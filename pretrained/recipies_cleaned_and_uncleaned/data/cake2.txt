Mocha Buttercream

cakes, toppings

1/4 cup instant coffee powder
2 teaspoon water
8 tablespoon (1 stick) unsalted butter at room t; emperature
1/4 cup confectioners sugar
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy (whipping); cream, chilled

Flavored lightly with coffee, this variation on Rosie's Buttercream
has a lovely cafe au lait color.

1. Dissolve the coffee in the water.

2. Place all ingredients in a food processor and process until light
and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Stop the machine several times to scrape
down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.

3. Transfer the buttercream to a medium sized mixing bowl and, using
the paddle attachment of an electric mixer, continue to beat on
medium-high speed, until the buttercream is white and fluffy, 15 to
20 minutes. Stop the mixer to scrape the bowl several times with a
rubber spatula (If you do not have a paddle attachment, you can use
the whisk) Use the buttercream for frosting within an hour or it will
need rewhipping.

Makes 2 to 2.1/4 cups, enough to fill and frost a two- or four-layer
cake

3/4 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon ground cloves or - to taste
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 single confectioners' sugar
1  ===========================
1  mocha cream filling/frosting
1 1/2 pint heavy cream
3 tablespoon instant coffee
1/4 cup superfine sugar + to taste
4 1/2 tablespoon sweetened cocoa

Source: The Uncommon Gourmet   - Adjusted by Suzy

CAKE ROLL: 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 10x15-inch jelly
roll pan.
Line the pan with wax paper and grease the paper.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar
together until the mixture is pale and fluffy.
3. Sift the flour with the salt, baking powder, and spices. Add the
dry ingredient to the batter.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff and gently
fold them into the batter.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared jelly roll pan. Bake for 20
minutes.
Remove from the oven and turn the cake over onto a clean linen
dish
towel that has been dusted with confectioners' sugar. Lift off the
pan and let the cake cool for 10 minutes. Peel off the wax paper
from
the cake. Carefully roll the cake with the towel, jelly roll
fashion,
and let the cake remain in this position on a rack for 20-30
minutes
while it cools completely.
6. When the cake is cooled, unroll to fill (IMPORTANT* If the cake is
even slightly warm, the whipped cream filling will weep.) Spoon a
generous amount of the mocha cream onto the inside of the cake,
smoothing it to within 1-inch of all the edges.
7. Roll the cake up to form a log. Place it seam side down on a
platter.
Spread the remainder of the mocha cream over the roll, frosting it
evenly. Run the tines of a fork along the top of the cake roll to
create decorative ridges resembling the bark of a tree.
Refrigerate
the cake roll until serving time. (If you choose to freeze the
dessert, wrap it loosely in saran wrap. Defrost 2 hours in the
fridge
prior to serving.)

MOCHA CREAM FILLING AND FROSTING: Cream to fill & frost one cake
roll =======================================================
================ 1. In a small saucepan, warm 1/2 pt. of the heavy
cream with the

the heat and chill well.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip all of the cream, sugar
and cocoa until stiff peaks form. Refrigerate until needed.

Mocha Truffle Cake

cakes, deserts

1 lb (4 sticks) unsalted butter, cut int; o pieces
1 lb semisweet chocolate
1 cup strong coffee
2 cup sugar
8  large eggs; room temperature frosting
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla chocolate flakes

CAKE: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Completely line the bottom and
sides of a 10-inch cake pan with foil, allowing some of the foil to
extend beyond the top of the pan. Smooth out the foil as much as
possible. Generously coat with some of the butter. Melt the chocolate
with the remaining butter, coffee, and sugar over low heat. Simmer
over low heat until the sugar dissolves. Beat the eggs until thick,
about 5 minutes. Stir into the chocolate mixture. Pour into the
prepared pan. Bake for approximately 50 minutes, or until the center
is just set. Cool completely in the pan. Cover and refrigerate in the
pan until firm, at least 8 hours or overnight. FROSTING: A few hours
prior to serving, whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla. Invert
cake onto a serving platter. Carefully remove the foil. Frost the
cake with the whipped cream. Garnish with the Chocolate Flakes. To
make Chocolate Flakes, melt semisweet chocolate and spread on a
marble slab or large flat plate. Let the chocolate harden. Scrape
against it with a knife and it will flake into thin pieces. Source:

Mocha Whipped Cream Filling (For Graham Crack

cakes

2 1/2 cup heavy cream, well chilled
1/3 cup strained confectioner's sugar
3 tablespoon strained unsweetened cocoa
1 teaspoon coffee zest (see note)
2 tablespoon kahlua or tia maria
1/2 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa, for garnish

Pour cream into a well-chilled mixing bowl.  Beat in an electric mixer
fitted with chilled beaters or whip attachment. Stir in the
confectioner's sugar and cocoa and beat on medium speed until the
cream begins to thicken. Add the coffee zest and liqueur.  Continue
whipping until cream reaches the soft peak stage, and remove from the
mixer. Finish beating by hand using a wire whisk, whipping until
cream is quite thick but not grainy. Refrigerate. Note:  to make
coffee zest, add 3 parts coffee crystals to 1 part boiling water. To
assemble the cake, split each layer into halves. Set the first layer
on a serving plate, top side down. Fit a 14-inch pastry bag with a
large no. 5 plain tube, and fill it 1/3 rd full with mocha whipped
cream.  Starting 1/2 inch from the edge, pipe a circle of cream
around the top of the layer. Fill center of the circle with
additional cream, smoothing surface with a large metal offset
spatula. Repeat with the second and third layers, placing them cut
side up. Arrange the top layer cut side down, aligning layers so the
sides of the cake are even. Empty the remaining whipped cream into
the pastry bag. Pipe 1/2 inch whipped cream dots on the top layer,
beginning at the outer edge. Each dot should touch the preceding one,
forming a ring. Continue working toward the center of the cake until
the entire surface is covered. Place 1/2 tsp cocoa in a very fine
mesh strainer. Gently tap the strainer over the surface of the cake
to give it a light dusting of cocoa.  Place the cake in the
refrigerator uncovered to chill, but remove from refrigerator at
least 1 hour before serving. Storage: Store leftover cake in the
refrigerator under a foil tent. This cake will keep for up to three
days.

Mock Hostess Cupcakes

cakes

1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp clour
2 1/2 tablespoon cocoa powder (preferably dutch proc; ess)
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  filling
1 cup heavy whipping cream
6 oz finely chopped white chocolate
1  glaze
3 oz finely chopped bittersweet chocolat; e
3 tablespoon boiling water
1  icing
1 tablespoon egg white, at room temperature
1 pinch of cream of tartar
1/2 cup plus 2 to 3 tbsp confectioner's sug; ar

These ultra-moist, dark chocolate mini-cupcakes are filled with creamy
white chocolate ganache. They're a variation on a whimsical cupcake
that Michael Roberts serves at Los Angeles's Trumps restaurant at
teatime.

CUPCAKES

Make the cupcakes:

1. Position a rack in the center and preheat oven to 325øF. Lightly
butter twenty-four 1-3/4" x 3/4" (1-oz) muffin of biscuit cups.

2. Into a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda,
and salt. Mix in the sugar. Make a well in the center. Whisk in the
water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla. Blend until smooth. (The batter
will be very thin.)

3. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups. Bake until a cake tester
inserted into the center of one of the cupcakes comes out clean,
about 12 to 14 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the pans on a wire rack
for 5 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the pans and finish cooling
on the rack.

Make the filling:

4. In a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the cream
to a boil. Add the white chocolate and remove from heat. let the
mixture stand briefly; stir until smooth. Transfer to a metal bowl
and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly, stirring occasionally. (To
speed the process, set the metal bowl over a larger bowl of ice
water; stir the chocolate mixture until cool.) With an electric
mixer, beat the whit chocolate mixture just until fluffy, about 1
minute.

5. Transfer the filling to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/8-inch plain
tip. Insert the pastry tip 1/4-inch into the bottom of each cupcake
and squeeze a little filling into each one.

Make the glaze:

6. Place the chocolate in a small bowl. Whisk in the boiling water and
blend until smooth. One at a time, dip the top of each cupcake into
the warm glaze. Turn the glazed cupcakes right side up and set them
on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet. Refrigerate the cupcakes for
5 minutes to set the glaze.

Make the icing:

7. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy. Stir in the
cream of tartar. Gradually mix in enough of the confectioner's sugar
to make a fairly stiff and smooth icing. Fill a small paper cone with
the icing and cut a 1/16-inch opening at the tip. Remove the cupcakes
from the refrigerator. Pipe a design (a squiggle, spiral, etc.) on
the top of each cupcake. Let the design harden and then cover and
refrigerate the cupcakes. Serve at room temperature.

The cupcakes can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance, or
frozen up to 2 weeks.

Makes 22 to 24 miniature cupcakes.

1 1/2 lb plain flour
3 teaspoon baking powder
6 oz lard
6 oz margarine
8 oz golden syrup
8 oz sugar
1  salt
1  milk as necessary

Remarks: This recipe can be found in many very old books, and may
have come form the Old Norse language, where a heap of corn was known
as Mugi. The word can be traced back through early English, where
corn was refered to as Muge and later Muga. In it's ealiest form, it
was probably made with yeast and honey instead of baking powder and
syrup/sugar.

Mondel Bread

breads, cakes, deserts

1 cup sugar
3  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup oil
1 1/2 cup walnuts or pecans
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 cup flour

Mix sugar and eggs in Mix Master.  Add the oil. Remove from the mixer
and proced by hand.  Add [finely chopped] nuts into the mixture and
add the other ingredients into the mixture with a wooden spoon.
Mixture must not be too soft not too stiff so you can roll it into a
salami shape.

Place rolls on a cookie sheet in a 350 [f] oven until golden brown.
Remove from the oven and cut into diagonal slices. Return to oven for
about 15-20 minutes.

I find that I have to chill it over night and add flour to each roll
so it will stand up as a roll and not flatten out-sometimes as much
as a cup or even more depending on the size of the eggs. Submitted By

Mrs. Pettigrew's Lemon Cake (Gfdm86a)

cakes

2  lemons
3/4 cup sugar
8 tablespoon (1 stick) soft butter
2  large eggs, beaten
3/4 cup flour
6 tablespoon milk
3 tablespoon sugar, for topping

Preheat oven to 325 F. Grease and line a 7 inch round cake pan or 8
inch loaf pan with parchment or wax paper. Grate the lemon rinds and
set aside. Combine the juice of 1 lemon with 3 T sugar in bowl and
set in a warm place until the sugar dissolves and forms a syrup with
the juice. Cream the margarine and the rest of the sugar together
until light and fluffy. Add the beaten eggs, a little at a time,
beating well after each addition. Stir in the grated lemon rind and
flour then beat again thoroughly (the longer you beat, the softer the
cake). Add the milk and beat again. Pour into the prepared pan and
bake for at least 1 hour. The cake should spring back when pressed
gently in the center. Immediately upon removing the cake from the
oven, prick the top with a long-tined fork or thin skewer and pour
the lemon juice-sugar syrup all over the top until completely
covered. Cool the pan to allow the syrup to be soaked up and create a
moist and tangy cake. Annette Thompson.

Nasty Spider Cake

cakes

1  cake mix
1 pkg green jello prepared
1  black frosting
8  licorice sticks
8  gumdrops

(once made as a tease for a woman who HATED spiders)

Take your average cake mix. Bake it up in 2 metal bowls--1 bigger
than the other. Once unmolded, cut the bigger one (the "body") in
half, horizontally. CAREFULLY scoop out an adequate cavity in each
half. FILL with well-whipped set green Jello, and reattach the
halves. Frost black, arrange on serving platter. Use licorice stix as
legs. Use 2 BIG green gumdrops and 6 little ones as eyes. When the
cake is cut into, it spurts green goop, just like a real spider when
stepped on.

Why not add a red hourglass to the back and make it toxic? ;-)

New Duchess Spice Cake W/ Maple Buttercream F

cakes, toppings

2 1/2 cup sifted cake flour or
2 1/3 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon nutmeg
3/4 teaspoon cloves
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup shortening
1 cup buttermilk
3  eggs

Grease and flour 2-9" layer cake pans or one 13x9" oblong pan. Sift
flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt
together. Add the brown sugar, shortening and buttermilk. Beat 2
minutes. Add eggs. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake layer pans for
30 to 35 minutes, oblong pan 45 minutes until cake tests done. Cool.
Frost.

MAPLE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING:

1/2    cup    Crisco shortening (regular only) 1/2 cup butter,
softened 1 tsp.   maple flavoring (like vanilla extract) 4 cups (1
lb.) powdered sugar 2
Tbsp.  milk

Cream butter and shortening.  Add maple flavoring. Gradually add
powdered sugar.  Gradually add milk and continue beating until light
and airy. Add more milk if needed. Color with paste colors.

This icing is a light yellow and colors you add will be affected by
this. For pure white icing, use 1 cup regular Crisco shortening and
1/2 tsp. Wilton butter flavoring. This icing is somewhat stiffer. For
blazing white, add Wilton White White.  Wilton White White will also
make the first buttercream recipe whiter, but be careful with colors
as they will still tend to be yellowish.

Note:  Excellent cake and frosting!

Not being quite as temporarily enhanced as some of the other members
of the echo, I remember Kate Smith as an older buxom gal who could
really belt out a tune and was fond of wearing her trademark
low-hemmed, dark, long-sleeved, V-necked dresses.  I was unaware that
in her younger days she had another persona.  She was a radio
personality with a cooking show. I know 'cause last weekend I picked
up a copy of her 1940 cookbook, "Kate Smith's Favorite Recipes,
Anniversary Edition".

The cover is worth framing.  It shows a very young Kate Smith in her
signature dress wearing a French maid type apron, bent forward a bit
at the waist and holding a wooden spoon up in her right hand. She
looks mostly like a clean shaven Dom Deluise in drag getting ready to
whack some unruly kid's knuckles. The sponsors of her show were
Calumet Baking Powder and Swan's Down Cake Flour, both of which I
believe are still going concerns. I think we should adopt Kate as the
patron saint of the echo and distribute a .gif of the cover of this
book with the "Cast" .gifs.

Here's a number from the book that utilizes both of her sponsor's
products.

Sift flour once, measure, add baking powder and salt and sift together
three times.  Cream butter thoroughly, add sugar gradually, and cream
together until light and fluffy. Add flour, alternately with milk, a
small amount at a time, beating after each addition until smooth. Add
flavoring. Fold in egg whites quickly and thoroughly. Bake in three
greased 9-inch layer pans in moderate oven (375F) for 20 to 25
minutes. Spread Chocolate Cream Filling between layers and Hungarian
Chocolate Frosting on top and sides of cake. When frosting is set,
write the numbers from one to twelve around top of cake with white
frosting to represent the face of a clock. Place hands of clock at
twelve o'clock.

CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLING:

Add chocolate to milk and heat in double boiler.  When chocolate is
melted, beat with rotary egg beater until blended. Combine sugar,
flour, and salt; add gradually to chocolate mixture and cook until
thickened, stirring occasionally.  Pour small amount of mixture over
egg yolks, stirring vigorously; return to double boiler and cook for
2 minutes longer, stirring constantly.  Add butter and vanilla, and
cool.

Makes 2 1/2 cups filling, or enough filling to spread between three
9- inch layers.  Use this filling in small cup cakes. Use 1/2 recipe
for filling 2 1/2 to
3    dozen small cup cakes.

HUNGARIAN CHOCOLATE FROSTING:

Melt chocolate in double boiler.  Remove from boiling water, add
sugar and water, and blend.  Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating
will after each. Add butter, a tablespoon at a time, beating
thoroughly after each amount.

Makes enough frosting to cover the top of one 9-inch layer and sides
of three 9-inch layers, or to cover the tops and sides of two 9-inch
layers. Eat lots of this and you too can look like Kate Smith!

1 cup sugar.
1 teaspoon vanilla.
1  egg.
1 cup buttermilk.
1 teaspoon soda.
3 cup flour.
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.
1 teaspoon salt.

Try mixing Vanilla and egg  beat until mixed. Add the Buttermilk and
the Soda; (I have used 7up) and sift the dry ingredients into this.
add the rest of the ingredients, mix well. Put the container into the
refrigerator chill over night. Take out and roll small pieces of the
dough into long strips, then form them into a figure eight,(like a
pretzel) put them back into the Refrigerator for about an hour, when
they have raised to approximately what looks to be the right hight.
Bake in a 450 deg pre-heated oven for approximately 6 to 8 minutes, (
May vary with the weather so keep an eye on them).But they should be
a light brown before you remove them. Refrigeration is one of the
keys of "KRINGLA" making. They must be refrigerated in order for them
to get the flavor, you could bake them without refrigeration but you
lose a lot of the flavor. You can also use.

A:  OATMEAL. B: RAISINS. C: WHOLE WHEAT.

You can fill them with your favorite filling, Cream Cheese, Jelly,
ETC. you don't need eggs or yeast. They are not too sweet, and
definitely not Boring like a bagel, (Sorry Bagel lovers, VBG). It is
a coffee Bread not like Muffins, which are too sweet, and also do not
have too many calories. This recipe came from a fella from the town
of LOS OSOS CA He is a out of work Carpenter who started baking and
selling these wonderful Rolls, He said that this is an original
recipe that he got from his grandmother, (Yea for the Grandmas). Ive
tried Nuts, and love the cream Cheese one, You could even use Custard
Filling, Ive also used Different flavored oils like Pure orange oil,
Butterscotch, several Berries types. and they turned out just great.

Nut Torte

cakes, deserts, vegatarian, vegetarian

3/4 cup margarine
2 1/4 cup sugar
1  egg replacer - (equivalent of 3 egg; s)
3 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 pinch salt
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup soy milk, plain or vanilla
2 cup chopped walnuts or almonds
1/2 cup vegan marzipan

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

To prepare the dough, cream the margarine with 3/4 cup sugar until
fluffy. Add the egg replacer, lemon juice, and salt and mix well. Add
the flour and baking powder, and mix until a soft dough is formed.

Place two-thirds of the dough on a sheet of plastic wrap. With a
rolling pin, roll the dough into a circle about 11 inches in
diameter. Invert the dough into a 9-inch springform pan. Peel the
plastic wrap off the dough and press the dough into the bottom and up
the sides of the pan. Trim the edges if needed. Roll the remaining
dough into a circle about 9 inches in diameter and set aside.  This
will be used to top the torte.

To prepare the filling, stir 1 cup of the sugar in a large heavy
saucepan over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the
heat and boil the sugar unti it turns a caramel color. Add the soy
milk (which will bubble vigorously) along with the nuts and the rest
of the sugar. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, for 5
minutes. Remove from the heat and beat the marzipan into the mixture.
When it is well mixed, pour it into the cake pan and put the
rolled-out dough on top.

Bake the torte until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cool completely
before removing the springform.

1  pinch of salt
2 tablespoon bacon fat or melted butter
1/4 pint hot water
1  extra oatmeal for rolling

little flour. If the flour browns at once it is too hot; it sould
take a few secounds to turn colour.
:       Set the oven to 375F/Gas 5 or heat a gridle or heavy
frying-pan. Mix the oatmeal, the bicarbonated of soda and salt
together in a bowl. Add the melted fat and the hot water. Stir well
until it makes a soft paste. Sprinkle some oatmeal on a board. From
the dough into a round and roll it out as thinly as possible, adding
oatmeal to the serface as necessary, to prevent sticking. Brush off
the excess oatmeal. Cut the dough into 4 or 6 pieces. To oven bake;
place on a large ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes. To
gridle bake; bake on a hot gridle or frying-pan until the edges begin
to curl. Turn over and cook the other side. Do not let the oatcakes
brown; they should be a pale fawn colour. Put on a wire rack to cool.
They are delicious served with cheese. :

Old Dominion Pound Cake

cakes

8 large egg; room temperature
2 1/4 cup flour, sifted
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup butter; room temp
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 cup walnuts; chopped very fine
1  sugar, confectioners

Alex Patout writes, "This is a special-occasion cake that we like to
serve with whipped cream.  It mellows with age, so make it at least
one day ahead of serving.  It keeps well in the refrigerator for
several days and freezes beautifully."

Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Butter and flour a Bundt or tube pan.
Separate the eggs.  Sift the flour with the baking soda and 1-1/4
cups of sugar. Place the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer and
cream it well. Beat in the flour-sugar mixture by thirds, then beat
in the lemon juice and vanilla.  Beat in the egg yolks one by one,
being sure each is absorbed before you add the next.

In a separate mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy.  Add the
salt and the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks
form. Gradually beat in the remaining 1 cup of sugar, and continue
beating until the mixture is glossy and holds stiff peaks.

Fold the nuts into the flour mixture, and gently fold in the beaten
egg whites.  Turn the batter into the prepared pan and gently cut
through the batter once or twice with a rubber spatula to break any
large air bubbles.

Bake the cake for 1-1/2 hours, or until a knife or toothpick inserted
near the center comes out clean.  Do not open the oven during the
first hour of baking.  Turn off the heat and let the cake sit in the
hot oven for 15 minutes.  Then remove and let cool in the pan for 15
minutes more. Remove the cake from the pan and sprinkle lightly with
confectioners' sugar. Let cool thoroughly, then wrap tight in foil.

Serve in thin slices, with whipped cream, if desired, or with the ice
cream described in the previous recipe.

1 pound butter 1 pound brown sugar 12 eggs separated 4 cups flour 2
teaspoons each cinnamon, mace, cloves (this is what makes it dark) 1
teaspoons each allspice, nutmeg, salt (this too) 1 pound mixed candied
fruit 1 pound candied cherries 1 pound seeded raisins 1 pound seedless
raisins 1 pound currants 1 pound pitted dates, cut in pieces 1/2 pound
diced citron (optional) I would leave this out citron is very strong
tasting and this is what people usually do not like in fruitcake. Use
candied pineapple instead. 1 pound broken walnuts 1 cup rum or brandy
1/2 cup double-strength coffee grated peel and juice of 3 medium
sized oranges grated peel and juice of 1 lemon

Cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add well
beaten egg yolks and stir vigorously until smooth and creamy. Sift
flour, measure, and sift with spices. Combine candied fruit,
cherries, seeded raisins, seedless raisins, currants, dates,
pineapple and walnuts, and mix lightly with 1 cup of the spiced
flour. Add remaining flour to batter, blending alternately with
mixture of rum, coffee, and fruit peel and juices. Add fruit and nut
mixture and mix well. Beat egg whites until they hold stiff peaks,
then fold into batter. Butter 4 loaf pans (5 X 9) line with brown
paper and butter again, Spoon in batter. Bake in a very slow oven 250
for 3 hours 30 minutes or until a tooth pick inserted comes out
clean. (I would put a shallow pan filled with water on the bottom
shelf of the oven.)

Old World Fruit Cake

cakes

      ----CAKE----
1 cup flour, all-purpose
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cloves
1/2 teaspoon mace
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup butter, melted
2  eggs
3/4 cup coffee (black), cold
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup raisins
1 cup fruit, mixed
1 cup dates
1/4 cup rum or brandy
      ----GLAZE----
4 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup rum or brandy
1/2 cup sugar

Mix the melted butter, eggs, rum and coffee together.  Add brown sugar and
mix well. Add rest of dry ingredients and place in a buttered loaf pan.

Bake at 300 degrees F. for 2 hours or until done (it will separate from the
sides of the pan).  Make glaze when almost completely baked: Melt (do not
boil) butter.  Add rum and sugar.  Stir by hand.  Remove the cake from the
oven and pour half of the glaze over it.  Let it cool 25 minutes, then turn
it over and pour the remaining glaze on the other side.

NOTES:

*  A traditional European-style fruit cake -- Although fruitcakes have a
bad reputation, this one is *excellent*. My mother has been making it for
years. She originally got the recipe from a friend, but has since adapted
it to suit her fans. (She gets requests for it all year long.)

*  Don't use glass pans.  This freezes well, if you make more than you can
eat; just be sure to wrap it carefully so it doesn't get freezer burn. Warm
frozen cake in the oven, not the microwave.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours baking, 30 minutes finishing.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Old-Fashioned Strawberry Shortcake

cakes, deserts, fruits/nuts

1 quart strawberries
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
1  buttermilk biscuit dough (recipe fo; llows)
2 tablespoon buttermilk
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon soft butter
      ----BUTTERMILK BISCUIT DOUGH----
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup cold unsalted butter
3/4 cup buttermilk or heavy cream  (or more; )

PLACE BERRIES in a colander and quickly rinse under running cold
water. Pour on a tray lined with several thicknesses of paper towel
to drain for 5 minutes. Hull the strawberries with the point of a
stainless-steel paring knife, then slice into a bowl. Sprinkle with
sugar and lemon juice, then set aside, covered, at room temperature
for an hour or two. Whip the cream (add a couple tablespoons of
sugar, if you like) until it holds a soft peak. Cover and
refrigerate. Preheat the oven to 450F; set rack in middle level.
Prepare biscuit dough. For a large shortcake, pat the dough into a
9-inch disk on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. For individual
shortcakes, pat dough into a 6-by-12- inch rectangle and cut into
eight 3-inch biscuits with a sharp, floured knife. Transfer to a
parchment-lined cookie sheet. Paint tops with buttermilk. Sprinkle
with sugar. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until well risen and golden.
Check the center of the large shortcake with a toothpick to make sure
it is baked through: If the pick emerges with dough still clinging to
it, lower temperature to 350F and bake another 5 minutes. Slide the
large shortcake onto a platter immediately after it is baked. Use a
sharp, serrated knife to slice through the middle, making two layers.
Slide the edge of a cookie sheet between the two layers and lift the
top layer off. Butter the bottom layer and pour all but 1/2 cup of the
sweetened berries on. Slide the top back on and pour the remaining
berries over the top. Split the small shortcakes in the same way and
place the bottoms on individual dessert plates. Butter them and top
with about 1/3 cup of the berry mixture. Replace tops and pour a
tablespoon or so of the remaining berries over the top. Serve
immediately. Pass the cream in a bowl for the guests to help
themselves. BUTTERMILK BISCUIT DOUGH: COMBINE THE FLOURS, salt and
baking powder in a mixing bowl and stir well to mix. Rub in the
butter by hand or with a pastry blender until the mixture is mealy.
Stir in 3/4 cup of the buttermilk with a fork and continue stirring
gently until the dough begins to hold together. (If the dough is dry,
add more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time.) Sprinkle the work
surface generously with flour and scrape the dough onto it. Fold the
dough over on itself two or three times. Use the dough immediately
for shortcakes, following the instructions above. Use this recipe to
make a large shortcake or eight small ones. This same dough is used
as the topping in cobbler recipes.

TO MAKE THE CAKE: Sift the unbleached flour and pastry flour together.
Return the flour to the sifte. In a 5-6 puart bowl, beat the egg

a large spatula. Repeat until all the flour has been incorporated.
Spoon batter into an ungreased 9-10 inch ungreased tube pan with
removable bottom. Level top with a spatula.  Bake at 325 F for about
40-50 minutes, or until the top is golden and springs back when
lightly touched. Invert the pan onto a wire rack and let the cake
cool for 1 hour. To remove the cake from the pan, run a thin knife
around the outside edges. Remove the outer portion of the pan. Run a
thin knife around the center tube and also around the center tube and
also around the bottom of the cake.  Invert the cake onto a serving
plate. Serve with the orange sections and orange cream. (If desired,

***NOTE***  To make the yogurt cheese, spoon about 4 cups of nonfat
yogurt into a sieve lined with a triple thickness of cheese cloth.
Place over a bowl, cover and refrigerate for 4 hours, or until very
thick.

Orange Angel Food Cake With Caramelized Pears

cakes

      ----CAKE----
1 1/2 cup egg whites, about 12 large
1 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 cup cake flour, sifted
1  pinch of salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 tablespoon orange rind; chopped  (colored part on
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
      ----PEARS----
8  ripe pears, peeled, cored,  sliced; 1/3-inch thick
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoon brandy
1  pinch of salt

This gussied-up version of an old favorite comes from "Stars Desserts"
(Harper Collins) by Emily Luchetti.

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. For cake, put the egg whites in
large bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on medium speed until frothy.
Add the cream of tartar. Increase to high speed and continue to mix,
slowly pouring in the sugar. Continue whipping until the whites have
increased to several times their original size and they form soft,
droopy white peaks.

2. Remove the bowl from the machine and fold in the flour, salt,
vanilla extract, orange rind and lemon juice.

3. Gently scoop the batter into an ungreased 10-inch angel food cake
pan. Bake until top is light brown and a skewer inserted in the
middle comes out clean, about
30    minutes.

4. When the cake has finished baking, invert the pan and allow it to
cool. If your pan does not have legs to rest on when inverted, invert
the inner tube of the pan onto a bottle. When the cake is completely
cool, run a knife around the inside edge of the pan and remove from
the pan.

5. For pears, combine the pears and the remaining ingredients in a
12-inch skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until the sugar starts to
caramelize lightly and the pears are soft but still retain their
shape, 10 to 15 minutes. As they begin to color, stir the pears
gently to prevent them from burning.

6. Serve the cake with warm or room-temperature caramelized pears and
raspberry sauce, if desired.

Orange Fluff Cake

cakes

1 1/2 cup sifted cake flour
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup strained fresh orange juice
2 teaspoon baking powder
6 large eggs, separated
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1  glaze:
1 cup sifted confectioner's sugar
2 tablespoon fresh orange juice
1 teaspoon grated orange zest

1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees F. Have ready an ungreased 10-inch tube pan with a removable
bottom. (Do not use a tube pan with a nonstick surface.)

2. Sift the flour, half cup sugar, the baking powder, and salt into a
medium-sized bowl. Form a well in the center and add the melted
butter, orange zest, orange juice, and the yolks, and vanilla. With
an electric mixer, beat until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.

3. In a large bowl combine the egg whites and cream of tartar; beat
with an electric mixer until soft peaks begin to form. Gradually beat
in the remaining half cup sugar and continue to beat until stiff
glossy peaks form. Stir a large spoonful of the whites into the
batter to lighten. With a spatula, quickly fold in the remaining egg
whites, half at a time, to make a fluffy batter that is even in
color. Turn into the ungreased tube pan and bake one hour to one hour
and 15 minutes, until the top springs back when lightly touched and a
toothpick inserted emerges without crumbs clinging to it. Immediately
invert and let the cake hang upside down until completely cool. (If
the pan does not have tabs on it's rim, place tube over the neck of a
bottle). Turn right side up and run a sharp knife around the edge to
separate the cake from the pan. Remove sides. Run a knife around the
center tube and under the cake; remove the pan bottom. Turn the cake
right side up on a serving plate.

4. Prepare glaze: In a small bowl combine the confectioner's sugar,
orange zest, and orange juice to make a glaze. Spread over the top of
the cake, letting some drip down the sides. Let stand at room
temperature until glaze has set, about one hour.

This is a nutty, old-fashioned spice cake traditional in the South.
When made with raspberry or blackberry jam it's called " Jam Cake".

For one Bundt cake, 10 to 12 servings, you will need:

Vanilla wafer crumbs Sliced oranges, for garnish

Caramel Frosting: Combine 3/4 cup light brown sugar, 1/4 cup whipping
cream, 2 teaspoons dark corn syrup, and a pinch of salt in a
saucepan. Add 2 tablespoons butter. Bring to a boil. Boil until syrup
reaches 234 degrees F on a candy thermometer or until a drop in cold
water forms a soft ball. Beat until cooled and creamy.

Preparation:

1. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar,
cinnamon, baking powder, soda, salt, cloves, nutmeg, butter,
marmalade, eggs, milk, lemon juice and nuts.

2. Blend at low speed, scraping the bowl. Increase speed to medium
and beat for 2 minutes.

3. Butter an 8 1/2-inch (10-cup) tube type pan. Dust with vanilla
wafer crumbs.

4. Pour batter into the prepared pan.

5. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55 minutes or just until a skewer
inserted in the center comes out clean.

6. Remove from the oven. Cool 5 minutes.

7. Turn out of pan and finish cooling on a rack.

8. Glaze with Caramel Frosting and garnish with sliced fruit.

Orange Pound Cake

cakes

1 lb butter
1 lb sugar, powdered
2 tablespoon orange rind, grated
6 large eggs
3 1/2 cup flour (all-purpose), sifted
1/2 teaspoon mace
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup orange juice
1 cup apricot jam, strained
2 tablespoon orange peel, shredded

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream butter until light and fluffy.
Gradually add sifted sugar and rind.  Cream thoroughly.  Add eggs, one at a
time, mixing well after each addition.

Sift the flour before measuring, then combine the dry ingredients.
Gradually add sifted dry ingredients to butter mixture. Add orange juice
and combine thoroughly.

Turn into buttered and floured 10-inch tube pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F.
for 50-60 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean and
cake is golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes. Turn onto wire rack and cool
thoroughly.  Brush with jam and top with orange peel.

NOTES:

*  A luscious orange-flavored pound cake -- Absolutely the best cake I have
ever eaten! I got the recipe from the mother of a friend.  I think Don's
mom got the recipe off the back of a sugar box.

*  If you try to make a pound cake with margarine or shortening you will
end up with a tasteless mess. Butter is the major taste in a pound cake;
even if it weren't, butter and margarine have different properties in
baking, and this recipe is adjusted for butter.

*  Don't make this cake if you don't have an electric mixer or very strong
wrists.  I figure I spend nearly half an hour beating butter and such when
I make this cake. Also, this cake is easier to handle if you have a tube
pan that comes apart into two pieces.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  30-40 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Orange-Ooze Cupcakes

cakes, deserts, kids, halloween

      ----FILLING----
8 oz cream cheese; softened
1  egg
1/3 cup sugar
1  yellow and red food coloring
6 oz chocolate chips
      ----CUPCAKES----
3 cup flour
2 cup sugar
1/2 cup cocoa
2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup water
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoon cider vinegar
2 teaspoon vanilla

Preparation time:  20 to 25 minutes Cooking time: 25 minutes Utensils:
Measuring cups and spoons, cupcake baking pans, paper cupcake liners,
two small mixing bowls, electric mixer, mixing spoon, large mixing
bowl, oven mitts.

Preheat oven to 350F.  Line cupcake baking pans with paper cupcake
liners.

In small mixing bowl, use electric mixer to combine cream cheese, egg
and sugar.  Blend in 2 drops yellow food coloring and 1 drop red food
coloring, adding more coloring if necessary to reach desired shade.
Use mixing spoon to stir in chocolate chips; set filling aside.

In large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and
salt; set aside.

In second small mixing bowl, combine water, vegetable oil, vinegar and
vanilla.  Add contents of small mixing bowl to large mixing bowl and
stir with mixing spoon to combine.

Using mixing spoon or soup spoon, fill cupcake liners half full with
cupcake batter, then place 1 teaspoon filling at center of each. As
cupcake bakes, the batter will rise to surround the filling.

Wearing oven mitts, place cupcake pans in oven; bake approximately 25
minutes or until cupcakes test done.

When done, wear oven mitts to remove pan from oven and turn off oven.

If desired, frost with orange icing--or just let the orange filling

Panettone

cakes, holiday, ethnic, low cal

1 cup candied cherries
1/4 cup marsala
3 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 teaspoon quick-rising dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
2/3 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon vanilla
2  eggs
2  egg yolks
1  zest of half an orange
1/2 cup nuts (pine nuts, walnuts, or hazeln; uts)
1/2 cup green candied pineapple edges
1  powdered sugar for dusting on the t; op

An Italian Christmas is not complete without this high-domed cylinder
of fruit-studded sweet bread. This recipe has an option of using the
microwave to make the bread rise. Soak the cherries in the wine. In
the processor bowl fitted with steel blade, combine flour, sugar,
salt, yeast and nutmeg. Pulse to mix. Cut butter into pieces and
arrange on the top. Pulse to blend so that it almost disappears. In a
glass measure, combine the milk and water. Microwave on high about 40
seconds (see power levels), then with a fork, whisk in the vanilla,
eggs, and egg yolks. With the processor motor running, drizzle the
liquids very slowly into the flour mixture processor. Process 60
seconds. Add orange zest and pulse to mix. Transfer to large glass
mixing bowl and cover loosely with plastic wrap. To use the microwave
for bread rising, place the bowl in the microwave. Place an 8-ounce
glass of water in the back of the microwave. Lower the microwave to
low (see power levels). Place the dough in the microwave. Heat on low
for 3 minutes. Rest for 3 minutes. Heat on low for 3 minutes longer.
Rest for 6 minutes, or until the batter has risen to double in bulk
and is bubbly and light. Or let the dough rise in a warm draft-free
place about 45 to 60 min. When dough has doubled in bulk, stir the
batter down, then stir in the cherry mixture, nuts and candied
pineapple until well distributed. Grease generously and lightly flour
two, 1-pound coffee cans. Cut a parchment or wax paper circle to fit
the bottom of each can and add it, dusting and flouring it as well.
Spoon the batter into the cans, filling about halfway. Press down
slightly. Let rise in a warm, draft free place until nearly doubled
in bulk, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Just before popping it in the oven, cut an X in the tops of the
loaves with a razor. Italian bakers put a blob of butter into the
cut. Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour, or until evenly browned and a
skewer stuck in the center comes out clean. Remove immediately to a
rack to cool, then 15 minutes later, slide the cakes out of the pans
and lay them on their sides to continue cooling. Dust with powdered

2  eggs
8 teaspoon reduced-calorie margarine

2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/3 cup buttermilk or sour milk
1/2 cup shortening, butter or..
1  ..margarine
1 teaspoon vanilla
4  egg whites

Preheat oven to 350F. In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, and 1/8 tsp. salt. Add buttermilk, shortening (butter or
margarine) and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping
bowl. Beat on medium to high speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl
occasionally. ADd egg whites and beat for 2 minutes more, scraping
bowl.

Pour into 2 greased and floured 9 x 1/5 inch round baking pans. Bake
for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool on wire
racks for 10 minutes. Loosen sides and remove from pans. Serves 12.

NOTE: One day my husband Pat wanted a marble cake. So, I improvised.
To make a marble cake from this recipe, simply reserve one third of
the cake batter before putting in the cake pans. Then, melt one
square unsweetened or semi-sweet chocolate either over boiling water
or in the microwave oven. Stir to blend. Add to the cake mixture and
mix well. Put one half of the chocolate batter in each cake pan in
dollops, and swirl carefully, so as not to mix the white batter with
the chocolate. What you are trying to achieve in a marble effect.
Bake as directed. (BTW, this is GREAT!!)

Pineapple Upside-Down Cake (Light)

cakes, deserts

1 tablespoon butter, softened
1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
3 can pineapple slices (8oz cans)  in uns; weetened juice
9  maraschino cherries
1 cup cake flour
3/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup thawed frozen egg substitute  equiv; alent to 1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon coconut extract

Brush bottom and sides of 9-inch square baking pan with butter.
Sprinkle brown sugar over bottom of pan.
Drain pineapple slices reserving 1/2 cup juice. Arrange 9 pineapple
slices on brown sugar in pan. Place 1 maraschino cherry in center of
each pineapple slice. Puree 2 pineapple slices. Reserve remaining
pineapple slice for another use.
Stir together cake flour, sugar and baking powder in bowl. In
another container, combine 1/4 cup pureed pineapple, 1/2 cup
pineapple juice, egg substitute, vanilla and coconut extract. Quickly
combine liquid ingredients with dry ingredients, stirring just until
blended.
Pour batter over pineapple in pan, spreading evenly. Bake at 350
degrees 20 to 25 minutes or until cake tests done in center and is
golden brown. Cool about 5 minutes.
Loosen cake around edges of pan.  Place inverted serving platter
over cake and turn both upside down. Shake gently, then remove pan.
Slice into squares and serve warm. Makes 9 servings.

Each serving contains about: 221 calories; 103 mg sodium; 3 mg
cholesterol; 2 grams fat; 51 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams protein;
0.3 gram fiber.

When preparing the cake, stir the liquid and dry ingredients
together just until blended --- overmixing causes toughness. Also
watch the baking closely. Bake only until the center of the cake
tests done -- overbaking causes dryness and toughness.
After baking, let the cake stand a few minutes, then loosen the
edges with a knife.  Invert the cake into a serving platter to reveal
the fruit-and-sugar glaze. This cake is best when eaten warm. You may
want to serve it with nonfat frozen yogurt or a dollop of low-fat
whipped topping.

Pink Champagne Cake

cakes

2 3/4 cup sifted flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup shortening
1 1/2 cup sugar
3/4 cup champagne
6  egg whites
6 large marshmallows -- quartered
      ----COCONUT FILLING----
1/4 cup butter
16 large marshmallows -- quartered
1 tablespoon white wine
1 cup coconut -- flaked
      ----FONDANT FROSTING----
1 lb powdered sugar
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 dash salt
1  few drops almond extract
2  to 3 drops red food coloring

Resift flour with baking powder and salt.  Cream shortening with 1 cup
sugar until light and fluffy. Blend in flour mixture and champagne
alternately, mixing to smooth batter.

Beat egg whites until stiff.  Gradually beat in remaining 1/2 cup
sugar, continuing to beat to stiff meringue. Fold about half of
meringue into batter, mixing gently but thoroughly with whisk. Gently
fold in remaining meringue. Turn into 2 greased and floured 9" cake
pans. Bake at 350 degrees 25-30 minutes, just until cake tests done.
Let stand 10 minutes then turn out onto wire racks to cool. When
layers are cool, fill with Coconut Filling between layers.  Using 2/3
cup Fondant Frosting, spread thin layer smoothly over top and sides.
This seals any crumbs. Pour about 1/2 cup additional frosting over
top of cake and spread quickly to smooth layer. Cover sides of cake
with second layer of frosting. Dip marshmallow quarters in remaining
frosting to coat both sides and set randomly over top and sides of
cake.  Makes 10-12 servings.

Coconut Filling

Combine butter, marshmallows and wine in top of double boiler. Set
over simmering water and stir occasionally until marshmallows are
melted. Remove from heat and stir in coconut.  Cool until thick
enough to spread.

Fondant Frosting

Sift sugar into top of double boiler.  Add corn syrup and water. Stir
over simmering water until smooth. Blend in vanilla, salt, and almond
extract. Stir in food color, if desired. Keep frosting warm while
using so it spreads smoothly.

Poor Man's Cake

cakes, deserts, low fat

1 cup brown sugar
1 1/4 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable shortening *
1 teaspoon salt
2 cup flour
2/3 cup raisins
1/2 teaspoon nutmaeg
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cloves
1 teaspoon soda
2 teaspoon water
1 teaspoon baking powder

(the name comes from the fact that the cake calls for no eggs, no
milk, and no butter)

*NOTE:  (Since the shortening is melted, I substituted Canola oil,
thus, I think, saving a LOT of cholestrol and saturated fats!)

Boil brown sugar, 1 1/4 C water, oil or shortneing, raisins and spices
together for three minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.

Add salt and baking soda, dissolved in 2 tsp water. Sift together
flour and baking powder, add gradually, beating after each addition.

Grease and flour 8" square pan.  (I used nonfat spray instead).

Bake at 325 for approximately 50 minutes, until it tests done.

Needs no frosting.

(would be HEAVENLY with a big blob of whipped cream...but it's really
unnecessary.  this sucker is GOOD!)

Poor Man's Fruitcake

cakes

2 cup water
2 cup raisins
1 cup shortening
2 cup sugar
3 cup flour
1 tablespoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon cloves
1 cup walnuts

Bring the water, raisins, shortening and sugar to a boil, then set
aside and let cool.  Sift together the flour, salt, baking soda and
spices and add to the raisin mixture. Dust the walnuts with flour to
prevent them sinking, then fold them in.

Line a ten-inch angel food cake pan with parchment, and grease and
butter the pan. Pour in the batter and bake at 325 F. for one hour.
It is suggested that you can add half a pound pound of candied fruit
to this for Christmas; as usual I would just add pineapple and
cherries.

My special notes say not to turn pan over but to lift it out of the
angel food cake pan and keep the cake upright.

Poppy Seed Bread (Cake)

cakes, deserts, holiday, preserves

3 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon poppy seeds
3  eggs
1 1/8 cup cooking oil
1 1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
      ----GLAZE----
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon butter flavoring
1/2 teaspoon almond flavoring
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 cup orange juice
3/4 cup powdered sugar (sifted)

Blend all cake ingredients together with a mixer. Pour into greased
loaf 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pans.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.
Yield: 2 loaves GLAZE: Mix all glaze ingredients together. Pour over
bread when it is done. NOTE: I use orange/pineapple juice instead of
plain orange juice. I've had it made either way and like both
versions equally. I just happen to buy the juice blend regularly and
seldom buy plain orange juice. (Nancy) TO BAKE IN JARS: Grease 5
wide-mouth pint canning jars. Divide dough evenly between jars. (Jars
will be slightly over 1/2 full.) Bake at 325 degrees for 50 minutes.
Pull jars out of oven 1 at a time. Pour glaze over hot bread.
Immediately apply and firmly tighten a two-piece wide-mouth canning
lid. The lid will form a vacuum seal as the jar cools. Jars of canned
bread may be stored on the pantry shelf with other canned foods or
may be placed in a freezer.  The bread is safe to eat as long as jars
remain vacuum sealed and free of mold growth. (Nancy)

Poppyseed Bundt Cake

cakes

1 cup butter (or margarine)
1 1/2 cup sugar
2 1/2 cup flour (sift before measuring)
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup buttermilk
2 oz poppy seeds (about 1/4 cup)
1 teaspoon almond extract (or vanilla extract)
4  eggs (separated)
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Soak poppyseed in the buttermilk for 15 minutes.

Cream together butter and sugar.  Add yolks to creamed mixture.  Add almond
extract or vanilla.  Add dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk
mixture, a little at a time.

Beat egg whites very stiff as for angel food.  Fold egg whites into
mixture. Pour half of this batter mixture into well-greased Bundt pan.
Sprinkle with a mixture of about 1/4 cup brown sugar and about 1 t
cinnamon.  Pour in remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour.
Cool and invert onto serving dish, then remove Bundt pan.

NOTES:

*  A light, delicate cake -- I got this recipe from my mom.  I'm not sure
where she got it.

*  When folding in egg whites, be gentle.  Lift and turn the batter instead
of using a stirring motion. Don't worry if a little bit of egg white
remains unmixed; the egg whites will collapse if you mix it too much.

*  I have tried both vanilla and almond extracts with this recipe, and
prefer the former.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate (folding the beaten egg whites into the
batter takes some skill).
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.
: Precision:  Measure carefully.

Portuguese Almond & Potato Cake

cakes, portuguese

1 large baking potato, about 10 ounces
1 cup almonds, with skins
2 teaspoon baking powder
3 large eggs, separated
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 tablespoon brandy
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1  powdered sugar
1  marzipan potatoes, optional (see re; cipe)

Bake or microwave potato until soft.  Force pulp through a coarse
sieve or potato ricer.  There should be 1 cup lightly packed. Set
aside to cool.

Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter sides of an 8 1/2-inch spring form pan,
line base with a circle of baking parchment; butter the parchment.
Using a nut mill, grind almonds to powder, stir in baking powder; set
aside.

Beat egg whites until they start to stiffen, sprinkle with half of the
sugar, a little at a time, and continue beating until stiff and
glossy.

Beat butter with remaining sugar, then beat in egg yolks, brandy, and
almond extract.  Using a large rubber spatula, fold in potato, ground
almonds and egg whites.

Spoon into prepared pan; bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until a tester
comes out dry.  Let cool in pan for 10 minutes.

Run a knife blade around edge before releasing sides of pan. Place
cake, on the base, on a rack and let cool completely. Cake will sink
slightly in the middle.  Reverse cake onto a plate, peel off paper
and place right side up on a serving plate.  Dust with powdered sugar
before serving.

MARZIPAN "POTATOES":  You'll need 4 ounces marzipan or almond paste
and powdered unsweetened cocoa.

Pinch off pieces of marzipan and roll into elongated balls, each
about the size of a large marble.  Make these slightly irregular,
like tiny new potatoes. Roll in cocoa to simulate brown potato skin.
Cut several in half to show the white interior.  Arrange a little
group on top of the cake, and place the rest in twos and threes
around the edge of the plate.

Serves 10.

Portuguese Coffee Buttercake

cakes

1 cup unsalted butter, softened (no subst; itutions)
1 cup sugar
4 large eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  coffee buttercream
3/4 cup milk
6 large egg yolks
1 cup sugar
4 teaspoon instant coffee powder
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cup unsalted butter, softened (no subst; itutions)

Prep time:  1-1/2 hours plus cooling Baking time: 10 to 12 minutes per
batch

Cake Wafers

Cake wafers:  Preheat oven to 350 deg. F.  Invert two (or more if you
have them) 9-inch round cake pans; grease and flour bottoms of pans.

Beat butter in mixer bowl until smooth.  Beat in sugar until light and
fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Beat in vanilla. Beat in flour and salt just until combined.

Spread 1/3 cup batter evenly on each inverted cake pan to within 1/4
inch of edge.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes, until lightly browned around
edges. With long, thin metal spatula, loosen each wafer and transfer
to wire racks to cool completely.  Repeat on buttered, floured pans
with remaining batter to make a total of 12 wafers. (Can be made
ahead. Stack between sheets of wax paper and cover tightly, up to 2
days.)

Coffee buttercream:  Heat milk in medium saucepan over medium heat
just to boiling.  Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks and sugar together in
medium bowl. Gradually whisk in hot milk. Return mixture to saucepan;
cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until mixture
thickens and coats back of spoon, about 6 minutes. (Do not boil.)
Strain through sieve into mixer bowl.  Stir in coffee powder and
vanilla. Cool to room temperature. Beat in 2 cups butter, 1
tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition.

To assemble, place 1 cake wafer on serving platter. Spread evenly
with 1/3 cup buttercream.  Add second wafer and 1/3 cup more
buttercream; repeat with remaining wafers and buttercream, ending
with wafer. Pipe remaining buttercream decoratively on top.  (Can be
made ahead. Cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours.) Remove from
refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. Makes 16 servings.

PS:  This makes a big cake which will keep much longer than I've ever
seen one last.  It's also almost impossible to overbake. A couple
years ago I was making one as an Xmas gift for friends. I went to
bed, forgetting to remove the cake from the oven, and it baked all
night long. When I finally got it out of the oven (over 7 hours after
it went in) the cake was perfectly OK except for a suface layer about
«" deep that was a bit dry. I made another cake for the gift, but my
family gobbled the "mistake" in short order.

prolonged steeping of the spice in brandy and other alcohol. I have
been making this brandy cake for years and decided to try it with
saffron. It did not work; the saffron did not come through at all. My
tasters loved the cake, however, and suggested the saffron go in some
kind of icing instead. Great suggestion.

Cream butter and sugar, then add eggs, one at a time. Sift flour and
add it gradually.  Add remaining ingredients, mix just until
combined. Preheat oven to 375F (190C). Bake in a greased and floured
bundt or ring pan for about 50 minutes.  Cool in pan for 10 minutes,
then on cooling rack.

LEMON CREAM:

Steep saffron in lemon juice for 20 minutes.  Whisk eggs and sugar,
then add juice.  Switch to non-wooden utensil and cook cream in top
of double boiler until thick. Incorporate butter and cool before
using.

Pound Cake~ Little House Style

cakes, deserts

1 lb butter, unsalted
1 lb sugar, granulated
8 medium eggs
1 pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, ground
1/2 teaspoon mace, ground
4 cup flour, sifted

At least an hour before starting, set out all refrigerated
ingredients to warn to room temperature.

In a large bowl, cream butter until fluffy. Gradually work in the
sugar and blend until mixture is no longer grainy.

Add salt to eggs; beat eggs until light-colored and foamy, about five
minutes. Add nutmeg and mace to eggs.

Stir eggs gradually into sugar-butter mixture. Sift flour and beat in
gradually, stirring only long enough to blend all ingredients. The
finished batter will be quite stiff.

Smooth the batter into an ungreased tube pan. Bake in a preheated 350
oven for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to 325 and continue to bake
another 30 minutes. When a new broomstraw or toothpick poked in the
center comes out dry and the cake edges pull away from the pan,
remove pan from oven and cool. Turn cake out and serve unfrosted.

Pour La France's Fudge Caramel Cake

cakes, deserts, sauces

2  9-inch layers of choc. cake
1  fudge icing (recipe)
1  caramel sauce (recipe)
1 1/2 cup cashews, roasted, unsalted
2 cup heavy cream
2 1/2 lb semisweet chocolate
1/3 cup light corn syrup
1 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
2 teaspoon butter
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup heavy cream

FOR CAKE:
Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to make 4 round cake
layers.  Place 1 layer on plate and top with Fudge Icing, Caramel
Sauce and Cashews. Repeat with next 2 cake layers. Place final cake
layer on top, frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing and cover
sides of cake with chopped cashews. FUDGE ICING: Bring cream to boil.
Stir in chocolate until melted and smooth. This will be very soft but
will harden when cooled. Refrigerate until workable consistency.
NOTE: The time it takes to get to a workable consistency depends on
the weather. This is much like making fudge candy. The author,
(Arlene Lightsey), made this sauce on a cool, clear day and had no
problem. CARAMEL SAUCE: Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and reduce
to thick syrup. Very carefully, (because it will splatter), add
cream. Refrigerate until cool. Recipe from Pastry Chef Jenny
Mattingsley, of Pour la France, 7959 Broadway, San Antonio,

Prinzregent Torte

cakes, austrian

      ----CAKE----
9 oz butter, salted
9 oz sugar
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 large eggs, beaten
1 2/3 cup cake flour, about (sift before meas; uring!!)
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon baking powder
      ----FILLING----
2 cup chocolate pudding (extra strong)
7 oz butter, unsalted
1 2/3 cup powdered 10x sugar
      ----FROSTING----
1 oz cocoa powder, bitter
1 oz butter (sweet), melted
3 tablespoon water, boiling (up to 4 t)

In an electric mixer, whip the salted butter.  Add sugar, vanilla and
eggs. Beat smooth.  Mix flour with cornstarch and baking powder and
sift a second time (you sift it once before you measured it, right?).
Add flour mixture to egg mixture, stirring constantly.

Make 8 layers, each less than about 1/4 inch thick, by baking each in
the bottom of an 8-inch springform layer pan. Do this by cutting a
round of baker's parchment that exactly fits the bottom of the layer
pan, then using a spatula to spread the dough evenly over the
parchment. Make sure that it doesn't get too thin at the edges. Bake
each layer for 7 minutes in a preheated 400 degree F. oven.  Stack
the layers separated by waxed paper.

MAKE THE PUDDING:  Use more chocolate in the pudding than you would
normally use. If you want to be lazy and use pudding from a mix, then
add about a tablespoon of top-quality cocoa to the pudding mix. Stir
the pudding while it cools so that it does not congeal. Beat the
unsalted butter until it is very smooth. When the butter and pudding
are about the same temperature, add the pudding to the butter to get
an even, smooth buttercream.

Use the pudding/butter mixture as mortar, and layer the cake together,
spreading the pudding/butter evenly between the layers. Make sure the
layers are even and parallel; if they are not, or if one is not
straight, you can mend things with a little extra pudding here and
there. Do not put pudding on top of the topmost layer, and try not to
get too much on the outside edges.

MAKE A CHOCOLATE FROSTING:  Sift the powdered 10X sugar and cocoa
together, add the melted butter while stirring constantly, then add
boiling water. Frost the cake, taking pains to make sure the sides
are perfectly smooth and the top is perfectly smooth. Let the cake
sit at cool room temperature for at least an hour before serving.

NOTES:

*  Austrian 8-layer chocolate cake -- I made this recipe for my
boyfriend on his birthday and he asked me to marry him (I did). I'm
not saying for sure that the Prinzregent Torte is why Don wanted to
marry me, but I've always worried that it might have been. It is a
magnificent recipe that always evokes incredulous cries of pleasure
from people that I serve it to. The cake is a lot of work, so I only
make it about once a year, but the people that I make it for feel
very special. Yield: Serves 2-8.

*  If you are not an experienced baker, you should be warned that in
recipes like this it is important to measure exactly and to follow the
instructions exactly. People who prefer to cook by testing, tasting,
and adding more ingredients should avoid intricate baking.

*  These layers are baked in the bottom of a springform pan. Such a
pan bottom is about 8 inches in diameter, and has a raised lip that
is about 1/8 inch high. It resembles a miniature pizza pan. I have
never succeeded in making this torte with layers bigger than about 10
inches; about 8 inches is easier. The baker's parchment is crucial
and there is no good substitute, though buttered kraft paper (from
shopping bags) will work in a pinch. Use a new piece of parchment for
each layer. If you don't make the layers straight, then when you pile
them up, the cake will be mounded up in the middle or will sag down
in the middle or will tilt to one side.

*  If you are not an experienced cake froster, then make double the
recipe of frosting. Unskilled frosters usually use too much frosting,
and you don't really want to run out. You can charge money to people
who want to lick the spoon if there is any left over.

Difficulty:  rather difficult;  Time:  1 hour; Precision: measure
carefully.

Pumpkin Cake With Seafoam Frosting

cakes, deserts, holiday

3 cup sifted cake flour (sifted before me; asuring)
3 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1/4 teaspoon cloves, ground
1 cup cooked or canned pumpkin
1/2 cup milk
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup light-brown sugar,packed
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
2  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour three 8-by-1
1/2-inch layer-cake pans. Sift flour onto waxed paper with baking
powder, soda salt, cinnamon, cloves. 2. In a 2-cup measuring cup,
combine pumpkin and milk, mixing well. Turn granulated and brown
sugars, butter, eggs and vanilla extract into large bowl of electric
mixer; beat at high speed about 5 minutes, occasionally

scraping side of bowl with rubber scraper. 3. At low speed, beat in
flour mixture (in fourths) alternately with pumpkin mixture (in
thirds). Beat just until smooth-1 minute. Pour batter into pans; bake
30 to 35 minutes, or until surface springs back when gently pressed
with fingertip. Cool in the pans 10 minutes. 4. Remove from pans;
cool completely on wire rack. Make Frosting: In top of double boiler,
combine 1/4 cup egg whites, 1 1/2 cups light-brown sugar, packed, 1
tablespoon light corn syrup and 1/3 cup water. With an electric
rotary beater, beat 1 minute to combine. 5. Cook over rapidly boiling
water, beating constantly, about 7 minutes, or until stiff peaks form
when beater is slowly raised. Remove from boiling water. Add 1
teaspoon vanilla extract; then continue beating until the frosting is
thick enough to spread-about 2 minutes. 6. Place a layer on plate,
top side down; spread with 1 cup frosting; sprinkle with 1/2 cup
chopped walnuts. Repeat with second layer, top side down. Frost cake
with rest swirling decoratively. Garnish edge with walnut halves.
Refrigerate till serving. Serves 12

Pumpkin Coffee Cake

cakes, deserts

1/4 cup milk, scalded
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105-15 degrees f.)
1  egg, lightly beaten
2 1/4 cup unsifted flour (about)
1  egg yolk, beaten with 1 tablespoon; cold water (glaze)
1  filling:
3/4 cup cooked, mashed pumpkin
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
1/4 cup seedless raisins
1  frosting:
1/2 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon milk or light cream
1/8 teaspoon vanilla

Dough:

Mix milk with sugar, salt, and butter, stirring until sugar disolves;
cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle yeast over warm water and stir until
disolved.

Combine milk and yeast mixtures add egg and half the flour, and beat
until smooth and elastic, adding only enough extra flour to keep
dough from sticking. Place dough in a greased bowl, turn to grease
all sides, cover with cloth, set in a warm, draft-free place, and let
rise about 1 hour until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, turn onto
a lightly floured board, and roll into a rectangle about 22"x10". Mix
pumpkin with sugar, spieces, and salt and spread evenly over dough,
not quite to edges. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup walnuts and the raisins.
Roll up jelly-roll fashion from the wide side, lify to a greased
baking sheet, and coil into a ring. Cover and let rise in a warm
place about 1 hour until doubled in bulk. Meanwhile, preheat oven to
350 degrees F. Brush ring with egg glaze and bake 30-35 minutes until
well browned and hollow sounding when tapped. Mix frosting
ingredients together until smooth and frost ring while still warm;
sprinkle with remaining nuts. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Pumpkin Spice Cake In Jars

cakes, deserts

1 cup seedless raisins
1 cup walnuts
2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ground cloves
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
4 large eggs
2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup salad oil  (use fresh oil only)
16 oz cn pumpkin (not pie filling)

Preheat oven to 325-degrees.

Sterilize 8 Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400-81400) jam/jelly canning
jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Remove the jars
and allow them to air-dry on your countertop; leave the lids and
rings in the water until you're ready to use them. Once the jars are
cool enough to handle, grease the insides with shortening (DO NOT use
butter, margarine, PAM or Baker's Secret).

Coarsely chop the raisins and walnuts; set aside. I used my mini
chopper and did them in batches.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves,
cinnamon and ginger in a lg bowl. Add raisins and walnuts; toss to
lightly combine; set aside.

In another large bowl, beat eggs at high speed until thick and
yellow (2-3 minutes). Gradually beat in the sugar until thick and
light. At low speed, beat in the oil and pumpkin; blend well.
Gradually stir in the flour mixture until well blended. Divide batter
among the 8 canning jars (should be slightly less than 1/2 full).
Wipe the sides of the jar off in case you slop or it'll burn (mine
did -- didn't wipe them down). Place jars on a cookie sheet or
they'll tip over.

Bake in preheated 325-degree oven for about 40 minutes or until
toothpick inserted into center of cakes (deep) and comes out clean.
Move the jars around in the oven while they're baking so they bake
evenly.

When cakes test done, remove them one-by-one (use HEAVY DUTY mitts);
place a HOT lid, then a ring on and screw down tightly. Place jars
onto your countertop to cool completely.

Pumpkin Spice Cake In Jars  (Oven Method)

cakes, fruits, gifts

1 cup seedless raisins
1 cup walnuts
2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ground cloves
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
4  eggs
2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup salad oil (use fresh oil)
1 can (16 oz) pumpkin or   *
2 cup freshley cooked and mashed pumpkin
* do not use pumpkin pie filling.

Preheat oven to 325  F.  Grease the inside of 8 - 1 pint
wide-mouth Kerr or Ball canning jars or Ball Quality Crystal (12 oz.)
with Crisco (do not use a spray like Pam or Baker's Secret); set
aside. The 1 pint jars are shorter but bigger around and hold more
than the decorative 12 oz. jars, use either one.  The 1 pint jars
don't come with labels though, so you'll have to make your own.
Coarsely chop the raisins and walnuts; set aside. I used my mini
chopper and did them in batches.
Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves,
cinnamon, and ginger into a large bowl. Add raisins and walnuts; toss
lightly to combine.
In another large bowl, beat eggs at high speed until thick and
yellow (2-3 minutes).  Gradually beat in the sugar until thick and
light. At low speed, beat in the oil and pumpkin; blend well.
Gradually stir in the flour mixture until well blended.
Divide mixture among the 7 or 8 canning jars (should be slightly
less than 1/2 full).  Wipe the sides of the jar in case you slop, or
it'll burn. Place jars on a cookie sheet or they'll tip over.
Bake in a preheated 325  F. oven for about 40 minutes or until
toothpick inserted into center of cakes (deep) comes out clean. When
cakes test done, remove them, one at a time and immediately place the
lids and rings on them.
You must boil the lids, rings, and jars for 10 minutes to
sterilize them before using.  Keep the lids in the hot water until
you use them. Take them out, one by one and put them onto the jars.
If you'd like to make a regular cake out of this without messing
with the jars:
Grease a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan.  Bake in preheated 350 F.
oven for 50 minutes or until cake tests done. If you like spicy cake,
this will be one of your favorites. Ellie

Pumpkin Spice Cake In Jars Lawrence

cakes

1 cup seedless raisins
1 cup walnuts
2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ground cloves
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
4  eggs
2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup salad oil
16 oz canned pumpkin

Preheat oven to 325-degrees.

Sterilize 8 (12 oz) Ball Quilted Crystal Canning Jars (14400-81400),
lids and rings by boiling them for 10 minutes. Leave the lids and
rings in the hot water until you're ready to use them; remove jars
and allow the jars to air-dry and cool. Prepare the batter in the
meantime.
Using a pastry brush, brush the inside of the cooled jars with
shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret); set aside.

Coarsely chop the raisins and walnuts; set aside.
Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves,
cinnamon and ginger in a large bowl. Add raisins and walnuts; toss to
lightly combine.

In another large bowl, beat eggs at high speed until thick and
yellow (2-3 minutes). Gradually beat in the sugar until thick and
light. At low speed, beat in the oil and pumpkin; blend well.
Gradually stir in the flour mixture until well blended.

Divide among the 8 canning jars (should be slightly less than 1/2
full. Wipe the sides of the jar off (inside/ outside) in case you
slop or it'll burn. Place jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll tip
over.

Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until a pick inserted into the center of
each jar comes out clean.
Have your lids and rings ready. Take one jar at a time from the oven;
place a lid and ring on and screw down tightly. Use HEAVY-DUTY
mitts--the jars are HOT! Place the jars onto your counter top too
cool. You'll know when they've sealed, you'll hear a "plinking sound".

Pumpkin Spiced Cake #2

cakes

8 tablespoon butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar
2 1/2 cup sifted cake flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2  eggs
1/3 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 teaspoon ground allspice
1/3 teaspoon ground ginger
1 3/4 cup pumpkin puree
2/3 cup pecans, finely chopped
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon confectioners sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Cream the butter and brown sugar together until light and fluffy. Add

ginger together twice. Add the sifted flour and spices to the egg
mixture, then add the buttermilk and mix well. Add the pureed pumpkin
and the chopped pecans and blend thoroughly, scraping the sides and
bottom of the bowl to ensure proper mixing.  Divide the batter
equally between two buttered and floured layer-cake pans and bake in
a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 25 minutes, or until a
tester inserted through the center comes out clean. Cool the layers
for 10 minutes. Remove them from the pans and place them in the
refrigerator for 45 minutes, or until cold. Whip the cream, vanilla
extract and confectioners sugar together until peaks form. Place
first layer of cake on cake platter, cover with half of the whipped
cream. Place other cake layer on top and finish frosting cake with
remaining whipped cream. Submitted By RHOMMEL <RHOMMEL@IX.NETCOM.COM>

Raspberry Angel Food

cakes

1  angelfood cake
1  raspberries
1  raspberry juice

Contributed to the echo by: Lisa Zech Raspberry Angel Food First you
will need to buy angel food cake! Then buy some rasberrys that are in
the process of jucieness. Put them on a straight plate with no curves
at the side. Mash them down. After you mash them down, put them on
the cake. Then buy some rasberry juice. You put that in a bowl. Then
you get whole berries and put them in the juice. Stir around, but try
not to kill the rasberries (all of them.) Then put that on the cake
and put all the types of fruit you want!

Raspberry Meringue Cake

cakes, deserts

1 1/8 cup flour
1  slightly more than 1/2 cup
1  butter
1 tablespoon sugar
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 oz cocoa

Mix flour and softened butter, sugar, salt and chocolate with a wooden
spoon in a large bowl.  Lay in and 8 inch glass oven dish, covering
the bottom and sides as though it were a pie. (It is very crumbly
because it is so short.) (Meaning short pastry.)  Put in preheat 300F
oven for 15 minutes.  (The cake will be half-cooked when you remove
it.)

Then make the following meringue:

3    egg whites 1 cup sugar
1/2    teaspoon wine vinegar 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 pint fresh
raspberries

With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites, sugar and vinegar for 10
minutes at high speed.  Add vanilla and beat another 5 minutes. Fold
the cleaned raspberries into the meringue. Fill the half-cooked cake
with the meringue and put in oven for another 15 to 20 minutes at
250F.

***The original form of this cake used fresh currants, but as they are
rarely available the Marquesa substituted raspberries.

Dustings on the top of this cake would only add to its presentation. A
dusting of chocolate powder, I think.

"Bursts with sweet, tangy bite of fresh raspberries, although most any
in-season berry will work.  Not too gooey and not too sweet..."

My notes:  Took this to Thxgiving gathering and it went over well.
Very quick and convenient to make, and looks quite presentable.

Raspberry-Cream Cheese Coffee Cake *Jb

cakes, deserts

2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup plus 2 tabl unsalted butter -at roo; m temperature
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 large eggs
8 oz cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup raspberry perserves
1/2 cup sliced almonds

Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour the bottom and sides of a
9-inch springform pan.

In a large bowl, combine the flour and 3/4 cup of the sugar. Using a
pastry blender or fork, cut in the batter until the mixture resembles
coarse crumbs. Reserve 1 cup and set aside.

To the remaining crumb mixture, add the baking powder, soda, salt,
sour cream, almond extract and 1 egg. Blend well. With oiled hands,
gently pat the dough over the bottom and 1 1/2 inches up the sides of
the springform pan; the mixture will be a little sticky.

In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese, the remaining 1/4 cup
sugar, and 1 egg.  Blend well.  Pour into the batter-lined pan. In a
small saucepan, warm the preserves. Carefully spoon the preserves
evenly over the cream cheese mixture.  Stir the  sliced almonds into
the reserved crumb mixture and sprinkle over the preserves. Bake for
45 to 55 minutes, or until the cream cheese filling is set and the
crust is deep golden brown. Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, then
remove from the pan. The cake can be served warm or cool, but it
should be stored in the refrigerator.

1  orange (peel only)
1/2 lb sweet butter
6  eggs; room temperature
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup fine semolina
3 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup finely chopped almonds *
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon brandy

*Note: Use blanched, peeled almonds. Combine 1-1/2 cups of the sugar
with the cold water in a saucepan and cook until dissolved, then add
the cinnamon stick, cloves, and orange peel and simmer for 15
minutes. Remove the flavorings.  Cool. Using an electric mixer, beat
the butter in a large bowl until fluffy. Gradually add the remaining
sugar, beating on medium speed, then add the eggs, one at a time,
beating thoroughly after each addition, without rushing. Meanwhile,
sift the flour, semolina, baking powder, and almonds together.  Very
gradually add to the batter, beating on medium speed, then pour in
the vanilla and brandy and give the batter a last whirl on high speed
for a few seconds. Pour immediately into a buttered 9 x 12 x 3-inch
cake pan and bake on the center rack of a moderate oven (350 F) for
30 to 35 minutes, or until the cake springs back when touched by a
finger. Remove from the oven and set the pan on a cake rack. Using a
sharp knife, score the cake into diamond shapes. Spoon the cooled
syrup over the entire cake and cool. Note: Each piece may be
attractively garnished with a candied or marachino cherry slice in
the center and almond slivers angled on each side.

Robb's Yellow Cake With Caramel Icing

cakes, deserts

      ----FOR THE CAKE LAYERS----
3 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon double-acting baking powder
2  sticks unsalted butter, soft
2 cup granulated sugar
4  eggs, large
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
      ----FOR THE ICING----
10 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown
1  sugar
1/4 cup plus
2 tablespoon milk
1 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 cup sifted confectioners' sugar

Make the cake layers:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2
buttered 9-inch round cake pans with rounds of wax paper, butter the
paper, and dust the pans with flour, knocking out the excess. Onto a
sheet of wax paper sift twice the flour and the baking powder. In a
bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter with the sugar until the
mixture is light and fluffy and beat in the egg yolks, 1 at a time,
beating well after each addition.  Add the flour mixture to the
butter mixture in batches alternately with the milk, beginning and
ending with the flour mixture, and beat in the vanilla.  In another
bowl beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they just hold
stiff peaks, stir one third of them into the batter to lighten it,
and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly.  Divide the
batter between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops, and bake the
layers in the middle of the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a
tester comes out clean. Let the cake layers cool in the pans on racks
for 10 minutes and turn them out onto the racks. Discard the wax
paper and let the layers cool completely.
Make the icing:  In a small saucepan melt the butter over moderate
heat, add the brown sugar, and bring the mixture to a boil. Add the
milk in a stream, whisking, and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove
the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool completely. In the
bowl of an electric mixer beat together the brown sugar mixture and
the vanilla. Add the confectioners' sugar in batches, beating, and
beat the icing until it is light and fluffy.
Assemble the cake:  On a cake plate arrange 1 of the cake layers,
spread the layer with one third of the icing, and top the icing with
the remaining layer. Spread the top and side of the cake with the
remaining icing.

Royal Hawaiian Wedding Cake

cakes, deserts, hawaiian

1 1/2 pkg butter recipe cake mix
1/3 cup light rum
6 oz instant vanilla pudding
1 1/2 cup water
4 each jumbo eggs
1/4 cup salad oil
      ----FROSTING----
6 oz crushed pineapple w/juice
4 oz instant vanilla pudding
1/3 cup light rum
2 pint whipping cream; whipped
1  coconut; for garnish

Mix all cake ingredients for cake and divide into (3) 8 or 9 inch
greased and floured cake pans and bake at temperature listed on the
box. Divide each layer into 2 layers-so you end up with 6 layers
total. Soak the pineapple with the rum for about 30 minutes. Mix in
pudding and let sit until in a gelled state. Whip the two pints of
heavy whipping cream, (put metal mixing bowl in freezer along with
beaters before whipping for best results-I also put pints into
freezer for several minutes before whipping too.) Whip cream until
firm-watch it so it doesn't become butter-that's going too far! Then
fold in the pudding mixture into the whipped cream-carefully. Toast
the coconut in oven til lightly browned. Alternate layers of cake
with layers of thick whipped cream. Garnish with toasted coconut and
cover with plastic wrap tightly and place in refrigerator until the
next day. I have found that if you do not wait and let these flavors
meld for atleast 8 hours, you end up taking a bite of cake and
frosting that has pieces of pineapple loaded with rum and just
doesn't taste good

non-metallic measuring cup. 9. Heat corn syrup, uncovered, in
Microwave Oven 2 minutes or until corn syrup comes to a boil. 10.
Gradually pour boiling mixture over egg whites, beating constantly
until frosting is cool and very stiff. Beat in vanilla. 11. Pour rum
over the tops of both cake layers. 12. Spread apricot preserves over
one of the cooled layers. Then spread some of the frosting on it. 13.
Place second layer on top of first layer and spread entire cake with
frosting. TIPS: Frosting will be neater if you place strips of wax
paper under the bottom edges of the cake before frosting the sides.
Remember to gently remove wax paper before serving cake. Any leftover
frosting can be used on cupcakes or stored in refrigerator for later
use.

Ice with desired icing and fill with Mocha whipped cream.

Now, where's the Mocha Whipped Cream?  Checking the index. Whoops,
sorry, they didn't put that one in!

I'll bet a little powdered instant coffee, cocoa and sugar beaten
into some whipped cream would do the trick.

I'm looking forward to those recipes you get from your mom! Sure hope
you're planning on sharing them here. <grin> The typing practice will
do you good. Help you when you're ready to type up those term papers.

Scotch Black Bun

cakes, fruits, christmas, gifts

3/4 lb unsalted butter; chilled, *
3 3/4 cup unbleached flour; plus
3 1/3 cup unbleached flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoon ice water; may use up to 10
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon mace
1/8 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon black pepper; freshly ground
3 cup seedless raisins
3 cup white or golden raisins
1/2 cup almonds; ground
1 1/2 cup almonds; coarsely chopped
3  eggs; lg
1/2 cup buttermilk or milk
1 cup brandy
1  egg; lg, beaten

*    The butter, 3 sticks, should be cut into small pieces.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the butter, 3 3/4 c flour, and
1/4 ts of salt.  With your fingers, work the ingredients together
until you form small granules that are fairly uniform in size.
Sprinkle 8 tb of the ice water over the granules and continue mixing
until you can gather the ingredients into a ball. If the dough
crumbles, add additional ice water, 1 tb at a time, until a soft ball
can be formed. With the flat of your hand, press the dough into a
thick cake, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1
hour.  Prepare the filling by sifting the 3 1/2 cups of flour, the
sugar, baking powder, spices, and remaining 1/4 ts of salt into a
large bowl. Add the freshly ground black pepper, seedless and white
or golden raisins, ground and coarsely chopped almonds. Mix
thoroughly until all the fruits and nuts are coated well with the dry
ingredients. Add the 3 eggs, milk, and brandy mixing well. Preheat
the oven to 375 degrees F. and, on a lightly floured surface, roll
two-thirds of the chilled pastry to a thickness of 1/4-inch.  Gently
place a 9 X 3 1/2-inch springform pan on the pastry. With a small
sharp knife,cut along the outside of the pan to make a disk.  Line
the bottom of the pan with the disk of pastry. Use the remaining
pieces of rolled-out pasty to line the sides of the pan, slightly
overlapping the pastry on the bottom and letting the pastry extend
about 1/2-inch above the top of the form. Spoon the filling into the
pan, packing it down firmly and press the excess pastry over the
filling. Brush the pastry with a little of the beaten egg. In the
same fashion, roll out the remaining pastry into a circle larger than
the form. Roll the pastry around the rolling pin to lift it and
unroll it on the top of the form. Press the top pastry against the
filling and the pastry below to make a tight seal and trim off the
excess. Brush the entire top with the beaten egg. Cut a 1-inch round
vent in the middle of the bun, and if you like, use the pastry scraps
to make leaves. Roll the scraps together and cut out tear drop shapes
to resemble leaves. Score the top, with a small sharp knife, to
resemble the ribs of the leaves. Brush the undersides of the leaves
with the remaining beaten egg to make them adhere to the top of the
bun. Then brush the top again with the beaten egg. Bake on a rack in
the middle of the oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the pastry is a
rich golden brown. If the decorations color much faster than the top
sheath of pasty, cover them with aluminum foil to reflect the oven
heat and retard the browning.

Seafood Pancakes

appetizers, cakes, breakfast, seafood, pancakes

1 cup flour
1  pinch salt
1  egg, lightly beaten
4 teaspoon oil
1 1/2 cup milk plus 1 tbsp
1/2 lb monkfish
6  scallops
3/4 cup milk
2  garlic cloves, chopped
1/2 lb shrimp, shelled
2 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon flour
1/4 cup light cream
1 cup gruyere cheese
2 tablespoon parsley, fresh, chopped
1  salt and pepper
1 1/2 tablespoon oil for frying

Servings: 10

Make pancake batter by mixing flour and salt in mixing bowl. Make
well in center and pour in the egg, 4 tsp oil and 1 cup milk. Whisk
to smooth batter then add remaining milk.

Remove any skin from monkfish, rinse and cut into bite-size pieces.
Pat dry. Rinse and pat dry scallops, cut in half. Pour 3/4 cup milk
into saucepan, add garlic and bring to simmer.  Add all fish except
shrimp. Simmer for 5-6 minutes then add shrimp. When shrimp turn pink
remove all fish to a bowl and set aside. Strain fish milk and reserve
for sauce. Place butter in saucepan and melt, add flour and stir for
2 minutes, then pour in reserved milk and the cream. Continue to stir
and simmer for a few minutes until you have a smooth sauce. Turn heat
to low, add cheese and parsley and season to taste with salt and
pepper. Add fish, mix well.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Place small frying pan or omelet pan over high heat. Lightly grease
it with a little oil. Beat pancake batter, then pour 3 Tbsp into pan.
Turn pan so bottom is covered evenly with batter and cook for 40-60
seconds, turn and cook 30-40 seconds longer. Transfer to large plate.
Continue with remaining batter. (There should be enough filling for
10 pancakes.) Place an equal amount of filling (about 3 Tbsp) in
center of each pancake, fold the sides over filling and arrange in
ovenproof dish just large enough to hold pancakes. Place in oven for
20 minutes, or until the pancakes are hot through.  Serve immediately.

These thin pancakes, which conceal a tasty mixture of fish, will
appeal to the masked and mysterious side of the Cancerian, who when
in need of refreshment and quiet will reture into his or her own
protective shell. These can be served as a first course or as a
luncheon dish for four, with a green salad and a very chilled white
wine.

Seven-Up Pound Cake

cakes

1 cup regular margarine
1/2 cup shortening
3 cup sugar
5 large eggs
3 cup unbleached flour (cake
1  flour was not specified)
2 tablespoon lemon extract
1 cup 7-up (room temperature)

This is an old recipe that comes from a request in the local paper for
"Classic Recipes".  They called the 7-Up bottling company and they
did not even know about it. Someone developed this on their own and
never let the company know about it.  BTW 7-Up comes from the popular
card game in the 1930's.

Cream the margarine, shortening and sugar together beating until
light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, blending well after
each addition. Beat in the flour, then beat in the extract and 7-Up.
Blend well. Pour the batter into a well-greased and floured tube pan
and bake at 325 degrees F for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

1/2  to 1 cup packed brown sugar
1  remove from the pan and add:
1  (1 cup pecan meats) * optional, i o; mitted this *
1  place over the butter and sugar mix; ture:
1  slices or halves of canned drained; fruit: no. 2 1/2 can
1  * i put half marachino cherries, cu; rved side down, in the
1  spaces *
1  cover the fruit with the following; batter.  sift together:
1 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon double-acting baking powder
1  beat in a separate bowl:
4  egg yolks
1  add:
1 tablespoon melted butter * i used oil *
1 teaspoon vanilla
1  sift in separate bowl:
1 cup sugar
1  whip until stiff, but not dry:
4  egg whites

A Heavy 9 or 10 inch skillet * I used a 9 inch cake pan and melted the
butter in the oven *

Vary this recipe, which conventionally calls for canned pineapple, by
using canned or frozen raspberries, peaches, or apricots. The last
two require only 1/2 cup of sugar. Fresh fruit - peaches, cherries,
apples, etc. - may require more than 1 cup, depending on the acidity
of the fruit.

Preheat the oven to 350. Melt in a skillet: Fold in the sugar, 1
tablespoon at a time; then fold in the yolk mixture, and finally the
sifted flour, 1/4 cup at a time. Bake the cake about 30 minutes.
Immediately upon removal from the oven, reverse the cake on a serving
plate. Allow the cake to remain over the cake to let the brown sugar
mixture coat the cake. Remove the pan and serve upside down, after
sprinkling the fruit with: (Brandy or rum) * I didn't do this, but
yum yum yum! * The cake may be garnished with: (Whipped cream or a
dessert sauce) *Good Heavens, why? * For individual servings, try
this method:  Put butter, sugar and fruit in base of custard cups,
run batter given above on

Sour Cream Coffee Cake

cakes

1/2 cup shortening
3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 large eggs
2 cup flour, sifted
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 pint sour cream
6 tablespoon butter, softened
1 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup nuts, chopped (walnuts or pecans)

Prepare a 10-inch tube pan.  I use one with a removable center. Grease the
pan and cut a circle of waxed paper to cover the bottom. Preheat oven to
350    degrees.

Cream shortening, sugar and vanilla, thoroughly.  Add eggs, singly, beating
well after each addition.

Sift flour, baking powder and baking soda together.  Add flour mixture and
sour cream to creamed mixture.  Alternate a little of each, blending after
each addition.

In separate bowl, cream butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together. Add nuts
and mix well.

Spread 1/2 of the batter in the tube pan.  Sprinkle 1/2 of the nut mixture
evenly over batter in pan.  Cover with remaining batter. Sprinkle with
remaining nut mixture.  Bake in preheated oven for about 50 minutes.

When the cake cools, run a knife around the side of the pan and remove the
inner section.  Carefully remove the cake from the base of the pan and
remove the waxed paper.

NOTES:

*  Coffee cake with cinnamon and sour cream -- I got this recipe from my
mom. She got it, I think, from my godmother. All of us kids in the family
make it now. It is an unusual coffee cake, good to have with morning coffee
or as an evening dessert. Enjoy it. Yield: Fills 10-inch tube pan.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  45 minutes preparation, 50 minutes baking, 10 minutes cooling.

Spiced Honey Cake (Appenzell)

cakes, swiss

200 gm liquid honey
200 gm sugar
500 gm wholemeal flour
20 gm butter
1 deciliter milk
1  egg
15 gm baking powder
10 gm ground cloves
10 gm nutmeg
10 gm cardamon
1 pinch cinnamon
1  icing for decoration

(Units: 100 g = 3 1/2 oz; 1 dl = 3 1/2 fl oz = 2/5 cup; 180 oC = 350
oF; 200 oC = 400 oF; 230 oC = 450 oF; 250 oC = 475 oF; 2.5 cm = 1
inch)

The Story:

The rural origins of Appenzell cookery are evident even in this
substantial honey cake. It is very fashionable during the festivities
at the end of the year to serve a spiced honey cake following the
example of the famous triangular "Biberli", which also blends honey
and spices. This recipe is inspired by the "Bacheschnitte" which are
served on the "Funkensonntag", a spring festival held to exorcise all
the evil spirits of winter by fire.

The recipe:

Spiced Pecan Cake

cakes

2 cup coarsely chopped pecans
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup unsalted butter
2 teaspoon plus 2 tsp vanilla extract
2 cup sugar
3 cup sifted all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup plus 2 tbsp milk
3  egg whites

Grease and flour three 8" round cake pans (1 1/2" deep). Place the
pecans in a large ungreased roasting pan. Roast nuts @ 425 degrees
for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Watch, carefully, lower heat,
if necessary. Meanwhile, in a medium size bowl, combine brown sugar,
cinnamon and nutmeg. Then, mix in 4 tbsp of butter. Add 2 cups
roasted pecans to the butter mixture. Coat them thoroughly. Return
mixture to the pan and roast for 10 minutes more, stirring once or
twice. Stir in 2 tbsp vanilla extract and roast 5 minutes more.
Remove from oven and set aside. In a large bowl of an electric mixer,
cream 3/4 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar on high speed until very
light and fluffy, about 6 to 8 minutes. In a separate bowl, sift
together flour and baking powder. In a third bowl, combine milk and
remaining 2 tsp vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and the milk
mixture, alternately, to the butter, beating on high speed until well
blended and scraping the bowl sides between additions. Stir in the
pecans. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites on high speed until
frothy, about 30 seconds. Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue
beating until mixture holds peaks, about 2 minutes. Gently, fold egg
white mixture into the batter, one third at a time. Spoon batter into
prepared cake pans and spread batter so that it is slightly lower in
the center. Bake @ 350 degrees until a toothpick inserted near the
center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool 1 minute, then
carefully remove from the pans and place on a wire rack. Cool
thoroughly. Glaze. Spread generously with frosting between layers and
on top and sides.

Spiced Pecan Cake Frosting

cakes, toppings

1 1/2 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup water
8  egg yolks
1 1/2 cup margarine, softened
2 1/2 cup powdered sugar
4 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cup pecans; coarsely chopped

Use margarine rather than butter in this frosting because butter
tends to melt out of the frosting as the cake sits awhile. Roast
pecans until dark, then cool. Combine the granulated sugar and water
in a 1 quart saucepan. Cook over medium heat to soft thread stage
(230 degrees on a candy thermometer), about 15 minutes. Do not Stir.
In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg yolks on high speed
just slightly, about 5 seconds. Gradually, add the hot sugar water
mixture. Beat until thoroughly cool, thick, shiny and very pale,
about 10 minutes. Start at low speed so it won't splash; then go to
high speed. If crystal sugar builds up around the sides of the bowl,
don't scrape it into the mixture, it will make the frosting lumpy and
you will have plenty of frosting without it. Gradually, add the
margarine and mix on medium speed until completely blended and very
smooth, about 5 minutes. Blend in the powdered sugar and vanilla
extract on low speed until smooth, then, add the pecans. Beat on high
speed until thoroughly mixed and very thick. If frosting is too
thick, thin with a little cream, milk or water.

Spiced Pound Cake With Lemon Basil-Orange Syr

cakes

      ----CAKE----
3/4 lb unsalted butter; room temp
1 lb powdered sugar
6 large eggs; lightly beaten
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 3/4 cup all-purpose flour; sifted
1 tablespoon nutmeg
      ----LEMON BASILORANGE SYRUP----
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup water
2 cup sugar
1 cup lemon basil leaves, fresh; minced

"Dense and moist, this lightly spiced pound cake makes a lovely
warm-weather dessert; the Lemon Basil-Orange syrup is the perfect
flavor companion for this buttery cake. This recipe makes two cakes;
if you can only use one at a time I suggest freezing the second cake,
wrapped tightly in plastic and then in foil. However, once the cakes
are drizzled with the syrup they will keep at cool room temperature
for up to one week."

To make the cake:

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Grease two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans
and dust lightly with flour.

In a large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until creamy.
Gradually sift the powdered sugar into the butter, stirring
occasionally to partially combine. When all the sugar has been added,
beat until fluffy. Gradually add the eggs, beating well after each
addition. Add the vanilla, flour, and nutmeg; mix well. Divide the
batter between the two pans.

Bake on the bottom rack of oven for 45 minutes. Rotate the pans to
the top rack and bake for 10 minutes longer or until a toothpick
inserted into the centers of the cakes comes out clean.

Remove from the oven and cool in pans for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Lemon Basil-Orange Syrup:

Place the orange juice, water, sugar, and basil in a deep-sided
saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 15 minutes,
stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from boiling over. When
the mixture is thick and syrupy, remove from the heat and strain.
Cool to room temperature. If the syrup becomes thicker than pouring
consistency, thin with about 2 tablespoons of very hot water.

Using a long, thin, wooden skewer, poke each cake all over from the
top to the bottom. Drizzle half of the syrup over each cake, taking
care to spread the syrup evenly into the tiny holes. Let cakes stand
at least 2 hours before serving or cover with foil and keep up to 1
week in the pan. To serve, remove the room-temperature cakes from
pans and cut into 1-inch slices. Garnish with sprigs of basil.

Spicy Baked Syrup Cakes

cakes, deserts

1 1/2 cup honey
1 1/2 cup sugar; granulated water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 lb walnuts; finely chopped
1 1/4 cup butter; softened
4 teaspoon cinnamon; ground (or more)
1 1/2 cup oil; vegetable
1/2 cup sugar; icing
2  oranges' strained juice
2 tablespoon cognac or brandy
1/4 teaspoon cloves; ground
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg; ground
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
6 cup flour; all purpose (or more
2 oz walnuts; finely chopped

(Author's Note): Ancient and traditional small, spicy baked syruped
cakes, these are perfect for a large buffet. The nickname asserts
their introduction into Greece by the Phoenicians, but not with these
ingredients!  Within my lifetime I have seen the oil give way to
butter and semolina succumb to flour. Combine the honey, granulated
sugar, water, and lemon juice in a saucepan and boil for 5 minutes.
Remove from the heat. Combine the 1 pound finely chopped walnuts with
1/4 cup of the softened butter, 2 teaspoons of the cinnamon, and 5
tablespoons of the syrup. Reserve the remaining syrup and set the
filling aside while you prepare the dough. Using an electric mixer,
cream the remaining butter (1 cup) with the oil until light and
fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar, beating on medium
speed.  Add the orange juice slowly to the batter, along with the
Cognac or brandy, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and the other spices.
In a small bowl, sift the baking powder, soda, and 2 cups of the
flour together. Slowly add the flour mixture to the batter and beat
for a few minutes. Continuing to mix by hand, add only enough
remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Knead. Break off small pieces
of the dough and shape with your fingers into oblongs about
2-1/2-inches long and 1-inch high. Flatten between your palms and
place 1 teaspoon of the filling mixture in the center.  Work the
dough around the filling to enclose it completely and press firmly to
seal. This procedure sounds difficult, but with many hands it is
quite simple. Place on a cookie sheet and continue until all the
cakes are shaped.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes,
then cool on a rack.  Bring the syrup back to a boil. Dip each cake
into the syrup and arrange on a platter. Sprinkle with the remaining
chopped walnuts and teaspoon cinnamon, or more if desired. Cool
before storing.

Note: You may bake and cool melomakarona, store a few days in advance
and dip in syrup as described above a day or so before serving. The
flavor improves after a few days.

Springtime Cake

cakes

1 pint strawberries, hulled
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 cup sugar
1  red food coloring (op.)
2 tablespoon cointreau
3 cup icing sugar
1/3 cup soft butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup red currant jelly
1  french sponge layers,
1  recipe follows
1  orange butter cream,
1  recipe follows
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pistachio
1  nuts
1 pint perfect whole strawberries,
1  hulled

Wash and cut up l pint hulled strawberries into a flat dish. Mash
with a fork until well broken up. You should have about l cup mashed
strawberries. Set aside 1/4 cup and bring rest to a boil in a small
saucepan. Thoroughly combine cornstarch and 1/4 cup sugar and
gradually stir into boiling berries. Stir just until clear and
slightly thickened, then remove from heat. Add a little red food
coloring if desired. Stir in half the Cointreau and let stand at room
temperature until needed for filling. Combine icing sugar, butter,
vanilla and enough of the 1/4 cup strawberry pure to make an icing
that is easy to spread. Beat until fluffy and set aside. Heat red
currant jelly and remaining Cointreau over lowest heat until jelly
melts. Keep just barely warm until needed. Split cake layers to make
4 thin layers. Put first layer on a serving plate. Spread with half
of Orange Butter Cream. Top with second layer and spread with
strawberry filling. Top with third layer and spread with remaining
butter cream. Top with last layer. Chill for about l0 min. if butter
cream seems very soft. Set aside about 1/2 cup strawberry icing and
thinly ice sides of cake with part of remainder. Press pistachios
into icing. Turn a 5-inch plate or saucer upside down in centre of
top layer and ice all around it with rest of strawberry icing. This
will make a nice, even iced edge about 2 inches wide. Lift plate or
saucer with tip of knife and remove. Fill un-iced centre of the cake
with the whole strawberries. Spoon some of the melted currant jelly
over each berry, letting it run down to cover the berry and fill the
spaces around it. Put the 1/2 cup icing in a decorating bag or tube
with a rosette tip and pipe small rosettes all around strawberry
centre to cover joint between icing and glazed berries. Chill until
shortly before serving time.Serves 12.

Stained-Glass Cake

cakes

1 cup plain flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 lb glace pineapple
2 oz glace pear
2 oz glace kiwi fruit
2 oz glace apple
2 oz glace apricot
4 oz glace cherries
4 oz sultanas
4 oz currants
2  eggs
1/3 cup brown sugar
4 oz halved blanched almonds
4 oz halved pecan nuts
4 oz halved macadamia ants
4 oz halved brazil nuts
1/4 cup grand marnier or cointreau.

From the traditional to the (comparatively) new-fangled. Stained
glass or bishopcakes, very popular in the UK, are so called, one
presumes, because they consist almost entirely of glace fruit and
nuts, and the glace fruit has something of the translucency of a
stained-glass church window.

Butter  a large cake tin. Line with waxed paper. Butter the paper.
Chop the glace fruits roughly.  Sift together the flour and baking
powder.

Mix in all the fruits,  together with the nuts. Put the mixture into
the cake tin, wet hands  and press mixture down firmly.

Bake in a preheated 300F  degree oven for 1 1/2 hours. Take cake out
of the oven and drizzle the Grand Marnier or Cointreau over the top.
Leave the cake in the oven to cool until warm, then wrap it, tin and
all, in aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight.

Remove from tin, peel away paper and store in airtight tin.

      ----BROWNIED CAKE MIX----
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon -- opt.

1 tablespoon dried buttermilk
1 tablespoon dried eggs (scrambled egg

1/2 tablespoon vanilla sugar
1/4 cup walnuts -- finely chopped

the contents of the smaller pot inside. Both pots need lids or covers
of heavy duty alumimum foil.

Mix the cake ingredients ahead of time  cutting the margarine into
the dry ingredients, and pack in a zip lock bag. Use large enough bag
that it can be used as the mixing container.

Grease the bottom and side of the smaller pot.  Add the water to the
mix and beat by hand till smooth. Stir in nuts. Pour mixture into the
prepared pot. Cover the pot. Put thesmaller pot inside the larger one
and pour hot water up the side about 2/3 or 3/4 of the way up the
side of the inside pot.  Put the lid on and set level on the edge of
the fire so the water simmers and barely boils. Cook for 2 1/2 to 3
hours or till cakes spring back when touched and a long wooden
tooth-pick inserted near the centers comes out clean.

Steamed Cherry Pound Cake

cakes, deserts, steamed

1 pkg pound cake mix -- (16 oz) water
2  whole eggs
20  to 30 marachino cherries
1  drained all-purpose flour

Cherry Pound Cake 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours To  Cook: Turn the cake mix,
water, and eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric
beater on low. In a small bowl, combine the maraschino cherries with
the flour. Toss the cherries well in the flour so that all the
moisture on the cherries is absorbed. Pour the batter into a greased
and floured 2-quart mold or spring-form pan, Drop the cherries into
the batter from high enough up so they sink into it. (This maneuver
keeps all the cherries, which are heavier than the batter, from
sinking to the bottom of the cake.) Place the pan in the slow cooker
and cover with a loosely fitting plate. Cover the pot, but prop the
lid open a fraction with a toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess
steam escape. Cook on High for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. When a toothpick
inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, the cake is done.
Cool the cake on a rack for 10 to 15 minutes before you turn it out
of the pan. Let it cool thoroughly before serving. Makes 10 to 12
servings. "Clear & Simple Crockery Cooking", by Jacqueline Heriteau

Steamed Rice Coconut Milk Cake

cakes

1 lb rice flour
3 cup granulated sugar
3 cup coconut milk
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon water
1  wine rice ball, crushed to a powder

Combine 3 tablespoons of the rice flour, 1/4 cup of the coconut milk,
and 1/2 teaspoon of yeast with the wine rice ball. Cover and allow to
stand at room temperature for three hours.

Cook 2 1/2 cups of the coconut milk with the sugar just long enough
to melt the sugar.  Remove from the heat and cool.

After the yeast-rice flour mixture has rested for three hours,
combine it with the coconut milk-sugar mixture. Mix well, cover, and
allow to rest at room temperature for another 3 hours. At the end of
the resting time, combine the mixture with the remaining coconut
milk, lemon juice, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of yeast, which
should first be dissolved in the teaspoon of water.  Transfer to
several small bowls or pans so that the mixture fills it only halfway
to allow room for expansion. Let stand overnight, at room
temperature. The following day, steam [using the wet steaming method
as described on page 36] for 30 minutes.

Serve the cake either hot, cold, or at room temperature.

Note: A wine rice ball can be purchased in Oriental grocery stores.
They are about the size of a camphor ball, and white. To crush, use a
rolling pin or a blender.

Steaming

A steamer consists of a pot in which water is boiled and at least two
more metal inserts or layers that fit directly on the lower pot of
water, one above the other. These inserts are perforated, allowing
wet steam to circulate freely through the layers and enabling either
a large quantity of one food or several different foods to be cooked
at the same time.

Strawberry Cake Lee Bailey

cakes, fruits

3 cup strawberries, hulled and hal
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon butter; melted
4  eggs, yolks and whites separ
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup flour, sifted
1 pinch strawberry preserves, refrig

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Butter a 8 or 9 inch springform pan. Put
the berries in the springform pan, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup of
sugar. Put aside.  Beat the melted butter with the egg yolks. In a
separate bowl beat the egg whites, add salt and cram of tartar. Beat
the egg whites until stiff, and then fold in the remaining sugar (1
cup). Add the flour 1/4 at a time , alternating with the egg yolk
mixture. Pour the cake mixture over the berries and bake for 1 hour
(or 1 hr. 10 minutes ) at 325 degrees. REmove from spring form pan.
Spoon juice over the cake, add the preserves and whipping cream as a
topping.

From Lee Bailey. This is an old southern dish that was also common in
the Maritimes. It is a cooked short cake for strawberries. Really, by
cooked they mean that the strawberries are cooked in the oven. I
consider that the preserves in the whipping cream is superfluous. AML

Strawberry Meringue Cake

cakes, deserts, fruits/nuts

      ----GENOISE LAYER----
4 large eggs
1 pinch salt
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup cake flour
3 tablespoon cornstarch
      ----LEMON KIRSCH SYRUP----
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoon kirsch
      ----STRAWBERRY FILLING----
2 pint strawberries
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon kirsch
2 tablespoon cornstarch
      ----COVERING MERINGUE----
6 large egg whites
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup toasted, sliced almonds

GENOISE LAYER: Preheat oven to 350F. Break eggs into bowl of electric
mixer. Whisk in salt, then sugar. Place bowl over pan of simmering
water. Whisk until just lukewarm. Whip by machine until cold and
increased in volume, about 4-5 minutes. Mix cake flour and
cornstarch. Sift over the egg foam in 3 or 4 additions, folding in
with a rubber spatula. Pour batter into buttered and paper-lined
10-inch round pan and level. Bake about 30 minutes until well-risen,
golden and beginning to shrink from sides. Unmold immediately and
cool on a rack. Divide the cooled Genoise into 3 layers with a sharp,
serrated knife. Place 1 layer on a cardboard or platter and moisten
with 1/3 of the syrup, using a brush. Spread with 1/2 the filling.
Repeat with the second layer. Place the last layer on and moisten
with the remaining syrup. LEMON KIRSCH SYRUP: For the syrup, combine
water and sugar in a small pan, bring to a boil and cool. Stir in
lemon juice and kirsch. STRAWBERRY FILLING: For the filling, reserve
6 of the best strawberries as a decoration. Rinse, hull and slice the
remaining berries. Place 1/4 of the berries in a saucepan with the
sugar and bring to a boil. Combine lemon juice, kirsch and corn-
starch and stir into the strawberry mixture off the heat. Return to a
boil, stirring and cook 2 minutes. Remove from heat, cool and stir in
remaining sliced berries. COVERING MERINGUE: Preheat oven to 400F and
set rack in the middle level. Combine egg whites and sugar in bowl of
an electric mixer. Whisk over simmering water until egg whites are
hot and sugar is dissolved. Beat on medium speed until cold and risen
in volume, but not dry. Spread cake with meringue. Pipe decoration on
top of cake, using a pastry bag fitted with a star tube. Press
toasted, sliced almonds against the side of the cake. Place the cake
on a cookie sheet and color the meringue in the oven for about 3-4
minutes. Remove the cake from the oven and cool. Decorate with the
reserved strawberries.

Strawberry Shortcake

cakes, fruits

3/4 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup unbleached white flour
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup plus 3t brown sugar (packed)
2 tablespoon butter, melted
3/4 cup low-fat milk
1 pint strawberries     *

* Sweet, ripe strawberries, hulled and crushed Heavy Cream (optional)

Preheat oven to 400 deg F.
In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt.
In another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the sugar with the melted butter
until it dissolves. Stir in the milk, then combine the wet with the
dry ingredients and work together to form a soft dough. Turn the
dough out onto a well-floured board and knead for a minute or so.
Divide the dough into 2 equal parts, form into smooth balls, and roll
out to to fit the bottom of a pie pan. Place the rounds of dough in 2
lightly oiled pie pans. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until dough is
golden brown.
In the meantime, combine the crushed strawberries with the remaining
3 T sugar in a small bowl. Cover until ready to use.
Allow the baked dough to cool until it is just warm to the touch.
Place 1 round on a serving plate, spread it with the berries, and top
with the other round of dough. Cut into wedges to serve; this is best
served fresh and warm. Top each serving with a bit of cold, stiffly
beaten heavy cream if you'd like.

Streusel Plum Cake

cakes

2 tablespoon margarine
6 tablespoon granulated sugar
1  egg, separated
3/4 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup 2% milk
1 cup halved plums or other fruit
1  streusel topping
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon soft margarine
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1  glaze (optional)
2 tablespoon icing sugar
1/2 teaspoon 2% milk
1/8 teaspoon vanilla

Grease 8" square cake pan, 9" pie plate or springform pan.

Beat egg white in a small bowl and set aside.  In large bowl, cream
together margarine, sugar and egg yolk until fluffy. Combine flour and
baking powder, beat into egg mixture alternately with milk. Fold
beaten egg white into batter.

Turn into prepared pan.  Halve plums (or slice peach, apple, pear,
nectarine) and arrange over top.

Streusel topping:  in a small bowl, combine brown sugar, margarine and
cinnamon.  Mix well and sprinkle over fruit.

Bake at 350 F for about 35 minutes or until top is golden and
toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean. Time depends on
thickness of batter.

Glaze:  Combine icing sugar, milk and vanilla.  Mix well. Drizzle over
cake.

My notes:  original recipe halved makes 5 servings, but it tasted so
good warm that we only cut 4 servings. Warmed up in microwave for the
second meal. Use extra fruit (fresh or canned) to make 6 servings.
Would be nice served at a brunch - moist but not too sweet. Tested
with fresh nectarines!

Substitute Bisquick #2

cakes

5 cup flour
1/4 cup baking powder
1/2 tablespoon salt
1 cup shortening

Sift dry ingredients together in large bowl.  With two knives, a
pastry blender, or your food processor, cut shortening in in
spoonsful until mixture is texture of course cornmeal. If you are
using a food processor, start and stop often during processing and
watch it closely.

Keep mix stored in labeled, tightly closed container. It will keep on
a pantry shelf 1-6 months in dry weather. In very hot, humid weather,
it's a good idea to keep mix in refrigerator.

Sylvia's comments:  I mixed this up in my Osterizer stand mixer
instead of hand-cutting or using a food processor. I did have to
manually turn it against the way it wanted to go a few times, but
that was it. I used a very low speed.  I have used this substitute in
a biscuit recipe, and it worked fine.

Suffolk Cakes(English)

2 oz butter
2  eggs
4 oz caster sugar
1  finely grated rind of a small lemon
2 oz self-raising flour

Set oven to 400/F or Mark 6. Warm the butter in a saucepan until it
is just liquid. Separate the eggs and whisk the whites until they
stand in soft peaks. Beat the yolks, add the sugar and lemon rind,
then fold in the egg whites. Stir the butter and flour into the egg
mixture and beat well. Divide the mixture evenly between paper bun
cases that have been set in a bun tin (the mixture is somewhat slack,
so placing the paper cases in a bun tin gives them extra support) and
bake for about 15 minutes or until the cakes are golden and springy
to the touch. As the cakes cool, their tops will flatten.

Sugar Free Fluffy Frosting

cakes, low fat, diabetic, low cal

1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon water
2 pkg sweet n low
2  lg eggs
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Combine sugar, water, Sweet N Low, egg whites, and cream of tartar in
top of a double boiler and beat at high speed for 1 minute. Set over
simmering water in the bottom of the double boiler. Continue to beat
at high speed for 4-5 minutes or until soft peaks form.
Remove from heat. Add vanilla to frosting and continue beating at
high speed 1-2 minutes or until thick enough to spread on a cooled
cake. Use about 2 1/2 tablespoons per portion if frosting
individually; or use this amount to frost a 2-layer cake or a 9 inch
square cake, both of which would then be cut into 16 equal servings.
You can change the frosting easily by adding a couple drops of food
coloring and some flavoring, such as 2 drops of red coloring and some
peppermint flavoring. 1 serving = 1 vegetable (1-1 1/2 tablespoons
may be used as a topping for cake or pudding without counting it as
an exchange. calories =

Suksessterte

cakes, deserts

7 oz almonds
7 oz icing/confectioner's
1  sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
5  egg whites
1  egg cream
5  egg yolks
4 3/8 oz sugar
1/2 cup heavy cream
1  (i use 38% butterfat)
1 teaspoon gelatine (heaping)
5 1/3 oz unsalted butter,
1  room temperature (no
1  margarine, please; )
1  vanilla, optional
3 1/2 oz semisweet chocolate
1  (i use freia's
1  dronningsjokolade)
1  brewed coffee,
1  milk or butter

Grind the almonds. Mix almonds, icing/confectioner's sugar and baking
powder. Whip the egg whites until they are stiff. Very carefully mix
the almond-mix with the egg whites ("cut" them in). Bake at 175 C
(350 F) for app. 30 minutes in a round mould. It should be golden in
colour, but not brown around the edges.

Let the cake cool. Cut the cake in half horizontally (or make two).

Egg cream:  Heat egg yolks, sugar and cream over low heat until the
cream thickens. Do not boil. Stir constantly (Do not use a metal
whisk in an aluminium pot - except for Halloween - the egg cream will
turn green).

Put the gelatine in water for a few minutes. Then squeeze out excess
water. Heat in a double boiler until liquid. Mix the gelatine with
the butter. (Add vanilla if you use it). Stir well. Add this mix to
the egg cream, a little at the time.

Put the egg cream between the layers of the cake, save some. In a
double boiler, melt the semisweet chocolate. Put the melted chocolate
on top of the cake, decorate with the remaining egg cream. If the
melted chocolate is difficult to work with, add a _little_ brewed
coffee, milk _or_ butter.

This is a rich cake - it will go a long way!

Swiss Meringue

cakes

5  egg whites @ room temp
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/4 cup sugar

Grease & flour 2 baking sheets.  Combine egg whites, cream of tartar,
salt, & vanilla in a large bowl. Beat (at medium speed if a mixer is
used) until egg whites hold soft peaks. Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar,
a tablespoon at a time, beating continuously. Continue beating until
meringue is very stiff and dull. It has been beaten enough when a
bit, rubbed between thumb & finger, is no longer grainy.  The
meringue should be stiff enough to hold it's shape when formed with a
pastry tube. Gently fold in remaining sugar.

Meringues should actually be dried rather than baked. Herein lies the
secret of making meringues which are tender, delicate, and
light-colored, rather than overly crisp, tough, and too dark to be
either attractive or delicious.  The best meringues are baked by the
following method:

Set oven teperature at 200 degrees before beginning to beat the egg
whites. After shaping the meringue mixture on baking sheets, place in
the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Then turn off the oven heat. Allow
the meringues to remain in the oven with the heat rurned off for at
least 4-5 hours -- the longer the better. If your oven has a pilot
light, the meringues will be ready a little sooner.  The meringues
should be totally dry before removing them from the oven.  If you
can, leave them in the oven overnight.

For many of us, however, time is a factor.  If you can't take the
time to bake meringues this slow, slow way, accept second best &
simply bake them slowly, setting the oven temperature for 200 degrees
or less if possible. At 200 degrees, meringue layers will need to
bake for about 40 minutes; small meringues may take a little less
time.

Whatever method you use, it is important to prevent the meringues from
coloring, since even a light tan color changes their texture and
taste as well as their appearance.

When thoroughly dry, meringues can be kept covered in a dry airy
place (NOT in a tightly covered box) for several weeks.

ALTERNATE MIXING METHOD by ELECTRIC BEATER

Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla
in large bowl.  Beat at high speed until egg whites hold peaks. Add
1/2 cup sugar, all at once. Beat at high speed until mixture is very
stiff and there are no grains of undisolved sugar. Fold in remaining
sugar.

To shape Swiss Meringue into layers and rounds follow directions given
below.

Grease and flour a large baking sheet.  Press the rim of a 9-inch
layer cake pan or a 2-inch cooky cutter lightly into the flour on
baking sheet to make guides. If Baking Pan Liner Paper is used, the
guiding circles will have to be traced with a pencil.  Spread mixture
within circles. OR: Fill a pastry bag fitted with a No.3 or 5 tube
with prepared mixture. Starting in center of each circle, press out
bater in a long, continuous, pencil-thick strip, curling it round &
round until traced circle is completely filled in (spiral).  For best
control, press out batter slowly, holding bag at least 1 inch away
from sheet.

Bake in a 325 degree oven, 25 minutes for small rounds, 35-40 minutes
for 9-inch layers.

Tahini Cake

cakes, deserts

1 tablespoon veg. margarine or peanut oil
1 cup tahini
1 cup caster sugar
1  orange (grated rind only)
3/4 cup strained orange juice
2 1/4 cup plain flour
1 pinch salt
3 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
1/2 cup sultanas (white raisins)

This cake is frequently made during Lent as it contains no animal
products. Peanut butter, the smooth, creamy variety, may be used
instead of tahini.

Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 45-60 minutes

Grease a 20 cm (8 inch) tube pan or a 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 inch) slab
cake pan with melted margarine or oil. Chill in refrigerator until
required. Beat tahini, sugar and orange rind for 10 minutes, then
gradually beat in orange juice.  Sift dry ingredients twice and fold
into tahini mixture. Blend in walnuts and sultanas.

Dust chilled cake pan with flour and turn batter into pan. Spread
evenly and knock base of pan on table top to settle batter. Bake in a
moderate oven for 55-60 minutes for tube pan, 45 minutes or so for
slab cake. When cooked, invert cake in its pan onto cake rack and
leave for 2-3 minutes before lifting pan from cake. Cool cake and cut
in slices or squares to serve. Store cake in a sealed container.

Tarte Tatin D'orleans

cakes, fruits, deserts

      ----CRUST----
2 1/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
10 tablespoon (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, roo; m temp.
6 tablespoon water
10 tablespoon (1 1/4 sticks) chilled unsalted but; ter
      ----FILLING----
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
3/4 cup sugar
12 medium red delicious apples, peeled, quart; ered, cored
1  vanilla ice cream (opt)

FOR CRUST:  Combine flour and salt in large bowl.  Add 10 tablespoons
room temperature butter and cut in, using pastry blender or fingers,
until mixture resembles coarse meal. Using for, stir in water. Knead
mixture in bowl gently with fingertips just until smooth dough forms.
Shape into rectangle, wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.

Cut 10 tablespoons chilled butter into 9 equal pieces. Arrange pieces
side by side on waxed paper, forming square. Cover with second sheet
of waxed paper. Pound butter several times with rolling pin to make
butter more pliable.  Peel off waxed apper. Break into small pieces.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 9x5 inch rectangle. Turn so that
1 short side faces you. Arrange butter pieces evenly over low 6
inches of dough.  Fold unbuttered 3 inches of dough over half of
buttered dough. Fold remaining 3 inches of buttered dough over,
folding as for letter. Roll out to 12x18-inch rectangle. Fold short
sides over to meetin in center, then fold in half in same direction,
forming approximately 12x4 1/2-inch rectangle.  Repeat rolling to
12x18-inch rectangle and folding to 12x4 1/2-inch rectangle.  Wrap in
plastic; chill. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.)

FOR FILLING:  Melt butter in heavy ovenproof 10-inch skillet
(preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add sugar and stir
until sugar melts and mixture is golden brown, about 8 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat.

Arrange half of apples, rounded side down, in concentric circles in
skillet. Place remaining apples, cut side down, atop first layer of
apples. Cover skillet. Simmer over low heat until apples are almost
tender, about 25 minutes. Uncover skillet. Increase heat to
medium-low; simmer until apples are very tender and liquid is reduced
to 1/4 cup syrup on bottom of pan, pressing apples down into liquid
occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, prehat oven to 400F.  Cut dough in half. Let 1 piece stand
at room temperature until slightly softened, about 15 minutes.
(Freeze second piece of dough for another use.) Roll out dough to
12-inch-diameter round.

Place dough atop hot apples in skillet.  Trim edge, leaving generous
1/2-inch overhang.  Fold overhang down tightly around apples. Cut
several slits in dough to allow steam to escape.

Bake tart until crust is golden, about 45 minutes. Let cool 5
minutes. Run small knife around edge of skillet to loosen tart. Place
large platter over skillet.  Using oven mitts, grasp platter and
skillet and invert, letting tart settle onto platter. Carefully lift
off skillet. Place any apples still in skillet on tart. Cool
slightly; serve warm with ice cream, if desired.

The Original Pineapple Upside Down Cake

cakes, deserts

1 each large can either crushed or sliced
1  hawaiian pineapple
2 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
1 cup sugar
2 each eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoon butter
1 cup brown sugar
1  maraschino cherries garnish

This is the authentic recipe that won in Dole's first recipe contest.
It launched Pineapple Upside Down Cake on its way to fame. It's very
good - and very sweet, as most desserts were in those days.

DIRECTIONS

Drain the juice from 1 large can either Crushed or Sliced Hawaiian
Pineapple. Sift 2 cups flour. Sift again with 2 teaspoons baking
powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cream 1/2 cup butter or substitute,
gradually add 1 cup sugar; cream well. Beat yolks and whites of
2    eggs separately.

Add yolks to creamed mixture; mix well, then add flour and 1/2 cup
milk alternately, mixing well. Fold the 2 beaten egg whites and 1
teaspoon vanilla.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large frying pan. Spread 1 cup of brown
sugar over pan. Add pineapple (if Sliced is used, place slices
closely together on the sugar; if crushed, simply pour in the
well-drained fruit).

Pour cake batter over fruit. Bake 45 minutes. Turn upside-down on
serving dish and garnish with maraschino cherries. Whipped cream may
be spread over top.

The Vegetarian Restaurant's Lemon Poppyseed C

cakes, vegatarian, vegetarian

3/4 cup sunflower seed oil
1 cup demerara sugar
4  eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 teaspoon vanilla
2 cup pastry flour, unbleached
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup poppyseeds
1/4 cup lemon zest
      ----GLAZE----
1/2 cup demerara sugar
1/2 cup lemon juice, fresh
1/8 cup 1 x 1/8 lemon zest  slivers; garnish

1. In electric mixer; blend oil, 1 cup demarara sugar ( substitute
granulated sugar plus a little molasses) and eggs. Add milk and
vanilla. Blend.

2. Sift flour, baking powder together. Add salt and poppy seeds. On
low speed add dry ingredients to wet and blend just until combined.

3. Fold in lemon zest by hand. Pour batter into an oiled 6 to 8 cup
bundt pan. Bake in a 350F oven for 40 to 50 minutes or until done.

4. To make glaze, combine the 1/2 cup demarara sugar and lemon juice.
Heat, stirring until sugar is just dissolved.

5. Remove cake from oven, cool 10 minutes then invert onto plate.
Using a fork, poke holes over entire surface of cake and carefull
pour on the glaze. Let soak before serving. Decorate with slivers of
lemon zest. Makes 8 to 10 servings.
This dish was published by Toronto Star Starweek, Mary McGrath's
Chef's Showcase in the issue of February 26 to March 5, 1994.

The recipe was requested by Diane Silver of Willowdale, Ontario who
writes:

The Lemon Poppyseed Cake at The Vegetarian Restaurant ( 4 Dundonald
St., Toronto, (416) 961-9522 is "absolutely enjoyable and I am hoping
you can publish their version of this classic cake for me".

"We are pleased to share this recipe and suspect the request came
because the cake is unusually moist and has a wonderful strong lemon
flavour", says Susan Stachyra, who manages the bakeshop where
desserts for the downtown restaurant and The West End Vegetarian
Restaurant are turned out. Before getting into the baking business 1
1/2 years ago, the former school teacher from North Bay, Ontario says
that baking was a hobby. Typed into Meal Master format by Eric Decker
March 19, 1994.

Editor's note: If there is any way humanly possible: use real
demerara sugar. Take my word for it, it is near impossible to
duplicate it by adding molasses to granulated sugar. It looks okay
but the flavour just is NOT right for the purist. Posted by Eric to

Tiramisu (Ew)

cakes, deserts

8 oz ladyfingers (60 ladyfingers)
4 tablespoon brandy
1 tablespoon instant coffee (preferably espresso; ) granules
3  large egg whites
1 cup plus 2 t sugar
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
4 oz mascarpone cheese (1/2 c)
4 oz reduced-fat cream cheese (1/2 c), s; oftened
1  chocolate shavings &
1  confectioners' sugar for
1  garnish

If ladyfingers are soft, toast them in a 350 degree F oven for 6 to 8
minutes.

In a small bowl, stir together 3 T of the brandy, coffee granules and
1 cup water.  Brush over the flat side of the ladyfingers. Set aside.

Bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer in the bottom of a large
saucepan. Combine egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and 3 T cold
water in a heatproof mixing bowl that will fit over the saucepan. Set
the bowl over the simmering water and beat with a hand-held mixer at
low speed until an instant-read or candy thermometer registers 140
degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes. Increase speed to high and continue
beating over heat for 3 minutes (The mixture should form a ribbon
trail.) Remove the bowl from the heat and beat until cool and fluffy,
about 4 minutes. Set aside.

In a large bowl, beat mascarpone and cream cheese until creamy. Add
about 1 cup of the beaten whites and the remaining 1 T brandy and
beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Fold in the
remaining whites.

Line the bottom and sides of a 3 quart trifle bowl or souffle dish
with ladyfingers.  Spoon in one-quarter of the filling and tip with a
layer of ladyfingers. Repeat with two more layers of filling and
ladyfinters, arranging the fourth layer of ladyfingers decoratively
over the top, trimming to fit, if necessary. Top with the remaining
filling. Garnish with chocolate shavings.  Cover and chill for at
least 8 hours or overnight. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.

Tom Lester's Fruitcake

cakes, fruits, deserts

      ----CANDIED FRUITS----
1 lb cherries
1 lb pineapple
1 lb citron peel
1/2 lb orange peel
      ----DRIED FRUITS----
1 lb figs
1 lb pitted dates
1 lb raisins
1 lb currants or golden raisins
      ----SHELLED NUTS----
2 1/2 lb pecans
1/4 lb black walnuts (or english)
      ----OTHER INGREDIENTS----
12  eggs
1 lb butter
3 1/2 cup flour (approx.)
2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup heavy molasses (sorghum,  ribbon ca; ne or blackstrap
1/2 teaspoon baking soda (dissolved in  the mola; sses)
      ----SPICES AND FLAVORINGS----
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon allspice
1/2 tablespoon cloves
1 tablespoon nutmeg
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup brandy or whiskey

Makes 8 - 8 inch loaves. Prepare fruits and nuts as desired. Beat
eggs in mixer. Begin creaming the butter. While butter is creaming,
add just enough flour to the fruits and nuts to give each a thin
coating so it won't stick to its neighbor. When the butter is
properly creamed, add eggs, sugar, molasses and soda, spices,
remaining flour, vanilla and brandy. Let mixer go to work on that.
Scoop a depression in the top of the fruit-nut pile and pour the
batter over it. Then mix and knead almost like you would knead bread.
Pack into 8 (8") well-buttered foil loaf pans which have been lined
with foil or brown paper and buttered. Place in a 225 degree oven
with a shallow pan of water below them. If the oven temperature is
right, they should be done in 3 to 4 hours. After 1-1/2 hours watch
them carefully, and if the edges begin to crisp before the to cracks
in numerous breaks, turn the heat down and put in a fresh pan of cool
water. When little cracks come across the tops of the cakes they are
done. When cool, remove them from the pans. When cold dab whiskey or
brandy liberally over the outside. Wrap each separately in wax paper,
then in aluminum foil. Cover with newspaper and set away to age in a
cool place. This aging takes about a month; the alcohol will have
evaporated by then and have left only the bouquet and flavor.

Topfenkuchen

cakes, german

2 1/2 cup flour; sift on pastry board
1/2 cup sugar
2  egg yolks
1 cup butter; softened
2 teaspoon lemon rind; grated
1 1/2 cup cottage cheese; sieved
4  egg yolks
2 teaspoon lemon rind; grated
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon flour
4  egg whites
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup almonds; slivered/blanched

Make a well in the center of the flour and put into it the next four
ingredients.  Quickly work these ingredients into the flour to make a
smooth dough, adding a bit more flour if needed, to facilitate
handling. On a floured board, roll out the dough into a 11X17"
rectangle. Line a baking sheet with the dough and bake it in a
moderate oven (350 degrees F>), for about 15 minutes, or until it is
about half done. Let it cool.
Add the 4  egg yolks and lemon rind to the cottage cheese. Beat the
egg whites until very stiff, gradually adding the sugar, beginning
when they have slightly stiffened. Fold the beaten egg whites into
the cheese and spread the cooled pastry shell with the cheese
filling. Sprinkle the cake with the raisins and almonds.
Bake in a very slow oven (250 degrees F.) about 45 minutes. Let cool
and cut into large squares.

3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup sweet butter or margarine
1 cup granulated sugar
3  eggs
2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup plain yogurt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup raisins
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Cream the butter and sugar together, then add the eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition. Meanwhile, sift the flour with the
baking powder and salt and add gradually to the batter, beating on
medium speed. Combine the yogurt with the baking soda and add to the
batter, a few tablespoons at a time, along with the vanilla.

Mix together the raisins, spices, and if desired, the walnuts. Pour
half the batter into a buttered 9-inch-square pan and sprinkle half
the raisin mixture evenly over it. Pour in the rest of the batter and
top with the raisin mixture.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees F)
for 40 to 45 minutes, or until cake springs back to the touch of your
finger. Remove to a cake rack and cool in the pan. Cut into squares

Trifle 2

cakes, deserts, ethnic

1  9-inch sponge cake layer
3/4 cup dry sherry
2 pkg frozen raspberries
2 pkg frozen peaches
1  chilled custard sauce
2  egg whites
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds
1  custard sauce
2 cup milk
6  egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar
1  pinch of salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

This is a wonderful recipe.  It calls for frozen fruit, but I don't
see why you couldn't substitute fresh fruit if available.

Thaw and drain fruit.  Slice sponge cake into three thin layers.
Place one layer in the bottom of a serving bowl. It should be
flat-bottomed and about 10 inches across and five inches deep. If you
have one of glass, use it because the layers of the trifle look very
pretty. Sprinkle the cake layer with one-quarter cup sherry. Spread
about 1 third of the raspberries and peach slices on top. Pour
one-third of the custard over the fruit. Repeat cake, sherry, fruit
and custard layers, saving a dozen or so raspberries for garnish. To
make the topping, beat egg white until stiff and in a separate bowl,
whip cream. Stir sugar into cream and gently fold in beaten egg
white. Mound cream and egg white mixture over the top of the trifle.
Garnish with raspberries and toasted almonds. Refrigerate until ready
to serve.

Custard Sauce: Scald milk in a double boiler. Meanwhile, beat egg
yolks and add sugar and salt. Pour a little hot milk into the egg
yolk mixture, beating with a fork, and then stir into the rest of the
milk. Place over simmering, not boiling, water and cook -- stirring
until the mixture coats a metal spoon. Pour the cutard into a bowl
and stir in the vanilla. Cover and refrigerate for one hour or until
thickened before adding to trifle. From: Sandee Eveland

      ----VULCAN WEDDING CAKE (CARROT----
6 oz ground almonds
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cloves
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
6 oz grated carrots
1 tablespoon vulcan bitter nectar*
1 tablespoon grated lemon rind
1 tablespoon lemon juice
5 tablespoon margarine
6 oz sugar; a bit more than 3/4 c
5  eggs

*Dark Jamaican rum may be used. To be made as a wedding cake, many
rituals would have to be performed during the making of the cake.
This is a nonritual version. Sift the ground almonds and flour
together to make a very fine mixture. Add the salt, spices and baking
powder and mix well. In a separate bowl put the grated carrots and
the nectar. Add the lemon rind and juice. Cover and let stand. Cream
the margarine and sugar together. Separate the eggs, putting the
yolks in with the margarine and sugar and saving the whites for
later. Beat the egg yolks in and then add the carrot mixture. Stir
well and let sit for a few minutes. Beat the egg whites until soft
peaks form, then set aside. Add the dry ingredients to the carrot
mixture and mix well. You should have a thick batter. Now beat the
egg whites a little more and fold the batter into the egg whites. Mix
gently until it is just barely evenly mixed. Pour into a greased ring
mold. Bake at 325 degrees for about 50 minutes. It is done when a
skewer comes out clean. Take out of the oven and let cool for 5
minutes. Unmold onto a serving plate dusted with confections sugar
(this prevents the cake from sticking as much).

Title: USING THE CHINESE CLEAVER (PART 1)
Categories: Info/tips, Wok
Yield: 1 Info

No ingredients

With a little practice, any beginning wok cook can master the use of
the Chinese cleaver. As mentioned earlier, a Chinese cleaver must be
honed very sharply before use and one should have a suitable cutting
board on hand.

The Styles of cutting foods for Chinese cooking include slicing,
dicing, shredding and mincing. It cannot be stressed enough that
students must exercise safety in the use of the Chinese cleaver. A
dull cleaver or knife will cause accidents as the cook will have to
work too hard at slicing anything. A sharp knife will also cause
accidents, if not held properly.

To hold a cleaver properly for cutting, one should take his right
hand (or left hand, if left handed) and get a firm comfortable grip
on his cleaver. The other hand should be free to hold or move the
food as it is being cut. If a food, such as a potato, is round, it is
best to hold it firm on the cutting board and with your free hand cut
the potato directly in half. Lay the flat side down on the cutting
board and continue slicing. By creating a flat surface, a round food
is prevented from rolling, thereby lessening the chances of an
accident.

There are two types of slicing styles in Chinese cooking. The first is
straight slicing and the other is diagonal slicing. There should be a
rhythm of motion involved in slicing foods and this may be achieved
by the novice cook with practice. For slicing, insert the forward
blade of the cleaver into the food. Your free hand should hold the
food onto the cutting board. Press down toward the back part of the
blade, slice. The motion should be forward to back. Use your free
hand to push food up to the knife blade, keeping the fingers tucked
in. The blade should be kept as close to the cutting board as
possible. Repeat slicing motion until all food is cut. This slicing
motion is done with ease. Great pressure need not be exerted on the
knife. If you are using great pressure on your knife then you are
cutting with unnecessary effort or else the knife is dull. Usually
the novice cook does quite well until he gets to slicing the end
piece of the food, then it is better to go slower to finish off the
job.

The main point that must be emphasized for wok cookery is that the
food should be sliced as uniformly as possible. This is to allow like
foods to be cooked at the same time. If some slices of a like food
are thick while others are medium or thin, then the thin slices will
be undercooked. So strive for uniformity in cutting.

Meats, especially beef, should be sliced across the grain of the
meat. This is to prevent the meat from becoming "tough" when it is
cooked. The most difficult type of meat for novice cooks to cut is
beef. It also is the easiest to overcook and render "tough." For
anyone who has difficulty in learning to cut beef, it might be better
to use a thin sharp blade knife (like the 1 1/2" cleaver). Lay the
beef flat with the muscular or long fibers perpendicular to the
cutting board. Insert the forward blade of the knife across the grain
of the beef. Take your free hand and lay the fingers over the slice
of beef that you wish to cut. Slice slowly towards yourself. You can
feel the thickness of your beef slice. Try to slice your beef about
2x1/2" in length and breadth, and about 1/8" to 1/4" thick. Some
beginning wok cooks are afraid of holding the beef with their free
fingers. This is incorrect as it will cause either accidents or
result in coarsely, uneven cut beef. If you are initially afraid of
the knife, do the cutting very slowly until you gain more confidence.
The finished cooked dish will be the reward for your patience.

1  karen mintzias
2 1/2 cup 100% whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon mixed spice

4 tablespoon vegan margarine
1 cup real barbados sugar
1 1/2 cup mixed dried fruit
1/4 cup mixed candied peel

Sift the flour with the mixed spice into a mixing bowl. Rub the
margarine into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture looks
like fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the sugar, dried fruit, mixed
peel, cherries, orange rind, ground and blanched almonds.

Warm half the soy milk or water in a small saucepan and add the
vinegar. Dissolve the baking soda in the rest of the soy milk or
water, then combine the two mixtures.

Stir this mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring well so that
everything is combined.  Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan.

Vegan Snowy Mountain

cakes, fruits, deserts, tofu

1/2 each chocolate cake, see recipe
2 tablespoon malibu*
2 each oranges, peeled & diced
1/2 cup tofu
3 tablespoon rum**
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup coconut, shredded

For this recipe, you need 1/2 of the chocolate cake recipe, so freeze
half or set aside for future use.

Roughly cut up the chocolate cake into good bite-sized pieces & place
in a medium sized serving dish.  Soak with the malibu. Arrange the
chopped oranges over the cake. Set aside.

In a food processor or blender, blend the tofu until smooth. Add the
remaining ingredients & blend until well mixed. Spread over the top
of the cake & oranges. Chill until ready to serve.

* I liked the coconut-pineapple taste that the malibu provided, you
could use orange juice in place if you desire.

** Use some rum extract instead of rum & reduce the amount. Or use a
fruit juice that might combine well with coconut but that is clear,
otherwise the topping will look a funny colour.

VARIATIONS: Use canned fruits, fruit salads or other fresh fruits of
your choice.  I find that naturally juicy fruits work the best.

Use a plain sponge cake instead of the chocolate cake.

Garnish with strawberries or kiwis before serving.

Velvet Underground Cake

cakes

4 oz unsweetened chocolate
2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup hot strong brewed coffee or
5 teaspoon instant coffee powder
1  dissolved in 1 c. hot water
1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 large eggs, lightly beaten, room temperat; ure

Preheat oven to 345.  Lightly grease two 8-in. layer cake pans with
oil or butter, or line them with parchment circles. Melt chocolate in
top of double boiler placed over simmering water, then turn off the
heat. Sift sugar, flour, baking soda and salt together into a large
mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, blend the hot coffee, sour cream,
and vegetable oil with whisk.

With the mixer on low speed, add the coffee mixture in a stream to
the dry ingredients and mix until blended, about 35 seconds. Stop
mixer to scrape the bowl several times with spatula. Add eggs one at
a time and mix on medium-low speed after each addition until smooth,
about 15 seconds. Scrape bowl each time. Add chocolate and mix until
batter is uniform in color, about 10 seconds.

Divide batter evenly between pans and  place on center rack in oven.
Bake until cake springs back to touch and tester comes out dry (do
not wait for crust to form), 35 to 38 minutes. Cool layers in the
pans on a rack.

Fudge Filling

2 oz. unsweetened chocolate 2 T. unsalted butter 5 T. plus 1 1/2 tsp.
sugar 6 T. hot water 1/2 tsp. vanilla

Place all ingredients except vanilla in top of double boiler over
simmering water and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the
chocolate is melted and sugar dissolved, about 30 minutes. Mixture
will be smooth and velvety. Pour fudge into small bowl, stir in
vanilla and refrigerate until the mixture is thick and of spreading
consistency, 2 hours.

Buttercream

8 T. unsalted butter, room temperature 1 1/4 C. confectioner's sugar
3/4 C. plus 2 T. heavy (whipping) cream, chilled

Place all ingredients in a food processor and process until light and
fluffy, about 5 minutes. Stop mixer several times to scrape down
sides of bowl. Transfer buttercream to medium-size mixing bowl and,
using the paddle attachment of an electric mixer, continue to beat on
medium-high speed, until buttercream is white and fluffy, 15 to 20
minutes. Stop mixer to scrape bowl several times. (If you don't have
a paddle attachment, use whisk.)  Use buttercream within an hour or
it will need rewhipping.

Assembly

Spread all interior layers of cake with fudge filling and outside of
cake with about 1 1/2 C. of buttercream. Shave 1 oz. dark chocolate
over surface of cake with a fine grater, then use the knife method of
shaving to make darker accents on the top of the cake. Makes 12 to 16
servings.

Enjoy!

Vienesse Jam Cakes

cakes, cookies

1  from: gaye levy dtxt63a
3/4 cup unsalted butter; well chilled cut into 12
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup raspberry preserves
2 tablespoon powdered sugar

Using the steel blade of your Food Processor, chop butter with 1/4 cup
sugar until butter is the size of small peas, using 4 or 5 on/off
turns. Add sour cream, vanilla and salt and blend just until
combined, using about 10 on/off turns.  Sprinkle flour over and blend
just until granular crumbs form, about 15 seconds.

Press 1 generous tablespoon of crumb mixture into each of 24 miniature
muffin cups (1 3/4 diameter top). Bake at 350~ until edges of each
cake are just golden, about 22 minutes.

Immediately make 3/8-inch deep indentation in center of each using
end of a wooden spoon. Fill each with about 1/2 tsp preserves. Let
cool in pan 10 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool completely. Just
before serving, sprinkle sift powdered sugar over top of each.

Notes from Gaye: Warning! these are addictive and a threat to your
hips. They are THAT good. These will keep in an airtight container
for 2 days or frozen for future use. Substitute any type of jam or
preserves. These taste good even when you use margarine or shortening
instead of butter (which I refuse to use for health reasons).

Whipped Cream

cakes

1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon fine granulated sugar (opt)
1 teaspoon vanilla

Cream for whipping should be at least 1 day old.  It can be kept in
the refrigerator in a sealed container for more than a week. Before
being whipped it should be very cold. In hot weather the bowl and
beater should also be chilled.

Using a well chilled bowl, or setting the bowl over ice, beat cream
with an electric mixer or rotary egg beater. As cream begins to
thicken, beat in sugar and vanilla. Continue beating until stiff. If
not to be served at once, place in refrigerator, where it may be kept
2-3 hours.

The Yield From A Cup of Cream Can Be Increased (with a very slight
difference in texture) by adding 1 egg white to each cup of whipped
and flavored cream.  Beat the egg white until it holds soft peaks.
Sprinkle in 1 1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar.  Continue beating til
very stiff. Fold into whipped cream.

To Prepare Whipped Cream A Day or Two Ahead of Time: Soften 1/2
teaspoon granulated gelatin (for each cup of cream to be whipped) in
a small metal cup containing a tablespoon of cold water. Set cup in a
pan of boiling water or over low heat, until gelatin dissolves and
looks clear. Stirring is unneccessary. Beat dissolved gelatin into
the cream just as cream begins to thicken.

Gelatin will also give whipped cream extra firmness so it can be used
for decorating with a pastry bag.

Flavoring Whipped Cream To each cup of whipped cream, 1 of the
following flavorings can be added: 2 tb sifted dark, unsweetened
cocoa 2 4 tb rum, cognac, or any liquer 1/2 c nougat powder 1 ts
instant coffee powder

Fold flavorings into cream AFTER it has been whipped.

White Ivory Cream Cake

cakes

      ----CAKE----
8 oz white chocolate, finely
1  .chopped
3 cup sifted cake flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  stick unsalted butter (1/2c)
1 1/4 cup sugar
3 large eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup + 1 t milk
      ----FILLING AND FROSTING----
1 1/2 lb white chocolate, finely
1  .chopped
2 1/2 cup heavy cream
6 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup coarsely chopped macadamia
1  .nuts
      ----GARNISH----
1  white macadamia nuts &
1  strawberries or raspberries

1. Preheat oven to 350F. Butter and flour 2 9-inch cake pans. 2. Make
the Cake: In a double boiler, melt the white chocolate over hot, not
simmering, water. Set aside to cool slightly. 3. In a large bowl with
an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs one
at a time, beating well after each addition. On low speed, add the
melted chocolate and the vanilla. In three additions, on low speed,
alternately beat in the flour mixture and the milk. Beat until just
smooth, about 20 seconds. 4. Pour the batter into the prepared pans
and bake for 25 - 30 minutes or until the top is golden and a cake
tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Set the cake pans on a
wire rack to cool for 20 minutes. Then invert the cakes onto the
racks to cool completely. 5. Prepare the Filling and Frosting: Place
the white chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small heavy saucepan,
bring 1 1/2 cups of the cream and the butter to a simmer. Pour over
the chocolate. Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes, then stir until
smooth. Refrigerate the white chocolate mixture until firm enough to
spread, about 1 hour. 6. To Assemble: Spread the bottom layer with 1
cup of the chilled white chocolate mixture. Arrange the chopped
macadamia nuts over the filling, and top with the second cake layer.
7. In a medium bowl, beat the remaining 1 cup cream until firm peaks
form. Fold the whipped cream into the remaining white chocolate
mixture. Spread this over the top and sides of the cake. Arrange
whole macadamia nuts around the rim and base of the cake. Chill until
ready to serve. Garnish each piece with a fanned strawberry or
raspberries.

mixer if you want your cake especially light). Bake in a Pam sprayed
8 or 9 inch square pan at 350F (180 C) for 30-35 minutes or until
toothpick-test done.* I didn't use a frosting-it was very moist and
yummy without. If you must, you could mix ff cream cheese, vanilla

*insert toothpick into center of cake.   If it comes out clean, the
cake is done.

Wickedly Rich Double Fudge Brownies

appetizers, beverages, cakes, cookies, spreads
eggs, nuts, alcohol

      ----BROWNIES:----
5 oz unsweetened chocolate
10 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 large eggs, at room temperature
3/4 cup plus 2 t sifted ap flour
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
      ----MOCHA FUDGE FROSTING:----
4 oz semisweet chocolate
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon instant coffee granules
1/3 cup evaporated milk
2 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 tablespoon unsalted butter; softened
2 teaspoon cognac or dark rum; (opt.)
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts

1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325^F. Line a
9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil so that the foil extends 2
inches beyond two opposite sides of the pan. Fold the overhang down along
the outside of the pan.  Lightly butter the bottom of the foil-lined pan.

2. In the top of a double boiler set over hot, not simmering water, melt
the chocolate with the butter, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove
the top part of the double boiler from the bottom and transfer the
chocolate mixture to a large bowl.  Let the chocolate mixture cool for
about 10 minutes, or until tepid.

3. Add the sugar and the salt to the tepid chocolate mixture. Using a
hand-held electric mixer set at low speed, beat the mixture for 15 to 20
seconds, until blended. Scrape the bottom and side of the bowl with a
rubber spatula. Beat in the corn syrup and vanilla.

4. One at a time, add the eggs, beating for no longer than 5 seconds after
each addition. Using a rubber spatula, stir in the flour mixture. Stir in
the walnuts.

5. Scrape the batter into the pan and spread it evenly with the back of a
spoon.

6. Bake the brownies for 30 to 35 minutes, until a wooden toothpick
inserted into the center comes out sightly creamy.  Do not overbake the
brownies. Cool the brownies completely in the pan set on a wire rack.

Make the mocha fudge frosting:

7. In a small cup, stir together vanilla and coffee granules.

8. Melt the chocolate by one of the following two methods:

a) In a microwave oven - place coarsely chopped chocolate in a
microwave-safe container and microwave at MEDIUM (50% power) for 1.1/2 to
4 minutes, until the chocolate turns shiny. Remove the container from the
microwave and stir the chocolate until completely melted. Stir milk and
white chocolates after about 1.1/2 minutes. Because of their milk
proteins, they need to be stirred sooner than dark chocolate. (If
overheated, these chocolates may become grainy)

b) In a double boiler - place coarsely chopped chocolate in the top of a
double boiler over hot, not simmering, water. Melt the chocolate, stirring
until smooth. Remove the top part of the double boiler from the bottom.

9. Put the milk, corn syrup, butter and vanilla/coffee mixture into the
container of an electric blender. If desired, add the cognac or rum. Add
the melted chocolate. Cover and blend at low speed for 20 to 45 seconds,
until the frosting is thick and creamy. Use the frosting immediately.

10. Using a small offset metal cake spatula, frost the brownies with the
mocha fudge frosting. Sprinkle the walnuts over the top of the frosted
brownies. Chill the brownies in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the
frosting has set. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and let the brownies
sit overnight at room temperature.

11. Using the two ends of the foil as a handle, lift the brownies out of
the pan. With a large, sharp knife, cut the brownies from the foil and
store then in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.

Wilton Marshmallow Cream Flow-In

cakes, deserts, frostings

1  jar marshmallow cream for each colo; r desired
1  icing color

This stays very shiny and is easy to cut through. These decorations
will not dry hard as Wilton color-flow & must be done directly on the
cake or cookie.  CAUTION - Marshmallow cream will be VERY HOT. TO
PREPARE MARSHMALLOW CREAM - Pan Method: Place about 1 1/2" water in a
large skillet or electric pan.  Depending upon design,  set up to
four jars of marshmallow cream (one for each color) into pan and
bring water to a boil. For faster heating, fill jars only halfway.
Add icing color as the cream softens, stir until color is well
blended. Let simmer, then stir until cream is smooth.  Leave jars in
water while you decorate. Microwave Method: Place the desired amount
of marshmallow cream in a bowl. Add desired past color.  Microwave on
high power for about 10 to 12 seconds, then stir. If not softened
(the total time depends on quantity being heated) microwave again for
7 to 8 seconds more. After heating, stir until color is completely
blended. TO DECORATE: Trace pattern on cake with a toothpick. Outline
design with stiffened buttercream or royal icing (royal is preferred
as the heat of the marshmallow cream may soften buttercream) and tip
3. Let outlines dry for 10 minutes or more. Cut a very small opening
in the end of a parchment bag and fill with marshmallow cream.
"Flow-in" by filling in along the edges of the outline first,
squeezing gently and letting the icing flow up to the outline almost
by itself. Work quickly; filling in design from the outside edges in
and from top to bottom. If you're working with a large area, have 2
parchment bags ready so it won't set up before you're done.  If the
marshmallow starts cooling and won't flow smoothly, simply microwave
bags for about 7 to 8 seconds on high power.  Any remaining cream can
be stored in a jar & reused by microwaving for 8-9 seconds until soft.

Wiltshire Whitsun Cake

cakes, deserts, ethnic

3/4 lb sm. tart green gooseberries
5  elderflower blossoms*
1/2 lb plain wholemeal flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 large eggs
6 oz butter
6 oz pale muscovado sugar
1  demerara sugar
1  flowers & leaves to garnish

*Note: A handful of sweet geranium or lemon balm leaves may be
substitued for elderflower blossoms if desired.

Top and tail the gooseberries into a mixing bowl.  Add the finely
chopped leaves or the florets of elderflower carefully stripped from
the stalk, and stir to mix with the fruit.  Sift the flour and baking
powder into a separate bowl.  Cut then rub in the butter. Stir in the
muscovado sugar then the lightly beaten eggs. Finally, stir in the
gooseberries and their flavourings.

Grease the base of an 8-inch spring-clip cake tin, line and grease
again. Turn the cake mixture into it and mound it up in the middle.
Bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for about 1 1/2 hours. Unlike most
cakes, this one does not come away from the sides of the tin when it
is cooked.

Cool for a few minutes before unmoulding.  Sprinkle with demerara
sugar and decorate with fresh elder blossom or sweet geranium or
melissa leaves, and serve the deliciously moist cake while it is
still warm - as a pudding, with plenty of cream.

Yellow Cake Mix

cakes, make ahead

1 7/8 cup cake flour
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup vegetable shortening

Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt; stir to blend; resift
with sugar.  Cut the shortening into the dry ingredients until the
mixture looks crumbly. Label and store in a sealed plastic bag at
room temperature. Makes 1 pakage mix. Each package makes two 8 or 9
inch layers or one 9 x 13 x 2 inch rectangle. TO USE: Pour 1 package
of mix into a mixing bowl; add 3/4 cup milk and 1 1/4 teaspoons
vanilla extract. Using either an electric or manual rotary beater,
beat at slow to medium speed for two minutes (by hand, beat 3 minutes
averaging 135 strokes per minute). Scrape the sides of the bowl
frequently as you beat. Add 2 eggs; beat 1 minute more (2 minutes by
hand). Grease and dust with flour your choice of pan(s); spread
batter evenly in pans. Bake round cake pans at 375 degrees F. for
about 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes
out clean; bake the 9 x 13 x 2 inch pan for 30 to 35 minutes or until
a toothpick comes out clean. Cool cake(s) for 10 minutes in their
pan(s) before turning out on racks. WHITE CAKE Follow the same
directions as for Yellow Cake replacing the 2 eggs with 3 unbeaten
egg whites. Use an electric mixer for beating. SPICE CAKE Add to the
package of Yellow Cake Mix: 1/4 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon ground
cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, and a pinch of ground allspice.
Follow Yellow Cake directions. EXTRACT FLOVORED CAKES Replace the
vanilla in either the Yellow or White Cake recipes with 2 to 3
teaspoons of the extract of your choice.  You may want to add a few
drops of food coloring for the flavors like lemon, orange, or cherry,
etc. FRESH ORANGE CAKE Pour 1 package of Yellow Cake Mix into a bowl;
add 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 tablespoon freshly grated orange peel
(1 teaspoon dried). Squeeze the juice from 1 large orange and add to
it enough water to measure 1 cup. Add this orange juice to the mix,
beat for 2 minutes as directed previously; add 2 eggs; beat and bake
as directed. CUPCAKES Pour cake batter into greased cupcake tins or
tins lined with paper baking cups; fill 1/2 to 2/3 full.  Bake at 375
degrees F. for 20 to 25 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes
out clean. Makes about 2= dozen. NOTE: To prevent a cake from
sticking to its pan, put the pan on a wet towel to cool as soon as
you take it out of the oven.

Zucchini & Walnut Cake

cakes

1 1/2 cup walnut pieces
2 medium zucchini, unpeeled, ends trimmed
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 cup brown rice flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
3 large eggs
3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoon diced candied lemon peel, finely mi; nced

Powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter the sides of an 8 x 2-inch cake pan,
line the base with a circle of baking parchment and butter the
parchment. Using a nut mill, grind walnuts to flour and set aside.
Using the same nut mill, grind zucchini into fine shreds.  There
should be 1 cup, firmly packed, or 6 ounces.  Place in a sieve and
press out the liquid. Combine cornstarch, rice flour, baking powder
and salt; set aside.

Beat eggs with sugar until lemon-colored and very thick. A lifted
beater should leave a slowly dissolving trail of batter. Using a
large rubber spatula, lightly fold in grated walnuts and minced lemon
peel, as though mixing a souffle.  Fluff up zucchini shreds and fold
in. Sift cornstarch-flour mixture over batter and quickly fold in,
retaining as much volume as possible.

Pour into prepared pan (the batter will be loose) and bake for 40
minutes, until a tester comes out dry. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes
before unmolding onto a rack. Peel off paper, reverse onto rack right
side up, and let cool completely.

Dust with powdered sugar before serving.

soda and salt. Blend dry ingredients. Beat egg. Add yogurt, sugar and
vanilla. Add alternately dry mix and egg mix alternately to zucchini.

Icing:  combine powdered sugar, cinnamon, orange juice and liqueur in
bowl. Mix til smooth.  Use immediately.

Orange Glaze: Stir together til smooth.

Note: Avoid using dry old dates. For slightly softer cake texture,
add 2 Tbsp melted butter to batter before folding into squash. This
will add 2 grams fat per serving. From: The Spectator....Aug 12/92
There is yellow squash hidden in this cake, but you'd never guess it.
It's delicate, faintly sweet flavor blends right in. You can use
crook neck, straight neck or even yellow zucchini, but be sure to
select young squach with soft, thin skins. (why not green zucchini?)
This cake, with its accent of chopped dates, needs only a simple
icing to dress it up To add extra moistness and a sweet citrus
flavour, poke all over the warm cake and pour optional glaze over the
cake til it soaks in.

Adapted from a rich recipe with sour cream and pecans created by the
late Bert Greene.
