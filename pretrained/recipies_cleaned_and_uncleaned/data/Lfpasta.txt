   1 1/2  cup           chopped onions
   1 1/2  cup           finely chopped carrots
   2      cloves        garlic -- minced
   2      boxes         frozen artichoke hearts -- thawed
                        --9-ounce boxes
                        --and coarsely chopped
                        --or two 8 1/2-ounce cans artichoke
                        -- hearts
                        --drained and squeezed dry
                        --and coarsely chopped
     1/2  cup           defatted reduced-sodium chicken broth
   4      ounces        prosciutto
                        --trimmed of fat and chopped

1. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles until barely tender (8 minutes for dried, 1 minute for fresh). Drain and rinse under cold water. Spread the noodles on clean kitchen towels, cover with plastic wrap and set aside.

2. In a large saucepan, heat 2 1/2 cups of the milk over medium heat until steaming. Meanwhile, put 1/3 cup flour in a small bowl and gradually whisk in the remaining 1/2 cup milk until smooth; whisk into the hot milk and stir constantly over the heat until the sauce comes to a simmer and thickens. Continue cooking and stirring for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Whisk in cream cheese, then 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, thyme, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Set the cheese sauce aside.

3. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onions and carrots and cook, stirring, until they begin to color and soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir for 1 minute longer. Add artichoke hearts and sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon flour. Stir well, add chicken broth and cook until the liquid is thick and simmering, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.

4. Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly oil a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or coat it with nonstick cooking spray.

5. Smear the bottom of the prepared dish with 1/2 cup of the cheese sauce. Line the bottom with a single layer of noodles. Spread half of the artichoke mixture over the noodles. Spoon on another 1/2 cup sauce and use a rubber spatula to spread it evenly. Add another layer of noodles, sprinkle with all of the prosciutto and spread another 1/2 cup sauce on top. Add a third layer of noodles, the remaining artichoke mixture and spread with 1/2 cup sauce. Finish with the remaining noodles and sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan.

6. Lightly oil a large piece of aluminum foil or coat it with nonstick cooking spray, and use it to tightly cover the dish. Bake the lasagna for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for about 15 minutes more, or until the top is lightly browned. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

   1      cup           dry white wine
   4      sprigs        fresh parsley -- plus
     1/2  cup           coarsely chopped leaves
   4      sprigs        fresh basil -- plus

   1      tablespoon    olive oil
   3      cloves        garlic -- minced
     1/2  teaspoon      crushed red pepper -- or to taste
   3      large         vine-ripened tomatoes -- peeled, up to 4
                        --seeded and chopped
                        --3 cups
     1/2  teaspoon      salt

     1/2  teaspoon      freshly ground black pepper
                        --plus more to taste
   1      pound         dried linguine or fettuccine

1. In a large pot, combine wine and parsley and basil sprigs. Bring to a boil over high heat.

2. Add mussels, cover and steam for 2 minutes, shaking the pot occasionally. Begin checking mussels; as they open, transfer them to a large bowl. Total steaming time will be about 5 minutes. Discard any unopened mussels.

3. Strain mussel broth through a fine sieve lined with cheesecloth; measure our 1 1/2 cups and set aside. (Freeze any remaining broth for another use.) When cool enough to handle, pick mussels from their shells. Refrigerate, discarding shells.

4. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for cooking pasta.

5. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, combine oil, garlic and crushed red pepper. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and reserved broth. Increase heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes form a thick sauce, 20 to 25 minutes.

6. Shortly before sauce has finished cooking, add reserved mussels and cook just until heated through. Cook pasta until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain pasta and place in a large bowl. Add sauce, remaining 1/2 cup each of parsley and basil, and toss. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

Makes about 8 cups, for 4 servings.

   2      cloves        garlic -- minced
  12      ounces        fresh mushrooms -- sliced
                        --wild and/or cultivated
   1 1/2  teaspoon      chopped fresh rosemary
                        --or 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
     1/2  cup           freshly grated parmesan cheese
   1 1/2  pound         butternut squash -- peeled
                        --and thinly sliced
                        --4 cups

1. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles until barely tender (8 minutes for dried, 1 minute for fresh). Drain and rinse under cold water. Spread the noodles on clean kitchen towels, cover with plastic wrap and set aside.

2. In a small bowl, combine sun-dried tomatoes and dried porcini mushrooms. Add 1 cup boiling water, cover and let stand for 10 minutes. Lift out the tomatoes and mushrooms and chop. Strain the soaking liquid through a fine sieve and set aside.

3. In a saucepan, heat 1 cup of the milk over medium heat until steaming. Meanwhile, put 3 tablespoons flour in a small bowl and gradually whisk in the remaining 1/3 cup milk until smooth; whisk into the hot milk and stir constantly over the heat until the sauce comes to a simmer and thickens. Continue cooking and stirring for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Whisk in cream cheese, then 2/3 cup of the spaghetti sauce and vinegar. Season the sauce with salt and pepper; set aside.

4. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onions, carrots and garlic and sauté until soft, about 2 minutes. Add fresh mushrooms, rosemary and the reserved tomatoes and porcini; cook until the fresh mushrooms are just wilted, about 2 minutes longer. Stir the remaining 1 teaspoon flour into the vegetables. Add the reserved soaking liquid and the remaining 1/3 cup spaghetti sauce and cook until the mixture thickens, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.

5. Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly oil a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or coat it with nonstick cooking spray.

6. Smear the bottom of the prepared dish with 1/2 cup of the sauce. Line the bottom with a single layer of noodles. Spread half of the mushroom mixture over the noodles and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan. Add another layer of noodles, arrange butternut squash on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread another 1/2 cup sauce over all. Add another layer of noodles, followed by the remaining mushroom mixture; sprinkle with 2 more tablespoons of the Parmesan. Finish with the remaining noodles and sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan.

7. Lightly oil a large piece of aluminum foil or coat it with nonstick cooking spray, and use it to tightly cover the dish. Bake the lasagna for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for 10 to 15 minutes more, or until lightly browned and bubbling. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

Makes 8 servings.

                        freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
   2      cups          prepared spaghetti sauce
  14      ounces        canned tomatoes -- drained
                        --seeded and chopped
   2      teaspoons     red-wine vinegar
   1      cup           grated part-skim mozzarella cheese

1. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles until barely tender (8 minutes for dried, 1 minute for fresh). Drain and rinse under cold water. Spread the noodles on clean kitchen towels, cover with plastic wrap and set aside.

2. Preheat oven to 400°F. Place rack in lower third of oven.

3. In a large bowl, toss eggplant slices with 1 1/2 tablespoons salt. Add cold water to cover and place a bowl on top of the slices to keep them submerged. Let soak for 5 minutes. Drain, rinse and pat dry.

4. Brush each of 2 nonstick baking sheets with 1/2 tablespoon oil. Spread the eggplant slices on the oiled baking sheets. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until browned on the underside. (If the baking sheets will not fit side by side on the rack, use the middle rack as well and switch the positions of the pans midway.) Turn the slices over and bake for about 7 minutes more, or until browned on the second side.

5. Meanwhile, combine cottage cheese, garlic and cornstarch in a food processor and process until very smooth. Transfer to a bowl and stir in chopped basil and 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper.

6. In another bowl, combine spaghetti sauce, tomatoes and vinegar. Season the tomato sauce with salt and pepper.

7. Lightly oil a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or coat it with nonstick cooking spray. Smear the bottom of the prepared dish with 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce. Line the bottom with a single layer of noodles. Cover the noodles with half of the eggplant slices. Spread 3/4 cup of the tomato sauce over the eggplant, then sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the remaining Parmesan. Top with another layer of noodles. Spread all of the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Add another layer of noodles and the remaining eggplant slices. Spread with 3/4 cup tomato sauce and sprinkle with the final tablespoon of Parmesan. Finish with the remaining noodles and tomato sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.

8. Lightly oil a large piece of aluminum foil or coat it with nonstick cooking spray, and use it to tightly cover the dish. Bake the lasagna for 30 minutes on the middle oven rack. Uncover the pan and bake for 10 to 15 minutes more, or until lightly browned and bubbling. Let stand for 10 minutes. Garnish with whole basil and serve.

                        --removed from casing
   1      teaspoon      olive oil
   1                    onion -- sliced
   2      cloves        garlic -- minced
   1      teaspoon      dried marjoram or oregano
     1/2  teaspoon      fennel seeds
   7      ounces        roasted red peppers -- drained and chopped
                        --about 3/4 cup
     1/2  cup           dry white wine
     1/2  cup           grated part-skim mozzarella cheese
   1      tablespoon    chopped fresh parsley

1. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles until barely tender (8 minutes for dried, 1 minute for fresh). Drain and rinse under cold water. Spread the noodles on clean kitchen towels, cover with plastic wrap and set aside.

2. In a large saucepan, heat 2 1/2 cups of the milk over medium heat until steaming. Meanwhile, put flour in a small bowl and gradually whisk in the remaining 1/2 cup milk until smooth; whisk into the hot milk and stir constantly over the heat until the sauce comes to a simmer and thickens. Continue cooking and stirring for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Whisk in cream cheese, then Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and nutmeg. Set the cheese sauce aside.

3. In a bowl, stir together spinach and cottage cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

4. In a large nonstick skillet, cook sausage over medium-high heat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until it is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and chop fine. Set aside.

5. Wipe the skillet clean and add oil. Return the pan to the heat, add onions and cook, stirring, until well-browned, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, marjoram or oregano, and fennel seeds and cook for 1 minute longer. Stir in peppers, wine and the cooked sausage and simmer until the wine has nearly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.

6. Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly oil a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or coat it with nonstick cooking spray.

7. Smear the bottom of the prepared dish with 1/2 cup of the cheese sauce. Line the bottom with a single layer of noodles. Spread half of the spinach mixture over the noodles. Spoon on another 1/2 cup of sauce and use a rubber spatula to spread it evenly. Add another layer of noodles, top with all of the sausage mixture and another 1/2 cup sauce. Add a third layer of noodles, the remaining spinach mixture and another 1/2 cup sauce. Finish with the remaining noodles and sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella.

8. Lightly oil a large piece of aluminum foil or coat it with nonstick cooking spray, and use it to tightly cover the dish. Bake the lasagna for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for about 15 minutes more, or until lightly browned and bubbling. Let stand for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
