      Title: Pat's Famous Pasta Sauce
 Categories: Cyberealm, Mom's best, Sauces
      Yield: 1 large pot!
 
MMMMM----------------------FROM: PAT FIELDS---------------------------

      4 qt Tomatoes
      1    30 oz jar Spaghetti Sauce
      1 cn 20 oz tomato sauce
      3 cn Tomato paste
      4 tb Italian seasoning
    1/2 ts Ground sage
      2 ts Garlic powder or salt
      1 tb Oregano
      1 ts Parsley
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Romano cheese, grated
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
 
  NOTE: It is best to use fresh canned tomatos and when you use the
  spaghetti sauce, the thicker the better (we use Prego).
  
  In a very LARGE pot, using a vegetable mill, grind tomatos to remove
  seeds and hard pulp. Pour the tomato sauce and spaghetti sauce in
  the mill, and process it.If the tomatos you added were watery, you
  might want to add a second jar/can of spaghetti sauce. Clean the jars
  out with water. The point you are trying to do is to retain as much
  of the essence of the ground whole tomatos as possible. Discard the
  debris. Add the tomato paste directly to the tomato mixture. (Note,
  clean the cans of paste as best as possible... you want them to be
  very clean.)
  
  Mix well. Salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Add all spices and the cheeses and mix well. Cover and place on very
  low heat. If you wish to add meatballs to the sauce while it is
  cooking now is the time to make them. Once made, add them directly to
  the sauce.
  
  As it cooks you may want to adjust the spices and the cheeses
  depending on your tastes. We add at least another tablespoon of
  oregano, 2 table- spoons of parsley, a little more salt, and at least
  another 1/2 cup each of romano and parmesan cheeses.
  
  Stir every half hour or so to prevent scortching on the bottom of the
  pot. When the sauce is cooked down to your taste (and the meatballs
  are done to your liking), remove from heat and let sit for 1/2 hour.

      Title: Pat's Famous Meatballs for his Famous Pasta Sauce
 Categories: Cyberealm, Mom's best, Italian, Meats
      Yield: 24 meatballs+
 
  4 1/2 lb Ground chuck or lean beef
      2    Eggs
      1 tb Garlic salt
      1 tb Italian seasoning
      3 c  Or more Italian bread crumbs
    3/4 c  Or more Grated Romano cheese
 
  In a very large bowl, add all ingredients except the cheese. The
  mixture will be very very dry (this is good, as the crumbs will ab-
  sorb any fats in the sauce!). Mix well. Add the cheese.
  
  Form meatballs to the size you desire and saute all sides until just
  brown. Drop in the sauce you are making.
  
  This recipe will make 24 +/- "larger than golf-ball size", or
  smaller, depending on your desires.

 Categories: Salads, Appetizers, Cyberealm
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 x  Head of Romaine Lettuce
      1 x  Tin of Anchovy Filets
      1 tb Fresh Ground Black Pepper
      4 cl Garlic
      1 x  Egg Yolk-use Extra Large Egg
      1 tb Prepared Hot Mustard
      3 ds Tobasco Sauce
      1 tb Worcestershire Sauce
    3/4 c  Olive Oil
           Red Wine Vinegar
      1 x  Lemon
           Fresh Grated Parmesan Cheese
           Croutons
    1/2 lb Bacon
 
  1) Cook the bacon until very crisp. Set aside and allow to drain on
  paper
     towels.
  
  2) Place egg in a glass of warm water and set aside until it reaches
  room
     temperature (10-15 minutes).
  
  3) Crush the garlic in a large wooden bowl. Add the anchovies and
  crush
     into a pulpy mass. Mix with black pepper.
  
  4) Add mustard, worcestershire sauce and tobasco. Separate the egg,
  keeping
     the yolk. If you can't find any extra large eggs then 2 small eggs
  is
     fine. Stir in each of these ingredients thoroughly as you add each
  one.
  
  5) SLOWLY add the oil from the anchovy tin, using a french whisk to
  mix.
  
  6) SLOWLY add olive oil, rapidly whipping until you get a thick
  paste. You
     may have to vary the amount of oil to achieve this (at least 3/4
  cup).
  
  7) Squeeze in some red wine vinegar to taste. Once around the bowl is
     usually enough.
  
  8) Squeeze in one lemon for the juice, again to taste.
  
  9) Just before serving, add the lettuce, croutons, crushed bacon and
     parmesan cheese. Toss Thoroughly.
  
  The trick to this is the dressing should be quite thick before adding
  the red wine vinegar and lemon juice.
  
  You may want to add more garlic, tobasco, worcestershire, mustard
  depending on how spicy you like your Caesar Salad.

      Title: Ariel's Peppercorn Steak (or Steak au Poivre)
 Categories: Main dish, Meats, Cyberealm
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  8 to 12 oz New York Sirloin
    1/4 c  Olive Oil
    1/4 c  Teriyaki Sauce
      2 tb Worcestershire Sauce
           Coarsley Crushed Peppercorns
           Red Wine
           Cream
           Cognac
 
  1) Combine olive oil, teriyakia and worcestershire sauces to form a
     marinade for the meat. Or, you may use a marinade recipe of your
     choice. Marinade the steak at least a few hours, or overnight in
  the
     fridge turning the meat occasionally.
  
  2) Crush enough peppercorns to cover the steak on both sides. Put the
     crushed peppercorns on a cutting board and press the steak onto the
     peppercorns to coat. Do the same for both sides of the steak.
  
  3) Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron with grill lines) and
  plop
     the steak into it. Depending on the meat and the marinade, you may
  have
     to add a bit of oil.
  
  4) Cook both sides evenly until the meat is medium rare, or to your
     liking.
  
  5) Put the meat on a heated plate. Keep the liquid in the skillet and
  add
     some wine to deglaze the skillet. (ie collect all the remains into
  a
     sauce). Cook (fairly high heat) until the sauce thickens, stirring
     occasionally.
  
  6) For more sauce, or Steak au Poivre la Creme, add cream and cook a
     little longer. Usually you need to do this to thicken the sauce.
  
  7) Add cognac, cook some more. Sauce should always be thick. Pour
  sauce
     over steak and optionally flambe in cognac (Steak au Poivre
  Flambe).
  
  Serve with Parisienne potatos and carrots.

      Title: Hashed Brown Potatoes
 Categories: Side dishes, Vegetables, Cyberealm
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 x  Large Yellow Onion, peeled.
      3 tb Butter or Bacon Drippings
      4 x  Large Potatoes, peeled.
    3/4 ts Salt
           Fresh Ground Black Pepper
 
  1) Chop the onion and potato into 1 inch chunks.
  
  2) Set up the food processor with the chopping blade and coarsely
  chop the
     onion using pulse mode. 3 or 4 pulses should do the job.
  
  3) Melt the butter in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat. Add
  the
     onion and allow to saute while you chop the potatoes.
  
  4) For best results, chop 1/4 of the potatoes at a time. Too many
  potatoes
     in the food processor could produce unevenly chopped potatoes. Put
  the
     potatoes in the work bowl and spread them around evenly before you
     chop. Use the pulse method about 4 times.
  
  5) Take out the batch of chopped potatoes and put them in the skillet
  with
     the onions. Do this for the remaining 3 batches of potatoes.
  
  6) Saute slowly for 10 minutes. Cover and turn the heat down as low as
     possible. Let the potatoes simmer for 10 minutes. This should cook
     them through.
  
  7) Remove the cover and turn the heat up to brown the potatoes. Stir
  them
     up from the bottom using a spatula. Sprinkle with salt and pepper
     before serving.

  sausage, crumbling, until completely done.  Add celery and onion and
  1/2 cup water to fry pan and let simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Using your roasting pan, empty 2 boxes of croutons into it. Add
  sausage/celery/onion mix.  Melt 1/2 cup butter and add.  Add tsp. of
  poultry seasoning.  Add 2 cups of giblet broth.  Stir well until
  croutons are evenly moistened.
  
  Rinse turkey again, shake out excess water.  Stuff body cavity with
  stuffing LOOSELY (do not pack in or turkey will explode.. stuffing
  expands when cooking!) and put legs back into retainer to hold
  together. Stuff neck cavity.  Fold wing tips behind bird's back, use
  to hold neck skin down so stuffing won't fall out from neck.
  
  Rinse out roasting pan and line with foil.  Coat foil with vegetable
  oil. Coat turkey, all over, with vegetable oil.  Place in roasting
  pan.
  
  Add any excess stuffing that will fit on top of turkey legs at body
  cavity opening, laying on top.
  
  Put in oven and roast for approx. 6 1/2 to 7 hours, depending on oven.
  Roast to 180ø to 185ø internal temperature at thickest part of thigh
  without touching thermometer to bone, and same at thickest part of the
  breast.
  
  Baste turkey with baster last 2 hours, about every 15 minutes. If
  skin is getting too dark, tent with foil.

      Title: Clyde's MeatLoaf
 Categories: Cyberealm, Mom's best, Meats
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 c  Old-fashioned oatmeal
    1/2 c  + 2 T honey
    1/2 c  Milk
      2 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 ts Minced garlic
           Salt and fresh pepper
  2 1/2 lb Ground chuck
    3/4 c  Grated carrots
    1/3 c  Ketchup
      1 ts Dry mustard
 
  1. Combine the oatmeal, honey and milk in a large mixing bowl. Allow
  to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375F.
  
  2. Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat and add the onion and
  garlic. Add salt and pepper to taste, and saute until the onion is
  translucent and softened slightly.
  
  3. Add the onion to the oatmeal mixture, along with the meat, add
  salt to taste, and plenty of black pepper. Add the grated carrots,
  mix thoroughly, and place in a non-stick 9 x 5 x 3 loaf pan. (If
  using a regular loaf pan, oil it lightly.) Place the loaf pan on
  a cookie sheet to catch any spills and put in oven. (Typist's note:
  I used a bundt pan and it works much better -- no boil over of
  grease).
  
  4. Bake the meatloaf for 50 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully
  tip the pan to drain off the excess fat and liquid, and then turn
  the meatloaf out onto the cookie sheet. Turn right side up. Combine
  the ketchup and mustard and spread the mixture over the top of the
  meatloaf. Return meatloaf to the oven and bake for an additional
  20 minutes.
