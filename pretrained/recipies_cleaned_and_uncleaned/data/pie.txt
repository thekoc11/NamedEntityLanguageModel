1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
5 tablespoon ice water
8 cup apples [peeled & sliced]
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour

in the water a little at a time, using a fork, and form the dough into a
ball.

2) Roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured board. Roll to an 11" or
12" diameter and fit into a 9" pie pan fluting the edges.

3) Combine the sugar, the second measure of flour, the cinnamon, the nutmeg
and the lemon juice in a large bowl then toss the apple slices in the
mixture and arrange them in the pie crust.

To make the topping: 4) Combine the sugar and flour in a bowl and cut in
the butter using a pastry cutter then sprinkle the topping over the apple
filling.

5) Place the pie in the LARGE paper bag and place the paper bag on a baking
sheet and loosely fold the open end of the bag under. Bake until the apples
are tender (50-60 minutes).

6) Carefully remove the pie from the bag ~ CAUTION: WATCH OUT FOR THE STEAM
COMING OUT OF THE BAG!

yolks and decrease the flour. for chocolate variations add some
baking cocoa or melted chocolate. For a tangy dough add some sour
cream, or grated cheese for a cheese pastry dough. blend in almonds

Amish Brown Sugar Pie

pies, pastries

1  unbaked 8 inch pie shell
1 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoon all purpose flour  speck of salt
1  12 oz can evaporated milk
2 1/2 tablespoon butter ground cinnamon

Preheat oven to 350 F.  In the pie shell, place the brown sugar, flour, and
salt.  Mix with your fingers.  Pour the evaporated milk over the flour and
sugar, but do not stir or mix this in.  Dot with butter, and drift cinnamon
liberally over all.  Bake for 50 min., or until the filling just bubbles up
in the middle. The filling will never completely set, but that's the way
it's supposed to be. This pie is better eaten at room temperature. If you
refrigerate leftovers, reheat them in the oven before serving. NOTE: Recipe
can be doubled and prepared in a 10 inch pie shell. For that size, bake 1
hour and 20 min.  (Yield: 12 servings)

Amish Peanut Butter Cream Pie

pies, pastries

3/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
1 cup sugar; divided
3 cup milk; divided
3  eggs; separated
6 tablespoon cornstarch; divided
3 tablespoon flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoon vanilla; divided
1  pie shell; baked
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar

Beat together the powdered sugar and peanut butter until the mixture is
crumbly; set aside. In a large, heavy saucepan, combine 2/3 c sugar and 2
cup milk; heat to scalding or until bubbles start to form on the bottom. Do
not let it boil.

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks to mix; blend in 3 T
cornstarch, flour and salt. Stir to make a paste. Whisk in the remaining 1
cup cold milk, whisking until the mixture is smooth. Pour in some of the
hot milk mixture, stirring to combine.

Add mixture in bowl to the milk in the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat,
stirring constantly, until the mixture bubbles up in the center. Add the
butter and 1 t vanilla. Remove from heat and let custard cool. Preheat oven
to 350 degrees. Sprinkle 2/3 of the crumbly peanut butter mixture in the
bottom of the baked (and cooled) pastry shell. Pour the cooled custard
mixture over the top.

In a large mixer bowl, place the egg whites, cream of tartar and remaining

Apple Crumb Pie

pies, pastries

4 cup apples, tart
2 tablespoon butter
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup flour, all-purpose
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup nuts, chopped (walnuts, pecans, etc; .)
1  pie crust

Core, peel and slice the apples.  Melt the butter and mix the rest in with
it. Pour over apples and mix around so the apples are coated. Put in an
unbaked pie shell.

Combine brown sugar, flour, melted butter and nuts.  Spread over top of the
filling.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 50 minutes, or until it is bubbling.

NOTES:

*  One-crust apple-crumb pie -- The pie can also be frozen and then baked,
right from the freezer, at 360 for 90 minutes.  The pies will keep a very
long time in the freezer and not be worse for wear.

*  PS:  For those who like the quality of home-made pie crusts but the
convenience of ready-made, make a bunch of crusts someday when the mood
grabs you, and put them in the freezer in a big plastic bag.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

2  vidalia onions, peeled and

3 tablespoon butter
1 cup water
1  chicken bouillon cube
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1  salt (to taste if apples
1  are tart)

Contributed to the echo by: Cheryl Johns Originally from "Sweet Vidalia
Onions - Blue Ribbon Recipes" Okay, folks, our favorite time of year has
come. The Vidalia onions have reached Virgina. I just bought a 10 pound bag
and a cookbook called Sweet Vidalia Onions - Blue Ribbon Recipes. I'll post
a few recipes tonight that I think look interesting. Remember I just got
the book tonight so I haven't tried any of them. Peel, core and slice
apples into 1/4 inch slices. Peel and thinly slice onions. Layer the onion
slices in a buttered 9 1/2 inch pyrex pie plate. Put a layer of apples on
onion slices, another layer of onions, ending with apples. Pour one cup of
bouillon over the layers, then sprinkle cracker crumbs on top. Drizzle
melted butter over the crumbs. Bake in oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes
or until top has browned.

Baklava (Layered Pastry With Walnuts & Honey Syrup)

pastries, deserts, greek

1  pastry:
3/4 lb butter; three 1/4 lb. sticks
1  ; cut into 1/4 inch pieces
1/2 cup vegetable oil
40 filo sheets; each about 16
1  ; inches long by 12 inches
1  ; wide
4 cup walnuts, shelled; pulverized
1  ; in a blender, nut grinde
1  ; or mortar/pestle
1  syrup:
1 1/2 cup sugar
3/4 cup water
1 tablespoon lemon juice, fresh
1 tablespoon honey

Clarify the butter in a heavy saucepan or skillet in the following
fashion:  Melt the butter slowly over low heat without letting it
brown, skimming off the foam as it rises to the surface.  Remove the
pan from the heat, let it rest for 2 or 3 minutes, then spoon off the
clear butter and discard the milky solids at the bottom of the pan.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and stir the vegetable oil into the
clarified butter.  Using a pastry brush coat the bottom and sides of
a 13 by 19 by 2   inch baking dish with about 1 tablespoon of the
mixture. Fold a sheet of filo in half crosswise, lift it up gently
and unfold it into the prepared dish.  Press the pastry flat, fold
down the excess around the sides and flatten it against the bottom.
Brush the entire surface of the pastry lightly with the butter and
oil mixture, and lay another sheet of filo on top, folding it down
and buttering it in a similar fashion. Sprinkle the pastry evenly
with about 3 tablespoons of walnuts. Repeat the same procedure using
two sheets of buttered filo and 3 tablespoons of the pulverized
walnuts each time to make 19 layers in all. Spread the 2 remaining
sheets of filo on top and brush the baklava with all of the remaining
butter and oil mixture. With a small, sharp knife score the top of
the pastry with parallel diagonal lines about   inch deep and 2
inches apart, then cross them diagonally to form diamond shapes.
Bake in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes.  Reduce the heat to
about 300 and bake for 45 minutes longer, or until the top is crisp
and golden brown.

Syrup:
Meanwhile, make the syrup.  Combine the sugar, water and lemon
juice in a small saucepan and, stirring constantly, cook over
moderate heat until the sugar dissolves.  Increase the heat to high
and, timing it from the moment the sugar boils, cook briskly,
uncovered, for about 5 minutes, or until the syrup reaches a
temperature of 220 on a candy thermometer. Remove the pan from the
heat and stir in the honey. Pour the syrup into a bowl or pitcher and
set aside. When the baklava is done, remove it from the oven and pour
the syrup over it.  Cool to room temperature, and just before
serving, cut the baklava into diamond shaped serving pieces.

used.) Chill for 30 minutes. Bake pastry at 375 degrees for 12 minutes
until light golden in color. Thinly slice five of the bananas and arrange
on bottom of pastry shell. Mash the remaining banana and combine with warm
cream, 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch and vanilla. Pour over banana layer. Bake
at 350 degrees for 35 - 40 minutes or until filling is set. Let pie cool
slightly. To make meringue, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft
peaks form. Gradually beat in 1/3 cup sugar until meringue is stiff and
glossy. Spread meringue over warm pie; bake at 350 degrees for 12 - 15
minutes or until browned. Let cool; refrigerate until serving time. Serves

Basic Crust I

pies, pastries

1 1/4 cup flour
1  pinch of salt
3 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon shortening
3  to 4 tb. cold water

Sift the flour and salt together into a bowl.  But the butter and
shortening into the flour with a pastry blender or two knives until the
mixture resembles course meal.  Add three Tb. water and mix with a fork and
then with your fingertips until the dough can be gathered into a ball.
If the dough is very crumbly, sprinkle a few drops of water over the
dough, adding only enough to make the dough stick together.  Wrap the dough
in wax paper and chill in the refriigerator one hour before rolling out.

ROLLING AND PRE-BAKING : Roll the dough out on a floured board and fit it
into a nine to ten inch quiche tin or nine inch pie plate. Cover the pastry
with a sheet of aluminum floil, pressing it firmly around the sides and
over the edges of the pastry.  Fill with uncooked rice or dry beans and
bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 7 minutes. Carefully remove the
rice or beans and aluminum foil. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork
and continue baking 5 minutes more. The crust should not brown but should
be only partially baked unless otherwise directed in a specific recipe. Let
the pastry cool before filling and baking the quiche or pie.

BIG BANANA CREAM PIE W/CARAMELIZED BANANAS &

fruits, pies, bananas

      ----CREAM PIE CRUST----
1 1/2 cup flour
1 pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
6 tablespoon unsalted butter; cold/cut up
3 tablespoon shortening; very cold
3 tablespoon ; ice water (or more)
      ----BANANA CREAM FILLING----
5 egg yolks
2 tablespoon flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
2/3 cup sugar
3 cup milk
3 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon banana liqueur
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
      ----CARAMELIZED FLAMED BANANAS----
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/4 cup light brown sugar
3 medium bananas; not too ripe
1 tablespoon banana liqueur
      ----BANANA WHIP CREAM----
2 cup cream
3 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon banana liqueur

FOR CRUST: Mix flour, salt and sugar. Cut in butter and shortening
until it looks like flaky meal. Sprinkle in ice water. Work into a
ball that cleans the sides of the mixing bowl. (To mix in a food
processor, place dry ingredients in work bowl, top with butter and
shortening, an pulse until mealy. With machine running, pour in the
ice water all at once. When dough forms a ball that knocks around the
sides of the machine, stop immediately.)

Flatten dough into a disk, then wrap with plastic wrap, and chill 30
minutes (or freeze).

Heat oven to 425 for a glass pie plate; 450 for metal. Roll dough to a
circle 3 to 4 inches wider than the pie plate. Set in plate and cut
overhang with scissors so dough extends 3/4 inch beyond the rim. Fold
overhang under so it is even with plate's rim and crimp large flutes.
Prick the bottom and sides all over with a fork, about 50 times.
Cover bottom with foil, fill with rice or beans, and bake 15 minutes.
Pour off grains and foil and return crust to oven to bake 5 to 10
minutes more. Crust should be pale.

FOR FILLING: Stir yolks and set bowl in a place convenient to the
stove.

In a heavy saucepan, whisk flour, cornstarch, sugar, and milk until
free of lumps. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil,
stirring constantly. Boil for 2 minutes, stirring fast and getting
into the corners of the pot.

Remove from heat and whisk a little of the milk into the egg yolks,
then pour the tempered yolks into the hot milk. Continue to cook
another FULL 2 minutes, stirring constantly. If lumps form, strain
into a bowl.

Pour into a bowl and add butter, banana liqueur, and vanilla,
stirring to cool. Press plastic wrap onto surface to prevent a skin
from forming. Set filling aside while you prepare the bananas.

FOR CARAMALIZED BANANAS: Place butter and brown sugar in large
skillet; slice in the bananas. Heat over medium-high heat until
butter melts and sugar begins to caramelize, about 3 minutes. Don't
over-mush the bananas. Shake the pan to distribute bananas instead of
bruising them with a tool. (If you must use a tool, use a rubber
spatula.) With heat high, pour in liqueur all at once. Ignite with a
match and let flame subside by itself. Pour bananas onto a jelly-roll
pan to cool quickly.

TO ASSEMBLE: Line the baked pie shell with cooled bananas. Top with
filling (which may still be warm). Wrap pie in plastic and
refrigerate until filling sets, about 6 hours.

In a cold bowl, with cold beaters, whip the cream, sugar, and liqueur
to stiff peaks. Pipe from a pastry bag fitted with a large
star-shaped tip with a wide opening. You will have lots of whipped
cream, so the designs can be big, even garish. Make rows, rounds,
mounds, or swirls. Chill again, and keep cold until serving.

To slice wedges, use a smooth knife dipped in a tall glass of hot
water, then wiped dry.

Blueberry Lemon Souffle Pie

pies

3 cup blueberries, picked over
6 tablespoon granulated sugar
3 large eggs, separated
7 tablespoon superfine sugar
1/4 cup (plus 3 tb) fresh lemon
1  juice
1 grated zest of 2 lemons
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 baked pie shell

Preheat oven to 400F.  In a nonreactive saucepan, toss the
blueberries and granulated sugar.  Cook over moderately high heat,
stirring occasionally, until the juices begin to bubble, 3-5 minutes;
do not overcook or the berries will burst.  Pour into a stainless
steel strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the drained juices. Using an
electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 4 tablespoons of the
superfine sugar until pale and thick, about 2 minutes.  Gradually
beat in the lemon juice and then the zest. Transfer the mixture to a
nonreactive saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring, until it
thickens, about 8 minutes; do not boil. Scrape into a bowl and set
aside on a rack to cool. Using clean beaters, beat the egg whites
until foamy. Add the salt and beat until soft peaks form. Add the
remaining 3 tablespoons superfine sugar, 1/2 tablespoon at a time,
beating well after each addition. Beat at high speed until the whites
are glossy but not dry, about 20 seconds longer. Using a rubber
spatula, stir one-fourth of the beaten whites into the yolk mixture.
Gently fold in the remaining whites in three additions. Spoon the
blueberries into the pie shell and drizzle 2 1/2 tablespoons of the
drained juices over them.  Mound the souffle mixture over the
berries, touching the pie crust all around. Bake in the middle of the
oven for about 15 minutes, until the top is nicely browned. Transfer
the pie to a rack to cool slightly.  Serve at warm or at room
temperature.

1 text only

I've never even tasted a blueberry, but this looks like a good
introduction...

For the pastry, cut 125 g softened mono-unsaturated margarine into
250 g flour.  Add up to 70 ml cold water, roll the dough into a ball
and leave in a cool place to rest for 15 minutes.

Butter and lightly flour a 25 cm tall tin with a removable base. Roll
out the pastry and line the tin. Mix 20 g flour with 100 g caster
sugar and spread it over the bottom of the pastry case. Fill the case
with 750 g blueberries and dot them with a total of 30 g of
margarine. Bake in a preheated 240C oven for 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove from oven, dust with 50 g icing sugar.  Serve warm.

Border Tart

pies, pastries, uk

1  **  british measurements  **
      ----THE PASTRY----
6 oz flour
3 oz butter or margarine
1 oz caster sugar
1  egg yolk
      ----THE CUSTARD----
1 tablespoon cornflour
1/2 oz butter
5 oz milk
1  egg yolk
1 oz caster sugar
2 drop vanilla essence
      ----THE FILLING----
4 oz marzipan
1 oz almonds; flaked
1 oz mixed peel; chopped

The original recipe for this rich tart called for a yeasty pastry into
which was folded butter. As with the Selkirk Bannock the dough for this
would have been a portion from the weekly bread making. Nowadays a rich
shortcrust pastry is used.

To make the pastry: Rub the butter into the flour, stir in the sugar and
bind the mixture to make a firm dough. Line an 8-inch flan ring and reserve
the extra dough for decoration.

To make the custard: Blend the cornflour with a little milk and stir in the
remaining milk and sugar. Heat gently until it boils and simmer for a
couple of moments before removing from the heat. Stir in the butter and let
the custard cool a little before stirring in the egg yolk and vanilla
essence. Leave it to cool.

To make the filling: Roll the marzipan to fit the base of the pastry.
Sprinkle over the almonds and peel. Spread the cooled custard over this.
Using the left over rolled pastry, cut circles of about 1-inch in diameter
and arrange these in a pattern on top of the custard.

Cover with a circle of greaseproof paper to prevent burning the custard and
bake for 20 minutes at 400øF / 200øC / gas mark 6 and then for a further 20
minutes in a slower oven, 350øF / 180øC / gas mark 4.

Decorate by combining 1 ounce icing sugar with a little warm water and
spreading over the pastry circles. Serve either hot and cold.

This is a very rich tart and I find the iced pastry circles detract from
the otherwise subtle splendour of this treat. Even a latticed decoration
seems to heavy for modern tastes. Try a very light shake of nutmeg or
cinnamon or decorate with a few flaked almonds instead. ** Scottish Home

Butterscotch Banana Pie Bayona *Jb

pies, deserts, bananas

      ----FILLING----
1 1/4 cup milk
2 large egg yolks
1 large whole egg
3 tablespoon cornstarch
3 tablespoon firmly packed brown sugar
2 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoon cold water
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1 1/3 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon scotch  (up to 3)
1/4 teaspoon salt
3  firm-ripe bananas
      ----DOUGH----
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4  stick (6 tablespoons) cold unsalted; butter, cut into bits
2 tablespoon cold vegetable shortening
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon ice water  (up to 4)

Make pastry dough: In a bowl with a pastry blender or in a food
processor blend or pulse together flour, butter, shortening, and salt
until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2 tablespoons ice water and
toss with a fork or pulse until water is incorporated. Add enough
remaining ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing or pulsing to
incorporate, until mixture begins to form a dough. On a work surface
smear dough in 3 or 4 forward motions with heel of hand to slightly
develop gluten in flour and make dough easier to work with. Form
dough into a ball and flatten to form a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in
plastic wrap, 1 hour. Makes enough dough for a single-crust 9- to
10-inch pie.

Make pie: On a lightly floured surface roll out dough into an 11-inch
round (about 1/8 inch thick) and fit into a 9-inch (1-quart) metal
pie plate, crimping edge decoratively. Prick shell all over with a
fork and chill 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line shell with
foil and fill with pie weights or beans. Bake shell in middle of oven
15 minutes. Carefully remove foil and pie weights or beans and bake
shell 5 minutes more, or until pale golden. Cool shell on a rack. In
a large heavy saucepan bring milk just to a boil and remove pan from
heat. In a large heatproof bowl whisk together yolks, whole egg,
cornstarch, and brown sugar until combined well. Gradually whisk in
hot milk and pour mixture into pan. Cook mixture over moderately high
heat, whisking constantly, until it just comes to a boil and is
thickened. Remove pastry cream from heat and, scraping with a
spatula, force through a fine sieve set over another large heatproof
bowl. Whisk in butter until incorporated. In a very small saucepan
sprinkle gelatin over water and let stand about 1 minute to soften.
Heat gelatin mixture over low heat until gelatin is dissolved. Stir
gelatin mixture into pastry cream and cool. In a dry heavy saucepan
cook granulated sugar over moderate heat, without stirring, until it
begins to melt. Continue cooking sugar, stirring with a fork, until
melted and swirl pan until caramel is a deep golden. Remove pan from
heat and carefully add 1/3 cup heavy cream down side of pan (caramel
will bubble up and steam). Return pan to heat and simmer, stirring,
until caramel is dissolved. Stir in vanilla, Scotch, and salt until
combined and cool sauce. Stir sauce into pastry cream until combined
well. In a bowl beat 1/2 cup remaining heavy cream until it just
holds stiff peaks and fold into pastry cream. Cut 2 bananas into
1/4-inch slices and fold into pastry cream. Pour filling into shell
and chill, covered loosely, 4 hours or overnight. Beat remaining 1/2
cup heavy cream until it just holds stiff peaks and spread on pie.
Cut remaining banana into 1/4-inch slices and arrange decoratively on
pie.

Caribou Mincemeat Pie

pies, game, caribou

2 cup apple cider
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup dried currants
1 1/2 cup apples; peeled and chopped
1/4 lb ground caribou meat
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 cup brandy or dark rum
1  pastry recipe

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, combine cider, raisins, and currants.
Cover and heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to low and
simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add apples, caribou,
cinnamon, cloves, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and allspice. Simmer 2 hours
longer. Add water as necessary to keep mincemeat from sticking to
saucepan. Cool mincemeat to room temperature, add the liquor and let
sit at least overnight before making pies.

Mincemeat can be kept in a cool place in a stone crock for 2 weeks,
canned or frozen. If frozen, thaw mincemeat before making pie.

Prepare pastry and refrigerate until ready to use-at least 30
minutes. Heat oven to 350'F. Divide pastry; roll out bottom crust and
roll out and cut strips for a top lattice. Carefully spoon mincemeat
into crust-lined pie plate. Place pastry strips one at a time across
mincemeat to create a woven grid. Lift edge of bottom crust over ends
of strips. Pinch together and flute edge. Bake pie 50 to 55 minutes
or until crust is lightly browned and filling bubbles. Cool 10
minutes on wire rack before cutting.

Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.

Chart House Mud Pie

pies, deserts

1/2 pkg nabisco chocolate wafers
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 quart coffee ice cream
1 1/2 cup fudge sauce

Crush wafers and add butter, mix well.  Press into 9" pie plate.
Cover with soft coffee ice cream. Put into freezer until ice cream is
firm. Top with cold fudge sauce (it helps to place in freezer for a
time to make spreading easier).  Store in freezer approximately 10
hours.

Presentation: Slice mud pie into eight portions and serve on a chilled
dessert plate with a chilled fork. Top with whipped cream and slivered
almonds.

Gaye's Notes:  I first had mud pie on my honeymoon in

Honolulu in 1975. The Chart House was kind enough to share this
fabulous (and easy!) recipe with us.

Cherry Cheese Pizza

fruits, pies, pizza

1  recipe 9-inch double crust pastry
8 oz cream cheese (1 package)
1/2 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1/3 cup walnuts, chopped
1 teaspoon vanilla
42 oz tart cherry pie filling (2 cans)

Here is an adaption of the old fashioned pizza.  I know that it uses a
canned pie filling, but you can also use your own pie filling. The
canned is only used for speed.

Roll out the pastry and put on a 16 inch pizza pan. Bake 15 minutes
at 350 degrees F.  Blend the cream cheese, sugar, eggs, walnuts and
vanilla together until well blended. Pour into the pie crust and bake
an additional 10 minutes.  Cool until cold and top with the cherry
pie filling. Top with whipped cream, if desired.

Cherry Cream Cheese Pie

pies, pastries

1  pie shell (graham cracker)
8 oz cream cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla (or to taste)
4 oz whipped cream
14 oz cherry pie filling (1 can)

Cream together the cheese and sour cream.  Fold in sugar gradually. Add
vanilla and mix well.  Fold in whipped cream.  Pour into pie shell and
chill for at least 3 hours.

Pour excess syrup from the can of cherry pie filling.  Leave some, but you
certainly don't need all of it.  The sauce should cover the cream cheese
mix, but the cherries shouldn't be drowning in it. Pour pie filling on top.
Serve cold.

NOTES:

*  A simple cherry cream cheese pie -- My wife makes this for me
periodically, and it is always delicious. No baking is required, and it is
very easy to make. Yield: Makes one pie.

*  If you don't have the time to sit around for 3 hours waiting for the pie
to chill, make the cream cheese filling the night before and let the pie
chill overnight.

*  We prefer to use non-dairy whipped cream substitute.  We usually use the
same brand name ingredients for best results:  Philadelphia cream cheese,
Breakstone's sour cream, Cool-whip and Comstock cherry pie filling.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours chilling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK, especially with the vanilla.

Chez Panisse Pastry Crust

pies

2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
3/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon sugar
5 tablespoon cold salted butter
6 1/2 tablespoon cold unsalted butter
3 tablespoon vegetable shortening
3 tablespoon ice water; plus
1 teaspoon ice water

This is a good basic pie crust recipe from Lindsey Shere at Chez
Panisse. It is flaky and has a good butter flavor.

MIX THE FLOUR, SALT AND SUGAR in a bowl. Cut the salted butter in
pieces 1/3-inch thick and quickly cut them into the flour mixture
until it is the texture of cornmeal. You can do this with a pastry
blender, with your hands by rubbing quickly and lightly between your
fingers, or in an electric mixer or food processor. Cut in the
unsalted butter and the vegetable shortening until they are in larger
pieces, about 1/8- to 1/4-inch in diameter. This helps to make the
dough flaky. Sprinkle in the 3 tablespoons ice water, tossing the
dough lightly with a fork to moisten it evenly. Use another teaspoon
of water if necessary to make the dough hold together. Stir the dough
with the fork until it has come together in small lumps and there is
no dry flour left. Divide the dough in half and press it into two
balls. Be careful not to knead it--just squeeze it together. Kneading
activates the gluten, which makes the dough tough. However, if the
dough is crumbly, knead it together very briefly. Wrap tightly in
plastic and chill for at least 4 hours. During this time, the enzymes
in the flour will mellow the gluten to permit the water to be
absorbed completely; this conditioning will help to prevent shrinkage
and toughness later. Makes enough for two 9-inch pie shells.

Classical Puff Pastry

breads, pastries, baking

1  3  1/2 c  all-purpose flour
1  1  1/2 ts salt
1 lb unsalted butter, cold
1 1/4 cup ice water

Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor and
process few seconds to combine.  Cut 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of the
butter into small pieces and process with the flour until there are
no lumps and the mixture is the texture of cornmeal.

Pour half the ice water in a large bowl and turn the flour mixture
onto it. Sprinkle the remaining water over it, reserving one
tablespoon. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl, drizzle the
ice water evenly over it and toss like a salad until the dough comes
together in a ragged mass. Add the remaining water if necessary.
Cover in plastic wrap and chill.

Meanwhile, place the remaining butter between layers of plastic wrap
and pound with a rolling pin to make malleable.  Place it between two
sheets of plastic wrap and, using your hands or a rolling pin, shape
it into a 6-inch square.

Remove the dough from the fridge, lightly flour the work surface and,
using either your hands or a rolling pin, shape the mass into 12-inch
square. Place the butter on the dough catty-corner and fold the edges
of the dough into the center to enclose it.

Lightly flour the surface of the dough and roll it into a rectangle
measuring about 12 inches high x 26 inches wide.  If the dough sticks,
loosen it underneath with a long flexible metal palette knife and
scrape off any butter sticking to the work surface.  Brush off any
excess flour. Fold the dough into thirds and turn it 90 degrees, so
that seams are parallel to the table's edge.  This is called a
"turn". Lightly flour and roll it out again to about 12 x 26 inches.
Brush off the excess flour and again fold it into thirds. Place the
dough on a sheet tray, cover it with a plastic bag and refrigerate
for 20 to 30 minutes.

Repeat this, giving the dough two more turns, each time rolling it
out to 12 x 26 inches.  Refrigerate for another 20 or 30 minutes,
then give the dough 2 final turns.  There are six turns in all.

Lightly roll it to flatten and even it.  Wrap it in plastic wrap or a
bag and chill for at least two hours before using it.  It can be kept,
refrigerated, for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.

Yield:  2- 3/4 pounds of dough

To roll pastry:  (for home size 11 x 17-inch sheet trays)

For thinly rolled dough (1/16-inch) used to make little pizzas start
with 15 ounces (1/3 of the recipe).  For thickly rolled dough
(3/8-inch) used for everything else, start with 22 ounces (1/2
recipe).

Line an 11 x 17-inch sheet tray with parchment paper.  On a floured
table, roll the rectangle of dough to a length of 15 inches and a
width of 10 inches.  Dust off any excess flour.  Roll the dough up
onto the rolling pin and transfer it to the sheet tray.  Using a
10-inch rolling pin and rolling gently from the center out, roll the
dough to fit the tray. Make sure it is even - with no lumpy edges.
Rolling lightly and gently enables you to keep it even.

Shapes to cut out of the 3/8-inch thick dough:

Bouchee:  Cut 2 (3-1/2-inch) rounds of dough.  Cut a 2-1/4-inch
circle out of the second round.  Egg wash the first round.  Place the
ring from the second round over the first so that the edges line up.
Dock the edges and center with a fork.  Thin inner circle can be
baked as well and used for a lid.

Bouchee made from special cutter:  Use and cutter made especially for
this purpose.  It has two cutting edges - one inside and shorter than
the other that scores, rather than cuts the dough.

Criss-cross Tartlet:  Cut a 5-inch square.  Fold it into a triangle
and cut from each edge towards the apex, stopping about 1/2-inch
short of the apex. The cut should be about 1/2-inch from the edge.
Open it up to the square and place on a cookie sheet.  Egg wash the
edges. Bring one point over to the opposite corner of the inner
square and press. Bring the opposite point over and press.  Press
along the rim to seal. Dock rim and center.

Puff Strip:  From a sheet tray of frozen dough, cut a rectangular
piece 8" wide and the length of the sheet tray.  Transfer it to a
paper lined cookie sheet.  Using a pizza wheel, cut a 3/4" strip from
each edge. Egg wash the edges of the center piece and flip the cut
strips onto the egg washed edge. Dock the 2 rims with a fork, then
dock down the center.

Vol-au-Vent:  Similar to above, but round.  Press whatever size round
you want into the dough on the sheet tray.  Lift and cut along the
circular impression with a pizza wheel.  Center another round, and
inch or so smaller in diameter than the first over the circle of
dough and press lightly.  Remove and cut along this line.  Egg was
the edge, as above, and cut through the outer rim in one place. Place
the rim over the center circle, lining up the edges.  Dock the rim
with a fork, then dock the center.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes in a
preheated 425 degree F. oven.

3 1/2 tablespoon unsweetened alkalized; cocoa, sifted
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  cocoa; for garnish

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT: Six 4 1/2-inch fluted tartlette pans with removable
bottoms.
Make the cocoa almond crust: Position a rack in the center of the oven and
preheat to 350 degrees F. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the
metal chopping blade, place the flour, sugar, almonds, cocoa powder and
salt. Process the dry ingredien for 30 to 45 seconds, until the almonds are
coarsely chopped. Add the butte pieces and the vanilla to the bowl and
pulse the mixture 5 or 6 times until incorporated but still crumbly. Add
the ice water and pulse a few more time to form a dough.
Divide the dough mixture (it will still be crumbly) among six 4 1/2 inch
tartlette pans with removable bottoms. Using your fingertips, press the dou
into the bottom and up the sides of each pan. Place the tartlette pans on a
baking sheet; place the sheet in the freezer for 45 minutes.
Remove the tartlette shells from the freezer. Cover the pans with a sheet
aluminum foil, pressing the foil against the bottom and sides of each pan.
Fill each pan, over the foil, with ceramic pie weights or dried beans. Bake
the tartlette shells for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and weights. Return th
shells to the oven and hake an additional 10 minutes. Cool the tartlette
shells on a wire rack completely.

Transfer the chocolate to a medium bowl.

In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a gentle boil. Pour the hot cream
over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to melt the
chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Stir in the almond extract. Remove 1
Fill the cocoa clouds: Using a hand-held electric mixer set at medium
speed, heat the reserved 1 1 cups filling for 1 to 2 minutes until light in
color and fluffy. Scrape the unwhipped filling onto the tartlette shells,
dividing it evenly. Use a smal metal cake spatula to smooth the filling
into an even layer in the bottom o each shell. Scrape the whipped mixture
over this filling, dividing it evenl and smoothing it into an even layer on
each shell.
Make the cocoa cream: In a chilled, medium bowl, stir together the cream,
sugar, cocoa and vanill (the mixture will not be cohesive). Using a
hand-held electric mixer set at medium-high speed, beat the mixture until
stiff peaks just start to form. Cover and refrigerate the cocoa cream until
up to two hours before serving Garnish the cocoa clouds: Remove the
tartlettes from the pans. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip
(such as Ateco #5) with the cocoa cream. Pipe the cream in a shell pattern
over the filling on each tartlette, covering it completely. Place e
refrigerate for up to 2 hours before serving.

Coconut-Lime Pie

pies

1  coconut-graham-cracker
1  piecrust
      Filling-----
1 1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoon cold water
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 1/2 cup milk
2 large eggs, yolks only
1 1/2 teaspoon lime zest
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup coconut cream, not coconut
1  milk
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup whipping cream, heavy
      Coconut Cream----
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup cream of coconut
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
      Garnish----
1  toasted coconut

1. Prepare piecrust. Cool completely.

2. Filling: Sprinkle water over gelatin in a cup. Let stand at least 2
minutes to soften.

3. Whisk cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the milk in a 1-quart
microwave-safe measuring cup or bowl until smooth. Whisk in egg
yolks, 1 teaspoon of the lime peel and the salt. Whisk in remaining 1
1/4 cups milk and the cream of coconut until blended.

4. Microwave on high 3 minutes. Whisk until smooth. Microwave 3 1/2
to 7 1/2 minutes longer, whisking every 2 minutes, until boiling,
thickened and smooth. Immediately stir in softened gelatin and
continue stirring until gelatin dissolves (you'll see it liquefy).

5. Stir mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium-size bowl
(not aluminum). Stir in remaining 1/2 teaspoon lime peel and the lime
juice.

6. Set bowl in a larger bowl half-filled with ice water. Stir mixture
and scrape down sides of bowl often, 5 to 10 minutes, until cool and
thick enough to fall in soft mounds. Stir in vanilla. Remove bowl
from ice-water bath.

7. Beat cream with electric mixer until soft peaks form when beaters
are lifted. Gently stir into filling just until blended.

8. Spread filling in piecrust. Cover surface of filling with plastic
wrap (to keep a skin from forming) and refrigerate at least 2 hours
until set or up to 3 days.

9. Coconut Cream: Up to 1 hour before serving, beat heavy cream,
cream of coconut and vanilla in a medium-size bowl until stiff peaks
form. Pipe a lattice design on filling, then a border around edge of
pie (using a pastry bag fitted with a star tip) or spread cream on
filling. Sprinkle with coconut, if desired. Refrigerate until ready
to serve.

Coffee Toffee Pie

pies

      ----CRUST----
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup finely chopped walnuts or pecans
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 oz bittersweet chocolate, finely chopp; ed
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup unsalted butter, room temp
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon cold water (or more)
      ----FILLING----
2 oz bittersweet chocolate
1 tablespoon instant coffee
3/4 cup unsalted butter, room temp
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3  eggs
      ----TOPPING----
2 tablespoon instant coffee
2 cup whipping cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon coffee liqueur, such as kahlua or t; ia maria
1/4 cup sifted icing sugar

1. To make crust, preheat oven to 350F (180C). Lightly butter a
10-inch (25-cm) springform pan. Cut waxed paper to fit bottom. Brush
or rub with butter, then place butter-side up in pan. Using a fork,
stir flour with chopped nuts, sugar, chopped chocolate and salt in a
large mixing bowl Then, stir in butter and vanilla. Add 2 tb water
and mix until crumbly. If mixture seems dry, stir in remaining 1 tb
water. Turn into a lined springform pan. Press into bottom and
halfway up sides. Bake in centre of pre-heated oven until set and
edges are just starting to brown, about 18 to 20 minutes. Cool on a
rack. Do not remove sides.

2. To make filling, cut chocolate into coarse pieces, To make on top
of stove, place chocolate and instant coffee in a small heavy-bottomed
saucepan set over very low heat. Melt, stirring frequently, and
remove from heat when small pieces of chocolate are still visible,
about 5 minutes. Then, stir until smooth. Or, place chocolate and
instant coffee in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, without stirring,
on medium until chocolate is almost but not completely melted, about
2 minutes. Stir until smooth, then cool at room temperature while
continuing with recipe.

3. In a mixing bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer or wooden
spoon until very creamy. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and
lemon-colored. Beat in cooled chocolate mixture until combined. Then,
beat in eggs, 1 by 1, beating well after each addition. Pour into
cooled crust, cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour or up
to 1 day (any longer and crust becomes soggy).

4. Because whipped cream does not hold well, plan to add topping no
more than 2 hours before serving, To make topping, stir instant
coffee with cream, vanilla and liqueur, if desired, in a medium-size
mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat until soft peaks form when
beaters are lifted. Gradually beat in icing sugar. Spoon on top of
pie, then use a spoon to mound over filling and swirl surface of
cream. Top with chocolate curls or chopped chocolate, if you wish.
Serve fight away or refrigerate for up to 2 hours. Gently remove
sides from pan. Serve pie chilled on the same day it is made.

Cookie Crumb Crust For Unbaked Pie

pies

1 1/2 cup cookie crumbs
1/3 cup sugar; up to 1/2 cup
1/3 cup butter; up to 1/2 cup,melted

To quote the author, "Try this with graham wafers, gingersnaps,
vanilla wafers, chocolate wafers - very finely crumbled. It's quick,
easy and has more flavour than pastry." (Anne's note, use with a
precooked filling that is poured into a pie crust; ie, some chocolate
pies." Combine the crumbs with the sugar and melted butter. Press the
mixture firmly against the bottom and sides of a pie plate, using the
back of a spoon. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes at 300F.

Corey's Lemon Pie

pies, pastries

2  lemons, juiced
1  lemon rind, grated
2 tablespoon corn starch
3  eggs, separated
1 1/2 cup sugar
3 tablespoon flour
1 teaspoon butter or margarine
2 cup boiling water

Sift flour, corn starch, and sugar into a saucepan.  Add butter.  Add the
lemon juice to the egg yolks and beat with a rotary egg beater until they
are thick and velvety.  Add this to the sugar, corn starch, butter and
flour mixture and stir until free from lumps.  You may need to add a few
tablespoons of cold water to make thin enough not to lump. Pour the boiling
water over lemon mixture.  Set on the stove and let come to a boil,
stirring constantly.  And here is a secret; Your pie will have a better
flavor if it scorches just a tiny bit. Add grated lemon rind.

Let cool, stirring often.  Pour into pie shell, and add meringue.  Do not
flatten the meringue, but let it stand in peaks.  Brown slightly.

1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup raisins
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1  pastry for a 9-inch
1  double-crust pie
1 tablespoon milk
1 teaspoon granulated sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium bowl, beat the eggs.
Beat in the sugar, sour cream, cinnamon, salt and cloves. Stir in the
raisins and flour.  Roll out the bottom crust to fit a 9-inch pie
plate. Ease into the pie plate; trim even with the edge. Pour the
raisin mixture into the pastry-lined plate. Roll out the top crust
and arrange over the filling. Seal and flute the edge.  Brush the top
of the pie with milk; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Cut slits so
that steam can escape. Cover the edge of the pie with foil. Bake for
25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 20 to 25 minutes more, or
until the pastry is golden and the filling is bubbly.

Crab & Asparagus Quiche

pies, seafood, shellfish

1  8 pate brisee or regular pie crust
1 cup crab meat, chopped
1 3/4 cup milk, scalded
3  eggs, beaten
10  asparagus spears, tips reserved
4 oz parmesan cheese
1 dash nutmeg and cayenne pepper
1  salt to taste

Preheat oven to 375. Place crab meat in bottom of pastry shell. Cut
bottom parts of asparagus spears into half-inch slices and scatter
over crab. Scatter parmesan over asparagus. Beat eggs and milk
together, and season to taste with nutmeg, cayenne and salt. Pour
over crab/asparagus mixture. Arrange reserved asparagus tips in a
spoke-like pattern on top. Bake in preheated oven until set (about 45
minutes to an hour). Let sit for about 15 minutes before serving.
Next time, I might substitute Swiss cheese for at least part of the
Parmesan (didn't have any handy, and at 1 ayem, wasn't gonna make a
run to Kroger to get any).

Crazy-Crust Apple Pie

fruits, pies, deserts

      ----DOUGH----
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt (or less)
1 dash nutmeg
1 tablespoon sugar
9 oz flour (1 cup plus 2 tbsp.)
5 tablespoon unsalted butter
1  egg (room temperature is better)
2/3 cup water (room temperature or warm)
      ----FILLING----
1 tablespoon lemon juice
5  apples, medium-large
1/3 cup sugar
7 teaspoon flour (2 tbsp. plus 1 tsp)
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 dash cloves
1 pinch allspice
1 tablespoon dark molasses

Very lightly grease one 8- or 9-inch pie pan.

To prepare dough: Melt the butter. While it is melting, combine the
baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and sugar in a medium-sized bowl. Make
sure to kill any baking powder lumps. Add the flour to the other dry
ingredients, and mix very well to create a homogeneous mixture.

Add the melted butter to the dry ingredients, and blend well. Add the
egg (beat the egg separately first, if you like), and blend well.
Gradually add the warm water, in three or four batches, incorporating
each bit of water before adding more.

Mix well. You should end up with a smooth light-yellow liquid -- much
thinner than you would expect batter to be. Pour the batter into the
pie pan, and refrigerate it while you go on ...

To prepare filling

Start preheating the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 Centigrade)
Put the lemon juice into a medium-large bowl. Peel and core the
apples. Cut each apple into 16 wedges (approximately) and then cut
each wedge in half to make chunks. As you prepare the apples, place
the chunks into the large bowl and toss them with the lemon juice, to
reduce browning. After all the apples are cut, sprinkle the other
ingredients *except the molasses* into the bowl, and mix well to
blend and coat the apples.

To assemble pie Remove the pie pan with batter from refrigerator. (The
batter will have firmed considerably.) Spoon the apples into a mound
on top of the batter. The apples should extend just about to the
edges of the pie plate, but be heaped higher in the middle. If any
liquid is left behind in the filling bowl, pour it on. Drizzle the
tablespoon of molasses on top of the apples.

Bake at 400 Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes, or until the crust,
where it puffs up around the edges between the apple chunks, is
golden tan, and an apple chunk, stabbed with a fork, feels
appropriately soft (but still *al dente*).

Try to let it cool somewhat before cutting and eating.

Notes

I like a mix of apples -- Granny Smith, Rome, Paula Red, Empire....
(Although not Macintosh, as they cook into mush.) Depending on the
apples, you may want to modify the amounts of lemon juice and sugar
in the filling.

Changes to the spices are good too -- like slivers of candied ginger
in the filling.

      ----GINGERSNAP CRUST----
1  non-stick cooking spray
1 1/2 cup gingersnap crumbs
1  .  about 18 cookies crushed
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 large egg white; slightly beaten
      ----FILLING----
1 can pumpkin; 16oz   *or*
1  .  2 cups pureed pumpkin
1/2 cup brown sugar; packed
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

1 large egg; slightly beaten
2 large egg whites; slightly beaten
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup crystallized ginger; finely
1  .  chopped
1  fresh fruit for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350ø.  Spray a 9-in pie plate with non-stick
cooking spray.  Set aside.

Mix cookie crumbs with the cinnamon and about 2 Tbsp of the egg white
in a small bowl, crumbling the mixture together with your fingers
until crumbs are moistened but not soggy or sticky (add a few more
drops of egg white if needed). Turn the mixture into the prepared pie
plate, then press it into the bottom and up the sides of the plate.
Bake the crust for 8 minutes, then raise the oven temperature to 400ø.

While the crust bakes, whisk all of the filling ingredients together
in a large mixing bowl. To avoid spills, pour the mixture into the
crust while still on the oven shelf.

Bake 45 minutes, or until the filling is set but still slightly
wobbly in the center. Remove from oven and sprinkle with crystallized
ginger, if using. Cool pie to room temperature. Garnish with fresh
fruit, if you like. Makes 8 servings.

Crumb Or Streusel Topping

pies

1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup flour; up to 1/2 cup
1/4 cup butter; up to 1/2
1/4 cup nuts; chopped; opt -or- coconut
1/4 cup oats, rolled; opt

To quote the author, "If you use pat-in pastry to make a pie, you
won't have a top crust. A crumb topping is a great substitute. Golden
and crumbly, it looks irresistible, has a warm, buttery flavour, and
is easy to make. It can used to make with any fruit pie and some
others as well."

Blend the sugar, flour and butter until crumbly, then add nuts.
Sprinkle evenly over pie filling in the pie shell and bake as your
recipe directs. If the crust topping starts browning before the
filling is baked, put a piece of foil over it.

Crunchy Sweet Potato Pie

pies

1 1/2 lb sweet potatoes
1/2 cup almond brickle bits
2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoon butter, sweet; chilled
1/3 cup crisco; chilled
4 tablespoon ; water, ice
1 1/2 cup half-and-half
4 large egg
1/4 cup dark rum
1/3 cup sugar, brown, dark; packed
1/3 cup sugar, white
1/4 cup butter; melted
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, ground
1/8 teaspoon mace
1/3 cup almond brickle bits
1/4 cup almonds, sliced
1  whipping cream; (garnish)

Bake scrubbed sweet potatoes at 350 F. for about one hour or until
soft. Peel and mash.  This should yield
2 1/2    cups.

Put 1/2 cup brickle bits in a spice grinder or food processor and
process until finely crushed.  Combine with flour and salt in a bowl.
Cut in the butter and shortening until coarse crumbs form. Stir in
enough ice water to make a dough.  Chill 30 minutes.

Roll 2/3 of the dough into an 11" circle.  Fit into a 9" pie plate
and trim the edges.  Use the remaining dough to form a rope edge to
the crust. Line the crust with foil and weight with dried beans. Bake
about 10 minutes at 425 F., or until light golden. Remove beans and
foil. Cool crust on a rack. Reset oven to 350 F.

Combine sweet potatoes with the half-and-half, eggs, rum, sugars,
melted butter, nutmeg, and mace in a food processor. Process until
smooth. Pour into the cooled pie crust and bake for 35 minutes.

Combine the remaining 1/3 cup candy with the sliced almonds. At the
end of 35 minutes, sprinkle this mixture around the edge of the pie.
Continue baking pie 20 minutes more, or until a knife tests clean.

Cool pie, then refrigerate 2 hours or overnight.  Let set at room
temperature for 30 minutes before serving. Garnish with whipped cream
if desired.

Crustless Apple Pie

pies, pastries

5 cup apples, peeled, cored, cutup
1 cup sugar (or less)
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup biscuit mix *
2  eggs
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoon butter or margarine softened
1 teaspoon vanilla
1  topping
2/3 cup flour
1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon butter or margarine

* Use commercial biscuit mix, your own mix or mix together about 1/3 c + 1
tb flour, 3/8 ts baking powder, 1/8 ts salt, 4 tsp shortening.

Place apples in greased 10 inch pie plate.  Pour sugar over top. Sprinkle
with cinnamon.

Measure next five ingredients into blender and blend smooth, or measure
into a bowl and beat until smooth.  Pour over pie.

TOPPING:  Mix topping ingredients until crumbly.  Scatter over apples. Bake
at 350 F about 50 minutes until apples are cooked and topping is lightly
browned.

My note:  Why didn't I find a recipe like this *before* I learned to roll
piecrust?  Amount of sugar could be reduced if apples are sweet enough to
eat raw.  Daughter's comment, "why didn't you make desserts this good when
I lived at home?"

Danish Blue Cheese Pie

appetizers, fruits, pies, deserts, cheese

      ----CRUST----
11 oz pumpernickel bread; *
1/2 cup butter; no margarine
1/4 cup sugar; granulated
      ----CHEESE PIE----
2 each unflavored gelatin; envelopes
1/2 cup cold water
4 oz cream cheese
4 oz danish blue cheese
1 cup heavy cream
1 lb seedless green grapes

*    Use 1 loaf (11 oz) of thin sliced pumpernickel bread. NOTE:
Since this is a Cheese pie rather than a cake, you will need one
9-inch pie tin.

First prepare the crust.  Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F, then dry
the bread slices in the oven until they are hard enough to crumble
easily, (about 20 to 25 minutes). Meanwhile melt the butter. Crush
the bread, making about 1 1/2 cups of crumbs.  Add the butter and the
sugar and mix very well.  Press the crumbs into the pie tin. Raise
the oven temperature to 35o degrees F. and bake the crust fro 15
minutes. Allow to cool before filling.  Then prepare the filling. In
a medium-sized saucepan, combine the gelatin with the water and cook
over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is
clear (about 6 to 8 minutes). Cool. In a large mixing bowl, beat the
cream cheese until light and smooth. Mash the blue cheese well and
combine with the cream cheese. Pour the gelatin mixture into the bowl
with the cheese and mix well. Whip the cream until stiff and fold
into the cheese mixture.  Pour the filling gently into the prepared
crust. Press the grapes upright into the pie, leaving the tops
showing. Chill the pie for several hours or until set.

NOTE:

Since there is no sugar in this recipe, all the sweetness comes from
the grapes, it is not as sweet as a cheesecake. If it is too tart for
you, add just a little sugar, but it is well liked by most as an
appetizer without any sugar added.

Danish Pastry

pastries, deserts

4  to 6 cups flour
2 pkg dry yeast or 1 ounce fresh yeast
3 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3  whole eggs or 6 egg yolks
1 teaspoon grated orange rind
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom seeds (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/4 cup cold milk (approximately)
2 cup butter, firm, but not ice cold

When making Danish pastry it is important to keep the dough very
cold. In shaping small pastries, it is sometimes necessary to
re-chill partially shaped dough until it is firm enough for the job
to be completed. When you first make the pastry, be careful to follow
all the rules. Don't make it in the summertime unless your kitchen is
air conditioned. After you gain experience you may attempt short cuts
such as rolling out and folding the dough twice in succession without
re-chilling. Another way of shortening the process is by placing the
dough in the freezer between rollings. Usually 10 minutes in the
freezer is suffiecient. When you use this short cut, be careful not
to freeze the dough solid. The shaped pastries can also be chilled in
the freezer. They can even be baked frozen if extra baking time is
allowed. Any unbaked yeast pastries, however, should never be kept
frozen for more than a week or so; and it is preferable to bake anish
pastry within a day or two after it has been shaped.

Place 4 cups flour in large bowl.  Reserve remaining flour for
rolling. Make a well in center of bowl.

If dry yeast is used, see directions on package.  If fresh yeast is
used, cream it with sugar and salt to make a syrup. Add egg yolks or
whole eggs, grated orange rind, ground cardamom seeds, and vanilla.

Pour yeast mixture into well.  Add one cup milk and 1/4 cup butter
cut into pieces.  Mix with finger tips, adding more milk if necessary
to make a medium-soft dough. Knead dough in bowl for 5 minutes, or
until it is smooth but not elastic.  Flour it and let rest in
refrigerator for 30 minutes.

While dough is resting, form remaining butter into a flattened brick.
Using some of the reserved flour on wax paper or pastry cloth, roll
out butter into a square about 1/3 inch thick. Use plenty of flour
under and on top of butter to keep it from sticking. Loosen it
frequently as you rol. Cut the square in 2 pieces. Place in
refrigerator between sheets of wax paper.

Roll out dough on well-floured cloth to make a rectangle 3 times
longer than wide and about 1/3 inch thick. Brush excess flour from
dough. Place a piece of butter in center. Fold one end of dough over
butter. Place remaining butter on top.  Fold second end over the
butter. Press edges together.

Turn dough, changing its position so that the short ends are parallel
with the edge of table nearest you. Roll out on well-floured cloth,
using a firm, even motion to spread butter together with dough. Try
to work quickly, but check frequently underneat the dough to be sure
it isn't sticking.  Roll out a rectangele 3 times longer than wide,
about 1/3 inch thick.  rush excess flour from surface. Fold both ends
of dough to meet in center.  Press edges together, then fold in half
as if closing a book, which will make 4 layers of dough. Flour dough.
Place on a cooky sheet. Cover with aluminum foil. Refrigerate for 1/2
hour.

Repeat rolling and folding dough 3 more times, chilling it 20 minutes
between rollings.  Be sure to change position of dough each time so
that the short ends of dough are parallel with the edge of the table
nearest you when you start rolling.

After the final folding, chill dough at least 3 hours before shaping
and baking.

Danish Pastry - Dansk Wienerbrod

pastries, deserts, ethnic

4 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
2 1/4 oz yeast cakes
1 cup milk
1  egg
1 1/2 cup butter

Sift flour and mix with sugar and salt. Mix yeast with a little cold
milk. Add this, the rest of the milk and the beaten egg to flour and
sugar. Beat well until smooth with a wooden spoon.

Roll out the dough on baking board to 1 finger thickness. Spread small
pieces of butter on 2/3. of the dough. The butter must have same
consistency as the dough; if it is too soft it melts into the dough.
Fold together into three layers like folding a napkin, first the part
without butter. Roll out and fold again. Repeat three or four times.

Leave in cold place 1/2 hour. This is the dough with which many
different kinds of Danish pastry is made. When pastry is shaped,
place on baking sheet and leave in cold place to rise for 15-20 min.,
then brush with egg white and bake in a fast oven until golden brown.

Cocks' Combs (Hanekamme). Roll out dough to finger thickness and
spread with a paste made of equal parts of butter and sugar, then cut
into square pieces 4" x 4". Place filling across middle and fold
over. Press the edges firmly together and make 4-5 deep slashes in
this side. Let rise, brush with egg white and spread with chopped
almonds and sugar.

Spandauers. Roll our dough, spread with paste and cut as above. Place
filling in middle. Fold corners to the center and press down. After
baking drop 1 teaspoon of jelly in the center and spread with
frosting of confectioner's sugar and water.

Chocolate Buns (Cremeboller). Roll out dough, spread with paste and
cut as above. Place filling of vanilla creme in middle, fold corners
to center, forming dough as a ball and place upside down on baking
sheet. After baking spread with frosting of con- fectioner's sugar,
cocoa and water.

As filling may be used apple sauce, jelly, prunes, vanilla creme or
almond paste:

Vanilla Creme. Mix 1 egg yolk, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 table- spoon
flour and 3/4 cup milk and cook until thick. Take off, add 1/2
teaspoon vanilla extract and cool stirring occasionally.

Almond Paste. Cream 1/2 cup butter, add 1/4 lb. ground, blanched
almonds and 1/2 cup sugar and well until smooth. Another kind of
almond paste without butter is made of: 1/4 ]b. almonds, 1/2 cup
sugar and 3 egg whites. Work well together until smooth.

Dead Simple Lemon Pie

pies, deserts

1  beat together:

1 ea.12 oz. can of frozen lemonade, undiluted, 2 ea. 8 oz. cartons of
non-dairy frozen whipped toping and one can of sweetened condensed
milk, Borden is the cheapest in my area, and pour into a 9 oz.
KEEBLER graham cracker crust.

Chill in freezer for a couple of hours and then
Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thought you might like a recipe for a lemon pie.  It is dead simple
and rivals key lime pie for taste but has none of the egg yolks. Got
this out of my local Rural Electric monthly newletter.

If you chill this mix in a freezer it tastes an awful lot like ice
cream.

Deep-Dish Apple Pie With A Cheddar Crust - Hudson Valley

fruits, pies, pastries, deserts, holiday

      ----PIE SHELL----
3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 lb sharp cheddar cheese; grated
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 lb (2 sticks) unsalted butter; cut into tablespoons
2 each eggs; lightly beaten
      ----FILLING----
5 lb golden delicious apples (about 12); peeled, cored, and sliced
1 each juice of 1 lemon
1 1/2 cup light browwn sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt

Make the pie shell: In a food processor  pulse the flour, cheese and
salt to mix. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles course
meal. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and make a well in the center.
Stir in the eggs and work the dough into a ball.

Divide the dough into quarters and flatten into disks.  Roll out each
disk to an 11-inch round between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Remove the wax
paper and line two 9-inch pie pans with a dough round. Refrigerate the
lined pans and the 2 dough rounds, covered, until thoroughly chilled.

Make the filling: preheat the oven to 375 F degrees. In a large bowl, toss
the apples with the lemon juice. Sprinkle on the brown sugar, flour and
salt and toss well. Divide the apples between the lined pie pans. Moisten
the pie-shell rims and cover with the dough rounds. Trim any overhang and
crimp the edges to seal. Cut 4 steam vents in each pie. (Make Ahead: the
pies can be chilled until firm, then wrapped and frozen for up to two
weeks. All before baking.)

Bake the pies on the bottom shelf of the oven for about one hour, or
until golden and bubbly and the apples are tender when pierced ; cover the
pies with foil halfway through if necessary. Let cool for about one hour
before serving.

Dick Miale Pizza

pasta, pies, pastries, cheese, diabetic

3 cup unbleached white flour
2 cup cracked wheat flour
2 pkg yeast
2 cup water
1 teaspoon salt

Most rustic types of bread consist of just flour, yeast, water and
salt. I usually vary mine using a cracked wheat and also semolina
flour. It seems to give the bread character. When I was under a
Neurosurgeon, we were talking about sugars in the American diet and
he said in Iran, the bread was made with out any sugars. I don't use
a bread machine either. I bake mine on unglazeed quarry tiles and
throw ice cubes in the bottom when I put the bread in. Gives it a
nice rustic flavor and appearance. Sunday I made Pizza using 3 cups
unbleached white flour and 2 cups cracked wheat flour along with 2
pks yeast, 2 cup water and 1 tsp salt. (no fats-no sugar) Put veggies
on the top, using fresh tomatoes. It made to large rounds. Again the
only fat was the pam on the bottom and Pam on the top plus 1 Tbs.
grating cheese for both pizzas. Worked out to be about 1/2 veggie and
2 bread for 2 slices. Tasted a heck of a lot better than some of the
commercial pizzas.

Dixie Pecan Pie

pies, pastries

1  pastry for a 9 pie
3  large eggs
2 tablespoon flour
2 tablespoon sugar
2 cup dark corn syrup
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt, if desired
1 cup pecan halves

1.  Preheat the oven to 425 F. 2. Line a pie plate with pastry.
Refrigerate. 3. Beat the eggs until light. Blend the flour and sugar
and add
this to the eggs.  Beat well.  Add the remaining ingredients,
blending well. 4. Pour the mixture into the pie shell and bake 10
minutes.  Reduce
the oven heat to 325 F and continue baking about 45 minutes. A
little pecan lore from Craig Claiborne:

"Pecans are, to my mind, the most Southern of nuts. One authority I
know states that they were grown in Virginia long before George
Washington was born and that the name derives from the American
Indian word 'pakan'. The earliest colonists in Virginia and North
Carolina transliterated the word as 'pagan' and as a result, the
Pagan River, which flows through Smithfield, Virginia, was named for
the abundance of pecan trees that grew along its shores and not for
any pagans who lived nearby."

Easter Pie

pies, pastries, deserts

      ----PHILLY.INQUIRER----
      ----FOR THE CRUST----
3/4 lb crisco
2 1/2 cup flour
5  egg yolks
2 tablespoon or 3 of sugar
      ----FOR THE FILLING----
3 lb ricotta
7  whole eggs
5  extra whites
1/2 cup sugar or more
1  grated rind of 1 or more
1  lemons
1 tablespoon vanilla
2 tablespoon liqueur

Crust:  Mix Crisco shortening with flour, cutting it in with pastry
blender or two knives until you get beads like small peass. Mix in
the egg yolks and sugar. Knead a little bit to get it to hang
together. Add more flour if you have to. Don't play with it! Put in
the refrigerator while you do the rest. FILLING: A lot depends on the
ricotta here. Supermarket ricotta must be drained of whey. Italian
cheese stores and delis throughout the city (Philly) especially at
this season, sell handmade ricotta, which makes a denser and creamier
cake. It coasts about $2.00 more for 3 lbs. "I use Tia Maria, Grand
Marnier, Amaretto, whatever liqueur I feel like depending on my many
moods", says Nanny Giordano. Beat up the eggs good with sugar,mix in
lemon, vanilla and liqueur, then mix with cheese." Beat it up nice,
don't go" Johanna flings her hands around aimlessly." GET IT Smooth".
Use a deep ovenproof glass.I used a 2" deep,13" oval dish from
France,Arcuisine d'Arcopal. Nanny doesn't bother, but I rubbed the
surface with a little shortening to prevent sticking. Take dough from
refrigerator. "Can you roll it out? Yes but don't bother "Take pieces
in your hands and plaster the inside of the dish, more or less
lumpily smooth. Pour in filling. Bake in a slow oven, at 325 deg.
"until it's done. About 1 hour. It'll set and puff. You'll see. "I
made this recipe. I saw. It works.You may have more or less chese
left over,depending on your baking dish and your ricotta.But it will
work... This is the recipe of Johanna Guarracino as told to Jim Quinn
of the Inqir.

Easy Cream Cheese Pastry

pies, pastries, baking

1 cup unsalted butter; room temp
8 oz cream cheese; room temp
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cup to 2-1/3 cups flour
1/4 cup to 2/3 cup powdered sugar
1  optional

The dough for this melt-in-your-mouth pastry is very easy to handle
as long as it is first thoroughly chilled. The pastry is perfect for
any fruit pie or fruit/jam filled turnover.

DIRECTIONS: Cream the butter, cream cheese and vanilla in a mixing
bowl. Gradually sift 2 cups of the flour into the bowl, mixing with a
fork until the dough forms a ball. Add a little more flour if the
dough is too sticky. Divide the dough in half. Wrap in plastic wrap
and refrigerate 45 minutes or overnight.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Lightly sprinkle a work surface with some of the remaining flour or
powdered sugar. Flatten one dough ball into a thick disk. Lightly
dust the dough and a rolling pin with a little flour or powdered
sugar. Using short even strokes, roll the dough from the center into
a circle 2 inches larger than the pie pan you plan to use, turning
the dough every few strokes and dusting it with flour or powdered
sugar as needed. roll to about 1/8 inch thickness.

Lift the dough off the working surface with a pastry scraper and fold
it in half and then into quarters to form a triangle. Place the
pointed end of the triangle into the center of the pie pan and unfold
so the dough drapes about 1/2 inch beyond the rim of the pan. (Or
carefully roll the dough onto the rolling pin and transfer to the pie
pan.) With your fingertips, firmly press the dough into the pan.
Prick the bottom all over with a fork. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes,
just until pale golden.

Freeze the remaining dough for another use. To make a double crusted
pie, fill the shell. Roll the remaining dough to fit the top of the
pie pan. Brush the rim of the shell with water and place the dough
over the filling. Crimp with your finger or press the tines of a fork
dipped in flour into the dough around the rim to seal.

Makes one 8 or 9 inch double pie crust, OR
... one 10 inch single pie crust, OR
... six 8 inch triangular turnovers, OR
... 12 to 15 small tarts.

Edinburgh Tart Or Queen Mary's Tart

pies, pastries, uk

1  **  british measurements  **
1  ingredients listed in recipe

The following recipe was introduced to me by the latter name with the story
that it had been devised as a treat when Mary Queen of Scots first came to
Edinburgh. It was certainly a tea time treat and because it is so easy to
make, well worth a try.

Directions:

Line a greased 8 or 9 inch shallow dish, plate or flan ring with puff
pastry and into the centre pour the following mixture:

2 ounces of sugar dissolved in 2 ounces of melted butter to which is added
2 ounces of chopped candied peel, 1 ounce of sultanas and 2 beaten eggs.

Bake in a hot oven, 450øF / 230øC / gas mark 8 for about 15 to 20 minutes.
Use a lower shelf. Or reduce the temperature slightly and bake for 20 to 30
minutes.

It looks extraordinary but is delicious served either hot or cold with
cream. ** Scottish Home Baking **

Ernest Hemingway Key Lime Pie

pies, pastries, deserts

1 x no ingredients

Some might wonder the connection between Key Lime Pie and Ernest Hemingway,
but he hung out a lot, a regular squatter of sorts, at Papa John's Bar, Key
West Florida.  There are not too many recipes attributed to him, and then I
recently ran across this one for Key Lime Pie. The intro to the recipe
attributes that Hemingway used to live at 1599 Bathurst Street in Toronto,
Canada. He was working as a young journalist then for the Toronto Star. He
eventually moved to Florida, then Cuba, and developed a fond appetite for
white rum, seafood and Key West Lime Pie. He hung out quite a bit with such
randy's as Steven Boyd.  Papa John's is quite a museum in itself and sports
newspaper articles and pictures of Papa and his cronies (including Boyd).
So here is Papa's Key Lime Pie.  I do believe this recipe was printed at
one time in the Toronto Star. 1 cup sugar 250 mL 1/4 cup white flour 50 mL
3 TBS cornstarch 40 mL 2 cups spring water 500 mL 3 egg yolks 3 1 TBS
margarine                    15 mL 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 50 mL grated
rind of 1 lime one baked pie shell meringue pie topping

Combine sugar, flour, cornstarch in top of double boiler and gradually stir
in water.  Cook over medium heat, whisking until thickened.

Beat egg yolks and gradually stir some of cooked mixture into beaten egg
yolks.  Return this mixture to double boiler and cook and whisk another 3
minutes.

Stir in margarine, lime juice and rind.  Cook to lukewarm.  Pour into your
favorite baked shell and cool thoroughly.  Top with meringue and brown
under broiler, or your favorite whipped cream topping.

For you pie shell, why not add a small amount of sugar and some finely
crushed macadamia nuts?  Takes it a cut above.

(And I always use more lime juice--its a matter of taste.  I like it tart
and cut back on the sugar.)

Frango Mint Pie

pies

1 cup butter
2 cup sugar, confectioner's (sifted)
4 oz chocolate, unsweetened
4  eggs
3/4 teaspoon peppermint extract
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
10  vanilla wafers, crushed

Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy.

In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate. Add to the
butter-sugar mixture and beat thoroughly. Add the eggs one at a time,
beating well after each egg, until well blended. Fold in the
peppermint and vanilla.

Line the pie tin with the vanilla wafer crumbs (buttering the pie tin
makes them stick to the side a little better). Pour in the filling.
Refrigerate for two hours.

NOTES:

*  Decadent chocolate mint pie -- One of the things that is memorable
about Marshall Field's department store in Chicago is their "Frango
chocolate mints." This pie captures the flavor perfectly. I got the
recipe from Malcolm Slaney, who "found it in a cookbook when [he was]
attending Kayak School in Oregon."

*  This recipe fills a shallow 8 inch pie tin; add 50 percent to
everything to fill a 9-inch pie tin.

*  If you're not very good at pie crusts (I'm not), feel free to use a
pre-formed graham cracker crust. The chocolate and mint flavors
predominate, no matter what crust you use.

*  This is serious decadence! The first time I made this, I stopped
several times in disbelief of just what I was doing. Enjoy!

: Difficulty:  moderate (melting chocolate is tricky).
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

pastry. Make filling: In small saucepan combine 1/3 cup sugar and the
flour; mix well. Stir in milk.  Bring to boiling, stirring; reduce
heat; simmer, stirring until slightly thickened ~ 1 minute. In a
small bowl, beat 3 egg yolks slightly.  Beat in a little of hot
mixture; pour back into saucepan, beating to mix well.  Stir in 1
tablespoon butter and the vanilla. Turn into bowl to cool. Core,
pare, and slice apples; sprinkle with lemon juice. In medium skillet,
heat butter with sugar and nutmeg. Add apple slices; saute, stirring
occasionally, until partially cooked - about 5 minutes. Remove from
heat.  Heat apricot preserves just until melted. Preheat oven to
425F. Turn filling into pie shell, spreading evenly. Arrange apple
slices on top, mounding slightly in center. Spread with apricot
preserves. Roll out rest of pastry to form a 10-inch circle. With
knife or pastry wheel, cut into 12 strips 1/2" wide. Slightly moisten
rim of pie shell with cold water.  Arrange 6 stips across filling;
press ends to rim of pie shell, trimming off ends if necessary.
Arrange rest of strips at right angle to first strips, to form a
lattice. Bring overhang of pastry up over ends of strips; crimp edge.
Mix yolk with a tablespoon of water; use to brush lattice strips, not
edge. On lowest shelf of oven, bake 35-40 minutes, or until pastry is
golden. Cool. Serve slightly warm.

Fruit Tart

fruits, pies, pastries

1  pie shell (make your own, or buy th; e frozen, uncooked kind)
1/2 cup water
1 cup sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
10 cup fruit, sliced
1  cinnamon or nutmeg, ground (to tast; e)

Mash about 2 C of the fruit in a saucepan with the water, sugar, and
cornstarch.  Add another sprinkle of nutmeg or cinnamon.  Boil until the
liquid becomes clear (about two minutes).

Place the remaining fruit in the pie shell, and a sprinkle of the nutmeg or
cinnamon.  Pour the hot mixture over the fruit, and let cool for at least
two hours.

Serve with whipped cream or ice cream as desired.

NOTES:

*  A quick fruit tart pie -- This is just about the ideal way to use up any
fresh fruit you have lying around.  I got the recipe from my mom.

*  Any fresh fruit in season will do; I've made peach, nectarine and
strawberry/banana, all to good effect.

*  Scheduling usually works out well if you make this shortly before
serving the meal, and let it cool while you eat.

: Difficulty:  easy.

Gene Blystone's Venison Mincemeat

pies, pastries, deserts, game

4 lb venison
2 lb beef suet tart apples
3 lb brown sugar
2 cup maple syrup or
2 cup dark molasses
2 quart cider
3 lb currants
4 lb seeded raisins
1/2 lb citron, cut fine
1  ot
1 quart brandy or
1 quart wine
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon ground clove
1 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon mace
1 teaspoon nutmeg salt to taste apple jack or

Cover and cook the venison and suet with boiling water until tender; let it
cool in the liquid. When it is cold and the fat has solidified, remove meat
and chop the cake fat (suet). Reboil the liquid until it has been reduced
to 1 1/2 cups. Chop the venison and add it to twice as much peeled, cored
and finely chopped apple. Add the sugar and maple syrup or molasses. Add
the dried fruit, suet, cider and the reduced boiling liquid. Boil slowly
for 2 hours, stirring to prevent burning. Add the apple jack or brandy or
wine and the spices. Mix thoroughly and store in crocks or jars. May also
be frozen, but does't freeze hard. Yield: 15 pies, recipe can be cut in
half.

Note: It is by no means necessary to use exactly the ingredients given. You
may want to add orange or lemon peel, chopped figs or may prefer a
different proportion of spices. You may also use wine or sherry in place of
the cider.

Girl Scout Cookie Do-Si-Do Temptation

pies, bananas

1/2 cup banana liqueur
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
2 3/4 cup heavy cream
1/2  vanilla bean
1  4 egg yolks
1 1/2 cup sugar
3 tablespoon cornstarch
1  3 ripe bananas
1  juice of 1 lemon
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips
1  baked pie crust
1 1/2 cup bourbon chocolate mousse
1 pkg do-si-dos cookies, crushed
1  whipped cream for garnish

Place the banana liqueur in a small mixing bowl. Sprinkle the gelatin
on top and allow to soften for 5 minutes. Place the bowl over
simmering water until the gelatin is completely clear. Set aside.

In a saucepan, combine the heavy cream and vanilla bean. Bring to a
boil, remove from heat, cover and allow to steep while preparing the
yolk mixture.

In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks while gradually adding sugar.
When the yolks have lightened, whisk in cornstarch. Strain the cream
and allow it  to cool slightly. Gradually pour it into the yolk
mixture while stirring.  Return to a clean saucepan over medium heat
and stir constantly until the  mixture begins to boil. Reduce the
heat and continue to stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, whisk
in the gelatin mixture and incorporate thoroughly. Allow the pastry
cream to cool completely.

Slice two of the bananas on the bias and brush with lemon juice.
Spread peanut butter on bottom of Baked Pie Crust, then spread
Chocolate Mousse on top of peanut butter, then top with a layer of
bananas and about 1/3 cup cookie crumbles. Top with banana custard.
Just before serving, top with 1/3 cup of cookie crumbles and
chocolate chips. With pastry bag, pipe whipped cream on pie. Slice
the third banana (you may not need all of it) and arrange slices on
top in a circle, then sprinkle with chocolate chips and additional
cookie crumbles.

This makes a very rich pie; thin slices are called for.

You will have leftover banana-flavored pastry cream, which you could
pour into tart shells or layer with the leftover crumbles in tall
parfait glasses,  topped with additional chocolate chips, cookie
crumbles and whipped cream.

Gluten-Free Pastry

pies, pastries, diabetic

1 1/2 cup whole bean flour (try puree)
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 tablespoon cornmeal
1 teaspoon gf baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoon vegetable shortening
1  egg white
3/4 cup cold water

Bean flour is a new product being promoted by the Ontario Coloured Bean
Growers of Ontario.  If not available to you, try white bean puree. Less
fat is required with bean flour than whole wheat flour for pastry.

Stir together dry ingredients, then cut in shortening until mixture is
crumbly using pastry blender or 2 knives. Try adding puree alternately with
shortening.

Whisk together egg white and a little less water if using bean puree. Stir
into dry ingredients to make a soft dough. Divide dough in half. Roll dough
out to 1/8" thickness on a cornstarch dusted surface, between layers of
waxed paper or layers of plastic wrap. Press into pan, patching if
necessary.

For pie shell or single crust: Trim edge leaving half-inch overhang to tuck
under and flute edge. Line inside of pastry shell with piece of foil. Bake
at 400 F for 15 minutes or until edges are golden brown, remove foil.

For double-crust pie: Trim edge, fill, roll top pastry. Tuck 1/2 inch
overhang under edge of bottom crust, press firmly together. Flue edges. Cut
steam vents. Bake as recipe directs for filling.

Makes 1 double-crust, 2 single pie shells or 24 medium tart shells.

Glynne's Lemon Meringue Pie

pies, pastries

8 oz self raising flour
4 oz margarine
1  grated rind of 1 orange
1  egg; beaten
2 oz caster sugar
  Enough water to form a ball of doug
1  juice and grated rind of two lemons
4 tablespoon cornflour; (approximately)
2  eggs
2 oz caster sugar
1  water

* This is enough for two bases I normally make a pear custard tart
with the second base)

Rub the margarine into the flour until it's like bread crumbs add the
orange rind caster sugar and mix well.Add the beaten egg and mix well . Add
enough water ( give it a chance to soak in ) a tablespoon at a time to make
a ball.Cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour.

Put the juice and rind of the lemons into a measuring jug and make up
to just less than half a pint with some water. Put the cornflour into a cup
and mix with a couple of tablespoons of the lemon mixture until it is smoot
. Pour the cornflour mixture and the rest of the lemon and water into a
saucepan. Heat over a medium heat stirring continuously until the mixture i
thick ( it does turn out very thick but don't worry ) and the cornflour is
cooked out. Allow to cool stirring occasionally .

Get the pastry from the fridge and roll out and line an 8 in flan case
pie dish , I'm not sure what you call it , and prick the base with a fork.
Bake the pastry blind , lined with foil & baking beans, for 15 mins in a
hot oven ( 180-200 C) so that it doesn't rise too much but is golden.

Remove the base from the oven.

Separate the two eggs , retain the whites , and beat the yolks into th
lemon mixture until smooth . Beat the sugar into the lemon mixture until
smooth . Fill the pastry case with the lemon mixture . Add a tablespoon of
sugar to the egg whites and whisk until it forms peaks fold in the rest of
the caster sugar and pile on top of the pie. Bake in the oven until the
meringue is nicely brown . Serve hot or cold.

I have also tried this with oranges ( made up to 1/2 pint with orange
juice rather than water) and lemon zest in the pastry.

Great Meringue

pies, pastries

      ----FROM ELAINE PONCELET----
      ----VISION DIMENSION BBS----
12 medium egg whites
1/4 teaspoon heaping of cream of tartar
2 cup powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 400F. Separate yolks from whites, being careful not to drip
any yellow in the whites or they won't beat up. Put into a bowl, add the
cream of tartar, and beat until stiff.

Add the powdered sugar and beat until it forms soft peaks.

Spread a layer of meringue on the pie. Make a good seal over the filling.
Spread until it meets the edge of the crust to keep the meringue from
shrinking as it stands or bakes. Repeat until the meringue is used up, then
gently swirl the top to make it pretty.

Bake about 15 minutes or until golden brown.

Ground Cherry Pie

fruits, pies

1  pie crust (9 2-crust)
3 tablespoon quick-cooking tapioca
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg; grated
1  dash of salt
2 1/2 cup ground cherries; husked
2 tablespoon butter

"Ground cherries grow wild on low bushy plants along uncut country
roadsides and in uncultivated fields. They are especially prolific in
the Mississippi Valley. The fruit goes by several regional names: husk
tomatoes, chew cherries, strawberry tomatoes, or winter cherries. The
ground cherry plant is the first cousin to the ornamental Japanese
lantern, which it resembles. The firm fruit, which is nestled in a
husk, is about the size of a cherry and looks like a green tomato,
though the color varies from green to yellow to red. To me, it also
resembles a tiny Mexican tomatilla. Its flavor has been likened to
tomatoes and strawberries, and the fruit is most commonly used in
pie, though I have also eaten it in chili sauce and jam. I see ground
cherries occasionally at farmer's markets around the country."

Line a 9-inch pie pan with pastry and set aside. Preheat the oven to
400    degrees F.

In a medium bowl, combine the tapioca, sugars, almond extract,
nutmeg, and salt. Sprinkle half the mixture in the bottom of the
pastry shell and top with the cherries. Sprinkle the remainder of the
sugar mixture over the cherries and dot with the butter. Top with a
lattice design or other decorative top crust.

Bake for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 350 degrees F and bake
about 45 to 50 minutes longer, or until the crust is deep golden and
the juices in the pie are bubbling up in the center. Cool before
cutting.

Half-And Half Pastry

pies, pastries, deserts

1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/4 cup shortening
1 pinch pinch of salt
1/4 cup cold butter
3 tablespoon to 5 tbsp cold water

1.  Blend flour, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl. Cut butter
and
shortening into 1/2-inch cubes and add to flour mixture. Using a
pastry blender or 2 knives, cut into dry mixture until it is the
con-
sistency of coarse meal.

2.  Then gradually sprinkle 3 tablespoons cold water over flour
mixture,
using a fork to work liquid into dry ingredients. Then work in
just
enough remaining cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, so dough can
be
gathered into a firm ball.

3.  Flatten ball slightly with the palm of your hand. Wrap pastry and
refrigerate at least until chilled, about 30 minutes. Pastry will
keep
well for several days.  It also freezes well.

Harvest Pie (Tdn)

fruits, pies, deserts

6 medium tart, firm apples (such as
1  granny smith), peeled, cored
1  and cut into 1/2 chunks
4 medium green tomatoes, unpeeled,
1  cored, & cut into 1/2
1  chunks
3 tablespoon dried currants
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon cloves
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  crust for double 10 pie
2 tablespoon rum or brandy (optional)
3 tablespoon butter, cut into small
1  chunks

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Cut up enough apples and tomatoes to make 3 quarts of chunks. Add
currants. Combine brown sugar, flour, spices and salt in a bowl and
rub together with your hands to blend evenly. Toss with fruit.

Divide pie dough in unequal halves. Roll the bigger half to be 1/8
inch thick.  Fit it into the bottom of a 10 inch deep-dish pie plate.
Trim edges.  Roll excess dough with remaining dough into a rough
rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. Cut in strips as wide as you prefer.

Fill the bottom crust with apple mixture.  Sprinkle rum or brandy, if
desired, over the top, then dot with butter. Cover crust with pastry
strips in a windowpane pattern. Sprinkle with a little sugar, if
desired. (The pie also can be covered with cut-out pastry, with a
full pastry crust or a crust of some other design.)

Bake for 10 minutes.  Lower heat to 350 degrees and cook 40 minutes
or so, until the topis light brown and the filling is bubbly. Letting
it cool an hour or so will make it easier to slice.

Helen's Pumpkin Pudding

pies, pastries

1 1/2 cup browned, strained pumpkin
2 tablespoon all purpose flour
1 cup brown sugar
2 cup milk
1 cup carnation 2% canned milk
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
2  eggs, beaten

This recipe calls for browned pumpkin which is accomplished by buttering a
heavy cast iron frying pan and cooking the 2 cups pumpkin over medium heat,
stirring and turning so all parts dry properly. Keep this up til it is
reduced to 1 1/2 cups.  It will be slightly browned.

Place the browned pumpkin in a bowl, sprinkle with flour and brown sugar
and stir til thoroughly mixed.  Add spices and eggs and beat well. Scald
milk.  Add the canned milk to scalded milk.  Add milks to pumpkin mixture
Beat together til well mixed.

Place mixture in a greased casserole and place it in a larger casserole
with hot water that comes half way up the outside of inner casserole. Place
in a 325 F oven and oven poach til a knife comes out clean when tested.
Serve hot or cold.

This is actually my pumpkin pie filling, but I prefer it without the pastry
and it is better for me.  No great amount of fat in this one.

Individual Pecan Pies

cakes, pies, deserts

6 oz plain flour
5 oz melted butter
1 tablespoon icing (confectioners) sugar
1 tablespoon water
3 1/2 oz pecan nuts (broken large)
2  eggs (size 3/medium)
2 oz dark brown soft sugar
5 oz golden syrup (corn syrup)

Mix together the flour, icing sugar, water and 4 oz of the melted
butter. (You should kneed together for a good mix).

Divide between 6 x 4 inch flan tins or small bun tins and press up the
edges (prick lightly with a fork to reduce the amount the centre
rises)

Place on a baking tray and blind bake in a preheated oven at
190C/375F/gas mark 5 for 10 to 15 mins (until golden brown)

Remove and divide the chopped pecans between the pastry cases.

Whisk the eggs, then stir in the sugar, syrup and remaining 1 oz
melted butter. Beat well and spoon into the pastry cases, filling
almost to the top. (this makes probably 50% TOO much mixture for me)

Return to the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until set and golden.

Serve hot or cold with cream, creme fraishe or ice cream.

James Beard's Mincemeat

pies, holiday, preserves

4 lb beef rump or brisket
4 lb beef tongue
1 lb beef suet
2 lb seedless raisins
2 lb sultana raisins
2 lb currants
3/4 lb citron peel, diced and
1/2 lb orange peel, finely chopped
1/2 lb lemon peel, finely chopped
1 lb sugar
1 pint strawberry preserves
1 pint raspberry preserves
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon cinnamon
2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 1/2 teaspoon mace
1 teaspoon allpice
3/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1  sherry or cognac

"Begin by assembling a goodly supply of Cognac, apple brandy, sherry,
and if you can find it, boiled cider. If not, settle for more apple
brandy or applejack and more Cognac. You can also use up any odd
liquers or that bottle you were given last Crhistams and have kept
hidden on a shelf. All these things will help to make your mincemeat
better."

Boil the rump and tongue seperately in salted water until tender. Let
the rump cool until it can be handled, remove the excess fat, and
chop coarsely or put through the coarse blad of a meat grinder. Let
the tongue cool, remove the skin, and chop or grind coarsely. Chop
the beef suet very finely and combine it in a crock with the meats.
Add raisins, sultanas, currants, citron, peels and mix well.  Add
sugar and jams and salt. Mix spices together and mix into the mixture
in the crock. Mix ingredients well with the hands and then cover the
mixture with Sherry, Cognac, etc. -- enough to a make a rather loose
mixture. Cover tightly and let rest for 2 weeks. Uncover and taste,
and add more spirits if necessary. Let rest for another 2 weeks
before using.

At this point, if you wish to store the mincemeat in smaller
containers, transfer it to sterilized jars or crocks, add more
liquor, and seal or cover them tightly. The mincemeat will keep more

Jelly-Filled Pears In Puff Pastry With Carame

fruits, pastries, deserts

      ----SAUCE----
1 1/3 cup sugar
7 tablespoon water
1 cup whipping cream
1 tablespoon calvados or other apple brandy
      ----PEARS----
4  small bartlett pears (about 5 oz ea; ), peeled
4 teaspoon red currant jelly
1 pkg (17 1/4 oz) frozen puff pastry (2 s; heets), thawed
1  egg yolk, beaten to blend (glaze)
1  vanilla ice cream (opt)

FOR SAUCE: Stir sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over medium
heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring
until syrup turns deep-amber color, occasionally swirling pan and
brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush to dissolve any
sugar crystals. Remove from heat. Carefully stir in cream (mixture
will bubble vigorously). Cool. Stir in Calvados.  (Can be made 1 day
ahead. Cover and chill).

FOR PEARS:  Cut off top 1 1/2 inches from stem end of pears and
reserve. Core each pear through the top, leaving bottom intact. Spoon
1 teaspoon jelly into hole in each pear. Replace stem end.

On work surface, roll out each pastry sheet to  18x15 inch rectangle.
Cut out four 8 inch rounds and four 2 inch rounds. Reserve scraps.
Place pear in center of each 8 inch pastry round. Gather pastry
around each pear and pinch pastry to hold in place (stem end will be
exposed). Brush pastry with egg glaze.  Make hole in center of each
two inch pastry round. Fit 1 round over stem of each pear to form
top. Press firmly against pastry bottom to seal. Brush pastry top
with egg glaze. Cut out 4 small leaves from pastry scraps. Brush with
egg glaze and place 1 leaf just below stem of each pear. Refrigerate
at least one hour and up to
2    hours.

Preheat oven to 400F.  Butter baking sheet.  Place pears on prepared
sheet and bake until pastry is golden brown, about 25 minutes.

Rewarm caramel sauce over medium heat, stirring frequently. Spoon
sauce onto 4 plates.  Place hot pear in center of each plate. Serve
with scoops of vanilla ice cream, if desired.

Kalitsounia Me Kanella (Cretan Cheese-Cinnamon Pastries)

pastries, deserts, greek, biscuits

1  karen mintzias
1 1/2 cup fresh mizithra or ricotta
2 tablespoon grated hard ricotta
2  eggs; separated
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoon butter; melted
4 tablespoon milk (or more)
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  confectioners' sugar

For the filling, combine the cheeses, lightly beaten egg yolks,
sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and melted butter in a bowl. The
mixture should be thick enough to mound, but not stiff; add 1
tablespoon milk, if necessary. Set aside while you make the dough.

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, then cut in the butter and mix by
rubbing between your fingers.  Mix in the vanilla, egg whites, and
enough milk to make a soft dough.  Knead until smooth and elastic,
then break off small pieces and roll as thin of a dime.  (The dough
will be elastic and can be rolled easily.)  Cut into circles 4-inches
in diameter (teacup size), then on each circle place a teaspoon of
the cheese filling. Wet the circle edge with water or milk and fold
over to form a half-moon, then seal with the tines of a fork or
pastry wheel. Arrange the Kaltisounia on buttered cookie sheets and
bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes, or until the pastry
puffs up and turns a light chestnut color. Remove from the oven, and
place on racks, and dust with confectioners' sugar and cinnamon.
Serve hot or cold.

Kataifi (Shredded Nut Pastries)

pastries, deserts, greek

1  karen mintzias
500 gm kataifi pastry
1 cup butter; melted
      ----NUT FILLING----
1 cup coarsely ground walnuts
1 cup coarsely ground almonds
1/2 cup caster sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1  egg white; lightly beaten
1 tablespoon brandy
      ----SYRUP----
2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1  thin strip of lemon rind
4  cloves
1  piece cinnamon bark
1 tablespoon honey

Makes: 40 pieces Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F)
Cooking time: 50-55 minutes

Take an eighth of the pastry strands and spread out on
a board to a 18 x 25 cm (7 x 10 inch) rectangle with
strands running roughly lengthwise. Using a pastry
brush, dab some butter over strands.  Combine nut
filling ingredients and spread about 2 tablespoons of
filling along one narrow edge.  Roll up firmly into a
neat roll.  Repeat with remaining ingredients. Place
rolls close together in a 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 inch)
slab cake pan or baking dish.  Brush top with
remaining butter.  Bake in a moderate oven, one shelf
above centre, for 50-55 minutes until golden brown.

Meanwhile, dissolve sugar in water over heat, add
lemon juice and rind, cloves and cinnamon.  Bring to
the boil and boil over medium heat for 10 minutes.
Stir in honey, strain and cool.  Pour cooled syrup
over hot pastries and place a folded cloth on top.
Leave until cool.  Cut each roll into 5 pieces
diagonally if preferred.

ALTERNATIVE SHAPING:  Take a small handful of pastry
strands and spread out fairly compactly on board.
Have strands running towards you as much as possible
and dab with butter.  Mould a tablespoon of nut
filling into a short sausage shape and place on one
end.  Roll up firmly into a neat roll and place in
baking dish.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Makes about 30 rolls each about 5 cm (2 inches) long.
Bake as directed above, prepare syrup and finish as in
previous recipe.

Kataifi Me Krema (Shredded Pastry With Custar

pastries, deserts, greek

1  karen mintzias
      ----CUSTARD FILLING----
4 cup milk
3/4 cup cornflour
4  eggs; beaten
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla essence
      ----KATAIFI CRUST----
500 gm kataifi (shredded pastry)
3/4 cup unsalted butter; melted
      ----SYRUP----
2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup water
1  thin strip lemon rind
1  piece of cinnamon bark
3 teaspoon lemon juice

Oven temperature: 190 C (375 F) Cooking time: 1 hour

Combine milk and cornflour in a heavy pan.  Blend in
beaten eggs and add salt and sugar.  Place over medium
heat and stir constantly until thickened and bubbling.
Remove from heat, stir in vanilla essence and cover
top of custard with buttered paper to prevent a skin
forming.

Place kataifi in a large bowl and gently separate
strands with fingers. Grease a 20 x 28 cm (8 x 11
inch) oven dish with some of the butter.  Put half the
kataifi in the base, pressing it down to make it
compact. Drizzle 1/4 cup butterr evenly over it.  Pour
custard filling over kataifi, spreading it evenly.
Top with remaining kataifi.  Spread evenly and pat
down gently.  Pour remaining melted butter evenly over
top.  Bake in a moderately hot oven for 45 minutes
until golden brown.  Remove from oven and leave until
cool.

Dissolve sugar in water over medium heat, add lemon
rind and cinnamon bark and bring to the boil.  Add
lemon juice and boil over medium heat for 15 minutes,
skimming when necessary.  Do not stir once syrup is
boiling. Strain hot syrup over cooled pastry.  Leave
until cold and cut into diamond shapes to serve.

Note: The previous recipe is the traditional way in
which this dessert is made.  As the custard and syrup
soften the kataifi, many good cooks use the following
method for a crisp finish:

Prepare the syrup as directed above and leave until
cool.  Place the kataifi in a bowl and loosen stands.
Pour on 1/2 cup melted, unsalted butter and mix with
fingers to coat strands.  Spread kataifi in two
buttered 20 x 28 cm (8 x 11 inch) straight-sided oven
dishes and press down to make it compact.  Bake in a
moderately hot oven for 20-25 minutes until golden -
take care that it does not become too brown.  Remove
from the oven and pour cooled syrup evenly over hot
kataifi in each dish. Cover each dish with a tea towel
so that kataifi softens slightly, otherwise it will be
difficult to cut.  Make custard as directed in
previous recipe and pour while hot onto kataifi in one
dish.  Invert other dish of kataifi on top of the
custard.  Leave uncovered until cool, then cut into
diamond shapes to serve.

Key Lime Pie

pies, pastries, southern

3  eggs
14 oz condensed milk (one standard can)
4 oz key lime juice
1  sugar
1  graham cracker pie crust

Separate the eggs.  You'll be whipping the whites, so put them in a large
enough bowl.  Combine the egg yolks, the condensed milk and the juice, and
stir until thoroughly combined.  The acidity of the juice thickens the milk
and eggs into a custard.

Add a pinch of sugar to the egg whites, and beat them until stiff but not
dry.

Spoon the custard into the pie crust and even it out.  Spoon the beaten egg
whites on top of the custard and even it out so it looks pretty.

Chill before serving.  If you like, run the pie under a hot broiler for a
minute until the egg whites are slightly browned.  (This is primarily for
appearance, it doesn't affect the flavor much.)

NOTES:

*  Traditional lime pie dessert from the Florida Keys -- This very easy
custard pie originated in the Florida Keys in the 1800's when fresh
ingredients other than the local limes were hard to come by. See the notes
for information on some of the ingredients.  Yield: One 8-inch pie.

*  Everybody in the Florida Keys seems to have a variant of this recipe. It
shows up on postcards, place mats, lime juice bottles and guide books. Some
people fold a little of the beaten egg white into the custard to make it
lighter.  Some put sweetened whipped cream on top rather than egg white.
Some use two or four eggs.

*  Traditionally, this pie is made from the juice of the Key lime, a small
yellow citrus fruit quite different from the larger and more familiar
Persian lime. Key limes are very sensitive to cold and in the U.S. have
never been grown above the very southern tip of Florida. Bad weather and
disease have killed off so many of them that the only remaining grove is a
private one on one of the Keys, so you cannot buy Key lime juice in the
U.S.  any more. Key limes are still grown widely in South America and
probably elsewhere on other continents.

There is something called Key West lime juice sold in pint bottles which
everybody uses instead now, which seems to be regular lime juice slightly
concentrated.  It's widely available in Florida and occasionally elsewhere
in the U.S. It's also available via mail order from Key West Aloe,
telephone +1 305 294 5592 or 800-327-5866. In a pinch, you can substitute
regular lime juice, though it doesn't produce quite the bright yellow
custard that traditionalists like. You may have to use extra juice, because
Persian limes are less acidic than Key limes.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1-2 hours chilling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

gelatin mixture. Place over low heat, stirring constantly, until gelatin
dissolves, about 6 min. Remove from heat and add rind. Cool. Beat egg
whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually add remaining 1/3 c sugar and
beat until stiff. Fold in gelatin mixture. Turn into pastry shell and chill
until firm. Garnish with whipped cream and lime slices if desired. Note: To
make lime chiffon cream pie, fold in 1/2 c heavy cream, whipped before
turning into pastry shell. This is a much lighter pie than the one using
sweetened consensed milk, and I think it has a more of the flavor of Key
limes.

Key Lime Pie *** (Srrh02a)

pies, deserts, american

5 each egg yolks
1 can sweetened condensed milk
2/3 cup key lime juice; or
1/3 cup lemon juice
1/3 cup lime juice
5 each egg whites
6 tablespoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon cream of tarter
1 each baked pie crust; or
1 each graham cracker crust

If there is one thing most Florida Crackers will agree
on is the proper way to make a Key Lime Pie..and one
thing we hate is how many variations there are..green
food coloring? UGH! Most of the Key lime trees in
Central Fla. have been frozen so its hard to get fresh
juice.Don't use the bottled.We use equal amounts from
Persian limes and lemons. Sweetened condensed milk was
used before re- frigeration. Eagle Brand is the old
stand-by but any brand will do. You may use a graham
cracker crust - most folks do now because it takes
chilling better than the regular pastry crust does..We
have trouble here in Florida with humidity so
sometimes we use whipped cream as a topping instead of
meringue. I always take a chance with the meringue and
if it runs the kids just say "Mom has made Key Lime
Soup again" and eat it anyhow. This recipe is the way
all my Conch relatives make it. They've been in Key
West since 1800. Beat egg yolks until pale yellow.
Blend in milk and add lime juice stirring unitl
smooth. Pour into pie shell and top with meringue or
whipped cream. Meringue Beat egg whites at high speed
until foamy. Add cream of tarter; beat until soft
peaks form ~ reduce speed and gradually add sugar.
Beat again at high speed until soft glossy peaks form.
Heap on pie , sealing the edges well and bake in 350F
oven approximately 15 minutes. Cool at room
temperature then chill. Youall enjoy ya hear... Babs

Key Lime Pie 2

pies, deserts

1  9-inch graham-cracker pie shell
5 large egg yolks
14 oz (1 can) sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup key lime juice (or 3/4 c regular li; me juice)
      ----OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS----
1  lime, finely grated zest
1 cup heavy whipping cream
3 tablespoon confectioners' sugar

Note on the limes:  *Key* limes are supposed to be
used - they're a bit smaller and are more tart than
the regular limes you see in the market. Ask your
grocer if he/she can get 'em - they make a better pie.
Because the key limes are more tart, you have to use a
bit less juice than when you have the regular ones...

Directions: Preheat the oven to 350F. Put the yolks
into a large bowl and beat 'em with a fork or a wire
whisk. Don't kill 'em, just blend 'em together. Then
slowly blend in the condensed milk, a bit at a time.
Then do the same for the lime juice. The next step is
optional ~ you can either blend in the grated rind, or
you can sprinkle it on top of the pie before baking,
or you can leave it out altogether.  My personal
preference is to blend it in.

Now - pop it in your preheated oven and bake for 13-15
minutes.

While it's baking, whip the cream, slowly adding the
confectioner's sugar while you're whipping.

After it's done baking, let it cool for an hour or so
on a wire rack, then transfer it to the refrigerator
to chill.  Some people like it at room temperature,
but I prefer it chilled.  If you leave it out *too*
long, it goes runny.

Now that it's chilled, you can use the whipped cream
to garnish the whole pie, induvidual slices, or

lice of lime split & twisted.

Serve with strong, hot, black coffee.  Preferably with
a shot of Bushmill's added.

Key Lime Pie Cooked

pies

3/8 cup lime juice
1  lime or lemon rind grated
1  eggs
1  pie shell 9 inch water hot
1/4 teaspoon salt water

Beat the egg yolks, add the lime juice, grated rind,
hot water, salt and 1/2 cup of sugar.Cook this mixture
in a double boiler until it thickens. Add 1/2 cup of
the sugar(or what is remainder) to the stiffly beaten
egg whites. Fold into the cooked mixture and spoon
into the pie shell. Bake in 350 degree oven for 10
minutes. This pie can be garnished with whipping
cream. Because of the danger of uncooked egg yolks
this recipe is often as alternative to the older
versions. Especially in the United States it is
recommended that uncooked egg yolks should not be used
under any circumstances.

Key Lime Pie***Rmbn28b

fruits, pies, deserts

1 can (14 0unces) sweetened conden
4 each egg yolks
1/3 each to 1/2 cup bottled key lime
1 each unbaked 9 graham cracker pi
1 single whipped cream for garnish

This is mighty tasty and quite easy to make: Pre-heat
oven to 325. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together
sweetened con. milk and egg yolks until well-blended.
Slowly stir in the lime juice ( for more tart flavor,
use 1/2 cup juice), stirring gently just until
blended. Pour into pie crust and bake for 10 minutes.
Allow to cool at room temperature, then chill before
serving. Top with whip cream, if desired...I think
it's best with the whipped cream. Note: This recipe
leaves room in the crust for whipped cream. If more
filling is desired, increase the filling proportions
by 1/2.

King Arthur's French Apple Pie

pies

      ----CRUST----
1 cup king arthur unbleached all-
1  purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening
1 tablespoon ice water
      ----FILLING----
8 cup apples, peeled, cored and sliced*
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup king arthur unbleached all- purpose; flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmet
      ----TOPPING----
1 cup king arthur unbleached all- purpose; flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup firm butter

CRUST: Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Put the flour and
salt in a bowl big enough to work in half the
shortening with your pastry blender. Put the remaining
shortening in the blend till it looks mixed, but
lumpy. It's okay to handle the mix at this point, but
once you start to add the ice water, overhandling will
make the crust tough, so try to keep handling to a
minimum. The water should be ice cold and added
gradually, mixing a little with a spoon after each
addition. When dough starts to hold together a bit you
can grab hold of it with your hands to form it into a
ball. Be sure to use plenty of flour on your hands and
on the wooden board, where you'll roll it out.
Transfer the dough to a floured board. Roll the dough
as thinly and evenly as possible. Transfer dough to
pie pan. FILLING: *Recommended apples: Paula Reds are
first choice, or Cortlands Once the apples are
processed they can be mixed with the other
ingredients. If the apples aren't very juicy, you may
want to cut back on the amount of flour a little. Add
cinnamon and nutmeg. TOPPING: Cut the butter with a
knife then mix it with the other ingredients. Mixture
should be a little lumpy. Spread evenly over the top
of the apples. Bake pie in a preheated 425 degree oven
for 15 minutes. then reduce heat to 350 and bake for
an additional 30 minutes.

Kos Lemon Pie

pies, deserts, greek

1  karen mintzias
      ----PASTRY----
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 tablespoon finely grated lemon peel
1 pinch salt
8 tablespoon unsalted butter  cut into small pie; ces
2  egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
      ----FILLING----
8 tablespoon unsalted butter  at room temperatur; e
1/3 cup honey
5  egg yolks
1 1/2 cup ground blanched almonds
2  lemons; juiced
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup superfine sugar water
1  lemon; juiced
      ----FOR SERVING----
1  confectioners' sugar; sifted

To make the pastry, sift the flour and confectioners'
sugar into a large cold bowl, stir in the grated lemon
zest and salt, and add the butter. Quickly and lightly
rub the mixture together with your fingers until it
resembles coarse meal.  Beat the egg yolks and vanilla
together and stir into the flour mixture.  Pull the
dough together into a ball with your fingers, adding
cold water only if necessary to make a soft dough.
Tightly cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30
minutes.

Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven
to 375 F.

Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the pastry
to fit a 9- to 10-inch tart pan with a removable
bottom.  To transfer the pastry, wrap it around the
rolling pin, lift above the pan, and unroll over the
rim.  With your thumb and knuckle, gently press the
pastry into the pan, then roll the rolling pin over
the rim to trim the edges.  Line with aluminum foil
and bake 6 to 8 minutes or until just set.  Set aside,
and lower the oven temperature to 325 F.

To make the filling, beat the butter and honey with an
electric mixer or by hand until pale and creamy.  Beat
in the egg yolks one at a time.  Then stir in the
almonds, the juice of 2 lemons (reserve the zest,
removed in thin strips), and the cream.  Pour into the
pastry shell and lightly smooth the top with a
spatula.  Bake 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown
and set.

Meanwhile, combine the superfine sugar, reserved lemon
zest, and water in a sugar pan or small heavy
saucepan.  Slowly bring to a boil, then simmer 6
minutes or until the syrup lightly coats the back of a
metal spoon.  Set aside to cool slightly.

Add the remaining lemon juice to the barely warm syrup
and strain, reserving the zest.  Pour the syrup over
the warm pie, remove from the pan, and liberally
sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and the reserved
zest. Serve immediately.

Note: To make the pastry in the food processor, chill
the processor bowl and metal blade in the refrigerator
for 1 hour.  Working very quickly, process the flour,
sugar, lemon zest, and butter until the mixture
resembles coarse meal.  Add the egg yolks and vanilla
and pulse just to mix.  (It is unlikely that you will
need to add water.)  Wrap and refrigerate.

Mabel Kirk's Butternut Squash Pie

pies

      ----CRUST----
2 2/3 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening
7 tablespoon ; water, ice
      ----FILLING----
2 cup butternut squash; cut into 1 cubes, cooked
1 cup evaporated milk
3  eggs; lightly beaten
1/2 cup sugar, brown
1/2 cup sugar, granulated
2 tablespoon flour
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon cloves, ground
1 teaspoon butter; melted

Heat oven to 400.

For crust, combine flour and salt in med bowl.  Cut in shortening with
pastry blender or two knifes until flour forms pea-sized chunks.
Sprinkle one tablespoon of the ice water over one small section of
flour mixture and mix lightly with a fork.  Repeat, rotating bowl,
one section at a time.

Form two-thirds of dough into lg ball, then press down to form a 5-6"
diameter "pancake" (remainder of dough can be rolled out into a rect-
angle, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, rolled and cut into little
pinwheels, brushed with butter and a sugar-water glaze and baked sepa-
rately). Sprinkle flour on rolling (preferably taped-down pastry
cloth) and, with flour-dusted rolling pin, roll dough into circle
until dough is about 1/4" thick.  Trim one inch larger than inverted
10" Pyrex pie plate. Carefully roll pastry onto rolling pin, then
unroll it onto right-side-up pie plate.  Press into pie plate.  Fold
edge under. Flute 1/2" high edge. Cover with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate.

Combine all ingredients in mixing bowl and mix at med speed for 5
min. Pour into chilled pastry shell. Cover edge of pie with long
strip of aluminum foil to prevent ovebrowning. Bake 10 min at 400F.
Reduce heat to 375 F and bake for 25 min.  Remove foil.  Bake 10-15
min more, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean and crust
is golden brown.

Macadamia Bavarian Cream Pie

pies

1  stephen ceideburg
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup coarsely chopped unsalted macadamia; nuts
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon butter
1  filling:
1/2 teaspoon gelatin
1 tablespoon dark rum
1 cup milk
6 tablespoon sugar, divided
3  eggs, separated
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoon butter
3/4 cup coarsely chopped macadamia nut brit; tle
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
1  one 9-inch baked pie shell
1  topping:
1/2 cup heavy cream
1  nut brittle:
1  unflavored vegetable oil

This pie has a crisp, golden crust and a delicious creamy filling
dotted with nut brittle. It's a perfect ending to a simple meal.

Macadamia brittle: Spread a thin film of vegetable oil on a baking
sheet. Sprinkle baking soda over nuts in a small bowl.

Combine water and sugar in a 1 1/2 quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and
place over low heat; swirl to moisten the sugar. Heat until the sugar
dissolves. Add the butter, raise heat to medium, and boil the mixture
until it registers 280 degrees F. on a candy thermometer, 5 to 7
minutes.

Remove from heat, immediately add nuts, and stir briefly just to
combine. (Too much stirring will deflate the brittle.) The mixture
will foam. Pour onto the oiled baking sheet. Set aside to cool and
harden.

When completely cool, store in an airtight metal container for up to 1
month at room temperature. Makes
1    cup.

Filling: Sprinkle gelatin over rum to soften. Combine the milk with 2
tablespoons of the sugar in a 1 1/2 quart saucepan. Set over medium
heat and bring to a boil. Whisk the egg yolks with 2 tablespoons
sugar and the cornstarch in a small bowl. When the milk boils, remove
from heat, and pour about half into the yolk mixture, whisking to mix
completely. Pour this mixture into the milk, return to medium heat
and cook, whisking constantly as mixture begins to thicken. Whisk
until mixture is smooth and very thick; remove from heat. Add gelatin
and stir until dissolved. Add butter, and whisk until melted.

Pour into a bowl to cool. Place plastic wrap on top of the cream to
prevent a film from forming.

When cool, chop brittle in food processor into coarse piec- es, about
1 cup. Reserve 1/4 cup for decoration. Whip the 3/4 cup heavy cream
with vanilla until very soft peaks form. Whip egg whites with 1
tablespoon sugar until stiff, shiny peaks form. Fold brittle into the
cream filling. Then fold in the whites alternately with the whipped
cream. Pour filling into the cooled baked crust. Refrigerate at least
1 hour, or until set. Cover with plastic wrap.

Topping: Whip cream with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar until soft peaks
form, then spread over pie. Sprinkle the reserved brittle on top. PER

Madison's Tart Dough

pies, misc

1 cup unbleached white flour
3/8 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon cold unsalted butter; cut into small cubes
1 1/2 tablespoon solid vegetable shortening
2 1/2 tablespoon ice water, more if necessary

This versatile dough can be the basis for either fruit or meat pies.
The recipe comes from Deborah Madison's "The Greens Cookbook"
(Bantam, 1987).

COMBINE THE FLOUR AND SALT in a bowl; then add the butter and
shortening. With your hands, work the fat and flour together, sliding
and flattening the mixture between your palms, or thumb and
fingertips, until the butter and shortening are evenly distributed.
Add 2 1/2 tablespoons cold water and lightly work it into the flour,
using your fingers, slightly cupped together, or a fork. Gather the
dough into a ball, sprinkle a few drops of water over any remaining
dry ingredients and gather them together. Cover the dough with waxed
paper or plastic wrap, flatten it into a disk, and let it rest at
least 30 minutes in the refrigerator before using. The dough can also
be frozen at this point for future use. When you are ready to roll
the dough, lightly flour the work surface and the top of the dough.
If it is stiff from the cold, let it sit for 20 minutes before you
roll it out. Roll it out with firm, even strokes into a circle about
1/8-inch thick. Pick it up on the rolling pin and slide it onto the
pie dish or tart mold. Or, alternatively, fold it into quarters, lay
it with the point in the center of the pan, then unfold. Trim the
edges, leaving an overhang of an inch or so; then fold the overhang
under and crimp the edge. To partially pre-bake the crust, first
freeze the empty shell until it is quite firm. If you intend to
freeze the crust for an extended period of time, wrap it in foil.
When ready to use, preheat the oven to 425F. Set the frozen tart
shell directly into the oven and bake until the crust has a "set"
appearance and is just beginning to color, about 8-to-10 minutes.
While the crust is baking, check to see that the bottom is now
swelling with steam and air. If it does, prick it lightly with a
paring knife. More traditionally, the crust may be prebaked unfrozen,
first lining it with buttered foil, filling the foil with pie weights
or dry beans, then baking, as above, until the edges are set and
slighted browned. Makes 1 9-Inch Pie or Tart

Magic Black Bottom Pie

pies, pastries

1  vanilla wafers or graham  crackers
15 oz can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup lemon juice
2  eggs; seperated, yolks not  bea

Meringue For Pies

pies, pastries

3  egg whites
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 pinch salt
6 tablespoon sugar

Beat the egg whites till they form soft peaks.  Add the cream of
tartar and salt and continue beating till the whites are stiff but
not dry. Add sugar, a little at a time, beating it in well. Spread
the meringue over the pie, being certain to cover the surface
completely, including the edge of the crust. If you are deft with the
pastry tube, you may pipe the meringue over the pie, using a #6
rosette tube. Bake the meringue at 350 degrees 15 to 18 minutes, or
until it is lightly browned. Note: The secret to keeping the meringue
from shrinking is to make sure there are no gaps between the pie
crust and the meringue.

Mexican Mocha Pie

mexican, pies, deserts

1 pkg unflavored gelatin
1/3 cup coffee flavored liqueur
1/2 cup cold water
4  eggs
3 oz semisweet chocolate
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon butter or margarine
1/4 cup almonds; slivered
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
1  9-in pie shell; baked

Sprinkle gelatin over 1/2 cup cold water in a measuring cup; let
soften about 5 min. Seperate eggs, placing 2 egg whites in small bowl
of an electric mixer and 4 egg yolks in top of a double
boiler.(refrigerate remaining whites for use in another recipe) Let
egg whites warm to room temerature.
Beat yolks slightly with a wooden spoon; stir in gelatin mixture,
semisweet chocolate and 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Cook over hot, not
boiling water, stiring until melted, about 10 min. Remove mixture from
heat, stir in coffee flavored liqueur.
Pour chocolate mixture into a medium-sized bowl; place in a large
bowl of ice water. Stir mixture occasionally until it cools and is
the consistency of unbeaten egg whites, about 15 minutes. Toast
almonds: In a small skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add
almonds; cook, stirring, just until golden brown. Cool.
In chilled bowl of an electric mixer, whip heavy cream until stiff;
refrigerate. Meanwhile, with electric mixer (use clean beaters), beat
egg whites just until soft peaks form when beaters are slowly raised.
Gradually beat in remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, beating until stiff
peaks form when beaters are raised.
With wire whisk or rubber spatula, using an under-and-over motion,
fold beaten egg whites and 1 1/2 cups of the whipped cream into the
chocolet mixture. Cover and refrigerate remaining whipped cream. Turn
filling into pie shell, spreading filling evenly. Refridgerate until
filling is firm, about 3 hours.
Chop the toasted almonds. Spoon the remaining whipped cream into a
pastry bag fitted with a #6 tip; pipe whipped cream along inside edge
of the pie crust. With a spoon, sprinkle almonds around tne inside
edge of the whipped cream. Refridgerate until ready to serve.
Variation: add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to chocolate mixture. NOTE: We
advise caution when preparing recipes that call for raw eggs to avoid
exposure to salmonella.

Microwave Pecan Pie

pies, microwave

1/3 cup butter
1 cup light corn syrup
3  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup dark brown sugar
1 cup pecan halves

In 1 quart glass measuring bowl (I use pyrex), melt 1/3 c butter,
usually 30 seconds on high. Stir in remaining ingredients. Pour into
baked pie crust shell. Cook on medium, 18 to 20 minutes. Turn once
during cooking.

Hints: White sugar is made by removing the molasses, so I simply
reverse the process to make my own brown sugar. Add as much or as
little molasses to your white sugar as you like. I do the same thing
to light corn syrup.

Mock Mincemeat

pies, preserves, relishes

15 lb green tomatoes
15 large apples
3 lb raisins
1 cup cider vinegar
12 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoon cinnamon
2 tablespoon allspice
2 tablespoon cloves
5 teaspoon salt

Wash, core and chop unpeeled green tomatoes.  Grind tomatoes in a food
processor, food mill or the old-fashioned way in a sausage grinder.
Drain through a colander lined with cheesecloth into a pan. Measure
juice after draining and discard. Place tomatoes in a large enamel or
stainless steel kettle; add a measurement of water equal to the
amount of discarded tomato juice. Bring mixture to a boil.  Remove
from heat and drain mixture as above. Measure juice and discard.
Return tomatoes to kettle, add water equal to amount of water
discarded. Bring to a boil and repeat draining process. Return
tomatoes to kettle and add amount of water equal to discarded tomato
juice. Wash, core and chop apples. Add apples, raisins, vinegar,
sugar, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and salt to tomato mixture. Cook
until thick (1 to 1 1/2 hours), stirring frequently. Mixture will
stick and burn quickly. Ladle hot mincemeat into hot sterilized jars,
leaving 1" headspace. Adjust caps.  Process 20 minutes in boiling
water bath. Note: This mincemeat can be used as a pie filling for
cakes, in cookies or eaten as you would jelly on biscuits, English
muffins or toast. It also makes a great topping for ice cream. One
quart of mincemeat is sufficient for a 9-inch pastry shell.

Mom's Homemade Apple Pie

pies

6 large macintosh apples, sliced
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1  crust:
2 cup flour
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup milk
5 dash salt

Prepare the crust by mixing the flour, oil, milk, and salt. Separate
into two balls, and put each between 2 pieces of wax paper to roll
out, as the crust will be very flaky. Make bottom crust and place in
8-9 inch pie plate, depending upon size you want.

Preheat the oven to 425 F

In a large bowl, put the apples, sugar, and spices. Cut through with a
knife to create the appearance of chopped apples. Put mixture in pie
plate, and dot with a few pats of butter and a few teaspoons of flour.

Roll top crust out, and put on pie. Slit the pie, and put in oven. Be
sure to put a lining underneath the pie or a cookie sheet as the pie
is sure to run over. Bake at 425 degrees for 10 minutes, and then
reduce oven heat to 350 and bake for 50 minutes or until both top and
bottom crusts are brown.

Remove from oven and cool on wire rack. Prepare the following glaze:

3/4 cup confectioners' sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla milk to make a glaze

While the pie is still hot, brush this glaze on top of the pie and be
sure that the glaze drips into the slits.

Cool, and serve with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream.

This recipe comes from my mother-in-law who worked in a bakery in
Kilkeel, County Down, Northern Ireland in the 1940's. It is the
flakiest crust you will ever make.

use 2/3 cup concentrate plus 1/3 cup granulated fructose. Commercial
fruit sweeteners are available at health food stores. Good juices to
use are apple, orange, pineapple, pineapple- orange, and grape.

Mother's Squash Pie

pies

1 cup milk
1 1/2 cup mashed cooked butternut squash
3/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 large eggs
1  9 pie shell

Because of its Thanksgiving associations, pumpkin has become the
pre-eminent squash for pie-making. Many 19th century connoisseurs,
however, insisted that other winter squashes had a more refined
flavor. This recipe (Mabel Gray's from "Yankee Magazine's Great New
England Recipes," 1983) would also work with acorn and other squashes.

Heat milk and squash together in double boiler. In bowl, mix sugar,
flour, salt, ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon. Then add eggs. Beat well
with rotary beater. Add mixture to milk and squash in double boiler.
Stir together well. Do not boil.

Pour warm filling into pie shell. Bake at 400'F. 10 minutes, then
reduce heat to 350'F. and bake until pie sets, about 15-20 minutes.
Makes 6-8 servings.

Mrs. Beeton's Steak & Kidney Pie

main dish, meats, pies

1 each flaky pastry
      ----FILLING----
600 gm chuck/blade steak
3 each 15 ml spoons plain flour
1 each 5 ml spoon salt
1/2 each 2.5 ml spoon ground pepper
2 each medium onions
250 ml beef stock
2 each sheep or 150g ox kidneys
      ----GLAZE----
1 each beaten egg (or)
1  milk

Wipe the steak and trim off any excess fat.  Cut the steak into
1-2 cm cubes.  Mix the flour, salt, & pepper in a bag or deep bowl.
Toss the cubes of meat in the seasoned flour and put them in a 1
litre pie dish. Skin and chop the onions and sprinkle between the
meat. Skin, core, and cut the kidneys before mixing with the steak
and onions. Pour in the stock to quarter fill the dish.
Roll out the pastry and use to cover the dish. Trim the edge and
flute.  Make a small hole in the centre of the lid and decorate with
leaves of pastry. Make a pastry rose or tassel to cover the hole
after baking.
Bake the pie in a very hot oven (230C/450F) until the pastry is
risen and brown.  Bake the tassel or rose blind. Reduce the oven to
moderate (180C/350F) and, if necessary, place the pie on a lower
shelf. Cover with greaseproof paper to prevent the pastry from
overbrowning and continue cooking for about 2 hours until the meat is
quite tender when tested with a skewer.  Heat the remaining stock and
pour in enough to fill the dish by funnelling it through the hole in
the pastry. Insert the tassel, or rose and serve.

Mushroom & Celery Root Galette W Mushroom Sau

pies, sauces

      ----NORMA WRENN----
1 small celery root (3/4 lb)
2 medium leeks
1 lb white mushrooms
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion; finely chopped
1  lemon; halved
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
1  salt/freshly ground pepper
2 medium garic cloves; minced
1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley
1  + more for garnish; chopped
1  mushroom sauce
1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream
2 tablespoon freshly grated parmesan or
1  asiago cheese
1  yeast dough or pie dough
1 large egg; beaten

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Thoroughly scrub the celery root,
trim off a thin piece from both ends and peel; set aside the
trimmings. Thinly slice the celery crosswise, then cut into 1/4-inch
dice. Transfer to a nonreactive bowl and cover with cold water to
prevent discoloration. Trim the root end and the dark green portion
of the leeks; set aside. Coarsely chop the remaining white and tender
green portion of the leek and rinse well but don't dry. Trim off the
mushroom stems and set aside. Slice the mushroom caps crosswise
1/2-inch thick. (Use the celery root trimmings, leek trimmings and
mushroom stems to make the Mushroom Sauce.)

In a large nonreactive skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil oer low
heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the diced celey root to the
skillet. Add the chopped leeks and onion. Squeeze half a lemon over
the vegetables, add the tarragon and cook until the liquid is
evaporated and the vegetables are tender and just beginning to brown,
about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer the mixture
to a nonreactive bowl.

In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over high
heat until it starts to shimmer.  Stir inthe mushrooms until coated
with oil, then squeeze the remaining lemon half over them. Cook until
the mushrooms begin to color, about 2 minutes.  Season with the
parsley and salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and stir in the
celery root mixture. Fold in 1/2 cup of the Mushroom Sauce, teh creme
fraiche and the Parmesan.

On a lightly floured baking sheet without sides, roll out the galette
dough into a 14-inch round. (Alternatively, divide the dough into 4
even pieces and roll into 8-inch rounds.)  Spread the filling over
the dough, leaving a 2-inch border.  Fold up and pleat the border of
the dough. Brush the dough with the beaten egg. Bake the galette
until golden, about 30 minutes for Yeast Dough and 40 minutes for Pie
Dough.

To serve, pour 1/4 cup of the Mushroom Sauce over the top of the
Mushroom Sauce over the top of the galette. Garnish with chopped
parsley. Cut the galette in wedges and spoon some of the sauce over
each one.

My-Sweet-Potato-Pie

pies

4  huge sweet potatoes (really
1  big ones)
5  eggs
2 cup firmly packed light brown
1  sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon (to 1 1/2 ts) ginger (depends on ho; w much you like ginger)
1 teaspoon (to 1 1 /2 ts) cinnamon (ditto abov; e)
1/2 teaspoon (to 1 ts) ground cloves (ditto abov; e)
2 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup whole milk - none of this
1  skim or 1% stuff --
1 cup melted unsalted butter -
1  okay you can use salted
1  butter
2  nine inch pie shells

Bake the sweet potatoes until they are fully cooked...all soft and
mushy. (Hint:  bake them on a foil covered jellyroll pan...they tend
to be messy when cooking.) When the potatoes are fully cooked, remove
from oven and cool a bit...then cut one potato in about half, cover
it in butter and eat it right up!!! You need only three and a half
taters and they are so darn good fresh from the oven.

Cook the remaining taters and then remove the skins....mash them up
in a big ole bowl real good. Add the milk and dump the eggs where
most of the milk has settled and beat 'em with our electric mixer
(the KitchenAid Mixer bowl won't hold all the mix so use a hand
mixer...) Slosh all the dry ingredients into the bowl and beat
really, really well. Sweet taters are filled with FIBER and they need
a good deal of mixing. Lastly, add the melted butter, one half cup at
the time, mixing very well. Then, just for good measure, beat the
dickens out of the whole thing for a couple more minutes.

This should make enough for two good size pies and just enough left
over for great bowl scraping.  Pour the mix into the shells, bake at
400 degrees for about an hour or until a knife is inserted and
removed from the pie clean.  Start checking in about 45
minutes...just to be on the safe and not burned side. Remove from
oven, cool, eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner

Never-Fail Pie Crust

pies

1 cup crisco or other good
1  shortening
1/2 cup boiling water
1  pinch of salt
3 cup flour.

Mix shortening, salt and boiling water in a large bowl. Whip with a
fork until fluffy.  Add the flour all at once. Stir until it leaves
the side of the bowl. Roll between two sheets of wax paper. Makes
enough for a two-crust pie.  If using for two one-crust pies, bake at
375 10-12 minutes or until light brown before adding filling.

This also freezes well if made up ahead, if you like to have pie
shells on hand for one-crust pies.

No-Roll Pie Dough

pies, misc

1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoon sugar
1 pinch salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
6 tablespoon cold butter
1 large egg

COMBINE THE FLOUR, sugar, salt and baking powder in a mixing bowl.
Cut the butter into six or eight pieces and distribute over the dry
ingredients. Rub in the butter finely, using fingertips or pastry
blender, until the mixture resembles a fine powder. DO NOT WORK THE
MIXTURE TO THE POINT WHERE IT BEGINS TO STICK TOGETHER. Beat egg with
a fork in a small bowl and stir into the flour-butter mixture: It
will remain dry and crumbly. Turn the dough out into a buttered 10-
to 11-inch removable-bottom tart pan or a 9-inch Pyrex pie pan.
Distribute the crumbly mixture evenly around the bottom and side of
the pan, pressing it into place with floured fingertips. As you press
the dough into place, it will adhere together and line the pan. Avoid
pressing the dough too hard or it will become thin in places. After
pressing the dough into the pan, inspect the surface for any
excessively thick or thin spots and press them even before
proceeding. Slide dough into a plastic bag and chill several hours or
overnight, or while preparing the filling. Makes one 10- or 11-inch
tart shell or 9-inch pie shell.

Old-Fashioned Currant Tart

pies, deserts, fruits/nuts

      ----PASTRY DOUGH----
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  egg yolk
1 1/4 cup cake flour
      ----PASTRY CREAM----
1 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
3  egg yolks
3 tablespoon flour
1 teaspoon vanilla
      ----FINISHING----
3 pint fresh red currants  rinsed and stem; med
1/2 cup toasted, sliced almonds
1  confectioners' sugar
      ----GLAZE----
1 cup red currant jelly
2 tablespoon kirsch

FOR THE DOUGH: Beat the butter and sugar with the paddle on medium
speed until very soft and light. Beat in the vanilla and the yolk and
continue beating until smooth and shiny, about 3 more minutes. Stop
the mixer, sift the cake flour and add to the butter mixture. Pulse
the mixer on and off to incorporate the flour. Scrape the dough onto
a piece of plastic, wrap and chill it until firm. FOR THE PASTRY
CREAM: Combine the milk and half the sugar in a saucepan over low
heat. Whisk the yolks with the remaining sugar and sift the flour
over and whisk it in. Beat 1/3 of the boiling milk into the yolk
mixture and return the remaining milk to a boil. Beat the yolk
mixture into the boiling milk and continue beating until the cream
thickens and comes to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the
vanilla. Scrape the cream onto a clean plate, cover with plastic wrap
and chill. Roll the dough and fit it into a 10-to-11-inch tart pan.
Cut a disk of parchment paper to fit the inside of the dough and fill
with dried beans. Preheat oven to 325F. Bake the tart shell about 20
minutes, until set. Remove the paper and beans and continue baking 5
minutes more to color the pastry. Do not over-bake. Cool the shell in
the pan. Spread the cooled pastry cream on the cooled tart shell.
Arrange the currants on the pastry cream. Bring the jelly and kirsch
to a boil and strain. Reduce to thicken if necessary. Brush the glaze
on the berries. Edge the tart with the almonds and sprinkle the
almonds with the confectioners' sugar.

3/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup water; or peach juice
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon lemon juice
1  9 inch pie crust; thawed

* or canned, enough for one pie

Combine sugar, butter and flour to make crumbs. Sprinkle half this mixture
in the bottom of an unbaked pie crust. Place peach halves with cut side up
in pie shell. Cover with remaining crumb mixture. Add fruit juices or water
if needed. Bake at 375 degrees for 40-45 minutes. May be served with
whipped cream. Makes 1 (9 inch) pie.

(Taken from the Mennonite Community Cookbook-Maggie W. Moyer)

NOTES:

This week I thought I'd try a dessert recipe since Brandon's birthday is
Wednesday and his request was peach pie. This peach pie is one easy dessert
too. You can make your own pie crust, or buy a frozen one at the store to
save time (although I recommend making one). I bought some canned peaches
in light syrup and plan to add about 2 tablespoons sugar or less. Judge for
yourself as to how sweet you want it to be. I also will add a little
cinnamon to the crumb mixture. Yum! Peach pie is one of my favorites. Wish
me luck and Brandon a "Happy Birthday"!

This custard pie is similar in style to key lime pie, but flavored
with orange and topped with meringue rather than whipped cream ++ to
use up the egg whites that otherwise go to waste.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  To make the filling, stir together the
milk, egg yolks, orange juice and orange liqueur. Pour into the
prepared pie shell and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until just set.
Remove from the oven and turn the heat to 450F.

To make the meringue, combine the egg whites and sugar in a metal
bowl. Set in a pan of simmering water (or place the pan directly over
lowest heat if desired) and stir for a minute or two ++ your clean
index finger is t;he best tool for stirring ++until the sugar has
dissolved and the mixture is warm.  Remove from heat, add the cream
of tartar and salt, and beat until the meringue stand in soft peaks.
Spread over the pie and return to the oven for about 5 minutes, until
golden. Cool to room temperature.

Original Key Lime Pie

fruits, pies, pastries, deserts

1 each unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup water
2/3 cup sugar; divided
1/2 cup key lime juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon grated lime rind
4 each eggs; separated
1 single 9 baked pastry shell

I got this recipe from a "Cracker," and it will dispute the previous
statement that all will agree on how to make the best Key Lime Pie. My tree
froze, but came back, so we've enjoyed this recipe a lot this year. Mix
together gelatin, 1/3 c sugar and salt in saucepan. Combine slightly beaten
egg yolks, water & lime juice. Add to gelatin mixture. Place over low heat,
stirring constantly, until gelatin dissolves, about 6 min. Remove from heat
and add rind. Cool. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually add
remaining 1/3 c sugar and beat until stiff. Fold in gelatin mixture. Turn
into pastry shell and chill until firm. Garnish with whipped cream and lime
slices if desired. Note: To make lime chiffon cream pie, fold in 1/2 c
heavy cream, whipped before turning into pastry shell. This is a much
lighter pie than the one using sweetened condensed milk, and I think it has
a more of the flavor of Key limes.

Our Lemon Pie

pies, pastries, diabetic

3 tablespoon margarine
10  graham cracker squares
1/2 cup skimmed evaporated milk; cold
1 pkg dream whip
27 pkg equal sweetener
2  egg yolks
2 large lemons; 1/2 cup juice
3  egg whites
3 tablespoon sugar

Melt margarine on medium to low heat.  Roll graham crackers into crumbs
with rolling pin.  Mix crumbs and melted margarine. Pat to make crust on
bottom and sides of pie pan. Chill.

Add cold evaporated milk to Dream Whip (do not add vanilla). Sprinkle in 24
pkg. Equal.  Mix and beat according to directions. Beat egg yolks slightly,
and gradually stir in lemon juice. Gradually fold in the whipped Dream
Whip.  Spread in pie crust.  Turn on broiler so it will get hot. Beat 3 egg
whites frothy (use clean beaters so whites will beat up as fluffy as
possible).  Add 1 tbs. sugar and beat until blended in. Add another tbs.
sugar and 3 Equal pkg. and beat until soft peaks form. Spread meringue over
top. Spread meringue to stick to the edges so it won't shrink when you
broil it.

Put under broiler for 30-60 seconds until meringue is lightly browned. IT
DOESN'T TAKE LONG AT ALL AND IS EASY TO BURN. The flavors will blend better
if you chill for 5 hours.
