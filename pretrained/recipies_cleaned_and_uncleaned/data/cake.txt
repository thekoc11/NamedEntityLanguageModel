cakes, deserts

2 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4  eggs
2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup oil
2 cup grated raw carrots
8 1/2 oz canned crushed pineapple  drained
1/2 cup chopped nuts
      ----VANILLA CREAM CHEESE FROSTIN---
1/2 cup butter or margarine
8 oz cream cheese; softened
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 lb powdered sugar; sifted

Sift together flour, baking powder, soda, salt and cinnamon. Beat
eggs and add sugar. Let stand until sugar dissolves, about 10
minutes. Stir in oil, carrots, drained pineapple and nuts. Turn into
3 greased and floured 9-inch round cake pans or 1 (13- x 9-inch) pan
and bake at 350F 35 to 40 minutes for layer pans and about 55 minutes
for 13- x 9-inch pan, or until cake springs back when lightly
touched. Cool in pans about 10 minutes, then turn onto wire racks to
cool completely.

To make frosting, combine butter, cream cheese and vanilla in large
bowl and beat until well blended. Add powdered sugar gradually,
beating vigorously. If too thick, thin with milk to spreading
consistency. Frost between layers, top and sides of layer cake. Frost
top and sides of sheet cake.

A NORWEGIAN COFFEE CAKE  "KRINGLAS"~

cakes, deserts, breakfast, ethnic, norwegian

1/2 cup margarine.
1 cup sugar.
1 teaspoon vanilla.
1  egg.
1 cup buttermilk.
1 teaspoon soda.
3 cup flour.
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.
1 teaspoon salt.

Try mixing Vanilla and egg  beat until mixed. Add the Buttermilk and
the Soda; (I have used 7up) and sift the dry ingredients into this.
add the rest of the ingredients, mix well. Put the container into the
refrigerator chill over night. Take out and roll small pieces of the
dough into long strips, then form them into a figure eight,(like a
pretzel) put them back into the Refrigerator for about an hour, when
they have raised to approximately what looks to be the right hight.
Bake in a 450 deg pre-heated oven for approximately 6 to 8 minutes, (
May vary with the weather so keep an eye on them).But they should be
a light brown before you remove them. Refrigeration is one of the
keys of "KRINGLA" making. They must be refrigerated in order for them
to get the flavor, you could bake them without refrigeration but you
lose a lot of the flavor. You can also use. A:  OATMEAL. B: RAISINS.
C: WHOLE WHEAT. You can fill them with your favorite filling, Cream
Cheese, Jelly, ETC. you don't need eggs or yeast. They are not too
sweet, and definitely not Boring like a bagel, (Sorry Bagel lovers,
VBG). It is a coffee Bread not like Muffins, which are too sweet, and
also do not have too many calories. This recipe came from a fella
from the town of LOS OSOS CA He is a out of work Carpenter who
started baking and selling these wonderful Rolls, He said that this
is an original recipe that he got from his grandmother, (Yea for the
Grandmas). Ive tried Nuts, and love the cream Cheese one, You could
even use Custard Filling, Ive also used Different flavored oils like
Pure orange oil, Butterscotch, several Berries types. and they turned
out just great.

Applesauce Cake Baked In A Jar

cakes, deserts

2/3 cup shortening
2 2/3 cup sugar
4  eggs
2 cup applesauce
2/3 cup water
3 1/3 cup all-purpose flo sifted
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 teaspoon ground cloves
2/3 cup nuts, chopped (optional)

Preheat oven to 325-degrees.

Sterilize 5 straight-sided Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400- 81400)
canning jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Keep the
lids and rings in the water until you're ready to use them. Remove
the jars from the water and place them on a clean dish towel to
air-dry (up, not upside down). When the jars are cool enough to
handle, grease the insides with shortening (DO NOT use butter,
margarine, PAM or Baker's Secret); set aside.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon
and cloves; set aside.

Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a
time until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and
water. Blend the dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in
the nuts.; set aside. Fill well greased jars half full. Place the
jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll tip over.

Bake for 35 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. like you
would any canned goods.

The method for making the cakes is the same -- no matter which
recipe you use. The only difference will be the ingredients (of
course), the amount of jars needed and the baking times- -that's all,
everything else is the same. Don't limit yourself to the recipes I'm
giving you -- use your favorite quick-bread recipe. I plan on trying
the Carrot Cake recipe I posted.

Applesauce Cake In Jars

cakes, fruits, deserts, canning

1 single ellie collin cmkd93f
2/3 cup shortening
2 2/3 cup granulated sugar
4 each large eggs
2 cup applesauce
2/3 cup water
3 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoon ground cloves
2/3 cup nuts; chopped,optional

Sterilize 8 (12 oz Ball Quilted Crystal - #14400-81400) canning jars,
lids and rings by boiling for 10 minutes. Remove the jars and allow
to air-dry and cool. Leave the  lids and rings in the hot water until
ready to use. Once the jars are cool enough to handle, grease them
(use a pastry brush) with shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's
Secret); set aside. Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in
the eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add
the applesauce and water; set aside. In another bowl, sift together
the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves.
Blend dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in the nuts.
Pour batter into the jars, filling them about 1/2 full. Place jars
onto a cookie sheet or they'll fall over. Bake in a preheated
325-degree oven for 35-40 minutes or until a pick inserted deep into
the center of each cake  comes out clean. Remove jars from the oven,
one-at-a-time (use HEAVY-DUTY MITTS, the jars ARE HOT!); place a lid,
then a ring on  top and screw down tightly.
Place jars onto your counter top to cool. You'll know when the jars
have sealed, you'll hear a "plinking" sound. If you missed the sound,
test them by pressing down on the lids once the jars have
cooled--they shouldn't move at  all.
Store jars in a cool, dry place. They should keep for about a year.
I've only been able to keep them for a few weeks, they don't last
that long around here. They're wonderful for last minute gifts,
especially for single friends.

Rival Co. To assure that baked cakes will slip out easily, grease
inside of jars well. (Lining bottom of jars with waxed paper also
will help.) Cover each jar with a piece of foil greased on one side.
Place greased side down and press foil around edges to seal tightly.
Place jars in crockpot with crockery liner in place. Cover; cook on
high-heat setting for 2 3/4 to 3 hours or till cakes spring back when
touched and a wooden tothpick inserted near the centers comes out
clean. Remove jars from cooker; cool 10 minutes. Unmold cakes; remove
waxed paper. Serve warm or cool with whipped topping, if desired.

Apricot Crumbcake

cakes, deserts, fruits/nuts

      ----CAKE BATTER----
1/2 cup unsalted butter; softened
3/4 cup sugar
1  egg
3 egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
12 medium apricots
      ----CRUMB TOPPING----
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup unsalted butter; melted

Use this recipe with peaches, sour cherries or pineapple with equally
good results.

CAKE BATTER: PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Butter a 10-inch round, 2-inch
deep cake pan and line the bottom with a disk of parchment or wax
paper. In a large mixer bowl, beat the butter and sugar until soft
and light. Add the egg and continue beating until light. Add the
yolks one at a time, beating well between each addition. Beat in the
vanilla. Sift together the flour and baking powder and stir into the
batter. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Rinse and halve
the apricots. Remove the pits with the bowl of a small spoon if they
resist. Arrange the apricot halves cut-side up on the batter in
concentric rows, overlapping slightly, leaving a margin of about
1-inch around the edge. Don't be concerned if the apricots mound
slightly in the center of the cake; the top will even out as the cake
bakes.

CRUMB TOPPING: FOR THE CRUMBS, mix the flour, sugar and cinnamon in a
bowl. Melt the butter and stir it in evenly. Rub the mixture to
coarse crumbs by hand. Scatter the crumbs over the apricots and the
edge of the batter as evenly as possible. Bake the cake 1 hour until
a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool the cake in the
pan for about 15 minutes and invert a plate on it. Invert onto the
plate and lift off the pan. Peel off the paper and invert a rack on
the cake. Invert cake onto the rack, remove the plate and cool.

Apricot Upside Down Cake

cakes

1 text recipe

Another of my scores this weekend was "from SOUP to DESSERT with the
NEW Irradiated PET MILK".

That's a book title believe it or not.  It's copyrighted 1934 by Pet
Milk company.  I was naturally curious as to why they were nuking Pet
Milk in 1934. That screwed up my historical perspective pretty good,
but it turns out that "irradiated" refers to running the milk under
an ultraviolet light to increase vitamin D content, not making it
glow in the dark. So once my reality check had subsided and I paged
through the book, I saw this which made me think of you.

1. In a 9-inch skillet melt 3 tablespoons butter.

2. Remove from heat and sprinkle with 1/2 cup brown sugar.

3. Arrange on sugar 24 canned apricot halves.

Let stand while mixing batter.

4. Beat until very light 2 eggs.

5. Add, while beating, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.

6. Heat to boiling point:  1/4 cup Pet Milk diluted with 1/4 cup
water and 1 Tbl shortening.

7. ea Beat into egg mixture.

8.  Sift together:  1 cup sifted cake flour and1 tsp baking powder.

9. ea Add milk mixture beating quickly but thoroughly.

10. lb over apricots.

11. ea Bake in a moderate oven (350F) for 25 to 30 minutes or until
cake shrinks from sides of pan.  Turn out while warm and serve with
Whipped Pet Milk Topping.

Serves 6.

That's all pretty straight forward.  What it shows in the pictures
but not in the text is that the cake is baked in a cast-iron skillet
like a nice mess of cornbread.

Here's the topping though I can't help but think it's a tad redundant.

WHIPPED PET MILK (as a topping):

Soak for 5 minutes:  1/4 tsp granulated gelatin in 1 tsp cold water.
Scald in top of double boiler:  1/2 cup Pet Milk. Add gelatin and
stir until dissolved. Pour into bowl and chill until icy cold. Then
whip with rotary beater until stiff.

Fold in 1 Tbl powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.

Makes about 1 1/2 cups...Serves 8.

NOTE:  The following flavorings may be substituted for the vanilla: 2
t orange extract 1 t lemon extract 1/2 t almond extract and 1/2
teaspoon lemon extract 1/2 t peppermint extract 4 dr oil of peppermint

Asian Pear & Lyche Strudel

cakes, fruits, deserts, chinese

3 each phyllo dough, sheets
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/3 cup coconut, toasted, - shredded
2 cup lyche, seeded, halved
1/4 cup walnut, roasted, chopped
1/4 cup raisins, soaked in - plum wine
3 tablespoon ginger, candied
1 1/2 cup asian pear, peeled, diced
1 teaspoon zest, lemon
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon juice, lime or
1 tablespoon juice, lemon
1 teaspoon five spice, powder
1 tablespoon wine, plum
1  sugar, confectioner's

Filling: ========

Soak your golden raisins in plum wine overnight or longer.

Depending on the ingredients available to you, mix appropriate
quantities up so as to fill the dough. You can certainly use more or
less of each ingredient to suit your individual tastes. You'll need
about four cups total filling.

Assembly: =========

Spread the two sheets of phyllo dough out on your work surface,
one on top of the other.  Paint the top layer of dough with some of
the melted better and then spread a nice thin layer of toasted
coconut over the entire pastry.

Pour your filling along the long edge of the phyllo dough, and
roll the dough up as tightly as possible (remember to fold in the
ends as you roll so the ends are "sealed") and put on a non-stick
baking sheet.

Paint the top of the roll with melted butter and bake at 350 F
until the dough is golden brown.

When done, take the strudel out of the oven and let it cool on a
rack. Just before serving, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over the
top. Slice the roll on a diagonal for a more attractive presentation.

For elegant presentation, you might serve the strudel pieces on a
plate with slices of kiwi, orange, lemon, and pear as garnish.

Banana Fruit Cake

cakes, fruits, bananas, nuts, vegatarian
vegetarian

3/4 cup butter
2 cup brown sugar
4  eggs
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup walnuts; chopped
3 cup candied fruit
2 cup dates; chopped
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 teaspoon orange rind; grated
1/2 teaspoon orange extract
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cup mashed bananas

Recipe by: Rose Murray, The Christmas Cookbook Great Canadian Prepare
two 2 Litre (9" x 5") loaf pans. Preheat oven to 300 F. In a large
bowl combine the fruit, dates, pineapple and walnuts. Dredge them
with 1/4 cup of the flour.  Sift the remaining flour together with
the baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.
Set aside. Cream the butter, add the sugar and beat until the mixture
is light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Beat in the
orange rind, orange juice and orange extract. Mash the bananas with a
fork.  (A food processor will tend to liquefy the bananas and this
will change the texture of the cake.) Alternately stir the bananas
and the flour mixture into the creamed mixture. Stir in the floured
fruit and nuts. Turn into the prepared pans and bake for 2 hours and
15 minutes, or until  a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake
comes out clean. Cool in the pans for 20 minutes, then turn out onto
racks. Yields about 5 pounds of cake.

Bananas & Pancakes

cakes, deserts, bananas, low fat

1 large or 1-2 small bananas per
1  person
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoon calvados, grand marnier or
1  cointreau
5 fl oz oz orange juice
2 tablespoon molasses sugar
1  egg
4 oz flour
10 fl oz oz lager beer

Make pancakes with lager, flour and egg, and cook in the normal way
(I used a cooking spray to grease a non-stick frying pan). Fold each
pancake in half, and then in half again, so it forms a quarter-circle
(if you're as bad at cooking pancakes as I am, they'll come out in
bits anyway - if so, pretend it didn't happen!), and place them in a
large flan dish.

Peel bananas, cut in half long-ways and in half again cross-ways, and
place face-down on top of the pancakes. Put the remaining ingredients
into a frying pan or small saucepan, and boil for 3-4 minutes, until
just beginning to be syrupy.  Pour over bananas and pancakes, and
bake in a moderate oven (Mark 4 - 350 F) for 20-30 minutes.

I served this with fromage frais (cream substitute) and a chocolate
sauce, for which the recipe follows:

Best Ever Orange Sponge Cake

cakes

6 egg whites (3/4 cup)
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 teaspoon orange juice; fresh
1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour; sifted
1 1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon orange peel; freshly grated
6 egg yolks
1 confectioners sugar

Note: If desired, spray tube pan or kugelhopf pan with nonstick baking
spray before filling with batter and baking. To cool, DO NOT invert on
bottle. Instead place pan on wire rack to cool 30 minutes. Turn cake
out onto wire rack and cool completely. In large bowl of electric
mixer, let egg whites warm to room temperature, about 1 hour. Measure
flour; sift about 2 cups flour once on a sheet of waxed paper; fill
cups lightly to overflowing; with a spatula, cut off excess to make 1
3/4 level cups. Sift flour with salt; set aside. With electric mixer
at medium speed, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually, beat in 1/2
cup of the granulated sugar, 2 tbsp at a time, beating well after
each addition. Continue beating until stiff peaks form when beaters
are slowly raised. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In small bowl of
electric mixer, with the same beaters at high speed, beat egg yolks
until very thick and lemon colored, about 3 minutes. DO NOT UNDER
BEAT. Gradually, beat in remaining 1 cup granulated sugar; continue
beating until mixture is smooth. At low speed, blend flour mixture
and orange juice alternately into egg yolk mixture, beginning and
ending with flour and guiding batter into beaters with scraper. Add
orange peel. With whisk or rubber spatula, using under and over
motion, fold yolk mixture gently into whites. Pour batter into an
ungreased (see note 1) 9 3/4 to 10" x 4 1/2" kugelhopf pan or 10 x 4"
tube pan without removable bottom. Bake 50 to 55 minutes until cake
springs back when pressed with finger. Invert over bottle (see note
1); cool completely. Using an up and down motion, run spatula around
edge of cake and tube. Invert cake and shake to release; place on
serving plate. Sift Confectioners sugar over top of cake. To cut
cake, use knife with serrated edge. Cut gently, going back and forth
with sawing motion.

Best Ever Sponge

cakes, deserts, low fat

      ----2 EGG SPONGE----
2  eggs
1/3 cup caster sugar
2 tablespoon cornflour
2 tablespoon plain flour
2 tablespoon self-raising flour
      ----3 EGG SPONGE----
3  eggs
1/2 cup caster sugar
1/4 cup cornflour
1/4 cup plain flour
1/4 cup self-raising flour
      ----4 EGG SPONGE----
4  eggs
2/3 cup caster sugar
1/3 cup cornflour
1/3 cup plain flour
1/3 cup self-raising flour

This is a favorite never-fail sponge recipe: it does not contain
liquid or butter, which makes it ideal for Swiss rolls. It is simple
to adapt to many flavors and will work as a cake or a roll. Have eggs
at room temperature. Beat whole eggs in small bowl with electric
mixer until thick and creamy (the small bowl is necessary to give
maximum volume to eggs); beating time on a moderately high speed
should be about 7 mins. Add sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time,
beating after each addition until sugar is dissolved.

While eggs and sugar are beating, prepare pans by greasing evenly
(see lift of pan sizes below); and sift dry ingredients together 3
times, to aerate and mix the flours.

When sugar is dissolved, transfer mixture to larger basin; this makes
it easier to fold the ingredients through the egg mixture *it is not
necessary to transfer the 2 egg mixture to a larger basin). Sift the
flours over the egg mixture, use a spatula to lightly fold the flours
through; heavy handling at this stage will give a flat, tough sponge.
Spread mixture evenly into pan, bake in moderate oven for cooking
time specified below. When cooked, sponge will have shrunk very
slightly from side of pan and top of sponge will feel springy when
touched gently with fingertips. Turn sponge immediately onto wire
rack to cool, then reverse sponge so that wire rack does not mark the
top.

Cake Pans and Cooking Times:

2 egg: Deep 20cm round cake pan or recess pan about 20 mins. A deep
pan is preferable rather than a sandwich pan as the sponge will be
less crusty on top because the high sides protect the top during
cooking.

3 egg: 2 deep 17cm cake or sandwich pans about 15 mins, or 25cm x 30cm
Swiss roll pan about 12 mins.

4 egg: 2 deep 20cm round cake pans about 20 mins, or deep 23cm round
cake pan about 40 mins.

Variations:

Citrus:  Beat in 2 teaspoons of your favorite grated citrus rind with
the sugar.  Try lemon, mandarin, lime, orange or grapefruit.

Nut:  Fold in 1/4 cup of any type of ground nuts with the flours.

Chocolate:  Fold in 60g grated dark chocolate with the flours.

Fill and ice sponges as desired.

Keeping time: 2 days.

cakes

3 cup bisquick baking mix
1 cup sugar
1 cup brown sugar; packed
1/4 cup butter or margarine
4  eggs
1  pumpkin
1/4 cup milk
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/4 teaspoon cloves
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
      ----BROWN BUTTER GLAZE----
1/3 cup butter
2 cup powdered sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon hot water; can use up to 6 tbsp.

Heat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour a 12-cup Bundt cake pan.  Beat
all ingredients except Brown Butter Glaze in large mixer bowl on low
speed, scraping bowl several times, for 30 seconds.  Beat on med.
speed, scraping bowl occasionally, for three min.  Spread batter in
pan.  Bake until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean,
about 50 min.  Cool 10 min. Remove from pan.  Cool completely.

BROWN BUTTER GLAZE: Heat butter over med. heat until delicate brown.
Real butter works best for this; margarine is Ok, but butter

enough hot water to make proper consistency for drizzling over cake
(usually only 2-3 tbsps.).

6 oz jello instant choc.pudding
8 oz pkg. sour cream
1/2 cup hot water
1/4 cup oil
3  eggs
12 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips
1  jar smuckers hot fudge.

Mix together everything except the hot fudge.  The batter will be THICK.
Spread into a well greased and floured bundt pan.  If you can still get
Baker's Joy pan spray, that works the best.  Bake at 350 for one hour. Use
the standard toothpick test for doneness.

Turn cake out while still warm.  Top with hot fudge.  Fudge can be heated
by removing the lid and sticking the whole jar in the microwave for a
minute or two.

DON'T SUBSTITUTE THE HOT FUDGE. Only the Smucker's is really sticky
enough. The other brands just run off the cake.

1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cup flour
1 cup applesauce
1 cup egg whites
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 tablespoon lemon extract
1 orange liqueur

Cut pineapple, apricots, and peaches into 1/2" dice and combine in
large bowl.  Add flour, tossing to coat fruit. In separate bowl, sift
tgether sugar, baking powder, and flour.

Preheat oven to 250.

In small bowl combine applesauce, egg whites, vanilla, and lemon
extract. Stir into dried fruit mixture.  Add flour mixture, stirring
until blended. Spoon batter into 9" tube pan, lighly sprayed with
non-stick cooking spray.

Bake 3 hours.  Let cake cool in pan on rack.

Store in covered container in refrigerator one month or longer before

At LAST! I've got the fat free fruitcake recipe. This is SO good. You
won't believe your taste buds.

Now, my grandmother brought me a regular loaf-shaped loaf - meatloaf
sized. She said it made several that size. I'll have to ask her if
she cooked it a different amount of time and if she really let it sit
for a month before digging in. I don't think I could wait that long!

Bran Muffin Mix

breads, cakes

1 cup unprocessed coarse bran
2 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar (or more to taste)
2 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoon salt

Whisk all ingredients together in lge. bowl--mix thoroughly. Measure
2 cups into each of 2 plastic bags. Divide any remaining mix equally.

This mix does not produce a sweet cake-like muffin. Rather full
bodied and textured.  This produces nice contrast when heaped with
orange marmalade.

However, feel free to adjust sugar to taste.  These recipes are meant
to serve only as guidelines.  Tinker with them to your hearts'
delight. They are all "cook-friendly", for the exception of any yeast
raised mixes, which must be handled like one would approach a prima
donna: with respect. Yeast breads are quite tempermental.

Brandied Fruit Cakes (Sharon)

cakes, fruits, holiday, christmas

4 1/2 cup raisins
2 1/4 cup currants
1/2 lb soft butter or margarine
1/2 lb soft shortening
2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon almond extract
12  eggs
1 cup orange juice concentrate
1 (not thawed)
1/2 cup honey
4 1/2 cup unsifted all purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon cloves (ground)
1 cup pitted dates, cut up
2 1/4 cup candied cherries
1 cup blanched almonds, halved

**NOTE**  I take the whole amount of fruit (10 cups) and make a nice
looking mixture.  I don't necessarily use the amounts shown. If the
candied fruit is on sale, I just use more of it than the raisins. I
still end up with the 10 cups, but it is usually more of the fruit
mix and candied pineapple.  The almonds I use are the slivered ones.
Easier to work with... The original recipe called for brandy or grape
juice, but I found that if you substitute the orange juice
concentrate, it has a nicer flavour.

Use 2 tube pans 10x4 each, or 5 loaf pans.  Line pans with 2-3
thicknesses of brown paper or 1 thickness of heavy foil; grease well
with unsalted shortening. (I use lard to grease and don't need to
line with paper)

Wash raisins and currants and dry thoroughly between paper towels.
Beat butter and shorteningtogether very thoroughly; when smooth and
fluffy, add sugar gradually, beating continuously. Blend in vanilla
and almond extract. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each
addition. Beat in orange juice and honey. This may cause the batter
to appear separated, but it will not affect results.  Sift together
remaining dry ingredients. Mix prepared fruits and almonds in large
mixing bowl; add sifted dry ingredients, and mix well to coat pieces.
Scrape egg and butter mixture into bowl, and, using hands, combine
very thoroughly. Fill each pan 3/4 full. Preheat oven to 275F.  Bake
cakes 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 hours, depending on size of pans used. After
first hour or so, place pan of water on bottom of oven to prevent
cakes from drying out. When cakes test done, remove from oven, and
let pans stand on racks until cakes are completely cooled. Remove
from pans, and peel of paper linings. Let ripen 4-5 weeks before
serving. This recipe makes dark moist cake, rich with fruits and
mingled flavors of spices, honey, and the like. If desired, recipe
may be halved with good results.

When they come out of the oven, I let them sit for a few minutes and
then take them out of the pans while still fairly hot. Let them cool
for maybe 15-20 minutes and then pack them while still warm. I pour
1/4 to 1/2 cup brandy (apricot, orange, or cherry) onto the cakes,
wrap in double thickness of Handy wrap, then wrap in tin foil
securely. I then store them in the basement where it is cool and
every couple of days I turn them to make sure that the brandy
diffuses throughout the whole cake. I have NEVER had this recipe fail
me. I am asked for it by most of my family members as I send them for
presents at Christmas. I have tried other recipes, but this one has
the moistest results I have found. By pouring the brandy on AFTER it
is cooked, you get a cake that kicks!! (for our A.A. friends, I make
"dry" ones with no brandy and it still stays moist.)

Brazilian Passion Cake

cakes, deserts

      ----CASHEW NUT CRUST----
1/2 cup unsalted cashews
2 cup vanilla wafer cookie crumbs
4 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
      ----FILLING----
11 ripe passion fruits
2 tablespoon water
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon unflavored powdered gelatin
8 oz cream cheese, softened
1 can (14-oz) sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 cup heavy cream
      ----PASSION FRUIT TOPPING----
3 tablespoon water, divided
1 teaspoon unflavored powdered gelatin
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 ripe passion fruit

Make the cashew nut crust: 1.Position a rack in the center of the
oven and preheat to 350 F. Remove the bottom from an 8 1/2-by-3-inch
springform pan. Trim a 9-inch cardboard cake circle so that it fits
snugly within the curved lip of the bottom of the springform pan.
Cover the bottom with a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, leaving a
2-inch overhang all around the edge. Carefully attach the side of the
pan so you do not tear the foil.

2.In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the
cashews, pulsing the machine on and off, until finely ground.
Transfer the ground cashews to a medium bowl; stir in the cookie
crumbs and melted butter until combined. Press the mixture evenly
onto the bottom and up the side of the prepared pan. Bake the crust
for 12 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool the crust on a wire rack.

Make the filling: 1.Using a serrated knife, cut the passion fruits in
half. Scrape the seeded orange pulp of the fruits into the bowl of a
food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Process the pulp
for 15 to 20 seconds. Pass the passion fruit puree through a fine
sieve into a small bowl. Remove 1/4 cup of the puree to a small cup,
cover and set aside for the passion fruit topping.

2.Place the water and vanilla in a small heatproof cup; sprinkle the
gelatin over the mixture and allow it to soften for 5 minutes . Place
the cup with the softened gelatin in a saucepan with enough water to
come halfway up the side of the cup. Heat the gelatin mixture over
hot, not simmering, water. Stir the gelatin frequently for 3 to 4
minutes, or until the gelatin granules dissolve completely and the
mixture is clear. Remove the pan from the heat.

3.In a medium bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer, beat the cream
cheese for 30 seconds, until smooth. Add the condensed milk and the
reserved passion fruit puree and beat the mixture for an additional
minute, scraping the bottom of the bowl as necessary. Whisk in the
lemon juice and the warm gelatin mixture.

4.In a chilled, medium bowl, using a handheld electric mixer, beat the
cream until soft peaks start to form. Do not overheat. Fold one-third
of the cream into the passion fruit mixture to lighten it. Fold in the
remaining whipped cream.

5.Scrape the filling into the cooled crust. Refrigerate the cake for 3
hours, until the filling is firmly set.

Make the passion fruit topping: 1.Place 2 tablespoons of the water in
a small cup. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water; allow the mixture
to soften for 5 minutes.

2.In a small saucepan, combine the remaining tablespoon water, the
reserved passion fruit puree, and the sugar. Cut the remaining
passion fruit in half and scrape the orange seeded pulp into the pan.
Cook the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the
sugar is dissolved. Add the softened gelatin mixture and cook the
mixture for 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the gelatin is
dissolved. Remove the mixture from the heat and cool for 10 minutes.

3.Pour the cooled passion fruit topping over the top of the chilled
cake, tilting the cake to cover the top evenly. Refrigerate the cake
for 1 hour, until the topping is set.

4.Remove the side of the springform pan and transfer the cake to a
serving platter. Cut the cake with a sharp, thin-bladed knife,
dipping the blade in hot water and wiping it dry after each slice.

cutter. Place on the baking sheet with sufficient space to allow them
to spread. Bake for 20 minutes until light golden in colour.

Cake Diamonds Soaked With Syrup (Tishpishti P

cakes, passover, jewish, sephardic

      ----DOUGH----
1 cup matzo meal
1 cup matzo cake meal
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup blanched almonds or walnuts; finely ground
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground cloves
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 large egg
3/4 cup ; cold water
16  whole almonds blanched or
1  almonds unblanched
      ----SYRUP----
2/3 cup sugar
2/3 cup ; cold water
2 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon lemon juice; preferably fresh

For the dough, combine the matzo meal, cake meal, 1/2 cup sugar,
ground almonds, cinnamon, and cloves in a medium-sized bowl. Add the
oil, egg, and 3/4 cup water, and mix very well for form a stiff
dough. Knead the dough with your hands a few times to complete the
mixing. Evenly press the dough into a greased 8-inch-square baking
pan. Use a knife to cut the dough into diamonds.  First, cut the
dough crosswise into about 4 even rows. Then make diagonal, parallel
cuts through the rows. (If desired, cut the dough into squares,
instead.)  Press a whole almond into the center of each piece. Bake
the cake in a preheated 375-degree oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or
until it is browned and firm.

Meanwhile, prepare the syrup.  Put the sugar and water into a small
saucepan.  Stir over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves and
the syrup comes to a boil; then boil the syrup, uncovered and
undisturbed, for 8 minutes.  Stir in the honey and lemon juice.
Remove the syrup from the heat, and set it aside to cool slightly.

When the cake has finished baking, remove it from the oven, and recut
the pieces.  Pour the syrup evenly over the hot cake. Let the cake
rest for several hours to completely absorb the syrup. After the
syrup has been absorbed, cover the cake with aluminum foil or plastic
wrap and store it at room temperature. Makes about 16 pieces. Source:
The Jewish Holiday Cookbook by Gloria Kaufer Greene.

Note:  This is a passover version of a cake popular with Turkish and
Greek Jews throughout the year.  The cake is soaked in a sugar-honey
syrup after it is baked. For best flavor and texture, tishpishti
should be made at least one day ahead.  It will stay well for several
days.

1  peel of 1 lemon
3  eggs
250 gm flour (2 cups plus 3 1/2 tbsp)
6 gm baking powder (1 3/4 tsp)

Also for 'versoffenen Apfelkuchen' (drunk apple tart). Cut in half
horizontally.  Spread vanilla pudding on top, then scatter
strawberries or raspberries, (?*) on top of that, then whipped cream.
Top with more strawberries.

((*Note:  I absolutely cannot make any sense of that word. It looks
like 'Narinken' or 'Merinken' - neither of which means anything to
me. At a guess, some other sort of berries, or possibly morellos.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 9-inch square

inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, and the cake is
shrinking from the sides of the pan, 40 to 50 minutes. Let stand on a
wire cake rack for 5 minutes. Place the confectioners' sugar in a
sieve and dust over the top of the cake. Serve the cake warm or
completely cooled.  Makes 12 to 16 servings. Source: "An Edible

1 cup sugar, granulated
1  almond extract; or rosewater
1  fresh violets or
1  fresh rose petals

These are decorations for desserts. Do NOT use African violets! Make a
syrup by stirring water into sugar in small saucepan. Boil till
slightly thickened; stir in almond extract to taste. Let syrup cool a
little.
Place the violets, a few at a time into syrup. Make sure that they
are completely covered. Remove from syrup and place on wax paper to
dry. If syrup gets hard, reheat, adding a little more water. MAKES: 1
cup syrup An alternative method of making candied violets is to coat
petals with lightly beaten egg white and sprinkle with fruit sugar.

Canned Apple Cake

cakes, fruits, deserts

2/3 cup shortening
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3 1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoon baking soda
4  eggs
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup applesauce
1 teaspoon cinnamon (ground)
3 1/3 cup flour
1 teaspoon cloves (ground)
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup pecans (chopped)

Grease 8 WIDE-MOUTH pint canning jars with melted shortening. Use a
brush and avoid getting grease on the jar rims. Cream shortening and
sugar. Beat in eggs and applesauce. Sift together the dry ingredients
and blend them into the applesauce mixture.  Add the raisins and nuts
and divide the batter evenly between 8 widemouth pint jars. The jars
will be more than half full.  Bake open jars about 60 minutes in an
oven at 325 degrees. When done, quickly remove one hot jar at a time
and clean its sealing edge. Immediately apply and firmly tighten a
two-piece wide-mouth canning lid. The lid will form a vacuum seal as
the jar cools. Jars of cooled bread may be stored on the pantry shelf
with other canned foods or may be placed in a freezer.  The bread is
safe to eat as long as jars remain vacuum sealed and free of mold
growth.

NOTE: The lady who contributed this recipe to the magazine noted that
she had some of this cake that is one year old and is still
delicious. I have personally made this and have several jars that are
still good over 5 months later.  I plan to save one jar from my
original batch and see how long it will keep. (Nancy)

Canned Cake Hints

cakes, deserts

1 single ellie collin cmkd93f

I have a few more recipes but no time to upload them right now, I'll
do that later on this evening. BTW, ANY cake can be baked in canning
jars. I usually try one jar first--you have to know how much volume
each recipe will give you. I usually fill ONE jar 1/2 full then bake
it to see how high it rises. You don't want the cake to come out of
the top of the jar, only to within 1/4 to 1/2 inch from the lip of
the jar. Once you've established how high the cake rises, you can go
from there. The first time around is a bit tricky because you won't
know how many jars you'll need. MOST of the recipes I've tried I end
up using around 8. Sterilize as many jars as you think you'll need
and go from there. Also, the baking times will vary--the moistness of
each cake recipe will determine the time. Again, MOST of the recipes
I've tried bake in 35-40 minutes. Start checking the cakes at 30
minutes and go from there. YES, the cakes DO slide easily out of the
jars IF you use the jars I listed. They're Ball Quilted Crystal
Canning Jars (#14400-81400). They can be found at most grocery stores
(at least here in California) next to the pectin and other canning
supplies. Also, I've seen the 12 oz straight-sided (plain) jars (# ?)
at Smart & Final. The plain jars work fine too but they're not as
pretty and you have to make your own labels--the jars I use come with
decorative labels. One IMPORTANT tip--get your jars NOW! Once
summer's over with they're very hard to find. Also, when you can, ask
for the jars back, they're NOT cheap. Most folks don't mind returning
them though, they usually want refills! <G> Make sure your LIDS are
new, the rings don't have to be As the jars do seal, the cakes are as
moist as the day you put them into the jars--sometimes MORESO. There
will be a little condensation on the lids and some in the jars so
when you seal them it's trapped inside. Don't worry about getting the
water off of the lids before placing them onto the jars, the added
moisture doesn't hurt the cakes in the slightest. I'm trying to
address every question that's been asked of me before, I HOPE I've
done that. If I've missed anything or if anyone has any questions,
don't hesitate to ask. These make WONDERFUL Christmas gifts and you
can start NOW! Single friends really appreciate these because each
jar makes enough for one or two people.

Caramel Nut Frosting

cakes

3 cup sugar
2 tablespoon light cane syrup (or corn syrup
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 lb butter (1 stick)
1 1/2 cup chopped pecans

Place 1-1/2 cups of the sugar into a heavy saucepan, taking care that
no crystals cling to the sides of the pan. Add syrup. Add cream by
pouring down the sides of the pan to wash away any crystals that may
have collected there. Place sauce pan over medium heat and stir as
sugar melts. When mixture boils, place remaining sugar in a heavy
saute pan (preferably cast iron) over medium heat and stir until
sugar melts and turns golden brown. DO NOT LET SUGAR BURN OR IT WILL
TASTE BITTER. Add browned sugar to the mixture in the saucepan. Stir
and cook until mixture reaches the soft ball stage (240 deg).  Add
vanilla and pour mixture over chunked butter in a mixing bowl. Let
cool for about 5 minutes, then beat vigourously until frosting
reaches spreading consistency. Add chopped pecans. Frost top of each
layer, stacking one upon the other, then frost side of cake. Freezes
well [but *I'll* never know]. ** The secret of success with this
frosting is in the sugar. After the ingredients have reached the
proper temperature, no sugar crystals can be introduced into the
liquid, else the frosting will be grainy instead of smooth and creamy.

1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
4 tablespoon + 2 t unsalted butter
2 cup + 1 t all purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

EQUIPMENT: 2 1/2-qt saucepan, whisk, stainless steel bowl, 9 x 3-inch
springform pan, electric mixer with paddle, rubber spatula, red
toothpick, 10-inch plate, serrated slicer, large 100%-cotton kitchen
towel, cake spatula Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. To prepare the
caramel flavoring, combine the granulated sugar and lemon juice in a
2 1/2-qt saucepan and stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will
resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar for 5 to 6 minutes over
medium-high heat, stirring constantly to break up any lumps (the
sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then brown as it
caramelizes). Remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully add the
heavy cream; stir to combine (the mixture will steam and boil rapidly
as the cream is added). Transfer the caramel to a stainless steel
bowl and allow to cool to room temperature. Continued >>>

Carrot Cake (Aargau)

cakes, swiss

5  eggs; separated
275 gm sugar
1  lemon; juice
2  lemons; zest, grated
250 gm almonds; ground
300 gm carrots; finely grated
75 gm cornflour
1 pinch cinnamon; ground
1 pinch cloves; ground
10 gm baking powder
1/2 deciliter kirsch
1 pinch salt  for glazing
50 gm apricot jelly
1  fondant icing
1  marzipan carrots

(Units: 100 g = 3 1/2 oz; 1 dl = 3 1/2 fl oz = 2/5 cup; 180 oC = 350
oF; 200 oC = 400 oF; 230 oC = 450 oF; 250 oC = 475 oF; 2.5 cm = 1
inch)

The Story:

The cultivation of vegetables in Aargau is one of the main reasons
for the existence of a thriving canning/bottling industry. In this
area, the carrot is the Queen of all vegetables and it has attributes
which allow it to be used everywhere, even in desserts.

This carrot cake is now a Swiss classic, its reputation having been
extended long ago far beyond the borders of the canton. Some maintain
that the cake is better two days after baking as the carrots keep it
moist.

The Recipe:

Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest, until
light.

Add the finely grated carrots and the almonds.

Mix in the cornflour, cinnamon, ground cloves and baking powder. Then
add the kirsch.

Mix or beat until smooth.

Beat the egg whites until stiff and carefully fold in.

Butter a tin (24 cm diameter, 5 cm high), dust with flour. Turn the
mixture into the tin.

Bake in the oven for 50 ... 60 minutes at 180 oC.

When cooked, brush the cake with a hot apricot glaze and thin fondant
icing. Decorate with small marzipan carrots.

Carrot Cake With An Indian Flavor

cakes, deserts, indian

1 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 cup unbleached white flour - plus extra; for dusting
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom seeds
1 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup softened clarified butter - (ghee)
1 1/2 cup grated carrots - firmly packed
2 tablespoon chopped pistachios
2 tablespoon chopped blanched almonds
2 tablespoon raisins
1  edible silver foil (opt.)

"A characteristic sweet of southern India is carrot halvah, a rich,
sweet reduction of carrots and spices that is almost fudgelike in
consistency. This cake falls somewhere between this traditional treat
and the popular American carrot cake.  It has a dense texture and the
unexpected flavor of cardamom, yet doesn't require the tedious
cooking and stirring of a halvah.

"Special Indian dishes are often decorated with silver foil -- a
microscopic thin sheet of edible, flavorless real silver, available in
Indian groceries.  We have cut edible foil into decorative shapes -- a
tedious business that must be done in a completely draftless room --
but more manageable solid toppings are customary.

"Serve this nontraditional ending to your Indian meal with coffee
that has been brewed with a few cardamom seeds."

Rub a round cake pan that is 9 inches in diameter and 1-1/2 inches in
height with the vegetable oil and then dust it very lightly with
flour. Preheat the oven to
350    F.

Sift 1 cup flour with the baking soda and salt.

Beat the eggs well in a large bowl.  Add the cardamom, sugar, and
clarified butter.  Keep beating until all the ingredients are
thoroughly mixed.

Add the sifted flour mixture to the ingredients in the large bowl and
fold it in gently with a spatula.  Add the carrots, pistachios,
almonds, and raisins.  Fold them in gently as well.

Turn the cake batter into the oiled and floured cake pan and bake for
35 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes
out clean and the top is golden red.  Decorate top with edible silver
foil.

3/4 cup chopped toasted walnuts
      ----FROSTING----
4  8-oz packages cream cheese,

frosting over.  Top with second cake. Spoon 2 cups frosting into
pastry bag fitted with large star tip. Spread remaining frosting
smoothly over top and sides of cake.

Pipe frosting in 4 parallel lines atop cake in opposite direction,
forming lattice.  Press 1 cup nuts onto sides of cake. Pipe ring of
frosting around top edge of cake. Stir 1/4 cup marmalade to loosen;
spoon some into 1 row of lattice diamonds.  Spoon some remaining nuts
into next row of diamonds. Repeat, alternating marmalade and nuts,
filling rows completely. (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover with cake
dome and chill.)

Christmas Cake (British)

cakes, deserts

2 lb mixed dried fruit
4 oz glace' cherries
4 oz candied fruit
3 oz blanched almonds
10 oz plain flour
1 single pinch salt
1/4 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
1 teaspoon mixed spice
4 single eggs
1/2 teaspoon flavoring (vanilla, lemon)
1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses
8 oz butter
8 oz soft brown sugar
1 single whisky to soak fruit
250 ml milk (to mix)

(Note: (1) The mixed dried fruit should be such things as seedless
raisins and currants. (2) The 1/2 teaspoon of "flavoring" can be
almond, or lemon, or vanilla, or a mixture of the three. (3) "Mixed
spice" is a combination of cinnamon, allspice and mace: about 1/3 of
each.) -- Find a 9-inch cake pan at least three inches deep; grease
it, and line the bottom and sides with a double thickness of greased
baking parchment. Tie folded brown paper or newspaper around the
outside of the pan. (The paper is insulation, to keep the sides of
the cake from scorching as it bakes.) Set oven to 320-300F: have
folded paper to stand the pan on when baking -- place low in oven.
Pick over the dried fruit, removing any stems, etc. Wash, drain well
and spread over a cloth on a tray to dry. When dry, put in a bowl and
pour a small wine-glass of spirit over it. Cover well and leave
overnight. -- Next day, add chopped peel, blanched chopped almonds,
and cherries minced and drained. Mix thoroughly. Sift together the
flour, salt, soda and spice. Beat the eggs well with the molasses and
flavoring. Put the butter into a large warmed bowl and beat until
soft; then add the sugar and beat until light and creamy. Beat in the
egg mixture, about a sixth of it at a time, then fold in half the
flour mixture. Add remainder of the flour to the fruit and mix well.
Add fruit to creamed mixture and fold in well. Put into pan and bake
for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours or until done. If top of cake is browning
too fast, cover with a few thicknesses of paper. Reduce the oven heat
slightly every hour -- about 10 degrees. Test with skewer for
doneness. Keep the paper wrapped around the cake in place until
completely cooled, so that the cooling takes place slowly. After
completely cooled, invert the cake, lift the baking parchment off the
bottom, and sprinkle the cake generously with the spirit of your
choice. Wrap well in foil, put in a sealed tin, and keep in a cool
place (not necessarily refrigerated) . The cake benefits from
occasional unwrappings and sprinkling with more spirit. It takes
about 2 months to achieve maximum "mellowness".

Christmas Stollen (Quick-Bread Variety)

breads, cakes, holiday

2 1/2 cup flour (all-purpose)
2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon mace
8 single cardomon seed pods, seeds
1  removed and crushed
3/4 cup almonds, blanched, ground
1/2 cup butter, soft
1 cup cream cheese, softened
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 tablespoon brandy
1/2 cup currants
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/3 cup candied lemon peel, chopped
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup sugar, powdered

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together the flour, baking powder,
sugar, salt, mace, and crushed cardamon seeds. Stir in the ground
almonds. Cut in the soft butter until the mixture looks something
like coarse sand. In a blender, cream the egg with the cream cheese,
vanilla, almond extract, and brandy. Pour it into a bowl and stir in
the dried fruit. Gradually stir in the flour mixture until everything
is is well blended. Work the dough into a ball and turn it out on a
lightly floured board. Knead it for a few minutes until it is smooth,
then place it in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.  (You can
store the dough in the refrigerator for several days, then take it
out to bake when ever you like.) Shape the dough into a flat, oval
loaf, about 10 inches long and eight inches wide. With the blunt edge
of a knife, crease the loaf about 1/2 inch off center, down the
length of it.  Fold the smaller side of the creased loaf over the
wider side. Brush the top of the folded loaf with the melted butter.
Place the stollen loaf on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for
about 45 minutes, until it starts to turn brown on the outside.
Remove and allow to cool a little bit. Dust lightly with powdered
(i.e., confectioner's) sugar.

Cocoa Chiffon Cream Cake - Country Living Hol

cakes, deserts, holiday

      ----CAKE----
8 large eggs
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 2/3 cup unsifted cake flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon cream oftartar
      ----FILLING----
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa
1/4 cup seedless raspberry preserves
1  frosting (opt, recipe below)

1. Separate eggs one hour before preparing cake, if possible. Allow
whites to sit, covered, at room temperature for 1 hour. Put 4 yolks
in a cup; cover tightly and refrigerate until ready to continue
recipe. Refrigerate remaining yolks, covered, for use at another time.

2. When whites have come to room temperature, heat oven to 325'F. In a
medium bowl, gradually beat water into whites until smooth. Add 4
yolks and salad oil; beat until well combined.

3. Add cake flour, cocoa, 1 C sugar, baking soda, and salt. Beat just
until smooth; stir in vanilla.

4. Add cream of tartar to egg whites. Beat until fluffy. Continue
beating, gradually adding remaining 1/2 C sugar, until stiff peaks
form when the beater is raised.

5. Pour flour mixture over egg whites. Gently fold together just until
completely combined. Turn into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake
until cake springs back when gently touched-about 55 to 60 minutes.

6. Remove cake from oven and immediately invert pan. Let cool corn-
pletely, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, before removing from pan. In a large bowl,
combine cream, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and cocoa for filling.
Refrigerate.

7. To assemble, carefully loosen cake from pan; remove pan and invert
cake on serving plate. Cut a 1 inch slice, crosswise, from top of
cake. Remove and set aside.

8. Hollow out center of cake leaving 1-inch thick walls on all sides.
Beat cream mixture just until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to
overbeat.

9. Break half of the cake removed from the center into 1/2-inch
chunks. You need about 5 cups. Fold into cream. Spoon into hollow of
cake. Remaining cake scraps are good for snacking.

10. Invert reserved ring of cake so that the top is down; spread
exposed side with raspberry preserves. Place on cake with preserves
down. Cover tightly and refrigerate several hours or overnight. If
desired, frost before serving.

Frosting: In a medium bowl, beat together 1 1-lb box
confectioners'sugar, 1/4 C softened butter or margarine, 3 T
unsweetened cocoa, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 3 to 4 T milk until
smooth. Use to frost cake.

2 cup cake flour; sifted
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup butter; or shortening
1 cup sugar
3  eggs; unbeaten
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla

Sift flour once, measure,add baking powder and salt, and sift together
three times.  Cream  butter thoroughly, add sugar gradually, and cream
together until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating
thoroughly after each.  Add  flour, alternately with milk, a small
amount at a time, beating after each addition until smooth. Add
vanilla. Bake in two greased 9-inch layer pans in moderate oven at
375degrees F.) 25 to 30 minutes. Spread Tinted Seven Minute Frosting

of cake with Baker's Southern Style Coconut. Use the recipe for
Coconut Layer Cake. Spread Fudge Frosting between layers and on top
and sides of cake. Decorate sides of cake with chopped pecans, if
desired.  Note: This recipe was taken from an old phamplet dated
1940, which featured Kate Smith's favorite Cakes. It was published by
General Mills, and the pampHlet is falling apart! I am glad to be
able to save these old recipes. For those who too young to remember,
where
it calls for the use of a rotary mixer in these recipes, just use
your electric mixer, or hand mixer as required.

Cornish Saffron Cake

cakes, deserts

3 pkg saffron strands (0.05 g)
1 tablespoon boiling water
1/3 cup sugar
1 cup warm water (110'f./44'c.)
1 pkg active dry yeast (1/4 oz)
5 cup bread flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup lard
1/2 cup butter
1 2/3 cup currants or mixed fruit

Lightly grease 2 9x5" loaf pans. Line a broiler pan with foil. Place
saffron on foil and spread thinly. Place pan under a very low broiler
and gently dry saffron (do not discolor) 3-4 minutes or until dry.

Place saffron in a small bowl and crush to a fine powder. Add boiling
water and let stand 8 hours. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of sugar in 1/4 cup
warm water. Add yeast, whisk and let stand 10-15 minutes or until
frothy. Put flour, salt, lard and butter into a bowl and cut in
finely. Mix in remaining sugar and currants. Stir saffron into
remaining warm water and add to flour mixture. Stir in yeast and mix
to form a dough. Knead lightly, cover and let rise in a warm place
until double in bulk.

Knead dough and divide in half. Press each piece to a rectangle with
width equal to length of loaf pan. Roll up dough, jellyroll style,
and place in greased loaf pans, seam side down. Press to fill
corners. Cover and let stand at room temperature until dough has
risen to top of pans. Preheat oven to 375'F. (190'C.). Bake in
preheated oven 35-45 minutes or until golden. If necessary, cover
with foil during baking to prevent overbrowning. Cool on a wire rack.
Let stand 1 day before serving.

Craig's Macadamia Cake

cakes, deserts

      ----FOR THE CAKE----
1 1/4 cup macadamia nuts
1/4 cup cake flour
6  egg yolks
3/4 cup sugar
3 drop vanilla
1 teaspoon kirsch
7  egg whites
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
      ----FOR THE FILLING----
2 cup macadamia nuts
1/2 cup sugar water
2 tablespoon corn syrup
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon whipping cream
      ----FOR THE ICING----
2 cup flaked unsweetened coconut
1 cup whipping cream
2 tablespoon sugar; to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

For the CAKE: Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan. Toast the
nuts in a preheated 325 F oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they
smell nutty. Cool. Grate the nuts fine with a hand nut grater and
stir in the flour, or grind them fine with the flour in a food
processor. Beat the egg yolks with half the sugar, the vanilla, and
the kirsch to a 3-second ribbon. Warm the egg whites over hot water
or swirl them over a gas flame until barely warm, then beat them with
the salt and the cream of tartar to soft peaks again. Spread the yolk
mixture over the whites and sprinkle with a quarter of the nuts.
Fold until partially mixed, sprinkle with another quarter of the
nuts, and fold. Repeat until all the nuts have been folded in. Be
careful not to overwork the batter and deflate the eggs. Pour into
the prepared pan and bake in a preheated 325 F oven for 30 to 40
minutes, or until the sides of the cake just begin to pull away from
the sides of the pan. Cool. For the FILLING: Toast the nuts in a
preheated 325 F oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they smell nutty.
Cool and chop coarse. Shake the nuts in a coarse strainer to remove
any dusty particles. Put the sugar in a small non-corroding saucepan,
add the water, and cook over medium heat until light gold.  Remove
from the heat and carefully add the corn syrup, butter, and cream.
Stir over low heat until the caramel has dissolved, then stir the
caramel into the nuts to bind them. Slice the cake into two layers
and spread the warm filling between them. For the ICING: Toast the
coconut in a preheated 325 F oven for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring often
until pale golden brown.  Cool.  Whip the cream with the sugar and
vanilla until it holds soft peaks and is just stiff enough to spread
on the cake. Ice the cake with the cream and press the coconut all
over the surface of the cake.

3 1/2 cup unsifted all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1 cup confectioners' sugar
1  candied orange peel and cranberries; (recipe follows, opt.)
1  fresh mint sprigs and gold ribbon (; opt.)

1. Using a grater, finely grate the rind from 1 orange and set aside.
If making Candied Orange Peel, with vegetable peeler, remove orange
part of peel in strips from the remaining 2 oranges. Whether peeled
or not, cut all oranges in half and ream in juicer or squeeze to get

tube pan. In small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda,
and salt.

Remove from pan; cool completely on rack.

6. Meanwhile, in small bowl, with electric mixer or spoon, beat

consistency. Prepare Candied Orange Peel and Cranberries, if desired.

7. Transfer cake to serving plate. Spoon icing over top of cake,
allowing it to slowly drip down the side. If desired, top with
candied peel and 5 cranberries; decorate with mint sprigs tied with
gold rib- bon and remaining 2 cranberries.

Candied Orange Peel and Cranberries: Cut reserved orange-peel strips
into 1/8-inch-wide strips. Drop strips into s@all saucepan of boiling
water and blanch 1 minute. Drain strips in strainer. Repeat with
fresh boiling water to blanch orange strips again. Drain and return
strips, plus 7 fresh or frozen cranberries, to sauce-pan. With fork,
stir in 1 T sugar and heat until sugar dissolves and coats peel and
cranberries. Cool to room temperature.

Creamy Coconut Cake

cakes

      ----FOR THE CAKE----
2 1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup milk
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup butter, softened
4  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
      ----FOR THE FILLING----
8 oz whipped cream, stiff
1/4 cup confectioners sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup coconut
1 teaspoon vanilla
      ----FOR THE FROSTING----
2 pkg 3 oz ea cream cheese, soft
2 tablespoon butter, softened
2 teaspoon vanilla
4 cup confectioners sugar
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 pkg 8 oz coconut

1. Preheat oven to 350F. Grease (and flour if you wish) 3 nine (9")
inch round pans. Mix flour with baking powder and 1/2 ts salt. In a
large bowl, mixed at high speed beat the butter and 2 cups of sugar
until light. Add 4 eggs, one at a time, and beat after each time you
add one. 2. Continue beating, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber
scraper, until fluffy - about 2 minutes. At low speed, beat in flour
mixture, in fourths alternating with milk (in thirds) beginning and
ending with the flour mix. Add vanilla. Beat until just smooth, about
1 min. 3. Pour into prepared pans, and bake for 25-30 min., or until
sur- face springs back when lightly touched. Cool pans on wire racks
10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool thoroughly. 4. Prepare the
filling: simply whip the cream, adding the sugar and vanilla, and
keep cool until the cake has cooled completely. 5. Make the frosting:
cream the cream cheese and sugar together, (both should be soft),
then add the sugar and vanilla. You might need to add a little milk
to make it to the consistency you like. 6. When everything is cool
and ready, place a layer on the plate you will serve it from, top
side down. Fill with whipped cream filling, and sprinkle with coconut
and if you would like add chopped walnuts. Repeat with the second
layer, and then place the top layer on. Frost the sides and the top.
Cover the entire cake with coconut and if you wish, add chopped
walnuts.Refrigerate to set the frosting. NOTE: I had to use skewers
to hold the cake in place while I was frosting it, and it might be a
good idea to use these to prevent the cake from sliding.

Creole Christmas Cake

cakes, holiday

3 tablespoon rum
3 tablespoon brandy
3 tablespoon cherry brandy
3 tablespoon cointreau
3 tablespoon water
1 1/2 teaspoon angostura bitters
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon molasses sugar
225 gm sultanas
225 gm raisins
225 gm currants
100 gm stoned no-soak prunes; chopped
50 gm glace cherries; chopped
100 gm mixed candied peel
50 gm almonds; chopped
50 gm pecans; chopped
250 gm self-raising flour
250 gm demerara sugar
250 gm butter; room temperature
5 each eggs (size 1)

This very rich cake from the West Indies is ideal for those who
prefer not to ice their Christmas cakes. Indeed, icing is not
recommended. Just tie a brightly coloured ribbon round it and you
have a real feast of cake. The fruit and nuts are soaked for a week
before baking.

Directions: Six to eight days before you intend to bake the cake,
measure out the rum, brandy, cherry brandy, cointreau, water and
bitters into a large saucepan. Then add the spices, sugar, fruit and
nuts. Stir the ingredients together and heat them over a very low
heat until the liquid is just moving - DO NOT LET IT BOIL. Simmer for
about 15 minutes. Tip the mixture into a mixing bowl or other glass
or china container and allow it to cool completely. Cover the bowl
with a double layer of clingfilm and place in the refrigerator or a
very cool place. Stir the mixture from time to time during the next
few days.

Six to eight days later, preheat the oven to Gas 1, 275 F., 140 C.
Cream the butter and sugar together and fold in the flour and beaten
eggs. Add the fruit mixture a little at a time until it is evenly
blended. Spoon the cake mixture into the prepared tin, level the top
and bake in the preheated oven for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. If you
think the cake is becoming too brown, place a double thickness of
greaseproof paper over the top of it as protection. When the cake is
quite cold, wrap it in greaseproof paper first then either place it
well in a plastic cake box or wrap it in silver foil.

This cake will keep for a few weeks. Taken from Christmas baking
magazine.

Souce: Woman's Weekly (no idea about date). Entered by Anja Wolle June
1996.

Comments(Anja): this is a lovely cake, but the sugar for the topping
is too much, and I think it might turn out better if you used caster
(superfine) sugar. I also used about twice as much lemon juice (4
tb), to achieve a good coverage.

Currant Cakes (Old-Fashioned Christmas Drop C

1 lb sugar
1 lb butter

3/4 lb flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 lb currants
1 each lemon, juice of
1 each lemon, rind of

Mix the currants with some of the flour. Work butter and sugar
together to a smooth cream, then slowly work in whole eggs one at a
time. Add a little of the flour, rind and juice of the lemon and
salt. Work in slowly the rest of the flour and the currants. Drop by
spoonfuls on large buttered pans, pressing flat with a knife as the
cakes are better when very thin. A good plan is to heat the pan a bit
and allow the cakes to melt as much as possible before putting them
in the oven to bake. Be sure to butter the pans thoroughly;
otherwise, the thin cakes will be difficult to remove. (recipe didn't
include baking time or temp). Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book -

Dark Christmas Cake

cakes, christmas

1 lb blanched almonds
3 lb seedless raisins
2 lb currants
1 lb candied cherries,
1  cut in half
1 lb dried figs, chopped
1 lb dates, cut up
1 1/2 lb chopped mixed candied peels
1 lb candied pineapple, cut up
1 cup all-purpose flour
3 cup soft butter
3 cup brown sugar, packed
12 large egg yolks
5 1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon cinnamon
2 teaspoon mace
2 teaspoon allspice
2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon cloves
3 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup prune juice
1/4 cup brandy
12 large egg whites

This recipe makes a very large amount (about 28 cups) of fruit cake
batter and can be baked in a number of different sizes of pan. If you
want to make several small cakes for gifts you can divide the batter
among 9 8x4x3 inch loaf pans using a generous 3 cups of batter for
each. Or if you wish to use larger loaf pans you can put the batter
in 6 9x5x3 inch pans using a generous 4 1/2 cups batter in each.
Bundt pans make attractive cakes and this amount of batter is enough
for 3 12 cup Bundt pans using a generous 9 cups of batter in each. If
you use 10-inch tube pans you can make 2 cakes using 12 cups of
batter for each and an 8x4x2 1/2 inch loaf pan with the remaining
batter. Of course you can also use any combination of these sizes.
For example, you can make a large cake in a Bundt pan, two 9x5x3-in
loaves and three 8x4x3-inch loaves. If you wish you can prepare half
the batter and bake it in three 9x5x3-inch loaf pans or in one 12-cup
Bundt pan and one 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Line greased pans with greased
heavy brown paper, except for the Bundt pan which should be greased
and floured. COMBINE nuts and fruit in a very large bowl or roasting
pan. Add 1 cup of flour and toss by hand to coat fruit with flour.
CREAM butter well ( you can use your electric mixer for this part of
the recipe). Add sugar and beat until fluffy. Beat in egg yolks.
Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Sift 5 1/2 cups flour with salt,
spices and soda and add to creamed mixture alternately with prune
juice and brandy. Mix with a wooden spoon. Add this mixture to the
fruit and nuts and blend well.The easiest way to blend this large
amount of mixture is with your hands. Beat egg whites until stiff and
fold into mixture. MEASURE into prapared pans and press well into the
corners. Heat oven to 275'F. Bake cakes in 8x4x3-inch pans for about
3 hours, in 9x5x3-inch pans or Bundt pans for about 3 hours and 15
minutes and in 10-inch tube pans about 3 1/2 hours or until a
toothpick stuck in the center comes out clean. Let stand in pans a
few minutes, then turn out on racks and cool. Strip off paper and
wrap cakes in cheesecloth dampened with brandy and then in foil and
store in a cool place. MAKES 15 LBS OF FRUIT CAKE.

Dark Fruitcake

cakes

16 oz citron, candied (or candied fruit a; nd peels)
8 oz cherries, candied
1 cup raisins, dark
1 cup raisins, golden
1 1/3 cup calmyra figs, cut into pieces
1 1/3 cup dates (pitted), cut into small slic; es
1 1/2 cup pecan halves (or walnut halves if n; ecessary)
1/2 cup brandy
3 cup flour (white)
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon cinnamon, ground
1 teaspoon nutmeg, ground
1 teaspoon allspice, ground
1 teaspoon cloves, ground
4  eggs
1 3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
1 cup orange juice
3/4 cup butter, melted (cooled)
1/4 cup molasses, light (treacle)

Mix fruits together in a bowl.  Pour brandy over fruits.  Turn fruit
mixture over every 20 minutes. Soaking time is a matter of taste, but two
hours is typical. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Prepare tube pan: grease
sides and bottom. Line bottom and sides with greased brown paper.

In a very large bowl, mix flour, spices, baking powder and salt.  Stir
until spices are evenly blended throughout.

In a third bowl beat eggs until fluffy.  Add brown sugar, orange juice,
molasses and butter.  Mix, making sure that all the sugar dissolves.

Pour off any liquid from fruit mixture and add the fruit and the nuts to
the dry ingredients. Mix until all fruit pieces are coated. Then pour in
the liquids and mix gently until you have an evenly-mixed batter.

Pour batter into pan and bake at 300 degrees F. for 1 hour.  Cover pan with
foil and bake for 1 hour more or until toothpick inserted in center comes
out clean. Cool for 30 minutes before removing from pan. Peel off paper
very carefully.

Put cake in cake tin lined with foil.  For the next 3 to 4 weeks, sprinkle
a little brandy over cake twice a week. Keep cake covered and store the tin
in the refrigerator. If you prefer to omit the brandy, cover top of cake
with very thin slices of apple instead.

NOTES:

*  An extravagant, traditional fruitcake -- This is about as rich a
fruitcake as you could possibly want to make. It started life as a Better
Homes and Gardens recipe, but has been changed beyond all recognition.
Yield:  a 7 lb cake.

*  This makes a HUGE cake.  If your tube pan isn't at least 10 X 4 inches,
there is a fair chance that it will run over; in that case, use several
loaf pans instead (fill loaf pans about half-way). A pan with a removable
center will make extracting the cake much easier.

*  Except for mixing the liquids, an electric beater is useless for this
recipe.

*  In the USA, candied fruits typically come in packages of the indicated
sizes.  If you have to measure by volume, use 2 1/2 cups of candied citron
and 1 1/3 cups of the candied cherries. I prefer citron instead of the
mixture because there's no bitterness from the rinds, although the cake
isn't so colorful. Calmyra figs are the light-colored figs most commonly
seen in North America.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  2 hours preparation (including soaking the fruit), 2 hours baking,
several weeks mellowing.
: Precision:  Measure batter ingredients carefully.  Fruit and nut
quantities are somewhat flexible.

Denice Dade's Killer Carrot Cake

cakes, deserts

2 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cup vegetable oil *
2 cup sugar
4  eggs, slighlty beaten
2 cup raw, grated carrots
1 cup diced peaches or pineapple
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)
      ----FROSTING----
8 oz cream cheese, softened
1 lb box confectioner's sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
12 tablespoon butter/margarine

1.  Cake:  Sift together dry ingredients.  Add the rest of the cake
ingredients and mix well.  Pour into greased bundt or 9x13 pan and
bake at 325 degrees F for 30 mintues to 1 hour (depends on how much
liquid is in your fruit), or until cake springs back from finger when
lightly pressed on top.  Cool completely prior to frosting.

2.  Frosting:  Cream together all frosting ingredients and spread over
cooled cake.

*  To lower the fat in the recipe, I often replace 1/2 to 3/4 cup of
the oil with the juice left over from the peaches or pineapple (I use
canned). It turns out fine. I have also used lowfat cream cheese in
the frosting with success...it's just slightly less firm.

Devil's Food With Fudge Frosting

cakes, deserts

      ----CAKE----
1 3/4 cup sifted cake flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder (not a mix)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 large eggs
1 cup boiling water
      ----FROSTING----
1/4 cup unsalted butter
2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 oz unsweetened chocolate  melted
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon half-and-half or milk or  evaporate; d milk

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Grease 2 8-inch layer cake pans well, then
dust them generously with cocoa. (This gives the cake layers a rich
brown finish). Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt onto a
piece of waxed paper and set it aside. Cream the butter until it is
fluffy, add the sugar and vanilla, and continue beating until the
batter is silvery and light. Beat the eggs in one by one, then add
the sifted dry ingredients, alternately with the boiling water,
beginning and ending with the dry ingredients and beating well after
each addition. Divide the batter equally between the two pans,
smoothing the tops. Bake the layers uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes,
or until the layers feel spongy to the touch and begin to pull away
from the sides of the pans. Cool the layers upright in their pans on
wire racks for 10 minutes, then carefully loosen them around the
edges with a spatula and turn them onto wire racks. Cool them
completely. FOR THE FROSTING: Cream the butter until it is light,
then add the confectioners' sugar gradually, beating all the while.
Beat in the melted chocolate and vanilla, then add just enough cream
to make the frosting a good consistency for spreading. Sandwich the
two cake layers together with frosting, then frost the top and sides
of the cake. Swirl the frosting into peaks and valleys.

Dirt Cake

cakes, deserts

1  flower pot
1  garden trowel
3  gummy worms (or plastic)
1  plastic flowers, bunch
16 oz oreo cookies
1/2 cup butter, softened
8 oz cream cheese, softened
1 cup confectioner's sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 pkg inst choc-fudge pudding(4oz)
3 cup milk
12 oz whipped topping,1 tub thawed

This is a joke, a bit of whimsy to lighten up your next party. The
cake is really a quick mix dessert made with Oreo cookies and soft
squishy stuff. The trick is to capture everyone's attention with an
announcement of some sort, and as you are speaking, trowel out some
of the dirt from the flower pot around the flowers and eat it. May be
followed by a worm dug out of the "dirt". You may substitute vanilla
pudding for the chocolate if you want, and use up to 20 oz of Oreos.
Please use a clean new plastic flower pot or take the precaution of
lining a clay pot with foil and wrap the stems of live flowers if you
use them in order to prevent any toxins from entering the dessert.
Crush the cookies until they resemble potting soil.
Set aside.   Cream the butter or margarine, cream cheese, sugar and
vanilla until smooth and fluffy.
Set aside.  Combine the pudding mix and milk until well blended.
Then fold in the whipped topping.
Gently fold the cream cheese and pudding mixtures together. To put
the "cake" together, layer one-third of the cookie crumbs followed by
1/2 of the pudding mixture, 1/3 of the crumbs, the rest of the
pudding mixture and topping with the balance of the crumbs.
Refrigerate 10-12 hours before serving.
Remove from refrigerator, decorate with flowers.
Serve by digging out portions with the trowel.
Serves 10 to 12.

Doree's Extravagant Almond Cake

cakes, fruits/nuts

1  unsalted butter & flour  for the ca; ke pan
1/2 lb almond paste
1 1/4 cup sugar
1 cup unsalted butter  at room temperatur; e
5  eggs
1 cup sour cream
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
3 cup unbleached white flour
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
      ----FOR GARNISH----
1  raspberry jelly
1  whole raspberries
1  powdered sugar

This is from Deborah Madison's "The Savory Way" (Bantam, 1990). When
the cake cools, slice it horizontally and spread it with raspberry
jelly or whole, sugared raspberries. Replace the top and dust with
powdered sugar.

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 325F. Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan.
Combine the almond paste and the sugar in a food processor and work
until well blended. Add the butter and continue to process until
blended; then add the eggs, one at a time, the sour cream and the
flavorings. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl. Sift the flour
with the baking powder, soda and salt. Add it to the batter a third
at a time, gently stirring in each cupful. Turn the batter into the
baking pan and bake the cake in the middle of the oven until the cake
is golden on top and springy to the touch, about 1 hour. Remove the
cake from the oven and let it stand to cool slightly; then turn it
out onto a serving plate. When cool, dust it with sifted powdered
sugar. This cake will keep well, wrapped tightly for several days.
Makes 1 large cake.

Doris Day's Peach Angel Food Cake *

cakes, fruits

      ----PATTI  VDRJ67A----
1 pkg angel food mix
2 cup heavy cream
1 lb fresh peaches
1 teaspoon ascorbic acid or lemon juice

" I wonder how they manage to sift so much glamour into a package
mix. The peaches and cream of this, my favorite recipe, are like
adding solid lyrics to music that sings alone...even the best can be
improved." Doris Day

Prepare angel-food mix according to directions. After mix cools, cut
into 3 layers. Whip cream until it stands in peaks. Peel, slice,
sweeten peaches to taste. Dissolve ascorbic acid (or) lemon juice and
add to prevent discoloration. Spread part of whipped cream on one
layer of cake, cover with peaches. Repeat, stacking layers on top of
each other. Top off with peaches and whipped cream. Serve
immediately. (A saw-toothed knife is best for cutting angel food
cake.) Saw, don't cut!

Drop Scones (Bakestone Recipes)

breads, cakes, breakfast

4 oz self-raising flour
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1  egg, beaten
5 fl oz milk*

*Approximate.  -- Sift the flour into a mizing bowl and mix in the
sugar. Make a well in the center of the flour and drop in the egg.
Stir in the milk gradually and mix to a creamy batter. The thicker
the batter, the thicker the pancake will be.  Heat the bakestone and
grease lightly. Using a large spoon, drop the batter off it in round
"puddles" onto the bakestone, leaving room for spreading. Cook over a
moderate heat until the top surface is covered with bubbles, and when
the underside is golden, turn and cook the other side. When golden,
lift off the bakestone and wrap in a cloth.  Serve as soon as
possible with butter, honey and preserves. If any are left until the
next day, they can be crisped under the grill before serving. For a
change, 1 oz of butter can be rubbed into the flour and sugar:  or
lemon essence (six drops) can be added to the batter.

special occasions and always at Christmas time. When my grandmother,
Oma, would visit us from Holland, she would expect it with her
coffee. Once, when i went to Holland, for a visit, my aunt served me
some, but it just didn't taste as good as the one at Oma's house. I
was told my aunt's cake was store bought. My mother passed Oma's
recipe on to me, and now i carry on the tradition."

rind. Set aside. CAKE: In a bowl, sift together flour, cinnamon,

Early American Graham Cracker Cake(The United

cakes, deserts

      ----INGREDIENTS----
1 3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs; about 40 crackers.
1/3 cup unsifted flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup almonds; shelled
1/3 cup walnuts; shelled
1/2 cup soft butter
2  eggs
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon or 2 teaspoons butter
1 tablespoon flour
      ----EQUIPMENT----
1  measuring cups
1  medium mixing bowl
1  measuring spoons
1  mixing spoon
1  chopper or paring knife
1  8-in.-square cake pan

How to Make:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Cruch the graham
crackers with hands until you have 1 3/4 cups coarse crumbs about the
size of bread crumbs. Put the cracker crumbs into the mixing bowl
with the flour, baking, and sugar.  Stir with the spoon until they
are combined. Chop the almonds and walnuts into small pieces. Add the
soft butter, eggs, milk, vanilla and chopped nuts to the dry
ingredients. Stir the mixture well. Then beat the batter until it is
well blended. Grease the cake pan with the butter. Sprinkle with the
tablespoon of flour and shake the pan until bottom is evenly coated.
Shake out an extra flour. Bake the cake for 45 minutes. Test with a
toothpick for doneness. Remove the from the oven let it cool
slightly. Cut it into squares and serve warm.

Topping:  You might want to sprinkle powdered sugar or spread whipped
cream on top.

STORY:  Thanks to Dr. Sylvester Graham, you can bake this crunchy
cake from crackers named after him. Graham, who lived in the early
1800's insisted that whole wheat flour was far more healthy then
white flour. In those days, it was.  Whole wheat flour was made by
grinding the whole grain of wheat.  For white flour, only the soft
inside of the grain was used. The outer layers, rich with vitamins
and minerals, were left out. Today, white flour is "enriched" with
the need vitamins and minerals. But whole wheat is still naturally
healthy. So are the graham crackers, made from this flour. Use them
for this one-bowl cake. It's all American.

Easter Babka - Martha Stewart Living

cakes, deserts, easter

2 cup milk
1/2 lb (2 sticks) unsalted butter
2 pkg (2 t) dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
4 large eggs
4 large egg yolks
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1  zest of 2 oranges
1  zest of 1 lemon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon orange-flavored liqueur
9 cup sifted unbleached flour
1 cup slivered almonds, chopped
1 cup muscat raisins
1 cup golden raisins
3 tablespoon confectioners' sugar (opt.)
1 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar mixed with
1/4 cup lemon juice and
1 teaspoon water, for glaze

In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, scald milk. Add butter and
stir until melted. Remove pan from heat and let mixture cool to
lukewarm.  In a small bowl, stir yeast into warm water; let sit for 5
to 10 minutes, or until foamy.  In a large bowl, beat eggs, yolks,
and sugar until thick. Add salt, zests, vanilla, and liqueur. Stir to
combine. Stir in milk mixture, then yeast.  Add flour, a cupful at a
time, until dough is moist but not sticky, mixing with a wooden spoon
or your hands. Stir in almonds and raisins.  Knead dough on a floured
board, adding more flour if dough is too sticky, until dough comes
away from your hands, about 6 minutes. Place dough in a very large
buttered bowl.  Cover dough with a damp cloth and let rise until
doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down and let rise again until doubled,
45 minutes to 1 hour.  Heat oven to 350'. Butter three 9-or 10-inch
kugelhopf or angel-food-cake pans. Sprinkle pans with a tablespoon of
confec- tioners' sugar, if desired. Divide dough into 3 portions and
form into balls; arrange in pans and cover loosely. Let dough rise to
tops of pans, about 30 minutes.  Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until
cakes are golden brown and tops make a hollow sound when tapped with
knuckles. Cool for 5 minutes in pans; turn out onto racks and cool
for 20 minutes more. Spoon glaze onto babka, allowing it to drip over
sides.

Edna Lewis's Christmas Fruitcake

cakes, fruits, holiday, christmas

1 cup glazed candied orange peel
1  .  diced
1 cup glazed candied lemon peel
1  .  diced
2 cup citron; diced
1 cup currants
2 cup seedless raisins; chopped
1/2 cup dry red wine
1/2 cup brandy
3 1/2 cup flour; all-purpose
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoon nutmeg; grated
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground mace
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup + 6 tbsp butter; softened
2 cup brown sugar; packed
5  eggs; separated
1/2 cup sorghum molasses

Mix all the fruit in a large bowl and pour in the wine and brandy.
Stir gently and set aside to marinate for a few hours.

Butter a 10-inch tube pan or two 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pans and line
it (or them) with clean parchment paper. Butter the paper.

Sift the flour with the spices twice. Add the baking powder and salt
and sift again.

Put the butter into a large mixing bowl and cream until satiny. Add
sugar and, using an electric mixer, cream until light and fluffy.
Beat the egg yoLlcs slightly and then add them to the bowl. Mix the
batter well before you start to add the flour-spice mixture. Stir the
batter as you add the flour, a litde at a time, stirring well after
each addition. When the flour is thoroughly incorporated, add the
molasses and stir. Finally, stir in the fruit and any soaking liquid
in the bowl.

Put the egg whites in a grease-free bowl and beat with a clean beater
until they hold stiff peaks. Fold them into the batter thor oughly
and then spoon the batter into the prepared pan (or parns). Cover
loosely with a clean cloth and let the batter sit overnight in a cool
place to mellow.

On the next day, heat the oven to 250 degrees. Place the fruitcake on
the middle rack of the oven and bake for 3 1/2 to 4 hours. After 1
1/2 hours, cover the pan with a piece of brown paper (do not use
foil) or set the pan in a paper bag and return it to the oven.

When the cake has baked for 3 1/2 hours, remove it from the oven and
listen closely for any quiet, bubbling noises. If you "hear'' the
cake, it needs more baking. Or test the cake with a toothpick or cake
tester. If the toothpick or tester comes out of the center of the
cake clean, the cake is ready to take from the oven. Put it on a wire
rack to cool, still in the pan.

When the cake is completely cool, turn it out of the pan (or pans),
leaving the brown-paper lining on the cake. Wrap the cake with
parchment, then aluminum foil, and pack the cake in a tin. Homemade
fruitcakes need air, so punch a few holes in the lid of the tin or
set the cover loosely on the tin.

Set the tin in a cool, undisturbed place, and every two or three weeks
before Christmas, open the foil and sprinkle the cake with a liqueur
glassful of brandy, wine, or whiskey. The liquor will keep the cake
moist and flavorful and help preserve it as well.

Eggless Butterless & Milkless Cake

cakes

2 cup sugar water
1/2 cup shortening
2 cup raisins
1 teaspoon cinnamon
3 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon cloves, ground

"This is fun to make and everyone who came to my house had a second
serving and might have had more but unfortunately by that time it was
all gone. This recipe came from a cookbook published in 1917 during
World War 1 when cooks had to skimp." Anne's note: this is also
called "War Cake" or "Victory Cake" in some cookbooks. It might be
suitable for vegans (is shortening derived from animals?)

Into a saucepan, measure sugar, water, shortening and raisins. Boil
for 4 minutes. Cool. Sift together and add remaining ingredeints.
Bake at 350F for 40 minutes.

Elegant Tea Cakes

cakes, cookies

1/2 cup butter
1 cup granulated sugar
1  egg
1 tablespoon cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Serve these not-too-sweet cookies in the traditional English fashion
with your favorite cup of tea. They are delicious with a dab of jam
or marmalade and hold up well when dunking.

In a bowl, cream butter with sugar until very light. Add well beaten
egg, cream and vanilla. In a separate bowl, sift flour with baking
powder; add creamed mixture and blend well. Roll dough into a log and
wrap in aluminum foil. Chill overnight, or in freezer for 2 hours if
rushed for time.

Preheat oven to 350. Remove dough from refrigerator, slice very
thin and place on greased cookie sheet. Bake 5-8 minutes at 350.

Variations: For various holidays decorate with colored sugar, beads
or icing. Or substitute almond or lemon extract for the vanilla to
vary the flavor.

German Friendship Cake

cakes, sourdough

1 cup cake starter
      ----STARTER FOOD----
1 cup milk
1 cup flour, self-raising
1 cup sugar
      ----CAKE----
2 cup flour, self-raising
1 cup sugar
2/3 cup oil
2 teaspoon cinnamon
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2  eggs
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup nuts (or other fruits)
15 oz pineapple chunks, drained (one can)

PREPARE STARTER:

Day 1:  Blend the starter feed together, and then hand mix in the starter.
I find it easiest to mix the flour and sugar together dry, add the milk to
the starter, and then slowly add the flour and sugar to the liquid. The
starter should never be beaten with a blender or refrigerated. Pour the
mixture into a large bowl, cover with cling-film or a damp towel, and leave
to brew.

Day 2:  Thoroughly mix the sourdough, then leave to brew again.

Day 5:  As day 1

Day 6:  As day 2

Day 10:  Print off three copies of this recipe.  Here now is why this is
called a friendship cake.  Take 3 cups of Sourdough mixture, and give them
away with copies of the recipe  as starters to your friends. Then proceed
with the baking.

MAKING THE CAKE:  Blend all ingredients thoroughly with remaining starter.
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Pour mixture into a well-greased baking
tin. Bake for 1 3/4 hours (less in a fan oven), cool.

NOTES:

*  A 10-day Sourdough cake -- This is known as the friendship cake, it's a
bit like a chain letter in that you have to find a set of friends to pass
on the starter to.

During preparation put the starter into a very large bowl (it foams up),
and cover with a lid or with cling film. Yield: Starter and one cake.

*  If you don't get cake starter from a friend, you can probably buy it in
a baking supply store.

*  Vary the spices to taste.  The cake is quite pleasant if you forget
them.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 days brewing starter, 30 minutes preparing cake, 2 hours baking
and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Ginger Ginger Cake

cakes, deserts

3 cup flour; all-purpose, sifted
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
6 oz candied ginger (abt 3/4 cup)
3 1/2 oz ginger; fresh *
8 oz butter; unsalted (2 sticks)
2 3/4 cup sugar; granulated
6 single eggs; large, separated
1 cup sour cream

Adjust a rack 1/3 up from bottom of oven and preheat oven to 350F.
Butter a 10x4 1/4-inch angel food tube pan (it may be a 1 piece
non-stick pan) with an 18 cup capacity; butter pan even if it has a
non-stick finish. Dust it all over with fine, dry bread crumbs,
invert over paper and shake out excess crumbs and set the pan aside.
Sift together the flour and baking soda and set aside. Cut the
candied ginger into 1/4 to 1/3-inch pieces and set aside.  Grate the
fresh ginger and set aside. In the large bowl of an electric mixer,
beat butter until soft. Gradually beat in the grated fresh ginger and
2 1/4 cups of the sugar (reserving the remaining half cup). Then,
beat in the egg yolks. On low speed, gradually add the sifted dry
ingredients in two additions, alternately with the sour cream in one
addition.  Remove the bowl from the mixer.  Stir in half of the
diced, candied ginger (reserve the remainder). Set aside. In the
small bowl of the electric mixer (with clean beaters) beat the egg
whites until they hold a soft shape. Reduce the speed to moderate and
gradually add remaining half cup of sugar. Then increase the speed
again and beat only until the whites hold a peak when the beaters are
withdrawn. In three additions, fold the whites into the batter; with
the first 2 additions, fold only partially, don't be too thorough and
with the last addition, do not fold more than necessary to
incorporate the whites. Turn into the prepared pan and smooth the
top. Sprinkle the reserved candied ginger on top. Bake for about 1
hour, or, until a cake tester inserted gently into the cake comes out
clean.  (The cake will not rise to the top of the pan). Let the cake
cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes. (The cake will sink about 1
inch as it cools).  Then cover the pan with the cakeplate and,
holding the pan the plate firmly together, turn them over and remove
the pan and let the cake cool.  This is a Maida Haetter recipe. *a

allow them to air-dry and cool before greasing. Use a pastry brush to
grease the jars. DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret!

In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Stir in margarine, water and
molasses until well blended. Pour into prepared pan or divide equally
among the 5 jars. Place jars on a cookie sheet or they'll tip over.

PAN METHOD: Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 40-50 minutes or
until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool slightly
on wire rack.

JAR METHOD: Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 35-40 minutes or
until cake tester inserted deep into the center of each jar comes out
clean. Have your lids ready (HOT). Take one jar at a time from the
oven (USE HEAVY DUTY MITTS--the jars ARE HOT!) and place a lid on,
then the ring. Tightly screw on lids. Allow to cool on your counter
top. You'll know when the jars have sealed, you'll hear a "plinking"
sound. If you don't hear the sound, wait until the jars have cooled,
then press down on the jar lids, they shouldn't move at all. Lynn

Gingerbread Baked In Jars

cakes, deserts

2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
3/4 cup margarine, softened
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup molasses

Preheat oven to 325-degrees (NO higher).

Sterilize 5 (12 oz) Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400-81400) jam/jelly
canning jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Remove
the jars from the water and allow them to air-dry on your counter
top; leave the lids and rings in the hot water until you're ready to
use them.

Once the jars are cool enough to handle, use a pastry brush to
grease them with shortening (DO NOT use butter, margarine, PAM or
Baker's Secret); set aside.

In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder,
salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Stir in margarine, water and
molasses until well blended. Divide batter among the 5 jars (they
should be about 1/2 full). Place jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll
tip over.

Bake in preheated 325-degree oven for 35 minutes or until cake
tester inserted in center comes out clean. Move the jars around in
the oven while they're baking, so they'll bake evenly.

Have your HOT lids ready. Using HEAVY-DUTY MITTS (the jars ARE
HOT!) Take one jar at a time from the oven and place a lid on, then
the ring. Tightly screw on lids--do it FAST because the lid gets REAL
hot! Allow jars to cool on your countertop.

Once the jars are cool, decorate with round pieces of cloth.
Unscrew the ring (the lid should be sealed by now) and place a few
cotton balls or a wad of batting on top of the lid (makes it poof-y
on top), then a piece of cloth (about 3" larger than the lid) on top
and screw the ring back on. Decorate as desired. I used pinking
shears to cut the cloth rounds out, otherwise some material will
start to unravel. A hot glue gun is INVALUABLE--glue on dried
flowers, bows, ribbons, etc.

Girdle Scones(Scottish)

cakes, scottish

8 oz flour
1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 oz butter
1 teaspoon golden syrup
1  buttermilk, or
1  full cream milk or
1  sour milk

Tip:- To test for the correct heat of the girdle sprinkle it with a
little flour. If the flour browns at once it is too hot; it should
take a few seconds to turn colour.

Sift the flour into a bowl. Add the other dry ingredients and mix.
Rub in the butter. Add the syrup and sufficient milk and mix with a
palette knife to a soft consistency. Turn On to a floured surface and
roll quickly and lightly (handle as little as posible) to about 1/4
inch thick. Cut in rounds. Grease and heat the gridle and, with a
slice or broad knife, turn once until brown on both sides. Serve
freshly baked, spread with butter.

Glazed Apple Cake

cakes

3  mc intosh apples; about 1 1/2 lb., cored an
1  lemon peel; fresh, 2 strip
1/2 cup unsalted butter; softened
1 cup sugar
1  large egg
2 1/4 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg; fresh grated
1/4 teaspoon cloves; ground
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup pecans; finely chopped, toasted
2  granny smith apples
1/4 cup apricot jam; strained
      ----GARNISH----
1  -whipped cream; optional

In a large saucepan combine the McIntosh apples with the water and
lemon peel, bring the water to a boil and simmer the apples, covered,
for 20 minutes, or until tender. Cook the mixture, uncovered, over
moderately high heat, stirring, until the water is almost evaporated.
Force the mixture through a food mill into a bowl, and allow the
puree to cool. (I zap it in my food processor, until it is a puree).

Generously butter a 9" springform pan and preheat the oven to 350
deg. F. In a large bowl cream the butter, beat in the sugar and beat
the mixture until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and the apple
puree. Into a bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon,
nutmeg, cloves and salt. Stir the flour mixture and the pecans gently
into the apple mixture and pour the batter into the springform pan.
Peel and core the Granny Smith apples, halve them lengthwise and cut
them crosswise into thin slices. *Arrange the apple slices
decoratively in bunches on the batter, pressing them lightly into the
batter.
Bake the cake in the middle of the oven for 1 1/4 hours, or until a
cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cake
to a rack.

In a small saucepan melt the jam over low heat, brush it over the
cake and let the cake cool in the pan on a rack for 20 minutes. Run a
sharp knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake and remove
the sides of the pan.  Serve the cake warm or at room temperature
with the whipped cream, if desired.  Note: If you prefer, substitute
3 large firm pears to make the fruit puree.  Use 2 firm but ripe
unpeeled pears, halved lengthwise, cored and cut into thin slices for
the top of the cake.

Note:* You should be able to make about 14 groups bunches of the
sliced Granny Smith Apples, and arrange them in 12 groups around the
cake, with two groups in the center, sort of like a flower. Press the
slices in, keeping the round side of the slices up, and pressing them
straight into the batter. This is a lovely looking cake. I have only
made it once...it was quite simple, yet very elegant looking and
different.

Goldy's Dream Cake

cakes

4 1/2 cup flour
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup butter
2  egg; beaten
1 1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon almond extract
1 lb cream cheese; softened
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
2  egg; beaten
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup raspberry preserves
2/3 cup almonds, raw

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Grease two 9" springform pans.

Combine flour with 1 1/2 cups sugar, and cut in the butter until the
mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Reserve two cups.

To the remaining crumb mixture, add the first two eggs, sour cream,
salt, baking powder, baking soda, and almond extract. Mix, and spread
over the bottom and up the sides of the pans.

Combine the cream cheese with the vanilla, the remaining eggs, and
1/2 cup sugar.  Spread half of this mixture over the batter in each
pan.

Spread the raspberry preserves on top of the cream cheese mixture in
each pan.  Whirl the almonds in a food processor until chunky.
Combine with the reserved crumb mixture and sprinkle over the
preserves on each cake.

Bake cakes 45 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick tests clean. Cool
the cakes at least half an hour before attempting to serve. This
works better if made the night before and refrigerated.

Gourmet's Genoise Cake

cakes, deserts

4 large eggs
2/3 cup sugar
2/3 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 cup clarified butter, melted and ooled; to lukewarm

In a metal bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar. Set bowl on a pan
of simmering water, and whisk mixture until it is warm and the sugar
is dissolved. Remove bowl from pan and, with an electric mixer, beat
at moderate speed for 10-15 minutes or until it is triple in volume
and cooled to room temperature.

Meanwhile, sift flour with salt onto a sheet of wax paper. In a bowl,
combine the vanilla and butter. Sift and fold flour mixture into the
egg mixture in batches until the mixture is just combined. Stir a
fourth of the mixture into the butter, and fold the butter mixture
back into the batter.

Line bottom of a buttered 8-1/2-inch springform pan with wax paper,
butter the paper and dust with flour, shaking out the excess. Pour
batter into the pan, smoothing the top.

Bake in the middle of a preheated 350f oven for 30-35 minutes or
until a tester comes out clean.  Let the cake cool in the pan on a
rack for 5 minutes, then remove side of pan, and invert onto the
rack. Remove paper carefully and let cake cool completely.

1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar

Mocha Whipped Cream Filling (recipe next post)

Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees. Butter two 9-inch layer pans and line the bottoms with
parchment paper circles. Rebutter parchment paper.

Put broken graham crackers and coconut into the container of a food
processor fitted with steel blade. Process until the cracker crumbs
and coconut are ground very fine. Add the baking powder and pulse 6
to 8 times to blend.  Set aside.

Cut the butter into 1-inch pieces and put them in the large bowl of an
electric mixer fitted with beaters or paddle attachment. Soften on low
speed.  Increase speed to medium-high and cream the butter until
smooth and light in color, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.

Add the sugar, 1 Tbsp at a time, take 6 to 8 minutes to blend it in
well. Scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally.

Add the the yolks, 2 at a time at 1-minute intervals, scraping the
sides of the bowl as necessary.  Beat 1 minute longer. Blend in the
vanilla.

Reduce mixer Speed to low.  Add the crumb mixture alternately with the
milk, dividing the crumbs into three parts and the liquid into two
parts, starting and ending with the crumbs. Scrape the sides of the
bowl and mix for 10 seconds longer.  Transfer to a large bowl and set
aside.

Put the egg whites in a separate bowl and beat them on medium speed
with clean dry beaters or whip attachment until frothy. Add the cream
of tartar and increase the speed to medium high. Beat until the
whites form firm moist peaks.  With a 2 3/4 inch wide rubber spatula,
fold in one quarter of the whites to lighten the batter, taking about
20 turns. Fold in the remaining whites, taking about 20 additional
turns.

Spoon the batter into the prepared pans, smoothing the surface with
the back of a tablespoon.  Bake in the preheated oven 25 to 30
minutes, or until cake begins to come away from the sides of the pan
and is springy to the touch.

Remove cake from oven.  Set the pans onto cake racks for 10 minutes
to cool slightly, then invert onto racks sprayed with nonstick
coating. Lift off the pans and carefully peel off the parchment. When
the cake is completely cool, fill and frost.

Grand Marnier Lb. Cake

cakes, pound

1 cup 2 sticks unsalted butter
1 2/3 cup sugar
2 cup all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup grand marnier liqueur
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
5 single eggs
1 pkg 12 oz chocolate minichips
1  glaze:
1/4 cup orange juice
1/4 cup grand marnier
1/4 cup sugar

CAKE:  Peheat the oven to 350F. Generously butter a 10 in (9 cup)
fluted tube pan; then springkle it with flour, tapping out the
excess. Set aside.
In a large bowl with the electric mixer on high speed, beat the
butter until creamy. Gradually beat in the sugar and continue beating
until the mixture is light and fluffy. Turn the mixer speed to low.
Sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat just until the flour
is absorbed. Beat in the Grand Marnier and orange zest. Beat in the
eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add
mini-chips. Spread the batter in the prepared pan, smoothing the top
even. Bake until the cake shrinks from the side of the pan and a
skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 1 hour and 5
minutes.  Let stand in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then
carefully unmold the cake onto a second rack placed over a pieve of
wax paper or aluminum foil.

GLAZE: Meanwhile, combine the orange juice, Grand Marnier, and sugar
in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over moderate heat. Lower the
heat and simmer until the mixture forms a light syrup, about 5
minutes. Then brush the syrup all over the warm cake. When it is
cool, transfer it to a serving plate.

3 teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup milk
2 cup floured blueberries
2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

MIX TOGETHER BUTTER, 2 CUPS SUGAR, 4 EGGS, BAKING POWDER, SALT,
VANILLA AND MILK. ADD FLOUR AND MIX WELL. FOLD IN THE FLOURED
BLUEBERRIES. LINE A 9" X 13" PAN WITH ALUMINUM FOIL. POUR THE BATTER
INTO THE PAN AND SPRINKLE THE TOP WITH MIXTURE OF 2TB SUGAR AND 1 TS
CINNAMON. PREHEAT OVEN TO 350. BAKE FOR 45 MINUTES. REMOVE FROM PAN.
ALLOW TO COOL BEFORE REMOVING ALUMINUM FOIL. NOTE: COATING THE
BLUEBERRIES WITH FLOUR STOPS THEM FROM SINKING IN THE
BATTER. THE ALUMINUM FOIL PREVENTS THE CAKE FROM PULLING APART
IF ANY OF THE BERRIES STICK, THIS PROVES OUT TO BE BETTER THAN
GREESING THE PAN. GOOD LUCK, GRANDMA ROSE.

Gumdrop Cake

cakes

4 cup flour
2  eggs
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cup applesauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 lb raisins, white
1/4 teaspoon cloves, ground
8 oz gumdrops (no black ones; 2 standard bags)
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
12 oz coconut, shredded (1 standard bag)
1 cup butter
1  walnuts, to taste
2 cup sugar

Cream together butter, sugar and eggs in one bowl.  In another bowl, mix
the dry ingredients together (flour, salt, soda and seasonings). Add the
flour mixture to the butter mixture half at a time, alternating it with the
applesauce.  Pick all the black gumdrops out and eat them or throw them
away. Add the nuts, raisins, coconut and remaining gumdrops; blend well.

Line 2 large loaf pans or 5 small loaf pans with wax paper! (Grease won't
work).  Fill pans about 2/3 full.  Bake at 300 degrees F. for about 2
hours. Let cool for about 15 minutes before you try to remove the loaves
from the pan. They should just fall right out when turned upside down, then
peel off the wax paper.

NOTES:

*  Cake with gumdrops, applesauce, raisins and coconut.

: Difficulty:  easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food
processor is tedious.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 2 hours baking, 15 minutes cooling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

The smaller gumdrops work best when you go to cut the cake.  I can never
find small gumdrops that are not 'spice drops', so I buy the large ones and
cut them into quarters. The cake also slices a lot better when almost
entirely cool. If you try to cut a piece while it's still hot, it'll taste
GREAT, but it will crumble all over.

Ha Rageel

cakes, star trek

      ----VULCAN CARROT LOAF----
1 1/2 cup carrots; grated
1  grated rind & juice of lemon
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
3  eggs; large
2 tablespoon water
1 cup golden raisins
1 1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  confectioners sugar

Note: It has never ceased to amuse Dr. McCoy that Mr. Spock, with all
his logical training, cannot consider Ha Rageel a close equivalent to
Tufeen Hushani. Actually, to the logical Vulcan mind, a ceremonial
wedding cake is quite unrelated to an "everyday" dessert loaf. It is
quite true that they contain many of the same ingredients and have a
somewhat similar taste. But this no more makes them related than the
same number of eyes and legs makes first cousins of horses and dogs.
To a cook the difference is also important. Preparing the wedding
cake requires time, attention, and care to avoid a minor disaster;
with Ha Rageel you can hardly go wrong.
Preheat the oven to 350. Grease a 2-quart ring mold with a little
butter.
Peel the carrots and grate them. Grate the yellow rind off the
lemon, using the coarse set of teeth on your grater. Leave enough of
the white inner rind so that you can squeeze the lemon for its juice
when you are done grating.
Cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture is somewhat
light colored. Add the eggs, mix well, then add the carrots, lemon
juice and rind, water and raisins.
In a smaller bowl mix together the dry ingredients, exept the
confectioners sugar, and add them to the liquid part a bit at a time.
When it is well mixed, pour the batter into the greased mold. Bake
for about 40 minutes, or until a knife or skewer stuck into it comes
out clean. Let it cool for about 5 minutes, unmold on a serving plate
and dust with confectioners sugar.
Note: If you dust the plate with a little confectioners sugar
before you unmold the cake onto it, the cake will tend to stick to it
less.

1 1/4 cup cake flour
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup salad oil
1/4 cup water
5  large eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 cup milk
3 1/2 cup coconut,shredded
1 cup whipping cream
      ----RASPBERRY COULIS----
1 quart raspberries
1 tablespoon sugar

1. FOR CAKE. Sift flour; measure 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons. Sift again
with 1/3 cup sugar and baking powder into a large bowl. In another
bowl, whisk oil, water, 1 egg, and 1 teaspoon vanilla; add to flour
mixture and whisk until smooth.
2. Separate remaining 4 eggs; put yolks in a small bowl. In a clean
bowl, beat egg whites and cream tartar with a mixer until foamy.
Gradually add 1/4 c sugar, beating until whites hold firm, moist
peaks. Gently fold whites into flour mixture.
3. Spread batter in an ungreased 9" cheesecake pan (at least 2 1/2"
deep) with a removeable rim. Bake in a 350'F. oven until cake springs
back when lightly touched in center, about 30 minutes. Run a knife
between cake and rim; invert cake onto rack. Remove rim; slide a
spatula along pan bottom and remove. Let cool; if made ahead, store
airtight up to 1 day.
4. FOR PASTRY CREAM. In a 1 1/2 to 2 quart pan, mix 1/3 cup sugar and
1 1/2 tablespoons flour. Whisk in milk. Stir over medium-high heat
until boiling, 4-6 minutes. Whisk about 1/2 cup hot mixture into
yolks. Stir yolk mixture into pan; whisk over medium-low heat until
slightly thicker, 30-90 seconds. Stir in 1 1/2 cups coconut and 1
teaspoon vanilla. Let cool, stirring often. Cover and chill until
cold, at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.
5. TO ASSEMBLE CAKE. With a long serrated knife, cut cake
horizontally into 3 equal layers.
6. In a bowl, whip cream with 2 tablespoons sugar until thick enough
to hold its shape; fold 3/4 cup into pastry cream. Chill remainder.
7. Invert cake onto a platter. Slide rimless baking sheets under each
of the 2 layers and lift off. Tuck wide strips of waxed paper just
under bottom edge of cake. Spread layer almost to edge with half the
pastry cream. Slide middle layer onto filling; spread with remaining
filling. Slide last layer onto filling. Frost cake with remaining
whipped cream. Pat remaining coconut into cream. Cover gently; chill
2 hours or until next day.
8. Ease out waxed paper and discard. Pour raspberry coulis equally
onto dessert plates; top with cake wedges.

*** RASPBERRY COULIS ***
In a blender, whirl raspberries. Rub through a fine strainer into a
bowl; discard seeds. Add sugar. If made ahead, chill airtight up to 1
day; stir to use.

Halloween Pumpkin-Shaped Cake

cakes, holiday, kids

2 pkg cake mix, prepared
2 can white frosting
1  food coloring
1  hostess ho-ho (or similar cake-roll; snack item)

This is actually more a method than a recipe, but given the recent
requests for Halloween goodies I thought it might be of interest. I
originally saw this in Parents Magazine about two years ago.  It has
been a favorite for our family celebrations since then!

Prepare two cakes in bundt pans, cool completely. Color most of the
frosting a deep orange, reserving about 1/2 c , which should be
colored black (you may also use dark chocolate fudge frosting). Place
one bundt cake upside down (rounded side on the bottom) on cake
plate; frost top only.  Place second bundt cake flat-side down on top
of first cake. Frost entire cake with orange frosting, making up and
down motions with spatula to simulate pumpkin. Insert Ho-Ho in the
middle of the top of the bundt cake to make the stem. Use black
frosting to make eyes, nose, mouth, etc. Black rope licorice may also
be used.

Heaven & Hell Cake

cakes

1  angel food:
2/3 cup cake flour
1 cup confectioners sugar
1 cup egg whites (7 or 8)
1  pinch of salt
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
2/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1  devil's food:
1/2 cup powdered cocoa
1 cup strong coffee
1/2 cup shortening
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2  eggs
1 1/2 cup cake flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking poweder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1  peanut butter mousse
1  (recipe follows)
1  ganache
1  (recipe follows)

To make the angel food: Heat oven to 375 degrees. Cut parchment paper
or wax paper to fit the bottom of a 10 inch round cake pan. Do not
grease the pan or paper.

Sift together the flour and confectioner's sugar.  Set aside.

Place egg whites in bowl of a heavy duty mixer.  Beat slowly while
adding the salt and cream of tartar; then continue beating for 1
minute or until soft peak form. Increase speed to medium ; add sugar
by Tablespooons until it is all incorporated, then beat 1 1/2 minutes
longer. When egg whites have stiff peaks, add vanilla and almond
extracts.

Remove bowl from mixer and sprinkle half of the confectioners'
sugar-flour mixture over the egg whites. Fold in with a rubber
spatula; sprinkle with remaining with remaining sugar-flour mixture
and fold again using a minimum number of strokes so that the egg
white do not deflate. Gently spoon the mixture into prepared pan and
bake 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden brown. Do not overbake or the
cake will sink in the center.

To make the devil's food:  Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour
a round 10-inch cake pan.

Sift cocoa into a mixing bowl, then drizzle in the coffee while
whisking to make a smooth paste.  Set aside.

Combine shortening, sugar, vanilla and eggs, and beat for 2 minutes at
medium speed.

In a separate bowl, sift togethr the flour, salt, baking powder and
baking soda.

Alternately add the cocoa-coffee mixture and flour mixture to the
sugar-egg mixture and continue beating until incorporated. Pour
batter into prepared pan and bake for 30 minutes.

To assemble cake:  When both cakes have cooled, carefully slice them
in half horizontally with a sharp serrated knife (the longer the
better) so that you have 4 cake layers.

To slice the angel food cake, spray knife with oil. Holding the top
of the cake with your flat open hand, use a sawing action to slice
through. Do not put pressure on the knife or the cake might tear;
just let the sawwing action do its work. (If the cake sinks in the
center, fill it in with some extra mousse.  Make this the top layer
and it will be easier to level off)

Place 1 layer on the devil's food cake on a plate and spoon a third
of the Peanut Butter Mousse on top.  Add a layer of the devil's food
cake on a plate and spoon a third of the Peanut Butter Mousse on top.
Add a layer of the angel food , then spread with another third of the
mousse. Add second devil's food layer, then reamining mouse. Top with
remaining angel food layer.

Whisk the Ganache, then spread over the cake with a spaaatual,
frosting the top and sides generously. Refrigerate for a least 2
hours before serving. Served chilled, slice with a warm wet knife.

Helen's Carrot Cake

cakes

4  eggs, separated
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 cup carrots, grated
1 cup walnuts, finely grated
1 1/2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 cup oil
2 1/2 teaspoon water, hot
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
      ----FILLING----
8 oz cream cheese
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup jam (strawberry, apricot or raspber; ry)
      ----FROSTING----
1 cup whipping cream
2 tablespoon sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together egg yolks and about 1 cup of
the sugar until the yolk color lightens.  Stir in carrots, nuts, flour,
baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, salt and oil. Mix together hot
water and soda and stir into flour mixture.

Beat egg whites until foamy.  Gradually add remaining sugar.  Beat until
stiff and glossy. Fold egg white mixture into flour mixture.

Turn mixture into a greased pan, 13 x 9-inch, lined with greased wax paper
and bake for 45 minutes or until done. Cool. Slice in half horizontally, to
form two layers.

Make the cream cheese filling:  soften the cream cheese and beat in the
sugar, mixing gradually, until the filling is smooth and fluffy. A food
processor works well for this.

Cover bottom layer with cream cheese filling, then cover cream cheese layer
with jam.  Place the top layer of the cake carefully on top of the jam.

Make the frosting:  beat the whipping cream until slightly stiff, then add
the sugar and beat the mixture to stiff peaks. Frost the entire cake with
whipped cream.

NOTES:

*  Carrot cake with cream cheese filling -- I got this recipe originally
from _The Oregonian_ in Portland, Oregon.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling, 10 minutes
frosting.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Hershey's Fudge Cake

cakes

1 3/4 cup unbleached flour, unsifted
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable shortening or
1  vegetable oil
1 1/2 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup cocoa (less if using dutch
1  process)
1/4 cup plus 2 to 3 tbls hot water
1 cup milk mixed with 1 tbls
1  water (to make sour milk)

This has been one of the most popular cakes Hershey has ever
introduced. I have made it since the 1950's so I would consider it a
classic. Grease the bottoms and sides of two 9 X 1 1/2-inch layer
cake pans and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, blending
well, and set aside.  Cream the shortening and sugar, with an
electric mixer set on high, and beat in the eggs and vanilla extract
and continue beating until light and fluffy.  Blend the cocoa into
the hot water to make a smooth paste. Gradually add the cocoa mixture
to the creamed mixture, stirring to blend well.  Add the flour
mixture alternately with the milk to the creamed mixture, beating
well after each addition. Pour the batter into the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the tops
spring back when lightly pressed. Cool on racks for 10 minutes and
remove from the pans to cool completely. Frost with
Chocolate-Buttercream Frosting (Next Recipe).

Hopeless Twinkles

cakes

      ----THE FILLING----
1/2 cup butter or margarine
3/4 cup pet or carnation evap.  milk
1/2 cup crisco
1 cup sugar, granulated
1 tablespoon vanilla
      ----THE CAKE----
3  eggs, large
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup milk, whole
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 cup flour, all-purpose

The Filling:

Cream the butter 5 minutes, medium speed. Add Crisco a little at a
time. Cream another 3 or 4 minutes. Add the sugar a little at a time
while continuing to beat. Then add the milk, mixed first with the
vanilla, beating and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl
frequently. The longer you beat this the better it becomes.

The Cake:

Preheat oven to 350. Grease two 8-inch-square cake pans or baking
dishes, or use a 13x9x2-inch pan. Beat 1 minute after each addition.
Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes (40-45
minutes for an oblong pan) or until you can insert a toothpick and it
comes out clean. Cool the cake in pan on a rack. It's best to use the
cake for Twinkles when it is slightly frozen - about 30 minutes in
the freezer. Then cut them into 1-1/2 by 3-1/2 inch bars. Put bottom
side of each bar up on waxed paper. Spread half of the bars with the
filling and put together with an unfrosted bar, sandwich style.
Refrigerates up to 2 weeks, freezes up to 1 year.

Ices

cakes, candy

1  water
1  sugar
1  fruit

*Colorings*.  --For *Blue* rub a piece of indigo with a little water
and add by drops to the mixture to be colored until the desired shade
is reached. For *Brown* use grated chocolate, or for a very light
brown, *Caramel*, which is prepared for immediate use by putting cup
granulated sugar in *iron* skillet or frying-pan set over fire, and
stirring, constantly until a dark brown color and as thick as
molasses. When properly done a cup sugar will make five tablespoons
coloring. When preparing for bottling, boil a longer time, then add a
half pint water and boil again, until a little cooled in saucer is
found thick as molases or honey. If too thick, or if it candies, add
a little more water and boil again. Bottle, and if kept corked it
will never spoil. For *Green* use either the Parsley or Spinach
Coloring, given on page 180. For *Pink* use strawberry, currant or
cranberry juice or jelly. If a bright *Red* is desired, Mix one
drachm each pulverized alum and cream tartar, four drachms powdered
cochineal, two ounces loaf sugar and saltspoon soda; or
sameproportions in level tablespoons are two-thirds tablespoon
pulverized alum, half tablespoon cream tartar, two and a half of
powdered cochineal, four of pounded oaf sugar and the saltspoon soda;
boil ten minutes in half pint pure soft water and when cool bottle
and cook for use. For *Yellow*, use the juice of a carrot or the
grated peel of an orange or lemon, moistened withthe juice or a
little water, and squeezed through a cloth. When a deeper color is
wanted boil a little American saffron with a little water till a
bright yellow, strain and cool, and use enough to give desired shade;
some use a mixture ofan ounce turmeric with four of deodorized
alcohol shaking till dissolved and then straining and bottling. No
objection can be made to the use of any of the above, save perhaps to
the blue, which is very seldom used, and only for Ornamental Icing,
The others are all fruit or vegetable preparations, and their use
adds greatly to the handsome appearance of ices and ice-creams, icing
jellies, cakes, creams and pudding and other sauces. To guard against
getting in too much coloring, use by putting in a very little at
first, mixing well, then add a very little more until desired shade
is obtained.

Irish Whiskey Cake

cakes, deserts

      ----CAKE----
8 oz raisins
1  grated rind of 1 lemon
150 ml whiskey
6 oz softened butter
3  eggs
6 oz soft brown sugar
6 oz plain flour
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground cloves
1 teaspoon baking powder
      ----ICING----
1  juice of 1 lemon
8 oz confectioners' sugar
1  warm water as needed
1  crystallized lemon slices*

*As garnish, if desired.  -- Put the raisins and grated lemon rind
into a bowl with the whiskey, and leave overnight to soak. Grease a
7-inch cake pan, and line the bottom with parchment; preheat oven to
350F. Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Separate the
eggs and sift the flour, salt, cloves and baking powder into a bowl.
Beat the yolks into the butter and sugar one by one, including a
spoonful of flour and beating well after each addition. Gradually add
the whiskey and raisin mixture, alternating with the remaining flour.
Do not overbeat at this stage. Finally, whisk the egg whites until
stiff and fold them into the mixture with a metal spoon. Turn into
the prepared pan and bake in the preheated oven for about 1 1/2
hours, or until well risen and springy to the touch ~- or test with a
skewer: when it comes out clean, the cake's ready. Turn out and cool
on a wire rack. .
Meanwhile, make the icing by mixing the lemon juice with the sieved
confectioners' sugar and just enough water to make a pouring
consistency. Put a dinner plate under the cake rack to catch the
drips, and pour the icing over the cake a tablespoonful at a time,
letting it dribble naturally down the sides.  Don't worry if a lot of
it ends up on the plate underneath ~- just scoop it up and put it on
top again.  When the icing has set, it can be decorated with
crystallized lemon slices if you like.

Jar Cakes

cakes, deserts, info

1 x no ingredients

Ever baked cakes in canning jars? It's neat! ANY quick bread-type
cake can be baked in canning jars.

I usually bake one jar first -- you have to know how high the batter
rises. I usually fill ONE jar 1/2 full then bake it to see how high it
rises, then go from there. You don't want the cake to come out of the
top of the jar, only to within 1/4 to 1/2 inch from the lip of the
jar. Write it down on your recipe (how far you filled the jars)! Once
you've established how high the cake rises, you can go from there.
The first time around is a bit tricky because you won't know how many
jars you'll need. MOST of the recipes I've tried I end up using
around 8. Sterilize as many jars as you think you'll need and go from
there. Make sure your LIDS are new, the rings don't have to be As the
jars do seal, the cakes are as moist as the day you put them into the
jars--sometimes MORESO.

The baking times will vary -- the moistness of each cake recipe will
determine the time. MOST of the recipes I've tried bake in 35-40
minutes. Start checking the cakes at 25- 30 minutes and go from there.

YES, the cakes DO slide easily out of the jars IF you use the jars
I've listed. They're Ball 12-oz Quilted Crystal Canning Jars
(#14400-81400). They can be found at most grocery stores (at least
here in California) next to the pectin and other canning supplies.
Also, I've seen the 12 oz straight-sided (plain) jars (# ?) at Smart
& Final. The plain jars work fine too but they're not as pretty and
you have to make your own labels--the jars I use come with decorative
labels. One IMPORTANT tip--get your jars NOW! Once summer's over with
they're very hard to find. Also, when you can, ask for the jars back,
they're NOT cheap. Most folks don't mind returning them though, they
usually want refills! <G>

There will be a little condensation on the lids and some in the
jars so when you seal them it's trapped inside. Don't worry about
getting the water off of the lids before placing them onto the jars,
the added moisture doesn't hurt the cakes in the slightest. Quick
bread-type cakes work best, I've found that lighter cakes tend to
fall when the jars seal.

I'm trying to address every question that's been asked of me
before, I HOPE I've done that. If I've missed anything or if anyone
has any questions, don't hesitate to ask. These make WONDERFUL
Christmas gifts and you cn start NOW! Single friends really
appreciate these because each jar makes enough for one or two people.
I'll post the recipes I've made in my next notes. Try them, they're
FUN and delicious to boot! Be right back with a few more tips...

Several folks have asked me how long the cakes can be safely
stored...I'm not sure. The longest I've been able to keep them
(without getting eaten) is 6 months. The jars DO seal, just like any
canned good. You don't have to refrigerate the jars, just keep them
in a COOL, dark, dry place. I've only had 6 jars go bad on me and
that was my fault...put them in a cupboard that got too hot and the
seals broke. I now check the jars at least once a week by pushing
down on the lid (in the middle); if the lid moves up and down, that
means the seal has broken. If you've checked the jars frequently,
more than likely they're safe to eat; otherwise, toss the cake. I've
been making cakes in canning jars for over 3 years and haven't
poisoned anyone so far. :)  If you give the jars away, be sure to
tell the person to check the jar periodically (if they plan on
storing it for any length of time).

Not only are the cakes tasty, they're very pretty to decorate. A
hot glue gun is INVALUABLE! You cn glue on dried flowers, ribbons,
dough-art ...you name it, it can be glued onto the lid, ring and side
of the jar. I usually cut out a piece of cloth (about 3 inches larger
in circumference than the lid), using pinking shears (so the cloth
doesn't unravel), place a wad of cotton or batting in the center of
the lid (take the ring off -- the jar lid should be sealed by now),
then place the piece of cloth on top and replace the ring. Decorate
to your heart's desire!

There are probably a few more tips I've forgotten...if anyone has
any questions, don't hesitate to ask. Don't limit yourself to the
recipes I've given you...ANY quick-bread type cake cn be baked in
canning jars. Lighter cakes tend to fall once the jar seals.

Be right back with the first recipe...

Jello Rainbow Cake

cakes, deserts

1 pkg white cake mix
2 pkg jello (3 oz) any flavor
2 cup boiling water
1 pkg cool whip, thawed (8 oz)

Bake cake mix as directed on package.  Remove from pans to cool.
Rewash pans and put cakes back in them when the cakes are completely
cooled. It is best to use 2 8-9" round cake pans but you can use an
oblong pan if you want.  After cakes have been place back into pans
(top side up), prick them with utility fork at 1/2" intervals.
Meanwhile, dissolve each flavor separately in 1 cup boiling water.
Carefully pour one flavor gelatin over each cake layer (if using
oblong pan you must use the same flavors for the 2 pks).
Chill 3-4 hours.  Dip one cake pan in warm water for 10 sseconds,
then unmold cake layer onto serving plate. Top with about 1 c. cool
whip. Unmold second cake layer and carefully place on first layer.
Frost with remaining topping.  Chill.  Great moist'n fruity cake
especially for those who like a light, refreshing cake that is not
too sweet.

June Meyer's Authentic Hungarian Coffee Cake

cakes, coffeecake, hungarian

1  10 in tube pan
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup melted butter (no margarine)
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2  cakes yeast
3  eggs
4 1/2 cup flour
      ----MIXTURE TO ROLL DOUGH IN----
1/2 cup soft butter melted
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

This coffee cake consists of balls of coffee cake dough made in a
round tube cake-pan with nuts, cinnamon and a syrup-like glaze on the
outside. This recipe is not a quick one. It uses yeast in the dough
and that means a 2 1/2 to 3 hours spent in raising the dough. It is a
good recipe for a lazy Saturday or Sunday. I always double the recipe
to make two. One for the freezer and one for afternoon coffee.
Regards, June Meyer.

Mix sour cream, sugar, salt and yeast. Stir until yeast dissolves. Add
eggs, softened butter and half the flour. Mix well and add rest of
flour. Turn dough out on floured board and knead until smooth for
about 10 to 15 minutes. Place in greased bowl. Cover and let rise in
warm place until double in bulk for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punch
dough down. Turn over and let rise again for 45 minutes. After second
rising, form into walnut-sized balls. Melt butter in small cup. Dip
each ball in melted butter and roll in sugar and walnut and cinnamon
mixture. Place in layers in 10-inch greased tube pan. Sprinkle any
remaining sugar-nut mixture or melted butter over the top layer of
balls. Cover pan with waxed paper and towel and let dough rise again
45 minutes. Bake 40 to 50 minutes at 375 degrees or until golden
brown. Run spatula around sides of coffee cake, and invert onto
plate. To serve, break coffee cake apart with two forks.

Key Lime Cake (2 Of 2)

cakes, deserts

1 x no ingredients

To make cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush the
inside of an 8-inch (6-cup) bundt or a 9-inch (8-cup)
spring form tube pan with margarine or oil or spray
with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. In a small
mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking powder and
salt. In a large mixing bowl, beat margarine (or
butter and oil) with electric beaters until softened
and blended. Gradually add sugar and beat until well
blended. Gradually beat in eggs. Beat in lime zest and
juice. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula,
alternatively stir the dry ingredients and buttermilk
into the egg mixture, beginning and ending with the
dry ingredients. Spoon the mixture into the prepared
pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a cake
tester inserted into the center comes out clean and
the cake starts to pull away from the sides of the
pan. Loosen edges and invert onto a wire rack set over
a plate. To make syrup: In a small bowl, whisk
together confectioners' sugar and lime juice. While
the cake is still warm, poke holes in it using a
skewer or cake tester. Slowly spoon the lime syrup
over the cake, spooning any juice that accumulates on
the plate below over the cake. (The cake can be
prepared ahead and stored, covered, in the
refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Bring to room
temperature before serving.) Just before serving, sift
a little confectioners' sugar over the cake. Serves 8.

tree, with its thorny branches, produces yellow limes
that resemble small lemons. Since Key limes can be
expensive and are not always easy to find, Persian
(green) limes or bottled Key lime juice from the local
grocery store can be substituted.

Key Lime Shamrock Torte

cakes, deserts, vegatarian, vegetarian

2 pkg firm silken tofu
3/4 cup brown rice syrup
1/2 cup honey
3/4 cup lime juice
1 tablespoon agar powder
4 tablespoon arrowroot
2 tablespoon corn oil
1 each carob cake, see recipe
2 each kiwi fruits
      ----GLAZE----
1 teaspoon agar powder
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup brown rice syrup
2 drop mint extract

Blend the tofu, brown rice syrup, honey, lime juice,
agar, arrowroot & corn oil until smooth.  Transfer to
a double boiler & heat till the mixture thickens.  It
should reach the consistency of heavy cream.  Set
aside to cool.

Split the carob cake into 2 layers (you'll need only 1
layer).  Line a 9-inch cake pan with a sheet of
plastic wrap.  Place one layer of cake in the bottom
of the pan & refrigerate while the filling is cooling.

When the filling is cool, pour it into the cake &
refrigerate until the filling sets completely (about 2
hours).

Peel the kiwi fruit, cut it into thin slices & fan out
the slices over the entire torte.  Glaze if desired by
pouring a thin layer of still warm glaze over the cool
cake.  Refrigerate the cake again for 10 minutes
before cutting it.

To serve, remove the cake from the pan by lifting out
on the plastic wrap.

GLAZE: In a small pot, dissolve the agar in the water.
Add brown rice syrup & mint extract.  Bring to a
simmer & remove from heat.  Allow to cool slightly.

Killer Strawberry Shortcake

cakes, fruits, deserts

1  bisquick drop biscuits

This is a really easy dessert, loaded with calories, and not for the

Make the bisquick drop biscuits as directed on the package, BUT add 1
tb of sugar (or 2, if you like). Bake as directed.

While still warm, cut in half and put the bottom half in a bowl.
Cover with fresh strawberries (which you have marinated in 4 Tb sugar
in the refrigerator for 2 days), add a scoop or two of French vanilla
ice cream, and then top with the top layer of the biscuit.

Now, cover with more strawberries and top with fresh whipped cream.
Enjoy!

Make the chocolate cookie wafers: Position a rack in the lower third of the
oven and preheat to 275 F. Generously butter two large baking sheets. Cut a
3 1/2 inch circle out from plastic coffee can or similar lid. Discard the
center. The outer rim of the lid will be used as a stencil for the wafers.

stiff egg white/sugar mixture. Fold in the vanilla and half of the melted
butter. Fold in another third of the flour mixture. Fold in the rest of the
melted butter and the flour mixture.

Ma'amool B'jowz - Sweet Walnut Cakes

cakes

1  stephen ceideburg
750 gm semolina
1 cup sugar
500 gm butter
500 gm walnuts
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup cold water
1/2 teaspoon rosewater

Mix thoroughly in a large bowl 750 g semolina and 1 cup sugar. Melt
500 g butter until bubbling, then blend it into the semolina-sugar
mixture. Knead well then set aside for at least one hour or up to 24.

Knead the mixture again then pour in enough boiling water to make a
soft, pliable dough (wear rubber gloves so you can handle the hot
mixture).

Crush 500 g walnut pieces finely (this can be done in a food
processor) and add to 1/2 a cup of sugar. Mix 1/4 of a cup of cold
water with half a teaspoon of rosewater (any Lebanese or Asian food
store) and mix the liquid into the walnut-sugar mix- ture.

Mould the pastry into balls about 5 cm in diameter. Make a cavity in
the centre of each ball with your finger and fill with walnut
mixture. Close the pastry over the top of the filling and flatten the
stuffed pastry ball a little between your hands. Make a design on top
with the tines of a fork

Place these cakes on an ungreased baking tray and cook at 230 C until
lightly browned, approximately 20 minutes. Store in an airtight
container and sift icing sugar generously over the top of each layer
of cakes.

Macaroon Cake (Gateau Sec Aux Noisettes)

cakes

100 gm flaky pastry (3 1/2 oz)
30 gm raspberries (1 oz)
110 gm sugar (3 3/4 oz)
75 gm ground hazelnuts (2 1/2 oz)
2 single egg whites
1  grated rind of 1 lemon
1  caster sugar
1  icing sugar
1  slivered almonds

Puree the raspberries in a liquidiser with 35 g ( 1 1/4 oz) of the
sugar, then pass the mixture through a tamis.

Prepare a macaroon paste by mixing, with a spatula, the rest of the
sugar, the ground powered nuts, the egg whites and lemon rind.

Roll out the pastry to a thickness of 2-3 mm ( 1/8 in) and line an 18
cm ( 7 in) tart tin with a removable base. Prick it all over with the
prongs of a fork (Put it in a refrigerator if you are not going to
bake it at once).

Pre-heat the oven to 220 oC/425 oF.

Lightly sprinkle caster sugar over the uncooked pastry, then spread
the raspberry puree over it in a smooth layer.

Spread the macaroon mixture over the raspberry, smoothing the surface
with the help of a spatula.

Cook the cake for 40 minutes in the pre-heated oven. Reduce the heat
to 180 oC/350 oF after 20 minutes if it is browning too quickly. Take
it out and leave it to cool a little.

Scatter the slivered almonds over the top of the cake while it is
still warm. Sprinkle the cake with icing sugar then put it under hot
grill for just long enough to caramelise the sugar lightly. Take
care, as this takes barely a minute.

Let the cake cool, then take it out of the tin.

Malted Fruit Loaf

breads, cakes

6 oz soft light brown sugar

2 tablespoon malt extract *
3 medium eggs, slightly beaten
3 oz wholemeal self raising flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
8 oz dried mixed fruit
2 teaspoon caster sugar to sprinkle
1  spiced butter to serve**

*Malt extract is a dark syruup available in jars from most health food
shops. It gives a moistness & deliciously malty flavour to cakes. **
To make spice butter, simply beat 1/2 tsp ground mixed spice into
75g/3oz butter Preheat oven to 180C/360F Grease a 2lb loaf tin and
base-line with greased greaseproof paper. Place the brown sugar,
butter and malt extract in a large bowl and beat well until pale &
fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, 1 Tbsp at a time. Sift the flours
and cinnamon into the creamed mixture (making sure any bran remaining
in the sieve from the wholemeal flour is also tipped into the bowl.)
Using a metal spoon, gently fold in the flours and cinnamon, followed
by the dried fruit. Spoon the mixture into the tin. Bake in the oven
for 1 hr. 10 min. until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out
clean. Cover the top of the cake if it is browning too quickly. Leave
to cool in the tin for 5 min. then turn out on to a cake rack and
allow to cool completely. Sprinkle with sugar and serve with spiced
butter if liked.

Maltese Almond Cakes (Kwaresimal For Lent)

cakes, cookies, holiday, maltese

1 1/8 cup almonds, slivered; blanched 10 oz
3 1/2 cup flour; sifted
1 1/2 cup sugar; up to 1 13/4 cups
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 teaspoon orange extract
2 each lemon; grated rind of
2 each oranges; grated rind of -or- tange
      ----OPTIONAL----
1  honey
1  almonds; toasted ,slivered

Toast the almonds on baking sheet for about 5 minutes at 400F. Reset
the oven for 350F. Grind one-third of the almonds. Mix the ground
almonds with the flour, sugar, and cinnamon. Add the orange extract
and the rinds. Mix well. Blend in the slivered almonds. Gradually,
add enough water to make a stiff dough (the dough will be sticky).
Form the dough into cake about 7 inches long, 2 inches wide and 1
inch thick. Bake for 35 minutes. Optional: While they are still hot,
brush the Kwaresimal with honey, and sprinkle with slivered toasted
almonds. Let the cakes cool for about 20 minutes, then with a
serrated knife cut them into slices about 3/8 inch thick. Variations:
Here are a few of the classic variations: Hazelnuts can be
substituted for the almonds. You can if you prefer all of the nuts,
or fewer of them. You can also insert some whole blanched almonds.
Remember the more nuts you grind to a powder, the more liquid you
will need to make the dough; and the fewer nuts you grind, the less
liquid. In Malta these cakes would often be made with orange-flower
water, which is hard to obtain here. Orange extract or liqueur (or
other liqueur or rum) can be used as a part of the liquid.

Mango Mousse Cake

cakes

      ----CAKE----
1/2 cup sifted cake flour
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs, separated (room temp)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup sugar, divided
      ----MOUSSE----
2  envelopes unflavored gelatin
1/2 cup water
4 large to 5 ripe mangos (1 lb each)
1 cup confectioners' sugar divided
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup sour cream
      ----ASSEMBLY----
3 tablespoon seedless raspberry jam
2 cup toasted sliced almonds
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoon granulated sugar
1  mango slices, for garnish
1  fresh raspberries, garnish

Make sponge cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter
bottom and side of a 10-inch springform cake pan. Line bottom of the
pan with a circle of baking parchment or waxed paper. Dust side of
the pan with flour and tap out excess. In a small bowl, whisk
together flour, baking powder & salt. Sift flour mixture onto a piece
of waxed paper. In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set
at high speed, beat egg yolks and 2 tb of granulated sugar for 4 to 6
minutes, until batter is pale yellow and forms a thick ribbon. Beat
in vanilla.

Beat egg whites at low speed until frothy. Gradually increase speed
to high and continue beating soft peaks start to form. One ts at a
time, gradually add remaining 2 tb of sugar and continue beating
whites until they form stiff, shiny peaks. Scrape 1/3 of whites on
top of beaten egg yolks. Resift 1/3 of flour mixture over whites &
fold flour mixture and egg whites into egg yolk mixture, making sure
to free any flour that may be clinging to side of the bowl. One-third
at a time, gently fold in remaining whites with 1/3 of resifted flour
mixture. Do not overfold. Scrape batter into prepared pan. Bake cake
for 8 to 12 minutes, until center springs back when gently touched.
Cool cake in pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove from pan & cool
completely.

Make the mango mousse: Put water in a small heatproof cup. Sprinkle
gelatin over water and let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Place cup
with softened gelatin in a saucepan with enough water to come halfway
up side of cup. Heat gelatin mixture in hot, not simmering water.
Stir gelatin mixture frequently for 2 to 3 minutes, until gelatin
granules dissolve completely and mixture is clear. Remove pan from
heat. Leave cup containing gelatin mixture in hot water to keep
gelatin warm until ready to use.

Peel mangos and cut fruit away from pit. Cut fruit into large chunks.
Combine half of mango chunks with 1/2 cup of sugar in bowl of a food
processor. Process mangos for 40 to 60 seconds, until pureed. Transfer
pureed mangos to a large saucepan. Repeat with remaining mangos and
1/2 cup of sugar. Cook the mango mixture over medium-low heat,
stirring constantly until warm. Remove saucepan from the heat. Add
the gelatin mixture and vanilla and whisk until blended. Transfer
mango mixture to a large bowl and cool to room temperature. In a
chilled large bowl, beat the heavy cream and sour cream until mixture
forms soft peaks. Fold 1/3 of whipped cream into mango mixture to
lighten it. Fold in remaining whipped cream.

Assemble cake: Remove side from a 10-by-3-inch springform pan. Trim a
12-inch cardboard circle so that it fits snugly within curved lip of
bottom of springform pan. Reattach side of springform pan. Remove
paper circle from bottom of cake. Spread raspberry jam in an even
layer over top of cake. Place cake layer in bottom of prepared pan.
Scrape mango mousse over cake layer and smooth it into an even layer.
Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least
6    hours or overnight.

Unmold cake: Using a portable blow dryer or damp very hot towel,
carefully heat outside of springform pan until edge of mousse melts
slightly. Release clamp on side of springform pan and gently lift it
up and remove it from around side of the cake. Defrost cake in
refrigerator for at least 3 hours, until ready to decorate.

Decorate cake: Spread toasted almonds on a piece of waxed paper. Set
aside 28 of best almond halves to garnish cake. Lift cake up on
cardboard cake circle, supporting bottom of cake in one hand. Scoop
up almonds and gently press them against side of cake, working around
cake until side is completely covered. Put cake on a serving plate.
In a chilled small bowl, using a handheld electric mixer set at
medium speed, beat cream with the sugar until stiff peaks begin to
form. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large closed star tip (such as
Ateco #4) with whipped cream. Pipe 14 rosettes around top edge of
cake. Garnish each rosette with 2 toasted almond slices. Refrigerate
cake until ready to serve. by Lisa Morley, chef and owner of A Sweet

1 cup flour
6 each eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla (optional)

Separate eggs.  Put whites in large bowl, yolks in medium bowl. Sift
flour several times, put in small bowl. Beat egg whites until stiff,
but not dry. Set aside. Beat yolks until light, add syrup ( and
vanilla if desired). Beat again to mix well. Pour yolk syrup mixture
into whites and fold gently with wire whip until blended. Gradually
add flour 1 tbsp. at a time while folding mixture.  When blended,
pour in large tube pan. (It seems to come out best if this pan is
lightly greased with butter and dusted with flour). Bake at 325 for
about 1 hr.  Cool on rack, then remove cake from pan. This cake is
especially good with no frosting but berries and whipped cream. From

Maple Sponge Pudding Cake

cakes, deserts, puddings

1  unsalted butter; softened
3/4 cup sugar
2 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 cup milk
1/2 cup unsalted butter; melt/cool
1 cup maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  creme fraiche

Canadian food writer Anita Stewart shared this recipe that she
gathered at L'Escapade, an inn at Mont Tremblant, Quebec. With a few
modifications, it has become one of my standby quick-and-easy
desserts. The sauce poured over the top ends up on the bottom.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 2-quart glass casserole or
other baking dish.

In a bowl, combine the sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt and stir
to mix well. Whisk in the milk and 1/4 cup of the butter to blend
well. Scrape the fairly stiff batter into the prepared baking dish.

In a saucepan, bring the syrup to a boil. Remove from the heat and
stir in the remaining 1/4 cup butter and the vanilla. Immediately
pour the mixture over the pudding batter. Bake until puffy, bubbling,
and golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.

Serve warm. Offer creme fraiche or a pitcher of cream for topping the
pudding at the table.

Mexican Bean Cake

cakes, mexican, ethnic

1/3 cup butter or margarine
3/4 cup sugar
1  egg
2 cup unseasoned pinto bean puree*
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
2 cup peeled and diced apple
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped nuts
1 1/2 cup icing sugar (optional)
1  milk or fruit juice

"Mexican meals don't usually include cake, but this one--made with
bean puree and lots of fruit and spices--would fit right in with
Mexican food!" Jean's Beans by Jean Hoare page 112.

BEAN PUREE Start with 1 cup of dried beans or a bit more if using
large white limas and you plan to take off the skins. Extra bean
puree may be frozen-it looks like mashed potato. Quick Soak - Wash
beans, use 3 cups of cold water for each cup of beans and bring
slowly to a boil. Boil gently for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, cover
and let stand for 1 hour. Drain off soaking water.

Cover with fresh cold water, bring to a boil for 10 min, reduce heat
and simmer about 30 min until tender. Drain. Remove lima bean skins
and discard any hard beans. Grind through a foodmill, puree in a
blender or food processor.  You may have to add a bit of liquid saved
from the cooking process to get the mixture moving. Force the puree
through a sieve about 1/4 cup at a time if you want a very smooth
puree. Puree only keeps a day or two in fridge so freeze any that you
are not going to use for the recipe.

Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour the bottom only of a 9x13 inch
rectangular pan.

Cream butter with sugar.  Add egg and beat well. Blend in bean puree
and vanilla.  In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt,
and spices. Mix with the apple, raisins, and nuts. Add dry
ingredients and fruit to creamed mixture and blend well.  Pour batter
into prepared pan and bake 35-45 min or until cake tests done when
tried with a toothpick.

Mix icing sugar with enough milk or fruit juice to make a thin glaze;
drizzle over the still-warm cake. Keep in the refrigerator.

(My notes - I would make this again but leave off the glaze as it is
quite sweet.)  Shared by Elizabeth Rodier, reposted Nov 93.

Michael's Mocha Halo Cakes

cakes

1 1/2 cup sifted cake flour
1/2 cup cocoa
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup sugar
1  egg
2  egg yolks
1/2 cup cold strong coffee
1/2 cup buttermilk
      ----MOCHA ICING----
1 1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon coffee
1/8 teaspoon salt
1  egg yolk, well beaten
4 teaspoon cocoa
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla flavoring

Thought you might be interested in these two recipes for a birthday
cake. Michael, one of my roommates, just had his big 5-0. He said he
wanted a mocha cake so I hauled out a couple of fifty year old
cookbooks and put together this cake.  (Well, they were almost 50
years old++one was put out in '46, the other in '50.) The cake++the
first I'd ever made from scratch++turned out great.  It was nice and
moist, if a tad on the heavy side.  The recipe is actually for
cupcakes, but I just made one big layer. The frosting is outstanding,
a definite keeper.

Sift flour, cocoa, soda, baking powder and salt together 3 times.

Cream shortening with sugar until fluffy.  Combine whole egg and egg
yolks, beat well and add to creamed mixture. Combine coffee and
buttermilk. Add sifted dry ingredients and liquids alternately in
small amounts, beating well after each addition.  Pour into greased
cupcake pans and bake in moderate oven (350F) for 20 minutes.

Makes 18 medium or 12 large cupcakes.

Frost with Fluffy White Icing.  Melt 1 ounce (square) chocolate with 1
teaspoon butter and put a band around each cake with teaspoon or
pastry brush.

From "250 Classic Cake Recipes", edited by Ruth Berolzheimer,
Culinary Arts Institute.  Consolidated Book Publishers, 1950.

MOCHA ICING:

Sift sugar.  Cream butter.  Add sugar.  Beat until smooth. Add
remaining ingredients.  Beat until well blended.

Michel Stroot's Little Round Pound Cakes

cakes, deserts, sax

2 cup all-purpose flour, lightly
1  spooned into measuring cups
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1  lemon- the grated zest only
2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
5 large eggs, separated
1/4 teaspoon salt

Quatre-Quarts or Four Quarters is the French name for this recipe. It
refers to the proportion of ingredients (one-quarter each butter,
sugar, eggs and flour). In France, the cake is served with afternoon
tea but rarely as dessert.

Source: CLASSIC HOME DESSERTS by Richard Sax Recipe by Michel Stroot,
pioneering spa chef at "The Golden Door in California" who is from
Belgium

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter 8 small ramekins,
custard cups or tiny loaf pans; sprinkle with sugar, shaking out the
excess sugar to leave a very fine coating. Place the pans on a baking
sheet; set aside. Sift the flour onto a sheet of wax paper; set aside.

2. Beat the butter with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until
very creamy. Add the sugar and beat until very light, about 6
minutes. Beat in the lemon zest and vanilla; add the egg yolks and
beat for about 2 minutes longer. Lower the speed to slow, add the
flour and beat just until nearly blended, about 15 seconds, no
longer. The mixture will be stiff and slightly hard to blend at this
point; don't OVERMIX.

3. In a bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt at high speed until
nearly stiff, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir a large spoonful of the whites
into the batter; fold in the remaining whites until blended. Again,
you'll have to work and chop the somewhat stiff mixture slightly in
order to blend in the whites, but don't overblend. Gently spoon the
mixture into the prepared remekins or pans, filling each about 2/3
full.

4. Bake until the cakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in
the centers emerges clean, usually about 45 minutes (the timing can
vary with the molds being used).

5. Transfer to a wire rack and cool briefly. Run the tip of a knife
around the sides of the cakes to loosen them from the ramekins;
unmold and cool completely on the rack. You can either wrap the cakes
in plastic wrap, or return them to their ramekins and seal the tops
with plastic wrap.

1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
4  eggs
1/2 cup superfine sugar
1 tablespoon water
1  confectioners' sugar
2/3 cup blackberry jam
1  fresh blackberries
1  pesticide-free rose petals

Preheat oven to 425F. Line bottom of a 15x10x1" jelly-roll pan with
parchment paper. Butter parchment. Sift flour and baking powder into a
small bowl. Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs and sugar at high speed until thick

egg mixture, then fold in gently. Be sure there are no dry pockets of
flour. Fold in water.

Pour batter into pan. Spread evenly, smoothing top. Bake at 425F for
10 minutes until center springs back when lightly touched. While cake
is baking, sprinkle a 20" long sheet of parchment paper with sifted
confectioners' sugar.

Remove cake from oven and immediately run knife around edge of cake to

Miracle Cobbler

cakes, deserts

2 tablespoon butter
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup flour
1 cup milk
1  pinch of salt

Preheat oven 375 F. Melt the butter in a baking dish, allowing it to
cover the bottom and grease sides of dis. Mix remaining ingredints.
Batter will be thin. Pour into buttered dish, Over the batter spread
4 cups canned or fresh fruit. Bake in a moderate oven (375) about 45
minutes. The batter will rise through the fruit and form a brown
crust.

This recipe is vague on draining the fruit if canned, I would suggest
doing so, since the same amount of fresh fruit can be used also (
this contains no juice.)

cakes, frostings, asian, japanese

12 oz azuki beans - cooked
2 pkg gelatin, unflavored
1 1/4 cup sugar, granulated

dry. The beans may be refrigerated, tightly wrapped in the towel, for

to a boil, still stirring. Then pour the beans into an 8" cake pan,
cool and refrigerate overnight or until firm. Slice into 2" wedges
and serve as dessert or a swee course.
