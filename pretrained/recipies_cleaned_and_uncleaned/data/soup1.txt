Cuban Garlic Soup

soups, cuban

1 1/4 cup chicken broth
2 teaspoon olive oil
1  garlic clove, peeled and
1  crushed
1 slice cuban or french bread
1  egg
1  salt and freshly ground
1  pepper to taste
1 teaspoon parsley, minced
2 teaspoon queso blanco, hard, grated

Bring the chicken broth to a boil.  In a small skillet, heat the oil.
Add the garlic and saute until golden and aromatic. Place the bread
in a large soup bowl, pour the oil and garlic over it, add the
boiling chicken broth, and immediately break the egg into the soup.
It will cook in 2 to 3 minutes.  Add salt and pepper, and sprinkle
with parsley and cheese.

NOTE:  There are dozens of quesos blanco, or white cheeses, which is
exactly how the name translates. Some are soft, some fresh, but many
aged. Queso blanco generally mild flavored, though some of the aged
ones can be quite tangy.  They are found in markets in Florida and in
most cities with colonies of residents of Caribbean, Cuban, or
Mexican ancestry. Try the cheeses and choose the one that suits your
taste.

Cucumber Soup With Pistou

soups, vegetables

1 tablespoon olive oil
1  leek (white part plus 1 inch of gre; en) chopped
1  stalk celery with leaves, chopped
1 lb cucumbers, peeled, halved, seeded,; and chopped
2 teaspoon lemon juice
4 cup chicken stock
1  pistou:
2  cloves garlic, finely minced
1/4 cup minced fresh basil
4 teaspoon finely chopped walnuts
2 teaspoon parmesan cheese
4 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 medium sized tomato, peeled, seeded, and c; hopped

To prepare the soup: In a medium-size saucepan, heat oil over low
heat. Add leeks and celery and cook until vegetables are soft, about
10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add cucumbers, lemon juice and
stock. Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce heat to low and
simmer for 20 minutes, or until cucumbers are tender. Cool slightly.
To prepare Pistou: With a mortar and pestle, mash together garlic,
basil and walnuts to a paste. (you can also use a bowl with a wooden
spoon). Work in a little cheese and oil and one-third of the tomato.
Keep adding cheese, oil and tomato. The mixture will not be a true
emulsion but a barely fluid paste.

Transfer cucumber mixture to a food processor or blender and puree, in
batches, until smooth.  Ladle soup into serving bowl. Pass the pistou.
Allow 1 tablespoon of pistou per serving to be placed in the center
of the bowl, then swirl into soup.

Curried Butternut Squash Soup

soups

4 tablespoon butter
2 cup onions, yellow, chopped
4 teaspoon curry powder
2  butternut squash
2  apples
3 cup chicken stock
1 cup apple juice
1  salt & pepper
1  granny smith apple

Squash and apples complement each other naturally; curry adds an
exotic note. Feel free to experiment with other types of winter or
summer squash.

Melt the butter in a pot. Add chopped onions and curry powder and
cook, covered, over low heat until onions are tender, about 25
minutes.
Meanwhile peel the squash (about 3 lbs). A regular vegetable peeler
works best. Scrape out the seeds and chop the flesh.
When the onions are tender, pour in the stock, add squash and the 2
apples (peeled, cored and chopped). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
simmer, partially covered, until squash and apples are very tender,
about 25 minutes.
Pour the soup through a strainer, reserving liquid, and transfer the
solids to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, or
use a food mill fitted with a medium disk. Add 1 cup of the cooking
stock and process until smooth.
Return the pur‚ed soup to the pot and add apple juice and additional
cooking liquid, about 2 cups, until the soup is of desired
consistency.
Season to taste with salt and pepper, simmer briefly to blend and
heat through. Shred Granny Smith apple, unpeeled. Serve soup
immediately, garnished with shredded apple.

Curried Squash & Mushroom Soup

low fat, soups, vegetarian

2 medium butternut squash, or acorn squash
2 1/2 cup water
1 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon butter, or oil
1 cup onion, chopped
2  cloves garlic, crushed
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon coriander
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 lb mushroom, sliced
1 dash cayenne, to taste
1  lemon juice, fresh
1  yogurt, for the top

1. Preheat oven to 375F Split the squash lenghwise, remove seeds, and
place face-down on a lightly oiled tray. Bake until soft (about 30 to
40 minutes.) Cool, then scoop out the insides. Measure out 3
cups'-worth place this in a food processor or blender with the water,
and puree until smooth. (You may need to do this in batches.)
Transfer to a kettle and stir in the orange juice.

2. Heat the butter or oil in a skillet, and add onion, garlic, salt,
and spices. Saute over medium heat until the onion is very soft -
about 8 minutes. (You may need to add a small amount of water to
prevent sticking.) Add mushrooms, cover, and cook about 10 minutes
over medium heat, stirring occasionally.

3. Add the saute to the squash, scraping the skillet well to salvage
all the good stuff. Add cayenne and heat gently. Once it is hot,
taste it to correct the seasonings. This is a fairly sweet soup; you
may choose to adjust this by adding the fresh lemon juice ..to taste
and topping each bowlful with a small spoonful of yogurt. Recipe by:

Combine lentils and 1 cup water in a deep pot. Whisk to crush some of
the lentils. Add the tomatoes, cumin, ground coriander, cayenne,

6 large tomatoes-chop
6 oz tomatoe paste
2 cup water
2 each garlic cloves-crush

Daube De Boeufs Aux Champignons Et A L'orange

stews

2 1/4 kg stewing beef  into large pieces, ea; ch  about 4 ounces
4  carrots; peeled and cut
1  into rounds
3 medium onions; coarsely chopped
2  garlic cloves
1  sprig of parsley
1  celery rib; thickly sliced
3  bay leaves
1 tablespoon thyme; fresh  or
1 teaspoon thyme; dried
6 centiliter marc de provence  or cognac
7 1/2 deciliter red wine; sturdy, such as  cotes de
1 tablespoon olive oil; (1) extra virgine
6 centiliter olive oil; (2) extra virgine
1 teaspoon peppercorns; whole black
3  cloves; whole
3 tablespoon butter; unsalted
500 gm mushrooms
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1  salt
1  pepper
1  orange; grated zest and  juice

One day before serving the stew: In a large nonreactive bowl, combine
the meat with the carrots, onions, garlic, parsley, celery, bay
leaves, thyme, marc, red wine, and the olive oil (1). Tie the
peppercorns and cloves in a piece of cheesecloth; add to the bowl and
toss well. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, stirring once or
twice. Let the meat and vegetables return to room temperature. With a
slotted spoon, remove the meat from the marinade. Drain well; pat dry
on paper towels. Set the vegetables aside. Transfer the liquid and
the cheesecloth bag to a nonreactive large heatproof casserole. Bring
to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 5 minutes to reduce
slightly. Remove from the heat. In a large skillet, melt the butter
in the olive oil (2) over high heat. When the foam subsides, add half
of the meat. Saute, tossing, until browned all over, about 5 minutes.
With a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to the liquid in the
casserole. Repeat with the remaining meat. In the same skillet, saute
the reserved vegetables until browned, about 7 minutes. Transfer the
vegetables to the casserole. Add the mushrooms to the skillet. Saute
until lightly browned, about 5 minutes; set aside. Stir the tomato
paste into the casserole. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.
Reduce the heat to very low and simmer, skimming occasionally, until
the meat is very tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Stir in salt and pepper to
taste, the mushrooms, and the orange zest and juice. Discard the
cheesecloth bag of cloves and peppercorns. (The recipe can be
prepated 2 to 3 days ahead and refrigerated. Reheat before serving.)
Serve with potatoes, rice, or pasta, and with the same wine used in
cooking, a sturdy red wine.

Daube De Queue De Boeuf

stews

      ----MARINADE AND OXTAIL----
4  cloves; whole
500 gm onions; peeled and  quartered
1  head of garlic; cloves  peeled and halved
250 gm shallots; peeled
500 gm carrots; peeled, into  2 cm (3/4 i
2 1/4 liter red wine; such as cote de  provence
1 bunch parsley; fresh
4  bay leaves
1 bunch thyme; fresh
1 teaspoon peppercorns; black
2 1/2 kg oxtail; into 10 cm  (4 in) pieces
      ----STEW----
300 gm salt pork; cubed
500 gm carrots; peeled, into  2 cm (1/4 i
1  salt
1  pepper; black
      ----FOR SERVING----
1  salt; coarse
250 gm rigatoni; or large macaroni

Oxtail is one of the most economical and most flavorful cuts of meat,
and one that takes well to marinating for days in a hearty mixture of
red wine, herbs, and vegetables. The longer you marinate the mixture,
the more flavorful it will be, but be sure it marinates at least 3
days. Oxtail is also a fatty cut ~- give yourself plenty of time to
allow the stew to cook and then cool, so all the fat can be skimmed
off. Serve this with thick noodles in warmed soup bowls, accompanied
by a tossed salad, and of course, a robust red wine. Stick a clove
into 4 onion quaters. Place all of the marinade ingredients through
the peppercorns in a large nonreactive casserole. Add the oxtail
pieces. Cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Remove the pan from
the refrigerator from time to time to stir and evenly distribute all
the ingredients. The day before you plan to serve the stew, remove
the casserole from the refrigerator. Remove the pieces of oxtail from
the marinade and drain well. In a heavy skillet, brown the salt pork
over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Add the pieces of oxtail,
in batches, and brown on allsides. Return the oxtail and salt pork to
the marinade, adding, if necessary, enough water to cover generously.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Carefully skim any impurities or
grease that rise to the top. Simmer, keeping the mixture bubbling
gently, until the meat is falling off the bone, at least 2 to 2 1/2
hours. Remove from the heat to cool. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, use a small spoon to remove and discard all the fat
that has solidified on top of the stew. Add the fresh carrots, salt,
and pepper, and cook again until the mixture is heated through,
checking for seasoning from time to time. To serve, bring a large pot
of water to a boil. Add salt and the pasta. Cook the pasta just until
firm. Drain well. Evenly divide the pasta among shallow soup bowls.
With a two-pronged fork, carefully remove the pieces of oxtail from
the stew. Drain, and place on a carving board. Remove the meat in big
chunks, and place them on top of the pasta. Carefully spoon the sauce
and the vegetables on top of the meat, sprinkle with just a bit of
coarse salt. Serve immediately.

Debbie's French Onion Soup

cheese/eggs, main dish, onion

4 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon flour
2 tablespoon oil
1 teaspoon salt
2 lb onions, peeled and thinly sliced
2 quart beef broth*
1 lb mozzarella cheese, shredded crouton; s** paprika (optional)
4  ovenproof soup bowls or crocks

Soup:  In a heavy 4 to 5 quart saucepan, melt butter with oil over
medium heat.  Stir in onions and salt and cook, uncovered, stirring
occasionally for about 30 minutes, until onions are a rich brown
color.  Sprinkle with flour and mix to blend; cook about 1 minute
more.  Remove pan from heat. In a separate saucepan, prepare beef
stock, if necessary (see below). Add the beef broth to the onion
mixture; return the pan to the heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the
heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for about 45 minutes.
Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper, if desired.

**Croutons:  While the soup is cooking, I usually just cut up a
sourdough roll into about 1" chunks, about bite size or a little
larger.  I put them on a pie plate or small cookie sheet and place in
a preheated 250 degree oven for maybe about 15 minutes or so, until
crisp but not toasted on top.  Then, I turn over and let dry for
another 10 minutes or so (you'll have to check them because I'm
guessing on times here).  You can butter and/or season the bread
before drying but I don't do so myself.

To serve:  Place a few croutons in the bottom of each ovenproof soup
bowl.  Add some mozzarella cheese on top. Ladle soup over cheese (the
croutons will rise).  Top with additional cheese.  Place the soup
bowls on a cookie sheet (I line mine with foil for easier cleanup).
Sprinkle with a little paprika, if desired.  Place the cookie sheet
under the broiler and broil until the cheese is melted and very
lightly browned. Remove and serve immediately but beware those hot
bowls!

*Beef broth:  I make my broth with a quality beef base which you can
often find in your local grocery store or order by mail order.  The
broth MAKES this soup so don't use plain bouillon etc.  You can
certainly make your own broth from scratch, if so inclined.  I am
currently using one called "Superior Touch Better Than Bouillon" beef
base from Vons.  I add 3 Tbsp. base to 2 quarts boiling water and
stir to mix, then add to the onions as described above.

Note:  My husband and I eat this as a full meal and it will serve
about 4 people that way, depending on the size of your bowls.

Serves:  4

Diet Cream Soup Base

crockpot, diabetic, soups/stews, allergy, low-fat/cal

1  white sauce
3 1/2 tablespoon instant milk powder
1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/4 cup cold water
1  tomato
8 oz can tomato sauce
3 tablespoon chopped onion
1 pinch dry rosemary, crumbled
1 pinch fresh ground pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper

This recipe is suitable for anyone who needs to know the exact
contents of soup. OTHER OPTIONS: Regular recipes use about 1 1/2 Tb
butter and 1 1/2 Tb flour per cup of milk for a medium white sauce.

5 oz evaporated milk plus 5 oz water plus 1 Tb corn starch

1 cup soy milk plus 1 Tb corn starch

1 cup skim milk plus 1 Tb vegetable oil plus 1 Tb corn starch

Put ingredients in a blender and process at high speed until well
blended, or put ingredients in a jar and shake, or stir dry
ingredients into cold milk with a whisk.

Stir constantly in the top of a double boiler until the sauce
thickens and simmers, then cook ten minutes. A medium saucepan set in
a larger saucepan of simmering water works, too.

Fresh tomatoes may be cooked with onion and seasoning, allowed to
cool and pureed in a blender to make the sauce. If the tomato mixture
is colder, add a little of the hot white sauce to bring it to the
same temperature. This prevents curdling when the red mixture is
gradually added back into the pot with the white sauce.

Heat soup until it is hot enough to serve but do not allow it to boil.

The same method may be used with 3/4 to 1 cup of cooked diced (or
pureed) vegetables with cooking liquid used to make the sauce. Makes
about 2 cups. Suggested vegetables:  potato with a little onion,
carrot, zucchini, cabbage with a little ham, sauteed onion, mushroom,
broccoli. Season to taste.

1  leek  cleaned & sliced coarsely
1 small carrot; peeled and sliced
1  celery stalk; sliced
2  shallots; peeled and chopped
1  garlic clove  peeled & minced
1 tablespoon tomato puree
1 1/2 cup dry white wine
2 quart water
1  chicken bouillon cube  crushed
1 pinch saffron
      ----HERB BOUQUET----
1/2 teaspoon thyme; and
1/2  bay leaf, and
6  fresh parsley stems (tied in cheese; cloth)
      ----FOR THE BISQUE----
1  salt and pepper to taste
4 tablespoon cornstarch
4 tablespoon non-fat powdered milk
1/2 teaspoon cognac, armagnac or brandy
4  basil leaves; minced
1 teaspoon tarragon, minced
1 tablespoon minced chives

SEPARATE THE TAIL from the shrimp and remove the meat, reserving all
shells, claws, heads and so forth. If you wish, devein the tails, then
cover and refrigerate. Coarsely chop the heads and shells, reserving 4
heads for decoration, if you have them. In a large saucepan, heat the
oil over moderate heat, then add the shrimp shells and cook them.
Stir slowly but continuously for 5 minutes. Add the vegetables and
tomato puree and cook another 5 minutes, stirring. Add the wine and
bring to the boil for 30 seconds, scraping the bottom to dissolve any
coagulated juices. Add the water, bouillon cube, saffron and herb
bouquet. Return to a simmer and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Pour the
stock through a fine strainer into a bowl, pressing down on the
vegetables and shrimp shells with a soup ladle to extract all of the
liquid. (For a finer result, strain again through cheesecloth.)
Return the stock to the boil. Moisten the cornstarch in a little cold
water, then add it to the saucepan and boil for 4 minutes. Taste for
salt and pepper. (The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point and
refrigerated.) Bring the stock to a simmer. Add the shrimp tails and
let them cook a bare 2 minutes (for small or medium), or 3 minutes
for extra large. Remove immediately with a slotted spoon and divide
them among 4 heated soup plates. Pour the stock into a blender, add
the powdered milk and cognac. Blend until smooth and homogeneous.
Pour immediately into the soup plates over the shrimp tails. Garnish
each dish with an equal amount of the herbs and a shrimp head
(optional).

This rich-tasting bisque has only 90 calories per serving.

off the excess. Reserve the flour mixture.

heat. Add the chicken, meaty side down, and cook for 1 1/2 minutes on
each side or until well browned. Remove to a plate with a slotted
spoon.

3.  Pour the broth into the flour mixture remaining in the bowl and
whisk until smooth.

4.  Drain the fat from the skillet and wipe it clean. Add the chicken
broth mixture and 2 tablespoons of the dill. Stir to mix. Add the
chicken meaty side up, and the potatoes. Bring to a boil over high
heat. Reduce the heat to low.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.

5.  Lay the asparagus over the top.  Cover and simmer for 15 to 20
minutes more, or until the chicken and vegetables are tender.

6.  Remove the pan from the heat.  Stir in the lemon juice and the
remaining 2 tablespoons of dill.

Do-It-Yourself Soused Peach Soup

fruits, soups, desserts

1 1/2 lb peaches; ripe freestone
1/2 cup sugar
1/2  lemon; juice only
3  or 4 gratings nutmeg
4 cup heavy cream or ice cream; melted
1  liqueurs and brandies
1  cookies

"An incredible dessert invitation to extend to special summer guests
when fresh fruit is at its best and you're feeling a little
extravagant. Who could resist the temptation to "mix your own" when
it comes to fruit puree, heavy cream, and a choice of liqueurs or
brandies?"

To facilitate peeling, place the peaches (or use nectarines) in
boiling water for 1 minute. Using a small, sharp knife slit the skin
and remove. Then pit and quarter the fruit and place it in a small
saucepan with water to cover, sugar, lemon juice, and nutmeg. Simmer
until tender, depending on the ripeness of the fruit, about 10 to 15
minutes. Cool. Puree or pass through a sieve and chill.

Serve in chilled bowls or very large parfait glasses. Pass the
pitcher of cream or melted ice cream, and cookies, and have on the
table a selection of liqueurs and brandies, depending on your taste
and pocketbook. I suggest any combination of the following:

creme de banana, cherry brandy, Amaretto, curacao, bourbon, anisette,
rum, sherry, coffee liqueur, Tuaca.

Also experiment with the softened ice cream; it need not be vanilla,
but should be delicate. The cookies could be any of your favorites,
but simple rich ones like macaroons or butter cookies such as Snowy
Cardamom Crisps are an unequalled match for this soup.

2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint
1 1/2 cup thick yogurt or sour cream

1  salt

Prepare the herb broth:  Place all ingredients in a saucepan with 5
cups of water.  Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for 10 to
15 minutes. Strain before using.

To make the soup:  In a heavy-bottomed soup pot, saute onion and leek
in olive oil until translucent.  Add chopped tomato. In a mortar and
pestle, pound the sun-dried tomatoes with their liquid to a paste,
then add to the pot with the sugar.  Continue cooking over a
moderately high heat for 2-3 minutes.  Stir in the garlic, grated
orange zest, and mint, and cook another 2-3 minutes. Gradually add
the herb broth, cover, then allow soup to simmer for 30-45 minutes
longer. (Soup may be prepared ahead of time up to this point.)

In a bowl, mix together yogurt and flour until smooth. Gradually add a
spoonful of hot soup, stirring contantly. Add another spoonful of
soup, then slowly add yogurt mixture to soup pot, stirring all the
while. Continue cooking soup over a gentle heat, stirring, being
careful not to let mixture curdle.

Adjust seasonings, then add the fresh parsley.  Serve immediately. Ms.

cheese as suitable accomaniments.

Double Chicken Broth Stock By James Beard~ Ch

soups

      ----INGREDIENTS PREVIOUSLY MADE----
2 1/2 quart chicken stock; (see other recipe)

Put the previously prepared, cold, fat-free, 2-1/2 quarts of chicken
stock in an 8 quart pan. Add a whole stewing fowl or roasting chicken
weighing between 4 and 5 pounds. Bring slowly to a boil. Skim off any
scum that forms on the surface; reduce heat; cover and simmer gently
until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour for a young chicken,
or 2 to 2-1/2 hours for a fowl. Remove the chicken/fowl and either
serve it as poached chicken, or remove the skin, take the meat from
the bones, and use it for other dishes such as chicken salad, hash,
chicken pie, or creamed chicken, etc. Strain the broth through
several thicknesses of cheesecloth into a bowl; let cool, then skim
off the fat. You now have 2 quarts of beautifully rich, strong broth
which can be used for cooking. Should you want to reduce it even
more, and clarify it for consomme' ... see the recipe: Chicken
Consomme' by James Beard. For chicken consomme' the broth must be
absolutely fat-free and clear. Therefore, it's important that you
strain the above through several thicknesses of cheesecloth, let
cool, and skim off all the fat.

Double Pea Soup

soups, low-fat

1 tablespoon olive oil
3 medium yellow onions, finely
1  chopped
3  cloves garlic, minced
4  scallions, including tops,
1  thinly sliced
2 cup chopped lettuce (boston,
1  iceberg, or red leaf)
1/4 cup minced fresh mint or 2 tsp.
1  mint flakes, crumbled
1 teaspoon ground ginger
6 cup water
1 1/2 cup dried split green peas
1 teaspoon salt
10 oz package frozen green peas,
1  thawed
2 cup skim milk
1  parmesan cheese for garnish

Heat the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven for 1 minute. Add the
onions and garlic and saute stirring occasionally, until limp, about
5 minutes. Add the scallions and toss to coat with the oil, then stir
in the lettuce, mint, and ginger. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Add
the water, split peas, and salt, and bring the mixture to a boil.
Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes longer. Add the
green peas and simmer, covered, until both the split peas and green
peas are tender, about 5 minutes. In a food processor or an electric
blender, puree the soup, working in batches if necessary, for 20
seconds. Return the soup to the saucepan and stir in the milk. Cover,
set over moderate heat, and bring to serving temperature, 3 to 5
minutes. Adjust the salt and sprinkle with the cheese.

Downtown Black Bean Soup

beans, soups

2  and 1/2 quarts water or vegetable s; tock and stir into it
2 cup black beans and 2 bay leaves.

Bring to a boil

Turn down the heat and let simmer a couple of hours until the beans
start to get tender, then heat 1/4 to 3/4 cup olive oil (how much
will your conscience allow?) and cook in it until tender but not
browned

3 onions, chopped 2 green peppers, chopped 1 fresh jalepeno pepper,
chopped (optional) 4 to 6 cloves of garlic, pressed 1 to 3 teaspoons
salt, maybe more (taste it)

Stir this mixture into the simmering black beans and let cook until
quite tender and flavorful. More salt may be needed, and if you have
a chance to let the soup sit overnight at this point, it will be even
better. If desired, puree half or all of this to smoothness; we like
it half-pureed, half-chunky. If you do puree it, be sure to reheat it
before serving it, either as is or Cuban-style: bowls of steaming hot
white rice and dishes of chopped raw onions are on the table, and
each person stirs as much or as little rice and onions as they wish
into their soup.

Dried Tomato Soup

soups

2 tablespoon olive oil
4  garlic cloves, large
2 small onions, sliced
1 teaspoon basil, dried
1 teaspoon oregano, dried
1/2 teaspoon rosemary, dried
1/4 teaspoon ginger
12  dried tomato slices, 4in
1  diameter
6 cup water
1 pinch salt

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan on a medium heat. Slice the garlic
in fairly large pieces and add to the oil, add the sliced tomatoes.
Saute on mediun heat until soft. Add the herbs and ginger. Saute for
a minute or 2 longer. Add a little water if it gets to dry. Add
enough hot water to fill the pot, 4-6 cups worth. Cover, bring to a
boil, reduce to a simmer. Keep covered stirring occasionally to
prevent sticking. Taste and add a little pinch of salt if you think
it's needed 10 minutes or so before serving. I left this simmering
for about 3 hours. I imagine it would be ready anywhere after about
half an hour.

This made a lovely brothy tomato soup.

All the herbs were whole dried. I crumbled them into the pot as the
onion and garlic were cooking. All the ingredients except for the
garlic, olive oil, ginger and water were homegrown and dried. Don't
know if this will taste as good with store bought stuff. The dried
tomatoes had no seasoning or oil on them.

Drunken Beans

beans, soups

1/2 lb bacon-chopped
1 large white onion-chopped
1 tablespoon dried oregano -- the mexican
1  kind if
1  possible
1  clove garlic -- chopped
1  fine
2 cup dried pinto beans -- picked
1  over, soaked
1  in cold water at least 4
1  hours and up to 12
1  and drained
5 1/2 quart water plus additional if
1  necessary
1/2 cup sliced pickled jalapeno
1  chiles
12 oz dark mexican beer -- such as
1  negra modelo or dos equis
2 teaspoon salt - plus 1/2 more if
1  necessary

Preheat oven to 300 F. In a 6- to 7-quart ovenproof kettle cook bacon,
onion, oregano, and garlic over moderately high heat, stirring and
scraping up brown bits, until onion is browned lightly. Add beans,
water, jalapenos, and beer and bring to a boil. Bake mixture,
covered, in middle of oven until beans are soft, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
(Add additional water if beans begin to dry out. Mixture should be
soupy with beans very soft but not falling apart.) Stir in 2
teaspoons salt and bake beans 10 minutes more. Check seasoning,
adding remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt if necessary. Beans may be made 2
days ahead, cooled, uncovered, and chilled, covered. Typos by Brenda
Adams <adamsfmle@aol.com>

This dish is an excellent accompaniment to almost any Mexican meal.
The beans should be whole, perfectly tender and swimming in a
generous amount of broth. Source: Gourmet, July 1996

Dry Cream Soup Mix

diabetic, low fat, newspaper, soups

1 cup nonfat dry powdered milk
1 tablespoon dried onion flakes
2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoon chicken bouillon powder
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Mix all the ingredients together.  Keep this calorie-saving mixture
in an airtight container until you are ready to make a cream soup.
The base can be used to make any flavor you want just by adding the
main flavoring ingredient. For cream of mushroom soup, you would add
fresh or canned mushrooms; for cream of celery soup, add some fresh,
chopped celery, etc. Just add 2 cups of cold water to the magic
mixture and put into a large saucepan.  Over medium heat, cook the
mixture, stirring constantly, until thickened.  Add the main
ingredient and heat for a few more minutes. If it's a little too
thick, just add water to thin it or if it's too thin, add a
tablespoon or two of dry milk powder.

Ducklings Swimming In A Pond

chinese, seafood, soups

6 cup rich chicken broth
1/2 cup shelled green peas (or quartered sn; owpeas)
12  shelled baby shrimp
4  nami black mushrooms
3  egg whites
1  yellow food coloring

Even mature adults - gourmets no less - "oo" and "ah" when presented
with this simple-to-prepare soup.

Preparation:  Wash & soak mushrooms in warm water for 1 hour; slice
into thin strips; reserve.  Blanch shrimp in salted boiling water
(omit if shrimp are precooked).

Make ducklings within hour or less of serving.  Have steamer ready.

Work with eggs & mixing bowl at room temperature. Separate whites &
yolks; reserve yolks for another recipe. Beat egg whites, starting
slowly, then progressively faster after eggs begin to foam, until
eggs are stiff but not runny. If whites are too stiff, they tend to
break apart in shaping process.

Form 2 ducklings per serving.  Use tablespoon to form body; flatten
egg in spoon; turn over onto steaming plate. To body, add blob of egg
for neck & head, another piece for tail. Use toothpick to carefully
shape head & tail.

Steam one as test. Steaming should take 30-60 seconds to set surface
of egg. After steaming, swab beak & tail with yellow food coloring;
put color on toothpick to mark eyes.

Soup:  30 minutes or so before serving, heat broth to just under
boil; add mushrooms & peas.  5 minutes before serving, add shrimp &
desired seasonings.  Pour soup into warm serving bowl. Float
ducklings on soup. Serve.

Egg Drop Soup #7

chinese, soups

1 1/2 quart chicken broth, or clear soup stock
2 tablespoon cornstarch, mixed in 1/4 cup cold w; ater
2  eggs, slightly beaten with a fork
2  scallions, chopped, including green; ends.

Here's one from Jim Lee's Chinese Cook Book (My favorite). He says
that the secret of good soup is good soup stock. To keep the egg
flakes afloat, the soup must be thickened with cornstarch first
before the beaten eggs are stirred in. Bring soup stock to a boil.
Slowly pour in the cornstarch mixture while stirring the stock, until
the stock thickens. Reduce heat so stock just simmers.  Pour in the
eggs slowly while stirring the soup. As soon as the last bit of egg
is in, shut off heat at once. Serve with chopped scallions on top.
SUBSTITUTIONS AND VARIATIONS: TOMATO EGG-DROP SOUP is just a
variation of plain egg-drop soup. The added tartness of tomatoes
gives this soup an extra "zing" and helps to pick up sagging
appetites. The addition of 1 medium-size can of stewed tomatoes is
all that is needed. Bring stock to a boil. Add the tomatoes. (Mash
the tomatoes if the pieces are too large.) When soup boils again, add
the cornstarch mixture as before. Add the eggs while stirring. Shut
off heat at once and serve topped with the chopped scallions.

Elegant Chestnut Soup

appetizers, soups, vegetarian

3 cup chestnuts, roasted & peeled
1 tablespoon oil
1/2 cup onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup celery, chopped
2 1/4 cup water
3/4 cup apple juice
1 teaspoon tamari
1  vegetable bouillon cube
      ----OPTIONAL----
1 dash nutmeg

* To roast chestnuts: Choose fresh, firm, unwrinkled chestnuts with no
signs of mold. On the flat side of each chestnut make 2 cuts with a
small, sharp knife, from one end to the other in the shape of an X.
Place the chestnuts, cut side up, on a low baking sheet with a thin
layer of water on the bottom. Bake the chestnuts for 20-25 minutes at
350F until browned and the cuts peel back naturally from the heat.
Test one chestnut to be sure its "meat" is tender. When tender,
remove from oven, cool only slightly, peel and enjoy or use in
recipes. Some people like to boil the cut chestnuts for easier
peeling. This is okay, though some nutrients and flavour will be lost.

Prepare chestnuts. Peel off the outer shell and the fuzzy skin before
using the inner chestnut meat.

Heat the oil until hot and saute the onion until semi-tender. Add the
celery and saute until both are very tender. Blend the water and apple
juice with the chestnuts and all the remaining ingredients*. Simmer
everything on low to medium heat (do NOT boil!) for about 15-20
minutes or until hot throughout and the flavours mingle. Enjoy this
rich and tantalizing soup with extra chopped or ground nuts as a
garnish.

Keeps 4-6 days refrigerated.

*Two vegetable bouillon cubes may be used instead of the tamari or
miso. Also, 1/2 cup applesauce and 2 1/2 cups water can be used
instead of the juice and 2 1/4 cups water. *Anne's note: I would
assume by reading this, she means blend these ingredients in a
blender and return to the pot.

3 tablespoon olive oil
4 oz salt pork
4 oz peeled, chopped onions
1/2  stewing chicken, bite-sized pieces

1/2 lb potatoes
1 medium leek
5 oz carrots

3 oz pasta, medium or large

(NOTE:  Oz measurements are by weight.) Make a good broth with the
water, veal and ham bones, simmering slowly. When nearly done, add
salt to taste and the saffron. Blanch the salt pork to remove the
excess salt, then dice. Heat the oil in a large skillet, add the
diced salt pork and chopped onions. When the onions begin to brown,
add the pieces of chicken and veal and allow to cook slowly. Peel the
potatoes, leek and carrots, chop them fairly finely, then add to the
skillet with the chicken and veal. Chop the cabbage finely and add to
the skillet. Give it all a good stir. Remove the bones from the broth
and discard. Empty the contents of the skillet into the broth, then
add the beans, rice and pasta. Cook for about 10 - 15 minutes, until
the rice and pasta are done, then serve very hot.

Fakes Xithati ( Sour Lentil Soup)

greek

1/2 liter brown lentils
2 liter water
1/4 liter finely chopped spring onions
1  garlic clove (opt.); crushed
1/2 deciliter finely chopped coriander *
3/4 deciliter olive oil
1/2 deciliter cold water
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 deciliter vinegar (or to taste)
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper

*Note: Finely chopped parsley may be substituted for coriander leaves.

Wash lentils in several changes of cold water, or place in a sieve
and run water through them.  Drain.

Put lentils in a large pot with 8 cups water, spring onion, garlic if
used, oil and coriander or parsley (or a combination of the two if
preferred). Bring to the boil, cover pan and simmer on low heat for 1
hour or until lentils are soft.

Put water and flour in a screw top jar, seal and shake until
thoroughly combined.  This prevents lumps forming.  Pour this
gradually into boiling soup, stirring constantly, until thickened
slightly.  Add vinegar and salt and pepper to taste.  Return to the
boil, boil gently for 5 minutes, then serve hot.

olive oil over each serving.  Garnish with sprigs of fresh marjoram.

Faux-Fresh Tomato Soup

low cal, soups

1  from: gaye levy
1  onion; medium, chopped
1  carrot; large, chopped
4 cup chicken broth; reg strength
1 can tomato puree; 15 oz.
3 tablespoon basil leaves; dried
3/4 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
2 teaspoon vegetable oil; optional

Spray the bottom of a 3 to 4 quart pan with PAM, or optionally, coat
with oil. Add the onion and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally,
until both the onion and the carrot are sweet tasting and tender when
pierced. This will take about 30 minutes. Stir broth, tomato
puree, basil sugar and pepper into pan. Bring to a boil on high heat.
Cover and simmer to blend flavors, about 15 minutes.  With a
slotted spoon, scoop vegetables and a little of the broth into a food
processor or blender. Whirl until smoothly pureed. Pour vegetable
mixture back into the pan; heat until steaming. Ladle into bowls and
enjoy.

Notes from Gaye: This recipe is adapted from Sunset
Magazine, circa 1987. What could be more filling (and warming) this
time of year than a large bowl of soup and some fresh bread? For the
bread, try the Italian Bread which is as lo-cal as bread can go...and
go easy on the butter or margarine.

Fire Stew

soup/stew, spices

2 1/2 lb sugar-cured ham
6 oz dr. schnitzel's hot sauce
4 oz scotch bonnet pepper sauce
1 lb lentils
1 lb kidney beans
4 oz tabasco sauce
1  water

Put the ham, lentils and beans in enough water to cover. Cook until
beans are done.  Put in all hot sauces. Cook several more hours,
until the flavor is all through the ham, which is thoroughly broken
apart.

Serve with something cold to drink.  It's great for your sinuses.
I just threw this together because I was feeling reckless, but the
taste was wonderful, and the stuff freezes well, too. Both Dr.
Schnitzel's and the Scotch Bonnet pepper sauce are haba¤ero sauces,
which I think accounts for the wonderful flavor (as well as the
heat.) Tabasco alone would work, if you used a *lot*, but the flavor
wouldn't be as good, I think.

Happy sweating!

Fish Broth With Oysters & Saffron

seafood, soups

1/4 cup butter, unsalted
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 1/2  carrots ***
3  celery ***
2 small leeks ***
6  parsley stems
2  garlic, cloves, crushed, - peeled
2  bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon juniper, berries
1 large tomato, cut into wedges
3 lb bones, fish, and trimmings
1 cup wine, white, dry
6 cup water, cold (approximately)
1/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
4  clams
8  oysters, shucked
1 oz mung bean threads **
8  radicchio leaves
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads

** Soak the mung bean threads (also called cellophane noodles)
in hot water for twenty minutes. Drain, and cut into 2-inch lengths.
Set aside.

*** Split the carrots, celery and leeks lengthwise in half.
Clean, peel, and slice the vegetables into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

Melt the butter in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the
onions, carrots, leeks, parsley, garlic, bay leaves and juniper
berries, tossing the mixture well to coat with butter. When the
vegetables begin to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium low and cover.
Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Add the tomato to the stockpot and stir for 1 minute. Add the
fish bones and trimmings and white wine. Cook this mixture for 5
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add cold water to cover and raise
heat to medium high.  Bring to a boil, skimming all of the froth from
the surface as it forms.  Immediately lower heat and simmer gently,
uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes.  Strain the mixture, pressing the
solids firmly to extract all liquid.  Discard the solids. Add salt to
taste.

Heat 4 cups fish broth in a saucepan.  Steam clams separately in
small amount of broth just until shells open, removing each shell as
it opens. Transfer to 4 warm soup bowls; strain clam broth into warm
fish broth, avoiding any grit at the bottom.

Add oysters to fish broth and cook gently over low heat,
uncovered, just until edges curl, about 1 minute. Place 2 oysters in
each bowl. Ladle warm broth into bowls and add 2 tablespoons mung
bean threads. Add radicchio leaves and saffron and serve.

masterchefs, new york, seafood

1/4 cup butter, unsalted
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 each carrots, peeled
3 each celery, stalks, trimmed
2 small leeks
6 each parsley stems
2 each garlic, cloves, crushed, - peeled
2 each bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon juniper, berries
1 large tomato, cut into wedges
3 lb bones, fish, and trimmings
1 cup wine, white, dry
6 cup water, cold
1/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
4 each clams
8 each oysters, shucked
1 oz mung bean threads
8 each radicchio leaves
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads

:    Soak the mung bean threads (also called cellophane noodles) in
hot water for twenty minutes.  Drain, and cut into 2-inch lengths.
Set aside.

:    Split the carrots and leeks lengthwise in half.  Peel the
carrots, clean the carrots and the leeks, then slice them into
1/2-inch slices.

:    Melt the butter in a stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add the
onions, carrots, leeks, parsley, garlic, bay leaves and juniper
berries, tossing the mixture well to coat with butter.  When the
vegetables begin to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium low and cover.
Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.

:    Add the tomato to the stockpot and stir for 1 minute.  Add the
fish bones and trimmings and white wine.  Cook this mixture for 5
minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add cold water to cover and raise
heat to medium high.  Bring to a boil, skimming all of the froth from
the surface as it forms.  Immediately lower heat and simmer gently,
uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes.  Strain the mixture, pressing the
solids firmly to extract all liquid.  Discard the solids. Add salt to
taste.

:    Heat 4 cups fish broth in a saucepan.  Steam clams separately in
small amount of broth just until shells open, removing each shell as
it opens. Transfer to 4 warm soup bowls; strain clam broth into warm
fish broth, avoiding any grit at the bottom.

:    Add oysters to fish broth and cook gently over low heat,
uncovered, just until edges curl, about 1 minute.  Place 2 oysters in
each bowl. Ladle warm broth into bowls and add 2 tablespoons mung
bean threads. Add radicchio leaves and saffron and serve.

1 lb fresh or frozen haddock*
2 tablespoon olive or corn oil
1 medium onion; chopped
2  carrots; finely chopped
1  celery stalk plus leaves - finely c; hopped
2  garlic cloves; peeled - finely chopped
28 oz can italian plum tomatoes - undrain; ed
1/2 cup fish or vegetable stock or
1/2 cup bottled clam juice
1/2 cup dry white wine
1  garlic oil**
1 cup garlic croutons**
      ----BOUQUET GARNI----
1  bay leaf
2  thyme sprigs
1  strip of lemon peel
1 large sprig of fennel fronds
4  black peppercorns
      ----GARNISH----
1  chopped fresh fennel or
1  chopped fresh parsley

*Or perch or cod.

**To make the garlic croutons, cut crusts from thick, day-old bread.
Cut bread into large cubes.  Spread a cookie sheet with garlic oil -
either oil in which whole garlic cloves have been steeped, or oil
that has been heated gently with a cut garlic clove, pressing on
clove to release oils. Toss croutons in the garlic oil, then bake at
400 F., turning often, 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown.

If frozen, unwrap fish and allow to stand at room temperature for 15
to 20 minutes, or until soft enough to cut. With a sharp knife, cut
into 2" cubes.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan.  Add prepared onions,
carrots and celery and saute, stirring, 3 to 5 minutes over medium
heat. Add garlic and saute another 1 or 2 minutes. Add tomatoes (and
their juices), stock and wine.  Tie bouquet garni spices in a
cheesecloth bag and attach with string to pot handle for easy
removal. Place in tomato-wine mixture and let come to a boil,
uncovered.  Boil 5 to 10 minutes, then reduce heat to low.  Add fish
cubes and cover pot. Simmer 15 minutes or until fish flakes easily
with a fork.

Serve on top of garlic croutons in heated bowls, garnished with
chopped fennel or parsley.

Yield: 4 to 5 servings.

Flaedle

german, soup/stew, pancakes

200 gm flour (1 3/4 cups)
2  eggs
1/4 liter milk (1 cup plus 1 tbsp)
1 pinch salt
1  fat for frying

Mix the flour and milk, then add the eggs, and season with salt. In a
skillet, melt a little fat over medium heat. As soon as the fat is
hot, hold the skillet at a slight angle and pour in the batter in
such a manner that the whole bottom of the skillet is covered with a
thin layer. As soon as the bottom of the pancake develops yellow
spots, carefully loosen the edges with an eggturner, then flip the
pancake to cook the other side. Once the 'Flaedle' is done, set it
aside for cooling.

If the 'Flaedle' is to be used in 'Flaedle'-soup, roll it up and cut
it into very thin slices.  Put into hot broth, and adjust seasoning
to taste, with nutmeg, chopped parsley or chives, etc.

Serves 4.

heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned,

2 tablespoon olive oil
4 lb yellow onions, cut in half lengthwi; se thinly sliced
2 teaspoon sugar
1  salt
750 ml white wine
4 cup chicken broth
1  cinnamon stick
4 cup stale italian or french bread, torn
1  parmesan cheese, grated

In a Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onions
and toss to coat with the oil. Cover tightly, reduce the heat to
medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are
soft an just beginning to color (30 minutes).

Remove the cover, increase the heat to medium, and cook, stirring

sugar and a little salt. Cook, stirring frequently until the sugar
melts and the onions are caramelized (5 more minutes). Add the wine,

occasionally.

Add the bread to the simmering soup and continue cooking until the
bread disintegrates, 30 to 45 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent

Fluffy Matzo Balls

jewish, soups

2  eggs
2 tablespoon chicken fat; or vegetable oil
1/2 cup matzo meal salt
1 1/2 teaspoon dill, fresh; chopped
2 tablespoon chicken soup; or water

"Daliah Organ says that secret to making them fluffy is refrigerating
the for at least 2 hours before shaping them, then cooking them for 1
hour. Her whole family loves them, except Johnny,who likes matzo
balls hard. For him, she removes a few after 1/2 hour of cooking.
Dalian flavors them differently, according to her mood. Instead of
the dill, she sometimes uses 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of sugar
and sometimes uses ground green cardamom seeds. As it has more
flavor, Daliah likes to use chicken fat rather than vegetable oil.
She prefer Streit's matzo meal. The water that she cooks the matzo
balls in is always well seasoned. She serves at least 2 per person."
Combine eggs with chicken fat or oil. In another bowl, combine matzo
meal, salt and dill. Stir 2 mixtures together, Add chicken soup or
water. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. Shape mixture (it
should be like dough) into golf-ball sized balls, moistening hands
with water to prevent sticking. Drop balls into large pot of boiling
water seasoned with salt and pepper. (The more matzo balls you are
cooking the larger the pot should be.) Reduce heat, cover and simmer
1 hour. After cooking, matzo balls should be the size of meatballs.
Remove matzo balls from water and place in chicken soup to absorb
flavor. MAKES: 4-6 SERVINGS

Four-Day Vegetable Soup By James Beard~ Chef

soups, vegetables, vegetarian

1 large onion; peeled; fine chopped
3 each garlic cloves; peeled and finely chopped
2 cup cabbage; cooked and finely chopped
2 each carrots; peeled; shredded
1 small turnip; peeled; fine diced
1 each mushrooms; chopped
4 each swiss chard leaves & stems
2 small zucchini; finely diced
4 each rosemary leaves; fresh, or
1 teaspoon rosemary; dried; crushed
1 medium tomato; peeled; seeded and choppe
1 tablespoon salt; to taste
1 teaspoon pepper, black; ground fresh to taste

Put all the vegetables and the rosemary in a deep pan. Cover with
water and add salt and pepper to taste -- about 1 tblspn salt and 1
tspn pepper. Bring to a boil gradually over low heat. Cover pot and
simmer the soup gently for 1-1/2 to 2 hours, or until all the flavors
are well blended. Taste and correct the seasoning. Serve with
crackers, cheese, or whatever you'd like. * Examples of variations *
First day: Enough soup for four people. Serve as described above.
Second day: Add to the remainder another couple of peeled and chopped
tomatoes, a few leaves of finely chopped spinach, another zucchini,
and a few leftover cooked chickpeas. Add a bit of grated lemon rind
and a touch of onion about 10 minutes before serving. Third day: For
lunch, the soup is good cold with a dollop of creme frai'che. Fourth
day: Add 2 or 3 peeled and diced beets, another cup of finely
chopped, cooked cabbage, 3 or 4 more mushrooms, and if any, a little
left over vegetable broth cooked from another day. NOTE: Of course,
if you have some chicken or vegetable broth you can add it to the
soup. The secret is to have variations of color, texture and flavor.

Fran's Potato/Cheese/Corn Chowder

crockpot, main dish

2 tablespoon butter or margarine
5 lb potatoes 1 lb grated; 4 lbs diced
3/4 cup celery; diced
1 cup carrots; diced
1 medium onion; minced
2 lb grated cheese
3 can creamed corn
2 can whole corn (or frozen)
1 lb sliced sausage
1 quart chicken stock
1 cup powdered milk not mixed up
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon seasoned salt
2 teaspoon basil

This recipe is an adaptation of several of the potatoe chowder
recipes that Lawrence Kellie posted a while back.  Some of the the
ingredients also came from the top of my head.  It turned out VERY
well, though it does look a little odd.  My husband LOVES it.  I
finally came up with my idea of what Corn/potato chowder should be.
My 3-1/2 year old son's (vegetable hater) only comment as he shoveled
it down was "yummy". I will definately be making this one again.  I
am glad I wrote the changes down this time, I usually don't.

This can either be cooked as direced in the recipe, or for about 10
hours in the crock pot, on HI, adding the milk powder and cheese at
the end.

:          In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat.   Saute
onion and celery until softened but not brown.
:          Add potatoes, Chicken broth, S&P, basil and carrots.
Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes until potatoes
are just tender.
:          Brown sliced sausage pieces in a fry pan, add to chowder.
Add cream of mushroom soup and corn.  Simmer until potatoes and
carrots are done to your desired level of mushiness ( I like em mushy
in my chowder).
:          Add grated cheese and milk powder.  If the chowder is too
thin, you can remove some of it and put throught the blender to
thicken, if it is too thick, add water.  Adjust seasonings if desired.
:          Serve with bread or crackers.

French Onion Soup - Jarlsberg

cheese, french, wines

1/4 cup butter, light
1 tablespoon fructose
1 cup wine, white zinfandel
1/2 teaspoon pepper, ground, fresh
8 oz jarlsberg cheese, sliced
1  paprika
4 large onions, spanish or
8 medium onions, vidalia
1 tablespoon flour
3 can beef broth
1  bread, french, dried
1 cup parmesan cheese, grated
1 cup swiss cheese, grated

In a large, heavy dutch oven melt the light butter slowly.  When
melted, add the sliced onions, and fructose (normal table sugar may
be used if desired.)  Cover, and cook - stirring often - until the
onions are tender but colorless.

Take the top off the pan, turn the heat up to high - then cook
the onions until the sugar caramalizes on them turning them a golden
caramel color.

Stir in the flour and make a roux.  Blend well and cook over
medium heat for three minutes until the starchy flavor of the flour
is cooked out.

Carefully add the wine and pepper to the onions with stirring
over high heat until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens.

Pour in the beef broth and bring to a boil.  When the soup
begins to boil, cover, reduce heat - and simmer for twenty minutes so
the flavors have time to blend.

To prepare for table, ladle the soup into small fire proof
crocks or broiler safe bowls.  Float slices of dried French bread in
the bowls then add a 1/4 c of each of the grated cheeses topping it
all off with a slice of Jarlsberg cheese. Let the slices overlap the
sides of the bowl slightly the toasted cheese that runs over the side
is a delicacy for most french onion soup lovers!

Place the crocks under your broiler and watch carefully as the
cheese on top melts, bubbles and begins to turn a rich dark brown on
top of the bubbles.

When you see the bubbles browing - your done.  Enjoy!

Fresh Tomato Soup Ala Terri

cyberealm

12 lb very ripe fresh tomatoes
16 tablespoon sweet butter
4 tablespoon olive oil
4  onion, finely minced
12 tablespoon flour
16 cup boiling water
4  bouquet garni*
1  salt & freshly ground white pepper
24 tablespoon sour cream
8 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill
      ----OPTIONAL----
8 cup cooked rice
4 cup chicken stock

* Bouquet Garni - In a piece of cheesecloth, tie the following: 3 to 4
sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 t dry
thyme and 1 t fresh marjoram.  Leave the string long enough to hang
the garni in the pot and tie the string to the pot handle for easy
removal. Drop the tomatoes into boiling water for 1 minute.  Drain
and peel. Chop coarsely and reserve.  In a large saucepan, heat 1 T
of butter and oil. Add the onion and cook over low heat until lightly
browned. Add the remaining butter.  When the butter is melted, add
the flour and cook until it is golden brown.  Be careful not to burn
it! Add the chopped tomatoes stirring constantly.  Then add the
boiling water, Bouquet Garni, salt and pepper. Cover and simmer the
soup for 35 minutes. Remove the soup from the heat. Remove the
Bouquet. Cool the soup and puree it in the blender. If it seems too
thick, thin it out with a little chicken stock or water. Serve the
soup in individual bowls, each topped with 1 T sour cream and a
sprinkling of dill. Notes: For a hearty soup, omit the sour cream and
substitute cooked rice.  From "Seasonal Kitchen, a Celebration of
Fresh Foods" by Perla Meyers.

1 can (8 ounce) water chestnuts
1 lb finely ground lean pork
4 1/2 teaspoon peeled and minced fresh ginger
1  ground white pepper, to taste
1 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
2 1/8 teaspoon cornstarch

      ----SOUP----
5 cup vegetable stock
5 cup chicken stock
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper

Meatballs: Finely chop 12 of the water chestnuts. Reserve the
remaining ones for garnish. Combine the pork, ginger, chopped water
chestnuts, soy sauce, cornstarch, salt and pepper. Mix well and form
into balls 3/4 inch in diameter. These may be made in advance and

minutes prior to serving, return stock to a boil and add the
meatballs. Cook 10-15 minutes (Note: Meatballs will be slightly pink
in the center even after the second cooking.) Season with salt and
black pepper to taste. Turn heat to medium low. Add the watercress
and green onions. Cook, uncovered, for a few minutes until watercress
is slightly wilted and bright green in color. Add the remaining water

1/2 lb carrots
2 each large leeks
1/2 oz flour
1 each small swede (turnip)
1 lb potatoes
1 oz parsley
1 single salt and pepper

Put the meat into the saucepan, cover with cold water, add salt and
pepper, bring slowly to the boil and skin carefully.  (This can be
done the night before and the fat allowed to set on the surface.
This makes it easier to skim off.)

Then add the carrots (cut in half), the swede (sliced) and the white
of the leeks, and simmer gently for 2 - 2 1/2 hours. Add the potatoes
(cut in four) and continue to simmer for another 30 minutes.

When the potatoes are almost cooked, thicken with flour and a little
water.

Lastly, add the green of the leeks and parsley (chopped) and simmer
for further 10 minutes and serve in basins while hot.

Cawl was the dish most commonly served for dinner on the farm during
the winter months in th ecounties of South and West Wales.

The broth itself would be served in basins or bowls, with bread, and
the meat and vegetables served as a second course.

Gravy Soup

soup/stew

6 tablespoon chicken fat; or butter
6 tablespoon flour
5 cup chicken stock
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  croutons
4 tablespoon gruyere cheese; grated

Melt the chicken fat in a large saucepan over low heat. Add the flour,
blend well and cook until the flour is lightly browned, stirring
occasionally with a wooden spoon. Gradually stir in the stock and
continue stirring until it boils. Lower the heat and simmer, covered,
about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Season the soup with salt and pepper and pour it into 5 heated bowls.
Top them with croutons, sprinkle with the cheese, and serve.

This is a good winter soup, and is a specialty of the Basel area in
Switzerland.  Although this version is made with chicken fat and
stock, it can also be made with ham or bacon fat and ham stock. If
you decide to do that, though, take it easy on adding salt.

1/2 cup raw long grain white rice
2  whole eggs or egg yolks
2  lemons; (juice only) salt

Bring the broth to a full boil in a soup kettle. Gradually add the

egg-lemon mixture, beating steadily. Stir the mixture into the soup
and cook over minimum heat, without boiling, until the soup thickens
to coat a spoon.  Taste for salt, and keep warm over hot water until
ready to serve. Pass the pepper mill at the table for additional zest.
(If desired, bite-sized pieces of cooked chicken may be added to
soup before adding the rice).

Green Shrimp Soup

seafood, soups

1 medium onion
1 large carrot (about 5 oz)
1 1/2 teaspoon butter
3 cup meat broth, hot
1 tablespoon savory (fresh, chopped fine)
1 teaspoon tarragon (fresh, chopped fine)
1 lb peas (cooked in lightly salted wate; r)
5 oz shrimp (deveined, cooked and cut in; to small pieces)
1/2 cup white wine, dry
2 tablespoon cream
1 cup champagne (demi sec)

Chop the onion and carrot finely.  Heat the butter in a pan and fry
the vegetables for 5 minutes stirring continuously. Add the hot meat
broth. Boil for 10 minutes.

Add savory, tarragon and peas.  Bring to a boil and let cook for 8
minutes. Strain the soup and put it back into the pan.

Add shrimp.  Simmer 5 minutes on medium heat.  (Be sure the soup is
not boiling.)  Add white wine and cream. Take from the heat. Season if
necessary.  Add champagne and serve immediately.

NOTES:

*  Fine pea soup with shrimp and champagne -- This is a recipe out of
a German low-calorie cookbook. It is a simple recipe for a really
delicate soup. It can be served as a festive appetizer or as a
gourmet snack.

*  The fresh spices can be substituted by dried spices.

*  If you use canned shrimp, never let them boil. They would become
tough and lose their delicate taste.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  40 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

spices, makes a great first course or light meal for those crisply
beautiful autumn days. In fact, you may want to make it throughout the
growing season, serving it chilled during summer's hottest days.

Gulyas Saturday Night

hungarian, soups

3 tablespoon bacon grease
1  green chile; (opt, julienne)
2 large onion; chopped
2  garlic clove; smashed & chopped
1 tablespoon paprika, hungarian
3/4 lb flank steak; cubed
3/4 lb pork; cubed
2 cup tomato; canned
1  pepper, black
1  garlic salt; to taste
1  sour cream; for garnish

In large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, saut peppers & onions in the
bacon drippings until onions are translucent. Make a space, and add
garlic directly to the hot surface, stirring until fragrant. Now add
the paprika and stir it all until it loses its raw smell. Add cubed
meats, canned tomatoes and a hefty grinding of pepper and stir. When
mixture reaches a simmer, cover and allow to cook for 1 to 1-1/2
hours, until meat is tender. Check after 45 minutes; if there seems
to be too much liquid, leave cover off to reduce sauce. And if, when
the meat is tender, there is still too much sauce, thicken it in the
following manner: remove a cup or so of liquid and stir into it
perhaps a teaspoon of arrowroot; return all to pan and stir until
thickened nicely. Serve on noodles if you like, although they're not
absolutely necessary. Suggestion: serve WITH fresh, steamed green
beans, left whole.

Haddock Chowder

soups

3 1/2 lb haddock
1/3 lb salt pork
2  medium onions, chopped
2 cup pared, diced potatoes
1 quart whole milk
1 can evaporated milk

HADDOCK CHOWDER From America:

Have the haddock cleaned and cut up to boil.  Barely cover with salted
water and cook until the fish comes off the bones. Don't cook until
the flesh is soft and mushy. Set aside to cool.

While fish is cooling, cut the pork into 1/4" cubes and fry until
crisp in a large heavy kettle. Drain the cubes on paper towels and
pour off all but 4 tbls of the fat. In this fat, cook the chopped
onions over low heat until trnasparent.  Add the potatoes and enough
of the fish liquor to cover them. Simmer gently until potatoes are
cooked.

Pick the fish flakes from the bones, adding to the chowder mixture
when the potatoes are done.  Add quart of milk and evaporated milk.
Set aside until serving time.

It imporves the flavor of the chowder greatly to let it stand for
several hours before serving.  Be sure it is piping hot when bringing
it to the table.

Biscuits and pickles always go with a good chowder.

Hannah Storm's "Mystery" Soup

soups

1  onion,large,chopped
1 lb mushrooms,sliced
1  butter stick
1/3 cup flour
2 quart chicken broth
2 cup canned pumpkin*
2 cup light cream
3 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoon nutmeg

Before making her name as CNN's sole female sportscaster, Hannah
Storm was famous for her misadventures in the kitchen. "When I was
younger, my brothers used to make fun of me," says Storm. "Once, I
was following this wonderful chocolate-coffee bundt cake recipe, and
I used a cup of freeze-dried coffee grounds. The joke circulated
around the family for years, 'I ate a piece of Hannah's cake and was
up for two days straight'."

Storm has since honed her culinary skills. One dish she's mastered is
her mother's famous pumpkin soup. "This soup was always a mystery
soup for anyone outside of the family," says Storm. "My mother never
liked to tell people what was in it because they probably wouldn't
try it."

* - not pie filling

In a large soup pot, saute onion and mushrooms in butter for 1-2
minutes. Remove from heat and stir in flour. Add chicken broth and
pumpkin. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir
in cream, honey, nutmeg and serve.

OPTIONAL GARNISH: Sprinkle with croutons or crispy chinese noodles and
Parmesan cheese.

heavy pan and fry the meat with the leeks and garlic till the
vegetables are slightly softened and the meat lightly browned. Add
the barley, water, vinegar, bay leaves and seasoning. bring the pot
to the boil, cover it and simmer gently for 1 - 1 1/2 hours or till
the meat is really tender and ready to fall from the bone. Add the
sage and continue to cook for several minutes. Adjust the seasoning

Great chili to make with friends.  Makes about 16 cups. Substitute
2-1/2 to 3 cups each white and blanck beans, cooked. Use garbanzos
instead of navy or white kidney. You may want to add a 2nd bottle of
Ale to the Chili when it needs it. If you don't like eggplant, or
can't find it, use 2 zucchini. Need about 3 to 4 cups of diced
eggplant/zucchini. Ifyou want to make vegetarian chili, omit the
chicken.

1. Heat oil over low flame in a heavy-bottomed stockpot. Add onion,
garlic, and spices and cook, covered, until golden, about 15 minutes.

2. Add eggplant and cook, covered, for 15 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

3. Add beans, Harpoon ale, oregano, and tomatoes. Cook, covered, over
medium heat for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook for 2 to 3
hours (or less if using already cooked beans), partly covered, making
sure all beans are completely soft.

4. Add chicken and peppers and cook until just heated.

6. Serve with a dollop of (soft) goat cheese and fresh cilantro.

Healthy Liver Soup

soups

1/2 lb liver, chopped
2 tablespoon butter
4 small carrots, diced
1/2 cup celery, diced
1 large onion, thinly sliced
2 cup hot water
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup fresh or frozen spinach
20 oz can tomatoes

Salt and Pepper to taste

Stir cook the liver in butter.Add remaining ingredients.Stir well.
Cook covered (25 min in microwave).  This soup freezes and reheats
very well.

This will take some experimenting but I could make it at the same
time as a stir fry and freeze the soup in plastic ice cube trays
instead of freezing half the package of raw liver.

Have you tried it using a creamed soup?

I'm not all that fond of cooked tomatoes, but it looks like it might
be good using something like cream of Cheddar...

Also... were you using beef or chicken or what?

Also... how about some diced potatoes...?

OTOH...  Let's eliminate the butter and use bacon... Turns it into a
chowder...

Hearty Bean & Vegetable Stew

crockpot, low fat, ornish, stews, vegetarian

1 lb beans, assorted, dry
2 cup vegetable juice
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup apple or pineapple juice vegetable; stock or water
1/2 cup celery  diced
1/2 cup parsnips  diced
1/2 cup carrots  diced
1/2 cup mushrooms  diced
1  onion  diced
1 teaspoon basil, dried
1 teaspoon parsley, dried
1  bay leaf
3  clove garlic  minced
1 teaspoon black pepper  ground
1 cup rice or pasta  cooked

Sort and rinse beans, then soak overnight in water.

Drain beans and place in crockpot.  Add vegetable juice, wine, soy
sauce, and apple or pineapple juice.  Cover with vegetable stock or
water; the amount added depends on whether you prefer a soup (more
liquid) or a stew (less).  The juice adds just a tad of sweetness and
the soy sauce adds depth and the tang of salt.

Cook at high for 2 hours.  Add vegetables, herbs, and spices, and
cook for 5-6 hours at low until carrots and parsnips are tender.
When tender, add rice or pasta and cook for one additional hour.

Notes:

For beans use 3 or 4 kinds, such as: black, red kidney, pinto, baby
lima, lentil, and green and/or yellow split peas.

Most soups and stews can be prepared in a
crock pot.  Just decrease the liquid ingredients (not as much liquid
will evaporate from a closed slowcooker) and let it rip for 6 or more
hours.

1/4 cup drained canned plum tomatoes
2 1/2 tablespoon chopped onion
2  basil leaves
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
2 tablespoon olive oil
1  freshly ground black pepper
3 oz imported italian pasta

THE NIGHT BEFORE, pick over the beans, rinse them, and let them soak

into a large pot and cover with 4 cups water. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt,
bring to the boil and simmer, covered for 1-to-1 1/2 hours, until the

black pepper. Toss everything to coat it with the oil, then add 1/3
cup warm water. Cover and cook gently 20 minutes, until the

1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 lb smoked sausage - sliced 1/2 thick

1 medium onion, thinly sliced
3 medium potatoes, sliced
1 large bunch (abt. 1 lb.) kale - shredded; or - sliced very thinly
1  freshly ground black pepper

Heat oil in a skillet; saute the sausage just until the fat is
rendered, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and reserve.

Bring broth to a boil with the onions and potatoes; simmer 10 to 15
minutes until potatoes are very tender. Mash onions and potatoes in
the broth with a potato masher or slotted spoon. Add drained sausage

Hernekeitto

soups

1/2 lb dried whole green peas
2 quart cold water
1 lb pork leg
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 pinch dry mustard
1 dash salt
1 dash ground pepper

This Finnish pea soup can be made well in advance. You can double or
triple the recipe and freeze it in useful quantities. Malla
Karhusaari also suggests reducing the cooking time by using a
pressure cooker or microwave to prepare it. Rinse peas and soak in
cold water in large port for 8 hours or overnight. Bring peas and
soaking water to the boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for one hour
or until peas begin to soften. Add pork and continue to simmer for
two to three hours, until peas and meat ar thoroughly cooked. When
meat is tender, remove it from pot, discard skin and bone, cut meat
in cubes and return to soup. You may need to add more water to pot
for desired consistency. Season with marjoram, mustard, salt and
pepper. Heat to blend flavors and serve hot. Serves 6. From The

Hideg Szamocaleves (Cold Strawberry Soup)

hungarian, soups

1  text only

Just a faint memory up here what with our fading daylight but well
worth saving for next year.  This series includes recipes from
Europey, Turkey and one honest to goodness Ozzy recipe.

Cold fruit soups are popular in central Europe and this recipe for
strawberry soup from Hungary. Obviously it is not the sort of thing
one makes when strawberries are expensive, but at the peak of their
season it makes a good and unusual starter.

Hull 4 punnets [?] of strawberries into a large bowl (reserving about
6 to 10 strawberries, depending on their size, for decoration),
sprinkle generously with sugar and crush thoroughly with a fork.

Add 1 litre of liquid made up of the juice of half a lemon and a 50-
50 mix of red wine and water.  Taste and if necessary sweeten further
or add a little more lemon juice. Chill and decorate with sliced
reserved strawberries before serving, preferably in clear glass bowls.

Makes 3 servings.

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 large bunch fresh parsley
1 teaspoon ground cloves

puree, beating in with a whisk. Add the butter and whisk smooth.
Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium low heat for 3 minutes. Pour
hot into 12 hot pint jars, leaving 1/2 inch head space. Seal and
process in hot- water bath for 15 min.

To serve, add one 11 ounce can cream of mushroom soup and 1 soup can
of water to every pint of tomato soup base. Heat and serve

Hot & Sour Garlic Chive Soup With Tofu

soups

2 medium carrots -- sliced
1/4 cup fresh garlic chives --
1  minced
3  fresh lovage or celery
1  leaves
3  romaine lettuce or swiss
1  chard leaves -- torn into
1  pieces
4  dried cloud ear or shiitake
1  mushrooms
1  6 inch piece  dried arame,
1  dulse, or tombu seaweed
1  (package)
1 small fresh or dried hot red
1  pepper
2 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 quart water
1 cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon dark sesame oil
1/2 lb firm tofu -- cut into inch
1  pieces
2 tablespoon rice or barley miso sauce
1  garlic chive leaves -- for
1  garnish
1  garlic chive flowers -- for
1  garnish

In a large heavy pot, combine all the ingredients above the line.
Bring to a boil, then cover, lower the heat to medium-low, and simmer
for
30    minutes. Remove the mushrooms and slice thinly, discarding
the tough portions. Strain the broth and return it to the pan. Add
the tofu and mushrooms and simmer for 5 minutes. Dissolve the miso in
a small amount of the broth, stir it into the soup, then immediately
remove the pot from the heat. Garnish with minced garlic chive leaves
and serve at once.

Substitution for the Chinese garlic chives: 1 clove garlic and twice
as much volumn of fresh chives.

~ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : This recipe makes one Japanese Miso - a seawood and mushroom
flavored vegetable broth. Strain the broth and return mushrooms to
pot. Then add tofu, Chinese chives, and agar (a thickener made from
seaweed). Quick soup:  check the import section of the grocery. Buy 1
envelop (or box) Japanese Miso with Mushroom. Make according to
package directions. Taste and add red pepper flakes and a little rice
vinegar to taste. Add tofu and heat through. The packaged soup
contains the agar to thicken the broth.  Do add Chinese chive. (I've

Hot & Sour Mushroom Soup (Tom Yum Het)

soups, thai

1  stephen ceideburg
2 cup defatted reduced-sodium chicken sto; ck
1/2 lb oyster mushrooms, trimmed and halve; d
1/4 lb straw mushrooms, trimmed and halved
2  serrano chilies, with seeds, cut in; to thin strips
1  one-inch piece fresh lemon grass or; : *
2  fresh kaffir lime leaves or: **
3 tablespoon fresh lime juice
3 tablespoon fish sauce

* 1 Tbsp. dried, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes and drained ** 4
dried, soaked in warm water for 20 minutes, drained, or 1/2 tsp.
grated lime zest

This classic central That dish is traditionally made with shrimp or
chicken, but we prefer using oyster mushrooms since they are just as
meaty in texture and yet more subtle in taste. Although it is served
as a soup course in North American Thai restaurants, it actually
falls somewhere between a soup and a curry. In Thailand, it is served
as a condiment to rice, just like any of the other dishes on the
table.

In a medium-sized saucepan, bring stock to a boil and add mushrooms
and chilies. Tie lemon grass and lime leaves or zest together in a
cheesecloth bag and add to the stock mixture. Cook over medium heat
for about 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender. Reduce heat
to low and add lime juice and fish sauce. Discard the cheesecloth
bag. Serve the soup hot, accompanied by steamed rice.

Hot & Sour Soup (Chinese)

chinese, soups

3  dried black mushrooms
1  heaping tablespoon small tree ear m; ushrooms
20  dried lily buds
2  pads firm bean curd
1/4 lb lean pork, cut into matchstick shre; ds
2 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
5 tablespoon white vinegar
2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1/4 cup bamboo shoots, cut into matchstick; shreds
5 cup chicken stock
3 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup water
2  eggs lightly beaten
1 teaspoon white pepper
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 tablespoon chopped scallions
2 tablespoon chopped fresh coriander leaves

Here's a classic Chinese version.

Put the mushrooms, tree ears and lily buds into a bowl and cover with
boiling water.  Let stand for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the bean
curd into strips and set aside.

Combine the pork shreds with the dark soy sauce in a small bowl.

Combine the light soy sauce, vinegar and salt in another bowl. Remove
the black mushrooms from the soaking liquid, cut off the woody stems
and discard, then slice the caps thinly and put into a bowl. Drain
and rinse the tree ears and add them to the mushrooms. Remove the
lily buds, cut off the woody tips, slice them in two, then pull each
apart by hand into 2 or 3 shreds and add them to the mushrooms.

Heat the oil in a wok or large pot.  Stir-fry the pork just until it
changes color.  Add the tree ear mixture and bamboo shoots; cook,
stirring for 1 minute.  Add the stock and bring to a boil (you may
have this simmering in a separate pot), and stir in the vinegar
mixture.

Adjust the seasonings.

Cook for 1 minute then add the bean curd.  When boiling, give the
cornstarch/water mixture a stir to recombine and stir into the soup.
Cook until the soup thickens and clears slightly. Turn off the heat
and slowly swirl in the beaten eggs.  Transfer to a soup tureen,
sprinkle with the pepper, drizzle in the sesame oil, garnish with the
scallions and coriander and serve.

Hot Chili Beef & Onion Soup - Yukkai Jang K

soups, korean

1 lb braising beef
8 cup water
1 1/2 tablespoon hot chili powder
2 tablespoon sesame oil
12  green onions
2 teaspoon crushed garlic
1 tablespoon white sesame seeds, toasted  and gr; ound
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1 1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce

This chili-red soup is exceptionally hot.  It is said that the time to
serve it is in the hottest months, when the perspirationit induces
has a cooling effect on the diner. It is equally effective ammunition
against winter cold.

Cut the beef into cubes and place in a saucepan with the water. Bring
to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 1-1/2 to 2
hours until the meat is falling apart.

Mix the chili powder with the sesame oil.  Trim and shred the green
onions. Heat the chili powder and sesame oil in a pan and fry the
green onions with the garlic for 2 minutes. Add the sesame seeds,
sugar, pepper and soy sauce and fry for 2 to 3 minutes over medium
heat.

Lift out the meat, drain well and toss in the pan for a few minutes.
Return the contents of the pan to the stock and bring to a boil,
simmering until the soup is well flavored.

Hot Or Cold Leek Soup

soups, tabasco, vegetables

1  leek, (about 8 ounces) *
2 tablespoon olive oil
1  onion, (about 6 ounces),
1  peeled and sliced
6 cup chicken stock
1 1/2 lb potatoes, peeled and cut
1  into 2-inch cubes
1  salt to taste (depending on
1  saltiness of stock)
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1  bread croutons, for garnish
      ----FOR COLD SOUP----
2 1/2 cup cold milk
6 tablespoon chives, chopped
1/4 teaspoon tabasco sauce

Remove the root end and any damaged outer leaves from the leek, but
leave the remainder of the leaves intact. Split the leek in half
lengthwise, and cut it into 1/2-inch pieces. Clean the leek by
immersing the pieces in a bowl filled with cold water.  Lift the
pieces from the water and place them in a sieve to drain. Heat the
oil in a pot. When hot, add the leek and sliced onion, and cook over
medium heat for about 5 minutes, until they soften and begin to brown
lightly. Add the stock, potatoes, salt and pepper, and bring to the
boil. Boil for 30 to 40 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.
Strain off most of the cooking juices and reserve them. Add the
solids with a little of the juices to the bowl of a food processor,
and process briefly, just until pureed. (If too much liquid is added
to the processor bowl, the mixture will become too foamy.) Stir the
puree into the reserved juices. You should have about 7 cups. The hot
soup can be served immediately, either plain or with croutons. FOR
COLD SOUP: Cool the soup and stir in the milk, chives and Tabasco
sauce. Serve cold. Serves 6. *If you cannot find leeks, add
additional onions or scallions; the soup will be very good, although
it won't have the unique taste that leeks give to soup. If using
leeks or scallions, be sure to make use of the green as well as the
white part of the vegetables, after trimming them first, of course,
to eliminate any damaged or wilted sections. The green leaves lend
color as well as taste and texture to the soup. Recipe from "Cuisine
Economique" by Jacques Pepin. Source: Cuisine Economique - J. Pepin

Hot Red Snapper Soup (Korean Domi Chigae)

fish, soups, korean

1/4 lb lean beef (shoulder)
1 1/2 lb red snapper
2  scallions
2  cloves garlic
1/2  cake bean curd
2 cup water
2 tablespoon kochu chang

A chigae is usually a hot soup comprised of several ingredients. In
this case, meat has been cooked with fish, the one to impart body,
the other to add flavor. Kochu Chang is red bean paste, which may be
purchased at many Oriental food stores. If it is not available,
Japanese miso sauce may be substituted.

1.  Shred the beef into 2-inch lengths. Cut the red snapper across
the body into 1 1/2-inch widths, leaving the bones inside. Cut the
scallions into 2-inch cubes.

2.  Arrange the pieces of fish on the bottom of a pot. Add the
scallions, then the beef. Now add the garlic. Mix the kochu chang
with water and pour it over the other ingredients. Bring to a boil,
then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Just before serving
add the bean curd and cook for 3 minutes.

Variation: Instead of red snapper, use a 1 1/2 to 2-pound sea bass,
or a 1-pound codfish, or 2 small lobsters.

Hot-&-Sour Mushroom Soup (Tom Yum Het)

soups, thai

1  stephen ceideburg
2 cup defatted reduced-sodium chicken sto; ck
1/2 lb oyster mushrooms, trimmed and halve; d
1/4 lb straw mushrooms, trimmed and halved
2  serrano chilies, with seeds, cut in; to thin strips
1  one-inch piece fresh lemon grass or; : *
2  fresh kaffir lime leaves or: **
3 tablespoon fresh lime juice
3 tablespoon fish sauce

* 1 Tbsp. dried, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes and drained ** 4
dried, soaked in warm water for 20 minutes, drained, or 1/2 tsp.
grated lime zest

This classic central That dish is traditionally made with shrimp or
chicken, but we prefer using oyster mushrooms since they are just as
meaty in texture and yet more subtle in taste. Although it is served
as a soup course in North American Thai restaurants, it actually
falls somewhere between a soup and a curry. In Thailand, it is served
as a condiment to rice, just like any of the other dishes on the
table.

In a medium-sized saucepan, bring stock to a boil and add mushrooms

Hulled Corn Soup (Ai)

pork, side dish, soups, vegetables

4 quart dried indian corn kernels
3 lb salt pork
1 lb dry red kidney beans
1 quart hardwood ashes

Put enough water in an old kettle to cover the corn, Bring to a boil;
add corn and ashes. Cook about 20 minutes, stirring frequently. This
loosens the hulls or shells on the corn. When the hulls slip off the
kernels by working between the fingers, drain the water and rinse
corn in cold water, working corn with the fingers to help remove
hulls. Drain and parboil; drain, rinse and parboil again. Repeat
several times until the parboiled water looks clean and clear, (A
handmade basket is traditionally used for this purpose.)

When corn is good and clean, place it in a large kettle or canner with
clean water. Parboil washed beans separately until water is colored;
add both water and beans to the corn mixture. Cut salt pork into
small pieces; add to the corn and beans. Be sure to use plenty of
water because the corn will swell as it cooks. Cook 3 or 4 hours, or
until corn is tender, stirring occasionally and adding water as
needed. Makes 16 quarts of soup.

1  fat hen or chicken parts disjointed; (about 5 lbs.)
5  carrots, whole
1  whole parsley root with greens on t; op
2  onions each stuck with a whole clov; e
3  ribs of celery
1 small whole tomato
4 quart water
1 1/2 tablespoon salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

      ----LIVER DUMPLINGS----
1  raw chicken liver chopped fine
4  sprigs of parsley greens, minced
1 small onion, minced
4  whole eggs
1/2 tablespoon salt
2 cup flour

Winter is the time for Chicken Soup. Wind and snow whipping around the
yard. Windows get all steamed. Write your name on the mist. Smells
that you will recognize in later years with a tug on your heart.
There is no soup as good as the soup Mama made when you were young.

Regards, June Meyer. Cook chicken in pot with water, skiming the scum
off when starting soup to boil. Place all the vegetables and spices
in the pot. Cook under a low flame until the chicken is tender.
Remove as much fat as possible. Strain soup and serve with broad
noodles or LIVER DUMPLINGS. Eat chicken on the side with TOMATO SAUCE
or DILL SAUCE.

LIVER DUMPLINGS Mix all the ingredients together. A cusinart is great
for this. Drop into boiling water by the 1/2 teaspoonsful. Cook about
15 minutes or until done. If batter is too thick you can add a little
water. Drain and serve with soup. Serves a family.

Ice Cream Sandwiches - Martha Stewart Living

soup/stew, desserts, dairy, sandwiches

2 cup plus 2 t all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa
5 oz semisweet chocolate
4 oz unsweetened chocolate
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup sugar
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 pint each strawberry, vanilla, & chocola; te ice cream

1. Combine flour and cocoa and set aside. Melt together chocolates and
butter in medium bowl set over simmering water. Stir with a wooden
spoon until smooth. Add salt and sugar, stirring until sugar is
almost completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat.
Beat in eggs one at a time, then fold in flour mixture until well
combined. Let dough cool slightly in bowl; it will be very soft.
Divide into quarters and spoon onto plastic wrap. Flatten each piece
of dough with a wooden spoon, wrap well, and refrigerate for at least
2    hours or overnight.

2. When dough is firm, cut each piece in half. Cover a work surface
with plastic wrap. Place piece of dough on the plastic and cover with
another sheet; roll out to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Keeping dough in
plastic, transfer to a baking sheet; place in freezer. Repeat process
until all dough is and rolled out. Stack sheets of dough in freezer
and chill until very firm, about 30 minutes,

3. Heat oven to 350'. Line 1 baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove
sheets of dough from freezer one at a time. Place on a
parchment-lined work surface and peel off plastic wrap. Using a 2
1/2- inch round cookie cutter, cut out dough and transfer circles to
baking sheets. Work quickly to prevent the dough from becoming too
soft.

4. Bake until cookies are firm to the touch, 14 to 16 minutes, turning
baking sheet halfway through baking. Remove from oven and let cookies
cool slightly on pan. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

5. While cookies are baking, transfer ice cream (working with one
flavor at a time) to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
paddle attachment. Place ice cream in refrigerator to soften
slightly, about 15 minutes. Beat ice cream on medium-high speed until
soft enough to spread, about 2 minutes, or beat with a wooden spoon.
Set bowl in a second bowl filled with ice. Spoon some softened ice
cream onto a cookie and top with another cookie. Place sandwich in
freezer and continue process. After the ice cream has hardened, wrap
sandwiches tightly in plastic wrap. Chill overnight in freezer.

4 cup chicken broth
3 cup water
4 large flat-leaf parsley sprigs
2  fresh cilantro sprigs, roots and st; ems lightly crushed
1  whole chicken breast, rinsed well
3 medium waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into; 1/2 cubes
1/4 lb shallots
4 large garlic cloves
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled/minced

1  cinnamon stick (3)
1  coarse salt
1  freshly ground pepper
2 cup cooked angel hair pasta
3  hard-boiled eggs, quartered
1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves

Combine chicken broth, water, parsley and cilantro sprigs in

until aromatic, 3-4 minutes. Add shallot mixture to broth along with
cinnamon stick and salt and pepper to taste. Cook covered over medium
heat until potatoes are tender, 12-15 minutes. Remove potatoes from
broth with slotted spoon.

To assemble, lay out shallow soup or pasta bowls. Arrange chicken,
pasta, eggs and potatoes in section in each bowl, to make 4 wedges.

Instant Tomato Soup

soups, vegetables

4 tablespoon non-fat dry milk
2 tablespoon powdered dry tomatoes
1/8 teaspoon basil
1  salt (1/16 tsp)
1 dash pepper

Recipe by: Gwynne Bodle This is my wife's recipe for tomato soup. I
had some just last week and it is almost a year old. A friend who
tried it suggested adding dry onion or onion powder which we will
with this years batch. BTW, we dry our own tomatoes. If you use store
bought tomatoes than you may have to make some adjustments.

Combine all ingredients and seal in small plastic bags using a vacuum
sealer, such as Decosonic Pak-n-Save.

To use: Open package and place in a bowl or mug. Add 8 ounces boiling
water stirring constantly.

Note: If you dry your own tomatoes, dry until just brittle. Powder in
a blender. Dried tomato can also be found in health food stores. If
using dried tomato slices powder in blender.

Irish Cream Of Mussel Soup

fish, soups

32 medium mussels
1  onion; peeled/chopped
1  celery; chopped
1  leek (white part only); chop
1 cup white wine
3 cup fish stock
2 cup heavy cream
4  chervil or substitute parsle
1  salt and pepper to taste

Note: When buying mussels look for small ones that have tightly closed
shells - a sign that they are alive and thus fresher.
Place mussels, wine and fish stock in a stock pot. Add chopped
vegetables. Cover and shake to stir contents. Cook on high heat 4 to
5 minutes. After 5 minutes shake pot again, remove lid and strain
contents into a collander, catching liquid in a bowl. Then strain
soup liquid again through a wire mesh strainer into a saucepan. Over
high heat, boil and reduce soup for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, remove the mussel meat from most of the shells, leaving
some mussel shells intact for serving as a side dish with the chopped
vegetables.
Pour the heavy cream into reduced soup. Whisk while maintaining the
high heat. Add mussel meat slowly. Whisk gently. Then continue to
stir with a soup ladle until it boils.
Ladle soup into soup bowls. Add sprigs of chervil to top of soup for
garnish.
Serve the remaining mussels on the side with an array of the cooked
chopped vegetables.

Irish Stew [biddy Whyte Lennon]

lamb, stews

1 1/2 lb stewing lamb or mutton
2 large onions
3 lb potatoes
1 bunch parsley, fresh; large
2 teaspoon thyme, fresh; chopped
1  ; water
1  salt & pepper

Peel the onions and slice them into rounds.  Peel the potatoes as
thinly as possible.  Leave them whole unless they are very large.

Cut the meat into good-sized pieces.  Small chops can be left whole,
larger ones divided in two. Place a layer of onions on the bottom of
a heavy casserole, and the meat on top of them. Sprinkle chopped
thyme and parsley generously, and season well. Layer the rest of the
onions with the potatoes.  Sprinkle thyme and parsley again at the
last. The amount of water you need to add depends on how good the
seal is between your pot and its lid, and whether you like a "wet" or
"dry" stew. You will certainly not need more than two cups, and I use
barely one. Bring the water to a boil, cover as tightly as possible,
and place in a preheated oven at 300F for 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Keep an
eye on it towards the end, and adjust the gravy by adding a little
water if you think it too dry. A good stew should have some gravy,
but should not be flooded by it. "Floury" potatoes will dissolve into
the gravy, "waxy" ones will not. I tend to use a mixture. Serve very
hot with more fresh chopped parsley sprinkled on top. White soda
bread to mop up the gravy.

"There are more arguments about what makes a real Irish stew than
about any other recipe in the repertoire. Some people claim that if
you put carrots in it, it's not an Irish stew any more.  Others say,
leave the carrots in, but no parsnips! -- and the arguments go on."

Irish Stew With Frozen Tofu

casseroles, main dish, vegetarian, soup/stew, ireland

1/2 cup frozen tofu
1 small onion
6 oz potatoes
1 small carrot
1/2 teaspoon yeast extract
2/3 cup vegetable stock or water
1/2 cup whole wheat flour -=plus=-
2 tablespoon whole wheat flour
1 pinch sea salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 cup vegan margarine
1  soymilk as required
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon cider vinegar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Pour boiling water over the tofu, cover if possible, and leave for 10
to 15 minutes.

Chop the onion.  Dice the potatoes and carrot into small pieces. Add
the yeast extract to the stock or water and bring to the boil in a
saucepan. Add the onions and potatoes, lower heat, and leave to
simmer for 7-10 minutes.  Add the carrots and cook for a further 4-5
minutes.

While the vegetables are cooking put the 1/2 cup flour in a bowl and
mix in salt and baking powder.  Cut in the margarine, then pour in
enough soy milk (about 2 tablespoons) to make a soft dough. Divide
the dough into four balls.

Put the soy sauce, water, and vinegar into a small bowl. Drain the
tofu and squeeze it gently to extract excess liquid. Cut it into
small dice. Put the dice into the bowl with the soy sauce mixture and
stir it round; the liquid should be absorbed rapidly by the tofu.

Spread the 2 tablespoons flour on a plate and turn the tofu cubes in
it. Heat the oil in a skillet and stir-fry the tofu cubes until
lightly browned.

Add the tofu cubes to the vegetable mixture and turn into an oven
dish. Flatten the dough balls and place them on top. Place in a 435F
(220C) Gas Mark 7 oven for 15 minutes and serve immediately.

Iroquois Soup

cyberealm, ilink, native amer

4 each large mushrooms, sliced
2 each 10 1/2 oz cans beef consomme
2 tablespoon yellow corn meal
2 tablespoon minced parsley
1 centiliter garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon basil
1 each onion, thinly sliced
1  fresh ground pepper, dash
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  haddock fillets, 12 oz
10 oz baby lima beans
1/3 cup dry sherry (optional)

Place the mushrooms, consomme, corn meal, parsley, garlic, basil,
onion, pepper and salt in a large saucepan, and simmer, uncovered,
for 10 minutes. Add haddock, lima beans, and sherry and simmer 20
minutes, stirring occasionally, breaking haddock into bite-sized
pieces. Serve hot.

The Iroquois were blessed with clear, cool lakes and sparkling
streams, and both served up an abundance of fish.  Fish soup, or
u'nega'gei, as the Iroquois called it, was a favorite.  One early
recipe is described, "Fish of any kind is boiled in a pot with a
quantity of water. It is then removed and coarse corn siftings
stirred in to make a soup of suitable consistency."  When wild onions
and greens were available, they were usually tossed into the soup
pot, adding both color and flavor.

Italian Fish Soup

italian, seafood, soup/stew

1/2 cup olive oil
3  leeks, cleaned and sliced, white pa; rt only
2  cloves of garlic diced fine
1  yellow onion, peeled and chopped
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced
6 cup fish stock, clam nectar or water
1 cup italian tomato sauce
1 cup dry white wine (maybe soave)
1  cayenne pepper to taste
1 lb white fish boneless fillet, cut int; o small pieces
1  (cod, seabass, monkfish)
2 lb combined, of any or all of {the fol; lowing:
1  clams, soaked in fresh water 1 hour; then drained
1  crab,
1  shrimp,
1  mussels, scrubbed with the beards r; emoved

Serves 8

(don't leave these out they are cheap, tasty and attractive) You can
buy a 1/4 or 1/2 lb. of several items. Even if shrimp is $6 per lb.
1/4 lb. is affordable and will add flavor and variety.

Chopped parsley for garnish

Saute the leeks, onions, celery, garlic and mushrooms until the
onions are clear. Add the stock, nectar or water, tomato sauce and
white wine. Bring to a heavy simmer and taste. Add the cayenne pepper
and salt to taste.

Prepare the seafood and add to the pot, remembering to add first those
things which take longest to cook. The various shellfish go in with
the shells on.

Simmer until done. Serve in large bowls over spaghetti. By adding
extra fish such as a lobster per person this will become a meal
instead of a soup.

with their puree, vegetable stock, the remaining 1/2 tsp salt, and
the red pepper flakes; if using dried basil, add it now. Bring to a
simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring
occasionally, until the potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes to 1
hour.

Stir in the olives and, if using, the fresh basil, and continue
cooking to blend the flavors, about 5 minutes. Serve the stew hot,
warm or at room temperature.

Jat Juk (Cream Of Pine Nut Porridge)

soups, korean

1/2 cup pine nuts
1 cup water
4  dried jujubes (korean dates) soaked; in water 2 hours
2 teaspoon honey
1/4 cup rice flour; dissolved in 1/2 cup wate
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt

"The porridge, it is not quite a soup, is usually served on three
different occasions. The first is for breakfast as a special treat,
since pine nuts are expensive everywhere. The second is as a restorer
of strength for persons who are ill or debilitated. The third
occasion is as a snack anytime of day when special friends meet --
not the tea or coffee hour but pine-nut soup time."

1. Grind the pine nuts in a processor with 1/2 cup water for about 1/2
minute. Add the balance of the water and process the mixture until
smooth. Pour through a metal strainer and rub the particles through,
preferably with a wooden spoon. Discard the small amount of residue,
which is mostly the "eyes" or buds of the pine nuts.

2. When the jujubes are ready, cut out and discard the pits. Cut the
jujubes into thin slices and mix with the honey. Set aside.

3. Simmer the rice flour paste in a pan over low heat, stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon until the mixture just starts to
bubble. This is the soup thickener.

4. Add the pine nut mixture, the sugar and salt to the rice flour and
bring to a low boil for 2 minutes. The lightly thickened porridge,
smooth and creamy, is now ready.

Pour it into individual bowls and garnish with a teaspoon of the
jujube and honey.

Serve warm.

Jook~ Chinese Thick Rice Soup

soups

1/2 cup long grain rice
1/2 cup glutinous rice
5 quart chicken broth
1 lb ground pork
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt
2 each green onion stalks
12 each water chestnuts

Rinse rice 2 or 3 times. Soak overnight. Mince green onions and water
chestnuts. Mix with ground pork, soy sauce and salt. Bring stock and
rice to a boil. Turn heat down and simmer for 2-3 hours or until the
rice breaks down completely and the soup becomes thick and creamy.
Turn heat up and add ground pork mixture, shaping 1 tsp at a time
into a small ball and dropping it into the soup. Cook for 5 minutes
or until pork balls are done. Correct seasoning. Serve in individual
soup bowls. Pass the condiments around for each person to choose his
or her favourite toppings. I like Nam-Yuey in mine! You can make this
ahead of time and reheat. You can also use chicken slices, ground
beef, beef slices, fish filets or ham slices. A roast chicken or
turkey carcass is excellent for making the stock. Just cook the
carcass, rice and water together. Take out the carcass when the soup
is done. I add Duck Liver Sausage bits! Condiments which you can use:
Sesame oil, White Pepper, Green Onions, Chinese Parsley (cilantro),
tea melon (sweet cucumber), Szechwan turnips, chopped peanuts, Deep
Fried Devils (Yao Ja Guai, which are small fried bread sticks),

Finalist in 1980 Recipe Contest: JO STALLARD, Pacific Grove, CA.

"I'll never live this down;' teased grandmotherly Jo Stallard as she
was crowned with a tiara of fresh garlic and draped in garlic
wreaths. A vegetarian, Jo has turned her cooking talents to adapting
recipes for meatless cooking. This delicious soup has always been a
winner with her friends, she says, and so it was, too, with the 1980
Great Garlic Cook-off celebrity judges.

Generously butter inside of 3-quart baking dish. Combine all
ingredients, except cheese and cream, in dish. Cover and bake for 1
hour at 375 degrees. Stir in cheeses and cream, lower heat to 325
degrees and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer. Do not allow to boil.
Mmmmm- GOOD! Serves 4 to 6.

June Meyer's Authentic Hungarian Lentil Soup

hungarian, soups

1 lb dried lentils, washed and drained
1/4 cup lard, bacon drippings, or oil
2 medium onions, chopped
1  parsnip or parsley root, chopped
2 medium carrots, sliced
1 cup sliced celery
8 cup water
1 teaspoon salt to taste
1  several whole black pepper corns
2  whole cloves
2  bay leaves
1 large potato, peeled and grated
2 large links(or 4 small) smoked sausage, s; kin pricked with fork
2 tablespoon good vinegar

Hungarian soups are usually served in the fall and winter months.
When ever I make a large pot of soup in winter, the steam always
condenses on the windows. I then always think of a remote memory I
have of playing by a low window, water running down in little
riverlets, and shadowy forms passing by single file on the other side
of the window, and the wonderful smell of soup cooking. When I asked
my mother about the memory she said that my paternal grandmother had
died in January 1936, and family and guests were coming back from the
cemetary after the burial. It was frigid out and Hungarian soup,
bread and Strudel was made to feed the frozen mourners. I was two
years old and that faint memory has stayed with me for my whole life.

Never a separate course by itself, but always the main course. This is
another one of those hearty Peasant soups that is a complete meal by
itself. Serve it with some crusty bread, a chunk of cheese and a dark
beer. Serve in a large bowl steaming hot. Regards, June Meyer.

In a large pot, heat fat and add carrots, root vegetable and onions.
Saute until onions are golden. Add lentils, water, celery, and
seasonings. Grate the potato into the mixture and add sausage. Simmer
covered 1 hour until lentils and vegetables are tender. Remove bay
leaves. Add vinegar just before serving and adjust salt. Serve with a
crusty bread and salad.

Mongol Soup

If you add one can of tomato paste and two cans of water to the above
soup and puree it, you will have made another soup called Mongo Soup.
Try it, it is good.

June Meyer's Authentic Hungarian Sour Cherry

fruits, hungarian, soups

1 1/2 quart water
3 tablespoon flour
1 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 lb fresh or frozen pitted sour cherrie; s (do not use canned)
3/4 cup granulated sugar

Every Family has their version of Sour Cherry Soup. It is a special
seasonal treat in Hungary when the cherries are ripe. Sour Cherries
have a wonderful flavor when cooked. Some families like to make their
soup with sweet cream instead of sour cream. Some add a little
sherry. How ever you make this soup, you will enjoy its refreshing
flavor. Regards, June Meyer.

Into a soup pot containing 1 1/2 quarts of boiling water add fresh or
frozen sour cherries and granulated sugar. Stir and cook. In a
separate bowl mix flour, sour cream, salt and beat until smooth. Add
to flour mix, 1 cup of hot cherry sugar mix. Stir vigorously. Now add
the flour, sour cream and hot cherry mix into the pot of hot soup,
stir well and simmer for 5 or 6 minutes until it thickens. Cover the
soup and let cool. Keep cover on while it chills in refrigerator and
it will not form a thick skin. Serve very cold.

Note: to make Cherry Soup with Sweet Cream or Meggy Leves Mas Modon
Cook a 1 inch stick of cinnamon with the cherries, and substitute
sweet cream for the sour cream. Discard cinnamon stick when done
cooking soup. Chill as above.  WALT

June Meyer's Authentic Hungarian Tomato Soup

hungarian, soups

1/2 lb good bacon, sliced and cut in small; pieces
1 large onion, minced
32 oz can of crushed of pureed tomato siz; e
32 oz water
1/2 cup celery, minced
1 tablespoon sugar
1  a few peppercorns and salt to taste

Ah Paradise to eat Hungarian Tomato Soup. The tomato once feared as
being poisonous, was also called the Paradice Appfel or Apple of
Paradise. When my Grandmother came to this country from
Austria-Hungary, she brought not only flower seeds, Poppies included,
but all kinds of old-world tomato seeds. Hungarian heart shaped
tomatos, heavy, sweet and succulent. It was a yearly ritual in late
summer to can and bottle all those wonderful ripe tomatos the garden
produced. All winter long we children would be sent down to the
preserves cellar to bring up jars of tomatos, peppers, pickles,
dilled squash, plums, peaches, beets, jams and jellies. Alas, I no
longer have a garden so I must rely on store bought cans of tomatos.

Hungarian Pancakes, (Palacsinta) were always served after the soup
course. Thin crepes, slathered with strawberry jam, rolled up and
sprinkled with powdered sugar. This was a complete meal, good for a
Saturday noon, or Sunday night. Ah Paradise! Regards, June Meyer.

Saute bacon in a soup pot, and drain off bacon fat. Saute minced
onion and celery with bacon bits in pot till transparent. Add the can
of tomatos and add one can of water. Add 1 Tbls. sugar, and
peppercorns. Bring soup pot to low boil, and lower heat to simmer and
let simmer about
45    min. or 1hour. Soup can contain broad noodles, or rice.
precook these and add before serving. Serves 4 to 6.

The Story, Birgid Allen:

"(...) This is really a late spring soup, for that time when nothing
yet seems to be properly in season and when cold winds blight the
beginning of summer and give one unseasonable longings for warm,
comforting soups.

This is the time to forget asparagus and turn back to root
vegetables, such as the new, sharp-tasting young turnips in their
delicately purple-flushed white skins. These go well with the winter
and spring perennial, the bulbous Florentine fennel with its faintly
aniseed-like taste.

The rich, lemony stock, the sharp sorrel and garlicky tomato provide
a good background for the pungency of the young turnips and fennel.
It is worth boiling a chicken with a cut lemon inside it to produce
the right rich, strong broth to pull this soup together, remembering
that it is easily a meal in itself. (...)"

The Recipe

The day before making this soup, place a cut-up lemon inside your
chicken and boil for just over 1 hour (for a 1.35 kg/3 pounder),
adding a peeled onion and carrot, black peppercorns and sea salt to
the water. Strain off the broth and refrigerate it overnight.

Soak the split peas either overnight or for several hours, then boil
them in plenty of unsalted water for 30 minutes to 1 hour until they
are soft. The first 10 minutes of boiling should always be fast and
uncovered; the rest may be a steady simmer with the lid on.

Meanwhile, peel the onions and turnips, and scrape the carrots and
fennel; chop them all into small dice and soften them for 15 minutes
in olive oil in a heavy, covered pan.

Crush the garlic in a mortar with a little sea salt and add it to the
vegetables with the tomatoes and the thyme or marjoram, raising the
heat a little and cooking uncovered for 5-20 minutes while breaking
up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon.

Then add the drained split peas, the skimmed stock and the washed and
torn-up sorrel leaves. (Spinach will do, but it will not contribute
such an interestingly acidic flavour.)

Bring to the boil, simmer for 30 minutes, cool and serve. Add more
salt ift he split peas seem to demand it, but do not liquidize the
soup unless you want their taste to be dominant.

Kabocha Squash Chowder

soups

6 oz bacon; diced
1  yellow onion; peel/dice
1  red bell pepper; dice
2  stalks celery; dice
1/4 bunch fresh thyme; chopped
1/4 bunch fresh oregano; chopped
1 tablespoon garlic; chopped
2 tablespoon flour
1 1/2  kabocha; peel/seed/dice
2 quart chicken stock
2  bay leaves
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1/2 bunch scallions; sliced thin
1/4 bunch parsley; chopped
1  chopped smoked almonds

Render the diced bacon until crispy; drain and
reserve.  Using a little of the bacon fat, slowly
sweat the celery, onion and peppers with 1/4 teaspoon
salt. When soft, add the garlic and chopped herbs and
cook until fragrant, about 2  minutes. Add the flour
and cook for another 2 minutes. Add in a third of the
stock, bring to a boil stirring constantly, add the
remaining stock and the diced squash and bay leaves.

Let simmer slowly, until the squash is tender; it will
thicken and color the soup as it softens. The squash
should be soft but still hold its shape. Season with
salt  and pepper. Off the heat, add the scallions, the
bacon and  parsley, garnish with toasted or smoked
chopped almonds or walnuts for a nice crunch.

Kaeng Som Phak Bung Phrik Sod Kab Pla~ Sour F

hot, soups, thai

1  chile paste
3 tablespoon red birdeye, dynamite chilis
3 tablespoon finely sliced shallots
3 tablespoon crushed garlic
1 tablespoon kapi, fermented shrimp paste
1  a dash of fish sauce.
1  for soup
1 lb fish, diced
2 lb vegetables
10 small tomatoes
1  /skinned/seeded/diced
3 tablespoon lime juice
3 tablespoon fish sauce
3 tablespoon tamarind juice
1  (or rice vinegar)
3 tablespoon green jalapenos,
1  thinly sliced
1 tablespoon sour hot sauce
1  (such as tabasco)

This is a simple hot and sour soup, made with the fish
of your choice. In Thailand the vegetable is generally
phak bung (swamp cabbage), but if you don't have that
cabbage, kale, or even broccoli can be substituted

method

combine the ingredients for the chili paste to a fine
even consistency.

Wash and dice the fish.

Place the fish in a bowl, add the lime juice, fish
sauce, tamarind juice, Tabasco and chili paste, and
leave to marinade for at least an hour.

Bring two cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan
or wok, and add the liquid from the marinading fish,
then add the vegetables and boil for about two
minutes. Adjust the flavour to taste (it should be a
little salty and a little sour, and as hot as you
desire it at this stage).

Add the tomato and bring back to the boil

Add the remaining ingredients, return to the boil, and
stir occasionally until the fish is cooked.

Kaernemaelkskoldskaal (Cold Buttermilk Soup)

cheese/eggs, soup/stew

3  egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon lemon rind; grated
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla (opt)
1 quart buttermilk
1/4 cup heavy cream; whipped (opt)

"The flavor of commercial buttermilk varies enormously
from dairy to dairy. Natural fresh buttermilk, if
available, would be ideal for this unusual summer
luncheon or dessert soup, but cultured buttermilk of
good flavor will do almost as well." With an electric
beater or wire whisk, beat the egg yolks in a large
bowl. Gradually add the sugar, beating until the eggs
fall back into the bowl in a lazy ribbon when the
beater is lifted. Add the grated lemon rind and juice
and the optional vanilla. Slowly beat in the
buttermilk, continuing to beat until the soup is
smooth. Serve in chilled bowls and float a spoonfull
of unsweetened whipped cream on the surface of each
service if you like. Buttermilk soup is traditionally
served with Oat Cakes. (See recipe.)

Kai Tom Khing (Chicken Soup With Lemon & Ging

thai, soup/stew

2 tablespoon olive oil
1  clove garlic, chopped
12 oz chicken breast, diced
4 cup water
4 oz straw mushrooms, chopped
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 small green chilies, sliced in rings
2  spring onions, chipped
1 pinch ground ginger
      ----GARNISH----
1  coriander leaves

Here's another simple recipe.  Straw mushrooms are
available canned in the Oriental section of many
supermarkets or fresh in Asian groceries. Enoki
mushrooms would probably be a good substitute,
although I haven't tried that...

Heat the oil in a saucepan or wok and fry the garlic
until soft but not brown.

Add the chicken and stir-fry for 5 minutes. cool a
little. Add the water and mushrooms.  Bring to the
boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice.
Cover, and cook gently for a further 10 minutes.

Add the chilies, spring onions and ginger.  Remove
from the heat. Sprinkle with coriander leaves before
serving.

2  sprigs fresh thyme
1 cup dry white wine water, more if neces; sary

seasonings.

Arrange the toast slices in large soup plates.  Serve
the varied fishes and broth in each bowl, hot, with
croutons in a separate plate.

NOTE: Kakavia is frequently made in the following
variation: Cook 2 to 3 fish with the vegetables and
strain with the vegetables to make a thicker stock.
Continue to cook the remaining seafood as described
above.

Kang Cheud Tang-Ran Sodsai - Stuffed Zucchini

pork, poultry, soups, oriental

3  zucchini, medium size.
1 1/2 cup lean ground pork or chicken.
2  eggs, lightly beaten.
2 tablespoon fish sauce.
1  ground white peppers.
2 tablespoon cilantro, chopped.
6 cup chicken or pork stock.

Peel zucchini and cut into approximately 1-1/2"
lengths.  Make the lengths of zucchini into cups by
scooping out the seeds in the center, but leaving
small amount to form the bottom of the cup.  You may
need more or less zucchini than the amount given,
depending on their size. In a bowl, mix the ground
pork or chicken with fish sauce, eggs, ground white
peppers, and cilantro.  Fill the zucchini cups with
the mixture, and overfill slightly to make a small
mound.  Cook the filled zucchini cups by steaming for
about 1/2 hour. Bring the chicken or pork stock to a
boil, and season to taste.  Place the precooked
zucchini cups into a serving tureen, pour the boiling
stock over them, and serve.

Kathy Pitts' Kinda Ratatouille (I Improvise A

stews, vegetables

1 small eggplant, unpeeled, and cut into 1-; inch chunks)
1 large onion, sliced
1  green bell pepper, sliced
1  red bell pepper, sliced
1  yellow bell pepper,sliced
3  tomatoes, 1 chunks
2  zucchini or other summer squash, cu; t in 1 chunks
3 centiliter garlic, minced
1  olive oil
1  chopped fresh herbs
1  (basil, oregano, parsley)
1  salt, pepper to taste

Use a big deep fryin pan for this (your chicken fryer
would be about right).  It's the kind of dish that
tends to "grow" alarmingly as you toss things in.

Film the bottom of the pan with olive oil, and heat
until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and garlic,
and saute until wilted.  Add the tomatoes and
eggplant, and cook until they begin to release some of
their juices.  Now toss in everything else, cover the
pan, and cook over low heat, stirring frequently,
until the remaining vegetables are tender. Season to
taste with herbs, salt, pepper, and remove from the
heat.

May be served hot, at room temperature (best, IMHO),
or slightly chilled.

I can make a meal of this with some good French or
Italian bread and butter, but it's also a nice side
dish with grilled poultry.

Ken's Tomato Egg Drop Soup

chinese, hom

1 quart chicken stock
2 medium fresh tomatoes -=or=- drained, cann; ed tomatoes
2 small eggs
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
2 teaspoon light soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon finely chopped scallions
1  white part only
1  (reserve tops for garnish)

Egg Drop Soup is traditionally Chinese. Tomatoes are not. They were
introduced less than 100 years ago, but nevertheless, they work
wonderfully in this soup.

PUT THE CHICKEN STOCK into a pot and bring to a simmer. If using fresh
tomatoes, peel, seed and cut into 1-inch cubes. If using canned
tomatoes, chop them into small chunks. Lightly beat the eggs, then
combine them with sesame oil in a small bowl. Add the light soy sauce
and salt to the simmering stock, and stir to mix them in well. Add
the tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes. Next, stir in the scallions,
and then add the egg mixture in a very slow, thin stream. Using a
chopstick or fork, pull the egg slowly into strands. (Stirring the
egg in a "figure 8" works well.) Garnish with the finely chopped
scallion tops.

kidney in it quickly.  Pour off any excess fat, then
stir in the flour, turning the kidney pieces in it.

cold take off any fat from the top, then remove the

pieces of kidney are not liked, strain the soup;  or
it can be liquidized.  Bring to just under boiling

King's Arms Tavern Cream Of Peanut Soup

soups

1  onion, chopped
2  celery ribs, chopped
1/4 cup butter
3 tablespoon flour, all purpose
2 quart chicken stock
2 cup peanut butter, smooth
1 3/4 cup light cream
1  peanuts, chopped

Servings: 12

Saute onion and celery in butter until soft, but not
brown. Stir in flour until well blended. Add chick
stock, stirring constantly, and bring to a boil.
Remove from heat and rub through a sieve. Add peanut
butter and cream, stirring to blend thoroughly. Return
to low heat, but do not boil, and serve, garnished
with peanuts.

Note: This soup is also good served ice cold.

This is as served at the King's Arms Tavern in
Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.

"Peanuts (ground nuts) are from Brazil that sailed
with the Portuguese explorers to Africa and back to
the Americas with the Negro. In 1794, Thomas Jefferson
recorded the yield of sixty-five peanut hills at
Monticello.  The cultivation of peanuts increased in
the South in the nineteenth century, but it was not
until after the Civil War that they gained national
acceptance."

Kiros Kai Faki

soups

      ----KLINGON PIGS FEET & PEA SOUP---
2 1/2 lb fresh pigs feet or pork hocks salt
1 lb yellow split peas
1  onion; chopped
2 quart water butter

The night before you plan to make this soup, soak the
feet or hocks in brine (1 tablespoon of salt per quart
of water). They should be completely covered. Put the
split peas to soak in plain cool water. There should
be about 2 inches of water over the peas--they will
swell quite a bit. The meat should be put in the
refrigeratior overnight; the peas may be, too, but it
is less important.
In the morning, take the meat out of the brine, put
it in a 8 qt. pot, add the peas, onion and 2 quarts of
fresh water. Bring to a boil. Skim off any foam that
comes to the top, then reduce the heat and simmer for
about 6 or more hours, stirring occasionally so the
peas do not stick to the bottom of the pot. The meat
should be fallng off the bones, and the soup should be
quite thick and fairly smooth.
Take the meat and bones out of the soup and cool
slightly. Take the meat off the bones and cut into
smaller pieces. Put the meat back into the soup and
reheat if necessary. Serve with a small pat of butter
in the center of each bowl.

3 tablespoon of caraway seeds
1  flour and shortening for roux
1  water
1  egg (optional)
1  .paprika

Make a roux with flour and shortening, paprika and
caraway seed. When done, add water to fill pot (1
quart), and bring to boil. Careful now...don't let it
get lumpy.  Let boil for 3-4 minutes till flour taste
is gone. If you don't care for the idea of eating the
caraway seeds, you can quickly pour soup through
sieve. It's all ready to serve...however, a variation
is to scramble an egg into it for the "egg drop"
effect. Caraway Soup - Komenymagos Leves

Krautlsuppe (Bavarian Herb Soup)

german, soup/stew

1 lb herbs *
4 tablespoon butter
1 large onion, chopped
1 quart water or vegetable stock
1 large potato, peeled and chopped into sma; ll cubes

Serves 4.

salt and pepper bread cubes for croutons

* at least 3 of these:  chervil, watercress, spinach,
sorrel (dandelion and pimpernel for brave souls)
Bitter herbs are traditionally eaten at Easter in
Christian countries as a sign of penitence. This
Bavarian soup is served on Easter Thursday, known as
Maundy Thursday. Fresh chervil, easily available in
any German market, is usually the dominating flavor.
This is a delicate fresh-tasting soup for any time of
the year.

You will need a large saucepan.  Pick over and wash
the herbs, stripping the leaves from those stalks
which are too woody.  Chop the rest.

Melt the butter in a deep pan and fry the onion gently
until transparent. Add the herbs and sweat them for a
moment before you pour in the water or broth.  Add the
potato to the soup. Bring the soup to a boil, and then
turn down the heat.  Simmer for 20 minutes.  Mash the
potato in the soup to thicken it a little.  Taste, and
add salt and freshly milled pepper.

Serve with bread croutons fried in butter or bacon fat
(goose fat is even better).  They should be so hot
that they sizzle when they are added to the hot soup
at the table.

Lamb Cacciatore

meats, soups

4 lb lamb shoulder or leg; trim fat and cut into bit
1/3 cup olive oil
1 small garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon rosemary, dried, crushed
1/2 teaspoon sage leaves, dried
2 teaspoon flour
1/2 cup vinegar (white or wine)
1/2 cup water
1  salt and pepper, to taste

In a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish brown the meat in hot olive
oil.
Be careful not to burn the olive oil: it has a lower burning
temperature than other kinds of cooking oil.

Add garlic, rosemary and sage.  Stir.  Sprinkle flour on meat and
stir. Continue cooking the meat while stirring, to brown the flour a
bit. Add vinegar and water. Stir thoroughly. Cover, lower heat, and
simmer 1 hour or until meat is tender. Season to taste with salt and
pepper.

Stir frequently during cooking, and add a little hot water if
necessary to prevent burning.

NOTES:

*  An Easy Lamb Stew -- I got this recipe from my mom. I'm not sure
where she got it. It's not a typical cacciatore (i.e. smothered in
tomato sauce); instead, it's tart and tastes of herbs. It smells
great when it's cooking. It's very easy to make.  Yield:  Serves 4 to
6.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20-30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Leberknoedel (Liver Dumplings)

german, soup/stew

4  chopped, stale kaiser-type rolls
1  onion, finely chopped
150 gm ground liver (5 oz)
1  a little scraped spleen (optional)
2 tablespoon marjoram*
1  egg
1/8 liter milk (1/2 cup plus 1/2 tbsp)
1  salt
1  pepper
1  ground nutmeg
1  1          [small] bunch parsley, c; hopped
1  a little bit grated lemon peel
1  a little butter for sauteing

Soak the rolls in lukewarm milk.  Saute the onion and parsley in
butter, then add - along with the other ingredients - to the soaked
rolls and mix well into a firm mass. If the mixture is too loose, add
a bit of plain breadcrumbs.  Shape into dumplings, put into barely
boiling water, and let steep for 25 minutes. Transfer to clear beef
broth and serve.

Serves 4.

[*Note:  Based on the amount, I would imagine this is fresh marjoram.

4 oz butter
4 oz flour
3 pint milk or single cream

Cut Leek into small dice along with onion. Melt butter in pan,add
Leek and Onion. Cook on low gaa for 10 min.. Add flour and mix very
well to form a thick paste. Add milk slowly. Stirring continuously,
simmer for 10 minutes. Add in Stilton(grated) and stock cube, then
liquidize.

Stilton is a very strong aged cheese. One could probably substitute
real Roquefert or its poor electrically aged cousin Blue Cheese and
it still would be wonderful.

Leek Potato Soup

soups, vegetables

3 each large bunches leeks
3 lb potatoes
3 each large onions
2 each garlic clusters
1 quart milk (optional)
1 quart half and half (optional)
1 pint heavy cream (optional)
3 cup chicken stock (clear)
3 cup water
1 single salt and/or pepper

Peel the potatoes in advance and keep them submerged under cold
water to prevent discoloration.
Smash the garlic clusters on their sides to seperate the cloves. Cut
off the large end of the cloves and crush the clove by laying the
cloves on a flat surface, and pressing down on them under the side of
the blade of a wide, bladed knife. Remove the peelings from the
crushed cloves. (This is a very easy way to peel garlic.)
Inspect the leeks and remove any parts of the plants that are
withered or discolored. Chop the onions. Coarsely chop the leeks,
including the leaves. Saute the leeks, onions, and garlic in peanut
oil. Peanut oil seems to work best but olive oil or corn oil may be
used. Saute until tender. Set aside in a strainer to drain any excess
oil. Select a pot large enough to cook the potatoes with some room to
spare for the soup. Add 3 cups of chicken stock and 3 cups of water.
Make sure the chicken stock is clear; containing no fat. If homemade
chicken stock is not available then substitute with instant chicken
broth, but use locally prepared stock if possible.
Cook the potatoes in the stock/water combination for 25 - 30
minutes, or until done. Remove the potatoes and reduce heat under the
pot, but keep the liquid hot.
Drain the potatoes and insure the sauted vegatables are drained.
Place potatoes and the drained vegatables in a food processor and
blend on medium to high speed until smooth. Return the blended
mixture to the liquid in the soup pot. Stir well and increase heat.
Heat just to boiling. If the soup appears to be too thick at this
stage slowly add a little more stock or water. If desired add salt
and pepper to taste.
The soup is ready to serve at this point, especially as low fat or a
lite soup. But I like to add milk or cream.
When the liquid reachs boiling point, add the milk or cream. Stir.
Milk produces a thinner soup than the cream. Cream or Half-N-Half
provides a full flavor with more body. Heat to just below the boiling
point. Be careful at this stage and do not boil after adding the milk
or cream. Too much heat at this time will cause the soup to stick to
the pot and loose flavor. Serve immediately with fresh baked bread or
homemade croutons. Additional comments: The amounts of the
ingredients are not critical to a successful soup. If you like garlic
its hard to put too much in this receipe. The amount of onions can be
varied also. The more onions, the better it seems to be. A ratio of
one bunch of leeks to one pound of potatoes is OK. But more leeks
doesn't spoil it either. For people without a large food processor:
The potatoes can me prepared as if making mashed potatoes (with a
mixer) but with just potatoes. If the mixture becomes too dry add
water or milk while beating. Blend the sauted vegetables in the food
processor and add to the beaten potatoes. Blend until smooth before

Legal's Inaugral Fish Chowder

fish, soups

1/2 cup butter
3 cup diced onions
1/4 cup finely grated carrots
2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 cup flour
12 cup concentrated fish stock
4 lb chowder fish fillets, such as 2 lbs; . cod, 1 lb. monkfish and
1 lb cusk (note from al: i believe any f; irm white fish will do)
2 cup light cream
1/2 cup finely grated monterey jack cheese

salt freshly ground black pepper

Heat the butter in a large saucepan until softened, and saute the
onions, carrots and garlic in it, stirring frequently, for about 5
minutes. Remove from heat and slowly stir in the flour. Return to the
heat, and cook, stirring, for about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, begin
heating the stock in a large pot. Whisk the stock into the flour
mixture. Bring the stock to a boil, whisking constantly, then reduce
the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.

Add the fish and simmer about 10 minutes longer.  Stir in the cream
and cheese, and simmer until the cheese melts, about 5 to 8 minutes.
(You won't distinguish the cheese as such, it is incorporated in the
chowder.) Reheat the chowder slowly so the cream doesn't boil.

Makes about 3 quarts.

Lencseleves Fogoyhussal (Lentil Soup With Par

soup/stew, game, hungary, fowl

2 each partridges
1 cup lentils
6 cup broth, chicken
1 lb veal bones
1 medium carrots; peeled
1 each parsnip; peeled
1 each celery knob; peeled
1/4 lb bacon, smoked
2 tablespoon flour, all-purpose
1 small onions; chopped
1/2 teaspoon mustard, prepared
1/3 cup heavy cream

Soak partridges in cold water 3-4 hours. Place lentils in soup pot
with chicken broth, veal bones, carrot, parsnip and celery. Slowly
bring to a boil.
Cut smoked bacon into small dice and render fat. With slotted spoon
remove cracklings and set aside.
Dry partridges. Very quickly brown the whole bird in the bacon
drippings, giving them some color. Remove partridges and place in
soup pot with lentils.
Make a roux with the same fat used to brown the partridges and the
flour and onion. Add 1/2 cup cold water and whip until smooth.
When partridges and lentils are done, about 2 hours, add liquified
roux. Cook for an additional 10 minutes. Take out partridges and bone
them. Replace meat chunks in soup. Just before serving, whip mustard
and cream into the soup.

Note: partridges can be one of the toughest birds in the world, and
the 2 hour cooking time may be longer. This is an excellent way to
prepare what would otherwise be a very tough bird.

Lentil & Spinach Soup Adas Bi Sabaanikh (V

soups

1 1/2 cup dried lentils
8 cup water
1 large onion; chopped
3  garlic cloves; crushed
6 oz tomato paste
2 bunch spinach; cleaned & chopped
1/2 cup fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/8 teaspoon crushed red hot pepper flake
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice

This is a Middle Eastern soup, typical of the simple foods served in
the desert regions. Serve with pita bread and a grain or vegetable
dish for a simple meal. This soup is also food served cold, stuffed
into a pita bread. Place the lentils and water in a large pot. Bring
to a boil, cover, and cook for 30 minutes over medium low heat. Add
the onion , tomato paste and garlic and cook an additional 30
minutes. Add the spinach, parsley, and peppers. Mix well and cook for
another 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice just before serving. Mix in
well and serve at once. I added a bit of fresh ground nutmeg & salt
to taste. Note: I have found that balsamic vinegar in place of lemon
juice is wonderful with lentils and imparts a slightly sweet taste...

L'estouffat De Noel (Bordeaux Christmas Beef Stew)

french, stews

3 lb top round
6  carrot
2  leek
2 large onion
2  shallot
6  garlic clove
1  celery rib; sliced
12 slice bacon
1  bay leaf, turkish
5  parsley sprig
1 1/2 teaspoon peppercorns
1 1/2 tablespoon thyme, dried
1 teaspoon salt
2  cloves, whole
1 1/4 liter bordeaux red; decent
1/3 cup wine vinegar, red
1/4 cup cognac

Cut beef into 8 oz chunks.  This is important; smaller chunks will
fall apart during the long cooking.  Cut carrots in 1" chunks.  Use
only the white of the leek; halve each and wash well, then cut into
1" chunks. Slice onions thinly.  Chop shallots; peel and mash garlic
cloves. Slice celery thinly.  Cut bacon rashers (slab bacon only,
please) in 1" slices. DO NOT use California bay leaf in this recipe;
the California bay leaf has a very strong, harsh taste which will
ruin the entire dish. Look for an imported (Turkish) bay leaf.  For
the wine, use something considerably better than Gallo jug; the
instructor used a couple of $10 French Bordeaux.

Combine all ingredients in a heavy casserole (8 to 10 quarts);
marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  Slowly bring the
casserole to a simmer while you make a luting (sealing) paste of
flour and water. When ready, put a thick strip of dough around the
lid where it meets the pot and clamp on well; then take the remaining
luting paste and seal well around the outside.  The pot should be
completely sealed; no steam (or only the occasional wisp) should
escape.  Simmer the stew at 100 F to 150 F for 8 to 10 hours in the
oven; the lower temperature and longer cooking is more desirable.
Break open the crust and serve over potato purée.

Lima Bean & Leek Soup

beans, soups, vegan

8 cup water
1/3 cup lentils
1/3 cup lima beans
1/3 cup wild rice
1 large leek
1/4 cup tomato sauce or ketchup
4 dash hot sauce or more
4 dash fish sauce
4 dash soy sauce
2  chicken bouillon cubes

This recipe would be vegan if the fish sauce and bouillon cubes are
eliminated and vegetable bouillon and extra soy used in their place.
I am sure it would taste even better with the addition of a good
stewing chicken, but it was created from the materials on hand one
weekend. The lentils are long cooked until they disintegrate to form
a meaty looking and tasting stock, an effect that is enhanced by the
tomato.

Bring the water to a boil in a soup pot and add lentils; simmer
covered 1/2 hr or more. Add the lima beans and cook another 1/2 hour.
Add the rice and cook another 20 min. Add the chopped green portions
of a large or 2 medium well washed leek[s] [They are sandy and there
is always sand trapped in the outer leaves] and simmer 10 min. Add
the sliced white portion of the leek and the remaining ingredients.
Simmer 15 min and serve.

Lovage~ Potato & Buttermilk Soup

soup/stew

2 1/2 oz finely chopped onion
10 oz corsely grated raw potato
1  fresh young lovage leaves
1 1/4 pint chicken or vegetable stock
1/2 pint buttermilk, more if desired

Put the onion into a heavy-based saucepan.  Add the stock and bring to
boiling point very slowly so the onion begins to soften a little.

Meanwhile coarsely chop a small handful (5 or so tablespoons) of
lovage. Add the potato and herbs to the pan and pour on 1/2 pint
buttermilk. Increase the heat very slightly and bring the mixture to
a bare simmer. Stir vigorously all the while as the potato starch
will thicken the soup, which may stick to the pan base. Half-cover
the pan and reduce heat as low as possible once again.  Cook very
gently indeed, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are
perfectly tender.

Whizz the contents of the pan to a smooth puree. Season with salt and
pepper and with extra lovage if you like. Whizz again and thin to
taste with a little more stock or buttermilk. Reheat gently or chill
thoroughly before serving, then garnish with a swirl of buttermilk
and a small flotilla of chopped fresh lovage.

time as the cut-up intestines, adjusting the liquid by adding more
water.

Clean the intestines thoroughly by turning them inside out, using a
long skewer or stick (this turning will be quicker if the intestines
are first cut into 2-foot lengths), then wash under cold running
water until clean. Rub the intestines with salt and the juice of 1/2
lemon, rinse again in cold water and drain. Braid the intestines or
tie the ends together with clean string. Put in a large soup pot with
the lamb's head, if using, and cove with cold water. Bring to a boil,
then lower the heat, skim, and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the
intestines, drain them, and cut into 1/4 inch pieces with the
scissors and set aside to add to the soup later. (Use the remaining
portion of the head for another dish.)

Bring the soup stock to a boil and add the scallions, parsley, dill,
and celery leaves. Cut the heart, lungs, and liver into small
bite-sized cubes, and add them to the soup, and simmer for 15
minutes. Add the rice, cut-up intestines, aniseed, salt and pepper to
taste and continue simmering until the rice is tender, approximately
15 minutes, adding more water as needed and the brains during the
last few minutes of cooking.

Half an hour before serving, bring the soup to a boil, then remove
from the heat and prepare the avgolemono: Beat the eggs for 2
minutes. Continue to beat, gradually add the remaining lemon juice.
Then 1 to 2 cups of the hot soup by droplets, beating steadily, until
all has been added. Add the avgolemono to the soup. Stir over minimum
heat until thickened. Serve warm but avoid boiling the soup after
adding the avgolemono.

A richer Mageritsa can be made by sauteing the scallions in 3
tablespoons butter or oil before adding to the soup.

Making Soup (Information)

soups, info

1  text only

From an article by Louise Tennent Smith.

"Making soup is fun, an exercise in kitchen creativity which cannot go
wrong---you can ALWAYS fix a soup.

"Homemade stock is good, and easy to make, though time consuming. But
don't give up on soup making if you haven't time to make your own.
There are good canned. dried and frozen bases that will allow you to
whip up a good soup in no time at all.

"Seasoning:  The stock itself gives the base seasoning to a soup, as
do herbs and spices added during the cooking. The addition of wine
frequently enhances the flavor. Add about one-quarter cup to one
quart of soup just before serving, and do not boil after adding. Use
sherry for light soups with a chicken base, red wine with beef based
soups, white wine with fish soups.  A cup of beer for every three
cups of soup is good with bean and other hearty vegetable soups.

"Thickening:  Cooked cereals such as rice, noodles and dumplings give
body to a clear soup; added raw, they will thicken a soup. Other
thickeners include egg yolks, pureed vegetables and roux of flour and
butter.

"Color:  Soups using a good quantity of meat, onion skims, tomato
skins or browned onions usually have excellent color. Other color
additives include browning sauce, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup,
wine, tomato sauce and soy sauce.  The latter group should be used
with great care in delicate soups, as their flavor might be
overwhelming."

Mama Bina's Italian Chicken Soup

soups

1  stewing chicken, cut into pieces
2  whole carrots, finely diced
1/2 cup chopped parsley (preferably italian; parsley)
3 cup to 4 c cooked pastina or rice

FROM:      Shelley Rodgers (Jolly Rodgers:the Portuguese Pirate!
(1:161/202))

This recipe came from an unknown magazine.  Judging from the comments
that accompanied the recipe, apparently the magazine was running a
Chicken Recipe contest.

Mama Bina's Italian Chicken Soup No Chicken Recipe Contest worth its
bouillon would be complete without a recipe for chicken soup. This
recipe was submitted by Renata Pagliaro and Maureen Vieck of
Cuperino, CA. Renata writes: "I can remember as a child my mother
would prepare chicken soup at least once a week for dinner. Typical
of children, I thought that soup was boring (hardly to be compared to
a hot dog!) and I also thought it was some strange dish that only
Italians ate.

"Now that I am older and ore sophisticated (enough to even like
spinach!), I have come to appreciate my mother's chicken soup. It is
delicate and so simple taht it is actually elegant. To top all of
that, it is easy to make, nutritious and low in calories."

salt to taste

Wash the chicken pieces and remove as much skin as possible. Put the
chicken into a large dutch oven, fill with water and cook over high
heat. When the water boils, skim off the foam that comes to the
surface and discard.

When no more foam appears, put the carrots and parsley into the pot
with the chicken. Lower the heat to a simmer so taht the water
doesn't boil down. Do not cover. Add salt to taste and check every so
often for flavor.

Allow to cook for 1-1/2 hours.  You may prepare rice or pastina in the
meantime and set it aside.  After soup has cooked, remove the chicken
from the pot with a slotted spoon. Take the chicken off the bones and
tear into bite-sized pieces and place back into the broth.

Put the cooked and strained pastina or rice into the soup and allow
to heat through.  Just before serving, you may add a little butter
for flavor.

Serve hot with a crusty French bread and a bottle of white wine. This
soup

Mama's Escarole Soup

chicken

2 tablespoon olive oil
2  garlic cloves, minced
1  onion, chopped
2  carrots, sliced
1  potato, peeled, diced (opt)
2 cup chicken broth
2  heads of escarole, well
1  washed and coarsely cut

In a large saucepan, heat olive oil and gently brown garlic. Add
onion, carrots and if using, the potato (this helps to thicken the
soup as it breaks up), and after 1 minute, the broth. Add escarole,
cover and let come to a boil. Lower to simmer for 1 hour. For more
liquid soup, add a little more broth or water. Its also delicious to
add spareribs and/or a few pieces of Italian sausages before you
brown the vegetables. Make sure the meat is well cooked. Then add
everything else. Serve sprinkled with grated cheese and soft Italian
bread.

Mamma Mary's Pasta E Fagioli

italian, pasta, soups

2  garlic cloves; minced
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 can tomato sauce (8 oz)
1 cup water
1 can cannellini beans (16 oz)
1/2 lb ditalini or elbow macaroni
1  fresh parsley; chopped
1  cheese; grated

In a saucepan, fry the garlic gently in the oil until golden brown.
Add the tomato sauce and water, and let cook for 10 minutes. Add
beans, stir gently, continue to cook on simmer. Cook ditalini or
elbow macaroni al dente, drain and add to bean mixture.  Stir gently.
If it gets too thick, add a little more water.  Add parsley. Serve
immediately, or else the pasta will absorb all the liquid. This is so
good that I would double the recipe, because it is delicious when
sprinkled with grated cheese, with Italian bread dipped in the sauce.
Some people love it cold the next day, or you can add a little water
and warm it up. Enjoy! Serves 4.

VARIATIONS:  Omit the can of tomato sauce and it becomes a "white
sauce" utilizing the white bean juice. Pasta e Fagioli is great with
a sprinkle of crushed, dried hot pepper flakes.  ALTERNATIVE: Replace
cannellini beans with a can of chick peas, sweet peas, black eye peas
or lima beans - whatever matches your wallpaper best!

Mandarin Soup

soups

4  straw mushrooms, dried
1/4 lb pork, lean
1/2 cup bamboo shoots
1  bean curd, fresh (2 pieces)
4 cup chicken stock
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
2 tablespoon cornstarch, mixed with
1/4 cup water
1  egg
1  scallion, chopped
1 tablespoon sesame oil

Soak mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes.  Drain, reserving
liquid. Cut pork, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, bean curd into thin
strips.

Combine stock and reserved mushroom liquid in a saucepan. Bring to a
boil. Add salt, soy sauce, pork, bamboo shoots, mushrooms. Cover and
simmer 5 minutes. Add bean curd and again bring to a boil. Add small
amount of hot liquid to cornstarch paste, stirring. Add mixture to
pan and cook for 1 or 2 more minutes.

Beat egg lightly and slowly add it to hot soup.  Stir once, gently.
Remove soup from heat.  Sprinkle with chopped scallion and sesame
oil. Serve immediately.

NOTES:

*  Bamboo shoot, pork and mushroom soup -- I worked out this recipe
in an attempt to duplicate the Mandarin Soup served at the Peking
Royal Kitchen in Pittsburgh. My friends all agree that it is a good
replica; some prefer my version to the "real thing." Yield: Serves
4-6.

*  The quality of the chicken stock makes a huge difference in a
recipe like this. Use fresh stock if you can, or buy the best grade
of canned chicken stock you can find.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes waiting and 20 minutes preparing.
: Precision:  Measure spices and seasonings.

Margo's Lamb Stew

meats, soups

3 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion (thinly sliced)
4  garlic cloves, minced
3 lb lamb cut into stew-sized cubes and; carefully trimmed of fat
4 lb tomatoes, cooked (2 large cans)
3  bay leaves
1  lemon juice
1 tablespoon hungarian paprika
1 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon cumin, ground
1/8 teaspoon cayenne
1 dash allspice
1 dash cinnamon, ground
1 1/2 lb green beans, fresh, washed and trim; med

In a steeped, saute onion in olive oil on medium-low heat until golden
brown. Add garlic in the last 2-3 minutes. Add lamb cubes and saute
until brown. Add tomatoes and simmer until meat is tender. Keep an
eye on the liquid; add water or red wine if it becomes dry.

Add bay leaves, lemon juice and spices.  Simmer on low heat for at
least 2 hours.  About 1/2 hour before pronouncing it done, add the
green beans. Serve with plain yogurt and pita bread.

NOTES:

*  Fragrant lamb stew -- This recipe comes from Margo Kaiser, with
whom I used to work. It's a delicious stew, spiced fragrantly but not
hot. It's one of my favorites. It's also very easy. The most tedious
work is trimming the lamb, and you can get the butcher to take care
of that.

The spice mixture is my attempt to re-create Margo's "secret spice"
(she didn't offer that recipe).  Feel free to try your own
variations. If you hit on one that you feel is particularly good,
please let me know about it. Yield:  serves 6 to 8.

*  I prefer to cook to the point of simmering, refrigerate overnight,
and then finish cooking the next evening. This greatly enhances the
flavor. When you take the stew from the refrigerator, skim any lamb
fat that has congealed on the top before continuing.

*  I find that many butchers don't understand that I want good
quality meat in stews. I get better quality, more carefully trimmed
meat by telling them that I want lamb cubes cut for shish kebab.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours cooking.
: Precision:  measure the spices.

Marty Feins' Egg Drop Soup

chinese, soup/stew

1 x no ingredients

A simple and good egg drop soup is simply some very rich chicken
soup..

Some cornstarch to slightly thicken, like maybe a tsp, dissolved in a
little stock, added to for each bowl of soup, bring to a simmer, add
the cornstarch mixture when soup simmers. Add a little soy, very
little to taste. While soup is on low boil, beat an egg or two,
slowly dibble into the soup and stir quickly. Season to taste.

To make 'Egg Flower' soup, do the same, but when adding the eggs,
pour heavier down a fork right into the 'boiling' soup. Don't stir
until egg coagulates.
The egg will 'flower' up and look nice...

Maryland Crab Soup

4 cup water
2  12 oz cans tomatoes, minced
1/2 large onion, chopped
2  carrots, sliced
1 can sweet corn
1/2 lb string beans, cut into 1 inch piece; s
1  hot pepper, minced
1  old bay seasoning, to taste
1 lb crabmeat

Put everything but the crabmeat into a large pot and bring to a boil.
Cover and simmer, adding crabmeat, for about 2 hours. Don't buy the
lump crabmeat, it's a waste. I used leftover crabmeat and clawmeat,
which gives it a bit more sweetness. If you're buying crabmeat, it's
probably best to by 1/2 lb each of claw and backfin.

Matzoh Ball Soup

soups

2 tablespoon melted fat or oil
2 large eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 cup matzo meal
1 teaspoon salt (optional)
2 tablespoon soup stock or water

Blend fat, or oil, and eggs together.  Add matzo meal and salt
mixture to egg and blend well.  Then add soup stock or water and mix
until uniform. Cover mixing bowl and place in refrigerator for 15
minutes. Using a two or three quart pot bring 1 1/2 quarts of
slightly salted water (no salt if desired) to a brisk boil. Reduce
flame, and into the slightly boiling water drop balls approximately 1
inch in diameter formed from mixture from refrigerator. Cover pot and
cook 30 to 40 minutes. Have soup at room temperature, or warmer, and
remove matzo balls from water and place in soup pot. When ready to
serve, allow soup to simmer for about 5 minutes. Makes about eight
balls.

Oh yes, the soup.  Any chicken or vegetable soup, Kosher Shel Pesach,
will do fine.  I prefer the vegetable. My favorite Jewish cuisine
book is "Jewish Cookery", by Leah H. Leonard. I'm sorry this is too
late for your Pesach Seder.

Mct's Conch Chowder

soup/stew, potatoes, fish/shellfish

2 large onions, diced
1  bell pepper, diced
2 large potatoes, peeled & cubed
6 oz bacon, cut in 1/4 dice
1  15 oz. can tomato puree
1  8 oz. bottle clam juice
1  8 oz. can diced tomatoes in
1  juice
2 lb conch or clams, diced (see
1  note)
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon thyme, use fresh if
1  available
2 teaspoon black pepper
1  bay leaf, crushed
2 oz hot sauce or salsa (see
1  note)
1  jalapeno pepper, finely
1  diced

Saute bacon until soft-cooked; add green peppers and onion to skillet
and saute to al dente stage. Place in a large pot and add tomato
puree, diced tomatoes, clam juice, salt, pepper, bay leaf, thyme,
potatoes, jalapeno, hot sauce, and conch.  Bring to a low boil for 15
minutes, then simmer for 1 hour.  To hold until serving time, cool to
room temp- erature and refrigerate.

NOTE:  At McT's, the diced conch meat is marinated overnight in papaya
juice to tenderize it.  The papaya juice can be rinsed off with a
little left in to give a slight sweet flavor to the chowder. NOTE:
The resaurant uses Pico Pica hot sauce, usually only available to the
trade, but La Victoria hot salsa, which is more available, may be
substituted, Buchholz says.

From McT's Shrimp House and Tavern, 1523 Periwinkle Way, Sanibel
Island, FL.  General Manager Ron Buchholz figured out a home-size
version of McT's Conch Chowder. Recipe supplied by Lillian Austin,
former Food Editor of the Ft. Myers News Press from a cookbook she

stews

2 lb minced pork
1 tablespoon fat
1 each onion
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon cloves
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
3 pint water
1/2 cup browned flour

Mix the seasonings with the meat in a large bowl, add the onion,
browned in the fat. Work the mixture with the hands to make sure the
seasonings are well distributed .Look over your stock of spices and
use your imagination.remember that no one spice should predominate.
Shape the meat into 1 1/2 inch balls and flour them lightly. Drop
them into 3 pints of boiling water and cook slowly for 1 1/2 hours.
At the end of this time thicken the stock with 1/2 cup of browned
flour. Browned flour may be added directly to stock without being
mixed to a paste if the stock is boiling there will be no lumps. The
stock will jell when cool and your ragout de boulettes will keep for
some time.

Medieval Italian Stew (Pie In A Pipkin)

beef, fruits, italian, stews

3 lb stew beef; cut in 1/2 cubes
2 medium onions; chopped
1  cooking oil
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 teaspoon each cloves and cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon each nutmeg, mace and pepper
1 tablespoon white vinegar; or to taste
1  salt; to taste

Brown the beef in a skillet in a small quantity of oil. Place browned
beef *and its juices* in a stewpot. Add more oil (if necessary) to
the skillet; saute onions until tender and translucent.  Add onions
to stewpot. Add raisins and spices to the meat mixture, along with a
small quantity of water (approximately 1/2 cup). There should be just
enough water to prevent scorching and to help form the gravy.

Bring stew to a boil and reduce immediately to a simmer. Simmer,
covered, until meat is tender (about 1-1/2 to 2 hours). Stir
occasionally. Add water as necessary. When beef is cooked, add
vinegar and salt. Cook a few minutes more.

Carroll-Mann wrote: "This is a recipe I adapted from a 16th century
translation of a medieval Italian cookbook. The recipe is called "Pie
in a Pipkin" which means (crustless) meat pie in a stewpot. It has a
nice thick gravy and a sweet/tart flavor."

Mediterran Tomato Soup With Pasta

pasta, soups, vegetables, vegetarian

4 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, minced
2 1/2 lb ripe tomatoes, cut in large
1  dice
4 large garlic cloves, chopped
2 cup chicken stock or any broth
1 1/4 cup water
1 1/4 teaspoon dried leaf oregano crumbled
1  salt and freshly ground
1  pepper to taste
1 cup small pasta, such as thimble
1  shaped ditali (salad
1  macaroni)
2 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh basil
1  bowl of freshly grated
1  parmesan cheese (for serving
1  if desired)

Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion and
cook, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes or until soft but not
brown. Add tomatoes, garlic, stock, water, oregano, salt, and pepper;
bring to a boil.  Cover and cook over low heat
45    minutes.

Puree soup in a food mill; or puree in a food processor and strain,
pressing so pulp goes through strainer. (Soup can be kept, covered, 2
days in a refrigerator.) Return soup to saucepan and reheat. If soup
appears thin, simmer uncovered 2-3 minutes to thicken slightly.

Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and add salt. Just before
serving add pasta and cook uncovered over high heat, stirring
occasionally, 5-8 minutes or until tender but firm to the bite. Drain
well. Add to soup.

Stir in 1 tablespoon basil.  Taste and adjust seasoning. Sprinkle with
remaining 1 tablespoon basil. Serve with parmesan cheese, if desired.

NOTE: Made this only when you have very ripe tomatoes ~ they are the
soul of this soup while the ditali, or pasta thimbles, give it body.
The soup is relatively easy to prepare because there is no need to
peel or seed the tomatoes.   After cooking, they are pureed in either
a food mill or food processor.  A garnish of tomato slices nad basil
sprigs looks very attractive.

This recipe came from a friends pasta cookbook.  It is great!!!

Melokhia (Egyptian Herb Soup)

soups, vegetarian, egyptian

125 gm dried melokhia leaves -=or=-
1 kg fresh melokhia leaves*
1 1/2 liter strong stock
1  salt
1  black pepper
25 gm olive oil
3 each garlic cloves, crushed
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Crush the dried Melokhia leaves. Put them in a bowl and moisten with a
little hot water. Set aside until they swell and double in bulk. If
the leaves are not brittle enough to crumble, dry them out in a warm
oven for a few minutes. If fresh leaves are being used, wash them
thoroughly and cut off the stalks. Spread the leaves out on a clean
cloth to dry. Chop them finely.

Put the stock in a large saucepan (you can use any stock, except
pork). Season with salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Add the
chopped or crumbled leaves and simmer for 10 minutes if the leaves
are fresh and for 30 minutes if dry.

Meanwhile, prepare the "Taklia" or garlic sauce. Melt the butter in a
small frying-pan. Add the garlic and fry, stirring, until it is
golden brown. Add the coriander and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 2
minutes. Add the garlic mixture to the soup, cover the pan, and
simmer for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust the seasoning and
serve.

* "Melokhia is a soup made from an Egyptian herb similar to spinach.
It is one of the national dishes of Egypt. Melokhia leaves are
available dried from Greek shops, and occasionally the fresh leaves
are available in some markets." If you can't get Melokhia, try this
recipe with spinach. Works for me!

Minestra Di Riso Per Pesach

holiday, italian, jewish, mine

2  chicken breast halves boneless
1  egg; slightly beaten
1/4 cup matza meal*
2 teaspoon broth or; water salt
1 dash cinnamon or nutmeg
2 1/2 quart chicken broth
1/2 cup rice; uncooked
8  eggs, small; hard boiled

Passover Chicken Soup with Rice      *matza meal is available at some
supermarkets and Jewish grocery stores

"I did not learn of the traditional matza ball soup served during the
first two nights of Passover until I came to this country. Our
classic soup was a chicken soup with rice to which were added balls
of chicken breast and whole immature eggs (which are still at the
stage where the outer shell and white have not yet formed; they are
perfectly round and vary from less than 1" to less than 1 mm in
diameter.) It was a beautiful soup to look at, with the white rice,
the golden meat balls, the orange eggs (from chickens raised on
private farms ...)...Here in America I could never find immature
eggs, so I replace them with hard boiled egg yolks.

Grind or finely chop the chicken broth. In a bowl, combine the beaten
egg with matza meal and 2 Tbsp of water or broth. Mix well; add
ground chicken, salt, spices and mix well again. Set aside to rest in
the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. Shape the mixture into tiny
balls, no larger than the egg yolks. Bring the broth to a boil; add
rice, chicken balls and cook, covered for 15-20 minutes. Peel eggs,
discard whites and place one hard boiled egg yolk in each of the
eight bowls. Pour the soup over the egg yolks and serve immediately.

Battuto:  Chop to a paste your seasonings, celery, onion, carrot and
sage along with the lean salt pork.  Chop all these coarsely, and
then keep chopping until everything is reduced to a paste.  Blenders
don't seem to do too well with this combination of pork and celery,
so they are not recommended.  When the battuto is ready, saute it in
the olive oil in a big soup pot.  Once the battuto is golden, the
minestrone is on its way. Soup: Add to the pot the hot water and the
salt, raise the heat to high. Chop the celery, carrots and 2 of the
potatoes into 1/4" bits, break the cauliflower into small pieces,
preserving as much as possible the individual flowerets. Put these 4
vegetables to boil in the flavored water for 10 minutes, while you
prepare the other vegetables: slice the third potato with a potato
peeler into paper-thin slices, and add them to the pot. Chop the
zucchini in half, then quarters, then slice into 1/2" bits. Cut the
cabbage into thin slices and then into 1/8" bits.  Break the
escarole, endive, and spinach into 1/2" pieces.  Slice the onion into
slivers.  Add these, the tomatoes and the peas to the boiling pot,
lower the heat, and let bubble along for about 15 minutes.  If you
wish, add 1 cup of rice at this time, to make a northern variation,
or a cup of small macaroni to make a southern version.  At the end of
15 minutes, or when all the vegetables are done, add the garbanzos,
mashing some of them as you stir them in. Cook for another 15 to 25
minutes, depending on how thick you wish your soup. The real
minestrone has a nice, thick consistency, although some prefer it
thinner.  Serve hot in winter with a slice of toasted (even better,
fried) Italian bread in the bottom of the soup plate and a sprinkling
of Parmesan cheese on top. Serve at room temperature without the
bread in summer. From The Romagnolis' Table by Margaret & G. Franco
Romagnoli.

Minestrone Di Romagna

italian

1/2 cup olive oil
3 tablespoon butter
1 cup yellow onion, thinly sliced
1 cup carrots, diced
1 cup celery, diced
2 cup potatoes, peeled & diced
1 1/2 cup fresh white beans (if available) or
1 1/2 cup canned cannellini beans
2 cup zucchini, diced
1 cup green beans, diced
3 cup cabbage, shredded (preferably savoy; cabbage)
6 cup homemade beefbroth or
2 cup canned beef broth mixed w/
4 cup water
2/3 cup canned italian tomatoes, with their; juice
1/3 cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated

Choose a stockpot large enough for all the ingredients. Put in the
oil, butter and sliced onion and cook over medium low heat until the
onion wilts and is pale gold in color but not browned. Add the diced
carrots and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring once or twice. repeat

this procedure with the celery, potatoes, white beans (if fresh),
zucchini, and green beans, cooking each one a few minutes before
adding the next. Then add the cabbage and cook for about 6 minutes,
giving the pot an occasional stir.

Add the broth, the tomatoes and their juice and a little bit of salt.
(go easy on the salt, especially if you are using canned broth; you
can always correct the seasoning later.) Cover and cook at a slow boil
for at least 3 hours.

If necessary, you can stop the cooking and resume it later on.
(Minestrone must never be thin and watery, so cook until it is soupy
thick. If you should find that it has become to thick, you can add
another cup of homemade broth or water. Do NOT add more canned broth.)
15 minutes before the soup is done, add the canned or cooked dry beans
(if you are not using fresh ones). Just before turning off the heat,
swirl in the grated cheese, then taste and correct for salt.

Minestrone soup is even better when warmed up the next day. It keeps
up to a week in the refrigerator.

Miso Soup

japanese, vegetarian

4 cup water
1  inch piece of kombu, rinsed
1  handful of hijiki, wakame,
1  arame - your choice
1  tub of white wave lowfat
1  tofu
1  onion coarsely chopped
2  carrots sliced
1/8  to 1/4 cup miso paste (i
1  like the brown best)

Rinse the kombu (kelp; you can get it in health food stores in the
Macrobiotic section or in an Asian market) and put it in the water in
a large pot.  Add the seaweed(s) of your choice. I always add wakame;
hijiki tastes too strong for some people, but I love that too. Bring
to a boil.

While you're boiling the water, you can water, saute the onion, or
just throw it into the water when it's almost at a boil. Turn the
heat way down and add the carrots and the tofu.

Put the miso into a bowl.  Pour some of the water from the pot over
it (you kill some of the miso's good stuff if you boil it, so you
shouldn't put it into the boiling water). Stir the miso thoroughly
into the water and then add this back to the pot. Miso is really high
in sodium, so you can adjust how much you add to taste.  My
macrobiotic cookbook says 1 tsp. per cup of water, but that tastes
_really_ light to me.

Remove the kombu piece (it's the tough one) and serve.  I put brown
rice in mine, since I don't like to eat brown rice plain.

This soup has all kinds of items that the macrobiotic people say will
cure you of cancer (thinking of an older digest question). Both miso
and the seaweed are supposed to be excellent for your health
according to Michio Kushi, et al.  YMMV.

Miso Soup With Chicken & Vegetables

japanese, soups

6 cup dashi (soup stock)
1/4 cup chicken breast
1/2 cup carrots; finely chopped
1 cup potatoes; finely diced
2  scallions; chopped finely
1/2 cup miso (bean paste)
1  sansho (japanese pepper),
1  minced,
1  dashi (soup stock)
1  (optional)
1  nori (japanese seaweed)
5 cup water
1 cup flaked dry bonito
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon soy sauce

In a saucepan, bring the dashi to a boil.  Remove the chicken from
the bone and dice.  Add the vegetables and the chicken to the stock
and cook low, until tender. Add the miso and cook gently another 5
minutes. Remove from heat and pour into soup bowls. Sansho may be
added when serving. Rinse the nori well and place in the water in a
saucepan. Bring to a boil quickly and remove the nori.  Add the
bonito to the still boiling broth, then remove from heat immediately
and let stand about 2 minutes. Strain through a clean cloth and
season with salt and soy sauce.

Judi's Notes:

1) Dashi is a fish stock that is light and clear used in Japanese
cooking as a soup base.

2) The recipe does not specify how much Nori (seaweed) to use. It
states a quantity of 1.  Try using a 5-inch piece from a sheet of
Nori and if that is weak put in more.

1 1/2 cup warm water
1 oz dried shiitake mushrooms
1 lb mushrooms
4 tablespoon butter
1/3 cup shallots, coarsely chopped
1 small carrot, diced
1 large celery stalk, diced
1/4 lb potatoes peeled and diced
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
2 cup cooked wild rice
4 cup chicken stock
1  salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 cup light cream
1  few drops tabasco sauce
3 tablespoon madeira wine
1  snipped chives (opt)

In a small bowl, pour the warm water over the dried mushrooms,
weighting them down so that the mushrooms are completely submerged;
soak for 30 minutes. cut off and discard the tough stems. Squeeze
excess liquid from the mushrooms back into the soaking liquid, then
strain the liquid through a dampened coffee filter to get rid of any
fine grit. Slice the mushrooms and set them aside along with the
liquid.

Wipe the cultivated mushrooms with dampened paper towels, t rim off
the stems and slice the mushrooms thickly. Set aside.

In a 7-qt. Dutch oven, melt the butter and saut‚ the shallots over
medium heat, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Add both kinds of
mushrooms and saut‚, stirring, for about 5 minutes. Add the cooked
rice along with the reserved mushroom liquid and the chicken stock.
Bring to a boil, lower the heat, season with salt and pepper to taste
and stir in the tomato paste. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.

Pur‚e in batches in a blender or food processor; the soup should not
be too smooth. Return soup to the same pot, stir in the cream and
reheat on low heat. Stir in the Tabasco sauce and the wine; adjust
seasoning. SErve hot, topped with a few snipped chives, if desired.

1 teaspoon salt
4 oz crab meat or
1  2 crabs; cooked and cut into piece
5 tablespoon oil
8 cup ; water
2 teaspoon salt
1 lb rice vermicelli*
1 lb fresh bean sprouts
1 large cucumber; peeled and coarsely grate
8  spring onions (scallions)
1/2 cup fresh mint leaves; firmly packed
1  soup
2 medium onions; quartered; finely sliced
2 centiliter garlic; finely chopped
2 teaspoon grated lemon rind; finely chopped
2 teaspoon laos powder**
8  candlenuts; finely grated***
6  dried chillies; seeds removed
2 teaspoon dried shrimp paste (blacan)
2 teaspoon ground turmeric
4 teaspoon ground coriander
1  prawn stock with seafood see above
8 cup coconut milk
2 teaspoon sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon salt; or to taste

*  This is also known as rice sticks and is available in Chinese
groceries. ** A very delicate spice sold in powder form. Also known
as kha in Thai cooking. Available in Asian groceries. ***A hard nut
with lots of oil used to flavor curries.  Also known as kemiri
(Indonesian) or buah keras (Malay). Available in Asian groceries.

Shell and devein prawns, reserving shells and heads. Drain these
thoroughly.  Remove any bones and skin from fish fillets and using a
chopper, chop very finely. Mix in the salt and pepper and shape into
small balls, or into a sausage-shaped roll and divide into
finger-width slices. Pick over crab meat and discard any bony tissue,
or chop the whole crabs into pieces after removing top shell and
fibrous tissue.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a saucepan and when very hot throw in the
prawn heads and shells and fry until they turn bright red. Add 8 cups
water and 2 teaspoons salt, cover and simmer 20-30 minutes, then
strain. Discard shells and heads.  Return the stock to the fire, drop
in the fish balls or slices and the prawns, cut into pieces if large.
Return to the boil, then lower heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes.  Set
aside and keep warm.

Scald the rice vermicelli by pouring boiling water over it, then
allow it to drain in a colander.  Or soak it in warm water for 5-10
minutes, drain well. Scald the bean sprouts by pouring boiling water
over. Rinse in cold water, washing off any loose skins. Pinch off
straggly brown "tails." Slice spring onions finely, roughly chop mint
leaves. Set aside each ingredient separately] until serving time.

TO MAKE THE SOUP:  Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil and fry the
onions, garlic, and lemon rind until onions are golden. Stir in the
laos powder, candlenuts, chillies, blacan, turmeric and coriander.
Add the prawn stock and when the soup comes to the boil add the
coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for
10-15 minutes, stirring to prevent coconut milk curdling.

In each bowl, arrange a ladle of the vermicelli, enough to two-thirds
fill the bowl.  Add a handful of bean sprouts, a tablespoon each of
cucumber, and sliced spring onions. Add also a large pinch of mint.
Pour the boiling soup over and serve immediately.  A hot sambal can
be served along with this for individuals to add to their portion if
desired. Serves 8-10. Source:  The Complete Asian Cookbook.
