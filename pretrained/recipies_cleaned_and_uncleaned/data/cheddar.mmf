    1/2 t  Sweet paprika
    1/2 t  Black pepper
    1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves
    1/2 t  Sweet basil
    1/2 t  Gumbo file (optional)

------------------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS------------------------------
      3    Slices bacon, diced
  1 1/2 c  Onions, chopped very fine
      1 c  Green bell peppers, chopped
    1/4 lb + 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
    3/4 t  White pepper
    3/4 t  Ground cayenne pepper
    1/2 lb Small shrimp
  1 1/2 c  Basic seafood stock
      6    Shucked oysters (med. size)
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Green onions, chopped fine
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese

---------------------------FLOUNDER SEASONING MIX---------------------------
      2 t  Salt
      1 t  Sweet paprika
    1/2 t  White pepper
    1/2 t  Onion powder
    1/2 t  Garlic powder
    1/2 t  Dry mustard
    1/4 t  Ground cayenne pepper
    1/4 t  Dried thyme leaves
    1/4 t  Dried sweet basil leaves
      6    Flounders (see note)
  1 1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
           Vegetable oil for frying
 
  NOTE: Flounder should be 1 to 1-1/4 pounds each,
  boned, heads removed and brown side split down the
  center. Combine the first seasoning mix ingredients in
  a small bowl; mix well and set aside. In a large
  skillet fry the bacon over high heat until crisp. Add
  onions, celery and bell peppers. Stir well and saute
  until vegetables start to get tender, about 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally. Add 3 tablespoons of the butter
  and the white and red peppers; stir until butter is
  melted. Stir in the shrimp and the first seasoning
  mix. Continue cooking for about 3 to 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally and scraping pan bottom well.
  Stir in the stock and the oysters; cook and stir about
  6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Use a slotted spoon
  to spoon the seafood vegetable mixture into a food
  processor or blender, leaving the liquid in the
  skillet; process mixture until smooth, about 15 to 30
  seconds. Return mixture to skillet, stirring to blend
  with liquid; turn heat to high, and cook until mixture
  starts sticking excessively, about 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally and scraping pan bottom well. Remove from
  heat. Meanwhile, in a 1-quart saucepan melt the
  remaining 6 tablespoons butter over high heat; when
  almost melted, remove from heat, then add 1/4 cup of
  the flour and stir until mixture is smooth. Return to
  high heat for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Turn heat
  to high under the stuffing mixture; gradually add the
  butter-flour mixture, stirring constantly until well
  blended. If mixture starts "weeping" oil at this
  point, stir in about 2 tablespoons more stock or
  water.) Continue cooking until very thick, about 1 to
  2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the green onions
  and cook 1 minute more, stirring constantly. Remove
  from heat and stir in the Parmesan. Cool slightly,
  then refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes. In a
  small bowl thoroughly combine the flounder seasoning
  mix ingredients. Open the flounders for stuffing.
  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon ofthe seasoning mix on the
  inside of each flouner. Mound 1/4 cup of the cheddar
  cheese in the center of each, then spoon a scant 1/2
  cup chilled stuffing on top of the cheese. Close the
  fish so the stuffing doesn't show. Cover and
  refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of
  the seasoning mix on each side of each chilled
  flounder, patting it in with your hands. In a pan
  (cake and pie pans work well) combine the remaining
  seasoning mix with the remaining 1/2 cup flour. In a
  large, heavy skillet heat 1/4 inch oil over high heat
  to about 350F. Meanwhile, place each flounder (split
  side up) in the seasoned flour to coat only the bottom
  surface. Carefully slide each flounder into the hot
  oil and fry the bottom until it's crispy, crunchy and
  brown-brown!-- about 3 to 4 minutes. Without draining,
  place the flounder, still split side up, on an
  ungreased cooke sheet. Bake at 550F until the fish are
  cooked and well browned on top, about 10 minutes
  (after about 4 minutes, drape a piece of aluminum foil
  over the tails so they won't burn). Serve immediately
  as is, or topped with Hollandaise Sauce, Shrimp and
  Crab Buttercream Sauce, or Bearnaise Sauce

     12    Eggs; separated
      4 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
      2 c  Fresh or frozen corn kernels
      1 c  Milk
      2    Fresh jalapeno peppers
           - seeds & membranes removed

      1 ts Salt; or to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
      6 c  Purchased or homemade salsa,
           - warmed
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch oven-proof glass or earthenware
  casserole dish. Make an incision along the length of each bell pepper and
  remove the stem, seeds and membranes, keeping the peppers whole. Fill a
  medium-size saucepan or skillet halfway with water and bring it to a boil.
  Add the peppers, let the water return to a boil and cook until the peppers
  are just softened, about 3 minutes. Remove and blot them very dry with
  paper towels. Let them cool completely and then line the bottom of the
  casserole with them. Separate the eggs into 2 large bowls. Beat the yolks
  until smooth, then stir in the cheese, corn, milk, jalapeno peppers and
  salt and black pepper. Whisk the whites until soft peaks form, then fold
  them into the yolk mixture, gently stirring just until almost blended.
  Scrape the mixture into the prepared dish and transfer it to the middle
  rack of the preheated oven. Bake just until the eggs are puffy and the top
  is lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325F and continue
  cooking until the eggs are baked through but not dry, 22 to 25 minutes.
  Test by inserting a knife into the center. It should come out almost clean.
  Remove the pan and let it sit for a few minutes before cutting the
  casserole into 12 rectangles. Serve each portion with some salsa spooned on
  top.

  the skin of each breast, dredge each breast in flour and shake off the
  excess. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat on the stove. When
  the oil is hot enough for frying (350F), dip each breast in the beer batter
  and let the excess run off. Place skin-side down in the oil and fry until
  golden. Turn and fry other side, about 1 minute per side. Remove breasts
  from the oil as they are done, drain on paper towels and transfer to a
  baking dish. Place the chicken breasts in a preheated 375F oven for 15
  minutes. Place tomato sauce in a saucepan and reheat. (If the mixture is

      Title: RED LOBSTER'S CHEESY GARLIC ROLLS
 Categories: Breads, Garlic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Baking mix (RL uses a
           -specially made product, but
           -Bisquick buttermilk baking
           -mix is a decent substitute)
      6 oz Grated mild cheddar cheese
     21 oz Cold water
 
  Mix together above ingredients (by hand, an electric mixer will NOT work)
  until JUST combined --do not overmix.  Scoop with a 1 1/2 ounce scoop onto
  2 parchment-lined baking sheets (20 per sheet), and bake in a 450
  convection oven for 4-5 minutes.  Rotate the sheets, and bake another 4-5
  minutes.  (Note, a commercial convection oven cooks about 25 percent faster
  than a home oven -- for the same results, increase the baking time
  somewhat, but be careful not to overbrown the rolls, they should be a light
  golden brown). Remove rolls from the oven, and brush with garlic butter
  mixture (again, RL uses a proprietary product, but you can make a decent
  imitation by adding garlic powder, NOT salt) to taste, plus some dehydrated
  parsley flakes to liquid margarine. Do not add too much butter to the
  rolls, or the garlic flavor will overpower the cheese. For variations,
  increase the cheese to 8 oz. (better, and the way the Lobster used to do
  it), or substitute about 5 oz. shredded Parmesan (NOT the dried stuff that
  comes in a can) for the cheddar.  The Parmesan variation is excellent.
  IMHO, better than the original. As a breakfast bread (or snack for the
  cook), you may also add 4-5 slices of crisp cooked bacon to this. In this
  case, brush with regular liquid margarine instead of garlic butter.

      2    Eggs, at room temperature
      6 oz Bottled beer or ale
    3/4 lb Cheddar cheese, coarse shred
  1 1/2 T  Butter or margarine
    3/4 t  Dry mustard
    3/4 t  Worcestershire sauce
    1/8 t  Tabasco sauce

------------------------------------BASE------------------------------------
      2 sl Homebaked Bread, toasted
      4 sl Black Forest Ham

-----------------------------VEGETABLE FILLING-----------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Watercress, fresh
    1/4 c  Green Pepper, julienne

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
           Tomato slices, thin
 
  1. Beat eggs until well blended.
  2. Stir remaining sauce ingredients, together with the eggs, in a
  double-boiler. The type of beer used is a personal preference. A variety
  beer such as an imported German, British, etc beer is recommended so as to
  make the recipe less ordinary. A Pilsener or Lager may add more foam to
  the mixture and make the rarebit lighter in texture.
  3. Bring a double-boiler to the boil then reduce heat to medium to heat
  mixture. Leave mixture uncovered and stir mixture thoroughly about once
  every minute.
  4. When the desired consistency is achieved, Beat mixture with rotary
  beater or electric mixer until very smooth. Leave in double-boiler to
  maintain temperature.
  5. Toast bread slices. Home-made bread, sliced slightly thicker than
  commercial bread, is preferrable. Variety home-made breads would vary
  texture and flavour.
  6. Drape 1 to 2 slices of Black Forest Ham (or alternative delicatessen
  meat slices) over toasted bread. Place on dinner plate and set in warming
  oven approx 10 min. prior to serving.
  7. Steam watercress with julienne green peppers until heated through.
  These vegetables should be as close to uncooked as possible, although
  heated. Microwave may be utilized (approx 2 min at high). Wild watercress
  would enhance flavour.
  8. Mound a portion of watercress and green pepper in the middle of the ham
  slices on the serving plates. Ladle a generous amount of the rarebit over
  the vegetables, ham and toast - allowing it to flow to cover the plate
  bottom. Accent plate by dropping thinly sliced uncooked tomato on the top
  of each mound.

    1/2 ts Dried thyme
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
      6 tb Grated Parmesan Cheese

  2.  In small skillet heat olive oil and saute onion
    until translucent, about 5 minutes.
  
  3.  In large bowl combine zucchini, carrot, broccoli,
    oatmeal, breadcrumbs, oat bran and cheese.
  
  4.  In small bowl beat together tomato sauce, egg and
    egg white, seasonings and Parmesan.
  
  5.  Combine all ingredients and stir thoroughly to mix.

  Why the sudden interest in oat bran?  Oat bran is the fibrous outer layer
  of the oat grain, which is generally removed when the grain is processed
  into oatmeal. Now that we know the importance of fiber in a well balanced
  diet, it is a good practice to put some of that oat bran back into our
  food.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 ts Garlic salt or powder
      1 tb Parsley flakes
      1 ts Italian seasonings
      5 lb Bisquick
     44 oz Cold water
      1 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -sharp,grated
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by large
  spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes. After baking,
  (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed with garlic powder,
  parsley flakes and italian seasoning. (Amounts will vary by the size batch
  you make, but a little goes a long way.) Serve hot.
  
  The Red Lobster manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll have to
  reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you desire. Note: For a
  smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2 cup cold water, and 3/4 c.
  grated cheddar which will yield about 12 biscuits.
  
  You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the water, if desired.

  Souffle de Chou-Fleur
  The fertile plains around Lac St. Jean produces excellent vegetables and
  supports thriving dairy farms. A strong cheddar cheese, made at St. Prime
  on the west side of the lake and aged up to 4 years, is one of the region's
  finest cheeses. Adele Coperman-Langevin of St. Fulhence combines
  cauliflower from her market garden in her souffle.
  
    Cook cauliflower in boiling, salted water until tender, drain well and
  mash. Melt butter in medium saucepan, blend in flour and cook, stirring
  over medium heat until bubbly; do not let mixture brown.
    Meanwhile, bring milk to a boil in another saucepan. Add hot milk to
  butter-flour mixture and cook, stirring over medium heat until sauce
  thickens  and is smooth. Season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
  Remove from heat.
    Lightly beat egg yolks and stir into sauce. Then stir in cheese and
  cauliflower until smooth. In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but
  not dry. Fold cauliflower mixture gently but thoroughly into beaten egg
  whites. Pour into a buttered 2 quart (2 L) souffle dish. Bake in preheated
  350F oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or till puffed, firm and lightly browned.
  Serve at once. SERVES: 4-6

     12    Flour tortillas (12-in.)
           Shredded Monterey Jack
           Shredded cheddar cheese
 
  Place meat in Dutch oven. Add 1 gallon water and bring to boil. Reduce heat
  and simmer, covered, until meat is half-cooked, about 35 minutes. Drain off
  water. Add onions, bell peppers, cilantro, tomatoes, garlic powder, salt,
  cumin, cloves, pepper, bay leaves and chile to meat and simmer. Remove
  husks from tomatillos and boil in saucepan in 1 quart water until tender,
  about 15 minutes. Drain off water. Mash tomatillos, add to meat mixture and
  simmer, stirring constantly 15 minutes. Add lemon juice. Stir cornstarch
  mixture then stir into meat mixture and simmer 15 minutes longer, stirring
  constantly. Heat tortillas gently until softened (heat 1 at a time directly
  on burner of range or wrap in foil and place in 350F oven a few minutes).
  To make burritos, place heaping 1/2 cup meat mixture on each tortilla. Fold
  sides in, then roll up from one end. Sprinkle burritos generously with
  cheese and place under broiler just until cheese melts.

      Title: VEGETABLE FINGER SALAD
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables, Breads
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      2 pk Pillsbury Crescent Rolls
      2 pk Cream cheese - 8 oz. each
      1 c  Mayonnaise
      1 pk Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing
           Mix (original recipe - dry)
    1/2 c  Chopped green pepper
    1/2 c  Chopped carrots
    1/2 c  Chopped broccoli
    1/2 c  Shredded cheddar cheese
 
  Press out in one piece without separation 2 packages Pillsbury Crescent
  Rolls in jelly roll pan or cookie sheet with edge (2 pans).  Bake as
  directed on Crescent Roll package and cool.
  
  Mix together cream cheese, mayonnaise and Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing.
  Spread on cooled baked roll mix.
  
  Mix together chopped vegetables and press into cream cheese mixture.
  
  Refrigerate.  Cut into small squares.  Will keep several days in
  refrigerator.
  
  Personal Note:  This recipe makes a LOT.  I cut all ingredients in half and
  still have plenty to serve (in addition to other snack foods).  I also
  replace half the mayo with non-fat yogert, and replace the cheddar cheese
  with a fourth vegetable to cut the fat content (Still tastes delicious).
  
  The total servings will change depending on how large or small you cut each
  piece.  I only listed 24 because Meal Master requires a number. Please
  change once you make the recipe and count the pieces.  Thanks.

  [Another Note:  Now that I have typed this into the database, I see that
  nowhere in this recipe does it tell you when to add the spices -- other
  than the chili powder (which was not listed in the "ingredients,"
  originally -- I had to go back and insert that)  or what to do with the
  vegetable oil.  I assume one might mix the spices in the cooking oil and
  smear it over the chicken breast before grilling or broiling. Suggestions,
  of course, will be appreciated.  Complaints will be ignored.]

      Title: SEVEN LAYER SALAD
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2    Head of Iceburg Lettuce
           - chopped
      1 c  Clery, chopped
      1 c  Green pepper, chopped
      1    Med. onion, sliced or diced
      1    Box (10 oz.) frozen peas
      1 lb Bacon, fried and crumbled
      5    Hard boiled eggs, sliced
      2 c  Mayonaise
      2 tb Sugar
      3 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
 
  Note: The name in the family recipe book is "Seven Layer Salad." Don't ask
  me why?  It really isn't seven layers, but it has become my favorite. (BC)
  
  Using a fairly deep baking dish (I use a 4" deep 9" X 9" pyrex pan), place
  a bed of chopped lettuce on the bottom, then lay down a layer of celery,
  then onion, then green peppersm then peas, then eggs.  The order is really
  not that important, and they will nor really constitute a solid "layer."
  
  Then and another layer of lettuce and repeat the procedure.
  
  Mix mayonaise and sugar together and spread on top.
  
  Sprinkle bacon and cheddar cheese on top of the whole thing.
  
  Cover tightly and leave overnight in refrigerator, allowing mayonaise to
  permeate the whole thing.

      Title: CHEESE CRACKERS
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 c  Grated sharp cheddar cheese
    1/2 c  Flour, part for rolling
      2 tb Margarine or butter
    1/4 ts Salt
        pn Paprika
        pn Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Water
 
  Mix all together in a bowl.  Original directions suggested shaping into a
  roll 1 1/2 inch wide, chilling at least 2 hours wrapped in wax paper and
  cutting in thin slices to make 1 dozen or more crackers. This would produce
  neatly shaped crackers, possibly thicker than desired.
  
  By rolling very thin, this amount of dough will make small crackers about
  1/2 inch apart to cover 1 1/2 small cookie sheets. They do puff up while
  baking. May be cut quickly in random small shapes with a plastic knife.
  
  Suggested toppings coarse salt (made them too salty), garlic salt, celery
  salt, curry powder, or freshly ground black pepper. If the dough is very
  dry after rolling, brush tops with water before salting. If it is soft,
  sprinkle lightly and press the salt into the crackers.
  
  Bake 5 minutes at 425 F or until browned.

      Title: CHEESE AND CHILE SQUARES
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      2 oz Parmesan cheese, cut in
           -several pieces
      2    (4-ounce) cans mild or hot
           -green chiles
      4 oz Longhorn cheddar cheese,
           -chilled
     12 oz Monterey Jack cheese,
           -chilled
      1 ts Salt
           Several dashes Tabasco sauce
     10    Eggs, divided
    1/3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Melted butter
      2 c  Cottage cheese
 
  Using the metal blade, drop the Parmesan cheese pieces through the feed
  tube with the motor running and process until finely grated. Remove and set
  aside. Without washing the workbowl, use the metal blade to chop the
  chiles. Remove and set aside.
  
  Use the shredding disc to process the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses
  separately. Remove and set aside.
  
  Using the metal blade, process to combine the salt, tabasco sauce, 2 eggs,
  flour, baking powder and grated Parmesan cheese. With the machine running,
  add the hot melted butter through the feed tube. Remove the cover and add
  the cottage cheese and then process until smooth. With the machine running,
  add 3 eggs through the feed tube. Remove 2/3 of the mixture from the
  workbowl and combine with the Cheddar cheese and chiles. Add the remaining
  eggs and Monterey Jack cheese to the remaining mixture in the workbowl and
  process 20- 30 seconds.
  
  Combine the 2 mixtures and spread in a buttered 17x10 inch jelly roll pan.
  
  Bake 15 minutes in a preheated 400^ oven, then reduce temperature to 350^
  and bake about 34-40 minutes more until the cheese is set and firm. Cut
  into squares and serve warm with your favorite salsa. Makes 24 thin slices.
  
  Note: If you have a large capacity machine, all the eggs may be added at
  once and both cheeses may be added and combined in the processor bowl.
  
  This typical appetizer is usually baked in a rectangular pan and cut in
  squares. The presentation is further enhanced if accompanied by a tomato
  salsa of your choice. It should be served warm, but can be baked ahead and
  reheated.

      1 cn Whole Ortega chilies
           Monterey Jack cheese; grated
      6 oz Crab;and/or cooked and diced
    1/2 lb Very sharp cheddar cheese
           -grated
      3    Eggs
    1/4 c  Milk; please use whole milk
      1 tb Bisquick; heaping
      1 ts Flour; for dusting cheeses
 
   Drain the chilies. Plan about 4 per person. Open each chili flat. In the
  bottom of a well buttered glass oven dish; place a layer of chilies. Dust
  the jack cheese with a small amount of flour. Mix together the crab and/or
  shrimp with the Jack cheese. Place a thin layer of this mix over the bottom
  layer of chilies.
   Place another layer of chilies on top and repeat process ending with a top
  layer of chilies.
  
   Cook in a 375*F oven for 7-10 minutes; uncovered.
   Remove from oven and reduce heat to 300*F. Mix together the batter--you
  may have to double the batter to be sure you cover the dish well--and pour
  over the chilies. Add the cheddar cheese and cook, COVERED, slowly in a
  300*F oven until done. You will know it is done when a knife inserted in
  the middle comes out relatively clean. If the center does not set up
  completely after about 30 minutes, don't worry just serve it up with a
  salad and, I like corn with it.

      Title: RED LOBSTER GARLIC CHEESE ROLLS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     16 oz Very finely shredded
           -Cheddar cheese
      6 c  Water
      5 lb Box of Bisquick Mix
           -Garlic butter,
           -soft or melted
 
  Mix together cheese, water and Bisquick in a large bowl. Drop onto a
  non-stick cookie sheet or one that is covered with aluminum foil. You will
  need to experiment with size but they should turn out to be about the size
  of a normal biscuit (about 2" in diameter??). Bake at 400 degrees until
  golden (sorry, don't have the cooking time. Perhaps the Bisquick box can
  help).  Right after you remove the rolls from the oven, spread or brush
  VERY GENEROUSLY with garlic butter (soft or melted butter with lots of
  finely diced or crushed garlic mixed in). Serve rolls warm.
  
  Note:  I have no idea how many rolls this makes so you may want to cut it
  down unless you plan on feeding a herd!

      Title: WELSH RAREBIT
 Categories: Main dish, Cheese/eggs, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 c  Grated sharp cheddar cheese
      6 fl Beer; at room temperature
      2    Egg yolks; beaten
    1/8 ts Cayenne
      1 ts Dijon mustard
    3/4 c  Walnuts
      2    Apples
     16    Broccoli spears
      8 sl Bread
 
  Heat the grated cheese in the top of a double boiler. Mix the warm beer
  with the beaten egg yolks.  When the cheese has melted, slowly stir in the
  egg-beer mixture. Add the cayenne and mustard. Stir until smooth.
  
  Chop and toast the walnuts.  Slice the apples thinly. Steam the broccoli
  spears until tender but still bright. Toast the bread.
  
  For each serving of rarebit, start with two slices of toast. The general
  idea is to cover the toast with broccoli and apples, pour cheese sauce over
  them, and top with walnuts. However, I like to put apple slices between two
  slices of toast, top with broccoli spears, cover with cheese, and garnish
  with nuts.

      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 lb Cheddar cheese; grated
 
  Cook and season chicken.  Save 1-1/2 quarts broth.  Cook spaghetti in
  broth; drain, but do not rinse.  In dutch oven or heavy pan; saute pepper,
  onion, celery and mushrooms in butter.  Add tomatoes.  Simmer for about 15
  minutes to let the flavors blend.  Add spaghetti, chicken and cheese. Let
  simmer for another 15 or 20 minutes until cheese melts and everything is
  bubbly.
  
  Note: Flavors blend better if this is prepared a day ahead of time and
  refrigerated.
  
  I have also had this made with velveeta, but I MUCH prefer the cheddar
  cheese.  Have also seen variations that have english peas.  You can really
  add more or less of the various vegetables to suit your taste. This
  particular version has evolved in our kitchen over the last dozen years. I
  also prefer it made with macaroni instead of spaghetti but I've never seen
  anyone else make it that way.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           1 1/2 POUND LOAF (1 pound)
      2 ts Active dry yeast (1 1/2 ts)
  3 1/2 ts Sugar (2 1/2 ts)
    1/4 c  Chopped ham pieces (3 tb)
    1/2 c  Grated Swiss cheese (1/4 c)
  2 1/2 tb Dehydrated minced onion 5 ts
    3/4 c  Grated cheddar cheese (1/2 c
  1 1/2 ts Paprika (1 ts)
  2 1/2 tb Grated parmesan cheese 5 ts
      1 ts Dry mustard (1/2 ts)
    1/2 ts Salt (1/4 ts)
  2 1/2 c  Bread flour (1 3/4 c)
  2 1/2 tb Butter (5 ts)
      7 oz Warm milk (4 1/2 oz)
 
  NOTES: For Panasonic/National machines, use 3 tsp yeast for the 1 1/2 pound
  loaf. This bread has a high liquid content, so the top may fall during
  baking. Use a light crust setting. The crust will be somewhat darker than
  usual, due to the fresh cheese in the recipe.

      2 c  Uncooked macaroni
      3 tb Butter or margarine
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
      2 tb Flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Dry mustard
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      2 c  Milk
  2 1/2 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      1    Roll (hard crust sourdough
           - or french roll)
      2 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
 
  Cook macaroni according to package directions.
  
  In large saucepan, melt butter.  Add onion and cook until tender. Stir in
  flour, salt. mustard, salt and pepper. All milk slowly, stirring
  constantly, and cook until sauce is thickened and bubbly. Add cheese and
  stir until melted.  Combine cooked macaroni and cheese mixture and mix
  well. Pour into buttered casserole. (I use one that's about 12" square).
  Top with topping and bake in 375 oven for 20 - 25 minutes.
  
  To make topping:  tear roll apart and use steel blade of food processor to
  chop into fine bread crumbs. Melt better in small saucepan then add crumbs
  and toss until covered with butter. Combine buttered crumbs with cheese and
  spread over casserole.
  
  I generally serve this with sauteed Kielbasa.
  
  Kraft's Macaroni and Cheese is great and I always have boxes in the
  cupboard as it's something my son can make in a hurry. However, "sure
  doesn't compare to Mom's!"
  
  As with many of my recipes, I evolved this from one I originally found on a
  macaroni box.

  is best when allowed to age overnight in refrigerator and reheated.
  
  To construct the plate of 5-way chili, layer spaghetti on a plate (a
  small oval plate is traditional), top it with hot chili, then with a
  sparse layer of beans, then chopped onions.  Pat on plenty of cheese
  while chili is still hot and serve immediately, with oyster crackers on
  the side.  Serves 4.

      2 lg Eggs
      8 oz Can cream style corn
  1 1/4 c  Water ground cornmeal
           -(white)
     10 oz Sharp cheddar cheese ----
           -1/4 cup coarsely grated
           Remainder cut into 1/4 inch
           -cubes
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped hot
           -chilies, fresh or canned
      4 oz Can whole-sweet red
           -pimentos, roasted 1/2 cut
           -into long strips,
           Other 1/2 coarsely chunked
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
 
  In a small saucepan, melt 6 Tbsp. butter over low heat.  Do not brown.
  Preheat oven to 400.  Put remaining 2 Tbsp. butter into an 8 inch diameter
  baking casserole;  heat in oven no more than 4 to 5 minutes to avoid
  browning butter.  Rotate and tilt casserole to coat inside. Set aside. In
  large mixing bowl, beat milk and eggs.  Smoothly blend 1 cup white
  cornmeal, melted butter, corn, diced cheese, chillies, chopped red pimento,
  baking soda, salt.  Mix thoroughly.  It should have the consistency of
  southern cornbread, moderately runny but not down right liquid. If it seems
  to runny work in 1 or 2 tbsp. white cornmeal. Give butter in casserole a
  final swizzle, then pour in batter, smoothing it level. Sprinkle grated
  cheese over top and decorate with pimento strips. Do not cover. Place
  casserole, exactly in center of oven. Bake until a knife lightly pushed in
  center comes out clean and dry- usually 40 to 50 minutes. Serve at once.
  Cut into fairly thin, pie - shaped wedges. (You can let the bread cool to
  room temperature.) It stores well tightly wrapped in the refrigerator, but
  it is best not to serve it cold. One loaf makes about 8 servings.

      3 tb Butter or margarine, melted
           Salt to taste
      1 c  Pace Picante Sauce
      1 c  Shredded cheddar cheese,
           -as desired
 
  These impressive and easy-to-prepare "pleated" potatoes are an ideal
  accompaniment to all manner of meats, fish and poultry. Thanks to Ruth
  Krening of Fort Morgan, Colorado for sharing her recipe.
  
  Cut potatoes crosswise into 1/8" to 1/4" slices, being careful not to cut
  all the way through so the potato remains intact. Place cut side up in a
  shallow baking dish. Slip onion slices in between cuts in potato, rounded
  side up. Brush or spoon butter evenly over potatoes; sprinkle lightly with
  salt. Bake in preheated oven at 425'F. 1 hour 15 minutes or until fork
  tender. Remove from oven; spoon Pace Picante Sauce evenly over each potato.
  Continue baking 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese; return to oven just until
  cheese is melted. Serve with additional Pace Picante Sauce.

 Categories: Pasta, Poultry, Cheese/eggs, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Finely chopped cooked
           - chicken or turkey
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
    1/4 c  Minced parsley (optional)
    1/4 ts Ground thyme
    1/4 ts Garlic salt
    1/2 c  Finely chopped celery
      1 c  Grated cheddar cheese, med.
    1/4 c  Dry white wine - or gravy
           Salt and pepper to taste

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Flour
      3 c  Chicken broth - I use
           - homemade gravy instead
      1 c  Milk
      2 c  Grated Cheddar Cheese
    1/4 ts Tobasco
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  In bowl, combine filling ingredients; salt and pepper to taste
  
  In Saucepan, melt butter, add flour.  Stir in broth and milk; cook until
  thickened, stirring frequently.  Add remaining ingredients.
  
  Fill Stuff-a-roni.
  
  Cover bottom of 2 quart baking dish with 1 cup cheese sauce.  Arrange
  filled stuff-a-roni in single layer in baking dish.  Cover with remaining
  sauce.
  
  Cover dish with foil and bake at 375-degrees F., for one hour; or cover
  dish with waxed paper and microwave 30 minutes turning once.
  
  Note: I usually make this dish after Thanksgiving.  I freeze left over
  turkey and gravy, and then later, when turkey seems like a treat again, I
  make the Stuff-a-roni.  I do not use the wine; in it's place I use turkey
  gravy, and when it calls for broth, I also use a fair portion of turkey
  gravy.

      Title: OAT & ONION TARTS
 Categories: 
      Yield: 24 servings
 
-------------------------------FOR THE PASTRY-------------------------------
      5 oz Oat flakes (rolled oats) *
  2 1/2 oz Wholemeal flour
  2 1/2 oz Plain white flour
  2 1/2 oz Butter
  2 1/2 oz Lard
  2 1/2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
           Paprika & cayenne pepper

------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
      1 lb Onions
    1/4 pt Soured cream
  2 1/2 oz Butter
  2 1/2 oz Cheddar cheese
      1    Whole egg
      1    Egg yolk
 
  *Note: Medium oatmeal may be used instead of oat flakes if preferred.
  
  Mix the oats, flours, cheese and a pinch each of salt, paprika and cayenne.
  Cut then rub in the fat, bind with water and leave out to rest.
  
  Peel, quarter and slice the onions wafer thin.  Turn them in melted butter,
  cover and leave to sweat over very gentle heat for 20 minutes or so until
  meltingly tender, just stirring occasionally.
  
  This pastry is rather difficult to handle so it is best to divide it in
  half and roll out in two batches.  Keep the other half covered meanwhile.
  Use the pastry to line little mincepie tins (or individual 4-inch fluted
  flan tins if you prefer).  Don't worry too much if the pastry tears; patch
  it together by pressing it with your fingertips.  Blind bake on a
  pre-heated baking sheet at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6, allowing 12 minutes
  with greaseproof paper and beans, then 12 minutes without the lining.
  
  When the onions are beautifully soft, remove the lid and cook over
  increased heat for several minutes until they are a rich golden brown.
  Season generously with salt and black pepper, add a dash of cayenne and
  paprika and mix well.  Then tip the contents of the pan into a sieve placed
  over a bowl to drain off the buttery juices and to cool the onions
  slightly.  When the pastry cases are cooked, beat the eggs with the soured
  cream, add onions and check seasoning.  Spoon the mixture into the tarts,
  sprinkle the grated cheese on top and bake at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for
  20-25 minutes until the filling is deliciously puffed up and golden.

      Title: ROMAN PIE
 Categories: Meats, Pasta
      Yield: 8 servings
 
----------------------------FOR THE MEAT LAYERS----------------------------
      1 lb Cooked turkey or chicken *
    1/4 lb Cooked ham
    1/4 lb Cooked tongue
     50 g  Canned anchovy fillets
    3/4 lb Mushrooms
      1 lg Bunch parsley
           Lemon juice
           A few black olives
           Canned consomme **

----------------------------FOR THE PASTA LAYERS----------------------------
      6 oz Macaroni
 12 1/2 fl Milk
    1/2 pt Single cream
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Plain flour
      4 oz Cheddar cheese
      1 oz Parmesan cheese
 
  *Note: Weight given for turkey or chicken is skinned, boned weight. Goose,
  pheasant and other birds can be used instead.
  
  **Well-flavoured, clear stock and a little gelatine powder may be
  substituted for canned consomme.
  
  Make a smooth, rich sauce with the butter, flour, milk and cream.  Let it
  simmer for about 4 minutes.  Then, away from the heat, stir in the grated
  Cheddar and Parmesan, a seasoning of nutmeg and some salt and pepper - but
  go carefully with the salt in view of the cheeses and salted meats used in
  this dish.  Let the sauce cool while you cook the macaroni in plenty of
  salted water until al dente.  Plunge the pasta in cold water to arrest
  cooking, drain well and stir it into the sauce.
  
  Slice the mushrooms thickly and saute them well in a non-stick pan with no
  fat.  Season them with about 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, plenty of pepper
  and a little salt and allow to become cold.  Then cut the turkey meat into
  pieces about the width and half the length of your little finger, and mix
  the poultry and mushrooms together.
  
  Cut the ham, tongue and drained anchovies into strips about the same length
  as the poultry but considerably less wide.  Mix the anchovies, ham and
  tongue with a good quantity of fairly coarsely chopped parsley.
  
  Sprinkle about one third to half of the ham mixture over the base of a
  shallow dish of 4 to 4-1/2 pint capacity.  Cover with half the macaroni
  mixture, then all the turkey mixture, then the rest of the macaroni. Spread
  each layer evenly and press down into the dish with a potato masher before
  adding the next layer.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Arrange the remaining ham mixture on top and scatter the olives to make a
  decorative display of the pink, green and black ingredients.  Press down
  lightly then pour on enough barely melted consomme or cool jellied stock to
  cover.
  
  Cover the dish and refrigerate for a few hours until set.  Better still,
  refrigerate Roman pie overnight to allow flavours to blend and mature, but
  be sure to bring it back to room temperature at least two hours before
  serving.

    3/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Ground Mexican oregano
    1/2 ts Salt
      4    Corn tortillas
      4    To 8 eggs
      2    Avocados, peeled and thinly
           -sliced lengthwise
    1/2 c  Grated Monterey Jack or

      4    Lettuce leaves, coarsely
           -chopped
 
  ...Serve fresh fruit, warm wheat-flour tortillas, sweet butter, honey and
  coffee for a great brunch.
  
  1.  In a medium-size saucepan, heat the oil, add the chopped onion, and fry
  over medium heat until the onion is translucent. Add tomato juice, garlic,
  chiles, herbs, and salt.  Reduce heat to simmer for about 10 minutes. Sauce
  can be made a day or hours ahead of time and left at this point.
  
  2.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Warm the tortillas by wrapping in foil
  and placing on the 4 serving plates (Mexican pottery if possible) in the
  warm oven.  At the same time, warm the extra tortillas you are serving as
  bread.
  
  3.  Poach the eggs, using an egg poacher or a frying pan of hot water with
  2 tablespoons vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt added. First break an egg into a
  cup, then stir the water in the frying pan vigorously in a circular motion.
  As you stir, slide the egg from the cup into the water. Cover the pan when
  all eggs have been added.
  
  4.  To assemble the dish, place a tortilla on a plate.  Top with a circle
  of avocado slices, then arrange a drained poached egg (or 2 eggs) on top,
  spoon sauce over, and sprinkle with cheese. Place in the oven until cheese
  melts.  Add the lettuce garnish after the cheese has melted.
  
  Variation: Instead of the tortillas, rinse large "cupped" iceberg lettuce
  leaves and serve the eggs topped with sauce in the lettuce leaves.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1    Onion; sliced
           Sour cream

-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      3 c  Flour;all purpose
  1 1/2 ts -salt
      1    Egg
    3/4 c  -water, approx.
      4 ts Vegetable oil

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 tb Butter
    1/3 c  Onion; finely chopped
      1 c  Potatoes; cold mashed
    3/4 c  Cheddar cheese; shredded
    1/2 ts -salt
    1/4 ts -pepper
 
  DOUGH: In bowl, combine flour with salt. Beat together egg, water and oil;
  stir into flour mixture to make soft but not sticky dough that holds
  together in a ball. If necessary, add 1 Tbsp more water at a time, being
  careful not to make dough sticky. Turn out dough onto lightly floured
  surface; knead about 10 times or till smooth. Halve dough, cover with
  plastic wrap or damp cloth. Let rest for 20 minutes. FILLING: Meanwhile in
  skillet, heat butter over medium heat, cook onion for 3 to 5 minutes or
  till tender. Transfer to a bowl, add mix in potatoes, cheese, salt and
  pepper. Working with one portion of the dough at a time, and keeping the
  remaining dough covered, roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/16"
  thickness. Using 3 inch round cutter, cut dough into rounds. Place 1 tsp
  filling on each round. Lightly moisten edge of one half of dough with
  water, pinch edges together to seal and crimp attractively. Place on cloth;
  cover with damp cloth to prevent drying out. Repeat with remaining portion
  of dough. In large pot of boiling salted water, cook perogies in batches,
  for 1 1/2 hr to 2 minutes or till they float to top, stirring gently to
  prevent perogies from sticking together or to bottom of pan. With slotted
  spoon remove to colander to drain. In large heavy skillet, melt butter over
  medium heat, cook onion for about 5 minutes till golden. Add perogies and
  toss to coat and warm through. Serve with sour cream. MAKES ABOUT 30
  PEROGIES.
  
  Variations: Cottage Cheese: Combine 1 cup press cottage cheese, 1 beaten
  egg, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and 1 Tbsp chopped green onion. Mushroom:
  In skillet, melt 2 Tbsp butter over medium heat, cook 3 cups chopped
  mushrooms and 1/3 cup finely chopped onion for 7 to 9 minutes or until
  moisture has evaporated. Remove from heat; stir in 1 egg yolk and 1 Tbsp
  chopped fresh dill. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

  Twists Is anyone out there like me? I love the Bake-off cookbooks published
  every year after the contest is over. This year's had some great recipes in
  it and I will post two for those who didnt get the book. This on is from
  Linda Sue Burlingame AND IS WONDERFUL . Heat oven to 350, grease 13x9 pan:
  sprinkle with cornmeal. Unroll dough. Press into bottom and 1/4 inch up
  sides of pan to form crust; firmly press perforations to seal. Bake for
  14-19 minutes or until golden brown. Remove. Increase oven temp. to 400.
  Meanwhile in small bowl mash beans with fork, stir in reserved bean liquid
  and chili powder, mix well. Spread evenly over baked crust. Top with
  mushrooms, tomatoes and jalapeno pepper slices. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake
  at 400 for 5 to 10 minutes or until cheese melts. Cut squares and top each
  with sour cream, green onions and sliced olives. Serves 6 or makes 12
  appetizers.
                  Enjoy

  Kofta, a classic dish of Moghul origin, is one of the most important
  preparations of Indian vegetarian cuisine. Traditionally, koftas are
  simmered in a delicate sauce and turned into a curried main dish. These
  kebabs are wonderful served as cocktail appetizers with a yogurt or fruity
  dipping sauce.
  
  The kofta: Combine potatoes, peas, cheese, chile, coriander, cumin, salt,
  cashews and raisins. Form mixture into 1-inch balls.
  
  Make a batter with the flour and water. Season with pinch of salt, if
  desired.
  
  Heat oil to 375 degrees F in a deep fryer or large heavy saucepan. Dip
  balls into batter to coat completely, and deep-fry until brown (do not
  crowd), about 4 minutes. Set aside.
  
  (If you want the kebabs to remain firm, put them on a heated serving
  platter, and tent with foil. To serve, bring cream sauce to a boil and pour
  over kebabs.)
  
  The sauce: Grind cashews, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and garlic with a little
  water to make a fine paste. Set aside.
  
  Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute
  until wilted; stir in ground paste and cook 2 minutes.
  
  Add turmeric, paprika, coriander, cayenne and salt. Stir in half-and-half
  and water. Reduce heat and simmer about 15 minutes.
  
  (May be prepared 2 days ahead, cooled, covered and refrigerated.)
  
  Stir in cream and kofta kebabs. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat.
  Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately.
  
  Note: Chick-pea flour (also called besan) may be purchased at Indian
  grocery stores.

      Title: CHEESE FONDUE, AMERICAN STYLE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           ****FONDUE****
      4 cn Campbell's Cheddar cheese
           Soup, undiluted
      1 lb Cheddar cheese sharp, grated
      5 x  Cloves fresh garlic
           Or 1tbsp. garlic powder
      2 tb Kirsch or cherry brandy
           ****DIPPERS****
           FRENCH BREAD
           Ham
           Shrimp
           Smokie links
           Cocktail wieners
           ****DIPPERS****
           Hot dogs
           Smoked sausage
           Turkey, chicken breast
           Turkey ham
           Broccoli
           Cauliflower
           Carrots
           Mushrooms
           Brussel sprouts
           Cherry tomatoes
           Celery stalk
           Radishes
 
  Heat cheese soup in fondue pot or heavy skillet on low. Slowly add
  grated cheddar cheese, Kirsch, and garlic (for best results use
  freshly pressed) If mixture looks too thin, add 2 or 3 tb flour to a
  small amt. of cold milk, stir until smooth, and slowly add to pot
  while stirring.
  FRENCH BREAD: get the baguettes if available in your area, if not,
  any type will have to do. Be sure to heat it in oven at 350 degrees
  for about 10 minutes, then cut it into bite sized pieces. It's best
  when crusty.
  MEAT DIPPERS: (heat and cut into bite sized pieces any or all of
  these). Ham, shrimp, smokie links, cocktail wieners, smoked sausage,
  turkey breast, chicken breast, turkey ham, hot dogs.
  VEGETABLE DIPPERS : (slightly cooked ...do not overcook, or else the
  pieces will slip off the fondue fork and get "lost" in the pot.... or
  raw), cut into bite sized pieces Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots,
  mushrooms, Brussel Sprouts, cherry tomatoes, celery stalk, radishes.
  VARIATION: Instead of cheddar cheese soup use Campbell's Nacho cheese
  dip (soup) in cans, and substitute part or all of it for regular
  cheddar cheese soup, or add some finely chopped jalapeo peppers to
  the cheese mixture for extra zest.
  SPECIAL HINTS: Serve to company (it's always a hit!) on a cold fall
  day for lunch, or a freezing winter's night, or warm their hearts
  during a gentle spring rain. Best if served accompanied by champagne
  or wine. Best mood is created if candles are lit and a fire is
  blazing in the fireplace.
  Sit fondue pot with fondue in the middle of the table, pot on low
  heat. Place dippers in individual bowls. Each guest gets a fondue
  fork and first spears a dipper with it, then dips it into the cheese
  sauce, twirl it around slowly and balance into mouth. Very addictive,
  so be careful. (Renate's own recipe developed and perfected over many
  years). Enjoy!

           Refried beans
      1 c  Chunky salsa (any degree of
           Eat you prefer)
      1 c  Fatfree or 1% fat cottage
           Cheese
      1 c  Shredded fatfree (or low fat
           If desired) cheddar cheese
 
  Cook noodles according to package directions.  Rinse and drain.
  
  In a small saucepan, mix beans and salsa and heat over a medium flame until
  runny (helps to spread the mixture).  Place a small amount of the bean
  mixture in the bottom of a square 8 or 9 inch baking dish.  Layer four or
  five lasagna noodles over the dish (cut off extra length of noodle and save
  for the next noodle layer).  Spread 1/2 of the bean/salsa mix on top of
  noodles then top with 1/2 the cottage cheese and some of the cheddar. Top
  with more noodles then the remaining bean/salsa mix and cottage cheese. top
  with more cheddar and remaining noodles.  Top with a little more cheddar.
  Bake in microwave at medium-high for 10 minutes (uncovered) or in oven for
  30 minutes at 350 degrees (or until hot and bubbly).
  
  This was really good and alot easier than it sounds.  Giving a recipe for
  how you layer lasagna is really a pain!

  Recipe by: The Cuisines of Mexico by Diana Kennedy ISBN 0-06-012344-3
  Again, there are so many variations of corn-chile-cream dishes that is is
  hard to know just which recipe to choose. For a change, the chiles could
  be left whole, stuffed with corn and cheese, and cooked in cream. But this
  combination is delicious any way.
  
  This is a very rich dish, and is very good served as a separate course
  with hot tortillas. It is best eaten right after it's cooked, as the
  cheese gets tough when reheated.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Melt the butter and cook the onion and garlic, without browning, until
  they are soft.
  
  Cut the chiles into rajas (strips), add them to the pan, and cook them,
  covered, 8 minutes.
  
  Add the corn, heese, and salt to the chile mixture. Cover tightly with
  foil or a lid and let it bake for 20 minutes for frozen corn. If you use
  fresh corn, cook for 40 minutes, adding the cheese after the first 20
  minutes of cooking time.
  
  Serve the vegetables hot, with the sour cream.

      Title: SWEDISH TACOS
 Categories: Ground beef, Original, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Frozen ground beef
      1    Package corn tortillas
      2    To 4 cloves of garlic,
      2 md Yellow onions or 1 huge one
      2    To 22 hot chilies
      1 lg Block of cheddar cheese
      2    Or 3 tomatoes
           Head of iceburg lettuce
           Olive oil and peanut oil
           Salt
 
  I've decided to share++at long last++the only two recipes I can call
  my own.  Both these were developed before I really knew how to cook,
  in times of poverty (which seems to come and go with alarming
  regularity). They're good and cheap, an unbeatable combination.
  Here's number one... Copious quantities of ice cold beer is the best
  accompaniment for this. This dish is a truly international one and
  bears little resemblance to anything from either Sweden (I'm part
  Swedish++hence the name) or Mexico. The inspiration is Mexican, the
  utensils and some of the techniques used are Chinese, the ingredients
  are all-American (with the exception of the tortillas). It's "peasant
  food" in the best tradition++ cheap, full of flavor, healthy and
  satisfying.  I cooked these so often that I got to where I could
  knock out a complete, filling dinner++even with the frozen
  hamburger++in less than half an hour.  Follow the recipe closely++ at
  least the first time to see what it's s'pposed to taste like. I've
  never had anyone dislike this recipe, with the possible exception of
  a vegetarian or two. Slice and dice first.  Put everything into
  separate serving dishes as you cut 'em. Smash the garlic cloves,
  remove the skins and mince coarsely. Chop the onions into pieces
  about a quarter to half an inch square. Dice or slice the hot
  chilies.  Grate the cheddar on the side of the grater with the big
  round holes.  Cut the tomatoes into chunks about the same size as the
  onions or a little larger.  Shred the lettuce finely++ into strips
  maybe 1/8 inch wide. The essence of this dish is textured savoriness.
  The sharp cheddar, hot chilies, and yellow onions all contribute
  without overpowering one another. The tomatoes, besides adding a nice
  acidy zing, also give moisture. But the key to the savoriness and to
  the unique taste of the dish lies in the first two steps involving
  the garlic, onions and hamburger. Cheap hamburger is used because it
  has a high fat content and lots of taste. I've made this with chopped
  sirloin and the like and believe me, the result is definitely
  inferior to using the cheap stuff. Now that you've got everything
  sliced, diced and chopped you can start cooking. Actually, I usually
  do these first couple of steps prior to doing most of the cutting.
  That speeds things up a bit. Heat a wok over high heat and put in a
  nice dollop of peanut oil++ about 2 tablespoons or so.  Let it heat
  for a minute then toss in the minced garlic, followed a second or two
  later by about 2/3rds of the chopped yellow onion++the rest goes on
  the table, raw.  Right about now, it's gonna start smelling good in
  the ol' kitchen.  Stir the onions and garlic and reduce the heat to
  medium.  Take the frozen hamburger out of its wrapping and put it in
  the wok as is.  Smoosh it down and push the onions and garlic out of
  the way so the surface of the frozen hamburger is in contact with the
  hot surface of the wok.  If you haven't already whacked up everything
  else, now's the time to get on that. As the hamburger browns, scrape
  off the done surface with a slotted spoon or spatula of some sort.
  This goes on during the whole cooking time. Flip the block of meat
  over and scrape off the browned bits.  Let the other side brown a bit
  then repeat the process.  The idea is to brown both the onions and
  the garlic well. Big no-no's, I know, but I was young and ignorant
  and what did I know. As it turns out it was a happy mistake. The
  browned onions and garlic give an nice sharp, distinctive savoriness
  to the finished dish. I salt the meat periodically while it's
  cooking. The reason for using frozen hamburger is that when it's all
  finally cooked, you'll have bits of meat ranging all the way from
  well done and crunchy to nearly raw. This gives a very interesting
  texture and deepens the range of tastes. You may need to lower the
  heat under the wok toward the end to avoid over cooking the meat. And
  the bits will all be steeped in the wonderful juices from the cooking
  onions and garlic.  Sometimes I drain the meat at the end of cooking,
  sometimes I don't.  It depends on how fatty the meat is. These should
  have taste, but not be grease- burgers. You should be through
  chopping the rest of the stuff about the time the meat gets done.
  Now's the time to tackle the tortillas.  I prefer soft tortillas over
  the deep fried, crunchy shells. I use an old, cast iron griddle that
  fits over two burners. I heat the griddle over a medium fire, then
  pour a bit of olive oil onto it. This doesn't add any taste, but the
  aroma while the tortillas are cooking is heavenly!  I warm two
  tortillas at a time, flip them over and let them cook a bit more.  As
  they're done, I put them on a plate covered with pot lid to keep them
  warm. Soon as the tortillas are done, put everything on the table in
  the individual bowls and dig in. Everyone assembles their own tacos
  according to their tastes. My method is to put on a layer of
  meat++not too thick, then a layer of the chopped hot chilies, a layer
  of cheddar, a layer of chopped raw onions, then tomatoes and finally
  a layer of iceberg lettuce.  Just before folding I anoint the whole
  mess liberally with Tabasco sauce.  I've also used Jamaican
  Pickapeppa sauce and it's quite good on these too.  Season with salt
  during assembly if you like. The finished dish is an incredible
  medley of tastes and textures, each distinct and flavorful, with at
  least two distinct kinds of hotness. Great food that you eat with
  your fingers. What could be better?

      Yield: 1 servings
 
     14 oz Strong Plain Flour
     10 oz Medium Yellow Corn Meal
           -Not Corn Flour
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Baking Powder
      8 fl Milk
      4 tb Sunflower or Soya Oil
      2 tb Natural Yoghurt

----------------------------------OPTIONAL----------------------------------
      8 oz Grated Cheddar Cheese
 
  Grease a 2 pound loaf tin and heat the oven to gas mark 5,375F,190C.
  Place the flour, corn meal, sugar and baking powder into a bowl, and
  beat in the eggs, milk, oil and yoghurt. Mix all the liquids together
  first if you like, then pour them in. Give the mixture a good stir.
  At this point you could add 8 ounces of grated Cheddar Cheese or
  similar. Pour into the tin and bake for 55 minutes. Test with a
  skewer - if it comes out clean it's ready, if it's a bit smeary it
  needs another 5 to 10 minutes, but cover the top with foil to stop
  the crust burning. Remove when ready and let it stand for five
  minutes before turning out. You may find a knife round the edge helps

      Title: HERBED BISCUIT EGG BAKE
 Categories: Eggs, Herb/spice
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Herbed biscuit crust:
      2 c  Flour
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1 ts Dried crushed rosemary
      1 tb Garlic powder
      1 ts Lemon pepper
      6    To 7 tablespoons shortening
    2/3    -3/4 cup milk
           FILLING:
      7    Eggs
      1    Onion, chopped
      2 c  Lightly steamed broccoli
           Flowerets
      1 c  Grated cheddar cheese
      1 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 ts Dried tarragon
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
    1/2 ts Lemon pepper
    1/2 ts Salt (optional)
 
  1. To make biscuit crust: Into bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and salt.
  Add the garlic powder, lemon pepper, thyme, and rosemary.  With pastry
  blender or 2 knives, used scissor-fashion, cut in shortening until mixture
  is like coarse corn meal.  Make well in center; pour in 1/2 cup milk.
  With fork, mix lightly and quickly.  Add enough more milk to form dough,
  just moist enough to leave sides of bowl and cling to fork as ball.  Knead
  a few times, working gently, until a dough is formed.
  
  2. Press the biscuit dough into an 8" x 8" inch pan, lining bottom and
  sides.  Depending upon how thick you want the crust, there may be a little
  left over -- it can be used for biscuits baked on the side or as a crust
  for a smaller individual dish.
  
  3. Lightly cook the chopped onions -- either steam, saute, or cook in the
  microwave for a few minutes.  Spread the onion over the dough in the pan.
  
  4. In a bowl, mix the eggs, tarragon, thyme, garlic powder, lemon pepper,
  and salt if desired.  Pour into crust.
  
  5. Add the broccoli flowerets to the egg mixture in the crust.  Sprinkle
  the cup of grated cheddar cheese over the top.  Bake in a 400 degree oven
  for 35-40 minutes.
  
  Note: You can vary the ingredients by using different vegetables, cheeses,
  or meats in the filling.  You can also substitute your favourite herbs in
  the crust.

      Title: FONDUE INDIENNE
 Categories: Fondue, Entrees, Parties, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Garlic clove, crushed
      1 md Onion, grated
  1 1/4 c  Dry white wine
      2 t  Curry powder (more or
           -less, to taste)
      2 T  Flour
  2 1/2 c  Cheddar cheese
           -(matured), grated
    1/4 c  Fruit relish, spicy
    1/2 t  Salt
           Pepper, freshly ground,
           -to taste
 
  Rub the bottom and sides of the fondue pot with the clove of garlic before
  crushing it and using it in the next step.
  
  Bring the garlic, onion, wine and curry powder to simmering point in the
  fondue pot.  If you want to speed things along a little then you can do
  this on the stove and then transfer the mixture to the fondue pot.
  
  Combine the grated cheese and flour by tossing in a plastic bag.  Gradually
  stir in the cheese, a handful at a time.  Allow it to melt completely
  between each addition. When all the cheese has been added the mixture
  should be bubbling and smooth.
  
  Stir in the relish.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Keep the
  mixture warm over a burner, seat your guests down, fill their wine glasses
  and enjoy your meal.
  
  I often add more cheese than the recipe calls for.  You can use any of the
  following as dippers with the fondue:
  
  :  o  Mushroom caps, sauteed quickly in butter, tossed in chopped parsley
  :  o  Whole, peeled and deveined prawns
  :  o  Fresh pineapple chunks
  :  o  Canned artichoke hearts, well drained and halved
  :  o  Unpeeled apple wedges, thick banana slices or peeled pear quarters
  :  o  Thick cucumber slices or chunks
  :  o  Small whole radishes
  :  o  Cauliflower
  :  o  A small French loaf per person
  :  o  Anything else that tickles your fancy
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cheese fondue with curry flavor -- This is a very tasty meal and a lot
  of fun as well. You will need to have a crockery fondue pot and a burner,
  as all the cooking happens on your dinner table with your guests doing all
  their own cooking! My wife and I enjoy a fondue with dinner guests or
  simply by ourselves, and this is one of our favourites. This recipe is
  adopted from one published by the Australian Dairy Corporation many years
  ago.
  
  *  Toss fruit in lemon juice to prevent browning.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
      3 lb Chicken pieces
     16 c  Water
      1 t  Celery seed
      1 t  Black peppercorns
      2    Garlic cloves, peeled
      1 lb Tomatoes (canned),
           -whole, peeled (do not
           -drain; reserve the liquid)
      1    Onion, cut into
           -1/2-inch pieces
      1    Green pepper, cut into
           -1/2-inch pieces
      3    Sprigs fresh cilantro
    1/2 t  Cumin, ground
    1/4 t  Cayenne or chili powder
    1/4 t  Ground white pepper
      1    Garlic clove, minced
     10 oz Corn, frozen
      4    Green onions,
           -coarsely chopped
           Salt
      1 c  Rice, cooked (cook about
           -3 oz of raw rice to get
           -that much cooked rice)
      2 t  Parsley, minced
      4 oz Tortilla chips
    1/2 lb Cheddar cheese, grated
 
  Combine chicken and water in stockpot.  Add celery seed, peppercorns and
  garlic tied in cheesecloth.  Cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer
  for about 45 minutes.  Remove chicken from broth and let cool.
  
  Strain broth and return to pot.  Add tomatoes, onion, green pepper,
  cilantro, cumin, cayenne, white pepper and garlic. Cover and simmer 30
  minutes.
  
  Add corn and green onion.  Simmer 10 minutes.  While this is cooking, skin
  and bone the chicken pieces and cut the meat into bite-size pieces. Add
  salt to taste. Add the chicken, rice and parsley to the broth, and heat
  through.
  
  Garnish each bowl with a few crisp tortilla chips (homemade are best, or
  those made in a homemade style) and some grated cheddar cheese.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spicy soup with cheese, tomatoes and corn -- This is a recipe from
  Salmagundi, a San Francisco soup restaurant chain.
  
  *  I usually make this with leftover chicken.  You don't actually need a
  whole chicken worth, even a small amount will do. In this case, I use a
  mixture of chicken broth and water (about 2/3 chicken broth) for the
  liquid.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  2 hours, most of it simmering.

      Title: TEX-MEX STYLE TACOS
 Categories: Meats, Tex-mex, Usenet
      Yield: 12 tacos
 
      2 lb Ground beef,
           -extra-lean
      1 md Onion, chopped fine
    1/2 t  Salt
      4 T  Chile powder
           -(or more to taste)
           Vegetable oil
     12    Corn tortillas (the
           -thinner the better)
    1/2 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -sharp, grated
      1 lg Tomato, chopped
      3 c  Shredded lettuce
 
  Brown the ground beef and chopped onion in a large skillet.  There should
  be enough fat in the beef to eliminate any need for extra oil and also to
  saute the onions at the same time. While you are browning the beef (it
  should be completely cooked with no pink or red color left), be sure to
  break it up so that it is granular in texture, as opposed to chunky, when
  completely browned. Onions should be limp and translucent but not brown.
  
  Drain off as much fat as possible.  Add salt and  chile powder and continue
  to saute until the chile is completely incorporated into the meat mixture.
  Cover skillet and leave on extremely low heat, just enough to keep the meat
  hot.
  
  Put about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a small skillet, and heat it.  Test
  the oil for proper temperature by putting in a small piece of tortilla.
  When the oil reaches the temperature where it immediately begins to bubble
  frantically over the tortilla as soon as it is put in the oil and the
  tortilla piece becomes crisp quite quickly, you are ready to cook the taco
  shells.  This is important because there is nothing worse than a soggy taco
  shell (which results from the oil not being hot enough).
  
  Using tongs, put the tortillas in the oil, one at a time,  and cook for
  30-60 seconds until the underside just starts to become crisp. With the
  tongs, turn the tortilla over and, using a spatula, bend in half to form
  the shell. Cook each side of the bent tortilla until crisp, about 30-45
  seconds per side. Remove the shell from the oil and drain on a
  newspaper-covered cookie sheet. The cooked shells can be kept warm in the
  oven at very low heat.
  
  To assemble, fill each shell about 2/3s full of the meat and top with
  cheese, tomato and lettuce. We like to add extra zap with a shot of Tabasco
  sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  San Antonio, Texas style tacos -- My dad is from east Texas and my mom
  from southern Oklahoma, but they developed their definition of Tex-Mex from
  several years in San Antonio. Since they now live in D.C., they feel
  extremely deprived, none of the chain restaurants come anywhere near the
  taste they developed in San Antonio.
  
  Tex-Mex cooking is based on peasant-style dishes from the areas of Mexico
  bordering Texas.  The primary ingredients of Tex-Mex cooking are corn
  tortillas (the thinner the better), ground beef, pinto beans and hot chile
  powder, sharp Cheddar cheese and onions.  Yield:  1 dozen tacos.
  
  *  Don't try to use instant onion in this recipe.  In San Antonio, people
  consider that the best chile  powder is Gebhardt's or Eagle Brand.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

      Title: TEX-MEX STYLE ENCHILADAS
 Categories: Meats, Tex-mex, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Ground beef,
           -extra-lean (as
           -little fat as possible)
      2 md Onions, chopped
      4 T  Flour
  2 1/2 c  Enchilada sauce
           -(2 standard cans)
      1 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -sharp, grated
 
  PREPARE SAUCE AND FILLING:  Brown ground beef and 1 chopped onion in a
  large skillet. There should be enough fat in the beef to eliminate any need
  for extra oil and also to saute the onions at the same time. While you are
  browning the beef (it should be completely cooked with no pink or red color
  left), be sure to break it up so that it is granular in texture, as opposed
  to chunky, when completely browned. Onions should be limp and translucent
  but not brown.
  
  Add about 4 T  of flour and saute until flour is completely incorporated
  into the meat mixture. Add the enchilada sauce. Heat over low heat. If the
  mixture is too thick, add a little water.  The consistency should be that
  of a thick gravy, but not soupy. Simmer over low heat for 20-30 minutes.
  
  PREPARE ROLLED ENCHILADAS:  Rolled enchiladas are tougher to assemble, but
  more authentic.  Have ready a large baking pan, we always use an oblong
  Pyrex pan. One at a time, dip each tortilla in the enchilada sauce just
  enough to coat and slightly soften. Lay the tortilla flat in the baking
  pan, spoon about 3 T of the enchilada sauce in a line down the middle, top
  with about 1 t chopped onion and about 3 T of grated cheese.
  
  Roll the tortilla tightly into a cylinder with the seam on the bottom, and
  position against the bottom edge of the baking pan.  Repeat until the pan
  is full. This can get tricky (but it is possible) as the pan gets full.
  Assembling the enchilada outside of the pan is usually a messy disaster.
  Depending on the size of the pan and how tightly each enchilada is rolled,
  you can get 8-12 enchiladas in a pan. This recipe should make about 16-24
  enchiladas.
  
  Spoon enchilada sauce over the assembled enchiladas to thinly cover.
  Sprinkle generously with grated cheese. Bake at 425 degrees F. for 20
  minutes.
  
  PREPARE STACKED ENCHILADAS:  This is the New Mexico style.  It is much
  easier to assemble. Have plates ready. One at a time, submerge each
  tortilla in the enchilada sauce (which should be cooking on low heat during
  this process) and cook until limp but not falling apart, this may take a
  little practice to gauge the time.
  
  Remove the tortilla from the sauce and place flat on a plate.  Spoon a
  little sauce, including meat, over the tortilla, add about 1 T chopped
  onion and about 4 T grated cheese. Repeat the process until you have a
  stack of 3-4 tortillas on a plate, depending on the appetite of the person
  who will eat them. Top the last tortilla with a generous amount of sauce
  and cheese. Serve immediately.
  
  The fundamental difference between these two styles is the method used to
  cook the tortillas. In the rolled style, the sauce is cooked into the
  tortilla through the baking process. In the stacked style, the tortilla is
  cooked directly in the sauce. Only the appearance differs, the taste is the
  same with either style.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Central Texas style Mexican enchiladas -- We cook beef enchiladas in two
  ways, the traditional rolled enchilada and the easier-to-cook New Mexico
  stacked style.  Both procedures are given.  Also, we used to cook the
  enchilada sauce/chili from scratch but more recently began using a shortcut
  with canned Old El Paso brand enchilada sauce, since it is not only faster
  (20 minutes vs. 4+ hours) but also has a very authentic spice combination.
  Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  I always use Old El Paso canned enchilada sauce, though it is possible
  to make your own.

  In a small skillet, heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil.  Test the oil for
  proper temperature by putting in a small piece of tortilla.  When the oil
  reaches the temperature where it immediately begins to bubble frantically
  over the tortilla as soon as it is put in the oil and the tortilla piece
  becomes crisp quite quickly, you are ready to cook the chalupa shells. This
  is important because there is nothing worse than a soggy chalupa shell
  which results from the oil not being hot enough.
  
  Fry tortillas completely flat on both sides until very crisp.  Drain and
  keep warm on a newspaper-covered cookie sheet in a warm oven.
  
  Spread about 1/4-inch thick layer of refried beans on each fried tortilla.
  Top with a generous amount of grated sharp Cheddar cheese and about 1 T
  chopped onion.
  
  Place assembled chalupas on a cookie sheet and brown under broiler until
  cheese melts.  Watch them carefully under the broiler, they can burn quite
  quickly.  Top with shredded lettuce and tomato and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Tex-Mex style tostada -- You will need to first make a batch of frijoles
  refritos.  This dish is more properly known in Mexico as tostadas.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes, plus preparation time of frijoles refritos.

      Title: RUBEN VILLAVICENCIO'S VEGETABLE PIE
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      3 c  Potato (raw),
           -packed, grated
           -(about 3 large potatoes)
      1 t  Salt
      4    Eggs
  1 1/4 c  Onion, grated
           -(or more to taste)
      2 T  Oil
      3 T  Butter
      1    Garlic clove, crushed
           -(or more to taste)
      1    Broccoli bunch, broken
           -into small florets
    1/2 t  Basil, dried
           Thyme
      2 c  Cheddar cheese, grated
      1 c  Milk
           Paprika
 
  Drain the potatoes and squeeze dry.  Add about 1/2 t salt, 1 egg and about
  1/4 cup (or more to taste) grated onion. Pat potato mixture into well-oiled
  10-inch pie pan and bake at 400 degrees F. for 30 minutes.  Brush potato
  crust with oil, reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F. and bake for
  another 5-10 minutes, until crust is brown.
  
  While crust is baking, saute about 1 cup chopped onion and garlic in
  butter. If you like a lot of onion and garlic, use more. Add broccoli,
  about 1/2 t salt, basil, a dash of thyme, and cook covered, stirring
  occasionally, for a few minutes.
  
  Spread half of cheese over baked crust.  Top with sauteed vegetables and
  remaining cheese.
  
  Beat together remaining 3 eggs and milk,  and pour over vegetable/cheese
  mixture.  Sprinkle paprika on top.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 35 to 40
  minutes until custard is set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A wonderful vegetable pie -- This recipe is originally from the _Los
  Angeles Times_.  It takes a lot of time to make, but it's quite good.
  Yield: serves 3-4.
  
  *  This recipe can be made in two stages:  you can make the crust in
  advance and then can make the vegetable topping and bake it later.
  
  *  An electric grater is a real time-saver for the crust ingredients.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 1/2 -2 hours.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: JACK JUBILEE
 Categories: Casseroles, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2 T  Butter
      8 oz Tomato sauce
           -(1 large can)
      4 oz Green chili peppers,
           -chopped (1 can)
    1/2 t  Salt
      2    Eggs, slightly beaten
      1 c  Half-and-half
           -(or light cream)
     11 oz Corn chips (one package)
    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese
           -(cut into 1/2 inch cubes)
    1/2 c  Cheddar cheese (shredded)
           Paprika
      1 c  Sour cream
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Saute onion in butter until transparent.
  Stir in tomato sauce, chopped peppers and salt. Simmer 5 minutes. Remove
  from heat. Combine eggs and cream. Stir into sauce.
  
  Place half the corn chips in bottom of a 1 1/2 quart casserole.  Add in
  layers, half the Monterey Jack cheese, half the sauce.  Repeat.  Top with
  sour cream. Sprinkle with shredded cheddar cheese and paprika. Bake,
  uncovered, for 30 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A casserole made with jack cheese -- I got this recipe from the National
  Dairy Council.  It's good winter food; easy to make and rich.
  
  Don't let the corn chips put you off; normally, such an ingredient would
  make me think it's one of those recipes for people who don't like to cook
  and don't care about good food. Take my word for it: this recipe is an
  exception.
  
  *  Ingredient notes for non-US cooks:  Monterey Jack cheese is a bland
  American cheddar from Monterey, California.  Try substituting Dunlop
  (Scottish), Lancashire (English), or Cantal (French).  Half and half is a
  dairy product that is 50 percent whole milk and 50 percent heavy cream;
  light cream makes a reasonable substitute. Corn chips, often sold as
  "Fritos" or "Doritos," are a packaged snack food made of deep-fried pressed
  cornmeal. I cannot think of any reasonable substitute for them in this
  recipe.  [Ed.]
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.

      Title: NEW MEXICO ENCHILADAS
 Categories: Entrees, Southwest, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Beef, ground
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
           -(or less)
      1 t  Salt (more or less
           -to taste)
           Pepper
      3 t  Chili powder (or less,
           -to taste)
      1 T  Flour
      4 oz Tomato sauce
      8 oz Water
      2    Corn tortillas
      2    Eggs
           Vegetable oil
      1 c  Lettuce, shredded
      1 lg Tomato, chopped
      1 md Onion, chopped
      5 oz Cheddar cheese, grated
 
  Saute the beef over medium heat until it has lost its raw red color,
  chopping it with the edge of a spoon into small pieces as it cooks. Add the
  garlic and spices and cook another 3-4 minutes. Add salt, pepper and chili
  powder to taste. Remember that the flavor of chili mellows as it cooks,
  although it won't get less hot. Add the flour to the meat mixture and stir
  well.  Add the tomato sauce and water. Simmer gently (uncovered) for about
  45 minutes, until it has thickened and the flavors are blended.
  
  Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat, until
  it sizzles when a bit of tortilla is dropped in. Soften the tortillas
  briefly in the oil, one at a time, about 5 seconds on a side. (Turn with
  tongs, being careful not to tear them.) Drain on paper towels. Prepare
  another small skillet with a small amount of oil in the bottom, enough for
  frying an egg.
  
  Assembling the enchiladas requires you to keep track of several things at
  once.  Start an egg frying for each enchilada.  Make sure that the yolk is
  cooked soft, not hard! Put one tortilla on a dinner plate.  Cover it with a
  medium-thick layer of meat sauce.  Sprinkle chopped onion and grated cheese
  on top. Sprinkle lettuce and chopped tomato around the edge. Top with
  another tortilla. Cover with more meat sauce, sprinkle more onion and
  cheese.  Now top with the fried egg and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  New-Mexico-style enchiladas with eggs -- This is the way my grandmother
  and aunt made enchiladas; I haven't lived in New Mexico myself, but that's
  where this recipe came from. Yield: Serves 2.
  
  *  You can also make single-decker enchiladas, for people with small
  appetites.  Omit the second layer of tortilla, meat, onion and cheese, but
  don't forget the egg.  If you make single-deckers, you will need twice as
  many tortillas and twice as many eggs, but the same amount of the other
  ingredients.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes simmering, 5 minutes assembly.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  1 1/2 lb Ground beef
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      4    Garlic cloves,
           -chopped (or less)
      1    Green bell pepper
           -(capsicum), chopped
      1 T  Chili powder
      1 t  Cumin
      3    Cilantro sprigs
           -(up to 6)
      1 c  Olives, chopped
      1 lb Tomatoes
  1 1/4 c  Enchilada sauce
      8    Corn tortillas
    1/2 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -grated
    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese,
           -grated
      1 c  Corn chips, crushed
 
  Brown ground chuck; drain any excess fat.  Add (chopped) onion, garlic and
  bell pepper; cook until soft.
  
  Cut tomatoes into chunks and  add to beef mixture (including liquid).  Add
  enchilada sauce, chili powder, cumin and cilantro.  Add salt and pepper to
  taste.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes.
  
  Grease a 3-quart casserole.  Steam (or fry) tortillas.  Put approx. 1/3 of
  the meat mixture in the casserole dish followed by a layer of tortillas,
  cheese and olives. Repeat twice. Sprinkle crushed corn chips around the
  edges and bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes or until heated through.
  Cut into wedges.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple Mexican-style casserole with beef and cheese -- This a
  conglomeration of several of my favorite Mexican casserole recipes.  I took
  what I liked best from each one and this is what it turned out to be.  My
  family devoured it instantly and  completely, and it has become one of our
  favorites.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  You can adjust the seasonings to suit your own tastes; I listed
  conservative amounts (for me, anyway!).  You can also add salsa (homemade
  is best) to the casserole, if desired. Serve with fried rice (plain or
  flavored) and green salad.

      Title: MEXICAN CHEF'S SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken (boneless),
           -diced
      1 lb Kidney beans
    1/2 t  Salt
      1 t  Chili powder
      1 md Onion, chopped
      3 md Tomatoes, diced
      1 lb Lettuce, chopped
           -(about half of
           -a large head)
    1/4 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -grated
      1 c  Thousand island
           -dressing
    1/4 c  Picante sauce
           -(or more or less,
           -to taste)
      1 lg Avocado, sliced
    3/4 lb Corn tortilla chips
 
  Bone and dice the chicken.  Heat a small amount of vegetable oil in a large
  frying pan until it starts to smoke.  Add the chicken cubes and fry over
  medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until they are browned (2 or 3
  minutes).  To the chicken, add the drained kidney beans, salt and chili
  powder.  Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Chop the tomatoes, onion and lettuce.  Grate the cheese.  Toss them
  together in a salad bowl with the salad dressing and picante sauce. Slice
  the avocado and add to the salad. Break the tortilla chips into flakes and
  add to the salad.
  
  Mix the cooked chicken and beans into the cold salad.  Decorate with extra
  chips and slices of avocado and tomato.  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple main-dish salad with Mexican seasonings -- I got this recipe
  from an old roommate, Ann-Marie Tarter. My husband revised it to use
  chicken instead of the hamburger that her version called for. It's a very
  simple, tasty hot-weather main dish. It doesn't keep as leftovers: you have
  to eat all of it immediately or else throw it away. I like to serve it
  accompanied by Aztec soup. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  The chips get soggy within 5 to 10 minutes after the meat has been added
  to the salad, so don't do that step until you are ready to eat.
  
  *  This recipe works best with iceberg lettuce.  The more exotic varieties
  of lettuce wilt instantly when the hot chicken and beans are mixed in;
  iceberg lettuce keeps its crunch.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation.

 Categories: Casseroles, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Bacon, thick-sliced
           -and lean
      1    Onion
      1 lb Baking potatoes
    1/2 lb Cheddar cheese
      8    Eggs
 
  Cut the bacon slices into square pieces.  Fry the pieces until well-cooked,
  then drain on paper towels.
  
  Peel the potatoes, then grate them.  To prevent the grated potatoes from
  discoloring while you prepare the other ingredients, you can put them into
  a bowl of cold water. When you're ready to use them, be sure to drain well
  and squeeze them dry.
  
  Grate the cheese.  Mince the onion.  Butter a 9x13 inch shallow baking
  dish. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Beat the eggs in a large bowl.  Add all the other ingredients and stir.
  Pour the mixture into the baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for
  about 45 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked. Serve hot, warm or at room
  temperature.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A brunch casserole with potatoes, eggs, bacon and cheese -- This is a
  very easy brunch dish, similar to a fritatta in texture, but full of
  traditional breakfast ingredients. The recipe comes from a cookbook
  published by the _Contra Costa (California) Times_ newspaper, called
  "Tastes of the Times." Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  It really does make a difference if you use good meaty bacon for this. I
  find the best bacon at my local butcher shop.
  
  *  You can prepare part of this ahead.  I think egg dishes are better if
  they haven't been refrigerated. So if you want to work ahead, you can cook
  the bacon, grate the cheese and potatoes and mince the onion the night
  before. Store all these things separately in the refrigerator, covering the
  potatoes with water. Then in the morning just mix it all up and bake it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (tedious).
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.

      Title: Beet Green Souffle
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Harned 1994, Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 souffle
 
      3 tb Parmesan cheese; grated
      2 md Beets; cooked and peeled
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Flour
    3/4 c  Chicken broth; hot
      1 c  Beet greens; sauteed
    1/2 c  Cheddar cheese; grated
      3    Egg yolks
      4    Egg whites
 
  Butter a 1 qt. souffle dish; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Slice the
  cooked beets and line the bottom of the souffle dish with them.
  
  In a small saucepan, melt the butter, stir in the flour, add the hot
  broth and continue to cook until slightly thickened, then transfer to
  a larger bowl.  Coarsely chop beet greens and add to the sauce along
  with Cheddar cheese.
  
  In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks; blend them with beet green
  mixture. Beat egg whites until they form peaks.  Fold into bowl with
  other ingredients; blend well.  Transfer all to buttered souffle
  dish.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
  
  Bake at 350 F. for 30 minutes, or until souffle is puffed and golden.
  
  Ogden writes: "This may be one of the most exceptional souffles you'll
  ever serve.  The beet color spreads upward from the bottom layer,
  creating a rosy hue throughout."
