A Variation On The Theme Of Pashka

deserts

4  8 oz. pkgs cream cheese
1 cup (2 sticks) butter
3 egg yolks
2 cup sifted powdered sugar
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup toasted, slivered almonds
2 pint (or 3) fresh or frozen
1  strawberries

Let cream cheese, butter and egg yolks stand at room temperature at
least 2 hours.  Beat cheese in a mixing bowl with a wooden spoon or
blend at low speed in electric mixer. Add butter and continue
beating. When well blended, add sugar, then egg yolks, one at a time.
Add vanilla and fold in almonds.

Wash and dry the inside of a Pashka mold or a new 2 quart clay or
plastic flowerpot with drain holes in the bottom. Line the pot with a
double thickness of cheesecloth wrung out in cold water. Spoon cheese
mixture into the pot to the brim.  Cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate several hours or overnight on a plate.

To unmold, trim around and discard top of the cheesecloth. Invert a
dessert plate over the opening of the flowerpot and quickly turn the
whole thing upside down.  Place on table and gently lift off pot,
tugging at the cheesecloth lining if necessary.   When the pot is
clear, gently remove the cheesecloth.

Garnish the base and top of the Pashka with whole strawberries and
strawberry halves.  Serve with additional crushed, sweetened
strawberries as a sauce. You may add some brandy or liqueur to the
sauce if you wish.

Abm Beignets

breakfast, deserts

1 cup water
1  egg
2 tablespoon oil
3 tablespoon nonfat dry milk powder
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cup bread flour
2 1/2 teaspoon yeast
1/2 cup powdered sugar

Place all ingredients except sugar in machine. Program for knead and
first rise and press start. The dough will be sticky at first but
will hold its shape. After the final cycle, it will be workable. When
dough is finished, turn the dough out onto a floured surface and let
it rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough to a generous 1/4" thick and
cut it into 2" squares.

Cover the squares with a clean towel and let rise for 30 minutes. Add
the powdered sugar to a medium-size clean paper bag. Lay out paper
towels to drain the doughnuts. Heat 1 to 1 1/2 " of oil to 375øF. Do
not add too many; add once or it may cool the oil too much. Gently
brush the uncooked squares to remove any extra flour. Slide them into
the heated oil. When they pop to the surface, spoon the hot oil over
them constantly until they are puffed. Turn the squares and cook
until they are a light golden color on both sides. It should take 1
to 2 minutes. Cut the first couple of squares in half to be sure
there is not sticky uncooked dough inside.

Remove from hot oil with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
While warm, drop them, 3 or 4 at a time, into the bag with powdered
sugar and shake until they are well coated. Serve immediately.

Abraysham Kabaub ( Silk Kebab)

deserts

      ----SYRUP----
1 1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup water
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads (optional)
      ----OMELET----
8  eggs
1 pinch salt
      ----TO FINISH----
2 cup oil
3/4 cup finely chopped pistachios *
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom

*Note: Instead of pistachio nuts, walnuts may be used if desired.
Dissolve sugar in water in heavy pan over medium heat. Bring to the
boil, add lemon juice and saffron and boil for 10 minutes. Cool and
strain into a 25 cm (10 inch) pie plate.  Keep aside. Break eggs into
a casserole dish about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter. The size and
flat base are important. Add salt and mix eggs with fork until yolks
and whites are thoroughly combined - do not beat as eggs must not be
foamy. Heat oil in an electric frypan to 190 C (375 F) or in a 25 cm
(10 inch) frypan placed on a thermostatically controlled hot plate or
burner. Have ready nearby a long skewer, the plate of syrup, a baking
sheet and the nuts mixed with the cardamom. A bowl of water and a
cloth for drying hands are also necessary. Hold dish with eggs in one
hand next to the pan of oil and slightly above it. Put hand into egg,
palm down, so that egg covers back of hand. Lift out hand, curling
fingers slightly inwards, then open out over hot oil, fingers
pointing down.  Move hand across surface of oil so that egg falls in
streams from fingertips.  Dip hand in egg again and make more strands
across those already in pan.  Repeat 3 to 4 times until about an
eighth of the egg is used.  There should be a closely meshed layer of
egg strands about 20 cm (8 inches) across.  Work quickly so that the
last lot of egg is added not long after the first lot. Rinse hands
quickly and dry. Take skewer and slide under bubbling omelet, lift up
and turn over to lightly brown other side. The first side will be
bubbly, the underside somewhat smoother. When golden brown lift out
with skewer and drain over pan. Place omelet flat in the syrup, spoon
syrup over the top and lift out with skewer onto baking sheet. Roll
up with bubbly side inwards. Finish roll should be about 3 cm (1 1/4
inches) in diameter.  Put to one side and sprinkle with nuts. Repeat
with remaining egg, making 7 to 8 rolls in all. Though depth of egg
diminishes, you will become so adept that somehow you will get it in
the pan in fine strands. When cool, cut kabaubs into 4-5 cm (1 1/2 to
2 inch pieces and serve. These keep well in a sealed container in a
cool place.

Alain Senderen's Salade De Fruit Exotique (Hh

deserts

2 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 vanilla bean, split
3 coriander seeds
1 whole clove
1/4 teaspoon five-spice powder
1 zest of 1 lime
1 zest of 1/2 lemon
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger
1 sprig of fresh mint (opt)
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1  pineapple
1  mango
2 large kiwis
2 passion fruits

And ideal fruit salad or dessert for Winter, because the tropical
fruits are available year-round and ripen naturally. The riper and
more fragrant the fruit, the better the salad. 
In a small saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups water with the sugar, vanilla
bean, coriander seeds, clove, five-spice powder, lime and lemon
zests, ginger, and mint, if using. Simmer over moderate heat for 10
minutes. Set aside to cook.  Then stir in the lime juice. (The syrup
can be made up and refrigerated for up to a week before serving the
salad.) 
Slice off the top and the rind from the pineapple; quarter it
lengthwise. Reserve 3 of the quarters for another use. Slice 1 of the
quarters crosswise 1/8-inch thick. Using a sharp paring knife, peel
the mango and slice lengthwise, parallel to the pit on both sides,
into disks 1/8-inch thick.  Slice each mango disk in half lengthwise.
Peel the kiwis and halve lengthwise.  Cut each half lengthwise into
thin wedges. 
Divide the fruit evenly and arrange in each of 4 shallow soup bowls,
overlapping the slices to form a decorative pattern. Strain the
reserved syrup and divide equally among the 4 servings. Cover with
plastic wrap and refirgerate for at least 1 or up to 4 hours. Just
before serving, halve the passion fruits crosswise. Using a teaspoon,
scoop the pulk out of each half onto the fruit in each bowl. 

Almond Float With Mandarin Oranges

chinese, deserts

1 1/4 cup boiling water
1/2 cup agar-agar, cut in pieces
1 cup evaporated milk
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon almond extract
2 cup hot water
1 cup mandarin oranges

A light, sweet, gelatinous pudding of very delicate texture, totally
unlike a typical gelatin dessert - Jello it is not. Have large cooled
bowl or (preferably) 9" x 9" glass dish ready for gelatin mixture.
Add agar-agar to boiling water and stir until thoroughly dissolved.
(Watch for burning on bottom.) At this stage, agar-agar will impart
noticeable odor, but it does not carry through to finished dish. Add
evaporated milk and sugar; bring back to boil and boil for 1 minute,
stirring constantly. Add almond extract.  Slowly add hot water,
continuing to stir until sugar is completely dissolved.  As soon as
mixture returns to boil, turn off heat. Pour mixture into bowl for
setting. When it has cooled slightly, cover and refrigerate for at
least 2 hours.  Turn jellied mixture out onto flat plate, then cut it
in 1" squares. Place squares in individ- ual serving bowls with
Mandarin orange wedges and their juice. Cover and return to
refrigerator until ready to serve.

Almond Krumkakes

deserts

1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar
3 each unbeaten egg whites
2 tablespoon ground almonds
1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla

Cream together butter and powdered sugar; beat well. Add by degrees
egg whites, almonds, flour and vanilla. This version can also be used
to make Chinese fortune cookies. COOKING INSTRUCTIONS:
You will need a krumkake iron, which fits over a 7-inch burner
surface (gas or electric).  Always use moderate heat.
For each baking period, the iron should be lightly rubbed at the
beginning with unsalted butter, but after this initial greasing,
nothing more is required. The batter needs a preliminary testing, as
it is quite variable, depending on the condition of the flour, so do
NOT add at once all the flour called for in the recipe. Test the
batter for consistency by baking 1 teaspoonful first. The iron is
geared to use 1 tablespoon of batter for each wafer, and it should
spread easily over the whole surface but should not run over when
pressed down. If the batter is too thin, add more flour.  Should any
batter drip over, lift the iron off its frame and cut off the excess
batter with a knife run along the edge of the iron.
Cook each wafer about 2 minutes on each side or until barely
colored. As soon as you remove it from the iron, roll it on a wooden
spoon handle or cone form, and, when cool, fill it.

Almond Lace Rolls

frozen, sweets

3/4 cup unblanched almonds; *
1 tablespoon (rounded) flour
1/2 cup butter
1 tablespoon heavy cream
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon milk

Recipe by: Margo H. Tyler These cookies require precision timing and fast
action but the results are worth the trouble. I make them for holidays and
special occasions, but they are delicious anytime.

Preheat oven to 350=F8. Butter and flour baking sheet.

In a small, heavy pan, place all ingredients. Cook over low heat, stirring
constantly until butter melts. Drop by teaspoonful: onto baking sheet (do
not bake more than six at one time).

Bake at 350 for 7-9 minutes. Cookies should be only slightly brown and
still bubbling at the center. Let cool only for a minute or so until the
edge is firm enough to lift with a thin spatula Then, working quickly, lift
cookies and turn them top side down onto paper towels. Roll over the handle
of a wooden spoon to get a cylinder shape and let cool until crisp.

Use a fresh cookie sheet for each baking to avoid cookies sticking on
sheet. If cookies get too firm to roll over the spoon handle, place back in
the oven for a few moments.

Store cookies in an airtight cookie jar or tin. They will keep for a long
time, and can be made well ahead of the holiday season.

Variations: These cookies also can be left flat-make them smaller if you
do that; however, they don't have the flair of the rolled lacy effect. Or
roll ends of cooled cookies in melted chocolate.

Almond Tea Jelly

chinese, deserts

4 oz (1/2 cup) ground almonds
2 tablespoon (2 1/2 ground rice
1/2 pint (1 1/4 cup) milk
2 tablespoon (2 1/2 sugar
1 teaspoon gelatin

Here are a couple of recipes for almond pudding. There are lots of
variations of this dish some using dairy products, some using gelatin
and some using agar agar and some combining them. It IS good! This
first one is more "from scratch".  The second uses almond extract.

Mix the almonds and rice in a bowl with 2 pints (5 cups) cold water,
cover and leave for 2 hours.  Strain through a fine muslin into a
large bowl. Add milk and mix well.

Stand the bowl in a large saucepan with enough boiling water to come
halfway up the sides of the bowl.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours,
stirring occasionally.

Add the sugar, stir well and leave to cool slightly. Mix the gelatin
with 2 tablespoons (2 1/2 T) hot water until dissolved. Stir into the
milk mixture when almost cold. Mix well and pour into a shallow
serving dish. Leave until set.

Ambrosia

bananas, deserts

1 1/4 cup cream, heavy
2  bananas (or equivalent amount of so; ft fruit)
1  broken meringue

Whip the cream.  Chop fruit coarsely, but don't crush.  Break meringue into
large crumbs.  Mix everything shortly before serving and pile into glasses.

NOTES:

*  Simple dessert for failed Pavlova attempts -- My mother used to make the
banana variety of this when she cooked her meringues a little too long or
too hot. I've no idea of its origins.

*  I can never make up my mind whether I prefer the strawberry or the
banana version. Peach should be pretty good too, though I've never tried
it.

*  This is a neat way of saving a Pavlova attempt when the meringue part
fails:  it produces a delicious desert and no-one need ever know...

: Difficulty:  very simple.
: Time:  10 minutes presuming you have the meringue available.
: Precision:  No need to measure.

honey, vanilla bean and water. Bring the liquid to a boil. Add the
apricots and bring back to a boil.  Remove from heat.  Invert a
saucer on top of the fruit to keep it submerged.
Cover the saucepan and let stand for 24 hours. During the
marinating, the pits will impart an almond flavor to the apricots and
their syrup. Drain the fruit, reserving the syrup and being careful
not to crsuh the apricots. Halve the apricots. Remove and discard the
pits. Place 4-5 apricot halves in the bottom of each gratin dish , so
they cover the bottom of the dish, PLace the remaining apricots in a
food processor with apricot syrup and puree until smooth. For the
topping: Combine 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar, the almond powder,
butter, egg yolks, and the whole egg in a mixinf bowl and beat with a
whisk until smooth. Divide the batter among the 6 gratin dishes and
spread evenly over the apricots. Sprinkle the top with the slivered
almonds and remaining powdered sugar. Place the gratins in the oven
and bake for 15-20 minutes. Bring the puree witht he Kirsch up to a
simmer. Remove gratins from the oven and place one on each plate.
Garnish with puree, powdered sugar and fresh mint.

Apricotina (Apricot Drops)

deserts, fruits

1/2 lb dried apricots
1 icing sugar
1 a few pistachio nuts - (opt'l.)

Wipe apricots with a damp cloth.  Do not soak or wash them, as this
would make them too moist.  Mince or chop them very finely. Add a few
tablespoons confectioners' sugar to taste, and knead thoroughly by
hand, wetting your hands from time to time to make a smooth, soft,
slightly moist paste. Shape into marble-sized balls. Roll them in
confectioners' sugar and let them dry overnight.  You can insert half
a bright green pistachio nut on top to offset the rich orange of the
apricots.

A splendid variation is stuffed apricotina.  Use 1 tb. ground almonds
or finely chopped pistachios mixed with 1 heaping tsp. sugar. Make a
small hole in the center of each apricotina. Put in a little of the
filling, close the hole again, and roll in confectioners' sugar.

Aunt Mildred's Noodle Kugel

deserts

1/4 cup butter
8 oz noodles, uncooked
3  eggs, beaten
4 oz cottage cheese
2 cup milk
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
12 oz pineapple, crushed, with juice
1  cornflake crumbs, to top

Melt butter in a 9x13 pan.  Add noodles.

Combine remaining ingredients, except crumbs, spread evenly over noodles.
Top with crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about an hour.

NOTES:

*  Noodle kugel using uncooked noodles -- This recipe is interesting
because you don't cook the noodles first. Yield: Serves 6.

*  This recipe is very simple, but it does taste a little pastier than
recipes that require the noodles to be cooked first.  It also comes out
very flat -- most of the kugel recipes I've made in the past use twice as
many noodles in the same size pan. I found that some of the things can be
increased, i.e., add more noodles, more pineapple, more cottage cheese.

: Difficulty:  easy.

Aunty Betty's Bombe

deserts

2 cup double cream
1/3 cup sugar
4 tablespoon water
6 oz chocolate, plain
3 egg yolks

Whisk 1/2 of the cream until stiff and spread it around the edges of a
large bowl. Freeze for 1/2 to 1 hour.

Dissolve the sugar in the water, bring to the boil and simmer for 3
minutes until syrupy.  Meanwhile, break chocolate into blender or
warm bowl.

Pour the hot sugar syrup onto the chocolate and blend or whisk until
the chocolate has all melted.  Add the egg yolks and mix the whole lot
thoroughly.

Whisk the remaining cream into soft peaks and fold gently into the
chocolate mixture. Pour into the centre of the frozen cream and
freeze for several hours until solid. Cover when fully frozen.

NOTES:

*  A high-cholesterol chocolate dessert -- This recipe comes from a
friend's aunt. It always seems to taste wonderful no matter how

*  Although the recipe "serves 4-6," two people will happily eat the
whole thing.

*  The outside is frozen solid, so you may find a fork useful for
breaking your portion into pieces without showering fellow diners
with fragments. It could be served in small portions, but don't count
on having any left over.

*  Double cream has more than 45 percent butterfat. It is difficult
to find cream in North America that is richer than whipping cream,
which is typically 32 percent butterfat. If you can find heavy cream
it is likely to be 36 percent. Use the richest cream you can find.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooling.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

1 cup dates (180g) --  pitted and
1  chopped
1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
1 cup boiling water
2 tablespoon butter
1 cup soft brown sugar
2  eggs

Authentic English Trifle

deserts

1  no ingredients

First, make a soft, rich custard: beat 4 egg yolks until light and
pale yellow.  Heat 2 cups light cream with 1/4 cup sugar and 1
tablespoon orange flower water or vanilla. Add beaten egg yolks,
while beating very hard. Then cook without boiling, stirring
continuously until custard coats the spoon.  Remove to a bowl. Cover
and refrigerate until well chilled. Cut a two-layer sponge cake (that
you bake or buy) into finger-length pieces. Spread each one on one
side with raspberry jam and quickly dip in 1/2 cup sherry. Place half
these sponge fingers in the bottom of a deep cut-glass bowl. Cover
with half the custard. Whip 2 cups cream. Sweeten with 1/2 cup icing
sugar and vanilla to taste. Cover custard with half the whipped
cream.  Make a second layer on top of all this. Top with a dozen or
so toasted almonds, standing them upright in the cream, add a few
slivers of angelica - or use small roses instead of almonds and
angelica. Refrigerate at least 12 hours. This beautiful dessert never
fails to create a sensation, yet is easy to prepare.

BABKA YABLOCHNAYA/ APPLE CHARLOTTE WITH APRIC

candy, deserts

1 tablespoon unsalted butter -- softened
1/2 lb unsalted butter --
1  clarified
3 tablespoon unsalted butter --
1  clarified
16 slice homemade white bread --
1 crusts removed
5 lb tart red apples, peeled,
1 cored -- thinly sliced
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup water
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

With a pastry brush, lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 1 1/2
quart, 3 to 3 1/2 inch deep charlotte or other straight-sided mold
with the tablespoon of softened butter.

Pour all but 3 tablespoons of the clarified butter into a large bowl.
With a sharp knife, cut three slices of the bread into 6 triangles by
slicing them in half diagonally. Cut another 7 slices of bread in
half. One at a time, briefly dip the bread triangles into the bowl of
clarified butter and lay them side by side in the bottom of the mold.
With a small, sharp knife, trim the triangles so that their points
meet in the middle and no spaces show between the slices.  Now dip
the bread halves in the butter and stand them upright around the
sides of the mold, overlapping them slightly. The bread will rise
slightly above the top of the mold.

Cut another 3 slices of the bread into 1 inch squares. Heat the
reserved 3 tablespoons of clarified butter in a heavy 10- to 12-inch
skillet set over high heat and drop in the bread squares. Turning
them about constantly with a wooden spoon, cook the squares for 2 to
3 minutes, until they are lightly and evenly coloured on all sides.
Remove the browned bread squares from the pan with a slotted spoon
and set aside.

In a 4 quart casserole combine the apples, sugar and water. Bring to
a boil over high heat , then cover tightly, reduce the heat to low,
and simmer 30 minutes, or until the apples are tender and show no
resistance when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Uncover and
cook over high heat, stirring frequently, for about 15 minutes, or
until most of the liquid has evaporated and the apples become a
thick, coarse puree. Stir in the cinnamon and refrigerate the puree
until well chilled.

When ready to assemble and bake the dessert, stir the browned bread
squares into the apple puree and pour the mixture into the prepared
mold. Do not be concerned if the filling rises above the rim of the
mold; the apple puree will subside as it bakes.

Preheat the oven to 375F.  Cut 2 of the remaining slices of bread in
half, dip them in butter and place them on top of the filling. Cut
the remaining slice into narrow strips, dip them into the butter and
arrange them around the top to cover the exposed areas.

Bake in the center of the oven for 1 hour or until the bread is golden
brown.  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature, then invert a flat
serving platter on top and, grasping the plate and mold firmly
together, turn them over.  Let the mold rest in this fashion for
another 30 minutes before gently lifting it off the cake.

Either pour the apricot sauce over the top and sides of the unmolded
apple charlotte, or serve it separately in a bowl.

Baked Apples With Apricot & Walnut Filling

deserts

1/4 cup apricots; dried, firmly packed, ch
1/4 cup walnuts; chopped
1/4 cup light brown sugar; packed
1 tablespoon unsalted butter; softened
2 granny smith apples
1/4 cup orange juice; fresh

In a small bowl combine well the apricots, the walnuts, the brown
sugar, and the butter. Core the apples, making each opening large
enough to hold half the apricot mixture, peel the top third of each
apple, and fill the cavities with the apricot mixture. Arrange the
apples in a deep 2 1/2-quart microwave-safe baking dish so that they
do not touch one another or the sides of the dish, pour the orange
juice around them, and microwave the apples on high power (lOO%),
covered with micro wave-safe plastic wrap, for 7 minutes. Pierce the
plastic wrap with the tip of a sharp knife and let the apples stand
covered, for 5 minutes, or until they are tender.

Baked Doughnuts

breads, deserts

2 pkg dry yeast
1/3 cup warm water
1 1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable shortening
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon nutmeg
2  eggs, lightly beaten
4 1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup melted butter
1 cup sugar mixed w/1 tsp cinamon

1. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl and let it
dissolve for 5 minutes. Put the milk and shortening in a saucepan and
heat until the shortening is melted. Cool to lukewarm.

2. Pour the yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the milk
mix. Stif in the 1/4 cup sugar, salt, nutmeg, eggs and 2 cups flour.
Beat briskly until well blended. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups flour
and beat until smooth. Cover the bowl and let double in bulk, about 1
hour.

3. Dust a board generously with flour and turn the dough mass onto
it. This dough is soft and needs enough flour on the board to prevent
sticking, but is easy to handle. Pat the dough into a round about 1/2
inch thick. Use a 3 inch doughnut cutter and cut out the doughnuts,
placing them (and the doughnut holes) on greased baking sheets, 1
inch apart. These don't spread much; they rise. Preheat oven to 450F.
Let the doughnuts rest and rise for 20 minutes uncovered. Bake about
10 minutes or a little longer, until they have a touch of golden
brown. Remove from the oven. Have ready the melted butter and a
brush. On a sheet of wax paper, spread the cinnamon sugar. Brush each
doughnut and doughnut hole with butter and roll in the cinnamon
sugar. Serve hot.

Baklava ( Papadakis Taverna)

deserts

5 teaspoon cinnamon
3 cup coarsley chopped walnuts
1 lb sweet butter; melted
1 lb phyllo pastry sheets
40 whole cloves
1  2 strip of orange peel
1  2 strip of lemon peel
1 cinnamon stick
1/3 cup honey
1/2  lemon; juiced

In a medium bowl place the cinnamon and walnuts, and mix them

butter. Place one pastry sheet in the dish and brush it with the
butter. Repeat this process so that 6 pastry sheets line the bottom

pastry sheets. Cut the baklava into 40 diamond shaped pieces.  Insert
a whole clove in the top of each piece. Preheat the oven to 350 F.

medium saucepan place the sugar, water, orange peel, lemon peel, and
cinnamon stick.  Bring the ingredients to a boil and then simmer them
for 5 minutes. Add the honey and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove
the pan from the heat and add the lemon juice.  Stir the ingredients
together and then let the syrup cool. Remove the orange and lemon
peels, and the cinnamon stick. Spread the cool syrup over the hot

Baklava (La Karen Mintzias)

deserts, greek

3 1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 1/2 cup water
2 tablespoon honey
1 each lemon rind
1 each stick cinnamon
4 each whole cloves
1 1/4 lb walnuts & blanched almonds*
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/2 lb commercial filo sheets
1 lb sweet butter, melted

*Note- Walnuts and almonds should be chopped medium fine. Combine 3
cups sugar, the water, honey, whole lemon rind, and whole spices in a
saucepan and bring to boil.  Lower the heat and simmer for 15
minutes, then remove the lemon peel and spices and cool. Meanwhile,
in a large bowl, combine the nuts, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and
ground spices and set aside. Lay filo sheets flat, cover with waxed
paper and then a damp towel. Keep covered except when removing to
assemble the baklava. Count 8 filo sheets, fold, cover and
refrigerate to reserve for the top. Using a large pastry brush,
butter an 11 1/2-inch by 15 1/2-inch by 3-inch baking pan. Lay a filo
sheet on the bottom of the pan, brush with warm butter, and repeat
using 8 sheets.  Scoop up a handful of the nut-spice mixture and
sprinkle over the top filo sheet inside the pan. Lay on 3 or more
filo sheets, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle again with the
nut mixture. Continue until all the nuts and filo are used. (The
important things here are to butter each filo and spread the nuts
evenly. The way to do the latter is to rotate the pan several times
during the procedure.) Now you can remove the reserved sheets from
the refrigerator and spread over the top, brushing on each sheet.
Using a long, very sharp knife, score the baklava from top to bottom
into diamond shapes planning in advance the size desired.  Be sure
the knife touches the bottom of the pan as you cut.  Heat the
remaining butter to sizzling and pour over the top.  Bake in a 300
degree oven for 1 1/4 hours or until golden chestnut in color and
flaky.  Remove from the oven (in the pan) to a rack, and spoon the
cooled syrup over the entire pastry. Cool in the pan, then serve each
piece individually. Source: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras

1/2 cup low-calorie margarine, melted
1 rose water syrup
1 whole cloves,optional

This rich-tasting baklava contains half the amount of sugar and a
fraction of the fat you would normally use, thanks to reduced fats,
sugar, and nuts. The results will fool anyone. 1. Combine pistacho
nuts, sugar, cinnamon and rose water in small bowl. Using half of
filo sheets (cover remaining with plastic wrap to prevent from drying
out), place 3 sheets in bottom of lightly greased 13x9" baking sheet.
Brush with some of margarine. Sprinkle evenly with nut mixture. Place
remaining sheets over nut filling, brushing after every third sheet
and top sheet. 2. Cut baklava at 1-1/2" intervals diagonally to form
pattern of about 35 diamond shapes. Bake at 400'F. 25 minutes or
until golden. Place on wire rack to cool. Drizzle Rose Water Syrup
evenly over top and allow to soak several hours. Stud each
diamond-shape with whole clove.

BAKLAVA (TDN-6/4/91)

deserts

1 cup sugar
1 cup water
1 1/2 cup honey
2 cup walnuts, finely chopped
3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon allspice
1 1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 lb phyllo dough

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

In saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water; bring to a boil,
stirring until sugar dissolves. Continue to cook over medium heat for
about 20 minutes (until thickness of honey). Stir in honey, continue
to cook about 10 minutes longer.  Remove from heat and set aside to
cool.

In bowl, combine walnuts, 3/4 cup sugar, and spices, set aside. Melt
butter, set aside.

Remove phyllo dough from package, cover unused portion with damp towel
while working with it.  Using kitchen scissors, cut to fit a 9x13
inch pan. Coat pan with melted butter. Place 10 phyllo sheets in pan,
two sheets at a time, brushing each top sheet with melted butter.
Place trimmings between full sheets.  Spread with 1/3 of nut mixture,
4-5 sheets of buttered phyllo then the remaining nut mixture. Top
with remaining phyllo, buttering every other sheet.

With a small, very sharp knife cut pastry lengthwise into 6 strips.
Then cut diagonally to make small diamonds. Heat remaining butter
(there should be 1/2 cup) until frothy and pour it over pastry,
letting it run down into cuts.

Bake in slow oven for 1 hour.  Remove from oven.  Turn oven to 400
degrees. Pour about half of syrup mixture over pastry. Return to oven
for 2-3 minutes until browned on top. Pour remaining syrup over
pastry. Let stand at least 3 hours before serving.

Baklava Rolls

deserts, greek

1/2 lb walnuts, finely chopped
2 1/2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1  syrup:
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup water
1 cinnamon stick
2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup honey
1 lb phyllo dough
3/4 lb unsalted butter, melted

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix first four ingredients together for
filling. Combine syrup ingredients and cook until sugar dissolves and
mixture turns syrupy. Set aside to cool. Remove cinnamon stick before
using.

To Assemble:

Unfold phyllo. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut phyllo sheets
crosswise, into thirds. Cover phyllo not being used with a barely
damp towel. Using two pieces of phyllo - phyllo sheets are so thin
they must be doubled - and keeping narrow ends towards you, brush
with butter. Place 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons filling 1/4 inch from end
nearest you, to within 1/4 inch of sides. Fold long sides in 1/4
inch. Fold over bottom to cover filling.

Place a clean pencil on top of fold and roll into a cigar-like
cylinder.

Push both ends toward center and remove pencil. Place roll on cookie
sheet and generously brush with butter. Repeat with remaining filling
and phyllo.

Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Dip hot rolls into cooled
syrup - kitchen tongs work well for this. Place onto a platter to
cool. Cover and refrigerate. Can be frozen.

Baklava With Cooky Filling

deserts, greek

1 karen mintzias
      ----COOKY FILLING----
2 cup sweet butter
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract
4 cup flour
      ----SYRUP----
4 cup granulated sugar
4 cup water
1 cup honey
1 lemon juice to taste
      ----BAKLAVA----
1 lb toasted blanched almonds *
1/2 cup zwieback crumbs
4 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 dash cinnamon
1 lb phyllo pastry sheets
1 1/2 cup sweet butter; melted

*Note: Either toasted blanched almonds, or walnut meats, or half of
each, (finely chopped) may be used.

Cooky Filling:  Cream the 2 cups sweet butter until light. Gradually
beat in the confectioners' sugar and continue to beat until mixture
is fluffy. Add egg yolk and vanilla or almond extract and blend well.
Work in about 4 cups flour to make a medium-soft dough.  Set aside
and make syrup.

Syrup:  In a saucepan combine the granulated sugar and water. Bring
to a boil and boil for 15 minutes or until syrup is slightly thick.
Add honey and again bring to the boiling point. Add lemon juice to
taste, and cool.

Mix almonds or walnuts, or a combination of the two, with zwieback, 4
T granulated sugar, and cinnamon. Brush 2 sheets of phyllo pastry
evenly with butter and sprinkle with nut mixture. Place 2 buttered
sheets of phyllo on top and sprinkle with nut mixture.  Shape a
portion of cooky filling into a 1/2-inch-thick roll and place the
roll along one edge of the pastry sheets. Roll up loosely, cut into
2-inch slices, and place slices in a buttered cake pan.  (Continue in
this method until all phyllo pastry and/or cooky filling is used.)
Brush tops of each slice with butter and bake in a 350 F oven for 20
minutes or until lightly browned. Dip the hot baklava slices, one at
a time, in cold syrup, allowing each piece to remain in the syrup for
a few minutes.

Baklawa 'be'aj'

deserts

1 lb phyllo dough sheets
3/4 cup unsalted butter; melted
1/2 cup chopped pistachio nuts, opt.
      ----NUT FILLING----
2 egg whites
1/2 cup caster sugar
2 cup coarsely ground walnuts
2 cup coarsely ground almonds
1 teaspoon rose water
      ----ALTAR SYRUP----
2 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon orange flower water
1 teaspoon rose water

Stack 10 sheets phyllo on a flat surface, keeping remainder
covered with a dry, then a damp tea towel.
Brush top sheet of stack with butter, lift sheet and replace on
stack buttered side down.  Brush top with butter, lift top two sheets
and turn over on stack. Repeat until all 10 sheets are buttered,
lifting an extra sheet each time.  Top and bottom of finished stack
should remain unbuttered.
With kitchen scissors cut buttered stack of phyllo into
approximately 10 cm (4 inches) squares.  Stack and cover. Prepare
remainder of phyllo. Depending on size of phyllo sheets, you may have
fewer than 10 left at the end.  Halve sheets if necessary to give 10
layers.
Beat egg whites until stiff and beat sugar in gradually. Fold in
nuts and rose water.
Butter top of phyllo square and place a tablespoonful of nut
mixture in the centre.  Gently squeeze into a lily shape, with four
corners of square as petals and filling in centre.
Place in a buttered 25 x 33 cm (10 x 13 inch) baking dish. Repeat
with remaining ingredients, placing finished pastries close together
in dish.
Bake in moderate oven for 30 minutes, reduce to slow and cook for
further 15 minutes.
Meanwhile dissolve sugar in water over heat, add lemon juice and
orange water and bring to the boil. Boil for 15 minutes, stir in rose
water and cool.
Spoon cool thick syrup over hot pastries.  Leave until cool and
sprinkle pistachio nuts in centres of pastries if desired.
Note: If you are not used to working with phyllo pastry, then it
is advisable to fill and shape the first lot of buttered squares
before going onto the nest lot. The butter firms fairly quickly and
it could be difficult to shape the pastries if the buttered sheets
are left for a time.

Balmy Banana Bake

bananas, deserts

2 tablespoon unsalted butter
8 slightly underripe bananas
3 juice of limes
3 tablespoon light brown sugar

This recipe calls for slightly underripe bananas because, as they
cook, they'll soften up quite a bit. Lime juice keeps the bananas from
discoloring, so they are easily made ahead through step 3. The sweet
and tangy combination is just right served after your jazzy meal.

1. Preheat oven to 375'F.

2. Butter a shallow baking dish; reserve remaining butter.

3. Peel and layer bananas in the buttered dish and drizzle with lime
juice.

4. Sprinkle with sugar and dot bananas with remaining butter. Bake
for 30 minutes, basting once or twice with sauce. Remove bananas from
dish carefully with a long spatula. Serve hot, with sauce spooned on
top.

Ban Dua Ca Ra Men (Coconut Flan With Caramel)

deserts

      ----CARAMEL----
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup hot water
      ----CUSTARD----
1 cup fresh or canned coconut milk
1 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
4  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

This is the ultimate coconut dessert++an adaptation of the classic
"Creme renversee", or "Flan au caramel". The technique used is
distinctly French but the flavors are all Vietnamese.

This custard is at its best when prepared a day in advance and
refrigerated so the flavors can mellow. If you just can't wait, you
might try the Vietnamese method of rapid cooling for dishes such as
this: place a small scoop of shaved ice on top of each custard before
serving!

Preheat the oven to 325F.

Make the caramel:  Cook the sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low
heat, swirling the pan constantly, until brown. Stir the hot water
into the caramel, being careful to guard against splattering (the
mixture will bubble vigorously).  Boil the mixture, swirling the pan
occasionally, until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, about 2
minutes.

Pour the caramel syrup into a 1-quart souffle dish or five 4-ounce
ramekins.  Tilt the molds to coat all of the surfaces with caramel.

Make the custard:  Combine the coconut milk, milk and sugar in a
medium saucepan over low heat.  Scald until the sugar dissolves
completely. Remove from heat.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla. Gradually whisk the hot
coconut milk mixture into the eggs, blending thoroughly.

Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a bowl. Carefully pour
into the caramel-lined souffle dish or ramekins.

Line a large roasting pan with 2 layers of paper towels (see Note).
Put the souffle dish in the roasting pan and add hot water to reach
halfway up the side of the dish.  Bake in the center of the oven for
50 minutes (30 minutes if using ramekins), or until a knife inserted
in the center comes out clean.  Be careful not to let the water boil;
do not disturb the custard while baking.  This is the only "secret"
to producing a smooth and velvety custard.

Remove the souffle dish immediately from the hot water. Allow to cool
in a cold-water bath.  Chill thoroughly.

To serve, run a knife around the edge of the custard and turn out onto
dessert plates.  Serve with shaved ice or whipped cream, if desired.

Note:  The paper towels in the roasting pan serve a twofold purpose:
First, they allow the hot water to circulate under the souffle dish
while baking to distribute the heat evenly; second, if using small
ramekins, it stabilizes them and keeps them from moving around while
baking.

Banana Caramel Custard

bananas, custards, deserts

1 1/4 cup sugar
2 medium slightly overripe bananas,
1 peeled and cut into pieces
8 large eggs
2 can evaporated milk,(12 oz each)
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  strawberries(garnish); optional

Recipe by: Woman's Day Cookbook 1. Fill a roasting pan or a 13x9-inch
baking dish half full of hot tap water and place on an oven rack in
the center of the oven.  Heat the oven to 350F.

2.  In a small heavy saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the sugar over medium
heat for about 5 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally until the
sugar has melted and turns golden brown. (Watch the sugar carefully
after it liquefies.  If it gets too dark it will taste burned.)
Immediately pour the mixture into a 9x5-inch loaf pan so the sugar
covers the bottom of the pan completely.

3.  In a large bowl, beat the banana and the remaining 3/4 cup sugar
with an electric mixer on high speed until completely liquefied with
no lumps. Beat in the eggs.

4.  Add the evaporated milk, vanilla, nutmeg, and salt. Beat with a
mixer on low speed or stir just until blended. Pour the mixture into
the loaf pan. (Don't worry if the caramel cracks.)

5.  Carefully place the baking pan in the center of the pan of hot
water. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes to 20 minutes, or until a knife
inserted near the center comes out clean and the top is browned.
Remove the pan from the water and set on a wire wrack to cool
completely. When cooled, cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.

6.  To serve,  run a thin knife around the inside edges of the
custard. Invert a serving plate over the pan. Invert the pan and
plate together. Lift the pan and allow the syrup to runonto the
plate. Serve right away or cover loosely with plastic wrap and
refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut into 10 slices.

BANANA/PINEAPPLE TROPICAL SORBET

bananas, deserts, low fat

1  pineapple
2 chopped bananas
3 tablespoon sugar
1 cup plain nonfat yogurt
1 tablespoon honey

Because this sorbet is frozen in the pineapple shell, you must cut
out the flesh according to the following special method. First, slice
off the top, just at the point where the edges begin to straighten.
Now stand the pineapple up on its bottom end. Insert a long,
thin-bladed knife into the exposed flesh, next to the pineapple's
outer skin. Push the knife in tin the entire length of the pineapple,
stopping just above the bottom - CAREFUL - you don't want to
penetrate through the bottom. Cut in a circle around the edge just
inside the skin. You've now created a long cylinder of pineapple
flesh that's connected to the shell only at the bottom.

To separate the bottom of this fruit cylinder, insert the knife into
the side of the pineapple, about 1 inch from the bottom. Without
enlarging the hole that is the knife's entry point into the fruit,
fan the blade back and forth, cutting through the inside fruit
cylinder in a large "V". Repeat this procedure on the opposite side.
Now the long, central p pineapple cylinder is free.

Invert the pineapple over a bowl to catch the juice. Plunge a fork
into the pineapple cylinder's top end and, with firm determination,
pull it out into the bowl. Remove the tough central core of the fruit
by cutting the cylinder into quarters and then trimming off the
center strip of eac each piece. Remove any "eyes".

Roughly chop the remaining pineapple flesh and put it into the bowl
with the reserved juice. The rest is easier!!

Puree pineapple flesh and juice with bananas in food processor,
gradually adding the sugar, yogurt and honey. Transfer to ice cream
maker and process according to directions. Scoop sorbet into hollowed
out pineapple shell, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least
an hour.

To serve: Remove from freezer just before serving. Slice the
pineapple from top to bottom into 6 wedges.

Of course, one needn't go to all that trouble...but it's a lovely way
to present the sorbet. If you don't want to do it, then skip all the
hard part, and just chop up the pineapple flesh and go from there and
serve directly out of the ice cream maker!! :)

This will also get posted in the low fat topic, as it only has 1 gm
of fat per serving.....

Bananas Flambees

bananas, deserts

3  bananas
3 tablespoon butter
1 cup sugar
2 oz rum

Peel bananas, splitting lengthwise and cutting in halves. Place
bananas in a buttered, shallow, oven-proof baking dish and dot with
butter. Sprinkle sugar over bananas. Bake uncovered at 325'F for
about 35 minutes. Set dish on stove, being careful to keep warm. Pour
rum in a long-handled spoon, which has been warmed by dipping in
boiling water. Set a match to the rum and as it flames pour over
bananas. As it runs down in the dish, ladle it up and over the
bananas until the flaming ceases. The secret of this dessert is to
have all ingredients warm, otherwise it will not flame well.

This old recipe, as good today as years ago, was brought to Louisiana
by a distant relative of Empress Josephine, at whose table this was
often served.

Bananas Foster-New Orleans

bananas, cajun, deserts, fruits

4 tablespoon butter (1/2 stick)
1 cup dark brown sugar
2  bananas
2 oz banana liqueur
4 oz dark rum
1 ground cinnamon
1 vanilla ice cream (opt)

A quintessential New Orleans dessert, and a favorite among most
locals. This dish cannot be prepared in the kitchen. It must be
performed, in front of your guests. Use a chafing dish, and some kind
of portable heat like Sterno. Don't be sloppy, and keep a fire
extinguisher handy. There's no need to burn the house down just for
dessert, but this really must be done right. I learned to cook this
dish from Chef Joe Cahn at the New Orleans School of Cooking, and he
spun dire tales of what befell those who dared sequester themselves
in the kitchen when making Bananas Foster. Seriously, bad gris-gris
will befall you if you deprive your guests of the spectacle. Plus,
they'll talk for years about how cool you are to have made this for
their dessert.

First, you should make some preparations. Peel a thin strip of peel
from the bananas, and use your knife to slice the banana crossways
into coins. Then replace the banana peel so that it looks untouched
(as best as you can, anyway). This way, you can pretend to "peel"
your bananas, and dump them into the put already cut, as if by magic.
Cheesy, you ask? Well, it still looks cool, particularly if you're
really nonchalant when you do this in front of your guests. If you
insist, you can slice the bananas the classical way, quartering them
by slicing thm lengthwise and then in half. I still think the other
way is cooler.

Put your ground cinnamon into some kind of non-standard container, or
even a little muslin bag, the better to "convince" your guests that
it is, in fact, not cinnamon but voodoo dust, scraped from the tomb
of Marie Laveau at midnight on All Soul's Day ... some kind of
delightfully corny crap like that. Also, I recommend taking a
cinnamon stick and grinding it fresh in a spice or coffee grinder
instead of using pre-ground cinnamon. Sieve the result through a tea
ball strainer to remove the larger pieces which won't grind finely.
This will maximize the fresh, aromatic cinnamon flavor. If you use
your coffee grinder, it'll also make your coffee taste great.

Now, to business ...

Melt the butter and add the brown sugar to form a creamy paste. Let
this mixture caramelize over the heat for about 5 minutes. Stir in
the banana liqueur and rum. Heat until the liquor is warmed, about
three minutes. Add the bananas, cook for about 1 - 2 minutes, then
ignite with a flourish. Here's the best way to do this:

Using a long, bent-handled ladle, scoop up some of the warm liquor.
Hold it a foot or two above the chafing dish and ignite the liquor in
the ladle. VERY CAREFULLY, pour the liquor into the dish. A column of
flame will descend from the ladle into the dish, which will ignite
with a marvelous *poof*! Keep a pal nearby, subtly wielding a fire
extinguisher. Try not to become a human torch in the process.

Agitate to keep the flame burning, and add a few pinches of "voodoo
dust" to the flame. The cinnamon will sparkle orange in the blue
flame, and looks really neat.

Let the flames go out. Serve over ice cream if you wish, but some
hardcores like me like it just like it is. Yum.

Variations: one may substitute any fruit for this dish that has a
correspondingly flavored liqueur -- peaches, pears, whatever. Walt MM

Banh Dua Ca Ra Men (Coconut Flan With Caramel

deserts, vietnamese

      ----CARAMEL----
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup hot water
      ----CUSTARD----
1 cup fresh or canned coconut milk
1 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
4  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

This is the ultimate coconut dessert++an adaptation of the classic
"Creme renversee", or "Flan au caramel". The technique used is
distinctly French but the flavors are all Vietnamese.

This custard is at its best when prepared a day in advance and
refrigerated so the flavors can mellow. If you just can't wait, you
might try the Vietnamese method of rapid cooling for dishes such as
this: place a small scoop of shaved ice on top of each custard before
serving!

Preheat the oven to 325F.

Make the caramel:  Cook the sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low
heat, swirling the pan constantly, until brown. Stir the hot water
into the caramel, being careful to guard against splattering (the
mixture will bubble vigorously).  Boil the mixture, swirling the pan
occasionally, until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, about 2
minutes.

Pour the caramel syrup into a 1-quart souffle dish or five 4-ounce
ramekins.  Tilt the molds to coat all of the surfaces with caramel.

Make the custard:  Combine the coconut milk, milk and sugar in a
medium saucepan over low heat.  Scald until the sugar dissolves
completely. Remove from heat.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla. Gradually whisk the hot
coconut milk mixture into the eggs, blending thoroughly.

Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a bowl. Carefully pour
into the caramel-lined souffle dish or ramekins.

Line a large roasting pan with 2 layers of paper towels (see Note).
Put the souffle dish in the roasting pan and add hot water to reach
halfway up the side of the dish.  Bake in the center of the oven for
50 minutes (30 minutes if using ramekins), or until a knife inserted
in the center comes out clean.  Be careful not to let the water boil;
do not disturb the custard while baking.  This is the only "secret"
to producing a smooth and velvety custard.

Remove the souffle dish immediately from the hot water. Allow to cool
in a cold-water bath.  Chill thoroughly.

To serve, run a knife around the edge of the custard and turn out onto
dessert plates.  Serve with shaved ice or whipped cream, if desired.

Note:  The paper towels in the roasting pan serve a twofold purpose:
First, they allow the hot water to circulate under the souffle dish
while baking to distribute the heat evenly; second, if using small
ramekins, it stabilizes them and keeps them from moving around while
baking.

word for salt and is used to mean "bread". Barm brack is leavened
bread, the word BARM meaning yeast.

2.  The term "barmbrack" for an Irish fruit loaf or cake does not
derive from barm or leaven.  It is a corruption of the Irish word
"aran breac" (Speckled Bread).

Basic Creme Brulee

deserts

2 cup whipping cream
5 egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup light brown sugar -- firmly
1  packed

Combine the first 4 ingredients, stirring with a wire whisk until
sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth. Carefully pour the egg mixture
evenly into 5 (5x1) round baking dishes or custard cups. Place in a
roasting pan large enough to accomodate the dishes and add 1/2-inch
of water to the roasting pan. This step creates a water bath to
prevent curdling. Bake at 275 for 45 to 50 minutes or until almost
set. Cool the custards in the water in the pan set on a wire rack.
Remove from pan when cooled, cover and refrigerate overnight. When
ready to serve, sprinkle about 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar evenly
over each custard; place each custard on a cookie sheet or jelly-roll
pan. Broil 5 inches from heat. If using an electric oven, leave door
partially open. Broil until the sugar melts. Let stand 5 minutes to
allow sugar to harden.

NOTES:

Handle with care. These are extremely hot. Place custards as close to
heat source as possible. To achieve a "cracked" effect, broil
custards in a pan full of ice. Dixie Crystals sugar is reputedly the
best for making this dessert. ***When finished cooking, the center
will still be slightly liquid.

Basic Creme Brulee-Washington Post

deserts, puddings

2 cup whipping cream
1/2 cup sugar
1 vanilla beans, split
1  or
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 egg yolks

Preheat oven to 325 F. Combine cream, half the sugar and vanilla in a
heavy saucepan and scald (bring just to a boil). Remove from heat. If
using a vanilla bean, cover and let infuse for 10 minutes, then
remove bean. Meanwhile, wisk the egg yolks with the rest of the sugar
until slightly thickened. Slowly wisk a small amount of the cream
mixture iinto the egg yolks. (This will warm the egg yolks and
prevent them from curdling.) When the yolks have warmed up , wisk the
yolk mixture back into the rest of the cream. Strain this cream
mixture into four 6 oz ovenproof ramekins. Put the ramekins into an
ovenproof pan and put it in the oven. Fill the pan 1/3 to 1/2 full of
water. Bake until barely set, about 40 to 45 minutes. (When gently
shaken, the custard should jiggle but not be too loose.) Remove
ramekins from water bath, wipe bottoms and chill in refrigerator
several hours to overnight. To serve: Spread an even layer of sugar
on each crreme brulee and melt the sugar carrefully with a small
propane torch. Allow sugar to harden for a few minutes, then serve.
To use a broiler instead of a torch, place ramekins in a large pan
surrounded by ice (this keeps the custard ffrom overcooking.) Broil
as close as possible to the heat source until the sugar melts and
caramelizes, about 2 to 3 minutes. Once the sugar has hardened serve
immediately.

Beard's Beer Batter

deserts

2  eggs, separated
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 tablespoon salt
3/4 cup beer, room temperature
3/4 cup flour

The ultimate batter for deep frying... DIRECTIONS:

BEER!  Whether it's ale, lager, pilsener, or stout, is terrific for
cooking. Beer makes a batter for deep frying and smooths a French
onion soup.  And what could be more compatible for lunch on a rainy
Vancouver weekend out on the boat fishing for Spring salmon than a
cold beer with a hot pastrami sandwich smothered with brown beer
mustard?

This is the late James Beard's recipe for batter to French fry
vegetables. Trim your veggies, wash, dry thoroughly, dust with flour,
dip into the batter, and fry in oil at 360 F. until done. However,
James "missed the boat" on this one - it's far better for deep frying
halibut, cod, or any other seafood.  The batter puffs up because of
the beer's yeast, fries quickly, and as a result, doesn't commit the
cardinal sin of seafood preparation - overcooking.  I think few of
our piscine friends benefit from deep frying as a cooking method, but
that's another story.

To prepare, place flour in a mixing bowl and add egg yolks, salt,
oil, and beer.  Stir batter until thoroughly mixed. Cover bowl with
plastic wrap and allow it to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours
or as long as 24 - the longer the better, to a point. Just before
using batter, stir it well again.  In a separate bowl, beat egg
whites until stiff but not dry; gently fold egg whites into batter.
Does 2 lbs. of veggies or 6 fish fillets, depending upon their size.

2 1/4 cup unsifted all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs, beaten
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup beer

Oil for deep frying Confectioners sugar mixed with ground cinnamon

Pour the flour and salt into a bowl and make a crater. Into the

spoon, then turn out of bowl onto a heavily floured surface. Knead
until mixture is a firm dough.  Let stand, covered, for 1 hour.

Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4
inch (1/2 cm).  Use a cutter or knife to cut the dough into any
shapes you wish: squares, rectangles, crescents, hearts etc.

Heat the oil to 375 F. (190 C).

Fry the fritters in hot oil for about 3 to 4 minutes turning to brown
on both sides.  Remove when they are the proper shade of golden brown.

Drain on absorbent paper and sprinkle with a mixture of confectioner's
sugar and cinnamon.

These may be served as dessert; but they are also delicious at

Berry Cobbler

deserts

1/2 cup sugar (for sprinkling)
4 cup berries (fresh or frozen)
1 cup sugar (for the batter)
1 cup flour, all-purpose
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup butter (softened)
1  nutmeg

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of sugar on the
berries and place them in the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish. Combine the
remaining dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder and salt).

Add the milk and softened butter and beat well.  Spoon the batter over the
berries.  Sprinkle some nutmeg on top.  Bake for about 45 minutes.

NOTES:

*  Berry cobbler -- This recipe was lifted from _TV Guide's_ series of
recipes from television stars. It is similar to the recipe for Berry
Pudding found in Edna Staebler's "Food That Really Schmecks" cookbook.

*  You can use pretty well any type of berry for the base.  A favourite of
mine is a combination of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries.

*  The base of this turns out to be a bit thin and liquidy.  If you strain
the juice from the fruit, add a couple of tablespoons of flour to the
juice, and then pour the juice over the fruit in the baking dish, the base
will be semi-firm.

*  You do not need to sprinkle the full 1/2 cup of sugar on the berries;
with sweeter berries, much less will often suffice.

*  If you would like a sweeter, candy-like batter, try adding more sugar to
the batter.  I wouldn't recommend putting more than about 1 1/4 cups of
sugar into the batter, though, the crust of the batter will be very
candy-like, but the centre of the batter will not properly bake if you do.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Besan Barfee

candy, ethnic, indian, oriental

6 oz chick pea flour; 1 1/4 c 180 g. also call
1 cup vegetable oil; 8 fl oz.
14 oz sugar; 1 1/2 c or 395 g
1/2 teaspoon cardamom seeds; ground
2 tablespoon pistachios; unsalted up to 3 tbsp li
1 tablespoon almonds, blanched; coarsely chopped  up to

Anne's note: The original recipe measures the dry ingredients by
weight; these are the most accurate measures (I converted it to
volume measures).

Sift the chick pea flour. Heat oil in a heavy, 10-12" frying pan, wok
or saute pan over a medium flame. Put in the sifted chick pea flour.
Stir and fry 2 to 3 minutes until the flour turns a shade darker and
is cooked (it should taste fried, not raw). Put the flour into a
large bowl, stir at once and allow to cool.

Make a syrup with 1 cup/8 fl oz/1/4 litre water and the 14 oz/1 1/3
c/395 g. sugar by bringing the water-sugar combination to a boil and
then simmering very gently for about 20 minutes or until the syrup
reaches a one thread consistency. (To test this, dip in a wooden
spoon and let coat slightly. Pinch some syrup off the back of the
spoon with two fingers and then try separating the fingers. One
sticky thread should form. This is the Indian method. If you have a
better one, use it.)

Pour the hot syrup in the cooled chick pea flour/gram flour mixture.
add the ground cardamom seeds and the nuts and mix well. keep
stirring until mixture begins to harden slightly. (It should still be
pourable.) Pour into a 9 inch square cake tin, tilt tin so barfee
mixture flows to the edges and allow to cool. Cut into 3/4 inch
cubes. besan barfee if tightly wrapped in aluminium foil and then
placed in a plastic container, freezes very well.

Bienenstich

deserts, ethnic, german

1  pastry
3 1/2 oz (100g) cottage cheese, well
1 pressed out
4 tablespoon milk
4 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoon heaping of sugar
1 pinch salt
7 oz (200g) flour
4 teaspoon baking powder
1  topping:
1 3/4 oz to 2 1/2 (50-75g)butter
3 1/2 oz (100g) sugar
1 packet vanillin sugar
1 tablespoon milk
3 1/2 oz (100g) almonds (blanched and
1 thinly sliced)

For the Pastry:  rub the cottage cheese, if desired, through a fine

Bittersweet Temptation

deserts

175 gm crme fraiche
1 tablespoon orange marmalade
1 whisky (optional) 
1 icing sugar

The unusual flavour of orange marmalade balances the fresh creaminess
of crme fraiche, heightened if you like with a little whisky. The
dessert is frozen lightly just before serving - and it is temptation
indeed.

Whisk the crme fraiche and stir in the marmalade. Lace with a little
whisky, to taste, if desired. Put into two little dishes and freeze
lightly - about 1 hour. Sprinkle with a little icing sugar before
serving.

BLACKPOOL ROCK...:)

candy

2 lb moist sugar
1/2 pint water
1 cream of tartar
1  colouring
1 flavoring essence
1 tartaric acid
1 dash golden syrup
1 all british sizes - sorry!

Blackpool Rock is exported all over the world and is famous for having
names running right through it.  The method of adding the names is
beyond the scope of written explanations, and would take an actual
demonstration to learn.
To 'PULL' Sugar To pull sugar takes some
learning but can be mastered:) Turn the cooked sugar on to a oiled
slab and leave until cool enough to handle. Oil your hands, and
working quickly, pull between the hands until it acquires a lighter
colour and a satin finish. As it begins to set the mix is rolled into
a long cylinders shape and cut with a sharp knife or scissors.

Dissolve sugar in the water, add a good 3/4 ts cream of tartar, and
boil to 'Large Crack' degree [312f.]. Pour onto an oiled slab and add
coloring and flavoring. ie: Red colour for raspberry or strawberry,
yellow with pineapple essence.  Add just a pinch of tartaric acid and
the golden syrup. Work well following the directions for 'Pulling
Sugar' above.

If you you want  traditional looking rock: Set aside a small portion
and colour it red.  Roll it out thin and wrap the flavoured/coloured
mix inside it.  Lots of skill needed to get it right. Asbestos
fingers are also helpful if you wish to avoid burns. From Ron's
Plaice. Home of Blackpool Rock:)

Blueberry & Lemon Crumb Bars

deserts

1  crust--
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour --
1  unbleached
2 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon grated lemon rind
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cold butter -- cut in 1/4
1  slices
1 large egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon cold water -- optional
1  filling--
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour --
1  unbleached
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
2 cup blueberries -- rinsed and
1  sorted
1  topping--
5 tablespoon soft butter
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
3/4 cup all-purpose flour --
1  unbleached
1 confectioner's sugar

Oven 400F / 200C. Butter is unsalted unless otherwise stated. Lightly
butter a 13- x 9-inch baking pan. TO MAKE THE CRUST: Combine flour,
sugar, lemon zest and salt in the bowl of a food processor. With the
motor running, add pads of cold butter, a few at a time. In a small
cup, stir together the egg yolk and vanilla. With the motor running,
gradually add the yolk mixture; process until the mixture pulls
together. If the mixture seems dry, add some to all of the cold
water. Turn dough out (it will be crumbly) into the prepared pan;
with floured fingertips, carefully press the dough into an even layer
over the bottom of the pan. TO MAKE THE FILLING: In a large bowl,
stir together the sugar, flour and nutmet until blended. Add the
blueberries; stir to coat. Spread the blueberry-sugar mixture into an
even layer over the crust. TO MAKE TOPPING: Work the butter and sugar
together with a wooden spool until blending. Using a fork, gradually
add the flour, stirring until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the blueberries. BAKE for 15
minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees, and back for 25
to 30 minutes longer, or until the edges and topping are browned and
the blueberries are cooked. Cool on a wire rack before cutting into
bars. Lightly sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving.

~ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : Marie likes to make these bars in midsummer when the
blueberry crop is at its peak, but frozen berries may be used; the
bars will be a little more moist. As the bars bake, the butter crust,
sugared blueberries and brown-sugar crumb topping melt together. The
result is a just-sweet-enough fruit bar that is perfect with a tall
glass of lemonade or ice tea (or so says Marie, who is a Bon Appetit
columnist and author/editor of several cookbooks.)

Blueberry Lemon Cobbler

deserts, fruits/nuts

      ----BUTTERMILK BISCUIT CRUST----
3 cup self-rising cake flour
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1 1/4 cup buttermilk
      ----FILLING----
3 pint blueberries  rinsed and picked over
3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoon unsalted butter
      ----FOR FINISHING----
1  buttermilk
1  sugar

FOR THE DOUGH: Place flour in a bowl and rub in butter until fine and
mealy. Do not allow to become pasty. Stir in 1 cup of the buttermilk,
adding the remainder if necessary. Press dough together on a floured
surface, wrap and allow to rest while preparing filling.

FOR THE FILLING: Preheat oven to 450F and set rack in the middle
level. Place blueberries in a bowl and add remaining filling
ingredients, except butter. Toss well to combine and pour filling
into a 2-quart gratin dish or other baking dish. Distribute pieces of
the butter evenly on the filling. On a floured surface, with the
palms of the hands, press out the dough to the size of the baking
dish and slide a thin cookie sheet under it. Slide the dough onto the
filling. Cut 3 or 4 vent holes in the crust with the point of a
knife. Paint the top crust evenly with the buttermilk and sprinkle
with sugar. Bake the cobbler about 20 minutes, until crust is well
colored and filling is bubbling. Cool slightly on a rack and serve
warm or at room temperature with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

Boiled Plumb Pudding

deserts, fruits

1 lb suet
1 lb currants
1 lb raisins
8  egg
4 egg white
6 cup bread crumbs
1 tablespoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon ginger
1  salt
1 lb flour
1 pint milk

Cut suet in little pieces.  Beat the eggs, then half the milk, beat
them together, and by degrees stir in the flour and bread together,
then the suet, spice and fruit, and as much milk as will mix it all
well together and very thick.

Wet a large muslin cloth (3 foot square) and rub with flour inside
and out. Drape it into a bowl large enough to hold the pudding mix.
Pour the mixture in and tie up the muslin ends tightly, leaving the
pudding in a large ball with some room for expansion. When tying the
neck, leave long enough ends on the cords so you can knot a loop.
Suspend the pudding in a large kettle or stock pot of boiling water,
hanging the loop from a long wooden spoon straddling the open top of
the pot, and boil five hours. Check water level frequently.  It
evaporates quickly.

When done, wrap in a clean muslin cloth and douse with 1/4 cup rum or
brandy.  Check weekly and add additional rum or brandy if it appears
dry.

Bougatsa

deserts, greek

1 karen mintzias
1/2 lb cream cheese
1 lb fresh ricotta cheese
1 lb fresh lg-curd cottage cheese
1 granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
18 sheets commercial filo
1/2 cup butter (or more); melted

Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese at high speed until
light and fluffy.  Lower the speed and add the ricotta, cottage
cheese, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, and the nutmeg. Beat for 1 minute at
high speed, then set aside while you prepare the filo.
Lay the filo flat on a table and keep covered with a damp towel
over waxed paper or plastic wrap.  By stacking 4 sheets, form a base
of 15 x 18 inches, brushing the top of each sheet with melted butter
as you stack them.  Then lay 2 sheets at right angles over the
center, using the "base" as a diamond, not a square, brushing the
center of each with butter. Divide the filling into 3 parts and
spread one part over the filo to form a 7-inch square.  Set the rest
of the filling aside. Fold the top filo sheet over the cheese and
brush with butter, and continue folding the filo over the cheese to
make a square, brushing each time with butter. With a wide spatula,
lift the bougatsa and invert onto a cookie sheet. Brush the top with
butter and set aside.
Repeat with the remaining filo, filling until all 3 square pies
are folded.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until
the filo puffs up and turns a golden chestnut color. Cut into small
squares and sprinkle with additional sugar.  Serve piping hot.

6 large baking apples; cored
1/2 cup unsalted butter; cut in small pieces
3/4 cup brown sugar; firmly packed
3/4 cup bourbon
3/4 cup light cream
1 tablespoon vanella
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Preheat oven to 350 deg. Remove a strip of peel from around the top
of each apple with a vegetable peeler. Set the apples upright in a
flameproof baking pan just large enough to accomodate them. Top the
apples with the butter; sprinkle with brown sugar, then drizzle with
the bourbon over all. Bake until the apples are puffed and tender,
basting them occasionally with the pan juices, 30 to 35 min. Transfer
the apples to a platter and keep warm.  Stir the cream into the
baking pan and set over high heat. Bring to a boil, then lower the
heat to medium high and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce is
reduced by half and coats a spoon, 7 - 10 min. Remove the sauce from
the heat and stir in the vanilla and lemon juice. Spoon the sauce
onto dessert plates and set an apple in the center of each one and
serve immediately. Per serving: 302 cal, 10 gr fat, 26 mil. chol, 7

Brandied Pumpkin & Quince Cobbler

deserts, fruits

2 cup quince (about 1 lg quince)
2 lb sugar pumpkin
1/4 cup brandy
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup currants
1/2 teaspoon salt
      ----DOUGH----
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
4 tablespoon unsalted butter
3/4 cup buttermilk
      ----SYRUP----
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 tablespoon maple syrup
2 tablespoon pecans

Preheat  oven to 375 degrees. Peel and coarsely grate the quince.
Peel, seed, and cut into 1-inch dice the pumpkin to yield 3 cups.
Toast and coarsely chop the pecans.

Combine the quince, Pumpkin, brandy, orange juice, white and brown
sugars, the currants and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a shallow 2-quart baking dish; let cool. The
dough: Combine the flour, salt, sugar, baking powder and soda in a
food processor. Pulse a couple of times to combine. Drop in the
butter and pulse 4 to 5 times.  Pour in the buttermilk and pulse just
until combined. (The mixture should be moist but not wet.)

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and pat out to a
1-inch thickness.

Cut into squares or triangles and place, in an almost scattered
manner, over the cooled fruit mixture, leaving spaces between the
pieces for steam to escape.

The syrup: Combine the syrup ingredients in a saucepan and heat until
the butter melts.  Pour over the cobbler.

Place the pan on a cookie sheet (to catch run-overs) and bake for 30
minutes, or until the fruit is bubbling and the dough has risen and is
golden brown.

Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Pass a bowl of whipped cream at the table, if desired. Serves 8.

Brazil Nut Torte

deserts

1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon double acting baking powder
2 cup fine graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup soft shortening
1 cup granulated sugar
3 egg yolks
3/4 cup chopped brazil nuts
1 teasp. vanilla extract
1  milk*
3 egg whites stiffly beaten
1 pkg vanilla-pudding pie filling
1 1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped

Day before: Start heating oven to 375ø F. With waxed paper, line
bottoms of 2 1 1/4"-deep 8" layer pans. Sift together flour and
baking powder; add cracker crumbs. With electric mixer at medium
speed, or "cream" (or with spoon), thoroughly mix shortening with
sugar, then with yolks, until very light and fluffy--about 4 min.
altogether. Add nuts and vanilla. Then, at low speed, or "blend",
beat in flour mixture alternately with indicated amount of milk*,
beating after each addition. Quickly fold in egg whites. Turn into
pans. Bake 30 min., or till done. Cool in pans on wire rack.
Meanwhile, combine vanilla pudding with 1 1/2 cups milk. Cook,
stirring, over medium heat until mixture comes to boil. Remove from
heat; pour into bowl; place waxed paper directly on surface of
pudding. Refrigerate.

The day: Beat pudding until smooth; fold in whipped cream. Split each
cake layer- spread filling between layers and on top of cake.
Refrigerate at least 1 hr.

*With butter, margarine, or lard, use 1 cup milk. With vegetable or
any other shortening, use 1 cup plus 1 cup plus 2 tablesp. milk.

Bread & Butter Pudding

puddings

1 loaf bread-not whole grain
1/2 lb butter
1 pint milk
1/2 pint cream
4 teaspoon cinnamon
4 teaspoon nutmeg
6 tablespoon sugar -- up to 8
1  tablespoons
1 raisins -- 2 handfuls
2 eggs -- per pint of liquid

1.   Slice the bread and butter on both sides 2. Line a deep oven
proof dish 3. Put in one handful of the dried fruit 4. Sprinkle on a
third of the sugar, third of the spices 5. Add a layer of bread 6.
Repear numbers 3, 4 and 5. 7. Whisk up eggs and milk and cream 8.
Pour over the bread, enough to not quite cover all the bread 9. Let
it stand for half an hour to an hour to soak 10. Sprinkle some sugar
on the top as this will caramelise in the oven and give a crunchy
topping 11. Put in a medium oven for about an hour

Alternatively, you can add a wee bit of vanilla essence to the milk,
or heat the milk with a vanilla pod.

Once you've made it once you'll be able to judge how much extra spice,
sugar and dried fruit you'd like in it.

Bread Pudding (Brandywyne Restaurant)

deserts

1 lb sweet bread, cubed, oven dri
1/2 lb raisins
1 teaspoon cinnamon
8 oz sugar
8 each eggs
3 oz melted butter
1/2 lb coconut, shredded
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 quart milk, hot

The bread is important in this recipe.  We use the breakfast
pastries croissants here, but you can use any bread that is not
pre-sliced. The one I would recommend is an egg yellow color inside.
Cut it into large cubes, toast in oven in single layer til they're
like croutons. Place them in the pan you will be baking in. It should
be 2/3rds full. Add the raisins and coconut & toss.  Drizzle top of
all with the melted butter. Whip eggs till beaten, gradually add the
hot milk, then add sugar and spices and vanilla. Pour over bread
mixture and place in a water bath ( a larger pan than the pudding
pan- water filled 1/2 way up the outer rim of bread pudding pan).
Bake in 375 oven for 45 minutes to an hour. You should feel the
center of the pudding to be sure it is set. You can serve warm with
whipped cream or chilled as you prefer. Makes one pan, 8 X 10-inches

dish in pan of water and bake at 300 degrees for 40-50 minutes, or
until a silver knife inserted comes out clean.  Make meringue adding
2 level tablespoons sugar to each egg white. Spread, and return to
350 degree oven until brown (browning in a slow oven prevents
falling). Serve warm WHISKEY SAUCE: Cook until dissolved.  Remove
from heat, add whiskey to individual taste. From "Talk About Good"
Submitted by Mrs. Henry Gauthier, Sr. I haven't tried this one, but
it sure looks good. It is quite different, what with the meringue,
than that served up at Prejeans.

Bread Pudding With Whiskey Sauce-Bon Ton Cafe

cajun, puddings

      ----BREAD PUDDING----
1 loaf french bread
1 quart milk
3  eggs
2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup raisins
3 tablespoon melted margarine
      ----WHISKEY SAUCE----
1 cup sugar
1 stick butter (or margarine)
1  egg, beaten
2 oz bourbon whiskey or southern comfort; rum also works well

This is the classic New Orleans bread pudding, as prepared at the Bon
Ton Cafe on Magazine Street. I consider it a quintessential version,
but there are many possible variations: you can enrich it by using
half-and-half instead of milk, and an extra egg; you can add
different fruits, nuts, etc.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Tear bread into chunks and soak in milk.
Crush with hands to make sure milk has soaked through. Add eggs,
sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, raisins and stir well. Pour melted
margarine or butter in bottom of a heavy 9 x 14 baking pan. Add bread
mixture (and I sprinkle more cinnamon and raisins on top) and bake
until very firm, about 40 mins. Cool pudding, cube it and put it into
individual dessert dishes. When ready to serve, add whiskey sauce and
heat under broiler for a few minutes (last step optional).

Whiskey sauce

A variation that I like is to use Southern Comfort for the sauce
instead of whiskey. Cream sugar and butter and cook in a
double-boiler until very hot and well-dissolved. Add well-beaten egg
very slowly and whip very fast so egg doesn't curdle. Cool and add
liquor. Walt MM

Bread Pudding-West Texas Style

deserts

1/2 cup rainins
1 cup brandy
10 slice whole wheat bread (or more)
1/2 cup pecans, toasted & chopped
1 cup grated cheddar cheese
1 cup sugar
3 1/2 cup water, hot
3 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 dash nutmeg
1 dash ground corriander
1 dash cloves
      ----TOPPING----
1 cup whipping cream
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

The day before, put raisins into a small bowl and pour brandy over
them. Cover loosely and let stand overnight. Next day, preheat oven
to 350 F. Butter a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Dice bread and put it in
dish. Add pecans and cheese to the bread and toss. Scatter the
raisins over the top, drizzling on any brandy that has not been
soaked up by raisins. Pour the sugar into a large heavy saucepan.
Warm it over medium heat, stirring to facilitate even heating, until
it melts and turns a deep golden brown. Pour in the water, carefully
because steam will rise rapidly as water hits the sugar.  The mixture
will begin to solidify.

Stirring, cook until the mixture is liquid again. Add butter,
vanilla, and spices to syrup.  Ladle the caramel carefully over
bread. Syrup should be about level with tops of the bread. If any
bread pcs. are not covered, push them down into the liquid.

Bake 20 to 25 min. until syrup is absorbed and cheese has melted
into the pudding.

Beat whipping cream, adding sugar and vanilla. Spoon pudding into
serving dishes, and dollop whipped cream on top.

Busy Day Cobbler

deserts

1/4 cup butter (or margarine, if you must)
1/2 cup sugar
2/3 cup milk
1 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
13 oz tart cherries (one normal u.s. can)
2 tablespoon sugar (to sweeten and thicken; use less or more as neede

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Drain cherries, saving liquid.

Cream butter and sugar together.  Alternately add in milk and sifted dry
ingredients.  Pour into a buttered and floured casserole dish. Top evenly
with cherries.  Sprinkle sugar on top and cover with saved liquid/juice.
Bake 45-50 minutes.

The batter will expand and surround the cherries so they're evenly mixed
throughout the cobbler.  The juice will congeal to fruity and pudding-like.
Serve warm topped with cream, milk or ice cream.  (I prefer milk). If any
is left, it's good cold, too.

NOTES:

*  An extremely quick cherry cobbler dessert -- This recipe came from a PTA
recipe collection from my Aunt's school a number of years ago. It's not a
true, classic cobbler, but I think it's better.  My favorite dessert!

*  As the name implies, this is a very quick recipe to make. Depending on
how soft the butter is to start with, or whether or if you use a food
processor (I don't, but it should work) this recipe takes only 5 to 10
minutes to mix.

*  You can use any unsweetened canned fruit for this recipe.  You can also
use frozen fruit, by thawing it before adding to the pan. Berries or
peaches are standard substitutes. Yesterday I made one with crushed
pineapple.  I used brown, rather than white sugar atop the fruit. It tasted
very much like pineapple upside down cake (though the appearance was a bit
different).

: Difficulty:  easy, I've been making this since I was about 8 or 9.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

1  envelope unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
1 cup prickly pear juice
1 1/2 cup prickly pear pieces
1/2 cup honey
5 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup whipping cream

Cafe Nut Caramel

deserts

1 can eagle brand condensed milk (caramel; ized)
1/4 cup hot coffee
1/2 cup pecan nut meats

(This recipe earned $25 for Mrs. George H. Plum, 440 Camden Ave.,
Moorestown, New Jersey.)

Blend caramelized Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk (see Magic
Caramel Pudding recipe), and hot coffee, beating until smooth. Chop
pecan nut meats and add. Pour into sherbet glasses. Chill. May be
garnished with whipped cream.  Serves six.

NOTE:  I have just completed assembling the above recipe. Tastes
good. If it sets up a bit more it will make a nice pudding. If it was
heated, it would be nice over a couple of scoops of vanilla ice
cream. No way it's gonna serve six, though.

1 1/4 cup sugar
2 large egg
2 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon cinnamon, ground
8 oz cling peaches, sliced in heavy syru; p
1  banana; mashed
8 oz french bread, day old; cut into 1 inch cubes
1/2 cup lemon peel; cut in 1 by 1/8 inch slic
1/4 cup orange liqueur
3 tablespoon ; water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
      ----BOURBON SAUCE----
2 large egg
1 cup butter; melted
3 1/2 cup sugar, confectioners
1 tablespoon bourbon

Heat oven to 350 F. Grease a 10 inch springform pan. In large bowl,
combine cream, sugar (reserving 2 tablespoons), the eggs, vanilla,
cinnamon, peaches with their syrup, and the banana. Add bread cubes
and let sit until bread has absorbed most of the liquid- 5 minutes.

Pour bread mixture into springform pan and bake on rimmed baking
sheet 45 to 50 minutes or until center springs back when lightly
pressed with fingertip. Cool in pan on wire rack 15 minutes. Serve
immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.

In small skillet, heat lemon peel, liqueur, water, lemon juice, and
reserved 2 tablespoons sugar to boiling. Cook until mixture thickens-
about 7 minutes. Strain lemon peel; discard liquid. On small plate,
spread lemon peel in single layer to cool.

Prepare Bourbon Sauce: In top of double boiler, over simmering water,
with wire whisk, beat eggs until they just begin to thicken. Slowly
beat in melted butter until well combined. Remove mixture from heat
and beat in confectioners' sugar and bourbon until smooth.

Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve. If sauce has
been refrigerated, slowly reheat until warm.

To serve, scoop some bread pudding into small serving bowls. Spoon
some warm Bourbon Sauce over bread pudding and top all with some
lemon peel.

One of New Orleans' oldest food establishments, Cafe Sbisa was
founded by the Sbisa family in 1899, in what was then the thriving
port and financial district of the old French city. In 1977, the
business was purchased by two local restauranteurs who completely
restored the historic building and reopened the cafe two years later.
The menu still reflects many of the great traditions of "la cuisine
Creole", but has been expanded to include the finest products from
across the United States.

Cajun-Country Bread Pudding With Rum Sauce &

cajun, deserts

7 tablespoon butter, unsalted; melted
1/4 cup butter, unsalted; melted
16 cup french bread cubes, dry packed
3  eggs
1 1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon nutmeg, grated
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
3 cup milk
3/4 cup sultanas
3/4 cup coconut, flaked
1/2 cup pecans, toasted; coarsely chopped
      ----RUM SAUCE----
1 cup butter, unsalted
1 1/2 cup sugar
2  egg; beaten until frothy
1/2 cup dark rum
      ----SOFT CREAM----
1 pint whipping cream
1/3 cup sugar, confectioners, sifted
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
2 tablespoon cognac
2 teaspoon frangelico liqueur
1/4 cup dairy sour cream

Pour 7 tablespoons butter into a 13" x 9" baking pan; swirl it around
to coat bottom and sides.  Pour excess butter and additional 1/4 cup
butter into a small bowl; set aside. Place bread cubes in buttered
baking dish; set aside.  In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar with an
electric mixer until thickened and light lemon-coloured, 3 to 4
minutes. Add vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, milk, raisins, coconut,
pecans and reserved butter; beat on low speed to combine.  Pour
liquid over bread in baking dish; stir to distribute nuts, coconut
and raisins evenly. Set pan aside until bread has absorbed all of
liquid, 30 to 45 minutes. Press bread down into liquid often to cover
all cubes with liquid. Preheat oven to 350F. Bake in preheated oven
until crusty and golden brown on top, 45 to 60 minutes. While pudding
is baking, prepare Rum Sauce and Soft Cream. Cool bread pudding to
lukewarm.  When bread pudding has cooled, slice into squares. Place a
spoonful of rum sauce in botttom of each serving bowl; add a square
of bread pudding.  Top with a generous dollop of cream. Makes 15 to
18 servings.

TO PREPARE RUM SAUCE, using an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar
mixture until light and fluffy.  Put mixture in top of a double
boiler over simmering water; cook 20 minutes, whisking often. The
mixture should be silky smooth and light in colour.  Whisk 2
tablespoons hot butter mixture into beaten eggs, then 2 tablespoons
more. Whisk warmed egg mixture slowly into remaining butter mixture.
Cook mixture over barely simmering water until thickened, 4 to 5
minutes, whisking constantly. Cool slightly; whisk in rum. Sauce may
be kept warm over hot water until served.

TO PREPARE SOFT CREAM, chill beaters and a medium bowl until very
cold. Place all ingredients in bowl; beat with an electric mixer on
medium- high speed until soft, loose peaks from, 3 to 4 minutes. The
cream should have a slightly runny, cloud-like consistency that
softly drapes over the bread pudding.  Do not overbeat. Cover tightly
and refrigerate until served.

"I know of no dessert that gives me greater pleasure than the bread
pudding desserts I discovered during my trips to Louisiana. This
version is light and airy rather than heavy and dense. It has an
exciting combination of tastes and textures to please your mouth. It
is sinfully rich and guaranteed to please the most ardent dessert
fan. I'm sure you will enjoy this as much as I did."

Canadian Date Squares

deserts

1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 cup flour
2 cup oatmeal
1/4 teaspoon baking soda

Cream the butter and shortening; gradually add the brown sugar, then
the flour, oatmeal and soda. This will give you a very stiff dough,
which you will have to knead with the hands to work smooth. Do not be
tempted to add liquid.If it will not hold to-gether its because the
shortening and butter were not sufficiently well creamed. Divide into
two portions and roll half to 1/4 in. thickness and spread out on
bottom of a greased pan. Cover with following date mixture: 1/2 cup
of dates chopped, 1/2 cup brown sugar, one tblsp. cornstarch, 1 cup
of hot water. Cook till thick stirring constantly. Spread over
oatmeal mixture and roll second oatmeal portion and put on top. Bake
about 1 hour in 350 oven.

Candied Grapefruit

candy, deserts, fruits/nuts

3  plump, pink grapefruit,  preferably; organic
2 1/2 cup sugar
1 1/4 cup water
2 tablespoon corn syrup
1  superfine sugar; for coating
5 oz semisweet chocolate
1 tablespoon butter

SCORE GRAPEFRUIT INTO QUARTERS and carefully pull off peels or juice
fruits and cut halves again in half. Place peels in large pan, cover
them with cold water and bring to boil. Simmer 25 minutes. Remove
peels and let them cool until they are easy to handle. Hold peels
firmly against counter and gently scrape away most of white pith just
below skin. Cut cleaned peels into strips with knife or scissors as
narrow or wide as you like. In 2-quart saucepan, mix together sugar,
water and corn syrup. Bring to boil. When syrup is clear, add peels,
lower heat and cook slowly until peels are translucent, about 1 hour.
Set cake rack over baking sheet. Remove peels a few at a time and
spread them out on rack to drain about 15 minutes. While they are
draining, thickly cover large plate with super- fine sugar. Set
several pieces at a time in sugar and turn them to coat them. When
evenly coated, set them aside on another plate or piece of parchment
paper thinly coated with sugar. This process will need to be done in
several batches. If sugar become lumpy with beads of syrup, pass it
through a strainer, then continue using it. Set aside sugared peels
about 1 hour or until they are dried. Carefully package them in tin
or plastic container and store either in cupboard or refrigerator. To
dip peels in chocolate, melt semisweet chocolate over simmering water
along with butter. Stir well to ensure that mixture is smooth before
removing from heat. Dip each rind into chocolate, coating most of it
but leaving a little "handle" to grasp. Or, completely immerse each
rind in chocolate, then remove with 2 forks or pair of chopsticks.
Set slices on parchment paper or cake rack and place in cool place to
harden. Once chocolate has set, pieces can be stored in refrigerator.
Chocolate will discolor when it cools but will become dark and glossy
again once brought to room temperature. Makes 3 Cups

Cannoli Siciliana

deserts, italian

1  ****dough****
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour; sifted
5 tablespoon marsala; (or use any other fortifi
1 tablespoon superfine sugar
1 pinch salt
12  metal cannoli tubes; (cannoli forms may be mad
1  fat for deep frying
1  ****filling****
2 cup ricotta cheese; as fresh as possible
1/2 cup superfine sugar
1/4 cup candied fruit; citron, orange peel, etc.
1/4 cup pistachio nuts; coarsely chopped
1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate; cut in fine dice (optiona
1 teaspoon vanilla extract or
1  orange flower water; optional

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the center, and
add the wine and sugar.  Work the flour into the center until you
have a rather firm dough, something like noodle dough. If the dough
is too crumbly add more wine, but do not let it become sticky. Place
dough on a lightly floured pastry cloth or board and knead it and
pound it vigorously for about 15 minutes.  It should be perfectly
smooth by then. Form it into a ball, wrap in a clean, slightly
dampened cloth, and let it rest for 2 hours.  When it has rested,
roll it out on the pastry cloth or board until very thin (no more
than 1/16 inch). Cut it into 5-inch squares and roll it around the
metal tubes as follows: take a square and place it before you diamond
fashion; one of the points toward you. Place the tube vertically
across the middle of the diamond, each end at a point of the dough.
Fold the sides over the tube, moistening the overlap with a little
water and pressing together.  When all the squares have been thus
rolled, place them, a few at a time, into deep fat preheated to 375
degrees F. Remove them when they are golden brown (tongs are best for
this, as the rolls are fragile) and let them drain on absorbent
paper. When they are cool, slip off the tubes, and fill with the
ricotta filling.

Press the ricotta through a fine sieve into a bowl. Beat it until it
is creamy and smooth.  Beat in the rest of the ingredients with a
large fork. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tube (or
merely use the nozzle, without a tube) and pipe the filling into the
cooled shells. Makes 12 cannoli.  Source: Great Italian Cooking by

Caprioled (Sopa)

deserts

1  stephen ceideburg
12 slice french bread, crusts removed
2 teaspoon butter
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup water
1 cup apple juice
1 oz butter
1/2 cup raisins
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
6 oz cream cheese
1/4 cup pecan pieces
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup whipping cream
2 tablespoon powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

This recipe is a combination of one given to me by the Santa Fe
School of Cooking and one tasted at the Border Grill in Los Angeles.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Tear
bread into bite-sized pieces and place in baking dish.

Toast in oven for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, over medium high heat, stir
the sugar continuously in a saucepan until it melts and turns a light
caramel color. Immediately add the water and apple juice.

Be careful; the caramel will bubble and splatter. Do not bend over
the pan when you do this! The caramel will partially solidify but
will liquefy again as you heat it. Add the butter and raisins. When
caramel is completely liquefied, remove from heat and stir in the
vanilla.

Pour mixture over the bread pieces in the baking dish. Make sure all
of the bread is well soaked with caramel. Place tablespoons of the
cream cheese throughout the bread. Sprinkle the top with pecans and
cinnamon.

Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 to 26 minutes, or until all but a
little of the caramel at the bottom of the dish is ab sorbed.

Lightly whip the cream. Add the sugar and vanilla. Serve the pudding
warm with the sweetened cream.

Note: You may add a peeled, chopped apple or pear to the pudding
before it is baked.

Caramel Custard

deserts

1 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
1  for the custard:
3  eggs
3  egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 cup half and half

FOR THE CARAMEL: Heat the oven to 375F. For the caramel, combine the
sugar and water in a small saucepan. Swirl the pan until the sugar is
dissolved, then cover the pan and cook over medium high heat until
thick and large bubbles form. Uncover the pan, and cook until a rich,
brown color. Watch the caramel, since it burns very quickly once it
begins to color. Pour the syrup into the bottom of a mold, and rotate
to cover the bottom and up a few inches of the sides evenly. Set
aside. For the custard, whisk the eggs, yolks and sugar in a mixing
bowl. Heat the vanilla, milk and half and half until hot to the
touch, about 150F. Slowly add this to the egg mixture, and pour into
the prepared mold. Place the mold in a baking pan, and place in the
oven. Pour boiling water into the baking pan so it is half way up the
sides of mold. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until a kniefe inserted
in the center comes out cleam. Cool at room temperature, then
refrigerate and serve chilled. To serve, invert the mold over a
platter with sides to catch the caramel sauce. Note: The custard can
be made up to two days in advance. If made in advance, refrigerate,
covered with plastic wrap.

Caramel Fried Apples Or Bananas

bananas, chinese, deserts

1/2 cup all purpose flour
2 tablespoon cornstarch
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup water
2  golden delicious apples -or-
2  bananas
1  salad oil
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup warm water
1 tablespoon salad oil
2 teaspoon sesame seeds

In a bowl, mix flour, cornstarch, and baking powder. Add water and
stir until smooth.  Peel and core apples; cut each apple into 3
wedges. (If you use bananas, peel and cut in 1/2 inch thick diagonal
slices.) Place fruit in batter and turn to coat evenly. Into a deep
pan pour oil to a depth of about 1 1/2 inches. Heat oil to 350
degrees. Using chopsticks or a spoon, lift one piece of fruit at a
time from batter and let excess batter drip off, then lower fruit
into hot oil. Cook several pieces at a time until coating is golden
brown (about 2 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on
paper towels. Generously oil a flat serving dish. Fill a serving bowl
to the brim with ice cubes; cover with water. Place sugar, water and
oil in a ten inch frying pan; stir to blend. Place pan over high
heat. When mixture begins to bubble (about one minute), shake pan
continuously to prevent burning.  Continue cooking and shaking pan
until syrup *just* turns a pale straw color (about 9 minutes).
Immediately remove from heat, add sesame seeds, and swirl to mix.
(Syrup will continue to cook after you remove it from heat and color
will turn golden in a few seconds.) Drop fruit into syrup and swirl
to coat evenly. Using two spoons, immediately remove each piece of
fruit and place on oiled dish so pieces do not touch. At table, dip
each piece of fruit in ice water so coating hardens and fruit cools.
Serve.

Caramel Turtle Truffle Tart

candy, deserts

1  stick (4 ozs) butter; cut into 8 pieces
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cup flour
1  egg
1 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips (9 ozs)
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup heavy cream
1 pkg (14 oz.) vanilla caramels
3 cup chopped pecans

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. To make crust, in a food processor,
combine butter, sugar, and vanilla. Process 1 minute. Add flour and
process to blend. With machine on, add egg through feed tube, and
process just until dough forms and leaves sides of bowl.
Press dough evenly into bottom and all the way up sides of an
11-inch fluted metal tart pan with a removable bottom. Press a sheet
of foil on top of crust and line with pie weights or dried beans.
Bake 10 minutes. Remove foil and weights and bake 5 to 7 minutes
longer, or until golden. Let cool.
Meanwhile, prepare truffle mixture. In a 1-quart glass bowl,
combine chocolate chips and 1/3 cup cream. Heat in a microwave oven
on High 1 to 1-1/4 minutes, or until chocolate is melted and smooth
when stirred. When crust is cool, spread three-quarters of truffle
mixture evenly over bottom of crust. Refrigerate 15 minutes, or until
truffle mixture is set.
In a large skillet, combine caramels and remaining 1/2 cup cream.
Heat over medium-low heat, stirring often, until caramels are melted
and mixture is smooth, about 3 minutes. Stir in pecans. Spread evenly
over chilled truffle mixture.
Heat remaining chocolate truffle mixture in microwave oven on High
15 to 20 seconds, if necessary, to melt. Drizzle with a fork over top
of tart. Refrigerate until filling is set, at least 1 hour. Before
serving, remove side of pan, and using a sharp knife, cut tart into
slices.

COMMENTS: This caramel tart, which tastes almost like a piece of
candy, is a breeze to prepare with store-bought caramels. Pile the
caramel-pecan mixture on top of a chocolate truffle mixture spread on
a butter cookie crust.

Caramelized Apple Galette

deserts, fruits

1 1 recipe quick puff pastry
:  -(recipe follows)
1 1 northern spy, or
:  other firm baking apple

1/4 c  Sugar
2 TB Unsalted Butter
1 TB Calvados -- french apple
:          brandy

On a lightly floured work surface, roll out an eighth of quick puff
pastry dough recipe to about 1/8 inch thickness. Using a sharp
parking knife, cut dough into a circle about 7 1/2 inches in
diameter. Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet, and place in
refrigerator to chill about 15 minutes. Heat oven to 425F. Place the
chilled pastry dough in a heavy cast iron skillet that measure 6 1/2
inches in diameter at the bottom. Peel, core and slice the apple in
half lengthwise. Using a mandoline or very sharp knife, slice apple
halves, widthwise into twenty five 1/8 inch slices. Arrange the
slices in a neat fanned pattern, overlapping he apples, keeping them
1/2 inch in from the edge of the pastry dough, fill in the center
with smaller or broken apple slices as you create the fanned out
circle. Sprinkle two tablespoons sugar over the apples, and dot with
1 tablespoon butter, cut into very small pieces. Place skillet in the
oven, and bake until the pstry has puffed up along the edges of te
pan and is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove the skillet from
the oven. Using a spatula remove the tart from the skillet, and
transfer to a plate, set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon butter
to the skillet, and place over medium heat. Add the remaining 2
tablespoons sugar, and cook until the sugar dissolves and forms a
light caramel, about 5 minutes. Measure Calvados into a glass then
pour into the caramel, cook out the alcohol, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Return the tart to the skillet, apple side down and cook 4 to 5
minutes, until the caramel bubbles up over the tart, and starts to
look a litle thick. Remove the skillet from theheat, and carefully
invert the tart onto a plate large enough to catch the hot caramel as
it drips out of the skillet.

Quick Puff Pastry Makes 2 lbs
1 3/4    cup all purpose flour 2 cups cake flour 1 teaspoon salt 2
cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, very cold, cut into small pieces 1
cup to 1 1/4 cups ice water 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Sift together the all purpose flour, cake flour and salt into a large
chilled bowl. Cut in the pieces of butter, using a pastry knife until
the butter is in very small lumps, about 1/2 inch in diameter.
Combine the ice water and lemon juice, and stir into the flour
mixture, a little at a time pressing the dough together with your
hands until it comes together. Turn the dough out onto a well floured
work surface and roll it into a 1/2 inch thick rough rectangle,
approximately 12 by 18 inches. The dough will be very crumbly. Fold
bottomof the rectangle toward the center, then the top of the
rectangle toward the center, overlapping the bottom third, like a
letter, and give the dough a quarter turn to the right. Roll the
dough into a large rectangle, 1/2 inch thick and fold into thirds
again. This completes the first double turn. Remove any excess flour
with a wide dry brush.  Repeat rolling, folding, and turning process
two more times to execute another double turn, refrigerating the
dough for a few minutes if the butter becomes too warm. Wrap the
dough in plastic, and put in refrigerator to chill for 1 hour. Remove
chilled dough from the refrigerator.  Repeat rolling, folding, and
turning process again to execture one more double turn. There will be
six turns in all. The dough needsto be rolled out to 1/2 inch thick
rectangle each time.With each turn, the dough will become smoother
and easier to handle. Store the dough, wrapped well in plastic in the
refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for 3 months.

3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2  egg yolks
14 oz can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon instant coffee granules

Source: Southwest Cooks! The Tradition of Native American Cuisines

Place sugar in a small heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon, until sugar crystallizes into lumps
(about 15 minutes). Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until
sugar melts and turns a light golden brown (about 15 minutes).
Quickly pour hot caramel mixture into an ungreased 8-inch round
cakepan, tilting to coat bottom evenly. Set aside (mixture will
harden).

Combine eggs and remaining ingredients in a large bowl; beat with a
wire whisk until coffee granules dissolve. Pour egg mixture over
caramelized sugar in cakepan.

Place cakepan in a large shallow baking dish. Pour hot water into
outer baking dish to a depth of 1-inch. Cover with aluminum foil, and
bake at 350 degrees F. for 55 minutes or until a knife inserted near
center of flan comes out clean. Remove pan from water, and let cool.
Cover and chill at least 8 hours.

To serve, loosen edge of custard with a spatula, and invert onto a
serving plate.

Carmeled Peanuts

candy

1 lb peanuts
1  egg white
1 teaspoon cold water
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt

Contributed to the echo by: Kathi Crockett Now, I'd better get a
recipe in here before the troups kick me out. Here's a fun and very
easy party recipe for candied nuts: CARMELED PEANUTS Beat egg white
and water until frothy - not stiff. Add peanuts, stir until they are
well coated. Combine sugar and salt then pour this over the nuts &
eggwhite mixture. Bake at 225 on a greased, tinfoil lined cookie
sheet. Stir every 15 minutes for 1 hour.

This makes a nice, big batch and is delicious. You can also use other
nuts. I first started doing this because I was always at a loss as to
what to do with the leftover nuts from Christmas and this certainly
takes care of them in short order. It's one of those recipes where
you can't eat just one.

Carnival Fritters (Castagnole)

breads, deserts, ethnic

1 cup hot water
8 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
4  eggs
1 teaspoon freshly grated orange rind
1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon rind
4 cup peanut oil
1  confectioners sugar

Combine the water, butter, sugar, and salt in a small sauce pan and
bring to a boil. When butter is melted, add flour. Stir vigorously
with a whisk until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan, a matter
of seconds. Remove from heat and cool slightly.

Add the eggs, one at a time, beating vigorously with a spoon after
each addition. Add the grated orange and lemon rinds. Mix thoroughly
until smooth.

In a deep skillet, heat the peanut oil to 300° F (the temperature is
important because if the oil is too hot, the fritters will cook too
fast on the outside and not puff up.)

Drop the batter by the tablespoonful into the hot oil, no more than 4
or 5 at a time. When the fritters are browned and puffed, remove them
with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with
confectioners sugar.

Carrageen Pudding With Rhubarb & Rosehip Je

deserts

1  strip lemon peel
1/2 oz prepared dried carrageen *
1 tablespoon sugar
1  egg
2  sticks rhubarb **
4 tablespoon rosehip or redcurrant jelly

*Note: Carrageen is a purple-brown or green fronded seaweed common on
Scottish beaches on the mid-tide line. It can be used to set and
delicately flavour a jelly or thicken a soup. If you gather your own
fresh, you will need about 2 oz to set a pint of milk. Dried
carrageen is available in health-food stores, or Chinese supermarkets
in processed form, as agar-agar. **Rhubarb sticks should be sliced
and lightly poached with additional sugar. Bring the milk to the boil
with the lemon rind. Stir in the carrageen and cook for a couple of
minutes until the milk thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden
spoon. Add sugar. Allow the mixture to cool until it is at blood
temperature (100 F, 40 C). Whisk the egg till frothy and then whisk
in the warm milk until smooth. Pour the mixture through a sieve into
a cold-wetted ring-mould. Then put it in the fridge to set - it will
only take about 1/2 hour. Run hot water over the outside of the mould
and turn out the jelly. Fill the middle of the ring with a ladleful
of rhubarb compote and surround with a little scarlet sauce of
rosehip or redcurrant jelly melted in a little hot water.

1 lb carrots; peeled - cut in 1/2 chunk
1 cup sugar -plus more for sprinkling
2/3 cup fresh orange juice
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoon ground ginger

soft, about 30 minutes. With a potato masher, mash the carrots and
any remaining liquid. Stir in sugar, orange juice and lemon juice.

Let stand until cool enough to handle.

Sprinkle a small cutting board and rolling pin with water. Turn carrot
mixture onto the board and roll into a l/2" thick rectangle. Sprinkle
generously with sugar. Let stand, covered with cheesecloth or a
towel, for one day, until the top feels dry. Cut into 1" wide strips.
Turn and sprinkle the other side of the strips generously with sugar.
Let stand, covered with cheesecloth or a towel, for another day. Turn
the strips daily, until the candy is dry, up to 4 days. After the
strips feel crisp, cut into 1" diameter squares. Sprinkle again with
sugar. (Store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.)

Yield: About 30 candies.

1 pkg mochi flour
1  coconut; grated, place coconut in
1 1/2 cup hot water; pour into bowl of coconut
1/3  box of dark brown sugar
1/4 cup cold water

Squeeze grated coconut in water than strain coconut water in clean
dish towel over another bowl.  Squeeze until all liquid has been
extracted. (Instead of fresh coconut, you may use 1/2 can of grated
coconut and 1
1/2    cups of water.)
Place canned coconut in flour and add water until dough is soft
but not too sticky.  Do the same with fresh coconut. Shape dough in
balls of 1 inch diameter and fry in deep fat until golden brown.
Drain dough balls on paper towel.  Then put them in a large mixing
bowl.
When all have been fried, boil water and brown sugar in a small
sauce pan until it reaches the soft boil stage. This is done by
placing a drop of syrup in a bowl of cold water. If it retains it
shape and is soft, it is ready.  Pour over dough balls.  Mix well so
that all are coated with syrup. Remove from bowl and place them in a
platter to cool. Excellent with coffee or tea.

degrees F. (soft-crack stage) on a candy thermometer. Add the cashew
nuts and continue cooking for about 5 minutes, until the candy
thermometer registers 295 degrees F. (hard crack stage.) You may stir
occasionally, if necessary. Remove from the heat and immediately sift
the baking soda evenly over the surface. (Be careful---the syrup will
foam up.) Add the vanilla and stir to distribute the soda and vanilla
throughout the mixture. Pour at once onto the prepared baking sheets.
Tilt the sheets to spread the brittle about 1/2-inch thick. Allow to
cool until firm. Break the brittle into pieces and store in an
airtight container. Variation: Peanuts or other nuts can be added
instead of the cashews, or you can use a combination of several nuts.
Always choose the raw unsalted nuts that are available in health-food
and speciality stores. The nuts will cook and "toast" when added to
the hot syrup. Makes abouy 2 pounds.

Catalan Nougat (Turron De Agramunt)

candy, holiday, spanish

      ----NORMA WRENN----
1 1/3 cup honey
2  egg whites; stiffly beaten
1/2 lb almonds; blanched; peeled kept war
3 1/2 oz hazelnuts; roasted; peeled
1  kept warm (about 3/4 cup)
1  edible rice paper

Put the honey in a heavy saucepan and place over medium heat. Stir it
with a wooden spoon and when the honey begins to boil, remove the pan
from the heat. Continue stirring until the honey thins to the
consistency of pancake syrup.  Stir in the egg whites and return the
mixture to the heat; continue cooking until it reaches a toffee-like
consistency (hard-ball stage). Stir in the nuts and mix well.

Spread the mixture in a jelly-roll pan lined with edible rice paper.
Cover with a second sheet of rice paper and weight the top. Let it
cool, then cut the nougat into 1-inch squares.

When making nougat, the nuts should be warm.  Cover freshly peeled
nuts with foil to retain the warmth they gained in blanching or
roasting; wrap previously peeled nuts in foil and warm them in a
200-degree F. oven for 15 minutes.

Champagne Truffles

candy

      ----CENTER MIXTURE----
8 oz cream
1 lb bittersweet chocolate
1 oz butter
1 oz cognac
      ----ENROBING----
1 lb bittersweet chocolate
1 lb cocoa

It is important to use an excellent quality chocolate when making
truffles since it is the primary ingredient. Valhrona is my first
choice and Callebaut is my second. BRING THE CREAM TO A BOIL and pour
it over the cut chocolate. Allow to stand 1-to-2 minutes and stir
smooth. Beat in the softened butter and cool to set. Beat with an
electric mixer (using a paddle attachment if available) on medium
speed until light. Beat in Cognac. Pipe out small truffles on
parchment or waxed paper with a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch
plain tube. Refrigerate to set. Melt the chocolate. Sift the cocoa
into a deep pan. Dip the truffles in the melted chocolate and then
deposit them in the cocoa, shaking the pan to cover them. After the
covering sets, shake the truffles in a strainer to remove the excess
cocoa.

Charlottka/Charlotte Russe

candy, deserts

16  ladyfinger cookies -- halved
1  lengthwise
4 large egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup milk
1  2  piece
2 teaspoon gelatin -- softened in
1/4 cup cold water
1/2 cup sour cream -- chilled
1/2 cup heavy cream -- chilled
1  raspberry puree
1  vanilla bean

Trim 12 of the ladyfinger halves, tapering them slightly at one end.
Arrange these halves, side by side, curved sides down, on the bottom
of a 1 quart charlotte mold with the tapered ends meeting in the
center. Stand the remaining ladyfingers, curved side out, side by
side around the inside of the mold; if possible, avoid leaving any
open spaces between them.

Beat the egg yolks briefly in a mixing bowl with a whisk or an
electric or rotary mixer.  Stir beating, gradually add the sugar, and
continue to beat until the mixture is thick and pale yellow and runs
sluggishly off the beater when lifted from the bowl. In a small
saucepan, warm the milk and vanilla bean over moderate heat until
bubbles appear around the edge of the pan.. Remove the bean and
slowly pour the hot milk into the eggs, beating constantly.  Cook
over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens into a
custard heavy enough to coat a spoon. Do not let it boil or it will
curdle.

Off the heat, stir in the softened gelatin.  When it has completely
dissolved, strain the custard through a fine sieve set over a large
bowl. With a whisk or rotary or electric beater, whip together the
sour cream and heavy cream until the mixture forms stiff peaks on the
beater when it is lifted out of the bowl. Fill half a large pot with
ice cubes and cover them with 2 inches of water, set the bowl of
custard into the pot and stir the custard with a metal spoon for at
least 5 minutes, or until it is quite cold and just beginning to
thicken to a syrupy consistency. With a rubber spatula,  gently fold
the whipped cream into the custard. Pour the mixture into the
prepared mold, smooth the top with a spatula, cover with plastic wrap
and refrigerate for 4 or 5 hours.

To unmold the charlotte russe, invert a flat serving plate on top of
the mold and serve the dessert with a bowl of the raspberry puree.

Chayote Relleno

deserts, mexican

3 small chayotes (about 6 ounces each)
1/2 cup almonds
1/2 cup sugar
3  eggs
1 tablespoon brandy
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon milk or cream
1 pinch nutmeg
1 1/2 cup sponge cake or pound cake, crumbled; into fine crumbs,
1  plus 2 tablespoons for topping (see; note)
1/2 cup golden sultana or black raisins
3 tablespoon slivered almonds
1 cup softly whipped cream, barely sweete; ned

This is a use for chayote that I would never have thought of, but it
sounds really good.

I love to shock people with the unexpected, such as serving these
stuffed chayote shells for dessert. In this recipe, chayote's
delicate texture and taste combine with almonds, sugar, brandy, eggs,
cream, raisins and sponge cake to make an elegant pudding-like
filling for the pale-green shells. They are abso- lutely delicious
and something you might have been served in one of the fine old
households of colonial Mexico.

Cut the chayote in half lengthwise and steam for 35 minutes, or until
just tender. Do not overcook--you don't want the shells to collapse
when you scoop them out.

Meanwhile, combine the almonds and sugar in a food processor and grind
until the almonds are fairly fine.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

When the chayote is cooked and cool enough to handle, remove the
seed, and scoop out the pulp, leaving a 1/2-inch-thick shell. Set
aside.

Place the chayote pulp in the processor with the ground almonds; add
eggs and process to a puree. Add the brandy, vanilla and milk or
cream. Blend. Pour mixture into a bowl and stir in nutmeg, cake
crumbs and raisins.

Spoon the pudding mixture into the chayote shells (you will have
about 1 1/2 cups left over) and place them in a greased baking dish.
Sprinkle slivered almonds and reserved cake crumbs over the tops.
Bake stuffed shells for 30 minutes. Pour remaining pudding mixture
into a greased loaf pan and bake for 25 minutes.

Serve warm, topped with whipped cream.

Serves 6 lucky people. (The pudding loaf serves 4.)

Note: I cheat and buy a frozen pound cake to use for this recipe.

2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 can cherry pie filling or 1 lg
1  topping:
2 tablespoon margarine
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup flour

Cream margarine and sugar, and beat until light. Add eggs, one at a
time, beating after each until well blended. Add vanilla, 2 c. flour,
and baking powder. Beat until light and fluffy. Spread dough evenly
on lightly greased 11x17 UTILITY or CAKE PAN--***MUST HAVE SIDES**.
(Note: I also use a small 8" cake pan with this) Spread top with
cherry pie filling. Sprinkle topping made by cutting and blending the
margarine, sugar and flour.
Bake at 350 about 25 mins or until edges are light brown. This is
also good with blueberry pie filling, or black raspberry. *Variation
is to use fresh cherries, drained and dried. Then press cherries
about an inch apart in the dough. ****WARNING---do not use my
mother's variation. She used a cookie sheet. Stuff went over sides
into oven and caused a FIRE. Oven was fine but dessert was not. Was
rushed and dumped in front yard. It burned a spot out of the lawn and
its identity resembled everything from burned bacon to um, dog

Cherry Dessert Wontons

deserts, fruits

48 each premade wonton wrappers (1 package)
30 oz tart cherry pie filling
3 cup vegetable oil

Here is a genuine Fake Chinese Recipe.

Powdered Sugar Or Cinnamon Sugar

To assemble wontons, place approximately 1 1/2 Tsp Cherry Pie Filling
(2 cherries plus sauce) in the center of each wonton wrapper. Mositen
the edges of each wrapper, bring one corner up over the filling to
the opposite corner at an angle so that two overlapping triangles are
formed. Pull the two bottom corners of the folded triangle forward so
that they meet one another and slighly overlap. Moisten one end and
pinch the two ends firmly together.  Repeat.

Pour the oil into a deep fryer and heat to 375 degrees F. Deep fry the
wontons, 8 to 10 at a time for about two minutes or until crisp and
golden. Drain on paper towels.

Fried wontons can be kept warm for about one hour in a 250 degree F.
oven or reheated for 5 minutes in a 450 degree F. oven. Powdered
sugar or cinnamon sugar can be sprinkled on the fried wontons, if
desired.

NOTE:  Cherry dessert wontons can be assembled and frozen. To use,
let thaw for 10 minutes and fry as above.

Cherry Souffle

deserts

3/4 cup cherry pure
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
3  egg whites
1  pinch of salt
1  sugar to taste

Pit and puree enough sour cherries to make 3/4 cup. (My guess is that
something over 1 cup whole cherries will be required.) Preheat the
oven to 375øF.  Oil a 1-quart souffl dish and sprinkle it with
sugar. Heat the cherry pure stir to blend; remove from the heat.
Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry and stir them into the
hot pure until evenly blended. Spoon into the souffle dish and bake
for 20-25 minutes.

Cherry Twists

deserts

12  basic crepes, cooked
20  oz can cherry pie filling
1  egg, slightly beaten
1 tablespoon water
1  confectioner's sugar, sifted

Notes: You may use Apple, Berry or other fruit pie filling in place
of the cherry filling. You may use a healthy dollop of whipped cream
as a topping or in place of the powdered sugar. You should sprinkle a
dusting of cinnamon over the whipped cream. You may also use a wedge
shaped portion of flour tortilla in place of the basic crepes.

Preheat the deep fryer. Mix the beaten egg and water together. Place
1 T of fruit filling on the lower 1/3 of each crepe. Brush the top
and bottom edges of the crepes with the egg and water mixture. Fold
the left and right sides of the crepe over the filling. Roll the
crepe up. Place each crepe in the deep fryer, seam side down. Fry
until crisp and golden (about 1 minute). Drain, and sprinkle with
confectioners' sugar. Spoon a little extra filling over the top.

Cheryl's Blueberry Lemon Crisp

deserts

6 1/2 cup blueberries
1 1/2  to 4 teaspoons grated fresh
1  lemon peel, depending on how
1  tart you like it
1  a few pinches flour
1  topping:
1 1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, softened

Put the blueberries in a large but shallow baking dish. You can vary
the amount of blueberries by half a cup either way without making any
difference; 6 1/2 cups is what I happened to have on hand.

Lightly sprinkle a few pinches of flour over the blueberries to help
absorb the berry juice.  You can omit the flour if you want; if you
do, there will be more leftover berry juice in the bottom of the pan.

Sprinkle the lemon peel over the berries.  The tartness of fresh
lemon peel balances the sweetness of the berries and topping, so use
the amount that suits your personal taste. Then go change the name of
the recipe and put your own name in; you've customized it, you
deserve it! :)  Reduce the amount of lemon peel if you decide to cut
back on the amount of topping.

Mix together the remaining ingredients; it will be easier if the
butter and brown sugar are nice and soft. Sprinkle the mix on the
berries. Bake for 25 minutes at 275-degrees F.

1/2 deciliter grappa
3  egg yolks
4  egg whites, stiffly beaten
1  sugar and butter for the - souffle; dish

Soak the chestnuts for 12 hours in cold water and drain (dried
chestnuts are used because they have a stronger flavour than fresh
ones). Cook with the milk for 20 minutes on a very low heat and then
make a puree. Mix together with the softened butter, sugar, vanilla
sugar and the grappa (brandy, if you don't have grappa). Add the egg
yolks one by one, mixing well. Leave to cool then fold in the beaten
egg whites. Put the mixture into a buttered and sugared souffle dish
and bake at 180-190 oC for about 40 minutes. Dust with icing sugar
and serve immediately, with a little whipped cream, if desired.

Chestnuts In Cointreau Syrup

deserts, fruits, grains, sauces

1 1/2 lb chestnuts (about 50 nuts)
2 large fresh tangerines; peel of - pith removed -
3/4 cup sugar
1 1/4 cup ; water
1/3 cup light corn syrup
1 tablespoon orange zest; finely slivered
1/3 cup cointreau or
1  other orange-flavor liqueur*

*Grand Marnier, Triple Sec, etc.

Chop each chestnut in half with a cleaver or heavy knife (lay them
flat side down on a cutting board for easy chopping.) Place the nuts
in a saucepan, add water to cover by 1", and bring them to a boil
over high heat.  Boil the nuts, uncovered, 3 minutes, then drain
them. Pry or pop the halves out of the shells. The skin will usually
remain in the shell; scrape off any bits that adhere to the nuts.
Halve each piece.

Return nuts to the rinsed-out saucepan; add the skin of one tangerine
and enough cold water to cover the nuts. Bring the liquid to a boil,
lower heat, and simmer the nuts gently, partly covered, until they are
translucent, about 1 hour.  If necessary, add more boiling water to
keep the nuts covered.  Using a slotted spoon, lift the nuts from the
cooking liquid, leaving any scum behind. Discard the liquid and peel.

Combine the sugar, water and remaining tangerine peel in the
rinsed-out saucepan; bring the mixture to a boil. Simmer the syrup 10
minutes, then add the chestnuts. Bring the syrup to a boil again,
then lower heat and simmer the chestnuts, covered, for 15 minutes.
Remove the pieces of zest; return the sauce to boiling and simmer it
for 3 minutes.

Ladle the nuts and syrup into a sterilized storage jar and add orange
liqueur. Cover the jar, shaking it to mix everything, then cool and
refrigerate.  The flavor improves for several weeks. Stores for up to
a year in the refrigerator.

The author suggests spooning this sauce into stemmed glasses and
topping it with lightly whipped cream, or serving it as an ice cream
topping.

Yield: About 2 1/2 cups.

Choc. Hazelnut Mascarpone Torte W/Raspberries I

deserts, holiday, low fat, summer

2 can cake flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2  unsalted butter; softened
1 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup light brown sugar; packed
2 large eggs; room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cup strongly brewed coffee; room
      ----CARAMELIZED HAZELNUTS & PRAL---
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup water
12  hazelnuts <see note below> -
3/4 cup hazelnuts; toasted

Recipe by: <lhroberts@aol.com> NOTE: Position a rack in the center of
the oven and preheat to 350F. Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet
and toast for 12-15 minutes, or until golden beneath the skins. Wrap
the nuts in a clean towel and cool completely. Transfer the cooled
hazelnuts to a large sieve and rub them back and forth to remove the
loose skins.

Make the chocolate butter cake: Position a rack in the center of the
oven and preheat to 375F. Line the bottom of a 17 1/2x11 1/2 jelly
roll pan with parchment or wax paper. Lightly spray the bottom and
sides of the pan with nonstick cooking spray. In a medium bowl, whisk
together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Sift the
flour mixture onto a piece of wax paper and set aside. In a 4 1/2 qt.
bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using a paddle attachment, beat
the butter at medium-high speed for 1 minute, until creamy. While
continuing to beat the butter, gradually add the granulated and brown
sugars, stopping the machine and scraping down the side of the bowl
as necessary. Beat the butter/sugar mixture at medium-high speed for
2 minutes, until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and the
vanilla. Reduce the speed to low, and alternately add 1/3 of the
reserved dry ingred. and 1/3 of the coffee. In 2 more batches,
alternately add the remaining dry ingred. and coffee, scraping down
the bowl as necessary. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and,
using a metal cake spatula, smooth the batter evenly into the pan.
Bake the cake for 25-28 min., until the sides just begin to pull away
from the pan and the surface springs back when lightly touched. Cool
the cake in the pan set on a wire rack for 10 min. Invert the cake
onto a wire rack; carefully peel off the parchment paper and allow
the cake to cool completely.

Make the caramelized hazelnuts and praline: Lightly spray a baking
sheet with nonstick cooking spray. In a small saucepan, combine the
sugar and water. Cook over med. heat, stirring constantly, until the
sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue to
cook without stirring for 4-6 min., until the syrup caramelizes.
Immediately remove the pan from the heat. Add the 12 perfect
hazelnuts to the caramel and toss to coat. With an oiled fork, remove
each hazelnut, letting the excess caramel drip back into the pan, and
place them at one end of the prepared baking sheet. Quickly stir the
3/4 c. of hazelnuts into the remaining hot caramel. Pour the hazelnut
praline onto the other end of the baking sheet. Cool the praline for
30 min. until hard. Reserve the individual caramelized hazelnuts for
decorating the cake. Coarsely chop the praline. In a food processor
fitted with the metal chopping blade, process the praline for 35-45
seconds until finely ground. Transfer the praline to a bowl and set
aside.

Choc. Hazelnut Mascarpone Torte W/Raspberries Ii

freezer, frozen

      ----FRAMBOISE SYRUP----
1 1/4 cup water
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon framboise liqueur
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
      ----MASCARPONE FILLING----
2 cup mascarpone cheese
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup framboise liqueur
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
      ----CHOCOLATE GLAZE----
8 oz bittersweet chocolate; finel
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
5 cup fresh raspberries

SEE Chocolate Hazelnut Mascarpone Torte w/Raspberries I first

Make the framboise syrup: In a small saucepan, combine the water and
sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon
until the sugar dissolves. Stop stirring; raise the heat to
medium-high and bring the syrup to a boil. Remove the pan from the
heat and stir in the framboise liqueur and vanilla.

Make the mascarpone cream filling: In a 4 1/2 qt. bowl of a heavy-duty
electric mixer using the wire whip attachment, beat together the
mascarpone cheese, sugar and framboise liqueur at medium speed until
combined, about 1 minute. While continuing to beat the mixture,
gradually add the heavy cream; increase the speed to medium-high and
beat the mascarpone mixture until soft peaks form and the mixture is
spreadable. Cover and refrigerate the cream until ready to use.

Assemble the cake: Using a long serrated knife, cut the cake
lengthwise into 3 long strips of equal width. Place 1 cake strip on a
wire rack. Using a pastry brush, moisten the top of the chocolate
cake strip with some of the framboise syrup. Using an offset metal
cake spatula, spread 1/4 cup of the mascarpone cream over the
moistened cake strip. Cover the cream-coated strip with a layer of
raspberries, places stem-side down in even rows over the cake (this
will take approx. 2 1/3 cups of raspberries). Scrape 1 1/2 cups of
the mascarpone cream on top of the raspberries. Using a small offset
metal spatula, smooth the cream into an even layer, allowing it to
settle into the gaps in between the berries. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the
ground praline over the cream layer. Place a 2nd cake strip on top of
the praline; repeat the layering process and top with the final cake
strip. Reserve the remaining ground praline to garnish the sides of
the cake. Spread the remaining mascarpone cream in a thin, even layer
around the sides of the cake, filling in all the gaps. Place the wire
rack with the cake on it in the refrigerator for 1 hour to set.

Make the glaze: Place the chocolate in a med. bowl. In a small
saucepan, bring the cream and corn syrup to a gentle boil. Pour the
hot cream mixture over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30
seconds to melt the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Allow the
glaze to cool for 5 minutes.

Glaze the cake: Remove the cake from the refrigerator and place the
wire rack on a baking sheet. Pour the glaze over the cake, covering it
completely. While the glaze is still wet, put the remaining ground
praline around the sides of the cake. Refrigerate the cake for 5-10
minutes, until the glaze is set. Garnish the top of the cake with the
caramelized hazelnuts.

Christmas Candy Canes

candy, holiday

3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon peppermint flavoring
1/2 cup water
3/4 cup lt. corn syrup
3/4 teaspoon red vegetable coloring
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar

Any self-respecting Christmas tree has a right to complain If it isn't
decked out with a candy cane. The sugar, water, syrup, and cream of
tartar you combine and heat till the sugar's dissolved real fine.
Divide into two saucepans, boil, but don't stir, please, Until each
lot 280 degrees. Add 1/2 ts peppermint to each lot and add the
coloring to one, the other not: place on an enamel or marble table to
cool. (First oiling the table, as a general rule). Like taffy you
stretch and pull and form into ropes of red and white, now twist them
around again and again.
And form them into your candy cane.
Now on an oiled surface you allow them to harden, then announce to
your family that these is ready for your Christmas tree. FROM:

Christmas Tiramisu

deserts

1 lb mascarpone or soft cream
1  cheese
3/4 cup sugar
8 large egg yolks
1/2 cup sweet wine
2 cup expresso or very strong
1  black coffee (approx)
9 oz ladyfingers or 14 oz. angel
1  food or sponge cake, thinly
1  sliced
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa

1. In a small bowl, using a fork, beat the cheese until creamy. Set
aside.

2. Place a large (about 10-12 cups capacity) metal bowl over a pot of
boiling water. Using a hand-held electric mixer set on medium high,
beat the sugar and egg yolks in the bowl for 1 minute, or until the
mixture is well blended. With the mixer set on low speed to prevent
splashing, gradually add the wine. Continue to cook and beat the
mixture, increasing the speed to medium and then to high as the
mixture thickens. Cook and beat for 5-7 minutes, or until the mixture
is thickened and light, scraping down the sides of the bowl
frequently with a rubber spatula.

3. Remove the bowl from the heat and continue to beat the mixture for
1 minute longer. Beat in the cheese just until blended (makes about 5
cups).

4. Pour one cup of the expresso into a small shallow bowl that is
large enough to hold a ladyfinger if it is placed horizontally in the
bowl.

5. Quickly dip the rounded top side of each ladyfinger into the
expresso. Only the top half of the ladyfingers should be soaked with
the expresso. If the ladyfingers get too wet, they will fall apart!
Add more coffee to the bowl as needed.

6. Place the ladyfingers, flat side down, in the bottom of a 13 x 9
glass or ceramic pan. Do not use a metal pan. Form one layer. Pour
half of the custard mixture over the ladyfingers and spread to cover
them. Dip the remaining ladyfingers in the expresso (there will be a
few remaining ones and form a second layer over the custard mixture.
Pour the remaining custard mixture over the ladyfingers and spread to
an even layer.

7. Place the cocoa in a strainer and dust the top of the tiramisu
evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 10 hours.

Makes: 10-12 servings.

completely rolled. Slice rolled dough into 1/2" slices (or larger if
a larger bun is preferred ).Place into greased cake pans. ( I use 3 -
9" pans ) I usually get 19 - 20 buns from this. Let rise until
doubled. Bake at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes, until golden. Do not
overbake. FROST with: 4 oz cream cheese (softened) 1/4 C butter
(softened) 1 1/2 C confectioners sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla 1 1/2 tsp milk

SPREAD on very warm rolls.  They are best when eaten fresh, but we
have found that 10 - 15 seconds in the microwave rejuvenates them!

Note:  I made these in my Hitachi B101 and the dough turned out
beautifully!  I added chopped nuts to the filling though and doubled
the cinnamon.  I also sliced my rolls about 1" and placed them in a
non-stick 13x9" baking pan which rendered about 10 large rolls. Also,
because I don't care for a cream cheese frosting, I used 3 cups
powdered sugar, 4 Tbsp. softened butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and about 3
Tbsp. milk which made lots of frosting, perhaps too much. (Debbie

Cinnamon Torte

deserts, vegatarian, vegetarian

4 oz self-raising flour
1 teaspoon powdered cinnamon
4 oz ground almonds
4 oz caster sugar
4 oz butter or margarine
1  lemon; (grated rind only)
8 oz raspberry jam
1  icing sugar

Sift the flour and cinnamon into a bowl or food processor, then put
in the ground almonds, sugar, butter or margarine and grated lemon
rind. Process, without the plunger (to let in more air and make the
mixture light), or rub the fat into the other ingredients with your
fingers. Either way, the result will be a soft dough. You can roll
this out straight away, but it's easier to handle if you wrap it in
polythene and chill it for 30 minutes.

Set the oven to 180 C/350 F/Gas Mark 4.  On a lightly floured board,
roll out two-thirds of the almond mixture, to fit a 20 cm/8 inch flan
tin. Put the pastry into the tin and trim the edges. Spread the jam
over the pastry, then roll out the remaining pastry, including the
trimmings, and cut long strips to make a lattice across the top of
the jam. Bake the torte for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is set
and lightly browned. Serve hot or cold, with a snowy topping of
sifted icing sugar.

Cinnamon-Apple Lollipops

candy

1 teaspoon vegetable oil
10 large cinnamon sticks, 2 to
1  2 1/2 long
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1 teaspoon cinnamon oil
2 tablespoon apple-juice concentrate

Brush vegetable oil evenly over a baking sheet.  With a large chef's
knife, cut each cinnamon stick in half lengthwise along the groove
between the two curled edges. Arrange the cinnamon sticks on the
prepared baking sheet and set aside.  In a heavy medium saucepan,
combine sugar, corn syrup, cinnamon oil and 1/2 c water; bring to a
boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
Clip a candy thermometer to the pan and boil until the temperature
reaches 300 degrees and is at hard-crack stage (when a bit of syrup
dropped into ice water is hard and brittle and does not stick to
teeth).  This will take about ten minutes. Remove from the heat and
stir in apple-juice concentrate.  Return saucepan to high heat and
cook, stirring, until thoroughly combined. Continue cooking, swirling
the pan just until the mixture begins to color, 1 to 3 minutes.
Immediately remove from heat and let stand until the bubbles subside,
about 2 minutes. Spoon about 1/2 T of the hot sugar mixture over the
tip of each cinnamon stick and let stand until hardened, about 5
minutes.  (If the sugar mixture hardens before all lollipops are
formed, return the pan to high heat just until the syrup begins to
bubble; be careful not to let it burn. Let stand for 1 to 2 minutes,
then continue.) When lollipops have set, carefully loosen them from
the baking sheet. (The lollipops can be stored in an airtight
container, with was paper between each layer, in a cool, dry place
for up to 1 week.)  28 calories per lollipop: 0 g protein, 1 g fat, 6

orange and grapefruit.

To add a variety of flavors and textures to the salad, toss in any
desired amount of any or all of the following: thin slices of water
chestnut, julienne strips of purple onion, little bits of candied
ginger, and toasted walnuts.

For the dressing, mix all of the ingredients together in a

Cocada Imperial (Imperial Coconut Flan)

deserts, mexican

2 cup milk
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1  small coconut
5  small eggs, separated
1  pinch   salt
1  flan mold coated with
1  caramel

Preheat the oven to 450F.

Place the sugar and milk in a heavy saucepan and melt the sugar
over low heat, then raise the heat and boil the mixture briskly. Take
care that it does not boil over. As soon as the mixture begins to
thicken, stir it so that it does not stick to the bottom of the pan.
After about 30 minutes it should be the consistency of thin condensed
milk and has been reduced to 1 cup.  See Note.

Pierce holes through two of the "eyes" of the coconut and drain
the water from it.  Set the water aside.

Put the whole coconut into the oven for about 8 minutes. Crack it
open; the flesh should come away quite easily from the shell.

Pare the brown skin from the coconut flesh with a potato peeler.
Grate the coconut finely.  You will need 2 1/4 cups, loosely packed,
for the flan.

Add the grated coconut to the reserved coconut water and boil it
for about 5 minutes, stirring it constantly.

Add the "condensed" milk and continue cooking for another 5
minutes. Set the mixture aside to cool.

Beat the egg yolks together until they are creamy and stir them
well into the coconut mixture.

Beat the egg whites until they are frothy, add the salt and
continue beating until they are stiff. Fold them into the mixture.

Pour the mixture into the prepared mold.  Cover the mold with a
well-greased lid and place into a water bath.

Cook the flan on the lowest shelf of the oven for about 1 1/2
hours, then test to see if it is done. When it is done, set it aside
to cool.

Makes 6 servings.

NOTES:
Of course, you can substitute1 cup of lightly thinned canned,
sweetened condensed milk for the milk and sugar and substitute
pre-grated but unsweetened coconut. Use milk instead of coconut
water; the flavor will just not be quite as good.

Do not think you have done something wrong when you see that the
coconut and custard have separated. That is how it is meant to be. The
caramel will nearly all have been absorbed by the spongy layer of
coconut.

If you are using fresh coconut there will almost certainly be
some left over.  It will keep perfectly well if frozen.

To test to see if the flan is cooked through, insert the blade
of a knife or a skewer well into the flan. The knife should come out
clean. Take care not to pierce the flan at the bottom or it will
spoil the appearance of the top when it is unmolded.

Cocoa Almond Biscotti Lf

deserts

1 2/3 cup flour
2/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup chopped almonds (optional)
1/4 cup fat-free egg substitute plus
2 tablespoon fat-free egg substitute
1  (can use egg whites)
1/4 cup chocolate syrup
2 teaspoon almond extract

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa and baking powder
and stir to mix well. Add the almonds if desired and stir to mix. Add
the remaining ingredients and stir just until the dough holds
together.

2. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape into two 8
x 2 inch logs. (If the dough is too sticky to handle, knead in a
little more flour.) Flatten out the logs a little bit or else the
crust will split and crack. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking
spray and place the logs on the sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for
about 23 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer the logs to a
wire rack and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

3. Place the logs on a cutting board and use a serrated knife to
slice the logs diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place the
slices on a baking sheet and bake at 300 degrees F for 20 minutes or
until lightly browned, turning after 10 minutes.

4. Transfer the biscotti to wire racks and cool completely. Serve
immediately or store in an airtight container.

NOTE: These are very easy to make and taste great. I made them
without the almonds, so there were even less fat and calories.

Coco-Chips

deserts

1/4 lb margarine (one stick)
1 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
1 cup coconut, shredded
1 1/4 cup chocolate chips
1 3/4 cup condensed milk, sweetened (1 can)

Melt the margarine in a 9x13-inch pan.  Combine with graham cracker
crumbs and spread evenly on bottom of pan. Sprinkle coconut evenly
over crumbs. Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over coconut. Pour
condensed milk evenly over everything. Bake for 30 minutes at
350    degrees F.

Let cool for a bit.  Cut into squares and enjoy.  Mom insists on using
"Borden Eagle Brand" sweetened condensed milk. Don't ask me why.

NOTES:

*  A nicely fattening combination of coconut and chocolate chips --
This comes from Mom. (She doesn't know where she got it; she
memorized it years ago and lost the original recipe.) It's always
been a favorite with us kids, and last time I was home she gave me
the recipe. It's so simple that even a complete clutz like myself was
able to make it perfectly the first time.

In a bowl, combine first five ingredients:  press lightly into
greased 13x9 pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes, stirring

half, pressing half back into the same baking dish to form crust. In
a mixing bowl, beat puddings and milk. Fold in whipped topping and
spoon over crust. Top with remaining crumb mixture. Cover and

1  coconut milk
1 cup sugar

Contributed to the echo by: Stephen Ceideburg Originally from:
"Discover Thai Cooking" by Chaslin, Canungmai and Tettoni, Times
Editions, Singapore. 1987 Here's a simple Thai recipe for coconut
custard. Coconut Custard (Sang Khaya) milk) Beat the eggs with the
coconut cream and sugar until the mixture is frothy.

Pour the liquid into small molds or ramekins. Place in a steamer over
boiling water, cover and cook for about 20 minutes or until the
mixture has set.

Coconut Flan With Caramel (Banh Dua Ca Ra Men

deserts, vietnamese

      ----CARAMEL----
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup hot water
      ----CUSTARD----
1 cup fresh or canned coconut milk
1 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
4  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

This is the ultimate coconut dessert++an adaptation of the classic
"Creme renversee", or "Flan au caramel". The technique used is
distinctly French but the flavors are all Vietnamese.

This custard is at its best when prepared a day in advance and
refrigerated so the flavors can mellow. If you just can't wait, you
might try the Vietnamese method of rapid cooling for dishes such as
this: place a small scoop of shaved ice on top of each custard before
serving!

Preheat the oven to 325F.

Make the caramel:  Cook the sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low
heat, swirling the pan constantly, until brown. Stir the hot water
into the caramel, being careful to guard against splattering (the
mixture will bubble vigorously).  Boil the mixture, swirling the pan
occasionally, until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, about 2
minutes.

Pour the caramel syrup into a 1-quart souffle dish or five 4-ounce
ramekins.  Tilt the molds to coat all of the surfaces with caramel.

Make the custard:  Combine the coconut milk, milk and sugar in a
medium saucepan over low heat.  Scald until the sugar dissolves
completely. Remove from heat.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla. Gradually whisk the hot
coconut milk mixture into the eggs, blending thoroughly.

Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a bowl. Carefully pour
into the caramel-lined souffle dish or ramekins.

Line a large roasting pan with 2 layers of paper towels (see Note).
Put the souffle dish in the roasting pan and add hot water to reach
halfway up the side of the dish.  Bake in the center of the oven for
50 minutes (30 minutes if using ramekins), or until a knife inserted
in the center comes out clean.  Be careful not to let the water boil;
do not disturb the custard while baking.  This is the only "secret"
to producing a smooth and velvety custard.

Remove the souffle dish immediately from the hot water. Allow to cool
in a cold-water bath.  Chill thoroughly.

To serve, run a knife around the edge of the custard and turn out onto
dessert plates.  Serve with shaved ice or whipped cream, if desired.

Note:  The paper towels in the roasting pan serve a twofold purpose:
First, they allow the hot water to circulate under the souffle dish
while baking to distribute the heat evenly; second, if using small
ramekins, it stabilizes them and keeps them from moving around while
baking.

Yield: 5 servings.

Coeurs A La Creme

deserts

8 oz unsalted cream cheese
10 oz soured cream
2 tablespoon caster sugar
2 large egg whites
      ----TO SERVE----
1  fruit of your choice, such as raspb; erries and redcurrants
4 tablespoon double cream

Quite simply combine the cream cheese, soured cream and sugar
thoroughly in a mixing bowl. Then whisk the egg whites until they are
stiff and fold them carefully into the cream mixture. The whole lot
now needs to be drained - overnight - in a cool place, and this is
done by placing the mixture in a suitably-sized square of muslin, and
placing this in a sieve over a bowl. When it has drained completely,
pile the mixture into small dishes or ramekins, arrange your fruit on
top, then pour a tablespoon of cream over each serving.

Coeurs A La Creme With Fresh Raspberry Coulis

deserts

8 oz curd or cottage cheese or- cream ch; eese
10 fl oz double (heavy) cream
2 tablespoon caster (superfine) sugar
2  egg whites
5 fl oz single (light) cream
8 oz raspberries
      ----RASPBERRY COULIS----
10 oz fresh raspberries
1/2 cup caster (superfine) sugar
2 tablespoon lemon juice

Traditionally the heart-shaped moulds were made of wicker; now china
ones are used.  If you decide to use cream cheese, make sure it is
unsalted.

Press the cheese through a fine sieve into a mixing bowl and stir in
first the double cream then the sugar. Beat until light and fluffy.
In a small bowl, beat the egg whites just until stiff. Fold them
carefully into the cheese mixture.

Line six moulds with fine damp muslin or cheesecloth. Spoon the
cheese into the prepared moulds, tapping the sides gently to allow
the mixture to settle.  Fold the ends of the cloth over the moulds,
place them on a cake rack and refrigerate overnight.

To make coulis, liquidize the raspberries and sugar to a smooth
puree. Add lemon juice to taste.  Pass through a sieve into a small
bowl. To serve, spoon a little of the raspberry coulis on to each
serving plate. Discard any draining liquid and unmould the
heart-shaped desserts on top of the sauce.  Drizzle with cream and
surround with the raspberries.

Cold Lemon Souffle (M_C-Tx)

deserts, snacks

5  eggs separated
1 1/4 cup sugar
2 cup whipping cream
3 large lemons (2/3 c. juice)
2  envelopes unflavored gelatin
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 cup fresh berries (optional)

Beat together egg yolks and sugar.  Grate rinds of lemons (I don't use
this) and squeeze out juice, measuring out 2/3 cups lemon juice. Add
rind to the egg yolks, then gradually add the 2/3 cups lemon juice,
beating all the while.  (This "cooks" the egg yolk.) Soften the
gelatin in 1/2 cup of hot water and beat until it is dissolved. Allow
to cool slightly. Whip the cream lightly and stir into lemon mixture;
then stir in gelatin and continue stirring until mixture begins to
thicken. Beat egg whites with cream of tartar until stiff but not
dry; fold into lemon mixture. Spoon souffle into dish and chill in
refrigerator until completely set (about two hours). Serve with
berries if desired. 12 servings.

ingredients necessary for variations.

Stir a little of the pudding into beaten egg, then return to pudding.
(If you heat the egg too quickly, it'll cook a little. It's
unsightly, but it'll still taste pretty good.)

Add butter and vanilla, mix well, and chill in fridge. This is

foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until the filling is
bubbly and the topping is golden brown. Serve warm.

NOTES: I doubled the amount of topping at the request of my family
(it is that good!) Also, you can put just about anything into this. I
added jars of baby food fruits once when I didn't have cranberries
and raisins and it was wonderful.

puddings

10  slices of day-old bread
1 1/2 lb fruit
5 fl oz water
1  sugar to taste
7 oz jar cranberry sauce

Cut the crusts off the bread. Prepare and cook the fruit with the
water and sugar to taste. Add the cranberry sauce just before the end
of the cooking period, blend well. Strain the fruit, reserve 5 fl
oz/150 ml ofthe juice. Place a layer of fruit at the bottom of the
basin, add a layer ofbread, then more fiuit with a little juice. Fill
the basin like this, ending with the bread. Place a small saucer and
heavy weight over the top of the pudding and stand for at least 12
hours. Turn out and serve with any fruit juice left and cream or
ice-creaxn or custard.

Variation

The pudding can be made in the more usual way by lining the basin with
bread, filling the cavity with the fruit and a little juice then
covering the filling with more bread. Add the weight and allow to
stand, as left.

Cranberry Fritters

deserts, vegatarian, vegetarian

8 oz cranberry jelly, canned
5 tablespoon flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon sugar
5 tablespoon water
1  vegetable oil - for deep-frying
1  flour; for dredging

Cranberry tartness suggests the original Chinese ingredient, a firm,
gelatinous jelly flavored with the hawthorn berry (or 'shan dza',
which in northern China is pureed to make a delicious tart, thick,
cooling drink). Enclosed within a light, deep-fried batter, the
strips of jelly become hot and soft or, in the case of cranberry,
almost liquid. Buy the "jellied cranberry sauce", not the whole-berry
type.

This recipe makes three to four small servings.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Cut the jelly crosswise into three round
slices, 1/2 inch thick. Cut each slice into three strips,
approximately 1/2 x 1/2 x 2-1/2 inches.

Prepare a batter by blending the flour, baking powder, sugar, and
water.

Heat oil for deep-frying; after it is hot, keep the heat around
medium-high.  Dredge the cranberry jelly strips lightly in flour,
making sure all sides, including the ends, are dusted. Then dip them
in the batter to coat completely, and immerse them in the oil until
golden brown. Fry only a few at a time.  Drain on paper toweling, and
eat while hot.

Cranberry Fritters From Loren Martin

deserts, ethnic, fruits

1 cup fresh cranberries, washed &
1  drained well
3 cup flour
1 1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk, plus 2 tb
3 cup shortening or oil for deep-
1  frying

Place the cranberries on paper toweling and dry well. Sift together
the dry ingredients and mix in the milk, a little at a time, to make
a stiff dough. Flour your hands well, pinch off a small piece of
dough (about 1 teaspoon), place a cranberry in the center, and roll
into a ball with the cranberry inside.  The balls should be about the
size of large marbles. Place the shortening or oil in a deep, heavy
kettle, and heat till it registers 375F on a deep-fat-frying
thermometer. Drop the fritters into the hot fat and fry, turning,
until deep golden brown on all sides. Drain on paper toweling.  This
really works best as a two-person operation, with one shaping the
fritters and the other frying them.

Cranberry Hazelnut Bread

breads, deserts, holiday

1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup dried cranberries, dried pitted che; rries, or
1  snipped dates
1/2 cup dried blueberries or raisins
1/3 cup chopped hazelnuts or pecans
2  eggs
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup orange juice
1/3 cup cooking oil
1  brandy

Grease bottom and sides of four 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 x 1 1/2-inch loaf pans.
(Greasing the sides only partway up will result in nicely rounded
tops and prevent unwanted rims along the edges.) Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, stir together flour, cinnamon, baking powder,
baking soda, and cloves. Add cranberries or cherries, blueberries or
raisins, and hazelnuts or pecans.

In a medium mixing bowl, beat eggs; stir in brown sugar, orange
juice, and cooking oil.  Stir into fruit mixture. Spoon about 3/4 cup
of the batter into each pan, stirring batter often.

Bake loaves in a 300 degree F oven about 40 minutes or till a
toothpick inserted near the center of each loaf comes out clean. Cool
the loaves in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove loaves
from pans. Cool thoroughly on wire racks.

Wrap loaves in brandy-moistened cheesecloth. Over-wrap with foil. To
mellow flavors, store in the refrigerator for up to 8 weeks.
Remoisten cheesecloth with about 1 Tablespoon of brandy once a week
or as needed. Makes 4 loaves, 8 servings each.

Cranberry-Apple Strudle

deserts, fruits

6  granny smith apples
6 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 pinch allspice
1 pinch nutmeg
3/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries
1 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved in 2
1  tb cold water
5  sheets (14-by-18-inch)
1  phyllo dough

Peel, core and quarter the apples. Cut each quarter in half and then
each wedge into three pieces (you will have apple chunks).

In a heavy-bottomed 12-inch frying pan, melt 3 tablespoons of the
butter over medium-high heat. Add the sugar and cook, stirring, until
the butter and sugar melt together, turn light brown and have the
consistency of peanut butter. Add the apples car efully (the sugar
mixture is very hot). With a wooden spoon, mix the apples carefully
with the caramel. The caramel will harden; don't worry, it will melt
again. Mix together the cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg and sprinkle
evenly over the apples. Cook the apple mixture, stirring often, until
the caramel melts and the apples soften and start to look cooked.

Stir in the cranberries and the cornstarch mixture. Cook for 2 to 3
minutes, until the juices in the pan thicken and take on a glossy
appearance. Transfer the apple-cranberry mixture to a shallow dish
and let cool.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet that has a
raised rim all around with parchment paper.

Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Lay a sheet of phyllo on
the prepared baking sheet. Brush the phyllo sheet lightly with the
melted butter. Place the next sheet of phyllo on top and brush it
with butter. Repeat with the remaining sheets, but do not butter the
top sheet. Reserve a bit of melted butter to brush on top of the
finished strudel. Place the apple-cranberry mixture in a strip along
the long side of the phyllo, about 1 inch in from the edge. Using the
parchment to help keep th ings together, roll up the phyllo to form a
long log. Adjust the roll's position on the baking sheet so it is not
touching the sides of the sheet. The roll will leak while it cooks,
so make sure it is on the parchment paper. Brush the top of the roll
with the reserved melted butter. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to
30 minutes, until the roll is nicely browned. Let it sit at least 15
minutes before serving.

Cranberry-Orange Shrub

deserts, fruits

1 x no ingredients

1 c  water -- plus
2 TB cold water
2 c  cranberries
1/2    envelope unflavored gelatin
1/4 c  honey
1 c  fresh orange juice
:          MUCH LATER:
2 c  skim milk
1    egg white -- at room
:          temperature

"This rich pink dessert is similar to sorbet but lighter in texture."
(Untried)

In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup of water to a boil, add the
cranberries, and reduce the heat. Simmer the fruit until it is soft,
about 10 minutes. Put the cranberries through a food mill to remove
the skins, or press through a sieve; keep warm.

Meanwhile, put the remaining 2 tablespoons of cold water in a large
bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over it, and let the gelatin soften for 3
to 5 minutes. Stir in the hot cranberries and the honey and mix well
to melt the gelatin and distribute it evenly throughout the fruit.

Let cool to room temperature and stir in the orange juice. Cover the
bowl and refrigerate until well chilled. (From 4 to 8 hours)

Beat in the milk, pour the mixture into a shallow metal dish, and
freeze it until solid. Break it into chunks, transfer them to the
bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, and process
until smooth. Alternatively, puree the mixture with a hand-held mixer.

Beat the egg white until it is stiff, fold it into the slush, and
return the mixture to the freezing pan. Freeze the dessert for at
least 30 minutes more. If it has frozen solid, transfer it to the
refrigerator to soften for about 15 minutes. Serve in chilled
goblets. Serves 4 at 170 cals each.

Crema Quemada A La Catalana

deserts, spain

6  egg yolks, beaten
2 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/4 cup confectioners sugar
2 cup milk
1  cinnamon stick
1  zest of 1 lemon
2 tablespoon brown sugar

Put the egg yolks in a bowl with the cornstarch and confectioners
sugar. Simmer the milk with the cinnamon stick and lemon zest, then
add the egg mixture and cook slowly, stirring to avoid lumps until
the custard thickens ~ do not boil it.

This may be done in a double boiler or in a saucepan placed in a
larger pan of simmering water. Remove the cinnamon stick and lemon
zest, divide the custard between 6 3-inch ramekins and leave in the
refrigerator overnight.

Before serving, sprinkle the top with brown sugar and leave for a few
seconds under a hot broiler, then cool. Do this about 30 minutes
beforehand so that the caramel remains crisp.

In Spain, the sugar is caramelized with a salamandra heated on a
brazier or gas flame. It is obtainable also in specialized shops in
the UK and the USA

froth has subsided.

3. Remove mixture from heat and whisk in cognac. Strain through a fine
sieve and cool. Refrigerate in a covered container until ready to
use, up to 2 days.

Creme Caramel

deserts

4 cup 2% milk
2  rosemary sprigs
1  orange; zested in strips
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 cup liquid egg substitute
4 tablespoon sugar; super fine hot water
4 teaspoon maple syrup; pure
      ----GARNISH----
4  rosemary sprigs

"Creme caramel is a great favorite in many restaurants. It is
basically a super rich baked egg custard made with added heavy cream.
It looks small and innocent, but packs a devastating amount of
"shadow energy" (many calories with few nutrients). Our substitutions
are indeed radical ...but they are delicious and reduce the fat
significantly.

Preheat the oven to 300F. In a large saucepan, heat the milk,
rosemary and orange peel until just about to boil. Strain into a
large bowl and stir in the vanilla, egg substitute and sugar. Pour
the custard into 4 individual souffle dishes. Place a 9 inch X 9 inch
baking dish on the oven rack. Place the filled souffle in the dish
and pour in the hot water - the souffle dishes should be about three
quarters submerged. Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake
for 1 hour - the custard should be well set. Take the souffle dishes
out of the water and let them cool a bit -a bout 1 hour. To serve:
Loosen the custard from the souffle dish with a knife. Invert the
dish over an individual serving plate and shake the custard out.
Spoon 1 Tsp of the maple syrup over the top. Garnish with a sprig of
rosemary..voila! You can serve Creme Caramel at room temperature or
cold. Serves: 4

5  whole cloves
20 oz frozen sliced peaches  (unsweetened; )

thickened, about 6 to 7 minutes. Strain the liquid into a large
skillet, transferring the cinnamon stick to the pan. Add the frozen
peaches to the liquid and over medium-high heat bring the liquid to a
slow boil, carefully separating the frozen slices. This will take
about 3 to 4 minutes. Once the liquid returns to a boil, cook until
the peaches are just warmed through, about 3 minutes. Turn off the
heat and let the peaches cool in the syrup. Place 2 crepes folded in
quarters on each plate. (Leave the extra 2 crepes for seconds.) Spoon
the peaches over the crepes and top with vanilla yogurt or softly
whipped cream, if desired. Serve at once.

Crepes Suzette

deserts

      ----CREPE BATTER----
125 gm flour (4.5 oz)
15 gm sugar (0.5 oz)
1 pinch salt
2  eggs
3 deciliter milk, boiled and cooled - (5/8 pint; )
1 deciliter double cream ( 3.5 fl oz)
1 tablespoon curagao
1  clarified butter for the pan
      ----SAUCE----
6  sugar lumps
2  oranges
180 gm softened butter ( 6 oz)
180 gm sugar
3 tablespoon curagao

THE BATTER: Put the flour, sugar and salt in a bowl and stir in the
eggs, one at a time, with a wooden spatula. Pour in one-third of the
milk and mix until smooth and homogenous. Stir in the cream, the rest
of the milk and the curagao, cover the bowl with a plate and leave
the batter to stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour before
cooking the crepes. COOKING THE CREPES: Brush the pan with clarified
butter and heat it. Ladle in a little batter, tilt the pan to spread
it thinly over the base and cook the crepe for about 1.5 minutes,
then turn it over with a palette knife and cook for about 1.5 minutes
more, until golden on both sides. Place the crepe on a plate and make
more crepes in the same way: you should end up with 18 crepes ! THE
SAUCE: Rub the sugar lumps again the orange skin to absorb as much
flavour as possible. With a wire whisk, work together the softened
butter and sugar, then add the curagao and sugar lumps. SERVING:
Squeeze the orange juice into a pan, set over high heat and reduce by
half. Bring the pan to the table, set it on a spirit stove - or a
fondue heater - and beat the butter mixture into the orange juice,
bringing the mixture to the boil. As soon as the sauce bubbles, lift
one crepe at a time with a fork and spread it in the sauce, turn it
over and fold into quarters. Repeat with all the crepes. --

1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 cup brown sugar; firmly packed
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2  eggs
1/2 cup pumpkin (canned)
4 tablespoon raisins or dried currants; f

Recipe by: Better Homes and Gardens New Crockery Cooker In small bowl
combine flour, baking powder and pumpkin pie spice; set aside.

In med. mixing bowl combine brown sugar and oil; beat till well
combined. Beat in eggs. Add pumpkin; mix well. Add flour mixture.
Beat just until combined. Stir in raisins.

Pour pumpkin mixture into 2 well-greased and floured 1/2-pint
straight-sided canning jars. Cover jars tightly w/greased foil. Place
a piece of crumpled foil in 3-1/2 or 4 qt. crockery cooker with liner
in place. Place jars atop crumpled foil.

Cover; cook on high setting for 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours or until a
wooden toothpick inserted near centers comes out clean.

Remove jars from cooker; cool 10 minutes in jars. Remove bread from
jars. Cool thoroughly on wire rack.
Makes 2 loaves.

FOR 3-1/2 to 4 QUART CROCKPOTS--Halve all ingredients.

WARNING: Use only CANNING JARS for this recipe. Others may not be
tempered to withstand the heat.  Do NOT use coffee or vegetable cans
as most contain lead and are painted or sealed with materials that
may give off toxic gases when heated.

This recipe doesn't say you can seal them up and store them in your
pantry but my Kerr Canning book recipe says you can; here's how:

Remove jars from the oven one at a time, wipe rim of jar clean; put
on lid and ring and screw on tightly.

Jars will seal as the cake cools.  Store like canned goods.

If you'll be giving these as gifts, take a piece of decorative cloth
(about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid or as large as
you'd like) and put it on top of the lid, then screw on the ring.
Make sure you screw the lid on very tightly. I like to use pinking
shears to cut the cloth out with.

bag with a 1/4" tip to fill the tiny puffs with whipped cream.
Preheat oven to 375. Boil water and butter together. Remove from
heat, ad flour all at once beating rapidly till dough forms a ball.
(If it doesn't, put it back over medium heat and keep beating.)  Cool
7 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating frantically after each
till dough is smooth. Butter and flour cookie sheets and drop by
small teaspoonfuls 2" apart and bake 16 minutes until brown and
puffed. Put a little slit in each one, put them back in oven for 10
minutes more. Cool completely. Fill them from bottom with whipped
cream. Refrigerate till ready to assemble. Make the caramel and pile
puffs into a pyramid using caramel as glue - dip bottoms. Make th
chocolate and dribble it over all. CARAMEL FILLING: Bring to a simmer
~ swirl pan till sugar dissolves.  Cover, bring to boil, when bubbles
are thick, uncover and swirl till light brown - remove from heat.
CHOCOLATE TOPPING: Stir constantly over low heat till melted. Sauce

2 tablespoon corn syrup

Preheat the oven to 425.  To make the puffs, melt the butter in the
water with salt and sugar.  Remove from heat, add the flour, return
to heat and beat vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes. (A film should form
on the bottom of the pan.)  Cool slightly, and add eggs, one at a
time, beating vigorously. Using a pastry tube with a 1/2 inch
opening, form 1-inch-high mounds, 3/4 inch in diameter, on
parchment-lined baking sheet. Glaze and smooth the tops.  Bake for 20
to 25 minutes, until puffed and golden. Cool on racks. To make the

mixture is thick and pale yellow.  Beat in the flour, Scald the milk
and add in dribbles, reserving 1/2 cup for thinning. Return to clean
pot and stir vigorously over high heat until mixture boils and
thickens. If it seems too thick to pipe, add reserved milk. Remove
from heat. Add the butter, 1 Tbsp at a time. Melt the chocolate and
add to mixture with the expresso.  Just before assembling
croquembouche, inject the cream into the puffs with a 1/4-inch pastry
tip. To make the caramel, bring sugar, water, and corn syrup to a
boil over high heat. Do not stir. Cover pan until steam dissolves any
crystals. Uncover and boil 5 minutes, or until syrup is amber. Remove
from heat. Dip the bottoms of the puffs, one by one, into the caramel

Croquembouche (4)

deserts, french

      ----PUFFS (PATE A CHOUX----
1 1/2 each sticks unsalted butter
1 1/2 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 cup flour
6 each large eggs
      ----GLAZE----
1 each egg beaten with 1 tsp water
1 each pastry cream (creme patissie
6 each egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup sifted flour
2 cup milk, scalded
3 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon cognac
1 each pinch salt
      ----NOUGAT----
2 cup sugar
1 each juice of 1/2 lemon
1 1/2 cup toasted finely ground almond
      ----CARAMEL----
2 cup sugar
2/3 cup water
2 tablespoon corn syrup

Use Pastry Cream (Creme Patissiere) for filling. Preheat oven to 425
degrees.  To make the puffs, melt the butter in the water with salt
and sugar over low heat. Remove from heat and beat in flou with a
wooden spoon until completely mixed.  Return to heat and stir
vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes.  Mixture will form a mass, and a film
will form on bottom of pan. Remove from heat and, one by one, add
eggs, beating vigorously after each addition. Using a pastry tube
with 1/2-inch opening, form puffs on a buttered baking sheet. Glaze
each puff with the beaten egg and water, using a pastry brush Smooth
the top of each puff. Put in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove from
oven and pierce each puff with a sharp knife. (This allows the steam
to escape so that the interior of the puff is not soggy.) Return to
the oven for 10 minutes more. Cool puffs on a rack. While cooling,
prepare pastry cream. To make the cream, beat the egg yolks,
gradually adding the sugar, until mixture is thick and pale yellow.
Beat in the flour. Add the hot milk in dribbles, reserving 1/2 cup
for thinning. Return to pot in which milk was scalded, and stir
mixture over high heat until it comes to a boil.  It will become
lumpy first and then will smooth out with vigorous stirring.  Be
careful not to scorch the bottom of the pot. The cream should be
thick, bu add milk if too thick to pipe. Add the butter, 1 Tbsp at a
time. Flavor with vanilla, cognac and salt. Cool completely. Inject
the pastry cream into the puffs with a 1/4-inch pastry tip. To make
nougat, melt the sugar with the lemon juice in a heavy pot. Do not
stir. Boil together until a thick amber syrup is formed. Stir in the
almonds and spread the mixture on an oiled marble slab while warm.
Cut wit a sharp knife into a round for the base, and into small
triangles for decoration. Keep nougat warm in a 250 degree oven. (It
cannot be cut or shaped if it hardens.) To make the caramel, bring
the ingredients to a boil over high heat. Do no stir. Cover pan
(allowing steam to dissolve any crystals that might form). Uncover
pan and boil several more minutes, until syrup is amber.  Reduce heat
to keep syrup from hardening. Dip the filled cream puffs, one by one,
into the caramel syrup and arrange on the nougat base, forming a cone
resembling a pyramid.  The caramel holds the cream puffs together.
Note: Assemble the croquembouche the day of the party, as it cannot
be refrigerated. However, the cream puffs, pastry cream, and nougat
can be prepared in advance.

Crostata Di Fichi E Lamponi

deserts, italian

      ----PASTA FROLLA SEMPLICE----
      ----SIMPLE SWEET DOUGH----
1 cup flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 pinch salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup butter
1 large egg

1  egg yolk
4 tablespoon soft butter
1  egg
3 tablespoon flour
12  ripe figs  peeled and quartered
1/2 pint raspberries

pieces and distribute evenly over dry ingredients in work bowl. Pulse
until very finely powdered. Add egg and continue to pulse until dough
forms a ball that revolves on blade. Remove dough, press into a disk,
wrap and chill.

FOR THE ALMOND FILLING: Combine almond paste, sugar and yolk and beat
by machine until smooth. Beat in butter, scrape bowl and beaters and
beat in egg. Continue beating until light. Stir in flour. Roll dough

Crostata Di Fragole

deserts, italian

      ----PASTA FROLLA ALLE MANDORLE----
      ----SWEET DOUGH W/ALMONDS----
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup ground blanched almonds
1/4 cup sugar
1 pinch salt
5 tablespoon cold unsalted butter
1  egg
      ----FOR THE STRAWBERRIES----
3 pint ripe strawberries
2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup strawberry jam
1  confectioners' sugar  for finishing

Use a sharp knife to cut the crostata to keep the berries from
toppling and lessening the elegant symmetry of the dessert.

FOR THE PASTA FROLLA: Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix
well. Rub in the butter until it is absorbed. Make sure the mixture
remains cool and powdery and does not become pasty. Beat the egg and
stir in with a fork. Continue stirring until the dough holds
together, then knead it smooth, briefly. Shape into a disk, wrap in
plastic and refrigerate at least
1    hour, or until firm.

FOR THE STRAWBERRIES: Rinse and hull berries. Choose the best ones to
border the tart (draw a 9-inch circle on wax paper and arrange berries
inside to see how many you need). Slice remaining berries into a
bowl; add sugar and lemon juice. Toss to combine and cover with
plastic wrap. Refrigerate the sliced and whole berries until ready to
assemble the crostata. Preheat oven to 350F and set a rack in the
middle level. To form tart base, roll three-quarters of the dough on
a floured surface to a 9-inch disk. Transfer to a cookie sheet lined
with parchment or buttered wax paper. Place a 9-inch disk, like a
spring- form bottom, on dough and trim to a 9-inch diameter. Pierce
the dough all over with a fork at 1/2-inch intervals. Combine the
scraps with the remaining dough and roll it into a thin cylinder,
about 30-inches long. Moisten the edge of the base with water and
arrange the cylinder of dough on it, to form sides on the tart shell.
Press the cylinder with fingertip to make it adhere and mark a series
of diagonal lines on it with the back of a small knife. Bake about 25
minutes, until the dough is an even golden color and feels firm when
pressed with fingertip. Cool the tart shell on a rack on the pan.
Place cooled shell on a platter. Spread bottom evenly with jam.
Arrange a row of the whole strawberries inside the edge. Drain sliced
berries well; pile in center. Dust with sugar.

smooth, shape into a ball and chill for about 30 minutes. Roll out
lightly in a circle, cut edges and keep dough about 1 inch larger
than a 8- to 9-inch (diameter) fluted flan tin. Butter and flour the
pan and fit the pastry into it, again trim the edges, prick with fork
and flute edges. Place in preheated oven at moderate heat for 15 to
20 minutes.

thickened and a light lemon color. Beat in flour and vanilla. Over
medium heat, bring milk just to the boil. Let it cool for a moment,
then add it to the egg mixture, whisking rapidly. Cook over low heat
until the pastry cream thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden
spoon. Cool. When cream pasticcera is cool, spread evenly on the
bottom of the pie. Fill with whatever fresh fruits are available,
glaze with an apricot jam. Melt apricot jam glaze with a little hot
water.

Cuscus Dolce (Dessert Couscous)

deserts, italian

      ----CUSTARD CREAM----
60  pistachio nuts
1  coarse-grained salt
5  extra-large eggs
8 tablespoon sugar
1 cup heavy cream; cold
1/2 cup milk; lukewarm
2 tablespoon rosewater
      ----COUSCOUS----
1 lb couscous (not instant)
1 cup water; cold
1/2 teaspoon salt
      ----FOR THE STEAMER----
3 1/2 cup flour
1 cup water; cold
      ----TO FLAVOR THE COUSCOUS----
2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar
5 drop vanilla extract
2 oz semisweet chocolate
3 oz almonds; toasted
2 oz candied citron
2 oz candied orange peel

In Sicily, couscous is even a dessert, incorporating the age-old
Mediterranean almonds, rosewater, pistachio nuts, candied citron, and
orange peel as well as chocolate and custard cream, which most likely
were added in later centuries.

Prepare the custard cream. Blanch the pistachio nuts in a pan of
boiling water with coarse salt added (otherwise the nuts will turn
yellow). Dry the nuts with paper towels, then finely chop them on a
board or grind them in a food processor. Place the egg yolks in a
medium-sized crockery or glass bowl, add the sugar, and use a wooden
spoon to mix the sugar into the yolks until they turn a lighter
color. Slowly add the cream, then the lukewarm milk, mixing steadily.
Add the chopped nuts and the rosewater, and mix very well. Place in
the top of a double boiler.

Bring water to a boil in the bottom of the double boiler. When the
water begins to boil, insert the top, making sure the water does not
touch it, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon, always in the same
direction. When the cream coats the spoon, just before it boils
(absolutely do not allow the cream to boil), remove the top of the
double boiler from the heat and continue to stir the contents for 1
minute more. Transfer the custard to an empty wine bottle (to keep
skin from forming), cork it, and refrigerate until needed.

Prepare the couscous: Spread out the grain on a large serving platter
or cookie sheet. Dissolve the salt in a small bowl with 1 cup of the
water. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the salted water on the grain, then
use the fingers of one hand to rub some grains against the palm
itself, using a rotating motion to incorporate the water evenly into
the grain. Keep repeating this with additinal teaspoons of salted
water and grains until you have used up 1/4 cup of water and the
couscous is evenly wet all over. Spread the grain evenly over a
cotton dish towel and let rest for 1 hour.

Put 8 cups of water in stockpot. Put a strainer or steamer which fits
snuggly over stockpot. Using the flour and a cup of cold water,
prepare a thcik dough to seal the area connecting the two halves of
the steamer. Roll this dough into a thick rope long enough to fit
around the perimeter of the pot. Using the rope of dough, cover the
circle where the top and bottom parts of the steam meet to seal it.
Place the steamer over medium heat, and when the water reaches a boil
and the steam begins to rise through the holes of the strainer, add
the couscous grain. (It is also convenient to spread a cheesecloth
over the strainer holes to facilitate removing the steamed grains.)
Cover tightly with a lid and steam for 30 minutes.

Spoon out the couscous onto a large platter and start rubbing the
grains between the palms of your hands, incorporating the remaining
3/4 cup of salted water, little by little to separate any that have
stuck together and to retain an even and uniform consistency of
individual grains. Let the couscous rest for 1 hour until cool.

Mix the granulated and confectioners' sugar with the vanilla in a
large bowl. Cut the chocolate into pieces the size of half an almond.
Cut the toasted almonds in half and the candied fruit into pieces the
same size. Add the couscous, chocolate, and almonds to the bowl with
the sugar and mix very well. Transfer the couscous to a large serving
platter and arrange it in one thick layer. Pour the cooled custard
cream over the couscous and serve, spooning out the sweet grain
topped with custard sauce.

Cuscusu Di Pistachi

deserts, fruits/nuts, italian

      ----FOR SEALING THE PAN----
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup water
      ----COUSCOUS----
1 cup couscous, not instant
3 cup water
      ----FLAVORING & 2ND STEAMING----
1 tablespoon water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup shelled green pistachios  unsalted; and very green
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup almond oil =or=- mild vegetable oil
      ----FINISHING----
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon water
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 oz semisweet chocolate  finely grated
1  candied cherries =or=- other candie; d fruit  (to garnish)

Couscous is normally a savory dish found in Morocco. This unusual
dessert version is the specialty of a small convent in Sicily.

FIRST PREPARE THE PAN for steaming the couscous: For the sealing
dough, mix the flour and water together in a bowl and scrape onto a
floured work surface. Knead briefly to form a rough, sticky dough,
adding a tablespoon or 2 of flour if necessary. Roll into a rope as
long as the circumference of the bottom pan and apply the dough to
the rim of the pan. Add water to the pan so that the water is below
the bottom of the couscousiere or colander and press the couscousiere
into place. Bring the water to a boil on high heat, until steam is
escaping freely through the perforations, then lower to a simmer, so
that the steam escapes very gently. While the water is coming to a
boil, prepare the couscous to be cooked: Place the grain in a bowl
and add the water. Swish the water through the grain with the fingers
of one hand splayed apart, "raking" through it. Tilt the bowl and
drain away excess water. Set aside for 5 minutes. Line the
couscousiere with a dampened napkin or cheesecloth and add the grain.
Cover and steam 15 minutes. While the grain is cooking, prepare the
flavoring. Half fill a saucepan with water and add the pistachios.
Bring to a boil; drain in a strainer. Pour the pistachios onto a
towel, fold the towel over them and rub to loosen skins. Separate
pistachios from skins, going over them carefully. Combine the freshly
blanched pistachios, extract and cinnamon in a food processor bowl
and process for 2-3 minutes, until very finely ground and starting to
become pasty. Add the oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue
processing mixture to a smooth paste, stopping the machine and
scraping the inside of the bowl 3-or-4 times. Reserve pistachio
paste. After the couscous has steamed 15 minutes, remove it from the
couscousiere in the cheesecloth and put it in a large, non-reactive
roasting pan. Spread it out with a fork and let cool. Combine the
salt and water and work it into the cooled couscous, raking it
through with 1 hand. Add the pistachio paste in 3-or-4 additions,
working it in by rubbing it and the couscous together with the
fingertips. Return the water in the bottom pan to a simmer, and line
the couscousiere again with the dampened cheesecloth. Add the
seasoned couscous to the couscousiere, cover and steam 15 minutes.
Remove the couscous to the roasting pan, spread out with a fork,
without compressing the mixture, and leave uncovered until cool. To
finish the couscous, bring the sugar and water to a boil, stirring to
dissolve all sugar granules, and cool the syrup. Work the cooled
couscous between the palms of the hands again to separate the grains
and toss in the syrup in 5-or-6 additions, fluffing the couscous with
a fork. Allow the couscous to dry uncovered, several hours, in a cool
place, fluffing it with a fork occasionally, until all the grains are
separate. For advance preparation, cover tightly with plastic wrap
and refrigerate up to several days. To serve, fluff up with a fork so
the grains separate well and mound the couscous on a platter.
Sprinkle the couscous evenly with the grated chocolate, then the
confectioners' sugar. Decorate with no more than 5-or-6 pieces of the
candied fruit.

Dandelion Jelly

deserts, jam/jelly

1 quart dandelion blossoms
2 quart water
2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 3/4 oz powdered fruit pectin
5 1/2 cup sugar

Pick bright, fresh dandelion blossoms and pack the quart container
pretty tightly.  This is going to require a lot of dandelion
blossoms! Rinse quickly in cold water to remove any insects/dirt on
the petals. Don't leave the blossoms in the water for very long
though, as they will be a little the worse for wear.

Next, pull up a chair somewhere comfortable, as this part is going to
take awhile...Snip off the stem and green collar under each blossom,
so that only the petals are left. This takes about four hours!

In an enamel saucepan, boil the dandelion petals in water for 3
minutes, or a little longer, until the water takes on their color. (I
boiled the petals for 4 minutes until I liked the color better.)

Cool and strain, pressing against the petals with your fingers to
extract all of the dandelion juice.  (Or you can cheat and line a
sieve with moistened cheesecloth and strain it that way.)

Measure out 3 cups of dandelion liquid.  Add the lemon juice and fruit
pectin.  Stir to combine.

Bring to a boil, using a large kettle.  Add the sugar, stirring to mix
well. Continue stirring and boil the mixture for 2 and 1/2 minutes.

Pour into hot sterilized jelly jars and seal.  Process for five
minutes in a boiling water bath.

Yield:  Five 1/2 pint jars.

Death By Vanilla Pudding

deserts

1 cup tapioca; small pearl
1 quart whole cream
2 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup sugar; brown
4  eggs; large
3 teaspoon vanilla; madagascar bourbon

soak tapioca in 2 cups cold water in refrigerator overnight. Drain and
place in a large sauce pan with cream and 2 cups water. Bring to a
boil, add sugar and vanilla slowly, stirring the whole time (it will
get very thick very fast and lump if you don't)   Beat eggs to a
froth, add to pudding mixture.  Simmer for 5 minutes (until eggs are
set with the rest of the pudding) Chill overnight, warm each serving
(microwave works best) and serve. This is a very rich pudding. Most
people will not want very much, however they will savor each bite! If
you do not chill the pudding overnight you are missing the chance to
taste the best vanilla pudding you have ever allowed you pallet to
enjoy. The vanilla called for in the recipe may be purchased through
williams sonoma (direct or mail order) or may be replaced with any
GOOD real vanilla extract such as found in many fine cooking stores.
I have tried it with "american" vanilla extracts but keep returning
to the madagascar.

2  chinese brown slab sugar (sticks)-; =or=-
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 cup sweet red bean paste
1/2 cup sesame seeds
1  peanut oil for deep-frying

PLACE THE GLUTINOUS RICE POWDER in a mixing bowl. Bring the water to
a boil and add the sugar; stir until completely dissolved. Pour sugar
water into the rice powder; stir until well mixed. Gather the dough
into a ball and knead until smooth. Cut dough in half and roll each
half into two 10-inch long rolls. Cut each roll into 10 pieces. Take
one piece and roll into a ball. Flatten it and place a 1/2-inch round
piece of sweet red paste into the center of dough. Fold over sides to
enclose filling and roll into a ball. Repeat until all the balls are
made. Wet your hands with water and roll one ball in your hands to
moisten the ball. Dip the ball into a dish of sesame seeds until the
entire surface is covered. Press lightly to help the seeds adhere.
Add enough oil to a wok to a depth of 2 1/2-inches. Heat to 350F.
Deep fry balls for 8 to 10 minutes. As they expand in the oil, take a
pair of chopsticks and squeeze the balls to help them expand and fill
with air. The balls should triple in size, float to the top of the
oil and turn golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels. Makes
about 20 balls.

Boil the water and sugar together in a large saucepan, uncovered, for
3 minutes.  Fill the jars with the syrup, leaving 1/2" of headspace.
Remove any bubbles, adding more syrup if necessary. Seal jars
according to manufacturer's directions; process for 15 minutes in a

Witty writes: "Blueberries in brandied syrup can launch several
dessert possibilities.  Add spoonfuls of berries and syrup to fresh
autumn fruit - diced apples or pears, or both and sliced blue plums -
for an instant compote; ladle berries and syrup over ice cream, or
angel cake, or a vanilla-flavored rice pudding or blanc mange; fill
meringue shells with the berries and top them with whipped cream; or
layer the fruit and syrup with lightly whipped fresh ricotta in
parfait glasses."

Divinity

2  egg whites
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup light corn syrup
2 cup white or brown sugar*
1 tablespoon vinegar*
1 cup broken nutmeats
1 cup white raisins

If you use the brown sugar and vinegar, you may prefer to call this
Sea Foam. 1. Bring egg whites to room temperature. 2. Bring water and
corn syrup to a boil in a heavy pan. Add white or
brown sugar and vinegar, and stir until dissolved. 3. When
boiling, cover pan and cook about 3 minutes until the steam has
washed down any crystals that may have formed on the sides of the
pan. 4.  Remove lid and cook over moderate heat, without stirring, to
the hard
ball stage, about 250F.  While syrup is cooking, beat egg whites
in
a large bowl until they just hold their shape. When the syrup is
ready, pour it slowly over the egg whites in a steady thin stream,
whipping slowly at the same time.  Toward the end, add the syrup
more quickly and whip faster.  Do not scrape pan. 5. After all the
syrup has been added, put in nutmeats and raisins. 6. Beat until
candy can be dropped onto a buttered surface into patties
which hold their shape. ~--

must be rebuttered and floured for each layer. Preheat the oven to
375 degrees. Sift the flour with the salt and beat the eggs with the
electric mixer and add the sugar gradually. Fold in the flour, taking
care not to overmix. Divide the mixture into six portions and spread
each portion on the marked circles. Bake for 6-8 minutes or until the
eges are very lightly browned. Trim the edge of each circle with a
knie and lift the cake onto a wire cooling rack. Put aside 1 circle
on alightly oiled baking pan. This will be covered with caramel to
make the top layer of the finished cake. To prepare the butter cream,
put the sugar and water in a small heavy saucepan and cook until the
mixture reaches 218 degrees on a candy thermometer. Add the syrup to
the lightly beaten egg yolks and beat in the butter a little at a
timeed cake layer. Cover the sides with butter cream. Press the
grated chocolate against the sides of the cake. Deocrate the top of
the caramelized layer with piped butter cream. Leave the cake to
season for 6 hours in the refrigerator before serving. Dobos Torta -

Do-It-Yourself Soused Peach Soup

deserts, fruits, soups

1 1/2 lb peaches; ripe freestone
1/2 cup sugar
1/2  lemon; juice only
3  or 4 gratings nutmeg
4 cup heavy cream or ice cream; melted
1  liqueurs and brandies
1  cookies

"An incredible dessert invitation to extend to special summer guests
when fresh fruit is at its best and you're feeling a little
extravagant. Who could resist the temptation to "mix your own" when
it comes to fruit puree, heavy cream, and a choice of liqueurs or
brandies?"

To facilitate peeling, place the peaches (or use nectarines) in
boiling water for 1 minute. Using a small, sharp knife slit the skin
and remove. Then pit and quarter the fruit and place it in a small
saucepan with water to cover, sugar, lemon juice, and nutmeg. Simmer
until tender, depending on the ripeness of the fruit, about 10 to 15
minutes. Cool. Puree or pass through a sieve and chill.

Serve in chilled bowls or very large parfait glasses. Pass the
pitcher of cream or melted ice cream, and cookies, and have on the
table a selection of liqueurs and brandies, depending on your taste
and pocketbook. I suggest any combination of the following:

creme de banana, cherry brandy, Amaretto, curacao, bourbon, anisette,
rum, sherry, coffee liqueur, Tuaca.

Also experiment with the softened ice cream; it need not be vanilla,
but should be delicate. The cookies could be any of your favorites,
but simple rich ones like macaroons or butter cookies such as Snowy
Cardamom Crisps are an unequalled match for this soup.

Doris's Pralines

cajun, candy

4 cup sugar
5 cup pecans
4 tablespoon karo syrup
1 tablespoon butter
1 can condensed milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 can water

Mix all ingredients except butter, vanilla, and pecans. Cook on low
fire until the mixture forms a soft ball in cold water. Remove from
fire. Add butter, vanilla, and pecans, and beat until the mixture
holds its shape. Spoon onto buttered wax paper (Add old newspaper
under your wax paper.) If candy gets hard before all is spooned out,
add a little water, and heat over.  Or you can let it stand on low
heat while spooning out. If you have never tasted freshly made
pralines, made from fresh Louisiana pecans, you have just never
really lived. Justin Wilson says, "Doris is the much better half
(wife) of my good friend Gordon Martin, the sheriff of St. James
Parish.  Every Christmas Eve we go by to see them after watching the
bonfires that are burned on the levees along the Mississippi River to

Double Cappuccino Heaven

deserts, low cal

1 1/2 cup superfine sugar
3/4 cup cake flour
1/3 cup cocoa  preferably dutch process
2 tablespoon instant espresso powder
2 cup egg whites (1 c equals about 8 larg; e)
1 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
      ----CAPPUCCINO FLUFF FROSTING----
2 large egg whites
1/2 tablespoon superfine sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
12  marshmallows  each cut into 8 piece; s  (use scissors)
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon cocoa  preferably dutch process
2 teaspoon instant espresso powder
1 pinch salt

Angel cake is not only no-cholesterol and no-fat but absolutely
delicious with a light, puffy texture. Here, the cappuccino flavor is
so deep that it's hard to believe that it lacks any fat at all.
PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F with rack in center of oven. Have an ungreased
10-inch tube pan ready. Divide sugar in half. Sift 1/2 3 times. Set
aside. Sift other half with flour, cocoa and espresso powder 3 times.
Set aside. Put egg whites in 4-quart grease-free bowl. Beat on low
speed with mixer until frothy. Add cream of tartar and salt. Increase
speed to medium. Beat until whites are whipped and hold their shape
but are still soft and moist. Add 3/4 cup sifted sugar, 1 tablespoon
at a time, beating well after each addition, until all sugar is
added. Add vanilla. Stop beating when whites have increased in volume
about fivefold, hold their shape and are shiny and smooth. Gently but
thoroughly fold in flour mixture, by thirds. Transfer to baking pan.
Smooth surface with spatula. Cut through batter in 6 places to break
any large air pockets. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes
out clean, about 35-to-40 minutes, laying piece of foil lightly over
top if it gets too brown. Invert and rest tube on inverted custard
cup. Prop pan extensions with crumpled foil to secure pan. Cool
completely. When cake is completely cool, use flexible knife to
loosen it from sides of pan. Invert onto rack. Keep cake at room
temperature 2 days, well covered, or frozen (airtight) as long as 3
months. Be sure to thaw at room temperature in wrapping. Frost.
CAPPUCCINO FLUFF FROSTING: Put egg whites, sugar and corn syrup in
top of double boiler. Place over simmering water. Immediately use
mixer at medium speed to beat ingredients until fluffy, white and
warmed through, about 5 minutes. Stir in marshmallows. Once combined,
beat at lowest speed until marshmallows are melted and mixture is
smooth. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla, cocoa, espresso and salt.
Spread on top and sides of cake. Yield: frosting for 1 10-inch tube
cake.

Double Caramel Flan

deserts, mexican

1/3 cup sugar
2 cup milk
2/3 cup caramel powder (recipe precedes)
6 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla

In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan, frequently shake sugar over
medium heat until all is melted and the color is deep amber, 3 to 5
minutes. Immediately pour into an 8- to 9-inch diameter
straight-sided baking dish or pan (at least 1-qt. size).  Quickly
rotate dish to coat bottom.

In a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan over medium-high heat, stir milk and
caramel powder until all the caramel melts (it hardens first), about
7 minutes. In a bowl, whisk some hot liquid with eggs and vanilla;
stir back into pan. Remove from heat.

Pour mixture into prepared baking dish.  Set dish in a larger rimmed
pan, pour 1 inch boiling water into outer pan. Bake in a 350F oven
until center of flan jiggles only slightly when gently shaken, 35 to
45 minutes.

Remove dish with flan from water.  Let cool, then cover and chill for
at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. To serve, run a thin knife between
flan and dish. Invert platter over flan; holding together, invert.
Lift off pan. Cut into wedges.

Makes 8 servings.

Drinking Custard

beverages, deserts

1 pint milk
1 pint heavy cream
1 cup sugar
12  egg yolks
1 tablespoon flour

Eggnog is essentially a dessert sauce called creme anglaise. The
addition of flour to this recipe is unorthodox but it enables you to
boil the sauce without curdling it.

HEAT MILK, CREAM AND SUGAR in a saucepan and bring just to a boil.
(Do not stir--leaving the sugar on the bottom of the pot will prevent
the milk from scorching.) Beat the egg yolks and flour together with
a wire whisk. Add about a cup of the hot milk mixture to the yolks
and whisk to blend. Then whisk the yolk mixture into the mixture in
the saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil gently for
10 seconds, then remove from heat and strain into a bowl, discarding
the flour lumps. Chill and serve with rum, if desired.

Dulce De Leche

deserts, italian, puddings

1  gal milk.
8 cup sugar

First boil the milk on medium heat Add the sugar, stirr well and keep
stirring constantly, so that it doesn't stick on the bottom of the
pam. The milk will evaporate and the color will change to yellowish.

For a hard dulce de leche, let the milk evaporate till it gets very
thick in the pan you are cooking.  Then coat a a square pan with
butter, spread the contents on it & put it in the oven to dry for a
few minutes.

For a soft dulce de leche, don't let it get too thick while you
cooking it, then keep in a jar and eat as a spread.

It is really delicious. Sometimes I add peanuts or cinamon for a
variation. I am from Latin America, and talking about this bring me
good memories....

Enjoy! It ready when it changes the color from white to yellowish It
is very very simple.  But you need to keep an eye on the pan. Walt MM

Dulce De Mange (Mango Paste)

caribbean, deserts

1  text only

Dulces (literally sweets) like this one are common all over Latin
America. They are firm, sliceable pastes made from, for example,
quinces or sweet potatoes. Serving a slice of semi-soft cheese with a
similarly- sized slice of dulce is a popular dessert and the flavours
marry exceptionally well. This mango dulce originated in the
Caribbean.

Peel remove the flesh and process enough ripe mangoes to provide 2
cups of mango puree.

Scrape the puree into a saucepan and add 2 cups of white sugar and a
tablespoon of lime juice.

Cook over a medium heat, stirring all the time until the mixture
thickens sufficiently so that you can see the bottom of the saucepan
in the wake of the spoon.

Moisten the inside of a mould++a cake or loaf tin will do++scrape the
dulce into it and leave to cool.  When it is cold, turn out. It will
keep very well wrapped in plastic and refrigerated.

Dur Mou

eggs, german, spices, spreads

11 oz dark german chocolate
2  sticks sweet butter
1 cup superfine sugar
9  egg yolks
1  pinch salt
5  egg whites

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Melt the chocolate
with the butter in the top of a double boiler set over
simmering water.  Beat the sugar with the egg yolks
until smooth.  Mix this with the chocolate away from
the heat, adding it gradually.  Beat the egg whites in
a clean bowl with a tiny pinch of salt until stiff.
Using a metal spoon, fold the egg whites into the
chocolate mixture gently but thoroughly.
Have prepared a pair of 7-1/4 skillets oiled or
lined with non-stick baking parchment.  Divide
approximately two-thirds of the batter between the two
skillets, place into oven and bake for 1 hour.
Reserve the rest of cake batter/mousse and place in
refrigerator.
Once the cakes are baked, cool them then chill them
in the skillets. Take the reserved mousse from the
refrigerator and spoon it carefully over one of the
cakes (both now removed from their skillets).  Put the
other cake on top, to sandwich the two halves
together.  This ends up something between a souffle
and a squidgy cake.  It is wickedly rich - thus the 8
servings. :) From The Country Cook's Companion by

Easter Egg Nests

candy

1  dark chocolate candy
1  chow mein noodles
1  jelly beans

Melt the chocolate and let it cool slightly. Mix the chow mein
noodles into chocolate carefully so not to break them into smaller
pieces. When the chocolate is cooled sufficiently to handle, mold
this mixture into small bird shaped nests. Before the mixture has
time to harden, place the jelly beans or small candy easter eggs in
the bowl of the nest. They will stay put when mixture cools. Easy and
fun to make.Use your imagination as to items you could place in the
nests. ~--

Easter Mints Kids Can Make

candy, childrens

1/3 cup soft butter
1/3 cup light corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon flavoring
3 1/2 cup ( 1 lb ) sifted confectioner sugar
1  large bowl
1  wooden spoon
1  paper plates
1  pencils

This is a no-cook recipe the children can mix with their hands.
Flavor it with any of the liquid flavorings in the supermarket, such
as strawberry and lemon. If you want, you can instead divide it into
three portions and add a few drops of food coloring to tint it
yellow, red, and green. The knead a small amount of flavoring into
each one. This recipe makes about 1 1/2 lbs of candy. Help the
children measure all the ingredients into the large bowl. They can
take turns stirring it with the wooden spoon until it becomes too
stiff. Then they can knead it with their hands. They should continue
kneading until the dough is smooth. Give each child a paper plate and
a pencil. Tell them to turn their plates OVER and write their names
on the Bottom to prevent pencil lead from getting on their mints.
Help them hold their pencils correctly. Make sure they use upper and
lower case letters. Give each child a portion of dough on his or her
plate. The children can pinch off pieces, roll them into balls, and
press them lightly with a fork to make a fancy butter mint. Children
who cannot roll the candy into balls can make snakes, cut the snakes
into pieces, and press the pieces with a fork. They might eat the
pieces with the fork, but that's ok too. Leave the mints on the
plates and refrigerate them for 30 minutes, until they become firm.
Easter Mints taste even better the second day, if you can keep
everyone from eating them all on the first day.

Melt your coating mix. If you have white chocolate just add a drop or
two of green coloring(do not use the liquid kind) so that it is a

I use my old large electric fry pan if I am melting a lot of
different colors. You can also melt them in wide mouth jars, and keep
what you don't use. In bowl of melted coating mis in the coconut.

Easy Toffee

candy

1 lb butter
2 cup sugar, superfine
1 1/2 cup pecans; minced
10  hershey bars

Line a jelly roll pan with foil, and grease the foil with the
wrappers from the butter. Put the butter, sugar, and one cup of
pecans in a cold skillet. Bring to a boil over pretty high heat (I
use a 5-1/2 on a scale of 8, on the big burner of my stove), stirring
constantly. Boil 13 to 18 minutes (13 is always enough for me),
stirring *constantly*. DO NOT let up on the stirring, or it will
stick!  Pour into the jellyroll pan and spread. Let cool for a few
minutes, then place the chocolate bars on top. When the chocolate is
mushy, spread it evenly over the surface of the candy and sprinkle
with the remaining pecans.

Egg Custard Tarts

chinese, deserts

1  tart pastry:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup lard
1  egg
6 tablespoon sugar
2 cup sifted all purpose flour.
1  egg custard filling:
2  whole extra large eggs
3  extra large egg yolks
1 cup whole milk
1/2 cup half and half
1 cup sugar

Cream the butter with lard. Add egg and sugar. Beat well. Add flour,
1 cup at a time. The dough will be mealy. Work quickly with your
hands to gather dough into a ball. Knead lightly so the mixture
adheres. You may chill it at this point while making the filling.

Egg Custard Filling: Be sure all the ingredients are at room
temperature. Beat whole eggs at low speed with egg yolks well. Do not
over beat, add sugar, then milk, then half and half. Let mixture rest
10 - 15 minutes. Skim foam from mixture.

Separate dough into 24 ball. Press each into 2 1/2 inch tart shell to
an even layer across the bottom and all the way up the side. Fill
shell with filling almost to the top. Preheat oven to 300. Place
tarts on cooky sheet and bake for 45 minutes. Cool for 10 - 15
minutes. Loosen slightly by inserting a toothpick along the sides.
Tart shell should unmold easily.

Rhoda Yee's comments: It is important that the ingredients for the
filling be at room temperature and beaten over a bowl of warm water.
Cold ingredients will cause filling to separate during baking. By
skimming off the foam, the custard will have a golden, creamy
appearance with a velvety smooth texture which is a most unique and
delightful gastronomic treat! Do not bake at high heat, this will
cause the custard to bubble up like a balloon and burst.

Eggnog Bread Pudding

deserts, holiday

      ----PUDDING----
3 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
3/4 cup sugar
4 tablespoon unsalted butter; melted
1 3/4 cup half-and-half
3 tablespoon brandy
2 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon salt
6 slice dry cinnamon raisin bread  quartere; d
      ----CRANBERRYMAPLE SAUCE----
1/3 cup pure maple syrup
2 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 cup cranberries  if frozen, do not thaw
3 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 1/2 tablespoon bourbon

PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F 15 minutes before baking, with the rack in the
center of the oven. Butter a 6-cup souffle dish. Have a kettle of
boiling water ready and a baking pan large enough to hold the souffle
dish. Whisk the eggs, egg yolk and sugar until light. Mix in the
butter, the half-and-half, brandy, vanilla, nutmeg and salt. Place
the bread in the souffle dish and pour the custard over it. Press the
bread into the custard so it gets well soaked. Let rest 20 minutes.
Put the souffle dish in the baking pan and place on the oven rack.
Pour boiling water into the baking pan so it comes halfway up the
sides of the souffle dish. Bake until the custard is softly set in
the center, about 1 hour. Remove from the water bath. Serve warm or
at room temperature with Cranberry-Maple Sauce. Once cooled, the
pudding can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. To reheat, cover with
aluminum foil with several slits in it. Bake in a preheated 350F oven
for 20 minutes. Serve warm, or at room temperature with
Cranberry-Maple Sauce. CRANBERRY-MAPLE SAUCE: Bring the maple syrup
and sugar to a boil in a small non-aluminum pan, then cook for 3
minutes. Add the cranberries and cook until their skins burst and
they begin to pop, 6 to 8 minutes, or slightly longer if they are
frozen. Cut the butter into 3 pieces. Remove the pan from the heat
and whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, waiting until each is
incorporated before adding another. Add the bourbon. Sauce can be
served immediately or refrigerated for up to a week. Reheat gently
and thin with 2 to 3 tablespoons water before serving.

Flan

deserts, mexican

3/4 cup sugar
2  eggs
2  egg yolks
2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

In a small kettle, heat about 3 T of sugar with about 1 t of water until
the mixture turns brown. Pour the mixture into 4 gelatin molds. Move the
molds around so that the mixture coats the interior. Set aside.

Mix the eggs, sugar, milk and the vanilla extract.  Pour the mixture into
the molds. Put the molds over a deep pan with water (double boiler or bain
marie technique) for 1 hr in a 350 degree F. oven. Keep the water in the
pan at the same level by adding boiling water. Cool and put it in the
refrigerator. Unmold the flan before serving.

NOTES:

*  A rich Mexican custard -- This recipe comes from the "Delicias
Culinarias" cookbook that I brought from Mexico.

*  You can substitute liquor for some of the milk to make the flan richer.
Personally, I use about 1 cup of milk and about 1 cup rompope (Mexican
eggnog).

*  Be careful when coating glass molds as they can break because of the
sudden change in temperatures. You have to do it fast as the mixture
hardens very quickly.

Fondue Indienne

entree, fondue, parties

1  garlic clove, crushed
1 medium onion, grated
1 1/4 cup dry white wine
2 teaspoon curry powder (more or less, to tast; e)
2 tablespoon flour
2 1/2 cup cheddar cheese (matured), grated
1/4 cup fruit relish, spicy
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  pepper, freshly ground, to taste

Rub the bottom and sides of the fondue pot with the clove of garlic
before crushing it and using it in the next step.

Bring the garlic, onion, wine and curry powder to simmering point in
the fondue pot.  If you want to speed things along a little then you
can do this on the stove and then transfer the mixture to the fondue
pot.

Combine the grated cheese and flour by tossing in a plastic bag.
Gradually stir in the cheese, a handful at a time. Allow it to melt
completely between each addition. When all the cheese has been added
the mixture should be bubbling and smooth.

Stir in the relish.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Keep
the mixture warm over a burner, seat your guests down, fill their
wine glasses and enjoy your meal.

I often add more cheese than the recipe calls for. You can use any of
the following as dippers with the fondue:

:  o  Mushroom caps, sauteed quickly in butter, tossed in chopped
parsley :  o  Whole, peeled and deveined prawns
:  o  Fresh pineapple chunks
:  o  Canned artichoke hearts, well drained and halved
:  o  Unpeeled apple wedges, thick banana slices or peeled pear
quarters :  o  Thick cucumber slices or chunks
:  o  Small whole radishes
:  o  Cauliflower
:  o  A small French loaf per person
:  o  Anything else that tickles your fancy

NOTES:

*  Cheese fondue with curry flavor -- This is a very tasty meal and a
lot of fun as well. You will need to have a crockery fondue pot and a
burner, as all the cooking happens on your dinner table with your
guests doing all their own cooking! My wife and I enjoy a fondue with
dinner guests or simply by ourselves, and this is one of our
favourites. This recipe is adopted from one published by the
Australian Dairy Corporation many years ago.

*  Toss fruit in lemon juice to prevent browning.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  40 minutes preparation, cooking takes as long as it takes
you to eat it.

1/2 cup orange juice
2 cup fruit, cut into pieces
2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 cup yogurt, plain
2  egg whites

Combine sugar and orange juice in a saucepan.  Heat and stir until sugar is

Ginger Bread (Medieval/Elizabethan)

deserts

1 cup honey
1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger (generous)
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground licorice
1 3/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon anise seeds

Course Ginger Bread--Take a quart of Honey clarified, and seeth it
till it be brown, and if it be thick, put to it a dash of water: then
take fine crumbs of white bread grated, and put to it, and stir it
well, and when it is almost cold, put to it the powder of Ginger,
Cloves, Cinamon, and a little Licorice and Anise seeds: then knead
it, and put it into a mould and print it.  Some use to put to it also
a little Pepper, but that is according unto taste and
pleasure.--Gervase Markham, The English House-wife Gingerbread was
traditionally boiled rather than baked. This recipe is not
significantly different from medieval recipes found in fourteenth-
and fifteenth-century manuscripts, except for the licorice-a
brilliant touch.

Loaves of gingerbread, like squares of quince and other fruit pastes,
were often stamped with decorative designs. You may wish to
experiment with a cookie or butter press on the top of this little
loaf while it is still warm and malleable.

1.  In the top of a double boiler, heat honey.  Add spices except
anise seeds, and stir to blend. 2. Add bread crumbs and mix
thoroughly. Cover and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. Mixture
should be thick and moist. 3. Place gingerbread on a large sheet of
waxed paper. Fold up sides of paper and mold dough into small
rectangular shape. 4. Sprinkle anise seeds on top and press them
gently into dough with the side of a knife. 5. Cover and refrigerate
for 2 hours. 6. Serve gingerbread at room temperature in thin slices.

Gingerbread from Lucerne, the story:

There has always been a place for gingerbread on market stalls and at
fairs. It was customary for a young man to offer his sweetheart a
gingerbread cake, which she would acceptwith delight. Since the Middle
Ages, Lucerne has seen the creation of a large number of such
delicacies influenced by its governors and merchants.

The recipe:

Add the lemon juice to the cream and leave for a few minutes. Mix
together the cream, pear puree sugar, mixed spices and bicarbonate of
soda. Add the flour. Mix until well blended and then add the nuts.

Fill a flan ring (24 cm diameter, 6 cm high) and bake in the oven for
50 minutes at 190 oC.

Serve cold.

Ginger-Pineapple Pudding

deserts

1  20-oz  can crushed pineapple in its; own juice
1/4 cup lemon juice grated peel of 1 lemon; (i used more)
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon finely minced fresh ginger
3 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 3 t water

Mix all ingredients in a saucepan.  Cook over moderate heat, stirring
constantly, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Cool slightly

To gild the lily:

If you do make this into a pie, garnishing with sliced bananas glazed
with heated, strained apricot preserves makes it even more festive.

highly recommend it if, like me, you find making elaborate desserts
for non-vlf friends a relaxing and enjoyable thing to do every now
and then): Marlene Sororsky, _The Dessert Lovers Cookbook_, Harper

Girl Scout Samoa Chew Bars

deserts

1 pkg samoas cookies
1/4 cup melted margarine
1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
6 oz semi-sweet chocolate
2 oz butter
2 cup corn syrup
2 cup sugar
6  eggs
2 cup pecan halves
1/2 cup small semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-by-11-inch pan about 2 inches
deep, then line it with baking parchment. Process the Samoas cookies
and the graham cracker crumbs in a food processor, then add the
melted margarine. Pat this  mixture into the bottom of the pan.

Melt the semi-sweet chocolate and the butter together in one pan. In
another pan, combine the corn syrup and the sugar; heat until smooth.
Then add  it to the chocolate mix.

Add eggs to the mixture. Combine pecan halves and the small chocolate
chips to the mixture. Pour into crust and bake for 45 minutes to an
hour until center remains a little loose. This recipe is essentially
a chocolate pecan pie, creator Paul Philpot says, and when done will
be firm on top but a bit damp with a few cracks in the surface. Cool
before cutting.

Golden Wardens

deserts, fruits

6  pears
1  lemon
1  honey
8 fl oz white grape juice

Warden is the old name for the small hard cooking pear that used to
grow in many country gardens.  The best way to cook them was slowly
with honey and fruit juice to warm and round out their thin colour
and flavour, but this recipe works well for dessert pears too.

Choose a casserole or baking dish with just enough room to lay pears
head to tail in  single layer.  Peel the pears thinly, leaving the
stalks on, then immediately roll each one in a saucer containing the
juice of the lemon.  Put the pears into the dish. Spoon on scant 4
tablespoons honey and add any lemon juice remaining in the saucer.
Bring the grape juice to simmering point and pour it over the pears.
Cover the dish and bake at 325-350 F (160-180 C) gas mark 3-4 until
the fruit is beautifully tender. How long this will take varies
enormously - 1 hour is enough for semi-ripe dessert pears; 3 hours or
more may be needed for pears so hard that they seem to be carved from
wood. Baste the pears frequently as they bake and turn them
occasionally to encourage even cooking.

When the pears are ready, transfer them to a serving dish,
standing them upright.  Boil the cooking liquid until it turns syrupy
and is reduced by about half. Stir in an extra tablespoon or two of
honey if you think a little more sweetness is desirable but avoid the
temptation to make the juices too sweet; the appeal of the dish lies
in its fruitiness. Spoon the syrupy glaze over the pears.  Serve warm
or cold.

deserts

50 gm sugar
150 ml water
225 gm gooseberries
1  5-cm. vanilla stick
1  crme fraiche or greek yogurt to se; rve  (vegans omit)

Make this dessert in early summer when gooseberries come into season

simplicity, brings out the best in them.

Dissolve the sugar in the water with the vanilla stick, stirring, and
boil for 5 minutes until it is syrupy. Add the gooseberries to the
syrup and poach very gently for 10 minutes. Cool. Serve chilled, in
two glass dishes, with crme fraiche or Greek yogurt.

Graham Birdsnest Pudding

deserts

1  apples
1  flour
1 cup milk; sour
1/2 cup sugar
1/3 teaspoon baking soda

Lay in a deep dish, nice quartered apples, and pour over them a thin
batter made of flour, one teacup of sour milk, one-half cup of sugar
and about one third of a teaspoon of soda. Bake in a moderate oven
till the apples are thoroughly cooked.

Baked in the manner of a fruit cobbler, we assume this apple dish was
made with graham, or whole wheat flour, although white flour was
plentiful by 1861 and was preferred for dessert recipes. The quaint
name may have referred to its appearance and could have prompted
California Farmer to publish it.

Granny Smith Applesauce Tarts

deserts, tarts

      ----FOR THE APPLESAUCE----
6 large granny smith apples
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoon honey
      ----FOR THE PASTRY----
3/4 cup solid vegetable shortening
1/4 cup boiling (not just hot) water
1 tablespoon milk
1 tablespoon sugar
2 cup all-purpose flour, sifted

Peel and core the apples; cut into thin slices, to thicker than 1/4".
Put the apples, butter, lemon juice and honey in a heavy saucepan
with a lid. (Don't try using a lightweight pan; you need a heavy pan
that conducts heat well.) Cover tightly; cook over high heat for 10
minutes. Uncover. Stir to break up the apples into a smooth sauce. If
necessary, keep cooking until the applesauce is completely smooth,
stirring frequently to prevent burning or sticking. Set aside to
cool. (You may cook the applesauce in advance and refrigerate. Bring
back to room temperature before serving.)

Put the shortening in a large bowl. Add the boiling water. Stir
quickly to make a smooth mixture. Stir in the milk and sugar. Add the
flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition, until you
have used a total of 1 1/2 cup flour. After that, add flour only
until the dough clings together stiffly. Form the dough into a ball.
Flatten between sheets of wax paper, or wrap in plastic wrap and
refrigerate for at least 1 hour, to allow the dough to "relax."

After 15 minutes before you are ready to prepare the tart shells,
remove the dough from the refrigerator. Let it soften slightly. Roll
out the dough, either on a floured surface or between sheets of wax
paper, to a thickness of 1/8". Cut into six 4" circles, using a
plastic lid (such as that of the shortening can) or a cardboard
template as a guide. (You may save any leftover dough, well-wrapped,
in the freezer for up to
6    weeks.)

Preheat the oven to 400'F.

Turn a standard muffin tin upside down and gently drape a circle of
dough down the muffin shape, pressing in place lightly. Repeat with
the remaining dough circles, making certain the shells don't touch
one another (if possible, use a 12-muffin tin and skip spaces so the
tart shells don't touch.)

Bake the shells for 12-14 minutes, or until they're golden brown.
Allow the shells to cool slightly before gently removing them from
the muffin tin to finish cooling right side up on a wire rack. (You
may prepare the tart shells one day ahead and store in a covered
container.)

At serving time, fill each shell with 1/3 cup room-temperature
applesauce. If desired, drizzle with additional honey. You also may
warm the tarts briefly in the oven - 5 minutes at 350'F. (If you'd
like to gild the lily, serve with a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt or
low-fat "ice cream.")

Grape Nut Roll (Soutzouki)

candy, greek

1  karen mintzias
6 oz frozen grape juice; undiluted
1/2 cup sugar or honey
1 small box pectin jell
1  citric acid (pea-sized); *or* lemon, juice only, i
1/2 cup whole walnuts
3 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup cold water

Candied nuts and grape juice, "soutzouki", is an ancient candy recipe
still being used in the villages of Greece. The traditional recipe is
quite involved, calling for the stringing of walnuts like beads on
linen thread, boiling many pounds of grapes into a thick syrup and
coating the nuts by pouring the thick syrup over them just as if you
were making candies until a purple necklace is formed.  You can make
this recipe in a simpler way without having to stamp on the grapes
with bare feet.

In a large deep pot bring juice and honey or sugar to a vigorous
boil. Add pectin and boil 5 minutes. Dissolve citric acid first in a
tablespoon of hot syrup, then add to the rest of the syrup, mixing it
in. Add nuts. Dissolve cornstarch in cold water and mix into syrup,
stirring quickly. Cook 1 minutes more.
Ladle thick mixture on to heavy waxed paper.  Make a long thick
roll. Pick up two sides of paper and press together to make a fat
sausage of candy.  Let set at room temperature. Store in plastic bag.
Slice as needed.

Grape Tartlets With Almond Crust

fruits, tarts

      ----ALMOND CRUST----
1/4 cup almonds; slivered blanched
1 1/2 cup flour, all purpose salt
3 tablespoon brown sugar; firmly packed
1/2 cup butter; cold, unsalted,1stick cut
1 large egg; cold
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 teaspoon lemon zest; freshly grated
      ----GLAZE----
3/4 cup apricot preserves
3 tablespoon sherry
      ----TO ASSEMBLE----
3/4 lb grapes; preferably an assortment
1/4 cup almonds, slivered; lightly toasted

"Take these to a picnic in the pans that they were baked in to prevent
crushing. Assemble them not more than 6 hours before serving time.
For a single 10 inch tarts, bake the crust for 15 minutes with foil
in and a further 20 to 30 minutes empty."

Finely grind almonds in a food processor with on/off motion, or crush
with a rolling pin until as finely ground as possible. Add flour,
salt and brown sugar to processor and blend, or combine ground
almonds, flour, salt and brown sugar in a bowl and stir to blend. Add
butter and process or work with the fingertips until mixture
reassembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl beat egg lightly. Stir in
the vanilla and lemon zest. With a processor on, add egg mixture to
dough through feed tube and process until dough forms. Pat dough into
ball, wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for at least 30
minutes. Remove dough from refrigerator and divide into 8 equal
parts. Press each piece into a lightly buttered 3 to 3 1/2 inch
tartlet pan, preferably with removable rim, patting into an even
layer. (The dough will soften as you work with it.) Chill tartlet
shells in freezer for at least 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven
to 400F. remove tartlet shells from freezer, line each with a square
of foil, and fill with pie weights or dried beans to prevent dough
from puffing during baking. bake on baking sheet in center of oven
for 10 minutes. remove foil with weights, reduce oven temperature to
350F, and continue baking for 15 to 20 minutes, or until pastry is a
rich, golden brown. Let tartlet shells cool in pans and place on wire
racks to cool completely. To prevent glaze, combine preserves and
sherry in a small saucepan and warm over medium heat, stirring, until
preserves are melted. strain through a sieve. To assemble tarts,
brush tarts on the bottom of each tartlet shell. arrange grapes, cut
sides down, in a decorative pattern, alternating colors, in the
bottom of each pastry shell. Brush remaining glaze, reheating it if
necessary, over grapes and edges of tartlets. sprinkle toasted
almonds over tartlets before glaze sets. Serve at room temperature.

baking pan. Layer the pan with 12 individual sheets of filo,
buttering each with pastry brush as they are placed. Be careful to
cover the remaining sheets of filo with a slighlty damp twoel to
avoid drying them out. Wet the walnut mixture with a small amount of
butter and mix thoroughly. apply a layer of one-half of this mixture
into the pan. Next apply five more layers of filo as before, on top
of this. Layer next with remaining walnut mixture. Apply layers of
filo dough on top of this until all is used. Chill for one-half hour.
Cut rows of pastry length-wise and then cut diagonally to make
diamond shapes. Pour remaining butter evenly over top. Pre-heat oven
to 350 degrees F. and bake until golden brown (45min to 1 hour)  Pour
cooled syrup over the hot baklava until all is absorbed. Important:
syrup must be cooled and baklava hot to avoid sogginess.

Halvah

deserts

3 cup water
2 cup granulated sugar
1  cinnamon stick
3  whole cloves
1  lemon (peel only)
1/2 cup butter
1 cup coarse semolina or farina
4 tablespoon pine nuts
2 tablespoon blanched, chopped almonds
3 tablespoon whole blanched almonds

Combine the water, sugar, cinnamon stick, cloves, and lemon peel (or 1
tablespoon lemon juice) in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil
for 10 minutes, then cool. Meanwhile, slowly melt the butter in a
heavy saucepan, and cook for several minutes, without browning.
Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly add the semolina or
farina. Cook over low heat until the mixture turns a golden chestnut
color; do not brown. Add 2 tablespoons of the pine nuts and chopped
almonds and continue cooking 1 more minute. Remove cinnamon stick,
cloves, and peel from the cooled syrup. Gradually add the syrup to
the semolina mixture, stirring with a long-handled wooden spoon; the
mixture will bubble furiously. Cook over the lowest possible heat
until the syrup has been absorbed and the mixture thickens. Remove
from the heat and drape with a clean towel for 10 minutes. Turn into
a mold, spreading with a knife or a spatula. Cool, then reverse onto
a serving platter, sprinkle with cinnamon, and garnish decoratively
with the remaining pine nuts and the whole almonds. Cut into small,
diamond-shaped pieces.

Halvas Politikos

deserts, greek

1 cup olive oil
2 cup semolina
3 cup sugar
4 cup water
1  cinnamon, powdered

Dissolve the sugar in the water and bring it to a boil.  At the same time,
brown the semolina in the oil on high heat, stirring continuously.

When the semolina has taken a golden brown colour, add the syrup into it
(taking care not to burn your hands), turn down the heat and keep stirring
until you get a kind of thick porridge.  Pour into any kind of mold you can
think of (a cake-mold is perfect for the job), and let it cool.

Unmold into a platter and sprinkle with cinnamon.  Slice it using a wet
knife, serve, and watch your weight go sky high!

NOTES:

*  A Greek dessert with semolina -- This is a traditional greek dessert
that is extremely about tasty, and as easy to make as 1-2-3-4. Tasty.
Yield: fills a cake-mold.

*  You should be very careful pouring the syrup into the browned semolina,
as it is extremely hot, and pouring water on it causes an eruption of
scaldingly hot steam.

*  You should not put this dessert in the refrigerator.  It can keep for a
few days outside the refrigerator, assuming you can gather enough will
power not to eat it all at once. Some oil will start to drain off after a
day or so, but this is to be expected. Just make sure you don't leave the
dessert on your favourite tablecloth!

*  The recipe doubles, halves etc.  nicely as long as you keep the
proportion of the ingredients.

*  I have seen variations on this dessert using any kind of fat imaginable,
ranging from cooking fat to olive oil or butter, though I've only tried it
with olive oil.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15-20 minutes.
: Precision:  Measure the ingredients, except for the sugar which you can
adjust to taste.

Haman's Ears

deserts, holiday, italian

2  eggs
2  egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar salt
1 teaspoon lemon rind; grated
3 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon rum or brandy
2 1/2 cup flour, unbleached
1 cup oil; olive or otherwise for fr

Orecchi di Aman For the Italian Jews orecchi di Aman are as
synonymous with the festival of Purim as the Hamantaschen are for the
Ashkenazim.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs, egg yolks with the sugar, lemon rind,
olive oil, vanilla extract and rum. Gradually add enough flour to
make a rather soft dough. Turn out onto a floured working surface and
knead for 2 or 3 minutes. Roll very thin. With a pastry cutter or
sharp knife, cut into strips 1 inch x 4 to 7 inches. Slowly heat the
oil in a small saucepan. (Oil is at the right temperature when a
small piece of dough drops into it floats and begins to sizzle.) Fry
a few strips at a time, twirling them to give them odd shapes until
they are lightly golden. (Tie the longer pieces into a knot before
frying them.) Drain and place on a paper towel. When all the ears are
done, transfer to a large serving dish, sprinkling each layer with
confectioner's sugar (through a sieve). YIELDS: 2 to 3 dozen

Hans Peachy Crepes With Marinated Peaches

deserts

1 cup all-purpose flour
3  egg yolks
3  egg whites
2 tablespoon melted butter (unsalted)
1 pinch of salt
1 cup milk
1/2 cup water

*Beat egg whites until they reach a peak. Store in refrigerator. In
mixing bowl blend flour, egg yolks, salt, milk and water. Cover
mixture with damp cloth, let rest for two hours. Then, blend mixture
with egg whites and melted butter. Over medium high heat bring
buttered six-inch pan to sizzle. Ladle a little batter into frying
pan. Tilt and rotate so batter covers surface evenly. Pour any excess
batter back into bowl. Fry crepes lightly until brown on both sides.
For immediate use, cover crepes with foil and keep warm in low oven.
Or place crepes on plate, separate each crepe with a piece of
waxpaper. Cover all with plastic wrap and store in refrigerator.
Makes 15 crepes.

NOTE: For sweet crepes add 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of
sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla sugar.

*Wash peaches, air dry, cut into bite-size pieces, remove pit.
Sprinkle with sugar, add orange juice, toss lightly. Squeeze lemon
juice over all, cover with plastic wrap and rest overnight at room
temperature. Just before serving, heat peach mixture in skillet.
Reheat crepes in dry pan over medium low heat. Place crepe on dessert
plate, ladle marinated peaches on one side of crepe topped with 2
tablespoons of ice cream (preferably a good quality french vanilla).
Serve immediately. For extra flavor, marinate peaches in 1/2 cup

Hard Candy

candy

      ----STIR TOGETHER BEFORE HEATING---
2 cup cane sugar
2/3 cup light karo
3/4 cup water
1 teaspoon oil flavor* & color
1 teaspoon or more citric acid**

Have color/flavor/citric acid ready when finished cooking! *More or
less, some flavors are stronger than others. **Put citric acid in
fruit-flavored candies for tartness. TEST YOUR THERMOMETER EVERY DAY!
To test: Place it in cold water & bring to boil. If water boils at-
say 210 instead of 212, reduce cooking time 2 degrees. ***I use a
TAYLOR thermometer. Wilton sells them now. Spray *PAM in molds & on
surface. Not too much & only once per session. USE A THIN PAN, NOT
HEAVY! Candy must set a few minutes in the pan & the temp will rise,
burning the candy in a thick pan. Bring mixture to boil. Put lid on
for 3 minutes <to wash down sugar crystals>, add thermometer & DON'T
STIR. When therm. reaches 285-290D. remove pot from stove.Wait for
temp. to lower below 260^ before adding color/flavor/citric acid.
<Will cook flavor out if too hot.> Cover pan after adding citric acid
so it won't fade the taste. I add about 2 ts citric acid.
DON'T STIR!  Use the tiny viles of Lorann oils. Avail. in cake
supply shop or drug store.
I pour the cooked candy into a GUTTMAN candy funnel <holds entire
recipe.> Thats the quickest way to get it in molds befor it cools &
hardens. *Of course, spray funnel! I pour some into molds & the rest
onto my marble slab. The part on the slab: I roll it into a long
cylinder & cut into "pillows" w/scissors. Dust finished candies with
powdered sugar so they won't "melt" together. There is one very nice
sucker mold. It is a white ring w/ a slit for the stick. <Don't spray
stick.> All you do is spray mold, add stick, fill w/candy, cool &
remove easily Comes in 2-3 sizes, round or heart-shaped. I beleive it
is Guttman Brand & available here at Sugarcraft. About 2 dz in a
pack. This is my kids favorite Christmas candy. You will want to make
several flavors. Experiment on how-much flavor. All vary. *Don't add
too much on the mints. Takes more on the
cherry/strawberry/lemon/orange, etc. There are at least 50 oil
flavors available to choose from! Shared by Dolores McCann, Hamilton

Hardee's Cinnamon "Flake" Biscuits

biscuits, breads, deserts

1  van geffen vghc42a
1  mixture
1  box kellogg's bran flakes --
1  (1 ounce) (1-serving
1  size)
1 tablespoon cinnamon
2 tablespoon brown sugar -- packed
2 tablespoon butter -- melted
1  biscuit dough
2 1/2 cup bisquick
2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup dark raisins
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup tonic water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

MIXTURE-Empty the box of cereal into blender. Dump in cinnamon and
brown sugar and use high speed, on/off, for about 3 seconds or till
crumbled, but not powdered. Empty into small bowl. Stir in melted
butter with fork till mixture is completely softened. Set aside.
BISCUIT DOUGH-Use a 2-qt mixing bowl. Stir biscuick together with
sugar and raisins. Putbuttermilk, Tonic water and vanilla into
measuring cup, without stirring and pour into Bisquick mixture. Use
fork to mix until all of the liquid is absorbed. Then knead in the
bowl with hands, dipping into additional Bisquick, to make dough
smooth and no longer stick. Break dough up into 4 or 5 portions in
the bowl - sprinkling the "Flake" mixture over the dough and then
working it into your hands till most of it is pretty well evenly
distributed throughout the dough. You want more to "marbelize" the
dough than you do "mix"it into it. Divide dough into 12 equal parts
and shape each into 1/2" thick patty, arranging close togethe r in
Pam-sprayed 12" rouond or oven-proof skillet (or use 2 8" round layer
cake pans). Bake at 400~ for 25 minutes or until evenly golden.
Remove pan to wire rack and wipe tops with icing at once using the
following recipe. ICING-In small bowl with electric mixer on high
speed, beat 2 tb melted butter, 1 ts vanilla, 2 tb sour cream, dash
of salt and 1-1/2 c powdered sugar until smooth.Place a rounded tb of
icing atop each biscuit right out of the oven. The heat of the
biscuit will soften the icing just enough that you can swirl it
around to coat the tops nicely, letting the icing stand on thewarm
biscuits half a minute before spreading it. Refrigerate any leftover
icing in covered container to use within 2 weeks or freeze to use in
6 months.

Hazelnut Biscotti

deserts

1 cup hazelnuts (about 4 oz)
1/4 lb butter, unsalted, room temp
1 cup sugar
1 large lemon, grated zest of
2  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cup all purpose flour,
1  plus 2 tbsp
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

I just made this recipe once, and I substituted toasted sliced
almonds for the hazelnuts. It was really good. Preheat oven to 350-F.
Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for 8 to
10 minutes, until fragrant. Place the nuts in a dish towel and rub
them together to remove some of the skin. Coarsely chop the hazelnuts
and set aside. In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer,
beat the butter at medium speed until soft and creamy. Add the sugar
and lemon zest and beat until the mixture is very light and fluffy,
about 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then beat in
the vanilla. In a medium bowl, toss the flour, baking powder and
salt. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter, beating on low
speed until a smooth dough forms. Using a wooden spoon, work in the
hazelnuts until evenly distributed. Divide the dough in half in the
bowl. With lightly floured hands, form the dough into two 10-by-2
inch rectangular logs. Place the logs on an ungreased baking sheet,
at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the logs are
set and golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking
sheet for 15 minutes. Using a serrated knife and a sawing motion,
carefully cut the logs into 1/2-inch diagonal slices. discard the end
pieces. Arrange the slices, cut sides down and close together, on 2
baking sheets. Bake the biscotti on the top and middle racks of the
oven for 8 to 9 minutes, or until lightly browned. Turn the biscotti
over, switch the position of the baking sheets and continue baking
until lightly browned on the other side, about 9 minutes longer. Let
the biscotti cool completely on the baking sheets.

Hazelnut Cherry Tart

deserts

      ----PASTRY----
1/2 cup plain flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 oz hazelnuts, roasted ground
2 tablespoon sugar
2 oz butter
1  egg yolk
2 teaspoon water
      ----CUSTARD FILLING----
4  egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cup cream
3 teaspoon gelatine
2 tablespoon water
      ----TOPPING----
2 lb cherries, canned
2 teaspoon gelatine
2 teaspoon rum (see note)

MAKE PASTRY:  Sift flour and add all dry ingredients together, with the
sugar in the centre, on a pastry board. Add the butter (softened), egg yolk
and water. Work the liquids into the sugar, until it is creamy.

Now work in the flour mixture, as you would for any sweet pastry. Press the
dough into a greased 9-inch flan tin. Prick the base of the pastry all
over. Refrigerate for 30 mins, then cook in a moderate oven (375 degrees
F.) for 15 to 20 mins (until golden brown)

MAKE FILLING:  Put egg yolks, sugar and vanilla into a bowl and beat until
thick and creamy.  Heat cream carefully until almost boiling.

Combine the two mixtures, beating until smooth, then add the result to the
top of a double boiler and simmer until it thickens (STIR CONSTANTLY).

Dissolve the gelatine in the water and add to the cream mixture, stirring
well until it is well mixed. Allow this mixture to cool completely before
adding to the pastry case. Refrigerate until it sets.

MAKE TOPPING:  Drain the cherries and reserve about 1 cup of the syrup. We
don't use commercial canned cherries.  I would suggest a "light" syrup.
Arrange the pitted cherries artistically over the top of the tart.

Put the reserved syrup, gelatine and rum (we usually use cherry brandy or
kirsch) into a saucepan and heat (stirring) until gelatine dissolves. Cool
the liquid and pour over the cherries.  Refrigerate until set.

NOTES:

*  A thoroughly decadent desert -- This has simply got to be the best
dessert you'll ever try. My wife has made this one many times. The only
complaint ever lodged is that there was not enough.

*  Don't be put off by the complexity of the recipe; it is well worth the
effort.

*  All the egg whites "wasted" can be used in something else, such as a
Pavlova.

: Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
: Time:  several hours preparation, cooking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients carefully.

Hazelnut Succes

deserts

5 oz hazelnuts  lightly toasted & skinne; d
1 cup confectioners' sugar
6  egg whites; room temperature
1 pinch cream of tartar
1 cup granulated sugar
      ----HAZELNUT PRALINE BUTTERCREAM---
3/4 cup granulated sugar water
5  egg yolks
1  egg; (whole)
3/4 lb unsalted butter  softened & lightly; beaten
1 2/3 cup hazelnut praline; (below)
      ----HAZELNUT PRALINE----
5 oz hazelnuts  lightly toasted & skinne; d
1 1/4 cup granulated sugar water

Preheat the oven to 250 F.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment
paper and trace a 10-inch circle onto each piece of parchment. Finely
grate the toasted hazelnuts (a rotary nut grater works best) into a
bowl. Sift in 3/4 cup of the confectioners' sugar and toss to mix
thoroughly.

In a large bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on low speed
until foamy, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to high and beat
until the whites nearly double in volume and stiff peaks form.
Gradually beat in the granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat
until the whites are dense and glossy and form stiff peaks. With a
large rubber spatula, lightly fold in the nut mixture until no white
streaks remain.

Use a tiny amount of the nut meringue to anchor the corners of the
parchment to the baking sheet. Spoon half of the meringue onto one of
the circles and, with a thin metal spatula, spread into an even layer
to fill the circle.  Form a second circle with the remaining meringue
on the other baking sheet.

Bake the nut mixture in the upper and lower thirds of the oven,
switching positions once, until lightly browned and crisp throughout
when tapped, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. The amount of time it takes to dry out
will depend on the humidity of the day.  Let cool to room
temperature. (The recipe can be prepared to this point up to 2 days
ahead.) Wrap the meringue layers, with the parchment still attached
to the bottom (for stability), in a large sheet of foil to seal.

TO ASSEMBLE THE DESSERT:  Peel off the parchment paper from the
meringue layers.  Set one layer on a flat surface and spread evenly
with 2 cups of the (room temperature) Hazelnut Praline Buttercream.
Place the second layer, flat-side up, on top of the buttercream and
press gently. With a metal spatula, spread the remaining buttercream
evenly on the top and sides of the cake.

To decorate, press the Hazelnut Praline around the sides of the cake
and sift the remaining 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar evenly over the
top or use stencils to create a design. Garnish with the whole
hazelnuts. Refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour, or up to 24
hours to firm up. Serve chilled.

HAZELNUT PRALINE BUTTERCREAM: In a small heavy saucepan, combine the
sugar with the water.  Bring to a boil over moderately high heat,
stirring to dissolve the sugar. Boil without stirring until the syrup
reaches the soft-ball stage, 244 degrees F on a candy thermometer,
about 6 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the egg yolks and whole egg on high speed
until pale, fluffy and quadrupled in volume, about 5 minutes.

Gradually beat the boiling syrup into the eggs in a thin steady
stream. Beat until the mixture cools to room temperature, 6 to 8
minutes.

Gradually beat in the butter, 4 tablespoons at a time, and continue
to beat until the buttercream is fluffy.

Fold in the Hazelnut Praline.  Use at once or cover and refrigerate
overnight.  Remove from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before
using, to return to room temperature. (Makes about 3-2/3 cups)

HAZELNUT PRALINE:  Lightly oil a baking sheet and place the nuts in a
single-layer in the middle of the tray.

In a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar with the water. Bring to a
boil over moderately high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Boil
without stirring until the sugar turns golden, about 10 minutes.

Drizzle the boiling caramel over the nuts and set aside until hard and
cool, about 20 minutes.

Break the nuts and caramel into chunks by hitting the bottom of the
tray. Grind to a powder in a food processor, about 20 seconds. Use at
once or store in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks. (Makes about
2-1/4    cups)

High-Summer Pudding

deserts, low cal

1/4 cup cranberry or cran-raspberry juice c; ocktail
2 1/2 tablespoon blackberry brandy or kirsch (cherry; brandy)
1  or orange juice
1  envelope plus 1 1/2 tsp unflavored; gelatin
1 lb red or black plums, pitted and chop; ped (5-6 medium)
1 cup sugar
1 1/4 lb fresh peaches, peeled, pitted and c; hopped (4-5 medium)
2 1/2 cup fresh blackberries or black or red; raspberries
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
15 slice thin-sliced homemade-style white br; ead (such as

Pepperidge Farm), crusts removed

Line a 2-quart bowl or mold with plastic wrap, carefully smoothing
the wrap onto the bottom and sides so that the plastic hangs 1 inch
over sides. In a small bowl, mix cranberry juice and brandy, kirsch
or orange juice and sprinkle gelatin over the surface; let stand 5
minutes until softened.

Combine plums, sugar and gelatin mixture in a medium-sized saucepan.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring for 3-4 minutes until
the gelatin dissolves.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 7 minutes.
Add peaches and simmer for about 5 minutes longer, until the peaches
are almost tender. Stir in blackberries, lemon zest and cinnamon and
simmer 3-4 minutes longer, until the berries begin to release their
juice. Refrigerate.

Arrange bread slices in the bottom of the bowl or mold, cutting as
needed and fitting them tightly together. Arrange more slices all
around the sides of the dish, fitting them together tightly and
smoothly. Taking care not to dislodge the bread, spoon the fruit
mixture into the center of the dish, tilting the dish to distribute
the fruit evenly. If the bread extends more than 1/4 inch above the
layer of fruit, trim it with a knife. Cover the fruit with another
layer of bread, patting it down firmly. Stack several saucers or
small plates on the bread to weight down the pudding. Refrigerate for
at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.

To serve:  Invert the bowl over a serving plate, tugging the
overhanging plastic wrap to loosen the pudding from the dish. Center
the pudding on the serving plate and peel off the plastic wrap.
Serve immediately, cut into wedges.  Serves 6.

Hints For Using A Candy Thermometer

candy

      ----CANDY CLASS, SUGARCRAFT----

...Learn all the secrets of really GREAT candy making! *The first
thing that should be done each day, before you start, is to TEST YOUR
THERMOMETER! To do: immerse therm. in cold water. Bring to a boil.
At sea level water boils at 212 degrees <on a sunny day.> If your
water boils at 210 degrees, you should reduce the cooking time by 2
degrees. Most of the time, water boils here about 208 d. Try not to
cook candies on a rainy day. The barometric pressure, when the air is
heavy, holds the mercury in your thermometer down. "Make candy when
the sun shines," motto of a good candy maker. *I recommend a TAYLOR
or WILTON thermometer. Use a thin (good quality) pan for candies that
MUST STAY IN THE PAN for any length of time for cooling. If you leave
the thermometer in the pan, you may notice the temp. rising even
after the candy is removed fro the stove. Using a heavy pan, your
candy will burn, in this case. Use a HEAVY PAN for fudges, fondants,
etc., that are to be dumped immediately. Dolores McCann, OH-- teacher.

Hippo Pot De Mousse

mousses

4 oz semisweet chocolate
2 oz bittersweet chocolate
2 cup heavy cream, well-chilled (whipping; cream will do nicely)
1 teaspoon almond extract (optional)

Melt the chocolate together in the top of a double boiler. Be careful
to do this slowly, so as not to burn the chocolate, and to keep all
moisture away from the pot. Let the chocolate cool for five minutes.

While the chocolate cools, whip the cream and almond extract together
until very stiff.  Gently fold the cooled chocolate into the whipped
cream. There will be many flecks of chocolate in the mixture.

If you're not going to eat it all yourself, spoon into six large wine
glasses. Chill one hour.

NOTES:

*  Extremely quick and easy chocolate mousse -- This is an adaptation
of a very easy chocolate mousse recipe from Sandra Boynton's
hilarious book, "Chocolate, the Consuming Passion."  It requires none
of the laborious preparation that most French mousse recipes call
for, and really optimizes the effort needed to consume the chocolate,
which is, after all, what this is all about. Yield: Serves one to six
people.

*  If you're careful, you can also melt the chocolate in a microwave
oven, in its wrapper. If you try this, be especially mindful of the
semisweet chocolate, as the sugar therein caramelizes very quickly,
leading to an awful mess (and ruined chocolate).

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour chilling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

1 lb round steak, cut in strips 4 x1/8; thick
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon worchestshire sauce
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
3/4 teaspoon hot sauce
1/2 teaspoon hickory salt

Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time: 8 hrs Slice
round steak, cut in strips about 4 in. long and 1/8 in. thick. (The
slicing is easier if the steak is partially frozen.) Combine all the
ingredients and marinate in the fridge for at least 8 hrs, mixing
occasionally. Then skewer the marinated strips on bamboo skewers or
toothpicks and hang the strips in the oven with a pan below to catch
the drippings. Set the oven on it's lowest setting (l00-150 F) and
use something to keep the door ajar. The jerky should be dry after
8-10 hours. This was my first time making j erky and the product come
out surprizingly good, but perhaps a bit too salty. You might want to
try low salt soy .

Home-Candied Angelica

candy

1 lb angelica
1 lb granulated sugar

The most important thing about candying angelica is to choose stalks
that are young and tender.  In other words, angelica is only worth
candying in April or May when the shoots are new and softly coloured.
Trim the young shoots into 3-4 inch lengths, put them into a pan,
cover with water and bring to a boil.  Drain and scrape away tough
skin and fibrous threads with a potato peeler, rather as you might
prepare celery. Return the angelica to the pan, pour on fresh boiling
water and cook until green and tender. If the shoots are as youthful
as they should be, this will take 5 minutes or less.  Drain the
stalks and dry them.  Put them into a bowl and sprinkle granulated
sugar between layers, allowing 1 pound of sugar for every 1 pound of
angelica. Cover and leave for 2 to 3 days. Slide contents of the bowl
into a heavy-based pan.  Bring very slowly to the boil and simmer
until the angelica feels perfectly tender and looks clear. Drain,
then roll or toss the shoots on greaseproof paper thickly strewn with
sugar, letting the angelica take up as much sugar as will stick to
it. Then dry off the angelica - without letting it become hard - in
the oven, using the lowest possible temperature.  I place the stalks
directly on the oven shelves (with trays underneath to catch any
falling sugar) and find they need about 3 hours.  Wrap and store
after cooling completely. Packed into pretty little boxes,
home-candied angelica makes a charming present.

Homemade "Everything In It" Granola

deserts, holiday

5 cup rolled (not instant) oats
1 cup raw wheat germ; (available at natural-foo
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
1 cup honey or brown sugar
2 cup coarsely chopped pecans
1 cup powdered milk; (1  3.2-ounce envelope)
1/2 cup sesame seeds
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoon salt
1 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup water
1 cup dried apricots; coarsely cho
1 cup dried apples; coarsely chopp
1 cup dried prunes or dates; pitted and chopped
1 cup dark raisins

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Combine all, or as many of these
ingredients as you can put together, in a huge bowl. You will
probably have use your hands to turn the mixture over until it is
thoroughly combined. Divide between 2 jelly-roll pans and toast in
the preheated oven for 1 hour. Stir the ingredients well every 15
minutes, turning them over to be sure that nothing burns on the
bottom. Remove the pans from the oven and allow the mixture to stand
for about 1 hour until it has cooled completely. Pack into apothecary
jars, old-fashioned candy jars, or other airtight containers. It
keeps indefinitely---or at least 8 weeks, which is quite a long time.

Honey Nut Rolls ( Bourekakia)

deserts

      ----FILLING----
2 cup chopped nuts (or more) *
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1  orange (grated rind only)
1/2 lb commercial filo sheets
1/2 lb sweet butter; melted
      ----SYRUP----
2 cup honey
1 cup water
2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice

*Note: Nuts may be walnuts, almonds, pecans, pistachios or any
combination. Defrost filo to room temperature at least 2 hours before
using. Mix filling in a bowl and set aside. Melt butter in a small
pan, and return to heat when it cools and doesn't flow easily while
you are working with filo. Smooth 3 sheets of filo flat on a cutting
board.  With a pastry brush, dribble warm butter between sheets.
Sprinkle 2/3 cup of nut filling over top, spreading to corners. Lay
another 3 sheets of filo over filling, buttering between them.  Fold
edges over on each side to keep nuts from rolling out.  Starting with
the end nearest to you, roll away from you as tightly as you can. Cut
into 1" slices. Place each roll in oiled pan, next to each other,
snugly, nuts facing upwards. Continue using all the filo and filling.
When all the slices are in the pan, dribble a teaspoon of warm butter
on top of each slice.  It will disappear into the layers of nutmeats.
Bake at 350 F for 45 minutes. Begin making syrup 20 minutes before
the pastry is ready to be taken out of the oven. Pour hot syrup over
rolls immediately upon removal from oven. Use a spoon to ladle it
over each one.  Set aside to absorb syrup for 4 hours.  Do not
refrigerate.

Honey Orange Biscotti Lf

deserts

2 cup flour
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon dried grated orange rind
1/3 cup chopped pecans or currants (optiona; l)
1/4 cup fat-free egg substitute plus
2 tablespoon fat-free egg substitute
1  (can use egg whites)
2 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoon frozen orange juice concen trate, t; hawed

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and
orange rind and stir to mix well. Add the pecans or currants if
desired and stir to mix. Add the remaining ingredients and stir just
until the dough holds together.

2. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape into two 8
x 2 inch logs. (If the dough is too sticky to handle, knead in a
little more flour.) Flatten out the logs a little bit or else the
crust will split and crack. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking
spray and place the logs on the sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for
about 23 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer the logs to a
wire rack and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

3. Place the logs on a cutting board and use a serrated knife to
slice the logs diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place the
slices on a baking sheet and bake at 300 degrees F for 20 minutes or
until lightly browned, turning after 10 minutes.

4. Transfer the biscotti to wire racks and cool completely. Serve
immediately or store in an airtight container.

NOTE: These are very easy to make and taste great. I made them
without the pecans or currants, so there were even less fat and
calories.

Horehound Drops

candy

1  karen mintzias
1 cup fresh horehound leaves
1 cup water
2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon corn syrup or honey

Put the horehound in a small nonreactive sauce pan and add the water.
Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, or 20 minutes. Allow to cool,
then remove horehound and squeeze out all the liquid. Add the sugar
and corn syrup or honey to the pan, stir with a wooden spoon while
bringing to a boil, then turn heat down to a gentle simmer. If
bubbles threaten to overflow the pan, reduce heat slightly and stir.

Boil to the hard-crack stage.  If you have a candy thermometer, this
is in the range of 330 F, but even so you'll need to test often
toward the end of cooking to get the hardness right. Keep a shallow
cup of cold water nearby. Stir the liquid occasionally, and watch how
it falls from the spoon. When it forms a thread, begin testing for
hardness by allowing a drop of the mixture to fall into the cup of
cold water.  Don't trust your fingers to examine the now-hardened
drop in the cup; bite it. If it's at all gooey or sticks to your
teeth, keep cooking. When it's hard enough to crack when you bite it,
remove the pan from heat immediately.

If the mixture crystallizes, just add a cup of water and an extra
tablespoon of corn syrup or honey to the pan, scrape all the
crystalline chunks into it, and begin again.

Lightly butter a candy mold, cookie sheet, or other heatproof baking
pan, and pour in the hot mixture.  If you're using a flat-bottomed
pan, score the surface of the candy after it has cooled enough to
become firm. This will help in breaking it apart, which should be
done as soon as the candy can be handled.

After individual "drops" are formed, sift granulated sugar or powdered
sugar over them to keep them from sticking together. Store in a
moisture-proof container.

Hot Gooseberry Souffle

deserts

1/4 cup gooseberry puree, thick and sweeten; ed
6 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup flour
1 cup milk
3 large eggs, separated

In a heavy pan, melt the butter over low heat. As the butte melts,
stir in the flour. Stir until smooth and blended, then gradually add
the milk, stirring all the time so that the mixture remains smooth.
Bring to the boiling point, still stirring, and cook for three
minutes. Add the gooseberry puree and stir until thoroughly mixed.

Beat the egg yolks until they are light and combine them with the
gooseberry mixture. Beat the whites until they are stiff (this means
that you can turn the bowl upside down without any ill effect), and
use a metal spoon to gently fold the whites into the gooseberry
mixture.

Lightly oil a 5-cup soffle dish. Turn the mixture into the souffle
dish and bake on the middle shelf of a preheated 375-degreeF oven for
about 45 minutes. By this time the souffle should be crisp on the
outside and still creamy on the inside. (For a more creamy result,
bake the soffle in a water bath: Stand the souffle dish in a pan and
pour enough hot water into the pan to cover the sides of the dish by
about 2 inches.)

Remember that the souffle will not remain at its best for more than a
few minutes after leaving the oven.

half of boiled cream over egg mixture while beating on low speed.
Then pour egg mixture back into cream and return to stove.  On low

careful not to let it get like an egg scrambled). Remove from Stove.
Strain and chill.

Hrstule

deserts

6  eggs
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon butter
1 1/2 liter cooking oil
1 teaspoon lemon peel bits
1 tablespoon rum
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 lb flour; blended with...
3 teaspoon baking powder

Separate eggs; beat whites until they "peak".  To slightly beaten
eggs, add sugar and cooled, melted butter; blend until smooth. Add
the egg whites, lemon peel, rum and vanilla and blend. Add enough
flour (about 2 pounds) to make a dough that will roll nicely. Roll
out the dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 5/8 x 6 inch strips.

Over quite hot fire, heat the oil until it stops hissing or
"speaking". Use a pan to give you an oil depth of about 2 to 2-1/2
inches. This will allow your hrstule to submerge when you drop it in,
and whenit rises to the surface, it pretty well indicates readiness
to turn. Turn and cook both sides a golden brown color. Coat with
powdered sugar while hot. Twist in various shapes or knot your
hrstule before droppoing into oil.

squash in a single layer. Pour in the water. Bake, covered for 30
minutes. Remove dish from oven, turn squash over and cool. Use a
spoon to remove the flesh. Cut into 2-inch cubes. Place squash in a
bowl, drizzle with brandy, sprinkle with sugar and set aside for 30
minutes to macerate.

In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix in

amaretti cookies. Set aside.

almond mixture evenly over them. Bake for 1 hour, or until the squash
is bubbling and the topping is golden brown. To serve, scoop hot
crisp into individual dessert bowls and drizzle with chilled heavy

Hunza Apricots With Thick Yoghurt

deserts

250 gm hunza apricots
225 gm thick plain yogurt, greek or
1  home made

Hunza apricots are apricots which are dried without preservatives.
They are therefore brown in colour instead of orange. They have a
wonderful flavour and a natural sweetness.

Put apricots into a medium sized saucepan and cover generously with
water. Leave to soak overnight if possible. Then simmer the fruit
over a gentle heat, without lid on the saucepan until fruit is tender
and the has reduced to a syrup.

Serve hot or cold, with the yogurt.
