1/4 pint water
2 oz beef drippings
      ----TOP----
12 oz puff pastry
1 beaten egg for glaze
      ----FILLING----
1 lb minced beef
1 cube beef stock
1 teaspoon salt
1 pepper to taste
1/2 pint water
1 pinch nutmeg
3 tablespoon flour
1 brown food coloring

Roll out puff pastry to 1/4" thickness.

Saute the beef.  Dissolve the stock cube in the water, add to beef.
Season to taste.  Sprinkle with flour and cook till flour is browned
and incorporated well. Adjust seasoning and coloring to taste.

Make pies by putting scoops of about 1/4 cup on the base crust. Egg
glaze around the filling and top with the puff pastry, using the egg
glaze as a "glue" (try not to leave large air pockets). Cut around
the filling, creating individual pies.  Brush the top with more egg
glaze for color and bake at 350 degrees till puffed and browned.

Algerian Couscous

meats, ethnic

1 can cooked chickpeas, drain
3/4 to 1 lb. pkg couscous
2 large onions chopped
1 carrot sliced
1 gr bell pepper, sliced
1  eggplant,sliced, salted &
1  rinsed
1 lb lamb, cut in 2 inch cubes
1 chicken cut up in 8 parts
3 tablespoon oil
1  pimento
4  tomatoes, seeded, chopped
2 teaspoon papriks
1  salt
7 oz fresh string beans or peas
9 oz can artichoke bottoms
1  drained
1 cayenne pepper
4 oz butter

Place couscous in shallow pan with 4 cups water. Swirl and pour off
water immediately in a sieve. Rub couscous well between hands and
drop back into pan, making sure couscous is lump free. Let this dry
while preparing remainders. Fry onions garlic, pepper, carrot and
eggplant with chicken and lamb in oil. Then add chickpeas( if using
dried ones ) and enough water to cover. Add pimento and salt and
pepper to taste,Bring to a boil and fasten colander over kettle to
fit snugly. Spoon couscous into colander and let steam for 45
minutes, then dump couscous back into pan to let dry again. Add
tomatoes, beans or peas and cook another 1/2 hour. Now attach
colander and let couscous steam another 15 minutes. Add artichoke,
canned chickpeas to the stew.  Cook a few minutes longer. Add some
butter to the couscous and place couscous shaped into a cone on a
serving platter. surround by meat and vegetables. Note: this is only
one version of many different types of couscous preparation. It is
thought that the name of this grain comes from the soft rumbling
noise that the couscous makes in a steamer. There is a special
couscous pot but a colander can suffice.

Alheiras De Mirandela

meats

3 lb lean beef*
1 1/2 lb calf meat
1/2 lb chicken
1/2 lb turkey
1/2 lb rabbit
1 1/2 lb day old wheat bread
1/4 lb ham (optional)
4 garlic cloves
4 teaspoon olive oil
2 oz pork drippings**
1  paprika, salt and piripiri to taste
10 feet tripe casing

*    Or lean pork, or a mixture of both, for cost reasons. **
Probably a modern addition, or replacement for suet. You may change
the proportions of chicken/turkey/rabbit - it may be all chicken,
etc., provided the total amount remains the same. You can use
partridge, quail, duck, and so on... Boil the meats together long
enough to make the bones separate from the meat by themselves.
Reserve the resulting broth and set meats aside. In a large bowl
place the thinly sliced bread and add the reserved broth. Cover with
a towel and, as soon as the bread is soft enough, mash it with an
wooden spoon. Add the mashed garlic and ground piripiri, paprika and
a little salt. Add the meats cut in very little pieces. Mix
thoroughly. When everything is completely mixed add the olive oil and
the pork drippings, hot. Fill the casing using a suitable funnel. Tie
each 'alheira' so that it's about 8" long, with the filling
concentrated in the middle section, leaving the ends almost empty.
Smoke for 2 or 3 hours a day, for a week. Tie both ends together
before selling or using - the 'alheira' should be U shaped. A typical
way of serving 'alheiras' is frying them in hot oil, and presenting
them with fried eggs and potato chips. Some add broccoli as a side
dish.

Alma's Recipe For 'possum

meats, game

1/2 cup lime
1 gm water
1 cup salt
1 red pepper pod

Put 1/2 cup lime in about 1 gallon of boiling water and scald
quickly, and pull off hair while hot.  Scrape well--remove feet,
tail, and entrails--like you would a pig.  Cut off ears, remove eyes
and head if desired.  Pour hot water over it and clean thoroughly.

Put one cup salt in sufficient cold water to cover possum, add 1 pod
red pepper and let stand overnight.  In the morning remove salt water
and pour boiling water over it.  Cook in enough boiling water to boil
up over possum but not enough to cover.  Cook until skin can be
pierced with a fork easily, and let stand in water until ready for
baking.

When ready to bake, place possum in pan with skin side up.  Bake in a
moderate oven until crisp and brown.  If fire is too hot, skin will
blister and burn.

Carve possum and surround with potatoes (sliced or quartered) which
have been previously baked.

Anise Molasses Brisket Braised In A Wok

beef, chinese

1 small eggplant
2 lb beef brisket, trimmed of excess fat
2 tablespoon peanut oil
1  onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
6 star anise
3 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 cup dry sherry
2 cup beef broth
3 tablespoon dark molasses
1 salt and pepper, to taste
8 dried black fungus (tree ears)
1  tomato, finely chopped
4  scallions, sliced
1 teaspoon asian sesame oil

Here, beef brisket takes on an Asian flare.  Slices of meat are
braised in an aromatic stock seasoned with star anise, soy sauce,
ginger, garlic, red pepper and dark molasses. As a final step, pureed
eggplant is stirred in, for flavor and thickening.

Pierce the eggplant several times with the tines of a fork. Place in a
preheated 400F oven and roast for 3 minutes, or until shriveled and
soft. Set aside. Slice the brisket against the grain into 1/4-inch
thick slices.

Heat the oil in a large wok or large deep skillet. When it begins to
smoke, add half of the beef and cook, stirring, until browned. Remove
and set aside.

Add remaining beef, and cook, stirring until browned. Remove and set
aside. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, crushed pepper, star anise and
soy sauce to wok and stir-fry for 10 seconds.

Return beef to wok, along with the sherry, broth and molasses. Stir to
blend and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over low beat
for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until the beef is tender.

While beef is cooking, soak fungus in hot water to cover. When
swelled and softened, drain and rinse well; set aside.

Cut the stem end from the cooked eggplant.  Split in half lengthwise
and scoop the flesh into a food processor or blender. Puree.

Add eggplant, drained fungus and tomatoes to beef and cook for 5
minutes longer.  Stir in scallions and drizzle with sesame oil. Serve
with rice, if desired.

Serves 4.

Ardshane House Irish Stew

main dish, meats, irish

4 lb middle neck of lamb, cut in
1 one inch chunks
4 lb potatoes, peeled
10 small onions, sliced
2 oz pearl barley
2 pint beef stock
1 salt and pepper to taste

"That's the basic recipe. You can add a load of sliced carrots and
leeks to make it go further and about 5-6 tsps. of Worchestershire
sauce or regular brown sauce wot you Yanks pour over everything!! If
you like, you could add a half a pint of Guinness to your stock. I
make my stock from the potato peelings, carrot tops, leek ends, and
any other stuff I find lurking in the refrigerator. If you chuck in a
few moldy lamb bones and boil/simmer for several hours, you should
get a damned good stock (strain the liquid or you'll get God knows
what stuck in your teeth!!) You'll need to start with about 5 pints
of liquid. Then bung everything into a ginormous pan, bring to the
boil, and then simmer for about two hours...should taste bloody
orgasmic! Salt and pepper to taste, depending on your level of
drunkeness!!"

Arni Lemonato (Lemon Lamb)

lamb, greek

1 text only

Simple ethnic recipes, unchanged for generations, often have an
authority that the latest food fashions cannot begin to match. The
following Greek lemon lamb dish is a case in point. Faithful to its
frugal origins. this recipe works equally well with cheap cuts like
lamb shanks. breast of lamb or best end of neck. If you do use these
fattier meals, make the dish a day ahead, refrigerate it and remove
the fat that coagulates on top. if anything, the dish gains added
depth of flavour when made ahead and reheated.

Trim skin and ail excess fat from a boned shoulder or leg of lamb.
Squeeze enough lemons to provide 1/3 cup of juice. Open out the meat
and rub both inside and outside surfaces with some of the lemon juice
and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.  On the inside surface of the
meat, sprinkle a teaspoon of dried oregano or 1/2 a tablespoon of
chopped fresh oregano. Roll the meat up and tie securely.

Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pot large enough to take the roll
comfortably and brown the meat on all sides. Turn the heat down to
low and add to the pot the rest of the lemon juice, 2 cloves of
garlic, crushed, and another teaspoon of dried oregano or 1/2
tablespoon of fresh.

Cover the pot and simmer very gently, turning occasionally, for about
2 1/2 hours, till very tender. If you like, add small new potatoes to
the pot about an hour before serving.

To serve, remove the string and slice the meat into the centre of a
heated serving platter.  Surround with potatoes and pour lemony
juices over the meat.

Makes 6 servings.

Aromatic Lamb

meats

1  leg of lamb (about 4 lbs)
3 lb potatoes (about 5 oz each)
1  lemon (may be doubled)
1  honey
1  olive oil
1  butter
1  rosemary, thyme & oregano

Put the leg of lamb into a large roasting pan.  Bruise the leaves of 2 or 3
sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle them over the meat.  Add plenty of pepper
and 1 tablespoon honey.  Rub the mixture into the meat with your hands.
Then rub half a lemon over the joint, squeezing the juice on to the meat as
you do so.  Do not add any salt. Leave to marinate for 4 to 24 hours.
Peel and quarter the potatoes, then arrange them in a single layer
round the lamb.  Squeeze lemon juice over the potatoes -- use at least half
a lemon, or up to one and a half lemons for a strong citrus flavour.
Carefully pour 1/4 pint water into a corner of the roasting pan, then
sprinkle over the potatoes and lamb about 2 tablespoons chopped fresh
rosemary, at least 1 teaspoon each fresh chopped thyme and oregano, and
some salt and pepper.  Drizzle on 1-1/2 teaspoons honey and 1 tablespoon
olive oil, then dot with 1 oz butter. Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 6 for
a further 1 to 1-1/4 hours. The ingredients will become gilded and will
burnish to a rich brown in places. Lift the meat and turn the potatoes
occasionally, and if necessary, add a little boiling water to the pan to
prevent drying out.

Aunt Sadie's Brisket Of Beef

main dish, beef, holidays, jewish

3 large onions*
8 whole allspice
1 salt and pepper
1 garlic powder
1 hungarian paprika
1 5-6 lb beef brisket; sliced thin as paper

The following is my favorite brisket recipe and it really does come
from my Aunt Sadie's kitchen: Remove any excess fat from brisket, but
leave a little on top. Place one half of the onions on bottom of pan.
Season the onions with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder and lots
of Hungarian paprika. Place brisket on top of onions, then other half
of onions and allspice on top of the brisket. Cover and roast in a
300 degree F. oven for 3 hours.
Test your brisket and when it is fork tender, take it out. Let it
cool and then slice it very thin.  Strain juice and either thicken it
with a little cornstarch or serve it au jus. You will have a very
dark brown juice. NOTE: Best when made one day in advance.  Aunt
Sadie almost always served this with savory noodle kugel. I also
serve it with roasted, boiled or mashed potatoes.  Use a good
roasting pan with a lit that fits well or covered with heavy duty
aluminum foil.
Spray pan and inside of lid with Pam.

Australian Meat Pie

beef

1 1/2 lb steak; minced
1 teaspoon soy sauce
2 beef stock cubes
1 salt and pepper
1 1/2 cup water
1 pinch nutmeg
2 tablespoon flour
      ----pie base----
2 cup flour
2/3 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt
      ----pie top----
1 pkg puff pastry; (12 oz. size)
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon water

Recipe by: Bob Wells #326 <wel@EUROCONTROL.DE> Making the filling:
Place meat into the pan, stir over low heat until meat is well
browned. Drain off any surplus fat. Add crumbled stock cubes, water,
salt, pepper and nutmeg, stir until boiling, reduce heat, cover,
simmer gently for 20 min, remove from heat.  Combine extra water and
flour, stir until flour mixture is smooth.  Add flour mixture to
meat, stir until combined. Return to heat, stir until meat boils and
thickens. Add soy sauce (to give brown colour), stir until combined.
Simmer, uncovered, 5 to 10 min; remove from heat allow to become cold.

Making the pie base: Sift flour and salt into basin. Place water and
dripping into saucepan, stir until dripping melts; remove from heat.
Make a well in centre of dry ingredients, add liquid, stir until
combined. (2a. If you're in a hurry, just use premade (bought)
pastry. It works ok, too. -JN)

Turn out onto lightly floured surface, knead lightly. Roll out pastry
to line eight greased pie tins.  [We use "real" aluminium 6 or 8 in
pie casings - JN] Cut excess pastry around sides of pie plates using
a sharp knife.  Fill centres with cold meat filing.

Pie crust: Roll out puff pastry on lightly floured surface, cut out
rounds for top of pies, use a saucer as a guide. Wet edges of base
pastry, and gently press tops into place, trim around edges with a
sharp knife. Brush tops with combined egg-yolk and water.

Cooking: Bake in hot oven 5 minutes or until golden brown, reduce
heat to moderate, cook further 10 min.

Bacon-Wrapped Mushrooms

appetizers, meats

1 lb bacon
1 lb fresh mushrooms, washed
1  toothpicks

1. Cut the mushrooms in half. If it is a very small mushroom, leave it
whole. If it is an oversized mushroom, cut into thirds or fourths.

2. Slice bacon in half (width-wise) at an angle. To do this, hold the
knife perpendicular to the bacon, then turn the knife slightly so
that the knife is now at an angle, then slice the bacon.

3. Take a slice of bacon and wrap it around a mushroom half, overlap
the ends, and poke a toothpick about half-way into the mushroom at
the overlap.

4. Repeat this for each bacon slice and mushroom half.

5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

6. Arrange mushrooms on a drip pan about 1/2-inch apart. Bake for 20
minutes. Serve hot.

NOTES: Depending on how thick the bacon is, you may need more than 1
pound. Also, don't let soak mushrooms in water or they'll absorb too
much water and then they'll shrink and crack.

Baked Peameal Bacon

breads, meats

1 peameal bacon, 1 centre cut piece

"Peameal bacon is a unique Canadian meat, pickled but unsmoked loin
of pork rolled in cornmeal. Usually it is sliced and fried for
breakfast but it excellent baked whole. The cornmeal makes a crisp
exterior and the meat, although quite lean, is particularly juicy,
because of the pickling process. For baking it is important to select
a piece from the centre cut, with a wide band of lean visible on both
ends."

Place in an open roasting pan, fat side up. Bake at 350F degrees for
1- 1/2 hours. Serve hot in generous slices with baked beans if
desired.

Bangin' Bart

vegetables, entree

2 large eggplants, unpeeled, diced
2 large tomatoes, diced
2 large onions, finely chopped
2 tablespoon oil (or clarified butter)
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper

In a large frying pan, saute the onion in the oil until it is
translucent. Add the spices and stir for 1 minute. Add the eggplant
and tomato, stir well and cover. Reduce heat and simmer until
vegetables are mushy (about 1/2 hour).

Remove the lid and continue cooking until most of the liquid
evaporates (about 15 minutes). The finished dish should be thick
enough that you could use it as a dip.

NOTES:

*  Indian eggplant, onion and tomato casserole -- This is an Indian
dish, called Baigan Bartha in Hindi.  We make it a lot and call it
"Bangin' Bart." It is eggplant, onions and tomatoes, but not in the
usual way.

In this recipe, the vegetables are cooked to mush, with only a small

*  I don't make this with any spices but salt and pepper. The genuine
Indian version of the recipe adds various Indian spices; try about 1
t of fresh ginger, about 1/2 t of turmeric, about 1/2 t of cayenne,
and about 1 t of garam masala for a more authentic Indian flavor.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Barbacoa De Cabeza

mexican, beef

1  cabeza, beef head
4  onions
1  3 heads garlic
2 bunch cilantro

corn or flour tortillas

Before you actually get the cabeza (beef head), understand that it
won't look very nice -in fact it will look pretty gruesome.
Therefore, I suggest purchasing the thing the day you cook it.

In the Rio Grande Valley, barbacoa de cabeza is traditionally eaten on
Sunday mornings.

Clean the cabeza, removing eyes, ears, etc.  Discard the tongue.
Leaving it will impart an odd taste to the meat. Wrap the cabeza in a
paper sack, along with onions, garlic, and cilantro. Wrap THAT in
burlap.

Dig a hole 2 feet deep and build a driftwood fire in it. Wait until
the fire goes to coals, then cover them with ashes, followed by the
cabeza, then about 2 inches of dry dirt or sand. Fill up the hole.
Add 6 to 8 inches of dirt or sand over it.  Build a fire on top of
the ground. Use slow-burining wood such as oak or mesquite.

Leave the cabeza in the hole 12 to 18 hours.  For example, if you
begin cooking it at 4:00 p.m., it should be ready by the next
morning. Serve with tortillas.

Serves one vanload.

If you want to try barbacoa de cabeza at homne, try wrapping the
cabeza in foil and bakinng it in an oven or over a charcoal grill.
Using foil in place of the paper bag keeps the cabeza slightly
moister while

Basic Jerky

meats, preserving

1 1/2 lb lean boneless meat
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 teaspoon worcestershire
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke
1 vegetable oil cooking spray

Freeze meat until firm but not hard; then cut into 1/8 to
1/4-inch-thick slices.

In a medium-size glass, stoneware, plastic or stainless steel bowl,
combine soy sauce, Worcestershire, onion powder, pepper, garlic
powder, and liquid smoke.  Stir to dissolve seasonings.  Add meat and
mix until all surfaces are thoroughly coated. Cover tightly and
refrigerate for at least 6 hours or until next day, stirring
occasionally; recover tightly after stirring.

Drying the jerky:  Depending upon the drying method you're using,
evenly coat dehydrator racks or metal racks with cooking spray; if
oven drying, place racks over rimmed baking pans.

Lift meat form bowl, shaking off any excess liquid. Arrange meat
strips close together, but not overlapping, on racks.

Dehydrator drying:  Arrange trays according to manufacturer's
directions and dry at 140-degrees until a piece of jerky cracks, but
does not break, when bent (8 to 10 hours; let jerky cool for 5
minutes before testing).

Pat off any beads of oil from jerky.  Let jerky cool completely on
racks; remove from racks, place in a rigid freezer container, and
freeze for 72 hour.  Then store in airtight, insectproof containers
in a cool, dry place; or freeze or refrigerate.  Makes about 3/4
pound.

Storage time:  Up to 3 weeks at room temperature; up to 4 months in
refrigerator, up to 8 months in freezer.

1/2 teaspoon brown sugar***

2 tablespoon water***
3 tablespoon peanut oil
2 slices ginger; minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup water
2 teaspoon sesame oil

*(Flank steak, top sirloin, or tenderloin), sliced across grain into
thin s **(combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl) ***(combine all
seasoning sauce ingredients in a cup) Thoroughly mix beef with
marinade and marinate for 30 minutes.  Heat wok over highest heat,
when hot, swirl in 2 Tblsp peanut oil.
Add ginger and salt and toss a few seconds.  Add broccoli and
stirfry one minute, then add water, turn heat to med-high, cover, and
steam until crisp tender.
Uncover and turn heat to high, stir frying until water is evaporated.
Remove broccoli and reserve. Reheat same wok (without rinsing) and,
when hot, add remaining peanut oil. Add beef slices and stirfry until
lightly browned but not cooked through.  Do not stirfry too
vigorously or meat will not brown, it is better to press slices
against sides of wok to sear. Add broccoli to wok and toss.  When
hot, stir in seasoning sauce and stir until sauce thickens (it's a
good idea to whisk the sauce in the cup just before you hurl it into
the wok). Turn onto a platter and drizzle sesame oil over the top.
The sugar in the marinade and seasoning sauce acts as a floor
enhancer rather than a sweetener. I hope you enjoy this recipe.

Beef & Onion Stew

main dish, beef, french

1 lb leftover beef (preferably
1 from pot-au-feu, or from
1 roast beef) sliced as thinly
1 as possible
4 tablespoon butter
3 medium yellow onions, sliced thinly
1 and separated into rings
1  flour
1 tablespoon plus, red wine vinegar, to
1  taste
1  stock, pot-au-feu broth, or
1 canned beef broth.
1 small bay leaf
1 sprig fresh thyme, or sub-
1 stitute 1 t dried.
1 tablespoon dijon-type mustard, or to
1  taste
1 fresh bread crumbs
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2  lemon, juice

-MIKE'S KITCHEN-

This recipe is an excellent use for leftover beef. Though there are
several variations possible for a Miroton (mushrooms, tomatoes,
garlic), the predominate flavor is always onions, which are made into
a sharp sauce. Preferably, the leftover beef will be from a
pot-au-few that has been tenderized by long poaching, but roast beef
can work as well. It will just need more baking time. The following
is my favorite variation for a Miroton:
Make sure the beef is chilled for easy slicing. Then, slice as
thinly as possible. Set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter
and lightly saute the onions. When golden and very soft, about 10
minutes, sprinkle them with enough flour to make a light roux. Stir
the mixture thoroughly for 2 - 3 minutes before adding the vinegar
and mustard. Continue stirring, adding enough stock or Pot-au-Feu
broth to make a thin sauce. Add the spices. Bring the sauce to a
boil, then lower heat and simmer for about 30 minutes.
Assembly: Pour a layer of sauce into a shallow baking dish.
Layer meat slices, always overlapping, alternating with more of the
sauce. You should end up with a final layer of sauce. Bake, covered,
in a 350 degree oven for half an hour, if meat was originally
poached, or for an hour, if roast beef. Check to make sure sauce does
not reduce too much. Add more stock if necessary.
When preliminary cooking is finished, sprinkle surface of dish
with a thick coating of fresh bread crumbs. Spoon just enough butter
over crumbs to moisten them. Return to oven for about 30 more
minutes, or until a golden crust forms. Sprinkle the top with the
parsley to garnish, and squeeze over it the juice of half a lemon.
Serve at once.
Variations: Add tomatoes, garlic, and/or mushrooms. Instead of
vinegar, use a little grated horseradish. In place of some of the
stock, use wine. This dish is very flexible. It is also economical,
but it doesn't taste like it!

Beef Chunks Cooked In Coconut Milk

main dish, meats, beef, indonesian

1  3 cube fresh galingal or
1  12 slices dried galingal
2 sticks fresh lemon grass or
2 tablespoon dried sliced lemon grass
6 dried red chillies
1  2 stick cinnamon
14  cloves
4 oz red bell pepper
4 oz shallots or onions
1  1 cube fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic
12 fresh/dried curry leaves or
4 dried bay leaves
8 fresh/dried kaffir lime
1 leaves or a 3 x 1/4 strip
1 of lemon peel
3 pint coconut milk
2 lb stewing beef, cut into 1-2
1  cubes
1 tablespoon salt

If you are using fresh galingal, peel and coursely chop it and set it
aside.  If you are using dried galingal, combine it in a cut with 4
tablespoons of water. If you are using fresh lemon grass, cut of the
straw-like top, leaving about 6" of the bottom. lightly crush the very
bottom and set it aside.  If you are using dried lemon grass, put it
into the water along with the galingal. Crumble and break the dried
red chillies and cinnamon into enough water to cobver and add them to
the dried galingal and dried lemon grass if you are using them. Also
put in the cloves. Soak the spices for 30 mins.  Cut the red pepper
coarsely inot dice, discarding all the seeds.  Peel and coarsely chop
the shallots/onions, ginger and garlic. In an electric blender,
combine the soaked spices and their liquid, the frsh galingal (if you
are using it), the chopped red pepper, shallots, ginger and garlic.
Blend until smooth. Into a wide, preferably non-stick pan put the
paste from the blender, the fresh lemon grass (if using), the curry
leaves and kaffir lime leaves (or lemon rind). Stir the coconut milk
well until smooth and pour that in as well. Bring to the boil,
stirring occasionally.  Turn the heat to medium and cook the sauce
for 15 mins, stirring now and then to prevent curdling. Put in the
meat and salt and bring to the boil again. Reduce the heat to medium.
Cook, uncovered for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat up
to medium-high and continue to cook, stirring now and then for a
further 30 mins or until the sauce becomes thick and brown and the
meat tender. This is now called KALIYO DAGING, if you continue to
cook until the sauce dissappears its called RENDANG DAGING.

Beef In Beer

beef

3 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 lb boneless chuck cut into
1 chunks for stew
6 cup sliced onions (1 1/2 lb)
1 salt to taste
1 pepper to taste
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 cup beef stock or bouillon
2 tablespoon brown sugar
2 cup to 3 cup dark beer
1 (microbrew preferred)
1 large herb bouquet *
1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch - blended with
2 tablespoon red wine vinegar

Herb bouquet is 6 parsley springs, one bay leave and 1/2 teaspoon
dried thyme tied in a cheesecloth.

Preheat oven to 325.  Add oil to heavy skillet and heat until almost
smoking.  Brown meat quickly in batches, do not crown the pan. Set
meat aside.

Reduce heat to medium, add onions (add more oil if necessary)and brown
onions lightly for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from pan
and set aside. Season with salt and pepper and then stir in garlic.

Arrange half of the browned meat in dutch oven and season lightly
with salt and pepper.  Spread half of the onions over the beef.
Repeat with the rest of the beef and onions.

Heat the stock in the skillet scrapping up any browned bits stuck to
the bottom.  Stir in the brown sugar and pour over the beef/onion
mixture. Add enough beer so the meat is barely covered. Bury the herb
bouquet in the center of the meat chunks.  Bring the mixture to a
simmer on top of the stove, cover and place in lower third of the
preheated 325 degree oven. Cook at slow simmer for 2 1/2 hours.

Remove herb bouquet. Drain liquid into a saucepan and skim off fat.
Blend cornstarch mixture into the cooking liquid and simmer for 3 to
4 minutes. Taste and correct seasoning. There should be about 2 cups
of sauce. Pour sauce back over the meat.

When ready to serve, cover the casserole and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes
until meat is heated through.

Serve with new potatoes or noodles garnished with parsley.

1 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 1/3 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoon brown sugar
1 lb lean beef
1 liquid mesquite smoke *

Mix all ingredients except beef to make marinade.  Cut thinly sliced
beef into 1/2 inch strips and marinate for 8 to 12 hours. Smoke using
mesquite chips for about three hours and then finish drying in oven.
If doing whole operation in oven use liquid smoke and hang strips of
beef on highest rack and put shallow pan underneath to catch
drippings. Turn oven on and set to lowest possible setting and leave
for 6 to 8 hours until thoroughly dried. A couple of hints that I
picked up from one of the cooking echos. Use toothpicks or wooden
skewers to hang meat by, and put a couple of layers of paper towels
in the pan to collect the drippings and save cleaning problems later
on.

Beef Medallions With Sour Cream Sauce

meats, beef, sauces

2 lb filet of beef
3 tablespoon butter
1/4 lb mushrooms, thin sliced
1 tablespoon shallots, minced
2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
2 tablespoon capers
1 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon dill chopped fresh

1. Trim all fat from beef. Cut the fillets into 12 crosswise pieces of
equal size, about 1/2-in. thick. 2. Melt 2 tbsp of butter in a skillet
large enough to hold the pieces comfortably without crowding. Add the
pieces of filet and cook over moderately high heat about 35-40 sec.
The pieces should be nicely browned on one side. Turn the pieces and
cook about 30-45 sec. on the other side. 3. Immediately transfer the
pieces to a warm serving platter. Add the mushrooms to the skillet
and stir. Add the shallots and cook about 15 sec. Stir in the vinegar
and capers. 4. Add the sour cream and stir well. Let the sauce come
to a simmer. Add any juices that have accumulated around the steak on
the serving platter. Remove the skillet from the heat and swril in
the remaining butter. 5. Pour the sauce over and around the steak and
sprinkle the dill on top.

2 cup soy sauce
1 cup water
1 cup red wine
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon tabasco sauce

Trim all fat from meat.  Slice meat with the grain to about 1/4" to
1/2" thick.  The meat slices nicely when semi-frozen, or your butcher
will slice it for you in his machine. Place meat in the cool marinade
and leave overnight, or for no less than 8 hours.

Remove from brine and allow to air dry without rinsing. Smoke in your
smoker for 12 to 16 hours or until jerky has dried out to your
liking. Use your favorite fuel for smoking.

Beef Pot Pies For Freezing - Consumer's Union

beef

2 lb stew beef
2 tablespoon flour
1 medium onion
1/2 cl garlic (or 1 tsp. garlic
5 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 cup beef bouillon
6 cup water
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 medium potatoes
1 cup carrots
      ----crust----
2 cup flour, sifted
1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup vegetable shortening (not oi
6 tablespoon water

Recipe by: Kenneth Herron <kherron@ms.uky.edu> This recipe was
developed by Consumers' Union for an August 1975 _Consumers' Reports_
report on frozen individual-serve pot pies.  It was the only pie
judged excellent by their taste testers.  This recipe makes eight
pies and can be doubled.

Filling Cut stew beef into 1/2-inch cubes. Dice the onion and mince
the garlic.

Heat oil in a pot large enough to contain all ingredients, including
the water.  While it heats, coat beef with flour. Brown beef a few
pieces at a time, removing each piece as it browns.

Add onion and garlic to pan drippings and cook, stirring occasionally,
until the onion starts to turn transparent.

Add water and bouillon, then all other ingredients except the
vegetables. Cover and heat to boiling. Reduce heat to a slow simmer
and allow to cook around 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

While this cooks, chop potatoes and carrots into 1/4-1/2-inch chunks.
At the end of the simmering time, stir in these ingredients and
simmer 20 minutes more. Add peas and simmer 7 minutes more. Check
beef and vegetables for tenderness and simmer longer if necessary.

Crust

Sift flour and salt into a 4-quart bowl.  Cut in the shortening with a
pastry cutter or two knives until reduced to pieces about the size of
peas.

Sprinkle water over the flour, one tbsp. at a time, and stir in. Stop
when dough is moist but not sticky.

Gather dough into a ball and divide into 8 pieces.

Assembling the pies:

Obtain 8 aluminum foil tart pans (they specify 5 inches in diameter
and 1 1/4 inches tall; this size doesn't seem to be available any
more). Divide the filling evenly among the pans; each pan should end
up not quite full (chunks of food can stick up a bit above the top).

For each pie, roll out a piece of dough between two sheets of wax
paper until it just covers the top of the pan. Peel it out of the
waxed paper, place it on top of the pan, and pinch the crust around
the edges so that it adheres.  Punch a few holes in the center with a
fork and lightly dust with flour.

Place each pan in a freezer bag and freeze.

Cooking a pie:

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Place still-frozen pie(s) on a cookie sheet and bake 40-45 minutes or
until crust is well browned.

Notes:

There's nothing magic about this crust recipe; if you have another
you'd rather use, go ahead.  Personally I'd prefer a bottom crust as
well, but assembling the pies is mind-bogglingly tedious as it is.

For those who have trouble making crusts, the tricky step is cutting
in the shortening.  The intent is to break up the shortening into
small pieces, each coated with flour. Once this is done, handling can
smoosh the pieces together but shouldn't totally disrupt the
shortening/flour structure; it's this layering that makes the crust
flaky.

I find that the beef tends to absorb the oil during the browning
phase and that I have to use extra oil to complete the step, let
alone have any drippings left over. Maybe your average beef is leaner
these days...

I find that the filling isn't always hot in the center after the
baking period, but then we keep the pies in a deep freeze; check this
the first few times by sticking a fork into the center of the pie,
pulling it out, and seeing how hot the tines are.

BEEF STEW~ PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S FAVORITE

meats, beef, stew

4 teaspoon oil
2 each large onions, sliced
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
4 lb lean beef stew meat
1 cup burgundy wine
1 pkg frozen artichoke hearts
2 pkg (8 oz) refrigerated biscuits
1 centiliter garlic, split
1/3 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon dill weed
1 can beef consomme
1 can mushrooms (drained)
1  butter
1 grated parmesan cheese

Heat oil.  Saute garlic and onions.  Remove. Mix flour, salt, pepper.
Dredge meat and brown well. Return onion to pot. Add dill weed, wine,
and consomme. Cover tightly and simmer about 2 hours or until meat is
tender. Cook artichokes 1 minute less than package directions. Add to
meat. Add mushrooms.  Mix gently. Taste for seasoning. Pour into 2
1/2 quart casserole. Crown with biscuits (brush with butter and
parmesan cheese). Bake 15 to 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Note: I
usually cook the stew in the pot, add canned artichokes (not
marinated) with the mushrooms, simmer until the mushrooms are done,
and serve with french bread. Eliminates the frozen artichodes, canned
biscuits, and baking.

BEEF STEW~ PRESSURE COOKED

beef

1 tablespoon shortening
1 lb 1-in cubed stew beef
1 large onion; sliced
1/2 cup water
4 small peeled potatoes
1 pkg frozen peas
1 small carrot; chunked
1 can (15 oz) stewed tomatoes
1 1/2 teaspoon my seasoning (follows)

A VERY QUICK AND EASY STEW RECIPE

Heat the cooker.  Add shortening. Brown the meat.  Add the vegetables,
stewed tomatoes, and water, and place over the meat.

Close the cover securely.  Place pressure regulator on vent pipe and
cook 10-12 minutes with pressure regulator rocking slowly. Cool
cooker at once. If desired, make a paste of 1 tablespoon flour and
1/4 cup of water and stir into stew to thicken.

Another method of preparing stew is to cook the meat separately 8-10
minutes, then add the vegetables and cook 5 more minutes with the
presure regulator rocking slowly.

My Seasoning: 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part
black pepper. Mix well before measuring and adding to the recipe.

Beef Stroganoff

meats

1 1/2 lb round steak or other beef fillet
8 oz mushrooms (canned), sliced
12 oz sour cream
4 oz wine, white
2 tablespoon onion, chopped
2 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 tablespoon chives, chopped
1 teaspoon garlic, minced (or more to taste)
1  salt
1  pepper
1  pasta (or steamed rice)

Cut meat into strips about 1/2-inch thick by 2 inches long.  Saute the
onions in butter until brown. Place meat in pan with onions. Sear quickly
in frying pan along with onion. (This seals the juices inside.) Avoid
overcooking the meat.

Add mushrooms and stir in the wine, chives and garlic for about 5 minutes.
Finally add sour cream, Worcestershire sauce and chives, and simmer until
it almost boils. Serve on noodles or steamed white rice.

NOTES:

*  Sumptuous beef stroganoff -- This easy recipe can be served either on
steamed rice or on noodles.

*  You may want to vary the thickness of the sauce.  I do this by adding
sour cream to thicken, or adding wine to lighten.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 to 45 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Beef Vegetable Soup

soups, beef

1 text only

Wash soup bones.  Put on aluminum lined tray and brown in a 400F oven
until well browned on both sides.  Put bones in soup pot, drain
grease and then get as much of the browned bits as possible using a
little water to help them along.  Add water until the bones are well
covered. Turn on heat. Add carrots, onions, celery, tomatoes
(whatever goes with the soup) some salt and pepper and let simmer
most of the day. Remove bones and chop what meat there is.  Throw out
the vegetables and skim off as much fat as possible (if left in
refrigerator overnight it will come to the top and get hard and can
be removed easily).  Put chopped meat back, add 3 quarts whole
tomatoes (mashed), a couple of cubed potatoes, and about a half
package of frozen mixed vegetables.  Let simmer until potatoes are
done and until needed. The soup is better the next day. Cooked
noodles can be added.

Beef W/Red & Green Peppers Chinese Style

beef, skillet, stir fry, wok

2 medium red bell peppers
2 medium green bell peppers
1 lb lean, tender beef, like
1  fillet of beef or fl. steak
2 tablespoon corn starch
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon red hot pepper flakes
1 cup corn or vegetable oil
1 cup coarsely chopped scallions
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
1 teaspoon sugar or honey
2 tablespoon dry sherry
2 tablespoon chicken broth
1  salt to taste (optional)

Core and remove the seeds from the red and green peppers. Cut peppers into
thin strips, about 1.1/2 inches long. Slice the meat across the grain into
thin strips 1.1/2 to 2 inches long. Place in a bowl and add the
cornstarch, soy sauce and pepper flakes and 2 Tablespoons of the oil. (The
oil keeps the meat from sticking together while cooking) Blend well, and
let stand 15 minutes.

Heat the remaining oil in a wok or skillet large enough to hold the
ingredients. When the oil is very hot add the meat and cook, stirring
about 30 seconds, until separated. Drain the meat in a sieve over a bowl
to catch the drippings and reserve the oil. Wipe out the wok and return 2
Tablespoons of the oil to it. Heat the oil and add the peppers, scallions
and garlic. Cook over high heat until crisp and tender about 1 minute. Add
the sugar, wine, chicken broth, and salt if desired. Add the beef and cook
quickly, stirring, until just heated through. Serve immediately.

BEEF WELLINGTON PT 2

any excess flour from it, and fold the rectangle in thirds as before.
This completes 2 "turns". Chill the dough, wrapped in plastic, for at
least 3 hours and up to 3 days.

Author's Notes: This is a beef Wellington recipe that was in the
recent 50th anniversary issue of Gourmet Magazine. It impressed me
significantly because I rarely get to see a recipe that has both foie
gras and black truffles and looks doable by me. (Your requester in
the digest appears to be on the West Coast, so I'm sure he's got, or
can locate, sources for these delicacies. If he were on the East
Coast, I would recommend he contact D'Artagnan, in Jersey City, at
201-792-0748, for the foie gras and Urbani, in NYC, at 212-941-4710
for the black truffles. By the way, Daguin's daughter, the young lady
who knocked their socks off at the state dinner in Paris for
President Bush awhile ago when she served American foie gras, is
associated with D'Artagnan).

The dough may be frozen.

3. Add broccoli to wok, 1/2 cup water, sugar. Turn burner to medium
high heat, cover broccoli, cook 6 minutes. Lift the cover of the wok
and stir the broccoli every so often so that it will cook on both
sides. At the end of 6 minutes, the broccoli should just be cooked

platter.

NOTE: Pork, or chicken may be substituted, only do not remove pork or
chicken to a platter after initial stir-frying but continue to cook
it with broccoli. Beef is removed for reserve because it toughens
with prolonged cooking.

Beef With Pickled Walnuts

meats

2 1/4 lb stewing steak
1/2 lb ox kidney
4  onions
1 lb carrots
6  pickled walnuts (or more)
2  bay leaves
3 tablespoon beef dripping or olive oil
1 1/2 oz flour
1 pint (scant) light stock

Prepare the meats in the usual way, removing all traces of fat, gristle and
membrane, and cut into large chunks.  Cut the onions into one-eighths.
Scrub or scrape the carrots and cut them into 1/2 to 3/4 inch lengths. Toss
with the meats, onions and carrots in the flour (which should be
well-seasoned) and brown and seal, in batches, in sizzling hot frying pan
barely filmed with dripping or well-flavoured oil. Transfer to a flameproof
casserole.  "Wash out" the frying pan with some of the stock and add it to
the casserole.  Add the rest of the stock, 2 tablespoons juice from the jar
of pickled walnuts and the bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper and
bring to simmering point. Cover and cook at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for
about 3 hours until the meats are very tender and the gravy is deliciously
rich.

Add the quartered or sliced walnuts to the beef.  Check the stew for
seasoning and cook for about 15 minutes more before serving.

Bennigan's Potato Soup

meats, soups

1 garnett pjxg05a
1 3/4 oz ham base -- (2-#40 scoop)
2 quart chicken stock
8 oz yellow onion -- dice
3 oz margarine
2 lb potatoes -- bite size
1 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 cup milk
3 oz flour
3 oz margarine

Combine chicken stock in sauce pan with ham base. Stir until lumps are
gone. In separate stock pot: melt first margarine measurement; add
onion and sautee until transparent. Addpotato bite size pieces and
pepper. Add chicken stock mix and stir until well mixed. Bring
mixture to a boil. In small pan, melt second margarine measure and
add flour to create a roux. It should be light brown in color. When
stock comes to a boil, add roux with a wire whisk. This will cause
the soup to start thickening. Return to a boil. Slowly add the milk.
If the soup is too thin, make additional roux and add it to the soup.
If you need to do this, be sure to cook the roux until a tan color.
This will get rid of the raw flour taste. If the soup is too thick,
thin it out with more milk.

Betti's London Broil

main dish, meats

1 tablespoon melted butter
2 med sliced onions
1/4 teaspoon salt (opt)
2 tablespoon salad oil
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 crushed garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt (opt)
1/2 tablespoon my seasoning (follows)
2 lb scored flank steak

Here is my daughter's favorite recipe.  I have been making London
Broil this way almost as long as I have been married, and that is
over 30 years. Melt butter in skillet. Cook and stir onions and 1/4
tsp salt in the butter until onions are tender. Keep warm over low
heat. Stir together salad oil, lemon juice, garlic, 1/2 tsp salt and
the pepper; brush on top side of meat. Set oven control at broil
and/or 550~ degrees.
Broil meat 2-3 inches from heat about 5 minutes or until brown. Turn
meat; brush with oil mixture and broil just until rare, 5 minutes
longer. Cut meat across grain at a slanted angle into very thin
slices; serve with onions.   NOTE: A can of mushrooms can be added
with the onions. Brisket meat can be substituted for the flank steak.
My Seasoning: 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part
ground black pepper. Mix well before adding to recipe.

Boeuf Bourguignonne

beef

3 lb beef round or rump, 1 dice
1  flour
4 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup salt pork, fine dice
1  salt
1  pepper
4 tablespoon warmed cognac
2  carrots
1  leek
4  shallots
1 large yellow onion
1 clove garlic
1/2 bottle burgundy (or more)
1 stalk celery
1 bouquet garni consisting of:
1 sprig thyme
1 bay leaf
1 sprig parsley
2 tablespoon approx, flour
2 tablespoon approx, butter
12 small boiling onions
1  sugar
4 tablespoon burgundy
12 mushroom caps
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 lemon juice
1 minced parsley for garnish

-MIKE'S KITCHEN-

The tremendous success of this Beef Burgundy depends primaily on three
things: The cut of meat used; The long, slow baking time; The quality
of wine used. The meat needs to be extremely lean and durable enough
to last through several hours of baking. Round or rump is perfect for
the purpose. The long baking time at low temperature brings out the
wonderful richness of the dish. Finally, the choice of wine. To put
it bluntly, a cheap, bad, or wrongly chosen wine will ruin the dish.
Bordeaux wines, though they have the right quality, are too delicate
to add the richness the dish needs. White wines (other than a white
burgundy) are too thin. The best wine is a full, rich French
burgundy, or its California counterpart. Chateauneuf-du-Pape is a
great choice. So is a white burgundy, if the desired result is a less
intense wine flavor. In any event, there are many good French and
California burgundies that would work very well, without costing an
arm and a leg. Just don't use a two dollar bottle of wine, unless you
want a two dollar beef burgundy.

Heat 4T olive oil and 1/2 c butter in a large skillet. Dredge the
meat in flour to coat, and brown in the skillet. Flame with the
warmed cognac. When the flames have gone out, place the meat in an
oven proof pot. Use a slotted spoon.
Saute the diced salt pork until very crisp. Put in the pot with
the meat.
Mince the large onion and the garlic. Slice the carrots, leeks,
and shallots. Add all to the skillet and saute until tender and
browned. Place in the baking pot with the meats. Add salt and fresh
ground pepper. Finally, add enough burgundy to completely immerse the
ingredients, making sure to reserve enough wine to later on cook the
boiling onions (about 4T for six servings). Cover pot and bake in
oven 1 1/2 - 2 hours at 260 to 300 degrees.
At the end of the baking time, skim off any fat; Then, add
about 2T butter and 2T flour. Add the flour slowly to prevent
lumping. Continue baking for about 2 hours longer.
One hour before the dish is done:
Saute until almost tender the boiling onions, in about 1T
butter, with a few pinches of sugar and the remaining 4T or so of the
wine. Reserve and keep warm.
Saute til lightly browned the mushroom caps in the remaining 1T
butter, 1T olive oil, and a little lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon for 6
servings). Reserve and keep warm.
Final assembly: About 1/2 hour before the beef burgundy is done,
gently stir in the boiling onions and the mushroom caps, along with
their collected juices. When the dish is done, garnish with the
minced parsley.
Wonderful with garlic bread and more of the burgundy used in the
recipe.

Boiled Bacon & Cabbage

meats, irish

2 1/2 lb collar of bacon
1 medium-sized cabbage

(NB: in Ireland, "bacon" can mean *any* cut of pork except ham. When
people here want what North Americans call bacon, they ask for
"rashers" or "streaky rashers". As far as I can tell, "collar of
bacon" is a cut from the hock, picnic shoulder, or shoulder butt (I
am here using terms from the diagram in THE JOY OF COOKING). You want
any thick cut of pork, with or without bones, about four inches by
four inches by four or five inches. It does not have to have been
salted first, but if you want to approximate the taste of the real
Irish thing, put it down in brine for a day or two, then (when ready
to cook it) bring to a boil first, boil about 10 minutes, change the
water, and start the recipe from the following point. .

Place the joint in a pot, cover with cold water and bring to the boil,
Remove the scum that floats to the surface. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2
hours (or 30 minutes per pound). Cut cabbage into quarters and add to
pot. Cook gently for about 1/2 hour, or until cabbage is cooked to
your liking. (Test constantly: don't overdo it!) Drain, and serve
with potatoes boiled in their jackets, and a sharp sauce -- mustard
or (if you can get it) HP sauce.

1 cup matignon, from above
1/2 cup flour
2 cup tomatoes, peeled, chopped
8 cup stock, clarified carb/beef
1/2 cup caribou or beef drippings
12 cracked peppercorns
1/4 cup parsley, chopped
      ----BORDELAISE SAUCE----
1/2 cup dry red wine
1 cup espagnole sauce, from above
6 crushed peppercorns
1/4 cup bone marrow, diced.

This is a three step process ( four if you count making the stock in
advance) but well worth it as it makes a superb accompliment to the
finest game or beef steaks and roasts. The Matignon is similar to
Mirepoix. Carrot is traditional in the classic French recipe but
parsnip is more appropriate for game. Melt the bacon fat, mince the
vegetables and add to the pan with the herbs. Cook slowly for 15
minutes until vegetables are soft. Set aside and deglaze pan with the
madeira. Reserve the liquid. Melt in a heavy saucepan the drippings.
Add the Matignon and reheat it. Add the flour, heat and stir until
browned. Then add the pepper, tomatoes, parsley and stir. Add the
stock and simmer gently until liquid reduced by half, about 2-2 1/2
hrs. Stir occasionally and skim fat off the top as it accumulates.
Strain the sauce and stir occasionally as it cools to avoid skimming.
There should be about 6 cups. Set aside 5 cups for other brown sauces
later and take one cup for the last step. In a saucepan, gently
simmer red wine with pepper until reduced to 3/4. Add one cup of
Espagnole and simmer 5 min. Add reserved madeira de-glazing liquid
from step one and the diced marrow and poach it 5 min. Serve with
game or beef chops, steaks, roasted Fillet Mignon, char boiled cuts
and sweetbreads.

Boudin (Sausage Making)

meats, sausage

1 lb hog or beef blood (1pint)
1/2 lb hog fat
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 garlic clove
2  onions

Mince the onions fine and fry them slightly in a small piece of the
hog fat. Add the minced garlic. Hash and mince the remaining fat very
fine and mix it thoroughly with the beef blood. Mix the onions,
spices and herbs. When all mixed take the prepared casings or
entrails and fill with the mixture, being careful to tie the casing
at the further end before attempting to fill. Then tie the other end
making the sausage into strings of about two feet. Wash them
thoroughly on the outside after filling and then tie again in spaces
of about three inches or less in length, being careful not to make
too long. Place them to cook in a pot of tepid water never letting
them boil as that would curdle the blood. Let them remain on the slow
fire till you can prick the sausage with a needle and no blood will
exude. Then take them out, let them dry and cool

Boudins are always fried in boiling lard. Some broil them, however.

Boudin Du Pays (Blood Pudding)

meats

2 cup pork blood salt
2 lb pork, fresh
1  pig's lung
1/2  pig's heart
2  pig necks salt
5  onions; chopped salt & pepper
1  cloves
1  summer savory
1  coriander seeds; crashed to taste
2 tablespoon flour

"Blood pudding is one of the great delicacies of Acadian cuisine. It used
to be that every Acadian family made its own. Since the annual slaughter
came during Advent, the boudin was usually saved for the Christmas
holidays." Also part of Cajun cuisine,

Sauce a boudin: When slaughtering a pig, collect the fresh blood,
immediately add salt and stir to prevent coagulation. Cut the fresh pork,
the lung, heart and neck into large pieces. Place the meat into a large pot
and add just water to cover the meat. Add the salt and 3 chopped onions.
Simmer on medium heat for 3 hours. Remove the meat from the cooking liquid
and let it cool. Cut the meat into very small pieces or grind it with a
meat grinder. Add the meat to the cooking liquid with the 2 remaining
onions, pepper and spices. Bring the liquid to a boil and slowly add the
blood by pouring it through a sieve. Stir constantly. Add the flour, mixed
with a small amounts of water. (The flour may be browned in the oven before
being add to the meat, provided that slightly more flour is used.) Simmer
the mixture on low heat for approximately 1 hour, stirring frequently. This
sauce may served later by warming in a skillet.

Boudin des Branches (Blood Pudding Sausages): To make blood pudding
sausages, prepare blood pudding sauce but do not simmer for the last half
hour. Rather, clean the small intestines of the pig, cut them into 20 inch
pieces at tie them at one end. Using a funnel or a piece of birch bark as
was the Acadian tradition, fill the intestinal lining with the sauce until
the intestine is three quarters full. press out the air and tie the other
end, leaving some space for expansion. Put the branches (sausages) in
boiling water and cook for 45 to 1 hour.

Brigitte's Sauerbraten

meats

2 lb boneless roast beef
1/2 liter buttermilk
1 cup red wine
1  bayleaf
1  onion, sliced
2  cloves
2  peppercorns
5 strips of bacon
1/2 liter water
1 can (small) tomato paste
3 tablespoon cornstarch
2  carrots, sliced

1. Put the meat in a ceramic or glass bowl. Pour the buttermilk,
wine, and bayleaf over the meat. Add the peppercorns and onions. Keep
in the refrigerator for at least 3 days, marinating the meat daily.

2. After 3 days, remove meat from the refrigerator. In a deep Dutch
oven, fry the bacon and set aside. Put meat in the bacon drippings
and brown on all sides quickly. Add 3 Tablespoons of the marinade
(liquid only) and cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the water,
tomato paste, and carrots. Crumble the bacon and add to the meat.

3. Cover and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours, making sure to watch the
level of fluids in the dutch oven. Replace with water if it gets too
low. When the meat is done, remove the meat and the carrots and keep
warm. Stir in the cornstarch to thicken the juices and boil for a
short time to the desired consistency.

4. Slice the meat and serve with the gravy and potato dumplings or
wide noodles (other German choices include boiled potatoes or baked
potatoes) and the carrots.

Brisket Of Beef

main dish, casseroles, beef

3 lb brisket
1 cup stewed tomatoes
1 onion soup mix
2 cup water
6 ginger snap cookies.
1 salt & pepper; to taste

Walt:  I have a great recipe for brisket of beef.  It is easy, makes
its' own great gravy and tastes even better as leftovers. This can be
cooked either in slow cooker or the oven. Either way, put in the
brisket, mix the onion soup with 2 cups of water and pour it over the
meat. Pour the can of stewed tomatoes over the brisket. Place the
cookies in the liquid, not on the meat.  You can break them up to
fit. Seal the pan securely with aluminum foil. (If in a slow cooker
just put on the lid.) Bake at 325 for three hours without peeking !!
Take out the meat, and slice it thinly against the grain and return
it to the pan with the gravy. Reseal and bake at 225 for about one
hour. Make sure all the meat slices are covered by the liquid so the
meat does not dry out. This is tender and delicious. The gravy is
great over rice or wide noodles. FROM: BARBARA ZEGER (BNTH32A)

Rost hym; take redde wyn, poudyr of gynger, poudyr of pepyr & salt, and
bast hit till hit be thorow.  Have a chargeour undyrneth & kepe the
fallyng, and bast hit therwith ayene.  Then take hit of & smyte hit as thu
lyst & serve hit forth.

6 x 1-cm/ 1/2-inch-thick slices venison fillet or haunch Bacon fat or lard
for rubbing Pepper sauce for veal or venison to serve Basting Sauce: 350
ml/12 fl oz/1 1/2 cups red wine 3 tablespoons oil 1/8 teaspoon ground
ginger Salt and black pepper

Venison fillet was the most prized cut.  It might be scored in lozenge
shapes with a knife point or parboiled and larded with salt pork before
being spit-roasted whole.  Modern farmed venison, however, seems to be
tenderised better by being marinated.

Combine all the basting sauce ingredients and soak the venison slices in
the sauce for at least 2-3 hours; elderly meat will need longer. Pour off
the sauce into a jug when you are ready to cook.  Put the meat on a board
and pat it dry, then nick the edges of the slices and rub them all over
with the fat.

Thread the slices on skewers or lay them on a greased grill grid. Heat the
grill to medium-high and grill the meat like steak until medium-rare or
well done, as you wish.  (For well-done meat, reduce the temperature after
searing both sides and cook slowly.)  Baste the meat with the reserved
basting sauce while cooking and turn it once using a fish slice; do not
prod it with a fork.  When done, transfer the slices to a warmed serving
platter, and serve at once, with the hot Pepper Sauce in a sauce boat.

Mix soy, sugar. garlic, oil, and green onions in a mixing bowl. Add

covered and refrigerated.  Heat wok to high. Add a little more oil. Add
meat mixture to the wok and cook at high until the meat is done. Serve over
hot rice.

**I often add vegetables such as onion, green peppers, or broccoli to the
wok after the meat has begun cooking, so they will be cooked yet crisp.

Cajun Lamb With Rice

meats

1  boneless lamb sirloin roast (approx; . 2 lbs)
2 tablespoon cooking oil
1 small onion, chopped
1  red bell pepper, diced
1  green bell pepper, diced
1 lb tomatoes, sliced, in puree
1 1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 cup rice
      ----SPICE MIX----
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

Trim the lamb of any excess fat.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix
together the spice mix ingredients, and rub over the lamb. Let stand for 15
minutes. Heat oil in a skillet. Sear the lamb until all sides are browned.
Remove lamb to a roasting pan. Roast lamb for 35 to 40 minutes.

While the lamb is cooking, add onions and peppers to the skillet used for
searing the lamb.  Saute until soft.  Add tomatoes, chicken stock, basil,
lemon and chili powder.  Bring to a boil and add the rice. Reduce heat and
simmer until liquid is absorbed.

NOTES:

*  This is a spicy lamb dish that I picked up originally from a local
newspaper.  Yield:  serves 2-3.

*  Often when boning a leg of lamb you end up with a very ragged piece of
meat.  Just chop it up into boxy pieces and use more spice mix to cover all
the surfaces.  You will be slicing up the roast before serving anyhow.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  1 hour.
: Precision:  measure the spices.

Calf's Brains With Capers

meats

3  sets calf's brains; prepped
1  flour
2 tablespoon butter
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  paprika
1  rosemary
2 tablespoon capers
1/4 cup dry white wine

Prepare brains;  after skinning them, dry between paper towels.  Cut into
1/2-inch slices and spread on dry towel, then sprinkle with flour on all
sides.  Be sure they are quite dry and not gummy.

When butter is sizzling in the skillet, add the brain slices.  Brown on
each side and sprinkle with salt, pepper, paprika, and a pinch of rosemary.
If the butter becomes absorbed, add a little more so that enough of it
surrounds the slices of brains and becomes slightly brown. Now add capers
with a little of their own juice, then the wine. When everything is
bubbling, serve.

1/2 teaspoon cumin
28 oz tomato, whole peeled
3/4 cup beef stock
4  bay leaf

1. Place chilies in small bowl with boiling water, let stand 1 hour
2. Heat lard or oil in Dutch oven over med. heat until hot. Add 2
lamb shanks. Cook turning often, until brown on all sides about 20
minutes. Remove to plate. Repeat. 3. Place chilies and 1/3 cup of the
soaking liquid in a blender and process until smooth. Discard
remaining soaking liquid. 4. Remove and discard all but 2 TBS oil
from Dutch oven. Add onions and saute' over medium heat about 4 mins.

garlic, oregano and cumin. Add chili puree and cook stirring
constantly for 2 minutes. 5. Add tomatoes, stock and bay leaves to

2 to 2/12 hours/ 6. Remove lamb to serving platter and keep warm.
Skim and discard fat from cooking sauce. Stir in vinegar. Heat sauce

shanks that you clean them as well as possible of as much fat as
possible plus that white membrane. Don't remove all the membrane,
however, as something has to hold them together.

Casserole Of Venison W/ Prunes & Pickled Waln

meats, casseroles, scot/irish

2 tablespoon flour; all-purpose (heaped)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  black pepper to taste
3 lb venison; cut into 1-inch
1  .  cubes
4 tablespoon sunflower oil
3  onions; finely sliced
2 1/2 cup red wine
2 1/2 cup water
1 can pickled walnuts; 15oz, drain
8  prunes; soaked until soft,
1  .  stoned & chopped

The prunes and pickled walnuts provide just the sweet and sharp
contrast that complements the flavour of venison so well.

Put the flour, salt and a good grinding of pepper into a bowl. Toss
the pieces of venison in the seasoned flour to coat. Heat the oil in
a heavy flameproof casserole and brown the meat, a few pieces at a
time; remove the browned meat and keep it warm while you brown the
rest. When all the meat is browned, add the onions to the casserole
and cook them until they are soft and translucent, 5-10 minutes. Stir
in the wine and water, scraping the bits off the bottom of the
casserole with a wooden spoon. When the liquid is simmering. replace
the browned meat in the casserole, and stir in the pickled walnuts
and prunes.
Cover the casserole with a lid, and cook in a preheated moderate
oven (350F / 180C / gas 4) for an hour. Let the casserole cool
completely, then store in the refrigerator overnight. Cook it for a
further hour at the same temperature before serving. All stews and
casseroles benefit in flavour from reheating. "Lady MacDonald's

Catalan Lamb - Garlic Lamb

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  shoulder of lamb
20  cloves garlic, peeled
1  flour
300 ml stock
1 tablespoon tomato puree

This recipe from northern Spain takes only minute of the cook's time
but produces melting lamb in a lush sauce, thick with sweet (and
innocuous) cloves of garlic.

In a wide casserole which can be used on top of the stove, heat a
tablespoon of olive oil and brown a shoulder of lamb on both sides.
remove the meat and add to the saucepan 20 peeled whole cloves of
garlic. Cook gently for a few minutes and sprinkle in a few
tablespoons of flour, stir well, then continuing to stir, add 300 ml
stock mixed with a tablespoon of tomato puree. Return the meat to the
casserole, turn it over in the stock mixture, cover tightly and
simmer very gently until the meat is cooked. Turn the meat over
halfway through cooking and check at intervals, adding more stock if
the sauce is getting dry.

Chang-Chorim (Sp?)

beef, korean

2  scallions
3  cloves garlic
1 cup beef broth
1 cup soy sauce  1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper; dash black pepper

1) Place meat in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to boil,
skimming froth.  Simmer 2 hours. Remove meat from liquid and reduce
to 1 cup (or use canned broth and save this broth for something
else). Cool meat, then slice into pieces approx. 1 1/2 in. x 1 in. 2)
Coarsely chop scallions and smash and chop garlic. Place meat slices
into pan with scallions, garlic, beef stock and soy sauce and bring
to boil. Add cayenne and black pepper. Simmer 5 mins. 3) Remove pan
from heat and cool. Place contents in a container and refrigerate
(the fat will rise to the top and harden and can be easily removed).
This meat will keep indefinitely, but it's pretty tasty, so that's
not a problem with this small amount. I think this is the kind of
thing that is good to have on hand in the fridge to snack on (with
some rice and kimchee, of course) or as part of a simple meal.

Chateaubriand With Artichokes & Barnaise Sauce

beef, french

8 large artichokes
2  beef tenderloin roast; 2 lb each
1 teaspoon salt
1  pepper, cracked black; to taste
1  barnaise sauce

Prepare the artichokes; cut off the stem and cut off two-thirds of the
tops, leaving at least one-inch bottoms. Cook the bottoms; then cool
them slightly, and with a spoon scoop out and discard the fuzzy
"chokes". Return the artichokes to the cooking liquid and keep them
warm.

Prepare coals of grill:  place coals on each side so that the meat is
not directly over medium hot coals. Rub pepper over the beef loins,
then sprinkle with salt. Grill until a meat thermometer registers 145
F. (medium rare).

To serve, with a slotted spoon, remove the artichoke bottoms from the
cooking liquid, and drain them on paper towels.  Spoon some barnaise
sauce into the center of the artichokes. Slice the meat thickly;
arrange the meat on the center of a warm platter and surround with
the stuffed artichokes.

Chef Kimos' Rack Of Lamb

meats

1  rack of lamb
1  garlic; cloves, sliced
1  salt & pepper
1  oil
1  sauce
2 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup mint jelly
2 tablespoon vinegar; i use wine vinegar
1 tablespoon dry mustard

Hi again. This recipe was given to me by a chef friend at the Haiku
Gardens Restaurant in Kaneohe on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. Have
made it often. This restaurant is right out of "RAIN"" by Sommerset
Maugham. It overlooks an awesome valley surrounded by the Koolau
mountains. The royalty, Alii, used the valley as their exclusive
summer hide away from the heat of the other side,leeward side, of the
Island. I lived very near to it and in the Valley for a number of
years. Place slivers of garlic along the bones and the base of the
rack. Salt and pepper all over. Heat small amount of oil in a skillet
to very hot and quickly brown meaty top side of rack only. Don't
allow it to cook or burn. Place rack in a baking dish. While oven is
preheating to 350* to 375*, make sauce. SAUCE: Heat to just below
boiling point while stirring constantly Use to baste rack and as a
sauce to serve with it. I usually doubled the recipe to have enough.
Place baking dish on center rack of preheated oven. Pour 1/2 of the
sauce over rack of lamb. Cook for about 20+ minutes but usually not
more than 25 minutes per pound. Serve and accept the ovations from
family and friends. BTW, this sauce makes a very good barbecue sauce.
That's it, after posting these two recipes for rack of lamb I am out
of here to get one for myself.:):) Really. I will post one last one
later for you Elaine and other lamb lovers. It is nice to be able to
get good lamb all year round now.

Chicken & Sausage Gumbo

meats, poultry, soups, cajun, newspaper

1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 1/4 cup flour
3 lb chicken; cut up
1 cup oil
1 lb andouille or smoked sausage
1  .  cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 cup onion; chopped
1 cup bell pepper; chopped
3 centiliter garlic; finely chopped
1 cup okra; chopped
8 cup chicken stock
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon file
4 cup rice; cooked

Mix 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion
powder; rub on the chicken pieces. Set the chicken pieces aside for 30
minutes.

Place 1/2 cup flour in a bag; add the chicken pieces and shake well to coat
the chicken. Using 1/2 cup of oil, fry the chicken in a heavy skillet until
crust is brown on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken and
drain.

In the same pan, saute the sausage until browned. Remove from the heat,
drain and reserve with the chicken.

Mix 3/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup of oil in a large, heavy-bottom saucepan over
medium heat and stir to mix. Continue cooking and stirring until the roux
is a dark chocolate brown. This can take 30 minutes. Do not cook on too
high of a heat. If it begins to cook too fast, remove from the heat and
continue to stir.

Add chopped vegetables and stir thoroughly. Mixture will be sticky. Cook
for about 5 minutes. (Adding the vegetables stops the browning process.)
Add the chicken stock 1 cup at a time until it is well blended. Add the
remaining seasonings, paprika, file, chicken pieces and sausage. Simmer for
1 1/2 hours. Serve over rice.

Makes about 8 servings.

Chicken Chunks With Peanuts In Spicy Sauce

main dish, meats, poultry, chicken, hot

1/2 cup peanuts; raw
3 cup peanut oil
2 each whole chicken breasts at roo
1 each large egg white
1 1/2 tablespoon water chestnut flour
      ----SAUCE----
4 each green onions
2 each large cloves garlic
1 tablespoon minced ginger root
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
1/2 tablespoon chinese red vingear
1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoon chili paste with garlic
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1 each pinch sugar
1 each cornstarch paste

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++ Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and
white part into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in
2-quart saucepan. Reserve.
Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones.  Slice meat
into 1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks.  In bowl large
enough to hold chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour.  Beat
mixture with a single chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk).  Stir
chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat thoroughly.  Marinate 5
minutes.  Note: water chestnut flour gives a lighter crust than
cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted.
Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat
(you'll need more oil for deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a
light tan color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.
Remove peanuts with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel
or paper bag. Reserve.
Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first:  chicken
should raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes.
Deep-fry coated chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry no more
than 8 chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep
pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove with long chopsticks
or slotted spoon. Reserve. Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat
sauce to simmer.  Add green onions & peanuts about a minute before
serving.  At the last minute, add chicken pieces to sauce, mix
quickly & serve.

Chick-Fil-A Chicken Sandwich

poultry, sandwich

3 cup peanut oil
1  egg
1 cup flour
1 cup milk
2 1/2 tablespoon powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoon salt
2  skinless,boneless chicken>>>
1  breasts-halved
4  plain hamburger buns
2 tablespoon melted butter
8  dill pickle chips/slices

1) Heat oil  in a pressure cooker over med. heat to about 400 F. 2) In
small bowl, beat egg and stir in milk. 3) In separate bowl, combine
dry ingreds.-mix well. 4) Dip each piece of chicken in milk until it
is fully moistened. 5) Roll moistened chicken in flour mixture untill
completely coated. 6) Drop all 4 chicken pcs. into hot oil and close
pressure cooker. When steam starts shooting through the pressure
release, set timer for 3 1/2 min. 7) While chicken is cooking, spread
a coating of melted butter on face of each bun. 8) When chicken is
done, remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Place two pickles on
each bottom bun; add a chicken breast, then the top bun.

Yield: 4 sandwiches

It is very important that oil be hot for this recipe. Test the
temperature by dropping some of the flour coating into the oil. If it
bubbles rapidly, your oil is probably hot enough. It should take abt.
20    min. to heat up.

To make a "deluxe" chicken sandwich, simply add two tomato slices and
a leaf of lettuce. Mayonaise also goes well on this sandwich--it is a
side order at the restaurant.

Recipe by: The Cuisines of Mexico by Diana Kennedy ISBN 0-06-012344-3
This dish consists of large chiles or bell peppers stuffed with meat
or cheese, coated with a light batter, and fried. They are served in
a light tomato broth.

There is alays an exclamation of pleasure and surprise when a cazuela
of golden, puffy chiles rellenos sitting in their tomato broth is
presented at the table. If you have eaten those sad, flabby little
things that usually turn up in so-called Mexican restaurants in the
United States as authentic chiles rellenos, you have a great surprise
in store. Here is yet another prime example of the fine feeling the
Mexicans have for texture in their food: you bite through the
slightly crisp, rich chile poblano to experience the crunch of the
almonds and little bits of crystallized fruits in the pork filling.
Then there is the savory broth to cut the richness of the batter.

Chiles poblanos are imported in great quantities to large centers of
Mexican population here in the States but very few find their way to
the East. (Maybe this was true in 1972 when this book was published,
but these days they are readily available here in Cambridge. To me,
bell peppers are no substitute.) I am afraid the bell pepper is about
the only suitable substitute for appearance and size--you can always
spike them with a little chile serrano.

Assembling the chiles may seem like a long laborious task, but it is
no more complicated and time consuming than most worthwhile dishes,
and this dish is certainly worthwhile.

Prepare the picadillo:

Cut the meat into large cubes. Put them into the pan with the onion,
garlic, and salt and cover with cold water. Bring the meat to a boil,
lower the flame and let it simmer until just tender--about 40 to 45
minutes. Do not overcook. Leave the meat to cool off in the broth.

Strain the meat, reserving the broth, then shred or chop it finely
and set it aside. Let the broth get completely cold and skim off the
fat. Reserve the fat.

Melt the lard and cook the onion and garlic, without browning, until
they are soft.

Add the meat and let it ook until it begins to brown.

Crush the spices roughly and add them, with the rest of the
ingredients to the meat mixture. Cook the mixture a few moments
longer.

Mash the tomatoes a little and add them to the mixture in the pan.
Continue cooking the mixture over a high flame for about 10 minutes,
stirring it from time to time so that it does not stick. It should be
almost dry.

Prepare the tomato broth:

Blend the tomatoes, with the juice extracted from their seeds, with
the onion and garlic until smooth.

Melt the lard and fry the tomato puree over a high flame for about 3
minutes, stirring to prevent sticking. Add the rest of the
ingredients and cook them over a high flame for about 5 minutes,
stirring.

Add the pork broth and continue cooking the broth over a medium flame
for about 15 minutes. By that time it will be well seasoned and
reduced somewhat--but still a broth rather than a thick sauce. Add
salt as necessary.

Chinese Marinated Meat

meats, condiments

      ----MARINADE----
1/4 cup dry sherry (cooking
1  sherry will do)
2 tablespoon light soy sauce
1/4 cup dark soy sauce
2 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/4 cup pineapple juice,
1  unsweetened (or use
1  the juice from the
1  can of pineapple chunks)
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
2 tablespoon ginger root, cut into
1  thin (1/8-inch) slices
      ----MEAT SKEWERS----
1 1/2 lb sirloin tip
12 oz pineapple chunks

Combine the ingredients for the marinade; stir well.

Cut meat into bite-size chunks and place on skewers with 2 or 3 chunks of
pineapple in between the meat pieces.  Marinate the skewers overnight, in a
covered container, in the refrigerator.

To cook, broil the meat for about 10 minutes (depends on the size of the
chunks).  When the weather permits, grilling it outdoors on skewers is even
better.

NOTES:

*  Broiled beef in a Chinese marinade -- After frequenting a local Chinese
restaurant, I finally asked for the recipe for the marinade for the meat
that came on skewers on the pu pu platter. I was given a list of
ingredients with instructions like "heavy on this, light on this". I
devised my own amounts from this list. I served it to my family and they
enjoyed it, so I feel confident sending it to mod.recipes.

*  You may need to double the marinade recipe.  I use a Tupperware
container made especially for marinating. Any container will do, but it's
tough having to turn over all those skewers.

*  The hoisin sauce, ginger root and light soy sauce should be available in
any good grocery store.  Comments, revisions and/or additions will be
appreciated.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 12 hours marinating, 10 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

Chorizo

makemeat

5  feet medium hog casings
3 1/2 lb lean pork butt, cubed
1/2 lb pork fat, cubed
2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
2 teaspoon coarse grind black pepper
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
4 centiliter garlic, finely chopped
3 teaspoon red wine vinegar
1/4 cup dry red wine
2 tablespoon brandy
1 teaspoon fennel seed

Prepare casings. Grind meat and fat together through the coarse disk and
mix with remaining ingredients. Place in the fridge for 3-4 hours. This
gives the wine and brandy a chance to exrtract the flavor from the herbs
and spices and for the meat to absorb some of the liquid. Stuff into
casings; use within three days or freeze.

Chorizo #3

meats

5 lb untrimmed boned pork shoulder; 1 cubes
3 tablespoon red chili powder
3 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon hot paprika
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon dried red chili flakes
1 teaspoon dried oregano; crumble (up to)
10  feet hog sausage casings
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1/4 cup tequila or water
3 tablespoon red wine vinegar

(Bon Appetit, May 1986)

Combine pork, chili powder, salt, paprika, garlic, chili flakes and
oregano in large bowl. Cover mixture and marinate in refrigerator
overnight.

Soak casings in cold water mixed with distilled vinegar 1 hour.
Rinse. Slip one end of casing over faucet and run cold water through.
Clip out or tie closed any sections with holes. Soak in cold water
while preparing filling.

Coarsely grind pork misture in meat grinder or processor. Return to
bowl. Make well in center of meat mixture. Add tequila and red wine
vinegar to well; knead into meat.

Attach stuffing horn to grinder. (casing can also be stuffed with
pastry bag fitted with 1/2 inch plain tip, or a kitchen store will
have a small metal sausage stuffing horn for a few dollars). Wring
out casings and place one end over horn. Gradually push all of casing
onto horn, leaving 6 inch overhang. Tie knot in overhang. With one
hand, feed meat mixture into grinder. Meanwhile, anchor casing on top
of horn with thumb of other hand, allowing casing to unroll as
mixture is extruded. Stop occasionally to mold meat. Pierce any air
bubbles with fine needle. Do not pack too full or sausage will burst
as filling expands during cooking. Remove horn and knot casing. Knot
3 inch pieces of string around sausage at 4 inch intervals. Cut into
individual sausages. Place on paper-towel lined pan and refrigerate
uncovered overnight.

Classic Prime Rib

meats, beef

1  standing roast of beef  (4-rib, abo; ut 10-11 lbs)
2 tablespoon flavorless cooking oil
1  salt and pepper; to taste

PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. TRIM the excess fat from the roast, leaving only
1/4-inch of fat. Heat the oil in a large roasting pan over medium-to-high
heat on top of the stove. When the oil is hot, place the roast, fat-side
down, in the pan and brown for 5 minutes. Turn the roast on one end and
cook another 5 minutes. Turn on the other end and cook 5 minutes. Remove
from heat and discard fat. Sprinkle with desired salt and pepper. Place
roast in oven and immediately reduce heat to 350F. Roast approximately 12
minutes per pound for medium-rare, or about 2 hours for a 10-lb roast.
Remove the pan from the oven, remove the roast from the pan and let stand
for 25 minutes before carving. To serve, strain the gravy into a sauceboat
and carve the roast at the table, counting on about 2 people per rib.

FREEZING THE ROAST: Do not carve the entire roast if you don't have to. A
whole solid piece of meat is more successfully cooked when defrosted than a
few smaller pieces. Before freezing, heat a dry fry pan over high heat on
top of the stove. Place the remainder of the roast, cut side down, in the
pan and sear well. Allow the roast to cool to room temperature. Wrap with
freezer paper and then over wrap in plastic wrap. Label and place in the
freezer for up to 1 month. Defrost, without unwrapping, in the refrigerator
for 24 to 28 hours. To reheat defrosted rib roast, wrap prime rib in 1
layer of microwave plastic wrap and place in a covered roasting pan or
Dutch oven. Cover, place in the oven, turn temperature to 250F and cook
about 8 minutes per pound or until a meat thermometer placed in the
thickest part of the roast reads 110F. Remove pan from the oven and turn
temperature to 450F. Unwrap the roast, replace, uncovered in the pan and
replace in the oven for about 15 minutes to crust the outside.

Cochinita Pibil

meats, mexican

1  one day ahead:
3 1/2 lb (to 4-1/2) pork --
1  preferably
1  end of loin -- with fat
2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon seville orange juice (see
1  note)
1  spice grinder
1 tablespoon achiote seeds (heaping)
1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/4 teaspoon oregano
12  peppercorns
3  whole allspice
40  milliliters garlic -- peeled
1/8 teaspoon powdered chile seco (may
1  substitute hot paprika)
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon seville orange juice -or-
1  mild white vinegar
2 large pieces banana leaf
1  on serving day:
1  dutch oven
1  the wrapped meat
1/2 cup cold water
1  salsa:
1/2 cup onion -- very finely
1  chopped
3  chiles habaneros -- very
1  finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup seville orange juice

Pierce the pork all over and rub in the 2 teaspoons salt and 2
tablespoons orange juice. Set aside while you prepare the seasoning
paste.

Grind the achiote seeds, cumin, oregano, peppercorns and allspice
together to a fine powder.

Crush the garlic together with the chile seco, salt and 3 tablespoons
Seville orange juice and mix with other powdered spices. The mixture
should be a thick paste. Coat the pork with the paste.

Lightly sear the banana leaves over a bare flame to make them more
flexible. Wrap the meat up in them and leave to season in the
refrigerator for at least six hours or overnight. ON SERVING DAY:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Place a rack at the bottom of the Dutch
oven and cover the dish with a tight fitting lid. Cook for 2 1/2
hours. Turn the meat and baste it well with the juices at the bottom
of the pot. Cook for another 2 1/2 hours, or until the meat is soft
and falling off the bone.

Meanwhile, prepare the salsa: mix all ingredients together. Set aside
to season for about 2 hours. Serve in a separate dish.

After cooking, shred the meat roughly. Pour the fat and juices from
the pan over it. Serve hot, with tortillas and the sauce so that each
person can make his or her own tacos.

NOTE: A rough approximation of Seville orange juice may be attained
through the following: For 1/2 cup blended juice, combine 1 teaspoon
finely grated grapefruit rind, 3 tablespoons orange juice, 3
tablespoons grapefruit juice and 2 tablespoons lemon juice.

Codrerio Con Fava (Lamb & Fresh Fava Beans)

lamb/mutton, pileggi

      ----SEPHARDIC COOKING; MARK----

~Jewish, Turkish
2 c  Water
3 lb Lamb shank or breast of ~lamb, cut into 3" pieces
2 c  Water
3 lb Fresh fava beans
1 ts Salt, or to taste
2 ts Sugar
4    Scallions, sliced into 1/2" ~pieces

1.  Cook the lamb in 2 cups of water over moderate heat for 5 minutes,
stirring several times.  Drain well to remove excess fat.

2.  Add the 2 remaining cups of water to the pan, cover, and cook
over low heat for 1 hour.  This should tenderize the lamb.

3.  Trim the fava bean pods on both ends.  Cut the pods into 3 equal
pieces. Add them to the lamb with the salt, sugar, and scallions.
Cover the pan and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes, or until the
favas are tender. Adjust the salt.

The preparation of this Passover dish exemplifies the Turkish
preference for the natural taste of ingredients. Only the simplest of
seasoning are used here to allow the flavor of the favas to dominate.

Conejo Guisado Con Coconut (Rabbit Stew With

game, columbian, rabbit

1  text only

This recipe comes from Colombia in South America. Rabbit meat is very
low in fat and can be dry tasting, so it marries well with coconut
cream. It is best to cook the rabbit gently till it is falling off
the bone.

Chop a rabbit into serving pieces.  Chop finely one large onion and 2
cloves of garlic.  Seed and slice a large green capsicum, half a
large red capsicum and finely slice 3 birdseye chillies (decrease the
quantity and discard the seeds if you can't cope with too much chilli
heat). Peel and chop a large tomato and have ready 400 ml strong veal
or chicken stock and
150 ml coconut cream.

Heat a little oil in a frying pan and brown the rabbit pieces.
Transfer them to a large saucepan.  In the remaining oil in the
frying pan, saute the onions, capsicums and chillies. Add to the
saucepan with the tomato, salt and pepper to taste, and the stock.
Bring just to simmering point, cover and cook very gently for about 2
hours or even more. Lift the rabbit pieces out onto a dish and turn
the heat up high under the saucepan. Reduce the liquid in the
saucepan by about half.

Lower the heat and stir in the coconut cream.  Return the rabbit
pieces and cook gently, stirring, for a few minutes. Serve with rice.

Cooking Corned Beef

beef

1  text only

Wash under running water to remove surface brine.

Cover with boiling water and simmer, allowing about 1 hour per pound,
or until a fork can penetrate to center. Always slice corned beef
very thin, diagonally across the grain.  A classic accompaniment of
corned beef served hot is:

Cabbage wedges simmered with the beef the last 15 minutes of cooking.
Serve hot with: Horseradish Sauce Boiled Potatoes Gnocchi with Farina
Serve corned beef cold with: Horseradish

To press for slicing, cool the meat and force it into a deep pan;
cover and refrigerate weighted.  The moisture pressed from the meat
should form a jellied coating.

After cooking corned beef as in 1, above, you may coat it with the
following glaze and bake in a preheated 350F oven for 15 minutes or
until the topping is set.

Combine and mix well: 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 tablespoon water 1
tablespoon soy sauce 2 teaspoons paprika 1/2 teaspoon ginger

Tenderized corned beef can now be bought for oven roasting; follow
manufacturer's directions.

Cooking Duck~ Chinese Style

meats, chinese

1  stephen ceideburg
1 each duck

HANDY CHINESE TRICKS FOR COOKING A WHOLE DUCK Cooking a duck can be
intimidating to home cooks. Unlike chicken, there's a layer of fat
that can cause problems. When duck is simply roasted, it often cooks
unevenly, leaving a lot of excess fat. In addition, much of the
potentially delicious skin is discarded. Chinese cooks slove these
problems by applying two or more cooking methods to melt away most of
the fat while enchancing the flavor of the meat. As a bonus, this
technique can produce duck skin that is succulently crisp. For
example, a duck may be seasoned and hung overnight in a cool, airy
place, then steamed, perhaps smoked, and finally fried to a golden
brown. Or, a duck may be browned over high heat in a wok full of oil
(which melts away some of the fat), drained, and finally simmered in
a wine/soy/rock sugar sauce, which is reduced at the end of the
cooking time to a syrupy glaze. Sometimes just the skin is stuffed
with boned duck meat, which has been mixed with glutinous rice or
barley, mushrooms, Chinese dates, lotus seeds and ham; then the whole
thing is steamed. The famous Peking Duck, which many rank as one of
the world's greatest dishes, begins by easing the skin away from the
meat then pumping in air so the whole duck inflats like a balloon.
The duck then is scalded in a honey-vinegar mixture and hung
overnight to dry before being cooked. This dish is not a good choice
for the home cook because the duck is best roasted suspended in a
special clay-lined oven. The lacquered-looking ducks that hang in
Chinese delicatessens, somethimes mistakenly thought to be Peking
ducks, actually are Cantonese roast ducks. After basting the skins
and hanging the ducks overnight, they are roasted to golden brown
perfection ~- a sauce of five-spices, star anise, wine and garlic
simmering in their cavities. For not much more than the price of an
uncooked duck, these, by the half or whole, make excellent take-out
food. The method that follows for making Sichauan Crispy Skin Duck is
typical of Chinese duck cookery. It requires a few steps over a
couple of days, and two cooking procedures, but it's not difficult -
although frying a whole duck in a wok full of oil may be a new
experience.

Corned Beef

meats

8 lb brisket; boneless
1 cup salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon mixed pickling spices
1  garlic; the whole head
1/4 teaspoon saltpeter
1 pinch alum

This recipe is 'supposedly' from GREENWALD'S SUPER DELICATESSEN,
Louisville, KY. It was in LOVE AND KNISHES; Sara Kasdan; 1956. Sara
says it comes from a 'hamish' deli; (very homelike) in a poor
neighobrhood. Doubtful it still exists. And my copy of the book is on
its way out too!!! OK here goes...Place brisket in a large stoneware
crock and cover completely with water. Add remaining ingredients,
stirring to distribute them evenly (I   would add more garlic and
more peppercorns; never enough in the mix) Let it stand at room temp
for 4 days. place in the fridge for 16 days.   Remove from the crock
and place in a large kettle. Cover with boiling water and boil for 1
1/2 hours. Turn off heat and let stand in water in which it has
cooked for at least 2 hours. Remove meat to another deep kettle.
Place in sink and let cold waater run into the kettle (not directly
ON the meat) for 1 hour. (this seals the meat juices) Remove brisket
from the water and refrigerate unntil ready to use. If you serve hot;
steanm...do NOT boil. Well let me add that she quotes Mr. Greenwald.
"You have to be crazy to go to all this trouble when you can buy at
Greenwald's fancy new delicatessen." Mr. Greenwald is right...you
HAVE TO BE CRAZY; but if you can't get it any other way...this sounds
KOSHER to me. Perhaps one of our great Kosher cooks can come up with
a more modern method, <grin>!!!  Oh yes, the deli moved after WWII to
the Highland section...a fancy, 'shmancy' neighborhood.

Corned Beef & Cabbage Boiled By James Beard C

vegetables, beef

6 lb corned beef brisket
1 each onion; peeled & stuck with:
3 each cloves (for onion)
10 large garlic cloves; peeled
1 tablespoon pepper; freshly ground black
      ----ACCOMPANYING VEGETABLES----
6 medium onions; peeled (stick cloves in o
6 large carrots; scraped
6 medium potatoes; (or 10 for hash)
6 each turnips; peeled
1 medium cabbage

Note: To cook the corned beef you will need a good, 8 to 10 quart
size pot which can be aluminum, Magnalite, Corning Ware or anything
of that sort. The size is more important than the material. * Cooking
the Corned Beef * Wipe the corned beef well with a damp cloth; put it
in the pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over rather
high heat. Boil for 5 to 6 minutes, skimming off the grey foamy scum
that rises to the surface with a wire skimmer or large spoon. This
will give you a clearer, purer broth. It's very important with any
boiled meat, to skim off this scum drawn from the meat. Add the onion
stuck with cloves, the garlic cloves, and the pepper and boil another
10 minutes, skimming. Then reduce the heat to a simmer (250dF on a
burner with a thermostat), cover the pot, and let it simmer at a
faint, gentle ebullition for 2 hours. At this point test the meat for
tenderness with a large fork. As this is not a very tender piece of
meat, it will offer some resistance, but it should just yield to the
fork. You must be careful not to overcook corned beef or the meat
will become dry and stringy. It's very important to maintain some
moisture in the meat. If you are not sure about the tenderness,
remove the meat to a plate and cut of a tiny piece from the edge and
taste it. If you have a meat thermometer check the internal
temperature, which should be between 145dF and 150dF. If the meat
seems tender turn off the heat and let it rest in the liquid. If it
does not test tender either continue cooking or, if you have started
it in the morning and are ahead of serving time, leave it in the
liquid and finish the cooking later. * Cooking the Vegetables * Start
1 hour before serving. Traditionally, all the vegetables for a corned
beef dinner are cooked in the pot with the meat. I have long since
decided that the vegetables look and taste better if they are cooked
separately in plain salted water, instead of in a briny, fatty broth.
If you have sufficient pots and burners, I recommend that you follow
this procedure, as each vegetable will then retain its own character
and flavor. However, it is perfectly acceptable to cook the potatoes
with the beef, provided you scrub them and leave them in their skins
so they don't absorb the fat, and to use only one extra pot, first
putting in the longest-cooking vegetables (the onions and carrots),
then the turnips, and finally the cabbage. Or, if you have a large
pot and a steamer, put the onions and carrots in the water and steam
the turnips over them. Cook the cabbage separately.
Here is a timetable for the vegetables:
:   ONIONS. Put in a pot with water to cover, season with 1 tblsp
salt. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer 1 hour or until crisply
tender when tested with the point of a knife. :   CARROTS. Follow the
same procedure, seasoning the water with 2 tsps salt and 1/2 tsp.
marjoram. Simmer 30 minutes, or until tender when tested.
:   POTATOES. Scrub but to not peel. Follow the same procedure,
seasoning the water with 1 tblsp salt, or simmer with the corned beef
for 30 minutes or until tender. If you are planning to make corned
beer hash, cook the 4 extra potatoes, otherwise allow 1 potato per
person. : TURNIPS. Leave whole if small; halve or quarter if large.
Follow the same procedure, seasoning the water with 3 tsps salt.
Simmer for 20 minutes or until tender when tested.
:   CABBAGE. Remove coarse or discolored outer leaves and cut in
sixths. Put in a pot with water to cover, seasoned with 2 tsps salt;
cover. Bring to a boil and boil rapidly for 10 to 12 minutes, or
until just tender but not overcooked or soggy. When ready to serve,
remove the beef and discard the broth as it cannot be saved for any
other use. Let the beef stand on a hot platter in a warm place for 10
minutes, to firm and settle the meat. This makes it easier to carve.
Surround it with the drained vegetables, the potatoes still in their
skins. Do not add butter. The vegetables are better plain. Slice only
as much meat as you need, keeping the rest in one piece for future
use. (Corned beef hash, or cold corned beef sandwiches). Serve with a
variety of mustards, horseradish, and, if you have any, good homemade
pickles.

4 lb corned beef brisket
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoon pickling spices
1 each orange, unpeeled, sliced
1 each onion, sliced
1 each celery stalk, sliced
1 each carrot, peeled, sliced

Soak corned beef in water to cover for 30 minutes or longer if deeply
corned. Preheat oven to 300 degF. Remove the corned beef from the water and
pat dry to remove any salt on the surface. Place a large sheet of heavy
duty foil in a shallow pan or cookie sheet. Place the corned beef in the
center of the foil and pour 1/4 cup fresh water over it. Sprinkle the meat
with the pickling spices, then arrange the orange slices, onion slices,
celery and carrot over and around the meat. Bring the long ends of the foil
up over the meat and seal with a tight double fold. Seal the other ends,
turning them up so the liquid cannot run out. Bake for 5 to 6 hours.
Discard the cooked orange and vegetables. Let stand for 20 minutes before
slicing.

Corned Tongue

beef, jewish

1  tongue, beef
1  water, as needed
1  salt, kosher; as needed
1  egg, in shell
1/2 cup sugar, brown, dark
2  bay leaf; crumbled
1/2 teaspoon allspice, whole; bruised
1/2 teaspoon peppercorns; bruised
2 teaspoon coriander seeds; bruised
1 teaspoon mustard seeds; bruised
2  garlic clove; peeled

Select a ceramic, glass or enameled crock or bowl large enough to
hold both the tongue and enough brine to cover the tongue by two or
more inches. Be sure the container will fit in the refrigerator. To
determine the brine quantity needed, enclose the tongue in a plastic
bag and run cold water into the container to cover the bagged meat by
two to three inches. Remove the tongue. Stir kosher salt gradually
into the water, dissolving thoroughly each time, until an egg will
float in it. (This will run about a cup and a half of salt.) Remove
the egg once it's served its purpose and pour the brine into a pot.
Stir all the other ingredients into the brine and bring to a boil,
then simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Let brine cool completely.
Remove the tongue from the plastic bag and prick it well all over
with a skewer or larding needle. Return to the crock. Once the brine
has cooled, pour it over the tongue. Cover with Saran, then add a
plate (weighted, if need be) to keep the meat well under the surface.
Cover the whole crock with Saran and refrigerate for 10 days to 2 1/2
weeks (allow three days a pound curing time).  Turn the meat every
few days, and be sure to keep it always sunk in the brine. To cook:
Put the tongue in a pot with water to cover by several inches, two or
three carrots coarsely chopped, a whole onion or two (peeled), a few
tablespoons of vinegar, and simmer, partly covered, until the meat is
very tender. Remove from the stock, and slit the skin and peel it
away. Serve hot or cold.

Cottagers' Meatloaf

meats

1 1/8 lb lean belly pork *
3/4 lb pig's liver
6 oz lean green streaky bacon
6 oz grated carrot
6 oz fresh brown breadcrumbs
2 small onions
1 large green pepper
1  fresh chopped parsley
1  garlic clove; crushed w/salt
4 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon (generous) dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon (generous) dried marjoram

*Note: Weight of pork is after trimming away bones, rind and excess fat.

Mince the meats fairly finely, grate the carrot and chop the onion and
green pepper very finely.  Mix all the ingredients very thoroughly with
your hands and season well with salt and pepper.  Fry a small nugget to
check seasoning and adjust to taste.  Oil a 2 lb loaf tin, line with
greaseproof paper and oil again.  Pack the mixture into the tin. Press it
down well, dome the top of the meat nicely and press 2 or 3 bay leaves on
top.

Cover the tin with foil.  Stand it in a roasting pan and pour in enough
boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the loaf tin. Bake at 350 F
(180 C) gas mark 4 for 1 hour.  Reduce temperature to 325 F (160 C) gas
mark 3, remove foil lid and bake for a further 30 minutes.

Cool the cooked meatloaf for 30 minutes, then tilt the tin and pour off the
juices.  Set aside in a cold place overnight before serving to allow
flavours to blend and mature.

Crispy Lamb Chops With Thyme Sauce

meats

12  lamb chops, well trimmed
1  salt and pepper
1 large potato; peeled and grated
1  egg
1 tablespoon fresh basil, thinly sliced
4 cup vegetable oil
      ----THYME SAUCE----
6  sprigs fresh thyme
1 cup white wine
1 tablespoon garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon shallots, chopped
1  bay leaf
1  lemon, juiced
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 lb butter; cold  cut into small piec
1  salt and pepper
      ----GARNISH----
4  sprigs fresh thyme

Season the lamb chops with the salt and pepper, and set them aside.

In a medium bowl place the potato, egg, and basil.  Add a dash of the
salt and pepper.  Mix the ingredients together well.  Squeeze the
mixture together with your hands to remove any excess water.  Firmly
pack the potato mixture around the lamb chops so that they are coated.

In a large saucepan place the vegetable oil and heat it on medium high
until it is hot (350F).  Deep-fry the coated lamb chops for 5 to 7
minutes, or until the crust is crisp and golden brown, and the lamb is
cooked to the desired doneness.

On each of 4 individual serving plates place the Thyme Sauce.  Place
3 lamb chops on top.  Garnish the dish with a sprig of thyme.

THYME SAUCE:  In a small saucepan place the thyme, white wine, garlic,
shallots, bay leaf, and lemon juice.  Heat the ingredients on medium
low and let them cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid is
reduced to 1/3.  Add the heavy cream and simmer it for 12 to 15
minutes, or until the liquid is reduced to 1/2.  While whisking
constantly, add the pieces of butter one at a time.  Season the sauce
with the salt and the pepper. Strain the sauce.

Crown Roast Of Frankfurters With Baked Beans

meats, holidays

3  (16 oz.) cans baked beans
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 teaspoon dijon mustard
3 pkg (12 oz. ea.) frankfurters
1  (about 21 total)

Preheat oven to 400F.  IN a medium saucepan, combine baked beans,
onion, brown sugar and mustard.  Stir until well mixed. Cook over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, until beans are hot, 10 to 15
minutes.

Meanwhile, rinse frankfurters and blot dry with paper towels. Spear 3
hotdogs together by pushing a toothpick horizantally thorugh upper
third of franks. Repeat with remaining weiners.

Place a 6-inch-tall 1 1/2 to 2 quart baking dish about 4 1/2 inches in
diameter (such as a bean pot) on an ovenproof serving platter. Lean
frankfurters, skewered ends up, around outside edge of bean pot. Tie a
piece of kitchen string around center of franks to secure them in a
circle. Remove toothpicks.

Transfer hot beans from saucepan to pot in center of franks and place
platter and all in oven.  Bake until weiners are golden brown and
beans are bubbly, about 25 minutes. To serve, spoon beans directly
form pot and use tongs to remove frankfurters.

This is sure to be a kid pleaser at celebrations where adult food
would not be appreciated.  I can remember, when I was a kid, my
grandmother for New Year's Day celebrations would always serve
Lutefisk - (which I hated - it just stood there on the platter - a
gelatinous - fish smelling opaque mess that shook like a live
jellyfish and we kids were expected to eat it). I would far rather
have had hot dogs!

2 tablespoon butter, soft
1 1/2 lb potatoes, peeled, sliced

hour, and check that the vegetables are nearly cooked. Finish the
cooking without the foil, to let the top get brown and crusty.

Curried Lamb Shanks In Wine

lamb

4 tablespoon oil
4  lamb shanks
4 tablespoon flour
1 1/2 teaspoon curry powder
1 cup water
1 cup dry white wine
1  salt, garlic salt and pepper
1  onion slice thinly

I cook lamb occasionally in my Asian recipes, but not often as no one
but myself likes it here.  The main thing to remember about lamb is
that it should be medium rare. Actually, I like it seared on the
outside and nearly raw in the middle, but these days that's not such
a hot idea. Heat oil in a heavy skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Add
shanks and brown slowly on all sides.  Remove shanks form pan. Add
flour and curry powder to drippings and blend well; add water and
wine, stirring, until thickened.

Return shanks to pan, season with salt, garlic salt and pepper. Top
with onions.  Cover and simmer gently for 1 1/2 hours until tender.

Serves 4.

beef to container with onions and potatoes; keep warm. Again using
the same frying pan add broth, Worcestershire, salt, and pepper. Cook
over high heat until reduced by about half; then pour over hash
mixture. Mix lightly but thoroughly. Using the same pan, melt 1 to 2
tablespoons butter and fry eggs until done as desired. Spoon hash
onto a warm platter and arrange eggs on top. Garnish with the lettuce
and tomatoes. Serve with coarse salt, if you wish. Makes 4 to 6
servings. Biksemad (bick-sa-mod) is the Danish name of this delicious
beef and potatoe hash. It makes a delightful entree for a casual
supper or brunch. From the "Sunset Scandinavian Cook Book", published

Daps Centurionis

main dish, meats

      ----ROMULAN LAMB AND LENTILS----
1  6 to 7 lb leg of lamb
1  flour
1  onion; cut into chunks
1  salt and pepper
2 tablespoon cooking oil
1 cup onion; chopped
2 cup lentils
10 oz beef broth
10 oz water
1  bay leaf
1 cup green onions; sliced
1/2 cup chopped parsley
1/3 cup pan gravy for roast lamb
1  roasting bag

About 4 hours before you want to serve, get the leg of lamb ready and
put it in the oven; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, dust the inside
of the baking bag with flour, put in the large onion as a layer of
chunks and put the leg of lamb in on top of that. Sprinkle the lamb
with salt and pepper and close the bag. Poke some holes in the top of
the bag. If you wish, stick a meat thermometer into the thickest part
of the roast, right through the bag so you can read the dial: 160 to
190 degrees covers the range from moderately rare to well done. About
40 minutes before serving time, get the lentils going. Heat the oil
in a saucepan and cook the chopped onion until soft and golden. Add
the lentils, beef broth, water, bay leaf, salt and pepper. Simmer for
about 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Fish out the bay
leaf and add the green onions and the parsley. Mix well, and as you
are serving, stir in 1/3 cup of pan gravy from the roast, with as
little fat as possible.

900 g/2 lb lean pork without skin or bone 1.1 litres/2 pints/5 cups beef
stock, skimmed of fat 125 g/4 oz ground almonds 1 tablespoon rice flour or
cornflour 1 tablespoon currants 1/4 teaspoon ground mace 1/8 teaspoon
ground cloves Salt and pepper A little oil for greasing Garnish: White
sugar and ground mace for sprinkling Small real or dried flowers

These meatballs can be used as snacks for two or three people, or as a
garnish for roast poultry or game.  Cook the pork in the stock until just
about tender.  Drain it, reserving the stock,  Use 275 ml/ 10 fl oz/ 1 1/4
cups of the stock to make almond 'milk' with the ground almonds and rice
flour or cornflour as described in a previous recipe. Put this and the rest
of the stock aside, separately, to cool.

Cut the pork into small slices.  It should still be moist but not pink.
Process the slices in batches in an electric blender, adding the currants,
spices and seasoning while processing.  Form the mixture into 18 meatballs
about 4 cm/1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Roll these in a lightly greased
frying-pan until lightly browned all over, then leave to cool. Thin down
the almond 'milk' if necessary with a little stock; it should coat the
meatballs lightly.  Cover each meatball with a little 'sauce'. Just before
serving, sprinkle the dish lightly with white sugar and the golden mace,
and decorate with small vivid flowers.

Deep Rich Beef Brisket

beef, outdoor

1  beef brisket (3-5 lb)
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoon peanut or canola oil
1 cup water
1 teaspoon instant beef bouillon
2 large onions, thinly sliced
2 large tomatoes, diced with seeds
1  .removed (see note)
3  cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 cup catsup
2 teaspoon cornstarch
3 tablespoon water

Arrange charcoal for indirect cooking (not directly under meat). Place
flour, salt, pepper and paprika in a large zip-lock baggie. Place
meat in bag and shake to coat.  Heat oil in a large skillet and sear
meat until it is browned. Set brisket aside; add water and bring to a
boil. Add bouillon and dissolve. Stir in remaining ingredients
(except cornstarch and 3 tbsp water); mix well and remove from heat.
Place brisket on center of a large piece of tin foil. (Set skillet
aside, you will be using it later on.) Pour bouillon mixture over
both sides of brisket. Wrap brisket tightly with two more sheets of
tin foil turning the wrap 90 degrees after each wrapping. This will
help keep the juices from seeping out.

When coals are white hot throw the brisket on. Cover and cook for
about 2 hours; turning it over after one hour. Add more charcoal as
necessary. Remove from grill and carefully open package without
spilling juices. Pour juices into skillet; recover brisket to keep
warm. Combine cornstarch and water; mix well. Pour into skillet and
heat to boiling to make gravy; stirring constantly. Serve brisket
when gravy has thickened.

NOTE: To remove seeds cut tomato in half. Hold it over the sink and
gently squeeze with your fingers. The pulp and seeds will begin to
loosen and you'll quickly get the hang of it. Rotate tomato half
around with your fingers to completely remove pulp and seeds. Repeat
with remaining half and then dice.

Dendeng Pedas ('hot' Fried Beef)

beef, indonesian

1 kg (2 lb) topside (beef)
      ----MARINADE----
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon dark soya sauce
      ----BUMBU----
10  shallots
4  red chillis (or 2 tbs sambal ulek)
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  salt
1 tablespoon lemon or fresh lime juice

* Cut the beef fairly thin and trim it into small, square pieces.
Marinate it for 1 hour or longer. Remember that pedas=hot++spicy hot!
This is fried beef, with a robust flavour of chilli. Slice the
shallots finely. Seed and slice the chillis.  Fry them in a
tablespoonful of oil, in a wok, stirring all the time until they are
golden brown. Add salt to taste. Keep hot. Put a tablespoonful of oil
in a thick frying-pan, and fry the slices of meat a few at a time.
Three minutes on each side will be ample*. When all the pieces are
cooked, put them into the wok with the shallots and chilli. Heat, and
mix well.  Sprinkle over the mixture 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice,
or, better still, fresh lime juice. Stir, and add more salt if
necessary.  Serve hot, with rice. * NOTE: In Indonesia, the meat is
usually fried until crisp.  You can even buy sun-dried dendeng which
only needs coating with bumbu and frying. Crisp dendeng can be rather
tough, and I prefer it as described above; however, a purist might
say that my recipe is not 'genuinely' Indonesian. Makes 6 servings.

Dixie's Fried Chicken

meats, poultry

1  frying chicken, cut up
1  egg
1  flour
1  milk

Wash and unless you are 19 and a beanpole with a family history of
living to 108, skin chicken pieces. PLACE WASHED CHICKEN PIECES on
CLEAN FRESH paper towel. Beat egg and milk together in bowl. Sift
flour with the following spices to taste: salt or Lowry's seasoned
salt, black pepper, Old Bay, curry powder (not much!), poultry
seasoning, red pepper (not much!) mustard powder (not much!) other
suitable spices to your taste. MSG may be purchased in ominous
looking bag from Chinese restaurant supply if you really want to
emulate the Colonel and really be a slacker, but Lowry's Seasoned
salt has enough MSG to please most. Should you not prefer MSG, skip
the Lowry's and use table salt. Note: Some people react to MSG so you
can query your guests. The Colonel is loaded with MSG, that's what
makes it taste so much like the Colonel. Deal with MSG according to
your preferences. On with the show. In a preferably electric skillet
at 350 (perfect!), or failing that, a non-stick skillet on Med. Hi,
put on some Puritan oil. (Oil is less likely to splatter you and oil
does not smoke.) Other oils are OK but Puritan is rated healthiest.
About 1/4" deep. Allow to reach 350. NEVER place the washed and/or
cooked chicken back in contact with any surface OR utensil (tongs,
etc.) that has touched the pre-cooked chicken. There is a very
prevalent problem with chicken just lately, but cooking takes care of
it. Always, always, use a clean surface/utensil. Put flour mixture in
bowl or pie tins, or a bag, depending on if you want to roll or
shake. Roll or shake chicken pieces in flour mixture; then dip in
milk mixture. Then roll or shake them in the flour mixture (2nd
time.) Lower coated chicken pieces into 350 degree oil with tongs (DO
NOT EVER PIERCE THE PIECES) and cook EIGHT MINUTES ON EACH SIDE.
Covered skillet yields more tender crust. Uncovered yields crispier
crust. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER poke the frying pieces with a
fork, knife, etc. Use the 8 minutes on each side rule at 350 degrees.
Poking releases juices that SPLATTER when they reach the hot oil.
This burns you. Also, don't let any water or moisture drop into the
oil. If this does not happen, it will not spatter you. If you need to
check done-ness, you can remove the very thickest piece from the
skillet onto a paper towel, and peek down to the bone and check for
any pink. There should not be any pink. While frying, if the outside
begins to darken too much before the inside is done, your heat is too
high. If this happens and you turn it down, you can continue frying
the pieces at an appropriate heat even with the outisde a little
dark, and it won't really hurt anything. The inside will still be
great! Gravy: When chicken is done, pour out all the oil except for
about 1/8" or a little less depending on how many people want gravy.
Mix a little bit (about 1/4 cup) of either regular flour or the kind
in the small round box that PROMISES not to lump, especially for
sauces and pastes and gravies, with COLD water to make a thin gruel
in the measuring cup. COLD helps it mix and not lump (this works with
cornstarch when making cobblers, pies, etc. too!) Mix the flour and
cold water with fork. Now, assemble extra flour, the whole carton of
milk, and water, and pepper and salt, in real real easy reach of the
skillet. Turn up the heat in the skillet with your smaller amount of
oil and drippin's, to about 425 or "Hi" for a minute. When it looks
alive again, stir in your flour water mixture REAL FAST and keep
stirring! It may start to look like it's going to lump but keep
stirring fast! The object is to brown that flour and oil goop as much
as you can before you add the milk. This is tricky and it never turns
out right. When you give up on browning the flour/water/oil goop any
more before it is cement, slowly begin to add milk and STIR FAST A
LOT. It will thicken and you add more milk as it cooks. Oh, by the
way, turn it back down to about 350 or Med. as it bubbles. When you
have about half the volume of gravy you are going to need, switch to
water instead of milk. You will not believe if you taste the yummy
chicken, that more salt and pepper will be needed for this gravy, but
if you taste it at this point you will see that the gravy is VERY
bland. You will need to add a LOT of salt, pepper, seasoned salt,
whatever is your taste. If your gravy does not go right and clumps up
during the browning stage, you are in fine company. Just go ahead and
add the milk, stir, and put the whole thing in the food processor;
afterwards, you can return the mixture to the skillet and teach it
who's boss. Just remember to season it enough. And serve on top of
some ho-made mashed potatoes!!!!!! P.S. M.S.G. fans, Lowry's seasoned
salt is EXCELLENT in mashed potatoes. Not gourmet. But very tasty and
nobody has to know! Oh, OK, you may want to check with your guests
before using anything with M.S.G. :-)

Dr. Oetker's Rouladen

beef, german

8  beef, thin slices
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1  mustard, prepared
1 teaspoon paprika
4 oz bacon, uncooked; diced
1 cup tomato puree
1/2 cup onion; diced
1 tablespoon lemon juice
8 tablespoon oil
1  sour cream; (optional)
1 cup ; water, boiling
1  creme fraiche; (optional)

Cut thin slices of roasting beef to around 4 x 6 inches off a roast.
It is best to cut the meat WITH the grain of the meat, so the slices
will hold together. Pound the slices lightly to flatten and tenderize
them. Brush lightly with prepared mustard. Then sprinkle the slices
with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. In a small bowl
mix together the diced bacon and diced onions.  Spread the mixture on
the meat slices. Then, starting at the narrow end, roll up the meat
slices and secure them with skewers, toothpicks, or string.

Heat the oil in a heavy pot.  Brown the rolls well in the oil. Add
about 1 cup of boiling water to the pot VERY CAREFULLY! Cover the
meat and braise gently until done, about 2 to 2-1/2 hours. Add water
as needed to keep level fairly constant.  When the meat is cooked,
remove the rolls to a hot plate and thicken the gravy with corn
starch and season to taste. The sauce may be seasoned with paprika,
tomato puree, lemon juice, sour cream, and/or creme fraiche.

Serve this with a potato or pasta dish.

Time: 2:00 Peel the onion and slice into thin rings. Wash beef, drain
it well, and put in an earthenware bowl with the onion, peppercorns,
cloves, bay leaf, vinegar, and 1-1/3 cups water. Cover the bowl and
allow the meat to marinate in a cool place for 4 to 6 days. Turn the
meat twice daily, adding additional vinegar and water as needed to
keep the meat covered. Once the marinating is complete, remove the
meat and dry it. In a pot, heat the shortening.  Brown the meat on
all sides and salt it to taste. Carefully add 1 cup hot water from
the side of the pot and crumbled ginger snaps. Leave the pot to
simmer gently with the lid on. Turn the meat from time to time,
adding water if necessary.  The will be about 1 1/2 hours. When the
meat is ready, serve it with the gravy in which it has been cooked
thickened with a bit of corn starch if necessary. This is very good
with dumplings. 

Dry Cure Southwest Jerky

meats

1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoon cumin
2  cloves garlic minced
2 lb steak sliced thinly

Combine ingredients and thoroughly mix together. This is a dry
marinade so there is no liquid. Sprinkle the spice mixture on the
meat slices and work into the grain with your fingers. Cover and
marinate overnight. Place trays in the oven and dry at 145'F. for
first 4 hrs. then set oven 130'F. until dry.(4 to 8 hrs.) Jerky
should be hard but not brittle. Blot up any fat that appears with
paper towels. *For a chewy texture, slice the meat with the grain, or
across the grain for more tender jerky. Thats all! It may take a few
trys to figure out exactly how long to dry the meat, but you're still
eating while you're trying so it's not that bad. Well, good luck, I
hope that you like it. And, sorry this note is so long.

Dublin Coddle (Irish)

main dish, meats

1 lb bacon bits (pref. smoked)
1 lb good meaty sausages
3 each large onions
3 each potatoes (or even four)
1 single handful fresh parsley
1 single grind fresh pepper

Bacon bits are the off-cuts from the various types of bacon, which
are sold very cheaply in Dublin pork butchers' shops, specifically
for making coddle.  They contain a good mixture of fat, lean and
skin. I prefer to buy regular bacon with the rind on and cut it up
into even-sized pieces. Leave on the rind, as it adds great richness
to the soup. Buy the finest quality pork sausages you can afford (or
find).  Peel and chop the onions roughly. Peel the potatoes as thinly
as possible. If they are large, then cut them into two or three large
pieces;  otherwise leave them whole.
Chop the fresh parsley. -- Place a layer of onions in the bottom of a
heavy pot with a good close-fitting lid. Layer all the other
ingredients, giving each layer a grind or so of fresh-ground pepper.
Add no more than 2 cups of water to the pot.  Bring the water to the
boil, then reduce the heat at once, cover tightly, and barely simmer
for 2 to 5 hours. The perfect way to cook it is in a heavy casserole
pot in a very low oven at 250F.  I know this sounds vague, but if the
pot is heavy and the lid tight, it really can't come to any harm. The
longer and slower the cooking, the better.  If you prefer, before
serving, remove the sausages and quickly brown them on one side under
the broiler. Serve with white soda farl to mop up the soup, and
bottles of stout.  It is a most restorative food. -- From THE POOLBEG

3 1/2 lb boneless haunch of venison or reind; eer
3 tablespoon butter; softened
1  salt & pepper
1 1/3 cup beef stock
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon flour
2 teaspoon red currant jelly
1/2 oz brown norwegian goat cheese; (gjetst), finely diced
1/2 cup sour cream

Preheat oven to 475F. Tie the roaast up neatly at 1/2" intervals with

brown, reduce the heat to 375F and sprinkle the roast generously
with salt and pepper. Pour the stock into the pan and cook the roast,
uncovered, for 1 1/4 hours. With a large spoon or bulb baster, baste
the meat with the pan juices every half hour or so. The interior
meat, when finished, should be slightly rare, or about 150F on a
meat thermometer. Remove the roast to a heated platter, cover it
loosely and let rest in the turned off oven while you make the sauce.
Skim and discard the fat from the pan juices. Measure the remaining
liquid and either reduce to 1 cup by boiling it rapidly or add enough
water to make up 1 cup. In a small, heavy saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon
of butter and stir in 1 tablespoon of flour. Stirring continuously
with a wooden spoon, cook this roux for 6 to 8 minutes over low heat
until it is a nut brown color. Be careful not to let it burn or it
will give the sauce a bitter flavor. Now, with a wire whisk, beat the
pan juices into the roux. Next whisk in the jelly and cheese. Beat
until they dissolve and the sauce is absolutely smooth, then stir in
the sour cream. Do not allow the sauce to boil. Taste for seasoning,
remove the strings from the roast and carve the meat in thin slices.
Pass the sauce separately.

leaves - 3 to 6 layers. Possible to use seaweed, corn stalk leaves.
Cover this with layers of wet burlap sacks. start at outside and
layer like shingles on a roof to the middle. Put pit on a small
section of small wire fence section like you keep chicks in. With
tongs put several hot rocks in pig cavity near thickest part of meat.
Spread one layer banana leaves on burlap and place pig in the middle
of the pit. (encased in the wire). Banana leaves over the pig and
then cover with burlap again starting from outside and like roof
shingles to the middle. Shovel the dirt back in the pit completely
covering. Don't leave any holes. Sprinkle lightly with garden hose.
Steam will escape but keep well covered. About 4 or 5 in the

Easy Beef Burgundy

beef

4 slice bacon
1 cup onion; chopped
2 lb round steak; cut into bite size pieces
1 pinch salt; to taste
1 pinch pepper; to taste
2 cup whole fresh mushrooms, or 1 cup can; or 1 cup canned
1 teaspoon garlic; chopped
1 cup burgundy wine
1 cup water
1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
1 tablespoon dried celery flakes
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1  bay leaf
2 tablespoon flour

My old Sunset "Favorite Recipes" cookbook has a "Beef Burgundy" recipe
which I've made for years. Over time, I've adapted the recipe to take
advantage of a few shortcuts without sacrificing the great flavor. The
following is my version:

In a Dutch oven or heavy saucepan cook the onion and bacon until
onion is soft, but not browned. With a slotted spoon, remove onion
and bacon and set aside. Add the round steak to the pan drippings and
cook until browned on all sides. Sprinkle the meat with salt and
pepper, then add the mushrooms, garlic, wine, water, parsley, celery,
thyme, and bay leaf. Return the onion and bacon to the pan and stir
well, then cover and cook over low heat for 1-1/2 hours, or until
meat is tender. Keep an eye on the liquid in the pan and add water
and reduce heat if it seems to be boiling away quickly. When tender,
with a slotted spoon, remove meat mixture from the liquid to a
serving bowl. Discard the bay leaf. In a cup, mix some of the hot
liquid with the flour, then stir into the liquid remaining in the
pan. Cook stirring constantly until thickened (should only take about
1 minute). Pour the thickened liquid over the meat mixture in the
serving bowl, stir to mix, and serve immediately over rice.

El Charro Chile Con Carne (Red Chile & Beef

beef

3 lb beef roast (eye of round or
1  brisket)
1 cup flour
1 tablespoon salt -- or to taste
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup oil
3 cup salsa de chile colorado
1 tablespoon garlic puree -- *
1 teaspoon oregano

* Garlic Puree - peel 8 whole heads of garlic by smashing the cloves
with the side of a wide knife; the peel will slip off easily then.
Put the peeled garlic in a blender with about 2 cups of water, and
puree. Drain, if necessary, and store in a tightly closed glass jar
in the refrigerator.

This is the basic meat preparation that we serve in bowls along with
tortillas, on combination plates or as filling for Burros, Chimis,
Chalupas, Enchiladas and Tamales.

Cut meat into 1-inch pieces and place, a handful at a time, into a
paper bag containing flour, salt and pepper. Shake well. Repeat with
remaining beef.

In a large skillet, heat oil. Add beef, a batch at a time so that the
skillet is not crowded, and brown slowly. Add Salsa De Chile Colorado,
garlic and oregano. Cook over low heat 1 hour or longer, until meat is
tender, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. Add a little hot
water if necessary.

Fiery Beef (Bulgoki)

beef, korean

2 lb beef filet or sirloin
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seed *
4 tablespoon light soy sauce
2 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoon minced scallions
1  tabasco sauce to taste
1  clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated ginger

* Toasted sesame seed:  Place 1 cup sesame seed and 1 teaspoon salt
in a skillet, brown seeds slowly until they are toast colored and
puffed. Stir constantly while toasting. Remove from heat and allow to
cool. Pulverize seeds in a mortar or a blender. Store in a tightly
capped bottle.

Cut beef into very thin strips and pound to flatten; then cut into
medium size squares.  Combine all the other ingredients. The
marinade, as the name of the dish implies, should be quite fiery. Mix
meat and marinade and set aside for 4 to 5 hours, or longer if
refrigerated. Broil very quickly over hot charcoal, dip in Bulgoki
sauce (next recipe) and serve immediately with white rice.

NOTE:  The marinated beef can also be fried in hot peanut oil for
just a few minutes.

Filling Sausage

meats, makemeat

1 x no ingredients

Sausage meat should be finely ground, as it keeps and holds together
better.  Beef alone, or pork alone can be used, but better two-thirds fat
and lean pork, and one-third beef.  Vary the seasoning by using pepper,
onions, sage, nutmeg or cloves--the latter two are not very common. For
filling the skins a piece of bone 2 or 3 inches long is most serviceable,
but a piece of tin, shaped into a funnel, smallest end a trifle smaller
than skins, will do very nicely.  Insert this funnel into one end, hold in
left hand, and proceed to fill, using the thumb to force the meat down.
Prick the casings often with a hatpin, to let out any air. To have a change
make some with cooked barley and with potato (raw), finely choppped or
ground.  Use the proportion of 1/4 of barley or potatoes. This is fine.

Garlic-Stuffed Leg Of Lamb With Cabernet Sauce

lamb

1  leg of lamb, about 5 to 6
1  lb., boned

2-3     c  Cabernet Sauvignon
6-8     lg heads fresh garlic, broken
:          into cloves, unpeeled
1-1/2   T  finely minced fresh rosemary
1-1/2   ts anchovy paste
3       bn fresh spinach (about 5-6
:          cups tightly packed)
1-2     ts arrowroot
1       T  whole fresh rosemary leaves,
:          stripped from stem

Remove excess fat and skin from outside of lamb.  Lay meat flat with
boned-out side up.  Make deep gashes in thick areas of the meat so that it
is of consistent height and thickness.  These gashes will also provide
pockets for the stuffing, and meat will cook evenly.  Place meat in a deep
bowl and pour enough wine over to almost cover.  Marinate for 1-2 hours.
Place garlic in saucepan and cover with water.  Simmer 10 mins until
cloves are soft.  Do not overcook!  Drain and rinse with cold water. Cut
off stem end, pinch at bottom and pop cloves out.  Mash garlic into a
thick paste or process in blender.  Add minced rosemary and anchovy paste
and blend well.  Remove meat from marinade, reserving marinade liquid.
Lay meat flat with uncut side down and spread paste evenly over inside and
down into pockets.

Wash spinach; remove stems and coarse ribs.  Place in a nonstick pan and,
using only the water left clinging to the leaves after washing, cook over
high heat, covered, for 1 minute.  Turn as necessary to evenly wilt
spinach.  Remove excess water by squeezing.  Distribute spinach evenly
over pate-covered meat surface.  Roll lamb into roast form and truss with
twine in 1 inch pattern.

Spread excess garlic mixture that may ooze out during trussing over
exterior of finished rolled meat.  Roast in preheated 500 degree oven for
10 minutes to sear outside of lamb.  Reduce heat to 325 degrees for 10
minutes per lb.  Allow lamb to "set up" for 15 minutes before carving.

Meanwhile, place marinade in saucepan and heat over medium heat until
sauce is reduced by half.  Skim if necessary.  Thicken with arrowroot
which has been dissolved in cold water.  Add whole fresh rosemary leaves,
reheat and serve with sliced lamb.

Ginger-Fried Beef

beef, chinese

1/4 lb sirloin steak, shredded
1 medium onion, quartered and cut into strip; s
1  thumb-size piece fresh ginger, peel; ed and
1  shredded   (see note)
1  clove garlic, minced
1  marinade (in jar)
2 teaspoon light soy sauce
2 teaspoon vegetable sauce
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon dry sherry or rice wine
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water

NOTES: Thanks to reader Alice Ho, here's a ginger beef recipe that's
stir fried not deep fried. If you partially freeze the beef, it can
be cut into thin shreds making it quick work in a wok or wide
skillet. Marinating the meat and cooking it, still partially frozen,
keeps more of the meat juices in the meat and out of the sauce. For
dessert, a tropical mixture of lichees, mandarins and grapes would be
refreshing. If you thought soy sauce was soy sauce, Alice Ho offers
these tips : "Black and light soy sauces are distinguishable. If you
shake the light sauce, the bottle is transparent. This is easier than
deciphering the chinese characters on the bottles." Ho says the
baking powder in this recipe acts as a meat tenderizer.

DIRECTIONS: Cut beef into shreds, while partially frozen. Use a sharp
cleaver or chef's knife.  Prepare onion, pepper, ginger and garlic;
set aside.

Pour marinade ingredients (mixed together) over beef and let stand
for 30 minutes (longer if you wish).

Heat wok or wide skillet; add 2 Tb vegetable oil.  Fry onion and
pepper in hot oil, stirring constantly.  Add salt and pepper to
taste, and cook for a minute. Vegetables should be crisp and
glistening. Remove from pan.

Add another 2 Tb oil to the pan; heat and add garlic and ginger.

Add beef, stirring quickly to separate strips that cling together.

Add 1/4 cup hot water; stir and cook for about a minute. Return cooked
vegetables to wok and blend quickly.

Season to taste, as you wish, or add 1 Tb oyster sauce to enhance the
flavor.  Serve over hot steaming rice. Serves 2. Offer a second
stir-fry dish to round out the meal.

450 g/1 lb shortcrust pastry 1 egg white, beaten until liquid 450 g/1 lb
boned breasts of chicken, pigeon or wild duck and/or saddle of hare or
rabbit (not stewing meat) Salt and black pepper 450 g/1 lb minced beef 2
tablespoons shredded suet 3 hard-boiled egg yolks, crumbled Spice mixture
made with 1/4 teaspoon each ground cinnamon and mace and a pinch of ground
cloves 25 g/1 oz stoned cooking dates, chopped 25 g/1 oz currants 50 g/2 oz
stoned prunes, soaked and drained 125 ml/4 fl oz/ 1/2 cup beef stock 1
tablespoon rice flour or cornflour

No Christmas feast in medieval times was complete without a 'grete pye'. In
some recipes, it could contain many varied meats, but quite often only two
or three different kinds were suggested; change the meats suggested here if
you wish.

Use just over half the pastry to line a 23-cm/9-inch pie plate. Brush the
inside with some of the egg white.

Skin the pieces of breast and other meat if necessary and parboil them
gently in salted water for 10-15 minutes.  Drain and leave to cool. Mix
together in a bowl the minced beef, suet, salt and pepper to taste, the egg
yolks and half the spice mixture.  Add the rest of the spices to the dried
fruit in another bowl.  Slice the parboiled meat. Pre-heat the oven to
220C/425F/Gas Mark 7.

Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of the beef stock to the rice flour or cornflour in
a small saucepan and cream them together; then add the remaining stock and
stir over gentle heat until slightly thickened. Keep aside.

Cover the bottom of the pastry case with half the mince mixture. Arrange
the sliced meat in a flat layer on top.  Scatter the chopped spiced fruit
over it and cover with the remaining mince.  Pour the thickened stock over
the lot.

Roll out the remaining pastry into a round to make a lid for the pie. Brush
the rim of the case with a little more egg white and cover with the lid.
Press the edges to seal, and make escape slits for steam. Decorate with the
pastry trimmings and glaze with egg white.  Bake for 15 minutes, then
reduce the heat to 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 and bake for 45-50 minutes longer.

Serves 6 to 8.

Gyros  *** Kjnx92a

lamb, greek

2 lb beef; or lamb
4 each green onion; finely chopped
1 each cl garlic; minced
1 teaspoon oregano,
1/4 teaspoon cumin,
1/4 teaspoon parsley
1 teaspoon salt,
1/4 teaspoon pepper; freshly ground,
8 each lg pita

(recipe follows).  Mix all ingredients except pita, mixing well and
kneading until m;ixture is stiff.  On skewer pack meat mixture about
5" long and not more than 2" in diam. Put as many "fingers" as
possible on a skewer leav- ing a 1" space in between.  Cook over hot
coals o 10 to 15 mintues,  turning frequently.. Take pita and slide
gyro onto center. Drizzle with sauce.  Fold over to eat SAUCE:   Mix
together 1 cup yogurt, 2 Tbp. mayo,  juice of 1 lemon, 2 scal- lions
incl. green tops, finely chopped. I have another recipe that gives
the following for the meat mixture:   2# lean ground lamb,  2  slices
homemade gread toasted and crumbled; 1 tsp. crushed allspice, 1 tsp.
crushed corian- der seed1 clove pressed garlic; 1 grated onion; 1
tsp. chopped fresh savory; salt and freshly ;ground pepper.   This
latter recipe also suggests wrapping the "fingers" on the skewer with
sliced bacon. If anyone tries this, let me know how it works out. I
have this frequently in Greece and here in the U.S.,  but as I have
said, I view it as a "deli" item. Krinos Foods has a "gyros kit" that
is sold in the frozen food section of some supermarkets. FROM:    C

Haggis (Mock)

beef, ethnic

1/2 lb liver; 225 grams
1/2 lb beef, minced; 225 grams
2 medium onions
6 oz oatmeal, medium; 175 grams
6 oz suet; shredded; 175 grams salt
1 pinch nutmeg; grated water; 50 ml appro
1 pinch cayenne pepper

"Haggis, "The great Chieftain of the pudding' race", as Robert Burns,
described it, is indeed a toothsome morsel and it is a great pity
that many English people look upon it as more a Scottish joke than a
good Scottish dish. However since Haggis is made from the stomach,
lungs and other internals of a sheep it is a rather gruesome sight
during certain stages of its cooking, as anyone who has witnessed the
process will agree. The lung must be first be heating in a pan of hot
water with the trachea hanging over the side to allow any blood and
froth to escape and the stomach bag must be cleaned and scraped very
thoroughly before it is used. I must say from experience that it
takes needs a fairly robust stomach to first prepare and then eat it.
If you can buy prepared haggis I do strongly recommend you to try it.
All you need to do is slice it and fry it in a lightly greased frying
pan. If you cannot buy ready-made haggis, then the following is tasty
substitute.."

Boil the liver for five minutes. Drain and put aside to cool. Toast
the oatmeal in a dry frying pan or in the oven until it begins to
turn a pale brown. Peel and mince the onions and the liver. Mix all
the ingredients with the seasoning and stir in some of the water in
which the liver has been boiled. The mixture should be thoroughly
moist but not wet. Have ready a greased basin large enough to give
the mixture room to swell. Cover with greaseproof paper and a cloth
and boil or steam for three hours. The traditional way to serve
haggis is with mashed potatoes and turnips - "tatties and neeps", as
they are called in Scotland - and to give the meal a truly Scottish
flavour you should serve a glass of whiskey along with it. I like to
let the mock haggis go cold and then slice it and heat it through in
a frying pan (without fat) until golden brown on both sides. This way
it is very good with poached eggs and even with chips.

Note: if your mince looks to be on the fatty side, then cut down the
quantity of suet to 4 oz (100grams).

12 oz soup noodles

Put all of the meat into the soup pot and add the peppercorns, nutmeg,
bouillon cube, and salt. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Clean
the vegetables, discarding seeds and tops, except for the parsley
root, the leaves of which should be used. Cut into large even chunks.
After the meat has simmered for an hour, add the vegetables and cook
gently for another hour or until both meat and vegetables are done.
Cook the noodles separately and drain. To serve the meat Hungarian
style, spoon noodles into soup bowls, and spoon broth over them for
the soup course. The meat and vegetables should be served with crusty
black bread as the entree. Hearty Hungarian Peasant Soup

1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon cilantro powder
3 tablespoon sugar
1 lb thinly sliced sirloin
2 cup oil for deep frying

Home-Cured Corned Beef

beef, makemeat

4 lb beef roast
4 tablespoon curing salt
6 each garlic cloves, peeled
3 each bay leaves
1/8 teaspoon whole cloves (3)
2 tablespoon whole coriander seeds
2 tablespoon whole peppercorns
1 tablespoon whole mustard seeds
1/4 cup brown sugar

Combine garlic, bay leaves, cloves, coriander seeds, peppercorns, and
mustard seed in blender.  Blend until coarsly chopped.  Add brown sugar.
Set aside.

Trim roast (venison, beef, etc.), weigh and measure 1 level Tablespoon of
curing salt per pound.  Add measured curing salt to spice mixture you set
aside.

Rub spice mixture into roast, pressing in well. Measure roast at thickest
point.  Place into heavy freezing bag and close securely. Place in shallow
pan in refrigerator.  Cure 5 days per inch of measured thickness, turning
bag daily.

At end of curing time wrap and freeze.

To cook:  Drain juices, if desired rinse thoroughly under cold running
water to remove extra salt and spice pieces, wrap in foil and bake sealed
at 300 degrees 2 to 3 hours or until tender.  Or use in any corned beef
recipe.

Dorothy's comments: This recipe has been tested by my whole family on both
beef and venison with the results that if I do not have one either in
process or residing in the freezer ready for instant cooking I certainly
hear about my oversight!  It has become the most requested top of the list
for both Birthday and Christmas giftlists. For ease in converting the ratio
of meat to spices I have set my serving size to the most often used size of
roast by my family.  I have used this on several different cuts of meat,
however, our favorite is bottom round. Recently I became lazy and instead
of grinding the spices in my blender I left them whole. The result was
exactly the same in flavor and since I hate to bite into a spice by mistake
and rinse them off before I cook the corned beef, it made the rinsing task
a whole lot easier! I haven't tried using brisket myself, however since
that seems to be the only cut of meat that you can get as corned beef in
the supermarkets around where I live, I imagine it would work fine.
Actually, avoiding brisket was one reason I decided to corn all my own meat
at home! IMHO briskets "might" make good doorstops! Seriously though, the
main reason we don't care for brisket is only because mostly it has a high
amount of fat. The corning process does such a good job of tenderizing that
there is no problem with the toughness. Our favorite cut of meat to corn is
the bottom round since it seems to be a leaner cut of meat. Usually I just
cook the corned beef in the oven with a few potatoes, carrots and celery
with it.  Or my husband likes to wrap it in foil and cook it on the
barbecue grill, unwrapping and browning it the last 15 to
20    minutes of the cooking time.

Sylvia's comments: on brisket, it produced a very flavorful corned beef,
usable after about 12 hours in the crockpot.

Homemade Pizza (Pinnacle) (2)

meats, pizza, cheese\eggs

1 single recipes follow

SEE HOMEMADE PIZZA (1) FLOUR THE SURFACE YOU WILL USE TO ROLL OUT THE
DOUGH. YOU CAN NOT USE TOO MUCH FLOUR. USING A ROLLING PIN, ROLL
DOUGH TO ABOUT 13 - 14" CIRCLE. IT MIGHT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE BUT CAN BE
DONE. PLACE THE ROLLED OUT CRUST ON A GREASED PAN. USE YOUR FINGER
TIPS TO PRESS THE DOUGH TO THE PAN. TRIM OFF EXCESS DOUGH FROM AROUND
THE EDGES AND PUT IT WITH THE REMAINING DOUGH. THICK CRUST: START
WITH A BALL OF DOUGH SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN A BASEBALL. PLACE THE DOUGH
IN THE CENTER OF THE GREASED PIZZA PAN AND WITH YOUR HANDS, PUSH AND
SPREAD THE DOUGH UNTIL IT COVERS THE ENTIRE PAN. DO NOT PUT THE
TOPPINGS ON TO HEAVILY UNTIL YOU GET THE FEEL FOR FLAVOR. COOKING THE
PIZZA: THE BEST TEMPERATURE TO COOK THE PIZZA AT IS AROUND 475 F. IT
ONLY TAKES ABOUT 12 -14 MINUTES TO COOK A PIZZA SO KEEP A CLOSE EYE
ON YOUR MASTERPIECE. AFTER THE PIZZA HAS COOKED FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES
YOU ARE READY TO TEST THE CRUST FOR DONENESS. DO THIS BY LIFTING THE
EDGE WITH A SPATULA. IF THE PIZZA SLIDES IN THE PAN WHEN YOU SHAKE
IT, YOU ARE READY FOR THE LAST STEP. REMOVE THE PIZZA FROM THE OVEN
AND PLACE THINLY SLICED MOZZARELLA CHEESE ON TOP. SLIDE THE PIZZA OFF
THE PAN ONTO THE OVEN RACK. COOK FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. YOU NOW HAVE A
PIZZA WITH A GOLDEN BROWN CRUST AND CRISP.
****************   TIPS FOR PIZZA MAKERS ******************* FOR
THE DOUGH: 1. USE A HEAVY GLASS BOWL RINSED WITH WARM WATER TO LET
THE DOUGH RISE. 2. YOU CAN USE THE DOUGH WITHOUT RISING IF YOU ARE IN
A HURRY. 3. TRY PUTTING SMALL AMOUNTS OF SPICE IN THE DOUGH WHILE
MIXING IT UP. 4. YOU CAN USE WHOLE WHEAT OR RYE FLOUR IN PLACE OF ALL
PURPOSE FOR A
DIFFERENT TASTE. 5. YOU CAN ADD CHEESE TO THE FLOUR TO MAKE A
TASTEY DOUGH. 6. DON'T THROW OUT LEFT OVER DOUGH, IT WILL KEEP IN THE
REFRIGERATOR FOR
MORE TWO WEEKS. MAKE SURE YOU STORE IT IN A LARGE BAG AS IT WILL
RISE
SOME. WHEN YOU ARE READY TO USE THE DOUGH LET IT WARM SOME FIRST.
THE SAUCE: 1. IF THE OIL RISES TO THE TOP WHILE COOKING, SIMPLY STIR
IT BACK IN WHEN
COOKING IS FINISHED. 2. YOU CAN USE THE SAUCE WHILE IT IS STILL
HOT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET IT
COOL FIRST. 3. THE SAUCE CAN BE KEPT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR UP TO
ONE WEEK. TO KEEP
IT LONGER, FREEZE IT! 4. A MIXTURE OF 1 TABLESPOON FLOUR AND 14/
CUP WATER WILL SPEED UP
THICKENING PROCESS. 5. TO INCREASE THE YIELD OR CHANGE THE FLAVOR
OF THE SAUCE, YOU CAN ADD
ANY CANNED PIZZA SAUCE TO THE RECIPES ABOVE. 6. USE CRUSHED SPICES
IN ALL THE RECIPES RATHER THAN POWDERED. 7. YOU GROUND, DRY ONION OR
GARLIC INSTEAD OF FRESH. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE PACKAGE FOR
AMOUNTS TO USE. THE FINAL: 1. IF YOU USE SLICED MOZZARELLA CHEESE YOU
WILL FIND THE SLICE THICKNESS
VARIES GREATLY. YOU MAY NEED TO PLACE THE CHEESE ON BEFORE YOU
SLIDE
THE PIZZA OFF THE PAN, TO KEEP THE CRUST FROM BEING DONE BEFORE THE
CHEESE MELTS. 2. IF THE CRUST IS DONE AND THE CHEESE IS NOT MELTED,
SLIDE THE PIZZA BACK
ONTO THE PAN. 3. IF THE PIZZA IS TO SOFT WHEN YOU SLIDE IT OFF THE
PAN, YOU DID NOT USE
ENOUGH FLOUR. USE MORE NEXT TIME. 4. IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOPPED
CHEESE LEFT OVER, FREEZE IT AS IT MOLDS FASTER
AFTER BEING GRATED. 5. USE LEFT OVER SAUCE IN ANY ITALIAN DISH
CALLING FOR TOMATO TYPE SAUCE.
OR YOU MAY SAVE IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR A GOOD MIDNIGHT PIZZA
SNACK.
*********************  FOR A FAST PIZZA
***************************** YOU CAN MAKE A FAST PIZZA BY USING
TORTILLAS, EITHER CORN OR FLOUR. EVERYTHING ELSE REMAINS THE SAME.
ALL INGREDIENTS GO ON TOGETHER ON A TORTILLA CRUST PIZZA AS THEY COOK

Homestyle Corned Beef & Cabbage

beef

2 cup water
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoon dijon mustard -- divided
1 medium cabbage head -- cut into 8
1  wedges
3 tablespoon butter or margarine --
1  softened
1 1/2 teaspoon fresh dill -- chopped or
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
2 1/2 lb corned beef brisket

Place brisket and water in Dutch oven;  cover tightly and cook 1 hour
at 350  degrees (F).  (  It is very important to simmer the meat
slowly because boiling will cause meat to become tough.) Turn brisket
over and continue cooking,  covered,  1  1/2  to  2 hours, or until
meat is tender. Remove brisket  from cooking liquid and place,
flat-side up, on rack in broiler  pan  so surface of meat is 3 to 4
inches from heat. Combine honey with 1 tablespoon mustard;  brush
half of mixture over top of brisket and broil 3 minutes. Brush with
remaining mixture and continue broiling 2 minutes,  or until  brisket
is glazed. Meanwhile, steam cabbage 15 to 20 minutes,  or until
tender. Combine remaining mustard with butter and dill; spread over
hot cabbage wedges.  Carve brisket diagonally across the grain into
thin slices and serve with cabbage.

Hoosier Poke Sprouts

meats, cheese, seasonings

1  16 to 20 poke sprouts
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon flour
1 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  black pepper; to taste
1/2 cup mild cheddar cheese; grated
12 slice crisp-fried bacon or
4 slice canadian bacon
4  squares buttered toast or
4  english muffins - buttered and toas; ted
1 tablespoon chives; chopped

Gather poke sprouts in the early spring when they are 6 to 8 inches
tall, snapping off the entire stalk with its unfurling leaves above
the ground, as you would pick asparagus.

Clean the poke sprouts and boil them gently in salted water to cover,
until the stalks are just tender. Drain sprouts and keep them warm
until served.

While poke sprouts are cooking, make a white sauce of the butter,
flour, milk, salt, and pepper.  As the sauce thickens, stir in the
Cheddar cheese; continue cooking until cheese is blended.

Have ready and keep warm the slices of bacon, drained well, and the
buttered toast.

For each serving, top a toasted bread slice with 3 slices of bacon
and put 4 or 5 poke sprouts on top. Cover the poke sprouts with
cheese sauce and sprinkle with chopped chives.

Note:  Poke sprouts can be forced indoors in a flat in wintertime. In
late autumn, dig the roots of at least two dozen pokeweed plants.
Chop off each large root about six inches from the crown and plant in
a large, earth-filled box with the crown portions barely covered.
Take the box indoors to the cellar after freezing weather has set in,
and keep it watered.  Or place in a garage or on a porch where the
temperature does not go below freezing, and invert a cardboard box
over the top. In a few weeks, each crown will produce several crops
of blanched poke sprouts which can be cut for use as soon as they
have reached a height of about eight inches. Do not let the sprouts
grow tall enough to develop purple coloring in the stalks. After the
sprouts are cut, another crop will grow.

Use the sprouts in recipes calling for asparagus. Dandelions and
chicory can be forced by the same method. The blanched greens are
very tender and mild.

Hot Pepper Chicken

meats, poultry, chicken, wok, oriental

2  whole chicken breasts or
4  chicken breast halves
1  salt
1  corn starch
4  fresh hot peppers
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
2 tablespoon soya sauce
1 tablespoon wine
1/2 cup water
1 cup peanuts
2 tablespoon oil

1. Cut chicken meat in sheets away from breast bone, slice into
squares of 1x1". Dredge in a mixture of corn starch and salt on a
piece of wax paper. Allow pieces to dry individually on wax paper
about 20 minutes.

2. Remove seeds from fresh peppers. Coarsely cut into strips. Reserve.

3. Mix sugar, vinegar, soya sauce, wine together in a small bowl.
Reserve.

4. Heat oil in wok until smoking, add dredged chicken, stir fry on all
sides. If oil is hot enough for chicken, pieces will not stick to wok.

5. Add sugar and vinegar reserve, hot peppers. Place cover over wok.
Add 1/2 cup water, cook over medium heat 5 minutes. Self gravy should
form in the bottom of wok. Stir chicken in gravy so it will cook in
gravy. Gravy should become gelatinous after 5 minutes of cooking. If
it becomes too thick, thin gravy out with small amounts of water.

6. Sprinle in 1 cup of peanuts, mix thoroughly.

NOTE: Canned hot peppers are too soft to be used for this dish. If
desired, dried cayenne peppers can be reconstituted for use. If you
are fond of this dish, it is well to freeze your own hot peppers, in
season.

Hot Sesame Seed Beef

meats, skillet, stir fry, wok

      ----MARINADE----
1 tablespoon rice wine
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
5 teaspoon sesame oil
5 teaspoon soy sauce
      ----TOPPING----
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 1/2 teaspoon hot bean paste
1 1/2 teaspoon hoisin sauce
1 1/2 teaspoon oyster sauce
      ----BEEF----
1 teaspoon minced ginger
2/3 lb beef tenderloin flank
1  peanut oil (2-4 t)
4  lettuce leaves (or less; use bok-choy if you can g

Mix together all of the marinade ingredients.  Slice the beef across the
grain into thin, diagonal pieces (about the size of your smallest finger).
Marinate for about half an hour.

Heat the wok until a drop of water dropped into it dances around as it
boils. Add enough oil to coat the wok and saute the ginger. Stir-fry the
lettuce. Stir-fry the beef (in batches so the wok doesn't cool down too
much).

Reduce the heat.  Return the vegetables to the wok.  Add the topping. Stir
around until everything is mixed and heated evenly.  Serve.

NOTES:

*  Very hot, very simple, very good beef stir-fry -- This recipe has been
floating around for years back east, where it's also known as Hot Flaming
Death.

*  Also add any other vegetables that you feel like.  Sliced carrots or
broccoli are especially nice.

*  Hot bean paste also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc. This is
the main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care. Vary this
ingredient to taste.

: Difficulty:  easy.

2 oz raw lean beef, in
1  matchbook-cover sized
1  pieces
2 oz raw chicken, in small pieces
1  any which shape
2 oz raw shelled shrimp (cooked
1  will do)
2 teaspoon dry sherry
2 teaspoon cornstarch
4 tablespoon oil
2 oz button mushrooms, sliced
1  (reconstituted chinese ones
1  are better but
1  are quite expensive)
2 cup chinese cabbage, shredded

1  cabbage, blanched)
2  scallions, cut into
1  matchsticks (green and white
1  part both, no roots)
2 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon msg (substitute chicken
1  bouillon granules)
1/4 lb raw bean sprouts

(this an adaptation of Joyce Chen's recipe) I was served half of this as a
"half order" for $4.65, and it was too much, so I suppose it makes enough
for about 3 as a main course

Bring a lot of water to the boil. Dump noodles in; turn heat to low. Cook 3
minutes. Drain, toss with sesame oil and regular oil, set aside.

In 4 separate dishes, combine each of the meats with 1/2 t sherry and
1/2 t  cornstarch.

Heat the 4 T oil in a skillet or wok to high. Add meats in this order,
stirring for a few seconds between each addition: pork, beef, chicken,
shrimp. As soon as you've added and tossed the shrimp, add the mushrooms
and cabbage. Cook until cabbage is wilted. Add scallions, soy, salt, and
MSG. Stir. Add the noodles and the bean sprouts, and stir-cook for 3 min.
Serve hot on a warm platter.

How To Corn Or Pickle Beef Or Venison

beef

1  text only

Well, with all the talk about the corned beef and how much salt it
has, I dug out the following recipe that was used on the farm to make
"Corn or Pickled Beef Or Venison."

It is best to cut the meat into 4 to 6 lb pieces. Have barrel ready
and spread a layer of salt on the bottom. Rub each piece of meat wtih
a mixture of salt and pepper and pack down in layers, covering each
with a layer of salt.  The top layer should be of salt. Let stand
overnight.

In the morning pour on the following brine: For 25 lbs of meat: 3 lbs
Salt 1/2 t Saltpeter 1/2 c Brown Sugar, Packed Or Molasses 1/2 t
Baking Soda 2 Gals Water

Dissolve the ingredients in 2 gallons water, stir until salt is
dissolved. Test with an egg; if it floats, fine if not, add more
salt. Pour over the packed, salted meat and if necessary, pour on
more water to cover the meat. Invert a dish over itand put a heavy
weight on it, to be sure that the meat will not float. It maybe used
in 2 to 3 weeks. For 100 lbs of meat, double all ingredients.

How To Make "Pulled" Bar-B-Que\Butel

meats

1 x no ingredients

This is how to prepare your meat for delicious pulled bar-b-que. Beef
brisket, beef round roasts and pork shoulders and butts may be used If
cooking the meat in the oven, prehaet to 325. Sprinkle meat with salt
and pepper to taste. Place in a heavy pot. If you intend to go
"stovetop" add 1/2 cup water to the pot and cover tightly with BOTH
foil and a lid. Check meat periodically and add more water as needed.
If cooking in the oven, DO NOT ADD WATER, just seal and place in the
oven. For either method, cook approximately 1 hour per pound, or
until fork tender and falling apart. When meat is done, remove and
allow to cool. Trim any excess fat. For full pulled meat, pull meat
into shreds with your hands or two forks. For partially pulled meat,
pull into 1-inch chunks. Return the shredded meat to the pot and add
your favorite sauce, allowing 1/2 cup per pound. Cook uncovered over
low heat. Submitted By SALLI SCHWARTZ (HONN)

How To Make Jerky

meats, preserving, dehydrating, techniques

1  info

Like other dried foods, meat jerky--tough, leathery strips of dried
meat--was a staple for pioneers and "mountain men" in times past.
Today, beef jerky is still a favorite among backpackers, skiers and
campers--and a popular snack for armchair sports fans, too. Modern
jerky is prepared in an electric dehydrator or oven; sun drying, the
technique favored in pioneer days, presents too great a risk of
spoilage or contamination.

Turkey-breast jerky compared to jerky made with trimmed beef flank
steak, it has less fat.  It also has a more brittle texture, since
poultry is fairly fibrous.

If you like, you can prepared beef jerky with game instead--but it
you do, freeze the meat before drying for at least 30 days or at zero
degrees as a precaution against disease.

The leaner the meat you use for jerky, the better:  a lower fat
content means a longer shelf life.  As a first step for any jerky,
trim and discard all visible fat and connective tissue from the meat;
partially freeze it (to make slicing easier), then cut it into thin
(1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick) strips about 1 inch wide. Cut with the grain
if you like a chewy jerky, across the grain if you prefer a more
tender, brittle product.

Properly dried beef or game jerky should crack, but not break, when
bent; turkey jerky, however, will crack and break.

Once the jerky has been dried, let it cool; then pack it in a rigid
freezer container or plastic freezer bag and freeze for 72 hours at
zero degrees. Then store it in an airtight, insectproof container for
up to 3 weeks in a cool, dark, dry place.  Or, to maintain flavor and
prolong shelf life, refrigerate or freeze.

Hungarian Goulasch (Gulyas)#2+

main dish, meats, ethnic

2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 centiliter garlic
3/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon sweet hungarian paprika
2 lb onions, sliced
1 cup water
2 lb beef (rump, round or chuck)
1  lamb or veal is nice too
1 cup sweet red and green pepper
1  chunks (or peppers of your
1  choice)
1  salt to taste

Crush together the marjoram, caraway, garlic and lemon zest.

In a large kettle, combine the butter (or fat of your choice), 1 tb. tomato
paste, the crushed seasonings and the sliced onions. Saute the onions,
stirring all the while, until the onions are golden. Add the paprika, stir
and saute 30 seconds longer. Add the beef, lamb or veal, (cut in uniform
chunks), the water and salt to taste. Cover the kettle tightly and simmer
for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Add a bit more water during
cooking, only if it is necessary. Just before the goulasch is done, add 1/2
cup more water and let the sauce boil up once more. If more sauce is
preferred, sprinkle it with 1/4 cup flour just before the water is added at
the end and add 1 more cup of water.

Serve the goulasch with speaetzle, noodles or boiled potatoes. Our personal
preferance (and one that is commonly used in Vienna) is zemmel knoedle
(kaiser roll dumplings.)

In Hungary, slivered grteen peppers are sprinkled on this gulyas. It may
also be sprinkle with bits of sweet red pepper.

This recipe was carefully put together by studying several gulyas recipes
and eating many variations of it in Vienna where the Riemermans fell in
love with the dish. You can still play with it as we are as we intend to
keep doing.

The best one I ever had was at the Prater in Vienna. It was lamb, served
with a not so hot long pickled pepper, a large semmel knoedle, and a half a
weiner, mysteriousely cut to look like a swan.

Hungarian Gulyas (Goulash)

main dish, meats, beef

1 1/2 lb beef in 1-inch cubes
1/4 cup green or rep pepper,=
1  chopped
2 cup meat broth
4 slice bacon
1 1/2 cup onions, chopped (3 medium)
1 tablespoon hungarian paprika
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon marjoram
3/4 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup flour
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon hungarian paprika
1 tablespoon water

Set out a Dutch oven, or a electric skillet, or a 3-quart sauce pot
having a tight fitting cover. Prepare meat broth and set aside. Dice
the bacon and place in the skillet or Dutch oven, cook slowly,
stirring and turning frequently, until the bacon is lightly browned.
Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon an put in a small bowl and set
aside.

Add the chopped onion to the bacon fat in the skillet, or Dutch oven
and cook over medium heat until the onion is transparent, stirring
occasionally.  Remove the onion with a slotted spoon to the bowl
containing the bacon and set aside.

Add the meat to the bacon fat and slowly brown on all sides, stirring
occasionally.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon paprika, salt, pepper, and the
marjoram over the meat mixture.

Stir in the bacon-onion mixture with the chopped green or red pepper.
Slowly pour in the meat broth and white wine. Bring to boiling. Reduce
heat, cover and simmer 2 to 2-1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender
when pierced with a fork.  Remove the meat with a slotted spoon to a
heavy serving dish.

Thicken the cooking liquid by pouring 1/2 cup water and 1/4 cup flour
into a screw top jar.  Shake until the mixture is well blended.
Slowly pour one half of the mixture into the sauce pot, stirring
constantly. Bring to boiling.  Gradually add only what is needed of
the remaining flour-water mixture for consistency desired. Bring to
boiling after each addition. Cook 3 to 5 minutes longer.

In a small skillet melt 1 tablespoon butter (or more). Remove from
heat. Blend in 1/2 teaspoon paprika.  Stir in 1 tablespoon water.
Immediately add to liquid in the skillet/and/or/Dutch oven, stirring
untill well blended. Pour the sauce over the meat.  Serve immediately.

Note 1.  Both Germans and Hungarians serve the Gulyas with Spaetzle
dumplings.

Note 2:  You can add any of the following to the receipe.

1    teaspoon caraway seed
1    clove garlic, minced 6 medium potatoes, washed, pared, and
quartered.  Add about 1/2 hour
before the end of the cooking time.

Read my lips:  Use only pure, genuine, authentic Hungarian Paprika.
Without the Hungarian Paprika it tastes like fecal matter.

Mix Bisquick, water and refried beans together and put it in the
bottom of a greased pie plate. Brown and drain seasoned ground beef;
put on top of mixture in pie plate. Add salsa and then cheese. Bake,
uncovered, for 30 minutes at 350 or till golden brown. We have found
if you let it sit for about 15 min, it tends to cut more like a pie.
Serve with extra salsa, sour cream and mexican chips. Can be made the
night before and refrigerated; then put in the oven. (wrv)

Indian Jerky

meats, game, misc, native american, preserves

3 gal water
2 lb dry brown sugar
1 oz saltpeter
1 oz cayenne pepper
1 cup juniper berries, crushed
1  whole piece ginger

Bring water to a boil and add remining ingredients. Boil for 5 minutes.
Remove scum as it appears.  Cool and store in a wooden barrel or
earthenware crock.

Jerky is dried meat, cut in long strips from large game or beef.  To
prepare sun-dried jerky, cut fresh meat into long thi  strips about an inch
wide and an inch thick.  Rub the strips with salt and hang, spaced well
apart on racks, in the sun to dry.  When dry, store in sacks hung in a dry
place.

Jerky can also be made by placing the strips in a corning solution for 3 or
4 days, then hung on racks over a slow burning smoky fire for about 2 days.
The strips should be placed well apart to keep them from touching each
other.  When dry, the strips should be wrapped in a protective covering
such as cheesecloth to keep insects and dirt from settling on them.

Jerky will keep dry as long as it is exposed to the air and smoke. It is
important not to leave it longer than a couple of days.  Then take it down
and store it in air-tight jars or other containers.

1  recipe dumplings

2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

Mash the garlic and saute in the butter. Rub the meat with salt and

an ample supply of gravy.) Cover tightly and simmer for 3 to 4 hours
until the roast is tender. This may be done either in the oven or on
the back of the stove. If you want carrots with the pot roast, add
them to the pot for the last half hour of cooking and for the last 12
minutes of cooking add the dumplings to steam in the flavors of the
pot. When the roast is done, remove it to a hot, round platter and
surround with the dumplings and carrots. Stir the grave until smooth,
correcting the seasoning if necessary. Pour it over the roast; if
fresh dill is available, cut it over the dish with a lavish hand.
Serves 6-8

DUMPLINGS

Sift together the dry ingredients and add the milk gradually. Drop by
the spoonful into the gravy and cook with pot toast or stew during
the last 12 minutes of cooking.

Indonesian Beef

beef

5  red hot chiles; fresh or dri
3  cl garlic
1 medium onion
1  root ginger
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 teaspoon shrimp paste; (optional)
1/2 lb lean beef
1  juice of one lemon
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce; (pref. kikom
1 teaspoon brown sugar
10 fl oz water

Recipe by: Piers Thompson <pjt1@SCIGEN.CO.UK> If you are using dried
chiles then soak them in hot water for 20 minutes. Roughly chop the
garlic, onion and chiles. Peel and chop the ginger and pl in a
liquidiser (you could probably use a food processor - I haven't
tried) the garlic, onion, chiles, oil and shrimp paste. Blend until a
fine paste adding a little water if necessary (avoid the fumes!).
Cut the beef into f slices about 1/8 inch thick, 1 inch long and 1/2
inch wide.

Heat a non-stick frying pan and add the paste.  Fry for 3 minutes and
then the beef.  Fry until the meat is browned all over. Add half the
lemon juic the soy sauce, sugar and water. Stir, reduce the heat and
simmer for 20-30 minutes until the beef is tender. Taste and add
extra lemon juice if requi Add more water if necessary during
cooking. The sauce should be quite thic when the meat is cooked.

Serve with rice or noodles and quick fried cabbage with eggs (see
recipe).

Notes:  Vary the number of chiles depending on what sort of chile you
are u and how hot you like it.  It is supposed to be very hot. I have
also made using left over roast beef and reducing the simmering time
to 10 minutes.

1  peanut curry sauce
1/2 cup plain non-fat or low fat yogurt
2 tablespoon cream of coconut
2 tablespoon creamy peanut butter
1/4 teaspoon curry powder

Allow at least 3 hours to marinate the beef.

Initial preparation: Partially freeze beef flank steak to firm. Soak
12-10" bamboo skewers in water at least
10    minutes.

Combine all above ingredients except the beef and peanut curry sauce.

Cut steak slices diagonally against the grain into 1/8 inch thick
slices. Place beef slices in the marinade you made earlier, place in
refrigerator 3 to 4 hours. Turn occasionally.

Prepare peanut curry sauce as follows: plain non-fat or low fat
yogurt, cream of coconut, creamy peanut butter, curry powder, and
grated fresh ginger.

Remove beef from marinade, place meat, pineapple, cucumber chunks,
green onion tops, and red bell peppers on skewers as desired.

Place the skewers with meat and other stuff on it, on the grill, it
should have medium hot coals. Stay close, this doesn't take long. Turn
occasionally and brush with the marinade sauce that you used earlier.
Remove from fire when meat is done to your taste.

Push the meat, etc. from your skewer to your plate. Spoon peanut curry
sauce over it, AND ENJOY!!!

This recipe requires no additional side dishes, but from experience I
can give you a strong hint, finish it off with ice cream, and a
bottle of good Port wine. Trust me ... Submitted By

Iowa Chop With Apricot Pecan Stuffing

main dish, meats

1  posted by stewart hopper
1  stuffing mixture:
8 oz dried apricots
1/3 cup brandy
2/3 cup hot water
1/2 cup onion, minced
1/2 lb unsalted butter
12 oz broken pecans (not chopped)
1 tablespoon fennel seed
1 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon nutmeg
2 oz dried currants
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
1/4 cup apricot jam
1  5-6 whole eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 lb packaged seasoned bread stuffing cr; umbs
1  pork:
12  6-8oz iowa chops
1  3 to 4 tb vegetable oil
1  optional flambe:
1 cup brandy

Soak apricots in brandy and water for 1/2 hour. Drain, reserving
liquid, and chop apricots finely. Place together in a large bowl.

Saute onions in butter until tender. Add to apricots and reserved
liquid; set aside to cool slightly.

Add remaining stuffing ingredients (except the bread stuffing crumbs)
in order given. Mix well to break up the eggs.

Add bread crumbs and mix well.  Refrigerate stuffing while preparing
pork.

Make a pocket in the meat by slicing horizontally toward the bone
halfway up the thickness of the chop. Stuff each chop with about 1/3
cup of the prepared stuffing, then sear both sides of the chop in a
skillet with the vegetable oil in it.  Arrange the chops in a baking
pan, cover, and bake for 35-40 minutes in a 350 degree oven. (when
pork tests 160 internally, it is done)

There will be about 2 quarts of stuffing left, which should be served
as a side dish. Place it in a greased baking dish and bake uncovered
in the oven with the pork.

Heat brandy in a small saucepan until hot but not boiling. Pour hot
brandy into the hot baking pan with the meat, then touch with a
lighted match. The brandy will flame up, and at this point you can
carry the meat dish to the table and place it on a heavy trivet. The
flames will subsidde after a minute or so, but the baking dish will
be too hot to pass, so the chops must be served by the host or
hostess.

Irish Clear Lamb Stew

main dish, meats

2 1/2 lb lamb:  neck chops
4 each medium-sized onions
4 each medium-sized carrots
1 single salt and pepper
1 tablespoon lamb fat
1 tablespoon butter
2 1/2 cup stock or water

Don't let the butcher trim the fat off the lamb chops! Shred some of
it and render it down in a heavy casserole. Peel onions and potatoes,
scrape carrots. Cut the meat into 8 pieces; only excess fat is cut
away. Bones need not be removed.  Cut the carrots and onions in
quarters. Toss the meat in the hot fat until its color changes;
repeat with onions and carrots. Add stock and season carefully.  Put
whole potatoes on top. Simmer gently until the meat is cooked,
approximately 2 hours. Pour off the cooking liquid: degrease it, and
reheat in a saucepan.  Check seasoning. Then swirl in butter, chives,
parsley, and pour back over stew.

Irish Pot-Roasted Chicken

main dish, meats, poultry

1 single chicken, about 4.5 lb
4 oz oatmeal
1 single medium onion, chopped
2 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon stock
1 single salt and pepper
6 oz bacon
3 single med. onions, sliced
2 lb potatoes
1 single seasoned flour
3 tablespoon dripping or oil
4 single med. carrots, sliced

If there are giblets with the bird, take them out, wash all but the
liver (reserve that for another use), and cover with water, add salt
and pepper, bring to the boil and simmer for half an hour. Wipe the
bird inside and out and remove any lumps of fat from the inside;
sprinkle with salt. Mix together the oatmeal, chopped onion, butter
or suet, stock, and seasoning, stuff the bird with this mixture and
secure well. Heat the dripping or oil and lightly fry the bacon, then
chop and put into a casserole. Quickly brown the bird in the same fat
and put on top of the bacon. Soften the onion and briefly saute the
carrots, then add to the casserole. . Strain the giblet stock and
make it up to about 1/2 liter. Heat and pour over the chicken.  Cover
and cook in a moderate oven (350C) for about an hour. . Meanwhile,
cut the potatoes into thick slices and blanch them in boiling water,
or steam them for about 5 minutes. Toss them in seasoned flour and
add them to the casserole, adding a little more of the giblet stock
if needed.  Cover with buttered wax paper and continue cooking for
another 1/2 hour, taking off the paper for the last few minutes for
browning.

Irish Stew (2) [biddy Whyte Lennon]

main dish, meats

1 1/2 lb stewing lamb or mutton
2 single large onions
3 lb potatoes
1 single large bunch fresh parsley
2 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 single water
1 single salt and fresh black pepper

Peel the onions and slice them into rounds.  Peel the potatoes as
thinly as possible.  Leave them whole unless they are very large. Cut
the meat into good-sized pieces.  Small chops can be left whole,
larger ones divided in two.  Place a layer of onions on the bottom of
a heavy casserole, and the meat on top of them. Sprinkle chopped
thyme and parsley generously, and season well.  Layer the rest of the
onions with the potatoes. Sprinkle thyme and parsley again at the
last. The amount of water you need to add depends on how good the
seal is between your pot and its lid, and whether you like a "wet" or
"dry" stew. You will certainly not need more than two cups, and I use
barely one. Bring the water to a boil, cover as tightly as possible,
and place in a preheated oven at 300F for 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Keep an
eye on it towards the end, and adjust the gravy by adding a little
water if you think it too dry.  A good stew should have some gravy,
but should not be flooded by it. "Floury" potatoes will dissolve into
the gravy, "waxy" ones will not.  I tend to use a mixture.  Serve
very hot with more fresh chopped parsley sprinkled on top. White soda
bread to mop up the gravy.

Italian 8-Layer Pie

main dish, meats, vegetables, cheese

      ----CRUST----
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cold butter or margerine,
1  cut into pieces
1  egg
1  egg white
2 tablespoon milk
      ----FILLING----
1 large red sweet pepper, roasted
1 pkg 10-ounces frozen chopped,
1  spinach thawed
1 large fennel bulb, trimmed and
1  coarsely chopped (1 cup)
2 medium leeks, thinly sliced, 2/3 c.
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup ricotta cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella (4-oz.)
1/4 cup pesto or homemade pesto
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1  egg yolk
4 oz salami, coarsely chopped
1  (3/4 cup)
1  beaten egg yolk

TO MAKE DOUGH in the food processor, place the steel blade in the
processor bowl.  Add flour, cold butter, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
Process with serveral on/off turns till mixture resembles coarse
cornmeal. combine egg, egg white, and milk; add to processor and
process till mixture forms a ball. (Or, for the mixing bowl method,
combine flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium mixing bowl; cut in
butter till mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add egg mixture; mix
with a spoon or your hands till mixture forms a ball.) Cover dough;
chill while preparing filling.

FOR FILLING, cut roasted sweet pepper into strips; set aside. Drain
spinach squeezing to remove excess liquid. In a 10-inch skillet cook
fennel and leeks in hot oil for 5 to 7 minutes or till tender. In a
mixing bowl stir together drained spinach, ricotta, mozarella, pesto,
Parmesan, the first egg yolk and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.

ON A LIGHTLY FLOURED SURFACE roll 2/3's of the chilled dough into a
12-inch diameter circle.  Place the dough in an 8-inch sprinform pan
(the dough will go about 2-1/2 inches up the sides). Press pleats in
dough as necessary to fit.  Spread the bottom crust with half of the
fennel mixture. Top with half of the spinach mixture, half of the
salami, and half of the red pepper strips. Repeat layers.

ROLL REMAINING DOUGH into an 8-inch circle; place atop filling. (You
may want to save a few dough scraps for decorating the top of the
pie.) Fold excess bottom crust over top crust; crimp edge to seal. If
desired, cut reserved dough scraps into shapes and use to decorate
the top of the pie. Or, cut a design, such as a leaf or a flower, out
of the top. (If you don't cut a design out of top crust make a few
slits in the top crust to let steam escape while baking.)  Brush with
remaining egg yolk. Bake in a 375-degree oven about 50 minutes or
till golden. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove sides of pan to
serve.  Serves 10 to 12.

TO BAKE AND CHILL AHEAD: Bake pie as directed; cool. Chill pie in pan
about 1 hour.  Remove from pan, wrap in foil, and chill for up to 2
days. Before serving, heat wrapped in foil, in a 350-degree oven for
50 to 55 minutes or till heated through.

TO BAKE AND FREEZE AHEAD: Bake pie as directed; cool. Chill pie in pan
about 1 hour.  Remove from pan, wrap in foil, and freeze for up to 1
month. To serve, thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Heat, wrapped in
foil in a 350-degree oven for 50 to 55 minutes.

Italian Sausage & Peppers In Tomato Sauce

meats, pasta, italian

2 lb hot and mild italian sausage
3 large green bell peppers
1 large red bell pepper
1 large gold bell pepper
1/2 lb fresh sliced mushrooms
1  clove garlic, minced
4 lb jar ragu spaghetti sauce
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  oregano to taste
3 tablespoon minced dry onion

Remove the casings from the sausages.  In a Dutch oven brown the
sausages, then slice the sausages into 1/4" slices. Add the Ragu
sauce to the pot. Remove the stems and seeds from the bell peppers.
Cook the peppers for 10 minutes on high setting in the microwave or
you can just add the peppers to the pot if you plan on letting the
mixture simmer for awhile before serving.  Add mushrooms, peppers,
garlic, onion, salt and pepper. Heat the mixture over low heat and
simmer as long as you can. About 15 minutes before serving, heat a
large pot of water to boiling and cook your choice of pasta,
preferably a large size pasta or macaroni to al dente. When ready to
serve, add the cooked and drained pasta to the sausage and pepper
mixture and enjoy.  This is a great way to have sausage and peppers

Italian Style Dry Sausage

makemeat

8 lb lean pork, cubed
2 lb cubed pork fat
5 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
5 teaspoon fennel seed
2 teaspoon anise seed
1 tablespoon garlic, finely minced
2 tablespoon coarse grind black pepper
1 cup dry red wine
1/2 teaspoon ascorbic acid
1 teaspoon saltpeter
6  feet medium hog casings

Grind meat and fat separately through the coarse disk. Mix together with
remaining ingredients. Spread mixture in a large pan, cover loosley with
waxed paper and cure in the fridge for 24 hours. Prepare casings, stuff and
twist into 4" lengths. tie each off with cotton twine. Hang the links 6-8
weeks, checking after six weeks by cutting in half. If the texture is firm
enough to suit your taste, the remaining sausage may be cut down and
wrapped tightly for storage in the refrigerator. Prolonged drying will
result in a sausage that has the texture of something like beef jerky, at
which time you can either gnaw on it like a dog with a bone or use it to
club intruders.

James Beard's Lamb Shanks With Beans

vegetables, beef, lamb, beans

2 cup dried beans
3 large onions
3  cloves
1  bay leaf
11  garlic cloves
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup unsalted butter
6 tablespoon olive oil
6  lamb shanks, meaty
1/4 teaspoon rosemary, crumbled
1 1/4 cup beef broth
1 1/4 cup dry red wine
6 slice bacon, lean
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs

Pinto beans, Great Northerns, or pea beans can be used. Pick over the
beans, and soak them in water to cover by 2 inches overnight, changing
water at least one time. Drain. In a kettle, combine the beans with
water to cover by 1-inch and add one of the onions, stuck with the
cloves, the bay leaf, 8 garlic cloves, and salt. Boil the mixture for
5 minutes, and then simmer it, covered, for 25-30 minutes, or until
the beans are just tender. Stud lamb shanks with slivers of garlic
and rub them down with crumbled dried rosemary and salt to taste. In
a heavy skillet, heat 3 Tbsp butter and 3 Tbsp oil over mod-high
heat. Brown the lamb shanks and season them with salt and pepper. Add
the rosemary, broth, wine, and bring liquid to a boil.  Simmer the
shanks, covered, for 60 minutes. In another skillet, cook the
remaining 2 onions, sliced thin, in the remaining 3 Tbsp oil, until
they are lightly browned.  Cook them, covered, until they are
softened and season them with salt and pepper. Drain the beans,
reserving the cooking liquid. Put half the beans in an 8-qt.
casserole, top them with the onions and the remaining 3 cloves of
garlic, chopped fine. Transfer the shanks to the casserole and top
them with the remaining beans. Pour the lamb braising liquid over all
and add enough of the bean cooking liquid to just cover. Top the
casserole with the bacon strips. Cook it, uncovered, in the middle of
a preheated 350f oven for 60 minutes. Sprinkle the top of the mixture
with bread crumbs. Dot with the remaining butter, cut into bits. Bake
the mixture, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes or until the bread crumbs
are golden. a 1970 Gourmet Mag. favorite.

in the meat or by cutting small incisions.

Salt and pepper generously.

Arrange lamb shanks in roasting pan, strew on onion slices, and drizzle
olive oil over all.

Roast in the oven for 25 minutes.

Remove the pan from the oven and sprinkle the lamb with oregano, and
cinnamon then spoon tomatoes onto the lamb, mounding up the tomatoes on
each shank.

Pour the white wine around the meat and return the pan to the oven.

Remove lamb shanks from the pan and set aside.

Add chicken stock to the pan, stirring.

Stir in the orzo.

Arrange the shanks on top of the orzo and baste them with some of the
stock.

Return the pan to the oven.  Cook until pasta is just tender and nearly
all of the liquid has been absorbed (about 15 minutes).

Remove from the oven, cover pan tightly with aluminum foil, and let
stand about 5 minutes.

Serve hot with grated cheese.

beef, snacks

1 lb round steak, cut in strips 4 x1/8; thick
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon worchestshire sauce
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
3/4 teaspoon hot sauce
1/2 teaspoon hickory salt

Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time: 8 hrs Slice
round steak, cut in strips about 4 in. long and 1/8 in. thick. (The
slicing is easier if the steak is partially frozen.) Combine all the
ingredients and marinate in the fridge for at least 8 hrs, mixing
occasionally. Then skewer the marinated strips on bamboo skewers or
toothpicks and hang the strips in the oven with a pan below to catch
the drippings. Set the oven on it's lowest setting (l00-150 F) and
use something to keep the door ajar. The jerky should be dry after
8-10 hours. This was my first time making j erky and the product come
out surprizingly good, but perhaps a bit too salty. You might want to
try low salt soy .

Jim's Yorkshire Pudding

breads, beef, english, puddings

1 3/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk; at room temp.
4  eggs; at room temp.
1 cup water; at room temp.
1  beef drippings or melted suet for t; he pan.

Many Yorkshire pudding recipes in American cook books call for butter
and all milk/no water; that's a Pop-over or something not a real
Yorkshire Pud. This pudding needs no butter or fat in the batter as
there is plenty of beef fat in the pan for flavor. The ingredients
are so simple that the final product is a real surprise to first time
cooks 'cause it's SO GOOD! It used to be the custom in England to
cook the pudding in a tray under the roast and catch all the
drippings. You get a tastier result from making small puddings in
muffin trays in a hot oven after the roast is out as they puff up
more and brown nicely.

In olden days it was served before the roast which would be served
with gravy covered potatoes AND bread to stretch out the meat.
Today's diet conscious hosts would usually serve the puddings with
the roast instead of potatoes and bread.

N.B. The ingredients must be at room temp when mixed to maximize the
puffing effect.

Preheat the oven to 400 F

In a bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Make a well in the
centre and pour in the milk. Stir. In another bowl beat the eggs
until fluffy and then add the water. Beat this mixture into the
batter until large bubbles form. [Let stand up to an hour if you need
to finish the roast.]

Heat the muffin tins in the oven. Pour beef drippings or melted suet
into each muffin hole to a depth of 1/4". It should be hot enough to
sizzle but not smoke. Pour in the batter about 5/8" to 3/4" deep.
Bake at 400 F for about 20 minutes; reduce heat to 350 F and bake
another 10 to 15 minutes. Serve at once with the roast, gravy, and
hot mustard or horseradish.

June Meyer's Authentic Hungarian Liver Dumpli

beef, chicken, hungary, dumplings

4  chicken livers or 2 slices of calfs; liver
1 tablespoon butter
1  egg
1 cup flour
1/2  small onion
1  good sprig of parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt and dash pepper

Great Aunt Miller was my Grandfather Seine's sister. A wonderful
cook, she was a large woman and hard of hearing. It seems like she
was always shouting as though we were the ones that were deaf. But
when she shouted "liver dumplings ready" we were already seated
patiently at the table. We waited for a large bowl of chicken soup,
full of chicken bits, and wonderful liver dumplings. Nothing can
compare with the taste of those fresh parsley and chicken liver
dumplings, cut into the simmering soup. Easy to make, hard to forget.
Regards, June Meyer. Cream butter and egg very throughly. Add flour
till you have a nice dough. You may add a little more flour if
needed. Grate the onion into the dough. Finely chop parsely into
dough. Add 1/2 tea. salt and dash of pepper. Chop liver very fine.
Add liver to dough. Cut into soup with teaspoon when the soup boiling.

Serves 4.

Kathy Pitts Beef Wellington

meats, pitts

2  tenderloin steaks, thick
1  (at least 1 inch, 1 1/2
1  inches is better)
1 pkg puff pastry shells, frozen
1  pepperidge farm
1 can liver pate w/truffles
1  imported
4  mushrooms, fresh; very
1  finely minced
1  shallot (or the white part
1  of 2 small green onions)
1  finely minced
1  butter; clarified, several
1  tablespoons
1  eggs, beaten w/ a tables-
1  poon of cold water

*(chicken or pork liver pate is okay, goose is better, pate de foie gros is
best.)

Heat the clarified butter in a frying pan, and saute the steaks on each
side until well browned (you don't really want to cook 'em, just brown them
).  Remove the steaks from the pan, and chill well. Meanwhile, in the same
pan (add a bit more butter if needed,) cook the mushrooms and shallot until
well browned and dry.  Set aside.

Thaw the puff pastry shells, and, one at a time, roll them on a floured
board until about 1/4 inch thick.  Chill briefly.

Remove one of the rolled pastry rounds from the refrigerator, and place it
in the center of a lightly floured board.  Place half the mushroom/shallot
mixture in the center of the pastry.

Remove one of the steaks from the refrigerator, and spread the top of the
steak with about a 1/4 inch thick layer of pate.  Place the steak, pate
side down, on top of the mushroom/shallot mixture.

Draw the pastry around the sides of the steak, trim off most of the overlap
at the top, leaving maybe a 1/2 inch of pastry on the top side (this is
tougher to explain than to do, but I think you get the picture.) Save the
dough trimmings for later.

Brush the overlapping dough with the egg/water mixture, and place a second
round of dough on top of it to cover the unwrapped portion of the steak.
Cut off the excess. and pinch firmly to join the two pieces.

Turn the whole thing over (pate side up), and refrigerate while you do the
second steak.

After the second steak is done and resting in the refrigerator, preheat
your oven to whatever temperature (425, I think, but I can't remember
exactly) the package of puff pastry shells recommends. While the oven is
preheating, roll the scraps of leftover pastry out, and cut into decorative
leaf, flower or whatever other shapes suit you.

Remove the individual Wellingtons from the refrigerator, brush the top and
sides with egg, cut a couple of decorative slits in each to vent the steam,
and decorate the top with the pastry scraps.  Brush the scraps lightly with
egg to glaze, place the Wellingtons on a baking sheet, and bake until
browned. (Again, refer to the pastry box for timing here, it doesn't take
more than about 20 minutes, though).

Serve, if you like, with a Bordelaise or Maderia sauce on the side. (Knorr
makes decent versions of both ;-)

Kathy Pitts Brisket

meats

4 lb brisket, lean
1  onion, green; cut into thin strips
1  chili peppers, serrano cut into thi; n strips
      ----RUB----
2 tablespoon lemon pepper seasoning
2 tablespoon paprika, sweet
      ----MARINATE----
1/2 cup liquid smoke
1/2 cup worcestershire sauce

I began with a 3-4 lb. hunk of very lean brisket (cut and de-fatted it
myself from a primal cut brisket we'd gotten at a bargain price). Marinated
the thing for 3-4 hours in a mixture of half liquid smoke marinade
(Figaro's) and half Worcestershire sauce, turning occasionally.

I then cut slits in the brisket, and inserted thin strips of green onion
and serrano chili peppers (a trick I picked up from one of the good folks
on the echo).  Rubbed it down very liberally with a mixture of lemon pepper
seasoning and sweet paprika, and wrapped it drug-store style in heavy duty
aluminum foil.

I placed the brisket in a rimmed baking dish (actually a cast-iron skillet)
and cooked it in a preheated 250 degree (F) oven for 16 hours. About an
hour before the meal, I opened the foil package, and grabbed some of the
juices that had formed inside.

Mixed the juices with about the same quantity of catsup, some more liquid
smoke, some garlic powder, a little vinegar, a good-sized shot of Tabasco,
and just a hint of brown sugar, and simmered this whole mess together for a
barbecue sauce.

The brisket was wonderful.  The peppers and onions had melted into the
meat, leaving it nice and moist, and so tender it could be cut with a fork.
The only thing I'd do differently next time is that I believe I'd rouse
myself to build a small, VERY smoky fire with a lot of soaked hickory or
mesquite chips outdoors, and cool-smoke the meat for maybe 30 minutes just
to give it a more pronounced smokey flavor.

I've cooked on a competition barbecue team that managed to place at the
World Championship Barbecue Cook-Off at the Houston Astrodome, and I can
say without reservation, that this was one of the best, most hassle-free
briskets I've yet produced.

Kathy Pitts' Fajitas

mexican, beef

1 1/2 lb beef skirt steak*
1 cup beer
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke
2  lime's juice
2 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce (opt'l)
1 pinch cumin
1 pinch mexican oregano
1  pepper; black or lemon
1  garlic powder

This Tex-Mex favorite was around LONG before the
yuppiefood industry snagged it, and turned it into a
cliche. This is our version of the dish, which is (I
think) pretty close to the original. Our marinade for
this changes from time to time, depending on the mood
of the cook, the contents of the pantry, and perhaps
the phases of the moon, so feel free to fuss with it.

Skirt steak is the diaphragm of the beef, a long very
stringy cut of meat that accounts for the name of the
dish (trans. "sashes"). It used to be dirt cheap, and
was poor folks fare until the food faddists discovered
it.

(Depending on where you live, this cut may either be
easily found at your market, or require a special
order with the butcher.  In a pinch, you could
substitute flank steak, just don't tell me about it
:-) ) To be tender, the meat demands VERY careful
handling.  Arm yourself with a small, sharp knife, and
obsessively trim off ALL the fat, and as much of the
silvery membrane surrounding the exterior of the meat
as you can manage. This can take a while, but be
persistant. The more you trim, the better the finished
product.

Place the meat in a deep non-metallic pan, and cover
with a mixture of the remaining ingredients.  Marinate
the meat, turning occasionally for at least 2 hours
(overnight is better). When the exterior of the meat
is grey, it's ready to cook.

The soy is NOT authentic, but since Ninfa's, the
Tex-Mex restaurant chain that originally popularized
the dish uses it in THEIR marinade, I sometimes do,
too. It gives the finished dish a nice shiny glaze.

To cook, fish the meat out of the marinade, and dry
well.  Season the exterior with a liberal quantity of
cracked black pepper (lemon pepper is good, too), and
garlic powder (not salt).

Grill over a medium-hot charcoal fire (best), or broil
or grill indoors. Either way, be VERY careful not to
overcook the meat.  If you cook skirt steak beyond
medium rare, it will be the toughest cut of meat
imaginable. Since the steak itself is quite thin,
cooking time will be brief. To serve, cut into thin,
slanting slices, carving against the grain of the meat.

The Accompaniments

Fajitas are generally accompanied by sauteed or
grilled onions and sweet green peppers (you can saute
the onions and peppers well in advance, and re-heat on
the grill if you are doing the dish outdoors).

Also served is Pico de Gallo, a fresh tomato based
salsa.

You will also need a stack of the best flour tortillas
you can find. Some refried beans on the side would be
nice, too.

Other possible accompaniments include guacamole or
sliced avocados, lime wedges to squeeze over
everything, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream.

To eat, take a few slices of meat, and lay on a
tortilla.  Top with the sauteed onions and peppers,
pico de gallo, and whatever else suits you.

Fold into a soft taco, and enjoy.

Kathy Pitts' Pot Roast

beef, info

1 x no ingredients

Don't really have a recipe, David, but would you
settle for directions on how to make one?

First select a good-sized hunk of not too tender beef
roast.  A 3-5 lb. hunk of chuck, bottom round or
brisket would be good.  Look for a fairly lean piece
that has at least some fat marbling inside and a light
fat coating on the outside.

Select a covered casserole or Dutch oven large enough
to hold the roast with a bit of room left over.  Place
the cooking pot on the stove, and add enough oil or
fat (rendered bacon fat is good, if not heart healthy)
to the pot to cover the bottom to the depth of about
1/4 inch. Heat the fat over medium-high heat until it
is hot, but not smoking.

Meanwhile, either dry the outside of the roast very
well with paper towels or roll it in flour seasoned
lightly with pepper, maybe some garlic salt, whatever
other herbs seem appropriate.

When the fat is hot, add the roast, and brown well on
all sides. Take your time with this.  You want a nice,
crusty coating, but you don't want to burn it.  Remove
the browned roast from the pan, and set aside.

Add about one cup of chopped onion, 1/2 cup of chopped
celery and 1/2 cup of diced carrots to the fat
remaining in the pan.  Cook, stirring frequently,
until this mixture is nice and brown.  Drain off most
of the remaining fat, leaving the vegetables in the
pot.

Smooth the vegetables out to make a base for the
roast, and add the roast to the pot.  Now add enough
liquid (beef stock, 3/4 beef stock plus 1/4 dry red
wine, tomato juice, whatever you feel like) to come
about 1/4 inch over the bottom of the beef.  The
amount of liquid you need (don't use too much or the
beef will boil instead of braising) will depend on the
size of the pot and the size/shape of the roast.

Cover the pot, and either simmer on top of the stove
over very low heat, or place it in a preheated 325
degree oven.  Either way, check the roast every half
hour or so, turning the meat occasionally, and adding
more liquid as needed.

After an hour or so, you can add small whole peeled
carrots, peeled potato halves or whatever other
vegetables appeal to you to the roast. If you do this,
tuck the vegetables around the side of the roast so
they sit in the liquid.

Cooking time will depend on the cut of beef, and the
tenderness of the meat, but you can count on at least
2-2 1/2 hours.  The meat is done when a large cooking
fork can be inserted easily.

At this point, remove the meat and vegetables (if
used) to a serving platter and keep warm.

Pour the liquid remaining in the pan through a
strainer, into a bowl, pressing down on the strainer
to extract as much of the juices from the chopped
vegetables as possible.

Skim the fat from the surface of the juices, and
return about 4 tbsp. of fat to the cooking pot (do not
wash the pot first, any goodies remaining in the
bottom will add to the flavor of the gravy.)

Add an equal amount of flour to the fat in the pot,
and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour/fat
mixture has turned a nice brown color (about the color
of peanut butter.)  Slowly wisk the reserved cooking
juices back into the flour/fat mixture, adding
additional liquid as needed to make a smooth, not too
thick gravy.  Season the gravy to taste with salt and
black pepper.

Slice the pot roast into fairly thin, even slices, and
cover with a small amount of gravy.  Serve garnished
with the vegetables (if used), and the additional
gravy on the side.

Kathy's Chipped Beef

meats

1 pkg dried beef (i use
1  budding's)
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 tablespoon flour
1 cup milk*
1  salt (it won't need much)
1  white pepper to taste
1 pinch dry mustard

*(for a more authentic military flavor, use canned evaporated milk)

Remove the beef from the package, and tear into shreds. Melt the butter,
and briefly saute the beef in the butter (it should just become slightly
crispy).  Add the flour, and stir until the whole mess congeals slightly
and begins to look a little like wet beach sand (DO NOT brown the flour).

Stir in the milk, and whisk until smooth.  Season to taste with salt,
pepper, and dry mustard.  Simmer briefly until thickened and all the floury
taste is removed.

Serve over mashed potatoes, rice, biscuits or toast.

NOTE:  For a better, but distinctly non-military version of this dish, toss
in a couple of generous handfuls of grated cheddar cheese, and a few grains
of cayenne pepper.

Keith Floyds Spanish Bean & Bacon Casserole

meats, misc

1 e *****

Fry several rashers of bacon until they are crisp.
Drain and keep warm. Then get some good beef sausages
and fry them in the bacon fat. Cut them into slices
and keep warm with the bacon.

Now add some cooked, drained white haricot beans to
the casserole dish and heat the beans through using
the fat from the bacon and the sausages. Return the
bacon and sausage slices to the beans. Then add
**lots** of chopped fresh parsley and sliced fresh
garlic. Stir though and serve at once.

SOME NOTES. Lots of garlic and parsley means about 10
cloves of garlic and a huge handful of parsley chopped
up. Sometimes I will add fresh tomatoes, or maybe a
splurge of fresh tomato sauce, or maybe a nice splash
of Worchestershire sauce.

3/4 lb smoked bacon
2 lb potatoes
1/4 lb mushrooms
1 teaspoon rosemary
1 lb onions
3/4 cup stock
1  salt and pepper
2 oz butter

(Irish pork belly has a fatty layer, vital for the
flavor, and a meaty layer.  See if you can get your
butcher to give you pork that has about equal amounts
of pork and fat. Plain lean pork will not taste as
good.) Cut meat into one-inch cubes. Peel and thinly
slice potatoes. Peel or wipe mushrooms, and slice if
large. Grease a large ovenproof dish with some of the
butter, and place a layer of sliced potatoes in the
bottom. Add half the meat pieces, seasoned and
sprinkled with rosemary. Layer with half the
vegetables, plus another layer of potatoes.  Repeat,
using all meat, veg and potatoes.  Pour stock over and
dot potatoes with remaining butter. Cover and cook in
a moderate oven, 325F, for 2 1/4 hours. Uncover for
the last half hour of cooking to brown the potatoes.

Kielbasa (Barry Strittmatter 1)

meats, makemeat

8 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon sugar
4 teaspoon pepper
4 teaspoon majoram
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon allspice
4 tablespoon garlic
4 lb pork
2 lb pork fat
2 lb beef

Combine pork, fat, and beef.  Add all spices and mix well by hand. Pass
through grinder on course blade.  Stuff into casings. (hint.--After cubing
meat, place in freezer until the center of the meat and fat is firm. This
makes grinding easier in that it lessens the blades from becoming
"clogged")  Most Kielbasa recipes say that the secret to making good
Kielbasa is to ground the meat twice.  I prefer the course texture attained
by a single grinding.  Other sausages I grind twice.

Kielbasa In Spaghetti Sauce..Fkjm22a

appetizers, main dish, beef

1 pkg kielbasa
1 single prego meat flav. spag. sauce
1 single honey

Take Kielbasa and slice into bite size slices. Coat
liberally with spaghetti sauce. Add honey and mix
well. You should use about 1 part honey to 5 parts
spaghetti sauce. Cook on high heat, stirring
frequently, until hot and bubbly. Turn heat down and
simmer for 30 minutes, stirring frequently. May be
cooked on stovetop, in microwave, or in crockpot. I've
tried all three methods and they work equally well.
This makes a very rich tasting dish that can be served
as a main dish or an appetizer.

Kielbasa- Polish Sausage

meats, ethnic

1 1/2 lb pork loin or butt
1/2 lb veal
1  salt and pepper
1  bud of garlic
1 teaspoon whole mustard seed
3 tablespoon water

Remove meat from bones, cut into small pieces and run
through a coarse knife of a food grinder. Add 3
tablespoons of water, pound the garlic, and add the
seasoning. Mix very thoroughly and stuff the casings.
The sausage is then ready for smoking. If you don't
have those facilities, you can boil it for 30 minutes
in rapidly boiling water, or you can place the sausage
in a baking dish, cover with cold water, and bake in a
350F oven until the water is absorbed.

6  egg; hard-boiled, peeled
1  margarine

Mix all the ingredients except the hard-boiled eggs
and the margarine. Put half the mixture into a
well-greased loaf pan (I found that I didn't need to
oil the pan), then put the whole hard-boiled eggs in a
row down the middle of the meat and cover with the
remaining meat mixture.  Dab the top with margarine as
desired:  a lot if the meat is lean, very little if it
is fat.  Bake for 15 minutes in a 500 F. oven, then
reduce the heat to 350 F. for about 45 minutes, until
brown on top.  Serve warm or cold in thick slices so
the egg centers each piece.

The following is a recipe for Korean Short Ribs, Kal
Bi (that's the phonetic spelling I've seen used in
Hawaii and in Korean rest. in U.S. The following is a
recipe for Korean Short Ribs, Kal Bi (that's the
phonetic spelling I've seen used in Hawaii and in
Korean rest. in U.S. Combine all the ingredients into
a pan and marinate up to abt 4 to 5 lbs of beef short
ribs.   Marinate at least 2 hrs, preferably overnight.
Ribs can be  left  whole or they can be English cut
by the butcher or market.    Au- thentic  Korean style
is to slice very carefully and very thinly while
"unrolling" the rib as you go. If done correctly,
you'll end up with a strip of meat the width of the
bone x abt 6" to 9" long of uniform thickness with the
bone still attached by the cartilage or membrane on
the  bone. Grill over hot coals quickly try for medium
rare. Serve with white steamed rice and an oriental
salad or veggie for side dish. It's super easy and
quick.   Good for BBQ w/ friends. And for those that
are lucky enuf to live in Maui, these are availabel
fresh daily at Azeki's Meat Market,  Kihei. People
buy them there and take them home to BBQ for visiting
friends  from the Mainland. They will also pack them
up for you frozen with advance no- tice so you can
take them home with you on the air plane  at   no
extra charge!
We  brought home 20 lbs to SFO and they were no
worse  for  the travel.   I've talked to people that
took them all the way  to  Chicago with no problems.
Last time I was there, a lady from Seattle was
arranging for them to ship 120 lbs, frozen. She was
hosting a dinner party for 45 people and she wanted
some for the freezer for future use. If you've never
tried them, watch for Korean rest. in your area and
try em.You'll like them.   Jim Quon, SF FROM:    JAMES

beef, korean

1 lb sirloin steak
1  clove garlic, crushed
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup sesame or other oil
1/4 cup minced green onions
1  toasted sesame seeds

Thinly slice steak into 1-inch wide strips.  Dip
strips into a marinade made by combining garlic with
rest of ingredients.  Now dip in crushed toasted
sesame seeds to cover the meat completely, and return
to the marinade for an hour.  Weave on bamboo sticks
and broil quickly, or, if you prefer, fry quickly in a
little oil.  (The sesame seeds are toasted by cooking
slowly in a heavy skillet, until brown. They are then
crushed in a mortar or heavy bowl, with salt.  The
mixture should not be smooth.)

Kreplach With Several Fillings

meats

      ----NOODLE DOUGH----
1/2 teaspoon salt
2  eggs; slightly beaten
2 cup flour; unsifted (scant)
      ----CHICKEN FILLING----
2 cup cooked chicken; minced
1 tablespoon onion; minced
1  egg
1  salt and pepper; to taste
      ----CHICKEN LIVER FILLING----
2 cup broiled chicken livers
2  eggs; hard boiled
1  onion; small minced
1  salt and pepper
1 tablespoon scmaltz; chicken fat
      ----MEAT FILLING----
2 cup meat; cooked and ground*
1  egg
1 tablespoon onion; minced
1  salt and pepper
      ----CHEESE FILLING----
2 cup cottage cheese; farmers, dry
3 tablespoon bread crumbs; fine soft
1  egg
2 tablespoon onion; minced
1  salt and pepper

NOODLES: This is a lost art. may I add that I usually
use wonton skins and make life easy for myself; but
once in awhile.... Add salt to eggs,add eggs to flour.
mix with your hands until the dough leaves the sides
of the bowl. It should be fairly stiff. Knead until
dough is smooth and elastic. Roll out on a lightly
floured board (or on a white cloth). Roll and stretch
until it is paper thin...well very thin. Cut into 3"
squares. Place one T of filling in center of each
square and fold to make a triangle. Crimp edges with a
fork and cook in boiling water. If you have a pasta
machine (or I sometimes use FP go for it. Cook until
they rise to the top; about 10 or 12 minutes. DO NOT
COOK IN THE SOUP. You may warm them in the soup.
FILLINGS. These days I zap all the ingredients for
each type of filling in the FP...leaving the eggs for
last. For the cheese filling, you just want to
combine. I would serve all but the cheese with Chicken
Noodle soup. the Cheese Kreplach are usually served on
the side (for a dairy meal) with sour cream. Each of
these recipes makes about 30; figure at least 3 each

L"kdolmar (Stuffed Onion Rolls)

appetizers, main dish, meats

1/2  swedish meatball recipe
3 large onions; yellow (1/2 lb ea); peele
3 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon fresh bread crumbs

Place the peeled onions in a 2 or 3 quart pot, add enough cold water
to cover and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Lower the heat and
simmer the onions, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Remove them from the
pot, drain and let cool on a platter while you make the meat stuffing
(see recipe). Pull off each onion layer separately. They should slide
off quite easily. Cut the largest outer layers of the onions in half,
but remember to leave them large enough to enclose the stuffing.
Discard the inner part of the onions (or use them for some other
purpose) if the leaves are too small to stuff. Put a heaping teaspoon
of the meat stuffing in the middle of each onion leaf and enclose it
by folding over the edges of the leaf. At this poinnt they may be
covered with plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days before
cooking. Preheat oven to 400F. In a shallow flameproof baking dish,
melt 3 tablespoons of butter over low heat. Remove the dish from the
heat and place the onion rolls, sealed side down, side by side in the
butter, first rolling each in the butter to coat it. Bake 15 minutes,
then baste with butter in the dish, sprinkle with bread crumbs and
bake another 15 minutes until the onions are lightly browned and the
crumbs crisp. L"kdolmar may be served as part of a smrgsbord or as
a main dish.

Lamb & White Bean Stew

meats

3 lb boneless lamb stew meat
6 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup diced onions
1  carrot, peeled and sliced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes,
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon rosemary
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoon minced parsley
1 cup dry red wine
2 cup beef stock
3 cup cooked great northern beans

HEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Trim the meat of visible fat and gristle, and
set aside. Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a skillet over medium
high heat. Add the lamb and brown on all sides, being careful not to
crowd the pan; this will have to be done in batches. Remove the lamb
with a slotted spoon, and place it in an oven-proof casserole. Add
the remaining fat to the pan, and saute the onions, carrot and
garlic, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent, about 5
minutes. Scrape the mixture into the casserole with the lamb. Add the
tomatoes, thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper, parsley, wine and stock to
the pan, and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Place the pan in
the center of the oven and bake for 2 1/2 hours, or until the lamb is
beginning to become tender. Add the beans, and bake for 30 to 40
minutes. Serves 6 to 8. (The stew is even better if made a day or two
in advance and refrigerated tightly covered. Discard any fat that
hardens.) Reheat in a 350F oven, stirring occasionally but gently.

2 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  clove of garlic

Cut the meat into 1-inch slices, and put them in an unpunctured

lemon juice, honey, oil and garlic, until the honey has melted. Stir
well and cool to room temperature, then pour over the bagged meat and
leave to stand while you make the salsa. Thread the marinated lamb
onto the soaked skewers. Cook on a preheated barbecue or under a
preheated grill, close to the heat, for a short time. The kebabs are
ready when the outside is brown and the inside pink but not red.

Lamb Cacciatore

meats, soups

4 lb lamb shoulder or leg; trim fat and cut into bit
1/3 cup olive oil
1 small garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon rosemary, dried, crushed
1/2 teaspoon sage leaves, dried
2 teaspoon flour
1/2 cup vinegar (white or wine)
1/2 cup water
1  salt and pepper, to taste

In a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish brown the meat in hot olive oil.
Be careful not to burn the olive oil: it has a lower burning temperature
than other kinds of cooking oil.

Add garlic, rosemary and sage.  Stir.  Sprinkle flour on meat and stir.
Continue cooking the meat while stirring, to brown the flour a bit. Add
vinegar and water.  Stir thoroughly.  Cover, lower heat, and simmer 1 hour
or until meat is tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Stir frequently during cooking, and add a little hot water if necessary to
prevent burning.

NOTES:

*  An Easy Lamb Stew -- I got this recipe from my mom.  I'm not sure where
she got it. It's not a typical cacciatore (i.e. smothered in tomato sauce);
instead, it's tart and tastes of herbs.  It smells great when it's cooking.
It's very easy to make.  Yield:  Serves 4 to 6.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20-30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Lamb Hash Lyonnaise

meats

1/2 cup onions; minced
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 cup tomato sauce; canned
1 cup lamb gravy; (leftover)
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon marjoram
1/8 teaspoon tarragon
1/8 teaspoon dill
1/8 teaspoon thyme
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
3  cooked lamb; (leftovers)

Recipe by: Howard Mann <howard.mann@DEEPCOVE.COM> Saute the onions in
the butter until limp. Add the tomato sauce, gravy, par and
seasonings and simmer, covered, for 5 minutes. Put the lamb through
the fine blade of a meat grinder (food processor  would probably do
the trick) combine with the above mixture. Blend well and transfer to
a lightly oiled baking dish.

If the lamb mixture is not for immediate use,cover, cool, refrigerate
and t freeze. Store up to 1 month) Otherwise, put the dish in a 425
degree oven f 30 minutes while you make 2 cups of mashed potatoes.
Remove the dish, reduc the oven temperature to 350 degrees, top the
lamb with the mashed potatoes, sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons of
grated Romano, Parmesan or Cheddar cheese, return to the oven and
bake for about 20 minutes.

4    Servings.

NOTES: We had a fair bit of roast lamb over after a family Easter
dinner and thoug we would try a "Leftover" recipe. This is what we
did and it made quite an acceptable dinner. The recipe below,which
came from Hazel Meyer's Freezer Cook Book, just invites
improvisation. (For instance, we had no lamb gravy and used some beef
Oxo dissolved in hot water). This may have been done before on this
List but, if not, perhaps we might get some postings on what do do
with leftovers of various kinds of meat? The cook book we have has
other leftover recipes and, if there is interest,we could post them
from ti to time.

Lamb Roast (Traditional Seder Dish)

meats

1  leg of lamb
1  garlic; sliced and chopped
2  chicken soup
2  rosmary sprigs; (preferably
2 tablespoon vinegar
1  juice of 1 lemon
1  paprika
1  black pepper
1  chili peppers

Recipe by: Yaara Di segni <msyaara@PLUTO.MSCC.HUJI.AC.IL> Make a few
cuts in the roast so spices can be inserted in the cuts. Deep cuts
can also be made to facilitate serving.

Put the leg in a baking pan with the spices rubbed all over the
roast. mix the soup with the lemon juice and add about a quarter of
quantity to the roast.

Roast in a preheated oven at 210 (Celsius) for 10 minute and then
turn the meat over. Lower heat to 150 degrees andf keep baking for
about 25 minutes for each kg of meat. Every 10 minutes baste with the
liquids and add someo f the soup&lemon souce. every few times turn
the roast.

The baking times are according to wht's written in the recipe we
have. As our oven doesn't have temperture settings (the oven is 25
years old and the writing on the knob disappeared....) we only
guessed the temperature but yet it came out great. It was the best
dish of the evening and although it looked somewhat overdone from the
outside it was as soft as butter.

Lamb Sans Mint

meats

1  leg of lamb, butterflied and trimme; d
6 tablespoon rosemary
1  black pepper
1  green onions
4 cup burgundy wine
2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup lemon juice
6  garlic cloves, sliced
1 tablespoon oregano
1 tablespoon thyme
1 cup onion, minced

Carefully trimming the fat from a butterflied leg of lamb, and and finish
the cut, as needed, so that the lamb lies flat in a butterfly shape. A
large butterflied leg of lamb should be no more than about 2 or 3 inches
thick.

Take a liberal amount of rosemary, crush it and rub it into the lamb. When
crushing it, don't turn it into dust, just break it.  Sprinkle some black
pepper on the cut side of the meat.

Combine the remaining ingredients (wine, green onions, olive oil, lemon
juice, garlic, oregano, thyme and onion) into a marinade. Place the lamb in
a shallow dish or bowl, cover as much as possible with the marinade, and
marinate in a refrigerator, covered, for 4 to 24 hours. Turn at intervals
to marinate evenly.

Grill over mesquite and charcoal on a grill with a tight-fitting lid, such
as a Weber. Cook on one side for 25 minutes, occasionally spooning some
leftover marinade onto the uncooked side, then turn and cook about 20 more
minutes. cooking. Make a small cut in the thickest part of the lamb to
check for doneness: when the center is still pink, but not raw, take the
lamb off and prepare to serve. Remember that the lamb will continue to cook
after you take it off the grill.

Serve the lamb cut-side down (pretty side up).  Garnish with uncooked green
onions.

NOTES:

*  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- I devised this recipe after being
unable to find an appropriate recipe in the library. It is always well
received, and it looks impressive far out of proportion to its difficulty.
Because it is simple and difficult to screw up, it is perfect as the
centerpiece for a meal with a large group or with complex side dishes.
Serve with a hearty rice pilaf and a vegetable. Yield: Serves 4-6.

*  Your butcher can butterfly a leg of lamb for you.  Tell him you will be
cooking it flat, and not rolling it back up into a roast. Ask him to be

Lamb Shanks & Lentils

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
9  lamb shanks
2 large leeks, chopped
3  cloves garlic, chopped
2  rashers bacon, chopped
500 gm brown lentils
1  sliced carrot
1  stalk celery, sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1  red wine *
1  salt and pepper to taste

* Red wine and water to cover.

Lamb shanks, which cost next to nothing, develop a succulent
gelatinous quality when cooked slowly, and saturate the lentils with
flavour.

In a little olive oil, brown nine lamb shanks (get the butcher to saw
them into pieces) on all sides. Transfer to a large pan. In the same
oil, fry 2 large leeks, 3 cloves garlic, chopped together with 2
rashers of bacon, chopped, until the leeks are soft.

Add the onion and bacon mixture to the saucepan, then add 500 g brown
lentils, a sliced carrot, a stick of celery, sliced, a tablespoonful
of chopped fresh oregano (or use dried) and cover with a mixture of
red wine and water. Do not season at this stage.

Cook very slowly for about 2 hours or until the lamb shanks are very
tender. Check from time to time to make sure the pot does not boil
dry and add more liquid if necessary.

Towards the end of the cooking time, taste and season. Transfer to a
serving dish and scatter liberally with chopped parsley.

Lamb Shoulder In Pastry (Guilainn Chaoireola

main dish, meats, irish

12 oz shortcrust or flaky pastry
3 lb boned shoulder of lamb
6 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon mixed chopped herbs
1  salt and black pepper
1  milk or egg to glaze

Make the pastry and chill for at least 1 hour before using. See that
the lamb is fairly free of fat, and securely tied: put in a roasting
pan and rub with about a third of the butter. Put into a very hot
oven, 450F for 20-30 minutes. Take out and allow to cool slightly. --
Miz the remaining butter with the herbs, salt and pepper. Roll out
the pastry to a piece large enough to wrap around the joint.
Carefully remove the string from the lamb, trying to retain the
shape. Put it in the center of the pastry, dampen the edges, and draw
the pastry up over the top: secure well by squeezing the pastry ends
and edges together. Turn over so that the fold is underneath, and put
on a baking sheet. Prick all over the top lightly with a fork, then
brush with either the milk or beaten egg. Put into 400F oven and cook
for about 1/2 hour, or until the pastry is nicely browned. Turn the
sheet once during baking to make sure the browning is even. Serve,
cut into fairly thick slices.

Lamb Stew With Artichokes

meats

      ----GUY E. ATWOOD----
2 lb lamb
2 each onions
1 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoon flour
1 teaspoon salt
6 each artichokes
1 teaspoon mint leaves
2 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 each onions, chopped
1  eggs
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Cube lamb.  Quarter onions.  In Dutch oven, quickly brown meat and
onions in oil over medium high heat. Lower heat and sprinkle flour
into pan. Stir until well blended. Add salt and enough water to just
cover meat. Simmer, uncovered, until meat is half done.

Prepare artichokes by cutting off tops and removing small outer tough
leaves.  With scissors, square cut each remaining leaf. Place in cold
water to which you have added a few drops of lemon juice. Drain and
stand them on meat.  Chop mint leaves and mix with lemon juice; spoon
over artichokes. Lightly salt. Scatter chopped onions over artichokes
and meat. Cover tightly and simmer until artichokes and lamb are
done, about
12    hours.

Remove artichokes and meat and arrange on platter. Beat egg, add lemon
juice and salt.  Add some broth and mix well. Add back into remaining
broth and cook over low heat until thickened, making sure you stir
constantly. Pour over meat and serve with good ol' Oriental sticky
rice or (God forbid) noodles.

Lamb With Cashew Nut Curry

meats

1/4 cup unsalted cashews
3  dried hot red chilies
2  in piece of stick cinnamon
1  1 in cube fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon cardamom seeds
3  whole cloves
2  large garlic cloves peeled
2 tablespoon poppy seed (white)
1 tablespoon coriander seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
6 tablespoon ghee (or melted butter)
1 cup chopped onion
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unflavored yoghurt
1 1/2 lb lamb cut into 2 cubes
2 tablespoon finely chopped coriander
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup boiling water
1 cup cold water

To make the masala,  combine the cashews,  chilies, ginger and the
cold water  and  blend  at  high speed for 1 minutes. Add the
cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, garlic, poppy seeds, coriander seeds and
cumin. Blend again until the mixture is completely pulverized. Set
the masala aside. Place  the saffron in a small bowl, pour in boiling
water and let soak for at least 10 minutes. In a heavy skillet heat
the ghee over moderate heat until  a  drop  of water flicked into it
sputters instantly. Add the onions and, stirring constantly, fry for
7 or 8 minutes, until soft and golden brown.  Stir in the salt and
the masala, then add the yoghurt. Stirring occasionally, cook over
moderate heat until the ghee lightly films the surface. Add the lamb,
turning it about with a spoon to coat the pieces evenly. Squeeze the
saffron between your fingers, thin stir it and its soaking liquid
into the skillet. Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly, and cook
for  20 minutes,  turning the lamb cubes over from time to time.
Scatter  1/2 of the fresh coriander over the lamb and continue
cooking, tightly covered for 10 minutes more, or until the lamb is
tender. To serve, transfer  the  entire contents of the skillet to a
heated platter, and sprinkle the top with lemon juice and the
remaining fresh coriander.

Lambs' Kidneys Villandry

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
8  lamb kidneys
200 gm minced pork or chicken
1 small egg yolk
1 pinch quatre-epices
200 gm pate de foie
4  rashers bacon
100 ml brandy
100 ml creme fraiche

This is a slightly simplified version of a recipe from the bible of
French cookery, Cuisine et vins de France, by Curnonsky, the French
gastronome and bon viveur born in 1872.

Skin 8 lambs' kidneys, split them in half and core, keeping the
halves in pairs.

Mix 200 g minced pork or chicken with 1 small egg yolk, and a pinch of
quatre-epices (nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and pepper). Have ready 200 g
pate de foie. Remove rinds from 4 rashers of bacon and cut them in
half.

Take each pair of kidney halves and put a thick layer (about 1 cm) of
the mince mixture on the inside of one half and a thick layer of the
pate de foie on the other. Sandwich the stuffed halves together
gently, wrap in half a bacon rasher and secure with one or more
toothpicks. Lay the bacon and kidney parcels in a lightly oiled dish
which can go from oven to top of the stove and bake in a very hot
oven for 10-20 minutes or until cooked through.

Transfer the parcels to a heated serving dish and put the baking dish
on a hot plate. Deglaze the dish With 100 mL brandy and boil hard to
reduce. Thicken with 100 mL creme fraiche or sour cream (or use
evaporated skim milk mixed with a little cornflour), taste and season
if necessary and pour over the kidneys. Serve.

Lean Cooking Tips For Beef

beef, low cal, low fat, hints

1  see below

1. Select lean cuts of beef. 2. Choose closely trimmed CHOICE or
SELECT grade beef cuts. 3. Trim any visable fat from meat before
cooking, and trim inside separable fat after cooking, but before
eating. Research shows that when beef is cooked with outside fat on,
some of the fat liquifies and migrates to the meat. On the average an
additional 9 percent reduction in fat can be achieved by trimming
before cooking. 4. Use cooking methods which do not require
additional fat (non-stick skillets, broiling, roasting on a rack,
grilling and ETC. 5. Reduce oil called for in marinades to 1 teaspoon
per 1/2 cup marinade or eliminate completely.

2 each partridges
1 cup lentils
6 cup broth, chicken
1 lb veal bones
1 medium carrots; peeled
1 each parsnip; peeled
1 each celery knob; peeled
1/4 lb bacon, smoked
2 tablespoon flour, all-purpose
1 small onions; chopped
1/2 teaspoon mustard, prepared
1/3 cup heavy cream

Soak partridges in cold water 3-4 hours. Place lentils in soup pot
with chicken broth, veal bones, carrot, parsnip and celery. Slowly
bring to a boil.
Cut smoked bacon into small dice and render fat. With slotted spoon
remove cracklings and set aside.
Dry partridges. Very quickly brown the whole bird in the bacon
drippings, giving them some color. Remove partridges and place in
soup pot with lentils.
Make a roux with the same fat used to brown the partridges and the
flour and onion. Add 1/2 cup cold water and whip until smooth.
When partridges and lentils are done, about 2 hours, add liquified
roux. Cook for an additional 10 minutes. Take out partridges and bone
them. Replace meat chunks in soup. Just before serving, whip mustard
and cream into the soup.

Note: partridges can be one of the toughest birds in the world, and
the 2 hour cooking time may be longer. This is an excellent way to
prepare what would otherwise be a very tough bird.

Lentil Loaf

meats, vegetarian

1 cup lentils cooked
1 medium onion, peeled and sliced
1  tomato, diced
1 1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 tablespoon grated parmesan (fresh
1  please!)
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon corn or peanut oil
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt

Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman Lentil Loaf Oil for loaf pan

Saute onion and tomato in oil until onion is golden and tomato is
soft. In a bowl mash up the cooked lentils a little. Add onion &
tomato; mix in garlic powder, salt, milk, cheese, and 1 cup of the
bread crumbs. Preheat oven to 350. Glop mixture into oiled loaf pan,
sprinkle remaining crumbs on top and bake for 1/2 hour or until done.
You could add a Tbs. of ketchup...you could put just about anything
in there (celery, bell pepper...) Tonight I'm going to beat one egg
and mix it in to make the loaf stick together better. And maybe add a
touch of ketchup or BBQ sauce or something. You can serve with any
sauce or gravy or anything.

Loin Lamb Chops With Fresh Spinach & Mushroom

beverages, meats

      ----JUDI M. PHELPS----
8  boneless loin lamb chops; cut 1-inch thick (about 2
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh rosemary; minced
1 lb mushrooms; sliced 1/4-inch thick
1 lb fresh spinach; stemmed and rinsed
1/2 cup dry red wine
3 tablespoon unsalted butter

Preheat the broiler.  Rub the chops all over with 2 tablespoons of the
olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the rosemary.
Set the chops aside.

In a large heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over high
heat.  Add the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1/4
teaspoon rosemary. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they are golden
brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set
aside.

Broil the lamb chops about 5 inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes
on each side, or until golden brown on the outside and rosy pink in
the center.  Remove the string from each chop. Reheat the mushrooms
briefly over moderate heat and arrange neatly down the center of a
warmed serving platter.  Put the chops on top of the mushrooms.

In the large nonreactive skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon
olive oil over moderately high heat.  Add the spinach and the
remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until wilted
and tender but still bright green, about 4 minutes.  Spoon the
spinach around the chops. Cover to keep warm.

Add the wine to the pan and cook over high heat until it is reduced
to 1/4 cup, about 4 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the
butter. Pour over the chops and serve.

Lokdolmar (Stuffed Onion Rolls)

appetizers, main dish, meats, swedish

1/2  swedish meatball recipe
3 large onions; yellow (1/2 lb ea); peele
3 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon fresh bread crumbs

Place the peeled onions in a 2 or 3 quart pot, add enough cold water
to cover and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Lower the heat and
simmer the onions, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Remove them from the
pot, drain and let cool on a platter while you make the meat stuffing
(see recipe). Pull off each onion layer separately. They should slide
off quite easily. Cut the largest outer layers of the onions in half,
but remember to leave them large enough to enclose the stuffing.
Discard the inner part of the onions (or use them for some other
purpose) if the leaves are too small to stuff. Put a heaping teaspoon
of the meat stuffing in the middle of each onion leaf and enclose it
by folding over the edges of the leaf. At this poinnt they may be
covered with plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days before
cooking. Preheat oven to 400F. In a shallow flameproof baking dish,
melt 3 tablespoons of butter over low heat. Remove the dish from the
heat and place the onion rolls, sealed side down, side by side in the
butter, first rolling each in the butter to coat it. Bake 15 minutes,
then baste with butter in the dish, sprinkle with bread crumbs and
bake another 15 minutes until the onions are lightly browned and the
crumbs crisp. Lkdolmar may be served as part of a smrgsbord or as
a main dish.

London Broil With Hunter's Sauce

meats, beef, sauces

2 lb flank steak
2 tablespoon peanut oil
1  salt and pepper
3 tablespoon butter
1  hunter's sauce for serving
3 tablespoon parsley, chopped

1. Preheat a broiler rack with the broiler set on high. 2. Rub the
flank steak on both sides with oil and salt and pepper. Use generous
amount of black pepper. 3. Place the meat on the broiler rack, and
let cook about 4-5 in. from the source of the heat. Broil about 3-5
min. and turn the meat. Broil on the other side 3-5 min. Cooking time
will depend on the desired degree of doneness. 4. Transfer the steak
to warmed serving platter and dot with butter. Let the steak stand in
a warm place about 5 min. to redistribute the internal juices of the
meat. 5. Juices will accumulate around the steak as it stands. Add
these to the hunter's sauce. Sprinkle the meat with chopped parsley
and carve it on the diagonal. Serve with the sauce.

For hunter's sauce, the quickest way is to take some mushrooms and
slice them thin. Then saute in a tbsp of butter. Once done add to a
can of brown gravy or a brown sauce and a few black peppercorns.

Love In Disguise

meats

2 lb pigs' hearts
1 small onion
4 oz fresh breadcrumbs
1  bay leaves
1  parsley
2  lemons (zest only)
1  egg; beaten with milk
2 tablespoon milk; to beat with egg
2 teaspoon wine vinegar
1  french mustard
15 oz canned tomatoes
1  a little stock
2 oz butter
1 oz well-seasoned flour
1  few spoonfuls yoghurt (opt.)

You may get 2 or 3 large hearts for this weight or several smaller ones.
Whatever the size, they will be slashed; this is normal.  Wash the hearts
and trim away waste - fat, membrane, gristle and arteries. Soak in lightly
salted water for 10 minutes then rinse, drain and dry well. Chop the onion
finely and soften it in 1 oz butter.  Away from the heat stir in the
breadcrumbs, lemon zest, 4 tablespoons parsley and lots of salt and pepper.
Bind with the egg and milk.  Use the mixture to stuff the heart cavities,
and secure the openings with toothpicks or cocktail sticks - there is no
need to make perfect closures.

Whizz the tomatoes in a blender, stir in the vinegar and add enough stock
to make up to 1 pint.  Dust the hearts thoroughly with the well-seasoned
flour.  Melt 1 oz butter in a flameproof casserole, stir in the leftover
flour and let it brown a little.  Blend in the tomato mixture and make a
smooth, bubbling hot sauce.  Lay the prepared hearts in the sauce and tuck
the bay leaves among them. Cover with greaseproof paper and the lid, and
cook at 325 F (160 C) gas mark 3 for 1 hour. Turn the hearts gently and
continue cooking for 1 to 1-1/2 hours more until meat is beautifully
tender.

Transfer the hearts to a warmed serving dish.  Stir the mustard into the
sauce, add salt and pepper to taste - and carefully blend in the yoghurt if
liked.  Pour the sauce over the hearts, scatter lavishly with chopped
parsley and serve with boiled potatoes or noodles.

Mageretsa & Psito - Lamb & Lemon Soup Wit

lamb, greek

1  stephen ceideburg
1  lamb leg
1  lamb liver
1  or more lamb heads
1  several lambs' tongues
1 bunch green onions, finely chopped
1  potatoes
1 bunch fennel, finely chopped
1  olive oil
1  oregano
1  garlic
2  lemons, juice only
1/2 cup uncooked rice per person
3  eggs
1 large lemon, juice only

Into a large stockpot put sufficient cuts of lamb to feed the number
of diners.

Aliki uses a leg, a liver, one or more lamb heads cut in half and
several lambs' tongues (the meat is ordered in advance from a Greek
butcher in Marrickville). Cover with water and bring to the boil.

Skim the stock, then add a bunch of green (spring) onions and a bunch
of fennel herb, finely chopped.

Cover and simmer gently until the leg of lamb is cooked, 2-3 hours.

Drain off the lamb stock and reserve.

Finely dice the cooked liver and add it to the lamb stock. Peel the
skin from the lambs' tongues.

In a very large baking dish, put a generous amount of olive oil,
oregano, garlic (Aliki does not put in garlic but many do) and the
juice of 2 lemons.

Turn the lamb leg, tongues and head in this mixture to coat them and
put them in the centre of the baking dish. Surround the meat with
potatoes (Aliki puts in pumpkin, too) cut in chunks, turn them in the
oil and put the dish in a moderate oven until the meats have crisped
and the potatoes are cooked -- about one hour.

Turn the meat and vegetables midway through cooking.

Meanwhile, measure the-amount of liver-enriched stock neces- sary for
the number of diners (about one cup per person) and cook in it half a
cup of rice (preferably short grain) for every 6 people.

Separate 3 eggs and beat the whites until stiff, then add yolks and
beat again.

Finally, add the juice of a large lemon. Ladle some of the simmering
soup into the eggs then add the egg mixture back into the soup,
stirring vigorously.

Adjust the seasoning and serve the soup.

After the soup, serve the roasted meat and potatoes with a simple
salad (not too oily because the main dish is rich) of lettuce,
cucumber, radishes and tomatoes.

Maltese Sauce  (Malteser Sosse)

fish, meats, vegetables, german, sauces

1/2  blood orange or reg. ogange
1  green onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon dry white wine
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
3 tablespoon chicken stock
2  egg yolks, slightly beaten
1/2 cup butter, cut in small pieces
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1  salt
1  white pepper
5 tablespoon fresh whipped cream *

* 3 to 5 tablespoons of REAL whipped cream...NO substitutes.

This sauce needs to be made with extra care. Cut peel from half the
orange, removing only the colored portion. Cut peel into fine narrow
strips. Blanch peel briefly in boiling water, if desired. Finely chop
peel, if desired; set aside. Juice orange; set aside. In a small
skillet, simmer green onion 5 minutes over low heat in wine, vinegar
and stock. Strain well, discarding green onion; cool slightly. Place
egg yolks and wine mixture in a small enamel-lined saucepan. Place
over hot water or use a double-boiler. Water should be barely
simmering at any time. If mixture is over heated it will curdle and
must be remade from new ingredients. Add butter, one piece at a time,
mixing well and making sure each piece is fully incorporated before
adding the next. If desired use a whisk to beat butter into yolk
mixture. When all butter has been added, sauce should be fairly thick
and creamy. Add lemon juice, salt, white pepper, balnched orange peel
and juice. Fold in whipped cream before serving. Serve immediately to
prevent sauce from seperating. This sauce is delicious with delicate
fish or vegetable dishes, such as asparagus. It is also very good
with broiled meat. Makes 4 servings.

Maple Sugar Smoking Rub

meats, misc, native american

      ----SPIRIT OF THE HARVEST----
1/2 cup salt, coarse
1 cup sugar, maple
1 teaspoon peppercorns

Brown sugar can be substituted for maple sugar.

Coarsely grind peppercorns.  Mix all ingredients.

Pat meat or fish dry and rub inside and out with seasoning mixture. Place
in cool, dry place for about 1 hr.  Place wood chips in water to soak.
Smoke until done.

If you do not have a smoker or wish to build the traditional Indian one
described here, improvise by building a charcoal fire with all vents open.
While fire is burning down, loop a piece of kitchen string under gills of
each trout.  Bring ends of string through vent holes of grill cover and tie
so that fish are suspended from lid and tails remain at least 6" above
coals.  When coals have burned down and are covered with white ash,
sprinkle 1/3 of damp wood chips over fire and place on grill. Smoke trout
for about 1 hour, adding more damp wood chips every 15-20 minutes to keep
up smoke.  Remove fish and serve hot or at room temp. Refrigerated, smoked
fish will last about 1 week.

Marinated Beef Brisket  Texas Style

beef, brisket, tex mex, smoker

1  texas dry rub - see recipe
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 1/2 tablespoon madeira wine
3 tablespoon olive oil [use extra-virgin]
1  whole beef brisket  4 to 5 pounds

From: Michelle Bass Combine the rub, lime juice, Madeira and olive
oil in a blender. Process until it becomes a smooth paste. Or combine
the ingredients in a small nonreactive bowl and stir into a paste.
Scrape the paste from the blender or bowl. With your hands lightly
oiled, rub the paste into the brisket, coating both sides well. Cover
the brisket with clear food wrap and marinate for a minimum of 36
hours in the refrigerator. Remove the brisket from the refrigerator
and let it sit at room temperature (for about 1 hour) before you
begin to cook.

TO COOK OUTDOORS, use a covered kettle grill or water smoker. In a
kettle grill, indriectly cook the brisket over a water pan containing
a basting liquid of water, orange juice, wine or something similar
for about 2 hours per pound, refreshing the coals with damp smoking
chips every couple of hours.  The brisket should have a dark crust
when finished. If you are using a water smoker, follw the
manufacturer's instructions. Remove the brisket from the grill and
let it stand for 10 minutes before slicing.

TO COOK INDOORS, preheat the oven to 200F.  Put the brisket in a
roasting pan and place in the center of the oven. Roast for 2 hours
per pound, undisturbed. Remove the brisket from the roasting pan and
let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.  If you like, combine the
pan juices with some warm barbecue sauce for serving.

To serve, slice the brisket across the grain.  Place overlapping
slices on a large platter, drizzle with barbecue sauce and garnish
with grilled red onions rings.

Yield:  10 to 12 servings.

Author's note:  The trick behind a perfectly moist beef brisket is
slow, even heat or smoke.  If you have a water smoker and access to
mesquite chips or hard wood, Texas beef brisket takes on added depth.
But you can get nice results indoors with your own oven. The Texas
Dry Rub becomes the basis of a smoky, savory paste. Serve the brisket
with your favorite barbecue sauce, a side of coleslaw and a garnish
of sliced, grilled red onions.

Note from me:  I used this recipe on a 3.25 pound eye of round roast
and let it marinate in the refrigerator for 72 hours. It was
delicious! The rub was very hot, so I rubbed it off the roast before
slicing so there was no overkill on heat.  We served two sauces on
the side: homemade BBQ sauce and horseradish sauce. Great with baked
beans and homegrown tomato salad!

Marinated Lamb

meats

1 cup red wine
1/2 cup soy sauce (up to 3/4 c)
1 tablespoon rosemary leaves, crushed
1 tablespoon black pepper, fresh
4  garlic cloves, crushed
1  half leg of lamb, butterflied

Mix together all of the ingredients except the lamb.  Place the lamb in a
bowl or pan that will not be corroded by the marinade (a glass 9x13 pan
works well).

Pour most of the marinade over the lamb.  Swish the lamb around and get it
soaked on both sides.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least
several hours, turning occasionally.

Start a fire in the grill and get the coals very warm but not flaming.
Place lamb on grill about 3-4 inches from the coals. Cook on this side for
20 minutes, basting with the extra marinade occasionally. Turn the meat
over and cook another 20 minutes.

After 10 minutes on the second side, start checking for doneness. Contrary
to many people's ideas, lamb should not be well done but should still be a
little pink. When done, slice thin and serve.

NOTES:

*  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- This is the best recipe I have ever
had for lamb. It really brings out the flavor wonderfully. It came
originally from the "Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook."

A wonderful side dish for this is the Spanish recipe for Garlic fried
potatoes.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.

*  For the meat, you need a half leg of lamb which has been butterflied. A
good butcher can do this for you but don't be afraid of trying it yourself.
To butterfly the leg, take a sharp knife and start at the side and work
towards the bone.  Once you have found the bone, work along it so you have
one side completely slit and then cut out the bone. Depending on which end
of the leg you have, you may need to puzzle over some of the weirdnesses of
the bone shape. Don't discard the bone, it makes interesting soup.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 40 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Soak the clay pot in cold water for 10 minutes. Tie the beef with
string in four places so that it will retain its shape as it cooks.
Combine all the marinade ingredients in the clay pot. Marinate the
beef for at least 24 hours, turning the beef several times. Add
sufficient water or beef broth to the marinade to cover 3/4 of the
height of the beef. Place the pot in a cold oven. Adjust the heat to
450 degrees F. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Serve with horseradish.

Meatballs In Tomato Sauce

meats

      ----SAUCE INGREDIENTS----
13 oz tomatoes, canned (1 large can), coa; rsely chopped, with juice
4 oz tomato sauce (1 small can)
1  garlic clove, minced
1/2 cup parsley, chopped
1 teaspoon chili powder
      ----MEATBALL INGREDIENTS----
1 lb pork sausage
1/2 cup parsley, chopped
1/2 cup cracker crumbs
1/2 cup parmesan cheese (grated)
1  egg
1 lb pasta (tagliarini, spaghetti or wha; tever)

Combine the sauce ingredients and bring to a boil while preparing the
meatballs.  Mix all meatball ingredients.  It is easiest to do this with
your hands. Form into walnut-sized balls.

Drop the meatballs into BOILING sauce.  If the sauce is not boiling, the
meatballs will fall to pieces.  Simmer gently for about an hour. If you are
making the sauce to eat right away, you will probably want to skim the
grease that cooks out of the sausage periodically. If you are making this
ahead, the grease will congeal when it sits overnight in the refrigerator,
and you can remove it easily then.

Check for salt.  Depending on the brands of sausage and tomatoes you use,
you may not need any. If you need to add salt, be sparing.

Boil the pasta.  Pour the sauce and meatballs over it and serve with grated
parmesan, or combine and reheat in a casserole, sprinkled with parmesan.

NOTES:

*  Simple meatballs in herb and garlic tomato sauce -- I've been making
this recipe since I was about 10 years old, and I don't remember where we
got it. It's easy and very good, though. Yield: serves 4-6.

*  This is fine made a day ahead.  Chilling it gives you a chance to remove
the grease that cooks out of the sausage.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Medieval Italian Stew (Pie In A Pipkin)

fruits, beef, italian, stew

3 lb stew beef; cut in 1/2 cubes
2 medium onions; chopped
1  cooking oil
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 teaspoon each cloves and cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon each nutmeg, mace and pepper
1 tablespoon white vinegar; or to taste
1  salt; to taste

Brown the beef in a skillet in a small quantity of oil. Place browned
beef *and its juices* in a stewpot. Add more oil (if necessary) to
the skillet; saute onions until tender and translucent.  Add onions
to stewpot. Add raisins and spices to the meat mixture, along with a
small quantity of water (approximately 1/2 cup). There should be just
enough water to prevent scorching and to help form the gravy.

Bring stew to a boil and reduce immediately to a simmer. Simmer,
covered, until meat is tender (about 1-1/2 to 2 hours). Stir
occasionally. Add water as necessary. When beef is cooked, add
vinegar and salt. Cook a few minutes more.

Carroll-Mann wrote: "This is a recipe I adapted from a 16th century
translation of a medieval Italian cookbook. The recipe is called "Pie
in a Pipkin" which means (crustless) meat pie in a stewpot. It has a
nice thick gravy and a sweet/tart flavor."

Mike Stock Beef Wellington

meats

1  2 lb beef fillet
1  recipe; marinade for beef
1  recipe; french lining pastry
1/4 lb mushrooms; fresh, sliced
1  recipe; anglais glaze

Trim any gristle and surplus fat from the fillet, then place in a
medium-sized bowl. Pour the marinade over the fillet and cover the
bowl with plastic wrap. Marinate the fillet for about 4 hours, turning
occasionally. Remove the fillet from the marinade and drain well.
Roll out the pastry on a well-floured board to 1/8 inch thickness.
Cut into a rectangle wide enough to overlap the fillet by 1 1/2
inches and long enough to cover the ends well. Place the pastry
rectangle carefully over a shallow baking dish. arrange half the
mushrooms length-wise down the center of the pastry, then place
fillet over the mushrooms. Arrange the remaining mushrooms over the
fillet. Wrap, glaze, then decorate the fillet for baking according to
the step by step instructions. Bake in a preheated 400-degree oven
for about 40 minutes for a medium rare fillet or 50 minutes for a
medium doneness. Serve immediately. STEP BY STEP DIRECTIONS:
#1.Wrapping the fillet; Lift one long side of the pastry over the
fillet and brush the edge with cold water. Lift the opposite side
over the top of the pastry and press gently to seal. #2. Wet the
short ends and press together sealing well. Trim off the excess
pastry. #3. Brush the wrapped fillet with Anglais glaze. #4. Cut the
pastry trimmings into decorative rounds, crescents or into 3/8 inch
strips for braiding. Place over the seam on the top of the pastry.
Brush the trim with glaze. Any unused trim may be glazed and baked
separately until golden brown. This recipe requires three additional
recipes that I am posting with this outline. The recipes required
are; Mike Stock Marinade for Beef, Mike Stock french lining pastry,
and Mike Stock Angais Glaze.
