      1 ea Dill cream dressing recipe
      5 ea Green onions; finely choppe
      1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
 
  A local restaurant serves a simple, but elegant, potato salad as part
  of their Sunday Brunch menu.  This is my own attempt at duplicating
  it. Stir the chopped green onions into the Dill Cream Dressing.  Add
  salt and pepper to taste.  You may also want to add more lemon juice
  or Dijon mustard at this point, as this produces a fairly bland
  dressing.  Slice potatoes (leave skins on) about 1/4 inch thick. Place
  in a large bowl and fold in the dressing.  Serve chilled.  Best made
  the day before so the flavors have a chance to mingle. Source:  Sallie

 Categories: Salads, Vegetables, Pot. salad
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb New potatoes, scrubbed
  1 1/2 lb Green beans
    1/3 c  Herb vinegar
    1/3 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      1 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Clove garlic
      1 ts Coleman's dry mustard
      2 ts Caraway seeds, crushed
    3/4 ts Celery seeds
      1 c  Walnut pieces
      1    Medium sweet red pepper
      6    Scallions (half green tops)
      1    Bunch parsley
    1/2 ts Black pepper, or to taste
 
  To prepare dressing, in blender container combine herb
  vinegar, olive oil, vegetable oil, granulated sugar,
  paprika, salt, garlic, dry mustard, caraway seeds, and
  celery seeds. Blend until well emulsified.
  
  Cut green beans on the diagonal in 1-1/2-inch pieces
  and cook in a large pot of boiling water until just
  tender-crisp. Refresh in cold water, drain and pat
  dry.
  
  Cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling water
  until just tender when pierced with aknife, 12-15
  minutes. Drain and pat dry. Allow the potatoes to cool
  slightly. Slice potatoes into 1/4-inch thick slices,
  drizzling a small amount of dressing over potato
  slices and tossing to coat as you slice.
  
  Add green beans to potato slices and toss to combine,
  drizzling a small amount of dressing to coat.
  
  Dice red pepper, chop scallions and parsley, and add
  with remaining ingredients and toss to combine,
  drizzling just enough additional dressing to evenly
  coat salad. Grind black pepper over salad to taste and
  lightly toss again. Taste and adjust seasonings.
  
  Salad is best if eaten the same day it is made -
  slightly warm or at room temperature - do not
  refrigerate! Leftovers should be refrigerated, but may
  be warmed slightly in the microwave before serving.
  
  NOTE: I use Soleillou Radiant Wine Herb Vinegar which
  contains white wine vinegar, cloves, thyme, rosemary,
  fennel, bay laurel leaves, basil, and marjoram. This
  is available from Balducci's, New York City.
  
  A reasonable substitute could probably be made by
  steeping these herbs in white wine vinegar for a few
  weeks before using.

 Categories: Salads, Vegetables, Pot. salad
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb New potatoes, scrubbed
  1 1/2 lb Green beans
    1/3 c  Herb vinegar
    1/3 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      1 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Clove garlic
      1 ts Coleman's dry mustard
      2 ts Caraway seeds, crushed
    3/4 ts Celery seeds
      1 c  Walnut pieces
      1    Medium sweet red pepper
      6    Scallions (half green tops)
      1    Bunch parsley
    1/2 ts Black pepper, or to taste
 
  To prepare dressing, in blender container combine herb vinegar, olive
  oil, vegetable oil, granulated sugar, paprika, salt, garlic, dry
  mustard, caraway seeds, and celery seeds. Blend until well
  emulsified.
  Cut green beans on the diagonal in 1-1/2-inch pieces and cook in a
  large pot of boiling water until just tender-crisp. Refresh in cold
  water, drain and pat dry.
  Cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling water until just tender
  when pierced with aknife, 12-15 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Allow the
  potatoes to cool slightly. Slice potatoes into 1/4-inch thick slices,
  drizzling a small amount of dressing over potato slices and tossing
  to coat as you slice.
  Add green beans to potato slices and toss to combine, drizzling a
  small amount of dressing to coat.
  Dice red pepper, chop scallions and parsley, and add with remaining
  ingredients and toss to combine, drizzling just enough additional
  dressing to evenly coat salad. Grind black pepper over salad to taste
  and lightly toss again. Taste and adjust seasonings.
  Salad is best if eaten the same day it is made - slightly warm or at
  room temperature - do not refrigerate! Leftovers should be
  refrigerated, but may be warmed slightly in the microwave before
  serving.
  NOTE: I use Soleillou Radiant Wine Herb Vinegar which contains white
  wine vinegar, cloves, thyme, rosemary, fennel, bay laurel leaves,
  basil, and marjoram. This is available from Balducci's, New York
  City.
  A reasonable substitute could probably be made by steeping these
  herbs in white wine vinegar for a few weeks before using.

      Title: New Potatoes with Salami & Sorrel
 Categories: Salads, Pot. salad
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Small new potatoes
      1 sm Handful of sorrel
      2 oz Italian salami (or more)
           -- thinly sliced
      1 sm Onion
           Coriander seed
           Wholegrain mustard
           Olive oil
           White wine vinegar
 
  Chop the onion roughly and partially soften it in 2 generous tablespoons of
  the oil.  Do not let it brown.  Scrub the potatoes (but on no account peel
  them) and steam them.  Wash and dry the sorrel, discarding tough stalks.
  Roll up the leaves tighly in your fingers, just a few at a time, as though
  making a cigarette, and snip across into fine ribbons.
  
      Tip the softened onion and its juices into a big bowl.  Stir in 1/2
  teaspoon each vinegar and mustard, some salt and lots of pepper and
  coriander seed.  The coriander seed should be freshly toasted and ground
  coarsely using a pestle and mortar or a spare peppermil.  Add the potatoes
  to the bowl while still piping hot, so they drink up the flavours of the
  dressing.  Cut each potato in half or into quarters depending on size, and
  toss gently.  Scatter some of the sorrel over the base of a shallow serving
  dish.  Pile the potatoes into the centre, encircle them with the sliced
  salami and scatter the remaining ribbons of sorrel over the top. Serve
  while potatoes are still warm.

      Title: Potato Salad Dressing
 Categories: Digest, Salads, Pot. salad
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Fatfree Ranch Salad
           Dressing
      2 tb Reduced Fat Mayonnaise*
      1 ts Superfine sugar
      1 ts Celery seed
    1/2 ts Mild vinegar (I use rice
           Vinegar)
      1 ts Gourmet mustard of your
           Choice
      2 ds Garlic powder
 
  * I use reduced fat mayonnaise instead of fatfree because I think the
  fatfree is totally tasteless and why bother.  I make this very rarely, so I
  justify the use of the mayonnaise to myself.
  
  This is better if you make the potato salad ahead of time and let it sit
  over night in the fridge so the tastes can marry well.
  
  I hope you enjoy it!

      Title: Tofu Potato Salad with Dill
 Categories: Digest, July, Salads, Pot. salad
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      5 lg Potatoes
    1/2 ts Salt
     10 oz Soft (MoriNu) lite tofu
      2    To 3 cloves garlic, minced
           Water for steaming
      4 tb Fresh dill weed (or 1-1/2
        tb Dried dill)
      2    To 3 Tbs. brown rice
           Vinegar
           Or lemon juice
           Water if needed for
           Blending
      2 ts Low-sodium tamari
      4    Stalks celery, minced
      2 ts Prepared mustard
    1/2 c  Minced fresh parsley
 
  Slightly adapted from the Vegetarian Times
  
  Bake, boil, microwave, or pressure cook potatoes until tender. Run under
  cold water to remove skins.  Chill.
  
  Meanwhile, steam tofu for 10 minutes.  While tofu is cooking, place rice
  vinegar (lemon juice), oil (if desired), tamari, mustard, salt and garlic
  in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth.
  
  Drain tofu, crumble and add to blender or food processor along with dill.
  Blend until smooth and creamy.  You may need to add a few tablespoons of
  water (up to 1/4 cup) depending on how soft the tofu is and how well your
  blender purees.  You will want it a little "loose" and liquidy, as the
  potatoes will absorb some of the moisture.
  
  Chop chilled potatoes into 1-inch cubes and place in a large mixing bowl.
  Pour tofu mixture on top of potatoes and mix, evenly coating potatoes. Stir
  in celery and parsley.  Be careful not to mash potatoes as you mix. Makes 6
  side-dish servings.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
-----------------------------------SALAD-----------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Small red new potatoes
           -unpeeled
      1    Green pepper; seeded and
           -sliced crosswise into rings
      4    Hard-boiled eggs
    1/2 sm Red onion; thinly sliced and
           -separated into rings
    1/2 c  Pitted ripe black olives
           -sliced in half crosswise
    1/4 c  Parsley; minced

----------------------------------DRESSING----------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
      3 tb Fresh; dill snipped
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 ts Dijon mustard
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt; optional
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Steam the unpeeled potatoes until they are just tender when pierced
  with a fork, but not mushy.  If they are very small, leave them
  whole, or, when cool enough to handle, cut them in half or quarters
  with a very sharp knife, taking care not to pull off the skin. Place
  them in a large bowl, or on a serving platter surrounded by the green
  pepper rings.
  
  Slice the eggs crosswise, but remove and discard two of the yolks.
  Arrange the slices over the potatoes.  Add the onion rings and
  olives, and sprinkle the salad with the parsley.  In a small bowl,
  combine the dressing ingredients.  Pour the dressing over the salad.
  Either serve the salad as is, or toss it gently.  The salad may be
  served at room temperature or chilled.  Source:  Jane Brody's Good

 Categories: Salads, Swiss, Potatoes, Vegetables, Pot. salad
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 c  Beef stock
      1 c  Chicken stock
  3 3/4 lb Mealy potatoes
    1/2 oz Fresh parsley
           Small onion
    1/2 c  Salad dressing
 
  (The Zeughauskeller is a big, cheerful restaurant in Zuerich which
  specializes in sausages, as well as serving steak, chicken, fish, and very
  good beer and Swiss wine, in an atmosphere of relaxed history [the
  restaurant building used to be the town armory, and working weapons still
  hang on the walls].  The following recipe is for their potato salad.
  They go through twenty metric tons of it per year.)
  
  (This recipe is an early approximation of the original recipe.  All
  amounts have been converted from the original metric, and reduced.)
  .
  Salad dressing:  About 1/2 C of a good mayonnaise, the fresher the
  better -- I think the Zeughauskeller makes their own fresh, every day --
  mixed to taste with German-style mustard (i.e. a sharp yellow mustard
  rather than a brown one).
  
  Every utensil must be scrupulously clean, then scalded, including pans.
  ~- Peel and cut up potatoes.  Cook until "almost ready", then drain
  (trying to retain starch).  Put in pan.  -- Pour BOILING stock over
  potatoes to bring out the starch and bind the potatoes together.  Let sit
  45 minutes to absorb.  -- Chop parsley and onions (to taste) by hand.  Add
  to potatoes, toss;  let sit in hot mixture to add flavor.  -- Pour salad
  dressing over salad:  toss.

    1/4 c  Hellman's low fat mayo

      1 lb Fresh green beans
      1 ea Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Mince garlic very finely and blend into mayo along with vinegar.  Set aside
  to let flavors to blend.  Scrub potatoes well and cut into 1-1 1/2" pieces.
  Place in steamer basket and steam until just tender (10-15 min).  While the
  potatoes steam, trim ends off green beans and snap them in half.  Rinse
  potatoes under cold water and place in strainer to cool while you steam the
  green beans just until crisp-tender (3-5 min).  Rinse beans under cold
  water until cool and place in strainer to drain. Toss potatoes and beans
  with mayo mixture to coat and season with salt and pepper. You can chill
  this or just eat it at room temperature. I imagine some red, yellow or

      Title: Grilled Salmon with Potato and Watercress Salad
 Categories: Grill, Low-fat, Fish, Salads, Pot. salad
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 lb Small red thin-skinned
           Potatoes
      1 c  Thinly sliced red onion
      1 c  Seasoned rice vinegar
           About 1/2 pound watercress
           Rinsed and crisped
      1    Salmon fillet, about 2 lbs.
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Firmly packed brown sugar
      2 c  Alder or mesquite wood chips
           Soaked in water
           Salt
 
  In a 5-to 6-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat;
  add potatoes.  Cover and simmer over low heat until potatoes are tender
  when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain and chill.
  
  Soak the onions about 15 minutes in cold water to cover.  Drain and mix
  onions with rice vinegar.  Cut potatoes in quarters; add to onions.
  
  Trim tender watercress sprigs from stems, then finely chop enough of the
  course stems to make 1/2 cup (discard extras or save for other uses).  Mix
  chopped stems on a large oval platter with potato salad  alongside; cover
  and keep cool.
  
  Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Place, skin side down, on a piece of heavy
  foil.  Cut foil to follow outlines of fish, leaving a 1-inch border.
  Crimp edges of foil to fit up against edge of fish.  Mix soy sauce with
  brown sugar and brush onto the salmon fillet.
  
  Lay fish on center of grill, not over coals or flame.  Cover barbecue
  (open vents for charcoal) and cook until fish is barely opaque in thickest
  part (cut to test),  15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer fish to platter with
  salad.  Add salt to taste.  Serve hot or cold.

      Title: Avocado and Potato Salad with Horseradish
 Categories: Herb/spice, Salads, Side dish, Vegetables, Pot. salad
      Yield: 1 salad
 
      2 lb New potatoes; scrubbed
    1/4 c  Olive oil
  1 1/2 tb Red wine vinegar
           Salt
    1/2 c  Sour cream
    1/2 c  Plain yogurt
      2 tb Prepared horseradish
    1/4 c  Fresh dill sprigs
           -- loosely packed
           -- thick stems removed
      3    Celery ribs; strings removed
           -- cut in 1/4" crescents
           -- (1 cup)
      2 md Avocados* or 1 lg. avocado
      1 tb Lime juice; freshly squeezed
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  *Choose avocados that are firm, with just a slight give.  If the
  avocado is soft enough to hold an indentation, it's overripe and
  won't have the rich nutty flavor that you want for this salad.
  
  Bring water to a boil in the bottom of a vegetable steamer.  Cut
  potatoes in half; place them in the steamer basket.  Cover and steam
  until they are cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Remove the potatoes
  from the heat and allow them to cool slightly.
  
  While potatoes are cooking, whisk oil and vinegar together in a large
  bowl.  Season to taste with salt; set aside.  When potatoes are cool
  enough to handle without burning your fingers, cut them in 1" cubes.
  Toss them in the oil and vinegar so they are coated well, and set
  them aside to cool to room temperature, tossing occasionally.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, yogurt and
  horseradish. Mince the dill and add it to the sour cream mixture,
  stirring well.
  
  When potatoes have cooled to room temperature, add celery and toss to
  combine.  Then add the sour cream mixture; toss again.
  
  Halve, pit and peel the avocados.  Cut them into 1" cubes; place in a
  small bowl with the lime juice.  Toss so the cubes are moistened with
  the juice. Then add the avocados, with all of the lime juice, to the
  potatoes; toss gently until they are well distributed and coated with
  the dressing. Add pepper and additional salt to taste, and either
  serve immediately or chill for 30 minutes and then serve.
  
  While Loomis says that this salad does not keep well and shouldn't be
  counted on for leftovers, she says that it's one of the most popular
  potato salads she's ever made.
  
  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

      Title: Chilled Garbanzo and Potato Salad with Onion And Garlic
 Categories: Salads, Vegetables, Pot. salad
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Red Potatoes -- * see note
      3    Italian Plum Tomatoes --
           (red-ripe)
    1/2 md Red Onion -- minced
     16 oz Can Garbanzo Beans
    1/4 lb Fresh Spinach -- ** see
           Note
           -----The Dressing-----
      1 tb Extra Virgin Olive Oil
      2 tb Red Wine Vinegar
      4    Cloves Garlic -- minced
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Fresh Ground Black Pepper
      1 tb Fresh Parsley -- minced
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 ts Crushed Dried Hot Red
           Chilies -- (or to taste)
 
  * small red potatoes, scrubbed and cut into bite-sized pieces
  ** washed and finely chopped (optional)
  
  First, mix all the stuff together for the dressing in a small bowl or
  a measuring cup. Let that sit for at least a few minutes usually,
  if you make it first, then do the potatoes and tomatoes, that's plenty
  of time.
  
  Next, bring about 4-6 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan (more is
  better, but leave room for the potatoes), and add the scrubbed
  bite-sized potato pieces. Bring back to a boil, and boil for 4-5
  minutes. Do not overcook! You don't want them to be hard, but you
  don't want them to be mush, either. Drain the potatoes, and rinse well
  under cold water (or cover with cold water, then drain and rinse).
  
  Drain the garbanzo beans and rinse them thoroughly under cold water.
  
  Cut the tomatoes into bite-sized pieces, but smaller than the potato
  pieces. Chop up the spinach (if you're using it). Mix everything
  together, including the dressing, in a bowl that is big enough to stir
  it without dumping bits over the side.
  
  Cover the bowl, and chill for at least 4 hours, tossing it once or
  twice to make sure the dressing continues to coat things.

  Shea MacKenzie's The Garden of Earthly Delights Cookbook
  
  My modifications to this recipe were to increase the garlic, cut back
  a lot on the oil, increase the potatoes, omit the sweet bell pepper,
  and add an extra plum tomato. This is my favorite potato salad.

  bowl with the lime juice.  Toss so the cubes are moistened with the juice.
  Then add the avocados, with all of the lime juice, to the potatoes; toss
  gently until they are well distributed and coated with the dressing. Add
  pepper and additional salt to taste, and either serve immediately or chill
  for 30 minutes and then serve.
  
  While Loomis says that this salad does not keep well and shouldn't be
  counted on for leftovers, she says that it's one of the most popular potato
  salads she's ever made.
  
  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
