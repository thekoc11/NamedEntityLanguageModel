 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Skinned, blanched whole
           -almonds
           Ice water
      4    Egg whites
  2 2/3 c  Confectioners sugar
    1/2 c  Orange juice
 
  Colors: Natural, or, if necessary, artificial parsley or mallow for
  green sandalwood or alkanet for red saffron or dandelion for yellow
  blue turnsole for light blue violets for lavender
  
  1. In a mortar and pestal or a blender, grind the almonds to a thick
  paste. Add small amounts of ice water, about 1/2 tsp. at a time, to
  prevent the almonds from becoming to oily.  Place almond paste in a
  large mixing bowl. 2.  In another bowl, beat egg whites until they
  peak. Gradually beat in the sugar. 3. Add the sweetened egg whites to
  the almond paste. With fingers wet in orange juice, knead the
  resulting mixture. If the mixture is too sticky to handle, add small
  amounts of orange juice, 1 tsp. at a time. Thoroughly knead for about
  10 minutes. 4. Separate the marzipan into several sections, on for
  every color required for your sculpture. 5. In a separate small
  mixing bowl for each color, place the marzipan portions and cover the
  bowl tightly with a clean cloth tied securely or with aluminum foil.
  Allow these to ripen or "age" in refrigerator for at least 24 hours.
  (One old recipe recommends aging for a fortnight). Two days ought to
  suffice. 6. Mix the natural coloring agents, into the aged marzipan.
  The stiff confection will be easier to knead if allowed to return to
  room temp. 7.  Sculpture the paste according to your wildest fancy.
  Wet fingers, preferably in ice water.

      2 lb Breast of veal
      1    Onion; quartered
      1 ts Salt
           Pepper; to taste

      2    Egg yolks
      1 c  Cream
 
  Cut the veal into cubes, pour boiling salted water over it, and let
  soak for 20 minutes.  Drain the veal and put in a pan; cover with
  water. Add the onion, salt, pepper, carrot (cut into quarters), bay
  leaf and parsley. Bring to a boil and simmer slowly for about one
  hour, or until the veal is tender.  When the meat is done, make a
  white sauce with the butter, flour and meat stock from the veal. Cook
  for twenty minutes and add the egg yolks mixed with the cream. Pour
  over the meat and serve in a casserole.
  
  VARIATION:  This may be served with small white onions. Put the

    1/2 ts Salt
           Butter; melted
 
  In a small mixer bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar at high

  forefinger) and whites are glossy and stand in soft peaks. Beat in
  rum extract; gently fold in pecans.
  
  Spread about 1/3 cup meringue across half of each crepe. Staring at
  midpoint of edge of filled side, roll up crepe, pressing lightly so
  filling puffs out at ends of rolled crepe. Arrange filled crepes in
  greased 13x9x2-inch baking dish; bake in preheated 475 F. oven until
  meringue is firm but not brown, about 7 to 9 minutes. Meanwhile, in
  small saucepan over medium heat, bring brown sugar, water and ginger
  to a boil. Boil and stir syrup until thickened, about 4 minutes.
  Gently stir in peaches; cook until heated through, about 1 to 2
  minutes. Serve crepes hot with peach syrup.
  
  *** CREPES ***
  
  In mixer bowl, combine egg yolks, milk, water and 3 tablespoons melted
  butter; beat until well blended. Add flour and salt; beat until
  smooth.
  
  Heat 10-inch omelet or crepe pan over medium-high heat, until just hot
  enough to sizzle a drop of water. Brush pan lightly with melted
  butter.
  
  For each crepe, pour in 1/4 cup batter, tipping and tilting pan to
  move batter quickly over bottom. Cook until lightly browned on bottom
  and dry on top. Remove crepe from pan or, if desired, turn and brown
  other side. Brush pan lightly with melted butter as needed to prevent
  sticking. Stack crepes between layers of wax paper until ready to
  fill.

  On the weekend before Thanksgiving, set aside some homemade bread, to
  dry out. Leave it unwrapped so that it will dry thoroughly.
  
  Thanksgiving morning, cut the bread into thick slices and remove the
  crust from each slice.  Dip each slice into cold water, and wring out
  carefully. After squeezing each slice dry, crumble it into a large
  bowl by rubbing between your hands.
  
  Add salt, pepper, sage, thyme and chopped onion to the bowl, and stir

  *  A stuffing recipe from the founder of Pepperidge Farm Margaret
  Rudkin founded the Pepperidge Farm bakery as a health-food venture in
  1937 because one of her children was allergic to white bread. Her
  family lived on a farm in Connecticut that had a lot of pretty
  sorghum trees that the locals called "pepperidge trees," hence the
  name. Rudkin's pediatrician asked to buy loaves of her whole-grain
  bread for other children with white-flour allergies, and so the
  business was started. If you look in cookbooks published in that era,
  they mostly say that it is impossible to make bread from whole grains
  because the flour was too coarse and the bread would not hold
  together.  In its time, this was a very risky venture.
  
  In 1963, Margaret Rudkin published a cookbook with all of her family
  recipes. It's called "The Margaret Rudkin Pepperidge Farm Cookbook,"
  (Atheneum Press). It is a rare book, and has been out of print for 20
  years.  In 1965 Grosset and Dunlap republished it with much wider
  distribution, but that book is also out of print.
  
  In general I have found that the recipes in this book are nearly
  identical to the products sold by the Pepperidge Farm bakery, and
  it's a lot of fun to make your own. Here is her recipe for
  Thanksgiving turkey stuffing.
  
  *  Rudkin's notes say "taste and sniff as you go, because you might
  like more sage or thyme."
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  4 days drying bread, 10 minutes preparation.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: MARGARET'S BUTTERMILK RAISIN BREAD
 Categories: Abm, Breads, Dairy
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      3 tb Dry buttermilk powder
    7/8 c  Water
      1    Egg
      3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Sugar
    1/3 c  Butter or margarine
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    2/3 c  Raisins
  1 1/2 ts Yeast
 
  Place all ingredients in bread pan, select Light Crust setting, and
  press Start.
  
  After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake
  rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.
  
  This bread earns rave reviews from all tasters!  It's very moist and
  tender, and is delicious toasted.  Our friend Margaret loved it at
  first taste.  In fact, shortly after that she purchased a bread
  machine. It *really* is that good.  (Note:  For the rapid-baking
  1-pound Welbilt machine, reduce the butter to 1 1/2 tablespoons and
  the raisins to 1/3 cup.)
  
  This is a delicious buttermilk loaf!  I like to put the raisins in at
  the "beep" so they don't get smushed up.
  :)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      3 pk 8-oz. "bricks" Neufchatel
           -cheese; (reduced-fat cream
           -cheese), room temp
  1 1/4 c  Light sour cream

           -liqueur
  2 1/2 tb Tequila
  2 1/2 tb Fresh lime juice
      4 lg Eggs

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
    3/4 c  Light sour cream
      1 tb Fresh lime juice
      1 tb Sugar
           Very thin limes slices; cut
           -in half
           Very thin lime peel strips
 
  Made with reduced-fat cream cheese and light sour cream, this
  cheesecake is irresistible - just like its namesake cocktail.
  
  FOR CRUST: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350F. Spray
  9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with vegetable oil
  spray. Mix graham cracker crumbs and butter in medium bowl until
  blended. Press crumbs over bottom and 1 inch up sides of prepared
  pan. Refrigerate crust. FOR FILLING: Using electric mixer, beat
  cheese in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in sour cream, then sugar,
  triple sec, tequila and lime juice. Beat in eggs. Pour filling into
  crust. Bake until outside 2 inches are set and center moves only
  slightly when pan is shaken, about 50 minutes. Remove from oven; turn
  off oven. FOR TOPPING: Whisk sour cream, lime juice and sugar in
  small bowl to blend. Spread evenly over cheesecake. Return cheesecake

 Categories: Other sauce, Salsas

    1/2 c  Cubed tomato, 1/2 " cubes
    1/2 c  Chopped red or white onion
      4 ea Or more copped jalapenos
      1 ea Clove garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Gold or white tequila
 
  A splash of tequila makes all the difference in this robust salsa; it
  has a way of mellowing the searing nature of terrifically hot foods.
  I like this sauce on seafood, chicken, and any king of chops - pork,
  veal or lamb.
  
  Combine all ingredients and let stand for at least 30 minutes at room
  temperature.  Taste and adjust seasonings. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.

      Title: MARGO'S LAMB STEW
 Categories: Meats, Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 lg Onion (thinly sliced)
      4    Garlic cloves, minced
      3 lb Lamb cut into
           -stew-sized cubes and
           -carefully trimmed of fat
      4 lb Tomatoes, cooked
           -(2 large cans)
      3    Bay leaves
           Lemon juice
      1 tb Hungarian paprika
      1 ts Celery salt
    1/2 ts Cumin, ground
    1/8 ts Cayenne
      1 ds Allspice
      1 ds Cinnamon, ground
  1 1/2 lb Green beans, fresh,
           -washed and trimmed
 
  In a steeped, saute onion in olive oil on medium-low heat until golden
  brown. Add garlic in the last 2-3 minutes. Add lamb cubes and saute
  until brown. Add tomatoes and simmer until meat is tender. Keep an
  eye on the liquid; add water or red wine if it becomes dry.
  
  Add bay leaves, lemon juice and spices.  Simmer on low heat for at
  least 2 hours.  About 1/2 hour before pronouncing it done, add the
  green beans. Serve with plain yogurt and pita bread.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fragrant lamb stew -- This recipe comes from Margo Kaiser, with
  whom I used to work. It's a delicious stew, spiced fragrantly but not
  hot. It's one of my favorites. It's also very easy. The most tedious
  work is trimming the lamb, and you can get the butcher to take care
  of that.
  
  The spice mixture is my attempt to re-create Margo's "secret spice"
  (she didn't offer that recipe).  Feel free to try your own
  variations. If you hit on one that you feel is particularly good,
  please let me know about it. Yield:  serves 6 to 8.
  
  *  I prefer to cook to the point of simmering, refrigerate overnight,
  and then finish cooking the next evening. This greatly enhances the
  flavor. When you take the stew from the refrigerator, skim any lamb
  fat that has congealed on the top before continuing.
  
  *  I find that many butchers don't understand that I want good
  quality meat in stews. I get better quality, more carefully trimmed
  meat by telling them that I want lamb cubes cut for shish kebab.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

 Categories: Side dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Butternut squash (about 2
           -pounds), peeled, seeded and
           -cut into 1" chunks (see
           -note below)
      6 md Carrots, cut int 6" chunks
      1 tb Unsalted butter or low-fat

    1/8 ts Ground ginger
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper,
           -to taste
 
  Winter squash - acorn or butternut - is an exciting substitute for the
  unusual baked or mashed potatoes. The bite of ginger spices squash up
  perfectly. For a sweeter taste, add cinnamon, nutmeg and mace along
  with the ginger. My Jamaican friend, Maria, shared her easy,
  delicious recipe with us.
  
  1. Place squash and carrots in a large, heavy pot and cover with
  salted water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cook until
  tender, 15-20 minutes. Drain well and remove to a bowl.
  
  2. Coarsely mash vegetables along with the butter and ginger. Season
  generously with salt and pepper.

  NOTE: Butternut squash can be diffucult to cut, because the pulp is
  very firm and the outer skin is slightly tough, so work carefully.
  Cut the squash in half crosswise at the base of the large neck. Then
  carefully cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out any seeds in the cavity
  and slice the halves into 1" lengths crosswise. Peel the skin from
  each piece and continue with recipe.

  Well, I finally found that recipe I told you about, and another one
  that's slightly different. Neither is anything like the ones I saw
  posted on the echo the past few days. The first one is tried and true
  from my mom's Polish neighbor. The second is from the folks who make
  the Solo filling.

  Cream butter and cream cheese together. Add egg, vanilla; then mix in
  the flour. Cover and chill for a few hours to overnight. Roll out on
  lightly floured board to 1/4" thickness and cut with round cookie
  cutters. Place them on a cookie sheet as you would cookies. Use thumb
  to make indentation in center of each. Fill with about 1 tsp of
  desired filling. Bake at 350 F until lightly golden, about 10-15
  minutes (guessing here, I just do it by sight).

  flour, cream of wheat, eggs butter, salt and nutmeg. Knead well and
  roll out on a well floured board, about 1 cm thick and cut into 3 x 3
  inch squares. Wash the apricots and remove the stones. Put a cube of
  sugar in place of the stone, put the apricot back together and place
  in the middle of the square. Fold the dough over and with
  well-floured hands knead it into a dumpling. 2. Finish all squares
  the same way. Bring a pot of water to a boil (with a pinch of salt)
  and slide in the dumplings and let them simmer (don't let them get
  stuck on the bottom) for about 6-8 minutes. Shake the pot gently so
  they don't get stuck. They are done when they drop to the bottom.
  Serve them hot ripped open at once with cinnamon sugar on top.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 kg Potatoes
    1/2 ts Salt
    300 g  Flour
      1 kg Fresh apricots
        sm Cubes of sugar
    100 g  Plain bread crumbs

  With your hands, form a pattie of dough not much more than a cm. thick
  which can encircle the apricot. Place the apricot inside the dough and
  seal.
  
  Have a large pot of boiling, slightly salted water ready. When all the
  dumplings are formed, place them into the boiling water and cook for
  10 minutes, stirring as needed.
  
  Meanwhile, melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat and then stir
  in breadcrumbs.  Allow to brown slightly for two minutes, then add

  until dumplings are ready.
  
  When dumplings are cooked, remove from water and roll in pan of
  breadcrumbs. Serve warm. (Be careful, the fruit can be very hot!)
  
  [**note: you can also substitute the Pfanni potatoe dumpling mixture
  for the potatoe dough, if you can find this in your grocery
  store...that's how I remember my Mom usually making these]--

      1    Onion; chopped
      3    Cloves garlic; minced
      1    Dried red chile; seeded and

    1/2 ts Cumin seeds; crushed
      2    Cardamom pods; seeds removed
           -and finely crushed
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Saffron
  4 1/2 c  Chicken stock; warmed
      2 c  Long-grain rice
      1    Cinnamon stick
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 c  Dried currants
     12 sm Whole dried apricots; cut
           -in quarters
    3/4 ts ;salt (optional)
    1/2 c  Unblanched almonds
      3 tb Pine nuts
    1/2 c  Unsalted pistachio nuts;
           -shelled
           Black pepper to taste
      3 tb Fresh coriander leaves; torn
 
  In a large saucepan, melt the butter and olive oil over low heat. Add
  onion and garlic and cook until softened about 4 minutes stirring
  frequently. Increase the heat a little and add the chile, cumin
  seeds, cardamom, and ginger.  Cook, stirring, about 2 minutes until
  it is fragrant. Add the saffron and chicken stock, mix well and
  remove from the heat. Cover and let the saffron flavor the stock for
  5 minutes or so.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Bring the stock to a simmer over
  moderate heat.  Stir in the rice, cinnamon, bay leaf, currants,
  apricots and the salt. Return to a simmer, then reduce the heat to
  low. Cover and cook for another 15 to 16 minutes.  If the rice is too
  wet cook a little longer.
  
  Meanwhile, place the almonds and pine nuts on a baking sheet and
  toast them in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes until lightly golden. Add
  the pistachios and toast for another minute. Remove from oven and put
  on a plate to cool.
  
  Uncover the rice and using a fork stir to fluff. Season with
  additional salt and black pepper to taste. Add the nuts and toss it
  together. Sprinkle the coriander on top and serve.
  
  Judi's Notes:  I made this dish using 1 cup of orange juice for one
  cup of the chicken broth.  My friend Marilyn would scold me if she
  only knew, but it did give it a very good flavor. I also included 1/4
  tsp. of turmeric with the other spices which enhanced the dish nicely
  and gave it a lovely color too.  This is great with lamb kebabs,
  warmed pita bread, a nice middle eastern cucumber salad, and a
  Persian pastry for dessert.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Inch thick sirloin tip
           Roast
    1/2 c  Oil
    1/2 c  Red table wine
           Juice of one lemon
    1/4 ts Oregano
    1/4 ts Thyme

           Lots of black pepper
      1    Clove garlic -- pressed
      1    Bay leaves
      2 tb Meat tenderizer
 
  Place in jar and shake well..  Take large fork and poke holes in
  roast. Place roast and marinade in large Ziploc bag, or in flat pan
  and squeeze or turn to thoroughly coat meat. Let marinate 2 days in
  refrigerator.
  
  I made a  medium fire in the bottom of the smoker and left out the
  water pan and placed the roast on the grill for about 20 minutes per
  side. It is supposed to be medium, not well done. You'll have to
  check for doneness then and if not done to your taste, cook longer.
  It is FANTASTIC!! Dark brown on the outside and very tender on the
  inside.
  
  I also used the same marinade, doubled, and marinated a whole sirloin
  tip in a huge stainless steel bowl and smoked it with the water pan
  and it was great too, but only for a crowd!

 Categories: Marinades, Meats, Poultry, Fish/shellf
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Onion; finely chopped
      3    Sprigs parsley
      3    Scallions; chopped
    1/4 ts Powdered bay leaf
      1 ts Salt

           Juice of 1 lemon
    3/4 c  Oil
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
 
  Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly. Pour the mixture over the
  meat, chicken or fish to be marinated and allow to steep for 2 hrs.,
  turning occasionally. Then grill meat, and,if desired,slice thin and
  serve on garlic bread. Below is another recipe. Just a quickie, but
  quite good. I don't have amounts for everything. Just use your
  judgement accdng to how much meat you have. Soy sauce; a little red
  wine (optional); a bunch of garlic powder, and onion powder. Marinate
  at least one hour, turning once. >>> Grill and do same as with other
  marinade to serve. These two recipes are the only way we will eat
  steak. We are in cold climate in fall and winter, so we don't get to
  grill all year, but if we could, we would!! E N J O Y P.S. The red
  wine in the second recipe also helps tenderize the meat, in addition
  to adding flavor. FROM: DONNA HARTMAN (HDDW83B)

      1 ts Sugar
 
  "... Ingredients in a marinade can be varied, but it is important to
  use wine, vinegar, lemon juice, or some acidic liquid to break down
  the connective tissues. This process will make the steak more tender.
  Remaining marinade ingredients add flavor." Use a good-quality olive
  oil or walnut oil; add good-quality wine or vinegar and a combination
  of fresh and dried herbs, seasonings, garlic and soy sauce to make a
  flavorful marinade. 1. Place all ingredients in glass screw-top jar;
  shake vigorously. Arrange meat in shallow glass dish; pierce with a
  fork. Pour marinade over meat; turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate
  several hours or overnight, turning meat occasionally. 2. Remove meat
  from marinade; pat dry. Remove any pieces of spices or herbs that may
  stick to meat. This recipe is a steak marinade, but the ingredients
  can be adapted for other meats using the same techniques.

           NE  *****
 
  A marinade is a hgihly seasoned liquid used to impart flavor and in
  some Cased, tenderize tougher meats.  A rub is a hgihly concentrated
  blend of Herbs and spicesthat flavors the exterior of the meat as it
  grills. Marinades consist of liquid ingredients such as fruit or
  vegetable juces, Wine or water and oil in combination with seasoning
  for several hours or As long as overnight to impart flavor and/or
  tenderize. To tenderize a Marinade must contain an acidic inggredient
  such as lemon juice, wine, Vinegar, or yogart, the acid penetrates
  meat fibers to help tenderize Them. Rubs are applied to the exterior
  surface of tthe meat just before Grilling; they need no standing
  time. However for convenience rubs may be Applied several hrs in
  advance.  The coated meat should be refrigerated Until grilling time.
  Flavors become more pronounced the longer the rub is on the meat.
  Create your own blend or seasonings for rubs or use a commercial
  blend. Tips for marinade always marinate in the refrigerator; never
  at room temp Allow 1/4-1/2 cup of marinade ffor each 1-2 lbs meat
  marinades may be Cooked or uncooked.  Cooked marinades should be
  completely cooled before Use. A heavy duty plastic food bag is
  convenient for marinating. Select dishes In which the meat will fit
  snugly but lie flat turn meat occasionally During marinating so all
  sides are exposed to the marinade for Tenderization to take place
  most meat cuts must be marinated for at least 6 hrs, or as long as
  overnight. For flavor marinate 15 min or as long as 2 hrs. Marinades
  may also be brushed on during grilling. Discard used marinades never
  reuse them.

 Categories: Italian, Sauces
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
      2 sm Garlic cloves, minced OR
           Crushed and peeled*
  2 1/2 lb Plum tomatoes, peeled,
           Seeded and finely chopped
           OR one 35-oz. can and one
           14-oz. can of Italian plum
           Tomatoes, lightly drained
           And finely chopped
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
      2 tb Shredded fresh basil
 
  1.  In a medium nonreactive skillet, heat the oil over moderately low
  heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until golden, about 4
  minutes. Discard the garlic if desired. 2. Add the tomatoes, salt and
  pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30
  minutes. Soft bits of tomato will remain, and the sauce should be
  thick enough to hold its shape on a spoon. (The sauce can be made
  ahead and kept covered in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or frozen
  for up to 3 months.) Stir in the basil just before serving. *
  Crushed, peeled garlic cloves can be discarded after browning for a
  very subtle flavor or left in and discarded at the end of cooking for
  a slightly more emphatic garlic taste. More often than not I used
  minced garlic and leave it in.  This gives the sauce a strong garlic
  flavor. NOTE: Many southern Italians refer to a quick tomato sauce as
  "marinara" because it could be made at a moment's notice by a
  fisherman's wife upon her husband's return.  Serve over breaded or
  fried foods or mixed into baked pasta dishes or spaghetti, it is the
  most common southern Italian tomato sauce.  I like to make a simple
  marinara, which I can later adjust by adding sauteed onions, other
  fresh herbs, such as oregano, parsley, marjoram or rosemary, or by
  adding hot peppers.

      Title: MARINATED BEEF BRISKET  TEXAS STYLE
 Categories: Beef, Smoker, Brisket, Texas, Michelle
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
           Texas Dry Rub - see recipe
      1 tb Fresh lime juice
  1 1/2 tb Madeira wine
      3 tb Olive oil [use extra-virgin]
      1    Whole beef brisket
           - 4 to 5 pounds
 
  From: Michelle Bass Combine the rub, lime juice, Madeira and olive
  oil in a blender. Process until it becomes a smooth paste. Or combine
  the ingredients in a small nonreactive bowl and stir into a paste.
  Scrape the paste from the blender or bowl. With your hands lightly
  oiled, rub the paste into the brisket, coating both sides well. Cover
  the brisket with clear food wrap and marinate for a minimum of 36
  hours in the refrigerator. Remove the brisket from the refrigerator
  and let it sit at room temperature (for about 1 hour) before you
  begin to cook.
  
  TO COOK OUTDOORS, use a covered kettle grill or water smoker. In a
  kettle grill, indriectly cook the brisket over a water pan containing
  a basting liquid of water, orange juice, wine or something similar
  for about 2 hours per pound, refreshing the coals with damp smoking
  chips every couple of hours.  The brisket should have a dark crust
  when finished. If you are using a water smoker, follw the
  manufacturer's instructions. Remove the brisket from the grill and
  let it stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
  
  TO COOK INDOORS, preheat the oven to 200F.  Put the brisket in a
  roasting pan and place in the center of the oven. Roast for 2 hours
  per pound, undisturbed. Remove the brisket from the roasting pan and
  let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.  If you like, combine the
  pan juices with some warm barbecue sauce for serving.
  
  To serve, slice the brisket across the grain.  Place overlapping
  slices on a large platter, drizzle with barbecue sauce and garnish
  with grilled red onions rings.
  
  Yield:  10 to 12 servings.
  
  Author's note:  The trick behind a perfectly moist beef brisket is
  slow, even heat or smoke.  If you have a water smoker and access to
  mesquite chips or hard wood, Texas beef brisket takes on added depth.
  But you can get nice results indoors with your own oven. The Texas
  Dry Rub becomes the basis of a smoky, savory paste. Serve the brisket
  with your favorite barbecue sauce, a side of coleslaw and a garnish
  of sliced, grilled red onions.
  
  Note from me:  I used this recipe on a 3.25 pound eye of round roast
  and let it marinate in the refrigerator for 72 hours. It was
  delicious! The rub was very hot, so I rubbed it off the roast before
  slicing so there was no overkill on heat.  We served two sauces on
  the side: homemade BBQ sauce and horseradish sauce. Great with baked
  beans and homegrown tomato salad!

      3 tb Red wine vinegar
  2 1/2 c  Red wine
      6    Medium onions
      6    Medium carrots

      2 tb Brandy
      1 pn Thyme
      1    Sprigs parsley
      1 pn Rosemary

  chopping board, or use a garlic press; blend with the chopped
  parsley, cloves, and allspice. Put  the meat into a dish,  and add
  the wine vinegar, wine, and garlic spice  mixture.
    Peel  and  thinly slice one third of  the  onions and carrots, add
  to the marinade with a little salt and pepper. Leave for at least 12
  hours turning occasionally. Peel the remaining onions and carrots,
  quarter the onions but leave the carrots  whole.
    Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet,  fry the diced bacon and
  quartered onions  until golden brown, and spoon into a casserole.
  Remove the meat from the marinade,  drain well.
    Brown meat in the oil remaining  in the pan and add to the onions.
  Pour the marinade  liquid and vegetables into the skillet and stir
  well to absorb the last of the oil. Add the whole carrots, brandy,
  and herbs. Cut the zest from the orange and squeeze a little orange
  juice and add this and the zest to the sauce. Season the sauce with a
  little salt and pepper. Pour over the meat and onions, cover the
  casserole. Cook in the center of a slow (350 d F) for 2 1/4 hours. To
  serve, remove the garni.
    This dish is particularly good  when  served  with spaghetti,

  This is quite good.  I didn't peel away the skin - just diced it and
  then removed the skin - was much easier to do this way for me. Reggie

MMMMM-------------------PROVOLONE GARLIC BREAD------------------------
      3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      3    Garlic cloves, peeled,
           -ends removed, minced
      4 lg Thick slices of crusty bread
      4    Slices (1 1/2 ounces each)
           -provolone cheese
    1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
 
  1. Mix tomatoes, green onions, parsley, rosemary, garlic, olive oil
  and vinegar in a shallow bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the
  bowl and let tomatoes marinate at room temperature at least 1 hour,
  but preferably 3 to 4 hours or overnight. Stir occasionally.
  
  2. For garlic bread, mix olive oil and garlic in a small bowl and let
  stand 10 minutes so the flavors blend. Meanwhile, heat broiler. Brush
  one side of each bread piece with the garlic/olive oil mixture, and
  broil, oiled side up, until lightly browned. Place a slice of
  provolone and a generous sprinkling of Parmesan on toasted side of
  each slice, saving a little for garnish. Set the bread aside.
  
  3. Just before serving, heat the broiler. Toast the bread under the
  broiler until cheese is bubbly. To serve, put a piece of the bread in
  a shallow soup bowl. Spoon about 3/4 cup of the tomatoes and marinade
  on or around the edges of the bread. Garnish with more Parmesan and
  serve.

  with tomatoes
  
  In a tomato frenzy? Here's what to do with all those fruits of the
  vine: - Never refrigerate tomatoes; cold temperatures make the flesh
  pulpy and destroy flavor. ~ Peeling tomatoes isn't necessary if
  you're going to use them raw in salads, salsas or on sandwiches; wash
  the skin before you stem and core. - To peel, immerse in boiling
  water for 30 seconds; drain and peel with a paring knife. - To seed,
  cut the tomato in half horizontally. Set a strainer over a bowl and
  gently squeeze the seeds into it. - Or, if you want the shell intact,
  cut off the top 1/2-inch; scoop out seeds and core with a grapefruit
  spoon. - Never cook tomatoes or tomato-based sauces in an aluminum
  pan; they lose their bright color and can pick up an unpleasant taste.

      Title: MARINATED CRUDIT‚S A‹OLI
 Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE MARINADE---------------------------
    300 ml White wine
    300 ml Water
      1    Bay leaf
      1    Sprig thyme
    150 ml Olive oil
      1    Lemon; Juiced and grated
      2 tb White-wine vinegar
      4    Coriander seeds
      4    Peppercorns
    1/2    Dried chilli
           -- soaked in warm water
     15 g  Fresh root ginger
           - (peeled and grated)
      1    Garlic clove; chopped
           Salt

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE A‹OLI----------------------------
      2 lg Garlic cloves; crushed
    300 ml Mayonnaise

MMMMM----------------------VARIOUS CRUDIT‚S---------------------------
 
  *Lightly steamed: baby French beans, mange-tout, broccoli florets,
  baby sweetcorn, 750 g (1 1/2  lb) Raw: yellow peppers, baby carrots,
  cauliflower florets, button mushrooms
  
  For all its simplicity, a‹oli always makes a memorable meal - thick,
  glossy mayonnaise, uncompromisingly garlicky, and aromatic vegetables
  to dip into it. Serve this with warm granary bread and the dish is
  complete.
  
  Boil all the ingredients for the marinade together for 5 minutes.
  Pour over the prepared crudit‚s and refrigerate for 24 hours.
  
  To make the a‹oli, stir the crushed garlic into the mayonnaise and mix
  well. Cover and leave to stand for at least an hour, preferably
  longer, before using.
  
  Most of the vegetables used for the crudit‚s can be eaten whole, but
  slice the peppers into thin strips before serving.

      Title: MARINATED CUCUMBER & RED BELL PEPPER SALAD
 Categories: Digest, Ornish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 oz Dry cellophane or bean
           Thread noodles
      2 c  Peeled, seeded, and sliced
           Cucumbers
      2 c  Thinly sliced red bell
           Peppers (I chopped them into
           Chunks )
      1 c  No-oil Italian dressing or
           Vinaigrette (I used less
           Than 1C -- about 3/4)
      1 tb Freshly minced basil
      1 tb Freshly miced cilantro
    1/8 ts Red hot chili flakes (I made
           My own from dried chilis)
           Lettuce
 
  Drop the noodles into boiling water until done (length of time
  depends on type; read the label). Drain. Toss all ingredients
  together and marinate for at least 1 hour. Serve on a bed of lettuce.
  
  Other tips:
  
  I used 3.5 oz of noodles, and less dressing. The chili makes it hot
  so if you don't like spicy, it would be fine to leave it out. You may
  want to break the noodles a little before cooking (but not too much).
  I made the mistake of not breaking them and ended up having to cut
  them a little in order to get my ingredients to combine properly.
  
  This salad is even better the next day. I imagine it travels nicely
  because it isn't too soupy.

      Title: MARINATED EGGPLANT IN OLIVE OIL
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 md Eggplants (about 3 1/2 lbs.
           Total)
    1/2 c  Salt
      1 ts White vinegar
      1 ts Extra virgin olive oil [go
           For the greenest you can
           Find]
      3 c  Regular olive oil [all
           Extra virgin would be
           Prohibitive for too many]
    1/4 c  Chopped garlic
      1 ts Crushed red pepper
      1 tb Dried oregano OR
  2 1/2 tb Fresh oregano if available
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Bill Birner Originally from: La Cucina di
  Andrea's New Orleans Extra Virgin Recipes 1. Slice the skins off the
  eggplants, and slice them about 1/4 inch thick from top to bottom.
  Then slice across to get pieces the size of French fries. Put the
  eggplant strips in a bowl and toss with the 1/2 cup of salt.
  
  2. Move the eggplant strips into a colander, arraying them in a
  relatively uniform layer up the sides. Put a bowl the same size as
  the colander inside the colander and weigh it down with three or so
  pounds of weight. [I find a foil covered common solid brick is a
  handy kitchen tool.] Put the entire apparatus in the sink to drain
  for 45 minutes. This will remove any bitterness from the eggplant.
  
  3. Rinse the salt off the eggplant with cold water. Drain it well,
  then SQUEEZE it dry. Put the eggplant in a bowl with the vinegar, and
  marinate it for 30 minutes. [It will return to shape like a wet
  sponge.]
  
  4. Drain the vinegar from the eggplant and squeeze it dry again. Put
  the eggplant into a bowl with all the other ingredients.
  
  5. Pour the contents into a canning jar. Make SURE there is enough
  olive oil to completely cover all the eggplant about 1/2 inch deep.
  Tightly seal and refrigerate the jar. Marinate for at least a week;
  The ideal time is actually three months, and the eggplant will keep
  getting better even after that.

      Title: MARINATED FLANK STEAK W/LEMON HERB BUTTER
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Flank steak, 1 to 1 1/2lbs
    1/4 c  Ea. salad oil & dry red wine
      1 tb Worcestershire
      2 ts Soy sauce
      1 ts Dry mustard
      1    Clove garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Summer savory leaves

MMMMM------------------------FOR GARNISH-----------------------------
      1    Watercress sprigs
 
  Lemon herb butter:  Beat 1/3 cup soft butter until fluffy; gradually
  beat in 1 1/2 T lemon juice until well combined. Mix in 3 T each
  finely chopped parsley and watercress, 1 tsp. worcestershire sauce,
  1/4 tsp. tarragon and dash white pepper.  Shape into a roll or cube,
  wrap, and chill to blend flavors. Place steak in shallow dish. In a
  covered jar or blender, shake together oil, wine, worcestershire
  sauce, soy sauce, mustard, garlic, salt, sugar, and savory. Pour over
  steak, turning to coat well. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hrs. or more,
  turning once or twice. Remove steak, reserving marinade.  Place on a
  rack in a broiling pan. Broil about 4" from heat, until well browned
  (about 6 minutes per side for rare), brushing occasionally with
  marinade.  Slice thinly, cutting diagonally. Serve topped with thin
  slices of lemon herb butter. Garnish with watercress. TIPS: Flank
  steak will be most tender if cooked only to rare or medium rare stage
  of doneness.  Cooked more, it tends to become rather tough. You can
  substitute 2 T cider vinegar for 1/4 cup dry red wine.

      Title: MARINATED FRIED GREEN TOMATOES
 Categories: Vegetables, Diana
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Green tomatoes
      2 c  Water
      1 tb English mustard -- powder
      4 tb Tomato paste
      2 tb Peanut oil -- divided
      4 tb Cider vinegar
      4 tb Soy sauce
      4 tb Honey
      2 ts Salt -- divided
      1 ts Celery salt
      2 ds Cayenne
      5 tb Cornstarch
      1 c  Flour
 
  Prepare and start marinating the tomatoes early in the day. Cut the
  stem button out of each tomato and cut it in half lengthwise. Trim
  off a small slice on the round side of each tomatoe half and discard
  it. Then cut each half, lengthwise, into 2 slices, each about
      1/2    inch thick.  Pack the tomato slices into a bowl. In a
  saucepan, slowly stir the 2 cups of water into the mustard powder and
  tomato paste until the mixture is smooth.  Add the 2 tablespoons of
  oil, the vinegar, soy sauce, honey, the 2 teaspoons of salt, the
  celery salt and cayenne. Bring the mixture to simmer over medium heat
  then simmer it, uncovered, for 5 minutes.  Pour the hot marinade over
  the tomatoes in the bowl and set a saucer with a weight upon it on
  them to keep them submerged, and allow them to marinate at least 6
  hours. Just before serving time, drain the tomatoes in a large
  strainer set over a bowl. Measure out the drained marinade liquid and
  add enough water to it if necessary to bring the total measurement to
  3 cups.  Dissolve the cornstarch in the liquid and bring it to simmer
  in a heavy saucepan over medium heat while stirring constantly, with
  a rubber spatula.  When the liquid simmers, reduce the heat slightly
  and simmer 2 minutes longer, still stirring constantly. The sauce
  will be very thick and is meant to be so. Keep the sauce warm,
  covered with a trimmed piece of paper towel and lid, over very low
  heat until serving. Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a heavy, 10-inch frying
  pan over medium high heat. There will be around 8 tomato slices per
  serving so work in batches of 8. Meanwhile, lightly salt bothsides of
  each slice, dredge it in a bowl of the flour and set it on a plate.
  (Do not dredge more than 8 slices ahead of time, they get soggy.)
  Fry the floured tomato slices for2 to 2 1/2 minutes on each side
  until they are golden brown. Do not overcook them. They retain their
  heat for a long time and consequently continue to cook after they are
  removed from the pan.  We want them to remain crisp. Drain the fried
  slices for a moment on paper towels. Transfer them to a warm dinner
  plate and serve the fried green tomatoes, immediately, along with a
  small, warm bowl of the equally divided marinade sauce.

      Title: MARINATED LAMB
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Red wine
    1/2 c  Soy sauce (up
           -to 3/4 C)
      1 tb Rosemary leaves,
           -crushed
      1 tb Black pepper, fresh
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed
      1    Half leg of lamb,
           -butterflied
 
  Mix together all of the ingredients except the lamb. Place the lamb
  in a bowl or pan that will not be corroded by the marinade (a glass
  9x13 pan works well).
  
  Pour most of the marinade over the lamb.  Swish the lamb around and
  get it soaked on both sides.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator
  for at least several hours, turning occasionally.
  
  Start a fire in the grill and get the coals very warm but not flaming.
  Place lamb on grill about 3-4 inches from the coals. Cook on this
  side for 20 minutes, basting with the extra marinade occasionally.
  Turn the meat over and cook another 20 minutes.
  
  After 10 minutes on the second side, start checking for doneness.
  Contrary to many people's ideas, lamb should not be well done but
  should still be a little pink. When done, slice thin and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- This is the best recipe I have
  ever had for lamb. It really brings out the flavor wonderfully. It
  came originally from the "Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook."
  
  A wonderful side dish for this is the Spanish recipe for Garlic fried
  potatoes.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  For the meat, you need a half leg of lamb which has been
  butterflied. A good butcher can do this for you but don't be afraid
  of trying it yourself. To butterfly the leg, take a sharp knife and
  start at the side and work towards the bone.  Once you have found the
  bone, work along it so you have one side completely slit and then cut
  out the bone. Depending on which end of the leg you have, you may
  need to puzzle over some of the weirdnesses of the bone shape. Don't
  discard the bone, it makes interesting soup.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 40 minutes
  cooking. : Precision:  no need to measure.

           -thin (1/8-inch) slices

MMMMM------------------------MEAT SKEWERS-----------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Sirloin tip
     12 oz Pineapple chunks
 
  Combine the ingredients for the marinade; stir well.
  
  Cut meat into bite-size chunks and place on skewers with 2 or 3
  chunks of pineapple in between the meat pieces. Marinate the skewers
  overnight, in a covered container, in the refrigerator.
  
  To cook, broil the meat for about 10 minutes (depends on the size of
  the chunks).  When the weather permits, grilling it outdoors on
  skewers is even better.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Broiled beef in a Chinese marinade -- After frequenting a local
  Chinese restaurant, I finally asked for the recipe for the marinade
  for the meat that came on skewers on the pu pu platter. I was given a
  list of ingredients with instructions like "heavy on this, light on
  this". I devised my own amounts from this list. I served it to my
  family and they enjoyed it, so I feel confident sending it to
  mod.recipes.
  
  *  You may need to double the marinade recipe.  I use a Tupperware
  container made especially for marinating. Any container will do, but
  it's tough having to turn over all those skewers.
  
  *  The hoisin sauce, ginger root and light soy sauce should be
  available in any good grocery store. Comments, revisions and/or
  additions will be appreciated.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 12 hours marinating, 10 minutes
  cooking. : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: MARINATED NIGARI TOFU
 Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Medium-sized cloves garlic,
           -minced
      2 tb Chinese sesame oil
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Mirin
      1    To 2 teaspoons brown sugar
           -(to taste)
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
    1/4 ts Salt
           Crushed red pepper, to taste
           -(optional)
      1 lb Nigari tofu
 
  "Some people love their tofu plain.  Others find it dull unless it is
  marinated in strong delicious flavors, as in this recipe. Firm tofu
  marinates beautifully. (Softer varieties contain -- and thus expel --
  more water, causing the marinade to become dilute.)
  
  Nigari tofu is one of the firmest types available. You can find it in
  some Asian groceries and in many natural food stores. It usually comes
  vacuum-packed or in a container of water. If you can't get tofu
  labeled "nigari," just use the firmest you can find. Mirin is
  Japanese cooking sake, available in most Asian grocery stores. If you
  can't find it, substitute a sweet wine or sherry. (my note:  I use
  regular "hard" tofu from the grocery store, slice it and let it drain
  for a while. Also, I do not use the mirin or any substitute with
  alcohol, and it all still comes out great.)
  
  1. Combine all ingredients except tofu in a shallow pan or bowl. Whisk
  until well combined. (my note: I use a 9x13 baking dish.)
  
  2. Cut the tofu into 1/2 x 1 1/2-inch pieces.  Lay them out in the
  marinade in such a way as to allow maximum contact with the sauce.
  Marinate at room temperature for several hours (provided the room is
  not too hot, in which case, cover them and let them marinate in the
  refrigerator). Turn them and move them around every 20 to 30 minutes
  or so, and tilt the pan periodically, so the flavors of the marinade
  can make the rounds and the tofu gets deeply an evenly penetrated.
  
  3. After the tofu has been marinating for several hours you may either
  serve it at room temperature, or cover it tightly, and refrigerate
  until serving time. (It will keep for several days if it is fresh to
  begin with.)
  
  My Notes:  I am the only one here that likes tofu, so this is nice in
  that I don't have to eat it up all at once! It is delicious, and I
  like the pieces in with a salad, plopped onto noodles, or just by
  itself. If you don't like tofu, Karin, I'm sure someone else will
  enjoy the recipe ;-)

      Title: MARINATED PEPPERS
 Categories: Canning, Preserving, Vegetables
      Yield: 9 Half-pints
 
      4 lb Firm peppers*
      1 c  Bottled lemon juice
      2 c  White vinegar (5 percent)
      1 tb Oregano leaves
      1 c  Olive or salad oil
    1/2 c  Chopped onions
      2    Garlic cloves; quartered
           -- (optional)
      2 tb Prepared horseradish
           -- (optional)
 
  Yield: About 9 half-pints.
  
  (Bell, Hungarian, Banana, or Jalapeno)
  
  * Note: It is possible to adjust the intensity of pickled jalapeno
  peppers by using all hot jalapeno peppers (hot style), or blending
  with sweet and mild peppers (medium or mild style).
  
  For hot style: Use 4 lbs jalapeno peppers.
  
  For medium style: Use 2 lbs jalapeno peppers and 2 lbs sweet and mild
  peppers.
  
  For mild style: Use 1 lb jalapeno peppers and 3 lbs sweet and mild
  peppers.
  
  Procedure: Select your favorite pepper. Caution: If you select hot
  peppers, wear rubber or plastic gloves while handling them or wash
  hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching your face.
  
  Peppers may be left whole. Large peppers may be quartered. Wash,
  slash two to four slits in each pepper, and blanch in boiling water
  or blister in order to peel tough-skinned hot peppers.
  
  Peppers may be blistered using one of the following methods: Oven or
  broiler method: Place peppers in a hot oven (400 degree F) or broiler
  for 6-8 minutes or until skins blister. Range-top method: Cover hot
  burner, either gas or electric, with heavy wire mesh. Place peppers
  on burner for several minutes until skins blister.
  
  Allow peppers to cool. Place in pan and cover with a damp cloth. This
  will make peeling the peppers easier. After several minutes of
  cooling, peel each pepper. Flatten whole peppers. Mix all remaining
  ingredients in a saucepan and heat to boiling. Place 1/4 garlic clove
  (optional) and 1/4 teaspoon salt in each half pint or 1/2 teaspoon
  per pint. Fill jars with peppers, add hot, well-mixed oil/pickling
  solution over peppers, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.
  
  Adjust lids and process according to the recommendations in Table 1.
  
  Table 1. Recommended process time for Marinated Peppers in a
  boiling-water canner.
  
  Style of Pack: Raw.  Jar Size: Half-pints and Pints. Process Time at
  Altitudes of 0 - 1,000 ft: 15 min.
                         1,001 - 3,000 ft: 20 min.

 Categories: Foreign, Seafood, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           INGREDIENTS:
  1 1/2 lb Shark steaks
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Rice or wine vinegar
           -(balsamic is *delightful*
           -here!)
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Oil
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      1    Clove garlick, pressed or
           -minced
    1/2 ts Freshly-ground black pepper
 
  minced green onions and parsley
  
  (TIP):  Fish should be cooked only until it flakes easily. Check it
  often to prevent overcooking, which will not only make it rubbery, it
  will render it tasteless. A good way to check is to check it for
  opacity. When it has turned from translucent to white and opaque it's
  done. It will finish cooking  on its own with residual heat if
  removed from the heat source.
  
  Fish  is  a high protein but low-calorie main dish.
   By  using  a light marinade  you  eliminate rich butter sauces and
  still maintain the delicate flavor.
  
  Cut the shark steaks into service-sized pieces.
   Place them in  a glass dish.   Combine the soy sauce, vinegar, lemon
  juice,  oil parsley, garlick and black pepper. Pour the marinade over
  the fish and marinate for half an hour, turning at least once.
  
  Remove  the fish (reserving the marinade)  and broil 4 to 5 inches
  from the heat - about four minutes a side.
   Brush with the marinade before turning.
  
  Serve with minced green onions and parsley. Accompaniments: Rice and
  vegetable pilaf,  leaf lettuce tossed with parsley-lemon dressing, and
  French or Italian sourdough bread.

      3 oz Onion, sliced

      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Lemon juice
      3 oz Olive oil
      4 oz Wine, white
 
  Cut the meat into small cubes.  In a bowl, preferably earthenware,
  mix the marinade ingredients well and add the meat, mix again, cover
  and leave to marinate for 24 to 48 hours. (He doesn't say to
  refrigerate but I would certainly do so.  For the curious, the recipe
  actually calls for marinating in a *kioupi* or earthenware storage
  jar rather than a bowl. This would probably keep the ingredients
  cooler.) When ready to cook, thread the meat on 18 to 24 skewers.
  Grill over embers of vine branches (!). Serve hot.

      1    Lemon grass stalk
      1    Lime leaf
      1    Garlic clove
      2    Scallions
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Chili paste
      1 ts Curry powder, hot or mild
      1 ts Tumeric
    1/2    Hot red pepper, chopped
    1/2 c  Thick coconut milk
           Salt to taste

MMMMM-------------------------VEGETABLES------------------------------

           Red or green pepper
           Cabbage
           Celery
           Green onions
 
  Coarsely chop the lemon grass and lime leaf. Peel the garlic and
  onions and chop. Add these plus the spices and the red pepper to a
  food processor. Pour in the coconut milk and blend to a thick paste.
  (If you can't find thick coconut milk, use regular but pour off and
  save the thin liquid on top and use the thick cream on the bottom of
  the can.)
  
  Spread the marinade on both sides of the steaks. It should be like a
  crust on the meat. Let stand in the fridge for 3 hours to overnight.
  Save the remaining marinade.
  
  Grill the steaks on a hot grill to medium (or as desired). While the
  steaks are grilling, stir-fry a selection of veggies in a wok until
  tender crisp. Remove veggies and keep warm. Add the saved marinade to
  the wok and add the remaining coconut milk or the thin liquid poured
  off the top. Simmer until slightly reduced, or if too thick add a
  little water or fish sauce. Salt to taste, and return the veggies to
  the wok; stir to coat.
  
  Slice the meat across the grain into 1/2" slices. Arrange on top of
  hot steamed rice or rice noodles. Top with veggies and sauce. Garnish
  with a small dollop of chili paste if desired.
  
  The tumeric gives this dish a wonderful bright yellow color. You can
  substitute chicken breasts or pork steaks for the strip loin.

      Title: MARINATED TOFU
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 pk Firm tofu, 14-to-18 oz each
    1/2 oz Dried wild mushrooms
           - porcini or shiitake
      1 c  Water
      2 ts Dried oregano or marjoram
      2    Garlic cloves; sliced
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Sherry vinegar
           -=OR=- Red Wine Vinegar
    1/2 c  Red wine
    1/2 c  Tamari soy sauce
      4    Cloves
    1/2 ts Salt
           Several twists black pepper
 
  CUT THE TOFU INTO SLABS 1-inch thick--firm tofu often comes in pieces
  that size--and drain them: Set them on a bread board or the back of a
  baking sheet and raise 1 end; point the lower end toward the sink to
  let the water drain off. Cover the tofu with another tray and weigh
  it down with something heavy, such as a few cans of tomatoes. Let the
  tofu drain for about 1/2 hour. This will remove excess water and
  allow the marinade to penetrate without being diluted. While the tofu
  is draining, prepare the marinade. Simmer the mushrooms in the water
  for 15 minutes. Heat a small heavy skillet and toast the oregano or
  marjoram slowly until it is fragrant. Add the oregano and the
  remaining ingredients to the pot with the mushrooms. Bring to a boil,
  and simmer slowly a few minutes more. Remove the tofu from the
  draining board and arrange it in a single layer in a square or
  rectangular non-corrosive pan. Strain the marinade through a coffee
  filter or paper towel and pour it over the tofu. Cover with plastic
  or a lid and refrigerate at least 1 day, preferably longer.

  My daughter makes a wonderful marinated marinaded stir fry. She
  marinades the Mari-Nu low fat tofu and veggies in soy sauce, garlic
  and onions. You can cook the marinade for a few minutes to get the
  flavors of the garlic and onions.  Just pour over pieces of tofu and
  any veggies you may have on hand or like.
  
  Cook the veggies first, add in some of the marinade (I steam them in
  the microwave).  I put everything in a non stick frying pan ( I think
  my daughter does this as well). When cooked, we serve it over brown
  basmati rice.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lg Onions, chopped finely
      5 oz Wholemeal breadcrumbs
      4 oz Cheddar cheese, grated
           -(and vegetarian, of course)
    1/4 ts Mustard powder
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Salt (optional)
 
  Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl adding a sprinkling
  of water or milk if it doesn't stick together (the original recipe
  uses and egg yolk but I don't). If you've got a food
  blender/processor everything will stick together better.
  
  Take a large spoonful of the mixture and dip it into flour then roll
  it out into a sausage (or whatever shape you fancy). Coat your hands
  in flour too so it doesn't stick to you so much.
  
  Then shallow fry them for 5-10 mins - extra virgin olive oil if you
  can (it smells sooooo good)
  
  If you've got too many sausages, cover refrigerate them - they'll
  keep for a day or two.  Or fry them anyway - they're just as good
  cold.

      Title: MARIQUITAS DE PLANTANOS (GREEN PLANTAIN CHIPS
 Categories: Snacks, Cuba, Update
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 lg Green plantains, peeled and
           -cut into paper-thin slices
           Peanut or vegetable oil for
           -deep frying

           -in a bowl, cover them with
           -cold water, and
 
  soak 30 minutes. (If you are frying right away, you do not need to
  soak in water.) 2. Drain the slices and pat dry with paper towels. In
  a frying pan or deep fryer over medium-high heat, heat 2 to 3 inches
  of oil to 375 degrees, or until a slice of plantain sizzles when it
  touches the oil, and fry the plantain chips a handful at a time,
  turning them with a slotted spoon until they are golden brown and
  crisp. Do not fry too many chips at once, or the oil temperature will
  fall and the chips will be soggy rather than crisp. Drain on a
  paper-towel-lined platter, transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle with
  salt, and serve hot. Makes 2 to 2 1/2 cups of chips Mary Urrutia

      2 tb Pure olive oil
      1    Large onion, diced
      2    Large ripe tomatoes, peeled,
           Seeded, coarsely chopped

  Clean the clams by scrubbing them thoroughly with a wire brush,
  removing any beard or barnacles. Then place them in a large pot with
  1 gallon of water or enough to cover, and 1/3 cup salt. Allow the
  clams to remain for 20 minutes during which time they will expel the
  sand inside. Continue this process, changing the water at least two
  more times. The mussels are cleaned in a similar manner, but you must
  leave them in the water for at least 2 hours. Throw away any clams or
  mussels that float or are not tightly closed. Heat the olive oil in
  the bottom of a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the
  onion, tomatoes, garlic, coriander, salt, peppers, and saffron and
  cook, stirring, until the onions have softened, but are not brown.
  Add the fish and shellfish to the onion mixture. Cover with water and
  bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, or
  until the shellfish open. Discard any clams or mussels that do not
  open. Serve hot.

      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 lg Carrot, scrubbed & diced
      1 md Green pepper, diced
    1/2 c  Frozen corn &/or peas
      1    3" piece ginger, sliced
    1/2 ts Chili pieces
           Soy sauce
           Salt & pepper, to taste
 
  Ensure that the rice has been cooked ahead of time & is well cooled.
  
  Heat about 2 to 3 tb vegetable oil in a wok.  When hot, add onions &
  garlic & fry for 3 minutes.  Add the carrots & stir-fry for 2
  minutes. Add the rest of the vegetables & continue to stir-fry for 2
  or 3 minutes. Toss in the chili pieces & ginger root.  Cook for a few
  seconds. Carefully stir in the cold rice.  Lower heat & continue to
  cook, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes.  Add enough soy sauce to
  coat the rice & cook for a further 5 minutes on low heat, stirring
  often to prevent sticking. Season if desired with salt & pepper.
  Serve when heated through.
  
  This goes great with spicy tofu dishes or works well on its own as a
  main dish in its own right.
  
  If you desire something hotter, add more chili pieces. Use pieces
  rather than powder because they are hotter.
  
  For a variation, I sometimes toss in a few strips of tofu just before
  adding the spices.

    1/4 lb Jack Cheese (sliced thin)
 
  Preheat oven to to 350 degrees F.  Shed the zucchini through the large
  holes of the grater, then squeeze it firmly a handful at a time to
  extract much of the juice (which would make the dish watery if left
  in). Discard the juice, or add it to soup or sauce, or drink it. Toss
  the squeezed zucchini with the green onion and set aside.
  Heat the butter in a skillet over moderate heat.  Toss the chicken
  breasts in the flour mixture, shaking off so the excess falls off,
  then cook them in the butter for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side,
  until lightly browned. Arrange the chicken in a single layer in a
  buttered casserole and cover each with a mound of the zucchini
  mixture. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and cover with slices
  of cheese. Bake uncovered for about 20 minutes, until the cheese is
  lightly browned and the chicken is cooked through.

  Mix cheese, celery, walnuts, green onion, lemon juice, cayenne and

  adjusted to taste, but you don't want to overpower the other flavors,
  especially the salmon.  I figure if half your guests complain it's
  too hot, and half say it could have been hotter, it's about right.
  
  Place from  to 1 tsp. of the cheese mixture on the end of one of the
  salmon strips, sprinkle with black pepper, and roll up jellyroll
  style. These steps can be done a couple hours ahead of time, just
  cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
  
  To serve, arrange crackers on serving tray.  Top each one with a

      Title: MARK'S VERSION OF FALAFELS
 Categories: Appetizers, Middle east, Snacks, Lunch, Mark's
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      2 c  Chick peas
      4 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      1 sm Onion, minced
      1 tb Coriander
  1 1/2 tb Cumin
           Several dashes tabasco
      3 tb Wholewheat flour
           Salt & pepper
    1/4 c  Parsley, minced
           Stock, as needed
 
  Soak chick peas, rinse well, cover with fresh water, bring to a boil &
  simmer until very tender.  Depending on how fresh the chick peas are
  will determine how long this will take. Give them about 1 1/2 hours.
  Drain well & set aside to cool.
  
  When cool, place chick peas in food processor bowl & blend until very
  smooth.  If you have a large enough bowl, add the rest of the
  ingredients, except the stock, & mix in the blender. If the bowl is
  not large enough, you will have to do this in batches.  Then add the
  ingredients in order, mixing well after each addition. Add a little
  stock if the mixture appears too dry or looks as if it is not going
  to hold together very well. Cover & set aside for 30 minutes.
  
  Shape into patties.  If the patties do not hold together very well,
  you may want to add a little more flour, but be careful, you do not
  want to make them too floury. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet &
  gently flatten. This amount should make 15 to 18 patties, so make
  them a reasonable size. Preheat the oven to 350F. Bake the falafel
  patties for 5 minutes, remove trays, flip the patties & return to the
  oven for another 5 minutes. Remove from trays & cool on wire racks.
  
  To serve: Heat some olive oil in a good heavy skillet, you can
  choose: I use 2 tb of olive oil, or you could deep fry them in a wok.
  If using the wok method, crumble one dried red chile into the oil as
  it is heating. When the oil is hot, fry the falafel patties until
  golden. Flip & fry the other side.  Remove from the oil, drain &
  serve.
  
  Either serve the falafel as part of a Middle Eastern platter
  including some baba ganouj, hummus, tabouleh, lettuce, tomatoes,
  green onions & pita. Or, make up a sauce using tahini & hot sauce,
  warm a pita bread, slice the top off, spread the tahini paste in the
  pita, drop in two patties, cover with lettuce, tomatoes & green
  onions. Either a great snack or a main meal.

      Title: MARKET SALAD WITH PARMESAN BRITTLE - BUON'APP
 Categories: Vegetables, Salads, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 bn Arugula
      1 sm Radicchio head
      1 sm Romaine lettuce

MMMMM------------------------VINAIGRETTE-----------------------------
      2 tb Red wine vinegar
      2 ts Dijon mustard
      1 ts Garlic, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Olive oil

MMMMM----------------------PARMESAN BRITTLE---------------------------
      1 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
    1/4 ts Paprika
      1 ts Black pepper, fresh ground
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Use lettuces that have flavour to stand up to the rich, sharp taste
  of the brittle and the bite of the dressing. Arugula is a spicy leafy
  green similar in flavour to watercress. If you can't find arugula,
  use watercress in its place. 1. Tear lettuce into bite sized pieces
  and combine in bowl. 2. (Vinaigrette) In a separate bowl, whisk
  together vinegar, mustard and garlic. Slowly whisk in oil. Toss with
  salad 3. Place salad on 6 plates and top with 2 parmesan brittles.
  Serve rest seperately. PARMESAN BRITTLE: These delectable biscuits
  are wonderful with the salad but can also be served with soups or as
  an hors d'oeuvre. Let them cool for a few minutes before removing
  them from cookie sheet. They are quite brittle, so if they break,
  don't worry. Serve them anyway. 1. Preheat oven to 375F(190C). By
  hand or in a food processor, cut butter into flour. Grate your own
  Parmesan cheese if possible - consistency will be better. Mix in
  Parmesan, paprika, pepper and salt. Form into a ball. 2. On a floured
  board with a floured rolling pin, roll dough out into a rectangle
  approx 12x7 inch (30x18cm) in size. Cut into 1 inch (2.5cm) strips.
  Lay strips onto a cookie sheet. Bake on middle rack for 9-10 minutes
  or until strips are pale gold. Cook on cookie sheet. Serve with
  salad. (Makes 10-12)

  Get the ring of a springform cake or a cake ring and trace the
  pattern onto some wax paper.
  
  Melt the milk chocolate over a double boiler, add the praline
  (praline is hazlenuts ground with sugar) and the chopped almonds.
  Spread on the sheet of waxed paper and freeze.
  
  Whip the whites and sugar together as hard as they will go. Gently
  incorperate the yolks, and then incorperate the flour/cocoa mix.
  Spread or pipe batter onto sheets in shapes larger than the ring.
  Bake at 375-390 till they are done (tell by looking at them and
  feeling them).
  
  Chop the bitter chocolate and chocolate for the mousse. Boil the
  creme and pour it over the chocolate. Add the butter.
  
  Whip the cream to almost hard peak, and when the chocolate truffle has
  cooled, add the whipped cream and incorperate.
  
  Boil the sugar and water, add the alcohol.
  
  Cut rocher chocolate to fit into cake circle.
  
  Put the bottom layer of the cake on a flat surface. Put the circle
  over it and press down, so that the edges are cut off and the center
  is inside the circle with a good seal. Brush syrup on bottom layer.
  Put some mousse in and then put the layer of rocher chocolate in.
  
  Put another layer of mousse in. Brush top layer with syrup, and put
  it into the cake. Put cake in fridge for a hour or so. Remove the
  ring from the cake.
  
  Boil the cream/glucose and pour it over the chopped chocolate for the
  glaze (glucose is sort of like cooked sugar or very heavy corn syrup.
  I reduce some corn syrup and sugar till it's very thick but still
  liquidy when cooled). Add the butter to the glaze, mix, and pour over
  cake. Spread with a spatula to cover the entire cake.

           -Robbie Shelton
      2    Envelopes Unflavored
           -Gelatin
      2 tb -Cold Water
    1/2 c  -Boiling Water
      2 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Flour
    3/4 lb Chocolate for dipping
           Regal Icing
 
  Put gelatin in top of double boiler; add cold water. When gelatin
  softens, add boiling water and stil well. Add sugar and salt. Put
  over boiling water and stir until sugar dissolves completely.
  
  Pour into large bowl of electric mixer and beat at high speed until
  misture is thick but not as stiff as beaten egg whites. Add vanilla.
  
  Meanwhile, spread flour 2" deep in a large pan.  Push an egg (in
  shell) into the flour  at intervals, making hollow spaces in which to
  mold the marshmallow mixture.
  
  Drop marshmallow mixture into the flour molds. Sprinkle flour lightly
  over top and put in cold place until set. Remove mixture from one
  mold and you have a half-egg. Trim the flat side of marshmallow
  half-egg to make it even.  You can dip it in melted chocolate to
  cover and decorate with Regal Icing.
  
  Or you can put two halves together to make an egg, as follows: Dip the
  rounded part of a half-egg in melted chocolate; set aside to cool,
  flat (uncoated) side down. Trim flat side of second half-egg (to make
  it even), lift from mold and completely coat with chocolate. Quickly
  press its flat side against the flat side of the cooled half-egg and
  you have a whole egg. The chocolate will hold it together.
  
  When chocolate-coated eggs are cool, trim with Regal Icing put
  through cake decorator tube.  Make ruffles around them to cover seam
  where the two halves join and to provide decoration. Write names of
  children on their eggs with the icing, or decorate with tiny designs
  pressed through fine tips of a cake decorator tube. Frosting my be
  left white or tinted in pastel colors. Makes 13 eggs (or 26
  half-eggs).

  ~=> Vanilla Sugar (Granulated or Powdered) Simply bury one, two or
  even more vanilla beans in a jar of sugar and cover it with a tight
  lid. If you want to the beans to flavor the sugar more quickly, cut
  them lengthwise with kitchen shears.  do this over the container of
  sugar so the tiny seeds ~ source of much of the flavor - will land
  where they belong.

 Categories: Chocolate, Cookies, Holidays
      Yield: 100 Cookies
 
MMMMM-------------------CHOCOLATE TUILE BATTER------------------------
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter; room
           -temperature
    2/3 c  Confectioner's sugar
      4 lg Egg whites
      1 c  All purpose flour
      3 tb Dutch process cocoa powder

MMMMM---------------------WHITE TUILE BATTER--------------------------
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter; room
           -temperature
    2/3 c  Confectioner's sugar
      4 lg Egg whites
      1 c  All purpose flour
 
  Traditionally, tuiles are thin, crisp almond cookies that are gently
  molded over a rolling pin or arched form while they are still warm.
  Once set, their shape ressembles the curved French roofing tiles for
  which they're named. Create an autumnal variation on the classic
  French tuile cookie by shaping them with a leaf- shaped stencil. The
  basic tuile dough of sugar, nuts, eggs, flour, and butter can be
  enhanced by flavorings such as chocolate, vanilla, lemon or orange.
  These delicate cookies are delicious served alone, or along side a
  bowl of ice cream.
  
  To make leaf-shaped tuiles, Martha Stewart cuts stencils shaped like
  maple and oak leaves from the tops of plastic containers. She places
  the stencils on a baking sheet lined with a nonstick baking mat. She
  forms the cookies by spreading a thin layer of dough inside the open
  part of the stencil. After removing the stencil form, she decorates
  each leaf cookie by piping "veins" with a pastry bag filled with a
  contrasting dough before baking. Work quickly when removing the
  cookies from the oven because if you wait too long the cookies will
  harden on the baking sheet and won't be flexible enough to curve over
  the rolling pin. If this happens, you can return the baking sheet to
  the oven for a few seconds, and try again. This recipe uses
  Dutch-process cocoa, known for its rich flavor and color.
  
  1. Sift flour with cocoa, and set aside.
  
  2. In bowl of an electric standing mixer with paddle attachment, beat
  butter and sugar on medium, until well combined, about 2 minutes.
  Beat in egg whites, one at a time, beating for 4 minutes after each
  addition. Add the flour-and-cocoa mixture, and mix until just
  combined.
  
  3. Reserve 1/2 cup batter; place in a pastry bag fitted with a #2 tip
  and set aside for piping white tuile cookies.

 Categories: Chocolate, Cookies
      Yield: 50 4-inch coo
 
      2 c  Unsalted butter (4 sticks)
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      3 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
      4 ea Eggs, add one at a time
      2 ts Pure vanilla extract
  3 1/2 c  All purpose flour
      2 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Best quality chocolate chips
 
  Alexis Stewart developed this chocolate-chip cookie recipe for her
  mother, Martha, when she was twelve years old. Best enjoyed with a
  cold glass of milk, these flat buttery cookies combine perfect
  amounts of crunch and chewiness. Use an ice-cream scoop to make
  evenly sized cookies. If cookies harden before you have a chance to
  remove them from the baking sheet, return the sheet to the oven for a
  few seconds to soften the dough for easier removal.
  
   1. Heat oven to 375 B0. Cream butter until smooth; add sugars. Beat
  in eggs and vanilla. Sift together dry ingredients, and slowly beat
  into wet mixture. Fold in chocolate-chips.  Chill dough until firm,
  at least
       15    minutes.
  
  2. Drop 2 to 3 tablespoons chilled batter per cookie onto a
  well-greased baking sheets lined with baking mats or parchment; space
  batter about 2 inches apart for spreading.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes,
  until golden. Remove from baking sheets, and allow to cool on baking
  racks.

           - ounces; coarsely chopped
      1 c  Skor toffee bits (5 1/2
           -ounces)
 
  Martha Stewart always thought it would be difficult to improve on her
  own oatmeal cookie recipe until she tasted Torie Hallock 92s
  exquisite oatmeal cookies filled with toffee pieces, chocolate
  chunks, and dried cherries. An outstanding baker and cook, Torie
  lives in rural Maine and still manages to locate the finest and most
  delicious ingredients to use in her cooking.
  
  Torie 92s oatmeal-cookie dough can be baked immediately, refrigerated
  for 1-2 days, and frozen for up to a month.
  
  1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Sift together the flour and baking soda
  and set aside. In an electric mixer, using a paddle attachment cream
  the butter and sugars on medium high speed until light and fluffy,
  about 2 to 3 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl one or twice
  during mixing. Add egg; mix on high speed to combine. Add vanilla
  extract; mix to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
  
  2. Add the sifted flour in additions on a low speed until well
  combined. On low speed, add the oatmeal, cherries, chocolate and
  toffee pieces and mix to combine.
  
  3. Divide the dough into three equal portions and roll into logs using
  plastic wrap, approximately 1 1/2-inch in diameter. Dough can be
  frozen, chilled in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days or baked
  immediately. Cut logs into 3/4-inch pieces. Bake on parchment-lined
  baking sheets, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the
  oven, and transfer to a baking rack to cool.

      Title: MARTHA'S CHILES RELLENOS
 Categories: Ethnic, Tex-mex, Dairy
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Monterey Jack cheese
      1 x  Whole chiles; fresh or cannd

MMMMM------------------FOR EVERY 2 CHILES ALLOW-----------------------
      1 ea Egg;separated
      1 tb Flour
      1 x  Oil-1 1/2" deep in skillet

MMMMM-----------------RANCHERO SAUCE-SEE RECIPE----------------------
 
  Cut the cheese into oblong pieces about an inch wide and 2 inches
  long, and place inside the peeled chiles. (see note following
  directions) Beat the eggwhites until stiff. Beat the yolks in a
  separate bowl, combining with the flour. Lightly fold the yolk
  mixture into the whites. Drop the peppers into the mixture, one by
  one. Heat the oil in the skillet to moderately hot, then picking the
  chiles up with a spoon, place them in the pan, and fry until golden
  brown on both sides. Serve piping hot, topped with Ranchero Sauce.
  (recipe to be posted) Note: If you are using fresh chiles, they must
  be peeled, as the batter will not adhere to the slick skins of the
  chiles. Do this by charring the chiles either over an open flame or
  under the broiler. Then steam them in a hot towel, and when they are
  cool enough to touch, remove the skins. I got this recipe from Martha
  Campbell, a mexican senorita who had married a friend of ours, and
  was our neighbor back in the '50s. She was an excellent cook, and
  gave me many fine recipes. Chile Rellenos are often made with other
  stuffings than cheese. I have other recipes where they are stuffed
  with meat, sardines, rice, and a combination of meat and vegetables.
  Martha often made this same recipe using bell peppers. Actually, any
  pepper and almost any stuffing can be used, according to your
  personal tastes. Whatever cheese or other stuffing you choose, they
  are delicious! -----Barb

      2 tb Dry yeast;heaping
    1/2 c  High gluten flour
    500    MG Vitamin C
      5 c  Warm water (120-130*)
      1 c  Plain yogurt

    1/2 c  Honey
 
  1 1\2 tb Salt
  
  In mixer bowl equipped with kneading arm put ingredients in in this
  order: water, yeast, honey, oil, yogurt, 9 cups ww flour, high gluten
  flour, vitamin C and salt. Pulse a few times to mix. Turn mixer on,
  and quickly add remaining flour, one cup at a time, until dough forms
  a ball and cleans the side of the bowl. The amount of flour may vary.
  Knead 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 200 during this time. Lightly oil
  hands. Divide dough into equal portions. Shape into loaves and place
  in greased (I also flour) bread pans. Turn off oven. Place bread in
  oven, arranging pans with space between to allow heat to circulate
  freely. Set a kitchen timer and watch closely. Let rise until almost
  double in bulk, approx. 15-30 minutes. Leave bread in oven and turn
  heat to 350, baking 30-35 minutes. Immediately remove from pans; let
  cook on wire racks. This is adapted from Set For Life. This is how I
  make it and the bread is moist, scrumptous.

  1.  Soak the beans overnight in water to cover generously. Drain and
  rinse briefly.
  
  2.  Heat the oil in a large, heavy bottom pot over medium high heat.
  When hot, brown the turkey breast well on all sides. Remove and set
  aside.
  
  3.  Add the onions, garlic, celery, and green pepper. Saute, stirring
  frequently, until the vegetables are soft, 5-7 minutes.
  
  4.  Add the beans, tomatoes, water, chili powder, cayenne, and the
  turkey breast.  Heat until the pot starts bubbling, then reduce heat
  to a slow simmer, partially cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hour. Stir
  occasionally, watching carefully that the bottom does not start to
  stick.
  
  5.  Remove the turkey breast, remove the bone, and coarsely shred the
  meat with two forks (hold the meat with one fork, tear with the grain
  with the other.) Return the meat to the pot.
  
  6.  Heat a heavy bottom skillet over low heat.  Add the whole cumin
  seed and toast 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until
  lightly brown and aromatic. Remove from heat. Coarsely crush the
  cumin in a mortar and pestle or with a rolling pin.  Add to the pot.

 Categories: China, Soups/stews
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
   A simple and good egg drop soup is simply some very rich chicken
  soup..
  
   Some cornstarch to slightly thicken, like maybe a tsp, dissolved in a
  little stock, added to for each bowl of soup, bring to a simmer, add
  the cornstarch mixture when soup simmers. Add a little soy, very
  little to taste. While soup is on low boil, beat an egg or two,
  slowly dibble into the soup and stir quickly. Season to taste.
  
   To make 'Egg Flower' soup, do the same, but when adding the eggs,
  pour heavier down a fork right into the 'boiling' soup. Don't stir
  until egg coagulates.
   The egg will 'flower' up and look nice...

 Categories: Breads, Main dish, Italian, Cyberealm, Kooknet
      Yield: 2 Pies
 
  4 1/4 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Water, lukewarm (105 to 115
           Degrees Fahrenheit)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      2 tb Olive oil
 
  Put flour into a large bowl and make a deep well in the middle. Pour
  warm water into the well, mix in the yeast, using a bit of flour in
  the mix. Add the sugar, salt, and flour to the well, let stand for 10
  minutes until mixture bubbles. Slowly stir all of the flour into the
  yeast mixture. When it gets too thick to handle place it on a board
  and knead it until elastic. Form a ball, place into a greased bowl,
  then turn it over so the top of the ball is greased. Cover with a
  towel and let rise in a warm and draft free place for an hour or
  until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Punch down dough
  and divide in half. Refrigerate one half for later. (Allow extra time
  to rise). Roll the other half into a circle about 15 inches across.
  Place on a 14 inch greased pizza pan, roll edges to form a rim.
  
  Spread half the sauce on the pizza pie (see recipe), top with shredded
  mozzarella, and other favorite toppings (mushrooms, olives, pepperoni,
  etc). Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until edges are brown and cheese is
  bubbly. Cut each pie into 6 wedges.

    1/2 lb Cabbage, 2-3 cups shredded
    1/4 md Onion, chopped

           DRESSING
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar

    1/4 ts Mustard, dry or prepared
    1/4 ts Celery seed

      1 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Almost like relish or pickle.  Nice as a smaller serving with a rice
  salad. Keeps "several weeks" in a jar in the refrigerator. This is
  1/4 original recipe which I made for the second time. Have not kept
  it longer than a few days myself.
  
  Combine cabbage, onion and pimento in a large bowl. Combine dressing
  ingredients except oil in a small saucepan (or glass measure for
  microwave).  Bring to a boil, stir, add oil and boil again.
  
  Pour dressing over cabbage and toss.  Cover and refrigerate at least
  24 hours to blend flavours, stirring occasionally.

 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      6    Manicotti noodles, *cooked,
           Rinsed & drained*
    1/2 pk Frozen chopped spinach,
           *thawed and squeezed
           Dry(er)*
    1/2 c  White mushrooms
    1/2 c  Shitake mushrooms
    1/2 c  Onion
    1/2 c  Pepper, *sauteed in red
           Wine, open a nice bottle &
           Drink the rest*
      1 c  Fatfree cottage cheese (or
           That dryer kind of cottage
           Cheese)
      4    Cloves garlic sauteed w/ the
           Rest of the stuff
           I forgot!
           Italian herbs to taste
    1/2 c  Fatfree Parmesan
 
  All measurings except the six noodles (which serves 2) are
  approximate. Really, I guess you can put in about anything you like.
  I left the mushrooms out of Ben's because he's weird that way.
  Anyway, stuff this mixture into the shells. You may have some left
  over. So sue me. Put them in a baking dish and pour one jar of
  Healthy Choice f/f spaghetti sauce over the noodles. Bake at 400 F
  for about 45 minutes. This is very easy and I hope you like it as
  well as we do. Mangia!

      Title: MARY LITCHFIELD GRIMWOOD'S 1890 ENGLISH PLUM
 Categories: Christmas, Desserts, Fruits, Harned 1994, Nuts
      Yield: 6 Puddings
 
  4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour*; sifted
      4 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Cloves
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
      1    Box muscat raisins; seeded
      1    Box seedless nectar raisins
           -- (golden raisins)
           -or-
      1    Box sultanas
      1    Box currants
      2 c  Finely chopped apples
  1 1/2 c  Chopped black walnuts and
           -pecans; mixed
      1 lb Good beef suet
           -- ground by butcher
      2 c  Light brown sugar
      6    Eggs; well beaten
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
      1 c  Soft fresh bread crumbs
           -- from homemade-type bread
 
  *Plus additional flour for dusting fruits and adding to batter if
  needed.
  
  Grease and flour six 1-pound coffee cans or pudding molds.
  
  Sift the 4 1/2 cups flour with next 7 dry ingredients into a large
  bowl. In a separate bowl, dust the raisins, currants, apples and nuts
  with 2 tablespoons additional flour.
  
  Mix together the suet, brown sugar, eggs and buttermilk. Add the suet
  mixture gradually to the sifted dry ingredients, mixing well. Add
  fruits and bread crumbs; mix until well-blended. (If batter is not
  stiff, stir in additional flour as needed.)
  
  Divide mixture among prepared cans or molds, filling them half full.
  Cover each with a double sheet of waxed paper and tie down securely.
  
  Pressure cooker: Place hot water in the bottom of a large pressure
  cooker/canner, using enough to reach a level just below the bottom of
  a steaming rack.  Place cans or molds on the rack. Cover the pressure
  canner and steam the puddings 20 minutes with the vent tube (or
  petcock) open. Then attach the automatic pressure control or close
  the petcock and cook for 50 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure. Remove the
  pressure cooker from heat. When pressure is completely reduced, open
  and remove the puddings from the cooker.
  
  Regular steamer: In a large stockpot or boiling water bath canner, add
  water to come up just below the bottom of the steaming rack. Add
  puddings, cover and steam for 6 hours, adding water as necessary to
  keep from boiling dry.  It helps if the lid is tightfitting; if not,
  try putting a weight on the lid to keep it down, or cover the pot rim
  with a strip of aluminum foil to help the lid fit more tightly.
  
  To serve, slice and resteam in the top of a double boiler over
  simmering water until hot, about 1 hour. Serve with hard sauce and
  whipped cream flavored with brandy or the Wilson family's favorite
  sauce (see recipe).
  
  This pudding will keep for months in the refrigerator or may be
  frozen up to one year.

      Title: MARY ROGERS'S SOURDOUGH BISCUITS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Active Starter
      1 c  Milk
  2 1/2 c  Flour
    1/3 c  Lard or Shortening
      1 tb Sugar
    3/4 ts Salt
      2 ts Baking Powder
    1/2 ts Baking Soda
    1/4 ts Cream Of Tartar
 
  At bedtime make a batter of the half cup of starter, cup of milk, and
  1 cup of the flour.  Let set overnight if the biscuits are wanted for
  breakfast. If wanted for noon, the batter maybe mixed in the morning
  and set in a warm place to rise.  However, unless the weather is real
  warm, it is always all right to let it ferment overnight. It will get
  very light and bubbly. When ready to mix the biscuits, sift together
  the remaining cup and a half of flour and all other dry ingredients
  except the baking soda. Work in the lard or shortening with your
  fingers or a fork. Add baking soda dissolved in a little warm water
  to the sponge and then add the flour mixture. Mix into a soft dough.
  Knead lightly a few times to get in shape. Roll out to about 1/2 inch
  thickness or a little thicker,and cut with a biscuit cutter. Place
  close together in a 9 x 13-inch pan, turning to grease tops. Cover
  and set in a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes. Bake in a 375
  degree oven for about 30 to 35 minutes. Leftovers are good split and
  toasted in a sandwich toaster.

      Title: MARYETTA'S ITALIAN SAUSAGE BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Clay pot
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      1 lb Italian sausage, sweet
  1 1/4 c  Water; lukewarm
      1 ts Salt
      1 pk Dry active yeast
      1 pn Saffron
      1 tb Fennel seeds
      4 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
      5 ts Olive oil
           Cornmeal
 
  If you think your sausage has too much fat, simmer in shallow water
  in a frying pan, pricking the sausage with a sharp knife to allow the
  fat to escape.
  
  Combine the lukewarm water, salt, yeast, saffron, and fennel seeds in
  a metal cup and maintain a lukewarm temperature to keep the yeast
  active. Sift the flour into a large bowl, and make a well in the
  center of it. Pour in the yeast mixture and mix well (you will have
  to use your hands). Knead the dough until smooth and elastic (about
  10 minutes), then pour the oil over the dough and knead until no
  longer sticky (about 5 minutes). Place in a large bowl, cover with a
  towel, and put in a warm place until it doubles in size. (Press the
  dough with your fingertips; if they leave a stubborn imprint, it has
  risen enough.)
  
  When the rising time is almost over, presoak a clay pot, top and
  bottom, for 15 minutes.
  
  Roll the dough out to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Place the sausages
  (about 5) on top of the dough, wrap each in its own pocket, and pinch
  the ends closed. Place each pocket side by side to form one loaf.
  Trim a piece of aluminum foil, cover the bottom of the bottom of the
  presoaked pot and sprinkle with cornmeal. Add the dough to the pot
  and put lid on, then put the covered pot in a warm place and let the
  dough rise until doubled in size (about 60 minutes).
  
  Cover the pot and place it in a cold oven.
  
  Set the oven temperature at 450 degrees F.
  
  Bake for 45 minutes, then check the bread and let it continue baking,
  uncovered, in the oven to brown for an additional 15 minutes (total
  cooking time about 60 minutes). The bread will be done when a finger
  thump on the loaf's surface sounds hollow.
  
  Allow the bread to sit for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
  
  NOTE: This recipe can be safely doubled, but use 2 pots for cooking.

  Put everything but the crabmeat into a large pot and bring to a boil.
  Cover and simmer, adding crabmeat, for about 2 hours. Don't buy the
  lump crabmeat, it's a waste. I used leftover crabmeat and clawmeat,
  which gives it a bit more sweetness. If you're buying crabmeat, it's
  probably best to by 1/2 lb each of claw and backfin.

      Title: MARYLAND'S CHESS & APPLE TART
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
           Pastry for 10" pie
      1 c  Butter, cut into pieces
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      4 lg Eggs
        pn Salt
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract or
           -cognac vanilla *
    1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
  3 1/2 c  Peeled, cored, and chopped
           -tart apples (about 3)
 
  * To make cognac vanilla, get a fresh, fresh vanilla bean, cut
  lengthwise and then crosswise exposing the tiny tiny seeds. Put into
  an airtight container and pour on 2.5 oz. cognac or brandy per bean.
  Every 2 or 3 days, shake the bottle. After about 2 or 3 weeks, you'll
  have a new taste sensation in vanilla flavoring.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 F
  
  Roll out the pastry and line the pie pan.  Trim the edge even with
  the rum. Cover with buttered foil, and weigh it down with pastry
  weights or dried beans.  Put the shell on the bottom rack of the oven
  and bake for
       10    minutes.
  
  Remove the foil/weights and set the crust aside to cool. Reduce the
  oven temp to 325 F.
  
  Cream the butter and sugar thoroughly with an electric mixer until
  fluffy. Add the eggs, salt, vanilla, and nutmeg, and mix well. Fold
  the chopped apples into the egg mixture b hand. Pour the mixture into
  the cooled pie shell.  Place the pie pan on the lower rack of the
  oven, and bake until the apples are tender and the blade of a knife
  inserted into the custard comes out clean,  45 to 60 minutes.  Serve
  warm or cold.
  
  Watch the pie carefully.  Don't overcook it or the filling will
  "whey" or separate just as in cooking any custard. I think it's a
  good idea to undercook by a few minutes and let the cooking finish
  outside the oven. The pie will hold enough heat to finish cooking
  once removed from the oven.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8 oz Almond paste
  2 1/4 c  Confectioner's sugar
      1 ea Egg white; beaten lightly
 
  * Blend the almond paste and sugar together. Add enough egg white to

  shape. Dissolve cocoa in a little water and, with a small paint
  brush, streak the fruit with brown lines.
  
  APPLE Color the marzipan light green or green yellow. Shape into apple
  shape and make an impression on top with a chopstick. Finish the
  apple with a brown stem and a green leaf (made of marzipan)
  
  STRAWBERRY Color the marzipan red and shape it into a strawberry.
  Roll the berry in granulated sugar. Make the hull with green marzipan.
  
  ORANGE Make a smooth ball of orange-colored marzipan; then press a
  piece of paper towel against the sides to create the texture of
  orange skin. Push a whole clove into the stem end of the orange.
  
       This recpie makes one full-sized fruit or eight miniatures. Using
  chopsticks or toothpicks help the modeling process. Paste food

 Categories: Breads, Mexican
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  3 3/4 c  Unbleached A-P flour
  1 1/2 c  Masa harina de maiz
      2 tb Plus 1 ts baking powder
      1 ts Salt
      4 oz Unsalted butter, well-chill
           -cut into small pieces
    1/2 c  Solid vegetable shortening,
           -well-chilled, cut into
           -small pieces
      2 c  Cultured buttermilk,chilled
 
  Position racks in the upper and middle thirds of the oven and preheat
  the oven to 450F.
  
  In a large bowl, stir together 3 1/2 cups of the flour, the masa,
  baking powder, and salt.  With a pastry cutter, blend in the butter
  and shortening until the mixture resembles a coarse and slightly
  lumpy meal. Stir in the buttermilk until a soft, crumbly dough is
  formed. Sprinkle the work surface with half of the remaining flour.
  Turn the dough out, gather it into a ball, and briefly knead it, just
  until it holds together. Flatten the dough, sprinkle it with the rest
  of the flour, and roll it out about 1-inch thick.  With a round
  3-inch cutter, form the biscuits, transferrring them to 2 ungreased
  baking sheets and spacing them about 2 inches apart. Gather the
  scraps into a ball, roll it out to 1-inch thick, and cut out the
  remaining biscuits.
  
  Set the baking sheets on the racks and bake about 15 minutes,
  exchanging the position of the sheets on the racks from top to bottom
  and from front to back at the halfway point, or until the biscuits
  are golden and crisp. Serve hot or warm.
  
  Note: masa is NOT the same thing as cornmeal.  Stores catering to
  Hispanic population will have masa.  Since masa contains no gluten,
  these biscuits are especially tender.

      Title: MASA BISCUITS WITH HAM & GREEN CHILE GRAVY
 Categories: Ham, Sauces, Mexican
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      5    Long green chiles (Anaheims)
      6 tb Unsalted butter
      1 lb Firm, smoky ham, trimmed,
           -cut into 1/4" cubes
    1/4 c  Unbleached A-P flour
      5 c  Milk, 2% ok
    1/2 ts Salt
      8    Freshly baked Masa Biscuits,
           -(recipe), split
 
  In the open flame of a gas burner or under a pre-heated broiler,
  roast the long green chiles, turning them, until they are lightly but
  evenly charred. Steam the chiles in a paper bag, or in a bowl,
  covered with a plate, until cool.  Rub away the burned peel. Stem and
  seed the chiles and coarsely chop them.  There should be about 3/4
  cup.
  
  In a large skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the ham
  cubes and cook them, stirring constantly, until lightly browned,
  about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the ham cubes and cook,
  stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.  Slowly whisk the milk into the
  ham mixture. Stir in the green chiles and salt. Raise the heat to
  medium and bring the milk mixture to a simmer. Cook, stirring
  occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pan, until thickened into
  a medium gravy, about 7 minutes. Adjust the seasoning.
  
  Arrange the biscuits, split-sides up, on 8 plates. Spoon the gravy
  over and around the, using it all. Serve immediately.
  
  NOTE:  I tend to add a bit more "heat" by adding some fresh jalepeno,
  cut into very fine julienne as garnish to each person's serving.
  Looks pretty, too.  This is also a good dish to make using smoked
  turkey (thigh) instead of ham.

    1/2 c  Eggplant, diced (optional)
      3 lg Fresh basil leaves (or 1/2
        ts Dried)
      1 pn (1/4 teaspoon) thyme
    1/2 ts Salt (or 2 tablespoons
           Bragg's Liquid Amino)
    1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
        x  Chili peppers or hot sauce
           To taste (opt)
 
  This is the good part. Saute onions and garlic in water till starting
  to turn yellow, add all other ingredients in a large pot with 2 1/2
  cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, simmer an hour (or
  until peas are tender) and then puree in a blender. That's it!
  
  Serve as a main meal with whole wheat pita bread. For a variation,
  sprinkle fresh ripe diced tomato on top of soup (or this can be
  blended in earlier). For those who remember the days when pea soup
  used to have h*m or b*c*n in it, soy baco-bits, sprinkled in just
  before serving, brings back that aura.

           Bragg's Liquid Amino)
    1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
        x  Chili peppers or hot sauce
           To taste (opt)
 
  This is the good part. Saute onions and garlic in water till starting
  to turn yellow, add all other ingredients in a large pot with 2 1/2
  cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, simmer an hour (or
  until peas are tender) and then puree in a blender. That's it!
  
  Serve as a main meal with whole wheat pita bread. For a variation,
  sprinkle fresh ripe diced tomato on top of soup (or this can be
  blended in earlier). For those who remember the days when pea soup
  used to have h*m or b*c*n in it, soy baco-bits, sprinkled in just
  before serving, brings back that aura.

      Title: MASA SOVADA (PORTUGUESE SWEETBREAD)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Water (warm for dry;
           -lukewarm for compressed)
      1 c  Scalded milk
      1 c  Sugar
      2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
    1/2 ts Of salt
  5 1/2    To 6 cups all-purpose flour
      4    Eggs
           2 packages yeast (active
           -dry or compressed)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Scald milk and add to sugar, butter and
  salt; stir until butter is melted. Mix cinnamon and flour. Add 1/2 the
  flour to the milk/sugar/butter/salt, and mix until smooth. Beat 3
  eggs and add them and the yeast to the mixture.
  
  Continue to add remaining flour to make soft dough. Remove it from
  the bowl and place on floured board. Knead until smooth and satiny
  (about 15 mins.). Shape into a ball and place in buttered bowl. Cover
  and let rise until double in size (2-1/2 to 3 hours).
  
  Punch risen dough down and divide it in half.  Place in two greased
  pans (8 inches round).  Let rise in warm place until double in size
  (1-1/2 to 2 hours). Brush tops of dough with remaining egg (beaten).
  
  Bake in 350 degree oven for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool
  on wire racks.
  
  NOTES:  I have found that if I initially heat up the oven and then
  turn it off, I put the dough in there to rise and it rises twice as
  fast.
  
  Also, I don't know if this violates any rules, but I've found that I
  prefer this bread with raisins added.
  
  Finally, as I mentioned to those who have gotten this recipe already,
  this bread makes the best toast in the world! (Personal opinion, of
  course..)

      Yield: 1 /4 cup
 
      2 tb Black cumin seeds
      2 tb Mustard seeds
      2 tb Fenugreek seeds
      2    Whole cloves
    1/2 ts Mixed spice,
           Pumpkin spice or cinnamon
 
  Toast cumin, mustard, and fenugreek seeds separately by placing a thin
  layer of each spice in a small dry frying pan over medium high heat,
  stirring so that it is even, until they darken, about 3 to 4 minutes.
  
  Grind seeds to a powder in grinder or with mortar and pestle, grinding
  cloves with the seeds.  Stir in spice or cinnamon. Store in airtight
  container; keeps indefinitely. Can be added to curries, chutneys, and
  a myriad of other recipes.  Source:  "The Complete Caribbean

  Masala is a blend of spices and herbs used primarily in Indian,
  caribbean, malaysian cooking.  In the US, we can get curry powder,
  which is just another form of masala (I've learned this in the 3
  years I've been here in South Africa).  You can mix your own or
  purchase from a spice shop that carries Indian or Malay spices.  I
  rarely use prepackaged curry powder, but it will work in the recipe.

      1 tb White wine vinegar
           -=OR=- Lemon juice
 
  Makes About 1 Pound
  
  CHOOSE A STAINLESS STEEL BOWL that fits inside a large saucepan
  without touching the bottom of the pan. Add water to the pan and
  place the bowl in the pan so that the bowl touches the surface of the
  water but still sits firmly on the rim of the pan. Remove the bowl,
  place the pan on medium heat, and bring the water to a boil. Place
  the cream in the bowl and place over the boiling water. Adjust the
  heat under the pan to medium and heat the cream, checking the
  temperature often with an instant-read thermometer, to 190F; stir
  occasionally. Stir in the vinegar, continuing to stir gently until
  the cream begins to curdle. Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and
  allow the curds to firm up for 10 minutes. Line a strainer or
  colander with dampened cheesecloth, napkin, or coffee filters. Set
  the strainer or colander over a bowl and carefully spoon the curds
  into the strainer. Allow the mascarpone to cool to room temperature,
  cover the strainer tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 24
  hours to allow the cheese to finish draining and become firm. Store
  in the refrigerator in a tightly covered container. Use the
  mascarpone within 3-or-4 days.

 Categories: Cheese, Desserts, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
       12 oz frozen mixed berries,
  :          thawed and drained
        3 tb sugar
  :          vegetable cooking spray
        1 tb milk
    1 1/4 ts unflavored gelatin
    1 1/4 c  whipping cream
  :     1/3 c  milk
  :       1 tb vanilla
  :     1/4 c  sugar
  :     1/4 c  mascarpone cheese
  :     1/4 c  sour cream Chilling time:3-12 hours
  
  Comments Panna cotta is an Italian dessert that literally means
  "cooked cream", which is usually what the traditional recipe consists
  of. I took some creative liberties and added mascarpone and sour
  cream.
  
  Directions Place mixed berries in a small bowl and crush slightly
  with the back of spoon. Stir in 3 tablespoons sugar. Cover with
  plastic wrap and set aside. Spray four 3/4 cup ramekins with cooking
  spray. In a small bowl, pour 1 tablespoon milk. Sprinkle gelatin over
  and allow it to soften (10 minutes). Meanwhile, combine cream, 1/3
  cup milk, vanilla, and 1/4 cup sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil
  over medium high heat, stirring often. Remove from heat, add gelatin
  mixture and stir until melted. Let the mixture cool. In a medium
  sized bowl, whisk together mascarpone cheese and sour cream until
  smooth. Slowly add the hot cream mixture into the bowl, whisking
  constantly. Pour mixture into prepared ramekins. Chill until cold and
  set (at least 3 hours and up to 12) Run a small knife around the edge
  of the ramekins to loosen the panna cotta. If that doesn't work, dip
  the bottom of the ramekin in hot water for a few seconds. Invert
  ramekin onto a plate. Spoon berry sauce over panna cotta. Serve. Walt

      Title: MASFOUF DE TUNIS (TUNISIAN SWEET SNACK)
 Categories: Desserts, Tunisian, Holiday
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Semolina
      1 c  Water; hot
      8 tb Butter; melted
      4 tb Raisins
      4 tb Blanched almonds;halve/toast
      3 tb Pine nuts
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 lb Seedless grapes
 
  Masfouf is a desert snack traditionally served after the fast is
  broken on Ramadhan evenings. It is, in fact, remarkably like the
  various soojee (cream of wheat semolina) preparations encountered in
  Kashmir and other parts of India. The techniques of assembling are
  different, but the idea and ingredients are the same.
  
  1. Mix the semolina and hot water in a bowl. Put it into the top
  (kesskess) of a couscousier or a Chinese-style steamer and steam,
  covered, over hot water for 10 minutes.
  
  2. Remove the semolina to a bowl and stir in 4 tablespoons of the
  butter. Mix and toss to separate the grains. Return the semolina to
  the steamer and steam, covered, for 20 minutes. The semolina will
  expand and will be cooked through.
  
  3. Soak the raisins in hot water for 5 minutes and drain. Remove the
  semolina the second time, stir in the balance of the butter, 4
  tablespoons, and turn the semolina out on a serving dish. Add the
  raisins, almonds, pine nuts and mix and toss together. Set aside a
  few raisins and nuts to decorate the top of the Masfouf. Sprinkle the
  Masfouf with the sugar and decorate with the raisins and nuts.
  
  Serve at room temperature. Serves 6 or more.

  The recipe is from a cookbook I have on Amish and Mennonite cooking.
  It calls for a pinch of saffron but because of the astronomic cost of
  this spice I have always omitted it when making this recipe. Hope
  it's similar to what you're looking for! 1.  Melt butter. Add celery
  and onion. Cook until tender.  Pour over bread cubes and mix well.
  2.Combine saffron(if using) and boiling water. Add to bread and mix
  well. Add remaining ingredients to bread, mixing well after each
  addition. Finished product should be very moist.  Add more milk if
  necessary. 3. Turn into 2 well greased casserole dishes. Bake at 350
  for 45 minutes. Note: I use one 9x13 pan instead of two smaller
  casseroles.

      Title: MASHED POTATO GRATIN WITH GARLIC & ONIONS
 Categories: Potato, Garlic, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lg Idaho potatoes
      2 lg Garlic heads, roasted
      2 lg Onions, baked
  1 1/4 c  Heavy cream
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 c  Gruyere
 
  Remove the papery covering of the garlic heads, but do not peel and
  do not separate the cloves.  Wrap well in foil and put them in the
  oven. Put the onions on a double sheet of foil, but do not wrap them;
  put them in the oven. Pierce the potatoes in several places with a
  thin skewer or the tines of a fork.  Put them directly on the oven
  rack. Bake the garlic for one hour and the onions and the potatoes
  for an hour and a half at 425. After an hour pull out the garlic
  heads, unwrap, and let cool for 5 minutes. Separate the cloves and
  squeeze them over a bowl so the softened garlic pops out into the
  bowl. After 1 1/4  hours, pull out the onions and potatoes.  If the
  onions are not very soft (almost collapsed) put them back in for a
  few minutes. Perforate the potatoes lengthwise and crosswise with the
  tines of a fork and squeeze.  Scoop the potato flesh into a bowl and
  mash it with a potato masher. With a sharp knife, cut off the stem
  and root ends of the onions.  Remove the skin and the first layer.
  Put the onions in a food processor and puree. Combine the potatoes,
  garlic, onion, 1/4 cup of cream, and salt and pepper in the bowl of a
  mixer. Beat (with the paddle blade) until smooth and blended, then
  scrape the mixture into a large gratin bowl.  Sprinkle the top with
  cheese. (The recipe can be made ahead to this point and kept in the
  refrigerator, covered, for a day or so. Bring to room temperature
  before proceeding.) Reduce the oven temperature to 350. Pour the
  remaining cream over the mixture. Bake, uncovered, for 40 - 50
  minutes, or until the top is browned and bubbly and the cream has
  cooked down to a very thick suace-like consistency. Try to arrange to
  have some leftovers; this is very good when it is cold.

  and replenish the balance with same recipe first used. A sprinkle of
  dry yeast may be needed if starter doesn't appear bubbly and ferented

           Typed by Manny Rothstein
 
     A simple blending of celery root, potatoes and parsnip makes these
  mashed root vegetables as smooth as silk without much fat. The russet
  potatoes have just the right starchy texture to thicken the mixture.
  Celery root browns quickly once its surface is exposed to the air, so
  have the salted water boiling, ready for the peeled celery root and
  potatoes.
  
     Plunge celery roots, potatoes and parsnip into pot of boiling
  water. Cook 10 minutes. Add garlic cloves. Cook until vegetables are
  tender, about 10 min. more. Drain vegetables.
     Put hot drained vegetables, butter, salt, nutmeg and pepper into
  processor fitted with metal blade. Puree mixture until very smooth,
  stopping to scrape down sides of bowl, about 1 to 2 minutes. Adjust
  seasonings to taste. Transfer to greased 5-cup capacity baking dish.
  Cover dish with foil. Can be made several hours ahead and kept at room
  temperature.
     To serve, bake at 300 deg. until hot or reheat in microwave oven.
  Spoon hot mixture onto 6 heated dinner plates, dividing evenly. Ladle
  hot venison ragout over, again dividing evenly. Serve immediately.

      Title: MASTER BAKE IT ALL MIX+++FGGT98B
 Categories: Master mix, Jewel, Basic
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  Vegetable shortening
      9 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 c  Double acting baking powder*
 
  NOTE:  This next group of recipes for the Master Mix collection is
  from a company called Jewel. I don't think that their product is
  available any longer, so I have substituted just the word shortening
  for the Jewel shortening. I have had excellant results using either
  Crisco or (lately) Mazola shortening in these recipes. Unfortunately,
  I think the Jewel shortening has gone to the shortening heaven with
  Spry and several others whose name eludes me now. Thank goodness the
  recipes have survived! *4 Tablespoons Combine sifted flour, salt and
  baking powder. Stir well. Sift into a large bowl or pan.  Add
  shortening. Use a pastry blender to distribute shortening throughout
  dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal and small
  peas. The Bake-It-All Mix is now ready to use or store in a canister
  on your cupboard shelf. A cool area is desirable. Yield: About 12

      Title: MASTER MIXES--INTRODUCTION
 Categories: Master, Mix, Intro
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------PLEASE READ ME FIRST-------------------------
 
     There was so much interest shown in the recipes I posted under the
  Do-Ahead Mixes over in the Food Forum that I have decided to also
  share with you all some Master Mixes. These will be primarily for
  baking, but some of them can also be used for breakfast foods and
  main dishes. Rather than post them under Desserts and/or Breads, I
  have decided to post all of them here, because this area is the Food
  Forum, and since they are for mixes, I did not want to confuse anyone
  and make them "bounce" from board to board searching for them. To the
  members who have the Meal-Master program: I would suggest you make a
  separate disk for these, as altogether there will be about 100
  recipes for the set, and I plan to add to these as I put them into my
  Meal-Master program. The INDEX will consist of the name of the Master
  Mix for each set, so that if there is more than one name of a recipe,
  you will be able to go to the correct mix for the recipe to use. Each
  category line will consist of the name of the Master Mix to use, such
  as Master Mix, Quick Bread Mix and Breakfast Mix. The next heading in
  the category line will be the type of recipe, such as main dish,
  pancakes, etc. The last part of the category will be the source, such
  as Hershey's or Southern Living. All of the Basic Mix recipes will
  have the word BASIC in the category line so that they can be located
  easily. For those of you not using Meal- Master, you will be able to
  file your recipes by using these same categories also. If you do, it
  might be easier to file each set separately, so that you do not get
  the Master Mixes mixed up. For this reason, I will be posting them in
  groups as much as possible. I think it is a good idea to also
  down-load the recipes as soon as possible to the posting, because
  lately some recipes seem to have a shorter life-span on *Prodigy than
  others, and if you are interested in these at all, you might want to
  make sure you get the complete sets. My GrandMa Rose always cautions
  me to take everything that is offered to me, and reminds me that what
  I cannot use, perhaps someone else may be needing. Or you yourself
  may need it at a later date. If anyone else has any recipes of other
  Master Mixes, please post and share them, whether or not they are in
  the Meal-Master format. Or if you do not care to post, leave a note
  as to the source of your collection, and if I have the books here, I
  will look them up and add them to this group as time permits. I
  intend to send these recipes out in small groups, at the rate of one
  group early each week, in collecting them all. DEE/Austin (aka

      Title: MASTER RECIPE FOR FISH STOCK
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 2 1/2 quarts
 
      3 lb Fish trimmings; rinsed
           -cut in 3" pieces
      1 md Onion; diced small
      2 md Carrots; diced small
      1 lg Celery stalk; diced small
      8    Parsley stems; chopped
      1 c  Dry white wine
    1/4    Lemon
     10    Black peppercorns
      2    Bay leaves
      1    Dried chili pepper
 
  Note: Fish heads, tails, and bones are all possibilities for trimming
  and can be used for the stock. An equal amount of shrimp and lobster
  or crab carcasses can be substituted for the fish bones.
  
  Put all ingredients in a 6-to-8-quart pot. Cover with 2 3/4 quarts
  cold water. Bring to a boil over medium heat; simmer slowly for about
  1 hour, periodically skimming away scum that rises to the surface.
  Strain stock through double thickness of cheesecloth, pressing out as
  much liquid as possible with the back of a spoon. Use to make fish
  soups, stews, etc. The stock can be cooled and refrigerated for up to
  3 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

      Title: MASTER RECIPE FOR POLENTA
 Categories: Grains, Italian
      Yield: 7 Servings
 
           Salt
      2 c  Coarse italian cornmeal
 
  *Use this recipe to make the basic polenta required for preparing the
  "Polenta `Lasagne' with Beef, Tomato, and Red Wine Sauce", "Soft
  Polenta with Porcini Mushroom Sauce", and "Polenta Crostini with Tuna
  Butter and Capers."  Many of these dishes require that you cook the
  polenta, cool it, and cut it into squares. However, the soft polenta
  prepared to serve with Porcini Mushroom sauce has a looser texture.
  If you find that the polenta made from this master recipe is too
  stiff for the soft polenta and mushroom dish, stir in 1/4 c boiling
  water to "loosen" it. TO COOK: Bring 7 c water to boil in a large
  saucepan. Add 1T salt. Stirring constantly with a long-handled wooden
  spoon, add cornmeal in a slow, constant steam o prevent lumps from
  forming.  Simmer, stirring consntly until polenta is very thick and
  creamy and pulls awarom the sides of the pan, 25 to 30 min. Proceed
  immediately a ructed in the individual recipes. MICROWAVE VERSION:
  (Just as good but er) Put 1 T salt, the cornmeal, c water in a 4 qt
  microwave-safe bowl.  Cover and chis mixture on high power, stirring
  every 6 min until cr 24 min in all. Proceed immediately as your are
  ucted in the individual recipe of your choice. Makes 7 cups. *
  Because polenta contanly cornmeal, salt, and water, the texture of
  the cornme important. Unless you have access to a specialty foop or
  want to use mail order, the exact texture of the cornme  you find
  taly is unavailable in the US.
    To find out how to best approximate Italian po, using cornmeal that
  is available here, COOK'S tried m it with fine-ground, coarse-ground,
  and an equal re of the two types (in all cases, Goya brand meal wad).

  from the pot and pressed under weights until the juices drain off. It
  is refrigerated until chilled, then served as a hors d'oeuvre, cut
  into thin slices.

      Title: MATAR PANEER (FRESH CHEESE)
 Categories: Indian, Cheese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      5 c  Homogenized milk
      3 tb Fresh lemon juice
      3 tb All purpose flour
           Cheesecloth
      2 tb Vegetable oil

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 md Onion, cut into chunks
      3 md Tomatoes
      1    Piece ginger, chopped ( 1
           -inch)
      2    Garlic clove
      1 sm Red or green chili
      2 tb Garam masala (a ground
           -spice)
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3 c  Fresh or frozen peas
 
  Paneer is a fresh cheese with plenty of texture and protein. In this
  traditional northern Indian dish, Paneer is combined with gree peas
  in a spicy tomato-ginger sauce. Fresh Paneer is quite crumbly, so it
  is generally cut into cubes and sauteed until golden before combining
  with other ingredients. For variety, try adding some finely minced
  fresh cilantro and a little freshly ground black pepper to the
  mixture before cubing and frying.  If you do have any left over,
  serve it warm in whole wheat pita bread topped with sliced tomaotes
  and crunchy red onions.
  
  PANEER:
  
  FOR PANEER: Bring milk to a boil. As soon as it begins to bubble,
  stir in lemon juice; remove from heat. Allow to rest 15 minutes; the
  curds will separate from the whey. Strain curds through a triple
  layer of cheesecloth; squeeze out as much whey as you easily can.
  Discard whey. Knead flour into curds, place on a plate; pat to 3/4
  inch thickness. Refrigerate while preparing sauce. For sauce, place
  all ingredients except peas in a blender or food processor; blend to
  a smooth paste. Pour into a large skillet, bring to a boil; simmer,
  uncovered, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, remove Paneer from
  refrigerator, cut into 1 inch cubes. Heat the 2 tbsp oil in a
  on-stick skillet, saute cubes until golden on both sides. Add paneer
  cubes and peas to sauce. Simmer for ten minutes or until peas are
  cookes. Serve with steamed rice. Makes 4-5 servings.

      Title: MATAR PANEER (PEAS WITH PANEER)
 Categories: Indian, Vegetarian, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      1 md Onion; peeled and chopped
      1    1-inch cube fresh ginger
           -- peeled and chopped
      6 tb Vegetable oil
           Paneer (see recipe); plus...
      2 c  Whey (from paneer)
           -OR-
      8 oz -Tofu, and water
      1    Whole dried hot red pepper
      1 tb Ground coriander seeds
    1/4 ts Ground turmeric
      3 md Tomatoes; peeled & minced
      1 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
  1 1/2 c  Shelled fresh peas; -OR-
     10 oz -defrosted frozen peas
 
  This Punjabi dish, with some variation in spices, is eaten over all of
  northern India.  Paneer is a fresh milk cheese with an interesting,
  slightly chewy consistency. It's easy to make, but requires planning
  ahead. You can substitute a diced 6- or 8-ounce cake of pressed tofu
  for it in this recipe.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Put the chopped onion and ginger into the
  container of an electric blender or food processor along with 1/3 cup
  water and blend until you have a smooth paste. Leave paste in the
  blender container.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy, 10-inch-wide pot (preferably teflon-lined)
  over a medium flame.  When hot, put in the pieces of paneer (or tofu)
  in a single layer and fry them until they are golden brown on all
  sides. This happens pretty fast.  With a slotted spoon, remove fried
  paneer to a plate. Put the dried red pepper into the same oil. Within
  2 seconds, turn the pepper over so that it browns on both sides. Now
  put in the contents of the blender (keep your face averted as the
  paste might splatter). Fry, stirring constantly, for 10-12 minutes,
  or until paste turns light brown. Add the coriander and turmeric and
  fry, stirring, for another minute. Put in the minced tomatoes. Stir
  and fry for another 3 to 4 minutes or until tomatoes turn a dark
  reddish brown. Now pour in 2 cups of the whey (or water if you're
  using tofu). Add the salt and the black pepper. Mix well and bring to
  a boil.  Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Lift
  cover and put in the paneer pieces and the peas. Cover and simmer for
  10 minutes or until peas are cooked.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Text recipe
 
  Paneer is soft white 'farmer' cheese that is commonly used in India. I
  substituted reduced-fat White Wave tofu, and it takes the place of
  paneer very well. This takes about 1/2 hour to make.
  
  start some rice
  
  cut 1 brick tofu into cubes and bake in 300 degree oven while you
  prepare sauce.
  
  1 onion (slice very thinly and saute in your favorite medium until
  browned) 1 t. pressed garlic (in with the onion)
  
  1 c. water 1 t. ginger 1 T. cumin 1 T. coriander 1/2 t. clove 1/4 t.
  methi (fenugreek) 1 t. salt
  
  add spices to onion/garlic at last minute of saute. Stir until
  distributed and then add water.
  
  mix: 2 t. gram flour (chickpea flour, besan) enough water to make a
  thin, smooth paste
  
  add a family size package of frozen green peas to the sauce, and cook
  until hot.
  
  dribble in the chickpea flour mixture, while stirring. The sauce will
  thicken.
  
  add: 1 cup of ground tomatoes or tomato puree juice of one lemon
  
  stir, adjust seasonings.
  
  Add tofu and simmer until it absorbs some of the seasonings. Add more
  water if necessary.
  
  serve with rice

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour, all purpose

      1 c  Brown sugar; packed
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts -Salt
    3/4 c  Butter; softened

      2 c  Dates; chopped, pitted
    1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
      1 ts Lemon juice
    3/4 c  -Boiling water
 
  "This recipe in some old cookbooks is called Date Sandwich Cake. Other
  variations are Raisin Squares or Fig Squares. .. Date Squares
  (Matrimonial Cake, if you happen to come from the West) are a real
  nostalgia treat. The fillings in the 30s recipes was extremely sweet.
  Today's versions reduce the sugar in the filling, since the dates are
  sweet enough, and are often microwaved. Raisin Puff, an old favorite
  in P.E.I. is somewhat similar, with raisin filling sandwiched between
  layers of soft cookie dough instead of an oatmeal mixture."
  
  Filling: In saucepan, cook dates, sugar, lemon juice and water over
  medium heat, stirring often, until the dates are soft, about 15
  minutes. Let cool.
    In a bowl, combine flour, rolled oats, sugar, baking soda and salt;
  blend in butter until mixture is crumbly. Pat half onto bottom of 9
  inch square pan. Spread filling evenly over the top. Sprinkle with
  the remaining flour mixture, patting lightly. Bake in a 350F oven for
  30 to 35 minutes or until nicely browned. Let cool; cut into squares.
  
  MAKES: 36 SQUARES VARIATION: Mincemeat Squares
  : Use 2 cups mincemeat instead of date filling.

  strainer. Pour boiling water over them and drain quickly (they should
  be slightly limp, not soggy). Mix together matzot, eggs and seasoning
  in a bowl. (You can add cottage cheese at this point.)
  
  Heat the margarine or oil in a frying pan, and pour in the mixture.
  You can either (a) heat one side until brown, then flip over, like an
  omelette or (b) heat while continually stirring, like scrambled eggs
  (my tradition). Serve hot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional Passover breakfast -- When I was growing up, the main
  thing that kept us kids happy about matzah-for-eight-days was my
  father making "matzah 'n' eggs" for breakfast nearly every morning. I
  didn't even know it had a "real" name. As I was beginning to stock my
  own kitchen, the very first Passover items I bought were a bowl, a
  colander and a frying pan. Yield: Serves 1-2.
  
  *  Any printed recipe for matzo brei that I've ever seen says "serve
  with honey or jam."  However, in our family, this dish is considered
  a savoury, not a sweet, and we're much likelier to sprinkle a bit
  more salt and pepper on top.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes.
  : Precision:  is to laugh.

      Title: MATZO KUGEL
 Categories: Try it
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
 
        8    Matzos ~*
        8    Eggs ~**
        1 tb Salt (more or less to suit)
        1 ds Pepper (to taste)
        1 c  Sugar - some folks use less
        1 ts Cinnamon
      1/2    Lemon; juice and zest
        9 oz Jelly
        1 ea Crisco
        1 ea Sugar
        1 ea Cinnamon
  
  Fill a bowl with water and break matzos up into it, to soak. When you
  think they are moist enough (not very long), press out the water as
  much as possible without turning the matzos into mush.
  
  In a second bowl, beat eggs, salt and pepper well. Add sugar,
  cinnamon, lemon juice and zest, until mixed very well.
  
  Grease the bottom and sides of a 13" X 9" pan heavily with Crisco. Add
  matzo to the egg mixture.  Stir carefully to mix. Pour 1/2 of the egg
  mixture into the prepared pan. Then put the jelly over that layer.
  Pour the remaining egg mixture over the jelly.  Dot 1/2 ts of Crisco
  in about 12 places on top of the dish. Then sprinkle with a little
  cinnamon and sugar over all.
  
  Bake in a 375^ oven for one hour or until brown and crisp. It will
  probably take more than one hour. This makes about 12 servings.
  
  ~* and ~**.  If you chose to make a larger recipe, ALWAYS use the same
  number of eggs as Matzo, to keep the right consistency. Increase other
  ingredients proportionately.
  
  This recipe, though posted by a good gentile girl, has been tasted by
  us and enjoyed.  It comes to me by way of my best friend's mother,
  who makes this every year for Passover.

           -JUDI M. PHELPS
      5    Whole matzos
    1/2 c  Sweet red wine; kosher for
           -Passover
      2    Eggs; separated
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Matzo meal
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Strawberry preserves or

           -thinly sliced
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
  1 1/2 tb Honey
  1 1/2 tb Oil
 
  In a large deep dish, soak the whole matzos in the wine for 5 minutes,
  being careful not to break them. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks
  and sugar until light and lemon-colored. Stir in the matzo meal.
  
  In a clean small bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt until the egg
  whites are stiff but not dry.  Fold the egg whites into the egg yolk
  mixture.
  
  Combine the preserves and nuts in a small bowl.  Mix well. Arrange the
  sliced apples in a shallow dish; sprinkle with the cinnamon. Heat the
  honey and oil in a 8 x 8-inch baking pan over low heat. Stir until
  blended.

  of the egg mixture.  Place the second matzo over the filling and
  spread with half of the preserves mixture. Place the third matzo on
  top of this and arrange the sliced apples and cinnamon evenly over
  the matzo. Cover with the fourth matzo; spread with the remaining
  preserves mixture. Top with the fifth matzo.  Stir any leftover wine
  into the remaining egg mixture and spread over the top and sides of
  the strudel.
  
  Bake in a preheated 325-degree F. oven for 30 minutes or until golden
  brown.  Cut into portions while still warm, but leave in the pan to
  cool thoroughly.  Serve cold. Serves 8 to 10. Source: The Complete

 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Melted fat or oil
      2 lg Eggs, slightly beaten
    1/2 c  Matzo meal
      1 ts Salt (optional)
      2 tb Soup stock or water
 
  Blend fat, or oil, and eggs together.  Add matzo meal and salt
  mixture to egg and blend well.  Then add soup stock or water and mix
  until uniform. Cover mixing bowl and place in refrigerator for 15
  minutes. Using a two or three quart pot bring 1 1/2 quarts of
  slightly salted water (no salt if desired) to a brisk boil. Reduce
  flame, and into the slightly boiling water drop balls approximately 1
  inch in diameter formed from mixture from refrigerator. Cover pot and
  cook 30 to 40 minutes. Have soup at room temperature, or warmer, and
  remove matzo balls from water and place in soup pot. When ready to
  serve, allow soup to simmer for about 5 minutes. Makes about eight
  balls.
  
  Oh yes, the soup.  Any chicken or vegetable soup, Kosher Shel Pesach,
  will do fine.  I prefer the vegetable. My favorite Jewish cuisine
  book is "Jewish Cookery", by Leah H. Leonard. I'm sorry this is too
  late for your Pesach Seder.

  2 3/4 c  Flour
      4    Egg

      1 tb Butter
      6    Bacon slice; cut into cubes
      3    Onion, med; diced
    1/4 lb Sausage, Italian sweet
      1    Hard roll, without crust, an
    1/2 lb Spinach; cooked
    1/2 lb Ground meat
      1 c  Farmer's sausage; diced
      3    Egg
      3 tb Parsley, fresh; chopped
           Salt; to taste
           Pepper, black; to taste
           Nutmeg; grated
      1    Egg
      3 tb Milk, canned
           Stock, beef
 
  Combine the flour, eggs, and salt in a bowl and mix to make a pasta
  dough. Then add a little water and knead until it has a firm but
  elastic consistency.
  
  To make the filling, melt the butter in a skillet and fry the bacon
  with the onions until both are quite translucent. Combine the bacon
  mixture with the sausage meat.
  
  Moisten the hard roll in water, press dry, and put through the meat
  grinder (better than the food mill or food processor), along with the
  bacon mixture, cooked spinach, ground meat or smoked farm sausage,
  leftover roast, etc.  Then fold in the eggs, parsley, and seasonings;
  mix together. The filling should be very spicy indeed.
  
  On a board that has been sprinkled with flour, roll out the dough into
  rectangular sheets (about twice as wide as you want your
  'Maultaschen' to be).  Take a tablespoon measure and put little dabs
  of filling at equally spaced 3-inch intervals all down the middle of
  one side of the sheet of dough.  Mix together the egg and canned milk
  and apply it to the spaces in between, the outer edge and the fold
  line. Fold the plain half of the sheet of dough over to cover the
  filling, press down firmly on the spaces around the little packets of
  filling, and use a pastry wheel or knife to separate the packets into
  3-inch square or diamond- shaped 'Maultaschen'. The process is
  similar to making ravioli. Cook thoroughly in beef stock or boiling
  salted water for about 10 to 15 minutes, dpeending upon the size of
  the 'Maultaschen'.  They'll bob up to the surface when they're done;
  remove them with a slotted spoon and allow to drain.
  
  Serving suggestions:
  
  Cut an onion or two into half-rings, fry in butter until golden brown
  amd empty the contents of the skillet over the 'Maultaschen' on the
  serving dish. Serve with slippery potato salad or a mixed green
  salad. Certainly if anyone were to insist that 'Maultaschen' were the
  most delicious of all Swabian specialties, I[=Horst Scharfenberg]
  would hardly be prepared to deny it.  In fact, as indicated earlier,
  I suspect that 'Maultaschen' would have very good chances in a
  four-way interna- tional competition with ravioli, won tons, and
  pirogi for the champion- ship of the Roughly Rectangular Pasta with
  Meat (plus Miscellaneous) Filling division.
  
  It has been said that 'Maultaschen' were originally invented in order
  to allow Swabians to keep eating meat during Lent by concealing it
  beneath the pasta shell and amidst the spinach filling from the eye
  of the parish priest (if not the omniscient Deity Himself). The
  following recipe is typical but far from definitive, especially where
  the ingre- dients for the filling are concerned.  Feel free to use
  whatever you have on hand or whatever your fancy (or your conscience)
  dictates.

 Categories: Gifts, Cake, Desserts, Fruits, Holidays
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
        6 ea carrot -- grated
    2 2/3 c  sugar
        1 lb raisins
    2 2/3 c  water
        2 TB butter
        2 ts cinnamon
        2 ts cloves, ground
        2 ts allspice
        2 ts salt
        4 c  flour
        4 ts baking soda
        1 lb pecans -- (or walnuts)
        1 lb candied fruit
  
  Combine carrots, sugar, water, raisins, salt and spices in a large
  pan and boil 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool. Stir in the
  flour, soda then the candied fruit and nuts. Pour batter into well
  greased and floured loaf pans or one large bundt pan. Bake in 325 to
  350 degree oven for one hour.
  
  If you wish to season this with spirits use about 1/2 cup of rum or
  brandy and after the cake has cooled thorougly, pour the alcohol
  gently over the cake. It may be best to do this just a little at a
  time over the period of 30 min. or so. Wrap tightly in foil and store
  in a cool place for as long a 3 months. After I give this cake as a
  gift, I recommendthat, after opening, it be stored in the
  refrigerator.

      1 c  Boiling water
      1 ts Baking soda
  2 1/4 c  Cake and pastry flour
    1/2 ts Salt
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter, at room
           -temperature
  2 1/2    Granulated sugar
      3    Eggs, separated
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract
      1 c  Sour cream
           ICING:
  1 1/4 c  Unsalted butter
      2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Milk
      4 c  Icing sugar, sifted
      2 tb Cocoa
           GARNISH:
      1 c  Strawberry jam or preserves
      1 tb Toasted sesame seeds
 
  Preheat the oven to 350øF.  Butter an 8 or 9 inch round cake pan and
  line the bottom with parchment paper or waxed paper. Butter an 8 or 9
  inch round-bottomed Pyrex casserole bowl and line the bottom with
  paper.
  
  To make the cake, combine the chocolate and water in the top of a
  double boiler.  Heat over gently simmering water until melted. Stir
  well and cool slightly.  Add the baking soda.
  
  Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder and reserve.
  
  Cream the butter until light.  Gradually beat in 2 cups granulated
  sugar. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, and then add the vanilla.
  
  Add the chocolate mixture to the egg-yolk mixture. Add the dry
  ingredients alternately with the sour cream, mixing just until the
  ingredients are blended.
  
  Beat the egg whites until light an gradually beat in the remaining
  1/2 cups granulated sugar.  Fold the whites gently but thoroughly
  into the batter.
  
  Pour the batter into the round cake pan until it is three-quarters
  full. Pour the remaining batter into the Pyrex casserole bowl. Bake
  for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the cakes feel firm when gently
  pressed at the top. Let the cakes cool for 10 minutes and then remove
  from the pans. Cool on racks.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the icing.  Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the
  brown sugar and cook for 2 minutes. Add the milk and bring to a boil.
  Cool.
  
  Beat in the sifted icing sugar until the icing is of spreading
  consistency. If it is too runny, add more sugar; if it is too stiff,
  add 1 tbsp. boiling water. Remove 1/2 cup icing and mix with the
  cocoa.
  
  To assemble, slice the cooled cake from the round pan in two
  horizontally. Place one half on the cake plate, Ice the top and sides
  with the butterscotch icing. Place the second half on top and ice
  with the cocoa frosting.  Spoon on the jam, allowing it to flow down
  the sides of the cake like ketchup.  Place the large casserole-shaped
  cake on top with the rounded side up. Spread with butterscotch icing.
  Sprinkle the top with sesame seeds.  Yield: One Large Cake Typed in

  bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and boil hard until the jelly
  stage is reached.  Remove jelly from heat, skim, and pour into hot,
  sterilized jelly glasses.  Seal at once with hot paraffin.
  
  Double the recipe if you have plenty of mayapple juice. The amount
  used in this recipe is the yield of about 2 cups of sliced mayapples
  simmered in 3 cups of water.
  
  Yield: Four small glasses of pale amber jelly with an almost tropical
  flavor.
  
  Serve mayapple jelly on hot breads or for a dessert with cream cheese
  and soda crackers.
  
  Note:  While  the author says to seal the jars with paraffin, I think
  this method is no longer recommended by canning experts, and I'd
  process in a hot water bath instead.

 Categories: Pileggi, Not exp, Try it

MMMMM------------------SEPHARDIC COOKING; MARK-----------------------

MMMMM---------------------------MATZOH--------------------------------

MMMMM--------------------------POTATOES-------------------------------

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
 
  Jewish, Africa, Egypt
        8    Matzohs, broken into 3" Pieces
        2    Eggs, beaten
        2 T  Corn oil
        1 lb Cooked chicken or beef, cut Into small cubes
        1 c  Onions, chopped
      1/4 t  Allspice
      1/4 t  Pepper
        1 t  Salt
      1/8 t  Nutmeg, grated
        1 lb Potatoes, peeled and Quartered
        2    Eggs, beaten
      1/4 t  Salt
      1/8 t  Pepper Lemon wedges
  
  1.  Moisten the matzoh in warm water for a few minutes to soften them
  and gently press out the excess liquid. Oil a 1-1/2 quart, heatproof
  glass or metal baking dish. Dip the matzoh pieces into the first 2
  beaten eggs and lay them in baking dish in an orderly layer.
  
  2.  In a skillet, heat the oil.  Add the meat, onions, allspice,
  pepper, salt, and nutmeg.  Stir-fry over moderate heat for 3 minutes.
  Spread the mixture over the matzoh in the baking dish.
  
  3. In a pan, boil the potatoes in water until soft but still firm. In
  a processor, puree the potatoes and spread the puree over the meat
  layer. Poke 8 holes about 1" deep in the puree.
  
  4.  In a bowl, beat the remaining 2 eggs with the salt and pepper.
  Pour the mixture over the potato puree. Bake in preheated, 375 degree
  F. over for 1/2 hour.
  
  Serve hot, cut into generous squares, with wedges of lemon. Makes 6
  to 8 servings.
  
  VARIATION:  Mayeena may be prepare as a dairy dish. Simply replace
  the meat with 2 cups (1 pound) of cottage cheese mixed with 1 cup
  grated yellow cheddar cheese. Scatter this over the matzoh in the
  baking dish and cover with the potato puree and egg.
  
  Bake in a preheated, 375 degree over for 1/2 hour.
  
  Passover food is limiting but the Egyptian Jews have artfully
  concocted a mayeena that conforms to the Passover ritual for both
  dairy and meat occasions.

  cover and cook until cheese melts. "This is the kind of recipe that
  can be varied as long as the soup is included and enough other liquid
  is added. It can be jazzed up with other veggies, and red and green
  pepper add color. For a Tex-Mex version, add canned chopped chiles
  and chopped black olives, chili powder and cumin. Although the cheese
  can be left off, it tastes better with it."

 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  Water
    3/4 c  Raw cashews or blanched
           Almonds
 
  Place water in blender, add nuts, blend at high for 60 seconds. Keep
  refrigerated, it will spoil.
  
  According to my Wellness Encyclopedia, here's the breakdown for 3/4
  cups of almonds; Calories 587 Fat 52 grams Protein 16 grams Saturated
  Fat 5 grams Carbo 24 grams
  
  That would make a 1 cup serving around 13 grams of fat, around 80%
  calories from fat ((13*9)/(587/4)).

  color of shredded lettuce. Put 1/3 of frosting into small bowl with
  just enough water to thin to consistency of buttermilk (pourable).
  Add a few drops yellow food coloring to resemble color or American
  cheese. Place a dab of frosting on flat side of each vanilla wafer
  and then a bit of tinted coconut. Place a Keebler cookie on top of
  that with a little bit of frosting and cover with flat sideof another
  vanilla wafer, using a little pressure to force some of the frosting
  to drip over sides resembling melted cheese. Wipe top of each
  assembled cookie in beaten egg white and sprinkle with a few sesame
  seeds before egg white can dry. Let stand at room temp until firm or
  set and wrap each in paper used to wrap the McDonald's hamburgers in.

      Title: MCT'S CONCH CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups/stews, Fish/shellf, Potatoes
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lg Onions, diced
      1    Bell pepper, diced
      2 lg Potatoes, peeled & cubed
      6 oz Bacon, cut in 1/4" dice
      1    15 oz. can tomato puree
      1    8 oz. bottle clam juice
      1    8 oz. can diced tomatoes in
           Juice
      2 lb Conch or clams, diced (see
           Note)
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Thyme, use fresh if
           Available
      2 ts Black pepper
      1    Bay leaf, crushed
      2 oz Hot sauce or salsa (see
           Note)
      1    Jalapeno pepper, finely
           Diced
 
  Saute bacon until soft-cooked; add green peppers and onion to skillet
  and saute to al dente stage. Place in a large pot and add tomato
  puree, diced tomatoes, clam juice, salt, pepper, bay leaf, thyme,
  potatoes, jalapeno, hot sauce, and conch.  Bring to a low boil for 15
  minutes, then simmer for 1 hour.  To hold until serving time, cool to
  room temp- erature and refrigerate.
  
  NOTE:  At McT's, the diced conch meat is marinated overnight in papaya
  juice to tenderize it.  The papaya juice can be rinsed off with a
  little left in to give a slight sweet flavor to the chowder. NOTE:
  The resaurant uses Pico Pica hot sauce, usually only available to the
  trade, but La Victoria hot salsa, which is more available, may be
  substituted, Buchholz says.
  
  From McT's Shrimp House and Tavern, 1523 Periwinkle Way, Sanibel

  version of McT's Conch Chowder. Recipe supplied by Lillian Austin,

      Title: MEAD  BY  EUELL GIBBONS
 Categories: Alcohol, Beverages, Honey
      Yield: 1 Gallon
 
      1 ga Water
      4 lb Honey
      6    Cloves
      2    Sticks cinnamon
           Juice & peel from one lemon
      1 ts Activated dry yeast
 
  In a large nonreactive pot, add the next four ingredients to the
  gallon of water.  Boil all together for 30 minutes, then strain into
  a crock that will hold it with a little room to spare. When cooled,
  add the yeast, dissolved in some of the liquid.  Allow to ferment in
  a cool place - 55 degrees is ideal - until it ceases bubbling and the
  liquor clears, then bottle, cap tightly and store in a cool, dark
  cellar. It should not be used for at least a month, and longer is
  better.
  
  Mead unlike many other drinks, does not improve with really long
  aging, so it should be consumed within a year of the time it was
  made. ;+}

MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Small red new potatoes
           -unpeeled
      1    Green pepper; seeded and
           -sliced crosswise into rings
      4    Hard-boiled eggs
    1/2 sm Red onion; thinly sliced and
           -separated into rings
    1/2 c  Pitted ripe black olives
           -sliced in half crosswise
    1/4 c  Parsley; minced

MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
      3 tb Fresh; dill snipped
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 ts Dijon mustard
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt; optional
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Steam the unpeeled potatoes until they are just tender when pierced
  with a fork, but not mushy.  If they are very small, leave them
  whole, or, when cool enough to handle, cut them in half or quarters
  with a very sharp knife, taking care not to pull off the skin. Place
  them in a large bowl, or on a serving platter surrounded by the green
  pepper rings.
  
  Slice the eggs crosswise, but remove and discard two of the yolks.
  Arrange the slices over the potatoes. Add the onion rings and olives,
  and sprinkle the salad with the parsley. In a small bowl, combine the
  dressing ingredients.  Pour the dressing over the salad. Either serve
  the salad as is, or toss it gently. The salad may be served at room
  temperature or chilled.  Source:  Jane Brody's Good Food Book.

      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Lemon juice
 
  Prepare basic meat balls. Drain mushrooms, saving liquid. After
  meatballs are browned, push to side of skillet, add mushrooms and
  brown over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add enough water to
  the mushroom liquid to make 1/2 cup; pour this liquid and tomato
  sauce over the meat balls. Bring to boil, cover skillet, reduce heat.
  Sprinkle in the flour a little at a time, stirring constantly to
  blend. Add pepper, garlic salt, evaporated milk, water and
  Worcestershire sauce in that order, stirring constantly. Return to
  low heat and cook until sauce is thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add

      Title: MEAT DUMPLINGS POACHED OR POT-STICKER STYLE
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Beef
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground or very finely
           -chopped pork or beef or 1/2
           -& 1/2
           Or 1/2 pork & 1/2 raw shrimp
           Marinade:
      6 tb Sesame oil
      2 ts Sugar
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 lb Cabbage (napa or Chinese,
           -preferred) or mix with bok
           -choy,
           Celery, carrot, etc.
      1 ts Salt
    1/3 lb Chopped green onions (use
           -whole onion w/o roots)
           Skin:
      3 c  Flour
    3/4 c  Cold water
    1/2 c  Flour to prevent sticking
           -during kneading.
     10 c  Boiling liquid (water or
           -stock optional)
 
  Filling: Chop the "meat" well and mix well with the marinade.
  
  Then chop the cabbage or veggie(s) fine and mix with 1 t. salt and
  let sit for 10 minutes; Squeeze out the excess water. Mix the veggie
  with the meat and green onions and mix well by hand.
  
  Skins: In a bowl, add water to the flour and knead into a smooth
  dough; let it stand for ten minutes. Then roll the dough into a long
  baton-like roll and cut into 50 pieces. (I just divide in 1/2 & 1/2 &
  1/2 etc and am satisfied with four dozen. At the end I can eyeball 3
  equal parts pretty accurately.)
  
  Use a rolling pin to roll each piece into a thin circle.
  
  Place 1 portion (50 th or 48th) of filling in the center of a dough
  circle. Fold the circle in half and moisten the edges with water. Use
  index finger and thumb to bring the sides together.
  
  Pleat the open edge together (into a semi-circle - sorta) keeping the
  other edge smooth. The smooth edge will yield to the length of the
  pleated edge. Pinch the pleats together to seal. Repeat for all
  dumplings.
  
  Boil 10 cups water or stock or mixture and add dumplings; stir to
  prevent from sticking together. Return to a boil, turn heat low and
  cook for six minutes. Remove. Serve with dipping sauces.
  
  I like to give each diner a small dipping bowl and provide Soy, Shao
  Hsing, Rice Vinegar, Sesame Oil, Hot Sesame oil, Finely chopped or
  grated Garlic, Ginger, Bean paste, Hot bean paste, Black Bean paste,
  Peanut paste as makings for each to mix their dip to their liking.
  
  YOU CAN CHEAT and buy ready made "gyoza" skins at most Chinese
  markets. If you are not too dexterous, get a dumpling press and you
  can stuff, fold, pleat, etc rapidly. Get more presses if you've a
  helper or two. Mine were under $2.00 if I remember. These are the
  same as you use for pierogi, etc.
  
  You can freeze these but wrap with separate partitions (I was
  successful rolling them in saran. I'd wrap one, roll, wrap one, roll,
  etc. When frozen and then cooked, as liquid returns to boil, lower
  and poach for 10 minutes. If they are going to be pot- stickers (next
  recipe) you can also steam them or poach in low liquid without
  covering.

           -JUDI M. PHELPS
  2 1/2 lb Lean ground beef
    1/2 lb Ground pork or
    1/2 lb Sausage meat
      2 lg Onions; chopped
      3 cl Garlic; minced
    1/2 c  Fresh parsley; minced
      2 ts Dried oregano
      2 ts Dried thyme
      2 ts Nutmeg
      2 ts Salt; optional
      1 ts Pepper
      3 tb Teriyaki sauce or
      1 tb Soy sauce; low sodium
           -preferred
      2 tb Dijon mustard
      1 c  Dry red wine
      2 c  Unsalted crackers; crushed
    1/2 c  Walnuts; finely minced
      2    Eggs; slightly beaten
    1/2 lb Cheddar cheese; cut into
           -1/8-inch slices
           Parsley sprigs
 
  Into a large bowl place all the ingredients except the cheese and
  parsley sprigs in the order given.  Knead the mixture well to mix
  thoroughly,. Divide the mixture in half and form each half into a
  compact loaf approximately 1 1/2 inches in depth.  Place the cheese
  on the top of one of the loaves and top with the other loaf. Pinch
  the loaves together well, to seal.  Place in a shallow roasting pan
  and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven 1 hour.  Remove from the
  oven. Slice the loaf and arrange slices on a a warm platter. Garnish
  with parsley sprigs.
  
  Judi's Notes:  I think a 400 degree oven is too high for meat loaf
  and so always bake my meat loaves at 350-375 degrees and just cook it
  a few minutes longer. I also like to remove some of the fat and
  juices that accumulate in the pan about half way through cooking by
  using a turkey baster to suction in out of the pan.

  Taylor.
    The following is in the introduction to the chapter of this book
  headed Pizza, Meat Pies, & Hand Pies.  If you have a Panasonic SDBT6P
  or a National SDBT6N you may make some of these breads on the Variety
  Bread Cycle.  This cycle enables you to remove the dough, place
  fillings into it and replace it into the machine for baking. Follow
  the directions given in your owner's manual.....
    Owners of all other machines should make the recipes on the dough
  setting, remove, fill according to following directions and bake (in
  your conventional oven). A small amount of flour may be used when
  rolling dough ro prevent if from sticking.
    To make the meat filling:  Cut cheese into 1-inch cubes and mix
  together with cooked, drained but still hot meats. Cheese should warm
  enough to serve as the "glue" for the filling. If cheese is not
  melting into meat, warm in microwave for a minute or two.  Roll as
  jelly-roll or stromboli... For jelly-roll - remove dough from machine
  and roll into a rectangle. Spread filling on top. Starting from wide
  end, roll dough jelly-roll fashine to encase filling, pince ends
  closed, - place on a nonstick bakin pan and let rise for 1/2
  hour.....OR For Stromboli - remove dough from machine and roll into a
  rectangle.  Spread filling ingredients over the middle third of the
  rectangle so it runs the lenght of the wide end. Fold one side over
  top of the filling and then the other sideon top ot that; pinch ends
  closed.  Place, seam side down, on a lightly buttered baking sheet,
  cover and let rise for about 30 minutes. Lightly olive oil top....
  Bake either way in a preheated 350 oven for 20 to 25 minutes.....

      3 tb Salt
      1 ts Garlic powder
    1/8 ts Cayenne pepper -- optional
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
 
  Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
  Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
  servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Baking pans are not needed for
  food to be served without freezing.
  
  Crumble beef; cook until lightly browned.  Stir in onion and pepper
  flakes. Drain off excess fat.  Stir remaining ingredients into meat
  mixture. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally for 1 hour or until
  flavors are blended.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Serve hot mixture over cooked macaroni,
  noodles, or spaghetti.
  
  TO FREEZE:  Pour each part to be frozen into a baking pan. Pack food
  tightly to avoid air pockets.  Cool for 30 minutes at room
  temperature. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food.
  Put edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies
  directly on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and
  seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing,
  and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about
  4 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing
  packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN SAUCE:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Remove freezer
  wrap. Place food in baking pan.  Bake 1 1/4 hours or until mixture is
  bubbly at edges and center is hot. Serve over cooked macaroni,
  noodles, or spaghetti.

  NOTES : This recipe is for 24 servings (about 3/4 cups each).
  Directions are given for dividing the prepared food into four parts
  of six servings each.  One part may be completely cooked and served
  at the time of preparation.  The remaining parts may be frozen.

      Title: MEATBALLS (SAME DAY)
 Categories: Italian, Beef
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground chuck
      3 ea While, smilin' eggs
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
      1 x  Salt and pepper to taste
      1 lb Ground pork
  1 1/2 c  Bread crumbs*
      4 ea To 6 garlic cloves*
      1 x  Fresh Basil leaves***
 
  * Or enough to hold the mixture together. Try to use leftover French
  or Italian bread, and whole wheat crumbs work well also. ** Chopped
  very fine *** If you have them on hand (GrandMa Rose always adds
  fresh basil) YIELD: 15-18 medium meatballs, or 40-45 tiny meatballs.
  Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Toss gently with your
  hands until the meat has become thoroughly blended with all the
  seasonings.
   The mixture should be farily moist. 2.  To form the meatballs, wet
  your hands in a small bowl of lukewarm water and then pick up about
  1/3 cup of the meatball mixture. Roll it in the palm of your hands to
  form a smooth ball about 1 inch in diameter. 3.  Drop the meatballs
  directly into your basic tomato sauce recipe. Or, if you prefer a
  crusty meatball, fry in approximately 3 tablespoons of olive oil on
  med heat for about 5 min, turning to brown evenly.  Then drop them
  into gently boiling tomato sauce as they are browned. Meatballs take
  about 20 min to cook well. (Remember to scrape the bottom of skillet
  and pour meat particles into sauce.)

      Title: MEATBALLS IN TOMATO SAUCE
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------SAUCE INGREDIENTS--------------------------
     13 oz Tomatoes, canned
           -(1 large can), coarsely
           -chopped, with juice
      4 oz Tomato sauce (1 small can)
      1    Garlic clove, minced
    1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
      1 ts Chili powder

MMMMM--------------------MEATBALL INGREDIENTS-------------------------
      1 lb Pork sausage
    1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
    1/2 c  Cracker crumbs
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese (grated)
      1    Egg
      1 lb Pasta (tagliarini,
           -spaghetti or whatever)
 
  Combine the sauce ingredients and bring to a boil while preparing the
  meatballs.  Mix all meatball ingredients. It is easiest to do this
  with your hands. Form into walnut-sized balls.
  
  Drop the meatballs into BOILING sauce.  If the sauce is not boiling,
  the meatballs will fall to pieces. Simmer gently for about an hour.
  If you are making the sauce to eat right away, you will probably want
  to skim the grease that cooks out of the sausage periodically. If you
  are making this ahead, the grease will congeal when it sits overnight
  in the refrigerator, and you can remove it easily then.
  
  Check for salt.  Depending on the brands of sausage and tomatoes you
  use, you may not need any. If you need to add salt, be sparing.
  
  Boil the pasta.  Pour the sauce and meatballs over it and serve with
  grated parmesan, or combine and reheat in a casserole, sprinkled with
  parmesan.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple meatballs in herb and garlic tomato sauce -- I've been
  making this recipe since I was about 10 years old, and I don't
  remember where we got it. It's easy and very good, though. Yield:
  serves 4-6.
  
  *  This is fine made a day ahead.  Chilling it gives you a chance to
  remove the grease that cooks out of the sausage.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: MEATLESS CHILI WITH CORN CHIPS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Mexican, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Dried kidney beans
      8 oz Soy tempeh, crumbled

      1 ts Chili powder divided
      1 c  Coarse chopped onions
    1/4 c  Dry sherry
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 c  Sliced mushrooms
      8    Chop tomatoes
      1 c  Minced green peppers
      1 c  Minced celery
      1 c  Minced carrots
    1/2 c  Minced mild chili peppers
           -(usually anahiems; could
           -use
           -canned)
      2 tb Minced jalapenos
      4    Cloves garlic
      4 c  Vegetable stock
      3 tb Tomato paste
           -Crushed corn chips for
           -garnish
 
  Soak beans in cold water to cover 8 hours or overnight. drain.
  
  Combine crumbled tempeh, wine, soy, cumin, basil, chili; let marinate
  for 2 hours at least.
  
  Meanwhile, in a 6 qt. pan over medium high heat, saute onions in
  sherry and oil 10 minutes, stirring. Add mushroom and cook 10 more
  minutes.
  
  Add tomatoes, green pepper, carrot, celery, chili, jalapenos, garlic.
  Saute stirring 5 minutes.
  
  Add beans, stock, tomato paste. Bring to boil, cover, lower heat,
  simmer 2 to 3 hours till beans are tender.
  
  Add tempeh and marinade. cook 10 minutes. Serve garnished with chips.
  
  NOTES: This is a midwestern chili (beans and tomatoes!). I added some
  leftover crushed tomatoes, and we garnished it with non-fat sour
  cream and chopped cilantro (better for you than corn chips). A more
  traditional chili style would be to relplace all tomatos with a red
  chili sauce: split and de-seed dry red anchos, anahiems, and/or
  gujanailos (sp?) and sear on a hot cast iron skillet. put in a bowl
  and cover by boiling water. let soak 20 min, then puree, maybe with a
  little garlic (and usually salt, but not for this recipe!). Use that
  instead of tomato paste and crushed tomato.

      1 tb Parsley Flakes
      1 ts Basil

  Saute onion in a little olive oil until soft.  In medium saucepan,

  thick, stirring occasionally (about 15-20 minutes).
  
  I use this sauce in my family favorite....lasagna.  If at any time you
  decide to add meat (it mixes in very well).....about 1 lb. of
  hamburger does great! Remember to brown it first though before adding
  remaining ingredients.

      1    Beurre Manie**

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Small glazed turnips
           Potato balls
 
  * BOUQUET GARNI - In a piece of cheesecloth, tie the following: 3 to 4
  sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 t dry
  thyme.  Leave the string long enough to hang the garni in the pot and
  tie the string to the pot handle for easy removal. ** Beurre Manie is
  used to thicken sauces.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T sweet butter on a
  small flat plate and blend the mixture with a fork into a very smooth
  paste. Roll the paste into a ball. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
  Butter a large flameproof baking dish and set aside. Start by making
  the sauce. In a heavy saucepan melt the clarified butter.  Add the
  minced vegetables and cook them over low heat for 5 to 8 minutes or
  until they are very soft but not browned. Add the flour and stir it
  until it is well blended with the vegetables.  Raise the heat a
  little and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes a
  hazelnut brown. Do not burn or scorch the bottom of the saucepan.  As
  soon as the flour mixture has turned nutty brown, add the hot brown
  stock all at once and stir until the mixture is smooth and lightly
  thickened. Add the Bouquet Garni, tomato paste, salt and pepper. Do
  not oversalt as the sauce will become saltier as it reduces.
  Partially cover the pan and simmer for 1 hour, stirring it from time
  to time. Strain the sauce and reserve. While the sauce is cooking,
  make the mustard butter. In a small bowl place the softened butter.
  Add the Dijon and dry mustard and blend the mixture well with a
  wooden spoon. Add the lemon juice and chill. THE PORK - In a large
  skillet melt the 2 T of butter and oil. Season the pork medallions
  with salt and white pepper. When the butter and oil are very hot, add
  the pork medallions, a few at a time, and brown them on both sides.
  As the medallions brown, remove them from the pan and set them aside.
  Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and cook them over low heat
  until they are soft but not browned. Add the meat glaze and the wine.
  Bring it to a boil and scrape the bottom of the pan well. Reduce the
  wine to 2 T. Add the strained sauce and bring it to a boil. Place the
  pork medallions in the buttered baking dish and pour the sauce over
  them. Cover the dish with foil and set it in the oven. Braise the
  pork for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven to
  the top of the stove. With a slotted spoon remove the pork to a
  serving platter. Raise the heat and reduce the sauce slightly,
  skimming off the fat. If it does not coat the spoon heavily, beat in
  the Beurre Manie, bit by bit, until the sauce reaches the right
  consistency. Add the minced capers and parsley and heat through.
  Remove the sauce from the heat and whisk in the Mustard Butter little
  by little until it is well incorporated into the sauce. Correct the
  seasoning, adding a good dash of black pepper. Spoon the sauce over
  the medallions and serve garnished with tiny glazed turnip and potato
  balls.

 Categories: Beef, Fruits, Harned 1994, Italian, Stews
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      3 lb Stew beef; cut in 1/2" cubes
      2 md Onions; chopped
           Cooking oil
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/4 ts Each cloves and cinnamon
    1/4 ts Each nutmeg, mace and pepper
      1 tb White vinegar; or to taste
           Salt; to taste
 
  Brown the beef in a skillet in a small quantity of oil. Place browned
  beef *and its juices* in a stewpot. Add more oil (if necessary) to
  the skillet; saute onions until tender and translucent.  Add onions
  to stewpot. Add raisins and spices to the meat mixture, along with a
  small quantity of water (approximately 1/2 cup). There should be just
  enough water to prevent scorching and to help form the gravy.
  
  Bring stew to a boil and reduce immediately to a simmer. Simmer,
  covered, until meat is tender (about 1-1/2 to 2 hours). Stir
  occasionally. Add water as necessary. When beef is cooked, add
  vinegar and salt. Cook a few minutes more.
  
  Carroll-Mann wrote: "This is a recipe I adapted from a 16th century
  translation of a medieval Italian cookbook. The recipe is called "Pie
  in a Pipkin" which means (crustless) meat pie in a stewpot. It has a
  nice thick gravy and a sweet/tart flavor."

      3 ts Salt
      5 tb Potato flour
    3/4 ts Pepper
    1/2 ts Ground nutmegs
    1/4 ts Ginger
      5 dl Milk
 
  Ground pork: Use a blend of minced fat and lean pork. Should contain
  about 20% fat. Milk: Should be high in fat. Potato flour: I guess
  corn starch will do just as well. Mix the meat with salt until
  sticky. Add flour and spices. Add milk, a little a time. Be sure the
  meat gets sticky between each time you add milk. The resulting blend
  should not be too firm. Make balls the size of a small child's fist.
  Fry in a hot frying pan, when the are chestnut brown put them in
  simmering water or broth. Takes about ten minutes to get finished.

      Title: MEDITERRAN TOMATO SOUP WITH PASTA
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables, Vegetarian, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 tb Olive Oil
      1 lg Onion, minced
  2 1/2 lb Ripe tomatoes, cut in large
           Dice
      4 lg Garlic cloves, chopped
      2 c  Chicken stock or any broth
  1 1/4 c  Water
  1 1/4 ts Dried leaf oregano crumbled
           Salt and freshly ground
           Pepper to taste
      1 c  Small pasta, such as thimble
           Shaped ditali (salad
           Macaroni)
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh basil
           Bowl of freshly grated
           Parmesan cheese (for serving
           If desired)
 
  Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion and
  cook, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes or until soft but not
  brown. Add tomatoes, garlic, stock, water, oregano, salt, and pepper;
  bring to a boil.  Cover and cook over low heat
       45    minutes.
  
  Puree soup in a food mill; or puree in a food processor and strain,
  pressing so pulp goes through strainer. (Soup can be kept, covered, 2
  days in a refrigerator.) Return soup to saucepan and reheat. If soup
  appears thin, simmer uncovered 2-3 minutes to thicken slightly.
  
  Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and add salt. Just before
  serving add pasta and cook uncovered over high heat, stirring
  occasionally, 5-8 minutes or until tender but firm to the bite. Drain
  well. Add to soup.
  
  Stir in 1 tablespoon basil.  Taste and adjust seasoning. Sprinkle with
  remaining 1 tablespoon basil. Serve with parmesan cheese, if desired.
  
  NOTE: Made this only when you have very ripe tomatoes ~ they are the
  soul of this soup while the ditali, or pasta thimbles, give it body.
  The soup is relatively easy to prepare because there is no need to
  peel or seed the tomatoes.   After cooking, they are pureed in either
  a food mill or food processor.  A garnish of tomato slices nad basil
  sprigs looks very attractive.
  
  This recipe came from a friends pasta cookbook.  It is great!!!

      2 c  French or Italian bread;
           -preferably day old
           -cut in 2 inch cubes
      1 tb Olive oil

    1/2 c  Green onions; thinly sliced
      4 c  Parsley leaves
           -coarsely chopped
      2 md Tomatoes; cut in 1/2 " cubes

MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
      2 tb Lemon juice
    3/4 ts -Salt
      1 lg Garlic cloves;finely chopped
    1/2 ts -pepper, black, ground
      1 ts Cinnamon, ground
    1/4 ts Allspice, ground
      9 tb Olive oil; extra virgin
 
  ""NOTE: After a couple of hours, the croutons will start to absorb the
  dressing. Some people like this; others (including the reviewer for
  Toronto Life!) do not. Time the addition of the croutons to suit your
  taste." Preheat oven to 350F. Spread the bread cubes on a large
  baking sheet & toss with the oil. Bake in the preheated oven until
  golden brown, turning them every few minutes. They will take 10 to 20
  minutes, depending on how fresh the bread is. Assemble the cucumber,
  peppers, green onion and parsley in a large bowl; leave out the
  tomatoes for now. Prepare the dressing: Stir the lemon juice, salt
  and garlic together until the salt dissolves. Add the pepper,
  cinnamon and allspice, then slowly beat in the olive oil. (May be
  prepared up to 12 hours ahead to this point.) Place the cut up
  tomatoes on top of the other vegetables. Pour on the dressing and
  toss well; add the croutons and toss again (see note).

  piece of dough into a 10-inch round. Sprinkle the cornmeal on 2
  nonstick baking sheets or pizza pans. Place the dough on the pans,
  prick all over with a fork, and bake 15 minutes. Top the pizzas with
  the chopped vegetables and bake 5 minutes longer. Remove the pizzas
  from the oven and sprinkle with the basil, oregano, and thyme on top.

           Peanut or corn oil
           -(for deep-frying)
    1/4 lb Dried rice stick noodles
      6 oz Med shrimp
           - shelled and deveined
      1    Whole boned chicken breast
           - cut into slices
      4    Shallots; minced
      1 tb Minced garlic
      2 sm Serrano chiles
           - finely minced
      1    Lime (zest only)
  3 1/2 tb Tomato paste
      4 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
      3 tb Fresh lime juice
      4    Green onions; trimmed,
           - cut into 1-in lengths
           - blanched
      3 tb Fresh coriander leaves
    1/2 lb Bean sprouts; tails removed
           - (for garnish)

MMMMM----------------------CRISPY EGG LACE---------------------------
           Oil for deep-frying
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  COVER TAMARIND WITH 3/4 CUP hot water. Crush and break up pulp with a
  fork and let it stand for 20 minutes. Pour mixture through a strainer
  and press it through. Collect 1/2 cup tamarind liquid. Pour oil into
  a wok or deep saucepan to a depth of about 2-inches. Heat oil to
  375F. In a large paper bag pull rice stick noodles apart into small
  batches. Add 1 batch to the oil. If the temperature is correct,
  noodles should puff up within seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon or
  strainer and drain on paper towel. Repeat with remaining noodles. If
  you are making the Crispy Egg Lace, prepare it at this time (See
  below). When the rice stick noodles and egg lace are done, pour off
  all but 2 tablespoons of oil from wok. Reheat wok and oil over
  medium-high heat. When hot, add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry for 1
  minute or until shrimp are bright orange and chicken is white. Remove
  and set aside. Add shallots, garlic, minced chiles and half the lime
  zest to the hot wok; stir-fry until soft, but not browned (about 1
  minute). Add tomato paste and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until
  sugar becomes a dark crimson red with a sticky consistency. It should
  pull away from the wok into a thick mass. This is just short of the
  caramelized state (about 3 to 4 minutes). Be careful not to burn the
  mixture. Immediately add the reserved tamarind liquid and fish sauce,
  reduce to low heat and simmer together for 1 minute. Add lime juice,
  reserved chicken-shrimp mixture, green onion and remaining lime zest;
  toss just enough to heat through. Remove from heat. Add 1/3 of fried
  rice stick noodles to the sauce. Gently crush noodles and toss with
  sauce to coat. Repeat with another third of noodles. Add last third
  of noodles only if there is enough sauce to coat. Toss in the
  coriander leaves. Mound noodles on a platter, Crispy Egg Lace (broken
  into smaller pieces) and bean sprouts.
  
  CRISPY EGG LACE: After frying noodles, skim leftover bits from wok.
  Keep oil hot. Beat eggs with salt in bowl. When oil is 375F, hold a
  medium-fine-mesh skimmer over oil; gently pour half the eggs through.
  Let eggs drip into oil in circular fashion. Deep-fry for 30 seconds
  or until lightly brown and crisp. Turn over to brown. It should have
  an irregular lacy shape. Remove and drain on paper towels. Keep in a
  warm oven. Break into smaller pieces. Makes 2 crispy egg laces. ~--

      Title: MEE KROB (CRISP-FRIED NOODLES)
 Categories: Thai, Chicken, Seafood, Pork, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 tb Fish sauce
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      2    Limes, juice only
      3 tb Vinegar
    1/4 c  Brown sugar or half brown
           -and half palm sugar
           Oil, for deep-frying
      6 oz Rice sticks
      4    Eggs, lightly beaten
      1 md Onion, finely diced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 sm Red or green chile, seeds
           -removed, finely minced
    3/4 lb Minced pork, diced chicken,
           -or peeled shrimp, or a
           -mixture
      2    Green onions, sliced, for
           -garnish
 
  This special occasion noodle dish is a favorite in many Thai
  restaurants. Some versions are extremely sweet and sticky; this
  version is less so, but the important flavors are still sweet, sour,
  and salty in that order. Be sure to use a large enough pan for
  saucing the noodles (step 5); a 14-inch wok is ideal.
  
  1. In a small bowl, combine fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice,
  vinegar, and sugar and set aside.
  
  2. In a wok or deep skillet, heat oil to 350 degrees F. Drop
  approximately an ounce of rice sticks into the oil; they will puff up
  and rise to the top of the oil in only a few seconds. Turn them over
  once and fry until crisp, about 15 seconds in all. Transfer finished
  noodles to a pan lined with paper towels and continue frying the
  batter in small batches. Keep noodles warm in a low oven.
  
  3. Dip a hand in the beaten egg and, holding your hand approximately 8
  inches above the hot oil, drizzle egg over the surface in a random
  pattern. Continue with about half the egg mixture, forming a lacy
  network of egg. Fry until golden brown on underside, turn over once,
  and brown other side. Transfer to a plate and drain on paper towels.
  Repeat with remaining egg.
  
  4. Heat a second wok over medium high heat and add approximately 2
  tablespoons oil from the first wok. Add onion, garlic, and chile and
  cook until they are fragrant. Add meats or shrimp and stir-fry just
  until done.
  
  5. Stir sugar mixture and add to wok. Bring to a boil and cook until
  slightly thickened. Reduce heat to low and add about a quarter of the
  fried noodles and eggs. Stir together and toss to break up noodle
  clumps and coat with sauce. Continue adding noodles and eggs in
  batches until all are coated with sauce. Transfer to serving platter
  and garnish with sliced green onion.
  
  Serves 4 with other dishes.

      Title: MEE KROB (SWEET THAI NOODLES)
 Categories: Thai, Pasta, Misc
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar (white granulated)
      1 c  Vinegar (white)
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 lb Dried shrimp (Kung Haeng)
      8 ea Serrano chilies
      1 bn Green onions (whites only)
      8 oz Tofu, firm or extra firm
      3 ea Eggs
      2 c  Vegetable oil (approx. amnt)
    1/4 lb Rice noodles (very thin)
 
  1.  Combine the water, sugar, vinegar, and salt in a small saucepan.
  Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and cook about ten minutes, until
  it forms a thin syrup. Set aside.
  
  2.  Put the dried shrimp in a sieve and rinse them thoroughly under
  running water.  Set them aside in the sieve to drain. Remove the
  stems, but not the seeds, from the chilies. Slice the green onions
  and chilies lengthwise into thin strips and set them aside together.
  
  3.  Slice the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and set aside. Beat the eggs
  lightly, until they are well mixed but not frothy. Strain through a
  fine sieve and set aside.
  
  4.  Pour about three inches of oil in a wok and heat it to 400
  degrees F. Dry the tofu with paper towels and deep fry it until the
  cubes are firm and light golden, but not dry and hard. Remove them
  from the oil and set aside to drain on paper towels.
  
  5.  Using the same oil, deep fry the noodles a handful at a time. The
  noodles will puff up immediately and begin to turn brown in about ten
  seconds.  (Note: these are the same type of noodles that are used to
  make chinese chicken salad.)  Be careful not to let them burn. They
  should be light golden and very puffy. If they do not expand
  immediately upon touching the oil, the oil is not hot enough.  If
  they turn dark immediately, the oil is too hot.  Scoop the noodles
  out to drain on paper towels.  Remove about half the oil from the wok
  and save it for another use.
  
  6.  Dribble the beaten, sieved eggs over the surface of the hot oil
  in the wok, to form narrow strands: holding the bowl of eggs in one
  hand, dip the other into the eggs, stretch it out about 12 inches
  over the oil, and let the egg run in a thin, steady stream from your
  fingertips while moving your hand in a circular motion so the surface
  of the oil is covered wit a thin net of egg.  You will need to repeat
  this procedure about four times. The intent is to create a thin net
  of egg strands that will cook quickly without massing together. When
  the strands are set completely and light golden on the bottom, flip
  them over carefully and brown the other side. Remove from the oil and
  drain on paper towels.
  
  7.  Dry the shrimp thoroughly with paper towels. Using the same oil,
  deep fry the shrimp until they are just crisp and light golden, about
  three minutes.  Be prepared for the very strong smell they produce as
  they fry, but don't be concerned, since the shrimp will taste nothing
  like they smell.  (You may wish to do this well in advance of the
  time your guests will arrive and set the shrimp aside to drain on
  paper towels.) They will form a great deal of foam while they are
  frying, and it will be necessary to use a strainer to lift them up
  occasionally to see how well they are cooking.  Do not over cook them
  or let them get dry or hard! Remove them from the oil and drain on
  paper towels. Discard the remaining oil.
  
  8.  Clean the wok thoroughly and place half the sugar syrup from step
  1 in it.  Heat the syrup almost to boiling, but do not let it boil.
  Add half the noodles, half the egg nets (see the variation below),
  half the tofu, and half the shrimp.  Mix gently until the syrup is
  absorbed, being careful to break the noodles as little as possible.
  Remove the mixture from the wok and place it on a serving platter.
  Repeat this step with the rest of the syrup, noodles, eggs, and
  shrimp.
  
  9.  Garnish the Mee Krob with the green onion whites and chilies.
  Serve immediately or hold it at room temperature for up to two hours.
  
  VARIATION:  If the eggs have formed attractive nets (you should be so
  lucky!), you may drape them over the Mee Krob as a garnish rather than
  adding them in step 8.

      4 tb Fresh cilantro, chopped
      2    Green onions, cut for

  Optional stuff: crab meat, bean curd, dried shrimp
  
  Tear noodles into handful bunches (inside a large shopping bag to
  avoid a mess).  Heat oil and fry the noodles until they puff up. Flip
  over for a few seconds. Do this by bunches and drain in bag. Pour off
  oil, leaving 6 tablespoons in wok.  Fry the onions and garlic lightly.
  
  Add pork and cook it through.  Add chicken and fry until it turns
  white. Put in mushrooms and chilies and reduce heat. In a bowl,
  combine soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, sugar and fish sauce. Add to
  wok and simmer until liquid is reduced by half and starting to turn
  syrupy. Add shrimp and cook for 1 minute.  Push contents of wok to
  the sides and pour beaten eggs into center of wok.  Let set for a
  minute then stir and add the bean sprouts and drained noodles.  Toss
  LIGHTLY (the noodles are fragile) to mix ingredients and then let
  heat through. Transfer to serving platter and garnish with cilantro
  and green onions.
  
  NOTE:  Rice vermicelli are also known as rice sticks or cellophane
  noodles depending on where you find them. All the Asian cuisines that
  I've encountered have some variation of them. Use the thinnest you
  can find. Other kinds of noodles won't work.  When they hit the hot
  oil, they kinda go "whooosh" and double or triple in size and turn a
  milky white. Kids really like to watch the process. The oil MUST be
  fresh and hot (375F to 400F) or the centers may be tough.
  
  This recipe makes enough for 6-8 people.  I'd recommend halving it
  for less than that.  It's a sweet/sour dish with the emphasis on the
  sweet. Very tasty and rich.

 Categories: Indian, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Squash, butternut
      3 tb Oil
    1/2 ts Fenugreek seeds
    1/2 ts Hing
      1 tb Coriander, ground
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
           Salt, kosher; to taste
      1 ts Mango powder
      3 tb Jaggery, powdered
 
  Place the squash on the side on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife,
  cut its stem end off, then halve it (if necessary use a mallet to
  force the blade of the knife into the squash). Scoop out the seeds
  and fibers from each squash half, the scrape the flesh to remove
  clinging fibers. Cut each half into 1 1/2 inch wedges and peel the
  hard skin off. Cut the meat into
    1 1/2    inch pieces and set aside.
  
  Measure out the spices and place them right next to the stove in
  separate piles.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high
  heat until very hot.  Add the fenugreek seeds and fry until they turn
  dark brown (about 10 seconds) add the asafetida, coriander, and
  pepper. Stir once and immediately add the squash. Stir rapidly to
  distribute the spices (about 3 to 4 minutes). Sprinkle on salt to
  taste; stir. Lower the heat and cook, covered, until the squash is
  cooked but still holding its shape (about 15 minutes). Uncover and
  sprinkle on the mango powder. Reduce the heat to medium and turn-fry
  for 2 minutes.  Add the jaggery and cook until it melts and coats the
  vegetables (3-4 minutes). Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold.

  2 1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Dried mint leaves
      5 c  Water
      1    Small hot pepper
    1/2    Juice of 1 lemon
 
  Wash zuchinni and cut off tips.  Using a small sharp knife, scoop out
  the insides.  Combine meat and rice in a large mixing bowl. In a
  blender, combine 1/2 tomato, water, garlic clove, onion, mint , salt
  & pepper and blend in a blender until smooth.  Mix with the meat and
  rice mixture. Stuff mixture into the zuchinni and place in a pressure
  cooker. Mix the remaining garlic, onion, tomato, salt, mint,
  water,pepper, salt & Pepper & blend. Add to pressure cooker, along
  with the dried mint. Cook in pressure cooker on low after pressure
  rises to maximum allowed pressure and cook for 20 minutes.  Allow
  pressure to release of its own accord. Add the juice of 1/2 lemon and
  check for salt. Although I haven't tried it, I believe this could be
  cooked in the oven in the same manner if the rice is cooked first.
  Starred <*> ingredients are those used in the stuffing. The rest are

           -Melanie Miguel MJNT73C
           UNFORMATED RECIPE
 
  I just made these and they are SO SWEET that I think my lips are now
  permanently puckered! 1 quart whole milk, heated to a temp of 110F.
  (I did this in a large fry-pan. Stir in 2 well-beaten egg yolks. (Do
  this quickly) Dissolve 3 rennett tablets in 1 TBSP cold water - this
  is a little difficult. I had to really smash them up. When dissolved,
  add it to the milk mixture. Cover (I used a small towel) and leave it
  in a warm spot for about 1 hour. When the mixture looks set, take a
  knife and cut down the middle vertically and horizontally, and then
  cut through the center of each triangle again. Put the mixture back
  on the stove on the lowest setting. (I had to put the grid from the
  other side of my cooktop on top of the other grid to get the
  temperature low enough. If it looks like it's boiling, the temp is
  too high). When the pieces start to move apart from each other (about
  15 minutes later) you will need to add 1 pound piloncillo or light
  brown sugar around the spaces in between each piece. This takes a
  little time and patience. Let it cook for 2 more hours on this low
  setting. When done, let it cool at room temperature. Then, roll the
  pieces up, starting at the tip, and secure with a toothpick. Put the
  pieces in another dish, and pour the syrup from the pot over the
  chongos. They should be eaten at room temperature and can be stored
  for a few days in the refrigerator, but cannot be frozen. This is the
  perfect dish for someone craving "something sweet"! P.S. Almost
  forgot - stick a few pieces of cinnamon around with the brown sugar.

  the above together and use as you would any salsa. CHIPOTLE SALSA: 2
  large ripe tomatoes; Simmer in a small amount of water for 3-4
  minutes; peel, and place in a blender or food processor with; 1 or 2
  chile chipotle from a can (these are smoked, pickled jalapenos in a
  vinegar-tomato sauce), add a little of the sauce, too, if you want
  more heat - be careful, these are quite hot! add to tomato and blend
  6-7 seconds. Salt to taste. SALSA: On the open flame of a stove on a
  grill, or on a non-stick griddle on high heat, lightly char: 2 large
  very ripe tomatoes, 2 garlic cloves, 1 or 2 small hot peppers (chile
  verde, jalapeno, serrano, arbol). Let the tomatoes cool a bit and
  peel. Meanwhile, in a molcajete, mash the other ingredients together.
  Add the tomato and mash that, too. You may have to transfer some to a
  bowl. Put it into a small bowl and add 1/2 diced sweet onion, and 1/2
  cup diced cilantro. Salt to taste.  If you don't have a molcajete, or
  mortar & pestle, mash the ingredients with a fork instead. SALSA
  YUCATECA: 1 chile habanero (there is no substitute!), charred as
  above and mashed, the juice from one key lime (or lime), 2 Tbsp olive
  oil, 1 garlic clove, roasted and mashed, salt to taste. Place the
  ingredients in a small dish or bowl & mix together. Try this in
  chicken soup! P.S. When roasting garlic, do it with the peel on.
  Remove after roasting!

      Yield: 20 Sandwiches
 
      2 lb Aubergine; sliced crosswise
           -1/4" thick
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  2 1/4 c  Olive oil, extra-virgin
    1/4 ts Pepper
      6 oz Mozzarella, fresh; sliced
           -1/8" thick
      2 oz Anchovy fillets
    1/4 c  Basil, fresh; plus several
           -sprigs for garnish

    1/2 c  Flour
      3 c  Bread crumbs, fresh
           Marinara Sauce; as
           -accompaniment (opt)
 
  Layer the eggplant slices in a colander, sprinkling each layer with
  the salt.  Set aside to drain for at least 1 hour. Pat the eggplant
  dry with paper towels.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F.  Using 1/4 c. of the olive oil, brush both
  sides of each eggplant slice.  Arrange the slices in a single layer
  on 2 large baking sheets. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once,
  until the eggplant is tender when pierced with a fork but still holds
  its shape.
  
  Remove from the oven; season with eggplant with the pepper. Cover
  half the eggplant with mozzarella. Finely chop the anchovies and
  basil together; sprinkle over the cheese. Cover with the remaining
  eggplant slices to form sandwiches.
  
  In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with 2 teaspoons of water and 2 tea-
  spoons of the olive oil.  Coat the eggplant sandwiches with the
  flour, dusting off any excess. Dip into the beaten egg, then coat the
  sand- wiches thoroughly with the bread crumbs, pressing gently to
  adhere.
  
  In a large heavy skillet, heat the remaining oil over moderately high
  heat to 375F or until a small bread cube browns in about 1 minute.
  Fry the eggplant sandwiches in small batches until golden, 1 to 2
  minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper
  towels. Arrange the sandwiches on a platter or plates and serve on
  their own or with Marinara Sauce, garnished with sprigs of fresh
  basil.
  
  (The eggplant sanndwiches can be assembled and fried early in the
  day. Set aside on a cookie sheet at room temperature and reheat in a
  400F oven for about 5 minutes just before serving.)

      Title: MELANZANE SOTT'OLIO D'OLIVA (MARINATED EGGPLA
 Categories: Italian, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 md Eggplants (about 3 1/2 lbs)
    1/2 c  Salt
      1 qt White vinegar
      1 c  Extra virgin olive oil
      3 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Chopped garlic
      1 ts Crushed red pepper
      1 tb Dried oregano OR
  2 1/2    Fresh oregano
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  1. Slice the skins off the eggplants, and slice them about 1/4 inch
  thick from top to bottom. Then slice across to get pieces the size of
  French fries. Put the eggplant strips in a bowl and toss with the 1/2
  cup of salt. 2. Move the eggplant strips into a colander, arraying
  them in a relatively uniform layer up the sides. Put a bowl the same
  size as the colander inside the colander and weigh it down with three
  or so pounds of weight. [I find a foil covered common solid brick is
  a handy kitchen tool] Put the entire apparatus in the sink to drain
  for 45 minutes. This will remove any bitterness from the eggplant. 3.
  Rinse the salt off the eggplant with cold water. Drain it well, then
  SQUEEZE it dry. Put the eggplant in a bowl with the vinegar, and
  marinate it for 30 minutes. [It will return to shape like a wet
  sponge] 4. Drain the vinegar from the eggplant and squeeze it dry
  again. Put the eggplant into a bowl with all the other ingredients.
  5. Pour the contents into a canning jar. Make SURE therre is enough
  olive oil to completely cover all the eggplant about 1/2 inch deep.
  Tightly seal and refrigerate the jar. Marinate for at least a week;
  the ideal time is actually three months, and the eggplant will keep
  getting better even after that.

 Categories: Soups, Egyptian, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    125 g  Dried melokhia leaves -=OR=-
      1 kg Fresh melokhia leaves*
  1 1/2 l  Strong stock
           Salt
           Black pepper
     25 g  Olive oil
      3 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
      1 tb Ground coriander
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  Crush the dried Melokhia leaves. Put them in a bowl and moisten with a
  little hot water. Set aside until they swell and double in bulk. If
  the leaves are not brittle enough to crumble, dry them out in a warm
  oven for a few minutes. If fresh leaves are being used, wash them
  thoroughly and cut off the stalks. Spread the leaves out on a clean
  cloth to dry. Chop them finely.
  
  Put the stock in a large saucepan (you can use any stock, except
  pork). Season with salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Add the
  chopped or crumbled leaves and simmer for 10 minutes if the leaves
  are fresh and for 30 minutes if dry.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the "Taklia" or garlic sauce. Melt the butter in a
  small frying-pan. Add the garlic and fry, stirring, until it is
  golden brown. Add the coriander and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 2
  minutes. Add the garlic mixture to the soup, cover the pan, and
  simmer for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust the seasoning and
  serve.
  
  * "Melokhia is a soup made from an Egyptian herb similar to spinach.
  It is one of the national dishes of Egypt. Melokhia leaves are
  available dried from Greek shops, and occasionally the fresh leaves
  are available in some markets." If you can't get Melokhia, try this
  recipe with spinach. Works for me!

      Title: MELOMACARONA
 Categories: Cookies, Greek, Christmas
      Yield: 40 Pieces
 
  1 1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Butter, unsalted
           -(at room temperature)
      1 c  Beer
    3/4 ts Cinnamon, ground
    1/4 ts Ground cloves, ground
           Orange peel (use the
           -grated peel of one orange)
      1 c  Sugar
      2 c  Semolina, finely ground
      6 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Sugar (for the syrup)
  1 1/2 c  Honey
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
 
  Put the olive oil, butter, beer, cinnamon, cloves, orange peel and
  sugar in a mixing bowl and beat until they are thoroughly blended.
  
  Sift about one cup of flour with the baking soda, baking powder and
  salt and blend into the mixture. Add the semolina, a cup at a time,
  into the mixture.
  
  Add the enough of the remaining flour, a cup at a time, until you get
  a rather firm dough (you may need a bit more or less than the amount
  mentioned in the ingredients list). Use your hands to do the mixing,
  as an electric mixer will be useless after the first two or three C
  of flour have been added.
  
  Roll the dough into cylinders, about two inches long and one inch in
  diameter, flatten them with your hands, and place them on cookie
  sheets greased with a little olive oil. Bake at 350 degrees F. for
  half an hour. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool for
  about half an hour.
  
  Make the syrup:  mix the sugar, honey and water, and bring them to a
  boil. Cook on low heat for three minutes and skim off the foam that
  forms on top. Pour the hot syrup over the cookies, sprinkle them with
  the chopped walnuts and let them soak overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional greek Christmas cookies soaked in honey syrup -- This
  is one of the two kinds of confection that are traditionally consumed
  in large quantities in Greece during the holiday season (the other is
  kourabiedes). I suppose the name translates to something like "honey
  macaroons", except that they are not really macaroons. I got the
  recipe from a greek cookbook.
  
  *  You can use flour instead of semolina, but only as a last resort,
  as you won't be able to get that wonderful grainy texture which you
  get if you use semolina.
  
  *  The amounts given here are for only half a recipe. Considering
  that it is very hard to eat only one melomacarono, making the full
  recipe may not be as outrageous as it sounds!
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking, 30 minutes
  cooling, overnight soaking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: MELOMAKARONA * PHOENIKIA
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 40 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Honey
  1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Water
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 lb Finely chopped walnuts
  1 1/4 c  Sweet butter; softened
      4 ts Ground cinnamon (or more)
  1 1/2 c  Light vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
      2    Lg. oranges' strained juice
      2 tb Cognac or brandy
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      6 c  All-purpose flour (or more)
      2 oz Finely chopped walnuts
 
  (Author's Note): Ancient and traditional small, spicy baked syruped
  cakes, these are perfect for a large buffet.  The nickname asserts
  their introduction into Greece by the Phoenicians, but not with these
  ingredients!  Within my lifetime I have seen the oil give way to
  butter and semolina succumb to flour. Combine the honey, granulated
  sugar, water, and lemon juice in a saucepan and boil for 5 minutes.
  Remove from the heat. Combine the 1 pound finely chopped walnuts with
  1/4 cup of the softened butter, 2 teaspoons of the cinnamon, and 5
  tablespoons of the syrup. Reserve the remaining syrup and set the
  filling aside while you prepare the dough. Using an electric mixer,
  cream the remaining butter (1 cup) with the oil until light and
  fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar, beating on medium
  speed.  Add the orange juice slowly to the batter, along with the
  Cognac or brandy, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and the other spices.
  In a small bowl, sift the baking powder, soda, and 2 cups of the
  flour together. Slowly add the flour mixture to the batter and beat
  for a few minutes. Continuing to mix by hand, add only enough
  remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead. Break off small pieces
  of the dough and shape with your fingers into oblongs about
  2-1/2-inches long and 1-inch high. Flatten between your palms and
  place 1 teaspoon of the filling mixture in the center.  Work the
  dough around the filling to enclose it completely and press firmly to
  seal.  This procedure sounds difficult, but with many hands it is
  quite simple. Place on a cookie sheet and continue until all the
  cakes are shaped.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes,
  then cool on a rack.  Bring the syrup back to a boil. Dip each cake
  into the syrup and arrange on a platter. Sprinkle with the remaining
  chopped walnuts and teaspoon cinnamon, or more if desired. Cool
  before storing. Note: You may bake and cool melomakarona, store a few
  days in advance and dip in syrup as described above a day or so
  before serving. The flavor improves after a few days.

      Yield: 48 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      7 c  All-purpose unbleached flour
           Extra flour for kneading
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Mild olive oil

      3    Oranges; zested and juiced
      4 ts Freshly ground cinnamon
  1 1/2 ts Freshly ground clove
    3/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg

MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
      1 lb Honey; (1 lb = about 2 cups)
      1 c  Sugar
      1    1-inch piece of cinnamon
      1    Clove
      1    Lemon; zested and juiced
      1 c  Water

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Shelled almonds
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Freshly ground cinnamon
 
  Author's note: These cakes are traditionally served at Christmas. This
  recipe comes from my neighbor, Andonia. I have a distinct memory of
  her beating the oil and sugar into the flour until it dissolved using
  her middle finger and forefinger as a beater - though a spoon will do.
  
  Start by making the syrup.  Put the honey, sugar, cinnamon, clove, and
  lemon zest in a saucepan and add the water. Bring to a boil and
  simmer for 5-10 minutes. Add the lemon juice, then chill.
  
  To blanch the almonds, plunge them into boiling water for 1-2 minutes,
  until you see signs of their skins loosening. Then drain and slip or
  pop them from their skins onto a baking sheet. Toast them in an oven
  preheated to 350 F for about 10 minutes - just until they begin to
  color. Cool, then chop them very, very finely - if you do this in a
  food processor, make sure that the pulses are short, or the nuts
  could turn oily. Mix the ground almonds with the sugar and cinnamon
  and reserve.
  
  Sift the flour, baking soda and salt together.  Put the olive oil and
  sugar in a large bowl and beat together - with your fingers like
  Andonia - or with a wooden spoon. Beat in the Cognac, the orange
  zest, spices, and juice from 2 oranges (about 1/2 cup).
  
  Then beat in the flour, a few spoonfuls at a time, until you have a
  malleable dough, adding more flour if it is too soft, and more orange
  juice if it is too stiff. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and
  knead for 10-15 minutes until very smooth.
  
  Pinch off pieces of dough of about 2 tablespons and form into
  flattened oval or lozenge shapes.  Place them on an oiled or
  non-stick baking sheet. Bake in an oven preheated to 400-425 F for
  about 20 minutes, until brown.
  
  When they are cool enough to handle, dip them in the bowl of syrup for
  about 1 minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a tray to
  cool. Sprinkle with the chopped almond mixture.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lg Ripe honeydew melon
    1/4 c  Orange juice
      2    Pieces stem ginger, thinly
           -sliced
      2 tb Stem ginger syrup
           Fresh grated nutmeg to taste
      2    Kiwifruit, peeled, cut in

      8    Black grapes, cut in half,
           -seeded
           Fresh mint sprigs (opt)
           Ice cream
 
  Cut a thin slice off one of rounded sides of melon (not pointed
  ends), so melon will sit level on a serving plate.
  
  To form a handle, make 2 cuts about 3/4" wide on either side of a
  central strip. Continue cutting halfway down melon, then cut from
  bottom of handle around either side of fruit so these two wedges can
  be lifted away to form a basket shape. Cut away flesh from inside
  handle. Remove seeds from melon. Scoop out balls with a small melon
  scoop or cut flesh in pieces and place in a bowl. Smooth edge of
  melon basket.
  
  Add orange juice, stem ginger and syrup and nutmeg to melon balls and
  stir lightly. Add kiwifruit, lychees, strawberries and grapes and mix
  lightly. Spoon mixture into melon and arrange fruits attractively.
  Cover and chill. Garnish with mint sprig, if desired, and serve with
  ice cream.
  
  VARIATION: Use fresh fruits such as cherries, pineapple, peaches,
  figs and nectarines. Substitute freshly squeezed lime juice for
  orange juice.

  sandwich Saturday with mustard instead of mayonnaise. Better than I
  would have feared. But the big discovery of the week is Margaret's
  X-rated melon balls. Yield: Serves 4.
  
  *  In truth, I have to report that Margaret herself thought the
  garlic was too much; but I didn't.
  
  *  This recipe is not wholly unrelated to fruit curry, another
  godsend for the overplump.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2    Medium-size avocado
    1/2 ts Lemon juice
      1    Medium-size, ripe seasonal
           -melon (i.e. ogen,
           -cantaloupe or honeydew)
      1    Celery heart, chopped
      4 oz Strawberries, hulled and
           -sliced
      8 oz Cooked, peeled prawns
           -(thawed if frozen)
      2    Little Gem lettuces, rinsed
           -and torn into pieces
           For the dressing:
      8 oz Strawberries
      1 ts Caster sugar
      2 ts Olive oil
      1 tb Unsweetened orange juice
      2 ts Chopped fresh parsley
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper
 
  Preparation time: 20 minutes           Freezing: not recommended
  
  Peel and chop the avocado and place it in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle it
  with the lemon juice to prevent it from discolouring.
  
  Halve the melon, discard the seeds and scoop out the flesh using a
  melon baller (or cut it into cubes).
   Gently combine the melon, chopped celery, strawberries and prawns
  with the avocado and refrigerate until needed.
  
  Meanwhile, puree the dressing ingredients in a food processor or
  liquidiser. Arrange the lettuce on 4 plates and divide the prawn
  mixture between them. Pour the dressing over and serve immediately.
  
     Cook's notes: when melons are ripe they should 'give' slightly when
  pressed at the stalk end.
  
  Wrap up melons well if storing them in the refrigerator as otherwise
  they will permeate everything around them with their heady scent.

      Title: MELROSE AVENUE SPRING ROLLS
 Categories: Appetizers, Oriental
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Chorizo sausage
           - or any other spicy sausage
      1 oz Rice sticks
      6    Dried Chinese blk. mushrooms
      2 c  Shredded green cabbage
      2 c  Bean sprouts
      1 c  Julienned carrots
      2    Green onions; minced
      2 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Oriental sesame oil
      1 ts Chinese chili sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar
      3    Garlic cloves
           - finely minced
      2 tb Cornstarch
      2 tb Cooking oil; PLUS:
      3 c  Cooking oil
     12    Spring roll skins
      2    Eggs; beaten
           Dipping sauce of your choice
     20    Bibb lettuce leaves
 
  ADVANCE PREPARATION: If the sausage is in links, slit the casing and
  squeeze the meat out.  Place the sausage meat in a small frying pan
  or wok. Cook over low heat until thoroughly cooked and the fat is
  rendered, about 15 minutes.  Stir occasionally. Transfer to a sieve
  and press the meat with the back of a spoon to eliminate all fat. If
  the sausage meat is still in lumps, chop finely. Soak the rice sticks
  in hot water for 20 minutes. Drain and cut into 2-inch lengths. Soak
  the mushrooms in hot water until soft, about 20 minutes.  Discard the
  stems and shred the caps. Combine the sausage, mushrooms, rice
  sticks, cabbage, bean sprouts, carrots, and green onions. Separately
  combine the sherry, oyster sauce, sesame oil, chili sauce, sugar, and
  garlic.  Combine the cornstarch with an equal amount of cold water
  and set aside. Place a 12-inch skillet or wok over high heat. When
  hot, add 2 tablespoons cooking oil; when the oil becomes hot, add the
  sausage mixture.  Stir-fry until the vegetables are brightly colored,
  about 2 minutes, then add the sauce. Stir-fry until the vegetables
  just begin to wilt, about 1 minute more.  Add a little of the
  cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce, then transfer to a bowl.
  Cool to room temperature, and then place in the freezer until
  thoroughly chilled, about 1 hour. Separate the spring roll skins.
  Position each spring roll so one of the corners is pointing at you.
  Place about 1/2 cup of the filling in the bottom third of the skin
  and then form the filling into a cylinder, stretching between the
  side corners. Bring the corner nearest you over the center of the
  filling and then tuck the tip under the filling. Roll the spring roll
  a turn. Brush the two side corners one-third over the top of the
  cylinder. Now finish rolling the spring roll into a cylinder. Place
  on a small tray as you complete the rest of the spring rolls. Store,
  unstacked and uncovered, in the refrigerator. (These can be done a
  day ahead.) LAST-MINUTE COOKING: Place 3 cups of cooking oil in a
  12-inch skillet and heat over high heat. When the oil reaches 370 F
  (bubbles will escape from the end of a wooden spoon when placed into
  the oil for 10 seconds), fry the spring rolls in 3 batches, cooking
  them on both sides until light golden, about 3 minutes. Drain on a
  wire rack. Heat the oil again, this time until it reaches 400 F. Fry
  the spring rolls a second time in 2 batches until they are dark
  golden, about 1 minute. Drain. The second frying makes the spring
  rolls crispier. Serve spring rolls whole or cut in half, with one or
  more dipping sauces. Guest should wrap a spring roll in a lettuce
  leaf, dip it in sauce, and enjoy. Serves: 8 to 12 as an appetizer

  blender, or work it in with fingertips until lumps are no larger than
  small peas. 3. Stir in buttermilk ( or cream) and let stand for 2-3
  min. dough is very wet. 4. Pour remaining 1 cup all-purpose flour
  onto a plate. Flour hands well. Scoop up about 2 Tbsp. dough and
  scrape it onto the flour. Sprinkle more flour onto the dough. Gently
  pick up clump of dough and shape into a soft round by passing it from

  Crunchy vegetable kebabs make an eye-catching main course, and the
  final coating of melting mozzarella is quite mouthwatering. Serve
  them on a bed of rice, with a sauce of your choice (see Sauces).
  
  Slice all the vegetables to bite size and skewer them alternately on
  to kebab sticks. Brush liberally with olive oil and sprinkle with
  dried mixed herbs, salt and pepper. Grill under a moderate heat for
  10-12 minutes, turning, until the vegetables are cooked through but
  still slightly crisp. Then finally cover them with slices of
  mozzarella and brown under the grill. Serve at once.

  To make the pastry, rub 2 oz of the lard into the flour mixed with a
  teaspoon of salt until it is the consistency of breadcrumbs. 4. Boil
  the rest of the fat with the milk and water. 5. Make a well in the
  mound of flour and while stirring with a wooden spoon, mix in the
  boiling liquid. 6. Knead and leave to rest for 10 minutes. 7. To make
  the casing or "coffyn", roll out three-quarters of the dough into a
  circle 3/4" thick. Flour the outside of the tin and stand it in the
  centre of the dough. Work the dough up the sides of the tin and then
  gently remove the tin leaving you with a pie casing. 8. Fill it
  immediately with the meat mixture as it is likely to collapse. 9.
  Roll out the remaining dough into a circle slightly larger than the
  diameter of the casing, to form the lid. 10. Preheat the oven to 400F
  11. Dampen the top edge of the pie and gently press on the lid.
  Crimp the edge. Make a hole in the centre of the lid and decorate it
  with pastry leaves. 12. Place on a baking dish and bake in the
  preheated oven for 20 minutes and then reduce the heat to 300 degrees
  F and bake for 1 3/4 hours. If necessary place some aluminim foil on
  the top to prevent burning. 13. Remove from the oven and allow to
  cool completely.  Pour the chilled stock through the hole in the lid
  and refrigerate Serve Cold.

      Title: MELVIN LAROCQUE'S BANNOCK V2.0
 Categories: Quickbreads, Canadian, Jw, Native, Tnt
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  All purpose flour
    3/4 ts Salt
      2 tb [Scant] baking powder
    1/2 c  Lard; melted *
  1 1/4 c  Or more water; divided
    1/2 c  Raisins, currants or dried
           -blueberries or cranberries
           -[optional]
      2 tb Sugar [if fruit added]
 
  Bannock, a simple type of scone, originated in Scotland and was made
  originally of oatmeal. The first pioneers taught it to the Indians
  who did not previously have leavened breads and made unleavened
  breads from corn and nut meals, which were a very minor part of their
  diet [breads not corn and nuts]. It has spread and adapted from
  there, with many regional variations.
  
  It was cooked in pioneer days in cast iron frying pans over open
  fires. Toutons use a similar dough where small rings are deep fried
  like doughnuts. Variations in flours and the additional of dried or
  fresh fruit make this bread a popular choice of hunters and campers
  today. Oven baking has become an alternative to the cast iron frying
  pan when made at home. The dough can also be wrapped around green
  de-barked sticks driven into the ground beside the camp fire.
  
  * Melted shortening, butter or margarine can be used but the taste
  will be altered. Lard is traditional.
  
  Measure flour, salt, baking powder [and dried fruit and sugar] into a
  large bowl. Stir to mix. Make a well in the center and pour in a 1/2
  cup water. Do not mix yet. Then add the melted lard and the rest of
  the water. Depending on the dryness of the flour add up to 1/4 cup 
  more. The resulting batter should be slightly sticky, not flaky like
  pie pastry. Stir with fork to make a ball. No not overmix; stop as
  soon as the ball of dough lifts away from the bowl. Turn out onto a
  working surface. Knead gently about 10 times. Do not over work the
  dough and let the gluten develop. Or mix and knead with your hands in
  the bowl. Pat into a flat circle 1 inch thick. Cook in a greased
  frying pan over medium heat allowing 15 minutes each side. Use two
  lifters for easy turning. Serve hot with butter. Break it off in
  chunks or slice into wedges with a knife. May also be baked on
  greased baking sheet at 375 deg for 25 to 30 minutes or 450 deg for
  about 20 minutes for a golden brown exterior and a soft moist
  interior. The bannock will brown easier with the addition of at least
  some of the optional sugar.
  
  This tastes best in a frying pan outdoors over a wood fire.
  
  Variations: Substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour and/or 1/2 cup oatmeal
  for up to 1 1/2 cups of white flour.
  
  Add fresh fruit instead of dried.
  
  Add aged shredded Cheddar cheese and/or chopped onion, garlic, herbs
  etc.

  From Blue Ribbon Cook Book, Winnipeg Manitoba 1905 - Mince Pie Hints
  Dried apples soaked in water a few hours make a very fair substitute
  for fresh apples in mince pies. Dried cherries and other fruit
  prepared with sugar can be soaked 10-12 hours in a very little water
  and then both water and fruit used instead of raisins. They will be
  much cheaper and will answer very well.  Economical housewives will
  often find hints like these very serviceable.

      2 ts Onion powder
      2 ts Black pepper
      2 ts White pepper
      1 ts Cayenne
      2 c  Apple cider vinegar
 
  I make something that I call Memphis in May Dry Rub. It is made with
  4 tsp paprika, 2 tps salt, 2 tsp onion powder, 2 tsp Black pepper, 2
  tsp white pepper and 1 tsp cayenne pepper. You mix this up in a jar,
  closed the lid, and shake well to mix. I then put this in a bottle
  and added 2 cups of apple cider vinegar, gave it a good shaking and
  BINGO its almost there. A little too hot and I need to cut back a
  little on the pepper (at least on the cayenne).  Maybe cut the black
  pepper back to 1 1/2 tsp, the White to 1 tsp and>> the cayenne to 1/4
  or 1/2 tsp. Like I said this ain't exactly it, but by golly it's damn
  close. If you like you may want to add a little garlic powder and/or
  some dry mustard. Maybe even a little ground cumin. Just thought I
  would pass this along to all you COLD weather cookers and smokers out
  there who only get to cookout about half the year. (Yes, Ed, I do
  include you, up there in Connecticut, in these numbers.)

      1 c  White vinegar
      1 c  Tomato sauce
    1/4 c  Worcestershire sauce

    1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
    1/8 ts Cayenne
        ds Tabasco sauce
 
  The center of mid-South barbecue, Memphis offers a range of sauces
  that take the high middle ground between Eastern and Western styles.
  Like this version, they are often medium-bodied mixtures, moderate in
  sweet, heat, and everything else except taste.
  
  In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and
  saute for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the onions begin to turn golden.
  Stir in the remaining ingredients, reduce the heat to low, and cook
  until the mixture thickens, approximately 20 minutes. Stir frequently.
  
  Use the sauce warm. It keeps, refrigerated, for a couple of weeks.

 Categories: Sauces, Bar-b-q
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------MEMPHIS STYLE METHOD-------------------------
           --Weber--
 
  :       Memphis Style refers to the John Wills method and recipe of
  John Wills Bar-B-Que Pit, in east Memphis Tennessee. John and his
  family have provided pork ribs "crunchy brown on the outside and lean
  white in the middle with a sweet and tangy sauce." Step #1: The
  Memphis starts with rubbing a spicy dry marinade into the meat before
  cooking.
   Step #2: Tending the ribs on a long, low, smokey fire, of white oak
  or hickory. Basting with a second marinade, turning often on a
  horizontal rack, every half hour or so. Cook over a (225F) degree,
  smokey fire. Cooking could take 5 to 9 hours depending on the size of
  the cooker etc. Stop using the basting sauce about an hour before
  serving.
   Step #3: Warm the Memphis sweet sauce and either brush it on during
  the last 20 minutes of cooking or serve it on the side.
   Weber Method;
    See #1 above and then. cook on low indirect fire on a large weber
  kettle with chunk style charcoal. Use a water filled drip pan under
  the ribs, a boiling pot of water over the coals. Stand the ribs up on
  edge in a vertical rack, and try to cook the ribs on a calm day,
  (wind under 10mph).
   Cook 5 to 7 hours basting often (every half hour), with the basting
  sauce, STOP using the basting sauce about an hour before serving.
   See step #3 above for sweet sauce tips.

      1    Neem leaf; crushed or Bay
 
  :       Combine ingredients in a large heavy weight Dutch oven. Bring
  to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  :       I like to serve this sauce at the table and not baste the
  ribs with it while they are on the grill. If you paint this sauce on
  while the ribs are hot but off from the fire they will glaze and very
  slightly brown.
   Baste the ribs with this marinade only during the last half hour of
  cooking, to glaze the ribs and make them slightly brown...
   If this sauce is put on the ribs too early the sugar will blacken the
  outside of the ribs and be unpleasant looking but not bad tasting....
   The goal is NOT to blacken the outside of the ribs at all, so I
  usually serve the sauce at the table near the ribs..... Enjoy this
  sauce.

 Categories: Turkish, Eggs, Breakfast
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Onion
      4    Tomatoes
      4    Green hot peppers
      5 tb Butter
      8    Eggs
           Salt
           Pepper
      1 ts Mild paprika powder
 
  Chop the onion finely. Cut a cross in the top of the tomatoes and put
  them in hot water. Remove the skins. Cut the tomatoes into small
  pieces. Wash the peppers and cut them into very small rings. Heat the
  butter in a big skillet. Sautee the onion until soft, then add
  peppers and tomatoes and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes. Beat the
  eggs with salt and pepper and paprika powder. Pour mixture over
  vegetables. Keep stirring with a fork until set. (Serve on nice fresh
  homemade or -of course- Turkish bread)
  
  Be careful with the peppers. Peppers used here are the Turkish kind, a
  cross between parika's and hot peppers. Remove the seeds to make them
  less hot.

      4 lg Egg whites
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
      1 tb Cornstarch -- sifted
      1 ts Cornstarch -- sifted
    1/2 ts White vinegar -- distilled
 
  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Trace 8 3 1/4-inch circles on
  each; turn over. Lightly brush parchment with butter and dust with
  flour. Tap off excess. In a food processor, process 5 1/2 tablespoons
  sugar and almonds to a fine powder. Heat oven to 225 F. In electric
  mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until
  foamy, about 5 minutes. Increase speed to medium high; slowly add
  remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Beat until glossy and firm, 5 minutes.
  Reduce speed to low, sprinkle cornstarch over, and mix 15 to 20
  seconds. Add vinegar; mix 15 to 20 seconds more. Fold in almond
  mixture with a rubber spatula. Spread 1/4 cup of the mixture onto
  each circle on parchment. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes, rotating pans
  between shelves and reversing positions halfway through. Transfer
  meringues, on parchment, to racks to cool.

      Title: MERINGUE FOR PIES
 Categories: Pies, Pastry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Egg whites
      1 ts Cream of tartar
      1 pn Salt
      6 tb Sugar
 
  Beat the egg whites till they form soft peaks.  Add the cream of
  tartar and salt and continue beating till the whites are stiff but
  not dry. Add sugar, a little at a time, beating it in well. Spread
  the meringue over the pie, being certain to cover the surface
  completely, including the edge of the crust. If you are deft with the
  pastry tube, you may pipe the meringue over the pie, using a #6
  rosette tube. Bake the meringue at 350 degrees 15 to 18 minutes, or
  until it is lightly browned. Note: The secret to keeping the meringue
  from shrinking is to make sure there are no gaps between the pie
  crust and the meringue.

      Title: MERINGUE FRUIT TORTE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           MERINGUE
      2    Egg whites at room temp.
    1/2 ts White vinegar
        pn Salt
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
           LEMON SAUCE
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
      2 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Grated lemon peel
    1/3 c  Water
    1/3 c  Fresh lemon juice
      1    Egg, beaten
      2 c  Cut-up fresh fruit
           Garnish:  Mint leaves
 
  To make meringue:  In bowl, combine egg whites, vinegar, and salt.
  Beat until soft peaks form.  Add sugar, 1 tbsp (15 ml) at a time;
  beat until stiff peaks form.
  
  Line a baking sheet with parchment or brown paper (aluminum foil may
  also be used).  Draw a circle with an 8-inch diameter. Spoon
  egg-white mixture on paper pattern; with a spoon shape mixture into a
  circle with sides about 2 inches higher than centre.  Or prepare
  individual meringues 2 inches in diameter.
  
  Bake single meringue in 250F oven for about 1 1/2 hours or until
  slightly coloured.  Turn off oven and leave meringue to cool for 2
  hours or overnight before removing from oven. Carefully remove from
  paper. (Bake individual meringue for 50 to 60 minutes).
  
  To make lemon sauce:  In small saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch,
  and lemon peel.  Stir in water and lemon juice; cook over medium
  heat, stirring constantly until slightly thickened.  Carefully stir
  one-quarter of hot mixture into beaten egg to prevent egg from
  coagulating; return to hot mixture, stirring constantly. Cook and
  stir for 4 minutes or until thickened.  Cover and refrigerate.
  
  Just before serving, combine cut-up fruit with lemon sauce. Spoon into
  meringue shell and serve, garnished with mint leaves.
  
  Preparation 1 hour, Cook 1 1/2 hour.  6 servings 192 Calories per

  My Note:  Lemon sauce can be made with two egg yolks if you are
  unconcerned about cholesterol.  Check the meringue at about 40
  minutes - tastes good without the extra drying time for eating the
  same day.

      1 ts Or more flavorings**
 
  *Set a measuring cup in hot water & add glucose. Stir until warm and
  thin. Add as directed above. **Add almond extract and <clear> vanilla
  to taste. Add this only at the end, to prevent icing from breaking
  down. Don't add butter flavor, may contain fat! Using "fine" sugar &
  salt is not necassary as long as you aren't going to press the icing
  through very fine decorating tips <#1,0,00, or 000>. I use regular.
  This icing is like the insides of marshmallows without the coating.
  It is the same as 7-minute icing without the cooking time. ***Be sure
  all utensils used are grease-free. Any bit of grease will break the
  icing down to soup.
   Very good-tasting. Great to use this type when adding coconut
  because it never crusts. Great to decorate with. Makes wonderful
  flowers, but remember, they don't crust. I have made flowers with it
  & they would crust ~ after a few weeks, but every time it rained,
  they got sticky again. This icing is the type used by professionals
  who do lots of big figure-piped characters, since it is sooo smooth &
  especially since it is sooo light-weight. Dolores McCann, Oxford OH
