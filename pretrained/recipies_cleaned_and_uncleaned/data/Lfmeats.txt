1. Coarsely chop 4 potatoes. Place chopped and whole potatoes, beef, onions, garlic, mushrooms, tomatoes, beef stock, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, oregano and mustard in pressure cooker. Stir well to blend, making sure that some of the liquid has seeped down to the bottom. Lock the lid in place and, over high heat, bring to high pressure.

2. Adjust heat to maintain high pressure; cook for 16 minutes. Let pressure drop naturally about 10 minutes. Do not use a quick-release method. Remove lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. Test beef for doneness. If it is not sufficiently tender, lock lid back into place and return to high pressure a few more minutes. Let pressure drop naturally.

3. Stir in the green beans and parsley. Add salt and pepper to taste, and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until green beans are cooked, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove bay leaves and adjust seasonings.

   1      teaspoon      canola oil
   3                    jalapeno peppers
                        --seeded and minced

   1      cup           fresh orange juice
     1/2  cup           cider vinegar
     1/2  cup           molasses
                        salt & freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
                        ***PORK***
     1/4  cup           cumin seeds
   2      tablespoons   crushed black pepper
   1      tablespoon    kosher salt
   2                    pork tenderloins -- trimmed
                        --12-ounces each

TO MAKE GLAZE: In a small nonreactive saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add jalapenos and garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add orange juice and vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until reduced to 1/2 cup, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in molasses. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

TO MAKE PORK: 1. Prepare a grill for two-level cooking.

2. In a small dry skillet, heat cumin seeds over low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Place in a small bowl and stir in pepper and salt. Press cumin mixture into pork, coating all sides.

3. When grill is medium-hot, sear pork over hot side of grill until browned on all sides, about 12 minutes. Move to cooler side of grill, tent with aluminum foil and cook, turning occasionally, until pork is only slightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes; during last 3 minutes of cooking, brush with 1/3 cup of reserved glaze.

4. Transfer pork to a cutting board, tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut across the grain into 1-inch-thick slices. Serve, passing remaining glaze separately.

  12      ounces        dried lasagna noodles
                        --or 1 pound fresh lasagna noodles
   3      cups          low-fat milk
     1/3  cup           all-purpose white flour
   2      ounces        reduced-fat cream cheese
                        --3 tablespoons

                        --thawed and squeezed dry
     3/4  cups          low-fat 2% cottage cheese
   6      ounces        sweet italian-style turkey sausage
                        --removed from casing
   1      teaspoon      olive oil
   1                    onion -- sliced
   2      cloves        garlic -- minced
   1      teaspoon      dried marjoram or oregano
     1/2  teaspoon      fennel seeds
   7      ounces        roasted red peppers -- drained and chopped
                        --about 3/4 cup
     1/2  cup           dry white wine
     1/2  cup           grated part-skim mozzarella cheese
   1      tablespoon    chopped fresh parsley

1. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles until barely tender (8 minutes for dried, 1 minute for fresh). Drain and rinse under cold water. Spread the noodles on clean kitchen towels, cover with plastic wrap and set aside.

2. In a large saucepan, heat 2 1/2 cups of the milk over medium heat until steaming. Meanwhile, put flour in a small bowl and gradually whisk in the remaining 1/2 cup milk until smooth; whisk into the hot milk and stir constantly over the heat until the sauce comes to a simmer and thickens. Continue cooking and stirring for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Whisk in cream cheese, then Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and nutmeg. Set the cheese sauce aside.

3. In a bowl, stir together spinach and cottage cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

4. In a large nonstick skillet, cook sausage over medium-high heat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until it is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and chop fine. Set aside.

5. Wipe the skillet clean and add oil. Return the pan to the heat, add onions and cook, stirring, until well-browned, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, marjoram or oregano, and fennel seeds and cook for 1 minute longer. Stir in peppers, wine and the cooked sausage and simmer until the wine has nearly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.

6. Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly oil a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or coat it with nonstick cooking spray.

7. Smear the bottom of the prepared dish with 1/2 cup of the cheese sauce. Line the bottom with a single layer of noodles. Spread half of the spinach mixture over the noodles. Spoon on another 1/2 cup of sauce and use a rubber spatula to spread it evenly. Add another layer of noodles, top with all of the sausage mixture and another 1/2 cup sauce. Add a third layer of noodles, the remaining spinach mixture and another 1/2 cup sauce. Finish with the remaining noodles and sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella.

8. Lightly oil a large piece of aluminum foil or coat it with nonstick cooking spray, and use it to tightly cover the dish. Bake the lasagna for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for about 15 minutes more, or until lightly browned and bubbling. Let stand for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

Makes 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***FILLING***
     1/4  cup           bulgur
   1      cup           hot water
     1/2  pound         lean ground lamb
   1      teaspoon      olive oil
   1      small         onion -- finely chopped
   1      clove         garlic -- minced
     1/3  cup           reduced-sodium chicken broth -- defatted
   2      tablespoons   golden raisins -- chopped
   2      tablespoons   chopped fresh mint
   1      tablespoon    fresh lemon juice
   1      tablespoon    tomato paste
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
                        --plus more to taste
     1/4  teaspoon      freshly ground black pepper
                        --plus more to taste
     1/4  teaspoon      freshly grated nutmeg
     1/4  teaspoon      ground cinnamon
                        ***PASTRY***
   3      tablespoons   olive oil
  12      sheets        phyllo dough -- thawed
   1 1/2  teaspoons     sesame seeds

TO MAKE FILLING: 1. In a bowl, combine bulgur and water. Set aside to soften, about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside. 2. In a large nonstick skillet, cook lamb over medium-high heat, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer lamb to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Wipe out skillet. 3. Heat oil in the skillet over low heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until onion is softened and golden, 5 to 7 minutes. (Add 1 tablespoon water if onion gets too dry.) Add lamb, reserved bulgur, chicken broth, raisins, mint, lemon juice, tomato paste, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, nutmeg and cinnamon. Return to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until liquid has been absorbed, 5 to 10 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Let cool.

TO PREPARE PASTRY & FORM TRIANGLES: 1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat it with nonstick spray. 2. Put oil in a small bowl. Dampen a pastry brush with water, shaking off excess. 3. Lay 1 sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side closest to you. Brush lightly with oil and place another sheet of phyllo on top. Lightly brush with more oil. Cut phyllo lengthwise into 4 strips. Place 1 tablespoon lamb mixture at the bottom of each strip and fold one comer of the strip diagonally over the filling to the opposite edge, forming a triangle. Continue folding the filling up in the pastry, as you would a flag. Place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining phyllo and filling to form 24 triangles in all. 4. Brush tops of triangles lightly with remaining oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds. (The triangles can be formed, frozen on a baking sheet, then transferred to plastic storage bags. They will keep, frozen, for up to 1 month. Do not thaw before baking.) 5. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until triangles are golden brown and crisp. Let cool slightly before serving.

MAKES 2 DOZEN TRIANGLES.
