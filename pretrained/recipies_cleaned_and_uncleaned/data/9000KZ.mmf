      Title: NEW YORK-STYLE BAGELS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 18 Bagels
 
      1    Potato, peeled and quartered
      2 c  Boiling water
      1    Package active dry yeast
      4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 tb Salt
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      2 lg Eggs
           Cornmeal to dust cookie
           -sheet
      2 qt Water
      1    Egg white (optional)
 
  Directions:
  
  Put potato into boiling water and boil for 15 minutes. Discard potato
  and let water cool to about 110 degrees F.
  
  Transfer 1/3 cup of the potato water to a small bowl. Sprinkle yeast
  over top of water and stir to combine. Set aside for 3 minutes.
  
  Sift flour, salt, and 1/2 tablespoon of the sugar together into a
  large bowl.  Add yeast mixture.  Stir in another 2/3 cup of the
  potato water and the oil. Add eggs one at a time and stir briskly
  until a dough ball is formed.
  
  Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about ten minutes
  until dough ball is firm, adding a little extra flour if needed.
  Place in a greased bowl, turning the dough so all sides are greased.
  Cover the bowl with a clean towel and set aside in a warm place for
  about 1 hour until dough has risen to double its original size. Punch
  the risen dough down to flatten and remove from bowl.
  
  Cut dough into 18 equal pieces and shape each piece into a 6- to
  7-inch-long, 3/4-inch-thick rope.  Bring the ends of one rope
  together and pinch closed.  (A little water on the ends will help
  secure them.) Repeat until 18 rings are formed.  Cover all rings with
  the towel and let rise for 20 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Lightly grease a cookie sheet and
  dust with cornmeal.
  
  Bring the 2 quarts water to a boil.  Add the remaining tablespoon of
  sugar to the boiling water.  Drop the bagels into the water one at a
  time, cooking each for 3 minutes, turning once. As each bagel is
  removed from the water, place it on the cookie sheet.  If desired,
  paint the tops of the bagels with 1 egg white that has been beaten
  with 1 teaspoon water. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown.

 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Boneless leg of lamb
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Oil
    1/2 c  White wine
      1 ts Crushed garlic
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Dried rosemary
      1 ts Pepper
      1 tb Red pepper flakes
 
  Marinate in the fridge for a good long while.  A week isn't too long.
  Grill in a Webber kettle with the lid on and the vents almost closed,
  15-20 minutes on each side.
  
  A leg of lamb is great for a crowd.  Because the thickness is quite
  uneven, some parts will be well done while others are medium rare.
  Who says you can't please all the people all the time!

      Title: NEW ZEALAND SALMON IN JELLY
 Categories: Fish, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 lb Fresh Salmon
      6 tb Butter
      3    Lemons
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Clean salmon and remove head, tail and fins. Cut the salmon into 1 lb
  steaks (not fillets). Place 1 salmon steak onto a sheet of foil,
  squeeze the juice of 1/2 a lemon, spread 1 tb of butter plus salt and
  pepper on the salmon. Wrap the salmon steak tightly in the foil
  (heavy duty) so as to make the best water tight seal as possible.
  Repeat for each steak. Boil the packages in water for 20 minutes.
  Remove and place in the freezer for an hour then refrigerate for 2
  hours. When ready to serve, unwrap the salmon steaks carefully on a
  large platter and cover with warm Hollandaise Sauce. To accompany the
  salmon, this dish should be served with new baby potatoes which have
  been boiled with mint leaves, and fresh garden peas, plus a palatable
  white wine. This is a very basic but absolutely delicious recipe. Of
  course, the fun is catching the salmon and telling the story of how
  the large one snapped the rod like a pretzel and "got away"!

      2 tb Vegetable oil
      2 lg Onions; sliced thin
      2 c  Cooked red beans*
    1/4 c  Bean cooking liquid or water
      1 c  Cooked white rice*
 
  *NOTES: Beans: Place 1 c of dry red beans, 6 mashed garlic cloves and
  enough water to cover in a pressure cooker and cook for 15 to 20
  minutes. Do not add salt as it will toughen beans. Rice: Converted
  rice works best. It can be made in the rice cooker if you prefer, but
  watch the water rice ratio and cooking time; the rice needs to be
  firm, not sticky.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pot and saute onion until lightly golden. Add
  the cooked beans and liquid, Stir gently and continuously over low
  heat for about 5 minutes; the beans should remain whole not mashed.
  Add the cooked rice and continue to stir for about 10 minutes. Taste
  and add a little salt if desired.

  3 1/2 lb Peaches; peeled and sliced
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
    1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg

      Title: NICKY'S FAVOURITE SHORTBREAD
 Categories: Christmas, Cookies
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 c  Unsalted butter (room temp.)
    1/2 c  Icing sugar
      2 c  All purpose flour*
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
           Slivers of glaced cherries
 
  * 1 3/4 c if measured before sifting
  
  Cream butter and sugar together until silky.  Add sifted dry
  ingredients and mix until blended, but just. Turn out on a lightly
  floured pastry cloth, & with lightly floured hands, gather into one
  lump. (This may appear sloppy & maybe hopeless.  As in pastry, you
  will go wrong if you are too heavy handed or afraid of it!) Toss it
  just a bit to get it to lump and pat out into a square about 1/3 inch
  thick; square off your edges with a large knife or spatula, smooth
  with a stocking rolling pin and cut into 1 inch squares. Place
  slightly apart on ungreased cookie sheet with a sliver of cherry on
  each.  Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes. They should be just
  pale brown on bottom. WATCH IT, THEY BURN VERY EASILY. Remove gently
  please, they are still having birth pangs; place to cool on trays
  covered with waxed paper. Store in cans, they keep for weeks in a
  cool place, and their flavour mellows.

      Title: NIER BEURRE (CHANNEL ISLANDS FRUIT BUTTER)
 Categories: Fruits, Spreads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Dessert apples
      1 lb Cooking apples
           Granulated sugar
      2 pt Dry cider
    1/2    Orange
    1/2    Lemon
           Ground cinnamon & allspice
 
  Fast boil the cider until reduced by half.  Peel, core and slice HALF
  of each sort of apple; add them to the pan, pushing them well down
  into the liquid. Half-cover the pan and simmer gently until the fruit
  is soft.
  
      Add the remaining apples, prepared in the same way, together with
  the juice and zest of the citrus fruits. Half-cover the pan and
  continue simmering until all the fruit is well reduced, pulpy and
  tender. Stir occasionally and crush the fruit down into the pan with
  a potato masher as it cooks.  Measure the pulp and process it to a
  puree if it is at all lumpy. Add sugar at the rate of 10 oz for every
  pint of apple pulp, and stir in about 1 teaspoon ground allspice.
  
      Simmer, stirring frequently, until most of the moisture has been
  driven off.  The readiness of a fruit butter is judged by its
  consistency, not by set or temperature. It is ready when it is nearly
  dry - a spoon drawn across the mixture should leave its own
  impression. Pot in small, clean, warm jars and store in a very cold
  larder or fridge. Once jar is opened, the contents should be eaten up
  within 3 or 4 days. Makes enough to fill 4 or 5 small jars.

 Categories: Vegetables, Italian, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lg Eggplant
           Oil
    1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese, thinly
           -sliced
      2 c  Italian Tomato Sauce
    3/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Wash eggplant; do not peel.  Trim ends and cut eggplant crosswise into
  rounds 1/4" thick.  Place on broiler pan or baking sheet, brush
  surface with oil, and broil about 3" from heat 5 min, until lightly
  browned. Turn, brush uncooked side with oil, and broil 3 min on other
  side. Place single layer of cooked eggplant slices on bottom of 2 qt.
  baking dish (A deep casserole produces a thicker, creamier,
  multilayered dish; a shallow casserole gives fewer layers and a
  crustier top. Take your pick.) Cover with single layer of mozzarella
  cheese, spoon over enough sauce to cover, and sprinkle generously
  with grated Parmesan. Repeat layers until all eggplant is used,
  adding the Parmesan cheese layer every other time. End with tomato
  sauce and Parmesan cheese. Any extra sauce can be poured over top

 Categories: Ethiopia, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Butter
      4 tb Chopped onion
  1 1/2 tb Finely chopped garlic
      2 ts Fresh grated ginger
    1/2 ts Turmeric
      2    To 4 crushed cardamom seeds

  Niter Kebbeh is a spiced up ghee.  Here is a recipe for it from "The
  Africa News Cookbook", published in the US by Viking Penguin.
  
  Slowly melt butter in a saucepan, then bring to boil. When the top is
  covered with foam, add the other ingredients and simmer uncovered on
  lowest heat until the surface is transparent and milk solids are on
  the bottom (45 to 60 minutes).  Pour off the clear liquid and strain
  through a double layer of damp cheesecloth, discarding the spices and
  solids. Refrigerate. If strained a second and third time, the mixture
  will keep either chilled or at room temperature for 2 to 3 months.

      Title: NITER KEBBEH (SPICED BUTTER OIL)
 Categories: Africa, Ethiopia, Salads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Butter, unsalted; cut into
           -small pieces
      1    Onion, small; chopped coars
           -ely
      3 tb Garlic cloves; chopped fine
      4 ts Ginger root; chopped fine
  1 1/2 ts Turmeric
      1    Cardamon pod
      1    Cinnamon stick; 1"
      1    Cloves, whole
    1/8 ts Nutmeg, ground
 
  1. In a heavy 5 quart saucepan, heat the butter over moderate heat,
  turning it about with a spoon to melt it slowly and completely
  without letting it brown. Then increase the heat and bring the butter
  to a boil. When the surface is completely covered with white foam,
  stir in the onion, garlic, ginger, turmeric, cardamon, cinnamon,
  clove and nutmeg. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible point and
  simmer uncovered and undisturbed for 45 minutes, or until the milk
  solids on the bottom of the pan are a golden brown and the butter on
  top is transparent.
  
  2. Slowly pour the clear liquid niter kebbeh into a bowl, straining it
  through a fine sieve lined with a linen towel or four layers of
  dampened cheesecloth. Discard the seasonings. If there are any solids
  left in the kebbeh, strain it again to prevent it from becoming
  rancid later.
  
  3. Pour the kebbeh into a jar, cover tightly, and store in the
  refrigerator or at room temperature until ready to use. Kebbeh will
  solidify when chilled. It can safely be kept, even at room
  temperature, for 2 or
        3    months.

      Title: NITER KEBBEH (SPICED CLARIFIED BUTTER)
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Chopped onions
      2    Cloves garlic, pressed
      2 ts Fresh gingerroot, grated
    1/2 ts Turmeric
      4    Cardamom seeds, crushed
      1    Cinnamon stick
      2    Cloves
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 ts Ground fenugreek seeds
      1 tb Fresh basil
           - or 1 teaspoon dried basil
 
  In a small saucepan, gradually melt the butter and bring it to
  bubbling. When the top is covered with foam, add the other
  ingredients and reduce the heat to a simmer. Gently simmer,
  uncovered, on low heat. After about 45 to 60 minutes, when the
  surface becomes transparent and the milk solids are on the bottom,
  pour the liquid through a cheesecloth into a heat resistant
  container.  Discard the spices and solids.
  
  Covered tightly and stored in the refrigerator, Niter Kebbeh will
  keep for up to 2 months.
  
  Comment from the book:  Niter Kebbeh has been prized in Ethiopia as a
  cooking oil and a seasoning for a very long time. Without careful
  packaging and proper refrigeration, butter easily spoils.
  Furthermore, because of the milk solids it contains, butter has a low
  scorching temperature, which limits its usefulness in cooking.
  However, the milk solids can be removed from butter by the process of
  clarifying it. Clarified butter keeps well, even at room temperature.
  Niter Kebbeh adds flavor to North African foods and is a must in
  Ethiopian cooking.

  Combine all ingredents except crushed cookies.  (I leave my fruit and

  all the fruit and nuts in the milk. Gradually add the crushed cookies
  to the mixture and stir.  As soon as the mixture is not "real" sticky
  you will know you have enough crushed cookies mixed in. Butter your
  loaf or ring pan very well and spoon in the fruit cake mixture. Press
  down firmly with the back of a greased spoon (I just grease my
  "clean" hands and push the mixture down to pack it well.) Cover with
  plastic wrap or foil and place in the refridg. for at least 2 days.
  When ready to serve, remove from refridg. and tip out on a serving

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground beef
    1/2 lb Sweet Italian sausage,
           -removed from its casing and
           -broken into small chunks
      5 c  Basic tomato sauce
     12 oz Frozen chopped spinach
     24 oz Ricotta cheese
      2 lg Eggs
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesian
      1 tb Salt
           Olive oil, or butter, for
           -greasing the baking pan
      1 lb Lasagna noodles
      1 lb Mozzarella, thinly sliced
           -or grated
 
  EQUIPMENT
  
  large frying pan - colander - medium saucepan - 9" x 13" baking pan -
  2 large bowls - aluminum foil
  
  METHOD
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.
  
  Place large frying pan on high heat and let it get very hot, about 45
  seconds.  Add ground beef and sausage and brown, stirring frequently,
  until meat is cooked through. Transfer meat to a colander and let fat
  drain. Then transfer to a large bowl, add the tomato sauce and stir
  to combine. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the
  spinach in enough boiling water to cover, until cooked through about
  5 minutes. (The spinach can also be cooked in the microwave.)
  Transfer to a colander and rinse with cold water.  Squeeze small
  clumps of spinach between your hands until the water is thoroughly
  extracted. Transfer spinach to large bowl. Add ricotta, eggs, 1/4 cup
  parmesian, and mix well. Lightly oil or butter baking pan. Spoon in
  just enough meat sauce to cover the bottom. Cover sauce with a layer
  of pasta, laying strips lengthwise, side by side, and up to edges of
  pan. Cover pasta with 1/4 of remaining sauce and top with 1/2 the
  mozzarella. Cover mozarella with second layer of pasta and coat pasta
  with 1/3 of remaining sauce. Spread on all of ricotta-spinach mixture
  in a even layer and cover it with a third layer of pasta. Spread on
  1/2 of the remaining sauce and top with the remaining mozzarella.
  Arrange fourth layer of pasta and cover with final layer of sauce.
  Sprinkle on remaining 1/4 cup Parmesian.  Cover pan securely with
  foil and bake until cheese melts and noodles are cooked through,
  about 50 minutes. Remove lasagna from oven and let rest for 5 minutes
  before serving.

      Title: NO BURN BBQ CHICKEN
 Categories: Main dish, Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 ea Chicken thighs-boned
    1/8 ts Salt
      1 ea Onion, small-chopped
    1/8 ts Paprika
      2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
    1/8 ts Parsley
      1 ea Chicken bouillion cube, crus
    1/8 ts Red pepper ground or cayenne
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Sage
      1 x  Splash each vinegar and oil
 
  Skin and bone chicken thighs or use boned, skinless breasts. ( The
  butcher at my deli, does the thighs for me. He says it is easier to
  do if the meat is semi frozen.) Combine all ingredients in shallow
  bowl. Allow to marinate for at least 20 min. Gas Grill - Grill over
  high heat 5 minutes, turn, reduce heat to medium. Baste with leftover
  marinade. Grill 5 to 10 minutes more depending on thickness of meat.
  Charcoal Grill - Cook over glowing coals for ten minutes, turning and
  basting with the leftover marinade. Chicken is done when pierced with
  the tip of a knife blade, and the "juice" is clear.  The marinade
  gives it the flavor of a BBQ sauce with no sugary sauce to burn. Keep
  a spray bottle of water nearby in case of a flare up if your chicken
  is fatty.  Removing the skin, cuts out the added risk of flare ups
  and the chicken cube gives it richer flavor. Thanks to all who
  requested a repost! Linda JAX. FL  TWPK06B

      Title: NO FAIL LASAGNA
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    500 g  Oven Ready Lasagna Noodles
      4 tb Butter
      1 sm Onion diced
      3 tb Flour
      2 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Parmesan cheese
    3/4 ts Salt
      2    Egg yolks
      1 lb Lean ground beef
      6 c  Spagetti sauce
      8 oz Mozzerella cheese
      8 oz Ricotta OR cottage
 
  Prepare covering sauce using butter, flour and milk. Easy microwave
  method is to first melt butter, add diced onion and microwave on HI
  for 1 min. Stir in flour and add milk. Microwave at HI until mixture
  starts to boil and thicken. Stir occasionally to prevent lumping.
  Otherwise, use basic white sauce technique and saute onions in fry
  pan, adding later. Add parmesan cheese and salt and stir. In a
  separate bowl, beat egg yolks slightly and add a small amount of the
  sauce to the eggs. Stir and then pour into the sauce, stirring
  constantly. Set aside. Brown the ground beef until cooked and drain
  off the fat. Add to sauce (any prepared sauce is fine, slightly
  spiced works best) and set aside. NOTE: Any homemade spagetti sauce
  works here, and if it contains ground beef then omit the above

  Non-Stick buttered flavored cooking spray
  
  In a 1 quart saucepan, combine the apricots and raisins. Add water to
  cover. Simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes or until the fruit is
  soft.
  
  Drain and coarsely chop.  Transfer the fruit to a medium bowl. Stir
  in the pears, maple syrup, lemon juice, cinnamon and nutmeg. To keep
  dough from drying as you work, unroll it onto a counter and cover
  with a berely damp towel.  Peel off 1 sheet of phyllo and place it
  flat on a dry section of the counter.  Spray lightly with butter
  flavored non-stick spray. Top with a second sheet and brush very
  lightly with water. Repeat the process, coating alternate sheet with
  either spray or water, until all 8 sheets have been used. Spoon the
  pear mixture onto the dough, positioning it along the lower half of
  the long side of the rectangle and leaving a 1 inch border on the
  sides and bottom. Fold in the sides and coat lightly with the spray.
  
  Starting at the bottom, roll the strudel to enclose the filling. Coat
  a cookie sheet with the spray. Transfer the roll, seam side down, to
  the sheet. Brush the top lightly with water. Bake at 350 F for 30-35
  minutes, or until golden.  Serve warm or cold. To make slicing
  easier, use a serrated knife.  Serves 8.

 Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Salsa
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 14 1/2 oz Red Gold tomatoes
           L large onion
      3    Or 4 bannana peppers (not
           -hot!)
      1 lg Handful fresh cilantro OR
      2 tb Dry cilantro
    1/2    Clove of garlic
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Put into blender and blast until its chopped up real good. This makes
  about a pound of salsa.  In fact it fits into an empty Sams Choice
  Salsa jar just fine. She also sometimes puts green peppers into the
  recipe which doesn't make it hot either. This recipe satisfies my
  need for salsa, however, I like it hot sometimes myself.

      Yield: 1 Cheesecake
 
MMMMM-------------------------FOR CRUST------------------------------
     12    Graham cracker squares
           -(2 1/2"; 16 for 10" plate)
    1/3 c  Grape Nuts cereal
           -(1/2 cup for 10" plate)
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      1 tb Hazelnut, walnut or canola

      1 ts Unsalted butter, melted
           (2 t for 10" place)
    1/2 lg Egg white (1 tb for 10"
           -plate)
      2 tb Fruit juice or water, or as
           -needed (1 tb for 10" plate)

MMMMM------------------------FOR FILLING-----------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Non-fat vanilla yogurt
      1 cn Crushed pineapple,
           -unsweetened or in light
           -syrup (20 oz)
    3/4 c  Non-fat cottage cheese
    3/4 c  Low-fat cream cheese, at
           -room temperature
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 ts Pineapple extract
      3 tb Lemon juice
  3 1/2 ts Unflavored gelatin
 
  To make crust: Position rack in center of oven, and preheat oven to
  350'F. Crumble the graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor
  and process until crumbs form. Add the cereal, sugar, oil, butter,
  egg white and 1 teaspoon juice or water. Pulse until the crumbs are
  evenly moistened. Pinch a spoonful of crumbs together, and test
  whether they are moist enough to hold the print of your finger. If
  necessary, add a few more drops of juice or water and pulse once or
  twice. Turn the crumbs into an 8" springform pan or a 10" pie plate
  and use your hand or the back of a metal spoon to press an even layer
  around the sides of the pan. Spread the remaining crumbs evenly over
  the pan bottom. Top with a piece of wax paper, and press to form an
  even layer, taking care not to build up the crumbs in the corner.
  Bake the shell for 7 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before
  filling. The crust firms and crisps as it cools. To make filling:
  Place the yogurt in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl and set
  aside to drain for at least 20 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl, and
  discard the whey. Drain the crushed pineapple in a strainer set over
  a bowl. Press the fruit lightly with the back of a large spoon to
  release all the juice. Transfer the pineapple to a small bowl, and
  reserve 1/2 cup of the juice. Place the cottage cheese in a strainer
  set over a bowl. cover it with a piece of plastic wrap, and press
  down firmly on the cheese to force excess liquid from the curds.
  Place the cottage cheese and cream cheese in a blender or a food
  processor. Process for at least 3 minutes, or until absolutely
  smooth, with no trace of graininess, stopping once to scrape down the
  sides with a rubber spatula. Add the sugar, vanilla, pineapple
  extract and drained yogurt. Pulse until well blended. Scrape down the
  sides with a rubber spatula, and pulse several times. Add 1 1/2 cups
  of the drained crushed pineapple and pulse just to blend. In a small
  saucepan, combine the reserved 1/2 cup pineapple juice and the lemon
  juice. Sprinkle on the gelatin and allow to sit about 3 minutes to
  soften. Then stir the mixture over low heat just until the gelatin is
  dissolved; do not boil. With the blender or food processor running,
  add the gelatin mixture and pulse to blend. Pour the filling into the
  crust and refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight before serving.
  Once the top is firm, cover it with plastic wrap.

           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
  1 3/4 c  Granulated sugar, divided
  1 3/4 c  Egg whites (about 11), at
           -room temperature
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Cream of tartar
      2 ts Vanilla
 
  Fruit compote, optional (see accompanying recipes)
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  
  In a small bowl, combine flour and cocoa with 3/4 cup sugar. Mix well
  and set aside.
  
  Place egg whites in a large mixing bowl. Add salt and cream of
  tartar. Beat at high speed of an electric mixer until soft peaks
  form. Test by turning off machine and raising beater slowly.
  Gradually add the remaining sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, beating well
  after each addition. Continue beating until stiff peaks form when you
  remove the beaters.
  
  With a rubber spatula, gently fold in the vanilla. Then sprinkle a
  fourth of the flour mixture over the beaten egg whites. Using an
  under-and-over motion, gently fold in the flour with the spatula. Do
  5 strokes, rotating the bowl as you fold in the flour. Repeat three
  more times, until the flour mixture is all used up. Then fold an
  additional 10 strokes. Flour mixture should be blended into the egg
  whites.
  
  Gently pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake 35 to
  40 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. Invert tube pan
  over the neck of a glass bottle. Keep the cake inverted until
  completely cool, at least two hours.
  
  With a sharp knife, carefully loosen cake from the pan. Serve plain or
  garnished with a fruit compote.

  Help the children measure the peanut butter, corn syrup, dry powdered
  milk, and confectioners sugar into the large bowl. They can take
  turns stirring with the wooden spoon until everything is mixed and a
  stiff dough forms.
  
  Give everyone a paper plate and a pencil. Each child should write his
  or her name on the bottom of the plate. Make sure they hold their
  pencils correctly and use uppercase and lower case letters.
  
  Put a portion of dough on each plate. The children can shape it into
  bite-sized balls by pinching off pieces and rolling them between their
  hands.
  
  Smaller children who cannot make balls can make snakes. Then they can
  cut the snakes into segments (with an adults help) to make bite-sized
  pieces.
  
  Leave the peanut butter balls on the children's plates and
  refrigerate them until firm, about 1 hour.

      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      2    Packets active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm water (105-115f)
      2 ts Sugar
      2 c  Lukewarm water
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      6 c  Bread flour
    1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
 
  Place yeast in glass with 1/2 cup warm water.  Stir in sugar until
  yeast is disolved.  Let stand for 5 minutes, until foamy on top. Pour
  this mixture into a bowl and add 2 cups lukewarm water. Stir in salt.
  Add the 5 1/2 cups flour a cup at a time, mixing with a wooden spoon
  to blend after each addition.  Dough will be sticky.
  
  Spread 1/4 cup of the remaining flour on a work surface. Place dough
  on flour.  Place 1/4 cup flour on top of the dough.
  
  Begin kneading slowly until the flour  comes together with the rest
  of the dough.  Knead vigorously for 15 minutes. You may have to add
  several tablespoons of flour if the mixture is sticky.
  
  Use a sharp knife dipped in flour cut the dough into 16 equal
  portions. Roll each portion into a ball. Poke your thumbs through the
  center to make a hole about the size of a quarter.
  
  Spread 1/4 cup cornmeal on each of two trays or cutting boards and
  place 8 formed bagels on each about 1 inch apart. Cover with a clean
  dish towel and place in a warm draft free spot for 45 minutes to rise.
  
  Remove towel and place trays of bagels in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
  
  Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. Boil 3 cups water in a large pot.
  Spread 1/4 cup yellow cornmeal on 2 cookie sheets.
  
  Place bagels four at a time into the boiling water. The perfect bagel
  should sink to the bottom and rise immediatly. Boil about 4 minutes
  turning about every 30 seconds. Don't worry if your bagels don't sink
  to the bottom; however if they sink to the bottom and lie there, wait
  until they flost to the top before timing the 4 minutes.
  
  Remove bagels with a slotted spoon and place on a clean towel for a
  few seconds to drain excess water. Place 8 bagels on each cookie
  sheet.
  
  You can now add a favorite topping sesame, garlic or onion if
  desired. Bake 35 minutes or until golden. Remove bagels from cookie
  sheet and let them cool on a wire rack. From: Gary Fricke

  7 1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
      2 tb Active dry yeast
      1 tb Molasses; unsulphered
      4 c  Water; warm
 
  Recipe by: McDougall Plan Put flour in a large bowl. Place in a warm
  oven for 30 minutes to warm flour and bowl to 110 degrees (1 1/2
  minutes in microwave). Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water (110
  degrees). Add molasses and mix well. Let rest about 3 minutes. Then,
  add the yeast mixture and the remaining water (3 cups, warm). Mix
  well by stirring or use one hand to mix in bowl. Do no Knead. Dough
  will be sticky. Use non-stick pans or lightly oil two large loaf pan
  (9"x5"x3"). Sprinkle with cornmeal. Spoon dough mixture into pans.
  Smooth top with hand dampened with water to prevent sticking. Cover
  with towel. Place in a warm spot. Let rise about 1 hour or until
  dough reaches top of pans. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake for 20
  minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees. Bake 30-40 minutes longer.
  Remove pans from oven, tip pans on sides, and let cool on racks for
  15 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and continue to cool before
  storing. Bread is moist, so keep best in refrigerator.
  
  HELPFUL HINTS: Recipe may be doubled to make four loaves. Refrigerate
  or freeze extra loaves until ready to use. Other flours may be used
  in place of 1.5 cups whole wheat, such as brown rice flour, garbanzo
  flour, or barley flour. Use of nonstick pans is recommended. From the

 Categories: Digest, Nov., Abm
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Yeast
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
      3 tb Whole wheat flour
      3 c  White bread flour
  1 1/4 c  Warm water
      2 tb Applesauce
 
  put bread machine on white bread - manual setting and dump
  ingredients in according to your machine's preferences
  
  when cycle is all done, remove and separate into 3-4 balls of dough.
  Place on floured wax paper and let rise for about 20 mins. more (add
  a little flour if dough is too sticky). Shape, top, and bake til done
  in a very hot oven (mine goes to 550 degrees).
  
  Notes: When I didn't have cornmeal, I substituted whole wheat flour
  and it worked just as well. Also, the first time I made it, I had to
  use oil (my kids had eaten all of the applesauce) -- it worked just
  the same, so the substitution of applesauce seems to make no real
  difference in taste, texture, or appearance.

      Title: NO-ROLL PIE DOUGH
 Categories: Pies, Misc
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      3 tb Sugar
      1 pn Salt
    1/4 ts Baking powder
      6 tb Cold butter
      1 lg Egg
 
  COMBINE THE FLOUR, sugar, salt and baking powder in a mixing bowl.
  Cut the butter into six or eight pieces and distribute over the dry
  ingredients. Rub in the butter finely, using fingertips or pastry
  blender, until the mixture resembles a fine powder. DO NOT WORK THE
  MIXTURE TO THE POINT WHERE IT BEGINS TO STICK TOGETHER. Beat egg with
  a fork in a small bowl and stir into the flour-butter mixture: It
  will remain dry and crumbly. Turn the dough out into a buttered 10-
  to 11-inch removable-bottom tart pan or a 9-inch Pyrex pie pan.
  Distribute the crumbly mixture evenly around the bottom and side of
  the pan, pressing it into place with floured fingertips. As you press
  the dough into place, it will adhere together and line the pan. Avoid
  pressing the dough too hard or it will become thin in places. After
  pressing the dough into the pan, inspect the surface for any
  excessively thick or thin spots and press them even before
  proceeding. Slide dough into a plastic bag and chill several hours or
  overnight, or while preparing the filling. Makes one 10- or 11-inch
  tart shell or 9-inch pie shell.

  "For those who cannot or prefer not to eat refined sugar, this

      Title: NOISETTES OF LAMB WITH TRUFFLE & LYONNAISE
 Categories: Lamb, Potatoes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Noisettes; each 3 cm
           - (1 3/8 in) thick, taken
           - from a filleted saddle
           - of lamb
      3    Sprigs of parsley
     20 g  Truffle; 3/4 oz
    100 g  New Potatoes; 3 1/2 oz
     20 g  Onions;finely sliced rings
      1 x  Egg yolk
           Oil
     15 g  Butter; unsalted
      1 tb Veal glaze
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Note - This recipe, which takes no time at all to cook, can be
  adapted for more than one person by an appropriate increase of all
  the ingredients except the egg yolk, which will glaze enough
  noisettes for six. Take care, too, to use frying pans that are large
  enough to allow plenty of room for tossing and turning the noisettes
  and the Lyonnaise potatoes.
  
  You could substitute mushroom for truffle but, as Fredy Girardet
  would say, it won't be the same.
  
  Preparation
  
  Chop the parsley very finely; you will need 2 tablespoons full pro
  serving.
  
  Chop the truffle finely. Set a quarter of it aside for the sauce and
  mix the rest with the parsley.
  
  Using a mandoline, slice the potatoes 2mm (1/16 in) thick. Separate
  the onion slices into rings.
  
  Put the egg yolk into a little bowl. It is to be used as if for pastry
  glaze, so mix it with 1 teaspoon of water.
  
  Finishing
  
  Season the noisettes. Brush each one with the egg yolk. then roll
  them in the parsley-and-truffle mixture, pressing well to make it
  stick.
  
  Heat a little oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add the noisettes. Let
  them cook for 3 minutes, turning them once or twice, Add the butter
  and take the pan off the heat for 2 minutes to let it 'draw', then
  put the noisettes on to a heated plate. Set the pan and its juices
  aside.
  
  Cook the Lyonnaise potatoes at the same time as you cook the meat.
  Cook them in a large frying pan, in very hot oil, for 5 minutes in
  all, turning them often. Add the onion rings half-way through cooking.
  
  To make the sauce, add the rest of the truffle and a scant
  tablespoonful of the veal glaze to the juices in the pan in which you
  cooked the meat. Let the mixture bubble up once. Season with salt and
  pepper.
  
  Serving
  
  Arrange the potatoes in the centre of a heated plate. Put the
  noisettes on top and pour the sauce all round.

      1 c  Flour
      3 sm Eggs
    1/2    Egg shell of Club Soda*
           Lg. Pot of Boiling Water
 
  *Sour Cream may be substituted for Club Soda (about 1-1 1/2 tbs)
  *Water may be used in place of club soda, but will make a heavier
  dumpling If using lg. eggs, use 2 for every cup of flour Beat w/ a
  wooden spoon in a lg. bowl. "Batter" should "crack" and snap and lg.
  bubbles will rise. Batter should be stiff and very tacky, as in wall
  plaster (odd comparison to a food...)  When batter is dropped from a
  spoon, it will clump and fall very slowly, but in very lg. amts...
  unlike pancake batter... Place a few lg. tbsp. of batter on a sm.
  dessert dish. With an Ice Tea spoon, scrape pieces of the batter into
  the boiling water, dipping the spoon into the boiling water to
  facilitate ease of removing the dumpling. Repeat. Dumplings are done
  when they rise to the top of the water. Strain. Mix w/ butter, serve
  in soup, or top w/ your Chicken paprikas or szekely goulash. Can also
  use a spatzel-maker to drop the dumplings in the water. NOTE: I use 7
  c. flour and about 14 eggs. Makes a lg. amt. and we have leftover. I
  just posted the ingred. for a sm. amt. as a basic recipe. Adjust

 Categories: Breads, Russian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  ;Water, lukewarm
      1 pk Yeast, dry
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Oil
    3/4 ts Salt
      4 c  Flour, unbleached
      2 c  Flour, whole wheat
    1/2 c  Onion; minced
      1 ts Garlic; minced
 
                                         Approx. Cook Time: 3:00 In a
  large bowl, combine 1/2 cup of the water, the yeast, and sugar and
  let stand until foamy; about 5 minutes. Add the rest of the water,
  the oil, and the salt, then gradually add four cups of the unbleached
  flour and all of the whole wheat flour, one cup at a time, mixing
  well after each addition with a wooden spoon. Transfer the dough to a
  floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes,
  adding enough of the remaining unbleached flour to prevent sticking.
  Shape the dough into a ball, place in a buttered bowl and turn to
  coat. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm, draft- free
  place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Divide the dough into
  eight pieces and shape each piece into a ball. On a floured surface
  with a floured rolling pin, roll out each ball into a round about
  seven inches in diameter. With a pastry brush, brush each round with
  cold water. Cover with a towel and let stand 30 minutes. Meanwhile,
  preheat the oven to 500 F. (yes, five hundred). Place a heavy-duty
  baking sheet in the oven to heat for 15 minutes. Wet your hands in
  cold water and make an indentation in the center of each dough round
  about two inches in diameter. With a fork, prick all over the
  indentation in a circular fashion. Sprinkle with the onion and
  garlic. Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. Sprinkle the
  rounds lightly with cold water and place on the baking sheet. Bake in
  the lowest part of the oven until the breads are light golden and
  baked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, wrap in a
  clean, damp kitchen towel, and let rest for 10 minutes.

      Title: NON / FLAT ONION BREADS (CENTRAL ASIA)
 Categories: Breads, Dumplings
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      6 tb Butter
  1 1/2 c  Onions -- finely chopped
    3/4 c  Water -- lukewarm
      1 ts Salt
      3 c  All-purpose flour
 
  Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet set
  over high heat.  Add the onions, reduce the heat to low and, stirring
  occasionally, cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft but
  not brown.  Transfer them to a bowl and cool to room temperature.
  
  Melt the remaining butter in the skillet and pour it into a large
  bowl. Add the lukewarm (110 - 115 F) water and, with a large spoon,
  stir in the chopped onions, salt and 2 1/2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup at
  a time. If necessary, beat in as much of the remaining 1/2 cup of the
  flour as you need to make a dough that does not stick to your
  fingers. Gather the dough into a large, compact ball and divide it
  into 16 pieces. With the palms of your hands, shape each piece of
  dough into a 1 1/2 to 2 inch ball. Then, with a lightly floured
  rolling pin, roll out the balls one at a time into circles that are
  about 8 inches in diameter. Set the rounds of dough aside.
  
  Set a heavy 10- to 12-inch ungreased pan over high heat. When it is
  hot enough for a drop of water flicked across its surface to instantly
  evaporate, place one round of dough in the center. Brown for 3 or 4
  minutes on each side, turning it over with your fingers or a wide
  spatula; do not be concerned if the bread does not brown evenly.
  
  Transfer the bread to a rack to dry and proceed to fry and dry the
  remaining dough similarly.  Serve the bread in a basket or other
  porous container.  If for any reason the bread becomes limp after a
  day or so, place the rounds in a single layer on a cookie sheet and
  bake them for 5 to 10 minutes in a preheated 250F oven until they
  freshen.

 Categories: Side dish, Low-fat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Potatoes; well scrubbed
      1 lg Onion (yellow)
  1 1/2 c  Evaporated skim milk, approx
           -(or amazake)
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Basil
           Rosemary
           Paprika
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Thinly slice the potatoes (leaving
  skins on) and the onion.  Spray a glass baking dish with non-stick
  spray. Layer the pan alternately with the potato and onion slices.
  Just before the last layer, sprinkle on 1-3 tsp each of the pepper,
  basil, and rosemary. Add the last layer of potatoes and onions. Pour
  the evap skimmed milk (or amazake) over top. You should have enough
  liquid to almost cover the mixture. Sprinkle on some paprika. Cover
  with foil and bake for about an hour or until the liquid is all
  absorbed. Remove foil for the last 15-20 minutes to crisp it a bit.
  
  I guessed at the measurements for this dish, as I just sort of slap it
  together without measuring.  Check it to see if it will be done early
  or take a little extra time. It's a very forgiving dish. My only
  complaint is that it doesn't freeze-and-reheat well (because of the
  cooked potatoes).

  Line a strainer with a cloth napkin or coffee filter and set it over a

  "cheese" when it is     reduced to 1 cup, which may take from 4 hours
  to overnight. NOTES : This alternative to cream cheese can be used in
  dips, for desserts, or wherever a recipe calls for cream     cheese.
  The freshest yogurt makes the sweetest cheese.      Find out what day

      2 ts Soy sauce
      4 ds Tabasco sauce
      3 oz Can chow mein noodles

  Going through some old boxes, I came across this recipe from the June,
  1963, issue of Better Homes and Gardens. It is credited to a Mrs. T.A.
  Hight, Walnut Creek, CA. Even after all these years it still sounds
  pretty good. Combine melted butter, soy sauce and Tabasco; drizzle
  over noodles. Toss lightly till noodles are well-coated. Sprinkle
  noodles with celery salt and onion powder.  Again, toss until well
  mixed. Place on a baking sheet and toast at 275 for 12-15 minutes or

      8 lg Fresh sage leaves; -=OR=-
      1 ts -Dried Sage
      1 lg Garlic clove; sliced
           Salt
    1/2 lb Potatoes; peeled

      3 lg Leeks; white parts only,
           - quartered and sliced
           - 3/8-in thick
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
    1/2 ts Red pepper flakes
  1 1/2 lb Savoy cabbage; quartered
           - cut into 1/2-in slices
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
           - (fresh)
      1 lb Fettuccine
    1/2 lb Soft cheese; such as
           -Taleggio, Bel Paese
           -or Fresh Mozzarella, sliced
 
  SLOWLY MELT BUTTER IN HEAVY PAN over low heat with 4 fresh sage
  leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried, and the sliced garlic. When garlic is
  golden brown, remove it, but continue to cook butter until light
  amber with a distinctly nutty aroma. Scoop foam off top as it rises
  so that you can see the color, then pour it through strainer lined
  with layer of cheesecloth. Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to boil.
  Add 1 tablespoon salt and potatoes. Cook 5 to 8 minutes or until
  potatoes are fairly tender, but just short of being done. Rinse them
  immediately with cool water and set them in colander to drain, but
  reserve cooking water for pasta. Chop or crumble remaining sage
  leaves. Heat half the brown butter in wide saute pan, add leeks,
  sage, half the minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook over
  medium-low heat until leeks are soft. Add cabbage, 1 teaspoon salt
  and a little water. It might be necessary to add cabbage in stages,
  letting some of it cook down before adding rest. Cover pan and simmer
  until cabbage is cooked. Add Parmesan cheese and season with plenty
  of freshly ground black pepper and salt, if needed, to make flavors
  bright and strong. Return reserved cooking water to boil, add pasta
  and partially cook it, leaving it a little chewier than you would
  want to eat. Drain in colander, return it to empty pan and toss with
  rest of butter, remaining minced garlic and potatoes. Season to taste
  with salt and pepper. Butter casserole and layer half the noodles,
  half the cabbage and most of sliced cheese. Shake casserole so that
  vegetables and cheese can slip in among noodles. Add rest of pasta
  and cheese and finish with layer of cabbage. At this point, dish can
  be refrigerated until ready to bake. Bake at 425F about 20 minutes or
  until hot throughout and cheese is melted. If casserole is cold when
  placed in oven, bake it covered 15 minutes, then remove cover and
  continue baking until heated through. Serve from baking dish.

           - cut into 1/2-in slices
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
           - (fresh)
      1 lb Fettuccine
    1/2 lb Soft cheese; such as
           -Taleggio, Bel Paese
           -or Fresh Mozzarella, sliced
 
  SLOWLY MELT BUTTER IN HEAVY PAN over low heat with 4 fresh sage
  leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried, and the sliced garlic. When garlic is
  golden brown, remove it, but continue to cook butter until light
  amber with a distinctly nutty aroma. Scoop foam off top as it rises
  so that you can see the color, then pour it through strainer lined
  with layer of cheesecloth. Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to boil.
  Add 1 tablespoon salt and potatoes. Cook 5 to 8 minutes or until
  potatoes are fairly tender, but just short of being done. Rinse them
  immediately with cool water and set them in colander to drain, but
  reserve cooking water for pasta. Chop or crumble remaining sage
  leaves. Heat half the brown butter in wide saute pan, add leeks,
  sage, half the minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook over
  medium-low heat until leeks are soft. Add cabbage, 1 teaspoon salt
  and a little water. It might be necessary to add cabbage in stages,
  letting some of it cook down before adding rest. Cover pan and simmer
  until cabbage is cooked. Add Parmesan cheese and season with plenty
  of freshly ground black pepper and salt, if needed, to make flavors
  bright and strong. Return reserved cooking water to boil, add pasta
  and partially cook it, leaving it a little chewier than you would
  want to eat. Drain in colander, return it to empty pan and toss with
  rest of butter, remaining minced garlic and potatoes. Season to taste
  with salt and pepper. Butter casserole and layer half the noodles,
  half the cabbage and most of sliced cheese. Shake casserole so that
  vegetables and cheese can slip in among noodles. Add rest of pasta
  and cheese and finish with layer of cabbage. At this point, dish can
  be refrigerated until ready to bake. Bake at 425F about 20 minutes or
  until hot throughout and cheese is melted. If casserole is cold when
  placed in oven, bake it covered 15 minutes, then remove cover and
  continue baking until heated through. Serve from baking dish.

    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 oz Parmesan cheese; grated
 
  Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Break the lasagna noodles into
  smallish pieces.  Add the broken lasagna noodles to the boiling water
  and cook until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain in a colander.
  
  Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil
  until hot but not smoking.  Add the garlic and oregano and cook,
  stirring constantly, until the garlic just starts to brown, about 30
  seconds. Add the spinach and toss with two spoons to coat well with
  the oil. Cook just until wilted, stirring frequently, 3 to 4 minutes.
  
  Add the chickpeas and chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the
  heat to medium-low and simmer until the chickpeas are heated through,
  about 3 minutes.
  
  Add the drained pasta to the skillet, season with the pepper and
  salt, and toss to warm through.  Transfer to a serving bowl, top with
  the Parmesan, and serve. Serving size 1-1/2 cups.
  
  DO AHEAD STEPS:  Stem the spinach, rinse and drain the chickpeas, and
  grate the Parmesan ahead of time.
  
  Each serving provides: 1 fat, 1-1/2 proteins, 3 vegetables,
        2    breads, 4 optional calories.

 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Egg noodles
    1/2 ts Salt
           MUSTARD BUTTER:
      4 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Dijon mustard
      1 ts Fresh lemon juice
           Dash of cayenne pepper
           Small handful chopped fresh
           -parsley
 
  Bring 3 or 4 quarts of water to a boil. In the meantime prepare the
  mustard butter.  Cream the butter with the remaining ingredients by
  hand, or use a food processor or blender.
  
  Add the noodles and salt to the boiling water.  Cook the noodles
  until al dente.  (The time needed will depend greatly upon the
  thickness of the noodles, so the best test is simply bite into a
  noodle to determine whether it is done.)  Drain the noodles
  thoroughly and toss with the prepared butter until each strand is
  coated. Serve at once. Serves 6 Typed in MMFormat by

      Title: NOODLES WITH SNOW PEA GREENS
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Snow pea greens
      2    Red chilies
        x  Some rice wine (sake,
           Shaohsing, whatever)
    1/2 c  Chopped shallots
     12    Fresh shiitake mushrooms
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 ts Rice vinegar
      4    Chopped scallions
      8    To 12 ounces japanese
           Noodles (soba, udon,
           Whatever -- I used soba)
 
  Lightly steam pea greens -- crisp, but cooked. Chop chilies, shallots
  and scallons.  Slice shiitake thinly.
  
  Heat large non-stick skillet.  Roast chilies for a minute, then add
  about 1/4 cup rice wine.  Add shallots and cook till they just start
  to darken (about 4 minutes).  Add more wine if it starts to stick.
  
  (put water on to boil for noodles)
  
  With wine cooked off, add shiitake.  They should give up their own
  water. Cook another 3-5 minutes till mushrooms are fully cooked and
  pan is drying out.  Add soy sauce, vinegar, and scallions. Cook for a
  minute and then turn off burner and set aside.
  
  Water for noodles should be boiling, add noodles and cook till done,
  about 5 minutes usually.
  
  Toss noodles, pea greens and mushrooms.  Eat.
  
  Ya know, slivered shiitake reminds me of tripe when it cooks. I bet
  if you substituted shiitake for the tripe in a good recipe it would
  make a tasty dish.

      3    Stalks of Celery
      1    Large Onion, sliced
      4    Sprigs of Dill
    1/4 ts Pepper
 
  Food writer Norene Gilletz has adapted her grandmother's chicken soup
  recipe for cooking by microwave. In a soup kettle, combine chicken and
  salted water. Bring to a boil. Skim surface. Add carrots, celery,
  onion, dill and pepper to the hot broth. Cover and simmer until meat
  is tender and vegetables are cooked -- about two hours. Strain and
  refrigerate. Remove the fat that congeals on top and discard. Serve
  soup with noodles or rice, cooked separately or in the strained
  broth. Microwave method: Gilletz prefers this method, because all the
  ingredients and can be added at once and there is no need to skim the
  broth. In a bowl, pour boiling water over chicken. Trim off excess
  fat. Place chicken in a five-quart microwave-safe casserole. Cut
  carrots and celery into chunks. Add to chicken along with onion, dill
  and seasonings. cover with water. To prevent boiling over, take care
  water remains 1 1/2 inches below top of the casserole. Cover
  casserole and microwave at high (100 %) power for 30 - 35 minutes or
  until soup is boiling. Stir. Simmer at medium power for 25 - 30
  minutes. Let stand covered for 15 - 20 minutes. Strain soup. Serve as
  above. From The Gazette, 91/01/16.

      Title: NORI-MAKI SUSHI
 Categories: Vegetarian, Side dish, Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Sticky rice
  2 1/4 c  ;water
    1/3 c  Vinegar, rice
  1 1/2 tb Sugar, granulated
    1/2 ts Salt
      8    Nori sheets (use pretoasted
           -nori, especially made for
           -making sushi)

MMMMM-------------------------VEGETABLES------------------------------
           -Choose from among the
           -following vegetables:
           Daikon radish, raw or
           -pickled
           Cucumber; peeled, seeded
           -and quartered lengthwise
           Avocado
           Carrot
           Zucchini
      3 tb Wasabi powder; divided
           Ginger, pickled

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
    3/4 c  Vegetable stock
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Sake or dry sherry
 
   Soak the rice in a bowl of cold water. Swish around with your hands
  and drain when the water becomes cloudy. Fill with water again and
  repeat the procedure until the water remains very clear.
  
   Place the rice in a heavy 4-quart saucepan. Add the water and cover
  with the lid. Bring the water to a boil without lifting the lid
  (watch for the lid jiggling). Reduce the heat to medium high and cook
  for 5 minutes. Listen for a hissing or crackling sound to indicate
  that the water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat, and still
  without lifting the lid, let the rice stand for 20 to 30 minutes.
  
   Transfer the rice to a large bowl. Toss with a Japanese paddle or a
  wooden spoon until it stops steaming.
  
   In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, sugar and salt.
   Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Sprinkle into the rice, a little
  at a time, and toss in. Cover the vinegared rice mixture with a clean
  tea towel and set aside until needed. Don't refrigerate it.
  
   Use one shee of nori as a guide for cutting the vegetables. The
  vegetables you use should be cut into very thin, very long
  matchsticks; their length should match the width of a sheet of nori.
  The exception to this is avocado, which won't be long enough, but
  this isn't a problem because of its soft texture. Just cut the strips
  lengthwise. The idea is to use about 6 strips of vegetable in each
  sushi roll; you may use one type of vegetable in each roll, or
  combine two, for example, cucumber and avocado.
  
   Take a tablespoon of the wasabi powder and combine it in a small
  bowl with enough water to make a thin paste.
  
   Place a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on a sudare, a bamboo mat
  made expressly for rolling sushi (available at oriental markets).
  Dampen your hands and spread 3/4 cup of the vinegared rice over the
  surface of the nori, leaving a 1/2 inch border on the end nearest you
  and a 2 inch border on the end farthest away.
  
   Abuot 1 1/2 inches from the side closest to you, paint a stripe of
  wasabi paste (use very little) across the rice. Lay 6 or so strips of
  vegetable atop the stripe.
   Lift the side of the mat closest to you and roll it over so the nori
  is tightly rolled over the rice and vegetables. Wet the far end of
  the nori and continue the rolling motion until the result is a snugly
  closed roll.
  
   Lay the rolled nori seam-side down on a board, adn repeat with the
  remaining sheets of nori.
  
   You'll need a very sharp knife to cut the rolls. Wet the knife
  lightly and cut each roll into six equal sections. Arrange on a large
  platter.
  
   In a small bowl, combine the remaining wasabi with enough water to
  make a fairly thick paste, thicker than what you made for the sushi
  rolls. Guests should take a small dab on their plates to be spread on
  the sushi rolls if they'd like. Put some pickled ginger in another
  small bowl. Let each guest take a slice or two.
  
   Dipping sauce:
  
   Combine the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Divide the dipping sauce
  among six small Oriental bowls and set next to each guest's plate for
  dipping the sushi rolls.

      3 c  ;Water
      8 c  Soft breadcrumbs or
           -unseasoned croutons
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
      2 tb Poultry seasoning
      1 ts Dried whole oregano
      1 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/3 lb Italian sausage
      4 c  Onion; chopped
      2 c  Cooking apples
           -- peeled and chopped
    2/3 c  Canned chestnuts; chopped
    1/3 c  Pine nuts
      2    Eggs; beaten
      1 ts Dried whole rosemary
           -- crushed
  1 1/2 c  Chablis or other dry white
           -wine
 
  Remove giblets and neck from turkey; rinse and place in a small
  saucepan with 3 cups water.  Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and
  simmer 30 minutes. Remove giblets and neck from broth, reserving
  broth. Set aside and let cool.
  
  Combine breadcrumbs and next 4 ingredients in a large bowl, stirring
  well. Set aside.
  
  Remove sausage from casing.  Cook sausage in a large skillet over
  high heat until sausage browns, stirring to crumble meat. Remove meat
  with a slotted spoon, reserving pan drippings in skillet. Add sausage
  to breadcrumb mixture; stir well.  Add onion to pan drippings in
  skillet; cook over medium heat until golden. Remove with a slotted
  spoon and stir into breadcrumb mixture.  Combine apples, chestnuts
  and pine nuts. Add to breadcrumb mixture, stirring well. Remove meat
  from reserved turkey neck; coarsely chop meat and giblets. Stir meat
  and giblets into breadcrumb mixture.  Combine eggs and 1 cup reserved
  broth; stir well. Pour over breadcrumb mixture and stir well.
  
  Rinse turkey with cold water; pat dry.  Stuff dressing into body
  cavities of turkey.  If excess skin around tail has been cut away,
  tuck legs under flap of skin around tail. If skin is intact, close
  cavity with skewers and truss.  Tie ends of legs to tail with cord.
  Lift wingtips up and over back; tuck under bird. Spoon remaining
  dressing into a greased 11 x 7 x 2" baking dish.  Cover and chill.
  
  Place turkey in a shallow roasting pan, breast side up; rub bird with
  crushed rosemary.  Pour wine into roasting pan around bird. Insert
  meat thermometer in meaty part of turkey thigh, making sure
  thermometer does not touch bone.  Bake at 325 F. until meat
  thermometer reaches 185 F. If turkey starts to brown too much, cover
  loosely with aluminum foil.
  
  When turkey is two-thirds done, cut the cord or band of skin holding
  drumstick ends to tail; this will ensure that the thighs are cooked
  internally.  Turkey is done when drumsticks are easily moved up and
  down. Let stand 15 minutes before carving.
  
  Bake remaining dressing at 350 F. for 30 to 40 minutes.
  
  Yield:  18 to 20 servings.

      3 tb All natural butter flavored
           Sprinkles
      2 tb Dutch Processed European
           Style cocoa
      4 tb Instant non-fat dry milk
           Powder
      1 c  (+2T) water
      1 tb Pecan pieces (would be
           Optional)
 
  If using an electric stove, preheat the largest burner to highest
  setting Line a 6" x 8" x 2" pan or dish with aluminum foil. No need
  to veggie spray the foil since the fudge will not stick.
  
  Combine all ingredients (except the pecan pieces) in a 10" dutch oven
  (he uses cast iron).  Place on preheated burner and bring to a full
  rolling boil while stirring continuously - Cook 4.5 minutes, stirring
  continuously with a stainless steel whisk.
  
  Remove from heat and continue stirring until mixture stops boiling.
  
  Set a sheet pan (approx. 10" x 15") on top of a cold wet towel (cold
  tap water is fine).  Pour mixture onto the sheet pan. Using a
  spatula, move mixture around so as to combine and blend those fudge
  crystals beginning to form on the bottom of the pan.
  
  After 2-3 minutes move sheet pan to a fresh cold towel and continue
  blending
  
  After a few minutes move sheet to another cold towel and as mixture
  starts to thicken begin moving and accumulating the mixture to the
  corner of the pan. As mixture becomes very thick, pour out into the
  foil lined pan. Spread fudge evenly and sprinkle the pecan pieces on
  top.

      Title: NORTH CAROLINA BARBEQUE
 Categories: Pork & ham, Bar-b-q
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2    Pork picnic shoulder roasts
      6 lb Each,
           Bone in, rind removed
     12    Cloves garlic -- peeled
      3 c  Cider vinegar
           MOPPING SAUCE:
           The 12 garlic cloves that
           Cooked with the
           Pork
      1 ts Coarse (kosher) salt
    1/4 c  Reserved pork-simmering
           Liquid
    3/4 ts Sugar
      1 tb Cayenne
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
  3 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
           MIXING SAUCE:
  1 1/2 c  Reserved Mopping Sauce
    1/4 c  Reserved pork-simmering
           Liquid
    1/3 c  Smoky-flavored barbecue
           Sauce (not
           Too sweet)
           Salt
           Hot-pepper sauce for
           Seasoning at
           Table
 
  Place the roasts, the garlic, and the 3 cups of vinegar in a very
  large deep stockpot or flameproof casserole. (If necessary, divide
  the roasts, garlic, and vinegar evenly between 2 smaller pots.) Add
  water to cover by at least 2 inches and bring to a boil over high
  heat. Reduce the heat, partially cover, and simmer for 2-1/2 hours,
  adding boiling water as needed to keep the meat covered.  Remove the
  roasts from the pot, reserving the cooked garlic cloves and 1/2 cup
  of the pork-simmering liquid. Place the roasts on a rack in a large
  roasting pan. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the Mopping Sauce.  In a large bowl, mash the
  cooked garlic to a paste with the salt. Add 1/4 cup of the reserved
  pork-simmering liquid, the sugar, cayenne, pepper and 3-1/2 cups of
  vinegar and mix well. Remove 1-1/2 cups of the Mopping Sauce and set
  it aside to be used later in the Mixing Sauce. Use the remaining
  Mopping Sauce to baste the pork as it roasts.  With a clean new
  dishmop or paintbrush, baste the roasts with Mopping Sauce and place
  them in a 350 degree oven. Immediately reduce the heat to 300
  degrees. Cook for 2 hours, basting every 15 minutes and turning once
  or twice.  Use all of the Mopping Sauce (but none of the reserved
  Mopping Sauce). Remove the pork from the oven and transfer to a large
  chopping board.  Spoon or pour all fat out of the roasting pan and
  set the pan aside.  Do not wash it. The pork roasts should be a
  little crusty on the outside and very tender and moist inside.
  Discard the bones and remove any fat.  With a heavy large knife,
  chop/shred the lean pork fairly fine. Transfer to a large bowl and
  cover loosely to keep warm and moist.
  
  Proceed immediately to make the Mixing Sauce.  Place the empty,
  unwashed roasting pan over very low heat and add 1/2 cup of the
  reserved Mopping Sauce.  Scrape the pan to loosen caramelized juices
  and browned bits, stirring quickly and constantly so none of the
  flavorful liquid evaporates. Pour every last drop of this "essence of
  barbecue" back into the remaining reserved Mopping Sauce.  Add the
  1/4 cup of reserved pork-simmering liquid. Stir in the smoky-flavored
  barbecue sauce and season with salt to taste. This Mixing Sauce will
  mellow considerably as the barbecue "ripens." Add half the Mixing
  Sauce to the chopped pork and mix well. Gradually blend in the
  remaining Mixing Sauce. Let cool, cover tightly, and refrigerate for
  at least 12 hours to let the flavor develop. (Chopped barbecue can be
  prepared in advance and refrigerated for up to 2 days, or frozen for
  up to 2 months.)  Let return to room temperature before reheating,
  covered, in a microwave oven or 300 degree conventional oven. Adjust
  the seasonings as necessary and serve hot. Cole slaw is traditional
  with chopped barbecue, and hot-pepper sauce is a must.

      Title: NORTH CAROLINA CHOPPED BARBECUED PORK
 Categories: Crockpot, Main dish, Pork, Sandwiches
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Pork shoulder roast
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Celery seed
   1/16 ts Cinnamon, ground
   3/16 c  Vinegar, cider
    1/4 c  Catsup
    1/4 ts Chili powder
    1/4 ts Nutmeg, ground
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
           Vinegar, cider; to taste
           Sauce, Tabasco; to taste
 
  Brown roast in a small amount of fat and place in a Dutch oven. Mix
  the next 9 ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour over
  roast and cover.  Bake in a preheated 325^ oven, 40 minutes to the
  pound, until done, basting occasionally with drippings.
  
  Transfer roast to a chopping board.  Remove meat from the bone and
  chop into fairly fine pieces. Season to taste with additional vinegar
  and hot sauce.  Serve hot with coleslaw and corn bread.
  
  Sylvia's comments: I found some stew pork marked WAY down, bought
  several packages ($.99/lb!) and stuck them in the freezer. Then I put
  all the ingredients, including the still-frozen pork, in the crockpot
  this morning. Tonight it was done, I just mashed up the meat with a
  fork and knife and served it over rice. The vinegar produces a very
  interesting taste. However, it came out kind of soupy; next time I'll
  leave out the water and increase the catsup.
  
  This is the most popular barbecue dish in North Carolina, and, as far
  as we know, it is indigenous to that state.

   *NOTE: If you don't want to buy buttermilk, substitute 1/2 c. milk
  with 1 T. lemon juice added. Stir and let it sit for 5 minutes. It
  works just as well.  Please note: You can make variations of this
  recipe in several ways: i.e., 1/4 c. finely chopped onion, less
  sugar, etc. But, at the coast of NC the above type recipe is usually
  served. Judy Garnett, pjxg05a, Raleigh,NC >>>>>

  can plum (Italian-style) tomatoes, drained and chopped
  
  Not unlike a That version of spaghetti sauce, this is from the
  regional cuisine of north Thailand. Note: Dried shrimp and shrimp
  paste give off a strong aroma during cooking, but the flavor mellows.
  
  Place pork in a food processor and using an on/off motion, process
  until it is ground. Alternatively, chop pork with a sharp knife. Set
  aside.
  
  In a heavy, medium-sized saucepan, heat oil over medium high heat. Add
  garlic and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until browned. Add
  shallots, chilies, dried shrimp or shrimp paste and lemon grass and
  stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the pork and stir-fry for about 1
  minute, or until browned. Add tomatoes, stock or water, fish sauce
  and sugar and increase the heat to high. Cook, stirring frequently,
  for 2 minutes, or until the mixture boils vigorously. Reduce heat to
  low and simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until slightly
  thickened. Serve with sticky rice.
  
  Serves 4 as a main dish or 6 in combination with other dishes.

  until it is ground. Alternatively, chop pork with a sharp knife. Set
  aside.
  
  In a heavy, medium-sized saucepan, heat oil over medium high heat. Add
  garlic and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until browned. Add
  shallots, chilies, dried shrimp or shrimp paste and lemon grass and
  stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the pork and stir-fry for about 1
  minute, or until browned. Add tomatoes, stock or water, fish sauce
  and sugar and increase the heat to high. Cook, stirring frequently,
  for 2 minutes, or until the mixture boils vigorously. Reduce heat to
  low and simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until slightly
  thickened. Serve with sticky rice.

  MEASURE FLOUR into a large mixing bowl; add boiling water, stirring
  quickly with chopsticks or fork, then add cold water and mix well.
  Work dough until smooth and supple. Roll dough into shape of a ball.
  Cover well with plastic wrap or damp cloth; set aside to rest for 1
  hour at room temperature. Place the chicken in a small bowl; add
  cornstarch, cooking sherry and pinch of salt. Set aside and
  refrigerate and let marinate until ready to use. Stir-fry Chinese
  sausage and dried shrimp in hot vegetable oil in a small frying pan
  over high heat for 1 minute. Add chicken with its marinade and
  stir-fry for another 2 minutes. Quickly stir in barbecued pork and
  3/4 cup of the minced onions. (Set aside remaining onions for pancake
  wrappers.) Immediately season with the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar
  and salt, and mix well. Turn off heat; divide into 16 portions and
  set aside. Knead dough until smooth and divide equally into 16
  pieces; cover with plastic wrap. Work 1 piece of dough at a time,
  keeping the rest covered in plastic wrap. Take a piece of dough and
  rub both sides with a bit of shortening, then roll out with a rolling
  pin to 6 inches in diameter. Again rub shortening (about 1 teaspoon)
  onto 1 side of the dough; sprinkle evenly with about 1 teaspoon
  minced scallions and a pinch of salt. Curl up the dough from 1 end
  into a long, narrow cylinder; then curl up again lengthwise into a
  snail-like cylinder. Place the dough on its broad side and roll out
  again with a rolling pin into a piece about 4 inches in diameter.
  Place one portion of filling in center of dough and seal well on top
  by pinching the dough like a dumpling. Flatten into a 2-inch-diameter
  onion pancake. Set aside. Repeat until all the dough is prepared. Pan
  fry the onion pancakes in a thin layer of hot vegetable oil over
  medium heat, about 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Pat
  the onion pancakes gently with a paper towel to remove excess oil
  before serving. Makes 16 Pancakes, or 8 Servings

  Been returning to my culinary "roots" so to speak.  I pulled out a
  couple of great little cookbooks that I got years ago when I was
  first getting into Oriental cooking. These are those little recipe
  card like books with spiral bindings that you see here and there in
  Asian markets and the like. I'd forgotten how good these recipes are
  since collecting larger and flashier cookbooks, but these are some of
  the recipes that convinced me that I really did want to become
  proficient at Chinese cooking. They are simple, authentic and *very*
  tasty!
  
  This first one calls for beef, but the other night I substituted pork
  for the beef and the result was excellent. The finished dish is rich,
  as hot as you like it and slightly sweet. The only "exotic"
  ingredient is the "soy beans with chili condiment" and it's not too
  exotic these days. (Sorry, Jeff++no dried duck webs here!) Any market
  with a good Oriental section should have it.  The stuff I use is put
  out in 8 oz. bottles by Lan Chi and is called "Chilli Paste with Soy
  Bean". It's quite hot and has a wonderful, slightly "smoky" flavor.
  
  (I'm copying these recipes out verbatim to capture the flavor of the
  book.)
  
  This blend of flavors will remind you of hot dishes from other parts
  of the world.  This chili flavor combine [sic] is entirely different
  from the chili used in Mexican dishes, for instance
  
  1.  Mix gravy ingredients in a small bowl.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Heat wok on high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon oil. Slosh around. Add
  vegetables and stir-fry until half done about 2 minutes. Remove to
  platter.
  
  3.  Clean wok.  Reheat over high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon oil. Slosh
  around. Add beef, garlic and ginger. Toss-fry for about 3 minutes and
  when meat is pinkish add gravy ingredients.  Stir-fry another minute
  or so until thickened.  Add precooked vegetables. Toss-fry another
  minute to blend and heat through.

           -garnish
 
  Combine all dry ingredients (except for confectioners sugar). Add
  liquid ingredients (except for 1 1/2 cups of oil) one at a time,
  stirring between additions. Mix in apple. Let batter sit for 10
  minutes. In a 1-quart saucepan over medium high-heat, heat the oil
  until it crackles, not quite to the smoking point. Take precautionary
  measures for using hot oil! Drop batter into the oil 1 tbls. at a
  time (get close so the oil doesn't splash). Fry only 2 or 3 fritters
  at a time. Don't crowd the pan. Flip the fritters over and remove
  onto a paper towel when golden brown. Sprinkle with confectioners
  sugar and serve.
  
  Makes 15 to 18 fritters.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Whole salmon fillet -- * see
           Note
      2 tb Butter -- melted
      3 tb Honey -- melted
      1 tb Dill weed
      2 c  Alder wood chips -- opt
 
  Have the samon filleted leaving the skin on. This is important. Keep
  cold. Melt together and melt the butter and honey in the micro or
  another way. Lay the fillet out skin side down and pour over or
  quickly brush on the honey and butter. Sprinkle the dill weed over.
  By having the filet cold the honey and butter mixture will congeal
  and the filet will be easy to handle. Place the filet skin side UP
  over a moderate grill. As soon as the meat just starts to firm up
  turn to skin side down. (The skin will keep the filet together)
  Remove from the grill as soon as the meat starts to flake. On large
  filets I use two spatulas.Serve with a green salad and augratin
  potatos.

  Try mixing Vanilla and egg  beat until mixed. Add the Buttermilk and
  the Soda; (I have used 7up) and sift the dry ingredients into this.
  add the rest of the ingredients, mix well. Put the container into the
  refrigerator chill over night. Take out and roll small pieces of the
  dough into long strips, then form them into a figure eight,(like a
  pretzel) put them back into the Refrigerator for about an hour, when
  they have raised to approximately what looks to be the right hight.
  Bake in a 450 deg pre-heated oven for approximately 6 to 8 minutes, (
  May vary with the weather so keep an eye on them).But they should be
  a light brown before you remove them. Refrigeration is one of the
  keys of "KRINGLA" making. They must be refrigerated in order for them
  to get the flavor, you could bake them without refrigeration but you
  lose a lot of the flavor. You can also use.
  
  A:  OATMEAL. B: RAISINS. C: WHOLE WHEAT.
  
  You can fill them with your favorite filling, Cream Cheese, Jelly,
  ETC. you don't need eggs or yeast. They are not too sweet, and
  definitely not Boring like a bagel, (Sorry Bagel lovers, VBG). It is
  a coffee Bread not like Muffins, which are too sweet, and also do not
  have too many calories. This recipe came from a fella from the town
  of LOS OSOS CA He is a out of work Carpenter who started baking and
  selling these wonderful Rolls, He said that this is an original
  recipe that he got from his grandmother, (Yea for the Grandmas). Ive
  tried Nuts, and love the cream Cheese one, You could even use Custard
  Filling, Ive also used Different flavored oils like Pure orange oil,
  Butterscotch, several Berries types. and they turned out just great.
  Hope you enjoy them. Formatted by Elaine Radis

      Title: NORWEGIAN FLATBREAD
 Categories: Crackers, Norwegian
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      2 sm Potatoes, boiled or baked
           And pureed in the blender
           Or food processor (about
           1/2 cup)
      2 c  Of rye flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Water or potato water
 
  "It is impossible to find a more spartan cracker than Norwegian
  Flatbread. It can be made with only rye flour, salt, and water, but
  adding a pureed vegetable, such as potatoes, increases the nutritive
  value and adds subtle flavor. This flatbread is excellent with mild
  cheeses.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, blend the pureed potato,
  flour, and salt together.
  
  Add the water and blend well until the dough will hold together in a
  cohesive ball. With a sharp knife, divide into 10 equal portions. Turn
  these out, one at a time, onto a floured surface and roll into
  circles. Roll as thin as possible, at most 1/8 inch, so each is
  approximately 7 to 8 inches across. Prick all over with the tines of
  a fork.
  
  Lightly oil a griddle or large skillet and heat until it is very hot.
  One by one, place the rolled circles onto the griddle and cook until
  the bottoms begin to show light browning. Then turn and cook the
  other side. Keep turning until the whole cracker is dry and crisp. Do
  not allow the flatbread to get more than medium brown. Cool on a
  rack. Yield: 10.
  
  VARIATIONS: Substitute any pureed vegetable for potatoes. Flours
  other than rye can also be used. Try wheat or barley. If the dough is
  too sticky to roll, add a little more flour. Letting the dough rest
  for an hour after mixing will also make it easier to roll.
  
  Flatbread can also be cooked in the oven. Bake on an ungreased baking
  sheet at 400~F. for 8 to 12 minutes, or until crisp, turning 2 or 3
  times.

 Categories: Breads, Machine, Holidays
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Low-fat or regular eggnog,
           Heated to 105 to 115 degrees
      2 c  Bread flour (to 2 1/4c)
      1 ts Ground cardamom
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 lg Egg
      1 lg Egg yolk
      4 tb Unsalted butter, softened
    1/3 c  Dried currants or raisins
    1/3 c  Chopped candied fruit & rind
           Confectioners' sugar glaze
 
   1. Combine yeast and eggnog in the bucket of a bread machine,
  stirring to dissolve yeast. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
  Add 1 cup flour. Begin dough cycle, letting it run just long enough
  to mix dough. Stop cycle and  leave mixture in bucket, covered, until
  it is light and puffy, about 1 hour.
  
   2. Add 1 cup of the remaining flour, the cardamom, salt, egg, egg
  yolk and butter. Begin dough cycle. After dough is mixed and as it is
  still kneading, check the texture of the dough and add additional
  flour as needed, to make a  soft, slightly sticky dough. Add currants
  and fruit as indicated in instruction manual. Complete dough cycle.
  When bread is cool, glaze if  desired.
  
   Note: If you prefer a traditional shape, the dough can be removed
  from the bread machine after the rising cycle. Shape dough into an
  oval, place it on a greased baking sheet, cover and let rise at room
  temperature for about 40 minutes. Brush the loaf with a glaze made
  from an egg yolk mixed with 1 tablespoon whipping cream; sprinkle
  with coarse sugar. Bake in a heated 325 degree oven until golden, 30
  to 35 minutes.

  Article by By Nanette Blanchard
  
  Most of the countries of the world serve some sort of pancake, from
  French crepes to Russian blini. Even waffles can either be Belgian or
  just plain American. Unfortunately, many waffle and pancake recipes
  are high in fat and really heavy. Is it possible to lighten up your
  morning pancakes? Yes, it is!
  
  Sourdough starters, yeast, and other leaveners like baking soda and
  baking powder are used in dairy-free pancakes and waffles. All these
  batters will improve after standing; so don't be afraid to cover and
  refrigerate overnight before cooking. Leftover pancakes and waffles
  freeze quite well. I use the microwave to heat up frozen pancakes,
  and I pop frozen waffles into the toaster to regain their nice crispy
  texture.
  
  Pancakes should be cooked on a hot griddle. One way to prepare
  pancakes for a large group of people at the same time is to use a
  large griddle or two or three nonstick skillets at once. I have a
  nice enameled cast iron griddle that fits over two range burners; so
  I can prepare about 8-10 pancakes at the same time. To keep pancakes
  warm until serving time, place on a platter covered with foil in a
  200- degree oven. Waffles should be placed directly on your oven's
  racks at 200 degrees to keep warm.
  
  All waffle irons are not created equal. I've tested several different
  models and found some are more nonstick than others. To prevent a
  sticky waffle disaster, pre-season your waffle iron each time you
  make a batch by brushing  with vegetable oil or spraying with
  vegetable cooking spray. Repeat this process if you notice the
  waffles beginning to stick.
  
  Whether you use your grandmother's heavy old four-waffle baker or one
  of the new fancy-shaped nonstick models, you really don't need to use
  a lot of oil to cook waffles.  Some new waffle irons have a
  temperature setting which gives you more control over the waffle's
  doneness. (All the waffles in this article were tested in
  Vitantonio's Five-of-Hearts nonstick waffler.)

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6    Main dish servings
      1 lb Red beans
      2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Onion powder
  1 1/2 ts Dried basil
      1 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Dry mustard
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
    1/2 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Dried oregano
    1/2 ts Cayenne
      3 c  Chopped onions, divided
      1 c  Chopped green bell pepper
    1/2 c  Chopped celery
  8 1/2 c  Chicken stock or broth,
           -divided
      2 c  Grape juice, divided
      4 c  Cooked long-grain white rice
 
  1)  Day 1:  Rinse beans, place in a medium bowl and add enough water
  to cover by 3 or 4 inches.  Soak overnight in the refrigerator. As
  the beans absorb the water, they will more than double in volume. 2)
  Day 2: Combine the seasoning mix ingredients (salt, onion powder,
  basil, garlic powder, mustard, black pepper, white pepper, oregano
  and cayenne) in a small bowl. Drain and rinse the beans.  Drain again
  and set aside. 3) Preheat a heavy 5-quart pot, preferably nonstick,
  over high heat for about 4 minutes. (If using a lighter pot, use
  lower heat.) Add 2 cups of the onions, bell pepper, celery and 1
  tablespoon of the seasoning mix. Stir and cook until vegetables start
  to brown, about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the chicken stock, scrape
  the bottom of the pot to clear all browned bits, and cook 3 minutes.
  4) Add the remaining onions, stir, and cook 5 minutes. Add the
  drained beans, 5 cups of the stock, and the remaining seasoning mix.
  Stir and cook for 45 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot
  occasionally to check for sticking and reducing heat if mixture is
  boiling too rapidly. 5) Add 1 cup grape juice and continue to cook
  for 25 minutes. Caution: At this point, the starches in the beans
  start to break down and sticking will occur more often.  It is
  therefore important to check and clear the bottom of the pot
  frequently. Add the remaining stock and grape juice, turn the heat to
  medium, and cook until the beans are tender, and the liquid is thick
  and begins to look creamy, about 30-35 minutes. 6) Serve over the hot
  rice. from chef paul prudhomme

      Title: NOV-DINNER: MAPLE ORANGE CORNISH HENS
 Categories: Poultry etc, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Maple syrup, or
           -packed brown sugar
    1/3 c  Orange juice
      2 tb White wine
      2 ts Dried rosemary, chopped
      3    Cornish hens (1-1/4lb ea)
      1 tb Orange rind, finely grated
        pn Salt
        pn Pepper
           Fresh rosemary sprigs
           Fresh orange slices
 
  There are two possible methods of preparing these Cornish Hens: 1.
  Cut the hens in half before roasting; and 2. Cook the juicy glazed
  birds whole - easing the orange rind in between skin and breast, then
  tying the legs together and roasting at 375F 190C for 1 hour. Use
  kitchen shears to cut the hens in half to serve.
  
  For this recipe...
  
  In small saucepan, whisk together maple syrup, orange juice, wine and
  rosemary. Bring to boil; boil for 3-5 minutes or until glaze is
  slightly thickened. Let cool slightly.
  
  Meanwhile, cut wing tips from hens. Using kitchen shears or sharp
  knife, cut along each side of backbone; discard backbone. cut through
  breast bone to separate into halves. Trim off excess fat and skin.
  
  Place hens, skin side up, on foil-lined baking sheet. Season lightly
  with salt and pepper; brush with one-third of the glaze.
  
  Bake hens in 375F 190C oven, brushing with glaze twice, for 45
  minutes or until browned and juices run clear when hen is pressed.
  
  Arrange hens on serving platter; garnish attractively with rosemary
  and orange slices.

  flour, vanilla and orange rind. Pour over baked crust.
  
  Set foil-wrapped pan in larger pan; pour in enough hot water to come
  1 inch up sides. Bake in 325F 160C oven for 50-60 minutes or until
  set. Remove from water. Run knife around edge of cake; remove foil
  and let cool on rack. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours. [Cheesecake
  can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.] Remove side of pan.

      Yield: 1 Serving
 
  2 1/2 lb Top sirloin or top round
           Roast
      3 ts Coriander seeds
      1 ts Cumin seeds
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      4 ts Thai light soy sauce-Aew Sai
  1 1/2 c  Oil
 
  Slice beef across the grain 2"X 3" in size and 1/4" thick. Roast

  cool, and grind coarsely in a mortar or a spice grinder. Combine beef
  and the rest of the ingredients and marinade 1 hour. Place beef
  pieces on a cake rack sprayed with Pam and put the rack in a foil
  lined cookie sheet large enough to catch any liquid dripping from the
  beef. Place the cookie sheet in a lowest setting oven until the beef
  pieces are dry to the touch and no liquid seep out when pressed
  (between 6-12 hours depending on the oven). Over medium-low heat,
  heat the oil in a flat-bottomed fry pan and drop the beef in 5-6
  pieces at a time. Fry until crispy on the outside and around the
  edges. Drain on a cake rack over paper towels. Keeps up to 1 week in
  an airtight container at room temperature. Serve alone or with cooked
  sticky rice.
  
  NOTE: Tenderize beef lightly with a mallet if using other cuts of

      Title: NUE GRA PAO: STIR-FRIED BEEF WITH MINT
 Categories: Thai, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Flank steak
     14    Serrano chilies
           - finely chopped
    1/4 c  Finely chopped garlic
    1/2 c  Finely chopped yellow onion
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil; PLUS:
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3 tb Fish sauce
      1 tb Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Water (more if needed)
    1/2 c  Mint or basil leaves
           - (loosely packed)
           Green lettuce leaves
 
  This is a rich, hearty dish with plenty of typical Thai flavors. Any
  kind of beef may be used, but flank steak works particularly well
  because it is easy to cut it across the grain, which helps keep the
  meat from falling apart during stir-frying and produces a tender
  result. Be sure to serve plenty of rice, because it helps moderate
  the hot chilies without detracting from the flavor.  You may reduce
  the number of chilies by up to one half, but traditionally this dish
  should have a rich, hot chili flavor.
  
  =======================================================
  ===============
  
  1.  Slice the beef across the grain into strips 1/4 inch thick and 2
  to 3 inches long.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Pound or grind the chilies, garlic, and onion to a coarse paste
  in a mortar or blender.  If you use a blender you may need to add the
  oil to aid in grinding.
  
  3.  Heat a wok, add the oil, and swirl it over the surface of the
  pan. (Do not add more oil if you have ground the chilies, onion, and
  garlic in oil.) Add the paste from Step 2 and stir-fry until it is
  light golden.
  
  4.  Add the beef and stir-fry until it is a uniform tan color, but do
  not overcook it.
  
  5.  Add the fish sauce, sugar, water, and mint (or basil) leaves. More
  water may be added if the sauce is too dry. There should be about 1/2
  to 3/4 cup sauce, depending on how much water you added.
  
  Ahead of time note: The dish may be prepared a day in advance to this
  point.  To do so, proceed through Step 5, omitting the mint or basil
  leaves.  When you are ready to serve, heat the mixture and add the
  leaves. If the meat has absorbed the liquid, add just enough warm
  water to bring it back to the original consistency.
  
  6.  Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves in a serving bowl and
  put the beef mixture over them. Serve the beef immediately or keep it
  warm while preparing other dishes.
  
  7.  Serve with rice.
  
  (Serves 4 to 6)

      Title: NUE NAM TOK: GRILLED BEEF WITH THAI SEASONING
 Categories: Thai, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Serrano chilies
    1/4 c  White vinegar
  1 1/2 lb Flank steak
    1/4 lb Red onion; sliced
      4    Green onions
    1/4 c  Lime juice; PLUS:
      1 tb Lime juice
      2 tb Fish sauce
      1 ts Ground roasted chilies *
      2 tb Ground toasted rice **
           Red lettuce leaves
           Coriander sprigs
           Mint or Basil leaves
 
  1.  Remove the stems, but not the seedes, from the chilies. Slice the
  chiles crosswise into pieces 1/8" thick. Place the sliced chiles and
  vinegar in a small serving bowl. Let it stand for at least 15 minutes.
  
  2.  Grill the beef to the desired doneness, preferably over charcoal.
  Slice it across the grain into strips 1/8" thick and 1 to 2 inches
  long. Put these in a large ceramic bowl.
  
  3.  Peel the red onion, remove the root portion, and slice the onion
  vertically into thin strips.  Slice the green onion diagonally into
  thin pieces.  Add both types of onion to the beef.
  
  4.  Add the lime juice, fish sauce, ground chilies, and ground rice.
  Mix well
  
  5.  Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves on a serving platter, and
  place th beef mixture on top. Garnish with sprigs of coriander and
  mint or basil leaves.
  
  6.  Serve at room temperature, the vinegar sauce (from Step 1) and
  rice.
  
  *  Use small hot chilies about 3 to 4 inches long. Roast whole chillie
  stems and all, in a dry wok or skillet until the color changes to
  dark red or brown depending on the chilies used. Be careful not to
  let them burn. When the chilies have cooled, remove the stems and
  seeds. Place the chilies in a food processor or blender and grind
  using short pulses. Pre-ground chilies are also commercially
  available, but often lack the "bite" of home ground ones and may be
  more expensive.
  
  ** Place uncooked rice in a dry wok or skillet and heat over moderate
  heat until deep golden brown,s tirring frequently to keep from
  burning and to allow it to develop a uniform color. Watch the rice
  carefully after it begins to change colorand stir constantly because
  it can burn easily at this stage. When it is auniform deep golden
  color, remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.  Grind
  it to a fine powder in a blender or a spice grinder. This can be made
  in advance and kept in quantity so that there is always a supply on
  hand, but it is also easy to make up while preparing the dish.

 Categories: Thai, Beef
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Lean Beef
      2 ts Ground Coriander Seeds
    1/2 ts Ground Cumin - Coarse
      1 tb Good Quality Fish Sauce
    1/2 c  Sugar
           Oil for Frying
 
  Wash beef, and trim of all fat and gristle.  Use a very sharp knife,
  slice the beef into fairly large, very thin, sheets. Place the pieces
  of beef into a bowl and add fish sauce. Mix, and lightly knead by
  hand till well mixed and the beef had "soften".  Add sugar, and
  continue to knead till the sugar is dissolved and well mixed in. To
  taste, take a small piece, and fry till done, and taste.  Adjust
  tastes, if required, by adding more sugar or fish sauce to the
  uncooked beef.
  
  Add coarsely ground coriander seeds and cumin.  Mix together well.
  Remove the beef pieces, spread out in a single layer on a wire rack
  and dry in the sun. When top side is dry, turn the beef pieces over
  to dry the other side. Caution....do NOT over-dry, or the end result
  will be dry and hard.
  
  When properly dried, the beef may be stored in airtight container -
  refrigeration is recommended.  To serve, add a little oil to a hot
  pan, and add the beef pieces when the oil is hot. Use medium to low
  heat, and fry till the beef pieces are cooked and crispy. Remove from
  pan, and drain of excess oil.  Blot off remaining oil with paper
  towels, and serve when cool.

      Title: NUOC CHAM  (VIETNAMESE CHILI SAUCE FOR DIPPIN
 Categories: Chili
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Nuoc Cham  (Vietnamese
           -Chili Sauce for dipping)
 
  2    Dried red chilies 2 Cloves garlic 1/2 t Sugar 2 T Fish sauce 1 T
  Vinegar 1 T Lemon juice
  
  Mince  chilies  and garlic finely and place in a mortar. Mash with
  the heel of a cleaver or pestle. Add sugar and stir until it
  dissolves. Add fish sauce, vinegar and lemon juice, stirring between
  each addition. This makes enough for  2-4  people.  I almost always
  double the recipe just to make sure there's enough. I've kept it for
  long periods of time but unless you freeze it, it's past it's prime
  after a few days.
  
  This  is  a  basic chili sauce used for a dip  for chicken or
  whatever. Variations of this are found in Cambodia, Thailand and
  other Southeast Asian countries. You can fiddle with it endlessly.
  This is a good starting point. The proportions shown here produce
  what I consider a mildly warm dip. I generally use two to six times
  as many chilies, depending on their strength and how hot I want it.
  
  Variations:  use  green serrano chilies instead  of dried red ones,
  lime juice  instead of the lemon juice or palm sugar instead of
  granulated. If you make it in a food processor, don't over process.
  It should have small chunks  of  each ingredient rather than being a
  homogeneous liquid.
  
  The  taste  is  sour and hot, very  puckery.  It's great with poached
  or steamed chicken, duck or game hens. Much better with basically
  bland dishes rather than something like curry which has it's own
  blend of spices. Good with  Chinese  white-cut chicken or Steamed
  Ginger Chicken with Black Bean sauce.  It's truly addictive and I
  often serve it with meals that are not Oriental  in origin. Should be
  good with a firm-fleshed white fish or boiled shrimp or crab.
  
  Fish  sauce is a liquid made with anchovies and salt. It's not really
  fishy tasting. Look for it in the oriental section of supermarkets or
  at markets catering to Asian clientele. Tiparos is a good brand made
  in the Philippines. I  prefer  Thai  or Vietnamese fish sauce, but
  they'll probably be harder to find.
  
  Another  trick  is to combine large quantities  of the liquid
  ingredients and store them in the fridge. Then, when you want some
  Nuoc Cham, just chop up the chilies and garlic, pound them with the
  sugar and add them to the liquid. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40

      Title: NUOC CHAM (VIETNAMESE CHILI SAUCE FOR DIPPING
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Dried red chilies
      2    Cloves garlic
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Fish sauce
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  The red stuff can be had in stores.  It comes in a clear plastic
  bottle with a green lid and a red rooster on the plastic. Or in
  smaller glass jars. It's called "Tuong ot toi Viet Nam" (tung ot toy)
  and is nothing more than red chiles mashed up with a bit of garlic.
  You could easily make it by smashing up a handful of the little red
  hot peppers and a couple of cloves of garlic in a mortar and pestle.
  There's a similar Filipino sauce called "Sambal Oeleck"++virtually
  the same but with the addition of vinegar. Here's my favorite recipe
  for nuoc cham. I have some variants if you'd like to see those too.
  I use it on a lot of stuff++it's very good with poached or white
  cooked chicken, thousand year eggs, shrimp chips.
  
  Mince chilies and garlic finely and place in a mortar. Mash with the
  heel of a cleaver or pestle.  Add sugar and stir until it dissolves.
  Add fish sauce, vinegar and lemon juice, stirring between each
  addition. This makes enough for 2 to 4 people.  I almost always
  double the recipe just to make sure there's enough. I've kept it for
  long periods of time but unless you freeze it, it's past it's prime
  after a few days.
  
  From "Great Asia Steambook" by Irene Wong.  Published by Taylor and
  Ng, distributed by Random House.  1977. ISBN 0-912738-11-1.
  
  This is a basic chili sauce used for a dip for chicken or whatever.
  Variations of this are found in Cambodia, Thailand and other Southeast
  Asian countries. You can fiddle with it endlessly. This is a good
  starting point. The proportions shown here produce what I consider a
  mildly warm dip. I generally use two to six times as many chilies,
  depending on their strength and how hot I want it.
  
  VARIATIONS:  Use green serrano chilies instead of dried red ones,
  thinly slice a red or green chili into rounds and toss them in, lime
  juice instead of the lemon juice or palm sugar instead of granulated.
  If you make it in a food processor, don't over process. It should
  have small chunks of each ingredient rather than being a homogeneous
  liquid. The taste is sour and hot, very puckery.  It's great with
  poached or steamed chicken, duck or game hens.  Much better with
  basically bland dishes rather than something like curry which has
  it's own blend of spices. Good with Chinese white-cut chicken or
  Steamed Ginger Chicken with Black Bean sauce. It's truly addictive
  and I often serve it with meals that are not Oriental in origin.
  Should be good with a firm- fleshed white fish or boiled shrimp or
  crab. Fish sauce is a liquid made with anchovies and salt. It's not
  really fishy tasting.  Look for it in the oriental section of
  supermarkets or at markets catering to Asian clientele. Tiparos is a
  good brand made in the Philippines.  I prefer Thai or Vietnamese fish
  sauce, but they'll probably be harder to find. A timesaver is to
  combine large quantities of the liquid ingredients and store them in
  the fridge. Then, when you want some Nuoc Cham, just chop up the
  chilies and garlic, pound them with the sugar and add them to the
  liquid.

      1    Fish Sauce Information
 
  Fish sauce is to Vietnamese cooking what salt is to Western and soy
  sauce to Chinese cooking.  It is included in practically all recipes.
  Prepared from fresh anchovies and salt, layered in huge wooden
  barrels, the manufacture of fish sauce is a major industry. The
  factories are located along the coast to assure the freshness of the
  fish to be processed. Fermentation is started once a year, during the
  fishing season. After about 3 months in the barrel, liquid drips from
  an open spigot, to be poured back into the top of the barrel.  After
  about 6 months the fish sauce is produced.
  
  The first draining is the very best fish sauce, lighter in color and
  perfectly clear.  [Kinda like "Extra Virgin" fish sauce. S.C.] It is
  relatively expensive and is reserved for table use. The second and
  third drainings yield a fish sauce of lower quality and lower cost
  for general- purpose cooking. The two towns most noted for their fish
  sauce are Phu Quoc and Phan Thiet.  Phu Quoc produces the best fish
  sauce, some of which is exported.  On the label, the "nhi" signifies
  the highest quality. When fish sauce manufactured in Vietnam is not
  available, that of Thailand or Hong Kong is quite acceptable.
  Philippine or Chinese fish sauce will not be satisfactory.  For table
  use and available in all Oriental groceries is Squid Brand Fish
  Sauce, the best one on the market. Whatever brand, look for the "Ca
  Com" on the label, which means that only anchovies were used++an
  indication of the highest quality for table use.

      Title: NUT TORTE
 Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Margarine
  2 1/4 c  Sugar
           Egg replacer
           -- (equivalent of 3 eggs)
      3 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 pn Salt
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    3/4 c  Soy milk, plain or vanilla
      2 c  Chopped walnuts or almonds
    1/2 c  Vegan marzipan
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
  
  To prepare the dough, cream the margarine with 3/4 cup sugar until
  fluffy. Add the egg replacer, lemon juice, and salt and mix well. Add
  the flour and baking powder, and mix until a soft dough is formed.
  
  Place two-thirds of the dough on a sheet of plastic wrap. With a
  rolling pin, roll the dough into a circle about 11 inches in
  diameter. Invert the dough into a 9-inch springform pan. Peel the
  plastic wrap off the dough and press the dough into the bottom and up
  the sides of the pan. Trim the edges if needed. Roll the remaining
  dough into a circle about 9 inches in diameter and set aside.  This
  will be used to top the torte.
  
  To prepare the filling, stir 1 cup of the sugar in a large heavy
  saucepan over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the
  heat and boil the sugar unti it turns a caramel color. Add the soy
  milk (which will bubble vigorously) along with the nuts and the rest
  of the sugar. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, for 5
  minutes. Remove from the heat and beat the marzipan into the mixture.
  When it is well mixed, pour it into the cake pan and put the
  rolled-out dough on top.
  
  Bake the torte until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cool completely
  before removing the springform.

      3 oz Flour
      8 tb Water
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs, dry
           Oil for deep frying
 
   Blanch whole cabbage leaves two at a time in enough boiling salted
  water to cover for about five minutes.
   Drain and cool in a colander.
  
   Meanwhile mix the cup of whole wheat bread crumbs with two
  tablespoons grated onion, and add one-half cup of boiling water. Let
  stand for five minutes to soften the bread crumbs. Then add the
  chopped nuts, the diced celery, the mixed herbs and spices.
  
   With a sharp knife, cut out the hard stem from each cabbage leaf.
  Lay the leaf flat on a working surface and spoon the filling onto the
  edge of the leaf. Coat the edge evenly, then roll it up tightly. If
  the cabbage leaves are small in size, take two leaves and arrange
  them so that one edge overlaps the other; line the leading edge with
  the filling and roll it up.
  
   In a bowl, combine the flour with 8 teaspoons of warm water. Beat
  them together until they form a thickish batter. Dip the cabbage
  rolls in the batter, then coat them with breadcrumbs and deep fry.
  
   Serve garnished with sprigs of parsley or mint.
  
   Serves four.

      Title: NUTRITIONAL YEAST & B12
 Categories: Digest, Feb95, Reference
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text Reference
 
  There's been some discussion of vitamin B12 in recent posts. A
  generally accepted assumption is that nutritional yeast is a source
  of B12. A little over a year ago, someone on the Fat-Free list
  mentioned that all nutritional yeasts are not fortified with B12,
  naming Red Star T-6635+ as one source. I asked my HFS if theirs had
  B12. "Absolutely", I was told. I asked to see the label of on the 50
  pound sack they use for their bulk sales, and there was no mention of
  B12 on it. After calling Red Star, I received a data sheet for all
  their nutritional yeasts. Of Red Star's yeasts, only T-6635+ contains
  a significant amount of B12 (0.5 mcg per gram). When I brought this
  to the attention of the general manager of the HFS, he immediately
  ordered the T-6635+ for all future shipments. While I had no
  immediate concern about a B12 deficiency, I had been consuming a
  nutritional yeast which added no B12 to my system.
  
  I noticed that the B12 fortified yeast was a much darker golden color
  than the ivory color of the the unfortified yeast, but that may vary
  from lot to lot.
  
  For what it's worth, the information sheet says that Red Star's
  primary grown nutritional yeasts are from a pure strain of
  Saccharomyces cervisiae, grown in a mixture of cane and beet
  molasses. (For those who remember their Latin, cervisiae would
  indicate a beer base.)
  
  A heaping tablespoon of nutritional yeast is about 8 grams. (4 mcg
  B12) This yeast is 4.7% fat, 35% carbohydrate and 52% protein, the
  rest is nitrogen and moisture. There are 2.8 calories of energy per
  gram.
  
  The complete nutritional analysis of T-6635+, including the specific
  amounts of each amino acid, is available from Universal Foods Corp.,

      Title: NUTTY RICE PUDDING (INDIA)
 Categories: Desserts, Rice
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           INGREDIENTS
    100 g  Rice
      4 c  Whole milk
    400 g  Sweetened condensed milk
           Chopped nuts like walnuts,
           Pistas, almonds
           Raisins (optional)
      1 pn Cardamom powder (optional)
 
  Heat 1 tsp butter in a cooking dish and fry the rice until pale golden
  brown. (I usually use Basmati rice for this, but you can use any
  rice) Once the rice has fried, add milk and cook and the rice. This
  will take 30 minutes, check and stir the rice and milk occasionally
  and be careful not to burn the bottom of the vessel ( a
  double-broiler works well here). After the rice is soft, add the
  condensed milk and cook for another 7-10 mins stirring constantly
  unti the pudding reaches the consistency you like best. Remove from
  fire and serve garnished with nuts, cardamom powder and raisins. The
  pudding can also be chilled and served cold. NOTES: If you like your
  pudding to be more sweet, add a couple of teaspoons of sugar to taste
  after you have added the condensed milk. Full-fat milk works best to
  get a creamy, thick pudding, if you are calorie and fat conscious,
  use skimmed milk to cook the rice. You can also use less or more of
  rice in your pudding according to your taste and preference.

      Title: OAKCAKES
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pt Mixed milk and water
      1 oz Yeast
      6 oz Fine oatmeal
      3 oz Plain flour
      1 ts Salt (or slightly less)
 
  Mix the flour, salt and oatmeal. Warm the liquid and stir in
  gradually to make a smooth batter. Crumble in the yeast, stir gently
  and leave to stand in a warm place for 20 mins. Stir again and cook
  in a stong, well greased frying pan. Pour in enough batter to cover
  the base fairly thinly and trun out when cooked.
  
  Remarks: This recipe is heavily adapted, but works. Traditionally the
  oat cakes were cooked on a `backstone' - a stone or iron sheet, over
  an open fire. It is still possible in some places in Yorkshire to buy
  a `girdle', a cast iron sheet, about 12 in diameter, with a hoop
  handle - these are ideal. When cooked, the oatcakes where hung on
  plain wooden rack suspended from the ceiling, known as bread fleaks.
  The oatcakes were eaten either fresh or dried.
  
  They can be fried with bacon, or suttered and eaten alone with cheese,
  treacle, golden syrup etc.

      Title: OAT & ONION TARTS
 Categories: 
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE PASTRY----------------------------
      5 oz Oat flakes (rolled oats) *
  2 1/2 oz Wholemeal flour
  2 1/2 oz Plain white flour
  2 1/2 oz Butter
  2 1/2 oz Lard
  2 1/2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
           Paprika & cayenne pepper

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
      1 lb Onions
    1/4 pt Soured cream
  2 1/2 oz Butter
  2 1/2 oz Cheddar cheese
      1    Whole egg
      1    Egg yolk
 
  *Note: Medium oatmeal may be used instead of oat flakes if preferred.
  
  Mix the oats, flours, cheese and a pinch each of salt, paprika and
  cayenne. Cut then rub in the fat, bind with water and leave out to
  rest.
  
  Peel, quarter and slice the onions wafer thin.  Turn them in melted
  butter, cover and leave to sweat over very gentle heat for 20 minutes
  or so until meltingly tender, just stirring occasionally.
  
  This pastry is rather difficult to handle so it is best to divide it
  in half and roll out in two batches. Keep the other half covered
  meanwhile. Use the pastry to line little mincepie tins (or individual
  4-inch fluted flan tins if you prefer).  Don't worry too much if the
  pastry tears; patch it together by pressing it with your fingertips.
  Blind bake on a pre-heated baking sheet at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6,
  allowing 12 minutes with greaseproof paper and beans, then 12 minutes
  without the lining.
  
  When the onions are beautifully soft, remove the lid and cook over
  increased heat for several minutes until they are a rich golden brown.
  Season generously with salt and black pepper, add a dash of cayenne
  and paprika and mix well.  Then tip the contents of the pan into a

      Title: OAT & ONION TARTS
 Categories: British, Cheese/eggs, Harned 1994, Main dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE PASTRY----------------------------
      5 oz Oat flakes (rolled oats)*
  2 1/2 oz Whole meal flour
  2 1/2 oz Plain white flour
  2 1/2 oz Butter
  2 1/2 oz Lard
  2 1/2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
      1 pn Salt
      1 pn Paprika
      1 pn Cayenne pepper

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
      1 lb Onions
           Salt and pepper; to taste
      1 ds Each cayenne and paprika
    1/4 pt Sour cream
  2 1/2 oz Butter
  2 1/2 oz Cheddar cheese
      1    Whole egg + 1 egg yolk
 
  *Note: Medium oatmeal may be used instead of oat flakes if preferred.
  
  Mix the oats, flours, cheese and the salt, paprika and cayenne. Cut
  then rub in the fat, bind with water and leave out to rest.
  
  Peel, quarter and slice the onions wafer thin.  Turn them in melted
  butter, cover and leave to sweat over very gentle heat for 20 minutes
  or so until meltingly tender, just stirring occasionally.
  
  This pastry is rather difficult to handle so it is best to divide it
  in half and roll out in two batches. Keep the other half covered
  meanwhile. Use the pastry to line little mincepie tins (or individual
  4 " fluted flan tins if you prefer).  Don't worry too much if the
  pastry tears; patch it together by pressing it with your fingertips.
  
  Bake on a pre-heated baking sheet at 400 F., allowing 12 minutes with
  greaseproof paper and beans, then 12 minutes without the lining.
  
  When the onions are beautifully soft, remove the lid and cook over
  increased heat for several minutes until they are a rich golden brown.
  Season generously with salt and pepper, add dashes of cayenne and
  paprika and mix well. Then tip the contents of the pan into a sieve
  placed over a bowl to drain off the buttery juices and to cool the
  onions slightly.
  
  When pastry cases are cooked, beat the eggs with the soured cream, add
  onions and check seasoning.  Spoon the mixture into the tarts,
  sprinkle the grated cheese on top and bake at 400 F. for 20-25
  minutes, until the filling is deliciously puffed up and golden.

      Title: OAT BRAN SQUARES
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 55 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Oat bran
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Baking soda
      4 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
      1 ts Honey
    1/4 c  Hot water
 
  "Oat bran is a good source of fiber. These crackers are not only
  healthy, they also taste good. They are worthy of a large glass of
  freshly-squeezed orange juice.
  
  325~ F      18 to 22 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~ F.
  
  Combine the oat bran, flour, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl or
  in the food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal.
  
  Dissolve the honey in the hot water and blend it into the flour
  mixture. If the dough is too wet for rolling, quickly add a little
  more flour.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll to about 1/8 inch. With a sharp knife,
  cut the dough into 2-inch squares. Place them on a lightly greased or
  parchment-lined baking sheet. Prick each square in 2 or 3 places with
  the tines of a fork. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes, or until medium
  brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 50-55.
  
  VARIATIONS: Substitute wheat bran for oat bran. For a more delicate
  cracker, roll the dough thinner and reduce the baking time to
  compensate.

      Title: OAT FARLS
 Categories: Bread/rolls, Ireland
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Rolled oats; (not instant)
  2 1/4 c  Buttermilk
  2 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
 
  Recipe by: From Celtic Hearths The day before serving, mix the oats
  with 1-1/4 cups of the buttermilk in a bowl. Cover and let stand
  overnight at room temperature. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly
  grease a baking sheet and set aside. Sift together the flour, salt
  and baking soda. Gradually beat the flour mixture into the
  oat-buttermilk mixture, adding remaining buttermilk as you work, to
  form a soft dough. You may not need to use the full 2-1/4 cups
  buttermilk. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and flatten with
  hands or floured rolling pin so that it forms a circle about 1 inch
  thick and 9 to 10-inches in diameter. With a sharp knife, cut into
  quarters or eighths, as desired, and place on prepared baking sheet.
  Bake for 40 minutes, or until browned. Serve warm. Note: These are
  high in fiber and low in fat, provided you don't slather th with
  butter. Delicious with jam or marmalade. Yield: 8 servings.

        1    large onion diced
      1/2    Tbs garlic powder
      1/2    Tbs Italian seasoning
     4 1/2 Cups old fashioned rolled oats.
  
  Bring to a boil all ingredients except the oats. (I use a 3 quart
  pot, why do you ask?) Turn heat to low and stir in 4 1/2 cups rolled
  oats. Cook for about 5-10 minutes until the water is absorbed. Don't
  overcook. Not a major warning here, but if it is too soupy, add some
  oats at about 5 minutes and cook for a few more minutes instead of
  cooking it longer. I haven't had to add any oats the last 5 or 10
  times I've made this). Fill a rectangular non-stick baking pan with
  the mixture (we are making square burgers here, a lot easier than
  forming little circles). Your pan should be anywhere from 9x18 or
  larger. Depends upon how thick you want them. I like them about 1/2
  of an inch thick. I wouln't make them any thinner, because they'll be
  tough and will dry out . (Note: I wrote everything down but the pan
  size when I made these the last time, and I usually fill one or two
  of whatever is clean. You may need two pans. Sorry.) Total cooking
  time is 45 minutes. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes. Then use a utensil
  that won't scratch your pan to cut the giant burger into little
  burgers, and flip them. Cook another 20 minutes. Taste great hot or
  cold.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 20 Servings

    1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms; diced
    1/4 c  Oil
  4 1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 ts Dried basil
    1/4 c  Nutritional yeast
    1/2 ts Seasalt
    1/3 c  Soy sauce
    1/4 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Thyme
      5 c  Old fashioned
 
                                                  rolled oats
  
  Saute the first four ingredients in a covered saucepan. While they are
  sauteeing, bring to a boil all the other ingredients except the oats.
  Lower heat, add the sauteed vegetables, and add the oats, one cup at
  a time, sallowing each cupful to sink a little before stirring
  gently. Cook up to five minutes--until mixture starts to stick to
  bottom of pot. Set aside to cool. It's much easier to form the
  patties if the mixture has cooled at least 10-15 minutes. Form into
  patties, place on oiled cookie sheet, bake at 350 degrees for about
  45 minutes. Turn once after about 20 minutes. Makes about 20- 25
  burgers. Oatburgers lend themselves to many variations. Some further
  suggestions are dill, parsley, celery, green or red peppers in
  placeof the mushrooms. (From _Vegetarian Cooking for a Better World_,

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 oz Medium oatmeal*
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 pn Bicarbonate of soda
      2 tb Melted bacon fat**
      2 fl Hot water***
 
  *Grinding down regular rolled oats slightly in a blender or grinder
  will be a help.  **Or beef dripping. ***Approximately. -- Mix the
  oatmeal, salt and soda in a bowl.  Make a well in the center.  Pour
  in the melted fat and add enough water to make a stiff dough which
  can be squeezed into a ball. Sprinkle the board and your hands with
  oatmeal and knead the mixture until there are no cracks in it.
  Flatten the ball and roll it out into a round just under 1/4 inch
  thick. Invert a plate on top and trim off the ragged edges -- these
  can be added to the next batch of dough to be rolled. Cut the round
  into quarters, lift them onto a warmed and greased bakestone and cook
  over moderate heat for 20 minutes or until the triangles curl at the
  corners.  Turn and cook the other side for 5 minutes, or finish under
  a moderate grill.  Store the oatcakes in an airtight tin, and toast
  under a moderate grill, or in the oven, before serving.  -- These are
  served with honey, marmalade or jam for breakfast, or with crowdie (a
  slightly sweet Highland Scots cottage cheese) for tea. They are
  especially good with fried herring or smoked haddock.  Not to mention
  any kind of caviar you can get your hands on.

  take a few secounds to turn colour.
  :       Set the oven to 375F/Gas 5 or heat a gridle or heavy
  frying-pan. Mix the oatmeal, the bicarbonated of soda and salt
  together in a bowl. Add the melted fat and the hot water. Stir well
  until it makes a soft paste. Sprinkle some oatmeal on a board. From
  the dough into a round and roll it out as thinly as possible, adding
  oatmeal to the serface as necessary, to prevent sticking. Brush off
  the excess oatmeal. Cut the dough into 4 or 6 pieces. To oven bake;
  place on a large ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes. To
  gridle bake; bake on a hot gridle or frying-pan until the edges begin
  to curl. Turn over and cook the other side. Do not let the oatcakes
  brown; they should be a pale fawn colour. Put on a wire rack to cool.
  They are delicious served with cheese. :

      4 oz Oatmeal
      1 ts Fat
           ;Water, hot
      1 pn Salt
      1 pn Baking soda
 
  As the dough stiffens when lying about, it is best to make a bannock
  at a time, using the above quantities, the next being prepared whilst
  the one is on the girdle [not a typo!].
  
  Put the oatmeal into a bowl and add the salt and soda. Melt a
  teaspoon of dripping or fat (bacon fat, goose fat, or poultry fat are
  all excellent). Make a well in the centre of the meal, put in the
  dripping, and add as much hot water as will make a stiff paste.  Rub
  plenty of oatmeal on to the baking board; turn out the mixture and
  form into a smooth ball. Knead and roll out as thinly as possible.
  Rub constantly on both sides with dry meal to prevent sticking, and
  keep the edges as even as possible by pinching wit finger and thumb.
  Give a final rub with meal, cut into a round, using a plate, and then
  cut the bannock into farls (fardels or quarters) or into smaller
  pieces. Place on a moderately hot girdle and bake steadily till th
  cakes curl up at the edge; then toast the other side slightly before
  a clea fire or finish in the oven.
  
  If you have neither a girdle nor a thick-bottomed frying-pan, you may
  bake the oatcakes in a moderate over for 20-30 minutes, till quite
  dry and curle at the edges.
  
  Buttered oatcakes are particularly good with marmalade, honey,
  cheese, frie herrings, and sardines.

 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Quick oats
      2 c  Boiling water
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 pk (1*scant*Tablespoon) yeast
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Warm water
      1 tb Salt
      5 c  White flour
 
  Combine oats, whole wheat flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, and
  pour the boiling water over it.  Stir to combine.
  
  Meanwhile, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.
  
  When the oat mixture is lukewarm, add the yeast.  Stir in the white
  flour, cup by cup.
  
  When dough is stiff enough to handle, turn onto floured board and
  knead 5-10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, cover, and let rise until
  doubled. Punch down and let rise again. Shape into 2 loaves and place
  in greased 9x5x3" pans.  Bake at 350 F for 30-40 minutes. Cool on
  rack.
  
  [Notes:  This originally called for 2 T. margarine to be added to the
  initial oat mixture.  Oil is unnecessary in bread, but it does delay
  staleness.  I usually use half white flour and half wheat. This bread
  is VERY good, and makes great toast.]

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
  1 1/2 c  Rolled oats (oatmeal)
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      6 tb (3/4 stick) butter or
           -Margarine, melted and
           -Cooled
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  Preheat the oven to 325~ F. "Crunchy and nutty, these crackers make a
  nutritious snack. Put your feet up after a hard day's work and enjoy
  a few with a glass of fresh lemonade.
  
  325~ F      20 to 25 minutes
  
  Stir together the flour, oats, salt, and sugar in a large bowl or in
  the food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal. Blend in enough of the milk to form a dough that will
  hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divid the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll as thin as possible, to about 1/16 inch
  thick. Using a spatula, rolling pin, or your hands, transfer the
  rolled dough gently onto a large baking sheet.
  
  With a sharp knife, score the dough into 2-inch squares without
  cutting all the way throug the dough. Prick each square 2 or 3 times
  with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, turning over after 15 minutes, until
  crisp. Cool on a rack. Break into individual crackers when cool.

    2/3 c  Brown sugar
      1    Egg white

      1 pk Yeast

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/3 c  Brown sugar
      1 tb Cinnamon
      1 tb Vanilla
 
  Stir the warm milk and oatmeal together and let it sit for about 15
  min. Stir in the yeast till dissolved and let this sit for another 15
  min. Beat the egg while a bit first to break it up and stir it in,
  too. Also add the sugar and salt.  Beat this very well for about 5
  min. Now start to add unbleached white flour (I use 'bread' flour,
  but it isn't strickly neccessary). Beat in as much as you can by
  hand, then turn the dough our onto a flour-dusted counter and knead,
  addd flour as neccessary. Be careful not to add too much, or the
  bread will be dry. This is a sticky dough and a dough-scaper or
  spatula will be helpful in scaping it off the counter while kneading.
  Knead for more than 5 min. Dump the dough back into the bowl (no need
  to wash it or 'grease' it!) and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let
  the dough rise till double (the time will depend on whether you use
  regular or fast rising yeast- should be about 1 h for regular and
  30min for fast rising).
  
  Scrape the dough out onto the counter again and give it a few kneads.
  Flour the counter will and shape the dough into a regular shaped
  rectangle and use a floured rolling pin the roll it out. Roll the
  short side to match your loaf pan width and roll it as 'long' as you
  want. Spread the sugar and cinnamon over the drizzle the vanilla over
  it all. Roll it up and make sure there is no sugar over the last inch
  or so, so the dough seals. Strech dough over the open ends, so the
  sugar doesn't leak out and place the dough in a 'pam' sprayed large
  loaf pan (9X5?). Cover it with plastic wrap that has been sprayed
  with 'pam' and let it rise till just over the top of the pan.  Bake
  in a 350 F oven for about 35-40 min.

 Categories: Cookies, No-bake
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
      3 c  Rolled oats
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Nuts, chopped (optional)
      2 c  Sugar, granulated
    1/2 c  Cocoa powder
    1/2 c  Evaporated milk
    1/4 lb Butter
 
  Combine oats, vanilla and nuts in a bowl and set aside.
  
  Combine sugar, cocoa and evaporated milk in a heavy, 2-quart sauce
  pan. Bring to a full rolling boil over medium-high heat, STIRRING
  CONSTANTLY. Let boil, while stirring, for 2 minutes.
  
  Remove pan from heat and add the butter.  Stir until butter is melted
  and incorporated.  Quickly add oat mixture to pan and stir until well
  mixed.
  
  Drop by the spoonful onto waxed paper.  Let cool for 2 hours to set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  No-bake chocolate oatmeal cookies -- This may be my all-time
  favorite cookie recipe.  I don't remember where I got this particular
  version of the recipe but I remember my great-aunt making these
  cookies for us as kids.
  
  *  My great-aunt never put nuts in these cookies.  I like nuts but I
  find that they get lost in the recipe. If you want the oats to be less
  prominent, use quick-cooking oats. They will fall apart somewhat in
  the final mixing.
  
  *  A heavy sauce pan makes burning the fudge less likely but stir,
  stir, stir, anyway.
  
  *  The cooking time at boil is important.  Cooked too little the
  cookies will not set; too much and they start to harden before you
  get them out of the pan.
  
  *  These cookies are better the next day, if there are any left.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation and cooking, 2 hours cooling.

      Title: OATMEAL HONEY BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      2 c  Oatmeal, uncooked
           -(e.g., Quaker's Old
           -Fashioned Oatmeal)
    2/3 c  Honey
      2 tb Salt
      3 tb Butter (or margarine)
      1 c  Water, boiling
      2 pk Yeast (dry), active
      1 c  Water, lukewarm
    2/3 c  Milk
      5 c  Flour, unbleached
           -(up to 6 C; may
           -substitute up to 2 C
           -whole wheat)
           Oil
 
  Put the oatmeal, honey, salt and butter in a large mixing bowl. Add
  boiling water and mix together. Let stand for 45 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Following the yeast package directions, add the yeast to lukewarm
  water, and let it soften for about 5 minutes. Add the yeast mixture
  to the oats and honey mixture. Mix in the milk and stir well.
  
  Stir in the flour, 1/2 cup at a time.  When the dough is too stiff to
  stir, pour it out onto a well-floured surface and knead it firmly,
  adding a little flour if necessary. Knead it until the dough is
  smooth and elastic (about 6-8 minutes). Form the dough into a ball.
  Place the dough into a large greased bowl, coating the entire ball of
  dough.
  
  Cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm, cozy, humid place. (I
  put it in a cool oven, with a small saucepan of hot tap water sitting
  on the bottom of the oven.) Let rise for about 1 1/2 hours, or until
  the dough has doubled in bulk.
  
  Punch down the dough and split in half.  Spread the dough into two
  greased loaf pans, coating the dough as before, and cover with a damp
  cloth, and let rise for about an hour in a warm, cozy, humid place.
  
  Bake at 350 F for 35-40 minutes, or until loaves sound hollow when
  tapped. Cool on a bread rack for about ten minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A yeast bread for people who like oatmeal.  Yield: makes 2 loaves.
  
  *  Kneading is difficult to describe in words, but many cookbooks have
  pictures.  The idea is to exercise the dough and work some more flour
  into it. Bread freezes very well; give it an hour or so to thaw, then
  heat it up at 350 degrees F. for about ten minutes.
  
  *  Instant and quick-cooking oatmeal is not satisfactory in this
  recipe. Besides the ubiquitous Quaker oats, you can use any
  commercial rolled oats or steel-cut oats. If you use the steel-cut
  oats, then soak for 1 hour in step 1.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you already know how to knead dough, moderate
  otherwise.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 4 1/2 hours waiting time.
  : Precision:  All amounts (including times) are approximate.

  2 1/2 ts Yeast
      1 c  Oatmeal
      2 c  Bread flour

    1/4 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
      1 ts Cinnamon
 
  You can add the raisins and nuts at the beginning of the cycle or at
  the "beeps"  You may need to add more water. Here in AZ I have to add
  a couple more tablespoons of water when the weather is very dry. If
  the machine seems to strain to knead the dough, add a little more
  water. Use the sweet bread cycle, as the sugar and raisins make the
  crust brown quickly. I put a piece of foil on top to brown the top
  crust a bit more.

      Title: OATMEAL-RYE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  2 1/2 c  Warm water (110'F.)
      1 tb Sugar
      2 c  Rye flour
  5 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Regular rolled oats
    1/3 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
      1 ts Salt
           Butter or margarine (opt)
 
  Omar Khayyam, whose paradise required only a book of verses, a loaf of
  bread, and a jug of wine, might have suffered seriously from
  malnutrition (along with the mysterious Thou, who sang beside him) if
  the loaf were the bubble bread we are all familiar with. Although
  this flabby loaf contains niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, and a rich
  assortment of mono- and diglycerides (ethoxylated and otherwise), it
  is not especially rich in protien and fiber, two pillars of
  contemporary sound diet.
  =======================================================
  ==================
  1. The night before, sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large (at
  least 4-quart) bowl and let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Then add
  granulated sugar and rye flour; beat to blend well. Cover bowl
  tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature up to a
  day (at least 12 hours). Stir in 5 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, rolled
  oats, brown sugar, and salt.
  2. TO KNEAD BY HAND, scrape dough onto a board lightly coated with
  all-purpose flour. Knead, adding flour as required to prevent
  sticking, until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place
  dough in a greased bowl, turn over to grease top, and cover with
  plastic wrap.
  3. TO KNEAD WITH A DOUGH HOOK, beat until dough pulls cleanly from
  bowl. If dough still feels sticky, beat in flour, 1 tablespoon at a
  time; remove dough hook and cover bowl with plastic wrap.
  4. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch
  down and divide into 3 equal portions. Shape each portion into a loaf
  and set in a greasd 4x8" loaf pan. Cover loaves lightly and let rise
  in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. With a sharp
  knife or razor blade, slash top of each loaf in about 3 places,
  making cuts about 1/8" deep. Brush tops lightly with water.
  5. Bake in a 350'F. oven; after 10 minutes, brush tops lightly with
  more water. Continue baking until loaves are well browned, about 40
  minutes total. For a shiny finish, rub tops of hot loaves with soft
  butter. Invert onto racks. Serve warm or cool. If loaves are made
  ahead, cool and package airtight up to a day; freeze to store longer.
  Make 3 loaves, each about 1
      1/2    pounds.

      2 lg Chickens (about 3 1/2 lbs
           -each), cut into
           Serving pieces, or 1 7-pound
           -turkey
      2 sm Heads of garlic, scored
           -around the middle
      2 sm White onions, roughly sliced
      6    Fresh mint sprigs
           Sea salt to taste
           The sauce:
    1/4 lb Chilhuacles negros or
           -guajillos
      2 oz Chilies pasillas (Mexican,
           -not Oaxacan)
      2 oz Chilies mulatos
    1/2 lb (about 1 large) tomatoes,
           -broiled
      1 c  Water
      3    Whole cloves
      3    Whole allspice
      6    Fresh thyme sprigs, leaves
           -only, or 1/4 tsp dried
      2 tb Oaxacan or 1 Tbsp Mexican
           -oregano
    3/4 c  Melted lard or safflower oil
    1/4 c  Sesame seed
    1/4 c  Shelled peanuts
     10    Unskinned almonds
    1/4 c  Raisins
      1 sm Onion, thickly sliced
      1    Ripe plantain, skinned and
           -cut into thick slices
      2    Crisp-fried corn tortillas
      3    Thick slices dried French
           -bread or semisweet roll
      2 oz Tablet Mexican drinking
           -chocolate
           Sea salt to taste
 
  The Chicken:
  
  Put the chicken into a saucepan with the garlic, onions, and mint. Add
  water to cover and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer, cover the pan,
  and continue simmering until the chicken is just tender - about 35
  minutes. Strain, reserving the broth.
  
  Remove stems from the dried chilies, if any, slit them open, and
  remove seeds and veins, reserving the seeds. Toast the chilies for
  about 50 seconds on each side; if you're using guajillos, toast them
  longer, until they are almost charred - about 2 minutes. Rinse the
  chilies in cold water, cover with hot water, and leave to soak for
  about 30 minutes. Put the reserved chile seeds into an ungreased
  frying pan and toast over fairly high heat, shaking them around from
  time to time so that they brown evenly. Then raise the heat and char
  until black. Cover with cold water and set aside to soak for about 5
  minutes.  Strain and put into a blender jar.
  
  Add the broiled tomatoes, unpeeled, to the blender jar along with the
  water, cloves, allspice, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
  
  Heat some of the lard in a small frying pan and fry the sesame seed
  until a deep golden color - a few seconds. Strain, putting the fat
  back into the pan and the seeds into the blender jar, and blend as
  smooth as possible.
  
  Fry the rest of the ingredients, except the chilies and chocolate,
  one by one, strain, and put into the blender jar, blending after each
  addition and adding water or broth as necessary to release the blades.
  
  heat 1/4 cup of the lard in the heavy pan in which you are going to
  cook the mole, add the blended mixture, and fry over medium heat,
  stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time, for
  about 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, put a few of the chilies and about 2 cups of the water in
  which they were soaking into the blender jar and blend until smooth.
  When you have blended all the chilies, add them to the fried
  ingredients together with the chocolate and cook for 5 minutes
  longer. Add about 4 cups of the chicken broth and continue cooking
  for 35 minutes. (Skim the fat that forms on the top if you are going
  to make tamales or mole. It is added to color and flavor the masa.)
  Add more broth if necessary - the mole should just coat the back of a
  wooden spoon - along with the chicken and salt to taste; cook for 10
  minutes longer.

  The octopus must be very carefully washed and dried, and the mouth
  removed. Cover the bottom of a saucepan with oil; add the rosemary,
  bay leaf oregano, cumin seeds, parley, chili pepper, tomatoes and
  chopped garlic. Place the octopus on top of this mixture and season
  with salt and pepper. Cover the pot very tightly and simmer for about
  45 minutes. Cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water
  until it is 'al dente' (firm to the bite). Drain and turn onto a warm
  serving dish. Mix the octopus sauce into the spaghetti. Serve piping
  hot. NOTE: I used cleaned fresh squid from the fish counter...easier
  and cheaper!

      Title: OCTOPUS SALAD
 Categories: Australian, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  Ain't a bit of squid here!  Instead we fall back on the squid's
  digitally impaired cousin, the octopus... The author of the original
  article, Meryl Constance, cautions buyers to make sure that the
  octopi one buys are pre-tenderized.  She notes that traditional
  Australian methods for tenderizing octopi include using rocks,
  bricks, cement mixers and even washing machines. (No kiddin'!)
  
  Raw Materials first encountered this salad in Argentina, where it
  could be bought from top-flight delicatessen counters for an instant
  picnic. The pink of the octopus pieces with the green of the herbs
  makes this a very pretty salad.
  
  Prepare a 2 to 3 kg octopus and precook it.  [See note below. S.C.]
  
  While it is cooking, whisk together in a glass bowl 300 mL good olive
  oil, the juice of 1 or 2 lemons (taste and stop when the balance is
  right), salt, pepper and generous amounts of finely chopped garlic,
  shallots, chives and parsley.  The dressing should be thick with the
  herbs. When the octopus is tender, drain it, cut it up into generous
  chunks and, while it is still warm, fold it into the dressing.  Serve
  the salad at room temperature, with plenty of crusty bread.
  
  NOTE:  Chances are if you buy your cephalopod in a supermar-ket in
  the US it will already be cooked.  If not, follow these steps from
  earlier in the article...
  
  "Cut through the head/body above and below the eyes. Discard this
  section. Slit the back of the head and turn it inside out, discarding
  all the contents (unless you want to keep the ink sac for a
  particular recipe). Push the beak (in the center of the star of
  tentacles) through and out...Skinning is quite unnecessary and very
  fiddly. If you prefer to do so, it is much easier after cooking than
  before.
  
  A large octopus needs precooking for many dishes.  Put it in a
  saucepan and just cover with lightly salted water. Simmer gently
  until the point of a knife slides easily into the meat++maybe one
  hour, maybe longer.
  
  The deep mauve stock which results need not be discarded when you
  drain the octopus.  It is very rich (in fact, it will often set to a
  jelly in the fridge) and makes a wonderful soup..."
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings.

  Materials". 3/2/93.  Courtesy, Mark Herron.

      Title: OCTOPUS SPANISH STYLE
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lg (or four small) tentacles
     15 oz Tomato sauce
    1/2 sm Onion, chopped
      1 ts Chili powder
           Pepper and garlic to taste
 
  Beat tentacles to tenderize.  Boil for about 20 minutes in salted
  water. Slice.  Heat frying pan and just enough fat to cover the
  bottom. Fry onion. Add tomato, chili powder, pepper, garlic powder,
  and let simmer one-half hour.  Then add sliced octopus and simmer for
  another hour. Serve over fresh cooked rice.

      Title: OCTOPUS TIDBITS
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Octopus meat
      2    Eggs
      2 ts Dill weed
      2 tb Finely chopped onion
    1/2 c  Breadcrumbs
    1/4 c  Melted butter
           -OR- margarine
 
  Boil fresh octopus for at least 10 minutes. Remove skin. The skin and
  suckers will "slip" off the tentacles when it is cooked. Prepare
  cooked octopus for tidbits by grinding as you would hamburger. Once
  is sufficient. No further tenderizing is necessary. Mix ingre- dients
  together. Form into balls no larger than 1" in diameter. Roll in
  bread crumbs to coat. Pan fry in butter or margarine until golden
  brown. Garnish with lemon, lime, tomatoes or lettuce.
  
  These delicious tidbits are wonderful for fancy buffets, freeze well,
  and make a hit at any and every party. Great for the gourmet, and
  good for home. It is difficult to say how many this serves, as some
  people love it and gobble them all up, and others only eat a few if
  they know what they are eating. For a main meal, it should serve four.

      Title: OCTOPUS WITH GARLIC - POLIPI VERACI ALL'AGLIO
 Categories: Seafood, Italian, Garlic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Octopus (about 1 1/2 pounds
           -each)
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      5    Cloves garlic, crushed
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Cumin seeds
           Salt
      1 sm Green pepper, chopped
 
  rosemary leaves and parsley
  
  Cut out the eyes and mouth of the octopus. Remove the ink sac and
  internal bone. Cut off the tough points in the tentacles. Put each
  octopus on a board and beat them well to break the fibers and make
  the meat more tender. Wash them in running water until they are very
  white; do not dry but put them in an earthen- ware dish and season
  with oil, flavored with garlic, bay leaf and cumin seeds. Cover the
  dish tightly with a sheet of waxed paper or foil tied around the top
  with string. Put the dish over a very low heat between 1 and 2 hours,
  according to the size of the octopus. When they are tender, drain
  them, season with additional oil, salt, green pepper, rosemary leaves
  and parsley. Serve in a tureen.

  It doesn't make reference to it in the text, but in the pictures of
  both these dishes, it shows one or two largish octopi garnished with
  reseattes of baby octopi tentacles. I imagine you'd do quite well
  using the 'baby' octopi like those I see sold around here in the
  supermarkets, or even with squid.

      Title: OEN CYMREIG MELOG
 Categories: Lamb, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lb Leg of lamb
      2 tb Rosemary
      2 ts Ground ginger
      1 c  Light honey
  1 1/2 c  Apple cider
           Salt and pepper
 
      Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Grease a raosting pan. Sprinkle
  the lamb with salt, pepper, ginger and rosemary. Place it in the
  roasting pan. Spoon 2/3 cup of honey over teh top. Pour 1 cup of
  cider around the lamb in the pan.  Mix the remaining honey and cider
  in a small bowl. Use it to baste the meat frequently.
  
      Place the roasting pan in the oven and reduce the heat to 400
  degrees F.  Cook the meat to taste, using an oven thermometer. Rare
  meat will register 140 degrees, and take about 12 minutes for each
  pound. Well-done meat will register 175 degrees and take about 18
  minutes for each pound. When meat is cooked as you like it, transfer
  it to a serving platter. Pour the pan juices into a small pitcher and
  serve with the meat as a gravy.

      Title: OEUF BROUILLES A LA MICHEL GUERARD
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Breakfast
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      4 lg Eggs
      2 ts Butter
      1 tb Creme fraiche
      4 tb Finely chopped shallots
      1 ts Finely chopped chives
           Salt and pepper
      2 oz Caviar
      8    Long thin pieces of bread
           - toasted
 
  CUT EACH EGG SHELL about 1/2-inch from its pointed end with a serrated
  knife (surgical scissors work well too). Pour out the insides into a
  bowl. Wash the tops and shells in warm water, then turn them upside
  down on a towel to dry completely. Over very low heat melt the butter
  in a saucepan just large enough to hold the eggs. Beat the eggs with
  a whisk, pour through a sieve into the warm butter and return to the
  very low heat. Beat constantly with the whisk, gradually increasing
  the heat, until the eggs are thick and creamy, but not solid. Remove
  the eggs immediately from the heat and continue whisking while adding
  the creme fraiche, shallots, chives, salt and pepper. Place the dried
  eggshells in egg cups (or in a mound of coarse salt on a plate).
  Using a teaspoon, carefully fill each shell 3/4 full with the creamed
  eggs, then finish filling each shell with a tablespoon of caviar.
  Replace the tops of the shells or garnish with some long stalks of
  chives, if you wish. Serve with toast.

 Categories: Eggs, Brunch, Main dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Eggs; boiled for 4 minutes
     75 g  Peas, cooked
     75 g  Asparagus, cooked
     25 g  Sunflower margarine; melted
      5 tb Bchamel sauce
           A little single cream
           Salt and pepper
           Parsley sprigs to garnish
 
  A sauce of pured peas and asparagus is the coating for soft-boiled
  eggs in this recipe. Lovely summery food, best served with rice and a
  tossed salad - and some warm, fresh bread on the side.
  
  Plunge the boiled eggs into cold water as soon as the four minutes
  are up. When they are cold, peel very carefully, making sure not to
  break the white. Pure the peas and the asparagus together with the
  melted margarine and bchamel - the pure should be smooth and a
  lovely shade of green. Thin out with a little single cream and season
  to taste. Divide the mixture into the bottom of two ramekin dishes.
  Put the eggs on top and garnish with a sprig of parsley. Serve at
  room temperature.

 Categories: German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    500 g  Flour (4 1/2 cups less 1
           -Tbsp)
      1 ds Salt
     40 g  [fresh] yeast (1.4 oz)
     80 g  Sugar (1/3 cup plus 1 tsp)
      1    To 2 eggs
     70 g  Butter (1/3 cup less 1 tsp)
    1/8 l  Milk (1/2 cup plus 1/2 Tbsp)
           Filling:
    500 g  Apples, damson plums, or
           -pitted cherries (a generous
           Lb)
           Sugar to taste (nowadays
           -also vanilla sugar)
           A little cinnamon (with
           -apples or damson plums)
    400 g  Butter or clarified butter
           -(1 3/4 cups) for baking
 
  Yeast dough:
  
  Dissolve the yeast and some sugar in a bit of warmed milk. Mound the
  flour on a pastry board.  Make a well in the middle of the mound, and
  into it pour the yeast mixture. Let rest for about 1/2 hour. Then add
  the remaining ingredients - sugar, eggs, salt, butter, and milk.
  Knead to mix well, and beat until the dough forms bubbles. Cover the
  dough with an inverted bowl and let rise, in a warm place, for 1 1/2
  hours.  Then cut off lumps of dough, and let those rise one more
  time, on the floured pastry board, for another 1/2 hour. With your
  hands, stretch each piece of dough and cover with fruit (one kind
  only).  If you are using apples or damson plums, dust fruit with
  cinnamon and sugar, otherwise just with sugar. Fold the dough over to
  enclose the fruit and arrange the dumplings in a baking dish with a
  buttered bottom (3 1/2 Tbsp butter per dumpling) . Bake at medium
  heat for 35 to 40 minutes, until light brown. Remove from oven and
  tip onto a board for cooling.  Brush with melted butter shortly
  before cooling.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: OGTZFAK
 Categories: Desserts, Hungary
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
      2 ea Tb brandy
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 lb Butter or margerine
      1 ts Baking powder
      3 ea Eggs
      2 ea To 3lb hrtnng .milk
           Powdered sugar
 
  Cream the butter (margerine) and sugar.  Add the eggs, milk, brandy,
  salt, and baking powder. Gradually add the flour until the dough is
  not sticky. Put dough on a board and knead in any remaining flour.
  Wrap in plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for a few hours or
  overnight.... makes it MUCH easier to roll. Cut dough into small
  sections, covering all but the one you are working on. Roll dough out
  to 1/16" thickness. Cut out pieces about 3. " to 4" long and about
  1-1/2" wide. Make a slit about 1-1/2" long down the center of each
  piece and pull one end through the slit so that the sides twist.
  Deep fry about six pieces at a time until golden in color and drain
  on paper towels. Avoid the urge to speed things up by doing more at
  one time... you will only cool the shortening too fast and end up
  with a heavier, less crisp result. Sprinkle lavishly with powdered
  sugar when cool.  Enjoy! By the way, the brandy is important for more
  than just flavoring.  When the pieces of dough hit the hot
  shortening, the brandy vaporizes and forces its way out of the dough,
  preventing shortening from getting in, making for a much lighter
  result. As you can guess, this gets pretty frantic with only one
  person doing it; for best results, and more fun, work with a friend,
  one person rolling and cutting, the other person frying. OGTZFAK

 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Arrowroot Powder
 
  The best substitute for the oil seems to be a tablespoon of arrowroot
  mixed in a couple cups of water and boiled until it thickens to
  oil-like consistency.  (I got the "arrowroot for oil" substitution
  from Graham Kerr.)

 Categories: Russian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Meat, cooked
      1    Cucumber
      2    Eggs, hard-boiled
      3    Onions, green
      1 ts Sugar
      2 ts Dijon mustard
    1/2 c  Sour cream
      4 c  Apple cider
 
  This chilled meat and vegetable soup is a popular Russian dish. It's
  served with ice cubes in it.  Since there's no substitute for Russian
  Kvass, a fermented and slightly alcoholic liquid made from grain, the
  ingredients in this recipe will have to do.
  
  You may substitute 3 c beef stock and 1 c white wine for the apple
  cider.
  
  Dice meat.  Peel and dice cucumber and eggs.  Slice green onions.
  Combine first 4 ingredients.  Mix together sugar, mustard, sour
  cream, and cider, and beat well. Add beef mixture and chill. Serve
  sprinkled with dill.
  
  Sylvia's notes: I used apple juice and leftover corned beef, and it
  was wonderful.  Absolutely addictive.

      Title: OKTAPODI KRASATO (OCTOPUS IN RED WINE)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/4 lb Young octopus
      8 tb Olive oil
     12 oz Shallots
    1/2 c  Red wine
      6 tb Red wine vinegar
      8 oz Canned tomatoes;
           -roughly chopped
      2 tb Tomato puree
      4    Bay leaves
      2 ts Dried oregano
           Black pepper
      2 tb Parsley; chopped
 
  First clean the octopus.  Pull off the tentacles, remove and discard
  the intestines and the ink sac, the eyes and the beak. Skin the
  octopus and wash and scrub it thoroughly to remove any traces of
  sand. Cut it into 1 1/2 to 2 inch pieces and put it into a saucepan
  over medium heat to release the liquid.  Stir the octopus until this
  liquid has evaporated.
  
  Pour on the oil and stir the octopus to seal it on all sides. Add the
  whole onions and cook them, stirring once or twice, until they colour
  slightly.
  
  Add the wine, the vinegar, tomatoes, tomato puree, bay leaves,
  oregano and several grindings of pepper.  Stir well, cover the pan
  and simmer very gently for 60 to 75 minutes, checking from time to
  time that the sauce has not dried out.  If it does - and this would
  only happen if the heat were too high - add a little more wine or
  water. The octopus is cooked when it can be easily pierced with a
  skewer.
  
  The sauce should be thick, like a runny paste.  If any of the liquid
  separates, remove the lid from the pan, slightly increase the heat
  and stir until some of the liquid evaporates and the sauce thickens.
  Discard the bay leaves and stir in the parsley.  Taste the sauce and
  adjust the seasoning if necessary.
  
  Serve, if you like, with rice and a salad.  A Greek essential is
  country bread to mop up the sauce.

  liquid after pounding. Wash thoroughly, then drain and cook in a
  covered pan without adding water until the octopus turns bright
  pink-red and feels tender.  Using a sharp knife, cut into rounds the
  width of a small finger. Heat the oil in a tsikali or any pot, add
  the onion, and cook until translucent and soft.  Add the round
  octopus slices to the onion and pour in the wine, and simmer for 15
  minutes. Put the fennel and tomatoes on top of the octopus, season
  with salt and pepper to taste, and give the pot a good shake to mix.

    1/2 c  Red wine vinegar
      4    Garlic clove
           Salt; to taste
           Black pepper; to taste
      1 ts Dried thyme
           Lemon wedges, to serve
 
  Prepare and wash the octopus (as in Octopus in Red Wine). Place the
  head and tentacles in a pan with 6-8tbsp water, cover and simmer for
  60 to 75 minutes until it is tender. Test it with a skewer. Drain off
  any remaining liquid and set aside to cool.
  
  Cut the flesh into 1/2" strips and pack them loosely into a
  screw-topped jar.  Mix enough oil and vinegar to fill the jar - the
  exact amount will depend on the relative volumes of the seafood and
  the container - stir in the garlic and season with salt and pepper.
  If you are using dried thyme, mix it with the liquid at this stage.
  Pour it over the octopus, making sure that every last piece is
  completely immersed. If you are using thyme stalks, push them into
  the jar.
  
  Cover the jar and set it aside for at least 4-5 days before using. To
  serve, drain the octopus and serve it on small individual plates or
  saucers with the lemon wedges.
  
  Cubes of at least one-day old bread, speared on cocktail sticks, are
  the usual accompaniment.

      Title: OLD & FRESH EGGS
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2    Preserved eggs
      2    Fresh eggs
      1 tb Chicken stock
    1/8    Level teaspoon salt
           Oil or fat
      2 ts Soy sauce
      2 ts Sesame oil
    1/2    Level teaspoon MSG
 
  This is another treatment of Thousand Year Eggs.  It's a bit more
  complex than just eating them with a dip, but is still simple and
  elegant. I'd consider the use of MSG as optional, but authentic. The
  preservation of eggs by alkaline ash turns the white to brown and the
  yolk to green. This colour change is actually very beautiful. Gently
  crack the shells of the preserved eggs and remove the egg white
  (brown) carefully, reserving it. Mash the yolks and combine them with
  the fresh eggs, chicken stock and salt.  Grease a bowl and pour in
  the egg mixture. Steam it for about 20 minutes.  When cool, loosen
  the egg from the bowl, slice it in half and cut each half into thins
  slices. Chop the egg white (brown) very finely, and arrange the
  slices around it. Mix the soy sauce, sesame oil and MSG together, and
  carefully spoon this sauce over the slices only. The sauce will
  gradually seep into the egg.

      Title: OLD BUFFALO BREATH CHILI (1985)
 Categories: Chile peppe, Chili, Texas cooki
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 lb Chuck roast
      8    Cloves garlic -- crushed
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      2 tb Mexican oregano
      1 tb Cumin seeds -- toasted and
           Ground
           Juice of 1 lime
      2 tb Mild chile
      2 tb Hot chile
           Beef broth
           Masa harina
        sm Whole dried piquin chiles
           Salt -- to taste
 
  This writer's own. On the Texas range, firewood meant mesquite. Not
  only did the trail cook use it for his own pit cooking, but the ranch
  cook used it to fire his wood stove. Until it was replaced with gas
  and electric, mesquite-flavored grilling dominated rural Texas
  cooking with its distinctive sweet savor. The meat rof this chili is
  seared over charcoal where mesquite chips have been set to flame (the
  taste of mesquite charcoal is indistinguishable from that of any
  other hardwood), which gives the resulting chili a haunting hint of
  smoke -- and without tasting a bit like barbecue, since there is no
  onion or tomato in it, none at all.
  
  For the fire: mesquite wood chips and hardwood charcoal.
  
  For the Rub: 2 or 3 cloves of garlic and chili powder.
  
  The chuck roast should be as lean as possible and cut at least three
  inches thick. Two or three hours before you plan to make the chili,
  rub the meat all over with a mash of crushed garlic and salt then
  sprinkle it with chili powder to coat it lightly. Loosely cover it
  with plastic and set it aside.
  
  Fire up enough hardwood charcoal to sear the meat in an outdoor grill,
  preferably one with a cover. At the same time, soak a few handfuls of
  the mesquite chips in the water. When the coals are covered with gray
  ash, spread them out evenly, and scatter the soaked mesquite chips
  over them. Then immediately set the meat on a grill over the smoke,
  about an inch from the coals. Cover the grill and adjust the dampers
  to maintain a slow, steady heat. Let meat sear for about 12 minutes
  (this is meant to flavor, not to cook the meat) and turn over to sear
  the other side for the same amount of time. Remove it from the heat,
  saving any juices on its surface, and transfer to the refrigerator.
  Let it cool thoroughly, about one hour.
  
  After the meat has cooled, trim away any surface fat or cartilage.
  With a sharp knive, cube the meat into the smallest pieces you have
  patience for, saving all juices. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy
  pot over moderate heat. Stir in the garlic and saute until it turns
  translucent. Stir in the meat and all reserved meat juices, adding
  just enough beef broth to cover, or about one cup. Pour in the lime
  juice and sprinkle in the rest of the seasonings, stirring and
  tasting as you go. Crumble in a few piquins or other fiery chiles to
  bring the heat up to taste. However, do not try to adjust the
  seasoning to perfection right now; it's easy to ruin a chili by
  correcting the flavors too soon -- the long cooking will smooth and
  sweeten it.
  
  Lower the heat to as low as possible. If the pot is left to boil, the
  meat will toughen. Every half hour or so after the first hour, taste
  for seasoning, adjusting and thickening with the masa harina a
  teaspoonful at a time. The chili should be about ready to eat in
  three hours, although it will benefit from a night's aging in the
  refrigerator.
  
  Serve it simmering in large, heavy bowls with an ample supply of soda
  crackers and a side of beans, but not much else except, maybe, hot,
  black coffee or quart-sized glasses of iced tea or a few frosty
  bottles of your favorite beer. And, after a good long while, push
  things aside, lean back in your chair, and start arguing.

  a lightly floured surface or by pulsing about 15 to 20 times in the
  food processor, until the dough is smooth and springy to the touch.
  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn over to coat all
  sides. Cover with a damp towel and set the dough in a warm place
  until it has doubled in bulk, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Punch the dough
  down and knead a few strokes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or wax
  paper and place it in the refrigerator until well chilled,
  approximately 1 hour. With a knife, cut the dough into 25 equal
  pieces. Using your hands, roll each piece into a cylinder 10 to 12
  inches long. (If you prefer larger, soft pretzels, cut the dough into
  only 15 pieces and roll into cylinders that are 14 to 16 inches
  long.) You will have a more even-looking cylinder if you place the
  dough on a firm surface and roll your hands across the top, moving
  from the center outward. Shape each cylinder into a pretzel by
  forming a loop in the center, twisting the ends and attaching them to
  the bottom of the loop. Bring the 2 quarts of water to a boil. Add
  the baking soda and the remaining 2 Tablespoons sugar to the water.
  Drop the pretzels into the water one at a time and, with a slotted
  spoon, remove each one as it pops back up to the surface in about 2
  to 3 seconds. Place the pretzels on a towel right side up to drain
  for a few minutes. Then place them on a baking sheet which has been
  lightly sprinkled with cornmeal. Preheat the oven to 350~F. Brush the
  tops with the egg and sprinkle lightly and evenly with coarse salt.
  Bake for 15 to 25 minutes, depending on size, until well browned.
  Cool on a rack. Yield: 15 large or 25 small pretzels.

      Title: OLD COUNTRY SOURDOUGH RYE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 ts Dry yeast
    1/3 c  Lukewarm water
      1 ts Honey
      1 c  Lukewarm water
      3 tb Molasses
      1 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Mashed potatoes
      1 c  *onion starter
      1 tb Caraway seed
      1 tb Salt
  2 1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
    1/2 c  Wheat germ
  1 1/2 c  Rye flour
      2 tb Corn meal
      1    Egg, beaten
      1 ts Caraway seeds
 
  Sprinkle yeast over 1/3 cup lukewarm water.  Add 1 tsp. honey. Let
  dissolve for five minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup
  lukewarm water, molasses, oil, mashed potatoes and mix until smooth.
  Add yeast mixture, onion starter, caraway seeds and salt.  Mix until
  well-blended. Add whole-wheat flour, (reserving 1/2 cup for
  kneading), and wheat germ, mix well for about 5 minutes. Let dough
  rest for 10 minutes. Add rye flour. Knead on a board for about 10
  minutes, using 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour, until dough is elastic, and
  "springy." Place dough in an oiled bowl, turning it over to coat
  surface with oil. Cover, set bowl in hot water and leave to rise in a
  warm place for 1 1/2 hours until doubled in bulk. Stir down dough and
  divide into two loaves. These can be shaped in rounds and placed on
  an oiled cookie sheet which has been sprinkled with corn meal, or
  they can be placed in oiled loaf pans. Glaze tops with beaten egg and
  sprinkle with caraway seeds. Set to rise in an unheated oven for
  approximately one hour.  Turn oven to 400 for 20 minutes, then turn
  it down to 375 and bake for 30 minutes longer or until bread tests
  done. (For a crustier load, put a pan of hot water on oven floor
  during the first 20 minutes when oven is at 400.) Cool on rack before
  serving.
  
  *To make onion starter, add 1 small, peeled onion--loosely wrapped in
  cheesecloth, to fresh batch of basic sourdough starter mixture and
  leave to sour at room temperature for at least three days. Before
  making old country rye bread, add a second cup of water and a second
  cup of flour to the onion starter, leaving it at room temperature
  overnight. 2 loaves.

      Title: OLD DOMINION POUND CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      8 lg Egg; room temperature
  2 1/4 c  Flour, sifted
    1/4 ts Baking soda
  2 1/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Butter; room temp
      2 T  Lemon juice
  2 1/4 ts Vanilla
    1/8 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Cream of tartar
      1 c  Walnuts; chopped very fine
           Sugar, confectioners
 
  Alex Patout writes, "This is a special-occasion cake that we like to
  serve with whipped cream.  It mellows with age, so make it at least
  one day ahead of serving.  It keeps well in the refrigerator for
  several days and freezes beautifully."
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Butter and flour a Bundt or tube pan.
  Separate the eggs.  Sift the flour with the baking soda and 1-1/4
  cups of sugar. Place the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer and
  cream it well. Beat in the flour-sugar mixture by thirds, then beat
  in the lemon juice and vanilla.  Beat in the egg yolks one by one,
  being sure each is absorbed before you add the next.
  
  In a separate mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy.  Add the
  salt and the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks
  form. Gradually beat in the remaining 1 cup of sugar, and continue
  beating until the mixture is glossy and holds stiff peaks.
  
  Fold the nuts into the flour mixture, and gently fold in the beaten
  egg whites.  Turn the batter into the prepared pan and gently cut
  through the batter once or twice with a rubber spatula to break any
  large air bubbles.
  
  Bake the cake for 1-1/2 hours, or until a knife or toothpick inserted
  near the center comes out clean.  Do not open the oven during the
  first hour of baking.  Turn off the heat and let the cake sit in the
  hot oven for 15 minutes.  Then remove and let cool in the pan for 15
  minutes more. Remove the cake from the pan and sprinkle lightly with
  confectioners' sugar. Let cool thoroughly, then wrap tight in foil.
  
  Serve in thin slices, with whipped cream, if desired, or with the ice
  cream described in the previous recipe.

      2 ts Cumin -- or to taste
      3 ts Chili powder -- or to taste
      3    Plum tomatoes -- chopped
           Salt and pepper to taste
           FOR THE CHICKEN:
      3    Whole bone-in chicken
           Breast
           (14 to 16 ounces)
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Chili powder
      1 ts Cumin
      1 tb Diced garlic
      2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
           TO SERVE:
           Salsa for topping
      4    Quesadillas* or corn bread
           Chopped fresh cilantro for
           Garnish
 
  For the beans: Soak beans overnight in water to cover. Drain. Over low
  heat, stir peppers and onion in olive oil for one minute. Add beans
  and saute over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add
  stock, garlic, cumin and chili powder. Simmer, uncovered, until beans
  are soft, about 1 1/2 hours, adding more broth as necessary. Stir in
  tomatoes about 20 minutes before beans are done and season to taste
  with salt and pepper. To Roast the chicken: Crack the breast bones to
  flatten. Rub breasts with oil and season with remaining ingredients.
  Then roast in a preheated 350 degree oven about 30 minutes, being
  sure not to overcook. Cool slightly and remove meat form bones. (If
  boneless breasts are used, grilling is preferable since they would
  dry out quickly if roasted.) To Serve: Place a generous portion of
  beans in large, flat soup bowl. Slice chicken thinly, keeping skin on
  (skin may be removed, but some of the seasoning will be lost) and
  place on top of the beans. Garnish with salsa, sour cream, cilantro,
  and a warm quesadilla. *Make quesadillas by tipping a soft flour
  tortilla with about 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese, 2 T sour cream,
  and hot peppers to taste. Fold each into quarters and warm through in
  a 350F oven. This recipe was touted by Barbra Streisand during her
  visit Inauguration week. Aretha Frankin also took 3 qts home to

  raisins 1 pound currants 1 pound pitted dates, cut in pieces 1/2 pound

  mixture of rum, coffee, and fruit peel and juices. Add fruit and nut

  *    Use cooking apples like Macs or Granny Smith's. Core and peel
  then +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++ ++++ Divide the pastry almost in half and roll out the
  larger half on a lightly floured surface to a 13-inch circle. Line a
  9-inch pie tin with the pastry. Trim the edge to 1/2-inch beyond the
  rim of the pie tin. Combine the apples, 1 cup of apple cider and the
  sugar in a 3-quart saucepan and cook, over high heat, until the
  mixture comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 8
  minutes or until the apples are tender. Drain the apples, reserving
  the syrup.  Add enough additional apple cider to the syrup to make 1
  1/3 cups.  Return the syrup and apples to the saucepan. Combine the
  cornstarch and water in a small bowl and stir until well blended.
  Stir the cornstarch mixture and the cinnamon into the apple mixture.
  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes
  to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, then pour the
  mixture into the pastry lined pie tin. Roll out the remaining pastry
  to an 11-inch circle. Fold the pastry gently, so as not to tear it,
  into quarters and cut slits in the folds.  Gently unfold the pastry
  on to the top of the filling and trim the edge to 1-inch beyond the
  rim of the pie tin. Fold the top crust under the lower crust and form
  a ridge by fluting the edge of the pie. Bake in a 400 degree F. oven
  for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack until
  slightly warm before cutting and serving. NOTE: This is the perfect
  pie to serve with the rich cheddar sauce in this file.

      Title: OLD FASHIONED BAKED BEANS
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Great northern or small
      2 lb Mixed beans - Great
           Northerns, white beans
           Romans, and random mix.
      1 ts Salt (omitted)
      1 ts Dry mustard
      2 ts Dry mustard
    1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Black pepper from a bottle
      1 ds Hot sauce
      1 ts (heaping) hot chili
           Condiment
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
  1 1/2 c  Coarse chopped onion
    1/4 c  Molasses or honey
    1/2 c  (scant) honey
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      8 ts White sugar
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
    1/2 c  White vinegar
 
  Presoak beans.  Drain.  Combine dry ingredients and mix with beans;
  stir in other ingredients.  Pour into 1 1/2 qt. or 2 qt. baking dish
  or bean pot. [Obviously, if you double the recipe like I did, you'll
  need a bigger pot :-]  Pour in boiling water to cover. Cover. Bake at
  300 degrees for 6 hours; add a bit of boiling water if needed.
  (Crock-pot method: cook on low 8-10 hours.)
  
  Comments:  I just dumped everything on top of the beans and stirred
  them; then covered them with hot tap water. They took a lot longer
  than 10 hours to cook, but that might have been due to too-low heat
  on the crockpot. (Also, reportedly vinegar and other acid substances
  need to be added at the end of cooking else they'll make the beans
  tough.)
  
  These beans were *really* good.  The caramelized onions were even
  better. I've enjoyed the beans plain, with barbecue sauce, and with
  spinach and corn added.

      Title: OLD FASHIONED CHOCOLATE PUDDING
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Milk
      3 tb Cornstarch
      4 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Good quality cocoa
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Scald 1 1/2 cups of milk in a heavy saucepan (look for tiny bubbles
  around the edge).  Mix together the cornstarch, sugar, salt and
  cocoa, add the remaining 1/2 cup milk, and stir until well blended.
  Stir in the scalded milk and blend well.  Pour the mixture back into
  the saucepan and stir constantly over medium heat until thickened.
  Let the pudding boil for one minute while stirring briskly. Remove
  from heat, pour into a bowl and let cool for a few minutes. Stir in
  the vanilla, spoon into serving dishes.
  
  You can eat the pudding warm (you probably -will- taste it while
  warm) or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. A little heavy
  cream over each serving is nice, maybe a little cookie along side . .
  . I never use salt and cut the sugar back to 3 Tbs. You can
  experiment a little. I usually use low fat or 1% milk. Nonfat is OK
  too, but it does loose a little something. There's no need to use
  whole milk, but you can.
  
  Use good quality cocoa and high quality vanilla extract. You can use
  vanilla sugar also, which is my favorite way. Take 1/2 a vanilla bean
  and slit it vertically and then cut each half into two or three
  pieces. Add the pieces to a cup of sugar, cover, and let it sit a few
  days. The sugar then becomes flavored by the vanilla. Remove the
  vanilla pieces and the sugar is ready to use.
  
  This recipe allows for the formation of a "skin" on the top of the
  pudding. I've been told that by laying a piece of plastic wrap over
  the top while the pudding is setting up, the skin won't form. I've
  not tried that, so I don't know if it really works. I like that skin

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Instant mashed potato flakes
    1/3 c  Boiling water
    1/4    To 1/2 cup warm water
      4 tb Sugar
      1 pk Active dry yeast

    1/2 c  Dark raisins
      1 ts Salt
      1    Egg
           Cinnamon Sugar
 
  Makes 1 loaf
  
  Stir potato flakes into boiling water.  Cool until lukewarm. Reserve.
  
  Combine 1/4 cup of the warm water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and
  yeast. Stir to dissolve yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5
  minutes.
  
  Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, dry milk, butter,
  remaining 3 tablespoons of the sugar and salt into work bowl. Process
  until mixed, about 15 seconds.
  
  Add potato mixture to flour mixture.  Process until mixed, about 5
  seconds.
  
  Add yeast mixture and egg to flour mixture.  Turn on processor and
  very slowly drizzle just enough remaining water through feed tube
  into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that cleans the sides of the
  bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl about 25 times. Turn off
  processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.
  
  Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
  make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
  dough turns around bowl about 15 times.
  
  Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead 1/2 cup dark
  raisins into the dough..  Shape into ball and place in lightly
  greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover loosely with plastic
  wrap and let stand in warm place until  doubled, about 1 hour.

  parts.  Shape each part into strand 20 inches long. Roll each strand
  in Cinnamon Sugar. Braid strands together and place in greased
  9x5x3-inch loaf pan.  Tuck ends under and pinch to seal. Let stand in
  warm place until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.
  
  Heat oven to 350 F.  Bake until evenly brown and loaf sounds hollow
  when tapped, 35 - 40 minutes.
  
  Remove immediately from pan.  Cool on wire rack.

      Title: OLD FASHIONED COCONUT CUSTARD PIE
 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Sweet Dough -- for a 1 crust
           Pie,
           Above
           Filling:
      1 lg , fresh coconut, about 1 1/2
           Pounds
      2 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      4 lg Eggs
           Tiny pinch freshly grated
           Nutmeg
           One 9 inch Pyrex pie pan
 
  Prepare and chill the dough. Set a rack at the middle level of the
  oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Use a large nail or an ice pick to
  puncture one of the three eyes on the coconut (only one can be
  punctured so you will need to try each until you find it). Drain the
  coconut milk out over a bowl. Strain it to remove any flecks of shell
  and reserve it. Place the coconut on the oven rack and bake it until
  it cracks, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the coconut from the oven
  and let it cool slightly. Remove shell (it will come away easily),
  then cut the coconut meat into 8 or 10 pieces. With a vegetable
  peeler, remove brown skin. Coarsely grate 1 cup coconut, either by
  hand or in the food processor, and reserve it for the filling.
  Process the remaining coconut until it is very fine. In a large
  saucepan over low heat, scald the milk until there are bubbles around
  the edges. Add the finely processed coconut. Remove from the heat and
  allow the mixture to cool completely. Pour it through a fine strainer
  into a bowl; press coconut to extract as much moisture as possible.
  In 3 or 4 batches, place coconut in the corner of a clean dish towel
  and wring out over bowl to extract all remaining liquid. (If you
  wish, you can toast the wrungout coconut, though it will have very
  little flavor remaining after soaking in the milk.) Measure the coco
  nut flavored milk and add more milk, if necessary, to make 2 cups.
  (This may be done earlier in the day or even the day before and set
  aside tightly covered in the refrigerator.) Pour into a bowl and
  whisk in sugar, eggs, vanilla and nutmeg and the reserved coconut
  milk. Stir in the reserved coarsely grated coconut. Set a rack in the
  lowest level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Roll out the
  dough for the bottom crust and arrange in pan. Pour filling into pie
  crust. Bake the pie for about 45 minutes, until the crust is baked
  through and the filling is set, but not over-cooked. After the pie
  has baked for 30 minutes, check it frequently so it does not
  over-cook. Once the pie is wobbly textured when the pan is gently
  shaken, remove it from the oven; it will continue to cook for a few
  minutes longer after it is removed from the oven. If the pie is over
  baked, it will be heavy and watery. Cool the pie on a rack. OLD
  FASHIONED CUSTARD PIE: Omit coconut. Add 1/2 cup heavy or light cream
  to the milk. Mix sugar with 1 teaspoon cornstarch before adding to
  milk. Bake as above. Yield: one 9-inch pie

    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Lemon juice
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Buttermilk Biscuit Dough
      2 tb Buttermilk
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Soft butter

MMMMM------------------BUTTERMILK BISCUIT DOUGH-----------------------
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Cake flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Cold unsalted butter
    3/4 c  Buttermilk or heavy cream
           (or more)
 
  Preheat the oven to 450F; set rack in middle level. Prepare biscuit
  dough. For a large shortcake, pat the dough into a 9-inch disk on a
  parchment-lined cookie sheet. For individual shortcakes, pat dough
  into a 6-by-12- inch rectangle and cut into eight 3-inch biscuits
  with a sharp, floured knife. Transfer to a parchment-lined cookie
  sheet. Paint tops with buttermilk. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake for 10
  to 15 minutes, until well risen and golden. Check the center of the
  large shortcake with a toothpick to make sure it is baked through: If
  the pick emerges with dough still clinging to it, lower temperature
  to 350F and bake another 5 minutes. Slide the large shortcake onto a
  platter immediately after it is baked. Use a sharp, serrated knife to
  slice through the middle, making two layers. Slide the edge of a
  cookie sheet between the two layers and lift the top layer off.
  Butter the bottom layer and pour all but 1/2 cup of the sweetened
  fruit on. Slide the top back on and pour the remaining berries over
  the top. Split the small shortcakes in the same way and place the
  bottoms on individual dessert plates. Butter them and top with about
  1/3 cup of the fruit mixture. Replace tops and pour a tablespoon or
  so of the remaining berries over the top. Serve immediately. Pass the
  cream in a bowl for the guests to help themselves. BUTTERMILK BISCUIT
  DOUGH: COMBINE THE FLOURS, salt and baking powder in a mixing bowl
  and stir well to mix. Rub in the butter by hand or with a pastry
  blender until the mixture is mealy. Stir in 3/4 cup of the buttermilk
  with a fork and continue stirring gently until the dough begins to
  hold together. (If the dough is dry, add more buttermilk, 1
  tablespoon at a time.) Sprinkle the work surface generously with
  flour and scrape the dough onto it. Fold the dough over on itself two
  or three times. Use the dough immediately for shortcakes, following
  the instructions above. Use this recipe to make a large shortcake or
  eight small ones. This same dough is used as the topping in cobbler
  recipes.

      1 ds Black Pepper
      3 tb Chili Powder
      3 c  Boiling Water
    1/4 c  Melted Butter or Oil
     12    Corn Tortillas
      2 ts Ground Cumin
     10 oz Grated Cheese(cheddar/jack)
      1 ts Salt
      1 lg Onion diced or chopped
      1    Beef Bouillon cube
    1/2 c  Green Pepper diced or chopt
    1/2 ts Garlic Powder
  1 1/2 c  Cooking oil hot for frying
 
  Brown the Flour at about 450F. for 10-15 minutes; do not let it burn.
  Combine the browned flour with the other dry ingredients and blend
  with the butter (oil) over low heat until smooth. Slowly add the
  boiling water, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously. Add
  the bouillon cube and stir as you add the remaining water. Simmer the
  sauce for about one hour, stirring occasionally. Fry the Tortillas,
  one at a time, for about five to ten seconds per side in the hot oil
  (they should not get crisp, this is just to "cook" them a little --
  the time depends entirely on the temperature of the oil). Remove them
  from the oil, draining excess oil back into skillet and then dip them
  in the hot enchilada sauce. Place tortilla on a plate and spoon about
  1 tablespoon of a mixture of the Onion and Green Pepper along a line
  about 1-1/2 inch from the center of the tortilla. Place about 1
  tablespoon of cheese along that line also. Carefully roll (it will be
  hot) the tortilla around the filling and place it seam side down in a
  rectangular baking dish. Repeat with all the tortillas. Pour the
  remaining sauce over the enchiladas and then spread some of the
  remaining onions/peppers over the top. Finally, top it with a
  generous portion of the grated cheese. Bake at about 300F. for 15-20
  minutes. DO NOT OVER COOK!
  
  You can optionally add some spiced, cooked ground beef or some spiced
  cooked boneless chicken to the filling; reduce the onion/pepper/cheese
  amount by one-half and add one tablespoon of meat filling.

           -shoulder cubed
      1 ts Salt
      5 tb Butter
     18    Peeled white onions
           Water
      1 lb Fresh mushrooms, quartered
  6 2/3 c  Chicken stock
      2    Carrots peeled and cut into
           -strips
      1 ts Lemon juice
      3 tb Flour
      1    Onion
      2    Egg yolks
      2    Celery tops
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1    Leek
           Salt
      1 ts Thyme
           White pepper
      1    Bay leaf
      2 tb Finely chopped parsley
      4    Parsley sprigs
 
  In a heavy casserole, blanch the veal by covering with cold water,
  bringing it to a boil over high heat and boiling for one minute.
  Drain, and rinse under cold water. Return the veal to the casserole
  (which has been wiped clean) and add 6 cups of the chicken stock,
  carrots, onion, celery, leek, herbs  and  salt. The meat should be
  covered in liquid; if not, add more water.  Bring to a  boil  and
  simmer  over moderate heat partially covered for 1-11/2 hrs  until
  the meat is tender.
  
  Meanwhile, combine 2/3 cups of the chicken stock, 2 TB of butter and
  the white onions in a skillet. Bring to a boil and simmer 15-20
  minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowel. Stir the mushrooms
  and lemon juice to the remaining liquid in skillet. Bring to a boil,
  cover and simmer for 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the
  mushrooms to the bowel with the onions. Pour all remaining liquid
  into  the simmering veal.
  
  When  the  veal is done, remove from casserole. Strain the stock
  through a fine sieve , return to casserole and boil until reduced to
  1/2. In a small saucepan, melt 3 TB of butter and stir in flour. Cook
  this "roux" for 2 minutes and remove from heat. Pour the reduced
  stock in and blend with a whisk. Then return it to the heat, and cook
  stirring constantly until the sauce comes to a boil  and  thickens.
  Simmer for about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
  
  In a bowl whisk together egg yolks and cream. Whisk in the hot sauce
  2 TB at a time until 1/2 cup has been added. Then reverse the process
  and whisk the egg-cream-sauce mixture into the hot sauce. (This is to
  prevent curdling.) Bring  to a boil in the sauce pan, season with
  salt and white pepper and a few drops of lemon juice.
  
  Place  the  veal and vegetables in the large casserole and pour the
  sauce over. Toss and heat gently. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

MMMMM----------------------------MEAT---------------------------------
      5 lb Bottom round roast of beef
      2 ts Bacon fat
      8 oz Tomato sauce
      1    Bouillon cube
    1/2 c  Red wine
      3 tb Brown sugar; or more

      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2 ts Arrowroot; approximately
 
  Combine all the ingredients for the marinade in a porcelain-enameled
  container. Add the meat and for best results marinate for 10 days, if
  not more. Turn twice daily.
  
  When ready to cook, presoak a large clay pot, top and bottom, in
  water for 15 minutes.
  
  Remove the meat from marinade, put in a large frying pan, and sear on
  all sides in the hot bacon fat. Meanwhile, pour the marinade into a
  saucepan and reduce to 1/3 its original volume by boiling rapidly,
  uncovered. Place the meat in the presoaked pot, then add the marinade
  and all the other ingredients except the arrowroot.
  
  Cover the pot and place it in a cold oven. Set the oven temperature
  at 425 degrees. Cook for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until almost done, then
  remove the po from the oven and pour off the sauce. Return the pot to
  the oven, uncovered, for a final 10 minutes of cooking.
  
  Meanwhile, put the sauce into a blender container and blend. Taste for
  seasoning; the sauce should be "sweet and sour." If not, add brown
  sugar and/or vinegar. Heat the sauce, thicken with the arrowroot, and
  serve over the meat and German potato pancakes.

    7/8 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
           Cayenne pepper to taste
      2 ts Baking powder
           Oil for deep frying
 
  (1) Cut the corn from the cobs, and scrape the cobs well to extract
  the milk. You should have 1-1/2 to 2 cups of corn. Mash 1/4 cup of
  the corn pulp with a potato masher or in a blender or processor.
  (This helps to distribute the corn flavor and extract some starch.)
  Return it to the rest of the corn.
  
  (2) Mix the egg yolks with the corn. Sift together the flour, salt,
  sugar, cayenne, and baking powder. Add to the corn and mix well.
  
  (3) Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry and grainy, and fold
  them into the corn mixture.
  
  (4) Heat fresh oil in a deep-fat fryer to about 375 degrees F. Drop
  the batter by tablespoonfuls into the fat, and cook the fritters
  until browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Turn, and when both sides
  are golden brown, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper
  towels. Serve at once.
