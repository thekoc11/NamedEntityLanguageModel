      Title: REAL WHITE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/4 c  :warm water (approx 105F)
      1 pk Dry yeast
  1 3/4 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter; softened
           Vegetable shortening or oil
      2 tb Sugar
  2 1/2 ts Salt
  5 1/2 c  All-purpose flour (or more)
 
  POUR THE WARM WATER over the yeast. Stir well, and let stand to
  dissolve. Heat the milk, stirring, to the same temperature as the
  yeast, then pour it over the dissolved yeast. Add the butter (or
  shortening or oil), sugar, salt and 4 cups of the flour. Beat
  vigorously with a large spoon for at least 1 minute. Stir in enough
  of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a stiff but not
  dry dough. Dust the kneading surface with 1/4 cup of the reserved
  flour and turn the dough out onto it, cleaning the bowl completely
  with a rubber spatula. Knead the dough for 1 minute, sprinkling extra
  flour a little at a time as necessary, then let rest for 10 minutes.
  Resume kneading for about 6 to 8 minutes more, or until the dough is
  smooth and elastic. Put in a lightly greased bowl, cover and let rest
  in a warm place to rise for between 1 and 2 hours. When the dough has
  doubled in bulk, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and punch
  it down for a minute. Cut dough in half and pat each half into an
  oval the approximate length of your bread pan, which should be
  lightly greased. Put in the pan, cover with a damp towel and let rise
  for another 45 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350F and, when
  the bread is risen, put it in the oven. Bake for about 40-to-45
  minutes in a glass pan, or 45-to-50 minutes in a metal pan. Makes 2
  Loaves

      Title: REALLY HARD CIDER
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ga Cider
 
  With the last recipe, you created hard cider.  That will have a max of
  about 10% (20 proof) unless you know enough about wine making not to
  need to read this. Now lets say it had too much wild yeast and you
  don't like the taste or it tastes great but you, purely in the spirit
  of the inquiring mind, want to taste the elixir of our ancestors.
       You take the result after the bubbling has gone down and put it
  in a bowl and freeze it.  The longer and colder the better, 24 hours
  at least. It won't all freeze. Put a pie pan under a collander and
  pour the slush into it.  Give it a moment and then through away what
  is in the collander.
       What is left in the pan should be around 25% or 50 proof. A mixed
  drink is generally around 40 proof. Let your inquiring mind be warned.
       For anyone concerned about US laws (why I have no idea) this
  method is not illegal. Submitted By MGIWER@AOL.COM On MON, 30 OCT

      Title: RECETA DE  FLAN ANTIGUA
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 9 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Gran. sugar ( for caramel )
    1/4 c  Drk brn sugar (for caramel)
      5    Eggs
      2    Egg yolks
      4 c  Half & half
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Sugar
      1 tb Vanilla extract
           *RUM AND BRANDY SYRUP*
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      6 oz Water
      1 oz Brandy
      1 tb Rum Extract
 
  Servings:  9
  
  Have a 2 quart pudding dish, or 9 single serving dishes ready. Be
  sure they are dry. Melt and carmelize the 2/3 cup sugar,and the 1/4
  cup brown sugar in a heavy skillet. When sugar melts and turns a dark
  golden color (about 5 min.) pour into the custard dishes and tilt
  back and forth with a swirling motion to cover bottom and sides of
  dish. It may be necessary to spread the caramel with a spoon. Set
  aside and allow to cool. Beat eggs and the egg yolks into the half
  and half. Add the salt and sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves. Add
  vanilla. Strain, and pour into prepared custard dish. Preheat oven to
  325 degrees. Set dish in a pan of hot water and bake, covered with
  foil. Bake the large custard about 1 1/2 hrs. or until a knife
  inserted in center comes out clean. The smaller ones will cook about
  1 hr. Perform knife test as above. Remove from the oven and allow to
  cool slightly. Place a round rimmed platter over the large flan or a
  serving plate over each of the single serving flans and flip them
  over slowly. Do this carefully, as the caramelized syrup will pour
  out as the flan releases from the container. Cool and serve. I
  sometimes garnish with pecan halves.
  
  ***** Rum and Brandy Syrup *****
  
  Caramelize the sugar in a heavy skillet. Add water and stir until the
  caramel is dissolved. Boil until quite thick. Add the Brandy and Rum
  extract and stir until combined. Cool and serve with the flan for
  those who desire additional syrup with a slightly different flavor.

      Title: RECOMMENDED CANNERS (PART 1 OF 3)
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  Equipment for heat-processing home-canned food is of two main
  types--boiling-water canners and pressure canners. Most are designed
  to hold seven Quart jars or eight to nine pints. Small pressure
  canners hold four quart jars; some large pressure canners hold 18
  pint jars in two layers, but hold only seven quart jars. Pressure
  saucepans with smaller volume capacities are not recommended for use
  in canning. Small capacity pressure canners are treated in a similar
  manner as standard larger canners, and should be vented using the
  typical venting procedures.
  
  Low-acid foods must be processed in a pressure canner to be free of
  botulism risks. Although pressure canners may also be used for
  processing acid foods, boiling-water canners are recommended for this
  purpose because they are faster. A pressure canner would require from
  55 to 100 minutes to process a load of jars; while the total time for
  processing most acid foods in boiling water varies from 25 to 60
  minutes. A boiling-water canner loaded with filled jars requires
  about 20 to 30 minutes of heating before its water begins to boil. A
  loaded pressure canner requires about 12 to 15 minutes of heating
  before it begins to vent; another 10 minutes to vent the canner;
  another 5 minutes to pressurize the canner; another 8 to 10 minutes
  to process the acid food; and, finally, another 20 to 60 minutes to
  cool the canner before removing jars.
  
  Boiling-Water Canners
  
  These canners are made of aluminum or porcelain-covered steel. They
  have removable perforated racks and fitted lids. The canner must be
  deep enough so that at least 1 inch of briskly boiling water will be
  over the tops of jars during processing. Some boiling-water canners
  do not have flat bottoms. A flat bottom must be used on an electric
  range. Either a flat or ridged bottom can be used on a gas burner. To
  ensure uniform processing of all jars with an electric range, the
  canner should be no more than 4 inches wider in diameter than the
  element on which it is heated.
  
  Using Boiling-Water Canners
  
  Follow these steps for successful boiling-water canning:
  
  * Fill the canner halfway with water.
  
  * Preheat water to 140 degrees F for raw-packed foods and to 180
  degrees F for hot-packed foods.
  
  * Load filled jars, fitted with lids, into the canner rack and use the
  handles to lower the rack into the water; or fill the canner, one jar
  at a time, with a jar lifter.
  
  * Add more boiling water if needed, so the water level is at least 1
  inch above jar tops.
  
  * Turn heat to its highest position until water boils vigorously.
  
  * Set a timer for the minutes required for processing the food.
  
  * Cover with the canner lid and lower the heat setting to maintain a
  gentle boil throughout the process schedule.
  
  * Add more boiling water, if needed, to keep the water level above the
  jars.
  
  * When jars have been boiled for the recommended time, turn off the
  heat and remove the canner lid.
  
  * Using a jar lifter remove the jars and place them on a towel,
  leaving at least 1-inch spaces between the jars during cooling.

      Title: RECOMMENDED CANNERS (PART 2 OF 3)
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  Pressure Canners
  
  Pressure canners for use in the home have been extensively redesigned
  in recent years. Models made before the 1970's were heavy-walled
  kettles with clamp-on or turn-on lids. They were fitted with a dial
  gauge, a vent port in the form of a petcock or counterweight, and a
  safety fuse. Modern pressure canners are lightweight, thin-walled
  kettles; most have turn-on lids. They have a jar rack, gasket, dial
  or weighted gauge, an automatic vent/cover lock, a vent port (steam
  vent) to be closed with a counterweight or weighted gauge, and a
  safety fuse.
  
  Pressure does not destroy microorganisms, but high temperatures
  applied for an adequate period of time do kill microorganisms. The
  success of destroying all microorganisms capable of growing in canned
  food is based on the temperature obtained in pure steam, free of air,
  at sea level. At sea level, a canner operated at a gauge pressure of
  10.5 lbs. provides an internal temperature of 240 degrees F.
  
  Two serious errors in temperatures obtained in pressure canners occur
  because:
  
  * Internal canner temperatures are lower at higher altitudes. To
  correct this error, canners must be operated at the increased
  pressures specified in this publication for appropriate altitude
  ranges.
  
  * Air trapped in a canner lowers the temperature obtained at 5, 10,
  or 15 pounds of pressure and results in underprocessing. The highest
  volume of air trapped in a canner occurs in processing raw-packed
  foods in dial-gauge canners. These canners do not vent air during
  processing. To be safe, all types of pressure canners must be vented
  10 minutes before they are pressurized.
  
  To vent a canner, leave the vent port uncovered on newer models or
  manually open petcocks on some older models. Heating the filled
  canner with its lid locked into place boils water and generates steam
  that escapes through the petcock or vent port. When steam first
  escapes, set a timer for 10 minutes. After venting 10 minutes, close
  the petcock or place the counterweight or weighted gauge over the
  vent port to pressurize the canner.
  
  Weighted-gauge models exhaust tiny amounts of air and steam each time
  their gauge rocks or jiggles during processing. They control pressure
  precisely and need neither watching during processing nor checking
  for accuracy. The sound of the weight rocking or jiggling indicates
  that the canner is maintaining the recommended pressure. The single
  disadvantage of weighted-gauge canners is that they cannot correct
  precisely for higher altitudes. At altitudes above 1,000 feet, they
  must be operated at canner pressures of 10 instead of 5, or 15
  instead of 10, PSI.
  
  Check dial gauges for accuracy before use each year and replace if
  they read high by more than 1 pound at 5, 10, or 15 pounds of
  pressure. Low readings cause over-processing and may indicate that
  the accuracy of the gauge is unpredictable. Gauges may be checked at
  most county Cooperative Extension offices.
  
  Handle canner lid gaskets carefully and clean them according to the
  manufacturer's directions. Nicked or dried gaskets will allow steam
  leaks during pressurization of canners. Keep gaskets clean between
  uses. Gaskets on older model canners may require a light coat of
  vegetable oil once per year. Gaskets on newer model canners are
  pre-lubricated and do not benefit from oiling. Check your canner's
  instructions if there is doubt that the particular gasket you use has
  been pre-lubricated.
  
  Lid safety fuses are thin metal inserts or rubber plugs designed to
  relieve excessive pressure from the canner. Do not pick at or scratch
  fuses while cleaning lids. Use only canners that have the
  Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) approval to ensure their safety.
  
  Replacement gauges and other parts for canners are often available at
  stores offering canning equipment or from canner manufacturers. When
  ordering parts, give your canner model number and describe the parts
  needed.

      Title: RECOMMENDED CANNERS (PART 3 OF 3)
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  USING PRESSURE CANNERS
  
  Follow these steps for successful pressure canning:
  
  1. Put 2 to 3 inches of hot water in the canner. Place filled jars on
  the rack, using a jar lifter. Fasten canner lid securely.
  
  2. Leave weight off vent port or open petcock. Heat at the highest
  setting until steam flows from the petcock or vent port.
  
  3. Maintain high heat setting, exhaust steam 10 minutes, and then
  place weight on vent port or close petcock. The canner will
  pressurize during the next 3 to 5 minutes.
  
  4. Start timing the process when the pressure reading on the dial
  gauge indicates that the recommended pressure has been reached, or
  when the weighted gauge begins to jiggle or rock.
  
  5. Regulate heat under the canner to maintain a steady pressure at or
  slightly above the correct gauge pressure. Quick and large pressure
  variations during processing may cause unnecessary liquid losses from
  jars. Weighted gauges on Mirro canners should jiggle about 2 or 3
  times per minute. On Presto canners, they should rock slowly
  throughout the process.
  
  6. When the timed process completed, turn off the heat, remove the
  canner from heat if possible, and let the canner depressurize. Do not
  force-cool the canner. Forced cooling may result in food spoilage.
   Cooling the canner with cold running water or opening the vent port
  before the canner is fully depressurized will cause loss of liquid
  from jars and seal failures. Force-cooling may also warp the canner
  lid of older model canners, causing steam leaks. Depressurization of
  older models should be timed. Standard-size heavy-walled canners
  require about 30 minutes when loaded with pints and 45 minutes with
  quarts. Newer thin-walled canners cool more rapidly and are equipped
  with vent locks. These canners are depressurized when their vent lock
  piston drops to a normal position.
  
  7. After the canner is depressurized, remove the weight from the vent
  port or open the petcock. Wait 2 minutes, unfasten the lid, and
  remove it carefully. Lift the lid away from you so that the steam
  does not burn your face.
  
  8. Remove jars with a lifter, and place on towel or cooling rack, if
  desired.

     20    Black Nicoise olives, pitted
 
  PREPARE THE TART DOUGH. If you are using unyeasted crust, partially
  prebake it. Halve the peppers lengthwise, remove the seeds and veins,
  then halve them crosswise and slice very thinly. Warm 2 tablespoons
  of the olive oil in a wide pan, add the peppers, onion, half the
  garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Saute over medium-high heat for several
  minutes, then lower the heat, add the water or white wine, cover and
  stew until the peppers and onion are very soft and sweet. If the
  peppers and onion threaten to stick as the sugars are released, add
  additional small amounts of water or wine. Taste for salt, and season
  with freshly ground black pepper when the peppers and onion are
  finished cooking. Put 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a blender jar
  with the remaining garlic and a few of the basil leaves and puree.
  Gradually add the rest of the basil leaves, using more oil if
  necessary. Scrape the puree out of the jar, stir in the Parmesan or
  Romano cheese and season with salt. If using the yeasted tart dough,
  prepare the shell, then make the custard. Beat the eggs and yolks
  together, then add the cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Preheat
  the oven to 400F. Paint the crust with the basil puree, then lay half
  the grated Provolone cheese on top, followed by the peppers and
  onion, and the olives. Add the remaining cheese, then the custard.
  Bake the tart in the center of the oven until it is golden brown, and
  set, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the tart rest 5 to 10 minutes before
  serving.

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Dried red kidney beans
      2 c  Chopped yellow onions
      1 bn Of scallions, chopped
      3    Or 4 finely sliced cloves
           -of garlic
      1 bn Parsley (chopped)
      3 lb Smoked sausage *
           Salt and pepper to taste
      3 qt Of cold water
 
  * cut into 2 inch lengths (smoked ham or ham bone works fine)
  
  I just made no-fat refried beans last night completely by accident.
  
  I was making this recipe and discovered it in the process.
  
  Soak beans overnight if possible.  Drain water and add beans to a
  large 8- or 10-quart pot.  Then add enough of the cold water to cover
  the beans. Add chopped yellow onions and garlic and bring to a boil.
  Cook for one hour and add all the other things and more water if
  necessary.
  
  Simmer (slight bubbling action) for 2 more hours or until the beans
  are soft.  Then remove 2 cups of cooked beans without juice and mash
  very good. Then return the mashed up beans to the pot and stir into
  the mixture. This makes a creamy, thicker gravy.  If the beans are
  too dry, add enough water to make them like you like them. Good over
  boiled rice.
  
  Serves 8.
  
  If you're in New Orleans on a Monday, this is the only thing you can
  eat.
  
  From "White Trash Cooking", Ernest Matthew Mickler. Ten Speed Press,
  1986. ISBN 0-89815-189-9.
  
  When I got to the point where you take the two cups beans out and
  mash 'em, I put them in the food processor to puree. They came out
  smelling and tasting just like refried beans.  The texture was a tad
  thin, but that could be remedied easily.  You could probably even
  "re- fry" them in a non-stick skillet to reduce the water content. I
  used skin-on ham hocks to make this batch of beans, but you could
  easily leave that out and still come up with something close to what
  you want, I think.

      Title: RED BEANS WITH PECANS & SAFFRON OVER WHOLE
 Categories: Pasta, Pulses and, Sauces and
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 sm Can Red Beans
           Pecan Halves
           Dry Red Wine
           Saffron
           Oregano
           Thyme
           Black Pepper
           Olive Oil
           Garlic
 
  Drain a small can of red beans.  (Pintos may substitute.) Save the
  juice in a small bowl and add a small amount of crumbled saffron to
  it so it marinates.  Not too much, you want the taste to be subtle,
  not dominant.
  
  Saute garlic in olive oil for a little bit, along with pecan halves
  and some crushed red chiles. Add the drained beans and cook so the
  flavors mingle.  Add quite a bit of oregano and less thyme and a
  pinch of black pepper.  Add some dry red wine, don't be too shy. Add
  in the saffron-flavored bean liquid and cook a few more minutes. The
  consistency should be thin but not like soup.
  
  Serve over whole wheat spaghetti.  Brown rice might also work.

           Pork shoulder (5 to 7 lb),
           -with bone and rind
           Water
    3/4 c  Sherry (dry)
           -or Shaoxing wine
    1/3 c  Dark soy sauce
           Chinese yellow rock sugar,
           -6 crystals (each crystal
           -about 1 inch square)
  1 1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
      6    Star anise cloves
      1    Cinnamon stick
           -(about 2 inches long)
      4 sm Chili peppers,
           -dried (optional)
           Tangerine peel, dried,
           -3 pieces (optional)
      6    Garlic cloves (crushed)
      4 sl Ginger (thick)
      1    Scallion (whole), trimmed
      2    Spinach bunches, washed
 
  Put the pork in a large pot with water to cover. Bring to a boil,
  simmer for 2 minutes, then drain and rinse. Again add the pork to the
  pot with fresh water to cover, add the wine, and bring to a boil.
  Turn the heat to medium, partially cover, and cook for 30 minutes.
  Add the rest of the ingredients (except the spinach), and simmer the
  pork for another 2 1/2 to 3 hours. The rind and the fat should be
  very soft when it's done.
  
  Remove the pork from the liquid and keep it warm. Strain the sauce
  into a large skillet and reduce it over high heat. This may take a
  while, depending on how much liquid you end up with.
  
  Meanwhile, steam the spinach until just wilted, salt it lightly, and
  keep it warm. When the sauce is reduced (it should be the consistency
  of a thin syrup), put the pork shoulder in the center of a large
  platter, arrange the spinach around it, and pour the sauce over.

      Title: RED CABBAGE WITH APPLES
 Categories: Entrees
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Red cabbage
      6 tb Bacon fat or butter
           -(or less)
      1    Onion, finely chopped
      1 c  Red wine, dry
      2    Apples, tart, cored
           -and diced (not peeled)
      2 tb Brown sugar
      1 tb Wine vinegar
    1/2 ts Caraway seeds
 
  Discard the outer leaves of a firm,  3-lb red cabbage, and cut it in
  half. Shred finely and soak in salted water for 15 minutes. Drain
  well.
  
  Heat the bacon fat or butter in a large, heavy skillet and add 1
  finely chopped onion.  Cook onion until transparent, about 5 minutes,
  then add cabbage.  Toss well with two wooden spoons, as you would a
  salad. When cabbage starts to wilt, add salt and freshly ground black
  pepper to taste, and red wine.
  
  Simmer for 5 minutes and then add 2 tart apples, cored and diced, but
  not peeled.  Sprinkle with brown sugar, and add wine vinegar and
  caraway seeds. Cover, with lid slightly askew, and simmer over low
  heat for about 45 minutes. Serves 8 and is good hot or cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A fruity cabbage saute -- I just tried this recipe from a column
  in the local paper.  It's good winter food, very satisfying on a cold
  nasty day. My only caveat is to use a *large* skillet, or halve the
  recipe. I cooked a full batch and had cabbage overflowing onto the
  stove.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Side dishes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Red cabbage; shredded
      6 tb Butter
      1 lb Green apples; quartered
    1/2 lb Onions; sliced
      2    Cl Garlic; finely chopped
    1/4 ts Nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon,
      1    Grated orange rind; (opt.)
    1/4 c  Brown sugar, packed
      2 tb Wine vinegar
  1 1/4 c  Dry red wine
 
  Recipe by: dz234@cleveland.freenet.edu (Helen B. Greenleaf) Cook
  cabbage in butter in covered pan for 5 minutes. In a casserole dish,
  layer 1/3 of the cabbage, apples, onions, garlic and spices. Repeat
  three times until all those ingredients are used. Sprinkle brown
  sugar over top and add vinegar and wine. Cover and bake at 300 - 350
  degrees F until tender. Add more wine if necessary.
  
   Note:  once you've made it, you can adjust the seasonings, etc. It is
  absolutely one of our favorites with pork or duck. My German friends
  used bacon grease instead of the butter, so that's another option.

  Scrub the clams and discard any open ones.  Clams that have a strong
  odor or are heavy (indicating that they contain sand) are likely to
  be dead and should also be discarded. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
  F. Roast the dried chiles in a large skillet, over medium-high heat,
  for 4 to 5 minutes, turning frequently to avoid burning. Remove the
  stems and seeds and place the chiles in a large bowl. Pour boiling
  water over them, cover, and let sit until they are very soft, about
  40 minutes. Roast the pine nuts in the oven for about 8 minutes or
  until golden, stirring occasionally. Place the chiles, roasted
  garlic, lemon zest, 1/4 cup of olive oil, and oregano in a food
  processor or blender and puree until smooth. Add the remaining 1/4
  cup of olive oil and blend thoroughly. Add the pine nuts and process
  until coarsely chopped.  Season to taste with lime juice. Place the
  clams in a large pan, over medium-high heat, with the fish stock or
  clam juice. When the clams open, remove them from the cooking liquid.
  Reduce the liquid by half, then whisk in the chile pesto. To serve,
  divide clams, evenly between four soup bowls, pour the pesto mixture
  over them, and garnish with coriander leaves. Serve immediately.

  cheese should be finely ground or grated.
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++++++
  
  Scrub the clams and discard any dead ones, (See Recipe 16). In a wide
  bottomed stainless steel or enamel pan, place the sliced garlic,
  parsley, 4 cups of water, wine, and the clams in a single layer.
  Cover and bring to a boil, simmer over low heat until the clams open
  up, no more than 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn the heat off and let sit for a
  further 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the clams from the broth and extract
  the meat from the shells. Open any clam shells that remain closed
  with a knife over a separate bowl, in case any are bad. Allow the
  broth to cool, remove the garlic and parsley, and strain, if
  necessary to remove sand or other foreign particles. Combine the
  broth with enough clam juice to equal 11 cups of liquid. Saute the
  onion with 3 tb of butter, over medium heat in a large pan, until
  soft, about 15 minutes.  Add the rice and cook for 5 minutes, over
  medium heat, stirring constantly (Cooking any longer will make the
  rice tough). Add 2 cups each of water and clam juice, alternating 1
  cup of water, 1 cup of juice, stirring continuously. This should be
  absorbed after about 10 minutes or so, then add, alternately in 1/2
  cup increments, 2 cups of water and 1 cup of clam juice, stir and
  allow to absorb for another 5 to 10 minutes. At this stage the rice
  should be about 1/2 cooked. (If preparing this dish ahead of time,
  stop at this point and lay out the rice on a long flat sheet pan to
  prevent it gumming together.) Add the minced garlic, tomatoes, and
  chile powder and continue stirring and cooking over medium heat for
  10 minutes.  Then add a further 4 cups of clam juice, 1/2 cup at a
  time.  Add the peppers and add another 3 cups of clam juice, in 1/4
  cup increments and allow to absorb for 8 to 10 minutes. Add the clams
  and the remaining 1 cup of clam juice in 1/4 cup increments and allow
  the liquid to absorb for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the pan from the
  heat, stir in the remaining butter and cheese and garnish with
  parsley sprinkled on top. Serve hot.

      2 tb Medium sherry
      1 ts Ground bean sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar
           Cornstarch paste
 
  A fatty cut of beef gives this dish more beef flavor, which is the
  point of the dish; rich, mellow, gently seasoned.
  
  Red-Cooking Meat:   In medium hot wok, toast peppercorns until fra-
  grant (avoid burning); crush & finely mince with cleaver; reserve.
  Cut beef into 1 1/2" chunks. Heat cooking oil in hot wok until it
  starts to smoke; brown beef in several batches; drain oil & discard.
  Combine peppercorns & remaining ingredients of red-cooking liquid;
  add to wok. Bring to boil; reduce heat & simmer, covered, for 1 1/2
  to 2 hours, until meat is very tender.  (If liquid evaporates before
  meat is tender, add cup of water or stock and continue cooking.)
  Remove meat from liquid. If desired, cool meat, cover and refrigerate.
  
  Boiling Noodles:  Bring 4 qts. water to rolling boil; add noodles.
  Drain when still slightly undercooked.
  
  Stir-frying:  Heat peanut oil in hot wok.  When oil starts to smoke,
  add scallions & stir-fry until fragrant. Add garlic, ginger & Napa
  cabbage; stir-fry for about 1 minute, until cabbage is slightly wilt-
  ed. Add meat & all gravy ingredients except cornstarch paste. Reduce
  heat to medium, cover, & simmer for about 3 minutes. Remove cover;
  dribble in enough cornstarch paste to make a light gravy; not too
  heavy as you want to coat noodles, but not too soupy either. Turn up
  heat; when sauce returns to boil, add noodles. Toss to mix (& reheat)
  noodles. Transfer to warmed serving platter or large bowl.

  To use these sauces: bring them to a slow boil in a large kettle. Add
  meat or poultry, return to slow boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cook
  until done. Drain meat and serve with some sauce (optionally
  thickened with cornstarch-water) on the side. Save and reuse leftover
  sauce, which gets richer with each use. Leftover sauce should be
  salted lightly, boiled a few minutes, skimmed, and cooled before
  storage in the refrigerator. If it is to be kept a long time it
  should be boiled and skimmed once in awhile.

      Title: RED CREEK GOURMET BEEF JERKEY ROUNDS
 Categories: Meats, Preserving
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      5 lb Whole eye of round
      7 oz Red Creek Jerky Marinade
           Coarse ground black pepper
           Large bowl
           -OR-
           Gallon-size zip lock bags
           Wax paper
           Rolling Pin
           Dehydrator
           -OR- Conventional Oven
           Aluminum Foil if using oven
 
  This recipe is from the Red Creek Marinade Company
  
  1. Place meat slices into a large bowl or a gallon-sized zip lock
  freezer bag. Pour 1 to 1 1/2 oz. Red Creek Jerkey Marinade per pound
  of meat over the slices. Be sure to vigorously shake the bottle of
  marinade prior to pouring.
  
  2. Work marinade into meat so that each slice is thoroughly exposed to
  marinade and place in refrigerator for three to four hours. At this
  stage, slices can be marinated up to 24 hours if desired. Meat should
  absorb all of marinade. If not, use a colander to drain any remaining
  marinade from meat.
  
  3. If additional black pepper is desired, lay meat slices out flat on
  waxed paper, sprinkle with coarsely ground black pepper and roll
  pepper in to the surface of the meat slices with a rolling pin or
  "pat" it in by hand.
  
  4. Continue with either the dehydrator method or oven method of
  drying to the jerky stage.
  
  Dehydrator Method:
  
  Place marinated meat slices on dehydrator racks and dry to jerky stage
  according to dehydrator manufacturer's diredtions. Length of drying
  time will depend on size and type of dehydrator used, and whether or
  not your dehydrator is constructed with a heating element only or
  with both a heating element and fan. If your dehydrator has a
  temperature gauge, dry at its maximum setting (but no more that 165
  degrees). Check drying process periodically. It may be necessary to
  rearrange placement of racks to insure even drying of meat slices.
  
  Oven Method:
  
  Place a layer of heavy duty aluminum foil or a large jelly roll pan
  on the bottom oven rack to catch any drips or black pepper. Heat oven
  to 165 degrees and place marinated meat slices in single layer
  directly on oven racks. Dry meat slices with oven door slightyly ajar
  so that moisture can escape, turning occasionally until meat is dried
  to jerky stage.
  
  Things to remember:
  
  The thicker the meat is sliced, the longer the drying process will be.
  
  Finish jerky yield will be less than raw meat yield.
  
  Unless dried to 0 moisture level, refrigerate finished product.

      4    Pork loin chops; about 4 oz.
    3/4 ts Rubbed sage
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
           Vegetable spray; (e.g. pam)
    1/4 c  Red currant jelly
      2 tb Balsamic vinegar
 
  Recipe by: Kelly Day Rubenstein <KDAY@ERS.BITNET> Trim fat from chops.
  Sprinkle with sage, pepper and salt on both sides of chops. Coat a
  non-stick skillet with cooking spray, place over medium heat until hot
  (provided your cookware allows this - mine doesn't so I put the chops
  in cold.)  Add chops, and cook for 7 minutes on each side, until
  done. Remove chops, keep warm.
  
  Add jelly and vinegar to skillet and cook until thickened (about 2
  mintues), stirring constantly. Spoon over chops.
  
  Note: being paranoid about food-borne illness, I kept the chops in the
  skillet while making the sauce (extra cooking time). They still
  turned out great

      Title: RED CURRY SAUCE
 Categories: Condiments, Spices, Sauces, Thai
      Yield: 1 1/2 cups
 
           RED CURRY SAUCE
      1 tb Fried garlic in oil
      1 tb Fried shallots in oil
      4 tb Red prik kaeng (chili paste)
      1 c  Coconut milk
      2 tb Prik chi fa daeng
           (red jalapenas),
           Sliced finely
      2 tb 'ginger'
      2 tb Fish sauce
           Pinch of sugar
 
  The common thread of all these is to prepare a sauce base. Similar
  sauces can be made from any Thai curry paste: the basic method is
  simple: the paste is fried, dissolved in coconut milk, and a
  colorant, taste extender and flavor element are added.
  
  Note fried garlic in oil and fried shallots in oil are so basic that
  most Thai cooks keep some ready made. It will keep in the fridge for
  two or three months. It is best made in a small deep fat frier.
  
  However if you don't have any put a tablespoon of oil in a medium hot
  wok and stir fry a tablespoon of garlic (or shallots) until they just
  change color and the oil becomes aromatic. RED CURRY SAUCE
  
  In a wok heat (or cook) the garlic and shallots, and add the prik
  kaeng, and stir until combined and aromatic. In a wok push it up the
  side of pan away from the heat. If you are using a saucepan remove
  and set aside.
  
  Heat the coconut milk until nearly boiling and lower the heat. Add the
  chili paste, a quarter at a time, and stir until dissolved.
  
  Now add the remaining ingredients, and stir until heated through.
  
  You can increase or reduce the shallots/garlic and chili paste
  together by a factor of two (ie if you halve the chili paste, halve
  the garlic and shallots also. If you double them double them all).
  Similarly the jalapenas, ginger and fish sauce can be adjusted by up
  to a factor of two to give the flavor balance you want.
  
  'ginger' gives the dish and afterburn. You can use any mixture of
  khing (common green ginger), kha (galangal), or kachai (lesser
  ginger) you wish. Walt Colonel Ian F. Khuntilanont-Philpott

  depending on size of potatoes.  Turn a few times during baking. Can be
  baked several hours ahead and kept at room temperature.
  
  4.  To serve, sprinkle with salt and place over hot barbecue fire

      2 tb Parsley
      2 ea Bay leaves
    1/2 c  Tomatoes, finely chopped
      3 ts Tomato paste
      1 c  Red kidney beans, soaked
      7 c  Vegetable stock
           Salt & pepper
    1/2 tb Nutritional yeast, optional+
 
  Heat oil in a large soup pot.  Stir in the onions, garlic and carrots.
  Cover & sweat over low heat for 5 minutes. Add the chiles and herbs,
  stir well & continue to cook, covered, for a further 5 minutes. Stir
  in the tomatoes, tomato paste & kidney beans. Mix well, ensure that
  the heat is very low, & cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Pour in the stock, season with salt & pepper & bring to
  a boil. When at a full rolling boil, let it boil hard for 5 minutes,
  then reduce the heat & simmer until the beans are tender. The length
  of time will vary, depending upon the age of the beans, from 50
  minutes, to 2 hours. When cooked, turn off the heat, stir in the
  nutritional yeast, if desired & let cool.
  
  Once cool, transfer the soup, in batches, to a food processor or
  blender & blend until very smooth. Return to a clean pot & gently
  re-heat. Serve with good, home-made bread.  It will also work with a
  good, hearty flat bread, if that's not too much of a contradiction in
  terms. Try a Native flat bread, for example.
  
  * I'm experimenting with fresh chiles rather than dry ones, I find the
  flavour to be intense, but I find that I may be over doing the
  quantities, so reduce the amount if you prefer less hot food. If you
  do not have fresh, a good guideline is to use dried in the following
  quantities: 1 dried chile gives a mild flavour; 2 give a medium heat;
  3 will be hot; then there's people like me & others who will go up
  from there, depending upon taste. The trick is to use only enough
  chiles so that the other tastes are not masked.
  
  + This is optional.  It's another area of experimenting. I find that a
  little nutritional yeast in pureed foods, or in "cream" sauces, gives
  added creaminess to dishes.  It is entirely up to the cook.

      3    Cloves Garlic, minced
      1    Red chili, deseeded
      2    Stalks Celery, chopped
           *very* finely (because my
           Wife hates it)
    1/2 c  Water
      1 lb Broccoli
      1 sm Courgette/Zucchini
    1/2 lb Mushroom
      1 pt Vegetable Stock (Vecon and
           Water)
      1 c  Red lentils
      1 cn Tomatoes
      2 ts Oregano
      2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/2 c  Corn
      2 tb Tomato Puree/Paste
     12    Sheets Spinach lasagna
    1/4 c  Water
      2 tb Flour
    3/4 c  Soya milk
      1    Clove Garlic
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      3 tb Yeast flakes
    1/4 ts Turmeric
 
  Steam onions, garlic, chilli and celery in the half cup of water. Add
  stalks of the broccoli, the courgette and the mushrooms and simmer for
  about five minutes. Add the stock, the canned tomatoes, the herbs,
  salt and pepper, the lentils and the broccoli flowerets. Simmer till
  the lentils are tender. Add the corn and the tomato puree. The
  resulting mixture should be fairly sloppy still because it has to go
  into the oven for 20 minutes.
  
  In another pan stir the flour into the cold 1/4 cup of water till a
  paste is made. Put on the heat and slowly add the soya milk making
  sure to avoid lumps. Add the crushed clove of garlic, some salt and
  pepper, the yeast flakes and the turmeric. You should end up with a
  pourable cheeze sauce.
  
  Layer the mixture with the lasagna sheets (I used no-boil spinach
  lasagna) finishing with a layer of lasagna sheets. Cover with the
  cheeze sauce and stick in the oven at about 170 deg. C (330 deg. F)
  for 20 minutes. Eat with a salad.

      5 lb Bisquick
     44 oz ;Water, cold
      1 lb Cheddar, sharp; grated
    1/2 c  Butter
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
  large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
  After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
  with garlic powder, parsley flakes and Italian seasoning. (Amounts
  will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
  Serve hot. The RL manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
  have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you
  desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2
  cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12
  biscuits. You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the
  water, if desired.

  at try. The basic recipe is broken down for household rather than

  However, you cannot make the EXACT biscuits, because they have a

 Categories: Breads, Rolls, Quick, Copycat
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Garlic salt -- or powder

  My Notes: When the Red Lobster restaurant that we go to started
  serving their cheese rolls, I managed to talk the manager out of this
  recipe. It's been posted numerous times since 3/90 by me and by
  Elaine Radis and others. The quantities I've given are as the manager
  gave me. Later, I cut the ingredient quantities down to be more
  useable by the average family. These do freeze, however, so it's
  worthwhile making the larger batch and freezing the ones you do not
  plan to use immediately.
  
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
  large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
  After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
  with garlic powder, parsley flakes and Italian seasoning. (Amounts
  will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
  Serve hot. The RL manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll

    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1    Pinch salt
      3 tb Stick margarine, chilled

    1/4 ts Garlic powder
 
  1. Preheat oven to 450F. Line baking sheet with parchment or waxed
  paper; spray with nonstick cooking spray.
  
  2. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, soda and
  salt. Add 2 tablespoons of the margarine and blend with pastry cutter
  until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add buttermilk and cheese;
  combine with fork, handling dough as little as possible. Drop by
  spoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet; bake until lightly browned,
  about 8-10 minutes.
  
  3. While biscuits are baking, in a small microwavable bowl, add
  remaining tablespoon margarine; microwave on high until margarine is
  melted. Stir in garlic powder; set aside.
  
  4. When biscuits are done, remove from oven and brush margarine
  mixture evenly over the warm biscuits. Remove from baking sheet and
  serve immediately.

 Categories: Breads, Copycat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     16 oz Very finely shredded
           -Cheddar cheese
      6 c  Water
      5 lb Box of Bisquick Mix
           -Garlic butter,
           -soft or melted
 
  Mix together cheese, water and Bisquick in a large bowl. Drop onto a
  non-stick cookie sheet or one that is covered with aluminum foil. You
  will need to experiment with size but they should turn out to be
  about the size of a normal biscuit (about 2" in diameter??). Bake at
  400 degrees until golden (sorry, don't have the cooking time. Perhaps
  the Bisquick box can help).  Right after you remove the rolls from
  the oven, spread or brush VERY GENEROUSLY with garlic butter (soft or
  melted butter with lots of finely diced or crushed garlic mixed in).
  Serve rolls warm.
  
  Note:  I have no idea how many rolls this makes so you may want to
  cut it down unless you plan on feeding a herd!

      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Mayonnaise
      1 tb Sugar**
      2 c  Self-rising flour*
    1/4 c  Kraft American Cheese**
    1/2 ts Garlic POWDER -- not salt
      3 tb Melted butter or margarine
           Muffin paper liners
 
  *You may use all-purpose (regular) flour, however biscuits will not
  rise much and have a denser texture; flavors should be about
  identical. **Can substitute 3 packets of Sweet & Low for the sugar.
  Use the cheese in the gold cardboard container. Original recipe does
  not say, but I would think you will want to shred it.
  
  In a 1 1/2 qt mixing bowl combine the milk, mayo, sugar, and flour.
  Beat on high speed with electric mixer for almost a minute, until
  smooth and completely combined. Using a rubber bowl scraper, streak
  the dough with the cheese. Batter should NOT be thin enough to pour;
  if necessary, add only enough additional flour so batter will "drop"
  from spoon. Drop batter into 10 paper-lined muffin tins, or a greater
  number of tiny muffin cups. (Muffins tend to triple in size when
  baked; fill lightly.) Melt butter; mix in garlic, and brush tops of
  dough. You may shake 1 tsp additional cheese on each muffin if you
  wish. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden. Cool in pan on rack
  for 30 minutes.
  
  These definitely should be served freshly baked and hot.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Baking mix (RL uses a
           -specially made product, but
           -Bisquick buttermilk baking
           -mix is a decent substitute)
      6 oz Grated mild cheddar cheese
     21 oz Cold water
 
  Mix together above ingredients (by hand, an electric mixer will NOT
  work) until JUST combined --do not overmix. Scoop with a 1 1/2 ounce
  scoop onto 2 parchment-lined baking sheets (20 per sheet), and bake
  in a 450 convection oven for 4-5 minutes.  Rotate the sheets, and
  bake another 4-5 minutes. (Note, a commercial convection oven cooks
  about 25 percent faster than a home oven -- for the same results,
  increase the baking time somewhat, but be careful not to overbrown
  the rolls, they should be a light golden brown). Remove rolls from
  the oven, and brush with garlic butter mixture (again, RL uses a
  proprietary product, but you can make a decent imitation by adding
  garlic powder, NOT salt) to taste, plus some dehydrated parsley
  flakes to liquid margarine. Do not add too much butter to the rolls,
  or the garlic flavor will overpower the cheese. For variations,
  increase the cheese to 8 oz. (better, and the way the Lobster used to
  do it), or substitute about 5 oz. shredded Parmesan (NOT the dried
  stuff that comes in a can) for the cheddar. The Parmesan variation is
  excellent. IMHO, better than the original. As a breakfast bread (or
  snack for the cook), you may also add 4-5 slices of crisp cooked
  bacon to this. In this case, brush with regular liquid margarine
  instead of garlic butter.

      Title: RED PEPPER & GINGER MARMALADE
 Categories: Condiments, Jams
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Red bell peppers; (12 mediu
           -m to large peppers)
    1/2    Unsalted butter; (4 tablesp
           -oons)
    1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
     10    Cl Garlic; minced (about 3 r
           -nded tablespoons)
    1/2 c  Fresh ginger; coarsely grat
           -ed
           Grated zest of 3 oranges
    3/4 c  Fresh orange juice
      3 tb Sugar
      2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  1.  Core and seed the peppers, and cut them into 1/4-inch wide
  lengthwise strips (you should have 12 cups). 2. Heat the butter and
  oil in a heavy flameproof casserole.  Add the garlic and ginger, and
  cook over low heat for 5 minutes.  Add the peppers, and stir well to
  coat. 3. Mix in the orange zest, juice, sugar and pepper. Stir gently
  and cover. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until
  the peppers are wilted and their skins are soft, 25 minutes. 4.
  Remove the cover and continue cooking over low heat, stirring
  frequently, until most of the liquid has evaporated, 2 hours. 5.
  Serve hot or at room temperature. This keeps, covered tightly, in the
  refrigerator for up to 4 days. Makes 4 cups. Authors' note: This is a
  slightlyb swet condiment with a bite to it. Great served with grilled
  chicken or bef, sausages, lamb, on a sandwich, in a potato, or with
  game. Try to always have some on hand--it's addictive. Source: The

      Title: RED PEPPER PESTO
 Categories: Condiments
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 oz Sun-dried tomatoes
  1 1/3 c  Sweet red peppers;roast/chop
    1/2 c  Kalamata olive;pitted/choppd
    1/3 c  Flat-leaf parsley; chopped
    1/3 c  Basil, fresh; finely chopped
      3    Cloves garlic; minced
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Balsamic vinegar
           Fresh-ground black pepper
           Salt to taste
 
  Put the sun-dried tomatoes into a bowl and pour boiling water over
  them just to cover. Leave them to soak for 20-30 minutes.
  
  If using canned peppers, rinse and drain them well, and blot them on
  paper towels, then chop them pretty finely. Combine them with the
  chopped Kalamata olives, the chopped fresh herbs, and the minced
  garlic.
  
  Drain the sun-dried tomatoes, reserving the water, and press them
  gently in a colander. Pulse them in a food processor until they are
  finely chopped. (Don't use the food processor for the other
  ingredients, as it can too easily turn them into mush, and you want
  to keep a little texture in this spread.) Add the olive oil and
  vinegar, pulse again, scraping down as needed, until no large chunks
  of tomato are left.
  
  If you do not have a food processor, just finely chop the soaked
  sun-dried tomatoes as you do all the other ingredients. It will only
  take a little longer.
  
  Combine the tomato mixture with the other ingredients, mix well, and
  taste. Grind in some black pepper if you like, and add some salt if
  needed, though probably the olives provide enough. If the pesto is
  too thick for your taste, moisten it with a few drops of the reserved
  tomato water until it has the consistency you like. The texture
  should be somewhere between thick pesto and soft pate.

 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6    Red peppers
    1/2    Bulb of garlic
        x  Basil
 
  It was really very simple. I cut about 6 red peppers in strips and
  placed them on a cookie sheet. I placed about 1/2 bulb of garlic
  (don't peel the cloves) in some foil and put all of this in the oven
  on 425 for about a half hour. (The tips of the peppers were just
  starting to look charred, so I took them out.) I let them cool for a
  while then tossed peppers and garlic into the food processor with a
  little basil and zapped. (Be sure to peel the garlic before zapping.)
  
  This mixture adds a lot of flavor to an ordinary tomato sauce or it
  can be used by itself. Yum!

      Title: RED PEPPER SWORDFISH
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Swordfish steaks
           -(each about 1/2 lb
           -and about 1 inch thick)
      1 lg Sweet red pepper
      2    Lemons
      3 tb Oregano, fresh
      1 c  Olive oil
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper,
           -fresh ground
           White wine, dry
 
  Remove seeds and ribs from pepper and cut into 1/4 inch cubes. Put in
  a bowl and mix well with the juice of the two lemons, the olive oil,
  salt, pepper and the oregano.
  
  Heat broiler and pour wine to a depth of about 1/8 inch in a broiler
  pan. Lay swordfish steaks in wine and broil for 3 minutes. Pour the
  seasoned lemon, oil and oregano mixture over the fish and cook for 3
  to 4 minutes more (until fish is cooked through and lightly browned.)
  Immediately transfer fish to a warmed serving dish.
  
  You may need to reduce the sauce slightly by boiling vigorously and
  stirring for 2 minutes more. Pour sauce over fish and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Swordfish steaks cooked with sweet red peppers -- This recipe was
  handed out to people buying swordfish at my local fishmonger; I tried
  it and it was delicious. It is also very quick and simple to make.
  
  *  I served fresh asparagus with this, but any light vegetable would
  be fine. Boiled new potatoes would be nice, too.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes.

      Title: RED PEPPER-SEMOLINA BREAD FROM BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      1 tb Rice yeast, SAF instant one
      1 tb Dough enhancer
      2 c  Warm water, 105 F to 115 F
      2 c  Semolina flour
      2 lg Red bell peppers,
           Roasted & peeled
      4 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           Or bread flour
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Salt
 
  1. Combine yeast, dough enhancer, water, semolina flour, red peppers,
  2 cups of the unbleached flour and the oil in a heavy duty mixer
  bowl. Mix just until ingredients are combined. Cover loosely and let
  sponge for 15 minutes. 2. Add the salt. 3. With mixer on low speed
  and using the remainder of the unbleached flour, add just enough
  flour until the sides of the bowl are cleaned by the dough. The dough
  should still be soft & sticky. 4. Knead on low speed for 7 minutes.
  The dough will no longer be sticky but elastic. 5. Turn dough out
  onto a lightly greased surface & form into two loaves. Place into 2
  greased pans or onto a greased baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal,
  if desired. Let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. 6. Bake in a
  preheated 350 F oven for about 35-40 minutes. I substituted an equal
  amount of applesauce for the oil and used jarred roasted red peppers
  from Trader Joe's and used freshly milled Golden 86 flour instead of
  unbleached flour.

  2 1/2 lb New potatoes, scrubbed
  1 1/2 lb Green beans
    1/3 c  Herb vinegar
    1/3 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      1 ts Paprika

      1    Medium sweet red pepper
      6    Scallions (half green tops)
      1    Bunch parsley
    1/2 ts Black pepper, or to taste
 
  To prepare dressing, in blender container combine herb vinegar, olive
  oil, vegetable oil, granulated sugar, paprika, salt, garlic, dry
  mustard, caraway seeds, and celery seeds. Blend until well
  emulsified.
  
  Cut green beans on the diagonal in 1-1/2-inch pieces and cook in a
  large pot of boiling water until just tender-crisp. Refresh in cold
  water, drain and pat dry.
  
  Cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling water until just tender
  when pierced with aknife, 12-15 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Allow the
  potatoes to cool slightly. Slice potatoes into 1/4-inch thick slices,
  drizzling a small amount of dressing over potato slices and tossing
  to coat as you slice.
  
  Add green beans to potato slices and toss to combine, drizzling a
  small amount of dressing to coat.
  
  Dice red pepper, chop scallions and parsley, and add with remaining
  ingredients and toss to combine, drizzling just enough additional
  dressing to evenly coat salad. Grind black pepper over salad to taste
  and lightly toss again. Taste and adjust seasonings.
  
  Salad is best if eaten the same day it is made - slightly warm or at
  room temperature - do not refrigerate! Leftovers should be
  refrigerated, but may be warmed slightly in the microwave before
  serving.
  
  NOTE: I use Soleillou Radiant Wine Herb Vinegar which contains white
  wine vinegar, cloves, thyme, rosemary, fennel, bay laurel leaves,
  basil, and marjoram. This is available from Balducci's, New York
  City.
  
  A reasonable substitute could probably be made by steeping these
  herbs in white wine vinegar for a few weeks before using.

           Salt
           Black pepper ;feshly ground
      2    Eggs ;hard boiled
 
  Wash the potatoes and drain.  Using a paring knife, trim a band of
  the peel about 1/2 inch wide (depending on the size of the potatoes)
  around the circumference of each potato. This will form an attractive
  "belt". Boil the trimmed potatoes gently in ample, lightly salted
  water until just tender. The potatoes are done as soon as they pierce
  easily with a sharp knife. Carefully drain, spread on a tray, and
  allow to cool. Cook the bacon in a medium sized frying pan until
  almost crip. Add the onion and cook until limp. Drain off any excess
  fat. Place the cooled potatoes in a bolw along with the cooked bacon
  and onion, and the scallions. In another bowl, blend together the
  mayonnaise, dry mustard, vinegar, oil and salt and pepper to taste
  add to the bowl of potatoes and toss together. Fold in the
  hard-boiled eggs. Cover and refrigerate. Serves 4 to 6.

      Title: RED RASPBERRY TART
 Categories: New text im, Desserts
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           THE CRUST:  makes two 8-10
           Inch tarts
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Granulated sugar --
           Optional
      1 c  Cold unsalted butter -- cut
           Into small piece
    1/4 c  To 1/2 cup ice water
           THE FILLING:
      1 pt Heavy cream
    1/3 c  Quince syrup -- (below)
      3 pt Fresh red raspberries
           THE GLAZE:
    1/4 c  Quince jelly (below) --
           Melted and cooled
           Slightly
           QUINCE JELLY: (makes appr. 2
           Pints)
      4 c  Quinces -- stemmed, seeded,
           And
           Cut up
           Granulated sugar
           QUINCE SYRUP:
      4 c  Quinces, stemmed, seeded,
           And cut up
           Granulated sugar
 
  To make crust: All ingredients should be cold. Put flour, salt and
  sugar in the bowl of a food processor. Add butter and process for
  approximately 10 seconds, or just until the mixture resembles coarse
  meal. Add ice water, drop by drop, through the feed tube with the
  machine running, just until the dough holds together without being
  wet or sticky. (Don't process more than 30 seconds.) Test the dough
  by squeezing a small amount together. If it's crumbly, add a bit more
  water.
  
  Turn half the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Grasping
  the ends of the plastic wrap with your hands, cover dough with the
  plastic and press it into into a flat circle with your fists. Repeat
  process with other half. Wrap dough in the plastic and chill for at
  least an hour.
  
  Lightly butter (or spray with vegetable cooking spray) an 8-inch
  heart-shaped tart pan.
  
  On a lightly floured board, roll out one of the pastry circles to a
  thickness of 1/8 inch. Place the pastry in the pan, which has been
  set on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and press it into the bottom
  edges and along the sides. Trim pastry with scissors. (I often cut
  the pastry an inch higher than the pan's edge and tuck this overhang
  to the inside of the pan for extra height and reinforcement.) Crimp
  edges. Chill until ready to use. Repeat process with second pastry
  circle. If you plan to make only one tart, freeze this unbaked shell
  for future use.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cover the pastry with aluminum foil and
  then carefully press foil into the corners and edges to form a
  lining. Weight with ceramic or aluminum weights. (Or use uncooked
  beans or rice.)
  
  Bake for 25 minutes. When pastry begins to color around the edges,
  remove foil and weights and continue baking until the pastry turns a
  deep amber color. Cool completely before filling.
  
  To make Quince Jelly: Cook quinces with enough water to cover until
  very soft. Pour into a jelly bag (or fine linen dishcloth). Let the
  juice drip through without squeezing or pressing. To each cup of
  juice add 1 cup sugar. Bring to a boil and, while keeping at a full
  rolling boil, skim off any scum. Cook until jelly coats a metal
  spoon. Store in coveredjars in refrigerator.
  
  To make Quince Syrup: Proceed as for jelly, but cook the juice only
  until the liquid begins to thicken. The mixture should remain liquid
  and should not jell.
  
  To make filling: Whip the cream until soft peaks form. Add syrup and
  whip until stiff. Spread cream evenly in tart shell. Carefully
  arrange half the raspberries on top of cream. Make a neat second
  layer with remaining berries. Lightly glaze berries with melted
  quince jelly. Serve immediately.

      Title: RED RICE 2
 Categories: Side dish
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 md Onion, cut into 1/4" dice
      1 tb Finely chopped garlic
      2 c  Long-grain rice
      1 cn Peeled plum tomatoes,
           -drained and crushed (28 oz)
      4 c  Vegetable broth or defatted
           -chicken broth
           Salt to taste

           -to taste
     10 oz Frozen green peas, defrosted
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped flat-leaf
           -parsley
 
  Using vegetable broth makes this a perfect dish for vegetarians, but
  defatted chicken broth lends great flavor to the rice too. If you use
  frozen peas, don't cook them before adding to the rice. Let them
  defrost at room temperatur. Or put the peas in a strainer and run
  under hot water.
  
  1. Place olive oil in a large, heavy pot over low heat. Add onion and
  cook, stirring, until wilted, about 10-12 minutes. Add garlic and
  cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more.
  
  2. Add rice and stir to coat. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
  
  3. Stir in tomatoes and add broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring
  to a boil, stir, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, covered, for
  20 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed.
  
  4. When rice is cooked, fold in peas and parsley. Serve hot.

 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Fresh red snapper filets
           Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper
           Flour for dredging
      4 tb Olive oil

      6    Ripe tomatoes, peeled,
           -seeded & chopped
      2 tb Finely chopped fresh herbs
           -(oregano, thyme & chervil)
      1    Ripe avocado
      1 ts Lime juice
      1 ds Tabasco

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
      1    Beurre Manie*
      1 tb Tomato paste

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Avocado slices
           Lime slices
           Fresh mint leaves
 
  * Beurre Manie is used to thicken sauces.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T
  sweet butter on a small flat plate and blend the mixture with a fork
  into a very smooth paste. Roll the paste into a ball. Preheat oven to
  350 degrees. Season the fish filets with salt and pepper and dredge
  them lightly with flour, shaking off the excess. Heat the olive oil
  in a large skillet and saute the filets over high heat for 2 or 3
  minutes on each side. Remove them carefully to a flameproof baking
  dish large enough to hold the fish in one layer. In the same oil,
  saute the shallots and 2 cloves of garlic. When the shallots are
  lightly browned, add the tomatoes and cook the mixture for 2 minutes.
  Pour the mixture together with the herbs on top of the fish and cover
  the disk with buttered wax paper. Bake in the oven for 25 to 30
  minutes. While the fish is baking, mash the avocado in a small mixing
  bowl, adding lime juice, salt, pepper, a little Tabasco, and the
  remaining clove of garlic. Do not mash it too fine; it should have
  some small chunks left in it. When the fish is ready, lift it out
  carefully onto a platter. Place the baking dish over direct heat and
  reduce the juices by 1/3. If a Beurre Manie is used for thickening,
  add it bit by bit before adding the avocado puree. Add the optional
  tomato paste. Lower the heat and beat in the mashed avocado. Once the
  avocado puree has been added, do not let the mixture come to a boil.
  Correct the seasoning and pour the sauce over the fish. Garnish with
  avocado slices, lime slices and mint leaves.

       quarter of the scallops, shrimp, and mussels around each fish.
       Divide the Garlic Marinara in four portions and cover each fish
       with one portion. Place one tablespoon of Cafe de Paris Sauce
       over the Garlic Marinara. Fold foil over, leaving plenty of air
       room. Seal the edges tightly.

  10/6/94, page H16. "The ricado used in this dish is the basis for many
  Yucatan peninsula dishes. The most famous is cochinita pibil; a
  suckling pig, marinated with this spice paste and wrapped in banana
  leaves, baked in a Mayan earth oven called a pib. Large fish and
  venison or other wild game are also baked in pibs. I slather this
  paste on guinea hens and broil them on the rotisserie, or wrap
  marinated chicken breasts or fish fillets in banana leaves with
  slices of orange and steam the packets. One of my favorite appetizers
  is chicken drummettes baked with this recado.

  Yucatan peninsula dishes. The most famous is cochinita pibil; a
  suckling pig, marinated with this spice paste and wrapped in banana
  leaves, baked in a Mayan earth oven called a pib. Large fish and
  venison or other wild game are also baked in pibs. I slather this
  paste on guinea hens and broil them on the rotisserie, or wrap
  marinated chicken breasts or fish fillets in banana leaves with
  slices of orange and steam the packets. One of my favorite appetizers
  is chicken drummettes baked with this recado.

      Title: RED SNAPPER WITH SPRING VEGETABLE VINAIGRETTE
 Categories: Main dish, Fish, Vegetables, Puck
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Red snapper fillets; skin on
           - 3 to 4 oz. each
      3 tb Olive oil
    1/2 bn Basil (fresh); chopped
    1/2 md Red onion; thinly sliced
           Salt
           White pepper; freshly ground

MMMMM-------------------VEGETABLE VINAIGRETTE------------------------
    1/3 c  Olive oil
    1/3 c  Balsamic vinegar
      2 ts Lime juice (fresh)
    1/2 lb Asparagus
      1    Carrot (about 4 oz.); peeled
           -and diced
      4 oz Broccoli flowerets (small)
      1 sm Red bell pepper; cored,
           -seeded, and diced
    1/2 lb Tomatoes (about 2); peeled,
           -seeded and diced
      2 lb Shallots; diced
      1 tb Sun-dried tomatoes*; diced

MMMMM-------------------------EQUIPMENT------------------------------
           Small bowl and larger bowl
           Whisk
           Vegetable peeler
           Fine strainer
           Ovenproof skillet
 
  I created this recipe for a wine dinner at the Rainbow Room in New
  York City.  A crisp sauvignon blanc was the wine that accompanied the
  salad. If you can find small whole red snappers, this would be a
  perfect entree for a warm-weather luncheon.  Stuff the cavity with a
  few sprigs of parsley or tarragon and watch out for bones when
  eating. (WP)
  
  1. Score the fillets with a sharp knife (they will absorb the marinade
  better), arrange on a plate, and spoon over the olive oil. Sprinkle
  with the basil and red onion, and let marinate for 1 hour,
  refrigerated. Just before cooking, season lightly with salt and
  pepper.
  
  2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
  
  3. Prepare the vegetable vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together
  the 1/3 cup olive oil, vinegar, and lime juice. Set aside.
  
  4. With a vegetable peeler, peel away any rough scales on the
  asparagus spears, cut off the hard bottoms, and dice. Blanch the
  asparagus, carrot, broccoli, and red pepper separately. (You can do
  this most easily by placing each vegetable in a fine strainer and
  plunging into boiling salted water for about 2 minutes per
  vegetable.) Cool and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Add the tomatoes,
  shallots, and sun dried tomatoes. Whisk the dressing and, reserving a
  little for the greens, toss the vegetables with the dressing and
  season with salt and pepper to taste.
  
  5. Heat an ovenproof skillet large enough to hold the fillets in one
  layer. Add the 2 teaspoons of olive oil and when it almost begins to
  smoke, lay the fillets in the pan and sear on one side for 1 minute.
  Transfer to the oven and continue to cook 3 to 4 minutes longer. The
  fillets do not need to be flipped.  (Fish should be cooked on the
  outside and a little underdone on the inside.)
  
  6. Toss the greens with the reserved dressing.
  
  Presentation: Divide the greens and mound in the center of 4 large
  serving plates.  Arrange a layer of the vegetable vinaigrette on one
  side of the greens and top with one of the fillets, skin-side down.
  Serve immediately.
  
  To prepare ahead: Have the fish marinating, the salad greens cleaned
  and ready, the vegatables blanced, and continue with the recipe at
  serving time.
  
  *To reconstitute sun-dried tomatoes, steep in boiling water to cover
  until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.

      Title: RED SNAPPER~ VERACRUZ (HUACHINANGO ALA VERACR
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 7 Servings
 
      1    Red Snapper 4 lb.
      2 tb Salt or to taste
      3 tb Lime juice
      3 lb Tomatoes peeled,seeded and
           -chopped (save seed + peel)
      4 tb Olive Oil
      1 lg White Onion sliced thinly
     15    Pitted green Olives
      3 tb Large Capers, drained
      6    Whole chile Largos-canned

  1 1/2 tb Italian, flat leaf Parsley
      1    Sweet Red Pepper-canned or
           Fresh peeled and cut into
           Strips
 
  METHOD: Rinse the fish well in cold water to remove any remaining
  scales. Pierce the flesh on both sides with a sharp fork and rub in
  the lime juice and about 2 tsp of the salt. set the fish aside to
  season in an ovenproof dish into which it will just fit. ( If dish is
  too large the sauce will dry up.) Preheat oven to 350. Heat the oil
  in a heavy frying pan. Add the onions and fry gently, stirring from
  time to time, until they are wilted but not browned. Add the chopped
  tomatoes. Press the seeds and pulp through a strainer to extract all
  the juice and add it with the olives, capers, half of the parsley and
  salt to taste. Cook over a fairly high flame until the sauce is
  well-seasoned and reduced-- about ten minutes. Pour the sauce over
  the fish. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove
  foil, turn the fish over and continue baking, uncovered, basting with
  the sauce from time to time for a further 25 minutes or until fish is
  done. When tested with a fork the flesh should flake easily away from
  the bone. Sprinkle with the rest of the parsley and decorate with the
  strips of red pepper. Serve the fish with plenty of the sauce and hot
  tortillas and/or white rice.

    1/4 c  Baking cocoa

  Red velvet cake also known as the $100 dollar cake, $200 dollar cake,
  or Waldorph Astoria Cake is only a legend as is the Nieman Marcus
  cookies and all are examples of a legend that pits institutions
  against a consumer who feels he/she has been unfairly charged.The
  recipe is a grass roots recipe not an institutional one.
  
  James Beard outlines in his American Cookery that there is really 3
  varieties of red velvet cake, recipes being different in the use of
  butter, vegetable shortening ( crisco ) and oil.Most all call for
  cake flour and buttermilk, baking soda and vinegar for the leaving
  process.
  
  The redness of the cake comes from red food color despite the chemical
  reaction of baking soda, vinegar , buttermilk and cocoa which cause a
  reddish brown color, not red in the cake.
  
  This cake is moist and red with a velvety texture and the flavor
  nondistinctive as is most red velvet cakes. Red Velvet cake is also
  cultural as recipes differ in community cookbooks accross America
  even as to the type of frosting for the cake. The moistest cake is
  one made with oil and cake flour.The amount of food color is up to
  you.Start with 2 teaspoons as a base.
  
  The above recipe comes from:" Celebrating Our Mothers' Kitchen", a
  fundraising cookbook published by The National Council for Negro
  Woman.
  
  Preparation: Grease and flour 2, 9 inch pans and line with paper.In a
  large bowl combine flour, baking soda, cocoa and salt. In another
  bowl with mixer at low speed or spoon beat sugar and oil until
  blended. Add eggs, one at a time to blend well.Blend in food color,
  vanilla and vinegar.Scape bowl down with spatula. Alternately blend
  in flour mixture and buttermilk, using about 1/3 each time and
  scraping bowl down at least twice. Do not beat on high or cake will
  be tough.Pour into prepared pans and bake in a preheated 350 degree
  oven 20 to 25 minutes or tested done with toothpick.Cool on racks 5
  minutes and remove from pan and cool completely.Frost layers when
  cold.Beat cream cheese until softened and smooth. Add butter and
  continue to beat till softened. Beat in sugar a little at a time and
  then vanilla.If too thick blend in cold milk a tablespoon at a time
  till desired consisitency.

      Title: RED'S BARBECUED BRISKET
 Categories: Bar-b-q, Meats, Texas cooki
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     10 lb Beef brisket
 
  Recipe by: Chile Pepper Magazine - Sep/Oct 1990 Most barbecue in Texas
  revolves around beef, and more specifically, brisket. When you select
  your brisket, choose only "packer trimmed" briskets in the ten to
  twelve pound category. The smalller briskets don't have enought fat
  to tenderize them, and the larger ones could have come off of a tough
  old range bull that no amount of cooking will ever tenderize. Avoid
  closely trimmed or "value packed" brisket pieces. The fat that was
  cut off to make 'em pretty is the very stuff that would have made
  them tender! All briskets have a fat cover on one side. Ignore this!
  Squeeze the thick end with both thumbs. When you've found the brisket
  with the smallest fat kernel, that's the one for you. Take it home
  and build your fire. While your fire is getting going--I build mine
  out of a mixture of mesquite and oak--rub your brisket with a dry
  "rub." [See Red's Dry Rub recipe] Make sure that the meat is
  thoroughly coated. This helps seal the meat, and adds a flavorful
  crust.
  
  Thoroughly coat all surfaces of the brisket with lemon juice, and rub
  in well. Sprinkle dry rub generously all over the brisket, rubbing in
  well. Make sure that the brisket is entirely covered.
  
  When the wood has burned down, move the coals to one side of the pit,
  place the meat away from the direct heat, fat side up (let gravity
  and nature do the basting), and close the pit. Some people add a pan
  of water near the coals to provide added moisture, but I don't. Now,
  don't touch the meat for 12 hours. Just drink a few beers, cook a pot
  of beans, and tend your fire. You'd like to hold the cooking
  temperature around 210 degrees F. in the brisket cooking area. Since
  "helpers" usually show up at the first whiff of smoke, you probably
  ought to put some of your leftover rub on a couple of racks of pork
  ribs and toss them on the pit, in the hotter end, and baste and turn
  'em for four and five hours, just to keep the animals at bay.
  Meanwhile, see Red's Prize Winnin' Pintos recipe to keep you busy.
  
  Back at the pit, after the twelve hours are completed, generously
  slather the brisket with a basting sauce (not a barbecue sauce), wrap
  it tightly in aluminum foil, and return to the pit. [See Red's
  Basting Sauce recipe] Close off all of the air supplies to the fire,
  and allow the meat to "set" in the pit for three or four hours. This
  really tenderizes the meat. Serve your brisket with beans, cole slaw,
  Jalepenos, onions, pickles, and plenty of bread. Cold beer or iced
  tea are the traditional beverages of choice.
  
  You'll find that a ten-pound brisket will yield about 8-16 servings,
  depending on the individual brisket, and the size of the appetites of
  the guests.

      Title: RED'S BARBQ CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2    Whole chickens -- 4 lb or
           Larger *
      2    Lemon -- quartered
      2 md Onion -- quartered
      4    Sprigs fresh rosemary
      4    Cloves garlic -- halved
           Black pepper
           Vegetable oil
           Tabasco sauce
 
  Probably the most abused food on any barbeque pit is the poor old
  chicken. I don't know how many times good manners have been
  challenged by being served a blackened fowl that is still raw in the
  middle. There is no escape, so you pick around the edges, then beat a
  hasty retreat, hopefully, unobserved. Generally, there are two
  mistakes that lead to this travesty. First, the bird is cooked over a
  fire that is much too hot. If you remember that frying chicken takes
  about 45 minutes, and that the oil is ideally at 360 to 375 degrees
  F., then you begin to see that barbecuing, a less efficient cooking
  method, should take longer. And longer has to mean at a lower
  temperature level, or you wind up with the well-known charcoal
  effect. Secondly, many people feel that the clucker just has to be
  basted, and so they buy a bottle of comercial tomato-based sauce.
  Here comes the second layer of charring!! Just for grins, try out my
  method and see if the results aren't just a little more pleasing.
  
  Rinse the chickens thoroughly inside and out, discarding the neck and
  giblets. Stuff each chicken with one lemon, one onion, 2 sprigs of
  rosemary, and two cloves of garlic. Sprinkle each bird with black
  pepper. Place the birds in a covered barbecue pit, away from the
  direct heat and close the pit. Hold the temperature in the pit at
  about 250 degrees F. for 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours.
  
  Baste the birds occasionally with the cooking oil that has been
  seasoned to your liking with the Tabasco Sauce. When the chickens are
  a nice rich brown color, and the drumstick wiggles freely, they're
  done.
  
  *Whole chickens hold their juices better and come out much more moist.
  Larger birds have more fat and are better candidates for this method
  of cooking. If you're doing halved cluckers, then baste more
  frequently, and watch the cooking time. It should be about an hour
  less.

    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 lb Butter
      2    Onions -- peeled/thick
           Sliced

      4    Lemon -- quartered
    1/4 c  Worcestershire sauce
      2    Bay leaves
           Beer
 
  Melt the butter, add the onions and garlic, and saute for 4 to 5
  minutes to soften. Add the beer, squeeze in the lemon juice, and add
  the lemon rinds to the pot. When the foam subsides, add all of the
  remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a
  medium low and simmer for 20 minutes. Keep baste warm, adding beer
  and oil as needed.
  
  By the way, you'll notice that there are no tomatoes, ketchup, or
  sugar in this recipel. All of these things caramelize and burn
  quickly, giving the meat a nasty taste.

      Title: RED'S EASY ANTICUCHOS
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Canned jalapeno peppers  --
           Chopped
           Juice from 1 qt. can of
           Jalapenos  -- (escabeche)
      2 lb Sirloin steak  -- 1 1/2"
           Cubes
 
  Very few cities love a party more than San Antonio, Texas. A major
  part of San Antonio's annual Fiesta is a celebration called "Night in
  Old San Antonio", held in La Villita, the restored original little
  village of San Antonio. It's impossible to eat a sample of all of the
  foods sold, at least for the normal person, but one of the most
  popular is anticuchos--chunks of beef that have been marinated in a
  secret pepper marinade, skewered, and grilled over an open fire.
  Since nobody has offered a recipe, I made one up. Since you are going
  to hand a skewer full of meat to each guest, you really should hand
  them a cold beer for the other hand to preserve proper balance.
  
  Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive (not metal) dish and allow
  to marinate for one to two hours. Divide meat evenly between four
  skewers, and grill over very hot coals for 1-2 minutes per side (4-8
  minutes total cooking time_, basting with the remaining marinade at
  each turning. You may wish to cook the meat longer if you prefer it
  beyond medium rare. You can also reduce the size of the servings and
  use this recipe for hot hors d'oeuvres.

      Title: RED'S RIO GRANDE CATFISH
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Jalapeno peppers-stemmed
           And minced
      3    Serrano peppers  -- semmed
           And minced
    1/2 md Onion  -- diced
      2    Cloves garlic  -- pressed
      1 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Lime juice  -- freshly
           Squeezed
    1/2 tb Cumin powder
      2 tb Cilantro  -- minced
      4    8 oz catfish fillets
           -skinless
           & boneless
      1 c  Tomatoes  -- peel, dice,
           Chill
 
  In this part of the country, the table fish of choice is the
  catfish--at least it's the most common. You can usually order this
  fish prepared any way that you like it, as long as it's fried. Now,
  I've no complaints with a well-fried catfish, but there had to be
  another way.
  
  So a couple of nights ago, a few friends were over and we tried out
  this idea. Our "impartial" panel of judges decided that this was a
  definite keeper, and we are pleased to pass it on to you, literally,
  hot off the grill!
  
  Combine the first eight ingredients in a blender and coarsely blend.
  Place the filets in a non-reactive container large enough to hold
  them in a single layer. Pour the marinade over the filets and cover.
  Turn the filets once after thirty minutes. After a total marinating
  time of no more than one hour (any longer and they'll start to fall
  apart), grill them quickly over very hot mesquite coals, about 2-4
  minutes per side, basting with the marinade. Place each filet on a
  plate, and top with 1/4 cup of chilled chopped tomatoes.

      Title: RED'S SOUTH TEXAS FAJITAS
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4    Jalapeno peppers  --
           Pierced
      3 tb Chili powder
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
      1    8 oz bottle herb and garlic
           -oil-based salad dressing
      1 cn Beer  -- preferably Lone
           Star
  1 1/2 ts Garlic powder
      4 sm Mexican limes  -- juiced
      2 ts Cumin powder
      1 lg Onion  -- minced
      2 tb Cilantro  -- minced
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1    Bay leaf
      3 lb Skirt steak
 
  About twelve to fifteen years ago, fajitas were "discovered." since
  then, an awful lot of good meat has been wrecked, and skirt
  steak--once a "grinder" item--has risen sharply in price. Because
  skirt doesn't come from a "tender quadrant" of the carcass, some care
  is needed to turn it into good food. First, it needs to be marinated
  to tenderize and flavor it.
  
  Mix all the ingredients together, except the meat, to make a
  marinade. Pour over the skirt steak, in a non-reactive container (not
  metal), cover, and stir occasiionally for six to eight hours.
  
  Fajitas can be cooked in several ways. If you have the space, smoke
  the fajitas for 30 minutes with pure mesquite smoke, and then cook
  for 4-7 minutes per side over direct heat--mesquite coals being the
  heat of choice. Baste with the marinade throughout the cooking
  process. If you need to cook completely over direct heat, then use a
  fairly slow fire, about like you should use when grilling chicken,
  and cook, covered if possible, for about 10 - 15 minutes per side,
  basting with the marinade.
  
  Figure about a half pound of meat and 3 to 4 tortillas per person.
  When slicing fajitas, you'll notice that the grain of the skirt steak
  all runs the same way. If you'll slice the skirt at a forty-five
  degree angle to the grain, and hold your knife on a forty-five degree
  angle as well, you'll find that the fajitas are much more tender!
  Serve the fajitas with flour tortillas, pico de gallo salsa,
  guacamole, and cold beer. You'll notice that I didn't say anything
  about chicken fajitas--that's a contradiction in terms.

      Title: RED-COOKED POT ROAST (SHANGHAI POT ROAST)
 Categories: Chinese, Beef, Pork, Lamb
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      4 lb Chuck roast, boneless,
           -not too lean
      1 tb Sherry
    1/2 c  Regular soy sauce
      1 c  Water
      2 sl Ginger
      2 cl Garlic, optional
      1 oz Sugar
      2    Star anise stars
           -(optional for pork)
 
  Either brown the roast in a little fat or dunk it in boiling water
  for a minute or so [this step is optional]. Put it into a heavy
  kettle into which it fits fairly snugly. Add all the rest of the
  ingredients (ginger slices, star anise, and garlic should be at the
  bottom of the pot). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer
  covered, turning and basting occasionally, for 3 hours or until
  tender. Serve sliced, hot or cold. If cold, you may want to weight it
  down with a brick covered in foil or some similarly heavy item while
  chilling it in the fridge.
  
  You may cook lamb or pork this way, but cut the cooking time to 2 - 2
  1/2 hr. For lamb add a cinnamon stick instead of the star anise; for
  pork double the soy sauce and sherry, either halve or omit the stare
  anise, and use up to 4 oz of sugar to taste.

      1 ts Salt
 
  Modified from "Prairie Fire Reddened Rice", p.115 of _Coyote's
  Pantry_ by Mark Miller and Mark Kiffin.  The major differences are
  that I replaced the b*tt*r with water for the saute', I like to toast
  the rice, and 1/3 cup (even 3 Tbsp) of chile powder is way too
  mouth-blistering with the "New Mexico" chile powder I got at the
  local Mexican grocery. Total time: about 45 minutes; 30 minutes
  unattended
  
  In a large pan or skillet over low heat, saute' 2 cloves garlic and
  onion in a tablespoon or so of water, until soft and beginning to
  dry. Add rice and increase heat to medium-high; dry-toast until
  golden brown, stirring frequently.  Add water and all remaining
  ingredients, bring to a boil, and cook for two minutes.
  
  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until
  the water has just evaporated.  Remove from heat and let stand five
  minutes. Fluff up with a wooden spoon.

  Lafayette, LA. In Cajun land, this is pronounced Coo-bee-yon. NOTE-My
  mother-in-law used to add a touch of Creole mustard to her sauce. It
  gave it a good tangy flavor. Also she would put the filets in a
  baking dish, pour the sauce over and bake in the oven, so the fish
  would not fall apart. Contrary to what Chef Richard says, this dish is
  customarily served with mashed potatoes in my neck of the woods.

    1/4 c  Walnuts
  2 1/2 c  Sifted cake flour
      2 ts Cinnamon
      2 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2 ts Bakeing soda
      1 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs
      2 lg Egg whites
      2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Prune puree (see below)
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      2 c  Grated carrots (5-6 small)
      8 oz Crushed pineapple, (8 oz)
           - thoroughly drained
           Frosting (see below)

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
     12 oz Low-fat cream cheese,
           - softened
    1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
  1 1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat inside of three 9-inch round
  layer-cake pans with non-stick cooking spray. Line the bottoms with
  wax paper and set aside. Spread walnuts in a pie plate and bake for 8
  to 10 minutes at 350 degrees, or until fragrant.  Let cool; chop
  coarsely. Toasting the walnuts brings out their nutty flavor, and
  means you don't need to use as many as in traditional recipes. In a
  medium-sized bowl, stir together flour, cinnamon, baking powder,
  baking soda and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and egg
  whites. Add sugar, prune puree and oil and whisk until smooth.  Add
  the flour mixture to the egg mixture and stir with a wooden spoon
  until blended. Stir in carrots, pineapple and the toasted walnuts.
  Divide the batter among the prepared pans and bake for 30 to 35
  minutes at 350 degrees, or until a cake tester inserted in the center
  comes out clean. Let cool for 5 minutes in the pan on a rack. Loosen
  edges and invert cakes onto racks.  Peel off paper and let cool
  completely. TO MAKE PRUNE PUREE:  In a food processor, combine 6
  ounces (1 cup) pitted prunes with 6 tablespoons hot water; process
  until smooth. Makes 1 cup. One cup of prune puree contains 407
  calories and 1 gram of fat; a cup of butter contains 1,600 calories
  and 182 grams of fat; and a cup of oil contains 1,944 calories and
  218 grams of fat. FROSTING In a mixing bowl, combine cream cheese,
  sugar and vanilla; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and
  creamy. TO ASSEMBLE CAKE: Place 1 cake layer on a serving plate.
  Spread a scant 1/2 cup of frosting over it. Top with another cake
  layer and spread another scant 1/2 cup frosting.  Place third layer
  on top and spread with remaining frosting.  Serves 16. Calories: 310

      Title: REDUCED-SUGAR BLACKBERRY & CRABAPPLE JAM
 Categories: Jams, Fruits, Spread, Desserts
      Yield: 750 Ml
 
    500 g  Blackberries
    300 g  Crabapples
    200 ml Water
    350 g  Sugar
      2 tb Lemon juice
 
  NOTES: 1) The set of this spread is softer than conventional jam
  :       as it has less sugar.
  
       2) Also, it MUST be kept in the fridge - will keep for 1
  :       month. Will freeze also, but thawed jam must be used
  :       within 2 weeks.
  
       3) Try reducing the sugar further from 350g to 300g. Sterilize
  some jars - wash in hot soapy water and rinse well. Shake out as much
  water as you can, then dry in a 160 C (325 F, Gas 3) oven for at least
       10    minutes.
  
  Put a saucer in the fridge to chill.
  
  EITHER grate the crabapples, discarding the cores, OR cut out the
  cores and chop the apples finely in a processor. Put the berries,
  apples and water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil then simmer 5
  minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the sugar and lemon juice. Stir
  until sugar is dissolved then increase heat and boil rapidly for 7
  minutes. Remove from heat and test for set: put a teaspoonful onto
  the chilled saucer and chill again for at least 2 minutes until cold.
  This is what the jam will be like when it has cooled. If it is too
  runny, clean off the saucer (so you don't get mixed up!), put it back
  into the fridge and boil the jam for another minute or so. Test
  again.  When happy with set, ladle into hot sterilized jars and put
  on lids.

  electric mixer beat cream cheese until it is light and fluffy. Add
  the sugar gradually, beating, and beat until the mixture is combined
  well. Beat in the flour, add the eggs, 1 at a time and beating after
  each addition, and beat in the sour cream, the zests, salt and
  vanilla, beating the filling until it is combined well.
  
  Pour the filling into the crust and bake the cheesecake in a foil
  lined shallow baking pan in the middle of the oven for 1 hour and 10
  minutes. The cake will not be completely set; it will set as it
  cools. Turn the oven off and let the cake stand in the oven with the
  oven door propped open about 6 inches until it is cooled completely.
  Chill the cheesecake, covered, overnight.
  
  Remove the sides of the pan.  Arrange the raspberries in a star shape
  on the top of the cake, and arrange the blueberries around them to
  cover the rest of the cake.

           -into 1/2-inch slices
  1 1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese,
           -cut into 1/4-inch slices
      1 lg White onion, cut into
           -thin slices (optional)
 
  Cut the eggplant lengthwise once, then slice crosswise into semi-disks
  about 3/4 inch thick.
  
  In a shallow casserole dish (about 2 in deep), stand some slices of
  eggplant on the narrow cut edge, to make a row, then follow this with
  slices of tomato, then slices of mozzarella cheese. Repeat until the
  whole dish is full.  It should appear from the top to have bands of
  red, white and black.
  
  Use your favorite seasoning (basil/oregano is the default), and bake
  until bubbly (about 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Eggplant casserole with tomato and cheese -- From "Victory Garden
  Cookbook" maybe? Anyway, that's an excellent source for ideas...
  
  *  You may wish to put a layer of onions on the bottom, horizontally,
  before you put the eggplant in the pan.
  
  *  This only works with European-style eggplant; Japanese and Asian
  eggplants are too narrow.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  Several people have asked questions about nutrition, pregnancy
  requirements, amino acids, and so on. For vegans, I would like to
  recommend these resources:
  
  Akers, Keith. A Vegetarian Sourcebook. Denver: Vegetarian Press, 1989.
  Nutrient density charts show how easy it is to get more than enough
  protein, iron, calcium, and other nutrients from plant foods alone.
  
  Thrash, Agatha Moody, M.D. Nutrition for Vegetarians. Seale, Ala.: New
  Lifestyle Books, 1982. Includes information about vegan nutrition
  during pregnancy and childhood. Order by calling (205) 855-4708.
  
  Klaper, Michael, M.D. Vegan Nutrition: Pure and Simple. Paia, Ha.:
  Gentle World, 1992. Discusses problems associated with animal
  products.
  
  For detailed nutrient information, I refer to the tables in this
  manual:
  
  Pennington, Jean. Food Values of Portions Commonly Used. 15th ed. New
  York: Harper Collins, 1989. Tables provide values of major nutrients
  in common foods. Appendix includes amino acid analyses.

      2 tb Sugar
  2 1/4 c  Hot Water (130 degrees F.)
      2 pk Active Dry Yeast
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 c  Butter or Margarine **
 
  *     Use up to this much flour.  Use only enough flour to make a soft

  must be at room temperature or use the same amount of vegetable oil.
  In a large bowl mix 2 cups of the flour, the yeast, sugar, and salt.
  Stir in the hot water and when mixed, beat with an electric mixer at
  medium medium speed or with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes, scraping
  sides of bowl occasionally.
  
  Add butter and 1 cup more of the flour; when mixed, beat at medium
  speed or by hand for 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. With
  wooden spoon, gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
  a soft dough.
  
  Turn dough out on lightly floured surface (use some of the remaining
  flour) and knead for 8 to 10 minutes until dough is smooth and
  elastic, adding only enough flour to keep dough from sticking.
  
  Cover dough with bowl and let stand 20 minutes.
  
  In the meantime grease two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch loaf pans or a
  large baking sheet.
  
  Uncover dough and knead briefly; divide in half and place in pans or
  on baking sheet.  Brush 2 sheets of plastic wrap with oil and cover
  loaves loosely.

  Ingredients:
  
  1.5 kg  potatoes (a sort that stays "hard" - not the one you use for
  mashed potatoes) 1 big onion 2 eggs 1 tsp salt a bit flour
  (Buchweizen (wheat flour or oat flakes) Oil Grate the potatoes over a
  sieve, so that the water can leave.  Don't use a to fine grater, you
  don't want to make mashed potatoes.
  
  Squeeze the potatoes - so that more water is going out of it.
  
  Grate the onions fine on the grater and put them to the potatoes,
  like the other ingredients and mix them carefully.
  
  Depending on how wet the dough is, put some flour or oat flakes to
  it, so that you get a not to solid dough.
  
  Put oil into a pan and when it is really hot, take with a (soap)
  spoon abit from the dough and put it into the pan and push it to a
  flat cake.
  
  They have to be "golden" from both sides (you have to turm them after
  awhile) - the border of that pancake has to be real crisp.
  
  Eat them hot to (or on) a slice of bread (Schwarzbrot (that is dark
  bread)) with butter and put Ruebenkraut (sugar-root syrup) or
  Apfelkraut (apple syrup) on it.

  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  *For the nicest looking shiny glaze, serve this cake on the day it is
  completed.  The cake remains moist and delicious, however, for several
  days.
  
  PREPARATION: Heat oven to 325F. Butter and flour an 8-inch square or
  10-inch round cake pan. Cut the 4 ounces of chocolate into small
  pieces and melt in the top of a double boiler set over hot water,
  stirring frequently. Remove pan from hot water and cool slightly. In
  a food processor, nut grinder or blender, grind the 4 ounces of
  almonds to a powder. If you use a processor or blender, put 2
  tablespoons of the sugar in the machine along with the nuts.  Put
  ground nuts through a sieve to get rid of any remaining chunks. Toss
  the powdered almond mixture with the flour. Separate the eggs. Beat
  together the butter and 1/3 cup of the remaining sugar until creamy
  and light. Add the melted chocolate and the extract. Add the egg
  yolks, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Beat
  the whites to stiff peaks, add the remaining sugar, and beat until
  glossy. Fold in nut mixture. Gently followed egg white mixture into
  chocolate just until incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared
  pan. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the
  center of the cake comes out almost clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in
  the pan for about 10 minutes. Divide into individual servings if
  desired. Recipe can be made to this point up to a day ahead.
  
  CHOCOLATE GLAZE: Heat the chocolate and butter in the top of a double
  boiler set over hot water, stirring frequently, until just melted.
  Remove from hot water. Cool the chocolate glaze just until it
  thickens. It should remain pourable. Glaze whole cake or individual
  servings on a rack set over a pan to catch drippings. Garnish with
  almonds if desired.
  
  Serve at room temperature or refrigerate for up to 4 days.
  
  Serves 6.

      Title: REMPAH (MALAY CURRY)
 Categories: Indian, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12 oz Sweet Potato -- (red) *
     12 oz White Yam -- peeled & cubed
      1    In
      1 lg Onion -- peeled and diced
      6    Garlic Cloves
      1    To 6 Green Chillies -- (to
           -taste)
      1    Red  Capsicum Pepper-seeded
      2    Inch Cube Fresh Ginger
      6 tb Vegetable Oil -- or ghee
      3 oz To 4 Oz. Milk
  3 1/2 oz Creamed Coconut
      3 tb Dessicated Coconut
      2 tb Tamarind Puree -- (or
           Tamarind sauce)
           -----Spices-----
      1 ts Coriander Seed -- ground
    1/2 ts Ground Cumin
    1/2 ts Chinese Five-Spice Powder
    1/2 ts Garlic Powder
    1/4 ts Lemon Grass Powder
      1 ts Paprika
    1/4 ts Chilli Powder
    1/2 ts Turmeric
      1 ts Coconut Powder
 
  * peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes
  
  Add enough water to the spices to make a stiffish paste, then leave to
  stand for a few minutes.
  
  Make a puree of the onion, garlic, chillies, red pepper and ginger.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the spice paste for 5 minutes or so; stir to
  prevent sticking. Then add the puree and fry for 15 minutes. WARNING:
  The puree will sputter and splash quite a lot during this stage! Just
  grit your teeth and keep going!
  
  Combine the cubed yam and sweet potato with the above in a casserole
  and place in an oven preheated to 375F/190C. Cook for about 1 hour.
  
  Meanwhile, heat the milk and melt the block of creamed coconut.
  
  Brown the dessicated coconut under the grill.
  
  Halfway through the cooking of the casserole, add the two coconuts
  and the tamarind puree to the dish. Stir, and add some water (or
  vegetable stock) if it needs it ~ the finished curry should have a
  thick, rich sauce.
  
  Serves 4.
  
  NOTES:
  
  This is the curry I made for a dinner party on Good Friday. I used
  yams and sweet potatoes, but in the past I've used a mixture of
  broccolli and cauliflower with equally good results. Before becoming
  vegetarian, I used to use cubed lean lamb or beef. Whichever main
  ingredient is used, it's long been my favourite home-made curry!

  together flour, lemon peel, baking powder, and salt. Set flour
  mixture aside. 2. Melt the 3 oz. white baking bar with 1/4 cup of the
  half and half, milk or light cream in a small heavy saucepan over
  very low heat, stir- ring constantly till baking bar starts to melt.
  Immediately remove from heat and stir till baking bar is completely
  melted smooth. Stir in remaining half and half, milk or cream; cool.
  3. In a large mixing bowl, beat the margarine or butter with an elec-
  tric mixer on medium to high speed about 30 seconds, or until soft.
  Add sugar and vanilla; beat till combined. Add the egg yolks, one at
  a time, beating till combined. Alternately add the flour mixture and
  the white baking bar mixture, beating on low to medium speed after
  each addition just till combined. 4. Wash beaters. In a medium mixing
  bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on high speed till
  stiff peaks form. Gently fold in the egg whites into the batter.
  Spread batter into 2 greased and light- ly floured 8 x 1 1/2 inch
  round baking pans. 5. Bake in a 350F oven for 25-30 minutes or till a

  from the berries and drizzle liqueur over the cake layer on the
  plate. Stir jam again to soften, and spread over the cake layer. Top
  with 1/3 of the White chocolate frosting. Spoon the 1 cup of berries
  on top of the frosting. 3. Top the berries with the remaining cake
  layer. Frost top and sides with remaining frosting. Gently place the
  White chocolate curls on the frosting on the top of the cake in any
  manner which you would like. Carefully cover the cake loosely with
  plastic wrap and chill for up to 24 hours. Just before serving,
  sprinkle cake with 1/2 cup berries and sift powdered sugar lightly
  over cake.
  
  For the Frosting: 1. Chill a medium mixing bowl and the beaters of an
  electric mixer. 2. Place the white baking bar and 1/4 cup of the
  whipping cream in a small heavy saucepan over very low heat, stirring
  constantly till the baking bar starts to melt. Immediately remove
  from the heat and stir until smooth. Cool completely. 3. In a 1 cup
  glass measure combine the cold water and unflavored gelatin. Let
  stand 2 minutes. Place cup in saucepan of boiling water. Heat and
  stir till gelatin is completely dissolved. 4. In the chilled mixing
  bowl, beat the remaining 1 1/4 cups of whipping cream and sugar with
  the chilled beaters on medium speed while gradually drizzling gelatin
  over whipping cream mixture. Beat till soft peaks start to form.
  Continue beating, gradually adding cooled baking bar mixture until
  stiff peaks form. Do not overbeat. Use immediately to frost cake.

  medium curry base with Spices 2 at stage 6. 1. Skin the chicken, on
  or off the bone or cut any fat off the meat. 2. Heat the oil and fry
  the onion puree until it is very hot. Don't let it stick. 3.
  Meanwhile, add a little water to Spices 1 to make a paste and preheat
  the oven to 375 F. 4. Add the spice paste to the hot onion puree, and
  stir continuously. reduce the heat if it starts to stick. Cook for
  5-8 minutes until the spices are cooked and the water content
  removed. When the oil floats to the top it is done. 5. Put the
  meat/chicken and onion and tomato purees into a casserole dish, stir
  and put into the oven. cook for 45 minutes. 6. Stir and add Spices 2

           Sliced into fine disks
      2 tb Minced cilantro
 
  Boil each type of seafood in salted water separately, until tender:
  
  Octopus: You may have to purchase a whole octopus. A large one (more
  than l pound) may require up to 2 hours; a smaller one may take only
  l 1/2 hours. Cut the thick portions of cooked octopus meat into
  1/2-inch rings, but leave the slender tips of the ten
  
  Shrimp The shrimp are done when they turn pink about 3 to 4 minutes.
  After cooking, cool and peel.
  
  Crab meat Fresh crabmeat requires about 3 minutes of cooking. Cool and
  remove meat from the shells.
  
  Squid: Cut the squid into 1/4-inch rings, removing the hard core from
  the head and separating the tentacles into 3 or 4 bunches. Boil only
  for about l0 minutes; overcooking will toughen meat.
  
  Prepare the sauce. Toss the prepared seafood with the vegetables and
  cilantro. Serve in old-fashioned ice-cream sundae glasses or in fluted
  goblets. If desired, you may garnish with slices of avocado. Makes
        4    servings.
  
  Cocktail Sauce: Mix together 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup fresh lime
  juice, 1/4 cup water and salt to taste.

  sugar, beating on medium speed, then add the eggs, one at a time,
  beating thoroughly after each addition, without rushing. Meanwhile,
  sift the flour, semolina, baking powder, and almonds together.  Very
  gradually add to the batter, beating on medium speed, then pour in
  the vanilla and brandy and give the batter a last whirl on high speed
  for a few seconds. Pour immediately into a buttered 9 x 12 x 3-inch
  cake pan and bake on the center rack of a moderate oven (350 F) for
  30 to 35 minutes, or until the cake springs back when touched by a
  finger. Remove from the oven and set the pan on a cake rack. Using a
  sharp knife, score the cake into diamond shapes. Spoon the cooled
  syrup over the entire cake and cool. Note: Each piece may be
  attractively garnished with a candied or marachino cherry slice in
  the center and almond slivers angled on each side.

      Title: REVIEW OF COUNTRY LIFE BRUNCH (BOSTON)
 Categories: Text, Restaurant, Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Text file
 
  Last Sunday my 4yo and I had brunch at Country Life in Boston. It
  seemed a little disorganized (I couldn't figure out the logistics at
  first) but the food was pretty good. I asked about fat content and
  was given a fairly thorough oil content summary.  The person with
  whom I spoke claimed they are very conscious of using as little oil
  as possible, waffles & french toast have no oil and 1tsp of oil total
  used for their (rather good) strawberry rhubarb tart crust.  They
  also had other baked goods which he said was low fat (I didn't press
  for details since I had enough other things to eat), a hot apple
  cobbler (w/no added oil topping), a delicious frozen fruit drink,
  steamed brocolli, plain rice, eggplant/tofu lasagna (not too heavy on
  the tofu), a curry(?) tofu dish (not lowfat unfortunately), a small
  salad bar (w/a delicious NF garlic & red cabbage dressing), two
  soups, etc. etc.
   My 4yo ate tons of fresh fruit cocktail. For one adult & one child,
  it was $12.  (If you want real coffee you have to bring your own,
  which I saw others doing).
  
  I forgot to ask about soy milk use though, so perhaps next person to
  go can ask about that?
  
  BTW Does anyone have suggestions for a REALLY NICE brunch place? My
  husband is planning on taking me out for Mother's Day to the Harbour
  Hotel, which has a great buffet but seems very $$$ for the amount of
  food I can eat there :-( I wasn't sure how he would take my
  suggestion of going someplace else but he was surprisingly amenable
  (he even said how about a vegetarian place !!!), but I don't think he
  really wants to eat scrambled tofu and we also want to go someplace a
  bit dress-up. I've been calling places but so far I haven't come up
  with anything clearly better. Has anyone been to Cornucopia?  They
  suggested on the phone fruit platters & salads, which makes me a bit
  wary :-(

    3/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Boiling Water
    1/4 c  Bacon Fat
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  Combine the cornmeal, salt and sugar in a heatproof bowl. Stir in the
  boiling water,  1/4  cup at a time, until the mixture is thick and
  pasty. Let stand until it "swells" (1-2 minutes). Heat the bacon fat
  in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Stir enough milk into
  the cornmeal mixture to form a batter which looks like slightly
  mashed potatoes (it should spread only slightly when dropped from a
  spoon). Drop the batter by heaping serving spoon fulls (about 2
  Tablespoons each) into the hot fat, pulling in the edges of the cakes
  with a metal spatula to prevent spreading. The cakes should be about
  1/4 " thick. Cook the cakes until they are brown and crusty (about 6
  minutes per side). Drain the cakes on paper towels. Split each cake
  and serve hot.

      Title: RHODE ISLAND RED CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups, Clams
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     16 lg Qauhogs (2 cups chopped
           -meat)
      2 c  Dry white wine
      2    To 3 cups bottled clam broth
           -(or fish stock)
    1/4 lb Salt pork
      1 lg Onion
      2    Stalks celery
      2    Cloves garlic
      1 bn Flat leaf (Italian) parsley
      2    Bay leaves
      2    Sprigs fresh thyme
      4    Ripe tomatoes
      1 tb Tomato puree
      2 lg Potatoes
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Cayenne pepper
 
  Here is how Boston chef William Poirer makes red chowder, and it is
  good enough to convert the most diehard white chowder fanatic.
  
  Scrub the qauhogs and place them in a large, covered pot with the
  wine. Steam them for 10 to 15 minutes or until the shells just open.
  Shuck the quahogs and grind, using a meat grinder or food processor.
  Strain the cooking liquid through damp cheesecloth - you should have
  6 cups. If necessary, add clam broth or fish stock to make up the
  difference.
  
  Finely dice the salt pork.  Fry the salt pork slowly in a large pot
  over low heat to render the fat. Transfer the cracklings with a
  slotted spoon to a paper towel to drain. Meanwhile, finely chop the
  onion and celery. Mince the garlic.  Tie half of the parsley and the
  other herbs into a bouquet garni. Finely chop the remaining parsley.
  Peel, seed and coarsely chop the tomatoes.  Peel and dice the
  potatoes into a bowl of cold water to prevent them from browning.
  
  Saute the onions, celery, garlic and bouquet garni in the rendered
  fat over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft but not
  browned. Add the tomatoes and tomato paste, increase the heat to
  high, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the 6 cups of clam liquid and bring
  to a boil. Add the potatoes, reduce the heat, and simmer for 8 to 10
  minutes, or until tender.
  
  Just before serving, stir in the quahog meat and salt and pepper to
  taste. Garnish the chowder with the chopped parsley and the salt pork
  cracklings and serve at once.
  
  Serves 8.

 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Green or red pepper, seeded
           And chopped
      1    Onion (I used red) chopped
      1    To 4 Garlic Cloves minced
      1    Jalapeno pepper (optional)
      2 cn Black beans, drained
      1 cn Corn kernals (the vacuum
           Packed type), drained
      1 cn Tomato paste (the small
           Kind)
      1    To 2 Tablespoons soy sauce
        x  Cumin, Thyme, Cayenne pepper
           (to taste, I used about
      1 ts Each.
 
  Saute vegetables in balsamic vinegar with the spices until soft and
  onion is clear.  Add rest of the ingredients, stir up and cook till
  warm. (I used a 12 in. nonstick skillet and it was full to the top!)
  Should be thick, not liquid.
  
  Spoon into ff flour tortillas , roll up, and bake for 10-15 minutes.
  
  I had some steamed kale left over and rolled it up with the filling
  interesting addition, I liked it!  I also added some ff soyakass
  jalepeno "cheese"
  
  Warning!  This makes a lot!  I ate 2 each evening for 5 days, and
  still had filling left over to freeze.  It freezes well. Also, when
  cold, I just microwaved for 2-3 minutes (with a damp paper towel to
  keep the tortillas from getting tough), and that worked fine, too. I
  did not use a jalepeno in my version, just personal taste. Obviously,
  I liked them a lot to eat so many days in a row, but they were easy
  to fix! Hope you all like 'em. Yum!--

           -Source: Cuisine July'94
 
  Nostalgia reigns with this satisfying dessert pie. The wonderfully
  crunchy crust makes a great combination with the smooth slightly tart
  filling. Preparation time: 20 minutes.  Cooking time: 1 hour plus 1
  hour standing for pastry.
  
  Crumbly Pastry 2 cups plain flour 1/4 cup sugar pinch of salt 125g
  unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 eggs, lightly beaten with a
  fork
  
  Filling 500g rhubarb, trimmed and roughly chopped 1/4 cup water 1/2
  cup sugar 2 teaspoons lemon zest 250g raspberries (fresh or frozen
  but if using frozen raspberries drain excess juice) 2 teaspoons
  cornflour To serve: icing sugar to dust
  
  To prepare the pastry, combine flour, sugar and salt in a mixing bowl
  or blender.  Make a well in centre of dry ingredients and add butter
  and eggs. Using a fork, rapidly combine ingredients, or blend for
  about 30 seconds to combine.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface and
  knead briefly. Gather pastry into a ball, wrap in plastic food wrap
  and refrigerate for 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: place
  rhubarb, water and sugar in a saucepan and cook over a medium heat
  for 6-8 minutes, until rhubarb is tender.  Cool slightly, then gently
  fold in lemon zest, raspberries and cornflour mixed with a little
  water.  Divide dough into 2 pieces, one slightly bigger than the
  other. Chill the smaller ball. On a well floured board, roll larger
  ball to fit a 24cm round pie dish to a thickness of about 3mm.  Line
  pie dish with pastry. Spoon fill- ing over pastry base. Grate chilled
  pastry over top of filling. Bake at l80C for 50-60 minutes until

  Raspberries and rhubarb in one tart means that one of the fruits must
  be frozen if locally produced products are to be used. Happily, this
  dish works well with either fresh or frozen berries or rhubarb. The

      1 c  Sugar, brown, light
      1    Egg
      1 c  Cooked rhubarb, drained **
      2 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Nutmeg, grated
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
      3 tb Crystallized ginger; finely
           -chopped (opt)
    1/2 c  Walnuts; chopped
      1 c  Raisins
 
  ** To cook rhubarb:  Use a proportion of 4 cups sliced rhubarb cut in
  1/2-inch pieces to 1 cup sugar.  Toss the rhubarb and sugar together
  and let steep overnight (you will be amazed at how much juice the
  rhubarb gives off).  Pour off 3/4 cup of the liquid and use for a
  drink. Cook the rhubarb slices in the remaining until just tender but
  still holding their shape, less than 5 minutes. The rhubarb is ready
  to eat as is, to use in other recipes, or to freeze in containers.
  
  Cream the butter and sugar together.  Add the egg and beat until
  light, then stir in the rhubarb.  Stir the flour, salt, baking soda,
  and spices together and toss until thoroughly mixed. Stir the dry
  ingredients into the rhubarb mixture until the two are blended, then
  fold in the optional ginger, the walnuts, and the raisins. Drop the
  batter by the tablespoonful onto greased baking sheets about 1 1/2
  inches apart, and bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 12 minutes,
  until lightly browned at the edges.

      Title: RHUBARB CREAM PIE (MONTEITH)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Pastry for a single crust
           -9 in pie
  2 1/2 c  Rhubarb cut in 1/2 inch
           -pieces
      3 lg Eggs, separated
    1/2 c  Half and half or milk
      1 c  Sugar, separated
      2 tb All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
  Fit pastry into 9 inch pie pan.  Put rhubarb in pastry lined pan.
  
  In a bowl beat egg yolks, cream, 2/3 cup sugar, and flour until
  smooth. Pour mixture over rhubarb.  Bake in a 375 oven on lowest rack
  until pastry is golden brown and custard appears set in the middle
  when the pie is jiggled, about 40 to 45 minutes.  You may meed to
  cover the edges of the pastry to prevent over browning.
  
  In a large bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar at high speed
  with an electric mixer.  When frothy gradually whip in the remaining
  sugar and vanilla, beating until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks (be
  careful not to over beat).  Pile meringue onto hot filling. With a
  spatula, swirl meringue over filling and up against pastry rim. Bake
  in a 400 oven until meringue is tinged brown, 3 to 5 minutes.  (note
  if you are woried about saftey you must continue past this until the
  center of the meringue is 160 degrees, about 7 minutes).
  
  Serve warm or at room temperature.  If made ahead, let cool, then
  cover without touching meringue and chill up until the next day.
  Unfortunately, this pie does not hold well and is best served the day
  it is made.

      Title: RHUBARB CRUMBLE-CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Fruits
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     14 oz Rhubarb, trimmed weight
     10 oz Self-raising flour
      7 oz Butter
      4 oz Caster sugar
      3 oz Pale muscovado sugar
      1    Orange
  1 1/2 oz Chopped hazelnut kernels
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 lg Eggs
 
  First make the nutty crumble topping.  Sift 4 oz flour into a bowl,
  and add 3 oz butter.  Do not rub in the fat but cut it in with a
  pastry blender or a pair of knives used like scissors. Stir in the
  muscovado sugar and nuts and set aside.
  
  Sift the remaining 6 oz flour and the cinnamon into a separate bowl
  and reserve.  Slice the rhubarb into 1-inch chunks and finely grate
  the zest of the orange over it. Cream the remaining 1/4 lb butter
  with the caster sugar until pale, creamy and light.  Break up the
  eggs with a fork and add them to the butter mixture a little at a
  time, alternating with spoonfuls of the flour and cinnamon and add 2
  tablespoons of orange juice.
  
  Spoon the cake mixture evenly over the base of a 9-inch spring-clip
  tin that has been greased, lined and greased again. Scatter the
  rhubarb and orange mixture evenly over the top then cover the fruit
  with the nutty crumble mixture.  Bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for
  about 1 1/4 hours.
  
  Leave in a warm draught-free place to cool down slowly after baking
  and wait until the crumble-cake is completely cold before taking it
  out of the tin.  Wait until the next day before eating.

      Title: RHUBARB FOOL
 Categories: Desserts, Low fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Fresh rhubarb
           Juice and rind of one
           Orange
           Sugar to taste
      1    Sachet gelatine
           Cream substitute of some
           Sort: yogurt, fromage frais,
           Evaporated milk,
           Whatever
 
  Stew the rhubarb with the orange rind/juice, sugar, and as little
  water as you can get away with.  Melt in the gelatine (if you are
  vegetarian or vegan, use another gelling agent), and then put through
  food processor to make puree.  Add the cream substitute - I would use
  fromage frais, but yogurt is fine, or you might like whisked
  evaporated milk, if you like the taste.  Then refrigerate until set.
  
  If, like me, the mere thought of rhubarb sets your teeth on edge
  (it's one of the very few things I really can't eat!), then use a
  different fruit - gooseberries, perhaps, or dried apricots.
  Gooseberries are nicest if stewed with elderflowers, if you can get
  them, and dried apricots don't need any help. I've not quoted
  quantities for the sugar, because it depends on your taste.

      Title: RHUBARB LEMON TOFU "PIE" (VLF VEGAN)
 Categories: Vegetables, Sept., Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5    Stalks rhubarb, washed,
           Leaves discarded
      1    Granny smith apple, peeled,
           Cored and cubed
           Dozen large strawberries
      6 oz Firm (reduced fat) tofu
           Juice of 1/2 lemon
    1/4 c  + 2 T sugar
      2 tb Whole wheat flour
      2 ts Sugar + 2 t whole wheat
           Flour (or optional pie crust
           And crust crumble)
 
  In a rice cooker, (or pot) add a little water and the rhubarb stalks,
  chopped.  Cook covered for several minutes (be more observant if doing
  rangetop cooking, as heat source may be hotter, and add water as
  needed). When rhubarb is pretty well done, carefully remove the cover
  (have an oven mitt on) and add the cubed apple, strawberries, and 1/4
  c sugar. Cover and continue cooking a few more minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, puree the tofu in a food processor or chopper, until very
  smooth.  Add lemon juice, 2 T sugar, 2 T whole wheat flour, and
  process until well blended. Line an 8" pie tin with oil, (here you
  can add a pie shell if you prefer, instead of...) and sprinkle to
  coat with a sugar and whole wheat flour mixture, about 2 t each.
  Spread the tofu mixture into the pie tin (or onto the crust).  Bake
  at 400 F for a few minutes, (until crust is done, if using a crust).
  Remove and cool.
  
  Check rhubarb mixture for sweetness (I use a minimum of sugar), and
  adjust to your preference.  Pour into a fine (or cheesecloth lined)
  seive, and drain off juices, do not squeese dry. Save juices for some
  other use (perhaps for a jelly).  Pour remaining rhubarb mixture over
  the baked lemon tofu. Refrigerate (or top with crust crumble and bake
  again until done). The texture of the fruit mixture does not jell, or
  thicken, when the smaller amount of sugar is used, but I like it the
  way it is. The lemon tofu is in sweet contrast to the more tart but
  still sweet rhubarb and fruit filling.

      3 c  Diced rhubarb
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
      1 pk Unflavored gelatin
    1/4 c  Tanqueray or other juniper-
           -flavored gin, such as
           -Gilbey's or Beefeater
      2 c  Cream

  (From "Pacific Northwest Palate," by Susan Bradley.)
  
  Sprinkle the brown sugar over the rhubarb and let sit for an hour.
  Put in a saucepan, cover, and simmer gently for 15 minutes or so,
  until fully tender and quite thick. Puree in a processor.
  
  Soften the gelatin in the gin for 10 minutes. Combine with the
  rhubarb and heat to dissolve the gelatin. Set into an ice-water bath
  (a large bowl filled halfway with ice and a couple of cups of water.)
  Cool until cold to the touch, but do not allow the gelatin to set.
  
  With an electric mixer, combine the cream and rhubarb mixture. Whip
  until fluffy and light. Do not overwhip or the cream will break down.
  
  Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the sugar and continue
  until stiff peaks have formed. Carefully fold the egg whites into the
  rhubarb and cream mixture. Turn the mousse into a clear glass, 6-cup,
  straight-sided souffle dish or into individual 1-cup souffle dishes
  and refrigerate for 2 hours or more.
  
  To make the Strawberry Gin Sauce, puree the strawberries and sugar
  together in a processor. Strain through a sieve and reserve. Warm the
  marmalade just to melt. Combine the marmalade, the gin, and the
  pureed strawberries, mixing well. Chill thoroughly.
  
  Serve each portion of mousse topped or surrounded with sauce; pass the
  sauce separately.

      Title: RHUBARB SORBET
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Rhubarb (trimmed weight)
      4 tb Honey
      1    Orange (zest only)
      2    Egg whites
 
  Prepare and cook the rhubarb at least a day ahead of serving the
  sorbet. Wipe and trim the fruit, then slice it quite thinly into a
  flameproof casserole. Sprinke the finely grated orange zest over it
  and drizzle on 2 tablespoons of the honey.  Cover and leave in a cool
  place for 2 hours or more until the sweetener has drawn out some of
  the rhubarb juices; this liquid will prevent sticking during cooking.
  
      Cook the rhubarb in the covered dish until perfectly tender - I
  think this is best done in a low oven but you can use a very gentle
  flame on top of the stove if you prefer. Let the cooked rhubarb cool
  slightly, then add the remaining 2 tablespoons honey and whizz to a
  very smooth puree in a food-processor.
  
      When the puree is quite cold, freeze it in a chilled loaf tin, or
  other suitable container, until firm round the edges. Beat the
  half-frozen sorbet until slushly.  Whisk the egg whites and fold them
  in so the mixture looks like a pale pink snow.  Cover and freeze
  until solid. Beat to break up ice crystals and to increase bulk, then
  freeze the sorbet again until you are ready to serve it.  Shortbread
  fingers make a good crunchy accompaniment.

      Title: RHUBARB~ ROSE~ & STRAWBERRY JAM
 Categories: Jams
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Rhubarb, trimmed weight
      1 lb Small strawberries
           -- slightly underripe
    1/2 lb Highly scented rose petals
  1 1/2 lb Sugar
      4 sm Juicy lemons
 
  Rhubarb is an unreliable setter so the inclusion of lemon juice in
  this recipe is essential and I like to play it safe by cooking the
  lemon pips with the fruit in order to extract their pectin. Slice the
  rhubarb and layer it in a large bowl with the whole hulled
  strawberries and the sugar. Pour on the lemon juice, cover and leave
  overnight.
  
  Tip the contents of the bowl into a preserving pan. Add the lemon
  pips tied in a muslin bag and bring gently to a boil. Boil for 2
  minutes then tip the contents of the pan back into the bowl.  Cover
  and leave in a cool place over night once more.
  
  Put the rhubarb and strawberry mixture back into the pan. Pinch out
  the white tips from the bases of the rose petals and add the petals
  to the pan, pushing them well down among the fruit. Bring to the boil
  and fast boil until setting point is reached, then pot in warm
  sterilised jars in the usual way. Makes enough to fill 6 or 7 jars.

      Title: RIBBE
 Categories: Main dish, Pork, Norwegian, Christmas
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      3 kg Pork ribs
           Salt
           Pepper
  2 1/2 dl Water
 
  The steak should be without the pork chop part. If you prefer to use a
  loin, extend the time in the oven to 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Break the ribs
  every 5 centimeters. Make a checkerboard pattern on the skin side
  with a sharp knife. 1-2 days before the steak goes in the oven rub it
  with salt and pepper and lay it with the skin-side down. Heat the
  oven to 230 C. Put the steak in with the skin-side down. Put some
  water in the tray with it. Cover the steak. Let it be for 20 minutes.
  Take away the cowering, turn the steak, reduce temperature to 175 C.
  Place it high in the oven. Ready after 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Be sure that
  the skin does not get black, it should just be slightly crispy. Cut
  into pieces; between the ribs and where you broke the bones. When
  served warm it should be accompanied by surkaal, sweet mustard and
  hot fat. Is also served cold. Either in pieces or sliced to go on a
  loaf of bread. Norwegians still prefer it with sweet mustard.

      Title: RICCOTA
 Categories: Italian, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 qt Milk
      3 tb Distilled white vinegar OR
    1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
           Salt (if desired)
 
  Pour the milk into a heavy stainless-steel or enameled saucepan and
  stir in the white vinegar or lemon juice.
  
  Set the pot over very low heat and bring the milk very slowly to a
  simmer (a reading of 200 degrees on a thermometer). There will be
  fine beads around the edge of the milk, which will look foamy but
  will not appear to be boiling.
  
  Remove the pot from the heat and set it, covered, in a spot where it
  can remain undisturbed and where the temperature will remain fairly
  uniform at a reading between 80 and 100 degrees. (An unheated oven,
  without a pilot light, is a good spot.)  Let the milk stand for about
  6 hours, or until a solik curd floats above the liquid (the whey).
  More or less time may be required, depending on the temperature of
  the environment and the characteristics of the milk.
  
  Line a fine sieve with doubled, dampened cheesecloth (or, better yet,
  two layers of very fine-mesh nylon curtain netting, dampened) and set
  it over a bowl. Dip the curds and whey into the sieve and allow the
  whey to drain off until the ricotta is yogurtlike.  If you want
  firmer cheese, tie the corners of the cloth to form a bag and hang it
  up to drain further. (In warm weather, the draining might well be
  completed in the refrigerator.)
  
  When the texture of the ricotta is to your liking, add a little salt
  (from 1/4 to 1/2 t) if you wish.  Store the cheese, covered, in the
  refrigerator. It will be at its best after it has chilled for 24
  hours, and will keep well for 4 or 5 days.
  
  Author's notes:  Unlike most other fresh cheeses-cottage and cream
  cheese, for example-the curd of this bland, light cheese is fromed
  from the direct addition of acid to the milk, not by fermentation.
  For that reason the time required to make it is generally short.
   If you haven't used this Italian favorite before, try it in place of
  cottage cheese, as well as in Italian recipes for such dishes as
  lasagne and manicotti. You'll find it is a bit creamier than most
  cottage cheeses, with a much finer curd.
   For a pleasant light milk dessert, sweeten ricotta slightly and top
  it with a sprinkling of grated chocolate or cinnamon.

      Title: RICE & ALMOND PUDDING (RIS   L'AMANDE)
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Uncooked short-grain white r
  3 1/2 c  Milk
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      3 tb Sugar
    3/4 c  Chopped blanched almonds

MMMMM--------------------------CHERRY S-------------------------------
     16 oz Can dark sweet cherries
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 x  Water
      1 x  Cherry liqueur, if desired
 
    In a medium saucepan, combine  rice and milk. Cook over medium heat
  45 minutes or until rice is tender; set aside to cool. In a bowl whip
  cream until stiff; stir in vanilla. Stir whipped cream, sugar and
  chopped almonds into  the  cooled  rice. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours.
    Sauce:  Heat cherries  with  juice.  Dissolve cornstarch in a little
  water. Stir into cherries; gently stir over medium heat until thicked.
    Some  people like  the cherry  sauce served  hot with the rice
  pudding. In Denmark the tradition is to include 1 whole almond in the
  rice pudding. And the person to find it wins the prize ~ commonly a
  cute & tasty marzipan pig!

      Title: RICE & BARLEY STUFFING FOR CORNISH HENS
 Categories: Side dish, Poultry, Seasonings
      Yield: 4 Henfuls :)
 
    1/2 c  Rice
      2 tb Butter
  2 1/4 c  Water (or more)
      2    Chicken broth cubes
    1/3 c  Barley
      8 oz Cranberries, fresh; OR...
     16 oz -Canned cranberry sauce
           -- with gel rinsed off
           Sugar
           - if using fresh cranberries
      2 ts Bitter orange marmalade
           -- (heaping measure), OR...
           -- half marmalade -and-
           -- half diced orange peel
      2 tb Orange juice
    1/3 c  Raisins
      2 ts Rubbed sage
      2 ts Tarragon
    1/2 ts Sweet marjoram
      1 ts Crushed rosemary
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  Brown the rice in the butter, then add 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups water and
  chicken cube; cook until soft.
  
  Cook barley in 1 cup water and second chicken cube for
       45    minutes, or until tender.
  
  If using fresh cranberries, cook briefly with a little sugar to soften
  somewhat and create a little juice.
  
  Mix the remaining ingredients with the cooked rice and barley. Stuff
  the Cornish hens and cook according to instructions on package. I
  like to brush the stuffed birds with melted butter and sprinkle with
  salt, pepper, crushed basil, and tarragon.
  
  The stuffing may be frozen for future use.
  
  VARIATION: Substitute sliced mushrooms for the raisins.

           Water
    1/4 c  Rice
           Water
      6 tb Sugar
           Water
 
  Soak beans in water for 5 hours. Get rid of green skins, if any, that
  float to the surface; you might encourage then to come off by rubbing
  the beans between your hands; drain. Rinse rice three times in water;
  drain. Put rice and beans in a pot. Add 4 c water and bring to a boil
  for 1 minute; then lower the heat, and let simmer for 1 hr. Add sugar
  to taste (the 6 T called for might not be enough for Western tastes).
  Stir, ladle into soup bowls, and serve warm.

      1 ts Curry Powder
    1/4 ts Red Pepper Flakes

    2/3 c  Frozen Peas
 
  * (use white if you prefer, but since it doesn't take as long to
  cook, you may want to cook the vegetables a bit before adding the
  rice.)
  
  Put rice and liquid in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add
  curry, pepper flakes, carrots, celery, leek, kale and mushrooms.
  Return to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 35-40 minutes, or
  until most of the liquid is absorbed.  Add meat and peas, and cook
  another 5 minutes. Serve. This served 2 very (!) hungry adults. You
  could probably stretch it to 3 by adding a bit more rice and liquid

      Title: RICE & LENTIL SALAD
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Wild rice
      1 c  Long grain brown rice
      1 c  Green (French) lentils

MMMMM------------------------COMBINE WITH-----------------------------
      1 ea Red, yellow, green bell
           Pepper, chopped
      2 c  Small cherry tomatoes
      1    Or 2 carrots
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh basil (more or
           Less)
      1    To 2 tablespoon or chopped
           Fresh mint

MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
        x  Nonfat tomato-herb
        x  Red wine vinegar
 
  Cook grains separately, in 2 cups water, until done,
       45    minutes or less.
  
  For the dressing, I used a prepared nonfat tomato-herb dressing
  (Trader Joe's) mixed about half and half with red wine vinegar
  because I generally find prepared nonfat dressings too thick and too
  sweet for my taste. I didn't measure, but I used perhaps half a cup,
  maybe as much as a cup, total, just enough to moisten everything.
  
  I let it sit in the refrigerator all day, to let the flavors mix. I
  don't know how many people it served--it filled a large bowl-- but
  there wasn't any left over after the potluck (and while I was glad
  that everyone liked it, I was sorry not to have some to take home).

  1 1/2    Sticks butter
      3    Garlic cloves, finely
           -chopped

    1/3 c  Lea & Perrin's
           -Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 ts Celery salt
    1/2 ts Onion salt
      6    Beaten eggs
 
   Melt butter in large skillet. To butter, add garlic, onions, bell
  pepper and celery. Saute lightly and remove from pan, retaining
  butter. Add oysters and saute in remaining butter. (If oysters are
  small, they may remain whole. Large ones can be chopped after
  sauteed.) Oysters should be sauteed lightly, just until edges curl.
  Remove and set aside. Wash chicken livers thoroughly. Place in pan
  and add enough water to just cover them. Boil until done. Drain and
  slice finely. Combine everything but eggs into large bowl and mix
  together well with your hands. At this time, you can taste to adjust
  seasonings. According to personal taste, you might want to add more
  of the salts or cayenne. Now add the six beaten eggs and mix together
  well. Mixture should hold together without being too wet or dry.
  Adjust for moisture by draining liquid or adding additional chicken
  broth. Pour mixture into 4-quart casserole. Cover and warm in a
  325-deg. oven for about 20 minutes. You can also stuff a 25 pound
  turkey and cook. This recipe may be a side dish and serves 15 people.

 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
  1 1/2 ts White pepper
      1 ts Dry mustard
    1/2 ts Black pepper

MMMMM----------------------RICE INGREDIENTS---------------------------
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers
    1/2 c  Raisins
  1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice (converted)
      2 c  Chopped unpeeled apples
      1 c  Chopped onions
    1/2 c  Pecan halves, dry roasted
      4 tb Unsalted butter
      3 c  Pork, beef or chicken stock
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
   In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until very hot,
  about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2
  minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the pecans (we ran out of
  pecans, so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and continue
  cooking for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the raisins
  and butter (these are added together so the raisins will absorb as
  much butter as possible). Stir until butter is melted, then cook
  until raisins are plump, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add
  the rice and seasoning mix and cook until rice starts looking frizzly
  (a bit like ce Krispies) Chef Prudhomme recommended using converted
  rice. Lucy used brown, long grain rice - super!. This will require
  about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring almost constantly before the rice
  looks "frizzly". Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom well, then
  stir in the apples. Cover pan and bring to boil; lower heat and
  simmer covered for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit,
  *COVERED*, until rice is tender and stock is absorbed, about 30
  minutes. (We cook the rice this slow way to let the flavors build to
  their maximum.) Serve immediately, allowing about 3/4 cup per person.

  Suppli al Telefono To quote the author, "It is not easy to make
  Suppli al Telefono. Nevertheless, it pays to make the effort once in
  awhile because this dish always makes family and guests happy. The
  name comes from the fact that a thread of cheese will spin between
  your mouth and the suppli while you are eating it, resembling the
  mouthpiece of an early model telephone from the time this dish was
  first created. Suppl can be served as an appetizer, as a side dish in
  a dairy meal, or as a meal in itself for a lunch or brunch. ...Suppli
  should be served piping hot. Tell your guests, who might have never
  had them before, that suppli should be eaten with the fingers." Place
  rice, onion and olive oil in 2 qt saucepan and saute 2 or 3 minutes,
  stirring frequently. Add salt and 3 1/2 cups hot water. Bring to a
  boil. Lower heat to minimum and cook, covered, without stirring, 15
  minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, uncovered, 5 minutes longer, stirring
  frequently. The rice should now be quite dry. Remove from heat and
  cool for 15 to 20 minutes, add eggs and mix well. With damp hands,
  shape heaping tablespoons of the mixture into croquettes the size of
  a large egg; insert one piece of cheese into each croquette, making
  sure that the cheese is completely coated with rice. Roll in bread
  crumbs and fry a few at a time in hot oil till golden brown on all
  sides. SERVES: 6

      5 tb All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Cake flour
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom or cinnamon
  2 1/2 tb Sugar
      3 ts Cold butter, diced
      1 tb Canola oil
 
  2-2 1/2 tb very cold water The low-calorie rice pudding flan is so
  delicious by itself that you may want to save the calories and fat in
  the crust, and serve it without the pastry. Bring nonfat milk to boil
  in medium saucepan. Add vanilla bean and rice. Cover partially and
  simmer until rice is almost tender, about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Stir in sugar and continue and continue cooking 3
  minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Remove vanilla bean.
  Blend egg substitute with ricotta cheese. Stir into rice mixture with
  candied ginger. Carefully pour into prepared pastry shell, filling
  almost to the top (if there is any flan mixture left from incomplete
  reduction in cooking, place in small custard dish, cover and
  microwave 40 to 60 seconds or until set.) Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon
  cinnamon. Bake at 400 degrees F. 25 to 30 minutes or until set.
  Remove from oven. Sift powdered sugar over and sprinkle with
  remaining cinnamon. Serve warm and garnish with sliced ginger if
  desired. Makes 12 servings. Each serving contains about: 183
  calories; 102 mg sodium; 11 mg cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 31 grams
  carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 0.25 gram fiber. The use of oat flour
  blend and cake flour is what gives this low-fat crust its tenderness.
  It also makes it more difficult to roll, but don't despair: The dough
  is easily patched. Low-Fat Sweet Pastry Sift flour, cardamom and
  sugar into large bowl. Rub in butter with fingers or cut in with
  pastry blender until size of small peas. Using fork, stir in oil.
  Slowly add cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time, tossing with fork until
  flour is moistened without being wet. Gather dough with moist hands,
  shape into flattened round and let rest about 15 minutes. Roll
  1/8-inch thick on lightly floures board. (To facilitate rolling,
  dough may also be rolled between sheets of wax paper Or unrolled
  dough may be placed in pan and gently pressed  to cover inside of
  pan.) Gently lift and press onto 9-inch square tart pan with
  removable bottom. Cut off dough edges. Bake at 425 degrees F. 10 to
  15 minutes or until golden brown. Makes 12 servings. NOTE: Unsalted
  butter will give a more delicate fresh flavor in this pastry. Add a
  dash of salt if using.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 qt Milk
      1 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Rice, washed
 
  This is a recipe from mom's childhood.  The directions use tea cups,
  lumps of butter the size of a walnut and rice (washed but not
  precooked.) This is not a sweet dessert but a side dish to be served
  at family reunions with turkey, chicken, and as an alternate to
  potatoes. The directions suggest putting together in a slow oven for
  about 1 hour. Stir in the brown top from time to time.
  
  The recipe came from my Grest Aunt Kate and was a favorite at parties
  in Greenwich Village in the 1920's.

      2 c  Water
    3/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Unsalted Butter -- * see
           Note
      1 tb Fine Bread Crumbs --
           (approximately)
      4 lg Eggs
      1 c  Stout -- ** see note
      1 c  Whipping Cream
    1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
      1 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/8 ts Ground Cloves
    1/4 lb Pitted Dates -- chopped (2/3
           Cup)
      2 tb All-Purpose Flour --
           (approximately)
 
  * plus more for the baking dish
  
  ** (a sweet Stout in the English style -including those labeled
  Oatmeal Stout, Milk Stout, or Imperial Stout- will provide a mellow
  richness and overtones of coffee and chocolate, but a dry Irish-style
  Stout is likely to be to bitter. Some brands of Porter might also
  work if on the sweet side.)
  
  1. Combine the rice, water, and salt in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a
  boil, reduce the heat, cover, and cook until the water is absorbed,
  about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, fluff with fork, cover, and let
  cool.
  
  2. Butter the bottom and sides of a 6-cup baking disk or 8 individual
  casseroles (ramekins). Sprinkle with bread crumbs and roll the dish
  around to coat all the surface with crumbs. Tap out excess.
  
  3. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Beat the eggs lightly in a large
  bowl. Add the Stout, 1/3 cup of the cream, vanilla, sugar, and spices
  and stir to combine. Add the rice and stir to break up any clumps.
  Toss the dates in flour to coat them evenly, shaking off the excess,
  and stir them in. Pour the mixture into the baking dish. Cut the
  butter into small pieces and scatter them on top. Bake uncovered
  until set, about 1 hour. Serve warm, with the rest of the cream,
  lightly whipped.
  
  Serves 8.

  see. When the rice is done, fry the raisins and almonds in a little
  oil and mix into the rice. Do not overcook the rice - it will get

  Take an umeboshi plum and chop it into little pieces distributed
  through the rice. Lay some of this rice out on a piece of sushi nori
  (that's nori sheets that have been roasted), and roll it up closing
  the ends. Do this while the rice is still warm and it sticks together
  perfectly. When you bite a piece off, the seaweed wrapper closes
  itself with help from your teeth so the rice doesn't fall out.

      Yield: 2 Servings
 
     75 g  Long-grain rice
     25 g  Wild rice
      2 tb White-wine vinegar

      3 tb Parsley, finely chopped
           Salt and pepper
 
  Rice salads, like risottos, can be made through all the seasons of
  the year using fresh vegetables of your choice. This one is very
  simply made with olives, spring onions and parsley, and dressed with
  oil and vinegar. Lovely as part of a cold table with a variety of
  salads to go with it.
  
  Cook the two rices separately, as instructed on the packets. Whisk
  together the vinegar with the oil, and season with salt and pepper.
  Dress the warm rice with the mixture. Toss in the stuffed olives,
  spring onions and parsley and mix well. Leave at room temperature for
  a few hours so that the flavours can amalgamate before serving.

      Title: RICE WITH APPLE & RAISIN DRESSING
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts White pepper
      1 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Dry mustard
      1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Black pepper

MMMMM----------------------RICE INGREDIENTS---------------------------
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 c  Chopped onions
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers
    1/2 c  Pecan halves, dry roasted
    1/2 c  Raisins
      4 tb Unsalted butter
  1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice (converted)
      3 c  Pork, beef or chicken stock
      2 c  Chopped unpeeled apples
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
     In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until very hot,
  about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2
  minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the pecans (we ran out of pecans,
  so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and continue cooking for
  about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the raisins and butter
  (these are added together so the raisins will absorb as much butter
  as possible). Stir until butter is melted, then cook until raisins
  are plump, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the rice and
  seasoning mix and cook until rice starts looking frizzly (a bit like
  ce Krispies) Chef Prudhomme recommended using converted rice. Lucy
  used brown, long grain rice - super!. This will require about 2 to 3
  minutes, stirring almost constantly before the rice looks "frizzly".
  Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom well, then stir in the apples.
  Cover pan and bring to boil; lower heat and simmer covered for 5
  minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice is
  tender and stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes. (We cook the rice
  this slow way to let the flavors build to their maximum.)
    Serve immediately, allowing about 3/4 cup per person. From Paul
  Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen"

      Yield: 6 Servings

    1/2 c  Olive oil

      3 c  -cold water
  1 1/2 c  Rice; short grained;Arborio
           -is best
 
  Risotto Coi Carciofi To quote the author," In Pitigliano it was
  traditionally served during Passover*, when artichokes are in season
  and tender". *"Other differences (between Italian Jews and Ashkenazic
  Jews) stem from the fact that some foods are not considered kosher by
  the Ashkenazim are permitted by the Italkim or Sephardim and vice
  versa. For example, rice, which was a staple for us at Passover, is
  considered chamtaz, or leavened food, by the Ashkenazim, whereas
  chocolate, cheese, and other milk products, so widely used by the
  American Jews during Passover, were absolutely forbidden for us,
  because we considered them to be chametz." Trim artichokes; remove
  any choke and slice very thin. Heat oil thoroughly in a large skillet
  and add the artichoke slices. Season with 2 teaspoons salt and pepper
  to taste. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently , for
  approximately 5 minutes. Lower heat to medium and cook, stirring
  frequently, another 10 minutes. Bring 3 cups of water with 1 tsp salt
  to a boil. Add rice and cook, covered, for 12 to 15 minutes. Add to
  skillet with artichokes and stir to combine. SERVES: 6

      Title: RICE-FLOUR DOSAS WITH MUSTARD SEEDS & BLACK
 Categories: Bakery, Indian, Breakfast, Snacks, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Pancakes
 
      1 c  All-purpose white flour
      1 c  Rice flour
    1/8 ts Cayenne pepper (or more)
    1/2 c  Peeled and chopped onion
    1/4 c  Freshly grated coconut
  1 1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Plain soy yogurt
      7 tb Vegetable oil (about)
      1 ts Whole black mustard seeds
      1 ts Black peppercorns
           -- (coarsley crushed
           -- or very coarsely ground)
 
  In a food processor or blender, blend together white flour, rice
  flour, cayenne, onion, coconut, salt, yogurt, and 3/4 cup water until
  smooth. Transfer mixture to a bowl.
  
  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet set over medium heat and cook
  mustard seeds until they begin to pop. Add seeds and oil, along with
  black pepper, to batter; stir to combine thoroughly.
  
  Have all cooking paraphernalia ready and at hand.  You will need to
  have near your skillet: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of vegetable oil in a cup or
  bowl with a small spoon, a larger spoon to spread the batter, the
  bowl of batter with a 1/3-cup measuring scoop/cup, a metal spatula
  for turning the pancakes, and a plate on which to place the finished
  dosas after they are cooked.
  
  Pour 1 teaspoon of oil into the skillet and tilt to distribute
  evenly. Heat the skillet over medium-low until oil is hot. Pour 1/3
  cup of the mixture onto the center of the hot skillet. Use the large
  spoon to spread the batter in a spiral motion, until the pancake is
  about 6-7 inches in diameter.  Turn pancake after 2 minutes and cook
  another 2 minutes on the other side. Remove pancake to plate and
  repeat with remaining batter, adding only enough additional oil to
  the skillet as needed to keep surface evenly greased. I found that
  about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon for each pancake was plenty, but your
  mileage may vary.
  
  Serve right away, or reheat (wrapped in aluminum foil) in a 400 F.
  oven for 15 minutes.
  
  Serve with relishes, pickles, chutney, or cooked vegetables.

      Title: RICE-FLOUR-SOY SAUCE CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 80 Servings
 
      1 c  Rice flour
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Oil
      2 tb Soy sauce or Tamari, to
           Taste
      1    Egg white, lightly beaten
    1/4 c  Buttermilk or rehydrated
           Buttermilk powder
 
  "Rice flour gives these simple crackers a slightly grainy texture,
  and the soy sauce lends a lovely brown tint. This is just the cracker
  to serve as a light afternoon snack with pot of green tea. 325~F. 15
  to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  Combine the flours in a large bowl or in the food processor. Add the
  oil and blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in the
  soy sauce and egg white. Blend in enough of the buttermilk, little by
  little, to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/16 inch thick. With a sharp
  knife or a cookie cutter, cut into 2-inch circles or squares. Place
  the crackers on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
  Prick each one with a fork in 2 or 3 places.
  
  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until crisp, turning over once during
  baking. Cool on a rack. Yield: 70-80.

 Categories: Italian, Rice
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  Long grain rice
      4 c  Water
    1/2 lb Chopped meat
    1/2    Medium onion; chopped
      1    Salt & pepper to taste
      1    Garlic powder to taste
    1/4 c  Peas
    1/4 c  Tomato sauce
    1/4 lb Diced mozzarella
      3    Eggs
      1    Tomato sauce for color
      3 tb Grated cheese
      1    Garlic powder to taste
      1    Salt, pepper, parsley
 
  Wash and drain rice.  Boil water in saucepan over high heat. Add the
  drained rice and bring to a boil.  Stir once, reduce heat to low,
  cover and simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al
  dente and slightly sticky, about 17 minutes. Remove from heat and
  cool to room temperature. Heat oil in a large saute pan over
  medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until soft, about 5
  minutes.  Add the chopped meat and seasoning and saute until the meat
  just loses its raw color, about 5 minutes longer. Add the tomato
  sauce and peas and cook until the liquid evaporates and the peas are
  just tender, about 10 minutes longer for fresh peas, or about 5
  minutes for thawed. In a mixing bowl, beat 2 of the eggs. Add the
  cooled rice and the grated cheese and seasonings.  Scoop about 3 Tbl
  of the rice mixture into the palm of one hand (wet hands first) and
  press it out to form an even round. Place about 1/2 Tbl of the meat
  mixture and one small chunk mozzarella in the center of the patty,
  then gently close your hand to encase the filling in the rice. Use
  both hands to roll the stuffed rice into a ball. Continue making
  balls until all ingredients are used. Beat the remaining 1-2 eggs in
  a small bowl and pour the bread crumbs into a small bowl. Roll each
  rice ball in the egg to coat completely, then roll in the bread
  crumbs to cover well. Set aside until all balls are coated. Pour oil
  in a deep fryer or saucepan to a depth of 4 inches. Heat to 360F.
  Carefully drop the rice balls, a few at a time, into oil and fry,
  turning frequently, until golden brown all around, about 5 minutes.
  With a slotted utensil, transfer to paper toweling to drain. If
  desired, place in a low oven to keep warm until all are cooked. Serve
  warm.

      2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts White pepper
      1 ts Garlic powder

      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers
    1/2 c  Pecan halves, dry roasted
    1/2 c  Raisins
      4 tb Unsalted butter
  1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice (converted)
      3 c  Pork, beef or chicken stock
      2 c  Chopped unpeeled apples
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
     In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until very hot,
  about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2
  minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the pecans (we ran out of pecans,
  so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and continue cooking for
  about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the raisins and butter
  (these are added together so the raisins will absorb as much butter
  as possible). Stir until butter is melted, then cook until raisins
  are plump, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the rice and
  seasoning mix and cook until rice starts looking frizzly (a bit like
  ce Krispies) Chef Prudhomme recommended using converted rice. Lucy
  used brown, long grain rice - super!. This will require about 2 to 3
  minutes, stirring almost constantly before the rice looks "frizzly".
  Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom well, then stir in the apples.
  Cover pan and bring to boil; lower heat and simmer covered for 5
  minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice is
  tender and stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes. (We cook the rice
  this slow way to let the flavors build to their maximum.)
    Serve immediately, allowing about 3/4 cup per person. From Paul

      Title: RICH CHICKEN STOCK
 Categories: Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  7 1/2 lb Whole chicken and parts,
           -such as backs, feet, wings
      6 qt Cold water
      8 sl Unpeeled fresh ginger
      8    Whole scallions, cut into
           -pieces
      2 ts Salt
 
  Stock is the foundation of all good cooking.  I emphasize this
  because it is so important a principle. Good stock, especially
  chicken stock, is necessary for the cuisine of Hong Kong, whose
  subtle flavors, fresh ingredients, and fast cook cooking techniques
  require very good stock. Light, flavorful, and versatile chicken
  stock should be considered a staple, to set beside salt, cooking oil,
  or soy sauce.
  
  There are commercially prepared canned or cube stocks but many of
  them are of inferior quality, being either too salty or containing
  additives and colorings that adverse affect your health as well as
  the natural taste of good foods.  Make your own, it is the best. You
  can make a big batch and freeze it for your own use when needed. In
  making a good stock, here are a few rules to remember:
  
  * It is best to use about 50 percent bones and 50 percent meat.
  Without meat, the stock will not have the necessary body or richness
  or depth of flavor and will taste watery. Stewing old hens is best if
  you can find them, because they are inexpensive and full of flavor.
  
  * Stock should simmer.  Never let the stock come to a boil because
  that will result in a cloudy and heavy stock. Flavors and digest-
  ibility come with a clear stock.
  
  * Use a tall heavy pot so the liquid covers all the solids and
  evaporation is slow.
  
  * Simmer on low heat and gently skim the stock every now and then to
  remove any impurities.
  
  * Strain the stock slowly through several layers of cheese cloth or a
  fine mesh strainer.
  
  * Allow the stock to cool thoroughly before storing in the re-
  frigerator or freezer.
  
  If you make a habit of saving your uncooked chicken bones and
  carcasses, you will have the essential ingredients for stock in no
  time. It makes good economical sense also.
  
  The stock should be rich and full-bodied, which is why it needs to be
  simmered for such a long time.  This way the stock (and any soup you
  make with it) will have plenty of taste. With a good, stock, you will
  also get good sauces for a true taste of Hong Kong!
  
  Cut up the chicken and put the pieces and parts together into a very
  large pot.  Cover them with the cold water and bring the stock to a
  simmer. Using a large, flat spoon, gently skim off the scum as it
  rises from the bones. Watch the heat as the stock should never, boil.
  Keep skimming until the stock looks clear. This can take from 30 to
  40 minutes. Do not stir or disturb the stock.
  
  Turn the heat down to a low simmer and add the ginger, scallions, and
  salt. Simmer the stock on a very low heat for at least 3 hours,
  skimming any fat off the top at least twice during this time. Strain
  the stock through several layers of dampened cheesecloth or through a
  very fine mesh strainer, and then let it cool thoroughly. Remove any
  fat that has risen to the top. It is now ready to be used or
  transferred to containers and frozen for future use.
  
  Makes 6 quarts.

    450 g  Seedless raisins
    230 g  Currants
    230 g  Mixed peel
    230 g  Glace pineapple
    230 g  Glace apricots
      4 tb Brandy
      4 tb Sherry
    230 g  Prunes
    450 g  Buffer
    450 g  Brown sugar
     12 x  61 g eggs [Hunh? S.C.]
    450 g  Plain flour
    115 g  Rice flour
      1 ts Parisian essence [Hunh?,
           -again... S.C.]
      2 tb Ultra-strong coffee.
 
  Everyone knows that there never was Christmas cake as good as the one
  Mum makes.  Well, here it is.  With surpassing generosity, Raw
  Materials' Mum gave permission for the family recipe, used down the
  years, to appear here, its imperial measures at last converted to
  metric. [Lucky us, eh... ;-} S.C.]
  
  Clean and prepare all fruit except the prunes.  Pick over vine fruit
  and remove any stems.  Chop the larger fruit into small pieces (a
  pair of scissors does the job more easily than a knife). Mix the
  fruits in a bowl and add brandy and sherry.  Cover tightly and leave
  overnight or longer.
  
  Prepare one deep 23 cm square cake tin (or, for one cake to keep and
  one to give, one 20 cm square tin and one 15 cm square). Grease the
  interior of the tin(s) with butter. Line with two layers of brown
  paper cut to fit and to project above the sides of the tin by about 5
  cm.
  
  Inside the brown paper, fit a layer of grease proof paper, projecting
  similarly.  Butter the inside of the grease proof. Pit and chop the
  prunes. Cream the butter and sugar well. Add the eggs, one at a time,
  mixing each in thoroughly.  Add prunes.
  
  Sift flours together and add the butter-sugar mixture alternately
  with the fruit.  Add the essence and coffee.
  
  Put the mixture into the prepared tins(s).  Dip one hand in cold
  water and pat the surface of the cake flat. (The thin layer of water
  keeps the surface moist for a long time and lessens the chance of the
  cake rising in the middle.) Bake in a preheated 150C oven for 1 hour,
  then reduce the heat to 135C and cook for a further 2 1/4 hours.
  
  Take the cake from the oven and fold the extra paper layers over the
  top of the cake, tin and all, while still hot in at least 4 layers of
  newspaper. Place on a rack and leave overnight. (This process keeps
  the cake moist and prevents it cracking on top while it cools.) In
  the morning, remove from the tin, peel off the paper and store the
  cakes(s) in an airtight tin.

           -Cocoa
    1/8 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Butter
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Line 8-or 9-inch square pan with foil; butter foil. In heavy 4-quart
  saucepan, stir together sugar, cocoa and salt; stir in milk. Cook over
  medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to full rolling
  boil. Boil, without stirring, to 234 degrees Fahrenheit or until
  syrup, when dropped into very cold water, forms a soft ball which
  flattens when removed from water. (Bulb of candy thermometer should
  not rest on bottom of saucepan). Remove from heat. Add butter and
  vanilla. Do not stir. Cool at room temperature to 110 degrees
  Fahrenheit (lukewarm). Beat with wooden spoon until fudge thickens
  and loses some of its gloss. Spread quickly into prepared pan; cool.
  Cut into squares. About 36 pieces or 1-3/4 pounds.
  
  NOTE: For best results, do not double this recipe. Variations:
  
  Nutty Rich Cocoa Fudge: Beat cooked fudge as directed. Immediately
  stir in 1 cup chopped almonds, pecans or walnuts and spread quickly
  into prepared pan.
  
  Marshmallow-Nut Cocoa Fudge: Increase cocoa to 3/4 cup. Cook fudge as
  directed. Add 1 cup marshmallow creme with butter and vanilla. Do not
  stir. Cool to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (lukewarm). Beat 8 minutes; stir
  in 1 cup chopped nuts and pour into prepared pan. (Fudge does not set
  until poured into pan). High Altitude Directions
  
  Increase milk to 1-2/3 cups.
  
  Use soft ball cold water test for doneness or test and read
  thermometer in boiling water, subtract difference from 212 degrees
  Fahrenheit. Then subtract that number from 234 degrees Fahrenheit.
  This is the soft ball temperature for your altitude and thermometer.

      Title: RICH COCONUT MILK
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Ripe  coconut,
      1 x  With a brown, hard shell
      5 c  Very hot water
 
  Bake the coconut in a 400 F oven for 15 - 20 minutes; a little more
  will not hurt.  Remove coconut from the oven and give it several hard
  whackw with a hammer to break it open and into 4 or 5 pieces. The
  coconut water will drain away and is not used. Pry away the coconut
  meat from the shell; use a dull knife to eliminate the possibility of
  running the knife through one's fingers. Cut the meat into
  1-inch-wide strips and then into horizontal thin slices. Put about 3
  cups of the slices into a blender and pour in 4 cups of water (the
  less water, the richer the coconut milk). Process for about 1 minute,
  which will be enough time to cut up the coconut and release the milk.
  Pour the mixture through a metal sieve and squeeze out the coconut
  fragments.  The liquid that remains is coconut milk. It can be stored
  in the referator for 3 days, or it can be frozen in plastic
  containers for future use. Source: False Tongues and Sunday Bread by

      Title: RICH CREAM - KAYMAKI
 Categories: Misc
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 qt Heavy cream
 
  Thick rich eastern Mediterranean "kaymaki" (literally, "frothy
  cream") is unique, but two more readily available products have a
  similar flavor and texture. Imported English clotted (Devon) cream
  and Italian mascarpone cheese both make good substitutes, or you cna
  make your own. Make this when you plan to be in the kitchen for a
  couple of hours - for an even smooth texture and a thick crust you
  need to stir the hot cream at regular intervals.  Be sure to use
  meticulously clean utensils and keep the cooking heat very low (or
  use a heat diffuser mat). Kaymaki should be made at least 18 hours
  before you need it; it can be stored for up to a week. Slowly bring
  the cream almost to a boil in a heavy saucepan, stirring occasionally
  with a wooden spoon. Reduce the heat to as low as possible, or place
  the saucepan on a heat diffuser mat.  Lift a ladleful of cream about
  12 inches above the saucepan, and pour it back in a thin steady
  stream; repeat 2 or 3 times. Repeat this procedure every 10 minutes
  or so over the next 1-1/2 hours, and stir the cream occasionally to
  make sure it does not stick. Leave the cream undisturbed over the
  lowest heat for 30 minutes longer; it will have reduced by at least
  two thirds. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let cool. Loosely
  cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside for 2 hours. Remove
  the kitchen towel, tightly cover, and refrigerate for at least 12
  hours, or overnight. Cut the crust on top of the cream into
  1-inch-wide strips.  Gently fold one end of a strip over the handle
  of a wooden spoon and roll it up (cut in half if the roll becomes too
  thick or unwieldy), and slide off onto a plate. Repeat with the
  remaining strips. The remaining kaymaki will have the texture of
  thick airless cream. It can be refrigerated in a tightly covered
  container of up to 1 week; refrigerate the rolls for up to 3 days.
  Note: Serve kaymaki rolls on their own or with desserts such as
  Kataifi Nut Rolls or Almond Cake. Kaymaki cream can be added to ice
  cream or rice pudding for an especially good flavor. Or whisk it
  together with a little sweet wine or lemon juice for a perfect
  accompaniment to fresh or poached fruit or sweet pastries.

      Title: RICH EGG PIZZA DOUGH
 Categories: Pizza
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 tb Sweet butter, cut into 4
           -pieces
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Instant nonfat dry milk
           -powder
    3/4 c  Water
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  4 1/2    To 5 cups all purpose white
           -flour
      1 ts Salt
      3    Extra large eggs, beaten
 
  "For an elegant change of pace, this rich brioche-like dough makes a
  thick, utterly delicious pizza crust. French Provencale pizza or
  pissaladiere fillings are exceptionally good on it. Its most
  spectacular presentation though, comes in the form of torta rustica
  with its majestic crown of dough leaves and multilayered colorful
  filling. This dough is characteristically soft.  Work it only until
  it no longer sticks to your fingers. For an extra golden, shiny
  finish, brush a thin coating of egg white glaze (1 egg white beaten
  with a Tbsp of water) over the top of the dough."
  
  1. Put the butter, sugar, dry milk powder, and water in a small
  saucepan. Stir briefly to dissolve the solids and heat the mixture
  over medium heat until bubbles begin to appear around the sides of
  the pan. Remove from the heat and pour the mixture into a large
  mixing bowl.
  
  2. When the liquid mixture no longer feels too hot to the touch( no
  more than 130 degrees)sprinkle the yeast over it and stir with a fork
  until the yeast dissolves.
  
  3. Stir in 2 cups of the flour, the salt, and eggs with a wooden
  spoon.
  
  4. Add about a cup of flour 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until the
  dough forms a soft, sticky mass and comes away from the sides of the
  bowl.
  
  5. Dust your hands and the work surface liberally with some of the
  remaining flour.  Remove the dough form the bowl and knead in the
  remaining flour a bit at a time, until the dough is smooth and
  elastic and no longer sticks to your hands.  Don't try to push all of
  the flour into the dough. You may not need it all.
  
  6. Roll the dough around in an oiled bowl, cover the bowl tightly with
  plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place until it has
  doubled in bulk (about 1 hour).
  
  7. Punch the dough down, knead it briefly, and return it to the bowl.
  Recover with plastic wrap and let it double again before using (This
  dough must go through
        2    risings.)
  
  8. After the dough has doubled in bulk a second time, it is ready to
  be rolled or pressed into shape. Note: For thicker crust, let the
  dough rise in a prepared pizza pan for 30 minutes before baking. This
  dough should not be baked at temperatures above "400 degrees" or it
  will burn.

      Title: RICH FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE TORTE
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Granulated sugar
  1 1/2 c  Light corn syrup
     20 oz Good quality semisweet
           Chocolate, preferably French
           Or Belgian
           Cut into small pieces plus,
      8 oz Additional
           Chocolate
      2    Sticks (16 tablespoons)
           Unsalted butter
     10    Whole eggs
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
  
  In a heavy bottomed pot, combine the sugar and corn syrup and bring
  to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes.  Remove
  from the heat.  Melt the 20 ounces chopped chocolate in the top of a
  double boiler over simmering water.  Stir the chocolate occasionally
  as it melts. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter. Set
  aside to cool slightly. With an electric mixer, beat the eggs at high
  speed until frothy. Lower the speed to medium and carefully pour the
  hot syrup into the beaten eggs. Add the melted chocolate and butter
  mixture and blend to a smooth consistency. Butter a 10 inch to 12inch
  round cake pan lightly and pour in the chocolate mixture.  Set the
  cake pan into a larger pan (such as a roasting pan) and add hot water
  to rise halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Place in the preheated
  oven and bake about 45 to 50 minutes.
  
  Being very careful not to scald yourself or get water into the torte,
  remove the pans from the oven, and remove the cake pan from the water
  bath. Cool the torte completely to room temperature before unmolding.
  Run a sharp knife around the inner circumference of the pan. Place a
  plate over the pan, invert, and, if necessary, tap the bottom of the
  pan with the knife handle to encourage the torte to release.
  
  The torte should then be refrigerated for at least 3 hours before
  serving. While the torte is cooling, place the heavy cream in a thick
  bottomed pot and begin to heat gently.  Add the remaining 8 ounces of
  chocolate, stir together while the chocolate begins to melt in the
  hot cream. Being careful not to burn, boil or scorch the chocolate,
  when the chocolate has melted almost entirely, remove from the heat
  and allow to cool for several minutes before pouring over the torte
  for a glossy "finish". Place the unmolded torte on a baking rack with
  a cookie sheet underneath, and pour slightly cooled chocolate ganache
  directly onto the center of the torte in one motion so that it will
  flow out in one smooth sheet over the top and sides of the torte.
  You can gently help this along with the aid of a spatula but is
  important to use still warmed ganache.
  
  Allow to dry a few moments at room temperature.  Then place the torte,
  baking rack, and cookie sheet into the refrigerator to chill
  completely and set firm.  If you haven't overheated the chocolate or
  cream, this "ganache" will set and harden into a shiny "couverture"
  during the hour the torte is chilling in the refrigerator.

  Set a slow oven.
  
  Prepare the fruit by cutting into uniform size. For competi- tion
  this is best done with scissors. Put all the fruit in a large glass
  jar and then pour over the spirit mixture. Seal well and leave for
  about a week.
  
  Prepare a 21 cm (8 in) cake tin before you start.
  
  Cream the butter and the brown sugar with the grated rind and the
  essence.
  
  Add the eggs one at a time beating well. Make sure the mixture does
  not curdle, add a small amount of flour if it begins to do so.

  (flour and spices) over the fruit.
  
  Then gradually add the fruit mixture to the creamed butter mixture,
  breaking up lumps of fruit as you go.]
  
  Sift in remaining dry ingredients with this until it is all used.
  Make sure it is well mixed, pour into the prepared tin and shake the
  tin well to settle the mixture.
  
  Then wet your hands, and pat the surface level with a wet hand to
  help give a nice finish. Give the tin one or two hard taps to break
  the air bubbles.
  
  Get two pages of the Herald and fold three times to make a long
  collar for the outside of the tin. Tie securely.
  
  Put a piece of heavy cardboard in the oven and rest the cake tin on
  it to stop the bottom burning.
  
  Cook in a slow oven for approximately four hours.
  
  Hal(way through put a sheet of brown paper over the top to stop it
  getting too brown on top.
  
  After four hours test to make sure it's cooked and then remove from
  the oven and leave to cool in the tin, covered with a clean cloth.
  Remove from tin, wrap greaseproof paper and foil and seal in an
  airtight container.
  
  Develops full flavour after a month.

      Title: RICH HOLIDAY POUND CAKE
 Categories: Christmas, Holiday, Cakes
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Butter, soft
      8 oz Cream cheese, soft
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
      5 ea Eggs, separated
      2 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Baking pan: one 10 1/2-inch tube pan, three inches deep
     OR two 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch loaf pans
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease and flour the baking pan or pans.
  Stir or whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside.
  Cream the butter and the cream cheese until light and smooth.
  Gradually add two cups of the sugar, blending well after each
  addition. Add the egg yolks and vanilla and beat well. Add the dry
  ingredients slowly, blending well after each addition. With clean,
  dry beaters, beat the egg whites until frothy; add the remaining 1/2
  cup of sugar. Continue beating until the egg whites hold firm,
  flossy, moist peaks. Fold a third of the egg whites into the batter
  to lighten it; fold the rest of the egg whites into the lightened
  batter. (The lightened batter is still quite thick, so folding in the
  rest of the egg whites takes some energy.) Pour the batter into the
  prepared tube pan or divide it equally between the two prepared loaf
  pans. Bake either tube or loaves for 55-60 minutes, or until a cake

      5    Egg yolks
 
  Heat cream, milk and sugar in heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar
  dissolves. Add egg yolks by adding some mixture to eggs to dilute,
  and then adding diluted eggs to rest of pan (adding straight will
  cook them and make for lumpy cream). Whisk constantly over med heat
  until mixture coats the back of a spoon (seems to take forever, about
  10 min?). DO NOT LET BOIL (or it will curdle) Strain, if you want,
  and add vanilla (I never strain, it comes out fine). Cool completely
  in refrigerator. Freeze according to manufacturers instructions.
  Makes about 1 quart. ( I double this if using the hand crank - it has
  a much larger capacity, but doesn't seem to last any longer after its
  made.... Hmmm....)

 Categories: Meats, Soups/stews
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Good stewing venison
           -- (trimmed weight)
      1    Onion
    3/4 lb Small flat mushrooms
  2 1/2 fl Red wine vinegar
  2 1/2 fl Water
    3/4 pt (scant) beef or game stock
           Butter
           Oil
           Flour
           Sugar
           Bay leaves

MMMMM------------------FOR THE FORCEMEAT BALLS-----------------------
      8 oz Fresh breadcrumbs
      8 oz Grated suet
      2    Lemons (grated zest only)
  1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
      1 lg Egg
      3 tb Fresh chopped parsley
 
  Cut the venison into large chunks and marinate for about 24 hours in
  the water and vinegar with 2 bay leaves and plenty of pepper.
  
  Make the forcemeat mixture, seasoning it well and binding it with the
  lightly beaten egg.  Shape into 24 small balls, fry briskly until
  golden- brown and crisp and reserve. Then fry the mushrooms hard in a
  very little hot fat.  Remove and reserve separately.
  
  Drain and dry the meat well, reserving the marinade. Dust the venison
  with well-seasoned flour and brown and seal in batches. Transfer it
  to a 4 pint flameproof casserole; ideally this should be no more than
  8 inches in diameter across the top.  Chop the onion finely and fry
  gently. Sprinkle on 2 tablespoons flour, pour on the marinade liquid
  and the stock over the meat and season with salt, pepper, 1/2
  teaspoon sugar and 2 bay leaves.
  
  Bring to a bare simmer, cover tightly and cook over the lowest
  possible flame (or in a low oven if you prefer) until the meat is
  deliciously tender and the gravy is dark and rich. Shoulder meat may
  need as little as 1 1/2 hours, lesser cuts of meat will need
  considerably more. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. When ready,
  remove the bay and check seasoning. Cool and refrigerate overnight if
  not to be served on the same day.
  
  To finish the dish, bring everything back to room temperature. Add the
  prepared mushrooms to the stew, pushing them well down into the
  gravy, then cover the surface with the forcemeat balls and bake -
  without a lid to keep the forcemeat balls really crisp - at 400 F
  (200 C) gas mark 6 for about 25 minutes.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      2 tb Sweet butter
      2 tb Honey
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar or honey
      4    Eggs
      6 c  Unbleached white flour
 
  Makes 2 large loaves
  
  In a saucepan scald the milk; add butter, 2 Tbsp honey, ginger and
  salt. Cool.
  
  In a large bowl dissolve the yeast in the warm water with the sugar or
  honey.  When this is bubbly, add cooled milk mixture. Add eggs, one
  at a time, beating well after each.
  
  Add 3 cups of the flour and beat thoroughly for at least 5 minutes
  with an electric mixer.  (A finer texture will result if you can let
  this sponge sit, covered with a towel, for an hour or so.) Beat in 3
  more cups flour or enough to form a mass which clings together,
  leaving the sides of the bowl. You may have to resort to a wooden
  spoon at this point.
  
  Cover and let dough rise in its bowl until it has doubled in bulk.
  Stir down with a wooden spoon and divide equally between two 9x5-inch
  buttered loaf pans. You may feel like you are pulling taffy but don't
  give up. Smooth the dough out as best you can with the spoon or your
  hands. Cover and let the dough rise until it reaches the tops of the
  pans. Preheat oven to 375F. Bake 25 - 30 minutes or until the loaves
  sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.  Remove from the pans and put
  directly on the oven rack for another couple of minutes baking.

      Title: RICK EASTES'S BERRY SORBET
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Blackberries,rinsed/drained
      2 c  Raspberries,rinsed/drained
    1/2 c  Powdered fructose
    1/2 c  Water
      2 tb Lime juice
           Blackberries,rinsed/drained*
           Raspberries,rinsed/drained*
           Black-raspberry liqueur
 
  Rick Eastes travels to Chile routinely to arrange for shipping that
  country's seasonal fruits here. It's summer in Chile now, so his Berry
  Sorbet is seasonal, sort of. In it he uses fructose. Not because this
  sugar is more easily digested by some people, but because he had some
  on the shelf the day he ran out of granulated sugar. If you've run
  out of fructose, you can use granulated sugar it its place.
  =======================================================

  * - optional
  =======================================================
  ============== ===
  1. In a 2-3 quart pan, combine the 2 cups of blackberries and
  raspberries, fructose, water, and lime juice. Bring to a boil over
  high heat, stirring often. Then reduce heat and simmer until
  blackberries mash redily, 3-4 minutes. Whirl mixture, a portion at a
  time, in blender or food processor until smoothly pureed. To remove
  seeds, rub puree through a fine strainer into a bowl.
  2. Pour puree into a 9-10" square metal pan. Cover airtight and freeze
  until firm, at least 8 hours or up to 2 weeks.
  3. Frozen sorbet has an icy texture. If you like a softer texture,
  break frozen sorbet into chunks and beat with a mixer until slushy;
  serve at once or return to freezer up to 1 hour. Top servings of
  sorbet with additional berries and liqueur to taste (1-2 tablespoons
  per portion). Makes about 3 cups.

MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
    1/4 c  Butter unsalted
    3/4 c  Crumbs from amaretto cookies
    1/2 c  Pine nuts

MMMMM-----------------------CHEESE FILLING----------------------------
     15 oz Ricotta cheese
    1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Sour cream
      2 tb Four
      2 ts Lemon peel
      2    Eggs
 
  Berries, grapes, or orange garnish.
  
  To make crust, place melted butter in 9 inch pie plate. Stir in cookie
  crumbs and pine nuts until well blended. Press firmly against bottom
  and sides of dish to form crust. Heat until set.
  
  To make filling, combine ricotte cheese, sour cream, sugar, flour,
  lemon peel, and eggs in 8 cup glass measure. Heat until center is
  very warm to the touch, stirring every two minutes. (Microwave is
  easy). Mixture will be a little lumpy at this point but will cook
  into a smooth pie. Pour filling into crust, smoothing it evenly on
  top. Place pie on top of microwave proof cereal bowl and microwave on
  medium for 8 to 14 minutes or until almost set in center, rotating
  one quarter turn once or twice. Let stand directly on counter for 30
  minutes.  Chill for 3 hours or overnight before serving. Garnish pie.
  To test to see if done, touch the top 1 inch from the center with
  your finger. When top adheres to your finger, cheese cake underneath
  should appear to be moist but set, not gooey. Sides should begin to
  pull away from dish.

           Text Only
 
  Unlike most other cheeses, Italian ricotta is comparatively low in
  fat and has only 420 kilojoules per 100 g compared to cream's 1400.
  So this recipe for ricotta cream is an excellent and rich-tasting
  alternative to whipped cream.
  
  Hull 3 punnets of strawberries and put them in 1 large or 6 individual
  dishes.  Put 450 g ricotta cheese in a food processor and add 2 egg
  yolks, 2 tablespoons of rum, the grated zest of a lemon and 3
  tablespoons of honey or sugar.  Process, pour over the strawberries
  and chill until serving.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Jim Vorheis
    1/3 c  Fresh lime juice
           Sea salt to taste
    1/3 c  Finely chopped radishes
    1/4 c  Finely chopped white onion
      1    Chile peron, black seeds
           -removed and roughly

           Or any hot green chile,
           -chopped with seeds
      1 tb Roughly chopped cilantro
           The tacos:
      1 c  Drained and lightly salted
           -ricotta cheese
      6    Thin 5-inch corn tortillas
      6    Toothpicks
           Safflower oil for frying
 
  Have ready a tray lined with a double thickness of paper toweling.
  
  First make the sauce.  Put the lime juice and salt into a glass bowl,
  mix in the rest of the ingredients, and leave for at least 30 minutes
  to marinate.  This should make about 1 cup.
  
  Spread 1 tablespoon of the ricotta over half of each tortilla. Fold
  over and secure with a toothpick.
  
  Put oil to a depth of 1/4 inch in a large frying pan and heat. When
  hot but not smoking, add a few of the tacos and fry, turning once
  until they are a golden color and quite crisp. Continue with the
  rest, adding oil if necessary.
  
  Drain the tacos well on paper toweling and remove as soon as they are
  cool enough to handle.  With a toothpick, ease them open and insert
  about 2 tablespoons of the sauce.  Serve immediately; they cannot
  wait.

 Categories: Breads, Greek
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1 tb Active dry yeast
      1 c  Tepid (110 F) water
      3 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Fine-grain sea salt
      3 c  Whole wheat flour, or more
      2 tb Dried rigani; crumbled
    1/2 tb Dried mint; finely crumbled
    3/4 lb Feta cheese; well drained,
           - finely crumbled
      1    Egg yolk; beaten with:
      2 tb Warm water
 
  Sprinkle the yeast over the water and set aside in a warm place until
  foamy, about 10 minutes.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and
  the salt.
  
  Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the center,
  and pour in the yeast mixture.  Knead 10 minutes, adding additional
  flour if necessary to make a firm elastic dough. Transfer to a
  lightly oiled bowl, tightly cover with plastic wrap, and set aside
  for 2 hours in a warm draft-free spot.
  
  Knead in the rigani, mint, and feta until evenly distributed
  throughout the dough.  Lightly oil a heavy baking sheet and place the
  dough in the center. Form into a round loaf and flatten to a
  thickness of 2 inches. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside
  for 1 hour in a warm draft-free spot. The dough will rise only
  slightly.
  
  Heat the oven to 350 F.
  
  With a sharp thin blade, slash the top of the loaf diagonally in 2 or
  3 parallel lines, brush with the remaining olive oil, and bake 25
  minutes. Brush with the beaten egg yolk and bake 15 minutes longer,
  or until the bread is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped
  on the bottom.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish, Ethnic
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 bn Fresh broccoli; cleaned and
           -cut into bite-sized pieces
    3/8 c  Olive oil
           Salt and pepper to taste
           Vegetable oil
      1 lb Rigatoni; preferably Italian

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    5/8 tb Garlic; coarsely chopped
    3/8 c  Fresh basil; chopped
    1/4 c  Italian parsley; chopped
      1 c  Fresh tomatoes; chopped
    1/8 c  Olive oil
      1 bn Whole scallions; thinly
           -sliced
      3    Ripe tomatoes at room
           -temperature; cut into bite-
           -sized pieces
 
   Boil the broccoli for about 5 mintues, until al dente--do not
  overcook. Drain, place in large bowls and allow to cool. Pour 1/2 of
  the olive oil over the broccoli and add salt and pepper.
  
   Cook pasta in boiling, salted water, with one tbs of vegetable. oil.
  Stir often with a fork or spoon long enough to reach the bottom of
  the pot.
  
   When cooked a little firmer than al dente, drain the pasta well and
  allow to cool in wide serving bowls.
   Pour the rest of the olive oil over the pasta, add salt and pepper
  and mix so that it does not stick.
  
   Make the sauce: blend the garlic, basil, parsley, chopped tomatoes
  and oils in a food processor. When the pasta and broccoli are cool,
  gently mix togehter (it's easier to do with your hands). Add
  scallions and mix with the pasta and broccoli. Add the sauce and
  gently mix. Add 1/2 cup of parsley and the tomatoes.
   Check for salt. Do not refrigerate but serve at room temperature.
  
   The components of this recipe may be made ahead of time--the pasta
  cooked in the morning; and dressed just with the olive oil, the sauce
  made, and the vegetables prepared. It is best to blanch the broccoli,
  however, just a little before mixing together so it keeps its
  freshness.

      Title: RIGATONI WITH CREAMY ARTICHOKE SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 md To large artichokes
      1 tb Flour
      1    Lemon, cut in half
    1/2 md Onion, chopped
      1    Garlic clove, chopped
      2 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Broth chicken
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
           Salt and pepper, to taste
      1 lb Rigatoni, or other medium
           -large tubular pasta
           Freshly grated Parmesan,
           -to taste
 
  Prepare artichokes by bending back the outer leaves until they snap
  off. The edible bit at the end should remain on the heart, which you
  will cook for the sauce, When all the tough leaves have been snapped
  off, and only the tenderest ones remain, trim them with a knife:
  First strip the stem of its tough skin, trim the base, and cut off
  the sharp top of the tender inner leaves. You now have artichoke
  hearts. Cut each heart into quarters and trim the inner choke away,
  then place the quarters in a saucepan with water to cover. Mix in the
  flour and add the lemon halves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook
  a few minutes until artichoke quarters are al dente. Remove from
  heat, drain, discard the lemon and let artichokes cool. (This may be
  done up to 3 days ahead.) Dice artichoke quarters and set aside.
  Lightly saute the onion and garlic in the butter. When softened, add
  the diced artichokes and cook for a few minutes. Add broth and bring
  to a boil; reduce heat and simmer several minutes until artichokes
  are quite tender. Add cream and cook through, until sauce is
  thickened. Season with pepper. Salt is unlikely to be needed because
  both broth and Parmesan are salty. Cook pasta until al dente. Drain
  and toss with sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve immediately.
  Variation: For a lemony, olivey sauce rather than a creamy one, omit
  cream and add 2 to 3 tablespoons chopped parsley, 5 to 10 pitted and
  halved Kalamata olives, and a teaspoon or 2 of capers to the broth,
  along with artichokes. Cook down until reduced by about half, then
  add a squeeze of lemon. Serve on a thin pasta such as spaghetti.
  Serves 4 to 6.

  Ask the grocery butcher to remove fat from the meat and coarsely
  grind the lamb for you. Or, remove the fat and bone and coarsely chop
  the meat in a food processor. Place the plum tomatoes in a bowl and
  break up with a fork until coarsely crushed.
  
  Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the lamb and
  garlic and cook until the meat begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add
  the onion, rosemary and thyme; cook 1 minute. Add the crushed
  tomatoes, wine, nutmeg, cloves and salt and pepper to taste. Heat to
  a boil and reduce the heat to simmering. Cook, uncovered, until the
  lamb is very tender, about 45 minutes. Check the lamb occasionally.
  There should always be enough liquid to cover the meat. If not, add a
  small amount of water.
  
  Prepare pasta according to package directions; drain. Return the
  pasta to the pot. Add the lamb sauce to the pot and cook over low
  heat until heated through, stirring constantly. Stir in half the
  Parmesan cheese. Divide pasta among serving bowls. Sprinkle with
  remaining cheese and serve.
  
  *Note: If using dried rosemary, soften it as follows: Place the
  rosemary in a heatproof bowl and pour about 1 cup boiling water over
  it. Let stand 5 minutes. Drain before using.

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------LIGHT PART------------------------------
      4 c  Sugar
      1    Egg
      1 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Milk
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Flour: enough to make dough
           -easy to handle

MMMMM-------------------------DARK PART------------------------------
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Molasses
    1/2 c  Water
      2 ts Soda
    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Flour: enough to make dough
           -easy to handle
 
  Mix the light and dark parts in separate bowls. Blend the sugar and
  butter for both parts.
  
  For the light part, beat in the egg then alternately add the milk,
  vanilla and baking powder sifted with flour.
  
  For the dark part add to the butter-sugar mixture the molasses, water
  and vanilla alternately with enough flour.
  
  Break off pieces of dough from both dark and light parts, shape them
  into rounds and roll them separately about 1/8 inch thick. Put one on
  top of the other, roll up like a jelly roll and slice off the pieces
  as thinly as you can. Place on greased cookie sheets and bake at
  350'F until done.
  
  This is a cookie with a "laminated dough structure," that is, one
  part is crispy and the other part is chewy. It results from
  differential sugar crystallization. Ordinary sugar is readily
  crystallizable and produces the crisp part of the cookie (the light
  part). Molasses contains invert sugar and is crystallization
  resistant; it produces the crispy, dark part of the cookie.

      Title: RIGHT IN THE OVEN SMOKING
 Categories: Meats, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 tb Liquid smoke
      1    6 qt pan or casserole
           -with tight fitting lid
      1    Steamer or rack that fits
           -inside pan
           Meat or fish to smoke
 
  Now you can have the smoked effect and similar flavor without a fire
  using your oven.  The technique is called oven-smoking and the
  ingredient that makes it possible is "liquid smoke". This preparation
  flavors foods, but it does not preserve them as true smoking-brining
  folled by partial drying does.
  
  The pale liquid, slold in small bottles alongside seasoning sauces in
  the supermarket, is actually made from smoke. As the wood burns, the
  smoke is captured intubes, where it cools and condenses, and then is
  filtered and bottled.  It comes in several flavors.
  
  Oven smoking is actually a combination of baking and steaming. The
  equipment is simple:  a f to 6 quart pan with a tight lid and a rack
  that will fit inside. All you do is pour a small amount of liqid
  smoke in the pan, set foods you want to smoke on the rack, cover and
  bake. As the smoke evaporates it permeates the food. A little goes a
  long way and it tastes stronger when the food is cold.
  
  Oven smoked foods will keep well for a few days.  To store wrap
  securely to prevent smoke flavor from permeating other items in your
  refrigerator.
  
  Here are some foods you can oven smoke:

      Title: RIGO JANCSI~ PART 1 OF 2
 Categories: Desserts, Hungarian
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      2 tb Butter
           Flour or cocoa
      3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
    3/4 c  Butter (unsalted),
           -softened
    1/2 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs, separated
      1 pn Salt
    1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
           -(sifted)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
     10 oz Chocolate (semisweet),
           -chopped or broken
           -into small chunks
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      4 tb Dark rum
      1 ts Vanilla extract

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      7 oz Chocolate (semisweet),
           -broken or chopped
           -into small chunks
      1 c  Sugar, granulated (fine)
    1/3 c  Water
 
  TO MAKE CAKE:   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. With a pastry
  brush or paper towel, coat an 11x17 inch jelly-roll pan with the
  butter. This will seem like a lot; be very generous. Sprinkle the
  flour or cocoa over the butter and shake the pan to coat the butter
  fully. Tap the edge of the pan on a table to knock out the excess
  flour. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or a bowl over a pan of
  simmering water. Set aside to cool to lukewarm.
  
  Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until the whites cling to the
  beater. Add about 1/4 cup of the sugar and beat until the whites form
  stiff, unwavering peaks. Cream the butter and the other (about) 1/4
  cup of the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the
  melted chocolate and beat in the egg yolks one at a time.
  
  With a rubber spatula, stir about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into
  the chocolate mixture, then pour the chocolate mixture over the rest
  of the whites. Sprinkle the flour lightly on top. Gently fold the
  mixture together until no white streaks remain. Pour the batter into
  the prepared pan, spreading it evenly with a rubber spatula. Bake in
  the middle of the oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the cake
  shrinks slightly away from the sides of the pan and a knife inserted
  in the middle comes out clean. It will still be very flat. Loosen the
  cake from the pan with a sharp knife around the sides and turn it out
  onto a rack to cool. (Put the rack over the pan and flip the whole
  thing over to keep the cake from breaking.)
  
  TO MAKE FILLING:  In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the cream and
  chocolate and stir over medium heat until the chocolate dissolves.
  Then reduce the heat to very low and simmer, stirring constantly,
  until the mixture thickens to the consistency of a pudding. Pour it
  into a bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
  
  When the mixture is very cold, pour in the rum and vanilla and beat
  with a whisk or beater until the filling is smooth and creamy and
  forms soft peaks when the beater is lifted. Do not over-beat or you
  will get butter. (If this should happen, don't despair; chocolate
  buttercream makes a perfectly fine filling.)
  
  Cut the cake in half to make two layers, each about 8 1/2 inches wide.
  Spread the filling over one layer and set the other layer on top.
  Smooth out the edges with a spatula. If one of the cake layers should
  break, use it on the bottom. Refrigerate on a rack for about 1 hour.

      Title: RIGO JANCSI~ PART 2 OF 2
 Categories: Desserts, Hungarian
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
           See Part 1
 
  : Continued from Part 1
  
  TO MAKE GLAZE:   In a small, heavy saucepan, heat the sugar, water and
  chocolate over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar and
  chocolate are dissolved. Make sure the sugar is fully dissolved or
  you will get a grainy glaze. Cover the pan and let the glaze cool for
  about 20 minutes.
  
  Set a jelly-roll pan on a table with one short edge propped up. Put
  the rack with the cake on something else so that it is suspended
  level over the pan but offset about 2 inches so that you can reach
  down into the lower pan with a spoon. Hold the pan with the glaze
  about 2 inches over the cake and pour the glaze on the cake. Using a
  large spoon, scoop up the glaze that collects in the jelly-roll pan
  and put it back on the cake. Keep doing this until the glaze begins
  to stop flowing smoothly. You should end up with a thick, even layer
  of glaze on the cake.
  
  Refrigerate the cake until the glaze is firm, 10 to 20 minutes. Serve
  by cutting into 35 small, equal pieces, 5 in each row across and 7 in
  each row down. For cutting, use a sharp knife that has been dipped in
  warm water and wiped off between slices. Keep refrigerated, but for
  maximum flavor, allow to come to room temperature before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Serving these chocolate cream slices will guarantee the success of
  any endeavor.  The name is pronounced, approximately, rrigo yanshi
  (trilled r). This recipe comes from "The Cooking of Vienna's Empire"
  and is, of course, Hungarian.  A friend of mine describes the
  Hungarians as the people who taught the Viennese how to bake. Yield:
  Makes 35.
  
  *  Fine granulated sugar is not the same thing as confectioner's
  sugar. Regular granulated sugar will work ok for the glaze, just make
  sure it is fully dissolved. You can avoid lots of chopping by using
  chocolate chips; one cup of chips equals about 6 oz. chips.
  
  : Difficulty:  Quite difficult.  For experienced dessert cooks only.
  : Time:  several hours.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.
