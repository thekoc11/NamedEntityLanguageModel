  Cook over medium heat, turning often, about 4 min each side until just
  beginning to brown and pieces are no longer pink.
  
  Remove to paper towels and blot to absorb any fat.  Wrap.  Store in

  To serve:  Return sausages or patties to a clean, cold frypan.  Cook over
  medium heat, turning once or twice, about 4 min until sausages are brown
  and crisp.  (Cook frozen sausages in the same manner, allowing about 2 min
  longer for cooking.

  Suggestion for Pork Pies: Stir-cook the ground pork mixture in the frying
  pan, place it in a plastic colander to drain off most of the fat and blot
  with paper towels.  Spread the pork mixture in a baking dish (try 8"
  pyrex), add fat-free gravy if needed for liquid. Top with about 2 1/4 cups
  seasoned breadcrumbs.  Bake at 350-375 F until crumbs are lightly browned.
  
  1/12 recipe = 10 grams carbohydrate, 9 grams protein, 4 grams fat, 113
  calories.  Compare with 1/12 recipe Betty Crocker Pork Pies made with 1 lb
  sausage and 1 c cooked ham, cream of chicken soup, apples, pastry: 19.5 gm
  carbohydrate, 10 gm protein, 15 grams fat, 250 calories.

      Title: Chicken and Dumplings
 Categories: Diabetic, Poultry, Low-cal
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 sm Chicken (1-1/2 lbs)
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/4 t  Salt
    1/2    Stalk Celery
    1/4 c  Onion
           Dumplings, recipe follows
      1 c  All purpose flour
      1 t  Baking powder
    1/2 t  Salt
      1 T  Shortening
    1/2 c  Skim milk
 
   Directions for Chicken and Dumplings: Disjoint chicken and remove skin;
  place in large pan.
   Add water, salt, celery, and onion; simmer 1 to 2 hours or until meat is
  tender.  Remove chicken from bone; return chicken to chicken stock. Bring
  chicken and stock to a boil; add rolled dumplings. Cover and boil gently 8
  to 10 minutes.
  
   Directions for making rolled dumplings: Combine flour, baking powder, and
  salt.  Cut in shortening. Add milk to make a stiff dough. Roll dough out to
  about 1/8 inch thickness and cut into 1 inch strips, squares or diamonds.
  
   Diabetic Exchanges:
    3/4 Cup, may be exchanged for 2 Medium Fat Meat, 1 Starch.
  
   To make a chicken pot pie, put mixture in a deep dish, cover with a rolled
  pastry dough to fit, making several slashes in the top. The top crust would
  add calories to the total. You may add peas, carrots, mushrooms if you
  like.  Those ingredients are not in the original recipe.

      Title: Chicken Gumbo Soup
 Categories: Low-cal, Soups/stews, Vegetables, Diabetic
      Yield: 14 servings
 
--------------------------------INGREDIENTS--------------------------------
      4 c  Chicken Soup Stock
           (try vegetarian chicken)
      8 c  Water
      2 c  Tomatoes,fresh or canned
    1/2 c  Corn, cooked
      1 c  Okra, cut
    1/2 t  Salt, optional
    1/4 c  Onion, diced
    1/4 c  Rice, uncooked

----------------------------------OPTIONAL----------------------------------
      2 c  Shredded cabbage, or
           Yellow Squash, or
           Zucchini, or
           Asparagus, or
           Chinese Napa cabbage, or
           Bok Choy, or
           French Green Beans, or
           Combination of above
 
   Method: Place 4 C of chicken soup stock and 8 C of water in a soup kettle.
  Bring to a boil. While it is boiling vigorously, add the rice slowly, about
  few grains at a time. Then add the remaining ingredients and simmer covered
  until the vegetables are tender.  For a smaller recipe of 7 cups, use
  one-half of the above amounts. A full cup is 25 calories.
  
   DIABETIC EXCHANGE = 1 Vegetable
  
   Add 1 C peeled shrimp or 1 C shredded chicken breast to make it a little
  heartier while adding few calories. (About 35 cal with addition of other
  vegetables)
  
   DIABETIC EXCHANGE = 1 Vegetable and meat exchange, as used.
  
   I have used this recipe since 1961.  It is light, but filling, and has few
  calories, but is very nutritious with the cruciferous vegetables added. It
  is good for a soup and sandwich combination, excellent for a snack anytime.

      2 T  SugarTwin, granulated
      1 t  Sugar
    1/4 c  Toasted dry crumbs

----------------------------INGREDIENTS FOR CAKE----------------------------
      2 c  Sifted all-purpose or cake
           Flour
      3 t  Baking powder
    1/4 t  Salt
      3 T  Soft butter
      1 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Sugartwin, Granulated
      4 dr Yellow food coloring
      1 ea Egg (or substitute)
 
  DIRECTIONS:
  Preheat oven to 375 F.  Grease an 8-inch round cake
  pan.  Combine topping ingredients, stirring until
  blended.  Set aside. Sift flour, baking powder, salt
  and sweetener into small mixer bowl.  Cut in butter on
  low, then medium speed, 3 to 5 minutes, until mixture
  is completely blended, and looks like cornmeal (this
  assures a fine grain). Add 1/2 C milk mixed with food
  coloring.  Beat 1/2 min. on medium speed. (Batter will
  be stiff)  Add remaining milk and beat one minute
  longer. Add unbeaten egg and beat one minute more.
  Pour into pan already prepared; sprinkle with cinnamon
  crumbs.  Bake 20 minutes until cake springs back when
  lightly touched.  Extra crumbs may be added, and  they
  can be prepared from cinnamon raisin bread.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
      3 c  Fresh cranberries (1 12-oz.
      3 c  Water
      1 tb Low-calorie raspberry gelati
      1 x  Artificial sweetener = 1 cup
      1 x  (aspartame or liquid sweeten
      1 x  Blue food coloring (optional
           Personal Note from Ursula
           -Taylor - for diabetic use -
           -use SF gelatin.
 
      In a saucepan, heat the cranberries and water to the simmering point.
  Simmer for 15 minutes, until the berries have burst and the liquid takes on
  a syrup-like consistency. Strain mixture through a sieve; discard berry
  skins.
     To hot liquid, add gelatin, sweetener, and 1 or 2 drops blue food
  coloring, stirring until dissolved.
   Pour into a 3-cup gelatin mold and chill overnight.
     Makes 12 (1/4-cup) servings.  Each serving is 1/4 fruit, approximately
  11 calories.
     NOTE:  The reason for the blue food coloring is that without it, this
  cranberry sauce is very RED.  If you want it to look more like the canned
  stuff (a purplish hue), just add a drop or two of the blue).

  Judi's Notes:  I would bake this meat loaf in a loaf pan due to possible
  grease escaping from the jelly roll pan.  I would also spoon off some of
  the fat from the loaf after 30 minutes.

      Title: Easy Dill Pickles
 Categories: Pickles, Canning, Vegetables, Diabetic
      Yield: 12 pints
 
     48 ea Pickling Cucumbers *
      1 qt Cider Vinegar
      1 c  Pickling Salt
      1 ea Bunch Dill
      8 c  Water
     12 cl Garlic, Peeled
 
   *  Pickling cucumbers are cucumbers that are not less than 3-inches long
  and not more than 4-inches long.
   Wash the cucumbers and remove any stems.  Cover with cold water and
  refrigerate overnight or for several hours. Pack the cucumbers into pint
  jars as tightly as possible. Poke in 2 springs of dill. Bring the cider
  vinegar, water, salt and garlic cloves (12 to 16 cloves depending on your
  taste) to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes. Fish out the garlic cloves with a
  slotted spoon and put one in each jar (or to taste) while the brine cools
  slightly. Pour the hot brine into the jars and seal.
  
   Makes 12 Pints.
     Personal note from Ursula Taylor - when I imported this recipe it called
  for 1 clove of garlic in the ingredients - but directions call for one
  garlic clove to go in each jar - so I adjusted the ingredients to reflect
  this....

  grass and put SF jelly beans and maybe a SF chocolate bunny. Also noticed
  that the crust was very dry so added a little more margarine....

      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Sweetener equiv. to sugar**
      1 ts Artificial brandy extract
 
    Preparation 10 min, standing time 4 hours.
    In small saucepan, combine milk and cocoa.  Whisk until there are no

    Pour into 8 inch square baking dish.  Let stand at room temperature 4
  hours or until firm.
    To remove from pan, cut around edges with a sharp knife. Place dish in
  shallow pan of hot water for about 30 seconds just to slightly soften
  bottom. Loosen one corner, then quickly flip gel out onto clean cutting
  surface.
    With sharp knife, cut evenly in 10 one way and 10 the other way. Place in
  container, cover and refrigerate. Will keep up to 1 week in refrigerator.

 Categories: Diabetic
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 c  Fruit juice
           -you can use one of the
           -following: apple, orange,
           -pineapple, pineapple-orange
           -or grape
           Sweet One if necessary
 
    This was posted on *P by Sherry Eckert - ID# GDDF80A.
   It was posted along with a recipe for Mom's Southern Pecan Pie that she
  got from SWEET INSPIRATIONS SUGAR FREE COOKBOOK.
    To make fruit sweetner, cook the four cups of juice until it is reduced
  to one cup.  If you like it sweeter add Sweet One to taste.
    OR if a recipe calls for 1/2 cup fruit sweetner, use 1/2 cup frozen fruit
  juice plus half as much (1/4 cup) granulated fructose. Sherry adds Sweet
  One instead to desired sweetness. If 2/3 cup is called for in recipe ~ use
  2/3 cup concentrate plus 1/2 cup granulted fructose. Commercial fruit
  sweetners are available at health food stores.

      1 pk Dream Whip

      2    Egg yolks
      2 lg Lemons; 1/2 cup juice
      3    Egg whites
      3 tb Sugar
 
   Melt margarine on medium to low heat.  Roll graham crackers into crumbs
  with rolling pin.  Mix crumbs and melted margarine. Pat to make crust on
  bottom and sides of pie pan. Chill.
  
   Add cold evaporated milk to Dream Whip (do not add vanilla). Sprinkle in
  24 pkg. Equal.  Mix and beat according to directions. Beat egg yolks
  slightly, and gradually stir in lemon juice. Gradually fold in the whipped
  Dream Whip.  Spread in pie crust.  Turn on broiler so it will get hot. Beat
  3 egg whites frothy (use clean beaters so whites will beat up as fluffy as
  possible).  Add 1 tbs. sugar and beat until blended in. Add another tbs.
  sugar and 3 Equal pkg. and beat until soft peaks form. Spread meringue over
  top.
   Spread meringue to stick to the edges so it won't shrink when you broil
  it.
  
   Put under broiler for 30-60 seconds until meringue is lightly browned. IT
  DOESN'T TAKE LONG AT ALL AND IS EASY TO BURN. The flavors will blend better
  if you chill for 5 hours.

    Fresh fruit flavor infuses this interesting salad. Star fruit
  (carambola), a juicy, tart, plum-flavored fruit, looks like a five-pointed
  star when it's sliced crosswise.
    Available from summer's end to midwinter, star fruit has become one of
  our favorite fruits - we love it's exotic flavor, and 1 1/2 star fruits is
  only 1 fruit exchange. Choose firm fruit that has a bright even color.
   Those with greening on the ribs need to be ripened at room temperature.
  Once ripe, refrigerate in a tightly closed plastic baf for up to a week.
    If star fruit is not available, you can substitute orange sections. Small
  inner leaves of crisp romaine can be used instead of Swiss chard.
    Remove chard stems; trim and discard woody bottoms. Coarsely chop stems
  and leaves.  Place in salad bowl along with star fruit, onion, and bell
  pepper.
    In a small bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients. Pour over salad;
  toss.
    Makes 6 servings.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Ground chicken
      1 cn (1 lb) Canned tomatoes
           -undrained
      1 cn (1 lb) No-fat refried beans
      1 pk Taco seasoning mix (or chili

      4 oz Tortilla chips

           Chopped fresh tomatoes OR
           -fresh salsa
           Sliced ripe olives
 
      Thoroughly cook ground chicken in a nonstick frying pan, breaking up
  with a spoon or spatula.  Drain all fat from meat. Add packet of seasoning
  mix and the can of tomatoes, breaking tomatoes up with the spoon.
   Add the can of refried beans and stir to combine well.
   Let simmer for about 5 - 10 minutes for flavors to combine.
      Put 1 oz. of tortilla chips on each of 4 plates.

      Nutritional information figured using the Meal Mate Analysis Program,
  ver. 3.7  Per serving:  calories - 383, protein - 30 gm., carbohydrates -
  44 gm., fat - 12 gm. Diabetic Exchanges: Bread/Starch - 1.3, Meat ~ 2.4,
  Fat - .7, Vegetable - 4.6
      I cannot vouch for how accurate this is figured as some items are not
  listed in the database and I have to figure using substitutes, like
  figuring how many fresh tomatoes to use as there is no listing for canned
  tomatoes.  So, take it with a grain of salt.
      You could further lower the fat content by using the No Oil Tortilla
  Chips which are baked and not fried or you could prepare your own chips by
  cutting corn tortillas into wedges, sprinkling with water, placing on an
  ungreased cookie sheet and baking at 350 degrees F until crisp and dry.
  
      This recipe is a concoction of a friend.  She originally used all the
  good (?) stuff, ground beef, cheddar cheese, refried beans cooked with
  lard, and whole milk sour cream. . She has since seen the error of her
  ways.  <VBG>  It is just as good and a lot healthier. Please do try it and
  give it a fair chance. I think you will like it. (Trish McKenna)

  minutes. Be sure to baste every 10 minutes with the liquid mixture. Test
  birds...if not done....cook until done. **NOTE** I have used this same
  thing on chickens too as well Guinea hens. All came out well as did the
  quail I used it with. Origin: Don Houston's kitchen...circa 1970-something
  
  NANCY O'BRION NOTES:  I included this because IT gave me good practice to
  work a round a ricepe to make it work for ME and MINE!(very big smile) What
  I figure the food exchange by hotkey it (y)ield and then say yes the next
  question( just be sure that you write or remember what the orginally
  serving was in this case it was 4 serving) I would make this about 1 meat
  exchange(depending on what I use of poulty) and 1 fruit (depanding how big
  tangerine because of the orange juice) and 1 fat exchange. Make it work!!!!
  For it it will not be the same old thing!

  9-inch springform pan and the single package of ladyfingers was not
  adequate.  I also did not measure the Cool Whip Lite and so my end product
  was slightly softer than I expected, altho' not too bad. All in all, this
  is a delicious dessert, one well worth the effort be it for yourself or for

      Title: Turkey Jerky
 Categories: Meats, Snacks, Diabetic
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Turkey breast or tenderloins
           ;boned and skinned
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 c  -water
      2 tb Brown sugar; firmly packed
      2 cl Garlic;pressed or minced OR
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 sm Onion; minced OR
    1/4 ts Onion powder
      1 ts Pepper
    1/2 ts Liquid smoke
           Nonstick cooking spray
 
    Rinse meat and pat dry. Pull off and discard any fat and connective
  tissue. To make meat easier to slice, freeze it until it feels firm, but
  not hard. Cut turkey into 1/8 to 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut breast piece
  with or across the grain, and tenderloins lengthwise.
  
    In a bowl, stir together salt, water, brown sugar, garlic, onion, pepper,
  and liquid smoke. Add turkey and mix well. Cover and chill at least 1 hour
  or up to 24 hours; meat will absorb most of the liquid.
  
    Depending on drying method, evenly coat dehydrator racks, (you need 3,
  each about 10 by 13 in.) or metal racks (to cover a 10- by 15-inch baking
  pan) with nonstick cooking spray.
  
    Lift turkey strips from liquid, shaking off excess, and lay strips close
  together, but not overlapping, on racks.
  
    In a dehydrator: Arrange trays as manufacturer directs and dry at 140
  until a cool piece of jerky (remove from dehydrator and let stand about 5
  minutes) cracks and breaks when bent, about 4 1/2 to 5 hours.
  
    In an oven: Set at 150-200, place pan on center rack; prop door open
  about 2 inches. Dry until a piece of jerky cracks and breaks when bent (see
  above), about 3-5 hours.
  
    Let jerky cool on racks, then remove. Serve or store in airtight con-
  tainers in a cool, dry place up to 3 weeks, in the refrigerator up to 4
  months, or longer in the freezer. Makes about 7 ounces.
  
   TERIYAKI TURKEY JERKY: Prepare turkey jerky as above, omitting salt and
  water. Add 1/4 cup soy sauce and 2 teaspoons Worcestershire.

      1 ds Hot pepper sauce;
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  My note: Remove bones from turkey or chicken before serving and refrigerate
  or freeze until you have time to prepare the soup. I like to do it the next
  day, if possible, and make a batch of crackers while the soup is cooking.
  
  STOCK: In stockpot or large saucepan, combine bones, water, bay leaf,
  celery and onion. (Skin and drippings may be included, if desired.) Simmer,
  covered about 4 hours. Strain, reserving stock. Let bones cool, pick out
  any meat and add to the stock.
  
  SOUP: In stockpot or saucepan, bring stock to boil; add noodles and simmer
  for 5 minutes. Add celery, carrot, green onions, zucchini, basil and thyme.
  Simmer for 10 minutes.  Stir in hot pepper sauce, season with salt and
  pepper to taste.  Makes about 4 1/2 cups.

      1 sl Raisin bread;crumbed
    1/3 c  Nonfat dry milk powder
      4 pk Artificial sweetner
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
    1/8 ts Nutmeg

     Formatted into MM by Ursula R. Taylor.
     Make raisin bread into crumbs.  Combine all dry ingredients into large
  bowl.  In small bowl combine all wet ingredients and mix well. Add to dry
  ingredients and stir until thoroughly combined. Spray loaf pan (7 3/8 x 3
  5/8 x 2 1/4) with PAM. Bake at 375 for 12 to 15 minutes or until done and
  toothpick comes out clean. Makes 1 serving equal to 1 bread, 1 egg, 1 milk
  and 1 limited vegetable. You can make 4 at a time by quadrupling list of
  ingredients and baking in a jelly roll pan. Egg beaters can be used instead
  of egg.
     This is an old Weight Watchers Receipe.
     If making 4 - use a jelly roll pan - cook for about 17 minutes or until
  done and using a toothpick to see if done. If done the toothpick comes out
  clean. Then cut into 4 equal servings and put them in individual plastic
  baggies.
     1 - 16 oz. can of pumpkin will make two batches of 4 each of these....So
  it's just as easy to make 8 at once. Then freeze four of them..Reheat in
  the microwave....
