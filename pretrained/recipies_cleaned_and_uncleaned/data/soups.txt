Blackeyed Peas & Rice

low fat, rice, stews, vegetarian

1/2  onion
1 single lipton rice 'n' sauce cajun
1 tablespoon pepper
1 single stew meat
1 teaspoon creole or cajun seasoning
1 single bell pepper

Cayenne pepper or hot sauce

Look thru peas for rocks and wash through 3 waters. Soak peas in water
overnight in fridge.  The next day, throw out water they soaked in;
some claim this keeps beans from giving you a problem, but stay on
this diet a couple weeks and you won't have a problem anyway. It goes
away. Wash stew meat and put stew meat and pre-soaked peas in big pot
on stove and bring to boil, with PLENTY of water. Add seasonings to
taste. If you use Cajun seasoning it contains salt; so don't add
extra salt!!!! Otherwise, add salt to taste.  When stew meat and peas
come to a boil, reduce to Medium and keep watching to add water so
they don't scorch. After about 40 minutes add packet of Rice and
Sauce, preferably Cajun flavor. Start watching the water really
carefully now, and add a pint from time to time. After about 20
minutes of rice cooking, add bell pepper, onion, and more seasonings
if you need.  (This dish is good hot and peppery) Everything should
be ready at the same time. When test bite shows all is ready, eat!

Curried Squash & Mushroom Soup

soups, low fat, vegetarian

2 medium butternut squash, or acorn squash
2 1/2 cup water
1 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon butter, or oil
1 cup onion, chopped
2  cloves garlic, crushed
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon coriander
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 lb mushroom, sliced
1 dash cayenne, to taste
1  lemon juice, fresh
1  yogurt, for the top

1. Preheat oven to 375F Split the squash lenghwise, remove seeds, and
place face-down on a lightly oiled tray. Bake until soft (about 30 to
40 minutes.) Cool, then scoop out the insides. Measure out 3
cups'-worth place this in a food processor or blender with the water,
and puree until smooth. (You may need to do this in batches.)
Transfer to a kettle and stir in the orange juice.

2. Heat the butter or oil in a skillet, and add onion, garlic, salt,
and spices. Saute over medium heat until the onion is very soft -
about 8 minutes. (You may need to add a small amount of water to
prevent sticking.) Add mushrooms, cover, and cook about 10 minutes
over medium heat, stirring occasionally.

3. Add the saute to the squash, scraping the skillet well to salvage
all the good stuff. Add cayenne and heat gently. Once it is hot,
taste it to correct the seasonings. This is a fairly sweet soup; you
may choose to adjust this by adding the fresh lemon juice ..to taste
and topping each bowlful with a small spoonful of yogurt. Recipe by:

Diet Cream Soup Base

crockpot, diabetic, soups/stews, allergy, low-fat/cal

1  white sauce
3 1/2 tablespoon instant milk powder
1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/4 cup cold water
1  tomato
8 oz can tomato sauce
3 tablespoon chopped onion
1 pinch dry rosemary, crumbled
1 pinch fresh ground pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper

This recipe is suitable for anyone who needs to know the exact
contents of soup. OTHER OPTIONS: Regular recipes use about 1 1/2 Tb
butter and 1 1/2 Tb flour per cup of milk for a medium white sauce.

5 oz evaporated milk plus 5 oz water plus 1 Tb corn starch

1 cup soy milk plus 1 Tb corn starch

1 cup skim milk plus 1 Tb vegetable oil plus 1 Tb corn starch

Put ingredients in a blender and process at high speed until well
blended, or put ingredients in a jar and shake, or stir dry
ingredients into cold milk with a whisk.

Stir constantly in the top of a double boiler until the sauce
thickens and simmers, then cook ten minutes. A medium saucepan set in
a larger saucepan of simmering water works, too.

Fresh tomatoes may be cooked with onion and seasoning, allowed to
cool and pureed in a blender to make the sauce. If the tomato mixture
is colder, add a little of the hot white sauce to bring it to the
same temperature. This prevents curdling when the red mixture is
gradually added back into the pot with the white sauce.

Heat soup until it is hot enough to serve but do not allow it to boil.

The same method may be used with 3/4 to 1 cup of cooked diced (or
pureed) vegetables with cooking liquid used to make the sauce. Makes
about 2 cups. Suggested vegetables:  potato with a little onion,
carrot, zucchini, cabbage with a little ham, sauteed onion, mushroom,
broccoli. Season to taste.

Tested Dec 93 using powdered milk, and (thawed) canned tomato by
Elizabeth Rodier.  This was a successful experiment based on a

Diet Shrimp Bisque

low cal, low fat, kump, seafood

2 lb fresh shrimp; -=or=- scampi, lobster or
1 tablespoon safflower; -=or=- virgin olive oil
1  leek  cleaned & sliced coarsely
1 small carrot; peeled and sliced
1  celery stalk; sliced
2  shallots; peeled and chopped
1  garlic clove  peeled & minced
1 tablespoon tomato puree
1 1/2 cup dry white wine
2 quart water
1  chicken bouillon cube  crushed
1 pinch saffron
      ----HERB BOUQUET----
1/2 teaspoon thyme; and
1/2  bay leaf, and
6  fresh parsley stems (tied in cheese; cloth)
      ----FOR THE BISQUE----
1  salt and pepper to taste
4 tablespoon cornstarch
4 tablespoon non-fat powdered milk
1/2 teaspoon cognac, armagnac or brandy
4  basil leaves; minced
1 teaspoon tarragon, minced
1 tablespoon minced chives

SEPARATE THE TAIL from the shrimp and remove the meat, reserving all
shells, claws, heads and so forth. If you wish, devein the tails, then
cover and refrigerate. Coarsely chop the heads and shells, reserving 4
heads for decoration, if you have them. In a large saucepan, heat the
oil over moderate heat, then add the shrimp shells and cook them.
Stir slowly but continuously for 5 minutes. Add the vegetables and
tomato puree and cook another 5 minutes, stirring. Add the wine and
bring to the boil for 30 seconds, scraping the bottom to dissolve any
coagulated juices. Add the water, bouillon cube, saffron and herb
bouquet. Return to a simmer and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Pour the
stock through a fine strainer into a bowl, pressing down on the
vegetables and shrimp shells with a soup ladle to extract all of the
liquid. (For a finer result, strain again through cheesecloth.)
Return the stock to the boil. Moisten the cornstarch in a little cold
water, then add it to the saucepan and boil for 4 minutes. Taste for
salt and pepper. (The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point and
refrigerated.) Bring the stock to a simmer. Add the shrimp tails and
let them cook a bare 2 minutes (for small or medium), or 3 minutes
for extra large. Remove immediately with a slotted spoon and divide
them among 4 heated soup plates. Pour the stock into a blender, add
the powdered milk and cognac. Blend until smooth and homogeneous.
Pour immediately into the soup plates over the shrimp tails. Garnish
each dish with an equal amount of the herbs and a shrimp head
(optional).

This rich-tasting bisque has only 90 calories per serving.

Dry Cream Soup Mix

soups, low fat, newspaper, diabetic

1 cup nonfat dry powdered milk
1 tablespoon dried onion flakes
2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoon chicken bouillon powder
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Mix all the ingredients together.  Keep this calorie-saving mixture
in an airtight container until you are ready to make a cream soup.
The base can be used to make any flavor you want just by adding the
main flavoring ingredient. For cream of mushroom soup, you would add
fresh or canned mushrooms; for cream of celery soup, add some fresh,
chopped celery, etc. Just add 2 cups of cold water to the magic
mixture and put into a large saucepan.  Over medium heat, cook the
mixture, stirring constantly, until thickened.  Add the main
ingredient and heat for a few more minutes. If it's a little too
thick, just add water to thin it or if it's too thin, add a
tablespoon or two of dry milk powder.

Faux-Fresh Tomato Soup

soups, low cal

1  from: gaye levy
1  onion; medium, chopped
1  carrot; large, chopped
4 cup chicken broth; reg strength
1 can tomato puree; 15 oz.
3 tablespoon basil leaves; dried
3/4 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
2 teaspoon vegetable oil; optional

Spray the bottom of a 3 to 4 quart pan with PAM, or optionally, coat
with oil. Add the onion and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally,
until both the onion and the carrot are sweet tasting and tender when
pierced. This will take about 30 minutes. Stir broth, tomato
puree, basil sugar and pepper into pan. Bring to a boil on high heat.
Cover and simmer to blend flavors, about 15 minutes.  With a
slotted spoon, scoop vegetables and a little of the broth into a food
processor or blender. Whirl until smoothly pureed. Pour vegetable
mixture back into the pan; heat until steaming. Ladle into bowls and
enjoy.

Notes from Gaye: This recipe is adapted from Sunset
Magazine, circa 1987. What could be more filling (and warming) this
time of year than a large bowl of soup and some fresh bread? For the
bread, try the Italian Bread which is as lo-cal as bread can go...and
go easy on the butter or margarine.

Hearty Bean & Vegetable Stew

low fat, stews, vegetarian, crockpot, ornish

1 lb beans, assorted, dry
2 cup vegetable juice
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup apple or pineapple juice vegetable; stock or water
1/2 cup celery  diced
1/2 cup parsnips  diced
1/2 cup carrots  diced
1/2 cup mushrooms  diced
1  onion  diced
1 teaspoon basil, dried
1 teaspoon parsley, dried
1  bay leaf
3  clove garlic  minced
1 teaspoon black pepper  ground
1 cup rice or pasta  cooked

Sort and rinse beans, then soak overnight in water.

Drain beans and place in crockpot.  Add vegetable juice, wine, soy
sauce, and apple or pineapple juice.  Cover with vegetable stock or
water; the amount added depends on whether you prefer a soup (more
liquid) or a stew (less).  The juice adds just a tad of sweetness and
the soy sauce adds depth and the tang of salt.

Cook at high for 2 hours.  Add vegetables, herbs, and spices, and
cook for 5-6 hours at low until carrots and parsnips are tender.
When tender, add rice or pasta and cook for one additional hour.

Notes:

For beans use 3 or 4 kinds, such as: black, red kidney, pinto, baby
lima, lentil, and green and/or yellow split peas.

Most soups and stews can be prepared in a
crock pot.  Just decrease the liquid ingredients (not as much liquid
will evaporate from a closed slowcooker) and let it rip for 6 or more
hours.

Old Fasioned Beef Stew

main dish, meats, low cal, stews

1 lb beef chuck trimmed,cubed 1
2 tablespoon flour, all purpose
2 teaspoon vegetable oil
3 large onions, yellow, thin sliced*
2 cup mushrooms, sliced
2  garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoon tomato paste, reduced sodium
2 cup beef broth, reduced sodium
4 cup carrots, sliced
2 medium russet potatoes, thin sliced
1 cup green bean pieces, 1 inch
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water, cold
1/4 cup parsley, chopped, fresh

* about 3 cups
** about 2 cups

Coat beef with flour, shaking off excess.  In a large nonstick pot,
heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add beef; saute until browned, about
6 minutes.  Place on a plate.

Add onions and mushrooms to pot; saute for 6 minutes.  Add garlic;
saute, stirring for 1 minute.  Pour off fat. Return beef to pot, stir
in tomato paste, then broth.  Add enough water to just cover; bring
to boil.  Reduce heat to low, simmer until beef is tender, about 1
1/4 hours.  Skim off any foam.

Add carrots, potatoes and green beans.  Cover partially and simmer 15
minutes.

In a small bowl mix cornstarch and cold water; stir in stew.  Increase
heat and boil uncovered 1 minute.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

TIPS:

Browning beef before simmering it in stew produces juicy, extra
flavourful meat.  Pat the meat dry with paper towels before adding it
to the hot pan.

When sauteing onion and garlic, saute the onion first.  Onion needs a
longer cooking time and garlic may burn if cooked too long at high
heat.

Pecan Soup

low cal, kump, nuts

6 oz pecans
4 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 large garlic clove
:  salt & freshly ground pepper

This is a wonderful fall soup, and only 200 calories per serving.
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. ON a baking sheet, toast the pecans for 10-to-15
minutes, checking from time to time to prevent burning. Toss
occasionally. In a food processor, place the pecans, garlic and about
1/2 cup of the stock. Turn the processor on and, with the motor
running, add stock until you have a creamy consistency. (The mixture
will absorb the stock.) Pass the pecan-stock mixture through a sieve
into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the cream, season to taste
with salt and pepper and serve. PETER KUMP - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS

Sour Cream & Wild Rice Soup

low fat

      ----POACHING INGREDIENTS----
2  chicken breasts; excess fat and skin remov
1 quart water
1  onion; quartered
1  carrot; cut in large chunks
1  celery rib; cut in half
1  bay leaf
10  black peppercorns; whole
1  salt to taste
      ----SOUP INGREDIENTS----
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 large red onion; thinly sliced
2 medium celery ribs; thinly sliced
3 large carrots; peeled and shredded
4  garlic cloves; chopped
2 cup mushrooms; sliced
1/4 cup flour
1  salt
1  black pepper; freshly ground
1 cup evaporated skim milk
1 cup sour cream substitute
1 tablespoon corn starch
2 cup wild rice; cooked according to packa
3 tablespoon thyme; fresh chopped

In a heavy saucepan, combine the chicken and water, bring to a boil,
reduce the heat to low and carefully skim off any scum. Add onion,
carrot, celery, bay leaf, peppercorns, and salt. Cover and simmer the
chicken for 45 minutes to one hour. Remove the chicken from the broth
and set aside to cool. Strain the remaining broth, discarding the
solids, and place in the refrigerator to chill, or use fat separator
to remove all fat from broth. When the chicken is cool enough to
handle, remove the meat from the bone and tear or shred into bite
sized pieces. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat the olive oil until sizzling,
add the onions, celery, carrots and garlic and cook over medium high
heat for about 5 minutes. Lower the heat to medium, add the mushrooms
and cook for 5 minutes more. Add the flour, salt and pepper and stir
to combine, cooking for 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock (remove the
fat that has accumulated at the top of the stock) and the evaporated
skim milk. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and the
cornstarch. Add to the soup, stirring until thickened and heated
through. Add the cooked rice, shredded chicken and thyme, stirring
until thick and bubbly. Serve at once.

Speedy Gazpacho

vegetables, low cal, soup/stew

      ----BDGM08B----
32 oz v-8 juice
1  green peper, seeded/chopped
1 teaspoon instant beef bouillon
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon onion salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1  cucumber, seeded/chopped
3  stalks celery, seed/chopped
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup curried mayo or sour cream

While this is low-cal, those of you in sunnier climates may find
this great recipe easier to enjoy these days...but I still like it
after (if and when) I come back from the health club, which I promise
to do much more often, starting next Monday! Whilrl all ingredients
in a blender of food processor ~ I like to keep them a little
"chunky", but adjust to your personal preference.  You may need to
process two batches to avoid overflow.   Pour mixture into large
pitcher; refrigerate, or add 6-7 ice cubes to hasten chilling. Serve
with a dollop of curried mayonnaise or sour cream, if your calorie
counter can handle it!

Vegetable Soup With Goulash Taste

soups, vegetables, low cal

6 deciliter water
150 gm yellow onion; chopped
150 gm turnip; cut in small cubes
200 gm squash; cut in small cubes
200 gm carrot; shredded
50 gm tomato; cut in small pieces
4 deciliter tomato juice
2 deciliter water
2  meat extract cubes; should be enough to make
1  salt
1  white pepper
1  basil; *

* Use wathever you like from spices and herbs. I usually add some
"taco table spicemix", some oregano and some black pepper.

Bring the water to a boil together with the meat extract cubes. Add
vegetables and tomato juice. Add more water, put the water into the
tomato juice packet and shake so you get all of the juice out of it.
Let simmer until everything get really mixed and you can't really see
what is what. Mix a little water with flour, add, stir well and let
boil for a couple of minutes.

These are pretty large servings, and noone has to be hungry after
eating... You can replace almost all the vegetables with something
else, it should be a total of about 800 g vegetables, that's the main
"rule" in this recipe...

If you are a Weight Watcher one portion will take about 10 extra
calories from your weekly amount of extra calories , NOTHING ELSE...
guess if I love this recipe!
