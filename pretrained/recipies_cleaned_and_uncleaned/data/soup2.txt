Mole Poblano Picante

mexican, poultry, soup/stew, chocolate

8  mulato chiles
4  ancho chiles
4  pasilla chiles
8 lb turkey, in pieces
4 tablespoon lard
4 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 large onion, chopped
2  cloves garlic, chopped
1  tortilla, cut up
1 cup blanched almonds
1/8 teaspoon ground gloves
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seed
1/4 teaspoon anise
1/2 cup raisins
3  tomatoes, seeded, chopped
4  canned chipotle chiles
2 oz unsweetened chocolate
1  salt
1  freshly ground pepper
1 teaspoon sugar

Prepare the mulato, ancho, and pasilla chiles by washing in cold
water; removing veins, stems, and seeds; and tearing them roughly
into pieces. Place the pieces in a bowl and soak in hot water (about
1 cup to 6 chiles) for about an hour. Blend the chiles with the
soaking water in a blender, but do not over blend. The texture should
remain coarse.

Place the turkey pieces in a flameproof casserole with a lid, and
poach, covered, in salted water to barely cover for 1 hour. Drain,
reserving the stock. Dry the turkey pieces thoroughly with paper
towels. Heat the lard in a skillet, and brown the turkey pieces, a
few at a time. Arrange the turkey pieces in the casserole and keep
warm. Combine 2 tbs of the sesame seeds, the onion, garlic, tortilla,
almonds, cloves, cinnamon, coriander seed, anise, raisins, tomatoes,
prepared chiles, and chipotle chiles, and reduce, bit by bit, to a
coarse puree in the electric blender.

Heat the remaining lard in a skillet, adding, if necessary, a little
more lard to bring it up to 3 TBS. Cook the puree, stirring
constantly, for about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of the turkey stock,
chocolate, salt and pepper to taste, and the sugar, and cook, over
very low heat, until the chocolate has melted. Pour the sauce over
the turkey; cover; and cook over the lowest possible heat for 1 hour,
stirring occasionally. The sauce should be rather thicker than the
consistency of heavy cream. If it seems too thin, thin with turkey
stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just before serving.

NOTE: Chipotle chile and its close relative morita chile have the most
exotic flavor of any of the Mexican chiles. They are also exceedingly
picante and can really lift your head off. If you do not care for hot
food, experiment with the chipotle, for even in a small quantity its
flavor will survive. Begin with a half chile, tasting and adding more
to your mole with caution until you find the amount that suits your
taste.

Monterey Clam Chowder

crockpot, soups

1  carrot, diced (1)
1 medium onion, diced (1 1/2)
1  potato, diced (2)
1  stalk of celery, diced (2)
1/2 lb minced bacon (3/4 lb.)
1/4 lb margarine (i used butter, 1 1/2 cub; es)
3  cloves fresh garlic, minced (5)
1/2 quart clam juice (i used 3- 8 oz bottles)
1 1/2 cup flour (2 1/4 c.)
2 cup milk (3 c.)
2 cup heavy whipping cream (3 c.)
2 cup half-and-half (3 c.)
1/2 teaspoon black pepper (1 tsp., don't salt!)
1/2 lb chopped clams (fresh, frozen or can; ned) (3 lb. can)
1/2 teaspoon clam base (optional, available in m; ost gourmet shops)

(I made 1 1/2 times this amount - see parenthesis for amt.)

Place vegetables, bacon and margarine in a 5 quart sauce pot. Saute
over medium heat until vegetables are tender. Be careful not to brown
or scorch.

When vegetables are tender, add flour to make a roux. Cook for two
minutes, allowing flour to cook while stirring occasionally.

Add clam juice and dairy products.  Stir by using a wire whip.

Add fresh garlic, black pepper, chopped clams and clam base. Cook over
low-medium heat stirring occasionally to prevent chowder from
scorching. Cook for two hours or until chowder is brought to desired
thickness.

If a crockpot, or small steam kettle is available, it is recommended.
Also, clam juice can be added to thin chowder down if it gets too
thick.

Note:  This soup is the BEST clam chowder I have ever tasted! It is
thick and very rich and fattening! I didn't use the clam base since I
don't even know what that is. Also, I didn't need to simmer it as
long as suggested. I cooked it for about 1 1/2 hours. The chowder
needs to be stirred OFTEN, probably about every 5-10 minutes or so or
it will stick to the bottom of the pot.  Also, I one-and-one-halved
times'd it, using about 3 lbs. of chopped clams instead of the
recommended amount. I also served it with the little soup "clam"
crackers. It made about 5 quarts this way. Deb C.

cyberealm, nets

2 1/2 cup raw kidney beans
6 cup + water
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup tomato juice
1 cup raw bulghar
1  olive oil for saute
4  cloves crushed garlic

3 teaspoon tomato paste
3 teaspoon dry red wine
1  cheese
1  parsley

Put kidney beans in a saucepan and cover them with 6 cups of water.
Soak 3 4 hours.  Add extra water and salt.  Cook until tender (about
1 hour). Watch the water level, and add more if necessary.

Heat tomato juice to a boil.  Pour over raw bulghar.  Cover and let
stand at least 15 minutes.  (It will be crunchy, so it can absorb
more later.) Saute onions and garlic in olive oil.  Add carrots,
celery and spices. When vegetables are almost done, add peppers. Cook
until tender. Combine beans, bulghar, sauted vegetables, tomatoes,
lemon juice, tomato paste, and wine and heat together gently, either

6  tomatoes,large,fresh,chopped
1 tablespoon worchestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon mustard,dry
1  salt
1  pepper

1. Grind ham and chicken, a little at a time, with just enough tomato
juice to keep mixture from clogging blender, or put meats through
medium blade of meat grinder without tomato juice. Set aside.
2. Fry bacon in a large, heavy skillet over low heat until crisp.
Remove bacon, drain, and crumble. Set aside.
3. In bacon fat in skillet, cook onion until soft. Add tomatoes and
ground ham and chicken. Cook until tomatoes are very soft. Stir in
seasonings and crumbled bacon. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Serves 8-10 with barbecued meat; 6 as shortcake.
NOTE: Mrs. Neal Leuty, one of Plains' best cooks, serves this unusual
and unusually good stew in two ways; as an accompaniment to barbecued
fresh pork or chicken along with potato salad, or served with corn
bread squares, split and toasted, as a main course shortcake. Believe
me - and you will when you try it - this is positively scrumptious
served either way.

Navy Bean Soup

soups

2 cup navy beans
3 quart water; cold
1  meaty ham bone or
1  small shank end of ham
1  large onion; minced
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2  celery stalks; minced
1  milk or water
1  salt and pepper

Quick-cooking dried beans do not REQUIRE overnight soaking.  Some
people however, believe even those are better for soaking.  Others
prefer the old-fashioned type. If you prefer to soak beans, measure
the amount of water specified in this recipe and leave beans in it
overnight. Next morning, add the remaining ingredients.  No draining
is necessary. 2 cups beans = 1 lb.

Place beans and water in kettle with ham bone.  Add onion, sugar and
celery.  Bring slowly to boiling point.  Cover and simmer 4 to 5 hours
until beans are tender and the liquid partially cooked down.  Remove
ham bone.
For smooth soup, rub through a coarse sieve.  Or mash beans lightly
with a potato masher for a chunkier soup.  If you prefer, you may
leave beans whole.
Cut ham off bone; add ham to soup.  Season to taste.  Dilute if
desired with additional milk or water.  Serve hot.

Neapolitan Mushroom Soup

italian, vegetables

1 oz dried porcini mushrooms
3 tablespoon unsalted butter
3 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 small onion, minced
3  cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 lb fresh mushrooms, wiped clean, stems; trimmed,
1  and sliced
4  fresh plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded; and chopped
1  or 4 canned italian plum tomatoes,; drained and
1  chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon minced fresh marjoram or 1 teaspoon; dried
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dr; ied
5 cup meat broth
8 slice italian bread, 1/2 inch thick
3  egg yolks
1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
2 tablespoon grated pecorino romano cheese
3 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, plus about 1; /4 cup chopped

for garnish

Soak the porcini mushrooms in 1/2 cup of warm water for about 30
minutes. Drain, reserving the liquid.  Rinse, dry, and chop the
porcini mushrooms. Strain the soaking liquid through washed
cheesecloth, paper towels, or a coffee filter.  Set aside.

Melt the butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot over low
heat. Add the onion and garlic.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the
onion is wilted but not browned, about 5 minutes.

Add the porcini mushrooms and cook for 8 minutes.  Increase the heat
to medium and add the fresh mushrooms.  Cook until the juices run,
about 10 minutes.  Add the reserved porcini soaking liquid and
continue to cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Add the
tomatoes, salt, pepper, marjoram, and thyme; cook for 5 minutes.  Add
the broth and simmer for 15 minutes.

While the soup is cooking, toast the bread in a 400 F oven until
lightly browned on both sides.  Remove and brush one side with the
remaining olive oil.  Use more oil if necessary.

In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks with the Parmesan chese, the
pecorino romano cheese, and 3 tablespoons of chopped parsley.
Gradually whisk 1 cup of the hot soup into the egg yolks to warm
them. Reverse and slowly whisk the egg yolk mixture into the soup.
Cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until the soup
thickens. (Do not boil or the soup will curdle.)

Place a piece of toast in each of 8 bowls.  Ladle in the hot soup and
sprinkle with additonal grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley.

Serves 8.

New Corn Chowder, Southern Style

main dish, rr, vegetables

4  sprigs parsley
1  leek
1/2  carrot; cut lengthwise
1  stalk celery; chopped
1/4  bay leaf
1 pinch sage
1 pinch thyme
2  thick slices bacon, diced
1 cup new corn pulp
1/2 cup onion; chopped fine
1/2 cup celery; chopped fine
4 cup chicken broth
3/4 cup raw potatoes; diced
1 1/2 cup tomatoes; peeled & chopped
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon cornstarch

"The key to this delicious soup is to gently scrape the kernels off
the corn cob with a table fork so the skins remain on the cob,
leaving you with only the fresh pulp."

Use a 12" square of cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni of the
first 7 ingredients and set aside.  In a large saucepan over medium
heat, first soften the bacon, then add the corn, onions, and celery
and saute until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the chicken broth,
potatoes, tomatoes, and the bouquet garni. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat and slow boil for 1 hour. Remove the bouquet garni.  Add the
cayenne pepper.  Meanwhile, using your fingers, dissolve the
cornstarch in heavy cream at room temperature.  Add cornstarch/cream
mixture to soup and stir until heated through.

This recipe comes from the A. T. &  S. F.  RR.

Old Fasioned Beef Stew

low cal, main dish, meats, stews

1 lb beef chuck trimmed,cubed 1
2 tablespoon flour, all purpose
2 teaspoon vegetable oil
3 large onions, yellow, thin sliced*
2 cup mushrooms, sliced
2  garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoon tomato paste, reduced sodium
2 cup beef broth, reduced sodium
4 cup carrots, sliced
2 medium russet potatoes, thin sliced
1 cup green bean pieces, 1 inch
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water, cold
1/4 cup parsley, chopped, fresh

* about 3 cups
** about 2 cups

Coat beef with flour, shaking off excess.  In a large nonstick pot,
heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add beef; saute until browned, about
6 minutes.  Place on a plate.

Add onions and mushrooms to pot; saute for 6 minutes.  Add garlic;
saute, stirring for 1 minute.  Pour off fat. Return beef to pot, stir
in tomato paste, then broth.  Add enough water to just cover; bring
to boil.  Reduce heat to low, simmer until beef is tender, about 1
1/4 hours.  Skim off any foam.

Add carrots, potatoes and green beans.  Cover partially and simmer 15
minutes.

In a small bowl mix cornstarch and cold water; stir in stew.  Increase
heat and boil uncovered 1 minute.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

TIPS:

Browning beef before simmering it in stew produces juicy, extra
flavourful meat.  Pat the meat dry with paper towels before adding it
to the hot pan.

When sauteing onion and garlic, saute the onion first.  Onion needs a
longer cooking time and garlic may burn if cooked too long at high
heat.

*TIP  In high-altitude areas, food may cook slower, even though  * *
it may boil vigorousl y.  For liquid mixtures such as soups,  * * you
may need a larger container; also remove the cover if  * * it's
boiling too hard. To compensate for low boiling temp-  * * eratures,
increase the power level by one level or lengthen  * * cooking time.
Liquids also tend to evaporate faster at high * * altitudes, so you

Onion Soup With Gorgonzola Toast

soups

1  stephen ceideburg
3 large onions, chopped
4  garlic cloves minced
3 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon flour
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
7 cup rich beef stock
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1  salt and pepper to taste
2 oz gorgonzola
4 slice french bread, toasted

Onion soup is a classic example of caramelization as a flavour
enhancer. This soup gets an added flavor boost from the garnish--a
slice of gorgonzola topped bread.

Cook onions and garlic in a large, heavy, covered soup pot over
moderate heat until they release their moisture, about 10 minutes.
Add butter and cook uncovered, until onions are a rich golden brown,
about 15 minutes. Add flour and thyme and cook 5 minutes longer,
stirring constantly. Add stock and tomato paste. Simmer for 15
minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Place a 1/2-ounce slice of Gorgonzola on each piece of toast and run
under the broiler for 1 minute, or until the cheese is bubbly. Ladle
soup into warmed bowls and float a gorgonzola toast on top of each.

Optional.  Place 1/2 cup of the vegetable stock in a Dutch oven or 3
1/2 - 5 qt saucepan and bring to a boil. Add onion, garlic, and
gignger; simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in remaining stock and soy sauce.
Cover pot and bring to a gentle boil. Add remaining ingredients.  Test

crisp/tender. Timing - about 8 minutes. Top each serving with one of
the garnishes. VARIATIONS: - substitute 1 c cooked brown rice for the

root, shredded spinach, chopped celery, or bamboo shoots. EGG THREADS:
In a small skillet, heat a little margarine. When it begins to
bubble, add 1 egg beaten with a little cold water. Tilt the pan so the

the egg is lightly cooked, turn it out onto a cutting board. Slice it
into very thin strips with a sharp knife. (makes about 1/3 cup)

Oven-Baked Beef Stew

stews

4 lb sirloin, cut in 1x2 cubes
2 cup pinot noir or other hearty red wine
1/2 lb thickly sliced bacon, cut in 1/2 pi; eces
2 tablespoon olive oil
2 large onion, chopped
2  carrots, scraped and sliced thin
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
4 cup chicken broth
2 large garlic cloves, sliced thin
2 teaspoon tomato paste
1 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon pepper, or to taste

Pour the wine over the beef in a glass or ceramic bowl (metal will
give the wine an "off" taste). Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours to
marinate.

Reserving the marinade, drain the beef. Dry on paper towels. Simmer
the bacon for 10 minutes in enough water to cover. Drain and pat dry.
(This rids the bacon of smokiness and some fat.) In a dutch oven,
saute the bacon in olive oil over medium heat until crisp. Drain on
paper towels. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the drippings.

Working in small batches so the meat browns well, brown the beef
cubes in the bacon drippings. With a slotted spoon, remove each batch
to a bowl.

Saute the onions and carrots in the drippings until wilted and
beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to
the bowl of meat.

Heat 3 cups of broth in a saucepan. Pour out any drippings that
remain in the Dutch oven. melt the butter over medium heat in the
Dutch oven, then stir in the flour. Scrape the bottom of the pan with
a wooden spatula to keep the mixture moving. When the paste is a dark
golden brown, stir in the broth. Simmer a minute or two, then stir in
the tomato paste, salt, pepper and garlic. Add the sauteed vegetables
and meat. Stir in the reserved wine marinade.

Quickly bring to a boil. Cover and bake in a preheated 325'F. oven
about 2 hours. If the sauce gets too thick, thin it with the extra
cup of broth.

TO SERVE AFTER FREEZING: Thaw according to recommendations. Reheat in
a covered casserole at 325'F. for about 20 minutes, or until bubbly.
You might add freshly cooked vegetables (mushrooms, baby carrots,
steamed potatoes). Serves 10.

vegetables begin to soften.

Over low heat in another pan, make a roux by combining 8 tablespoons
melted butter and the flour to make a base for thickening the soup.
Cook at least 2 minutes, stirring constantly, so the floury taste is
eliminated. Add the roux and the cheese to the soup pot. Add the
water, cream, oysters and their liquid. Simmer the soup until the
oysters begin to curl. Add the champagne and sherry and heat through.

Papa Joe's Cucumber & Red Onion Soup

soups, vegetables

5 cup cucumbers
3 cup red onions
6 cup sour cream
2 tablespoon salt
3 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup fresh dill weed- chopped
1/2 cup lemon juice

This is from Alice Brock at Alice's Restaurant.  Yes, THAT one.

Peel and slice cucumbers as thin as you can.  Peel and slice red
onions thin as you can.  (It's easier if you cut the onion in half
and slice cut side down)

Use a deep 1 gallon bowl or crock.  Alternate layers of cukes and
onions with sprinkles of the salt and sugar between each layer. This
will draw out the juices that make it soup. Pile sour cream on top.
DO NOT STIR. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours or more.

To serve, add the fresh dill weed and lemon juice and stir it up. Add
more lemon juice or sugar to taste.

Cool and refreshing, this is just perfect when it is too hot to cook,
and cucumbers are running wild.

Paprika Mushroom Soup

soups

12 oz mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
2 cup onion, chopped
1  garlic clove, crushed
4 tablespoon butter (or margarine)
3 tablespoon flour
1 cup milk
2 teaspoon dill weed
1 tablespoon hungarian paprika
1 tablespoon tamari
1  black pepper, to taste
1  salt, to taste
2 teaspoon lemon juice
2 cup vegetable stock or water
1/4 cup parsley, fresh
1/2 cup sour cream

Saute onions in large pot with half the butter for 5 minutes.  Add
mushrooms and crushed garlic along with dill, paprika, stock and
tamari. Simmer covered for 15 minutes.

In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat and stir in flour.  Whisk
while heating for 2 minutes, then add milk.  Stir often for 10
minutes or until thick.  Combine mushroom mixture with sauce and
simmer for 15 minutes.  Add sour cream.  Add lemon juice and salt and
pepper to taste before serving. Top with chopped parsley.

NOTES:

*  A rich dill, paprika and mushroom soup -- I first saw this at "Old
Wives Tale," a restaurant in Portland, Oregon.  The waiter there said
that this had been on the menu every day for a year, and highly
recommended it. The soup was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised to
find a recipe for it in Molly Katzen's "Moosewood Cookbook." Yield:
Serves 3-4.

*  Tamari is a kind of soy sauce; if you can't find it, you can use
ordinary soy sauce.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  1 hour.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Parker House Fish Chowder~ Boston~ 1873

soups

1  see text

"This recipe is unusual in two ways: it is remarkably 'dry,' and uses
raw, rather than fried, onions.  When made with the liquid content
called for, its consistency would be about that of corned-beef hash
and it could be heaped up on a plate.  In the following conversion to
a recipe for two persons, the liquid content is increased: 1 pound
cod, haddock, or similar fish; 1 medium-sized potato; 1 medium-sized
onion, 1/4 pound salt pork; 1 1/2 cups water; and 3/4 cup milk. Be
sure that the flame is very low under the covered pot. Have a fresh,
firm cod or haddock, a fish about 5 pounds is the best size.  Take a
saucepan large enough to hold a little more than you wish to make.
Cut salt pork in small squares about the size of dice, and fry quite
brown.  Lay in the same pan alternate layers of thin, sliced potatoes
first, then slices of fish, then broken water crackers, small fried
pork, shreds of raw onion, black pepper and salt to suit the taste.
Continue the layers until you have used up your material. Pour over
it the pork fat from the scraps and half a pint of water, to keep
from burning at the bottom.  Close the saucepan tight and set on the
fire. Cook slowly, without stirring, for 45 minutes, when it is ready
for the table. As some fish cook drier than others, if you do not
find the chowder thin enough to serve well in a tureen, add some
fresh milk just before taking up, and let it come to a boil."

Parsnip Chowder With Squash

soups, vegetables

1 lb parsnips
1 lb butternut squash or sweet potatoes
4  strips bacon
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2  stalks celery, finely chopped
3 tablespoon flour
5 cup chicken stock
1  bouquet garni of bay leaf, thyme an; d parsley
1  cinnamon stick
1 cup heavy cream
1  salt
1  freshly ground white pepper
1  cayenne pepper
1  freshly grated nutmeg
3 tablespoon chopped fresh chives

"Chowder originated as fish stew.  But in areas where seafood was
unavailable, resourceful Americans used vegetables. This recipe comes
from....Rich Spencer, a chef in the Mount Washington Valley."

Peel the parsnips and squash (or sweet potatoes) and cut each into
1/4 inch dice.  Cut the bacon into 1/4-inch strips and render it in a
large saucepan. When the bacon pieces are lightly browned, transfer
with a slotted spoon to paper towels to dry.  Discard all but 3
tablespoons af the rendered fat.

Add the onion and celery to the pan and cook over medium heat for 3
to 4 minutes, until soft but not browned. Stir in the flour and cook
for 1 minute to make a roux. Whisk in the chicken stock and bring to
a boil: the mixture will thicken slightly.

Add the bouquet garni, cinnamon stick, parsnips and squash. Simmer the
chowder for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but not
soft.  Stir in the cream, salt, pepper, cayenne and nutmeg. Just
before serving, remove the bouquet garni and cinnamon stick. Ladle
the chowder into bowls and sprinkle each with chopped chives and
nutmeg.

Serves 6 to 8.

1  freshly ground pepper
1  parmesan cheese; freshly grated (use the b

Soak beans overnight in water to cover.  Next day drain water and
rinse beans.

In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat and add the onion,
celery, and garlic.  Cook and stir gently for 3 minutes or until the
vegetables are soft and begin to color slightly. Add tomatoes,
oregano, basil, stock, parsley, and soaked beans.  I usually add 1
cup of cold water at this point to the bean mixture. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat, and simmer about 1-1/2 hours or until beans are soft.
About 30 minutes before soup is done, in a large pot of boiling
water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain and rinse. Add to the soup
mixture. Add freshly ground pepper and salt if you so desire. I do
not cook with salt at all so the soup goes without it. Guests that
wish a saltier soup can add it at the table. Serve soup with freshly
grated Parmesan cheese.

This soup is one of our favorites on a cold wintery night, I usually
serve with a mixed green salad, crusty sourdough bread, a simple
fruit cup or baked apple for dessert, and of course a good Italian
Chianti or Barbera Wine.  Serves approximately 6 people.

Pasta E Fagioli

soups

1  battuto==
2  slices lean salt pork
1 small onion
1 medium garlic clove
1  celery stalk
3 tablespoon olive oil
1  soup==
4  peeled plum tomatoes
2 quart hot water
2 teaspoon salt
2 cup cooked shell beans
2 cup small pasta
4 tablespoon grated romano or parmesan

Put the slices of salt pork on a chopping board.  Top them with the
onion, garlic and celery and chop, then mince until the pile has
turned to a paste.  Put the battuto in a big soup pot with the olive
oil over medium heat.  Saute until golden, then add the tomatoes and
cook again for about 3 minutes, or until the tomatoes have blended a
bit and softened. Add the hot water, salt and beans, and bring to a
good boil. Once the beans are heated through, crush a few beans
against the side of the pot, add the pasta and continue cooking until
it is well done. By this time the soup is really so thick you may
want to add a little more water. Taste for salt, and add some if
necessary. Serve with a sprinkling of the cheese. From The

Pasulj (Serbian Bean Soup)

beans, soup/stew, polish

1 lb dried white beans (navy or cannelli; ni)
2  onions, chopped
3  cloves garlic, minced
3  bay leaves
2 tablespoon chopped parsley
2 tablespoon tomato paste
1 large carrot, scraped and sliced
5  to 6 whole peppercorns
1 lb kielbasa, thickly sliced
1/2 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoon flour

You will need a large saucepan.  Pick over the beans for bits of grit
and chaff, and rinse them twice in cold water. Put the beans in a
large saucepan and cover them with water to a depth of 1 to 2 inches.
Bring the water to a boil and then turn down the heat. Leave to
simmer gently for half an hour.

Remove the pan from the heat and pour in enough cold water to cover
the beans to a depth of 3 inches.  The beans will settle on the
bottom. Leave them for a minute or two; then pour off the water and
replace with fresh water.  Bring the water to a boil and then turn
down the heat to simmer.

Add the onions, garlic, bay leaves, parsley, tomato paste, carrot, and
peppercorns to the beans.  Cook gently over very low heat for 1 1/2
to 2 hours, until the beans are soft. After 45 minutes of the
cooking, add the kielbasa.

Fifteen minutes before you are ready to serve, add the salt and
prepare a liaison for the soup.  Heat the oil until it is smoking
lightly; then quickly stir in the paprika, followed by the flour. Mix
to a thin paste. Add this to the soup, stirring well.  Simmer for 5
minutes, until the soup is thick and rich.

Serve with plenty of bread and good red wine.

Serves 5 to 6. Time: 2 to 2 1/2 hours

Paulo Luigi's Pasta Fagioli

italian, pasta, soups

1 lb white beans (navy or northern) 4 tb; sp. olive oil
1 medium onion; chopped fine
2  garlic cloves; minced 5 fresh basil leav
2 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon flour
1  black pepper
1  crushed red pepper
1  salt
1 pkg tubetti or rottel noodles (12 oz pk; g.)

This recipe was handed down to me from my mother. It can be made with
canned beans to save time.  Use 4 cans to 1 pound dried. Soak beans
overnight in a 5 quart pot (kettle), in twice as much water as beans.
The next day drain the beans, add fresh water just covering the beans
and boil until beans are cook (1 1/2 hours). Water level must remain
above the beans. Stir occasionally, for best results use a wooden
spoon. Keep beans warm. Generously coat a frying pan with olive oil.
Add onion and saute until translucent. Add garlic and basil leaves.
Saute 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add 1 tablespoon flour and
cook for one minute. Add 1/2 cup water, stir until thickened (1-2
minutes). Add tomato paste, stir until dissolved.  Remove from heat
and add to still warm beans. For desired thickness add water.  Stir
until mixed, adding peppers and salt to taste. Simmer over low heat
for 15 minutes stirring occasionally. Cook pasta al dente (4-5
minutes). Drain and cool. Set aside. Before serving, place pasta in
the bottom of a soup bowl. Add hot bean mixture. Mix and garnish with
parsley. Serves 6-8.

Pecan Soup

6 oz pecans
4 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 large garlic clove
:  salt & freshly ground pepper

This is a wonderful fall soup, and only 200 calories per serving.
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. ON a baking sheet, toast the pecans for 10-to-15
minutes, checking from time to time to prevent burning. Toss
occasionally. In a food processor, place the pecans, garlic and about
1/2 cup of the stock. Turn the processor on and, with the motor
running, add stock until you have a creamy consistency. (The mixture
will absorb the stock.) Pass the pecan-stock mixture through a sieve
into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the cream, season to taste
with salt and pepper and serve. PETER KUMP - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS

16 oz can creamed corn
1 can potatoes [or use cooked, chopped po; tatoes to taste s.c.]
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1  parsley
1  paprika

Here's one I got from a friend many years ago...  I haven't tried it
for a long time, but it was excellent++good enough for me to get the
recipe and I wasn't even into cooking at the time.

Fry the bacon and save 3 tablespoons of the drippings. Fry onion and
celery in the drippings until tender. Blend in flour, stirring until
bubbly. Remove from heat and stir in milk. Heat to boiling point,
stirring constantly.  Boil and stir for one minute. Stir in remaining
ingredients.

If you feel really racy, dump in a drained can of clams.

1 lb jimmy dean sausage (hot)
1  grated potato
1 tablespoon sweet basil, dried
1 tablespoon ground sage
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1  dash red pepper
1 quart chicken stock, thereabouts

Presoak (8 hrs) or preboil (1 hr) beans, drain and rinse. Add chicken
stock to soup pot and add beans. Turn heat on low. Add all
ingredients just like that. Do not precook meat. The grated potato
thickens the broth, another favorite thickener may be used, I prefer
the potato. Simmer this soup for 2 hours before serving. I probably
add more basil than listed, do that to taste.  Go easy on the sage
but it is quite important. You may add a tablespoon of sugar to perk
this soup up a bit, I do not recall off hand if I did or not. Another
ingredient to perk it up is a tablespoon of vinegar--don't overdo.

Pepper & Corn Soup With Basil

soups

1  stephen ceideburg
5 cup chicken stock
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon light olive oil
1 large leek *
1  salt and cayenne pepper
7  ears of corn, shaved, about 7 cups
3  medium-size red bell peppers, 1/2 c; up diced and about 2 cups
1  coarsely chopped
4  garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tablespoon chopped fresh basil

* white part only, cut in half lengthwise, thinly sliced, and washed,
about 2 cups

Adapted from Annie Somerville's "Fields of Greens. " The flavor of
sweet peppers is essential combine red and yellow peppers if you
like, but don't use green peppers, because their strong flavor works
against the sweetness, of the corn.

Warm the stock over low heat,

Heat the butter and 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a soup pot. Add the
leek, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few pinches of cayenne. Saute over
medium heat until the leek is heated through, about 2 minutes. Cover
the pot and steam the leek for 5 to 6 minutes, until tender.

Set aside 1 cup corn, along with the diced peppers, to be sauteed
separately and added to the soup later, Add the remaining corn and the
chopped peppers to the leek along with the garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt,
and a pinch of cayenne. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes.

Add 2 cups stock, cover, and cook over medium heat for 25 to 30
minutes, until the corn and peppers are tender. Add I cup stock,
puree in a blender or food processor, then pass the puree through a
food mill. Return the puree to the pot and cook over low heat.

Heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a saute pan. Add the remaining corn,
the diced peppers, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of cayenne; saute
until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add to the puree along with about 2
cups stock, to reach the desired consistency. Season to taste with
salt and cayenne and cook over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Add the
basil just before serving.

Pepper Rainbow Soup

soups

6 cup chicken broth
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cup rice, cooked
4  bell peppers, in assorted colors
1/2 teaspoon savory
2 teaspoon chives
2  egg yolks
2 tablespoon lemon juice
1  salt and pepper, to taste

Bring the broth to a boil.  Cook the rice.

Chop the onion and saute the pieces until they are golden brown. Add
to the broth. Add the savory and chives to the broth.

Clean the seeds and cores from the peppers and chop the cleaned
peppers into pieces. Set chopped peppers aside.

Add the rice to the broth and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the chopped
peppers to the boiling broth and simmer for 1 minute. Meanwhile, beat
the egg yolks in a 2-cup bowl.

Thicken the soup with the egg yolks by adding the hot soup to the
beaten yolks a little bit at a time, stirring constantly, until a cup
or two of soup has been added to the yolks. Dump this mixture back
into the simmering broth. Add the lemon juice. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. Serve.

NOTES:

*  A light summer soup with multicolored peppers -- Every year in late
summer, produce counters fill with multicolored bell (capsicum)
peppers. Green bell peppers, red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers.
Even purple bell peppers. Creative chefs try hard to take advantage
of the splash of colors, and make rainbow salads or rainbow
appetizers. Here is a different way to rejoice in multicolored
peppers: pepper soup. The peppers float to the top of a light broth
and artfully dodge your spoon as you try to eat them. Yield: Serves
6-8.

*  The thickening technique is identical to that used in avgolemono
recipes, which you can consult for more details.

*  The flavor and texture balance of the soup depends on the amount
that the peppers are cooked. The more you cook them, the more their
flavor exudes into the broth but the more they lose their texture. I
find that about 2 minutes in simmering broth is the right amount.

*  You can have fun with colored geometric patterns as you cut the
peppers. They don't have to be chunks. You can cut the yellow peppers
into circles and the green peppers into long strips and the red
peppers into cross sections and the purple peppers into stocky
triangles. Be creative. The colored shapes will float to the top of
the broth and play hide-and-seek with each other.

: Difficulty:  moderate (egg yolk thickening and pepper cooking
require some practice).
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  No need to measure.

Perfect Chicken Stock-Dam

poultry, soups

1 x no ingredients

1. Follow Steps for perfect poached chicken. 2. After removing bones
from chicken, return them to the saucepan and
bring liquid to boil again. Cover, Reduce heat, and let simmer 3-4
hours, set aside. 3. Pour Stock through a strainer into a bowl. 4.
When stock is completely chilled, remove all fat from surface and
discard. 5. Reheat stock just enough ot liquefy and pour into ice
cube trays.
Freeze, then place in sealable plastic bags and keep frozen. 6. Use
frozen chicken stock cubes wherever you want a little added flavor,
such as sauteing chopped onion in a non-stick pan without added
fat,
or when cooking vegetables. 7. Once you have chicken stock cubes
on hand you'll find lots of uses
for them. Note: 1 cup chicken stock cubes used in a day is
equivalent to 1 joker card or 25 optional calories. Keep track and be
honest. If you cheat you just cheat yourself.

Persian Quince Stew (Khoresh-E Beh)

lamb, stews, persian

2  onion; finely sliced
1/3 cup oil or butter
1 lb stewing meat (lamb or beef); cut in 1 inch cubes
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 cup ; water
2 large quinces
3 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup vinegar or lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground saffron; dissolved in
1 tablespoon ; water, hot
1/3 cup yellow split peas
      ----CHELO----
3 cup basmati rice
8 cup ; water
2 tablespoon salt
3/4 cup butter; melted
1/2 teaspoon saffron; dissolved in
2 tablespoon ; water, hot
2 tablespoon yogurt (opt)

In large pot, brown onions in 3 Tbsp. of oil or butter. Add meat and
brown. Add salt, pepper, and cinnamon. Add water, cover and simmer
over low heat for 1 hr, stirring occasionally.

Wash, but don't peel quinces.  Use apple corer to remove seeds. Slice
as for apple pie.  In skillet, saute in 2 Tbsp. oil or butter and set
aside.

To the meat, add sugar, vinegar or lemon juice, saffron, split peas,
and quince.  Cover and simmer 35 minutes. Check to see that meat and
fruit are cooked. Taste and correct seasoning. Transfer to deep
casserole dish and keep in warm oven until ready to serve. Serve hot
with chelo (recipe below.)

(Note: I am giving the detailed instructions for chelo. I don't use
the yogurt and I drizzle the remaining saffron over *all* the rice. I
also serve the tah dig(crust) with the rest of the rice.)

Chelo:  Wash rice 5 times in cold water.  Bring water and salt to
boil in a large non-stick pan.  Add washed and drained rice. Boil 6
minutes, stirring gently twice to loosen grains that may have stuck
to bottom. Drain rice in colander and rinse in lukewarm water.

In same pot, heat half the butter, 2 Tbsp. hot water, a drop of
dissolved saffron, and yogurt.  Taking one spatula at a time, place
rice gently in pot mounding in the shape of a pyramid.

Dissolve remaining butter in 2 Tbsp. hot water and pour over rice.
Place clean dishtowel over pot and cover firmly with lid to prevent
steam from escaping. Cook 10 minutes over medium heat and 50 minutes
over low heat. Remove from heat.

Allow to cool 5 minutes on a damp surface without removing lid. Put 2
Tbsp. of the rice in with remaining saffron and set aside for
garnish. Gently remove rice from pot without disturbing crust.
Sprinkle saffron flavored rice over top and serve. Detach crust and
serve separately.

Pheasant Casserole(English)

soup/stew, english

2  pheasants
2 tablespoon beef dripping
1  onion
1  carrot
1  stick of celery
1  salt and pepper
2  glasses red wine

Set oven to 350/F or Mark 4. Prepare the vegetables and chop them
roughly. Joint the pheasants, using the breasts and legs only (this
saves having too many bones to cope with). Heat the beef dripping in
a thick frying pan and brown the pheasant joints. Remove from the pan
and place in a casserole dish. Place the vegetables in the frying pan
and cook for 2 minutes, add the red wine and bring to the boil. Pour
the mixture over the pheasant joints, season and cover the casserole.
Cook in the oven for 1-1 1/2 hours until tender.

simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the ginger, anise and green onions.
Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes. Slice the green
onions, onion and basil leaves as thinly as possible. Slice the beef
as thinly as possible across the grain. It helps to partially freeze
the meat before slicing.  Bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Arrange the
bean sprouts, mint sprigs, chilies and lime on a platter. Just before
serving, bring the broth to a boil. Cook the rice sticks in boiling
water for 30 seconds, then drain. Presentation: Divide the noodles
among 4 large bowls. Arrange the scallions, onion slices and beef
slices on top. Spoon the boiling broth on top: The heat of the liquid
should be sufficient to cook the meat. Serve the soup at once, with
the garnish platter on the side. Let each person add sprouts, mint,
chilies, lime, hoisin sauce and/or chili sauce to taste. Yield: Makes
4 servings. Nutritional info (per serving): 206 calories, 5 grams

Pho Bac

soups, vietnamese

5 lb beef bones with marrow
5 lb oxtails
2 lb short rib plate
2 large onion; halved & unpeeled, studde
3  shallot; unpeeled
2 oz ginger, fresh; unpeeled, in
8  star anise
1  cinnamon stick
4 medium parsnip; cut into 2 pieces
2 teaspoon salt
1 lb beef sirloin
2  scallion; thinly sliced
1 tablespoon coriander; shredded
2 medium onion; sliced paper-thin
1/4 cup hot chili sauce (tuong ot) or nuoc; cham)
1 lb dried rice stick, 1/4 wide
1/2 cup nuoc mam (vietnamese fish sa
1  pepper, black
      ----GARNISH----
2 cup fresh bean sprouts
2  fresh red chile peppers; sliced
2  lime; cut into wedges
2 tablespoon olive oil
2 large garlic clove; flattened

In order to cut the beef into paper-thin slices, freeze the
pieces of meat for 30 minutes before slicing.

The night before, clean the bones under cold running water and
soak overnight in a pot with water to cover at room temperature.
(This will help loosen the impurities inside the bones. When heat is
applied, these impurities are released and come to the top much
faster and can be removed, therefore, producing a clear broth.)

Place the beef bones, oxtails and short rib plate in a large
stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Cook for 10
minutes. Drain. Rinse the pot and the bones.

Return the bones to the pot and add six quarts of water. Bring to
a boil. Skim the surface to remove the foam and fat. Stir the bones
in the bottom of the pot from time to time to free the impurities.
Continue skimming until the foam ceases to rise. Add three quarts
more water and bring to a boil. Skim off all the residue that forms
on the top. Turn the heat to low and simmer.

Meanwhile, char the clove-studded onions, shallots and ginger
directly over a gas burner or under the broiler until they release
their fragrant odors. Tie the charred vegetables, star anise and
cinnamon stick in a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth. Add the
spice bag, parsnips and salt to the simmer-ing broth. Simmer for one
hour.

Remove the short rib plates. Pull the meat away from the bones.
Reserve the meat and return the bones to the pot. Simmer the broth,
uncovered, for four to five hours. Keep an eye on it; as the liquid
boils away, add enough fresh water to cover the bones.

Meanwhile, slice the beef sirloin against the grain into paper-
thin slices, roughly two by two inches in size. Slice the reserved
short rib meat paper-thin. Set aside.

In a small bowl, combine the scallions, coriander and half of the
slice onions. Place the remaining sliced onions in a small bowl and
stir in the hot chili sauce. Blend well.

Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain and set
aside.

When the broth is ready, remove and discard all of the bones.
Strain the broth through a strainer or colander lined with a double
layer of dampened cheesecloth into a clean pot. Add the fish sauce
and bring the broth to a boil. Reduce the heat and keep the broth at
a bare simmer.

In another pot, bring four quarts of water to a boil. Drain the
noodles, then drop them in the boiling water. Drain immediately.
Divide the noodles among four large soup bowls. Top the noodles with
the sliced meats. bring the broth to a rolling boil. Ladle the broth
directly over the meat in each bowl (the boiling broth will cook the
raw beef instantly). Garnish with the scallion mixture and freshly
ground black pepper.

Serve the onions in hot chili sauce and the accompaniments on the
side. Each diner will add these ingredients as desired.

1/2 cup lemon juice
5 1/2 lb baby artichokes
4 cup white vinegar
7 tablespoon kosher salt
8  cloves garlic, thickly sliced
1  lemon, thinly sliced, seeds removed
1 tablespoon black peppercorns
1 tablespoon white peppercorns
20  sprigs fresh thyme

1. In a large bowl, combine lemon juice and 2 C of water. Remove tough
outer leaves from artichokes and cut across tops about 1 inch from
heart. Trim stems to remove dark tough skin. Cut away any bruises or
bad spots. Place artichokes in lemon water.

2. Wash 4 one-pint canning jars, lids, and screw bands in hot, soapy
water and rinse well. Place jars upright on a wire rack in the bottom
of a large pot. Fill pot with hot water until jars are submerged by 1
to 2 inches, and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes. Turn off heat;
leave jars in water. Sterilize lids according to manufacturer's
instructions.

3. Combine vinegar, 1 1/2 C water, salt, garlic, and sliced lemon in a
large pot and bring to a boil. Drain artichokes, add to pot, and
simmer for
1    minute.

4. Using stainless-steel tongs, remove jars from water and place on a
layer of clean towels. Divide peppercorns evenly among jars. Add 5
sprigs thyme to each jar. Using a clean slotted spoon, remove
artichokes, garlic, and lemon slices from pot and pack tightly into
jars, pressing them down with the back of a clean spoon. Leave 1/4
inch of space beneath the rim of the jar. Pour hot liquid over
artichokes, covering them by 1/4 inch and leaving 1/2 inch of space
at the top of each jar. Slide a clean plastic chopstick or wooden
skewer along the side of the jar to release any air bubbles. Wipe
mouth of jar with a clean, damp cloth. Place hot lid on jar; screw on
band firmly without forcing.

5. Place a wire rack in the bottom of a large pot and fill partway
with hot water. Using a jar lifter, place the jars on the rack. Add
enough hot water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil. Boil for
10 minutes. Remove jars from water bath with jar lifter; let stand on
clean dish towels for 24 hours. Check cool jars for the slight
indentation in the lids that indicates a vacuum seal. Jars that do
not seal properly or that leak during processing should be stored in
the refrigerator and pickles consumed within a week. Allow sealed
pickles to mellow in a cool, dry place for a few days before serving.
Store opened jars in the refrigerator.

Pipestone Lamb Stew

main dish, stews, veal

2  bay leaves
1 large bunch fresh thyme sprigs* or
1 teaspoon dried thyme
4  allspice berries
4 lb lamb stew meat with bones - trimmed
2 medium onions; peeled and halved - cut i
6 large garlic cloves; peeled - coarsely chopped
1 1/2 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup prepared horseradish
1/4 cup worcestershire sauce
28 oz can plum tomatoes
3 medium carrots; peeled**
8 oz button mushrooms - stems trimmed -; caps coarsely chopped
3 large celery ribs; trimmed***
2 medium waxy potatoes - peeled and quartere; d
2 medium russet potatoes; peeled - cut in eighths
1  salt and pepper; to taste
      ----GARNISH----
1 small bunch italian parsley - (opt'l.)

*Strip leaves from the thyme sprigs, to equal abt. 2 tb. of fresh
thyme.

**Cut carrots diagonally into 1/2" thick slices.

***Cut celery ribs diagonally into 1/2" thick slices.

Tie bay leaves, thyme and allspice berries together in a piece of
cheesecloth; set aside.

Brown lamb on all sides in a large (at least 8 qt.) heavy stockpot
over medium-high heat, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the onions and garlic and
cook, stirring frequently, until onions begin to turn translucent, 3
to 4 minutes.

Add the cheesecloth bundle, wine, horseradish, Worcestershire and all
the vegetables to the meat, crushing the tomatoes with your hands or
a wooden spoon.  Season generously with salt and pepper.  Bring to a
boil, then cover, reduce heat to medium, and cook until potatoes are
tender and lamb is falling from the bone, about 3 hours. (You can
also transfer the stew to a preheated 350 F. oven and cook it there
for the same amount of time.)

Remove cover and continue cooking the stew until it has thickened
somewhat but is still soupy, an additional 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove
the cheesecloth bundle and season to taste, adding more horseradish
if you like. Mince parsley; sprinkle over stew.  Serve immediately.

Yield: 8 to 10 servings.  St. Francis Merlot 1987 goes well with this.

Note: This is a good dish to prepare a day ahead. Remove the
cheesecloth bundle and refrigerate the stew overnight. The next day,
skim any fat that has solidified on the surface and reheat the stew.
Season to taste, adding more horseradish if you like. Garnish with
parsley and serve.

Loomis writes:  "This recipe comes from Ann Olson, whose husband,
Sherman, raises sheep - and the grains they eat - on their farm in
Danvers, Minnesota.  Ann makes a variety of lamb dishes throughout
the year, and this is one of her favorites.  ('Pipestone' is the name
of a town in southern Minnesota, the home of a school where
youngsters learn to raise sheep.  This stew, which has evolved over
the years, is made there.)

"Horseradish is a curious seasoning for lamb, but it adds a pleasant
bite...Lamb stew meat is often neck meat, which is some of the most
flavorful on the animal. If you do use neck meat, consider removing
the considerable amount of bone before serving the stew."

Pix Rowe Miller's Family Fish Chowder

fish, soups

6 slice bacon -- 1/4 thick
3 cup diced yellow onions
6 medium potatoes -- peeled
1 lb haddock
1 lb cod
2 can evaporated milk -- (3 cups)
1 cup whole milk
1  salt
1  freshly ground pepper

Fry the bacon, remove from the pan, and place on a paper towel. Saute
the onions in the bacon fat and set the pan aside. Cut the potatoes
in half the long way, then into 1/4" slices. Put them in a
nonreactive pot large enough for the chowder. Cover the potatoes with
water and boil until tender. Becareful not to put in too much water
or the chowder will be soupy. While the potatoes are cooking, cut the
fish into generous bite-sized pieces. When the potatoes are ready,
add the fish to the pot, cover and simmer until the fish flakes. When
the fish is done, crumble the bacon and add it to the pot along with
the onions and any grease in the pan, the evaporated and whole milks.
Bring the mixture to boil, cover, and turn the heat down. Simmer for
five minutes and add salt and pper to taste. Chowder invariably
tastes better when made a day ahead.

According to Katherine Hall Page.... The Rowe recipe may be happily
modified in all sorts of ways. The chowder is still quite delectable
with olive oil instead of bacon fat. You may also use salt pork. Two
kinds of fish make for a more interesting chowder, but these can be
any combination of the following: haddock, cod, pollack, monkfish and
hake. Finally there is the question of garnishes: dill chopped
parsley, oyster crackers, butter are all good. And Faith and Pix's
friend on Sanpere, Jane Weiss, swears by her chowder to which she
adds curry spices!

"Plommek soup is tradtionally served with a spoonful of sour cream on
top; this is carefully swirled out with a spoon to amke a spiral
shape, representative of the galaxy. The outline of the galaxy is
then emphasized with very finely chopped parsley. for less festive
occaisions, it may be served with a small spoonful of butter (or
maragarine) in the centre. In the pot, melt the butter and when it is
foamy, add the onion and fry until golden. Add everything else to the
pot except the last cup of water and the sour cream and parsley
garnishes. simmer, covered, for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the
potatoes and carrots are tender. Run it all through the blender,
about 1 to 1 1/2 cups at a time. When it is all pureed, rinse the
cooking pot with the cup of water and add that to the 'empty'
blender. Run the blender for a few seconds and then slosh the water
about to get as much of the vegetable puree as possible off the sides
of the blender. Add this liquid to the soup. Pour the soup back into
the cleaned out pot and reheat it before serving (use very gentle
heat). Ladle into bowls. Garnish with sour cream and parsley as
described above.

and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.

2. Reduce heat to medium low so that liquid is barely simmering. Add
plums and poach until tender, 30 seconds to 1 minute. (If plums are
not very ripe, this will take longer.) Remove plums from liquid and
let cool. Reduce poaching liquid to the consistency of light syrup.
For an elegant presentation, Pull plum skin back from fruit, leaving
it attached at the stem end (this doesn't work on all plum
varieties). Serve plums with some of the poaching liquid.

2 tablespoon split peas, dried
2 tablespoon cracked wheat
1/4 cup dehydrated vegetable flakes
1  ; (soup greens)
2 teaspoon sesame seeds
2 teaspoon sunflower seeds
1 teaspoon nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt

Grind split peas, cracked wheat, vegetable flakes and seeds in blender
until they are a fine powder. Combine ground mixture with yeast and
salt. Store in a covered container at room temperature. To use, add 1
heaping teaspoon soup mix to 6 ounces of boiling water, or 2 level
teaspoons to 1 cup boiling water. Stir, let sit a few minutes, and
serve. Makes 3/4 Cup dried soup mix - enough for 18 cups of soup.
Note: this is one of those times when a blender seems to do a much
more efficient job than the food processor. Note 2: Those who enjoy
an instant cup of broth but are dismayed by the use of flavor
enhancers and the abundance of salt in commercial brands may welcome
the chance to make their own soup mix.

Portugal: Fish Stew (Caldeirada De Peixe)

seafood, soup/stew

1/2 lb fish; whatever available or  sh
2 pinch salt
4 tablespoon olive oil
2  onions; chopped
8  tomatoes; peeled & chopped
1  green pepper; seeded &  chopped
4 large cloves garlic; crushed
1 pinch nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
3 teaspoon piri-piri sauce  see recipe
1 small glass dry white wine
1  handful coriander leaves; chopped
4  slices of bread with the  crusts cu; t off

This is a real fisherman's stew, dependent on whatever the boats have
brought in.  The spices and hervs give the dish its special Portuguese
identity.

Clean the fish and cut into fairly small pieces, removing as many
bones as possible.  Sprinkle the salt over the fish and leave while
you make the following sauce. Heat 2-3 Tbsp of the oil in a saucepan
and stir in the onions, tomatoes and pepper. Cook gently until they
start to soften, then put in the garlic, nutmeg, allspice and
piri-piri sauce. Add the wine and a little water. Cook for about 5
minutes, stirring frequently, then remove from the heat. Lightly oil
the bottom of a shallow, ovenproff dish (preferably earthenware). Put
in a layer of fish followed by a layer of sauce and sprinkle with
coriander. Continue with these layers until the ingredients are used
up. Cover the top of with the bread and sprikle well with the
remaining oil or dot with a little butter. Cook in a pre-heated oven
at 350 degrees F. for about 30 minutes or until the fish is tender.
Serve with boiled or sliced and fried potatoes, bread and a slad to
make a substantial main meal. If you cannot obtain coriander leaves,
you can use fresh parsley instead, but this will alter the flavour of
the dish.

Possum Or Bandicoot Soup

soups

1 each small possum or bandicoot*
2 liter water
1 teaspoon salt
1 each tin corn*
1  any other vegies desired
1 pinch celery leaves
1 pinch parsley
1  flour or gravox* to thicken
1  fried bread,1 slice per serv

Skin and clean possum or bandicoot, then quarter the animal. (Video
tape this please. I have no idea how to do it. Also "first you have
to catch a possum or bandicoot", but then that's another story.)
Place it in a large pot or camp oven along with water and salt. Cover
and simmer gently for 3 or 4 hours. (Tough little devils apparently.)
Add vegetables and simmer for another 1 1/2 hours (Still tough. Even
the vegies are resisting being associated with this.) Strain soup
through a large holed colander when meat has left bone and remove
bones, especially small ones. Return soup to the pot and add parsley
and celery leaves. Thicken with a little flour or gravox. Cut fried
bread into 1 inch squares and serve soup over toast,boiling hot.

*For those of you that haven't met a bandicoot, it is something
between a possum and a raccoon, sort of, I think, maybe.

*Tin of corn? Well a can I guess, 16 oz.

*Now, when you boil this meat for 5 1/2 hours, strain it and throw it
away, it does make me wonder why you started in the first place.

*Gravox is a meat concentrate seasoning I think. The dish must be
need some flavor.

*Fry the bread any way you want to.

*All things considered, a brick or stone would be a reasonable
alternative if you don't happen to have a possum or bandicoot
available.

1/4 cup leek; chopped,white part only
2 tablespoon flour

Potage du Ble

This fresh corn soup from Renard Jacques, chef at Auberge Benedict
Arnold in St. Georges is rich and creamy. It may be made with frozen
or canned corn kernels, but it won't have the same delicate sweetness.

Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add milk, corn and salt;
cook just until corn is tender. Strain cooking liquid into a bowl and
set corn aside. Heat butter in same saucepan and saute celery, onion
and leek until softened. Blend in flour; cook until bubbly. Stir in
reserved corn cooking liquid. Bring to a boil, then partially cover
and let simmer for 15 to
20    minutes.
Place corn and liquid in food processor or blender and puree in
batches until smooth. Return to saucepan and add cream. Adjust
seasonings with salt and pepper to taste. Reheat until piping hot.

Potato Leek & Cod Soup

diabetic, main dish, soups, vegetables

1  stephen ceideburg
1 lb salt cod (see note)
4 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter
2 cup finely sliced leek rounds, white pa; rts only (4 large leeks)
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 1/2 lb waxy potatoes *
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill

* peeled and thinly sliced (5 medium, see note)

Soak salt cod overnight, changing water at least once.

The next day, drain and place salt cod and milk in pan. In a sauce
pan, cover and cook over medium heat 8 minutes. Remove salt from pan.
Pour milk through strainer and set milk aside. Flake and discard any
skin and bones. Set cod aside.

Melt butter in clean saucepan over low heat. Add leeks and cook
stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour.
Stir in reserved milk, potatoes and pepper. Increase heat to medium.
Cover and cook 15 minutes. Add cod and remove from heat.

This soup may be made up to a day in advance to this point. Cool,
cover and refrigerate.

Place sour cream in small bowl. Reheat soup over medium heat until
piping hot. Thin sour cream with 1/2 cup hot soup, then pour mixture
into soup pot. Do not heat soup again or sour cream will curdle. Pour
soup into tureen, sprinkle with fresh dill and serve.

Note: Other white fish, such as fresh cod, halibut or flounder, be
used, either in combination with salt cod or by themselves,

Note: Use waxy, less starchy potatoes, such as new potatoes, low
Finnish, Kennebecks, red rose or white rose, to avoid a mealy texture.

2  strips bacon, cut into
1  1/2-inch wide pieces
1 medium onion, chopped
4  poblano chiles, roasted,
1  seeded, peeled and diced
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fresh black pepper

6 medium yukon gold potatoes

1  .potatoes, unpeeled, chopped
1 cup crema, creme fraiche or
1  .sour cream
1/2 cup grated anejo cheese
1  (optional)

In a heavy Dutch oven or stockpot, fry the bacon over moderate heat,
stirring frequently, until it starts to brown. Toss in the onions,
half of the diced Poblanos, the salt and pepper and cook until
slightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Spoon out any excess fat. Stir in
the garlic and cook briefly just to release the aroma, 1 to 2
minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, add the potatoes and bring to a
boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook 20 minutes. Puree in a food
processor or blender just until smooth, being careful not to
over-process. Over-working will result in a gummy soup. Return to the
pot, stir in the Crema, Creme Fraiche or sour cream and bring just to
a boil. Stir in the remaining Poblanos for garnish. Sprinkle with
grated Anejo, if desired, and serve hot. Yield: 6-8 servings

Potato Soup (Low Fat)

soups, vegetables

1  text only

Get out a pot about the size of the amount of soup you want to make.
Fill it about 1/2 full of water.  Peel and dice potatoes into bite
size chunks, about 1 medium size per person. Put them into the water.
Dice a medium size onion, add to the pot.  Peel a couple of carrots,
slice then thin to cook in about the same amount of time as the
potatoes. Bring to boil on the stove, turn down and simmer.  Season
with salt and pepper to taste. (Lots of pepper, for my taste). When
the potatoes and carrots are soft, add 1 can of evaporated skim milk.
I do not thicken the soup with anything, but I do cook the potatoes
till they are quite done. I put diced cheese into the bowls, ladle
the hot soup into the bowls. If you used a low fat cheese, you could
do this too, or you can skip the cheese. Also, to make a more filling
soup, I add "rivells" to my soup (for a low fat soup, you would have
to use egg substitute).  Take 1 or 2 eggs, beaten slightly, add 1
half eggshell full of milk, and salt to taste, then flour to make a
fairly stiff dough, drop little bits of this from a fork into the
boiling soup. If you add the rivells just after the soup boils, they
will be done when the potatoes are done, proceed with the evaporated
milk, etc. The above soup would have no fat, (except the rivells
version) till you add the cheese. Oh, yes, if I have celery, I throw
in a stalk or two diced with the onion and carrot. You can't make
anything any simplier.

Potato Soup Scented With Cumin

soups, potatoes

3 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 cup chopped shallots
3 lb red skin potatoes; peeled  and cut into 3/4
1 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin
12 cup chicken stock
1 cup half and half  or evaporated skim m; ilk
1  salt
1  fresh ground pepper
4 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro

Melt butter in large, heavy, non-aluminum, deep-sided pan over
medium-high heat. When hot add shallots and cook, stirring
constantly, until soft, about 3 minutes. Add potatoes and cumin. Toss
and cook 1 minute more. Add stock. Bring to boil, stirring several
times to prevent potatoes from sticking to pan. Reduce heat and
simmer until potatoes are quite tender, 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove soup from heat and puree, using food processor, blender or food
mill. Return mixture to pan and stir in half and half. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. (Soup can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cool,
cover and refrigerate.)

To serve soup warm, reheat over medium heat, stirring, until hot. To
serve cold, taste chilled soup once again and add salt and pepper if
needed. (Cold foods often require extra seasonings.)

Ladle into 8 bowls and garnish each with 1/2 teaspoon chopped
cilantro. Makes 8 servings.

Potato Soup With Kale & Bacon

soup/stew

2 lb boiling potatoes
3/4 lb bacon
1 lb kale
2  cloves garlic
1  salt and pepper
1 cup heavy cream
1  chicken stock as necessary
5 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1  bunch chives
1  diced green onion tops/botto

Peel potatoes and put in a pot with cold, salted water to cover.
Cover pot and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, uncover, and
cook until done, about 25 minutes. Drain, reserving cooking liquid.
Break up the potatoes with a potato masher (they should be quite
lumpy, not smooth). Meanwhile, cook the bacon over low heat until
crisp, turning often. Drain and chop into 1/2 inch chunks. Pour off
all but 2 TBS of the bacon fat, and, reserve extra fat. Stem and chop
the kale. Mince the garlic. Put half the kale and half the garlic
into the frying pan. Season with salt and pepper and cook over medium
heat until kale is wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat
using more bacon fat as needed. Return all kale to the fry pan and
add the heavy cream. Simmer over very low heat until the kale is
tender, about 10 more minutes. Combine potatoes with about 3 cups of
the potato cooking liquid and 1 cup of the chicken stock. Add more
stock if needed to get a good consistency. Add kale mixture (with the
bacon) to the pot and bring to a simmer. Season to taste with the
vinegar and salt and pepper. This is up to you as to how much vinegar
you use. Mince the chives or green onions and place in an extra bowl
to top the soup. I hope you find this excellent soup. It is great
this time of year as it is much like a warm German Potato salad.  If
you pass this one up you will be the loser. Take care from Ken/still

Potato Soup With Lemons

appetizers, fruits, soups, vegetables

2 tablespoon oil
2 each yellow onion, sliced
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon ginger, grated
1 cup lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
4 cup water
4 large red potatoes, boil & chop
2 tablespoon italian parsley, chopped

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. When it begins to
foam, add the onions, lemon zest, and ginger and saute until the
onions are translucent, about 10 min. Add the lemon juice with sugar,
salt and pepper; continue to saute for 2-3 min longer. Add the water,
raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat
to medium, and simmer until the broth is golden and the onions have
almost completely disintegrated, about 30 min.

Remove from the heat and strain through a sieve into a clean
container; discard the contents of the sieve. Working in batches if
necessary, combine the strained stock and the potatoes in a blender
or food processor and puree until smooth. Transfer the puree to a
clean saucepan and bring to a gentle boil.

Ladle into warmed soup bowls and garnish each serving with a little
of the parsley.

Potato-Sorrel Soup

vegetarian

4 tablespoon butter
7 cup water
3 medium leeks; the white parts only
1  chopped or cut
1  into 1/4-inch rounds
6 cup loosely packed sorrel leaves
1  the stems removed and
1  leaves roughly chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste)
1 1/2 lb red potatoes; quartered
1  lengthwise & thinly sliced
1  freshly ground pepper
1  creme fraiche
1 tablespoon chives
1  thinly sliced or snipped

This is a rather rustic soup. For a more refined version, pass it
through a food mill before serving.

MELT THE BUTTER IN A SOUP POT and add 1/2 cup water. Add the leeks,
sorrel and salt, then cook gently, covered, for 5 minutes over
medium-low heat. Add the potatoes and cook another 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally, then pour in the rest of the water and
gradually bring the soup to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until
the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Once the potatoes are
soft, help break them down by pressing them against the side of the
pan, making the soup as rough or smooth as you like. Or, if you
prefer, pass the soup through a food mill. Taste the soup for salt
and add more, if necessary. Serve with freshly ground pepper, a
spoonful of creme fraiche swirled in and a delicate sprinkling of
chives over the top. If you've got garden chives and they're in
bloom, separate the individual flowers at the base and sprinkle on a
few along with the green stems.

Pozole

holiday, soups, southwest

3 lb pork shoulder (or shoulder chops),; with bones in
29 oz white hominy (one can), with packin; g juice
6  garlic cloves
2 tablespoon chili powder (or more to taste)
2 teaspoon salt

Put the pork shoulder piece(s) in a large kettle. Don't bother to cut
them up.  Cover with cold water, about 10 cups. Slowly bring to a
simmer, uncovered. As it simmers for the first 10 minutes or so, skim
off any scum that rises to the surface.  (It will stop appearing
after this.)

Simmer, partially covered, for at least two hours. Don't let too much
water boil away; just leave the lid a bit ajar so a small amount of
steam can escape.

Remove from heat.  Remove the pork pieces from the broth and cut the
meat from the bones. Discard the bones. Cut the meat in medium chunks
(whatever size is appropriate for stew) and return it to the broth.

Crush or mince the garlic.  Add the hominy with its juice, garlic,
chili powder and salt to the pork and broth. Adjust the chili powder
to your taste. The estimate here is for a mild store-bought unblended
spice and will produce a mild pozole. If you grind your own chiles,
they may be hotter.  If you use a blend of chili powder and other
spices (which is not recommended), you will probably want to reduce
the salt. Remember that chili powder becomes mellowed and less spicy
as it cooks.

Return to heat and simmer (partially covered as before) for another
two hours. By this time, some of the meat will still be in chunks,
and some will be shredded. Skim the grease from the top; there may be
quite a bit. Check for salt before serving. (Don't try to add
anything else at the end; chili powder and garlic need time to cook.)

I serve this with corn tortillas, wrapped in foil and warmed in the
oven for ten or fifteen minutes.

NOTES:

*  A simple New Mexican holiday stew -- This stew is from New Mexico.
It is traditionally served on special days, such as Christmas Eve or
New Year's Eve.

*  An alternate way of cooking the stew is to simmer the pork for at
least one hour, remove the bones and add the other ingredients as
described above, and cook covered in a slow oven (275 (135 ) for
several hours.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  1 hour preparation, 2 hours cooking.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

Puchero

meats, mexican, soup/stew

1/2 cup chickpeas
2 small zucchini
1/4 lb boneless lamb
2 small sweet potatoes
1/4 lb boneless beef
1 cup corn cut from the cob
3 lb chicken
2  white potatoes, boiled in jackets
1/2 lb ham
3  barely ripe bananas
1 large onion
1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds, crushed
3  cloves garlic
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1  veal knuckle, split
3 tablespoon oil (or butter)
1 teaspoon salt
2  pears
2 quart chicken broth
3  peaches
1/2 small cabbage
2  limes
2 small turnips
1 large carrot

"Puchero is to Mexican cooking what Pot-au-Feu is to French. The
difference lies in Puchero's imaginative combination of vegetables
and fruits. Since it is even more delicious the second day, this
recipe will make an ample amount to serve 8 for dinner, with some
left over for lunch the following day."

Place the chick peas in a kettle, cover with broth, and soak
overnight.

Cut the lamb and beef into 2-inch cubes, cut the chicken into serving
pieces, and dice the ham.  Peel and slice the onion and garlic.
Combine the drained chick peas, all the meats, the veal knuckle,
onion, garlic, and salt in a large soup kettle.  Cover with 2 quarts
of cold water and bring to a full boil.  Skim off the froth. Lower
the heat, cover, and simmer for
45    minutes.

Cut the cabbage into eight wedges. Peel and slice the turnips and
carrot. Slice the zucchini. Peel and dice the sweet potatoes. Cut the
corn from the cob.  Add the cabbage, turnips, carrot, zucchini, sweet
potatoes, and corn to the kettle. Cover and simmer about 20 minutes
or until meats and vegetables are tender.

Peel the boiled white potatoes and cut into thick slices. Peel
bananas and cut into 2-inch slices. Saute potatoes, sprinkled with
crushed coriander seeds and pepper in oil. Remove the potato slices
with a slotted spoon. Keep warm.  In the same oil saute the bananas
until golden. Keep warm with the potatoes.

Peel, core, and slice the pears and peaches.  Put in a small pan with
a little water and poach for 10 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain the
fruit.

Adjust the seasonings. Serve each bowl of soup with the juice from
one lime wedge and a Tbsp. of Guacamole.

Pumpkin & Broccoli Chowder

soups, vegetables

3 tablespoon butter or corn oil
1  large onion, chopped
1 tablespoon tamari/shoyu soy sauce
1  ripe tomato, diced
4 cup chicken or vegetable stock
4 cup fresh pumpkin puree or
4 cup fresh butternut puree or
4 cup canned pumpkin puree
1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  bunch broccoli
1/4 cup (to 1/2c) whipping cream

Cut the tops of the broccoli into small flowerets; julienne the stems
into strips roughly 1/4 x 1 inch.
1.  In a 10-inch skillet, melt the butter or heat the oil over
medium-low heat.  Add the onion and saute slowly until almost limp
but not brown, about 6 to 7 minutes. Add the tamari/shoyu soy sauce
and the tomato. Cook, stirring often, until the tomato's juice has
evaporated, about 5 minutes.
2.  Transfer the saute to a soup pot.  Deglaze the saute pan with a
little of the stock, and add the pan contents, plus the remainder of
the stock, to the soup pot. Add the pumpkin or squash puree, the
maple syrup or honey, salt, and a touch of freshly ground black
pepper. Heat, stirring often.
3.  Separately, in a small pot with a tightly fitting lid, steam the
broccoli flowerets and stems until tender-crisp (they should be a
bright green), about 3 to 4 minutes.
4.  Stir the steamed broccoli into the soup, then stir in the cream.
Let the soup cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until hot and
the flavors have blended, 8 to 10 minutes. Do not let the soup boil.
Serve hot.

Serves 8 as a first course.  By adding some diced cooked potatoes
with the broccoli it will serve 4 as an entree.

Pumpkin Cheese Soup

soups

1  pumpkin (big enough to hold 6-10 se; rvings of soup)
2 tablespoon butter, melted
2 tablespoon butter
1 large onion, chopped
2 large carrots, shredded
2  celery sticks, chopped
4 cup vegetable broth
1  garlic clove, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
3/4 cup cream, light
1 cup cheddar or gruyere cheese, grated
1/3 cup white wine, dry
2 tablespoon parsley, minced

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Butter a baking sheet.

Prepare pumpkin:  cut off the top, scoop out seeds, brush inside with
about 2 T melted butter. Replace top and place pumpkin on baking
sheet. Bake 45 mins or until tender when pierced with a fork. The
pumpkin should be a bit droopy but still hold its shape well.

Meanwhile, melt about 2 T butter in a big saucepan. Add onion,
carrots, celery.  Saute until soft, about 10 mins. Add broth, garlic,
salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cover and simmer 20 minutes. Cool slightly.

Puree vegetable mixture in 2 or 3 batches in a blender or food
processor. Put back in saucepan; stir in the cream. Reheat. Add
cheese and wine, heat until cheese melts. Stir frequently after
adding milk to avoid scorching. Place hot pumpkin on serving platter.
Pour in soup. Sprinkle with parsley.

Serve the soup by ladling out of the pumpkin at the table, scooping a
little bit of pumpkin into each serving. The pumpkin then makes a
great centerpiece for your table, while allowing people to have
second helpings.

NOTES:

*  Cheese soup in a pumpkin shell -- This recipe came from the 1983
Half Moon Bay Pumpkin Festival and was published in our local
newspaper in 1984.

*  I use half gruyere and half cheddar.  Shred the cheeses very
finely so they will melt rapidly. After the soup is all gone, the
pumpkin can be cut up, washed, and used in pumpkin pie. It may need
more baking to become soft enough to puree for the pies.

*  It was impossible to find pumpkins after Halloween near San
Francisco, but fortunately they keep for a month until Thanksgiving
in a cool area if left uncut.

*  In North America, light cream is often called half and half.

Pumpkin Corn Soup With Ginger Lime Cream

native amer, soups

3 cup corn kernels
2  garlic cloves, finely chopped
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon white pepper
3 cup chicken stock
3 cup cooked pumpkin
      ----GARLIC CREAM----
2  limes, juice and zest only
1 tablespoon peeled and grated fresh ginger
1/2 cup heavy cream

This simple recipe is easy to prepare and utilizes two very basic
ingredients in Southwestern cooking:  pumpkin and corn.  It is a
delicious, rich-bodied soup, and the Ginger Lime Cream adds a
refreshing zest. *****

In a medium covered pot, cook the corn kernels with a little water
until soft, about 10 minutes.  In a food processor, process the corn
until smooth and run through a sieve and discard the skins.

Combine the corn puree, garlic, salt, white pepper, and stock in a
saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat
to low, add the pumpkin, and cook 10 minutes while stirring.

In another saucepan cook the lime juice and ginger 2 minutes over
medium heat.  Remove from the heat and pour through a sieve to remove
the ginger. In a bowl, combine the ginger-lime juice, the lime zest
(save some for the garnish), and cream.  Whip until the mixture has
soft peaks.

Spoon a dollop of Ginger Lime cream onto each bowl filled with soup
and garnish with the remaining line zest.  Serve immediately.

Pumpkin Soup

iroquois, native

1  small pumpkin. about 12 or canned (; 29 oz)
2 tablespoon sunflower oil (for fresh pumpkin) o; r peanut oil
3 tablespoon maple syrup or honey
1/2 teaspoon ground dried spicebush berries or a; llspice
4 cup beef or chicken broth
1  thinly sliced green onions
1  chopped hazelnuts
1  roasted pumpkin and sun flower seed; s, for garnish

In early pumpkin soup recipes of the northeastern woodland indians,
the pumpkin would have been baked whole in hot ashes. Peeled and
chopped pumpkin would then have been thinned with broth from wildfowl
or game.
If using fresh pumpkin, preheat oven to 350 deg F. Place pumpkin in
a baking dish and roast until easily pierced with a knife, about 1
hour. Allow pumpkin to cool, slice off top and scoop out seeds.
Clean pumpkin fibers from seeds and discard fibers. Toss seeds with
oil and salt to taste. Spread out on a baking sheet and return to
oven 15-20 minutes, until crisp and golden. Reserve for garnish and
snacks.
Scrape pumpkin flesh from shell and mash, or puree if a smoother
mixture is desired.
Place fresh or canned pumpkin in a large saucepan and season with
salt, pepper, syrup and allspice or spicebush berries. Granually stir
in enough broth to make soup thin or thick consistency, as desired.
Simmer over medium heat about 5 minutes, until hot. If desired, serve
soup in small pumpkin or squash shells. Garnish with onions,
hazelnuts, and pumpkin seeds.

Pumpkin Soup With Chives

herbs, soups, vegetables

1/2 cup onion; diced
5 cup homemade chicken stock - well seaso; ned
2 1/2 cup pumpkin puree - canned or fresh*
1  salt and nutmeg; to taste
1  cayenne pepper; to taste
2 cup light cream
      ----GARNISH----
1  whipped cream (opt'l.)
1  fresh chives; chopped
      ----PRESENTATION----
1  hollowed-out pumpkin shell plus lid; (opt'l.)

*If using fresh pumpkin:  Wash, halve and scrape out seeds and fiber.
Peel and cube.  Cook, covered, in boiling water until tender (about
25 minutes). Mash in blender or by hand and let drain in strainer for
30 minutes. You'll need about 5 cups of cubed fresh pumpkin to yield
enough cooked puree. If you plan to use the pumpkin shell as the soup
tureen, cook all the cubed pumpkin, saving any leftover puree for use
in pies, breads or muffins.

To make the soup:  Cook diced onion with stock in a large saucepan for
about 10 minutes.  Add pumpkin puree and seasonings. Process in
blender or food processor until smooth. Return to saucepan. Add cream
and heat through, but do not allow to boil. Taste and adjust
seasonings.

Ladle into pumpkin shell if desired, replace lid, and ladle into
individual bowls at the table.  Garnish each with a dollop of whipped
cream and sprinkle with chopped chives.

Puree Of Yellow Squash Soup

digest, soups

1 lb yellow crooked-neck squash (
1  approx  6 small ones)
2 cup chopped onion
1  clove garlic, sliced
2 tablespoon butter ( i ommitted this
1  altogether)
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme (or 2 tsp.
1  minced fresh thyme)
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon dried basil ( or 1 to 2 tbsp
1  minced fresh basil) ( i used
2  tbsp
1  fresh basil -i am glad i
1  did!)
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon unbleached white flour ( i
1  bet wheat flour would be
1  even better)
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 cup milk ( i used 1% westsoy,
1  vanilla)
1  freshly ground black pepper

optional topping:

2 tsp olive oil or butter ( I sauteed the bell pepper strips down the
McDougall way with water) 1 small red bell pepper, cut in thin strips
1 clove garlic, minced minced chives, (I use green onion tops)
Directions: in original form but with my comments.

1)  Cut the end off the squash, and peel if the skin looks looks
suspicious in any way. Then cut the squash into 1/4 inch slices and
set aside. (I used my cuisinart) 2) In a large saucepan or a Dutch
oven (I used a non-stick pan because I ommitted butter), begin
sauteing onions and garlic in *butter* over medium heat. After about
5 minutes, add squash, herbs, and salt. Stir, cover, and continue to
cook about 10 more minutes. 3) Gradually sprinkle in the flour,
stirring constantly. Continue to cook and stir over low heat about 5
minutes. 4) Pour in the white wine, stir briefly, cover, and let
simmer 10 to 15 minutes. (Note: The alcoholic content of the wine
dissipates with cooking, and the taste of the wine diminishes
gradually. So if you let if cook a little longer at this step, you
will get a more subtle result. Just be sure to stir everything up
from the bottom from time to time, so it won't stick or scorch.)
Remove from heat, and allow the soup to cool until it's cool enough
to puree. 5) Puree the soup with the milk in a food processor or
blender, and return it to a kettle. At this point, you may choose to
strain the soup through a fine strainer or a sieve to get a smoother
texture. (I don't think this is necessary at all) Adjust the
seasonings. Add black pepper to taste. 6) Heat gently just before
serving. 7)  While the soup is heating, prepare the optional
topping.Saute the bell pepper and garlic in olive oil or butter until
just tender. Spoon a little bit of this into each steaming bowl of
soup, and sprinkle with minced chives. (my water-sauteed bell pepper
strips worked just fine)

Prep time: 45 minutes, Yield: 4 to 6 Servings

This recipe is designed primarily for yellow crooked-neck squash ( a
summer squash), but in the winter you can substitute for acorn and
butternut.

To freeze yellow crooked-neck squash (so you can use it later in the
winter), cut the squash into 1/4-inch slices, and drop into a
saucepan of boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain and cool. Then wrap
airtight in a plastic bag or container and freeze.

To use acorn or butternut squash in this recipe, peel and seed a 1-lb.
squash. Chop it into small piecesk and steam or boil until tender.
Drain well. Then simply follow the recipe, biginning with step 2,
substituting this cooked winter squash for the yellow crooked neck.

Quick Avgolemono Soup

greek, soups

1 cup white rice, cooked
3 cup chicken broth
1  lemon, juiced
2 large eggs

If you don't have any leftover white rice, put about 1
1/2    cup of rice on to cook.

Heat the chicken broth to boiling.  While the chicken broth is
heating, beat together the lemon juice and eggs in a small bowl or
glass measuring cup until uniform in color.

When the chicken broth is boiling, stir in the cooked rice. Remove
from heat and stir briskly while slowly pouring the egg mixture into
the pot from about a foot in the air. The soup should end up
resembling a cream soup and there should be no large, visible threads
of egg.

NOTES:

*  Greek egg-lemon soup -- This is a perfect way to use up a little
leftover rice.

*  This recipe even works well with canned chicken broth since the
lemon covers up the "canned" flavor.

: Difficulty:  Easy
: Time:  20 minutes if you have to cook the rice, 10 minutes if you
don't. : Precision:  No need to measure.

Ragout De Porc - Pork Stew

pork, stews

2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 lb pork (boston butt), trimmed
1  and cut into cubes
1 large onion, chopped
1 large carrot, chopped
1  rib of celery, chopped
8  garlic cloves, chopped
3 cup red wine
1  bouquet garni*
1 dash salt to taste
1 dash pepper to taste
1 1/2 cup stock (veal, or beef, or
1  chicken)

*Bouquet garni is one bayleaf plus spring of thyme and parsley tied
together.

In a large skillet or saute pan heat vegetable oil and brown the meat
chunks in several batches, adding more oil as needed. Do not crowd
the pan. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.

Add the vegetables and cook until lightly browned - if necessary add
more oil.  Add the red wine to the pan deglazing it by scraping up
the browned bits.  Add the bouquet garni and salt and pepper to
taste. Return the browned meat to the pan.  Simmer covered slowly for
one hour and then add the stock. Uncover the pan and increase the
heat and let reduce for 1/2 hour. Towards the end of the cooking time
remove the meat and let the liquid reduce to a sauce like
consistency. Defat the sauce and return the meat to the pan just to
reheat.

Drain meat when hot and remove to a serving dish. Strain the pan
sauce, adjust the seasonings and pour sauce over the meat.

Serve with mashed potatoes and green salad

Raspberry Borscht

soups, vegetarian

2 lb beets; or more
1  water
1 pinch salt
1 pint raspberries
1/4 cup red onion; minced
1/2 cup lemon juice, fresh
3 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
3 tablespoon sugar
1  lemon juice; to taste
1  sugar; to taste

Cut the tops off the beets, scrub them thoroughly, and put them in a
saucepan with enough water to cover them by an inch and a little
pinch of salt. Simmer the beets, covered, for 30 minutes if they're
small, closer to 45 if large. They must be tender.

Drain the beets, reserving the cooking liquid, and allow them to
cool. When you can handle them, peel them and cut them into quarters
or eighths.

Combine the beets, raspberries, red onion, and 2 cups of the reserved
cooking liquid, and puree it all in batches in a blender. Strain the
puree through a sieve to remove the raspberry seeds. Stir in 1/2 cup
of lemon juice, the balsamic vinegar, and 3 tablespoons of sugar.
Stir until the sugar is dissolved, and taste. Add more lemon juice
and more sugar only if needed, until the right sweet-sour balance is
achieved. You might need a teensy pinch of salt, but be careful.

Chill the soup in the refrigerator, and when it is completely cold,
taste it again. Correct the seasoning if necessary. Serve in chilled
bowls, with a spoonful of sour cream in the center of each one.

2 small whole codfish or
1 1/2 lb codfish fillets
1 cup milk
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1  salt
1  pepper

This is a toned-down version of the soup that Rasputin always said
gave him his health, vigor ... and virility. It was, according to his
daughter, his favorite dish. "Restaurants in Petrograd and Moscow
would prepare the concoction whenever they expected Rasputin to
dine." Paprika and minced ginger usually went into his recipe.

Clean codfish. Remove head and cut fish into fillets. Remove fish
bones. Cut fillets into 2" pieces and place in saucepan. Add milk and
whipping cream. Place over medium heat and bring to scalding
temperature. Do not boil.

Reduce heat and continue simmering until fish is done. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into soup bowls and serve hot.

Makes about 1 quart, or 4 servings.

Red Kidney Bean Soup

appetizers, lunch, vegetables

1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 medium onion, sliced
4  garlic cloves, crushed
1 medium carrot, sliced
2 tablespoon red chiles, chopped, fresh*
1/2 teaspoon thyme
2 tablespoon parsley
2  bay leaves
1/2 cup tomatoes, finely chopped
3 teaspoon tomato paste
1 cup red kidney beans, soaked
7 cup vegetable stock
1  salt & pepper
1/2 tablespoon nutritional yeast, optional+

Heat oil in a large soup pot.  Stir in the onions, garlic and carrots.
Cover & sweat over low heat for 5 minutes.  Add the chiles and herbs,
stir well & continue to cook, covered, for a further 5 minutes.  Stir
in the tomatoes, tomato paste & kidney beans.  Mix well, ensure that
the heat is very low, & cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring
occasionally.  Pour in the stock, season with salt & pepper & bring
to a boil.  When at a full rolling boil, let it boil hard for 5
minutes, then reduce the heat & simmer until the beans are tender.
The length of time will vary, depending upon the age of the beans,
from 50 minutes, to 2 hours.  When cooked, turn off the heat, stir in
the nutritional yeast, if desired & let cool.

Once cool, transfer the soup, in batches, to a food processor or
blender & blend until very smooth.  Return to a clean pot & gently
re-heat.  Serve with good, home-made bread.  It will also work with a
good, hearty flat bread, if that's not too much of a contradiction in
terms.  Try a Native flat bread, for example.

* I'm experimenting with fresh chiles rather than dry ones, I find the
flavour to be intense, but I find that I may be over doing the
quantities, so reduce the amount if you prefer less hot food.  If you
do not have fresh, a good guideline is to use dried in the following
quantities: 1 dried chile gives a mild flavour; 2 give a medium heat;
3 will be hot; then there's people like me & others who will go up
from there, depending upon taste.  The trick is to use only enough
chiles so that the other tastes are not masked.

+ This is optional.  It's another area of experimenting.  I find that
a little nutritional yeast in pureed foods, or in "cream" sauces,
gives added creaminess to dishes.  It is entirely up to the cook.

Rice & Onion Soup Base

none

2 cup onions; thinly sliced
2 tablespoon butter
8 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup white rice
1  salt and pepper to taste

In a 3-quart heavy saucepan, cook the onions in the butter over
moderately low heat for 7 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently, until
the onions are very tender and colored no more than a buttery yellow.
(This is known as "sweating the onions".) Pour in 4 cups of the
stock, stir in the rice and simmer for 20 minutes or more until the
rice is very tender. Puree the soup in the blender until very smooth
and lightly thickened, adding a little more stock if needed. Return
the puree to the pan, add the rest of the stock and season to taste
with salt and pepper.

Note: to make a fat-free version, cook the onions in a little stock
instead of butter.

Roasted Garlic Soup

soups

4  garlic heads
1/4 cup olive oil
6 tablespoon unsalted butter
4  leeks; (white part only),
1  onion; diced
6 tablespoon flour; all purpose
4 cup chicken stock; heated
1/3 cup sherry; dry
1 cup whipping cream
1  fresh lemon juice
1  salt
1  freshly ground white pepper
2 tablespoon chives; chopped fresh

Note: Leeks should be cut into pieces.
Preheat oven to 350F.  Cut off top 1/4 inch of each garlic head.
Place garlic heads in small shallow baking dish. Drizzle oil over.
Bake until golden, about 1 hour.  Cool slightly.  (I now do the same
thing with the garlic heads but I wrap the heads with oil on top of
them in aluminum foil so they don't brown so quick. There is also a
great recipe for microwaved garlic that Marge posted for me which is
great if you're pressed for time.)  Press individual garlic cloves
between thumb and finger to release garlic. Chop garlic.  Melt butter
in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic, leeks and onion
and saute until onion is translucent, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to
low. Add flour and cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in hot
stock and Sherry. Simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Cool
slightly. Puree soup in batches in blender or processor.  (Can be
prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)      Return soup to
saucepan.  Add cream and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Add
lemon juice to taste. Season with salt and white pepper.  Ladle into
bowls. Garnish with chives. From the Stein Eriksen Lodge at Deer
Valley in Park City, Utah.

Root Vegetable Soup

soups

2 large leeks white part only
4 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 1/2 tablespoon all purpose flour
6 cup homemade chicken stock
3 medium carrots peeled and cubed
3 medium turnips peeled and cubed
2 medium parsnips peeled and cubed
2 medium red potatoes peeled and
1  cubed
2  hearts of bibb lettuce
1  leaves separated and rinsed
2 cup fresh spinach leaves
1  stemmed and rinsed
1  salt and white pepper to
1  taste
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon fine minced chives
1  and parsley for garnish

Cut the leeks in half lengthwise and then crosswise into thin slices.
Place in a colander and run under warm water to remove all traces of
sand. Drain and set aside. In a large casserole, melt the butter over
low heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly for one minute
without browning. Add the chicken stock and whisk until well blended.
Add the reserved leeks, carrots, turnips, parsnips and potatoes.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables are
almost tender. Add the lettuce and spinach leaves to the soup, and
season with salt and pepper. The lettuce should just wilt, but still
remain crisp. Do not overcook. Before serving, add the heavy cream
and heat the soup through without letting it come to a boil. Transfer
the soup to a large tureen, sprinkle with chives and parsley and
serve hot with thin slices of black bread.

Seafood Gumbo

kump, seafood

8 oz andouille sausage  sliced 1-in thic; k
1/3 cup olive oil
1 lb okra; stems removed
2 cup diced onion
2 cup chopped green pepper
4  garlic cloves; minced
5 cup chicken stock
3 cup tomatoes, peeled, seeded  (diced)

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1  bay leaf
1 lb shrimp, peeled and deveined
12 oz sea scallops
1 lb lump crab meat  cartilage removed
2 tablespoon chopped parsley

Gumbo is one of those dishes which don't really suffer if an
ingredient is added or subtracted--so feel free to modify. This
specifies andouille (Cajun) sausage, but you could substitute
kielbasa or even pepperoni.

IN A LARGE POT, saute the sausage until well-browned. Remove from the
pot. Add half the oil to the pot and add the okra. Cook until soft,
about 15 minutes. Add the rest of the oil, the onion, green pepper
and garlic, and cook 10 minutes more. Add the stock, tomato and
spices. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. Add the shrimp and scallops
and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the crab meat and parsley, simmer
2-to-3 minutes and serve.

Sengalese Peanut Soup

soups

1 large onion; finely chopped
2  garlic cloves; chopped
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper; or more to taste
2 tablespoon peanut or vegetable oil
2 tablespoon curry powder; such as garam masala
3 cup chicken broth
10 medium tomatoes; cut in half crosswise, se
1  or
5 cup canned tomatoes, drained and seeded; , and chopped
2/3 cup smooth peanut butter*
1  salt and pepper
1  sour cream
1  lime wedges

*It's better to use old-fashioned peanut butter without stabilizers
to keep it from separating.

In a 4-quart pot over medium heat, cook the onion, garlic, and cayenne
pepper in the oil until the onion turns translucent, about 10
minutes. Stir in the curry powder and stir the mixture over medium
heat for 1 minute more.  Add the chicken broth and tomatoes, simmer
for 10 minutes more, and strain the soup through the fine disk of a
food mill or push it through a medium-mesh strainer with a ladle.

Bring the soup to a simmer and whisk in the peanut butter. Season
with salt and pepper and more cayenne if you want it hotter. Serve
sour cream and lime wedges at the table.

Suggestions and Variations: You can add a cup of coconut milk or heavy
cream to give this soup extra richness and a nice velvety texture. The
author adds a few tablespoons of chopped cilantro to it. If you want
to make this into a substantial main course, saute a cut-up chicken
in peanut oil, then simmer it in the soup for 15-20 minutes.

with a delicious aroma, until after services Saturday afternoon.
Shabbos means "Saturday" in Hebrew, and choulnt means "a mishmosh" in
Yiddish. (choulnt in fact comes originally from the French chaud lent
which means "warm slowly") The amount of each ingredient depends on
what taste one likes, how much is available, and the tradition handed
down by one's parents or Rebbitzin (Rabbi's wife). Yield: Serves 4-6.

*  Variations:  Some communities add some eggs (in the shell), and
lots of curry.  (in which case it is called Chamin, which means "warm
food.")

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 day cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Sharon's Minestrone

soups

2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup chopped onion
2  garlic cloves, finely chopped
6  bacon slices
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped carrots
2 cup beef stock
1 cup tomato juice
1  (14oz) can kidney beans, drained
2 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1 cup barley
2 tablespoon chopped parsley

salt and pepper to taste

In a large saucepan, saute onions and garlic in vegetable oil. In a
small frying pan, cook bacon, drain off fat and cut bacon into small
pieces. (To save a step, I cut the bacon into bite size chunks first
and then cook them in the same pot that the soup is going to be in.
Gives it a bit more flavour. Just drain off excess fat.) To the
saucepans,add bacon, celery, carrots, beef stock and tomato juice;
cook until vegetables are just tender, about 10 minutes. Add the rest
of the ingredients and cook until barley is tender, about 20-30
minutes. Serves 6-8.

TIMESAVING FOOTNOTE: I am now a firm believer in buying the "Shredded
Beef" at your supermarker butcher counter, which dispenses almost
entirely with the chopping process. Another alternative is to find a
butcher with a "chili plate" for a coarse grind.  Make sure you let
it cook at least 3 hours --6 or 12 hours is even better. Submitted By

for 35 to 40 minutes.

Melt the remaining butter in another large skillet and saut# the
carrot, onions, celery, turnip, and mushrooms until soft and lightly
browned; about 15 minutes. When the stock is ready, strain it into a
clean pot. Reserve the meat and discard the other solids. Add the
sauerkraut and cabbage, the vegetable mixture, and tomatoes to the
stock. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook, covered, over
medium-low heat for 20 minutes.

Cut the meat into bite-size pieces and add it to the soup, along with
the minced garlic.  Simmer for another five minutes. Let stand for at
least 15 minutes, and preferably a day and a night, before serving;

not the original. Here is the original.

Sheila's Vegetable Soup

soups

1  text only

Last night I made soup.  My version of a type of minestrone. I got a
package of Knorr Vegetable soup mix, put 8 cups of water and 1 can of
low sodium beef broth, defatted, brought this to a boil, then added a
sliced leek, 1/4 head of sliced cabbage, 1 stalk of sliced celery,
some alfalfa sprouts, 2/3 cups each of barley and small shell
macaroni, a little oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme and some pepper.
Simmered it for about 2 hours.  It made the best, THICK, vegetable
soup! I have a huge bowl in the freezer, and two big containers in
the fridge for lunches this week.

Shen-Hsien-T'ang (Soup For The Gods)

chinese, soups

6 cup boiling water
2 tablespoon soy sauce
1  dozen 1/2-inch sections of garlic s; hoots or
1  scallion cut into 1/8-inch sections
1/2  ounce finely chopped ginseng root
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon salt

Ran across these three short recipes utilizing ginseng. Thought
someone into herbs and/or Chinese medicinal cooking might find them
interesting. Note the measurement for "a heaping tablespoon vegetable
oil" in the last recipe.  Ginseng must be pretty miraculous stuff if
you can heap tablespoons of oil...

Put seasonings in a bowl and pour the boiling water into it. This is
a good drinking soup that goes well with a heavy dinner.

Shoko (Beef & Spinach Stew)

african, beef, main dish, soup/stew

6 small canned tomatoes -- , with
1  juice
1  whole fresh hot chile
4 medium onions -- , whole
1/4 cup green bell pepper
6 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 lb stewing beef -- , cut in
1  cubes
1 cup water [or beef broth]
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon cayenne [more or less to
1  taste]
1 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1 lb fresh spinach

1.  Reserve 1/2 cup of juice from the canned tomatoes, and discard
the rest of the juice.  Combine the chile, tomatoes, onions, and
green bell pepper in a food processor, and process until the
vegetables are minced but not pureed. 2.  Heat the oil in a large,
cast-iron pot, and saute the vegetables and beef for 5 minutes over
high heat. 3. Add the reserved tomato juice, water sugar, salt,
cayenne, and ginger. Cover, lower the heat, and simmer for 2 hours.
Stir occasionally to keep from burning. 4. Meanwhile, soak the
spinach in warm water for 15 minutes. Then rinse thoroughly,
separate, rinse again (and even a third time if you want to be extra
careful), shred coarsely, and set aside. 5. After 2 hours, add the
spinach to the pot and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes, until
the water is gone and the spinach is cooked. 6.  About half an hour
before serving, prepare boiled rice. Serve Shoko with rice. [Also

Shrimp & Scallop Chowder With Coconut Milk

seafood, soups

2 lb shrimp
1/2  scotch bonnet or other hot chili, s; eeded
4  shallots
2  cloves garlic
3  scallions
1  inch fresh ginger
1  red bell pepper
1  green bell pepper
3 tablespoon butter
2  to 3 tsp curry powder
6 cup fish stock or bottled clam broth
2 cup coconut milk
1  salt and freshly ground black peppe; r
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro for garnish

"This recipe was loosely inspired by a dish at the retaurant Al Forno
in Providence, R.I.  Curry powder, cilantro and scotch bonnet chilies
lend the chowder a West Indian accent. (Scotch bonnet are the world's
hottest chilies -- look for them at Caribbean markets. Or substitute
a milder chili, such as serrano or jalapeno.) Be sure to use
unsweetened coconut milk, which can be found canned in Indian,
Southeast Asian, and Hispanic markets."

Peel and devein the shrimp and cut into 1 inch pieces. Remove the
crescent-shaped muscle on the side of the scallops. Cut large
scallops in quarters, medium size ones in half, so that all are the
same size. Mince the chili, shallots, garlic, scallions and ginger.
Core, seed, and dice the peppers.

Melt the butter in a large saucepan.  Cook the minced and diced
vegetables over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft but not
browned. Add the curry powder and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
Add the fish stock and coconut milk and gently simmer for 5 minutes.

Just before serving, add the shrimp and scallops. Gently simmer for 2
to 3 minutes until the shellfish is firm. Correct the seasoning,
adding salt, pepper and curry powder to taste. To serve, ladle the
chowder into bowls and garnish each with chopped cilantro.

Serves 8 to 10.

Shrimp Wonton Soup

chinese, fish

      ----FILLING----
3/4 lb raw shrimp *
1/2 cup water chestnuts **
2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice wine or sake
1 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 1/2 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 1/2 tablespoon minced scallions
1  egg white lightly beaten
1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
      ----TO ASSEMBLE----
48  wonton skins
1  cornstarch for dusting
      ----TO FINISH----
4 cup homemade chicken broth
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
10 oz fresh spinach ***

* Shrimp should be shelled, deveined, rinsed and drained.
** Water Chestnuts should be plunged into boiling water and refreshed
in cold water, drained and chopped.
*** Fresh spinach should have stems removed, rinsed thoroughly and
drained.

Place the shrimp in a linen dish towel or on paper towels and
squeeze out as much moisture as possible.  Chop the shrimp to a paste
in a food processor fitted with a steel blade or by hand.  Place the
water chestnuts in a towel and squeeze out as much moisture as
possible. Place the shrimp paste, water chestnuts, soy sauce, rice
wine, sesame oil, salt, pepper, ginger, scallions and egg white in a
mixing bowl. Using your hand or a spoon, stir vigorously in one
direction to combine the ingredients evenly. Add the cornstarch and
stir to blend. The mixture should be stiff. Use a fork, teaspoon or
two chopsticks to place a scant teaspoonful of the filling in the
center of each wonton skin. Gather the edges of the skin together
around the filling and squeeze to form a "waist" and the ends shut to
enclose the filling. The finished dumpling should look like a
drawstring purse.  Place the finished dumplings on a tray that has
been lightly dusted with cornstarch.  Heat 3 quarts of water to
boiling in a large pot. Add the wontons and cover.  Once the water is
boiling again, cook for about 4 minutes or until they rise to the
surface. Remove with a long-handled strainer and drain.  Discard the
water. Heat the chicken stock, salt and sesame to boiling.  Add the
spinach and cooked wontons, portion into serving bowls.  Serve
immediately. From: Nina Simonds, The Washington Post; Jan. 29, 1992.

Silver Noodle Soup

chinese, pork

3 tablespoon peanut oil
1/3 lb pork butt or shoulder, slivered
1 tablespoon slivered fresh ginger root
2 teaspoon thin soy sauce
2 teaspoon dry sherry
1/4 cup slivered szechuan mustard green
4 cup water
2 1/2 oz (approx) bean thread noodles
1 tablespoon minced fresh coriander
4  sprigs of coriander for garnish
2 teaspoon sesame oil

Preparation:  Marinate pork and ginger in thin soy and sherry for 30
minutes.  Rinse chunk of Szechuan mustard green to remove all traces
of chili coating; sliver like pork.  The chili flavor will still be
there, but in delicate balance with the mustard and pork.  Soak
noodles in warm water for 15 minutes, then rinse and drain.

Stir-fry:  Add oil to hot wok; when it just begins to smoke, add pork
and ginger mixture.  Stir-fry 30 seconds.  Add Szechuan mustard
green; stir- fry 2 minutes.

Soup:  In 2-quart saucepan, boil the water.  Add hot pork stir-fry;
simmer 3 minutes.  Five minutes before serving, bring broth to boil,
and add soaked noodles and minced coriander.  Simmer 3 minutes or
until noodles are soft, but not pasty.  Pour into serving bowl,
garnish with coriander sprigs and sesame oil, and serve.

Sioux Berry Soup

native amer, soups

1 1/2 lb chuck steak, boned/trimmed
3 tablespoon peanut oil
1 medium white onion, peeled/sliced
2 cup beef stock (up to 3 cups)
1 cup blackberries
1 tablespoon honey
1  salt to taste

Broil the chuck steak in the oven until brown on both sides. In the
old days this would have been done over the fire, so you might wish
to quickly barbeque the meat in order to increase the flavor. Set the
meat aside to cool.

In a Dutch oven heat the oil and brown the onions. Cut the meat into
bite-size pieces and add to the pot. Add the blackberries and enough
beef stock to barely cover the meat. Stir in the honey and simmer the
meat, covered, until it is very tender, about 1 hour. If the berries
are too tart add more honey to taste. Add salt and serve in bowls.

Smith recommends servings this with Bacon Corn Bread and Hominy Baked
with Cheese.

Sizzling Rice Soup

chinese

6 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoon shredded smithfield ham
4 small cakes chinese bean curd cubed, rins; ed in cold water
6 large chinese black mushrooms  soaked, sq; ueezed dry  and shredded
4 cup peanut oil for deep-frying
      ----RICE CRUST----
1  rice
1  oil, peanut
      ----GARNISH----
1  chopped scallions
1  sesame oil

BRING THE BROTH TO A SIMMER in a pot and add the ham, bean curd and
mushrooms. Let it simmer 5 minutes. Heat the oil in a wok to very hot
(about 380F). Test the oil by dropping a small piece of Rice Crust
into it. It should float immediately. Slip the whole Rice Crust into
the oil. As it begins to puff up like popcorn, break it up into large
chunks with long chopsticks. Turn it to brown on all sides (about 1
minute). Remove the rice and drain it. At the table, add the rice to
the serving bowl of soup. It will sizzle as the steam rises and
provide quite a show. Add the scallions and sesame oil just before
serving. (The oil used for deep-frying can be cooled, strained
through a fine sieve and stored in a jar for future use.)

FOR RICE CRUST: Prepare rice as you normally would, but cook it in a
wide, heavy pot at least 15 minutes after the rice is soft so that a
crust forms on the bottom of the pot. Spoon off the top layer of
loose rice and set aside for Fried Rice or freeze it for future use.
If left to stand overnight at room temperature, the crust will be
easier to remove from the pot. To use the rice right away, keep the
pot on low heat and dribble peanut oil around the edge. Heat for a
few minutes, then loosen the crust with a spatula. It should come out
in one whole piece. Invert the crust onto a plate. It can now be
frozen for future use or used while still hot.

Sizzling Rice Soup #2 (Chicken)

appetizers, poultry, rice, soups, oriental

1 cup long grain rice
1 cup water
1  whole chicken breast
3 tablespoon cornstarch
3 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon soy sauce
6 cup chicken stock
2 cup shredded watercress, or
2 cup lettuce or spinach, shredded
1/2 cup finely chopped green onions
1 teaspoon dark sesame oil (opt)
1  salad oil for deep frying

Preparation: Skin, bone and cut the chicken breast into julienne
strips.

Rice: In a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, combine rice and water
over high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium and
cook 10 minutes. Drop heat to low and cook for an additional 30
minutes without removing the lid. The crusty rice around the sides
and bottom will stick to the pan. This will be used in the soup. Take
off the top layer of softer rice and reserve for another use. Lift
out the crusty rice and place on a cookie sheet to dry at room
temperature, or place in a glass baking dish in a microwave oven for
10 minutes on low. If the rice is dried at room temperature, allow
12-24 hours before deep frying.

Soup: Toss the strips of chicken breast with 1 tablespoon of the
cornstarch. Set aside. In a small container, combine remaining 2
tablespoons of cornstarch with water and soy sauce. Heat stock just to
boiling. Stir in soy mixture and chicken. Simmer 5 minutes. Add the
shredded greens, onions and sesame oil, if desired. Keep the soup hot
(but not boiling) while frying rice. Heat oil to 375 degrees in a
deep-fryer or heavy saucepan. Fry rice 3 to 5 minutes until puffed
and lightly browned. Be watchful, because it can burn quickly. Lift
rice out of the fat with a slotted spoon. Drain the rice on paper
towls and place in a heated tureen or individual bowls. Pour in the
soup. Serve at once. Additional fried rice may be passed during the
course.

Smoked Turkey Stock

soups, smoking

2 large onions; coarsely chopped
2 large carrots; sliced
2 tablespoon oil
2 lb smoked turkey parts; to 3 lb
3 quart water
12  peppercorns
5  whole allspice berries

More delicate than stocks made with the more traditional smoked pork
products, ths is easy to do and makes a beautifully flavored base for
soups and casseroles.

1. In a large pot saute the onions and carrots in the oil over low to
moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are a deep
golden brown and very soft.

2. Add the turkey parts, water, and seasonings. Bring to a simmer,
then cook, uncovered, over moderate heat for about 2 to 3 hours or
until the liquid is reduced by about one-third.

3. Cool slightly, then strain. Chill the strained stock overnight,
then skim off all of the fat that has congealed at the top.

Sopa De Abechuelas~ Royale~ Espesyal (The Spe

beans, soups

2 lb pork cubes
2 lb red kidney beans
1  (this works fine with
1  white kidney beans
1  and great with lentils)
4  red or white onions whole
6 large tomatoes
6 medium sized potatoes - cubes
2 large chorizo de bilbao
1  (if this is not available
1  any spanish sausage with
1  lard will do), cut into
1  thin slices
1  ham bone and/or
1/2 cup ham scraps
1 cup olive oil
1 centiliter garlic
1  vinegar
1  salt & pepper to taste

Procedure:

Soak the beans in water overnight. Drain. Put in a Large Pot
with the Pork Cubes, Onions, Tomatoes, Potatoes, Sausages the Ham
Bone and/or Ham Scraps and add water about 3/4 full. (Use a 2 Gallon
Pot or at least 1 1/2 gl. to have enough liquid in it). Bring to a
boil and once it starts to boil bring down the heat to simmer until
the beans are tender.
In a sauce pan, saute the Garlic  in Olive Oil. When Garlic is
brown add the rest of the  Olive Oil and a few halved tomatoes and
bring to a slight boil. Add this to your beans and season to taste
with Salt, Pepper and a little Vinegar. Continue to let the Beans
simmer for a few minutes before serving.
If you cannot get good and juicy tomatoes you may use 1can/450
g. of Tomato Sauce and add this to your sauted Garlic and bring to a
boil. You need not add Vinegar since the Tomato sauce normally has
vinegar already. If you are using Tomato Paste you must add a little
vinegar.
Serve hot with bread and wine. (This goes perfectly well with
Garlic Bread and Red Wine)
This can serve an army. However I prefer to take the left-over
where the beans has already soaked the sauce and the flavor of the
sausage and the ham. Just keep the leftover in your Frig and re-heat
before serving. You may opt to let the whole dish cool down and store
in your refrigerator for a day or two. Reheat it and serve hot.
I have never bothered to look at the calorie count of this dish
but I suppose it is very high. But then there is always a price for
good food. Have a happy meal! DDD ED MONTALVAN

Sopa De Ajo Con Huevos - Garlic Soup With Egg

soups

1  stephen ceideburg
2 tablespoon oil
6  sliced onions
10  or more cloves garlic finely choppe; d
2 liter water or chicken stock
4 slice thick bread

From Colombia in South America, this robust soup is just about a meal
in itself on a cold night and easily rivals its better known cousin,
French onion soup.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan and gently fry 6 sliced
onions. Add 10 or more cloves of garlic, finely chopped, and continue
cooking until the onion is transparent. Pour in 2 L water or chicken
stock and simmer, covered, for half an hour. Put 4 thick slices of
coarse bread in the bottom of four large soup bowls. When the soup is
cooked, season it to taste, then break four eggs into the simmering
liquid and poach until barely set. Using a slotted spoon, lift the
eggs out onto the bread slices, then ladle the soup over the top.
Serve very hot.

3  carrots

4 pint water
1 slice pumpkin
4 oz unsmoked bacon -or-
4 teaspoon olive oil

Soak the beans for a few hours; fill a large pan with 4 pt cold water,
press the cloves into the onion, as if their were pins, and add to
the pan with the beans. (resist the temptation to use canned beans;
it's worth the extra trouble). Add the bacon cut into small pieces.
When the beans are tender add the turnip cut into small cubes, the
carrots sliced thinly and the pumpkin slice cut into large cubes.
Discard the onion. When the carrots are almost cooked add the potato,
peeled and cut into small cubes, the washed leaves of the turnip
broken into medium size pieces by hand, and the leaves of the cabbage
hand-shred into large pieces. Let everything cook together for a
while, until soft. Place a teaspoon of vinegar in each bowl, and fill
with the hot soup. Some soup lovers will add a dash of piri-piri
sauce, or of Tabasco. The soup will taste even better if you boil a
ham bone with the beans. If there is any meat left in the bone shred
it and add to the soup. Discard the bone. (How obvious can I get?) <G>

Sopa De Frijol Negro (Black Bean Soup)

soup/stew, cuba

1 lb dried black beans
2 quart cold water
2 cup coarsely chopped onion
1/2 cup coarsely chopped scallions, includi; ng green tops
3 medium cloves garlic, minced
1 each smoked ham hock
2 each bay leaves, crumbled
1  salt to taste
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 each scotch bonnet-type chile, seeded
1/2 cup dark rum

Pick over the beans, rinse them, and put them in a large heavy pot
with the water. Cover the pot and bring the water quickly to a boil.
Stir the beans, remove them from the heat, and allow them to sit for
1 hour. When the beans have softened, return the pot to the heat,
adding more boiling water if necessary. Then add the remaining
ingredients, with the exception of the rum. Continue to cook,
covered, over low heat for several hours, until the beans are very
tender and the ham falls off its bone. Remove from the heat and
remove the ham hock bone and meat. Dice the meat finely and discard
the bone. Press the remaining ingredients through a food mill, taste
for seasoning, and add the diced ham. At this point, the soup can rest
overnight in the refrigerator so that the flavors mingle, or it can be
served at once. To serve, reheat the soup for 5 minutes while
stirring in the rum. Side dishes of lemon wedges, cooked white rice,
minced onion, or chopped hard-boiled eggs can be served as garnishes.

1 pkg sliced cactus (33 oz)**
2 tablespoon lime juice
2 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves,minced
2 oz panela/feta cheese,crumbled

Cactus looks forbidding. Stripped of its prickly points, however, it
is a mild-mannered vegetable with a slightly tart flavor. Look for
easy-to-use canned cactus (sold as NOPALES or NOPALITOS) in
supermarkets and Mexican groceries.

* - husks removed, rinsed and coarsely chopped

** - packed in water, drained and rinsed.

In a 4-5 quart pan over medium heat, stir oil and onion often until
onion is golden, about 15 minutes. Add tomatillos; stir often just
until soft, about 6 minutes. Add broth; bring to a boil over high
heat. Stir in cactus, lime juice, and cilantro. Cook until hot. Ladle
soup into a tureen. Offer cheese to add to taste. Accompany with lime
wedges.

1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 dash chilli powder
2  egg yolks
1/2 cup cream

This soup can be served hot or cold. It is important not to cook the
avocado for any length of time because it can develop a bitter

Remove chicken giblets, set aside.  Pull off and discard lumps of fat
from chicken.  Cut off wings and leg-and-thigh pieces. Separate back
from breast.

Pour oil into 6 quart kettle and place over medium heat. Add garlic,
onion, and ginger and cook, stirring until onion is soft. Add lemon
grass, galangal, tumeric, salt, coriander, sugar, pepper, broth, and
water. Stir then add chicken and giblets (except liver). Bring to a
boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until breast is
no longer pink when slashed (15-20 minutes).

Remove breast and let cool. Simmer remaining chicken until meat near
thighbone is no longer pink when slashed (15 minutes more). Lift out
legs and thighs, let cool. Continue to simmer broth. Discard skin
from breast, legs and thighs. Cut meat into bite-sized pieces. Cover
and set aside.

Return bones to broth, continue simmering until broth is richly
flavored (about 1 more hour). Strain, discard wings, back, bones,
giblets, and seasonings. (At this point you may cover and refrigerate
chicken and broth until next day.  Bring chicken to room temperature
before serving.)

Prepare condiments and crisp-fried onions.  Place condiments, onions
and chicken in seperate bowls. Skim and discard fat from broth. Heat
broth until steaming and stir in lemon juice. Ladle broth into
serving bowls. Let diners add chicken, condiments and crisp-fried
onions.

CONDIMENTS:  Offer at least two of the following: 2 ounces bean
threads, cut into 6-inch lengths (soak in warm water to cover for 30
minutes before cutting), or 1 1/2 cups cooked rice; 1 1/2 cups bean
sprouts mixed with 1/4 cup chopped celery leaves; Spiced Coconut; and
Chili Paste.

Crisp-fried onions: Cut 2 medium onions in half lengthwise. Cut each
half crosswise into even slices about 1/8 inch thick; then cut slices
into halves or thirds to make smaller arcs. Into a deep heavy pan
pour salad oil to a depth of 1 inch and heat to 300 F. Add about a
third of the onions and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned
(4-5 minutes). Oil temperature will drop at first, but rise again as
the onions brown; regulate heat to maintain 300 F.  Remove onions
with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining
onions. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.

6 centiliter garlic (opt.) or to taste
1  coarse salt
3 each eggs
2 each lemons, juice only
1  pepper to taste
1  vinegar (opt.)
1  oil (opt.)

Clean, scrape, and wash the tripe and feet.  Scald in boiling
water; cool.  Cut the tripe into small pieces, place in a large pot
with the feet, cover with plenty of water; bring to a boil, skimming
off the froth as it rises.  Lower the heat.  Add the garlic, and cook
at a slow boil for 1 to 2 hrs., adding a little coarse salt just
before the meat is tender. Remove the pot from the heat; strain the
broth and reserve. Remove and discard the bones from the feet; cut
the meat into 3 or 4 pcs.; return to the broth.

Prepare the avgolemono as follows:  Beat the eggs very well.
Slowly add the lemon juice to them, beating all the while. Add a
little hot broth from the pot, stirring constatly, then pour the
mixture back into the soup. Add pepper just before serving.

NOTE:  This soup, very light in color, can be served not only hot
but cold.  For the latter, let it jell, then cut into squares or
diamonds for serving. When it is served hot, some people prefer it
mixed with oil and vinegar, instead in avgolemono.

In a heavy saucepan, combine the chicken and water, bring to a boil,

fat that has accumulated at the top of the stock) and the evaporated
skim milk. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and the
cornstarch. Add to the soup, stirring until thickened and heated
through. Add the cooked rice, shredded chicken and thyme, stirring
until thick and bubbly. Serve at once.

will fall apart.

Sour Lentil Soup

soup/stew

1/2 liter brown lentils
2 liter water
1/4 liter finely chopped spring onions
1  garlic clove (opt.); crushed
1/2 deciliter finely chopped coriander *
3/4 deciliter olive oil
1/2 deciliter cold water
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 deciliter vinegar (or to taste)
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper

*Note: Finely chopped parsley may be substituted for coriander leaves.

Wash lentils in several changes of cold water, or place in a sieve
and run water through them.  Drain.

Put lentils in a large pot with 8 cups water, spring onion, garlic if
used, oil and coriander or parsley (or a combination of the two if
preferred). Bring to the boil, cover pan and simmer on low heat for 1
hour or until lentils are soft.

Put water and flour in a screw top jar, seal and shake until
thoroughly combined.  This prevents lumps forming. Pour this
gradually into boiling soup, stirring constantly, until thickened
slightly. Add vinegar and salt and pepper to taste.  Return to the
boil, boil gently for 5 minutes, then serve hot.

5  dried black mushrooms
15  pieces cloud ear fungus
30  pieces dried lily flower
6 cup chicken stock
1 cup mushroom liquid
6 tablespoon clear rice vinegar
3 tablespoon thin soy
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 lb lean pork
1 teaspoon dry sherry or rice wine
1 teaspoon thin soy
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1  cornstarch to coat
1/2 cup shredded bamboo
2  cakes bean curd, shredded
2 tablespoon peanut oil
4 tablespoon cornstarch (mixed as paste with
5 tablespoon cold stock or water)
2  eggs, beaten
4  scallions, diced
1/4 cup sesame oil

Preparation:  Soak mushrooms, cloud ear, and lily flowers separately

liquid in amount specified above.  Next remove stems from mushrooms;
discard. Pick off tough ends of cloud ear; discard ends; coarse chop
cloud ear. Remove tough ends of lily flowers; cut flowers in half.

cornstarch and mix again to coat evenly. Slice bean curd in thirds,
cut each slice in half, then cut each half into shreds.

Mix up cornstarch paste with cornstarch and stock or water; set aside.

Combine stock, mushroom liquid, vinegar, soy and black pepper. Bring
to simmer; add shredded bean curd; mix with chopsticks to keep bean
curd from sticking together. Simmer for 2 minutes.

While stock is simmering, heat wok and add peanut oil. Heat oil for 10
seconds; then add shredded pork; stir vigorously with spatulas until
pork loses its brown color and turns white. At this point, add
mushrooms, cloud ear, lily flower and bamboo.  Stir for 15 seconds
over high heat; add to stock.

Bring stock back to simmer and slowly thicken with cornstarch mixture,
adding a little at a time until desired thickness is reached. Remove
from heat and slowly add beaten egg, dripping and folding a little at
a time. Top soup with diced scallions and sesame oil. Serve

Southern French Vegetable Soup (Soupe Au Pist

french, soups

      ----THE SOUP----
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2  leeks; washed, white and tender
1 large onion; coarsely chopped
3 medium carrots; chopped
1 cup dried white beans; (navy or canellini), soak
4 medium zucchini; cut into 1/4-inch slices
2 quart chicken or vegetable broth
1  or water
1  bouquet garni*
1 cup miniature dried macaroni; ditalini or other small p
1/2 lb green beans; preferably small french t
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  slices of french bread; toasted
      ----THE PISTOU----
8  garlic cloves; peeled
2 large bunches fresh basil; stems removed, 2 cups tig
2 teaspoon coarse salt
2 cup parmesan cheese; finely grated
2 medium tomatoes; peeled, seeded, and coars
1 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil

*A bouquet garni is a small bundle of herbs that are tied with a
string or placed in cheesecloth so the herbs do not fall apart or
float around in the soup. A traditional bouquet garni contains only
thyme, parsley, and bay leaves.  It is best made with fresh herbs and
tied in a bundle with a short piece of string. Use about 8-10 thyme
sprigs, 1 large bunch of parsley, 1 bay leaf.  If you don't have
fresh thyme use 1 tsp. dried thyme.

To make the soup base, heat the olive oil in a 4-quart pot over medium
heat.  Add leeks, onion, and carrots. Stir until the leeks and onion
turn translucent about 10 minutes. Add beans, zucchini broth, and
bouquet garni. Bring the soup to a boil, then simmer on low heat for
about 5 minutes, and add the pasta and green beans. Continue
simmering for about 10 minutes until the vegetables and macaroni have
softened. Don't season the soup until you've added the pistou, which
is very salty. If you're not serving the soup right away, chill it as
quickly as you can so the vegetables don't overcook.

PISTOU:  Put the tomatoes and then the rest of the ingredients except
the olive oil in the blender.  (The tomatoes go in first to provide
liquid to get the mixture moving around.) Blend at high speed for
about 1 minute, until the mixture turns into a paste. Transfer the
pistou to a mixing bowl and stir in the olive oil. (The olive oil
must be added by hand, or it will turn bitter.)

At the Last Minute:  To serve, whisk half of the pistou into the hot
soup, then season with salt if needed and pepper. Immediately ladle
the soup into hot bowls.  Serve the French bread toasts in a basket.
Pass the remaining pistou at the table in a bowl and let guests help
themselves. Source: Splendid Soups by James Peterson.

bacon and drain on paper towels; when it is cool, chop or crumble it.
Add the onion and garlic to the fat remaining in the pot; saute over
medium-high heat until quite soft, about 10 minutes. Add the sweet
potatoes with the cooking liquid to the onion and stir in the
remaining 3 cups broth as well.

Add the creamed corn and green chiles to the soup and season with the
chili powder and cayenne.  Gradually stir in the milk and cream.
Simmer the soup, uncovered, for 10 minutes.

Shred 12 ounces of the cheese and cut the remaining 4 ounces into
small dice.  Reduce the heat under the soup to low and add the
shredded cheese, stirring just until melted. Season the soup with
salt and stir in the cilantro.  Ladle into bowls, stirring a
tablespoon of diced cheese into each.

Speedy Gazpacho

low cal, vegetables, soup/stew

      ----BDGM08B----
32 oz v-8 juice
1  green peper, seeded/chopped
1 teaspoon instant beef bouillon
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon onion salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1  cucumber, seeded/chopped
3  stalks celery, seed/chopped
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup curried mayo or sour cream

While this is low-cal, those of you in sunnier climates may find
this great recipe easier to enjoy these days...but I still like it
after (if and when) I come back from the health club, which I promise
to do much more often, starting next Monday! Whilrl all ingredients
in a blender of food processor ~ I like to keep them a little
"chunky", but adjust to your personal preference.  You may need to
process two batches to avoid overflow.   Pour mixture into large
pitcher; refrigerate, or add 6-7 ice cubes to hasten chilling. Serve
with a dollop of curried mayonnaise or sour cream, if your calorie
counter can handle it!

Spiced Red Wine Fruit Soup With Candied Orang

soups, fruits/nuts, desserts

      ----FRUITS----
1 small pineapple
8 small thin-skinned seedless
1  oranges or tangerines
1 1/4 cup sugar, approximately
1  half a vanilla bean, split
1  star anise pod
2 tablespoon orange liqueur
3 medium pears, such as bartlett
4 cup dry red wine
      ----BOUQUET GARNI----
12  fresh mint leaves or
2 teaspoon high-quality peppermint tea leaves
1  cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon cardamon seeds
      ----TO FINISH----
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 cup creme fraiche
1/4 cup heavy cream (approximately)
1  fresh mint leaves, garnish

1.  Using a large sharp knife, trim off the top and bottom of the
pineapple and slice off the skin.  Using the tip of a vegetable
peeler, remove the eyes. Quarter the pineapple lengthwise and core
it. Slice each quarter crosswise 1/2" thick, then cut enough slices
into bite-sized pieces to make 1 cup.  Reserve balance of the
pineapple for another use. 2. In a large saucepan of simmering water,
scald the oranges for 5 seconds. Refresh under cold running water;
pat dry. Pick out the orange with the nicest skin. Using a sharp
knife, cut it crosswise into very thin slices; save any juices.
Using a vegetable peeler, strip the zest from 3 of the remaining
oranges; cut it into very thin strips; set aside. 3. Juice the 3
zested oranges. Add enough water to make 1 1/4 cups and pour into a
medium nonreactive saucepan.  Stir in the 1 1/4 cups suage and the
orange slices and their juices.  Scrape the seeds out of the vanilla
bean with the tip of a knife and set aside. Add the bean and star
anise pod to the saucepan and bring to a simmer over high heat,
stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cover, reduce the heat to low and
simmer very gently until the white of the orange slices begins to
turn translucent and the syrup takes on a rich amber color, about 1
hour.  Add a few tablespoons of water if the syrup thickens too much
before the slices are translucent. Strain the syrup and add enough
water to make 3/4 cup.  Reserve the orange slices; discard the star
anise and the vanilla bean. 4. While the orange slices are cooking,
using a small sharp knife, peel the remaining 4 oranges, removing all
the bitter white pith.  Working over a nonreactive bowl, cut in
between the membranes to release the orange sections. Squeeze the
membranes to extract all the juice.  Add the cut pineapple and orange
liqueur. Set aside to macerate until ready to assemble the soup. 5.
Peel, halve and core the pears. Slice them crosswise 1/3-inch thick.
6. In another medium nonreactive saucepan, boil the red wine over
high heat until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, about 12 minutes.  Stir in the
reserved orange syrup and orange zest and the bouquet garni (tie all
ingredients in the listing for the bouquet garnet in cheesecloth
before using). Bring to a simmer over moderately low heat. Add the
pears and poach until wine-colored and tender when pierced with a
knife, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfers the pears
to a plate to cool. 7. If desired, add another teaspoon or so of
sugar to the wine mixture. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons
of water and whisk into wine. Return to a boil over high heat; boil
for 1 minute to thicken. Pour the soup into another nonreactive
container; let cool slightly; then cool completely in refrigerator.
Squeeze the bouquet garni gently; discard. 8.  In a food processor,
puree the reserved candied orange slices and vanilla bean seeds.  Add
the creme fraiche and blend. Thin with the heavy cream to a
semi-liquid consistency. 9. To assemble the soup: Place the poached
pear slices in chilled shallow bowls or rimmed soup plates. Scatter
the orange sections and pineapple pieces evenly on top. Ladle 1/4-cup
of the soup over each serving. Place a dollop of the creme fraiche
mixture in the center of each bowl and garnish with a mint leaf.
Makes 6-8 servings. NOTE:  If you buy organic oranges or tangerines,
you don't need to follow the scalding procedure in Step 2.

Spicy & Sour Shrimp Soup

fish

1  stephen ceideburg
2 oz lump tamarind, or 2
1  tablespoons tamarind
1  concentrate
1/2 cup boiling water
8 oz raw shrimp, shelled and
1  deveined
2  garlic cloves, chopped
1/4 cup plus 1 ts nuoc mam
1  (vietnamese fish sauce)
1  freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2  shallots, thinly sliced
3  stalks fresh lemon grass,
1  white bulb crushed and cut
1  into 2-inch sections
1 large ripe tomato, cored, seeded
1  and cut into wedges
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4  fresh ripe pineapple, cored,
1  cut into 1/4-inch slices
1  and then cut crosswise into
1  small chunks
1/2 cup fresh or canned bamboo
1  shoots, drained and thinly
1  sliced
1 teaspoon salt
2  fresh red chili peppers,
1  minced
1/2 cup fresh bean sprouts
1  scallion, thinly sliced
2 tablespoon shredded mint

This soup has become a staple on my table.  It's
relatively quick to make and absolutely delicious.
I've made it with chicken as well as shrimp and have
some red snapper in the freezer to try out the next
time. Squid's a natural for this dish.  It's from
Southern Vietnam. You can make it as sour or spicy as
you want by juggling the amounts of the ingredients
that give those qualities.  It makes a complete meal
as is and is excellent with salad rolls or cha gio
(fried "spring" rolls).

Soak the lump tamarind in the boiling water for 15
minutes, or until the tamarind is soft.  Force the
tamarind through a fine sieve into a small bowl.  If
tamarind concentrate is used, dilute it with only 1/4
cup of warm water. Cut each shrimp lengthwise in half.
In a bowl, combine the shrimp, garlic, 1 teaspoon of
the fish sauce and pepper to taste. Let stand for 30
minutes. Heat the oil in a 3-quart saucepan. Add the
shallots and lemon grass and saute briefly, without
browning. Add the tomato and sugar and cook over
moderate heat until slightly soft. Add the pineapple
and bamboo shoots and cook, stirring, for about 2
minutes. Add 5 cups of water and bring to a boil over
high heat. Stir in the tamarind liquid, salt and the
remaining 1/4 cup fish sauce. Reduce the heat to
moderate and simmer the broth for 5 minutes. Stir in
the shrimp, chiles and bean sprouts and cook for 30
seconds more. Add the scallion and mint. Remove from
the heat. Remove and discard the lemon grass. Ladle
the soup into a heated tureen and serve at once. Note:
Do not overcook the shrimp or they will toughen.
Catfish, red snapper or any other firm white-fleshed
fish can replace the shrimp. From "The Foods of
Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart, Tabori & Chang.
1989.

NOTE:  I've been pushing Vietnamese cuisine long
enough here that the ingredients shouldn't be too
unfamiliar to regulars.  Some of this stuff will
probably have to come from an Asian market, but you
can make some substitutions. Tamarind is made from the
interior pulp of a tree seed pod and is quite sour. It
has a subtly sweet taste too. I've never done it, but
I imagine that you could substitute lemon juice for
the tamarind and still retain the essential character
of the soup. Lemon grass can be replaced by grated
lemon zest with a bit of juice--it's the lemon taste
rather than the sourness that's wanted here. Dried
lemon grass is available and is virtually as good as
the fresh stuff. It's inexpensive and keeps well on
the shelf.  (I grow my own lemon grass--it's a really
easy and pest free plant to grow. If you manage to
find some fresh lemon grass, whack off the bottom
couple of inches and stick it in a flower pot full of
good potting soil.  Don't water the cutting too
heavily until it starts to grow. Chances are that it
will take off and then you can transplant it into the
ground--it likes rich, well drained soil and full
sun.) There's NO substitute for fish sauce.  The soup
would probably be good without it, but it wouldn't be
the same. Since there's not that much difference
between canned and fresh pineapple (at least here on
the mainland) I use canned stuff, drained and chopped.
If you're ever in a market and see fresh Thai
pineapple, grab some. The stuff I had in Thailand made
our Hawaiian pineapples pale in comparison.

Spicy Chicken Coconut Soup

poultry

1  stephen ceideburg
2  chicken breast halves
1/2 cup slivered fresh lemon, with peel
3 tablespoon fish sauce
1 1/2 teaspoon chopped hot chile pepper, or to tas; te
2  green onions, thinly sliced, includ; ing part of green top
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
4 cup unsweetened coconut milk
2 cup chicken stock
3 teaspoon minced lemon grass or 1 teaspoon gr; ated lemon zest
1 cup whole straw mushrooms
1 tablespoon slivered galangal root or ginger ro; ot

[I prefer galangal--even dried, to ginger, but ginger
will do.  S.C.]

Place chicken breasts in pan with just enough cold
water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium heat;
immediately reduce heat so water barely ripples.
Simmer uncovered, until done, about 12 minutes.  Meat
should be moist and opaque throughout; cook only to
just beyond pink stage. Remove breasts and drain well.
Cool to room temperature; remove and discard skin and
bones. Shred meat into bite-sized pieces. Reserve.
Combine slivered lemon, fish sauce, chile pepper,
green onion and sugar; set aside. Combine coconut
milk, chicken stock, lemon grass, mushrooms and
galangal in a sauce pan over medium-high heat. Bring
to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until
lemon grass is tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Add
reserved chicken and lemon mixture and heat through,
about 3 minutes.

Serves 6 to 8 as a first course or 4 as a main course.

Spicy Leek Soup With Sage & Parsley (Sweet

soups

1 tablespoon unsalted butter -- or
1  margarine
2 tablespoon virgin olive oil
3 large leeks -- thinly sliced
1/4 cup minced shallots
1 lb sweet potatoes -- peeled and
1  diced
3 cup vegetable broth
1 tablespoon fresh sage -- minced
2 tablespoon fresh flat-leaf parsley --
1  chopped
1 pinch red pepper -- dried or fresh
1  hot
1 cup skim milk
1/2 cup shredded monterey jack
1  cheese
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
1  optional garnish:
1  fresh parsley
1  fresh nasturtium flowers
1  fresh calendula petals
1  pecan pieces
1  shredded carrot
1  bell pepper -- not green
1  shallots

LEEKS: Use both the white and tender green parts. To make sure you
get all the soil out of the leeks, slice them in half lengthwise,
then take the leaves out one by one and wash thoroughly. Then
re-align to make slicing easier.

In a large saucepan, heat the butter and oil over medium heat, then
add the leeks and shallots and cook, stirring, until soft and
translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the sweet potatoes, broth (or
water and/or bouillon), sage, parsley, and hot pepper (1 small fresh
or dried hot red pepper or use flakes).

Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the
potatoes are tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.

Remove the (whole) hot pepper, if using.

In a food processor or blender, puree the soup in batches. (Or use
immersion blender.)

Return to the saucepan and stir in the milk. Heat just to a simmer,
then stir in the cheese until melted, reserve some for garnish.
Remove from the heat and add salt and pepper, to taste. Serve with
color garnishes.

Garnish:  mix the white cheese with brown nuts and/or shallots and
sprinkle in the center. Surround that with green parsley. Or streak
parsley along one side and yellow/orange vegetation on the other.

Spicy Soup Of Tangerine & Coconut

soups, vegetables

2 cup water
1 cup long-grain white rice
1 can (14oz) coconut milk

1/2 cup tangerine juice
1  (about 2 1/2 tangerines)
1 tablespoon tangerine zest,

1  (about 2 tangerines)
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon thai chili paste
2 each thai chili peppers - or serrano chi; lies - stemmed and seeded
2 cup mushrooms, quartered
1/2 cup wood ear mushrooms, chopped
1/2 cup basil, chopped
1  salt and pepper

In a saucepan, bring the water to a full boil. Add the rice and boil

stock, tangerine juice and zest, fish sauce, chili paste, and chili
peppers. Bring to a full boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer

no more than 10 min. Remove from the heat and stir in the basil.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.

To serve, divide the rice among 6 individual bowls and spoon the soup
over the top. Serve immediately.

Note: experiment with adding other ingredients, such as shrimp or
fresh artichoke hearts.

Spicy Vegetable Soup

appetizers, lunch, vegetables

      ----SOUP----
1  3 cinnamon stick
6  cloves
4  black cardamom pods
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
2  garlic cloves, chopped
1  2 piece ginger, grated
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 cup potatoes, cubed
1 cup carrots, diced
1/2 cup green bell pepper
6 cup stock
      ----SEASONING----
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds, whole
1  dried red chile, chopped
1  salt
2 tablespoon cilantro, chopped

Using a mortar & pestle, crush the cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom
pods & peppercorns.  Set aside.  In a soup pot, combine all the soup
ingredients with the crushed spices.  Bring to a boil, reduce the
heat & simmer, covered, until the vegetables are very tender, about
25 to 35 minutes. Remove from the heat & cool for 10 minutes.

In batches if necessary, puree the stock & vegetables in a blender or
food processor.  Return to a clean pot & reheat gently.

For the seasoning, warm the olive oil in a small skillet over medium
heat. When hot, put in the mustard seeds.  After a few seconds, they
should pop. Add the cumin seeds & dried red chile & remove from the
heat.  Add this mixture to the soup pot.  Stir in the cilantro &
salt.  Check the seasoning & serve hot.

NOTE: If you cannot find cilantro, use parsley.  Use whatever
vegetables you like.

A couple of tablespoons of nuts cooked with the vegetables adds some
creaminess to the soup.

Spinatsuppe (Spinach Soup)

vegetables, soup/stew, norwegian

2 lb spinach; fresh -=or=-
2 pkg frozen chopped spinach
2 quart chicken stock; fresh or canned
3 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
2  eggs; hard-cooked & sliced

Wash the fresh spinach thoroughly under cold running water to remove
any sand. Drain by shaking it vigorously by hand or in a lettuce
basket, then chop coarsely. If frozen spinach is used, thoroughly
defrost and drain it. Bring 2 quarts of chicken stock to a boil in a
3-4 quart saucepan and add the fresh or frozen chopped spinach.
Simmer uncovered about 6 to 8 minutes, then pour the entire contents
of the pan into a sieve set over a large bowl. Press down hard on the
spinach with the back of a wooden spoon to extract all it's juices.
Set the liquid aside in the bowl and chop the cooked spinach very
fine. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in the saucepan. When the foam
subsides, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the flour. With a
wire whisk, beat the hot stock into this white roux a little at a
time. Return the saucepan to the heat and, stirring it constantly,
bring it to the boil. Then add the spinach. Season soup with salt,
pepper and nutmeg. Half cover the pan and simmer soup over low heat
about 5 minutes longer. Stir occasionally. Garnish each serving of
soup with a few slices of hard-cooked egg. On festive occasions, such
as Easter, spinatsuppe is often served with a stuffed egg half
floating in each soup bowl. To make these, remove the yolks from 2 or
3 hard-cooked eggs (depending on how many people you plan to serve)
and mash them to a paste with about 1 to 2 teaspoons of softened
butter. Roll the mixture into little balls and nestle 2 or 3 into
each halved egg white.

1  large onion,chopped
1/2 lb boned lamb shoulder or neck*
2  garlic cloves,chopped
1  large dried bay leaf
7 cup chicken broth

* - cut into 1/2" chunks


1. Sort peas, discarding any debris. Rinse peas; drain, and set

2. In a 5-6 quart pan over high heat, combine celery, onion, lamb,
garlic, bay leaf, and 1/2 cup water. Cover and simmer rapidly for 10

the next day.) Transfer 3 cups soup (but no meat) to a blender or
food processor. Whirl until smoothly pureed. Return to pan. For
thinner soup, add more broth. Stir on high heat until hot.

soups, vegetarian

8 cup water
2 1/4 cup split peas, dried
1 medium onion
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2  carrots, chopped
2  celery, chopped

1 lb. of dried split peas = approx. 2 1/4 cups

Heat water and peas to boiling.  Boil for 2 minutes, then remove from
heat and cover.  Let sit for 1 hour.

Add ham (whole), onion, salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer until peas
are tender, about 1 hour.

Remove ham and trim meat from bone.  (I usually use 1 lb boneless
smoked ham) Cut ham to 1/2 inch pieces. Stir ham, carrots, and celery
into soup. Cover and simmer until veggies are tender, about 45
minutes.

Like I said, it freezes well and is a very convenient side to a
sandwich or whatever.

Split Pea Soup I

beans

2 cup dried split peas
3 quart cold water
1  ham bone or
1  small shank end of ham
1 large onion, minced
3  stalks celery, with tops,
1  chopped fine
1  sprig of parsley
1  thicken, if desired, with:
3 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon flour
1  dilute as desired with:
1  milk or water
1  season to taste with:
1  salt
1  pepper

Place together in kettle -(soaked overnight): dried split peas,
water, ham bone and onion.  Then add celery, parsley.

Bring slowly to boiling point.  Cover and simmer 4 to 5 hours until
beans or peas are tender and the liquid partially cooked down. For
smooth soup, rub through a coarse sieve. Some prefer leaving some of
the beans or peas whole. Skim off excess fat. Serve hot. Thicken if
desired.

Quick-cooking dried peas and beans do not *require* overnight
soaking. Some people, however, believe even those are *better* for
soaking.  Others prefer the old-fashioned type. If you prefer to soak
beans or peas, measure the amount of water specified in these
recipes. Leave the beans or peas in it overnight. Next morning, add
the remaining ingredients. No draining is necessary.

2 c peas or beans equals one -pound.

precook squash without peeling, cut in half, remove pulp and bake,
cut side down, in a baking dish with enough water to cover the bottom
until tender, about 45 minutes at 375 degrees. Check occasionally to
see if more water is needed. Then scrap pulp off the skin.

Stewed Tomatoes With Potato Peasant Purses

cyberealm, main dish, stews

1  stewed tomatoes
1 medium yellow onion
1 small red or yellow pepper
1  stalk celery
2 tablespoon canola oil
3 lb ripe tomatoes, coarsely chop
7  sprigs fresh parsley
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1  juice of 2 lemons
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1  peasant purses
6 large cabbage leaves (savoy)
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
1/3 cup butter
1/2 cup english peas
2 tablespoon water
3 cup mashed potatoes
2  eggs, lightly beaten
1  salt and pepper to taste
12  green chives

Chop the onion, bell pepper and celery into 1/2 inch pieces.  In a
large stainless steel pot, saute the vegetables in the oil over
medium heat until translucent.  Peel, seed and chop the tomatoes (I
just core them and put them in the blender so we get the vitamins
from the skins). Add tomatoes and parsley to the vegetables and cook
covered over low heat for 20 minutes.  Remove parsley sprigs.  Season
with 1/4 cup brown sugar, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Cook for 10
minutes longer and taste for seasoning.  Add more sugar or salt, to
taste. Keep warm until ready to serve.  (At this point, I added a
small amount of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.)

In a 2-quart pot of boiling water, blanch the cabbage leaves until
wilted; drain and cool.  In a saute pan over medium heat, sweat the
onion in butter.  Add peas and water, cover for 2-3 minutes.  Remove
cover and cool slightly.  Meanwhile, in a large bowl, blend the
mashed potatoes with eggs. Stir in the onion and pea mixture.  Salt
and pepper generously. Flatten a cabbage leaf, cutting out any thick,
unpliable stem. Place a generous 1/2 cup of potato mixture in the
center of two leaves laid to overlap. Pull the leaves together,
forming a pouch and tie with 2 chives. Just before serving, reheat
the pouches for approximately 15 minutes in a steamer or a shallow
pan of boiling water. Place each pouch on a plate covered with the
warm stewed tomatoes.

These purses go nicely with grilled English-style sausages or
bratwurst. A sprinkling of grated cheddar cheese on top is a perfect
complement to this dish.  The flavors of the potatoes, cabbage and
stewed tomatoes are as rustic as the presentation of this dish.

Summer Asparagus Soup

soups

2 tablespoon butter
1  onion, chopped
1 1/2 lb asparagus, fresh
2 tablespoon flour
6 cup water, boiling
2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup chicken broth, rich (optional)
2  egg yolks
1/2 cup milk

Melt the butter in a pan big enough to cook the soup. Saute the
onions for a few minutes, until transparent but not brown.

Meanwhile, slice the asparagus into thin slices.  Now add the sliced
asparagus pieces to the onions and continue to saute (over medium to
medium-high heat) for 15 minutes, until most of the moisture has
steamed out of the asparagus and the mixture has just barely started
to brown.

Add the flour to the onion/asparagus mixture and stir well to coat
each piece with some flour. Cook for 2 or 3 more minutes over
medium-high heat. Dump the boiling water into the asparagus mixture.
Add the (optional) chicken broth and the salt. Simmer for 1 hour.

Strain out the cooked asparagus, leaving behind a thin yellow-green
soup. Thicken the soup with the 2 egg yolks. Add the milk and reheat
the soup to serving temperature. Add salt and fresh-ground white
pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

NOTES:

*  A light and simple asparagus soup -- Every summer, it seems, the
grocery stores are glutted with cheap asparagus. Most of the
classical recipes for asparagus soup produce a hearty winter-style
soup. Here's a simple recipe for a delicious, light, thin soup that
is more in keeping with the time of the year that the glut occurs.
You can leave out the chicken broth to make it a meatless soup, but
it does require egg yolks. Yield: Serves 4-6.

*  The slicing disk on a food processor does an excellent job of
slicing the asparagus for this recipe. You can use a food mill, a
china cap, or an ordinary sieve to strain the cooked asparagus out of
the broth.

*  Don't try to make this soup as a low-salt soup by leaving out the
salt.
It will taste like dishwater if you cook the asparagus for an hour
without salt. Don't try to skimp on time by leaving the cooked
asparagus in the broth unstrained. It will ruin the texture.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate (thickening soup with egg yolks is
not a beginner's skill).
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour simmering, 5 minutes
finishing. : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

Summer Sweet Pea Soup

soups

2 tablespoon butter or low-fat butter substitute
1 cup coarsely chopped onions
4 cup defatted chicken broth
2 pkg frozen peas, defrosted (10 oz ea)
1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh mint leaves
1/2 cup heavy cream
1  salt to taste
1  white pepper to taste
6  red radishes, cut into 1/8 dice, fo; r garnish

This soup should be very velvety smooth, so be sure to strain it.
Freshly snipped chives would be just right for a garnish along with
the radishes.

1. Melt butter or butter substitute in a large, heavy pot over low
heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, about 10-12 minutes
or until wilted.

2. Add the chicken broth and peas. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a
simmer and cook, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Stir in the mint
and cool slightly.

3. Puree the soup in a blender or food processor in small batches
until completely smooth, pouring each batch through a strainer into a
bowl to remove any skins from the peas. Use the back of a wooden
spoon to mash the solids gently, extracting any excess liquid.

4. Stir in the cream and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover
and chill well in the refrigerator until serving time.

5. To serve, ladle small portions into demitasse cups. Garnish each
portion with diced radishes.

Sup Mang Tay Cua (Asparagus Crab Soup)

soups/stews, vietnamese

2 1/2 quart water
2 lb pork bones
2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon fish sauce (nuoc mam)
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1  clove garlic, chopped
2  shallots or
2  scallions, chopped white part
1/2 lb crab meat, fresh, frozen, or canned
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved in
2 tablespoon water
1  egg
1 can (15 ounces) white asparagus, undrai; ned
1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander (chinese pa; rsley)
1/4 cup chopped scallion greens

The French introduced asparagus to the Vietnamese, who promptly
incorporated this classic vegetable into their cuisine. The
Vietnamese word for asparagus is "Western bamboo," due to its
resemblance to bamboo shoots. asparagus is universally popular
throughout Vietnam, this light, tasty dish will delight your family
as well.

Bring water to a boil and put the pork bones in. Remove the scum, then
cover and continue to boil the bones for 1 hour. Remove the bones
from the stock and discard. Add the salt and the fish sauce to the
stock.

Heat the oil and add the chopped garlic and shallots; add the crab
meat and fry for 5 minutes over high heat. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon
of black pepper, stirring constantly, then add the crab meat mixture
to the soup and bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch-and-water
mixture and stir for a few minutes.

Break the egg open and drop it into the actively boiling soup while
stirring.  Cook, still stirring, for about 2 minutes, then drop in the
asparagus, along with the liquid from the can and the rest of the
black pepper.  Continue to cook until the asparagus is heated through.

Sprinkle the coriander and scallion green over the soup before
serving.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.

1  stephen ceideburg
500 gm white fleshed sweet potatoes
2 tablespoon olive oil
1  onion, finely chopped
4  tomatoes
900 ml beef stock
1/2 bunch fresh coriander leaves

If you serve this to guests it is odds on no-one will know what the
soup is based on. It is also a good bet that there will be takers for
seconds.

boil until tender. Drain well and set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan and saute 1 onion,
finely chopped, until transparent. Meanwhile pour boiling water over
4 tomatoes in a bowl, leave for 2 minutes and drain. Peel the
tomatoes (the skin will pull off easily) and chop them. Add tomatoes
to the onions and cook for about 5 minutes until soft.

Into a blender or food processor put the sweet potatoes and the tomato
mixture. Add 300 ml beef stock and puree. Return to the saucepan, add
a further 600 ml stock, adjust seasoning to taste and reheat. Finely
chop half a bunch of coriander leaves. Ladle the soup into bowls and
scatter the coriander over the top.

Sylvia's Easiest Best Crockpot Stock

crockpot, soup/stew

      ----COPYRIGHT 1995 S.STEIGER----
      ----VEGETABLES OF CHOICE----
      ----HERBS OF CHOICE----
1  turkey or chicken carcass
1  water
1  onions
2  carrots
1 teaspoon celery seed; or stalks
2  bay leaves
2 tablespoon parsley
1 tablespoon sage leaves
2 tablespoon oregano leaves
1 tablespoon rosemary leaves
2  cloves, whole
1  water

Cram as much of turkey carcass & leavings as will fit into crockpot.
(I usually only manage to get about 1/2 of a carcass in.) Use all the
leavings, including skin, even if you plan on defatting the stock. Add
remaining ingredients and cover with water to within an inch or so of
the top.  Cover crockpot and cook on low at least 2-3 DAYS (not a
tyop!). Defat, strain out solids, package in pints or quarts, and
freeze until needed.

Sylvia's comments: This recipe, that I developed, is the easiest I've
ever seen, and it produces the richest, most flavorful stock. If it's
inconvenient to let it cool and package it after 3 days, let it cook
another day or so until it is convenient.  You can't overcook it (at
least I haven't managed to), the longer it cooks the richer it gets.
I do check it every day or so to see if I need to add water, but I
rarely have to. Don't flinch at the cloves, they don't add a clove-y
flavor but they do add a nice hint of something. Since the stock is
unsalted, it is great for anyone trying to restrict sodium intake.
And it tastes so good that I try to snag turkey or chicken carcasses
whenever I can. Let others take home the meat and stuffing, I want
the carcass! <g> I also make stock from the bones of the whole KFC
Rotisserie Gold chicken we buy occasionally.

1 tablespoon salt
1 each little dumplings (recipe)
1 tablespoon lard
1 small onions
2 tablespoon flour, all-purpose
3 each garlic cloves; chopped, mashed

Put 2 quarts water in a large soup pot and in it cook bones and
vegetables with salt over low heat for 2 hours. Strain and save
liquid.
Put drained beans into the reserved liquid; add enough water to
bring the amount back to 2 quarts. Cook covered over low heat till
beans are done.
Make little dumplings and put aside.
Melt the lard in a frying pan. Wilt onion in it, then mix in the

cup cold water. Add to the almost ready bean soup and cook the soup

Tapioca Soup

soups, thai

5 cup pork stock [chicken works just fine; . s.c.]
1/2 cup minced or ground pork
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
3 tablespoon fish sauce
1/2 cup tapioca
1/2 cup cooked or canned crab meat
1  pepper
      ----GARNISH----
4  lettuce leaves, coarsely chopped
12  coriander leaves

Tapioca is a plant product made from the roots of the cassava plant-
~also called manioc.  It's a major product in Thailand and I saw
"tapioca trees" all over the place. The plant itself isn't a tree,
but they take the rootstocks and tie them into bundles which they set
upright in the fields so they don't rot during the rainy season.
Leaves sprout from the top of the bundle and the whole thing looks
like a tree.  The root has a poisonous acid in it that has to be
removed by cooking. Those little balls are actually made++like
risotto or "rice pasta". It's usually used to make sweet puddings
here, but in the Orient it's used to make thick, savory soups.  Like
this one!

Heat the stock to simmering in a large pan.  Pour 1/2 cup of the hot
stock into a bowl and stir in the pork. Return mixture to the pan.
Add the garlic and fish sauce to taste, then add the tapioca and cook
for 5 to 10 minutes. When the tapioca is clear, add the crab meat and
season to taste with pepper.  Remove from the heat. Line individual
soup bowls with the lettuce. Pour in the soup and sprinkle with
coriander leaves.

From "Discover Thai Cooking" by Chaslin, Canungmai and Tettoni, Times
Editions, Singapore.  1987.

This is a simple, excellent soup and subject to all sorts of
variations.

Tarascan Bean Soup

soups, vegetables

1/2 lb dry red kidney beans (1 1/4 cups)
2  sprigs epazote, finely chopped (opt; ional) *
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon toasted ** dry oregano
1/2 large white onion, sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 lb roma tomatoes
2  cloves roasted *** garlic
2 tablespoon pureed chipotles in adobo (see reci; pe)
2  pasilla de oaxaca chilies (or ancho; s or mulatos),
1  stemmed
1/2 cup peanut oil
3 oz monterey jack cheese cut into 4 sli; ces.

"This soup's hearty nature is appropriate, given the legendary
fierceness of the Tarascan Indians of Michoacan, with whom the dish
originated. The Tarascan civilization of the 14 th and 15th centuries
was one of the few that was never conquered by the Aztecs, and was
one of the last in Mexico to fall to the Spanish conquistadores.

* This herb might be found at Hispanic markets. ** Toast oregano by
quickly stirring it in a hot, dry skillet for about 1 minute. ***
Roast the garlic by wrapping it in foil and slowly baking it in a 300
F oven for about 25 minutes.

Place the beans in a saucepan with the epazote, salt and oregano. Add
enough water to cover the beans. Cover the pan and bring to a boil.
Reduce to a simmer, and cook for about 1 1/2 hours or until the beans
are soft, stirring occasionally.  Add more water as necessary.

Saute the onions briefly in the olive oil.  Cut the tomatoes in half
and remove the seeds.  Place the tomato halves on a baking sheet and
roast in a 350 F oven for 45 minutes (this intensifies their flavor).
Transfer the tomatoes to a blender, add the cooked beans, onions and
chipotle puree, and blend.  Add a little water if it seems too thick.
Put the pureed mixture through a medium-mesh or fine-mesh sieve or
pass it through a food mill, to remove seeds and skins.

Transfer the soup to a saucepan and heat over low heat. Meanwhile,
lightly fry the chilies in the peanut oil for a few seconds, just
until softened, and then cut into strips. Add the slices of cheese
and the chili strips to the soup and season with salt to taste. When
the cheese has melted, ladle the soup into bowls and serve.

Makes 4 servings.

To cook terrapins:  Boil a few and pick them, cutting out the gall
bladder, which is attached to the liver. Be sure not to break the
gall sac. Reserve the eggs, and put all to stew with 1/2 pint of
claret, and rather more Madeira, until done.

Force egg yolks through a sieve, then cream then with butter. Scald
cream over hot water, add seasonings, and beat in egg yolk and butter
mixture. Add terrapin and sherry, and heat thoroughly.

4  tortillas; corn (optional); cut into

2 lb stew meat, boneless (option)
2 cup chicken mixture; (optional) from chicken f

1. Cook onion, garlic, and stew meat (if using as main course), in
oil in Dutch oven until onion is tender but not brown; drain well.
Add tomatoes (with juice) to Dutch oven with remaining ingredients
except tortillas and cheese.
2. Bring to a boil; reduce heat.  Simmer uncovered 1 hour.
3. Add tortillas; continue simmering 10 minutes. Ladle into soup
bowls; sprinkle with cheese and serve with additional picante sauce.

Makes 6 to 8 servings, about 9 cups soup.

**NOTE: This is so delicious, no one will believe how easy it is to
make. My "variations" are listed as the "OR" in ingredients...found
it to taste the same.  I usually don't even mess with the tortillas
and cheese. It tastes wonderful served with "Chicken Flautas"...or
just make the chicken as indicated in the Flauta recipe (except chunk
the chicken) and just toss into this soup! I think this could also
easily be adapted to crockpot!

Note from Pace: This spicy, tortilla-topped soup owes its authentic
south-of-the-border flavor to PACE picante sauce and slow, siesta-like
simmering. Source: Pace Picante 40th Anniversary Cookbook

Thai Chicken & Coconut Milk Soup

thai

12 oz canned coconut milk
1  such as chaokoh
1/4 lb chicken breast
1  cut into small chunks
1  lime; juice and grated peel
1  4 piece of lemon grass
1  cut into very thin
1  (1/16) slices on the
1  diagonal
3 slice galanga (more if desired)
1  or substitute fresh ginger
1  hot chile peppers to taste
1  cut into thin circles
1  cilantro for garnish

* Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
(though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe
below).

Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let
stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan,
place the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or
ginger, and (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you
don't want the whole dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the
earlier you add them, the hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the
coconut milk to a simmer.

When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and
stir to distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just
below a boil and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken
pieces are finished cooking. Remove from heat and serve immediately
with fresh cilantro leaves for garnish.

Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh
grouper instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead
of the ginger, and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai
birds. We also served it over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it
southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who cares, it was wonderful.  If you
can't find grouper, it'd be good with any tender, delicate white fish
~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or maybe little chunks of
monkfish. I believe I've had this with shrimp as well.  (Grouper,
BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I recall, in
other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white, very
tender, and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian
grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd
guess that Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)

Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome
available in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can
usually find it frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't
find it at Tin Tin or the New Castro Market, you have to have friends
smuggle it in from Bangkok for you...  Other parts of the country may
vary.)

2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I
could barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and
mild. I like it in the middle.

3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I
can tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient
demand, I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just
eat around the slices of lemon grass and ginger.

Thai Chicken Coconut Soup

thai

4 can coconut milk
1  (the unsweetened kind)
3 tablespoon chopped scallions
1 teaspoon to
3 teaspoon lemon grass
1  cilantro (pref. fresh) *
1  tofu
1  cubed into smallish pieces
1  chicken
1  also cubed to bite size.
1  mushrooms
1  carrot; grated
1  juice from (8?) limes
1  i can never put in enough
      Serrano chillies ---- OR -----
1  other hot chili pepper,
1  preferably fresh,
1  but powdered will do)
1 teaspoon galanga powder

* (I sometimes leave this out.  Niels says that's
defeating the whole point, but I think it still comes
out great)

Instructions: ============= Heat the coconut milk in a
pot. Add everything else.  As the lemon grass is
inedible, put it in a tea ball and immerse the ball in
the soup so you can retrieve it later. Cook until the
chicken is done and the soup is hot (30 minutes?).
Taste to see if it needs more limes (it always does)
or more hot peppers (it's better to start mild and
build up to the desired level of spicyness).

The Best Black Bean Soup

soups, vegetables

1 lb black beans, picked over, rinsed, a; nd soaked for
10  hours or longer in water to cover b; y at
1  least 4 inches
6 cup beef broth
8 cup water
1 can tomatoes with their juice, chopped; (28 to 32
1  ounces)
2 teaspoon cumin
1  salt to taste (optional)
1  freshly ground black pepper to tast; e
1  jalapeno cream:
2/3 cup plain nonfat or low-fat yogurt
1  or 2 fresh jalapenos or pickled jal; apenos, seeded and
1  minced
3 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro (optional)
1  garnishes (optional):
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1/2  avocado, peeled, seeded, and choppe; d

SOUP:

Drain the beans and put them in a large, heavy pot. Add the broth and
water.  Bring the beans to a boil, stirring them a few times, reduce
the heat, and simmer the beans in the uncovered pot for 1 hour.

Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and the cumin, and continue
simmering the beans for 2 hours or until the beans are soft (check
after 1 and 1 1/2 hours, since the timing depends on the dryness or
age of the beans.)

Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and let the mixture cool
briefly. Rinse out the pot.  Then puree the mixture in batches in a
blender or food processor until the mixture is smooth, returning the
puree to the pot as you go.

Season the soup with the salt (if desired) and pepper, and bring the
soup to a simmer.  If the soup is too thin, simmer it in the
uncovered pot, stirring it often, until the desired consistency is
reached.

To prepare jalapeno cream, whisk together the yogurt, jalapenos,
parsley, and, if you are using it, cilantro. Serve a dollop of the
jalapeno cream atop each bowl of soup. If you wish, you may also
garnish the soup with the chopped red onion and/or chopped avocado.

PREPARATION TIPS:  You can prepare the soup up to 4 days in advance
and store it, covered, in the refrigerator. Or you can freeze it. The
jalapeno cream can be prepared 1 or 2 days ahead.

SERVING SUGGESTIONS:  In addition to the jalapeno cream, try
garnishing the soup with chopped red onion and/or chopped avocado.
With bread and salad, this soup could be the base for a light lunch.

Makes 6 to 8 main or 8 to 10 first-course servings.

The Ten Commandments Of Pickling - Martha Ste

soup/stew, info, pantry

1  no ingredients found

1. Use only the freshest ingredients, straight from the garden if
possible. Avoid produce with a waxed coating; it won't absorb brine.

2. Wash produce and cut off any bruised or discolored bits. Dirt and
spoilage that wouldn't be harmful when eaten fresh could breed
dangerous bacteria when seated in a jar.

3. Use salt without additives, such as kosher or pickling salt. Avoid
sea salt, which contains minerals, and iodized table salt.

4. Only white and cider vinegars have high enough acid levels for safe
pickling. If your pickles are too tart, don't decrease the
vinegar-add more sugar instead. Never boil the syrup beyond the time
specified; prolonged boiling breaks down acetic acid, making it too
weak to prevent bacterial growth.

5. Only jars specified for home canning are made to withstand the
stresses and high temperatures of the process. Use vintage canning
jars only if they are in perfect condition and can be used with new
two-piece screw lids for a secure fit. Use the flat lid only once.
Screw bands can be reused if they are rust-free and not bent.

6. Keep everything at its proper temperature. Pickles, jars, and lids
should be hot. Begin timing sterilizing of jars and water bath after
the water has come to a boil.

7. Leave pickles out to cool for twenty-four hours after processing.
Before storing them, check seals: The lids should be taut and sucked
slightly inward by the vacuum inside. Jars with loose seals should be
refrigerated and the pickles eaten within a week.

8. Date the pickles. "Mine could sit in the cabinet for ten years,"
says Salli LaGrone. "I wouldn't want to serve them to company."

9. Store jars in a cool, dry, dark place. Moisture affects the seal;
light can bleach pickles.

10. Inspect each jar before opening it. Press down on the lid; if it
gives or "clicks," the seal has broken and the pickles must be
discard- ed. When you open the jar, check for mold, leakage around
the rim, gas or bubbling inside, funny smells, and slimy pickles. If
any of these are the case, throw away the entire jar where children
and pets will not find it.

Three Meat Stew With Vegetables (Pichelsteine

german, soup/stew

1 tablespoon lard
1 1/4 lb pork and beef as well as lamb or mu; tton (mutton gives
1  an excellent flavor), cut into 3/4; inch cubes
2 medium to 3 md onions, diced
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
1  crushed marjoram
3 medium potatoes, peeled and finely diced
1 small celery root, peeled and diced, or 4; celery
1  stalks, diagonally sliced
1/2 lb carrots, peeled and diagonally slic; ed
1 large leek (white part only), washed and; sliced
2 cup beef stock
1  chopped fresh parsley

Heat the lard in a heavy bottomed pot (or ovenproof Pyrex casserole
or the like).  Lightly sear and mix together the meat cubes and the
onions; season with salt, an ample amount of pepper, and a very
little bit of crushed marjoram.  Remove two thirds of the meat and
onions from the pot and set aside.

Mix the potatoes and vegetables together; spread a third of these
over the bottom layer of meat cubes in the pot or casserole. Sprinkle
with salt and a little pepper. Alternate 2 more layers of meat with 2
more layers of vegetables.  Each layer should be separately seasoned
with salt and pepper; the top layer MUST consist of vegetables and
potatoes. Pour in the beef stock. Cover tightly and cook over
medium-low heat for just about 2 hours. Cooking in a 350 degrees F
oven is also possible. You should not stir the stew, but you can tilt
the pot back and forth to circulate the liquid and prevent the bottom
layer from burning. Serve sprinkled with chopped parsley.

Variations:

Savoy cabbage is frequently added to the roster of vegetables, and it
tastes delicious.  Sliced kohlrabi would be fine as well.

For a truly gourmet 'Pichelsteiner', 6 to 8 slices of bone marrow
should be briefly sauteed with the onions at the beginning, then
added to one of the in-between layers of meat. Doubling of
ingredients is advisable. Pichelsteiner tastes excellent reheated.

Makes 4 servings.

Tinned Toheroa Soup (Nz)

soups, new zealand

1  tin toheroas
1 pint milk
1 pint cream

Toheroas are considered New Zealand's greatest delicacy. Their flavor
is quite unique. This shellfish is like a very large cockle. It
burrows into the sand and is only to be found on certain beaches and
the season in which it can be gathered is strictly limited as is the
catch which can be taken on any one day. When the toheroa gathering
season is on, New Zealanders in their thousands flock to these
beaches to dig by hand or wooden implement (metal ones are not
permitted) for these succulent molluscs. Since a visit to New Zealand
is necessary adjunct to getting fresh toheroas here is a recipe which
uses the tinned variety for those who cannot visit "the land of the
long white cloud".

Some fish heads

1. Boil the fish heads in water for 15-20 minutes with salt and pepper
added to taste.

2. Strain and add minced toheroas from can to the stock and a little
grated onion.

3. Simmer gently for 15 minutes and add milk.

4. Thicken with a little flour and water paste.

5. Whip the cream and add just before serving. Serves 4

Toam Yum Gai (Thai Soup)

thai, soup/stew

      ----GENERIC CHICKEN BROTH----
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil
3  whole cloves
2  bay leaves
1  sprig of fresh thyme *
1 medium onion; cut into pieces
2 large carrots; cut into pieces
1  chicken, cut into pieces **
6 cup water
      ----EVERYTHING ELSE----
1  mushrooms ***
1  shrimp if you want ***
1  stalk lemongrass - cut into 2 inch; pieces
2 slice galanga root - (more if you like -; chewing on them.)
4  kaffir lime leaves
1  cilantro leaves as desired
1 teaspoon chili sauce
2 tablespoon fish sauce
1 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
      ----OPTIONAL----
1  sliced hot peppers (2 or 3 slices p; er serving)

* (ad libbed with about 1 tsp or 1 tblsp of powdered thyme)

** (Some boneless skinless chicken pieces, plus some thighs with the
bones bashed once with the back of a knife would be ok too -- the
point being to get the flavor from the marrow out.)

*** as many as you want, cut any way you want, of any kind you want

Instructions: ============= Use a large covered stockpot. Heat olive
and sesame oil on high heat. Add cloves, bay leaves, thyme, (these
should be pounded a bit first to crack the fibers and release more
flavor) and onion, carrots.  Cover 2 minutes, stir if you want.

Add chicken on top, and pour ONE cup of water over the tops of the
chicken. Cover.  Cook 5 minutes on high.

Add remainder of water, cover, continue heating till it starts to
boil, then turn heat down and simmer covered 30 minutes. Skim off foam
occasionally. Remove chicken, debone, and cut into bite sized pieces.
Strain soup, avoid getting the sediment at the bottom. (What you do
with the leftover veggies after making a stock is up to you. I think
they end up in Minnesotan hot dishes....)

Take 4 cups of the stock, heat until it begins to boil, turn down the
heat till it is just simmering. Add galanga, lemongrass, Kaffir lime
leaves (bash them a bit to break the fibers--it allows them to
release more flavor).  Add mushrooms, chicken, (shrimp if you must).
Stir in the fish sauce, chili paste.  Cover, cook for another 5
minutes. Serve.

Add lemon juice (just have slices of lemon or lime that you can
squeeze) cilantro, and thinly sliced jalepenos or other hot peppers
at the table. Fresh liquorice basil also adds a nice touch.

Comments/Modifications: ======================= We cheated and used
Swansons reduced salt chicken stock for the water in the beginning
because we used boneless skinless chicken. Can't tell if it hurt or
helped.

Also had 4 shiitake mushrooms which had been soaking for several
days, so they were cut up, and the soaking juice was added along with
the chicken and mushrooms. About one cup of this. Big win. Yum.

Toasted Almond Soup The Inn At Long Last

appetizers, soups, fruits/nuts

2 quart chicken or vegetable stock
1/3 cup long-grain rice
1/2 cup blanched almonds
1 tablespoon butter
1  large onion, chopped
1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
1/4 cup dry sherry
2 tablespoon almond paste
1  grated zest of 1 orange
1 cup evaporated skim milk
1  salt and white pepper
1 1/4 cup slivered toasted almonds
1  grated orange zest

1.  Spray a large soup pot with Pam.  Add the stock and bring to a
boil. Turn down the heat to medium-low, and add the rice and blanced
almonds. Cover and let cook slowly for 30 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, spray a 10-inch skillet with Pam, and in it melt the
butter over medium heat.  Add the onion, and saute until it starts to
soften, about 3 1/2 minutes. Lower the heat slightly, and add the
garlic. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, to soften the garlic
for about 20 seconds. Stir in the sherry, then crumble in the almond
paste a bit at a time. Remove the skillet from the heat, and whisk
well to smooth it out.
3.  Lower the heat under the stock to the barest possible simmer. Add
the onion mixture, the orange zest, and evaporated skim milk. Let
cook to blend flavors, 10 minutes more.
4.  Puree the soup, in batches, in a food processor, then put through
a food-mill or power strainer. Season to taste with salt and white
pepper.
5.  Reheat just before serving, and serve, very hot, in small cups.
Garnish soup with toasted almonds and the merest bit of orange zest.

Tom Moore's Irish Stew Casserole

casseroles, irish, lamb, stews

1 lb lean lamb, the shoulder or leg, cut; into 1 dice
2  potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
1  onion, thinly sliced
1 pinch [generous] rosemary
1  chicken or lamb stock
1  salt, pepper to taste

Layer one third of the potatoes in a small casserole. Top with half
the lamb and half the onion.  Sprinkle lightly with rosemary, salt
and pepper. Repeat layers, ending with a final layer of potato. Add
enough chicken stock to almost cover the stew.

Cover the casserole and bake in a 325 oven until the lamb is quite
tender and the potatoes begin to almost dissolve and thicken the
mixture. (1- 1 1/2 hours)

I've made this in larger quantities in a crock pot. In this case, the
cooking time will be about 8-10 hours.

I got these directions for making Irish Stew (no real recipe) from the
owner of Tom Moore's Tavern in Bermuda (don't know how authentic it
is, as the gentleman was German, but it IS good) .

1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
3  garlic cloves; chopped fine
2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice roasted
2 teaspoon salt
2 cup coriander; coarsly chopped
      ----SOUP----
6  chicken drumsticks; skinned
1 teaspoon chopped garlic and sliced
6 cup good chicken stock kaffir lime leav; es -
3/4 cup chopped onions or shallots -
3  slices fresh or frozen

2 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon lime juice
3  red chillies; seeded
1 tablespoon pepper and coriander paste
2  fresh, frozen, or dried
1  galangal, sliced
2 tablespoon fish sauce (nam pla)
1  chopped fresh coriander

(Thai Chicken in Lemon Grass Soup) This is from Charmaine Solomon's
newest publication: THAI COOKBOOK.

TO MAKE PEPPER AND CORIANDER PASTE: This is a basic Thai flavoring
and will make about one cup which you can store in your fridge. You
will use about one teaspoon of it in the Tom Yum Gai. In a dry
skillet, dry roast about one Tbs whole black peppercorns for a minute
or two.

In your blender whizz up the peppercorns together with 2 or 3 garlic
cloves, 2 tsp salt, 2 Tbs lemon juice, and a big bunch of fresh
coriander (cilantro) which you have coarsely chopped, stems and roots
included (about 2 cups).

TO MAKE THE SOUP: Whack each drumstick in two. Whizz up the garlic,
chillies, and Pepper and Coriander Paste together in your blender,
and mix with the chicken. Allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Place the
stock, lime leaves (or zest), onions, galangal, lemon grass, and
sugar in a large saucepan together with the chicken and simmer about
30 minutes or until chicken is tender. Add fish sauce and lime juice.
Adjust flavorings for spicy and sour to your taste. Serve garnished
with coriander and sliced chillies.

NOTES: Be aware that the fresh chillies used for this recipe are very
acidic. Thorougly wash your hands after handling. DO NOT rub your eyes
until you have washed your hands. Submitted By CHIAPET1@IX.NETCOM.COM

Tom Yum Goong (Hot & Sour Shrimp Soup) #1

thai, soup/stew

3/4 lb shelled shrimp (reserve shells)
3 tablespoon peanut or other vegetable oil
1 cup chicken stock
5 cup water
8  khaffir lime leaves (substitute zes; t of lime)
3  stalks lemon grass, each cut into 3; sections and crushed
1 tablespoon fish sauce
6  ozs fresh mushrooms, quartered (or; 1 can straw mushrooms)
3 tablespoon fish sauce
3 tablespoon fresh lime juice
3  fresh red chillies, sliced (use tha; i birdseye chilies if you
1  coriander leaves
1  chopped scallions
1 can find them)

In 4-quart pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil.  Add shrimp and stir-fry
briefly until pink but not done.  Remove shrimp and reserve. Add
tablespoon oil and stir-fry shells until pink. Add stock and water,
lime leaves, lemon grass, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce. Bring to boil.
Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes, covered. Strain broth and set
aside until ready to serve. Discard shrimp shells but save lemon
grass and lime leaves to serve in soup. TO ASSEMBLE SOUP:  Add
mushrooms to broth (if using straw nushrooms drain them first) and
simmer until done,about 5 minutes. Add shrimp and simmer briefly
until done (DO NOT OVERCOOK). Just before serving, add fish sauce,
lime juice, and chillies, garnish with coriander leaves and
scallions. Notes: Khaffir lime leaves, lemon grass, fish sauce, fresh
coriander, and Thai birdseye chillies are available in Asian grocery
stores. Use any fresh hot chili if unable to find the Thai ones.
Although the lime leaves and lemon grass are returned to the soup for
serving, they are flavorings only and are not eaten.  Use zest of
about 1/2 lemon if unable to find lemon grass. If you can find shrimp
with the heads on, fry the heads as well as the tail shells for a
richer broth. Discard with shells. From The Cookie Lady's Files

1  sprig basil leaves or 1 tsp dry

SOURCE: National Gardening, June '90.

This easy-to-make soup gives a whole new, flavorful meaning to the
term 'broth'.  It can be served hot or cold.

Peel tomatoes by dropping them into boiling water for 1 minute. Under
cool water, slip off peels.  Coarsely chop and place in a 4 quart
saucepan with remaining ingredients except the chicken broth. Simmer
uncovered, over medium heat for 25 minutes.

Remove bay leaf and transfer soup to a blender or food processor.
Puree for 30 seconds.  Set up a food mill or colander over the
original saucepan, and press the pureed soup through the mill into
the pan. Add the broth; simmer until ready to serve.  Garnish with
snow peas.

Tomato Egg Drop Soup

chinese

1 quart chicken stock
2 medium fresh tomatoes, or: drained
1 cup canned tomatoes
2 small eggs
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
2 teaspoon light soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon finely chopped scallions
1  white part only
1  (reserve tops for garnish)

Egg Drop Soup is traditionally Chinese. Tomatoes are not. They were
introduced less than 100 years ago, but nevertheless, they work
wonderfully in this soup.

PUT THE CHICKEN STOCK into a pot and bring to a simmer. If using fresh
tomatoes, peel, seed and cut into 1-inch cubes. If using canned
tomatoes, chop them into small chunks. Lightly beat the eggs, then
combine them with sesame oil in a small bowl. Add the light soy sauce
and salt to the simmering stock, and stir to mix them in well. Add
the tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes. Next, stir in the scallions,
and then add the egg mixture in a very slow, thin stream. Using a
chopstick or fork, pull the egg slowly into strands. (Stirring the
egg in a "figure 8" works well.) Garnish with the finely chopped
scallion tops.

Tomato Fennel & Potato Stew

soups, vegetarian

1 1/2 lb potatoes  red or yellow-fleshed
2  fennel bulbs
1 lb ripe tomatoes; peeled and seeded, juice
1  salt
4 tablespoon virgin olive oil
1 large leek; white part only,  finely
1 large yellow onion  cut into wedges 1/2 t; hick
2  garlic cloves; minced
1 teaspoon herbes de provence
3 pinch saffron threads
1 large strip orange zest (2 long)
2  bay leaves
1 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoon chopped parsley
12  nicoise olives, pitted; -or-  gaeta or oil-cured

PEEL THE POTATOES AND SLICE them lengthwise into quarters or, if
large, into 6ths. Trim the fennel, remove the outer leaves if they're
scarred, and cut into wedges 1/2-inch thick or a little wider. Leave
some of the core so that the pieces stay intact. Cut the tomatoes
into large, neat pieces. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt to
taste and the potatoes, and boil for 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes,
but save the water. While the potatoes are cooking, warm the olive
oil in a wide pan. When hot, add the leek, onion, garlic, herbs, a
little salt, saffron, orange zest and bay leaves. Cook slowly over
medium heat until the onions have begun to soften, after 6 or 7
minutes, then add the wine. Let it reduce by approximately half, then
add the tomatoes and their juice, the potatoes, fennel, half the
parsley and the olives. Pour in enough of the reserved potato water
to cover, bring to a boil and lower the heat. At this point, you can
set the stew aside and finish it later, either in the oven or on top
of the stove. If cooking on top of the stove, cover the pan and cook
slowly until the vegetables are tender, about 35 minutes. If cooking
in the oven, preheat it to 375F, cover loosely and bake for about 1
hour, or until done. Remove bay leaves. Garnish with the remaining
parsley and serve with a bowl of garlic mayonnaise.

Tomato Lentil Soup

soups

15 oz tomato sauce
11 oz tomato paste
4 cup chicken stock
1 cup cooked lentils or split peas
1/2 cup onions, finely chopped
6 slice bacon; finely chopped
1/4 cup celery; chopped
1/2 teaspoon pepper, fresh ground
1  salt to taste
1 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon sage
1 cup whipping cream
1/3 cup cheddar cheese; grated
3 tablespoon butter

Melt butter in a large saucepan or small stock pot. Saute chopped
onions, bacon and celery with pepper, basil, thyme, oregano, nutmeg
and sage. When vegetables are softened and bacon cooked add tomato
sauce, tomato paste and chicken stock, stir well to blend. Add
lentils or split yellow peas. Lower heat and simmer for 30 to 45
minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking. Just before serving
adjust spices and add salt to taste. Gently fold in whipping cream
and cheddar cheese.

Tom Bullick said, "Serves six to eight.  As the end of the season
approached and food supplies tightened at the lodge, I modified a
tomato-cheese recipe in the Harrowsmith Cookbook (vol. I), to provide
a real rib-sticking soup. Served with basic bread, it's perfect after
a long, cold, wet day."

Sylvia's comments: believe it or not, this didn't have enough flavor
to suit me!  I added a few dashes of Worcestershire, which helped,
but not enough.  I also added a couple cups of cooked rice, and wish
I'd left out the potatoes; they just didn't meld with the tomato-ey
flavor.  This was a good idea but unsatisfactory execution.

Tomato Soup A La Tony Hammerquist (From Bob Strom!)

Text only:

"This is an interesting mix that may prove valuable in the event that
you or a loved one comes across a black creature with a white stripe
up it's back!

In a LARGE pot, fill three quarters full with tomato juice.

Insert 1 dog, being certain that the pot is big enough... but not TOO
big!

Add one quarter of lemon juice, six ounces of Tabasco sauce, four
tablespoons of Worchestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste.

Simmer on no heat until the smell is gone. HINT: It's done when the
dog's tongue turns SMOKEY!

Flush the juice down the drain, because the City Sewage Treatment
plant needs the nutrients to work properly. Wash off the dog with a
mixture of soap, warm water and Pinesol, and you're done! All that is
left is to clean up the dishes.. the real fun part!"

1 tablespoon grated horseradish or 2 tbsp horser; adish sauce

Cook the chopped onion and pepper in the butter for 5 minutes. Add the
flour and blend.  Add the stock and tomatoes and simmer for 15
minutes. Pass through a sieve. Season highly with salt, pepper and
cayenne pepper. Cook the macroni seperately.  Just before serving add
the horseradish, vinegar and cooked macroni. If horseradish sauce is
used instead of fresh horseradish, less vinegar will be necessary.

Tomato, Fennel And Potato Stew

stews, vegetarian

1 1/2 lb potatoes  red or yellow-fleshed
2  fennel bulbs
1 lb ripe tomatoes; peeled and seeded, juice
1  salt
4 tablespoon virgin olive oil
1 large leek; white part only,  finely
1 large yellow onion  cut into wedges 1/2 t; hick
2  garlic cloves; minced
1 teaspoon herbes de provence
3 pinch saffron threads
1 large strip orange zest (2 long)
2  bay leaves
1 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoon chopped parsley
12  nicoise olives, pitted; -or-  gaeta or oil-cured

PEEL THE POTATOES AND SLICE them lengthwise into quarters or, if
large, into 6ths. Trim the fennel, remove the outer leaves if they're
scarred, and cut into wedges 1/2-inch thick or a little wider. Leave
some of the core so that the pieces stay intact. Cut the tomatoes
into large, neat pieces. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt to
taste and the potatoes, and boil for 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes,
but save the water. While the potatoes are cooking, warm the olive
oil in a wide pan. When hot, add the leek, onion, garlic, herbs, a
little salt, saffron, orange zest and bay leaves. Cook slowly over
medium heat until the onions have begun to soften, after 6 or 7
minutes, then add the wine. Let it reduce by approximately half, then
add the tomatoes and their juice, the potatoes, fennel, half the
parsley and the olives. Pour in enough of the reserved potato water
to cover, bring to a boil and lower the heat. At this point, you can
set the stew aside and finish it later, either in the oven or on top
of the stove. If cooking on top of the stove, cover the pan and cook
slowly until the vegetables are tender, about 35 minutes. If cooking
in the oven, preheat it to 375F, cover loosely and bake for about 1
hour, or until done. Remove bay leaves. Garnish with the remaining
parsley and serve with a bowl of garlic mayonnaise.

Tomato-Basil Soup

appetizers, vegetables

2 lb tomatoes; diced
2  cloves garlic; coarsely chopped
2 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup dry red wine
5 cup vegetable stock
1 can tomato paste
2 bunch basil; coarsely chopped
1  salt
1  ground black pepper

Dice the tomatoes into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.

Heat olive oil until it is warmed.  Add the garlic & saute it very
gently only until it becomes fragrant.  Add the tomatoes, stir once &
add the remaining ingredients except the basil & salt & pepper. Raise
the heat a little, cover & let the soup cook gently without ever
letting it quite come to the boil.  Let it cook like this for 45
minutes. You want the tomatoes to be softened.  Add the seasonings &
the basil. Cook long enough to warm the basil through.  Serve with
freshly baked, crusty, Italian bread.

MARK'S NOTE: If you want a thin soup, omit the tomato paste.  If you
want it to be thicker, add the paste, but it will make quite a
difference to the texture of the soup.  If serving as a lunch, or
with only a light main course, then the paste makes this a rich &
satisfying soup: if serving purely as an appetizer, then omit the
tomato paste.

Also, do not let the soup come to a full rolling boil.  It is best
served warmed.  Once you add the basil, you may want to switch the
heat off & let the soup sit for a while, reheating just before
serving.

Tortilla Soup-Texas Home Cooking

soups, stews

8 cup unsalted chicken stock
6  roasted garlic cloves* mince
1/2 cup red-ripe tomatoes, chopped,
1  seeded or canned crushed
1  tomatoes
1 medium onion, 1/2 chopped and
1  1/2 sliced into thin rings
1  fresh jalapeno, sliced into
1  thin rings
1  chipotle chile (whole if
1  dried, or minced if canned
1 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably
1  mexican
2 cup shredded cooked chicken or
1  turkey
1  juice of 1 lime
1  salt to taste
4  corn totillas, sliced, into
1  thin strips, toasted or
1  broiled until crisp.
1  chopped cilantro,
1  cubed avacado,
1  mexican asadero cheese
1  crumbled or
1  monterey jack cheese grated
1  for garnish

In a large, heavy saucepan, bring the stock to a boil. Reduce the
heat, and simmer uncovered until the stock is reduced to
approximately 6 cups.

Add the garlic, the tomatoes, the chopped half of the onion, the
jalapeno, the chipotle, and the oregano to the stock. Continue to
simmer, uncovered over medium-low heat another 30 minutes. While the
soup cooks, place the remaining onions (sliced) on a greased baking
sheet, and broil them until they are softened and a little brown
around the edges. Add the broiled onions, the chicken, and the lime
juice to the soup, and continue simmering until the chicken is just
heated through. If you have used a dried chipotle, remove the chile,
and either mince it and return it to the pan or discard it, depending
on how spicy you want the meal.

To serve, place a small handful of totilla strips in each bowl, and
pour the soup over. Pass the garnishes separately.

*Roasted garlic: Place individual cloves with skins on, in a heavy
skillet over low heat, and turn them until the skins darken on all
sides and the cloves soften.

NOTES: Tortilla soup originated in Mexico as a way to use old
tortillas and leftover poultry, but it developed into one of the
classics of the national cuisine. If you want the full flavor of the
dish, don't skip the steps of roasting the garlic and broiling the
onions. These actions add a smoky mellowness to the soup which you
can enhance even more by using smoked poultry.

1  chopped
1  clove pressed garlic
1  stalk celery -- peeled and
1  sliced
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
28 oz plum tomatoes -- canned
1  chopped
4 cup chicken stock -- or
1  vegetable
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon brown sugar
5  sun-dried tomatoes
10  cherry tomatoes

1. Melt butter over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed saucepan or
stockpot. Add onion, garlic, celery, and curry powder and cook,
covered, until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.

sun-dried tomatoes. Process until completely smooth, gradually adding
remaining broth.

a lower calorie and fat version use l/2 cup buttermilk or nonfat
yogurt. Omit basil and curry and replace with l/4 cup chopped dill.

1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup hot milk, or more as needed
1  freshly ground pepper
1 teaspoon white-truffle oil

Turkey Revenge Soup

soups

1  turkey carcass, wings & all
1  the scraps left after
1  carving*
1  any left over gravy
1  any left over vegetables
2 large carrots, sliced
2  stalks celery (& tops),
1  chopped
1 can (12 oz) no salt green
1  beans, drained
2 quart boiling water
1  any peels, root ends and
1  leafy tops left over from -
1  onions, celery, potatoes,
1  carrots
1  several bruised garlic
1  cloves
12 oz wide egg noodles
1 can (12 oz) no salt corn,
1  drained
1 large white onion, chopped
1  salt & pepper to taste

Cut wings off carcass and cut up the remaining bird as you would a
chicken for frying.  Place the carcass pieces and any left over
peelings & parings into a stock pot and fill with water.  Add garlic
cloves. Fill the stock pot with water and bring to a boil.  Reduce
heat to a simmer and let it cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.
Remove from heat to cool cover and refrigerate overnight.  The next
day remove the congealed fat from the top of the broth.  Drain the
contents through a collander into another large pot.  Return the
broth to the stock pot. Go through the collander and remove vegetable
& garlic pieces and discard. Next, go through the turkey remnants and
pull out all the meat and add to the stock pot. Add any left over
vegetables, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and the onion to the
pot.  There should be *just* enough liquid to cover the contents.
Place over heat and bring to a boil.  While you're waiting, cook the
egg noodles per package directions and drain.  Simmer the soup just
long enough to cook the carrots.  Add 2 quarts of water, egg noodles
and left over gravy. Adjust seasonings (salt & pepper). Stir well,
let simmer long enough to heat noodles and serve.

Turtle Soup From Beans (No Turtle Meat!) - Oz

soups

375 gm black bean packet
2 liter water
1 large pinch parsley
1 large pinch thyme
1 large pinch summer savory
1 teaspoon butter,cold
1  salt & pepper to taste
4 each hard boiled egg yolks,choppe
1 each lemon,sliced
1/2 each glass of wine*
1  few meatballs of forcemeat*

Soak the black beans in water overnight. Boil them in 2 liters of
water until they are soft. Puree the beans in a blender or push
through a sieve, reserving liquid. Return the puree to the soup pot
along with the liquid. Put the parsley,thyme,and summur savory into a
small piece of muslin,tie and put into the pot. Add butter and season
with salt and pepper. Simmer for at least 30 minutes. Just before
serving,add the egg yolks,lemon slices,wine, and meatballs.

Original authors note: "This soup is so near the flavor of real
turtle soup that few people are able to tell the difference!"

* Wine not specified. My guess is a dry white unless you like sweet
turtles. * Forcemeat is sausage meat, ground, not overly spicey. I
also presume that the meatballs are cooked somewhere along the way
but it doesn't mention it in the recipe.

U Ponnya's Nwa Mee Hinga (Oxtail & Watercress)

soup/stew, burmese

1 lb oxtail, divided into sections
2  cloves garlic, chopped fine
1 tablespoon fish sauce (nam pya ye)
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cup water
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/2 bunch watercress, divided into stems

The combination of oxtail and watercress gives the soup a rather
unconventional flavor and makes it a fine luncheon dish. It is
reputed to be nourishing for nursing mothers. Watercress is
specified, as substitute for the traditional green known as 'chaste
leaf' or 'Indian wild pepper' (Vitex trifolia), kyaung- ban in
Burmese.

1.  Broil the oxtail in a gas or electric broiler until well roasted
and slightly charred, about 15 minutes. Better still, barbecue over
charcoal to impart a slightly smoked flavor.

2.  Put everything except the watercress into a pan, and bring to a
boil. Cover the pan and cook over moderately low heat for 1 hour or
more to tenderize the meat until it comes away from the bone.

3.  Add the watercress, cover the pan, and cook for 3 minutes more.

Serve hot.

Ukha (Clear Salmon Soup)

fish, soups, russian

6 cup ; water
1 1/2 lb smelts, whole; cleaned well
1  onion, med
1  carrot, large; peeled/quarte
1  leek (white only)
1  celery stalk; with leaves
1  parsnip; peeled
1  bouquet garni
1  salt; to taste
1  pepper, white; to taste
1 lb salmon trimmings
3/4 cup wine, white, dry
3  potato, new
2  carrot, thin; peeled
1  egg white
1  eggshell; crushed
1 lb salmon fillet, skinned
5 tablespoon scallion; chopped
1  lemon slices, thin

Approx. Cook Time: 2:00 In a
large stock pot, place the water, smelts, onion, quartered carrot,
leek, celery, parsnip, bouquet garni, and salt and pepper, and bring
to a boil over high heat, periodically skimming off the foam as it
rises to the top. Cover the pot, reduce the heat, and simmer for 35
minutes. Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a clean pot,
pressing the solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much
liquid as possible. Discard the solids. Return the stock to the heat
and add the salmon trimmings, wine, potatoes, and thin carrots. Bring
to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the
vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Strain the stock into a
clean pot, discarding all the solids except the potatoes and all the
carrots. Rinse the potatoes and carrots being careful not to mash
them, and set aside. Return the stock to low heat and simmer for
several minutes. Add the egg white and shell and increase the heat to
medium high. Bring to a boil, beating constantly, with a wire whisk.
When the stock boils, the egg white will start rising to the surface.
At this point, turn off the heat and let stand for five minutes. Line
a colander with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth and strain the
stock into a clean pot. Add the fish fillets to the stock and poach
over medium low heat until cooked through; five minutes. Taste and
adjust the seasonings. Halve the reserved potatoes and cut into
wedges.  Cut the carrots into fine dice. Divide the fish fillets
among six soup bowls. Add a few potato wedges and diced carrots to
each bowl.  Ladle the stock into the bowls, sprinkle with scallions,
and garnish with lemon slices.

Unadulterated Black Bean Soup

soups

1 lb dried black beans
2  ham hocks
1 medium red onion
1 medium yellow onion
8 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon dry sherry or madiera (opt)
1  sour cream
1  chives

This recipe is from Katherine Hall PAge's "The Body in the Cast" (St
Martin's Press, 1993, $19.95). It's from heroine Faith Fairchild's
cookbook, called "Have Faith in Your Kitchen." Faith notes that the
soup tastes better if made a day ahead.

Pick over beans, cover with cold water and bring to boil for 2
minutes. Remove from heat and let stand at least 1 hour. (Or soak
beans overnight, changing water several times.)

Drain beans and place in a large pot. Rinse the ham hocks. Peel and
quarter the onions. Bury hocks and onions in the beans. Add 7-8 cups
water and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer 1 1/2 to 2
hours. Be sure the beans are soft.

Remove the hocks or bone and strip any meat from them. Add the meat
to the soup and puree in batches in a blender. (Note: A food
processor sometimes leaks with this much liquid.) Put the pureed soup
in a clean pot; warm, adding the seasonings and wine, if using. Serve
with a dollop of sour cream and finely minced chives.

Varenyky (Filled Dumplings)

ethnic, holiday, soups, russian, breads

5 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
1 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup water as needed

* Do not use Condensed milk in this recipe

Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl, forming a well in the
middle. Add the butter and milk and mix lightly until the flour is
absorbed. (Add a little warm water as needed.) Knead until the dough
sticks together, cover and allow to rest for a few minutes, then
knead until smooth. Cover and set aside. Place the dough in a lightly
oiled bowl, turn, and cover for about 1/2 . Place 1/4 of the dough on
a floured work surface, re-covering the rest of the dough.  Roll into
a circle, starting at the center and rolling outwards to maintain an
even thickness, turn over and from the center, roll the dough out to
about 1/8-inch thickness. Run a hand under the bottom to loosen it.
With a 3" biscuit cutter or a glass, cut into rounds. When done
cutting, place 1 T of the filling on one side of each, flipping the
other half over the top and sealing with your fingers or a fork. Be
sure to seal these well. Place each of the dumplings on a floured
cooky sheet, keeping the dumplings covered with a towel. Repeat with
the remaining dough, saving the scraps until last. Use as little
flour as possible in this process or the scraps will be come tough
and heavy. Gently drop 12 to 15 varenyky into 3 quarts of boiling
water, in a large Dutch oven. Do not overcrowd. Stir and cook for
about 3 - 4 minutes. Drain in a collander and place on a lightly
oiled cookies sheet, shaking to coat with a thin film to prevent
sticking. Do not pile the dumplings on top of each other. If the
varenyky are to be frozen, remove with a slotted spoon when they
float to the top. DO NOT overcook. To freeze. Place in the freezer on
an oiled cookie sheet when they are at room temp.. When they are
frozen hard, store in tightly sealed plastic bags. Varenyky may be
poached, pan-fried or steamed, served as an accompaniment with meats,
or served with sour cream, chopped sauteed onions, plain yogurt,
bacon or sausages.

Varenyky (Filled Dumplings) (Russian)

ethnic, soups, breads

5 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
1 cup evaporated milk; not condensed milk
1/2 cup ; water, as needed

Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl, forming a well in the
middle. Add the butter and milk and mix lightly until the flour is
absorbed. (Add a little warm water as needed.) Knead until the dough
sticks together, cover and allow to rest for a few minutes, then
knead until smooth. Cover and set aside.  (This dough should be
somewhat soft, since more flour will be added as the dough is rolled
out.) Or, in a processor, combine the flour, salt, and butter,
stirring a few times, then with the machine running, add liquids
until a ball forms. Allow to rest for a few minutes and then process
until smooth. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn, and
cover for about 30 minutes. (It may be wrapped in plastic and
refrigerated for a day or so, brought to room temperature and then
rolled out.) Place a fourth of the dough on a floured work surface,
re-covering the rest of the dough.  Roll into a circle, starting at
the center and rolling outwards to maintain an even thickness, turn
over and again from the center, roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch
thickness. Run a hand under the bottom to loosen it.  With a 3-inch
biscuit cutter or wine glass, cut into rounds. When done cutting,
place 1 tb of the filling on one side of each, flipping the other
half over the top and sealing with your fingers or a fork. Make sure
each is sealed or the filling will come out when cooked. Place each
of the dumplings on a floured cookie sheet, keeping the dumplings
covered with a towel.  Repeat with the remaining dough, saving the
scraps until last. Use as little flour as possible in this process or
the scraps will be come tough and heavy.  Gently drop 12 to 15
varenyky into 3 quarts of boiling water, in a large wide pot or Dutch
oven. Do NOT overcrowd. Stir and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain
in a collander and place on a lightly oiled cookies sheet, shaking to
coat with a thin film to prevent sticking. Do NOT pile the dumplings
on top of each other as this distorts their shape. If the varenyky
are to be frozen, remove with a slotted spoon when they float to the
top. DO NOT overcook. To freeze. place in the freezer on an oiled
cookie sheet when tepid (lukewarm). When they are rigid, store in
tightly sealed plastic bags. TO SERVE: Varenyky may be poached,
pan-fried or steamed, served as an accompaniment or meats or served
with sour cream, chopped sauteed onions or fried bacon with a little
bacon fat.

Veau Dans Le Chaudron (Veal Pot Roast) (Canad

meats, soups

3 tablespoon bacon fat or salad oil
2  garlic cloves, cut in half
1  veal - 1/2 leg or: 3 or 4 lb rolled; shoulder of veal
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon thyme or:
1/2 teaspoon savory
1  bay leaf
6 medium potatoes (6-8)
6 medium onions (6-8)

Melt or heat bacon fat or oil in cast iron saucepan. Stuff the 2
cloves of garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place
the meat in the hot fat and brown well on all sides. Don't rush this
as the color and flavor of the finished gravy will depend on how well
the meat has been browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay leaf.
Place the potatoes and onions, whole around the meat. Don't add any
liquid. Cover tightly and cook over medium heat till meat is tender,
about 2 hours. The potatoes and onions will not break as there is no
liquid added. The veal will make its own gravy. When cooked, remove
the meat from the pan to a heated platter. Place the pan over high
heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the vegetables. When they
are well coated with gravy, boil another minutes or so till the gravy
has a nice consistency. This is a complete meal.

Vegetable Bean Soup

soups

1 cup kidney beans; dried
2  garlic cloves; pressed
1  onion; chopped
2  potato; cut in chunks
1  carrot; sliced 1/2 thick
2  zucchini; sliced 1 thick
1/4 lb green beans
2  leek
1/4 lb cabbage
1  (savoy is best)
1/3 cup brown rice, long-grain; * se
3  tomato; cut in wedges
1/4 cup parsley sprigs; chopped
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1/4 teaspoon marjoram
1 teaspoon basil
1 teaspoon oregano

Recipe by: McDougall Place beans in pot with 2 quarts of water. Bring
to boil, remove from heat and let rest 1 hour. Then add chopped
onion, garlic, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.

Chop potatoes in large chunks; do not peel. Slice carrots 1/2 inch and
zucchini 1 inch thick, scrub them, do not peel. Slice leeks and cut
beans into 1 inch pieces. Add to soup pot along with seasonings.
Simmer for 1 hour longer.

Thinly slice cabbage and add to soup along with rice or spaghetti.
Simmer another 20 minutes. Add more water if too thick. Add tomato
wedges for the last 10 minutes, just before serving.

HELPFUL HINTS: Kidney beans make a good rich broth, but any kind of
bean also may be used. Soup freezes well, so make a large batch when
you have time and freeze half for use on a budy day. Try using some
chopped spinach, instead of the cabbage. By changing the vegetables
and beans used, the soup can be different each time you make it. It
is a meal in itself. From the collection of Sue Smith, S.Smith34,

Vegetable Soup

italian, soups, vegetables

8 cup chicken broth (see recipe)
1/3 cup olive oil
1/4 cup chopped parsley
4 each garlic cloves
1/4 lb pancetta or unsmoked bacon
3 cup shredded cabbage
1 each medium onion, finely chopped
2 each carrots, finely chopped
1 each celery stalk, finely chopped
1 each potato, peeled, chopped
2 each zucchini, finely chopped
1 each large tomato, chopped
1/4 lb mushrooms, finely chopped
1/4 lb string beans finely chopped
4 each pieces prosciutto rind
1 single salt, to taste
1 single pepper, to taste
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese

There are as many versions of vegetable soup in Italy as there there
are cooks. Pancetta - Pancetta is the same cut of pork as bacon. It
is cured with salt and is not smoked.  It comes rolled up like a
large salami. Widely used in Italian cooking, especially in
Emilia-Romagna, it is vital to many dishes. If available, buy a large
quantity. Cut into several pieces and freeze it.  You can substitute
domestic bacon for pancetta. It must be blanched in boiling water for
two three minutes to reduce the smoky flavour.  Fresh side pork can
also be used. I'll be posting several recipes over the next while
that call for pancetta, so if you can find some, it won't go to
waste. Prepare chicken broth (see my previously posted recipe). Heat
oil in a large saucepan. Add parsley and garlic. Saute over medium
heat.  Before garlic changes colour, add pancetta. Saute until
lightly browned.  Stir in cabbage.  Cover and cook 1 to 2 minutes.
Add remaining vegetables to saucepan. Cover and cook about 5 minutes.
Add broth and water, if using, and prosciutto rind or ham shank.
Cover and reduce heat. Simmer 40 to 50 minutes. Remove half the
vegetables with a slotted spoon. Place in a blender or food processor
and process until smooth. Return to saucepan. Season with salt and
pepper. Serve hot with Parmesan cheese sprinkled over top. Makes 8 to
10 servings. VARIATION: Toast about 20 thick slices of Italian bread.
Place 2 slices in each soup bowl and sprinkle generously with
Parmesan cheese. Ladle soup into bowls. Serve with additional
Parmesan cheese.

1  cucumbers, small, sliced
1  peas, blanched

Vegetable Stock: ================

At least 8 - 10 hours before serving, place all of the
ingredients in a stockpot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil,
skim, and simmer for 20 minutes.

Strain the liquid, return to heat, and reduce it by one-fourth.
Skim carefully during the reducing process. Remove from heat and
measure the remaining liquid. For each 2 cups of hot stock, add 1
tablespoon gelatin dissolved in 2 tablespoons of cold water. Add salt
and white pepper to taste.

Pour into a flat pan and chill for 2 - 3 hours.

For the Garnish: ================

Use any combination of 4 or 5 cold fresh seasonal vegetables, cut
thinly and shredded.

Remove the jelly from the refrigerator half an hour before
serving. Let it stand at room temperature to warm slightly (if it is
served too cold, the flavor will be lost).

To serve, scatter small amounts of vegetable garnish in soup
bowls. Break jelly into irregular pieces with a fork and place on top
of garnish. For each person, use 1/2 cup. Top with fresh herbs, such
as chives, basil, or tarragon.

If available, add edible flowers such as borage, onion, or
nasturtium petals.  Serve within 5 minutes, since jelly begins to
lose form if held longer.

Preparation time:  2 hours (elapsed time)

beans in a large saucepan with water to cover, bring to a boil,
cover, remove from heat, and let stand for 1 hour; drain.) Peel and
mince the garlic. Peel and coarsely chop the tomato. Cut the fennel
into 1/4-inch dice. Rinse spinach and Swiss chard and cut into
1/2-inch julienne strips. Peel potatoes and carrots; leave whole.
Grate the cheese (1 1/2 cups).

COOKING:  Put drained beans in a large saucepan; add ham hocks and 2
quarts water.  Bring to a boil, partially cover, and simmer for 20
minutes; drain.

Bring 2 quarts of water to boil in a 6-quart soup kettle, add fennel,
spinach and Swiss chard, and simmer until vegetables are tender,
about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.

Heat oil in soup kettle.  Add garlic and saute until golden, about 1
minute.  Add the tomato and cook over low heat until tomato liquid
evaporates, about 10 minutes. Add the beans, hocks, broth , and bay
leaf. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 30 minutes.  Add whole
potatoes and carrots, cover and simmer until they are tender, about
30 minutes longer. Transfer potatoes and carrots to a large plate and
mash with a potato masher.  Return mashed mixture to the kettle, and
stir in the spinach mixture, corn, and peas. Bring soup to a boil,
then simmer, stirring and skimming foam from surface occasionally,
until peas and corn are tender, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt,
if necessary.

SERVING:  Ladle soup into warm bowls.  Sprinkle with ground pepper and
cheese.

Makes 10 to 12 main course servings.

Vegetable Soup With Goulash Taste

low cal, soups, vegetables

6 deciliter water
150 gm yellow onion; chopped
150 gm turnip; cut in small cubes
200 gm squash; cut in small cubes
200 gm carrot; shredded
50 gm tomato; cut in small pieces
4 deciliter tomato juice
2 deciliter water
2  meat extract cubes; should be enough to make
1  salt
1  white pepper
1  basil; *

* Use wathever you like from spices and herbs. I usually add some
"taco table spicemix", some oregano and some black pepper.

Bring the water to a boil together with the meat extract cubes. Add
vegetables and tomato juice. Add more water, put the water into the
tomato juice packet and shake so you get all of the juice out of it.
Let simmer until everything get really mixed and you can't really see
what is what. Mix a little water with flour, add, stir well and let
boil for a couple of minutes.

These are pretty large servings, and noone has to be hungry after
eating... You can replace almost all the vegetables with something
else, it should be a total of about 800 g vegetables, that's the main
"rule" in this recipe...

If you are a Weight Watcher one portion will take about 10 extra
calories from your weekly amount of extra calories , NOTHING ELSE...
guess if I love this recipe!

Vegetable-Bean Soup

beans, potato, soups

1 cup kidney beans; dried
2  garlic cloves; pressed
1  onion; chopped
2  potato; cut in chunks
1  carrot; sliced 1/2 thick
2  zucchini; sliced 1 thick
1/4 lb green beans
2  leek
1/4 lb cabbage
1  (savoy is best)
1/3 cup brown rice, long-grain; * se
3  tomato; cut in wedges
1/4 cup parsley sprigs; chopped
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1/4 teaspoon marjoram
1 teaspoon basil
1 teaspoon oregano

Recipe by: McDougall Place beans in pot with 2 quarts of water. Bring
to boil, remove from heat and let rest 1 hour. Then add chopped
onion, garlic, and simmer for
1 1/2    hours.

Chop potatoes in large chunks; do not peel. Slice carrots 1/2 inch and
zucchini 1 inch thick, scrub them, do not peel. Slice leeks and cut
beans into 1 inch pieces. Add to soup pot along with seasonings.
Simmer for 1 hour longer.

Thinly slice cabbage and add to soup along with rice or spaghetti.
Simmer another 20 minutes. Add more water if too thick. Add tomato
wedges for the last 10 minutes, just before serving.

HELPFUL HINTS: Kidney beans make a good rich broth, but any kind of
bean also may be used. Soup freezes well, so make a large batch when
you have time and freeze half for use on a budy day. Try using some
chopped spinach, instead of the cabbage. By changing the vegetables
and beans used, the soup can be different each time you make it. It
is a meal in itself. From the collection of Sue Smith, S.Smith34,

Vegetarian Chili #2

cyberealm, nets

2 1/2 cup kidney beans, dried, soaked
3 teaspoon salt
1 cup tomato juice
1 cup bulghur, raw
2 tablespoon olive oil
2 medium onions, coarsely chopped
4 medium garlic cloves, crushed
3  celery stalks, coarse  chopped
3  carrots, coarsely chopped
4  tomatoes, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon lemon juice, fresh
2 tablespoon red chile, hot, ground
3 tablespoon red chile, mild, ground
1 teaspoon cumin, ground
1/2 teaspoon oregano, dried, preferably  mexican
1 teaspoon basil, dried
1  black pepper, freshly ground
1 1/2  bell pepper(s)

1. Transfer the kidney beans and the water in which they were soaked
to a large heavy saucepan. Add 1 teaspoon of the salt and bring to a
boil over high heat. Lower the heat and continue boiling the beans,
partially covered, until tender, about 1 hour. Watch the water level
and add more, if necessary, to keep the beans from scorching.

2. Meanwhile, place the tomato juice in another saucepan and bring to
a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat immediately and add the
bulghur to the juice. Cover and let stand for 15 minutes. It should
be slightly crunchy. Set aside.

3. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add the
onions and garlic and cook until the onions are translucent. Add the
celery, carrots, tomatoes, lemon juice, and all the spices -
including the remaining salt - to the onions and cook, covered, until
the vegetables are nearly tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the
bell peppers and continue cooking another 10 minutes.

4. Add the kidney beans, the water in which they cooked, and the
bulghur to the vegetables in the large pot. Stir the mixture
thoroughly and simmer for 30 minutes over low heat. The chili may be
thick - add water as necessary and stir occasionally making sure the
bulghur does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Taste and adjust
seasonings.

A BAG OF BEAN TRICKS:

A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.

Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways
of preparing dry beans for cooking. All start with a thorough
inspection for damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in
cold water. The next step, which is highly recommended, is soaking
the beans. This not only helps make the beans cook faster, it also
improves flavor, texture, appearance and digestibility. For maximum
improvement of these factors, it is recommended that the soak water
be discarded and the beans rinsed and cooked in fresh water.

SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.

For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so
be sure to start with a large enough pot. (Note: up to 2 teaspoons of
salt per pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water
more evenly.) Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
from heat, cover and set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak
method), but *preferably* four hours or more.  The longer soaking
time is recommended to allow a greater amount of the gas-causing
properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping the beans to be
more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects. Whether you soak
the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to DISCARD THE SOAK
WATER.

COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)

Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
teaspoons salt. Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness
is reached.

Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons
onion salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt. Add 1
Tablespoon chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4
teaspoon white pepper.

* Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.

* Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.

* Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans whe
cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.

* At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker
helps, but follow manufacturer's directions. [Personal note: Tom says
1/2 hour in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to
cooking them overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure
cooker, as they expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)

* Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or
kidney beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings,
lard, oil, butter or margarine.

Velvet Vegetable Soup

soup/stew

1  head broccoli
4 cup rough chopped * any
1  vegetables
1 cup onions, chopped
1 large baking potato, scrubbed
1  and diced
3 cup packages herb-ox low
1  salt chicken stock
2 tablespoon olive oil
1  stalk cellery, chopped
1  carrot, chopped
1  salt,
1  pepper,
1/2 teaspoon thyme,
1  tarragon

Saute onions, carrots and celery in large pot with oil. Saute until
translucent, then carmelized (turns light brown. Add chopped
vegetables, water to cover vegetables. Add chicken packets, stir in
thyme, and pepper and bring to boil. Lower heat and simmer for 30-45
minutes.

Place in blender a cup or so at a time. Puree each batch and empty
into large bowl. Rinse pot, replace soup mixture and again bring to
simmer again for a few minutes, stirring occassionally.

Note: At this stage, we allow the mixture to sit until it cools
slightly and divide the soup into 3 equal portions. The soup freeezs
excellently and we do that with 2 of the portions.

Variations: Place the basic soup into a pot. Simmer and bring to a
boil. Add a quarter cup of milk either regular or skimmed) and bring
to boil again.  To add texture to the mix, add diced potatoes and
carrots. *Serve with a pinch of dried tarragon*. A a dollop of no fat
yogurt adds additional smoothness.

If desired, substitute 1/2 cup of cooked fucilli instead of the
potato. You may also substitute frozen corn or peas.

Venison Goulash Soup

soups, game

5 1/2 lb lean venison, cut into 1 1/4-inch c; ubes
5 oz lard
5 1/2 lb onions, sliced
5 oz sweet paprika
1 tablespoon hot paprika
1 1/4 quart red wine
3 1/8 quart water
2 large potatoes, peeled and quartered
3  carrots, peeled and quartered
2  apples, peeled, cored and quartered
1  peppercorns
1  juniper berries
3  bay leaves
1  a few piment seeds (??)
3  stalks celery, thinly sliced
2 bunch parsley, chopped
1  sour cream to taste

Best made in large quantities.  Recipe therefor serves 12.

In a large pot, melt some of the lard and brown the meat in batches.
Add more lard as required.  Remove the meat and reserve. Fry onions
until browned. Remove onions from pot and reserve. Add remaining
lard. Add paprika and stir well.  Slowly add red wine and water,
continuing to stir to make sure there are no lumps of paprika. Add
meat and onions to pot again.  Add potatoes, carrots, apples and
spices. Quantities are approximate, use more, or less, as you wish.
Cook gently, covered, for 3 hours.  Check occasionally, and add more
water as required. Remove coarse spices, and add celery and parsley.
Serve with a bowl of sour cream, so each person can help themselves.

NOTE:  This recipe does not mention salt, or pepper, which in my
opinion ought to be included.

Venison Savory Stew

soups

2 lb venison roast (boneless)
1/2 cup white wine
1/8 cup worcestershire sauce
1 cup lentils
1 each large cucumber, diced
1 each jalepeno pepper, diced
6 each med bannana peppers, chopped
4 each small potatoes, quartered
1 each indiv box of fiber one
1 pkg top ramen beef fl.noodles
4 each triscuit snack crackers
1/4 pkg ranch dip mix(-sourcream)

Do not skin, peel, or otherwise denude the vegetables or potatoes.
Wash them briskley and then cut them up. The good stuff is in the
skin, always, as the skin is what was intended to serve, protect and
defend the pulp and seeds. Fill large crock pot half full of clean
cold water. Add ingredients. Let cook on low heat for 12-16 hours.
Season as desired during last 1 hour of cooking, adding bay, etc., as
suits your individual collection of buds. This recipe may be done
with any game animal, except that squirrel tends to be far too
stringy for my taste. If you like hearty and thick, this stew is for
you.  It would also go well with beef, obviously.
I do recommend a bay leaf added to the top for the last hour.

Very Simple Mushroom Soup

soups, vegetarian

1 each text file

Given that morel season is here, I thought I would post a recipe for
wild mushroom soup. This might work with regular mushrooms but I've
only made them with fresh wild ones. Boletes aka the Porcini to be
exact. If you can get them, they make a simply sublime soup. This
recipe is from Joe's Book of Mushroom Cookery.

Clean mushrooms well. Barely cover with water in a saucepan. Turn the
heat on and cover the pot with a tight fitting lid. When the water
comes to a boil, turn it down to a simmer for 10 minutes. The
mushrooms will have given off their liquid and literally made their
own soup. For every 2 cups of liquid, add 1 tsp each of salt and
sugar and 1 tbl soy sauce. Add 4-5 scallions, sliced thin and 1/3 cup
shoestring potatoes. The soup is finished when the potatoes are
cooked.

4  vidalia onions, sliced
1  stick margarine or butter
1 can chicken broth
1 can beef broth
2 can water
1 cup shredded mozzerella cheese
1  slices hard italian bread

Saute onions in margarine for 20 minutes, add broths and water and let
simmer another 20-30 minutes. Put one slice of bread in each bowl,
sprinkle with 2-3 Tbs cheese. Ladle soup over the top. It melts the
cheese, no broiler hassle and it tastes as good as any I have had

would taste good with the margarine).

Soak bone overnight in cold water.  Place bones, oxtails and flank

Cook 10 minutes, drain and rinse pot and bones. Return bones to pot,
add 6 quarts water and bring to a boil.  Skim surface of scum and
fat. Stir bones at bottom from time to time. Add 3 more quarts water,
bring to a boil again and skim scum.  Lower heat and let simmer.

in stock with parsnips and salt. Simmer for 1 hour. Remove flank
steak and continue simmering broth, uncovered pot, for 4-5 hours.
Add more water if level goes below bones.

Meanwhile, slice beef sirloin against grain into paper-thin slices,
about 2-by-2 inches.  Slice flank steak the same way. Set aside. In a
small bowl, combine scallions, cilantro, and half the sliced onions.
Place remaining onions in another bowl and mix in hot chili sauce.
Soak rice noodles in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.

When broth is ready, discard bones.  Strain broth through a colander
lined with a double layer of damp cheesecloth into a clean pot. Add
fish sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer. In another
pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil.  Add noodles and drain
immediately. Do not overcook noodles. Divide among 4 large soup
bowls. Top noodles with sliced meats. Bring broth to a rolling boil,
then ladle into soup bowls. Garnish with scallions mixture and black
pepper. Serve the onions in hot chili sauce and remaining ingredients
on the side to add as desired. Also, you can add Hoisin sauce as a
dip. Serves 4.

Watercress Soup

herbs

1  watercress bunch
1/2 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 medium potato, roughly diced
1/2  garlic clove, chopped
1/2 oz butter (or your favourite oil or ma; rgarine)
3 cup water
1 tablespoon heavy cream (or whipping cream)
1 oz black caviar (lump fish roe is fine; )
4  water biscuits (bite-size)
1 pinch salt and pepper (to taste)

Gently fry onion and garlic in a small amount of butter until
transparent. Season lightly with salt and pepper, and add water and
potato and boil until soft.

Pick over watercress and chop 4 or five sprigs and set them aside.
Put onion and potato mixture in blender and puree. Add most of
watercress, blend, re-season to taste and return to heat.

Bring mixture to boil and simmer for 2 or three minutes.  Stir gently
to prevent soup from sticking to bottom.  Remove from heat.

This is the decision point.  Either set aside to cool, then chill, or
carry on to serve the soup hot.

Stir in cream and chopped watercress.  Heap a teaspoon of caviar on
each of the water biscuits and float one on each bowl of soup
immediately prior to serving.

NOTES:

*  Watercress soup, hot or cold -- This thick, creamy soup is equally
good whether served hot or cold.  I have had watercress soup in
restaurants, and my mother sometimes makes it, too, but this recipe
is my own interpretation of the idea. Yield: Serves 4.

*  Use the minimum amount of butter, oil, or margarine that will turn
the onion transparent.  Those who are particularly diet-conscious
could dispense with this step, and with the cream. Don't overdo the
garlic, 1/2 a small clove is ample since it is a background flavour,
not one that you should be aware of.

*  A caution regarding seasoning.  Potatoes absorb a lot of salt so
you may find it under-salted.  The caviar on the other hand, is very
salty.  This, for me, is a delightful and important contrast. Guests
can always add extra salt if they choose.

*  Water biscuits are made by Carr's, amongst others, and can be
found in most supermarkets, possibly in the gourmet food section.
They are variously known as water biscuits, water crackers and table
water crackers. To my mind the best for eating with cheese are the
high-bake ones, but the regular type are better for this recipe. If
you can't find them, then any round dry bland low-salt cracker will
do.

*  A 2 oz jar of lumpfish caviar costs a little under $3.00, but it
does keep in the fridge so you can get two batches of four servings
from one jar.  I suppose if budget is a prime consideration one could
dispense with the caviar, too, but that would be like serving a
martini without the olives. (Treasonable.)

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes of preparation, 1/2 hour of simmering.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

A BAG OF BEAN TRICKS:

A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.

Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways
of preparing dry beans for cooking. All start with a thorough
inspection for damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in
cold water. The next step, which is highly recommended, is soaking
the beans. This not only helps make the beans cook faster, it also
improves flavor, texture, appearance and digestibility. For maximum
improvement of these factors, it is recommended that the soak water
be discarded and the beans rinsed and cooked in fresh water.

SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.

For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so
be sure to start with a large enough pot. (Note: up to 2 teaspoons of
salt per pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water
more evenly.) Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
from heat, cover and set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak
method), but *preferably* four hours or more.  The longer soaking
time is recommended to allow a greater amount of the gas-causing
properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping the beans to be
more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects. Whether you soak
the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to DISCARD THE SOAK
WATER.

COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)

Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
teaspoons salt. Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness
is reached.

Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons
onion salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt. Add 1
Tablespoon chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4
teaspoon white pepper.

* Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.

* Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.

* Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans whe
cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.

* At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker
helps, but follow manufacturer's directions. [Personal note: Tom says
1/2 hour in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to
cooking them overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure
cooker, as they expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)

* Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or
kidney beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings,
lard, oil, butter or margarine.

White & Green Bean Soup

beans, soups

1 1/2 cup dried white beans, great northern,; navy, or baby lima
6 cup water
3  cloves garlic, chopped
2 teaspoon salt
4 cup beef broth
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon rosemary, crumbled
2 cup fresh green beans (about 3/4 lb), c; ut on the
1  diagonal in 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon butter
1  juice of 1/2 lemon

Wash and pick over the dried beans.  Put them into a large saucepan or
kettle with the water and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat,
cover, and allow to stand for 1 hour.

Return to the heat and bring to a boil again.  Reduce heat and simmer,
partially covered, for 1/2 hour. Using a heavy fork, mash the garlic
with the salt until no large chunks remain. Add to the saucepan with
the beans. Add the broth, pepper, and rosemary.

Simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender. This can take 15
minutes or as long as 1 hour; timing for beans is hard to predict -
keep checking.

Soup can be made ahead to this point, and refrigerated or frozen after
thorough cooling.

Cook the green beans uncovered in 2 uarts of boiling salted water
until they are tender-crisp and bright green. Drain and add to the
soup when the white beans are tender but not mushy. If green beans
are not to be added right away, rinse in cold water to retain color.
Stir in the butter and lemon.  Serve at once, while green beans are
still bright.

Note:  If you want some of the soup pureed, do it before adding the
green beans - the color will be better.

Serves 6 to 8.

White Clam Chowder With Leeks

clams, soups

24  quahogs (3 cups chopped meat and li; quor)
3 cup dry white wine
2 cup (approx) fish stock, clam broth or; water
6  leeks, trimmed and washed
2  onions
4  stalks celery
3 oz salt pork
6  strips bacon
1/3 cup flour
3 large potatoes, peeled and diced
1  bouquet garni of bay leaf, thyme an; d parsley
1  salt, pepper and cayenne pepper
2 cup peanut oil for frying the leeks
1 cup heavy cream
4 tablespoon finely chopped chives or parsley
3 tablespoon butter

This chowder has two twists: bacon is added in addition to salt pork
and fried julienned leeks are used as a garnish. The recipe comes
from Ris Lacoste, chef at 21 Federal St. in Washington.

Scrub the quahogs and place them in a large, covered pot with the
wine. Steam them for 10 to 15 minutes or until the shells just open.
Shuck the quahogs and grind with a meat grinder or food processor.
Strain the cooking liquid through damp cheesecloth - you should have
2 quarts. If you don'y, add fish stock, clam broth or water to make
up the difference. Reserve the ground clams and the liquid separately.

Finely chop three of the leeks.  Cut the remaining three leeks into
fine julienne and reserve them for the garnish. Finely chop the onion
and celery. Finely dice the salt pork and bacon. Fry the salt pork
and bacon in a large pot over medium heat to render the fat. Remove
the cracklings with a slotted spoon. Discard all but 6 tablespoons of
the fat.

White Or Veal Stock

meats, sauces, vegetables, soup/stew

5 lb veal bones, cut up
10 cup cold water
2 large onions, quartered
3 large carrots, scrubbed, unpeeled, and
1  cut up
1  stalk celery, split
3 large leeks, well washed and split.
1  several sprigs of fresh thyme
1  several sprigs of fresh parsley
10  whole peppercorns

White stock is generally used as a base for delicately flavored
sauces. This stock adds little or no color to the final sauce.

Place the bones and water in a large stock kettle. Bring to a boil
and skim well.  Add the remaining ingredients, turn the heat down to
low, and simmer for 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Strain through a cheesecloth
lined strainer and allow to cool; then skim off the fat, and chill.
The cold stock will be quite gelatinous.

Yield:  About 6 cups.

I checked the subject list under Asian Cooking, and didn't see any I

and add ribs, broth, water, soy, sugar, garlic, ginger,pepper, and
whole onions. Bring to a boil over med. heat;cover, reduce heat, and
simmer till beef is tender (2 1/2 -3 hrs.) Lift out ribs, and let
cool. Lift out and discard ginger and onions. Skim and discard fat
from broth. When ribs are cool, discard bones and fat; then shred
meat with fingers. Return meat to broth and add daikon. Bring to boil
over med. high heat;cover,reduce heat,and simmer till daikon is
tender to > bite (10-15 min.). Add oil. Gently break eggs, one at a
time, into barely simmering broth;cover and cook just till eggs are
softly set ( about 2 min.). Ladle soup and eggs into individual
bowls, and sprinkle sliced onions over top. Makes 3 or 4 servings. I
hope this helps. I haven't had this for a while, and I'm waiting for

1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley

Wild Rice & Red Onion Soup

onion, rice, soups

3/4 cup raw wild rice
1 teaspoon salt
2 lb red onions
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 quart chicken stock
1 cup parmesan cheese; freshly grated

1.   Wash the wild rice by placing it in a 1-quart saucepan filled
with water.  Stir the rice around in the water until the liquid
darkens. Drain the rice through a sieve.
Rinse the saucepan and add 1-1/2 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon of
the salt.  Bring to a boil and add the rice. Turn the heat to low,
cover the saucepan, and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes until the liquid
has evaporated.
Check the rice several times while it is cooking and fluff it with
a fork.  Set aside, still covered, until it is time to add it to the
soup.

2.   Peel and slice the onions.  They should be about 1/8" thick.
Slice them on the bias to avoid rings.

3.  In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil.  Add the onions and the
remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Toss to coat the onions with the oil.
Cover, and over low heat, "sweat" the onions for 20 minutes. During
this time, the onions will become limp and give off their liquid.

4.  Remove the cover and turn the heat to medium.  Add the sugar,
butter, rosemary, and black pepper.  Toss to mix. Continue cooking
uncovered foir another 15 minutes or so until the onions are very
lightly browned. Begin warming your soup plates.

5.  Increase the heat and add the wine.  Bring to a full simmer and
cook until the wine has almost evaporated. Stir to make sure that the
onions do not burn.

6.  Add the chicken stock, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Just
before serving, add the wild rice and cook only long enough to heat
the rice.

7.  Serve the soup in heated soup plates, sprinkling each serving
with 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese.

Winter Squash Soup With Cinnamon And Cloves

dec., digest

2 lb dense winter squash such as
1  butternut (we used pumpkin)
12  corriander seeds
12  peppercorns
2 cup fatfree soymilk (we used the
1  westbrae westsoy)
1  3 inch cinnamon stick,
1  broken into pieces
8  cloves
1  jalapeno pepper or 2 small
1  dried red chilies, seeds
1  removed
1  onion, finely diced
2 teaspoon each finely chopped mint and
1  cilantro for garnish (we
1  skipped this)

Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds.  Cook the squash (We
put it in the microwave, but she recommends baking it at 375 for
30-45 minutes. We were afraid it'd dry out too much that way.) When
the squash is cooked and cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh.

While the squash is baking, make an infusion with the herbs and milk:
first lightly crush the corriander seeds and peppercorns; then put
them in a saucepan with the milk, cinnamon, cloves, and chilies. Heat
the mixture slowly, but turn off the heat just before the milk comes
to a boil Let it stand until needed.

Saute the onions in water until they begin to soften. Add the squash
and 1 qt. water.  Bring to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer
until the squash is broken up, about 25 minutes.

Pass the soup through a food mill or blen it briefly, leaving as much
texture as you like.  Return the soup to the stove and add the milk,
pouring it through a strainer. Try to press on the spices as you do,
to get as much flavor into the soup as you can.  Gently reheat the
soup, but do not allow it to boil.  Serve garnished with cilantro and
mint.

1/2 medium cabbage, savoy, cored, - coarsely c; hopped
2 medium turnips, white, peeled - chopped
1 medium fennel, bulb, chopped
1 medium kohlrabi, peeled, coarsely - choppe; d (opt)
1 medium celery, root, (celeriac), - pared,; coarsely chopped
3  broccoli, stalks, coarsely - cut up
12  parsley, italian, sprigs - (cilantr; o)
10 cup stock, chicken **
3 cup cream, whipping
1  salt (to taste)
1  pepper (to taste)
1  cream, sour (garnish)
1  chives, fresh, chopped, - (garnish)

** Recipes for this ingredient can be found elsewhere in this
database.

:    In a large saucepan or casserole, heat up the butter over
medium-low heat.  Add the onion, leek, celery, garlic and jalapeno
chili. Cook, covered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

:    Add the carrots, cabbage, potatoes, turnips, fennel, kohlrabi,
celery root, broccoli, parsley, and enough stock to nearly cover.
Bring the contents to a boil; lower heat and simmer, uncovered, for
30 minutes or until very tender.

:    Puree the soup, working in batches as necessary, in a processor
or blender.  Rinse out the pan, pour the soup back into the saucepan,
and bring the soup to a simmer.  Add cream and salt and pepper to
taste; heat back up to simmer.  Serve with garnish of sour cream and
chives.

NOTE: =====

:    At Thanksgiving dinner at The Four Seasons, this soup is served
in a hollowed-out acorn squash.  To serve it this way, slice off the
tops and a thin sliver from the bottom of the acorn squash (this is
so the squash can "sit up" on its own) then hollow out the insides.

:    Pour in the finished soup and bake on a baking sheet, uncovered,
at 375 F until the squash is tender, about 30 minutes.  The squash
will be tender enough to be scraped from the shell and eaten with the
soup.

:    The vegetables in this soup can be varied according to what is in
season, as long as you maintain the proportion of solids to liquid.

Winter Warmer Soup

soups

1 large spanish onion
2 large carrots
1 medium turnip/swede
1 lb leeks
1  potatoes
1  handful pearl barley/rice
1  cube vegetable stock
1 teaspoon dried mixed herbs
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  tomato puree optional

Fill a very large saucepan with lid, if possible 2/3 full with cold
water and put it on to boil. This will take a long time, so peel and
chop or slice the onion, carrots, turnip/swede and potatoes. Trim the
leeks, slice down one side, and rinse them thoroughly in cold running
water. Chop them into 1/2 inch rings. Stir the stock cube into the
boiling water. Add all the prepared vegetables, the mixed herbs, and
the pearl barley or rice as you like. Turn down the heat and simmer
gently, stirring occasionally, until the potato has cooked enough to
thicken the soup and all the other vegetables are tender, but still
recognizable. It needs about 40 minutes. Add more water if required,
a little at a time. Adjust flavor with salt and pepper, and tomato
puree if liked.

Won Ton Soup

chinese, soups

30  won ton filled according to won ton; recipe
1 cup roast pork, sliced
1 quart chicken and pork stock [or either o; ne. s.c.]
2  stalks green onions, minced
1 teaspoon sesame oil [the dark, cooked orient; al type. s.c.]

You can fiddle with the ingredients to your hearts content. Roast
pork is available at Chinese markets and you could probably get it to
go at Chinese restaurants.  Or try meat from good ol' American BBQ
ribs, slivered. Or thinly sliced raw chicken.  Or thinly sliced
shrimp or scallops. Or no meat at all...

Yield: 4 servings

PREPARATION:

Prepare won ton filling and wrap as in won ton recipe. Heat stock.

COOKING:

Bring a pot of water to a boil.  Add won ton and boil for 4 to 5
minutes. Remove won ton with bamboo skimmer or slotted spoon and
transfer to soup bowls.  Garnish with roast pork and green onions.
Pour heated stock over won ton.  Drizzle sesame oil over won ton and
serve.

DO-AHEAD NOTES;

Wrap and freeze won ton.  Drop frozen won ton directly into boiling
water and boil for 5 to 6 minutes.

COMMENTS:

Unless you're Chinese you probably don't know what won ton means.
"Won" means cloud and "Ton" means swallow. Since won ton wrappers are
light and fragile as clouds, biting onto won ton is like swallowing a
cloud.

1 tablespoon finely minced garlic
2 tablespoon tomato paste
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup dry white wine

oven over high heat on top of the stove. Add the meat, without
crowding, in batches if necessary, and brown well on all sides.
Remove pieces to a plate as they are done and reserve. Repeat until
all meat is browned. Pour off any remaining fat, and replace the
casserole over medium heat. Add the onion, half the carrots, celery,
garlic and tomato paste. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Use
your spoon to loosen and dissolve the brown bits stuck to the bottom
of the casserole. Add flour and cook, stirring, an additional minute.

water is evaporated, leaving the vegetables bathed in butter, about
another 5 minutes. Add the peas, remove from the heat and set aside.
Remove the casserole from the oven. Using a slotted spoon, remove the
meat from the sauce and place it in a bowl. Pour the sauce through a
fine strainer into another bowl and discard the vegetables and spices
that remain in the strainer. Replace meat in the pot, add the cooked
vegetables and the sauce. Cover and place over medium heat for 5
minutes. Serve piping hot.

Yellow Watermelon Soup

appetizers, soup/stew

7 1/2 lb watermelon -- yellow-flesh,
1  chill
1 cup raspberries -- chilled
1  garnish options--
3 oz prosciutto -- thinly sliced
1 bunch thompson seedless grapes --
1  red or green, halved
1/4 cup fresh mint leaves -- minced
1/4 cup carrot -- finely shredded
1  orange zest -- long strands

Cut watermelon into pieces. Trim off rind; discard. Discard seeds. In
batches, puree watermelon flesh in a blender or food processor or by
hand [1].  Pour into a bowl and set aside in the refrigerator to
chill. [2]

Rinse berries, drain, then puree in a blender or processor. Rub puree
through a strainer to collect and discard seeds. [2]

Optional:  Cut prosciutto into very thin shreds. Place shreds in a
10-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir often until
prosciutto is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper
towels until cool.

ASSEMBLY -  Pour melon puree equally into 6 or 4 bowls. With a small
spoon, dollop raspberry puree in a circle, spacing drops well apart
and adding equally small amount to each portion. With the tip of a
skewer or small knife, pull through the raspberry dots, drawing them
out into swirls through yellow puree. Sprinkle with prosciutto and
mint [3] or one-or-more of the other meatless garnishes. (Can serve
8.)

[1] The round, seedless watermelon is first available late-April.
These and other nearly 100%-water melons liquify when processed. Test
first: crush by hand. If the strands start to disintegrate, mash by
hand. The soup needs some body. [2] May be chilled up to 1 day in
advance. [3] Use a fresh herb to splash the soup with some green.
(I've used cilantro and red seedless grapes.)

Yetakelt W'et (Spicy Mixed Vegetable Stew)

stews

1 cup onions, finely chopped
2  garlic cloves, pressed
1 tablespoon berbere (dry)
1 tablespoon sweet hungarian paprika
1/4 cup niter kebbeh
1 cup green beans, cut in thirds
1 cup carrots, chopped
1 cup potatoes, cubed
1 cup tomatoes, chopped
1/4 cup tomato paste
2 cup vegetable stock
1  salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley(opt)

Saute the onions, garlic, berbere, and paprika in the niter kebbeh
for 2 minutes.  Add the beans, carrots, and potatoes and continue to
saute for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.
Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and vegetable stock.  Bring
to a boil and then simmer for 15 minutes, or until all of the
vegetables are tender. [personal comment: we simmered more like 40
minutes, until it eventually thickened.]

Add salt and pepper to taste.  Mix in the parsley (optional).

Serve with injera and yogurt or cottage cheese.

Copied from "Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant", the Moosewood
Collective, ISBN 0-671-67989-9.

Comment from book: Try making this dish and Yemiser W'et for the same
meal. In Ethiopia, it is customary to offer several stews at one
time, and people eat some of each kind.

Comments from the Shipps: Don't stop with just two dishes, make a
banquet. You will need several friends to help eat it all, but it
will make for a very interesting and satisfying evening. The
Moosewood book describes how to make a hearty vegetable stock.  We
have found a vegetarian vegetable bouillon made by Knorr that is a
reasonable substitute with much less effort.

Yunnan Steamed Pot Chicken

chinese, soups

4 lb chicken, cut into pieces
1 teaspoon salt
6 slice fresh ginger
2  scallions, cut into 2-inch  pieces
3 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry
      ----DIPPING SAUCES----
1  light soy sauce
1  chili bean sauce
1  chopped scallions

To make this soup, you can use a Yunnan ceramic steam pot, a squat,
rounded lidded vessel with an internal spout that allows steam to
circulate but not escape. A heat-proof casserole works almost as well.

BLANCH THE CHICKEN for 3 minutes in a large pot of boiling water.
Remove the chicken and rinse thoroughly in cold running water. Place
the chicken pieces around the Yunnan pot or on a rack set into a
heat-proof casserole. Sprinkle the chicken with the salt, and scatter
the ginger pieces and scallions over the top. Pour in the chicken
stock and rice wine or sherry. Cover and gently steam on stove for 2
hours, replenishing the hot water from time to time if needed. Remove
the ginger and scallion pieces. With a spoon, skim off all the
surface fat. Ladle the soup into a tureen, and pass the chicken on a
platter with dipping sauces.

1 lb ground beef, veal or lamb
1  onion; grated
2  garlic cloves; crushed (opt)
6 tablespoon raw long-grain white rice
1  chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoon chopped dill, mint or basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano or thyme
1  salt & freshly ground pepper
3  eggs
5 cup water or stock
1  onion (optional); chopped
1  celery stalk (opt.); chopped
1/2  carrot (optional); chopped
1  lemon (or more), juice only

In a large bowl, combine the meat, grated onion, garlic, rice, 3
tablespoons chopped parsley, the mint, oregano, salt and pepper, and
1 egg, slightly beaten. Knead for a few minutes, then shape into
walnut- sized barrels and set aside. In a soup pot, bring the water
or stock to boil with the chopped onion, celery and carrot, and salt
and pepper to taste. Lower the heat and add the meat-rice barrels.
Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, then remove from the heat. To
prepare avgolemono, beat the two remaining eggs for 2 minutes.
Continuing to beat, gradually add the lemon juice. Then add 1 cup of
the hot broth by droplets, beating steadily, until all has been
added. Add to the soup and heat, being careful not to let it boil.
Serve hot, garnished with parsley. Note: This soup is frequently made
without the additional vegetables added to the liquid. Also, you may

about 1/4 inch wide and 2 inches long 2 cups finely chopped onions
Combine the 2 coarsely chopped green peppers and the chilies, garlic,
ginger root, turmeric, cardamom, salt, white pepper and wine in the
jar of an electric blender. Blend at high speed for 30 seconds, then
turn off the machine, scrape down the sides of the jar with a rubber
spatula, and blend again until the mixture is a smooth puree. In a
heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet, heat 1/2 cup of the niter kebbeh over
moderate heat until a drop of water flicked into it splutters
instantly. Brown the strips of beef in the skillet, a handful at a
time, turning them about with a slotted spoon and regulating the heat
so that they colour richly and evenly on all sides without burning.

Shake the pan and stir the onions constantly to prevent them from
burning; if necessary, reduce the heat or remove the casserole from
the stove occassionally to let it cool for a few moments before
returning it to the heat. Pour in the reserved cooking fat and, when
it begins to splutter, add the green pepper strips.  Stirring
constantly, cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the pepper is soft. Add
the reserved green pepper puree and, still stirring, bring to a boil.
Return the beef and the liquid that has accumulated around it to the
skillet and turn it about in the sauce to coat the pieces evenly.
Reduce the heat to low, cover partially, and simmer for 6 to 8
minutes, or until the beef is cooked to your taste. Serve it at once

1 cup chicken; (white meat only)
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 each kamaboko; (fish or ham gelat
1 each carrot
3 each oriental taro
1/2 cup dashi
1/2 teaspoon shoyu
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 each spinach or watercress
1 single yuzu skin; (1emon or lime sk
12 each mochi (rice cake)
6 cup dashi
1 tablespoon shoyu

C       T  salt Gail some time ago you requested some information
about Ozoni the Japanese National Dish for New Years. There are
probably as many recipes for Zoni as there are cooks busy preparing
the dish but they are all fairly similar. Slice the chicken very thin
and sprinkle with the cornstarch. Then pound the chicken with the
back of a knife to enlarge the pieces. Boil in water for 5 minutes
Slice the Kamaboko into 6 pieces 1/4 inch thick Slice the carrot into
thin slices and after peeling the taro slice them into thin round
slices. Boil the carrots and taro in 1/2 C of dashi. When soft add
1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp shoyu. Boil the spinach or watercress in hot
water being sure to remove them from the boiling water when still
very green. Cut the greens into 1 inch lengths. Slice the Yazu into
thin strips to represent pine needles. Toast the Rice cakes. Boil 6
cups of dashi and flavor with the 1 tbs. salt and the 1 Tbs. shoyu.
Add the Kamaboko, carrots , taro and the greens. Place two pieces of
the toasted Mochi, two slices of the chicken, 1 slice of the carrot,
2 slices of taro, 1 slice of the kamaboko and a little of the greens
in each of six bowls Pour the hot soup over them and then float the
yazu needles on the top. Naturally any good Japanese family in Japan
would have had a drink of the special TOSO wine prior to the Zoni.
With the master of the house drinking first, then the mistress
followed by the children and the the servants last. This wine laced
with medicinal herbs and spices is believed to have disease
dispelling qualities and is similar to the wines served on New Years
by several other countries in the world. Fuku-cha is another
manditory item in their New Years (it is the tea of Good fortune) and
can either be green tea or seaweed tea which is served in tiny cups
with a pickled plum in each of the cups as a protection from illness
during the coming year. These formal ritualistic observances of the
New Year are becomming less common throughout Japan now that they
have had so much of the Western influence however in the rural areas
they are still followed religiously. It is a shame to see some of
these interesting observences gradually disappearing due to the
influence of the western world.

and 15 minutes. 4. Strain out the solids from the soup, and puree
them in a blender or food processor, along with enough broth to ease
things along. Return the puree to the soup and restore the boil. Add
the whipping cream, basil, thyme, salt, pepper and Tabasco. 5. Heat
the extra virgin olive oil in a skillet very hot. In it toast the
slivers of garlic until brown around the outside. 6 Ladle the soup
into bowls and garnish with roasted garlic slivers. Float a toasted,
garlic-buttered slice of French bread on top. Serves eight to twelve.
Suggested wine: Marinasco Chef Andrea Apuzzo writes of this recipe in
his book "La Cucina di Andrea's", "Garlic wears many hats. Most
people think of it in its aggressive, green, aromatic, sharp form.
But when garlic is cooked slowly for a long time, it takes on a sweet
nuttiness that is every bit as interesting as its more raw flavors.
The sweet side of garlic is exemplified by this soup." Andrea's
Restaurant 3100 Nineteenth Street Metaire, Louisiana 70002

Zuppa Di Asparagi (Calabrian Asparagus Soup)

italian, soups, vegetarian

2  garlic clove; minced
2 tablespoon olive oil; extra-virgin
2 lb asparagus; trimmed & cut into 1 piec
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper, black
4 cup vegetable broth; or
4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
4  eggs
1/2 cup parmesan; grated, plus extra for se
6 slice italian bread; toasted

In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over moderate
heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the
asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes. Add the salt,
pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to
moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender, about 15
minutes.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce the
heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly
ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking
constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into
the soup in the saucepan. Increase the heat to moderately low and
cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just thickens, about 8
minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs will curdle.
Remove from the heat.

Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the hot
soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.

Note:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian
cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from
day-old or slightly stale bread. Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.
