      Title: FRUITY FROZEN YOGURT
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    2/3 C  Sugar (or vary based                2 t  Lemon juice
           -on sweetness of fruit)             1 C  Yogurt, plain
    1/2 C  Orange juice                        2    Egg whites
      2 C  Fruit, cut into pieces         
 
  Combine sugar and orange juice in a saucepan.  Heat and stir until sugar is
  dissolved.  Set aside to cool.
  
  Whirl fruit and lemon juice in blender until fruit is pulp.  Add yogurt,
  blending well.  With motor running, add cooled orange juice mixture.
  
  Pour into a 9-inch square, flat pan and place in freezer for two hours or
  until mixture is frozen into a slush.  Break up mixture and put in mixer
  bowl. Beat until smooth, adding eggs one at a time. Continue beating until
  light and fluffy.
  
  Return to pan or freezer-proof dessert containers and freeze until firm,
  about one hour.
  
  For very juicy fruit, such as raspberries or frozen fruit, the orange juice
  may be decreased in proportion to the amount of juice.  Increase the lemon
  juice by 1 teaspoon for each 1/8 cup the orange juice is decreased.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A low-calorie frozen dessert with yogurt and fruit -- This refreshing
  and healthful dessert can be made with any of several types of fruit, such
  as bananas or strawberries, for a low calorie summer-time treat.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 3 hours freezing.

      1 lg Carrot, grated                      2 T  Dijon mustard
      1    Green pepper, finely            1 1/2 T  Sesame oil
           -chopped                            1 T  Tamari soy sauce
  1 1/2 t  Dried basil                         3    Tofu cakes, firm
      1 t  Ground fennel                            Black pepper
    3/4 t  Oregano, dried                 
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Saute the garlic, onion, carrot, pepper,
  basil, fennel and oregano in the oil for 10 minutes or until tender.
  
  In a large bowl, beat the eggs, then add all other ingredients except the
  tofu.  Mash the tofu and add it to the other ingredients.  Mix well.  Form
  the mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Spread on a greased baking sheet. Bake
  for 20-30 minutes at 350 degrees F. or until golden brown.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Vegetable and tofu "meatballs" -- This recipe comes from the New Recipes
  from Moosewood Restaurant cookbook.  They said that these vegetarian balls
  are "one of our most popular standard lunch items". I was skeptical, so I
  gave it a try and indeed, they are quite tasty.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking.

      Title: MANA'S SPINACH RICOTTA ROLL
 Categories: Entrees, Italian, Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     12 oz Spinach, cooked                 1 1/3 C  Water
           -(fresh or frozen)                1/2 C  Parmesan cheese,
      2 C  Ricotta cheese                           -finely grated
      1 T  Fresh parsley, chopped              2 C  Marinara sauce
      3    Egg whites                               Olive oil
      1 C  Flour, all-purpose             
 
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Cook or thaw spinach and squeeze dry.
  Season with a little salt and pepper; set aside.
  
  Mix ricotta cheese with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley; set
  aside.
  
  MAKE THE CREPE BATTER:  Mix together egg whites, flour and water, then beat
  with a wire whisk to get rid of lumps.
  
  COOK THE CREPES:  Lightly coat a crepe pan with olive oil and heat to
  medium. Ladle 2 1/2 T crepe batter into heated pan. The crepe batter should
  lightly cover the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Tilt pan to cover
  evenly. When edges of crepe turn lacy and brown and crepe is cooked
  through,remove crepe and stack on a plate. Continue until all the batter is
  used.
  
  When the crepes are cooked, assemble the rolls:  spoon 2 rounded T  of
  ricotta cheese mixture and 1 T spinach mixture on each crepe. Fold or roll
  each crepe to seal in mixture.
  
  MAKE AND COOK THE CASSEROLE:  Place rolled crepes in a greased rectangular
  casserole dish.  When the pan is full, spoon marinara sauce over crepes.
  Bake at 325 degrees F. for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve with grated Parmesan
  cheese.
  
  If you don't have a crepe pan, you can use a small (6-inch) frying pan. You
  can make your own marinara sauce, or use a prepared marinara or spaghetti
  sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An Italian vegetable casserole with spinach and cheese -- Mana's spinach
  ricotta roll is a dish my roommate makes.  She got the recipe from her
  Italian mother. I hope you like it as much as I do.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 20 minutes baking.

      Title: PEANUT NOODLES
 Categories: Pasta, Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Chinese-style noodles,              1 T  Nam pla (fermented
           -fresh                                   -fish sauce)
    1/2 T  Garlic chili paste                1/2 C  Water
      2 T  Peanut butter, good                 2    Scallion stalks, chopped
           -(without added sugar)         
 
  Boil a lot of water for the noodles; this is the most time-consuming step.
  
  Rinse and trim scallions, then slice thinly.  In a small mixing bowl,
  combine peanut butter and chili paste with a fork. Mix thoroughly. Add
  water to the peanut mixture. This is tricky, since peanut butter and water
  do not want to mix. Start with a tiny bit of water, mix thoroughly until it
  is homogeneous, and then add some more water. You can begin to add larger
  quantities of water as the sauce gets thinner. The water and peanut butter
  really will mix, if you are patient.
  
  Continue adding water until the sauce has the consistency you want; I make
  it about the consistency of ketchup. Stir in the nam pla.
  
  Once the pot of water is boiling, cook the noodles until they are just
  done, and not mushy. Drain noodles and immediately mix in the sauce. Toss
  until the noodles are evenly coated. Garnish with scallions and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chinese-style noodles with a spicy peanut sauce -- This recipe is not
  authentic Chinese; it was created by combining readily available
  ingredients and double-checking against a Satay recipe. It's close to a
  Satay sauce, but not quite the same thing. It's also similar to a recipe in
  "The Enchanted Broccoli Forest," by Mollie Katzen.
  
  *  The ingredients are readily available at oriental grocery stores.
  Substitute soy sauce if you can't find nam pla.  For fresh noodles, you can
  substitute several packages of ramen noodles, discarding sauce powders.
  
  *  This basic recipe may be varied by modifying quantities.  Vary the chili
  paste to control hotness, and the nam pla to control saltiness (but the
  sauce will taste saltier before mixing with the noodles). If you use this
  as the main dish of a meal, it serves only two. This will keep for at least
  a week in the refrigerator.
  
  *  Serve with a good beer; it's too spicy for most wines.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes, plus waiting for the water to boil.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: MUSHROOM-BACON PARTY PATE
 Categories: Appetizers, Usenet
      Yield: 1 loaf
 
      2 lb Mushrooms (fresh),                  8 oz Cream cheese at
           -chopped very fine                       -room temperature
    1/2 lb Bacon (or more,                   1/2 C  Parsley, chopped
           -to taste)                               -very fine
    2/3 C  Onion, chopped                      2 C  Dry bread crumbs
           -very fine                          1 t  Salt
    2/3 C  Celery, chopped                     1 t  Rosemary, dried
           -very fine                          1 t  Oregano, dried
      4    Eggs                              1/4 t  Black pepper, ground
 
  Fry the bacon and crumble it as fine as possible.  Reserve some of the
  grease.
  
  Chop the mushrooms, onion, celery and parsley as fine as possible.  A food
  processor works best, but you can do it by hand if need be.  Saute the
  onion and celery in the bacon grease until soft, then remove from the
  grease and drain.
  
  Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese slightly, and then beat in the eggs.  Add
  all other ingredients to the eggs/cheese mixture. Mix thoroughly.
  
  Grease a large loaf pan or two small, line with foil, and then grease the
  foil.  Pat the mixture into the loaf pan and cover loosely with foil.  Bake
  for 1 1/2 hours at 400 degrees F.
  
  Let cool completely before serving.  This pate is actually best when
  refrigerated before serving.  Serve with crackers, or with bread cut into
  shapes with cookie cutters.  To make this a more elegant buffet dish,
  garnish the top with a thin layer of aspic.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is heavenly stuff for a buffet, and for those people who love to
  munch, but hate liver pate.  We found it in a magazine some years ago.  The
  magazine has long since been forgotten, but this I know by heart!  Yield: 1
  large loaf.
  
  *  American bacon is called smoked back bacon in many other places.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have a food processor.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: NOODLE PUDDING
 Categories: Puddings, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Egg noodles, cooked                 1 t  Lemon juice
           -(1 package)                        1 T  Butter
      2 C  Sour cream                        1/2 t  Vanilla (or to taste)
      3 oz Cream cheese                        2    Eggs
    1/2 C  Sugar                          
 
  Cook the noodles the full time shown on the package for serving.  Our
  packages here usually give a time for casseroles and a time for serving.
  Drain the noodles, place them in an oven-safe casserole and allow the
  butter to melt on them. Stir to mix the butter.
  
  Beat all the remaining ingredients and add to the cooked noodles.  Bake
  uncovered at 350 degrees F. for one hour.  The top should be golden brown.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A sweet egg noodle kugel -- I usually add more vanilla, but this is the
  original recipe I took from my mother.  If you like a soupier noodle
  pudding, increase the sour cream and cream cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.

      Title: KALAKUKKO
 Categories: Fish, Finnish, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 lb Fish, small                         3 T  Salt (omit salt if
  1 1/2 lb Pork, sliced into                        -pork is already salted)
           -strips like bacon,                      Allspice (optional;
           -but about 1/4 to 1/2                    -traditionalists omit 
           -inch thick                              -this)

-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
  2 1/2 C  Water                               4 t  Salt
  3 1/4 C  Rye flour (sifted)                1/2 oz Yeast (2 standard
  1 3/4 C  Wheat flour, about                       -packages)
           -(sifted)                      
 
  Clean the fish, removing fins, large scales and entrails.  You may leave
  the heads if you dare to eat them.
  
  Mix the flours and salt.  Add the yeast to the water.  When the yeast is
  fully dissolved, make a thick dough by pouring flour mixture into water and
  blending well. The ratio of flour to water depends on the nature of the
  flours. This ratio of 1:2 by volume works well in Finland with Finnish
  flours.  Where flours contain more gluten you should use slightly less
  water.
  
  Set aside about 4 T of dough to be used later.  Roll out the remaining
  dough into a circular shape about 3/4 inch thick.
  
  Assemble the meats into the dough:  cover the inner half of the dough
  circle with half of the pork (the pork should cover a circle whose diameter
  is half the diameter of the rolled dough). Then put all of the fish over
  top of the pork, and add allspice and extra salt if you are using them.
  Finish with the second half of the pork.
  
  Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.  Lift the edges of the dough all around the
  filling and glue together with a little water so that you have the filling
  surrounded from all directions with about 3/4-inch-thick dough.  Put upside
  down (the seam downwards) on a baking sheet and let it rise about half an
  hour at room temperature.
  
  Put the kalakukko in a 500 degree F. oven for long enough to brown the
  dough, which will seal it against moisture. Then lower the temperature to
  about 250 degrees F. and let it bake for 4 to 7 hours depending on the size
  of the fish (bigger fish need more cooking time). You can brush some melted
  butter over the top of the dough just after lowering the temperature; this
  will give it a prettier appearance. If it starts to leak while baking, fill
  holes with the dough which was set aside.
  
  Serve hot or cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rye bread pie with fish and pork filling -- This is an ancient national
  food prepared and eaten in Savo (eastern Finland).
  
  *  Kalakukko was used as travelers' food because it stays edible very long
  when unopened.  Also in medieval times salt was the only way to preserve
  meat and it was expensive, so with this way you could use all the salt in
  salt pork. The word kala-kukko means fish-cock (the bird).
  
  *  You can use any small fish (shorter than about 8 inches).  Small scales
  and spikes don't matter because they soften during the prolonged cooking.
  Make sure you use un-smoked pork.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (some skill with dough is required).
  : Time:  45 minutes preparation, 30 minutes attended baking, 4-7 hours
  unattended baking.
  : Precision:  Careful measurement not necessary, but the consistency of the
  dough (which will depend on the nature of your flours) is important.  If
  the dough is either too soft or too hard, the kalakukko will leak.

      4 C  Water, salted                     1/4 t  Paprika
      3 T  Peanut oil                        1/4 t  Ground cloves
      1    Garlic clove, mashed                1 T  Almonds, slivered
 
  Clean and trim green beans.  Simmer in lightly salted water until just
  tender, about 30-45 minutes. Drain and put in serving dish.
  
  Put remaining ingredients (except almonds) in a saucepan over medium heat
  and cook for two minutes, stirring constantly. Add the almonds and stir
  briefly to coat. Pour the oil mixture over the green beans and toss gently
  until beans are thoroughly coated. Serve warm.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Algerian green beans with almonds -- This is a variation on an Algerian
  recipe from Rose Dosti's "Middle Eastern Cooking."  Since when is North
  Africa in the Middle East? You may well ask.
  
  *  Canned green beans are not an acceptable substitute in this recipe.
  Powdered garlic is probably OK.

      Title: KEY LIME PIE
 Categories: Pies, Southern, Usenet
      Yield: 1 pie
 
      3    Eggs                                     Sugar
     14 oz Condensed milk (one                 1    Graham cracker pie
           -standard can)                           -crust
      4 oz Key Lime juice                 
 
  Separate the eggs.  You'll be whipping the whites, so put them in a large
  enough bowl.  Combine the egg yolks, the condensed milk and the juice, and
  stir until thoroughly combined.  The acidity of the juice thickens the milk
  and eggs into a custard.
  
  Add a pinch of sugar to the egg whites, and beat them until stiff but not
  dry.
  
  Spoon the custard into the pie crust and even it out.  Spoon the beaten egg
  whites on top of the custard and even it out so it looks pretty.
  
  Chill before serving.  If you like, run the pie under a hot broiler for a
  minute until the egg whites are slightly browned.  (This is primarily for
  appearance, it doesn't affect the flavor much.)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional lime pie dessert from the Florida Keys -- This very easy
  custard pie originated in the Florida Keys in the 1800's when fresh
  ingredients other than the local limes were hard to come by.  See the notes
  for information on some of the ingredients.  Yield:  One 8-inch pie.
  
  *  Everybody in the Florida Keys seems to have a variant of this recipe. It
  shows up on postcards, place mats, lime juice bottles and guide books. Some
  people fold a little of the beaten egg white into the custard to make it
  lighter.  Some put sweetened whipped cream on top rather than egg white.
  Some use two or four eggs.
  
  *  Traditionally, this pie is made from the juice of the Key lime, a small
  yellow citrus fruit quite different from the larger and more familiar
  Persian lime. Key limes are very sensitive to cold and in the U.S. have
  never been grown above the very southern tip of Florida. Bad weather and
  disease have killed off so many of them that the only remaining grove is a
  private one on one of the Keys, so you cannot buy Key lime juice in the
  U.S.  any more. Key limes are still grown widely in South America and
  probably elsewhere on other continents.
  
  There is something called Key West lime juice sold in pint bottles which
  everybody uses instead now, which seems to be regular lime juice slightly
  concentrated.  It's widely available in Florida and occasionally elsewhere
  in the U.S. It's also available via mail order from Key West Aloe,
  telephone +1 305 294 5592 or 800-327-5866. In a pinch, you can substitute
  regular lime juice, though it doesn't produce quite the bright yellow
  custard that traditionalists like. You may have to use extra juice, because
  Persian limes are less acidic than Key limes.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1-2 hours chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  Dump everything together and mix until well-combined.  Pack into small jars
  and label (the now-empty spice jars that held the ingredients are a good
  size).  Store in a cool dry place.  Crumble spices in hand when using.
  Measure spices by volume, not by weight, because of the large variation in
  moisture content.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A French-style mixture of herbs and seeds -- I found this in some
  magazine many many years ago. I usually make it every year or so and give
  it  to people as presents. The recipients are continually asking either for
  the recipe or refills. This goes well in soups and similar things but is
  especially good in scrambled eggs.

      6    Eggs, hard-boiled             

----------------------------------COVERING----------------------------------
      1 lb Sausage meat                        1 T  Mustard
    1/2 C  Rolled oats                       1/4 t  Black pepper

----------------------------------COATING----------------------------------
      1 C  Bread crumbs                        2    Eggs, beaten

  *  Hard-boiled eggs in a sausage/oatmeal crust -- Scotch eggs are great as
  appetizers, lunches or dinner!  I took this recipe from my Mom's
  collection, but I'm not sure where she got it.
  
  *  Scotch eggs are delicious either hot or cold.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation after eggs are hard-boiled.

      Title: MAMA STAMBERG'S CRANBERRY RELISH
 Categories: Condiments, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 C  Cranberries, raw                  3/4 C  Sour cream
      1 sm Onion                               2 T  White horseradish
    1/2 C  Sugar                                    -(prepared)
 
  Grind the onion and cranberries together.  Add all the other ingredients
  and mix well. Put in a plastic container and freeze. One hour before
  serving, move to the refrigerator to soften.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Frozen cranberry relish with horseradish -- Susan Stamberg, former
  co-host of National Public Radio's "All Things Considered," used to
  broadcast this recipe every year around Thanksgiving. She claimed it was
  her mother's, but it turned out that her mother got it from a Craig
  Claiborne column many years before. Very few people are neutral about this
  unusual, rather strong relish, they either love it or hate it. I'm in the
  former group.
  
  *  This relish is shocking pink in color, so plan your table setting
  accordingly.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight freezing.
  : Precision:  measure the horseradish.

      Title: DOUBLE CHOCOLATE CHESS PIE
 Categories: Pies, Usenet
      Yield: 1 pie
 
    1/2 C  Butter                          1 1/2 t  Vanilla extract
      2 oz Chocolate, unsweetened            1/8 t  Salt
      1 C  Sugar                               1    Pie shell, baked
      3    Eggs, lightly beaten                     Vanilla ice cream or
    1/4 C  Creme de cacao liqueur                   -sweetened whipped cream
      2 T  Flour (all-purpose)                      -(optional)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt
  butter and chocolate.  Remove from heat.  Blend in sugar, eggs, liqueur,
  flour, vanilla and salt.  Beat until smooth.  Pour into the pie shell. Bake
  for 30 to 35 minutes or until set.  Cool on a wire rack for at least 30
  minutes.  Serve with ice cream or whipped cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich chocolate pie -- I got this recipe from a 1983 calendar.  It's
  tried and true and delicious. It's also very simple to make. I usually
  double the recipe, since one pie never seems to last long enough. Maybe
  that makes it a double double chocolate pie. I've made it using chocolate
  almond liqueur instead of creme de cacao. It came out OK, and had a hint of
  a nutty flavor in the background.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: THE COUNTESS'S MUSHROOMS
 Categories: Entrees, Pasta, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Mushrooms, fresh                    2 t  Onion powder
      4 T  Butter                            1/2 t  Nutmeg
      2 T  Flour                             1/2 t  Tarragon
      2 t  Broth                             1/4 t  Curry powder
  1 1/2 C  Sour cream                        1/2 t  Black pepper,
      2 T  Lemon juice                              -freshly ground
      1 t  Garlic powder                     1/4 t  Salt (or to taste)
 
  In a large frying pan, melt the butter.  Saute mushrooms in butter until
  tender (about 5 minutes).  Mix flour and chicken base together.  Sprinkle
  over mushrooms. Cook one more minute, stirring. Add sour cream, lemon juice
  and all seasonings. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more, stirring.
  
  We use chicken broth or chicken bouillon.  If you use a vegetable broth
  this is a vegetarian dish.
  
  If you can resist digging in right away, cook this ahead of time to give
  the flavors a chance to mellow. At serving time, rewarm carefully over low
  heat. This is wonderful as a main dish served over rice, noodles or
  fettucini Alfredo.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich treat for mushroom lovers -- This recipe originated in "Ken Kelly
  Cooks," and is presented with only minor additions and changes.  Yield:
  serves 2 gluttons.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

      Title: BLUEBERRY MUFFINS
 Categories: Muffins, Usenet
      Yield: 12 muffins
 
  1 3/4 C  Flour                             3/4 C  Milk
      6 T  Sugar                             1/3 C  Cooking oil
  2 1/2 t  Baking powder                     3/4 C  Blueberries
    3/4 t  Salt                                1 t  Lemon peel
      1    Egg, beaten                    
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Stir together the flour, sugar, baking
  powder and salt. Make a well in the center.
  
  In a separate bowl, combine the egg, milk and oil.  Add egg mixture, all at
  once, to the flour mixture.  Stir JUST until moistened.  Yes, the batter
  should be lumpy.  (If you try to stir all the lumps out, your muffins will
  be very tough.) CAREFULLY fold in blueberries and optional lemon peel.
  
  Grease muffin cups, or line with paper bake cups; fill each 2/3 full. Bake
  at 400 degrees F. for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from
  pans; serve warm with butter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Award-winning blueberry muffins -- these muffins won a blue ribbon
  during the years that I was eligible for the Dade County (Miami, Florida)
  Youth Fair. I think this particular recipe came originally from the "Better
  Homes and Gardens Cookbook," but I could be wrong.
  
  *  The less you stir once you've combined the two mixtures, the better your
  muffins will be.  (To a point, but over-mixing is much more common than
  under- mixing.) Frozen blueberries work fine, if you can't get hold of
  fresh berries. I'm sure other kinds of fruit will work fine, too, but I
  haven't tried them.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (proper mixing technique required).
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 25 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: FRIED MOZZARELLA CHEESE
 Categories: Appetizers, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Mozzarella cheese                 1/2 t  Cumin, ground
    1/2 C  Flour                               1 pn Salt and pepper
      3 lg Eggs                                8 oz Marinara sauce,
      1 C  Bread crumbs                             -chilled
    1/2 t  Garlic powder                            Vegetable oil
    1/2 t  Oregano                        
 
  Cut the mozzarella into sticks a bit more than about 1/4 inch thick and
  about 1 1/2 inches long. Coat the sticks with flour, shaking off excess.
  Combine the bread crumbs and seasonings in a flat dish. Beat the eggs and
  place in a separate bowl.
  
  Coat the sticks by dipping them in the egg and then in the bread crumbs.
  The coating on the first stick should be fairly dry when you finish the
  last stick. Repeat with another dip in the egg and then in the bread
  crumbs.
  
  Deep-fry the coated sticks in oil for about 3 to 4 minutes until the
  coating is cooked. Fry in batches, keeping the finished ones warm in the
  oven. Serve with chilled marinara sauce or salsa.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fried mozzarella sticks with marinara -- Use your imagination when
  choosing spices. The spices listed here are just a suggestion.
  
  *  Be careful when frying, as some sticks split open when they are done,
  leaving lots of cheese in your frying oil.  You may need more egg or bread
  crumbs, depending on how many sticks you have and how thick you coat them.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (frying skill required).
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 md Kabocha squash (also                6 C  Broth (vegetable or
           -known as Japanese                       -chicken), or use water
           -pumpkin)                           2 t  Nutmeg (or less)
      1 C  Millet, dry                       1/8 t  Cayenne pepper
 
  Bring the broth to a boil in a large stock pot, add millet and simmer for
  about 30 min, until millet is well-cooked.  Add squash, mix and simmer for
  another 15-20 min, until squash is tender.
  
  Puree the mixture in batches in a blender or food processor until it is
  reduced to a creamy texture.  Add the nutmeg and pepper and reheat.  Serve
  with a scoop of yogurt in each bowl.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A hearty soup with millet and Japanese pumpkin -- A delicious
  combination, this hearty soup makes a good side dish, and is great reheated
  for breakfast.
  
  *  Butternut squash makes a good substitute for kabocha if you cannot find
  it at your local market.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  60 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK; be careful with spices.

    1/2 lb Chana dall (split                   1    Parsley sprig
           -yellow peas)                       1 t  Turmeric
      3 sm Onions (button-sized)               1 t  Thyme
      6    Onion springs                       1 t  Salt
      4    Watercress sprigs                 1/4 t  Black pepper,
      2    Green chilies                            -freshly ground
 
  Soak the dall in cold water for a day, then drain thoroughly.
  
  Chop all the vegetable ingredients finely.  Place the dall in a food
  processor and process to a paste. Decant into a bowl, add turmeric, salt
  and pepper, and vegetable ingredients and mix well.
  
  Heat oil in a deep-frying pan.  When it is hot, roll walnut-sized pieces of
  the paste in the palm of the hand and drop in to the oil to fry until
  golden brown. Remove from the oil and drain the gateaux on kitchen towels.
  Serve hot, with drinks.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Savoury spice balls -- This recipe is from the kitchen of Fred Hopper,
  and is originally from the isle of Mauritius. Fred often serves these as
  delicious late-night snacks, to accompany drinks.
  
  *  The choice of drinks served will depend on how spicy you make the
  gateaux: cool beer or lager usually goes down well.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate
  : Time:  1 day soaking dall.  30 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Weighing of ingredients is best, but measures can be
  approximate.

    1/2 t  Mace                              1/4 C  Rum or brandy
    1/2 t  Nutmeg                        

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
      4 T  Butter                            1/2 C  Sugar
    1/2 C  Rum or brandy                  
 
  Mix the melted butter, eggs, rum and coffee together.  Add brown sugar and
  mix well. Add rest of dry ingredients and place in a buttered loaf pan.
  
  Bake at 300 degrees F. for 2 hours or until done (it will separate from the
  sides of the pan).  Make glaze when almost completely baked:  Melt (do not
  boil) butter.  Add rum and sugar.  Stir by hand.  Remove the cake from the
  oven and pour half of the glaze over it.  Let it cool 25 minutes, then turn
  it over and pour the remaining glaze on the other side.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A traditional European-style fruit cake -- Although fruitcakes have a
  bad reputation, this one is *excellent*. My mother has been making it for
  years. She originally got the recipe from a friend, but has since adapted
  it to suit her fans. (She gets requests for it all year long.)
  
  *  Don't use glass pans.  This freezes well, if you make more than you can
  eat; just be sure to wrap it carefully so it doesn't get freezer burn. Warm
  frozen cake in the oven, not the microwave.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours baking, 30 minutes finishing.

      2 t  Curry powder (more or             1/2 t  Salt
           -less, to taste)                         Pepper, freshly ground,
      2 T  Flour                                    -to taste
 
  Rub the bottom and sides of the fondue pot with the clove of garlic before
  crushing it and using it in the next step.
  
  Bring the garlic, onion, wine and curry powder to simmering point in the
  fondue pot.  If you want to speed things along a little then you can do
  this on the stove and then transfer the mixture to the fondue pot.
  
  Combine the grated cheese and flour by tossing in a plastic bag.  Gradually
  stir in the cheese, a handful at a time.  Allow it to melt completely
  between each addition. When all the cheese has been added the mixture
  should be bubbling and smooth.
  
  Stir in the relish.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Keep the
  mixture warm over a burner, seat your guests down, fill their wine glasses
  and enjoy your meal.
  
  I often add more cheese than the recipe calls for.  You can use any of the
  following as dippers with the fondue:
  
  :  o  Mushroom caps, sauteed quickly in butter, tossed in chopped parsley
  :  o  Whole, peeled and deveined prawns
  :  o  Fresh pineapple chunks
  :  o  Canned artichoke hearts, well drained and halved
  :  o  Unpeeled apple wedges, thick banana slices or peeled pear quarters
  :  o  Thick cucumber slices or chunks
  :  o  Small whole radishes
  :  o  Cauliflower
  :  o  A small French loaf per person
  :  o  Anything else that tickles your fancy
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cheese fondue with curry flavor -- This is a very tasty meal and a lot
  of fun as well. You will need to have a crockery fondue pot and a burner,
  as all the cooking happens on your dinner table with your guests doing all
  their own cooking! My wife and I enjoy a fondue with dinner guests or
  simply by ourselves, and this is one of our favourites. This recipe is
  adopted from one published by the Australian Dairy Corporation many years
  ago.
  
  *  Toss fruit in lemon juice to prevent browning.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  40 minutes preparation, cooking takes as long as it takes you to
  eat it.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK

      Title: SWEET CUCUMBER CHUNKS
 Categories: Pickles, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
     10    Cucumbers, not too fat              5 t  Salt (non-iodized salt
      8 C  Sugar                                    -is best)
      2 T  Pickling spice                      4 C  Vinegar
           -(see note)                    
 
  Wash cucumbers and place in large pot.  Pour boiling water over cucumbers
  until they are covered.  Let stand for 24 hours and then drain.  Repeat
  this procedure for three (3) days. The cucumbers will be rather slimy after
  this. This is normal.
  
  On the fourth day drain and slice into bite-size chunks.  If the cucumbers
  are fat you can halve or quarter the chunks so you end up with bite-size
  pieces.
  
  Combine the remaining ingredients.  Bring mixture to a boil, stirring
  frequently.  Pour cooked mixture over the cucumber pieces.  Return to a
  boil, but just a boil. Do not cook. Pour cucumbers and liquid mixture into
  canning jars and seal. Jars should be sealed in a boiling water bath for 10
  minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A very sweet cucumber pickle -- My wife's grandmother provided us with
  this wonderful pickle recipe. Yield: Serves many.
  
  *  These are best if they sit for a month or so after canning, to give them
  time to work.  If you use iodized salt, they are more likely to get cloudy
  during that month.
  
  *  If your grocery does not sell pre-mixed pickling spice mixtures, try
  various combinations of mustard seeds, celery seeds, coriander, dill, or
  any other strongly-flavored spices that you like.
  
  *  We increase this recipe by several times.  Last year we used about 200
  cucumbers.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  4 days of soaking.  About 1-2 hours of real work.
  : Precision:  Approximate measure ok.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Moist cookies with cranberries, apples and cinnamon -- Many years ago
  one of my brothers complained to me that he didn't like cookies much, that
  they were always too dry and pasty. I came up with this recipe for him. He
  still doesn't like cookies, but the recipe has made its way to various
  other people to become a favorite.
  
  *  Don't store these in a cookie jar, they will get too mushy.

      Title: CORN AND SAUSAGE CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Polish sausage,                     4 C  Corn
           -sliced thinly                      2 C  Potatoes, cubed
      6 sl Bacon, chopped                           -(about 1/4")
      1 C  Onions, chopped                   1/8 t  White pepper
    1/4 C  Flour                                    Red pepper sauce
      2 C  Chicken stock                       2 C  Milk
      1 C  Water                               2 T  Butter
 
  In a big saucepan, brown the sausage and bacon until bacon is crispy.
  Remove sausage and bacon with a slotted spoon, and drain on a paper towel.
  Discard most of the fat; leave enough to cook the onion. Saute onion in
  reserved fat until tender, about 5 minutes.
  
  Gradually stir in the flour.  Add stock and water, stirring constantly. Add
  sausage, bacon, corn, potatoes and white pepper.  Add red pepper sauce to
  taste.  Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 15 to 20
  minutes.  Stir occasionally.
  
  Add milk and cook until soup is heated through and potatoes are tender. Top
  with butter and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich creamy chowder with corn and sausages -- This chowder is a
  variation on a family recipe from an old roommate of mine. (She makes it
  without the sausage, and with more water). It goes very well with most
  seafood.  I am especially fond of it served with crab cakes. Yield: Serves
  6-8.

      Title: CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING
 Categories: Puddings, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 oz Chocolate (semisweet            1 1/2 C  Milk
           -or white), melted                  2    Eggs, lightly beaten
    1/2 C  Sugar, granulated               2 1/2 C  Bread cubes (small,
    1/4 t  Salt                                     -firm and fresh)
      1 t  Cinnamon, ground               
 
  Butter four 1-cup ramekins or six custard cups and place them on a cookie
  sheet.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
  
  Combine the melted chocolate, sugar, salt and cinnamon.  Stir the milk in
  slowly and then add the eggs.  Beat the entire mixture with a whisk until
  well blended. Stir in the bread cubes and let them soak for a few minutes.
  Beat the pudding with a whisk again. The bread cubes should fall apart
  somewhat.
  
  Divide the pudding between the ramekins or custard cups and put them,
  cookie sheet and all, into the oven. Bake for 15 minutes or until the edges
  look done (spongey, like a cake) and the middle is just under done.
  
  Cool for 15 minutes and serve or cool completely, wrap, and store in the
  refrigerator.  They will keep for 3 to 4 days, at least, if refrigerated.
  The puddings can be warmed in a microwave oven at medium power.
  
  The original recipe has half as much cinnamon and eggs.  I added the extra
  egg to make the pudding slightly custardy.
  
  If you can get them, Guittard's Vanilla Milk Chips do quite well in this
  recipe in place of the chocolate.
  
  If you use a crusty bread, trim crusts from bread before using.  I usually
  use Pepperidge Farm's white bread and I don't trim. I think the average
  American white bread is not firm enough. I have used a purchased whole
  wheat granola bread with quite good results. I think this recipe could
  easily be altered to include nuts, chopped dates, chopped dried apples
  and/or raisins.
  
  For a richer pudding, try using leftover cake instead of bread.  Once I
  even baked a small cake from a mix and chopped that up for this recipe. One
  layer makes a double batch. (It was a Dutch chocolate cake, how decadent!)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate bread pudding with cinnamon -- This recipe originally came
  from "Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate" by Barbara Myers. I have modified it
  somewhat.  Yield:  4-6 servings.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation and 15 minutes cooking.

      Title: CHICK-PEA SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Chick peas                        3/4 C  Olive oil
      2 T  Baking soda                         2 t  Salt
      4 sm Onions (or fewer),                       Lemon juice
           -chopped                       
 
  Soak the chick peas in water overnight.  Drain the chick peas and sprinkle
  the baking soda on them. Stir them a little and let them stand for one
  hour.
  
  Rinse the chick peas with plenty of water.  Put them in a pot and cover
  them with water. Bring them to a boil, then lower heat to medium. Skim off
  the scum that forms on the surface, and then add the onions. Cover and cook
  on low heat for about two hours or until the chick peas are soft. (If
  necessary, add some hot water into the pot while the chick peas are
  cooking).
  
  Add the olive oil and salt, and cook for a few more minutes.  Serve with a
  dash of lemon juice, plenty of fresh bread and, if you like, a chunk of
  feta cheese on the side.
  
  You're supposed to remove the skin off the chick peas.  I was never able to
  do it (it comes off only with some difficulty, and you have to do it for
  each individual pea), but it doesn't seem to affect the dish adversely.
  
  You know that the soup is done when the chick peas begin to dissolve,
  making the soup rather thick. This might not give the dish a very
  attractive appearance, but the taste is an entirely different matter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Greek style chick-pea soup -- I got this recipe from a Greek cookbook.
  It is the standard way of cooking chick peas in Greece.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  overnight soak, 2-3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHICKEN TARRAGON
 Categories: Poultry, Herbs, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Chicken breasts                     1 C  Cream, heavy
      3 T  Butter                              1 t  Tarragon
      1 C  Vermouth, dry                       1 pn Salt and pepper
      2 t  Mustard, dijon                 
 
  Remove the skin and bone from the chicken breasts.  Pound with a meat
  mallet until chicken breast is of even thickness.
  
  Melt the butter in a skillet.  Saute chicken 4 minutes on each side. Remove
  the chicken to a warm dish while you prepare the sauce.
  
  Mix the dijon mustard into the vermouth and pour the mixture into the
  skillet. Stir to dissolve the browned bits in the pan. Reduce volume of
  liquid by half over medium heat. Add the heavy cream and the tarragon. Stir
  continuously, 5 to 10 minutes, until mixture thickens.
  
  Arrange the chicken on a serving dish and pour some of the cream sauce over
  it.  Serve the remaining sauce on the side.
  
  For a different flavor, saute about 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms before de-
  glazing the skillet with the vermouth.
  
  If you are daring, you can cook the chicken breasts at the same time you
  are making the sauce, using one hand for each. This will make the chicken
  be warmer when served.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sauted chicken with a tarragon cream sauce -- This recipe comes from the
  little cookbook "Anodyne Delights," a collection of recipes by Barbara Tyne
  who, along with her husband Tom, operated the chartered yacht Anodyne in
  the Caribbean. Barbara served this dish with rice and broccoli tossed with
  butter, garlic and Parmesan cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you buy boneless chicken breasts.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE ROUGE ET VERT
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Chicken breast,                          -whole

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
           Juice of 1 lime                     1    Garlic clove,
    1/2 C  White wine                               -finely chopped
      1 t  Ginger                              1 pn Tarragon


-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
           Juice of 1 lime                          Butter (salted)
      3 oz White wine                          3 oz Tomato paste
 
  Mix the marinade ingredients.  Bone the chicken breast, obtaining 2
  supremes, and marinate for at least 30 minutes. Reserve bones.
  
  Cook a bouillon using the bones.  You will need about 3 oz of bouillon.
  
  Drain, flatten and flour the supremes.  Saute quickly in clarified butter,
  about two minutes on each side.  Remove and keep warm.
  
  Raise the heat to high, add wine, lime juice, tomato paste and bouillon.
  Cook down until it looks like it's been cooked too much. Remove from heat
  and swirl in a goodly chunk of butter. If you remove the sauce too soon, it
  will be too soupy. The sauce should be cinnamon-coloured and shiny. There
  will be very little sauce, you may need a rubber scraper to get it out of
  the pan.
  
  Serve with rice or some other bland vegetable.
  
  Experiment with the sauce, varying the ratio of ingredients.  I have just
  strained the chunky bits from the marinade and used that.  Wear a raincoat
  when making the sauce.  It splatters.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken breasts in tomato-lime sauce -- This recipe was originally
  posted to net.cooks in May of '82 by Martin Minow @ decvax. The French name
  means "boneless chicken breasts in red and green sauce." I like it a lot.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (judgment required).
  : Time:  30 minutes marinating, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8    Chicken breast                      4 t  Curry powder
           -halves (boned)                     3 t  Olive oil
      6 C  Grapes, seedless                    1 t  Cayenne pepper
           -(or less; vary amount            1/2 t  Black pepper, ground
           -to taste)                          1 t  Fruit vinegar
      2 C  Mayonnaise                     
 
  Make the sauce by mixing together all ingredients except the chicken and
  the grapes. Season to taste (sample by dipping a grape into the sauce and
  then eating it).
  
  Broil the chicken breasts (3-5 minutes on each side in a preheated
  broiler), then dice or shred into small bite-sized pieces.
  
  Mix chopped chicken with about 2 cups of whole grapes.  Cover with the
  sauce. Add more grapes to taste. My taste is to add vast quantities of
  grapes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken fruit salad curry -- One day I was invited to a beach picnic,
  and asked to bring a salad. A friend and I got together in his kitchen and
  concocted a curried chicken salad with grapes.  It was delicious, but we
  forgot to write down the recipe.  After some more experimentation, I have
  come up with this recipe. I don't know if it is the same as what we made
  that day at the beach, but it is delicious.

  2 1/2 C  Flour, all-purpose                       Raspberry jam
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and sugar.  Add
  the flour and egg yolk and mix well. Add the cream cheese and mix well.
  
  Roll into balls about 5/8 inch diameter.  Place them on an ungreased cookie
  sheet (the cookies don't grow when baked, so they can be somewhat close
  together).  Then press your thumb into each to flatten it and make an
  indentation to hold some jam.  Fill it with jam.  Bake at 350 degrees F for
  15 to 20 minutes.
  
  You can use any flavor jam you like.  The jam is the only part of the
  cookie that has any texture, so I prefer using it to jelly.
  
  Don't eat the cookies straight from the oven, or you'll probably burn your
  tongue.  The jam stays hotter much longer than the cookie.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple filled butter cookies with cream cheese.  Yield:  3-4 dozen.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, but strenuous if made by hand.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 15-20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

 Categories: Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Cauliflower                       1/2 t  Tumeric
      2    Onions                            1/2 t  Cumin
      6 T  Oil (or less)                       2 T  Parsley, chopped
    1/2 t  Mustard seeds                       2 lg Tomatoes
      1 t  Ginger, ground                           Sugar

  she got it from a magazine somewhere.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: BISCUITS SUPREME
 Categories: Biscuits, Usenet
      Yield: 12 scones
 
      2 C  Flour                             1/2 t  Salt
      4 t  Baking powder                     1/2 C  Shortening
      2 t  Sugar                             2/3 C  Milk
    1/2 t  Cream of tartar                
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Stir together the flour, baking powder,
  sugar, cream of tartar and salt. Cut in the shortening until the mixture
  resembles coarse crumbs.
  
  Make a well in the center.  Pour in the milk all at once.  Stir just until
  dough clings together; NO MORE.
  
  Knead gently on a lightly floured surface for 10-12 strokes.  Roll or pat
  to about 1/2-inch thickness. Cut with a (about) 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter,
  dipping the cutter into flour before each cut.
  
  Transfer to an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake in a 450 degrees F oven for
  10-12 minutes, or until golden.
  
  Lots of cookbooks tell you to use two knives, or some such, to do the
  cutting-in of the first step.  Forks work fine for me (I'm a klutz.)
  
  All of the trick to making light, fluffy biscuits is in how you handle
  them: THE LESS, THE BETTER. You can make these as drop biscuits (skip the
  rolling; drop batter by tablespoons, and bake); they're even better for the
  lack of handling.
  
  Outside North America you might not know what shortening is.  Use butter,
  margarine, copha or lard.  Vegetable shortening really is better for this
  recipe, but don't forget lots of butter to put *on* them....  I make these
  for study breaks. They disappear at an exponential rate....
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple, fluffy biscuits -- This originated in "The Better Homes and
  Gardens Cookbook," which I consider basic equipment for genteel
  middle-class living. Here "biscuits" is the North American meaning of the
  word and not the Commonwealth meaning of the word. In England these would
  be called "scones." Yield: makes 10-12.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      6 C  Black-eyed peas,               
 
  In a large, heavy casserole, saute salt pork over low heat until the fat
  has been rendered. Do not let it brown. Add peppers, tomatoes, onion and
  garlic to salt pork and cook 5 minutes more over low heat.
  
  Add rice and stir for a minute.  Add remaining ingredients except for
  scallions and parsley.  Cook, covered, for 20 minutes, or until rice is
  tender and most of liquid is absorbed.
  
  Add scallions and parsley; gently mix together.  Serve hot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spicy Caribbean Black-Eyed Peas and Rice -- I got this originally from
  my local newspaper.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy but tedious (a lot of chopping).
  : Time:  30 minutes after the black-eyed peas are cooked.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

      Title: SNOWBALL COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 4 dozen
 
      2 C  Flour, all-purpose                  1    Egg
    1/2 t  Salt                                1 t  Vanilla extract
    3/4 C  Butter (or margarine),              1 C  Walnuts, chopped
           -softened                                Confectioner's sugar
    1/2 C  Sugar                          
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease cookie sheets lightly with unsalted
  shortening.
  
  Sift together flour and salt.  Work butter in a bowl until creamy.  Add
  sugar and beat until well blended. Add egg and vanilla and beat well.
  
  Gradually add sifted dry ingredients, beating well after each addition.
  Stir in walnuts. Shape dough into small balls about 3/4 inch in diameter.

  Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl.  Let it sit for several
  hours, stirring occasionally.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indonesian relish with lime, chili and basil -- This recipe comes from
  the "Time/Life Pacific and Southeast Asian Cooking." I've been unable to
  find a recipe even remotely resembling it in any other Indonesian cookbook.
  I like to cross-reference recipes and learn where they came from, but only
  the Time/Life reporters seem to have found this one. In any event, it's
  quite wonderful. Not for the faint of heart.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 2 hours sitting.
  : Precision:  no need to measure, but count the chili peppers.

      Title: PORK LOIN BRAISED IN MILK
 Categories: Meats, Italian, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Pork loin roast                          Black pepper,
           -(between 2-5 lb; you                    -freshly ground
           -can also use a pork                     Milk to cover roast;
           -shoulder roast)                         -see instructions
      2 T  Butter                              2 T  Water, warm
      2 T  Olive oil                                -(more as needed)
           Salt                           
 
  Find a saucepan that fits the pork roast closely, but still allows you to
  turn the roast in it.  Add the butter and oil to the pan.  Heat at
  medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides.
  
  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add enough milk to cover 3/4 of the meat.
  Cover the saucepan, but leave the lid ajar.  Turn the heat down to medium
  and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, until the sauce has reduced to thick,
  nut-brown clusters. If the sauce has not reduced after 2 1/2 hours, remove
  the meat, keep it warm, and increase the heat to high until the sauce
  thickens.
  
  Remove the roast from the sauce, if you haven't already.  Turn the heat
  down and skim the fat from the sauce. Add the water, turn the heat to high,
  and scrape the bottom of the saucepan (there will be a crust on the bottom
  that you'll want to get loose).
  
  Return the meat to the pan, warm it up, and serve it with the sauce.
  
  The cleanup for this recipe takes a while, because the saucepan gets a
  crust on the bottom.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Italian-style pork roast in milk -- I got this recipe from a friend, who
  got it from a cookbook in Italy.  It is very rich and flavorful.  I have
  not seen this method of preparation in any other recipe. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 2-3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: SOUTHERN STYLE PORK CHOPS
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Pork chops,                       3/4 C  Mushroom soup, condensed
           -about 1/2 inch                          -(or make a mushroom-
           Shortening or oil                        -flavored white sauce)
      4    Onion slices (we                    1 t  Worcestershire sauce
           -like these fairly thick)           1 t  Salt
    1/4 C  Peanut butter                     1/8 t  Black pepper
    1/4 C  Milk       
 
  In a frying pan big enough to hold all of the chops at once,  brown pork
  chops on both sides in a little shortening or oil. Pour off fat, leaving
  chops in frying pan. Place an onion slice on top of each chop.
  
  Mix peanut butter, mushroom soup, milk, Worcestershire sauce, salt and
  pepper. Pour over chops. Cover and simmer over medium to low heat for 45
  minutes. You may want to move the chops around in the pan from time to time
  to keep them from sticking.
  
  Smooth peanut butter is best.  The chunky variety gives a strange
  consistency to this dish.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pork chops in mushroom peanut-butter sauce -- I originally found this
  recipe in the "Woman's Day Encyclopedia of Cookery."  It is very easy to
  prepare and makes a hearty main dish served over rice or noodles.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes browning, 45 minutes simmering.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: PECAN TARTS
 Categories: Pies, Desserts, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 4 dozen
 
-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
      6 oz Cream cheese                        2 C  Flour, all-purpose
    1/2 lb Butter (or margarine)         

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      3 C  Brown sugar                         4    Eggs, beaten
      2 t  Vanilla                             4 T  Butter (or margarine),
      1 C  Pecans, chopped                          -melted
 
  Allow the butter and cream cheese to soften.  Mix cream cheese and butter
  with a mixer until fluffy. Then (using your hands) mix in the flour.
  Separate mixture into four equal parts and flatten each into a rectangular
  shape. Allow the pastry to chill for several hours.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Prepare filling by mixing all ingredients
  gently.  Use a spoon, not a mixer.  Refrigerate until muffin tins are ready
  to fill.
  
  Take one unit of the chilled pastry and cut into 12 equal pieces.  Roll
  each piece into a ball and then form the ball into the muffin tin in the
  shape of a crust. Fill each tart about 3/4 full. Bake at 350 degrees F. for
  20 to 30 minutes.
  
  Bake these until slightly brown.  To remove tarts, just turn the tin upside
  down onto paper towels and then turn the tart right side up on a baking
  rack to cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Miniature pecan pies cooked in bite-size individual crusts in tiny
  muffin tins -- They are quite delicious.
  
  *  You will need to purchase tiny muffin tins, sometimes called "nugget
  pans," to make these tarts. They are inexpensive and you can use these for
  various other things. It is best to purchase enough to make four dozen at
  once. The entire four dozen will fit into the oven on one rack! It is best
  to spray these tins with cooking oil before putting the crust in.
  
  *  There is a wooden utensil called a "tart-tamper" that is a real
  time-saver for this recipe. It might be difficult to find. It is used to
  smash the ball to fit the tin so you don't spend a lot of time using your
  fingers.  You dip the tip of the tamper in flour each time to prevent
  sticking to the pastry. It also makes the pastry look much more uniform and
  professional.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have a tart tamper; moderate otherwise.
  : Time:  15 minutes pastry preparation; several hours chilling; 1 hour
  filling, baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  Be precise for the pastry, filling may be approximate.

  cookie recipe.  I don't remember where I got this particular version of the
  recipe but I remember my great-aunt making these cookies for us as kids.
  
  *  My great-aunt never put nuts in these cookies.  I like nuts but I find
  that they get lost in the recipe. If you want the oats to be less
  prominent, use quick-cooking oats. They will fall apart somewhat in the
  final mixing.
  
  *  A heavy sauce pan makes burning the fudge less likely but stir, stir,
  stir, anyway.
  
  *  The cooking time at boil is important.  Cooked too little the cookies
  will not set; too much and they start to harden before you get them out of
  the pan.
  
  *  These cookies are better the next day, if there are any left.

      Title: MUSTARD GREENS
 Categories: Vegetables, Southern, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Mustard greens                    1/2 t  Pepper
    1/2 lb Bacon                               2 T  Vinegar
      1    Yellow onion                   
 
  Wash the greens carefully about 5 times (like spinach, they can hide an
  incredible amount of grit) by  soaking, then swishing in the water, then
  shaking out above the water and checking for dirt in the water.  Repeat
  until there has been no grit twice. Now, a hand-sized clump at a time,
  slice into thin strips (about 1/2 inches wide is fine).
  
  Cook the bacon in a deep dish to render the fat.  Remove the bacon and
  saute the onion slices until they are just beginning to turn brown. Add the
  sliced greens and stir over medium heat until they wilt, then add the
  reserved bacon and cover the dish. When cooked, add pepper and vinegar,
  then serve.
  
  How long you allow mustard greens to cook is a matter of taste.
  Traditionally, they are cooked to death (in excess of an hour).  I prefer
  them cooked for about 10-15 minutes after wilting. It is not usually
  necessary to add water, but do not allow them to dry out. There should be
  some "pot liquor" in the bottom when you're done, which people normally
  fight over.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cooked mustard greens with bacon and onion -- Lucky you!  Down home
  mustard greens!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

      Title: PAPRIKA MUSHROOM SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     12 oz Mushrooms, cleaned                  1 T  Hungarian paprika
           -and sliced                         1 T  Tamari
      2 C  Onion, chopped                           Black pepper, to taste
      1    Garlic clove, crushed                    Salt, to taste
      4 T  Butter (or margarine)               2 t  Lemon juice
      3 T  Flour                               2 C  Vegetable stock or water
      1 C  Milk                              1/4 C  Parsley, fresh
      2 t  Dill weed                         1/2 C  Sour cream
 
  Saute onions in large pot with half the butter for 5 minutes.  Add
  mushrooms and crushed garlic along with dill, paprika, stock and tamari.
  Simmer covered for 15 minutes.
  
  In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat and stir in flour.  Whisk while
  heating for 2 minutes, then add milk.  Stir often for 10 minutes or until
  thick.  Combine mushroom mixture with sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.  Add
  sour cream.  Add lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste before serving.
  Top with chopped parsley.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich dill, paprika and mushroom soup -- I first saw this at "Old Wives
  Tale," a restaurant in Portland, Oregon.  The waiter there said that this
  had been on the menu every day for a year, and highly recommended it. The
  soup was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised to find a recipe for it in
  Molly Katzen's "Moosewood Cookbook." Yield: Serves 3-4.
  
  *  Tamari is a kind of soy sauce; if you can't find it, you can use
  ordinary soy sauce.

      Title: LIGHT HOLLANDAISE
 Categories: Sauces, Usenet
      Yield: 1 1/2 cups
 
      3 T  Lemon juice, fresh                  3    Eggs
      3 T  Water                               6 oz Butter, unsalted
    1/2 t  Salt                                     -(more as needed)
 
  Melt the butter in a small saucepan.  It should be warm, but not bubbling
  hot. Combine the lemon juice and water in a small sauce pan. Bring to a
  simmer, adding the salt.
  
  Meanwhile, place one egg and the yolks of the other two in a smallish
  saucepan.  Vigorously beat the egg and yolks with a wire whip for a minute
  or so, until they are pale and thick.
  
  Set the yolk mixture over moderately low heat and whisk in the hot lemon
  juice by driblets. Continue whisking, not too fast, but reaching all over
  the bottom and corners of the pan, until you have a foamy warm mass. Remove
  from heat just as you see a wisp of steam rising. (Do not overheat or you
  will coagulate the egg yolks.)
  
  Immediately start beating in the warm butter by driblets, to make a thick,
  creamy, light yellow sauce.  Taste carefully for seasoning, adding salt,
  pepper, and more lemon juice to taste.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick and easy Hollandaise sauce -- Few small things seem to impress
  dinner guests more than a good Hollandaise sauce.  Perhaps this is because
  the guests think it is difficult to execute. This recipe disproves that
  notion; it makes it simple to produce a consistently good Hollandaise
  sauce.  Use it over asparagus, to dip artichokes, with steak and rice, or
  for anything you can imagine. The original recipe comes from Julia Child &
  Company.
  
  *  This sauce is really so easy to make, you should leave it to the last
  minute.  It doesn't keep terribly well.  Any egg yolk and butter sauce can
  be kept only warm, not hot, or it will curdle. Also remember that sauces
  with egg yolks are prime breeding grounds for sick-making bacteria.
  
  *  Copper or stainless steel saucepans are best, as they transmit and hold
  heat better than anything else.  I often make this solely in Corningware
  pots, and find that sometimes the sauce will not set after removing from
  heat and adding the butter. In this case, return the mixture to very low
  heat, whisking vigorously until the sauce achieves the desired thickness.
  Too much heat will either curdle the egg yolks or cause the butter to
  separate from the mixture.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  5 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: DANDELION SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Dandelion greens, fresh           1/4 lb Cheddar cheese (sharp),
    1/2 C  Red onions,                              -grated
           -thinly sliced                    1/2 t  Black pepper
      2    Tomatoes, quartered               1/4 C  Salad oil
      1 t  Dill                                3 T  Vinegar
 
  Wash the dandelion greens carefully.  Drain well and cut into pieces.  Add
  the onions, tomatoes and cheese. Toss to mix.
  
  Make a salad dressing by mixing the pepper, salad oil, vinegar and dill.
  Dress the salad, toss and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Dinner salad made with dandelions and cheese -- The U.S. Department of
  Agriculture once had a big presence in the life of the average American.
  Their publications on home canning, gardening and cooking found their way
  into almost every household in the country.
  
  The USDA Food and Nutrition Service still exists, and they still produce
  books and pamphlets on every topic having to do with growing, eating and
  analyzing food. In this era of frozen food, microwave ovens and iceberg
  lettuce, there's much less demand for their books than there once was.
  
  In time for the Bicentennial, the USDA produced a book called "Favorite
  American Recipes," which is a non-copyrighted collection of traditional
  American rural and farm recipes.  All are simple and nutritious; most are
  also a little dull. Here's one that I like. Yield: serves 4.
  
  *  Make sure that you take the dandelion greens from a lawn that has not
  been treated with pesticides or anti-growth hormones recently. (Many lawn
  fertilizers also contain weed-control hormones).
  
  *  You can substitute a commercial salad dressing for the oil, vinegar,
  pepper and dill.

      Title: COLD NOODLES IN SPICY PEANUT SAUCE
 Categories: Entrees, Chinese, Pasta, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 T  Garlic, minced (fresh)              1 T  Hot bean paste
      3 T  Coriander, minced                        -(up to 2 T)
           -(fresh)                            1 T  Sesame oil
    1/2 C  Peanut butter                       1 lb Lo mein noodles (other
      5 oz Soy sauce, light                         -noodles will do,
      5 T  Sugar                                    -such as ramen noodles,
           Rice wine (between                       -or even spaghetti)
           -1/2 t to 1 T)                 
 
  Cook the lo mein according to directions.  Let cool.  Mix the rest of the
  ingredients.  Peanut butter doesn't mix very well, so for a few minutes
  you'll think you've made a mistake. Don't worry, just keep stirring until
  it's smooth. Add the sauce to the noodles.
  
  Hot bean sauce also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc.  This is the
  main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care.  Vary this
  ingredient to taste. This recipe is probably very good without it. It's
  also quite good served when the noodles are still hot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Mildly spicy cold noodles -- I first had this at Brandy Ho's in
  Chinatown, San Francisco. I forget where I found the recipe.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.

      Title: COCONUT JOYS
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 3 dozen
 
    1/4 lb Butter (or margarine)               2 C  Powdered sugar
      3 C  Coconut                             2 oz Chocolate (unsweetened),
           -(one standard package)                  -melted (2 squares)
 
  Melt butter in a sauce pan.  Remove from heat.  Add powdered sugar and
  coconut.  Mix well.
  
  Shape rounded teaspoons of mixture into balls.  Make an indent in center of
  each and place on cookie sheet.  Fill centers with melted chocolate.  Chill
  until firm.  Store in refrigerator.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Super-sweet, super-rich holiday cookies -- This is an easy recipe that
  can knock your socks off for flavor and sweetness. In other words, it will
  make your teeth fall out.
  
  *  We use sweetened coconut and also use semi-sweet chocolate.  This is why
  they make your teeth fall out.
  
  *  I tried an approach of melting the stick of margarine using the
  microwave on full for 48 seconds. While it was melting, I measured and
  mixed up the dry ingredients. I then poured half the liquid over the
  premixed coconut-sugar mixture; mixed some and poured in the remainder.
  This worked well for me, but my wife insists that the listed method is
  easier.
  
  *  Your clean thumb is the best way to make the indentations.
  
  *  Be sure to keep them in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

      Title: COCONUT MERINGUE DROPS
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 5 dozen
 
      3    Egg whites                          1 C  Coconut, shredded
      1 C  Sugar                                    Almonds, whole,
      1 t  Vanilla                                  -unblanched (optional)
 
  Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  In large bowl use an electric mixer to beat
  the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Gradually beat in sugar.  Add
  vanilla. With a rubber spatula gently fold in coconut.
  
  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto greased, floured cookie sheets.  Press an
  almond in center of each cookie.  Bake at 300 degrees F. for 20 to 25
  minutes. Remove to racks to cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Holiday cookies -- Coconut and almonds give this cookie a distinctive
  flavor.  For me the almonds are required.
  
  *  It is a lot of work to beat the egg whites enough without an electric
  mixer.
  
  *  This cookie must be handled a little more carefully than most as it
  forms a white shell which causes it to be slightly delicate.

      Title: STIR-FRIED CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Stir-fry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken breast,                   1/2 t  Salt
           -boneless                         1/2 C  Vegetable oil
     12    Mushrooms (white)                        -(peanut oil is best,
    1/2 lb Broccoli, fresh                          -but sunflower oil
           -(or 1 pk frozen)                        -is good, too)
    1/4 C  Chicken broth                     1/2 t  Cornstarch
      2 T  Soy sauce                           6 oz Bamboo shoots, canned
      2 T  Sherry                                   -(optional)
      1 T  Cornstarch                          6 oz Cashew nuts, broken
      1    Egg white                                -into large pieces
 
  Cut the boneless chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.  Wash and slice the
  mushrooms.  If using fresh broccoli, wash and cut it up into bite-sized
  pieces.  If using frozen broccoli, heat it or partially thaw it first.
  
  Combine chicken broth, soy sauce, sherry and about 1 T cornstarch.  Stir
  well and set aside.
  
  Combine beaten egg white, salt, about 1/2 t oil and about 2 t cornstarch.
  Add the chicken cubes to the mixture and stir until the chicken is
  well-coated. In a wok or deep cast iron pan, heat about 3 T vegetable oil
  until hot. Add the chicken pieces in small batches and stir continuously
  until golden brown. After each batch is finished, remove and drain. Add oil
  sparingly as needed.
  
  Stir fry the mushrooms in the wok.  Stir fry the broccoli in the wok.
  Combine the chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, bamboo shoots and cashew nuts in
  the wok. Stir fry to get everything warm again. Add the bouillon-cornstarch
  sauce and stir until thickened.
  
  Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be done at
  the same time as the chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chinese stir-fried chicken with broccoli and nuts.  Yield:  Serves 2-3.
  
  *  Bamboo shoots are available in cans at Chinese grocery stores.  Fresh
  broccoli is preferable to frozen, and it should be stir-fried for only a
  few minutes to keep it crunchy. Endless variations of this basic recipe are
  possible.  Beef, pork, or other lean meats can be substituted for the
  chicken. Tofu cubes or brown beans can be used to make this a vegetarian
  recipe. Chopped almonds can be used instead of cashews. Water chestnuts are
  a delightful addition. Green or red bell peppers can be used instead of
  broccoli.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes.

      Title: EASY SWEET AND SOUR CHICKEN

      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken breast,                    12 oz Pineapple chunks, canned
           -boneless                                -(drained, but reserve
      1 t  Ginger, chopped                          -about 1/2 cup of
      1    Egg white                                -the juice)
    1/2 t  Salt                                     SAUCE
      2 t  Cornstarch                          2 t  Sherry
    1/2 C  Vegetable oil                       2 t  Light soy sauce
           -(peanut oil is best,               1 T  Vinegar
           -but sunflower is                   1 t  Sugar
           -good, too)                         1 T  Cornstarch
      1    Green (bell) pepper                 1 t  Salt
      6    Carrots                        
 
  Cut up the chicken into bite-sized chunks.  Combine ginger, egg white,
  about 1/2 teaspoons each salt and cornstarch, and about 1 teaspoon oil. Add
  the chicken chunks and stir until the chicken is well-coated.
  
  Wash green pepper.  Discard seeds and stem.  Cut into strips about 1 x 1/4
  inches.  Peel carrots.  If they are thick, cut in half lengthwise.  Cut
  diagonally into pieces about 1 inch long.  Cook the carrots in boiling
  water for 3-5 minutes, depending how crunchy you like your carrots.
  
  Drain pineapple chunks, saving about 1/2 cup of the juice.  Prepare the
  sweet and sour sauce by mixing sherry, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, reserved
  pineapple juice, about 1 tablespoon cornstarch, and about 1 teaspoon salt.
  Stir well and set aside.
  
  Heat about 3 tablespoon of oil very hot in a wok or deep cast iron pan.
  Peanut oil is best since it has a high smoking point.  Stir-fry the chicken
  by putting a small batch (e.g., 5 pieces) of the cubed chicken in the wok
  and stirring continuously until golden brown. Remove to a dish. Repeat
  until all the chicken has been cooked, adding small amounts of oil as it
  gets used up.
  
  Heat about 1 tablespoon oil in an empty wok.  Stir fry the parboiled
  carrots and the green pepper for 30 seconds. Add the chicken and the
  pineapple chunks to the vegetables in the wok. Stir 1 minute or until well
  mixed and reheated. Add sweet and sour sauce to wok. Stir until thickened.
  
  Serve with rice.  I serve this recipe to company all the time and am amazed
  at how many people don't realize that you can cook Chinese food at home. It
  is always a big hit. The recipe works equally well with lean pork, tofu
  cubes, or soy beans instead of the chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A nice Chinese dinner you can make at home -- Don't forget to start
  cooking the rice so it will be done at the same time as the chicken.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes.

  Deep-fry the bean thread in small batches in about 2 cups oil.  Drain.
  
  Shred the green onions and lettuce.  Cut the coriander into about 1-inch
  lengths.  Place the chicken, lettuce, green onions and coriander in a large
  bowl.  Mix in the dry mustard.  Add the sesame oil, oil, soy sauce,
  vinegar, sesame seeds and bean thread. Mix well. Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken salad with Chinese seasonings -- This is a delicious salad my
  mother has been making for years.  She found the recipe in the cookbook
  that came with her wok. If you leave out the fried bean threads, this is a
  reasonably low-calorie dish.  And if you use all vegetable oils, there's
  almost no cholesterol in it (except for what's in the chicken).  Yield:
  serves 3-4.
  
  *  You can add garlic and ginger to the salad dressing that goes on the
  salad.
  
  *  This is also good hot, heat it just enough to get it hot and serve
  immediately.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  baking:  45 minutes; preparation:  20 minutes.

      Title: CHICKEN AND PINEAPPLE
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 1 serving
 
           Chicken (cooked), chopped          10 oz Chicken soup (or less;
      1 sm Onion, chopped                           -one small tin)
      6    Mushrooms, sliced                   4 oz Pineapple chunks
      1 T  Soya sauce                               -(one small tin)
      1 T  Cooking oil                    
 
  Heat the oil in a small frying pan.  Place the chopped onion in the frying
  pan and cook until the onion becomes soft and brown.
  
  Place the chicken and mushrooms into the frying pan and cook for 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally.  Place both the cans of soup and pineapple chunks
  into a small saucepan and heat until simmering.
  
  Place the cooked onion, chicken, mushrooms and soya sauce into the
  saucepan. Simmer until the sauce is reduced. This can take up to a quarter
  of an hour.
  
  Best served with brown rice or noodles.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken with pineapple and soya sauce -- This is my own recipe; it is a
  quick and easy meal for one person.  It's a nice thing to do with leftover
  chicken.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.

      Title: DEEP-FRIED LEMON CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Parties, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Green bell pepper                   1 lb Chicken breast,
      1    Red bell pepper                          -boneless

-----------------------------------BATTER-----------------------------------
    1/2 C  Flour                             1/2 t  Baking powder,
    1/4 C  Cornstarch                               -double-acting
    1/4 t  Salt                              1/2 t  Vegetable oil

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      1    Lemon                               1 t  Cornstarch
      3 T  Sugar                               2 t  Water
    1/2 C  Water                                    Parsley sprigs
 
  Wash and seed the peppers.  Cut each one into strips about 2 x 1/4 inches.
  Cut the boneless chicken breast into strips about 3 x 1/2 inches.
  
  Prepare the batter by mixing in a bowl the flour, cornstarch, baking
  powder, salt, water and oil. Stir until smooth.
  
  Cut half of the lemon into thin semicircular slices.  Prepare the lemon
  sauce by squeezing the juice from the other half of the lemon and combining
  in a cup with the sugar and water. Stir well.
  
  Combine about 1 teaspoon cornstarch and about 2 teaspoon water in a second
  cup.  This mixture will be used later to thicken the lemon sauce.  Dip each
  piece of chicken in the batter and let the excess drip back into the bowl.
  
  Deep fry the chicken in small batches.  It is best to use an electric deep
  fryer, but if this is not available, heat about 1 quart of vegetable oil in
  a wok or deep pan until it is very hot. Then add about 5 pieces of chicken
  at a time to the oil and cook, covered, for about 5 minutes or until a
  golden brown crust forms. Check once a minute to see if the pieces are
  sticking together, and if so, separate them. After each batch is finished,
  set aside on a paper towel to drain off the excess oil.
  
  Cook the lemon sauce by pouring the lemon-sugar mixture into a saucepan and
  bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch-water mixture and stir until
  thickened.
  
  To please the eye as well as the palate, mix up the chicken and colored
  pepper pieces and pile on a plate. Top with sprigs of parsley and place the
  lemon slices around the outside of the plate. Put the hot lemon sauce in a
  cup so that people can pour it over their chicken just before eating, to
  keep it crispy.
  
  Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be done at
  the same time as the chicken.
  
  A nice-looking dish for company.  The deep-fried chicken pieces can also be
  served as party snacks instead of junk food.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Crispy chunks of chicken in sweet lemon sauce.  Yield:  Serves 2-3.
  
  : Difficulty:  With an electric deep fryer, easy; without one, moderate.
  : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the batter ingredients.

      Title: CELERY ROOT SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Celery root                       1/2 t  Black pepper,
           -(also called celeriac)                  -freshly ground
      4 C  Water (salted), boiling             1    Garlic clove, crushed
      6 T  Olive oil                         3/4 t  Dill weed, dried
      3 T  White wine vinegar                       -(use more if fresh)
      1 t  Salt                              1/3 C  Scallions, minced
      2 t  Sugar                             1/3 C  Parsley, minced
  1 1/4 t  Mustard,  dry                  
 
  Peel the celery root and cut it into 1/2-inch cubes.  Add the cubed celery
  root to the boiling salted water and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
  Drain.
  
  Combine the rest of the ingredients and whisk or shake to make a dressing.
  Pour the dressing over the cooked celery root and toss.  Refrigerate at
  least two hours before serving.
  
  Celery root (also called celeriac) is sometimes hard to find.  Try to get
  ones about the size of a large fist; smaller ones have too much waste, and
  bigger ones are often pithy. This vegetable is not worth eating raw.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cooked celery root in vinaigrette -- This salad has an intense celery
  flavor.  The taste is so strong that it should be served only with other
  strongly flavored foods.  It would overwhelm veal, but would go well with a
  lamb roast.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      4    Eggs, separated                   1/2 t  Cinnamon
  1 1/2 C  Sugar                               1 t  Vanilla extract
      1 C  Carrots, grated                     1 pn Salt
      1 C  Walnuts, finely grated              1 C  Oil
  1 1/2 C  Flour                           2 1/2 t  Water, hot
      1 t  Baking powder                     1/2 t  Baking soda
    1/4 t  Nutmeg                        

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      8 oz Cream cheese                      1/2 C  Jam (strawberry,
    1/2 C  Sugar                                    -apricot or raspberry)

----------------------------------FROSTING----------------------------------
      1 C  Whipping cream                      2 T  Sugar
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together egg yolks and about 1 cup of
  the sugar until the yolk color lightens.  Stir in carrots, nuts, flour,
  baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, salt and oil. Mix together hot
  water and soda and stir into flour mixture.
  
  Beat egg whites until foamy.  Gradually add remaining sugar.  Beat until
  stiff and glossy. Fold egg white mixture into flour mixture.
  
  Turn mixture into a greased pan, 13 x 9-inch, lined with greased wax paper
  and bake for 45 minutes or until done. Cool. Slice in half horizontally, to
  form two layers.
  
  Make the cream cheese filling:  soften the cream cheese and beat in the
  sugar, mixing gradually, until the filling is smooth and fluffy. A food
  processor works well for this.
  
  Cover bottom layer with cream cheese filling, then cover cream cheese layer
  with jam.  Place the top layer of the cake carefully on top of the jam.
  
  Make the frosting:  beat the whipping cream until slightly stiff, then add
  the sugar and beat the mixture to stiff peaks. Frost the entire cake with
  whipped cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Carrot cake with cream cheese filling -- I got this recipe originally
  from _The Oregonian_ in Portland, Oregon.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling, 10 minutes
  frosting.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: POTATO-CARROT KUGEL
 Categories: Vegetables, Entrees, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 lg Potatoes, peeled                1 1/2 t  Salt
           -(about 4 lb)                       1 t  Sugar
      4    Carrots, peeled                     4 T  Flour, all-purpose
      1 lg Onion, peeled                     1/2 t  Black pepper, ground
      2 md Eggs                                2 T  Parsley, chopped
      4 T  Chicken fat, melted                      Paprika
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Grease a pan that is about 8x8 inches.
  
  Break one egg into blender; start blender at high speed.  Add half of
  onion, three of the potatoes (cut up into about 1-inch pieces) and two of
  the carrots (cut up into similar pieces). Blend till smooth. Empty blender
  into large mixing bowl. Repeat with other egg and remainder of onion,
  potatoes and carrots.
  
  Stir in chicken fat, salt, sugar, flour, black pepper and parsley.  Pour
  into pan, sprinkle top with paprika, and bake for 1 hour or until browned.
  
  For a pareve version, substitute for the chicken fat about 4 tablespoons
  vegetable oil, and for flavor, optionally substitute for the salt and sugar
  about 1 tablespoon pareve imitation chicken soup mix (I use Croyden House
  brand, made in USA).  It is supposedly pareve/kosher for Passover.  For
  kosher l'pesach (Passover), use about 4 tablespoon matzo meal, plus about 1
  tablespoon potato starch in place of the flour.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Kugel with potatoes and carrots -- I have adapted this recipe from a
  recipe for "Blender potato kugel" by Marilyn Michelson in the "Temple
  Emanuel Sisterhood Cook Book," compiled 1968 (no copyright notice),
  Baltimore, Maryland. The carrot part is my idea (it gives the kugel a
  golden color and also a better flavor, I think). This dish smells
  wonderful, tastes great, and is definitely filling.
  
  With suitable modifications (see notes) this dish can be made kosher for
  Passover.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHALUPA
 Categories: Entrees, Mexican, Crockpot, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Pinto beans                         1 T  Salt
      3 lb Pork roast                          2 T  Chili powder
      7 C  Water                               1 T  Cumin
    1/2 C  Onion, chopped                      1 t  Oregano
      2    Garlic cloves,                      4 oz Green chili peppers,
           -minced                                  -chopped (one can)
 
  Put all ingredients in a dutch oven, an electric crockery cooker, or a
  heavy kettle. Cover and simmer about 5 hours, or until the roast falls
  apart and the beans are done. Uncover and cook about 1/2 hour, until the
  desired thickness is achieved.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Mexican meat and bean dish, similar to chili -- I got this recipe from
  "A Primer on Bean Cookery" by the California Dry Bean Advisory Board. While
  not a true chili, chalupa is a Mexican-American favorite for a hearty lunch
  or supper. It may be made ahead and reheated, and it freezes well.
  
  *  Chili powder is a mixture of spices, consisting mainly of ground dried
  chili peppers.  This recipe may be served with corn chips and condiments
  (including chopped tomato, chopped avocado, chopped onion, shredded
  lettuce, grated cheddar cheese and hot sauce).
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 5-6 hours cooking.

      Title: CHALLAH I
 Categories: Breads, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 2 loaves
 
  2 1/4 C  Water                             1/4 C  Oil
      1 T  Yeast (active),                     2    Eggs, beaten
           -dry (one package)                 10 C  Flour (or less)
      1 T  Sugar                               1    Egg yolk
      1 T  Salt (optional)                     1 T  Water
 
  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in lukewarm water (105 degrees F.).  (Lukewarm
  water feels neither hot nor cold when a drop is placed on your wrist.)  Let
  sit for 10 minutes to proof the yeast.  If there are no bubbles in the
  water after this time, the yeast is inactive and you should start over with
  new yeast.
  
  Add the salt (optional), oil, eggs and most of the flour to the 2 1/4 cups
  of water. Mix. Place dough on floured board and knead for 5-10 minutes.
  
  Place dough in a clean bowl, brush some oil on the top (optional) and cover
  the bowl with a towel.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2
  hours.
  
  Punch the dough down and let rise until doubled again (maybe another hour).
  
  Punch dough down and place onto floured board.  Form into two loaves.  You
  can make normal loaves, or you can cut the dough and braid (with three or
  six pieces per loaf), or you can make braided or un-braided rolls, or you
  can roll the dough out until it's about 1/4 inch thick and then spread
  fried onions over it. Place loaves into oiled pans.
  
  Cover pans and let rise for about 30 minutes.  (Skip this step if you've
  rolled the dough out and covered with onions.)
  
  Mix the egg yolk with about 1 tablespoon of water.  Brush loaves with this
  mixture.  (Again, skip this if you've rolled the dough out.)  Bake at 400
  degrees F. for 20 minutes, then lower heat to 350 degrees F. and bake for
  40 additional minutes. If you are making rolls, you probably need to bake
  for a total of 20-25 minutes.
  
  You can add poppy or sesame seeds to the dough, or you can sprinkle the
  seeds on top. This bread is traditionally made with white flour, but is
  still good if made with all or part whole wheat flour. I think its good
  taste comes from the oil and eggs in the dough.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Challah is a traditional Jewish bread that is part of many festivals,
  including sabbath dinners and weddings.  For making a wedding loaf, this
  recipe can be doubled and used to make one braided loaf.  It will fill up
  the entire oven, and you will have to find a cookie sheet big enough to put
  the loaf on. Yield: 2 loaves.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, as bread goes.
  : Time:  preparation:  3-5 hours (including rising); baking:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  measure ingredients carefully.

      Title: CHALLAH II, Part 1 of 2
 Categories: Breads, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 2 loaves
 
-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
    1/2 oz Yeast (active),                   3/4 C  Vegetable oil
           -dry (2 packages)                        -(up to about 1/4 cup
      2 C  Water, warm                              -more, to taste)
      4 t  Salt                                9 C  Flour, all-purpose
    1/2 C  Sugar, granulated                        -(more if needed)
      3 lg Eggs                 

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
      1 lg Egg                                      Sesame or poppy seeds
 
  Mix yeast in warm water.  Let sit 5 minutes.  In a large bowl combine salt,
  sugar, eggs and oil.  Add yeast mixture.  Slowly add flour, stirring until
  not too sticky. When the dough becomes too thick to stir, turn it out onto
  a floured board and knead, adding flour as necessary. Scrape the working
  surface with a plastic dough spatula from time to time, to keep a dry skin
  from forming on it.  You may find that you need more flour, but don't add
  too much more, or the dough will become heavy. Knead until the dough is
  smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes).
  
  Form dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled large bowl, turning to
  coat the dough with oil.  A ceramic bowl is best.  Cover the bowl with a
  clean cloth and leave in a warm, draft-free place to rise for 1 1/2 hours,
  or until doubled in bulk. After the dough has risen, punch it down and
  divide it into 6 balls. Let the dough balls sit for 5 minutes, covered.
  
  Keeping dough balls covered while working, remove a ball and roll it
  between your hands (or on working surface) into a cord about 1 inch wide by
  about 20 inches long. The dough is quite elastic, making it nicely
  workable, yet also tending to make it shrink back slightly after being
  lengthened.  I find it best to lengthen it in a series of passes. Form 3
  cords this way, and then start from the middle and braid them into a single
  loaf.  Tuck the ends under. It's a little harder to figure out how to start
  braiding from the middle, but the loaves come out more even and attractive
  that way.  Don't pull the cords while braiding. Place the loaf on a lightly
  oiled baking sheet, and cover it with a cloth while you form the other
  loaf.  Keep the loaves well apart on the baking sheet, since they will
  expand a lot.  Cover the loaves and place again into a warm, draft-free
  place to rise for 45-60 minutes.
  
  After the loaves have risen, gently brush the tops with beaten egg using a
  soft brush, and then sprinkle with the seeds.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for
  30 minutes, or until golden brown.

  : Continued from Part 1
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Challah (pronounced "hallah") is a type of braided egg bread
  traditionally eaten on the Jewish Sabbath. It is eaten by tearing off hunks
  rather than by cutting with a knife.
  
  I got this recipe from a housemate a couple of years ago; I don't know its
  origins before that, but it has become one of my favorite recipes, and one
  with which I have experimented a good deal.  I've tried several other
  challah recipes, but find I like this one the best. Yield: 2 Large loaves.
  
  *  The variation in oil makes quite a difference in the moisture of the
  bread: If you use the larger quantity, the bread comes out very nice and
  moist, but when it cools it becomes somewhat oily.
  
  The amounts of sugar and oil may sound high, but try it this way once
  before cutting back. I have tried other recipes that use less, and they
  don't taste nearly as good.
  
  *  Here's the fun part --> variations.  Because this dough is so workable,
  you can form it many different ways, limited only by your imagination; I
  once made a whole collection of different shapes and sizes, for a festive
  dinner party.
  
  Some of the variations I have tried include:
  
  :  o  Adding extra ingredients, such as raisins and/or nuts
  :  o  Forming the braided loaf into a wreath-like loop (joining the ends)
  :  o  Braiding 5 ways instead of 3
  :  o  Baking a small loaf on top of a larger loaf (traditional)
  :  o  Braiding 3 braided loaves into a recursive loaf (didn't turn out
  well; it ended up looking knotty, rather than intricate, and being somewhat
  tough)
  :  o  Varying the loaf sizes.  One time I made individual-sized loaves, so
  that everyone could have their own loaf at dinner.  Another time, I divided
  the dough into 2 halves, set one aside, and made a loaf out of the other
  half. Then, I divided the remaining piece into 2 halves, and continued the
  process until I had an array of loaves, each half the size of the previous.
  I managed to get 9 loaves by doing this, the smallest of which was about
  1/4 inch by about 2 inches.
  
  :  o  Varying the length-to-width proportions; traditionally, challah
  loaves are quite wide relative to their length. I find that shorter, wider
  loaves are doughier (and thus tastier), but longer loaves look more
  elegant.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes dough preparation, 1 1/2 hours first rising, 1 hour
  loaf forming, 1 hour second rising, 30 minutes baking. Total: 4 1/2 hours.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHALLAH III
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 4 loaves
 
    3/4 oz Yeast (3 packages)                  1 T  Salt
    3/4 C  Water, water                      1/4 C  Honey
      2 t  Sugar                               2 C  Raisins
    1/2 C  Sugar                               8    Eggs
    1/2 C  Butter, melted                      9 C  Flour

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
      2    Egg yolks                           5 t  Water
 
  Dissolve the yeast with the warm water and sugar.  Add the rest of the
  sugar, butter, salt, honey, raisins and eggs. Add the flour, a cup at a
  time, until it is hard to stir.
  
  Turn out onto a well-floured counter and knead until smooth and blistery,
  adding more flour as necessary (about 10-15 minutes).  Put into greased
  bowl, cover, and let rise until double, about 1 hr.
  
  Punch down.  Separate into 4 sections and separate each section into  3
  more sections. Roll each piece out to the size of your cookie sheet. Braid
  3 strands together and place on cookie sheet. Let rise until double (about
  1 hour).
  
  Mix egg yolks and water for glaze.  Spread on loaves.  Bake in a preheated
  oven at 350 degrees F. for 15-30 minutes until there is a golden crust.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Jewish egg bread -- This is my family's version of Challah.  It calls
  for saffron, but I've never actually made it as such (Hey, I'm just a poor
  college student, I can't afford saffron).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, if you know how to make bread
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours rising, 30 minutes cooking
  : Precision:  Raisins are to taste.  Measure the rest of the ingredients.

      Title: BUTTER COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 2 dozen
 
    1/2 C  Butter (unsalted),                  1 lg Egg
           -at room temperature                1 t  Vanilla extract
    1/2 C  Sugar, granulated               1 1/2 t  Baking powder
  1 1/2 C  Flour, white                   
 
  Beat the butter with the sugar.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat until you
  get a uniform mixture.  Mix the flour and baking powder and gradually blend
  them into the mixture.  When you're done, you should have a rather sticky
  dough.
  
  Shape the dough into balls, about 1 inch in diameter.  Roll them in sugar
  and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet, leaving about an inch of space
  between cookies, so that they don't stick together when they expand.
  
  Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven,
  let them cool for a while, and start eating right away.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  After reading the ingredients on a can of imported Danish butter
  cookies, I thought: "Hey! I can do this myself!", so I developed the
  following recipe. It doesn't resemble the original too much, but
  considering that the cookies don't stay around for more than two days, and
  that even my mother liked them, they must be good! Yield: Makes 2-3 dozen
  cookies.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: DOUBLE-FROSTED BROWNIES
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 1 dozen
 
-----------------------------------BATTER-----------------------------------
      2 oz Chocolate, unsweetened              1 t  Vanilla extract
           -(2 squares)                      1/2 C  Flour
    1/4 lb Butter                            1/4 t  Salt
      2 lg Eggs                              1/2 C  Nuts, chopped
      1 C  Sugar                                    -(walnuts are traditional)

-------------------------------FIRST FROSTING-------------------------------
  1 1/2 C  Sugar                                    -called light cream)
    1/3 C  Butter                              1 t  Vanilla extract
    1/2 C  Half-and-half (also           

------------------------------SECOND FROSTING------------------------------
      3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened                   -(3 squares)
 
  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Melt about 2 oz of chocolate and the
  butter in a heavy saucepan, then let it cool. Be careful not to let the
  chocolate burn.
  
  Beat the eggs in a large bowl until they are blended.  Add about 1 cup 200
  g of sugar and mix well. Stir in chocolate-and-butter mixture. Mix until
  the chocolate is fully incorporated, with no streakiness. Add the vanilla,
  flour, salt and nuts. Stir just until the flour is incorporated;
  over-stirring will make a tough brownie.
  
  Spread the mixture in a greased pan, about 11 x 7 inches, that is about 1
  1/2 inches deep. Bake in pre-heated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the
  pan on a rack. While it is cooling, follow these instructions to make the
  first frosting:
  
  Mix about 1 1/2 cups sugar, about 1/3 cup butter and about 1/2 cup of
  half-and-half in a heavy, medium-size saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then cook
  over moderate heat without stirring until a small amount of the mixture
  forms a soft ball when dropped in ice water, or it reaches 236 degrees F.
  on a candy thermometer.
  
  Remove from heat immediately and cool in a pan of ice-water until the candy
  is lukewarm. DANGER: melted sugar cools very slowly. You can burn yourself
  badly by testing it with your finger.
  
  Add about 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the candy.  Beat it until it is
  creamy and of a spreading consistency. This is most easily done with an
  electric mixer, although you can use a heavy wire whip. Spread the frosting
  over the brownies.
  
  Melt the remaining 3 oz chocolate and spread over the frosting just put on
  the brownies. Cover as evenly as possible. Cool for several hours in a
  refrigerator, then bring to room temperature and cut into pieces to serve.
  
  Be very careful when melting chocolate.  It burns easily.  A double boiler
  is probably the best way thing to use.
  
  It is critical to cook the first frosting to just the right point.  If
  cooked too little, it will be too thin to beat to a creamy consistency. If
  cooked too much, it will be too brittle. So keep a close eye on it; sugar
  tends to cook slowly to the soft-ball stage, then it cooks quickly.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very rich brownies with double frosting -- This recipe is for people who
  like intense chocolate flavor.  The result is a brownie with a fondant
  frosting, covered with unsweetened chocolate.  They are very rich, with an
  interesting combination of textures.  This recipe is not for beginners.
  
  : Difficulty:  difficult.
  : Time:  a few hours preparation, several hours chilling and then warming
  : Precision:  measure ingredients carefully.

      Title: EGGS AND MUSHROOMS
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 lg Eggs                                1 sm Onion, chopped
      2 T  Butter                            1/2 t  Parsley, dried
    1/2 lb Mushrooms (fresh),                       Salt and pepper
           -sliced                                  -(to taste)
      2 T  Flour                               2 T  Butter, melted
    1/2 C  White cooking wine                3/4 C  Monterey Jack
    1/2 C  Chicken broth                            -cheese, grated
      3 T  Mayonnaise                     
 
  Saute mushrooms in about 2 tablespoons butter.  Stir in flour.  Blend well.
  Add wine, broth, mayonnaise, onion, parsley, salt and pepper.  Cook,
  stirring until sauce is smooth.
  
  Pour sauce in shallow baking dish.  Break eggs over sauce, taking care not
  to break the yolk (it makes serving easier if the eggs are distributed
  symmetrically in the dish.) Pour about 2 tablespoons melted butter over
  eggs. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F. until eggs are cooked to
  your liking. (I like the yolks hard, so I bake for about 20 minutes.)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Eggs poached in mushroom sauce -- I got this recipe off the side of a
  bottle of cooking wine (which I had purchased for another recipe).  It
  turned out to be so good that I used up the rest of the bottle in repeat
  performances.
  
  *  If you use ordinary white wine instead of cooking wine, add about 1/2
  teaspoon of salt to it.
  
  *  You can use any mild cheddar cheese in place of the Monterey Jack.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10-20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SECOND DAY APPLE SQUARES
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 C  White flour, unbleached             1 C  Sour cream (or yogurt)
      2 C  Brown sugar, firmly packed          1 t  Vanilla extract
    1/2 C  Butter (or margarine)               1    Egg
      1 C  Chopped nuts (optional)             2 C  Apples, peeled and
      2 t  Cinnamon (or less)                       -finely chopped
      1 t  Soda                                     -(about 2 apples)
    1/2 t  Salt                           
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown
  sugar and margarine.  Blend at low speed, until the mixture forms fine
  crumbs. If you want to include them, stir in the nuts now. Place about 2
  3/4 cups of the crumb mixture into an ungreased pan, about 13 x 9 inches.
  Press down firmly.
  
  Add the remaining ingredients (except for the apples) to the remaining
  crumb mixture. Blend well. Stir the chopped apples into the batter. Spoon
  the batter evenly over the crumb base in the pan. Bake at 350 degrees F.
  for 30-40 minutes. If you use the larger pan, bake for 25-30 minutes. Cool
  before cutting.  Better yet, let it wait 24 hours before cutting.  Store
  loosely covered.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sugary, moist apple squares -- Try to avoid eating very many of these
  squares on the day you make them, as they improve immeasurably on the
  second and third day! This recipe originally came from a Pillsbury
  bake-off. Yield: Makes 12-15 squares.

      Title: STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB PIE
 Categories: Pies, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
---------------------------------PIE CRUST---------------------------------
  2 1/4 C  Flour                               5 T  Milk, cold
    3/4 C  Shortening                               -(can use water)

--------------------------------PIE FILLING--------------------------------
      1 C  Sugar                               6 T  Tapioca (tapioca
      1 lb Rhubarb, cut into                        -starch preferred,
           -1/2-inch pieces                         -but quick-cooking
      6 C  Strawberries (or less)                   -tapioca is okay, too)
 
  Cut the strawberries in half.  Place in a bowl with the rhubarb and add the
  sugar and tapioca.  Mix and let sit for at least 15 minutes. Make the pie
  crust:  Cut the shortening and flour together.  This can be done with two
  knives, with a pastry cutter, or with some electric mixers.  (I do mine in
  a Kitchen Aid food processor/mixer.) When the mixture has an even
  consistency (it should resemble coarse sand), add in the milk (or water).
  Take about 5/8ths of the dough and roll out on a floured board until it is
  a little bit larger than a 10-inch pie pan. Put this in the pie pan. (The
  rest of the dough is for the top of the pie.)
  
  Pour the strawberries and rhubarb mixture into the pie crust.  Roll out the
  remainder of the pie crust.  Place on top of the pie, crimping the edges of
  the top and bottom crusts together.  Make one or two slits in the top of
  the crust for steam to escape. Bake 45 to 50 minutes at 400 degrees F. or
  until Ayrup boils with heavy bubbles that do not burst.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A sweet and tart dessert, this recipe came from the _Los Angeles Times_
  about 15 years ago.
  
  *  Strawberries and rhubarb are both seasonal fruits.  Their season is late
  spring/early summer.
  
  *  You can use about 3/4 cup sugar if you like it less sweet.
  
  *  I recommend putting a piece of aluminum foil under the pie as it is
  cooking, because it invariably leaks.  This will save you from having to
  clean up the oven.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  Preparation:  20-25 minutes; baking:  45-50 minutes; cooling:  30
  minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the crust ingredients!

  together until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add salt, vanilla and
  almond extract. Beat well. Add eggs, one at a time, blending well after
  each.
  
  Stir in flour.  Don't be vigorous; mix it just enough to incorporate the
  flour.  Spoon into a greased tube pan.  Bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2
  hours.  Cool for 15-20 minutes, then invert the cake onto a serving dish
  and remove the tube pan. If you wait too long, it will stick.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A pound cake made with cream cheese -- I got this recipe from Annette
  Hall at Computer System Resources, in Georgia (annette@gacsr.UUCP). She
  posted it to net.cooks, claiming that it's the best pound cake you'll ever
  taste. She's right! Yield: One large cake.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy

      Title: GERMAN FRIENDSHIP CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Sourdough, Usenet
      Yield: 1 cake
 
      1 C  Cake starter                  

--------------------------------STARTER FOOD--------------------------------
      1 C  Milk                                1 C  Sugar
      1 C  Flour, self-raising           

------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      2 C  Flour, self-raising                 2    Eggs
      1 C  Sugar                             1/2 C  Raisins
    2/3 C  Oil                               1/2 C  Nuts (or other fruits)
      2 t  Cinnamon                           15 oz Pineapple chunks,
      2 t  Vanilla extract                          -drained (one can)
 
  PREPARE STARTER:
  
  Day 1:  Blend the starter feed together, and then hand mix in the starter.
  I find it easiest to mix the flour and sugar together dry, add the milk
  to the starter, and then slowly add the flour and sugar to the liquid. The
  starter should never be beaten with a blender or refrigerated. Pour the
  mixture into a large bowl, cover with cling-film or a damp towel, and leave
  to brew.
  
  Day 2:  Thoroughly mix the sourdough, then leave to brew again.
  
  Day 5:  As day 1
  
  Day 6:  As day 2
  
  Day 10:  Print off three copies of this recipe.  Here now is why this is
  called a friendship cake.  Take 3 cups of Sourdough mixture, and give them
  away with copies of the recipe  as starters to your friends. Then proceed
  with the baking.
  
  MAKING THE CAKE:  Blend all ingredients thoroughly with remaining starter.
  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Pour mixture into a well-greased baking
  tin. Bake for 1 3/4 hours (less in a fan oven), cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A 10-day Sourdough cake -- This is known as the friendship cake, it's a
  bit like a chain letter in that you have to find a set of friends to pass
  on the starter to.
  
  During preparation put the starter into a very large bowl (it foams up),
  and cover with a lid or with cling film. Yield: Starter and one cake.
  
  *  If you don't get cake starter from a friend, you can probably buy it in
  a baking supply store.
  
  *  Vary the spices to taste.  The cake is quite pleasant if you forget
  them.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 days brewing starter, 30 minutes preparing cake, 2 hours baking
  and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: HOBEE'S COFFEE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
  1 1/2 C  Flour (unbleached),                 1 C  Sour cream
           -sifted                           1/2 t  Vanilla
      1 C  Sugar,  granulated                1/4 C  Blueberries, fresh,
      2 t  Baking powder                            -optional (or other
    1/2 t  Baking soda                              -fruit, or nuts such
    1/4 t  Salt                                     -as walnuts)
      2    Eggs                                     Vegetable oil

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      5 T  Sugar,  granulated                1/2 t  Cinnamon, ground
      2 T  Butter                         
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large mixing bowl, resift sift flour
  with baking power, baking soda, salt and about 1 cup of sugar.
  
  In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs, sour cream and vanilla.  Add
  egg mixture to flour mixture and beat until smooth.
  
  Oil a 9-inch square baking pan (you can also use an 8 inch square pan, or
  anything of similar surface area, if you increase the baking time by about
  5 minutes).
  
  Spread the batter in the pan.  If you are using fruit or nuts, scatter them
  over the batter and stir a little bit so that they stay in the top layer.
  
  In a small bowl, mix about 5 T sugar with the butter and cinnamon with a
  sturdy fork, until they are blended and resemble cornmeal (i.e., you should
  have a mixture of fine crumbs, not a smooth mixture).  Sprinkle topping
  over batter. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until a clean toothpick inserted in
  the center of the cake comes out dry. Cool slightly; serve warm or at room
  temperature.  Don't ruin it by serving it with salted butter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Coffee cake from "Hobee's Haven" restaurant here in Silicon Valley
  (usually just called "Hobee's") serves a lot of brunch food, and as far as
  I can tell they always include a piece of their coffee cake with each
  order. Frankly, I don't care for breakfast, nor do I approve of places at
  which the only kind of tea you can order reeks of orange and cinnamon...
  but the coffee cake is pretty good. This is their recipe, printed in an
  advertising flyer for the shopping center they inhabit; it's quite easy.
  
  *  All ingredients and bowls should be a room temperature before you start;
  this is particularly true for the butter.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10-15 minutes preparation, 20-30 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: PASSOVER CHOCOLATE NUT TORTE
 Categories: Desserts, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 12 servings
 
-----------------------------------TORTE-----------------------------------
      6 oz Butter (or margarine)               1 C  Almonds (unblanched),
    3/4 C  Sugar                                    -finely ground
      7    Eggs, separated                   1/2 t  Baking powder
      4 oz Chocolate (bittersweet),          1/4 C  Almonds (unblanched),
           -melted and cooled                       -chopped

-----------------------------------ICING-----------------------------------
      4    Eggs, lightly beaten                     -melted
    1/2 t  Potato starch                       4 oz Margarine, softened
      4 oz Chocolate (bittersweet),          1/2 C  Almonds, finely ground
 
  TO MAKE TORTE:  Cream the butter and gradually beat in the sugar until the
  mixture is light and creamy.  Beat in the yolks, one at a time.  Blend in
  the chocolate, and gently fold in the ground almonds mixed with the baking
  powder. Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry, then fold into the
  mixture.
  
  Pour into a well-greased 10-inch springform pan.  Bake about 30 minutes in
  an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. degrees. Allow to cool, then frost
  thickly with the icing and sprinkle with the chopped nuts.
  
  TO MAKE ICING:  Mix together the eggs, sugar and potato starch in the top
  of a double boiler. Heat over boiling water, stirring, until mixture
  thickens.
   Do not boil the mixture, and beware of "scrambled eggs!" Cool, then stir
  in the chocolate.
  
  Gradually beat in the butter, one tablespoon at a time.  Fold in the nuts
  until the mixture is thick enough to spread.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rich chocolate dessert for Passover.  This is the only Passover dessert
  I've ever tasted that is good enough to be making during the rest of the
  year as well (when you can use corn starch instead of the potato starch).
  
  *  If you don't have a springform pan for Passover, use an aluminum
  disposable cake pan and just strip off the sides when the cake has cooled.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking, 5 minutes frosting.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: PASSOVER ROLLS
 Categories: Breads, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 12 rolls
 
      2 C  Matzah meal                         1 C  Water
      1 t  Salt                              1/2 C  Peanut oil
      1 T  Sugar                               4    Eggs
 
  Combine matzah meal with salt and sugar.  In a medium saucepan, bring oil
  and water to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the matzah
  meal, mixing well.
  
  Beat in the eggs thoroughly, one at a time (this is where it starts to get
  sticky).  Let the mixture stand for about 15 minutes (can be refrigerated).
  
  With well-oiled hands, shape it into rolls and place on a well-greased
  cookie sheet (you will have to keep re-oiling your hands). Bake in a
  preheated 375 degree F. oven for 50 minutes or until golden brown.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Bread-like Passover rolls -- This recipe comes from a poster-sized sheet
  of recipes printed by Manischewitz many years ago (probably before I was
  born). Besides making reasonably good mock "rolls," it's also great fun for
  kids to make (very sticky!).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  35 minutes preparation (including waiting), 50 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: MATZO BREI
 Categories: Breakfast, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    Matzot (plural of                        Oil or margarine
           -matzah)                          1/4 C  Cottage cheese, well-
      2    Eggs (or 3)                              -drained (optional)
           Salt and pepper, to taste      
 
  Break matzot into medium-sized pieces and place in colander or strainer.
  Pour boiling water over them and drain quickly (they should be slightly
  limp, not soggy). Mix together matzot, eggs and seasoning in a bowl. (You
  can add cottage cheese at this point.)
  
  Heat the margarine or oil in a frying pan, and pour in the mixture.  You
  can either (a) heat one side until brown, then flip over, like an omelette
  or (b) heat while continually stirring, like scrambled eggs (my tradition).
  Serve hot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional Passover breakfast -- When I was growing up, the main thing
  that kept us kids happy about matzah-for-eight-days was my father making
  "matzah 'n' eggs" for breakfast nearly every morning.  I didn't even know
  it had a "real" name. As I was beginning to stock my own kitchen, the very
  first Passover items I bought were a bowl, a colander and a frying pan.
  Yield: Serves 1-2.
  
  *  Any printed recipe for matzo brei that I've ever seen says "serve with
  honey or jam."  However, in our family, this dish is considered a savoury,
  not a sweet, and we're much likelier to sprinkle a bit more salt and pepper
  on top.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes.
  : Precision:  is to laugh.

      Title: CHAROSET
 Categories: Condiments, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 2 cups
 
  1 1/2 C  Nuts, finely chopped                2 C  Apples (or less),
           -(e.g., almonds, walnuts,                -chopped or grated
           -filberts)                               -(about 4-6 medium
      2 T  Sugar or honey (or a                     -apples)
           -mixture)                                Sweet wine
    1/2 t  Cinnamon              
 
  Mix nuts, sugar, honey, apples and cinnamon together until well-blended.
  Add wine slowly until the texture resembles a thick paste, like mortar.
  Taste and adjust cinnamon, sugar, wine amounts.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional Seder accompaniment -- This paste-like, sweet spread is a
  prescribed part of the traditional Seder.  Its mortar-like consistency is
  intended to remind Jews of the bricks and mortar our ancestors labored with
  as slaves in Egypt. Quite incidentally, it is delicious and tastes
  wonderful spread on matzah. This is the traditional charoset from the
  Ashkenazic (Eastern European) Jewish tradition; very different, but equally
  delicious, charoset recipes, using such ingredients as dates, raisins and
  sesame, can be found in the various Sephardic communities (e.g., Yemenite,
  Persian, Turkish, Moroccan, etc.).
  
  *  This recipe yields about enough for the Seder table.  If you like this
  as much as we do, you will want to make more.
  
  *  Some people prefer a chunkier, less smoothly-blended charoset.
  
  *  If you live in an area where Kosher for Passover ground nuts (not
  groundnuts) are available, they save a lot of chopping time and lead to a
  smoother consistency.  If you're lucky enough to have a Kosher for Passover
  food processor, you will also save a lot of arm exercise.  And remember,
  kids love to chop!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes to several hours, depending on how much hand-chopping
  you have to do.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: MOROCCAN FISH
 Categories: Fish, Hot, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      5    Garlic cloves, chopped              2 T  Cilantro, chopped
      2 T  Cumin                                    Juice of 1/2 lemon
      2 T  Olive oil                           1 lb Red snapper filets
      1 T  Pepper flakes, dried           
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix garlic, cumin, olive oil, pepper
  flakes, cilantro and lemon juice into a paste.
  
  Put the filets in a shallow baking dish and spread this paste over them.
  Cover tightly with foil.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 5 to 10 minutes (a
  little longer if the filets are thick).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spicy Moroccan fish -- I got this recipe from a newspaper lying around a
  friend's house.  It is very spicy.  It will burn your mouth off.  Do not
  use on unsuspecting friends, unless you're trying to get rid of them.
  Yield: Makes 4 servings.
  
  *  You could substitute other types of fish.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

      Title: HOT SESAME SEED BEEF
 Categories: Meats, Stir-fry, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 T  Rice wine                         1/2 t  Baking powder
    1/2 t  Sugar                               5 t  Sesame oil
      2 t  Cornstarch                          5 t  Soy sauce

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      1 T  Sesame seeds                    1 1/2 t  Hoisin sauce
  1 1/2 t  Hot bean paste                  1 1/2 t  Oyster sauce

------------------------------------BEEF------------------------------------
      1 t  Minced ginger                       4    Lettuce leaves
    2/3 lb Beef tenderloin                          -(or less; use
           -flank                                   -bok-choy if you
           Peanut oil (2-4 T)                       -can get it)
 
  Mix together all of the marinade ingredients.  Slice the beef across the
  grain into thin, diagonal pieces (about the size of your smallest finger).
  Marinate for about half an hour.
  
  Heat the wok until a drop of water dropped into it dances around as it
  boils. Add enough oil to coat the wok and saute the ginger. Stir-fry the
  lettuce. Stir-fry the beef (in batches so the wok doesn't cool down too
  much).
  
  Reduce the heat.  Return the vegetables to the wok.  Add the topping.  Stir
  around until everything is mixed and heated evenly.  Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very hot, very simple, very good beef stir-fry -- This recipe has been
  floating around for years back east, where it's also known as Hot Flaming
  Death.
  
  *  Also add any other vegetables that you feel like.  Sliced carrots or
  broccoli are especially nice.
  
  *  Hot bean paste also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc.  This is
  the main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care. Vary this
  ingredient to taste.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  preparation:  20 minutes, cooking:  3 minutes.

      Title: DOG BISCUITS
 Categories: Critters, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
  3 1/2 C  Flour, all-purpose                       -(non-fat)
      2 C  Flour, whole-wheat                  4 t  Salt
      1 C  Flour, rye                          2 C  Chicken stock
      1 C  Cornmeal                          1/4 oz Dry yeast, active
      2 C  Cracked wheat                            -(one package)
           -(bulgur)                           1    Egg
    1/2 C  Dry milk powder                     1 T  Milk
 
  Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  Combine, in a big bowl, the flours,
  cornmeal, milk powder and salt.
  
  In a separate bowl, dissolve yeast in about 1/4 cup lukewarm water; let it
  sit for a few minutes, until it bubbles. Add the chicken stock to the yeast
  mixture.  Mix well.  Add the liquid to the dry ingredients.  Knead about 3
  minutes.  The dough should be stiff.
  
  Flour a board with cornmeal and roll out the dough to a thickness of about
  1/4 inch. Cut out biscuits with cookie cutters in appropriate shapes, and
  place on ungreased cookie sheets. Mix the egg and milk and use to brush
  tops of biscuits (for shine), then bake the biscuits for 45 minutes at 300
  degrees F.
  
  Turn off the heat and leave biscuits in the oven overnight.  This will make
  the biscuits be bone-hard.  Though these are intended for dogs, people find
  them better tasting than many health foods.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Homemade meatless dog biscuits -- This strange and wonderful recipe
  appeared in our hometown paper's consumer column, for making doggie
  Christmas presents! Although they are meatless, they are not vegetarian, as
  they contain chicken broth. However, your dog is quite unlikely to be a
  strict vegetarian. Yield: Several dozen.
  
  *  These make a dandy birthday or Christmas present for your favorite
  friend's dog.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking, overnight hardening.

      7 oz Amaretti                                 -(room temperature)
      4 oz Almond paste                        4 lg Eggs
    1/3 C  Amaretto liqueur                  1/2 C  Heavy cream
    1/4 C  Sugar, granulated
 
  MAKE CRUST:  Butter the sides only (not the bottom) of a 9-inch spring-form
  pan (about 2 1/2 to 3 inches deep).  Grind the Amaretti very fine in a food
  processor or blender.  Mix with sugar in a mixing bowl.
  
  Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler, stirring
  occasionally.  Add the melted mixture to the Amaretti crumbs and sugar and
  mix thoroughly. (Don't wash the double boiler; you'll be using it again in
  a minute.)
  
  Turn the mixture into the prepared pan.  With your fingers, distribute it
  evenly over the bottom and press it down into a very firm, compact layer.
  Refrigerate while you prepare the filling.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Adjust rack 1/3 up from the bottom of the oven and preheat
  to 350 degrees F. Partially melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler,
  then uncover and stir until completely melted. Remove the top of the double
  boiler and set aside to cool.
  
  Break the Amaretti coarsely into a bowl and set aside.  Cut the almond
  paste into small pieces, and beat on low speed with an electric mixer,
  while gradually adding the Amaretto liqueur. Beat until thoroughly mixed
  and set aside.
  
  Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add the sugar
  and beat until smooth again. Add the almond paste-Amaretto mixture and beat
  until thoroughly mixed. Add the melted chocolate and beat well again. Add
  the eggs one at a time, beating at low speed until they are incorporated
  after each addition. Add the heavy cream and beat until smooth. Add the
  coarsely broken Amaretti and stir gently only to mix.
  
  Turn into the prepared pan, pouring the mixture over the bottom crust.
  Rotate the pan gently to level the batter. (Don't worry if the mixture
  comes almost to the top; it won't run over.)
  
  Bake 45 minutes.  It will seem soft and not done, but don't bake any more;
  it will become firm when chilled. The top of the cake is supposed to look
  bumpy because of the large chunks of Amaretti. Let cool completely at room
  temperature, then carefully remove the sides of the pan and refrigerate the
  cake (still on the bottom of the pan) for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is adapted from Maida Heatter's "Book of Great Chocolate Desserts,"
  (Knopf 1980).  It won me a blue ribbon at the Martha's Vineyard
  Agricultural Exhibition and Fair in 1983. If you ever find yourself in
  front of a firing squad, this makes an unbeatable last request.
  
  *  Amaretti are Italian almond-flavored wafer cookies.  They are usually
  sold in metal tins with the wafers wrapped in packages of two inside the
  tin. You can also buy Amarettini, which are the same flavor but much
  smaller and not individually wrapped. Since you're going to grind some of
  the wafers and break the others into chunks, it doesn't matter which size
  you start with. One brand is Amaretti di Saronna, Lazzaroni & Co.
  
  *  This is an expensive cake, both in terms of the cost of the ingredients
  ($15-$20) and the number of calories.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking, overnight cooling.
  : Precision:  measure ingredients carefully.

      Title: DARK FRUITCAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 1 cake
 
     16 oz Citron, candied                     3 C  Flour (white)
           -(or candied fruit                  2 t  Baking powder
           -and peels)                         2 t  Salt
      8 oz Cherries, candied                   1 T  Cinnamon, ground
      1 C  Raisins, dark                       1 t  Nutmeg, ground
      1 C  Raisins, golden                     1 t  Allspice, ground
  1 1/3 C  Calmyra figs, cut                   1 t  Cloves, ground
           -into pieces                        4    Eggs
  1 1/3 C  Dates (pitted), cut             1 3/4 C  Brown sugar, packed
           -into small slices                  1 C  Orange juice
  1 1/2 C  Pecan halves                      3/4 C  Butter, melted
           -(or walnut halves                       -(cooled)
           -if necessary)                    1/4 C  Molasses, light
    1/2 C  Brandy                                   -(treacle)
 
  Mix fruits together in a bowl.  Pour brandy over fruits.  Turn fruit
  mixture over every 20 minutes. Soaking time is a matter of taste, but two
  hours is typical. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Prepare tube pan: grease
  sides and bottom. Line bottom and sides with greased brown paper.
  
  In a very large bowl, mix flour, spices, baking powder and salt.  Stir
  until spices are evenly blended throughout.
  
  In a third bowl beat eggs until fluffy.  Add brown sugar, orange juice,
  molasses and butter.  Mix, making sure that all the sugar dissolves.
  
  Pour off any liquid from fruit mixture and add the fruit and the nuts to
  the dry ingredients. Mix until all fruit pieces are coated. Then pour in
  the liquids and mix gently until you have an evenly-mixed batter.
  
  Pour batter into pan and bake at 300 degrees F. for 1 hour.  Cover pan with
  foil and bake for 1 hour more or until toothpick inserted in center comes
  out clean. Cool for 30 minutes before removing from pan. Peel off paper
  very carefully.
  
  Put cake in cake tin lined with foil.  For the next 3 to 4 weeks, sprinkle
  a little brandy over cake twice a week. Keep cake covered and store the tin
  in the refrigerator. If you prefer to omit the brandy, cover top of cake
  with very thin slices of apple instead.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An extravagant, traditional fruitcake -- This is about as rich a
  fruitcake as you could possibly want to make. It started life as a Better
  Homes and Gardens recipe, but has been changed beyond all recognition.
  Yield:  a 7 lb cake.
  
  *  This makes a HUGE cake.  If your tube pan isn't at least 10 X 4 inches,
  there is a fair chance that it will run over; in that case, use several
  loaf pans instead (fill loaf pans about half-way). A pan with a
  removable center will make extracting the cake much easier.
  
  *  Except for mixing the liquids, an electric beater is useless for this
  recipe.
  
  *  In the USA, candied fruits typically come in packages of the indicated
  sizes.  If you have to measure by volume, use 2 1/2 cups of candied citron
  and 1 1/3 cups of the candied cherries. I prefer citron instead of the
  mixture because there's no bitterness from the rinds, although the cake
  isn't so colorful. Calmyra figs are the light-colored figs most commonly
  seen in North America.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  2 hours preparation (including soaking the fruit), 2 hours baking,
  several weeks mellowing.
  : Precision:  Measure batter ingredients carefully.  Fruit and nut
  quantities are somewhat flexible.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 pk Manicotti                                -(12 or so shells)

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      2 lb Tomatoes, crushed                   1 T  Basil
           -(1 large can)                      1 T  Oregano
      2 lb Tomatoes, whole                   1/2 t  Tarragon
           -(1 large can)                    1/4 t  Thyme
      4 T  Tomato paste                      1/4 t  Rosemary
      6    Garlic cloves                     1/4 t  Red pepper flakes
           -(or less)                               Cayenne pepper,
      2 C  Onions, chopped                          -to taste
    1/2 C  Olive oil                           1 t  Parsley, preferably fresh,
    1/2 t  Black pepper                             -but dry will do
      2    Bay leaves                          1 ds Red wine, dry

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
    1/2 C  Parsley, chopped                  1/2 C  Parmesan cheese, grated
      1 lb Ricotta                           1/2 C  Romano cheese, grated
      2    Eggs                              1/2 t  Black pepper
      1 C  Mozzarella, shredded                1    Garlic clove, crushed
 
  MAKE SAUCE:  Saute onions in large pot with olive oil over medium heat. Add
  crushed garlic.  Cook until onions start to brown.  Add cans of tomatoes
  along with paste, breaking any large chunks. Add in seasonings and red
  wine. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20-30 minutes.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  mix filling ingredients in bowl, reserving about 1/2 cup of
  the shredded mozzarella to sprinkle on top.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cook manicotti until they are al dente
  (follow the instructions on the box). Drain and stuff each with filling
  mixture. Cover baking pan with about 1/2 inch of sauce, and arrange stuffed
  shells on top. Cover with sauce and reserved mozzarella. Bake at 350
  degrees F. for about 20 minutes, until cheese is nicely browned and sauce
  is bubbling.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is my (American) recipe for stuffed manicotti shells.  Perhaps it's
  not authentic, but it's tasty.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  While I prefer to use true manicotti, regular pasta shells are easier to
  stuff and it's okay to substitute.  You can also cut each manicotti down
  one side and rewrap it around the stuffing. This freezes well uncooked;
  cover with plastic wrap and foil. Let it defrost in a 200 95 oven for an
  hour or overnight in the refrigerator. The cheese mixture can be modified
  to suit your tastes. Cottage cheese can be substituted for the ricotta.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

    1/2 C  Butter (or margarine)               3 T  Milk
    1/4 C  Sugar, white                        2 T  Vanilla custard powder
      1    Egg                                      -(or pudding powder)
      4 T  Cocoa                               2 C  Icing sugar, sifted
      2 C  Graham wafer crumbs                 4    Chocolate squares
      1 C  Coconut                                  -(semisweet)
    1/2 C  Nuts, chopped                       1 t  Butter
    1/4 C  Butter                         
 
  Mix the 1/2 cup butter, white sugar, egg and cocoa.  Set over boiling water
  and stir until mixture resembles a custard.  Combine crumbs, coconut and
  nuts. Combine with the butter/sugar mixture, blending well. Spread and
  press tightly into a 9 x 9 inch pan.
  
  Cream the 1/4 cup butter, milk, custard powder and icing sugar.  Spread
  over mixture in pan. Melt the chocolate over hot water; add butter and
  blend well. Spread over the icing. Let set. Chill and keep refrigerated.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Favorite Canadian sweet -- This comes from a page in an obscure
  magazine called something like "Canadian Homemaker_, by way of a Canadian
  friend, Steve Deering. This is a traditional Canadian sweet, much loved and
  admired. The origin of the recipe seems to be lost in the mists of time,
  though everyone seems to agree that it comes from the town of Nanaimo, in
  British Columbia.

      Title: NAINAIMO BARS II
 Categories: Desserts, Canadian, Usenet
      Yield: 20 bars
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
    1/2 C  Butter                              1 t  Vanilla
    1/4 C  Sugar, granulated               1 2/3 C  Graham wafer crumbs, fine
      5 T  Cocoa                               1 C  Coconut, desiccated
      1    Egg                               1/2 C  Walnuts, chopped

-------------------------------CREAMY CENTER-------------------------------
    1/4 C  Butter                              1    Egg
      2 C  Icing sugar, sifted           

-----------------------------CHOCOLATE TOPPING-----------------------------
      4 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet               1 T  Butter
 
  MAKE CRUST:  Grease a 9-inch square cake pan.  In a sauce pan combine the
  butter, sugar, cocoa, egg and vanilla.  Cook over medium heat stirring
  constantly, until smooth and slightly thickened.  Stir in the remaining
  crust ingredients and press into prepared pan.
  
  Make the creamy center:  cream the butter and gradually beat in icing sugar
  and egg.  Spread over crumb mixture and chill for about 15 minutes.
  
  Make the chocolate topping:  melt the chocolate and butter together over
  hot water or in a microwave, being careful not to burn. Spread on top of
  the previous parts. Chill until set. Cut into squares with a sharp knife.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  No-bake, 3-layer (chocolate covered) bars -- Nanaimo bars are a
  traditional Canadian dessert, though nobody is certain where the tradition
  came from. Laura Secord is a Canadian candy company; their cook book says
  this about the origin of these fattening delicacies:
  
  "A version of these no-bake bars developed in the Canadian kitchens of a
  well-known food company, was christened by them Nanaimo bars after the city
  of that name on Vancouver Island. Nanaimo (from sne-ny-mo, a local Indian
  term for a loose confederation of five bands) started as a Hudson Bay
  Trading Post in 1849."

      Title: SWEDISH MEATBALLS
 Categories: Meats, Appetizers, Swedish, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 C  Bread crumbs                        1 lb Meat, ground
    1/2 C  Milk                                     -(mixture of beef
      1 sm Onion                                    -and pork)
      1    Egg                                      Salt and pepper
 
  Mix bread crumbs and milk.  Let it swell for about 10 minutes.  Mince the
  onion and fry it until soft.  Mix all the ingredients.
  
  Form into small balls with your hands.  This is easier to do with wet
  hands. The size of the balls can vary a little, but a cherry is too small
  and a ping-pong ball is too big.
  
  Fry the balls in butter in a frying pan (medium hot) for about 5 minutes.
  Turn them around to get them fried on all sides.  The balls get dark brown.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A traditional Swedish recipe -- It is served at the smorgasbord and also
  at Christmas in Swedish homes (as one of many dishes). It can also be
  served with brown sauce, potatoes and lingonberry jam at lunch or dinner.
  Kids love the meatballs with pasta.
  
  *  It's a little bit tricky to get the balls round.  Don't put all the
  meatballs in the frying pan at once.

           -(or less)                     
 
  Chop the onion finely.  Peel the potatoes and cut them in strips.  Chop the
  anchovy.  Put potatoes, onion and anchovy in layers in a greased pan.  Make
  sure that the top layer has only potatoes showing.  Pour the cream over it.
  Sprinkle on some bread crumbs and some pats of butter.  Bake in oven for
  about 40 minutes at 400 degrees F. until the potatoes are soft.
  
  If you are the "Jane Fonda" type, you can mix milk and cream, instead of
  only cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A kind of gratin with potatoes -- This is one of the dishes at a real
  Swedish smorgasbord.  It is often served with beer and salad as a night
  meal at parties.
  
  *  Jansson is the family name of the person who invented this dish.  Every
  Swede knows about Jansson's Temptation, but nobody knows just who Jansson
  was.

      Title: TORTILLA SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Mexican, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     12    Corn tortillas                           Mozzarella cheese,
      2 C  Tomato sauce                             -chopped
           -(2 standard cans)                       Avocado, chopped
    1/4 C  Onion, chopped                           Oil for frying
           Pork rinds, crushed             
 
  Cut the tortillas into strips (about 1 inch wide).  Fry the tortillas in
  the oil until golden brown and crispy. Dry them in a paper towel and add a
  little salt.
  
  To make the soup:  In a medium kettle saute the onions in a bit of oil
  until they become translucent. Mix about 2 cups of water with the tomato
  sauce and bring to a boil. Set aside. Add salt and pepper to taste.
  
  To serve:  pour the soup into 4 soup bowls.  Put some tortilla strips in
  each bowl. Bring them to the table along with the cheese, pork rinds and
  avocado. Each person adds the rest to his/her soup to their taste. You can
  add some tabasco sauce to the soup to make it hot or use any cheese that
  will melt when added to the soup.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A soup with crispy tortillas -- This is my recipe for a soup that is
  very popular in Mexico. If you have ever wondered what to do with some
  leftover tortillas that are in your refrigerator, then read this recipe. If
  you haven't wondered, then do it with fresh tortillas.
  
  *  Pork rinds are a typical Mexican snack that is sold in many supermarkets
  in bulk or in the snack area.

      1 lb Tomatoes (canned),                       -coarsely chopped
           -whole, peeled (do not                   Salt
           -drain; reserve the liquid)         1 C  Rice, cooked (cook about
      1    Onion, cut into                          -3 oz of raw rice to get
           -1/2-inch pieces                         -that much cooked rice)
      1    Green pepper, cut into              2 t  Parsley, minced
           -1/2-inch pieces                    4 oz Tortilla chips
      3    Sprigs fresh cilantro             1/2 lb Cheddar cheese, grated
    1/2 t  Cumin, ground                  
 
  Combine chicken and water in stockpot.  Add celery seed, peppercorns and
  garlic tied in cheesecloth.  Cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer
  for about 45 minutes.  Remove chicken from broth and let cool.
  
  Strain broth and return to pot.  Add tomatoes, onion, green pepper,
  cilantro, cumin, cayenne, white pepper and garlic. Cover and simmer 30
  minutes.
  
  Add corn and green onion.  Simmer 10 minutes.  While this is cooking, skin
  and bone the chicken pieces and cut the meat into bite-size pieces. Add
  salt to taste. Add the chicken, rice and parsley to the broth, and heat
  through.
  
  Garnish each bowl with a few crisp tortilla chips (homemade are best, or
  those made in a homemade style) and some grated cheddar cheese.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spicy soup with cheese, tomatoes and corn -- This is a recipe from
  Salmagundi, a San Francisco soup restaurant chain.
  
  *  I usually make this with leftover chicken.  You don't actually need a
  whole chicken worth, even a small amount will do. In this case, I use a
  mixture of chicken broth and water (about 2/3 chicken broth) for the
  liquid.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  2 hours, most of it simmering.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

    3/4 C  Butter                                   Juice of 1/2 lemon
      1 T  Garlic, finely minced               1 t  Basil, dry
      1 C  Clam juice                        1/4 t  Nutmeg
    1/4 C  Flour                                    Salt and peper
      1 T  Parsley, minced                   1/2 C  Half-and-half
    1/3 C  White wine                               -(or use light cream)

-----------------------------------SCAMPI-----------------------------------
      2 T  Butter                              1 T  Basil, fresh
    1/3 C  Olive oil                         1/4 C  White wine
      1 T  Garlic, minced                      1 ds Vermouth, dry
           Juice of 1 lemon                         Salt and pepper
      1 T  Parsley, chopped                    3 lb Shrimp, deveined
    1/2 t  Red pepper, crushed            
 
  MAKE SAUCE:  Melt butter with garlic in saucepan over medium heat; do not
  let the garlic brown.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix clam juice, flour and parsley, blending until
  mixture is smooth. Pour flour mixture into garlic butter and stir until
  smooth and well blended. Stir in wine, lemon juice, herbs and spices,
  stirring constantly. Gradually add half-and-half and stir until thickened.
  Simmer for 30 to 45 minutes.
  
  MAKE SCAMPI:  Melt butter in large saucepan on high heat and add oil.
  Combine remaining ingredients keeping scampi aside until the last minute.
  Add scampi and saute until firm and slightly pink. Do not overcook. Pour
  scampi butter over scampi.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  I serve this over fettucini (1 1/2 lbs for a full batch).  To save the
  trouble of de-veining shellfish, you can have two or three big ones for
  each person, and use small bay shrimp for the remainder.
  
  *  This recipe comes from the "Garlic Lovers' Cookbook," published by the
  Gilroy Garlic Festival, P.O.  Box 2311, Gilroy, California, USA.  North
  America mail order price is $9.45 (paperback) or $12.45 (spiral) for each
  of the 2 volumes.
  
  : Difficulty:  Moderate.
  : Time:  45 minutes cooking, 1 1/2 hours for de-veining scampi, 10 minutes
  for other preparation.

      Title: TOO MUCH FRUIT SALAD
 Categories: Fruit, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1    Pineapple, ripe                     1 lb Stewed prunes,
      1    Melon, ripe                              -in heavy syrup
      1 lg Grapefruit                               -(1 standard can)
           -(preferably pink)                  3    Peaches, sliced
      3    Oranges                                  -(or use 1 lb stewed
     11 oz Maraschino cherries                      -apricot halves in
           -(1 large jar)                           -heavy syrup)
      3    Bananas, ripe                       1 C  Apricot nectar
      3    Kiwi fruits                    
 
  Peel and section the grapefruit and oranges.  Remove the seeds and
  membranes. Cut the sections into bite-size pieces and dump into a big
  non-metallic bowl.
  
  Peel and core the pineapple (making sure to get all the eyes), cut the
  flesh into bite-sized pieces and add to the bowl. A typical whole pineapple
  is usually too much, so you might want to reserve about 1/3 of the flesh to
  eat by itself.
  
  Peel and cut the melon, bananas, peaches and kiwi fruits and add to the
  bowl. The kiwis should be sliced horizontally (so the seeds make pretty
  circular patterns).
  
  Add the stewed prunes, syrup and all.  This will moisten everything.  Add
  the maraschino cherries and the syrup they came in (check for stems). Add
  the nectar, making sure there is enough liquid to cover the fruit.
  
  This is the hard part.  Put it all in the refrigerator, and don't eat any
  until tomorrow.  It really needs to sit overnight for all the colors and
  flavors to blend together.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Many people think of fruit salad as that disgusting stuff that comes in
  a can made from diced plastic fruit and heavy syrup. This is more like what
  it is supposed to taste like, although some people might claim that my
  addition of syrup makes this into fruit cocktail instead of fruit salad.
  
  Whatever you call it, it's especially good in the summer.  I make it every
  couple of months (usually in vast quantities, even though there are only
  two of us, hence the name). It rarely lasts very long, regardless of how
  much I make. Yield: Makes too much.
  
  *  Some people might object to the use of maraschino cherries, they are
  processed with sulfur dioxide, which isn't really good for you.  I like the
  way they taste, so I allow myself this one debauch.
  
  *  Unless you can find good-quality fresh fruit, it is better to use
  canned. This is especially true of pineapple, canned pineapple is not as
  good as good fresh pineapple, but is much better than a bad fresh one. For
  the melon, I've used honeydew, cantaloupe and casaba with good results.
  Watermelon is interesting, but has a very different texture from the
  others.  More important than the actual variety is that it is ripe.
  Unfortunately, New York supermarkets only seem to sell the kind of melon
  that goes from rock-hard to rotten without passing through ripe. Bananas
  are best when they are just starting to get brown speckles.
  
  *  My mother uses orange juice for the liquid, but I prefer nectar.  The
  combination of the prune and cherry syrups give it a nice color. Sometimes
  I add a bit of lemon juice for tartness. I've experimented with cherry
  liqueur, but didn't really like the results.
  
  *  Use whatever fruit you find fresh in the market.  The invariant part is
  the grapefruit, orange and maraschino cherries.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1/2 day waiting.

      Title: CURRIED FRUIT
 Categories: Fruit, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      5 lb Fruit (pears, peaches,              3 t  Curry powder
           -pineapple, apricot, etc.)        1/3 C  Butter, melted
     12    Cherries                          3/4 C  Almonds (blanched),
    3/4 C  Light brown sugar                        -slivered
 
  Add sugar and curry powder to melted butter and mix well.  Drain all fruit
  well.  Arrange fruit and nuts in layers in casserole dish.  There should be
  enough fruit to fill the dish about three-quarters full.  Pour butter
  mixture over fruit.
  
  Bake at 325 degrees F. for one hour.    Refrigerate overnight.  Reheat at
  350 degrees F. until hot before serving (about 10-15 minutes).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Baked fruit with curry sauce and nuts -- This dish can be served as a
  desert, alone, or on top of ice cream or pound cake (or both!).  But, our
  favorite way of serving it is as a side dish at brunch on Christmas day. As
  long as I can remember, Mom has had this dish, along with an egg/cheese
  casserole, bacon and muffins for Christmas brunch.  It is especially easy
  since you make it a day ahead of time.  Yield:  Serves 8-12.
  
  *  I use standard American "curry powder".  Any other that you want to use
  should be ok.  Adjust the amount of curry powder to your taste, or use
  cinnamon if you really don't like the flavor of curry.
  
  Use your imagination in choosing the fruits to go in it.  Cherries and
  almonds are a must, but the rest is up to you. We use canned fruit, but
  fresh would be good too.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking, overnight cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHOCOLATE NUT CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, No-bake, Usenet
      Yield: 1 cake
 
    1/4 lb Butter (or margarine)           2 1/2 t  Cocoa
      1 C  Icing sugar                       1/2 lb Graham crackers
      2 lg Eggs                                     Milk
    3/4 C  Cashews or almonds                3/4 t  Vanilla
 
  Cream together the butter and sugar.  Chop the nuts and roast if desired.
  
  Soak the crackers in the milk until they are soft but have not turned to
  mush. Dissolve cocoa in about 2 T milk, and add this and the nuts to the
  creamed butter/sugar mixture.
  
  Separate the eggs and set the whites aside.  To the creamed mixture add the
  yolks and  vanilla and beat.  Whip the whites until stiff peaks form, then
  fold this into the mixture.
  
  Line a 9-inch square pan with a layer of crackers, mixture, and crackers.
  Top with the remaining mixture and set in the refrigerator until hard.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A no-bake graham-cracker chocolate cake -- This is a delicious,
  easy-to-make cake that everyone enjoys.  It came from an East Indian friend
  of mine who said it had been in the family. It seems western so I am
  uncertain of its origins.
  
  *  Depending on how you want the texture of the cake you can soak the
  crackers until they are slightly softened or until they fall apart.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.

      Title: CHINESE SPAGHETTI
 Categories: Pasta, Chinese, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Bean sprouts                        1 T  Sesame seed oil
      2 T  Peas (fresh or frozen)            1/2 C  Chicken broth
           -per person                         5 T  Sweet bean sauce
      1    Cucumber                                 -(or hoisin sauce)
      3    Eggs                                3 T  Soy sauce
    1/2 C  Green onions, chopped               1 T  Chinese rice wine
      1 C  Chinese noodles (or             1 1/2 t  Sugar (omit if hoisin
           -linguine) per person                    -sauce was used)
      1 lb Lean pork or beef,                1/2 t  MSG
           -chopped into small pieces          1 T  Green onion, finely
      1 t  Ginger, crushed                          -chopped
 
  TO PREPARE THE MEAT SAUCE:  Heat about 3 T oil in wok, brown the ginger and
  green onion, then add meat and brown together.
  
  Mix together the bean (or hoisin) and soy sauces, add this mixture to the
  meat, and stir fry briefly.  Then add rice wine, sugar, MSG and sesame oil.
  Add the chicken broth and simmer for about 3 minutes, until the sauce
  becomes thick and shiny. Put mixture in a serving bowl and set aside.
  
  (GARNISHES)
  
  :  o  Boil bean sprouts for 1 minute, drain, and put in serving bowl.
  :  o  Warm peas and put in a serving bowl.
  :  o  Cut cucumber into very fine strips, or grate.  Place in serving bowl.
  :  o  Scramble eggs, fry into very thin pancakes, and cut into thin strips.
  
  TO SERVE:  Cook noodles in boiling water for 3 minutes; drain.  If you are
  preparing this dish ahead, rinse with cold water, drain, and add about 1 T
  sesame seed oil and mix well.
  
  Serve about 1 cup hot or cold noodles in a bowl, then add the garnishes and
  meat sauce to taste.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  The original Chinese spaghetti -- This recipe is an interesting
  variation from the usual restaurant chinese food. When I learned this dish,
  I realized that this was the origin of the Italian pasta dishes. It still
  serves as a reminder that there is a huge variety of Northern Chinese
  dishes that use wheat-based starches instead of rice. Yield: serves 6-8.
  
  *  This dish can be prepared a day ahead and served cold.  The selection of
  vegetables in the garnish is pretty arbitrary.  All kinds of vegetable
  combinations are good.  The only rule is that they should all be cut into
  thin strips.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  1-2 hours (lots of preparation, little cooking).
  : Precision:  Measure the sauce ingredients.

      Title: CAJUN LAMB WITH RICE
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Boneless lamb sirloin               1 lb Tomatoes, sliced,
           -roast (approx. 2 lbs)                   -in puree
      2 T  Cooking oil                     1 1/2 C  Chicken stock
      1 sm Onion, chopped                    1/2 t  Basil
      1    Red bell pepper,                  1/2 t  Grated lemon peel
           -diced                            1/2 t  Chili powder
      1    Green bell pepper,                  1 C  Rice
           -diced                        

---------------------------------SPICE MIX---------------------------------
      1 t  Salt                              1/4 t  Paprika
    1/2 t  Cayenne pepper                    1/8 t  Garlic powder
    1/4 t  Black pepper                   
 
  Trim the lamb of any excess fat.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix
  together the spice mix ingredients, and rub over the lamb. Let stand for 15
  minutes. Heat oil in a skillet. Sear the lamb until all sides are browned.
  Remove lamb to a roasting pan. Roast lamb for 35 to 40 minutes.
  
  While the lamb is cooking, add onions and peppers to the skillet used for
  searing the lamb.  Saute until soft.  Add tomatoes, chicken stock, basil,
  lemon and chili powder.  Bring to a boil and add the rice.  Reduce heat and
  simmer until liquid is absorbed.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is a spicy lamb dish that I picked up originally from a local
  newspaper.  Yield:  serves 2-3.
  
  *  Often when boning a leg of lamb you end up with a very ragged piece of
  meat.  Just chop it up into boxy pieces and use more spice mix to cover all
  the surfaces.  You will be slicing up the roast before serving anyhow.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

      Title: AUTUMN FRUIT CORNISH HENS
 Categories: Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8    Cornish game hens                   1 C  Prunes, pitted
           -(each about 1 lb)                  1 C  Apricots, dried
     12 lg Garlic cloves, peeled               1 C  Green olives, pitted
           -and finely minced                1/2 C  Capers (plus a bit
      4 T  Oregano, dried                           -of the juice)
           Salt (to taste)                     8    Bay leaves
           Pepper (to taste)                   1 C  Brown sugar
      1 C  Red wine vinegar                    1 C  White wine, dry
    1/2 C  Olive oil                           4 T  Italian parsley (chopped)
 
  Clean hens well under cold water.  Pat dry.
  
  In a large bowl, combine hens, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, vinegar, oil,
  prunes, apricots, olives, capers (with juice) and bay leaves.  Cover and
  refrigerate overnight to marinate.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Arrange game hens in 1 or 2 shallow
  roasting pans. Spoon all the marinade over the hens. Sprinkle evenly with
  brown sugar and pour wine around them. Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, basting
  frequently, until golden. Juice should look clear when thigh is pricked
  with a fork. Transfer hens, fruit, olives and capers to a serving platter.
  Moisten with pan juices and sprinkle with parsley. Pass remaining pan
  juices in a sauce boat.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cornish game hens stewed in fruit and sugar -- I originally got this
  recipe from the Sunday magazine of the local paper. I served it last year
  for Christmas dinner, and it's very good. What's more, this recipe is easy:
  you just put everything in a bowl, marinate overnight, then bake until
  done!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: FLAN
 Categories: Desserts, Mexican, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 C  Sugar                               2 C  Milk
      2    Eggs                                1 t  Vanilla extract
      2    Egg yolks                      
 
  In a small kettle, heat about 3 T of sugar with about 1 t of water until
  the mixture turns brown. Pour the mixture into 4 gelatin molds. Move the
  molds around so that the mixture coats the interior. Set aside.
  
  Mix the eggs, sugar, milk and the vanilla extract.  Pour the mixture into
  the molds. Put the molds over a deep pan with water (double boiler or bain
  marie technique) for 1 hr in a 350 degree F. oven. Keep the water in the
  pan at the same level by adding boiling water. Cool and put it in the
  refrigerator. Unmold the flan before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich Mexican custard -- This recipe comes from the "Delicias
  Culinarias" cookbook that I brought from Mexico.
  
  *  You can substitute liquor for some of the milk to make the flan richer.
  Personally, I use about 1 cup of milk and about 1 cup rompope (Mexican
  eggnog).
  
  *  Be careful when coating glass molds as they can break because of the
  sudden change in temperatures. You have to do it fast as the mixture
  hardens very quickly.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  2 1/2 hours

      Title: BREAKFAST PANCAKES
 Categories: Breakfast, Usenet
      Yield: 8 pancakes
 
  1 1/2 C  Flour, all-purpose                1/4 t  Vanilla essence
      1 t  Salt                                2    Eggs
      3 T  Sugar                               3 T  Butter, melted
  1 3/4 t  Baking powder                      10 oz Milk
 
  Put a frying pan on a low to medium heat and melt the butter.  Whilst the
  butter is melting, measure the flour and sift into a large mixing bowl. Add
  the salt, sugar and baking powder.
  
  Measure the milk in a measuring jug.  Separate the eggs and place the
  whites in a cup, adding the yolks to the milk. Add the melted butter from
  the frying pan. Remove as much from the pan as you can, but don't be too
  particular. The remaining butter in the frying pan will be used to cook the
  pancakes in. I use a rubber spatula to get most of it off the pan. Leave
  the ring on, but don't put the pan back on it. (I have an electric cooker
  which takes a long time to heat up). In this way you can start cooking the
  pancakes as soon as the batter is ready.
  
  When the butter has coagulated, add the liquid mixture to the dry
  ingredients and mix them up. I use a metal spoon. It is at this stage you
  can judge whether the mixture has the right consistency.
  
  Wash the measuring jug and dry it thoroughly.  Pour the egg whites into it
  and whisk with an electric hand-held whisk. I whisk them until they are
  quite hard. (If there are lumps in the batter, you can user the whisk to
  get rid of them.) Using the spatula (from the butter, right?), transfer all
  the egg whites into the big bowl. Fold the egg whites into the batter with
  the metal spoon until they are all incorporated. The batter is now ready.
  
  Put the frying pan back on the heat and wait until it is to a reasonable
  temperature.  I can't be more specific because it depends on your cooker
  and the frying pan that you are using. Make the pancakes one at a time,
  turning them over when the underside is cooked. Eat immediately with butter
  and maple syrup.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Light and fluffy breakfast pancakes -- The formula comes from "The Joy
  of Cooking" by Irma S. Rombauer and Marion Rombauer Becker. I bought the
  book when I was visiting California a few years back. The pancakes are to
  my liking, but my wife has had to endure vast quantities of failures before
  I got the right technique. These pancakes are amazing for their stupefying
  ability. No more than three can be eaten in one day. A slow and painful
  death will result from exceeding these guidelines. Yield: 8-10 6-inch
  pancakes.
  
  *  The order that I do things is the result of much experimentation.  I
  have a Creda Cavalier and use a Fissler German-made corrugated-bottom
  frying pan. With this combination I set the ring to 2.75-3.0.
  
  One way to test is to place a small dollop of batter in the frying pan.  It
  should take about 1-2 minutes to brown.  As the underside is browning,
  bubbles should be forming on the top surface. The consistency of the batter
  and the temperature of cooking are correct when the bubbles fail to burst
  when the underside is fully cooked.
  
  *  Now that I know what I'm doing, they're easy, but I had a awful lot of
  failures to start with.  Don't expect success the first time.  You won't be
  disappointed.  The effort is worth it in the long run.  What is important
  is to get the moisture content of the batter correct. If it is too sloppy;
  then the pancakes will be flat and stodgy. If the batter is too dry; then
  the pancakes will burn before they are cooked.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate until you learn the technique.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: CHERRY CREAM CHEESE PIE
 Categories: Pies, Usenet
      Yield: 1 pie
 
      1    Pie shell                         1/2 t  Vanilla (or to taste)
           -(graham cracker)                   4 oz Whipped cream
      8 oz Cream cheese                       14 oz Cherry pie filling
    1/2 C  Sour cream                               -(1 can)
    1/3 C  Granulated sugar               
 
  Cream together the cheese and sour cream.  Fold in sugar gradually.  Add
  vanilla and mix well.  Fold in whipped cream.  Pour into pie shell and
  chill for at least 3 hours.
  
  Pour excess syrup from the can of cherry pie filling.  Leave some, but you
  certainly don't need all of it.  The sauce should cover the cream cheese
  mix, but the cherries shouldn't be drowning in it. Pour pie filling on top.
  Serve cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple cherry cream cheese pie -- My wife makes this for me
  periodically, and it is always delicious. No baking is required, and it is
  very easy to make. Yield: Makes one pie.
  
  *  If you don't have the time to sit around for 3 hours waiting for the pie
  to chill, make the cream cheese filling the night before and let the pie
  chill overnight.
  
  *  We prefer to use non-dairy whipped cream substitute.  We usually use the
  same brand name ingredients for best results:  Philadelphia cream cheese,
  Breakstone's sour cream, Cool-whip and Comstock cherry pie filling.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK, especially with the vanilla.

      Title: SPINACH CHEESE CASSEROLE IN PUFF PASTRY
 Categories: Casseroles, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     10 oz Spinach, chopped                  1/4 C  Scallions, chopped
           -(fresh or frozen)                  4 lg Eggs
      1 C  Cottage OR                          2 T  Butter
           -ricotta cheese                     1 pn Salt
      1 C  Feta cheese                         1 pn Pepper
           -(crumbled and drained             12 oz Puff pastry
           -of any brine)                           -(frozen pastry thawed
    1/4 C  Parmesan or romano                       -to room temperature,
           -cheese, grated                          -or homemade)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cook the spinach in boiling water.  Drain,
  rinse with cool water, and squeeze out as much moisture as you can.
  
  Melt the butter in a small skillet.  Cook the scallions until slightly
  soft.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine the cheeses and the eggs.  Mix well.  Add
  the spinach, the butter and scallions, the salt and pepper and mix again.
  
  Lightly butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking dish.  Roll
  out a sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface to make a 14-inch square.
  Roll out a second sheet to make a 9-inch square. Lay the bigger pastry
  sheet in the buttered dish, draping the extra pastry over the edges.
  
  Spread the spinach and cheese mixture evenly in the dish.  Put the
  remaining pastry sheet on top. Trim excess pastry if necessary and seal the
  edges closed. Use scraps of pastry dough to decorate the top of the pie.
  Brush top with additional melted butter if desired. Bake for 45 minutes at
  350 degrees F. or until pastry is golden brown. Let rest for 10 minutes
  before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spinach and cheeses in a puff pastry crust -- A recipe of this type
  appeared in _Cuisine Magazine_.  The dish is hearty enough to be a main
  course, but can also be a side dish to a meat entree.  Yield:  Serves 4 to
  6.
  
  *  The casserole may be prepared, covered and refrigerated for up to 8
  hours.
  
  *  As an alternative to puff pastry, you might try using sheets of filo
  dough, overlapped to make the bottom and top crusts. I have also baked this
  dish in a pie pan using filo dough. One way to cut down on the calories in
  this dish is to omit the bottom crust entirely. This is a very flexible
  recipe. Other vegetables can be substituted for the spinach, and other
  ingredients like sauteed garlic and mushrooms can be added.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      1    Broccoli bunch                 
 
  Saute the diced vegetables in butter.  Mix flour and mustard into sauted
  vegetables.  Add the chicken or vegetable stock to mixture and cook for
  five minutes.
  
  Break broccoli into small florets; cut stems into bite-sizes pieces.  Steam
  until tender-crisp.
  
  Add beer and cheeses to the soup.  Simmer 10-15 minutes.  Check seasonings.
  To serve, place some broccoli into a soup bowl and ladle the soup over it.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An easy quick tummy-warming soup -- One of my favorite cold-weather
  soups, this recipe came from a friend of a friend of a friend. The listed
  vegetables are really just suggestions. Use whatever suits your fancy, or
  is in the refrigerator.
  
  *  Because of the cheese, this soup doesn't survive a night in the
  refrigerator very well.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
     10 oz Spinach, chopped                    3 T  Flour
           -(frozen or fresh)              1 1/4 C  Milk (we substitute
      3 sl Bacon                                    -a like quantity of
      1 sm Onion                                    -50/50 Kosher Parve
      1 t  Salt                                     -creamer and water)
    1/2 t  Pepper            
 
  Rinse and chop the spinach.  Place the chopped spinach in a heavy skillet,
  cover, and steam until wilted, stirring occasionally.  There is no need to
  add water other than what clings to the leaves from washing. (If you are
  using frozen spinach, place over low or medium heat to thaw and allow
  excess water to evaporate) Transfer to small bowl and squeeze completely
  dry.
  
  Grind bacon and onion very fine and place in saucepan.  Saute bacon and
  onion until bacon is cooked. Stir in flour to make smooth paste. Gradually
  add milk. Bring to boil and simmer 10 minutes over low heat until
  thickened.
  
  Add salt and pepper.  Grind spinach fine and add to cream sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Creamed spinach with bacon -- This is a creamed spinach recipe that we
  found in the _Los Angeles Times_.  It produces a creamed spinach that even
  my wife likes.
  
  *  You may find that you want to add extra milk and give the finished soup
  a final heating in the microwave. We did, and it didn't hurt it one bit.

      7 oz Chocolate, semisweet              1/4 t  Cream of tartar
      2 oz Chocolate, bitter                 3/4 C  Cornstarch, sifted

----------------------------------FROSTING----------------------------------
      2 t  Espresso coffee,                    2 oz Chocolate, bitter
           -instant                            2 T  Butter
      7 oz Chocolate, semisweet           
 
  Combine espresso, hot water, semisweet chocolate and bitter chocolate in
  double boiler filled with hot water and cover.  Without applying additional
  heat, melt the chocolate.
  
  Butter two layer-cake pans, lay a sheet of waxed paper in each, and dust
  the pans with flour. (The pans should be able to hold about 4 cups each.)
  
  Beat the egg yolks and then gradually add about 2/3 cup of sugar until the
  yolks are thick and lemon colored.
  
  Beat butter into the chocolate mixture.  Add the chocolate mixture to the
  egg yolks and stir.
  
  Beat the egg whites until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar, and then
  gradually add up to 2 T sugar.
  
  Add the sifted corn starch gradually to the chocolate mixture, alternating
  with the egg whites.  The corn starch and egg whites should be folded in to
  the chocolate mixture.
  
  Pour half the batter into each cake pan.  Bake on the lower middle level of
  a preheated 350 degree F. oven until set on the sides. Cool the cake in the
  pan, and then turn out onto a serving dish.
  
  Combine the icing ingredients and ice the cake as you would a normal layer
  cake.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A decadently rich chocolate cake -- My mother got this recipe from a
  radio show about ten years ago. She was intrigued because the cake contains
  no flour. It is definitely for chocoholics. Although it is a two-layer
  cake, it is only about 3-4 inches thick when it's done, and has the
  consistency and density of a chocolate candy bar. It can be frozen if you
  find it too much to eat at one time.

      Title: BLENDER MAYONNAISE
 Categories: Condiments, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
  1 1/2 t  Lemon juice (juice of               1 lg Egg
           -half a medium lemon,               1 C  Oil
           -up to 2 T)               
 
  Place the egg and lemon juice (or vinegar) in a blender.  Blend at a high
  speed until the mixture starts to lose some of its yellow color and become
  a bit whiter.
  
  Pour the oil in slowly (in a constant stream over the course of about half
  a minute). Keep the lid on the blender as you do this (just lift the corner
  to pour in the oil),  or else it will spatter everywhere.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Many years ago I got tired of store-bought mayonnaise, because for me it
  was too sweet and had a rather odd texture.  Learning how to make
  mayonnaise turned out to be a challenge, with many failures along the way
  (which usually resulted in something on the order of mayonnaise soup). I
  find this recipe consistently works well. And surprisingly it, too, has a
  rather sweet taste. Yield: 1 cup.
  
  *  As you might guess, the type of oil you use affects the taste of the
  mayonnaise.  I suggest that you start with the oil you regularly cook with
  and then experiment from there.
  
  *  I've found that the biggest reason for failure is putting in too much
  acid (lemon juice/vinegar). The result is something akin to soup. Nothing
  will correct this failure. However, you can use this mayonnaise-soup in
  potato salad (or other similar salads).
  
  *  You can add small amounts (up to 1 t ) of spices, such as mustard (dried
  or prepared) and Tabasco sauce. Add these to the egg/acid mixture before
  pouring in the oil, so they get thoroughly mixed into the mayonnaise. This
  mayonnaise will normally keep for a maximum of three weeks if kept in a
  cold part of the refrigerator (such as the bottom shelf away from the door)

      Title: WALNUT HORNS
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 5 dozen
 
      2 C  Flour                               1 C  Brown sugar
      1 C  Butter                              1 C  Walnuts, ground
      8 oz Sour cream                        1/2 t  Cinnamon, ground
      1    Egg yolk                                 Butter
 
  Cream the flour and butter.  Mix in the sour cream and the egg yolk.
  
  Divide the dough into four parts, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for
  several hours.
  
  Mix together the brown sugar, walnuts and cinnamon.
  
  Roll each dough section on a floured surface until about 1/8 inch thick.
  Spread about 1/4 of the sugar/walnut/cinnamon mixture over each rolled
  dough section. Cut the dough into pie-shaped wedges and roll, beginning at
  the wide end.
  
  Place cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Brush with melted butter
  (about 2 T should be enough). Bake for about 20 minutes at 375 degrees F.
  If you remove the cookies from the oven before they turn brown, the dough
  will be softer and flakier. If you remove them after they have browned
  slightly, the dough will be crisper.
  
  Remove cookies from cookie sheet before they have cooled completely, or
  else they stick to the cookie sheet.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rolled, walnut-filled cookies -- This recipe has been in the family for
  a while. These cookies make great Christmas gifts.
  
  *  During my childhood, these cookies tasted wonderful.  However, now they
  strike me as a bit sweet.  You could probably decrease the amount of brown
  sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 and make up for the loss in volume by increasing the
  amount of nuts.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  Initial preparation:  10 minutes; chilling:  at least 2 hours;
  final preparation:  20 minutes; baking:  20 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the dough ingredients.

  degrees F. and bake for another 45 minutes or so (until a knife inserted
  halfway between the edge and the center comes out clean.  Remove and let
  cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  The traditional recipe for pecan pie -- If you use pecan halves it will
  look nicer than pecan pieces, but be more difficult to cut.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.

      Title: CASTILLIAN HOT CHOCOLATE
 Categories: Drinks, Spanish, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 C  Cocoa (powdered),                   7 t  Cornstarch (cornflour)
           -unsweetened                      1/2 C  Water
      1 C  Sugar                               4 C  Milk
 
  Mix the cocoa and sugar together.
  
  Dissolve the cornstarch (cornflour) in the water and combine with the
  cocoa-sugar mixture in a medium-sized saucepan.  Stir this until it is a
  smooth paste.  Begin heating this mixture, continuously stirring it with a
  whisk.  Gradually pour in the milk.  Continue stirring as you bring it to a
  simmer.  Simmer, stirring often, for about 10 minutes.  The cocoa is ready
  when it thickens and is glossy and smooth.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Thick, rich Spanish hot chocolate -- I first tasted this wonderful
  beverage while touring in northern Spain with a choir. It's not like any
  hot chocolate I've had anywhere else, and I was delighted to find a recipe
  in "The Vegetarian Epicure Book Two." It is the best hot chocolate in the
  world (at least to me.)
  
  *  The consistency of the finished product should resemble chocolate
  pudding that didn't quite set. If you halve this recipe, you'll get just
  the right amount for two large mug-fulls. This cocoa is especially
  fantastic when you dip churros into it (a churro is a sugary, deep-fried,
  doughnut-like stick, and if anyone wants to send out a recipe, I'd be most
  grateful).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: QUICK CHICKEN CURRY
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet

  pan and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add curry powder,
  whilst stirring, until the oil is soaked up by the powder.
  
  Place the cup of chicken stock into the pan and simmer till the liquid is
  reduced, stirring continuously.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick and easy-to-prepare chicken curry for one person.  This is a
  modified version of a recipe invented by my friend Myles Sinnott.
  
  *  Best served with brown rice or fried sliced potatoes.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: QUICK CHICKEN MARINARA
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Chicken breasts,                    8 oz Mozzarella cheese,
           -skinned                                 -sliced thinly
     16 oz Marinara sauce                 
 
  Place chicken breasts in baking pan.  Cover each breast with a few slices
  of cheese. Pour sauce over chicken and cheese. Cover lightly with foil.
  Bake in 350 degree F. oven for about 40 minutes.
  
  Spoon sauce from bottom of baking pan over chicken every 10 or 15 minutes.
  Remove foil for last 10 or 15 minutes of baking.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick and easy chicken with cheese and marinara -- This is the
  quickest chicken recipe I know. It's especially great for working parents,
  although I've used it for entertaining guests, as well. I don't remember
  where I got it from. Actually, I think I made it up!
  
  *  If you prefer, this can be prepared using boned chicken, in which case
  you should shorten the cooking time to 25 minutes.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: QUICK AVGOLEMONO SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Greek, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 C  White rice, cooked                  1    Lemon, juiced
      3 C  Chicken broth                       2 lg Eggs
 
  If you don't have any leftover white rice, put about 1 1/2 cup of rice on
  to cook.
  
  Heat the chicken broth to boiling.  While the chicken broth is heating,
  beat together the lemon juice and eggs in a small bowl or glass measuring
  cup until uniform in color.
  
  When the chicken broth is boiling, stir in the cooked rice.  Remove from
  heat and stir briskly while slowly pouring the egg mixture into the pot
  from about a foot in the air. The soup should end up resembling a cream
  soup and there should be no large, visible threads of egg.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Greek egg-lemon soup -- This is a perfect way to use up a little
  leftover rice.
  
  *  This recipe even works well with canned chicken broth since the lemon
  covers up the "canned" flavor.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy
  : Time:  20 minutes if you have to cook the rice, 10 minutes if you don't.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: QUICK MACADAMIA CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Garlic clove, pressed               1 lg Tomato
      4    Chicken breasts, boned            1/8 lb Macadamia nuts
    1/4 t  Dill                                4 T  Honey
    1/2    Sweet red pepper                  1/8 t  Sesame seeds
    1/4 lb Green beans (optional)                   Sesame oil
 
  Slice or chop all ingredients.  Saute the garlic in the sesame oil, until
  just fragrant. Add the dill and the chicken, and saute for about five
  minutes. Add the green beans and the red pepper; saute for another couple
  of minutes. Add the tomato and the macadamia nuts; saute another minute or
  two.  Add the honey and the sesame seeds. Continue cooking just long enough
  to warm the honey.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Quick and easy chicken with macadamia nuts and honey -- I devised this
  recipe last year.  We like it a lot, and it's very quick.
  
  *  This is wonderful served with couscous.  I recommend using chicken broth
  when cooking the couscous.
  
  *  If you want to take the time, you can thicken the sauce with about 1/4 t
  arrowroot, or some cornstarch.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

      Title: QUICK CHOCOLATE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 1 cake
 
--------------------------------CAKE MIXTURE--------------------------------
  1 3/4 C  Flour, self-raising               1/2 t  Bicarbonate of soda
           -(up to 2 C)                      1/4 t  Salt
  1 1/4 C  Caster sugar, or                    2    Eggs
           -white sugar chopped                1 C  Milk
           -in the blender                     4 oz Butter (or margarine)
      6 T  Cocoa (Use more if              1 1/2 t  Vanilla
           -you like)                    

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      1 C  Cream, whipped with               1/2 oz Copha
           -a little icing sugar                    Nuts
      3 oz Cooking chocolate              
 
  Sift the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.  Soften the butter and
  add with the milk and vanilla to dry ingredients. Beat for 2 mins with a
  wooden spoon or until smooth. Add eggs and beat another 2 mins. Pour into
  an 8-inch round cake tin (I find the collapsible type best). Cook in a
  moderate 350-375 degree F. oven for 1 hour.
  
  Turn the cooled cake over, slice into two layers and fill with cream.  Melt
  chocolate with copha (do not burn) and pour over cake, dribbling it down
  the side. Decorate with almonds, pecans or walnuts.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Dangerously delicious chocolate cake.
  
  *  Self-raising flour is popular in Britain and Australia, and hard to find
  in North America. Substitute about 2 cups of ordinary flour, all-purpose
  with about 1/2 t of salt and about 3 t of baking powder mixed in.
  
  *  The North American equivalent of caster sugar is "granulated sugar."
  There is no equivalent of copha, but a mixture of butter and coconut is
  better than nothing. Crisco has the right cooking properties to substitute
  for copha, but the wrong flavor.
  
  *  You can pour a little Grand Marnier into the cake before spreading the
  cream in the middle, but it doesn't need it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour to cool and 5
  minutes decorating. 5 minutes to eat.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients, though the cocoa and cream are not
  critical.

      Title: NANA MOON'S CHRISTMAS PUDDING
 Categories: Puddings, Christmas, Usenet
      Yield: 2 puddings
 
      3 C  Flour (unbleached)                  1 C  Brandy
    1/2 lb Suet (see note)                          -(or orange juice,
      1 C  Brown sugar                              -or a mixture of both)
      1 C  Bread crumbs                        1 T  Golden (cane) syrup
    3/4 lb Raisins                             5    Eggs
    3/4 lb Sultanas                          1/2 t  Baking soda
           -(or golden raisins)                1 T  Milk
    1/4 lb Currants                       
 
  Combine the suet, flour, sugar, bread crumbs, fruit and brandy.  Cover and
  allow to stand overnight.
  
  Add the syrup and beaten eggs.  Dissolve the baking soda in the milk, and
  add to mixture. Stir until everything's combined. (The mixture will be
  fairly thick. My mother used to get help at this stage by telling us that
  if we stirred it three times and made a wish, the wish would come true.
  This only works with Christmas puddings.)
  
  Place in two 1 1/2 quart pudding basins, cover with paper and several
  layers of aluminum foil, and steam for 4 hours.
  
  When you're going to eat it, steam it for a further 2 hours.  Serve by
  turning it out of the bowl, and pouring flaming brandy over it (see below).
  Serve with brandy butter (hard brandy sauce).
  
  This pudding needs time to age between when you cook it and Christmas.  My
  mother generally makes it about a month before.  Keep it in the
  refrigerator until the day you will be eating it.
  
  Each pudding will serve about 8-10 people.  If you halve the recipe, use 3
  eggs.  You can also add cherries, figs, almonds and so on when you're
  adding the fruit.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Old-fashioned Christmas boiled pudding -- This recipe was first written
  down by my great-grandmother.  It's an old-fashioned boiled pudding, and
  was always a special part of Christmas in my family. Nana Moon's family
  came from Sofala, the site of the 1851 gold rush in New South Wales,
  Australia, where they raised sheep (before the gold rush). It's probably
  based on an English recipe.
  
  This recipe differs from others I've seen in that it uses no spices, just
  dried fruit and brandy.  Perhaps spices were too difficult to get, it
  tastes great anyway. Makes two puddings.
  
  *  The suet can be replaced with some other form of shortening.  The
  packaged suet we used to be able to get in Australia was only about 35
  percent suet, the rest was cornflour (cornstarch). Avoid that at all costs.
  For a few years, we bought suet from the butcher and grated it ourselves
  (ok, we used a blender), but no one should have to do that (at least, not
  during an Australian summer).
  
  *  If you decide to go for authenticity and use a pudding bag, here's how:
  
  Get a large piece of calico (it must have a tight weave), and boil it for a
  few minutes.  Rub flour into the inner surface.  Place 1/2 the mixture on
  it, and bring the corners together, leaving room for the mixture to rise.
  Tie with string. Cook by immersing in boiling water, when you add extra
  water, it must be already boiling, or the pudding will get soggy. The
  pudding will be rounder, and have a better crust than one steamed in a
  pudding bowl.  A good crust means that the brandy won't soak in when you
  light it, so it'll burn for longer. Age the pudding by hanging it in a
  cool, dry place.  The problem with using a pudding bag is that it tends to
  grow mold if the climate is too humid.
  
  *  To light the pudding, heat about 1/4 cup of brandy in a saucepan.  Light
  it, then pour over the pudding and carry it to the table.

      Title: TUCSON TOSTADAS
 Categories: Appetizers, Southwest, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 md Flour tortillas                   1/3 lb Anejo cheese, grated
           -(buy the largest                 1/2 lb Poblano peppers, sliced
           -flour tortillas that                    -(or any other mild
           -will fit in your                        -chili pepper)
           -biggest frying pan)              1/4 C  Coriander (fresh),
    1/2 lb Oaxaca cheese, shredded                  -chopped fine
    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese,                    Lard or oil
           -shredded                                -for frying
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  If you are using fresh poblanos, roast them
  and remove their skins and seeds, If you are using canned poblanos, wash
  and drain them. Slice the peppers into thin decorative slices.
  
  In a big frying pan, fry a tortilla in lard or oil until it is golden
  brown. Remove to paper towels, drain well, then place on a baking sheet or
  pizza pan. Although lard is bad for you, the grim truth is that tortillas
  taste very much better when they have been fried in lard. Live dangerously.
  
  When the tortilla has cooled and hardened, cover it with a thin layer of
  Oaxaca cheese, then with the jack cheese.  Crumble anejo on top of those
  layers, then sprinkle finely-chopped coriander on top of that.
  
  Arrange the pepper slices in a geometric pattern on top of the cheeses.
  Bake for 5 minutes, or until the cheese has melted but not browned. Remove
  from the oven, and use a pizza cutter to slice into individual portions.
  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A toasted cheese tortilla snack popular in southern Arizona -- I first
  discovered this recipe in 1978 when I went to Tucson to visit my
  prospective in-laws. Such visits are often tense; Loretta's parents knew
  that I liked Mexican food, so they took me to their favorite restaurant,
  Casa Molina. The appetizer, a toasted cheese tostada, was so good that I
  forgot my nervousness and just chowed down on serving after serving. I
  think that her parents remembered from that visit more about my appetite
  than my personality.
  
  I tried several times to make Tucson tostadas, but they always ended up
  tasting like pizza.  Then a recipe appeared in the April 1986 issue of
  _Sunset_ magazine, and after reading it, I was able to reconstruct this
  replica of the Tostada Casa Molina.  The secret is to use Mexican cheeses.
  Yield:  Serves 6.
  
  *  Oaxaca (pronounced "oh-HOCK-a") cheese is a Mexican string cheese.  You
  can substitute any Mexican cheese marked "asadero" (melting cheese). If
  you're desperate, you can use Armenian mozzarella, which has the right
  texture but the wrong flavor. Monterey jack is a bland American cheddar;
  you can substitute good-quality Muenster.
  
  *  Anejo cheese is somewhat like Parmesan, dry and crumbly.  You can
  substitute Mexican cotija cheese, but that is probably pointless, because a
  store that carries cotija will probably also carry anejo.  Fresh-ground
  parmesan will do in a pinch, though it is not the right flavor.  In one of
  my many attempts to get this recipe right, I tried a mixture of Greek feta
  and cow's-milk romano cheese. It tasted very interesting, though not at all
  authentic.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy once you have found the ingredients.
  : Time:  10 minutes each.

      Title: TEX-MEX STYLE TACOS
 Categories: Meats, Tex-mex, Usenet
      Yield: 12 tacos
 
      2 lb Ground beef,                       12    Corn tortillas (the
           -extra-lean                              -thinner the better)
      1 md Onion, chopped fine               1/2 lb Cheddar cheese,
    1/2 t  Salt                                     -sharp, grated
      4 T  Chile powder                        1 lg Tomato, chopped
           -(or more to taste)                 3 C  Shredded lettuce
           Vegetable oil                  
 
  Brown the ground beef and chopped onion in a large skillet.  There should
  be enough fat in the beef to eliminate any need for extra oil and also to
  saute the onions at the same time. While you are browning the beef (it
  should be completely cooked with no pink or red color left), be sure to
  break it up so that it is granular in texture, as opposed to chunky, when
  completely browned. Onions should be limp and translucent but not brown.
  
  Drain off as much fat as possible.  Add salt and  chile powder and continue
  to saute until the chile is completely incorporated into the meat mixture.
  Cover skillet and leave on extremely low heat, just enough to keep the meat
  hot.
  
  Put about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a small skillet, and heat it.  Test
  the oil for proper temperature by putting in a small piece of tortilla.
  When the oil reaches the temperature where it immediately begins to bubble
  frantically over the tortilla as soon as it is put in the oil and the
  tortilla piece becomes crisp quite quickly, you are ready to cook the taco
  shells.  This is important because there is nothing worse than a soggy taco
  shell (which results from the oil not being hot enough).
  
  Using tongs, put the tortillas in the oil, one at a time,  and cook for
  30-60 seconds until the underside just starts to become crisp. With the
  tongs, turn the tortilla over and, using a spatula, bend in half to form
  the shell. Cook each side of the bent tortilla until crisp, about 30-45
  seconds per side. Remove the shell from the oil and drain on a
  newspaper-covered cookie sheet. The cooked shells can be kept warm in the
  oven at very low heat.
  
  To assemble, fill each shell about 2/3s full of the meat and top with
  cheese, tomato and lettuce. We like to add extra zap with a shot of Tabasco
  sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  San Antonio, Texas style tacos -- My dad is from east Texas and my mom
  from southern Oklahoma, but they developed their definition of Tex-Mex from
  several years in San Antonio. Since they now live in D.C., they feel
  extremely deprived, none of the chain restaurants come anywhere near the
  taste they developed in San Antonio.
  
  Tex-Mex cooking is based on peasant-style dishes from the areas of Mexico
  bordering Texas.  The primary ingredients of Tex-Mex cooking are corn
  tortillas (the thinner the better), ground beef, pinto beans and hot chile
  powder, sharp Cheddar cheese and onions.  Yield:  1 dozen tacos.
  
  *  Don't try to use instant onion in this recipe.  In San Antonio, people
  consider that the best chile  powder is Gebhardt's or Eagle Brand.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

      Title: FRIJOLES EN OLLA / FRIJOLES REFRITOS
 Categories: Legumes, Tex-mex, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
------------------------------FRIJOLES EN OLLA------------------------------
      1 lb Pinto beans (dried)                 4 sl Bacon (or less)
      1 lg Onion, quartered                    1 T  Salt

-----------------------------FRIJOLES REFRITOS-----------------------------
      4 C  Pinto beans (cooked),                    Broth from cooked
           -drained (or less)                       -pinto beans
      2 T  Vegetable oil              
 
  PREPARE FRIJOLES EN OLLA:  Pick through the dried pinto beans to remove
  small rocks (processors never seem to get rid of all of them). Rinse beans
  well several times until water runs clear and all grit is removed.
  
  Place beans in a large pot with enough water to reach 2/3's of the way up
  the pot. Bring water to a boil and add 1 large quartered onion and 3-4
  slices of bacon. During the cooking process, the onion will become mush.
  This and the bacon add real flavor to the beans.
  
  Cook over low heat for 3-4 hours until the beans are very soft and tender.
  Beans should just bubble, not boil, during the cooking process.  During the
  first 90 minutes, stir and check frequently.  The beans absorb a large
  amount of water and you will have to add some periodically to prevent
  burning.
  
  Add salt during the last 30 minutes.  Finished beans should have the
  consistency of bean soup, which I guess this is.
  
  PREPARE FRIJOLES REFRITOS:  Heat oil in a medium skillet.  Add drained
  cooked pinto beans to the skillet and mash up into a paste. (I use an old
  hand potato masher but a perforated metal cooking spoon also works well).
  
  Saute the beans over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently
  to prevent burning and adding a little bean broth as necessary for proper
  consistency.  The  finished beans should be like thick library paste in
  texture.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Tex-Mex style pinto beans are known in Mexico as "Frijoles En Olla," or
  beans in the pot.  This is the basis for refried beans (Frijoles Refrito),
  but we also like it as well as a side dish. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes, plus cooking time of frijoles en olla.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: TEX-MEX STYLE ENCHILADAS
 Categories: Meats, Tex-mex, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Ground beef,                    2 1/2 C  Enchilada sauce
           -extra-lean (as                          -(2 standard cans)
           -little fat as possible)            1 lb Cheddar cheese,
      2 md Onions, chopped                          -sharp, grated
      4 T  Flour                          
 
  PREPARE SAUCE AND FILLING:  Brown ground beef and 1 chopped onion in a
  large skillet. There should be enough fat in the beef to eliminate any need
  for extra oil and also to saute the onions at the same time. While you are
  browning the beef (it should be completely cooked with no pink or red color
  left), be sure to break it up so that it is granular in texture, as opposed
  to chunky, when completely browned. Onions should be limp and translucent
  but not brown.
  
  Add about 4 T  of flour and saute until flour is completely incorporated
  into the meat mixture. Add the enchilada sauce. Heat over low heat. If the
  mixture is too thick, add a little water.  The consistency should be that
  of a thick gravy, but not soupy. Simmer over low heat for 20-30 minutes.
  
  PREPARE ROLLED ENCHILADAS:  Rolled enchiladas are tougher to assemble, but
  more authentic.  Have ready a large baking pan, we always use an oblong
  Pyrex pan. One at a time, dip each tortilla in the enchilada sauce just
  enough to coat and slightly soften. Lay the tortilla flat in the baking
  pan, spoon about 3 T of the enchilada sauce in a line down the middle, top
  with about 1 t chopped onion and about 3 T of grated cheese.
  
  Roll the tortilla tightly into a cylinder with the seam on the bottom, and
  position against the bottom edge of the baking pan.  Repeat until the pan
  is full. This can get tricky (but it is possible) as the pan gets full.
  Assembling the enchilada outside of the pan is usually a messy disaster.
  Depending on the size of the pan and how tightly each enchilada is rolled,
  you can get 8-12 enchiladas in a pan. This recipe should make about 16-24
  enchiladas.
  
  Spoon enchilada sauce over the assembled enchiladas to thinly cover.
  Sprinkle generously with grated cheese. Bake at 425 degrees F. for 20
  minutes.
  
  PREPARE STACKED ENCHILADAS:  This is the New Mexico style.  It is much
  easier to assemble. Have plates ready. One at a time, submerge each
  tortilla in the enchilada sauce (which should be cooking on low heat during
  this process) and cook until limp but not falling apart, this may take a
  little practice to gauge the time.
  
  Remove the tortilla from the sauce and place flat on a plate.  Spoon a
  little sauce, including meat, over the tortilla, add about 1 T chopped
  onion and about 4 T grated cheese. Repeat the process until you have a
  stack of 3-4 tortillas on a plate, depending on the appetite of the person
  who will eat them. Top the last tortilla with a generous amount of sauce
  and cheese. Serve immediately.
  
  The fundamental difference between these two styles is the method used to
  cook the tortillas. In the rolled style, the sauce is cooked into the
  tortilla through the baking process. In the stacked style, the tortilla is
  cooked directly in the sauce. Only the appearance differs, the taste is the
  same with either style.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Central Texas style Mexican enchiladas -- We cook beef enchiladas in two
  ways, the traditional rolled enchilada and the easier-to-cook New Mexico
  stacked style.  Both procedures are given.  Also, we used to cook the
  enchilada sauce/chili from scratch but more recently began using a shortcut
  with canned Old El Paso brand enchilada sauce, since it is not only faster
  (20 minutes vs. 4+ hours) but also has a very authentic spice combination.
  Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  I always use Old El Paso canned enchilada sauce, though it is possible
  to make your own.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour.

      Title: CHALUPAS
 Categories: Entrees, Tex-mex, Usenet
      Yield: 12 chalupas
 
           Vegetable oil                     1/2 lb Cheddar cheese
     12    Corn tortillas (the                      -(sharp), grated
           -thinner the better)                1 lg Tomato, chopped
      6 C  Frijoles refritos                   3 C  Lettuce, shredded
           -(or less)                     
 
  In a small skillet, heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil.  Test the oil for
  proper temperature by putting in a small piece of tortilla.  When the oil
  reaches the temperature where it immediately begins to bubble frantically
  over the tortilla as soon as it is put in the oil and the tortilla piece
  becomes crisp quite quickly, you are ready to cook the chalupa shells. This
  is important because there is nothing worse than a soggy chalupa shell
  which results from the oil not being hot enough.
  
  Fry tortillas completely flat on both sides until very crisp.  Drain and
  keep warm on a newspaper-covered cookie sheet in a warm oven.
  
  Spread about 1/4-inch thick layer of refried beans on each fried tortilla.
  Top with a generous amount of grated sharp Cheddar cheese and about 1 T
  chopped onion.
  
  Place assembled chalupas on a cookie sheet and brown under broiler until
  cheese melts.  Watch them carefully under the broiler, they can burn quite
  quickly.  Top with shredded lettuce and tomato and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Tex-Mex style tostada -- You will need to first make a batch of frijoles
  refritos.  This dish is more properly known in Mexico as tostadas.

      Title: TARAMOSALATA
 Categories: Spreads, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 C  Smoked cod roe                      1 T  Onion, finely chopped
      1 C  Olive oil                                -(or more to taste)
      1    Garlic clove                             Black pepper,
      2 T  Lemon juice                              -freshly milled
      2 T  Chopped parsley                
 
  Cover cod roes for a few minutes in boiling water to loosen skins, then
  peel them.
  
  Crush garlic and rub around a mixing basin (bowl).  Discard garlic.  Dice
  roe, add about 2 T oil, and stand for 15 minutes to soften. Pass roe
  through sieve into garlic-rubbed basin and beat until smooth.
  
  Add half the lemon juice, gradually beat in the rest of the oil, adding the
  remainder of the lemon juice at the half-way stage.  Stir in the chopped
  onion, parsley and black pepper to taste.  Chill and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Greek smoked fish-roe pate -- This is a particular family favorite at my
  parents' house.  The word Taramosalata means "fish egg salad" in Greek.
  
  *  This recipe can be made with any kind of fish roe.  Greeks sometimes add
  about 1/2 cup of cooked potatoes.
  
  *  The only tricky bit comes in adding the oil:  you should do it a little
  at a time like preparing mayonnaise, and be careful not to let the oil
  separate. If it does begin to separate, add another dash of lemon juice.
  
  *  Taramosalata will keep for about a week under refrigeration.

      Title: SWEET POTATOES
 Categories: Entrees, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 1/4 lb Sweet potatoes                    1/2 t  Salt
           -(canned or precooked)              1 ds Pepper
      2 C  Milk                                1 ds Cinnamon
      3 T  Brown sugar                       1/4 C  Raisins
      3 T  Butter, melted                           Marshmallows
 
  Mash sweet potatoes by putting through a sieve or beating in an electric
  beater or using a potato masher or food mill.  Add milk gradually (if you
  add it too fast it splashes and is hard to mix in).
  
  Mix in remaining ingredients.  Put in buttered casserole.  Heat through
  (bake in slow oven 250 degrees F.) for 20-30 minutes, or in microwave).
  
  Cover top with marshmallows.  Return to oven until marshmallows are
  slightly melted and a bit brown. (If the oven is too hot, the marshmallows
  will disappear!) This step cannot be done in the microwave.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallows -- This recipe is traditional in
  my family for holiday dining. It comes from my great-grandmother.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy with an electric mixer.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking.

      Title: SWEET POTATO PIE
 Categories: Pies, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Sweet potatoes                      2    Eggs
      1 C  Sugar, granulated                   1 t  Vanilla
     12 T  Butter, unsalted                  1/2 t  Nutmeg
           -(or use corn-oil                   1    Pie crust, unbaked
           -margarine)                    
 
  Boil potatoes until tender (20-30 minutes).  Drain and peel.
  
  In a blender, put the potatoes, sugar and butter.  Mix up a little, then
  add eggs, vanilla and nutmeg. Blend ingredients together well, until
  mixture is very smooth. Pour into unbaked pie shell and bake at 375 degrees
  F. for 45-55 minutes until filling is set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is an extremely simple and extremely good pie recipe.  You can even
  cheat and use store-bought pie crusts, in which case the whole thing takes
  about 5 minutes to put together.  Yield:  Serves 3-8.
  
  *  If you don't want to make your own pie shell, I find that the Pet Ritz
  factory pie shells work well.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

      Title: BEEF STROGANOFF
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Round steak or                      1 t  Nutmeg
           -other beef fillet                  1 T  Chives, chopped
      8 oz Mushrooms (canned),                 1 t  Garlic, minced
           -sliced                                  -(or more to taste)
     12 oz Sour cream                               Salt
      4 oz Wine, white                              Pepper
      2 T  Onion, chopped                           Pasta (or steamed rice)
      2 T  Worcestershire sauce           
 
  Cut meat into strips about 1/2-inch thick by 2 inches long.  Saute the
  onions in butter until brown. Place meat in pan with onions. Sear quickly
  in frying pan along with onion. (This seals the juices inside.) Avoid
  overcooking the meat.
  
  Add mushrooms and stir in the wine, chives and garlic for about 5 minutes.
  Finally add sour cream, Worcestershire sauce and chives, and simmer until
  it almost boils. Serve on noodles or steamed white rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sumptuous beef stroganoff -- This easy recipe can be served either on
  steamed rice or on noodles.
  
  *  You may want to vary the thickness of the sauce.  I do this by adding
  sour cream to thicken, or adding wine to lighten.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 to 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: STOLLEN
 Categories: Breads, German, Christmas, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
    1/4 oz Yeast (dried), active               1 C  Almonds (blanched),
           -(1 package)                             -chopped
    3/4 C  Water, warm                       1/2 C  Citronat (candied
    1/2 C  Sugar, granulated                        -lemon peel), cut
      3 lg Eggs                                     -into small pieces
      1    Egg yolk                          1/2 C  Orangenat (candied
    1/2 C  Butter, soft                             -orange peel), cut
  3 1/2 C  Flour                                    -into small pieces
      1 T  Lemon peel, grated                1/2 C  Raisins
 
  Dissolve the yeast in the water and proof it.  Add the sugar, eggs, egg
  yolk, butter and half of the flour. Beat for 10 minutes. Blend in the
  remaining flour, nuts, fruits and peel. Let rise about 1 1/2 hours, until
  doubled. Punch down, cover and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Knead the dough.  Roll into one or two rectangles, butter it, and fold over
  the edges to make a rolled loaf.  Place on a greased cookie sheet with the
  folded edges down.  Spread with a combination of 1 egg white and about 1 T
  water.  Let rise until doubled in size (45 to 60 minutes).  Bake 30-35
  minutes at 375 degrees F. until golden brown.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional German Christmas bread -- Germans traditionally eat Stollen
  around Christmas time.  This recipe comes from someone I went to school
  with. She, and her parents, who are from southern Germany, recommended it
  as quite an authentic recipe. It is indeed a very tasty and rich bread.
  Makes 1 large or 2 small loaves.
  
  *  My loaves of stollen come out somewhat wide and short.  Some
  traditionalists make them long and narrow.  You can also make them in
  normal bread pans instead of on cookies sheets, in which case you should
  increase the baking time somewhat.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  hand-on time:  30 minutes;  rising times:  1 1/2 hours + overnight
  + 1 hour; baking time: 30-35 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients, though you can experiment with the
  fruits and nuts.

      Title: ROSALIE'S CHEESE AND SPINACH PIE
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 1 pie
 
      1 lb Ricotta cheese                    1/4 C  Yellow onion, diced
           -(skim-milk)                        6 lg Mushrooms, thinly sliced
      4 oz Gruyere cheese, grated              2 oz Ham (Danish-style),
           -(or Swiss cheese)                       -diced
      1    Egg, lightly beaten                 2 T  Butter
     10 oz Spinach, cooked                          Nutmeg, salt and white
           -(1 package of frozen                    -pepper, to taste
           -spinach, or use fresh)                  Olive oil
      2 sm Zucchini, thinly sliced        
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Cook the spinach.  Drain thoroughly and
  squeeze out all moisture possible.  Heat butter over medium-high flame
  until foamy. Add onion, zucchini and mushrooms, and saute until onion is
  soft and translucent. Add ham and spinach and saute briefly to warm
  through. Remove from heat.
  
  In mixing bowl, mix together ricotta cheese and vegetables.  Add grated
  cheese and blend. Add beaten egg and blend thoroughly. Season to taste with
  nutmeg, salt and white pepper.
  
  Grease quiche pan with just enough olive oil to coat.  Pour in mixture and
  smooth the top with a spatula.  Dot with 3-4 pats of butter.  Bake at 425
  degrees F. for about 30-40 minutes, until top is browned and knife inserted
  in center comes out clean.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich spinach pie with ham and cheese -- I ate this dish at Cafe Le Rat
  in Middleburg, Virginia, and was delighted to find their recipe in
  _Gourmet_ magazine in the late 1970s. I have modified the recipe somewhat
  from the published version to make it less stringy and sticky.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking and cooling.

      Title: SEVICHE ACAPULCO
 Categories: Fish, Appetizers, Mexico, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Turbot fish,                        1 C  Lime juice
           -in fillets                         1    Serrano chile, chopped
      1    Onion, chopped                      1 T  Ketchup
      2    Tomatoes, chopped                   1 T  White wine
      1    Avocado, chopped                    2    Jalapeno chilies,
      1 C  Green olives (small)                     -chopped
      6 T  Olive oil                           2 oz Capers
      2 T  Parsley, chopped               
 
  Cut the fish fillets into about 1-inch cubes.  Marinate it for at least 6
  hours (preferably overnight) in about 1/2 cup of lime juice.
  
  Rinse the fish in a colander and let it dry for 5 minutes.  Put it in a
  large bowl along with the rest of the lime juice. Put in the rest of the
  ingredients.  Add salt, pepper and oregano to taste.  Mix.  Serve with
  salted crackers.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A tasty, marinated fish appetizer from Mexico -- This recipe comes from
  the Delicias Culinarias cookbook that I brought from Mexico. The
  introduction to the recipe reads: "Seviche is prepared with raw marinated
  fish.  It is very popular in Ecuador, Peru and in the north of Chile.
  Depending on the region in Mexico, there exist several different styles to
  prepare it.  This recipe comes from the Acapulco region".
  
  I am sure that you have tasted this appetizer if you have ever been to a
  beach in Mexico. It is usually served right where you are "roasting" in the
  sun or swimming. Yes, the fish in this recipe is raw. However it is
  "cooked" by marinating it in lime juice.
  
  *  Use fresh lime juice.  You can use any kind of fish that you like with
  the condition that it does not fall apart after marinating. For instance,
  it does not work with white fish.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes (after marinating the fish).
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      1 sm Onion chopped                       2 T  Cooking oil
    1/2    Green pepper, chopped               1 C  White rice (raw)
      6 oz Tomatoes (1 small can)              2 C  Water
    1/2    Garlic clove, crushed

  the chopped onion and pepper in the frying pan and cook until the onion
  becomes soft.
  
  Add the tomatoes, garlic, sardines, salt and pepper to the frying pan and
  cook until for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve over the
  rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sardines with garlic and tomato -- A quick and easy meal for two people.
  This is a recipe conjured up by my friend Carole Senior.

      Title: SALMON-SPINACH LOAF
 Categories: Fish, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Salmon (1 large can)           10 3/4 oz Mushroom soup,
    3/4 lb Spinach, fresh                           -condensed (1 can)
      2    Eggs                                1 C  Cornflakes (uncrushed)
      2 T  Onion, grated                     1/4 C  Flour, all-purpose
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Rinse spinach thoroughly.  Cook spinach
  with a small amount of water for 5-10 minutes, or until tender. Discard
  cooking water.
  
  Clean salmon as desired and drain excess liquid.  Place salmon, spinach,
  eggs, undiluted soup, cornflakes, flour and onion in large mixing bowl.
  Beat with electric mixer at medium speed for about three minutes or until
  ingredients are chopped and mixture is blended. Stop to scrape bowl and
  beaters as needed.
  
  Grease a 9x5x2 1/2-inch loaf pan and pack the mixture in.  Bake for 40 to
  50 minutes or until set and lightly browned. Cool slightly before serving.
  Do not try to unmold; serve directly from baking pan. The finished loaf
  will have the consistency of spoonbread.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A baked salmon and spinach loaf -- This recipe is a pleasant compromise
  between a salmon loaf and a spinach souffle.  It can be made with stale
  spinach and canned salmon.  It does not have a strong flavor or texture of
  spinach, as do some cooked spinach dishes.
  
  *  You can substitute concentrated dried cream-of-mushroom soup for canned
  condensed soup, or use a thick flavored white sauce.
  
  *  There is no point in using good-quality salmon in this recipe; chum or
  pink salmon are fine.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

-------------------------------PARMESAN CRUST-------------------------------
  1 1/2 C  Flour                             3/4 C  Shortening
    1/2 C  Parmesan cheese,                    3 T  Water (more as needed)
           -grated                       

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
 15 1/2 oz Salmon (1 large can)                4    Eggs
      1 lg Onion, diced                    1 1/2 C  Gruyere cheese,
      1    Garlic clove, minced                     -shredded
      2 T  Butter                              1 t  Dill weed
      2 C  Sour cream                        1/4 t  Salt
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Make parmesan crust:  Combine flour and
  parmesan cheese.  Cut in shortening until mixture resembles size of small
  peas.  Sprinkle with about 2 T water.  Form into a dough, adding more water
  as needed. Press into an 8-inch springform pan. Bake at 375 degrees F. for
  10 minutes.
  
  Make filling:  Saute onion and garlic in butter until onion is soft.
  
  Beat sour cream and eggs until blended.  Drain salmon and break into
  bite-size pieces. Stir into sour cream mixture along with vegetables, about
  1 cup gruyere, crumbled dill weed and salt. Pour into baked crust; top with
  remaining gruyere.  Bake at 375 degree F. oven for 65 to 70 minutes.  Cool
  15 minutes in pan. Remove sides of pan and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A salmon and cheese pie flavored with sour cream -- This is a country
  cousin to the quiche, even real men will eat it.  My mother says this is
  called "country" salmon pie because it uses canned salmon, which is the
  only kind you can catch out in the country.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes to prepare, 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 hours to bake and set.

      Title: HOT RUM TODDY
 Categories: Drinks, Usenet
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 lb Dark brown sugar                    1 t  White cardamom,
    1/2 lb Butter, salted                           -ground
      1 t  Nutmeg, ground                           Dark rum, top-quality
      1 t  Cinnamon, ground                         -(a standard "fifth"
      1 t  Cloves, ground                           -will serve 12)
 
  MAKING THE BATTER:  Put all batter ingredients (everything but the rum) in
  a food processor and run it until the mixture turns creamy. Fold it down
  once with a rubber spatula to make sure the spices are blended in, and run
  the food processor some more.
  
  Scoop the mixture into a plastic container, and refrigerate.  It will keep
  for many months in the refrigerator, even though it contains butter.
  
  MAKING THE DRINKS:  Fill a coffee mug half full of boiling water.  The
  easiest way to do this is to put a mug of hot water in the microwave. If
  you don't have a microwave, then fill the mug with boiling water, pour it
  out, then fill it half full of boiling water.
  
  Add about 2 generous tablespoons of batter.  Stir until the batter
  dissolves in the hot water. I use a small wire whisk for this stirring.
  
  Add 2 jiggers (about 3 oz) of the best rum you can afford.  When I make
  this in quantities for parties I like to use Myers Dark Rum.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Ultimate hot buttered rum recipe -- I started making hot buttered rum
  from a Trader Vic recipe 15 years ago, and I have gradually evolved it by
  adding more spices, more butter and less rum.
  
  The way you make a hot buttered rum is to add some "batter" to some rum,
  and heat it. I like to keep a made-up batch of the batter in the
  refrigerator in an old margarine tub. For parties I make up a fresh batch.
  
  *  One theory of hot-toddy making is that it is impossible to use too much
  batter, and you should keep stirring more in until you are bored with
  stirring.  Another theory of hot-toddy making is that it is impossible to
  use too much rum, and that you should keep stirring in more until your
  friends panic.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Cookies, Christmas, Usenet
      Yield: 3 dozen
 
----------------------------------COOKIES----------------------------------
      1 C  Brown sugar                     1 3/4 C  Flour, sifted
    1/2 t  Salt                              1/2 t  Baking powder
    1/2 C  Butter, softened                  1/4 t  Baking soda
      1    Egg                               1/4 t  Cinnamon
    1/2 t  Vanilla                       

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
  1 1/2 C  Confectioner's sugar              1/8 t  Salt
      1    Egg white,                        1/2 t  Vanilla
           -slightly beaten                         Food coloring
      1 T  Butter, melted                           -(optional)
 
  Mix sugar, salt and butter thoroughly.  Add egg and vanilla and beat till
  fluffy.
  
  Sift flour, baking powder, soda and cinnamon and add to mixture.  Chill
  well, several hours, or overnight.
  
  MAKE THE GLAZE:  Mix the glaze ingredients together until smooth.
  
  Roll the dough out until it is about 1/8 inch thick.  Cut into fancy shapes
  and bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees F.  Let
  cool and glaze.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rolled cookies for the Christmas holidays -- I almost never make these
  cookies except at Christmas time.  They just seem to be Christmas cookies.
   (I did make a batch of heart shaped ones last Valentine's day for my
  then-fiance.)  I usually make these cookies in  Christmas shapes and frost
  them with green and red frosting.  This is a good recipe for kids to help
  out with.
  
  *  It helps to keep most of the dough in the refrigerator while you are
  cutting shapes.  It cuts much better when it is cold.
  
  *  These are time-consuming and fairly difficult, but worth it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chill, 1 hour cutting and
  baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: HALF MOON BAY PUMPKIN BREAD
 Categories: Quick bread, Usenet
      Yield: 3 loaves
 
      3 C  Sugar, granulated                   1 C  Vegetable oil
  3 1/2 C  Flour, all-purpose                  2 C  Pumpkin (cooked)
    1/2 t  Salt                              2/3 C  Water
      2 t  Baking soda                     1 1/2 C  Walnuts, chopped
      1 t  Cinnamon                                 Cream cheese (optional;
      1 t  Nutmeg                                   -for serving)
      4 lg Eggs                           
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Butter your containers well.
  
  Sift the dry ingredients together into a large bowl.  Make a well in the
  center of the dry ingredients, and add the eggs, oil, pumpkin and water.
  Beat thoroughly. It's easier to get all the lumps out if you use an
  electric mixer. Stir in the walnuts with a wooden spoon.
  
  Pour the batter into the containers, filling each only half to two-thirds
  full.  Bake for 60-90 minutes, depending on the sizes of your containers.
  If you're using a very small container, start checking much sooner. The
  bread is done when a toothpick in the middle comes out clean.
  
  Cool about ten minutes, then loosen the edges of the bread with a knife,
  and turn out of the pans to cool the rest of the way on a rack. For baking
  containers, you can use a loaf pan, metal cans, or whatever.  I usually use
  1-pound coffee cans, and it takes three of them.  If you want tiny loaves,
  you could probably use soup cans.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A dessert bread made from pumpkins -- Every year in Half Moon Bay,
  California there is a Pumpkin Festival, at which prizes are given for the
  largest pumpkin in the world.  Never mind that  for the last two years the
  winner has been in Nova Scotia:  the citizens of Half Moon Bay take
  pumpkins very seriously.
  
  At Christmas time in Half Moon Bay, people give each other little tins of
  this bread as presents. I also take it backpacking, because it's pretty
  resistant to being squashed (and tastes fine even when it is). Yield: 3
  1-pound loaves.
  
  *  I think the nuts are important in this recipe.  Unless you absolutely
  hate them, leave them in.
  
  *  It's not necessary, but you can serve some good cream cheese with it to
  spread on the slices if you like.

      Title: PORK CHOPS ITALIANO
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    Pork loin chops                     1    Onion, diced
 10 1/2 oz Tomato soup, condensed              1    Bay leaf
           -(1 small can)                           Oil for frying
      1    Green pepper, sliced                     Salt and pepper
 
  Heat the oil in a saucepan or frying pan (choose one with a lid).  Season
  both sides of the chops with salt and pepper to taste. Brown the chops
  quickly on both sides. Remove from the pan.
  
  Fry the onions until soft, but not brown.  You may need to add a little
  more fat, but I prefer to use as little as possible. Return the chops to
  the pan, add the tomato soup, green pepper and bay leaf. Bring to the boil,
  then simmer gently for 30-40 minutes, or until the chops are cooked.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pork chops simmered in tomato and onion -- Apologies to anyone of
  Italian descent, I'm sure this dish will seem a slander on your culinary
  heritage, but that's the way I learned this recipe.
  
  As much as I like grilled pork chops, I enjoy a change.   This recipe isn't
  haute cuisine, but I think it is particularly good when you get home from
  work on a cold, wet evening. The preparation is fairly quick, and it leaves
  you time to warm up in front of the fire with a cup of tea and read a
  newspaper.
  
  *  I serve this with rice.  If you like brown rice, it has the advantage of
  taking as long to cook as the rest of the meal, so you get an uninterrupted
  half-hour.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: STEAMED PERSIMMON PUDDING
 Categories: Puddings, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 C  Persimmon pulp,                     1 C  Sugar
           -pureed (about 2                1 1/2 t  Baking soda
           -large persimmons)                  1 t  Salt
    1/2 C  Milk                              1/2 t  Cinnamon
      2 T  Butter, melted                      1 C  Raisins, golden
      2 t  Vanilla extract                   1/2 C  Walnuts, chopped
      2 C  Flour, all-purpose             
 
  Blend together the persimmon pulp, milk, butter and vanilla.  Sift flour,
  measure, and sift again with sugar, soda, salt and cinnamon.
  
  Combine the liquid ingredients with the dry ingredients, and stir in the
  raisins and nuts.  Pour into a well-buttered 6-cup mold.  Cover tightly
  with a buttered lid.
  
  Place the mold in a deep pan, using a rack or inverted perforated foil pan
  to keep the mold out of the water. Pour boiling water into the deep pan
  just up to, but not touching, the mold.
  
  Cover tightly and keep the water simmering; add boiling water as necessary.
  Steam the pudding for 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending upon the size
  and shape of the mold.  The pudding is done when a toothpick comes out
  clean.
  
  Cool about 10 minutes before unmolding.  Serve warm, with hard sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Holiday persimmon pudding with walnuts -- This is a simple steamed
  pudding gotten from Sunset Magazine many years ago. It has become a holiday
  tradition with my family. Yield: Serves 6-10.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 2 hours steaming.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: KYLIE'S MUESLI BARS
 Categories: Usenet
      Yield: 15 bars
 
      1 C  Oats (rolled)                       4 oz Butter
      3 C  Cornflakes, crushed               1/2 C  Brown sugar, packed
      1 C  Coconut (desiccated)              1/2 C  Honey
  1 1/2 C  Fruit, dried (mixed)              1/2 C  Peanut butter
  3 1/2 t  Full-cream milk powder         
 
  Mix the oats, cornflakes, coconut, dried fruit and milk powder together in
  a big bowl.
  
  Simmer butter, sugar, honey and peanut butter together for 3 minutes, or
  microwave on high for 4 minutes (from cold), stirring every minute.  Pour
  sauce into dry mixture and mix well.
  
  Press into a biscuit tray and put in refrigerator until cold.  Cut when
  cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Delicious and nourishing bars for hiking or home -- This is a recipe
  that my daughter, Kylie, has perfected, starting from one published in some
  magazine.  They are ideal to use as trail bars, being both filling and full
  of energy, but are also perfect as snacks at home or work. When on a hard
  bushwalk, eating these is a real highlight of my day.
  
  *  The bars are best kept in the refrigerator, although it's by no means
  essential.  They soften in the heat but don't disintegrate.
  
  *  Any other cereal crumbs can be combined with cornflakes to make up the 3
  cups.  It's a good way to use up those otherwise annoying scraps.  If too
  much powdery stuff goes in, the bars can be somewhat dense. Using Rice
  Bubbles (Rice Krispies) gives a lighter texture.
  
  *  Desiccated coconut is best, as shredded coconut is too course.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.

      Title: MUESLI
 Categories: Grains, Usenet
      Yield: 4 cups
 
      3 C  Rolled oats                       1/2 C  Nuts
      1 C  Dried fruit,                      3/4 C  Sunflower seeds,
           -assorted                                -shelled
      1 C  Bran                                1 C  Banana chips
    1/4 C  Sesame seeds                   
 
  Mix all ingredients together.  Serve (about 5 heaped dessert spoons seems
  about the right amount) with milk, cream, yoghurt, or whatever you like on
  breakfast cereal.  I've heard that fruit juice is an alternative, but I
  haven't tried it.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  The trouble with buying packaged muesli is that it generally contains
  salt and sugar, often in larger quantities than you might choose for
  yourself. Making your own muesli is quick and easy, and you can change the
  ingredients and alter the proportions to suit yourself. After a few
  experiments, I've settled on this recipe.
  
  *  Use your own choice of dried fruits.  I like to cut 4 or 5 pieces of
  dried apricot into slivers, making up the balance with sultanas or raisins.
  I generally use unsalted peanuts, but I'm sure most nuts would be fine (how
  about almonds?).  One word of warning:  if you use quick-cooking oats
  instead of rolled oats, the result is decidedly mushy.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: HIPPO POT DE MOUSSE
 Categories: Mousse, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 oz Semisweet chocolate                      -cream will do nicely)
      2 oz Bittersweet chocolate               1 t  Almond extract
      2 C  Heavy cream,                             -(optional)
           -well-chilled (whipping        
 
  Melt the chocolate together in the top of a double boiler.  Be careful to
  do this slowly, so as not to burn the chocolate, and to keep all moisture
  away from the pot. Let the chocolate cool for five minutes.
  
  While the chocolate cools, whip the cream and almond extract together until
  very stiff.  Gently fold the cooled chocolate into the whipped cream. There
  will be many flecks of chocolate in the mixture.
  
  If you're not going to eat it all yourself, spoon into six large wine
  glasses. Chill one hour.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Extremely quick and easy chocolate mousse -- This is an adaptation of a
  very easy chocolate mousse recipe from Sandra Boynton's hilarious book,
  "Chocolate, the Consuming Passion."  It requires none of the laborious
  preparation that most French mousse recipes call for, and really optimizes
  the effort needed to consume the chocolate, which is, after all, what this
  is all about. Yield: Serves one to six people.
  
  *  If you're careful, you can also melt the chocolate in a microwave oven,
  in its wrapper. If you try this, be especially mindful of the semisweet
  chocolate, as the sugar therein caramelizes very quickly, leading to an
  awful mess (and ruined chocolate).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour chilling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: SALTED-COD PUDDING
 Categories: Fish, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Cod, salted                         3 lg Eggs
    1/4 C  Rice                                     Butter
  1 1/4 C  Milk                           
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Boil the salted cod until fully cooked.
  Take it out of the water and leave to cool. Skin the fish, de-bone it and
  make a stew out of it in a bowl, not adding anything.
  
  Boil the rice and mix it with the fish in the bowl to make a good mixture.
  
  Beat the eggs and mix it with the milk.
  
  Put the fish/rice mixture in a heat-resistant dish in which you have spread
  the butter.  Pour the milk/egg mixture over it and put it in the oven for
  40 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich pudding with salt cod, eggs and milk -- This was cooked on a TV
  program a few days ago and is very nice.
  
  *  Icelandic saltfish is mostly exported to Spain, Portugal and Italy,
  where it is used in Christmas main dishes. Here in Iceland we just boil it,
  and usually eat it with boiled potatoes and boiled turnips, cut in pieces.
  As the fish is a bit dry we use butter with it, and sometimes brown bread.
  
  *  If you cannot get salt cod, you can make your own by salting a cod
  fillet and leaving it in the salt, refrigerated, for 3 or 4 days, then wash
  thoroughly.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.

-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
      1 T  Red pepper, ground              1 1/4 t  Garlic powder
      1 t  Salt (optional)                   3/4 t  Onion powder
  1 1/2 t  Sweet paprika                     3/4 t  Thyme
  1 1/2 t  Black pepper                      3/4 t  Oregano

-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
      1 lb Orange marmalade                    5 T  Brown mustard
           -or apricot jam                     5 T  Horseradish
           -(use an entire jar)          

-----------------------------SHRIMP AND BATTER-----------------------------
      2    Eggs                               48 md Shrimp (peeled),
  1 3/4 C  Flour                                    -with tails
    3/4 C  Beer                                3 C  Coconut (unsweetened),
      1 T  Baking powder                            -grated
 
  Combine the seasoning mix together in a bowl.  Stir the dipping sauce
  ingredients together in a second bowl.  Have this ready at the table when
  the shrimp are done.
  
  Mix together about 2 t of the seasoning mix, about 1 1/4 cups of flour, the
  beer and the baking powder, and place this in a third bowl.
  
  Combine the remaining flour with another 2 t of the seasoning mix.
  
  Coat each shrimp with the remaining seasoning mix, then in the flour
  mixture, then in the batter, then in the coconut. Deep-fry the shrimp for
  about 1 minute and drain on paper towels.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Shrimp in coconut beer batter with dipping sauce -- Adapted from Chef
  Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen." A nice appetizer, though very
  caloric.
  
  *  Don't put too much batter on or it will overwhelm the poor shrimp.  The
  dipping sauce is great for other things as well.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you can deep-fry.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Measure batter, improvise with spices and dipping sauce.

      Title: CHOPPED LIVER
 Categories: Poultry, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken livers                      3 T  Schmaltz (chicken
      1 lg Onion                                    -fat; see note below)
      2    Garlic cloves                       3    Eggs, hard-boiled
 
  Melt the schmaltz in a large frying pan.  Saute the onions and garlic in
  the schmaltz until the onions are tender. Add the chicken livers and saute
  until done. (Livers are done when they are no longer red or pink on the
  inside.)
  
  Chop the cooked livers and onions, along with the hard boiled eggs.  I
  always chop by hand, using a chopper and a wooden bowl. Regardless of how
  you chop them, they should be fairly coarsely chopped. Season with a little
  salt and a little more melted schmaltz if things are dry.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chopped liver Just like Mom used to make -- This is NOT liver pate; it's
  chopped liver.  And lots of folks who claim to hate liver love this stuff.
  
  *  Schmaltz is rendered (melted) chicken fat.  If you want to make your own
  (which I recommend), get some chicken fat (from the butcher, or from a
  chicken you fix; one chicken's fat is plenty). Put the fat in a frying pan
  on low heat. Stir the pieces of fat frequently; if there's lots of fat, you
  can drain the pan into a container to keep things from splattering too
  much. The fat will eventually melt down to a tough, dry blob (the
  griveners, which are pure poison, but I love 'em!), at which point you're
  done rendering.  The liquid fat is the schmaltz.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Poultry, Italian, Usenet
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      1    Chicken, cut into parts             3    Garlic cloves
           -(or use breast pieces)                  Rosemary
      1 C  Wine vinegar                        1 t  Sugar
      1 C  Olive oil                                Salt and pepper
      1 C  White wine, dry                
 
  Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof frying pan.  Crush the garlic and
  saute for 15-20 minutes.  Be careful not to burn the garlic.
  
  Clean and trim chicken, leaving the skin on.  Add to frying pan, then add
  salt and pepper. Cook on medium heat until the chicken begins to brown.
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Add the vinegar and bring to a boil.  Partially cover, lower heat, and cook
  until the liquid is reduced to the original volume.  Add crushed rosemary
  to taste. Add wine and sugar, return to boil, reduce heat, and cook
  partially covered until the liquid is again reduced to its original volume.
  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15-20 minutes or until brown.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Southern-Italian style baked chicken -- This is one of my favorite
  recipes. It was recommended by a very close friend who got it from an old
  cookbook.
   It is very easy and can be whipped up on short notice. I really like it
  for its garlic and wine taste.
  
  *  I usually use a white California Zinfandel wine.

      3    Eggs                                1 C  Applesauce
      2 C  Flour, all-purpose                1/4 C  Dark molasses (treacle)
      1 t  Baking powder                       1 C  Raisins
    1/2 t  Salt                              1/2 C  Nuts, chopped
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar
  until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
  addition.
  
  Combine flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg; set aside. Combine
  applesauce and molasses.
  
  Add dry ingredients alternately with applesauce mixture  to egg mixture.
  Fold in raisins and nuts. Pour into a greased 9 1/4 x 5 1/4 x 2 3/4 inch
  loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted
  into the center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes, remove from pan and
  continue cooling on a wire rack.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple, fragrant, apple-nut raisin bread -- I found this recipe on the
  back of a label for a baking loaf pan.  It is easy to make and because of
  the molasses it is very fragrant while baking. Yield: 1 large loaf.

  Cream together the shortening and sugar.  Beat in the eggs, salt and
  flavorings.  Stir in the flour until blended.  Chill in the refrigerator
  for an hour or two.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Roll out on a floured surface to a
  thickness of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut with the cookie cutters of your
  choice (this was always a cause for argument in our family). Bake on
  ungreased cookie sheets until tan around the edges, about 8-10 minutes.
  Allow to cool.
  
  Make the frosting by beating together the sugar, milk and vanilla until
  smooth.  Divide and color each portion.  Frost the cookies.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Frosted cookie-cutter cookies -- My mom got this recipe many years ago
  in a cookbook that came in installments, so it didn't have a name on the
  binder and I don't know what it was called. She had us (the kids) make
  these cookies every year. Yield: 2-4 dozen.
  
  *  These cookies are about the only ones I know that taste better cooked
  and cold than as raw dough.
  
  *  Cinnamon red hots make good eyes for animals or Santas.

      Title: PICADILLO
 Categories: Meats, Latin, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 T  Olive oil or                        1    Jalapeno chili, seeded
           -vegetable oil                           -and chopped (or more
      2 lb Ground beef, lean                        -to taste)
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped             1/2 C  Raisins (soaked 10
      1    Garlic clove,                            -minutes in warm water)
           -finely chopped                   1/2 C  Pimento-stuffed olives,
      3 md Tomatoes, peeled                         -halved crosswise
           -and chopped                      1/2 t  Oregano
      2    Tart cooking apples,              1/2 t  Thyme
           -peeled, cored                           Salt
           -and chopped                             Pepper
    1/2 C  Almonds, slivered                   1 T  Butter
 
  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet.  Add the beef and saute until it is
  lightly browned, stirring to break up any lumps.  Add the onion and garlic
  and saute for 5 minutes longer. Add all the remaining ingredients except
  the butter and the almonds. Mix well and simmer, uncovered, over moderate
  heat, stirring from time to time, for 20 minutes.
  
  In a small skillet, heat the butter and saute the almonds until they are
  golden brown.
  
  Mound the beef onto a serving platter and sprinkle with the almonds.
  Surround it with a border of rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Latin-American seasoned chopped beef -- I got this recipe from net.cooks
  in the fall of 1983. It was posted by houxm!houxz!llf.
  
  *  Picadillo is a great favorite throughout Latin America, and every
  country has its own version. In Mexico it is much appreciated as a filling
  for tacos, empanadas, tamales and green peppers. In the north of the
  country it is popular on its own and is eaten as a main dish, accompanied
  by rice, beans, guacamole and tortillas.
  
  *  Variations:  Instead of oregano and thyme, use a pinch or two of
  cinnamon and ground cloves. This makes an interesting difference in flavor,
  giving the dish an almost Middle Eastern taste.
  
  *  In Chihuahua, the apple is left out and 4 medium potatoes, cooked and
  cubed, and about 2 C cooked green peas are added to the beef at the end of
  the cooking time for just long enough to heat them through. This makes a
  nice one-dish meal.
  
  *  Picadillo de la Costa from the state of Guerrero, best known for the
  beach resort of Acapulco, uses the tropical fruits in which the region
  abounds, and instead of beef uses an equal mixture of ground pork and veal.
  The method is the same but the meats, with the onion, garlic, tomatoes, hot
  peppers, salt and pepper, are cooked, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Then add
  about 1 1/2 C pineapple chunks, 2 pears (peeled, cored and cut in chunks)
  and 2 bananas (peeled and sliced) are added and the mixture simmered for 15
  minutes longer over low heat. Sprinkle with almonds just before serving.
  This is a delicious summer dish, good with plain rice.
  
  *  In addition to the almonds, I add fresh coriander leaves as a garnish.

      3 C  Potato (raw),                       1    Garlic clove, crushed
           -packed, grated                          -(or more to taste)
           -(about 3 large potatoes)           1    Broccoli bunch, broken
      1 t  Salt                                     -into small florets
      4    Eggs                              1/2 t  Basil, dried
  1 1/4 C  Onion, grated                            Thyme
           -(or more to taste)                 2 C  Cheddar cheese, grated
      2 T  Oil                                 1 C  Milk
      3 T  Butter                                   Paprika
 
  Drain the potatoes and squeeze dry.  Add about 1/2 t salt, 1 egg and about
  1/4 cup (or more to taste) grated onion. Pat potato mixture into well-oiled
  10-inch pie pan and bake at 400 degrees F. for 30 minutes.  Brush potato
  crust with oil, reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F. and bake for
  another 5-10 minutes, until crust is brown.
  
  While crust is baking, saute about 1 cup chopped onion and garlic in
  butter. If you like a lot of onion and garlic, use more. Add broccoli,
  about 1/2 t salt, basil, a dash of thyme, and cook covered, stirring
  occasionally, for a few minutes.
  
  Spread half of cheese over baked crust.  Top with sauteed vegetables and
  remaining cheese.
  
  Beat together remaining 3 eggs and milk,  and pour over vegetable/cheese
  mixture.  Sprinkle paprika on top.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 35 to 40
  minutes until custard is set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A wonderful vegetable pie -- This recipe is originally from the _Los
  Angeles Times_.  It takes a lot of time to make, but it's quite good.
  Yield: serves 3-4.
  
  *  This recipe can be made in two stages:  you can make the crust in
  advance and then can make the vegetable topping and bake it later.
  
  *  An electric grater is a real time-saver for the crust ingredients.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.

      Yield: 1 pie
 
      1    Pie shell (make your own,       2 1/2 t  Cornstarch
           -or buy the frozen,                10 C  Fruit, sliced
           -uncooked kind)                          Cinnamon or nutmeg,
    1/2 C  Water                                    -ground (to taste)
      1 C  Sugar                          
 
  Mash about 2 C of the fruit in a saucepan with the water, sugar, and
  cornstarch.  Add another sprinkle of nutmeg or cinnamon.  Boil until the
  liquid becomes clear (about two minutes).
  
  Place the remaining fruit in the pie shell, and a sprinkle of the nutmeg or
  cinnamon.  Pour the hot mixture over the fruit, and let cool for at least
  two hours.
  
  Serve with whipped cream or ice cream as desired.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick fruit tart pie -- This is just about the ideal way to use up any

      Title: HALVAS POLITIKOS
 Categories: Desserts, Greek, Usenet
      Yield: 1 dessert
 
      1 C  Olive oil                           4 C  Water
      2 C  Semolina                                 Cinnamon, powdered
      3 C  Sugar                          
 
  Dissolve the sugar in the water and bring it to a boil.  At the same time,
  brown the semolina in the oil on high heat, stirring continuously.
  
  When the semolina has taken a golden brown colour, add the syrup into it
  (taking care not to burn your hands), turn down the heat and keep stirring
  until you get a kind of thick porridge.  Pour into any kind of mold you can
  think of (a cake-mold is perfect for the job), and let it cool.
  
  Unmold into a platter and sprinkle with cinnamon.  Slice it using a wet
  knife, serve, and watch your weight go sky high!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Greek dessert with semolina -- This is a traditional greek dessert
  that is extremely about tasty, and as easy to make as 1-2-3-4. Tasty.
  Yield: fills a cake-mold.
  
  *  You should be very careful pouring the syrup into the browned semolina,
  as it is extremely hot, and pouring water on it causes an eruption of
  scaldingly hot steam.
  
  *  You should not put this dessert in the refrigerator.  It can keep for a
  few days outside the refrigerator, assuming you can gather enough will
  power not to eat it all at once. Some oil will start to drain off after a
  day or so, but this is to be expected. Just make sure you don't leave the
  dessert on your favourite tablecloth!
  
  *  The recipe doubles, halves etc.  nicely as long as you keep the
  proportion of the ingredients.
  
  *  I have seen variations on this dessert using any kind of fat imaginable,
  ranging from cooking fat to olive oil or butter, though I've only tried it
  with olive oil.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15-20 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients, except for the sugar which you can
  adjust to taste.

      Title: MARGARET RUDKIN'S BREAD STUFFING
 Categories: Entrees, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Bread                                    Pepper, freshly ground
      1    White onion,                      1/2 t  Sage
           -chopped fine                     1/2 t  Thyme
      1 t  Salt                              1/4 lb Butter, melted
 
  On the weekend before Thanksgiving, set aside some homemade bread, to dry
  out. Leave it unwrapped so that it will dry thoroughly.
  
  Thanksgiving morning, cut the bread into thick slices and remove the crust
  from each slice.  Dip each slice into cold water, and wring out carefully.
  After squeezing each slice dry, crumble it into a large bowl by rubbing
  between your hands.
  
  Add salt, pepper, sage, thyme and chopped onion to the bowl, and stir
  gently. Pour on the melted butter and toss like a salad.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A stuffing recipe from the founder of Pepperidge Farm Margaret Rudkin
  founded the Pepperidge Farm bakery as a health-food venture in 1937 because
  one of her children was allergic to white bread.  Her family lived on a
  farm in Connecticut that had a lot of pretty sorghum trees that the locals
  called "pepperidge trees," hence the name. Rudkin's pediatrician asked to
  buy loaves of her whole-grain bread for other children with white-flour
  allergies, and so the business was started. If you look in cookbooks
  published in that era, they mostly say that it is impossible to make bread
  from whole grains because the flour was too coarse and the bread would not
  hold together.  In its time, this was a very risky venture.
  
  In 1963, Margaret Rudkin published a cookbook with all of her family
  recipes. It's called "The Margaret Rudkin Pepperidge Farm Cookbook,"
  (Atheneum Press). It is a rare book, and has been out of print for 20
  years.  In 1965 Grosset and Dunlap republished it with much wider
  distribution, but that book is also out of print.
  
  In general I have found that the recipes in this book are nearly identical
  to the products sold by the Pepperidge Farm bakery, and it's a lot of fun
  to make your own. Here is her recipe for Thanksgiving turkey stuffing.
  
  *  Rudkin's notes say "taste and sniff as you go, because you might like
  more sage or thyme."

      Title: GRANDMA MACKAY'S CRANBERRY BREAD
 Categories: Quick bread, Usenet
      Yield: 2 loaves
 
      2 C  Flour, all-purpose                  1 T  Orange peel, grated
      1 C  Sugar, granulated                        -(one large orange)
  1 1/2 t  Baking powder                       1    Egg, beaten
    1/2 t  Baking soda                         1 C  Cranberries, halved
      1 t  Salt                                     -or chopped
    3/4 C  Orange juice (juice                 1 C  Walnuts or pecans,
           -of one large orange)                    -chopped
      2 T  Shortening            
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease the bottom, but not the sides, of
  two small loaf pans.
  
  In a large bowl, sift together all the dry ingredients (flour, sugar,
  baking powder, baking soda and salt). Blend very well.
  
  Mix together the orange juice, orange peel, melted shortening and beaten
  egg. Mix only enough to blend uniformly. Mix in the cranberries and the
  nuts; stir gently. Pour the mixture into the loaf pans. Push it to the
  corners, leaving the center slightly hollow.
  
  Bake about an hour at 350 degrees F.  The loaves are done when a toothpick
  inserted in the middle comes out clean.  Cool completely before cutting. Do
  not try to serve warm.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A festive cranberry-orange nut-bread -- My grandmother MacKay clipped
  this recipe from the 1951 edition of the Pillsbury Bake-Off competition
  recipes, and we've made it a family tradition ever since. From time to time
  my mother and I have both tried to improve on the recipe, but it appears
  that the recipe is already perfect; every variation we have ever tried has
  been disappointing by comparison.
  
  When I was a boy, before the invention of the food processor, making this
  bread required cutting the cranberries in half by hand, with a knife, and
  the person who brought 4 loaves of cranberry bread to the family
  Thanksgiving meal was more welcome than the person who brought the turkey.
  Now, between Baker's Secret loaf pans and Cuisinart slicer blades, you can
  knock out 8 perfect loaves of the stuff while watching one episode of
  Sesame Street.  My grandmother still cuts each cranberry in half with a
  paring knife, and hers still tastes better than mine. Yield: 2 small
  loaves.
  
  *  It takes practice to know when to stop mixing the dough.  If you mix too
  much, the bread gets a chewy texture to it, whereas it should have a very
  crumbly consistency, like a muffin or cornbread.
  
  *  It really makes a difference in the texture of this bread to use a
  shortening that is solid at room temperature, like Crisco.  It really makes
  a difference in the flavor to use fresh orange-peel and not powdered. I
  prefer walnuts to pecans.
  
  *  It might seem sensible to try to use the same orange for the peel and
  the juice, but it is really more trouble than it is worth to try to peel a
  juiced orange or juice a peeled orange. I usually use two oranges and eat
  the one that I took the peel from.
  
  *  This bread keeps well in the freezer.  Specifically, it keeps from
  Thanksgiving to Christmas.  It also survives quite well being mailed by

      Title: THANKSGIVING PIE
 Categories: Pies, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 1 pie
 
      1    Pie crust (deep dish),            1/4 C  Butter, melted
           -unbaked                                 -(or margarine)
      3    Eggs                                1 C  Pumpkin
      1 C  Corn syrup, dark                    1 t  Vanilla
  1 1/2 C  Sugar                               1 C  Pecan halves
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Beat eggs.  Add other ingredients except
  pecans and beat well.  Put pecans in bottom of pie crust and slowly pour
  egg mixture over nuts. Bake 45 minutes, or until knife inserted one inch
  from edges comes out clean. Let pie cool (if cut warm, the pie will be
  runny) Serve with whipped cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich pie with pumpkin and pecans -- I've been cooking this recipe for
  a few years, and my people love it. It combines the best of the flavors of
  pumpkin and pecan.  Yield:  1 9-inch pie.
  
  *  You can use chopped pecans, but pecan halves are prettier.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: CRANBERRY-ORANGE RELISH
 Categories: Relishes, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 4 cups
 
      1 lb Cranberries, raw                    3    Oranges, seeded,
           Cane sugar                               -but not peeled
 
  Grind up coarsely in your meat grinder or food processor the cranberries
  and oranges. Sweeten to taste with sugar.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A fruit relish for holiday dinners -- In Chicago, where I did much of my
  growing up, there was a company called Indian Trails that made a frozen
  cranberry relish, and their relish was traditional at my family's
  Thanksgiving dinner. When I moved to Boston I missed it. So I determined
  when next I went back to find a package of Indian Trails, read the label
  carefully, and duplicate the ingredients.
  
  Alas, the company had gone bankrupt in my absence and there were no
  packages anywhere in any reputable store. But I knew about the disreputable
  stores as well, so I took myself over to 47th Street and sure enough there
  in the frozen foods section I found a pink-marbled, faintly sticky package
  of Indian Trails cranberry relish, undoubtedly thawed out and re-frozen at
  least a dozen times.
  
  Eagerly I snatched it up, eagerly I read the mysterious ingredients:
  cranberries, oranges, sugar.  (This was before the days when they would
  have boasted No preservatives! No artificial ingredients!) I returned to
  Boston. I tried it: cranberries, oranges, sugar. Based on the original
  experience with Indian Trails, I assume my home-made version would freeze
  admirably.
  
  One year, in a restless fit, I added a little powdered cinnamon, but that
  was silly, and I'm ashamed of myself now.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

      Title: CRANBERRY SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1 lb Cranberries                         1 C  Sugar
           Water                          
 
  Rinse the cranberries and put them into a heavy pot.  Add just enough water
  to cover them. Stir in the sugar.
  
  Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until most of the cranberries
  have split open. This will take about 15 minutes. Stir well, then taste it,
  and add more sugar if it's not sweet enough for you. If you add more sugar,
  cook it a little longer, still stirring, to make sure that the new sugar is
  completely dissolved.  Chill overnight.  Eat.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Homemade cranberry sauce -- Most people don't realize how easy it is to
  make cranberry sauce.  It tastes much better fresh than canned (what
  doesn't?).  Yield:  Makes a lot.
  
  *  This keeps covered in the refrigerator for quite a long time.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, overnight chilling.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: PAUPIETTES DE BANANES AUX JAMBON
 Categories: Appetizers, French, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Bananas (fairly unripe,           1/2 C  Double cream
           -but not green)                          -(whipping cream)
      4 sl Ham                                      Paprika
      6 T  Parmesan cheese, grated                  Salt and pepper
 
  Peel bananas, sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika (be generous with
  this). Wrap a slice of ham around each banana. Place bananas in a greased,
  oven-proof dish and pour cream over them.  Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on
  top.  Bake at 400 degrees F. for 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve
  cold (but not refrigerated).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Bananas with ham and paprika -- This comes from the "Vogue French
  Cookery Book." It seems to go down rather well as an appetizer, although it
  would make a nice supper snack, I suppose.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SOUR CUCUMBER PICKLES
 Categories: Pickles, Usenet
      Yield: 4 cups
 
      4 C  Cucumbers (small)                 1/8 t  Alum
      4 t  Sugar                                    Cider vinegar
      2 t  Canning/pickling salt                    Water
      2 t  Mustard, dry                   
 
  Wash cucumbers in cool water and pack into a canning jar big enough to hold
  them.  Add sugar, salt, dry mustard and alum.  Fill jar about 2/3 full with
  vinegar.  Fill remaining portion of jar to cover cucumbers with water.  Put
  lid on jar.
  
  Agitate lightly every day for about a week to mix spices in with cucumbers.
  Then put in a cool dark place for about 3 months while the cucumbers work.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  The most lip smackin' pickles you ever tasted, this recipe came from my
  wife's grandmother.
  
  *  Don't be too impatient to try the pickles.  They taste terrible if they
  haven't worked.  Also, you do not have to seal these jars.  They will keep
  for quite some time if stored in a cool/dark location.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 3 months waiting.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: ENCHILADAS SABROSAS
 Categories: Meats, Latin, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Ground meat (mixed                1/2 C  Wine or sherry
           -ground beef and                  3/4 C  Black olives
           -ground pork)                   1 1/2 C  Enchilada sauce
      1 md Onion                             1/2 C  Tomato sauce
    1/2    Green pepper                             -(1 small can)
      5    Garlic cloves                      12    Corn tortillas
      1    Cilantro bunch                    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese
    1/2 t  Red pepper                        1/2 C  Sour cream (optional)
    1/2 t  Salt                                     Oil
    1/2 t  Cumin (or more)                
 
  Chop onion and garlic; place them in a frying pan with the ground meats.
  Saute them without adding fat.  When meat is brown, add the chopped green
  pepper and most of the cilantro leaves and cook for another minute or two
  (until green pepper is cooked bright green).  Drain well, then add (about)
  several tablespoons of the enchilada sauce and cook for a few minutes
  longer. Set aside.
  
  Make the sauce:  into a saucepan, pour the remaining enchilada sauce (from
  the can). Add the can of tomato sauce. Add the wine or sherry, cumin, salt,
  red pepper, and cook for 10-30 minutes (depending on how compulsive you
  are). The flavor should be smooth (not gritty) and spicy.
  
  Collect together everything that you will need for assembling the
  enchiladas. Grate the cheese onto wax paper. Have the olives handy (you'll
  be cutting them in half). Lightly oil the baking dish.
  
  The frying pan from which you drained the meat mixture still has some of
  its grease left in it. Take 4 tortillas from their package, separate them
  from each other, then one-by-one, slide them over the frying pan surface on
  each side, to moisten them slightly with the grease. That done, stack them
  in the frying pan and heat them until they are soft and pliable.
  
  The final  assembly requires a bit of manual dexterity and speed:  Take the
  tortillas, and place them (bumpy side out) in the oven  dish, curved into a
  "U" shape, each right next to its neighbor.  (At this point, start heating
  your  next 4 tortillas in the frying pan.  I usually wind up preparing 10
  tortillas in all.)
  
  Place a small handful of cheese into the U of each tortilla, followed by an
  appropriate amount of meat mixture, and finally several olive halves.  Then
  curl one end of the tortilla around to tuck into the opposite end, and
  carefully rotate it to conceal the seam.  Each tortilla should be filled
  firmly (not too loosely) but not overflowing the ends.
  
  Once all the filling is used up and the enchiladas are now filled
  tortillas, pour the sauce over the top, helping it run into all the
  crevices. Sprinkle lightly with remaining cilantro leaves. 10 Cover with
  aluminum foil and bake for 20-30 minutes, just until the tortillas are soft
  and the sauce is slightly bubbly. Let sit for 5 minutes, then serve, topped
  with a dollop of sour cream. If you fail to drain the meat well enough, the
  enchiladas will be greasy. If over-baked, it tastes all right, but the
  tortillas lose their texture. In general, however, the recipe is quite
  forgiving in its proportions. Feel free to adjust the seasoning to your own
  tolerance for hot spice. I like to assemble this recipe at least 3 hours
  before baking to give the flavors a chance to blend. Left refrigerated for
  a day, the seasoning is even less aggressive. Served with a salad (and some
  Mexican beer), it's a complete meal.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Enchiladas with meat, black olives and cheese -- For many years, I've
  been involved in Latin American "solidarity work" here in the San Francisco
  area, and as a result, I have learned some of its culinary pleasures. This
  recipe originated from the back of a can of enchilada sauce in Mexico, but
  was refined by a special Chilean refugee friend who won a scholarship to
  the California Culinary Academy (in San Francisco) and now cooks
  ever-so-lusciously.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 30 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK, but time the baking carefully.

      Title: APRICOT CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Chicken pieces                  1 1/2 lb Apricot halves (canned)
      1 pk French onion soup mix                    Flour (plain)
      2 C  Apricot nectar                 
 
  Dust chicken in flour.  Fry chicken lightly until starting to brown.  Place
  chicken in a casserole dish or a very deep frying pan.  Add soup powder,
  nectar and apricots.  Mix everything well.  Simmer for 1 hour.
  
  I normally use 2 pieces of chicken per person and about a 1 1/2 lb can of
  apricot halves.  This will suffice for 4 to 6 people.  If you cannot get
  nectar, then use the juice from the apricot halves.  (Of course, if you can
  buy apricots in nectar...)
  
  The French onion soup quantity is not critical, but a soup packet that
  makes up about 6 C is about right for 4 to 6 people. Serve with potato
  (baked or boiled), buttered carrots and peas.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken embalmed in apricot nectar -- Apricot Chicken is the ultimate
  bachelors delight.  It is very simple and tastes wonderful.  The recipe was
  given to me by a group of friends from back home who came to visit me.
  Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      2    Eggs (separated)                    2 T  Butter
      2 C  Milk                              1/4 C  Sugar, white
 
  Mix flour and brown sugar, adding beaten egg yolks and milk gradually. Put
  on to boil and thicken, stir constantly. Take off heat. Add butter and mix
  well.  Pour into buttered pie dish.
  
  Beat egg whites with white sugar until meringue consistency and pile on
  top. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 340 degrees F. until meringue is nicely
  brown.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Butterscotch pudding with a meringue top -- A delicious dessert for the
  sugar addict.  It goes well with apricot chicken.  This is one of the
  family favourites that mum makes.
  
  *  It is very important not to let the oven get too hot!

      Title: MARGO'S LAMB STEW
 Categories: Meats, Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 T  Olive oil                                Lemon juice
      1 lg Onion (thinly sliced)               1 T  Hungarian paprika
      4    Garlic cloves, minced               1 t  Celery salt
      3 lb Lamb cut into                     1/2 t  Cumin, ground
           -stew-sized cubes and             1/8 t  Cayenne
           -carefully trimmed of fat           1 ds Allspice
      4 lb Tomatoes, cooked                    1 ds Cinnamon, ground
           -(2 large cans)                 1 1/2 lb Green beans, fresh,
      3    Bay leaves                               -washed and trimmed
 
  In a steeped, saute onion in olive oil on medium-low heat until golden
  brown. Add garlic in the last 2-3 minutes. Add lamb cubes and saute until
  brown. Add tomatoes and simmer until meat is tender. Keep an eye on the
  liquid; add water or red wine if it becomes dry.
  
  Add bay leaves, lemon juice and spices.  Simmer on low heat for at least 2
  hours.  About 1/2 hour before pronouncing it done, add the green beans.
  Serve with plain yogurt and pita bread.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fragrant lamb stew -- This recipe comes from Margo Kaiser, with whom I
  used to work. It's a delicious stew, spiced fragrantly but not hot. It's
  one of my favorites. It's also very easy. The most tedious work is trimming
  the lamb, and you can get the butcher to take care of that.
  
  The spice mixture is my attempt to re-create Margo's "secret spice" (she
  didn't offer that recipe).  Feel free to try your own variations.  If you
  hit on one that you feel is particularly good, please let me know about it.
  Yield:  serves 6 to 8.
  
  *  I prefer to cook to the point of simmering, refrigerate overnight, and
  then finish cooking the next evening. This greatly enhances the flavor.
  When you take the stew from the refrigerator, skim any lamb fat that has
  congealed on the top before continuing.
  
  *  I find that many butchers don't understand that I want good quality meat
  in stews. I get better quality, more carefully trimmed meat by telling them
  that I want lamb cubes cut for shish kebab.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 20 cups
 
      1 lb Beef soup bones                     2 sm Carrots
           -(as meaty as possible;           1/2 lb Green peas, unshelled
           -meaty neck or cross-cut            1    Ear corn, fresh
           -shank bones are good)              3    Bay leaves
     12 C  Water                               5 T  Basil, dried (or
      1 lg Onion, quartered                         -1/2 cup fresh, chopped)
           -(don't use instant)                2 T  Oregano, dried
      2 lb Cooking tomatoes                         -(or 2-4 T fresh, chopped)
           -(peeled), whole                    1 T  Thyme, dried (or 2 T
           -(2 large cans)                          -fresh, chopped)
    1/4 lb Green beans, fresh                       Salt and pepper
 
  In a large, heavy pot, bring about 12 C of water to boil.  Add beef bones,
  cover and bring back to full boil.  Reduce heat to low simmer.  Skim
  occasionally during first 30 minutes to remove scum.  Cook for 3-4 hours
  until meat is tender and nearly falls off of bones.
  
  Remove bones from broth.  Remove all meat and marrow from bones and return
  to the pot. Add tomatoes (including juice), onion and herbs. Simmer for 20
  minutes.  Remove tomatoes, break up into quarters or smaller, and return to
  the pot.  Continue to simmer.
  
  Clean green beans and break into pieces.  Clean carrots and slice into thin
  slices.  Slice kernels from ear of corn.  Shell peas.  Add vegetables to
  pot. Simmer for 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A thick and hearty vegetable beef soup, this soup is almost thick enough
  to be called a stew. It is great on a cold day or after skiing.
  
  *  I prefer beef neck or shank bones over what markets call "soup bones"
  which are nearly devoid of meat. Individual-serving size cans of green
  beans, corn and green peas may be substituted if fresh vegetables are not
  available. These are the basic vegetables I use, but I have also added
  mustard greens, chinese cabbage, zucchini and yellow squash (add just 5
  minutes before serving or they become mush) turnips and any other
  fall/winter vegetables that look good in the market. Serve with cornbread,
  sourdough or another strong flavored bread. This soup improves with age.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  Several hours of intermittent attention.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SPINACH CASSEROLE
 Categories: Casseroles, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     10 oz Spinach, chopped                    2 T  Flour
           -(frozen or fresh)                       Cheddar or parmesan cheese
      2 T  Butter (or margarine)                    -(between 1-2 C), grated
      1 sm Onion, chopped                           Salt
           Yogurt, plain                            Pepper
           -(between 1-2 C)                  
 
  Rinse and chop the spinach.  Place the chopped spinach in a heavy skillet,
  cover, and steam until wilted, stirring occasionally.  There is no need to
  add water other than what clings to the leaves from washing. (If you are
  using frozen spinach, place over low or medium heat to thaw and allow
  excess water to evaporate.) Transfer to small bowl.
  
  In a skillet, melt the butter (or margarine).  Add the onion and cook until
  soft.  Add the flour and stir for 1 minute over medium heat.  Season the
  mixture to taste with salt and pepper, and then gradually whisk in the
  yogurt.
  
  Add the spinach and turn to coat the leaves.  Remove from heat and blend in
  the cheese.  Pour into a greased 8x4-inch loaf pan, and bake for 20 minutes
  at 350 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spinach casserole with yogurt and cheese -- Here is a recipe for a
  spinach casserole that is delightfully cheesy. It might even make you love
  spinach.
  
  *  Don't skimp on the cheese, and use fresh cheese rather than pre-packaged
  grated cheese.

 Categories: Pasta, Picnic, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Chinese noodles                     2 T  Sugar
           -(fresh)                        1 1/2 t  Salt
      4    Scallions (or green               1/2 t  Black pepper
           -onions), chopped                        -(fresh ground)
      2 t  Chili oil                           1 t  MSG (optional)
      2 t  Sesame seed oil                     2    Red peppers (fresh),
      2 T  Vinegar                                  -chopped
 
  Cook the noodles in boiling water for 3 minutes, then drain.  Rinse them in
  cold water until they are cool, then set aside to drain.
  
  Make the sauce by mixing together all of the other ingredients.  Heat about
  4 T oil in a wok. When it is hot, pour in the sauce mixture, and then the
  noodles.  Stir well to cover the noodles with sauce, then remove and cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Easy, spicy-hot cold noodles for summer -- This recipe is an easy
  prepare-ahead dish for a hot summer day.  It makes a good barbecue side
  dish for all of us who are tired of potato salads. Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  You can serve this dish warm if you want, but it is better when cold. It
  is a good dish to prepare the previous day and leave in the refrigerator
  overnight.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes to prepare, 2 or more hours chilling.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: FRANK AND VEGETABLE CASSEROLE
 Categories: Casseroles, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Frankfurters, boiled               20 oz Cauliflower (frozen),
           -(I use Armour                           -cooked
           -All-Beef franks)                   6 lg Potatoes, diced
     20 oz Broccoli spears                          -and cooked (approx.)
           -(frozen), cooked                   1 lb Cheddar cheese, sliced
     12 oz Corn (canned), drained          
 
  Thinly slice franks (18-20 slices per frank).  Break cauliflower into bite
  sized florets.  Separate broccoli into individual spears.
  
  Combine all franks and vegetables in a 6-8 quart pot and mix well.  Spread
  into baking pan(s).  (I use 2 9x9 baking pans.)  Cover ingredients with a
  layer of sliced cheese.

  until cheese melts.  If coming from refrigerator, cook covered at 350
  degrees F. for 30-35 minutes, then uncovered for 10-15 minutes until cheese
  melts and ingredients are evenly warmed.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Casserole with frankfurters, vegetables and cheese.
  
  *  As a variation, cube half of the cheese and mix in with the vegetables,
  then top with remaining sliced cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes cooking, 15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SPICY PEANUT SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Usenet
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      1 T  Garlic powder                       2 T  Chili pepper,
      1 T  Onion powder                             -ground [see notes]
      2 C  Water                               5 T  Peanut butter
      1 T  Oil                                 1 T  Soy sauce
    1/4 C  Onion, diced                  

--------------------------------CHOOSE ONE:--------------------------------
      8 oz Soy and rice tempeh,                     -cut into 1/4-inch cubes
           -cut into 1/4-inch cubes            1 lb Tofu cut into
      3    Boneless chicken breasts,                -1/4-inch cubes
 
  Combine the garlic powder, onion powder, water and (tempeh/chicken/tofu) in
  a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the
  (tempeh/chicken/tofu).  Drain and save the cooking liquid.
  
  Heat the oil in the saucepan and saute the onion and chili until soft. Mix
  in the cooking liquid, peanut butter and soy sauce. Bring to a boil. Add
  the (tempeh/chicken/tofu) and mix until coated with sauce. Serve over hot
  noodles or rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spicy peanut sauce for chicken, tempeh, or tofu -- My wife and I got
  this recipe from the back of a package of Tempeh. We have successfully used
  it with chicken chunks also; in fact, we prefer it that way. Yield: Serves
  3 or 4.
  
  *  This recipe, if made as suggested, can be very spicy.  We normally cut
  the amount of chili powder by half, although that is personal preference.
  Experiment with it.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes.

      Title: EGG MOUSSE
 Categories: Appetizers, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Eggs, hard-boiled                   5 oz Chicken stock
      1 t  Gelatine                            1 C  Cream, whipped
      1 T  Worcestershire sauce                     Paprika
      2 t  Anchovy essence                          Salt
 
  Finely chop the egg whites.  Sieve the egg yolks.
  
  Add gelatine to chicken stock and heat until it dissolves.  Cool and allow
  mixture to begin to set.  Put stock and seasoning into whipped cream. Fold
  in yolks and whites, place in dish and chill. Decorate and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple appetizer for summer days -- This dish was served at a dinner I
  was invited to at the Vice-Chancellor's Lodge at the University of
  Liverpool when I was a student. Mrs. Whelan, the VC's wife, gave me the
  recipe later.
  
  *  A nice way to decorate is to peel some white grapes and chill.  Then
  before serving spread thinly a little caviar on top and place halved grapes
  on top of that.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
  : Precision:  Measure gelatine and stock.

      Title: AYALLA'S BANANA BREAD
 Categories: Quick bread, Usenet
      Yield: 1 loaf
 
      3    Bananas, very ripe                  2 C  Flour
      1 C  Sugar                               1 t  Baking soda
    1/2 C  Shortening (butter)                 1 C  Walnuts, chopped
      2    Eggs                                     Rum, vanilla, or amaretto
      3 T  Yoghurt or sour cream                    -(optional)
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream the shortening and sugar.  Mix in
  the bananas.  Mix in the remaining ingredients.  Pour into a greased loaf
  pan. Bake 1 hour 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This recipe is from my friend Ayalla -- It makes a heavy, but moist,
  loaf of banana bread.
  
  *  If you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, I suggest that you lower the
  oven temperature and cook for a while longer.  Otherwise, the crust comes
  out almost overcooked while the middle remains moist and almost
  undercooked.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  Preparation:  10 minutes; baking:  at least 95 minutes.  Allow
  some time for cooling.

      2    Bananas (or equivalent                   Broken meringue
 
  Whip the cream.  Chop fruit coarsely, but don't crush.  Break meringue into
  large crumbs.  Mix everything shortly before serving and pile into glasses.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple dessert for failed Pavlova attempts -- My mother used to make the
  banana variety of this when she cooked her meringues a little too long or
  too hot. I've no idea of its origins.
  
  *  I can never make up my mind whether I prefer the strawberry or the
  banana version. Peach should be pretty good too, though I've never tried
  it.
  
  *  This is a neat way of saving a Pavlova attempt when the meringue part
  fails:  it produces a delicious desert and no-one need ever know...
  
  : Difficulty:  very simple.
  : Time:  10 minutes presuming you have the meringue available.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: PECAN PRALINES
 Categories: Candy, Southwest, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1 C  Milk                                3 T  Corn syrup, dark
      1 C  Sugar, granulated                   8 oz Pecan halves
      1 C  Dark brown sugar,                 3/4 C  Water, boiling
           -firmly packed                     24    Cupcake papers
      1 t  Vanilla extract                
 
  Place the white sugar, brown sugar, milk and corn syrup in a heavy about
  3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir to thoroughly dissolve.
  
  Measuring the temperature with a candy thermometer, stir constantly with a
  long-handled wooden spoon.  When the mixture reaches "jelly" temperature on
  the thermometer (220 degrees), it will bubble furiously.  Splattering is a
  danger (this is why you want a spoon with a long handle).  You may wish to
  wear heavy rubber gloves for further protection.  Continue stirring until
  mixture reaches 256 degrees ("medium-ball" stage).
  
  Remove from heat, add vanilla and let it sit for 10 minutes.  During this
  time, set out the cupcake papers on the countertop and place 3-4 pecan
  halves in each paper.
  
  Beat the mixture by hand with the wooden spoon, while it is still in the
  pan, until it loses its glossy sheen. This can take up to 10 minutes or
  more, and calls for a strong arm.
  
  At this point, the mixture will very quickly begin to form lumps and harden
  in the pan. As this begins to happen, return the pan to low heat; add
  boiling hot water a tablespoon at a time, and beat out the lumps until
  nearly all are gone. Add just enough water so that the mixture is somewhat
  runny and has lost much of its previous lumpy consistency (no more than
  about     3/4 cup of water, and often much less.) Leaving a few lumps is
  permissible and often unavoidable.
  
  Remove from heat and spoon it into the cupcake papers.  Let it harden for
  20-30 minutes, then remove papers.  Be sure not to let the papers remain on
  after the candy has hardened somewhat or they will be difficult to remove
  later.
  
  Store the pralines in an airtight container.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *   Texas-style creamy pecan cookies -- My family is from Texas, and we
  dearly love "authentic" Mexican food. Authentic as defined by my father:
  home-style Tex-Mex. (On a trip to Acapulco, he complained that he couldn't
  find any real Mexican food in the whole damn town.)
  
  We feel that the perfect ending to an orgy of tacos, enchiladas, tamales,
  beans, rice and Dos Equis beer is pralines.  However, we have been
  consistently disappointed by the pralines served at restaurants.  They are
  always either crystalline and crunchy, or sticky like undercooked taffy.
  Both are equally unacceptable.
  
  At the age of 10, I decided to try my hand at making pralines, and happened
  on a recipe in a current (1958) issue of _The Ladies Home Journal_, which I
  accidently adapted to make the perfect praline, not gooey, not crunchy, but
  of a solid consistency that becomes creamy in texture as it is eaten. The
  secret is to first screw up the recipe (at this point you are tempted to
  throw the whole thing out, including the pot) and then rectify the mistake
  into a wonderfully sinful sugary concoction. Now, no Mexican dinner or
  Christmas candy plate at our house is complete without them. Yield: Makes
  16-24.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  30 minutes cooking, 30 minutes cooling.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients and the temperatures.

      Title: SWEDISH RYE BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Swedish, Usenet
      Yield: 3 loaves
 
      2 C  Milk                                3 C  Flour, white (approx)
      1 C  Water                             1/2 C  Sugar, granulated
    1/2 C  Brown sugar                       1/2 C  Vegetable oil
    1/2 oz Dry yeast                         1/4 C  Dark molasses
           -(two packages)                     2 t  Anise seeds, crushed
      6 C  Rye flour (approx)                  1 t  Salt
 
  Scald the milk and combine it with the water and brown sugar in a very
  large bowl. (You need something that holds at least 4 or 5 quarts.) When
  the mixture is lukewarm, dissolve the yeast in it, then stir in about 2
  cups rye flour and about 1 cup white flour to make a paste.
  
  Let the mixture rise in a warm place until it is light and foamy.  This
  usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour.  Check it frequently, it can
  really make a mess if it rises enough to overflow the bowl. (I'm sure they
  could make a great horror movie about a gigantic blob of bread dough that
  keeps getting bigger and bigger as it consumes everything in its path....)
  
  Stir in the granulated sugar, oil, molasses, anise seed and salt, and
  enough flour to make a stiff dough, using 2 parts rye to 1 part white.
  Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic,
  adding more flour to keep it from sticking to your hands.
  
  Clean and grease the bowl.  Put the dough in the bowl, turning it to grease
  all sides.  Cover the bowl loosely with a clean towel and let the dough
  rise until it's doubled in bulk. Punch it down and let rise until double
  again.
  
  Divide the dough into three loaves and put in greased pans.  (I usually
  make round loaves and bake them on cookie sheets.) Cover with the towel and
  let rise until double again.
  
  Bake for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees F.  Because of the high sugar
  content, this bread can burn rather easily; watch it closely so it doesn't
  get too dark.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A sweet, dark whole-grain rye bread -- This recipe comes from my
  great-grandmother, who emigrated from Sweden and brought this recipe with
  her. It makes a sweet, dark bread, and (like most whole-grain breads) it
  tends to be a bit heavy. Yield: Makes 3 loaves.
  
  *  Rye flour can be a little hard to find these days.  You may have to
  visit a store that specializes in natural foods. Avoid the kind that is
  very coarsely ground with big chunks of bran in it, though; this doesn't
  seem to have any gluten at all in it, and since the proportion of rye flour
  is so high in this recipe, the texture of the bread will come out all
  wrong.  You need something that looks more like ordinary flour.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, several hours rising, 1 hour baking and
  cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: STUFFED CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Chicken, with giblets                    -tip of a paring knife)
    1/2 C  Rice, white (raw)                   2    Celery stalks
      1 pn Saffron (use the                   10 md Mushrooms
           -amount that sticks                 3    Scallions
           -to the first 1/2 inch              3 T  Butter
 
  Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees F.  Clean the chicken, remove any large gobs
  of fat and rinse away any residual goo from its inside.
  
  Cook the rice in 1 cup of water, along with the saffron.  Salt to taste.
  Saute the giblets in about 2 T of butter.  While these are cooking, clean
  and cut up the celery, mushrooms and scallions into small pieces.
  
  When the giblets are done, chop them well.
  
  Mix the rice, vegetables and mushrooms together in a bowl, and cram as much
  as will fit into the chicken. Tie the ends of the drumsticks and the tail
  together.  Rub about 1 T of butter over the skin of the chicken.  Place
  remaining stuffing into a glass or ceramic casserole, cover, and set aside.
  
  Place in the chicken in the oven, uncovered.  After 10 minutes, lower heat
  to 350 degrees F. The chicken should cook approximately 20 minutes per
  pound. Test the chicken by pricking it in the thickest part of the thigh;
  when it is done, only clear juices will come out. If the chicken is still
  underdone, blood will come out.
  
  Half an hour before the chicken is done, put the additional stuffing in the
  oven.
  
  If there are leftovers, be sure to remove any extra stuffing from the
  inside of the chicken, as it will sour if stored inside the bird.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Roast chicken stuffed with rice and vegetables -- This is a recipe that
  I've evolved slowly, and I think I've finally got it right.  Yield:  Serves
  2-3.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (cooking time is critical)
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  In a large bowl, combine the sugar,
  flour, sour cream, eggs and vanilla into a smooth mixture.
  
  Core, peel and chop the apples.  Boil them in a small amount of water with
  a little lemon juice for 3 to 5 minutes until they begin to get tender.
  Drain apples and add to the mixture.
  
  Pour into two 9-inch pastry shells.  Bake at 400 degrees F. for 30 minutes.
  
  While pies are baking, crumble topping ingredients into a bowl and mix with
  a pastry cutter or two knives. Remove pies from oven and cover with topping
  recipe.  Put pies under broiler for 1 to 2 minutes until the topping begins
  to bubble.
  
  Don't take your eyes off the pies while they're under the broiler.  A
  moment's inattention can mean burned pie!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Apple pie with sour cream goodness -- This recipe came from my wife's
  boss, Dick Dolan, the editor of the _Hewlett Packard Journal_. It is
  sinfully delicious and never lasts very long, even if you don't have help
  eating it!
  
  *  If there is any pie left over, the remainder should be refrigerated.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking.

 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 1 trifle
 
-----------------------------------FRUIT-----------------------------------
      3    Pears                               1    Passion fruit
      8 oz Raspberries                              Dry sherry

      Title: BO'S CHOCOLATE CHIP CHEESECAKE
 Categories: Cheesecakes, Usenet
      Yield: 1 cheesecake
 
     24 oz Cream cheese,                       1 C  Sour cream
           -broken into pieces               1/4 C  Brown sugar,
      4    Eggs, separated                          -or to taste
      2 T  Vanilla extract                     1 lb Chocolate chips
           -(do not use artificial             1 lb Graham cracker crumbs
           -vanilla)                         1/2 C  Butter, melted
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
  
  PREPARE THE BATTER:  Place the egg yolks in a food processor for 5 seconds,
  then add the cream cheese and beat until smooth.  Add the brown sugar and
  vanilla and process for several minutes, or until the batter is very
  smooth. Beat the egg whites and fold into the cheese mixture. Set aside.
  
  PREPARE THE CRUST:  Soften butter and combine with graham cracker crumbs.
  Mix until fully blended, e.g. they will form a ball when squeezed in your
  hand or by a spoon. Pat the crust into the sides and bottom of a springform
  pan about 9 inches in diameter.
  
  Spread a generous layer of chips on the bottom of the pan, and then pour
  the batter into the pan. Add another generous layer of chips to the top of
  the cake.
  
  Place the filled pan into the preheated oven.  Baking time will vary from
  about 30 minutes to 2 hours.  Cooking time depends on whether you want a
  soft, gooey "New York" style cheesecake (shorter) to a fluffy
  "souffle"-like cheesecake (longer). The longer you cook it, the fluffier it
  gets.
  
  When the cake starts to rise like a souffle, start checking to see if it is
  done.  It will just about double in volume, and should not flow over the
  sides of the pan. If the cake shimmers like Jello when shaken, it is done.
  Alternatively, if a knife inserted comes out clean, the cake is overcooked:
  the knife should be very lightly coated with batter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A truly decadent chocolate chip cheesecake -- This recipe came to me
  from a friend of mine, Bo (pronounced "boo") Ture Ahlberg, who would
  occasionally (read "whenever we could persuade him") bring it into work.
  Needless to say, it would be snarfed up immediately.
  
  *  Bo prefers to use Nestle Mini-Morsel chocolate chips.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, up to 2 hours cooking.

      Title: CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES
 Categories: Candy, Usenet
      Yield: 2 dozen
 
      1 C  Sugar                             1/2 C  Whipping cream
    3/4 C  Chocolate, powdered               1/4 C  Butter, unsalted
 
  Put all ingredients in a solid sauce-pan, mix while bringing slowly to the
  boil.  Boil gently.  After two minutes you will have a wonderful icing for
  cakes, and a sauce for ice cream.
  
  After six minutes (or a little longer if you want your truffles harder)
  take sauce-pan off heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly. At this
  point you can add dark rum or any other liqueur if you wish. Cool in the
  refrigerator for about one hour.
  
  Form into balls about the size of large marbles and roll them in powdered
  chocolate.  Cool to room temperature, or chill.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very simple chocolate truffles -- I found this recipe in the flight
  magazine for a trip from London to Vienna.  I think Vienna is probably the
  best place in the world for cakes and sweets.  Whatever you do, never go to
  Vienna if you are on a diet.  This is also the only recipe I have ever
  collected that is in cups rather than grams!  Yield:  Makes 25-30.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooling, 1 hour forming balls.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 6 dozen
 
      2 T  Butter                          1 1/2 C  Flour, plain
      1 C  Sugar                                    -(white)
      1    Egg                               1/2 t  Vanilla essence
    1/2 t  Cream of tartar                     1 C  Coconut, desiccated
      1 t  Baking soda                         2 T  Golden syrup
      1 pn Salt                                1 T  Milk
 
  Mix all ingredients together well.  Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.  Roll
  dough into small balls. Bake for 15 minutes, or until brown.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Biscuits (cookies) with butter and coconut -- This recipe is from our
  local school's collection of "mother's favourite recipes." It's terrific.
  
  *  Golden syrup is not available in North America; it is a caramelized
  sugar syrup. North Americans can substitute dark corn syrup or a mixture of
  molasses and water.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.

      Title: ZWETSCHGENDATSCHI
 Categories: Desserts, Bavarian, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch

    1/4 lb Butter                              1 pn Salt (only if you
    1/3 C  Sugar                                    -use unsalted butter)
    1/2 t  Vanilla (or use                     1 t  Lemon peel
           -vanilla sugar)                 1 3/4 C  Flour
      1    Egg                                 1 t  Baking powder
      1 T  Sour cream                          2 C  Italian plums

-------------------------OPTIONAL STREUSEL TOPPING-------------------------
      6 T  Butter                            1/3 C  Sugar
    3/4 C  Flour                             1/2 t  Cinnamon
 
  In a large bowl, cream the butter, add the sugar (and vanilla), add the
  egg, (salt,) lemon peel and sour cream. Mix the flour and baking powder and
  add that.
  
  Pit the plums, splitting them into halves or thirds.  Grease the pan and
  spread the dough.  Liberally spread plums over the dough, meat side up.  If
  the plums are sour (as opposed to just tart), sprinkle them lightly with
  sugar.
  
  To make the optional Streusel topping, cream the butter, add flour, sugar
  and cinnamon. Sprinkle over the plums. Bake for 30-45 minutes in the middle
  rack at 375 degrees F. Be careful not to let the bottom burn!
  
  Serve liberally topped with freshly-made whipping cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Bavarian plum delicacy for dessert -- My mother and grandmother make
  this Bavarian specialty without a recipe; this recipe is from my mother,
  after I pressed her to write it down so I could make my own. It also
  includes variations from a few other folks that you might like to try.
  Roughly translated from Bavarian to German, this is Pflaumenkuchen, which,
  roughly translated from German to to English is Plum cake. However,
  Zwetschgen aren't ordinary plums, a Datschi isn't really a Kuchen, and a
  Kuchen is most definitely NOT a cake!
  
  This dessert is made of the slightly tart Italian plums, which are
  unfortunately only available at certain times of the year.  Don't try to
  make it with ordinary plums; they're too sweet and too juicy. Yield: Fills
  one round cake pan.
  
  *  A Datschi may actually be made with any fruit; I happen to love it with
  Zwetschgen the best.
  
  *  I don't know this with Streusel on top, and never prepare it that way,
  but several of my acquaintances swear by it. Made with other fruit, I would
  be more likely to accept the Streusel.
  
  *  If you like, you may sprinkle rum or cinnamon over the fruit before
  baking. Also, you might try substituting rum for the sour cream in the
  dough, or just adding both.
  
  *  If you want to make a cookie-sheet-sized Datschi, simply double the
  recipe.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: FLORENTINE ZUCCOTTO
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
     10 oz Cake or lady fingers                3 C  Whipping cream
           -(can use a cake (up              1/4 C  Spirits (rum, amaretto
           -to 12 oz), such as                      -or whatever you like;
           -pound cake or sponge                    -see below for quantity)
           -cake.  If you make a                    Assorted flavorings
           -sponge cake, a 6-egg                    -(chocolate, nuts, coffee,
           -cake is about right)                    -liqueurs, extracts...)
      3 T  Sugar, powdered (or more            2 t  Gelatin, unflavored
           -or less, to taste)                      -(optional)
 
  Line a large hemispherical bowl with the cake or lady fingers.  If you use
  cake, cut slices in half diagonally to make large triangles and arrange
  them in a sunburst pattern. If you use lady fingers, cut some in half
  diagonally and arrange in a flower-like pattern. Douse generously with
  spirits; cake should be quite wet but not soggy.
  
  Dissolve the gelatin in 2 tablespoons hot water in a cup; place the cup in
  a bowl of very hot water so the gelatin melts. Check occasionally to make
  sure the surrounding water stays hot. (I suppose you could use a microwave
  for this, but I've never tried.)
  
  Divide the cream into two very cold bowls.  Whip each until stiff; if the
  flavoring for either half isn't sweet, add powdered sugar to taste at this
  point.  Beat the dissolved gelatin into the cream.  Flavor each half
  separately.  Spread one half around the inside of the cake-lined bowl; fill
  with the other half.
  
  Top with more cake and douse with more spirits.  Since this part doesn't
  show you don't need to be creative. Cover with plastic wrap and chill
  overnight.
  
  Turn out onto a platter and garnish with chopped nuts, grated chocolate, or
  powdered sugar if desired.  Cut into wedges; serves about 10-20 people
  depending.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Ladyfingers with cream and rum -- This makes a great dessert for a
  party. It only takes about an hour to make (more if you bake a cake
  yourself instead of buying one) and only requires a few seconds to get
  ready when served. Yield: Serves 10-20.
  
  *  The most recent zuccotto I made used rum to flavor the lady fingers. The
  first filling had powdered sugar, vanilla extract and about 1 1/2 oz
  chopped semi-sweet chocolate. The second had about 5 oz melted semi-sweet
  chocolate mixed with about 2 t instant coffee dissolved in a little boiling
  water, and another 1 1/2 oz chopped semi-sweet chocolate. (Just chop 3 of
  the squares of chocolate and melt the other 5). Chopped hazelnuts or
  almonds are also quite good.
  
  *  You can make a smaller one by using less, of course!
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  60 minutes preparation, overnight cooling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: YOGURT PANCAKES
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      5 lg Eggs                              1/2 C  Vegetable oil (or less
  1 1/4 C  Milk                                     -for dieters; but use
      8 oz Yogurt, plain                            -at least 2 T)
           -(I use Dannon and              2 1/3 C  Flour, white (measure
           -Knudsen; other brands                   -carefully after sifting)
           -might require different            1 T  Sugar
           -amounts)                         1/2 t  Salt
      4 t  Baking powder         
 
  Preheat griddle and oil very very lightly.  Separate the eggs; beat the
  yolks in a bowl big enough to hold the whole recipe. Add the yogurt and
  beat again; add the milk and oil and beat again. Rinse the eggbeater.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix all the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder,
  sugar and salt). Sift together. I use a flour sifter for this, but if you
  insist on measuring your flour without sifting it, then you can try using a
  wire whip to blend the dry ingredients. Using a clean eggbeater, beat the
  egg whites until they are fluffy.
  
  Dump the dry ingredient mixture into the big bowl containing the milk
  mixture, stir for about 2 seconds just to get the dry ingredients under the
  surface of the liquid, and then dump the beaten egg whites into the big
  bowl.
  
  Now beat this mixture lightly and slowly with a fork until it is more or
  less uniform. If you beat too much, or too fast, then it will get gummy.
  Don't try to get rid of lumps. Cook on the hot griddle.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Amazingly good baking-powder and yogurt pancakes -- Cooks like to show
  off by making fancy glamorous recipes to serve to their friends by candle
  light. Here is a simple ordinary recipe to serve to your family for
  breakfast in the morning.
  
  I love pancakes and I make many varieties and I am an inveterate
  experimenter. This recipe is the one I have developed over the years to
  replace buttermilk pancakes because I never have buttermilk on hand in the
  refrigerator like my grandmother did. I made this recipe this very morning
  with blueberries in it. I do have yogurt in my fridge, though, and the
  yogurt can substitute for the buttermilk. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  I like to put fresh blueberries in these pancakes after I pour them on
  the griddle. Make sure that your maple syrup is hot and that your butter is
  soft. You can heat syrup in the microwave or you can heat it by sticking
  the syrup jar in a pan of boiling water.
  
  *  This same recipe also makes really good waffles if you reduce the milk
  to about 1 cup, but if you are going to make waffles, you shouldn't cut
  back on the oil. If you are dieting, stick to pancakes.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes plus cooking time.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

  Break up the egg in a separate bowl.  Add broken egg to dry ingredients,
  mix well until it starts to form a lump. If it is s not sticking together,
  add a little milk (it should be moister than pastry but should not be
  soggy)
  
  Roll out on a floured board to about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.  Cut into
  rounds using a biscuit cutter.
  
  Heat "pan" (see above) grease "pan" and when fat has melted wipe off with
  absorbent paper.  This leaves a residue of fat, the cakes actually cook in
  their own fat.  The "pan" is hot enough when you can hold your hand just
  above it for about a minute.
  
  Place some cakes on "pan" and wait till they turn a speckled golden brown
  colour.  Turn them over and repeat on the other side.  They are better
  cooked quite slowly about 3-5 minutes each cake.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional Welsh biscuity cakes -- This is a very old traditional Welsh
  recipe from my boyfriend's family.  It was passed on to his mother from his
  grandmother, whose family ran the village bakery in Ammanford, near
  Swansea, Wales. The family name is Morgan, of course. They claim to be
  related to Captain Morgan, the pirate.
  
  The Welsh for welsh cakes is teisen lap (tea 'ion lap) which means "plate
  cake."  It is traditionally cooked on a "maern" (pronounced marn), which is
  a about half-inch thick piece of cast iron placed on the fire or cooker. A
  heavy frying pan or griddle will do.  Yield:  Makes 40-50.
  
  *  Mixed spice is a mix of ground spices that is available premixed here in
  England.  It is typically 60 percent coriander, 30 percent cinnamon, 5
  percent nutmeg, with small traces of ginger and clove. Sometimes it has
  10-15 percent caraway or 10 percent cassia (Saigon cinnamon) mixed in.
  Since almost all "cinnamon" sold in North America is really cassia, and
  cassia has a stronger flavor than true cinnamon, a North American formula
  for mixed spice would be 70 percent coriander, 15 percent cinnamon, 5
  percent nutmeg, and 10 percent caraway.
  
  *  Welsh cakes are great eaten hot or cold, with or without butter, though
  I never use butter myself. I usually make a double batch because they don't
  keep.  But to store them, allow to go cold and place in an airtight box.
  They will keep for up to a week.
  
  *  I often add a little more of the spices to give them more of a kick.

      Title: WATERCRESS SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Herbs, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Watercress bunch                    3 C  Water
    1/2 md Onion, coarsely                     1 T  Heavy cream
           -chopped                                 -(or whipping cream)
      1 md Potato, roughly                     1 oz Black caviar (lump
           -diced                                   -fish roe is fine)
    1/2    Garlic clove, chopped               4    Water biscuits
    1/2 oz Butter (or your                          -(bite-size)
           -favourite oil                      1 pn Salt and pepper
           -or margarine)                           -(to taste)
 
  Gently fry onion and garlic in a small amount of butter until transparent.
  Season lightly with salt and pepper, and add water and potato and boil
  until soft.
  
  Pick over watercress and chop 4 or five sprigs and set them aside.  Put
  onion and potato mixture in blender and puree. Add most of watercress,
  blend, re-season to taste and return to heat.
  
  Bring mixture to boil and simmer for 2 or three minutes.  Stir gently to
  prevent soup from sticking to bottom.  Remove from heat.
  
  This is the decision point.  Either set aside to cool, then chill, or carry
  on to serve the soup hot.
  
  Stir in cream and chopped watercress.  Heap a teaspoon of caviar on each of
  the water biscuits and float one on each bowl of soup immediately prior to
  serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Watercress soup, hot or cold -- This thick, creamy soup is equally good
  whether served hot or cold.  I have had watercress soup in restaurants, and
  my mother sometimes makes it, too, but this recipe is my own interpretation
  of the idea. Yield: Serves 4.
  
  *  Use the minimum amount of butter, oil, or margarine that will turn the
  onion transparent.  Those who are particularly diet-conscious could
  dispense with this step, and with the cream. Don't overdo the garlic, 1/2 a
  small clove is ample since it is a background flavour, not one that you
  should be aware of.
  
  *  A caution regarding seasoning.  Potatoes absorb a lot of salt so you may
  find it under-salted.  The caviar on the other hand, is very salty.  This,
  for me, is a delightful and important contrast. Guests can always add extra
  salt if they choose.
  
  *  Water biscuits are made by Carr's, amongst others, and can be found in
  most supermarkets, possibly in the gourmet food section. They are variously
  known as water biscuits, water crackers and table water crackers. To my
  mind the best for eating with cheese are the high-bake ones, but the
  regular type are better for this recipe. If you can't find them, then any
  round dry bland low-salt cracker will do.
  
  *  A 2 oz jar of lumpfish caviar costs a little under $3.00, but it does
  keep in the fridge so you can get two batches of four servings from one
  jar.  I suppose if budget is a prime consideration one could dispense with
  the caviar, too, but that would be like serving a martini without the
  olives. (Treasonable.)
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes of preparation, 1/2 hour of simmering.

      Title: MINDERBINDER
 Categories: Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
     50    Cotton balls, plain                 2 lb Bittersweet chocolate
           OR                                1/2 C  Liqueur, any favorite
           Cotton wool, 3 by 6 feet                 -[optional]
 
  If starting from cotton wool, divide it into about 50 pieces, making sure
  they are well formed, round, and the rough edges have been worked back into
  the mass to make a smooth surface.
  
  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler being careful not to get any water in
  the chocolate.
  
  In batches of about ten put the balls of cotton on a fine rack or grate.
  Sprinkle with the liqueur if you're using it.  [Be careful!  Too much will
  overpower the other flavors.]
  
  Slowly pour enough chocolate over each ball of cotton to coat it
  thoroughly, letting excess drip off. Allow the chocolate coating to cool
  before taking the chocolate covered cotton from the rack.
  
  Keep stored in a closed container in a cool place away from light.
  Munitions boxes work well for this.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate covered cotton -- This is a recipe I invented after I had
  cornered the cotton market and couldn't get rid of the stuff.
  
  While good orlon can be substituted for the cotton, the resulting product
  won't have the same flavor or texture as the real thing.  Your friends will
  be able to tell that you've been skimping. Egyptian cotton works best.
  Yield: About fifty servings.
  
  *  As a special cold-weather treat, use wool instead of cotton.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  2 hours.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: POTATO AND SPINACH SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 C  Onion (fresh),                      2 C  Spinach (chopped),
           -chopped                                 -cooked (fresh or frozen)
      2 T  Butter                             13 oz Evaporated milk
      2 C  Water                                    -(one standard can)
      1 t  Salt                              1/2 lb Cheese, grated
      2 C  Potatoes                                 -(Cheddar and Swiss
           -(about 2 pounds                         -work best, but any
           -of raw potatoes)                        -kind will do)
      1 t  Worcestershire sauce             
 
  In a 3-quart saucepan, saute the onion in the butter until the onion is
  translucent (about 3 minutes).
  
  Add water, potatoes, spinach and salt.  Cook until potatoes are tender
  (about 20 minutes). Longer cooking does not hurt, but turn down the heat to
  a simmer. Add milk and Worcestershire sauce. Reheat to near boiling, but do
  not boil.  Stir in grated cheese.  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *   A rich cream-style potato and spinach soup for a cold, winter day --
  This recipe is adapted from one that the U.S. Department of Agriculture
  used to distribute to potato growers in the 1930s. It is rich and thick,
  almost a meal in itself, and is very easy to make.

      Title: SAUSAGE SPAGHETTI SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1 lb Italian sausage                     1 sm Eggplant
      2 md Onions                              1 md Tomato
    1/2 lb Mushrooms                           8 oz Tomato sauce
      1 sm Green pepper                             -(1 standard can)
           -(or use frozen                          Salt, pepper, oregano
           -diced pepper)                           -to taste
 
  Slice the sausage into bite-size morsels and saute until browned.  Remove
  from pan, leaving fat for next step. (While the sausages are browning, you
  can cut up the vegetables.)
  
  Slice the onions and the mushrooms.  Cut the peppers into 1/2-inch squares
  and dice the tomato. Cut the eggplant into a julienne style.
  
  Add a little oil to the pan and saute the onions, peppers, mushrooms,
  eggplant and tomato until the onions are transparent and soft. Add the
  tomato sauce and the spices and return the sausage to the pan. Cook about
  15 minutes. Serve with fettucine.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spaghetti sauce with sausage, mushrooms and eggplant -- I made up this
  recipe the other day to use up some eggplant.  It was an instant hit.
  Yield: serves 13.
  
  *  Zucchini can be substituted for the eggplant, and canned tomatoes can be
  substituted for the tomato and sauce.  The sauce should be  relatively
  thick. The sausage can be hot or mild Italian sausage, but if you use mild
  sausage you will need to add more spices.

      Title: SOURDOUGH STARTER
 Categories: Breads, Sourdough, Usenet
      Yield: 3 cups
 
      2 C  Water, warm                         1 pk Yeast (dry), active
           -(about 110 degrees F.)                  -(optional)
  2 1/2 C  Flour                          
 
  Get a container for the starter.  Crockery is best, but just about anything
  can be used, except metal.  Try to get something with a lid.  I use a vinyl
  plastic food-storage container.
  
  Mix flour and water (and optionally yeast).  Let the starter sit (uncovered
  or loosely covered) in a warm place until bubbly and sour, about 3-5 days.
  
  If you do a lot of bread baking, there will probably be enough yeast spores
  floating around your kitchen so that the added yeast isn't needed.  The
  less yeast you add to the starter, the more "authentic" the flavor.
  
  If the starter starts turning orange or green, throw it away.  Other nasty
  things have started growing in it!
  
  After the starter is ready, it can be used immediately.  Try to use some of
  the starter once every few days, or it will start to die.  The starter can
  be refrigerated to last longer (use at least every other week). Make sure
  the starter is at room temperature before using.
  
  After using some of the starter, replenish what you take with equal amounts
  of warm water and flour. Let the starter sit until nice and bubbly before
  using again.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Starter culture for making sourdough bread -- Many people think of
  sourdough as something from the Gold Rush days.  Not so!  Sourdough was the
  first way raised breads were made.  "Way back then," there was no such
  thing as yeast (dry), active, and all breads (along with a number of other
  goodies) needed sourdough starter to rise.
  
  There are a number of recipes for sourdough starter, but this is one I've
  used, and it works fairly well.  It came originally from the cookbook "The
  Complete Sourdough Cookbook" by Don Holm.
  
  *  Usually, the first starter made will need a while to "come up to
  strength." Best bets for first recipes are ones that don't require much
  raising, such as pancakes, or ones that have additional yeast.

      Title: ESCARGOT AND CHANTERELLE PIZZA
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 1 pizza
 
      1 x  French bread dough                  2 oz Chanterelle mushrooms,
           -(Craig Claiborne's                      -dried
           -French bread recipe            1 1/2 lb Raclette cheese,
           -works well)                             -shredded
     10 oz French snails                       8 oz Tomato sauce
           -(the smaller the better;           2    Garlic cloves
           -burgundy snails taste              2 T  Parsley, fresh
           -best to me)                      1/2 lb Butter
 
  Make the French Bread dough recipe at least 1 day beforehand if you can.
  Roll the dough out into the shape of a pizza, put it on a pizza pan,and set
  it aside. It will keep in the refrigerator overnight.
  
  Prepare the dried mushrooms according to published recipes (soak, wash,
  cut, resoak, wash, drain).
  
  If the snails are too large (larger than a garlic clove), then cut them in
  pieces.  Drain the snails well.  Melt the butter in a baking dish, add the
  snails, crushed garlic, about 1/2 salt and ground black pepper to taste.
  
  Put the bread-dough pan on the top rack of the oven and the snails on the
  bottom rack of the oven, and cook them both for 10 minutes.  Take them out.
  
  Spread the tomato sauce in an even layer on the bread, then sprinkle the
  Raclette cheese over it.  Add the snails, and then the mushrooms.  Sprinkle
  with fresh parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  Bake at 425 degrees F. in the
  top rack for 12 minutes (bottom rack will burn the crust).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A pizza-like dish smothered in escargot and mushrooms -- I was recently
  at a potluck party where everyone was asked to bring an interpretation of
  "French pizza," what pizza would have tasted like if it had been invented
  in Rennes instead of in Naples. I concocted this dish for the occasion, and
  it was a success. If you aren't sure you like escargot, this is not the
  dish to experiment with! Yield: 1 large pizza.
  
  *  The first time I made this recipe I made it with morel mushrooms.  Their
  flavor overwhelmed even the garlic snails.  It was good, but it didn't have
  the balance I was looking for.  Chanterelles seem to fit better.  If you're
  unable to find or afford chanterelles, you can substitute Chinese straw
  mushrooms, which are available in cans wherever Chinese groceries are sold.
  European dried mushrooms seem always to have rocks and dirt in them; Asian
  dried mushrooms never do.  I guess the Asians wash them better before they
  dry them. It's impossible to get all of the rocks out.
  
  *  Raclette cheese is so much better than any other kind of cheese in this
  recipe that it is worth looking for.  If you absolutely cannot get it, use
  fondue cheese or a Gruyere.
  
  *  Raw butter also tastes more "authentic" in this recipe.  What you really
  want to use is Normandy butter, but it's hard to get in North America. Alta
  Dena raw butter is available in California; it makes a noticeable
  difference in the flavor of the escargot. I don't know of any other states
  in which it is legal to buy raw butter.

      Title: SCRAPPLE
 Categories: Breakfast, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      3 C  Chicken broth                     1/4 t  Thyme, ground fine
  1 1/3 C  Cornmeal (yellow)                 1/4 t  Cayenne
      1 T  Flour                               2 lb Chicken parts
  1 1/2 t  Salt                                1    Onion, chopped
    1/4 t  Sage, ground fine                   6    Peppercorns (cracked)
 
  Bring the chicken broth to a boil; add chopped onion and peppercorns.  Add
  chicken and cook until the meat falls off the bones (about 1 hour).
  
  Strain the cooked chicken out of the broth and save the broth.  Remove the
  bones and inedible parts from the cooked chicken, then chop or grind the
  cooked meat into fine pieces.  Be careful if you use a food processor, so
  that you don't puree the meat.
  
  Simmer the chicken broth in a large pan.  Mix cornmeal, flour, salt, thyme,
  sage and cayenne with about 1 cup of cold water.  Stir well.  Now slowly
  stir this mixture into the simmering broth.
  
  Add the cooked, ground chicken to the simmering pot.  Simmer and stir for
  about 5 minutes.  Pour hot mixture into well-greased loaf pans.  Chill
  until firm. To serve: remove from pan, cut into slices, roll in flour or
  cornmeal, and fry in a greased frying pan.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Eastern-style scrapple (a breakfast food like sausage) -- I grew up in
  Maryland, and in Maryland people eat scrapple for breakfast.  Among my
  schoolmates, the story was that if you ever found out what was in
  commercial scrapple you would stop eating it, and I did stop eating it for
  many years. But now I know how to make my own. I got this recipe from the
  University of Maryland poultry farming people, though I have added more
  seasonings because they seem to like blander foods than I do. Yield: serves
  6 hungry farmers.
  
  *  Vary the amount of salt in this recipe to suit your taste.  You can make
  scrapple out of almost any meat, though chicken and pork are traditional.
  For a different, and truly authentic Maryland taste, leave out the salt and
  cayenne and substitute about 2 t of Old Bay seasoning.
  
  *  A loaf of home-made scrapple will keep for 10 days in the refrigerator,
  or it can be cut into slices and frozen.

      1 t  Salt                              1/2 t  Cayenne
      1    Bay leaf                          1/2 t  Sage leaves
      2 t  Thyme leaves                             -(not powdered sage)
           -(not ground thyme)                 1 lb Pork liver
      5    Cloves, whole                       3    Garlic cloves
      2    Yellow onions                     1/4 lb Butter (1 stick)
 
  Peel and dice one onion.  Simmer pork ribs with salt, bay, thyme, cloves
  and onion in the water till the meat falls off the bones. Remove the bones
  and gristle, rub the meat into fibers (with your fingers), and reduce this
  pork liquor to about 4 cups by further boiling.
  
  Cool 1 cup of the pork liquor and mix it with coarse corn meal and cayenne.
  Add the sage, rubbing it between your fingers to crush it as you put it in.
  
  In your Cuisinart, using the steel blade, grind pork liver, the other
  onion, and the garlic cloves. Fry the resulting slurry in butter. Add the
  cornmeal mixture and the pork-liver mixture to the pork liquor and simmer
  the whole thing over a very low flame (or in the top of a double boiler)
  for half an hour. Spread thin into two 9-inch square pans to cool. (The
  pans needn't be greased.)
  
  To serve, cut and fry squares or fingers with sunny-side-up eggs on the
  side.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rough, livery, crusty scrapple.  Yield:  6 to 8 servings.

  Let cool for a bit.  Cut into squares and enjoy.  Mom insists on using
  "Borden Eagle Brand" sweetened condensed milk. Don't ask me why.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A nicely fattening combination of coconut and chocolate chips -- This
  comes from Mom. (She doesn't know where she got it; she memorized it years
  ago and lost the original recipe.) It's always been a favorite with us
  kids, and last time I was home she gave me the recipe. It's so simple that
  even a complete clutz like myself was able to make it perfectly the first
  time.
  
  : Difficulty:  trivial.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: SAUTEED SWEET POTATOES
 Categories: Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lg Sweet potatoes                    1/4 C  Lime juice
    1/4 lb Butter (1 stick)                    3 T  Sugar
    2/3 C  Tequila                        
 
  Grate the sweet potatoes into pieces about 1 inch long and about 1/4 inch
  thick.  Saute the sweet potatoes in the butter for 5 minutes.
  
  Add the tequila, lime juice and sugar, and cook covered, over moderate
  heat, for 5 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sweet potatoes sauteed in lime and tequila -- Rose's lime juice, a
  common brand, has a substantial amount of added sugar. Try to find lime
  juice without added sugar, or leave all the sugar out of the recipe if you
  can't find it. Naturally you will get the best results if you squeeze fresh
  limes to get the lime juice.
  
  : Difficulty:  trivial.
  : Time:  10 to 15 minutes, most of it spent grating the potatoes.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: RUM/BOURBON BALLS
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 2 dozen
 
      3 C  Vanilla Wafers                  1 1/2 t  Cocoa powder
           -(crushed)                          2 T  Corn syrup, white
      1 C  Sugar, powered                           -(honey also works well)
  1 1/2 C  Nuts, chopped                     1/2 C  Rum or Bourbon
 
  Mix all dry ingredients and set aside.
  
  Mix corn syrup or honey with rum or bourbon to thin the syrup.  Blend wet
  mixture into dry ingredients with fork.  Mix well.  Allow to sit for 1-2
  hours.
  
  At this point, if you let it sit a couple of hours, you can come  back and
  add another about 1/2 cup of rum or bourbon and let sit again. This process
  may be repeated a few times to your taste. The last time, the mix should
  sit a couple of hours so it's not really moist. There's a good midpoint
  between too moist and too dry where rolling into balls won't be difficult
  (too wet) or cause crumbling (too dry).
  
  Roll into balls, then roll in powered sugar to make a sugar coating.  When
  rolling in powered sugar, the moister they are, the more sugar will be
  absorbed over time.  They may need another roll in the sugar right before
  serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Intoxicating chocolate snack with rum or bourbon -- I got this from my
  mom who uses more alcohol than the original recipe called for but less than
  I like to use. It makes a great party snack. Yield: Makes about 30 small
  balls.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  1/2 to 1 hour preparation; 3 or more hours waiting.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: GUMBO-STYLE RICE
 Categories: Grains, Usenet
      Yield: 6 cups
 
      2 C  White rice, preferably          1 1/2 t  Green bell pepper,
           -converted                               -very finely chopped
  2 1/2 C  Chicken stock, homemade         1 1/2 t  Butter (unsalted),
           -or canned                               -melted
  1 1/2 t  Onions, very finely               1/2 t  Salt
           -chopped                            1 pn White pepper
  1 1/2 t  Celery, very finely                 1 pn Cayenne
           -chopped                            1 pn Black pepper
    1/8 t  Garlic powder             
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine all the ingredients in a 5x9
  inch loaf pan. Seal the pan snugly with aluminum foil. Bake until the rice
  is tender, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A basic steamed rice for gumbo dishes -- If you are making the gumbo for
  appetizer servings, make a 1/3 recipe.  If you make this ahead, leave out
  the bell peppers, since they sour quickly.
  
  *  You can use the rice right away, or leave it in the oven to stay warm
  for a couple of hours. If you save it longer than that, reheat in the top
  of a double boiler or stir it in a skillet with a little butter.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 70 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: POPPYSEED BUNDT CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 C  Butter (or margarine)               2 oz Poppy seeds
  1 1/2 C  Sugar                                    -(about 1/4 cup)
  2 1/2 C  Flour (sift                         1 t  Almond extract
           -before measuring)                       -(or vanilla extract)
      1 t  Baking soda                         4    Eggs (separated)
      2 t  Baking powder                     1/4 C  Brown sugar
      1 C  Buttermilk                          1 t  Cinnamon
 
  Soak poppyseed in the buttermilk for 15 minutes.
  
  Cream together butter and sugar.  Add yolks to creamed mixture.  Add almond
  extract or vanilla.  Add dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk
  mixture, a little at a time.
  
  Beat egg whites very stiff as for angel food.  Fold egg whites into
  mixture. Pour half of this batter mixture into well-greased Bundt pan.
  Sprinkle with a mixture of about 1/4 cup brown sugar and about 1 t
  cinnamon.  Pour in remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour.
  Cool and invert onto serving dish, then remove Bundt pan.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A light, delicate cake -- I got this recipe from my mom.  I'm not sure
  where she got it.
  
  *  When folding in egg whites, be gentle.  Lift and turn the batter instead
  of using a stirring motion. Don't worry if a little bit of egg white
  remains unmixed; the egg whites will collapse if you mix it too much.
  
  *  I have tried both vanilla and almond extracts with this recipe, and
  prefer the former.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate (folding the beaten egg whites into the
  batter takes some skill).
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.
  : Precision:  Measure carefully.

      3 T  Sugar                                    -(grated)
  1 3/4 t  Pumpkin pie spice                 1/4 t  Salt
           -mixture (divided)                 16 oz Pumpkin, cooked
      6 T  Butter (melted)                          -(not pumpkin pie filling)
      1 lb Cottage cheese,                    16 oz Sour cream
           -creamed (small curd)             1/4 C  Orange marmalade
      4 lg Eggs                                     -(or more to taste,
  1 1/2 lb Cream cheese,                            -up to about 1 cup)
           -softened by warming                     Orange slices for
      1 C  Sugar                                    -garnish (optional)
 
  Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  Mix graham cracker crumbs, walnuts, sugar,
  about 1/4 t of the pumpkin pie spice, and the butter.  Press evenly into
  the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan. Bake 10 minutes, then cool. (Leave
  the oven on).
  
  Mix cottage cheese and eggs in a blender until smooth.  Beat the cream
  cheese, sugar, flour, orange rind, about 1 1/2 t pumpkin pie spice, salt
  and cottage cheese mixture in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Fold in the
  pumpkin. Pour over the graham cracker crust. Bake at 300 degrees F. for 1
  1/2 hours. Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake in the oven with the
  door ajar for 1 hour.
  
  Remove cake from oven.  Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix the sour cream
  and the marmalade.  Spread over the top of the cheesecake.  Bake 10
  minutes. Cool slightly, garnish with orange slices if you like, then
  refrigerate.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A cheesecake rich with pumpkin flavor.  Yield:  1 10-inch cake.
  
  *  A North American pumpkin is not the same vegetable as a European or
  Asian pumpkin, but it will probably taste nice anyhow.

      Yield: 1 cake
 
-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
      1 C  Flour                               1    Egg yolk
    1/4 C  Sugar                             1/4 C  Butter, softened
      1 t  Vanilla                       

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
  2 1/2 lb Cream cheese,                     3/4 t  Ginger, ground
           -softened                         1/2 t  Cinnamon, ground
    3/4 C  Light brown sugar,                  1 lb Pumpkin, canned
           -packed                             2    Egg yolks
      1 C  Sugar                               5    Eggs
      3 T  Flour                               1 t  Vanilla extract
    3/4 t  Allspice, ground                  1/4 C  Cream, heavy
 
  MAKE PASTRY:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Grease the bottom and
  sides of a 9-inch-diameter, 3-inch deep springform pan.
  
  Prepare the pastry by stirring flour and sugar together in a bowl.  Cut in
  butter, egg yolk and extract.  Work the dough (which will be very crumbly)
  with hands to complete the mixing.  Evenly press the dough on the bottom
  and up the sides (to within about 1/2 inch of the top) of the springform
  pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
  Remove and set aside to cool while preparing the filling.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Increase the oven temperature to 475 degrees F.  Beat the
  cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth and soft. Beat in the sugars,
  flour, spices and pumpkin until well blended. Add egg yolks and eggs one at
  a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract, beat in
  well. Stir in the cream.
  
  Pour filling into the pastry crust.  Bake for 12 minutes.  Without opening
  the oven door, reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F. and leave the
  cheesecake in the oven for an additional 1 hour and 15 minutes.  At the end
  of the baking time, turn off the oven, but leave the cheesecake sitting
  inside (without opening the door) until the oven cools (about 2 to 3
  hours). Remove from the oven, refrigerate overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A holiday alternative to pumpkin pie -- This cheesecake has to be tried
  to be believed. It was developed by Karen Reynolds, a charming lady, fine
  programmer and amazing cook.

      Title: PUMPKIN PIE
 Categories: Pies, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 1 pie
 
      2 T  Butter, melted                      1 t  Ginger
  1 3/4 C  Pumpkin (one                        1 t  Cinnamon
           -standard can)                    1/4 t  Mace
      2    Eggs                              1/4 t  Cloves, ground
      2 T  Flour                             1/2 t  Salt
      1 C  Evaporated milk                     1    Pie shell (standard),
    1/2 C  Sugar, dark brown                        -uncooked
    1/2 C  White sugar                    
 
  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.  Beat the eggs until frothy.  Mix in the
  sugars and the flour.  Mix in the spices and the salt.  Mix in the pumpkin.
  Mix in the melted butter.  Finally, mix in the milk.
  
  Pour the mix into the pie crust and bake at 450 degrees F. for 15 minutes.
  Decrease heat to 375 degrees F. and bake for an additional 45 minutes.
  Remove the pie from the oven and set it out to cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Pumpkin Pie with flour -- This is my mother's recipe for her
  traditional Thanksgiving dinner pumpkin pie. It is different from most
  other pumpkin pie recipes in that flour and brown sugar are used in the
  batter.  Even my wife, who is not a big pumpkin pie fan, thought this was a
  yummy pie.
  
  When my parents first got married, every pumpkin pie my mom made for my dad
  was rejected with the comment "it's not like mother used to make."  She
  even tried to use his mother's recipe, but she could not follow it: his
  mother used ordinary kitchen utensils for measuring devices (like a teacup
  for a "cup," a real table spoon for a "tablespoon," etc.). She finally
  found a recipe that looked similar to grandma's. Through the years she has
  altered it slightly to make the pie even more tastier.
  
  *  Don't be surprised if the pie rises slightly.  It will go down again
  after it cools.
  
  *  Make sure you get just pumpkin.  Don't use a can of "pumpkin pie mix"
  instead!  If you were very ambitious, you could gut a pumpkin yourself for
  this recipe, but I have never had the time or courage to do that.
  
  *  You can buy a pie shell crust or you can make your own.  Certainly, the
  results are better when you make your own.
  
  *  Light brown sugar can be used instead of dark, but the result isn't as
  good.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, plus desired cooling time.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients, especially the spices.

      Title: JORDAN POND HOUSE POPOVERS
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 2 popovers
 
      2 lg Eggs                                1 C  Flour, all-purpose
      1 C  Whole milk                               -(Important! Sift
    1/2 t  Salt                                     -before measuring!!)
    1/8 t  Baking soda                    
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Beat the eggs at high speed with an
  electric mixer for 3 minutes, or until the mixture turns lemon yellow. Slow
  the mixer to a crawl and dribble in about 1/2 cup of milk, taking about 20
  seconds to pour it in.
  
  Into another bowl, sift the flour and measure 1 cup as exactly as you can,
  sift 100 g flour then add salt and baking soda and sift again.  With the
  mixer still running on its slowest speed, add the dry ingredients to the
  eggs and milk. Turn the mixer off and use a rubber spatula to make sure
  that all of the flour has blended in with the liquid.
  
  Set the mixer to medium speed and dribble in the remaining milk.  Blend for
  1 minute. Turn the mixer to its highest speed and beat for 10 minutes (or 5
  minutes if you have a Kitchen-aid style mixer that uses a wire whip for
  beating).  Extra beating can't hurt.
  
  Filter the batter through a fine-mesh screen strainer to remove any lumps,
  then pour into well-buttered popover cups or custard cups.  (If you must
  use a muffin tin, fill only the 4 corners.) Bake at 425 degrees F. for 15
  minutes. Without opening the oven, turn heat to 350 degrees F. and bake for
  15 more minutes (20 minutes if your oven door has a window).
  
  Serve immediately, with fresh jam and room-temperature butter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Popovers from the Jordan Pond teahouse -- In Acadia National Park, near
  Bar Harbor Maine, is Jordan Pond. A century ago the teahouse at Jordan Pond
  was a gathering place where the aristocracy had tea and popovers with
  strawberry jam each day at 4 o'clock.
  
  The Jordan Pond Tea House burned down in 1978, but has been rebuilt.  It
  now serves people sporting clothes announcing "Mommy and Daddy went to
  Naugatuck, and all they brought me was this crummy shirt," and who show up
  in station wagons, but the popovers are the same that were served to the
  idle rich of another era. Yield: 2 large popovers.
  
  *  These popovers turn out significantly better if they are baked in
  crockery custard cups rather than in metal or glass.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking.

      1 C  Chicken stock                      10    Peppercorns
      1    Bay leaf                                 -(bruised)
      2    Cloves, whole                     1/4 C  Mandarine Napoleon

           -and chopped)                  
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Rub pheasant inside and out with salt and
  pepper.  Sprinkle with port.  Stuff with bay leaf, cloves, garlic, parsley,
  celery leaves, lemon, juniper berries and tangerine.
  
  Sew the body cavity of the pheasant shut.  Moisten the larding pork or
  bacon with port and cover the breast. To the roasting pan add onion slices,
  mushroom peelings, about 1 cup of port, chicken stock, salt to taste,
  peppercorns, more juniper berries to taste, and Mandarine liqueur.  Roast
  40-45 minutes, basting every 10 minutes at least.
  
  Strain gravy.  Let stand and skim fat.  Just before serving, add sour
  cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  HOMME Pheasant for Thanksgiving -- A couple of years ago, we decided
  that pheasant would be the perfect Thanksgiving meal for two. My husband
  conflated the best parts of all the pheasant recipes we could find (most
  came from the Gourmet cookbook) and came up with a recipe that I find
  wonderful.  It's moist and tender; tastes like chicken gone to heaven. (One
  of pheasant's main problems, by the way, is that it tends to be dry.)
  
  *  (We usually stick the whole cloves into the tangerine, insert all the
  other spices into the body cavity, then add the tangerine.)
  
  *  Some of these ingredients may be hard to find; feel free to omit them.
  "Mushroom peelings" are simply mushroom stems and leftovers, chopped fine.
  "Bruised peppercorns" are peppercorns that have been hit with a wooden
  mallet. Bon appetit, and good luck!
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.

      Title: PEACHY BBQ RIBS
 Categories: Meats, Barbecue, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 lb Pork spareribs, cut               1/4 C  Onions (chopped fine)
           -into serving-size pieces           2 T  Flour (gravy flour
      2 t  Salt                                     -works best)
      1 lb Peaches (use one                    2 T  Mustard, prepared
           -can of cling peaches)            1/2 t  Cloves (ground finely)
      1 C  Ketchup                           1/2 t  Pepper (fresh-ground
      2 T  Worcestershire sauce                     -black pepper is best)
 
  Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.  In shallow roasting pan, arrange ribs,
  meaty side up; sprinkle with about 1 t salt. Drain peaches, save syrup.
  
  In saucepan, blend about 1 cup of saved peach-packing syrup with ketchup,
  worcestershire sauce, onion, flour, cloves, about 1 t salt and pepper. Heat
  to boiling; pour over ribs.  Bake about 1 1/2 hours, or until fork tender,
  turning once.  Arrange peaches around ribs; bake about 5 minutes, basting
  with the sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pork ribs in peach tomato barbecue sauce -- Moons ago my Mom made this
  for all us kids. Wouldn't eat it (ribs & peaches? YUCHH!). Years
  (literally) passed. Well, if you hadn't guessed, when I tried it, I decided
  to post it to the net (as soon as I grew up). Yield: Serves 4 to 6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 1/2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: ARTICHOKE OYSTER SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 T  Butter, melted                      4 C  Oysters, drained; reserve
    1/2 C  Shallots (chopped fine)                  -liquid (less, to taste)
    1/4 t  Thyme                              14 oz Artichoke hearts, cooked
      1    Bay leaf                            2 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Cayenne pepper                    1/4 t  Tabasco
      2 T  Flour                             1/2 C  Whipping cream
     14 oz Chicken broth                       3 T  Parsley (chopped, fresh)
           -(more or less won't hurt)     
 
  In a 3-quart casserole, melt butter and saute shallots.  When shallots are
  translucent, add thyme, bay leaf and cayenne pepper.  Add flour and whisk
  well.  Add broth, oyster water, artichoke hearts, salt and tabasco.  Bring
  to a boil. Add oysters and parsley. Simmer on medium, partly covered, for
  exactly 5 minutes.  Add whipped cream and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken broth with artichokes and poached oysters -- This is a modern
  cajun-style recipe that I adapted from a local convenience-food cookbook by
  Jean Durkee.  It's an intriguing combination of modern American ingredients
  with traditional cajun flavorings.
  
  *  Fresh parsley tastes much better than dried parsley.  If the oysters are
  bigger than a small bite-size, cut them up before adding them to the soup.
  Use the smallest oysters you can find.
  
  *  When I'm not making a double recipe, I usually dump the entire (about
  1-cup) container of whipping cream into the soup, even though that's double
  what the recipe calls form.
  
  *  The timing on cooking the oysters is fairly critical.  If you overcook
  them, they will be rubbery.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

      Title: CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
 Categories: Mousse, Usenet
      Yield: 12 servings
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
    1/2 C  Butter                              1 t  Vanilla
      1 C  Flour                               1 t  Lemon peel, grated
      1    Egg yolk (see note)                      -(optional)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
     13 oz Chocolate, semisweet                4    Eggs, separated
           -(see note)                        16 oz Whipping cream
      3 oz Unsweetened chocolate                    Powdered sugar
      2    Eggs, whole                              -(confectioner's)
 
  Make the crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cut flour and butter
  together.  With a fork mix in egg yolk, vanilla and lemon peel.  Press onto
  the bottom and sides of a 9 inch springform pan, and bake for 10-12 minutes
  at 350 degrees F., or until it just begins to turn slightly golden.
  
  Melt all the chocolate in a double boiler.    Whip the whipping cream with
  about 2-3 T of powdered sugar (the stiffer you whip it, the stiffer the
  mousse will be).
  
  Beat the eggs whites with about 2-3 T powdered sugar.
  
  Remove the top pan of the double boiler (with the  melted chocolate) from
  the bottom pan and let it cool a bit. ("Cool" means it's only cool enough
  so that when you add the eggs in the next step, they don't cook. You still
  need to be able to stir it.)
  
  Add the whole eggs to the chocolate, one at a time, and mix well.  Then add
  the egg yolks one at a time and mix well.
  
  Mix some of the whipping cream (enough to lighten the chocolate) into the
  chocolate.  Alternately fold in the whipping cream and the egg whites into
  the chocolate. Pour into the crust. Refrigerate 6 hours or overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich but not cloying chocolate mousse -- This recipe is based on one
  that appeared several years ago in _Bon Appetit_. After much
  experimentation, we have come up with this recipe, which is less sweet than
  the original and downright scrumptious. (I even like it, and I don't
  generally like chocolate anything.) Yield: Serves 12-20.
  
  *  This is my cheesecake crust.  A graham cracker crust works well too. The
  original recipe used a crust made from chocolate wafer cookies.
  
  *  If you have no better use for the extra egg white in making the crust,
  add it to the egg whites used in the filling.
  
  *  I don't recommend Ghirardelli chocolate, as it's too sweet.
  
  *  The function of the powdered sugar is to help the cream/whites stiffen.
  The sweetness of the mousse comes from the semisweet chocolate, not the
  powdered sugar.  You can also use a 12-inch springform.  Instead of putting
  the crust up the entire sides, just go up half way.  Or you can use two
  8-inch springforms. In this case either spread the crust very thin or
  increase the crust by 50 percent.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  About 45-60 minutes for beginners, 30 minutes once you have it
  down. Cooking time: 15 minutes for the crust.
  : Precision:  crust ingredients should be measured precisely.

      Title: EASY MARGARITAS
 Categories: Drinks, Usenet
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      6 oz Limeade, frozen                     6 oz Water
      6 oz Vodka                                    Ice
 
  Blend equal parts of limeade, vodka and water in a blender.  Add ice and
  blend to slushiness desired. More ice makes it slushier.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Vodka margaritas.  Yield:  Serves 3-4.
  
  *  Officially, a margarita calls for tequila instead of the vodka, with a
  splash of triple sec.  No one notices the absence of the triple sec  and
  many people prefer the taste of vodka.
  
  : Difficulty:  trivial.
  : Time:  2 minutes.
  : Precision:  use equal measures of the ingredients.

      Title: MANDARIN SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Straw mushrooms, dried              1 T  Dark soy sauce
    1/4 lb Pork, lean                          2 T  Cornstarch, mixed with
    1/2 C  Bamboo shoots                     1/4 C  Water
           Bean curd, fresh                    1    Egg
           -(2 pieces)                         1    Scallion, chopped
      4 C  Chicken stock                       1 T  Sesame oil
      1 t  Salt                           
 
  Soak mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes.  Drain, reserving liquid.  Cut
  pork, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, bean curd into thin strips.
  
  Combine stock and reserved mushroom liquid in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil.
  Add salt, soy sauce, pork, bamboo shoots, mushrooms.  Cover and simmer 5
  minutes.  Add bean curd and again bring to a boil.  Add small amount of hot
  liquid to cornstarch paste, stirring.  Add mixture to pan and cook for 1 or
  2 more minutes.
  
  Beat egg lightly and slowly add it to hot soup.  Stir once, gently.  Remove
  soup from heat.  Sprinkle with chopped scallion and sesame oil.  Serve
  immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Bamboo shoot, pork and mushroom soup -- I worked out this recipe in an
  attempt to duplicate the Mandarin Soup served at the Peking Royal Kitchen
  in Pittsburgh. My friends all agree that it is a good replica; some prefer
  my version to the "real thing." Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  The quality of the chicken stock makes a huge difference in a recipe
  like this. Use fresh stock if you can, or buy the best grade of canned
  chicken stock you can find.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes waiting and 20 minutes preparing.
  : Precision:  Measure spices and seasonings.

      Title: LAMB CACCIATORE
 Categories: Meats, Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 lb Lamb shoulder or leg;             1/2 t  Sage leaves, dried
           -trim fat and cut                   2 t  Flour
           -into bite-size cubes             1/2 C  Vinegar (white or wine)
    1/3 C  Olive oil                         1/2 C  Water
      1 sm Garlic clove, minced                     Salt and pepper,
      1 t  Rosemary, dried, crushed                 -to taste
 
  In a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish brown the meat in hot olive oil.
   Be careful not to burn the olive oil: it has a lower burning temperature
  than other kinds of cooking oil.
  
  Add garlic, rosemary and sage.  Stir.  Sprinkle flour on meat and stir.
  Continue cooking the meat while stirring, to brown the flour a bit.  Add
  vinegar and water.  Stir thoroughly.  Cover, lower heat, and simmer 1 hour
  or until meat is tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  Stir frequently during cooking, and add a little hot water if necessary to
  prevent burning.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An Easy Lamb Stew -- I got this recipe from my mom.  I'm not sure where
  she got it. It's not a typical cacciatore (i.e. smothered in tomato sauce);
  instead, it's tart and tastes of herbs.  It smells great when it's cooking.
  It's very easy to make.  Yield:  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20-30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: JACK JUBILEE
 Categories: Casseroles, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 md Onion, finely chopped               1 C  Half-and-half
      2 T  Butter                                   -(or light cream)
      8 oz Tomato sauce                       11 oz Corn chips (one package)
           -(1 large can)                    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese
      4 oz Green chili peppers,                     -(cut into 1/2 inch cubes)
           -chopped (1 can)                  1/2 C  Cheddar cheese (shredded)
    1/2 t  Salt                                     Paprika
      2    Eggs, slightly beaten               1 C  Sour cream
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Saute onion in butter until transparent.
  Stir in tomato sauce, chopped peppers and salt. Simmer 5 minutes. Remove
  from heat. Combine eggs and cream. Stir into sauce.
  
  Place half the corn chips in bottom of a 1 1/2 quart casserole.  Add in
  layers, half the Monterey Jack cheese, half the sauce.  Repeat.  Top with
  sour cream. Sprinkle with shredded cheddar cheese and paprika. Bake,
  uncovered, for 30 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A casserole made with jack cheese -- I got this recipe from the National
  Dairy Council.  It's good winter food; easy to make and rich.
  
  Don't let the corn chips put you off; normally, such an ingredient would
  make me think it's one of those recipes for people who don't like to cook
  and don't care about good food. Take my word for it: this recipe is an
  exception.
  
  *  Ingredient notes for non-US cooks:  Monterey Jack cheese is a bland
  American cheddar from Monterey, California.  Try substituting Dunlop
  (Scottish), Lancashire (English), or Cantal (French).  Half and half is a
  dairy product that is 50 percent whole milk and 50 percent heavy cream;
  light cream makes a reasonable substitute. Corn chips, often sold as
  "Fritos" or "Doritos," are a packaged snack food made of deep-fried pressed
  cornmeal. I cannot think of any reasonable substitute for them in this
  recipe.  [Ed.]
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.

      3 oz Chocolate, bitter                 1/8 t  Salt
  2 1/2 C  Sugar, powdered                     1 t  Vanilla
 
  Melt butter with chocolate in saucepan.  Add other ingredients (except
  vanilla) and cook 20-25 minutes over medium heat.  Mixture will slowly
  thicken.  Add vanilla and serve over ice cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Hot fudge sauce for ice cream -- This is the fudgiest and best sauce
  you'll ever taste. The recipe has been passed down in our family for years
  and years.
  
  *  This sauce becomes like fudge candy when refrigerated, and it's hard to
  keep from poking your finger in it for a taste.  Simply reheat in a
  saucepan to melt it down.

      Title: BYRON'S FAMOUS KILLER CHEESE DIP
 Categories: Dips, Party, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
     11 oz Cheese soup (one can                2 T  Chili powder
           -of condensed soup)                 1 T  Cumin
      4 oz Green chilies, chopped              1    Garlic clove, crushed
           -(I use Old El Paso               1/4 t  Hot sauce (Tabasco sauce
           -canned chilies)                         -or hot pepper sauce)
      1 md Yellow onion, chopped               8 oz Sour cream
      1 T  Red pepper, crushed            
 
  Mix together all ingredients except the sour cream; heat to boiling at low
  heat.  When blended, correct seasoning (usually needs more cumin and
  garlic.) Add sour cream and heat until it bubbles slightly. Serve with
  Tostitos or any natural Mexican-style corn chip.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A hot spicy party cheese dip -- Here it is, folks!  By popular demand,
  the cheese dip known to make women faint, strong men cry, and small
  children run for their mommies. This started out as an attempt to replicate
  a Chili con Queso dip, but took off in its own direction. Yield: makes 18
  oz of dip.
  
  *  This recipe may be doubled, quadruped or even sextupled without problem.
  Go easy on the red pepper if your guests don't like hot food.  The effect,
  if done correctly, should be an initial impression of cheese, cumin, sour
  cream and garlic followed a second later by a sinus-cleaning heat. As one
  partaker has put it "You have to keep eating because if you don't, you'll
  die." Guaranteed to increase beer consumption at parties.
  
  Good Luck!
  
  : Difficulty:  very easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the spices, just so you'll know how much you have put
  in.

      1 lb Raisins, white                      2 C  Sugar
    1/4 t  Cloves, ground                 
 
  Cream together butter, sugar and eggs in one bowl.  In another bowl, mix
  the dry ingredients together (flour, salt, soda and seasonings). Add the
  flour mixture to the butter mixture half at a time, alternating it with the
  applesauce.  Pick all the black gumdrops out and eat them or throw them
  away. Add the nuts, raisins, coconut and remaining gumdrops; blend well.
  
  Line 2 large loaf pans or 5 small loaf pans with wax paper! (Grease won't
  work).  Fill pans about 2/3 full.  Bake at 300 degrees F. for about 2
  hours. Let cool for about 15 minutes before you try to remove the loaves
  from the pan. They should just fall right out when turned upside down, then
  peel off the wax paper.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cake with gumdrops, applesauce, raisins and coconut.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food
  processor is tedious.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 2 hours baking, 15 minutes cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
  
  The smaller gumdrops work best when you go to cut the cake.  I can never
  find small gumdrops that are not 'spice drops', so I buy the large ones and
  cut them into quarters. The cake also slices a lot better when almost
  entirely cool. If you try to cut a piece while it's still hot, it'll taste
  GREAT, but it will crumble all over.

      Title: SOFT GINGER BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1 C  Butter                              1 t  Ginger
      1 C  Sugar, white                        1 t  Cinnamon
      2 t  Baking soda                     2 3/4 C  White flour
           -(That's SODA, not POWDER)          2 lg Eggs
      1 C  Water (boiling)                   1/4 C  Sugar, powdered
      1 C  Blackstrap molasses               1/4 C  Diluted milk (half
      1 t  Salt                                     -milk and half water)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and sugar in a
  bowl big enough to hold the entire recipe.
  
  Dissolve the baking soda in about 1 cup boiling water.  Add that mixture
  and the molasses, salt, ginger, cinnamon and flour to the butter-sugar
  cream. Mix only until moistened and evenly distributed.
  
  Lightly beat the eggs, then add them to the bowl and beat the complete
  mixture well. Grease a 9 x 13 shallow baking pan (or a 10-inch round
  casserole dish). Pour the mixture into the dish. Bake for about 45 minutes,
  or until a poked toothpick comes out clean.
  
  Mix the powdered sugar and the diluted milk together to form an icing, and
  brush on to the gingerbread.
  
  Serve warm! You can make a refreshing variation on this basic recipe by
  replacing about 1 cup of the flour with whole-wheat flour, reducing the
  sugar to about 1/2 cup and increasing the molasses to about 1 1/4 cups.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional gingerbread, soft and chewy -- I got this recipe from a
  college roommate, who got it from her mother. Yield: makes 1 pan
  gingerbread.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes plus baking and cooling time.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: MO'S ANCESTRAL EGGNOG
 Categories: Drinks, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 16 cups
 
     12    Eggs, separated                     8 C  Whipping cream, heavy
      1 lb Confectioner's sugar                2 t  Nutmeg (or less)
      2 C  Liquor                            1/2 C  Sugar
 
  Separate the 12 eggs.  Set the whites aside in the 'fridge, tightly covered
  for safety, as they won't be needed until much later.  Beat the yolks until
  they noticeably lighten in color.  From here on out, an industrial-strength
  mixer (Kitchen-Aid K5, for instance) is a big help.
  
  Continue beating the yolks while adding the confectioner's sugar.  Beat for
  about 4 minutes or until the mixture turns much lighter yellow and takes on
  a satin-like texture. While still beating, slowly add about 2 cups liquor.
  [If you decide you need more, this is NOT where you put it in.]
  
  After the liquor is thoroughly beaten in, cover the mixture with  plastic
  wrap or aluminum foil and let it stand for 1 hour at room temperature. This
  is to cook the eggs and takes much longer if you refrigerate. [I lay
  plastic wrap right down on top of the mixture to avoid any possible skin
  that might form.]
  
  After standing, add the heavy whipping cream, unwhipped! You could try
  whipping it first, but again, you are on your own.  Add the nutmeg. OPTION:
  At this point, the original recipe calls for adding an additional 2-4 cups
  of liquor, but I omitted this as it passed a taste-test as-is. If you want
  your 'Nog a LOT stronger, have at it, but please taste before you pour.
  
  Mix thoroughly, again.  Refrigerate the mixture for 3 hours to let it
  ripen. I use two large juice containers. It splits nicely between them and
  will fit in our 'fridge. [Overnight is good, if you're making it for, say,
  Christmas day, but see the safety note below if you intend to let it sit
  overnight.]
  
  At the end of the 3 hours, remember where you put the egg whites.  Beat
  them until stiff but not dry, adding about 1/2 cup sugar to slightly
  sweeten the whites. N.B.: 12 egg whites whip into quite a mass, so be
  prepared.  [You can also whip them 6 at a time. This is probably a very
  good idea if you're doing it in a Kitchen Aid, since 12 might overflow the
  bowl.]
  
  Pour the whites into the serving bowl you will be using.  Then gently and
  slowly pour the other mixture into the bowl, mixing with a whisk to fold it
  all together.   The whites should be smoothly and evenly distributed
  through the 'Nog to make it fluffy. They will lose some of their bulk so
  don't be afraid to mix thoroughly. Sprinkle the top with some more nutmeg,
  and serve. A shaker of nutmeg by the bowl is a nice touch for those wanting
  a shake on their own mugful. [The first time I made this recipe, I had to
  keep re-stirring the mixture. The only difference I can think of is that
  the second time I didn't add sugar to the egg whites.]
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Wonderful Eggnog -- I got this recipe from net.cooks back in 1982.  It
  was posted by Mike O'Dell (known around the network as mo). I have made it
  for the last two Christmases, and find it quite good. The recipe is
  basically as he posted it. I have added a few comments in brackets.
  Apparently he served it at a party at LBL-CSAM that year.
  
  This wonderful formula was handed down to me from my grandmother, who got
  it from her mother and grandmother. I heartily recommend it as a superior
  lubricant for the festive season.  Yield:  Makes about 16 cups.
  
  *  [This makes a large amount of eggnog.  Last year I made a half recipe,
  which sufficed for the 10 or so people we had then.  This year I made the
  whole thing, and 16 people left some over (some of them don't drink,
  though).]
  
  Powered sugar will do nicely, and even granulated would probably work if
  you beat long enough.
  
  *  For the liquor, use bourbon, rum, vodka, Canadian blended, or whatever
  you like. Being a bourbon fan, I used that in the batch for the CSAM party.
  The others should work but I haven't tried them. Depending on taste, you
  may want more than this. [I used rum the times I made it.] Enjoy!!!
  
  Difficulty:  moderate;  Time:  1/2 hour preparation, 3 hours waiting;
  Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: HOPKINS NEOLITHIC EGG NOG
 Categories: Drinks, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
     12    Egg whites                          4 C  Heavy cream, beaten
    1/2 C  Sugar                               4 C  Milk
     12    Egg yolks                           4 C  Bourbon
      1 C  Sugar                               1 C  Dark rum
    1/4 t  Salt                                     -e.g., Myers's Rum
 
  Beat whites stiff; beat in about 1/2 cup sugar.
  
  Beat yolks until very light with about 1 cup sugar and the salt.  Combine
  and stir until thoroughly blended. Add cream, then milk, then Bourbon. Beat
  well.  Add rum.  Store in a cold cellar for a week.
  
  Serve with freshly-grated nutmeg.  The egg nog should be ladled from the
  bottom of the bowl, and never stirred, in order to maintain its layered
  quality.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional layered eggnog with bourbon and dark rum -- This is the egg
  nog that was served at the Hopkins Neolithic Xmas Party, a party that some
  friends used to have every year. We now serve it for our Winter Solstice
  celebration. It's purported to come from the original "Fanny Farmer
  Cookbook."  Yield: Serves 15-20, inebriates 6.
  
  *  An alternate method, preferred by some, is to make a creamy, non-layered
  egg nog by stirring gently every day.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5-10 minutes preparation; 1 week aging.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

  party drink.  This recipe makes a rich and powerful eggnog.  Yield:  Serves
  20.
  
  *  This stuff is POTENT, even if you reduce the rum by half.  Brandy, dark
  rum or bourbon may be substituted for the light rum. If you prefer a
  nonalcoholic eggnog, leave out the booze altogether. With or without booze,
  this eggnog is very rich and very good.

 Categories: Legumes, Caribbean, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Beans, dried                        2 t  Salt  (You can
      1    Onion, diced                             -vary the amount

      3    Garlic cloves, diced                     -preference.  My mother
      8 oz Tomato sauce                             -uses about 1 T )
      2 T  Olive oil                     

----------------------------RICE TO GO WITH IT:----------------------------
      1 t  Salt (You can                       2 C  Water
           -vary the amount of salt            1 C  Rice, long-grain
           -according to preference)      
 
  PREPARE BEANS:  Soak the beans for at least two hours (overnight is okay
  too). Change the water and bring to a boil. Add the onion, pepper and
  garlic; cover and simmer for 1 hour.
  
  Add the tomato sauce, olive oil and salt:  cover and simmer 1 more hour.
  (Be sure to keep the beans covered with liquid, adding more water if
  necessary.)
  
  PREPARE RICE:  Bring the water to a boil.  Add the rice and salt.  Cover
  and let simmer for 20 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Beans like they cook in many Caribbean countries -- This recipe is from
  my mother, who undoubtedly got it from one of my father's relatives. I've
  seen it described as being from various countries, but it will always be
  Puerto Rican beans to me.
  
  Any dried beans can be used, but kidney beans and navy beans are the best.
  Chick peas aren't bad either.  You can use a ham bone for flavoring instead
  of the olive oil if you don't mind using ham. Yield: Serves 4.
  
  *  This makes a very good main course or side dish.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  2 hours soaking, 5 minutes dicing, 2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  the rice is the only part you need to measure.

    1/4 t  Ginger, ground                           Seasoned flour
    1/4 t  Nutmeg, ground                           -(flour with salt and

    1/2 t  Mustard, dry                   
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine the cranberry sauce, sherry,
  chicken broth, spices and sugar. Simmer for 10 minutes, then discard the
  star anise.
  
  Heat the butter in a skillet until it is foamy.  Dredge the chicken breasts
  in the seasoned flour, and saute in the butter for 1 minute on each side.
  Transfer the chicken to an ovenproof dish.
  
  Pour the cranberry mixture into the skillet, and reduce by half over high
  heat.  Pour the sauce over the chicken, and bake at 350 degrees F. for 15
  minutes.

      Title: IRISH'S CRAB BUTTER
 Categories: Dips, Party, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
    1/2 C  Butter                                   Cocktail sauce
      1 C  Cream cheese                        2 T  Lemon juice
    1/4 C  Mayonnaise                        1/2 t  Garlic, crushed (or a
      6 oz Crab meat                                -pinch of instant garlic)
      1 lg Onion, chopped fine                 1 T  Worcestershire sauce
 
  Allow butter and cream cheese to soften before starting.  Mix mayo, butter
  and cream cheese. Do not use a blender, as the mixture will get soupy. Add
  lemon juice, garlic, worcestershire sauce, pepper, etc. to taste.
  
  Mix in crab (or whatever) and onion.  Of the choices, I feel crab is the
  best. Chill at least two hours, cover with cocktail sauce. This is an
  important part of the recipe.
  
  I recommend Wakefield crab meat, Shrimp or Shrimp & Crab.  I usually use
  Crosse & Blackwell's cocktail sauce, but feel free to use any kind that you
  trust.  You can make your own simple cocktail sauce by mixing 3 parts
  catsup to 1 part horseradish and adding tabasco, garlic, worcestershire
  sauce to taste.
  
  Serve over Triscuits (they're nice and strong, to survive heavy scooping)
  or veggies. Irish is the friend from whom I got this recipe.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Incredible crab or shrimp dip -- My first encounter with this dip came
  at a New Year's party a few years ago. I was standing by the munchies table
  trying not to embarrass myself too much, when a woman came up to me and
  pointed out this dip. She explained to me that at a previous party she had
  lost control eating it and got a spoon!
  
  It's incredibly rich, and requires a lot of will power not to eat too much.
  Yield:  Serves 6 gluttons.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 2 hours cooling.

      6 oz Chocolate chips                          -whole pecans)
           -(semi-sweet)                     1/2 C  Sugar (white,
  2 1/2 C  Vanilla wafers,                          -granulated)
           -crushed fine (a box              1/4 C  Corn syrup
           -less some nibbles)               1/3 C  Cognac (Use the best
      1 C  Pecans (finely chopped;                  -you can afford,
           -start with 8-10 oz                      -it makes a difference!)
 
  Melt chocolate bits.  If you have never worked with melted chocolate
  before, then use a double boiler with the burner set on low.
  
  Crush vanilla wafers very fine (fineness is important).  Chop pecans (again
  fineness is everything).  Add sugar, corn syrup and cognac (I use 1 nip of
  cognac and  1/2 nip of rum, works fine and costs less).  Stir in pecans and
  wafer crumbs.  Now you learn why you were supposed to grind them very
  finely.
  
  By now the mixture should be a smooth paste.  Remove from heat and form
  into about 1-inch balls. Roll balls in extra granulated sugar.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich chocolate no-bake cookie -- A terrific, very rich, no-bake
  cookie. Adapted from a recipe in the "Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook."
  Yield: makes 3-4 dozen.
  
  *  Store these in an air-tight container; if you are a chocoholic, have
  someone hide them from you.  They are best if you allow  them to age and
  mellow.
  
  : Difficulty:  Moderate to hard (melted chocolate is tricky, and rolling
  the mixture into balls takes practice).
  : Time:  30-60 minutes or more, depending on how deftly you can roll the
  balls.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: AUNTY BETTY'S BOMBE
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 C  Double cream                        6 oz Chocolate, plain
    1/3 C  Sugar                               3    Egg yolks
      4 T  Water                          
 
  Whisk 1/2 of the cream until stiff and spread it around the edges of a
  large bowl. Freeze for 1/2 to 1 hour.
  
  Dissolve the sugar in the water, bring to the boil and simmer for 3 minutes
  until syrupy.  Meanwhile, break chocolate into blender or warm bowl.
  
  Pour the hot sugar syrup onto the chocolate and blend or whisk until the
  chocolate has all melted.  Add the egg yolks and mix the whole lot
  thoroughly.
  
  Whisk the remaining cream into soft peaks and fold gently into the
  chocolate mixture. Pour into the centre of the frozen cream and freeze for
  several hours until solid. Cover when fully frozen.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A high-cholesterol chocolate dessert -- This recipe comes from a
  friend's aunt. It always seems to taste wonderful no matter how sloppily I
  measure things. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  Although the recipe "serves 4-6," two people will happily eat the whole
  thing.
  
  *  The outside is frozen solid, so you may find a fork useful for breaking
  your portion into pieces without showering fellow diners with fragments. It
  could be served in small portions, but don't count on having any left over.
  
  *  Double cream has more than 45 percent butterfat.  It is difficult to
  find cream in North America that is richer than whipping cream, which is
  typically 32 percent butterfat. If you can find heavy cream it is likely to
  be 36 percent. Use the richest cream you can find.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHOCOLATE PANCAKES
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 3 dozen
 
    3/4 C  Margarine                           2 t  Vanilla
    3/4 C  Cocoa                             1/2 t  Salt
      2 C  Flour                             1/2 C  Butter cream
  1 1/2 C  Sugar                                    -frosting
      4    Eggs                           
 
  Melt the margarine and mix with the cocoa.
  
  In a small bowl, mix flour and salt.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs.  Then add sugar, vanilla, and beat well.
  Add flour and margarine mixture to this and blend thoroughly.
  
  Heat skillet to medium-low.  Drop small clumps (about 1 T) and cook like
  pancakes:  about 1 1/2 minutes on one side, 1/2 minute on the other, then
  turn over again and remove after a few seconds. Freeze. When relatively
  hard, coat one side with buttercream frosting.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Brownies in a skillet -- This recipe is based on a "chocolate turtle"
  recipe by Mae Rabenius from a cookbook produced by Faith United Methodist
  Church in Phoenix, Arizona.  Yield:  40 pieces.
  
  *  One side of the pancakes may burn.  It doesn't particularly affect the
  taste, and if you frost this side, no one will even know.
  
  *  It's not necessary to cook the pancakes completely; if the middle looks
  somewhat gooey, don't fret:  it will soon harden.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes to cook, 10 minutes to frost.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHOCOLATE CRACKLES
 Categories: Desserts, Australian, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8 oz Copha                               5 C  Rice Bubbles
      8 oz Icing sugar                       1/2 C  Sultanas (optional)
  3 1/2 t  Cocoa                          
 
  Combine sifted icing sugar, cocoa, rice bubbles and optional sultanas. Melt
  copha and add to ingredients and mix thoroughly.  Spoon into paper cups and
  allow to set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A traditional Australian sweet snack -- Mention this recipe to an
  Australian abroad and he will instantly get homesick.  Yield:  serves 6.
  
  *  Rice Bubbles are called Rice Krispies in North America.  Icing sugar is
  confectioner's sugar.  Sultanas are like raisins.  Copha, it would appear,
  is utterly unavailable outside Australia. It is a partially-solidified
  shortening made of coconut oil.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you can get the ingredients.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: STEVE'S CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 2 dozen
 
    1/2 lb Butter (2 sticks)               2 1/2 C  Flour, all-purpose
  1 1/2 C  Dark brown sugar                    1 t  Baking soda
      2    Eggs                                1 lb Chocolate chips
      2 t  Vanilla extract                
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl
  until creamy. Spend some time and make sure it is well mixed. Add eggs and
  vanilla and mix well. Add flour and soda, again mixing well. Add chocolate
  chips. If it doesn't look like enough, then add some more.
  
  Make big, thick cookies, big enough so that you get only 2 dozen of them
  out of this recipe. Put them on a lightly-greased baking sheet. Put the
  cookies in the oven, close the door quickly, and turn the heat down to 350
  degrees F. Bake for 10 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rich, thick, crunchy chocolate chip cookies.  Yield:  makes 2 dozen.
  
  *  The use of real ingredients instead of imitation ingredients cannot be
  overemphasized.  Chocolate-flavored chips, margarine, vanilla flavoring and
  other such atrocities will completely destroy this recipe.  I use Challenge
  butter and Ghirardelli chocolate.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have a machine that can cream sugar and butter,
  moderate otherwise.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking, 10 minutes cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: CHEWY CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 5 dozen
 
      2 C  Butter                              2 t  Baking soda
      2 C  Sugar (granulated,                  2 t  Baking powder
           -white)                            24 oz Chocolate chips
      2 C  Brown sugar                              -(being a purist,
           -(dark brown)                            -I prefer Toll House
      4 lg Eggs                                     -morsels)
      2 t  Vanilla extract                     8 oz Chocolate bar,
      4 C  Flour (sift                              -finely grated
           -before measuring)                  3 C  Chopped nuts
      5 C  Rolled oats (oatmeal),                   -(I prefer walnuts,
           -powdered finely                         -but use your favorite)
      1 t  Salt                           
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the sugars.
  
  Sift together flour, oatmeal, salt, baking soda, baking powder and shredded
  chocolate bar.  Add eggs and vanilla to creamed sugar and butter, then mix
  all ingredients together. Mix chocolate chips and nuts into mixture.
  
  Drop by onto ungreased cookie sheet in small drops.  Bake 6 minutes or
  until done.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate Chip Cookies like Mrs. Fields makes -- These cookies are a
  combination of oatmeal and chocolate chip.  They are very rich, but very
  tasty.  The recipe was obtained from a friend of a friend, who supposedly
  paid a large amount of money for it. However, the cookies do not taste
  exactly the same as the name brand. Yield: approximately 60.
  
  *  A blender works very well to powder the oats and the chocolate bar.  The
  blender chops the oatmeal finer than a food processor.  The powdered
  chocolate bar should melt at the touch of your fingers.
  
  *  I prefer my cookies just barely done, so that they remain chewy.  If you
  want to send your taste buds into heaven, butter the cookies as they come
  out of the oven (still hot), and eat them still warm with a glass of cold
  milk.
  
  *  Note that cocoa is not the same thing as a shredded chocolate bar.  Note
  also that oatmeal is not the same thing as quick-cooking oats or instant
  oatmeal.  Oatmeal means "rolled oats," such as Quaker oats.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.

      Title: CHOCOLATE FANTASY CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, No-bake, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      1 lb Tea biscuits                    2 1/2 C  Cream
           -(dry cookies)                      3 C  Milk
      3 T  Liqueur (chocolate                  3 pk Chocolate pudding
           -or coffee flavored)                     -(instant)
      3 T  Brandy                              1 pn Salt

----------------------------------FROSTING----------------------------------
      4 oz Chocolate, bittersweet              4 oz Chocolate, milk
 
  Arrange a layer of biscuits at the bottom of a large baking pan.
  
  Mix the brandy and liqueur in a small container and pour on top of the
  biscuits.  Whip the cream, milk, pudding and salt until the mixture is
  thick. Pour the mixture on top of the biscuits. Chill well. When the cream
  is cold, prepare the frosting by grating the chocolate onto the top of the
  cake. Refrigerate before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A no-bake chocolate cake -- This is a very simple, quick, no-bake cake
  for those of us who hate getting near an oven, but like delightful cheese
  cakes. This recipe is originally from the _Yediot Achronot_ (Latest News)
  newspaper supplement here in Israel. It should be prepared a day or two
  before you intend to eat it, so that the flavoring fills out. Definitely
  not for people on a diet. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  You can replace the milk and cream with about 1 1/2 lb of 9 percent milk
  fat cheese.  This is a product sold in Israel.  The nearest equivalent in
  North America is sour cream.  If you do this, replace the pudding with
  about 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup. If you are not a chocolate lover, you may
  replace the chocolate pudding with vanilla pudding (or with vanilla extract
  if you are using the 9 percent cheese)
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: STEVE'S CHILI
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 lb Ground beef                         2 t  Red pepper, crushed
      1 md Onion, chopped                    1/2 t  Black pepper, ground
      2    Garlic cloves,                      1 ds White pepper, ground
           -minced                             1 ds MSG
    1/2 t  Salt                                1 ds Oregano
     60 oz Tomato sauce                        1 ds Cloves, ground
      8 oz Green chilies,                      1 t  Sugar
           -diced (2 standard cans)                 Seasoned salt
      3    Tomatoes, sliced                    1 lb Red kidney beans
    1/4 C  Chili powder                        8 oz Pepperoni, sliced
    1/2 t  Allspice, ground               
 
  Fry together the ground beef, onion, garlic and some salt until the beef is
  browned.
  
  Meanwhile in a large kettle, mix together the tomato sauce, green chilies
  and tomatoes and heat over low heat. When the hamburger is done, mix in
  with tomato sauce mixture. Add the spices, salt and sugar, stir well, and
  adjust ingredients to taste. It will taste hotter later than it does now.
  
  Simmer for about 1.5 hours, and then add beans and pepperoni.  Simmer for
  30 minutes longer. Serve over rice, topped with shredded cheddar cheese.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple, prize-winning chili with beans -- This recipe is one I
  developed on my own. It has won several awards in chili cookoff contests.
  Yield: Serves 12-16.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  3 hours of intermittent attention.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: MOM'S CHILI
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Ground beef                         3    Garlic cloves
      2 lg Yellow onions,                           -(or more, to taste)
           -chopped                            1    Bay leaf
      1 lb Kidney beans                             Ketchup (1 "glub")
    1/2 lb Tomato paste                        1 T  Chili powder
      6 oz Water                                    -(or more to taste)
 
  Brown the meat and onions, separately if desired.  In a large, heavy pot,
  combine the meat and onions, and the other ingredients except the chili
  powder.  Simmer at least one hour.  Six or more hours is better.  Stir in
  the chili powder.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A mild, hearty chili -- This chili won't win any awards in Texas, but
  it's a nice, mild, flavorful dish. The recipe can easily be multiplied; I
  usually make a triple batch and freeze the excess. For a spicier chili, use
  more chili powder, or, even better, mix your own spices. Yield: Serves 4-5.
  
  *  I usually use more garlic; the cloves can be left whole and will become
  soft and mildly flavored by simmering.
  
  *  The flavor is best if the chili sits for a day before being served.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 to 6 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHICKEN-SAUSAGE GUMBO
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 5 servings
 
      1    Chicken, cut into                 1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
           -10 pieces                               Vegetable oil for
           Salt                                     -deep frying
           Garlic powder                       7 C  Chicken stock,
           Cayenne pepper                           -homemade or canned
      1 C  Onions, finely chopped            1/2 lb Andouille smoked
      1 C  Green bell pepper,                       -sausage, cut into
           -finely chopped                          -1/4-inch cubes
    3/4 C  Celery, finely chopped                   -(See note about
  1 1/4 C  Flour                                    -this ingredient)
    1/2 t  Salt                                1 t  Garlic
    1/2 t  Garlic powder                  
 
  Cut extra fat from the chicken pieces.  Sprinkle each generously on both
  sides with salt, garlic powder and cayenne, rubbing the spices in after all
  three have been applied. Let stand at room temperature while you chop the
  vegetables and heat the oil.
  
  Chop the onions, bell pepper and celery, combine in a bowl, and set aside.
  
  In a large, heavy skillet, heat about 1 to 1 1/2 inches of oil until very
  hot 375 degrees F. to 400 degrees F. Leave about 1/2 inch of space below
  the top of the pan, so it won't overflow when you add the chicken pieces
  later. Use a deep fry thermometer if you have one.
  
  While the oil is heating, combine the flour, about 1/2 t salt, about 1/2 t
  garlic powder and about 1/2 t cayenne in a paper bag.  When the oil is
  almost hot enough, add the chicken pieces one or two at a time and shake
  until they are well-coated. Save about 1/2 cup of the leftover flour.
  
  Put the stock in a large kettle or Dutch oven and begin heating it to a
  boil. Fry the chicken until the crust is brown on both sides and the meat
  is cooked. This takes about 6 minutes a side for light meat, a bit longer
  for dark. Drain on paper towels. You may have to fry the chicken in two
  batches.
  
  Pour the hot oil into a glass measuring cup, being very careful to leave as
  many of the browned particles as possible in the pan.  Pour about 1/2 cup
  of the oil back into the pan and discard the rest.
  
  Place the pan over high heat.  Using a whisk, gradually stir in the
  leftover flour. Cook, whisking constantly, until this roux is dark
  red-brown (about 4 minutes). Be very careful not to scorch the mixture, or
  to splash any onto your skin as you stir. Remove from the heat, add the
  vegetable mixture all at once and stir until the vegetables are all coated.
  Return the pan to low heat and cook, stirring constantly, for about 5
  minutes.
  
  Check that the stock has reached a boil.  Add the vegetable mixture to the
  stock in spoonfuls, stirring with the whisk after each addition.  Return to
  a boil and stir in the andouille and the minced garlic. Simmer uncovered
  for about 45 minutes.
  
  While the gumbo is cooking, remove the skin from the chicken pieces, and
  cut off as much meat as you can. Cut the meat into small pieces (about 1/2
  inch cubes). When the gumbo is cooked, add the chicken meat.
  
  The original recipe did not call for this, but I take time to spoon off the
  fat from the top of the gumbo.  This is mostly oil, which does not solidify
  when you chill it.  You should be able to take off at least 1/2 cup.
  
  To serve as a main course, mound about 1/2 cup of cooked gumbo-style rice
  in a soup bowl, and ladle about 1 1/4 cups gumbo around the rice. For an
  appetizer, use about 1 T of rice and about     3/4 cup of gumbo.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Gumbo with chicken and Andouille sausage -- This is a recipe that I got
  originally from Paul Prudhomme's cookbook, "The Louisiana Kitchen."  It is
  a classic Louisiana dish. Serve with gumbo-style rice.
  
  *  Note about Andouille (pronounced an-DOO-ee) sausage:  this is a uniquely
  spiced, smoked sausage made mostly in Louisiana.  If you can get some, then
  use it; it makes a substantial difference to the recipe to use it.  If you
  can't, then try the Polish sausage kielbasa  as a substitute.  Do not
  substitute the sausage called "Louisiana Sausage" or "Louisiana Hot
  Sausage." It's not the same thing.

      Title: CHICKEN BROTH
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 16 cups
 
      1    Stewing chicken                     1    Parsley bunch
           -(or 2 broilers                     1    Thyme bunch, fresh
           -and a stick of butter)                  -(or a teaball with
     16 C  Water                                    -about 1/2 t dried
      1 lg Yellow onion                             -thyme inside)
      1    Bay leaf                       
 
  Take one large, heavy, lidded pan; mine is a six-quart enamelled cast-iron
  Copco pan with 20 years' good cooking already logged, and I live in terror
  that yuppie burglars will break into my house some night and steal it.  Put
  into it one fat old chicken.  If you live in a part of the world where
  there are no fat old chickens for sale, put in two scrawny young chickens
  and a stick of butter.
  
  Put the pan in a cold oven, turn the temperature to 325 degrees F. and wait
  patiently, doing nothing whatsoever to the chicken, for about four hours,
  till it's dark golden.
  
  Take the pot out of the oven and let it cool to room temperature.  Strip
  the meat off the bones. Cover everything, meat and bones, with about a
  gallon of water at room temperature. Add a raw onion, peeled and quartered,
  a bay leaf, a bunch of parsley tied together with string, and a small bunch
  of thyme similarly tied or a teaball with dried thyme leaves in it. Bring
  the water up to a simmer and let it just simmer (make a mirror, as the
  French say) for ten minutes. Turn it off and return it to room temperature
  again.
  
  Take the meat out.  It is not as good as it was before the wee simmer, but
  perfectly satisfactory for chicken salad or on waffles with creamed chicken
  or whatever. Waste not want not.
  
  Add another quart of water, bring the broth back up to a simmer and simmer
  it for twenty minutes. Strain out the bones and vegetables. You should have
  about four quarts.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rich homemade chicken broth -- Surely people who make use of bouillon
  cubes have no idea how easy home-made broth can be. This is not a
  traditional method, but it produces good results.
  
  *  I've never had good luck freezing broth (it starts to taste thinnish),
  so this is as much as I ever make at once. I keep it in the refrigerator in
  quart Mason canning jars.  I've read that you should simmer saved broth for
  twenty minutes every four or five days, but it never lasts that long in my
  house, so I can't comment.
  
  *  I use a cup wherever a recipe calls for a cup of chicken broth.  And
  then, after it's been around for a day or two, somebody suggests we really
  haven't had chicken soup with rice for a long, long time... or matzoh
  dumplings... or tortellini in brodo... and then it's all gone.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH BASIL SAUCE
 Categories: Poultry, Australian, Herbs, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 lg Chicken fillets               

-------------------------------CRUMB TOPPING-------------------------------
      1 C  Bread crumbs, fresh                 3 oz Butter
    1/3 C  Parmesan, grated                    2    Garlic cloves
      1 T  Parsley, chopped                    2 t  Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 lb Bacon                             1/2 t  Mustard, dry

--------------------------------BASIL SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 C  Oil                                 1    Egg yolk
    1/4 C  White vinegar                       1 C  Basil leaves (fresh),
      1    Garlic clove, crushed                    -finely chopped
    1/2 C  Cream          
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Combine bread crumbs, cheese and parsley.
  Saute chopped bacon and drain on absorbent paper.  Add the bacon to the
  bread crumb mix. This is the crumb topping for the chicken.
  
  In a pan, melt the butter, then add the crushed garlic, Worcestershire
  sauce and mustard. Mix and heat through. Coat the chicken fillets with the
  butter mixture by dipping them in the saucepan. Arrange in a shallow,
  ovenproof dish. Press the bread crumb mixture on top of the chicken pieces
  to provide a crumb topping. Bake uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes.
  
  While the chicken cooks, make the basil sauce:  in a saucepan combine all
  sauce ingredients except the egg yolk.  Stir until heated and then add the
  egg yolk, stirring until thickened. Do not boil. Pour the hot sauce over
  the chicken pieces just before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Oven-baked chicken pieces with basil sauce -- This recipe came
  originally from "The Australian Women's Weekly Dinner Party Cookbook No.
  2," available at an Australian news agent near you.
  
  *  The sauce sounds unusual but tastes great.  The fresh basil gives it a
  good green colour. Serve with green, vegetables, such as beans and snow
  peas, or a leafy green salad for a colour-coordinated dinner.
  
  *  The finer the ingredients in the topping the better will be its effect.

      Title: KUNG PAO CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Chinese, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 lb Chicken breast, boned           1 1/2 t  Red pepper, crushed
           -and cut into shreds              1/2 C  Skinless peanuts
           Cornstarch                        1/2 C  Bamboo shoots, diced
      1    Egg white                         1/2 C  Pea pods
      1    Garlic clove, minced              1/2 C  Straw mushrooms
      1    Ginger piece, minced                     Oil

-----------------------------------SAUCE:-----------------------------------
      2 T  Brown bean sauce                    2 t  Rice cooking wine
      1 T  Hoisin sauce                             -(or use dry sherry)
      1 t  Sugar                               2 T  Water
 
  Dust chicken breast with cornstarch and massage in egg white.  Mix sauce
  ingredients.
  
  Heat oil in wok and stir-fry peanuts briefly.  Remove from pan.  Stir-fry
  chicken about two minutes.  Remove from pan.
  
  Pour in red pepper, garlic and ginger.  Fry until peppers begin to change
  color.  Add pea pods, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, chicken and sauce.  Stir
  and cook 1 minute. Add peanuts, toss and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Stir-fried chicken with vegetables -- This recipe is from a Szechuan
  cooking class taught by Susan Newberry, Minnetonka, Minnesota.
  
  *  The original recipe said the mushrooms and pea pods are optional but I
  found that they are a must.  The cornstarch and egg white act to seal the
  moisture so the chicken does not get dry.  This gives the chicken a very
  different texture.  I feel this is the way to stir fry chicken.  But make
  sure that you do not let the chicken and egg white stand for more than 5
  minutes, otherwise the egg white starts to run. Raw skinless peanuts are
  best, but you can also use blanched peanuts. The hoisin sauce and bean
  sauce are available at any oriental grocery store and at some supermarkets.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: SUPER-BOWL CHILI
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Steak, cheap                             -minced (2-6)
           -(not too fatty)                         Arbole or serrano
      1 lb Tomatoes, stewed                         -peppers (dried),
      1 lb Tomatoes, whole                          -whole (2-6)
    1/2 lb Tomato sauce                        3    Anaheim or California
      1 C  Water (or beer)                          -(large) chilis,
    1/4 C  Chili seasoning                          -chopped coarse
           -(*see note below)                  1    Bell pepper, red or
      1 lg Red onion,                               -green (optional)
           -chopped coarse                     2 T  Brown sugar
      2    Garlic cloves,                      1 t  Salt
           -minced or crushed                  2 t  Black pepper
           Jalapeno peppers                    4 T  Masa flour
           -(fresh), seeded and                2 C  Pinto beans, cooked
 
  Trim the meat of all visible fat.  If there is a large strip of fat on one
  side of the meat, save it whole.  Cut meat into 1/4-inch cubes and brown it
  in a frying pan.
  
  In a large chili pot, place tomatoes, tomato sauce and water or beer. Bring
  to a slow boil.  Add the meat, chili seasoning, onion, garlic, peppers,
  sugar, salt and pepper. If you are using the optional bell pepper, cut it
  into 1-inch strips and add them now. If you have that large piece of steak
  fat, add it now; if not, add about 1 T of cooking oil. Cover and reduce
  heat, simmer at least one hour (two to three is better) stirring
  occasionally. At the end of the simmering remove and discard the piece of
  steak fat.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A hearty (and hot) Texas-style chili -- This is a chili traditional in
  our Super-Bowl Sunday festivities. It has won several "no holds barred"
  (non ICS) chili cookoffs where there are no specific rules. It is the
  result of countless changes and adjustments of a small group of chili
  aficionados (aka chiliheads). Note: there is a range of peppers specified,
  you may adjust the "temperature" of the resultant chili, mild if you use
  the low end, or nuclear if you use the high end (we do!). Yield: serves
  6-8.
  
  *  Mix the masa flour with about 1/4 cup water and add to chili pot along
  with the pinto beans (or any kind you prefer). Simmer an additional 30
  minutes. Serve. If you have made the nuclear version, make sure there is
  plenty of beer on hand.
  
  *  For chili seasoning, we make up batches consisting of 8 parts chili
  powder, 2 parts ground cumin, and 1 part crushed (not ground) cayenne
  peppers.

      Title: PILAF WITH SOUR CHERRIES AND LENTILS
 Categories: Grains, Middle east, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 C  Basmati rice (*)                    2 C  Chicken or meat
      2    Onions, peeled                           -broth (*)
           -(thinly sliced)                    4 T  Butter, unsalted,
    1/2 C  Red lentils (*)                          -or more
      7 oz Sour cherries,                           Turmeric, cumin, salt
           -or more  (*)                  
 
  In a 4-5 quart Dutch oven, melt most of the butter and slowly brown the
  onions.  Add the cleaned lentils and fry a bit; then the same for the
  cleaned rice. Stir constantly, browning the rice without letting it stick.
  
  Add the cherries and about 2 1/4 cups liquid made up of cherry liquid,
  stock and water. Add about 1/4 - 1 t turmeric and about 1/4 t ground cumin
  if desired; add necessary salt (depending on the saltiness of your broth).
  
  Bring to a boil, stir with a fork, cover tightly, and let cook over the
  very lowest heat for about 20 minutes. Fluff up the rice with a fork (never
  a spoon) and add the remaining butter to the bottom of the pot.
  
  Raise the heat slightly for 5-10 mins to form a crust on the bottom (with
  the right technique, this should be possible without this step...). Serve,
  making sure to include a bit of crust in each serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pilaf with sour cherries and lentils -- This Pilaf with sour cherries
  and lentils is a Persian-style dish, although I cannot vouch for its
  authenticity. It is rich enough to eat for dinner by itself; as a side
  dish, it might be good with a spiced grilled chicken or a lamb stew. It is
  a composite of recipes from cookbooks and from a Iranian Jewish family I
  know.
  
  *  An excellent side dish is yoghurt, possibly flavored (like the Indian
  raita) with one or more of:  fresh chopped herbs (parsley, coriander,
  mint), some salt, some spice (paprika, black pepper, black onion seed, or
  coriander seed), olive oil and lemon juice. Even better than yoghurt as a
  base is strained yoghurt, also called Lebany Spread or Lebanee, available
  commercially in New England from Columbo or Eunuch (look in
  Armenian/Arab/Greek stores).
  
  *  Basmati or Patna rice is a particularly flavorful and long-grained rice
  from India or Pakistan.  Any Indian store and many "natural foods" stores
  carry it.  It is well worth the premium price (about $1.10 a pound);
  "Texmati" is apparently the same strain grown in Texas, but does not have
  anything like the same taste. Inspect and clean it before using, there are
  often unhusked grains and occasionally pebbles mixed in. Then rinse in two
  changes of water and drain thoroughly. If you cannot get Basmati, use a
  good-quality unconverted long-grain rice (Alma, Carolina, but NOT Uncle
  Ben's!).
  
  *  Red lentils are about half the diameter of ordinary brown lentils.  Do
  not substitute brown lentils, which will probably not cook fast enough. Red
  lentils are available in Indian, Middle Eastern and some "natural foods"
  stores.  They often contain largish pebbles, so inspect them carefully.
  Rinse to get rid of dust, and drain. Red lentils are also very good by
  themselves, simply boiled with a few spices and served with butter.
  
  *  Sour cherries (in the Middle East, v/w + i + s/sh + n + e/a/ino:  Greek
  Vissino, Slavic and Turkish Vishnea, Arabic Wishna) are available fresh for
  about one week a year.  Most sour cherries go into cherry syrups, pies and
  preserves.  Canned sour cherries are quite good.  You will usually find
  them in the home pie-making section of your market, near the canned
  blueberries and baker's supplies, or with the canned fruits. There are
  occasional stones. (That is, pits, not rocks!) Middle Eastern stores will
  often have sour cherry preserves, which are too sweet for this recipe.
  
  *  Almost any stock or broth will work in this recipe.  Chicken or lamb is
  most appropriate, in the latter case, used rather dilute.  This is one of
  the few recipes where you can actually get away with canned chicken broth,
  but watch the salt.

      1    Orange                              6 T  Oats (uncooked
      1 oz Margarine or butter                      -flake oatmeal)
 
  Grate the apple (including the skin, but not the core) and the skin of the
  orange into an ovenproof dish.  Mix in the juice of the orange and half the
  sugar.
  
  Melt the margarine in a saucepan over a low heat and mix in the oats and
  the rest of the sugar. Stir until thoroughly coated. Spread over the top of
  the apple mixture. Stand for one hour before cooking for 20-30 minutes at
  375 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Apple and orange pudding with oats on top -- From "Friends of the Earth
  Cookbook."  A really quick to prepare, juicy pudding - it's amazing the
  difference the orange makes.
  
  *  Try it with different toppings - crumble or cornflakes for example.

      Title: BIAGIO'S SPAGHETTI CARBONARA
 Categories: Pasta, Italian, Usenet
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      1 lb Spaghetti (thin),                 1/2 C  Cold water
           -rotini or equivalent             1/4 C  Italian white wine,
           -pasta                                   -dry
      2 T  Olive oil                           4    Eggs
    1/2 lb Pancetta or bacon                   4 T  Heavy cream
      1 md Yellow onion                        8 T  Parmesan cheese
           -(chopped)                               -(grated)
 
  Put large bowl in oven to warm at lowest possible setting.  Soak chopped
  onion in cold water for 15 minutes to reduce pungency. Chop Pancetta or
  bacon into 1/4-inch x 1-inch strips.
  
  Beat eggs and cream together with a fork.  Add about 4 T Parmesan cheese to
  the mixture.
  
  Wash pasta.  Put on water to cook pasta.  Add pasta when boiling.  In the
  meantime...
  
  Dry onions and saute with pancetta or bacon in olive oil until onions are
  barely translucent.  Add wine and reduce heat when initial boiling ceases.
  Meat should not be crisp.
  
  When pasta is cooked, drain, but DO NOT WASH.  Quickly remove bowl from
  oven, put pasta in it and toss with egg, cream and cheese mixture so that
  heat from pasta cooks eggs. Add meat, onions and wine without draining fat
  and toss until thoroughly mixed. Sprinkle remaining cheese to taste, toss
  and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spaghetti Carbonara, Neapolitan Style -- My wife and I had the pleasure
  of staying at the Villa Virgiliana (owned by The Vergilian Society) in
  Cuma, Italy just outside of Naples in June, 1985. Biagio and Maria
  Sgariglia, the proprietors of the villa, served us excellent Italian farm
  meals for a week, each meal being more delicious than the last. This dish
  was the gastronomic highlight of our stay.
  
  *  Pasta should be cooked AL DENTE so that it offers resistance to the
  teeth without crunching. Fresh pasta is desirable (dried pasta is a poor
  imitation of the real thing.) Pasta should be used immediately when done so
  as to stop its internal cooking. If both portions of the recipe cannot be
  completed at the same time, the meat and onion mixture should finish first.
  
  *  I have made a very successful variation on this using hot country
  sausage. Make sure the sausage is fairly lean if you try it, however. All
  of the quantities are adjustable and may depend on the kind of pasta or
  meat you use. Too much cream will cause the egg mixture to separate from
  the pasta and meat. Too little cream will essentially give you scrambled
  eggs and bacon with pasta.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard (timing is critical).
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: BASMATI RICE PILAF
 Categories: Grains, Indian, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 C  Basmati rice (from                  2    Cloves
           -Indian grocery or                  4    Black peppercorns
           -gourmet shop)                    1/4 t  Cumin seeds
      1 sm Onion                               1 T  Light vegetable oil
      3 md Carrots                             2 T  Butter
      1    Bay leaf                            1 T  Kosher salt (or to taste)
 
  Wash the rice in cool water, squeezing gently with your fingers, until the
  water runs clear.  Put the rice in about 2 cups of cool water to soak for
  20 minutes. Strain soak water into saucepan and heat. Leave rice to dry in
  strainer.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  While rice is drying, chop onion finely and set aside.  Dice carrots and
  set aside. Measure spices.
  
  When rice is dry, heat oil over medium-high flame in heavy, oven-proof
  skillet or casserole dish. Add spices. When spices become fragrant, add
  butter and onions. Cook until onions are tender and light golden brown. Add
  carrots and cook for 3-5 minutes.
  
  Add rice and cook, stirring very gently for 5 minutes.  Add salt and heated
  soak water, bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until water on top of
  rice has boiled off. Cover tightly and cook for 20 minutes at 350 degrees
  F. Remove from oven, let rest for 10 minutes, then serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Basmati Rice with Carrots -- This is a delicate, fragrant rice dish, one
  of our favorites. I got the recipe from an Indian cooking class. It's a bit
  of work, but well worth it.
  
  *  It is important to handle the rice gently so that the grains are not
  broken.  It's also important to use whole spices; ground spices would
  overpower the rice.
  
  *  This dish can be re-heated in the oven.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: CHICKEN SOUP AVGOLEMONO
 Categories: Soups, Greek, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     64 oz Chicken broth                            -Chicken Bouillon cubes)
           -(You can get away                  4 T  White rice (unconverted,
           -with instant broth,                     -not Uncle Ben's!!!)
           -but make sure it is                2 lg Eggs
           -of good quality.                   1    Lemon
           -I usually use Knorr              1/2 t  Salt (or more to taste)
 
  Bring the broth to a boil and add the rice and salt.  Let rice cook for
  15-20 minutes. Remove pot from stove and let it cool for a while.
  
  Separate the whites from the egg yolks, and beat the whites in a large
  bowl, until they thicken a little. Add the yolks and the juice of the lemon
  and beat until you get a uniform mixture.
  
  Now carefully, using a ladle, pour some of the warm broth into the egg
  mixture, while beating continuously.  When your bowl is full, pour the
  contents back into the remaining broth, and stir until you get a uniform
  mixture.
  
  Now serve and, I hope, enjoy!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Greek style egg & lemon chicken soup -- Avgolemono in greek means egg
  and lemon and is the most popular technique for preparing soup in Greece.
  So much so, that unless stated otherwise, when one talks of soup, one means
  avgolemono soup. What follows is a recipe for my favourite, chicken soup,
  but feel free to substitute any kind of meat or fish broth for the chicken.
  Yield: Serves four -hungry- people.
  
  *  This process of treating eggs is known in greek as avgokomma, and
  describes both this process and what will happen if you are not very
  careful, the egg will coagulate and spoil everything! In order to avoid
  such an unfortunate occurrence, you must let the broth cool a little before
  adding the egg. This can easily be done by starting to beat the eggs only
  after you have removed the broth from the stove, thus giving time to the
  broth to cool.  However, if you're in a hurry, you can pour a small glass
  of cold water into the broth (which will obviously make the soup more
  diluted).  The broth must be poured slowly into the egg and lemon mixture,
  but the two must be blended quickly (use of an electric mixer is
  recommended).
  
  *  The original recipe does not require beating the whites separately, so
  you can simply beat the eggs whole until the whites blend with the yolks,
  and then add the lemon. If you prepare the eggs this way, the soup will be
  a little less smooth.
  
  *  The soup can be kept in the refrigerator for a day or two.  Be careful
  not to bring it to a boil when re-heating it, because the egg will
  coagulate.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (handling of egg whites in soup takes experience).
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: PENNSYLVANIA ALTAR BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
    7/8 C  Water, lukewarm                     1 pk Yeast (dry),
           -(about 110 degrees F.)                  -active
      3 T  Honey                           2 2/3 C  Flour, whole wheat
  1 1/2 t  Olive oil                                -(unsifted)
    1/2 t  Salt                           
 
  Combine water and yeast in mixing bowl.  Add honey, olive oil and salt. Add
  flour.  If flour does not completely dampen, add small amounts of water
  until all of the flour is damp. Be sparing with the water.
  
  Turn out onto a very lightly floured board and knead thoroughly for 5
  minutes until dough is extremely elastic.
  
  Sprinkle a tiny amount of olive oil in a big bowl, then roll the dough in
  it until the dough is covered with olive oil. Leave the dough in the bowl,
  cover with a cloth, and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Punch the dough down, knead again for a few
  seconds.  Roll the dough out with a rolling pin, as if you were making a
  pizza crust, to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
  
  Using something like a large peanut butter jar or a giant cookie cutter,
  cut out about 4-inch circles of the dough and lift them onto a
  slightly-oiled baking sheet. Press a cross into the top surface of each, so
  that it can be easily broken apart.
  
  Bake the loaves, on their baking sheet, in a preheated 350 degree F. oven
  for 10 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An earthy, whole-wheat bread used for communion -- In Pittsburgh and
  other Western Pennsylvania parishes of the Episcopal church, it is common
  to use small, thin loaves of real, fresh, home-made bread at communion
  instead of the pressed wafers popular in most other places. The bread has a
  chewy texture to it, keeps tremendously well, and makes a great lunchbox
  food (each "loaf" is about the size a large cookie). This recipe comes from
  Father Bill Coats of the Church of the Redeemer in Pittsburgh. Yield: 8-10
  single-serving loaves.
  
  *  You can freeze these loaves easily; either put them in single-serving
  ziploc bags and use them for school lunches, or freeze a bunch in a large
  food-storage bag.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours rising, 10 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: POZOLE
 Categories: Soups, Southwest, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 lb Pork shoulder                       6    Garlic cloves
           -(or shoulder chops),               2 T  Chili powder
           -with bones in                           -(or more to taste)
     29 oz White hominy (one                   2 t  Salt
           -can), with packing juice      
 
  Put the pork shoulder piece(s) in a large kettle.  Don't bother to cut them
  up.  Cover with cold water, about 10 cups.  Slowly bring to a simmer,
  uncovered.  As it simmers for the first 10 minutes or so, skim off any scum
  that rises to the surface.  (It will stop appearing after this.)
  
  Simmer, partially covered, for at least two hours.  Don't let too much
  water boil away; just leave the lid a bit ajar so a small amount of steam
  can escape.
  
  Remove from heat.  Remove the pork pieces from the broth and cut the meat
  from the bones. Discard the bones. Cut the meat in medium chunks (whatever
  size is appropriate for stew) and return it to the broth.
  
  Crush or mince the garlic.  Add the hominy with its juice, garlic, chili
  powder and salt to the pork and broth.  Adjust the chili powder to your
  taste. The estimate here is for a mild store-bought unblended spice and
  will produce a mild pozole. If you grind your own chiles, they may be
  hotter.  If you use a blend of chili powder and other spices (which is not
  recommended), you will probably want to reduce the salt. Remember that
  chili powder becomes mellowed and less spicy as it cooks.
  
  Return to heat and simmer (partially covered as before) for another two
  hours. By this time, some of the meat will still be in chunks, and some
  will be shredded. Skim the grease from the top; there may be quite a bit.
  Check for salt before serving. (Don't try to add anything else at the end;
  chili powder and garlic need time to cook.)
  
  I serve this with corn tortillas, wrapped in foil and warmed in the oven
  for ten or fifteen minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple New Mexican holiday stew -- This stew is from New Mexico.  It
  is traditionally served on special days, such as Christmas Eve or New
  Year's Eve.
  
  *  An alternate way of cooking the stew is to simmer the pork for at least
  one hour, remove the bones and add the other ingredients as described
  above, and cook covered in a slow oven (275 (135 ) for several hours.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

           -(1/2 inch)                    
 
  MAKE CURRY:  Fry the onion in a heavy casserole in the corn oil until it
  begins to soften.  Stir in the garlic, ginger and chilies.  Reduce heat and
  fry gently for awhile.
  
  Meanwhile, toast the hard seeds and cinnamon in a dry heavy frying pan
  until they begin to pop. Grind the toasted seeds into a fine powder and add
  to the frying mixture together with the chile powder and the turmeric.
  
  Add the chopped tinned tomatoes and stir in with about 1 t salt.  If the
  mixture is dry, add a little water or stock.  Cover and allow to simmer
  gently for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
  
  Trim the fat off the pre-cooked meat and cut into bite sized pieces.  When
  the sauce has simmered for the 2 hours, switch off and stir in the meat.
  Leave to stand preferably overnight, and re-heat before eating.
  
  MAKE RICE:  Heat corn oil in a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Add
  cloves, crushed cardamom pods and cinnamon.  Add rice and turmeric and mix
  well by swishing the pan round.  Add boiling water and bay leaf and stir.
  
  Cover and simmer gently for 12-15 minutes, until all the water has been
  absorbed.  Use a fork to remove the seeds and bay leaf and turn out into a
  warmed dish.  Allow to stand in a warm place for 5 to 10 minutes and fluff
  up with a fork before serving.
  
  The sauce can be prepared in advance, to use with leftover meat, or you can
  NOTES:
  
  *  An Indian-style meat curry -- Having experimented with making
  Indian-style dishes for a long time, I have found that this one works every
  time and has met with approval from all who have tried it. Yield: Serves
  3-4.
  
  *  cook the meat and sauce to order.
  
  *  Plain yoghurt may be substituted for the tomatoes if preferred.
  
  *  Experiment with the seasonings.  As a guide, ginger and chile powder
  will increase the heat, coriander will increase the sweetness, and
  fenugreek and cumin will increase the bitterness.

      Title: SPINACH AND CHEESE CURRY
 Categories: Entrees, Indian, Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Spinach, fresh                    1/2 t  Turmeric
    1/2 lb Ricotta cheese,                   1/2 t  Red chile powder
           -fresh (see note)                        -(cayenne; more to taste)
      3 md Brown onions                        2    Cloves
           Ginger, fresh                       1 pn Nutmeg
           -(1 1/2 inches),                    1 pn Mace
           -chopped fine                       1 T  Ghee (or use
      1 md Tomato                                   -melted butter or oil)
  1 1/2 t  Cumin seeds                              Salt (to taste)
 
  Cook the spinach and chop it up.  Cut the cheese into about     3/4-inch
  cubes and deep fry a few pieces at a time in oil (a wok is good for this).
  
  Fry the chopped onions in the ghee.  When almost brown, add the
  finely-chopped ginger. Use a medium to high heat. When the onions are
  golden, reduce the heat and add the skinned and chopped tomato, then the
  spices and salt. Cover for a few minutes, then add the spinach and salt.
  Cover and simmer about 5 minutes to let spices penetrate. Add the cheese
  pieces, mix and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indian vegetarian spinach and cheese curry -- This is a dish I learned
  from an Indian lady, at a cooking class. It's simple to make and has a
  beautifully subtle flavor. As per true curries, it uses raw spices instead
  of some prepackaged curry powder. Yield: Serves 4 to 6.
  
  *  We eat this dish as a meal with rice, although you can use it as  one
  dish along with others.
  
  *  The quantities given for the spinach and cheese are very flexible.  I
  never measure or weigh them, just putting in what seems right. Experiment.
  Similarly, it can be kept hot for a while with no loss in taste or texture.
  
  *  In North America, most Ricotta cheese is packed as a pot cheese.  This
  recipe calls for a more solid form of the cheese.  Specialty ethnic markets
  in large cities will carry solid Ricotta. You can make your own by buying a
  tub of pot Ricotta and wrapping it in a clean cloth to wick the moisture
  out, leaving the whole assembly in the refrigerator for a week or so, and
  changing the cloth every day. With such treatment the cheese will gradually
  solidify enough that you can slice and fry it. Buffalo-milk Mozzarella is a
  fair substitute, and ordinary Mozzarella is a last-chance substitute.
  
  *  Don't fry the cheese too long.  It should have a golden exterior and
  have a marshmallow texture inside. Frying too long makes it hard and dry.
  
  *  Use whole cumin seeds and cloves, not the ground variety.
  
  *  Like most curries, this reheats splendidly.

      Title: ZUCCHINI SHREDS WITH GINGER
 Categories: Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 T  Vegetable oil                       1 md Tomato (ripe),
      1 t  Cumin, whole                             -peeled, seeded
      1 T  Ginger, shredded                         -and shredded
      1 T  Green chili peppers,            1 1/2 t  Lemon juice
           -shredded                                Salt to taste
      1 lb Zucchini, cut into                  1 T  Coriander (fresh),
           -long thin strips                        -chopped
           -(about 1/8 x 3 inches)        
 
  Heat the oil in a large frying pan over high heat for 3 minutes.  Add the
  cumin, let the oil darken slightly (about 10 seconds) and add ginger and
  chili.  Cook for 30 seconds, stirring frequently.
  
  Add the zucchini and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes.  Add tomato during the last
  2 minutes of cooking.
  
  Turn off the heat.  Sprinkle lemon juice and salt to taste, mix, transfer
  to a serving plate and garnish with coriander.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Zucchini with ginger and chili peppers -- This is a nice spicy vegetable
  dish.  It goes well with fish, especially catfish.  I've always used
  zucchini, though it works as well with carrots or cucumbers. You can serve
  it as an appetizer or as a side dish, hot or cold. The recipe is originally
  from _Travel & Leisure_ magazine. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  I've found that this recipe works best if you use small zucchini, so
  that each slice has some peel (skin?) attached. Center slices without
  peel/skin fall apart.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes.

      Title: SAMBAL BAJAK
 Categories: Condiments, Indonesian, Usenet
      Yield: 1 cup
 
    1/2 lb Red hot chilies (fresh),          1/2 t  Laos powder
           -chopped coarsely                   1 T  Trasi (dried

      6    Garlic cloves                       1 t  Salt
      8    Kemiri nuts,                        5 T  Tamarind liquid
           -chopped fine                       2 T  Sugar
      3 T  Peanut oil                     
 
  Chop the chilies, onion and garlic in a food processor.  In a small frying
  pan, saute this mixture in oil until well-cooked.  Do not brown.  Add the
  kemiri nuts, laos, trasi and salt.  Stir and mash until it is well blended.
  Add the tamarind liquid and sugar; simmer until the oil separates out. Cool
  and serve cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fried chili-pepper sambal relish -- Indonesia is not known to have
  nuclear weapon capability, but visitors to Djakarta often suspect that if
  enough Sambal Bajak is put into an artillery shell it will have the same
  general effect. Indonesian hosts normally warn Westerners that this is "an
  acquired taste."
  
  *  Laos is a form of ginger.  Other names for it are galangal, Java root,
  galingale, or lengkuas.  If you can't find it, use about 1 t of powdered
  ginger mixed with about 1/4 t of powdered cinnamon.  Trasi is shrimp paste;
  it can be left out. Tamarind liquid is made by soaking dried tamarind pulp
  in hot water for 1 hour and then straining. To make about 5 T of tamarind
  liquid, use about 1/4 cup of pulp and about 1/2 cup of hot water.

      3 oz Mushrooms, sliced              
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Mix all ingredients together well, shape
  into loaf and put into a pan. If you use a roasting rack instead of a bread
  pan, the loaf will be less greasy and you can use some of the drippings to
  make the sauce. Bake 20 minutes uncovered at 425 degrees F. Turn down the
  oven to 375 degrees F. and continue baking, uncovered, for 55 more minutes.
  
  MAKE THE SAUCE:  Fry the mushrooms in the drippings and then combine the
  drippings and mushrooms with the mushroom soup and sour cream.  Heat this
  mixture in a sauce pan.  When meatloaf is done, put on a plate, cover with
  sauce, slice and eat.

  soak, submerge beans in about 6 cups of cold water salted to taste and soak
  6-8 hours or overnight, unrefrigerated.  For quick soak, submerge beans in
  about 6 to 8 cups of hot water salted to taste.  Bring to a boil, boil 3
  minutes, remove from heat, and soak 1 hour.  Whichever method you choose,
  make sure you use a pot large enough to let the beans expand 2 1/2 times,
  and drain and rinse the beans after soaking.
  
  Put the beans in a large pot.  Add boiling water, garlic, onion, salt,
  thyme and marjoram. Cover and simmer until the beans are tender (2 1/2 to 3
  hours). Don't let beans boil dry. Add hot water as needed.
  
  Spoon out 3 cups of the cooked beans to use another day in another way.
  Mash the rest of the beans with their liquid. Add remaining ingredients,
  plus about 1 cup of hot water. Heat at least 10 minutes to blend flavors.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A variation of chili con carne with beans -- I got this recipe from "A
  Primer on Bean Cookery" by the California Dry Bean Council and other
  organizations.  Yield:  Makes 5 to 6 cups.
  
  *  I'm not sure why the recipe doesn't call for you to cook a smaller
  quantity of beans, rather than spooning out the cooked beans. The pamphlet
  says that you can make the excess beans into a salad by covering them with
  French dressing and refrigerating. I think they're trying to sell more
  beans.
  
  *  Chili powder is a spice from Texas and Mexico consisting mainly of
  ground dried chili peppers.
  
  *  Green chili salsa is a Mexican condiment made from hot green chilies,
  onions, vinegar, salt and other ingredients.
  
  *  The slow soak method gives beans a better texture.  Since these beans
  will be mashed, it won't make much difference, unless you're concerned
  about those 3 extra cups of cooked beans you will make into a salad.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy
  : Time:  3 to 3 1/2 hours when done by the quick-soak method, overnight if
  slow-soak.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: WHITE OSSO BUCCO
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 sl Veal shank, each about                   -(or less)
           -1 1/2 - 2 inches thick             1    Lemon
    1/4 C  Olive oil                           8 T  Parsley (fresh),
    1/3 C  Butter, unsalted                         -chopped fine
      3 C  White wine, dry                          Flour, salt and pepper
 
  Dredge the veal shank pieces well in flour.  In a large skillet with high
  sides, heat the olive oil and butter over moderately high heat until the
  butter stops foaming.  If you do not have a skillet large enough to
  accommodate all of the meat in a single layer, use two smaller pans.
  
  Add the veal shanks to the skillet and arrange in a single layer.  Cook
  over moderately high heat until browned on one side. Add a generous amount
  of salt and pepper. Turn meat and brown the other side, and add salt and
  pepper.
  
  Add enough white wine to nearly, but not quite, cover the meat.  Reduce
  heat to a barely bubbling simmer. Cover with a well-fitting lid. Cook at a
  simmer for 2 1/2 hours.
  
  Peel a thin layer of rind from the lemon.  (I find that a vegetable peeler
  gives me a nice thin layer of rind.)  Cut rind into fine strips.
  
  Remove veal shanks to a warm plate.  The meat will be falling-off-the-bone
  tender, so a wide spatula is advised for this step to keep each shank
  intact. Keep meat warm through the next several steps.
  
  Add lemon peel and chopped parsley to the sauce and place over high heat.
  Boil vigorously for several minutes to reduce sauce slightly.  Stir to
  loosen any brown bits from the pan and then frequently to prevent burning.
  
  Remove from heat and return shanks to skillet.  Spoon sauce over shanks and
  replace skillet lid.  Let sit for 3-5 minutes to reheat shanks.  Serve with
  sauce over shanks.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Braised veal shanks in white wine -- This recipe is adapted from
  Marcella Hazan's "More Classic Italian Cooking." Simple to make, this dish
  beats any "traditional" osso bucco with tomatoes and vegetables that I've
  had in the U.S. or Italy.
  
  *  Veal shanks are a relatively inexpensive cut of meat.  If possible, ask
  your butcher to use hind shanks which have more meat than do the forelegs.
  The key to this dish is the quality of the ingredients.  I use the best
  olive oil (Italian, virgin first-press, cold-press) and table quality dry
  white wine (fume or sauvignon blanc) I can find at a reasonable price.
  
  *  For dredging, rather than using a plate of flour, I put about 2/3 cup
  flour in a plastic bag, put in the shanks one at a time, and shake to
  thoroughly cover all sides of the meat with flour.
  
  *  The flavor of the dish is light so I usually serve with a home-made
  pasta dish with a cream-based sauce and a steamed green vegetable. Be sure
  to have plenty of crusty bread on hand to soak up the sauce. For those who
  like the marrow, don't forget to spoon it out of the shanks.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: BAKLAVA
 Categories: Desserts, Balkan, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      1 lb Strudel dough                            -well-melted (salted
           -(or fillo leaves)                       -butter (or margarine)
      1 lb Butter, unsalted,                        -is not acceptable)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 lb Walnut meat,                        1 t  Vanilla (or use
           -chopped medium-fine                     -vanilla sugar)
    1/4 C  Sugar                         

-----------------------------------SYRUP-----------------------------------
      4 C  Sugar                               1 t  Lemon juice
      2 C  Water                          
 
  Heat oven to 300 degrees F. to 325 degrees F.
  
  MAKE THE SYRUP:  Boil the water and sugar for 15 minutes.  Add lemon juice,
  boil 10 more minutes, set aside to cool.
  
  MAKE THE FILLING:  Mix all ingredients well.  I prefer the walnuts fairly
  coarse; some people like them quite fine.
  
  BUILD THE BAKLAVA:  Cut the dough with scissors to the size of the tray.
  Handle the dough very carefully; do not press hard on it at any time. Cover
  with wax paper and damp towel.
  
  Take out one sheet of dough at a time and place it in the pan.  Brush the
  dough with melted butter between each layer.  Continue until you have about
  12 sheets buttered. Small and broken pieces of dough can be used in the
  center, but there must be butter between every two layers.
  
  Spread walnut filling across the tray.  Put on a sheet of dough, brush on
  butter and continue until all the dough is used up.
  
  Cut into diamond shapes:  cut into quarters with cuts parallel to the long
  axis, then cut diagonally across.  Don't press hard!
  
  Bake for about 1 1/2 hour, until golden brown.  Be careful not to burn the
  bottom or the walnuts, especially with a glass pan.
  
  Let cool on rack for 5 minutes.  Add syrup which should have cooled to room
  temperature.  Let cool for at least two hours before eating.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An incredibly sweet and wonderful Balkan dessert -- Baklava is claimed
  by almost every Balkan state as its own invention; most people in the
  United States first encounter it in Greek restaurants. If the truth were
  known, it's probably the Turkish who invented it, as is the case for many
  other "typically Greek" dishes. This recipe comes from my Bulgarian
  grandmother and follows Bulgarian tradition, in that the filling is very
  simple.  Yield:  Makes two small pans.
  
  *  Probably the hardest thing about this recipe is waiting those last two
  hours!
  
  *  Depending on where you go, you'll hear the name of this dish pronounced
  different ways.  I pronounce the name with all /ah/ sounds, with accents of
  equal intensity on both the first and third syllable.  The second syllable
  is quite faint. Greek-speaking persons typically put a heavy accent on the
  second syllable.
  
  *  Many variations on the filling are to be found.  A simple one was
  mentioned above, regarding the coarseness of grind of the walnuts in the
  filling. They may even be ground. Spices such as chopped cloves or cinnamon
  may be added and the filling may be included in several layers instead of
  just one.
  
  *  A large (14 x 10 inch) pan is almost too big to handle.  I typically
  make this recipe in two 7 3/4 x 11 inch pans, which is just about the size
  of a half sheet of the dough I buy. By the way, if you can make your own
  strudel dough, it will be even better... but much more effort.
  
  *  It is best to have a partner help you prepare the pans.  One person
  handles the dough and places it in the pan, while the other applies the
  butter. It is very important that sufficient butter be placed between
  layers so that each layer gets flaky, rather than having them stick
  together.  Pay particular attention to the edges and corners.
  
  *  In case you haven't noticed, this is very sweet stuff.  It goes great
  with a fine cup of coffee, espresso, or Turkish coffee, even with sugar.
  Two pieces will probably fill anyone up; it refrigerates and freezes quite
  well. This recipe requires a lot of effort, but it's well worth it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  1 1/2 hours preparation, 1 1/2 hours cooking, 2 hours cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: WAFFLE CONE
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 20 cones
 
      3    Eggs                                2 t  Vanilla
    3/4 C  Sugar, granulated               1 1/2 C  Flour
    1/2 C  Butter, melted                      2 t  Baking powder
 
  Beat the eggs and gradually beat in the sugar until the mixture is creamy.
  Stir in the melted butter and vanilla.
  
  Combine the flour and baking powder, and then add it to the mixture. Blend
  it in well.
  
  Drop about 4 t of the batter into a heated pizelle iron, and cook both
  sides over medium-high heat for about 1 minute each, or until golden brown.
  
  Remove the waffle from the pizelle iron and immediately shape it into a
  cone while it is still pliable.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Waffle ice-cream cone, pizelles -- This recipe comes from a recent issue
  of _Canadian Living_ magazine. Waffle cones look like round waffles shaped
  into a cone and have a wonderful taste. (I admit it, I'm hooked on them.)
  This recipe is actually for a type of cookie called the pizelle, but it
  tastes just like the waffle cones you can get at an ice-cream parlor.
  Yield:  about 20 cones.
  
  *  A pizelle iron looks like a round waffle iron.  There are "manual" irons
  and electric ones too.  If you don't have a pizelle iron, another idea is
  to use an ordinary waffle iron and have ice-cream on top of the waffle. Not
  having either a waffle iron or a pizelle iron, we tried making these on an
  electric griddle, but since the batter is fairly thick it wouldn't spread
  into a large enough circle to make cones from.
  
  *  When you form the cones, there will probably be a small hole in the
  bottom of them that ice-cream can drip out of. One idea for plugging this
  hole is to put miniature marshmallows in the bottoms of the cones.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1-2 minutes (per cone) cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: FAJITAS
 Categories: Meats, Tex-mex, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      3 lb Skirt steak                        16    Whole-wheat tortillas
      2 lg Yellow onions                       2 C  Cheese, grated
      2 T  Vegetable oil                       3 C  Guacamole

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 C  Lime juice                          2 T  Garlic, minced
      1 T  Black pepper, ground          

-------------------------------PICO DE GALLO-------------------------------
    1/2 C  Fresh cilantro, chopped             2 lg Tomatoes, chopped
      2    Scallions, chopped                  1 t  Garlic, minced
           -(green onions)                
 
  Combine marinade ingredients in a large glass baking dish.  Peel the fatty
  membrane from both sides of the skirt steak.  This requires a very sharp
  knife.  Add meat to marinade and marinate for at least 4 hours, preferably
  overnight.  Keep it in the refrigerator if you marinate overnight.
  
  MAKE THE PICO DE GALLO:  Combine all of the ingredients in a small serving
  bowl.
  
  Slice the yellow onions into 1/4-inch slices and cut each slice into a
  semi- circle. Grill the meat until it is cooked slightly less than the way
  you like it. Meanwhile, saute the onions in the oil until they are soft.
  Use a large frying pan that will have enough room for the meat later.
  
  After removing the meat from the grill, slice it into strips that are cut
  across the grain.  The strips should be about 3-4 inches long and about 1/4
  inch thick.  Add the strips to the onions in the pan and fry for another
  minute or two.
  
  Place on the table the pan full of meat, the bowl of pico de gallo, a
  basket with the tortillas, a bowl with the guacamole, and a bowl with the
  grated cheese. You may wish to provide picante sauce in addition.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Barbecued skirt steak marinated in lime:  a Tex-Mex favorite -- Fajitas
  originated in Texas as a way to make cheap meat palatable.  Unfortunately,
  it was too successful. It is still palatable, but because the word is out
  that fajitas are so delicious, the meat isn't cheap any more. Because this
  is not a traditional Mexican dish but a recent invention of Mexican
  immigrants, there is no fixed formula for it. Many different kinds of
  marinade are used; this one is adapted from a recipe given to a friend over
  the phone by Tortuga's in Austin, Texas.
  
  *  Each person makes her own fajita by taking a tortilla, spooning some of
  the meat onto it, then adding her choice of each of the other ingredients
  in whatever combination she wants.
  
  *  Skirt steak is somewhat like flank steak:  somewhat tough and with a
  very stringy texture. It is covered on both sides with a fatty membrane
  that must be removed or the meat will be very tough. The key to good
  fajitas is the proper removal of this membrane. Fresh-squeezed lime juice
  is best, but bottled will do. Some people from out of state choose to put
  sour cream on their fajitas.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes preparation, several hours marinating, 10 minutes
  cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHUTNEY IN THE RAW
 Categories: Condiments, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1 lb Dates (stoneless)                   1 t  Salt
      1 lb Apples                              1 t  Cayenne pepper
      1 lb Sultanas                            1 T  Pickling spices,
      1 lb Brown sugar                              -tied in a muslin bag
  2 1/2 C  Vinegar                               sm Ginger piece
 
  Mince the dates, apples and onions and place in a large pan.  Add the
  sultanas and stir in the sugar.
  
  Add all the other ingredients and stir well, but make sure the bag of
  spices and the ginger are identifiable. Leave for 24 hours but stir
  occasionally (once every 4 hours or so).
  
  Remove the bag of spices and ginger.  Bottle and store in a coolish place.
  Eat.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An easy chutney with no cooking -- This recipe filtered down to me
  through a grapevine of neighbours. You will need a supply of jam-jars,
  jam-jar covers and a large pan to keep the ingredients in. Yield: Makes
  several jars.
  
  *  I sometimes use currents in place of the stoneless dates, in which case
  you don't need to mince them. If the mixture appears too liquid after the
  24 hour standing time, it is worth draining off some of the vinegar before
  bottling.
  
  *  The beauty of this recipe is that you don't have a vast pot of strange
  things bubbling away on the stove for hours.  A big win!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  25 minutes preparation, 24 hours standing time.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK, but don't go overboard with the
  vinegar.

      Title: SPANISH CREAM
 Categories: Desserts, New zealand, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 1/2 C  Milk                                2    Eggs
           -(one Imperial pint)              1/2 t  Vanilla essence
      4 t  Gelatine                          1/3 C  Sugar
 
  Save a small amount of the milk; put the rest in a saucepan, together with
  the sugar and vanilla and heat.
  
  Separate the egg whites and save for later.  Beat the egg yolks with the
  remainder of the milk and add to the heating mixture.
  
  Stir to ensure the sugar is dissolved and bring to near boiling point to
  thoroughly cook the eggs.  Do not actually boil.  Take the saucepan off the
  heat.  Dissolve the gelatine in about 1/4 cup of boiling water and stir
  into hot custard. Pour into serving dish and put into refrigerator to cool.
  
  When mixture has cooled and almost set (it should be shivery at this point)
  thoroughly beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them in using a metal
  spoon.  Return mixture to refrigerator to properly set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Exquisite New Zealand custard dessert -- This dessert was a family
  favourite, and although we used to eat it in conjunction with some flavored
  jellies, it's delicious in its  own right.  The recipe comes from my
  mother, and I don't know what the Spanish part signifies.
  
  *  The texture of this dessert is supposed to be semi-fluffy.  If you fold
  in the egg whites too soon, the liquid custard won't support them and you
  end up with a two-layer result, solid custard on top, very light on the
  bottom. Some people may like this, but it's not the way I make it. On the
  other hand, if you leave things too long, it becomes difficult to fold in
  the egg whites at all.
  
  *  It's a good idea to whip the custard a little with a fork prior to
  folding in the whites. This breaks up the custard a little.
  
  *  Depending on sweetness of taste, you may wish to alter the amount of
  sugar. Our family had a sweet tooth, and I've reduced the original quantity
  as it is.
  
  *  One of the amazing things about this dessert is that it's so easy to
  make, and yet tastes so good.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes + setting.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SETTIN' 'ROUND BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 2 loaves
 
    1/4 C  Water                           1 1/2 t  Honey
           -(at 105 degrees)                 1/8 t  Cinnamon, ground
    1/3 C  Turbinado sugar                   1/2 C  Rolled oats
           -(most any sugar will             1/2 C  Cornmeal
           -do, though)                      1/4 C  Bran
      2 pk Yeast (dry), active               1/4 C  Cracked wheat
    1/4 C  Butter                            1/4 C  Buckwheat
    1/4 C  Shortening                        1/2 C  Soy flour
  1 1/2 C  Water                               1 C  Rye flour
    1/2 C  Milk                            2 1/2 C  Whole wheat flour
      1 lg Egg                                 3 C  White flour
      1 C  Dry milk, non-fat                        Butter
  1 1/2 t  Salt                           
 
  Melt the shortening and the butter.  Let them cool a bit, so as not to kill
  the yeast when they are added to the dough.  If you want to scald the milk,
  do so, and also let it cool (it is common practice to scald milk before
  baking with it, though I never do.)
  
  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the 1/4 cup of lukewarm water.
  
  Mix the cinnamon, oats, corn meal, bran, cracked wheat, buckwheat, soy
  flour and rye flour. Add the rest of the water, the milk, butter,
  shortening, egg and honey, and mix well. Stir in the dissolved yeast
  mixture.  Mix in the salt and the whole wheat flour.
  
  Stir in the white flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until the mixture is
  stiff enough to knead. You'll probably have about half of it left.
  
  Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, onto a floured surface.  Knead the
  dough, adding more white flour as necessary to keep the dough workable.
  Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about ten minutes. It's
  okay if you end up using less than or more than the three cups of white
  flour; just use whatever it takes.
  
  Put the dough back into a bowl that's been very lightly greased.  Let it
  rise, covered, in a still, warm place (around 85 degrees F. is best, though
  room temperature will work) for 45 minutes, or until it has doubled in
  bulk.
  
  Punch the dough down, divide in half, shape into loaves and place each half
  into a loaf pan which has been very lightly greased.  Let rise again, for
  another 45 minutes, in a still, warm place, until the loaves have about
  doubled in bulk.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. as the bread finishes rising.  Bake the
  bread for 35-40 minutes, until it sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove from
  the loaf pans and rub the top of the loaves with some butter to give them a
  nice, soft, chewy crust.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A 7-grain bread for toasting or eating plain -- This bread was first
  made from whatever was settin' 'round the kitchen when I started baking. It
  has a wonderful texture and flavor. Yield: 2 large loaves.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  about 3 hours (half of it rising time).

 Categories: Puddings, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      6 C  Bramble fruit (see note)                 Raw sugar
      1 lb Whole wheat bread                        Heavy cream
 
  In a two-quart pudding mold, crush but don't sieve the fruit.  Sweeten to
  taste with raw sugar (not brown sugar).
  
  Tear into small pieces enough homemade whole-wheat bread, crust and all, to
  pack the mold till it's full.  Refrigerate the pudding for something
  between 6 and 24 hours.
  
  Don't even dream of unmolding it, just spoon it out and serve it with heavy
  unsweetened cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Uncooked fruit and bread pudding -- Here is my friend Kate Ashcroft's
  Yorkshire version of the dessert known as "summer pudding".
  
  *  For "bramble fruit" use some berry that grows on a brambly vine.
  Raspberries, blackberries, presumably huckleberries and ollalie berries.
  Some currants are OK, some gooseberries are OK, even some blueberries are
  OK, but no strawberries, they don't fit the mood.
  
  *  Day-old bread is better than dead fresh for this recipe, but not older
  than a day.
  
  *  For contrast, here is the standard version:  In a two-quart pudding
  mold, truck out one pint of Woolworth's raspberry jam with enough Golden
  Syrup to make a quart and a half of goo. Tear into small pieces enough
  stale crumb, not crust, of bakery white bread to pack the mold till it's
  full. Refrigerate the pudding for six weeks. Serve with Bird's Custard
  Sauce.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 6 hours cooling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: STUFFED SHRIMP WITH BACON
 Categories: Appetizers, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
     12 lg Shrimp (the                              -(low-moisture)
           -larger the better)                 1 lb Bacon (as little
      1 lb Mozzarella                               -fat as possible)
 
  Steam shrimp lightly, just about 30-60 seconds after they begin to turn
  orange.  Plunge shrimp into ice water to cool.  Do this immediately.  Peel
  and butterfly the shrimp.
  
  Cut the mozzarella into strips that are a little smaller than the shrimp.
  Put mozzarella in shrimp and (this is important) roll shrimp from tail to
  head while it is open (butterflied). This keeps the cheese from leaking.
  
  Wrap shrimp-cheese roll in 1/2 slice of bacon and put on skewer.  Cook on
  grill or barbecue, over moderate heat, until bacon looks done.
  
  When shrimp are butterflied, cut them almost all the way through so they
  can lay flat when open. This makes them easier to roll. The fire will flare
  up due to bacon fat. Turn the skewers often to cook evenly. The bacon
  should be slightly charred when done. The reason why the shrimp are cooked
  lightly first is that they tend to cook slower than the bacon.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A high-cholesterol appetizer with shrimp, cheese and bacon.  Yield:
  Serves 2-4.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: VAGUELY-THAI SCALLOPS
 Categories: Seafood, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Scallops, preferably                3 T  Nam Pla (Thai
           -the large (sea) kind,                   -fish sauce)
           -but small bay scallops             3    Garlic cloves, chopped
           -should be ok                       2 T  Fresh ginger, chopped
    1/2 lb Snow peas                           4 T  Butter
    1/2 C  White wine                               Pepper, freshly ground
      1 T  Lime juice                  
 
  Start some rice cooking, so it will be done when the scallops are done.  If
  you're using large (sea) scallops, slice them into strips about 1/4 inch
  thick.  If you're using small (bay) scallops, don't bother slicing them.
  
  Rinse and drain the snow peas and remove the strings.  Cut the pods into
  1-inch lengths.
  
  Heat a small saucepan or skillet, then put in a little butter.  Add the
  ginger and saute for 30 seconds, then add the garlic and saute for another
  30 seconds.
  
  Add the wine and fish sauce, and reduce the mixture by half, stirring
  often. Keep this hot during the next few steps, but stir it so that it
  doesn't burn.
  
  Heat a skillet large enough to hold the scallops in one layer, and melt the
  rest of the butter.  Over moderately high heat, add the scallops and pepper
  to taste. Add the snow peas and stir-fry until the peas have change color
  and the scallops have turned opaque, about 2 minutes. Don't overcook the
  scallops, just cook them until they've lost their translucent look.
  
  Add the sauce and lime juice to the skillet and stir everything for a few
  seconds, until well-mixed.  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sauteed scallops with snow peas in fish sauce -- This is something I
  invented with what I had around after I bought some scallops on impulse.
  It's inspired partly by a recipe of Madeline Kamman's and partly by Thai
  and Chinese recipes, although scallop recipes are rare in my Asian
  cookbooks. It's not spicy and probably has very little to do with real Thai
  cooking, but the taste of Nam Pla (Thai fish sauce) is an interesting
  complement to the scallops. Serve it with rice.
  
  *  Nam Pla is available in asian markets or some supermarkets.  Substitute
  soy sauce if you cannot find it. Do not add salt; the Nam Pla is salty
  enough.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Experiment with the proportions.

      Title: CREAMED SPINACH
 Categories: Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     20 oz Spinach, chopped                    2 T  Horseradish, prepared
           -(fresh or frozen)                       -(or less)
      1 C  Sour cream (or less)           
 
  Clean, trim and chop spinach, and cook in a dry, covered saucepan over a
  medium heat until the spinach is wilted.  If you are using frozen spinach,
  cook to thaw and evaporate all water, then proceed.  Stir in sour cream and
  horseradish.  Serve hot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Creamed spinach with sour cream -- This is a recipe for a version of
  creamed spinach that we found that uses sour cream instead of milk.  We
  have tried it and it is quite good.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes.

      Title: INVISIBLE OATMEAL COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 4 dozen
 
      1 C  Flour                           1 1/2 C  Oats, quick-cooking
      2 t  Baking powder                            -(uncooked)
    1/2 t  Salt                                2 lg Eggs (lightly beaten)
      1 t  Cinnamon, ground                    1 t  Vanilla extract
    1/4 t  Nutmeg, ground                      1 t  Almond extract
    1/2 C  Butter (softened                    1 C  Raisins
           -to room temperature)               1 C  Dates (chopped)
      1 C  Brown sugar (packed                 1 C  Pecans (chopped)
           -firmly into measuring cup)    
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Sift together flour, baking powder, salt,
  cinnamon and nutmeg until well blended.
  
  In a separate bowl, stir softened butter with brown sugar until well mixed.
  
  Stir sifted dry ingredients into butter-sugar mixture.  Stir in dry oats
  and beaten eggs. Add vanilla and almond extracts. Mix thoroughly. Stir in
  raisins, chopped dates and chopped pecans.  Mix well until batter is firm.

  onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 18 minutes in 350 degree F. oven
  until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheet, lay flat, and cool for 10
  minutes before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Delicious high-fiber oatmeal drop cookies -- These oatmeal cookies are
  for cookie lovers to splurge with. Not only are they great tasting, but
  they are very high in fiber content and easy to make. The recipe is mine
  and is based on several different ideas in different cookbooks as how to
  best to make them. In fun, I call them "Invisible Oatmeal Cookies" because
  they are wont to disappear whenever unguarded. Enjoy.
  
  *  If any children (young or old) live within smelling distance of your
  stove, make extra cookies for when they suddenly show up for an unexpected
  visit.
  
  *  The recipe may be halved, doubled, or whatever without harm.  The batter
  as well as the baked cookies freeze well. Thaw batter on countertop. Thaw
  cookies either in microwave or in oven.

  Trim all but a thin layer of far from the lamb, and make small slits over
  the surface of the meat. Insert the slivered garlic into these slits. Brush
  the lamb with lemon juice, and rub rosemary, salt and pepper into the meat.
  
  Place the lamb, fat side up, on a roasting rack in a large, shallow
  roasting pan. Roast at 350 degrees F. for 1 1/2 hours, or until a
  properly-placed meat thermometer reads 140 degrees F. for rare, 150 for
  medium, or 160 for well- done. Carve and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Leg of lamb with rosemary and lemon; this is a leg of lamb recipe based
  on one published in _Family Circle_ magazine in June of 1983.
  
  *  The drippings from the lamb may be combined with flour, all-purpose and
  broth to make gravy.

      Title: MINT WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
 Categories: Mousse, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 oz Chocolate, white                    2    Egg whites
      3 T  Creme de menthe, green                   -(at room temperature)
      1 C  Cream, heavy                     
 
  Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler.  When melted, stir in the
  creme de menthe. Let it cool a bit and stir in about 2 1/2 T of cream. Let
  cool.
  
  Beat the egg whites until stiff, but not dry.  Fold the
  chocolate-creme-cream mixture into the beaten egg whites. THE MORE
  CAREFULLY YOU FOLD, THE LIGHTER WILL BE THE MOUSSE.
  
  Whip the remaining cream, until soft peaks form.  Fold the egg
  whites-chocolate mixture into the whipped cream.  AGAIN, THE MORE AIR YOU
  PRESERVE, THE LIGHTER THE MOUSSE.  Spoon carefully into small bowls or cups
  and chill for about two hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sinful and light mint chocolate mousse -- This concoction is a variation
  of another white chocolate mousse, which is a variation of a dark rum
  chocolate mousse. It was invented for a friend's birthday, which happens to
  be on St. Patrick's Day. We were sitting around the day before, planning
  the celebration, and I offered to bring some white mousse. Someone
  suggested it should be green, in honor of the occasion. I came up with the
  perfect way to make green chocolate mousse....

      Title: VEGETARIAN LASAGNA
 Categories: Pasta, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
----------------------------------LASAGNA----------------------------------
      1 md Onion, chopped                           -coarsely chopped
    1/2 lb Carrots, grated                     8 oz Lasagna noodles
      1 lb Spinach                                  -(1/2 packet)
      5 oz Sweet corn,                         2    Garlic cloves
           -drained (1/2 tin)                1/4 lb Cheese, grated
    1/4 lb Mushrooms,                    

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
  2 1/2 C  Milk                                2 oz Butter
      2 oz Cornflour (cornstarch)         
 
  Gently fry the carrots and garlic in some butter, set aside.  Gently fry
  the onions and mushrooms in some butter, set aside.
  
  Wash the spinach and cook gently in a saucepan without adding any water.
  Stir frequently. This really does work and it stops it from going slimy.
  Add the corn to this and set aside.
  
  Now make the white sauce.  Melt the butter in a saucepan, take it off the
  heat, add the cornflour.  Mix this well.  Slowly add the milk, stirring all
  the time.  It is important not to stop stirring, even for a moment. Return
  it to the heat and keep stirring until it thickens.
  
  Now build your lasagna.  Take a large square ovenproof dish at least 2
  inches deep (we use one about 8 x 12 inches for the quantities given) and
  assemble in layers starting with a layer of lasagna, then a layer of sauce,
  then one of the previously-prepared vegetable pairs. Repeat the lasagna,
  sauce, vegetable pair combination twice more. At this point you should, if
  all has gone well, run out of vegetables. Finish off with lasagna and then
  sauce.
  
  Top with the cheese and sprinkle on a little paprika if you want.
  
  Bake for about 35 mins at 350 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A vegetable lasagna with spinach, mushrooms and corn -- This vegetarian
  dish can be served on its own or with a side salad.  My thanks to Erica and
  Milica who gave me this recipe and who tried different vegetable
  combinations until the corn stopped falling out of the sides. Experiment
  for yourself, substitute different vegetables according to the season and
  your preference. Yield: Serves four to six people.
  
  *  The servings should stay whole as you serve them.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, but remember to stir the sauce.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 35 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  Put in a covered dish and keep warm in the oven while you make the rice to
  serve it over.  This makes it easy to make the rice, and the pork actually
  browns a little more during this time.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pork with lime and hot peppers -- This recipe was originally based on
  one I found in a paperback cookbook. Over the years I have adapted it into
  what you see here. It is fairly hot, but always gets rave reviews from
  everyone, even from people who normally don't like hot food. Yield: Serves
  6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.

      Title: CHEESECAKE (Belgian)
 Categories: Cheesecakes, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
      2 C  Rolled oats (do not               2/3 C  Brown sugar
           -use instant oatmeal              1/2 C  Butter, unsalted
           -or steel-cut oats)                      -(at room temperature)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
     11 oz Cream cheese                      3/4 C  Cottage cheese,
           -(at room temperature)                   -small-curd
      3    Eggs                                1 t  Vanilla extract
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix crust ingredients with your hands until
  well blended.  Put the mixture in a 9-inch springform pan and form a crust,
  pushing it about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the pan.  Bake the crust
  about 10 minutes at 350 degrees F. and let it cool.
  
  Beat (or mix) the filling ingredients, at very high speed, for seven
  minutes. The mixture must be very smooth. Put the filling in the baked
  crust.  You may want to re-form the crust slightly first.
  
  Bake for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees F.  The cheesecake is done when the
  filling is firm, but not dark (burned) on top.  Let it cool, then chill it.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A moist cheesecake with a wonderful crust -- A college friend gave me
  this recipe, oh so many moons ago. It comes from his parents, and may have
  roots in Belgium. It is very different from the typical New-York-style dry
  cheesecake.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: SUPERIOR WHIPPING CREAM
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 2 cups
 
    1/2 C  Whipping cream                           -and about 1/2 t
      2 t  Vanilla sugar                            -vanilla extract)
           -(or use white sugar           
 
  Shake the carton of whipping cream well and pour it into the blender or
  food processor. Add the vanilla sugar (see below if you don't know what
  vanilla sugar is.)
  
  Whip the cream in the machine.  If it's a food processor, leave the pushing
  device out; if a blender, remove the center of the lid, or just cover the
  top of the jar with your hand. The trick is to allow lots of air into the
  cream. Run the machine for no more than five seconds at a time, to avoid
  making butter. The cream is done when it holds a peak.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple way to make whipped cream extra yummy -- There is almost no
  dessert that can't be improved by adding a dollop of whipping cream.
  Unfortunately, most people seem to be  afraid of actually whipping the
  cream, so they buy the awful stuff that comes in a pressurized can, or
  spend money on expensive devices to inject gas into the cream. (Or worse,
  they use Cool Whip.) The truth is that making your own whipped cream is
  trivial, with the appropriate mechanical aids. Yield: makes about 2 cups.
  
  *  If you don't know what vanilla sugar is, don't panic.  My mother makes
  this variation in a separate sugar container; fill the container with
  sugar, add a vanilla bean and wait. After a week or two, the sugar will
  take on the vanilla flavor. Use this sugar whenever a recipe calls for
  sugar and vanilla extract; just remember to keep the container full.
  
  *  If you don't have vanilla sugar around, use regular sugar and vanilla
  extract for the cream.

      Title: MOM'S MEATLOAF
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 C  Bread crumbs                        2    Eggs (slightly beaten)
    3/4 C  Onion, minced                       2 T  Horseradish
    1/4 t  Garlic powder                       1 pn Salt
      2 lb Meat, ground                      1/4 C  Milk or water
           -(I often use                       1 T  Mustard, dry
           -a combination of                 3/4 C  Catsup
           -beef and lamb)              
 
  Combine all ingredients except for about 1/2 cup of the catsup.  Place into
  a loaf pan, or shape into a loaf on a baking sheet. Spread the reserved
  catsup on top of the loaf. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 40 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A nice, simple meatloaf -- This is the meatloaf my mother makes.  Where
  she got the recipe, who knows? Probably from her mother.... I think it's
  the best meatloaf in the world (and I'm sure you think your meatloaf is the
  best!).  Yield:  Serves 6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking and cooling.

      Title: TAGLIATELLE
 Categories: Pasta, Usenet
      Yield: 3 servings
 
     15 oz Tagliatelle                         6 T  Double cream
      3 oz Butter                              4 oz Bacon (chopped)
      2    Egg yolks                                Salt
      2 T  Parmesan, grated                         Pepper, freshly-milled
 
  Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, add some salt and a few drops
  of oil and cook the tagliatelle for 8 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, melt about 1 oz of butter in a small pan and cook the chopped
  bacon for 3-4 minutes.
  
  Beat the egg yolks together with the remainder of the butter, the Parmesan
  cheese, the cream and some freshly-milled black pepper. Drain the
  tagliatelle and put it back in the pan quickly so as not to lose heat.
  
  Add the bacon and its juices to the pasta, pour in the egg and cream
  mixture and toss well. (If you've done this quickly enough, the heat from
  the pasta will cook the egg yolks to a creamy sauce). Season with salt and
  pepper if desired, then serve with more Parmesan.
  
  Serve accompanied with green vegetables such as courgettes (zucchini) or
  leeks, or with a green salad.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Tagliatelle with bacon and cream -- A quick yet rich recipe, originally
  published in the recipe column in _BBC Radio Times_ magazine.
  
  *  For aesthetic reasons, green tagliatelle looks best when served.
  
  *  "Double cream" is a product not normally available in North America.  It
  has 40 percent butterfat; "whipping cream" has 30 percent butterfat.  If
  you make this recipe with whipping cream instead of double cream, then use
  about 1 T more butter.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (timing is critical).
  : Time:  15 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: SEAFOOD PITA
 Categories: Sandwiches, Seafood, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
    1/2 lb Scallops or Shrimp              1 1/2 C  Vegetable (such as
    1/4 C  Olive oil                                -eggplant or zucchini)
      1 md Onion                                    Salt, pepper and
      1    Garlic cloves                            -spices (to taste)
           -(more or less to taste)        1 1/2 C  Couscous, cooked
    3/4 C  Mushrooms                                Pita bread
 
  Cut up the vegetables into small (about 1/2 inch) cubes.  Slice the
  mushrooms.
  
  If using shrimp, peel and de-vein the shrimp and cut into small cubes.
  
  In a small amount of olive oil, saute the onion and the optional garlic
  until the onion is soft but not quite transparent.
  
  Heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet and add the vegetable and
  mushrooms. Saute until the vegetables are almost soft. Taste and add salt,
  pepper and whatever spices strike your fancy (oregano, basil and red pepper
  are good). Add the scallops or shrimp and cook until just done, about a
  minute or two. Scallops will turn opaque and shrimp will turn pink. Do NOT
  overcook.
  
  There should be an excess of oil and fluid.  If not, add more oil and
  briefly heat. Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Add the couscous and mix
  thoroughly. Chill several hours or overnight.
  
  Stuff into the pita bread (maybe with some tomato) and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pita-Seafood Salad Sandwiches -- This recipe is more of a formula than a
  recipe.  It is excellent for a cool dinner in the summer (any time after
  February in Texas!)  Yield:  Serves 2-4.
  
  *  You could substitute almost any vegetable and crab or a firm fish.  To
  use this for a picnic, don't stuff the pita bread until you are about to
  serve it. Err on the side of too much oil, since the couscous absorbs the
  oil (and a recent study says that olive oil may be good for you).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chilling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Onions                              2 oz Butter
      4 C  Beef stock                               Salt, pepper
 
  Peel and slice the onions thinly.  Fry the onions in the butter until
  golden brown. This will take about 30 minutes. Add the stock and simmer for
  30 minutes. Season and serve.
  
  The amount of onions can be varied down to about half the amount given
  above. Onion soup in no way makes me a cannibal.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Easy onion soup -- This recipe came from some ancient recipe cards we
  have. It makes a great starter and is almost trivially easy to prepare.

  Put all the ingredients in a pot.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and cover.
  Cook for about 45 minutes or until beans are tender.  Stir occasionally;
  you will also need to add water during this 45 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple soup with lentils, tomatoes and hot pepper -- This is a spicy
  vegetarian lentil soup.  It makes a very good main course or side dish. You
  don't have to soak the lentils ahead of time!
  
  *  The spicing can be varied to taste.

      Title: SENATE BEAN SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Navy beans, dried                 1/4 C  Parsley (fresh),
      1    Ham bone (get one                        -chopped fine
           -with plenty of                     1 C  Potatoes, mashed
           -meat on it)                        1 t  Salt (or less
     12 C  Water                                    -to taste)
      3 md Onions, chopped fine              1/4 t  Pepper
      3    Garlic cloves, minced             1/4 C  Chives (fresh),
      3    Celery stalks,                           -chopped
           -chopped fine                  
 
  Wash the beans and remove those that float in the wash water.  Soak beans
  overnight in enough water to cover them by several inches.  Drain.
  
  In a large kettle, place 3 quarts of cold water.  Add the drained beans and
  the ham bone and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, partially
  covered, for 2 hours. If scum forms on the surface, skim it off.
  
  Chop the onions, garlic, celery and parsley.  Add to the pot.  Add the
  mashed potato to the pot. Simmer 1 more hour. Check the beans. If they are
  not yet tender, then simmer some more.
  
  Add salt and pepper.  Remove the ham bone and pull the meat from it.  Cut
  the meat into small chunks and toss them back into the soup. Serve piping
  hot into preheated bowls and sprinkle chopped fresh chives atop each.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Bean soup as served in the U.S.  Senate dining room -- I lived in
  suburban Washington, DC, for most of my formative years. One of the things
  that formed in the aforementioned years was a strong impression that the
  government was full of beans. One day on a school visit to my senator I
  learned just how it was that the government got to be so full of beans, and
  I came away with the recipe. This is one of the best soups I have ever
  tasted.  Serve it with a big loaf of fresh hot homemade whole-wheat bread,
  from which people just tear the bread with their fingers.
  
  *  The House of Representatives serves a version without the onions and
  garlic and mashed potatoes.
  
  *  Great Northern beans are an adequate substitute for Navy beans.  If you
  forgot to soak them overnight and still want to make the soup, you can
  simmer them for an hour and then discard that water. The beans end up with
  slightly more flavor if you cold-soak them.
  
  *  You can almost certainly get away with using instant mashed potato
  flakes to acquire the 1 cup of mashed potatoes that this recipe calls for.

      Title: FRUIT SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Fruit, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     12 oz Apple juice                              Nutmeg
           -concentrate (one can)              2 C  Yogurt, unflavored
      2    Peaches or nectarines                    Honey
      1    Cantaloupe wedge                         Sherry (or other
      2    Apricots                                 - sweet wine)
     12    Strawberries                       12 oz Grape juice
      1 sm Lemon                                    - concentrate (one can)
      1 sm Lime                                4    Violets or other
    1/2 t  Mint (dried flakes)                      - small non-toxic flowers
           Cinnamon                       
 
  Wash and peel the peaches, cantaloupe and apricots.  Wash and hull the
  strawberries and set aside the 4 nicest ones.  Peaches and apricots peel
  more easily if you dip them in boiling water for a few seconds before
  peeling. Try not to lose any juice from the fruit.
  
  Put half of the fruit into the bowl of a food processor and puree.  You
  could also use a food mill for this. Put the pureed fruit into a bowl and
  add the apple juice concentrate, an equal quantity of water, the juice of
  the lemon and of the lime, the mint flakes, a sprinkle each of cinnamon and
  nutmeg, and half of the yogurt. Whisk together well. Add several glugs of
  sherry and honey to taste. (It shouldn't be very sweet, a couple spoonfuls
  should do it.)
  
  Put the rest of the fruit in the food processor and pulse until well
  chopped but with recognizable chunks of fruit still visible. Put this into
  a different bowl and mix some of the first mixture into it so the fruit
  doesn't turn brown. Put both bowls in the refrigerator for at least half an
  hour.
  
  When you're ready to serve, divide the chunky fruit into 4 soup bowls. Fill
  each bowl almost to the rim with the soup.  Pour the grape juice
  concentrate into a creamer or small pitcher and carefully pour two
  concentric circles of grape juice into each bowl. Take a chopstick or
  similar sized utensil and draw it through each bowl several times
  alternating from the center to the edge and from the edge to the center,
  lifting the chopstick after each stroke. This should turn the rings of
  grape juice into sort of a zigzag pattern. Stir up the remaining yogurt
  well and put a little mound of yogurt into each bowl. (The yogurt will
  probably sink.  Put more in until you get a mound!)  Slice the 4 reserved
  strawberries thinly and surround each mound of yogurt with strawberry
  slices.  Top each mound of yogurt with a flower and get ready for the oohs
  and ahs.
  
  You can substitute any fruit that you want, but use strong tasting fruits
  like pineapple in moderation or they will take over the soup. Bananas are
  nice; cherries are wonderful but impossible to peel. Plums and other fruits
  with very mild flavors tend to get lost in the shuffle. The juice
  concentrates can be replaced with regular juices; vary them if you like,
  also.  There's an apple-pear-grape juice combination that's delicious as
  the base and cranberry juice is nice as the contrasting color. Or, use a
  darker juice for the base and something lighter in color like orange juice
  to make the rings. Cherries or mint leaves make attractive garnishes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fresh fruit soup -- This is a simple, delicious soup, perfect for a hot
  summer day.  It is based upon a recipe in "The Moosewood Cookbook" by
  Mollie Katzen. This describes what emerged last time I made it; vary any or
  all of the ingredients freely. I've included some suggestions at the end.
  
  *  Of course you don't have to go through all the special presentation
  work, but it really doesn't take that much time and it makes the result
  into something special. Doing the fruit in two steps is strictly optional;
  if you're not going to make the ring pattern you may as well just process
  it all at once and stop before it's completely pureed.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 30 minutes chilling, 10 minutes
  presentation.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  NOTES:
  
  *  World champion Texas red chili -- This recipe comes from Bill Pfeiffer.
   He won the 1980 and 1982 World Chili Cookoff and took first place in the
  International Chili Society's 14th annual World Championship Chili Cookoff
  with it.
  
  Pfeiffer calls this recipe "Capitol Punishment Chili" because he won his
  first attempt at a chili cookoff in Washington, DC. Texas red chili has no
  beans...
  
  *  Probably your favorite brand of beer is ok.  Pfeiffer's ICS winning
  recipe uses Budweiser because they sponsored the contest. For hotter chili,
  add additional Louisiana Red Hot sauce to taste.
  
  *  This chili is a great dish if you have a LOT of time.  Note well the
  amount of time called for in each simmering step.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  4-5 hours.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: NEW MEXICO ENCHILADAS
 Categories: Entrees, Southwest, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Beef, ground                        4 oz Tomato sauce
      2    Garlic cloves, minced               8 oz Water
           -(or less)                          2    Corn tortillas
      1 t  Salt (more or less                  2    Eggs
           -to taste)                               Vegetable oil
           Pepper                              1 C  Lettuce, shredded
      3 t  Chili powder (or less,              1 lg Tomato, chopped
           -to taste)                          1 md Onion, chopped
      1 T  Flour                               5 oz Cheddar cheese, grated
 
  Saute the beef over medium heat until it has lost its raw red color,
  chopping it with the edge of a spoon into small pieces as it cooks. Add the
  garlic and spices and cook another 3-4 minutes. Add salt, pepper and chili
  powder to taste. Remember that the flavor of chili mellows as it cooks,
  although it won't get less hot. Add the flour to the meat mixture and stir
  well.  Add the tomato sauce and water. Simmer gently (uncovered) for about
  45 minutes, until it has thickened and the flavors are blended.
  
  Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat, until
  it sizzles when a bit of tortilla is dropped in. Soften the tortillas
  briefly in the oil, one at a time, about 5 seconds on a side. (Turn with
  tongs, being careful not to tear them.) Drain on paper towels. Prepare
  another small skillet with a small amount of oil in the bottom, enough for
  frying an egg.
  
  Assembling the enchiladas requires you to keep track of several things at
  once.  Start an egg frying for each enchilada.  Make sure that the yolk is
  cooked soft, not hard! Put one tortilla on a dinner plate.  Cover it with a
  medium-thick layer of meat sauce.  Sprinkle chopped onion and grated cheese
  on top. Sprinkle lettuce and chopped tomato around the edge. Top with
  another tortilla. Cover with more meat sauce, sprinkle more onion and
  cheese.  Now top with the fried egg and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  New-Mexico-style enchiladas with eggs -- This is the way my grandmother
  and aunt made enchiladas; I haven't lived in New Mexico myself, but that's
  where this recipe came from. Yield: Serves 2.
  
  *  You can also make single-decker enchiladas, for people with small
  appetites.  Omit the second layer of tortilla, meat, onion and cheese, but
  don't forget the egg.  If you make single-deckers, you will need twice as
  many tortillas and twice as many eggs, but the same amount of the other
  ingredients.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes simmering, 5 minutes assembly.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: QUICK CHICKEN MOLE
 Categories: Microwave, Sauces, Chicken, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 md Onion, chopped                      1 T  Sugar
           -(or 1/2 large onion)               4 T  Chile, ground
      1    Garlic clove, minced                     -(approximately; see note)
      2 T  Butter                              2 T  Sesame seeds
      1    Bay leaf                          1/2 C  Almonds (blanched),
      6    Peppercorns                              -slivered
      3    Cloves (whole), crushed         1 1/2 oz Mexican chocolate,
      8 oz Tomato sauce                             -grated (a half circle
      1 C  Chicken broth                            -in the usual packaging)
      1 sl Bread, shredded                     1    Chicken, cut up
    1/4 t  Anise seeds, crushed                     -(about 3 pounds)
    1/2 t  Cinnamon                       
 
  Put the onion, garlic and margarine in a large (3-quart) microwaveable,
  covered casserole.  Cover and microwave on half power for 2-3 minutes, or
  until butter is melted and the onion is starting to soften.
  
  Mix in the rest of the ingredients except the chocolate and the chicken.
  Cover and microwave on high for 10 minutes, stirring after half the time.
  When the sauce is done, stir in the chocolate until it's melted.
  
  Add the chicken, coating each piece with sauce.  Microwave covered, on high
  power for about 30 minutes.  Rearrange the pieces twice during cooking so
  it cooks evenly. The chicken is done when it starts to fall away from the
  bone.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A microwave version of Mole Poblano -- Mole Poblano (pronounced MOE-lay
  puh-BLAH-no) is the kind of Mexican cooking one doesn't often find in
  restaurants outside of Mexico.  It consists of chicken in a dark, spicy
  sauce full of nuts and sesame seeds. All of the traditional mole recipes
  I've seen require several hours of preparation and cooking time, so I
  developed this version for those of us who have only limited time for
  cooking.  It takes about an hour to put together.
  
  *  My microwave puts out 650 watts on high power and has a turntable in it.
  You'll probably have to stir things more often if yours doesn't have a
  turntable.  If your microwave is rated at less than 600 watts, it's
  probably too small to fit the chicken in anyway.
  
  *  Use pure ground chile, not chile powder (which usually contains other
  ingredients).  The stuff I use comes in little plastic bags, and they keep
  it in the Mexican food section of the store instead of the spice section.
  The hotness of the chile can vary considerably, so the most reliable
  procedure is to mix in a little at a time, tasting the sauce as you go
  along.  Mole is supposed to be spicy, not scorchingly hot; a blend of mild
  chiles gives the best flavor. I usually use about 2 T mild Pasilla chile
  and another about 2 tablespoons medium-hot California chile.
  
  *  Mexican chocolate comes in round tablets about 3 inches in diameter.  If
  you can't find any in the grocery store, use a piece of a dark chocolate
  candy bar (or semi-sweet chocolate chips) instead, and add an additional
  1/2 t cinnamon.
  
  *  You can substitute pine nuts, toasted pumpkin seeds, or raisins for all
  or part of the almonds.
  
  *  In theory, you can cook this on top of the stove in a Dutch oven in the
  traditional style, although I've never tried it myself.  Judging by the
  recipes I've seen, you should simmer the chicken in water for about an hour
  first, then make the sauce and cook the chicken in the sauce for another
  half hour.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: PUMPKIN SCONES
 Categories: Breads, Australian, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 T  Butter                              1 C  Pumpkin, cooked
    1/2 C  Sugar                                    -(cold), mashed
      1    Egg                               1/8 t  Salt
      2 C  Flour, self-raising                
 
  Grease a scone tray or baking tray.  Cream together the butter and sugar
  until light and fluffy. Add egg and beat well.
  
  Add pumpkin, flour and salt and fold in by hand.  Knead lightly and cut
  into 1-inch squares. Place close together on the scone tray and bake at 425
  degrees F. until well risen and golden on top (about 15 minutes).  Serve
  hot, with butter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pumpkin scones -- Scones (pronounced with a short `o', rhymes with
  `Fonz') are a popular accompaniment to afternoon tea. They are often served
  with jam and whipped cream. In this variation the scones are flavoured with
  pumpkin. It is not a typical scone recipe.
  
  Pumpkin scones can be eaten in place of bread with a meal.  This recipe was
  made famous by the wife of the Premier of Queensland.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  To an Australian, a pumpkin is a large round, squat, green or blue-green
  vegetable that is orange on the inside.  There are many varieties, all of
  species Cucurbita maxima.  In North America a good substitute is acorn
  squash (Cucurbita pepo); elsewhere a butternut squash (Caryoka nuciferum)
  would be a fair substitute.

           Angelica (Cut two pieces            2    Pear halves, preferably
           -of crystalized (candied)                -canned (for

  Carefully halve the almonds along the natural split in the nut.  (This is
  easiest after they are still wet from blanching.)  Place the pear halves,
  round side up, in the serving dish.
  
  At the narrow end of each half, add two almond halves to make mouse ears.
  At the other end, insert the angelica to make a tail.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick pear dessert -- In general, a typical Australian dish is a
  typical British dish, which is to say a typical European or American dish
  with most of the subtleties of flavour (and difficulty in making) removed.
  The following dessert is a genuine Old Family Favorite in Australia.
  
  *  Candied angelica is almost impossible to find in North America. Anything
  else with the appropriate properties of sweetness and shape may be
  substituted, e.g.  a piece of chocolate or candy cut to size, such as an
  Ovation mint divided longitudinally.

      Title: PAVLOVA I
 Categories: Desserts, Australian, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4    Egg whites                          1 T  Vinegar
           -(at room temperature)                   Cornflour
      1 C  Sugar, castor                  
 
  With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form,  then
  gradually add the sugar (about 1 t every 30 seconds).  This will take
  around 15 minutes. Beat until firm. Add the vinegar. When combined, turn
  out onto a flat baking sheet that has been greased and dusted with
  cornflour. Shape it so that there will be a hollow in the centre to hold
  the fruit.
  
  Cook in a pre-heated, warm oven (350-375 degrees F.) for 10 minutes, then
  at 200-250 degrees F. for 40-50 mins.
  
  When cooked, turn the oven off and allow to cool slowly in the oven for at
  least an hour, preferably overnight.  Gradual cooling is important.  Serve
  cold, topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit such as strawberries,
  bananas and kiwi fruit.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pavlova (Australian meringue dessert) -- This is a quintessentially
  Australian dish.  The legend behind it is that it was created by a chef in
  Adelaide after he had seen Anna Pavlova dance, saying that he wanted to
  create a dessert that was as light and airy as her dancing.
  
  Australians pride themselves on their ability to cook a good Pavlova.  When
  important visitors come to an Australian household, they are likely to be
  served a Pavlova with plenty of fresh fruit.  There are many variations on
  the recipe. This one comes from my friend Janet Wiles. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  Castor sugar is known in North America as "granulated sugar." Cornflour
  is likewise "cornstarch." The higher temperature initially is to form a
  crust on the outside of the meringue base, it should be crisp on the
  outside, though not browned, and soft inside. It's important that the
  beaters and the bowl are really dry and clean. Uneven temperatures will
  cause the base to collapse (keep the oven door closed and let it cool
  slowly).  Experienced Pavlova cooks claim that electric ovens work best
  because they heat more uniformly.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 or more hours cooling.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

      Title: PAVLOVA II
 Categories: Desserts, Australian, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 lg Egg whites                          1 t  Vinegar
      1 C  Sugar, castor                       1 t  Vanilla flavour
      1 t  Cornflour                      
 
  Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.  With an electric mixer beat the egg whites
  until soft peaks form,  then gradually add the sugar.  Beat until firm.
  
  Add the cornflour, vinegar and vanilla.  When combined, turn out onto a
  flat tray that has been greased and dusted with cornflour. Try a circular
  shape with slightly more mixture at the edges so that it may be served by
  placing goodies in its centre depression.
  
  Cook in a pre-heated, cool (250 degrees F.) oven for one hour.  When
  cooked, turn the oven off, leave the oven door slightly ajar, and allow to
  cool slowly in the oven. This slow cooling works to prevent the loss of too
  much height. Serve cold, with whipped cream and fresh fruit pieces,
  strawberries and kiwi fruit for example.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Australian meringue dessert.
  
  *  Cornflour is known in North America as cornstarch.  Castor sugar is
  known there as granulated sugar.
  
  *  Make sure that you start off with a clean bowl and beat the egg whites
  well.  A bowl with smooth sides (glass, metal) will help the eggs to whip
  up. A plastic bowl with scratches prevents the eggs from attaining a very
  light texture. Also ensure that the sugar is fully dissolved before going
  on to the next step. I have never had troubles from over-whipping. The
  final texture should be meringue on the inside with a thin crust on the
  outside.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

      Title: RUTH COCHRAN'S CORN CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      3 T  Butter                            1/2 C  Water
      1 sm Onion, chopped                           Salt and pepper
      1 C  Ham, cubed                         16 oz Canned corn
      3 md Potatoes,                                -(cream-style or regular)
           -peeled and cubed                   2 C  Milk
 
  Melt butter and saute onions until soft and transparent.  Add the ham,
  potatoes, water, salt and pepper (to taste) and cook, covered, until the
  potatoes are done (easily pierced with a fork).  Add the corn and the milk
  and heat thoroughly. Do NOT boil. Serve with fresh bread.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A hearty corn soup -- This recipe comes from my mother-in-law and is a
  family favorite.  It makes a good, hearty meal when served with fresh bread
  or rolls. Yield: Serves 2-4 people.
  
  *  If you don't have any ham, you can substitute 6 slices of bacon.  Fry up
  the bacon and remove from the pan.  Saute the onions in the bacon fat and
  continue from there.  Crumble the bacon and add with the milk and corn
  instead of with the potatoes. Bacon gives a slightly different flavor. Note
  that many stores offer canned ham in 6 3/4-oz cans, packaged like tuna
  fish.

      1 lb Tomato sauce                        1 t  Parsley

---------------------------------CHEESE MIX---------------------------------
      2    Eggs, beaten                        1 T  Parsley flakes
     16 oz Ricotta cheese                      1 t  Salt
      8 oz Cottage cheese,                     1 t  Oregano
           -small-curd                              Pepper to taste
    1/2 C  Romano cheese, grated          
 
  Brown meat and drain off fat.  Heat, but don't brown, onions; stir in
  remaining sauce ingredients.  Simmer for about 30 minutes.
  
  Fill a very large pot with water.  Add about 1 t of salt for each quart of
  water in the pot.  Add the lasagna noodles.  Make sure that you cook enough
  noodles to cover a 13x9 baking pan 6 layers deep.  Pre-heat oven to 350
  degrees F.
  
  Grease the inside of the baking pan with a light vegetable oil.  Now make
  three filling layers.  For each, put down 1/3 of the noodles, in two
  layers. Then spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture on the noodles. Then
  sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Finally, top with 1/3 of the
  sauce.  Bake uncovered for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly hot. Let sit for
  5-10 minutes before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A hearty lasagna with lots of meat and cheese -- Carol Angell and Juan
  Ochoa are old friends from Tektronix.  Her lasagna recipe is one of my
  favorites.  Yield:  Serves 8-12.

 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 C  Butter                            1/3 C  Sugar
      8 oz Noodles, uncooked               1 1/2 t  Vanilla extract
      3    Eggs, beaten                       12 oz Pineapple, crushed,
      4 oz Cottage cheese                           -with juice
      2 C  Milk                                     Cornflake crumbs, to top
 
  Melt butter in a 9x13 pan.  Add noodles.
  
  Combine remaining ingredients, except crumbs, spread evenly over noodles.
  Top with crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about an hour.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Noodle kugel using uncooked noodles -- This recipe is interesting
  because you don't cook the noodles first. Yield: Serves 6.
  
  *  This recipe is very simple, but it does taste a little pastier than
  recipes that require the noodles to be cooked first.  It also comes out
  very flat -- most of the kugel recipes I've made in the past use twice as
  many noodles in the same size pan. I found that some of the things can be
  increased, i.e., add more noodles, more pineapple, more cottage cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

      Title: SZEKELY GOULASH
 Categories: Entrees, Hungarian, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Sauerkraut, rinsed                  1 lb Hungarian sausage
           -and drained                             -(or Polish sausage),
           -(use a colander)                        -sliced into large,
      1 T  Caraway seeds                            -bite-size rounds
      2 T  Butter (or oil                      1 lg Onion, chopped
           -or bacon drippings)                1    Green pepper, chopped
      1 lb Pork shoulder, cut into             1 T  Hungarian sweet paprika
           -large, bite-sized pieces                -(or use fresh paprika
      2    Garlic cloves,                           -from the supermarket)
           -finely chopped                     2 C  Sour cream
 
  Use a covered pot large enough to hold all the ingredients.  Put the
  sauerkraut in just enough water to cover it, add caraway seeds, and simmer
  with the cover on for two hours (or longer, if you want).
  
  In a large, heavy skillet melt the butter and brown the pork.  Put the pork
  and the sausage into the pot with the sauerkraut.
  
  Saute the onion in the skillet until transparent; add the garlic and saute
  for a few more minutes. Add this to the pot, along with the green pepper
  and paprika. (I've had good luck adding some cayenne at this point.) Simmer
  (with the cover on loosely) for a couple of hours, mixing it up
  occasionally. Remove from heat and let cool for 30 minutes; then stir in
  the sour cream and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Southern Hungarian Goulash -- This goulash is a specialty of Szekely,
  the southern part of Hungary. My grandmother cooked it without a recipe;
  this recipe is from my mother, with my modifications. (Szekely is not
  pronounced the way it's spelled; say-ki-ee is a little closer, but still
  wrong.)
  
  *  This goes well with noodles, dumplings, potatoes, or spaetzle (called
  nokedli in Hungarian).  The longer it cooks, the better it tastes; it's
  even better reheated. Cook it the day before but don't add the sour cream
  until you've reheated it.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes chopping, many hours cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: COQ AU VIN I
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 lb Chicken pieces                      1 C  Mushrooms (fresh),
      2    Garlic cloves,                           -sliced
           -chopped or pressed                 2 C  Red wine, dry
           -(or less)                               -(young Burgundy,
      1 md Onion, chopped                           -California Zinfandel,
    1/4 C  Parsley, chopped                         -Australian Shiraz)
      1 md Carrot, sliced                           Flour
      2 T  Cooking oil                              Salt and pepper (to taste)
 
  Start by heating the oil in a frying pan.  Brown the chopped onion and
  garlic for a few minutes. Take the chicken pieces and brown them with the
  onion and garlic mixture. Brown the pieces evenly, turning often. This
  should take about 5 minutes.
  
  Sprinkle a little flour over the chicken.  Add salt and pepper if desired.
  Add the wine and remaining ingredients.  Reduce heat and simmer covered for
  1 hour.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken in a wine sauce -- This is a very nice, simple chicken dish.
  Yield:  Serves 2-3.
  
  *  This dish is best served over rice.  Check the amount of wine in the pan
  every so often.  Add a little more if needed.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.

      Title: CHUCK-WAGON BEAN POT
 Categories: Crockpot, Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Bean (any variety), dry             7 oz Green chili salsa
      1    Ham hock or shank                        -(up to 10 oz; or use
      1 lg Onion, chopped                           -tomato sauce, canned
      6 C  Water                                    -or stewed tomatoes)
      1 t  Salt                           
 
  Rinse the beans and remove any foreign matter.  Mix all ingredients in the
  cooking vessel.
  
  IF USING A SLOW-COOKER:  Cover, set temperature at low, and forget for at
  least 10 hours.  If you have only half a day, cook the mixture 5 or more
  hours on high.
  
  IF USING A STOVE:  Heat all ingredients to boiling with pot uncovered. Turn
  down heat, cover, and simmer gently, adding enough boiling water to keep
  beans well covered. Most bean varieties will be done in 2 to 3 hours.
  
  When beans are done, take out ham bone, cut off the meat and put it back
  into the pot. Serve hot with corn bread or muffins. Green chili salsa is a
  Mexican sauce made from green chili peppers, onions, vinegar and other
  ingredients.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Hearty Bean Stew -- I got this recipe from "A Primer on Bean Cookery"
  by the California Dry Bean Advisory Board and other organizations. This
  savory stew, featuring ham and beans, borrows its robust seasonings from
  the chuck wagon cooks of the old western cattle ranges. The secret is long,
  slow cooking, and your electric slow-cooker is ideal for the job. Just
  follow the directions that come with your particular model. If you don't
  have one, slow-cook the mixture on top of the stove in a heavy pot with a
  lid.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, many hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: MEXICAN QUICHE
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      1    Quiche shell,                     1/2 C  Monterey Jack cheese,
           -9 or 10 inches                          -grated
    1/2 lb Shrimp (large),                     3    Eggs, beaten
           -about 12-14, peeled              1/3 C  Chives, chopped (fresh)
           -and deveined                     1/3 C  Sour cream
    1/2 C  Green chilies, chopped            1/4 C  Salsa, green or red,
           -(Ortegas, not jalapenos)                -but fairly hot (use
      5 oz Cream, light                             -taco sauce if nothing
    1/2 C  Colby cheese, grated                     -else is available)
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Bring about 1 quart of water to the boil in
  a saucepan. Add the shrimp and cook for 2 minutes or until they loose their
  raw look, no more. Drain the shrimp in a colander. Reserve 6 nice-looking
  shrimp for later. Chop the rest.
  
  Spread the chopped shrimp over the bottom of the quiche shell.  Use half
  the chilies to make a layer over the shrimp, then a layer of Jack cheese,
  another layer of chilies and a layer of Colby. Spread things evenly.
  
  Mix cream, eggs, chives and a little salt (if you want) in a bowl; beat to
  blend.  Pour this into the quiche shell; it shouldn't overflow.
  
  Place the quiche on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes at 425 degrees
  F. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees F. and bake about 35 minutes longer, or
  until the filling is set. Remove quiche from oven; let it cool for 15
  minutes.
  
  Spoon about 6 T of sour cream in round spots around the top of the quiche.
  Dip each of the reserved shrimp into the salsa and then put them on the
  spots of sour cream. Spoon the left-over salsa on top of the shrimp. Cut
  into six wedges and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Shrimp quiche in a Mexican style -- I found this recipe in the New York
  Times magazine a while back, called "Dave and Janis Murray's Mexican
  Quiche." It's not hard to make and it's quite good.
  
  *  This goes well with a salad and a white wine strong enough to stand up
  to the salsa. If you serve bread, you might be able to feed six people;
  otherwise, count on feeding 3 or 4.
  
  *  For the quiche shell, see a French cookbook, or buy a frozen shell in
  your market. The Monterey Jack cheese might be hard to grate. If so, then
  just chop it into bits with a knife.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy (except perhaps if you make your own pastry);
  de-veining the shrimp is tedious but not difficult.
  
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, one hour to bake and cool.
  : Precision:  Measure the filling ingredients.

      Title: CURRIED SHRIMP AND MACARONI SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Seafood, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/4 C  Mayonnaise                        1/2 C  Water chestnuts,
      2 t  Curry powder                             -slivered, drained
           -(or to taste)                  1 1/3 C  Conchiglie piccole pasta,
      1 lb Shrimp (small), cleaned,                 -cooked (small sea-shell
           -deveined and cooked                     -macaroni; measure before
      2 C  Honeydew balls                           -cooking)
 
  Mix the curry powder into the mayonnaise.  Put the remaining ingredients in
  a large bowl. Dress with the curried mayonnaise. Chill 1-2 hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A cold pasta dish -- This salad is quick and easy.  It's best if made
  several hours  before serving, to get the full curry flavor.  It's been a
  real hit at potlucks. Yield: serves 4 to 6.
  
  *  A honeydew ball is a ball of honeydew melon that is scooped out of the
  flesh of the melon with a "balling spoon" or "melon baller."  About 1 1/3
  cups of conchiglie will make about three cups of cooked macaroni.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  25 minutes (includes time to cook macaroni and make melon balls.)

      Title: CREAM OF BROCCOLI SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Broccoli bunches, fresh             1 md Egg yolk, beaten
           -(each about 3 in bottom          1/4 C  Flour (no lumps)
           -diameter, banded)                1/8 t  Cardamom
    1/2 lb Butter                            1/8 t  Mace
      6    Garlic cloves, chopped fine         1 C  Cream, heavy
           -(less or more to taste)                 -(whipping cream
      1 T  Chervil (fresh or                        -preferred)
           -dried, finely chopped)           1/3 C  Gruyere cheese (fresh,
      1 t  Salt                                     -grated fine)
      1 t  White pepper                      1/3 C  Parmesan cheese (fresh,
      3 C  Milk, full-cream                         -grated to powder)
           -(homogenized)
 
  Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces.  Discard the hard stem pieces, but keep
  tender leaves and stem parts.  Steam the cut broccoli for about 5-8
  minutes, until just bright green in color. Do not overcook.
  
  In a 10-inch enameled (non-metal) skillet, heat about 6 oz of butter until
  melted.  Add chopped garlic and wait until butter is hot enough to cook in.
  Add steamed broccoli, then chervil to the skillet.  Lightly salt the
  broccoli. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally with a
  wooden spoon, for another 5-10 minutes or until the broccoli turns a darker
  green color and becomes very soft.
  
  Mash the broccoli right in the skillet until no large pieces remain.  Use a
  potato masher or a strong wooden spoon.  Mash until there are no pieces
  remaining that are too big to fit in a soup spoon.
  
  While broccoli is cooking, add beaten egg yolk to about 2 cups of milk.
  
  Put about 3 T butter into a 2-3 quart saucepan.  Use enamel or glass for
  best soup flavor. Metal pans will make this soup bitter. Melt butter and
  add flour. When the flour bubbles and starts to cook, add the egg/milk
  mixture into the saucepan. Add the cardamom, mace and white pepper. Stir
  contents of saucepan constantly with wooden spoon until thick. Lower the
  cooking heat.
  
  Empty the mashed broccoli mixture into the saucepan.  Stir until
  well-mixed. Slowly stir in the remaining milk and the cream. As soon as the
  soup becomes hot enough to cook again, add the grated cheeses.
  
  Turn the heat down lower and simmer for about 5 more minutes, stirring to
  allow the cheeses to melt and mix while the table is being set.  Serve
  immediately and retire quickly so as not to be trampled by those who
  smelled it cooking.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Addictive broccoli soup -- This rich soup is a real flavor treat for
  everyone, even for people who don't normally eat broccoli.  It can be
  served as the only course in a light meal. The soup is at its best when
  served with hot, hard French finger rolls and freshly squeezed cool orange
  juice.  It is my own original recipe. You will not have tried it anywhere
  else except at my house. Enjoy. Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  This recipe may be doubled, halved or whatever without penalty.  Vary
  the amount of milk added the second time to change the soup thickness to
  your own tastes. You also may use any fresh green vegetable as a substitute
  for the broccoli. Asparagus tips, artichoke hearts and corn are especially
  nice. Cook them in the same way as you did the broccoli. Use any leftover
  butter on the hard French finger rolls. Warning: This soup is a mild
  aphrodisiac when served as suggested and by candlelight. Use Bailey's Irish
  Cream as a chaser.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes.

  Mix everything together and refrigerate overnight.  Stir again before
  serving. Serve with sturdy dip-ables or crackers, as it will break chips.
  
  NOTES:

      1    Scallion (green onion)         
 
  Cook or thaw the spinach, then squeeze it dry.  Mix the spinach with the
  mayonnaise, sour cream, green onion and soup mix.  Refrigerate for 30
  minutes before serving. Serve with triscuits or a sliced baguette.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple party dip with spinach, leek and sour cream -- Anything that
  tastes this good couldn't be good for you.
  
  *  Knorr brand soup mix is available worldwide, but other brands will work.
  one package, approximately enough to make a liter of soup.

      Title: DAMPER
 Categories: Breads, Australian, Usenet
      Yield: 1 damper
 
  2 1/2 C  Flour, self-raising                 1 C  Milk (or use about
      1 t  Salt                                     -1/2 C of powdered milk
      1 t  Butter                                   -and about 1 C water)
      1 t  Sugar                          
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix together the dry ingredients and the
  butter.   Add the liquid and mix well.  Knead for about 5 minutes (if you
  don't know about kneading, look in a good cookery book with plenty of
  pictures, it's difficult to describe in words).
  
  Shape into a flattened ball and place on a greased and floured baking sheet
  or in a greased and floured round cake tin (I recommend the latter, about 7
  or 8 inch diameter, as it gives a better shape). Bake for 30 minutes. Use a
  Dutch oven if you are cooking in an open fire, and use your experience as
  to cooking time.
  
  Serve in moderately thick slices while still fairly hot.   I'm told that
  golden syrup (a treacle-like substance made as a by-product of cane sugar
  refining)  is the traditional thing to spread on it, and that goes well.
  Jam is good, too.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Bread as made by drovers in the outback -- I don't know how many of you
  realize it, but there is a wealth of TV programmes about cooking from
  around the world. We are lucky in that Australia's SBS network (Special
  Broadcasting Service "multi-cultural television") has a regular slot for
  food and wine at a convenient time on Saturday evenings. Over the last
  couple of years we have seen series on French, Indian, Chinese, English,
  Vegetarian, Australian and Sri Lankan cookery, among others. If you're
  missing out, why not call your local station?
  
  This recipe comes from a series called "Australian Tableland".
  Traditionally, damper should be cooked in the coals of a camp fire, but the
  temperature in an oven is much more consistent! This recipe has the
  advantages of being simple and, with ordinary care, reliable.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: BERRY COBBLER
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 C  Sugar (for sprinkling)            1/2 t  Salt
      4 C  Berries (fresh or frozen)         1/2 C  Milk
      1 C  Sugar (for the batter)            1/4 C  Butter (softened)
      1 C  Flour, all-purpose                       Nutmeg
  1 1/2 t  Baking powder                  
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of sugar on the
  berries and place them in the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish. Combine the
  remaining dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder and salt).
  
  Add the milk and softened butter and beat well.  Spoon the batter over the
  berries.  Sprinkle some nutmeg on top.  Bake for about 45 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Berry cobbler -- This recipe was lifted from _TV Guide's_ series of
  recipes from television stars. It is similar to the recipe for Berry
  Pudding found in Edna Staebler's "Food That Really Schmecks" cookbook.
  
  *  You can use pretty well any type of berry for the base.  A favourite of
  mine is a combination of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries.
  
  *  The base of this turns out to be a bit thin and liquidy.  If you strain
  the juice from the fruit, add a couple of tablespoons of flour to the
  juice, and then pour the juice over the fruit in the baking dish, the base
  will be semi-firm.
  
  *  You do not need to sprinkle the full 1/2 cup of sugar on the berries;
  with sweeter berries, much less will often suffice.
  
  *  If you would like a sweeter, candy-like batter, try adding more sugar to
  the batter.  I wouldn't recommend putting more than about 1 1/4 cups of
  sugar into the batter, though, the crust of the batter will be very
  candy-like, but the centre of the batter will not properly bake if you do.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHINESE MARINATED MEAT
 Categories: Meats, Condiments, Usenet
      Yield: 1 cup
 
----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
    1/4 C  Dry sherry (cooking               1/4 C  Pineapple juice,
           -sherry will do)                         -unsweetened (or use
      2 T  Light soy sauce                          -the juice from the
    1/4 C  Dark soy sauce                           -can of pineapple chunks)
  2 1/2 t  Sugar                             1/2 t  White pepper
    1/4 C  Hoisin sauce                        2 T  Ginger root, cut into
      1 t  Curry powder                             -thin (1/8-inch) slices

--------------------------------MEAT SKEWERS--------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Sirloin tip                        12 oz Pineapple chunks
 
  Combine the ingredients for the marinade; stir well.
  
  Cut meat into bite-size chunks and place on skewers with 2 or 3 chunks of
  pineapple in between the meat pieces.  Marinate the skewers overnight, in a
  covered container, in the refrigerator.
  
  To cook, broil the meat for about 10 minutes (depends on the size of the
  chunks).  When the weather permits, grilling it outdoors on skewers is even
  better.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Broiled beef in a Chinese marinade -- After frequenting a local Chinese
  restaurant, I finally asked for the recipe for the marinade for the meat
  that came on skewers on the pu pu platter. I was given a list of
  ingredients with instructions like "heavy on this, light on this". I
  devised my own amounts from this list. I served it to my family and they
  enjoyed it, so I feel confident sending it to mod.recipes.
  
  *  You may need to double the marinade recipe.  I use a Tupperware
  container made especially for marinating. Any container will do, but it's
  tough having to turn over all those skewers.
  
  *  The hoisin sauce, ginger root and light soy sauce should be available in
  any good grocery store.  Comments, revisions and/or additions will be
  appreciated.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 12 hours marinating, 10 minutes cooking.

           -broken and ground                3/4 C  Golden raisins
           -OR use 1 1/4 t powdered          1/4 C  Prunes, dried, pitted
     14    Allspice berries, ground          3/4 C  Walnuts, chopped
           -OR about 1/2 t allspice                 -(or other nuts)
    1/8 t  Nutmeg, grated                 
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Butter a deep baking dish that has a lid.
  Core the apples but do not peel them.  Arrange them in the dish.  Cut
  apples to fit, if necessary.
  
  Combine all remaining ingredients in bowl.  Mix well (this is where grating
  the butter comes in handy).  Stuff this mixture into the holes and spaces
  in and between the apples.
  
  Bake covered at 400 degrees F. for about 30 minutes.  Serve hot with
  vanilla ice cream (spoon extra sauce over ice cream).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick substitute for apple pie.
  
  *  Grind the cinnamon stick and allspice berries with a coffee grinder;
  makes interesting coffee afterwards. Alternative: Use about 1 1/4 t
  powdered cinnamon and 1/2 t allspice.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
      6    Eggs                                4    Apples
  1 1/2 C  Sugar                               1 lb Muller's Wide Egg
      1 T  Baking powder                            -Noodles (one box)
      1 T  Vanilla                             4 oz Butter (1 stick)
      4 oz Raisins (1 small box)                    Cinnamon (for top)
 
  Peel the apples and and slice them into small wedges.
  
  Beat the eggs until they are foamy, add the sugar gradually and beat well.
  
  Cook the noodles according to package directions.  Drain.
  
  Melt the butter in a 9x13 metal baking pan.  Swirl it around to coat the
  pan, and then pour the excess butter into the egg mixture. Add baking
  powder and vanilla to egg mixture, mix well, and then slowly add drained
  noodles, apples and raisins. Mix thoroughly until all the noodles have been
  coated and look gooey.
  
  Pour the egg/noodle mixture into the metal pan, top with cinnamon if you
  desire, and bake at 425 degrees F. for about 45 minutes to an hour, or
  until the top looks a little brown and crispy. The kugel should feel
  springy to the touch and not be "wet." Let cool, cut into squares and
  serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Egg noodles, raisins, cinnamon and apples.  Yield:  Serves 12.
  
  *  This feeds about 12 very hungry people (knoshers, as we call them) or 16
  normal ones.  What you don't eat right away you can wrap in aluminum foil
  and freeze for a month or two. If it's too sweet for your taste, you can
  use peaches or other fruit instead of the raisins.
  
  *  Warning:  this stuff sits very heavy in the ol' stomach, so don't try to
  eat more than 2 pieces in a 24-hour period.
  
  *  Don't thank me, thank my mom.

      Yield: 10 cups
 
------------------------------MIX INGREDIENTS------------------------------
      2 C  Buttermilk powder                   8 t  Baking powder
      8 C  Flour, all-purpose                  4 t  Baking soda
    1/2 C  Sugar, granulated                   2 t  Salt

      1    Egg, beaten                         1 C  Water, or more
      2 T  Vegetable oil                            -as needed
  1 1/2 C  Pancake mix                  
 
  MAKE PANCAKE MIX:  Sift the ingredients together well.  Store in a
  container with a tight-fitting lid.
  
  MAKE 10 PANCAKES:  Mix ingredients until blended together.  Let it stand
  five minutes. Cook some pancakes. Eat and enjoy.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A make-it-yourself mix for buttermilk pancakes -- This recipe comes from
  the "More Make-a-mix Cookery" cookbook put out by HP Books.  The premise of
  this book and its predecessor, Make-a-mix Cookery is that you can save time
  and money by making your own mixes for every stage of dinner planning.  It
  seems to work.  Yield:  10 cups of mix of mix.
  
  *  Use the mix within 6 months of when you make it.
  
  *  The pancakes made from this mix aren't as sweet as those made from Aunt
  Jemima mix, but they are good.  You can always add sugar, of course.
  
  *  Although we haven't tried this (yet), you could probably vary the recipe
  by using a different type of flour to make, for example, your own buckwheat
  pancakes.
  
  *  If you can't find buttermilk powder in your local grocery store, try a
  bulk food store.

      Title: BREAKFAST CASSEROLE
 Categories: Breakfast, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8 lg Eggs                                2 lb Sausage, bulk
  2 1/2 C  Milk                                     -(see note)
      3 C  Bread cubes                         1 lb Cheddar, grated
      1 t  Mustard, dry                             -(or more to taste)
    1/2 lb Mushrooms, fresh                  
 
  Brown the sausage in a frying pan; drain off excess fat.  Set aside.
  
  In a large bowl, beat the eggs.  Add milk, mustard and bread cubes.  If you
  like salty dishes, add a teaspoon of salt.  Wait a few minutes for the
  bread cubes to absorb the milk and eggs. Stir in 80 percent of the grated
  cheese. Add the cooked and drained sausage. Mix well. Pour into a casserole
  dish of the size that you would use to make lasagna (about 9 x 13 inches).
  
  Slice the mushrooms and arrange the slices on top of the casserole.
  Sprinkle the remaining 20 percent of the cheese over the top of the
  mushrooms.  Bake for 45 minutes at 350 degrees F. Let cool 10 minutes
  before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A baked egg, sausage and bread casserole -- I got this recipe from a
  recipe chain letter when I was in graduate school. "Send 5 recipes to the
  person whose name is at the top of the list, and then add your name to the
  bottom of the list and send it to 5 friends." I ended up getting about 30
  recipes that way; this is the only one that I still make. It's wonderful.
  The person who mailed it to me is named Ruth Ann Swart. I've changed it
  slightly because I don't like to leave raw egg mixtures in the refrigerator
  overnight, as the original recipe called for. Yield: serves 6-8.
  
  *  You can cut up your own bread for the bread cubes, or else buy a package
  of commercial poultry stuffing. Try to get unflavored bread cubes if you
  buy them.
  
  *  For the sausage, try Spanish chorizo, English Cumberland sausage, or
  American pork whole-hog sausage.  I usually use a mixture of beef chorizo
  and Jimmy Dean pork sausage. Any spicy pork- or beef-based sausage will
  work.
  
  *  For the cheese, the best bet is Canadian sharp white cheddar.  You can
  substitute any cheddar, or Leicester, or Cantal, or for that matter
  anything you want. I've never tried it with Swiss cheeses.

      Title: GREAT GRAPE CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3    Chicken breasts, halved,            1    Green onion,
           -boned, skinned (6 halves,               -thinly sliced (use
           -about 3 lb in all)                      -part of the top)
      2 T  Butter (or margarine)               1 C  Grapes, seedless
      1 T  Orange marmalade (I suggest              -(try red grapes,
           -fresh coarsely-grated                   -such as "Flame")
           -orange peel)                     1/4 C  Cream, whipping
    1/4 t  Tarragon, crumbled                       Salt
    1/3 C  White wine, dry                          Nutmeg
 
  Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and nutmeg.  Brown lightly in heated
  butter in a large frying pan. Add marmalade, tarragon, green onion and
  wine. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Add grapes, cover again and continue cooking about 10 minutes longer, until
  chicken is cooked through (test with a small, sharp knife in thickest
  part).
  
  Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken and grapes to a warm serving dish;
  keep warm. Add cream to liquid in pan. Bring to boiling, stirring, and cook
  until reduced and slightly thickened. Salt to taste. Pour sauce over
  chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken in wine with grapes and orange -- This recipe was originally
  posted by Wayne Thompson. I thought it was great, and I submit it here with
  some variations. This colors in this dish are a feast for the eyes. The
  recipe comes originally from "Elegant Meals with Inexpensive Meats," by
  Ortho Books. Yield: Serves 4 to 6.
  
  *  (WT) I use a whole cut up chicken.
  
  *  (CSR) I like to cook the chicken in a black cast-iron pan; I skip the
  cream sauce, because it smothers the beautiful black-green-red-orange-tan
  colors.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHOCOLATE-CHIP COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 1 dozen
 
      1 C  Flour (plus 2 T)                    6 T  Brown sugar
    1/2 t  Salt                              1/2 t  Vanilla extract
    1/2 t  Baking soda                         1 lg Egg
    1/2 C  Butter, softened                    6 oz Nestle's chocolate
           -(1 stick)                               -chips (1 package)
      6 T  Sugar, white                   
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Sift flour, salt, baking soda together in a
  small bowl.
  
  In another bowl, mix butter with two sugars, vanilla and egg until smooth.
  gradually mix dry stuff in with butter mixture.  Mix in chocolate chips.
  Put blobs of dough on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F. for
  8-10 minutes.
  
  Important: double all proportions above (always make 2 x  as much of these
  as the recipe calls for). Let's face it: small is beautiful, but big
  cookies are better than small ones. All the printed recipes call for teeny
  cookies, dropped by teaspoonsful onto cookie sheets (yield 50). My "blobs
  of dough" are golf-ball sized, which makes healthy 3-4 inch cookies.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cookies like what Mom should have made -- There is no substitute for
  chocolate-chip cookies, warm out of the oven, washed down with cold milk.
  This is Mom's recipe, and Mom's Mom's recipe.  This is also Nestle's "Toll
  House" recipe, and the Joy of Cooking "Chocolate-Chip Drop Cookies" recipe,
  etc, which is no coincidence.  This is the default recipe.  This is not
  Mrs. Field's recipe. If you want Mrs. Field's, use a shopping mall; if you
  want simple, elegant, timeless chocolate-chip cookies, use this recipe.
  Yield:  12 big cookies.
  
  *  I invariably make these on the spur of the moment, and so usually nuke
  the butter in a microwave to soften it up. I also occasionally cheat and
  soften up the butter/sugar mixture a tad in the oven.
  
  *  Try adding walnuts, macadamia, white chocolate, orange peel,
  butterscotch chips, or mint, all these are welcome variations. But keep it
  simple.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: CHOCOLATE BROWN SUGAR COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 3 dozen
 
    1/2 C  Brown sugar                              Flour (1.1 C --> glass
    1/2 lb Butter                                   -measuring cup filled
    1/3 C  Honey                                    -to the top)
      1 lg Egg                               1/2 t  Baking soda
    1/2 t  Vanilla extract                     1 C  Chocolate chips
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the brown
  sugar, add egg and vanilla. Mix well. Add honey.
  
  Measure flour and baking soda (I usually just mix the soda in with the
  flour.) Add flour and soda to batter a little at a time and mix. Add
  chocolate chips.
  
  Drop by spoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 5-8 minutes
  at 375 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate chip cookies with honey and brown sugar.
  
  *  For those of you who like your cookies warm!  I always make up only
  enough to eat, and store the batter in the fridge.
  
  *  You can substitute margarine for the butter if you want.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food
  processor is tedious.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: KALBI KUI
 Categories: Meats, Korean, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Short ribs                          3 T  Olive oil
      1 T  Bouillon powder                     3 T  Sesame oil
    1/4 C  Water                               2    Scallions, diced
 
  Marinate the ribs in the rest of the ingredients for several hours (or
  overnight) in a covered dish in the refrigerator.  Turn at least once
  half-way through the marinating time. (I put it in the refrigerator the
  night before, then turn the ribs in the morning and put them back in the
  refrigerator until dinnertime.) Broil 5 minutes each side.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Korean marinated ribs -- Suitable for Passover.
  
  *  This is traditional for Passover in our house (well, we like Oriental
  food, and Passover is somewhat limiting...).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  Several hours marinating, 15 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: SWEDISH CHOCOLATE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 1 cake
 
      1 C  Shortening                          2 t  Baking powder
  1 1/2 C  Sugar                               1 t  Salt
      3    Eggs                              1/4 t  Baking soda
      2 oz Baking chocolate                    1 C  Cream, heavy
           -(unsweetened), melted              2 t  Vanilla extract
      2 C  Cake flour                     
 
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Butter a Bundt pan and sprinkle with about
  2 T dry bread crumbs, until it is well-coated. This makes a much better
  crust than flour does.
  
  In a large bowl, add the sugar to the shortening and cream well.  Blend in
  the eggs, one at a time, and beat well. Stir in the melted chocolate.
  
  Sift together the dry ingredients.  Combine the cream and vanilla extract.
  Add to the chocolate mixture alternately with the dry ingredients,
  beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Pour the batter into the pan
  and bake for 50-60 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan a few minutes before
  removing.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich chocolate Bundt cake -- I got this recipe from my mom, who got it
  from an American book called Swedish Baking. I like to make this because it
  does not need to be frosted, which makes it an easy dessert.  Yield:  one
  Bundt cake.
  
  *  This is not an authentic Swedish recipe because their flour is different
  enough to cause problems in baking.  However, the results seem authentic.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE
 Categories: Cheesecakes, Usenet
      Yield: 16 servings
 
    1/2 lb Chocolate wafers,                   3 T  Flour, white
           -finely crushed                     3 lg Eggs
    1/3 C  Butter, melted                      2 T  Cream, heavy
  1 1/2 lb Cream cheese,                       2 t  Vanilla
           -at room temperature                1 C  Sour cream
      1 C  Sugar, granulated                   2 t  Vanilla
      6 oz Chocolate, semisweet,               2 T  Sugar, granulated
           -melted and cooled             
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Mix chocolate wafer crumbs and butter.
  Press firmly onto bottom and about 2 inches up the sides of an ungreased,
  9-inch springform pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and
  place on rack to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F.
  
  Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until it is
  smooth.  Add sugar, chocolate and flour.  Beat again, until the mixture is
  well blended and fluffy.
  
  Add eggs, one at a time, beating again after each egg is added.  Beat in
  the cream and vanilla. Pour mixture into the cooled crust. Place on middle
  rack in oven and bake for 60 to 65 minutes, until filling is set. Remove
  from oven and cool on rack.
  
  Blend sour cream, vanilla and sugar together until well mixed.  Spread over
  top of cooled cheesecake.  Chill several hours or overnight
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Picture-perfect chocolate cheesecake -- You may have seen this on the
  cover of a recent magazine when you were standing in the grocery line. It
  makes a very rich, truly decadent chocolate cheesecake.
  
  *  A chocolate wafer is a crisp chocolate cookie about three inches in
  diameter and an eighth of an inch thick.  If you can't find them, you can
  substitute any kind of dry crunchy chocolate-flavored cookie.
  
  *  You can make the crust and filling in a food processor if you have one.
   It makes it a lot easier.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes to prepare, 70 minutes to cook, several hours to chill.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

-----------------------------------GLAZE:-----------------------------------
    1/2 C  Sugar                             1/3 C  Lemon juice
  1 1/2 t  Cornstarch                          1    Egg yolk, WELL BEATEN
    1/4 t  Salt                                1 T  Butter
    3/4 C  Water                          
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine crust ingredients.  Press crust on
  bottom and sides of buttered 10-inch springform pan.  Bake 5 minutes and
  cool.
  
  Beat cheese until soft.  Add sugar and blend well.  Add eggs, one at a
  time, beating well after each. Mix in the lemon rind and the vanilla, and
  add to the mixture. Pour into the pre-baked crust and bake 35 minutes.
  
  Combine topping ingredients, spread on top of cheesecake, and return to
  oven immediately. Bake 10-12 minutes and remove from oven.
  
  Combine dry glaze ingredients; add liquid glaze ingredients.  Cook over low
  heat until thick.  Add about 1 T of butter.  Cool and spread this glaze on
  the cake before the glaze thickens too much.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Legendary cheesecake -- This is from a dessert-chef friend of a
  regular-chef friend and apparently won some award.  I've had cheesecakes
  that I think are more impressive (including one I can make), but I think
  I'm something of a cheesecake connoisseur. If I want to blow people's socks
  off, this is the one I cook. I think that every time I've served it to a
  new group, at least one person has said "That was the best cheesecake I've
  ever had."
  
  *  Some pointers:  this is the traditional crust, but I often use a more
  floury-baked-pie-crust-like one.  It's not too critical.  The magic to
  getting the texture perfect is in how you beat the cheese. I use a kitchen
  aid, work slowly, scrape the bowl often, and ALWAYS USE ROOM TEMPERATURE
  EVERYTHING. Using cold cream cheese guarantees lumps. Don't beat too hard
  before putting in the sugar, but make sure it's even and fluffy before the
  eggs go in. Then again, don't over-beat. It takes practice.
  
  *  I've been known to make it with no sugar or vanilla in the topping, and
  I think it's more interesting. but the contrast between the layers may
  confuse those accustomed to restaurant cheesecakes.
  
  *  The glaze is easy as glazes go, but treat it properly.  In particular,
  stir constantly until it's thick, but don't stir hard or you'll break down
  the starch.
  
  : Difficulty:  rather difficult (timing is critical.)
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: MANGO MILK SHAKE
 Categories: Drinks, Indian, Fruit, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Mango pulp (see note)               3 T  Sugar
      6 C  Milk, whole                        12    Ice cubes
 
  Put into a blender about half (to one third) of the mango pulp, about 3
  cups milk, about 1 1/2 T sugar and 6 ice cubes into the blender. Blend
  until smooth. Serve. Repeat quickly, as people will already be asking for
  more.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A refreshing Indian summer drink -- This is a delicious, refreshing and
  easy-to-make drink for hot summer days.  Yield:  6 12-oz drinks.
  
  *  Canned mango pulp is available in Indian and Latin American grocery
  stores. The "mango nectar" that is widely available in American grocery
  stores does not have nearly enough mangoes per unit volume to make this
  drink.  If you are lucky enough to be able to get fresh mangoes, you can
  use the flesh of one ripe mango for about 1 cup of the mango pulp; if you
  do that, increase the amount of sugar to about 2 tablespoon per batch, as
  canned mango pulp always has added sugar.
  
  *  You can make interesting variations on this recipe by using plain yogurt
  for some or all of the milk, and by adding a tart counterbalance to the
  mangoes, such as shredded kiwi fruit.
  
  : Difficulty:  trivial.
  : Time:  3 minutes.
  : Precision:  no need to measure ingredients.

    1/2 ga Sherbet (use your                        -occasion)
           -favorite flavor or one             2 qt Ginger ale

  NOTES:
  
  *  A non-alcoholic party punch recipe -- This is a super non-alcoholic
  punch with lots of possible variations.
  
  *  Different sherbet flavors or mixtures of flavors make for many
  variations. I once made a variation that replaced 1/2 of the ginger ale
  with lemonade. Super!

      4 T  Soy sauce                           2    Bay leaves
           -(or more to taste)                 2 T  Cooking oil
 
  Put vinegar, bay leaves, pepper, soy sauce and water in a saucepan.  Cover
  and cook slowly about 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, heat the cooking oil in a large, heavy-bottomed frying pan. Peel
  the garlic, break the cloves into chunks and brown them over medium-low
  heat (about 5 minutes). Add the chicken to the frying pan and brown it over
  medium-high heat (about 5 minutes).
  
  Add the broth to the frying pan and simmer, partly covered, until the
  chicken is done (about 30 minutes). Do not let it come to a boil.
  
  Remove the bay leaves and serve over rice.  This dish is too strongly
  flavored to go well with wine; try serving it with beer.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Filipino chicken with garlic -- Adobo is the national dish of the
  Philippines.  Most warm-weather countries have through the centuries
  developed recipes that preserve food while flavoring it. This dish is
  different than many because of its strong component of vinegar. It is at
  once sour, salty and drenched in garlic.
  
  *  You can substitute pork for the chicken, or mix the two.  In the
  Philippines it is the custom to marinate the meat for two days rather
  before simmering; with the top-grade meats that are universally available
  in our grocery stores, that is not necessary (though it does deepen and
  enrich the flavor). To marinate the chicken, mix in the broth and 3 of the
  garlic cloves after step 1, then put the chicken in a glass dish and pour
  the marinade over it.

      Title: JEFFREY'S RASTA REDFISH MARINADE
 Categories: Condiments, Fish, Usenet
      Yield: 5 cups
 
      2 oz Tamarind (dried)                  1/2 C  Ginger root, chopped
    1/2 C  Water, boiling                      1 t  Garlic, chopped
      4 lb Mangos, unripe                      1 t  Fresh hot chilies,
      2 C  Malt vinegar                             -chopped
      1 C  Sugar                             1/2 t  Allspice, ground
    1/2 C  Raisins                             2 T  Salt
 
  Place the tamarind in a bowl and pour boiling water over it.  Soak for an
  hour.  Drain, pressing down hard with the back of a spoon before discarding
  the seeds and fibers.
  
  Peel each mango and cut flesh away from seed.  Cut into one-inch cubes.
  Combine the mangos and vinegar and bring to a boil over high heat and cook
  for 10 minutes.
  
  Stir in the sugar, raisins, ginger root, garlic, chilies, allspice and
  salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes. Cool. Puree
  the mixture in a blender and it's ready for the fish.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A marinade for redfish -- From Jeffrey's restaurant in Austin, Texas,
  our favorite place to go for good food in the city. Marinate a fresh
  redfish in this for 12 hours, then broil it.
  
  *  Marinade can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 weeks.  Mangos are a
  seasonal fruit.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour soaking, 30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 12 hours
  marinating.

      Title: VEGETARIAN MOUSSAKA
 Categories: Entrees, Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 12 servings
 
--------------------------------TOMATO SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 lg Onions                              3    Tomatoes, peeled
      2 T  Olive oil                                -and pureed
      2 T  Butter                            3/4 C  Red wine, dry
      2 C  Mushrooms, minced                 1/2 C  Parsley, chopped

           -lamb for the mushrooms)            1 t  Sugar
      3 T  Tomato paste              

-------------------------------BECHAMEL SAUCE-------------------------------
      4 C  Milk                              1/8 t  Nutmeg
    1/2 C  Butter                            1/4 t  White pepper
      6 T  Flour                         

-------------------------------THE CASSEROLE-------------------------------
           Olive oil                           1 C  Bread crumbs, dry
      3 lb Eggplant                            2 C  Kefalotyri or Parmesan
      4    Eggs, beaten                             -cheese, grated
      2 C  Ricotta cheese                 
 
  First make the tomato sauce:  peel and mince onions.  Saute onions in about
  2 T oil and about 2 T butter, over moderate heat, until they are soft and
  lightly colored (about 8 minutes).  Add mushrooms and saute.  Stir in
  tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, parsley, seasonings and sugar.
  
  Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered, for 30-45 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Most of the liquid should be evaporated, and the mixture
  quite thick. Remove skillet from heat and let it cool completely.
  
  Start seasoning the eggplants:  peel eggplants and slice vertically, about
  1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit for 30
  minutes.
  
  Now make the Bechamel Sauce:  Place the milk in a saucepan and heat it just
  until tiny bubbles appear along the edges.  Remove and set aside.
  
  Melt one cube butter in a 3-quart saucepan over very low heat until foamy,
  being careful not to brown.  Slowly add the 6 T  flour, stirring constantly
  until smooth (3-4 minutes), and still being careful not to let it brown.
  Add the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk. When the mixture is thick
  and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in seasonings. Cool sauce
  slightly.
  
  Back to the eggplant:  Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and  pat
  dry.  Dredge the eggplant in about 1 1/2 cups flour and saute in olive oil.
  
  Put it all together:  Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth and creamy.
  Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce.  Stir in beaten  eggs until
  thoroughly incorporated.
  
  Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the top of the tomato
  mixture.
  
  Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan and sprinkle the bottom with a few bread
  crumbs.  Place a layer of eggplant in the pan, following with a layer of
  tomato mixture.  Sprinkle with bread crumbs and grated cheese.  Repeat as
  many times as you have eggplant to last.
  
  Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 degrees F. for
  one hour, or until a golden-brown crust has formed on top.  Remove moussaka
  from oven and let it stand undisturbed 20-30 minutes; the delay allows the
  layers to fuse.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Vegetarian version of the Greek classic -- This recipe is not for the
  faint-hearted.  It's very good and it takes a lot of work.  Don't waste it
  on someone who would be just as satisfied with steak and salad!
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 1/2 hours to prepare, 1 hour to bake, 20-30 minutes to set and
  cool.  Some can be done ahead of time.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK for eggplant, tomato mixture.

      Title: STIR-FRIED EGGPLANT
 Categories: Stir-fry, Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 T  Sesame oil (or                      6    Szechuan peppers
           -a mixture of sesame                1 lg Eggplant, cubed
           -oil and clear vegetable            2    Garlic cloves,
           -oil, to taste)                          -crushed or minced
 
  In a wok heat the oil, then toss in the Szechuan peppers.  After about 30
  seconds (long enough for the scent to be released) toss in the cubed
  eggplant and the garlic. Stir-fry over moderately high heat until the
  eggplant is tender (about 10 minutes.) Remove the peppers before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple Chinese-style recipe for fresh eggplant -- My favorite for
  eggplants out of the garden is to stir-fry them with garlic and hot peppers
  in sesame oil, according to this simple recipe.
  
  *  I've heard it said that the Armenians judge the value of a woman by how
  many ways she can cook eggplant.

      1 lg Eggplant                            1 t  Salt
      3    Garlic cloves,                      2 t  Red hot chili peppers,
           -sliced or chopped                       -fresh

      1 t  Sugar                          
 
  Cut the eggplant into long quarter-round strips.  Bake them at 400 200 for
  20-25 minutes, or until they are soft but not mushy.
  
  Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix the onion, garlic, tomatoes, salt, sugar, peppers
  and water and mash with a wooden spoon until it forms a coarse paste.
  
  Fry the tomato paste in the oil until the liquid is reduced (about 10
  minutes).  Pour the sauce over the eggplant and serve immediately
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indonesian baked eggplant in chili sauce -- I got this recipe originally
  from an Indonesian cookbook.  It's a nice way to cook eggplant.

      Title: BUSY DAY COBBLER
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 C  Butter (or margarine,              13 oz Tart cherries
           -if you must)                            -(one normal U.S. can)
    1/2 C  Sugar                               2 T  Sugar (to sweeten
    2/3 C  Milk                                     -and thicken; use less
      1 C  Flour                                    -or more as needed)
      2 t  Baking powder                  
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Drain cherries, saving liquid.
  
  Cream butter and sugar together.  Alternately add in milk and sifted dry
  ingredients.  Pour into a buttered and floured casserole dish.  Top evenly
  with cherries.  Sprinkle sugar on top and cover with saved liquid/juice.
  Bake 45-50 minutes.
  
  The batter will expand and surround the cherries so they're evenly mixed
  throughout the cobbler.  The juice will congeal to fruity and pudding-like.
  Serve warm topped with cream, milk or ice cream.  (I prefer milk).  If any
  is left, it's good cold, too.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An extremely quick cherry cobbler dessert -- This recipe came from a PTA
  recipe collection from my Aunt's school a number of years ago.  It's not a
  true, classic cobbler, but I think it's better.  My favorite dessert!
  
  *  As the name implies, this is a very quick recipe to make.  Depending on
  how soft the butter is to start with, or whether or if you use a food
  processor (I don't, but it should work) this recipe takes only 5 to 10
  minutes to mix.
  
  *  You can use any unsweetened canned fruit for this recipe.  You can also
  use frozen fruit, by thawing it before adding to the pan. Berries or
  peaches are standard substitutes. Yesterday I made one with crushed
  pineapple.  I used brown, rather than white sugar atop the fruit. It tasted
  very much like pineapple upside down cake (though the appearance was a bit
  different).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, I've been making this since I was about 8 or 9.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: END-OF-MONTH VEGETABLE SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2    Chinese cabbage                     1    Bouquet garni (e.g.,
    1/2    Carrot                                   -about 1 t each parsley
    1/2    Red bell pepper                          -and thyme, 1 or 2 bay
      1    Yellow onion                             -leaves)
      4 sm Potatoes                            2    Chicken or beef bouillon
    1/8 lb Bacon pieces                             -cubes
           -(for seasoning)                    2    Garlic cloves
      4    Prosciutto end bits                      Pepper (to taste)
           -(for seasoning, optional)          1 C  White wine (optional)
      5    Stalks celery                  
 
  Make the bouquet garni by tying the herbs up in a cheesecloth or coffee
  filter.  Put a quart of water to boil with about 1/2 t salt (I don't like
  to use too much salt if I use bouillon), the bouquet garni and the
  bouillon.
  
  Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and add these to the soup together with
  the bacon and/or prosciutto ends. Bring this to a boil. Simmer 5 minutes.
  If scum forms on the surface, skim it off.
  
  Dice the potatoes and add to the boiling pot.  Cut up everything else and
  add it. Add the wine. Adjust the liquid so that it covers the vegetables.
  After it boils again, adjust the seasoning and simmer for about an hour, or
  until it is done (this is quite subjective).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Soup with a mixture of vegetables -- I had an eclectic mixture of
  vegetables going bad in the refrigerator, so I collected them and came up
  with this soup. It was very good, so I would like to share it with you all.
  Caveat:  I rarely measure anything, so be careful of quantities.
  
  *  This will serve 6 people at once, or 2 people for three days.  It ages
  well in the refrigerator.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour simmering.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: BANGIN' BART
 Categories: Entrees, Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lg Eggplants, unpeeled,                2 T  Oil (or clarified
           -diced                                   -butter)
      2 lg Tomatoes, diced                     2 t  Salt
      2 lg Onions, finely chopped              1 t  Black pepper
 
  In a large frying pan, saute the onion in the oil until it is translucent.
  Add the spices and stir for 1 minute.  Add the eggplant and tomato, stir
  well and cover. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are mushy (about
  1/2 hour).
  
  Remove the lid and continue cooking until most of the liquid evaporates
  (about 15 minutes). The finished dish should be thick enough that you could
  use it as a dip.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indian eggplant, onion and tomato casserole -- This is an Indian dish,
  called Baigan Bartha in Hindi.  We make it a lot and call it "Bangin'
  Bart." It is eggplant, onions and tomatoes, but not in the usual way.
  
  In this recipe, the vegetables are cooked to mush, with only a small amount
  of tomato, just enough to flavor it. Yield: serves 6-8.
  
  *  I don't make this with any spices but salt and pepper.  The genuine
  Indian version of the recipe adds various Indian spices; try about 1 t of
  fresh ginger, about 1/2 t of turmeric, about 1/2 t of cayenne, and about 1
  t of garam masala for a more authentic Indian flavor.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.

      Yield: 1 batch
 
      3 lg Tomatoes, cut                            -cut into 1/4-inch slices
           -into 1/2-inch slices               1 lg White onion, cut into
  1 1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese,                       -thin slices (optional)
 
  Cut the eggplant lengthwise once, then slice crosswise into semi-disks
  about 3/4 inch thick.
  
  In a shallow casserole dish (about 2 in deep), stand some slices of
  eggplant on the narrow cut edge, to make a row, then follow this with
  slices of tomato, then slices of mozzarella cheese. Repeat until the whole
  dish is full.  It should appear from the top to have bands of red, white
  and black.
  
  Use your favorite seasoning (basil/oregano is the default), and bake until
  bubbly (about 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Eggplant casserole with tomato and cheese -- From "Victory Garden
  Cookbook" maybe? Anyway, that's an excellent source for ideas...
  
  *  You may wish to put a layer of onions on the bottom, horizontally,
  before you put the eggplant in the pan.
  
  *  This only works with European-style eggplant; Japanese and Asian
  eggplants are too narrow.

  Stir until everything is melted.  When the chocolate is melted thoroughly,
  beat with electric mixer (I ain't proud!) until smooth.
  
  Let cook to halfway between soft and medium ball stage (use candy
  thermometer if available). Let cool until barely touchable (due to heat).
  Stir in chopped walnuts, vanilla and rum. Beat the mixture until it starts
  to set.
  
  When it starts to set, get it into an 8-inch square pan (buttered, of
  course). If you wait to do this, you will eat it out of the saucepan.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rich fattening chocolate fudge -- This recipe makes fudge.  Not fudge
  brownies, just fudge.  I'm not sure what else to say about it.  Yield:
  Makes 1 8-inch pan.
  
  *  This is guaranteed to cause obesity if over-indulged in.
  
  : Difficulty:  Moderate to hard.  Melted chocolate is tricky, and the
  timing is fairly important.
  : Time:  about an hour.
  : Precision:  Measurement important for some ingredients.

      Title: TENO SALMON
 Categories: Fish, Lapp, Usenet
      Yield: 1 serving
 
    3/4 lb Salmon, per person                       Water, butter, salt
 
  Cross cut 1-inch slices from the salmon.  I prefer slices about the size of
  my palm but also smaller ones will do. Use toothpicks to bind them into
  round cutlets.
  
  Pour about 1/4 inch water into a frying pan and bring it to a boil. Add
  cutlets and simmer until the water has evaporated.  Turn cutlets once
  during cooking.
  
  Add butter, fry lightly on both sides.  Add salt to taste and remove
  toothpicks.
  
  Serve with boiled or mashed potatoes and sliced lemon.  (Lemon is not
  traditional, but...)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional salmon dish from Lappland -- This is the traditional way to
  prepare salmon on the river Teno (the northern border river between Norway
  and Finland).
  
  : Difficulty:  very easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes to prepare, 20 minutes to cook.
  : Precision:  don't let water cover the cutlets.

      Title: SHABBOS-CHOULNT
 Categories: Soups, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Meat                                5 sm Onions
      1 lb Meat bones                        1/4 lb Carrots
      1 lb Potatoes                            4 C  Water (or more)
    1/2 C  Barley                                   Salt
    3/4 C  Red beans                                Seasoning, to taste
    3/4 C  Lima beans                     
 
  Put everything in a big pot, season to taste and let it cook over a low
  fire over night. It should cook 18 to 24 hours.
  
  The water should not boil dry, nor should a high fire be used, or it will
  burn.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  European Jewish traditional sabbath stew -- This is a food that
  religious Jewish people eat on Saturday afternoon. Religious people do not
  cook on Saturday, so this food must be put on the stove on Friday, before
  sunset. It then cooks overnight, filling the house with a delicious aroma,
  until after services Saturday afternoon. Shabbos means "Saturday" in
  Hebrew, and choulnt means "a mishmosh" in Yiddish. (choulnt in fact comes
  originally from the French chaud lent which means "warm slowly") The amount
  of each ingredient depends on what taste one likes, how much is available,
  and the tradition handed down by one's parents or Rebbitzin (Rabbi's wife).
  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  Variations:  Some communities add some eggs (in the shell), and lots of
  curry.  (in which case it is called Chamin, which means "warm food.")
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 day cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: LIHAPIIRAKKA
 Categories: Meats, Finnish, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      3 oz Butter                              1 oz Yeast cake
      1 C  Milk                                     -(or 1 package
    1/3 C  Sugar                                    -of dried yeast)
      3 C  Wheat flour                

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 lg Yellow onion                    1 1/4 C  Rice, cooked
      1 lb Meat, ground                             -(left-over rice is fine)
           -(mixed beef and pork)              1    Egg
      1 C  Cream                                    Salt and pepper
 
  MAKE THE DOUGH:  melt the butter and add milk.  Heat the mixture to 100
  degrees F.  Crumble the yeast into a bowl.  Add the butter-and-milk mixture
  and whip it until the yeast as dissolved.  Add sugar, salt and flour and
  stir until it becomes a dough. Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place
  for about 40 minutes.
  
  While the dough rises, chop the onion into very small pieces and put in a
  large frying pan.  Add the ground meat immediately and saute for 10
  minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cooked rice and saute this mixture
  another 5 minutes. Add the cream, season to taste with salt and pepper, and
  turn off the heat. Let the frying pan stand on the stove, covered, until
  the dough is ready. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
  
  Roll out the dough so it fits in a 12x16 inch baking dish.  Put the dough
  into the dish so that the dough covers the whole dish (this is the most
  difficult part; don't be discouraged if you have to roll out the dough
  again).
  
  Add the filling on top of the dough.  Whip the egg and spread it over the
  filling.  Bake it on the bottom rack in the oven for about 20 minutes.
  
  When the pie has cooled off a bit; cut it into pieces that are about 1 1/4
  inches by 6 inches (the traditional size of lihapiirakka in Finland).
  Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Finnish meat pie -- This is an excellent-tasting stomach filler.  My
  dear mother gave me this recipe when I moved away from home. She probably
  thought that it would give me that feeling of home. It does. I have tried
  it on my friends and it is always a hit. My mother is from Finland. Yield:
  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  While eating lihapiirakka, you can try the hard work of pronouncing its
  name.  Liha means meat and piirakka is just piirakka.  The filling can of
  course be varied.  Other traditional Finnish fillings for other piirakkas
  are blueberries (with some potato flour on top) and cottage cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the crust ingredients carefully.

      Title: SPANAKOPITA
 Categories: Entrees, Greek, Appetizers, Usenet
      Yield: 20 pieces

      1 lb Filo dough                          3    Leeks, washed and
    1/2 C  Olive oil                                -chopped
      3 lb Spinach (5 packages,                1 lb Feta cheese
           -if you use frozen                  1 C  Bread crumbs
           -spinach)                           1 C  Milk
    1/2 C  Butter, unsalted                    1 t  Salt
      1 md Onion, chopped                           Pepper
      5    Eggs
 
  If you are using fresh spinach, wash it, dip it for a minute or two in
  boiling water to blanch it, and then chop it. Drain the spinach and squeeze
  most of the water out of it.
  
  Wash thoroughly and chop the white part of the leeks.  Peel and chop the
  onion.  Saute the chopped leeks and onion in the butter.  Add the spinach,
  salt and pepper.  Mix everything together and simmer for 20 minutes.
  
  While the spinach is cooking, grate the feta cheese (I use a food
  processor). Alternatively, you can crumble it into small chunks.
  
  Remove the spinach from heat and add the cheese, eggs (beaten), bread
  crumbs and milk. Mix everything together and set aside. Grease a square
  baking pan with a little olive oil. Take one sheet of dough and place it on
  the bottom of the pan towards one of the corners, in such a way that the
  dough sticks out a little from two of the sides of the pan. Brush the sheet
  with olive oil. Repeat this step until you have used about two thirds of
  the dough, alternating corners and always brushing each sheet of dough with
  olive oil.
  
  Pour the spinach mixture into the pan.  Level it, and fold in the sides of
  the assembled crust. Brush the dough with olive oil. Take one sheet of
  dough and place it on top of the pie, this time without any bias towards
  any of the corners. Brush the sheet with olive oil. Repeat this step until
  you have used all the remaining dough, always brushing each sheet with
  olive oil.
  
  Gently tuck the edges of the top sheets of dough under the sides of the
  pie. Brush the top with olive oil. Using a sharp knife cut the top of the
  pie as if you were cutting it to serve it, but don't go all the way to the
  bottom. Sprinkle the pie with 1 T of water and bake it at 350 degrees F.
  for 45 minutes. Let the pie cool and serve.
  
  Unless you work quickly when assembling the dough layers, the unused pieces
  of dough will dry out. Until you become nimble with this process, you can
  cover the unused dough pieces with a damp dishcloth to prevent them from
  drying out while you fumble with the construction of the pie.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Greek spinach and feta cheese pie -- This recipe is from a greek
  cookbook, with my modifications and the addition of my mother's secret
  ingredient, leeks. "Filo" or "fyllo" is the greek word for "leaf."
  
  *  I find that frozen spinach works wonderfully for this recipe.  Also,it's
  cheaper and somewhat easier to prepare.
  
  *  The pie keeps well out of the refrigerator for a few days and can
  (indeed, some claim must) be eaten at room temperature. Because of the way
  the pie is constructed, pieces cut from the corners and sides of the pan
  are particularly crunchy, and a lot of people consider them the best part
  of the pie.  This suits me just fine, because I like the middle pieces
  which have more filling!
  
  *  The original recipe called for twice the amount of olive oil, but I find
  that I don't need that much.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 45 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SPANAKOPITA II
 Categories: Greek, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 lb Spinach, fresh                      7    Eggs
      1 lb Filo dough                          1    Onion, diced
    1/2 lb Feta cheese                    
 
  Dice the onion and saute it until golden brown.
  
  While the onion is cooking, wash the spinach.  Put it in a bowl and rub
  lots of salt into it. Let the spinach/salt sit for 15 minutes. This is
  meant to reduce the volume of spinach. An alternative to this is to barely
  steam the spinach (30-60 seconds).
  
  Beat the eggs.  Crumble the feta cheese and add to the eggs.  Note that
  feta cheese is fairly salty. You can replace half or all of it with ricotta
  cheese.
  
  Rinse all the salt out of the spinach.  Add it and the onions to the
  eggs/cheese and mix.  Also add some spices.  The original recipes calls for
  salt, pepper and oregano.  I use basil.
  
  Melt some butter (at least 2 oz).  Butter the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking
  dish.  Lay the filo down one layer at a time, brushing butter on each
  layer. Turn each successive layer a little so they are not all piled
  directly on top of each other. The filo will hang over the sides of the
  dish.  Continue until you have 3-5 sheets of filo left.
  
  Pour the filling into the filo.  Fold the filo that hangs over the side
  over the filling. Place the last pieces of filo on top, buttering each as
  you go. Trim off the filo that hangs over the edge of the dish. These last
  pieces serve to cover the filling.
  
  Make two or three slits with a knife in the top layers of filo that go all
  the way down to the filling. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 50 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Greek spinach and cheese pie -- This recipe is from the Vegetarian
  Epicure by Anna Thomas. It takes lots of time to make, but is well worth
  it.
  
  *  You can vary the filling to suit your tastes.  We've thought of adding
  mushrooms.
  
  *  My husband complains about how thick and hard to cut the bottom of the
  spanakopita is.  His suggestions (none of which I've tried) include using
  more butter and alternating layers of filo and filling.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  45 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.

  frying-pan,  heat the cooking oil over a high flame.  Add the onions when
  the oil is hot enough to "steam." Reduce the heat to medium and stir
  occasionally.  Fry the onions until they change colour to a deep red/brown.
  This should take 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  At this point add the black mustard seeds and stir a few times.  Then  add
  the ginger, cumin seeds, red chilies and turmeric powder. Increase the heat
  and fry this "masala" for a couple of minutes. Add the marinated lamb to
  the masala and mix well.
  
  At this point you have two options, either to cook the meat on the stove or
  to bake it. Stove-top cooking takes less time but requires fairly constant
  stirring.  It should be cooked in a covered saucepan on a low to medium
  flame for about 45 minutes. Add water if the sauce gets too dry and begins
  to stick. For baking, transfer it to an ovenproof casserole, cover it, and
  bake for 1 1/2 hours at 200 degrees F. Check occasionally, though you are
  unlikely to need to add any water to the sauce.
  
  Finally, prepare and wash the fresh coriander in cold water.  Only the
  leaves and the tender stems should be retained. Chop coarsely and mix well
  just before serving. If you don't have any fresh coriander, then mix in
  about 2-3 t of coriander powder. Serve with well buttered (boiled) rice or
  pita bread and fresh salad.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A popular North Indian lamb dish with coriander -- This is a family
  variation on a popular North Indian dish.  I cook it whenever I could get
  hold of fresh coriander, which in Edinburgh is seldom.
  
  I don't know its authentic Indian name.  We simply call it "dhana lamb" as
  that's how its always cooked at home.  Dhana means "coriander" in Gujarati.
  Yield:  Serves 3-4.
  
  *  Take care not to burn the onions and don't overcook the masala just
  before mixing in the marinated meat.
  
  *  I think the dish tastes a lot better if it is baked.  It's even better
  if cooked for a longer period at a lower temperature.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 day marinating, 2 1/2 hours cooking.

      Title: ORANGE POUND CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 1 cake
 
      1 lb Butter                            1/2 t  Mace
      1 lb Sugar, powdered                   1/4 t  Salt
      2 T  Orange rind, grated               1/4 C  Orange juice
      6 lg Eggs                                1 C  Apricot jam, strained
  3 1/2 C  Flour (all-purpose),                2 T  Orange peel, shredded
           -sifted                        
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream butter until light and fluffy.
  Gradually add sifted sugar and rind.  Cream thoroughly.  Add eggs, one at a
  time, mixing well after each addition.
  
  Sift the flour before measuring, then combine the dry ingredients.
  Gradually add sifted dry ingredients to butter mixture. Add orange juice
  and combine thoroughly.
  
  Turn into buttered and floured 10-inch tube pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F.
  for 50-60 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean and
  cake is golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes. Turn onto wire rack and cool
  thoroughly.  Brush with jam and top with orange peel.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A luscious orange-flavored pound cake -- Absolutely the best cake I have
  ever eaten! I got the recipe from the mother of a friend.  I think  Don's
  mom got the recipe off the back of a sugar box.
  
  *  If you try to make a pound cake with margarine or shortening you  will
  end up with a tasteless mess. Butter is the major taste in a pound cake;
  even if it weren't, butter and margarine have different properties in
  baking, and this recipe is adjusted for butter.
  
  *  Don't make this cake if you don't have an electric mixer or very strong
  wrists.  I figure I spend nearly half an hour beating butter and such when
  I make this cake. Also, this cake is easier to handle if you have a tube
  pan that comes apart into two pieces.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30-40 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: GREEN SHRIMP SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Seafood, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 md Onion                               1 lb Peas (cooked in
      1 lg Carrot (about 5 oz)                      -lightly salted water)
  1 1/2 t  Butter                              5 oz Shrimp (deveined,
      3 C  Meat broth, hot                          -cooked and cut into
      1 T  Savory (fresh,                           -small pieces)
           -chopped fine)                    1/2 C  White wine, dry
      1 t  Tarragon (fresh,                    2 T  Cream
           -chopped fine)                      1 C  Champagne (demi sec)
 
  Chop the onion and carrot finely.  Heat the butter in a pan and fry the
  vegetables for 5 minutes stirring continuously.  Add the hot meat broth.
  Boil for 10 minutes.
  
  Add savory, tarragon and peas.  Bring to a boil and let cook for 8 minutes.
  Strain the soup and put it back into the pan.
  
  Add shrimp.  Simmer 5 minutes on medium heat.  (Be sure the soup is not
  boiling.)  Add white wine and cream.  Take from the heat.  Season if
  necessary.  Add champagne and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fine pea soup with shrimp and champagne -- This is a recipe out of a
  German low-calorie cookbook. It is a simple recipe for a really delicate
  soup. It can be served as a festive appetizer or as a gourmet snack.
  
  *  The fresh spices can be substituted by dried spices.
  
  *  If you use canned shrimp, never let them boil.  They would become tough
  and lose their delicate taste.

      Title: SWEET-POTATO TZIMMES
 Categories: Casseroles, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      4 lg Sweet potatoes,                   1/2 lb Prunes, pitted and
           -peeled and diced                        -halved
      1    Butternut squash,                 1/3 C  Water
           -peeled and diced                 1/3 C  Sugar
      4    Tart apples, peeled,                1 t  Cinnamon, ground
           -cored and diced                  1/2 t  Nutmeg, ground
    1/3 C  Passover wine, sweet, red         1/2 t  Ginger, ground
 
  Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl.  Mix well to distribute the
  liquid evenly.  Dump into a baking dish and seal the baking dish tightly
  with aluminum foil and a lid. Bake 1 hour at 350 F. Cool.
  
  To serve, reheat, then empty into a serving dish.  Don't serve it out of
  the pan you cooked it in (the movement into the serving dish squeezes
  juices out of the fruit).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Vegetable and fruit casserole for Passover -- The original version of
  this recipe came from the "Jewish Holiday Cookbook," by Gloria Kaufer
  Greene. It benefits from being made ahead and then heated for the Seder.

 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Black beans                     1 1/2 C  Onions, finely chopped
    3/4 lb Smoked boneless ham             1 1/2 t  Olive oil
           -hocks (or less)                    1 T  Garlic, finely minced
      8 C  Water                               1 t  Ground cumin
           Salt, to taste                      1 C  Tomatoes, peeled,
      2 C  Beef or chicken broth                    -seeded and diced.
           -(I prefer beef)                  1/4 C  Red wine vinegar
  1 1/2 C  Green bell peppers,                 2 T  Coriander, finely
           -finely chopped, seeded                  -chopped [optional]
           -and cored                                Sherry, dry, to taste
 
  Put the beans, ham hocks, water and salt in a kettle and bring to a boil.
  Cover and let simmer 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until beans are thoroughly
  tender. Remove the ham hocks and set aside.
  
  Drain the beans and reserve both them and the cooking liquid.  There should
  be about 6 cups of beans and about 4 cups of liquid.  Add enough broth to
  the liquid to make about 6 cups.
  
  Put the beans in the container of a food processor or blender, and blend as
  thoroughly as possible.  Add a little of the liquid and continue blending.
  Combine the pureed beans and remaining liquid in a large bowl.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy kettle and add the peppers, onions, garlic and
  cumin. Cook, stirring, until the onions are wilted. Add the tomatoes and
  the vinegar. Let simmer about 15 minutes. Meanwhile cut up ham hocks.
  
  Add the pureed bean mixture to the cooked tomato mixture.  Add the chopped
  ham and coriander. Serve in hot soup bowls with about a tablespoon or so of
  sherry (if desired) in each serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Soup with Black Beans and Ham Hocks -- Here is a hearty soup for those
  cold winter evenings. This is a rather messy soup to make, but well worth
  the effort. Yield: Serves 8-12.
  
  *  I skip the sherry and add a spoon of sour cream or yogurt.  If your
  palate can handle them, try adding pickled jalapeno peppers.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: RED PEPPER SWORDFISH
 Categories: Fish, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Swordfish steaks                    1 C  Olive oil
           -(each about 1/2 lb                 1 t  Salt
           -and about 1 inch thick)          1/2 t  Black pepper,
      1 lg Sweet red pepper                         -fresh ground
      2    Lemons                                   White wine, dry
      3 T  Oregano, fresh                 
 
  Remove seeds and ribs from pepper and cut into 1/4 inch cubes.  Put in a
  bowl and mix well with the juice of the two lemons, the olive oil, salt,
  pepper and the oregano.
  
  Heat broiler and pour wine to a depth of about 1/8 inch in a broiler pan.
  Lay swordfish steaks in wine and broil for 3 minutes. Pour the seasoned
  lemon, oil and oregano mixture over the fish and cook for 3 to 4 minutes
  more (until fish is cooked through and lightly browned.) Immediately
  transfer fish to a warmed serving dish.
  
  You may need to reduce the sauce slightly by boiling vigorously and
  stirring for 2 minutes more. Pour sauce over fish and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Swordfish steaks cooked with sweet red peppers -- This recipe was handed
  out to people buying swordfish at my local fishmonger; I tried it and it
  was delicious. It is also very quick and simple to make.
  
  *  I served fresh asparagus with this, but any light vegetable would be
  fine. Boiled new potatoes would be nice, too.

      Title: SIMPLE MARINADE
 Categories: Condiments, Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1 T  Soy sauce (dark)                    1 t  Oil
      1 T  Brown sugar                         1    Garlic clove
 
  Crush the garlic and mix all ingredients together.  Add meat (steak) and
  leave for at least 1 hour, the longer the better.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple and quite superb meat marinade -- This is a truly wonderful
  marinade.  Just take the steak out of the freezer in the morning before you
  go to work and pop it in the marinade. Yield: 1 serving .
  
  *  The recipe calls for 1 clove of garlic, but we often use 2 or more.  Be
  careful with the Soy Sauce, if it is too salty the marinade is not so good.
  This basic mixture can be varied infinitely; particularly, you can use more
  marinade than this for one piece of meat.  I like to use sesame oil, or
  mustard oil for a little "bite" instead of a bland vegetable oil.

      Title: PIZZA DOUGH
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      5 C  Flour                               2 t  Salt
      2 pk Yeast (dry), active                 2 C  Water
      2 T  Sugar                          
 
  Mix all of the dry ingredients first, then add the water.  It will appear
  to be too dry. Do not add water. Keep working the dough until it is smooth.
  (This requires a little faith but it really works).  Let the dough rise
  once (approx 1 hour). Punch it down and knead again.
  
  At this point you may choose to freeze some of the dough.  If you do freeze
  it, be sure to wrap it well and freeze it quickly.  With either fresh or
  thawed dough, let the dough rise a second time.
  
  After it has risen, punch it down and use it for your pizza.  The dough
  will rise a little while you put the rest of your pizza toppings on it.
  Then bake as appropriate for pizza thickness and toppings.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple pizza dough -- I don't remember where I learned this simple
  recipe for pizza dough. It makes enough dough for two 12 x 18 pan pizzas. I
  like it because it is so easy to memorize and it makes good pizzas. Of
  course, it is not quite as easy to memorize in its metric rendering. Yield:
  2 pizza crusts.
  
  *  I have tried variations like whole wheat, and just about any flour
  combination that works for bread works for pizza dough.

      Title: PIZZA RUSTICA
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 12 servings
 
-------------------------------CHEESE FILLING-------------------------------
      2 lb Ricotta cheese                  1 1/2 t  Mint leaves, dried
      3 lg Eggs                                     -(do not use peppermint)
    1/4 lb Mozzarella cheese,                1/2 t  Black pepper
           -shredded or chopped                     Salt to taste (depends
      6 T  Romano cheese, grated                    -on salt content of
      6 T  Parsley (fresh),                         -cheeses)
           -chopped

--------------------------------MEAT FILLING--------------------------------
      1 lb Italian sausage                          -thinly sliced
           -("mild" or "sweet")                2 oz Prosciutto, thinly
      2 oz Italian dry salami,                      -sliced (or any other ham)

-----------------------------------PIZZA-----------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Pizza dough (if you                      Flour
           -make your own dough,               1    Egg, separated
           -use about 3 C of flour)       
 
  Put ricotta and eggs into a large bowl and stir until well mixed.  Blend in
  all other ingredients.
  
  Slice the sausage into rounds about 3/8 inch thick.  Brown in a little oil
  until cooked through.  Drain and discard grease.  Cut the salami and ham
  slices into strips about 1 x 1/4 inches.
  
  Make or thaw or unwrap the pizza dough.
  
  Mix the meats into the cheese filling.  Roll the dough into two disks, one
  large enough to line a 10-inch round cake pan, the other large enough to
  cover it. Put the larger piece into the lightly-floured cake pan, molding
  it so that it completely lines the pan, with at least 1/2 inch hanging over
  the edge.
  
  Fill with the cheese-meat mixture.  To allow for expansion, fill to about
  1/2 inch below the top of the pan. Wet the exposed dough edge with egg
  white, place the other piece of dough on top, and pinch the two pieces
  together. Trim neatly to make a seal. Brush egg yolk over the top of the
  pie (this will brown during baking). Puncture the top of pie in several
  places with a knife (make sure the holes are large enough not to close up
  during baking). Bake at 350 degrees F. for about an hour, until the top is
  browned but not burned. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack. Serve at
  room temperature.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  San Felese Easter pie -- This dish is traditional in my family at Easter
  time.  I don't know how to spell the Italian name of this pie, but it
  sounds something like "Pizza Gain" (my father translates it as "full pie"
  This recipe originated in the town of San Fele, east of Naples.
  
  *  This recipe makes a very large pie.  I couldn't find a big enough cake
  pan, so I used a cast-iron frying pan. You might try using half the
  quantity of ingredients in a 7-inch pan (make a little extra dough).
  
  *  If possible, grate your own romano cheese.  Some of the romano sold
  pre-grated in cardboard cylinders looks and tastes more like sawdust than
  cheese.  "Romano" and "parmesan" are American names; the main difference is
  that romano is sharper.  The mint you want to use is spearmint.  It is sold
  as just plain "mint" in the spice section of supermarkets. Peppermint is
  entirely the wrong flavor.
  
  *  Italian sausage is a 'fresh' sausage, i.e. uncured and uncooked.  It
  must be cooked before eating. Depending upon where you live, the less-spicy
  version of it is called either "sweet" or "mild."  When I'm really
  ambitious I make my own (that doesn't happen often!). The only ingredients
  are pork (about 20 percent fat), fennel seeds, salt and a small amount of
  red pepper flakes, all coarsely ground and stuffed into natural hog
  casings.  If you can't find Italian sausage, you might try a mixture of
  ground pork with the above seasonings, rolled into little patties. To
  adjust seasonings, just pan-fry a little bit of the mixture and taste.
  
  *  The cheese filling given above (without the meats) is my standard
  filling for lasagna, manicotti, ravioli, etc.
  
  *  This same recipe can be used to make calzone.  Roll out a small disk of
  pizza dough, put a blob of cheese/meat mixture in the middle, fold it over,
  seal and bake.  This is a good way to use up any filling that doesn't fit
  into the pie.

      Title: KERRY'S MEAT PIE
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
    1/4 lb Butter                            3/4 C  Flour, self-raising
    3/4 C  Flour, white                             Water, ice cold

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 lb Lamb or beef                      1/2 lb Mushrooms
           -(pre-cooked cubes)                 6    Tomatoes
      2 md Brown onions                        1    Capsicum (green pepper),
    1/4 C  Seasoned flour                           -sliced
           -(flour with basil,                 1 C  Bread crumbs
           -oregano and pepper)              1/2 C  Tomato sauce
 
  MAKE PASTRY:  Cut butter and flour with two knives until mixture contains
  particles the size of small peas.  Sprinkle with cold water until pastry
  clings together.  Shape into ball and place in refrigerator for 1/2 hour.
  
  Roll out to cover pie dish (about 8 inch).  Leave enough pastry for a top.
  Pre-bake the pie shell for 10 minutes at 350 degrees F.  To prevent crust
  walls from collapsing, fill with dry beans for the first five minutes.
  
  MAKE THE FILLING:  fry onions and meat, continuing until onion is lightly
  browned.  Add flour mix, sliced tomatoes, sliced capsicum, tomato sauce and
  bread crumbs to pan.  Continue until capsicum is softened.  Add mushrooms
  and fry for 1 minute more.
  
  Place the fried mix into the pre-baked pie shell, cover with pastry lid and
  cook in moderate oven for 20 minutes.  Serve hot .

      Title: UPPER MICHIGAN PASTIES
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
      2 C  Flour                             1/4 C  Scraped suet
    1/2 C  Shortening                               Water
    1/4 C  Lard                          

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
  1 1/4 lb Beef, coarsely ground             1/4 C  Rutabaga (swede), diced
      4 md Potatoes, diced                     1    Carrot, diced
      1 lg Onion, chopped                           Salt and pepper
 
  Put the flour in a bowl and cut in the shortening, lard and suet.  Add just
  enough water to make a soft dough.  Divide the dough into four parts and
  roll out each piece into a circle about the size of a dinner plate.
  
  Crumble the meat into a bowl and stir in the potatoes, onion, rutabaga and
  carrot.  Divide the mixture into four parts, putting some on one side of
  each piece of dough. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.
  
  Fold the pastry over the filling to make half-moon shaped pies.  Seal the
  edges and cut a couple of small slits on the top.  Bake on a cookie sheet
  at 375 degrees F. for 30 to 35 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F.
  and bake 15 more minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cornish-style meat pies from the UP -- The pasty (PAH-stee) is a kind of
  English meat pie.  It was brought to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan by
  Cornish miners in the mid-nineteenth century.  The UP version differs
  slightly from the original Cornish pasty in that it has more vegetables and
  less meat and crust.
  
  You can eat pasties hot, warm, or cold.  If you wrap them in aluminum foil
  when they come out of the oven, they'll keep warm for hours.  Or, you can
  refrigerate/freeze them and reheat them later.  (Maybe the original "fast
  food?")
  
  *  Most people who live in the UP don't bother to make their own pasties;
  they buy them from bakeries and pasty shops (which are as common as
  hamburger joints are in other parts of the country). As a former resident,
  though, sometimes I get homesick and resort to making them myself. This is
  the recipe my mother sent me.
  
  *  These have a high cholesterol content.  I've tried using an ordinary
  vegetable-shortening pie crust, but it invariably turns out too dry and
  crumbly to hold together.  (Authentic UP pasties have a crust that's thin,
  moist, and somewhat chewy, not a flaky crust.)  If anyone has any ideas,
  I'd love to hear about them. You can also cook the filling by itself in a
  casserole dish if you're feeling lazy about making the crust.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the crust ingredients.

      Title: BROCCOLI BISQUE
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  1 1/4 lb Broccoli (fresh),                   1 t  Salt
           -trimmed and cut up                 2 t  Curry powder (or less)
           -(okay to use more)                 1 ds Pepper
      4 C  Chicken broth                       2 T  Lime juice
           -(2 cans of canned broth,           8    Lemon slices, (optional)
           -or use fresh stock)              1/2 C  Sour cream
      1 md Onion                               1 T  Chives, snipped
      2 T  Butter                                   -(optional)
 
  Place the cut broccoli in a large saucepan along with the broth, onion,
  butter, salt, curry powder and pepper.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and
  simmer, covered, for 8 to 12 minutes or until broccoli is just tender.
  
  Place about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of the mixture at a time into a blender
  container. Cover and blend until smooth. Pour into bowl or another large
  pan.  Repeat with remaining mixture. BE CAREFUL. THE HOT LIQUID MAY SCALD
  YOU.  Stir in the lime juice.
  
  Now you can either cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours to serve cold
  (great in warm weather), or you can go right ahead and serve it hot (great
  in cold weather). Once ladled out, you can garnish with a thin slice of
  lemon, a small dollop or sour cream, and a sprinkling of chives.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A broccoli soup (hot or cold) -- This recipe is from my mom.  It's been
  a hit every time she or I have served it. It is rather spicy - not for the
  timid or faint-of-heart.
  
  *  You can refrigerate unused portions for serving later, but it doesn't
  keep well for long. I like to blend it pretty well, so that the texture is
  quite smooth. Some people like it a little chunkier.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes.

      Title: YAM CURRY
 Categories: Entrees, Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Yams, tender                        1 t  Turmeric
      2 T  Salt (or less)                    1/2 t  Chili powder
      3 C  Vegetable oil                            -(or use cayenne pepper)
           -for deep frying                    1 t  Coriander, ground
           Ginger root, fresh                1/2 t  Garam masala
           -(2 inches)                              -(optional)
      1    Garlic clove                             Salt to taste
      2 T  Vegetable oil                       4 oz Tomatoes, fresh
           -(up to 3 T)                             -(or use about 8 oz
      1 t  Cumin seeds                              -canned tomatoes)
      2    Green cardamoms                     4 T  Yogurt
      1    Bay leaf                        1 1/2 C  Water
      4    Peppercorns                         1 T  Coriander leaves,
           Cinnamon                                 -chopped (cilantro)
           -(1 inch stick)                
 
  Peel the yams, cut them into 1-inch cubes, place in a colander and sprinkle
  liberally with salt.  Let stand 10-15 minutes, then dry on paper towels.
  
  Meanwhile, finely chop the onion, ginger and garlic, and roughly chop the
  tomatoes.  Heat the oil over a moderate flame, add the cumin seed, and cook
  until they begin to  splutter.  Add the chopped onion, ginger and garlic.
  Cook until the onion is a rich golden color.  Add all the spices and season
  with salt to taste.  Cook a few seconds more and then add the tomatoes. Let
  this cook while you continue as below.
  
  Heat the oil for deep frying to 350 degrees F. and cook the yam cubes, a
  few at a time, until golden brown. Drain on absorbent kitchen paper. Set
  aside.
  
  Add the yogurt to the tomato mixture and continue to cook until the oil
  begins to separate out. Add the water and bring to a boil. Let boil a few
  minutes, then add the yam cubes, reduce heat and simmer, covered, for about
  25 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with the chopped coriander.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Yams in yogurt and spices, good lamb curry substitute -- The yams in
  this dish are cooked in a sauce very much like that traditionally used for
  meat. Serve with chapatis and rice. The recipe is derived from one in "The
  Hamlyn Curry Cookbook," by Meera Taneja, which I recommend highly.

      Title: ANDY BEALS' CHILI
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 12 cups
 
      5 C  Beans, canned (drained)             2    Green bell peppers, diced
      6 C  Tomatoes, stewed                    2 md Onions, diced (or less)
      2 lb Beef, cut into bite-sized                Beer, flavorful (1 bottle)
           -pieces and browned                 2 T  Cumin
           -(don't use ground beef)            2 t  Paprika
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped              1 t  Cayenne pepper
      3 md Jalapeno peppers, cut up       
 
  Saute the meat and onions.  You may do it in the same pan that you are
  going to put the chili in. The meat should be brown on the outside, but you
  don't have to cook it much at this time. Drain the fat from the beef.
  
  Put everything in a big pot over low heat (a slow cooker is handy) and stir
  together.  Wait half an hour to an hour and check the flavor of the soupy
  base.  Adjust as you see fit.  Perhaps add more beer, hot peppers, or
  spices. Repeat as necessary. Wait as long as you can, stirring
  occasionally.  You may eat it when the beans and beef are soft. Serve with
  bread, fresh-baked biscuits or cornbread.
  
  This is best if it has cooked at least overnight.  Generally it's ready for
  consumption after about three hours.  If you can't turn your stove down to
  a very low heat, you're bound to burn the bottom of the chili a little, but
  as long as you don't scrape it off, it will taste okay. Slow-cookers are
  great in this regard!
  
  At the three hour mark, the chili is somewhat soupy.  If you want it to
  thicken up, turn up the heat a bit and let it boil off the excess water.
  While doing this, stir every few minutes or you may burn the bottom!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Andy's own recipe for meat/bean chili -- This is the descendant of the
  chili that I've been making since 1974.
  
  *  I change the proportions of ingredients (double the beef, drop the
  beans, add LOTS more cumin) all the time; this recipe is just a general
  guideline. The amount of garlic given in the recipe is very conservative.
  Garbanzo beans (chick peas) are nice, but they take a lot longer to cook.
  Making it with lamb or Italian sausage instead of beef is also interesting.
  Cherry peppers instead of jalapeno peppers are very nice also.
  
  *  Do not use wimpy American beer!  I have found that Moosehead adds a good
  flavor, and I bet that Anchor Steam will too.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.

      Title: COLE SLAW
 Categories: Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Cabbage                             1 T  Lemon juice
      1 C  Mayonnaise                        1/2 t  Black pepper
    1/2 C  Onion, diced very fine         
 
  Cut the core out of the cabbage and cut it into pieces.  My mother likes to
  cut it into big pieces; I like to cut it into little pieces.  I think she
  wants to make certain that nobody will accuse her of having used a food
  processor.
  
  Mix the pepper and lemon juice and onion in with the cabbage.  Add the
  mayonnaise, mix well and refrigerate.
  
  Vary the amount of mayonnaise according to how much you are worried about
  calories.  Vary the amount of onion if you do or don't like raw onion.
  
  When I make coleslaw for my mother or sister, I leave out the onion and the
  black pepper, and put in about 1 T of sugar.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Coleslaw in many variations -- My family loves to eat coleslaw.
  Unfortunately, we can never agree on the recipe.  If I am making a slaw
  that my mother or sister will eat, I try to make a certain recipe with
  mayonnaise and lemon juice; if I make it for my lunch or for a picnic, I
  make an entirely different recipe loaded with onions and herbs. Craig
  Claiborne likes to put caraway seeds in coleslaw. Betty Crocker suggests
  pineapple and marshmallows.
  
  "The Joy of Cooking" wants you to dress the slaw immediately before
  serving, while Betty Crocker and Spice Islands want you to refrigerate for
  several hours. The only rule seems to be to use fresh cabbage.
  
  *  When I make slaw for a picnic or barbecue or someplace where subtlety
  will not be rampant, I add about 1/2 t of dry mustard, about 2 t of
  paprika, and about 1/2 t of celery or caraway seed. If I'm trying to
  astonish somebody, I will add nuts, cheese, tarragon, whipping cream,
  chives, whole grapes, frozen peas, Tabasco sauce, coriander seed, diced
  apples, or other herbs or textural-contrast ingredients. I have not yet had
  the nerve to try the Betty Crocker suggestion of omitting the onion and
  then adding about 1/2 lb of chopped pineapple and about 1/2 cup of
  miniature marshmallows.

      Title: CABBAGE KOBENHAVEN CASSEROLE
 Categories: Casseroles, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Beef, ground                      1/8 t  Cinnamon
      1 md Onion                             1/8 t  Ground cloves
      1    Garlic clove, minced              1/4 t  Thyme
      1 t  Salt                              1/4 t  Basil
     15 oz Tomato sauce                        4 C  Cabbage, shredded
 
  Brown the ground beef in a large skillet with the onions and garlic, drain
  off the fat. Add the remaining ingredients except cabbage to the meat
  mixture and simmer for 10 minutes.
  
  Put half of the cabbage into a 2-quart casserole dish, top with half of the
  meat mixture, top with the remaining cabbage and finally top the cabbage
  with the remaining meat mixture. (The casserole dish will be rather full,
  but that's OK, it will cook down). Cover the casserole and bake in a
  preheated oven 350 degrees F. for 45 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Danish cabbage and beef casserole.  Yield:  Serves 4-5.
  
  *  I believe that the original of this recipe was lifted from a magazine 5
  or so years ago and sent to me by my mom. I've embellished it somewhat (it
  was a little plain before...)

      Title: CABBAGE AND POTATOES
 Categories: Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      3 lb Cabbage                             6 T  Bacon fat or butter
      2    White potatoes (up to 4,                 -(or less)
           -washed and diced; I like                Splash water or beer
           -the skins left on)                      -(whatever you're
      2    Onions (chopped)                         -drinking)
      1 T  Wine vinegar
 
  Cut the cabbage in half and soak in salted water for 15 minutes.  Agitate
  and drain well. Shred the cabbage.
  
  Heat the bacon fat or butter in a large, heavy skillet and add the diced
  potatoes.  Cook over medium heat until lightly browned.  Add 2 chopped
  onions and cook until transparent, about 5 minutes.
  
  Add cabbage and toss well with two wooden spoons, a la stir-fry.  When the
  cabbage starts to wilt, add salt and freshly-ground black pepper to taste
  and a splash of that beer in your left hand and about 1 T wine vinegar.
  Cover, with lid slightly askew, and simmer over low heat until tender
  (about 30-45 minutes).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cabbage and Potatoes -- With a nod toward Nancy Mintz who reminded me
  how good cabbage can be, especially in the winter time when other fresh
  veggies are scarce. This recipe serves 8, and is good hot or cold.
  
  *  Like Nancy said, one cabbage goes a loooonnnngggg way, so I usually use
  a quarter to a half a head when cooking for 2.

      Title: OMELET ARNOLD BENNETT
 Categories: Breakfast, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      6 lg Eggs (the fresher                   2 oz Cheddar (sharp),
           -the better)                             -finely grated (the
      6 oz Smoked haddock                           -light yellow New York/
           -(or other smoked large-                 -Vermont style is best)
           -flaked white fish)                 1 pn Dill
    2/3 C  Cream, heavy                        1 pn Salt and pepper
           Butter            
 
  Prepare the fish by poaching it lightly (5 minutes) and then breaking it up
  into nice large flakes.
  
  Whip the cream and fold in the grated cheese.  Add the fish and set aside.
  (The remaining steps are a basic omelet recipe and can be used with any
  filling.  Crack the eggs, beat them up with the dill, salt and pepper.)
  
  Meanwhile heat a frying pan.  Add a knob of butter and let it melt.  When
  it has stopped frothing and is just beginning to go brown...
  
  Slop in half the egg mixture and immediately return to the heat and stir
  the eggs two or three times; then with a fork draw the edges into the
  middle and allow the un-solidified egg to run onto the exposed pan.
  
  While it is still a mixture of fluffy and runny, add the haddock and cream
  mixture.  Continue to cook until underside begins to turn golden brown.
  Fold over and serve on a hot plate with bread and butter immediately. (You
  can't leave it in the oven for ten minutes while you do another!)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Omelet with cream and smoked fish filling -- In the vein of artery
  cloggers, this recipe must be one of the highest-cholesterol dishes I've
  come across in years. It may sound unconventional, but delicious it most
  certainly is. I came upon it in the Bistro under the Everyman Theatre in
  Liverpool, circa 1978. The following is my reconstruction of the dish I had
  there.
  
  *  My guess, although I haven't yet tried, is that the smoked haddock could
  be substituted with any large-flaked smoked white fish, like cod perhaps.
  The important point is that it should not have an overpowering flavour. I
  bought mine in a Scottish specialty shop in Kearny, NJ. Also, you should
  grate the cheese as finely as possible so that it blends smoothly with the
  cream.
  
  *  Now a diatribe on omelet pans.  I have always been most successful with
  a small thin tinned-copper omelet pan (which loses its heat and reheats
  very quickly), and a heavy cast iron skillet, which maintains an even hot
  temperature (and doesn't need to be reheated after adding the egg mixture).
  Aluminum and stainless steel pans tend to cool down too much and then take
  too long to reheat which results in a dry leathery omelet. (But, there
  again, you may like 'em like that.)
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes.

      Title: RED CABBAGE WITH APPLES
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      3 lb Red cabbage                         2    Apples, tart, cored
      6 T  Bacon fat or butter                      -and diced (not peeled)
           -(or less)                          2 T  Brown sugar
      1    Onion, finely chopped               1 T  Wine vinegar
      1 C  Red wine, dry                     1/2 t  Caraway seeds
 
  Discard the outer leaves of a firm,  3-lb red cabbage, and cut it in half.
  Shred finely and soak in salted water for 15 minutes.  Drain well.
  
  Heat the bacon fat or butter in a large, heavy skillet and add 1 finely
  chopped onion.  Cook onion until transparent, about 5 minutes, then add
  cabbage.  Toss well with two wooden spoons, as you would a salad.  When
  cabbage starts to wilt, add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste,
  and red wine.
  
  Simmer for 5 minutes and then add 2 tart apples, cored and diced, but not
  peeled.  Sprinkle with brown sugar, and add wine vinegar and caraway seeds.
  Cover, with lid slightly askew, and simmer over low heat for about 45
  minutes. Serves 8 and is good hot or cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A fruity cabbage saute -- I just tried this recipe from a column in the
  local paper.  It's good winter food, very satisfying on a cold nasty day.
  My only caveat is to use a *large* skillet, or halve the recipe. I cooked a
  full batch and had cabbage overflowing onto the stove.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.
  
  : Enjoy!

      Title: FRENCH CABBAGE SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Cabbage, shredded                   1    Garlic clove, chopped
    1/4 lb Bacon                             1/2 C  White-wine tarragon
      2 C  Onion, chopped                           -vinegar
 
  Cut the bacon into tiny bits, fry it in a big deep frying pan, and fish out
  all the bits after they are crisp.  Cut up the onion and garlic and fry
  them in the bacon fat. When they are brown, pour in the vinegar.
  
  Bring it just up to a simmer, add all the cabbage and bacon, toss it as you
  would a salad, and serve it.  The cabbage doesn't cook, but it wilts a
  little under the hot vinegar.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Wilted cabbage salad with bacon -- This is a wonderful thing to do with
  cabbage.  With no garlic, and using cider vinegar, it becomes German
  cabbage salad. Adding sour cream to that makes Danish cabbage salad.
  
  *  Cut the vinegar with a little water if you don't like very sour things,
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes.

      Title: APPLE CRUMB PIE
 Categories: Pies, Usenet
      Yield: 1 pie
 
      4 C  Apples, tart                      1/4 C  Flour, all-purpose
      2 T  Butter                            1/4 C  Butter, melted
    3/4 C  Sugar                             1/2 C  Nuts, chopped
    1/2 t  Nutmeg                                   -(walnuts, pecans, etc.)
      1 t  Cinnamon                            1    Pie crust
    1/2 C  Brown sugar                    
 
  Core, peel and slice the apples.  Melt the butter and mix the rest in with
  it. Pour over apples and mix around so the apples are coated. Put in an
  unbaked pie shell.
  
  Combine brown sugar, flour, melted butter and nuts.  Spread over top of the
  filling.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 50 minutes, or until it is bubbling.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  One-crust apple-crumb pie -- The pie can also be frozen and then baked,
  right from the freezer, at 360 for 90 minutes.  The pies will keep a very
  long time in the freezer and not be worse for wear.
  
  *  PS:  For those who like the quality of home-made pie crusts but the
  convenience of ready-made, make a bunch of crusts someday when the mood
  grabs you, and put them in the freezer in a big plastic bag.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
      6 T  Butter, melted                      3 T  Sugar
      1 t  Cinnamon                            2 C  Graham cracker crumbs

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
     24 oz Cream cheese, at                    3 lg Eggs, at room
           -room temperature                        -temperature
      1 C  Sugar                             1/2 t  Vanilla extract

  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Mix crust ingredients.  Press into
  springform pan on bottom and sides.
  
  Mix filling ingredients and pour into pan.  Make sure all ingredients are
  room temperature. Bake 30-35 minutes, or until slightly browned.
  
  Remove cake from oven and increase oven temperature to 500 degrees F.  Mix
  topping ingredients and gently spread on top of cake.  Return cake to 500
  degree F. oven for five mins.  Remove from oven, cool to room temperature,
  and chill overnight. Serve cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Ultimate cheesecake -- This recipe is the original creation of a
  co-worker, Don Chaney. I consider myself a cheesecake gourmet, and I rate
  this recipe as 8.5 out of 10 (However, there are no 10s). The recipe is so
  simple, I almost feel guilty serving it.
  
  *  Variations: Crush some walnuts into the crust.  Pour a can of cherry or
  blueberry pie filling over the chilled cake, then chill again.  Put about
  2-3 T of your favorite liqueur into the cake filling.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking, overnight cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: MACARONI AND CHEESE
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    3/4 lb Bacon (optional,                         -don't use sourdough
           -but I think this                        -crumbs, either)
           -really makes the dish!)            1 lb Elbow macaroni, uncooked
    1/4 C  Butter (Margarine will              3    Scallions, chopped
           -do in a pinch)                          -(up to 5)
  1 1/2 C  Bread crumbs (unseasoned;       1 1/2 lb Swiss cheese
 
  Cook the bacon until it is very crisp.  When done, blot dry.
  
  Put the butter in a small frying pan and heat at a low temperature until
  it's melted. When melted, add the bread crumbs and saute until the bread
  crumbs are browned, stirring frequently to avoid burning the crumbs.
  
  Boil the macaroni in water according to directions on the package.  Don't
  overcook...  it should be "al dente".  A little olive oil added to the pot
  will help prevent the macaroni from sticking together.  While the macaroni
  is cooking, grate the cheese and chop the scallions.
  
  When the macaroni is done, drain it in a colander.  The "assembly" is done
  in layers into a glass baking dish. Put a layer of macaroni on the bottom,
  then cheese, the crumble bacon and scallions on top of this. Make the
  layers thin; this way, you can get about three pasta/cheese/bacon layers.
  When all of these are in the pan, top with the bread crumbs and bake at 325
  degrees F. for 20 minutes or until the bread crumbs are a little more
  browned and the cheese is melted.
  
  Eat.  However, it makes fantastic leftovers, so you won't want to eat it
  all.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Greatest Macaroni and Cheese in the Universe.
  
  *  Cooking the bacon in the oven or in a microwave works well for this
  recipe. I find the best way to dry the bacon is to put a couple of paper
  towels on top of an old brown paper bag, then the bacon, and then a couple
  more paper towels on top of that, and then just pat with the hand a few
  times.  It's important to get the bacon dry or the casserole will be too
  greasy.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20-30 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking.

      Title: BEEF STOCK
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 quarts
 
      5 lb Soup bones                          3    Yellow onions, unpeeled
      1    Bunch carrots                       5 qt Water
      1    Bunch celery                   
 
  Brown the bones in a heavy pan if there is meat on them.  If there is no
  meat, roast the bones in a 400 F oven for two hours, being careful not to
  burn them.
  
  Chop the carrots, celery and onions.  The onion skin will add to the color
  of the stock.
  
  Place all of the ingredients in a heavy stock pot and simmer for 12 hours.
  Add water as necessary to keep the other ingredients covered.  Alternately,
  bring to a simmer and place, covered, in a 225 F oven overnight.
  
  Strain the stock.  A layer of fat will form on top of the stock as it
  cools. This is a sufficient seal to keep the stock fresh in the
  refrigerator for a couple of weeks. It freezes well, too.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A basic brown soup stock -- This is a similar stock to the one Jeff
  Smith describes in "The Frugal Gourmet." I usually use bones with meat on
  them; he recommends meatless ones.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 12-14 hours cooking.

      Title: SALMON PATTIES
 Categories: Fish, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Salmon, canned                    1/4 C  Bread crumbs,
           -(either pink or red)                    -plain or spiced
      1 pn Salt                                2    Eggs
      1 sm Onion, diced                        1 t  Lemon juice
 
  Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl.  Form into patties about 1/2
  to 3/4 inch thick and 2 1/2 - 3 inches diameter. This should make about 8
  patties.  Fry in oil or butter until brown and crispy, or bake in a
  well-greased pan at 400 degrees until brown (about 15 minutes).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Snack or Main Course -- This is a very nice finger food, great for lunch
  on a hike. Or they can be served hot as a main course.
  
  *  I usually make a double batch.
  
  *  These are great either hot or cold.  If you take them out of the freezer
  in the morning and put them in your backpack, they'll be just right by
  lunchtime.

      Title: SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 1 cake
 
    1/2 C  Shortening                        1/2 pt Sour cream
    3/4 C  Sugar                               6 T  Butter, softened
      1 t  Vanilla                             1 C  Light brown sugar,
      3 lg Eggs                                     -firmly packed
      2 C  Flour, sifted                       2 t  Cinnamon
      1 t  Baking powder                       1 C  Nuts, chopped
      1 t  Baking soda                              -(walnuts or pecans)
 
  Prepare a 10-inch tube pan.  I use one with a removable center.  Grease the
  pan and cut a circle of waxed paper to cover the bottom.  Preheat oven to
  350 degrees.
  
  Cream shortening, sugar and vanilla, thoroughly.  Add eggs, singly, beating
  well after each addition.
  
  Sift flour, baking powder and baking soda together.  Add flour mixture and
  sour cream to creamed mixture.  Alternate a little of each, blending after
  each addition.
  
  In separate bowl, cream butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together.  Add
  nuts and mix well.
  
  Spread 1/2 of the batter in the tube pan.  Sprinkle 1/2 of the nut mixture
  evenly over batter in pan.  Cover with remaining batter.  Sprinkle with
  remaining nut mixture.  Bake in preheated oven for about 50 minutes.
  
  When the cake cools, run a knife around the side of the pan and remove the
  inner section.  Carefully remove the cake from the base of the pan and
  remove the waxed paper.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Coffee cake with cinnamon and sour cream -- I got this recipe from my
  mom. She got it, I think, from my godmother. All of us kids in the family
  make it now. It is an unusual coffee cake, good to have with morning coffee
  or as an evening dessert. Enjoy it. Yield: Fills 10-inch tube pan.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  45 minutes preparation, 50 minutes baking, 10 minutes cooling.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: DELMONICO POTATOES
 Categories: Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     14 md Potatoes                            1 t  Salt
    1/3 C  Rice, white                       1/2 t  Pepper
      6 T  Butter                              2 lb Cheddar cheese,
      6 T  Flour                                    -sharp
      3 C  Milk                           
 
  Boil the potatoes in salted water until they are cooked firm, about 20 or
  30 minutes. Let them cool, then dice them into 1/2-inch cubes.
  
  Cook the rice in 1 C of water with 1/4 t of salt.  Cook until soft, about
  20 minutes. Drain.
  
  Make 3 cups of medium white sauce:  heat the milk in a saucepan; in another
  saucepan, melt butter and brown flour in it.  When flour is brown, dump hot
  milk all at once into flour/butter mixture.  Add salt and pepper, simmer
  for 10 minutes or more, stirring frequently. Into the white sauce, stir 1/2
  pound of grated cheddar and the rice. Mix well.
  
  Mix the sauce with the cold potatoes, then pour into a buttered baking
  dish. Sprinkle generously with 1 1/2 pounds of cheddar. Bake 1 hour at 325
  F.
  
  Let it cool and put it in the refrigerator.  Wait at least a day.  Then
  reheat and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A casserole of potatoes, rice and cheese -- This recipe has been in my
  family for 100 years.  The family legend was that it came from the
  Delmonico Hotel in New York, whose chef, Charles Ranhofer, had given it to
  my great-great grandfather under some circumstance in the 1880's. I
  recently managed to track down a cookbook by Ranhofer, published in 1893,
  and alas, it contains no recipe that even remotely resembles this one.
  
  Who knows? Maybe my great-grandmother got it from a newspaper.  I guess it
  doesn't matter much.  I've watched 4 generations in my family grow fatter
  and happier eating these potatoes, so who cares where it came from `way
  back then.
  
  *  My grandmother always peeled the potatoes when she made this recipe; I
  never do.  I think that women of her generation were taught by their home
  economics teachers that unpeeled potatoes were a sign of moral decay.
  
  *  The most maddening thing about this recipe is how much better it tastes
  the second day. There is no reason why you can't eat it fresh out of the
  oven, but if you can muster the will power to put it aside after it has
  cooked and to let it wait a day, the flavor will improve dramatically.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  1 hour to prepare, 1 hour to cook, 1 day to wait.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: KELLY'S ASIAN CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Frying chicken cut                  3 T  Honey
           -into serving pieces,               1    Garlic bulb, peeled
           -or equivalent in                        -and coarsely chopped
           -chicken parts of                        -(yes that says BULB,
           -your choice                             -the whole head)
      3 T  Peanut oil                          2 sm Red peppers, dried
    3/4 C  Distilled white vinegar                  -(hot -- optional)
    1/4 C  Soy sauce                      
 
  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet and brown chicken on all sides (5-10
  minutes).  Use medium-high heat.
  
  Add garlic and peppers about 1 minute before the end of the browning
  process. Add the remaining ingredients and cook over medium heat until
  chicken is done and sauce has reduced somewhat. This takes about 10
  minutes.
  
  If you are cooking white and dark meat together, remove the white meat
  first or it will dry out. Watch that sauce does not burn or boil away.
  
  Serve with rice, Chinese noodles or pasta.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken with garlic and hot peppers -- Another winner from "The Garlic
  Lover's Cookbook."  Don't let the amount of garlic scare you.
  
  *  When you look in the skillet to see how everything is going and to get a
  whiff of the lovely aroma, do not take a big whiff.  The vinegar will knock
  you out!
  
  *  This recipe won first place at a recent Garlic Cook-off at the Gilroy
  Garlic Festival.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  preparation:  5 minutes, cooking:  20 minutes.

      Title: YOGURT CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Frying chicken                      2 t  Masala seasoning
    1/4 C  Vegetable oil                            -(see note)
      3 md Onions                              2 C  Yogurt, plain
      2    Garlic cloves                     1/4 C  Butter, clarified
      1 t  Cayenne (red pepper)                2 t  Salt (or less
      1 T  Coriander                                -to taste)
           -(or less to taste)            
 
  First prepare the sauce:  Slice or chop the onions.  Using a large heavy
  frying pan that has a lid, saute the onions in the oil.  When they are
  translucent and beginning to brown, add the garlic.  When its moisture
  evaporates, add the cayenne, coriander and masala seasoning.  Lower heat
  and simmer 7 minutes, partly covered. Remove from heat and let it cool a
  bit.
  
  Cut the chicken into chunks.  If you are feeling decadent, then remove the
  bones from the chicken to make this a boneless-chicken dish.
  
  Puree the onion-and-spice mixture in your food processor.  Don't make it
  into baby food, but make sure there are no stringy pieces of onion left in
  it.
  
  Over medium-high heat, heat the clarified butter until it starts to smoke,
  then dump in the  cut-up chicken all at once.  Stir continuously for 2
  minutes, then saute for 3 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Add the onion-and-spice pure to the cooking chicken.  Add salt.  Stir the
  mixture until it starts to bubble, then lower heat, cover and simmer for 30
  minutes.  Let cool until ready to serve.  The longer you wait, the better
  it will taste, up to a day or two.
  
  Cook some rice to go with it.  Reheat over low heat and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An Indian-style chicken dish with yogurt and red pepper -- This
  fail-safe recipe yields a delicious Indian-style chicken dish. Serve it
  with rice and you have a meal. It makes wonderful leftovers, in fact, it
  tastes much better as leftovers than it does when cooked fresh.
  
  *  Masala seasoning is an Indian "general-purpose" seasoning.  Serious
  Indian cooks make their own, and no two are quite the same. The word masala
  means something like "blend of spices." Since this dish isn't trying to be
  authentically Indian, you can use most any store-bought mixture that you
  like, including "Tandoori" mixtures, "curry powders," etc. If you want to
  make your own, try some mixture of cardamom seeds, cinnamon, cloves,
  pepper, cumin and coriander, suitably mixed and ground.
  
  *  If you don't want to use clarified butter, you can use any cooking oil.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  1/2 hour preparation, 1/2 hour cooking, 1-24 hours sitting.
  : Precision:  No need to measure, but be respectful of cayenne.

      Title: MICRONESIAN CHICKEN
 Categories: Barbecue, Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4    Chicken breasts                    12 oz Beer
           -(leave bones and                   4 oz Soy sauce
           -skin intact)                       1    Garlic clove,
      3    Lemons                                   -mashed or chopped
      1 md Onion, chopped                 
 
  Squeeze the juice of the lemons over the chicken and let stand while
  preparing the rest of the marinade.
  
  In a large bowl, combine the beer, soy sauce, chopped onion and chopped
  garlic.  Drain the lemon juice from above into this mixture.
  
  Put the chicken in the marinade, cover and refrigerate for 3 hours minimum.
  It's better to marinate overnight.  Make sure chicken is covered by
  marinade.
  
  Over an OPEN outdoor grill (gas or charcoal), cook the chicken for about 40
  minutes turning every 10 minutes or so.  Each time the chicken is turned,
  re- dip the pieces in the marinade.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Easy marinated chicken for outdoor BBQ -- This recipe was obtained from
  a friend of a friend several years ago. It has been a hit every time and is
  guaranteed to have your downwind neighbors salivating at your doorstep.
  Yield:  serves 2-4.
  
  *  More chicken may be added to this recipe; the only limiting factor is
  that the chicken be covered with the marinade while in the refrigerator.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes to prepare marinade, overnight in refrigerator, 40
  minutes to cook.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: SIMPLE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES
 Categories: Candy, Usenet
      Yield: 2 dozen
 
      4 C  Powdered sugar                      1 t  Vanilla extract
           -(yes, four cups!)                  5 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      8 oz Cream cheese (one                        Assorted toppings
           -large package or                        -(cocoa, powdered sugar,
           -3 small packages                        -crushed nuts, jimmies,
           -less a nibble)                          -etc.)
 
  Mix the powdered sugar into the softened cream cheese a little (2/3 cup) at
  a time, making sure it is well blended after every addition.
  
  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler and add it to the cream cheese
  mixture along with the vanilla. Mix well. Chill for a couple hours. Roll
  mix into one inch balls, then roll them in a topping. Chill.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Easy-to-make candies with chocolate and cream cheese -- Here's a good
  recipe for lazy chocolate freaks.  They're not as good as the ones you buy
  in good candy stores, but they're still yummy.
  
  *  If you're adventurous, try substituting the liqueur of your choice for
  the vanilla.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling, 20 minutes rolling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: EASY REFRIGERATOR ROLLS
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 2 dozen
 
  6 1/4 C  Flour, all-purpose              1 1/2 C  Water
    1/2 C  Sugar                             1/4 C  Butter
      2 t  Salt                                1    Egg
      2 T  Yeast, dry (each                         Vegetable shortening
           -pk is about 1 T)                        -or more butter
    1/2 C  Milk                           
 
  Combine 2 cups of flour, sugar, salt and undissolved yeast.
  
  Heat milk, water and butter until liquids are very warm (120-130 degrees
  F.). Add to dry ingredients. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed (I've never
  used an electric mixer, by the way. Just stir until things are evenly
  combined and not terribly lumpy.) Add egg and about 1 cup flour. Beat at
  high speed 2 minutes. Add enough additional flour to make a soft dough.
  This is where the arm muscles get their exercise!
  
  Grease top of dough (with butter or vegetable shortening).  Cover the bowl
  and refrigerate it overnight.
  
  Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces.  Shape them into balls and place
  each in a greased muffin cup. Cover; let rise in a warm place (75-100
  degrees F.) until doubled. This will take between 1 and 1 1/2 hours.
  Towards the end of the rising period, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
  Bake at 400 degrees F. for 12 to 15 minutes. Store the rolls tightly
  covered, that is, if there are any left.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An utterly reliable recipe for yeast rolls -- I believe this recipe
  started its life on the back of a Fleischman's Yeast package, but it has
  been memorized and modified for about ten years now. It is the most
  reliable yeast recipe I've ever seen: it's never failed on me, and it
  always does an amazing amount of rising (my family calls them mushroom
  rolls).
  
  *  This is the first really good yeast bread recipe I discovered when I
  started making bread in the sixth grade.  Done carefully, it can approach a
  delicate, cake-like texture.  It doesn't have to be shaped into rolls, of
  course -- try it in a regular bread pan, or in fancy shapes.
  
  *  I use Fleischman's dry yeast.  I suppose cake yeast can be used, but it
  always seemed like a nuisance to me.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  1 hour of work spread over 2 days.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: FROZEN CHRISTMAS PLUM PUDDING
 Categories: Puddings, Christmas, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      4 C  Dried fruits (mixed),               2 t  Gelatine
           -finely chopped                     1 T  Water, boiling
      1 t  Orange rind, grated                 1 ga Ice cream, vanilla,
      2 T  Cocoa                                    -slightly softened,
    1/2 C  Brandy or masala                         -but not melted
 
  Combine fruit, spice, orange rind, cocoa and brandy in a large saucepan.
  Over medium heat, bring almost to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cool,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  Mix gelatine and boiling water; simmer in a small pan for a few seconds,
  until evenly melted. Blend into fruit, chill. Fold the fruit into the
  softened ice cream, blending evenly. Pack into foil lined bowl, cover with
  foil and freeze overnight or longer.
  
  To serve,  unmould onto a serving plate, cut into wedges and serve with
  cinnamon-flavoured whipped cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A southern-hemisphere Christmas plum pudding -- We here in the Southern
  Hemisphere have a summer Christmas so we have adapted some of the more
  traditional festive fare to local conditions.  Here is one example.  It is
  very easy, and it can be made up to a week ahead of using.  Yield:  Serves
  8-10.
  
  *  The original recipe called for the use of a microwave to do the heating
  and cooking. This works well for melting the gelatine but is a bit of a
  nuisance otherwise.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate (timing matters).
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, overnight freezing.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

    1/2 oz Yeast (dry), active                 2 T  Butter
           -(two standard envelopes)          10 oz Poppy seeds,
    1/2 C  Water, warm                              -coarsely ground
  4 1/2 C  Flour, all-purpose                  2 T  Honey
    3/4 C  Sugar                               2 t  Lemon juice
    1/2 t  Salt                                2    Egg whites

      2    Eggs                              1/4 C  Candied orange peel,
      2    Egg yolks (save                          -chopped fine
           -whites for the filling)          1/4 C  Raisins, steamed
    1/2 C  Sour cream                               -(steamed, or soaked in
      1 t  Vanilla                                  -hot water, until soft)
           POPPY SEED FILLING                  2 t  Lemon peel, grated

-----------------------------------ICING-----------------------------------
      1 C  Sugar, powdered                     2 T  Lemon juice
 
  MAKE THE DOUGH:  Soften the yeast in warm water in a bowl.  Mix flour with
  sugar and salt.  Cut in the butter until mixture has a fine, even crumb.
  
  Beat eggs and extra yolks; mix with yeast, then stir into the flour
  mixture. Add the sour cream and the vanilla and mix well.
  
  Knead dough on floured surface for 5 minutes.  Divide in half and roll each
  half into a 12 inch square.  Cover.
  
  MAKE THE FILLING:  Melt butter in a large pan.  Add poppy seed and stir-fry
  for 3 minutes.  Add honey, lemon juice and raisins to poppy seeds.  Cover
  and remove from heat. Let stand for 10 minutes.
  
  Beat egg whites with sugar until stiff moist peaks form.  Fold in orange
  and lemon peels and then gently fold in poppy seed mixture.
  
  Spread half of the filling on each dough square (after you uncover them).
  Roll up as you would for a jelly-roll and seal the edges.  Place on greased
  baking sheets and cover.  Let rise until doubled in bulk (approx. 1 1/2
  hours).
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Bake about 45 minutes, then remove from
  oven and cool.
  
  MAKE THE ICING:  Mix powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth.  Spread
  this mixture evenly over the rolls.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Poppy seed rolls -- This recipe could be used as part of a 12-course
  meal known in Polish as Wigilia, or on its own. Wigilia is eaten after
  sundown on Christmas Eve. Yield: Makes 2 rolls.
  
  *  You can grind poppy seeds in a mortar and pestle.  Specialty food stores
  sell grinders specifically designed for poppy seeds.  Some spice shops sell
  poppy seeds already ground, but like all spices they lose their freshness
  much more rapidly after they are ground. This year (1987) in Poland, the
  people are having a very hard time finding enough poppy seeds for their
  strucle z makiem because there is a government crackdown on the growing of
  all poppies in an attempt to control opium production.

      1 oz Mushrooms, dried                1 1/2 lb Sauerkraut, rinsed

------------------------------------FISH------------------------------------
      2    Carrots                             2 t  Salt
      2    Celery stalks                       6 C  Water
      1    Parsley root                        2 lb Fish fillets
      1    Onion, quartered                         -(carp, sole, pike
      5    Peppercorns                              -or similar fillets)

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      3 T  Butter                            1/4 t  Salt
      3 T  Flour                             2/3 C  Sour cream
    3/4 C  Horseradish, prepared,              2    Eggs, hard-cooked,
           -cream-style                             -peeled and sieved
      1 t  Sugar                          
 
  Combine vegetables, dry seasonings and water in a saucepan or pot.  Bring
  to a boil; simmer 20 minutes, then strain.
  
  Cook fish in the strained vegetable stock 6 to 10 minutes, or until fish
  flakes easily.  Remove fish from stock.  Arrange on serving platter and
  cover with plastic wrap. Chill. Strain fish stock and reserve 3/4 cup for
  horseradish sauce; cool.
  
  For horseradish sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan, then blend in flour
  until smooth, making what the French would call a roux.  Add the cooked
  fish stock gradually, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until the sauce
  boils and becomes thick and smooth.
  
  Remove from heat and stir in horseradish, sugar, salt, sour cream and eggs.
  Cool for 15 minutes.  Pour the horseradish sauce over the chilled fish and
  garnish with shredded lettuce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fish in horseradish sauce -- This recipe is the first of the 12 dishes
  that make up the traditional Polish Christmas-eve meal, which is eaten
  after sundown on Christmas eve. The Polish word for Christmas eve is
  Wigilia (pronounced VI-gee-lee-ah). Its root is like the English vigil:
  waiting for Christ to be born. At the end of the Wigilia meal the family
  goes off to midnight mass at church.
  
  There are usually 12 dishes in a Wigilia meal to symbolize the 12 apostles,
  though some families serve 13 because they include Christ in their count.
  The meal starts when the first star can be seen; this symbolizes the star
  of Bethlehem. Although The Wigilia is meatless (Advent, the season of
  penance, continues until midnight), it is still festive and delicious. The
  tradition of Wigilia, though centuries old, is still current in Poland.
  There is no fixed set of rules for what the 12 (or 13) dishes must be; the
  items in the meal change somewhat according to location and availability of
  ingredients.
  
  Nevertheless, all of the dishes are traditional, and in addition there are
  many traditions for the serving of the meal.  For example, some people
  place straw under the tablecloth to symbolize the manger in which Christ
  was born. Most families set an extra place, for the stranger who might be
  passing by. This is my family's traditional Wigilia meal:
  
  : Fish in horseradish sauce
  : Pike Polish style
  : Pickled beets
  : Pickled herring in sour cream
  : Stewed sauerkraut with mushrooms
  : Christmas eve kutia
  : Almond soup
  : Noodles with poppy seed and raisins
  : Poppy-seed rolls
  : Christmas bread
  : Baked apples with red wine
  : Marzipan
  : 12-fruit compote
  
  With this first recipe you will notice a similarity with my last name.  Now
  you know a word of Polish (namely chrzan = horseradish i.e. hot stuff).
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.  Experiment.

      Title: STEAMED TURNIP CAKE
 Categories: Vegetables, Chinese, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1 lb Corn starch                       1/2 t  Sugar
      3 C  Water, cold                         2 C  Chicken broth
      6 lb Turnips,                                 -(or use water
           -peeled and grated                       -and bouillon cubes)
     10 oz Cantonese sausage                 1/2 C  Water
           -(about 8 sausages)                 1 T  Cooking wine
    1/2 C  Chinese dried shrimps               1 T  Sugar
      6 T  Cooking oil                     1 1/2 t  Salt
      1 t  Soy sauce                           1 t  Ground pepper
 
  Soak dried shrimps in lukewarm water until softened, drain.  Mix well the
  corn starch with about 3 cups of cold water, by hand.
  
  Dice the sausages.  Heat about 2 T of oil in a pan and stir fry the
  sausages and dried shrimps for about 7 mins. Add the soy sauce, cooking
  wine and about 1/2 t sugar. Stir fry for 1 more minute, remove from heat,
  and set aside.
  
  In a large stock pot, heat up about 4 T of oil, the chicken broth, about
  1/2 cup of water, about 1 T sugar, salt and ground pepper. Add the grated
  turnip and mix well. Cook, covered, over high heat for about 15 minutes.
  
  Grease four 9-inch round cake pans with some shortening.
  
  Add sausages to the cooked turnip mixture and mix well.  Then add the
  cornstarch mixture and stir quickly over low heat until it looks
  transparent, about 7 minutes.
  
  Place cake mixture in greased pans and steam over high heat for 1 hour and
  20 mins.
  
  Let the cakes cool completely before cutting.  Cooled cakes  can be easily
  taken out of pans upside down.  Turnip cakes taste better when served warm
  and topped with soy sauce and a little bit of chili sauce. Or they can be
  cut up into thin slices and pan fried slightly with oil before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An easy recipe for Cantonese salty turnip cakes -- We usually make this
  cake in winter time.  I got this recipe originally from  a magazine in Hong
  Kong.  It is a new and easy way to make this Cantonese specialty.  I have
  tried this recipe on about ten Americans.  They all like it.
  
  *  If you don't have a steamer, a 16 quart stock pot can be a very good
  steamer.  Any casseroles that can fit in your steamer can be used instead
  of cake pans.
  
  *  Cantonese sausages are usually made with pork cubes.  They are made by
  dehydrating the sausages with cold air and are usually available in the
  winter time. The diameter is about the same as American breakfast sausages
  but is about 5 to 6 inches long. The sausages have to be cut into very fine
  cubes so that they mix well with the turnips. The cake tastes good partly
  because of the flavor of the sausages. I have never tried anything else.
  But I think bacon bits might be able to mix well with the turnip mixture.
  Of course, the cake will taste different with bacon bits.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 2 hours cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  hearty winter soup, suitable as a main course, especially when served with
  fresh bread or biscuits.

      Title: VEGETABLE-STUFFED TROUT
 Categories: Fish, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    Trout, about                      1/2    Onion
           -1/2 pound each                          Assorted seasonings
      1 T  Margarine                                -(salt, pepper,
      2 T  Lemon juice                              -bay leaf, basil,
      1    Green pepper                             -dried parsley, etc.)
 
  Clean and scale the trout.  Wash carefully.  You can leave the heads on if
  you like.
  
  Cut up the green pepper and onion into bite-size chunks.  If you're feeling
  experimental, try adding a bit of tomato (or whatever).
  
  Melt the margarine in a microwaveable dish big enough to accommodate the
  fish. Stir in the lemon juice. Roll the fish around in the lemon-butter
  mixture and sprinkle with seasonings to taste. Add the vegetables to the
  dish (don't put them in the trout yet).
  
  Cover loosely to prevent spatters (a paper plate or wax paper works fine)
  and microwave on high power for about 7 minutes, or until the fish is
  opaque and flaky and the vegetables are tender. Flip the fish over and stir
  the vegetables once or twice during this time. Scoop some of the vegetables
  and sauce into the body cavity before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Stuffed trout cooked in a microwave oven -- I prefer fish cooked in the
  microwave to ordinary baked fish, because it doesn't get dried out.  The
  texture is similar to what you get when you cook fish wrapped in aluminum
  foil outdoors over a wood fire. It's also much less work!
  
  *  This recipe is for a standard 600 to 700 watt microwave oven.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you know how to clean a trout.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      1    Green bell pepper                 1/2 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -(capsicum), chopped                     -grated
      1 T  Chili powder                      1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese,
      1 t  Cumin                                    -grated
      3    Cilantro sprigs                     1 C  Corn chips, crushed
           -(up to 6)                     
 
  Brown ground chuck; drain any excess fat.  Add (chopped) onion, garlic and
  bell pepper; cook until soft.
  
  Cut tomatoes into chunks and  add to beef mixture (including liquid).  Add
  enchilada sauce, chili powder, cumin and cilantro.  Add salt and pepper to
  taste.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes.
  
  Grease a 3-quart casserole.  Steam (or fry) tortillas.  Put approx. 1/3 of
  the meat mixture in the casserole dish followed by a layer of tortillas,
  cheese and olives. Repeat twice. Sprinkle crushed corn chips around the
  edges and bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes or until heated through.
  Cut into wedges.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple Mexican-style casserole with beef and cheese -- This a
  conglomeration of several of my favorite Mexican casserole recipes.  I took
  what I liked best from each one and this is what it turned out to be.  My
  family devoured it instantly and  completely, and it has become one of our
  favorites.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  You can adjust the seasonings to suit your own tastes; I listed
  conservative amounts (for me, anyway!).  You can also add salsa (homemade
  is best) to the casserole, if desired. Serve with fried rice (plain or
  flavored) and green salad.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: DOUBLE STOUT
 Categories: Drinks, Usenet
      Yield: 2 cases
 
      3 ga Water                             1/2    Licorice stick
  2 1/2 oz Bullion hops                             -(see note below)
     10 lb Dark malt extract                 1/2 t  Citric acid
      1 lb Black patent malt                   1 t  Irish moss
      2 lb Crystal malt                    1 1/2 oz Golding hops
    1/2 lb Barley, flaked                      2 t  Yeast nutrient
    1/4 lb Barley, roasted                   3/4 oz Ale yeast
      1 t  Ascorbic acid                            -(3 standard packages)
 
  Combine water and Bullion hops.  Boil for 20 minutes.
  
  Add dark malt extract.  Boil for 20 minutes.
  
  Add black patent malt through Irish moss.  Boil for 5 minutes.
  
  Remove from heat and add Golding hops.  Steep for 5 minutes.
  
  Cool and add yeast nutrient and ale yeast.  When fermentation has stopped,
  add priming sugar and bottle.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Double stout beer -- I would not recommend making this as your first
  beer, but if you are into brewing and like a strong stout, then give this
  one a try. Don't be in a hurry to drink it, though, it really benefits from
  a long aging. I got the original recipe from Peter Lester in
  rec.food.drink, and formatted it for my local brewfriends. Then I thought
  that the net at large might enjoy it, too, so here it is with some
  additional notes from my experience at making it. Yield: Makes about 2
  cases.
  
  *  Lester's initial specific gravity was 1.086 and his final specific
  gravity was 1.020 (alcohol about 8 percent). His fermentation time was 11
  days (a slow batch).
  
  My batch fermented in about a week (house temperature ranging between 60
  and 68). It was barely drinkable after 6 weeks, but delicious after 3
  months.  As far as I can tell, it's still getting better (a year later), 
  so try not to drink it all up right away.
  
  *  Ingredient note:  I didn't know what a licorice stick was, until I asked
  the clerk at my brewstore.  The one he gave me was about 1/3 inch in
  diameter and about 3 inches long. It was dark black, and not sweet to the
  taste at all. It seems to be a standard brewing ingredient. Sorry I can't
  be more specific about it.
  
  : Difficulty:  For experienced beer brewers only.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 2 weeks fermenting, 6 months aging.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

---------------------------------MEATBALLS---------------------------------
    1/2 lb Italian sausage,                  1/3 C  Bread crumbs
           -sweet                              1 t  Sage
    1/2 lb Ground beef, lean                   2 t  Rosemary

      2 T  Olive oil                         1/2 C  Sherry
 
  Chop the garlic very finely.  Chop the onion.  Combine in a suitable pot
  the tomato products and seasonings. Bring to a simmer.
  
  In a bowl, combine the meatball ingredients except the sherry.  Break this
  mixture apart into small balls or bits according to preference.
  
  Heat a wok or skillet and saute the meat mixture until cooked to 'rare'. Do
  not overcook or singe the meat.  Remove the grease from the meat mixture by
  straining in a colander, then return to the hot wok or skillet and reheat.
  Add sherry and reduce.  Add this to the sauce in the pot.  Simmer this
  mixture on the lowest possible heat for 6 or 7 hours. Stir occasionally.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An exotically spiced spaghetti sauce with meat -- This is a very
  adaptable sauce which can be used in any recipe requiring tomato sauces.
  Best on spaghetti with garlic bread!
  
  *  I have found that Hunt's tomato products deliver the best flavor for
  this sauce; they are somewhat sweeter and less acidic than other brands. I
  always use Lea and Perrins Worcestershire sauce.
  
  *  This spaghetti sauce is the work of about 2 years experimentation.  It
  has won some of the local cooking contests here in Maine.

      Title: IRISH SODA BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 2 loaves
 
      8 C  Flour, white                        2 t  Baking powder
           -(unbleached)                   1 1/2 t  Baking soda
      3 C  Buttermilk, room                    1 C  Currants (optional)
           -temperature (up to 4 C)            1 t  Butter or oil
      1 t  Salt                           
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Sift together the flour, baking powder,
  baking soda and salt.  Stir in  buttermilk, a cup at a time.  You should
  make a fairly soft dough that will nonetheless hold its shape. Thus, you
  may need the full amount of buttermilk.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board (this is a stock phrase; do it
  anyway).  Knead until it is smooth and soft, probably about 7 minutes.  You
  should have to keep adding a little flour to the board for the first few
  minutes to keep the dough from sticking.
  
  Are you using currants?  Knead them in, then.  Or don't, accordingly.
  
  Tear the dough in half.  Form each half into a ball.  With a knife, slash a
  cross in the top.  Place the balls, cross up, well apart, on a greased
  baking sheet. Put this sheet, bread side up, into the oven.
  
  Bake for 35 or 40 minutes.  The loaves are done when they sound hollow at a
  knocking hand.  They should also get to be a nice light brown color.  The
  cross will split open, and the resultant points will get hard and dark
  brown. Soda bread has a tendency to crack in the oven. This is no big deal.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Two white soda loaves -- This is a basic soda bread, following the Irish
  mode.  I scaled up the recipe from one of Beard's and changed it some.  It
  is quite crusty and really all-purpose. This soda bread takes around a
  third the time and a half the effort of a comparable yeast bread. Since no
  yeast bread is much like it, I don't know what would be comparable. People
  who have never tried a soda bread will note many differences, like the
  order you add things (flour and then the liquid...).
  
  *  You can substitute, per James Beard's recommendation, about 4 cups of
  whole-wheat flour for half the white.  Since this will be heavier, use
  about 40 percent more baking powder. The bread made this way is markedly
  different.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes building, 45 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

           -left on, slivered                       -(seeded and diced tiny)
           -lengthwise)                      1/4 C  Purple onion, peeled
    1/3 C  Lemon juice, fresh                       -and cut into tiny dice
    1/2 lb Cilantro (typically             1 1/2 t  Ginger root,
           -2 bunches; use the                      -peeled and grated
           -leaves only)                       1 T  Balsamic vinegar
      2    Garlic cloves (peeled             1/4 C  Olive oil
           -and finely minced)                      Salt and white pepper
 
  In a small bowl, soak scallions in lemon juice for 30 minutes.  Drain
  scallions; reserve half of the lemon juice.  Mince the scallions.
  
  In a medium-sized bowl, combine minced scallions, reserved lemon juice and
  remaining ingredients.  Mix together well.  Serve over grilled, broiled or
  roasted chicken or fish.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Tomato salsa for chicken or fish -- This makes a very flavorful topping
  for broiled chicken or fish. I got it from a column in the local paper
  about bright young chefs. The recipe is from chef Cincy Pawlcyn at Mustards
  Grill, Yountville, CA. Yield: serves 6 to 8.
  
  *  The original recipe calls for double this amount of olive oil, but that
  seemed excessive.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have a food processor.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 30 minutes soaking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: PEPPER RAINBOW SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 C  Chicken broth                       2 t  Chives
      1 md Onion, chopped                      2    Egg yolks
      2 C  Rice, cooked                        2 T  Lemon juice
      4    Bell peppers, in                         Salt and pepper,
           -assorted colors                         -to taste
    1/2 t  Savory                         
 
  Bring the broth to a boil.  Cook the rice.
  
  Chop the onion and saute the pieces until they are golden brown.  Add to
  the broth. Add the savory and chives to the broth.
  
  Clean the seeds and cores from the peppers and chop the cleaned peppers
  into pieces. Set chopped peppers aside.
  
  Add the rice to the broth and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the chopped peppers
  to the boiling broth and simmer for 1 minute. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks
  in a 2-cup bowl.
  
  Thicken the soup with the egg yolks by adding the hot soup to the beaten
  yolks a little bit at a time, stirring constantly, until a cup or two of
  soup has been added to the yolks. Dump this mixture back into the simmering
  broth. Add the lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A light summer soup with multicolored peppers -- Every year in late
  summer, produce counters fill with multicolored bell (capsicum) peppers.
  Green bell peppers, red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers. Even purple bell
  peppers. Creative chefs try hard to take advantage of the splash of colors,
  and make rainbow salads or rainbow appetizers. Here is a different way to
  rejoice in multicolored peppers: pepper soup. The peppers float to the top
  of a light broth and artfully dodge your spoon as you try to eat them.
  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  *  The thickening technique is identical to that used in avgolemono
  recipes, which you can consult for more details.
  
  *  The flavor and texture balance of the soup depends on the amount that
  the peppers are cooked. The more you cook them, the more their flavor
  exudes into the broth but the more they lose their texture. I find that
  about 2 minutes in simmering broth is the right amount.
  
  *  You can have fun with colored geometric patterns as you cut the peppers.
  They don't have to be chunks.  You can cut the yellow peppers into circles
  and the green peppers into long strips and the red peppers into cross
  sections and the purple peppers into stocky triangles. Be creative. The
  colored shapes will float to the top of the broth and play hide-and-seek
  with each other.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (egg yolk thickening and pepper cooking require
  some practice).
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: BRAN MUFFINS
 Categories: Muffins, Usenet
      Yield: 12 muffins
 
      1    Egg                               3/4 C  Whole wheat flour
  1 3/4 C  Cream                             3/4 C  Rice flour
    3/4 C  Vegetable oil                     1/3 C  Oatmeal, uncooked
      1 C  Wheat bran                          1 C  Nuts, chopped
      1 T  Baking powder                     3/4 C  Raisins
      1 t  Salt                              3/4 C  Dates, chopped
      1 C  Dark molasses                  
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease the bottoms of your muffin pan.
  Chop the nuts and dates.
  
  Beat the egg, then add to it cream and oil.  Mix this together well, then
  mix in the bran and let it sit there and absorb liquid for about five
  minutes.
  
  In another large bowl measure and slightly blend the wheat and rice flour
  and the oatmeal.
  
  Now that it's been about five minutes, add the baking powder, salt and
  molasses to the soaking bran and mix thoroughly.
  
  Dump the bran mixture into the flour mixture and blend a bit, then fold in
  the nuts, raisins and dates. Try not to mix too much because over-mixing
  can degrade the texture of the muffins.
  
  Fill muffin tins about to the top and bake at 350 degrees F. for about 25
  minutes.  You can use milk instead of cream, but the muffins will not be as
  rich and moist.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very rich and moist muffins with bran, raisins, nuts and dates -- I
  experimented a lot to find the ultimate bran muffin recipe.  I started with
  a recipe from the "Betty Crocker Cookbook," but I've changed it enough that
  I'm willing to take all the credit for it. Yield: 12 large muffins.
  
  *  Using 1/3 hazelnuts and 2/3 walnuts adds a distinctive flavor.
  
  *  I like to let the batter sit in the refrigerator for a while (a few
  hours to overnight) before I bake it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: BRAN MUFFINS II
 Categories: Muffins, Usenet
      Yield: 12 muffins
 
      1 C  Flour                               1 T  Butter
    1/2 t  Salt                                6 T  Sugar
      1 t  Baking powder                       1 C  Milk
  1 1/2 C  Bran, unprocessed                   1 C  Sultanas
      1 t  Baking soda                              -(or substitute
      1    Egg                                      -raisins, dates, etc.)
      4 t  Golden syrup                   
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Dissolve the soda in the milk.
  
  Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together.
  
  Beat the egg well, then add the milk/soda.
  
  Add the golden syrup and butter which have been heated together to melt the
  butter.
  
  Add the dry ingredients and mix quickly.  Put into greased muffin tins and
  bake for 12-15 minutes at 425 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Tasty muffins with bran and dried fruit -- This is a simple New Zealand
  recipe based on golden syrup.  The muffins make a delicious alternative to
  scones.  We eat them buttered, either hot or cold.  I've added the dried
  fruit to the original recipe as it makes them much more interesting.
  
  *  Golden syrup is a very thick sugar syrup that is readily available in
  countries where people drive on the left-hand side of the road, but seems
  to be rare elsewhere. If the gourmet section of your supermarket does not
  carry it, you could try substituting some kind of honey, such as sage
  honey.
  
  *  Any dried fruit can be used instead of sultanas, e.g. raisins, dates -
  whatever strikes your fancy.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: MELOMACARONA
 Categories: Cookies, Greek, Christmas, Usenet
      Yield: 40 pieces
 
  1 1/2 C  Olive oil                           2 C  Semolina, finely ground
    1/2 C  Butter, unsalted                    6 C  Flour
           -(at room temperature)            1/2 t  Baking soda
      1 C  Beer                              1/2 t  Baking powder
    3/4 t  Cinnamon, ground                    1 t  Salt
    1/4 t  Ground cloves, ground           1 1/2 C  Sugar (for the syrup)
           Orange peel (use the            1 1/2 C  Honey
           -grated peel of one orange)         1 C  Water
      1 C  Sugar                             1/2 C  Walnuts, chopped
 
  Put the olive oil, butter, beer, cinnamon, cloves, orange peel and sugar in
  a mixing bowl and beat until they are thoroughly blended.
  
  Sift about one cup of flour with the baking soda, baking powder and salt
  and blend into the mixture. Add the semolina, a cup at a time, into the
  mixture.
  
  Add the enough of the remaining flour, a cup at a time, until you get a
  rather firm dough (you may need a bit more or less than the amount
  mentioned in the ingredients list). Use your hands to do the mixing, as an
  electric mixer will be useless after the first two or three C of flour have
  been added.
  
  Roll the dough into cylinders, about two inches long and  one inch in
  diameter, flatten them with your hands, and place them on cookie sheets
  greased with a little olive oil.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for half an hour.
  Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool for about half an hour.
  
  Make the syrup:  mix the sugar, honey and water, and bring them to a boil.
  Cook on low heat for three minutes and skim off the foam that forms on top.
  Pour the hot syrup over the cookies, sprinkle them with the chopped walnuts
  and let them soak overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional greek Christmas cookies soaked in honey syrup -- This is one
  of the two kinds of confection that are traditionally consumed in large
  quantities in Greece during the holiday season (the other is kourabiedes).
  I suppose the name translates to something like "honey macaroons", except
  that they are not really macaroons. I got the recipe from a greek cookbook.
  
  *  You can use flour instead of semolina, but only as a last resort, as you
  won't be able to get that wonderful grainy texture which you get if you use
  semolina.
  
  *  The amounts given here are for only half a recipe.  Considering that it
  is very hard to eat only one melomacarono, making the full recipe may not
  be as outrageous as it sounds!
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking, 30 minutes cooling,
  overnight soaking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SPINACH LASAGNA
 Categories: Pasta, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     32 oz Tomato sauce                       16 oz Mozzarella cheese
      1 lb Tomatoes, canned                         -(or less)
      2 md Onions (or less)                   16 oz Other cheese
      8    Garlic cloves                            -(cheddar, swiss, jack,
      8 oz Black olives,                            -etc.; can use less)
           -drained (optional)               1/2 C  Parsley (optional)
      8 oz Green olives,                      12 oz Spinach (or less)
           -drained (optional)                 3    Eggs
      8 oz Mushrooms (optional)                2 lb Lasagna noodles
      1 lg Broccoli bunch                           -(approximately 2 boxes)
           -(optional)                              Italian spices, to taste
     16 oz Cottage cheese              
 
  SAUCE:  Put tomatoes and tomato sauce in large pot over low heat.  Press
  garlic, add.  Chop onions, olives, mushrooms and broccoli, add.  Add spices
  to taste. Simmer covered over low heat until the whole tomatoes have merged
  with the rest of the sauce and you can no longer tell where one begins and
  the other ends.
  
  CHEESE:  Grate the cheeses and mix.  Add eggs, parsley and spinach, mix
  well.
  
  BUILDING THE LASAGNA:  In a lasagna pan, put in just enough sauce  to cover
  the bottom of the pan.  Make a layer of noodles.  Using about half of the
  available cheese mixture, make a layer of cheese.  Another layer of
  noodles. Cover the noodles with sauce, the important thing being to make
  sure all noodles have at least some sauce on them. Another layer of
  noodles.  Use the rest of the cheese mixture and make a layer of cheese.
  Put down the  last layer of noodles, then use the remaining amount of
  sauce, or as much as possible, and cover the noodles in sauce. Bake at 375
  degrees F. for 45 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Classic spinach lasagna -- This recipe was posted to usenet by
  sridhar@spt.tek.com, who got it from Sean Gilley (slg@e.ms.uky.edu).  I
  modified it slightly to my tastes (naturally).  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  *  The lasagna noodles are uncooked when you build the lasagna.  Be stingy
  with the sauce, if you aren't, you'll end up short at the end where you
  need it most.
  
  *  If you do things as specified here, you will end up with a lasagna
  layered as (s-n-c-n-s-n-c-n-s), (sauce, noodles, cheese, etc.) but some
  prefer the heretic's way: (c-n-s-c-n-s-c-n-s)
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  2-3 hours.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES II
 Categories: Candy, Usenet
      Yield: 10 dozen
 
      2 lb Dark, coating chocolate             3 oz Butter, unsalted
      6 oz Chocolate, unsweetened,         1 1/4 C  Cointreau
           -baking (or more, to taste)    
 
  Chop the chocolate.  Melt together with the butter over simmering water.
  Stir continuously with a rubber spatula. Don't let water get into the
  chocolate.
  
  Warm the Cointreau to the same temperature as the chocolate.  Slowly blend
  the Cointreau into the chocolate (still over the water). Stir continuously.
  Do this slowly (as if you were making Hollandaise). Using an electric
  mixer, beat the mixture until cool and somewhat thickened. (Takes about 5
  minutes; you'll need a good mixer.)
  
  Line a large baking sheet (11 x 17) with wax paper.  Pour in the truffle
  mix. (This will fill the pan.) Chill in the refrigerator until solid
  (several hours).
  
  Use a pizza cutter to cut the stuff into strips (peel off the wax paper
  first), then into squares.  Take each one, mash it in your palm, and roll
  in cocoa. Chill some more.
  
  I recommend Merckens Yucatan or Lindt Extra Bittersweet for the dark
  coating chocolate. In place of the Cointreau, try substituting other
  liqueurs (Chambord, Amaretto, Kahlua) and coatings (chopped roasted
  almonds, finely chopped candied orange peel, coffee beans run through a
  nutmeg grinder, etc.)
  
  Truffles rolled in cocoa are "classic", here are some rough and ready
  instructions for coating anything with chocolate, abstracted from "Making
  Chocolates" by Alec Leaver, published in 1975 by Weathervane Books by
  arrangement with Michael Joseph Ltd.  (The book is out of print.)
  
  Melt some chocolate over hot water, let it cool slowly until it just
  thickens (80-84 F). Now warm the chocolate gently and slowly until it thins
  slightly. The temperature should be above 85, but below 91. This maximum
  working temperature is absolutely crucial. The temperature of the room you
  work in should not exceed 70.
  
  Pre-bottom all centers, that is, smear a little couverature on what will be
  the bottom of the center with the back of a spoon and place it, bottom side
  up, on a plate.  This lets you check that the couverature is properly
  tempered.
  
  After the bases have set and hardened a little, stir the couverature
  thoroughly, trying not to get too many air-bubbles in.  Drop a center into
  the couverature, bottom down and, with an ordinary fork, slightly warmed,
  push it down to submerge it fully. Immediately, pick it out with the fork,
  tap the fork on the side of the bowl in order to settle the chocolate, and
  wipe any excess from underneath the fork. Transfer the center to a sheet of
  wax paper. Stir the couverature after depositing each center to keep it
  well mixed.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Classic chocolate confectionery -- These are as good, or better, than
  anything you can buy in a store.
  
  *  The basis of the truffle centre is ganache paste, a mixture of melted
  chocolate and warm cream well blended and cooled until it hardens.  Orange,
  honey, peppermint, rum or vanilla can be added to give flavor, but it is
  important that the final mixture should be hard enough to be moulded to
  shape and be capable of standing up to being coated with chocolate.
  
  *  The texture of ganache paste depends upon the kinds of cream and
  chocolate and the proportions in which they are used. Plain chocolate is
  harder than milk chocolate, so more cream can be added to it. Single cream
  is thinner than double so must be used in smaller quantities. Incorporating
  cream or other liquids fulfills two functions: it softens the chocolate and
  it gives flavor. After the centre has been made and moulded to shape, it is
  coated with chocolate to seal it and help to keep it moist. It is then
  rolled in a final decorative coating, and this can cocoa sweetened with a
  little icing sugar, or chopped mixed nuts.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate for classic truffles, quite difficult for coated
  centers.
  : Time:  most of a day.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: LAMB VINDALOO
 Categories: Meats, Indian, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Lamb, cubed                       1/2 t  Cinnamon
      2 T  Coriander seed                    1/2 t  Cloves
      1 T  Cumin seed                        1/2 t  Cayenne
      2 lb Tomatoes, crushed                   2 t  Mustard seed, ground
     14    Garlic cloves, crushed              1 T  Turmeric
      6    Bay leaves                          1 C  Wine vinegar
           Ginger (fresh), 2 inches,           2 md Onions
           -finely chopped                     2 md Potatoes
    1/2 t  Black pepper, ground                2 T  Butter
    1/2 t  Cardamon seed                  
 
  Lightly roast the cumin seed and coriander seed by frying with no oil for a
  minute or so, stirring constantly.  Grind these and combine them into a
  paste with the other spices, the garlic, ginger and the vinegar. Add the
  lamb to the marinade and mix well. Refrigerate for 3-24 hours while mixing
  every few hours as convenient.
  
  Finely chop the onions and potatoes and saute them for 5 minutes in the
  butter.
  
  Add lamb and spice paste and simmer over low heat for half an hour.  The
  marinating does add a lot of flavor and makes the meat much more tender.
  This can be skipped if need be.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spicy hot Indian lamb dish -- Very loosely based on Dharamjit Singh's
  recipe in "Indian Cookery:  A Practical Guide."  Most restaurants that
  serve this dish pronounce it vinDAloo, with the stress on the second
  syllable.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy (though it's easy to burn the spices while roasting
  them).
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 1 day marinating, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: KOURABIEDES
 Categories: Cookies, Greek, Christmas, Usenet
      Yield: 30 pieces
 
      2 C  Butter, unsalted                    6 C  Flour
      1 C  Sugar, powdered                   1/2 C  Almonds (blanched),
      3    Egg yolks                                -chopped
      3 T  Brandy                              1 lb Sugar, powdered
      2 t  Vanilla extract                          -(one package)
 
  Beat the butter with the sugar until it becomes fluffy.  Add the egg yolks
  one by one, beating continuously. Add the brandy and vanilla.
  
  Blend in the almonds and the flour, a cup at a time.  Use enough flour to
  get a firm dough (it may take a bit more or less than the amount mentioned
  in the ingredients list). Use your hands to do the mixing, as an electric
  mixer will be useless after the first two or three cups of flour have been
  added. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least one hour.
  
  Shape the dough into balls, about one inch in diameter, flatten them and
  place on greased cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes.
  
  Remove from the oven.  Roll each cookie (while it is still hot) in the
  powdered sugar and put it back on the cookie sheet.  Repeat this step once
  more, so that you get a thicker coating.
  
  Place the coated cookies on a platter, liberally sprinkling each layer and
  the bottom of the platter with powdered sugar. When you are done, there
  shouldn't be any sugar left. Let them cool and they are ready to eat!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional Greek Christmas cookies coated with powdered sugar -- This
  is one of the two kinds of confection that are traditionally consumed in
  large quantities in Greece during the holiday season (the other is
  melomacarona). As a quick lesson in greek, "kourabiedes" (pronounced
  "kou-ra-bi-ETH-es", is the plural of the word "kourabies" (kou-ra-bi-ES).
  Now all you need to enjoy them is the recipe. I got this one from a Greek
  cookbook and translated it into English.
  
  *  The cookbook suggests the following variations:  using ouzo or scotch
  instead of brandy, and almond extract instead of vanilla extract, but I
  have not tried any of them. Also, putting granulated instead of powdered
  sugar in the dough didn't seem to affect the recipe, there's so much sugar
  in it, that you couldn't tell the difference anyway.
  
  *  The cookbook also suggested using twice the amount of sugar for coating.
  This is obviously too much, but it should make you realize that you must
  really be liberal with the sugar!
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy to moderate.

      Title: SESAME GRANOLA
 Categories: Grains, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 C  Vegetable oil                       2 C  Wheat flakes
    1/2 C  Honey                               1 C  Sunflower seeds
      1 t  Vanilla extract                     1 C  Raisins
      2 C  Rolled oats (quick                3/4 C  Sesame seeds
           -or old fashioned                 1/2 C  Walnuts, chopped
           -oatmeal, uncooked)               1/2 C  Coconut, flaked
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine all the dry ingredients and mix
  well (do not break up the wheat flakes).
  
  Heat oil, honey and vanilla in a large saucepan.  Remove from heat and mix
  in the other ingredients stir until everything is coated well. Spread into
  a 13x19-inch baking pan and bake at 350 degrees F. for 15-20 min or until
  golden brown. Allow to cool before removing from pan.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A crunchy sesame seed granola -- I got this recipe from the back of a
  page from a green engineering pad with a circuit diagram on the other side.
  Where it came from before that I do not know. Yield: About 6 servings.
  
  *  These are much better than any store bought granola.  I eat it as desert
  or carry it instead of gorp when backpacking. It is very good eaten
  straight, with no milk.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: HONEY GRAHAM CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers, Usenet
      Yield: 3 dozen
 
    1/2 C  Butter                            1/2 t  Cinnamon, ground
      2 C  Graham flour                      1/4 C  Honey
      1 t  Baking powder                       1    Egg, beaten
      2 T  Brown sugar                       1/4 C  Water, hot
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut
  butter into flour until mixture has the texture of cornmeal.  Stir in
  baking powder, brown sugar and cinnamon. Add egg and hot water and mix
  until well blended.
  
  Knead dough 2 or 3 minutes.  Set half aside.  Roll out into a square about
  1/8 inch thick. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Score dough into about
  2-inch squares, using a sharp knife. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 10 minutes
  or until lightly browned. Roll out and bake remaining half of dough. Cool
  baked crackers and gently separate into squares.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  North American crackers with graham flour, honey and cinnamon -- I
  originally got this recipe from a newspaper and played around a bit until I
  thought it tasted like Sunshine Honey Grahams.  I've occasionally used
  ordinary whole wheat flour when I didn't have any graham flour and it still
  worked alright.  Graham flour is coarser.  Yield:  Makes 36-40.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (judgment required).
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Betty Post's quick fish chowder -- When I left for my first job out of
  school, my mother was convinced that I'd starve to death.  She gave me a
  set of easy recipes on index cards in hopes that I'd occasionally eat at
  home instead of Denny's. This is one of those recipes. It's quick and easy,
  and tastes great.

      Title: GRAMMY'S DARK ROLLS
 Categories: Breads, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 1 dozen
 
    1/2 C  Oatmeal (rolled oats)             1/2 oz Yeast (dry), active
    1/2 C  Whole wheat flour                        -(2 packages; do not
    1/8 t  Salt                                     -use quick-rising yeast)
    1/4 C  Shortening                          1 t  Honey
      2 T  Molasses                            1    Egg
      2 T  Honey                           2 1/2 C  Flour, unbleached
      1 C  Water, boiling                           -(up to 3 1/2 C)
    1/2 C  Water, warm            
 
  Combine oatmeal, whole-wheat flour, salt, shortening, molasses and honey.
  Pour boiling water over all.  Mix and let cool.
  
  While cooling, dissolve yeast in warm water with the honey.  Add egg to
  cooled batter, then mix in dissolved yeast.
  
  Add flour until dough is just soft enough to knead.  Knead lightly.  Place
  dough in a greased bowl; cover with a damp cloth.  Let rise in warm place
  until  doubled in bulk; about one hour.
  
  Punch down dough and cut into 12 equal pieces.  Shape each piece into a
  ball in put into a greased 9-inch pan. Let rise again for 45 minutes.
  
  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 40 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Holiday rolls with oatmeal and molasses -- This recipe has long been
  part of my Thanksgiving tradition. I have long since forgotten its source.
  
  *  These rolls are really wonderful, but they need time to rise.  start
  them as early in the day as possible. Don't even think about using the
  quick-rise yeasts.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  several hours preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES (French-style)
 Categories: Candy, Usenet
      Yield: 5 pounds
 
      3 lb Chocolate (semi-sweet             1/2 lb Butter, sweet (i.e.
           -or semi-bittersweet)                    -unsalted butter)
      1 qt Cream, very heavy                        Cocoa powder
 
  Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler.  Do not cook the
  chocolate. This should be done SLOWLY over minimum heat.
  
  Boil the cream.  Once the chocolate is completely melted and the cream just
  boiled, combine in the top of the double boiler.  Take off the top pan from
  the water, and (off heat) mix until completely combined.  Keep stirring
  until it is relatively cool. Allow to sit until it is cool enough to put
  into a refrigerator.
  
  Refrigerate overnight (NO SHORT CUTS HERE!!!).
  
  The next morning, melt this wonderful mixture again in a double boiler.
  When it is completely melted again, mix in the butter until it is
  completely absorbed. Whip, either with a hand whisk or a very slow electric
  gizmo, until the butter is completely absorbed and the mixture is cool
  again.  This can take an hour or longer, depending upon the chocolate, etc.
  Let cool and refrigerate overnight once more (this is not as critical as
  the first cooling; a few hours will be enough).
  
  Heat once again and whip until cool.   Refrigerate until it is thick enough
  to pipe through a pastry bag. Using a 1/2 nozzle, make little balls on a
  big piece of parchment paper that has cocoa powder spread on it. Roll in
  the powder. Keep chilled until just before serving. Let them return to just
  above room temperature before eating.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  French-style chocolate confectionery -- For those of you who are crazy
  enough about chocolate to go to the extremes that I do, here is the recipe
  for the chocolate truffles that I make. The formula is taken from Paul
  Bocuse's "French Cooking," but the directions are my own.
  
  *  If you like Grand Marnier or Kahlua or rum or whatever in your
  chocolate, the last melting step is the time to add. I think it's a small
  but forgivable sin myself.
  
  *  I recommend Guittard chocolate.  You can buy their semisweet chips in 12
  ounce bags.  You can also buy it in 10 pound bars.  You can also buy
  10-pound bars of Guittards "French Vanilla Semi bittersweet" which is so
  good you might eat all of it before you cook with it. Guittard makes 5
  types of bittersweet if you like you chocolate really bitter. I use
  Hershey's Cocoa.  Still the best for my taste.
  
  *  Use genuine, real-live, honest "heavy cream" and not ultra-pasteurized
  whipping cream.  Try a wholesale dairy.  I only use Challenge Sweet Butter.
  Under no circumstances should you use anything but unsalted butter in this
  recipe.
  
  : Difficulty:  quite difficult (melting the chocolate 3 times requires
  tremendous care).
  : Time:  3 or 4 hours of preparation during a 3-day period.
  : : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: OATMEAL HONEY BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 2 loaves
 
      2 C  Oatmeal, uncooked                   1 C  Water, lukewarm
           -(e.g., Quaker's Old              2/3 C  Milk
           -Fashioned Oatmeal)                 5 C  Flour, unbleached
    2/3 C  Honey                                    -(up to 6 C; may
      2 T  Salt                                     -substitute up to 2 C
      3 T  Butter (or margarine)                    -whole wheat)
      1 C  Water, boiling                           Oil
      2 pk Yeast (dry), active            
 
  Put the oatmeal, honey, salt and butter in a large mixing bowl.  Add
  boiling water and mix together. Let stand for 45 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Following the yeast package directions, add the yeast to lukewarm water,
  and let it soften for about 5 minutes. Add the yeast mixture to the oats
  and honey mixture. Mix in the milk and stir well.
  
  Stir in the flour, 1/2 cup at a time.  When the dough is too stiff to stir,
  pour it out onto a well-floured surface and knead it firmly, adding a
  little flour if necessary. Knead it until the dough is smooth and elastic
  (about 6-8 minutes). Form the dough into a ball. Place the dough into a
  large greased bowl, coating the entire ball of dough.
  
  Cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm, cozy, humid place.  (I put it
  in a cool oven, with a small saucepan of hot tap water sitting on the
  bottom of the oven.) Let rise for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the dough has
  doubled in bulk.
  
  Punch down the dough and split in half.  Spread the dough into two greased
  loaf pans, coating the dough as before, and cover with a damp cloth,  and
  let rise for about an hour in a warm, cozy, humid place.
  
  Bake at 350 F for 35-40 minutes, or until loaves sound hollow when tapped.
  Cool on a bread rack for about ten minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A yeast bread for people who like oatmeal.  Yield:  makes 2 loaves.
  
  *  Kneading is difficult to describe in words, but many cookbooks have
  pictures.  The idea is to exercise the dough and work some more flour into
  it. Bread freezes very well; give it an hour or so to thaw, then heat it up
  at 350 degrees F. for about ten minutes.
  
  *  Instant and quick-cooking oatmeal is not satisfactory in this recipe.
  Besides the ubiquitous Quaker oats, you can use any commercial rolled oats
  or steel-cut oats. If you use the steel-cut oats, then soak for 1 hour in
  step 1.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you already know how to knead dough, moderate
  otherwise.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 4 1/2 hours waiting time.
  : Precision:  All amounts (including times) are approximate.

      Yield: 1 cake
 
      1 C  Margarine                       1 1/2 C  Flour
    1/2 C  Cocoa                             1/8 t  Salt
      2 C  Sugar                           1 1/2 C  Peanuts, chopped
      4    Eggs, slightly beaten               2 C  Miniature marshmallows
      1 t  Vanilla                        
 
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Melt the margarine in a saucepan.  Add the cocoa
  and stir until blended. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the sugar,
  eggs, vanilla, and mix them all together.
  
  Combine the flour, salt and the nuts in a bowl, and stir so that the nuts
  are coated with the flour. Add this gradually to the mixture in the
  saucepan.
  
  Spoon this into a greased 13 x 9 x 2 pan and bake for 35-40 minutes in the
  preheated oven.  Spread the marshmallows on the warm cake.
  
  When the cake cools, you will notice the reasoning behind its name.  It may
  not look like much, but it sure tastes great.

 Categories: Sauces, Pasta, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 T  Olive oil                           1 C  Water
      1    Garlic clove                        2 t  Basil, dried
      1 sm Onion, chopped                    1/4 t  Black pepper

     16 oz Tomato paste                             Oregano (optional)
 
  Brown the garlic in the olive oil in a 6-qt. pan.  Add the onion and brown
  until transparent.  (You can saute a tomato in here also if you want.)  Add
  the rest of the ingredients and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring often.
  (Longer cooking won't hurt.)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very easy and cheap spaghetti sauce -- This recipe is from Consumer
  Reports, which rated it as much better than most bottled sauces -- and
  cheaper.
  
  You can add whatever additional ingredients you like (shrooms, tomatoes,
  etc.) to this basic recipe. It is better than bottled sauces!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH CHIPPED BEEF AND BACON
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8    Chicken breast halves              13 oz Mushroom soup
           -(4 whole breasts)                       -concentrate (e.g.
      4 oz Chipped beef                             -1 can Campbell's soup)
           -(1 package)                        1 C  Sour cream
      8 sl Bacon                          
 
  Cut chipped beef into strips.  Line the baking pan with them.
  
  Wrap bacon around chicken.  Put in pan on top of beef.
  
  Mix soup and sour cream.  Pour mixture over chicken.  Cover tightly and
  refrigerate overnight, or at least several hours.  It comes out better if
  you do it overnight.
  
  Bake in 275 degree F. oven, uncovered, for three hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Succulent and easy chicken -- This recipe makes the most succulent and
  juicy chicken I've had.  It is very easy to make.  The only drawback is
  that you have to start the night before you want to serve it. It would be a
  good recipe for when you have company, since you can do most of the work
  the previous day.
  
  *  A note on ingredients for non-US cooks:  "chipped beef" is cooked spiced
  beef cut into very thin slices and packaged for sandwiches.  A worthy
  substitute is  roast beef sliced very thin and seasoned lightly with salt
  and pepper. A "can of mushroom soup," such as Campbell's soup, is 1 1/2
  cups of double-strength cream soup concentrate. You can substitute the
  Knorr Swiss dried mushroom soup mix (available worldwide) if you make it
  with a mixture of milk and water. Use 1/2 of a 70-gram package of soup mix
  with 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk. Cook the soup according to package
  directions, then let cool.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 day waiting, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: MEATBALLS IN TOMATO SAUCE
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
-----------------------------SAUCE INGREDIENTS:-----------------------------
     13 oz Tomatoes, canned                    1    Garlic clove, minced
           -(1 large can), coarsely          1/2 C  Parsley, chopped
           -chopped, with juice                1 t  Chili powder
      4 oz Tomato sauce (1 small can)    

---------------------------MEATBALL INGREDIENTS:---------------------------
      1 lb Pork sausage                        1    Egg
    1/2 C  Parsley, chopped                    1 lb Pasta (tagliarini,
    1/2 C  Cracker crumbs                           -spaghetti or whatever)
    1/2 C  Parmesan cheese (grated)       
 
  Combine the sauce ingredients and bring to a boil while preparing the
  meatballs.  Mix all meatball ingredients.  It is easiest to do this with
  your hands. Form into walnut-sized balls.
  
  Drop the meatballs into BOILING sauce.  If the sauce is not boiling, the
  meatballs will fall to pieces.  Simmer gently for about an hour.  If you
  are making the sauce to eat right away, you will probably want to skim the
  grease that cooks out of the sausage periodically. If you are making this
  ahead, the grease will congeal when it sits overnight in the refrigerator,
  and you can remove it easily then.
  
  Check for salt.  Depending on the brands of sausage and tomatoes you use,
  you may not need any. If you need to add salt, be sparing.
  
  Boil the pasta.  Pour the sauce and meatballs over it and serve with grated
  parmesan, or combine and reheat in a casserole, sprinkled with parmesan.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple meatballs in herb and garlic tomato sauce -- I've been making
  this recipe since I was about 10 years old, and I don't remember where we
  got it. It's easy and very good, though. Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  This is fine made a day ahead.  Chilling it gives you a chance to remove
  the grease that cooks out of the sausage.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  want to speed this up, put the dough in the freezer, but keep an eye on it.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Drop dough in 1/2 t amounts on an ungreased
  cookie sheet.  Dip a glass in dough and wipe excess off.  Then dip the
  glass in sugar and flatten a cookie. Repeat the dip-in-sugar flatten-cookie
  sequence until all are done.  The cookies won't spread in baking, so you
  can easily judge how far apart to put them (you want room to cook, but not
  to grow). If you find that the dough is getting too soft to flatten easily,
  put it in the refrigerator between batches.
  
  Bake for about 5-6 minutes, until the edges are JUST beginning to turn
  golden brown. Take off the cookie sheet and put on waxed paper or foil to
  cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Delicate and buttery sugar cookies.
  
  *  You can add 2-3 T cocoa to about 1 1/2 cups dough for chocolate cookies,
  or add cinnamon to the dipping sugar for spice cookies. I like the sugar
  cookies plain, so I've never actually tried this.
  
  *  These cookies don't freeze well, because they pick up the flavors of the
  other things in the freezer.  Make only as many as you can eat before they
  go stale.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

  minutes final preparation and baking.

      Title: ED'S PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE
 Categories: Candy, Usenet
      Yield: 3 pounds
 
      1 lb Peanut butter, smooth               1 ts Vanilla extract
           -(natural)                         12 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet
      1 lb Sugar, powdered                          -(otherwise known as
    1/2 lb Butter (2 sticks,                        -1 bag chocolate chips)
           -save the wrappers)            
 
  Melt the chocolate in a bowl over hot water or the top of a double boiler.
  Make sure you don't get even a drop of water in the chocolate.  Stir
  frequently with a spatula while doing the following steps and remove it
  from the hot water just as soon as it's melted.
  
  Melt the butter.  Mix together the powdered sugar, the melted butter and
  the vanilla. Don't bother sifting the powdered sugar. Just stir everything
  together with a wooden spoon until it's smooth and creamy.  Stir in the
  peanut butter. This will break most flimsy wooden spoons if you're not
  careful. Mushing everything together with your hands works well and is lots
  of fun.
  
  Press the fudge into a buttered 8 or 9 square pan.  You don't need much
  butter, just wipe the butter papers over the inside of the pan.  You can
  also line the pan with foil and butter that; this works especially well if
  you're making several batches in a row to give to people as holiday
  presents. Press the fudge in firmly; you don't want any air bubbles in it.
  You will get your hands messy here.
  
  Pour the chocolate over the fudge and spread it in an even layer.  The
  easiest way to do this is to shake the pan gently until the chocolate is
  even.  Let the chocolate cool to room temperature. DO NOT PUT IT IN THE
  REFRIGERATOR.
  
  Using a sharp knife cut the fudge into 1 squares.  If you defied my
  instructions and put it in the refrigerator, the chocolate layer will
  shatter when you try to cut it. Unless you are going to serve it
  immediately, store it in the refrigerator. Let it come to room temperature
  before serving.
  
  Again, don't scrimp on the peanut butter!  Skippy simply will not do.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An extremely rich candy -- I got this recipe from a friend, Ed
  Firestone, who is arguably the best cook in Palo Alto. The results resemble
  Reese's Peanut Butter Cups that have attained Nirvana. Don't scrimp on the
  peanut butter; get the best you can find or make it yourself. If there's
  anything besides peanuts and salt in it, find another brand.
  
  *  Unless you use the foil method, you will inevitably destroy at least one
  piece getting it out of the pan.  The best method is to line the pan with
  foil, let the fudge cool, lift it out, peel off the foil, put it back in
  the pan and cut it. This keeps it from sticking to the pan. If you try to
  cut it out of the pan, it tends to fall apart.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHICKEN KORMA
 Categories: Poultry, Indian, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Chicken breast                     12    Green cardamom seeds,
           -halves, boned                           -whole, cracked
    1/2 C  Safflower oil                            -(or less; or use 2 t
    1/4 C  Butter, clarified                        -of ground cardamom)
           -(the Indians call                  5    Bay leaves
           -this stuff "ghee")                 1 t  Salt
      6 md Yellow onions                   1 1/2 t  Coriander (ground)
      3    Cloves garlic, fresh              1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
  1 1/2 t  Ginger (use fresh                        -(or more to taste)
           -ginger if you can                  8 oz Yogurt, plain
           -find it)                         1/2 C  Water
     20    Cloves, whole                     1/2 C  Milk
 
  Cut the chicken breasts into bite-size pieces and set aside.  Peel the
  onions and chop them fine. You should have about 3 cups of onion. Mince the
  garlic and add to the bowl of chopped onions.
  
  In a big frypan that has a lid, heat the butter and oil, then saute the
  onions and garlic for about 10 minutes, until the first hint of browning.
  Use "medium-high" heat.
  
  Crack the cardamom seeds between your fingers, just to get the shell open.
  Add them to the pan.  Add the ginger, cloves, bay leaves and salt.  Saute
  until the onions are nice and brown, about 5 more minutes.
  
  Mix the coriander and red pepper with the yogurt.  Add the yogurt to the
  frypan, stirring as you pour, slowly enough that the onion doesn't stop
  bubbling.  It could take several minutes to do this, depending on the
  diameter of your frypan. When the last of the yogurt dries up, add the
  chicken pieces and brown them. Add 1/2 cup water, reduce heat, cover and
  simmer 20 minutes.
  
  Stir in the milk and turn off the heat.  It needs to sit a few minutes to
  let the flavors blend. The longer you let it sit after cooking, the better
  it will taste (up to several hours).
  
  While the chicken is sitting, cook some rice.  I make saffron rice to go
  with this dish.
  
  Fish out the bay leaves and as many of the whole cloves as you can find,
  before serving.  Americans don't seem to like to eat whole cloves in their
  food.  Check to make sure it is moist enough (it should have the
  consistency of applesauce). Reheat over low heat. Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indian braised chicken with onions, cloves and ginger -- I learned to
  like Indian food in London, where delicious Indian food can be had in
  simple restaurants at hamburger prices and the fare at fancy places ranks
  among the finest food on Earth. Back in America, to satisfy my new craving
  for good Indian food I had to learn to cook it myself. This is a
  Friday-night supper dish in our family, too complex for a weekday meal, and
  too plain to serve to company.
  
  Indian food is often quite elaborate, so by their standards this is a fast
  and simple dish. It is a classical Indian recipe, found in many cookbooks.
  
  *  Indians put a lot more salt in their cooking than this recipe calls for;
  if you want to make it more authentic you should double the salt. Indians
  also don't like chicken skin and will go to great lengths to prevent even
  small pieces of chicken skin from getting into the food. I rather like
  chicken skin myself, and I don't try very hard to keep it out of this dish.
  
  *  If you can't find green cardamom seeds, don't bother using white ones,
  they've been bleached and processed and don't have much flavor left.  Use
  ground cardamom instead.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (timing is somewhat important)
  : Time:  1 hour plus "sitting time."
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SOURDOUGH FRENCH BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Sourdough, Usenet
      Yield: 1 loaf
 
      1 C  Sourdough starter                   2 t  Salt
    1/2 C  Milk (any type, but                 2 T  Shortening
           -I prefer whole milk)           2 1/2 C  Flour
      1 T  Sugar                          
 
  Combine milk, sugar, salt and shortening in a pan.  Heat until shortening
  melts, then cool to lukewarm (about 110 degrees F.).
  
  Stir milk into starter.  Add flour gradually, forming dough that pulls away
  from sides of the bowl.  Knead until smooth (about 15 minutes), adding
  flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the board. When done,
  the dough will be fairly heavy, but smooth in texture.
  
  Place in a well-greased bowl and raise in a warm place until doubled.  Form
  into a long loaf (about 16 inches long).  Place on a greased baking sheet
  and let rise again, until almost doubled.
  
  Cut diagonal slits in top of loaf with a sharp knife and bake in a 400
  degree oven until done, about 30-35 min. Remove from pan and let cool in a
  draft-free location.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An old-fashioned sourdough French bread -- This is a hearty bread,
  possibly heavier than many people are used to. The flavor is wonderfully
  tangy and complements just about any meal. Try it with garlic butter!
  
  This bread is slow raising.  I usually spend two days on it, start the
  dough one day, let it rise overnight, then form the loaf and bake the next
  day. This recipe is from "The Complete Sourdough Cookbook," by Don and
  Myrtle Holm.
  
  *  Be careful that the milk mixture has cooled before adding it to the
  starter.   If it's too hot, you'll kill the starter and the bread won't
  rise.
  
  *  Since the dough rises for a long time, I usually cover it with a damp
  towel to keep it from drying out.
  
  *  If you want a chewy crust, brush the top of the loaf with a mixture of
  corn starch and water before baking. Also, placing a pan of water in the
  oven while baking will make the crust a little softer. I usually brush the
  loaf with butter after baking.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, long rising time, 1/2 hour baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: AFRICAN VEGETABLE STEW
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Onion (very large),                      Several fresh tomatoes
           -chopped                                 -(or large can)
      1    Swiss chard bunch                   1    Garlic clove
      1 cn Garbanzo beans                           -(or more to taste)
           -(known also as chick                    Salt and pepper,
           -peas, ceci, etc.)                       -to taste
    1/2 C  Raisins                                  Tabasco sauce,
    1/2 C  Rice, raw                                -to taste
      2    Yams      
 
  Fry onion, garlic and white stems of chard until barely limp.  Add chopped
  greens and fry a bit.
  
  Either peel the yams or scrub them well with a vegetable brush, then slice
  them into thick slices.  Add garbanzos, raisins, yams, tomatoes, salt and
  pepper.  Cook a couple of minutes.
  
  Make a well in the center of the mixture in the pot.  Put the rice in the
  well and pat it down until it's wet. Cover and cook until rice is done,
  about 25 minutes. Add Tabasco sauce to taste.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spicy vegetable stew -- I got this recipe from my mom, who got it from
  a friend. It's very easy to make.
  
  *  I find that the flavors of the vegetables don't stand out unless you put
  in a lot of tabasco. But then, I've got a cast-iron tongue. You should add
  enough to make the stew seem spicy to you.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: MURGH MUSALLAM (Chicken Curry)
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Chicken                            14    Black peppercorns
      1    Ginger piece, fresh                      -(or less)
           -(about 3/4 inch of                 8    Cloves (or less)
           -a ginger root)                     1 t  Turmeric
     14    Garlic cloves                       1 t  Red chili powder
           -(or less)                               -(or substitute fresh
      1 lg Onion                                    -red chilies, diced)
      1    Cinnamon stick                      2    Green chilies
      2    Brown cardamom pods,              1/2 C  Yogurt
           -whole                            1/4 C  Oil (preferably ghee,
      4    Green cardamom pods,                     -if available)
           -whole                                   Salt to taste
      1    Star anise, whole                        Coriander leaves,
           -(use all 8 arms and                     -fresh (optional)
           -the seeds inside them)        
 
  Clean and joint chicken.  If you don't like the skin, remove it.
  
  Mash the ginger into a paste (or chop finely) and mince the garlic.
  
  Heat oil in a large frying pan.  Use "medium-high heat".
  
  Break apart the star anise to release the seeds inside the arms.  To the
  frypan, add onions, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, star aniseed,
  peppercorns, cloves, garlic and ginger. Be careful not to burn the garlic.
  Saute until the onions are cooked but not browned.
  
  Add the chicken, turmeric and chili powder and cook on a medium heat,
  stirring often.
  
  When the oil starts to separate (the gravy will have oil floating on its
  surface), add the yogurt and cook till the chicken is done and the gravy is
  thick.  Finally, add the fresh coriander leaves.
  
  This is the basic recipe.  Try  varying the whole spice combinations until
  you find a favorite. The recipe doubles well.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken curry -- This recipe is the real thing.  Throw out your curry
  powder:  you'll never use it again once you've  tried this recipe.  Chicken
  curry using the real spices cannot be beat!!  Yield:  serves 2-3.
  
  *  A cardamom pod is not the same thing as a cardamom seed.  Make sure you
  get the pods. A pod is about the size of a pea and contains seeds inside
  it. Don't substitute the ground version of any of the whole spices, the
  effect will not be the same. And don't use white cardamom pods.
  
  *  You may want to remove the smaller whole spices prior to adding the
  yogurt so that unwitting guests don't eat them. Try the recommended
  quantity of garlic. The flavour is surprisingly subtle. More yogurt makes
  more gravy. Also a longer cooking time. Vary the amount of chilies to suit
  your taste. This recipe is medium-hot. I hope this satisfies your
  mouth-hunger.  The spice quantities may be varied to suit your preferences.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, though timing matters when cooking the onions.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 1/2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the oil.

      Title: FISH IN HOT FANNY SAUCE
 Categories: Fish, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4 T  Butter, unsalted                    3    Garlic cloves,
      1 t  Cayenne pepper                           -in thin slices
      1 T  Tabasco sauce                       1 T  Pecans, chopped fine
      1 t  Black pepper, ground              1/4 C  Pecans, sliced
      1 t  White pepper, ground                2 t  Lemon juice
      1 t  Paprika                             2    Fish steaks or
      1 t  Oregano                                  -tournedos, cut about
    1/4 C  Onion, minced                            -1 inch thick)
 
  Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet, add onions, garlic, peppers, paprika
  and diced pecans. Cook over medium heat until onions are clear. Add Tabasco
  sauce.
  
  Turn heat to high, add sliced pecans and fish pieces cut about 1 inch
  thick. Cook on high 4-5 minutes per side. Smear uncooked side with sauce
  before turning. Add lemon juice and oregano after turning.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fish in a hot garlic/pecan sauce -- The Cajun Cafe in Portland Oregon
  serves a sauce whose recipe they got under license from K-Paul's in New
  Orleans.  They devoutly refused to answer all of my questions about the
  sauce or its ingredients, so I've tried to formulate it on my own, at home.
  This stuff doesn't taste exactly like what the restaurant serves, but it's
  delicious in its own right.  Maybe it's best to title the recipe "fish with
  something not entirely unlike hot fanny sauce."
  
  This sauce is best served with a moderately strong fish:  I would recommend
  sturgeon, swordfish, or tuna.
  
  *  If you are cooking more pieces of fish than will fit in the skillet at
  once, make the sauce ahead, put it aside (keep warm) and add it before
  cooking each piece of fish.
  
  *  Serve with a simple rice or pasta dish.  I use saffron rice with snow
  peas, or linguine with shrimp meat and pesto.

           Salt                                     -freshly ground
      1 lb Thin spaghetti                      2 T  Parsley, chopped fine
 
  Cut the pancetta or bacon into thin strips.
  
  Put the oil, butter and crushed garlic into a saucepan or small saute pan
  and turn on the heat to medium-high. When the garlic becomes colored a deep
  gold, remove and discard it.
  
  Put the pancetta or bacon into the pan and saute until it begins to be
  crisp at the edges. Add the wine and let it boil away for a minute or two;
  then turn off the heat.
  
  In a large pot, bring about 4-5 quarts water to a boil.  Add about 2-3 T
  salt, and when the water returns to a boil, put in the spaghetti.
  
  Take the bowl from which you'll be serving the spaghetti later, and into it
  break the three eggs.  Beat them lightly, then mix into them both grated
  cheeses, a liberal grinding of pepper, and the parsley.
  
  When the spaghetti is tender but firm to the bite, drain it and put it into
  the serving bowl with the egg-and-cheese mixture.  toss rapidly and
  thoroughly until it is well-coated.
  
  Reheat the pancetta or bacon quickly over high heat, then pour the entire
  contents of the pan over the spaghetti.  Toss again thoroughly and serve
  immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spaghetti with raw eggs and Italian bacon -- While there are innumerable
  minor variations in the way people make this celebrated Roman dish, there
  are really only two substantially different schools of thought. One
  maintains that pancetta, a mild, cured, unsmoked Italian bacon, is the only
  correct bacon to use. The other school insists on the smoked American
  variety. Both are good, and both are popular in Italy, but the version I
  prefer is the one with pancetta. The flavor of smoke is not usually
  associated with Italian food; certainly hardly ever outside of Alto Adige,
  a German-speaking region in the North that was once part of Austria. In
  this dish, I find that smoked bacon adds a sharpness that wearies the
  palate after the first bite-fulls. Try it both ways and decide for
  yourself.

      Title: CURRIED RICE
 Categories: Grains, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 t  Butter                          1 1/2 C  Chicken broth (or
      1 C  Onion, chopped                           -chicken bouillon,
    1/4 t  Garlic, minced                           -or water)
      1 C  Rice                                2    Parsley sprigs
      1 T  Curry powder,                       1    Bay leaf
           -vary to taste                 
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Obtain casserole or heavy ovenproof
  saucepan with a close-fitting lid.
  
  Over a burner on moderate heat, melt half the butter in the casserole and
  cook the onion and garlic, stirring constantly, until the onion is
  translucent.
  
  Add the rice and stir until well-coated with butter.  Add the curry powder
  and stir until well-blended. Add the broth and stir to make sure there are
  no lumps. Add the parsley and bay leaf on top.
  
  Cover and bake in the oven for 17 minutes (Franey says exactly 17 minutes,
  but basically "cook until done.") Discard parsley and bay leaf and stir in
  remaining butter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Baked rice with a mild curry flavor -- This is a slight modification of
  the "Riz a l'Indienne" from the 60-Minute Gourmet (Pierre Franey). It's
  more French than Indian, and goes well with, say, sauteed chicken in cream.
  
  *  This basic recipe may be varied by modifying quantities (for example,
  less onion) or adding ingredients (for example, pine nuts or apple chunks).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 25 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Measure the rice and broth.

  sambal oelek and ketjak benteng manis; mix well. More spices can be added
  to taste.
  
  Drain the noodles.  Add tomato paste and Chinese noodles to cooked mince.
  Mix together. Bring to even heat and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A tasty Indonesian dish -- This is a recipe that my mother, Bep, has
  perfected.  I have no idea where the recipe originated from but it is a
  great dish that she has perfected over the years. The leftovers are great
  next day, hot or cold. Yield: serves 4.
  
  *  Editor's note:  this recipe is unique in the history of alt.gourmand in
  that virtually none of the ingredients is available in an ordinary North
  American grocery store.  However, with a certain amount of difficulty I was
  able to find all of the ingredients in specialty food stores nearby (though
  admittedly I live in a wonderland of ethnic grocery stores and specialty
  markets.) The recipe is so delicious that it's worth including even though
  most readers will not be able to find the ingredients to make it.
  
  North Americans can read ground beef for mince beef and bacon for middle
  bacon.  You can make an interesting substitute for this dish by using
  Mexican seasonings instead of Indonesian; the flavor will not be at all
  authentic but some of the spirit is preserved.

      Title: HAMBURGER PETAL PIE
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 5 servings
 
      1 C  Onion, chopped                      1 t  Salt
      1 C  Green pepper, chopped             1/4 t  Pepper
    1/2    Garlic clove, crushed               1 T  Worcestershire sauce
      2 T  Vegetable oil                       2 T  Flour
  1 1/2 lb Hamburger                           1    Egg, slightly beaten
    1/3 C  Water                               1 lb Biscuits, canned
 
  Saute the onion, green pepper and garlic in the oil until tender then add
  the beef and cook until brown all over. Dump out the grease and add about
  1/3 cup of water. Add the worchestershire sauce, salt, pepper and flour.
  Simmer until the juice thickens.
  
  Separate the biscuits and brush the edges with the egg.  Put the biscuits
  against the sides and bottom of a pie plate so it is completely covered.
  
  Stir the rest of the egg into the meat mixture and then spoon the meat into
  the pie shell.  If you wish you can garnish with a few tomato wedges. Bake
  in a pre-heated oven at 450 degrees F. for about 8 to 10 minutes. The
  biscuits should be slightly browned.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick hamburger dish -- I got this recipe from Judy Halter who got it
  from her sister.  Yield:  serves 5.
  
  *  This gets its name because the biscuits around the edge puff up to look
  like the petals around the center of a sunflower.  This is a great bachelor
  meal because you can come in from work and make it without much effort,
  time or dish washing. You can play with different spices to change the
  flavor. Some of my friends like to put cheese on top before baking it.
  
  *  If you live outside North America, remember that a biscuit is a scone.

      Yield: 3 servings
 
      1 C  Grits, cooked                     1/2 C  Milk
    1/4 lb Butter                              2    Eggs, beaten
    3/4 lb Garlic cheese (process)        
 
  Cook grits according to package directions (typically 20-30 minutes). After
  grits are cooked, stir in butter and cheese.
  
  Cool while adding milk to eggs.  Stir milk and eggs into grits.    Pour
  into a buttered casserole dish. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 45 min to 1
  hour, or until set and browned on top.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A southern U.S. classic; freezes well.  Yield:  Serves 3-4.
  
  *  Don't expect good results with instant grits, use real grits.
  
  *  Editor's note:  grits are ground or cracked hominy.  Hominy is an
  American Indian food, which is made from dried corn. There is virtually no
  substitute for it, and it is hard to get outside North America. It is a
  very popular food in the southern U.S. In parts of Mexico it is known as
  nixtamal or sometimes pozole.

      Title: FRANGO MINT PIE
 Categories: Pies, Usenet
      Yield: 1 pie
 
      1 C  Butter                            3/4 t  Peppermint extract
      2 C  Sugar, confectioner's               2 t  Vanilla extract
           -(sifted)                          10    Vanilla wafers,
      4 oz Chocolate, unsweetened                   -crushed
      4    Eggs                           
 
  Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
  
  In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate.  Add to the butter-sugar
  mixture and beat thoroughly.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well
  after each egg, until well blended. Fold in the peppermint and vanilla.
  
  Line the pie tin with the vanilla wafer crumbs (buttering the pie tin makes
  them stick to the side a little better).  Pour in the filling.  Refrigerate
  for two hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Decadent chocolate mint pie -- One of the things that is memorable about
  Marshall Field's department store in Chicago is their "Frango chocolate
  mints."  This pie captures the flavor perfectly.  I got the recipe from
  Malcolm Slaney, who "found it in a cookbook when [he was] attending Kayak
  School in Oregon."
  
  *  This recipe fills a shallow 8 inch pie tin; add 50 percent to everything
  to fill a 9-inch pie tin.
  
  *  If you're not very good at pie crusts (I'm not), feel free to use a
  pre-formed graham cracker crust.  The chocolate and mint flavors
  predominate, no matter what crust you use.
  
  *  This is serious decadence! The first time I made this, I stopped several
  times in disbelief of just what I was doing.  Enjoy!

  about 1 T sugar and vanilla and spread over pie. Sprinkle with reserved
  crumbs. Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fruit pie made from green seedless grapes -- This recipe came originally
  from the _Los Angeles Times Magazine_.  It's unusual:  I'd never before
  thought of using grapes in a pie before.  But it's good!

      Title: DIRTY SNOWBALLS
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
    1/2 C  Vegetable oil                       2 t  Vanilla
      2 C  Sugar, granulated                   2 t  Baking powder
      4 oz Chocolate, unsweetened              2 C  Flour
      4    Eggs                                1 C  Sugar, powdered
 
  Melt chocolate in double boiler or microwave.  Combine melted chocolate,
  granulated sugar, vanilla and vegetable oil in a mixer.
  
  Add eggs, one at a time, blending well each time.  Sift (or stir) together
  flour and baking powder, add to wet mixture.  Mix well.
  
  Let stand in refrigerator for a few hours or overnight.  Roll dough into
  small balls (no more than about 1 inch in diameter), and roll in powdered
  sugar until coated. Bake for 12 minutes in a preheated 350 degree F. oven.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate cookies with powdered sugar coating -- This recipe was handed
  down to me from my step-sister who got it from her mother.  Yield:  Several
  dozen.
  
  *  The temperature is very important:  any lower and the cookies won't bake
  properly; any higher and the powdered sugar will glaze.
  
  *  If you coat your palms with powdered sugar before attempting to roll the
  balls your hands will get less sticky.  Put the dough back in the
  refrigerator whenever you are not actively using it; it is easier to work
  when cold.
  
  *  You don't actually have to bake these; they make a reasonable fudge when
  left uncooked, but if left in the refrigerator for several days before
  baking they will become dried out. When done, the unused powdered sugar
  will have small shards of chocolate in it; these can be strained out and
  the sugar will be re-usable.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chilling, 20 minutes baking and
  cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: SAUSAGE BALLS
 Categories: Appetizers, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1 lb Bulk sausage, hot                   1 lb Cheddar cheese (sharp),
      3 C  Biscuit mix                              -grated
           -(e.g. Bisquick)               
 
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Grate the cheese.  Combine all the
  ingredients and knead until well mixed.  You may need to add a little beef
  broth to get it to stick together.
  
  Shape into  1-inch balls and place on a cookie sheet or broiler pan.  Bake
  at 375 degrees F. for 25 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spicy snack to be eaten with cocktail sauce -- I got this from my
  sister who got it from my mother. My mother has been cooking it for a long
  time. Serves 10-12 as appetizer.
  
  *  Don't put too many on a cookie sheet or the grease will fill it up and
  run off into your oven. These should be served with cocktail sauce. They
  are very rich. They can be made ahead and frozen until your party, then
  warmed before serving.
  
  *  Cooks outside North America should remember that a biscuit is a scone.
  If you don't have any biscuit mix, you can make some by cutting together
  about 2 1/2 cups of flour, about 4 t baking powder, and about 1/2 cup of
  vegetable shortening or butter.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SUMMER ASPARAGUS SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 T  Butter                              2 t  Salt
      1    Onion, chopped                    1/4 C  Chicken broth, rich
  1 1/2 lb Asparagus, fresh                         -(optional)
      2 T  Flour                               2    Egg yolks
      6 C  Water, boiling                    1/2 C  Milk
 
  Melt the butter in a pan big enough to cook the soup.  Saute the onions for
  a few minutes, until transparent but not brown.
  
  Meanwhile, slice the asparagus into thin slices.  Now add the sliced
  asparagus pieces to the onions and continue to saute (over medium to
  medium-high heat) for 15 minutes, until most of the moisture has steamed
  out of the asparagus and the mixture has just barely started to brown.
  
  Add the flour to the onion/asparagus mixture and stir well to coat each
  piece with some flour. Cook for 2 or 3 more minutes over medium-high heat.
  Dump the boiling water into the asparagus mixture. Add the (optional)
  chicken broth and the salt. Simmer for 1 hour.
  
  Strain out the cooked asparagus, leaving behind a thin yellow-green soup.
  Thicken the soup with the 2 egg yolks.  Add the milk and reheat the soup to
  serving temperature.  Add salt and fresh-ground white pepper to taste.
  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A light and simple asparagus soup -- Every summer, it seems,  the
  grocery stores are glutted with cheap asparagus. Most of the classical
  recipes for asparagus soup produce a hearty winter-style soup. Here's a
  simple recipe for a delicious, light, thin soup that is more in keeping
  with the time of the year that the glut occurs. You can leave out the
  chicken broth to make it a meatless soup, but it does require egg yolks.
  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  The slicing disk on a food processor does an excellent job of slicing
  the asparagus for this recipe. You can use a food mill, a china cap, or an
  ordinary sieve to strain the cooked asparagus out of the broth.
  
  *  Don't try to make this soup as a low-salt soup by leaving out the salt.
   It will taste like dishwater if you cook the asparagus for an hour without
  salt. Don't try to skimp on time by leaving the cooked asparagus in the
  broth unstrained. It will ruin the texture.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate (thickening soup with egg yolks is not a
  beginner's skill).
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour simmering, 5 minutes finishing.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: BLACK FOREST PIE
 Categories: Pies, Usenet
      Yield: 1 pie
 
      1    Pie crust, cooked                   2    Eggs, beaten
    3/4 C  Sugar                           1 1/4 lb Cherry pie filling
    1/3 C  Cocoa, unsweetened                       -(one large can)
      2 T  Flour                               8 oz Whipped cream
    1/4 C  Butter                              1 oz Chocolate (unsweetened),
    1/3 C  Milk                                     -coarsely grated
 
  Prepare your favorite crust for a filled 1-crust pie.  Preheat oven to 350
  degrees F.  In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, cocoa and flour; add
  butter and milk. Cook until mixture begins to boil, stirring constantly.
  Remove from heat.
  
  Add small amount of hot mixture to eggs, mix well, then fold egg mixture
  into the chocolate mixture. Fold 1/3 of the pie filling into chocolate
  mixture; save the rest for the topping. Pour chocolate mixture into pie
  crust. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 35-45 minutes or until center is set but
  still shiny. Cool and chill one hour.
  
  Whip the cream.  Combine 2 cups whipped cream and grated chocolate and
  spread over cooled pie. Top with remaining pie filling and the remaining
  whipped cream. Chill at least half an hour before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich chocolate/cherry pie -- I got this recipe from my mom; I don't
  know where she got it.
  
  *  I use a pre-mixed whipped topping rather than real whipped cream when I
  make this pie.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: ADVOKAAT
 Categories: Drinks, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
  1 1/2 C  Sugar                               9    Egg yolks
      2 T  Vanilla sugar                   1 1/2 C  Grain alcohol
      2 C  Milk                                     -(95-percent)
 
  Mix sugars.  Boil milk with half of sugars for two minutes.  Let it cool
  down. (For the milk it is easiest to use a pot which can later be used with
  a mixer.)
  
  Mix well (mixer at high speed) the yolks with the other half of the sugars.
  Using mixer add to milk.  Then (still using mixer) add alcohol slowly. (The
  result is quite fluid, sweet and strong.)  Bottle and let rest for two
  weeks to let the mixture thicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Egg-cognac:  a potent sweet alcoholic beverage -- Advokaat is the Dutch
  word for egg cognac.  It is highly recommended for A.  I.  (Alcohol
  Imbibing) meetings. This recipe is my modification of a recipe I obtained
  in Poland. It makes a potent, superb advokaat (or egg-cognac). The milk and
  eggs are healthy, the sugar and alcohol are not. Yield: Serves 4-8.
  
  *  This advokaat can be drunk or, better yet, eaten with a spoon; it is
  quite thick.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 2 weeks aging.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

      Title: SPINACH SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    3/4 C  Sugar                             1/4 lb Bacon
      1    Egg                                 2    Eggs, hard-boiled
      1 t  Salt                                     -(or less)
    1/2 C  White vinegar                            Water chestnuts
      1    White onion, chopped                     Sunflower seeds
    1/8 t  Mustard, dry                             Mushrooms
    1/8 t  Worchestershire sauce                    Bean sprouts
      2 lb Spinach                        
 
  Heat in a sauce pan the vinegar, egg, sugar and salt, until just boiling
  and slightly thick. Then add the chopped onion, mustard and Worcestershire
  sauce. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate. When ready to serve, toss the
  remaining ingredients with the dressing.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spinach salad for summertime -- This is one of the scrap pieces of
  paper floating around in my kitchen. I think it came from Kay Dasch. Yield:
  serves 6.
  
  *  You can toss the salad without the dressing and keep it in the
  refrigerator until you are ready to serve it. Don't add the dressing until
  you serve the salad or the spinach will wilt.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation.
  : Precision:  measure the dressing ingredients.

  Grease a souffle dish with butter.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 30 minutes.
  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A classic souffle, flavored with maple syrup -- This recipe was given to
  me by a colleague from the Universite Laval in Quebec, P.Q., Canada. If you
  cannot get maple syrup, try pancake syrup or some fruit liqueur (such as
  Grand Marnier, Fraise des Bois, etc.).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.

-----------------------------------CRUST:-----------------------------------
      6 oz Zwieback cookies                    1 t  Cinnamon
    3/4 C  Sugar                             1/4 lb Butter

-------------------------------CAKE FILLING:-------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Cream cheese                        4    Egg whites
      1 C  Sugar                           1 1/2 t  Vanilla

----------------------------------TOPPING:----------------------------------
      2 C  Sour cream                        1/3 C  Almonds, slivered
      2 T  Sugar                               1 T  Butter
    1/2 t  Vanilla                        
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Use the steel blade of the food processor;
  drop the zwieback cookies into the processor, one at a time, and process

  off excess crust. Enjoy.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Food processor cheesecake -- This is reputedly the 1980 A&S Cheesecake
  contest award winner.  I have an  nth generation copy of the recipe, but it
  is the best cheesecake I have tasted.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.  Precision is required.

      Title: MEXICAN CHEF'S SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken (boneless),               1/4 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -diced                                   -grated
      1 lb Kidney beans                        1 C  Thousand island
    1/2 t  Salt                                     -dressing
      1 t  Chili powder                      1/4 C  Picante sauce
      1 md Onion, chopped                           -(or more or less,
      3 md Tomatoes, diced                          -to taste)
      1 lb Lettuce, chopped                    1 lg Avocado, sliced
           -(about half of                   3/4 lb Corn tortilla chips
           -a large head)                 
 
  Bone and dice the chicken.  Heat a small amount of vegetable oil in a large
  frying pan until it starts to smoke.  Add the chicken cubes and fry over
  medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until they are browned (2 or 3
  minutes).  To the chicken, add the drained kidney beans, salt and chili
  powder.  Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Chop the tomatoes, onion and lettuce.  Grate the cheese.  Toss them
  together in a salad bowl with the salad dressing and picante sauce. Slice
  the avocado and add to the salad. Break the tortilla chips into flakes and
  add to the salad.
  
  Mix the cooked chicken and beans into the cold salad.  Decorate with extra
  chips and slices of avocado and tomato.  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple main-dish salad with Mexican seasonings -- I got this recipe
  from an old roommate, Ann-Marie Tarter. My husband revised it to use
  chicken instead of the hamburger that her version called for. It's a very
  simple, tasty hot-weather main dish. It doesn't keep as leftovers: you have
  to eat all of it immediately or else throw it away. I like to serve it
  accompanied by Aztec soup. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  The chips get soggy within 5 to 10 minutes after the meat has been added
  to the salad, so don't do that step until you are ready to eat.
  
  *  This recipe works best with iceberg lettuce.  The more exotic varieties
  of lettuce wilt instantly when the hot chicken and beans are mixed in;
  iceberg lettuce keeps its crunch.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation.

      Title: ROASTED RED PEPPERS
 Categories: Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Red peppers, fresh                1/4 C  Lemon juice
           -(sweet red capsicum                     Salt
           -peppers)                      
 
  Preheat broiler as hot as you can get it.  Turn red peppers under the
  broiler until their skins come up in black bubbles. Cool the peppers until
  you can handle them comfortably.
  
  Remove the skins, stems, cores and seeds.  (This is messy work.  I have
  tried removing the innards first, before putting the peppers under the
  broiler, and the result is not so good as this way.)
  
  Cut the peppers into finger shapes.  Flavor them with fresh lemon juice and
  salt.  Let them sit for several hours, draining off the liquid that forms.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A low-calorie but flavorful red pepper salad -- Safeway got in their
  first carload of really cheap red peppers yesterday, and I made roasted
  pepper salad.
  
  Serve this at room temperature as a side dish for anything Nicoise or
  Spanish or Greek or Egyptian. Or make a meal of them by adding a bowl of
  yoghurt, a bowl of chopped onion, some black olives, radishes and
  pistachios, and lots of warm pita bread. Or use it with sauteed garlic and
  pitted black olives and a little reduced white wine as a spaghetti sauce.
  Yield:  Serves 4.
  
  *  Now.  Here is the real point about this recipe:  These roasted peppers
  are insanely delicious, smooth and unctuous and aromatic, and yet they
  contain absolutely no calories. A full-sized red pepper is only 15
  calories.
  
  *  Of course I could lose weight if I never ate more than three tablespoons
  of anything. Any fool could do that. But I don't want to confine myself to
  three tablespoons.  Perhaps my taste buds work more slowly that other
  people's.  I don't seem to get the hang of what I'm eating till the second
  serving, or sometimes the third.
  
  *  At the same time, I want things that are really voluptuous and good to
  eat, full of interesting, complicated flavors that will satisfy me and make
  me feel happy and rewarded. Again, any fool could lose weight by eating
  celery stalks and carrots. Unfortunately, any number of carrot sticks over
  six makes me grumpish, and raw celery turns me positively surly in short
  order unless accompanied by delicious, fattening sour cream and cream
  cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, several hours aging.

      Title: MELON BALL SALAD
 Categories: Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3    Melons, in three                  1/4 t  Black pepper
           -different colors                   2 T  Tarragon (fresh),
    1/3 C  Chicken broth                            -minced
    1/4 C  Sherry vinegar                      2 T  Chervil (fresh),
    1/3 C  Lemon juice                              -minced
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed              2 T  Lemon basil, minced
    1/4 t  Salt                           
 
  Cut melons of three different colors into melon balls and drain the balls
  in a colander. Save the juice to make sherbet.
  
  Make a very strong salad dressing of chicken broth, sherry vinegar, lemon
  juice, crushed garlic, salt, pepper and minced fresh tarragon, chervil and
  lemon basil.
  
  Dress the drained melon balls and let the dressing sink in for half an
  hour. Serve with sliced ham and toast.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Margaret's X-rated melon balls -- I had a lettuce and tomato sandwich
  Saturday with mustard instead of mayonnaise.  Better than I would have
  feared. But the big discovery of the week is Margaret's X-rated melon
  balls. Yield: Serves 4.
  
  *  In truth, I have to report that Margaret herself thought the garlic was
  too much; but I didn't.
  
  *  This recipe is not wholly unrelated to fruit curry, another godsend for
  the overplump.

-------------------------------MAITRE'D SAUCE-------------------------------
      3 T  Mustard, dark,                      1 pn White pepper, ground
           -French, coarse-ground              1 T  Vinegar
      1 T  Sugar                               6 T  Olive oil
    1/2 t  Salt                                6 T  Dill
 
  Get a whole fish, clean it and remove the head.  Split into two filets,
  removing the backbone but leave the skin on.  Dry off the filets and remove
  all the little bones.
  
  Crush the peppers and seasonings in a mortar, add the salt and sugar.  Mix
  well and press the mixture into the filets.
  
  In a glass or ceramic dish, put some dill on the bottom, then one of the
  filets, skin side down, then more dill, then the other filet, skin side up.
  Put the thick side of one filet against the other's thin side.  Cover with
  plastic wrap (NOT ALUMINUM FOIL) and put a cutting board or similar on top
  with some weight on it (e.g. a couple of beer cans).
  
  Put it in the refrigerator for a day or so.  (Thin filets are ready in 1
  day, thicker in 2 days.) Turn the filet over once or twice during this
  time. Pour off the brine, otherwise the fish will be too salty. The fish
  will keep for a week in a refrigerator after pouring off the brine.
  
  Make the sauce, Maitre'd sauce.  Mix together the mustard, sugar, salt,
  pepper and vinegar. Add the oil drop by drop as if making a mayonnaise. Add
  the dill. Let the sauce sit for about 10 minutes.
  
  Cut off either thin (nearly horizontal) slices, or thick vertical slices,
  to taste. (Don't cut through the skin). Serve as an appetizer on thin
  slices of buttered rye bread (with a little lemon juice and some finely
  chopped dill), or as a main dish with boiled new potatoes and Maitre'd
  sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Swedish dill-cured salmon -- Gravlax uses a salt-sugar mixture to cure
  the fish. The fish is flavored by dill and whatever else is handy. (I've
  used gin, Julia Child has used cognac).
  
  I've gathered these versions of the recipe from several sources.  From "Ver
  Cokbok" (the Swedish equivalent of "Joy of Cooking" or "Mrs. Beeton.") From
  a brochure published by the Swedish Information Service. From a booklet
  written by Tore Wretman, who owned a major restaurant and has published
  several cookbooks of his own. Gravlax is like barbecue, a process that you
  follow, but can vary considerably.
  
  Don't skimp on the salt.  The proportion of salt to fish is important to
  preserve the fish.  Here are several variations on a single basic recipe.
  Yield:  Serves 3-4.
  
  *  You can broil or grill thick slices of gravlax.  After you've eaten the
  salmon, you can also cut the skin in thin strips, sear them briefly on the
  skin side, and serve them as a garnish.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy once the fish is prepared.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, several days aging.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: PLAIN OLD BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Usenet
      Yield: 2 loaves
 
    1/2 oz Yeast (dry),                    2 1/2 t  Sugar
           -quick-rising                       1 t  Salt
           -(2 envelopes)                  1 3/4 C  Water
    1/4 C  Water, lukewarm                     2 T  Vegetable oil
      7 T  Milk, dry                           6 C  Flour, all-purpose
 
  In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in about 1/4 cup lukewarm water.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, mix the powdered milk, sugar, salt and about 1 3/4
  cups water together.  Stir with a whisk until smooth, then add yeast
  mixture.
  
  Sift in about 3 cups of flour and mix until smooth.  Add the oil; mix.
  
  Gradually sift in the remaining flour.  When it becomes stiff enough to
  handle remove from the bowl and knead it as you add the flour. Knead it for
  5-7 minutes after the last flour is added.
  
  Place the dough in a oiled bowl and turn it over to coat uniformly.  Then
  place it in a warm place to rise until it has doubled in size (about 45
  minutes).
  
  Remove from bowl and knead a little.  Divide into two equal parts, shape
  into loaves, and place in loaf pans. Let rise again until doubled in size.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Bake 45 minutes.  Remove loaves from pans
  and cool on a wire rack.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Ordinary white bread -- This recipe is derived from the basic bread in
  the American Heart Association Cookbook.
  
  *  This is good everyday bread.  Be careful:  it's easy to eat too much and
  get fat.  You may want to have someone who has made bread before help the
  first time as the amount of flour may have to be adjusted depending on the
  slight differences in your measurement of the liquids and the humidity of
  the day. Once you have done it it is easy to do by the feel of the dough.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 2 hours rising, 1 hour cooking and
  cooling.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: SPAGHETTI WITH CLAM SAUCE
 Categories: Pasta, Seafood, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     24 oz Clams (canned), with                8    Garlic cloves, minced
           -juice (2 standard cans)            1 t  Parsley
      8 oz Tomato paste                        1 t  Oregano
           -(1 standard can)                   1 t  Salt
      1 lb Tomatoes (canned),                  1 lb Spaghetti
           -with liquid                        1 T  Cooking oil
      4 T  Butter, clarified                 1/4 C  Parmesan cheese, grated

  Saute the garlic in about 2 T of clarified butter until lightly browned.
  Stir in the clam juice, tomato paste, tomatoes and liquid, parsley and
  oregano. Simmer until reduced by about half. Add the clams and remove from
  heat. This sauce should be reheated just prior to serving.
  
  Cook and drain the spaghetti.  In the empty cooking pot, melt the remaining
  clarified butter, and return the spaghetti to the pot and stir until coated
  uniformly.  Serve with lots of garlic bread and a dry white wine.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Garlic, clam and tomato spaghetti -- This recipe originally appeared in
  "Lowbush Moose (and other Alaskan recipes)" by Gordon R.  Nelson.  I've
  modified it somewhat.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  You can use oil instead of clarified butter, at some sacrifice in
  flavor.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: PHEASANT AMERIND
 Categories: Game, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 lb Pheasant hen, cleaned               4 T  Butter
           -(up to 2 1/2 lb)                   1 pn Thyme, powdered
      1    Onion, quartered                  1/4 t  Rosemary, dried
      1    Bay leaf                                 -and crumbled
      6    Peppercorns                       1/4 C  Mushrooms, chopped
      1 sm Carrot, sliced                      2 T  Flour
      1    Celery stalk, sliced                2 T  Black walnut meats,
      1 t  Salt                                     -finely chopped
 
  COOK BIRDS:  Split pheasant down the breastbone (or have your butcher do
  this).  Rinse the halves, place in a deep pot and barely cover with water.
  Add bay leaf, onion, carrot, celery, salt and peppercorns.
  
  Bring to rolling boil, then turn down heat and simmer for approximately 30
  minutes, or until tender.  Remove foam and scum as it forms.  Remove
  bird(s) from broth, reserving the broth.
  
  Using a heavy skillet, saute the halves in about 2 T of the butter until
  golden.  Place birds into small roasting pan or casserole with just enough
  water to cover the bottom of the pan.  Sprinkle with thyme and rosemary.
  Bake, lightly covered with foil, for 30-40 minutes at 350 degrees F.
  
  MAKE GRAVY:  While the birds are in the oven, strain the broth and boil
  rapidly down to about 2 cups.
  
  Brown the mushrooms using the same skillet in which you browned the
  pheasant. Remove the mushrooms and keep them warm.
  
  Melt the remaining 2 T  of butter in the skillet.  Add the flour, stirring
  up the browning from the pan. Cook over moderately high heat until golden
  brown. Blend in the broth using a wire whisk.
  
  Add mushrooms and continue cooking approximately 1-2 minutes.  Turn down
  heat, cover and keep warm until pheasant is roasted.
  
  When the pheasants are cooked, remove them from the oven and scrape the
  herbs from the skin. After placing the pheasant halves on a warm platter
  (or leaving them in the casserole), pour the gravy over the pheasant.
  Garnish with the chopped nutmeats and serve. This dish is particularly good
  with wild rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pheasant in the North American tradition -- This recipe is adapted from
  the exceptionally good, controlled-circulation Recipes Only Magazine. The
  original dish was created by Mary Richard for use in her Teepee Restaurant,
  in Winnipeg. I found some of the ingredients hard to locate in a hurry and
  used what I had available with good results. You can substitute rock
  Cornish hen, guinea fowl, or chicken for the pheasant and hazelnuts,
  filberts or walnuts for the black walnuts.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy once you have the all the ingredients ready.
  : Time:  40 minutes preparation, 80 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

      Title: LAMB SANS MINT
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Leg of lamb,                        2 C  Olive oil
           -butterflied and                  1/2 C  Lemon juice
           -trimmed                            6    Garlic cloves, sliced
      6 T  Rosemary                            1 T  Oregano
           Black pepper                        1 T  Thyme
           Green onions                        1 C  Onion, minced
      4 C  Burgundy wine                  
 
  Carefully trimming the fat from a butterflied leg of lamb, and and finish
  the cut, as needed, so that the lamb lies flat in a butterfly shape. A
  large butterflied leg of lamb should be no more than about 2 or 3 inches
  thick.
  
  Take a liberal amount of rosemary, crush it and rub it into the lamb.  When
  crushing it, don't turn it into dust, just break it.  Sprinkle some black
  pepper on the cut side of the meat.
  
  Combine the remaining ingredients (wine, green onions, olive oil, lemon
  juice, garlic, oregano, thyme and onion) into a marinade. Place the lamb in
  a shallow dish or bowl, cover as much as possible with the marinade, and
  marinate in a refrigerator, covered, for 4 to 24 hours.  Turn at intervals
  to marinate evenly.
  
  Grill over mesquite and charcoal on a grill with a tight-fitting lid, such
  as a Weber. Cook on one side for 25 minutes, occasionally spooning some
  leftover marinade onto the uncooked side, then turn and cook about 20 more
  minutes. cooking. Make a small cut in the thickest part of the lamb to
  check for doneness: when the center is still pink, but not raw, take the
  lamb off and prepare to serve. Remember that the lamb will continue to cook
  after you take it off the grill.
  
  Serve the lamb cut-side down (pretty side up).  Garnish with uncooked green
  onions.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- I devised this recipe after being
  unable to find an appropriate recipe in the library. It is always well
  received, and it looks impressive far out of proportion to its difficulty.
  Because it is simple and difficult to screw up, it is perfect as the
  centerpiece for a meal with a large group or with complex side dishes.
  Serve with a hearty rice pilaf and a vegetable. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  Your butcher can butterfly a leg of lamb for you.  Tell him you will be
  cooking it flat, and not rolling it back up into a roast.  Ask him to be
  careful.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have a good butcher.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 45 minutes roasting.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: MARINATED LAMB
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 C  Red wine                            1 T  Black pepper, fresh
    1/2 C  Soy sauce (up                       4    Garlic cloves, crushed
           -to 3/4 C)                          1    Half leg of lamb,
      1 T  Rosemary leaves,                         -butterflied
           -crushed                       
 
  Mix together all of the ingredients except the lamb.  Place the lamb in a
  bowl or pan that will not be corroded by the marinade (a glass 9x13 pan
  works well).
  
  Pour most of the marinade over the lamb.  Swish the lamb around and get it
  soaked on both sides.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least
  several hours, turning occasionally.
  
  Start a fire in the grill and get the coals very warm but not flaming.
  Place lamb on grill about 3-4 inches from the coals. Cook on this side for
  20 minutes, basting with the extra marinade occasionally. Turn the meat
  over and cook another 20 minutes.
  
  After 10 minutes on the second side, start checking for doneness. Contrary
  to many people's ideas, lamb should not be well done but should still be a
  little pink. When done, slice thin and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- This is the best recipe I have ever
  had for lamb. It really brings out the flavor wonderfully. It came
  originally from the "Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook."
  
  A wonderful side dish for this is the Spanish recipe for Garlic fried
  potatoes.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  For the meat, you need a half leg of lamb which has been butterflied.  A
  good butcher can do this for you but don't be afraid of trying it yourself.
  To butterfly the leg, take a sharp knife and start at the side and work
  towards the bone.  Once you have found the bone, work along it so you have
  one side completely slit and then cut out the bone. Depending on which end
  of the leg you have, you may need to puzzle over some of the weirdnesses of
  the bone shape. Don't discard the bone, it makes interesting soup.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 40 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      1 t  Mustard, dry                   
 
  Mix together all of the ingredients except the lamb.  Place the lamb in a
  bowl or pan that will not be corroded by the marinade (a glass 9x13 pan
  works well). Pour the marinade over the lamb. Cover and marinate in the
  refrigerator for 12 hours, turning occasionally.
  
  Start a fire in the grill and get the coals very warm but not flaming.
  Place lamb on grill about 3-4 inches from the coals. Cook 20 minutes on
  each side.
  
  After 10 minutes on the second side, start checking for doneness. Contrary
  to many people's ideas, lamb should not be well done but should still be a
  little pink. When done, slice thin and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- This recipe is the same as Anita
  Cochran's recipe for grilled butterflied leg of lamb, except that it uses a
  different marinade.  I got the marinade recipe from a local wine merchant.
  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  This marinade also works well with chicken.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 40 minutes cooking.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Filipino cabbage in garlic and soy sauce -- I got this from Lynne
  Fitzsimmons who got it from a Filipino friend of her mother's.
  
  *  You will need a big frying pan to fit all the ingredients.  You may
  leave out the salt and MSG if you like. I have successfully used
  lightly-microwaved bacon as the meat.

      Title: BRIAMI
 Categories: Casseroles, Greek, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Eggplant                            1 C  Olive oil
      2 lb Zucchini                            4 md Tomatoes
      4 md Potatoes                            2    Garlic cloves
      2    Green peppers                       1 t  Sugar
      1    Red pepper                               Salt and pepper,
      2 md Onions                                   -to taste
 
  Prepare the vegetables:  Cut the eggplant, zucchini and potatoes in bite
  sized chunks (do not peel the zucchini or the eggplant). Remove the stems
  and seeds from the peppers and slice them into strips. Peel and slice the
  onions. Dice the tomatoes.
  
  Saute the vegetables except the tomatoes in the olive oil in small batches.
  Saute each batch for 2 or 3 minutes, then remove from the pan, trying to
  drain some of the oil so that enough oil is left for the next batch. When
  you're done, most (if not all) of the oil should be gone from the pan.
  Place the sauteed vegetables in a baking dish and toss them briefly so that
  you won't get only one kind of vegetable in one place.
  
  Add the tomatoes into the pan and saute for a couple of minutes.  Crush the
  garlic and add to the tomatoes.  Add the sugar, salt and pepper to taste
  and simmer for another minute. Pour the tomato sauce on top of the
  vegetables and bake at 350 degrees F. or until the vegetables are tender.
  
  Serve with plenty of fresh bread and, if you like, some feta cheese on the
  side.

  from Greece. I got the recipe out of a Greek cookbook.

      Title: BACON POTATO PIE
 Categories: Casseroles, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Bacon, thick-sliced                 1 lb Baking potatoes
           -and lean                         1/2 lb Cheddar cheese
      1    Onion                               8    Eggs
 
  Cut the bacon slices into square pieces.  Fry the pieces until well-cooked,
  then drain on paper towels.
  
  Peel the potatoes, then grate them.  To prevent the grated potatoes from
  discoloring while you prepare the other ingredients, you can put them into
  a bowl of cold water. When you're ready to use them, be sure to drain well
  and squeeze them dry.
  
  Grate the cheese.  Mince the onion.  Butter a 9x13 inch shallow baking
  dish. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Beat the eggs in a large bowl.  Add all the other ingredients and stir.
  Pour the mixture into the baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for
  about 45 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked. Serve hot, warm or at room
  temperature.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A brunch casserole with potatoes, eggs, bacon and cheese -- This is a
  very easy brunch dish, similar to a fritatta in texture, but full of
  traditional breakfast ingredients. The recipe comes from a cookbook
  published by the _Contra Costa (California) Times_ newspaper, called
  "Tastes of the Times." Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  It really does make a difference if you use good meaty bacon for this. I
  find the best bacon at my local butcher shop.
  
  *  You can prepare part of this ahead.  I think egg dishes are better if
  they haven't been refrigerated. So if you want to work ahead, you can cook
  the bacon, grate the cheese and potatoes and mince the onion the night
  before. Store all these things separately in the refrigerator, covering the
  potatoes with water. Then in the morning just mix it all up and bake it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (tedious).
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: BOB'S BUFFET BISCUITS
 Categories: Biscuits, Usenet
      Yield: 2 dozen
 
     40 oz Biscuit mix                       1/3 C  Green onions, chopped
           -(e.g. 1 box of Bisquick)           2    Eggs, slightly beaten
    3/4 C  Parmesan cheese, grated             2 C  Milk
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a big bowl mix the biscuit mix, onions,
  eggs, milk and about 1/2 cup of the cheese.
  
  Put the dough into a  9x13 inch baking pan and smooth it down.  You will
  have to flour your hand or spatula to do this. Sprinkle the rest of the
  cheese over the top and then use the spatula or knife to score the dough
  into square biscuits. Cut all the way to the pan.
  
  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 40 to 45 minutes.  When they
  are done a wooden toothpick stuck into the dough will come out clean.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Some not-so-plain biscuits -- This recipe is from Bob Clover of
  Sausalito, California and was first published in _Sunset_ magazine. Yield:
  24-30 biscuits.
  
  *  When you take them out of the oven, flip the pan upside down over a rack
  to get the biscuits out, then flip the rack over to get everything back
  right side up again.
  
  *  This is good if you are having a lot of company or want a lot of
  leftovers.

 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 T  Butter, unsalted                    1 C  Cream, heavy
      1 sm Onion, chopped                      1 t  Salt
      1 t  Rosemary                          1/2 t  White pepper,
      1 sm Butternut squash,                        -freshly ground
           -peeled and cut                          Hot pepper sauce
           -into chunks                      1/2 C  Chopped walnuts,
      6 C  Chicken stock                            -toasted
 
  Melt the butter over moderate heat in a large, heavy saucepan.  Add the
  onion and rosemary. Cook for about 5 minutes until the onion is soft. Add
  the squash, chicken stock, cream, salt, pepper and hot pepper sauce. Reduce
  the heat and cover. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 2 hours until
  the squash is very soft.
  
  Use a food processor or blender to puree the hot soup.  Add additional
  stock if the soup is too thick.
  
  Toast and chop the walnuts.  Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the
  walnuts.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Makes a meal with cheese, bread and red wine -- Here is a rich soup
  which is easy to make and popular with guests. I like this best with
  cheese, bread and red wine as a winter meal, but you can serve it as a
  first course.  The original recipe came from _Food & Wine_ magazine a
  couple of years ago.
  
  *  As a variation, you may chop some or all of the walnuts in the food
  processor or blender while the soup is pureed.  This will give the soup a
  slightly different taste and texture.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the hot pepper sauce.

      1 C  Applesauce                
 
  Place the candy and water in a pot.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve
  the candy. Add jello powder and stir until it is dissolved.
  
  Stir in applesauce and ice cubes until ice cubes are melted.  Pour into a
  bowl and refrigerate until set (1 hour or more).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Applesauce jello salad -- A delicious jello salad, taken from The
  Monterey Coast Guard Officers' Wives Club Cookbook. My sister-in-law was
  the president of the club which put that cookbook together.
  
  *  Substituting apple cider or apple juice for the water adds tremendous
  taste.  We prefer homemade chunky style applesauce to processed commercial
  brands.

      Title: SWEET POTATO & CRANBERRY QUICHE
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 lb Sweet potatoes                    1/2 lb Cream cheese
    1/2 lb Carrots                             1 ds Nutmeg
    1/2 lb Cranberries                         1 ds Salt
    2/3 C  Sugar                               1    Quiche shell,
    1/2 C  Milk                                     -pre-baked
      4    Eggs                                     -(about 11 inches)
 
  Start some salted water boiling.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Peel and
  grate the sweet potatoes.  Grate carrots.  Put these vegetables into an
  empty saucepan. Pour the boiling water over the saucepan full of vegetables
  and bring to a boil. Cook five minutes; drain.
  
  Wash cranberries and pick out the ones that are soft or blemished.  Put the
  cranberries in an enameled pot with the sugar and cook them, covered, over
  low heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the lid and cook for
  five minutes more, stirring almost constantly.
  
  Add cooked drained potato/carrot mixture to cranberries and cook for 3 to 4
  minutes more, stirring constantly.
  
  Beat together the milk, eggs, cream cheese, a little nutmeg and a dash of
  salt.  Stir in the cooked vegetable mixture and pour this filling carefully
  into the prepared shell.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 40 minutes or until
  the top is golden and firm. Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sweet potatoes, carrots and cranberries in cream cheese quiche -- This
  recipe has become a real holiday favorite in our family.  It is originally
  from "The Vegetarian Epicure, Book Two" by Anna Thomas.  It is sweeter than
  most quiches, but not as sweet as most pies, and can be eaten either as a
  side dish, or as dessert. We usually eat it with the turkey because no one
  wants to wait until dessert time!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  25 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.

      Title: CHERNOBYL-CHILI
 Categories: Entrees, Microwave, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      4 lb Beef, ground                        2 T  Brown sugar
      3 lg Onions, diced                       3 T  Sugar, white
    1/2 C  Green pepper, diced                 4 T  Chili powder
      6    Garlic cloves, pressed              2 t  MSG (monosodium glutamate)
      2 lb Tomatoes, crushed                   2 t  Red pepper (cayenne),
           -(use standard canned                    -crushed
           -tomatoes)                          1 t  Black pepper, ground
      1 lb Tomatoes, whole,                    1 t  Salt
           -cut up (canned or fresh)           3 T  Bacon grease
      6 oz Tomato paste                             Water or beer,
  2 1/2 lb Kidney beans (light red),                -as needed
           -not drained                             Garlic powder,
           -(3 standard-size cans)                  -as needed
 
  In a large microwave container, brown meat, onions, green pepper and garlic
  for 15 minutes on full power.  Drain off and reserve a cup or two of
  liquid. Break up any remaining large chunks of meat.
  
  Add remaining ingredients except tomato paste and cook on full power for 30
  minutes covered.  Stir and taste.  Cook for 1 hour at 70 percent power,
  uncovered.  Stir and taste at half hour intervals.  Add water as necessary.
  
  Add tomato paste and reserved meat liquid.  Cook 30 minutes at 60 percent
  power, uncovered.  Stir and taste.  The chili is done and can be served
  directly or decanted into a crock pot to simmer.
  
  Serve with shredded cheddar cheese, tabasco sauce, diced onions, hot chili
  oil, red pepper flakes and hot dogs with rolls.  Your guests can microwave
  their own hot dogs and top them with chili and cheese!!!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  High-energy microwave chili -- Microwaves and chili make a superb match,
  especially for lazy chili lovers like me.  This version is for a mixed
  crowd. True chili fiends should see the notes at the end. Yield: Serves
  8-12.
  
  *  For true CHERNOBYL-Class 20 megaton SS-19 chili, double the pepper,
  chili powder and MSG and add 30 minutes to the cooking. Serve with Pepski.
  
  *  People who are worried about MSG, bacon grease or radiation should not
  be eating chili in the first place.
  
  *  Yes, it will make an incredible mess in your microwave oven.
  
  *  The most likely things you will need to add at the testing points are
  salt, sugar, and maybe garlic powder.
  
  *  The chili will thicken up in the microwave so be sure to add enough
  water to keep it soupy until the last phase.

      Title: CHRISTMAS/THANKSGIVING STUFFING
 Categories: Entrees, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
    1/2 lb Beef, ground                      1/2 C  Pine nuts
      2 T  Butter                            1/2 C  Almonds (blanched),
      1 t  Salt                                     -whole
    1/2 C  White rice, raw                    10    Prunes, pitted
      1    Poultry liver                     1/2 C  Raisins
           -(from the bird you                10    Chestnuts (up to 15)
           -are going to stuff)           
 
  Cook the chestnuts:  Cut a groove on each chestnut and roast them on the
  stove (if you've got an electric stove, placing the chestnuts on the burner
  will do the trick, though you'll have to do some cleaning afterwards.) When
  they're done, peel them. Watch your hands.
  
  Brown the beef with half the butter.  Add the rice, salt and a little
  water, and let it cook on low heat, until the water is absorbed.
  
  Boil the liver, mince it and add it into the rice and meat.  Add the
  almonds, prunes, raisins, chestnuts (cut in chunks) and pine nuts. Add a
  small amount of water and let everything simmer until the water is
  absorbed.
  
  The stuffing is ready to use.  Add the remaining butter and bake it.  I
  usually wrap the stuffing in aluminum foil, put it in a separate pan and
  bake it along with the chicken. When the chicken is ready, the stuffing is
  ready too!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Holiday stuffing with fruit and nuts -- This is an elaborate version of
  the type of poultry stuffing made in Greece. People there have never heard
  of bread stuffings and, once you taste this recipe, you'll never want to
  hear about bread stuffings either! I got the recipe from my mother, who got
  it from a friend, who got it from her sister-in-law, who... Yield: stuffs
  5-6 lb poultry.
  
  *  If the chestnut-roasting procedure is to messy for you, then just boil
  them.
  
  *  The amounts in the ingredients list are there for completeness' sake.
  You should really interpret them as a few, a handful or one small package.
  The only thing you have to bear in mind is that putting more prunes will
  make the stuffing sourer, and putting more raisins will make it sweeter.
  
  *  The original recipe suggested using unpitted prunes.  I believe that
  using pitted prunes is safer for the teeth!

    1/4 lb Butter                            1/2 lb Tomatoes, diced
 
  In a large casserole, saute onions and garlic over medium heat in butter
  until onions are soft. Brown chicken pieces in the butter and remove from
  pot as they are done.
  
  When all chicken pieces are browned, turn up heat, add vermouth and brandy
  to pot and stir until bubbling.
  
  Turn heat down to low, add cinnamon, tomato paste and pepper, and stir
  until mixed. Add chicken back to pot and add tomatoes. Cook over very low
  heat for at least 2 hours, until chicken is tender.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken with tomatoes and cinnamon.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  *  Vary the seasonings to taste by leaving out the garlic or doubling it,
  or by increasing or decreasing the amount of cayenne pepper. You can use
  crushed red pepper flakes in place of the cayenne.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours simmering.
  : Precision:  no need to measure, except the cayenne pepper.

      Title: CHICKEN MILANAISE
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Chicken                             1 T  Lemon juice
      1 T  Salt                                2 C  Rice, white (to serve
      3 T  Butter, unsalted                         -on the side)
      3 T  Flour                                    Salt and pepper
      2    Egg yolks                                -(for the sauce)
 
  Place the chicken in a pot.  Cover it with water, add the salt and bring it
  to a boil, skimming any scum that may form on the surface. Turn down the
  heat, cover the pot and cook the chicken for about 1 hour or until it is
  done.
  
  Remove the chicken from the pot.  Skim and discard the chicken fat from the
  surface of the broth.  Reserve about 2 cups of broth for the sauce and use
  the remaining broth to cook the rice according to standard procedures for
  cooking rice.
  
  While the rice is cooking, make the sauce:  melt the butter under low heat
  in a saucepan and add in the flour, salt and pepper. Stir until you get a
  uniform mixture and then add the reserved broth gradually, stirring
  constantly.  When the mixture thickens, remove from the heat.
  
  Beat the egg yolks with the lemon juice and add them into the sauce.  Stir
  the sauce until the egg yolks are completely blended. The sauce is ready.
  Cut the chicken and serve with sauce on both the chicken and the rice.
  
  Chicken with white sauce -- This is what my mother serves as Chicken
  Milanaise.  I once ordered Chicken Milanaise at a restaurant, and they
  served me an entirely different dish, so I'm not sure as to whether I'm
  using the name properly. In any case, this recipe is one of my favourites!
  Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  You are supposed to use white pepper in the sauce but, since I don't
  mind seeing a few black specs in the sauce, I always use black pepper.
  
  *  If you are going to reheat the sauce, make sure that it doesn't come to
  a boil, otherwise the egg will separate.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.
  : Time:  About 1 1/2 hours.
  : Precision:  Measure the sauce ingredients.

      Title: PUMPKIN CHEESE SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Pumpkin (big enough                 1    Garlic clove, minced
           -to hold 6-10                     1/4 t  Salt
           -servings of soup)                1/4 t  Pepper
      2 T  Butter, melted                    1/4 t  Nutmeg
      2 T  Butter                            3/4 C  Cream, light
      1 lg Onion, chopped                      1 C  Cheddar or gruyere
      2 lg Carrots, shredded                        -cheese, grated
      2    Celery sticks, chopped            1/3 C  White wine, dry
      4 C  Vegetable broth                     2 T  Parsley, minced
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Butter a baking sheet.
  
  Prepare pumpkin:  cut off the top, scoop out seeds, brush inside with about
  2 T melted butter. Replace top and place pumpkin on baking sheet. Bake 45
  mins or until tender when pierced with a fork. The pumpkin should be a bit
  droopy but still hold its shape well.
  
  Meanwhile, melt about 2 T butter in a big saucepan.  Add onion, carrots,
  celery.  Saute until soft, about 10 mins.  Add broth, garlic, salt, pepper
  and nutmeg. Cover and simmer 20 minutes. Cool slightly.
  
  Puree vegetable mixture in 2 or 3 batches in a blender or food processor.
  Put back in saucepan; stir in the cream. Reheat. Add cheese and wine, heat
  until cheese melts. Stir frequently after adding milk to avoid scorching.
  Place hot pumpkin on serving platter.  Pour in soup.  Sprinkle with
  parsley.
  
  Serve the soup by ladling out of the pumpkin at the table, scooping a
  little bit of pumpkin into each serving. The pumpkin then makes a great
  centerpiece for your table, while allowing people to have second helpings.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cheese soup in a pumpkin shell -- This recipe came from the 1983 Half
  Moon Bay Pumpkin Festival and was published in our local newspaper in 1984.
  
  *  I use half gruyere and half cheddar.  Shred the cheeses very finely so
  they will melt rapidly. After the soup is all gone, the pumpkin can be cut
  up, washed, and used in pumpkin pie. It may need more baking to become soft
  enough to puree for the pies.
  
  *  It was impossible to find pumpkins after Halloween near San Francisco,
  but fortunately they keep for a month until Thanksgiving in a cool area if
  left uncut.
  
  *  In North America, light cream is often called half and half.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: EASY CARROTS AU GRATIN
 Categories: Vegetables, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 T  Butter                              3 T  Flour
      3 C  Carrots, sliced                 1 1/2 C  Milk
      3 T  Butter                            1/2 lb Cheese (processed)
 
  Slice the carrots and saute in about 1 T butter over low heat for 5-10
  minutes, until cooked to taste.
  
  Make a roux with the butter and flour.  Add the milk (warmed) and cook
  until thick. Add cheese and cook until cheese is melted. Mix in the cooked
  carrots.
  
  Place in greased casserole and sprinkle with buttered bread crumbs.  Bake
  at 350 degrees F. for 15-20 minutes or until brown.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple and unusual carrot-cheese casserole -- This is a family recipe
  that my in-laws make for holiday dinners.  I've never seen it in any
  cookbook. It's unusual, but good. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  Process cheese is sometimes called American cheese or Canadian cheese
  depending on where it is bought.  You can make a standard cheddar cheese
  sauce instead, or you can use something like Velveeta instead.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  2 1/2 lb Butternut squash                    1 T  Butter
           -(up to 5 lb)                       2    Eggs, beaten
      1    Carrot (2 if use                         -frothy
           -more squash)                       1 pn Salt
      1 C  Rolled oats                         5 T  Cinnamon sugar
           -(uncooked oatmeal)                      -(or less)
     12 oz Green peas                        1/2 t  Vanilla
 
  Boil squash and carrot together until the carrot is tender.  Allow both to
  cool.  Slide skin off carrot.  Being careful with squash, remove its seeds
  and peel. Blend carrots and squash together. Don't over-blend: preserve
  some texture. Add cinnamon sugar and salt to taste.
  
  Add frothy eggs to carrot/squash mixture.  Grease an 8-inch loaf pan.  Coat
  the grease with oatmeal.  Mix about 1/2 cup oatmeal into casserole.  Gently
  fold in green peas, then put mixture in casserole pan.  Sprinkle remaining
  oatmeal on top and dot with butter.  Bake at 350 degrees F. 30 to 40
  minutes until brown on top. Once cooked, it can be served immediately or
  frozen for later consumption.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Butternut squash and carrot casserole -- A delicious Thanksgiving or
  Christmas casserole.  My mother makes this at the holidays.  I don't know
  where she originally got the recipe.  Yield:  Serves 10.
  
  *  Cinnamon sugar is a mixture of sugar and powdered cinnamon.  Commercial
  cinnamon sugar mixtures are mostly sugar.  My mom prepares her own mixture
  with the emphasis decidedly on the cinnamon.

      Title: BROWNIES
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      8 oz Chocolate, unsweetened              1 T  Vanilla extract
           -(8 squares)                    1 1/2 C  Flour
    1/2 lb Butter                              2 C  Walnuts, coarsely
      5    Eggs                                     -chopped (optional)
  2 1/2 C  Sugar                          
 
  Grease a 13x9 inch pan and pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Melt the
  chocolate and the butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering
  water.  Whisk until smooth. Set aside to cool while beating eggs.
  
  Beat the eggs, sugar and vanilla at high speed for a full 10 minutes. Blend
  in the chocolate-and-butter mixture at low speed.  Add flour, beating just
  to blend. Stir in walnuts, if desired.
  
  Bake 30 to 35 minutes.  Do not overbake.  The brownies are done when a
  toothpick inserted into the center comes out slightly dirty.  Cool in pan,
  then cut into squares.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Serious chocolate brownies -- This is an adaptation of the "Scrumptious
  Brownies" recipe found on a box of Baker's unsweetened chocolate.  I've
  reduced the amounts of sugar and flour from the original, which I find
  makes for a very fudgey brownie. Yield: 32 brownies.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking and cooling.

           -into half-rings               
 
  Grind cumin seeds, black pepper, cardamom seeds, cinnamon, black mustard
  seeds and fenugreek seeds together in a spice grinder. In a small bowl,
  combine ground spices, vinegar, salt, cayenne pepper and brown sugar. Set
  aside.
  
  Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat.  Fry onions, stirring
  frequently, until they are a rich, dark brown. Remove onions with a slotted
  spoon and put them in a blender. Turn off the heat, but do not discard the
  oil.  Add about 3 T water (or more if necessary) to the onions and blend
  until you have a smooth paste. Add this onion paste to the spices in the
  bowl.  This mixture is the vindaloo paste.
  
  Put the ginger and garlic in a blender.  Add about 3 T water and blend
  until you have a smooth paste.
  
  Heat the remaining oil in the saucepan over medium heat.  When hot, add the
  ginger, garlic paste.  Stir until the paste browns slightly.  Add the
  coriander and turmeric.  Stir a few seconds.  Add the chicken, a little at
  a time, and brown lightly.
  
  Add the vindaloo paste, tomato sauce and potatoes to the chicken in the
  saucepan.  Stir and bring to a slight boil.  Cover the saucepan, reduce
  heat to low and simmer for about an hour, or until potatoes are tender.
  Serve over rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spicy chicken curry -- Nearly every Indian restaurant serves something
  that it calls Chicken Vindaloo, but the dish varies greatly from place to
  place. This recipe is a modification of a vindaloo recipe that appears in
  Madhur Jaffrey's "Indian Cooking" (Barron's 1983). I've attempted to
  approximate the Chicken Vindaloo served at The Tandoor Palace on Second
  Avenue in New York. Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  Don't undercook the onions.  They should be cooked until dark brown.  If
  the onion paste turns out gray rather than brown, then the onions were not
  cooked enough.
  
  *  This dish is very, very hot.  It may not seem so at first, but the
  spices have a cumulative effect that builds up over the course of the meal.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 to 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: FRED'S MUSKRAT
 Categories: Game, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Muskrats (all fat                 1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
           -and glands removed)                     Salt
    1/2 lb Bacon                                    Pepper
    1/2    Celery bunch, chopped              21 oz Tomato soup
      4    Onions, chopped                          -(2 standard cans)
    1/2 lb Oleo                           
 
  Saute bacon, celery, onions, oleo and cayenne pepper together for 10
  minutes.
  
  Put rats in bottom of a pan you can cover tightly (my mother makes a double
  batch and uses the roaster she cooks turkey in).  Pour sauteed mixture over
  the rats, and then cover with tomato soup.  (Don't add water to the soup.)
  
  Bake, covered, for 2 1/2 hours at 350 degrees F or until done.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Muskrat roasted in tomato sauce -- In northwestern Ohio and downriver
  Detroit, we have "muskrat suppers" in the winter, sponsored by churches and
  volunteer fire departments to raise money, rather the way other people have
  chicken and ham dinners.  This recipe comes from Fred Witty, via the
  cookbook put out by my parents' church.
  
  Legend has it that during the depression, the Bishop of Detroit declared
  muskrats to be fish (since they live in the water), so they could be eaten
  by Catholics on Fridays.
  
  *  Muskrats are small rodents that live in swamp and build beaver-like
  houses out of cat-tails and mud. In New Jersey and Ohio, at least, they are
  trapped for their fur; I suspect that knowing a trapper is the only way you
  can get muskrats.
  
  *  The recipe book I have has a recipe for muskrats for a crowd, that (for
  20 rats) uses the above ingredients (but quantities unspecified, except it
  only uses about 1/4 lb oleo), plus chopped green and red peppers, garlic
  salt, 5 bouillon cubes and 3 bay leaves. Around Detroit, muskrats are
  cooked with cabbage and potatoes, and some folks at home roast them with
  apples and onions.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy once you have the muskrats.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  count the muskrats.

      4 C  Chicken broth                     1/2 C  Fresh mint leaves,
      1 C  Wild rice, rinsed well                   -chopped
  1 3/4 C  Wheat pilaf                              Zest of 2 oranges,
      1 C  Pecan halves                             -grated
      1 C  Currants, dried                     2 T  Olive oil
      1    Scallion bunch,                     1 T  Orange juice
           -thinly sliced                           Black pepper,
    1/2 C  Italian parsley,                         -freshly ground
           -chopped                       
 
  In a medium saucepan, bring broth to a boil.  Add wild rice to boiling
  broth. Bring back to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, covered,
  for 50 minutes or until rice is tender. Do not overcook. Remove to a large
  bowl.
  
  While the rice is cooking, in another saucepan bring about 2 1/4 cups water
  to a boil. Stir in the pilaf, cover and bring back to a boil. Reduce heat
  to low and simmer 15 minutes, or until pilaf is tender. Remove from heat,
  let rest 15 minutes, and add to the (cooked) wild rice. Add remaining
  ingredients and toss well. Serve at room temperature.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Wheat and wild rice pilaf with pecans -- I originally got this recipe
  from the Sunday magazine of the local paper, I served it last year for
  Christmas dinner, and it's very good.

      Title: SPICY KEBABS
 Categories: Meats, Barbecue, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      2 lb Pork or lamb                        1 t  Cumin, ground
           -(boneless), lean, cut            1/2 t  Pepper
           -into 1 1/2 inch cubes              4    Onions
    1/4 C  Peanut butter, smooth               1    Garlic clove, minced
      1 t  Coriander, ground               1 1/2 t  Lemon juice
  1 1/2 t  Salt                                1 T  Brown sugar
    1/2 t  Cayenne pepper (or more,            1 T  Soy sauce
           -to taste)                     
 
  Grate the onions.  This is best done using a food processor.  Mincing is
  not good enough; you want to end up with something wet and mushy. Don't
  stick your nose into the food processor.
  
  Put all the ingredients into a large bowl, mix well, and cover. Refrigerate
  for several hours, mixing occasionally.
  
  Put meat cubes on skewers, keeping as much of the onion mixture on them as
  you can. Grill over hot coals, turning to brown each side, for 20 to 25
  minutes or until meat is cooked through. (Lamb should still be slightly
  pink; pork should not.)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spicy pork or lamb kebabs -- I copied this from a newspaper or magazine
  a long time ago; I forget where. It was originally for pork, but it's good
  with lamb, too.
  
  *  You could probably put some vegetables (onions, bell peppers) on the
  skewers between the meat chunks; watch out that the veggies don't burn.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, several hours marinating, 30 minutes
  cooking.

      Title: MOLDED CRANBERRY RELISH
 Categories: Relishes, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
----------------------------------DRESSING----------------------------------
      2 C  Marshmallow creme                   3 oz Cream cheese
      1 C  Heavy whipping cream          

-----------------------------------RELISH-----------------------------------
     10 oz Cranberries, fresh                  1 C  Tokay grapes
    3/4 C  Water                                    -(quartered and seeded)
      6 oz Raspberry Jello mix             2 1/2 C  Pineapple (canned),
           -(1 package)                             -crushed, including
    1/4 C  Sugar, granulated                        -syrup (one #2 can)
      1 C  Celery, chopped fine                   
 
  MAKE DRESSING:  The night before serving the relish, place the cream cheese
  and marshmallow creme in a small bowl.  Mash lightly with a fork to barely
  break up cream cheese.  Add whipping cream and cover tightly.  Refrigerate
  overnight.
  
  15 minutes before serving, whip mixture with an electric mixer until it
  reaches the consistency of thick, but not stiff, whipped cream.
  
  MAKE RELISH:  Rinse cranberries thoroughly.  Place in an 8-cup saucepan
  with water and cover. Bring to a boil and cook until the berries have
  "popped." Remove from heat and, using an electric mixer, beat gently until
  all the berries are broken. Add Jello and sugar. Place saucepan over a bowl
  of ice and stir occasionally until mixture has thickened but not jelled.
  
  Add grapes, celery and crushed pineapple (including packing syrup).  Pour
  into prepared mold and chill in refrigerator until set (about 3 hours).
  
  To serve, unmold relish onto a plate and place dressing in a separate dish.
  Serve a couple of dollops of dressing with each serving of relish.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  For years my mother required us to taste her ever-changing version of a
  fresh cranberry relish she insisted serving at Thanksgiving and Christmas.
  The unanimous family response to the inevitably bitter dish was, "Do we
  have to?" Then one year a friend came to Thanksgiving dinner and
  contributed what is now known simply as "the recipe." Mom never tried to
  improve on this addictive relish. Yield: Serves 8-10.
  
  *  The most difficult step is in unmolding the relish.  I always spray my
  mold very lightly with a coating of an aerosol cooking oil (such as "PAM")
  before filling it with the relish. When it's time to unmold, I run a thin
  spatula around the outside of the molded relish to barely loosen it, place
  the serving plate on top and invert the mold and plate. I rarely have to
  dip the mold in hot water to loosen the relish.
  
  *  I usually use a standard ring mold and put the dressing in a footed
  compote which sits in the center of the unmolded ring of relish.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, overnight chilling, 30 more minutes
  preparation.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SOAP, part 1 of 2
 Categories: Usenet
      Yield: 6 pounds
 
      9 lb Suet (also called                   2 C  Lemon juice
           -tallow or beef fat)              1/4 oz Volatile fragrance
      1 pk Lye (see note)                           -oil (optional; see note)
      3 C  Water                          
 
  TOOLS YOU WILL NEED:  1)  A large pot (metal or ceramic) -- at least 2
  gallons -- with a lid (for rendering the fat). 2) One long wooden spoon --
  at least 10 inches -- that you can sacrifice, because the lye will eat away
  the wood. 3) A large ceramic (or glass) bowl capable of holding all the
  water, lemon juice and fat, with some room to spare. (I use a ceramic tub
  that is about 6 inches high and 24 inches in diameter; do not use metal, as
  it will corrode. Even stainless steel will corrode.) 4) Finally, you will
  need some glass, ceramic and/or wooden molds to pour the soap into. (I use
  glass baking dishes; two 8 1/2 x 14-inch glass pans will make bars of soap
  that are about 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick. Again, DO NOT USE METAL CONTAINERS,
  as they will corrode.)
  
  STEP 1:  Render the fat.  To do this, cut the fat into hand-sized pieces
  and place in a large pot and cover it. Heat on medium until all the fat is
  melted.  You should stir it occasionally.  You should probably plan to turn
  the fan on high or open your kitchen windows while you are doing this.
  (Note that if you are starting with a pure fat, such as coconut oil or
  olive oil, you don't need to do this. Skip to Step 4.)
  
  STEP 2:  Cool the fat so that it is below the boiling point of water.  Add
  an equal volume of water to the fat, and bring the mixture to a boil. Cover
  and let cool over night.
  
  STEP 3:  Take the fat out of the pot.  I find the easiest way to do this is
  to slice the fat in half with a knife and then cut wedges. You can push the
  first wedge down into the water and then lift its neighboring wedge out.
  Scrape all the non-fat gunk off the bottom of the fat (the side of the fat
  that was at the fat-water interface).
  
  STEP 4:  Measure out about six pounds of rendered fat (be accurate with
  this measurement). Cut the fat into small pieces (about the size of a
  tennis ball, but squarish, not round) and place in a bowl.
  
  STEP 5:  Set up your soap-making work area.  It should be outside, in a
  very well-ventilated area. It's supposed to help to do it on a warmer day
  rather than a cooler day, but I've never noticed the difference. Also,
  clear your stove top and open the window in the kitchen before you start
  making the soap.
  
  On a table, put your ceramic tub, the bowl of fat, the opened container of
  lye, a container with the water, and a container with the lemon juice.  If
  you will be adding scent, keep its container nearby. Also place your soap
  mold containers nearby. PUT ON ALL YOUR SAFETY GEAR.
  
  STEP 6:  Make the soap:  Pour the water into the ceramic tub.  Very
  carefully pour the lye into the tub. This is an exothermic reaction: it
  gives off heat, which is used to melt the fat. It also gives off odors
  which you don't want to breathe, so keep your head back. Stir the lye to
  dissolve it in the water. Then start adding the fat to the water/lye
  mixture, stirring with the long wooden spoon. Add the fat a bit at a time
  and stir until it's all melted. Then stir in the lemon juice, scent (if you
  are using it), and pour into molds. When the soap is firmer but not yet
  hard, cut into bars with a knife. It should be hard in an hour or so; you
  can test it with your finger.
  
  STEP 7:  Wrap in clean cotton rags and store in a cool, airy place for 3-6
  months.
  
  STEP 8:  When you clean up the pan that you made the soap it, be somewhat
  careful as there is probably still some unreacted lye in the pan.  The only
  time I've had a problem with this is when I've tried to scrape the dry soap
  that lines the pan off with my fingernail and then a few minutes later I
  notice that the skin under my fingernail is burning.  The easiest solution
  is just to wear gloves when you're cleaning the pan. It probably also helps
  to wash with extremely hot water so that the remaining soap (and fat if
  there is any) melts and dissolves in the water.

      Title: SOAP, part 2 of 2
 Categories: Usenet
      Yield: 6 pounds
 
           See Part 1                     
 
  : Continued from Part 1
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  In the U.S., Red Devil lye comes in 12-oz containers.  In Europe it
  generally comes in 350-g containers, which is about 3 percent more.  You
  don't want to measure lye, you want to use the whole container. If your
  container is not this size, then scale the recipe up or down accordingly.
  Leftover lye is a serious disposal problem.
  
  *  Where to buy 9 pounds of fat? If you're using an animal fat (beef or
  pork), you can buy it from your butcher. What I find I have to do is
  reserve it, because they normally don't keep the fat after they've cut up
  their cow. Sometimes they will charge you for the fat (I've paid anywhere
  from 10 to 45 cents a pound); sometimes they won't. I've only ever made
  soap with beef fat; this makes a hard, mild, slow-lathering soap. The
  recipe will work equally well with other animal fats to produce a similar
  result.  Coconut oil yields a softer, quick-lathering soap. Olive oil and
  other vegetable cooking oils yield a very soft soap that never completely
  hardens.  Unfortunately, these oils are sensitive to air and light, and
  soap made from cooking oils will spoil in a few weeks unless it is
  refrigerated.
  
  *  Volatile fragrance oils, also called essential oils, are highly
  concentrated scent ingredients.  You can usually buy them at health-food
  stores, and you can sometimes find exotic fragrances at specialty
  food-and-spice shops.  The amount that you should use depends on how
  fragrant you want the soap to be. A few drops of musk oil is enough to
  scent an entire batch of soap; less-potent fragrances such as a fruit oil
  might require about a teaspoon or two 5-10 ml. Soap scented with herbs is
  also popular; herbs like lemon thyme or verbena or lavender work well. To
  scent with herbs, make an herbal oil by packing a 1/2-cup (approximately)
  container with herbs and then filling it with a pleasant-smelling vegetable
  oil, such as almond oil. Let this mixture sit for a few weeks, stirring it
  every day, then heat in a double boiler for 10 minutes, then cool and
  strain the oil.
  
  *  The soap works just fine with no fragrance at all, and many people
  prefer it that way. I certainly do.
  
  *  You may run into problems at the stage "Add the fat and stir until it's
  all melted." I almost always do. What happens is that the water/lye mixture
  runs out of heat before all the fat melts. What you have to do is add heat
  somehow.  The way I do this is to grab the tub (which now contains all the
  fat), go into the kitchen, put it on top of a burner, and turn the burner
  (and the fan) on high. (Make sure the windows are all open too.) When all
  the fat is melted, I go back outside and continue, adding the lemon juice.
  
  *  The lemon juice lowers the pH.  The finished soap will have a pH of
  about 9; you can lower this by adding more lemon juice.
  
  : Difficulty:  challenging.
  : Time:  Day 1:  30 minutes preparation; 1-2 hours cooking.
  : Day 2:  usually about 1 hour.
  : Precision:  Be precise.  Also be careful.

      Title: RED BRAISED PORK SHOULDER
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 10 servings
 
           Pork shoulder (5 to 7 lb),          1    Cinnamon stick
           -with bone and rind                      -(about 2 inches long)
           Water                               4 sm Chili peppers,
    3/4 C  Sherry (dry)                             -dried (optional)
           -or Shaoxing wine                        Tangerine peel, dried,
    1/3 C  Dark soy sauce                           -3 pieces (optional)
           Chinese yellow rock sugar,          6    Garlic cloves (crushed)
           -6 crystals (each crystal           4 sl Ginger (thick)
           -about 1 inch square)               1    Scallion (whole), trimmed
  1 1/2 t  Salt (or to taste)                  2    Spinach bunches, washed
      6    Star anise cloves              
 
  Put the pork in a large pot with water to cover.  Bring to a boil, simmer
  for 2 minutes, then drain and rinse. Again add the pork to the pot with
  fresh water to cover, add the wine, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to
  medium, partially cover, and cook for 30 minutes. Add the rest of the
  ingredients (except the spinach), and simmer the pork for another 2 1/2 to
  3 hours. The rind and the fat should be very soft when it's done.
  
  Remove the pork from the liquid and keep it warm.  Strain the sauce into a
  large skillet and reduce it over high heat.  This may take a while,
  depending on how much liquid you end up with.
  
  Meanwhile, steam the spinach until just wilted, salt it lightly, and keep
  it warm. When the sauce is reduced (it should be the consistency of a thin
  syrup), put the pork shoulder in the center of a large platter, arrange the
  spinach around it, and pour the sauce over.

           -(extra strong)                 1 2/3 C  Powdered 10X sugar

----------------------------------FROSTING----------------------------------
      1 oz Cocoa powder, bitter                3 T  Water, boiling
      1 oz Butter (sweet), melted                   -(up to 4 T)
 
  In an electric mixer, whip the salted butter.  Add sugar, vanilla and eggs.
  Beat smooth.  Mix flour with cornstarch and baking powder and sift a second
  time (you sift it once before you measured it, right?).  Add flour mixture
  to egg mixture, stirring constantly.
  
  Make 8 layers, each less than about 1/4 inch thick, by baking each in the
  bottom of an 8-inch springform layer pan.  Do this by cutting a round of
  baker's parchment that exactly fits the bottom of the layer pan, then using
  a spatula to spread the dough evenly over the parchment. Make sure that it
  doesn't get too thin at the edges. Bake each layer for 7 minutes in a
  preheated 400 degree F. oven.  Stack the layers separated by waxed paper.
  
  MAKE THE PUDDING:  Use more chocolate in the pudding than you would
  normally use. If you want to be lazy and use pudding from a mix, then add
  about a tablespoon of top-quality cocoa to the pudding mix. Stir the
  pudding while it cools so that it does not congeal. Beat the unsalted
  butter until it is very smooth. When the butter and pudding are about the
  same temperature, add the pudding to the butter to get an even, smooth
  buttercream.
  
  Use the pudding/butter mixture as mortar, and layer the cake together,
  spreading the pudding/butter evenly between the layers.  Make sure the
  layers are even and parallel; if they are not, or if one is not straight,
  you can mend things with a little extra pudding here and there. Do not put
  pudding on top of the topmost layer, and try not to get too much on the
  outside edges.
  
  MAKE A CHOCOLATE FROSTING:  Sift the powdered 10X sugar and cocoa together,
  add the melted butter while stirring constantly, then add boiling water.
  Frost the cake, taking pains to make sure the sides are perfectly smooth
  and the top is perfectly smooth. Let the cake sit at cool room temperature
  for at least an hour before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Austrian 8-layer chocolate cake -- I made this recipe for my boyfriend
  on his birthday and he asked me to marry him (I did). I'm not saying for
  sure that the Prinzregent Torte is why Don wanted to marry me, but I've
  always worried that it might have been. It is a magnificent recipe that
  always evokes incredulous cries of pleasure from people that I serve it to.
  The cake is a lot of work, so I only make it about once a year, but the
  people that I make it for feel very special. Yield: Serves 2-8.
  
  *  If you are not an experienced baker, you should be warned that in
  recipes like this it is important to measure exactly and to follow the
  instructions exactly. People who prefer to cook by testing, tasting, and
  adding more ingredients should avoid intricate baking.
  
  *  These layers are baked in the bottom of a springform pan.  Such a pan
  bottom is about 8 inches in diameter, and has a raised lip that is about
  1/8 inch high. It resembles a miniature pizza pan. I have never succeeded
  in making this torte with layers bigger than about 10 inches; about 8
  inches is easier. The baker's parchment is crucial and there is no good
  substitute, though buttered kraft paper (from shopping bags) will work in a
  pinch. Use a new piece of parchment for each layer. If you don't make the
  layers straight, then when you pile them up, the cake will be mounded up in
  the middle or will sag down in the middle or will tilt to one side.
  
  *  If you are not an experienced cake froster, then make double the recipe
  of frosting. Unskilled frosters usually use too much frosting, and you
  don't really want to run out. You can charge money to people who want to
  lick the spoon if there is any left over.
  
  Difficulty:  rather difficult;  Time:  1 hour;  Precision:  measure
  carefully.

      Title: KOLACHKI
 Categories: Cookies, Russian, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 6 dozen
 
--------------------------------COOKIE DOUGH--------------------------------
    1/2 lb Cream cheese                        1 x  Walnut filling, below
           -(at room temperature)                   -OR
    1/2 lb Butter (at room                    12 oz Poppy seed filling
           -temperature)                            -(1 can)
      3 C  Flour                         

-------------------------------WALNUT FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lb Walnuts, finely ground              1 C  Sugar
      1    Egg                                      Water
 
  Mix butter and cream cheese until smooth.  Add flour and mix again until
  smooth.  Making this dough is easy with a food processor, hard with a
  mixer.
  
  Roll dough into 3 balls.  Refrigerate dough to keep it from drying out. The
  dough can be refrigerated for 1-2 hours, but it is not necessary.  Roll out
  1 ball at a time and flour lightly. Roll dough out in flour or granulated
  sugar so it doesn't stick.
  
  Cut dough into squares or circles using cookie or biscuit cutter.  Add
  about a teaspoon of filling. Roll squares into "logs." Fold circles over
  and seal with a fork. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 10-15 minutes or until
  lightly browned.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Mix all ingredients together.  Add water to obtain a sticky
  consistency.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Russian Cookies -- This recipe is from Mrs. Malinch, my little sister's
  high school Russian teacher.  I usually make this recipe at Christmas or
  Easter.
  
  My favorite fillings are poppy seed and walnut.  A recipe for the walnut
  filling is included.  The poppy seed filling can be found canned (Solo
  brand) in either the gourmet or cake section of most grocery stores. Yield:
  6 dozen Kolachki.
  
  *  The kolachki are delicate, so do not throw them in a plastic bag or pile
  high in a jar as you would cookies.  The kolachki can be frozen.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate, the assembly requires nimble fingers.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, up to 2 hours cooling, 15 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: TARRAGON GAME HENS
 Categories: Poultry, Herbs, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Cornish game hens                   2 T  Tarragon, dried
      6 T  Butter, at room                          -(or about 1 T
           -temperature                             -fresh tarragon)
      2 T  Lemon juice                       1/8 t  Salt
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Prepare the hens by rinsing thoroughly,
  checking for pin feathers and patting dry.  Be sure to remove yellow fat
  found at the cavity opening.
  
  Gently separate the skin from the flesh by sliding your fingers between and
  tearing the connecting membrane.  It is easiest to begin at the cavity
  opening and work up the breast. Leave skin attached at the lower two-thirds
  of the wings and base of the legs. Work carefully over the breastbone area
  so as not to tear the skin which is firmly attached at this point.
  
  Thoroughly blend the butter, lemon juice, tarragon and salt.  If the butter
  is not soft, it will be difficult to incorporate the lemon juice.
  
  Using your fingers, spread a layer of herb butter under the loosened skin
  of each hen. Spread a small amount on the skin. Tuck wings under the back
  of the hen and set each hen on its side, breast down on a roasting rack
  over a roasting pan.
  
  Roast for 15 minutes, then turn hens to other side.  Roast for another 15
  minutes, then set hens on their backs with breast up and roast for a final
  15 minutes (total cooking time about 45 minutes). Each time the hens are
  turned, baste by spooning pan juices over the bird. Hens are fully cooked
  when juices run clear and drumstick moves easily in its socket.
  
  Remove birds to a warm platter and let sit for 5 minutes.  Reduce pan
  juices to a thin glaze consistency over high heat and serve as a sauce.
  (You may want to flavor the pan juices with a little dry white wine.)
  Quarter birds before serving. Each bird should serve two people.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cornish game hens basted in tarragon butter -- This method of "basting"
  fowl by spreading an herb butter under the skin infuses the meat with the
  flavor of the herbs which usually is kept on the skin with normal external
  basting.
  
  *  This basting method can also be used when grilling, either over a
  barbecue or in the broiler. I prefer barbecuing to oven roasting in the
  summer (I tend to roast along with the birds) and prepare the birds a
  little differently in this case. Rather than grilling whole, before the
  butter is spread under the skin, each bird is split along the spine using a
  sharp heavy knife.  This is quite easy since the spine and ribs are easily
  cut with moderately heavy pressure and rocking motion on the knife blade. I
  then spread the bird, breast up, and crack the breast bone to flatten with
  a sharp blow on the breast with the heel of my hand. The wings are tucked
  under themselves and the legs and thighs left loose. The birds can be
  cooked ahead of time and taken on a picnic or prepped in advance and
  grilled at the picnic.
  
  *  Margarine may be substituted for the butter without major noticeable
  effects on the flavor.
  
  *  In the summer, I like to serve either a tabbouleh or Italian tomato
  salad (quartered RIPE tomatoes sprinkled with chopped fresh basil and
  drizzled with olive oil) and a white zinfadel.
  
  *  Since I like herb butters with all kinds of fish and fowl and have an
  herb garden, I generally make up 2 cups or more of herb butter at a time,
  using a food processor to assure thorough blending. The butter keeps well
  in the fridge for 2-3 weeks.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.

      Title: HOT AND SOUR SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Chinese, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 T  Peanut oil (or                      4 C  Chicken broth
           - other vegetable oil)                   - (canned or homemade;
      1    Garlic clove                             - I usually use canned)
      1 t  Ginger root                         1 T  Sherry, dry
           - (about 2 slices)                  3 T  Red wine vinegar
    1/2 C  Pork loin (boneless),               1 T  Cornstarch
           - shredded                        1/4 C  Water
  1 1/2 t  Soy sauce or tamari                 1    Tofu pad
    1/2 C  Bamboo shoots,                           - (a package generally
           - shredded                               - contains 2 pads)
      6    Shiitake mushrooms,               1/4 C  Green onions
           - dried                             2    Eggs
     10    Lily buds, dried                    1 T  Toasted sesame oil
           - (also called                      1 t  Chili oil (or less)
           - golden needles)                 1/4 t  White pepper
     12    Tree ear fungus, dried                   Salt and more pepper
           - (also called cloud ears)     
 
  Re-hydrate the dried ingredients (15 minutes:  in lukewarm water for the
  shiitakes, and in boiling water for the lily buds and tree ears).  Heat the
  chicken broth (if it's canned, prepare it).
  
  Mince the garlic and ginger root and combine them.  Shred the pork loin.
  Shred the bamboo shoots.  Combine the cornstarch and the water.  Chop the
  green onions.  Lightly beat the eggs.
  
  Heat oil in wok (medium), add the garlic and ginger, stirring 30 seconds.
  Add the pork, cooking until it loses its pink color.  Add the soy sauce,
  cook for 1 minute more. Add bamboo shoots, shiitakes, lily buds, tree ear
  fungi, stir quickly for 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth, sherry and
  vinegar. Stir cornstarch/water mix one last time and add it to the soup.
  Add the tofu and bring the soup to a boil.
  
  Turn the heat to low, add the green onions.  Add the beaten eggs in a slow
  stream, stirring several times.  Turn off the heat and add the sesame oil,
  chili oil, white pepper.  Season to taste and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Szechuan hot and sour soup -- I have seldom been to a Chinese restaurant
  without having hot and sour soup, and it was pleasant to discover how easy
  it is to make it at home. We have fixed this by itself as a dinner for two
  with enough left over for lunch. Particularly when we add extra meat and
  vegetables, we find it a very hearty soup which is surprisingly easy to
  make. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  Like many Chinese recipes, it takes longer to prepare the ingredients
  than it does to cook the soup. As I understand it, hot and sour soup,
  traditionally, is a Northern Chinese way of using leftovers.  Therefore,
  there are many, many variations possible, particularly in the dried
  ingredients.
   We never make it exactly the same way twice. I recommend using the
  shiitakes at least; most any grocery store has them. You may find tree ears
  and lily buds in an oriental food store.

  have one.  Spread cheese over the mixture, then pour remaining batter on
  top. Bake in 325 degree F. oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until done. Serve warm.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Corn Bread with peppers and cheese -- I got this recipe from net.cooks
  in the fall of 1983. It's really good! We always make a batch of Mexican
  cornbread when we cook chili; it's also a good dinner with just a salad and
  the beer of your choice.  The original recipe came from akgua!akguc!mah.

      Title: HAZELNUT CHERRY TART
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
    1/2 C  Plain flour                         2 T  Sugar
    1/8 t  Salt                                2 oz Butter
      2 oz Hazelnuts, roasted                  1    Egg yolk
           -ground                             2 t  Water

------------------------------CUSTARD FILLING------------------------------
      4    Egg yolks                       1 3/4 C  Cream
    1/4 C  Sugar                               3 t  Gelatine
      1 t  Vanilla extract                     2 T  Water

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      2 lb Cherries, canned                    2 t  Rum (see note)
      2 t  Gelatine                       
 
  MAKE PASTRY:  Sift flour and add all dry ingredients together, with the
  sugar in the centre, on a pastry board. Add the butter (softened), egg yolk
  and water. Work the liquids into the sugar, until it is creamy.
  
  Now work in the flour mixture, as you would for any sweet pastry.  Press
  the dough into a greased 9-inch flan tin. Prick the base of the pastry all
  over. Refrigerate for 30 mins, then cook in a moderate oven (375 degrees
  F.) for 15 to 20 mins (until golden brown)
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Put egg yolks, sugar and vanilla into a bowl and beat until
  thick and creamy.  Heat cream carefully until almost boiling.
  
  Combine the two mixtures, beating until smooth, then add the result to the
  top of a double boiler and simmer until it thickens (STIR CONSTANTLY).
  
  Dissolve the gelatine in the water and add to the cream mixture, stirring
  well until it is well mixed. Allow this mixture to cool completely before
  adding to the pastry case. Refrigerate until it sets.
  
  MAKE TOPPING:  Drain the cherries and reserve about 1 cup of the syrup.
  We don't use commercial canned cherries.  I would suggest a "light" syrup.
  Arrange the pitted cherries artistically over the top of the tart.
  
  Put the reserved syrup, gelatine and rum (we usually use cherry brandy or
  kirsch) into a saucepan and heat (stirring) until gelatine dissolves.  Cool
  the liquid and pour over the cherries.  Refrigerate until set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A thoroughly decadent desert -- This has simply got to be the best
  dessert you'll ever try. My wife has made this one many times. The only
  complaint ever lodged is that there was not enough.
  
  *  Don't be put off by the complexity of the recipe; it is well worth the
  effort.
  
  *  All the egg whites "wasted" can be used in something else, such as a
  Pavlova.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  several hours preparation, cooking and cooling.

  MAKE GRAVY:
  
  Make the tamarind paste:  add the tamarind to water and soak for  2 hours.
  During this time, squeeze the tamarind so that it becomes  pulpy.  Filter
  the liquid through a strainer to remove seeds, stem and skin of the fruit.
  
  Pound the onions, garlic and lengkuas.  Roast the peanuts, remove skins and
  grind finely.
  
  Fry the shrimp paste on medium heat for a few minutes.  Add the  onion and
  garlic paste to the frying pan.  Fry the onions until white.  Don't brown
  them.  Add the lemon grass, lengkuas, dried chilies, peanuts, sesame seeds,
  coconut milk, sugar, salt and tamarind paste.  Cook until the gravy is
  thick.

      Title: POPPYSEED CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 C  Chicken, cooked                     1 C  Ritz cracker pieces
           -(white or dark meat)                    -(about 1 "tube" of
     13 oz Sour cream                               -crackers)
     13 oz Cream of chicken soup               2 oz Butter
           -(1 can of condensed soup)          2 T  Poppy seeds
 
  Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and put it on the bottom of a
  casserole dish big enough to hold it.
  
  Combine sour cream and condensed chicken soup in a pan and pour it over the
  chicken in an even layer.
  
  In the same pan, (save dishes!) melt the butter and add broken-up crackers
  and poppy seeds. Mix together and distribute over the chicken and sauce.
  
  Bake at about 325 degrees F. for 20-30 minutes, until the topping is brown,
  the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is hot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken casserole with poppy seeds -- This is an easy and good way to
  use some cooked chicken. I got the recipe from my grandmother, who "hates
  to cook" but nevertheless seems to do a great job...
  
  *  Somehow this doesn't seem very nutritious.  Serve it with lots of
  vegetables.  Broccoli and carrots go well.  Use more or less of the
  ingredients to taste, or depending on how many you are serving.  Use
  different soups. Add mushrooms. Add other stuff. Have fun.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  40 minutes.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: SPLIT PEA SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Legumes, Usenet
      Yield: 16 cups
 
      1 lb Split peas                          3    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 lb Bacon, chopped                    1/2 C  Parsley (fresh, chopped)
           -into small squares                12 C  Beef broth (or any
      4 oz Butter                                   -other kind of broth,
      2    Celery stalks                            -or water)
  1 1/2 C  Yellow onion                        1    Bay leaf
           -(chopped)                         12    Peppercorns (cracked)
      1 C  Potato flakes (instant;             6    Green cardamom seeds
           -or, if you are a purist,                -(cracked)
           -about 2 cups of mashed                  Cognac (good), 1 jigger
           -potatoes)                        1/2 t  Chinese hot pepper oil
 
  Soak the peas for 6 hours and no more.  Use 1 teaspoon salt per quart of
  soaking water.  Drain; discard the soaking water.
  
  Cook the bacon until crisp; drain, dry, and discard fat.  The bacon should
  be crisp enough that the pieces will crumble as you stir the soup while it
  is cooking. I put it on my broiler pan and bake it for 30 minutes at 400
  degrees F.
  
  In a stockpot, put the cooked bacon, the butter, the celery and 1 cup of
  the onion. Saute over medium heat until the onion begins to brown. Add the
  beef broth, the soaked and drained beans, the mashed potato flakes (or
  mashed potato) and the parsley. Simmer for 2 1/2 hours, or until the peas
  are tender. Add the remaining 1/2 cup chopped onion and the minced garlic.
  
  In a tea ball, or tied in cheesecloth, put the bay leaves, the peppercorns
  and the cardamom seeds. Simmer for another 1/2 hour. Remove the tea ball or
  cheesecloth.  Add salt to taste, being careful not to add more than 2
  teaspoons.
  
  Pour in the cognac and the hot pepper oil, stir well, and serve
  immediately. Sprinkle some chopped fresh chives on top of each bowl after
  serving it. If you don't have fresh chives, then stir some dried snipped
  chives into the soup 5 minutes before serving it.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pea Soup With Bacon -- Peas and beans make superior cold-weather soups.
  They are rich and full of protein.  I developed this recipe as a response
  to the flavorful but bland "Senate Bean Soup." Split peas are very healthy,
  but when you go adding all of this bacon to them the healthfulness is
  diminished a bit in the interests of flavor.
  
  *  Some bacon is very salty.  You can remove most of the salt from it
  without materially affecting its flavor by boiling the cut, uncooked bacon
  pieces for 1 minute in a few quarts of water, then discarding the water and
  then drying the pieces with paper towels before cooking.
  
  *  Because the cooked peas have the ability to block your taste buds
  somewhat, make sure you rinse your mouth with a drink of water after each
  time you taste the soup while seasoning it, else you will over-season it.
  Incremental seasoning of legume soups is tricky, so if you are
  inexperienced, measure the seasonings carefully.
  
  *  I like to serve soups like this with unbuttered fresh bread.
  
  *  If you want to fool with the recipe, one of the places to fool with it
  is the spices that you put in the tea ball. Try some combination of Indian
  seasonings (coriander and cumin and ginger and cloves) or try taking out
  the peppercorns and cardamom seeds and putting in mustard seeds.
  
  *  Outside the tea ball, try adding sesame oil at the end instead of the
  cognac.  Try adding rutabagas, chopped into cubes, at the beginning of the
  cooking.  Try substituting olive oil for the butter and adding a half cup
  of grated Peccorino Romano at the end, right before serving. And, of
  course, try using ham hocks instead of bacon.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate (balancing the seasonings can be tricky).
  : Time:  6 hours soaking, 45 minutes preparation, 3 or more hours cooking.
  : Precision:  Measure the seasonings.

      Title: MUSHROOM SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Mushrooms                           2 T  Butter
  2 1/2 C  Milk                                2 T  Flour
      1    Stock cube                          2 T  Lemon juice
           -(beef or chicken)                       Salt, white pepper
 
  Wash mushrooms and cut into slices.  Melt butter over medium heat.  Fry the
  mushrooms for about 2 minutes or so.
  
  Stir in flour to form a thick-ish paste.  Gradually stir in the milk and
  stock while heating. Add the lemon juice and seasoning, bring to the boil.
  Simmer for about 10 minutes (or longer if you want).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Quick and easy mushroom soup -- This is based on a recipe my sister got
  from her high school cookery class.  It's easy to make whilst constructing
  a more involved main course. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  My sister insists on using a chicken stock cube, but I prefer beef.
  Chicken gives you a lighter colour, but I prefer the darker colour given by
  the beef.  (Of course, real stock is better, but takes time to prepare)
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Mushrooms, sliced                 1/3 lb Ham leg, sliced
      2 lg Onions, chopped                    12 oz Evaporated milk
      1 T  French mustard                      2 T  Whisky
      4 C  Beef stock                          1 t  Lemon juice
 
  Place the mushrooms, onions, mustard and stock in a saucepan and simmer
  gently for 20 minutes. Save a few mushroom slices for decoration later.
  
  Add the remaining ingredients, except for the lemon juice.  Heat through,
  but do not boil.
  
  Garnish with a few slices of mushroom (saved from before) and a squeeze of
  lemon juice.  Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Mushroom soup with whisky -- This is my family's favourite mushroom soup
  recipe.  The recipe originally came from a small booklet produced by
  Carnation.

      Title: SOPA AZTECA
 Categories: Soups, Southwest, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 C  Cream of tomato soup                2 C  Consomme
           -(use the recipe of               1/4 lb Corn tortilla chips,
           -your choice,                            -crumbled
           -or open a can)                   1/2 lb Monterey Jack cheese,
      4 oz Green chilies, diced                     -cut into half-inch
           -(or use more or                         -(or smaller) cubes
           -less, to taste)               
 
  Mix soups and bring to a boil.  Fill each soup bowl about 1/3 full with
  crumbled tortilla chips.  Place a layer of cheese cubes on top of the
  chips. Put one or two spoonfuls of diced, drained chilies on top of the
  cheese.
  
  When ready to serve, ladle boiling soup on top of the mixture in the soup
  bowls.  Do not stir.  Serve immediately.
  
  The boiling soup melts the cheese, but it also begins to make the chips
  soggy as soon as you pour it on. If you chop the cheese into finer cubes,
  it will melt more quickly, but if you chop it too fine, or if you grate it,
  then the cheese will form a layer on top of the soup instead of remaining
  as distinct chunks.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Aztec soup:  a simple cheese, tomato and beef soup -- I got this recipe
  from my mother, who got it from a friend in Tucson, Arizona.  The recipe is
  extremely simple and extremely quick.  I like to serve it with Mexican
  chef's salad. Serves 4-6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

----------------------------------ROUILLE----------------------------------
      6    Garlic cloves                     1/3 C  Bread crumbs
      1 t  Salt                                1    Egg yolk
     12 lg Basil leaves                        1 C  Olive oil
    1/3 C  Pimento, chopped                         Hot pepper sauce

------------------------------COURT BOUILLION------------------------------
      8 C  Water (more as needed,              1    Leek
           -up to 10 C)                             -(white section only,
      2 C  White wine, dry                          -cut into large pieces)
      1    Onion (coarsely chopped)            1    Celery stalk
      1 lg Carrot (cut into                    5 lb Fish trimmings (fish
           -large pieces)                           -frames, heads, tails)

-------------------------------BOUILLABAISSE-------------------------------
      2 sm Lobsters, live                      1 C  Carrot, grated
           -(each about 1 1/4 lb)              1 C  Onion, finely chopped
     36    Mussels                             1 C  Fennel, roughly chopped
     36 sm Clams, hard-shelled                 1 t  Sage
      2 lb Shrimp (medium-sized)               1    Orange peel strip
      3 lb Firm-fleshed fish                        -(about 1 x 3 inches)
           -(sea bass, red snapper,            1 pn Saffron
           -cod, etc.)                         1    Bay leaf
    1/2 C  Olive oil                           1 C  Parsley, roughly chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, minced               1 C  White wine, dry
      1    Leek  (white part only,                  Salt and pepper to taste
           -julienned)                    
 
  MAKE ROUILLE:  In a food processor fitted with the cutting blade, puree all
  ingredients (except the olive oil and hot pepper sauce) until finely
  minced. With the motor running, add the olive oil through the feed tube in
  as thin a continuous stream as possible. Stop occasionally to scrape down
  the sides. Add hot pepper sauce to taste. The rouille should be very spicy.
  
  MAKE COURT BOUILLION:  Bring water to boil and add all ingredients. Return
  to boil, then reduce heat to simmer. Skim scum from top while simmering.
  
  Simmer for 30 minutes.  Remove all solids and strain through double layer
  of cheesecloth.
  
  MAKE BOUILLABAISSE:  Cook lobsters in boiling water for 15 minutes, until
  bright red.  Remove all meat from tail and claws.  Cut into chunks and set
  aside.  Scrub mussels and clams well to remove sand.  De-beard mussels by
  pulling black fibers from shell.
  
  Steam mussels and clams over 1 inch of water for about 10 minutes, until
  shells open.  Discard any unopened mussels or clams.  Remove one shell from
  each mussel and clam, leaving meat in other shell.  Strain clam/mussel
  broth through double layer of cheese cloth and reserve 3 cups. Shell the
  shrimp.
  
  In a large skillet, heat olive oil.  Saute onion, leek, carrot, fennel,
  garlic, sage, saffron and orange peel until onions are soft and golden.
  
  In a large pot, bring to a boil about 8-10 cups of court bouillon, reserved
  clam/mussel broth and about 2 cups wine.  Add sauteed vegetables, bay leaf,
  parsley and wine and bring to simmer.  Add salt and pepper to taste
  
  Cut fish into large chunks.  Add fish and shrimp and simmer 8-10 minutes.
  Add lobster, mussels and clams and simmer 2 minutes. Serve in soup plates
  over garlic toast.

  : Continued from Part 1
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Marseille-style fish soup -- A friend and I had been talking about the
  glories of bouillabaisse for the past year and we finally decided to use
  New Year's Eve as an excuse to fish rather than continuing to cut bait, ad
  nauseam.  The following recipes are a combination of several derived from
  old issues of _Gourmet_, Julia Child, the "Playboy Gourmet Cookbook," and
  "gee, that sounds good, let's add it."
  
  *  The accompanying Rouille is a garlic-hot pepper mayonnaise condiment
  traditional to Marseille-style fish soup.  Rouille is traditionally made
  with a mortar and pestle but I prefer to use a food processor, it's just
  too much work otherwise. Pass the rouille as a condiment. Usually about 1 T
  per serving is sufficient, this stuff is the essence of garlic and hot
  pepper.
  
  *  If you can't get fish trimmings for the court bouillon, add bottled clam
  juice and shrimp and lobster shells.
  
  *  To be truly authentic, our bouillabaisse should have included eel, but
  my friend was a bit squeamish about that so we left it out. Basically, any
  combination of shellfish and firm-fleshed fish can be used with the more
  variety the better.  I dislike using crab since it flakes so easily and is
  lost in the broth.  If you can't get live lobsters, substitute frozen
  lobster tails but be careful not to overcook.
  
  *  Use saffron threads, rather than saffron powder which tends to be
  adulterated with safflower and not the same thing at all.  Be conservative
  with the saffron, a little goes a long way and can give the dish a
  medicinal taste.
  
  *  We preceded our dinner with herbed leek and prosciutto tartlets served
  with champagne. Dinner included bouillabaisse; a hearts-of-palm salad with
  pimento and greek olives and vinaigrette dressing; lots of crusty french
  bread to soak up the broth; a dry white wine (Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc
  '84); and my friend's mother's sponge cake with whipped cream icing, fresh
  raspberries and raspberry sauce, accompanied by Asti Spumante.

  1 1/2 C  Potatoes (raw),                 1 1/2 C  Brown sugar (light
           -grated, or ground                       -or dark, depends
  1 1/2 t  Baking soda                              -on what you like)
  1 1/2 C  Carrots (raw), ground           1 1/2 t  Lemon extract
           -(use medium blade)             1 1/2 t  Vanilla
  1 1/2 C  Bread crumbs                    1 1/2 C  Walnuts, finely chopped
           -(dry, not toasted)                      -(black walnuts are
  1 1/2 C  Crisco (vegetable                        -wonderful if you can
           -shortening)                             -get them)
      2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten               15 oz Raisins


-----------------------------SAUCE INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
    1/4 C  Water                               1 t  Lemon extract
    1/2 C  Brown sugar (I use a              1/8 t  Cornstarch, well-divided
           -mixture of light and dark)         1 T  Butter
      1 t  Vanilla                        
 
  MAKE PUDDING:  Mix the dry ingredients and set them aside.  Grease
  completely three large (25-oz) tin cans, such as the kind used for tomato
  puree.  Do NOT use the plastic-lined variety. Alternatively, grease one
  large steaming mold, with a hole in the center. Or improvise.
  
  Add the potatoes.  Mix well.  Then, in turn, add the baking soda, the
  carrots, the bread crumbs and the Crisco, making sure that you mix well
  after adding each ingredient. This matters, so do it! You may have to get
  some help from King Kong to blend adequately after adding the shortening.
  
  Add, in sequence, the brown sugar, the beaten egg, the lemon extract and
  the vanilla, mixing well after each addition. Now, add the dry ingredients
  mixture, a bit at a time.  The mixture will be extremely thick and very
  difficult to mix.  Add the walnuts and the raisins.  Mix them in.  Go
  ahead. You're strong enough.
  
  Push the mixture into the tins, with each about 3/4 full, or a little more.
  Seal the tins with aluminum foil and use a rubber band to hold the foil on
  (the pudding should not be exposed directly to the steam).  Steam 1 1/2 to
  2 hours, (until the pudding seems uniform. You can't overcook it, so err on
  the long side, please!) and cool if you're not going to serve it right now.
  
  Make the sauce by combining all of the sauce ingredients in a small
  saucepan and heating until it bubbles and all ingredients are dissolved. To
  serve, reheat by steaming for at least 45 minutes, or serve out of the
  original pot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An old Welsh steamed carrot pudding -- This is a good steamed pudding,
  despite the list of ingredients that are "good for you".  The sauce
  (following the recipe) is not a necessity for good taste, only for
  authenticity, although I LIKE it with the sauce. Some add rum to this
  sauce.  Suit yourself.  I like it both ways.
  
  This is a very old recipe, I gathered it from my grandmother, who would
  have been 101 (sniff) this year, who learned it from her Welsh mother, who
  learned it from her... (in Wales), ergo it's at least 200+. Given its
  similarity to some late Medieval puddings, one might suspect that its
  origins are much earlier. I determined the quantities listed here by
  measuring what my grandmother tossed into the pot. Yield: makes about 5
  pounds.
  
  *  This stuff keeps in the fridge nearly forever (at least a month) as long
  as you don't let it dry out.
  
  *  Decant or spoon out (depends on if you want to be fancy or not) and
  serve with sauce. Then, don't eat for two days to make up for the calories.
  
  Difficulty:  moderate (considerable physical work required); Time:  1 hour
  preparation, 3 hours steaming;  Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: SHU MEI
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
---------------------------------DUMPLINGS---------------------------------
      2 lb Turkey, ground                      6    Garlic cloves,
  1 1/2 t  Cornstarch (cornflour)                   -crushed, minced
  1 1/2 t  Sherry, dry                              -or pressed
      3 T  Light soy sauce                     1 T  Brown sugar
      1 T  Ginger, grated                      1 T  Sesame oil
           -or finely chopped                  1 pk Wonton wrappers
      6    Green onions, chopped                    Peanut oil

-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
  1 1/2 C  Fish sauce (You may                 6    Garlic cloves, finely
           -want to dilute this                     -minced or pressed
           -with water, depending              1 T  Ginger, finely
           -on its strength)                        -minced or grated
      1 C  Vinegar                             1 T  Red pepper, crushed
      1 C  Sugar                          
 
  Make the dipping sauce by mixing together all of its ingredients.  Store in
  the refrigerator until you are ready to use it.
  
  Stir together everything but the wrappers and the peanut oil.  Mix
  vigorously by hand until it begins to bind together. (About 1 minute or
  so.)
  
  Place about 1 1/2 - 2 T of filling in the middle of a wonton wrapper.  Fold
  the sides up around the meat so that you have a little bag or cup.  Press
  the bottom flat so that the bag doesn't fall over.
  
  Oil racks of the steamer with peanut oil.  Place dumplings in racks.  Steam
  for 15 to 20 minutes in covered rack over boiling water.  Serve hot with
  dipping sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Steamed dumplings (meatballs) -- This recipe is an adaptation of the one
  in "The Frugal Gourmet" by Jeff Smith. The bigger the batch, the better.
  There are never leftovers. Yield: makes 35-40.
  
  *  These little gems would probably go just fine with a favorite hoisin or
  chili dipping sauce.
  
  *  The steamer racks I recommend are the Chinese bamboo ones.  You can
  stack them quite nicely (I find that three racks work well) and they sit at
  just the right height above the boiling water in a wok. The real advantage
  is that water will not condense on your food if you use a bamboo steamer.
  
  *  The dipping sauce is an adaption of one served at the Phoenix Vietnamese
  restaurant in Saint Paul Minnesota; it was originally served with egg
  rolls, but works splendidly with these dumplings.
  
  *  The original recipe calls for ground pork, but I find ground turkey
  preferable.  The flavor is lighter and the calories far fewer.  Pork is
  fine, though, and even hamburger could be used in a pinch.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, but tedious.
  : Time:  45 minutes preparation, 15-20 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: RIGO JANCSI, Part 1 of 2
 Categories: Dessert, Hungarian, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      2 T  Butter                            1/2 C  Sugar
           Flour or cocoa                      4    Eggs, separated
      3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened              1 pn Salt
    3/4 C  Butter (unsalted),                1/2 C  Flour, all-purpose
           -softened                                -(sifted)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
     10 oz Chocolate (semisweet),          1 1/2 C  Heavy cream
           -chopped or broken                  4 T  Dark rum
           -into small chunks                  1 t  Vanilla extract

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
      7 oz Chocolate (semisweet),              1 C  Sugar, granulated (fine)
           -broken or chopped                1/3 C  Water
           -into small chunks         
 
  TO MAKE CAKE:   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  With a pastry brush or
  paper towel, coat an 11x17 inch jelly-roll pan with the butter.  This will
  seem like a lot; be very generous.  Sprinkle the flour or cocoa over the
  butter and shake the pan to coat the butter fully.  Tap the edge of the pan
  on a table to knock out the excess flour. Melt the chocolate in a double
  boiler or a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Set aside to cool to
  lukewarm.
  
  Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until the whites cling to the
  beater. Add about 1/4 cup of the sugar and beat until the whites form
  stiff, unwavering peaks. Cream the butter and the other (about) 1/4 cup of
  the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the melted chocolate
  and beat in the egg yolks one at a time.
  
  With a rubber spatula, stir about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into the
  chocolate mixture, then pour the chocolate mixture over the rest of the
  whites.  Sprinkle the flour lightly on top.  Gently fold the mixture
  together until no white streaks remain. Pour the batter into the prepared
  pan, spreading it evenly with a rubber spatula. Bake in the middle of the
  oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the cake shrinks slightly away from the
  sides of the pan and a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. It
  will still be very flat. Loosen the cake from the pan with a sharp knife
  around the sides and turn it out onto a rack to cool. (Put the rack over
  the pan and flip the whole thing over to keep the cake from breaking.)
  
  TO MAKE FILLING:  In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the cream and
  chocolate and stir over medium heat until the chocolate dissolves. Then
  reduce the heat to very low and simmer, stirring constantly, until the
  mixture thickens to the consistency of a pudding. Pour it into a bowl and
  refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
  
  When the mixture is very cold, pour in the rum and vanilla and beat with a
  whisk or beater until the filling is smooth and creamy and forms soft peaks
  when the beater is lifted.  Do not over-beat or you will get butter.  (If
  this should happen, don't despair; chocolate buttercream makes a perfectly
  fine filling.)
  
  Cut the cake in half to make two layers, each about 8 1/2 inches wide.
  Spread the filling over one layer and set the other layer on top. Smooth
  out the edges with a spatula. If one of the cake layers should break, use
  it on the bottom. Refrigerate on a rack for about 1 hour.

  : Continued from Part 1
  
  TO MAKE GLAZE:   In a small, heavy saucepan, heat the sugar, water and
  chocolate over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar and
  chocolate are dissolved. Make sure the sugar is fully dissolved or you will
  get a grainy glaze. Cover the pan and let the glaze cool for about 20
  minutes.
  
  Set a jelly-roll pan on a table with one short edge propped up.  Put the
  rack with the cake on something else so that it is suspended level over the
  pan but offset about 2 inches so that you can reach down into the lower pan
  with a spoon. Hold the pan with the glaze about 2 inches over the cake and
  pour the glaze on the cake. Using a large spoon, scoop up the glaze that
  collects in the jelly-roll pan and put it back on the cake. Keep doing this
  until the glaze begins to stop flowing smoothly. You should end up with a
  thick, even layer of glaze on the cake.
  
  Refrigerate the cake until the glaze is firm, 10 to 20 minutes.  Serve by
  cutting into 35 small, equal pieces, 5 in each row across and 7 in each row
  down.  For cutting, use a sharp knife that has been dipped in warm water
  and wiped off between slices. Keep refrigerated, but for maximum flavor,
  allow to come to room temperature before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Serving these chocolate cream slices will guarantee the success of any
  endeavor.  The name is pronounced, approximately, rrigo yanshi (trilled r).
  This recipe comes from "The Cooking of Vienna's Empire" and is, of course,
  Hungarian.  A friend of mine describes the Hungarians as the people who
  taught the Viennese how to bake. Yield: Makes 35.
  
  *  Fine granulated sugar is not the same thing as confectioner's sugar.
  Regular granulated sugar will work ok for the glaze, just make sure it is
  fully dissolved.  You can avoid lots of chopping by using chocolate chips;
  one cup of chips equals about 6 oz. chips.
  
  : Difficulty:  Quite difficult.  For experienced dessert cooks only.
  : Time:  several hours.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: HERBED CORNBREAD DRESSING, Part 1 of 2
 Categories: Entrees, Southwest, Holiday, Herbs, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
---------------------------------CORNBREAD---------------------------------
  1 1/2 C  Cornmeal, yellow                    1    Egg (lightly beaten)
    1/2 C  Flour, all-purpose                  3 T  Vegetable oil
      1 t  Salt                                1 C  Milk
      2 T  Baking powder                            Vegetable oil

--------------------------------TURKEY BROTH--------------------------------
      1    Turkey neck                              -celery stalks
           -(skin removed)                     1    Celery stalk
           Giblets and gizzard                 1 sm Onion, quartered
           -from 1 turkey                     12 C  Water
           Leaves from 4                 

----------------------------------DRESSING----------------------------------
     12 oz Bread cubes (herbed)              1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
      1 lg Yellow onion,                       2 C  Pecans, roughly chopped
           -chopped fine                            Butter (or margarine)
      3    Celery stalks,                           Salt
           -chopped fine                            Black pepper
      3 C  Rice, cooked (cooled                     Rubbed sage
           -uncovered overnight                     Thyme
           -in a shallow dish)            
 
  MAKE CORNBREAD:  The night before, make the cornbread.  Preheat oven to 425
  degrees F.
  
  Thinly coat the bottom of a standard Pyrex pie plate, or 9-inch square
  baking pan, with vegetable oil. Put pan in oven while it is preheating and
  you are mixing the cornbread batter.
  
  In a mixing bowl, blend together the cornmeal, flour, salt and baking
  powder. Stir in the egg and about 3 T vegetable oil. Add milk and mix
  thoroughly by hand. The consistency should be a thick, but not "doughy,"
  liquid.  It may be necessary to add a little more milk. Pour into preheated
  pan and bake for 30 minutes or until slightly brown on top.
  
  Let cool in pan for 30 minutes.  Remove from pan and break up into very
  large chunks in a large mixing bowl. Let stand overnight, uncovered. This
  will ensure that it is dry and stale.
  
  MAKE TURKEY BROTH:  The night before, make the turkey broth.  Bring about
  12 C of water to a boil in a large pot. Thoroughly rinse turkey neck,
  giblets and gizzard. Add turkey parts, onion, celery leaves and celery
  stalk to water, cover and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer on very low
  heat for 2 hours. Strain the broth, cover, cool quickly and refrigerate.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
           See Part 1                     
 
  : Continued from Part 1
  
  MAKE DRESSING:  30 minutes before you are ready to stuff the turkey, make
  the dressing.
  
  Crumble the stale cornbread in the very largest bowl you can find.  Add the
  herbed bread cubes and mix thoroughly by hand.  Add the rice and mix
  thoroughly by hand.
  
  Briefly saute the onions and celery in butter just enough to make the
  vegetables translucent.  Saute the mushrooms in butter (or margarine) until
  all the resulting liquid has evaporated.  Add the sauteed onions, celery
  and mushrooms, and mix thoroughly. Add the pecans and mix thoroughly.
  Season with salt, pepper, sage and thyme to taste.
  
  Bring the turkey broth to the boil and boil for a minute or two to make
  sure it is sterile. If you are going to stuff the turkey, add just enough
  turkey broth to barely moisten the dressing. Taste for seasoning and adjust
  if necessary.
  
  Very loosely stuff the abdominal cavity and breast cavity with dressing. Do
  not pack it in tightly.  It needs room to expand.  You are going to be
  cooking some more dressing in a baking pan beside the turkey, so there will
  be plenty to go around.
  
  Secure neck cavity opening with one or more poultry skewers.  The abdominal
  cavity may be left open or (if your butcher cleaned the turkey properly and
  left a flap of skin) secured with poultry skewers.
  
  Add enough boiling broth to the remaining dressing to moisten it uniformly.
  Do not over-moisten.  The baked dressing should be barely moist, not
  gummy-wet.  14 Spoon dressing into uncoated baking pans.  Cover with
  foil/plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to bake.
  
  One half hour before serving dinner, bake dressing, uncovered, at 425
  degrees F. for 30 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Southwestern style herbed cornbread turkey stuffing -- This is the
  traditional McGarvey family dressing for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.
  It originated with my maternal grandmother in southern Virginia and evolved
  through her moves to Texas, Oklahoma and California and further evolved
  through my military family's moves all over the world.  The recipe includes
  making 1 batch of cornbread and 1 batch of turkey broth.  Directions are
  given for both stuffing the bird and baking the dressing separately.
  
  *  This recipe makes enough dressing to stuff a 15-pound turkey and 2
  9-inch-square baking pans.
  
  *  Never stuff the turkey until you are ready to roast it.  Cooking lore is
  rife with horror stories of food poisoning resulting from turkeys stuffed
  too early and let sit while wonderful organisms develop in the stuffing.
  Make sure you bring the turkey broth to a boil before you use it, just to
  make sure that nothing is growing in it. The stuffing inside a turkey does
  not reach a high enough temperature to kill bacteria while the turkey is
  roasting, so you must be extremely careful with what you put there.
  
  *  I like to use Pepperidge Farm brand herbed bread cubes.
  
  *  I use a huge ceramic bowl (large enough for "rising" a 4-loaf recipe of
  bread dough) in which  to mix the dressing.  If you don't have one handy,
  you can use your kitchen sink. Clean and rinse the sink thoroughly, then
  put in the stopper and use as a mixing bowl. If you are going to stuff the
  turkey, be sure that you don't overmoisten the dressing. The stuffing will
  absorb a lot of moisture from the bird, and who wants a turkey with
  stuffing soup? Also, be sure to not over-stuff the turkey: the stuffing
  will expand during the roasting and it needs room to expand.
  
  *  About 12 C of turkey broth is at least double the amount of liquid
  necessary to moisten the dressing.  If you use all of it, you will not have
  a relatively light, dry dressing. The extra broth should be used in making
  turkey gravy or can be the base stock for making turkey soup with the
  carcass. If you're not up to making turkey broth, you can substitute
  chicken broth, but this is a great way to use the neck and gizzard.
  
  *  No quantities of the herbs are given because you can make this as spicy
  or as mild as you like. We like ours heavy on the sage and thyme.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  several hours, spread over 2 days.
  : Precision:  measure the cornbread ingredients.

 Categories: Appetizers, Chinese, Usenet
      Yield: 2 dozen
 
-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      2 C  Flour, all-purpose                1/2 C  Water

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
    1/2 lb Pork, ground                        2    Water chestnuts,
    1/2 sm Chinese (Napa)                           -chopped
           -cabbage, cored                     1 t  Salt
           -and chopped                      1/2 t  Sugar
      1    Green onion,                        1 pn White pepper
           -coarsely chopped                   1 t  Sesame oil
      2    Ginger (fresh),                          TO COOK
           -thumb-sized slices,                5 T  Vegetable oil
           -minced                             1 C  Water

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
           Hot chili oil                            Soy sauce
           Red rice vinegar               
 
  In a bowl, combine flour and water, mixing to form a ball.  Remove to a
  floured board and knead with your palm for about 3 minutes.  Shape into a
  ball, cover with a damp towel, and let stand for about 10 minutes.
  
  Make the filling by combining the filling ingredients above.  Refrigerate
  until ready to use.
  
  To shape and assemble, knead dough for about 3 minutes.  Roll into a
  cylinder that is about 1 inch in diameter. Cut off the ends, then cut into
  about 24 pieces, each about 3/4-inch wide. With the cut side up, press the
  dough down with your palm to flatten. Use a rolling pin to make pancakes
  about 2 1/2 - 3 inches in diameter. (They get quite thin; that's what you
  want.)
  
  Spoon about 1 tablespoon of filling into the center of each pancake.  Fold
  the dough over to make a half circle and pleat the edges firmly together.
  
  To pan-fry, heat cast-iron or other heavy-bottom skillet over moderate
  heat. Add about 3 T oil, swirling to coat bottom. (Watch out, it sizzles
  quite a bit. Don't get burned!) When oil is hot, place potstickers, seam
  side up, in skillet and agitate (shake) for 30 seconds. Pour in water,
  cover and gently boil over moderate heat for 7 to 8 minutes. When oil and
  water start to sizzle, add remaining 2 T oil. Tip skillet to distribute oil
  evenly; watch carefully (uncovered) to prevent sticking. When bottoms are
  brown (usually several minutes later), remove from heat and carefully lift
  out potstickers with spatula.
  
  To serve, turn potstickers over (dark side up) and arrange on serving
  platter. Combine chili oil, vinegar and soy sauce in proportions to suit
  your taste and offer sauce for dipping. Alternatively, cut up a hot chili
  pepper into red rice vinegar.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Delicious Northern Chinese snack and hacker's staple -- Hackers on both
  coasts and most places in between love potstickers (though if you're from
  the Right Coast, you probably know them as Peking Ravioli, or just ravs.
  This recipe is based on one found in Chef Chu's Distinctive Cuisine of
  China. Total preparation time is about 45 minutes. They don't come out as
  good as the ones from Cho's in Mountain View, but if you don't happen to be
  within 45 minutes of Mountain View, they'll do very nicely, thank you.
  Yield:  Makes about 2 dozen.
  
  *  You can freeze uncooked potstickers for later use, if you squeeze out
  the water from the cabbage during preparation (in a colander or
  cheesecloth). Freeze potstickers separately on cookie sheets until firm,
  then put them in plastic bags. When rolling out the pancakes, leave the
  centers slightly thicker than the edges. A thicker center will hold up
  better during the browning.
  
  *  If you prefer, steam potstickers for about 12 minutes over boiling water
  instead of pan-frying.  (No self-respecting hacker would be caught eating
  steamed potstickers, though.)
  
  *  These are really not hard to make, and come out quite nicely!  Following
  the dough recipe above leads to a fairly dry and floury dough; this makes
  it hard to roll out and pleat. Feel free to add a little more water. There
  are also now commercially available potsticker presses that take care of
  folding and pleating; they're cheap and plastic and work rather well.
  
  *  The perfect potsticker is uniformly brown with a thick brown area on the
  bottom (where it sticks to the pot); it seems that achieving this only
  comes with practice. I tend to fry both sides a bit before adding the
  water; this helps. Beware of too much heat; the bottom will bubble and
  crack.  This doesn't taste any different, but doesn't look as nice.
  
  *  If you don't cook the whole batch at once, store the potstickers so that
  they don't touch; the dough tends to stick to itself, so the potstickers
  may tear as you remove them.
  
  *  Many restaurants serve Hoy Sin sauce (hoisin) instead of hot sauce.
