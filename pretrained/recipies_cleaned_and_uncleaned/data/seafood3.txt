Simple Salmon Fillets

seafood

3/4 lb salmon; fillets are best
1  lemon
1 teaspoon dill; dried or better, fresh
1  salt
1  pepper; white
2 tablespoon mayonaise

Hopefully you selected 2 nice fillets. Preheat the oven to 400F.
Place the fillets skin side down in a baking dish (I use glass).
Squeeze the lemon over and lightly sprinkle with salt and some white
pepper.
Then spread the dill over the fillets and let set for fifteen
minutes--if you have the time!  Spread the Mayo evenly over the
entire surface and cut end(s) of the fillets (just like spreading
peanut butter).
Place on a high shelf in the oven (just under the broiler element).
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes for each inch of thickness. Then kick the
broiler in for a few minutes, just until you see some browning of the
mayo. * This technique will give you delicious, moist salmon every
time--just don't overdo the cooking!  The broiler bit isn't
mandatory, it just gives a nice finish.  If you skip the broiler then
just add a few minutes to the baking time.

In a large wok or pan, heat 3 tablespoons of oil and stir- fry onion,
ginger and 2/3 of the chopped chillies for a couple of minutes. Add
crab pieces and strained tamarind water, lower heat and simmer for
3-4 minutes. Lift the crab out onto a serving dish and to the mixture
in the wok add 3 teaspoons sugar and 2 of tomato paste. Stir, add
dissolved cornflour and stir again until the mixture thickens. Pour

Sm„ltsill (Melted Herring)

seafood, swedish

1 quart water
1 teaspoon salt
4 medium boiling potatoes; peeled
2  fillets of canned matjes herring
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon parsley; finely chopped
3  radishes; finely chopped or thinly
2  hard-cooked eggs; whites and yolks chopped

Bring the water and salt to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan, add the
potatoes and cook uncovered. Select a heatproof plate the same
diameter as the pot to serve as a lid. Lay the herring fillets on the
plate side by side and make neat, diagonal slices through them every
1/2" without disturbing their original shape. When the potatoes are
about half-cooked (after 10 minutes or so, but test now and then with
the tip of a small, sharp knife), cover the pot with the plate of
sliced herring and continue cooking the potatoes over medium heat for
another 10 to 12 minutes or until potatoes are tender and the herring
is heated through or "melted." Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of
butter in a small saucepan. Cook slowly over moderately low heat to
brown the butter lightly. Drain potatoes, return to pan and dry over
low heat for a minute or two, shaking constantly. Place the herring
on a serving plate and garnish with chopped parsley, radishs and egg
whites and yolks. Pour the hot butter on the herring only and serve
the potatoes in a separate bowl.

Smoked Mackerel With Nuts~ Grapes & Brown Ric

rice, seafood

2 small smoked mackerel or- smoked trout
2 1/2 oz chopped, toasted hazelnuts or- waln; uts
1 lb seedless grapes
1/2 lb brown rice
1  fresh mint or watercress
2  lemons
1  a little sunflower oil
1/2 pint creamy yoghurt (or more)

Cook the rice in double its volume of fast boiling salted water.
Refresh it and dress it with 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon
oil and plenty of salt and pepper.  Stir in the nuts and 5-6
tablespoons chopped mint or watercress.  (Watercress is good but mint
is even better for this dish.) Press the mixture firmly into a
lightly oiled ring mould, cover and chill for a couple of hours or
more.

Close to serving time, halve the grapes and toss them in the juice of
half a lemon plus scant 1 tablespoon oil. Add some mint or watercress
sprigs. Skin, bone and flake the fish and mix it in gently. Unmould
the ring of rice, put some of the fish and grape mixture into the
centre and garnish with sprigs of mint or watercress. Serve the rest
of the fish mixture in a separate bowl, and hand round the
well-chilled yoghurt in a second bowl.

Smoked Salmon

fish, meats

1  salmon; or fresh salmon ste
1  butter; melted
1  lemon juice; fresh
1  seasoned salt
1  dill
1  cucumber mayonnaise; (see r
1  yogurt dill sauce; (see rec

Servings:  1

SALMON STEAKS: Combine equal parts of butter and lemon and brush each
steak on both sides with the mixture. Sprinkle with seasoned salt and
dill. Serve with Cucumber Mayonnaise. Charcoal Smoker: Use 5 lbs.
charcoal, 3 quarts hot water, 1 to 2 wood chunks and smoke 1 hour.
Electric Smoker: Use 2 quarts hot water, 1 to 2 wood chunks and smoke
1 hour. WHOLE SALMON: Brush salmon cavity with dill and seasoned
salt. Repeat on the outside of the salmon.  Chill leftover salmon and
serve with sour cream and dill or Yogurt Dill Sauce. Charcoal Smoker:
Use 7 to 9 lbs. charcoal, 4 quarts hot water, 2 wood chunks and smoke
3 to 5 hours, depending on size. Electric Smoker: Use 4 quarts hot
water, 2 wood chunks and smoke 3 to 5 hours, depending on size.
Yield: 1/3 lb. per person Note: This very expensive delicacy can be
made easily and economically at home. Serve hot or cold with Cucumber
Mayonnaise or Yogurt Dill Sauce. Another note: Frozen seafood should
always be thawed before cooking. The most harm you can do to seafood
is to overcook.  Seafood is done when the flesh turns white or
opazue. The meat will flake easily when forked and shellfish will
feel firm to the touch. If cooked in the shell, the shells will open
when done. Seafood is most delicate and requires short cooking times.
Fish with high fat content will require longer cooking. Recipe from
"Cook'n Cajun Water Smoker Cookbook".

Smoked Trout

seafood

1  trout
1  lime, sliced
1  lemon, sliced
1  smoking wood

* Smoking woods can be as varied as Mesquite, Apple, Alder, Hickory,
or
any other flavor you like. Soak the wood in water at least
overnight. * You will need a covered grill, (Weber is the best.) * If
you use a grill rather than a smoker prepare the charcoal in two
piles on either side of the cooking area. * Light with a
non-petroleum lighter, (electric, parafine based
firestarters, or if you were a Scout, you can try the old two match
method.) After all that the cooking is rather simple. In the cavity
of each trout alternate slices of lemon and lime. Either oil the fish
or the grill with as much oil it will handle. It will make taking the
fish off eaiser. Place the fish in the middle of the charcoal fires.
Put the soaked wood on the charcoal, close the lid (and do not open
for at least 1 hr.), and wait. It will take at least 1 hr to cook and
possible more depending on the number and size of the fish. Check it
after the hour to see if it is flaky. If it is not done, serve some
more appetizers and wait another hour. A good rule of thumb is: 1lb
trout=1 hour, 2 or 2 lb trout=1 1/2 hour, 3 or 3 lb trout=2 hrs.,
etc. Use any leftover in a salad with a spicy dressing. You will be
amazed! Submitted By KEN HAYCOOK <KHAYCOOK@UNICOMP.NET> On THU, 22

Smoked Trout Tartlets

appetizers, seafood

      ----PHYLLO TART SHELLS----
1 large egg white
2 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
8  phyllo dough sheets (14x18
      ----SMOKED TROUT FILLING----
2 pkg cream cheese, low-fat (8 oz)
1/2 lb trout fillets; smoked, skin -and pin bon
1/3 cup scallions; chopped (2 scall
4 teaspoon horseradish; well drained
1 cup cucumber; shredded

To make phyllo tartlet shells: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Lightly coat 2 mini-muffin pans with nonstick cooking spray. In a
small bowl, whisk together egg white, oil and salt.
Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface and with a pastry brush,
lightly coat it with the egg-white mixture. Lay a second sheet
smoothly on top, taking care to line up the edges before setting the
sheet down. (Once you set down the sheet, it cannot be moved.) Brush
with the egg-white mixture and repeat with 1 more sheet. Lay a fourth
sheet on top but do not brush it.
With a knife, cut the dough into 4 strips lenghtwise and 5 strips
crosswise, making 24 squares. Press squares into muffin cups and bake
for 8 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Transfer the
tartlets to a rack and let cool. Repeat the procedure with the
remaining 4 sheets of phyllo and egg-white mixture. (The baked
tartlet shells may be stored in a closed container at room
temperature for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months.)

To make smoked trout filling: In a food processor, combine cream
cheese and smoked trout; process until fairly smooth. Add scallions
and horseradish and pulse until just combined. (Alternatively, finely
mince the smoked trout with a knife and combine with the cream
cheese, scallion and horseradish in a small bowl.) (The smoked
filling may be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 2 days.) Shortly
before serving, spoon or pipe about 1 heaping tsp. of filling into
each tartlet shell and garnish with shredded cucumber.

1/3 cup light cream cheese, soften
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 dash hot pepper sauce
1  dill pickle, cut in chunks
4  7-inch tortillas
4  boston/leaf lettuce leaves

Tips:

To make tuna spread by hand, mince the pickle before blending
ingredients together in bowl with spatula.

To freeze Tuna Roll-ups, omit lettuce leaf; wrap roll-ups tightly in
foil and freeze for up to 1 week.

Instead of tortillas, try whole wheat roti, which is an Indian
flatbread, if available.

To soften up the tortillas and make them easier to roll, warm them in
a toaster oven or microwave.

4 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon flour
1/2 cup sherry

Cut off the turtle's head and stand it upside-down to drain. After it
has bled well, scrub with a stiff brush. Drop into a kettle of
boiling water to cover, and cook until the skin and upper shell peel
away easily. Discard this water and cover turtle with fresh water.
Add the vegetables and herbs, and salt and pepper. Simmer gently for
two hours then strain, reserving the broth.  Remove shells and skin
and pick out the meat, being careful not to break the gall sac
(located in the liver). Cut the meat into small pieces and brown in
butter.  Blend in the flour, then the strained stock and simmer it
until tender. To serve, pour into a tureen with the sherry and
garnish with sliced eggs. If you prefer, float a few slices of egg on
each plate of soup.

1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/4 cup water
2 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1  salt
1/4 cup cilantro leaves; choppd fine
      ----FRIED SPINACH LEAVES----

1  large platter
1  small bowl
1  sifter
1  whisk
1  deep, heavy saucepan
1  deep fat thermometer
1  slotted spoon
1  wok or deep, heavy saucepan

Soft-shell crabs are in season from late spring through August. You
should buy them alive and use the same day. (WP)

1. Prepare the crab: Remove the lungs and tail and arrange the crab
on a large platter.  Sprinkle with the minced jalapeno and the
chopped cilantro. Pour the lime juice over and let marinate for at
least 30 minutes, refrigerated.  When ready to cook, season lighlty
with salt.

2. Prepare the batter: In a small bowl, sift together the flour and
baking powder.  Whisk in the water until the batter is smooth, then
add the remaining ingredients, seasoning with cayenne and salt to
taste. If made earlier in the day, set the bowl into an ice bath.

3. At serving time, in a deep, heavy saucepan, wok, or deep-fat
fryer, heat 3 inches of oil to 350 degrees.

4. Dip each crab into the batter and coat well. Carefully place one
or two in the hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
Remove with a slotted spoon or a flat strainer and drain on paper or
clean toweling. Keep warm while preparing the remaining crab and the
spinach.

5. Use the same oil to fry the spinach. Clean the spinach leaves
well, trim and dry thoroughly.  Fry until crisp and translucent,
about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on clean
toweling. Season with salt to taste and serve immediately.

Presentation: Arrange a few fried spinach leaves on half of each of 4
plates.  Place 1 crab on the other half and serve immediately.

To prepare ahead: Through step 2, the fish can be marinating, the
batter ready. Have the spinach cleaned and ready. Heat the oil at
serving time and continue with the recipe.

Note: Shrimp can be substituted for the crab.  If using shrimp, peel,
leaving the tail intact.

Soft-Shell Crabs With Creamy Tomato Sauce

fish

      ----YIELD: 4 SERVINGS----
6 tablespoon olive oil
6  garlic clove; thinly sliced
6 large shallots; thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/4 teaspoon celery seeds
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon sugar
35 oz tomatoes, whole; packed in juice, drained
1 cup creme fraiche
1 cup flour
8  soft-shell crabs; cleaned

In a large nonreactive skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil
over moderate heat for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and shallots and
cook, stirring frequently, until the shallots are translucent and the
garlic begins to brown, 5 to 6 minutes (don't let the garlic get too
brown or it will be bitter).  Stir in the cumin and celery seeds, red
pepper and 1/2 teaspoon each of the salt and black pepper. Cook for 1
minute longer. Stir in the sugar and tomatoes and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer the sauce for 15
minutes. Add the creme fraiche and simmer for 6 minutes longer. Cover
and keep warm. (The sauce can be made up to 1 day ahead. Cover and
refrigerate. Reheat before serving.) Preheat the oven to 250F.  On a
plate, toss the flour with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon each of salt
and black pepper. Pat the crabs dry with paper towels and dredge them
in the seasoned flour. In a large skillet, preferably nonstick, heat
2 tablespoons of the olive oil over moderately high heat. Add 4 of
the crabs and cook, turning once, until red and crisp, about 3
minutes per side. Transfer the crabs to a heatproof platter and place
in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons
olive oil and 4 crabs.  To serve, spoon the tomato sauce onto 4
warmed plates and arrange 2 crabs on the sauce on each plate. Recipe

Soft-Shell Crabs With Lemon & Capers

fish

      ----YIELD: 4 SERVINGS----
2  lemons
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup olive oil extra-virgin
8  soft-shell crabs; cleaned
3 tablespoon butter, unsalted
5 medium shallots; chopped
1/2 cup wine, white, dry
2 tablespoon capers; drained

Using a small sharp knife, peel 1 of the lemons, removing all of the
bitter white pith.  Working over a bowl, cut in between the membranes
to release the sections. Squeeze the juice from the remaining lemon
into the bowl of sections and set aside. Preheat the oven to 250F. On
a large plate, combine the flour with the pepper. In a large
nonreactive nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil
over moderately high heat. Pat the crabs dry with paper towels and
dredge them in the flour. Add 4 of the crabs to the skillet and cook,
turning once, until red and crisp, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer
them to a heatproof platter and place in the oven to keep warm.
Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and 4 crabs. Add
the butter and shallots to the skillet and cook over moderately high
heat, stirring frequently, until the shallots have softened, 3 to 4
minutes. Increase the heat to high, add the wine and simmer until
reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  Add the reserved lemon sections
and juice and the capers and stir well. Place 2 crabs on each plate
and spoon the sauce on top. Food & Wine, June, 1991

Sole Steamed On A Bed Of Ceylon Tea

fish

1 1/2 lb sole, flounder or fluke*
1 1/2 tablespoon ceylon tea, loose
1  salt
1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 small limes; peel/seed/dice
1  ceylon tea butter sauce

* Use 2 Dover sole, skinned and filleted to give 8 fillets; OR 4
flounder fillets (6 to 7 ounces each), cut in half lengthwise along
the center line of the fillet

"Maniere imbued sole with the exotic woody scent of Ceylon tea by
steaming the fish on a bed of the leaves. (Loose tea leaves will give
more flavor than tea bags.) A rich, warmly colored butter sauce, made
with a Ceylon tea-infused vinegar, completes the movement, and a
garnish of a sparkling dice of lime cuts the righness of the sauce."

Make the butter sauce; set aside in a warm place, and cover to keep
warm.

Cut a double layer of cheesecloth hat is twice as long as the steamer
rack. Lay the cheesecloth on the steamer rack so that half of the
cheesecloth covers the rack and the other half falls outside the
steam. Sprinkle the tea over the cheesecloth in the steamer and fold
the outer half of the cheesecloth over the tea to enclose it.

Fold each fillet in half, skinned side in. Sprinkle with salt and
place in a single layer on the cheesecloth on the steamer rack. Place
over simmering water, cover, and steam until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.

Just before the fish is cooked, melt the butter in a frying pan over
high heat. Add the lime and saute just to warm through, about 30
seconds. Remove from the heat.

To serve, divide the fillets among four plates. Sprinkle the lime
over the fish and spoon the sauce over.

Serve the fish with boiled potatoes or a simple rice pilaf; other
vegetables muddy the delicate flavors of fish and sauce. If you have
deep plates, spoon all of the sauce onto the plates so that the fish
luxuriates in it. If not, spoon some sauce over each fillet and serve
the rest in a sauceboat.

remaining butter evenly over tops of fish.

Bake fish, uncovered, until it flakes readily when prodded in

South Texas Oysters

appetizers, seafood

4  dozen small oysters, drained
1  12 oz bottle of chili sauce
2 tablespoon bell peppers, chopped
2 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
12  slices bacon, cooked and
1  crumbled
3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

Simmer oysters in a skillet until their edges begin to curl. The
oysters make enough of their own liquid to do this. Drain the oysters
and transfer to glass baking dish. Add chili sauce, bell pepper,
Worcestershire sauce, bacon and cheese. Place in oven 10 minutes
(didn't say what temp. - probably just long enough to melt the
cheese). Serve with toothpicks and toast points (I'm assuming you
DON'T eat the toothpicks ;)

Spaghetti With Clam Sauce

pasta, seafood

24 oz clams (canned), with juice (2 stand; ard cans)
8 oz tomato paste (1 standard can)
1 lb tomatoes (canned), with liquid
4 tablespoon butter, clarified
8  garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon parsley
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1 lb spaghetti
1 tablespoon cooking oil

Saute the garlic in about 2 T of clarified butter until lightly

to serving.

Cook and drain the spaghetti.  In the empty cooking pot, melt the
remaining clarified butter, and return the spaghetti to the pot and
stir until coated uniformly.  Serve with lots of garlic bread and a
dry white wine.

NOTES:

*  Garlic, clam and tomato spaghetti -- This recipe originally
appeared in "Lowbush Moose (and other Alaskan recipes)" by Gordon R.
Nelson. I've modified it somewhat. Yield: Serves 4-6.

*  You can use oil instead of clarified butter, at some sacrifice in
flavor.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Spaghetti With Salmon & Sorrel (Or Spinach)

pasta, seafood

4 oz cooked and flaked salmon
1 oz fresh sorrel (or spinach) *
2 oz broccoli florets
8 oz fresh spaghetti
1  lemon juice and butter
2 tablespoon freshly grated parmesan

*Note: Amount given for sorrel (or spinach) is for trimmed weight.

Take some sorrel or spinach leaves and roll them up tightly, a few at
a time.  Snip across with scissors to make fine green ribbony shreds.
Chop the broccoli florets into very small pieces indeed, and bring a
large pan of salted water to the boil for cooking the pasta.

Melt 2 oz butter in a flameproof casserole suitable for bringing to
table. Add the broccoli, stir to coat with fat, cover with a lid and
cook gently for just 1 minute. Add a very generous grinding of
pepper, some salt and 2 teaspoons lemon juice (or quite a bit more
lemon if using spinach). Shake the casserole to distribute the
flavourings, then scatter the flaked fish over the broccoli but do
not stir it in.  Cover and leave over very gentle heat for just 3
minutes or so. Meanwhile cook the pasta.

Draw the casserole away from the heat.  Add the well drained pasta,
the Parmesan and most of the sorrel or spinach ribbons. Toss quickly,
gently and thoroughly so that every strand of pasta is anointed with
butter and prettily flecked with the pink and green of the salmon and
vegetables. Check the seasoning, sprinkle the remaining ribbons of
greenery over the top and serve straight away, accompanied by wedges
of lemon instead of the ubiquitous bowl of grated Parmesan cheese.

1/4 cup fresh lime juice

Spicy Sauteed Shrimp

lebanese, seafood

12  to 18 jumbo shrimp
1/2 cup pumpkin seeds (pepitas in mexican m; arkets)
1 small onion, cut into chunks
3  garlic cloves
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, leaves only
1 large tomato, peeled, cut into chunks
3  to 4 dried hot chiles *
1  red bell pepper, cut into chunks
1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
4 tablespoon olive oil
1  clam juice, if needed
1  juice of 1 lemon

* such as pequin, coarsely crushed (or 1 or 2 fresh chiles, such as
jalapeno or Serrano, coarsely chopped, with the seeds, if you like
your food hot)

This is from Narsai David, a cosmopolitan Lebanese restauranteur, food
writer and all-around nice guy from the Bay Area.

Clean, peel and devein the shrimp.  Set aside.

To make the sauce, prepare the pumpkin seeds first. If they are
unroasted, put them in a heavy skillet with out oil or butter and
toast them for a few minutes until they are crackly but not browned.
Put them in a food processor or blender and reduce to a fine powder.
Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, tomato, chiles, bell pepper,
coriander seeds, and salt and pepper.  Puree until smooth.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a skillet, add the pureed
pumpkin seed mixture, and cook gently for a few minutes, stirring
from time to time, until it is well blended. If too thick, stir in a
little clam juice; if too thin, continue to cook until it is reduced
to the desired consistency.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet, add the
shrimp, and saute over moderate heat until just beginning to turn
pink. Using a slotted spoon, remove from the pan to a heated platter.

Add the sauce to the pan.  Add the lemon juice and adjust the
seasoning. Return the shrimp to the pan, turning to coat them with
the sauce. Serve immediately.

Serves 6.

Spicy Stir-Fry Shrimp - Friday's Dinner Menu

low cal, low fat, main dish

1  onion
4 cup snow peas, trimmed
1/2 lb vermicelli noodles
2 teaspoon vegetable oil
3  garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoon gingerroot, minced
1 lb large shrimp, peel/devein
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 dash hot pepper sauce
2 tablespoon unsalted roast peanuts, chopped

Serve with: Green Salad with Low-fat Ranch Dressing Crispy Bread
Sticks Pears with Cheddar cheese Gingersnap cookies

A stir-fry with shrimp, vegetables and noodles that make a great
one-dish meal. When using a nonstick skillet to stir-fry, you need
only a tiny amount of oil. For dessert, cheese and pears round out
the four food groups in this meal. Gingersnap cookies are a good
choice since they satisfy a sweet craving but are lower in fat than
most types of cookie.

Sweet and spicy shrimp make an easy, impressive dinner. If you
prefer, you can use wide noodles.

Cut onion in half lengthwise; slice lengthwise into thin strips. Cut
snow peas in half diagonally; set aside.

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles for 7 minutes or
until tender but firm; drain.

Meanwhile, in nonstick wok or large skillet, heat oil over medium-high
heat; cook onion, garlic and ginger, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add
shrimp and snow peas; cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

In bowl, whisk together stock, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar,
cornstarch and hot pepper sauce; stir into shrimp mixture. Increase
heat to high; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until shrimp are firm
and pink and sauce is thickened.

Toss noodles with shrimp mixture. Sprinkle with peanuts.

Squid A La Abalonetti

seafood

2 lb squid, cleaned and cut open into fl; at pieces
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1  egg, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 cup cracker meal
1  oil

This recipe is from Abalonetti's, an Italian seafood restaurant on
Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey, Ca.  The specialty of the house is to
fix squid so as to be indistinguishable from abalone. They do a fine
job of it too!  I've gained many pounds from scarfing down their
excellent squid. It's plain, simple, to the point and very, very
good!!! Give this to those folks who say "Eeeauu, I HATE squid!".

Combine milk, egg, salt and pepper.  Dip squid in mixture and roll in
cracker meal.  Place squid in a single layer in hot oil in a 10-inch
frying pan.  Fry at a moderate heat until lightly browned. Turn
carefully. Cook the other side.  Drain on absorbent paper. Serve with
lemon wedges.

From "The International Squid Cookbook" by Isaac Cronin, Aris Books,
Berkeley.  1981.  ISBN 0-915572-61-3.

TIP:  Do NOT overcook the squid.  By the time the breading is nice and
golden, the squid should be done...

Squid In Its Own Ink (Chipirones En Su Tinta)

basque, seafood

2 lb small fresh whole
1  squid with ink sacs
1  onion, finely chopped
1 centiliter garlic, finely chopped
1  olive oil for frying
1  italian (flat) parsley,
1  chopped
1  bread crumbs
1  sauce:
1  onion, finely chopped
1 centiliter garlic, finely chopped
1  crust of bread
2 tablespoon fish broth
1  ink from the sacs
8 teaspoon tomato puree

These squid are also called Tripiroiak and Jibiones in various parts
of the Basque Country. In the rest of Spain, they are referred to as
calamares. Take apart and clean the fresh squid, taking care to
remove the ink sacs without breaking them. Set the ink sacs aside.
Cut the tentacles into one inch chunks.

Fry one onion and one garlic clove in olive oil. When the onion
begins to take on color, add the chunks of squid tentacles and cook
slowly while stirring in the oil. Add the chopped parsley and bread
crumbs and stir until well thickened.

Stuff the squid tails with this mixture, being careful not to
overfill. Seal the openings with a toothpick. Fry the stuffed tails
in a small amount of olive oil, turning gently, until golden in
color. Meanwhile make the ink sauce.

Ink Sauce:

Brown the other onion and garlic clove in olive oil, and add a crust
of bread. Place the fish broth in a small bowl. Place the reserved
ink sacs in a fine sieve our the bowl and puncture carefully. Blend
the ink and broth. Add this liquid to the onion and garlic and cook
slowly. Add the tomato puree and continue to simmer for a short time.
Run the mixture through a blender.

Place the sauce in a large skillet, add the fried, stuffed squid and
simmer for 15 minutes. Makes three to four servings. Walt

2 lb squid, cut into rings
1  onion, chopped
1/4 cup almonds
2  fresh chiles, finely chopped, or
1 teaspoon cayenne
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 teaspoon tamarind concentrate, dissolved in
2 tablespoon water, or
2 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon grass (dry), or
1  stalk fresh lemon grass, chopped
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon shrimp paste or *
1 teaspoon dried, salted shrimp
2 tablespoon vegetable oil

* (known as shrimp sauce in China),

This is probably the most exotic of these recipes.  No country of
origin is given, but from the name and the process it must be
Indonesian or Malaysian.

This dish has several unusual ingredients for which there are adequate
substitutes available.  In any case, all the exotic ingredients are
available at Chinese grocery.

In a food processor, purse the onion, almonds, chiles and shrimp
paste.

In a large, heavy frying pan or a wok, saute the spice paste in oil
over low heat.  When it turns dark brown, add tamarind water, the
lemon, lemon grass and sugar. Saute a minute more, then add the
squid. Turn up the heat and cook for 3 minutes, adding water if
necessary to keep the sauce from sticking.  Remove from heat and
serve over rice.

As a main course this dish serves 3; as a side dish, 6 or more.

Squid Saute

seafood

3 lb squid, cleaned and cut into rings
2 tablespoon parsley, chopped
4 tablespoon butter or olive oil
4  cloves garlic, minced (optional)
1  lemon wedges
1  salt and pepper to taste

The easiest and, many people think, the best way to prepare squid is
to saute it.  The basic recipe and variations provided here do not
begin to cover the many ways to saute squid. This dish takes 10
minutes or less to make once you have cleaned the squid.

If you are using garlic, saute it in 1 Tb of olive oil or butter in a
heavy frying pan over low heat until it is lightly browned. Turn up
to a medium-high flame. Add the rest of the oil, and when it is hot
the squid, parsley, salt and pepper.  Saute for 3 minutes.

Serve with lemon wedges and boiled or fried potatoes.

VARIATIONS:

1.  Add quartered, cooked artichoke hearts or coarsely sliced beets
along with the squid.

2.  Substitute 1 tsp of dried or fresh dill, or 2 Tbs of fresh basil
for parsley.

3.  Substitute 1 tsp cayenne for black pepper.

Squid Teriyaki

japanese, seafood

3 lb squid, cleaned and cut into rings
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup mirin, or 1/2 cup sherry
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1  juice of 2 lemons

To make the terriyaki sauce, combine all the ingredients except the
cornstarch.  Reserve half of the sauce, marinate the squid in the
other half for 1 hour.

Prepare the fire.  Skewer squid pieces and tentacles. Heat the
reserved terriyaki sauce in a saucepan.  When it begins to boil, add
the cornstarch dissolved in a little water. As soon as the sauce
thickens, remove from heat.  As it cooks you will baste the squid
with this terriyaki sauce.

Grill the squid until it turns dark brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side,
depending on the heat, and then turn it over. Baste one last time and
then remove skewers from the fire. Serve over rice accompanied with
any remaining sauce.

Starving Artists' Fish

fish

4  boneless skinless fish fillets
1 small jar artichoke hearts in oil
2 tablespoon sliced  almonds
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
1  tarragon or
1  thyme to taste
1  (tarragon is better,imo)
1  freshly ground pepper

The origin was when I was a college student (won't say how long ago).
We were all broke, except that one member of the group had a typical
Italian Mama who sent periodic care packages of exotic goodies.
Another member liked to fish, so we came up with:

Drain artichoke hearts, reserving oil.  Place oil in a small saucepan,
along with almonds, butter, cheese and herbs/spices. Heat until
flavors are well combined.

Meanwhile, place fish fillets in an ovenproof baking dish, folding if
necessary to make an attractive presentation. Chop artichoke hearts,
or arrange hearts to cover fish attractivelyu (a subject of some
debate, I vote for cutting the hearts into attractive portions, and
covering the fish)

Pour the oil/butter/cheese, etc. mixture over the fish, place in a
preheated 350 oven, and bake until the fish barely flakes. (10
minutes or less).

Serve with pasta dressed with oil, garlic and cheese, a green
vegetable. Kathy in Bryan, TX

familiar to those who hang out around Asian markets. This calls for
the latter type.

In separate bowls, soak the mushrooms in warm water and the bean
threads in hot water until soft, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the
mushrooms, discard the stems, and toss the caps with a teaspoon of
soy sauce. Drain the bean threads and place in a deep heat-proof
plate or glass pie pan that will fit inside a wok or other steaming
pot.

Arrange the fish on top, tucking the mushroom caps in around them.
Pour in the chicken stock, scatter the green onion and ginger on top
of the fish, and sprinkle with the remaining soy sauce.

Bring the water in the steamer to a rolling boil and place the plate
on a rack an inch above the water. Cover and steam for 20 minutes.
Sprinkle with the sesame oil and serve from the steaming dish. Serves
2 to 3 as a main dish, 4 with other dishes.

Steamed Clams

appetizers, fish, main dish, microwave

2 lb steamers
1/4 cup water

1. Place steamers and 1/4 cup water in a cooking bag. 2. Tie the top
of the bag with string. Do not use metal fasteners. 3. Pierce 3 holes
near the top of the bag to allow the steam to escape. 4. Heat in
Microwave Oven 6 minutes or until shells open. Tip: The live clams
can be placed in a shallow pan with enough water to cover. Sprinkle a
handful of cornmeal over them and let stand a few hours or overnight.
They will absorb the cornmeal into their systems and it will clean
out any sand as well as help in whitening the clam meat.

Steamed Fresh Crab In Curry Sauce

chinese, seafood

1 large whole fresh crab
6  slices ginger root
2 tablespoon dry sherry
3  spring onions or chinese
1  parsley
      ----SAUCE----
1/2  bell pepper, diced
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 cup stock
1 teaspoon ginger, minced
1  clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoon peanut oil
1  cornstarch paste

Make Sauce:  Heat oil in medium-hot saucepan.  Saute minced garlic
until fragrant.  Add curry powder.  Stir over medium heat for about 1
minute - avoid burning powder. Add stock, salt, sugar and ginger;
bring to boil; cook for 1 minute.  Add bell pepper, which has been
coarsely diced into 1/4" squares; stir in enough thin cornstarch
paste to make a light sauce. As soon as sauce thickens, remove from
heat and reserve. This sauce can be made up ahead and reheated just
before serving.

Clean & Steam Crab:  Pry off plate from crab in one piece. Separate
legs with cleaver; wash all parts, cleaning out junk; cut soft inner
sections of legs into manageable pieces. Carefully crack claws,
keeping them intact. Reassemble crab on oval platter. Before putting
on back, sprinkle meat with dry sherry; lay ginger on top; then put
on back plate. Wash green onions, remove roots, and shred, greens and
all, into 2" sections.

Bring water in steamer to rolling boil.  Steam crab for about 15-20
minutes, depending on size. Meanwhile, reheat curry sauce (or keep
hot in double boiler). Remove steamed crab from steamer; drain excess
water. Lift back plate off crab; pour curry sauce over crab; sprinkle
with onion shreds; return back plate. Serve.

2 tablespoon hoisin sauce
2 teaspoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon finely grated orange peel
1 1/3 lb rockfish fillets
8  spinach leaves, stems removed, wash; ed and patted dry

for this purpose. Or use a bamboo steamer.) Cover with foil and steam
12 minutes per inch of thickness, or until the fish tests done (140
degrees on an instant read thermometer).

Serve with the lemon wedges.

Note: The same type of cooking preparation can be used for steaming
the fish simply with a little soy sauce, a sprinkling of orange or
lemon juice, and thinly sliced green onions.

Steamed Salmon Dinner For Two

fish

      ----INGREDIENTS----
2 each unpeeled, red-skinned
1  potatoes (about 1/2 lb)
2 each salmon steaks, (about 6 oz
1  each), 1 inch thick
4 each thin slices of lemon
24 each snow peas, (about 3 oz)
6 each small oyster mushrooms or
1  other fresh mushrooms:
1  optional
      ----ZESTY DILL SAUCE----
1/4 cup light sour cream
1 tablespoon reduced-calorie mayonnaise
1 each small green onion, finely
1  chopped.
2 teaspoon chopped dill or
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon dijon mustard
1 each grated peel of one lemon
      ----PREPARATION----

Cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/4 inch slices.

Spray a steamer rack, opened flat, with nonstick vegetable cooking
spray. Place rack in a large saucepan or dome-lidded, deep electric
skillet. Add water to a depth of 1 to 1 1/4 inches.  Bring to boiling.

Arrange potato slices over one-third of the rack. Cover and steam for
eight minutes.  Add salmon steaks and top each with two lemon slices.
Cover and steam for six minutes more. Add snow peas and mushrooms.
Cover and steam four to five minutes longer or until fish flakes
easily with fork and vegetables are tender.

Divide onto two dinner plates or arrange on a large serving platter.
Garnish with fresh dill, if desired. Serve with Zesty Dill Sauce.

Zesty Dill Sauce preparation: In a small bowl, combine all
ingredients for sauce. Makes about six tablespoons sauce. Nutritional
information: One tablespoon of the dill sauce contains 30 calories, 3
grams of fat and 1 milligram of cholesterol.

Cook's Notes:  A 5 1/2 inch collapsible metal steamer, opened flat,
works well in a large saucepan or deep skillet. When adding foods,
cover and adjust heat to maintain water at vigorous boil. so the pan
is filled continuously with steam. Steam can burn so remove the lid
by tilting it away from your face.  Use hot pads and remove food
carefully. Check water level when steaming foods that require longer
cooking times. If necessary, add boiling water to maintain steaming
process.

Menu suggestion:  Serve with a salad of assorted salad greens (Bibb,
romaine, curly red or green lettuce) in individual salad bowls. Top
with cucumber slices and fresh grapefruit segments. Serve the salad
with your favorite reduced-calorie creamy cucumber or Italian salad
dressing.

Steamed Salmon With Black Beans

seafood, steamed

1 lb salmon fillets or steaks
3 teaspoon dry sherry
1 teaspoon grated, peeled fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  garlic clove, pureed
2 tablespoon thinly sliced scallions
1 tablespoon fermented black beans, coarsely cho; pped
1 teaspoon sesame seed oil
1  cilantro or parsley sprigs, for gar; nish

Place the fish in a heat-proof dish at least 1" deep. (If you are
using a fillet, place it skin side down.) Stir together the Sherry,
ginger, salt and garlic in a small bowl. Pour this mixture onto the
fish and rub generously on both sides. Let stand at least 15 minutes.

Spread the scallions and beans evenly on top of the dish. Drizzle with
sesame seed oil.

Bring the water in the steamer to a vigorous boil. Place the dish on
the steamer tray and cover. Steam about 10 minutes, checking for
doneness after about 8 minutes. The fish will look opaque and feel
springy to the touch. It is better to undercook slightly than to
overcook; the heat in the fish will finish the cooking. Serve
immediately

Steamed Whole Fish

chinese, seafood

2 lb whole fish (cleaned weight)
1  rock cod, flounder, pomfret
2 teaspoon salt
4  scallions
1 tablespoon ginger slivers
1 cup stock
1 tablespoon dry gin
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1  cornstarch paste
2 tablespoon peanut oil
1  sprig chinese parsley

For more people, use more than one fish.  Each fish should be no more
than 2 lbs. unless you have a very large steamer. Have your
fishmonger clean and scale fish, leaving head and fins intact. You
can tell if fish is fresh by the clearness of the eyes and a red tint
on the inner edge of the gills. Wash and pat dry, rub with salt.
Allow to stand at room temperature for
30    minutes.

On both sides of fish, make parallel diagonal cuts 1" apart through
meaty section.  Trim and shred scallions diagonally in 2" lengths.
Peel and shred fresh ginger root. Place pieces of scallion and ginger
in cuts.

Place fish on greased plate.  Steam at rapid boil for 15 to 25
minutes, depending on size.  Fish is cooked when you can flake flesh.
Overcooking will toughen flesh, so watch closely.

Heat peanut oil in beaker or small saucepan.  In wok, heat stock, gin
and sugar.   When fish is cooked, remove from steamer. Drain juices
into stock mixture. Thicken slightly with cornstarch paste. Pour hot
oil, then stock mixture, over fish.  Garnish with Chinese parsley.

Stegt Rodspaette (Saut‚ed Flounder W/Shrimp)

main dish, seafood

4  flounder fillets, 1/2 lb ea.
1  salt
1  flour
1/2 cup bread crumbs; dried
2 medium eggs
2 tablespoon water
8 tablespoon butter (1 stick)
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 lb shrimp; cooked, small, peeled and
1  lemon wedges

"Plaice is the fish the Danes usually prepare in this manner, but
flounder is an excellent American substitute. Danish shrimp are the
1" variety similar to U.S. West Coast shrimp. Choose the smallest
fresh shrimp available." Rince the fish in cold water and pat dry
with paper towels. Salt lightly, dip in flour and shake off excess.
Spread the bread crumbs on wax paper. In a mixing bowl beat the eggs
together with 2 tablespoons of water, then dip each fillet into the
egg mixture and coat each side thoroughly with the bread crumbs. Let
them rest for at least 10 minutes before cooking. Heat 2 tablespoons
of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy 10-12" skillet over
moderate heat. Add the shrimp and toss them in the butter for 2 to 3
minutes until well coated. Place a line of the shrimp down the center
of each fillet. Melt the remaining butter over low heat until it
turns a rich, nutty brown, pour over the fish fillets and garnish
with lemon wedges. If you prefer, serve with a parsley sauce (see
recipe) in place of the shrimp and brown butter.

Stekt Marinert Makrell (Grilled Marinated Mac

main dish, norwegian, seafood

2 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  black pepper, fresh ground
2 teaspoon onion; finely chopped
2  mackerel (1 lb each)
1 1/2 tablespoon butter; melted
1 1/2 tablespoon oil (combine w/butter)

Remove the backbones from the fish without cutting them in half, or
have your fish dealer remove them. Preheat broiler. In a shallow
baking dish large enough to hold the fish laid out flat in one layer,
combine the oil, lemon juice, salt, black pepper and onions. Place
the mackerel in this marinade, flesh side down for 15 minutes, then
turn them over for another 15 minutes. Brush the broiler grill with 1
tablespoon of melted butter and oil and place the mackerel on it,
skin side down. Grill only one side about 3" from heat, basting from
time to time with remaining butter and oil. In 10 to 12 minutes they
should have turned a light golden color and their flesh should flake
easily when prodded with a fork. Serve at once, accompanied by
butter-steamed new potatoes and tomato or horse-radish butter. (See
recipes.)

Stewed Cauliflower In Cream Sauce

chinese, seafood

2 cup cauliflower florets
1/2 cup unpeeled canned straw
1  mushrooms
3  green onions
1  clove garlic, smashed
1 teaspoon tientsin cabbage
1  shrimp or crab meat (opt)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon peanut oil
1/2 teaspoon peanut oil
1  cornstarch paste
      ----SAUCE----
2/3 cup stock
1 teaspoon dry sherry
1/4 cup milk

Preparation:  Wash cauliflower, and cut florets about twice the size
of straw mushrooms.  Dice green onions into 1/4" pieces. Mix stock &
sherry.

Cooking:  Heat first oil to medium hot.  Add garlic & stir for about
30 seconds.  Remove garlic before it begins to brown. Turn heat high;
add cauliflower. Stir-fry for about 1 minute. Add onion, salt &
sugar; stir- fry 30 seconds.  Stir in Tientsin cabbage.  If desired,
add shrimp or crab meat.

Immediately add stock & sherry; bring sauce to boil, mixing with
cauliflower.  Cover & simmer 4 minutes. Remove lid; thicken with
cornstarch.  Sauce should be very heavy, so that when milk is added,
it will thin slightly, but still have body. Bring sauce back to boil;
slowly add milk while stirring. Add remaining peanut oil for a final
glaze. Serve.

Stewed Mushrooms & Queens

appetizers, seafood

1/2 lb mushrooms
1/2 lb queens (bay scallops)
1/4 pint milk
1/4 pint single cream or jersey milk
1  tarragon vinegar
1  anchovy essence
1 small bay leaf
1  fresh parsley
1 1/2 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 tablespoon flour
1  fried breadcrumbs or triangles of f; ried bread

Slice the mushrooms thickly.  Put them into a pan with the cold milk
(and cream if using).  Three-quarters cover the pan and bring quickly
to a fast simmer.
Add the bay leaf and a little salt and reduce the heat to very low.
Three-quarters cover the pan again and leave to stew gently for 5-6
minutes.  Strain to separate the liquid from the mushrooms, discard
the bay leaf and keep the mushrooms warm in a very low oven. Make a
smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour and creamy mushroom cooking
liquor. Stir in at least 1/2 teaspoon each tarragon vinegar and
anchovy essence. Leave to simmer for 2-3 minutes then season to taste
with salt and pepper. Quickly stir in the queens and immediately
reduce heat to low. Half cover the pan and cook for just 5 minutes.
Stir occasionally during this time and be sure to keep the heat very
low - only a very occasional bubble should break the surface of the
sauce or the shellfish may toughen. Draw the pan away from the heat,
quickly stir in the mushrooms and check seasoning. Then turn the
contents of the pan into a warmed gratin dish (or divide it between
warmed scallop shells for an elegant first course). Sprinkle with
parsley and garnish with fried crumbs or triangles of fried bread.
Serve alone as a first course, or as a main course accompanied by
some green beans and a little rice or a loaf of warm French bread.
Serves 2 as a greedy feast, 3 as a main course, or 6 as an appetizer.

Stir Fried Two Noodles (Hokkien Mee)

fish, meats, pasta

1  stephen ceideburg
1 cup water
1 cup basic chicken stock
1 tablespoon light or dark soy sauce
1/2 lb pork shoulder, in one piece
1/4 lb squid, cleaned and cut up
1/4 lb raw shrimp in the shell
2 tablespoon oil or lard
3  unpeeled cloves garlic, crushed
6 oz thin egg noodles, boiled, drained,; and tossed in a
1 tablespoon oil
4 oz thick rice sticks (see note), soake; d and drained
2 cup bean sprouts
1/4 cup chinese chives or garlic chives, cu; t into 1-inch lengths

This is a favorite street snack among the Chinese in many Southeast
Asian cities. Hokkien is the local pronunciation of Fujian (Fukien)
province in southeast China, the origin of many Chinese emigrants
over the years. In a typical noodle-vendor's stand, the pork and
shellfish are cooked in a stock that simmers for hours, picking up
more flavor all the time. In this home version, the extra flavor
comes from reducing the stock after cooking the meats.

1. In a small saucepan combine water, stock, soy sauce, and pork.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until meat is tender. Remove
meat and set aside. Return stock to a boil. Add squid and cook 30
seconds. Remove and set aside. Cook shrimp 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and
set aside, reserving stock. Peel shrimp and devein if necessary. (For
additional flavor, add shrimp shells to stock and simmer 10 minutes
longer.)

2. Bring stock to a boil and reduce by half. Strain stock. (The
recipe may be prepared to this point several hours ahead.)

3. Slice pork into bite-sized pieces. In a wok or large skillet, heat
oil or lard and garlic to near smoking. Remove and discard garlic
cloves when they brown. Add noodles and rice sticks and stir-fry
until they are lightly browned in places. Add stock, cover, and cook
2 minutes. Remove cover, add pork, squid, shrimp, and bean sprouts,
and continue stirring and cooking until noodles have absorbed' most
of the liquid, about two minutes. @1'transfer to serving platter and
garnish with Chinese chives.

Serves 4 with other dishes.

Note: The authentic rice noodle for this dish is a thicker rice stick
called laifen in China and pancit luglug in the Phil- ippines, but
ordinary thin rice sticks may be used.

Stir-Fried Scallops In A Basket

chinese, seafood

12  fresh scallops (or prawns,
1  chicken breast, or fish balls)
12 slice giant bamboo shoot
12 slice carrot
12  fresh snow peas or thinly sliced br; occoli
2 cup shredded lettuce
2 medium potatoes
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cup oil for deep frying
3 slice fresh ginger
1  clove garlic, crushed
2 tablespoon peanut oil
1 pinch salt
2/3 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoon gin
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
2 teaspoon thin soy sauce
1  cornstarch paste

Contrasting texture, color and appearance are hallmarks of this im-
pressive banquet dish.

Preparation:  Slice bamboo shoot across grain into 2" triangles. Peel
& slice carrots on bias.  Remove strings from peas & wash. If substi-
tuting broccoli, use peeled stems only; slice thinly on bias. Shred
lettuce; arrange like nest on round 10" serving plate.

Making Potato Basket:  Peel, then coarsely shred potatoes. Or, slice
potatoes into thin matchsticks. Rinse potatoes in cold water twice;
soak them 30 minutes in cold salted water; rinse & drain. Slowly heat
deep-frying oil in wok to medium hot; test potato slice: it should
brown in 30 seconds.  Dust potatoes with cornstarch so they will
stick together when fried.  Arrange them in a cross-hatch pattern on
Chinese wire strainer or other suitable strainer to form deep basket.
Press them in position with another strainer. If you use bowl for
pressing, heat it first, because you don't want to cool frying oil.
Immerse in oil & deep-fry until potatoes begin to brown. Remove from
oil; take away top strainer only; drain; reserve.

When ready to serve, heat oil to very hot, but not smoking; deep-fry
potatoes in strainer again until they are brown & crisp. Place basket
in nest of lettuce.

Blanching:  Dip scallops in hot but not boiling water; remove in 15
seconds when scallops are warmed: don`t allow them to cook.

Stir-frying:  As you heat wok to medium hot, stir-fry ginger slices &
garlic to flavor wok; remove when they start to brown; discard. When
wok is hot, add peanut oil & salt; stir. Add bamboo shoots & carrots;
stir-fry 1 minute.  Add stock.  When stock boils, add scallops, snow
peas, sugar, white pepper, gin & soy sauce. Stir 1 minute. Add
cornstarch paste to thicken. Transfer to potato basket. Serve.

Stir-Fried Scallops With Leeks

oriental, seafood

1 lb fresh scallops
1 lb leeks
1 1/2 tablespoon oil, preferably peanut
2 tablespoon scallions; coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon garlic; coarsely chopped
2 teaspoon fresh ginger; finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
      ----SAUCE----
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
2 teaspoon chili bean sauce
2 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry
2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon sesame oil

If the scallops are very large, cut them in half. They are cooked
when they are slightly firm to the touch. I find scallops at their
best when they are just barely cooked through.

DRY THE SCALLOPS WITH PAPER TOWELS and set aside. Trim the leeks and
discard any yellow parts. Cut the leeks at the point where they begin
to turn green and discard the green parts. Split the white parts in
half. Cut the white parts of the leeks at a slight diagonal into
2-inch segments. Wash them well, several times, in cold water. Heat a
wok or large frying pan until it is hot, then add the oil, leeks,
scallions, garlic, ginger and salt and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the
sauce ingredients and stir-fry the mixture for 3 minutes. Lastly, add
the scallops and continue to stir-fry for 4 more minutes, or until
the scallops are just cooked. Serve at once.

Stir-Fried Shrimp With Garlic & Green Beans

seafood

1 lb large shrimp with shells
1 cup ; water
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
3  cloves garlic; sliced
1/2 teaspoon ; salt (optional)
2 tablespoon dry sherry
2 teaspoon sesame oil
3/4 lb green beans; trimmed
2 tablespoon peanut oil
2 tablespoon garlic; minced
1 tablespoon fresh ginger; peeled and minced
1/2 teaspoon chili-garlic paste*
1/4 cup scallions; minced, use both green an
1  juice of 1/2 lime

*Available in Asian markets.

Peel the shrimp and simmer the shells for 5 minutes or so in the water
while you work on the rest of the recipe. Marinate the shrimp in a
mixture of 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, the
sliced garlic, salt, sherry, and 1 teaspoon of the sesame oil while
you assemble the other ingredients. Drain the shrimp shells,
reserving 3/4 cup of the stock.

If the green beans are tough, parboil them for 1 minute or so, then
plunge them into ice water.  If they are large, cut them into pieces.
When you are ready to cook, preheat a wok or 12-inch skillet over
medium-high heat for 3 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil
and raise the heat to medium high. When it begins to smoke, add the
minced garlic and, immediately thereafter, the shrimp and its
marinade. Cook the shrimp about 1 minute per side.  Spoon it out of
the wok or skillet.

Put the remaining peanut oil in the wok, still over high heat, and
when it smokes, add the ginger, followed immediately by the green
beans. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they are lightly browned, 3
to 5 minutes, then add the shrimp stock and let it bubble away for 1
or 2 minutes. Return the shrimp to the wok and stir; add the
chili-garlic paste, the scallions, and the remaining sugar and soy
sauce. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Turn off the heat, drizzle with
the lime juice and the remaining sesame oil, and serve. Serves 4
people. Adapted recipe from: Fish, the Complete Guide to Buying and
Serving, by Mark Bittman.

1  deveined
1 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoon salad oil

Stir-Fried Squid With Peanuts & Chiles

chinese, seafood

1 lb squid, cleaned chinese-style [see b; elow. s.c.]
1/4 cup raw peanuts, roughly chopped
4  cloves garlic, minced
1  or more fresh chile peppers, choppe; d
1 teaspoon cilantro, chopped (optional)
2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 cup chicken stock
1 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved in
1 tablespoon stock or water
3 tablespoon to 4 tb vegetable oil

In traditional Chinese cooking, dishes which are part of a banquet-
style meal usually contain about 1 pound of food. This dish will
serve 4 if there are 3 other dishes besides soup; 6 if there are 6
other dishes, etc.

Saute garlic and chile peppers in half the oil over low heat in a wok
or heavy frying pan until garlic is lightly browned. Add peanuts for
the last 30 seconds. Stir continuously.

Remove ingredients from the pan, add more oil, if necessary, and the
squid. Cook for 30 seconds.  Return peanuts, garlic and chiles to
pan. Immediately add all but 1 Tb of the stock, soy sauce and
cilantro.

Continue stir-frying for another minute.  Add cornstarch mixture. When
sauce thickens, remove from heat and serve.

[Score squid diagonally at three quarter inch intervals. Turn and
repeat at right angles to original cuts. Don't cut all the way
through the squid body.  Cut each scored squid body into three or
four pieces.

When cooked, the squid will roll up and the crosshatching will catch
and hold the sauce.  It's much easier to do than to describe. S.C.]

Streamside Trout

fish

2  whole dressed trout; -or- trout fillets
1  salt and pepper
1/2 cup cornmeal
1  cooking oil

I call this one Streamside trout because it is so basic that you can
do it along your favorite trout stream on your camp stove. It basic,
also, because you don't have to do too much to trout or any fish when
they are that fresh.

Put salt, pepper and cornmeal in paper bag. Drop trout in bag and
shake vigorously to coat with mixture. Place in hot frying pan and
cook until golden brown.

Studynyna Rybiacha (Fish In Aspic)

christmas, fish, main dish, russian

1 large firm fleshed fish; (white fish, canadian sol
3  fish heads and trimmings
2 large onions
2 large carrots
4  black peppercorns; to taste
1 large bay leaf
2 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg plain geletin; (1 envelope)

Wast the whole fish and fish heads in cold water.  Run a knife over
the fish, scraping from tail to head, to remove any leftover scales.
Rinse the gut cavity. Cut off the head at the gills, rinse again and
cut into equal pieces.  Rub inside and out with salt and set aside.
Remove the gills from the heads.  Combine the fish heads, tail, fins
and all ingredients in a 4 quart pot, then cover with 6 cups of cold
water. Bring to a boil, skimming off the foam, then reduce to a
gentle simmer. Cook for 20 minutes or until the heads are cooked
through. Using a small sieve, lined with a wet towel or cheesecloth,
pour the liquid into a 2 quart jar. When most is poured off, press
lightly on the remains and pour off the rest. Place the sections of
fish in about 2 cups of stock.  Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for
about 10 minutes or until the fish turns white. Do NOT overcook or
the pieces will fall apart. With a slotted spoon, remove the fish
pieces and place on a platter to cool.  When cool enough to handle,
remove the skin and bones trying to keep the pieces large and not
ragged. Cover and cool. Strain the cooking liquid again and add to
the rest of the stock. For a more intense flavor, stock may be
reheated and reduced by a third. Dissolve the gelatin in 1 cup of
fish tock and add. Taste and add salt if needed. Cool.  Pour in
enough stock to cover the bottom of a 6 cup fish mold or glass pan by
1/2 inch. Reftigerate until set. Remove the peel from thecooked
carrots and slice them into thin rounds. Arrange the carrot rounds in
an attractive pattern on the aspic, add a little more cooled stock,
and cool until set. Evenly spread the fish pieces over the aspic,
covering with more stock, cooling until set. Continue to add stock
until the fish is completely covered. Refrigerate overnight.

TO SERVE:

Run a sharp knife around the edge of the mold.  Place a platter on
top of the mold and invert.  (A hot damp cloth helps to release it.)
Garnish with parsley sprigs and lemon slices just before serving.

Stuffed Fillets Of Sole With Mushroom Sauce

appetizers, fish, main dish, microwave

1  butter or margarine
2 1/2 lb salmon-stuffed sole fillets
1  salt and pepper, to taste
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup dry white wine
1/3 cup butter or margarine
1 cup thin sliced fresh mushrooms
4 tablespoon flour
1 1/2 cup light cream
1  paprika

1. Butter a shallow, heat-resistant, non-metallic baking dish lightly.
Place stuffed-sole fillets in baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper to taste. 2. Sprinkle onions over fish fillets and pour wine
over fish. Heat, covered with clear plastic wrap, in Microwave Oven 7
to 8 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Baste fish with
wine and onions several times during cooking. Set poached fish aside.
3. In a medium-sized, heat-resistant, non-metallic bowl melt the 1/3
cup butter or margarine in Microwave Oven 45 seconds. Add mushroom
slices and heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven 2 minutes. 4. Blend in
flour until smooth. Gradually add cream, stirring until smooth.
Return sauce to Microwave Oven and heat, uncovered, 4 to 5 minutes or
until mixture is thickened and smooth. Stir occasionally. 5. Add 1/2
cup fish liquid from baking dish to mushroom sauce and stir until
well blended. 6. Place fish fillets on a heat-resistant, non-metallic
serving platter. Spoon mushroom sauce over fish. Heat, uncovered, in
Microwave Oven 2 to 3 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with
paprika just before serving. Note: Many fish markets sell sole
pre-stuffed with salmon However, if this is not available, you can
roll a piece of fresh salmon (about 1-inch in diameter and 4-inches
long) in a small fillet. Fasten each roll with a toothpick. Unstuffed
sole or sole that has been stuffed with shrimp, clams, scallops or
crabmeat can also be used for this recipe. It is advisable to roll
sole fillets even though they may not be stuffed.

Stuffed Squid With Chocolate Sauce

fish

1  stephen ceideburg
1 lb squid, cleaned, dried
1/2 lb ground pork
1  olive oil
1  onion, finely diced
1 small carrot, finely diced
2  garlic cloves, minced
2  parsley sprigs, minced
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup pine nuts, lightly toasted
1  salt, pepper
1 cup fish, shellfish or chicken stock
1/2 cup dry white wine
10  to 12 almonds, blanched, roasted
1 oz lbarra brand chocolate, coarsely gr; ated (see note)
2 slice fried crustless french bread (not s; ourdough)

Adapted from "Catalan Cuisine " by Colman Andrews.

Remove heads and tentacles from squid and set bodies aside. Mince
heads and tentacles, then mix well with the ground pork (may use a
food processor).

Heat about 1/2 inch of olive oil in a cassola (like a cazuela, the
straight-sided pottery vessel used for paella and other dishes in
Spain) or large skillet and saute the onion, carrot, garlic and
parsley in it until the onions are wilted; add the pork mixture,
crumbs and half the pine nuts, mixing together well and cooking until
the meat is well done. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then
remove mixture from pan and drain on paper towels or in a colander.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

When the pork mixture is cool, lightly stuff the reserved squid
bodies with it (do not overstuff, or the squid will shrink and tear
during cooking). Bake the squid in a single layer, uncovered, in a
lightly oiled baking dish for about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, deglaze the cassola with the stock and wine, simmering
until it is reduced by about half. While the liquid reduces, put the
almonds, remaining pine nuts, chocolate and fried bread in a mortar
and pound with a pestle until finely ground, then moisten with a bit
of the liquid to make a thick paste (it must be fine, without grainy
texture). Add this mixture to the reduced liquid, stir in well,
return to the boil and season to taste. Pour over the stuffed squid,
or spoon onto serving plates and set the squid on top of the sauce.

Note: lbarra chocolate is sweetened and flavored with almonds and
cinnamon and is available in many markets in the Bay Area.

Stuffed Squid With Vinegar/Soy Dip

ethnic, seafood, seasonings

2 lb small squid
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 oz lean ground beef
1 cup chopped cabbage
1 cup chopped fresh bean sprouts
3 tablespoon finely chopped green onions
1 teaspoon crushed garlic
3  dried chinese mushrooms,  soaked
1 1/4 tablespoon light soy sauce
2 teaspoon sesame oil
1  salt and white pepper
      ----VINEGAR/SOY DIP----
3/4 cup light soy sauce
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup white sesame seeds, toasted and gro; und
2 teaspoon finely chopped green onions

Clean the squid under running water.  Remove clear inner quill, pull
away the head and tentacles, then cut off the tentacles just above
the head. Pull off the skin, discarding the little flaps. Wash squid
thoroughly. Very finely chop the tentacles and saute in the vegetable
oil with the meat, cabbage, bean sprouts, green onion and garlic.

Drain the mushrooms, squeeze out as much water as possible, remove the
stems and chop the caps finely. Add to the pan and stir fry for 1
minute, then add the soy sauce, sesame oil, salt and pepper.

Fill the squid with the prepared stuffing, securing the opening with
wooden picks.  Set in a lightly oiled dish, sprinkle on a little
extra sesame oil and steam over rapidly boiling water for about 20
minutes. Remove from the steamer, cut the squid into thick slices and
serve with Vinegar/Soy Dip.

Alternatively, the squid can be steamed for 10 minutes, then
deep-fried until crisp and golden on the surface in a mixture of 4
parts vegetable oil to 1 part sesame oil.

Vinegar/Soy Dip:  Mix all ingredients.  The sauce keeps for several
days in the refrigerator without the green onions, one day with the
green onions.

Succulent Salmon  (C) 1992 George Gilder

seafood

10 oz salmon fillet
1  (remove the skin)
2 medium red potatoes
1 large onions, sliced 1/4 inch
8  baby carrots or 8 carrot
1  sections, cut into 2
1  pieces
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
1  broccoli, cut into florets
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon basil
1 pkg herb-ox low salt
1  chicken stock mix
1  salt, pepper,to taste

This is a new adaptation from a series of fish recipes I developed for
"people who don't like fish". The stock and juice combined with the
onion add a distinctive savory flavor. The combination makes it hard
to distinguish the individual flavors. This dinner takes less than
ten minutes to complete.

Cut the potatoes into one quarter inch slices and place into a pan of
cold water. Turn pot on high until it starts to boil. Add the carrots
after three minutes. Salt the water and reduce heat to medium. Cook
until tender, about six to seven minutes. Add broccoli about 2
minutes before the potatoes are finished. Drain if finished before
the fish, and place back in hot pan. Add fresh pepper.

Saute onions in one half the oil, med-low heat in a ten inch teflon
pan. When they start to brown add the rest of oil. Place the fish
fillet on top fat side down and turn up heat to med- high. Saute
until salmon turns white on bottom. Add herbs and pepper. Add one
quarter cup of water, chicken stock and the orange juice. Lower heat
and simmer about five minutes. Baste occasionally. The salmon should
be pink inside and not over done.

Cut the filet in half in the pan. Using a plastic spatula, pick up
the fish and onions and place in one half of plate. Add a spoon or
two of sauce. Add vegetables and arrange in semi-circle.

Sugar & Spice Salmon

fish, main dish

3/4 cup gin
1/3 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoon coarse salt
1 1/2 tablespoon mixed pickling spice
1 teaspoon anise seed, bruised*
1 teaspoon dil seed, bruised*
1 1/2 lb salmon filet

At least 2 hours and up to 6 hours before you plan to smoke the fish,
combine marinade ingrdients in a bowl. Place salmon in a plastic bag
or shallow dish, pour marinade over it, and refrigerate it for at
least 1 hour.

Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature.

Remove salmon from refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature
for 30 minutes.  Drain salmon, reserving marinade. Leave any clinging
spices on the surface of the salmon.

Transfer salmon to smoker, skin-side down, and drizzle marinade (with
some of the whole spices) generously over fish. Smoke it until just
cooked through and flaky, about 45 to 55 minutes at a temperature of
225 to 250F.
Have a large spatula and platter ready when you take the salmon off
the smoker, since it will be fragile when done.

Transfer salmon to the serving platter.  Serve it hot or chilled with
some of the whole spices clinging to the fish.

*Bruising technique:  Bruising spices means to almost ~ but not quite
~ crush the whole spice seeds or pods. by pressing on the spices with
a pestle or the side of a knife, you release the natural oils, making
the seasonings more flavorful.

Sweet & Sour Fish

chinese, seafood

1 1/4 lb firm white fish fillets, such as co; d, sea bass, or
1  halibut, cut into 1 1/2 x 2 inch st; rips
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1  sweet and sour sauce
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup chinese pickled cucumber (optional)
3 tablespoon ketchup
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 pinch white pepper
1  flour for dry-coating
1  egg, lightly beaten
1  cornstarch for dry-coating
1  vegetable oil for deep-frying
1/2 small carrot, cut into match-stick pieces
1  green onion (including top) cut int; o 2-inch slivers
2 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon; water

Some cooks are surprised to see ketchup used in Chinese cooking. They
might be less surprised if they knew that the name (and the
condiment) came from Asia in the first place. "Ketjap" (or "kecap",
both pronounced the same) is a Malay word meaning "seasoned Sauce."

Preparation:

Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper and set aside.

Combine sweet and sour sauce ingredients in a medium bowl and set
aside.

Place flour, egg and cornstarch in separate bowls. Coat each piece of
fish with flour, shaking off excess. Dip fish in egg, then dredge with
cornstarch. Set aside for 10 minutes.

Cooking:

Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.
Over high heat, bring oil to 360 deg.F. Add fish,a few pieces at a
time, and cook for 4 minutes or until golden brown. Lift out and
drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a 200 deg.F oven while cooking
remaining fish.

Bring sauce to a boil over medium-high heat. Add carrot and green
onion and cook for 30 seconds. Add cornstarch solution and cook,
stirring until sauce boils and thickens.

Pour sauce on a platter. Arrange fish over sauce and serve
immediately.

Swordfish Steaks With Oil & Lemon Sauce

fish, sauces

2 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon oregano
1/4 cup olive oil
2 lb swordfish,cut into 1/2-in
1  pepper,black

1. Preheat the broiler, or prepare charcoal for grilling. 2. Combine
the lemon juice and oregano in a small mixing bowl. Blend well, then
gradually add the oil while stirring with a whisk. Add a generous
amount of black pepper. This sauce is known as a Salmoriglio sauce.
3. When the broiler or charcoal grill is quite hot, place the fish
steaks under the broiler or on the grill. The fish should be quite
close to the source of heat so that it will cook quickly. 4. Cook
about 1 min. on one side, then turn the fish steaks carefully but
quickly and cook about 1 min. or slightly longer on the other side.
Do not overcook or the fish steaks will become dry. 5. Transfer the
fish steaks to a warmed platter and ladle the sauce over them.

This dish is named: Pesce al salmoriglio

Swordfish With Charred Tomato Vinaigrette

fish

2 large vine-ripened tomatoes
1/4 cup olive oil
1  freshly ground black pepper
1 small onion; peeled and sliced
1  jalapeno pepper; cored and sliced
1  clove garlic; minced
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1  kosher salt (optional)
2 tablespoon fresh basil; chopped
4  swordfish steaks (6 oz each) cut at; least 2 inches thick
3 tablespoon parsley chopped

Core the tomatoes and cut them into thick slices. Brush both sides of
the slices with oil and season generously with pepper.

Heat a large cast-iron or heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until
hot. Lay the tomato slices in the pan in one layer and cook for 2 to
3 minutes on each side to char. Lift the tomato slices from the pan
and set aside on a plate.  Repeat the procedure until all the slices
have been charred.

Put the onion slices in the same pan and cook over high heat for 2 to
3 minutes, stirring, until the onions begin to brown. Add the chopped
basil and keep warm. Season the swordfish steaks with a little salt
and pepper. Brush both sides of each with the remaining oil.

Heat the same or another large cast-iron or heavy-bottomed skillet
over high heat until hot. Alternately, prepare a charcoal, wood, or
gas grill or preheat a broiler.  Cook the swordfish for 3 to 4
minutes to a side for medium.  Do not overcook.  Put a swordfish
steak in the center of each plate and spoon the warm tomato
vinaigrette over it. Sprinkle with parsley. Source:  Hearth-Healthy

Szechuan-Style Sliced Fish

chinese, seafood

1 lb fresh red snapper or grouper
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1  egg white
1 teaspoon peanut oil
1 oz tree ears
1 large red bell pepper
2 oz snow peas
2 oz water chestnuts
1  in. peeled ginger root
1  scallion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 tablespoon vinegar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon sherry
2 cup peanut oil, for frying

Slice the fish into pieces 1/3 in. thick and 2 in. square. Combine
the fish with the corn- starch, egg white, and 1 tsp. peanut oil, and
let stand for 20 minutes. Cover the tree ears with warm water and let
stand for 20 minutes. Core and seed the red pepper and cut it into 1
in. squares. Snap the snow peas. Rinse the water chestnuts. Cut the
ginger into thin sli- vers, the scallion, into thin slices, and fine-
ly chop the garlic. Combine the ingredients for the sauce. Heat the
oil in a wok or frying pan- it should be very hot before adding the
fish. Add the fish, piece by piece, and cook for 1 minute. Transfer
the fish with a slotted spoon to a strainer over a bowl to catch the
oil. Discard all but 1/4 cup oil from wok and heat it again. Add the
ginger, scallion, and garlic, and stir-fry over high heat for 10
seconds. Add the pepper, water chestnuts, and pea pods, and stir-fry
for 1 minute. Add the tree ear and fish. Thoroughly mix the sauce and
add it to the wok. Cook the fish, stirring gently, for 1 minute, or
until the sauce thickens. This recipe calls for a slippery black
fungus called tree ears in North America, cloud ears in China, and
jelly mushrooms in Thailand. Tree ears have very little flavor and
are chiefly prized for their slippery, crisp consistency. Available
dried at Oriental markets, tree ears will keep indefinately. They
need only be soak- ed in warm water for 20 minutes before using.

Tangy Salmon Mousse

fish

418 gm canned pink alaska salmon
15 gm gelatine
50 gm smoked salmon - finely chopped
1 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh root ginger
150 ml greek strained yogurt
175 gm curd cheese or quark
2  egg whites
2 large grapefruits
1 tablespoon walnut oil
2 tablespoon grapefruit juice
1  mixed colored salad leaves
1  avocado for garnish

Drain the can of salmon. Heat the juice to almost boiling then
sprinkle over the gelatine. Stir gently until completely dissolved.

Mash the two types of salmon into a bowl and beat in the yogurt,
cheese and 1 teaspoon of the ginger. Stir in the dissolved gelatine
and cool until the mixture is just beginning to set. Whisk the egg
whites until they form stiff peaks. Fold these into the salmon
mixture then pour into a single 900ml / 1 1/2 pint fish mold or two
450ml / 3/4 pint moulds. Put into a refrigerator and leave until
completely set.

Peel the grapefruits and remove the pith from around each segment.
Put the segments into a bowl along with the remaining ginger, walnut
oil and grapefruit juice. Mix well and allow to stand for about 1
hour to marinade. Arrange the salad leaves and avocado on serving
plates and very carefully turn the mousse out onto them. Just before
serving, arrange the marinaded grapefruit segments onto the salad and
sprinkle the juices over.

Cook's Note: To turn out the mousses more easily, first dip the
moulds into hot water to loosen the sides then invert them onto the
serving plates. Pick up the plates and very gently shake from side to
side. The mousses should drop out.

Tempura Ahi Roll

fish, main dish

1/2 lb fresh ahi tuna or other
1  sushi style fish
2 each nori paper
1 each cucumber sliced lengthwise
1 each carrot sliced lengthwise
1  toasted sesame seeds
1  oil for deep frying
1 cup flour
1 cup club soda
1 each egg yolk

Slice ahi to 1/4 inch thick rectangle 4 to 6 inches on either side.
Roll two slices each of the carrot and cucumber inside the tuna. Roll
the tuna inside a sheet of the seaweed paper and seal sheet with a
dab of water. Prepare the deep fryer by heating the oil to 350 to
370    F.

Prepare the tempura batter by mixing the flour, egg yolk and club
soda. The amount of flour and soda should be modified to give the
tempura the right consistency.  The batter should be thick enough to
coat, but runny enough to spread easily.

When oil is ready, coat the roll in batter and deep fry for no more
than three minutes when the batter becomes a light golden color. Left
over carrots and cucumber or other vegitables (mushrooms come out
great) can be tempura fried as well.  Remove from oil and drain on a
paper towel.

Trim off ends to make a flat surface for presentation.  Slice in half
diagonally, then slice each half into two pieces, one flat on both
sides and one with one diagonal and one flat side.  The ahi should be
only slightly cooked on the outter edge, but should remain mostly raw
throughout.  Stand roll on edge on plate and sprinkle with sesame
seeds. Can be served with ponzu, soy or soy-wasabi sauce.

Tender Broccoli Stems With Clams

chinese, seafood

2 lb broccoli
4 large cloves garlic
1 tablespoon fermented soy beans
1/4 cup canned baby clams (or crabmeat or s; hrimp)
1/2 cup stock
2 tablespoon peanut oil for first stir-frying
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1  cornstarch paste

Preparation:  Wash broccoli and cut off flowerets (save for another
dish). With small paring knife, carefully peel outer skin off
broccoli stems, beginning at the base.  Leave inner stems whole.  Cut
stems on the bias into 1/4" slices.

Rinse fermented soy beans.  Peel garlic.  Mince together soy beans and
garlic; then mash to a paste using mortar and pestle; set aside. Place
drained baby clams in stock. If substituting fresh clams, crabmeat or
shrimp, wash, shell and chop into small pieces.

Stir-frying:  Heat wok to hot, then add first of oil. When oil just
begin to smoke, add broccoli and toss quickly to avoid burning.
Stir-fry for about 1 minute. Turn heat down to moderate (or on
electric range, remove from heat).  Push broccoli up side of wok; add
remaining oil to bottom of wok; add soy bean mixture. Press and stir
until odor of beans and garlic is present.

Return to high heat and immediately recombine with broccoli, stirring
constantly for about 30 seconds. Beans and garlic will burn easily,
so keep mixture moving. Quickly add clams and stock; stir-fry for
another 30 seconds.  Cover for 30 seconds to finish cooking broccoli.
Remove cover; thicken with cornstarch paste to light sauce.

Teno Salmon

fish, lapp

3/4 lb salmon, per person
1  water, butter, salt

Cross cut 1-inch slices from the salmon.  I prefer slices about the
size of my palm but also smaller ones will do. Use toothpicks to bind
them into round cutlets.

Pour about 1/4 inch water into a frying pan and bring it to a boil.
Add cutlets and simmer until the water has evaporated. Turn cutlets
once during cooking.

Add butter, fry lightly on both sides.  Add salt to taste and remove
toothpicks.

Serve with boiled or mashed potatoes and sliced lemon. (Lemon is not
traditional, but...)

NOTES:

*  Traditional salmon dish from Lappland -- This is the traditional
way to prepare salmon on the river Teno (the northern border river
between Norway and Finland).

: Difficulty:  very easy.
: Time:  5 minutes to prepare, 20 minutes to cook.
: Precision:  don't let water cover the cutlets.

Texiana Shrimp & Rice

seafood, tex mex

1 1/2 lb large shrimp
3 tablespoon oil; preferably canola or corn
2 medium onions; chopped
2  garlic cloves; minced
1 large green bell pepper; chopped
1/4 cup roasted green chile; preferably poblano or new
1 teaspoon cumin seeds; toasted and ground
1 teaspoon dried oregano; preferably mexican
1 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon ; salt
1  bay leaf
1 1/2 cup rice; uncooked
3 cup shrimp or seafood stock
2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
6  green onions; sliced
1/2 cup cilantro; chopped

Peel, and, if you wish, devein the shrimp.  Save the shells for stock.
Refrigerate the shrimp until you are ready to use them.

Warm the oil in a heavy skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add
the onions, garlic, green pepper, and green chile, and saute them,
stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened, about 5
minutes. Add the dried seasonings and the rice, stirring to coat all
the grains, and cook another couple of minutes. Add the stock and the
lemon juice, and bring the liquid to a boil.  Cover the skillet,
reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer 18 minutes. Check the
mixture toward the end of the cooking time, and stir if the rice
appears to be sticking.  Add the shrimp and the sliced green onions,
stirring to incorporate them. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more.

Remove the skillet from the heat, and let the shrimp and rice sit,
covered, for 10 minutes.  Then sprinkle the cilantro over the dish,
and serve it immediately. Eat any leftovers the next day. Source:

1/4 teaspoon black pepper-corns
2  garlic cloves, peeled
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 pinch salt
2 teaspoon thai fish sauce (nam pla)
1 tablespoon coarsely chopped coriander leaves
1/4 lb ground chicken, or moderately fatty; ground pork
1 lb jumbo prawns (16 to 20 per pound) w; ith the shell
1  vegetable oil for barbecuing
      ----SWEET AND SOUR CUCUMBER SALA---
4 tablespoon white vinegar
4 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon water
1/2  cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced
1 teaspoon dried shrimp powder with chili (opt; ional)
1/2 tablespoon fish sauce (nam pla)
2 teaspoon fresh coriander leaves, minced

* (if not available, use the stems)

Here's my first attempt at scanning recipes using my new OCR stuff.
Not bad.  It just took me about three times as long to diddle with
the scanned image as it would have to type it in... Ah well, practice
makes perfect. ;-}

In Thai cooking, a pounded paste fresh coriander roots, black pepper
corns and garlic makes a popular and useful spice mixture. This Thai
trio-spice paste is used in the same way as Italian pesto to season
stuffings, smear over meats as a marinade, or saute in oil to flavor
stir-fried dishes. In this recipe, it serves to flavor the stuffing.

Soak the bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.

Keep the coriander bunch tied together and rinse it in a pan of cold
water by dunking it up and down to dislodge the sand. Drain
thoroughly and spin dry in a lettuce drier. Cut off the roots,
including about 1 inch of the stem above the root; chop coarsely and
set aside.

To make the spice paste, pound the pepper corns in a mortar, or grind
in a spice mill Add the garlic, coriander roots, sugar and salt;
pound or grind into a smooth paste.

Combine the spice paste, fish sauce, coriander leaves and chicken.

Mix well.

To devein and butterfly the prawns, make a 1/2 inch deep cut through
the shell along the back with kitchen scissors.Pull out the black
vein (the alimentary canal). Rinse prawns under cold running water
and dry thoroughly.

Starting from the tail end, thread the prawns lengthwise onto the
skewers, ending at the head end. Spread open the 1/2-inch deep cut
and stuff with about a teaspoonful of chicken paste; smooth the
surface.

Repeat with remaining prawns.

Lightly brush prawns with oil.  Grill over a medium-hot fire for 1 to
2 minutes on each side, or until they turn bright orange and feel
firm to the touch.  They may also be broiled.  Serve with Sweet-Sour
Cucumber Salad.

SWEET AND SOUR CUCUMBER SALAD:

Combine the vinegar, sugar , salt and water in a small bowl; stir
until sugar and salt dissolve.  Put the cucumber slices in a shallow
bowl, sprinkle with shrimp powder and fish sauce, then pour in the
sweet vinegar to cover.  Top with coriander leaves.

Makes 8 servings.

Thai Chuu-Chii (Red Curry) Of Coffin Bay Scal

seafood, thai

1  stephen ceideburg
10  white peppercorns
1  mace
1 teaspoon thai shrimp paste
3  to 5 long red dried chillies
4  cloves shallots
1/2  stalk lemon grass
1 teaspoon galangal
1/2 teaspoon kaffir lime zest
1 tablespoon chopped coriander root
1/2 teaspoon salt
250 ml coconut cream
2 tablespoon to 3 tb red curry paste
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1/2 tablespoon palm sugar
24  coffin bay scallops
125 ml coconut milk
5  kaffir lime leaves
1 large fresh red chilli, julienned
2 tablespoon coriander leaves
1  jasmine rice

A colleague who recently visited the Darley Street Thai at its new
location in Bayswater Road, Kings Cross, described this dish as
"exquisite". Though the recipe may seem dauntingly lengthy, most of
it is simply a long list of ingredients for red curry paste, which
can be made in quantity and stored in a container in the fridge for
3-4 weeks for further use. Frozen kaffir limes can be bought very
cheaply in good Asian stores, where the rest of the ingredients
listed should also be avail- able. Grate the limes for zest while
they are stir frozen.

In a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind to a powder 10 white
peppercorns and a few sheaves of mace. Roast 1 teaspoon of Thai shrimp
paste by zapping it in a microwave oven or putting it on a little
piece of foil under the grill.

Put the pepper-mace mixture and the shrimp paste in a blender (David
recommends a blender but some of us will have to make do with a food
processor or the mortar and pestle) and add 3- 5 long red dried
chillies, deseeded, washed and chopped, 4 cloves of true shallots,
(or substitute the same quantity of Spanish onion), 1/2 stalk of
lemon grass, sliced, 1 teaspoon galangal. peeled and chopped, 1/2
teaspoon kaffir lime zest, 1 tablespoon of coriander root, scraped
and chopped, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a little water. Process to a
very fine paste. This may take up to 10 minutes. Transfer to a
storage jar.

In a medium-size pan, boil 250 mL coconut cream over high heat,
stirring constantly, until the oil separates out, about 3-5 minutes.
(If using canned coconut cream, don't shake the can -use the solid
mass of coconut at the top of the can, plus as much of the rest as
you need to make up 250mL. If it doesn't separate within 5 minutes,
add a tablespoon of oil.) Add 2-3 tablespoons of red curry paste and
fry for 5 minutes, stirring, until fra- grant. Add 1 tablespoon fish
sauce, 1/2 tablespoon palm sugar and fry until colour deepens. Add 24
Coffin Bay scallops (12 if other dishes will be served
simultaneously) and 125 mL coconut milk. Check for sweet-sour
balance. Throw in 5 kaffir lime leaves, shredded, 1 large fresh red
chilli, julienned, and 2 tablespoons of either coriander or basil
leaves. Serve with jasmine rice.

Thai Garlic Prawns

seafood, thai

1  stephen ceideburg
8  cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoon minced corriander root
2 tablespoon fish sauce
1 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 1/4 lb cleaned prawns
1  oil for frying

Spanish garlic prawns are yesterday's fashion, but are still so
enjoyable that most of us are prepared to eat them and to hell with
friends and colleagues next day. Perhaps the vast quantity of
coriander root in this Thai version has magical properties because
the after-math doesn't seem to be severe.

Prepare a marinade by mixing together 8 crushed cloves of garlic, 2
tablespoons washed and minced coriander root, 2 table- spoons fish
sauce, 1.5 tablespoons brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add 500 g
of shelled and cleaned prawns and leave to marinate for 15-30 minutes.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan, add the prawns and their
marinade and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes or just until the prawns are
pink. Stir in the juice of a lemon and serve immediately with rice
and sliced tomatoes and cucumber.

Thai Noodles With Seafood

seafood, thai

1  text only

This recipe is very simple,very fast and very good. The fresh rice
noodles, thick and white, can be found in the refrigerator cabinet of
any good Asian grocery store. Don't use frozen marinara mix++the
recipe deserves better. Any decent fishmonger will be happy to serve
you with half a dozen prawns, a few scallops, some squid, a small
fillet of fish, a handful of mussels or any other combination that
appeals to you.

Cut 500 g of mixed seafood into bite-size pieces, first removing any
shells.  If you are using mussels, wash and scrape the shells and
open them by putting them in a pot with a little boiling water. Cover
and boil for a few minutes, removing each mussel as it opens to
prevent overcooking.

Chop a handful of basil leaves and seed and finely slice 3 bird's eye
chillies.

In a frying pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Brown 2 tablespoons
of crushed garlic and saute the seafood for a couple of minutes.
Drain off the oil and set the garlic seafood mixture aside.

Put another tablespoon of oil in the pan and increase the heat. Add 2
tablespoons of light soya sauce and the noodles and saute for 2-3
minutes. Tip the seafood back into the pan and add 3 tablespoons of
fish sauce. Stir well.  Add the basil leaves and chillies and cook
for 1 minute more, stirring.  Serve,

Makes 3 to 4 servings.

Thai Seafood Casserole With Basil

cassarole, seafood, thai

4 oz dried bean thread noodles
1 small dungeness crab (preferably live)
1/2 lb large shrimp shelled and deveined
1/2 lb large cleaned squid cut crosswise i; nto 1 rings
1 lb fresh fish fillets  cut into 1-inch; pieces
1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
1 tablespoon chopped fresh coriander root
4  garlic cloves
1 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon golden mountain sauce =or=- dark so; y sauce
1 tablespoon light soy sauce =or=- thai fish sau; ce (nam pla)
2 teaspoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 slice ginger; (quarter-sized)  crushed
4  red chiles  chopped into 1/2-in pie; ces
4  green onions  cut into 2-in lengths
1 1/2 cup water, or more if needed
1/2 cup thai sweet basil leaves
1  fresh coriander sprigs
1  sandy clay pot casserole (2 quart s; ize) =or=- dutch oven

Golden Mountain Sauce is prepared with Thai style-soy sauce, which
may be found in Southeast Asian markets.

IN A BOWL, COVER MUNG BEAN noodles with warm water; soak until soft
and pliable, about 10 minutes. Drain. Set aside. Clean and prepare
the live crab according to the following instructions (if using
cooked crab, follow the instructions after the steaming step). Shell
and devein the shrimp; pat dry. Clean squid according to the
instructions below. Cut the body crosswise into 1-inch rings; set
aside the rings and cleaned tentacles. In a mortar or spice mill,
pound or grind the peppercorns, coriander root and garlic into a
paste. In a bowl, mix together the sugar, Golden Mountain Sauce, soy
sauce, oyster sauce, rice wine and sesame oil. Add oil to clay pot or
Dutch oven. Set over medium heat. Add reserved
coriander-garlic-pepper paste to the oil; saute lightly. Increase to
high heat. Add ginger, chiles and the crab pieces (add cooked crab
later); toss and brown for a minute. Add shrimp and green onions to
crab mixture; stir-fry for 30 seconds. Pour in the soy sauce mixture
and mung bean noodles; toss and mix together. Stir in water, cover
pot, reduce to medium heat and simmer for 8 minutes, stirring
occasionally. If noodles seem dry, add more water. Increase to
medium-high heat, add fish, squid and cooked crab, mix with the
noodles, top with the basil leaves. Cover. Cook 3 to 5 minutes
longer. Check for doneness. Bring the clay pot to the table and serve
hot with rice and vegetables.

TO CLEAN AND PREPARE THE CRAB: Scrub the underside and in between
claws and legs to loosen sand and grit. Rinse well with cold water.
Plunge crab into boiling water for a minute to kill it immediately.
Remove and cool. To disjoint and crack the crab, hold shell portion
of the crab in one hand. With the other hand, gather the legs and
claws on one side and gently pull and tug until the body and legs
loosen and free themselves as a whole section from the shell. On both
sides of the body are featherly gills. Pull off and discard these
gills. The tail piece, a triangular flap, is located on the underside
of the body. With tip of knife lift up the flap, grasp it, twist off
and discard. Scrub exposed area clean. Now remove the legs and claws
by gently pulling and bending them backward against their natural
bend, and twist to free them. You now have the chest-body section
where the tomalley liver is embedded in the cavity. Spoon it out and
reserve it for those who appreciate it. The chest body should be
chopped in half down the middle with a heavy cleaver. Chop each
section crosswise into 3 equal pieces. With a light hammer or metal
nut cracker, crack the mid section and joint of each leg and claw;
set aside the pieces. (When eating, use the tip of the leg as a pick
to dig out the meat.)

TO CLEAN AND PREPARE SQUID: Grasp the body of the squid with one hand
and with the other pull the head and tentacles away until separated
from the body. With your finger dip into the body to remove the
quill, the transparent cartilage and discard. Peel off the dotted
skin from the body and discard. Rinse body with cold water. Cut
between the eye and the tentacles; discard the head. Squeeze the
thick center part of the tentacles to dislodge the hard beak. Rinse
with cold water; set aside.

1/4 cup fresh lime juice
2 tablespoon fish sauce
2 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon chopped green onions
2 1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon grated peeled fresh ginger
2  garlic cloves, minced

Store the shrimp-pasta mixture and vinaigrette separately in the
refrigerator; toss just before serving. Fish sauce is a salty
condiment that accounts for the high sodium content of this salad. It
comes bottled and is sometimes labeled nam pla in Asian markets or
your supermarket's ethnic-food section.

1. Cook pasta in boiling water 9-1/2 minutes. Add carrot; cook an
additional 30 seconds. Drain, and cool. Combine pasta mixture, shrimp,
lettuce, cilantro leaves, and peanuts in a large bowl; toss well.

2. Combine lime juice and remaining ingredients in a jar. Cover
tightly, and shake vigorously. Pour over pasta mixture, tossing
gently to coat. Yield: 2 servings (serving size: 2 cups).

The Tama'ara'a (Tahitian)

seafood, tahiti

1  text only

The tama'ara'a comes of course after the ahima'a.  It is the meal at
which one eats what has been cooked in the ahima'a, together with the
traditional raw fish, raw and cooked freshwater shrimps, raw and
cooked crayfish, the mao'a [turbot] and the pahua taioro [clam
marinated in juice of grated coconuts, seawater and shrimps], the
mao'a or pahua with re'a [ginger], the miti [salt] hue [calabash],
the miti ha'ari [coconut or coconut milk], the popoi [manioca or
breadfruit paste], and of course the famous fafaru [fish marinated in
seawater], the smell of which is always a little shocking to an
outsider.  The usual drinks are beer, punch, red wine and water. Both
for the preparations of the ahima'a and for serving the tama'ara'a,
the Tahitians use traditional bowls, the 'umete made of wood. Some are
beautifully decorated and are used to prepare the po'e [starch and
stewed fruit preserve], the marinated raw fish, etc...

Other kitchen utensils are; the penu or pestle, made in stone or
coral; the hue or calabash, used to keep the mite hue or fafaru; the
'ana or coconut scraper++though nowadays metal-pointed scrapers have
replaced the traditional coral instrument, now only found in
old-fashioned households.

The tama'ara'a is not just a meal.  It has all the characteristics of
a feast in the country and no effort is spared to make the table and
the surroundings as colorful as possible, with plants, fruits and
flowers.

Each guest is received with great attention and is crowned with
flowers; the tiare tahiti, the tipanie, the fara [pandanus]. On the
ground or on a table covered with banana leaves (green ni'au [coconut
palms]) the crockery is laid out; 'umete, hue, bamboo cups, green
coconuts and split emptied coconut shells. Tradition demands that the
ma'a [food] tahiti be eaten with the fingers and therefore no cutlery
is laid out.

A tama'ara'a is always a happy occasion.  The family meets, friends
come together, and everyone is gay. There is music of course, because
in Polynesia a meal starts and ends with singing. A small orchestra is
improvised (all Tahitians are amateur musicians) with guitars,
ukelele and bass.  (This bass is a unique instrument; it is built
with a 20 litre oil-drum, a broomstick an a string tying one to the
other, and the sounds are obtained by plucking the string.) Punch,
beer and red wine contribute to the gaiety.

For each portion, fold a 12-inch square of baking parchment in half
diagonally and crease the corners.

Arrange one portion of tilapia filet on one side of the paper.

Season with a little lemon juice and top with a quarter of the shrimp
and asparagus.

Dot with a quarter of the lemon butter.

Fold the other side of the paper over the fish and seal the package
into a half oval with a series of creases, starting with one corner
and finishing with a twist at the opposite end.

Repeat for the remaining portions.

Bake the packages on a sheet pan until the paper is browned and
puffy, 7 to 8 minutes.

To serve, slit open each package and slide the contents, out onto a
plate; or serve in the paper, letting each diner cut open his own.

Toasted Dried Sea Laver - Keem Kui *

condiments, korean, seafood

6  sheets dried compressed  sea laver
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon salt

Tissue-thin sheets of dried and compressed sea laver (keem) are
toasted lightly until they turn bright green, then cut into small
pieces to serve as a side dish with main courses, rice or vegetables.

Throughout the waters surrounding Korea, Japan and Northern China,
this type of laver is harvested and processed to be put to many uses
in cooking; as a garnish, a vegetable, an edible food wrapper or as
part of a mixed condiment.

Brush the sea laver sheets on one side with the sesame oil, then
sprinkle lightly with salt.

Suspend over a gas flame or place under a hot broiler for about 8
seconds, until the laver turns bright green; do not let it burn or
catch fire.

Cool slightly, then cut into small squares and arrange on a serving
plate.

3  garlic cloves; chopped fine
2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice roasted
2 teaspoon salt
2 cup coriander; coarsly chopped
      ----SOUP----
6  chicken drumsticks; skinned
1 teaspoon chopped garlic and sliced
6 cup good chicken stock kaffir lime leav; es -
3/4 cup chopped onions or shallots -
3  slices fresh or frozen
2  stems lemon grass
2 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon lime juice
3  red chillies; seeded
1 tablespoon pepper and coriander paste
2  fresh, frozen, or dried
1  galangal, sliced
2 tablespoon fish sauce (nam pla)
1  chopped fresh coriander

(Thai Chicken in Lemon Grass Soup) This is from Charmaine Solomon's
newest publication: THAI COOKBOOK.

TO MAKE PEPPER AND CORIANDER PASTE: This is a basic Thai flavoring
and will make about one cup which you can store in your fridge. You
will use about one teaspoon of it in the Tom Yum Gai. In a dry
skillet, dry roast about one Tbs whole black peppercorns for a minute
or two.

In your blender whizz up the peppercorns together with 2 or 3 garlic
cloves, 2 tsp salt, 2 Tbs lemon juice, and a big bunch of fresh
coriander (cilantro) which you have coarsely chopped, stems and roots
included (about 2 cups).

TO MAKE THE SOUP: Whack each drumstick in two. Whizz up the garlic,
chillies, and Pepper and Coriander Paste together in your blender,
and mix with the chicken. Allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Place the
stock, lime leaves (or zest), onions, galangal, lemon grass, and
sugar in a large saucepan together with the chicken and simmer about
30 minutes or until chicken is tender. Add fish sauce and lime juice.
Adjust flavorings for spicy and sour to your taste. Serve garnished
with coriander and sliced chillies.

NOTES: Be aware that the fresh chillies used for this recipe are very
acidic. Thorougly wash your hands after handling. DO NOT rub your eyes
until you have washed your hands. Submitted By CHIAPET1@IX.NETCOM.COM

Torsk Med Eggesaus (Poached Codfish Steaks W/

cheese/eggs, main dish, norwegian, seafood

1/2 cup salt
6  codfish steaks; fresh, sliced 3/4 thick
      ----EGG SAUCE----
1/4 lb butter
1/4 cup hot fish stock (from above)
1 medium tomato; peeled, seeded and choppe
1 tablespoon chives; finely chopped
1  salt & pepper
      ----ALTERNATE GARNISH----
8 tablespoon butter; melted
1  lemon; thinly sliced
1  parsley sprigs

If you don't have a long, narrow fish poacher, an enamel roasting pan
5" deep will do just as well. Fill the pan with water to a depth of
4" and add 1/2 cup salt. Bring to a boil (over two burners, if
necessary), reduce heat slightly and gently slide the cod slices into
the water with a spatula. Lower the heat until water is bubbling
slightly and simmer for about 5 minutes. Be careful not to overcook
or the fish will disintegrate. Remove the slices with a slotted
spatula and drain them on a linen napkin or dish towel. Reserve stock
for use in the egg sauce. Arrange cod attractively on a heated
platter and serve with egg sauce. EGG SAUCE: Melt the butter in a
saucepan. Remove from the heat, beat in 1/4 cup of the stock in which
you poached the fish and stir in chopped egg, tomato, parsley and
chives. Add salt and pepper to taste. Heat almost to the boiling
point, pour into a sauceboat and serve with the cod. If you prefer,
you can simply pour melted butter over the cod and garnish with lemon
slices and parsley. In Norway, this dish is often accompanied by raw
diced carrots, sprinkled with lemon juice and new potatoes (see
recipe).

Trilobite Creole

cambrian, critters, seafood

2 lb fresh trilobites*
1 quart water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 medium yellow onions; chopped
2 large bell peppers (red, green or yellow); chopped
5  ribs celery; chopped fine
10 large tomatoes; peeled, seeded
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon red pepper; ground
1/2 teaspoon black pepper; ground
1/2 teaspoon white pepper; ground
2 teaspoon dried thyme
2 teaspoon dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
5 each bay leaf
1 cup green onions; chopped
1 cup parsley; chopped
1 teaspoon tabasco sauce; or more to taste

*If trilobites are out of season or extinct in your area, shrimp or
crawfish may be substitued.

Peel and devein the trilobites. Place heads (if you still have them),
and peels in a small saucepan and add water. Bring to a slow boil over
medium-high heat and boil slowly for 15-20 minutes. Strain and
discard the heads and peels. Retain the stock.

Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place over
medium-high heat. Add the onions, peppers and celery and saute,
stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes.
Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar and shrimp stock

hours, stirring occasionally. This is your creole sauce and it can be
prepared 1-2 days in advance and stored in the 'fridge. The flavors
improve after sitting a couple of days.

When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and add the
trilobites. Cook until they turn pink, about 7 minutes. Stir in the
green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more. Serve on
rice.

2  carrots
1  juice of 1/2 lemon
2 small onions

Trout Sauteed In Butter

seafood

1  salt and pepper
4  fresh trout, dressed
1  a few tbsp. flour
6 tablespoon unsalted butter
1  parsley sprigs
1  lemon wedges

As every angler knows, skillet-size brook, brown, and rainbow trout
are never more tasty than when prepared this way. Can there be any
tastier dish than the one that comes from this happy marriage of
fresh trout and butter? But for best results, a few words of warning:
a basic rule of fish cookery is that fish, unless deep fried, should
be cooked slowly. Yet, at the same time, one wants the flesh moist
but with the outside golden brown. Furthermore one wants to be able
to serve trout whole, not in broken chunks, the result of sticking.
One other word: since trout are delicately flavored, I do not "flour"
trout with cornmeal but with flour. However, either way, the trout
will be delicious. Salt, pepper and coat the trout by rolling them in
the flour.
Melt the butter in a big iron skillet.
When the butter is hot (over medium heat) but has not yet shown
color, lay in the trout and turn the fire low. A steady, low heat
will do two things: cook the trout slowly and at the same time brown
the trout.
You must police the process continuously, and it will take 15-20
minutes, depending on the size of the trout.
Just as soon as the flour coating has set on the down side, loosen
each trout from the skillet, shaking the skillet gently to keep the
slow browning trout free.
After 10 minutes of slow browning, turn each trout carefully and
repeat the above process.
When you serve the trout, pour a bit of the butter over each and
garnish with a sprig of parsley and a wedge of lemon. SAUTEED QUICK
MEUNIERE ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

If you wish, add a couple of pats of butter to the skillet after
the trout has been served, melt them, squeeze in a tablespoon of
lemon juice, turn up the heat, and stir. Then pour this lemon-butter
sauce over each trout.

enough oil to film generously the bottom of the skillet. Add the
fish, season with salt and pepper, and cook over medium heat until
pale gold on both sides, turning once.  Remove the fish to a warm
dish. Pour the vinegar into the pan, stirring to melt any browned
bits, add the toasted nuts and spoon evenly over the fish.

Strain the liquor the trout were simmered in, add to it the tomato
sauce, and over fire stir in the gelatin. Stir over low heat just
until the gelatin melts. Set gelatin liquid in refrigerator until it
cools but is not as yet "set."
Arrange trout in a flat dish, pour over them the aspic, and allow
to set.
Arrange parsley and then lemon slices around the trout and serve.

slices of bacon around each trout, tucking the ends under the trout.
Bake in a large baking dish so trout are not touching in preheated
500 degree oven about 15 minutes, until skin is crisp and the fish is
opaque to the bone.  Test after 12 minutes. Vegetables will remain
crisp.

Trout With Garlic & Rosemary

fish, seasonings

4  trout, pan dressed
2 teaspoon olive oil
4 medium garlic cloves; pressed
4  sprigs fresh rosemary
1  lemon; quartered

A simple approach that doesn't complicate the delicate flavors of
trout, this recipe yields a delicious and attractive entree with a
minimum of preparation.

Rinse the trout inside and out; pat dry with paper towel. Using your
fingers, rub olive oil over the inside and outside surface of each
fish. Next, gently rub one clove of crushed garlic inside the body
cavity of each trout, distributing the garlic throughout. Place one
sprig of rosemary inside each fish.  Place fish over medium-hot fire
and grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve with lemon wedges.

Trout With Herb Butter Sauce

fish, main dish

1 small carrot
1 small rib celery
1/2  yellow onion
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 large sprig fresh parsley
3 cup water
1/2 cup white wine
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
      ----HERB BUTTER SAUCE----
2 tablespoon minced fresh chives
2 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon tarragon
1/4 cup court bouillon
1/4 cup white wine
1 teaspoon white-wine vinegar
6 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1  salt and pepper
4  trout fillets, unskinned
      ----COURT BOUILLON----
1  -or- salmon-trout fillets

Court Bouillon:  Peel the carrot and cut into thin slices. Cut celery
and onion into thin slices.  In a non-reactive pot, combine all of the
ingredients; bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. You
should have about 3 cups.  Court Bouillon can be made several days
ahead, or it can be frozen.

COOKING AND SERVING: Bring Court Bouillon to a simmer. Put the
fillets, skin side down, into the simmering liquid, lower heat, and
poach gently until fish is just cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Remove fish from the liquid, peel off the skin, and cover to keep
warm. Strain the Court Bouillon and put 1/4 cup into a small
saucepan. Reserve remaining bouillon for another use. Add wine and
vinegar to the saucepan and bring to a boil; boil about 3 minutes
until liquid is reduced to 2 tbs. Over the lowest possible heat,
whisk in the butter a bit at a time. The butter should soften to make
a creamy sauce but should not melt completely. Stir in the chives,
parsley, tarragon, and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Serve the fish topped with the sauce.

Yield: 4 servings.

NOTE:  The Herb Butter Sauce here is a variation of the traditional
French beurre blanc.  The sauce is rich and powerful, yet also subtle
enough so that it won't overpower the delicate taste of the poached
fish. The trick to making this sauce is to emulsify the butter
without melting it, so that the sauce is creamy. The acid in the wine
and vinegar aid in the emulsification.  Whisk in the butter, a tbs at
a time, over the lowest possible heat, moving on and off the heat as
necessary.

Truchas A La Navarra (Trout With Red Wine And

fish, spanish

1/2 cup dry red wine
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup onions; finely chopped
1 tablespoon mint, fresh; finely cut
1/2 teaspoon rosemary, dried
1/2 teaspoon thyme, dried
1 small bay leaf; crumbled
15  whole black peppercorns use up to 2; 0
1 teaspoon salt
4  trout; *
3  egg yolks; lightly beaten

* 8 to 12 ounces each, cleaned but with heads and tails left on

In a flameproof glass, enamel or stainless-steel baking dish large
enough to hold the fish in one layer, combine the red wine, olive
oil, water, onions, mint, rosemary, thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns and
salt, and stir thoroughly. Wash trout under cold running water and
dry them completely with paper towels. Then place them in the
marinade, turning them about to coat them thoroughly. Marinate at
room temperature for about 30 minutes, turning the trout over after
15    minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On top of the stove bring the
marinade to a simmer, then lay a sheet of wax paper or foil lightly
over the baking dish. Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes,
or until the fish is firm to the touch. Be careful not to overcook.

With a slotted spatula, transfer the fish to a heated serving platter
and cover loosely with foil to keep them warm. Strain the cooking
liquid through a fine sieve into a small saucepan, pressing down hard
on the onions and herbs with the back of a spoon before discarding
them. Whisk about 1/4 cup of the liquid into the beaten egg yolks,
then whisk the mixture into the remaining liquid in the pan. Heat
slowly, whisking constantly, until the sauce thickens lightly. (Do
not let it come anywhere near a boil or it will curdle.) Taste for
seasoning.

Pour the sauce over the trout or serve the sauce separately.
Traditionally the trout are accompanied by hot, freshly boiled
potatoes.

Truite Au Bleu (Blue Trout)

seafood

2 tablespoon butter
1  shallot of scallion, minced
1  rib celery w/leaves/chopped
1  carrot, thinly sliced
1  dressed trout, head and all
1  but cut into chunks
1 tablespoon salt
6  peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon thyme
2 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1  bay leaf
3 cup water
1 cup white wine or dry vermouth
3 tablespoon tarragon vinegar
5  whole 10 trout

This dish is basically trout poached in a vegetable court bouillon
flavored with a cut-up trout.  It is a lovely way to offer the
delicacy of trout, and can be either a fish course, if the trout are
6-8 inchers, or a main course if the trout  are 10-11 inchers. As a
fish course for a game dinner serve    the trout cold ( in an aspic
if you wish-see below).

In a big saucepan or deep skillet with lid melt the butter and saute'
the vegetables until the shallot is just soft.
Add the single cut-up trout and the remaining ingredients (except
whole trout), bring to a bubble, and simmer for ten minutes or so.
Add the dressed whole trout, cover, and simmer slowly for about
20-minutes.
If the dish is a main course, remove the fish, drain, and serve
immediately with melted butter and lemon juice or herb butter.
If the dish is just a fish course, allow the fish to cool in the
liquor and serve the drained trout with a slice of lemon.

contours of the fruit, use a small paring knife to cut away the
skin
and bitter white pith.  Cut crosswise into 6 slices 1/4 inch
thick;
set aside. 3. Season the trout, inside and out, with salt and
pepper. Dip the
trout in flour to coat completely and shake off the excess. Heat 3
tablespoons of the butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a large
frying
pan over medium heat.  Add 3 trout and cook until golden brown on
one side, 5-8 minutes.  Turn and continue cooking until golden
brown
and tender when the flesh is pierced with the point of a knife,
5-8 minutes longer.  Transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm.
Repeat to cook the 3 remaining trout. 4. Discard the butter and
oil in the pan.  Heat the remaining 10
tablespoons butter in the same pan over medium heat. Add the
almonds
and saute until golden brown.  Pour over fish. Place 1 slice of
lemon on each trout.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley. ~--

Truites Au Bleu (Trout Cooked In Court Bouill

fish

4  10-oz. trout
4 quart water
1 cup white vinegar
1  bay leaf
1  salt to taste
10  peppercorns
1  lemon wedges
1  melted butter or
1  hollandaise sauce

Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut off the fins from the back and
sides of the trout.  Leave the head and tail intact.
Using a long needle such as a trussing needle, run a string through
the eyes of the trout, then the tail. Tie the head and tail together.
This is simply for appearance. When trout are freshly caught, they
are killed and dressed and dropped into boiling water immediately.
These trout will curve naturally through muscle and nerve reaction.
Combine the water and vinegar in a fairly wide casserole. There
should be enough liquid to cover the trout when they are added. Add
the bay leaf, salt and peppercorns. Bring to the boil and simmer for
10 minutes.
Drop the trout into simmering water.  Simmer for 5 minutes. Drain the
trout and serve with lemon wedges and hot melted butter or Hollandaise
Sauce. The New New York Times Cookbook, by Craig Claiborne with Pierre
Franey, Times Books, NY, 1975.

Tulip~ Crab~ & Asparagus Appetizers

appetizers, flowers, seafood

3 oz cream cheese; softened
2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon minced chives
1 teaspoon minced fresh dill or mint (optional; )
1 dash pepper or cayenne
1 cup crab meat, flaked
25  fresh asparagus spears
25  tulip petals

In a medium bowl, beat cheese with lemon juice, herbs, and pepper;
stir in crab. Break tough ends off asparagus. Blanch in 1 inch of
boiling water in a large skillet with a lid, or steam standing
upright in a couple of inches of water in a tall, narrow pot, until
crisp-tender, 2 to 5 minutes, depending on thickness of stems.
Plunge into an ice-water bath for 1 minute; then pat dry.  Trim
asparagus to abut 5 inches; from the trimmings, cut as many 1/4-inch
rounds as you have tulip petals. Save extra ends for salads. Fill
each tulip petal with about 1/2 a rounded teaspoon of crab mixture
and garnish with an asparagus round. (If your petals are large and
asparagus thin, you can use 3 rounds to garnish each filled petal.)
Arrange asparagus in a fan on a serving platter and place tulip
petals alternately (or create your own pattern).

Tuna

canning, fish

1 x no ingredients

Tuna may be canned either precooked or raw. Preooking removes most of
the strong-flavored oils. The strong flavor of dark tuna flesh
affects the delicate flavor of white flesh. Many people prefer not to
can dark flesh. It may be used as pet food.

Note: Glass-like crystals of magnesium ammonium phosphate sometimes
form in canned tuna. There is no way for the home canner to prevent
these crystals from forming, but they usually dissolve when heated
and are safe to eat.

Procedure: Keep tuna on ice until ready to can. Remove viscera and
wash fish well in cold water. Allow blood to drain from stomach
cavity. Place fish belly down on a rack or metal tray in the bottom
of a large baking pan. Cut tuna in half crosswise, if necessary.
Precook fish by baking at 250 degrees F for 2-1/2 to 4 hours
(depending on size) or at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. The fish may also
be cooked in a steamer for 2 to 4 hours. If a thermometer is used,
cook to a 165 to 175 degree F internal temperature. Refrigerate
cooked fish overnight to firm the meat. Peel off the skin with a
knife, removing blood vessels and any discolored flesh. Cut meat away
from bones; cut out and discard all bones, fin bases, and dark flesh.
Quarter. Cut quarters crosswise into lengths suitable for half-pint
or pint jars. Fill into jars, pressing down gently to make a solid
pack. Tuna may be packed in water or oil, whichever is preferred. Add
water or oil to jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 1/2 teaspoon of
salt per half-pint or 1 teaspoon of salt per pint, if desired.

Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or
Table 2 according to the canning method used.

Table 1. Recommended process time for Tuna in a dial-gauge pressure
canner.

Jar Size: Pints and Half-pints. Process Time: 100 minutes. Canner
Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes of 0 - 2,000 ft: 11 lb.
2,001 - 4,000 ft: 12 lb.
4,001 - 6,000 ft: 13 lb.
6,001 - 8,000 ft: 14 lb.

Table 2. Recommended process time for Tuna in a weighted-gauge
pressure canner.

Jar Size: Pints and Half-pints. Process Time: 100 minutes. Canner
Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes of 0 - 1,000 ft: 10 lb.
Above 1,000 ft: 15 lb.

Tuna Sashimi

japanese, seafood

1  text only

Here's my favorite recipe for tuna.

1. Buy (or preferably, catch) fresh tuna.

2. slice and reserve.

3. Mix wasabi powder with soy sauce

4. Heat sake

5. Eat.

NOTE:  You may substitute any fresh, firm white or red fleshed fish,
up to and including chicken for the tuna.

Rice is nice with this dish, though that does bring the over-all prep
time up close to a half hour.  ;-}

Tuna Sashimi With Orange Glaze

fish, seafood

2  ripe plum tomatoes
2 cup fresh orange juice
2 tablespoon green peppercorns in water  drained
1/2 teaspoon salt; or as desired
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 lb fresh tuna; in 1/4-in-thick slices
2  oranges; peeled, in sections

CUT OFF TIP AND STEM of tomatoes; remove seeds and core. Slice
tomatoes into flat slices; lay each slice flat. Cut lengthwise into
1/4-inch strips, pile strips; cut horizontally in 1/4-inch pieces.
Reserve on a plate in refrigerator, covered. Chill 4 plates. In a
small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine juice, 1 tablespoon
green peppercorns and salt. Bring to boil and reduce until only 2/3
cup remains. The mixture should be thick and syrupy. Transfer liquid
to bowl and cool to room temperature. When cool, beat in oil to make
"glaze." If the mixture has a very shiny appearance and seems like
it's going to separate, add a few drops of water or orange juice. To
serve, spoon glaze onto plates. Arrange sliced fish on top. Garnish
with the orange sections, the remaining tablespoon of green
peppercorns and the chopped tomato.

3 tablespoon prepared wasabi (japanese horseradi; sh)
1  ground black pepper to taste

Tuna With Wasabi Lime Butter Sauce Saltimbocca *Jb

main dish, seafood

      ----FISH----
4  thick (1-inch) tuna steaks (each ab; out 1/2 pound)
1  vegetable oil for brushing tuna
1 1/2 teaspoon crushed black peppercorns
1 tablespoon minced fresh dill
      ----SAUCE----
3  scallions, sliced thin (1/3 cup)
1 teaspoon minced fresh coriander
1 1/2 tablespoon fresh lime juice
3 tablespoon soy sauce
1 1/2 tablespoon wasabi paste* (green horseradish pa; ste)
3/4  stick (6 tablespoons) cold unsalted; butter, cut into pieces

* Available at Japanese markets and some specialty food shops.

Prepare grill.

Arrange tuna steaks in one layer in a shallow dish and lightly brush
both sides with oil. Spread peppercorns and dill evenly on both sides
of tuna and marinate for 20 minutes.

Grill tuna on an oiled rack set about 5 to 6 inches over glowing
coals 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare fish. (Alternatively,
grill tuna in a preheated oiled well-seasoned ridged grill pan.)

Serve tuna with sauce.

Make sauce while tuna marinates: In a heavy saucepan combine
scallions, coriander, lime juice, soy sauce, and wasabi paste and
bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, 1 piece at a
time, lifting pan from heat occasionally to cool mixture and adding
each new piece before previous one has melted completely. (Do not
allow sauce to simmer. Sauce should not get hot enough to separate.)

Serves 4

Two Brines For Smoking Fish

seafood

      ----BRINE #1----
4 cup water
1/2 cup salt
1/2 cup sugar
1  plus your choice of
1  flavorings
      ----BRINE #2----
4 cup water
1 cup rock salt
2 cup brown sugar
1 cup salt, regular or curing
1  plus your choice of
1  flavorings

It is recommended that you rub in flavorings just before putting the
fish into the smoker, although you can also put flavorings into
either of the above brines; in other words you can prepare a brine
marinade flavored with garlic, shallots, tarragon, dill, thyme, or
whatever you fancy. After brining in the flavored brine, fish should
washed off and dried before smoking.

Smoked fish will keep for a solid year, at least if they are frozen in
airtight plastic bags from which the air has been exhaled.

Ukha (Clear Salmon Soup)

fish, russian, soups

6 cup ; water
1 1/2 lb smelts, whole; cleaned well
1  onion, med
1  carrot, large; peeled/quarte
1  leek (white only)
1  celery stalk; with leaves
1  parsnip; peeled
1  bouquet garni
1  salt; to taste
1  pepper, white; to taste
1 lb salmon trimmings
3/4 cup wine, white, dry
3  potato, new
2  carrot, thin; peeled
1  egg white
1  eggshell; crushed
1 lb salmon fillet, skinned
5 tablespoon scallion; chopped
1  lemon slices, thin

Approx. Cook Time: 2:00 In a
large stock pot, place the water, smelts, onion, quartered carrot,
leek, celery, parsnip, bouquet garni, and salt and pepper, and bring
to a boil over high heat, periodically skimming off the foam as it
rises to the top. Cover the pot, reduce the heat, and simmer for 35
minutes. Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a clean pot,
pressing the solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much
liquid as possible. Discard the solids. Return the stock to the heat
and add the salmon trimmings, wine, potatoes, and thin carrots. Bring
to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the
vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Strain the stock into a
clean pot, discarding all the solids except the potatoes and all the
carrots. Rinse the potatoes and carrots being careful not to mash
them, and set aside. Return the stock to low heat and simmer for
several minutes. Add the egg white and shell and increase the heat to
medium high. Bring to a boil, beating constantly, with a wire whisk.
When the stock boils, the egg white will start rising to the surface.
At this point, turn off the heat and let stand for five minutes. Line
a colander with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth and strain the
stock into a clean pot. Add the fish fillets to the stock and poach
over medium low heat until cooked through; five minutes. Taste and
adjust the seasonings. Halve the reserved potatoes and cut into
wedges.  Cut the carrots into fine dice. Divide the fish fillets
among six soup bowls. Add a few potato wedges and diced carrots to
each bowl.  Ladle the stock into the bowls, sprinkle with scallions,
and garnish with lemon slices.

Uunissa Paistettu Hauki (Baked Stuffed Pike)

main dish, seafood

3 quart boiling salted water
2/3 cup rice
1 large cucumber; peeled, seeded and coarse
1/4 teaspoon salt
2  hard-cooked eggs; coarsely chopped
2 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup onions; finely chopped
1/2 cup parsley; finely chopped
1/4 cup chives; finely chopped
1 tablespoon salt
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1 tablespoon heavy cream (to 3 tb)
8 tablespoon butter (a 1/4-lb stick)
6 tablespoon dry bread crumbs
3 lb pike; cleaned and scaled *
1/2 cup boiling water

* Remove backbone but leave head and tail on fish. May substitute
mackerel or sea bass. Cook the rice uncovered in 3 quarts
boiling, salted water for about 12 minutes or until it is still
slightly firm. Drain in a large colander and set aside to cool. In a
small bowl, toss the chopped cucumber with 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Let
it sit for at least 15 minutes, then drain and pat dry with paper
towels. In a small saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and cook
onions and cucumbers 6 to 8 minutes until soft and transparent but
not brown. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and add chopped eggs,
cooked rice, parsley and chives. Season with salt and pepper and
moisten with a tablespoon of heavy cream, adding more if the stuffing
seems too dry. Mix together lightly but thoroughly. Wash the fish
inside and out under cold running water and dry thoroughly. Fill the
fish with the cucumber-rice stuffing, close the opening with small
skewers and crisscross kitchen string around the skewers as you would
lace a turkey. Preheat oven to 350øF. In a baking dish or roasting
pan attractive enough to bring to the table and large enough to hold
the fish, melt 1/4 lb butter over moderate heat. When the foam
subsides, place the fish in the baking dish, raise the heat and cook
for about 5 minutes until it is golden brown. Carefully turn over the
fish and brown the other side. Sprinkle top with half of the bread
crumbs and then turn the fish over again and sprinkle the other side
with the remaining bread crumbs. Pour 1/2 cup boiling water around
the fish and bring it to a simmer on top of the stove. Bake uncovered

Varm Krabbsm”rg†s (Hot Crabmeat Canap‚s)

appetizers, seafood, swedish

1/2 lb crabmeat; fresh, frozen or canned,
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1 tablespoon fresh dill; chopped
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon flour
1  egg yolk
1 cup light cream
6 slice white bread; home-style

In a large mixing bowl, combine the crabmeat, sherry, salt, pepper
and dill and set aside. Melt the tablespoon of butter without
browning it in a small, heavy saucepan, remove from the heat and stir
in the flour. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolk with the cream and
briskly stir this mixture into the butter-flour roux with a wire
whisk. Return the pan to the heat and cook slowly, whisking
constantly for a minute or two until the mixture thickens; do not let
it boil. Pour the sauce over the crabmeat mixture in the bowl and
stir together with a spoon until the ingredients are well combined.
Taste for seasoning. Cut four rounds from each slice of bread, using
a small cookie cutter or glass. Toast the bread rounds on one side
only under a moderately hot broiler. Remove and spread the untoasted
side of each round generously with the crabmeat mixture, mounding it
slightly. These may be prepared in advance up to this point and then
refrigerated. Just before serving, place under a hot broiler for a
minute or so until the canap‚s brown slightly. Serve very hot.

Very Best Monkeyed-Up Lobster Dish

main dish, seafood

1 medium lobster; or 1/2 large
1  shallot, sliced
3  morels, halved; regular mushrooms will do
1  butter
1 oz wine, white
1 tablespoon bourbon; cognac will do
1 oz heavy cream; or more salt

Very best lobster dish: Steam 1 big lobster per person over sea
water. The really big ones (2+ lb.) aren't done as soon as they turn
red - let them cook a couple more minutes beyond that; little
lobsters are ready as soon as they turn red. Have an assistant remove
the claw meat (keep whole) and whatever knuckle meat and roe (s)he
can find while you take the tails and either (depending on their
size) halve them lengthwise or cut them through the shell into
slices. Heat a big knob of butter in a big saucepan and toss the tail
pieces in the hot butter for a minute. Remove the tails to a hot
platter. Dump the shallots and mushrooms in the same butter and toss
for a minute; then remove them to the same platter. While the butter
is still hot, add white wine and bourbon (Cognac will do); let cook
down for 15 secs or so and then add cream, slowly and keeping the
heat high. While your assistant arranges the tails on individual
plates, with the claws and maybe some watercress or parsley as
garnish, keep an eye on the sauce as it thickens. When the sauce is
thick, add a little salt if you need it and dump in the onions,
mushrooms, roe, and knuckle meat. Pour sauce over lobster tails and
serve at once. Save the tomalley for: Tomalley croustades. Fry rounds
from a baguette or other very thin loaf in butter until they just
begin to turn golden. Drain on paper towels. When they are cool,
spread them with lobster tomalley mixed with heavy cream to make a
thick paste. You may grate a tiny bit of Gruyere or other Swiss-style
cheese over each one. Put under the broiler for a few seconds until
the tops bubble.

Vietnamese Crab Spring Rolls

appetizers, seafood

2 oz dried bean thread noodles (mung bea; n)
3 tablespoon sm. dried tree-ear mushrooms
1 lb ground pork butt
4  garlic cloves  finely minced or pur; eed
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1/2 teaspoon fresh finely ground pepper
1 cup flaked crab meat
1 cup grated carrot
1 cup bean sprouts; tails removed
4  shallots; minced -=or=- onion
2 cup warm water
1/4 cup sugar
16  12 rice paper wrappers  (dried)
1  peanut oil for deep-frying
1  lettuce leaves
1  fresh mint
1  fresh coriander leaves

IN SEPARATE MEDIUM BOWLS, soak the mung bean noodles and tree-ear
mushrooms with water until soft and pliable. Drain the noodles and
cut into shorter lengths; set aside. Remove the hard centers from the
mushrooms, coarsely chop and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the
pork, garlic, fish sauce and ground pepper. Mix in crab meat,
tree-ear mushrooms, carrots, bean sprouts, shallots and bean thread
noodles; set aside. Combine the warm water and sugar in a bowl. Lay 1
rice paper wrapper on a damp towel. (Keep unused wrappers in their
package.) Generously brush it with the sugar water; allow it to
soften to a very pliable wrapper, about 30 seconds or sometime longer
(depending upon the brand). With your hands shape 3 tablespoons
filling into a tight compact 1-inch-wide-by-4-to-5-inch-long
cylinder. Place cylinder along the lower edge of wrapper. Roll the
bottom up and over the roll tightly. Fold both outside edges inward
to enclose the ends. Continue rolling up into a cylinder; set aside
covered with plastic wrap. Repeat until all the rolls are done. To
cook and brown evenly, the roll must be firm and evenly packed. If
the wrapper has a tear, bandage it with a softened rice-paper
remnant. In a preheated wok or saucepan, add oil to a depth of 2
inches and heat to 325F. Add a few rolls at a time, but do not crowd.
Fry for 10 seconds. Immediately increase to high heat or 375F. Fry,
turning occasionally until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove
and drain on paper towel. Cut crosswise into 1+1/2-inch pieces.
Arrange rolls on a plate lined with lettuce. On another plate,
arrange leaves of lettuce, fresh coriander and mint leaves. To eat,
wrap spring-roll garnish with sprig of coriander and mint leaves in a
lettuce leaf and dip into nuoc cham sauce (See RECIPE).

Walleyes In Red Wine Sauce

seafood

1  salt and fresh pepper
1 cup boiling water
4  walleyes, cleaned
2  bay leaves
2 tablespoon flour for dredging
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1  onion, minced
1 tablespoon tomate pureee
6 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoon capers
2  cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoon chopped parsley
1 cup red wine

Salt and pepper the fish and dredge in flour.  Shake off excess.
In a heavy saucepan saute the onion in 2 Tbs. olive oil. When
translucent, add the garlic and slowly saute another minute. Stir in 2
tablespoons flour, blend well, and cook, stirring for a minute or
two. Off heat pour in the wine and boiling water; whisk thoroughly.
Return to heat, whisking as the sauce thickens. Add bay leaves,
thyme, and tomato puree. Let simmer while you sear the fish.
In a pan large enough to hold the 4 walleyes in one layer, heat the
remaining oil and when hot, but nor smoking, sear the fish quickly on
each side.
Now, pour the red wine sauce over the fish.  Bring to a boil, then
quickly lower the heat.  Cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes.
Just before serving remove the bay leaves, adjust the seasoning (the
sauce will probably need salt and pepper), toss the capers in, and
sprinkle with chopped parsley on top.

1 cup jalapeno jack cheese --
1  grated
1 cup spinach leaves -- shredded
1  yellow tomato salsa---
1 lb yellow tomatoes
1 large shallot -- very finely
1  minced
1 large clove garlic -- very finely
1  minced
2 tablespoon fresh cilantro -- very
1  finely minced

1  salt -- to taste
1 tablespoon maple syrup (optional) -- if
1  not sweet enough
1  jicama salad (separate
1  recipe)

For the Lobster Filling:  Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Fill a large
stock pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil over high
heat. Add lobsters and cook for about 8 minutes or until just done.
Drain and let lobsters cool slightly. Wrap tortillas tightly in foil
and place in preheated 300 degree oven for about 15 minutes or until
heated through. Keep warm until ready to use. Remove meat from
lobster tails being careful not to tear it apart. Cut meat into thin
medallions (or medium-sized dice, if meat breaks apart). Heat oil in
a medium saute pan over medium heat and saute lobster medallions
until just heated through. Spoon equal portions of warm lobster
medallions into the center of each warm tortilla. Sprinkle with equal
portions of grated cheese and shredded spinach. Roll tortillas into a
cylinder shape and place each one on a warm serving plate with the
edge facing the bottom. Surround the taco with Yellow Tomato Salsa
and garnish each side with a small mound of Jicama Salad (separate
recipe).

For the Yellow Tomato Salsa:  In a food processor, using the steel
blade, process tomatoes until well chopped. Do not puree. Combine
tomatoes and their juices with shallot, garlic, cilantro, vinegar,
chilies, lime juice, and salt, mixing well. Add maple syrup, if
needed, to balance flavor and sweeten slightly. Cover and refrigerate
for at least 2 hours or until very cold. Note: For a crunchier, more
typical salsa, put tomatoes through fine die of a food grinder.

Chef's Notes:  "I created this dish in early 1986 and it quickly
became my signature appetizer on The Mansion on Turtle Creek menu.
The name 'Lobster Taco' perfectly illustrates the casual elegance
that characterizes Southwest cuisine. Its appeal is rooted in the
combination of rich lobster and a simple flour tortilla. The salsa
and salad garnishes produce an explosion of color that promises
exciting dining".

1  handful parsley
1 small capsicum, chopped
3  green onions, chopped
1 tablespoon capers
1  salt and pepper to taste

one and makes an appetising first course or lunch dish.

In a food processor or blender. process together 200 ml extra- virgin
olive oil, 70 ml lemon juice, 2 cloves garlic. chopped, a generous
handful of parsley, one small or half a large green capsicum,
chopped, 3 green (spring) onions, roughly chopped, 1 tablespoon
capers and salt and pepper to taste. The sauce should be thick - if
necessary add more of the green ingredients. Poach 500-600 g
rudderfish gently, preferably in fish stock but at a pinch in water
with a little lemon juice, just until the fish flakes. Remove from
the poaching liquid and dry with paper towels. While the fish is
still quite hot, break it into fairly large chunks, pour the sauce
over it and turn over gently to coat. Serve the salad as it is or on
a layer of still-warm sliced new potatoes.

West Lake Fish

chinese, fish

1  fresh-water bass *
1 tablespoon dry sherry or rice wine
4  ginger slices
1  lots of water, boiling in a kettle
4 tablespoon sugar
6 tablespoon chekiang vinegar **
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 oz knob ginger
1  juice of 1 garlic,mashed
2 tablespoon cornstarch

(sweet-sour Hangchow dish, adapted from Joyce Chen's restaurant)

* other fresh-water fish may be substituted; a small striper may be
substituted in a pinch; look for 15-18" (1 1/2 to 2 lb) fish,
preferably one you caught yourself. You could also probably use 2 or
3 bluegills

** substitute cider vinegar, white wine vinegar, or possibly balsamic

Clean, gut, scale, and rinse fish. Cut through skin three diagonal
cuts on each side like so /// .

Put fish, sherry, and ginger slices into kettle of boiling water.
Water should cover the fish. Cover tightly and immediately turn off
heat. Let stand 15 min.

Meanwhile, mix all the rest of the ingredients and cook over
medium-high heat until sauce thickens. Remove garlic if used. Keep
very hot.

Remove fish carefully from water. Drain and gently pat dry. Pour
boiling sauce over and serve immediately.

Variation: cut sugar to 1 T; cut vinegar to 2 T. Increase soy sauce
to 3 T; add 2 T dry sherry to sauce ingredients; add 2 T chicken
broth to sauce ingredients. This obviously is no longer West Lake
fish but a more standard soy sauce fish.

Whole Baked Fish With Dill

fish, herbs, main dish, rice

3 lb whole fish - preferably fresh
4  shallots; peeled - finely chopped
8 medium mushrooms; sliced
6  fresh dill sprigs
1  salt & white pepper to taste
1  lemon juice; to taste
1  butter
1 cup clam juice or fish stock
1  white wine
1/2 cup whipping cream
2  to 3 tb. beurre manie
      ----GARNISH----
1  whole dill sprigs
1  dilled lemon slices

Enright writes: "In Canada, fresh whiting is sold most months, while
springtime and summer bring a selection of...salmon, trout, pickerel
and perch.  Fresh or frozen fillets (sole, perch, haddock, turbot)
may be substituted, but be sure to reduce cooking time."

Have the fish "dressed," that is, scaled, eviscerated and fins
removed. To behead or not is up to you.  To bake fish, the rule of
thumb is: 10 minutes per inch thickness of fresh fish (measured at
its thickest point) or for frozen fish, 20 minutes cooking time for
each inch thickness.

Butter an oval baking dish large enough to hold fish. Sprinkle pan
with half the shallots, mushrooms and dill sprigs. Lay fish on top.
Season with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Place remaining shallots,
mushrooms and dill sprigs on top of fish; dot with butter.

Combine clam juice or stock with white wine; pour around fish. Loosely
cover pan with foil and bake at 450 F. until fish flakes when tested
with a fork. Remove fish to heated platter. Debone and keep warm in
low oven. Strain pan juices into a medium, heavy saucepan. Discard
dill but reserve shallots and mushrooms. Add cream and boil over high
heat to reduce sauce by one third.  Whisk in beurre manie a bit at a
time until the sauce is sufficiently thick. Season with salt, pepper
and lemon juice. Add reserved shallots and mushrooms. Pour some sauce
over baked fish and serve remainder separately.

Garnish with whole dill sprigs and dilled lemon slices. (For these,
mince dill and place on cutting board. Gently fold a lemon slice in
half and roll onto the minced dill to form a center band of dill.)

Serve with white rice seasoned with fresh lemon thyme and sauteed baby
carrots or broiled tomato halves.

Whole Salmon With Dill Sauce

seafood

1  whole salmon (about 6 lb)
2 quart court bouillon
2 cup cumbers
2  lemons
1 pint sour cream
1 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup grated onion
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill

and allow 10 minutes for each inch of thickness; begin timing when
the liquid starts to simmer. To check for doneness, insert a metal
skewer into the thick flesh behind the gill. It should slide in
easily. A six-pound salmon needs either a fish poacher or a roasting
pan fitted with a rack at the bottom for easy fish lifting. I use a
roaster. It usually means the fish has been curved to fit in, and the
benefit of this is that it retains this jaunty pose once cooked so it
fits more easily onto a platter. Chill it carefully, then unwrap it,
and gently pull off the skin. If the fat underneath the skin is gray,
scrape it away with a knife to reveal the orange flesh. Cut down the
center of the fish to the backbone, and then ease one half of the
fillet from the bones. Gently pull off the flesh, then remove the
backbone and replace the fish. This way it is easier to serve at a
buffet. Peel and halve the cucumbers. Scrape out the seeds, and then
thinly slice them. Arrange cucumber on top of the salmon in a pattern
resembling fish scales. Slice a lemon, and arrange around the fish.
Chill well. For the sauce, combine the sour cream with the
mayonnaise, and whisk until smooth. Add the onion, lemon juice, dill,
salt and pepper. Serves 10 to 12, or more if there are other entrees.
Note: The fish can be cooked up to a day in advance and refrigerated,
tightly covered. The sauce can be made up to two days in advance and
refrigerated.

Yum Pra-Hmik (Thai Squid "Salad").

appetizers, oriental, seafood, thai

1 lb fresh squids.
1 tablespoon fresh ginger root, julienne.
1 tablespoon lemongrass, sliced fine.
2 tablespoon onion, chopped.
3 tablespoon lime or lemon juice.
3 tablespoon fish sauce.
1 tablespoon scallions, chopped.
1 tablespoon cilantro, chopped.
1/2 cup mint leaves.
10  crushed hot chili peppers.

Clean and wash the fresh squids, removing all inner matters and skin.
Cut through the side so that the meat is in a single "sheet". Cut the
meat into strips about 3/4" to 1" wide and 2" long. If desired, slash
one side in a close criss-cross patterns, and the strip will curl
into a roll upon cooking.  Place the squid pieces into a wire
strainer with long handle. Boil a pot of water, and immerse the
strainer with the squid meat into the boiling water to cook.  For
very fresh squid, cook until the meat had turned opaque and heated
through. For frozen, or "not so fresh" squid, it is advisable to cook
a little longer.  Lift the squid out of the boiling water and let
drain in the strainer. Place the well drained squid meat into a bowl
and add fish sauce and lime or lemon juice. Adjust tastes by adding
more of either ingredients. The tastes should be tangy sour with
sufficient salty tastes. Add lemongrass, ginger roots (very finely
julienne), and chopped onions, and mix well. (Optionally, you may add
dry ground hot chilli pepper to taste). Place on a serving platter
(lined with lettuce leaves) and topped with chopped scallions,
cilantro, mint leaves, and crushed hot chilli peppers. Translated by
Padej Gajajiva from a Thai cookbook, "Thai Cuisine" by Chantr
