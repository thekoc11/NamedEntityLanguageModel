100% Whole Wheat Bread

abm

      ----MODIFIED BY SYLVIA STEIGER----
1 tablespoon yeast
3 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 tablespoon salt
3/8 cup gluten
1 tablespoon oil
1 tablespoon sugar; or honey
1 5/8 cup water

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order.
Set "baking control" to medium.  Select "white bread" and push Start.

Tested in DAK 1-1/2 lb R2D2 bread machine.  Sylvia's comment: Very fluffy
loaf!  With less gluten, it became a damp bread.  I cut down the sugar to
make it easier to slice without affecting the fluffiness.

100% WHOLE WHEAT BREAD (ABM)

abm

1 1/8 cup water
3 cup whole wheat flour
3 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon active dry yeast

This is pretty heavy bread, but I like it that way. For a better
raise, try adding 1/3 cup of gluten, and you may need a bit more
water, then.

Use Whole Wheat mode. Timer ok.

Note: Whole wheat varies greatly in how much water it absorbs. The
amounts of water shown are the ones that work for me. Check on the
dough after the first few minutes of kneading. If it is too thin, add
flour, 1 T at the time. If the dough is too dry and does not form a
smooth ball, add water, 1 T at the time. Since bread machines can
handle relatively moist do, it is better to err on the moist side
(which will result in heavier bread, if it is much too much).

100% WHOLE WHEAT BREAD (MACHINE) - LARGE LOAF

breads, abm

1 1/2 cup + 2 t   water
3 3/4 cup wheat bread flour
2 tablespoon dry milk
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon honey

1 tablespoon molasses
1 1/8 teaspoon yeast, fast rise or machine  or -
3 teaspoon yeast, active dry

Source:  Electric Bread

The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra
knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a
lighter loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset
the machine and start again - or use the whole wheat cycle, if it's
available on your machine.

100% WHOLE WHEAT BREAD FOR BREAD MACHINE

breads, abm

      ----REGULAR LOAF----
1 cup water
2 1/2 cup wheat bread flour
1 1/4 tablespoon dry milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon butter
1 1/4 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon gluten
2 teaspoon molasses
1 1/2 teaspoon fast-rise yeast *** or ***

1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 tablespoon gluten
1 tablespoon molasses
2 1/8 teaspoon fast-rise yeast *** or ***
3 teaspoon active-dry yeast

The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra
knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a
lighter loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset
the machine and start again.  Some manufacturers produce home
bakeries with a whole wheat cycle; if your machine doesn't have one,
this start- again method works as an easy alternative. SUCCESS HINTS:
The gluten gives the whole wheat flour the structure necessary for a
good loaf. If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local
health food store. Remember the extra knead.  It's especially
important in 100% whole wheat bread. Because of the extra knead, us
this recipe only on the regular bake cycle. CALORIES: 125 PROTEIN:

Abm-Eggnog Bread

abm, holiday

2 tablespoon sugar
1 pkg active dry yeast
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
3/4 cup eggnog; at room temp.*

I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for
the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may
need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with
it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too
dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!
* Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the
microwave) Place ingredients. in the B/M according to your
manufacturers' directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as
needed This made a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of
my breadmaker. I used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness
or darkness button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a
Welbilt). Let me know your results, we sure enjoyed it! FROM: LISA

Absolutely Apricot

fruits, abm

3 teaspoon yeast; (active dry)
3 cup bread flour
2 tablespoon dry milk
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup apricot jam
3/4 cup dried apricots; chopped water

If your machine offers the option, use the "light crust" setting as
the crust browns more due to the sugar content of the jam. Try to use
a jam with a high fruit content & few additives. This recipe can be
baked on the regular, rapid bake, or timed settings. I have a DAK
Turbo II & baked it on the reg setting.  It was one of the few loaves
that have turned out really well lately...think my DAK is dying; just
today ordered a ZOJI from Irwin. The bread kept VERY well in a
Rubbermaid container...was nice & fresh for a whole week (I forgot
about the last couple of slices!). I even made it when MY
mother-in-law came to visit & she LOVED it! Hope it turns out good
for you.

Adapted Pickle Juice Rye

breads, abm

      ----FRAN NOSSEN----
      ----ADAPTED BY LISA CRAWLEY----
3 cup bread flour
3 teaspoon fleischmann's active yeast
1 cup sour dill brine
3/4 cup water; warmed to 120 degrees
2 tablespoon crisco
2 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon dry dill weed
1 1/2 cup med. rye flour
1 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 lg. egg; room temp.

I used my crock dill brine and decreased the salt from the original
recipe which called for 2 ts. due to the high salt content of my
brine. I forgot the egg that is called for! I used 3 ts. Active Dry
Yeast instead of the 3 pkg. called for in the conventional recipe. I
warmed the brine and the water.

1/4 cup applesauce
1/4 cup water
1  egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
4 cup flour
1 tablespoon dry yeast

Process on "dough" cycle. The filling would be 1/2 cup melted
margarine or butter (I use 1/4 cup) topped with 1 cup brown sugar
mixed with 3 TBS cinnamon. (I add raisins and nuts.) The topping is 4
oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter or margarine (I skip this) 1/2 tsp.
vanilla, 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar and a teaspoon or two of milk.
I've done these both "full fat" and "reduced fat." It's hard to tell
the difference, so we go "reduced," including using light
(Neufchatel) cream cheese. I've tried ALL the fat free cream cheeses
and NONE of them work. JUDITH PENZINER (GGMB18A)JUDITH PENZINER

Artichoke & Cracked Wheat Bread - Breadmaker

abm

9 oz marinated artichoke hearts
1/2 tb yeast
1 1/2 c bread flour
1 1/2 c whole wheat flour
1/3 c cracked wheat
1 1/2 tb sugar
1/2 tb salt
1/4 ts black pepper
3 tb parmesan, grated
1 c water; warm

Drain artichoke hearts, reserving 3 tb liquid.  Bring all ingredients
to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order. Set "baking
control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and push Start.  In hot
and humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.  Since the flavor of this
loaf is not too assertive, but the texture is substantial, it is a
good sandwich bread for spicy meats, such as salami or pate, and ripe
cheese. For early in the day eating, toast and spread with orange
marmalade or apple butter.

B/M "SOUR" SOURDOUGH

breads, abm, ethnic

1 1/4 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup water
3 cup bread flour
1 tablespoon melted margarine
2 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon yeast

This basic recipe was from Anna Ellis (DMSD70C). I substituted oil
for the margarine and with some experimentation, came up with this
technique: Put all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle.
When the cycle is complete, leave the dough in the pan for 3 to 4
more hours. Remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a damp
towel and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes minutes. Sprinkle corn
meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical loaves. Place
loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet. Cover again with the damp
towel and allow to rise for another two hours. At the end of two
hours, refrigerate the dough, still covered, for at least 12 hours
(the longer the better). Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with
water, and let it sit out for 4 hours. Sprinkle again with water then
bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown and crusty.

more than the Cakebread with Jiffy.  I simply stored the leftover mix
for my next loaf.

B/M MOZZARELLA TOMATO BREAD

1 cup shredded mozzarella
1 tablespoon sundried tomatoes; crumbled
2 tablespoon dehydrated onion
1 teaspoon minced basil
2 cup bread flour
1 tablespoon dry milk
2 teaspoon dry yeast

I've been playing around with these ingredients and my husband thinks
I should "go public" with this recipe! It's for a bread machine, but
you could make it by hand in the conventional way, too. In my
Zojirushi machine the crust is rather dark (but still delicious) so
other machines may need a light crust setting. Enjoy! Place ingred.
in B/M in order given (start at bottom for>>>> Welbilt/Dak) set crust
to light and bake on white bread setting. I'm munching on the "heel"
as I type and am thinking about how good a sandwich will be in a few
hours! Maybe next time I'll add pepperoni and have all the sandwich
ingredients in each slice. It has a real pizza taste! LINDA IN

need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with
it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too
dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!
* Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the
microwave) Place ingred. in the B/M according to your manufacturers'
directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as needed This made
a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of my breadmaker. I
used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness or darkness

Although the bread machine cannot, by itself, make a bagel-textured
bread, by putting my favorite bagel toppings into the dough, I can at least
approximate the flavor of a chewy New York Bagel. Serve this one with
smoked salmon and cream cheese for brunch if you cannot get good bagels
nearby.
Bake according to manufacturer's instructions, adding the onions during
the raisin-bread cycle, or five minutes before the final kneading is
finished...

Set for dough cycle.Let the machine knead the dough once, and then
let the dough rise for only 20 minutes in the machine. Even if your
cycle runs longer, simply remove dough after 20 minutes and turn off
the machine. Divide the dough into the appropriate number of pieces.
Each piece should be rolled into a rope and made into a circle,
pressing the ends together. You may find it necessary to wet one end
slightly to help seal the ends together.

Place these on a well greased baking sheet, cover and let rise only
15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring to a slight boil in a "nonaluminum
pan", (Donna German uses a cast iron frying pan) about 2 inches of
water. Carefully lower about 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the water,
cooking for about 30 seconds on each side. Remove bagels, drain on a
towel, sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame seeds or dried onion bits if
desired and place on the greased baking sheet. Bake in a preheated
550    degree oven for 8 minutes.

Baked Pretzels

breads, snacks

1 1/2 teaspoon yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup bread flour
1/2 cup egg substitute
1/4 cup water
1 egg white
1 tablespoon water

Add yeast, salt, bread flour, egg substitute, and 1/2 cup water in the
order suggested by the bread machine manufacturer and process on the
dough cycle. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray baking sheet
with nonfat cooking spray. When the dough cycle is complete, remove
dough and place on lightly-floured surface. Roll dough into 12x4-inch
rectangle and cut into 8 (12-inch) strips. Pull each strip to about
14 inches in length. Form dough into pretzel shape: Make a circle;
cross the ends at the top, twist the ends once and lay over the
bottom of the circle. Pretzel logs can also be shaped just by making
rolled dough into a 12- to 14-inch rope. Place pretzels on prepared
baking sheet. In a small bowl, combine egg white with 1 tablespoon
water and brush on pretzels. If desired, sprinkle pretzels with
coarse salt, sesame, or poppy seeds. Bake in preheated oven 15 to 20
seconds. Serve with mustard or cheese dip.

Banana Tea Loaf

breadmachine, diabetic

2  bananas; ripe, mashed
1/2 cup canola oil like crisco
2 large eggs
2 tablespoon frozen orange/pineapp. conc.
1 3/4 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon orange peel
1 cooking spray

Adapted from The Joslin Diabetes Gourmet Cookbook, 1993 which used 1
large egg white plus 6 tbsp. egg substitute, 1/8 tsp almond extract,
orange juice concentrate, 2 cups unbleached flour and no orange peel.

Original nutritional info. 1/18 recipe = 1 bread, 1 fat Joslin
Exchanges 122 calories, 2 grams protein, 14 grams carbohydrate, 6
grams fat (44% of calories), trace cholesterol, 61 mg sodium, 105 mg
potassium.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Line a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan with waxed paper
and spray with cooking spray.

In a large bowl, combine bananas, oil, beaten egg, juice concentrate
and orange peel.  Stir dry ingredients together and then stir them
into banana mixture until just blended.

Spread the batter in the pan and bake for 45 minutes or until the top
is lightly browned.  Cool in a pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a
wire rack.  Slice the first sample while the loaf is still warm.
Comment in the original recipe states that the well-wrapped loaf
keeps in the refrigerator and freezes well. Slice is smaller than a
slice of regular bread (about half size).

Tested with changes noted by Elizabeth Rodier, Jan 1994. To cut down
on cholesterol use 1 whole egg and 2 whites, or home made egg
substitute.

When comparing bread recipes, consider serving size as well as
calories. Does the serving taste good alone or would I add 1 tsp
margarine (1 fat)?

1 tb peanut butter would add 1 fat exchange + 1 meat or 95 calories, 3
grams carb. 4 grams protein, 8.2 grams fat, 98 mg sodium

1 tb regular strawberry jam made of equal parts fruit and sugar would
add 54 calories, 14 grams carbohydrate or 1 fruit exchange

Basic Bread Machine Recipe

breads, breadmachine, low fat

2 3/4 teaspoon yeast
1 teaspoon malt
11 oz water (110 - 120 deg.f)
3 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup unbleached white flour
2 tablespoon sugar, honey, molasses...
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon gluten

put yeast and malt into machine with several oz. of water. Use a
thermometer for the water. Too hot will kill the yeast. The yeast
will now proof (start to multiply) In a separate bowl, measure out
all dry ingredients and mix. After a few minutes, yeast should be
bubbling, add dry stuff and any liquids including the water. start
the machine and see how it looks. If too dry, add until it looks
right. Should be one big mass not several. Flour:  I often substitute
1 cup of corn or rye + 1 heaping T of gluten for a cup of WW flour.
For sweet breads, add another few T of sugar (I commonly use honey,
molasses, or malt powder) and may some raisins. 3 T of carroway seeds
or sesame seeds in a non sweet bread is great. I have also added 2
mashed bananas, then cut the water.

Load machine according to manufacturer's directions and bake on machine's
quick bread cycle.
According to "story" just before the recipe - this is a light,
open-textured, simple bread and it doesn't keep very well - considering
that Basque Shepherds from Northern Spain - prepared the dough each morning
for the evening meal.
The shepherd would place the dough in a special iron pot and bury it in
the coals of his campfire in the morning. On his return from tending his
flock the pot of bread would be ready. The top of the bread would then be
slashed to form a cross before the evening meal - and the 1st pc. was
always given to the herder's sheepdog.

Bean Biscuits

breadmachine, diabetic, beans

1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
4 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup butter or soft margarine
1 cup cooked kidney beans wt / red
2/3 cup 2% milk

Revised after testing Feb 94.  Used 1 1/2 cup flour NOT 2 1/2 cups as
printed in the book.  The 1 cup beans probably replaced 1 cup flour
in the original recipe.

Stir dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.  Cut in butter until
mixture resembles crumbs.

In food processor or blender, puree beans with milk. OR mash beans
and stir in milk.  Stir into dry ingredients all at once to make
light soft dough.

Turn out onto lightly floured board, sprinkle with flour and knead
about 20 seconds.

Shape biscuits by rolling, patting and cutting or divide dough into 16
pieces and shape by hand.

Bake at 400 F for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.

Big Soft Pretzels

breads, breadmachine, snacks, mixes

1 tablespoon dry yeast
5 cup bread mix; up to six lukewarm water
2  eggs; beaten
      ----TOPPING----
1  egg; beaten
2 tablespoon coarse salt
1/2 cup butter; melted

Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.  In a large bowl, dissolve
yeast in lukewarm water.  Blend in 2 eggs and butter. Add 5 cups
bread mix. Stir well.  Add additional bread mix to make a soft, but
not too sticky dough. Knead about 5 minutes until dough is smooth.
Roll pieces of dough into ropes about 1/2 inch in diameter and 18 to
24 inches long. Form into pretzel shapes.  For pretzel sticks, cut
dough into 5 to 6 inch lengths. Place on prepared baking sheets.
Preheat oven to 425.

Brush tops of pretzels with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse salt.
Bake immediately 12 to 15 minutes, until brown and crisp. Makes 12 to
15 large pretzels.

Variation For a chewier pretzel, drop pretzel-shaped dough into a pan
of boiling water.  When dough floats to the top of the water, remove
it. Preheat oven to 400. Brush with egg and sprinkle with coarse
salt. Bake about 30 minutes.

All of these recipes I have posted using my bread mix can be adjusted
to use with the bread machine, some using the dough setting. I have
had excellent results. Will try to post more over the weekend as I
get time. Also have a lot of other "mix" recipes if anyone is

Bloody Maria Bread

breads

3 cup bread flour
1 1/4 cup v-8 vegetable juice
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg yeast; rapid rising
1 teaspoon rosemary; ground
1 teaspoon basil; ground
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder; or flakes
1/2 teaspoon oregano
2 tablespoon virgin olive oil
1 tabasco sauce

I'll have to admit that when I make this bread I usually use the V-8
mixture that I have in the refrigerator. I add a much larger quantity
of the herbs that are listed to a bottle of V-8 and let it set. It
makes a nice drink with or without vodka. If you drink it with vodka,
it's a "Bloody Mary," without vodka, it's a "Bloody Shame." The bread
tastes better if you mix the herbs in the V-8 at least 24 hours
before baking. Be that as it may - add all ingredients to the baking
container of your machine and bake on basic bread cycle. It's a
"speecy" bread and goes with well "speecy meata balls."

This delightful bread is great for parties and celebrations. The
raisins and nuts give it a fextive flavor and texture that's hard to
beat.

Because this bread is an extremely high rise, a 1-pound loaf will
easily fill a large bread-machine bucket. Test the small recipe first
to see how the loaf rises in your machine.

Follow manufacturer's directions on loading.

2/3 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
2 cup branola cereal
2 cup bread flour

Bread Machine Tips

breads

  :  directions only

Bread Machine Tips

1.Use good quality hard wheat unbleached, unbromated flour that has at
least 12 grams of protein per cup. (I like King Arthur) 2.Use fresh,
quick dissolving active yeast, not rapid rise. 3.Open the machine and
check the dough during the first 5 - 10 minutes of the first kneading
cycle!!! Even if your manual says not to do it: flour acts as a
sponge absorbing moisture on wet days and becoming dehydrated during
dry weather. You'll have to adjust for fluctuating humidity and
barometric pressure by adding small amounts of flour or liquid to the
dough. 4.If you've never made bread before and don't know what dough
is supposed to look like, buy a package of frozen bread dough
(available at your local supermarket), and let it defrost according
to the package directions. Place it on a lightly floured surface and
play with it until you are familiar with the consistency. This is
what you're aiming for in the bread machine. 5.Now, to adjust the
dough in your bread machine during the first knead cycle: wait until
the ingredients have been kneaded for 3-4 minutes. If the dough looks
sticky and wet and is coating the bottom and sides of the pan, then
sprinkle in flour, a tablespoon at a time (you may need up to an
extra 1/2 cup) while the machine is kneading, until you have a
smooth, supple ball of dough. If the mixture is dry and corrugated
looking or the dough doesn't hold together then sprinkle in
additional liquid, a little at a time, until the dough is smooth and
pliable and forms a cohesive ball. If you've wandered away from your
machine only to return to find a wet messy glob or a dry desert
thumping around in the machine, press stop (you can do this at any
time - except if the machine has gone into the bake cycle), add a
small amount of flour or liquid and press start. Stick around and
make additional adjustments, if necessary, until the dough looks
right. 6.I have found that when you are either making dough, or
placing the ingredients in the machine to make bread at that time,
you can add either the liquids first or the dry ingredients first.
The major exception to this is the old dak (no longer made) where the
yeast must be placed in the bread pan first in a position farthest
away from the kneading blade. When programming ahead make sure to
place any dried fruits away from contact with wet ingredients as they
will absorb those liquids and throw off the recipe.

Extra kneads and extra rise times all contribute to the depth of
flavor, character of the crumb and general personality of a loaf of
bread. One of the reasons I dislike rapid rise yeast and rapid cycles
on the bread machines is that the dough really requires the entire
life span of the yeast to become the amazing miracle that is bread.
If you are partial to whole grain breads and are winding up with
lower loaves than you wish, then try a double knead cycle: place the
ingredients in the machine and program for dough or manual. At the
end of the final knead reprogram the machine for bread (of Whole
Wheat) and press start. You've given the dough an extra work-out to
develop the gluten - that will result in a higher loaf. For an even
higher loaf you can (if your machine permits) program for a longer
rise time, or simply remove the dough from the pan after the final
rise cycle (but before baking) transfer it to a bread pan and allow
it to raise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Then bake it in
the oven.

Sweet doughs with lots of butter and eggs also respond well to a
second long rise in a cool place. I remove my brioche from the
machine after the dough cycle is complete. I place it in a large
freezer strength zip lock bag and refrigerate it overnight. Then I
place it back in the machine (my Zojirushi has flexible programming),
program for 2nd rise and bake. If you can't program your machine this
way you can place the dough in a bread pan after you remove it from
the machine, give it a long, refrigerated rise, and then bake it in
the oven. Even non-wheat and non-sweet doughs can benefit from this
extra rise.

Bread Making ( Lesson One Of Four)

breads

1 bread making (without a

This is a Public Service Post brought to you from the Bourbon Cowboy
re: "Bread Making"...

Anyone who owns a Bread Making Machine, please skip this message...

A lot of folks think that making bread "from scratch" is a lost,
arcane art, practised by li'l old ladies in pink pinafores. Well,
this ol' cowpoke is here to tell ya' that ANYONE can make bread, from
"scratch"...and it's not all that difficult.  Time consuming,
perhaps, but bear with me, and let's see what happens...

First off, let me give y'all a little Bread History...

Bread Making ( Lesson Three Of Four)

breads

1 bread lesson 3

Hello once again, all you li'l ol' bread-makers! Ready for lesson
three?

First, let's review the basic recipe:

3 cups all-purpose flour 1 package yeast
1 1/4    cups water

Mix, knead, let rise, punch down, let rise, bake.

Hopefully you've tried a couple of loaves of this and are fairly
comfortable with the technique.  Now, try this:

To the basic recipe, add one teaspoon of salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons of
sugar, 1 egg, and substitute milk for water. After the second rise,
just before you pop it in the oven, sprinkle some dill seed or sesame
seed on top.

An important note here is do NOT "guesstimate" the sugar and/or salt.
You can get away with this when making chili or squid, but NOT when
baking.

Now it's starting to look and taste a little more like bread.

Note that home-made bread will NOT "keep" for longer than a day or so
before it becomes hard as a rock. This is normal, and is why our
forefathers had recipes for such neat stuff as bread pudding, bread

It's also interesting to note that the basic recipe makes a KILLER
pizza dough, if you're into home-made pizza. I'll leave the add-ons
as an exercise for the student, as no two people can ever agree on
what makes a good pizza filling.

BREAD: MACHINE: HAZLENUT-AMARETTO LOAF

breads, nuts

      ----1POUND LOAF----
2 cup bread flour
2/3 cup milk
1/2 cup toasted chopped hazelnuts
1  egg
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon margarine or butter
4 teaspoon amaretto or hazelnut liqueur
3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 recipe amaretto glaze
1 toasted chopped hazlenuts or
1 almonds (optional) 
      ----AMARETTO GLAZE----
1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar
1 tablespoon amaretto or hazelnut
1  liqueur
1  *or*
1 tablespoon almond extract
1 to 2 tablespoons milk *if
1  needed

Serve slices of this nutty sweet breat for breakfast, brunch, or an
afternoon coffee break --

BREAD DIRECTIONS: Add flour, milk, the nuts, egg, sugar, margarine or
butter, liqueur, yeast, and salt to the bread machine according to the
manufacturer's directions. Bake and cool as directed. When brread is
cool, drizzle with Amaretto Glaze.

AMARETTO GLAZE: In a small mixing bowl combine sugar, amaretto or
hanelnut liqueur *OR* almond extract.  If needed, add 1 to 2
teaspoons milk to make of drizzling consistency.

BREAD MACHINE BASICS: These helpful tips apply to all types of bread
machines: Bread flour, which is high in protein, works best for
breads made in a bread machine. You can use other grains or flours
with the bread flour but not in place of all of it.  Some recipes
also call for a small amount of gluten flour. This helps breads,
especially those made with low-gluten flours (such as whole wheat
flour), hold together.

Add ingredients to the bread machine in the order specified by the
directions in the owner's manual.

To use powdered milk instead of fresh, add 1/3 cup nonfat dry milk
powder for each 1 cup of water and add it with the flour. Always use
powdered milk when using the timer on your machine.

These recipes come from the BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS BREAD MACHINE
BOUNTY COOKBOOK.  To order the book, call 800/678-2665. Or, write to

included with the recipe, and I thought it unfair to leave it off.

      ----INFORMATION ONLY----

SOURCE:  Linda Rehberg on *P - ID #GNJX21A.  Note on Foods BB - Breads
by Machine - dated 12/20/93 to Ursula R. Taylor.
You should be able to convert dog biscuit recipes to your bread machine.
If you have a 1 1/2 lb. machine, use about 1 cup liquid (eggs count as a
scant 1/4 cup liquid) and a total of 3 cups of dry ingredients (flour and
grains).  If the mixture is too stiff for your machine to mix easily, add 1
to 2 tbsp. more liquid. Hope this helps.
This note was formated by Ursula R. Taylor...Note from Ursula - using
this method - use only dough cycle, then remove and roll or pat dough out
and bake in the oven....

BREADMAKER HINTS #1 REV

breadmachine

1 judy garnett pjxg05a

Make sure that all ingredients are at LEAST room temp. Put all
ingredients in bread pan in order listed. Yeast must be fresh! I keep
it in the refrigerator, but bringing to room temp. only takes a few
minutes. If you are making bread other than white, you may need to
add gluten and/or lecithin to your dough. They are especially helpful
when making whole wheat, rye or other heavier type breads. They help
improve elasticity of the dough. (They are usually available at
Health Food stores and I have found Lethicin near the Vitamins at
Pharmor.) I usually set the dark/light setting to "11 o'clock" unless
I'm making sweet bread, then I set it back to about "9 o'clock". The
key to using the auto-breadmaker is to have the correct proportion of
flour to liquid. After the dough has kneaded for a few minutes in the
breadmaker, look in and see if there is ONE ball of dough which is
incorporating most of the flour from the sides of the pan. If it's a
"gooey mess", add 1 T. flour until it makes ONE SOFT ball. If there
are two or more balls, add 1 T water and see if it makes 1 ball. (You
may have to go back and forth with this until you get it right <G>)
While it's in its first knead (BEFORE it goes into the fermentation
cycle), open the lid and touch the dough lightly. It should be in one
soft ball. If your finger has sticky dough on it, add a Tablespoon of
flour. Let it knead a minute and touch it again and check to see if
it's still sticky. Keep adding a tablespoon at a time ONLY until it's
no longer sticky, DON'T OVERDO IT. If it just makes a slight
indentation and doesn't look crusty, it's probably about right. If it
feels too dry or is in two or more DRY-looking balls (not a sticky
mass), add a tablespoon at a time of WARM water. PLEASE DON'T ADD TOO
MUCH LIQUID. If you add too much liquid in proportion to the flour,
the dough may rise too much and overflow. If you look in and see that
the dough is threatening to rise up over the top of the bread pan,
don't panic, poke it a few times with a toothpick, skewer, fork,etc.
until it deflates a little. PLEASE SEE BREADMAKER HINTS #2 Rev for
continutation of hints. Written in 1991

BREADMAKER HINTS #2 REV

breadmachine, info

1 judy garnett pjxg05a

I've found that I can use butter, margarine, diet margarine
(although it does add a little moisture), olive oil, etc. for the
fat. I add 3 T. buttermilk powder to many of the recipes. I add it on
top of the flour, but I have heard that many people add it right
after the yeast. Eggbeaters and dry egg substitutes work fine, too. I
often add 1/2 cup of sourdough starter to my breads. I have 3
starters: white sourdough, potato (sweet bread) starter, and whole
wheat starter. I decrease the water or milk called for in recipes
when I add a starter.
Although the DAK takes 3 c flour, you can use more if you are making
whole wheat or other dark breads because it doesn't rise as much. If
you are making rye or pumpernickel, your bread will be a smaller,
denser loaf when baked. If you are adding nuts or raisins to your
recipe, shake them in a baggie with about 2 tsp. flour BEFORE adding
them to the dough. The time to add them is towards the END of the
second cycle when you hear the beeps. Raisins add a little moisture
to the dough so you'll probably need a tad more flour after adding
them in order for the dough not to be sticky.
I know that there are gadgets out now to help with slicing
Breadmaker Bread, however I still use my trusty electric knife to
slice it. Since my Breadmaker makes round bread, I slice it in half
vertically first and then slice each half into slices. After it has
COMPLETELY cooled, I store it in baggies. The first day, I just leave
it on the counter. After that, I store it in the refrig. or freezer.

2 cup bread flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2  garlic cloves, crushed
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup parmesan, grated
3 tablespoon olive oil
4  anchovies; chopped
1/2 teaspoon lemon peel, grated
1 1/2 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup water; warm

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

If Caesar made bread instead of salad dressing, this would be it.
Sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes or tuna salad, or serve it with a
green salad. For an hors d'oeuvre, toast slices and top with steak
tartare or a sliver of rare roast beef. The crusty ends can be cut
into croutons, toasted in a frying pan, and tossed in a salad.

California Dip Bread (Abm)*

breads

1 pkg yeast
3 1/3 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1  egg
3/4 cup cottage cheese
3/4 cup sour cream
3 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup water
1  envelope lipton's onion

Slightly warm the next 6 ingredients and pour into pan. Select white
bread and push 'start'.

NOTE:  I have made this recipe manually, and it's fabulous. I used an
entire envelope of Lipton's Recipe Secrets (Onion), and did the
following:

Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 warm water in the bottom of large mixing
bowl. Add the butter, egg, sour cream, and cottage cheese (all
slightly warmed) and mix well. Stir in the soup mix and the sugar,
and lastly the baking soda, mixing all well.  Add the flour about 1
cup at a time, mixing thoroughly - after last addition, start using
you hands to mix and knead. Knead well (about 10-15 minutes) until
dough is elastic (my dough was too sticky and I ended up adding a
little additional flour). Let rise until double (about 1 1/2 hours)
in a lightly greased bowl (<-- important! I didn't grease the bowl
and it got sticky on the bottom); punch down and knead lightly. Place
dough in greased baking container of choice, and let rise again until
double again (about another 45 minutes). Bake at 350 degrees for
40-45 minutes, or until cake tester comes out clean. Remove from pan
immediately and cool completely on cooling rack. This recipe made
enough for 1 loaf in my breadcrock (about 3/4 of the dough), and the
remaining 1/4 made 2 mini-loaves. The mini-loaves, however, only bake
about 15 minutes or so.  Would probably produce two regular-sized
loaf pans of bread. Would be excellent with deli meats or used
grilled for other sandwiches! The mini-loaves or a decorative tube
pan would turn it into wonderful cocktail bread.  Tastes like a very
moist, slightly sweet double-onion bagel.  I am anxious to use this
same recipe and experiment with other soup mixes!!

California Onion Bread Abm

breads

1 1/4 cup boiling water
1  ...
2 tablespoon powdered milk
2 tablespoon cooking oil
3 tablespoon molasses
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup bread flour

Combine soup and water in your bread machine's pan and let sit 15
minutes. Add the remaining ingredients in the order listed. Fire it
up on the "BREAD" setting. Let it cool completely, preferably
overnight to develop the onion flavor.  Toasting will also sharpen
the onion flavor.

To suit your own taste, you can vary the flour in any combination
equaling 3 cups.  Remember that 100% whole wheat will make a shorter
loaf.

Carrot-Raisin Bread

breads

2 1/4 teaspoon fermipan or red star dry yeast
3 cup bread flour
1/3 cup oat bran (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon nonfat dry milk powder (or more for; extra protein)
2 tablespoon canola oil
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup carrot pulp from the juicer (at roo; m temp.)
1 cup tepid water
3/4 cup raisins, added at the beep

Process on white bread setting. I prefer to start the machine with
only part of the water added, then add the rest in a slow drizzle
while it is running. That helps assure that I don't add too much
water if the weather is humid or the pulp moister than usual.

1 1/3 cup carrots, shredded
1/2 cup raisins, soaked in hot water
2  eggs
2 tablespoon vegetable oil

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Spray muffin tins.  (My suggestion: spray
paper muffin cups - low fat muffins tend to stick.)

Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Stir in carrots and drained
raisins.

Beat eggs with oil.  Stir into flour mixture.  Divide batter evenly
among 12 tins.  Bake for 30-35 minutes or until toothpick inserted in
center of muffin comes out clean.

This moist bread is wonderful eaten warm with honey.
You can buy cashew butter at specialty food shops and health-food stores;
or make your own by grinding one cup unsalted cashews in a blender or food
processor with a drizzle of vegetable oil until it becomes smooth.
Bake according to manufacturer's instructions, adding the cashews during
the raisin-bread cycle, or five minutes before the final kneading is
finished.

3 tablespoon dry milk; nonfat
1 tablespoon yeast; active dry
4 tablespoon gluten

Use the "standard" or "white bread" mode of your bread machine. I
have a one-pound bread machine (MK Seiko "Mr. Loaf") and this recipe
produces a high, lighter texture bread without growing beyond the
capacity of the bread case (bread pan). Makes great sandwiches and is
delicious toasted.

Challa

breads, jewish

2 1/2 cup water, tepid (about 110 f)
3 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon sugar
3  quick-rising dry yeast,  envelopes
3  eggs, beaten - at room temp
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 lb unbleached white flour
1  cornmeal, for baking
      ----EGG WASH----
2  egg yolks
1 tablespoon water
      ----GARNISH----
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Place the water, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty
electric mixer (KitchenAid K5A2 model works best). Stir to dissolve
the sugar. Add the yeast and stir to dissolve. Stir in the beaten
eggs and the oil. Beat in 5 cups of the weighed-out flour to make a
batter. Beat for 5 minutes or until the batter begins to pull away
from the sides of the bowl. Knead in the remaining flour by machine
until smooth. Place the dough on a clean countertop and cover it with
a large metal bowl. Allow the dough to rise until double in bulk.
Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. Punch the dough
down again and divide it in half. Cut each half into thirds. Roll 3
of the pieces into ropes about 16 inches long with your hands. Join 1
end of each rope and press together with the heel of your hand.
Alternately, braid the 3 ropse together and press the other 3 ends
together with the heel of your hand..
Sprinkle a large baking sheet with a little of the cornmeal.
Place the braided dough on the sheet pan and allow it to double in
bulk again. Repeat the process with the remaining dough. Allow the
dough to rise until double in bulk.
Beat the 2 egg yolks and 1 tablespoon of water together for the
egg wash. Lightly brush both risen braided doughs. Sprinkle with
sesame seeds.
Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 50 to 60 minutes, until loaves
are deep golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottoms
with your finger. Remove to a cooling rack. Source: Whole Family

Cheese Buns (Bulemas "Falsos" For Shelly)

appetizers, breadmachine, jewish

      ----DOUGH----
1 cup water
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
3 cup bread flour
2 1/2 teaspoon yeast
      ----FILLING----
1/3 cup feta cheese; grated
1/3 cup parmesan or romano cheese
      ----MISC----
1 oz vegetable oil; approx

Grate all cheeses. (You may use parmesan or romano cheese or a
mixture of both. Amounts are approximate.) Place some of the
parmesan/romano cheese in a small bowl. Mix the remaining cheeses
together. Make the dough using the "dough" cycle of the Breadmaker.
When done; take the dough out of the pan and squeeze out gasses. Make
12 balls of dough and place temporarily in a baking pan that is lined
with vegetable oil. One at a time, take each ball and spread or roll
(rolling pin is fine) into a six or seven inch circle. Place a
generous strip of the cheese mixture along one side and roll up like
a log. Gently make a coil out of each log. If necessary, seal the end
with a little water. Dip the top in some additional parmesan on an
ungreased cookie sheet. Repeat until all of the balls look like cute
little buns, then bake at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes or until lightly
browned. This recipe was adapted for the breadmaker from Mom's recipe
for Spinach Bulemas. I leave out the spinach because my husband,
Shelly, HATES spinach! As a part of our Sephardic (Jewish) family
tradition, Bulemas and hard boiled eggs are served before the main
meal on holidays and after returning from synagogue on Saturdays.

I usually squeeze the chilies between a couple of layers of paper
towels to get rid of the excess moisture. If you don't want to use
green chilies, add about 1/2 tsp. of ground red pepper. Pour in all
ingredients (EXCEPT cheese and chilies) in the order listed (or if
your machine takes wet ingredients first, reverse the order) Select
white bread and push "Start". After the first knead, at the beeps,
add the chilies and the cheddar cheese. When the bread is finished
baking brush on some margarine or butter to the crust.

1  egg; unbeaten

1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Hi there!  I use this recipe in my bread machine but you could bake
it in two loaf pans just as easily. It's heavenly when it's warm and
spread with cream cheese! All I have to do is dump the ingredients
into the bread machine and press a button.  You'd have to knead, etc.
without one. Possible, but I have no pioneer spirit.

1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup mini, semisweet chocolate
1  chips

This is untested.  For my Hitachi I would probably use less water
than this original recipe calls for.

Important to check the dough while kneading to see if additional
flour may be needed!!!

Depending on machine either your loaf will come out with most of the
chocolate chips whole, of if your bread machine warms up during
kneading and rising, the chocolate chips will melt to produce a
chocolate dough.

Have all ingredients at room temperature.  Add ingredients in the
order specified by your machine. Add chocolate chips at the
appropriate moment for your machine. Set bread machine on basic bread
making setting. If possible use light baking cycle, if not use normal
setting.

Christy's Christmas Trees

breads, holiday, machine

      ----1 1/2 POUND----
      ----DOUGH----
7/8 cup buttermilk; for welbilt/dak and zojir
1  egg
3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon red star active dry yeast
      ----ICING----
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon milk or eggnog; up to 1.5 tb
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1  green food coloring
      ----GARNISH----
1  cinnamon red hot candies

1.  Place  dough ingredients in bread pan, select Dough setting, and
press Start.

2.  When the dough has risen long enough, the machine will beep. Turn
off bread machine, remove bread pan, and turn out dough onto a
lightly floured countertop or cutting board. Gently roll and stretch
dough into an 18-inch rope.  Grease a large baking sheet(s).

With a sharp knife, divide the dough into 17 pieces. Roll each piece
into a ball and place it on the greased baking sheet in the shape of
a Christmas tree, spaced about a half-inch apart; 5 balls for the
bottom roll, 4 balls for the next row, 3 balls for the next row, 2
balls for the next row, and 1 ball at the top. Combine the remaining
2 balls into 1 large ball, gently roll it into a thick rope and shape
it into an "S" to form the tree trunk.

VARIATION:  This recipe makes one large Christmas tree coffee cake. To
create 2, 4, or 6 smaller trees, simply divide the dough into 2, 4,
or 6 pieces initially and then follow the directions for dividing up
the dough and shaping each tree.

3.  Cover and let rise in a warm oven for 30 to 45 minutes until
doubled. (Hint:  To warm oven slightly, turn oven on Warm setting for
1 minute, then turn it off, and place covered dough in oven to rise.
Remove from oven to preheat.)  Remove baking sheet(s) from oven.
Preheat oven to 375 F.

4.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown.  Cool on a cake rack.

5.  When the coffee cake(s) is cooled, in a small bowl, combine the
icing ingredients, adding enough liquid to make the icing thin enough
to spread over the coffee cake. Spread each roll with icing, then
decorate with cinnamon red hot candies.

Yields 1 Christmas tree coffee cake.  Nutritional information per

Joyce's Notes:  For a cinnamon nut coffee cake, I added 1 tsp. of
cinnamon and about 1/2 cups chopped pecans. Good!! I also made 2
trees by dividing the dough in half, then making 12 balls, using 10
for the tree and 2 for the trunk.

Cinco De Mayo Bread

breadmachine, ethnic

1  pam gonzalez   (gfns81b)
2/3 cup water
2 cup white bread flour
2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon olive oil
2/3 cup corn meal
1/3 cup creamed corn
2 tablespoon green chilies; (canned; dice
1 teaspoon jalapeno peppers; (canned; d
1 teaspoon dried cilantro
2 teaspoon yeast

This is from Electric Bread.  I'm putting the ingreds for what they
call a "regular loaf" because the "large loaf" could've been used for
special effects for a volcanic eruption. My sister and I are drooling
over the idea of serving this with chili at a football party this
fall. Would also be great cut into triangles (which is how I cut my
bread when I don't want to plop a big square slice >>> down for
somebody); toasted, then run under the broiler with cheddar cheese on
it. YUMMM. Make sure to drain chilies and peppers well; don't get
juice in eyes; I didn't bother to chop since they were decimated by
the kneading anyway... Adios! 07/16 04:58 pm EDT

Cinnabon Cinnamon Rolls

breads, breadmachine, deserts

4 tablespoon melted butter
4 tablespoon water
1/2  box instant vanilla pudding (1/2 of; a 3.4oz. box)
1 cup milk
1  egg; (beaten)
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cup bread flour
2 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast fill with:
1/2 cup softened butter
1 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon

ROLLS: Place ingredients in machine following the specifications of
that particular machine.  Set for dough cycle (about 1 hr. 40 minutes
in my Hitachi B101 ~ Debbie Carlson). After complete on dough cycle,
remove from machine & roll out to 17 x 10 (approx) rectangle.

FILLING: Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread softened
butter over dough. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over
top. Roll tightly from long end, pinching edges closed when
completely rolled. Slice rolled dough into 1/2" slices (or larger if
a larger bun is preferred ).Place into greased cake pans. ( I use 3 -
9" pans ) I usually get 19 - 20 buns from this. Let rise until
doubled. Bake at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes, until golden. Do not
overbake. FROST with: 4 oz cream cheese (softened) 1/4 C butter
(softened) 1 1/2 C confectioners sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla 1 1/2 tsp milk

SPREAD on very warm rolls.  They are best when eaten fresh, but we
have found that 10 - 15 seconds in the microwave rejuvenates them!

Note:  I made these in my Hitachi B101 and the dough turned out
beautifully!  I added chopped nuts to the filling though and doubled
the cinnamon.  I also sliced my rolls about 1" and placed them in a
non-stick 13x9" baking pan which rendered about 10 large rolls. Also,
because I don't care for a cream cheese frosting, I used 3 cups
powdered sugar, 4 Tbsp. softened butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and about 3
Tbsp. milk which made lots of frosting, perhaps too much. (Debbie

Cinnamon Apple Swirl Bread (Abm)    No. 3351

breads, abm

1 pkg active dry yeast
2 1/4 cup bread flour
2 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon dry milk powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup water swirl filling:
1  apple, peeled, cored & 1/4 diced
3 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

All ingredients should be at room temperature before starting. Add
all the dough ingredients to the pan in the order listed. Select
"White Bread". Press "Start".

Let the machine run all the way through the end of final kneading.
During the final knead, prepare a work area in which the dough will
be rolled out.

Combine and thoroughly blend the spiral filling ingredients.

After the machine stops kneading for the final time, remove the bread
pan with the dough in it.

PERSONAL NOTE: (this part depends on the machine you are using. -
with my Hitachi if I remove the bread pan the machine automatically
goes back to zero on the timer - what I do is just take the dough out
of the pan and leave the pan in place)

Working quickly, turn the dough out onto a well floured work area.
Roll the dough out to form a long but narrow (about half as wide as
the bread pan is tall) oblong of dough about  1/2" thick. Spread the
spiral filling ingredients over the top of the dough oblong. Roll the
dough up jelly-roll fashion. Return the dough cylinder to the bread
pan. Permit the machine to complete the rise and bake cycles
normally. ~!- Sharon Stevens

Although not an extremely sweet bread, it is very flavorful. The nuts
give it a great crunch, especially if added during the mix cycle.
Follow manufacturers directions.
NOTES:  1.For Panasonic/National Machines, use 3 1/2 tsp. of yeast for
th 1 1/2 lb. loaf.
2.  For DAK/Welbilt machines, use 5 tbsp. of warm water for the 1 1/2
lb. loaf.
3.  For best results, add the raisins and chopped nuts after the first
mixing.  If your machine has a mix cycle, use it and add the raisins and
nuts at the "Mix" beep.

      ----MIX, COOL, & ADD----
1/3 cup corn meal
1 1/2 cup water; boiling

Place cornmeal in bowl and pour boiling water into it, stirring till
smooth.  Let cool 30 minutes.

Pour remaining ingredients into bakery, then add cornmeal mixture.
Set "baking control" at 12 o'clock.  Select "white bread" and push Start.

Sylvia's comments: This loaf came out fine on the white bread cycle, in
spite of all the molasses, and even when I had to substitute pancake syrup
for part of the molasses.  Fine-textured, easy to slice, good sandwich
bread.

Converting Bread Recipes For Breadmaker

abm, breadmachine

1  copyright 1994 s. steiger

1. Calculate the number of "loaves" in a non-ABM recipe by allowing 3
cups of flour per "loaf" (or 2 cups flour for a 1-lb machine).
Rounding off is fine; if a recipe calls for 5 cups flour, I figure
that's close enough to 2 loaves for government work. Remember to add
in ALL the flours, if there's bread flour plus WW flour plus rye
flour plus ... you get the idea. Most handmade bread recipes seem to
make 2 loaves.

2.    Have MM resize it to 1 loaf.

3. Manually change the yeast and sugar amounts to whatever suits your
machine.  In my R2D2, 1/2 tb yeast and 1/2 tb sugar are optimum. (If
you don't know what works best in your machine, don't try altering
recipes yet! Try a number of different ABM recipes and start looking
for a pattern. What amounts give the best results?) If the amount the
resized recipe calls for is dramatically different from what you know
works in your machine, don't worry.  Stick with what works in your
machine. (This does not apply to sweet breads; since my R2D2 doesn't
produce usable sweet breads, I've not tried to convert sweet bread
recipes and have no guidelines to suggest.)

4. Add the dry ingredients and oil/butter/eggs to the machine.
Measure out the liquid and pour in HALF of the measured amount. (If
your machine calls for putting in the liquid first, and you're
terrified to use a different ingredient order, put only HALF the
measured amount of liquid in.) Start the machine and let knead a few
minutes. Add remaining liquid, a little at a time, until the dough is
the right consistency. (Again, if you haven't used your ABM enough to
recognize the right consistency when you see/feel it, don't start
adapting recipes yet.) You may need to add more liquid, or you may
have liquid left over. Make a note of how much liquid you actually
used.

5. When the bread is done, evaluate.  Didn't rise enough? Add another
1/8 cup liquid next time. Overflowed? Reduce the liquid by 1/8 cup. I
don't remember the last time I had to adjust anything except the
liquid.

1/4 cup chopped pecans (opt)

Add ingredients in the order recommended for your bread machine. If
you prefer the cranberries and apples in larger pieces, add at the
raisin beep (if your machine has this), or when the first kneading is
almost completed. Cook the bread on the Sweet cycle or on the Basic
cycle. Fresh or frozen thawed cranberries may be substituted, but
decrease the amount of milk and check the consistency of the dough a
few times during the mixing process and be ready to adjust with a
little more milk or flour.

Currant-Walnut Baguettes

breads

1  karen mintzias
1 pkg yeast
1 1/2 tablespoon honey
1 1/4 cup warm water
1 1/2 cup bread flour
1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup walnut halves
3/4 cup currants
1/4 cup golden raisins
1  butter; for coating bowl
1  egg; beaten, for glaze

This earty brown bread, shaped into long thin baguettes and densely
packed with raisins and walnuts, is virtually impossible to stop
eating. Renee first tasted a similar bread at the two-starred Michel
Rostang in Paris. She likes to serve it with hearty soups, such as
cream of pumpkin or squash, with curried chicken salad or cream
cheese spreads, and, of course, with fruit and cheese.  Bread as good
as this is worth the work.

Directions: =========== Dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4 cup warm
water and let stand until foamy, about
10    minutes.

In a food processor fitted with a plastic dough blade, combine the
flours and salt.  Process about 30 seconds. Add the walnuts and
process an additional 15 seconds. With the machine running, pour the
yeast mixture through the feed tube.

With the machine running, slowly add 1 cup water through feed tube.
Process until the dough clears the sides of the bowl and is no longer
dry, about 1 minute additional.

Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead in the currants and
raisins for about 5 minutes.

Coat a large bowl with butter.  Transfer the dough to the bowl,
turning to coat the top with butter.  Cover with plastic wrap and a
towel and set aside to rise in a warm place, until the dough is
doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board. Punch down to remove
air bubbles and divide the dough into two equal parts. Roll each part
into a 6 x 15-inch sheet. Roll the sheets into long cylinders,
pinching the edges to seal.  Transfer the cylinders, seam side down,
to a buttered baking sheet or two baguette pans. Cover with plastic
wrap and a towel and set aside to rise until the dough is almost
doubled, about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425.

Brush the loaves with the beaten egg and slash each with a sharp knife
several times along the diagonal. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until
loaves are well browned.

Daddy's Dark Pumpernickel Bread

breads

1 1/4 cup bread flour
2 teaspoon brown sugar
3/4 cup rye flour
2/3 teaspoon instant coffee granules
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoon caraway seeds (opt)
1 tablespoon dry milk
1 1/2 tablespoon cocoa powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon molasses, dark
1 tablespoon butter
7 1/2 oz water
3 tablespoon cornmeal
1 teaspoon yeast

Add ingredients to your bread machine in recommended order. In the
Panasonic, add the dry ingredients first, then the liquids. If using
Fleishmans yeast, increase amount!

This will make a 1 lb. loaf. (Tested and created by Robert Birr,
using a composite of the Panasonic manual--some people do read
manuals!--, Donna German's receipe and probably more of his
imagination than he gives himself credit for!)

SOURCE;  More Bread Machine Magic by Linda Rehberg and Lois Conway,
copyright 1997, ISBN #0-312-16935-3. MM format by Ursula R. Taylor.
Note just above the recipe says that this bread was inspired by fond
memories of Linda's Dad sitting at the table pouring milk over his
rice and putting cinnamon & sugar on top. Also notes to watch dough
ball as it varies each time you make it and that if you use freshly
cooked rice you will need to add extra liquid. 1. Place all
ingredients except raisins in bread pan, using the least amount of
liquid listed in the recipe. Select Light Crust setting and
Raisin/Nut cycle. Press start. 2. Observe the dough as it kneads.
After 5 to 10 minutes, if it appears dry & stiff or if your machine
sounds as if it's straining to knead it, add more liquid 1 tbsp. at a
time until dough forms a smooth, soft, pliable ball that is slightly
tacky to the touch. 3.  At the beep, add the raisins. 4. After the
baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack, & allow
to cool 1 hour before slicing. CRUST: Light -- BAKE CYCLE: Raisin/nut
~- OPTIONAL BAKE CYCLES: Standard, Whole Wheat, Sweet Bread..

Dakota Bread

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup honey
1/2 cup warm water (105-115f)
2 1/2 cup bread flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup wheat germ
1/4 cup rye flour
1/4 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cottage cheese
1 large egg
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  oil and cornmeal for pan
1  egg white; frothed with fork  for gl
1  additional wheat germ =or=- oats, f; or top of loaf

STIR YEAST AND HONEY into water; let stand until foamy, about 5
minutes. For food processor fitted with metal blade or mixer with
dough hook, put remaining bread ingredients into bowl. Turn machine
on and combine mixture. With machine running, slowly add yeast
mixture. Mix until dough cleans sides of bowl. If dough is too
sticky, add more flour by the tablespoon, working it in before adding
more. If dough is crumbly and dry, add more water by the teaspoon,
working it in before adding more. Once desired consistency is
reached, (moist but not sticky), mix dough until well kneaded,
uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds in food processor,
about 6 minutes in mixer. Or by hand, put ingredients in large bowl.
Mix well. Make well in center. Pour yeast mixture into well. Work
yeast mixture into ingredients, then knead on floured board until
smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to large plastic
bag, squeeze out air and seal at top. Place dough in bowl. Let rise
in warm spot until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Oil a heat-proof glass
pie plate. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal. Punch dough down and shape
into smooth ball. Place smooth side up in prepared plate. Cover
loosely with oiled plastic. Let rise in warm spot until doubled,
about 1 hour. Fifteen minutes before baking, put rack in center of
oven; set oven at 375F. When loaf has doubled, brush top with egg
white. Sprinkle with wheat germ and(or) rolled oats. Bake until loaf
is deep brown (cover with foil last 5 minutes if too dark) and sounds
hollow when rapped on bottom, about 35 minutes. Place loaf on rack to
cool. Yield: 1 round loaf.

Dak's Sourdough Starter ABM

breads

1 cup nonfat or lowfat milk
3 tablespoon unflavored yogurt (we used
1  nonfat)
1 cup all-purpose flour

In a 1-quart pan over medium heat, heat milk to 90-100 degrees.
Remove from heat and stir in yogurt. Place in a warm 3 to 6 cup
glass, ceramic, plastic or stainless steel container with a tight
lid. Cover and let stand in a warm place until mixture is the
consistency of yogurt and a curd has formed. (You can test the
mixture by tilting the container. If the mixture doesn't flow freely
when the container is tilted, it's ready.)

The curding process takes about 18 to 24 hours. You'll need to check
it periodically. If some clear liquid rises to the top of the milk,
stir it back in. NOTE: If the liquid turns pink, discard the batch
and start again.

Once the curd has formed, add the flour and stir until smooth. Cover
again and let stand in a warm place until the mixture is full of
bubbles and has a good sour smell. This should take about 2 to 5
days. Again, if some clear liquid rises to the top stir it back in.
If the liquid turns pink, discard the batch and start again. When the
mixture is ready, you can keep it covered and store it in the
refrigerator until you need it. The recipe makes about 1 1/3 cup
starter.

Delicatessen Rye

breadmachine, sourdough

2 1/4 teaspoon yeast
2 2/3 cup bread flour ]
1 cup rye flour; plus 2 tbsp
2 1/4 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon caraway seeds
1 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoon barley malt syrup
1/3 cup sourdough starter water; plus 2 tbsp.

This bread really does taste just like deli rye.
Follow your machine's instructions. It's such a good sourdough, you
may have to cut back on the yeast. I made a loaf this morning and cut
the yeast back from 2 tsp. to 1 1/2 tsp. and it still spilled over
the pan.

Dilled Potato Bread Abm

breads

      ----BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----
1/2 tablespoon yeast
3 cup bread flour
3 tablespoon wheat germ
3 tablespoon powdered milk
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 tablespoon dill seed
2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon oil
1  eggs
1 1/4 cup water

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Leftover or just cooked and mashed potatoes give this bread a soft
texture and tangy, almost sourdough taste. The loaf is very good with
pot roast or roast beef, meat loaf, vegetable soups, and chowders.

Dough Enhancer

abm, substitute

1 cup lecithin granules
1 tablespoon vitamin c powder
1 tablespoon ginger, ground

Mix all ingredients and store in tightly closed glass jar.

Add to breadmaker in amount equal to yeast with other dry ingredients.
Start machine.

Apparently, the ginger gooses the yeast and makes it act more swiftly, the
ascorbic acid strengthens the gluten, and the lecithin aids the oil in
causing the strands of gluten to slip against each other more easily and
thus rise better.

THE BREADMACHINE COOKBOOK IV by Donna Rathmell German has a section titled
"Dough Enhancers" and in that section it mentions Lecithin. "Lecithin is a
food supplement which is obtained from oil in egg yolks or soy beans. It
improves moisture and assists in expansion and elasticity of the bread
dough. Add between 1 and 1 1/2 tsp. of lecithin granules per cup of flour."

If you do not have enough STARTER to have 2 Cps for bread recipe,
you can use just one C. STARTER and 2 T. dry yeast.

NOTE:--> The lady who gave this to me, in Anchorage, has the follow
ing notation: I like the taste of the bread made as above, better
than the other. // So much for that. When my starter is ready to use,
I'm going to do the whole thing in my DAK and see what happens..I
might really be roll ing in the dough... All it can do is devour me,

Dr. Benjamin's Rye Bread Starter Abm

breads

2 1/2 teaspoon yeast
2 cup water
2 cup rye flour
1 small onions
1 cup water
1 1/2 cup rye flour

Sprinkle yeast over tepid water.  Beat in flour till no lumps remain.
Peel and halve onion; add to starter. Cover loosely with cloth & let
stand at room temp for
24    hrs.

Remove onion.  Beat in tepid water & flour.  Cover with cloth and let
stand for 24 hrs more.  The starter should now be pleasingly
sour-smelling, almost beery and bubbly.

Feed once a week with 1/2 c tepid water & 3/4 c rye flour and leave
out overnight.  Otherwise keep in fridge. (Good idea to feed the day
before you're going to use it.)

Again, add fruit as for raisin bread. Maybe I liked this bread because I

2 teaspoon active dry yeast
3 cup bread flour
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamon
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

onion and garlic and cook until the onion is softened, 3 to 5 minutes
longer. Let cool.

Panasonic or National), add the still-frozen peas.

Eat warm or cool, cut into wedges instead of slices.

Egg Pasta Dough Abm

pasta, abm

6  eggs
4 1/2 cup flour

Put flour in the pan and crack the eggs into the center of the flour. Start
the machine and check to make sure it isn't working too hard. If so, add a
tablespoon of cold water at a time until it is kneading without trouble.
Remove the dough as soon as the kneading has stopped. Check the dough
before rolling by inserting a finger into the center; if it comes out
almost dry, then it is ready to use.  Take small pieces of dough at a time
and roll it to the thickness of the noddle you want and slice it
lenghtwise.  Flour the noodles and set them aside. You can hang them on a
drying rack.  To cook fresh noodles, bring to a boil 2/3 large pan of
salted water. Add pasta and bring water back to boil, cooking uncovered for
5 to 20 seconds after the water returns to a boil. DO NOT OVERCOOK PASTA!
If your pasta is more than a day old, it requires longer cooking.

Eggnog Bread

breads, holiday, machine

2 tablespoon sugar
1 pkg active dry yeast
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
3/4 cup eggnog; at room temp.*

I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for
the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may
need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with
it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too
dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!
* Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the
microwave) Place ingred. in the B/M according to your manufacturers'
directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as needed This made
a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of my breadmaker. I
used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness or darkness
button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a Welbilt). Let
me know your results, we sure enjoyed it! FROM: LISA CRAWLEY (TSPN00B)

English Muffin Bread

breadmachine, muffins

1 1/4 cup water
2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3 cup bread flour
3 tablespoon nonfat dry milk
2 teaspoon yeast

I've tried this bread several times in my Hitachi
and have been very happy with it.  Don't be alarmed
at the small size of the loaf; the top is supposed
to sink.  The recipe comes from Donna German's 1st
B/M Cookbook.
(This is great to put on the timer to have first
thing in the morning)

English Muffin Bread (For Bread Machines)

breads, breadmachine

1 1/4 cup water
2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3 cup bread flour
3 tablespoon nonfat dry milk
2 teaspoon yeast

Note: Ingredients are for Large Loaf (about 1.5 lbs), adjust # of
servings for Medium or Small loaf.
Put all ingredients in machine in the order suggested by your
machine's manufacturer and fire that bad boy up on the regular bread
cycle. The top of the loaf should come out sunken, this is normal.
The texture and taste is just like English Muffins, this is GREAT for
toasting!

tsp. Bread flour 2 1/4 C. 3 C. Dry milk 2 Tbl. 3 Tbl. Sea Salts 1

Tbl. Honey 1 tsp. 2 tsp. Active dry yeast 2 tsp. 1 pkg. In a small
cup, combine the warm water and baking soda, and set aside for 5
minutes. Fit the kneading blade firmly on the shaft in the bread pan.
Carefully measure the flour, dry milk and salt, transfer to the pan.
Add the Sourdough Starter, water-baking soda mixture, oil, honey, and
yeast. Place in bread pan inside the machine and close the lid.

Five-Grain Soda Bread

breadmachine, diabetic

1 cup all-purpose flour (see note)
3/4 cup whole-wheat flour
3/4 cup rye flour
3/4 cup graham flour
3/4 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon soft margarine or veg. oil
3/4 cup raisins (optional)
1 3/4 cup buttermilk
1  or 1 3/4 tb lemon juice
1  or 1 3/4 tb vinegar
1  plus milk to make 1 3/4 cup

Mix vinegar or lemon juice with milk for sour milk and set aside. If
using powdered skim milk, use almost 2/3 cup powder and enough water
to make 1 1/2 cup milk. Stir, then add lemon juice, then add enough
water to make the 1 3/4 cup measure.

If you do not have all the different kinds of flour, use what you do
have to make 3 1/4 cups, or try 1/4 cup wheat germ or bran plus 3 cups
all-purpose flour. Make a note of the ingredients and a note of the
result.

Sugar could possibly be left out, especially if 2 tbsp. or more of
raisins (or finely chopped dates) are used.

Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.  Cut in margarine or oil. Stir in
raisins (if using) and add buttermilk or sour milk to make a soft
dough.

Knead lightly on a floured surface until smooth. Place on a greased
baking sheet and flatten into a circle about 2 1/2 inches thick. Cut
large X about 1/4 inch deep on top.  OR make 2 smaller loaves.

Bake at 350 F for about 1 hour or until toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean.

Flour Measuring Hint

1  diana lewis vgwn37a

All flour is presifted but it settles during shipment. A cup of flour
scooped directly from the bag can weigh up to 5 ounces. It SHOULD
weigh 4 ounces. To measure correctly fluff up flour in the bag or
canister. Then sprinkle it lightly with a spopon into a measuring
cup, scrape the excess off the top with a knife. From King Arthur

Fluffy Popcorn Bread

breadmachine

1 1/2 cup water
2 1/2 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon vital gluten
1 cup milled popped popcorn
3 cup bread flour
2 teaspoon yeast

Pop popcorn. 1/2 cup popcorn yields 8 cups. Mill the popped popcorn.
8 cups of popped popcorn will yield 4 cups of fluffy popcorn flour.
Put ingredients in breadpan in order given. Set for rapid bake. The
resulting loaf is high and light--the texture almost of "Wonder
Bread" but much more flavorful. I milled the popcorn in my electic
Miracle Mill but the hand mills should work fine,too. Popcorn must be
compressed a bit as it's entering the mill and a wooden lemon reamer
works well as a "stuffer". Do NOT attempt to mill unpopped popcorn in
your electric mill. I can only break those hard kernels with my Back
to Basics hand mill. The extra popcorn flour can be frozen in a
ziploc and stored for future loaves. The fragrance is wonderful!

Four Herb Bread

breadmachine

2 teaspoon yeast
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon powdered buttermilk
3 cup better for bread flour (it does mak; e a diff.)
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon majoram; (dried crumbled leaves)
1 teaspoon basil; (dried crumbled leaves)
1/2 teaspoon thyme; (ground)
2 teaspoon dill weed; (dried)
2 tablespoon butter; softened warm water.

This recipe works well in the large size loaf machines. I have a Dak
R2D2 machine. If you don't have the herbs called for, you can
substitute whatever herbs you like. Put all the ingredients in, in
the order listed (if using a dak), or in the order your machine
likes. Select the white bread setting and a medium crust setting.
Depending on your climate you may need to add a TBS more of water. I
usually use Gluten, but when I first made this WITH gluten it
exploded over the top of the pan and onto the dome. So I dont put
gluten in the recipe. I think it has something to do with the B for B
flour. I seem to use less gluten in the breads when I am using that
flour. Formatted by Elaine Radis

Freezing Dough

breadmachine

1  see below

I make brown and serve rolls all the time just let rise and bake 20
minutes at 250 DO NOT brown rolls let cool they will be slightly
tacky on top take out of pan let cool compeletly on a rack they will
keep up to 7 days in the fridge and 3 months in the freezer. wrap in
foil put in plastic bag. to bake let thaw at room temp then bake for
8 minutes at 350 till golden brown. This is a great way to make stuuf
ahead when having Easter, Thanksgiving or Christmas or any other
large dinner. I made cinnamon rolls the other day and just let the
machine (DAK TurboII) do the manual cycle and when done I rolled them
out and sliced them as usual and put them into 9" pie pans. I froze
them without letting them rise any further. Before I went to bed one
night I took a pan out of the freezer and put on the counter. When I
got up the next morning I popped them in the oven. They were just as
good as if I had done it the normal way. I would think dinner rolls
would work the same if you had time to let them thaw. The other reply
about making them into "brown and serve" rolls sounds good, too.

Fresh Rosemary Onion Focaccia ABM

breads

1 1/4 cup water
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup rosemary leaves
2 teaspoon salt
3 cup flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1 tablespoon yeast
1 large spanish onions; cooked in
2 tablespoon olive oil
      ----TOPPING----
2 tablespoon olive oil
1  coarse salt
1  ground pepper

Place all dough ingredients except cooked onion in the machine,
program for knead and first rise. Press start. Strain onions and
return liquid. At end of final knead, add the onion (without liquid)
to the machine. Restart and knead only until the onion is roughly
mixed in. The dough will be wet and onion will remain in clumps,
sticking out of the dough. Turn the dough out on a well-floured board
and knead briefly by hand to form a ball. Oil a pizza pan or baking
sheet. Place the dough on the prepared pan and pat into a 12" disk.
Coat the top of the dough with the onion juices. Cover with plastic
wrap and let it rise either at room temperature until doubled in
bulk, or in the refrigerator overnight.  A long cold rise in the
refrigerator will result in a more flavorful bread with a heartier
interior. Preheat the oven to 450øF. with the rack in the center
position.

Just before baking the dough, use your fingertips to gently make
indentations in the surface. Drizzle on the oil and then sprinkle
with salt and pepper. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce to oven to
350øF. and bake for another 12 to 15 minutes, or until the focaccia
is golden brown. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Garlic And Herb Bread Pinwheels

appetizers, abm, yeast bread, snacks, guest

      ----DOUGH----
3 cup bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon yeast
2 tablespoon basil oil
2  garlic cloves; pressed (or more, up to 4
1  egg
1 cup water, warm
      ----FILLING----
8 oz spinach, cooked; drained & pureed
2 tablespoon fresh basil; minced
2 tablespoon fresh parsley; minced
2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves; minced
1  freshly ground pepper
      ----TOPPING----
1  egg; beaten
2 tablespoon milk
1/2 cup parmesan cheese; grated

Bread:  Make dough using 'manual' or 'dough' cycle on machine, according to
manufacturer's directions.

Forming:  Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle
approximately 9 x 12".  Brush the dough with 2 tb. of the Basil Oil,
leaving a border along one of the long edges.  Spread the spinach over the
oiled survace, leaving the border clear.  Sprinkle on the basil, parsley,
thyme and pepper.  Lightly moisten the clear edges of the dough with a
little water, and starting at the opposite edge, roll up the dough to form
a jelly roll.  Pinch ends together to seal.  Brush all over with the
remaining Basil Oil.  Cut into 14 equal slices.  Either use a very sharp
knife or a piece of string:  slide under roll of dough, cross ends, and
pull on ends to slice.

Arrange slices, cut-side up, in a pan that has been sprayed with pan
coating.  Cover and leave in a warm place until well risen, 1-2 hours.

Preheat oven to 425 F.  In a small bowl combine the remaining egg with the
milk to make an egg wash.  Brush onto the dough.  Sprinkle with the cheese.
Bake until golden, 20-25 minutes.  Cool slightly before turning out.

Serve with salads or as an appetizer.

Gf Gene's Basic Rice Bread

breads

1 cup fresh gluten-free buttermilk
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon rice vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup brown rice flour
1/3 cup potato starch flour
1/3 cup tapioca flour
1/4 cup sugar
3 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
3  eggs
1/2 cup water (welbilt/dak & z +2 tb
1 1/2 tablespoon active dry yeast

Gene Hill, who lives in Davis, California, bakes this bread at least
twice a week.  He recommends trying it as a toasted cheese sandwich.
Grill it with thin slices of red onion or bell pepper and cheese.

1.  Place the buttermilk, melted butter, rice vinegar, and salt in
bread pan.  Stir with a rubber spatula.

2.  In a large bowl, combine all the dry ingredients except the
yeast. Mix well with a whisk.

3.  In a separate bowl, combine the eggs and water; beat lightly.

4.  Place 1/2 of the dry ingredients in the bread pan. Add the egg
mixture. Add the remainder of the dry ingredients; sprinkle the yeast
on top. Select Light Crust setting and press Start.

5.  Observe the dough frequently during the kneading cycles. If it
does not appear to be mixing well, use a rubber spatula to assist it
occasionally.

6.  After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on wire
rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

VARIATIONS * You can substitute olive oil for the butter. * Replace
1/4 to 1/2 cup of the rice flour with another gluten-free flour, such
as yellow or blue corn flour, polenta meal, or soy flour. * You can
add at least 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese for a new flavor. * Saute
some onions in the melted butter, allow them to cool, then add them
and your favorite herbs to create an onion/herb bread.

Gluten Free Bread Hints - Bread Machine

abm, hints

1 x no ingredients

From - Bread Machine Baking for Better Health, Maureen Keane and
Danirlla Chase. ~---- Personal Note: I have not tried any of these
recipes, but for anyone that is on a restricted diet I would
recommend that you take a look at this book. I found it at our local
health food store. ~----

Check your machine's instruction booklet to make sure your machine
can bake whole grain breads.  Some machines on the market today are
equipped to make only lighter, white breads. If you bake whole grain
breads in this type of machine you will eventually wear down the
motor. Baking Gluten Free Bread in ABM

Since only flours containing no lkiadin and prolamin can be used to
make bread for people with celiac disease or dermatitis
herpetiformis, a substitute for gluten must be used to make the dough
rise. An excellent substitute for gluten is xanthan gum, a natural
product made from Xanthomomas campestis.  This micro organism is
grown in the lab for its cell coat, which is dried and ground to form
xanthan gum. Xantham gum is added as a powder to the dry bread
ingredients. One teaspoon is needed for every cup of gluten free
flour. You can buy this product at your local health food store or
order it from various mail order companies.

Tips for Making Gluten Free Breads

1.  Buy a machine that makes the 1 1/2 pound square type loaf. This
will enable you to make medium and small size loaves that are easy to
slice for sandwiches and toast.

2.  Gluten free doughs are sticky and difficult to mix. Help your
machine by checking on the dough often during the first 5 - 10
minutes. Scrape down the sides of the pan with a soft rubber spatula.

3.  Gluten free dough does not look like ordinary wheat dough. Gluten
free doughs require more liquid and in some recipes resemble a batter
more than a dough. By observing the dough mixing during the first 5 ~
10 minutes you will get a feel for what the dough should look like
and be able to adjust the liquid and dry ingredients accordingly.

4.  The dough will mix more readily if you always add the liquid
ingredients first.  Do this EVEN if your machine recommends that dry
ingredients should go in first.

5.  GF breads require extra yeast to rise.  Some recipes will double
or triple the amount of yeast called for in a similar recipe made
with wheat flour.

6. If your machine has a yeast dispenser, do NOT use it. The bread
will rise higher if you sprinkle the yeast on top of the dry
ingredients just before you start the machine.

7.  A combination of three or four flours will taste better than a
mixture of just one or two flours.  The bread will rise higher as
well.

8.  Never buy your flours from an open bin.  They may be contaminated
with small amounts of gluten containing products. Use only products
that are sealed in a package.

9.  Wheat free ingredients are not the same as gluten free products.

10.  Potato starch flour is not the same as potato flour. Potato
flour is heavier and does not work well in gluten free breads.

Lactose intolerance:

Cereal free soymilk makes an excellent substitute for milk. Fortified
soymilk will also add significant amounts of protein, calcium,
vitamin D and ribroflavin to your breads:

Gluten Free Steamed Apricot Bread

breads

3/4 cup rolled oats
2/3 cup brown rice flour
1/4 cup amaranth flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup almonds
3/4 cup boiling water
1/3 cup molasses or honey
1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract
1/2 cup dried apricots

In a large bowl, combine the oats, rice flour, amaranth flour and
baking soda. Grind the almonds to a fine powder in a blender.
Gradually add enough water to bring the level up to 1 cup. With the
machine running, add the molasses or honey and almond extract. Add
the apricots and process with a few on/off turns to chop them; do not
puree. Pour the liquid mixture into the flour bowl. Stir to mix. Turn
out into an oiled 1 qt. mold or 1 lb can. Cover with a square of wax
paper or foil (shiny side down); tie wax paper securely with a piece
of string. Place the mold on a wire rack in a Dutch oven or large
stockpot.  Add enough boiling wate to the pot to come halfway up the
sides of the mold. Cover the pot tightly, and steam the bread over
med-low heat for 2 hours Do not remove the cover during the cooking
time. Remove the mold from the pot. Cool the bread in the mold for 15
min, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. For best
results, slice with a serrated knife. Variations: Replace the rice
flour with 1/3 c rice polish and 1/3 c rice bran. You can also
replace the amaranth flour with either 1/4 c soy flour, 1/4 c white
buckwheat flour or 1/4 c ground sunflower seeds.

Gluten-Free Mock Rye Bread (For Bread Machine

breads, breadmachine, gluten free

1 1/2 cup brown rice flour
1/2 cup rice bran
1/2 cup tapioca flour
1/2 cup potato starch flour
1 tablespoon xanthan (or guar) gum
1 tablespoon caraway seeds
1/2 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon grated orange peel
2 teaspoon yeast
2  eggs
3 tablespoon oil
1 tablespoon fruit sweet
2 tablespoon molasses
1 1/2 cup water
2 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon vinegar

Follow directions for your particular bread machine. Use single rise
setting.

I wrap the bread in a towel for about 4 hours after it is done baking
and then slice it thinly with an electric knife. It freezes well. I
take individual slices of bread out the the freezer and then
microwave about 30 seconds per slice.

This bread is wonderful!  Many of my non-celiac guests request this
over homemade whole wheat bread.

Golden Potato Rolls

vegetables, breadmachine, diabetic

1 pkg active dry yeast (1/4 oz.)
1/2 cup warm water (110-115 degrees f.)
1 cup milk
3/4 cup shortening or margarine
1 1/4 cup leftover mashed potatoes
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoon salt
8 cup to 8 1/2 c a-p flour, divided
2  eggs, beaten

Dissolve yeast in water; set aside. In a saucepan, combine milk,
shortening, and potatoes; cook and stir over low heat just until
shortening is melted. Remove from the heat and place in a large bowl
with sugar, salt, 2 cups of flour and the yeast mixture. Add eggs;
mix well. Cover loosely and allow to stand for 2 hours (the dough
will be like a sponge). Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth
and elastic, about 6 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once
to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled,
about 1 hour. Punch down and divide into thirds. On a floured surface
roll each portion into a 12 inch circle. Cut each circle into 12 pie
shape wedges. Beginning at the wide end, roll up each wedge. Place
rolls, point side down, on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise
30 minutes or until nearly doubled. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 15
minutes or until golden. Yield: 3 dozen.

Gooey Cheese Bread ABM

breads

3/4 cup water
2  eggs
1/4  unsalted butter
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cup flour
2 teaspoon yeast
      ----FILLING----
3 cup swiss cheese; shredded

Place all dough ingredients in pan and program for knead only.  Press
start. The dough will be slightly sticky.  After the kneading cycle,
transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic
wrap, and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight, or as long as 24
hours. Grease and flour a 9" cake pan. Preheat the oven to 375øF.
with the rack in the center position.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly
floured work surface. Roll the dough to a 14 x 10 rectangle with the
long side nearest you. Sprinkle 2 cups of the cheese over the surface
of the dough. Starting with the edge closest to you, roll the dough
up like a jelly roll. Press the edges together and turn it over so
the seam is now facing down. With the seam still down, roll the
cylinder around itself in a coil and transfer it to the prepared pan.
Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top of the loaf and allow to
rise, uncovered for 20 minutes. Bake for 35 minutes at 375øF., then
turn the oven down to 350øF. and bake for 10 more minutes. If the
cheese begins to brown quickly during the first 35 minutes, turn the
oven down sooner.

Graham Bread (Abm)

breads

2 1/2 cup white flour
1 pkg yeast
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ginger
1 cup milk
3/4 cup water
1/4 cup molasses
3 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon salt
3 cup graham flour

In large bowl stir together white flour, yeast, cinnamon and ginger.
In saucepan combine milk, water, molasses, butter and salt. Heat to
115 to 120 degrees, and butter is almost melted.  Add to flour
mixture, beat on low speed of electric mixer 1/2 minute, scraping
sides of bowl constantly. eat three minutes on high, stir in graham
flour. Stir in as much remaining flour as you can stir in with a
spoon. Turn out onto floured surface. Knead in enough white flour to
make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic, (8 to 10
minutes). You can use a bread machine for this, or personally I now
use a Kitchenaid mixer with dough hook (since my two bread machines
died). Shape into a ball, place in greased bowl, turn over once to
coat.  Cover, let rise until double, about 1 hour. Punch down, divide
dough in half.  cover let rest 10 minutes. Shape into two loaves,
whatever shape you want, and place in bread pans, pie pans for round
loaves, or free form on a cookie sheet. Cover, let rise until double,
about 30 minutes. Bake 375 25 - 30 minutes. Cool before slicing. This
is one of the best breads I have ever tasted.

over dough. Starting with shorter side, roll up tightly. Pinch edge
to seal. Cut into 12 slices.  Place on greased 13"x9" pan. Or cut 9
slices, throw away the two end pieces and place in 9" round pan, with
one in the middle and the rest arranged around the outside. (looks
real nice) Cover; let rise in a warm place until almost double in
volume, (about 30 minutes).

1/4 cup sugar
6 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon powdered buttermilk
7/8 cup water
2 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoon quick rising yeast.
1 1/2 teaspoon cardomon; + -

Make on dough cycle. There are several ways to make these one is to
cut into 12 to 15 equal pieces then roll each into a rope about 6 to
8 inches long tie in a knot and pinch ends together and place pinched
end side down in a lightly greased pan. Let rise till doubled about

balls then place three balls into a muffin tin. Let rise as
previously stated. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 13 to 15
minutes till tops are a golden brown. For the sticky part after
removal of rolls from oven brush on a mixture of melted butter about
1 TBL and 1 Tbl sugar heated in a sauce pan till sugar is slightly
dissolved let mixture cool some and brush on rolls. These rolls are
just as good without. They also reheat real well. If you would like
to make brown and serve rolls bake rolls at 250 for 20 to 30 minutes.
DO NOT BROWN. Let them cool completely before storing (DO NOT put on
the glaze) tops of rolls will be slightly tacky will last 5 to 7 days
in fridge and a month in freezer to bake brown and serve preheat oven

1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup golden raisins
1/4 cup walnuts, chopped

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Combine the sugar, cardamom,
salt, egg, milk and oil in a large bowl. Mix well. Add the yeast
mixture, flours, raisins and nuts. Mix well. Add enough extra flour
to make soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and
knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Shape into a round
loaf. Put the dough into a lightly-oiled 8-inch-round cake pan. Cover
with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
about 1 hour. Bake in a 350-degree oven 35 to 40 minutes, or until
brown.

lamb kabobs. SUCCESS HINTS: Cucumber should be peeled, seeded, and

Greek Style Pizzettes ABM

breads, main dish, italian

1 cup water
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 teaspoon lemon rind; grated
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon salt
2 3/4 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon yeast
      ----TOPPING----
1/4  unsalted butter
1/4 lb spinach leaves; rinsed and dried
14  kalamata olives; pitted
1/2 cup feta cheese; crumbled
2 tablespoon parsley; chopped
1  salt
1  pepper
3 tablespoon olive oil

Place all dough ingredients in machine and program for knead and first
rise. Press start. After the first 5 minutes of kneading the dough
will be firm and pull away from the sides of the machine.  While the
dough is rising you can prepare the toppings. In a saute pan, heat
the butter over low heat and cook the spinach long enough for it to
wilt, about 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
garlic. Set the mixture aside while you assemble the pizzettes.

Preheat the oven to 425øF. with the rack in the center position.
Lightly flour 2 baking sheets and set them aside. When the dough is
completed, transfer to a lightly floured surface, cover it with a
clean towel and let it rest for 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 4
even pieces and roll each piece out to a 6" circle. Transfer the
circles to the prepared baking sheet. Distribute the spinach over the
circles followed by the olives and feta cheese. Sprinkle on the
chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil
over the top of each. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the crust is deep
golden brown and the top is starting to brown.

Ham-And-Cheese Bread

breads

1  1 1/2 pound loaf (1 pound)
2 teaspoon active dry yeast (1 1/2 ts)
3 1/2 teaspoon sugar (2 1/2 ts)
1/4 cup chopped ham pieces (3 tb)
1/2 cup grated swiss cheese (1/4 c)
2 1/2 tablespoon dehydrated minced onion 5 ts
3/4 cup grated cheddar cheese (1/2 c
1 1/2 teaspoon paprika (1 ts)
2 1/2 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese 5 ts
1 teaspoon dry mustard (1/2 ts)
1/2 teaspoon salt (1/4 ts)
2 1/2 cup bread flour (1 3/4 c)
2 1/2 tablespoon butter (5 ts)
7 oz warm milk (4 1/2 oz)

NOTES: For Panasonic/National machines, use 3 tsp yeast for the 1 1/2
pound loaf. This bread has a high liquid content, so the top may fall
during baking. Use a light crust setting. The crust will be somewhat
darker than usual, due to the fresh cheese in the recipe.

Harvest Round Bread (Breadmaker)

breads, breadmachine

1 tablespoon molasses
1 pkg yeast
1 cup white flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup carrots
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup raisins water
1/4 cup nuts
3/16 cup margarine

NOTE: This recipe was resized; follow the directions for your B/M.
Because I am still so new at this *P BB I wrote my note in the wrong
place so here goes again!  My bread making is improving, thanks to *P
and B M Magic! I love the book. On a trip to New England I bought
bread in a town square, it was wonderful! Later I wrote the baker for
the recipe and she kindly sent it.  I've only tried it once (I'm new
to bread making). But now I'd like to try it in my BM.        (the
directions follow for assembling ingredients, etc. but since I want
to make it in my BM, I'm not including them.
Divide dough in two.  Divide each half into 3 and make 3 ropes.
Braid them and make into a circle. Attach both ends,repeat with other
half.

The bread was delicious and I would appreciate any help someone can
give me.  Until later, Renee N.C. San Diego

Hearty Oatmeal Bread

breadmachine, diabetic

5 1/4 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup flour (use as needed)
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup margarine or butter
1/4 cup sugar
2  envelopes active dry yeast
1  or
2 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 cup quick cooking oats
1 tablespoon caraway seeds

The number of slices used to calculate the recipe was not given or
checked. Guessed about 16 half-inch slices per loaf to make 32
servings.

Stir together 2 cups of flour and the salt in a large bowl. Heat the
milk, margarine and sugar together over low heat until the margarine
is soft. Add the liquid to the flour. Beat for 2 minutes on the
medium speed of an electric mixer or 300 strokes by hand.

Combine 1 cup of flour and the yeast.  Add to the batter. Beat for 2
minutes on medium speed or 300 strokes by hand. Stir in the oats and
caraway with a wooden spoon. Stir in enough additional flour to make a
stiff dough.

Turn out onto a floured board.  Knead until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes.
Place in a greased large bowl.  Brush the top with vegetable oil.
Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until
double in size, about 1 hour.

Punch the dough down.  Divide it in half and shape to form two loaves.
Place in two greased 8 1/2 " x 4 1/2 " loaf pans. Brush with melted
margarine or butter. Cover and let rise until nearly double in size,
about 1 hour.  When almost doubled, preheat the oven to 375 F. Bake
for about 40 minutes or until brown.  Cool before slicing. Makes 2
loaves.

Herb Pizza Dough

breads, ethnic

1 pkg active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
7/8 cup warm water, @110 degrees
1/4 cup chopped herbs, optional *
2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon garlic olive oil, more as needed  *; *
1  oil and cornmeal for pan

Stir together the yeast, sugar and warm water.  Let stand until foamy,
about 10 minutes.

In the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade,
chop the herbs.  Turn off machine.  Add flour and salt. Turn the
machine on and off a couple of times. While the machine is running,
add yeast. Process until the dough forms a ball at the side of the
bowl. Add garlic, olive oil and process for 30 to
40    seconds more.

Transfer dough to a bowl that has been oiled with olive oil. Turn the
dough until the entire surface has been coated with the oil. Cover
bowl with a damp towel and allow to rise in a warm draft free place
for 1 hour or until doubled.

Roll out on a lightly floured surface and if dough is too elastic, try
tossing it from hand to hand to flatten it out. Lightly grease the
pizza pan with a little oil and sprinkle with cornmeal. Place the
dough on the pizza pan and trim the edges.  Bake for 10 minutes @425
degrees. Remove from oven, lightly brush the crust with a little more
oil and proceed with recipe.

Makes enough dough for one 12" crust.

* Try basil, thyme, Italian flat leaf parsley, oregano, rosemary,
cilantro.

Herman Wheat'n'honey Starter

breads, breadmachine

1/2 cup honey; or brown sugar
1/3 cup warm water
2 tablespoon yeast
2 cup milk
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup white flour; or unbleached
1 tablespoon ginger
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup white flour; or unbleached
1/4 cup honey; or brown sugar 1/4 t

Stir well. Keep in refrigerator. Sprinkle ginger and 1 T. honey or
brown sugar over warm water. Sprinkle yeast over this and stir. Let
stand in warm place to double in size, about 10 minutes. Mix milk,
rest of honey or brown sugar, flours & yeast mixture in a glass
container, about the size of a gallon Pyrex jar. Stir, using only a
wooden spoon, since metal objects will retard Herman's growth. Leave
the cover on loosely or place a glass plate over the top of the
container so Herman can breathe. Herman doubles, even triples at time
of vigorous rising. Place Herman in a warm place overnight. Next day
refrigerate, loosely covered, and stir each day. This is very
important with Wheat'n'Honey Herman Starter as more gases form in the
container and are released during stirring. Formation of this gas may
cause the starter to appear darker on top before stirring each day,
but this is OK. On the 5th day measure out 1 c. Herman for baking and
another cup to give to a friend, if you wish, then feed the Herman
you have left, thusly: SEE ABOVE From day 5 on you may bake with
Herman any day you wish, always making sure you have one full cup
left for feeding. Feed Herman every five days. If you have a lot
left, feed him only 1 T. honey or brown sugar. If you have one cup or
a little more left, add the same ingredients as you did on the 5th
day.

High Protein Diet/Cornell Bread

breadmachine

      ----MEDIUM LOAF----
1 1/3 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 teaspoon honey salt
8 teaspoon wheat germ
1/3 cup soy flour
1 1/3 cup whole wheat flour
1 2/3 cup bread flour
1/3 cup nonfat dry milk
2 teaspoon yeast

Much better than the store bought diet breads which use "sawdust
fiber" as filler.  This is a tasty, dense loaf. Makes good
sandwiches. The recipe is based on a formula devised for superior
nutrition in bread by faculty at Cornell University.  Wheat germ, soy
flour and nonfat dry milk are added to each cup of flour in the
Cornell Formula, this recipe makes it easier.

Honey White Bread For Bread Machines

breads, breadmachine

1 1/4 cup milk
3 tablespoon butter, unsalted
2 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
3 cup bread flour
3/4 teaspoon salt

Scald the milk. Remove from the heat and add in the butter and honey.
Stir until the butter melts. Let cool to room temperature. Add the
milk mixture and all remaining ingredients in the order suggested by
your bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle
according to the manufacturer's directions. The bread is good warm,
cool, or toasted. It stales faster than store-brought white bread, so
wrap the loaf well and use quickly or freeze. Makes 1-1/2 pound loaf.

Honey-Bran Bread

breads

1 1/2 cup milk
1/2  stick unsalted butter (4tb.)
1/3 cup honey
4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup warm (110 f.) water
2 teaspoon sugar
2 pkg dry yeast
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup unprocessed coarse bran
4 cup white flour (more if needed)

In saucepan, combine milk, butter, honey and salt and stir over med.
heat until butter melts.  Remove from heat and let cool to warm.
Meantime, in lge. mixing bowl, combine warm water, yeast and sugar.
Let "work" until foamy, abt. 10 min.  Beat cooled milk mixture into
yeast mixture, then beat in whole wheat flour and bran; beat
thoroughly. Gradually add all-purpose flour until mixture is too
stiff to beat.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead in remaining
flour or as much as needed until dough is smooth and has a light
sheen.

Note Well:  Properly kneaded dough will NOT stick to surface or hands
or mixing bowl if using machine fitted with dough hook.

Form dough into ball and place in large lightly oiled or greased
bowl, and turn once so greased side is up. Cover, place in warm,
draft-free place & let rise until doubled in bulk, abt. 1 hr. Punch
down, and turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead
lightly--just enough to expell any remaining air. Halve dough, cover
with towell, let rest abt. 10 min.

Form each half of dough into a loaf.  To make pan loaf, roll dough
into rectangle 1/2" thick and abt. as wide as length of pan. Roll up
jelly roll fashion pinching closed seam as you roll. Tuck ends under
and place loaf seam side down in greased loaf pan.  Let rise again
until doubled in bulk. Place loaves in center of preheated 425 F.
oven and bake for 15 min. Reduce oven to 350 and continue baking
until loaves shrink slightly from sides of pan, abt. 20 min. or so.
Turn loaves from pan, set on oven shelf an bake 5 min. more or until
a firm rapping on bottom makes hollow sound. Brush tops with melted
butter and cool on racks.

Hot Chile Pepper Twists ABM

breads

1 cup water; plus
2 tablespoon water; (if needed)
2 tablespoon oil
1/3 cup cilantro leaves; lightly packed
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cornmeal
2 1/4 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon yeast
      ----FILLING----
16 oz black or refried beans
16 oz black olives; drained
4 1/2 oz green chiles; chopped
1/2 cup salsa
8 oz monterey jack cheese; shredded

Place all dough ingredients except cilantro in pan.  Program for
knead and first rise. Program a kitchen timer to go off 10 minutes
before the end of the machine's second kneading cycle.  Check the
dough when timer goes off and adjust with flour or water if needed.
Add the cilantro. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling.
When dough is finished transfer to lightly greased work surface.

Divide the dough in half.  Working with one half at a time, roll it
into a 15 x 10" rectangle.  Transfer the rectangle to a lightly
greased cookie sheet.  Visually divide the rectangle into thirds,
each 10 x 5". Working on the middle third of the dough, and leaving
1" of space at each end, layer on half the beans, half the olives,
half the chilies, half the salsa and then half the cheese.

Using a rolling pizza wheel or a sharp knife, make 6 evenly space 5"
long cuts in the dough, cutting from the edge of one side of the
unfilled sides just to where the filling starts. Repeat with the
other unfilled side. Fold the small piece of dough at each end of the
filling, tucking them underneath the dough on the opposite side.
Repeat the entire process with the other piece of dough. Tent the
twists with lightly greased plastic wrap and set them aside to rise
for 1 hour, or until they're noticeably puffy. Bake the twists in a
preheated 375øF oven for 30 minutes. Remove the twists from the oven,
transfer them to a wire rack, and allow them to cool for 10 minutes
before cutting.

How To Use A Breadmaker

breadmachine, info

1  judy garnett pjxg05a

1. Try using Rapid Rise yeast and check the date on it when you buy
it. Keep it in the refrigerator and always BRING IT TO ROOM
TEMP.BEFORE USING IT. I have been using bulk yeast lately because
it's more economical. I use 2 1/2 level tsp.of the bulk yeast in lieu
of a pkg of yeast. (This is for the 3 Cup DAK).

2.Use BREAD flour instead of all- purpose flour. It has more gluten.
If you are using "darker" flours such as rye, whole wheat etc., use
at least 1 c. white BREAD flour along with the other flours, and try
using 1 tsp. vital wheat gluten for each cup of flour called for in
the recipe. At times, I also use a 1 tsp. lecitihin for each cup of
flour. It helps the elasticity and rise of the bread. If you can't
find either product, call all your local health food stores. Drug
Stores often have lecithin near the vitamins.
3.Check to see that all liquid ingreds. are not too hot or cold.--95
to 110 degrees is about right. I use a very unscientific method for
the warm water and milk. I run hot water from the tap and give it the
"bath water for baby" test on the wrist. <G> Have your other ingreds.
such as eggs and butter at ROOM temp. If the ingreds. are too hot or
cold it may kill the yeast.
4. The key to using the auto- breadmaker is to have the correct
proportion of flour to liquid. After the dough has kneaded for a few
minutes in the breadmaker, look in and see if there is ONE ball of
dough which is incorporating most of the flour from the sides of the
pan. While it's in its first knead (BEFORE it goes into the
fermentation and touch the dough lightly. It should be in one soft
ball. If your finger has sticky dough on it, add a Tablespoon of
flour. Let it knead a minute and touch it again and check to see if
it's still sticky. Keep adding a tablespoon at a time ONLY

until it's no longer sticky, DON'T OVERDO IT. It should be a nice
"soft" ball. If it just makes a slight indentation and doesn't look
crusty, it's probably about right. If it feels too dry or is in two
or more balls, OR if the BM seems to be laboring or is "walking", add
a tablespoon at a time of WARM water. PLEASE DON'T ADD TOO MUCH
LIQUID. If you add too much liquid in proportion to the flour, the
dough may rise too much and overflow. (Your bread won't be done in
the center either) 5.If you look in and see that the dough is
threatening to rise up over the top of the bread pan, don't panic,
poke it a few times with a toothpick, skewer, fork,etc. until it
deflates. 05/31 12:54 pm LOREL

Irish Barmbrack Bread

breads

      ----1 1/2 LB LOAF----
1 1/8 cup water
3 cup bread flour
3 teaspoon gluten
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon dried lemon peel
3/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1 1/2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon dry milk
2 teaspoon red star active dry yeast
3/4 cup raisins

Put all ingredients in bread pan in order of manufacturer directions.

This makes a dense medium size loaf (6-7 inches tall). For a fluffier
taller loaf, increase yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons.

Have ingredients at room temperature.  If necessary, warm water and
butter in microwave for 50-60 seconds on high.

For my Hitachi 101 add 1/4 cup raisins 4 minutes into first cycle. Add
remaining raisins just after resting period and as second kneading
begins.

Crust color: medium Bread Cycle: Bread or Mix Bread

This has been a successful loaf in my Hitachi B101. Other makes of
bread machines will have to make some changes according to their own
machines.

According to a close Irish friend, this does taste and look like the
bread that she grew up with in Ireland.

Note just above recipe says this is light as angel food cake but
doesn't have all the sugar and is a good ending to any Italian
dinner. Slice it thin and use as a basis for strawberry shortcake if
you want or serve it plain alongside some fruit and cheeses.

bread.

Italian Bread 1

breadmachine, italian, fatfree

2/3 cup water
3/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 teaspoon sugar
2 cup bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast

Recipe by: rec.food.cooking You didn't mention the size of your
breadmaker, so I'm going to figure it's the 1lb loaf (I have a
panasonic). Anyway, I've used this recipe at least a dozen times and
I've never had a failure. I USE ONLY PILSBURY BREAD FLOUR . . . and
it has nothing to do with the fact my father and brother work for the
company. Here goes:

Ialways put water in first and then add the dry ingredients with the
yeast on top.  I use the NORMAL setting (3.5 hours) on mine.

3/4 cup golden raisins
3/4 cup milk
4 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon honey
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup cornmeal
2 cup bread flour

1 cup golden raisins
1 cup milk
5 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup honey

2 1/2 teaspoon yeast

SOURCE:  The Bread Machine Cookbook by Melissa Clark, copyright 1993,
ISBN #0-425-13733-3.  Formatted into MM by Ursula R. Taylor.
The recipe for this sweet bread was adapted from my favorite cookie
recipe.  I adore the combination of the chewy, Marsala-flattened raisins
against the sandy texture of cornmeal. To quote one of my more eloquent
tasters, this loaf is "eminently manductable".  It also is a
much-appreciated dish. (This note was just above the bread recipe in the
book.)
Soak the raisins in the Marsala for at least thirty minutes. When the
raisins have absorbed a good deal of the liquid, add whtever Marsala is
left to the bread pan. Reserve the raisins for later.
Place the rest of the ingredients into the pan, and bake according to
manufacturer's instructions.  Add the raisins during the raisin-bread
cycle, or five minutes before the final kneading is finished.

Janice's Sweet Rolls For ABM

breads, abm, birr

4 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon shortening
8 tablespoon dry milk powder
1 medium egg--slightly beaten
1/2 cup sugar
12 oz water
2 1/2 teaspoon yeast--active dry *

Add to the breadmachine in order preferred by your machine. (In mine, start
with the flour and add dry ingredients first). Yeast should be placed in
the yeast dispenser. **note! If you use Fleishmans yeast, increase the
amount by 1 teaspoonful!
Run this on your dough cycle. After completion they can be finished one
of several ways. One is to take a pinch of dough about the size of a small
egg, pull, dip in melted butter, run through sugar/cinnamon mixture and
then tie them in a knot. Another method is to roll out to about the size of
a cookie sheet, spread butter (slightly LESS than a stick) over surface,
then top with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll and slice about 1/2 inch
thickness. You should get enough for about 3 9" round or sq. pans. I cover
the bottom of pans lightly with melted butter--just a small amt! Allow room
for them to double in size!
Place in a proofing oven (turn on oven set to 250 for 2 mins then TURN
OFF and place rolls in off oven). Let rise till very light and double in
bulk (will take about 1 1/2 hrs). Can cover with greased waxed paper. (Do
not use towels as they stick!!) Bake in preheated oven at 375 degrees for
about 20 mins. Remove from pan at once.
Can be frozen. Best when eaten warm! Recipe will work as a caramel roll
OR even just a plain sweet dinner-like roll. DO NOT use too much butter as
they will not rise enough!

Kolach (Braided Bread)

breads, christmas, russian

1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup ; water, lukewarm
2 pkg dry yeast
3 tablespoon sugar
2 cup milk; (about 110 degrees f.)
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon oil or melted butter; you can use up to 4 tbs
8 cup unbleached flour; or more if needed
1 large egg; beaten with
1 tablespoon water; for glaze
2 tablespoon dry poppy seeds

Disolve 1 tsp sugar in the water and sprinkle the
yeast over it.  Add 1 Tbl of sugar, stir and let stand
for 10 minutes.  Combine the yeast with the milk,
lightly beaten eggs, salt, 2 tbl sugar, oil, and 3
cups of sifted flour.  Beat until smooth.  Cover and
let rise in a warm place until light and bubbly, about
1 hour.  Mix in enough of the remaining flour to make
a light, slightly sticky dough, then knead in the bowl
until smooth and elastic,(Remember the heavier the
dough, the heavier the bread.) and leaves the sides of
the bowl easily.  Or in the processor, add the yeast
mixture to the flour and then add the liquids.  With
the machine running, add more flour until a ball
forms.  Allow to rest for several minutes. Process
until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Form into a
ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turning once
to oil the top.  Cover with a linen dish towl, soaked
in hot water and then wrung out until damp only, and
let rise in a warm place until double in bulk.  Punch
down and allow to rise again, slightly.  Divide the
dough into 3 parts.  Divide 1 part into thirds,
rolling each into a rope 8 to 10 inches long and 1 1/2
inches thick. Braid together, starting at the middle
and turn the ends under. Repeat with each of the
remaining parts of the dough.  Place the loaves on
buttered baking sheets.  Do not crowd, since the
loaves will double in size. Cover with the damp towel
and let rise until almost double. Brush with the egg
glaze and sprinkle with the poppy seeds.  Bake in a
preheated 375 Degrees F. oven at least 1 hour, or
until golden.  Test by rapping the bottom, there
should be a nice hollow sound.  Cool on wire racks
until cold before cutting.

Korean Bread

breads, korean

1 lb malt flour
2 lb of red pepper powder
5 lb wheat flour
1 lb soybean flour, fermented
1 gal water
1 lb salt

Lately I've been getting more into Japanese cooking
which is different enough from Chinese that I had to
do some serious larder stocking. It took visits to
three different stores but I finally come up with the
basics. One of the the stores turned out to be++ta
da!++a Korean market so I now have the malt flour you
keep referring to.  In fact, I just put the first loaf
utilizing it into the bread machine a few minutes ago.
Depending on how this loaf turns out, I'll post the
recipe I've worked out for oatmeal bread.

This Korean market is a fairly decent sized store for
a hole in the wall and they have just about everything
one would need for Korean cooking, including a fresh
meat counter.  Nice find!  I'm used to buying things
with labels I can't read, but a lot of the stock in
this store didn't have *any* labels at all!  This
stuff was obviously locally produced by the Korean
community and some was recognizable as Kim Chee,
various bean pastes and the like, but with some of the
stuff, I had absolutely no idea what it was++or even
whether it was animal or vegetable in origin. I'll go
back when I have some time and find out what all those
goodies are.

Here's a recipe that was on the bag of malt flour I
thought you might get a kick out of.  This is exactly
the way it appeared on the bag. Put malt flour into
lukewarm water and set aside for about 1 hour.

Pour the malt melted water into pot (throw away the
button setting). Put wheat flour into malt water, and
make slow boil on low heat, and then simmer for about
1 hour.  Remove the glue from heat and mix fermented
soy bean flour and then lastly add hot pepper powder
and salt, and mix well. *As for salt, you may add or
reduce to your taste.

*For soup use (Chigae), you better add more fermented
soy bean flour.

From the label on Haitai Brand Malt Flour.

Lavash

breads, turkish

1 pkg yeast
2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon sugar
5 1/2 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoon salt

Lightly oil a bowl for the dough.

Mix the yeast, water and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add the flour
and salt and mix until it forms a well-blended but somewhat soft
dough. (resist the temptation to work in any more flour than
absolutely necessary.)

Knead the dough by hand or machine.  If by hand, turn it out on a
floured board and work it until it is smooth and elastic,
approximately 10 minutes. If using a dough hook on an electric mixer,
knead the dough at the slowest speed for about 5 minutes.

Pat the dough into a ball and put it in the oiled bowl. Cover the
dough with a kitchen towel and set it in a warm, draft-free place to
rise until the dough has doubled in bulk, about 30 to 40 minutes.  (A
perfect place is a gas oven with its slight heat given off by the
pilot light; an electric oven, turned on low for no more than 2
minutes, then turned off, works equally well.)

When the dough has doubled, turn it out on a floured board, punch it
down, and knead it again until there is no air left in it.  Divide
the dough into 8 round mounds, place them on the board, cover again
with a towel, and let rise until almost doubled, about 30-minutes.

While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 450F. Position a rack
as close as possible to the oven bottom. Flour a 12x15-in baking
sheet.

When the 8 mounds of dough have risen, roll them out, one piece at a
time into rectangles about 12x15 inches (the size of a standard sheet
pan) and about as thin as for a pizza.  Puncture the entire surface
at 1/2-inch intervals with the tines of a roasting fork.

Bake the breads, one at a time, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the tops
are lightly browned.  Remove each finished bread to a wire rack to
cool and continue baking the remaining breads until all 8 are
finished.  During the baking, if any large bubbles start to puff up,
puncture them immediately with a fork.
_________________________________________________

The bread in the Middle East is tradionally a type of cracker bread
called lavash (lawasha in Assyrian).  This flat leavened bread is
available in grocery stores and specialty markets and can be eaten as
a cracker in the dry, crisp form in which it comes.  However to serve
along with a meal, it is preferable to dampen it so that it becomes
more breadlike.

Moisten the lavash, one cracker at a time, under cold running water,
making sure that both sides are completely wet;  place in a plastic
bag for 3 hours, at the end of which time the bread will be pliable
and chewy. Lavash prepared in this fashion is also used for Aram
sandwiches. In the old country, a lavash bread would bake in a clay
bottomed oven in 2 to 3 minutes.  You can get much the same result
baking on a ceramic baking tile or directly on the floor of a gas
oven.

Lighter Cinnamon Rolls For Bread Machine

desserts, breadmachine

      ----DOUGH----
1 each yeast package
1/4 cup non-fat cottage cheese
1/2 cup warm water
2/3 cup warm non-fat milk
3 cup white bread flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup non-fat liq. egg subst.
3 tablespoon sugar
      ----FILLING----
2 tablespoon corn-oil margarine or
2 tablespoon fat-free butter spray
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
      ----ICING(OPTIONAL----
6 tablespoon powdered sugar, sifted
2 teaspoon non-fat milk

1. Put all dough ingredients into bread machine and run on dough cycle
which mixes, kneads, and rises the bread. At the end of dough cycle,
remove the dough from machine, punch down, and knead on a floured
board for 1 minute. 2. Roll dough out to a 20x12 inch rectangle and
brush with the melted margarine or spray with the non-fat butter
spray. Combine sugars and cinnamon and sprinkle evenly over the
dough. 3. Roll up dough, jelly-roll fashion, starting with the long
edge. Pinch edges together and slice into 12 rolls. Place, cut side
down, onto baking sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place until
doubled, about 45 minutes. 4. Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake 15 to 20
minutes, being careful not to burn rolls. Remove from oven and
drizzle with icing, if desired.  To make icing, combine powdered
sugar and milk and drizzle 1/2 to 1 teaspoon over each roll.

Each roll contains approximately: cal=221, chol=negligible,
fat=3grams, sodium=68mg, protein=8grams, carb=41grams Found in the

Lime & Coconut Milk Bread Abm

breads

      ----BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----
2 1/2 teaspoon yeast
2 cup bread flour
1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup oats
1/4 cup corn meal
3 tablespoon sugar
1/2 tablespoon salt
3 tablespoon lime peel, grated
1 1/2 tablespoon oil
3/4 cup coconut, flaked
1/2 cup coconut milk, unsweetened
1 cup water

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

A big summer fruit salad tastes even better with the tropical taste
of this light bread.  Slices are irresistible with nutted cream
cheese or chicken salad.  Spread with a mashed ripe mango if you
like, but eschew jam, which will hide the subtly sweet but tart taste
of the loaf.

Lowfat Applesauce Cinnamon Rolls - Abm

abm, breakfast, yeast bread, low fat

      ----DOUGH----
1 1/2 teaspoon yeast
4 cup bread flour
3/4 cup applesauce
1/2 cup nonfat milk
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup egg beaters
      ----FILLING----
1/4 cup applesauce
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1/2 cup walnuts; finely chopped,
1  ; optional
      ----ICING----
1 cup powdered sugar; sifted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon nonfat milk

Make dough in automatic bread machine on 'manual' or 'dough' cycle, and
'sweet bread' setting if you have it.

Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface.  Dough should be smooth and
elastic, and soft but not sticky.  If too sticky to handle, knead in a
small amount of extra flour.

Roll dough into a 9" square.  Spread 1/4 c. applesauce over the surface,
combine 1/3 cup sugar and the cinnamon and sprinkle over dough. Sprinkle
(optional) nuts evenly over dough (a few raisins would be nice also). Roll
up and seal seams.

Slice dough into 12 pieces.  Clean kitchen string or thread works best for
this; slip string under roll where you want the cut to be, cross ends over
top of roll and pull.  String will slice dough and cause less distortion
than trying to cut with a knife.

Arrange rolls, cut side down, in a pan sprayed with pan coating.  Let rise
in a warm place until nearly doubled (about 30 minutes).  Meanwhile,
preheat oven to 375 F.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden.

Mix powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla together for icing while rolls are
baking.  Remove from oven to serving dish and drizzle with icing.  Serve
warm.  OR, wrap airtight and freeze for up to 3 weeks; thaw and heat in
microwave at serving time on a plate lined with a paper towel or napkin.

Machine Pain De Mie

breadmachine, ethnic

2 cup bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoon yeast; more or less
1/2 cup semolina flour
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup instant nonfat dry milk soli
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
7/8 cup (1c minus 2t) water

Here's the recipe you requested. This makes one 1 lb loaf on the basic
bread setting. 1. Place all the ingredients in the bread pan and
process on the standard bread setting. 2. Remove bread from the pan
and cool on a rack. Wrap in a plastic bag or foil to store. The
author says that the addition of semolina flour seems to give the
bread that close; even grain required for this type of bread. You can
slice this bread as thin as you like; you can use it for canapes or
fancy sandwiches; you can make melbas or croutons from it once it's 2
or 3 days old. Have fun! Sarah\CA Reformatted by Elaine Radis

Makovyi Knysh (Poppy Seed Roll)

breads, holiday, ethnic, christmas, russian

      ----ROLL DOUGH----
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup ; lukewarm water, 115-120 d
1/2 cup milk; lukewarm
2 3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
4 oz butter; 1 stick
2 tablespoon sugar
1 large egg; beaten with a little wate
      ----POPPY SEED FILLING----
1 cup poppy seeds
1  milk to cover the seeds
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon butter
1  zest of one orange; (orange color on peel)
1  zest of one lemon; (yellow color on peel)
2 large egg whites

ROLL DOUGH:

Dissolve the sugar in the water and milk, then add the yeast,
stirring to dissolve, and let sit for 10 minutes. Combine the flour,
butter (which has been cut into small pieces), and the yeast mixture,
kneading until the dough forms a smooth ball.  Or, in a food
processor with the machine running, add the butter to the flour, then
add the yeast mixture. Process until the dough forms a ball, adding
flour or milk as necessary. Let rest for a few minutes, then process
1 minute more. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, turing once to oil the
top, cover and let rise until double in bulk.

POPPY SEED FILLING:

Pour boiling water over the seeds, let stand for 5 minutes, pour off
the water and repeat, draining well. Cover with the milk in a
saucepan and bring to a boil, then strain. Grind with the steel blade
in a blender or processor until the seeds release the milk and turn
white, then add the sugar, honey, and butter.  Cook in a heavy
skillet for 1 minute over high heat.  Cool. When cool, add the egg
whites and zests, blending well.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a long rectangle
about 1-inch thick.  Spread the filling evenly over the dough
stopping 1-inch from one long edge and roll up, making sure that the
filling is sealed inside.  Place on a non-stick baking sheet, seam
side down. Bake in a preheated 350 Degree F. oven for 35 to 40
minutes. Brush with the egg laze and cool on a wire rack.

Malted Rye Bread Abm

breads

      ----BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----
1 1/4 cup milk
1/2 tablespoon yeast
2 1/2 cup bread flour
1 cup rye flour
1/2 tablespoon salt
3/4 teaspoon cardamom, ground
1/4 cup oil
1 tablespoon barley malt syrup
1/3 cup honey
3  eggs

Scald milk and let cool to room temperature.

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Since the flavor of this loaf is not too assertive, but the texture is
substantial, it is a good sandwich bread for spicy meats, such as
salami or pate, and ripe cheese. For early in the day eating, toast
and spread with orange marmalade or apple butter.

I finally found it and we are hooked. Thanks to my bread maker; we
have no excuse for not having a great homemade pizza in no time. I
hope you'll try it out and let me know how you like it. By the way,
this doesn't make a Pizza Hut type of pan pizza dough, instead it is
a hand-tossed type that is tender and not tough...delicious! Try it.
Another note: I have a Welbilt 350.

Put all ingredients in your bread maker on manual and let it do the
work. I let it rise for a little longer after it finishes, but judge
for yourself if it requires that. Divide into two 12" pies (I roll it
out) Put on two cornmeal covered pans, prick with a fork, brush with
oil, add toppings and preheat your oven to 500F. Let the pizzas rise
for 15 minutes or so, then bake for 7 minutes. MMMama Mia!! I've
gotten great recipes off this BB, so I thought I'd reciprocate! Hope
you like it!!

Margaret's Buttermilk Raisin Bread

breads, abm, dairy

3 tablespoon dry buttermilk powder
7/8 cup water
1  egg
3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon sugar
1/3 cup butter or margarine
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup raisins
1 1/2 teaspoon yeast

Place all ingredients in bread pan, select Light Crust setting, and
press Start.

After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake
rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

This bread earns rave reviews from all tasters!  It's very moist and
tender, and is delicious toasted.  Our friend Margaret loved it at
first taste.  In fact, shortly after that she purchased a bread
machine. It *really* is that good.  (Note:  For the rapid-baking
1-pound Welbilt machine, reduce the butter to 1 1/2 tablespoons and
the raisins to 1/3 cup.)

This is a delicious buttermilk loaf!  I like to put the raisins in at
the "beep" so they don't get smushed up.

SOURCE;  The Bread Machine Cookbook II by Donna Rathmell German,
copyright 1991, ISBN 1-55867-037-8.
Formatted into MM by Ursula R. Taylor.
The following is in the introduction to the chapter of this book headed
Pizza, Meat Pies, & Hand Pies.  If you have a Panasonic SDBT6P or a
National SDBT6N you may make some of these breads on the Variety Bread
Cycle.  This cycle enables you to remove the dough, place fillings into it
and replace it into the machine for baking. Follow the directions given in
your owner's manual.....
Owners of all other machines should make the recipes on the dough
setting, remove, fill according to following directions and bake (in your
conventional oven). A small amount of flour may be used when rolling dough
ro prevent if from sticking.
To make the meat filling:  Cut cheese into 1-inch cubes and mix together
with cooked, drained but still hot meats. Cheese should warm enough to
serve as the "glue" for the filling. If cheese is not melting into meat,
warm in microwave for a minute or two.  Roll as jelly-roll or stromboli...
For jelly-roll - remove dough from machine and roll into a rectangle.
Spread filling on top. Starting from wide end, roll dough jelly-roll
fashine to encase filling, pince ends closed, - place on a nonstick bakin
pan and let rise for 1/2 hour.....OR For Stromboli - remove dough from
machine and roll into a rectangle.  Spread filling ingredients over the
middle third of the rectangle so it runs the lenght of the wide end. Fold
one side over top of the filling and then the other sideon top ot that;
pinch ends closed.  Place, seam side down, on a lightly buttered baking
sheet, cover and let rise for about 30 minutes. Lightly olive oil top....
Bake either way in a preheated 350~ oven for 20 to 25 minutes.....

Microwave Parmesan Herb Muffins

breads, microwave

2 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoon buttermilk, powdered
1/2 teaspoon sage leaves
1/4 cup cheese, parmesan, grated
1 1/4 cup water; hot
1/4 cup butter
1  eggs

Preheat oven to 400.  Line 12 muffin cups with paper baking cups. In
large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, sage,
buttermilk powder, and cheese. Blend well. Add hot water, butter, and
egg; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. Fill prepared
muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake 15-20 minutes, until toothpick inserted
into center comes out clean. Serve hot.

MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Prepare muffin batter as directed above. Using
6 cup microwave-safe muffin pan, line each with 2 paper baking cups
to absorb moisture during baking. Fill cups 1/2 full. Sprinkle top of
each muffin with cornflake crumbs.  Microwave 6 muffins on HIGH for 2
1/2 to 3 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out
clean, rotating pan 1/2 turn halfway through baking.  Remove muffins
from pan and immediatedly discard outer baking cups. Cool 1 minute on
wire rack before serving. Repeat with remaining batter.

Sylvia's comments: I don't have a microwave-safe muffin pan, so just
baked them in the oven.  The tops had the tipped-hat look I sometimes
get in breadmachine bread, and Peter commented that the muffins
tasted just like my bread.  It's not a bad recipe, but it's not good
enough that I want to keep it.

Minnie & Aunt Pete's Yeast Rolls

breads

6 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar
3 teaspoon salt
2  egg whites
2 pkg yeast
2 1/4 cup warm water, 110 degrees

Cut shortening into flour, salt and sugar. Dissolve yeast in warm
water and add to flour mixture, then add egg whites. Mix together,
knead until smooth and elastic (DON'T overknead and add only enough
flour to keep dough from sticking) and let rise 1-1/2 hours, or until
doubled in size.

Punch dough down, roll out on a lightly floured surface, shape into
rolls and place in greased muffin tins . Let rise until doubled in
size and bake in a 375 degree oven 10 to 12 minutes or until brown.

NOTE: these rolls can also be frozen on cookie sheets and placed in
zip-loc freezer bags for up to 4 weeks after they have been shaped
before the second rising. Take out of freezer at least 3 hours before
baking, place in greased tin and let thaw and rise until doubled in
size.

notes: these are an old family favorite and they're quite flexible.
It's pretty hard to mess 'em up. They work as well for breakfast with
jam or honey as they do with with dinner. Sometimes I substitute
whole wheat flour for up to half the bread flour called for.

I've successfully halved the recipe (3 cups bread flour, 1 pkg yeast
or about 1-1/2 ts bulk) in my Hitachi ABM--BUT, BUT, BUT--I _don't_
add the full amount of water at once. Rather, I start out with about
7/8 cup and then dribble enough add'l water into the bread pan during
the early stages of the knead cycle 'til the dough "looks right".

Molasses Doughnuts ABM

breads, desserts

3 tablespoon shortening
3  eggs
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking powder
4 tablespoon buttermilk; dried
1 teaspoon ginger
2 teaspoon cinnamon
3 3/4 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon yeast
1/2 cup powdered sugar; or
1/2 cup granulated sugar

Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature.  Place the first 11
ingredients in the machine. Program for knead and first rise and press
start. The dough will be just a little sticky; a tiny amount will
stick to your finger. It does hold some shape while kneading.  Flour
your work surface and rolling pin. When the cycle is complete, turn
the dough out onto the floured surface and let it sit for 10 minutes.
Roll the dough to 1/3" thick. Use enough flour to keep the dough from
sticking. Cut doughnuts with cutter.

Place the doughnuts on a greased baking sheet and cover with a clean
towel. Let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk. Heat 1 1/2 to
2" of oil in saucepan or deep fryer. Use a thermometer to help keep
the temperature constant. Fry 2 to 3 doughnuts at a time.  Fry them
for 2 to 3 minutes, turning frequently and spooning the hot oil over
them. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Check the
first few for doneness. Shake the warm doughnuts, 3 or 4 at a time,
in a sturdy paper bag with sugar in it.

Multi-Grain & Nut Bread

abm

      ----WENDY CERACCHE DBCP84B----
1 1/4 cup bread flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
3 tablespoon rye flour
3 tablespoon yellow cornmeal
1/3 cup rolled oats
3 tablespoon quaker multi-grain
2 tablespoon oat flour
3 tablespoon wheat germ(honey crunch)
1 cup water
1/2 cup milk or cottage cheese
1 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon vital gluten
1 1/2 teaspoon yeast
      ----ADD WHEN DOUGH FORMED----
1/4 cup walnuts(or other); chopped
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1/4 cup carrots; grated(optional)

Add everything (except the seeds and nuts) to breadbaker in the order
appropriate for your machine. I have Panasonic and use VARIETY Cycle
which allows me to take the dough out, work with it, then put it
back(minus the blade-VERY IMPORTANT) to continue to bake. If you
don't have this feature, you can just set it to a dough cycle and
finish baking manually. The important thing with this bread is that
you have to add the seeds and nuts separately because of the large
qty, otherwise they will fly around the machine and make a mess.
**For the Panasonic, on the Variety Cycle, it will beep after about 2
hrs. and 20 min. (and will indicate 1:55 on machine). When it beeps,
take dough out and put on a floured surface. Also TAKE DOUGH BLADE
OUT OF BUCKET. Add the seeds & nuts, carrots too if desired. (Raisins
can also be added as well). Work it into the dough, so it is spread
fairly evenly. Put back in bucket, and press START. *** You can also
roll out dough, place ingredients on top and then roll up the dough,
tucking under the ends.

My Best Raisin Bread

breads, breadmachine, breakfast, gift

1 1/8 cup water
3 cup bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon browm sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 tablespoon dry milk
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast
3/4 cup raisins

Place all ingredients in order listed (for Hitachi machine). Set on
regular or rapid bread settings.  Adjust as needed for your machine.

This was adapted by me from a recipe which came with my machine.  I
find this to be equal to the raisin bread we used to get fresh from
the bakery. It is a heavy, rich and sweet loaf. Excellent for
snacking or breakfast.

Naan For Breadmaker

breads, breadmachine

1/2 tablespoon yeast
3 cup flour
1/2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
3/4 cup yogurt
      Water ----topping-----
4 tablespoon butter
4 tablespoon onions; chopped

A flat bread from India.  Make sure your oven is well preheated.

Use dough cycle on machine.  Remove dough from machine and divide
into 12 parts.

Preheat oven to 500.  Roll each part into a small circle (about 8"
diameter) and place on greased pizza or other baking pan. Brush top
of each one with melted butter and press finely chopped onion into
dough. Bake 10-15 minutes until puffy and brown.

Sylvia's notes: Yummmmmmmy!  However, 10 minutes in MY oven turned it
almost black; 5 minutes 30 seconds (at 475, since my oven runs a
little hot) turned the nan golden brown and perfect. Also, I rolled
it too thin at first.  They came out much better when I didn't roll
them paper thin, more like 1/8" thin.  I put spoonsful of
Yogurt-Cucumber Salad on them; this is the best bread I've ever
tasted for eating-food-on. However, as delicious as it is, I doubt
I'll make it often; all the rolling and brushing with butter and
pushing onions in is just too much work.

Donna German's note:  While traditional "Nan" has onions, try
substituting 1-2 ts lemon or orange peel, anise or fennel seeds. Just
sprinkle on top of melted butter.

To Donna C And everyone else. I have been experimenting to get a

family really liked. Let me know how you all feel.

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS FOR THE BIG 1 1/2 LB. BREAD MAKER SCALE DOWN FOR

know how it would be on that mode. Hope you'all enjoy!

Mort has made this bread for the past month and now it is our
favorite as well.  It works well with Smiley's yeast and I don't add
the gluton (cause we are out of it, <g>) and it is STILL fine! * We

Mash potato well to make 1/2 cup. Let potato and cooking liquid cool
to room temperature.

From large (1-1/2lb to 2lb) bread machine, remove baking pan. Add to
pan (in order) cooking water, oil, sugar, salt, mashed potatoes and
flour. Sprinkle with yeast, making sure yeast does not touch water
mixture.

According to manufacturer's instructions, choose cycle appropriate to
nonsweet- or nonfresh-milk bread.

When baked, immediately remove pan from machine; shake loaf from pan.
Let cool completely on rack.

Because yeast thrives on starch, adding mashed potatoes to this loaf
creates an airy, even-textured bread. Ideally suited for hearty
sandwiches and toasts beautifully.

No-Oil Pizza Crust For Large-Loaf Bread Machi

abm

1 tablespoon yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup cornmeal
3 tablespoon whole wheat flour
3 cup white bread flour
1 1/4 cup warm water
2 tablespoon applesauce

put bread machine on white bread - manual setting and dump
ingredients in according to your machine's preferences

when cycle is all done, remove and separate into 3-4 balls of dough.
Place on floured wax paper and let rise for about 20 mins. more (add
a little flour if dough is too sticky). Shape, top, and bake til done
in a very hot oven (mine goes to 550 degrees).

Notes: When I didn't have cornmeal, I substituted whole wheat flour
and it worked just as well. Also, the first time I made it, I had to
use oil (my kids had eaten all of the applesauce) -- it worked just
the same, so the substitution of applesauce seems to make no real
difference in taste, texture, or appearance.

Norwegian Nog Christmas Bread

breads, holiday, machine

1 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup low-fat or regular eggnog,
1  heated to 105 to 115 degrees
2 cup bread flour (to 2 1/4c)
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
4 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
1/3 cup dried currants or raisins
1/3 cup chopped candied fruit & rind
1  confectioners' sugar glaze

1. Combine yeast and eggnog in the bucket of a bread machine,
stirring to dissolve yeast. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Add 1 cup flour. Begin dough cycle, letting it run just long enough
to mix dough. Stop cycle and  leave mixture in bucket, covered, until
it is light and puffy, about 1 hour.

2. Add 1 cup of the remaining flour, the cardamom, salt, egg, egg
yolk and butter. Begin dough cycle. After dough is mixed and as it is
still kneading, check the texture of the dough and add additional
flour as needed, to make a  soft, slightly sticky dough. Add currants
and fruit as indicated in instruction manual. Complete dough cycle.
When bread is cool, glaze if  desired.

Note: If you prefer a traditional shape, the dough can be removed
from the bread machine after the rising cycle. Shape dough into an
oval, place it on a greased baking sheet, cover and let rise at room
temperature for about 40 minutes. Brush the loaf with a glaze made
from an egg yolk mixed with 1 tablespoon whipping cream; sprinkle
with coarse sugar. Bake in a heated 325 degree oven until golden, 30
to 35 minutes.

No-Sugar Sweet Bread

breads

1/2 tablespoon yeast
2 1/2 cup flour, bread
1 1/8 tablespoon fructose
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon butter
2  eggs
3/4 cup milk

Cycle: White, sweet; not time (milk, egg) Setting: Light to medium

"For those who cannot or prefer not to eat refined sugar, this
delicious recipe uses natural fructose which may be found in grocery
stores or health food stores. One tester experimented with her ricpe
by substituting Sugar Twin for the fructose.  She recommends using 1
Tbl. - 1 1/2 Tbl. or 2 Tbl. for a regular loaf and doubling that
amount for a sweeter loaf."

2  egg whites (use ingredients at room; temperature.)
1 1/2 cup freshly grated carrots (3-4 whole c; arrots)
2 cup plus 2 tbsp very warm water

"Soluble fiber from both carrots and oat bran can really help fight
cholesterol. Bot oh, wait till you taste the rich full-bodied, freshly
grated carrot flavor. If you love carrot cake, wait till you try this
great tasting, good-for-you oat bran bread."

listed. Add 1 cup plus the 2 Tbsp of very warm water. Select white

machine mixes the dough, add the remaining very warm water slowly.

This recipe is very large and may kick up some flour over the edge or
on the glass dome at the beginning. Adding the liquid slowly will
help prevent this. The pan will be very full and the bread won't rise
very much. But, it will be a tall loaf. If your rises too much, cut
down on the liquid. If it seems too dry, increase the liquid.

Oatmeal Raisin Bread - Dak

breadmachine, dak

2 1/2 teaspoon yeast
1 cup oatmeal
2 cup bread flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon gluten
2 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon oil or applesauce
1 1/4 cup warm water
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 cup chopped nuts (optional)
1 teaspoon cinnamon

You can add the raisins and nuts at the beginning of the cycle or at
the "beeps"  You may need to add more water. Here in AZ I have to add
a couple more tablespoons of water when the weather is very dry. If
the machine seems to strain to knead the dough, add a little more
water. Use the sweet bread cycle, as the sugar and raisins make the
crust brown quickly. I put a piece of foil on top to brown the top
crust a bit more.

Olive Fougasse - Breadmaker

abm

1 tablespoon bread machine yeast
2 1/2 cup bread flour
2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup warm milk
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup fruity olive oil, + extra for coati; ng the dough
1/3 cup chopped nicoise or green olives

Combine the yeast, flour, sugar, salt, milk, water and 1/4 cup olive
oil in the bread machine pan and process on the dough setting. At the
end of the cycle, turn out the dough onto a lightly floured board and
knead in the olives. Turn the bread pan over the dough and let it
rest for 15 minutes.

Divide the dough into two equal pieces and roll each piece into an 8
~by-10-inch rectangle. Place each rectangle on a parchment
paper-covered baking sheet. Make two rows of 6 to 8 evenly spaced
diagonal slashes, cutting all the way through the dough. Open these
slits by pulling them well apart with your hands. Coat the flatbreads
with olive oil and set aside to rise until the dough is puffed, about
20    minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 F. After the breads are puffy, bake in the
hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on a rack.
These are best eaten the day they're made, but they can be stored in
plastic wrap.

Two 8-by-10-inch flatbreads

NOTE:  This olive-rich is rolled into aangle and thenslashed with a
knife to form traditional patterns. The sunburst is popular, or a
tree branch, a moon, or a sunflower. You won't need butter with this
olive oil -drenched bread. It's a perfect accompaniment to salade
Nicoise. Use dough setting.

1 1/2 pkg yeast, active dry
4 1/2 cup bread flour
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon non-fat dry milk
1  onion, med., diced
2 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 cup water, warm

This recipe will make two loaves of bread in a standard loaf pan and
calls for using a bread machine to do most of the labor.

Place all ingredients into the bread machine in the order listed.
Dried minced onions may be substituted for diced onion but water MUST
be increased to approx. 2 1/2 cups. Place bread machine on setting
for white bread and start.  When bread has completed it's second
kneading, remove dough.  Cut dough in half and shape into two loaves
and place in two greased and floured loaf pans. Place into a warm (90
deg) oven on the top rack.  Place a pot of water that has been
brought to a boil on the rack below the bread.  Cover bread with a
moist tea towel.

Allow bread to rise until doubled in size.  Remove towel and bake at
350 deg. for approx. 45 mins. Remove from oven and remove bread from
loaf pans to cool. This bread is particularly good when toasted.

Onion Sourdough Rye

breads, breadmachine, sourdough, rye

1/2 cup 2/3 c.
1/2 cup 2/3 c.
2 cup 2 1/3 c.
1/2 cup 2/3 c.
2 tablespoon 3 tbl.
1 tablespoon 1 1/2 tbl.
1 teaspoon 1 1/2 tsp.
1/2 teaspoon 1 tsp.
1/2 cup 2/3 c.
1/4 cup 5 tbl.
1 tablespoon 2 tbl.
2 teaspoon 1 pkg.

The day before you wish to make this bread, place the onions in a
small bowl with the starter.  Cover the bowl and leave at room
temperature for 12 hours.  Fit the kneading blade firmly on the shaft
in the bread pan. Carefully measure the dry ingredients and transfer
to the pan. Add the onions and starter, water, yogurt, oil and yeast.
Place the bread pan inside the machine and close the lid. Program the
breadmaker for the whole wheat mode.  The unit will begin its
operation. At the end of the baking cycle, remove the bread promptly
from the machine, taking care, as the oven surfaces will be very hot.
Invert the bread pan onto a wire rack and shake several times to
dislodge the bread. Allow to cool completely on the rack before
slicing or wrapping for store. Source: The Bread Machine Gourmet by

Outrageously Oatmeal Bread

abm

1 tablespoon yeast
1/2 cup oats
3 cup bread flour
1/2 tablespoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon dry milk
2 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoon honey
1 1/4 cup water

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 11 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

For added texture, add oats after the first knead or at the beep on
the fruit and nut cycle.  For additional crunch, sprinkle a few oats
on top of th loaf after the final rise.

Tried this one yesterday, and not only was it good, it is GONE! I
subbed applesauce for the fat with no problems. I've got a loaf
working now, also subbing whole-wheat flour for part of the white and
with 1/2 c sprouted wheat added.

Outrageously Oatmeal Bread For Bread Machine

breads, breadmachine

      ----REGULAR LOAF----
3/4 cup water
2 cup white bread flour
1 tablespoon dry milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon fast rise yeast  **or**
1 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
      ----LARGE LOAF----
1 1/4 cup water
3 cup white bread flour
1 1/2 tablespoon dry milk
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon honey
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 teaspoon fast rise yeast  **or**
3 teaspoon active dry yeast

SUCCESS HINTS: For added texture, add the oats after the first knead
or at the beep on the fruit and nut cycle. For additional crunch,
sprinkle a few oats on top of the loaf after the final rise. Instant
oatmeal doesn't work, but quick-cooking oats do. This recipe can be
made with the regular, rapid, or delayed time bake cycles. CALORIES:

Measure carefully, adding ingredients in bread machine pan in the
order recommended by the manufacturer - except cherries, raisins or
currants and almonds.  Select Sweet or Basic/White cycle.  Use Light
or Medium crust color.  Add red and green candied cherries, raisins
or currants, and almonds at the raisin/nut cycle or 5 minutes before
last kneading cycle ends.  The dough becomes VERY SOFT and WET in
appearance at this point! DO NOT add flour, as the bread will become
tough.

Remove baked bread from pan and cool on wire rack. PER SERVING: 260

Pasta Dough (Manual Pasta Machines Only)

breads, pasta, italian

2 1/3 cup all purpose flour
1  (for better pasta, use
1 1/3 cup ap flour and
1 cup semolina flour)
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup water

Mix 2 cups flour and salt in bowl, reserve 1/3 cup for later. Make a
well in the center Mix eggs, olive oil and water and pour into well.
Stir flour into egg mixture until dough forms into a ball. Turn out
onto floured surface and kneed for about 10 minutes, adding extra
flour if too moist. Kneed until dough is smooth and elastic. Cover
with towel and rest for 30 minutes. Cut into 4 portions, keep pieces
covered until used.

Get out your machine and set dial on widest setting (1 on the Atlas).
Flatten dough ball and run through rollers several times until smooth
(you may add a bit of flour here too). Move rollers to next setting
and roll again once. Continue to roll until pasta is the proper
thickness (5 or 6 on the Atlas).  You may cut sheet in half if it's
too long. Continue with other pieces and then put the finished sheet
aside to dry for about 3 minutes.  Attach desired pasta cutters and
run the sheets through.

You can use right away or spread out the pasta to dry overnight and
then freeze extra.

To cook, drop into large pot of boiling water with a bit of salt and
oil. Cook until al dente, which should only take about 2 minutes for
fresh.

A tip - be sure the dough is fairly dry, otherwise it won't cut into
separate strands.

Another tip - You can substitute heavy cream for the 1/3 c water for a
richer pasta. Great for fettuchini alfredo.

Pear & Hazelnut Bread Abm

breads

      ----BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----
1 1/2 large pears
3 tablespoon oil
1/2 tablespoon yeast
2 cup bread flour
1 1/8 cup rye flour
3 tablespoon wheat germ
3 tablespoon sugar
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/2 tablespoon fennel seeds
3 tablespoon hazelnuts, chopped
1/2 cup water; warm

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start. In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Ripe, actually overripe, pears make the sweetest, moistest bread. This
subtly flavored loaf does fine on its own and makes excellent plain,
cinnamon, or French toast. Or place a thin slice of cold cooked lamb
on it and briefly warm in the broiler.

Pecan Bread

breadmachine

1 pkg yeast
3 1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon corn oil
1 cup toasted chopped pecans

Place ingredients in breadmaker. Process on white bread cycle. Any
nut can be substituted for pecans.
They don't really need to be chopped before placing in the
breadmaker. Sometimes I need to add extra flour to this recipe. As
always oat flour is a fine preservative and your bread will keep
longer.

Pecan Coffee Cake ABM

breads, desserts

1 1/2  unsalted butter; at room temperature
3  eggs
3  egg yolks
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup sugar
3 1/4 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon yeast
      ----FILLING----
6 tablespoon unsalted butter; cut into 1 pieces
1 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/3 cup corn syrup
3 tablespoon molasses
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 cup pecan halves; toasted

Place all dough ingredients in the machine.  Program for knead and
first rise and press start. At the end of the final cycle, transfer
the dough to a well-oiled bowl, cover it with plastic and refrigerate
for 2 hours. Generously butter a 12 cup bundt pan. Place the butter,
sugar, corn syrup and molasses in a 2 quart saucepan set over medium
heat. Allow the mixture to come to a boil. Cook 2 minutes at full
boil. Remove from the heat and add the cream. Stir in combine and
then immediately stir in the pecans. Continue to mix until all the
pecans are covered.

Pour a third of the filling into the prepared pan and set aside the
rest to cool while you prepare the dough. On a lightly floured work
surface, roll the dough into a 20 x 9 inch rectangle. Place the
prepared pan nearby. Pour the rest of the filling down the length of
the dough and use a metal spatula to quickly spread it to within 2"
of the edges. Flip one long side of the dough over the middle, then
the other, to form a long roll. Quickly lift the roll and place it in
the pan so that the ends overlap slightly.

Cover the pan with lightly oiled plastic wrap and allow the dough to
rise in warm place until doubled in bulk. Preheat the oven to 375øF.
with the rack in the center position. Bake for 20 minutes and then
reduce the heat to 350øF. and bake it another 20 to 25 minutes. If
the top is getting too brown, cover it loosely with foil. Put a cake
rack over a large plate. Remove cake from oven and turn over onto the
rack. Scoop up any filling that drips off and place it back on cake.
Once filling has cooled, remove the cake to a serving plate.

Piccia Calabrese (Calabrian Bread)

breads, italian

2 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1 1/4 cup biga
2 tablespoon lard
2 tablespoon sliced mushrooms
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoon canned tomatoes with juices
1 small anchovy fillets; boned and c
1 tablespoon capers; drained and chopped
6 small cocktail onions; chopped
2 tablespoon artichokes; finely chopped
3  gherkins; chopped
2  roasted red peppers; chopped
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour; unbleache
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper

Recipe by: Carol Field - The Italian Baker Refrigerate the Biga until
cold. stir the yeast into the water in a small bowl; let stand until
creamy, about 10 minutes. Saute the mushrooms briefly in the oil and
let cool. Roughly chop the tomato, mushrooms, anchovy, capers,
onions, artichoke, pickles, and red peppers in a food processor
fitted with the steel blade. Remove to another bowl. Process the
oregano, flour, salt, and pepper with 5 or 6 pulses to mix. Place the
cold starter and the lard over the dry ingredients.  With the machine
running pour the dissolved yeast through the feed tube as quickly as
the flour can absorb it. Add the vegetable mixture and process just
until combined.  Finish kneading by hand on a well-floured surface,
sprinkling with 1/2 to 2/3 cup additional flour as needed, until
elastic, moist, and velvety.

First Rise:  Place the dough in an oiled bowl,  cover with plastic
wrap, and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1
1/2    hours.

Shaping and Second Rise:  Shape the dough on a floured surface into 1
large or 2 smaller round loaves by rolling the dough first into a
taut log, then shaping it into a round loaf. The dough will be
slightly sticky; sprinkle the dough and the work surface with flour
while shaping it. Place each loaf on a peel sprinkled with cornmeal,
cover with a slightly dampened towel, and let rise until doubled,
about 50 minutes.

Baking:  Thirty minutes before baking, heat the oven with baking
stones in it to 425F.  Just before baking, cut an even slash around
the shoulder of the loaf or 3 slashes across the top with a razor.
Sprinkle the stones with cornmeal and slide the loaves onto the
stones. bake, spraying 3 times with water in the first 10 minutes,
for 45 minutes. Cool on racks.

Pizza Crust For Small Bread Machines (Abm)

abm

2 1/4 cup bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon applesauce
3/4 cup water
1 teaspoon yeast

after cycle is done, cut into 4 portions; cover with plastic wrap and
let rise for 20 mins. Shape, top, and bake 12-15 mins. in a 500
degree oven.

Note: I haven't tested this one, so let me know if it works.

By the way, I cheated and sprayed the pans a little so the pizza
wouldn't stick. I really need to get more non-stick cookware.

Pizza Dough Abm

breads

1/2 tablespoon yeast
3 1/4 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1 1/8 cup water
      ----TO SHAPE PIZZA----
1  corn meal

Bring all ingredients to room temp and add to breadmaker. Select
"white dough" cycle and press Start.

At end of cycle, remove dough and divide into halves. Preheat oven to
450. Roll or shape into pizzas on surface dusted with cornmeal. Add
toppings of choice and bake 15 minutes on bottom rack, to make sure
crust gets done.

Sylvia's notes: I modified this from one posted on GEnie by G.GARVEY2
10/30/91, and was thoroughly delighted with the result. The dough was
easy to work with and stretched well; I even played "Italian pizza
maker" and threw the thing into the air to stretch it. We had company
for dinner, and when I asked for comments because I wasn't an
accomplished pizza maker, one guest responded "you are now!"

SUCCESS HINTS: Use stick pepperoni and dice into 1/4" chunks As with
all cheese breads, loaf appearance will be unusual due to the
moisture of the cheese -- a small price to pay for great taste! This
bread can be made with the regular and rapid bake cycles. CALORIES:

Plain Old Fashioned White Bread

abm, misc

3 cup bread flour; (i use 1/2 cup whole whea
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon powdered milk
1 tablespoon sugar; (if you have trouble  wit
1 tablespoon margarine; or olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoon powdered yeast

When the ABM starts look inside and watch the dough it should be just
one big ball that is fairly soft, if its sticky and gooshy you have
to add more flour. If there is still flour laying around and its as
hard as a brick you have to add water. You have to do this with just
about every NEW recipe until you get the right combination for your
machine, flour, and climate.

First thing you need to do is get some bread flour (there is a
difference) and get some yeast in bulk. Do not use the little
packages they are just to expensive. Most of the big warehouse clubs
carry yeast in bigger packages.

If this don't work get back to us and tell us what is going on.

3/16 cup potato flakes
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup flour
1 1/4 teaspoon yeast

onto a lightly floured board. Divide dough and allow to rest for 5 to
10 minutes. Divide each half of dough into 12 even pieces. Turn the
ball of dough inside out and pinch the ends together on the bottom.
This will give you a smooth ball. Place seam side down on ungreased
cookie sheet (if your cookie sheet looks like its seen better days,
spray a thin layer of nonstick spray). You can either have sides
touching for soft-sided rolls or not touching for more "crusty"
rolls. Allow to rise 30 - 40 minutes or until doubled. Bake in an
oven preheated to 425 for 15 to 18 minutes or until of desired
browness.

Pretzels For The Breadmaker

breads, breadmachine

      ----PRETZELS----
2 1/2 teaspoon yeast
4 cup flour
2/3 teaspoon salt
1 1/3 tablespoon sugar
2 1/2 tablespoon margarine; or butter water
      ----WATER FOR 'BATH----
4 cup -water; at a simmer
5 teaspoon baking soda

Add into the bread machine in this order.  Set on manual.

FORMING: Cut dough into short strips, roll into ropes and shape into
pretzels. Cover with a tea towel and let rise for 45 minutes. 'BATH':
In a cast iron or OTHER NON-ALUMINUM pan, bring almost to a boil 4
cups of water and 5 teaspoons of baking soda. Gently place (by hand
or using slotted spoon) the pretzels into the water for approximately
15 seconds on each side turning once. Do NOT let water come to a
boil. Remove pretzels and place on a greased baking sheet. Sprinkle
with coarse salt (kosher). Bake at 475 for 12 minutes.

NOTE: In my oven it took only about 10 minutes, so watch carefully.
Do NOT make the strips too fat; they really puff up. If you are on a
salt-free diet, use sesame, poppy, garlic; whatever you like on the
outside...the WHOLE family, both upstairs and downstairs loved them
and the DAK did all the hard work.
* If you use a machine that needs the water first add ingredients in
reverse order. FROM: Donna German's THE BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK I and

Processor French Bread

breads, french

1/2 cup warm water (105 f)
1 1/2 pkg active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
3 1/2 cup all-purpose or unbleached flour
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup warm water (105 f)

Makes 2 loaves

Flour

Generously grease baguette pans.

Combine 1/2 cup warm water with yeast and 1 tsp sugar in small bowl
and let stand until yeast is dissolved and mixture is foamy, about 5
minutes.

Combine flour, salt, remaining sugar and yeast mixture in work bowl
of food processor.  With machine running, slowly begin adding 1 cup
warm water. A soft ball should form in several seconds; if not, add a
little more warm water.  Let machine run 15 to 20 seconds, adding
more flour if dough seems too soft.

Transfer dough to lightly floured board and knead with a little
additional flour for several turns.  Divide dough in half and shape
into two cylinders 8 to 10 inches long. Transfer to prepared pans and
cut 3 or 4 diagonal slashes in top of each loaf with tip of knife or
single-edged razor blade. Cover and let rise in warm place until
doubled, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

After about 30 minutes, place racks in middle and lower quarters of
oven and begin preheating to 450 F. Center shallow pan of water on
lower rack. When dough has doubled, place on middle rack directly
above water and bake 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 400 F and continue
baking an additional 15 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown and
have a hollow sound when tapped with finger.

Pumpkin & Raisin Bread

breads

      ----1 1/2 POUND LOAF----
4 teaspoon red star active dry yeast
3 cup bread flour + 3 ts ***(see
1  note below)
3 tablespoon wheat germ
3 tablespoon powdered milk
3 tablespoon gluten
4 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup canned pumpkin
2/3 cup water
3 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/2 cup raisins

I have a Hitachi 101, and this recipe has been successful. It makes a
7 inch tall loaf.  This is a soft fluffy loaf.

Other bread machines will have to alter to manufacturers guidelines.

Have all ingredients at room temperature.

Mix the pumpkin, water and butter in glass mixing cup. Microwave on
high for approx. 60 seconds.  Test to make sure the liquid is warm to
the touch. Because the pumpkin is very dense, it may have to be
zapped a bit longer. If liquid gets too warm, pour into machine bread
pan and stir with rubber spatula so the coolness of the pan can cool
down the liquid.

Add ingredients to bread pan according to manufacturers directions.

About 5 minutes into the mixing cycle check to see if the dough is too
sticky - if so you may have to add additional flour, one teaspoon at a
time.  After the rest cycle, and the kneading starts up again, check
again for texture.  This dough usually runs a*little*bit sticky.
Start adding the raisins about 12 minutes into the cycle. (Adding
them at the beeper on my machine sometimes makes the raisins gather
at the bottom of the pan and they refuse to blend into the dough).

Bake on "mix bread" cycle, with Light Crust setting.

*** Depending on humidity more flour may be needed 1 teaspoon at a
time.
(see above)

I have not tried this on a delayed timer, or on rapid rise.

The end result is a bread that tastes like pumpkin pie and raisins.

Mix the pumpkin, water and butter in glass mixing cup.  Microwave on high
for approx. 60 seconds.  Test to make sure the liquid is warm to the touch.
Because the pumpkin is very dense, it may have to be zapped a bit longer.
If liquid gets too warm, pour into machine bread pan and stir with rubber
spatula so the coolness of the pan can cool down the liquid.

Add ingredients to bread pan according to manufacturers directions.

About 5 minutes into the mixing cycle check to see if the dough is too
sticky - if so you may have to add additional flour, one teaspoon at a
time.  After the rest cycle, and the kneading starts up again, check again
for texture.  This dough usually runs a*little*bit sticky. Start adding the
raisins about 12 minutes into the cycle.  (Adding them at the beeper on my
machine sometimes makes the raisins gather at the bottom of the pan and
they refuse to blend into the dough).

Bake on "mix bread" cycle, with Light Crust setting.

The end result is a bread that tastes like pumpkin pie and raisins.

Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comments: extremely moist bread, bordering on
gummy.  It also didn't rise as high as 3-cup-loaves usually do, only about
2/3 the way up the pan.  I suspect a little more water would have helped,
but I did this loaf on the timer (sans raisins) and didn't see what the
dough looked like.

Pumpkin Gingerbread Loaves

breads

2 cup all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 cup molasses
2  eggs
1/3 cup margarine or butter
1/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon grated fresh gingerroot or
1 teaspoon ground ginger`
1/3 cup finely chopped walnuts
2 tablespoon sugar

Grease the bottom and sides of four 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 1 1/2-inch loaf
pans. Grease only halfway up the sides.  That way the loaves will
have nicely rounded tops and no unwanted rims around the edges.  Set
aside.

Stir together 1 cup of the flour, the brown sugar, baking powder,
cinnamon, and baking soda.  Add the pumpkin, molasses, eggs,
margarine or butter, and gingerroot or ginger.  Beat with an electric
mixer on low to medium speed until combined, about 30 seconds.  Beat
on medium to high speed for 2 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl
occasionally. Add the remaining flour; beat for 2 minutes or until
mixed. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans.

For the topping, stir together the walnuts and sugar; sprinkle evenly
over the batter in the pans.  Bake in a 350 F oven for 40 to 50
minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center of each loaf
comes out clean. Cool the loaves in the pans on wire racks for 10
minutes. Remove the loaves from the pans.  Cool thoroughly on the
wire racks.

To Freeze:  Wrap each loaf tightly in moisture- and vaporproof wrap.
Seal, label, and freeze for up to 6 months.  To thaw, let stand,
loosely covered, at room temperature for 1 hour.  Or, to micro-thaw,
place 1 unwrapped loaf on a microwave-safe paper towel.  Microcook,
uncovered, at 30% power (medium-low) for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.

Makes 4 loaves, 8 servings each.

Pumpkin Oatmeal Bread

abm, grains/nuts

1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 cup fresh pumpkin puree or 8 oz. canned; pumpkin
2  eggs
3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon cloves
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
3/4 cup oats
1 1/4 cup self-rising flour
1  ***
1/4 cup ground walnuts

WARNING!  Cakes and quick breads (non-yeast) breads) may, at this time,
only be made in the Zojirushi, National SD-BT6N or Panasonic SD-T6P
machines.  Do not attempt making these in any other machines as the results
will fail.....
This recipe uses self-rising flour.  If substituting all-purpose flour,
add 1 1/2 tsp. of baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt for each cup of flour
used.  If you are using a National or Panasonic machine, all ingredients
are mixed together prior to placing in the pan for baking. Any ingredients
listed following asterisks are to be mixed in last and only until blended.
As you must tell the machine how long to bake the quick breads/cakes, the
times are given in each recipe.....
If using the Zojirushi, place the ingredients in the machine in the order
given.  Any ingredients listed following asterisks are to be added at the
"Beep".  As the machine is preprogrammed to turn off when the cakes/quick
breads are completely baked, you may ignore the baking times....
BAKE for 40 minutes.....
To prepare fresh pumpkin puree, simply cut pumpkin in half, removing
stem, pulp and seeds.  Cut pumpkin in to four to five inch squares and
place in boiling waater until soft and fork pierces easily. Drain off water
and puree pumpkin in food processor or blender.
Pumpkin is easily placed in ziploc bags, premeasured into one or two cups,
and keep frozen until required for baking....
PERSONAL NOTE From Ursula R. Taylor - I got the following note from
Sandy Hansen on NVN Food & Wine Board - note #110377.....Another way to
make pumpkin puree is to take the pumpkin and cut it in half, remove stem,
pulp and seeds also.  Then place it in the microwave and cook on high for
10 minutes.  Take it out with oven mits - as it will be very HOT.
Scrape out the soft flesh.  If it is still to hard, place back in
microwave for another 5 to 10 minutes.
Keep this up until all of the flesh has been scraped out. Place the flesh
in a blender and puree.  Will not heat up the house as bad this
way.....Signed Sandy in St. Louis...

Pumpkin Rolls

breadmachine, diabetic, low-fat/cal

1 pkg active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 f)
1/3 cup honey
2 tablespoon margarine
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup nonfat dry milk
1 cup canned pumpkin
1  about 1.5 tb pumpkin spice
1  or
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon cloves
3/4 teaspoon nutmeg
3/4 teaspoon ginger
2 1/2 cup to 3 cups all purpose flour
1 1/2 cup to 2 cups whole wheat flour
1  nonstick vegetable spray

1.  In a large bowl or food processor, dissolve yeast in water. Add
honey, margarine, salt, dry milk, pumpkin, spices. Beat well to
blend, then gradually beat in about 4 cups of the combined flours to
make a stiff dough.

2.  Turn dough out onto a floured board and knead until smooth about
15 to 20 min, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking.

3.  Turn dough over in a bowl coated with nonstick spray, cover and
let rise in a warm place until doubled (1 1/2 - 2 hours) Punch down
dough, knead briefly on a lightly floured board to release air.

4.  Divide dough into 24 equal pieces.  Shape each into a smooth ball
and place balls in 2 greased 9-inch round baking pans coated with
nonstick spray.  Cover and let rise until almost double.

5.  Bake in a preheated 375 F oven for 25 minutes or until browned.
Cool on racks.

Title: PUMPKINS: SELECT~ STORE & PUREE
Categories: Info/tips
Yield: 1 Servings


:          ***** NONE *****

Selecting and storing: Pass on the jack-o'-lantern variety (too tough
and stringy! ); for cooking, always choose a sugar pie pumpkina
smaller, sweeter variety with a finer flesh. Select a crack- and
soft-spot-free pumpkin with a rounded, dry stem. If the stem is
blackened or moist, move on. Store in a cool dry place, uncut, for up
to 1 month. If cut, wrap tightly and refrigerate up to 1 week. Buy
canned. It's an excellent alternative; just as pure, equally
nutritious, and so quick and easy!

Enjoying: Here's the simplest way to prepare fresh pumpkin: Rinse,
cut in half and scoop out seeds and stringy fibers. Place cut sides
down in a baking pan with 1/4 in. water. Bake at 350F about 45 min.
When cool, scoop out soft flesh and drain in a colander. Puree in a
food processor, then drain again thoroughly. Use immediately or
freeze up to 9 months in 1 c. containers for later use. (Even
simpler, open a can!) Spice up the autumn air; get out your favorite
pumpkin recipes, but reduce the fat: For pumpkin pie, use evaporated
skim milk, not cream, and egg substitute instead of eggs, and buy a
low-fat graham-cracker crust; for pumpkin bread, replace the oil with
half as much prune puree and use egg substitute; or brew a warm, cozy
pumpkin soup, using evaporated skim milk, not heavy cream! Slather
pumpkin puree (canned or fresh) mixed with molasses (to taste) on a
multigrain, nonfat toasted waffle for a nutritious breakfast, lunch
or after-school snack.-by Mary Nagle with Teresa Yeykal

1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
2 1/2 cup bread flour
2 teaspoon yeast

Put into breadmachine according to your manufacturer's directions.
This turns out GREAT in the breadmachine or baked in a conventional
oven. To bake in conventional oven, preheat to 400 degrees. Form
loaves and let rise a second time. Slash the loaves 5 or 6 times with
a sharp knife and brush with cold water. Bake in preheated 400 degree
over for 15 minutes and then lower the temperature to 350 degrees and
bake for 5 to 10 minutes or until golden brown and bread sounds
hollow when tapped. This bread turns crispy on the outside and moist
with a sourdough texture on the inside. Med. for 1-1/2 lb. loaf.

Raised Doughnuts ABM

breads, desserts

1/2 cup warm water
3  eggs
3 tablespoon unsalted butter; softened
2 tablespoon dry nonfat milk
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon mace
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cup flour
1 tablespoon yeast
1/2 cup powdered sugar

Place all the ingredients in the machine, program for knead and first
rise and press start. At the end of the final cycle, transfer the
dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and place
in a warm, draft-free place, and allow to rise for an additional 30
minutes. You can also do this step in the machine by punching the
dough down, closing the machine, and letting the dough rise for 30
minutes.

Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut it in half to
make it more manageable. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Roll it
out to 1/3" thick.  Flour a doughnut cutter and cut out doughnuts.
Lift each doughnut, pat it to remove excess flour, and place it on a
lightly oiled or sprayed baking sheet.  Cover the doughnuts with a
clean towel and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Put 1/2 cup powdered sugar in sturdy paper bag and spread out paper
towels near frying pan.  Heat 2" oil in a medium saucepan or deep
fryer to 375øF. Slide 2 or 3 doughnuts at a time into the hot oil.
Turn them frequently and spoon the hot oil over them until they are
well puffed. Drain the doughnuts on paper towels and shake them with
the sugar in the bag while they are still warm.

3/4 cup raisins
1 tablespoon cinammon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg

1 1/2 cup water; check during kneading

first when you add raisins the bread won't rise as high and when you
add bran or other types of flour bread won't rise as high.
I take it this recipe came with the book. I have made hundreds of
loaves of raisins bread and not one has been the same. I change
something each time. This is my favorite. I hope you like this. I
also like the sourdough raisin bread replace 1 cup of water with
starter also take 5 cardamom seeds and take out of pod add whole

1 tablespoon dry milk powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/8 cup water; warm
3 tablespoon yellow mustard
3 tablespoon sugar
3 tablespoon oil

Put water in the breadmaker pan.  Sprinkle yeast over top.  Sprinkle
sugar on yeast (this speeds up the proofing time).  Add oil.  Add
flour, milk powder and salt.  Add mustard.

Set breadmaker for dough and wait.

I find that the mustard makes the dough easier to handle and adds an
almost undetectable flavor to the dough. Makes great bread, too.

2 1/4 tablespoon margarine or butter
2 1/4 tablespoon molasses or barley malt
1 tablespoon grated fresh orange peel
1  (zest)
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cup whole wheat or rye flour
1  (your choice will affect
1  the taste - i prefer wheat)
1 1/2 cup high gluten bread flour
2 teaspoon dry yeast
2 teaspoon gluten (important!)
3 tablespoon buttermilk powder

THIS STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT!

Combine the first 7 ingredients (using FRESH seeds only!) in 1 1/3
cup of boiling water and soak for 1 hour minimum.  (This pre-soaks
the cracked wheat and pre-releases the other flavors.)

Dump this concoction into a bowl and add the remaining 6 ingredients.

Set your bread machine to White and bake at the medium setting...

Manual -- do the normal knead and rise tricks.  Bake at 350 F for 30
~ 35 minutes.  (test this since oven temps. vary)

The addition of the roasted peppers and the adjusted name change was by
Cindy Barton - *P ID#BVXF98A....
This is an absolute must with spaghetti or lasagna - an often requested
bread.  One you have this you'll never go back to plain, old garlic bread!
Several bread testers have "placed orders" for this when entertaining with
Italian meals.  (This was just above the recipe for Oregano Bread in the
cookbook.)
* my addition I added the roasted peppers at the beginning so I could
adjust the dough ball. Mine was a little too moist so it overproofed some,
but came out nice and chewy....probably BETTER THAT WAY! It made the most
incredible croutons the next day. Here's a great recipe that is even better
by adding ROASTED PEPPERS (you can buy roasted red peppers packed in oil in
glass jars in the supermarket....try them in meatloaf also!)

Roasted Red Pepper & Black Olive Bread

breads, italian

3  strips bacon; drained and coarsely chop
1 medium onion; peeled, halved and sliced
2 tablespoon olive oil
4  garlic cloves chopped ormore
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper; coarsely ground
3  roasted red peppers; seenote
1/2 cup nicoise olives, halved,pittd
2 tablespoon rosemary; fresh, chopped
4 1/2 cup bread flour; divided
2 pkg active dry yeast
2  eggs; beaten
1 cup parmesan cheese; grate fresh
1 cup water; heat to 120f degrees
      ----GLAZE ETC----
1 tablespoon cornmeal; for cookie sheet
2 tablespoon butter; melted

:       Seenote; lightly spray a ripe red pepper with release spray
and rub it around with your finger to coat the entire surface. Roast
the pepper directly in the flames of a gas stove, turning them with
tongs until the entire outside of the pepper is blackened. You do not
want to cook the peppers too much so do this as quickly as your range
will allow. You can also do this under a broiler, on the grill or
with any type of blowtorch, but my range is more handy..
:       In a large frying pan or skillet, cook the bacon over medium
heat until browned and crispy. Remove the bacon, drain on paper
towels and coarsely chop. Set aside. Add the onion to the reserved
bacon drippings along with the olive oil. Stir to coat the onions
evenly with the oil. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
until the onions are a golden brown, about 20 minutes. NOTE: in this
prior step it is important that the onions get browned and that most
to all of the liquid is fryed out.
Add the garlic and cook for 5 minutes more. Stir in the salt, pepper,
roasted red peppers, black olives and chopped rosemary. Stir in the
crumbled bacon. Set aside.
In the work bowl of a food processor, using the plastic dough blade,
combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and the sauteed onion/red pepper mixture.
Add the yeast, eggs and the parmesan cheese and combine thoroughly.
With the machine still running, add the water slowly until the
mixture begins to pull together and forms a ball. Note: that is
"begins to pull together", this will not be a rounded ball of dough.
If the dough is too sticky, add the remaining flour 1/4 cup at a
time. Process until the dough cleans the sides of the work bowl, then
knead for approximately 1 minute longer. The dough should be smooth
and elastic and bounce back when pressed with your finger. Place the
dough into a lightly oiled freezer type plastic bag, and put in a
warm place to double in volume, about 1 hour.(1 gallon bag for each
loaf, freeze one, and continue with the other.) Remove the dough from
bag and punch down, shape the dough into two oblong loaves, and place
on a lightly greased baking sheet that has been dusted with the
cornmeal. Make 3 or 4 decorative slashes in the top of the bread and
brush with the melted butter. Allow to rise again, in a warm, draft
free area until doubled, about 45 minutes. Place the dough into a
preheated 375F degree oven and cook for 35-45 minutes or until the
bread is golden and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped with your
finger. Place the bread directly on a wire rack to cool. This bread
freezes well for 2-3 months if tightly wrapped. To serve, defrost
overnight in the foil. To warm, place the thawed bread, still wrapped
in foil in a 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes. If reheated in this
manner, the bread will retain its freshly baked qualities.

Ron-Again's Rye Bread

breads

1/2 tablespoon yeast
1 cup rye flour
2 3/4 cup bread flour
1/3 cup sugar, brown
2 teaspoon caraway seed
1/2 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 cup water, warm

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

This is the best rye bread recipe I've ever made in the DAK R2D2. It
was given to me by Ron Lanning, and I think he may also have posted
it on the board. His recipe was for the small machine, and this my
adaptation for the larger ones.

It makes a very light, fluffy rye with a nice, domed top.

I find that my rye bread does better if I leave the dough a little on
the wet side. It will rise like crazy, so just before the bake cycle
starts, I press it down just a bit to keep it from collapsing during
the bake cycle.

Rosemary-Raisin Bread

fruits, breadmachine, brunch

1 pkg active dry yeast
3 cup unbleached bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon rosemary leaves
3 tablespoon sugar
2 1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoon lecithin
3/4 cup warm milk
1  whole egg
1  egg white
1/2 cup raisins

I adapted this from the Sunset Italian cookbook. It came out just
fine in the DAK. The original recipe calls for more olive oil (1/4 C)
if you are not watching fats, I bet it is wonderful that way.Cook on
white bread setting. I added raisins when around to it--I think it
was at the start of the second knead. Makes good sandwich bread or

1/4 cup water -- hot
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads -- crushed
1/2 cup 1% milk -- *note
1/4 cup sugar -- **note
2 tablespoon margarine, imitation --
1  ***note
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
1 tablespoon yeast -- +2 teaspoon
3 cup all-purpose flour --
1  unbleached
1  king arthur -- to 3 1/4
1  cups
1  topping:
1 large egg white -- beaten lightly
1 teaspoon water
1  pearl sugar

Combine the hot water and saffron, and let sit for 10 minutes to
soften the saffron. In a mixing bowl, beat together the saffron
water, milk, sugar, butter, salt, egg, yeast, 2 cups of the flour.
Add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead the
dough (for about 15 minutes by hand, 12 minutes in an electric mixer,
90 seconds in a food processor, or in your bread machine using the
dough cycle), then set it aside to rise till puffy (but not
necessarily doubled in bulk), about 2 hours. Punch the dough down,
and let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 16
pieces, and shape each piece into a ball. Place the balls fairly
close together (but not touching) in a 12-inch deep -dish pizza pan
or 9 x 13-inch pan, cover them, and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, or
until they're puffy. Glaze the buns with the mixture of beaten egg
white and water, then sprinkle them heavily with pearl sugar. Bake
them in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for 20 minutes, or until
they're golden brown. ( watch them closely at the end; because of
their high sugar content, they tend to brown quickly.) Serve with
butter or Devon cream. Yield: 16 buns.

Semolina Sesame Bread

abm

      ----BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----

1 1/2 tablespoon sugar

Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Semolina flour is the strong, silent type.  It has great tear (texture)
and character, but a mild flavor that does not announce itself. Its
understated nature lets this bread go anywhere with almost anything,
alongside an assertive French or Italian sauce, around juicy roast meat, or
under ripe cheese.

Seven Grain Bread

breadmachine

1 1/4 cup water
3/4 cup 7 grain mix
2 cup bread flour
1/2 tablespoon bread flour
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon molasses
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon powdered buttermilk
1 1/2 teaspoon yeast
1 1/2 tablespoon margarine

I bought a bag of "7-grain mix" (Stone-Burh) and came up with the
following recipe for the BM.  My goal was to come up with a "Poulsbo
Bread". This is very very close to the commercial product - only a
lot fresher tasting. About the only thing missing is sunflower seeds,
which I will try adding next time. I hope you like this. We ate an
entire loaf in one sitting (and there are only two of us!) Put
ingredients into pan in order listed. Bake at regular setting. One
more thing: this is a soft bread and will be difficult to slice when
hot. If you are going to use it in a sandwich, allow it to cool
first. Regards,   *** Gaye in Bellevue, WA *** 10/01 01:34 pm

This is what was in the book just before the recipe started: This is a
favorite of many of my testers, especially those who like French breads.
The recipe is simple but tasty, like those used by sheep herders in the
days of old.  Time this bread to be done right before dinner, then tear it
apart, rather than slice it, while still hot. Note that all-purpose flour
is used to give it an authenic texture.

Sicilian Pizza Dough

breadmachine, pizza

1 pkg dry yeast
3 cup all purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoon non-fat dry milk powder
1 tablespoon butter; at room temperature
1 1/4 cup warm water

Place all ingredients into breadmaker in the order listed. Allow
breadmaker to knead and let rise slightly before removing,
approximately 20 to 25 minutes.  Don't forget to remove the dough
before the bake cycle starts. NOTE: I use the DAK Autobakery on the
white bread setting to make this dough.  I then remove the dough and
place it on a lightly floured cutting board and cover with a clean
moist towel to rise an additional 30 minutes or so before forming to
the pizza tray.

Sour Beer Rye~ 1 1/2#

breads, abm

1 cup beer, flat, room temp
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1 1/4 cup bread flour
1 cup whole rye flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup gluten flour
1 teaspoon dill weed, dried
1 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
2 teaspoon caraway seeds
2 tablespoon oil
1 tablespoon honey
4 teaspoon active dry yeast

Combine the beer and the vinegar in a small bowl
and set aside for ten minutes.  This was wonderful
when I used a dark bock beer, much more flavorful
then when I used a low cost generic beer.  But the
bread is good no matter which brand that you use.
I substituted regular salt for the Sea Salt, with
no ill effects.

Add ingredients in the order specified by your
breadmaker.  Let cool on rack for at least one
hour after it has baked.

Put sour cream or yogurt, canola oil, and raisins in the baking pan of
your bread machine (see note at end) and add flour, brown sugar, cinnamon,
cloves and salt. If your machine has a separate dispenser for leavening,
spoon the yeast in there.  Otherwise, scatter it over the other dry
ingredients.  If the instructions that came with your machine call for
placing yeast in the bottom of the pan first thing, you need to remember to
reverse the order in which you add the liquid and dry ingredients.
Bake the loaf on your machine's quick cycle.
NOTE:  Or load machine according to your machines directions. If you
don't want smashed raisins - then add them at the right moment for your
machine - about 5 minutes before end of second kneading...

Sour Rye With Carraway Seeds

breads

1 pkg dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1 pinch of sugar
1 cup tepid water
2 cup starter
3 tablespoon carraway seeds
1 cup rye flour
1 cup gluten (can be purchased in gnc sto; res or other

health food places. It makes a difference in texture). Or see "joy of
Cooking" to make your own gluten.

Mix yeast, 1/4 cup tepid water and pinch sugar. Let dissolve and get
frothy. Then add all ingredients together, knead dough till smooth.
Let rise till doubled. Shape into two round loaves and let rise
again. Set a pan of boiling water 2" deep on the lower shelf. Bake at
425~ for 15 minutes, then lower temp to 350~ for another 30 minutes.
This can also be made in a breadmaker. Comes out fine. If you have a
smaller machine, halve the recipe. I just put all the stuff in the
machine, R2D2, hit the button, and let it go. Delicious. Freezes well
also. Hey guys, try getting a machine if you don't have one. Makes
breadmaking easy and quick. I could have done the job in the time it
took to type this.

If someone can't eat food with seeds in it, just toss the carroway
seeds into a blender or chopper and beat them to a powder and add to
mixture

Replace used starter with flour and water used, stir well, let sit
out a few hours and refrigerate. On and on.

Sourdough (Tc) Pizza Dough

breads, breadmachine

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 cup bread flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup sourdough starter
2 tablespoon water, if and as necessary

Watch the dough carefully and adjust the amount of water or flour if
necessary. Top with your favorite toppings.

Directions for Thin Crust doughs: Preheat oven to 500F for at least 30
minutes [I turn on the oven at the same time that I start the bread
machine ~-OLS] if using a pan and at least 1 hour if using a stone.
Grease the pizza pan with olive oil or spray it with a nonstick
vegetable spray. A light dusting of cornmeal to further prevent
sticking is optional - it usually adds a little crunch and flavor to
the dough. If using a peel and stone, dust the peel to prevent the
dough from sticking so that you may easily slide it off the peel and
onto the stone. While the dough is rising, prepare your topping and
grate your cheese; set aside. After the dough has risen 1 time, roll
it out on a lightly floured or cornmeal-covered (I prefer cornmeal)
countertop or handstretch the dough into a circle. Pick up the dough
and turn it over and roll or stretch from the center outwards until a
circle is formed. It may never be a perfect circle but that adds to
the uniqueness of your homemade pizza. Dust the dough only as needed
to prevent sticking with either flour or cornmeal. The thinner you
roll or stretch the dough, the thinner the crust. A thinly rolled
dough which does not rise a second time (after rolling) will give you
the thinnest, crispiest crust. Lay the dough on your prepared pizza
pan or peel. Pull the dough up around the edges of the pan so that a
slight lip is formed, and crimp the edges. For a thin, crispy crust,
place your toppings on the pizza and bake immediately. For a thicker,
chewier crust, allow the dough to rise for 15 to 30 minutes. The
longer the rise, the thicker the dough. Place your toppings on after
this second rising and then bake. The toppings should be placed in
such a way that the rim is left unadorned (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch
border is good). This prevents spillage when baking and gives a nice
piece of crust to hold when eating. Place the pizza on the bottom
rack of the oven or directly on the pizza stone and bake until the
crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted. If the oven was
properly preheated, it should only take 5 to 10 minutes to bake a
thin crust pizza.

PRECOOKED SHELLS - Make extra pizza dough, roll it out and place it
on the pan, screen or peel. Brush it with olive oil (or melted garlic
butter) and pierce the dough every 1/2 inch or so with a fork (to
prevent bubbles) [Note: The poking part is no joke, and not an
option, unless you *want* to pull a big puffy balloon out of the
oven. It's not as vital when you're topping the dough and putting it
directly in the oven. --OLS] Bake the shell in a preheated 500F oven
for about 5 minutes. Allow to cool, stack with waxed paper in between
[foil works fine for me], wrap it well in plastic and freeze for up
to 1 month. To use, remove dough from freezer (it is not necessary to
thaw but you may), brush dough with oil to prevent sogginess [I
haven't noticed any trouble without the oil], top as desired and bake
in a preheated 450F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.

If you want a very thin crust and end up with excess dough, simply
form it into bread sticks, brush with a little water and sprinkle
some kosher salt, poppy seeds or sesame seeds on top. Bake them right
beside your pizza. [Other options that I've tried with success: salt
and vinegar, garlic powder, and/or a little cayenne --OLS]

Sourdough French Bread #4

breads

2 1/4 cup bread flour
1 cup starter, at room temp.
1/2 tablespoon yeast (i use fermipan or red star)
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup tepid water (between 80 and 90 f)

I take the starter out of the fridge 4 to 8 hours before I plan to
start the bread. I feed it, then let it come up to room temp as it is
digesting the feeding (1/2 cup A.P. Flour and 1/2 cup water). To
start the bread, I measure everything but the water into the machine,
set it for French Bread, and turn it on. I then drizzle the water
into the machine slowly while it is running. That allows me to stop
before 1/2 cup is added, should the flour have absorbed a lot of
humidity from the air. For an extra crispy crust, I spray the dough
lightly with water during the final rise (after the loaf-forming
stage) and slash the top if I'm in the mood for a fancy look.

Rye Variation

Substitute 1/2 cup rye for 1/4 cup bread flour. Add 1 tsp caraway
seed. May need a Tbs or so extra water.

Sourdough Starter

This starter is from the Food Processor Bread Book by the Editors of
Consumer Guide. Published in 1980 by Simon and Schuster. ISBN
0-671-25201-1. I have been using and abusing this starter for years.

1 cup warm water 1 package active dry yeast 1/2 cup instant nonfat
dry milk solids 1/2 cup unflavored natural yogurt 1 1/2 cups all
purpose flour

1. Combine water and yeast in large glass bowl, crock or other
non-metallic container. Stir to dissolve yeast.

2. Add dry milk and yogurt to yeast mixture. Beat with whisk until
blended. Add flour and beat until smooth.

3. Cover bowl tightly*. Let stand in warm place (85F) until starter
has developed a sour aroma and is bubbly, 24 to 36 hours. Stir
occasionally.

4. Keep starter tightly covered in refrigerator. *

5. To use, stir and pour off as much as recipe requires. Replenish
remaining starter by blending in equal parts of flour and milk*. Cover
tightly and let stand at room temperature until bubbly. Refrigerate.
Starter should be used and replenished every two weeks.*

In case you are wondering about those asterisks. Those are places
where I have learned to depart from the stated instructions. BY NO
MEANS, should you ever store your starter tightly covered! This is a
great way to end up spending at least an hour cleaning your fridge. I
keep the starter in an old instant coffee jar which has had the
cardboard liner removed from the lid.

This leaves a bit of a space when you screw down the lid for gas to
escape. Even so, I don't screw down the lid all that tightly. I don't
waste bread flour on the starter, all purpose is fine. I also have
given up feeding milk to the starter, though I occasionally use whey
leftover from making yogurt cheese. I have left this starter in the
fridge unfed for up to six months and found only an inch of booze on
the top that smells like cheap sherry. I generally stir that down
with a dishwasher-safe plastic chopsticks and feed the beast. By next
morning it is happily bubbling and ready to use. You will note that I
feed first and then use. That way the starter can be doing something
while it's coming up to room temperature, which is the best
temperature to use it.

Sourdough French Bread For Breadmaker

breads, breadmachine

1/2 tablespoon yeast
2 1/4 cup flour, bread
1 cup sourdough starter; room temp
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup water; tepid

Put all ingredients except the water into the machine. Set it for
french bread and start it. Slowly drizzle the water into the machine
while it is running. Stop adding water when the dough forms a rough
ball that cleans the sides of the pan. There should be no wet slime
under the paddle. Let it knead for a while. The dough should get
smooth and satiny. Touch the dough ball. It's okay if it barely
sticks to your finger and feels tacky, but you finger should come
away clean. This dough, not having any fat or oil is always just a
hair stickier than normal white bread. It should not feel too dry. If
it is dry, add a few drops of water. Close the lid and let it do its
thing. After the loaf shaping stage you may mist the dough lightly
with water to give it a crispier crust.

Rye variation: substitute 1/2 cup rye flour for 1/2 cup bread flour.
Add 1 tsp caraway seed.

Note: Feed the starter and let it stand at room temp at least 4 hours
before starting the bread (usually over night) Store starter in the
fridge when not in daily use. I feed it with 1/2 cup all purpose
flour and 1/2 cup water.

Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comments: I wanted some sourdough
loaves to take to work for a party, and used this one. I shaped the
dough into 4 long ropes, which by the time they finished rising were
bigger than I wanted. :(  I baked them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes
with a pan of hot water on the bottom rack to get a good crisp crust,
then flipped them over and baked another 10 minutes to get the bottom
crisp too. Came out great!

Sourdough Peasant Bread

breads, breadmachine

      ----DONNA G BM COOKBOOK III----
1 1/8 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup water
1 1/4 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 cup bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoon yeast

This is for the medium sized loaf which, depending on how active my
starter is at the moment, will rise to the top of my Hitachi B101.

If I want an extra sour loaf, I will use the starter two or three days
after feeding. This produces a shorter loaf with a heavier texture.

For a light and fluffy loaf, I feed the starter first, then let it
sit on the counter for 8 to 10 hours before using. I make sure it is
very foamy when I put it in the B/M.

Sylvia's notes: I substituted some chopped olives and leftover turkey

but I give up; after several tries, I haven't been able to produce a
perfect loaf. If you don't mind cratered tops, the flavor's fine.

This is an especially nice version of sourdough because the sweet
raisins play off wonderfully against the sour. Another breakfast winner.
Bake according to manufacturer's instructions, adding the raisins during

Sourdough Starter

breads, breadmachine

4 cup lukewarm water
1 pkg activated dry yeast
1 tablespoon vinegar; very important<
1/4 cup sugar
5 cup unbleachd flour

Pour the water into a crock or a wide mouth gallon jar. Pour in the
yeast and let it dissolve. Stir. Add vinegar, sugar and flour. Mix.
Cover w/cloth and set in a warm place to sour..(2 to 3 days). When
activity STOPS, the mixture flattens out. An amber colored liquor
comes to the top..And it SMELLS.. THAT'S IT! Mix it up. It will look
like whipping cream. Put it in a GLASS JAR with a screw type lid;
place in refrigerator. IT WILL KEEP FOR MONTHS. Growing better as it
continues to age at a very slow pace. I have no idea regarding
conversion for use in BM. IF YOU DO.. Let ME know..Ho-Kay? It is
super in pancakes; waffles; coffee cake; rolled bisquits; quick drop
bisquits; cinnamon rolls; cobbler; BREAD; cake; oatmeal cookies;

Sourdough Starter & Bread

breads, abm, sourdough, starter

2 cup skim milk
2 cup bread flour
1 pkg yeast

Place milk in a glass container and allow to stand at room
temperature for 24 hours. Stir in flour and yeast. Leave uncovered in
a warm place for 2-5 days, depending on how long it takes it to
bubble and sour. If it starts to dry out, stir in enough tepid water
to bring it back to the original consistency. Once it has a good sour
aroma and is full of bubbles, it is ready to use. Try to maintain
about 1 and 1/2 cups of starter. Each time part of the starter is
used,

replenish with a mixture of equal parts milk and flour. Leave at room
temperature several hours or overnight, or until it begins to fill
with bubbles. Then cover and store in refrigerator. Starter is best
if used at least once a week. If starter isn't, used for 2 or 3
weeks, spoon out and discard about half and replenish as described.
Given attention, a starter becomes more flavorful with age. Starter
can be frozen if it is not to be used for several weeks. This will
slow down yeast action and should be left at room temperature for 24
hours after thawing. Sourdough Bread: 2/3 cup skim milk 1 cup
sourdough starter 3 cups bread flour 2 Tbs.sugar 2 tsp. lite salt 1 &
1/2 tsp. yeast 2 Tbs. liquid Butter Buds Combine above thoroughly
(using half of the flour) and let stand uncovered to ferment
overnight in a warm place. Next morning, after the mixture has risen
and fallen, stir down any crust that may have formed. Add the rest of
the flour. When thoroughly mixed, turn out onto a board covered with
a little flour so it won't stick. Shape dough into 2 loaves, put into
bread pans, brush lightly with liquid Butter Buds, and let rise
covered until almost doubled in size. Bake in a pre-heated 400F. oven
45-50 minutes. Note: This recipe works GREAT in a bread machine.
Simply put all of the ingredients in the machine, adding the dry
ingredients first. Yields: 2 loaves (24 slices)

Sourdough Starter (1 Of 2)

breads

1 x no ingredients

A true sourdough starter is nothing more than the flour and milk or
water which sits at room temperature for several days and catches
live yeast bacteria from the air. Most starter recipes today include
yeast as an original ingredient as it is much easier and less time
consuming. In addition, many sourdough bread recipes also indicate
usage of yeast itself as it does provide a higher rising, lighter
loaf.
A sourdough starter should be kept in a glass or plastic bowl which
has a tight fitting lid. I recommend a bowl instead of a jar as you
can "feed" your starter right in the bowl easily. To make your
starter, mix together: INGREDIENTS: 2 cup lukewarm milk
2    cup bread flour
2 1/2    tsp yeast (one package)
Mix the starter with an electric or hand held mixer on the lowest
setting. Cover your starter and place in a warm, draft-free location
for 4 to 7 days, gently stirring it once a day. You may notice that
the mixture bubbles and in some cases it may even overflow the bowl.
This is an indication that you have a healthy starter which should
simply be poured off and discarded.
If your starter ever changes colors, to purple, for example,
discard and start another one.
After allowing your starter to sit for 4 to 7 days it is ready to be
used. Take out whatever portion your recipe calls for and put into the
machine as you would any liquid ingredient. After removing a portion
from the starter, the starter must be "fed". Simply add equal
portions of milk or water and flour as was used. For example, if you
used 1 cup of starter, replace it with 1 cup of water and 1 cup of
bread flour.
Some hints on feeding your starter: always use the same kind of
flour. If you used bread flour in your original starter, use bread
flour to feed it. Also, alternate between milk and water for each
feeding. Since your original liquid ingredient was milk, the first
liquid feeding should be with water. If you forget which you used
last, that's okay, but try to alternate at least every other time.
After feeding your starter, let it sit at room temperature for about
one day and then refrigerate. =Continued=

=Continued=
Many cookbooks suggest stirring the starter once a day even when
being refrigerated; I find that it is not necessary. You must,
however, use a portion of the starter at least once a week. If you
choose not to bake sourdough breads that often, then remove a cup of
your starter and feed it as though you used some during the week. If
this is not done, your starter will turn rancid and have to be
replaced. Should you be away on vacation or otherwise not able to
tend to the starter, freeze it. Upon your return, thaw it in the
refrigerator and then remove a portion and feed it as soon as you are
able.
You may be thinking that this sounds too complicated, but it really
is not, nor is the starter overly fragile. A friend of mine had the
same starter for 14 years!
My first few loaves of sourdough were not very sour and I feared it
was my starter. After allowing the starter to mellow a little by
sitting in the refrigerator and using only once a week, it and the
breads became more sour.
Another hint is to put the bread in on the timer cycle for early
morning baking. The milk put in the night before adds a little more
sour taste. If the bread is getting too sour for you, feed with water
more often than milk. Source: The Bread Machine Cookbook by Donna

Sourdough Starter W/Vinegar

breads, breadmachine

4 cup lukewarm water
1 pkg activated dry yeast
1 tablespoon vinegar; very important<
1/4 cup sugar
5 cup unbleachd flour

Pour the water into a crock or a wide mouth gallon jar. Pour in the
yeast and let it dissolve. Stir. Add vinegar, sugar and flour. Mix.
Cover w/cloth and set in a warm place to sour..(2 to 3 days). When
activity STOPS, the mixture flattens out. An amber colored liquor
comes to the top..And it SMELLS.. THAT'S IT! Mix it up. It will look
like whipping cream. Put it in a GLASS JAR with a screw type lid;
place in refrigerator. IT WILL KEEP FOR MONTHS. Growing better as it
continues to age at a very slow pace. I have no idea regarding

Sourdough Thin Crust Pizza Dough

breads, breadmachine

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 cup bread flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup sourdough starter
2 tablespoon water, if and as necessary

Watch the dough carefully and adjust the amount of water or flour if
necessary. Top with your favorite toppings.

Directions for Thin Crust doughs: Preheat oven to 500F for at least 30
minutes [I turn on the oven at the same time that I start the bread
machine ~-OLS] if using a pan and at least 1 hour if using a stone.
Grease the pizza pan with olive oil or spray it with a nonstick
vegetable spray. A light dusting of cornmeal to further prevent
sticking is optional - it usually adds a little crunch and flavor to
the dough. If using a peel and stone, dust the peel to prevent the
dough from sticking so that you may easily slide it off the peel and
onto the stone. While the dough is rising, prepare your topping and
grate your cheese; set aside. After the dough has risen 1 time, roll
it out on a lightly floured or cornmeal-covered (I prefer cornmeal)
countertop or handstretch the dough into a circle. Pick up the dough
and turn it over and roll or stretch from the center outwards until a
circle is formed. It may never be a perfect circle but that adds to
the uniqueness of your homemade pizza. Dust the dough only as needed
to prevent sticking with either flour or cornmeal. The thinner you
roll or stretch the dough, the thinner the crust. A thinly rolled
dough which does not rise a second time (after rolling) will give you
the thinnest, crispiest crust. Lay the dough on your prepared pizza
pan or peel. Pull the dough up around the edges of the pan so that a
slight lip is formed, and crimp the edges. For a thin, crispy crust,
place your toppings on the pizza and bake immediately. For a thicker,
chewier crust, allow the dough to rise for 15 to 30 minutes. The
longer the rise, the thicker the dough. Place your toppings on after
this second rising and then bake. The toppings should be placed in
such a way that the rim is left unadorned (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch
border is good). This prevents spillage when baking and gives a nice
piece of crust to hold when eating. Place the pizza on the bottom
rack of the oven or directly on the pizza stone and bake until the
crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted. If the oven was
properly preheated, it should only take 5 to 10 minutes to bake a
thin crust pizza.

PRECOOKED SHELLS - Make extra pizza dough, roll it out and place it
on the pan, screen or peel. Brush it with olive oil (or melted garlic
butter) and pierce the dough every 1/2 inch or so with a fork (to
prevent bubbles) [Note: The poking part is no joke, and not an
option, unless you *want* to pull a big puffy balloon out of the
oven. It's not as vital when you're topping the dough and putting it
directly in the oven. --OLS] Bake the shell in a preheated 500F oven
for about 5 minutes. Allow to cool, stack with waxed paper in between
[foil works fine for me], wrap it well in plastic and freeze for up
to 1 month. To use, remove dough from freezer (it is not necessary to
thaw but you may), brush dough with oil to prevent sogginess [I
haven't noticed any trouble without the oil], top as desired and bake
in a preheated 450F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.

If you want a very thin crust and end up with excess dough, simply
form it into bread sticks, brush with a little water and sprinkle
some kosher salt, poppy seeds or sesame seeds on top. Bake them right
beside your pizza. [Other options that I've tried with success: salt
and vinegar, garlic powder, and/or a little cayenne --OLS]

Sourdough Upkeep

breads, info, sourdough

1  sourdough info

Recipe by: KKPD13B    Linda Caldwell As many of you know, I'm excited
about using Donna German's new book WORLDWIDE SOURDOUGHS FROM YOUR
BREAD MACHINE. the information in this book is of interest to "by
hand" bakers, too. Here's an example! "If the culture has not been
used in a month or so, it may require 1 or 2 feedings prior to using
to bring it back >>> up to its fast rising capacity. The more often
the culture is used, the faster it is, and the better it will rise.
1.Remove the culture from the refrigerator 2.Divide the culture in
half, placing each half in its own 1 quart wide mouth jar or plastic
container 3. Add 1/2 C warm (95f to 100f) water and 1/2 C white bread
flour to each of the cultures. 4. Place lid on jars but do not fasten
tightly. 5. Place jars in proofing box at 85f. Leave jars in proofing
box until foamy bubbles appear. This may take a few >>> hours or
from one to several days depending on how long the culture was
dormant. I'll put information on making a "proofing box" under its
own later. My starter's out on the kitchen counter and has just been
fed. Since it wasn't used for almost a month while I was away it may
take a while to get it ready to use. If it foams up soon, I'll make a
loaf today without the commercial yeast. It DOES take a while but is
very good. Linda in Birmingham *P SC          07/30/94  08:57:14 AM

Sourest Sourdough

breadmachine

1 1/4 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup water
3 cup bread flour
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon yeast

Set starter out on counter and bring to room temperature. Feed as you
normally do and allow to become foamy and active. This will take 8 to
12 hours.

Put all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle. When the
cycle is complete, remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a
damp towel and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes. (This rest period
makes the dough more pliable.)

Sprinkle corn meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical
loaves. Place loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet or in a
special "baguette pan" that can be purchased at a kitchen store.
Cover again with the damp towel and put in the refer for 12 to 24
hours. Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with water, and let it
sit out until the loaves are fully risen. (They will usually rise a
little in the refer, too.)

Spray again with water then bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown
and crusty. If you want a really crusty bread, spray the loaf with
water every five minutes while baking. This harder to describe than
it is to do ... and the results are worth it!

PLEASE NOTE: Depending on the temperature, humidity, and the whim of
the starter, the bread will vary from batch to batch. Sometimes it is
very sour and dense while other times it is mildly sour and fluffy
inside. Each batch is unique...but it is always good. I found that
using the special pan helped the baguettes keep their shape. The pan
is well worth the fifteen bucks. You can also vary the flavor of the
bread by using more or less sugar or by substituting 1 TBL of vinegar
for 1 TBL of water. Another variation is to use flat beer instead of
water in either the recipe or when feeding the starter.  (Be sure to
separate your starter into two batches first so that you do not
contaminate the orignal pot.)

Everytime I share this recipe, I get notes saying this is the beat

Spaetzli Or Spaetzle  (Egg Noodles)

breads, german, swiss

3 cup flour; unbleached
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
4  eggs; large, beaten
1/2 cup (or more) water
1/4 cup butter

Sift flour, salt and nutmeg together in a bowl.  Pour eggs and 1/4 cup
water into middle of flour mixture, beat with a wooden spoon. Add
enough water to make the dough slightly sticky, yet keeping it
elastic and stiff. Using a spaetzle machine or a colander with medium
holes, press the noodles into a large pot full of boiling salted
water. Cook noodles in the water about 5 minutes or until they rise
to the surface. Lift noodles out and drain on paper towels.  Brown
noodles in melted butter over low heat, and serve with a main dish.
Or, don't bother browning them, and serve in/with soup, or with stew.

(Another method for shaping the noodles is to spread the mixture on a
wooden board and cut off little pieces, dropping them in the boiling
water and fishing them out quickly when they're done.)

(Be prepared to write off your first few attempts at spaetzle, by the
way.) They are very labor-intensive, and a little miscalculation with
the time in the hot water can ruin them.

Spatzle

breads, pasta, ethnic

2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon farina (good luck finding this! i c; an't find it anywhere.)
2  eggs
1  water
1/4 cup butter, melted

From: Country Tastes: Best Recipes From America's Kitchens

This cross between noodles and dumplings was brought to the United
States by immigrants from Austria and Hungary.

In a medium-sized bowl, combine flour, 1 teaspoon salt and farina.
Blend in eggs and enough water to make a thick stiff dough. Bring a
pot of water to a boil and add remaining salt to it. Turn dough onto
a board. Cut into almond-sized pieces.  Drop into boiling water to
make dumplings. Or, press through a spatzle maker into boiling water.
After dumplings rise, cook 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from water
with a slotted spoon. Turn into a warm serving dish. Toss with melted
butter. Makes 4 servings.

Spelt Bread #1 Machine Made

breadmachine

1 tablespoon wonderslim
9 oz water
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup spelt flour
2 cup bread flour; white
3 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon active dry yeast; red star,
1  ; fleischmann's may
1  ; need more

Recipe by: Deborah Rech Original recipe called for 2 T butter or
margarine instead of Wonderslim.

I use the standard bread cycle, light crust setting.

This loaf is milder than whole wheat, but has more character than
white bread.  If you choose to use whole wheat flour (which I think
would overwhelm the flavor of the spelt), you would need to add a
little gluten to help the rise -- maybe one rounded tablespoon.

Spiced Sweet Potato Dinner Rolls

breads

3 cup bread flour
2 pkg rapid rise yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 large sweet potato; baked,peeled  and mashed
1/2 cup frozen egg substitute defrosted
3/4 cup hot skim milk (120 degrees)
1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour -glaze--
1  egg white; lightly beaten & mixed wi
1  sesame seeds; optional

Lightly coat a baking sheet with cookin spray and set aside. In a food
processor or heavy duty stand mixer, combine 3 c of the bread flour,
the yeast, salt, sugar, and pumpkin pie spice. Process until well
combined. Add the mashed sweet potato or pumpkin pack, and the egg
substitute. Process for 20 seconds. With the machine running, add the
hot skim milk. Process or knead to make a soft dough that isn't
sticky, adding more whole wheat flour in 1/4 cup increments as
necessary. Knead for 1 minute in a food processor, 10-12 minutes in a
mixer. The dough should be very smooth and elastic and bounce back at
you  when gently pressed with a finger. Place the dough into a
plastic bag that has been coated with vegetable spray, seal, and let
double in volume. Punch down. Pinch off a piece of dough about the
size of a small egg and shape with the palms of your hands into a
round. Place on the prepared baking sheet leaving about 1" between
each roll. Repeat with the remaining dough. Let double again. Preheat
the oven to 400 degrees. Brush the top of each roll with the egg
white glaze. Sprinkle the tops of the rolls with the optional sesame
seeds. Place on the middle rack of the oven. Bake 15 -20 minutes
until crisp and the bottoms sound hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire
rack. This bread freezes for about 3 months if tightly wrapped and
kept airtight. Note: Regular yeast can be substituted if the
RapidRise is unavailable. Please allow for a longer rising time when
using the regular yeast. If you buy your yeast in bulk (it is cheaper
this way) store in the freezer and allow approximately 2 to 2 1/2 tsp
per a single package measurement.

Spinach & Feta Bread Abm

breads

      ----BEST BREADMACHINE COOKBK EVE---
3/4 cup spinach, frozen chopped
2 1/4 teaspoon yeast
3 cup bread flour
1/3 cup wheat bran
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/2 tablespoon nutmeg, ground
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
3 tablespoon oil
1  eggs
1/3 cup feta cheese; crumbled
1/2 cup water

Defrost spinach overnight in refrigerator or microwave, but do not
cook. Wrap in dish towel or piece of clean old sheeting and tighten
fabric around spinach to squeeze out all the liquid.

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

The green spinach running through this bread makes it look like
marble. The loaf is moist yet dense and fragrant with nutmeg and
cheese. Meat loaf or cold lamb make excellent sandwich fillings, or
eat slices with chicken, egg-lemon, or beef and barley soup.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

2 tablespoon unsulphured molasses
1 each egg
2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup rye flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
2 tablespoon nonfat dry milk
1/2 teaspoon to 1 tsp. salt - to taste
1 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast

Measure the oats into baking pan of breadmaker and pour boiling water
over them.  Let stand until they are no more than warm to the touch before
adding other indredients - unless your machine has a separate dispenser for
the yeast, as otherwise the hot liquid will kill the leavening.
Spoon molasses into the mush, break in the egg, and add the all-purpose
and rye flours, the cornmeal, dry milk, salt, and following the
instructions given for your particular machine, the yeast.
Bake on full cycle.  Be sure you give yourself an extra 15 minutes or so
for this bread - to allow for the cool down period of the boiling water.

SOURCE: The Bread Machine Cookbook II by Donna Rathmell German,
copyright 1991, ISBN 1-55867-037-8.
Formatted into MM by Ursula R. Taylor.
Thanks to Lt. Morro, USN, for sharing a family recipe on which this is
based.
Fill with one of the fillings, according to the following instructions.
If you have a Panasonic SDBT6P or a National SDBT6N you may make some of
these on the Variety Bread Cycle.
This cycle enables you to remove the dough, place fillings into it and
replace it into the machine for baking. Follow directions given in your
owner's manual.
Owners of all other machines should make the rcipes on the dough
setting, remove, fill according to following directions and bake - in your
conventional oven. A small amount of flour may be used when rolling dough
to prevent it from sticking.
General Instructions for Stromboli:  Remove dough from machine and roll
into a rectangle.  Spread filling ingredients over the middle third of the
rectangle so it runs the length of the wide end.  Fold one side over top of
the filling and then the other side on top of that; pinch ends closed.
Place, seam side down, on a lightly buttered baking sheet, cover and let
rise for about 30 minutes.  Lightly olive oil top, and bake in a preheated
350~ oven for 20 to 30 minutes or until done.
DIRECTIONS for fillings:  Meat filling - mix all ingredients together.
Spinach filling:  Saute thawed spinach in olive oil and garlic powder until
all water has evaporated. Mix cheeses into spinach. Variation: substitute
1/2 or 1 bag of frozen chopped broccoli for spinach. Three Cheese Filling
or Sauce:  This is an excellent topping for pizza or a filling for calzones
or strombolli.  Don't forget - freshly grated Parmesan is always better
than pre-grated Parmesan.  Mix cheeses and eggs together until well
blended.  Add seasonings until just mixed in.

SOURCE: The Bread Machine Cookbook II by Donna Rathmell German,
copyright 1991, ISBN 1-55867-037-8.
Formatted into MM by Ursula R. Taylor.
Thanks to Lt. Morro, USN, for sharing a family recipe on which this is
based.
Fill with one of the fillings, according to the following instructions.
If you have a Panasonic SDBT6P or a National SDBT6N you may make some of
these on the Variety Bread Cycle.
This cycle enables you to remove the dough, place fillings into it and
replace it into the machine for baking. Follow directions given in your
owner's manual.
Owners of all other machines should make the rcipes on the dough
setting, remove, fill according to following directions and bake - in your
conventional oven. A small amount of flour may be used when rolling dough
to prevent it from sticking.
General Instructions for Stromboli:  Remove dough from machine and roll
into a rectangle.  Spread filling ingredients over the middle third of the
rectangle so it runs the length of the wide end.  Fold one side over top of
the filling and then the other side on top of that; pinch ends closed.
Place, seam side down, on a lightly buttered baking sheet, cover and let
rise for about 30 minutes.  Lightly olive oil top, and bake in a preheated
350~ oven for 20 to 30 minutes or until done.
DIRECTIONS for fillings:  Meat filling - mix all ingredients together.
Spinach filling:  Saute thawed spinach in olive oil and garlic powder until
all water has evaporated. Mix cheeses into spinach. Variation: substitute
1/2 or 1 bag of frozen chopped broccoli for spinach. Three Cheese Filling
or Sauce:  This is an excellent topping for pizza or a filling for calzones
or strombolli. Don't forget - freshly grated Parmesan is always better than
pre-grated Parmesan.  Mix cheeses and eggs together until well blended. Add
seasonings until just mixed in.

Sunflower Corn Bread

breads, abm

      ----INGREDIENTS----
3 3/8 cup flour, bread
1 1/2 tablespoon dry milk
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup cornmeal
1/3 cup seed, sunflower, raw
1 1/2 tablespoon molasses
1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil
11 1/2 oz water
1 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast

Directions:
Place all ingredients except yeast in baking pan.
Place yeast in receptacle.  Bake on Rapid Bake cycle or Timed Bake Cycle.
(Panasonic 65)
For other machines, place ingredients in pan in order recommended by
your machine and bake according to directions.
:          NOTE: This recipe adapted from a Panasonic recipe. The cornmeal
gives it a slightly coarse texture and the sunflower seeds provide crunch.
Excellent toasted with soups or salads. I sometimes substitute whole wheat
flour for one-half of the bread flour, making a slightly heavier textured
loaf.

Swedish Coffee Ring / Swedish Christmas Crown - Abm

abm, brunch, coffee-cake

      ----DOUGH----
3/4 cup water
2 large eggs
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 pinch saffron* or 2-3drops yellow
1  food coloring
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
4 cup bread flour
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoon bread machine yeast
1/3 cup chopped citron
1/4 cup chopped blanched almonds
3 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1  green & red candied cherries
      ----GLAZE----
1/2 cup 10x lemon flavored sugar
1/2 cup 10x sugar - plain flavor
1 tablespoon water + as needed

Place all the dough ingredients in the bread machine pan in the order
recommended by the manufacturer, EXCEPT the citron, almonds and lemon
peel.

Process on Dough/Manual cycle. DO NOT USE THE DELAY CYCLE. According
to your machine add the citron, almonds and lemon peel at the raisin
or nuts signal beep or 5 minutes before last kneading cycle ends.

Grease a large cookie sheet. (I prefer the air-cushion type as it
doesn't over brown the bottom of the bread.)

Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 30-inch rope on a lightly
floured pastry board. Place ropes close together on the prepared
cookie sheet. Twist the ropes over each other gently and then loosely
into a circle. Press the ends together to seal. Cover and allow to
rise in a warm place 45-50 minutes or until double in size.

Heat oven to 375 degrees F . Bake ring 20-25 minutes or until golden
brown; cool. Drizzle with Glaze. Garnish with cherries if desired.

Glaze: With a fork blend the sugars together. All of one flavor can
be used if desired.  Add water and mix until smooth and thin enough
to drizzle over the cake. Add or decrease water accordingly.

*To make a SWEDISH CHRISTMAS CROWN: After bread has cooled, make
holes for 6 candles in bread. Drizzle with glaze. Garnish with
cherries and insert candles.

A traditional Swedish favorite, this bread gets its distinctive flavor
from the combination of molasses, orange, and rye. It is a heavy, dense
bread.  Don't look for it to rise much, but it will have a wonderful rye
texture and flavor.

The Peace Maker

breads, main dish, seafood

1 cup rice
36  oysters
1  french bread loaf
1  butter, seasoning

Boil the rice and keep hot and dry. Cut off the top crust of the
bread. Hollow out the inside.  Fry the oysters.  Butter the inside of
the loaf well and place in the oven to brown.  Fill with the hot
fried oysters. The top of the loaf of bread may be buttered, toasted
and placed on the oysters to retain the heat, although the oysters
stay more crispy if served uncovered.  Serve on a platter with hot
boiled rice which is seasoned, dotted with butter, and garnished with
minced parsley and paprika. Yield: 6 servings. Note: A finely minced
clove of garlic may be used to flavor the butter. From Rice, 200

1 1/2 teaspoon barley malt syrup; (1 tsp),
3/4 tablespoon wonderslim; (1 t), *
1 1/4 cup water; (3/4 c + 2 t)

Recipe by: The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever, Madge Rosenberg

* The original recipe called for 1 1/2 T vegetable oil for the lg loaf and
1 T vegetable oil for the sm loaf.

Note:  The measurements in the (...) are for the small
1 lb loaf

Triticale is a nutritious grain that is a hybrid of wheat and rye.
You can find it in most health food stores. It adds to the taste but
not much to the rising of bread. In combination with wheat flour, it
makes good bread for sandwiches or toast, with a pleasant but
unobtrusive flavor.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine
manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions.

Varenyky (Filled Dumplings) (Russian)

breads, soups, ethnic

5 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter
1 cup evaporated milk; not condensed milk
1/2 cup ; water, as needed

Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl, forming a well in the
middle. Add the butter and milk and mix lightly until the flour is
absorbed. (Add a little warm water as needed.) Knead until the dough
sticks together, cover and allow to rest for a few minutes, then
knead until smooth. Cover and set aside.  (This dough should be
somewhat soft, since more flour will be added as the dough is rolled
out.) Or, in a processor, combine the flour, salt, and butter,
stirring a few times, then with the machine running, add liquids
until a ball forms. Allow to rest for a few minutes and then process
until smooth. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn, and
cover for about 30 minutes. (It may be wrapped in plastic and
refrigerated for a day or so, brought to room temperature and then
rolled out.) Place a fourth of the dough on a floured work surface,
re-covering the rest of the dough.  Roll into a circle, starting at
the center and rolling outwards to maintain an even thickness, turn
over and again from the center, roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch
thickness. Run a hand under the bottom to loosen it.  With a 3-inch
biscuit cutter or wine glass, cut into rounds. When done cutting,
place 1 tb of the filling on one side of each, flipping the other
half over the top and sealing with your fingers or a fork. Make sure
each is sealed or the filling will come out when cooked. Place each
of the dumplings on a floured cookie sheet, keeping the dumplings
covered with a towel.  Repeat with the remaining dough, saving the
scraps until last. Use as little flour as possible in this process or
the scraps will be come tough and heavy.  Gently drop 12 to 15
varenyky into 3 quarts of boiling water, in a large wide pot or Dutch
oven. Do NOT overcrowd. Stir and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain
in a collander and place on a lightly oiled cookies sheet, shaking to
coat with a thin film to prevent sticking. Do NOT pile the dumplings
on top of each other as this distorts their shape. If the varenyky
are to be frozen, remove with a slotted spoon when they float to the
top. DO NOT overcook. To freeze. place in the freezer on an oiled
cookie sheet when tepid (lukewarm). When they are rigid, store in
tightly sealed plastic bags. TO SERVE: Varenyky may be poached,
pan-fried or steamed, served as an accompaniment or meats or served
with sour cream, chopped sauteed onions or fried bacon with a little
bacon fat.

Walnut-Onion Herb Bread

breads, breadmachine

1 1/4 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 tablespoon sugar
1 cup warm water (105-115)
1 cup warm milk (105-115)
1  egg
2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon walnut oil or unsalted buttr
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
1  or
1 1/2 tablespoon dried dill
4 1/2 cup flour
1/3 cup minced white onion
2/3 cup coarsely chopped walnuts

*This recipe is for making bread in a casserole dish with no
kneading. To make it in a bread machine cut liquid and flour in half.
In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast and a pinch of sugar over the
warm water. Stir to dissolve and let stand until foamy, about 10
minutes. In a large bowl, combine the mild, remaining sugar, egg,
salt, oil or butter, dill and 1 1/2 cups flour. Beat with a wisk or
heavy duty mixer until smooth. Add the yeast mixture and remaining
flour 1/2 cup at a time, beating vigorously about 2 minutes. Batter
will be sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm area
until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Sprinkle the onion and walnuts
over the top of the batter and stir down, beating vigorously to
evenly distribute. Turn into a well greased 3-quart casserole or
souffle dish, 9-inch springform pan, or 9-inch kugel of tube mold.
Cover loosley with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm area until
doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
Bake in the center of the oven until the top is crusty brown, hollow
when tapped and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out
clean, about 45-50 minutes. Run a sharp knife around the sides of the
pan and turn out of the pan onto a rack to cool right side up.
Variation: add 4 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into cubes. *For Bread
machine, dump in all ingredinets and push start.

What Is Gluten

breadmachine, info

1 x no ingredients

-PETER PARK JR   (VNKJ85A)

Let's clarify the distinction between GLUTEN and the DEVELOPING of
Gluten through mixing and kneading (what Jackie calls "making
Gluten"):

++  GLUTEN (also called 'VITAL GLUTEN') is one of several components
of the wheat berry that is milled to make flour. It is high in
protein and contributes to a lighter bread, higher rise, and
IMPORTANTLY for those of us at high altutude, an elastic quality that
reduces the liklihood of a rising loaf falling (like a balloon
bursting because the rubber won't stretch anymore) -- GLUTEN gives
the dough more stretch.

++  DEVELOPING THE GLUTEN (what Jackie describes) is the result of
mixing and kneading that results in the elastic properties described
above being developed in dough from Gluten in it. By hand kneading,
or by kneading in an automatic breadmaker, the elasticity that Jackie
described develops ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT GLUTEN IS PRESENT in the
flour.

++  Various flours have more or less GLUTEN present -- All flour has
some GLUTEN (or VITAL GLUTEN) -- Bread Flour has considerably more
Gluten -- this is good for bread making and bad for cake making and
other uses (which is why there are other types of flour (e.g. ALL
PURPOSE FLOUR) ++ The ADDITION of GLUTEN (VITAL GLUTEN) beyond what
is already in the flour is for several reasons: -- It is added to ALL
PURPOSE flour to give it the GLUTEN amount already in BREAD FLOUR.
For some this is economics, since ALL PURPOSE FLOUR with Gluten added
is often cheaper than BREAD FLOUR.
-- It is added to BREAD FLOUR to give extra rise and consistency
(that is why bakers use it) -- It is added at high altutudes to
provide extra elasticity. The chemical reason has to do with reduced
density (pressume) at high elevations which causes the 'bubble' of
rising bread to [fall] if the dough lacks extra elasticity. ADDED
Gluten is nice for some - critical at high Alt.

++   GLUTEN (or VITAL GLUTEN) is available at health food stores for
use for the reasons noted above.
-- Many health food stores have it in bulk -- Most also have it in
boxes especially ARROWHEAD MILLS IN A 10 oz box ($ 2.19 to $2.69

Recipe by: Dak recipe
I just made this bread using peanut oil instead of butter and it
probably is one of the best breads I've made. It had good flavor and
great texture. It sliced very well and didn't fall apart like the
bread can sometimes.

breadmachine, brunch

1 pkg (5/16-ounce) yeast
1 1/2 cup 50/50 flour
1/2 cup bread flour
2 tablespoon cracked wheat cereal
2 tablespoon wheat germ
2 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 tablespoon dry milk
1 teaspoon salt
7/8 cup water

50/50 FLOUR IS MADE BY HODGSON MILLS AND FOUND IN WHOLE FOODS.
Put all ingredients, in the order given into the bread pan, select
WHITE bread, and push Start.
NOTE: Using 50/50 flour ensures that your whole wheat bread will be
substantial, but not heavy. You'll love the crunchy texture and the
nutty, whole grain taste of this bread.
NOTE #2: For a less crunchy loaf, soak the cracked wheat in 1/4 cup
boiling water for 5 minutes. Decrease the water in the recipe to 5/8
cup.

Whole Wheat Bagel Bread From

breadmachine, jewish

1 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoon gluten
3 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon honey warm water

If you don't like making bagels but want the texture of bagels with
the low-fat nutritional benefits; try this bread. It tastes like a
bagel and is especially good sliced and toasted.

There is one note for the Panasonic/National machines and that is to
use 3 tsp yeast for 1 1/2 lb loaf.  I believe that this is for the
older Panasonics as I do remember Linda Rehberg saying that the newer
models came out after their book was published and that the yeast
amounts in her book were not for the newer Panasonics. Upon
re-reading I found I missed one thing. I did add a few more tsps of
water as the dough ball was not forming to my liking.  Let me know if
you make this and how you like it.

that point. If it is not, add additional liquid one tablespoon at a
time until it is.

3/4 cup oats (i use quick oats)
3/4 cup whole wheat flour

1 1/2 teaspoon yeast
1/2 cup chopped dates
1/2 cup chopped almonds

The dates and almonds can be added at the beep, but I usually add
them at the very beginning for better distribution. We like this
spread with cream cheese, but it's also good just as it is! I always
keep the machine open at the very beginning kneading and add flour by
the tablespoon as is neaded until it's no longer sticky. Living in a
high humidity climate sometimes I need to add quite a lot when I
don't cut down the liquid. Guess I should be keeping an eye on the
humidity before I begin baking! Thanks for your recipe.  We used to
live near Lancaster. Rhonda

2 cup whole wheat bread flour

1 tablespoon gluten
1 tablespoon lecithin granules
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon salt; - (i use light salt)
1/2  ctn  eggbeaters; - or one egg - at room te
3/4 cup non-fat cottage cheese
3/4 cup plain non-fat yogurt
3 tablespoon sugar
3 tablespoon onion; minced dried
2 tablespoon whole dill seed
1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil; - or butter

Warm together the water; cottage cheese, yogurt, sugar, onion, dill
seed and oil in microwave for about 30 seconds or until warm to the
touch (about 110 deg). Set aside. Place all other ingredients above
into the bread pan in order listed. Add warmed ingredients. Select
white bread setting (other brands of B/M's may have a whole wheat
setting), but the white bread setting works on the DAK. Set
light/dark setting on side of B/M to 11 o'clock. Press Start. Open
lid after dough has kneaded about 2 mins. Press dough lightly with
fingertip. If wet, sticky dough adheres to your fingertip OR dough is
not forming into one soft ball (NO sticky dough on bottom of pan),
add 1 Tablespoon or more flour until dough is just slightly tacky and
makes one soft ball of dough. Judy Garnett --- Hope this does well
for you. I use my elec. knife to slice the bread top to bottom down
the center first. Then place the two cut sides down and slice them
thin. This makes a great sandwich bread or is good toasted with a
little diet margarine spread.  Best regards, Judy Garnett 11/07 11:18

recipe has no sugar at all...wonder why!? My Panasonic machine has a
setting for making  Whole Wheat Bread and this recipe is for making
the Whole Wheat Irish Soda Bread that I tried yesterday.  It was a
big hit!! BETTIE COOPER (VGXB82A)

Whole Wheat Molasses Bread

breadmachine, rolls

      ----INGREDIENTS FOR SCRATCH REC----
2 3/4 cup whole wheat flour
2 cup better for bread flour
2 pkg yeast
1 3/4 cup water; warm
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon caraway seeds
2 tablespoon shortening
      ----FOR BREAD MACHINE----
1 pkg yeast
1 3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup better for bread flour
3 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon caraway seeds
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup water; very warm
1/4 cup molasses
1 tablespoon shortening; melted

For Bread Machine:  Put the ingredients into the pan in the order
given. Select white bread. Choose high crust setting. Push Start.
This is a very moist cake-like bread, and one of our favorites. Makes
1 loaf. Scratch Method: Combine whole wheat flour and 1 cup of the
Better for bread flour, yeast and Caraway seed. Heat the water,
molasses, brown sugar, shortening and salt, just till warm, stirring
to melt the shortening. Add to the dry mix.  In an electric mixer,
beat at low speed for 30 seconds, then on high speed for 3 minutes.
Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough. Knead
the dough until smooth and elastic. Shape in a ball and let rise in a
greased bowl, until doubled. I speed up the rising by placing the
bowl of dough in the overn with the light turned on. Punch the dough
down and divide in half.
Shape in 2 loaves. Let rise on a greased baking sheet, until double.
Bake at 375 degrees 30 to 35 minutes. If you like the crust really
chew, brush the bread with warm water during the last 10 to 15
minutes of the baking. Remove from the sheet and cool on racks. Makes
2 loaves I have made this bread for many years. It is almost like
eating cake! My husband said he couldn't tell the difference between
when I made this from scratch, and making it in the bread machine.

Whole Wheat Skyscraper Bread

abm, yeast bread

1 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon powdered milk
3 tablespoon olive oil
4 tablespoon molasses
4 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cup hot tap water
1 tablespoon bread additive*

12-serving recipe is for "3-cup" or 1.5 lb. machine.   To convert to 1 lb.
machine, tell your recipe management software to convert for 8 servings.

This recipe produces  a tall, pan-filling loaf of 100% whole wheat bread
that's springy in texture.

Recipe adapted by Linda Shogren (TEECH) from an Atari recipe posted by
T.FOX5 (Joe Ekaitis).

* "Bread additive" will improve the texture of whole-grain breads and make
them rise better.  You can buy this from pricey cooking stores (i.e.
Williams Sonoma or King Arthur), or make your own.  It is very simple and
MUCH less expensive.  Mix equal parts of vital gluten (from health food
store), ascorbic acid crystals (from drug store/pharmacy) and diastatic
malt powder (from health food store).  Stores indefinintely in a tightly
closed  container on the cupboard shelf.  I usually make up about a pint at
a time.

When making whole grain breads, use about 2 tb per loaf, adding it to the
measuring cup before you fill it with one of the cups of flour, and then
procede as usual.

You can even make your own malt by sprouting whole wheat berries until the
sprouts are about 1/4" long, drying the sprouts, and then grinding them to
a powder in a blender or grain mill.

Enjoy! Linda

Whole Wheat Sourdough

breads, breadmachine

2 teaspoon yeast
2 cup whole wheat bread flour
1 1/3 cup unbleached bread flour
2 tablespoon buttermilk powder
2 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
2 tablespoon lecithin
2 teaspoon salt; lite
2 teaspoon wheat germ
1/2 teaspoon ginger
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 cup whole wheat s/d starter (you
1 cup water; (i use bottled h20)
1/2  margarine, room temp.

I used the whole wheat starter and experimented with your whole wheat
bread recipe in the DAK today. It turned out great. Basically, I just
halved your recipe and added a few things. My DAK is a 3 cup flour
model, is yours? If I'm using whole wheat or rye flour, I can add
more flour because it doesn't rise as much.  Also, whenever I use
whole wheat, etc. I add vital wheat gluten and lecithin to aid
elasticity and to help it rise. This is what I put in the DAK and the
order I used: Turn the light/dark setting to 12 o'clock and set the
menu to Sweet Bread (the auto. one, not the manual one) Later, at the
beeps, I added 3/4 c. pecans (didn't have walnuts on hand). I usually
add large pieces since they are kind of cut up by the B/M while knead
ing. We can keep experimenting with this....let me know if you try it
and what you add or subtract. Have you ever added raisins, oatmeal or
any kind of seeds? The B/M gives me the lazy way out, and I wanted to
see what it would do in it.  Thanks so much for taking precious time
to post the recipe. P.S. I have some of the beer s/d starter to give
you when we get together, but the whole wheat starter is GREAT!.

Yogurt & Pumpkin Bread

breads

      ----1 1/2 LOAF----
3 teaspoon red star active dry yeast
3 cup bread flour plus 4 tb
3 tablespoon wheat germ
3 tablespoon powdered milk
3 teaspoon gluten
3 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup pumpkin
1/3 cup plain yogurt
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup raisins
1/3 cup chopped pecans

This recipe works well in the Hitachi 101.  Other machines should make
ingredient adjustments according to their manufacturers suggestions.

Have all ingredients at room temperature.  Warm water, pumpkin, and
yogurt in microwave for approx. 60 seconds. Because the pumpkin is
very dense, additional heating may be necessary.

Depending on humidity, an additional teaspoon or so of flour may be
necessary. (check after 5 mins, if dough is too wet, add flour. Then
check again after rest cycle, and kneading begins) If necessary add a
little more flour. This dough is slightly sticky compared to some
other breads.

Add all ingredients in order recommended by manufacturer. For the
Hitachi add the pecans and raisins about 12 mins into the mixing
cycle. (If I wait until the beeper, they don't get mixed in too well).

Set on mix cycle, and light crust.

This recipe makes a dense, small loaf, with much the consistency of a
bagel, but very good.  It is a cross between pumpkin pie and raisin
bread.
