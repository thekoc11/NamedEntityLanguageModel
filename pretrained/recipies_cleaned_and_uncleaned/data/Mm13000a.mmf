      1 tb Worcestershire sauce           
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
  Melt the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, 
  celery, bell peppers, green onions, garlic, tabasco, Worcestershire and 
  seasoning mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking excessively, about 6 
  minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the pan bottom well. Stir in 
  the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, stirring 
  occasionally. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to room 
  temperature.
  Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Add 
  the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the 
  bay leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the 
  pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6 
  inches wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F for 25 minutes, 
  then raise heat to 400F and continue cooking until done, about 35 minutes 
  longer. Serve immediately as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef.
  This is best using both ground pork and ground beef, as the pork gives 
  more flavor diversity. However, you can make it with ground beef only.

      Title: Roasted Garlic
 Categories: Garlic, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  Whole Heads Of Garlic               1 x  Softened Sweet Butter
      1 x  Toasted Rounds French Bread    
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
  Remove the papery outer covering of whole garlic head, but do not seperate
  the cloves or peel them.  Place as many whole heads of garlic on a large
  square of heavy-duty aluminum foil as there are people to be served.  Fold
  up foil so that the cloves are completely wrapped.
  Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 15 minutes.
  Serve each diner a head of garlic and some bread and butter.  Separate
  cloves.  Hold a clove over a piece of buttered bread and squeeze.  The
  garlic puree will pop out, like toothpaste from a tube.  Spread and eat.
  GARLIC PUREE:
  To make a batch of Garlic Puree for later use, let roasted heads of garlic
  cool, unwarapped for at least 5 minutes.
  Gently separate the cloves and squeeze each one over a fine meshed sieve,
  so that the softened garlic pops into the sieve.
  With wooden spatula or wooden spoon, rub garlic through the sieve into a
  small container or bowl.
  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the puree if needed.
  QUICK PUREE:
  If you are in a hurry, you may skip the refinement of the sieve.  Simply
  squeeze the cloves, one by one, over a bowl.  When they have all been
  squeezed, use a rubber spatula to push the puree into a neat mound cover
  tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until needed.  It will keep for
  months.  To keep indefinitely, cover with a film of olive oil.

  Now, I said above that this makes 48, I've never counted, so I
  don't know for sure.  But it sure does make a bunch.  The main
  reason why I said 48 is because the program, MenuMaster, won't
  let you past that field unless you tell it something.
  Justin Wilson says, "Hush puppy is an old Southern term that
  originated after the Civil War.  People didn't have enough for
  themselves to eat let alone feed their dogs, so when the old
  hounds started barking from hunger, they would throw pieces of
  fried corn bread to them, yelling, 'Shut up, dog!  Hush puppy!"

  firm-fleshed seafood or fish for the char.
  Melt butter in a cast-iron or heavy-bottomed frying pan over
  medium high heat.  Add Cajun spice and heat thoroughly.  Place
  fillets in pan.  Squeeze juice of one lemon into pan.  Cook
  fish for about 5 minutes on each side.  Serve with remaining
  lemon wedges and pan drippings.

  Lafayette Louisiana go to Prejeans, one of the nicest Cajun
  restaurants around.  They serve a great bread pudding there,
  maybe you can talk them into giving you their sauce recipe.

      Title: Smothered Round Steak
 Categories: Cajun, Beef
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Round steak                       1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      2 ts Salt                                3 ea Medium onions, chopped
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper                 2 ea Bell peppers, chopped
      1 ts Ground red pepper                   1 ea Celery rib, chopped
      1 ts Ground white pepper                 1 c  Beef stock or water
      1 x  All-purpose flour (dredging)   
 
  Alex Patout says, "Smothering is a multipurpose Cajun technique
  that works wonders with everything from game to snap beans.  It's
  similar to what the rest of the world knows as braising--the
  ingredients are briefly browned or sauteed, then cooked with a
  little liquid over a low heat for a long time."
  Season the roast with one half of the salt and peppers.  Dust with
  flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or other large
  heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the steak, and brown well
  on all sides.  Remove the meat and pour off all but 1 teaspoon
  of the oil.  Add half the onions, bell peppers, celery, and the
  other half of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well
  and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point.  Return the
  roast to the pot and cover with the remaining vegetables.  Cover
  and let cook until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15
  minutes.
  Serve the meat in slices, with rice alongside and the gravy over
  all.
  When you try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be sure to
  adjust the cooking times accordingly--let tenderness be your guide.
  For extra flavorful roasts, try larding with slivers of garlic
  before smothering.
  Serves 4-6

      Title: Patout's Boiled Crawfish
 Categories: Cajun, Fish/sea
      Yield: 8 servings
 
--------------------------------FOR THE BOIL--------------------------------
     40 lb Live crawfish                     1/2 c  Ground black pepper
      1 c  Salt                                5 lb Small white onions
    1/2 c  Ground white pepper                12 ea Ears of corn, shucked
    1/2 c  Ground red pepper                   5 lb Small new potatoes

----------------------------------SPRINKLE----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Ground white pepper               1/2 c  Ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Ground red pepper                   2 c  Salt
 
  Alex Patout describes Crawfish as "a delicacy made for sharing--
  in fact, in Cajun country, boiling crawfish for only two people
  counts as a venial sin."
  Wash the crawfish well and pick out any fish bones or other
  debris.  Fill a great big (40-quart) Stockpot a quarter full of
  water.  Add the salt and peppers and bring to boil.  Add the whole
  onions, the corn, and the new potatoes (it will be easy to remove
  them later if you put them in a cloth sack).  Return to boil, cover,
  lower heat to medium, and let cook for 8 minutes.  Add crawfish,
  cover again and raise heat to high.  After steam begins to escape
  from under the lid, cook 7 minutes more.  Remove from heat and
  let sit for 4 minutes.  Do *NOT* remove the lid until this point!
      Remove the onions, corn, and potatoes to a bowl and drain the
  crawfish.  Place the crawfish in a large insulated container (an
  ce chest works well, as do the thick waterproof boxes chickens
  are shipped in, which your butcher may give you for free).  Have
  your *SPRINKLE* ready and sprinkle over the crawfish and mix them
  well to coat.  Cover and let sit for 7 minutes.
      Serve immediately with the onions, corn, new potatoes, and
  lots of French bread on a large table covered with plenty of
  paper.  When everyone has eaten his fill, everyone "peels for
  the house."  The peeled tails can then be used in cold crawfish
  cocktail or salad or for Fried Crawfish the next day.
  Serves 8-10
  NOTE:  Most of the salt is not added until after the cooking
  process because too much salt added during cooking makes the
  flesh of the crawfish adhere to the shell.

      1 qt Water                             1/2 ts Ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil                       1 tb Fresh thyme or 2 t dried
      3 ea Med. yellow onions, chopped         1 tb Fresh basil or 2 t dried
      2 ea Large bell peppers, chopped     1 1/2 ts Sugar
      5 ea Celery ribs, chopped fine           5 ea Bay leaves
     10 ea Lge. tomatoes, peeled&seeded        1 c  Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Salt                                1 c  Parsley, chopped
      1 ts Ground red pepper              
 
  Peel and devein the shrimp.  Place heads (if you have them), and
  peels in a small saucepan and add the water.  Bring to a slow boil
  over medium-high heat and let boil slowly for 15-20 minutes.  Strain
  and discard the heads and peels.
     Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place
  over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, peppers, and celery and saute
  stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes.
  Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar, and shrimp stock
  and return to simmer.  Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for
  2 hours, stirring occasionally,  This is your creole sauce; it can
  be prepared 1 or 2 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator
  (I find the sauce is even better after sitting a couple of days in
  the refrigerator).
     When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and
  add the shrimp.  Cook until they turn pink, 5-7 minutes.  Stir
  in the green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more.
  Serve on flat plates over beds of rice.
     Serves 6-8.
  SHRIMP AND HAM OR TASSO JAMBALAYA:
  Prepare Shrimp Creole as above, but add about a pound of cubed ham
  and a 4-ounce can of tomatoe sauce to the finished sauce and simmer
  45 minutes more.  Meanwhile, boil or steam 2-3 cups raw rice.
  Finish the sauce (which will be your jambalaya base) by adding
  the shrimp, green onions, and parsley as above.  (If you are using
  leftover Shrimp Creole, remove the shrimp and reheat the sauce,
  add the ham and tomato sauce, and proceed as above.  Return the
  shrimp to the pan at the end of cooking.)  Place the hot, cooked
  rice in a large bowl, pour the jambalaya base over, mix well, and
  serve.
     You can also prepare this dish with sausage instead of ham.

 Categories: Cajun, Fish/sea
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 ea 8-10oz redfish fillets            3/4 lb Unsalted butter, melted

-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
      1 tb Sweet paprika                     3/4 ts Ground white pepper
  2 1/2 ts Salt                              3/4 ts Ground black pepper
      1 ts Onion powder                      1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
      1 ts Garlic powder                     1/2 ts Dried oregano leaves
      1 ts Ground cayenne pepper          
 
  NOTE: Fish fillets (preferably redfish, pompano or tilefish) cut
  about 1/2 inch thick.  Redfish and pompano are ideal for this
  method of cooking.  If tilefish is used, you may have to split
  the fillets in half horizontally to have proper thickness.  If
  you can't get any of these fish, salmon steaks or red snapper
  fillets can be substituted.  In any case, the fillets or steaks
  must not be more than 3/4 inch thick.
  Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat until it is
  beyond the smoking stage and you see white ash in the skillet
  bottom (the skillet cannot be too hot for this dish), at least
  10 minutes.  (FT - this recipe is *NOT* for the faint of heart)
     Meanwhile, pour 2 Tablespoons melted butter in each of 6 small
  ramekins; set aside and keep warm.  Reserve the remaining butter
  in its skillet.  Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.
     Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
  Dip each fillet in the reserved melted butter so that both sides
  are well coated; then sprinkle seasoning mix generously and evenly
  on both sides of the fillets, patting by hand.  Place in the hot
  skillet and pour 1 teaspoon melted butter on top of each fillet
  (be careful, as the butter may flame up).  Cook, uncovered, over
  the same high heat until the underside looks charred, about
  2 minutes (the time will vary according to the fillet's thickness
  and the heat of the skillet).  Turn the fish over and again pour
  1 teaspoon butter on top; cook until fish is done, about 2 minutes
  more.  Repeat with remaining fillets.  Serve each fillet while
  piping hot.
     To serve, place one fillet and a ramekin of butter on each
  heated serving plate.
  I had this in K Pauls Restaurant in New Orleans.  It is a taste
  experience you will never forgive yourself for missing should you
  ever be lucky enough to find yourself in N'awlins and you don't
  go to K Paul's and order this.  Even people who don't like fish
  love this dish.

      Title: Hot Chicken Wings
 Categories: Cajun, Appetizers, Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Chicken wings                       6 oz Hot sauce or Tabasco
      1 x  Oil for frying (optional)         1/2 c  Melted butter
 
  Cut the chicken wings in two at the joints.  In a large frying

  cover the chicken wings.  Add the wings and fry until crisp,
  about 12-15 minutes.
     To bake, preheat the oven to 450F.  Spread the chicken wings
  out on a baking sheet in one layer and bake 45 minutes.
     To make the sauce, combine the Hot Sauce or Tabasco and melted
  butter and blend thoroughly.  As soon as the chicken wings are
  cooked, douse with the sauce, and serve immediately.
     Serves 2-6
  Nathalie Dupree's "New Southern Cooking"
  Nathalie says, "These little wings make a good meal for two or are
  a great appetizer.  Up North, they are called Buffalo wings and are
  served with celery and blue-cheese dressing.  The little wing tips
  should be trimmed off to make neater pieces.  But I cook them along
  with the wings and save them for myself.  I call them the "cook's
  treat."  You may fry or bake the wings, depending on dietary
  considerations.

  done, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Place the remaining stuffing in a
  small pan in the oven for the last 20 minutes to reheat.
    Serve immediately with each chop arranged on top of a portion
  of the remaining stuffing.

      Title: Rice, Apple and Raisin Dressing
 Categories: Cajun, Beef, Pork/ham, Dressings
      Yield: 8 servings
 
-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
      2 ts Salt                                1 ts Dry mustard
  1 1/2 ts White pepper                        1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
      1 ts Garlic powder                     1/2 ts Black pepper

------------------------------RICE INGREDIENTS------------------------------
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil                       4 tb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Chopped onions                  1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice (converted)
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers          3 c  Pork, beef or chicken stock
    1/2 c  Pecan halves, dry roasted           2 c  Chopped unpeeled apples
    1/2 c  Raisins                        
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
     In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until very hot,
  about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2
  minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the pecans (we ran out of pecans,
  so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and continue cooking for
  about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the raisins and butter
  (these are added together so the raisins will absorb as much butter
  as possible).  Stir until butter is melted, then cook until raisins
  are plump, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the rice and
  seasoning mix and cook until rice starts looking frizzly (a bit like
  ce Krispies)  Chef Prudhomme recommended using converted rice.  Lucy
  used brown, long grain rice - super!.  This will require about 2 to
  3 minutes, stirring almost constantly before the rice looks "frizzly".
  Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom well, then stir in the apples.
  Cover pan and bring to boil; lower heat and simmer covered for 5
  minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice is
  tender and stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes.  (We cook the rice
  this slow way to let the flavors build to their maximum.)
    Serve immediately, allowing about 3/4 cup per person.

  1 1/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper             1/2 ts Dried sweet basil leaves
      1 ts White pepper                  

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      1 lb Unsalted butter plus                2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      4 tb Unsalted butter                     1 tb Tabasco sauce + 1 teaspoon
      1 c  Onions, chopped very fine           2 cn Tomato sauce (16 oz)
      4 ea Med. garlic cloves, peeled          2 tb Sugar
      2 ts Minced garlic                       2 c  Green onions,chopped vy fine
  3 1/4 c  RICH chicken stock (see note  

---------------------------CHICKEN SEASONING MIX---------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Salt                                1 ts Black pepper
  1 1/2 ts White pepper                        1 ts Cumin (optional)
  1 1/2 ts Garlic powder                     1/2 ts Dried sweet basil leaves
  1 1/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper               2 lb Boneless chicken (see notes)
 
  NOTE:  To make a Rich Chicken Stock strain the basic stock, then continue
  simmering it until evaporation reduces the liquid by half.  For example,
  if the recipe calls for 1 cup Rich Stock, start it with at least 2 cups of
  strained basic stock.
  dark meat, cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
  Directions:
  Place in the hot water, oil and salt in a large pot over high heat; and
  cover and bring to a boil.  When water reaches a rolling boil, add small
  amounts of spaghetti at a time to the pot, breaking up oil patches as you
  drop the spaghetti in.  Return to boiling and cook to al dente stage, do
  not over cook.(To test doneness of spaghetti, cut a strand in half near
  the end of cooking time.  When done, there should be only a speck of white
  in the center, less than one-fourth the diameter of the strand.) Do not
  overcook.  During this cooking time, use a wooden or spaghetti spoon to
  lift spaghetti out of the water by spoonfuls and shake strands back into
  the boiling water.  (It may be an old wives' tale, but this procedure
  seems to enhance the spaghetti's texture.)  Then immediately drain
  spaghetti into a collander; stop cooking process by running cold water
  over strands.  (If you used dry spaghetti, first rinse with hot water to
  wash off starch.)  After the pasta has cooled thoroughly, about 2 to 3
  minutes, pour a liberal amount of vegetable oil in your hands and toss
  spaghetti.  Set aside still in the colander.
      Meanwhile, thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small
  bowl and set aside.
      In a 4-quart saucepan, combine 1-1/2 sticks of the butter, the onions
  and garlic cloves; saute over medium heat 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Add the minced garlic and seasoning mix; continue cooking
  over medium heat until onions are dark brown, but not burned, about 8 to
  10 minutes, stirring often.  Add 2-1/2 cups of the stock, the
  Worcestershire and Tabasco; bring to a fast simmer and cook about 8
  minutes, stirring often.  Stir in the tomato sauce and bring mixture to a
  boil.  Then stir in the sugar and 1 cup of the green onions; gently simmer
  uncovered about 40 nminutes, stirring occasionally.
      Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.
      Combine the ingredients of the chicken seasoning mix in a small bowl;
  mix well.  Sprinkle over the chicken, rubbing it in with your hands.  In a
  large skillet melt 1-1/2 sticks of the butter over medium heat.  Add the
  remaining 1 cup green onions and saute over high heat about 3 minutes.
  Add the chicken and continue cooking 10  minutes, stirring frequently.
  When the tomato sauce has simmered about 40 minutes, stir in the chicken
  mixture and heat through.
      To finish the dish, for each serving melt 2 tablespoons butter in a
  large skillet over medium heat.  Add one-sixth of the cooked spaghetti (a
  bit less than a 2 cup measure); heat spaghetti 1 minute, stirring
  constantly.  Add 1-1/4 cups chicken and sauce and 2 tablespoons of
  remaining stock; heat throughly, stirring frequently.  Remove from heat.
  Roll spaghetti on a large fork and lift onto a heated serving plate.
  Repeat process for remaining servings.

      Title: Louisiana Roast Beef
 Categories: Cajun, Beef
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 c  Onions, chopped very fine         3/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 c  Celery, chopped very fine         3/4 ts Minced garlic
    1/4 c  Bell peppers, chopped fine        1/2 ts Dry mustard
      2 tb Unsalted butter                   1/2 ts Ground cayenne

      1 ts White pepper                   
 
  In a small bowl combine the onions, celery, bell peppers, butter
  and seasonings, mix well.
  Place roast in a large roasing pan, fat side up.  With a large
  knife make 6 to 12 deep slits in the meat (to form pockets) down
  to a depth of about 1/2 inch from the bottom; do not cut all the
  way through.  Fill the pockets to their depths with the vegetable
  mixture, reserving about 1 tablespoon of the vegetables to rub
  over the top of the roast. Bake uncovered at 300F until a meat
  thermometer reads about 160F for medium doneness, about 3 hours.
  For rarer roast, cook until thermometer reads 140F. Serve immediately
  topped with some of the pan drippings if you like.

      Title: Cajun Prime Rib
 Categories: Cajun, Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 lb Prime rib roast (10-1/2 lbs)      1/4 c  Salt
    1/4 c  Black pepper                        2 ea Onions, thinly sliced
    1/4 c  Garlic powder                 

--------------------------SEASONING MIX (OPTIONAL--------------------------
      1 tb Plus 1 tsp, salt                    1 tb Plus 3/4 tsp, black pepper
      1 tb Plus 2 tsp, white pepper        2 1/2 ts Dry mustard
      1 tb Plus 2 tsp, fennel seeds        2 1/2 ts Ground cayenne pepper
 
  Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this for you) and
  save.  Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large
  roasting pan.  Then with a knife make several dozen punctures through
  the silver skin so seasoning can permeate meat.  Pour a very generous,
  even layer of black pepper over the top of the meat (the pepper should
  completely cover it); repeat with the garlic powder, then the salt,
  totally covering the preceding layer.  Carefully arrange the onions
  in an even layer on top so as not to knock off the seasoning.  Place
  the fat cap back on top.  Refrigerate 24 hours.
  Bake ribs in a 550F oven until the fat is dark brown and crispy on top,
  about 35 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool slightly.  Refrigerate
  until well chilled, about 3 hours.  (this is done so the juices will
  solidify and the steaks can be cooked rare.)  Remove fat cap and
  disgard.  With the blade of a large knife, scrape off the onions and
  as much of the seasonings as possible and discard.  Then with a long
  knife, slice between ribs into 6 steaks (4 will have bones); trim the
  cooked surface of meat from the 2 pieces that were on the outside of
  the roast.  Season and cook in your favorite way for steaks.
  TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS:  Combine the ingredients of the seasoning mix
  thoroughly in a small bowl; you will have about 8 tablespoons.
  Sprinkle the steaks generously and evenly on both sides with the mix.
  using about 4 teaspoons on each steak and pressing it in with your
  hands.
  Heat a cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the
  smoking stage and you see white ash on the skillet bottom--at least
  10 minutes.  (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.)  Place
  one steak in the hot skillet (cook only one side at a time) and cook
  over a very high heat until the underside starts to develop a heavy,
  black crust, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn the steak over and cook until
  the underside is crusted like the first, about 2 to 3 minutes more.
  Repeat with the remaining steaks.  Serve each steak while piping hot.
  (*NOTE*:  If you don't have a commercial hood vent over your stove,
  this dish may smoke you out of the kitchen.  It's worth it!  But you
  can also cook it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get
  hot enough to "blacken" the steak properly.  If you have a smoke
  detector in your house, you will be able to determine if it is working
  correctly.  This is NOT a dish to prepare in an apartment building
  with a central fire alarm system wired into your smoke detector.  It
  causes great excitement!  Also, you can be guaranteed you will meet
  your landlord.)

  1 1/2 ts salt                              1/2 ts turmeric
 
  Grind cumin seeds,  red chilies,  peppercorns, cardamom seeds, cinnamon,
  black  mustard  seeds and fenugreek seeds in a coffee-grinder  or  other
  spice grinder.   Put the ground spices in a bowl.  Add the vinegar, salt
  and sugar.  Mix and set aside.
  Heat  the  oil in a wide,  heavy pot over a medium flame.   Put  in  the
  onions.   Fry,  stirring  frequently,  until  the onions turn brown  and
  crisp.   Remove  the onions with a slotted spoon and put them  into  the
  container  of  an  electric blender or food processor.   (Turn  off  the
  heat.)   Add  2-3  tablespoons of water to the  blender  and  puree  the
  onions.   Add this puree to the ground spices in the bowl.  (This is the
  vindaloo paste.  It may be made ahead of time and frozen.)
  Dry  off  the meat cubes with a paper towel and remove large  pieces  of
  fat, if any.
  Put  the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender  or
  food processor.  Add 2-3 tablespoons of water and blend until you have a
  smooth paste.
  Heat  the oil remaining in the pot once again over a medium-high  flame.
  When hot, put in the pork cubes, a few at a time, and brown them lightly
  on  all  sides.   Remove each batch with a slotted spoon and keep  in  a
  bowl.   Do all the pork this way.   Now put the ginger-garlic paste into
  the same pot.   Turn down the heat to medium.   Stir the paste for a few
  seconds.  Add the coriander and turmeric.  Stir for another few seconds.
  Add  the  meat,  any  juices that may have accumulated as  well  as  the
  vindaloo paste and the water.  Bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer gently
  for  an  hour  or until port is tender.   Stir a few times  during  this
  cooking period.  Serve with rice.

      Title: True Garlic Bread
 Categories: Breads, Garlic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 x  Garlic Puree(2 Roasted Head)        2 tb Kosher Salt
    1/4 lb Unsalted Butter, Softened       3 1/4 c  Whole Wheat Flour
      2 tb (2 pk) Dry yeast                3 1/4 c  Unbleached All Purpose Flour
    1/2 c  Warm Water (115-120 degrees)        1 x  Cornmeal
  2 1/2 c  Warm Water                     
 
  Cream together the garlic puree and butter.  (This may be done days in
  advance and refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature before using).
  Combine the yeast with 1/2 cup warm water in large bowl.  Stir with a fork
  or small whisk.  Add an additional 2 1/2 cups water.  Add salt.  Stir in
  the flour, 1 c at a time, beginning with the whole wheat.  Use a whisk
  until the dough becomes stiff, then switch to a wooden spoon.  Turn the
  dough onto a well floured work surface.  Knead rhythmically for 10 to 15
  minutes, until the dough is smooth, springy, nonsticky, and elastic.  Add
  more flour as you knead if necessary.  The dough is ready if you can poke
  to fingers into it and the resulting indentations spring back.  Cover the
  dough with a cloth and let rest while you wash, dry and generously butter
  the bowl.  Knead the dough a few more turns, then form it into a ball and
  place it in the bowl.  Turn it to coat with butter.  Cover the bowl and
  put it in a warm, draft-free place until the dough has doubled in bulk,
  about 1 1/2 hours.  It has risen sufficiently when you can gently poke a
  finger into the dough and the hole reamins.  (Don't poke too
  enthusiastically or the dough will collapse.)  When doubled, flour your
  fist and punch the dough down.  Knead it a few times and then let it rest.
  Sprinkle 1 large or 2 small baking sheets with a liberal amount of
  cornmeal.  Divide the dough into 3 equal parts.  While you work with 1
  piece, keep the other 2 covered.  Flour your work surface.  With a rolling
  pin, roll each piece of dough into a rectangle approximately 14-inches long
  X 7-inches wide.  Spread it with softened garlic butter.  Roll the long
  edge toward the opposite long edge, as if you were rolling up a rug.
  Pinch ends closed.  Place loves on the baking sheets.  With a sharp knife
  or razor blade, slash the loves lightly at 2-inch intervals.  Cover with a
  cloth and place in a warm draft-free place to rise until doubled, about
  1/2 hour.  Meanwhile preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Bake for 35 to 40
  minutes with a pan of boiling water on the oven floor.  Spray loaves with
  water several times during the baking process.  (This helps the bread form
  a thick crusty shell.)  To test for doneness, rap the loaf with your
  knuckles.  The loaf should sound hollow.  Cool on wire racks, but the
  loaves are delicious eaten warm right out of the oven.

  the flour, sugar and salt.  Beat with an electric mixer on the lowest
  speed for 1 minute.  Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes longer.  Add the
  butter to the yeast mixture and beat for another 1 minute.  On the lowest
  speed on the mixer, beat in 1 egg and 1/2 cup of flour until well blended,
  repeating until the 4 eggs are used up and enough flour has been added to
  make a soft sticky dough.  Continue to beat with the mixer or by hand,

  from the refrigerator.  Divide in half and cover and refrigerate the
  second ball of dough.  Knead the remaining ball of dough on a lightly
  floured surface until soft and pliable.  Divide the dough into 3 equal
  parts and roll each piece into a rope 12 to 16-inches long.  Braid the
  ropes, starting in the middle and working toward each end.  Pinch the ends
  together so seal them.  Grease a large baking sheet and place the finished
  braid on one side of the sheet.  Repeat with the refrigerated dough.  In a
  small bowl beat the egg and milk together.  Brush the braids with the egg
  mixture and let the braids rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until
  dough in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Do not cover.  Midway through the
  rising time, brush with the egg mixture again.  Preheat the oven to 400
  degrees F.  When fully risen, brush with the egg mixture for a final time
  and sprinkle evenly with the celery seeds.  Bake for 40 minutes in the
  preheated oven until a wooden skewer or pick inserted in the braid comes
  out dry.  Remove from the oven and from the baking sheet.  Cool to room
  temperature, on wire racks, before slicing.

  CHEDDAR CRUST:
  Combine the flour, cheese and salt in a bowl.  Using a pastry blender or
  two knives, cut in the shortening until coarse crumbs form.  Sprinkle the
  iced water (5 or 6 tbls will be needed) and using a fork, toss the crumbs
  until a dough is formed.  Press the dough firmly into a ball.
  FILLING:
  Divide the pastry almost in half and roll out the larger half, on a
  lightly floured surface, to a 13-inch circle.  Line a 9-inch pie plate
  with the pastry, trimming the edges to 1/2-inch beyond the rim of the pie
  plate.  (Note:  When lining the pie plate, be careful not to stretch the
  pastry when spreading it out.  This will cause holes or the pastry will
  shrink and the filling will run over in the oven as it is baked.  Place in
  the pie plate and gently, working from the center, spread the pastry out
  until it covers the bottom of the pie plate and then lay the rest of the
  pastry over the rim and trim.)  Combine the apples, sugar, flour, and
  cinnamon in a bowl, mixing well.  Arrange the apple mixture in the pastry
  lined pie plate.  Roll out the remaining pastry to an 11-inch circle.
  Gently fold into quarters and cut steam slits in the folds.  Unfold the
  crust and place on top of the filling, trimming the crust to 1-inch beyond
  the rim of the pie plate.  Fold the top crust under the lower one and
  flute to form a ridge around the edge of the pie plate.  Combine the egg
  yolk and water, then brush the mixture over the top crust and rim.  Bake
  in a 400 degree F. oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until apples are tender
  and the crust is a golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack until slightly warm
  and serve with Vanilla Ice Cream, if desired.

    1/2 c  Peanuts; raw                        1 ea large egg white
      3 c  Peanut Oil                      1 1/2 tb water chestnut flour
      2 ea whole chicken breasts at roo  

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      4 ea green onions                      1/2 tb dark soy sauce
      2 ea large cloves garlic             1 1/2 ts chili paste with garlic
      1 tb minced ginger root                  1 tb dry sherry
    1/2 c  chicken stock                       1 ea pinch sugar
    1/2 tb sesame oil                          1 ea cornstarch paste
    1/2 tb Chinese red vingear            
 
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and white part
  into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in 2-quart saucepan.
  Reserve.
  Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones.  Slice meat into
  1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks.  In bowl large enough to hold
  chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour.  Beat mixture with a single
  chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk).  Stir chicken pieces into egg
  mixture to coat thoroughly.  Marinate 5 minutes.  Note: water chestnut
  flour gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be
  substituted.
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (you'll
  need more oil for deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a light tan
  color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.  Remove peanuts
  with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag.
  Reserve.
  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first:  chicken should
  raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes.  Deep-fry coated
  chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a
  time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces separate while they are
  frying.  Remove with long chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve.
  Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green onions
  & peanuts about a minute before serving.  At the last minute, add chicken
  pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

  chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, and sweet chocolate.  The semisweet
  chocolate is made from chocolate that is just slight sweetened with sugar.
  Unsweetened chocolate is the original baking or cooking chocolate and has

  cooking chocolate used in the Chocolate Pots de Creme recipe, is
  chocolate mixed with sugar and sometimes additional cocoa butter or
  flavorings.

  lard or shortening with your fingers or a fork.  Add baking soda dissolved
  in a little warm water to the sponge and then add the flour mixture.

  out to about 1/2 inch thickness or a little thicker,and cut with a biscuit
  cutter.  Place close together in a 9 x 13-inch pan, turning to grease tops.

    1/3 c  Olive oil                           2 ea Zucchini, finely chopped

  There are as many versions of vegetable soup in Italy as there
  there are cooks.
  Pancetta - Pancetta is the same cut of pork as bacon.  It is cured
  with salt and is not smoked.  It comes rolled up like a large
  salami.  Widely used in Italian cooking, especially in Emilia-Romagna,
  it is vital to many dishes.  If available, buy a large quantity.
  Cut into several pieces and freeze it.  You can substitute domestic
  bacon for pancetta.  It must be blanched in boiling water for two 
  three minutes to reduce the smoky flavour.  Fresh side pork can also
  be used.  I'll be posting several recipes over the next while that
  call for pancetta, so if you can find some, it won't go to waste.
  Prepare chicken broth (see my previously posted recipe).  Heat oil
  in a large saucepan.  Add parsley and garlic.  Saute over medium
  heat.  Before garlic changes colour, add pancetta.  Saute until
  lightly browned.  Stir in cabbage.  Cover and cook 1 to 2 minutes.
  Add remaining vegetables to saucepan.  Cover and cook about 5
  minutes.  Add broth and water, if using, and prosciutto rind or ham
  shank.  Cover and reduce heat.  Simmer 40 to 50 minutes.  Remove
  half the vegetables with a slotted spoon.  Place in a blender or
  food processor and process until smooth.  Return to saucepan.
  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve hot with Parmesan cheese
  sprinkled over top.  Makes 8 to 10 servings.
  VARIATION:
  Toast about 20 thick slices of Italian bread.  Place 2 slices
  in each soup bowl and sprinkle generously with Parmesan cheese.
  Ladle soup into bowls.  Serve with additional Parmesan cheese.

      Title: Frances Cook's Bread & Rolls
 Categories: Breads, Londontowne
      Yield: 24 servings
 
    3/4 c  Milk                                1 ts Salt
      1 ea Fresh cake yeast                    1 ea Egg
    1/4 c  Sugar                           3 1/2 c  Flour
      3 tb Shortening                        1/4 c  Lukewarm water
 
  Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, & salt. Let it cool to
  lukewarm while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water. When
  soft, add the egg and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg mixture
  into the milk mixture and stir them together.
  The flour may be sifted or poured into the liquid. With a large spoon,
  stir until flour/milk is well mixed. You should have a firm, but not stiff
  dough. Without removing it from the bowl, cover the dough with a plate or
  towel and set aside to rise until double in bulk (about 2 hrs depending on
  the temperature in the kitchen). Instead of letting the dough rise at this
  point you may put it in the refrigerator and use it later, or the next
  day. Watch to make sure it doesn't spill out of the bowl. If it starts to
  spill before you're ready to use it, punch it back down. Refrigerated
  dough is easier to handle but takes longer to rise.
  BREAD:
  If you want to make bread, dump the dough out of the bowl onto a floured
  surface and with more flour as needed to keep it from sticking, knead it
  until springy and easy to handle. This dough does not require a lot of
  kneading; only enough to make it easy to handle. For 2 medium size loaves
  cut the dough in half and knead/shape each into loaves and put into
  greased baking pans. Allow about 2 hours for the dough to double again.
  Bake in a 375 degree oven until lightly browned on top (if uncertain
  whether or not bread is done, tip out of pan and see if bottom is browned
  too).
  ROLLS:
  To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily handled. Roll
  out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter and fold over and
  place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse rolls), or break dough into
  small pieces, make into little balls and place 3 in each section of a
  greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls).
  SWEET ROLLS:
  For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as for Parkerhouse
  rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a round. Spread it with
  raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Dot with butter and roll as
  for a jelly roll. Slice and place on a greased pan or make into a circle
  and make slashes through the dough at intervals. Let rise and bake as for
  loaves. Top with an icing made of confectioners' sugar, melted butter,
  milk, and vanilla or rum flavoring and drizzle over the bread or rolls
  while hot. Decorate with nuts or fruits.
  If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use half white and half whole
  wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of white. The amounts above will
  yield 1 large or 2 medium loaves of bread, or 2 dozen large rolls.

      8 c  Whole wheat flour                   3 tb Soya flour
      4 tb Honey-molasses                      3 c  Corn oil
      3 tb Wheat germ                          3 pk Yeast
  3 1/2 c  Very warm water                     2 tb Salt
 
  This recipe is for 2 loaves of bread. If one loaf is desired, use 2
  packages yeast instead of 3 and cut all other ingredients in half. Wheat
  germ and soya flour may be omitted.
  Put flour in oven to warm, at lowest heat. In a VERY large bowl, dissolve
  yeast in 3/4 cup of very warm water. Add honey to yeast. Coat loaf pans
  well with margarine and flour. Add oil, 2-1/2 cups warm water, and 2T salt
  yeast. Add about 4c flour mixture and beat at medium speed for 2 minutes.
  Gradually add more flour, beating well. Dough should be sticky - if runny,
  add more flour. Put in pans, smoothing top and making sure dough is pushed
  into corners. Cover with hot, wet towel and let rise in warm place. Check
  bread in about 20 minutes and keep checking to be sure dough doesn't rise
  over lip of pan. When dough has risen ALMOST to lip of pan, bake at 450
  degrees for about 40 mins. Remove from pan immediately and cool on rack.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 ea White onions                      1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 pt Whipping cream                      4 tb Butter
      4 tb Flour                             1/2 ts Salt
 
     Peel the onions.  Parboil in about 3/4 cup water.  (I do this part 
     in a covered casserole in the microwave).  Make white sauce with 
     rest of ingredients.  If you like a stronger onion flavor, thin the
     white sauce with part or all of the onion water.  Otherwise, thin it
     with your choice of cream, milk, water, chicken broth or whatever
     flavor you like.  Add onions and bake at 325 to 350 until bubbly. If
     you're a real creamed onion pig like we are, this will not serve
     four.

 Categories: Cakes, Sauces
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      2 ea 9-inch layers of choc. Cake       1/3 c  Light Corn Syrup
      1 ea Fudge Icing (Recipe)                1 c  Brown Sugar, firmly packed
      1 ea Caramel Sauce (Recipe)              2 ts Butter
  1 1/2 c  Cashews, roasted, unsalted        1/8 ts Salt
      2 c  Heavy Cream                       1/3 c  Heavy Cream
  2 1/2 lb Semisweet Chocolate            
 
  FOR CAKE:
     Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to make 4 round cake
  layers.  Place 1 layer on plate and top with Fudge Icing, Caramel Sauce
  and Cashews.  Repeat with next 2 cake layers.  Place final cake layer on
  top, frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing and cover sides of cake
  with chopped cashews.
  FUDGE ICING:
  Bring cream to boil.  Stir in chocolate until melted and smooth.
  This will be very soft but will harden when cooled.  Refrigerate until
  workable consistency.        NOTE: The time it takes to get to a workable
  consistency depends on the weather.  This is much like making fudge candy.
  The author, (Arlene Lightsey), made this sauce on a cool, clear day and
  had no problem.
  CARAMEL SAUCE:
  Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and reduce to thick syrup. Very
  carefully, (because it will splatter), add cream.  Refrigerate until cool.

      Title: Piney Woods Hush Puppies
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 48 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Yellow Corn Meal                    1 tb Baking Powder
      1 ts Soda                                1 ea Egg, beaten
      1 ts Salt                                2 c  Buttermilk
      2 tb Granulated Sugar                1 1/2 c  Cooking Oil (about)
      2 tb All-Purpose Flour              
 
  Mix all dry ingredients; beat milk and egg together and combine with dry
  ingredients; batter should hold its shape when picked up in spoon. If it
  is too soft, add more cornmeal. Drop by molded Tablespoon into 350"F fat
  and cook about 1 1/2 minutes; turn and cook on second side 1 minute. Allow
  oil to heat a few seconds after removing a batch. Delicious freshly cooked
  and hot; however, leftover hush puppies freeze well. When ready to serve
  frozen hush puppies, place on oven rack in preheated 250"F until very hot
  and crisp. Makes about 48 hush puppies 2" round.
  Hints on frying: Using a small diameter heavy saucepan allows using a
  minimum oil; a 5 or 6 inch pan with oil 1 1/2 inches deep and heated to
  350"F will cook three hush puppies in about 2 1/2 minutes. When batter
  consistency is correct and oil is at 350"F, hush puppies will become firm,
  round shapes almost as soon as they enter the hot oil. If they are cooked
  in oil that is too hot, they will not cook in the center.
  Serving suggestions: Especially good served with fried catfish, trout,
  shrimp, oysters, chicken or chicken-fried steak.

      Title: Sam Arnold's Boneless Rump Roast
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 x  Boneless Rump Roast                 1 x  Wine; OR
      1 x  Salt                                1 x  Vinegar; OR
      1 x  Fresh Rosemary Needles              1 x  Lemon Juice
      1 x  Garlic Salt                         1 x  Beef Stock; OR
      1 x  Freshly Ground Black Pepper         1 x  Red Wine
      1 x  Beer; OR                            1 x  Minced Shallots
 
  NOTE:  This recipe is adjustable to all sizes of roasts.  This is the
  Marinate the meat for a couple of hours in a liquid that is slightly
  acidic--a liquid such as wine, beer, vinegar, or lemon juice.  Roast for
  15 minutes per pound at 325 degrees F.  For the last 15 minutes, cook at
  500 degrees F.  For example, for a 4 pound roast, total cooking time is 1
  hour but it will be 45 minutes at 325 degrees F. and 15 minutes at 500
  degrees F.  This will crust the outside of the roast and the inside will
  be medium, barely pink.  This is based on room temperature meat.  If the
  meat is quite cold, extend the baking time.  After 3/4 of the cooking
  time, sprinkle with salt and some fresh or dry rosemary needles.  Turn the
  roast with WOODEN SPOONS (Very important that you do not pierce the meat)
  and season it all over.  Rosemary, seasoned salt or garlic salt are nice,
  and some freshly ground black pepper adds to the flavor also.  Swab the
  roast with some fresh lemon juice--this will also add to the zing of the
  meat.  When cooked, snip off the cords and slice to serve.  From the
  roasting pan, spoon off the fat from the accumulated juice.  Add some beef
  stock or red wine to the juices, a few minced shallots or green onion
  shreds and cook down at high heat to a reduction or concentrated sauce.
  Adjust the seasonings, salt, pepper, and herbs of your choice, and serve
  with the roast.

      Title: Filled Berlin Doughnuts (Bismarks)
 Categories: Breads, Desserts
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 pk Active Dry Yeast; OR                2 ts Rum Extract
      1 tb Active Dry Yeast; Bulk              1 c  Milk; Scalded
    1/4 c  Warm Water; (110-115 Deg F)         1 x  Unbleached Flour; *
    1/2 c  Sugar                               2 ea Eggs; Lg, Well Beaten
      1 ts Salt                                1 x  Fat For Deep Frying; **
    1/3 c  Butter Or Regular Margarine         1 x  Jam Or Jelly
      1 tb Orange Juice                   
 
  *    Use up to 4 cups of Unbleached Flour in this recipe.
  **   Heat the fat to 375 degrees F. for frying the doughnuts.
  Soften the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until it
  "blooms" or proofs.  Put a half cup of sugar, the salt, butter, orange
  juice and rum extract in a large bowl.  Pour the scalded milk over the
  ingredients in the bowl.  Stir until the butter is melted.  Cool to
  lukewarm.  When cool, blend in 1 cup of the unbleached flour and beat
  until smooth.  Stir in the yeast and add about half of the remaining
  flour, beating until smooth.  Beat in the eggs.  Then beat in enough of
  the remaining flour to make a SOFT (should be slightly sticky and light in
  weight).  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and let rest for
  5 to 10 minutes.  Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to 10 minutes).
  Form into a ball and put into a greased bowl, turning to grease the top of
  the ball of dough.  Cover and let rise in a warm draft free place until
  doubled in bulk.  Punch the dough down, kneading lightly to remove all of
  the air pockets, and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
  Roll to 1/2-inch thickness.  Cut the dough into rounds using a 3-inch
  biscuit or cookie cutter.  Cover with waxed paper and let rise on the
  rolling surface away from drafts and direct heat, until double in bulk,
  (30 to 45 minutes).  About 20 minutes before frying, heat the fat.  Fry
  the doughnuts in the heated fat.  Put only as many doughnuts at one time
  as will float uncrowded in a single layer deep in the fat.  Fry 2 to 3
  minutes or until lightly browned; turn the doughnuts with a fork or tongs,
  being careful not to pierce the doughnut, when they rise to the surface.
  Do this several times during the cooking.  Lift from the fat, draining for
  a few seconds over the fat before removing to absorbent paper toweling.
  Cool.  Cut a slit through the center in the side of each doughnut.  Force
  about 1/2 ts of jam or jelly into the center and press lightly to close
  the slit.  (A pastry bag and tube may be used to force the jelly or jam
  into the slit.)  Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at one time in a bag containing
  granulated or powdered sugar.  (Your choice.)  Shake lightly to remove the
  excess sugar.

  From The Gazette, 91/01/09. The Pizzalini restaurant is owned by Spiro
  Maltezos. With his Hobart mixer running very slowly, Maltezos allows one
  hour to make the dressing. "A tiny hole punched in a can lets the
  vegetable oil drip into the eggs at a suitable rate," he said. The
  restaurant is located at 4805 Sources in Pierrefond (Montreal).

      Title: Basic Divinity
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  White Sugar; Granulated             1 ts Vanilla Extract
    1/2 c  Light Corn Syrup                    1 c  Nuts; Chopped, OR
    1/2 c  Water                               1 c  Cherries; Chopped, OR
      1 pn Salt (1/8 tsp)                      1 c  Orange Peels; Chopped, Etc.
      2 ea Egg Whites; Lg                 
 
  ~------------------------------OPTIONALS ---------------------------------
  NOTE:  TO PREWARM A CANDY THERMOMETER, SIMPLE PLACE IT AN A SMALL SAUCE
  PAN OF COLD WATER AND BRING IT TO A BOIL.  LET IT SIMMER UNTIL YOU NEED
  THE THERMOMETER.
  STEP 1:  Prewarm the thermometer; separate the eggs allowing the whites to
  come to room temperature in a large bowl of an electric mixer.  (Return
  the egg yolks to the refrigerator covering with plastic wrap or water for
  another recipe.)  Fill a glass with ice cubes and water.  To make dropped
  divinities, you will need 2 cookie sheets, topped with greased wax paper.
  For squares, use a greased and wax paper-lined 8 X 8-inch pan.  Measure
  the sugar, corn syrup, ice water and salt and dump into a heavy 2-quart
  saucepan with a tight fitting lid.
  STEP 2:  Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon over
  low heat.  Syrup will become clear, gritty sounds will cease, and the
  spoon will glide smoothly over the bottom of the pan.  Increase the heat
  to medium and bring to a boil.
  STEP 3:  (OPTIONAL):  Cover pan with a square of wax paper and lid,
  pushing down firmly.  Steam for 2 to 3 minutes to dissolve the sugar
  crystals.  (Listen to make sure the pot doesn't boil over.  To
  double-check, remove lid, leaving the wax paper in place.)
  STEP 4:  Wash down any crystals clinging to the sides with a brush dipped
  in hot water from the thermometer bath.  Introduce the prewarmed
  thermometer.  No need to stir.
  STEP 5:  Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.  If your mixer is a
  heavy duty one, you can wait until the bubbles in the syrup become very
  large and airy before beating the egg whites.  Otherwise, do it now when
  the thermometer registers 240 Degrees F. (115.5 C.).
  STEP 6:  Test the syrup when the thermometer registers 246 degrees F. (119
  C.).  Continue testing until it reach the firm-ball stage, 246 to 260
  degrees F. (119 to 126.5 C.).  Syrup will be hard to scrape up in ice
  water.  It will have to be forced into a ball, but once formed, it should
  hold its shape but give under pressure.  Return the thermometer to the hot
  water bath to soak clean.
  STEP 7:  Dribble the syrup into the egg whites in a slow, steady stream,
  beating at slow speed.  Tilt the syrup pan to get the last drop but do not
  scrape the pan.  Once the syrup is completely incorporated, change to a
  flat whip if you have one.
  STEP 8:  Have patience and continue beating.  The amount of time you spend
  mixing depends on the power of your mixer.  If you have a heavy duty or
  commercial one, you can go to full speed and make the divinity in less
  than 5 minutes.  With less powerful ones, it can take up to 20 minutes.
  The important thing is to beat at the highest speed of your mixer.  Also
  if it is a hot and humid day, it will take longer also.
  STEP 9:  Test the divinity.  The first and most important test occurs when
  you lift the beaters.  If the candy falls back in ribbons that immediately
  merge back into the batter, it isn't done.  Eventually, a stationary
  column will form between the beaters and the bowl.  Candy will lose its
  sheen/gloss and stop being sticky; a teaspoonful dropped onto wax paper
  will hold its shape, even a peak.  If you machine is laboring and the
  candy is not quite there yet, you have two choices: Pour anyway and put
  into a frost free freezer to set up....or finish by hand.
  STEP 10:  Fold in the flavorings and nuts and/or other optional items
  using the mixer or if very thick, a wooden spoon.
  STEP 11:  Drop or spread the divinity either on wax paper-covered cookie
  sheets or the buttered pan.  Dripping it by teaspoon is harder work for
  you but it ripens quicker and is ready to eat sooner.  A neat trick is to
  put the candy into a pastry bag and pipe onto the wax paper.  If you
  spread it in the pan, you will have to wait up to 24 hours before it is
  ready.  But you maybe one of those that think it is better when it is 24
  hours old.  Score and cut into squares.  Store in an airtight container at
  room temperature or in a refrigerator.
  Makes 1 pound but looks like more.  Recipe CANNOT be doubled; it can be
  frozen but not for extended periods of time.

  Cover the apricots with the apple juice and bring to a full boil.  Reduce
  the heat and simmer, covered, 30 minutes.  Stir the apricots occasionally
  so they will not stick or burn.  Let the apricots cool, then strain.
  Reserve the cooking liquid.  Chop the cooked apricots and set aside.  In a
  2-quart saucepan combine the orange juice, honey, water, cornstarch,
  ginger and cinnamon.  Heat, stirring constantly, until thickened slightly.
  Remove the pan from the heat and add the apricots, their cooking liquid
  and vermouth.  Serve hot or well chilled.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 ea Flower pot                          8 oz Cream cheese, softened
      1 ea Garden trowel                       1 c  Confectioner's sugar
      3 ea Gummy worms (or plastic)            1 ts Vanilla
      1 ea Plastic flowers, bunch              2 pk Inst choc-fudge pudding(4oz)
     16 oz Oreo cookies                        3 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Butter, softened                   12 oz Whipped topping,1 tub thawed
 
  This is a joke, a bit of whimsy to lighten up your next party. The cake is
  really a quick mix dessert made with Oreo cookies and soft squishy stuff.
  The trick is to capture everyone's attention with an announcement of some
  sort, and as you are speaking, trowel out some of the dirt from the flower
  pot around the flowers and eat it. May be followed by a worm dug out of
  the "dirt". You may substitute vanilla pudding for the chocolate if you
  want, and use up to 20 oz of Oreos. Please use a clean new plastic flower
  pot or take the precaution of lining a clay pot with foil and wrap the
  stems of live flowers if you use them in order to prevent any toxins from
  entering the dessert.
    Crush the cookies until they resemble potting soil.  Set aside.  
    Cream the butter or margarine, cream cheese, sugar  and vanilla until
  smooth and fluffy.  Set aside.  Combine the pudding mix and milk until
  well blended.  Then fold in the whipped topping.  Gently fold the cream
  cheese and pudding mixtures together.
    To put the "cake" together, layer one-third of the cookie crumbs
  followed by 1/2 of the pudding mixture, 1/3 of the crumbs, the rest of the
  pudding mixture and topping with the balance of the crumbs.   Refrigerate
  10-12 hours before serving.  Remove from refrigerator, decorate with
  flowers.  Serve by digging out portions with the trowel.  Serves 10 to 12.

      5 ea Large Carrots                     1/4 ts Pepper
 
  Food writer Norene Gilletz has adapted her grandmother's chicken soup
  recipe for cooking by microwave.
  In a soup kettle, combine chicken and salted water. Bring to a boil. Skim
  surface. Add carrots, celery, onion, dill and pepper to the hot broth.
  Cover and simmer until meat is tender and vegetables are cooked -- about
  two hours. Strain and refrigerate. Remove the fat that congeals on top and
  discard. Serve soup with noodles or rice, cooked separately or in the
  strained broth.
  Microwave method: Gilletz prefers this method, because all the ingredients
  and can be added at once and there is no need to skim the broth.
  In a bowl, pour boiling water over chicken. Trim off excess fat. Place
  chicken in a five-quart microwave-safe casserole. Cut carrots and celery
  into chunks. Add to chicken along with onion, dill and seasonings. cover
  with water. To prevent boiling over, take care water remains 1 1/2 inches
  below top of the casserole. Cover casserole and microwave at high (100 %)
  power for 30 - 35 minutes or until soup is boiling. Stir. Simmer at medium
  power for 25 - 30 minutes. Let stand covered for 15 - 20 minutes. Strain
  soup. Serve as above.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Land snails                       1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 x  Water                               1 x  Freshly ground black pepper
      1 x  Salt                              1/2 c  Lemon juice
      2 ea Cloves garlic finely chopped   
 
    Serves 6 to 8.
    1.  There is a small membrane, known as an operculum, at the opening
  of each snail.  Use a toothpick to remove this membrane and it will
  come off easily.
    2.  Place the snails in a basin and rinse thoroughly with cold
  water.  Drain and rinse once more in cold water that contains a
  generous amount of salt.  Rinse once more in cold water before
  cooking.
    3.  Add four quarts of cold water to a kettle and add the snails and
  about three tablespoons salt.  Bring slowly to a boil and simmer six
  minutes, stirring occasionally.
    4.  Meanwhile, place the garlic and one teaspoon of salt in a small,
  heavy bowl.  Crush the garlic with a pestle or the back of a heavy
  spoon to make a paste.  Add the oil, pepper (to taste), lemon juice,
  and six tablespoons cold water.  Stir with a whisk to blend.
    5.  Drain the snails and serve hot with the sauce cold.
    Note:  To eat the snails, pull out the meat with a pick and dip them
  one at a time in the sauce.  The whole snail may be eaten, although
  the most fastidious prefer to skip the soft after end of the meat,
  which is the digestive tract.

     24 ea Frogs' legs                    
 
  [Looking at the ingredients, I figure that this'll feed 4 as a main
  course or 8 as an appetizer.  -- mkm]
  Preparation 1 1/2 hours.  Cooking 1 1/4 hours.
  Cook the snails in advance in a court bouillon, then remove them from
  their shells.  [There's a description of court bouillon in "Joy of
  Cooking."  Basically, a court bouillon is an aromatic liquid or stock,
  sometimes containing wine, vinegar or lemon juice, used mainly for
  cooking fish and shellfish, but also sometimes white offal (variety
  meats) and some white meats.  -- mkm]  Chop them, together with the
  peeled shallots and a small bunch of well-washed chives.  Place these
  ingredients in a saucepan with the wine, cover and simmer for 1 hour.
  Meanwhile, soak the frogs' legs in the milk for 1 hour.  Drain them,
  then roll in flour and saute in the butter in a frying pan over a
  brisk heat for 10 minutes.  Add the snails, together with their
  cooking juices, and season with salt and pepper.  [Personally, I
  prefer to mill the pepper at the dinner table.  The smell of the
  freshly ground pepper would otherwise be lost.  -- mkm]  Turn up the
  heat and cook for a further 5 minutes.
  Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.

      1 x  Vinegar                             6 ea Shelled walnuts, ground
      2 ea Thyme sprigs                        4 ea Canned anchovy fillets
    1/2 ea Bay leaf                            3 ea Garlic cloves
      1 ea Basil sprig                         1 x  Salt and pepper
      1 ea Pared orange peel                   3 tb Flour
      7 oz Pork rind                       6 1/2 lb Whole trimmed spinach leaves
    1/2 c  Olive oil                      
 
  Preparation time 3 hours.  Cooking time 2 1/2 hours.
  Starve the snails for at least 8 days, then wash them in several
  changes of water until clean.  Rinse with vinegar, then drain.
  Place the snails in a saucepan of boiling water with the thyme, bay
  leaf, basil, orange peel and pork rind.  When the snails are almost
  cooked, drain them and remove them from their shells.  [I guess
  boiling them makes it easier to remove them from their shells.  --mkm]
  Brown the snails in olive oil with the fatty bacon, very finely
  chopped [I assume the author means chop the bacon first.  --mkm], the
  ground walnuts, anchovy fillets, crushed garlic and salt and pepper.
  Thicken the mixture with the flour, then serve on a bed of spinach.
  [Make sure you wash all the grit off the spinach first.  --mkm]

  bring the temperature down.  Drop in the butter and let cool slightly,
  without stirring.  beat until it starts to thicken, add the vanilla and
  the pecans and continue to beat until the candy loses some of its gloss.
  Spread evenly in the pan and mark into squares.  When firm, cut into
  pieces and store in an airtight container.

      Title: Brown Sugar Fudge (Penuche)
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  White Sugar; Granulated             2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate; 2 Sqs
      1 c  Light Brown Sugar; Firm Pack        4 tb Butter; 1/2 stick
    1/2 c  Heavy (Whipping) Cream          1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      3 tb Molasses; *                       1/2 c  Chopped Nuts; Optional
 
  *    This is to taste.  The original recipe called for 4 Tbls of Molasses,
  STEP 1:  PREPARE:
  Prewarm the thermometer in hot water; use a 2-quart saucepan; butter the
  upper sides (inside) of the saucepan; measure all ingredients except the
  vanilla and optionals, and dump into the saucepan.  Grease and if
  necessary, line a 5 X 10-inch pan.  Fill glass with ice cubes and water
  and the sink with 1/2 inch of cold water.
  STEP 2:
  Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over low heat
  until the butter melts, the gritty sounds cease, and the spoon glides
  smoothly over the bottom of the pan.  Increase the heat to medium and
  bring to a boil.
  STEP 3:
  Boil, after washing down any crystals that may have formed, with a pastry
  brush dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath, using as little water
  as possible.  Introduce the prewarmed thermometer.  Reduce the heat while
  keeping the fudge at a boil.  Stir no more than necessary.
  STEP 4:
  Test the fudge mixture in the ice-cold water when the mixture thickens and
  bubbles become noisy.  Ball, formed in ice water, should hold its shape
  until the heat from your had begins to flatten it and should be al dente
  ~- slightly chewy -- between 230 and 240 (110 and 115.5 degrees C.).
  Because of the molasses and brown sugar, it can ball at a lower
  temperature than some other fudges.
  STEP 5:
  Shock by placing the saucepan in the cold water in the sink.
  STEP 6:
  Seed by adding, without stirring, the vanilla.  Then allow to cool.
  STEP 7:
  Stir when luke warm and "skin" forms on the top (110 degrees F.(43.5
  degrees C.)).  Return the thermometer to its hot water bath to soak clean.
  Stir the fudge thoroughly but not vigorously by hand, with an electric
  mixer, or with a food processor.  Pause frequently to allow the fudge to
  react.
  STEP 8:
  Watch for the fudge to thicken, lose its sheen, and become lighter in
  color or streaked with lighter shade, give off some heat, suddenly
  stiffen.  If mixing by had, the fudge will "snap" with each stroke; by
  mixer, mixer waves will become very distinct, by food processor, fudge will
  flow sluggishly back to the center when the processor is stopped.
  STEP 9:
  Add the optionals (1/2 Cup Chopped Nuts (walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts
  (filberts)) before the fudge totally candies.
  STEP 10:
  Pour, score, and store when cool in an airtight container in the
  refrigerator or at room temperature.
  YIELD:  1 pound of fudge.  Recipe is easily doubled and can be frozen.
  VARIATIONS:
  HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eleminate the unsweetened chocolate
  and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of honey.  The honey causes the
  fudge to ball at a higher temperature.
  CHOCOLATE HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, replace the heavy cream
  with light cream or evaporated milk and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup
  of honey.
  ORANGE BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eleminate molasses, chocolate but
  add 1 Tbl corn syrup.  In Step 6, add 1 Tbl grated orange zest, plus if
  you can get it, 1 tsp of pure orange extract.
  PEANUT BUTTER BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eliminate the molasses and
  chocolate, replace the heavy cream with 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of
  creamy peanut butter.  To intensify the peanut butter flavor, add 1/3 of a
  cup of salted peanuts in Step 9.
  PRALINE BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eliminating the molasses is
  optional -- you'ss get a more Southern praline with it, a milder one
  without it--or compromise and use only 1 Tbls.  Eliminate the chocolate.
  In Step 3, when the mixture begins to thicken, add 1 1/2 cups of pecan
  halves slowly so as not to break the boil or cool the mixture too quickly.
