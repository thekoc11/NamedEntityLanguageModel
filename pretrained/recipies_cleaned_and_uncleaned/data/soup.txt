1 1/2 cup chile caribe
1 1/2 oz milk chocolate,small pieces
1 can tomato paste(6oz ea)
2 tablespoon vinegar
3 teaspoon lemon juice
1 soft tortilla,chopped
1  salt

1. Place the rinsed beans in a bowl, add 2 to 3 cups of water and soak
overnight. Check the beans occasionally and add water as necessary to
keep them moist.

2. Pour the beans and the water in which they were soaked into a heavy
saucepan and add 2 to 3 more cups of water. Bring to a boil over
medium-high heat, then lower heat and simmer, partially covered, for
about 45 minutes, until the beans are cooked but still firm. Check
occasionally and add water if necessary. Drain the beans, reserving
the cooking liquid.

3. Melt the lard in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the beans
and lightly fry them in the lard. Set aside.

4. Melt the drippings in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add the
onion and cook until it is translucent.

5. Combine the sausage and the beef with all the spices up through the
oregano. Add this meat-and-spice mixture to the pot with the onion.
Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring occasionally, until
the meat is very well browned.

6. Add the reserved bean-cooking liquid to the pot. Stir in all the
remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and cook,
uncovered, for 1/2 hour longer. Stir occasionally. Add water only if
necessary to maintain the consistency of a chunky soup.

7. Taste when curiosity becomes unbearable and courage is strong.
Adjust seasonings.

A Bag Of Bean Tricks

beans, soups

1 text only

A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.

Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways
of preparing dry beans for cooking. All start with a thorough
inspection for damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in
cold water. The next step, which is highly recommended, is soaking
the beans. This not only helps make the beans cook faster, it also
improves flavor, texture, appearance and digestibility. For maximum
improvement of these factors, it is recommended that the soak water
be discarded and the beans rinsed and cooked in fresh water.

SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.

For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so
be sure to start with a large enough pot. (Note: up to 2 teaspoons of
salt per pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water
more evenly.) Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
from heat, cover and set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak
method), but *preferably* four hours or more.  The longer soaking
time is recommended to allow a greater amount of the gas-causing
properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping the beans to be
more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects. Whether you soak
the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to DISCARD THE SOAK
WATER.

COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)

Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
teaspoons salt. Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness
is reached.

Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons
onion salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt. Add 1
Tablespoon chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4
teaspoon white pepper.

* Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.

* Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.

* Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans
when cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.

* At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker
helps, but follow manufacturer's directions. [Personal note: Tom says
1/2 hour in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to
cooking them overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure
cooker, as they expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)

* Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or
kidney beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings,
lard, oil, butter or margarine.

A Lucky Accident

soups

3 small carrots cut in 2 pieces
2 small parsnips cut in 2 pieces
1 medium turnip  cut in chunks
2  stalks celery cut in 2 pieces
1  celery leaves from 1 whole bunch ce; lery
1 large onion stuck with 2 cloves
1 can tomato wedges * with liquid
4 oz tomato paste **
1 small bn flat-leaf parsley
1  bay leaf
1  fresh rosemary and thyme (i used a; lot)
1  black peppercorns

* This is what I happened to have on hand. Any canned tomatoes would
do.

** That's what I had leftover in the fridge. Use a 6oz can.

Put 3 quarts of water in the bottom of a large stock pot with a pasta
insert. Add the tomato liquid and tomato paste. Put all of the other
ingredients in the pasta insert. Bring to a boil over high heat,
lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 3 hours. Lift out the
pasta insert, letting out the liquid fall back into the pot. Press
down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible and return
all the liquid to the pot. Discard the solids.

Note: This started out to be vegetable stock to use up some leftover
stuff I had on hand, but after I strained the stock I decided to use
it as a cooking liquid for pasta. The pasta thickened and flavored
the stock to such an extent that I decided to save the leftovers to
use as a tomato-vegetable soup. I may add some vegetables and small
pasta to that.

African Vegetable Stew

stews

1  onion (very large), chopped
1  swiss chard bunch
1 can garbanzo beans (known also as chick; peas, ceci, etc.)
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup rice, raw
2  yams
1  several fresh tomatoes (or large ca; n)
1  garlic clove (or more to taste)
1  salt and pepper, to taste
1  tabasco sauce, to taste

Fry onion, garlic and white stems of chard until barely limp.  Add
chopped greens and fry a bit.

Either peel the yams or scrub them well with a vegetable brush, then
slice them into thick slices.  Add garbanzos, raisins, yams,
tomatoes, salt and pepper.  Cook a couple of minutes.

Make a well in the center of the mixture in the pot.  Put the rice in
the well and pat it down until it's wet. Cover and cook until rice is
done, about 25 minutes. Add Tabasco sauce to taste.

NOTES:

*  A spicy vegetable stew -- I got this recipe from my mom, who got
it from a friend. It's very easy to make.

*  I find that the flavors of the vegetables don't stand out unless
you put in a lot of tabasco. But then, I've got a cast-iron tongue.
You should add enough to make the stew seem spicy to you.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Amish Sauerkraut Soup

penndutch, soups

1 lb smoked sausage (kielbasa)
6 tablespoon onion; chopped
1/4 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
3 cup milk
1 cup half-and-half
8 oz sauerkraut, with juice
1 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)
2 tablespoon fresh parsley; chopped

Chop the sausage coarsely by hand or in a food processor (leave the
casing on).  Transfer the sausage and onion to a deep pan, and saute
over medium heat until the sausage is lightly browned, about 8
minutes.

On a small plate combine the flour, thyme, and pepper. Add to the
sausage and brown all together until the mixture bubbles up, about 5
minutes. Add the milk and the half-and-half all at once, and cook
stirring until the mixture again bubbles up, about 5 minutes.  Add
the sauerkraut and it juice and bring to a boil; the mixture will
continue to thicken. Taste for tartness, and lemon juice if desired.
Add the parsley and serve at once. From Cooking from Quilt Country by

1 1/2 cup dried pinto beans

3 green anaheim chiles, for garnish

Most southwestern Indians grow beans.  The Hopis grow a variety of
beans in terraces along their high mesas, where the crop is irrigated
by natural springs.  After the harvest the beans are dried and
stored. Some beans are used for ceremonial purposes - from weddings
to Kachina dances - while others are used for their day-to-day meals.

For suburban and city dwellers, I've found that pinto beans, white
beans, or red beans work well, but I suggest you also experiment with
some of the other varieties of beans - like anasazi beans - that are
now available commercially.  Or you may want to be adventuresome and
grow your own variety.  To round out this meal, the beans can be
served with Lamb Stuffed Green Chiles, Pan Fried Trout, or Venison

Antoine's Cream Of Mushroom Soup

soups

4 tablespoon butter
20 medium mushrooms; sliced
1/4 cup sherry
3 cup chicken stock
2 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup sherry
1 salt and pepper (to taste)
1 chicken-hazelnut quenelles
2 tablespoon hazelnuts; skins removed,  and chop

To roast the hazelnuts you should place them on a sheet pan and put
them in a 400F oven for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the outside skin
starts to break away.  Rub the hazelnuts together so that the outer
dark skins flake off. You do not want to toast them, you just want
the skin to loosen up.

In a large skillet place the butter and heat it on medium high until
it has melted.  Add the mushrooms and saut them for 4 to 5 minutes,
or until they are brown. Add the 1/4 cup of sherry and deglaze the
pan. Add the chicken stock.  Cook the ingredients on medium heat for
12 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced by 1/2.

In a small saucepan place the 3/4 cup of sherry.  Cook it on medium
high heat for 4 to 6 minutes, or until it is reduced by 3/4.

Add the reduced sherry, salt, and pepper to soup, and stir them in.

In each of 4 individual serving bowls place 3 of the Chicken-Hazelnut
Quenelles.  Ladle the soup on top. Sprinkle on the hazelnuts.

Ardshane House Irish Stew

cyberealm, ethnic, main dish, meats, stews

4 lb middle neck of lamb, cut in
1  one inch chunks
4 lb potatoes, peeled
10 small onions, sliced
2 oz pearl barley
2 pint beef stock
1  salt and pepper to taste

"That's the basic recipe. You can add a load of sliced carrots and
leeks to make it go further and about 5-6 tsps. of Worchestershire
sauce or regular brown sauce wot you Yanks pour over everything!! If
you like, you could add a half a pint of Guinness to your stock. I
make my stock from the potato peelings, carrot tops, leek ends, and
any other stuff I find lurking in the refrigerator. If you chuck in a
few moldy lamb bones and boil/simmer for several hours, you should
get a damned good stock (strain the liquid or you'll get God knows
what stuck in your teeth!!) You'll need to start with about 5 pints
of liquid. Then bung everything into a ginormous pan, bring to the
boil, and then simmer for about two hours...should taste bloody
orgasmic! Salt and pepper to taste, depending on your level of
drunkeness!!"

ARUGULA~ POTATO & LEEK SOUP

soups, vegetables

1 1/2 tablespoon oil
2 medium leek; trimmed, cleaned thoroug
1 medium onion; sliced (1 c)
1 teaspoon fennel seeds, ground
1 1/4 lb potato; peeled & coarsely cubed
3 cup chicken broth
1 1/2 cup ; water
10 oz arugula; washed, trimmed, to yiel
1 pepper & salt; as needed
2 tablespoon ricard or pernod
12 tablespoon yogurt
4 arugula leaf; finely slivered (garnish

Heat oil in large pot.  Add leeks and onion; cook over moderately low
heat, stirring often, until softened - about 10 min. Sprinkle with
fennel and stir 30 seconds.

Add potatoes, broth, and water.  Simmer 25 min, until soft. Add
arugula and cook about 10 min longer, or until stems are soft. Add
salt, pepper and liquor to taste.

Puree to rough or smooth texture, as you like.  Adjust seasoning.
Serve hot or chilled, topped with yogurt and garnished with arugula
slivers. As watercress changes potato soup into something that
doesn't taste quite like any of the individual ingredients, so
arugula transforms this traditional soup base.

Flexible, the soup can be pureed to a chunky or a smooth texture, and
served hot, as a main dish, or chilled, as a first course.

1/4 teaspoon salt
8 cup water
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup rice
1 cup spinach, chopped
1 cup parsley, chopped
1/2 cup green onions, chopped
1 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds or
1 cup pomegranate juice
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon lime juice (optional)
      ----SPICE FOR SOUP----
1 tablespoon dried mint
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon pepper
      ----PREPARATION----

Put the meat in a bowl.  Add grated onions and seasoning and mix
well. Make meat balls the size of walnuts. Put water in a 3 qt pot.
Add salt and rice and let cook for 15 minutes.  Add vegetables and
let cook for another 15 minutes.  Cut fresh pomegranate and take out
the seeds to make about 1 1/2 cups.  Add meat balls, pomegranate
seeds, and sugar to the soup and let cook for another 20 minutes on a
low fire or until the meat is done.

Rub dried mint in the palm of your hands to make it powdery. Add
cinnamon and pepper to the mint.  Add this to the soup just before
removing it from the fire.

Taste soup, and if needed add more salt and lime juice for the right
flavoring.  If the pomegranate is sweet it will require lime juice.

This is a popular winter soup.

Ashkenazic Chicken Soup & Matzo Balls With Fr

jewish, soups

2 lb chicken wings or drumsticks
9 cup cold water
1 large onion, peeled
1 large carrot, peeled
1 small parsnip, peeled (opt)
2 celery stalks, including leafy tops
5 parsley sprigs
3 dill sprigs
1  salt
1  pepper
1 tablespoon snipped fresh dill
      ----MATZO BALLS----
2 large eggs
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup matzo meal
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon water or chicken soup
2 quart salted water for simmering

Combine chicken wings, water, onion, carrot, parsnip, celery, parsley
and dill sprigs, and pinch of salt to a large saucepan and bring to a
boil. Partly cover and simmer 2 hours, skimming occasionally. Skim
off excess fat. (Chicken soup can be kept 3 days in refrigerator or
can be frozen; reheat before serving.)

Make matzo balls: In a medium bowl, lightly beat eggs with oil. Add
matzo meal, salt and stir until smooth. Stir in water, then let
mixture stand for 20 minutes so matzo meal absorbs liquid.

Bring salted water to a boil. With wet hands, roll about 1 teaspoon of
matzo ball mixture between your palms into a ball; mixture will be
very soft. Set balls on a plate. With a rubber spatula, carefully
slide balls into boiling water. Cover and simmer over low heat for
about 30 minutes or until firm. Cover and keep warm until ready to
serve. (Matzo balls can be kept 2 days in their cooking liquid in a
covered container in refrigerator; reheat gently in cooking liquid or
in soup.)

To serve soup, remove chicken wings, onion, celery, parsnip, parsley
and dill sprigs. Take meat off bones and add to soup; or reserve for
other uses. Add pepper to soup, stir in snipped dill and taste soup
for seasoning. Slice carrot and add a few slices to each bowl. With a
slotted spoon, add a few matzo balls. Serve hot.

Asparagus & Sesame Chicken Soup

chinese, poultry

2 lb chicken
3 tablespoon sesame oil
6 slice ginger root
1/2 cup medium sherry
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup warm water
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup button mushrooms, canned
8  fresh asparagus spears

This recipe was inspired by a memorable soup first tasted in Taipei.
It has its origins in Fujian, only 125 miles from the Straits of
Taiwan.

Preparation:  Rinse chicken, remove fat pockets, pat dry, and chop
into bite-size pieces.  NOTE:  if tempted to use breast meat without
bones, please don`t; bones add to body and flavor of soup.  Peel and
slice ginger root.  Wash and cut asparagus into 2" sections.

Braising:  Heat wok to medium hot.  Add sesame oil.  Start braising
chicken a few pieces at a time when oil begins to smell.  Sesame oil
will burn at lower temperature than other cooking oils, so avoid hot
wok. After browning lightly, return chicken pieces to wok; add ginger
slices, sherry and salt. When sherry boils, add water and sugar. Turn
up heat, bring to boil, then reduce heat to simmer, cover and simmer
for 30 minutes. Add mushrooms and asparagus, simmer for another 15
minutes.

Transfer to covered soup tureen (or put plate on top of soup bowl),
place in steamer on low, and hold until ready to serve.

You can make this soup in large sauce pan, if wok is needed for some-
thing else.

      ----PARSLEY BUTTER----
1/3 cup parsley; fresh minced
3 tablespoon butter, unsalted; softened
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
      ----SOUP----
1/4 cup butter, unsalted
3  leeks, large; chopped *
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme; crumbled
1 bay leaf
6 cup chicken stock/canned broth
1 1/2 lb potatoes, red new; quartered
1 lb asparagus; trimmed,1diagonal

* Leeks: Use the white part and only 1 inch of the green part.

Parsley butter: Mix the first 4 ingredients in small bowl. (Can be
prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room
temperature before using).

Melt 1/4 cup unsalted butter in heavy large saucepan over low heat.
Add leeks, thyme and bay leaf.  Cover and cook until leeks are soft,
stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Mix in stock and potatoes.
Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until potatoes are

crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls. Top each with dollop of
parsley butter and serve.

This sounded very good, but my husband likes cream soups, so I added
a FL sweet onion to the potato mixture and pureed all before I added
the asparagus to the creamy soup. Adapted from Bon Appetit, April
1991.

Azafran Soup With Spinach Greens & Yellow Cornmeal Dumpli

soups

      ----YELLOW CORNMEAL DUMPLINGS----
1 cup ground yellow cornmeal
3/4 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white pepper
2 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon unsalted butter, softened
2 cup chicken stock
      ----AZAFRAN SOUP----
6 cup water
2 tablespoon azafran (see note)
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
3 cup chicken stock
2 yellow summer squash, diced
3 cup corn kernels
1 bunch spinach, washed and stemmed

To make the dumplings, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder,
salt, pepper, and sugar together in a bowl.  Add the butter and milk
and mix well to make a batter that is moist but not sticky.  If the
dough is too moist, knead in a little more flour.  Divide the dough
into 1" balls, flatten, and shape into small triangles.

Pour the chicken stock into a pot and bring to a boil over medium
heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and drop in the dumplings.  Cook 3
to 4 minutes, until tender and cooked all the way through.  Remove
the dumplings from the stock and set aside.

For the soup, heat 2 cups of the water and the azafran in a large
saucepan over medium-high heat until the liquid has reduced by half,
about 7 minutes.  Pour through a fine sieve, discard the azafran, and
return the liquid to the saucepan.  Add salt, pepper, stock, and the
remaining 4 cups of the water and bring to a boil over medium-high
heat. Add squash, reduce the heat ans simmer 5 minutes.  Add cork
kernels and simmer another 5 minutes.  Add dumplings and spinach,
cook 2 minutes, and serve immediately.

**Note**  Azafran, also called Native American saffron my the American
Indians, is an herb that is actually fine threads from the stigma of
the safflower plant.  Despite the name, azafran is not the same as
saffron, which is an expensive spice derived from the crocus plant in
the iris family.  (Saffron can be substituted for azafran, though:
use 1 pinch of saffran for 2 tablespoons of azafran).

Azafran is commonly sold in Latin American markets and specialty herb
stores.  It can also be ordered by mail.  It is best stored in a cool
dark place and will last several months in a sealed plastic or glass
container.

Baby Doe's Mine Beer Cheese Soup

cheese/eggs, soups/stews

8 cup milk
2 teaspoon tabasco sauce
4 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
4 tablespoon chicken base *
16 oz cheeze whiz
6 tablespoon cornstarch
1/3 cup water
1 cup beer
1/8 teaspoon msg (i did not use)
1 cayenne pepper

Combine milk, Tabasco, Worcestershire, chicken base, & MSG. Bring to a
boil, stirring regularly.

Add Cheeze Whiz, after warming in hot water or in microwave. Mix in
well.

Dissolve cornstarch completely in the water.  Add to soup, which
should thicken immediately.  Reduce heat a bit and stir in beer.

To serve, ladle into bowls and dust with cayenne pepper.

*Chicken base can be found in the spice section.  I used Schilling's
Chicken Flavor Base.  Spice Islands also has a product called Chicken
Flavor Stock Base that is probably the same thing.

I would like to give credit to Scott Hammon, whose extra efforts
succeeded in wrangling this recipe from Baby Doe's chef. Since it's
been many years since I sampled this soup at the restaurant in
Dallas, I can't judge how closely this approximates the original.
But at least the results are tasty! Hope all who try it will enjoy it.

Bacon & Bean Soup

vegetables

1 cup dry pinto or other beans
1 quart water; or more, hot
1  ham bone: or
1/4 lb salt pork; diced or
1/4 lb back bacon; cubed
1/2 teaspoon salt; or to taste
2  ribs celery, chopped
1 medium carrot; chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
1/3 cup turnip; diced
2  bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon sage; [optional]
1/2 teaspoon louisiana hot sauce; or
1 teaspoon prepared mustard; [opt'l]
1 tablespoon parsley; chopped

Wash and pick over the beans, removing stones, loose skins and
shriveled beans. Put in a large covered pot and cover with hot
water. Soak over night if you want to cut down on cooking time.
When beans start to simmer add ham bone, salt pork or bacon. Add
more water as needed but only hot or boiling water. Do not add
cold water as the beans will turn dark. If you cook without a lid
the beans will also turn a dark color. Do not salt until the beans
are cooked.

Remove the hambone from the pot, pick the meat from it and return
the meat to the pot. Add the other ingredients except the parsley
to the pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15
minutes or until vegetables are tender. Remove the bay leaves and
ladle into warm soup tureen or soup bowls. Garnish with fresh
minced parsley. This soup tastes even better if it is rested and
re-heated the second day.

Bacon Cawl With Three Sauces

sauces, soups/stews

      ----THE CAWL----
1 1/2 lb collar bacon with rind
3 pint water
      ----VEGETABLES----
1 1/2 lb potatoes
1 small swede (rutabaga)
3 mature carrots
2 large leeks (or spring onions)
2 tablespoon chopped parsley
      ----SAUCES FOR THE MEAT----
      ----MUSTARD AND EGG SAUCE----
2 oz butter
1 oz flour
1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon powdered tumeric
1/2 pint cawl stock & milk mixed
1 hard-boiled egg
1 tablespoon vinegar
      ----SPICED TOMATO KETCHUP----
1 lb ripe tomatoes
1 small onion
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon powdered cloves
1 oz sugar
1 tablespoon malt vinegar
1 salt and pepper
1 small green chili (optional)
      ----PARSLEYANDCHIVE SAUCE----
1 oz butter
1 oz flour
1/2 pint cawl stock and milk mixed
2 tablespoon (heaped chopped parsley
1 tablespoon (heaped chopped chives
1 salt and pepper

Wash the joint to remove surface blood.  Put the meat into a large
clean pan and cover well with water. Bring to the boil, then turn the
heat down, cover with lid and simmer for 2 hours. Top up if the water
sinks below the level of the meat - at the end of the cooking you
should have 2 pints of liquor.  Leave it to cool, meat and all, and
lift off the white hat of grease (it makes good dripping after
heating gently to drive off the water).  Some families like the fat
left in.

Prepare the vegetables - scrub, peel and cut them into bite-sized
chunks as appropriate.  Wash and slice the leeks into 1/2-inch rings.
Then make the sauces.

For the MUSTARD AND EGG SAUCE: Melt 1 oz butter in a small pan. When
it froths, sprinkle in the flour and fry for a moment until mixture
is sandy. Stir in the mustard powder and tumeric and immediately
whisk in the broth and milk.  Whisk till the mixture thickens. Chop
the egg and stir in. Finish with the vinegar and beat in the extra
ounce of butter. Taste and add salt and pepper.

For the SPICED TOMATO KETCHUP: Chop the tomatoes, skin and chop the
onion. Put all the ingredients except the optional chili into a
lidded saucepan. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat, leave to
simmer gently for 30 minutes.  Push the contents of the pan and boil
it fiercely for a few minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve
either hot or cold. Finish with a few slices of deseeded chili if you
like it hot.

For the PARSLEY-AND-CHIVE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a small pan, stir
in the flour and let it cool for a moment. Whisk in the liquid
gradually and stir over the heat until the mixture thickens. Mix in
the herbs, taste and add salt and pepper.  Reheat the meat in its
broth (the cawl). Remove the meat and keep it warm while you cook the
root vegetables in the broth. Five minutes before you are ready to
serve, add the leeks. While the vegetables simmer, plain-boil the
potatoes separately. Stir the chopped parsley into the soup just
before you bring it to table.

As a second course, serve the meat with the potatoes, and the three
sauces.

Bajan Black Bean Soup

beans, crockpot, p-cooker, pork

2 1/2 cup dried black beans* soaked - overnig; ht
1 large or 2 small ham hocks
3  to 3.5 quarts water
3 tablespoon olive oil
2  to 3 large onions
4  cloves garlic
3 small fresh green peppers (jalapeanos if; preferred)
8  berries allspice coarsely crushed
2 teaspoon brown sugar (or 1 t of molasses)
3 tablespoon tomato paste
3/4 cup creme fraiche or sour cream

*P-cooker just add to pressure cooker...never need to soak,
unless you think about...I usally don't.:-))))
:
Salt Grated rind and juice from one lemon

Put the drained beans and hock in a very large pan, cover with the
cold water and bring gradually to a boil.  Leave to simmer while you
prepare the other ingredients.

In a frying pan heat the olive oil, then gently fry the onion, garlic
and chili with the allspice and lemon rind, stirring occasionally,
until the onions are translucent.  Add this mixture to the beans and
go on simmering for 2 hours, by which time the beans should be
tender.  At this point add the sugar, lemon juice, and tomato puree.
Cook for another 30 minutes. Add salt if necessary.

Remove the hock, and pick off any meat.  If you would like a smooth
soup, as mine (the author) was, process the mixture in batches and
return with the meat to the pan.  Otherwise, for a rougher texture
crush with a potato masher.  If the mixture seems too thick at this
stage, add more water and bring back to the boil for a minute or two.

Ladle the soup into bowls, with a spoonful or two of cream stirred
in, and serve with a crusty bread.

If you are feeling lavish, a couple of spoons of dark rum added
towards the end give a Bajan fillip.

INFO TEXT: Arriving stiff and crumpled inside and out after an eleven
hour flight, this was my first taste of Bajan Cooking, and I ate it
late at night trying to imagine the sea beyond a dark frieze of
langourous palms. Dense but smooth, with a snap of chili, the soup
was both homely and exotic, and very restoring.

Barbados produces splendid ham and bacon, and a ham stock is what
makes this different from other Carribean variants.  Or, as here, use
a hock, soaked first to remove some salt.

Baked Garlic Soup With Herb Toast

soups

1 head garlic
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar -- or
1  brandy
1 sprig fresh rosemary --
1  (3-inch)
1  soup:
3 cup vegetable broth
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 salt and pepper -- to taste
1 herb toast:
1/2 loaf bread -- see note

add the broth and wine. Heat to a simmer over medium-low heat and
cook for 15 minutes. While cooking, make the herb toast. Bake the
bread slices on a baking sheet until crisp but not golden, 6 to 8
minutes. Rub the bread with the cut sides of the garlic clove, then
brush generously with oil. Sprinkle on a thin layer of the Parmesan
cheese and chives. Bake until the cheese is melted, another 5
minutes. Serve immediately with the hot soup.

Substitution for the Chinese garlic chives: 1 clove garlic and twice
as much volumn of fresh chives.

NOTES : Two stage process. First, roast/bake the garlic. Second, use
roasted garlic to flavor a broth. Serve with herb toast. Make extra!
Garlic paste can be added to mashed potatoes, served with meats or
vegetables, or simply spread on slices of toasted Italian bread.

Barb's Potato Soup

soups

      ----BARB DAY----
4 slice bacon; diced
1 large onion; diced (see note)
2 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 cup cabbage; chopped
12 oz chicken broth
3 large potatoes; peeled, diced salt and p
1 cup egg noodles
2 cup milk
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon butter

Note: I like to prepare onion by placing it in a covered vessel and
placing it in the microwave on high, (skin on) for about 5 minutes.
When the onion is done, the skin can be slipped off easily, and the
onion chopped.  This is equivalent to sauteeing to the point where
the onion is translucent, but for this dish the onion still needs to
be sauteed. Using this method cuts out the tears and most of the
odor, not to mention, no use of fat! Cook the bacon in the butter
until it is lightly browned, then add the onion and cook for a few
minutes, until the onion just begins to brown. Add the cabbage, and
cook until it is very limp. Now add the diced potatoes, and chicken
stock. Salt and pepper to taste.
Cover and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender. Add the
noodles on top of the mixture, and cover again. Cook for about 6 to
eight minutes, or until the noodles are almost done.
Add the milk and cream, and the 2 tablespoons of butter, and correct
seasonings. Stir and cover the pan again. Cook over low heat just
until warmed through.
Serving Note:  You might like a little crisp fried, crumbled bacon
and/or chopped chives or green onion tops as a tasty garnish.

Barley Broth With Chicken

poultry, soup/stew

2 oz pot barley
2 1/2 pint good quality chicken stock
1  lemon
1 fat garlic clove
2  leeks
1/4 lb mushrooms
2 chicken livers, if available
1 cold cooked chicken meat *
5 tablespoon coarsley chopped parsley
1 small knob butter

*Note: The recipe calls for 1-2 chicken livers, if available, and
"shreds of cold cooked chicken meat, if available".

Grate the zest of the lemon very finely and reserve it. Put the
barley into a soup pan, add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and cold chicken
stock. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for about 40 minutes until
the barley is tender with just a hint of bite to the centre of the
grain. Add the chicken meat, if used, to the pan towards the end of
this time to heat it through gently but thoroughly.

When the barley is nearly ready, slice the mushrooms thickly, and
slice the leeks (tender green parts as well as the white) very thinly
indeed so that the leaves fall into ribbony shreds. Cut the chicken
livers, if available, into 2 to 3 pieces and saute them briefly in
the butter until crusty on the outside but still pink within. Fry the
mushrooms in the fat remaining in the pan then reduce the heat and
cook the leeks gently for 2 to 3 minutes, just shaking occasionally.
Then add contents of the frying pan to the soup pan.  Add the
mushrooms and check seasoning.

Put the chicken livers into a warmed soup tureen and crush with a
fork to make a coarse paste.  Add the finely chopped garlic, the
lemon zest and most of the parsley. Pour on the piping hot soup, stir
to mix well, sprinkle the rest of the parsley on top and serve.

Note: If the soup is not served straight away, but allowed to get
cold, the barley will go on swelling and softening; when reaheated
the dish then seems more like a stew than a soup. I like it this way
but you may prefer to lift out the grain and cool it down separately
from the rest of the soup.

Basic Cream Soup

vegetarian

1 medium onion
1 medium celery stalk
1 medium garlic clove
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 cup vegetable; chopped in 1/2 to 1-inch
1  cauliflower
1  asparagus
1  broccoli
1  any other vegetable
5 cup ; water
2 tablespoon miso, light or
2  vegetable bouillon cubes
1  pepper, freshly ground, opt.

1. Bring water to a boil in a tea kettle. Coarsely
chop the onion and celery. Thinly slice the garlic.

2.  In a soup pot, heat oil, onion, garlic and celery.
Cook and stir 1 minute over medium heat, then add
vegetable. Continue cooking and stirring 1 minute
longer.

3. Add boiling water and bring back to a boil over
high heat. Stir briefly and reduce heat to medium.
Cover and cook 8 minutes. Lift cover, stir in miso,
and continue cooking and stirring for another 2
minutes, until miso is dissolved and vegetables are
tender. (At this point, you may puree soup directly in
the pot with a hand blender, liquefying a small amount
of soup with the tahini in a separate bowl and
returning it to the pot. Or, follow steps 4-6.

4. Pour soup into a bowl to cool. Remove 1/2 cup of
broth from soup and stir remaining soup to cool it.
While soup is cooling, place tahini and 1/2 cup broth
in a blender. Blend to a smooth cream. Set aside.

5.  Place three-fourths of soup in blender and
liquefy to a cream. Pour into original soup pot. Place
remaining one-quarter of unblended soup in a blender.
Pulse-blend for 2 to 3 seconds, allowing mixture to
remain lumpy and textured. Pour it into creamed
portion in the original soup pot.

6. Place soup over medium heat and stir in tahini
mixture. Gently reheat soup, taking care not to let it
boil and stirring frequently. Add pepper to taste.

Variations:

If you don't have light miso, substitute 2 vegetable
bouillon cubes, 2 tbs powdered vegetable broth, or 5
cups of homemade stock in place of 5 cups water.

Creamed soups can be served hot or cold. If serving
cold, skip the reheating.

Add 1/2 tsp dried thyme, basil or marjoram to the
sauteeing vegetables for fuller flavor.

Add 1 tbs nutritional yeast to the soup pot when you
add the water.

Note: After the tahini mixture has been added to the
cream soup, boiling will make the tahini itself
thicken and the soup will be too thick. Take care to
reheat it GENTLY, _not_to_boil_!

Basic Critter Stock

ethnic, soup/stew

      ----BASIC----
2 quart cold water
1 med. onion, (see note)
1 large clove garlic (note)
1  bones, excess meat (notes)
      ----FOWL AND GAME STOCKS----
1 1/2 lb backs, necks, bones (notes)
      ----BEEF OR TURTLE STOCK----
2 lb beef shank (see notes)
      ----PORK STOCK----
2 lb pork neck bones (see notes)
      ----SEAFOOD STOCK----
2 lb rinsed shrimp heads (notes)

Notes:  To the basic stock, you can also add vegetable trimmings from
the recipe(s) you are serving, in place of the onion, garlic and
celery. The recipe calls for the onion and garlic to be unpeeled and
quartered.
Also, you may include bones and any excess meat (excluding livers)
from meat or poultry, or shells or carcasses from seafood, used in
the recipe(s) you're cooking, or FOR FOWL AND GAME STOCKS: 1 1/2 to 2
pounds backs, necks and/or bones from chickens, guinea hens, ducks,
geese, rabbits, etc. FOR BEEF OR TURTLE STOCKS: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds
beef shank (preferred) or other beef or turtle bones. FOR PORK STOCK:
1-1/2 to 2 pounds pork neck bones (preferred) or other pork bones.
FOR SEAFOOD STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds rinsed shrimp heads and/or
shells, or crawfish heads and/or shells, or crab shells (2-1/2 to 3
quarts), or rinsed fish carcasses (heads and gills removed), or any
combination of these. (you can also substitute oyster liquor for all
or part of seafood stock called for in a recipe). NOTE: If desired,
you can first roast meat bones and vegetables at 350F until
thoroughly browned. Then use them to make your basic stock. (When you
brown the bones and vegetables, the natural sugar in both caramelizes
on the surface, which gives the stock a fuller taste and adds color
when it dissolves in the stock water.) Always start with cold
water--enough to cover the other stock ingredients.
Place all ingredients in a stock pot or a large saucepan. Bring to a
boil over high heat, then gently simmer at least 4 hours, preferably
8 (unless directed otherwise in a recipe), replenishing the water as
needed to keep about 1 quart of liquid in the pan. The pot may be
uncovered, or set the lid on it askew. Strain, cool and refrigerate
until ready to use.
(Note: Remember if you are short on time, using a stock simmered 20
to 30 minutes is far better than using just water in any recipe..) TO
MAKE A RICH STOCK: Strain the basic stock, then continue simmering
until evaporation reduces the liquid by half or more. For example, if
your recipe calls for 1 cup "Rich Stock," start it with at least 2
cups of strained basic stock. (Rich stocks are needed when a sauce
requires lots of taste but only a limited amount of liquid, for
example, "Oyster Sauce for Beef." From The Prudhomme Family Cookbook

Basic Guidelines For Making Vegetable Stock

soups

2 quart cold water
8 cup vegetables -- cut into 1
1  pieces

First choose the ingredients to reflect the soup in which the broth is
being used. A general guideline for making vegetable broth is to use
about 8 to 12 cups of vegetables cut into pieces no bigger than 1
inch. Put these with 2 quarts of cold water in a large nonreactive
pot with no more than six different herbs. Bring to a boil over high
heat, then lower the heat and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Strain and
use as is or concentarte the flavor by simmering to the desired
strength (by taste).

When using dried herbs, lessen quantities by one-half to two-thirds
but always add *to taste*

vegetable: carrots, celery, potatoes, winter squash, summer squash,
chard, kale, tomatoes, mushrooms, eggplant, lettuce, green beans,
celeriac When available use: fennel bulbs, asparagus, peas herbs
(limit 6): basil, bay, borage, garlic, garlic chives, hyssop, lovage,
morjoram, oregano, parsley, sage, savory, thyme spices (limit 2)
coriander, cumin, cardamon, fennel seeds, whole cloves, cinnamon

NOTES : Stock is very personal. It's quickly prepared. Or make ahead
and freeze in a size that's convenient for you. -- Maggie Cabbage
family vegetables were left off the list of ingredients because they
give a strong (dominant) flavor; the flavor grows stronger (ages in
the freezer). If you like, use mild cabbages: napa, bok choy, a
little savoy, young brussels. Or use chard and endive. When using
cabbage, try to use the broth right away. Also, straining is
important.  Use a very fine sieve. -- Maggie and patH

Basic Gumbo

soups

1 cup vegetable oil (or lard) plus more t; o fry chicken
1 cup flour
1  chicken cut up or boned
1 1/2 lb andouille sausage (if available) or; polish sausage
1  hillshire farms is a good choice fo; r the polish sausage

2 cup chopped celery
2 cup chopped green pepper
2 tablespoon chopped garlic

Sherry may be added at the table.  Gumbo can be served alone or with
rice. File (fee-lay [powdered sassafras]) may be added at the table
as a thickener

If you prefer, okra may be added; 4 to 6 cups add to vegetables and
cook with the roux.

Basic Stock - Prudhomme

cajun, soups

      ----BASIC----
2 quart cold water
1 med. onion, (see note)
1 large clove garlic (note)
1  bones, excess meat (notes)
      ----FOWL AND GAME STOCKS----
1 1/2 lb backs, necks, bones (notes)
      ----BEEF OR TURTLE STOCK----
2 lb beef shank (see notes)
      ----PORK STOCK----
2 lb pork neck bones (see notes)
      ----SEAFOOD STOCK----
2 lb rinsed shrimp heads (notes)

Notes:  To the basic stock, you can also add vegetable trimmings from
the recipe(s) you are serving, in place of the onion, garlic and
celery. The recipe calls for the onion and garlic to be unpeeled and
quartered.
Also, you may include bones and any excess meat (excluding livers)
from meat or poultry, or shells or carcasses from seafood, used in
the recipe(s) you're cooking, or FOR FOWL AND GAME STOCKS: 1 1/2 to 2
pounds backs, necks and/or bones from chickens, guinea hens, ducks,
geese, rabbits, etc. FOR BEEF OR TURTLE STOCKS: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds
beef shank (preferred) or other beef or turtle bones. FOR PORK STOCK:
1-1/2 to 2 pounds pork neck bones (preferred) or other pork bones.
FOR SEAFOOD STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds rinsed shrimp heads and/or
shells, or crawfish heads and/or shells, or crab shells (2-1/2 to 3
quarts), or rinsed fish carcasses (heads and gills removed), or any
combination of these. (you can also substitute oyster liquor for all
or part of seafood stock called for in a recipe). NOTE: If desired,
you can first roast meat bones and vegetables at 350F until
thoroughly browned.
Then use them to make your basic stock.  (When you brown the bones
and vegetables, the natural sugar in both caramelizes on the surface,
which gives the stock a fuller taste and adds color when it dissolves
in the stock water.) Always start with cold water--enough to cover
the other stock ingredients.  Place all ingredients in a stock pot or
a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then gently simmer
at least 4 hours, preferably 8 (unless directed otherwise in a
recipe), replenishing the water as needed to keep about 1 quart of
liquid in the pan. The pot may be uncovered, or set the lid on it
askew.  Strain, cool and refrigerate until ready to use.  (Note:
Remember if you are short on time, using a stock simmered 20 to 30
minutes is far better than using just water in any recipe..) TO MAKE
A RICH STOCK: Strain the basic stock, then continue simmering until
evaporation reduces the liquid by half or more. For example, if your
recipe calls for 1 cup "Rich Stock," start it with at least 2 cups of
strained basic stock.  (Rich stocks are needed when a sauce requires
lots of taste but only a limited amount of liquid, for example,
"Oyster Sauce for Beef." From The Prudhomme Family Cookbook

Basic Vegetable Soup

soups, vegetables, healthwise

3 cup beef broth -- *see note
2 cup water
1 cup tomato juice
2 potatoes -- medium size
3 carrots -- diced
1 small onion -- diced
2 celery stalks -- diced
1/4 cup green peppers -- diced
1/2 cup green beans -- chopped
1/2 cup lima beans
1/2 cup corn
4 tablespoon margarine -- solid
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt -- or to taste

* Use about 6 cups liquid. You may mix chicken and beef broth (canned
lowfat, not bouillon cubes) with water and tomato juice or vegetable
juice cocktail to suit your tastes.

1. Melt 4 tablespoons margarine in skillet. Add the chopped green
peppers, carrots, celery and onion. Saute on low heat until
vegetables are softened and onion browned lightly. Add this to the
broth mixture which has been placed in a large, heavy pan with lid.

2. Add to this the potatoes, green beans, lima beans and corn. Cover
and simmer for about 45 minutes or until all the vegetables are done.
Add the salt and pepper.

3. Remove about 2 cups of the mixture and put into blender. Puree this
mixture and return to pot with rest of soup. Turn off heat and cover
soup. Best if allowed to set for up to 1 hour to blend flavors. Since
this is a basic recipe for soup, you can add the vegetables you
prefer and follow the directions above to finish the soup. Some
suggestions: Add bay leaf, shredded cabbage, chopped zucchini, diced
turnips, fresh tomatoes, okra or parsley. For added nutrition, serve
with a sprinkling of lowfat cheese on the hot soup. Also good
sprinkled with toasted croutons. This stores very well in
refrigerator and is actually improved with time.

Bazaar Vegetable Soup

soups, vegetables

10 cup cold water
3/4 cup green split peas
2 tablespoon pearl barley
1/4 cup baby lima beans
2 cup sliced carrots
1 large onion, diced
1 handful of celery tops, cut up
4 tablespoon commercial chicken soup base
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 teaspoon dillweed
1 pinch sugar
1/4 cup buckshot (pellet shaped pasta)

Salt & pepper to taste

Place water in stock pot.  Add split peas, pearl barley and lima
beans. Cook until peas are mush.  Add carrots, onion, celery tops,
chicken soup base, butter or margarine, dill weed, sugar, pasta, salt
and pepper. Cook slowly until vegetables are done.  Stir frequently
to prevent scorching on bottom.  May be frozen. More water may be
added to soup if too thick. Cook for 3 to 4 hours.

Makes 8 to 10 servings.

NOTE:  This recipe was developed by a woman who sells the soup at
Hadassah Bazaars.  She says the secret to the soup is long slow
cooking and the addition of the dill weed. It's a very tasty one!

Bean & Bacon Soup ( Revised )

beans, german, jw, pork

1 lb navy beans,dried
6 cup water
4 cup beef broth
1  carrot, chopped
1  celery stalk, chopped
4  thick slices of bacon; diced
2  onions, chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon thyme or sage
6  frankfurter sausages; sliced
2 tablespoon parsley; chopped

Soak beans overnight. Drain. In a 3-quart soup pot bring beans,
water and beef broth to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer an hour or
more until beans are tender. Add carrot and celery and continue
cooking for 30 minutes.  In a separate pan cook the bacon until
almost done.  Add the onions; cook until golden. Set aside. Mash
soup through a sieve or use a food mill.  Return the puree to the
pot, add the bacon onion mixture and seasonings. Reheat. Add the
Frankfurters and cook about 5 min. Serve and garnish each bowl
with parsley.

Optional: You can also add garlic and red pepper [but it wouldn't be
German any more!] or substitute diced cooked smoked hocks or ham for
the bacon. Or cook the carrot and celery separately and add them to
the soup after it has been pureed, so that it has some texture.

Also reserve a cup of whole beans from the puree and add back to
the soup later.

BEAN~ BARLEY & SAUSAGE SOUP

crockpot, main dish, work food

      ----IOWA REC NEWS, MAY 1992----
1 lb kidney beans, dry
1 pkg smoked polish sausage,sliced
7 cup water
1 cup barley
2 garlic cloves; peeled
3 bay leaves

Put rinsed beans in large saucepan. Add water, cover and let stand
overnight.

Drain off water the next day. Put beans, barley and remaining
ingredients into crockpot.  Stir.  Cover and cook on high for 4
hours. Remove bay leaves.  Salt to taste when serving.

Sylvia's comments:  I nuked the beans to fast-soak them, and it worked
great.  Even the kids liked this one! I used a fine-ground wurst
instead of Polish sausage and cut it into bite-sized pieces before
cooking. I also added some powdered beef stock to the water for
cooking. Then I packed the soup into empty jars to take to work. It
reheats great! Also worked well for a quick supper for the kids.
Definitely a keeper. I might add some chopped browned onions next
time, though.

Bea's Unstuffed Cabbage

ground beef, soups

1 onion diced (1 cup)
2 lb head green cabbage,dice
8 oz tomato sauce
28 oz can peeled tomatoes & juice
1 cup water
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/3 cup raisins
1 lb ground beef or veal or lamb
1/2 cup raw white rice
1 teaspoon worchestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
1 ground pepper to taste

NOTE:  This has a long cooking time.  It is a dish that is best
prepared early in the day and reheated at serving time since the
flavor improves. NOTE:  Ms. Brody says that this dish could easily
feed a crowd if you have a pot or pots big enough to double or
guadruple, etc. it.

1.  In a large heavy pot combine all the soup ingredients except the
raisins.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat while preparing the
meatballs.

2.  Combine meatball ingredients, stirring them to mix thoroughly.
With wet hands, roll the meat mixture in 1 1/4" balls. Add the
meatballs to the boiling cabbage soup, reduce the heat to medium-low,
cover and simmer for 2 hours.

3.  Remove the cover, add the raisins, and cook for another 30
minutes in the uncovered pot.

She suggests that mashed potatoes would be an excellent accompaniment.
Also, that the dish goes well with broad egg noodles.

Beef & Onion Stew

ethnic, main dish, meats, stews

1 lb leftover beef (preferably
1  from pot-au-feu, or from
1  roast beef) sliced as thinly
1  as possible
4 tablespoon butter
3 medium yellow onions, sliced thinly
1  and separated into rings
1  flour
1 tablespoon plus, red wine vinegar, to
1  taste
1  stock, pot-au-feu broth, or
1  canned beef broth.
1 small bay leaf
1  sprig fresh thyme, or sub-
1  stitute 1 t dried.
1 tablespoon dijon-type mustard, or to
1  taste
1  fresh bread crumbs
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2  lemon, juice

-MIKE'S KITCHEN-

This recipe is an excellent use for leftover beef. Though there are
several variations possible for a Miroton (mushrooms, tomatoes,
garlic), the predominate flavor is always onions, which are made into
a sharp sauce. Preferably, the leftover beef will be from a
pot-au-few that has been tenderized by long poaching, but roast beef
can work as well. It will just need more baking time. The following
is my favorite variation for a Miroton:
Make sure the beef is chilled for easy slicing. Then, slice as
thinly as possible. Set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter
and lightly saute the onions. When golden and very soft, about 10
minutes, sprinkle them with enough flour to make a light roux. Stir
the mixture thoroughly for 2 - 3 minutes before adding the vinegar
and mustard. Continue stirring, adding enough stock or Pot-au-Feu
broth to make a thin sauce. Add the spices. Bring the sauce to a
boil, then lower heat and simmer for about 30 minutes.
Assembly: Pour a layer of sauce into a shallow baking dish.
Layer meat slices, always overlapping, alternating with more of the
sauce. You should end up with a final layer of sauce. Bake, covered,
in a 350 degree oven for half an hour, if meat was originally
poached, or for an hour, if roast beef. Check to make sure sauce does
not reduce too much. Add more stock if necessary.
When preliminary cooking is finished, sprinkle surface of dish
with a thick coating of fresh bread crumbs. Spoon just enough butter
over crumbs to moisten them. Return to oven for about 30 more
minutes, or until a golden crust forms. Sprinkle the top with the
parsley to garnish, and squeeze over it the juice of half a lemon.
Serve at once.
Variations: Add tomatoes, garlic, and/or mushrooms. Instead of
vinegar, use a little grated horseradish. In place of some of the
stock, use wine. This dish is very flexible. It is also economical,
but it doesn't taste like it!

Beef Essence Or Extract

basics, info/tips, stock

1  info

"To cook a heap of bones, beef and vegetables in a big pot for many
hours and have to show for it a small jar or two of meat essence is
truly making a molehill out of a mountain--but such a molehill!
Possessing a batch of this essence--glace de viande, is like having 8
quarts of strong beef stock miraculously confined in a small
container.  Use it any time you like and keep it as long as you care
to--it is virtually immortal if frozen and keeps several weeks
refrigerated.

Add a Tbsp. of the essence to a cup of boiling water and you have
better and beefier broth than any you can buy canned, cubed, or
powdered.  A little of this concentrate, stirred into any meat
flavored preparation, adds both body and savor.  Glace de viande can
rescue a pallid soup, a vapid sauce, or a lackluster gravy, or it can
be a sauce base on its own. The extract is unsalted, for greater
versatility when added to sauces and such so add 1/4 tsp. of salt to
the cup if your drinking the broth.

Makes 2 cups (reconstituted, about 8 quarts, or 1 cup of broth per
Tbsp. of essence.

6 pounds (or more) beef and veal bones, sawed into pieces by the
butcher (try to have the pieces cut no more than 2 to 3 inches long
or wide.) 3-1/2 to 4 pounds boneless shin of beef, cut into 1 inch
cubes 2 large, unpeeled onions, one sliced, the other left whole 2
large carrots, scrubbed and cut up coarsely Water as needed 2 ribs of
celery, with leaves, cut up 1/2 tsp. dried thyme, crumbled 1 medium
bay leaf 1 whole clove 2 ripe tomatoes, coarsely chunked 1 unpeeled
clove garlic, left whole 2 or 3 sprigs parsley

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  In one or two large, shallow
roasting pans spread all the bones and half of the shin beef,
reserving the other half in the refrigerator.  Add the sliced onion
and the cut up carrots. Put the pan or pans into the oven and brown
the ingredients for 40 to 50 minutes, stirring and turning them from
time to time; you want a good brown color.

Pour off any fat and put the bones, meat, and vegetables into a very
large stock pot.  Pour 2 or 3 cups of water into the roasting pan(s),
then set over direct heat and stir and scrape to dissolve all the
brown bits.  Pour the deglazing liquid into the stock pot.  Add
enough water to cover everything by about 2 inches.  Add the celery,
thyme, bay leaf, the second onion (stuck with a single clove,
tomatoes, garlic, and parsley.

Bring the liquid to a boil, then adjust the heat so that the pot,
partially covered, maintain a gentle simmer, with only an occasional
bubble. Skim off any foam at the beginning and cook everything for 7
or 8 hours, skimming occasionally (this is to achieve clarity in the
finished essence). The simmering can be interrupted for several
hours, or overnight; let the pot sit, uncovered, for up to 8 hours at
room temperature, then resume cooking when convenient. (Refrigerate
for longer times or if the weather is warm.)

After you judge all possible flavor has been extracted from the
solids in the pot, strain them all out, pressing on them with a spoon
to extract all the juices.  Skim all fat from the strained broth,
which by now will amount to about 4 or 5 quarts.  Strain the broth
through a cheesecloth-lined strainer into the washed out pot (or into
a smaller one) and add the remaining beef, which you have meanwhile
chopped or ground to the fineness of hamburger.

Resume simmering, skimming off fat and scum about every half hour.
After cooking the stock with the beef for 1-1/2 hours, strain out the
meat, pressing it to extract all possible flavor. Strain the broth
through the cheesecloth again a begin the final reduction.  Resume
simmering the stock, cooking the ever-strengthening essence gently as
long as necessary for it to become a syrupy substance that will coat
a cool metal spoon; this may take up to 2 hours.  (For the clearest
essence, skim frequently. However, the flavor of the finished product
will be fine if you aren't too fussy about the skimming; just be sure
to skim off any fat that appears.

The essence is finished when it passes the metal-spoon test.  Strain
it through a fine meshed metal strainer into small jars or pots and
let it cool, uncovered.  Cover it closely and store in the
refrigerator, or freeze it.  If frozen, scoop out with a hot spoon as
needed.

Note:  The exact yield will depend on how much collagen was contained
in the bones and meat--the more collagen, the sooner the jellying
stage is reached. The cooled essence will be firm, almost rubbery,
and highly concentrated in flavor.  If any surface mold should
eventually develop, remove it--it's harmless.

Beef Soup With Grated Horseradish

soups

      ----INGREDIENTS----
4 quart water
1  beef roast - 2 pounds
2 large onions
1  horseradish root
1  salt to taste
1  crusty french bread
      ----DIRECTIONS----

Brown roast in large heavy stock pot. Brown chopped onion after the
roast. Cover roast and onions with 4 quarts of water. Boil until
roast is tender. Take off heat and cool long enough so that you can
shred the meat by hand.

Return the shredded meat to the stock pot and season soup to taste.
Slice bread on diagonal and float on stock. Take cleaned fresh
horseradish and grate it into the soup. Taste occasionally until you
have got it as you want it (at least 1/4 C of grated horseradish).

Stand back while you are grating soup into boiling stock. The fumes
will make your eyes burn and water and your sinuses will instantly
clear.

Beef Soup With Lemon Grass ( Canh Thit Xao Sa )

soups

1  stalk fresh lemon grass or
1 tablespoon dried lemon grass
1  sprinkling of freshly ground black; pepper
2 teaspoon fish sauce (nuoc mam)
1  clove garlic, chopped
6 oz fatty beef chuck, sliced paper thin
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2  shallots or white part of 2 scallio; ns, sliced
3 cup water
1 1/2  beef bouillon cubes
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon fresh coriander (chinese parsley),; chopped
2  scallions, green part only, chopped

Here's a pretty simple Vietnamese beef soup recipe in contrast to the
recipe for Hanoi Beef Soup.  It doesn't call for hot chilies, but you
can slice a couple into thin rounds and toss 'em in.  That's kosher
(if that term can apply...) with any Vietnamese soup.  Add 'em either
when the soup is brought to it's final boil or just after it's
removed from the heat.

If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and
upper two-thirds of the stalk, then chop.  If you are using dried, it
must be soaked for 2 hours, then drained and chopped fine.

Sprinkle the black pepper, 1 teaspoon of the fish sauce, and chopped
garlic over the meat; mix well and allow the meat to absorb the
flavors for a few minutes.

Heat the oil and fry the shallots over a high flame.  Add the lemon
grass and fry for about 1 minute, then add the meat.  Cook until all
traces of redness are gone.  Add the water, bring to a boil, and add
the beef bouillon cubes, remaining 1 teaspoon fish sauce, and salt.
Immediately before serving, bring the soup to a boil.  Pour into
bowls and sprinkle with the chopped coriander and scallion.

Beef Stew With Cumin Seed

main dish, meats, stews, vegetables

2 cup unbleached, all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon salt; plus extra to taste
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper - plus; extra to taste
3 lb beef stew meat; in 1 cubes
1/4 cup olive oil
1 cup dry red wine
1 1/2 cup homemade beef stock
1 cup canned crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoon ground cuminseed
1 teaspoon chili powder
1  bay leaf
8  to 12 white pearl onions
6  garlic cloves - peeled and chopped
1/2 cup chopped italian parsley - plus extr; a for garnish
1 1/2 cup green sicilian olives

Stir the flour, thyme, 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper together in a
shallow bowl.  Turn the cubes of stew meat in the flour to coat well,
shake off excess and transfer to a plate.

Heat olive oil in a heavy kettle.  Add the beef cubes, a few at a
time, and brown them well on all sides.  As they are browned,
transfer them to paper towels to drain.

When all the meat is browned, discard excess oil but do not wash the
kettle.  Add the wine, beef stock and crushed tomatoes; set kettle
over medium heat.  Bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up the
browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Return beef to the kettle,
then add cuminseed, chili powder and bay leaf and season to taste
with salt and pepper.

Cover kettle and set it on the middle rack of the oven. Bake at 350
F. for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally and regulating the oven
temperature to maintain the stew at a steady simmer.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Cut an "x" in the
root end of each pearl onion and drop them into the boiling water for
1 minute. Drain them and drop them into a bowl of cold water. When
completely cool, drain and peel them.

After the stew has been in the oven about 1 hour, stir in the onions.
Continue to cook the stew, uncovered.

After another 15 minutes, stir in the garlic, 1/2 cup parsley and the
olives.  Continue to cook, uncovered, until stew is reduced and
thickened to your liking and beef is tender. Transfer to a serving
bowl, sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately.

The authors note that "depending on the rest of the menu, this stew
seems Mexican or Mediterranean because it is hearty and intriguingly
seasoned with cuminseed..."

BEEF STEW~ PRESSURE COOKED

beef, soup/stew

1 tablespoon shortening
1 lb 1-in cubed stew beef
1 large onion; sliced
1/2 cup water
4 small peeled potatoes
1 pkg frozen peas
1 small carrot; chunked
1 can (15 oz) stewed tomatoes
1 1/2 teaspoon my seasoning (follows)

A VERY QUICK AND EASY STEW RECIPE

Heat the cooker.  Add shortening. Brown the meat.  Add the vegetables,
stewed tomatoes, and water, and place over the meat.

Close the cover securely.  Place pressure regulator on vent pipe and
cook 10-12 minutes with pressure regulator rocking slowly. Cool
cooker at once. If desired, make a paste of 1 tablespoon flour and
1/4 cup of water and stir into stew to thicken.

Another method of preparing stew is to cook the meat separately 8-10
minutes, then add the vegetables and cook 5 more minutes with the
presure regulator rocking slowly.

My Seasoning: 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part
black pepper. Mix well before measuring and adding to the recipe.

Beef-Noodle Stew

beef, chinese, crockpot, soup/stew

      ----WOMAN'S DAY; 2/1/94----
      ----BASIC STEW----
1 1/2 lb boneless beef chuck
1 cup stock
3/4 cup onions, chopped
1/2 tablespoon garlic cloves, crushed
      ----THIS VARIATION----
3 cup beef stock
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup oyster sauce; or black bean
16 oz mixed vegetables; not thawed
8 oz capellini; thin spaghetti
1 slice green onions; for garnish

You may substitute lamb or pork shoulder for the beef. Use beef stock
for beef, chicken stock for pork or lamb.

Basic stew: Trim meat of fat and cut into 1-1/2" chunks. Bring all
ingredients to boil in 4-qt pot, cover tightly, reduce heat, and
simmer 2-1/2 hours, until meat is tender. Crockpot directions: pile
all ingredients into crockpot and cook all day on LOW. When done:
skim off and discard fat.

It takes less than 8 minutes to assemble this stew. Then you can pay
it little or no attention as it simmers for about 2-1/2 hours. Make
multiples of the basic stew, then divide stew into 4-serving
portions; refrigerate or in airtight containers for up to 5 days, or
freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in microwave-safe container on
defrost or in refrigerator for 24 hours.

To assemble: heat basic stew, stock, water, and oyster sauce in 4-qt
pot over medium heat until boiling gently. Stir in vegetables. Coo9k
5 minutes, until thawed and hot. Add pasta and, stirring almost
constantly, cook 3 minutes, until pasta is firm but tender and stock
is thickened.

Lamb and pork would be good here, too.  Oyster sauce and black bean
sauce are available in the Asian-food section of your market. Keep in
mind that noodles will continue to absorb liquid, so this stew should
be served immediately.  If you're not sure how soon it will be eaten,
cook noodles separately, thicken stock with 2 tb cornstarch stirred
into 1/2 c cold water, and then add cooked noodles just before
serving.

Bennigan's Potato Soup

1 garnett pjxg05a
1 3/4 oz ham base -- (2-#40 scoop)
2 quart chicken stock
8 oz yellow onion -- dice
3 oz margarine
2 lb potatoes -- bite size
1 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 cup milk
3 oz flour
3 oz margarine

Combine chicken stock in sauce pan with ham base. Stir until lumps are
gone. In separate stock pot: melt first margarine measurement; add
onion and sautee until transparent. Addpotato bite size pieces and
pepper. Add chicken stock mix and stir until well mixed. Bring
mixture to a boil. In small pan, melt second margarine measure and
add flour to create a roux. It should be light brown in color. When
stock comes to a boil, add roux with a wire whisk. This will cause
the soup to start thickening. Return to a boil. Slowly add the milk.
If the soup is too thin, make additional roux and add it to the soup.
If you need to do this, be sure to cook the roux until a tan color.
This will get rid of the raw flour taste. If the soup is too thick,
thin it out with more milk.

Bigos (Sauerkraut Stew)

stews

4  mushroom, dried
1/4 cup ; water
2 lb sauerkraut
1 large apple; peeled/cored/sliced
20 oz tomato; canned
5  peppercorn
1 bay leaf
1 lb polish sausage; diced
1 lb stewing beef
1 cup bacon; coarsely chopped

Soak the mushrooms in 1/4 cup water for 2 hours. Bring to boil and
simmer for 1/2 hour. Slice.

Wash the sauerkraut and sqeeze it. Add mushrooms and the liquid in
which they were cooked. Add the apples, the tomatoes, peppercorns and
bay leaf. Cover and simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Add the meat
and the bacon. Simmer 1 hour longer.

My method differs a little bit. I rinse the sauerkraut and simmer it
for about a 1/2 hour. In a separate pot I simmer the stewing beef for
the same amount of time with whatever spices happen to fall into my
hands at the time, including the peppercorns and the bay leaf.
Meanwhile, in a large fry pan I fry the bacon, a large diced onion,
the Polish sausage and the mushrooms. Then I drain the sauerkraut and
mix it into the beef. Into that I mix in the bacon mixture. Then I
simmer all that for about another hour.

This dish tastes best reheated the next day. Serve with steamed
potatoes or rye bread. Excellent for banquets and buffet
entertaining. It also freezes well.

1/2    onion
2    ham hocks
:          salt
1/8 ts black pepper

processor.) Drain beans. Add vegetables, 5 cups water,
ham hocks or ham bone, and pepper to taste. Add salt
if you wish. Bring to a simmer and cook over low heat
for 3 hours or until beans are tender. 3. Remove ham
hocks and set aside to cool. Remove meat from bones
and cut meat into half-inch pieces. 4. Put 2 cups of
the soup into a blender along with the margarine and
flour; puree. Pour this puree back in pan. Puree more
of the soup if you prefer a smoother texture. Add the
chopped ham pieces back into the soup. Simmer for
15-20 minutes until soup is slightly thickened.

Yield: 6-8 large servings. This soup is especially
good when sprinkled with a few drops of hot pepper
sauce just before serving.

Black Bean & Smoked Chicken Soup-Daley

chicken, soups

1/2 cup dried black beans
2 cup water
1 bay leaf
1 light vegetable oil cooking
1  spray
1/2 cup broccoli -- peel &
1  dice-stems
1/2 cup carrot -- cubed
1 (1 medium carrot)
1 cup celery -- cubed
1 (2 med stalks)
1 cup chopped onion -- (1 medium)
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1 tablespoon dried basil
1/2 cup dry white wine
8 oz chicken breasts without
1  skin
4 tablespoon barbecue sauce -- (no oil
1  type)
1 cup chicken stock -- fat
1  skimmed
12 oz evaporated skim milk
2 cup broccoli flowerets
1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 tb
1 cold water
1 tablespoon liquid smoke
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon tabasco sauce
1/4 cup fresh cilantro -- chopped

Pick over and rinse the beans. Put them into a large bowl and cover
completely with cold water.  Let the beans soak overnight (or for at
least 8 hours).

Drain the beans and transfer them to a medium saucepan. Add the 2 cups
water and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook for
15 minutes. Reduce the heat to lowand simmer, uncovered, for about
20    minutes, until the beans are tender. Drain the beans and
discard the bay leaf.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place a heavy stockpot over medium heat for about 1 minute, then
spray it twice with the vegetable oil. Add the broccoli stems,
carrot, celery, and onion. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook
for 5 minutes, stirring once or twice.  Stir in the thyme, basil, and
wine. Simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, until the wine has
been reduced by half.

In the meantime, coat the chicken thoroughly with the barbecue sauce
and bake for 10 minutes on the top shelf of the oven. Remove the
chicken from the oven and allow it to cool just long enough to
handle. Cut the chicken into small cubes.

Add the chicken, chicken stock, and beans to the stockpot. Cook over
low heat for about 3 minutes, until thoroughly heated. Stir in the
evaporated milk and the broccoli florets. Cook for 5 minutes,
stirring if needed to keep the soup from coming to a boil. Add the
dissolved cornstarch and cook for 2 minutes more, stirring
constantly. Stir in the liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, and
Tabasco sauce.

Garnish with chopped cilantro.

Black Eyed Pea Soup With Arkansalsa & Creme Fraiche

soups

1  pam cooking spray
1 lb black-eyed peas
2 quart vegetable stock or water
2  bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon oregano, dried
1/2 teaspoon basil, dried
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon summer savory, dried
1 teaspoon cracked coriander seeds
1  fresh black pepper to taste
2 tablespoon tomato paste
1 cup additional vegetable stock
1 cup spicy hot v8
1 tablespoon pickapeppa or worcestershire
1 teaspoon tamari/shoyu soy sauce
1 teaspoon tabasco sauce
2  salt-free morga vegetarian
1  bouillon cubes *
3  cloves of garlic, peeled
1  & put through a press
1 1/2 tablespoon mild vegetable oil, such as
1  corn or peanut
1 large onion, chopped
2 medium carrots, scrubbed or peeled,
1  and finely diced
1 large green pepper, steemed,
1  seeded, and diced
2  ribs celery with leaves,
1  finely diced
1  salt and fresh pepper /taste
1  garlic oil *
1  arkansalsa (see recipe)
1  creme fraiche, sour cream,
1  kefir cheese, or plain
1  yogurt for garnish

1. Spray a large heavy pot with the Pam,  and in it soak the beans in
the stock or water to cover overnight.

2. The next day, add enough of the remaining stock or water to cover
the beans by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to
very low, and add the bay leaves, oregano, basil, cumin seeds,
savory, coriander seeds, and several generous grinds of black pepper.
Cover the beans and let them simmer, stirring occasionally, until
thoroughly soft and cooked -- until you can easily squash a bean
against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon.  Taste one -- it
will be extremely, creamily soft, though very  bland at this point.
Don't worry, things are about to get much more interesting in
Black-Eyed Pea land.  Keep the soup over low heat.

3. Dissolve the tomato paste in the additional cup of stock or water,
and add it to the simmering black-eyes with the V8, Pick apeppa or
Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, Tabasco sauce, Morga cubes, and
garlic. Give the mixture a good stir to combine.

4.  Spray a 10-inch skillet with Pam, and in it heat the oil over
medium heat.  Add the onion and saute until transparent, about 4
minutes.  Add the carrots, green pepper, and celery, and continue
sauteing until they soften a bit, another 2 minutes.  Stir these
vegetables into the simmering soup, scraping the skillet to get out
any little flavorful bits.  At this point the soup will be on the
thick and stewlike side; if you want it soupier, add addiitional
stock.  Now taste.  Turn up the volume by adding salt and pepper and
maybe a little good old garlic oil.  Its flavor will really come
alive at this point, but only begin to dance truly after another 15
minutes or so of uncovered simmering.

5. Ladle the hot soup into bowls, and top each serving with
Arkansalsa, a dab of creme fraiche or any of the other dairy choices,
and a sprig of cilantro.  pass additional salsa and creme fraiche, or
other dairy dabs, at the table.

* MORGA: This is my one major concession to convenience foods -- Morga
Vegetable Bouillon Cubes, the salt-free variety.  Purchase them at a
natural foods store.  They are Swiss-made, and good.  Always keep
some on hand, but dont rely on them too often, or your soups will
become monotonous.

* Araknsalsa: See recipe

* GARLIC OIL: If you make one garlic preparation, it should be this.
We always have a couple of cups of this in the fridge at the
reastaurant, and during busy times of the year go through several
quarts a week.  It is so handy, and vvirtually a secret weapon in
seasoning.  We brush fish with Garlic Oil before baking them; we stir
it into soups at the last minute; we add it to meat and chicken
marinades; to sauces and vinaigrettes; to everthing you might imagine
and more.  Once you get the garlic cloves peeled, this is a breeze to
prepare, provided you have a food processor. See recipe for Garlic Oil

Blackeyed Peas & Rice

low fat, rice, stews, vegetarian

1/2  onion
1 single lipton rice 'n' sauce cajun
1 tablespoon pepper
1 single stew meat
1 teaspoon creole or cajun seasoning
1 single bell pepper

Cayenne pepper or hot sauce

Look thru peas for rocks and wash through 3 waters. Soak peas in water
overnight in fridge.  The next day, throw out water they soaked in;
some claim this keeps beans from giving you a problem, but stay on
this diet a couple weeks and you won't have a problem anyway. It goes
away. Wash stew meat and put stew meat and pre-soaked peas in big pot
on stove and bring to boil, with PLENTY of water. Add seasonings to
taste. If you use Cajun seasoning it contains salt; so don't add
extra salt!!!! Otherwise, add salt to taste.  When stew meat and peas
come to a boil, reduce to Medium and keep watching to add water so
they don't scorch. After about 40 minutes add packet of Rice and
Sauce, preferably Cajun flavor. Start watching the water really
carefully now, and add a pint from time to time. After about 20
minutes of rice cooking, add bell pepper, onion, and more seasonings
if you need.  (This dish is good hot and peppery) Everything should
be ready at the same time. When test bite shows all is ready, eat!

1 1/2 lb shrimp (20ct), save shells
1 pint oysters, small, save juice
1 lb scallops
2  chicken breasts, boned
1 lb andouille or smoked sausage
1 teaspoon tabasco sauce
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
6  cloves garlic, minced
8 oz butter (two sticks)
8 oz flour (one cup)
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1  bottle doxee's clam juice
2 cup uncooked parboilled rice  use uncle; ben's converted
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
2  bay leaves
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  a little msg
4 cup chicken stock (about)
1  fry pan or deep pot, iron

This is an authentic family recipe that my mother taught me in 1950
in New Orleans.  It makes a great dinner party main dish.  Like
chinese food, it is long on chopping and assembling, but goes
together and cooks rather quickly.

Shrimp - First peel shrimp, keep chilled, save shells.  Put shells in
small pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer
for 15 minutes.  When water has been reduced by about half, remove
from heat, cool, and strain out shells.  Reserve water.

Chicken and sausage - Chop sausage and chicken into medium bite-sized
pieces, brown in fry pan, drain, set aside.

Okra - Cut off stems and tips, slice into 1/2" pieces.  Set aside.

Prepare garlic, Spanish onions, green onions, celery, set aside
separately.

Roux - Melt butter in a large IRON pan or deep pot, add flour.  Stir
constantly over low heat until flour is cooked, starting to lightly
brown. Care is needed here because from cooked to burned is a short
but tragic step, but you can start over.  After light brown, the
color is all politics, it tastes good.

Once the roux is cooked, stir in garlic and celery.  Turn up heat a
bit, say about medium, but stir constantially to prevent roux from
burning. After about 1-2 minutes, dump in chopped Spanish onions and
green pepper, continue stirring.  After another minute or so of
cooking and stiring, dump in the okra.  By this time the roux appears
to have disappeared, but is still there, clinging to the vegetables.
Continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes till the okra starts to wilt
and become shiny. (If you are using an iron fry pan, rather than a
pot, you will now be running out of space and will need to now
transfer the ingredients to a larger pot to continue.)

Stir in the chicken and sausage pieces.  After another minute, mix in
shrimp water, the oyster juice, the bottle of Doxee's Clam Juice
(THIS IS THE SECRET TO THE NOLA FLAVOR!), and enough chicken stock to
cover the ingredients by an inch or so.  Add bay leaves, Tabasco and
Worcestershire sauces, spices, salt and pepper.  Slowly bring to a
boil (over a period of five minutes or more), stirring frequently. As
soon as the mixture boils, immediately remove from heat and cover.

After five minutes, remove cover, add tomato, oysters, scallops and
shrimp. Give a few more stirs, re-cover, and wait for 20 minutes. The
declining heat from the mixture will cook, but not overcook, the
seafood. From this point, this mixture should never be brought to the
boil again. Now is a good time to make the rice.

Check for thickness.  If too thick, thin out with additional chicken
stock. If too thin, add file' in a separate serving bowl before
adding to rice. Once file' is added to gumbo, do not re-heat, as this
will cause stringiness.  Just before serving, mix in the chopped
green onions. They should be only slightly cooked, a little wilted
but also a little crunchy.

Serve in soup platter, with an island of white rice surrounded by a
green moat of gumbo, meat and seafood.  Serve with split buttered and
broiled French bread, and white wine or beer.

This is an expensive dish to fix, and there should be no left-overs.
If there are, then use up promptly, because of the seafood content.

Bojti Halikraleves (Spawn Soup For Lent)

fish, hungarian, soup/stew

2 each carrots
2 each parsnips
2 medium onions
1 small celery knob
1 teaspoon salt
2 each bay leaves
5 each peppercorns, black
1 tablespoon butter, unsalted
1 tablespoon flour, all-purpose
1 pinch paprika
1/2 lb fish fillet; small pieces
1 each fish head
1 lb spawn (fish roe)
2 tablespoon vinegar, wine, white
1/4 cup sour cream

Peel vegetables and cut into small pieces, and together with salt,
bay leaves and peppercorns cook them in 2 qts water till they are
almost soft.
Make a roux with butter and flour, cook for only a few minutes,
leaving it very light. Add paprika and whip 1/2 cup cold water into
the roux.
Pour roux into the vegetable mixture and bring again to a boil.
Reduce heat to a simmer.
Add fish pieces and fish head, and simmer soup for 10 minutes. Add
spawn and cook for another 5 minutes.
Pour in the vinegar; just before serving stir in the sour cream.
Adjust salt and vinegar to your taste.
Note: During Lent most Hungarians eat a lot of fish. There are
almost always little bits of fish meat, bones and heads left over and
that's when this soup would be a good beginning for a Lenten meal.

about an hour, put in garlic and sugar. I have used Sweet and Low.

BOUILLABAISSE~ PART 2 OF 2

soups

1 see part 1

: Continued from Part 1

NOTES:

*  Marseille-style fish soup -- A friend and I had been talking about
the glories of bouillabaisse for the past year and we finally decided
to use New Year's Eve as an excuse to fish rather than continuing to
cut bait, ad nauseam.  The following recipes are a combination of
several derived from old issues of _Gourmet_, Julia Child, the
"Playboy Gourmet Cookbook," and "gee, that sounds good, let's add it."

*  The accompanying Rouille is a garlic-hot pepper mayonnaise
condiment traditional to Marseille-style fish soup. Rouille is
traditionally made with a mortar and pestle but I prefer to use a
food processor, it's just too much work otherwise. Pass the rouille
as a condiment. Usually about 1 T per serving is sufficient, this
stuff is the essence of garlic and hot pepper.

*  If you can't get fish trimmings for the court bouillon, add
bottled clam juice and shrimp and lobster shells.

*  To be truly authentic, our bouillabaisse should have included eel,
but my friend was a bit squeamish about that so we left it out.
Basically, any combination of shellfish and firm-fleshed fish can be
used with the more variety the better.  I dislike using crab since it
flakes so easily and is lost in the broth. If you can't get live
lobsters, substitute frozen lobster tails but be careful not to
overcook.

*  Use saffron threads, rather than saffron powder which tends to be
adulterated with safflower and not the same thing at all. Be
conservative with the saffron, a little goes a long way and can give
the dish a medicinal taste.

*  We preceded our dinner with herbed leek and prosciutto tartlets
served with champagne. Dinner included bouillabaisse; a
hearts-of-palm salad with pimento and greek olives and vinaigrette
dressing; lots of crusty french bread to soak up the broth; a dry
white wine (Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc '84); and my friend's mother's
sponge cake with whipped cream icing, fresh raspberries and raspberry
sauce, accompanied by Asti Spumante.

Braised Lion's Head In A Sandy Pot

chinese, meats, soup/stew

1 lb pork butt, ground or chopped
1/4 cup water chestnuts, minced
1 teaspoon ginger root, minced
2 green onions, minced
1/2 cup cooked rice, minced
1 tablespoon dark soy
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
2 tablespoon water
3 cup chinese mustard cabbage,
1  shredded
4 cup stock (or water)
1/2 teaspoon salt, to taste
1/4 teaspoon sugar
6 tablespoon peanut oil

Preparation:  In bowl, thoroughly mix pork, water chestnuts, ginger
root, green onions, cooked rice, dark soy, sesame oil & water. Allow
mixture to marry for 30 minutes. Form into firm balls, one for each
serving, each the size of a tennis ball (about 3 1/2" across).

Braising:  Heat wok or skillet to hot; add oil.  When oil begins to
smoke, introduce meatballs 1 at a time, so as not to cool oil. Fry
meatballs until a brown crust has formed. They must be well crusted
in order to retain their shape while stewing.

Cooking in Sandy Pot:  Line sandy pot with shredded Chinese mustard
cabbage; sprinkle with pan oil from meatballs, salt & sugar. Add
meatballs, then add cool or cold stock. Bring slowly to boil; cover;
reduce heat to medium & simmer for about 2 hours. Correct seasoning
if necessary. Serve.

Brenda's Black Bean Soup

soups

3 cup dried black beans
2  ham hocks
1  bell pepper (chopped)
1 small onion (chopped)
1  whole sour orange or tangerine
1 tablespoon vinegar (if you used a sweet orange; or tangerine)
1  stick oleo
2 tablespoon of flour
1  salt and pepper to taste

Tried out the "White Trash Cookbook" last night and whipped up this
black bean soup.  In spite of the fact that I forgot to finish it
with the browned flour and butter, it turned out pretty darn good, if
a tad bland. (I did cheat and use real butter instead of oleo.)
Here's the recipe. Never having had black bean soup before, let alone
making it, I'm not sure what would be kosher to liven it up a bit.
Anyone have any tips? I served it with cornbread and a plate of
sliced homegrown tomatoes. BTW, the recipe is transcribed exactly as
it appears in the book to give a taste of Mickler's writing style.
Pretty neat stuff, though I'm not sure if I'm ready for the cold
collard sandwich yet...

Put your beans in a soup pot and cover with water.  Boil, take off
the fire and let sit til cool.  Cook onions and bell peppers in 1/2
the oleo until limp.  Add them and the ham hocks and orange to the
cooled beans; cover charitably with water.  Simmer until beans is
soft (1 to 2 hours). Fish out the orange right now, before it gets
tore up.  With the rest of the oleo, brown the flour in a black
frying pan, then stir it into the beans. Brenda says:  "Make sure you
got a soup, now.  If you need to add some more water, do it."

Brunswick Stew I

chicken, colonial, stews

6 lb stewing hen
1  (or two 3 lb broilers)
2 large onions, sliced
2 cup okra, cut (optional)
4 cup fresh or
1  2(l lb cans tomatoes)
2 cup lima beans, frozen
3 medium potatoes, diced
4 cup corn cut from cob or
1  2 (cans of corn, 1 lb each)
3 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon sugar

Cut chicken in pieces and simmer in 3 quarts of water for a THIN
stew, or 2 quarts of water for a THICK stew, until meat can easily be
removed from the bones, about 2 1/4 hours.  Remove chicken and let
cool.

Add the vegetables to the broth and simmer uncovered until the beans
and potatoes are tender.  Stir occasionally to prevent scorching.
Add the chicken deboned and diced, or in sections.  Add the
seasonings.

NOTE:  If canned vegetables are used, include their juices and reduce
water to 2 quarts for a thin stew, and 1 quart for a thick stew.

ALSO NOTE:  Brunswick Stew is one of those delectable things that
benefit from long, slow cooking.   It is a rule in some homes never
to eat Brunswick Stew the same day it is made, because its flavor
improves if it is left to stand overnight and is reheated the next
day.

Butternut Squash Soup With Leeks

appetizers, soups, vegetarian

1 large butternut squash
2 teaspoon olive oil
3 medium leeks
6 cup vegetable stock
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1 tablespoon salt (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1  croutons to taste

Preheat oven to 425F.

Cut squash in half lengthwise and remove seeds and membrane. Place
halves (cut-side down) on an oiled baking sheet and bake for 25 to 35
minutes, until tender. Remove peel from squash when cool enough to
handle. Mash or chop squash into chunks.

Meanwhile, cut off most of the green leaves from leeks (reserve for
another use if desired).  Slice leeks in half lengthwise and rinse
well to remove all traces of dirt. Cut into 1/4 inch thick slices.
Heat olive oil in Dutch oven or soup pot and add leeks.  Cover and
cook over medium low heat for 10-15 minutes, until leeks are just
barely soft. Stir in the squash, stock, thyme, salt and pepper, and
bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer soup about 20
minutes. Serve soup topped with croutons.

1  lg onion
2  celery; stalks cut in 3rds
3 lb bone; meat/marrow bones
2  lemon; (fresh,to taste (froz
2 can tomatoes; do not drain (larg

This is a hearty sweet and sour meat soup that can be used as a main
dish. Bubbies  measurements were never exact. You need to taste. Put
meat and bones in a 8 or 12 qt stock pot. Put in cans of tomato,
cover with water and bring to a boil. In the meantime, get your
veggies ready. Slice beets and carrots, others go in whole. When
stock boils, skim off top. Put in beets, carrots, garlic, and other
veggies. Turn heat down to a simmer and keep lid on askew. After
about an hour, put in garlic and sugar.
I have used Sweet and Low. Amounts are a matter of preference. It
should have a rich, sweet and sour taste. I break up the meat and
stir it back into the soup before serving. NOTE: Sometimes I add some
tomato paste; 2 or 3 T for body; Enjoy!!! * Elaine/Framingham *

Cajun Jambalaya

vegetables

1/2 cup bacon drippings
1  or margarine
1 lb smoked sausage - diced
1/2 lb andouille - diced
1  (polish can be substituted)
1/2 lb tasso
1/2 lb bacon - crumbled
      Chicken - julienned ---- OR -----
2 cup julienned turkey
2 large onions - coarsely chopped
1 medium bell pepper - chopped
6  ribs celery - coarsely chopp
4  clove garlic - finely minced
3 cup rice - long grain
16 oz rotel tomatoes and hot
1  peppers
2 cup beef stock
2 teaspoon kitchen bouquet
1/2 teaspoon thyme
2 teaspoon chili powder
1  black pepper to taste
1  cayenne pepper to taste
1  salt to taste
2 lb shrimp - peeled
12  green onions - sliced
1/2 cup parsley - minced

To make a really good pot of jambalaya, you're going to need a
well-seasoned black cast iron Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid.
And for this recipe, an 8-quart pot is perfect!

So take the pot, put it on the burner over high heat, and pour in the
bacon drippings (or margarine).  Then toss in the smoked sausage,
andouille, tasso, and crumbled bacon and stir-fry the meats until the
smoked sausage turns light brown (it should take about 8 minutes or
so).

Now, drop in the julienned chicken and stir-fry it until every strip
loses its translucency (turns white).  Then immediately add the
onions, bell pepper, celery and garlic, and reduce the heat to
medium-high, and cook the vegetables until they soften.

At this point, pour in the rice.  And you want to stir it thoroughly
into the seasoning vegetables and meats until every single grain is
moistened -- about 4 to 5 minutes.

Next, add the tomatoes, beef stock, Kitchen Bouquet, thyme and chili
powder, blend everything together well, and bring the mixture to a
slow boil.  When this happens, taste the liquids and season the dish
to taste with salt, black and cayenne pepper.  Just remember that
you're going to have to season it a little on the "heavy side"
because the rice will absorb much of the seasonings as it cooks, and
you still have a couple pounds of shrimp to mix in.  *So be sure to
taste carefully!* [I'd definitely add Tabasco for flavor, too.]

When everything is just right, reduce the heat as low as it will go,
put the lid on the pot, and simmer the jambalaya for about an hour.
This "slow cooking" process allows each grain of rice to cook evenly,
puff properly, and pick up the combination of flavors.  If the heat
is too high, the rice will stick to the bottom of the pot and turn
mushy.

Then when the jambalaya is done, about 5 minutes before you're ready
to eat, stir in the raw shrimp, green onions, and parsley, put the
lid back on the pot, and continue to simmer the jambalaya over *low
heat* until the shrimp turn pink.

I suggest that before you serve the dish, you fluff the rice
slightly. I also suggest that you serve the dish alongside crispy
butter French bread and ice-cold beer.

CHEF'S HINTS: 1. Under no circumstances should you remove the cover
from the pot during the slow-cooking process. If you do, you'll
release steam you need to cook the rice. Your rice will turn out hard
in the center and your jambalaya will be dry instead of moist.  Don't
peek in the pot! 2. If you don't feel that your stove-top will cook
the jambalaya slowly enough, put the cover on the pot (after you mix
the liquids in), set your oven at 300F, put the pot into the oven,
and bake the dish for about 45 minutes.

Calabrian Asparagus Soup

soups, vegetarian

2  clove garlic - minced
2 tablespoon olive oil - extra-virgin
2 lb asparagus - trimmed and cut into 1-; inch pieces
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
4 cup vegetable broth - (see recipe) or c; anned low-
1  sodium chicken broth
4  eggs
1/2 cup parmesan - fresly grated or pecorin; o, plus extra
1  for serving
6 slice italian bread - toasted

Number of Servings:   6

1.  In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over
moderate heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes.
Add the asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes. Add
the salt, pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the
heat to moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender,
about 15 minutes.

2.  In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce
the heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very
slowly ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs,
whisking constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg
mixture into the soup in the saucepan.  Increase the heat to
moderately low and cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just
thickens, about 8 minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs
will curdle. Remove from the heat.

3.  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the
hot soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.

Serves 6.

NOTE:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian
cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from
day-old or slightly stale bread. Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.

2  scallions, white part only, crushed; with the side of a knife
1  freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon plus 4 teaspoons fish sauce (nuoc m; am)

1/2 cup canned sliced sour bamboo
1/4  fresh pineapple, cut in a lengthwis; e section and sliced
1 dash msg (optional)
2 tablespoon mixed chopped fresh coriander (chin; ese parsley)
1  scallion green

An excellent way to get twice the pleasure out of your fish purchase.
You can use either the fish head of the fish carcass if you wish. To
the people of the South, this is as much their traditional dish as
Southern Fried Chicken is to our southerners++and it will meet with
instant praise

Sprinkle the scallions, black pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, and 4
teaspoons fish sauce over the fish head.  Allow to stand for 10 to 15
minutes.

Bring 1 quart of water to a boil and drop in the sour bamboo and
pineapple slices.  Cook at a lively boil for 5 minutes. Drop fish
head into the actively boiling water and, keeping at a boil, add the
2 tablespoons fish sauce, remaining teaspoon salt, and a dash of MSG.
Boil the fish head for a total of 10 minutes. Transfer to a soup
tureen, sprinkle on the coriander and scallion green, and serve.

NOTE:  If the fish head is dropped into water that is not boiling, it
will fall apart.

Makes 4 servings.

Canh Thit Xao Sa (Beef Soup With Lemon Grass)

beef, soups, vietnam

1  stalk fresh lemon grass or
1 tablespoon dried lemon grass
1  sprinkling of freshly ground black; pepper
2 teaspoon fish sauce (nuoc mam)
1  clove garlic, chopped
6 oz fatty beef chuck, sliced paper thin
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2  shallots or white part of 2 scallio; ns, sliced
3 cup water
1 1/2  beef bouillon cubes
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon fresh coriander (chinese parsley),; chopped
2  scallions, green part only, chopped

Here's a pretty simple Vietnamese beef soup recipe in contrast to the
recipe for Hanoi Beef Soup.  It doesn't call for hot chilies, but you
can slice a couple into thin rounds and toss 'em in. That's kosher
(if that term can apply...) with any Vietnamese soup. Add 'em either
when the soup is brought to it's final boil or just after it's
removed from the heat.

If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and
upper two-thirds of the stalk, then chop. If you are using dried, it
must be soaked for 2 hours, then drained and chopped fine.

Sprinkle the black pepper, 1 teaspoon of the fish sauce, and chopped
garlic over the meat; mix well and allow the meat to absorb the
flavors for a few minutes.

Heat the oil and fry the shallots over a high flame. Add the lemon
grass and fry for about 1 minute, then add the meat. Cook until all
traces of redness are gone. Add the water, bring to a boil, and add
the beef bouillon cubes, remaining 1 teaspoon fish sauce, and salt.
Immediately before serving, bring the soup to a boil. Pour into bowls
and sprinkle with the chopped coriander and scallion.

Caramelized Fennel Soup

soups

2 lb fennel bulbs; trim/mince
6 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
4 cup vegetable or chicken broth
1/2 cup whipping cream; opt
1  sea salt; to taste
      ----BOUQUET GARNI----
1  fresh rosemary
1  fresh parsley
1  bay leaf
1  fresh thyme
1  tie together with twine

1. Combine fennel and oil in large, heavy-bottomed stockpot. Stir to
coat fennel with oil. Cook, covered, over low heat 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally. If fennel burns it will give the soup a bitter
taste.

2. Remove lid; continue to cook over low heat. Pieces should gradually
brown and caramelize. Add bouquet garni and broth; simmer; covered, 30
minutes.

3. Discard bouquet garni. Using an immersion blender, roughly puree
soup in stockpot. (Alternatively, pass soup through coarse blade of
food mill or puree coarsely in batches in food processor; and return
to stockpot.) Soup should be creamy but not totally smooth. Stir in
cream, if using; reheat. Taste for seasoning. Serve piping hot in
warmed shallow soup bowls.

NOTE: Fennel has a tough outer skin. It's well worth it to peel it
with a vegetable peeler.

Caribou Goulash

hungarian, stews, game, caribou

2 lb boneless stewing meat
1  marinade:
1 1/4 cup red wine
2 tablespoon olive oil
1  onion; chopped
1 medium carrot; sliced thin
6  black peppercorns
1  bay leaf
1  flour for coating
2 large sweet red bell peppers; cubed
1 medium onion; chopped
2 centiliter garlic; minced
1  rib of celery; sliced
3 tablespoon olive oil
14 oz canned tomatoes
2 tablespoon tomato paste
2 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon caraway seeds (opt'l)
1  salt
1  fresh ground black pepper
1 lb potatoes
1 1/4 cup plain yoghurt or sour cream

In a shallow dish, combine all the marinade ingredients and add the
cubed caribou. Cover and leave in a cool place for 24 hours. Remove
the meat cubes from the marinade. Pat dry and roll in a little flour.
Strain the marinade and reserve.

Cut the peppers in half and remove seeds. Chop the peppers into
cubes. Chop the onion and mince the garlic. Cut the celery into 1/2
inch slices. Heat the oil in a large frying pan, and brown the
caribou quickly. Remove it, then add the chopped vegetables to the
oil and saute quickly; but do not allow to brown.

Put the caribou and fried vegetables into a flameproof casserole. Add
the tomatoes, roughly chopped, and the tomato paste.

Sprinkle the paprika, caraway seeds, and salt and pepper to taste on
to the contents of the casserole, and pour in the marinade liquid.
Stir well and bring almost to boiling. Cover. Turn down the heat and
simmer gently on top of the stove for 1 1/2-2 hours.

25 minutes before the goulash is ready, add the potatoes, peeled and
cubed.

Just before serving, add the yoghurt/sour cream and stir. Taste for
seasoning: more paprika or caraway may be added if liked.

Carl's Sick Soup

pasta, poultry, rice, soups

4 cup water
4 cup chicken broth
3 tablespoon minced green onion
1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1  palmful fresh parsely
1 lb boneless skinless chicken
1  breast -- cut in tiny
1  pieces
6 large carrots -- sliced
1 can unsalted green beans,
1  undrained -- --or--
1 lb fresh green beans
2 cup rice -- --or--
1 lb angel hair pasta

Start this recipe a day in advance by boiling the chicken pieces in
the 4 cups of water with the green onion, black pepper, and parsely.
Put it the refrigerator overnight and the next day scoop the fat off
the top.

The next day, bring 4 cups of water to a boil and add the carrots.
Boil for 10 minutes or so.  Dump in the stock and chicken from the
day before and the green beans and bring back to a boil. The next
part of the cooking takes 20 minutes:

For rice -- Add the rice and cook according to rice directions, about
20 minutes for white rice (I've never used brown rice in this).

For dry angel hair -- dump it in at such a time as the 20 minutes is
up at the same time the angel hair's done to your liking.

For fresh angel hair from the refrigerated section at the grocery --
put it in 3-4 minutes before the 20 minutes is up. Don't overcook the
angel hair!!

I try to get the pasta to be al dente, although sometimes the wine
makes me forget!!  You may want to experiment with spices because
without salt, this recipe can be somewhat bland.

One normal soup ladel full of this soup is somewhere around 300
calories. I forget the actual calorie count of the individual
ingredients, but I averaged them out from the counts given in a book
I have. I do only one ladel. This stuff freezes well and makes great
lunches.

Oh, yes, the wine for this?  I like Bonny Doon '93 or '94 Clos du
Gilroy. It has a peppery flavor that I think goes well with this
light fare. My wife, a white wine fan, likes Chalk Hill Sauvignon
Blanc (I forget the year model) because it too has a peppery flavor.

Carol's Favorite Vegetarian Chili

chili, stews, vegetarian

1 large onion; chopped
3  garlic clove; crushed & pressed
2 tablespoon oil
1  celery rib; diced
1 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup tomato; chopped
2 tablespoon tomato paste
4 cup beans, kidney, black, pinto and/or; garbanzo, cooked
1/2 lb tofu; crumbled (opt)
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon oregano

Saute onion and garlic in oil until onion is soft. Add celery and
spices. Saute another 2-3 minutes. Add tomato and paste. Mash 2 cups
of the beans and add beans and tofu to the pot along with the salt
and oregano. Simmer 30 minutes.

To cook raw beans:

Soak beans in water overnight, OR boil for 2 minutes and let sit,
covered, for 1 hour.  Bring to a boil in same water and simmer about
1 hour or until tender. (beans approximately double in volume, i.e.,
two cups raw = 4 cups cooked)

Notes:  I like cooking my own beans rather than buying canned beans.
:       I use as many different beans as I have at home. Usually at
:       least 3 of the 4 mentioned, and one of the 3 must be black
:       beans because they are my absolute favorite.
:       Add or subtract cayenne pepper for hotness level.
:       A bit more cumin may be good too, I have yet to determine
this,
:       though.

2 large onions; chopped medium small
1  water (as needed)
1/4 cup olive oil
1 1/2 lb zucchini; peeled  (reserve the skin
1 large leek; well washed and   chopped

In a large skillet place the first 1/4 cup of the olive oil and heat
it on medium high until it is hot. Add the carrots and onions, and
saut them for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are clear. Add
enough water to cover the vegetables.  Simmer them for 30 to 40
minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.  Place the vegetables in a
blender and pure them until they are smooth.  Set the pure aside
and let it cool.

In another large skillet place the second 1/4 cup of olive oil and
heat it on medium high until it is hot. Add the peeled zucchini and
leeks, and saut them for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are just
tender. Add enough water to cover the vegetables.  Simmer them for 25
to 30 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed. Place the vegetables
in a blender and pure them until they are smooth. Set the pure
aside and let it cool.

Place the zucchini skins in a pot of boiling water and blanch them
for 3 minutes.  Drain the skins and place them in a blender. Add a
small amount of cold water and pure the skins so that a thick,
smooth consistency is achieved (the same consistency as the other 2
pures). Set the pure aside and let it cool.

Refrigerate the 3 soups until they are cold.

In each of 8 individual serving bowls place a portion of the 3 soups.
Swirl them together with a knife to form a design.

Carrot Soup With Plums

soups, vegetables

1 lb small carrots
1  to 2 small turnips
6  cups, good homemade chicken stock
1 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoon dijon mustard
2  to 4 tbsp chopped parsley
1  to 2 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon
2  to 3 tbsp butter
6  to 8 pitted plums

Rind and juice of 2 oranges Salt and pepper

Grate the rind from the oranges.  Squeeze 1/4 cup fresh orange juice.
Clean the carrots and trim the stems. If the carrots are small, cook
whole; if they are larger, cut into any shape so they will cook in
about 10 minutes. Peel the turnips and cut into 1/2 inch pieces. In a
saucepan, cook the vegetables in the orange juice on slow heat until
tender. Add the chicken stock and let the vegetables steep on a slow
flame for another 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove to a blender and puree
until smooth; correct the seasonings.  Make a compound butter by
combining the orange rind, honey, mustard and herbs with softened
butter. Halve the plums and then slice each half into thin slices
that can be fanned out. Ladle the soup into bowls; garnish with a
piece of the compound butter and the plums.

Casi-Style Chili

beef, stews, texan

4  jalape#o chiles stems & deveined, h; alved
4 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon paprika
2 lb beef chuck
1 medium onion, chopped
2 tablespoon kidney suet; chopped substitute vegeta
8 oz tomato sauce
12 oz beer
2 cup beef stock
3 teaspoon cumin, ground
2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon pepper, black
1/4 cup masa harina (finely ground maize fl; our)

Cut beef into 1-1/2" cubes.  Brown the meat and onions in oil or fat.

Add the tomato sauce, beer, beef stock, chiles, cumin, garlic, black
pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the Chili Powder. Simmer the chili over
a low head for 2 hours until the meat is tender.

To thicken, make a thin paste of the masa and water. Quickly stir
this into the chili -- if done too slowly it will lump.

Add the remaining Chili Powder and Paprika.  Simmer for an additional
15 minutes.  Remove the Jalapenos and serve.

[CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) chili-cookoff
winners tend to use blended chili powder and also Jalape#o chiles,
which are usually removed before serving. The beef is cubed, and
masa, which is flour made from ground dried maize available in Latin
markets, is used to thicken the chili.]

PLACE THE BEANS IN COLD WATER and soak overnight. The next day, place
a heavy pot on the stove over medium heat and cook the duck pieces on
both sides to render some of the fat. This takes about 15 minutes
total. Remove the duck and set aside. Increase heat to high and add
the pork. Brown well, remove from the pot and set aside. Brown the
lamb. Remove and set aside. Preheat oven to 300F. Pour off and
discard most of the fat, leaving just about 3 tablespoons in the pot.
Lower heat to medium and add the onions. Cook, stirring, until onions
soften, about 7 minutes. Add drained beans, bacon, garlic and herbs
and replace the duck, pork and lamb. Add 4 cups water, cover and
place in the oven for 2 hours. Add the sausages and salt as desired.
Replace in the oven another hour. Remove herbs in cheesecloth. When
it's time to serve dinner, place the casserole on the table.

Cathe's Clam Chowder

soups, cathe

6 slice bacon (or more)
1 large onion, chopped
24 oz clam juice, bottle (doxee brand)
1/2 teaspoon garlic, dried, minced
1 large potato, baking
10 oz baby clams, canned (orleans brand)
3 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup half & half (or more) (or cream )
1 teaspoon garlic salt (lowry's)
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Fry bacon in 3-quart pan until brown.  Reserve 2 T. bacon grease in
pan; remove bacon to paper towel to drain well. Crumble bacon and
save it for later. (Can cook bacon in microwave and transfer 2 T
grease to 3-quart pan.)

Saute chopped onion in bacon grease until translucent. Shake one of
the three bottles of clam juice well; add to the sauteed onion. Stir
in dried minced garlic and let come to a boil. Boil until the liquid
is reduced by half, but don't let the liquid get so low that the
sauteed onion and minced garlic brown.

Shake the other two bottles of clam juice well and add to the mixture
in the pan.  Bring to boil.

Scrub the baking potato well (or peel it, if you want to); cut it into
half-inch cubes.  Add to the boiling clam juice and reduce heat (to
low) -- so the mixture bubbles gently -- until the potatoes are
almost done.

Meanwhile, drain the baby clams, reserving the juice in a cup. Put the
clams aside.  Stir the cornstarch into the reserved clam juice,
blending well.

When the potatoes are just barely done, remove the pan from the heat.
Re-mix the cornstarch and clam juice and add to the soup, stirring
constantly as you pour the cornstarch mixture into the pan. Return
pan to heat and stir constantly until thickened. (This may seem too
thick.) Remove from heat and stir in the baby clams and the crumbled
bacon. Add half and half or cream until soup is the consistency you
want it. (If you don't want it so creamy, use milk or skim milk
instead.)

Add garlic salt and black pepper to taste; serve warm. Do not let the
soup boil once the baby clams are added; boiling will turn them into
rubber. This makes about a quart of soup, enough to serve 4 with no
leftovers.

Vicki's notes:

*  The recipe that Cathe gave me in the 70s called for only two
bottles of clam juice (instead of three), 1/2 C half & half (instead
of 1/4 C), 2 T cornstarch (instead of 3 T), 2 teaspoons minced garlic
(instead of 1/2 t), 1/4 t garlic salt (instead of 1 t), and no black
pepper or bacon (just 2 T drippings for frying).

It also called for 1/4 t each lemon pepper and sweet basil, 2 t dried
parsley, 3 drops Tabasco sauce and 1/4 C sauterne, none of which are
called for in this recipe. The only things the same are the potato,
the onion and the 10 oz. can for baby clams (Geisha). (The recipe
said you could substitute a 7 oz can of minced clams if you had to.)

soups, cathe

3 tablespoon butter (more if needed)
2 cup mushrooms, sliced
1/2 cup burgundy wine, hearty (or less)
2 tablespoon flour
2 cup half-and-half (or less)
1  salt, to taste
1  pepper, to taste

Saute mushrooms in butter until brown.  Add wine when mushrooms start
making their own juice; cook over medium heat until all liquid
evaporates and clear oil from butter is in pan, about 10 minutes.

Add flour and cook on high about 5 minutes; stir and blend, cook till
nut-brown.  (Like a medium brown roux, except for mushrooms and is
wine-colored.)  Can add more butter as necessary to make a smooth
"sauce" texture.  Stir constantly.

Stir in half-and-half (can substitute milk) until you have the
thickness or amount of soup you want; stir to creamy consistency.
Salt and pepper to taste.  Makes about 1 1/2 to 2 cups soup.

Cauliflower Soup (Minestra Di Cavalfiore)

italian, vegetables, soup/stew

1 large head cauliflower
2 tablespoon white or cider vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
4  to 6 cloves garlic
1/4 teaspoon to 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes
3 cup hot meat broth
1  salt
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
6 oz freshly grated pecorino cheese

"There's probably no sense in making this soup if you don't like
cauliflower.  As with so much Italian food, this recipe uses a few
basic ingredients to showcase the star vegetable. A purist would even
shudder at the cheese!  Make this soup as garlicky and spicy as you
like but be sure to serve lots of crusty Italian bread or bruschetta
(toasted Italian bread brushed with olive oil). When I want a soup
with a bit more texture, I remove 1 cup of the cooked cauliflower,
puree it, and return it to the remaining soup"

Break the cauliflower florets into small (1/2 inch) pieces. Trim the
stem end and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Wash the cauliflower in 2
quarts of cold water blended with 2 tablespoons of vinegar.  Drain
and drop into a large pot of boiling salted water. Boil for 4
minutes; drain and dry well.

Heat the olive oil in a soup pot; add the garlic and hot pepper, and
cook gently until the garlic is golden. Add the cauliflower and cook
for 5 minutes, stirring to prevent it from browning. Add the hot
broth, salt and parsley and cook until the cauliflower is tender.
Ladle into soup bowls and sprinkle with a generous amount of cheese.

Serves 6.

Celery Root Bisque With Peppered Croutons

irish, soups

6 tablespoon butter, unsalted
1 large onion; chopped
3  celery stalk; with leaves, sliced
2 1/4 lb celery root; peeled, coarsely chopped
2 medium russet potatoes, peeled, coarsely c; hopped
2 large parsnip; peeled, coarsely chopped
5 cup chicken stock or canned broth
1  bay leaf
4  thyme sprigs, fresh; or
1 teaspoon thyme, dried; crumbled
1/2 teaspoon pepper, white
1/4 teaspoon coriander seeds
2 cup spinach leaves
1/2 cup whipping cream
1  peppered croutons-see recipe

Melt butter in heavy large non-aluminum pot over medium heat. Add
onion and celery and saute until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
Add celery roots, potatoes and parsnips and saute 5 minutes. Add 3
cups stock, bay leaf, thyme, white pepper and coriander. Bring to
boil. Reduce heat, cover partially and simmer until vegetables are
very soft, about 25 minutes. Discard bay leaf and thyme sprigs.  Add
spinach to soup and cook until just wilted, stirring occasionally,
about 2 minutes.

Place soup in batches in processor.  Return soup to pot. Add cream and
remaining 2 cups stock and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Season with salt and white pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.
Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)

Ladle soup into bowls.  Sprinkle with croutons and serve.

"The Irish excel with root vegetables, and every home garden seems to
boast lush rows of celeriac, parsnips, turnips, leeks, rutabagas, and
potatoes. This savory bisque is a subtle and suave use of the humble
and often ignored celery root. Along with glasses of sherry, it makes
a great beginning to an elegant celebration of St. Patrick. Spinach
leaves add pretty green color to the bisque."

Cepe Consomme

french, soups, starters, vegetables

3 pint chicken stock
1/2 oz dried cepes
1  salt & pepper to taste
      ----OPTIONAL----
1 tablespoon dry madeira

Put stock - which should be home made and reasonably clear, and not
oversalted, in a saucepan and start heating gently while you wash the
dried cepes (porcini in Italian) in a sieve. Add the cepes to the
stock and when boiling, turn down to a very gentle simmer. Don't
cover, and allow to simmer until reduced to 2/3 volume. Strain and
allow to settle, as the cepes always give out a little sand, no
matter how carefully you wash them. When ready to serve, decant from
the sediment, reheat and season. Add the optional madeira and serve.

Charred Tomato Soup With Corn & Pepper Reli

soups, tomatoes

1 cup wood chips for smoking --
1  mesquite
2  ears corn
1  red bell pepper
2 1/2 lb roma tomatoes
2 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoon green onion -- thinly
1  sliced
2 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoon fresh sage -- minced
4  sprigs sage -- optional
4 pinch salt -- to taste

#1.  If using mesquite chips, soak them in water to cover for at
least 20 minutes or up to 1 hour. Remove husks and silks from about 1
3/4 pounds of corn on the cob. Stem, seed and halve lengthwise a red
or orange bell pepper. Select ripe romas or Italian plum tomatoes;
cut each in half lengthwise. #2. Drain chips well. In a barbecue with
a lid, scatter half the chips over a solid bed of very hot coals (you
can hold your hand at grill level only 1 second). For gas grills,
turn on high, let heat 10 minutes, then put half the chips in a foil
pan and set directly on flame in a corner of the grill. #3. Place
corn and pepper halves on a well-oiled grill 4 to 6 inches above
coals. Close lid, open vents, and cook until vegetables are lightly
charred, 8 to l0 minutes; turn occasionally during cooking. Remove
from grill and set aside. #4. Scatter remaining chips over the coals
(or place in the foil pan). Brush cut sides of tomatoes with olive
oil. Place tomatoes cut sides down on the grill. Close lid and cook
until tomatoes are slightly charred, about 7 minutes. With a spatula,
carefully remove tomatoes from grill. Reserve 4 nice-looking tomato
halves. #5. Place remaining tomatoes in a blender with the chicken
broth. Whirl until smooth; blend in batches if necessary. Transfer
tomato mixture to a 4- to 5-quart soup pan. Stir often over medium
heat until steaming, 8 to 10 minutes. #6. While soup heats, cut corn
from cobs and coarsely chop pepper. Mix together corn kernels,
pepper, green onion, lime juice, and sage leaves. #7. Divide tomato
soup equally among 4 bowls. Spoon equal amounts of corn relish into
the center of the soup. Lay 1 reserved tomato half, cut side up, next
to each pile of corn and garnish with a sage sprig. Add salt to taste.

Cherry Fruit Soup

cyberealm, fruits

1 x no ingredients

4  c  water 1/2 c sugar 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder pn cloves 1 tb
cornstarch 1 lb fresh cherries, pitted * 4 ripe peaches, stoned and
quartered 4 purple plums, stoned and quartered sour cream or plain
yogurt

*  you may substitute one, 16 ounce can of tart red cherries in water
If you are using canned cherries, drain them and replace 1 cup of the
water with 1 cup of cherry juice (3 cups of water and 1 cup of cherry
juice, instead of the 4 cups of water only).

In a saucepan, place the water or the water and cherry juice together
with the sugar, cinnamon, and cloves.

In a small bowl or measuring cup, dissolve the cornstarch into 1/4
cup of the liquid.  Add the dissolved cornstarch mixture to the
liquid in the pan. Bring to a boil.  Add the cherries, peaches, and
plums. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes.

This soup can be serve warm or cold, ungarnished or with a dollop of
sour cream or yogurt.  Makes 8 servings. NOTE: My mother always
served this as a cold soup before a dairy meal on a hot summer day.
The reason is obvious; fresh fruit was inexpensive and readily
available in the summertime.

She would buy overripe or bruised fruit from the greengrocer and
then would wash and cut away the badly bruised areas. She certainly
didn't bother removing the pits from the fruit. It was up to each of
us to do our own pitting with every mouthful. But I think this is
such an elegant and unusual soup that I always take the trouble to
remove the pits. Most canned cherries come already pitted.

Chestnut Soup With Amaretto

soups

2 lb chestnuts, fresh
2  carrot
2  parsnip
1  onion, small
1  garlic clove
2  scallion
3  celery stalk
4 tablespoon butter
5 cup brown stock
1  bouquet garni
3 tablespoon amaretto liqueur
1 cup cream, heavy
1  salt; to taste
1  pepper, black; to taste
1  cayenne pepper
1  nutmeg

Make a slash in the rounded side of each chestnut and roast in a pre-
heated 400 F. oven for 5 minutes. Peel off the shell and inner skin.
Peel the carrots, parsnip, onion, and garlic. Finely chop all of the
vegetables, including the scallions and celery.  Melt the butter in a
large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the vegetables and cook for
five minutes, or until soft but not brown.  Add the chestnuts, stock,
and bouquet garni. Gently simmer the soup for 40 minutes, or until
the chestnuts are very soft.

Remove the bouquet garni and puree the soup in a blender or food pro-
cessor.  Return the soup to the saucepan, adding the amaretto, two-
thirds of the cream, and salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and nutmeg to
taste; the soup should be very flavorful.  If a sweeter flavor is
desired, add a spoonful of brown sugar.

To serve, ladle the chestnut soup into warmed bowls. Pour a little of
the remaining cream into each bowl and marble it into the soup,
stirring with a skewer. Chestnut soup is extremely rich, so keep the
rest of the meal simple.

Chestnut-And-Lentil Soup

vegetarian

1 lb chestnuts
1  light oil
1 cup french green lentils =or=- brown le; ntils
2 quart water
1 medium carrot  diced into  small, even squ; ares
1  celery stalk  cut into small square; s
1/2 small onion; finely diced
1 large garlic clove  peeled and finely cho; pped
1  bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon salt; or to taste
5  parsley sprigs
      ----FINISHING THE SOUP----
3 tablespoon light olive oil chestnuts (from abo; ve)
1 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh marjoram -or- dried m; arjoram
1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed  (or ground)
1  fresh thyme sprigs; -=or=- (generous) dried t
1/2 cup dry white wine

1  salt
1  freshly milled black pepper
1  extra-virgin olive oil
1  finely chopped parsley
1  small croutons, fried (in butter or; oil) (optional)

PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Score chestnuts on their rounded sides and toss
them in just enough oil to lightly coat them. Place chestnuts on
baking sheet. Bake until skins have opened and meat is tender, about
20 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel and dice them into small
pieces. Set aside. Rinse lentils and combine them in soup pot with
the water. Bring to boil. Cook a few minutes at gentle boil, removing
foam that forms on surface. Add carrot, celery, onion, garlic, bay
leaf, salt and parsley. Lower heat and simmer until lentils are
tender, about 35 minutes. When done, remove parsley sprigs and bay
leaf. Correct seasoning and add salt, if necessary. Puree half the
lentils until smooth, then recombine them with the rest. FINISHING
THE SOUP: In pan large enough to hold soup, warm olive oil, then add
roasted chestnuts and herbs. Cook over medium heat, stirring
frequently, for several minutes. Add wine and tomato paste. Stir to
dissolve tomato paste and cook a few minutes to reduce wine. Stir in
lentil mixture and simmer gently 20 minutes. If soup is too thick,
thin it with a little water, stock or cream until of right
consistency. Taste for salt and season with pepper. Serve with
spoonful of olive oil swirled into each bowl. Sprinkle with parsley
and croutons, if desired.

Chick Pea Soup

soups

1 lb chick peas
2 tablespoon baking soda
4 small onions (or fewer), chopped
3/4 cup olive oil
2 teaspoon salt
1  lemon juice

Soak the chick peas in water overnight.  Drain the chick peas and
sprinkle the baking soda on them. Stir them a little and let them
stand for one hour.

Rinse the chick peas with plenty of water.  Put them in a pot and
cover them with water. Bring them to a boil, then lower heat to
medium. Skim off the scum that forms on the surface, and then add the
onions. Cover and cook on low heat for about two hours or until the
chick peas are soft. (If necessary, add some hot water into the pot
while the chick peas are cooking).

Add the olive oil and salt, and cook for a few more minutes.  Serve
with a dash of lemon juice, plenty of fresh bread and, if you like, a
chunk of feta cheese on the side.

You're supposed to remove the skin off the chick peas.  I was never
able to do it (it comes off only with some difficulty, and you have
to do it for each individual pea), but it doesn't seem to affect the
dish adversely.

You know that the soup is done when the chick peas begin to dissolve,
making the soup rather thick. This might not give the dish a very
attractive appearance, but the taste is an entirely different matter.

NOTES:

*  Greek style chick-pea soup -- I got this recipe from a Greek
cookbook. It is the standard way of cooking chick peas in Greece.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  overnight soak, 2-3 hours cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Chicken & Andouille Gumbo

cajun, soup/stew

1 cup oil
1 1/2 lb andouille sausage; or kielb
3 3/4 cup onions; chopped
2 cup green pepper; chopped
8 1/2 cup chicken stock
1 single cayenne pepper
1 single file
1 single cooked rice
1 each chicken; cut up or boned
1 cup flour
2 cup celery; chopped
3 teaspoon garlic; chopped
1 single salt
2 cup green onion; chopped
1 single cream sherry

Season and brown chicken in oil (lard, bacon drippings) over med-hi
heat. Add sausage (cut in 1/4" rounds) to pot and saute with chicken.
Remove both from pot. Make roux with equal parts of oil and flour to
desired color (I make a dark chestnut color). Add onions, celery,
green pepper, and later garlic to roux, stir continuously until
vegetables reach desired tenderness. Return chicken and sausage to
pot and cook with vegetables, continuing to stir frequently.
Gradually stir in liquid and bring to boil. Reduce to simmer and cook
for an hour or more. Season to taste. Approximately 10 minutes before
serving, add green onions. Gumbo may or may not be served over rice.
Adding sherry at the table is also an option. File may be placed on
the table for individuals to add to their gumbo if they wish.  1/4 to
1/2 tsp per serving is recommended. File - a fine green powder that
is young dried and ground sassafras leaves, used in gumbo for flavor
and thickening.  The word file means to twist or make threads. If you
put the file directly into the gumbo while it is cooking, that is
what you will end up with, a liquid that is rather stringy as you
bring your spoon out of the bowl. Ugh!  Do it right, let each person
add their own at the table. If making roux over very high heat, the
oil you use must be free of food particles to avoid burning. If you
scorch your roux, even slightly, while you are making it, throw it
out, and start over again after you have thoroughly cleaned the pot.
When making an okra gumbo, add 4-6 cups of cut okra to trinity,
saute, and cook together with roux. (remember, the Cajun cooking
trinity is onions, celery and green pepper).

crisp on all sides.  Remove from heat. Remove chicken with a slotted
spoon; set aside.  Loosen any browned bits from the bottom of pan;
strain fat to remove particles.  Add enough lard to strained fat to
equal 1 cup.  Add fat back to pot over medium-low heat.
Add reserved flour; whisk until a smooth mahogany-colored roux,
about 45 minutes.  Remove from heat; add onion, bell pepper and
celery at once; stir to blend and prevent browning.  Cook until
vegetabloes are wilted and onion is transparent.  *SLOWLY* stir in
stock; stir until combined before adding more.  When all stock has
been added, bring to a full boil.  Reduce heat; add sausage, garlic,
salt, black pepper and cayenne.  Add browned chicken; simmer 25
minutes, stirring often.  Add okra; cook 20 minutes. Remove from
heat; stir in green onions and parsley.  To serve, place 1/2 cup rice

Chicken & Coconut Milk Soup (Gaeng Com Yam

soups, thai

5 cup thin coconut milk
1 small chicken, sectioned and cut into bit; e-sized pieces (bone-in)
3  stalks lemon grass, bruised and cut; into 1 lengths
2 teaspoon laos powder (ka)
3  green onions, finely chopped
2 tablespoon coriander leaves, chipped
4  to 6 fresh serrano chillies, seeded; and chopped
1  juice of 2 limes
3 tablespoon fish sauce (nam pla)

Here's another classic "Tom Yam" type chicken soup. The "Laos" powder
is dried galangal, powdered.  Unlike ginger, dried galangal seems to
retain most of it's character. If you use canned coconut milk, the
"Thin" milk is the more watery liquid in the can.  The thick
condensed stuff is coconut "cream" (not to be confused with the
syrupy sweet coconut cream used for Pina Coladas). If you shake the
can up and combine the two, you have thick coconut milk.

A lovely lemony, creamy soup, Dom Yam Gai calls for chicken pieces cut
through the bone with a heavy cleaver, Chinese style. If you find
gnawing on chicken pieces and delicately trying to remove the bone,
vainly searching for a place to deposit it, inhibiting your dinner
conversation, you may debone the bird and substitute chicken pieces.
In either case, use both dark and light meats for color and nutrition.

[Although if you're talking at the table, ya got no reason to be
eating a dish this good!  S.C.  ;-} ]

In a saucepan, bring the "Thin" coconut milk to a boil. Add the
chicken pieces, lemon grass and Laos powder. Reduce heat and simmer
until the chicken is tender, about 15 minutes. Do not cover as this
will tend to curdle coconut milk.  When the chicken is tender, add
the green onions, coriander leaves and chillies. Bring the heat up
just below boiling. Remove the pan from heat, stir in lime juice,
fish sauce and serve.

NOTE:  Beef cut into thin strips or firm white fish pieces may be
substituted for chicken.

Chicken & Coconut Milk Soup (Gaeng Com Yam Ga

soups

5 cup thin coconut milk
1 small chicken, sectioned and cut into bit; e-sized pieces (bone-in)
3  stalks lemon grass, bruised and cut; into 1 lengths
2 teaspoon laos powder (ka)
3  green onions, finely chopped
2 tablespoon coriander leaves, chipped
4  to 6 fresh serrano chillies, seeded; and chopped
1  juice of 2 limes
3 tablespoon fish sauce (nam pla)

Here's another classic "Tom Yam" type chicken soup. The "Laos" powder
is dried galangal, powdered.  Unlike ginger, dried galangal seems to
retain most of it's character. If you use canned coconut milk, the
"Thin" milk is the more watery liquid in the can.  The thick
condensed stuff is coconut "cream" (not to be confused with the
syrupy sweet coconut cream used for Pina Coladas). If you shake the
can up and combine the two, you have thick coconut milk.

A lovely lemony, creamy soup, Dom Yam Gai calls for chicken pieces cut
through the bone with a heavy cleaver, Chinese style. If you find
gnawing on chicken pieces and delicately trying to remove the bone,
vainly searching for a place to deposit it, inhibiting your dinner
conversation, you may debone the bird and substitute chicken pieces.
In either case, use both dark and light meats for color and nutrition.

[Although if you're talking at the table, ya got no reason to be
eating a dish this good!  S.C.  ;-} ]

In a saucepan, bring the "Thin" coconut milk to a boil. Add the
chicken pieces, lemon grass and Laos powder. Reduce heat and simmer
until the chicken is tender, about 15 minutes. Do not cover as this
will tend to curdle coconut milk.  When the chicken is tender, add
the green onions, coriander leaves and chillies. Bring the heat up
just below boiling. Remove the pan from heat, stir in lime juice,
fish sauce and serve.

NOTE:  Beef cut into thin strips or firm white fish pieces may be
substituted for chicken.

Chicken & Egg Soup/Stracciatella

soups

10 fl oz chicken stock or water with
1/2  chicken stock cube
2  eggs
1/2 tablespoon semolina
1 tablespoon grated parmesan or other strongly f; lavoured cheese
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1  salt and black pepper

This is a very light but satisfying classic soup. It is often called
Stracciatella. Don't worry ifthe soup has a slightly scrambled egg
look, it should do.

Pour most ofthe stock or water into a saucepan, add the chicken stock
cube. Bring the stock or water to the boil. Beat the eggs, blend with
the rest of the cold stock or water, the semolina and cheese. Pour a
little of the boiling liquid over the egg mixture, then return to the
saucepan. Cook over a steady heat for 3 or 4 minutes, do not allow to
boil. Add the parsley and seasoning to taste then serve.

Chicken & Noodle Soup With Vegetables

soups

1  5-6 lb chicken or
1 lb chicken gizzards
2 lb chicken backs and
1 lb legs and thighs
3 quart water
1  onion stuck with 2 cloves
1  leek
1  carrot
1  ; salt
10  peppercorns
1/2 cup onion; finely chopped
1/2 cup carrots; finely diced
1/2 cup green beans; finely cut
4 oz egg noodles
1 cup frozen or fresh peas
1  parsley; chopped

Place the whole chicken or the chicken pieces in a heavy 6-quart
kettle with the water, onion stuck with cloves, leek, carrot, 1
tablespoon salt, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil and skim off any
scum that forms on top. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours.
Correct the seasoning. If you are using chicken parts, cook until
they are tender 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the chicken, skim excess
fat from the broth, and then remove the vegetables.  (If you are not
serving the soup till the next day, it will be easier to remove the
fat if the broth is cooled and then chilled.) Pour the broth into a
container, wash out the kettle, and then return the broth to it.  Add
the cut vegetables, the meat from the legs and thighs cut into small
dice, and the gizzards thinly sliced. Bring to a boil again and cook
just until the vegetables begin to tenderize and are pleasantly firm.
Add the noodles (increase the amount if you like a very thick soup)
and peas, and boil for 5 to 9 minutes or until they are cooked. Serve
in heated soup plates or bowls and sprinkle with some chopped parsley.

This deliciously filling soup is ideal for a Sunday supper,
accompanied by buttered toast or hot rolls, perhaps followed by a
salad or some excellent cheese and a bottle of red wine.

Note:  Other vegetables, such as spinach, cabbage, and zucchini, as
well as mushrooms, may be added to the soup during the final cooking.

1 each onion, large and chopped
2 tablespoon flour
1 single salt/pepper to tatse
16 oz sausage, smoked link
1 each fresh tomatoe, or 16 oz can
2 tablespoon shortening or oil
3 quart water

Cut up chicken, remove skin if ya like. Dredge the chicken with
flour salt and pepper. Fry the chicken until brown. Slice up a pound
of the link sausage... for a hotter sausage, try the Louisiana
'Andouie', if available. After the chicken is browned, place sausage
in the same skilett... use a heavy iron one. Brown the sausage, on
both sides. Save the grease from chicken and sausage.
Fry the tomatoe, onion and okra in about 2 T shortening or oil,
until they become tender.
Make a roux with 2 ts oil and 2 ts flour, stir and brown over a
medium-low heat until the roux is as dark as possible without burning
it. Do not burn the roux... just make it real dark.
Place chicken and sausage in the roux, stir a bit. Then place all
ingredients into a heavy, deep iron pan, add water and cook about 2
hours. Cook slow, add water if needed. The okra will thicken the
gumbo as it cooks. 

Chicken & Vegetable Soup With Tiny Meatball

chicken, pork, soups, vegetables

3 quart chicken stock
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 medium onions, diced
2  ribs celery, diced
1 medium carrot, scrubbed and diced
2 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon brandy
1 large turnip, peeled and diced
1/4 large butternut squash, peeled, seeded an; d diced
1  thick slice crusty french or otalia; n bread
3 small cloves garlic
1  egg
12 oz boned and skin cooked chicken, coar; sely diced
4 oz best quality smoked ham, coarsely d; iced
1  freshly ground black pepper
1  small sprigs fresh basil and/or par; sley
1  unbleached all-purpose flour
1  salt to taste

Bring the stock to a boil in a large soup pot.  Turn the heat down to
low and let simmer, uncovered, while you continue.

Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions
and saute for 2 or 3 minutes.  Add the celery and carrot; saute for
another 5 minutes, then add the vegetables to the simmering chicken
stock along with the tomato paste, brandy, turnip and butternut
squash. Simmer gently, covered, until the vegetables are tender,
about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the meatballs.  In a food processor whizz together the
bread, garlic and egg for about 30 seconds until a smooth paste is
formed. Add the chicken, ham, pepper and the basil and/or parsley.
Pulse-chop 10 to 15 times, then process until a smooth, very thick
paste is formed.

Roll the meat paste into balls the size of a large marble. Roll the
balls in the flour so that they are lightly dusted all over.

When the vegetables are tender, raise the heat slightly so that the
soup simmers with a little more intensity. Drop the meatballs into
the soup and let cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Taste for seasoning and
adjust if necessary. Be careful not to oversalt as the ham is salty.
Serve immediately.

Serves 6 to 8 as an entre with bread and salad.

NOTE:  This is even better the next day, but first remove the
meatballs and wrap them separately rather than storing them overnight
with the broth.

Chicken Vegetable Soup

poultry

1/2 cup dried pearl barley
1  chicken (2-2.5 lb), cut into quarte; rs
4 cup defatted chicken broth
2 cup water
2 large onions, cut into 1/2 pieces
3 medium carrots, cut into 1/4 rounds
3 medium parsnips, cut into 1/2 rounds
3  celery ribs, cut into 1/2 pieces
6 medium mushrooms, each cut into 6 pieces
1/2 cup dried green or yellow split peas
2 teaspoon chopped fresh dill

Chicken broth is added along with water to give this soup a more
intense flavor. Don't cook the chicken for more than the one hour
called for, or it will dry out and become tough.

1. Rinse, then soak the barley in cold water for 1/2 hour. Drain and
set aside.

2. Clean the chicken well and place in a large, heavy soup pot. Add
the chicken broth and water to cover the bird, then bring to a boil
over high heat, uncovered. When the liquid starts to boil, add the
barley and all remaining ingredients except the dill; stir. When the
soup returns to a boil, reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cook,
partially covered, for 1 hour or until the chicken is cooked through
and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.

3. Remove the chicken from the pot. When cool enough to handle,
discard the skin, shred the meat into large pieces and return about a
third of it to the pot. (Save the remaining meat for another use,
such as a salad.) Just before serving, stir in the dill.

Chicken With Garlic

main dish, poultry

2  chickens or chicken breasts
2 small heads garlic
1  water
1/4 cup chopped italian parsley
1  salt and pepper
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 large lemon; juiced

If using whole chickens, halve chickens and bone completely except
for wing joint.  If only using breasts, bone completely. Place the
heads of garlic in water to cover in a small saucepan and bring to a
boil. Drain. Peel the garlic and cut each clove into paper-thin
slices. Toss in a bowl with the parsley, and season to taste with
salt and pepper. Loosen the chicken skin and stuff about 2 teaspoons
garlic mixture between the skin and the meat. Reserve remaining
garlic mixture. Set chicken aside. Prepare hot coals in a grill.
When the coals are ready, grill the chicken 5 to 7 minutes on each
side, or until the flesh is no longer pink. Do not overcook the
chicken or it will become dry. Heat the butter in a skillet, add the
reserved garlic mixture, and saute a few seconds. Add the lemon juice
and adjust seasonings.  Heat through. Place the chicken on a large
heated platter and spoon the garlic sauce over it.

Chicken With Ham & Provalone Cheese

none

3  whole chicken breasts
9  slices cured polish ham
2 1/2 tablespoon seedless raspberry jam
1 1/2 cup uncooked rice
3 cup water
1 1/2 lb broccoli
7  slices provalone cheese

Use vegetable oil or cooking spray to lightly grease a large baking
dish. (I used a 9x12" cake tin.)  Remove the broccoli heads from the
stems. Trim the stems, slice and chop coarsely like celery. Put the
rice and the chopped broccoli stems in the bottom of the baking dish.
Spread the ham slices with raspberry jam and wrap them (raspberry
side down) around all sides of each chicken breast. Arrange the
chicken breasts down the center of the dish, break the broccoli head
into pieces and place around the chicken.  Add 3 c. water.

Cover and bake 45 min. at 350'F.  Remove dish from oven (to check
chicken for doneness, cut into it with a knife or fork -- meat should
be white, juices should run clear), cover chicken breasts with slices
of cheese and put additional pieces of cheese over the rice and
broccoli, then return to oven and bake uncovered another 5-10 min.
until cheese is melted. It will look & smell wonderful!  Split
chicken breasts to serve 4-6.

I suppose this is similar to chicken cordon bleu (?), but it seemed
much easier than stuffing deboned chicken breasts, and the rice and
broccoli are delicious cooked this way.  I didn't add salt, pepper,
or other seasonings because the ham I used was so delicious and
strongly flavored; use your judgement. Asparagus and/or mushrooms
would probably be good substitutes for the broccoli.  I liked the
subtle flavor added by the raspberry jam, which was not too sweet;
probably you could substitute another jam or a small amount of honey.

Chicken With Mandarines & Pomegranate

poultry

1  stephen ceideburg
2  mandarines
1  chicken
1  sprigs thyme
3  mandarines, juice only
1  pomegranate, juice only
1  pomegranate, quartered, seeds reser; ved
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 tablespoon flour

This very seasonal dish - both mandarines and pomegranates are well
into their seasons now - is simple but unusual.

Segment 2 mandarines, being careful to remove as much pith as
possible, and if possible remove the seeds.

Remove the fatty pads from the cavity of a chicken and put the
chicken in an ovenproof dish, preferably a glass chicken roaster to
maximise final moistness. Surround the chicken with the mandarine
segments and a few sprigs of thyme. Halve and juice 3 more mandarines
and pour the juice over the chicken. Juice half a pomegranate and
add. Season. Roast in a 190 C oven for about an hour or until the
juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced with
a skewer. If not using a glass roaster with a lid, baste at intervals
during cooking.

Meanwhile cut another pomegranate into quarters and twist each wedge
to help free the seeds. Coax them out and reserve. Work together a
tablespoon of softened butter and a tablespoon of plain flour (to
make a buerre manie).

When the chicken is cooked, remove it and the mandarine segments to a
serving dish and keep warm.

Skim the sauce if necessary, then simmer it and add the beurre manie
in small pieces, whisking all the time until it is sufficiently
thickened. Taste the sauce for seasoning and pour over the chicken
and mandarines. Scatter the pomegranate seeds over the mandarine
segments and serve.

Chicken With Mushroom Soup

soups

1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoon butter
6 cup chicken stock
1 cup cooked chicken
1/2 cup white rice, uncooked
2 tablespoon lemon juice
1  chopped green onions for garnish

Saute the mushrooms in the butter.  Add to the soup stock along with
the chicken and rice.  Cook until the rice is puffy, and serve with a
little lemon juice and chopped green onions in a bowl.

To make the chicken stock, simply boil some chicken in water until
the meat is falling off the bones.  Remove the chicken and the liquid

Chicken With Port~ Cream & Mushrooms

main dish, poultry

1  whole chicken (3 lb)
1 lb fresh mushrooms
1/2 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch; blended with  of the crea
1 tablespoon minced shallots
1/3 cup port wine madeira may be substitute; d
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup cognac or a good brandy

PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Truss the chicken, then dry the outside
thoroughly and rub with 1 tablespoon butter all over the skin. TO
BROWN THE CHICKEN: Set the chicken on a rack, breast side up in the
roasting pan, place in the oven for 5 minutes. Turn on its left side
and baste quickly with butter, return to the oven for another 5
minutes. Turn on its right side for another 5 minutes, basting as
before. TO ROAST THE CHICKEN: Leave the chicken on its right side.
Reduce oven temperature to 350F. Leave it for a total of 15-20
minutes, basting it at least every 10 minutes. Salt the chicken, turn
it on its other side, and cook another 15-20 minutes, basting at
least every 20 minutes. Turn the chicken breast up and continue
basting every 10 minutes during the last few minutes it is roasting.
TO TELL IF THE CHICKEN IS DONE: Prick the thickest part of the
drumstick with a fork. If the juices come out clear yellow, it is
done. If not, roast another 5 minutes and test again. As a final
check, lift the chicken and drain the juices from its vent into the
pan; if the last few drops are clear yellow, it is definitely done.
Put the chicken on a warm platter, remove the trussing string, and
let it sit at least 5-10 minutes before carving so that the juices
will not retreat into the tissues. It can wait a good 30 minutes with
foil over it. As the chicken roasts, wipe the mushrooms clean with a
paper towel, cut off the ends and slice them; if small, leave whole.
Bring 1/4 cup water to a boil with 1/2 tablespoon butter, lemon juice
and salt. Add mushrooms, cover and cook for 8 minutes. Separate the
cooking liquid and save it. Pour the cream and cornstarch and cream
mixture into the mushrooms. Simmer for 2 minutes. Taste and correct
seasoning and hold. When the chicken is done, remove it to its
platter and remove all but 2 table- spoons of fat from the pan. Stir
in the shallots and saute for 1 minute. Add the port and mushroom
juices and reduce rapidly while deglazing the pan (scraping up the
coagulated juices) until the liquid has reduced to about 1/4 cup. Add
the mushrooms and cream. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, allowing the liquid
to thicken slightly. Taste and correct seasoning; add more lemon
juice to taste. Butter the inside of a casserole with butter; rapidly
carve the chicken into serving pieces and sprinkle lightly with salt.
Arrange it in the casserole for serving. Warm the cognac carefully,
do not let it catch on fire. Set the chicken over moderate heat until
you hear it begin to sizzle; pour the cognac over it and ignite it
carefully with a match. Shake the casserole slowly till the flames
have subsided. Pour the mushroom mixture over the casserole, basting
the chicken. Cover and let it steep for 5 minutes. Do not allow the
sauce to boil. Serve immediately.

1 tablespoon butter; melted
1 tablespoon oil
1/2 cup white wine
3/4 cup chicken stock
3/4 cup whipping cream
1  salt & white pepper to taste
1  rosemary sprigs; for garnish

Preheat oven to 400 F.

Put 2 whole rosemary sprigs into cavity of chicken. Truss (skewer or

Chicken-And-Vegetable Soup

poultry, soups

2  boiling chickens, 4 lbs ea.  cut in; quarters
10 cup cold water
4 medium carrots; thinly sliced
2 medium yellow onions  peeled, finely diced
1 small head celery; thinly sliced
2 large leeks; green tops and white  bot
1/2 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
6  bay leaves
4  sprigs fresh thyme; -=or=- fresh thyme leaves
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon unsalted butter

COMBINE CHICKENS AND WATER in a 5-quart stockpot. Cover, bring to a
boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and skim off the scum that
accumulates on the surface. Remove chicken breast quarters and set
aside. Add 2 cups carrots, 1 cup onions, 2 cups celery, green leek
tops, peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme and salt. Cover and simmer for
45 minutes. Remove cover, replace the chicken breasts and continue to
cook for another 25 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the white parts of
leeks into 1/4-inch rounds and wash well to remove any sand. You
should have about 1 cup. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over
medium heat and add the leeks and the remaining carrots, onions and
celery. Cover and cook gently until vegetables are soft, about 5
minutes. Remove the chicken from the liquid and place on a platter.
Strain the liquid through a fine strainer into a large plastic
container and discard the herbs, spices and the cooked soup
vegetables. Skim and discard any fat from the surface of the broth.
Remove and discard chicken skin. Remove the meat from the bones, dice
it and set aside. Place bones in an airtight freezer container and
save for making stock. Immediately prior to serving, transfer broth
to a pot and heat, covered, over high heat. Heat chicken and
vegetables, covered, in 350F oven until hot. Decorate each soup bowl
with some heated diced vegetables and chicken. Pour the hot broth
into a pitcher or soup tureen and pour the soup into the garnished
bowls at the table.

Chicken-Thyme Stew With Sour Cream

cyberealm, poultry, stews

15 oz boneless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon + 1 tsp olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 centiliter garlic, minced
1 tablespoon flour
1 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
1 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoon chopped parsley
1 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon chicken seasoning(i added)
1 oz (2 t) dry sherry
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup nonfat sour cream

1. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces. In a large nonstick
skillet, over medium high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until
hot but not smoking. Add the chicken and cook, stirring until
browned, about 3-5 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and cover
loosely to keep warm.

2. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil to the skillet. Add the onion
and garlic, and cook, stirring until the onion begins to brown (3-5
minutes). Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, until the flour is no
longer visible, about 30 seconds.

3. Add the mushrooms, chicken broth, parsley, sherry, thyme, and
pepper, and bring to a boil, stirring, until the mixutre has
thickened slightly. Return the chicken to the skillet and cook until
heated through, about 1 minute.

4. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sour cream.

NOTE: You can make this ahead of time, reserving the addition of the
sour cream just before you serve it. I served this over cooked egg
noodles, with French bread and chunky applesauce, and it was GREAT!

1  juice of 4-5 limes
2 oz calvados apple brandy
1 pint apple juice
1  juice of 1 orange
1/3  white wine; riesling
1/4 cup golden raisins
1 cup cream
1 cup plain yogurt
1 tablespoon fresh mint; chopped
1/8 teaspoon each, cumin, allspice, nutme

Recipe by: Jo Merrill * Peel, core, cut into eighths and set aside in
lemon water. Remove apples from water and place in 4-quart stock pot
with half the Reisling, half the Calvados and all remaining
ingredients except the cream and yogurt. Bring to a boil, and reduce
to a simmer. Cook for 20-30 minutes.  Remove from heat and force
contents of pot through strainer. Puree ingredients that remain in
strainer and return to the liquid. Chill soup over ice.  Whisk in
yogurt and cream and serve in iced glasses. Note: This recipe did not
say what to do with the remaining Reisling and Calvados. I think it
would be added after the soup is chilled if you wish a stronger taste
of those 2 ingredients. This recipe is from the world famous Prince
of Wales Grill at the Hotel Del Coronado in Coronado, California---Jo

Chinese Beef Stew

chinese, stews

3 lb brisket of beef or stew beef
4 tablespoon peanut oil
      ----SAUCE----
2 ml fermented red bean cake *
3 tablespoon hoisin sauce
4 tablespoon shaoxing wine or dry sherry
4 tablespoon thin soy sauce
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1  whole star anise
1 teaspoon roasted and crushed szechwan pepper; corns
1 teaspoon five spice powder
2 teaspoon sugar
6 cup water
1 large (about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs) chinese (ici; cle) radish, roll cut.

Tough beef is most flavorful, but you must simmer it gently for
several hours to soften the sinewy muscle.  Slow braising also
encourages an exchange of flavors between the meat and the tangy
sauce, enhancing both. Chinese radish adds just the right bite, much
as turnips would in a Western stew.  In effect, this is Chinese beef
stew.

Game meats or goat meat may be substituted for the beef for a
delicious and unusual variation.  Oxtails can also be braised in this
manner, or even veal shanks.  Almost any cut of meat or organ that
requires extensive cooking does well if braised.  The strong sauce
keeps the meat flavorful throughout.

Turnips or carrots may be substituted for the Chinese radish, and
chestnuts have a strong, sweet taste that holds up well to braising.
[Make a diagonal slice, roll daikon 1/4 turn and slice again.
Continue rolling and cutting until done. S.C.]

* [This is nice if you have some laying around, but don't worry if you
don't.  The taste can be somewhat bizarre for a Westerner, but it
won't overwhelm the dish S.C.]

1.  The preferred cut is brisket of beef, a boneless piece of tough
meat from the underside of the steer, because of its rich, gelatinous
texture when cooked.  It is sold in Chinese meat markets as Chinese
stew beef. Any tough beef cut can be used, such as boneless chuck and
bottom round.

2.  Trim away the outer layers of fat.

Chinese Chicken & Mushroom Soup

chinese, poultry, starters, vegetables

110 gm chicken leg meat; skinned
1 tablespoon sherry; or rice wine
1 tablespoon light soy sauce; (1)
25 gm chinese dried mushrooms
1100 liter chicken stock
1 tablespoon spring onions; chopped
25 gm raw ham; or lean bacon
1 tablespoon light soy sauce; (2)
2 teaspoon oil

Soak the mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the
chicken into 1 cm. cubes. Put them in a bowl together with the sherry
or rice wine and the soy sauce (1) and let the mixture stand 10
minutes or so. When the mushrooms have soaked, drain them and squeeze
out excess liquid. Remove and discard the stems and finely shred the
caps into thin strips. Finely shred the ham or bacon (should be
smoked) into thin strips.
:    Bring the stock to a simmer in a large pot. Drain the marinade
(but not the chicken cubes) into the stock. Add the mushrooms, finely
chopped spring onions, ham or bacon and remaining soy sauce (2).
Continue to simmer the soup and meanwhile heat the oil in a wok or
large frying pan. When really hot, stir fry the chicken over high
heat until they are nicely brown - this should take about 5 minutes.
Drain them on kitchen paper and then add them to the soup. Simmer
together for 5 minutes and the soup is ready to serve.
Notes. This soup would also go well with French bread and butter
for a non chinese meal. It also re-heats well, tasting even better
when made one day and eaten the next.

Peel and grate in long thin shreads, the carrots and add finely diced

To quote Mme. Benoit,"This traditional Quebec dish is still very much
alive.  My grandmother's recipe is, as far as I am concerned, the best
there is." Note: from Anne - it seems as oysters were used at
Christmas. My maternal grandmother from the American midwest had a

Chuck-Wagon Bean Pot

crockpot, soups

1 lb bean (any variety), dry
1  ham hock or shank
1 large onion, chopped
6 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
7 oz green chili salsa (up to 10 oz; or use tomato sauce, cann

Rinse the beans and remove any foreign matter.  Mix all ingredients
in the cooking vessel.

IF USING A SLOW-COOKER:  Cover, set temperature at low, and forget
for at least 10 hours.  If you have only half a day, cook the mixture
5 or more hours on high.

IF USING A STOVE:  Heat all ingredients to boiling with pot
uncovered. Turn down heat, cover, and simmer gently, adding enough
boiling water to keep beans well covered. Most bean varieties will be
done in 2 to 3 hours.

When beans are done, take out ham bone, cut off the meat and put it
back into the pot. Serve hot with corn bread or muffins. Green chili
salsa is a Mexican sauce made from green chili peppers, onions,
vinegar and other ingredients.

NOTES:

*  A Hearty Bean Stew -- I got this recipe from "A Primer on Bean
Cookery" by the California Dry Bean Advisory Board and other
organizations. This savory stew, featuring ham and beans, borrows its
robust seasonings from the chuck wagon cooks of the old western
cattle ranges. The secret is long, slow cooking, and your electric
slow-cooker is ideal for the job. Just follow the directions that
come with your particular model. If you don't have one, slow-cook the
mixture on top of the stove in a heavy pot with a lid.

: Difficulty:  Easy
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, many hours cooking.

1  salt and pepper
1  several sprigs of dill and savory,; chopped
1 1/2 quart water
2  egg yolks
1/2 cup heavy cream (sweet or sour)
1 tablespoon vinegar

Your will need a large soup pot.  Chop up one slice of bacon, and fry
it in a heavy stewpan until the fat runs. Fry the onions in the fat
until they are golden. Add the peppers and fry them, too. Remove the
stewpan from the heat.  Layer the cabbage and the rest of the bacon
into the soup pot. Season between the layers with salt, pepper, and
the herbs.

Pour the water over it all and bring to a boil.  Turn the heat down
and simmer the soup for 40 to 50 minutes, until the vegetables are
tender. Remove the soup from the heat.

Beat the egg yolks with the cream and the vinegar in a little bowl.
Stir in a ladleful of the hot soup. Whisk well and pour the mixture

Clam Chowder #2

seafood, soups/stews

1/2 lb bacon
1 large onion chopped
2  ribs celery peeled and
1  diced
5 small can minced clams or
1 large can (about 51-oz)
2 teaspoon seafood chesapeake brand
1  bay-style seafood
1  seasoning
1 quart (4 cup) half and half
1  divided
2 tablespoon flour

The day before you wish to serve the soup, fry the bacon until crisp
and remove. In bacon drippings, saute onion, celery with leaves and
potatoes for 10-15 minutes at medium heat. Add the minced clams, not
clam soup but clams, with their juice. Crumble the bacon and add.
Cover soup and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, for
several hours - up to five hours won't hurt. Cool down and place in
refrigerator at night. On the day of serving, skim grease off top.
Transfer soup to larger pot. Heat soup until bubbling and add the
seafood seasoning. Mix 2 cups of the half and half with the flour.
Add to the chowder and stir until it bubbles again. Mix in remaining
half and half and simmer, stirring constantly, until soup is desired
thickness. Serve hot with garlic bread and a green salad.

Clam Chowder ( Monterey )

soups

1  carrot, diced (1)
1 medium onion, diced (1 1/2)
1  potato, diced (2)
1  stalk of celery, diced (2)
1/2 lb minced bacon (3/4 lb.)
1/4 lb margarine (i used butter, 1 1/2 cub; es)
3  cloves fresh garlic, minced (5)
1/2 quart clam juice (i used 3- 8 oz bottles)
1 1/2 cup flour (2 1/4 c.)
2 cup milk (3 c.)
2 cup heavy whipping cream (3 c.)
2 cup half-and-half (3 c.)
1/2 teaspoon black pepper (1 tsp., don't salt!)
1/2 lb chopped clams (fresh, frozen or can; ned) (3 lb. can)
1/2 teaspoon clam base (optional, available in m; ost gourmet shops)

(I made 1 1/2 times this amount - see parenthesis for amt.)

Place vegetables, bacon and margarine in a 5 quart sauce pot. Saute
over medium heat until vegetables are tender.  Be careful not to
brown or scorch.

When vegetables are tender, add flour to make a roux.  Cook for two
minutes, allowing flour to cook while stirring occasionally.

Add clam juice and dairy products.  Stir by using a wire whip.

Add fresh garlic, black pepper, chopped clams and clam base. Cook over
low-medium heat stirring occasionally to prevent chowder from
scorching. Cook for two hours or until chowder is brought to desired
thickness.

If a crockpot, or small steam kettle is available, it is recommended.
Also, clam juice can be added to thin chowder down if it gets too
thick.

Note:  This soup is the BEST clam chowder I have ever tasted! It is
thick and very rich and fattening! I didn't use the clam base since I
don't even know what that is. Also, I didn't need to simmer it as
long as suggested. I cooked it for about 1 1/2 hours. The chowder
needs to be stirred OFTEN, probably about every 5-10 minutes or so or
it will stick to the bottom of the pot.  Also, I one-and-one-halved
times'd it, using about 3 lbs. of chopped clams instead of the
recommended amount.  I also served it with the little soup "clam"
crackers. It made about 5 quarts this way. Deb C.

Cockle Chowder

seafood, soups, british

4 pint cockles, well washed
4 slice bacon, chopped
1 oz butter
1  spanish onion, chopped
3  floury potatoes, cubed
3/4 pint milk
4 tablespoon chopped parsley
1  freshly ground pepper

Take a large pan with a lid and put a little water in it to boil. When
boiling, toss in the cockles, clap the lid on and cook 5 mins or so,
shaking to cook the cockles evenly. When they have all opened, tip
into a colander over a bowl. Remove cockles forthwith from their
shells, and spread out to cool quickly. Strain the liquor carefully
to remove and sand.

Meanwhile parboil the potatoes for about 10 minutes, and in another
pan, melt the butter, let the bacon sizzle in it a moment or two, add
the finely chopped onion, put the lid on and sweat till the onion
becomes transparent. Add the milk, cockle liquor, potatoes and bring
to the boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook very gently till the
potatoes are soft but not a total mush. If you cook too quickly, or
the potatoes are not properly parcooked, the milk will curdle. It
isn't serious, just less attractive.

Chop the cockles roughly, add them to the soup, pepper it and add the
parsley. Taste for saltiness, (it shouldn't need any as the bacon and
cockles are both naturally salty.

Serve with ships biscuits, which you can break into the chowder. Water
biscuits or crackers will substitute.

Coconut Chicken Soup

soups, thai

1 can coconut milk
4 cup chicken stock
1 medium chicken
1 cup whipping cream
4 slice galangal
1  lime or lemon
1 pinch of chili powder
1  salt

A very simple one...

Heat stock and add galangal, chili, whipping cream and coconut milk.
Cut chicken up into bite size pieces. As soon as the mixture begins
to boil, add the chicken pieces and squeeze in the lemon or lime
juice and salt to taste.  The trick is to add the chicken right when
the mixture starts to boil.  Don't let the milk really boil. Cook the
chicken for a very short time, about half a minute.

Serves 6.

NOTE:  I must admit that when I typed this recipe, I missed the
amount of coconut milk to use.  The one can is a guess++that's how
much I would use, at least on the first try.

Cold Buttermilk Soup (Kaernemaelkskoldskall)

soups, danish

4 cup buttermilk
2  eggs
4 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  juice of 1 lemon

Grabbed a little Danish cookbook at a sale this weekend. After going
through it I've decided that the Danes could give the Japanese a run
for their money as far as strange and wonderful edibles go. They
depend heavily on fish and even have a version of sushi that I'll go
into in some detail later in the packet. There is also a hitherto
unsuspected connection between Danish food and Mexican food.  It's
really interesting to see how all these dishes from various countries
inter-link.

I ran across this early on in the Danish book and it raised my
eyebrows enough to keep me going...

Beat the eggs, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla together in the bowl
the soup is to be served in.  Beat the buttermilk and fold in a
little at a time.

If you want to make something out of this dish, top the bowl with a
cup of whipped cream.  Small cakes of oat meal, fried in butter and
sugar, pressed into moistened eggs cups and turned onto a plate, are
served with this dish.

It can also be served after the main course with whipped cream,
meringue and sweetened fruit.

Cold Cherry Soup

fruits, soups, alcohol

2 1/2 cup ; water
3/4 cup superfine sugar
1  3-1/2 inch cinnamon stick
4 cup sour cherries; pitted or
2 can water-packed sour cherries; drained*
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoon ; water
1/3 cup dry red wine
1/3 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup cherry heering; chilled **
1  mint sprigs
1  sour cream (optional)

*Fresh cherries are a lot of work but really do taste better than the
canned variety.  **Other cherry flavored liqueur can be used such as
Cherry Brandy but Cherry Heering works the best.

Bring water, sugar, cinnamon stick and cherries to a boil. Simmmer 30
minutes if using fresh cherries, 10 if using canned. Mix together
cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water, stir into cherries and cook and
stir until clear and slightly thickened.  Remove about 1 cup of
cherries and some juice; puree in blender and return to rest of soup.
Cool, add wine and cream, blend well and chill thoroughly. Just
before serving add Cherry Heering or other type of cherry liqueur.
Serve in chilled bowls garnished with mint and dollops of sour cream.

Cold Chicken~ Celery & Walnut Soup

soups

2  chicken legs
2  onions, peeled
1  carrot, peeled
6  black peppercorns
1 1/2 liter water ( 2 1/2 pints)
2  heads celery, washed
3 tablespoon olive oil
5  cloves garlic, peeled
200 gm shelled walnuts (7 oz)
2 tablespoon yoghurt
1  sea salt
1  black pepper, freshly ground

Remove ALL skin and fat from the chicken legs, place them in a
saucepan with one of the onions, the carrot, the peppercorns and a
large pinch of sea salt, cover with the water, bring to the boil and
simmer for 40-45 minutes.

Halfway through this time, chop up the remaining onion and the celery
and put them to soften in the olive oil in a heavy, covered pan. When
they are soft and the chicken is cooked through, strain nearly all
the stock from round the chicken over the onion and celery and
continue simmering for another 15-20 minutes.

Strip the chicken meat from the bones and cover it with one spoonful
or so of stock to keep it moist. Discard the bones and the carrot and
the whole onion from the stock.

In a large mortar crush the garlic with a little sea salt. Pound the
walnuts into this until they are quite fine (*). Then pound in the
chicken meat, which should be quite soft. Bind this mixture with the
yoghurt, season it with pepper, liquidize the celery soup and stir
the chicken and nut mixture in.

Chill before eating (**).

(*) You can crush the walnuts in an electric blender first; but do
not add the garlic, as the blender would have a brutalizing effect on
its taste.

(**) This soup is best eaten cold, but is also good warm !

2  peeled stalks of broccoli or 1c flo; rets, chopped
1  dried onion
1  veg bouillon
      ----OR----
2  carrots, chopped
1/4 teaspoon curry powder
      ----OR----

1 pkg frozen spinach or kale
1  grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice

1/8 teaspoon each of ginger and pepper

1/2 teaspoon italian herb mixture

Simmer the soup until the veggies are tender.  Puree in blender or

Sally's notes:  Instead of stock of bouillon cubes, you can take out
1/2c soup after pureeing and dissolve a T of miso in it, then return
it to the pot and mix.
Almost all the combos are good with the addition of 1/2 an onion and a
clove or two of garlic sauteed in sherry. Other possible additions
(not combined of course) include: 1T tomato paste, 1/2c leftover
beans or grains, a few dried mushrooms or dried tomatoes, a few
tablespoons of sauerkraut, a T of capers or chopped pickle added
before serving, toasted pumpkin/squash seeds or wheat germ sprinkled
on top.

Congee (Jook) - Rice Gruel

chinese, soups

1 cup long grain rice
3 quart stock (eg chicken)
2 tablespoon chinese preserved turnip; minced
1 slice ginger root; minced
1  piece tangerine peel; soaked to soften, minced
1  salt
      ----GARNISH----
1  chopped green onion
1  chopped coriander
1  slivered preserved ginger
1  sliced tea melon

In all my years of eating and cooking Chinese food, I'd never tried
Congee (rice gruel) before yesterday. It just seemed so *bland* that
I thought it couldn't possibly be all that interesting. I was WRONG!
The recipe below gives a subtle but hearty "soup" which can be
garnished in a virtually infinite number of ways according to
personal taste. I found that I like just the basic stuff,
unembellished the best. I substituted half a cup of long grain rice
and half a cup of glutinous rice for the long grain rice and it
worked very well. The preserved turnip seems to be used mostly for
its salt content. I found it unnecessary to add any more salt to the
congee. The tangerine peel gives a very subtle, nice hint of exotic
perfume to the dish. The pot I made set up almost like a pea soup
when it cooled. Good stuff! Ridiculously easy too...

Congee (Jook)

Combine rice, stock, preserved turnip, ginger and tangerine peel in a
large soup pot and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, uncovered
approximately 1-1 1/2 hours or until the rice is thoroughly broken
up. Stir occasionally to prevent soup from sticking and add boiling
water if necessary. When done, soup should be thick and creamy. Add
salt to taste and garnish with any or all of the suggested garnishes.

Variations: Just before serving, add cooked chicken, pork, ham or
beef. Or with rice add diced forest mushrooms, soaked to soften or
dried shrimp.

Consomme Celestine

crepes, mine

4 cup chicken broth
1/2  chicken breast
5  crepes
1  spinach leaves; fresh or
1  green beans; slivered

If using homemade chicken broth, clarify (whip ine egg white with its
broken shell, add it to boiling broth; continue to boil for 10
minutes, then strain through cheesecloth).  Cut cooked crepes (any
main course will do) into long thin strips.  This is a good way to
use misshapen crepes. Cut uncooked breast of chicken into match-stick
strips and cook for 2 or 3 minutes in the simmering broth.  Then add
crepes and finally the raw spinach or slivered green beans.  Cook 1
minute more.  Check for seasoning and serve.

Corn & Sausage Chowder

soups

1  polish sausage, sliced thinly
6 slice bacon, chopped
1 cup onions, chopped
1/4 cup flour
2 cup chicken stock
1 cup water
4 cup corn
2 cup potatoes, cubed (about 1/4)
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1  red pepper sauce
2 cup milk
2 tablespoon butter

In a big saucepan, brown the sausage and bacon until bacon is crispy.
Remove sausage and bacon with a slotted spoon, and drain on a paper
towel. Discard most of the fat; leave enough to cook the onion. Saute
onion in reserved fat until tender, about 5 minutes.

Gradually stir in the flour.  Add stock and water, stirring
constantly. Add sausage, bacon, corn, potatoes and white pepper. Add
red pepper sauce to taste.  Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer,
covered, for 15 to 20 minutes.  Stir occasionally.

Add milk and cook until soup is heated through and potatoes are
tender. Top with butter and serve.

NOTES:

*  A rich creamy chowder with corn and sausages -- This chowder is a
variation on a family recipe from an old roommate of mine. (She makes
it without the sausage, and with more water). It goes very well with
most seafood.  I am especially fond of it served with crab cakes.
Yield: Serves 6-8.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.

soups, vegetables

1 tablespoon butter
2  onions, chopped

3/4 teaspoon dried sage, crumbled
4 cup corn kernels
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cup chicken stock

1  sweet red pepper, roasted, peeled a; nd seeded
2 tablespoon milk
1 teaspoon jalapeno pepper, minced, or  pinch; cayenne
1/2 teaspoon salt

softened. Stir in corn; cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Remove 1 cup;
set aside.

bring to boil, stirring frequently; reduce heat to low and simmer for
about 5 minutes or until thickened. In food processor or blender,
pure soup, in batches if necessary; returning to saucepan. Stir in
reserved corn mixture, milk and salt; heat through but do not boil.

Red Pepper Sauce: Meanwhile, in blender, pure red pepper, milk,
jalapeno, salt and pepper. Using spoon, attractively swirl about 2 tb
into each soup-bowlful.

Roasted Peppers: To roast sweet red peppers, grill or broil over
medium-high heat, turning often, until peppers are puffed and charred
all over. Or roast in 375F 190C oven for 30 minutes or until browned.
Let cool; peel and seed.

Country Style Cream Soup

soup/stew

3 cup onion, chopped
2/3 cup unsalted butter
3  garlic cloves, minced
2/3 cup flour
8 cup milk
3  egg yolks
1 cup whipping cream (or 1/2-1/2)
1 teaspoon chervil, dried
1 teaspoon basil, dried
1 teaspoon tarragon, dried
3 tablespoon parsley, chopped fresh

Nutmeg, salt, white pepper Saute onion in butter in heavy skillet
until onions become soft and transparent, then add garlic and cook a
few minutes more. Stir in the flour and cook for about 3 minutes
more--careful not to scorch!  Pour the milk in and immediately wisk
to blend. Add the herbs and bring to boil stirring to avoid lumps.
Simmer for at least 15 minutes.  Season to taste with nutmeg, salt,
pepper. Before serving, whisk the egg yolks into the cream then whisk
the mixture into the soup. You can substitute milk for the cream if
you want a lighter soup. * This soup is an excellent base for a wide
variety of soups. I like to add fresh herbs and sometimes some cheese
to the soup. Chopped ham, turkey, or chicken (leftovers), or any
diced begetables can make an even meatier soup. If you add pureed
vegetables you might want to reduce the amount of flour to keep the
soup from getting too thick. * You can saute chopped vegetables
separately and add right after the milk is poured in for wonderful
vegetable cream soups.  Cabbage and Brussels Sprouts are two that
work particularly well. * The original of this recipe is from
Francois Kissel who had the Brasserie Pittsbourg in Seattle--an
outstanding restaurant!

In a large saucepan place all of the ingredients. Bring the liquid to
a boil and then simmer it for 30 minutes. Let it cool. Chef Tim Owen

Foods that are cooked in the liquid will absorb the flavor of the
ingredients in the bouillon."

Crackling Rice Soup

chinese

1/2 cup rice -- raw
1 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon peanut oil
1 1/2 quart chicken broth
2/3 cup baked ham -- slivered
1/3 cup green onions -- chopped
1  soy sauce

Recipe By     : California Cooks! by McDermott and Marks
Serving Size  : 6    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chinese                          Soups

Combine rice, water and salt in a small saucepan. Heat to boiling;
cover and simmer 25 mins. Cool. Toss cooled rice with peanut oil in a
large skillet until rice turns golden brown. Keep hot until ready to
serve. Meanwhile heat together chicken broth, ham and green onions.
turn into large soup tureen. Serve soup at the table topping each
bowl with a spoonful or two of hot rice which crackles as it goes
into the soup. Pass soy sauce, adding individually to taste. Makes 6
servings.

NOTES : According to legend; once, when a beginning Chinese cook once
over cooked a pot of rice, he tasted the scorched crust and found it
good. A rice crust, deep fat fried, is dropped crackling hot into
this novel soup in restaurants. This is a home-grown version.

Crackling Rice Vegetable Soup

chinese, rice, soups, vegetarian

2 cup cooked rice
1 cup deep-frying oil
1 cup dried soybeans
8  nami black mushrooms
1 medium onion, quartered
10 cup cold water
2 teaspoon thin soy
2 tablespoon sherry
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon msg (opt)
1  clove garlic
10  fresh snowpeas
1 large carrot

Rice Cakes:  Work with cooked leftover rice that is slightly moist and
sticky.  If too dry, reheat with sprinkling of water until sticky.
Spread rice in frying pan or pie tin, 1/2" thick. Pack rice into firm
cake: this is important to make sure rice holds together. Place in
oven on low heat, and dry to slightly brittle texture; break into
pieces. Ten minutes before combining with soup, deep-fry rice pieces
until lightly brown. Strain, place in soup tureen, and keep hot in
oven. Avoid holding fried pieces more than 10 minutes, as they tend
to acquire a rancid taste and become overly dry.

Vegetarian Soup:  Wash, then soak soybeans overnight in enough water
to cover.  Wash and soak Nami mushrooms in 1 cup warm water for 1
hour. When mushrooms are soft, separate caps from stems.  In large
soup pot, combine water, beans, mushrooms (and stems), onion and
garlic. Bring to boil, lower heat, and simmer 2 hours. Strain and
reserve stock until ready to finish. Save mushroom caps and 1/2 of
beans for soup.

To finish soup, thinly slice mushroom caps, combine with strained
stock, cooked soybeans, soy sauce, sherry, sesame oil, salt and
sugar. Peel carrot and make thin flower slices (or use flower
cutter); add to soup. Bring soup to just under the boil.  Add MSG and
snowpeas. Cook for 2 minutes.

To serve, seat your diners, place soup tureen of freshly fried, hot
rice pieces on table and pour hot soup over them. If rice and soup
are very hot, rice will sizzle and crackle to everyone's joy and
amusement!

Crawfish & Corn Soup

soups, crawfish

1 lb crawfish tails - peeled
2 cup corn - cut from the cob, reserving; about 4 cobs
1 can corn - cream-style
1 cup onions - finely chopped
2  ribs celery - finely chopped
1  med. bell pepper - finely chopped
1 bunch green onions - finely chopped (use; about 2 or 3
1  of the fresh green part)
4 tablespoon parsley - minced
3  clove garlic - minced (3 or 4 clove; s, depending on size)
6 tablespoon butter
6 tablespoon flour
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1 lb tomatoes - canned, drained (reserve; liquid)
1  bay leaf - or 2
1 teaspoon thyme
1  salt, pepper and tabasco to taste
1  stock:
1  shells and claws for peeled crawish; , not the heads
4 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup brandy - or cognac
1 cup white wine
1  water
1  carrot - cut into large pieces
1  rib celery - cut into large pieces
3  green onions - cut into large piece; s
3  sprig parsley - whole
2  clove garlic
1  bay leaf
1 pinch thyme

Number of Servings:   8

Make stock first.  Ten pounds of boiled crawfish make one pound of
meat. Peel crawfish, reserving shells and claws. Rinse shells and let
drain. Melt butter in a large pot; add shells and fry until sizzling
and hot, turning them often.  When shells are hot enough, heat a
small pot, pour in brandy and ignite.  Remove shells from fire, pour
in brandy, tossing and turning until the flame dies down.

Add wine and water to cover shells.  Add onion, celery, green onions,
parsley, garlic, thyme and bay leaf. Let it all simmer for an hour.
Strain carefully and reserve.

In another pot, melt butter, add flour and let cook on low fire until
medium brown.  Add chopped vegetables and let cook on a low fire until
wilted, stirring often. Chop tomatoes and add to pot with reserved
liquid. Let cook a few minutes.

Add stock -- just enough to make a soupy consistency ~- then add
Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, thyme, crawfish, corn and about four
of the cobs (for added flavor). Let simmer an hour. Taste for salt,
pepper and Tabasco.  If using boiled crawfish, it is usually peppery
enough.

Remove the cobs and serve.

If the soup is too thick, add more stock or water.  If it's too thin,
cook a little more flour and add to thicken it.

Serves 8.

NOTE:  If you prefer to buy crawfish tails already picked, buy a
couple of pounds of boiled crawfish and pick them so as to have the
shells to make your stock. Shrimp may be substituted.

1  (2-3 leeks)
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1  garlic clove -- peeled &
1  mince
3 tablespoon fresh basil -- chopped
1  freshly ground black pepper
1  to taste

Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Dissolve the bouillon cube in the boiling water. Add the broccoli and
cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until it is bright green and fork tender.

Put the evaporated milk in a small saucepan.  Warm over low heat, just
until bubbles begin to form around the edge. Remove the pan from the
heat.

Preheat a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat for about 1 minute.
Spray it twice with the vegetable oil. Add the leeks and saute,
stirring often, for 7 to 8 minutes, until limp. Stir in the flour and
cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the warm evaporated milk. Continue to
cook, whisking constantly, until the flour has dissolved and the
mixture is smooth.

Reduce the heat to low.  Add the nutmeg, the garlic, and the broccoli,
along with its cooking liquid. Simmer for 5 minutes more, taking care
not to bring the soup to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and
stir in the basil and black pepper.

Cream Of Cauliflower Soup (Veloute De Chor-Fl

soups

1 small head cauliflower
1  salt
1 large leek, white part only
1  fresh ground white pepper
2 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup creme fraiche
2 tablespoon flower
1 cup croutons
3 1/2 cup boiling water

Blanch the cauliflower:  break the head into flowerets and put them
in a saucepan with cold water to cover. Bring it to the boiling
point, cook for one minute, drain, and rinse the flowerets under cold
running water.

Wash the leek, slice it into small rounds, and cook them in the butter
until they are soft.  Stir in the flower, cook for a few minutes
until it is golden, and add the boiling water. Add the blanched
cauliflower, season to taste with salt and pepper, and simmer for
20    minutes.

Strain the soup through a food mill or puree it in a blender. Stir in
the creame fraiche, correct the seasoning, and serve with croutons.

CREME FRAICHE: American heavy cream is considerably thinner than
French heavy cream.

Use 1 teaspoon of buttermilk for each cup of heavy cream. Heat in a
saucepan until it is lukewarm (about 85 F), pour into a glass
container, and allow it to stand at room temperature until it
thickens. In very hot weather it can thicken in as little as 6 hours;
in cold weather it can take as long as 36 hours.  This can be stored
in the refrigerator for a least a week.

Cream Of Chicken Soup Supreme

poultry, soups

1  stewing chicken, cut up
2 lb veal knuckle (have butcher crack it; into 4 or f
1  pieces )
2 tablespoon butter
2  carrots, scrubbed and scraped, cut; into 1/4 -inch pieces
1/4 cup chopped parsley
3/4 cup diced celery
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 small onion, diced
10 cup cold water
1 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoon instant flour
3  egg yolks. beaten until lemon yello; w
1/2 teaspoon salt
2  drops tabasco (optional)

Place the chickeo, veal knuckle and butter in a large soup kettle.
Lightly brown the outside of the chicken in the butter and the fat
that wiil gather from the chicken and veal knuckle Then add the
carrots, parsley, celery, pepper, onion and cold water. Continue to
cook until it starts to boil. Remove all surplus fat and froth that
may gather on the top. Turn the heat down and continue to simmer for
2 to 3 hours, or until a fork can be twisted in the meat of the
chicken breast.

Remove the chichen and veal bones from the soup. Set them aside to
cool. Strain the soup through a fine sieve and set it aside to cool.
As soon as it is cooled, carefully remove all of the fat from the
surface. Then return the soup to the stove and bring to a simmer
again. Remove all the meat from the chicken bones. Discard all the
skin and vegetable pieces, for you have already extracted all of the
good in them.

Beat the cream, flour and eggs together until all are smoothly
blended. Add the salt to the simmering soup and mix well. Take about
1/2 cup of the hot simmering soup and beat it into the egg and cream
mixture. Then slowly add the egg cream mxture to tbe soup, stirring
all the while. Continue to cook over low heat for a few minutes
longer, until the soup has thickened and lightly coats tbe spoon. At
this point add the Tabasco if you like this sharpness in creamed
soups. Serve piping hot with saltines.

Serves 6 generously.

Cream Of Chicken Soup With Wild Rice

soups

1 1/3 cup (8 oz) uncooked wild rice
3 lb broiler-fryer chicken, cut up
7 cup water
12 oz sliced mushrooms
2 tablespoon cooking oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
2 tablespoon instant chicken bouillon granules
3/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup flour
4 cup milk
3/4 cup dry white wine

Cook wild rice according to pkg. directions for 30 minutes; drain off
liquid and rinse. Set partially cooked rice aside.

In a large Dutch oven or stockpot, combine the chicken and water and
bring to boiling. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes
or until chicken is tender. Remove chicken from broth and let stand
until cool enough to handle. Skim fat from broth. Strain and reserve
broth. Remove chicken meat from bones. Cut into bite-size pieces.

In the same pot, cook mushrooms in hot oil for 4 to 5 minutes or until
tender.

Add onion and celery.  Cover and cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until
tender, stirring once (I'd probably do the onion and celery first,
until transluscent, and then add mushrooms and cover and cook).
Remove from heat. Return broth to the stock pot.

Add partially cooked wild rice to the chicken broth. Stir in the
granules, white pepper and salt.  Bring to boiling and then reduce
heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.

In a large saucepan, melt the butter and stir in the flour until
smooth. Add milk all at once. Cook and stir until bubbly. Stir into
soup mixture. Stir in the chicken pieces and wine, and heat through.

Cream Of Eggplant Soup

soups, vegetables

1 lb eggplant
1  salt
2 oz butter
1 medium onion, finely diced
2  stalks celery, diced
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 pinch thyme
1 pinch basil
4 cup chicken stock
1 cup potato, diced
1/2 cup cream

Salt Pepper Diced tomato, for garnish Chopped chives, for garnish

Dice the eggplant but do not peel.  Sprinkle a little salt over the
eggplant and leave to stand for about 30 minutes. Put in a strainer
and run a little water over the dice, pat dry. This removes any
bitter taste which would spoil the soup.

Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the onion, celery and eggplant.
Saute', stirring occasionally until the vegetables have slightly
softened. Eggplant absorbs butter very rapidly so you may have to add
a little more or the vegetables will stick.

Add the curry powder and fry to release the flavors. Add thyme, basil,
chicken stock and the potato.  Cover and simmer until the vegetables
are quite soft, about
30    minutes.

Put the soup through a sieve or moulin and add the cream. Taste for
seasoning.  Add a little diced tomato or chopped chives for garnish
and color.

This soup keeps well for several days.  However, if you intend making
it beforehand and keeping it, only add the cream when you reheat it.
It thickens as it stands, but it can be thinned with a little milk.

Cream Of Mushroom Soup (Lie)

soups

1 lb mushrooms,rinsed & drained
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1  large onion,chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
6 cup chicken broth,reg-strength
1  dried bay leaf
1 cup whipping cream
3 tablespoon dry sherry
1  salt
1  pepper

Mushroom soup is so readily available in cans that it seldom occurs
to the cook to make it from scratch. The canned product is, in fact,
so universal, reliable, and chameleon-like in flavor that it has
become the base of a thousand casseroles.
If you seek a more intense mushroom flavor, however, look no further.
Erid Lie, tooting his own horn, claims to have the answer to your
prayers right here.
Flour plays a part in the thickening of this soup, but the basic body
and emphatic statement of mushroom flavor come from cooking part of
the mushrooms with onions until they are mellow and lightly browned,
then pureeing them.
The flavor is further enhanced by adding sliced mushrooms before the
final heating.


1. Chop half the mushrooms; thinly slice the remaining mushrooms and
set aside.
2. Melt butter in a 5-6 quart pan over medium-high heat; add chopped
mushrooms, onion, and thyme. Stir often until the vegetables are
lightly browned, 15-20 minutes. Mix flour with vegetables.
3. Pour into a blender or food processor; whirl, adding as much broth
as needed to get the mixture smoothly pureed. Pour mixture back into
pan; add remaining broth, sliced mushrooms, bay leaf, and cream.
4. Bring soup to a boil on high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce
heat to low and simmer to blend flavors, about 10 minutes. Add
sherry, salt, and pepper to taste. Make about 8 cups.

1  to 2 small potatoes, baked, skins r; emoved

Finalist in 1986 Recipe Contest: PATTY FILICE, Gilroy, CA

Some of the best garlic recipes come right from Gilroy. Here's one-a
rich, filling soup that would go well with a light seafood or poultry
entree.

Place garlic heads on cookie sheet, sprinkle with olive oil and bake
in 350-degree oven for 1 hour. Let cool. Cut off end of each clove
and squeeze out contents. (Garlic will be soft and creamy.) Set
aside. Saute chopped onion in butter until softened. Add buttermilk
and cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour mixture into a food
processor. Rice potato and add with garlic to onion and buttermilk
mixture. Puree until smooth. Return mixture to saute pan. Add cognac,
dill and salt. Heat thoroughly. If soup is too thin, add additional
potato. If soup is too thick, add addi- tional buttermilk. Serve
immediately, garnished with additional dill and croutons. Makes 4
servings.

Cream Of Salsify & Mushroom Soup

soups

450 gm salsify ( 1 lb)
2  onions, chopped
3 tablespoon sunflower oil
275 gm mushrooms (9 2/3 oz), - cleaned and; roughly - chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 liter water (2 1/8 pints)
25 gm butter (1 oz)
25 gm flour (1 oz)
1 1/2 deciliter milk (1/4 pint)
1  sea salt
1  black pepper, freshly ground

Scrub the salsify in plenty of water, discard the ends of the roots
and cut into 1 cm (1/2 in) lengths. Soften the onions with the
salsify in the sunflower oil for 10 ... 15 minutes in a heavy,
covered pan. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking, as salsify is
dry. Meanwhile stew the mushrooms in the olive oil until they have
given off their liquid, reserve the liquid and add the mushrooms to
the salsify and onions. Cover with the water and bring to the boil;
simmer for 20 minutes. In a heavy pan, melt the butter, stir in the
flour and gradually add first the mushrooms-liquid, then the milk.
When you have a thick sauce, slowly stir in the liquid from the soup,
add the vegetables and liquidize. Season with salt and pepper to
taste. (Salsify is a long, thin, darkly earth-coloured root, can be
found in greengrocers's shops in February, also available as
preserved ; when scrubbed, it is revealed to be white whithout an
obvious outer skin. Also known as "vegetable oysters" ~ some
curiously salt, fishy flavour - or as "poor people's asparagus")

Cream Of Tomato Soup

soups, vegetables, british

1 kg ripe tomatoes
100 gm chopped onions
125 gm chopped young carrots
1  bouquet garni
1 liter stock
1  salt, pepper
300 ml cream
1  chopped chives or basil

Simmer the vegetables and bouquet with 3/4 of the stock until they are
tender. Remove the bouquet garni and pure the soup in the blender or
sieve until it is very smooth. Taste, add seasoning and remaining
stock. If it is to be served cold, stir in the cream and chill. If it
is to be served hot, bring the cream to the boil in a clean pan and
add the soup gradually. In both cases serve sprinkled with chives or
better, chopped basil. If you like a spicy flavour, add nutmeg to the
soup as it cooks and sprinkle a little on top when it is served.

Modifications for sterilising

Do not season. Blend the soup, then sieve. Pour into 1l strilising
jars, and seal and sterilise in the usual way. When reheating, season
then bring 200ml cream to the boil and pour in the boiling soup
gradually. You may have to reblend to cure possible curdling.

2 tablespoon reduced-fat chicken broth
1  sweet red pepper, finely
1  diced
3  scallions, minced
1  shallot, minced
1 tablespoon unbleached flour
2 cup corn
1 3/4 cup skim milk

are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Add a bit of water, if necessary,
to prevent scorching.  Stir in the flour and cook until slightly
thickened, 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and
set aside. Place 1 cup of the corn in a blender or food processor
with 1 cup of the milk. Process on low until smooth. Add the
corn-milk mixture, the remaining corn, the remaining milk, nutmeg and
soy sauce to the peppers in the pot. Set over medium heat and bring
the mixture just to boiling, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and
simmer for about 5 minutes. Garnish with the red peppers and parsley.

Creating Instant Stews

stews, information

1  no ingredients

Selecting the trimmest, fastest-cooking ingredients is the basis for
instant stews. But the key to creating such a stew is in the assembly
of those ingredients.
There are five simple steps to cooking an instant stew in your home
kitchen: Step 1. In a soup pot, bring broth to a boil over medium-high
heat. Step 2.  Add tender, lean, skinless poultry or fish that's been
cut into small pieces. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer
for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove and reserve the meat. Step 3.  Add hard,
long-cooking fresh foods like potatoes, carrots or winter squash and
dried foods like lentils, uncooked white rice and grains, as well as
any dried herbs or spices. Stir, cover and simmer for 5 to 10
minutes. Step4. Add dried food, such as various kinds of pasta and
quick rice (which have shorter cooking times that those mentioned in
Step 3), canned beans, frozen vegetables, tender fresh vegetables and
aromatics like garlic or onions. Bring to a boil. Stir, cover and
cook for 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 5.  Return cooked poultry or fish to the pot. Add fresh snipped
herbs, fresh pasta or fresh greens, like spinach or kale. Stir, cover
and simmer for 5 minutes. Serve the stew immediately.

Creme Constance

french, soups, starters, dairy

1 1/2 oz butter
1 1/2 oz onion; finely chopped
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 oz flour
15 fl oz milk
15 fl oz chicken stock
5 tablespoon coconut milk
1  salt & pepper
      ----TO FINISH----
4 tablespoon cream
4 slice lemon

"Despite the simplicity of this recipe, it is delightful and subtle,
although this depends very much upon the quality of the basic
ingredients used." IMH
Melt butter, and soften the very finely chopped onion over gentle
heat. When tender, but not browned, add curry powder (which should be
of good quality, and ideally home made) and continue cooking 1-2
mins. Stir in flour and cook to make a roux for a further minute or
so. :    Remove from heat and when slightly cooled, gradually stir in
stock and milk. Return to heat and stir while bringing to the boil.
When boiling, reduce heat and simmer gently 15 minutes or so.
Add coconut milk (or creamed coconut if the milk is unavailable)
and stir to incorporate. Strain, correct seasoning and reheat. Serve
with a little cream marbled on the surface, and a slice of lemon.

Creole Chicken Soup

cajun, diet

1/2 cup onion - chopped
1/4 cup celery - chopped
1  garlic clove - minced
3 cup water or chicken stock (fat
1  removed)
1 cup tomato - chopped
6 oz chicken meat - lean, cooked
1  or raw
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon marjoram
2  bay leaves
1  black pepper - freshly
1  ground, to taste

Cook the onion, celery, and garlic over high heat for 2 minutes,
stirring constantly until they begin to colour.

Add all remaining ingredients

Cover the pot and simmer gently for 30 minutes.

To Serve:
Ladle into warm soup bowls and serve piping hot.

NOTES:
This is a very simple and basic preparation, and an excellent way to
create a thrifty meal or first course from small amounts of leftover
poultry.  It can, of course, be made from scratch by simply using
uncooked poultry meat.  I prefer to cut leftover bird parts into
pieces with the bone still in and add them to the pot.  However, this
does require the sometimes inelegant exercise of dealing with the
bones as you eat.

Variations:
Any poultry can be used, from chicken or turkey to Cornish hen or
squab, and from wild duck, or poule d'eau, to snipe, quail, or
pheasant.  The meat of the bird can be cooked or raw.  I like to add
pieces of bird meat leftover from one of my smoked chickens.

A tablespoon of blond "roux" mixed with some of the stock and stirred
into the soup a few minutes before the simmering is complete adds a
silky texture to the dish.
