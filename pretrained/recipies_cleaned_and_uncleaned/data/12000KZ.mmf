      Title: PARTY RYE
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Hot sausage
      1    Onion (chopped)
      1 lb Mild sausage
      1 ts Italian seasoning
      2 lb Velvetta cheese
      2    Loaves party rye
 
  Cook sausage and onions, stirring often.  This keeps the sausage in
  small chunks.  (I like to fry the sausage in water because that helps
  drain off more of the fat.) Add cheese and seasoning and heat until
  cheese is melted. Put bread slices on a cookie sheet and spread the
  mixture over the bread. Freeze until ready to serve. When ready to
  serve, remove from the freezer and bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.
  
  (One loaf of Rye bread makes forty slices)

      Title: PARTY SUSHI ROLLS
 Categories: Japanese, Appetizers, Diabetic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  White, Short-Grain Rice,
           -preferably Japanese
      3 c  Water (or according to rice
           -package directions)
  3 1/2 tb Rice Vinegar -or- White
           -Vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
 
  Sushi, a representative food of Japan, is a vinegared rice garnished
  with an assortment of fresh vegetables, fish and seasonings. You'll
  find many of the ingredients ... and the bamboo mat ... at an
  Oriental food store.
  
  RICE:
  
  Cook rice in water for about 25 minutes or until all the liquid is
  absorbed. Spread rice evenly over bottom of a large glass or wooden
  bowl.
  
  Mix vinegar, sugar and salt together in a small bowl.
  
  Sprinkle vinegar mixture generously over the rice. You may not need
  all the vinegar mixture. The rice should remain somewhat dry.
  
  With a large wooden spoon, mix rice with a slicing motion.
  
  Leave the rice in the bowl, covered with a damp cloth.
  
  ROLLS:
  
  1 pk Nori Seaweed, large or medium (Quality nori seaweed must be
  crisp. Look for a well-sealed package.) 1 Bamboo Mat, medium or
  large, for rolling sushi
  
  FILLINGS ... Chose from these combinations:
  
  1    Cucumber, cut into thin strips the same length as seaweed 1
  Avocado, peeled, pitted and cut into thin strips Fresh Cilantro,
  minced
  
  2 oz Daikon Radish, cut into strips 2 oz Pickled Ginger 4 oz Small
  Shrimp, cooked
  
  4 oz Prosciutto 1 Cucumber, cut into thin strips 1 Avocado, peeled,
  pitted and cut into thin strips 2 oz Pickled Ginger
  
  TO ASSEMBLE SUSHI ROLLS:
  
  Place one sheet of nori seaweed on the bamboo mat.
  
  Spread approximately 3/4 cup rice onto seaweed; flatten with the back
  of a spoon.  Leave uncovered 3/8 inch (1 cm) at front of sheet and
  3/4 inch (2 cm at end of sheet.
  
  Place all filling ingredients at center.
  
  To form roll, lift one end of the mat and begin to roll and compress
  the seaweed.  Use the mat only to help form the roll. (It may be
  difficult at first to keep the mat from rolling with the seaweed.)
  
  Moisten end of seaweed with a small amount of water to seal the roll.
  
  Cut into rounds approximately 1/2 inch thick.

MMMMM------------------SEPHARDIC COOKING; MARK-----------------------
 
  ~-Jewish, Cochin
      1/2 lb Dark raisins
      1/2 lb Date paste
      1/4 c  Almonds, blanched
        2 tb Sesame seeds
        1 c  Sugar
      1/4 c  Wine vinegar
      1/4 ts Salt
        1 c  Water
  
  1.  Into a processor, put all of the ingredients and process together
  into a smooth paste.  Put the paste in a pan and simmer over very low
  heat for 1/2 hour. Cool.
  
  Serve at room temperature with matzoh at the Passover Seders.
  
  NOTE:  The date paste, for those who cannot find it already prepared,
  is nothing more than seedless dates ground to a paste with the
  smallest amount of water. I suggest 1/2 pound of dates and 3
  tablespoons of water, processed together to smoothness.
  
  A sweet and pungent jaroseth is unusual since other cultures do not
  use vinegar and therefore lacks pungency.

    1/4 c  Madeira
    1/2 ts Lemon Rind; Grated
      3 tb Confectioners' Sugar
      1 tb Lemon Juice
      1 tb Rum; Light
 
  *    You can also use Large-Curd Cottage Cheese if the Farmers Cheese
  is ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- NOTE:  THIS IS A SPECIAL CAKE REQUIRING A NEW
  LARGE FLOWER POT 7 X 7-INCHES AT A MINIMUM. Press the cheese through
  a sieve. Combine the cheese with the egg yolks, beating in 1 yolk at
  a time. Add the sugar and blend well. Heat the cream in a large
  saucepan until it almost boils, then add the cheese mixture and cook
  over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens.
  Remove from the heat before it begins to boil. Stir in the fruits,
  almonds, and lemon rind.  Cool.  Cream together the butter and the
  vanilla, then stir into the cooled cheese mixture. Line the flower
  pot with several layers of moistened cheesecloth, leaving enough
  cloth at the top to form a flap that will cover the pot. Fill the pot
  with the cheese mixture and cover with the flap. Put a weight on the
  top and place in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.  The whey (liquid)
  will drip out the bottom of the pot, so be sure to place a pan under
  it. When drained, carefully unmold the cake with a knife.  Remove the
  cheesecloth and smooth the sides with a hot knife.  Prepare the
  sauce. Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, Madeira, and lemon rind in
  the top of a double boiler. Cook and continue beating until the
  mixture thickens.  Stir in the lemon juice and the rum, then chill
  briefly.
   Pour the sauce over the cheesecake and serve. NOTE: This very unusual
  cheesecake is a traditional Russian Easter dish. In the old days, the
  custom was to decorate it with paper flowers or religious emblems and
  have the priest come by and bless it.  Back then, it was made in a
  special pyramid-shaped form, but you can make it in an ordinary red
  clay flower pot.
   Visually, the effect is quite striking, and the drainage hole allows
  the excess whey to escape.  To make paskha, you will need a large
  flower pot and some cheesecloth. The paskha will keep in the
  refrigerator for several weeks, but be sure to make it at least three
  days in advance.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Rich chocolate dessert for Passover.  This is the only Passover
  dessert I've ever tasted that is good enough to be making during the
  rest of the year as well (when you can use corn starch instead of the
  potato starch).
  
  *  If you don't have a springform pan for Passover, use an aluminum
  disposable cake pan and just strip off the sides when the cake has
  cooled.

  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream, chilled
    1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar*****
    1/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa
      2 ts Instant coffee
      1 ts Vanilla***
 
  Grease the bottom of a 15 1/2x10 1/2x1" jelly-roll pan; line with
  waxed paper, grease lightly.   Preheat oven to 375 In a large bowl of
  an electric mixer beat egg whites at high speed until soft peaks form
  when beaters are slowly raised. Add 1/4 cup sugar, 2 T at a time,
  beating until stiff peaks form when beater is slowly raised. With
  same beaters beat yolks at high speed, adding the remaining 1/2 cup
  of sugar 2 T at a time, until mixture is very thick-about 4 minutes.
  At low speed beat in cocoa, vanilla and salt just until >> smooth.
  With wire whisk or rubber scraper using and under and over motion,
  gently fold the cocoa mixture into the beaten egg whites, just until
  they are blended(no egg white should show). Spread evenly in the pan,
  
  Bake 15 minutes, just until the surface springs back when gently
  pressed with fingertip. Sift confectioner's sugar in a 15x10"
  rectangle, on a clean linen towel. Turn cake out onto sugar, lift off
  pan, peel paper off of cake. Roll up cake jelly-roll fashion, towel
  and all, starting at the short end.
  
  Cool completely on rack, seam side down- at least 30 minutes. To make
  the filling: Combine filling ingredients in medium bowl. Beat using
  an electric mixer until thick and then refrigerate. Unroll cake,
  spread with fillin to 1" from the edge, reroll/ Refrigerate 1 hour
  before serving. To serve sprinkle with confectioner's sugar. You may
  make this cake a week ahead, then freeze it wrapped in foil. Let
  stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving.
  
  *** Pure vanilla has alcohol and therefore is not Kosher for Passover.
  Either leave it out or find vanilla without the alcohol. *****
  Confectioner's sugar has cornstarch and so is not Kosher for Passover,
  someone posted a recipe for making confectioner's sugar by using
  potato starch instead of cornstarch. I did not get the exact
  directions, but I think if you backdate you will find it in one of
  the dessert recipes.

      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     10    To 12 eggs
      3 oz Unsweetened chocolate
    1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate pieces
    2/3 c  Sugar
      2 c  Very finely chopped almonds
           -or pecans
    3/4 ts Pure vanilla
    1/4 ts Almond extract
    1/4 c  Sugar
           DARK CHOCOLATE GLAZE:
      1 c  Semisweet chocolate pieces
      1 ts Butter or margarine
    1/2 ts Instant coffee crystals
      1 tb Hot water
      3 tb Dairy sour cream
    1/4 ts Maple flavoring
 
  Servings: 10 to 15
  
  DIRECTIONS: Set a large mixer bowl in a sink filled with 2 inches of
  warm water. Separate eggs (you should have about 1 1/2 cups whites).
  Pour the whites into the warm mixer bowl and place yolks in a smaller
  mixer bowl (or let separated eggs stand, covered, at room temperature
  for 30 minutes).
  
  Meanwhile, in a small, heavy saucepan, partially melt unsweetened
  chocolate and semisweet chocolate pieces over low heat. Turn off heat
  and stir (chocolate will continue to melt).
  
  Cut a waxed paper liner for the bottom of a 10" tube pan, cutting it
  1/2" wider than the pan and the center hole slightly larger than the
  tube. Grease pan thoroughly. Place liner in pan and grease liner.
  
  Beat egg yolks with an electric mixer on high speed for about 4
  minutes or till they're thick and lemon colored. Add the 2/3 cup
  sugar, beating till very thick. Stir in the melted chocolate and
  chopped nuts.
  
  Thoroughly wash and dry beaters. Beat egg whites with vanilla and
  almond extract till foamy. Gradually add the 1/4 cup sugar to egg
  whites, beating till soft peaks form.
  
  Lighten egg yolk mixture with about 2 cups beaten egg whites. Add to
  the remaining egg white mixture and fold together to combine. Turn
  batter into prepared pan.
  
  Bake at 350-F for about 40 minutes or till top springs back when
  lightly touched. Run a knife around the edge of the pan and center to
  loosen. Cool in pan for 1 hour. Invert onto cake plate. Remove waxed
  paper.
  
  Prepare glaze; spread over top and sides of cake.
  
  Dark Chocolate Glaze: In a small heavy saucepan or skillet, melt
  chocolate over low heat. Remove from heat and stir in butter or
  margarine. In a small bowl, dissolve instant coffee in hot water.
  Stir in the sour cream and maple flavoring. Add sour cream mixture to
  chocolate, stirring till smooth and shiny. Makes 3/4 cup.

  1 1/2 c  Farfel
      4    Eggs
           -Salt & Pepper to taste
      1 tb Schmaltz; more or less
 
  Put farfel in colander with bowl underneath and pour boiling water

  and seasonings and schmaltz. Put dab of schmaltz in bottom of muffin
  tin ~ heat pan in oven then take out and fill with mixture. Bake at
  400 for 30 mins. I usually double recipe.
  
  They come out all big and puffy and as they cool they flop. Also be
  careful; the bottom of the oven gets covered with schmaltz. I usually
  make these till the oven starts to smoke - but never have enough.
  They're yummy.

      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Egg whites (about 6) at room
           -temp
      2 ts Lemon juice
    3/4 ts Vanilla
    1/4 ts Almond extract
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  Whipping cream
      2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
      3 c  Red raspberries or one 12 oz
           -pkg frozen, thawed
      1 tb Sugar
           Fresh mint leaves (opt)
 
  Servings: 12 Notes: You can make both the billowy white torte and its
  sauce ahead of time. That's convenient for serving during the seder.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Preheat oven to 450-F. Grease the bottom of a 10" tube
  pan or a 9" springform pan. Set aside.
  
  For torte, in a mixer bowl, beat egg whites, lemon juice, 3/4 tsp
  vanilla and almond extract with an electric mixer on medium speed.
  Beat for about 3 to 4 minutes or till soft peaks form (tips curl).
  
  Gradually beat in the 1 1/4 cups sugar, 1 Tbsp at a time, beating on
  high speed till stiff peaks form (tips stand straight) and sugar is
  almost dissolved (about 10 minutes).
  
  Using a rubber scraper, transfer mixture to prepared pan and smooth
  the top. Scrape around the sides and center post (if using a tube
  pan), leaving a small trench between the meringue and the pan.
  
  Place in preheated oven. Turn off the oven. Let torte dry in oven
  with door closed for at least 8 hours or overnight. If using a tube
  pan, loosen edges and center with a sharp knife. Lift out tube. (Or
  remove sides of springform pan.) Slide knife under meringue. Invert
  onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic wrap and foil; freeze, if
  desired.
  
  About 4 to 8 hours before serving, in a small mixer bowl, beat
  whipping cream till soft peaks form. Add the 2 tsp sugar and 1 tsp
  vanilla; beat till stiff peaks form. Frost the top and sides of the
  torte. Cover and chill till serving time.
  
  For raspberry sauce, in a food processor bowl or blender container,
  combine the raspberries and 1 Tbsp sugar. Cover; process or blend
  till smooth. Strain sauce, if desired.

      4    Egg whites
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Sifted cake meal
    1/4 c  Sifted potato starch
           Superfine sugar
 
  In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with the 1/4 cup of sugar
  until light and creamy.
  
  In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy, then gradually
  add the 1/2 cup sugar beating well after each addition until stiff.
  Fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture.
  
  On a piece of waxed paper sift the cake meal and the potato starch.
  Sprinkle the sifted cake meal and potato starch over the batter and
  fold in gently.
  Line a large cookie sheet with brown paper. Using a pastry bag fitted
  with a round tube, pipe the batter onto the paper to form finger
  shapes about 1" wide and 4" long. Dust with superfine sugar shaken
  through a small sieve.
  
  Bake for 10-12 minutes in a preheated 375 oven. Using a wide spatula,
  loosen from the paper immediately.
  Makes about 24.
  
  I would use these to make several desserts that require either regular
  ladyfingers or I would line a springform pan with these and fill it
  with your favorite mousse recipe. Or you could use them to serve with
  a fruit compote.

  water. Serve with vegetable broth.
  
  This makes very small matzo balls, so plan on 3-4 per serving. Each:

 Categories: Breads, Jewish, Passover
      Yield: 12 Rolls

      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Peanut oil
      4    Eggs
 
  Combine matzah meal with salt and sugar.  In a medium saucepan, bring
  oil and water to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add
  the matzah meal, mixing well.
  
  Beat in the eggs thoroughly, one at a time (this is where it starts
  to get sticky).  Let the mixture stand for about 15 minutes (can be
  refrigerated).
  
  With well-oiled hands, shape it into rolls and place on a well-greased
  cookie sheet (you will have to keep re-oiling your hands). Bake in a
  preheated 375 degree F. oven for 50 minutes or until golden brown.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Bread-like Passover rolls -- This recipe comes from a poster-sized
  sheet of recipes printed by Manischewitz many years ago (probably
  before I was born). Besides making reasonably good mock "rolls," it's
  also great fun for kids to make (very sticky!).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  35 minutes preparation (including waiting), 50 minutes
  baking. : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour, sifted
      3 ea Eggs
 
  Sift flour into a mound on a warm (room-temperature) surface.
  
  Make a fist-size crater in the mound.  Crack the eggs into this
  crater.
  
  Using a fork, beat the eggs until the yokes are broken and mixed.
  Continue beating, gradually adding flour from the sides of the crater
  until the mixture is not runny.
  
  Begin mixing the entire with your bare hands, until the eggs are
  completely mixed in with the flour.  If the ball is still sticky, add
  a small amount of flour.
  
  Wrap the ball tightly in plastic wrap and clean up your work area.
  
  Unwrap the ball and knead the dough:  Push down, away from you with
  the heel of your hands.  Grasp the point of dough furthest from your
  body and fold down towards you. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and
  repeat. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth (about 10-15
  minutes).
  
  Wrap the dough tightly and set aside for 20 minutes.
  
  At this point, the dough is finished.  You may either run it through a
  pasta press, or use a rolling pin to flatten and knife to cut the
  pasta. From: Bryan Hanks

      8 oz Navy beans or

           -an excellent soup if you
           -they are available (check

      3 tb Olive oil
      1 lg Onion; chopped

      3 cl Garlic; chopped
      2 c  Canned Italian plum tomatoes

    1/2 ts Dried oregano
    1/4 ts Dried basil
      8 c  Chicken stock; preferably
           -homemade
      4 tb Italian parsley; chopped
      8 oz Small pasta shells or
           Other small shaped pasta
           Salt to taste; optional
           Freshly ground pepper
           Parmesan cheese; freshly
           -grated (use the best
           -imported Parmesan cheese
           -you can afford, it's worth
           -the cost
 
  Soak beans overnight in water to cover.  Next day drain water and
  rinse beans.
  
  In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat and add the onion,
  celery, and garlic.  Cook and stir gently for 3 minutes or until the
  vegetables are soft and begin to color slightly. Add tomatoes,
  oregano, basil, stock, parsley, and soaked beans.  I usually add 1
  cup of cold water at this point to the bean mixture. Bring to a boil,
  reduce heat, and simmer about 1-1/2 hours or until beans are soft.
  About 30 minutes before soup is done, in a large pot of boiling
  water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain and rinse. Add to the soup
  mixture. Add freshly ground pepper and salt if you so desire. I do
  not cook with salt at all so the soup goes without it. Guests that
  wish a saltier soup can add it at the table. Serve soup with freshly
  grated Parmesan cheese.
  
  This soup is one of our favorites on a cold wintery night, I usually
  serve with a mixed green salad, crusty sourdough bread, a simple
  fruit cup or baked apple for dessert, and of course a good Italian
  Chianti or Barbera Wine.  Serves approximately 6 people.

      Title: PASTA - BASIC RECIPE FOR HOMEMADE
 Categories: Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour;unbleached; up to
           -3 cups
      4    Eggs;slightly beaten
 
  Ricetta Base Per Pasta in Casa (Basic Recipe for Homemade Pasta)
  
  HAND ROLLED: Mound part of the flour in a large board or other working
  surface and make a well at center. Pour in eggs. With the aid of a
  fork, mix eggs and flour very gradually until a soft paste forms.
  With your finger mix in enough flour to make a firm but not too hard,
  dough. Knead for about 5 minutes, till dough is smooth. Place in an
  unfloured dish; cover with an inverted dish and let it rest in the
  refrigerator for about 1/2 hour.
    Take half of the dough, knead it lightly, and shape into a ball.
  Place on a well floured board. With the palms of your hands, flatten
  the ball, keeping the round shape, and sprinkle with flour. With the
  rolling pin, begin to thin the disk out in all directions, trying not
  to lose the round shape. Continue to sprinkle with flour as it
  becomes necessary, so that the dough does not stick to the pin. As
  soon as the disk of dough is thin enough to be rolled AROUND the
  rolling pin do so.* Starting from the end farthest from you, begin to
  roll the dough toward you, using small, even strokes back and forth,
  at the same time you swiftly slide your hands inward to the centre
  and outward to the edges of the pin. When the sheet is all rolled
  around the pin, PUSH the pin away from you at arm's length; then
  vigorously ROLL it back towards you, so that one side of the sheet
  flaps several times over the board. Turn the pin 90 degrees and
  unroll the sheet from it. Repeat from * as many times as needed for
  the desired thinness. Repeat with the other half of the dough and use
  as directed in each individual recipe. SERVES: 6 to 16, depending on
  the different uses made of it WITH A HAND OPERATED MACHINE: Make a
  dough, using the method described above or by mixing eggs and flour
  in bowl. Knead over a well-floured board, mixing until they have a
  very firm dough. There is no need to make it smooth because the
  machine will take care of that. Place in an unfloured dish; cover
  with an inverted dish and let it rest in the refrigerator for about
  1/2 hour.
   Take 1/4th of the dough at a time and begin the thinning. With the
  rollers set at the first slot (farthest apart), feed the dough
  between the rollers while turning the crank. If some of the dough
  sticks to the rollers or to the machine, that means the dough is too
  soft and more flour must be added. Fold and feed with the rollers set
  at the same slot 3 or 4 times, until the sheet comes out in one piece
  (but not too smooth). Move on to the second slot and feed the sheet
  only once. Keeping on moving till the desired thinness is achieved.
  For lasagna or fettucini you stop at the next to last slot. For
  taglierini or calzonicchi, go through the last slot once, wait a few
  seconds, then feed the sheet into the last slot again. (Pasta made
  with only eggs and flour tends to be very elastic and it tends to
  shrink. However, the second time through it keeps the shape better.)
    Repeat with the remaining pasta, using 1/4th of the original
  quantity each time. Use as directed in the individual recipe.
  
  *for electric pasta makers, follow the manufacturer's directions, but
  most machines will not provide sheet pasta for lasagna, ravoli, etc.
  
  SERVES: 6 to 16, depending on the different uses made of it.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 md Red onion
      3    Celery stalks
      1 md Garlic clove
      2 md Carrots
     10    Sprigs Italian parsley,
           -leaves only
      4 oz Pancetta
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 lb Lean ground beef
      1 c  Dry red wine
      1 c  Drained canned imported
           -Italian tomatoes
           Salt, freshly ground pepper
           -to taste

MMMMM------------------------DOLCE-FORTE-----------------------------
    1/2 c  Red wine vinegar
      4 tb Raisins
      2 tb Pine nuts
      1 tb Semi-sweet chocolate chips
      1 tb Sugar

MMMMM---------------------------PASTA--------------------------------
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      4    Extra-large eggs
      2 ts Olive oil (optional)
      4    Level tablespoons
           -unsweetened cocoa powder

MMMMM-------------------------FOR PASTA------------------------------
           Coarse salt
 
  The sauce: Finely chop onion, celery, garlic, carrots and parsley
  together on a board or in a food processor. Cut pancetta into small
  pieces.
  
  Heat the oil in a terra-cotta or enamel saucepan. When hot, add the
  chopped ingredients and pancetta and saute slowly over low heat for
  about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Mix in
  ground beef and when it is no longer reddish, add wine and let it
  evaporate for about 5 minutes.
  
  Pass the tomatoes through a food mill to remove seeds and, when the
  wine has evaporated, add tomatoes to the saucepan. Taste for salt and
  pepper and simmer slowly for about 25 minutes.
  
  Dolce-forte: Put all 5 ingredients in a small bowl and set aside for
  about 20 minutes. When the meat sauce is ready, add the dolce-forte
  to the saucepan. Stir to incorporate and simmer 5 minutes longer.
  
  The pasta: You can make it by hand, of course, but this seems the
  simpler way. Place ingredients in a food processor with the metal
  blade and pulse on and off until a ball of dough forms. Turn out,
  gently knead into a ball, cover with a towel and let rest about 1/2
  hour. Divide dough into quarters and knead until smooth by putting
  through pasta machine rollers, starting with widest setting and
  working down to the last setting (pasta will be very, very thin). Cut
  into tagliatelle (the wider cutter) and let stand on a board, loosely
  covered with a clean towel, until needed (do not let dry out).
  
  Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil. Add coarse-grained salt to
  taste. Prepare a warmed serving dish by spreading 1 cup of the sauce
  over the bottom.
  
  Add the pasta to the boiling salted water and cook for about 30
  seconds after the water has returned to a boil. Drain and put in
  prepared serving dish. Pour remaining sauce over pasta and toss very
  well. Serve immediately.

      3    Eggs
    1/3 c  Chopped Italian parsley
           Grated Parmesan cheese
           Fresh ground pepper to taste
 
  1.  Saute the bacon in a small skillet until crisp. Remove with a
  slotted spoon and drain well on a paper towel. 2. Boil the water and
  cook linguini until firm and tender. 3. Meanwhile, beat the eggs
  thoroughly in a large bowl suitable for serving. Have the cooked
  bacon and the chopped parsley ready at hand. 4. When the pasta is
  done, drain it immediately in a colander, and pour into the bowl of
  eggs and immediately begin tossing it. As the strands of pasta become
  coated with the beaten eggs, their heat will cook the eggs. 5.
  Sprinkle the bacon and parsley on, and serve immediately. This is
  great with lots of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and freshly ground
  black pepper.

 Categories: Fish and se, Italian dis, Pasta dishe
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Shrimp -- shelled &
           Deveined
    1/4 c  Olive oil (plus oil for
           Greasing dish)
      1 tb Shallots -- finely chopped
      1 tb Garlic -- finely minced
    1/3 lb Sea scallops
      1 c  Red ripe tomatoes -- finely
           Chopped
      1 c  Fresh chicken broth or
           Bottled clam broth
      2 tb Parsley -- finely chopped
    1/2 ts Oregano
      3 tb Cognac
      4    Littleneck clams
      4    Mussels -- well-scrubbed
    1/4 lb Lump crabmeat
    1/3 lb Perciatelli -- See Note
    1/3 lb Mezza-lasagna -- See Note
    1/3 lb Fettucine
     10 sm Fresh basil leaves
 
  STEP ONE: Cut the shrimp lengthwise in half. Cut each half crosswise.
  Set aside. Heat the oil in a skillet and add the shallots and garlic.
  Cook, stirring, about one minute. Add the shrimp and shallots and
  cook, stirring, about one minute. Add the tomatoes and broth and
  bring to a boil. Let simmer about one minute and add the parsley,
  oregano, and Cognac.
  
  STEP TWO: Add the clams and mussels and cover closely. Cook until the
  clams and mussels open, about one and a half minutes. Add the crab
  meat, stir gently, and remove from the heat.
  
  STEP THREE: Bring four quarts of water to a boil and add the
  perciatelli. Cook, stirring down with a fork, about one and a half
  minutes, and add the fettucine and the mezza-lasagna. Continue
  cooking about six minutes.
  
  STEP FOUR: Meanwhile, spread out on a flat surface a sheet of
  aluminum foil measuring about 17 by 30 inches. Fold the foil over
  itself to make a rectangle measuring 15 by 17 inches. Fold over the
  open edges to seal. Drain the pasta and place it in the foil bag.
  Pour the sauce with the seafood into the bag. Scatter the basil
  leaves on top of the pasta and sauce. Fold the open end of the foil
  to seal it all around hermetically.
  
  STEP FIVE: Lightly oil the bottom of a metal, flame-proof dish or
  baking sheet and place the pasta-filled foil bag on top. Turn the
  burner to high. Cook for about two minutes, until the bag puffs like
  a pillow.
  
  STEP SIX: To Serve-- Using a sharp knife, cut a long slit on one side
  of the bag. Divide the pasta and seafood among four heated dishes.
  
  CHEF'S NOTE: If perciatelli or mezza-lasagna are not available,
  substitute equal amounts of fettucine and cook for nine to twelve
  minutes.

  nuts and finally the oil. Allow each ingredient to blend smoothly
  with the preceding ones, then let stand 1 hour. This is the Pesto
  Sauce.
  
  Prepare pasta according to package directions. Mix pesto with pasta
  fresh from the boiling water. Do not add too much pesto, but allow
  each person a chance to adjust flavor by taste, by adding more pesto
  if desired. Leftover pesto will last for a long time if refrigerated
  in a plastic container, but do not freeze.
  
  A light salad with oil and vinegar dressing and a veal dish go great
  with this. Pasta Con Pesto is also a versatile accompaniment to a
  variety of dishes-meat, fish, poultry, etc.

           But the quality will suffer
      1 ts Salt
      3    Eggs
           Heavy cream -- as needed
 
  Place the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse to mix. Add
  the eggs and pusle again. Add enough heavy cream to make the dough
  form a ball, don't add to much or it will become sticky. Knead by
  hand for a few minutes, shape into a ball, place in a floured bowl
  and let rest for 1/2 hour. Divide the dough into manageable amounts
  and run thru a pasta machine to desired thickness. Let the dough rest
  again for another 1/2 hour before trying to cut with a pasta machine.
  It makes the cutting go a lot smoother. The time here depends on the
  thickness of the pasta and the weather(humid or not) Cook in 5 quarts
  of water with 1/2 teaspoon added for 1 to 2 minutes or until al
  dante. Can also be dried or frozen for later use.
  
  Any herbs or spices can be added with the flour and salt at the
  beginning. Quantities here are by personal preference.

 Categories: Italian, Breads, Pasta
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/3 c  All purpose flour
           (for better pasta, use
  1 1/3 c  AP flour and
      1 c  Semolina flour)
      2 lg Eggs
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Water
 
  Mix 2 cups flour and salt in bowl, reserve 1/3 cup for later. Make a
  well in the center Mix eggs, olive oil and water and pour into well.
  Stir flour into egg mixture until dough forms into a ball. Turn out
  onto floured surface and kneed for about 10 minutes, adding extra
  flour if too moist. Kneed until dough is smooth and elastic. Cover
  with towel and rest for 30 minutes. Cut into 4 portions, keep pieces
  covered until used.
  
  Get out your machine and set dial on widest setting (1 on the Atlas).
  Flatten dough ball and run through rollers several times until smooth
  (you may add a bit of flour here too). Move rollers to next setting
  and roll again once. Continue to roll until pasta is the proper
  thickness (5 or 6 on the Atlas).  You may cut sheet in half if it's
  too long. Continue with other pieces and then put the finished sheet
  aside to dry for about 3 minutes.  Attach desired pasta cutters and
  run the sheets through.
  
  You can use right away or spread out the pasta to dry overnight and
  then freeze extra.
  
  To cook, drop into large pot of boiling water with a bit of salt and
  oil. Cook until al dente, which should only take about 2 minutes for
  fresh.
  
  A tip - be sure the dough is fairly dry, otherwise it won't cut into
  separate strands.
  
  Another tip - You can substitute heavy cream for the 1/3 c water for a
  richer pasta. Great for fettuchini alfredo.

 Categories: Desserts, Greek
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Butter, melted
      1 ea Egg yolk
    1/3 c  Sugar

  dough. Separate into 2 parts. Roll one out into a fairly thick crust;
  place in a square pan.  Break off a piece of dough from the remaining
  half and roll between your palms into a coil to fit around the crust.
  Wet the edge of the crust with a little water and gently press the
  coil around the edges, so it adheres to the crust, and against the
  sides of the pan; shape with the fingers to form the side crust.
  Spread the marmalade over the bottom crust. Shape additional coils,
  each about as thick as your little finger, from the rest of the
  dough, and lay them on the marmalade in a crisscross latticework
  pattern. Join to the crust with a little water. Bake in preheated 300
  F. oven for 30 to 40 min.  Cool and cut into squares.

      Title: PASTA FLORA~ ATHENS STYLE
 Categories: Greek, Desserts, Pasta
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
    1/2 lb Sweet butter
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      2    Eggs
      6 tb Cognac
      2 c  All-purpose flour (or more)
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Stewed apricots
      4    Dried figs
    1/3 c  Raisins
      1    Orange (grated rind only)
      1 c  Apricot jam
      1 tb Lemon juice (optional)
      2 ts Cornstarch
    1/3 c  Orange juice
 
  Using an electric mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy and
  gradually add the sugar, 1 egg and an egg yolk, and 3 tablespoons of
  the Cognac, beating thoroughly after each addition. Sift 2 cups of
  the flour with the salt and baking powder and add slowly to the
  batter, while beating on medium speed.  Remove the beaters and finish
  by hand, adding only enough flour to make a soft dough.  Knead.
  Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, slice the apricots into uniform pieces and place in an
  enameled pan.  Soak the figs and raisins in the remaining Cognac
  until swollen, then mince and add to the apricots along with the
  orange rind, jam, and lemon juice and stir into the apricot mixture,
  then cook over medium heat until thick, stirring constantly with a
  wooden spoon. Cool.
  
  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and set aside about one-third
  for the latticed top.   Using your fingers (the dough will be too
  soft to roll), press the larger portion of dough into a buttered 9 x
  12 x 2-inch baking pan, pressing evenly about 1/4-inch up the sides.
  Pour the filling into the dough-lined pan.
  
  Divide the remaining dough into walnut-sized balls and roll each ball
  into 1/2-inch strips.  Using the strips, make a lattice over the top
  of the pastry.  If using a glaze, beat the remaining egg white
  slightly with a fork and brush on the dough stips.  Bake in a
  moderate oven (350 F) for 45 minutes, or until golden in color.
  Remove and cool in the pan on a rack. To serve, cut into 1-1/2-inch
  (or smaller) squares with a sharp knife.
  
  Note: You may prefer to use peaches and peach jam, strawberries and
  strawberry jam, and so on, instead of apricots; also diced candied
  peel adds a colorful note when substituting for figs; and slivered
  almonds may be added to the filling.

      Title: PASTA FRITTATA
 Categories: Appetizers, Breads, Cheese, Eggs, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Egg
      2 c  Cooked Spaghetti -- cut 1 in
           Lengths
    1/4 ts Black Pepper
    1/4 c  Parmesan Cheese -- grated
      2 tb Olive Oil
    1/2 c  Mozzarella Cheese -- diced
      2 lg Roma Tomatoes -- diced
      2    Green Onions -- chopped
      2 oz Prosciutto -- sliced
      2 tb Italian Parsley -- chopped
 
  1. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Mix in the spaghetti,
  pepper and grated Parmesan.
  
  2. In a medium non-stick skillet, heat the oil over medium flame. Add
  half of the pasta mixture, spreading it out to the edges like a
  pancake. Spread the diced mozzarella in a single layer on top, then
  layer on the tomatoes, green onions and prosciutto. Finish by
  spreading the remaining pasta on top and pouring any egg left in the
  bowl over it. Cook on low until the bottom is browned and crisp,
  about 5 minutes.
  
  3. When the bottom has set and is golden brown, flip the frittata
  over, using either a large spatula or sliding it onto a plate and
  then inverting it back into the pan. Cook, uncovered, another 5
  minutes, or until the bottom is crisp and golden.
  
  4. To serve, slide the frittata out of the pan. Cut into 4 wedges and
  sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve warm or at room temperature.
  NOTES:
  
  The Italian omelette, known as a frittata, varies from the traditional
  French omelette in 3 ways. First, the frittata fillings are beaten in
  with the eggs, instead of being folded inside. Second, the frittata
  may be finished by either flipping over the whole omelette in the
  pan, or running it under the broiler. Third, as described above,
  whereas the French omelette is folded, the Italian frittata is cooked
  in one, round piece. Both types have their attributes, and preference
  is merely a matter of taste.
  
  I am, however, partial to this particular frittata recipe. Pasta,
  which can be leftover from a previous meal, is cooked in the eggs
  with layers of tomatoes, cheese, seasonings and prosciutto. This is a
  wonderfully simple yet absolutely delectable omelette, and it can
  even be made in advance. The recipe makes 4 small to medium-size
  portions, enough for a light breakfast or first course. If desired,
  add 2 more eggs and increase the other ingredients accordingly for a
  heartier, more substantial meal.

      Title: PASTA FRITTATA WITH WATERCRESS & SAUSAGE
 Categories: Eggs, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Russet Rose White potatoes
    1/4    " dice
      1 qt Boiling water
      4 oz Eggless linguini -- see
           Note
           Olive oil cooking spray
      4 oz Turkey-Pork Sausage -- note
      2    Scallions with stalk --
           Chopped
      1 c  Egg substitute -- or
      4 md Eggs -- whipped
    1/2 ts Virgin olive oil -- light
           Freshly ground pepper -- to
           Taste
      2 tb Chopped cilantro
      2 oz Watercress sprigs -- note
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      1 c  Fresh fruit
 
  Ingredient notes: *Pasta: We used PastaZesta (r) eggless Linguini.
  This brand is mildly flavored. We like the garlic and parsley.
  Optional: shorten the pasta by breaking it in two. *Sausage: Low-fat
  option: buy a spicy pork sausage, that pairs poultry with the pork,
  or uses all poultry. (e.g.,Jimmy Dean, Turkey-Store, etc.)
  *Watercress: Cut off and discard the toughest stems leaving sprigs.
  Wash in a pan of cold water. Rinse well. Drain in collander. Coarsely
  chop watercress leaves and stems separately *Eggs: add the 1/2
  teaspoon of oilive oil to the eggs. Beat the eggs with whisk or
  rotary beater to lighten with air. Bring the water to a boil; add the
  potato dice and cook 5 to 7 minutes, till al dente. Meanwhile, add
  the fast-cooking pasta to the boiling potatoes at the appropriate
  time. Drain, keep warm. Meanwhile, position oven rack so that pan is
  about 4 to 6 inches below element. Preheat the broiler. Meanwhile:
  start browning the sausage in an oven/broiler proof saute pan or
  casserole (1-1/2 qt capacity). Apply spray to prevent sticking and
  drying. Crumble the sausage as it cooks as finely as possible. Add
  the chopped onion to the pan, and saute till warmed, about 2 minutes
  maximum. Add the chopped cilantro and watercress STEMS. Toss for 1-2
  minutes. Add drained potato and pasta. Toss well. Pour in whipped
  eggs. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover, and cook to set all but the
  very top. Place under the broiler, remove immediately when it has
  turned a golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes.  Garnish with Parmesan cheese
  and watercress LEAVES. Serve with fresh fruit.

  Note: This is a really simple throw-together dressing that works well
  with other seasonings, fresh herbs, lime juice instead of lemon, and
  even lowfat mayonnaise and yogurt, too. You can enjoy this creamy
  dressing as above for a hearty summer meal, or simply serve it as a
  smooth dressing for your tossed green salad.

  Combine flour, eggs and salt in a processor and mix well. With machine

  Remove the ball from the processor. Cover dough and let rest 30 min.
  Cut dough into 4 quarters. Flatten 1 piece at a time leaving the
  remainder covered, then fold in thirds. Turn pasta machine to widest
  setting and run the dough through several times until smooth and
  velvety, folding before each run and dusting with flour if sticky.
  Adjust machine to next narrower setting. Run dough through machine
  without folding. Repeat, narrowing rollers after each run, until
  pasta is 1/8" thick, dusting with flour if necessary. Line baking
  sheets with towels. Set sheet of dough on work surface. Place about
  1-1/2 tsp of a filling at 2" intervals along sheet. Roll second piece
  of dough and set it on top of first sheet. Press down around filling
  to seal the dough. Cut into 2-inch squares. Arrange on prepared
  sheets. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Cover with towel and
  let stand 1/2 hr. Cook ravioli in a large pot of boiling, salted

      Title: PASTA O'DOOLE
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Small seashells or macaroni
      1 cn Great northern beans (no
           Other beans taste as good as
           These)
     16 oz Tomato sauce (use the plain
           Variety not the spaghetti
           Sauce)
 
  Mix beans (with the liquid) with the tomato sauce and heat. Prepare
  pasta and toss with sauce. Add tons of black pepper and eat. I used a
  jumbo can of diced tomatoes and pureed them instead since I was out
  of the plain tomato sauce. Guess what I ate for lunch today?? This.
  
  Source: This is an old family treat that my Mom used to make when Dad
  was out of town since he hates beans.

 Categories: Pasta, Main dish, Italian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 ea Pasta ; fresh 9 x 12 (appro
      6 oz Prosciuttos; thinly slices
      1 lb Spinach; leaves only, steam
      4 oz Ricotta cheese
      2 oz Mozzarella cheese,
      4 tb Reggiano parmesan cheese; g
      1 x  Salt
      1 x  Pepper
      1 x  Nutmeg
      1 x  Creamy tomato sauce
     35 oz Plum tomato; drained
      3 tb Sweet butter
      2 ea Med Onion; finely chopped
      1 c  Dry white wine
      2 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Heavy cream
 
  Bring a huge pot of salted water to a boil. Drop pasta in and cook for
  about 2 minutes. The cooking time is going to differ due to the
  varying thicknesses of pasta sheets. Test yours several times to
  allow it to cook--AL DENTE! Remove sheets from water and rinse
  off--handle carefully--then place on sheets of plastic wrap. Blot top
  of sheet w/paper towel and cover the pasta w/ prosciuttos in 1 layer.
  Spread the spinach/cheese mixture over the prosciuttos and roll up
  with the 6" side. Use the plastic wrap to assist you in rolling it
  tightly and then wrap the roll in the plastic wrap and refrigerate
  until you are ready to use. This sauce is made by combining liquids &
  reducing them in different stages. It is delicious and worth the
  time. It's also very easy to do. Melt butter in large skillet and
  saute onions until they begin to brown (don't let them burn) Add wine
  to skillet, bring mixture to a boil and reduce liquid to about 1/4
  cup. Add chicken stock and return mixture to a boil. Reduce this
  mixture until there is about 1/2 cup. Squeeze the drained tomatoes
  through your fingers to break them up and add them to the reduced
  liquids in the skillet, bring to a boil and reduce to low heat and
  simmer for about 30 minutes, watching carefully and stirring
  frequently. Add heavy cream, continue cooking slowly for 10 minutes.
  Taste, adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. ASSEMBLY: Remove pasta
  rolls from plastic wrap and---> put in to skillet with the sauce.
  REMEMBER: The pasta is completely cooked. You only want to heat it
  thoroughly in the sauce. When it is heated, cut off each end of the
  roll to make it even.
   Then cut roll into 3 equal pcs. To serve, place pool of sauce on
  bottom of plate & put 2 or 3 pcs of pasta roll on each plate, with
  the pinwheel side up.
   Sprinkle w/grated cheese if you like it &enjoy

      Title: PASTA PRIMAVERA (LACTO)
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2    To 2/3 lb pasta (I like
           Fusili--the spirals)
      1    Onion
    1/2 lb Mushrooms
      4    Or 5 cloves garlic
      1 ea Some dry sherry
      1    Tin SKIM evaporated milk
           (less than 3 g fat per tin)
      1    Red pepper
      1    Green pepper
      1 ts Salt
      1 ea Black pepper
 
  Chop the onion, garlic, and mushroom.  Saute over high heat in enouch
  sherry to keep it wet for about 10 minutes. Put the pasta water on to
  boil.
  
  Reduce the heat under the veggies and add the tin of milk. Put the
  pasta in the boiling water.  Simmer the sauce over low heat while the
  pasta cooks. Chop up the red and green peppers and add them to the
  simmering sauce. Add salt & black pepper to taste. Let simmer for
  about 5 minutes, which should be enough time to cook the pasta.
  
  Drain the pasta, pour the sauce over the pasta, and serve. Sprinkle
  with a bit of parmisan cheese or nutritional yeast, and more black
  pepper, to taste.
  
  Variations:  obviously, vary the vegitable content. Sun dried
  tomatoes are one of my favourite candidates.

      Title: PASTA PRIMAVERA WITH ROASTED RED PEPPERS
 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Red peppers
      1 lb Asparagus
      3 tb Olive oil
      2    Garlic cloves, minced or put
           -through a press
    1/2 ts Coarse salt
      1    Bunch basil
      1 lb Fresh peas, shelled
           -OR
      1 c  Thawed frozen peas
    1/2 lb Spinach pasta
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley, pref.
           -Italian flat-leaf
    1/2 c  Fresh grated Parmesan cheese
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
           Radish roses for garnish
 
  (From "Mediterranean Light" by Martha Rose Shulman, Bantam).
  
  Roast 2 of the red peppers, either under a broiler or above a burner
  flame, turning until all sides are charred. Remove from the heat and
  place in a paper bag or damp towel. Allow to cool.
  
  Meanwhile, cut off the tips of the asparagus, about 2" from the top.
  Trim off the tough base of the asparagus and cut the remaining stalks
  into pieces about 1/2" long. Keep the tops separate from the stalks.
  cut the remaining red pepper into thin lengthwise strips and cut
  these strips in half or into thirds.
  
  When the roasted peppers are cool enough to handle, remove the skins
  and pat dry. Remove the stems, seeds and membranes and cut into thin
  strips. Place in a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil,
  1 of the garlic cloves, the coarse salt, and 8 large leaves basil,
  cut into slivers. Toss together, cover, and refrigerate for at least
  1 hour.
  
  Mince the remaining basil. Steam the peas, asparagus tips, and
  asparagus stalks separately, just until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes
  for the asparagus, 5-10 minutes for the peas. Refresh under cold
  water.
  
  Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt, and cook the pasta al
  dente. Drain and toss with the remaining olive oli, which you have
  mixed with the remaining garlic clove. Refrigerate until shortly
  before ready to serve or leave at room temperature if serving soon.
  
  Shortly before serving, toss the pasta with the steamed peas,
  asparagus stalks, sliced raw pepper, minced basil, parsley, Parmesan
  and salt and pepper to taste. Serve on individual plates and top each
  portion with a spoonful of roasted red peppers. Place spears of
  asparagus and a few radishes on the side and serve.

      Title: PASTA PRIMER
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           No ingredients
 
  Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water, with a tablespoon
  of olive oil added to keep pasta from sticking together. After adding
  pasta, stir once.
  
  Pasta should be cooked until it is just tender - not too hard and not
  too soft - or AL DENTE ("to the tooth"). Taste for doneness as it
  cooks. Cooking time starts when the water returns to a full boil
  after adding pasta.
  
  Dry pasta takes longer to cook than fresh. Begin tasting after it has
  cooked for 5-6 minutes, depending on the shape and size. Fresh pasta
  may take no longer than 2-3 minutes.
  
  For hot pasta dishes, rinse just-cooked pasta under warm water to
  remove starch, if desired. (A bit of starch holds the sauce better.)
  Rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. Pasta is best when
  drained and served with sauce immediately.
  
  For best flavor when making pasta salads, toss pasta with a
  vinaigrette-style dressing while it's still warm.
  
  Rule of thumb: heavy sauces for heavy, shaped pastas and thick
  ribbons; light sauces for small, shaped pastas and thin ribbons.
  
  Save a small amount of hot cooking liquid to toss into the pasta if it
  seems too dry, depending on the sauce.
  
  When serving cheese, use only freshly grated. Invest in a large
  piece. It keeps refrigerated for a long time when well wrapped.
  
  It's fun and practical to serve pasta in shallow bowls.
  
  For best results, use a large tossing bowl, so the pasta and sauce
  are not cramped.

 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS
      3 T  Olive oil or vegetable oil
      3    Cloves garlic; minced
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      1    Red bell pepper; chopped
    1/2 c  Green pepper; chopped
      2 md Zucchini; sliced thickly
      1    Crookneck squash; sliced
           -thickly
      1 lg Eggplant; cut thickly
      2 lg Cans tomatoes (28 oz each);
           -drained well
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Dried basil
    1/4 ts Dried oregano
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Pkg. rigatoni or curly
           Shaped pasta
           Parmesan cheese; freshly
           -grated
 
  In a large sauce pot at least 6-quarts, heat the oil over medium
  heat. Add garlic and stir for a few seconds and then add onion and
  peppers. Cook for about 5 minutes stirring every so often to move the
  mixture around in the pot.  When the vegetables are fairly soft, add
  the eggplant and squashes. Stir fry and continue to cook stirring
  quite often for at least another 5 minutes.  You may have to add a
  little more oil to the pan if it looks dry. Add tomatoes which can be
  crushed with a spoon if you wish and the sugar and spices. Bring it
  to a boil and then reduce the heat. Cover the pan leaving it ajar
  slightly to let the steam to escape and cook about 10-15 minutes more
  making sure you stir it every so often. Remove the cover and simmer
  another 5 minutes or so until vegetables appear soft and cooked
  through.
  
  While the vegetables are simmering, you can cook the pasta according
  to the directions on the package.  Drain the pasta and toss the
  vegetable mixture with it.  Serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
  
  Note:  I sometimes add some sliced mushrooms and black olives which is
  definitely not a traditional ratatouille, however, it makes it taste
  wonderful.  I also sometimes add about 1/3 cup fume blanc or other dry
  white wine when I add the tomatoes and spices.

      Title: PASTA ROLLS
 Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs, Main dish, Entertain
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 lb Ricotta Cheese (skim milk is
           -good)
      4 oz Mozzarella, grated
      4 oz Romano, grated
  1 1/2 c  Parmesan, grated
      3    Eggs, whole or whites only
      2 lb Pasta, homemade & fresh is
           -best. In STRIPS!!!!!!!
      1 qt Chicken broth, VERY strong!
           Salt & Pepper to taste.
           Parmesan Cheese for topping
           Tomatoe sauce, spaghetti
           -sauce in a pinch. Should be
           -smooth.
           Yards of string
           Yards of CHEESECLOTH !!!!
 
  Make the cheese filling. Simply mix all the cheeses and then add the
  BEATEN eggs or egg whites. Make sure the harder cheeses are grated.
  They mix better that way. This is a relatively bland mixture as is
  but don't worry. Make the pasta. Use your favorite recipe. Green
  pasta is really neat for the effect. God knows the taste is great
  too. Cut the pasta into ABOUT 6" wide stips. The length is according
  to what it's for. If your serving this for dinner make the strips
  about 18" long. For appetizers or side dishes then only make them 6"
  to 10" long. Now simply lay out a piece of pasta. Smear filling on
  it. Like frosting a cake. EXCEPT leave about «" free of filliing on
  the EDGES. The begining END can be covered. The last few inches of
  the strip should be left bare too. Now simply roll it up! Try to keep
  it as stright as possible, but don't stroke out if it's a little off.
  Keep repeating until you have one or two rolls per person. Set aside
  until all of them are made. Cut a piece of cheesecloth long enough to
  fully wrap around a roll with several inches of overlap. Repeat until
  you have all the cloth pieces cut. Simply wrap each pasta roll in one
  piece of cheesecloth. Tie the cloth closed. MAKE SURE IT'S LOOSE. The
  pasta will swell quite a bit. Make your sauce and heat. Smooth sauce
  I think works for a nicer visual effect. Keep it hot, but on the
  side. Now POACH the pasta rolls in your chicken broth. Until they're
  done, about 15 minutes should take care of it. But make sure it's
  really only a simmer. If the broth is boiling it can cause the cheese
  to push out of the pasta and/or the pasta to simply break-up (it's
  not pretty!) Here's the fun part. Take the pasta rolls out of the
  broth. Cut the string and unwrap each one. Slice them like sausages,
  into rounds, except about 2" thick. Place several slices onto each
  plate, cut side up, according to appetite. Pour sauce onto plate.
  Swirl on plate. I do not like covering the swirling of the green
  pasta and the white of the cheese with the sauce. I think it shows up
  better with the sauce as a background color. Also having to "dip" the
  pices of the roll in the sauce makes for a nice taste. Sprinkle a
  little parmesan cheese and/or chopped parsley. This is a really good
  recipe. You might try using the filling from Tony's Manicotti with
  four cheeses in place of my bland one.

  parmesan and the cheese in the tortellini.

      Title: PASTA SALAD WITH ROCKET & TOMATO DRESSING
 Categories: Salads, Pasta, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Ripe tomatoes, peeled,
      2    De-seeded and chopped
           Finely
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped
           Finely
      2 oz (60 g) rocket leaves,
           Chopped coarsely
      1 tb Olive oil
      8 oz (240 g) penne pasta
           (quills)
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
 
  1. Place the tomatoes, garlic and rocket leaves in a bowl. Add the
  olive oil and season well with the salt and pepper. Cover and
  refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 2. Cook the pasta in plenty of
  lightly salted boiling water for 8 -1 0 minutes until al dente. Rinse
  well with cold water and drain thoroughly. Toss the pasta with the
  chilled tomato mixture and serve.
  
  Cook's notes: Serve this salad warm - simply toss the hot, drained
  pasta into the chilled tomato sauce. If they are available, plum
  tomatoes taste delicious in this recipe.
  
  Preparation and cooking time: 20 minutes + 2 hours chilling
  
  Freezing not recommended You don't have to travel to Italy to enjoy
  wild rughetta, a spiky green-leaved plant with a strong peppery
  flavour. Most supermarkets now sell rocket, a slightly milder
  cultivated variety. If you can't find it, use spinach or a mixture of
  lamb's lettuce and watercress. Variation: Sprinkle each serving with
  1/2 oz (15 g) grated parmesan cheese.

      2 oz (60 g) rocket leaves,
           Chopped coarsely
      1 tb Olive oil

           (quills)
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
 
  1. Place the tomatoes, garlic and rocket leaves in a bowl. Add the
  olive oil and season well with the salt and pepper. Cover and
  refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 2. Cook the pasta in plenty of
  lightly salted boiling water for 8 -1 0 minutes until al dente. Rinse
  well with cold water and drain thoroughly. Toss the pasta with the
  chilled tomato mixture and serve.
  
  Cook's notes: Serve this salad warm - simply toss the hot, drained
  pasta into the chilled tomato sauce. If they are available, plum
  tomatoes taste delicious in this recipe.

  wild rughetta, a spiky green-leaved plant with a strong peppery
  flavour. Most supermarkets now sell rocket, a slightly milder
  cultivated variety. If you can't find it, use spinach or a mixture of
  lamb's lettuce and watercress.

  present. Use the fingers to pull the fillets from the bone. Discard
  the bones.
   Set the fillets aside.  Open the clams or have them opened and
  reserve both the clams and 1 cup of clam juice. Finely chop the clams
  and set aside.  Heat the oil and butter in a skillet. Add the garlic
  and shallots and cook until light brown.  Add the anchovies and stir
  until they dissolve.  Add the parsley, rosemary, reserved clam juice
  and white wine and bring to a boil.  Add pepper and a tiny bit of
  salt and simmer 15 minutes.  Add the chopped clams and cook 5
  minutes. Serve piping hot over the freshly cooked pasta. Serve red
  pepper flakes on the side, if desired, but no cheese. Rita in

  Put the orange zest, garlic, and parsley in a food processor fitted
  with the metal blade. Pulse the machine several times, stopping to
  scrape down the bowl, then process until finely chopped. Bring the
  reduced broth to a boil in a saucepan. (To make reduced broth,
  briskly boil 2 cups of broth until it evaporates to one cup.) Set it
  aside, covered. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over
  moderate-to-high heat. Saute the asparagas until tender-crisp, about
  3 minutes. Spoon the asparagas over freshly cooked pasta. Sprinkle
  with the gremolata, then moisten with the hot broth. Note: Use a
  small, sharp paring knife to cut the strips of zest very carefully
  from an orange, making sure to remove none of the bitter white pith.

 Categories: Fish & seaf, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     40    Steamer clams, about 2
           Pounds
      1 lb Medium raw shrimp
      8 oz Rotelle, fettucine, or your
           Favorite pasta
      3 tb Extra virgin olive oil
      2 oz Parmesan cheese
      1 sm Bunch cilantro, large stems
           Removed -- (about 1
           Cup)
    1/2 c  Fresh basil leaves
      2 tb Fresh ginger -- finely
           Minced
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
    1/4 c  Dry sherry
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 ts Asian chile sauce
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Whipping cream
 
  Advance preparation: Scrub the clams and refrigerate. Shell, devein,
  and split the shrimp nearly in half lengthwise. In separate
  containers, set aside the pasta, oil, and cheese. To make the sauce,
  place all the sauce ingredients except the cream in an electric
  blender and blend at the highest speed until completely liquefied.
  Transfer to a container, stir in the cream, and refrigerate. All
  advance preparation steps may be completed up to 8 hours before you
  begin the final cooking steps. Final cooking steps: Grate the cheese,
  about 1/2 cup. Bring 4 quarts of water to a rapid boil.
  
  Lightly salt the water, then cook the pasta according to the
  instructions on the package.  When the pasta loses its raw taste but
  is still slightly firm, remove from the heat and drain. Meanwhile,
  place a small colander lined with cheesecloth in a bowl.  Place a 12-
  or 14-inch saute pan over high heat.  Add 1/4 inch of water. When the
  water comes to a rapid boil, add the clams, cover and steam until all
  the clams open, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Immediately tip the clams into
  the colander lined with cheesecloth.  Then add 3/4 cup of the
  clam-steaming water to the cilantro sauce. Return the empty saute pan
  to high heat. Add the olive oil. When the oil becomes hot, add the
  shrimp. Stir and toss until the shrimp turn white. Add the cilantro
  sauce. When the cilantro sauce comes to a boil and thickens slightly,
  add the clams (but not the remaining liquid in the bowl) and combine
  evenly with the sauce. Place the pasta on a heated platter or 4
  heated dinner plates.  Spoon the seafood and sauce on top of the
  pasta. Sprinkle with cheese and serve at once. Suggested
  Accompaniments: Green bean and walnut salad and a ginger-praline
  mousse.

  A simple pure of steamed courgettes and garlic is all that this
  sauce is - and it is wonderful. The flavours are lovely, the colour
  is fresh green. Serve this dish with a tossed salad and some fresh
  bread.
  
  Steam the courgettes until tender, about 5 minutes. Cool, chop them,
  then put in the liquidizer and blend to a pure with the olive oil.
  Season to taste with garlic, salt and pepper.
  
  Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water until 'al dente', then drain
  well. Toss the vinaigrette into the warm pasta and serve on warm
  plates. Spoon the courgette sauce over the top and garnish with
  chopped chives. Sprinkle grated cheese over the top.

 Categories: Pasta, Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 sm Onion
      1    Piece of fresh ginger, 1 cm
           -grated
    1/2 tb Olive oil
    150 ml Fish stock
     60 ml Dry Sherry
           Salt to taste
           Cayenne to taste
      1 lg Avocado
    1/2    Lemon, juice only
    300 g  Crabmeat
           Cooked pasta for four
 
  If you don't want the trouble of dismantling crabs to obtain the crab
  meat, use frozen meat. Canned crab meat is very poor by comparison.
  And if you haven't time to make fish stock, chicken stock can be
  substituted at a pinch, though the result won't be quite as good.
  
  Boil a large pot of water and cook enough pasta of your choice for 4.
  Meanwhile, chop a small onion, grate a centimetre or so of fresh
  ginger and simmer them gently in 1/2 tablespoon olive oil until soft.
  Add 150 mL fish stock and 60mL good quality dry sherry plus salt and
  cayenne pepper to taste. Mash or process together the flesh of 1
  large avocado and the juice of half a lemon. Add the avocado to the
  fish stock together with 300 g of crab meat, and stir well, leaving
  the sauce on the heat just long enough to heat through. Taste and
  adjust the seasoning. and add more lemon juice if necessary. Serve
  over the hot pasta.

  and make it a smooth consistency. Adjust the seasoning.
  
       In another saute pan, add Madeira wine to 3 tablespoons of
  truffles. Reduce over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.
  
       Strain the cream sauce into the truffles and wine, then reduce
  it to a smooth consistency.
  
  To Assemble: ============
  
       Cook the pasta in plain boiling water, then drain. In a saute
  pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of chopped
  truffles, salt, and pepper. Add pasta to the saute pan.

      Title: PASTA WITH CREOLE SAUCE
 Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     16 oz Red kidney beans, canned
           Drained and rinsed
      2 ea Bay leaves
  1 1/2 c  Onions, diced
    1/3 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Green bell pepper, thinly
           Sliced
      2 c  Canned tomato puree
      1 tb Garlic, minced
      1 tb Oregano, dried
      1 tb Thyme, dried
    1/8 ts Cayenne
      1 ts Rice wine vinegar
      8 oz Pasta
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
  Prepare the pasta per directions on the package. In a medium sauce
  pan, braise the onions in the red wine over medium high heat. When
  onions are soft, add the green pepper. Before peppers are completely
  softened, add the tomatoes, garlic, oregano, thyme, and two bay
  leaves.
  
  Stew all this together for 20 to 25 minutes.
  
  Add kidney beans, cayenne, and the rice wine vinegar. Add salt and
  pepper to taste.  Stir well and allow to heat through. Serve sauce
  over pasta or rice.
  
  NOTES: I did not braise onions but sauteed them with the garlic in a
  little olive oil.  I did not have puree so I used 16 oz can of diced
  tomatoes processed in a food processor and added an 8 oz can of
  tomato sauce. I brought the sauce to a boil, lowered heat and cooked
  for about 1 1/2 hours.

      Title: PASTA WITH EGGS~ LEEKS & CREAM
 Categories: Pasta, Sauces and
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Dried Pasta -- -or-
    3/4 lb Fresh Pasta -- * see note
      3 md Leeks
    1/4 c  Unsalted Butter -- or
           Salted
      4    Eggs -- -or-
      1 c  Egg Substitute
    1/4 c  Parmesean Cheese -- freshly
           Grated
    1/4 c  Light Cream -- (or
           Evaporated milk)
           Salt
           Fresh Ground Pepper
 
  * recommended angel hair, penne or gemelli.
  
  Trim the leeks, discarding the root end and the tough green tops.
  Slice the leeks lengthwise and wash under cold running water to
  remove all the dirt. Cut the white portions and the tender green tops
  crosswise into very thin slices.
  
  In a large wide frying pan over medium heat melt the butter. Add the
  leeks and saute, stirring until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from
  heat, cover pan and keep warm.
  
  In a bowl, beat together the eggs, cheese, cream and salt and pepper
  to taste.  Set aside.
  
  Cook pasta until almost al dente.  Drain the pasta and add it to the
  frying pan holding the leeks and raise the heat to high. Pour in the
  egg mixture and stir well until the eggs are firm but not dry, 1-2
  minutes.
  
  Serve immediately.  Pass the more cheese at the table.
  
  Serves 4 (unless you have seconds!)
  
  NOTES:
  
  I made this recipe for the first time last night and it was
  scrumptious. And not only was it good, it was fast and easy -- and
  vegetarian (but definitely not vegan). If you put the water for the
  pasta on to boil while slicing the leeks, it can be done in about 15
  minutes. It's going into my "got home late and everyone is starving
  and have to get dinner on the table FAST" file.
  
  The original recipe calls for butter, eggs and cream, which don't fit
  on my low-fat diet.  So I substituted egg-substitute and evaporated
  skim milk for the eggs and cream and cut down on the butter.
  
  The recipe is from the Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library: Pasta Sauces,
  1994 (ISBN 0-7835-0283-4)
  
  The recipe notes that adding 1/4 pound (120 g) diced bacon to saute
  with the leeks turns this into a carbonara sauce.

      Title: PASTA WITH FENNEL TOMATO SAUCE
 Categories: French, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Spaghetti
           Olive oil
      2 ts Garlic; minced
    1/4 ts Crushed red pepper
      1    Fennel bulb (approx 1-1/2
           -cups); diced
      1    Crushed tomatoes
      1    Orange (zest only)
           Salt and pepper
    1/4 c  Cream (optional)
      1    Parsley; chopped
 
  1. Get a large pot of salted water going for the pasta.
  
  2. Gently saute the onion in a little oil until it softens, then add
  the garlic and crushed red peppers.  Cook another few minutes, but
  don't let the garlic brown.
  
  3. Add the fennel and stir.  Cover and sweat until the fennel softens,
  about 10 minutes.
  
  4. Add the tomatoes and orange zest.  Simmer uncovered for about 15
  minutes, then salt and pepper to taste.  (If you're using cream, stir
  it in after about 10 minutes, then let the sauce continue to simmer
  another 5 minutes or so.)
  
  5. Give the sauce a 5 or 10 minute head start, then cook the pasta.
  When it's done, drain and combine the pasta and sauce in the large
  pot. Stir to coat the pasta evenly and let it cook a moment so the
  spaghetti absorbs a little of the sauce.  Then dump it into a serving
  bowl, scatter parsley over all, and serve.
  
  Note on Fennel:  It's sometimes marketed as anise.  The bulb is the
  best part.  Standard procrdure for fennel is to whack off the stalks,
  quarter the bulb lengthwise and cut out the base like you would for
  cabbage. At that point it's ready for slicing or dicing.
  
  Having said the bulb is the best part, I should say that there's
  nothing wrong with the stalks.  in fact, if you were stuck with a
  small bulb, you can dice a stalk and use it in this recipe.  The
  major difference is that the stalks are more fibrous, like celery.
  Actually, the stalks are pretty good to eat raw instead of celery
  (provided you like licorice).

      2 c  Peeled fresh plum tomatoes
           -or canned Italian plum
           -tomatoes.
      4 tb Butter
      2 sm Onions, chopped fine

           Salt and black pepper
    1/2 c  Marsala
    1/2 ts Dried oregano
    1/2 lb Vermicelli
      1 c  Fresh grated Parmesan or
           -Romano cheese

MMMMM-------------------------MEATBALLS------------------------------
    1/2 lb Ground chuck
      2 sl French bread, moistened
           -with 1/2 cup milk and
           -squeezed dry
      1 tb Minced parsley
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
           Salt and ground pepper
      3 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Here's the recipe I made the other night with the nice pasta sauce.
  The meatballs were mediocre, mainly because I'd never made meatballs
  before that I can remember. The sauce, on the other hand, was very
  tasty. For the pasta I used rigatoni++the first type of pasta I made
  with the new machine.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  1.  Put the tomatoes trough a food mill to puree pulp and remove
  seeds.
  
  2.  In a large skillet or medium saucepan, melt half the butter and
  cook the onions9on until soft.  Add the garlic, tomato puree, and
  crumbled bacon.  Then add salt and pepper to taste and boil this
  sauce hard for five minutes.
  
  3.  Add the marsala and oregano, and cook for another
        5    minutes. Set aside.
  
  4.  Put all the meatball ingredients except the vegetable oil in a
  bowl, and mix with your hands. Shape the mixture into 12 balls, and
  in the skillet brown them on all sides in the vegetable oil. Do not
  overcook, they will cook further in the sauce.  Add the meatballs to
  the tomato sauce and keep warm.  (You can brown the meatballs ahead
  of time and add them to the sauce when you are ready.)
  
  5.  Cook the pasta until al dente, drain well and return to the pot in
  which it cooked.  Add remaining butter and toss well. Add several
  large spoonfuls of the tomato sauce and toss well again. Transfer
  pasta to a large serving platter or bowl.  Pour sauce and meatballs
  overall, serve and pass the cheese.

      Title: PASTA WITH MIXED ROASTED PEPPERS VINAIGRETTE
 Categories: Pasta, Sauces, Low-cal, Low-fat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 md Green bell pepper
      1 md Red bell pepper
      1 md Yellow bell pepper
      1 md Orange bell pepper
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 md Garlic cloves, chopped fine
      2 tb Balsamic or good-quality
           -red wine vinegar
      1 tb Basil leaves, finely
           -shredded
      1 tb Italian parsley, finely
           - chopped
           Cooked pasta
 
  Roast, peel, stem, and seed the peppers. To Roast peppers: Place them
  in a foil-lined baking sheet in a 500 degree oven. Roast until their
  skins are evenly blistered and browned, about 25 minutes, turning
  them 2 or 3 times so they roast evenly. Remove them from the oven and
  cover them with a kitchen towel. When peppers are cool enough to
  handle, pull out their stems, peel away their blackened skins; open
  the peppers up; and remove their seeds, using a teaspoon to pick up
  any stray ones. Tear the peppers up into 1/2 to 1/2-inch wide strips,
  and save their juices, set aside. In a large skillet, heat the olive
  oil with the garlic over moderate heat. When the garlic sizzles, add
  the pepper strips and their juices. Then stir in the vinegar. As soon
  as the liquid sizzles, stir in the basil and parsley and spoon the
  sauce over cooked pasta.

      Title: PASTA WITH MUSSELS IN WINE
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Mussels (in their shells)
           White wine (enough to fill
           -a large shallow saucepan
           -about 1/2 an inch)
      2 lg Cloves garlic, finely
           -chopped
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Freshly ground pepper
      3 tb Chopped fresh basil
      1 lg Tomato, coarsely chopped
      2 lb Pasta (good with a ribbon
           -noodle like linguine or
           -fettucini)
 
  Thoroughly wash the mussels, pulling off all beards, and scraping
  shells as necessary. Place in saucepan with wine. Cover tightly and
  steam until the shells open (don't overcook or they will become
  rubbery). Remove mussels with a slotted spoon, leaving the wine broth
  in the pan. While the mussels cool a bit, put wine broth over medium
  heat and add garlic, olive oil, pepper, tomato, and basil. (Use less
  oil to make this low-fat dish even lower in fat). Simmer until
  mixture reduces to about 2/3 or half its original volume. While it is
  simmering, remove the mussels from their shells. When sauce has
  reduced, add mussels to sauce, and simmer another minute. Pour sauce
  over hot linguini or fettucini and serve!
  
  This was a great low-fat dinner, and served with a boston lettuce
  salad with an olive oil/balsamic vinegar/fresh basil/ground pepper
  dressing was just fabulous! You could use shrimp instead of mussels
  for a different version too.

  Belsinger and Dille write: "Pepper's pungency plays off the flavors of
  starches and mild meats especially well. For a vegetarian version of
  pasta with pepper, toss hot pasta with the Spicy Butter with Four
  Peppercorns, some lemon juice, and chopped savory or parsley; serve
  with Parmesan."

      1 tb Vegetable oil
           Salt\pepper
 
  PREPARATION:  Make the Egg Pasta dough; roll as thin as possible. For
  farfalle, cut dough into 1-inch wide strips; then cut each strip into
  2 inch long pieces. Pinch each piece to form a bow-tie. OR cut dough
  into 1/8-inch wide strips for linguine.
  
  For The Pesto, grate the cheese.  Mash the garlic with the salt to
  form a smooth paste.  Combine the garlic paste, basil, pine nuts, and
  olive oil in food processor or blender. Puree until smooth. Stir in
  the cheese. NOTE: Can be made to this point several hours ahead.
  
  COOKING AND SERVING:  Heat the grill or broiler.  Toss the chicken
  with vegetable oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil or grill
  the chicken, turning once, until just cooked through, about 10
  minutes total. Cut into bite-size pieces. Cook pasta in boiling,
  salted water until tender, about 3 minutes for fresh pasta. Drain and
  return to pot. Toss with chicken and pesto sauce and season with salt
  and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 oz Fusilli or other fresh pasta
      6 oz Mushrooms
           Fresh basil, parsley, chives

MMMMM---------------------FOR THE MEATBALLS--------------------------
      1 lb Lean freshly minced pork
           Parmesan cheese
           Fresh basil
           Garlic
    1/2 sm Egg; lightly beaten
           A little butter or oil

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE SAUCE----------------------------
    1/2 oz Butter
  1 1/2 tb Plain flour
    1/4 pt Double cream
    1/2 pt (scant) stock
           Parmesan cheese
           Dijon mustard
 
  Mix all the meatball ingredients thoroughly; I season the meat with 1
  tablespoon grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons basil and 1 smallish garlic
  clove, as well as salt and pepper. Flour your hands and shape the
  mixture into about 32 small balls.  Fry in batches in a non-stick pan
  for 5 minutes or more until golden and cooked right through. Shake
  the pan frequently so the meatballs keep in good shape and cook
  evenly. Transfer to a casserole and keep hot.
  
      Slice the mushrooms thickly, saute' them well and add them to the
  meatballs.  Then "wash out" the frying pan with the chicken stock.
  Make a smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock and cream. Add
  any juices that have collected in the casserole and simmer for
  several minutes. Away from the heat, season with salt and pepper, 2
  tablespoons Parmesan and 1 heaped teaspoon Dijon mustard. Pour the
  sauce over the meatballs, cover and keep hot in a low oven.  The
  mixture can be kept hot for some time without spoiling, or it can be
  prepared ahead and reheated close to serving.
  
      Boil the pasta until al dente and drain well.  Add it to the
  casserole together with a small handful of fresh herbs -- about 2
  tablespoons each basil and chives, and 1 of parsley -- and toss
  gently to mix well. Garnish with more basil, and serve with an
  undressed salad.

   Prick the eggplant in a few places with a knife. Place on a baking
  sheet and roast for about 40 minutes, turning occasionally for even
  cooking, until the eggplant is tender but not falling apart. When the
  eggplant is cool enough to handle, peel it and dice the pulp. Place
  the pulp in a colander to drain away any bitter juices. Discard the
  skin.
  
   Bring a largepot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the pasta and
  stir the eggplant and the rest of the ingredients and warm through.
  season to taste. Adjust salt, pepper, and hot red pepper. If the
  tomatoes are tart, add a pinch of sugar to compensate.  When the
  pasta is al dente, drain and toss with the sauce.
   Serve at once.

      Title: PASTA WITH ROASTED TOMATO & RED CHILE ARRAB
 Categories: Pasta, Sauces, Low-cal, Low-fat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Large, firm, ripe tomatoes
      1 lg Long, red, dried New Mexican
           -chile (about 1 1/2 ounces)
      1 tb Olive oil
      2 md Garlic cloves, chopped fine
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Dried oregano
  1 1/2 tb Fresh cilantro, chopped
           Cooked Pasta
 
  Preheat oven to 500. With a fork, pierce the tomatoes near their stem
  ends. Put them in a baking pan lined with aluminum foil. Put the
  chile in a separate foil-lined pan. Put both pans in the oven. Roast
  the chile until it turns evenly dark brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove it
  from the oven and set it aside. Continue roasting the tomatoes until
  their skins are evenly blackened, about 45 minutes. With your hands,
  split open the chile and remove its stem and seeds. Break its flesh
  and skin into a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Pulse the
  machine on and off several times until the chile is finely chopped.
  Add the tomatoes to the processor, including their skins and any
  juices that have collected in the pan. Pulse the machine until the
  tomatoes are chopped to a coarse puree. In a large saucepan or
  skillet, heat the oil with the garlic over moderate heat. When the
  garlic begins to brown, add the tomato-chile mixture and stir in the
  sugar and olive oregano. Simmer until thick but still slightly
  liquid, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cilantro and serve over cooked
  pasta.

  *Cut into very thin strips (soften in hot water if dry packed).
  
  **Cooked according to package directions.
  
  Wash the fresh vegetables and pat dry.  Do not peel or cut. Rub them
  with some of the olive oil and place them on a well-oiled baking
  sheet. Bake at 450 F. until the skins are browned and the insides are
  softened. Remove vegetables from the oven as soon as they're done,
  letting the rest cook as long as needed; the onions and garlic will
  require 30 to 40 minutes.
  
  While the vegetables are roasting, heat 1 1/2 cups of the stock to
  boiling, pour it over the sun-dried tomatoes, and let them stand.
  When the vegetables are cool, squeeze the garlic cloves from their
  skins, remove the skin from the onions and peppers, and seed and core
  the peppers. Roughly chop the vegetables.
  
  Place chopped vegetables in a large skillet that has been coated with
  olive oil and heat, stirring often. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and
  their soaking liquid, rosemary, sweet marjoram (or oregano), parsley,
  cumin, coriander, capers and tequila.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat,
  and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until very flavorful. Add more
  stock if needed to thin the sauce.  When nearly ready to serve, add
  vanilla extract and sliced zucchini to the sauce, cooking just until
  brightly colored. Season with salt and pepper. Serve over the pasta,
  tossing lightly; garnish with cilantro, nuts and grated cheese.
  
  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

      Title: PASTA WITH VEGETABLES
 Categories: Pasta, Low-fat, Vegetarian
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      6 oz Pasta, non-egg, your choice
           (I like Rotelle for this)
      1 ea Yellow onion, largeish
      1 ea Green Bell pepper
      6 ea Mushrooms, medium
      1 ea Zuccini squash
      1 cn Hunt's "Light" fat-free
           Spaghetti Sauce (26.75 oz)
      1 ea Weight Watcher's brand
           Fat-free "Grated Parmesan
           Italian Topping"
 
  Start a pot of water on high for the pasta, and put a large non-stick
  skillet on medium high heat (no added lubrication.) When the water
  boils, dump the pasta in and look at the clock.
  
  Meanwhile, wash and cut up the veggies in the sequence given, dumping
  each into the skillet and stiring before going on to the next. The
  key to this recipe is to cut the vegetables into large enough chunks,
  and not to overcook them.  Cut onion into quarters, then slice about
  3/4 inch thick. Likewise for the pepper, removing stem, seeds, and
  soft parts. Cut mushrooms in half, or quarters if larger. Cut the
  zuke in half lengthwise, then slice 1/2 inch thick.
  
  When the pasta has boiled for 10 to 12 minutes, take it off and drain
  it. Check that the vegies are not still raw, then pour the can of
  sauce in with them. Divide the pasta onto serving plates while the
  sauce is heating. Stir the sauce, and when it's hot through, spoon
  over the pasta. Top generously to taste with the phony parmesan.
  
  Makes 2 large or 3 smaller servings.  Elapsed time under 20 minutes.
  Zero grams fat.

    100 g  Butter
    100 g  Cream cheese
      5    Eggs

  Put everything in the blender and combine well, but not to a perfectly
  smooth puree, there should be little chunks of corn discernible. Pour
  into a greased tin and bake for 1 hour in a medium oven. Serve with
  warmed syrup poured over it. This is light, yet substantial, and has
  a unique flavour. The syrup can be flavoured with cinnamon or vanilla
  too. The corn should be the sweetest and freshest available, since
  the recipe contains no additional sugar or starch other than what the
  corn provides.

    360 g  Quince paste, mixed with
    150 ml Of any sweet wine.
           Syrup:
    450 g  Sugar
    200 ml Water
           Vanilla essence
           Oil or vegetable shortening
           -for deep-frying
 
  To make the puff pastry: Cut the butter into the flour and salt until
  the consistency of crumbs. Gradually mix in the lemon juice and add
  the egg. Then, working the dough continuously with the fingers, add
  the water 3 tablespoons at a time. When all the water has been ab-
  sorbed and the dough is quite smooth, place it on a lightly floured
  surface and knead it for about 10-15 minutes until smooth and
  elastic. Leave to rest 20-30 minutes, covered with a dry tea towel.
  Roll out the dough thinly, to about 80 cm square. Brush the surface
  with some of the melted butter, dust it with flour and smooth the
  flour evenly into the butter with the hand. Fold the dough in half
  and repeat the buttering and flouring process. Then repeat the
  process twice more (4 times in all) until the dough is only 20 cm
  square. Roll out to about 40 cm square and trim to a perfect 39 cm
  square. Cut the dough into 36 x 6.5 cm squares.
  
  To assemble: Place about 1 teaspoon of quince filling in the centre
  of half the squares, then top each with another square at a 45-
  degree angle so you end up with an eight-pointed star, and press the
  dough around the filling to secure it firmly. Shape the pastelito
  into a flower by putting a forefinger in turn on each point of the
  star, pointing inwards to the centre, then use your thumb and middle
  ringer to pinch the adjoining points of the bottom square up around
  the forefinger. This is less complicated than it sounds.
  
  To make syrup: Heat the sugar and and water into a small saucepan,
  stirring until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved. Boil steadily
  without stirring for 5-10 minutes until glossy and thickened. Stir in
  a few drops of vanilla essence and keep warm.
  
  To deep fry: Put about 7-8 cms of oil or shortening in two deep pans
  or saucepans. Heat one pan on medium heat (to about 75 degrees C) and
  the other until it is hot (180 degrees C). Drop 2 or 3 paste- litos
  into the warm fat and fry for 3-4 minutes, basting once or twice,
  until the layers of puff pastry begin to separate and open up like a
  flower. Do not let colour, but rapidly remove the pastelitos to the
  pan of hot oil, and fry on both sides for about 2 minutes until
  golden brown. Drain the pastelitos on absorbent paper, then dip in
  the warm syrup and place on a serving plate. Serve at room
  temperature.

      Title: PASTINA-STUFFED AVOCADOS
 Categories: Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Ripe but firm avocados
    1/2 ts Saffron threads
      1 c  Pastina (6oz)
      2 c  Chicken stock (480ml)
      2    Fresh tomatoes, skinned,
           -seeded & chopped
      2 tb Diced onion
    1/4 c  Fresh parsley, chopped
      2    Green onions, sliced in
           -thin rounds
           Salt & pepper
    1/2 c  Vinaigrette (120ml)
 
  And, of course, there had to be an avocado recipe in the book...
  
  In El Salvador saffron rice is often served with avocado. I use
  pastina here as an alternative to both rice and couscous, and serve
  it cold, stuffed into avocado halves. You can use any favorite
  vinaigrette in this recipe.
  
  Heat 1/4 cup of chicken stock and steep threads 20 minutes. Cook
  pastina in chicken stock with diced onion and steeped saffron. When
  cooked, drain and mix well with remaining ingredients. Stuff avocado
  halves. Serve as main course at lunch or first course at dinner.

      Title: PASTITSIO
 Categories: Casseroles, Greek
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
  1 1/2 lb Ziti thick, uncut macaroni
           Salt
      2 c  Grated cheeses*
      6 tb Melted butter
      7    Eggs
      6 c  Saltsa Kima
      6 c  Medium Saltsa Aspri
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
      1 c  Bread crumbs
 
  *Note: Grated cheeses can be any combination of mizithra, kefalotyri
  (hard ricotta) or Romano cheeses. In a large pot, boil the ziti in
  salted water until almost tender. Drain thoroughly. In a large bowl,
  combine the macaroni, 1 1/2 cups of the grated cheeses, the butter,
  and 4 of the eggs, lightly beaten.
      Butter an 11" x 15" x 3" baking pan, and in it layer half the
  macaroni mixture.  Separate 2 of the eggs and combine the 2 egg
  whites plus 1 more whole egg with the Saltsa Kima. Spread it evenly
  over the macaroni in the pan and cover with the remaining macaroni.
  Meanwhile, combine the Saltsa Aspri with the 2 egg yolks and the
  spices. Pour over the macaroni, spreading it into the corners with a
  spatula. Sprinkle the top lightly with the remaining cheese and the
  bread crumbs. Bake in a 350 degree for 45 minutes or until a golden
  crust develops and the sauce bubbles. Remove from the oven and allow
  to stand for 15 minutes before cutting into squares. Serve on a warm
  platter. Note: Try this once using 1 1/2 pounds of ziti for an
  elegant pastitsio. A very rich recipe; you can safely reduce the meat
  sauce and Saltsa Aspri by one cup, if desired. From: "The Food of
  Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles.

      Title: PASULJ (SERBIAN BEAN SOUP)
 Categories: Soups/stews, Beans, Polish
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      1 lb Dried white beans (navy or
           -cannellini)
      2    Onions, chopped
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      3    Bay leaves
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      2 tb Tomato paste
      1 lg Carrot, scraped and sliced
      5    To 6 whole peppercorns
      1 lb Kielbasa, thickly sliced
    1/2 tb Salt
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Paprika
      2 tb Flour
 
  You will need a large saucepan.  Pick over the beans for bits of grit
  and chaff, and rinse them twice in cold water. Put the beans in a
  large saucepan and cover them with water to a depth of 1 to 2 inches.
  Bring the water to a boil and then turn down the heat. Leave to
  simmer gently for half an hour.
  
  Remove the pan from the heat and pour in enough cold water to cover
  the beans to a depth of 3 inches.  The beans will settle on the
  bottom. Leave them for a minute or two; then pour off the water and
  replace with fresh water.  Bring the water to a boil and then turn
  down the heat to simmer.
  
  Add the onions, garlic, bay leaves, parsley, tomato paste, carrot, and
  peppercorns to the beans.  Cook gently over very low heat for 1 1/2
  to 2 hours, until the beans are soft. After 45 minutes of the
  cooking, add the kielbasa.
  
  Fifteen minutes before you are ready to serve, add the salt and
  prepare a liaison for the soup.  Heat the oil until it is smoking
  lightly; then quickly stir in the paprika, followed by the flour. Mix
  to a thin paste. Add this to the soup, stirring well.  Simmer for 5
  minutes, until the soup is thick and rich.
  
  Serve with plenty of bread and good red wine.
  
  Serves 5 to 6. Time: 2 to 2 1/2 hours

    1/8 ts Salt
      1 pn Pepper, black

MMMMM--------------------------DOUGH 1-------------------------------
    2/3 c  Flour, all-purpose
      1 ea Egg yolk
      2 tb Sour cream
    1/4 c  Water

MMMMM--------------------------DOUGH 2-------------------------------
    2/3 c  Flour, all-purpose
      9 tb Butter/margarine; room temp
 
    DOUGH 1: In a medium bowl, combine flour, egg yolk, sour cream and
  water. Work into a soft elastic dough. Knead 15-20 minutes. Cover,
  set aside.
    DOUGH 2: In a medium bowl, combine flour, butter into a smooth soft
  dough. Divide dough into 3 balls. Cover dough balls, set aside.
    On a lightly floured board roll out DOUGH 1 into a rectangle about
  1/4 inch thick. Place 1 ball of DOUGH 2 on center of rolled dough
  rectangle. Gently press dough ball with your hands or rolling pin
  until dough ball is 1/4 inch thick and covers a circular portion of
  DOUGH 1. Fold up both short sides of DOUGH 1 over rolled DOUGH 2 so
  ends meet in center. Re-roll resulting dough combination into a
  rectangle 1/4 inch thick. Repeat with remaining 2 balls of DOUGH 2.
  Roll dough jelly-roll style. Wrap dough in foil; refrigerate
  overnight.
    Halve dough crosswise.  On a lightly floured board, roll out 1/2 of
  dough into a rectangle 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick. Using a round 2 inch
  cutter, cut dough rounds. Arrange 16 rounds on greased baking sheet,
  allowing room for spreading. Press leftover dough scraps into a ball.
  Roll to same thickness; cut as many dough rounds as possible. Repeat
  r process with remaining dough until a total of 48 rounds are cut.
    With a 1 inch round cutter, cut out centers of 32 dough rounds not
  on baking sheets, forming doughnut shapes. Using a pastry brush,
  apply beaten egg white to top surface of 1 uncut dough round on
  baking sheet. Carefully postion 1 doughnut cutout directly on top of
  brushed dough round. Lightly press doughnut cutout down with your
  fingertips. Brush egg white on top of doughnut cutout. Place a second
  doughnut cutout on top of the first. Pat lightly with your fingers.
    Repeat process until all dough rounds on baking sheet have 2
  doughnut cutouts glued on. Brush beaten egg yolk on top of doughnut
  cutouts. Bake 15 minutes or until golden; let cool. Melt butter in
  skillet, add mushrooms, saute until nearly tender. In bowl, combine
  half and half, flour, salt, pepper; stir mixture into sauteed
  mushrooms. Simmer 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. FIll each doughnut
  round with about 1 teastpoon of cooled mushroom mixture. Bake 8-10
  minutes. Serve hot.

    1/4 c  Safflower oil
    1/4 c  Soy oil
    1/4 c  Peanut oil
      3 tb Balsamic vinegar

  1 1/2 tb Crumbled blue cheese
      1 ts Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Dry mustard
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Dried basil leaves
 
  Pat Piper or Sonoma, California, sends us her recipe rather
  assertively called Pat's Famous and Healthful Low-Cholesterol Salad
  Dressing. She first tried a balancing act of 1 to 1 (equal parts oil
  and vinegar). But overly tart results pushed her back to traditional
  ratios of 3 (oil) to 1 (vinegar).
  She then elected to combine predominantly monounsaturated olive oil
  with three significantly polyunsaturated vegetable oils, hoping to
  bring better nutrition by way of variety. Liking the concept of
  variety, she also combined several vinegars.
  =======================================================
  ============== ===
  In a small bowl or jar, whisk or shake together olive oil, safflower
  oil, soy oil, peanut oil, balsamic vinegar, cider vinegar, garlic,
  blue cheese, soy sauce, dry mustard, pepper, and basil. Makes about 1
      1/3    cups.

      Title: PAT'S FAMOUS PASTA SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Large pot!
 
      4 qt Tomatoes
      1    30 oz jar Spaghetti Sauce
      1 cn 20 oz tomato sauce
      3 cn Tomato paste
      4 tb Italian seasoning
    1/2 ts Ground sage
      2 ts Garlic powder or salt
      1 tb Oregano
      1 ts Parsley
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Romano cheese, grated
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
 
  NOTE: It is best to use fresh canned tomatoes and when you use the
  spaghetti sauce, the thicker the better (we use Prego). In a very
  LARGE pot, using a vegetable mill, grind tomatoes to remove seeds and
  hard pulp. Pour the tomato sauce and spaghetti sauce in the mill, and
  process it.If the tomatoes you added were watery, you might want to
  add a second jar/can of spaghetti sauce. Clean the jars out with
  water. The point you are trying to do is to retain as much of the
  essence of the ground whole tomatoes as possible. Discard the debris.
  Add the tomato paste directly to the tomato mixture. (Note, clean the
  cans of paste as best as possible... you want them to be very clean.)
  Mix well. Salt and pepper to taste. Add all spices and the cheeses
  and mix well. Cover and place on very low heat. If you wish to add
  meatballs to the sauce while it is cooking now is the time to make
  them. Once made, add them directly to the sauce. As it cooks you may
  want to adjust the spices and the cheeses depending on your tastes.
  We add at least another tablespoon of oregano, 2 table- spoons of
  parsley, a little more salt, and at least another 1/2 cup each of
  romano and parmesan cheeses. Stir every half hour or so to prevent
  scorching on the bottom of the pot. When the sauce is cooked down to
  your taste (and the meatballs are done to your liking), remove from
  heat and let sit for 1/2 hour.

 Categories: Cyberealm, Kooknet, Cakes, Mom's best, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
  1 1/3 c  Buttermilk or sour milk
    1/2 c  Shortening, butter or..
           ..margarine
      1 ts Vanilla
      4    Egg whites
 
  Preheat oven to 350F. In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder,
  baking soda, and 1/8 tsp. salt. Add buttermilk, shortening (butter or
  margarine) and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping
  bowl. Beat on medium to high speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl
  occasionally. ADd egg whites and beat for 2 minutes more, scraping
  bowl.
  
  Pour into 2 greased and floured 9 x 1/5 inch round baking pans. Bake
  for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool on wire
  racks for 10 minutes. Loosen sides and remove from pans. Serves 12.
  
  NOTE: One day my husband Pat wanted a marble cake. So, I improvised.
  To make a marble cake from this recipe, simply reserve one third of
  the cake batter before putting in the cake pans. Then, melt one
  square unsweetened or semi-sweet chocolate either over boiling water
  or in the microwave oven. Stir to blend. Add to the cake mixture and

      Title: PATCHOULI
 Categories: Info, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
  "One mint [Family: Lamiaceae (Labiatae)] relative that's not so well
  known in temperate North America (though it has been grown here at
  least since 1900) is patchouli, two species of which (Pogostemon
  cablin and P. heyneanus) are increasingly seen in the catalogs of
  herb nurseries these days.
  
  "The genus Pogostemon consists of some 30 or 40 species of shrubs,
  subshrubs, and herbaceous plants native to tropical Asia. The name
  means 'bearded thread' in Greek and refers to the hairy middles of
  the four stamens.  Other characteristics of the genus include flowers
  in whorls in the upper leaf axils; a tubular, five-toothed calyx; a
  tubular corolla with four nearly equal lobes, and one style with two
  stigmas. The fruits are four seedlike nutlets.
  
  "The name patchouli comes from a Tamil word, paccilai, meaning 'green
  leaf.'  An alternate common name seen in some older references is
  pucha-pat."
  
  "The species of patchouli commonly available in the United States are
  P. cablin and P. heyneanus, also known as P. patchouli or P.
  patchouly. The latter is sometimes known as smooth or Java patchouli.
  Both are shrubby plants which may grow 3 feet tall under optimal
  conditions. The green leaves are roughly egg-shaped, up to 4 inches
  long, deeply veined, and notched.  Flowers of P. cablin are white,
  while those of P. heyneanus are tinged with purplish pink. They have
  little fragrance.
  
                               - Uses -
  
  "Patchouli is known principally for the fragrance of its essential
  oil. As one writer has rhapsodized, 'Fine patchouli has a winelike,
  ethereal quality, deep and woody, spicy, almost dry and earthy.' Even
  those who don't care for the fragrance of the oil may find the scent
  of the fresh leaves quite pleasant.
  
  "Patchouli oil is used extensively in the perfume industry. Major
  producers include China, Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Brazil, and the
  Seychelles. The oil is steam-distilled from the leaves and stems,
  which are harvested two to three times a year, and the quality of the
  oil is better if the dried leaves are aged before distillation."
  
  "Other herbal fragrances that are sometimes blended with patchouli
  include basil, bergamot, geranium, juniper, lavender, myrrh, neroli,
  pine, sandalwood, and rose. Commercial perfumes that contain
  patchouli include Tabu, Bill Blass, and Polo.
  
  "Patchouli is frequently used in soaps and cosmetics that are said to
  rejuvenate dry and 'mature' skin.  It works as a deodorant by masking
  body odor.  Both the oil and the dried leaves are used in potpourri,
  the leaves adding a distinctive texture as well as fragrance to the
  mixture. The oil is thought to have fixative properties and is
  believed to improve with age.
  
  "Patchouli is not widely used as a medicinal herb; its use may cause
  loss of appetite or sleep and 'nervous attacks.' Still, some Eastern
  cultures esteem it as a prophylactic. Aromatherapists consider
  patchouli an aphrodisiac based on the widely held belief that the
  odor stimulates the pituitary gland to release endorphins, chemicals
  that kill pain and promote euphoria as well as sexual feelings.  They
  recommend patchouli for external use to treat anxiety, at least in
  small doses; too much can be sedative."
  
  "Patchouli has culinary and industrial uses, too.  The fresh leaves
  of P. cablin are used as a seasoning, and the dried leaves of P.
  heyneanus (the less fragrant of the two species) flavor an alcoholic
  beverage. The oil of P. cablin flavors chewing gum, baked goods, and
  candy, and that of P. heyneanus has been used in India ink.
  
  "Cashmere shawls imported into France during Napoleon's reign were
  packed in boxes filled with dried patchouli herb to repel insects.
  European copies of the shawls failed to sell until manufacturers
  realized that the exotic scent was part of the shawls' attraction.
  
  "Cotton balls saturated with patchouli oil and placed among stored
  clothing can substitute for the dried leaves as a moth repellent.
  Mixing equal parts of dried patchouli leaves and finely ground dried
  pyrethrum flowers (which have no aroma) may increase the repellent's
  effectiveness. Patchouli oil has also been used to repel silverfish
  and bookworms from books."

      Title: PATE A LA RAPTURE  <RAPPIE PIE>
 Categories: Chicken, Canadian, Historical, Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Peck potatoes
      2    Chickens (3 or 3 1/2 lbs
           Each)
      3 lg Onions
    1/4 lb Butter
      6    Strips bacon
           Salt & pepper to taste
           Poultry seasoning
 
  You will need a grater, a large pan (17"x12"x2"), and a sturdy cloth
  bag. Simmer the chickens in a pot on top of the stove with plenty of
  onions and seasonings. When cooked, separate the meat from the bones
  and chop meat into pieces.  Save the broth.
  
  Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and soak in cold water. Grate about 10
  potatoes at a time and then place them in a cloth bag.  Squeeze
  tightly until all the water and starch is removed.  Do all the
  potatoes this way.
  
  Save the liquid from the potatoes: measure it. You must measure an
  equal amount of chicken broth to replace the potato water. When the
  potatoes are all squeezed, loosen them in a large pan and gradually
  add the measured chicken broth, stirring slowly. The potatoes may
  take on a jelly-like appearance. Be sure there are no lumps. Add
  seasonings and stir, stir, stir!
  
  Cover the bottom of a well-greased pan with half the potato mixture.
  Arrange chicken pieces, chopped onion, and pats of butter on top.
  Cover with the other half of the potato mixture.  Then add a bit of
  chopped onion, more pats of butter and six strips of bacon. This will
  form the crust.  Place pie in a hot (400F) oven for about 2 hours, or
  until a brown crust is formed.
  
  Delicious with applesauce or cranberry sauce.
  
  Serves 12.

      Title: PATE DE CAMPAGNE (COUNTRY PORK PATE)
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 tb Butter
      1    Onion; chopped
    1/2 lb Ground lean pork
    1/2 lb Ground pork fat
    1/2 lb Ground veal
    1/2 lb Pork or chicken liver, finel
           -y chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, peeled
           Pinch of ground cloves
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
           Pinch of ground nutmeg
      2    Eggs; beaten to mix
      2 tb Brandy
           Salt
           Pepper
    1/2 lb Bacon slices
 
  Melt butter in a small saute pan and cook onion over low heat until
  soft but not brown, 10-15 minutes. Leave to cool. In a food
  processor, puree the pork, pork fat, veal, pork or chicken liver,
  garlic, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, eggs,  cooked onion, brandy, salt
  and pepper. Divide the mixture in half if it does not all fit
  comfortably in the machine. Saute a small piece of mixture and taste
  for seasoning. It should be highly seasoned. If not, add more salt
  and pepper. Set oven at 350F. Line the sides and base of a 1-quart
  terrine mold with bacon, reserving 2 slices. Pack pork mixture in the
  mold and smooth the top. Cut remaining bacon in thin strips and
  arrange in a lattice on top of the pate. Cook the pate, uncovered,
  ion a water bath until done when  tested with a skewer, 1.1/4 to
  1.1/2 hours. Let pate cool to  tepid.  Insert a board that fits
  inside the rim of the terrine. Distribute weights on top and chill.
  Serve pate from the mold, and cut in slices at the table. The pate
  should be made at least 48 hours ahead so that the  flavours mellow.
  It can be kept up to 5 days in the refrigerator. Variations:  Pate de
  porc solgnote (Pork pate with Hazelnuts) Add 1 cup toasted peeled
  hazelnuts to the pork mixture. Pate de Pork Marbree (Marbled Pork
  Pate)  Roll each chicken liver in very thinly sliced pork fat or fat
  bacon. Make pate mixture without livers. Pack half of the mixture
  into the mold and place livers down the center. Cover with remaining
  mixture and bake. When sliced, the pate is marbled with liver
  outlined in fat. Source: Classic french Cooking

 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Fish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------FOR THE BOIL-----------------------------
     40 lb Live crawfish
      1 c  Salt
    1/2 c  Ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Ground red pepper
    1/2 c  Ground black pepper
      5 lb Small white onions
     12 ea Ears of corn, shucked
      5 lb Small new potatoes

MMMMM--------------------------SPRINKLE-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Ground red pepper
    1/2 c  Ground black pepper
      2 c  Salt
 
  Alex Patout describes Crawfish as "a delicacy made for sharing-- in
  fact, in Cajun country, boiling crawfish for only two people counts
  as a venial sin." Wash the crawfish well and pick out any fish bones
  or other debris. Fill a great big (40-quart) Stockpot a quarter full
  of water. Add the salt and peppers and bring to boil. Add the whole
  onions, the corn, and the new potatoes (it will be easy to remove
  them later if you put them in a cloth sack).  Return to boil, cover,
  lower heat to medium, and let cook for 8 minutes.  Add crawfish,
  cover again and raise heat to high. After steam begins to escape from
  under the lid, cook 7 minutes more. Remove from heat and let sit for
  4 minutes. Do *NOT* remove the lid until this point!
      Remove the onions, corn, and potatoes to a bowl and drain the
  crawfish. Place the crawfish in a large insulated container (an ce
  chest works well, as do the thick waterproof boxes chickens are
  shipped in, which your butcher may give you for free).  Have your
  *SPRINKLE* ready and sprinkle over the crawfish and mix them well to
  coat. Cover and let sit for 7 minutes.
      Serve immediately with the onions, corn, new potatoes, and lots of
  French bread on a large table covered with plenty of paper. When
  everyone has eaten his fill, everyone "peels for the house." The
  peeled tails can then be used in cold crawfish cocktail or salad or
  for Fried Crawfish the next day. Serves 8-10 NOTE: Most of the salt

      1 pk Dark choc cake mix
           Or
      1    Recipe 9 x 13 chocolate
           Cake( I used this as I dont
           Care for mixes )
           Or yellow or butter cake
      1    14 oz can sweetened
           Condensed milk ( not
           Evaporated )
           ( I use about 1/2 can )
      1    16 0z jar butterscotch ice
           Cream topping
      1    8 0z cool whip
           I use 12 oz whipped topping
      3    Heath  candy bars ( crushed
           In the wrappers )
           1.4 oz each ( English toffee
           And milk chocolate )
           Chocolate jimmies(sprinkles)
 
  Comment: I have no idea why the cake is called a Paul Newman Chocolate
  cake.My family knows it as a heath bar cake. Call it what you wish.
  It's a splendid cake. I use a favorite chocolate cake scratch recipe.
  My daughter uses the mixes.  Prepare cake for 9 x 13 pan and bake and
  completely cool. If using mix follow pkg directions. Or prepare your
  favorite scratch yellow, butter or chocolate cake recipe. I place the
  batter into 2, 9 or 10 inch round cake pans since I vary the recipe
  for a layer cake and not a
        9 x  13 pan kind.
  
  When completely cool: Using large blunt end of a chop stick, poke
  holes all over cake and pour the condensed milk over cake ( 1 can was
  just to much for the layer cake and 1/2 can was sufficient) . But try
  the entire jar if you wish for the 9 x 13 pan. Then spread over the
  caramel topping ( used whole jar ) and spread evely with the Cool
  Whip. For the layers, use whipped topping to frost entire cake and
  not in between layers. Sprinkle top of cake with the crushed candy (
  helps to chill bars first then crush ). I sprinkled top of each layer
  with the crushed candy bars plus reserved some extra to sprinkle over
  the whipped topping. Chill cake for several hours ( I prepared mine a
  day ahead ) before slicing. This is an extremely moist cake from all
  that milk and caramel. I also used some chocolate jimmies to decorate
  the cake. If you love chocolate this is probably one of the most
  delicious cakes to try. It also came out extremely delicious with the
  yellow or butter cake recipes. But the chocolate is extra special.
  
  Note: with layer cake:  some of the caramel will ooze out of the
  layers as you spread it on layers and this is just fine.It adds to
  the attractiveness of the cake. Work quickly to frost and cover the
  entire cake with the whipped topping and throw on jimmies and crushed
  heath bars all over the cake including sides. Then immediately chill
  to set the caramel etc. The cake tastes best when allowed to chill
  over night.

      Title: PAULO LUIGI'S PASTA FAGIOLI
 Categories: Soups, Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb White beans (Navy or
           -Northern)
      2 tb -4 tbsp. olive oil
      1 md Onion; chopped fine
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      4    -5 fresh basil leaves
      2 tb Tomato paste
      1 tb Flour
           Black pepper
      1    Crushed red pepper
           Salt
      1 pk Tubetti or Rottel noodles
           -(12 oz pkg.)
 
   This recipe was handed down to me from my mother. It can be made with
  canned beans to save time.  Use 4 cans to 1 pound dried. Soak beans
  overnight in a 5 quart pot (kettle), in twice as much water as beans.
  The next day drain the beans, add fresh water just covering the beans
  and boil until beans are cook (1 1/2 hours). Water level must remain
  above the beans. Stir occasionally, for best results use a wooden
  spoon. Keep beans warm. Generously coat a frying pan with olive oil.
  Add onion and saute until translucent. Add garlic and basil leaves.
  Saute 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add 1 tablespoon flour and
  cook for one minute. Add 1/2 cup water, stir until thickened (1-2
  minutes). Add tomato paste, stir until dissolved.  Remove from heat
  and add to still warm beans. For desired thickness add water.  Stir
  until mixed, adding peppers and salt to taste. Simmer over low heat
  for 15 minutes stirring occasionally. Cook pasta al dente (4-5
  minutes). Drain and cool. Set aside. Before serving, place pasta in
  the bottom of a soup bowl. Add hot bean mixture. Mix and garnish with
  parsley. Serves 6-8.

      Title: PAUPIETTES DE BANANES AUX JAMBON
 Categories: Appetizers, French
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Bananas (fairly unripe,
           -but not green)
      4 sl Ham
      6 tb Parmesan cheese, grated
    1/2 c  Double cream
           -(whipping cream)
           Paprika
           Salt and pepper
 
  Peel bananas, sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika (be generous with
  this). Wrap a slice of ham around each banana. Place bananas in a
  greased, oven-proof dish and pour cream over them. Sprinkle the
  Parmesan cheese on top.  Bake at 400 degrees F. for 20 minutes or
  until golden brown. Serve cold (but not refrigerated).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Bananas with ham and paprika -- This comes from the "Vogue French
  Cookery Book." It seems to go down rather well as an appetizer,
  although it would make a nice supper snack, I suppose.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: PAUPIETTES DE BOEUF
 Categories: Crockpot, Meats, Main dish, Beef
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter, margarine
      2    Onions, medium; peeled and
           Minced finely
    1/2 lb Mushrooms; fresh, minced
      1 tb Lemon rind; grated
      2 tb Bread crumbs; unflavored
    1/2 c  Parsley; fresh, minced
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      2    Eggs; slightly beaten
      1 lb Bottom round of beef; cut
           Into 16 thin slices, each
           4 inches square
           Salt,pepper,thyme-grnd,flour
      4 tb Butter or margarine
      1 c  Water, warm
      2    Garlic cloves; medium,
           Peeled and crushed
      2 tb Mustard;White Dijon,prepared
 
  To Cook:  In a heavy skillet, over medium-low heat, melt 2
  tablespoons of butter and saute the onion and mushrooms until the
  onion is translucent. Stir in the lemon rind, bread crumbs, parsley,
  1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  When the parsley has
  wilted ~ about 1 minute after you add it to the skillet - quickly
  stir in the eggs to bind the mixture and remove skillet from the heat
  at once.  Set aside. With a rolling pin or a wooden mallet, flatten
  the beef pieces until each is very thin and about twice its original
  size. As you finish each piece, season it with a little salt, pepper,
  and a pinch of thyme. At the widest end of each beef slice, place 1
  teaspoon of bread-crumb mixture from the skillet. Roll up the meat,
  sausage-shape, and secure it with a wooden toothpick through the
  center. Roll each piece in flour. In a very large skillet, over
  medium- high heat, melt 4 tablespoons of butter and brown the pieces
  of beef. As you finish, place them in the slow-cooker. Pour the water
  into the skillet; scrape up the pan juices and turn the sauce into
  the cooker. Cover and cook on Low for about 5 hours. Before serving:
  About half an hour before serving, mix the garlic and mustard into
  the sauce around the beef; cover; turn the heat to High, and cook for
  30 minutes. If the sauce seems less flavorful than you like, about 5
  minutes before serving add a dab of prepared mustard and a little
  salt.  If the sauce seems thin, leave the cover off during the second
  cooking period.

           -(at room temperature)
      1 c  Sugar, castor
      1 tb Vinegar
           Cornflour
 
  With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form,
  then gradually add the sugar (about 1 t every 30 seconds). This will
  take around 15 minutes. Beat until firm. Add the vinegar. When
  combined, turn out onto a flat baking sheet that has been greased and
  dusted with cornflour. Shape it so that there will be a hollow in the
  centre to hold the fruit.
  
  Cook in a pre-heated, warm oven (350-375 degrees F.) for 10 minutes,
  then at 200-250 degrees F. for 40-50 mins.
  
  When cooked, turn the oven off and allow to cool slowly in the oven
  for at least an hour, preferably overnight. Gradual cooling is
  important. Serve cold, topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit such
  as strawberries, bananas and kiwi fruit.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pavlova (Australian meringue dessert) -- This is a quintessentially
  Australian dish.  The legend behind it is that it was created by a
  chef in Adelaide after he had seen Anna Pavlova dance, saying that he
  wanted to create a dessert that was as light and airy as her dancing.
  
  Australians pride themselves on their ability to cook a good Pavlova.
  When important visitors come to an Australian household, they are
  likely to be served a Pavlova with plenty of fresh fruit. There are
  many variations on the recipe. This one comes from my friend Janet
  Wiles. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  Castor sugar is known in North America as "granulated sugar."
  Cornflour is likewise "cornstarch." The higher temperature initially
  is to form a crust on the outside of the meringue base, it should be
  crisp on the outside, though not browned, and soft inside. It's
  important that the beaters and the bowl are really dry and clean.
  Uneven temperatures will cause the base to collapse (keep the oven
  door closed and let it cool slowly).  Experienced Pavlova cooks claim
  that electric ovens work best because they heat more uniformly.

     10 oz Caster sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla essence

      1 ts Orange flavoured liqueur

      1 lb Fresh fruit salad
 
  Draw a 9" circle on a baking sheet, preheat oven to to a cool 150øC or
  300øF.
  
  Beat egg whites until stiff. Add 4 oz of the sugar and continue
  beating for one minute or until the mixture is stiff and glossy.
  
  Fold in remaining sugar, cornflour, vanilla and vinegar.
  
  Spoon 1/3 of the meringue mixture onto the baking sheet and spread
  out into the shape of the circle. Put remainder of the mixture in a
  piping bag and pipe around the edge of the circle.
  
  Bake for 1 1/2 hours (yes 90 minutes) or until firm and very lightly
  browned. Allow to cool completely.
  
  Whip the cream and fold in the sugar and the liqueur. Fill the
  meringue case with the cream, and then pile the fruit salad in the
  centre on top of it.
  
  Pavlova is a traditional Australian dessert. It is essentially a
  meringue base, filled with fresh fruit salad and cream, and is served
  with ice cream, jelly and any other sweet goop that appeals at the
  time.
  
  There are many permutations, but the essence of the dish is the
  meringue shell filled with cream and then fruit salad.
  
  Here the fruit salad might consist of pineapple, passionfruit,
  strawberries, kiwi fruit, melons, all diced and mixed.
  
  Jelly here is what I think Jello is in the US.

      Title: PAVLOVA II
 Categories: Desserts, Australian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lg Egg whites
      1 c  Sugar, castor
      1 ts Cornflour
      1 ts Vinegar
      1 ts Vanilla flavour
 
  Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.  With an electric mixer beat the egg
  whites until soft peaks form,  then gradually add the sugar. Beat
  until firm.
  
  Add the cornflour, vinegar and vanilla.  When combined, turn out onto
  a flat tray that has been greased and dusted with cornflour. Try a
  circular shape with slightly more mixture at the edges so that it may
  be served by placing goodies in its centre depression.
  
  Cook in a pre-heated, cool (250 degrees F.) oven for one hour. When
  cooked, turn the oven off, leave the oven door slightly ajar, and
  allow to cool slowly in the oven. This slow cooling works to prevent
  the loss of too much height. Serve cold, with whipped cream and fresh
  fruit pieces, strawberries and kiwi fruit for example.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Australian meringue dessert.
  
  *  Cornflour is known in North America as cornstarch. Castor sugar is
  known there as granulated sugar.
  
  *  Make sure that you start off with a clean bowl and beat the egg
  whites well.  A bowl with smooth sides (glass, metal) will help the
  eggs to whip up. A plastic bowl with scratches prevents the eggs from
  attaining a very light texture. Also ensure that the sugar is fully
  dissolved before going on to the next step. I have never had troubles
  from over-whipping. The final texture should be meringue on the
  inside with a thin crust on the outside.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.

      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
  2 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      6 tb Margarine
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Skim milk
    1/4 c  Creamy peanut butter
      2 ts ;water, very cold (approx.)
      2    Egg whites; lightly beaten
           Sesame seeds; optional
 
  1. Combine flour, sugar and salt. With a pastry blender or a fork,
  cut in the margarine until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs.
  
  2. Beat egg in a small bowl. Stir in milk and peanut butter (mixture
  will be lumpy). Add egg mixture to flour mixture; stir. Stir in the
  water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the dough forms a ball.
  
  3. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough for 3 minutes. Roll
  dough out to a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Cut into desired shapes with
  a cookie cutter. Brush with beaten egg whites and, if desired,
  sprinkle with sesame seeds.
  
  4. Bake in a preheated 350'F oven until firm and golden, about 30
  minutes (reduce baking time if you rolled biscuits thinly).
  
  NOTE: These biscuits are best if they are air-dried for 3 or 4 days
  before being stored in a plastic bag or container.

           Rinse well and let soak in a

           Salted water with a few
        dr Liquid smoke for 3 or 4

  suppose}. Turn off heat.
  
  When peas are finished soaking, rinse well, add fresh water to bowl

  carrots. Bring to a rolling boil, add a few drops of liquid smoke,
  reduce to medium heat and let cook away for an hour or more. Add

  Lightly butter a 2-quart or slightly larger ovenproof baking dish. Set
  aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter the slices of
  bread on one side, using the 4 tablespoons butter. Cut each slice of
  bread in half on the diagonal, forming two triangles; arrange the
  pieces, buttered side down, on the bottom of the baking dish. Scatter
  the peach slices over and between the slices of bread. Beat the eggs,
  egg yolks and sugar-spice blend in a large mixing bowl for 3 to 4
  minutes, or until well blended. Whisk in the milk and heavy cream.
  Blend in the salt and vanilla. Pour the mixture over the bread. Let
  stand for 30 minutes. Place the dish of pudding in another baking
  dish, large enough to accommodate it. Pour enough warm water in the
  pan to rise a little less than halfway up the sides of the dish
  holding the pudding. Bake the entire assembly on a rack in the lower
  third of the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until just set.
  (A knife inserted 2 inches from the edge will emerge without any
  moist particles clinging to it.) Carefully remove the pudding dish
  from the water bath and place it on a cooling rack. Cut the pudding
  into squares and serve warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with a
  little confectioners' sugar if you like. Serves 8.

    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1    Egg, lg
      3 tb Amaretto-flavored nondairy
           -creamer
    1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract
           Light vegetable oil cooking
           Spray

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
      2 c  Fresh orange juice
      2 tb Orange liqueur
      8    Peaches, peeled and thinly
           -sliced
      1 ts Honey
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Orange zest
 
  Put the flour into a mixing bowl.  Make a well in the center of the
  flour and add the egg.  While whisking, pour in the nondairy creamer
  and then the skim milk. Continue to whisk until the batter is smooth
  and free of lumps, then whisk in the nutmeg and vanilla.  Cover the
  batter and set it aside for 30 minutes. Prehead an 8-inch nonstick
  crepe pan or a small, heavy nonstick frying pan for about 1 minute
  over medium-high heat. Spray it twice with the vegetable oil. Spoon
  just enough batter into the pan to form a thin layer over the bottom,
  about 3 tablespoons, and tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly.
  Cook the crepe for 1 to 2 minutes, just until the edge is firm and
  begins to separate from the bottom. Flip the crepe with a spatula and
  cook for 1 to 2 minutes more on the other side, until golden brown.
  Remove the crepe to a sheet of waxed paper. Continue the process,
  stacking the cooked crepes on the waxed paper, until 8 crepes have
  been made. For the filling, combine the orange juice, liqueur,
  peaches and honey in a medium frying pan.  Cook for about 10 minutes,
  until the liquid turns thick and syrupy. To assemble, lay a crepe on
  an individual serving plate. Mound 1/3 cup of the peach slices on the
  bottom half of each and flip the top half over. Spoon a tablespoon of
  the peach syrup over each and dust with cinnamon and orange zest.

      Title: PEACH LEAF STARTER
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 qt Fresh peach leaves, unpacked
      3 c  Water
      3    Baked potatoes, medium size
    1/2 c  Yellow corn meal
      3 tb Sugar
      2 ts Salt
 
  Bring water to rolling boil and steep peach leaves in it for 15
  minutes. Drain liquid and add enough water to make 3 full cups again.
  This will have a rather unappetizing green color but don't worry! It
  will disappear during the fermentation process.  Peel hot baked
  potatoes and put through food mill or sieve. Scald 1/2 cup corn meal
  in 1 cup of the liquid until it reaches boiling point and thickens.
  Stir constantly so that it will not become lumpy.  Now combine all
  ingredients in large mixing bowl (do not use metal or plastic).
  Cover with cheesecloth and set in a warm place (80-85) until well
  fermented.  In warm humid weather this will take about 24 hours. In
  cool dry weather a few more hours may be required for mixture to
  become active.  Stir every few hours.  When it is ready, pour into a
  large glass jar.  Store in refrigerator at about 38 degrees. If
  necessary stir down a time or two until it stops foaming. It is ready
  for use when about 1/2 inch of clear liquid has risen to the top.
  This will take about 2 days. Stir well before using.
  
  When this starter has been used down to about 1 cupful, add 3 cups
  water, 3 medium sized baked potatoes, 1/2 cup corn meal scalded in 1
  cup of the water, 3 Tbsp. sugar and 2 tsp. salt prepared as for the
  first time (peach leaves are not needed).  Set in warm place until it
  becomes very active in about 6 to 8 hours. Store in refrigerator and
  it will be ready for use the next day.  A properly renewed starter
  improves with age and, once one becomes accustomed to taking care of
  it, it all becomes automatic. When, for some reason, it cannot be
  used about twice a week, stir it thoroughly every few days and add 1
  tsp. sugar. Scald jar and lid before filling each time.

  Bring water to rolling boil and steep peach leaves in it for 15
  minutes. Drain liquid and add enough water to make 3 full cups again.
  This will have a rather unappetizing green color but don't worry! It
  will disappear during the fermentation process.  Peel hot baked
  potatoes and put through a food mill or sieve. Scald 1/2 cup corn
  meal in 1 cup of the liquid until it reaches boiling point and
  thickens. Stir constantly so that it will not become lumpy. Now
  combine all ingredients in large mixing bowl (do not use metal or
  plastic). Cover with cheesecloth and set in warm place (about 80 to
  85F) until well fermented. In warm humid weather this will take about
  24 hours. In cool dry weather a few more hours may be required for
  mixture to become active throughout.  Stir every few hours during the
  process. When it is ready, pour into a large glass jar (I use a 2
  quart glass pickle jar with porcelain lined zinc lid). Store in
  refrigerator at about 38 degrees. If necessary stir down a time or
  two until it stops foaming. It is ready for use when about 1/2 inch
  of clear liquid has risen to the top. This will take about 2 days.
   Stir well each time before using.
  
  When the starter has been used down to about 1 cupful, add 3 cups
  water, 3 medium sized baked potatoes, 1/2 cup corn meal scaled in 1
  cup water, 3 Tbsp. sugar and 2 tsp. salt prepared as for the first
  time (no peach leaves). Set in warm place until it becomes very
  active in about 6 to 8 hours.  Store in refrigerator and it will be
  ready for use the next day.
  
  Peach Leaf Dry Starter:
  
  Follow directions for making Peach Leaf Starter until it is ready to
  store in refrigerator.  Sterilize about 2 quarts of corn meal for 1
  hour in oven, at low temperature so that it will not brown. Stir
  often. After it has cooled stir as much of this into the fermented
  mixture as it will absorb. Spread 1/2 inch thick in flat pans. When
  it has set enough, cut into 1-1/2 inch squares. Separate and lay on
  clean towels or absorbent paper to dry. Do not place in the sun. Be
  careful that insects do not have access to it during the drying
  process. When completely dry and hard, wrap each cake in small
  squares of cellophane and seal with tape. Store in refrigerator in
  moisture proof container. This will keep for a year or more.
  
  Only a portion of the starter mixture may be taken to make a small
  amount of cakes if desired.  Then only a proportionate amount of corn
  meal need be sterilized.
  
  A starter from Dry Yeast:
  
  A starter can be made by combining 1 cake Peach Leaf Dry Yeast, 1/2
  cup warm water, 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1 tsp. sugar in glass bowl. Cover
  with cheesecloth and let stand in warm place (80 to 85 ) until a
  white film covers the top of the water.  This will only take
  overnight in warm, humid weather, a little longer in cool weather.
  Add 1/2 cup water (room temp.), 1/2 cup white flour and 1 tsp. sugar.
  Let stand until foaming actively. Stir often.  Pour into glass fruit
  jar and store in refrigerator with lid loose until foaming has
  stopped. As soon as about 1/2 inch of clear liquid has risen to the
  top the starter has ripened enough to use.

      Title: PEACH LEATHER
 Categories: Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     10 lg Fully ripe peaches
      1 c  Sugar
 
  Peel and slice peaches to measure 10 cups. Put peaches in large
  saucepan. Add sugar and bring mixture to boil, stirring until sugar
  is dissolved. Working in batches, pour mixture into blender or food
  processor and puree. Cool to lukewarm. Meanwhile, prepare smooth,
  level drying surface in full sunlight. Cover baking sheets,
  jelly-roll pans or other flat surfaces with plastic wrap. Pour peach
  puree onto prepared surface, spread to 18-inch thickness and let dry
  in sunlight. Cover with screen to avoid insects. Drying may take 20
  to 24 hours. Bring puree inside at end of day and finish drying
  second day. Or set sheets of fruit in baking pans in oven at 150F and
  leave door open. Fruit is dry when puree can be peeled off plastic
  easily. For storing, roll up leather with plastic wrap. Wrap in more
  plastic wrap and seal tightly. Leather will keep at room temperature
  about 1 month, in refrigerator about 4 months or 1 year in freezer.
  Tear or cut into strips to eat.
  
  Note: Other fresh fruits in season, such as strawberries, plums,
  apricots and pears, may be substituted for the peaches. Compatible
  combinations of fruits also may substituted for a single fruit. Makes

      1 tb Clear Jel(tm)
    3/4 c  Cold water
    1/8 ts Cinnamon (optional)
    1/8 ts Almond extract (opt.)
    1/4 c  Bottled lemon juice

      6 qt Sliced fresh peaches
      7 c  Granulated sugar
      2 c  Clear Jel(tm); plus...
      3 tb Clear Jel(tm)
  5 1/4 c  Cold water
      1 ts Cinnamon (optional)
      1 ts Almond extract (opt.)
  1 3/4 c  Bottled lemon juice
 
  Quality: Select ripe, but firm fresh peaches. Red Haven, Redskin, Sun
  High, and other varieties of similar quality are suitable.
  
  Yield: 1 quart or 7 quarts.
  
  Procedure: Peel peaches. To loosen skins, submerge peaches in boiling
  water for approximately 30-60 seconds, and then place in cold water
  for 20 seconds. Slip off skins and prepare slices 1/2-inch thick.
  Place slices in water containing 1/2 tsp. of ascorbic acid crystals
  or six 500-milligram vitamin C tablets in 1 gallon of water to
  prevent browning. For fresh fruit, place 6 cups at a time in 1 gallon
  boiling water. Boil each batch 1 minute after the water returns to a
  boil. Drain but keep heated fruit in a covered bowl or pot. Combine
  water, sugar, Clear Jel(tm), and, if desired, cinnamon and/or almond
  extract in a large kettle. Stir and cook over medium high heat until
  mixture thickens and begins to bubble. Add lemon juice and boil sauce
  1 minute more, stirring constantly. Fold in drained peach slices and
  continue to heat mixture for 3 minutes. Fill jars without delay,
  leaving 1 inch head-space. Adjust lids and process immediately.

  NOTES : Peaches and cream for the ginger shortcake. Feel free to peel
  the peaches if you like. I find that the skin adds some extra flavor;
  and unless the skins come off with your fingers, I find it a nuisance
  to bring a pot of water to boiling just to submerge the peaches for a
  minute to loosen their skins. Nonfat sour creams vary a lot in
  flavor; be sure to select a good one or this dish will be severely
  compromised. (I use Knudsen.)

 Categories: Bbq sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1 ea Small onion, grated
      2 tb Dark brown sugar
      1 ts Ground cloves
      1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
      1 ea 16 oz can sliced peaches in
           -heavy syrup
    1/2 c  Bailey's Irish Cream
    1/2 c  Chopped bread and butter
           -pickles
 
  Many a good barbeque sauce is based on fruit nowadays. Since in fact,
  botanically speaking, a tomato is a fruit, I suppose one could argue
  that fruit is the most common constituent of any barbeque sauce.
  Still, one based on peaches might seem to be asking a lot of taste
  buds primed to mediate the hot, spicy flavors of a grill. In
  actuality, it provides a soothing contrast to them.
  
  Melt the butter in a small stainless steel or flameproof ceramic
  saucepan set over low heat.  Add the onion, and saute until golden.
  Stir in the brown sugar, cloves, and cayenne pepper, mixing well.
  Drain the peaches, reserving the syrup. Cut the slices in half and
  add them to the saucepan. Lightly blend in first the Bailey's Irish
  Cream then the pickles. Simmer, stirring gently occasionally for 20
  minutes, or until the sauce thickens nicely.  Chill before serving.
  This entire sauce may be blenderized to give it a smooth consistency..

      Title: PEACHES - HALVED OR SLICED
 Categories: Fruits, Canning
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Quantity: An average of 17-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
  quarts; an average of 11 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
  A bushel weighs 48 pounds and yields 16 to 24 quarts--an average of
  2-1/2 pounds per quart.
  
  Quality: Choose ripe, mature fruit of ideal quality for eating fresh
  or cooking.
  
  Procedure: Dip fruit in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds until skins
  loosen. Dip quickly in cold water and slip off skins. Cut in half,
  remove pits and slice if desired. To prevent darkening, keep peeled
  fruit in ascorbic acid solution. Prepare and boil a very light,
  light, or medium syrup or pack peaches in water, apple juice, or
  white grape juice. Raw packs make poor quality peaches.
  
  Hot pack -- In a large saucepan place drained fruit in syrup, water,
  or juice and bring to boil. Fill jars with hot fruit and cooking
  liquid, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Place halves in layers, cut side
  down.

      Title: PEACHES IN APPLE JUICE
 Categories: Fruits, Low-fat
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      3 lb Firm, ripe peaches (about 12
  2 1/2 c  Unsweetened apple juice
 
  Wash and drain peaches.  Cut into halves, pit and peel. Treat to
  prevent darkening.  Cook a few peaches at a time in water until
  heated through. Drain.  Pack hot into hot jars, leaving 1/2 inch head
  space. Heat apple juice and pour over peaches, leaving 1/2 inch head
  space. Remove air bubbles.  Adjust caps.
  
  Process pints 20 minutes, quarts 25 minutes in boiling water bath.
  Yield for original recipe 12 pounds peaches, about 5 quarts. 52
  calories per 1/2 cup serving.
  
  MY NOTE:  The original recipe called for 2 1/2 cups apple juice -
  should be about 2 1/2 quarts (because 3 pounds of peaches required
  about 2 1/2 cups of juice). I cut the peaches in slices and made 7
  half-pint jars. Heated slices of about 4 peaches at a time for 1
  minute in the microwave, and heated the apple juice about 3/4 cup at
  a time in the microwave in a 2 cup measure.

      Title: PEACHY MUSTARD BABY BACK RIBS
 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Honey mustard
      3 tb Peach preserves
      3 tb Peanut oil
      3 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Minced garlic
           Salt and pepper to taste
      2    Racks baby back ribs, about
           -2 pounds, each
 
  Baby back ribs are cut from the back rib section of the pig, and the
  meat on them is as tender as a center-cut pork chop. For that reason,
  they can be grilled fairly quickly without any precooking.
  
  Mix mustard with the peach preserves, peanut oil, lemon juice,
  garlic, salt and pepper.  Marinate the ribs in this mixture for at
  least 30 minutes.
  
  Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are white hot, or preheat a gas
  grill on high for 5 minutes with the lid closed.
  
  Grill the ribs about 4 inches from the hot coals. They will take
  about 6 minutes per side.  Be careful, this sweet sauce burns easily.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: PEACHY PIZZA DESSERT
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Unbleached flour
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/3 c  Butter
      2 tb Yeast
    3/4 c  Warm water
      2 tb Maple syrup
           Filling:
      2 lb Fresh peaches, pitted and
           -sliced
    1/3 c  Fresh lemon juice
    1/4 c  Unbleached flour
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Maple syrup
    1/4 c  Graham cracker crumbs
 
  CRUST:
  
  For the crust, combine flour and baking powder; cut in butter.
  Dissolve yeast in warm water and maple syrup. Let sit for 5 minutes,
  then stir into flour mixture, blending well. Turn onto floured board
  and knead lightly for 5 minutes, adding flour as necessary.  Let
  dough rest for 10 minutes. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out the
  dough to fit either a cookie sheet or round 10-inch pizza pan.
  Transfer dough to oiled pan. If the dough is too sticky to lift from
  board to pan, then, using your hands, pat the dough into the pan you
  will use. Pinch up edges 1-inch all the way around cookie sheet or
  pizza pan to form rim.
  
  Slice peaches and pour lemon juice on top; set aside.
  
  Cut together flour, nutmeg, butter, maple syrup and graham cracker
  crumbs. Spread and sprinkle half of it over the bottom of the pizza
  dough. Arrange the peach slices on the dough, in layers if necessary.
  Sprinkle remaining mixture on top of peaches.  Bake at 350 degrees
  25-30 minutes. Serve warm or cooled.
  
  Even if you have never worked with yeast before, you'll find this
  crust quite easy.
  
  Serves 6.

      Title: PEANUT BUTTER
 Categories: Nuts
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
      1 lb Peanuts, shelled raw
    1/2 ts Salt; to 1 ts
    1/2 ts Sugar; to 1 ts
      2 tb Peanut oil
 
  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Spread the nuts in a jelly roll or
  roasting pan and bake them for 20 minutes, shaking the pan now and
  then; they should be *light* gold. Cool the peanuts, then proceed in
  either of the following ways:
  
  CREAMY:  Put half the nuts in the container of a food processor (or
  jar of a blender) with half of the salt, sugar and oil. Process to a
  creamy consistency (stopping the action and scraping down the sides
  of the container often wih a spatula), then empty the peanut butter
  into a bowl and repeat with the remaining nuts, salt, sugar and oil.
  
  CHUNKY:  Use the processor to chop about one third of the nuts
  coarsely; se aside, then process the remaining nuts, salt, sugar and
  oil to a creamy consistency.  Stir together with the chopped nuts.
  Or use a blender as follows:  Do half of the nuts at a time and
  scrape down he sides of the container and scrape under the blades
  several times. Process to as crunchy a texture as you wish.  It's not
  necessary to chop part of the nuts first for blender chunky peanut
  butter.
  
  TO STORE:  Store refrigerated, in a covered jar, where it will keep
  for about two weeks.

      Title: PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY JEWELS
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      1 c  Bleached all-purpose flour
           (dip and sweep method)
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar (firmly
           -packed)
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
      1 c  Smooth peanut butter
      1 lg Egg
    1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
 
  Makes about 5 dozen 1 3/4-inch cookies
  
  Equipment: Ungreased cookie sheets, 1 1/4-inch cookie scoop, or a
  measuring teaspoon.
  
  Place two oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven.
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
  
  Soften the butter. In a small bowl, sift together he flour, baking
  soda, and salt. Whisk to combine well. Set aside. In a mixing bowl,
  beat the sugars until well mixed. Add the butter and peanut butter
  and beat for several minutes, until very smooth and creamy. Add the
  egg and vanilla extract and beat until incorporated, scraping the
  sides of the bowl. At low speed, gradually beat in the flour mixture
  just until incorporated.
  
  Scrape the dough into a bowl and refrigerate for at least one hour or
  overnight (This keeps the dough from cracking when shaped).
  
  Measure the dough into a 1 1/4-inch cookie scoop or 2 level teaspoons
  and roll it between the palms of your hands to shape 1-inch balls.
  Place the balls 1 1/2 inches apart on the cookie sheets. As soon as
  you roll each ball, use your index finger or the handle of a wooden
  spoon to make a depression going down almost to the cookie sheet in
  the center of each ball.
  
  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned and set. For even
  baking, rotate the cookie sheets from top to bottom and front to back
  halfway through the baking period.
  
  Cool the cookies on the sheets for a few minutes or until firm enough
  to lift. Use a small, angled metal spatula or pancake turner to
  transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely. If necessary,
  while the cookies are still hot, use the greased handle of a wooden
  spoon to deepen the depressions. Fill the centers with cherry
  preserves or milk chocolate topping.
  
  Cherry Preserves Topping: ** 1 1/2 (12-ounce) jars cherry preserves
  
  In a microwave oven or a saucepan, heat the preserves until boiling.
  Strain the jelly into a small heavy saucepan. Place the cherries
  remaining in the strainer in the centers of the cookies. If some are
  crushed, piece them together.
  
  On medium heat, boil the jelly for about 5 minutes, stirring
  constantly until, when it is dropped from the stirring spoon, the
  last drops gather to form one large sticky drop that hangs from the
  spoon. The jelly will be reduced to about 3/4 cup. Allow the jelly to
  cool about 1 minutes or until the bubbling stops. Spoon heaping 1/4
  to 1/2 teaspoons over each cherry.
  
  Milk Chocolate Topping: ** 2 (3-ounce) bars milk chocolate 2
  (3-ounce) bars bittersweet chocolate 6 tablespoons unsalted butter at
  room temperature
  
  Break the chocolate into squares and place them in the top of a double
  boiler. Set it over hot but not simmering water. The water must not
  touch the bottom of the double-boiler insert. Stir until the
  chocolate begins to melt. Return the pan to low heat if the water
  cools, but be careful that the water does not get too hot.
  
  Stir the chocolate until smooth, and cool it until it is no longer
  warm to the touch.( The chocolate may be melted in a microwave oven
  if stirred every 15 seconds. Remove it before it is fully melted and
  stir, using residual heat to complete melting). Whisk in the softened
  butter. The mixture will immediately thicken. Do not overwhisk. Use a
  recloseable quart-size freezer bag with one corner cut off to pipe
  the chocolate into the centers of the cookies or use a small metal
  spatula to spread on a dollop. You can also use a copler with a # 22
  star decorating tube to pipe the chocolate decoratively into the
  centers. Allow the chocolate to set until firm.
  
  Store: In an airtight container Keeps: 1 month
  
  Tip: Using superfine sugar will result in fewer cracks in the cookie's
  surface. It can be prepared easily in a food processor by processing
  granulated sugar for a few minutes or until it is as fine as sand.

    1/2 lb Butter;softened
      2 lb Milk Chocolate Coating
 
  Mix all ingred's until smooth and soft, If sticky add more powdered
  sugar. Make into small logs, egg shape. Melt chocolate coating. I use
  electric fry pan with water on low, and I use a stainless steel bowl
  to melt choc-coating. It gives me more room for dipping eggs. You can
  also just put them in Reese's type molds, and papers. But we shape
  them in Egg shape for Easter. Put on Wax paper lined cookie sheet and
  put in freezer for a few minutes, makes them shiny and nice. PS. I
  use the left over chocolate to make solid chocolate bunny-you can buy
  all kinds of molds that are in expensive.
  
  Or for my Jim add nuts and raisens, and put them in papers. They are
  just like a chunky bar. Or just save it in a jar for next time. the
  kids always like chocolate covered small pretzils. Use your
  imagination. <G> Good Luck and Enjoy By Joni in S.Jersey

  any cereal except once she put in some Froot Loops and I wasn't so
  sure about them but of course it got eaten. One other thing she
  always keeps around to snack on is a bowl of salted peanuts and

  Melissa Mierau's notes:  It really foamed when the dry ingredients
  were added to the wet, sort of like peanut brittle. Then with further
  stirring it thickened up. They baked into a real nice cookie but only
  made about 2 dozen (using teaspoon for scoop instead of ice cream
  scoop). I will double recipe next time!

      Title: PEANUT BUTTER CUP TARTS
 Categories: Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     36    Reese's peanut butter cups
      1 lb Refrigerated cookie dough
 
  * - (Either fudge, sugar, or peanut butter dough)
  
  Refrigerate candies so paper will peel off easily. Unwrap each. Follow
  slicing instructions on cookie wrapper and quarter each slice. Place
  each piece in a greased miniature muffin cup. Place in preheated 350ø
  oven for 8-10 minutes or just until cookie puffs and is barely done.
  Remove from oven and immediately push a candy cup into each cookie
  filled muffin cup. The cookie will deflate and form a tart shell
  around the peanut butter cup. The heat from the cookie will melt the
  chocolate toppings. Let the pan cool; then refrigerate until shine
  leaves the chocolate. Remove from the refrigerator and gently lift
  each tart from the cup with the tip of a knife. Makes 36 cookies.

   Ice box cookies are a boon for the busy person because they can be
  prepared in advance and stored in the freezer until needed. Just
  slice and bake when desired, and you have a great home made cookie.
  
   If you like, use whole wheat flour and add 1/2 cup ground peanuts to
  the dough.
  
   In a large bowl, cream the shortening and peanut butter, blending
  well. Add the honey, mixing it in thoroughly. Gradually blend in
  sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla.
  
   Sift together the flour with baking powder, baking soda and salt.
  Stir the dry ingredients into the creamed mixture. Stir in the
  raisins, if using. Shape in a roll. Wrap in waxed paper and chill
  thoroughly.
  
   Preheat oven to 350ø. Cut chilled dough into thin slices and bake on
  greased cookie sheets at 350ø for 10-12 minutes.

      Title: PEANUT BUTTER ICE CREAM (BON BONS)
 Categories: Chocolate, Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Egg yolks
 14 1/2 oz Can evaporated milk
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/8 ts Salt
 
  Beat eggs well. Blend in the milk, peanut butter, sugar and salt and
  pour into freezer tray.  Freeze until almost hard then pour into a
  bowl and beat until smooth. Return to freezer tray or molds and
  freeze until firm. Makes 4 to 6 servings *Try this with a hot fudge
  sauce and topped with peanuts. Chocolate bon bon Ice cream or other
  favorite flavor hard chocolate topping: Make sure the ice cream is
  hard frozen. Melt 12 oz of semi-sweet chocolate pieces and 1/2 cup
  margarine in the top part of a double boiler. Remove from heat but
  keep warm over hot water. Use a fork to dip ice cream balls into the
  chocolate, working as fast as possible. When you've dipped about 10 -
  12 pieces, place then in the freezer and continue the dipping. After
  the chocolate is firm, you can wrap with foil or plastic wrap. For a
  variation with vanilla ice cream, add 1 Tab instant coffee to the
  melted chocolate. I have in a hurry, bought icecream at the market
  and with a melon spoon dipped the ice cream out into small balls,
  frozen them hard and then dipped in the chocolate as above. A quick
  delicious treat when you want that something extra but don't have the
  time to spend making it or if you have the time, after the first
  dipping and letting the chocolate freeze hard, dip a second time.

  In a medium mixing bowl, combine cold mashed potatoes with salt and

  addition. At first the mixture will be stiff and hard to handle but
  with beating it will become very runny. With the addition of the
  fourth cup, the mixture will firm up again. Turn half of the mixture
  on to a board that's been lightly dusted with icing; roll into a
  rectangle two inches thick. Spread with half of the peanut butter.
  Roll up from the short side, jelly-roll fashion. Repeat with rest of

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings

  Remove from heat and stir in cereal so that all pieces are as coated
  as desired (If you want it sweeter use less cereal if you want to
  stretch it out use more.)

  Slice the onion thinly.  Slice the carrot into matchsticks. Chop the
  beans finely.  Heat 2 teaspoons oil in the wok and stir-fry these
  ingredients 2-3 minutes.
  
  Chop the cabbage leaves and add them to the wok along with the
  beansprouts. Continue stir-frying until just tender.
  
  Crush the garlic.  Grate the ginger finely.  Heat the remaining
  teaspoon oil in a small saucepan and add the garlic and ginger. Cook
  for a minute or two, then stir in the peanut butter and then the
  water. Stir until smooth. (This much can be done before the
  vegetables start cooking; the rest should wait until they are nearly
  ready.) Add the lemon juice, soy sauce and milk, and stir well.

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Shelled peanuts
      2 c  Granulated sugar
 
  Chop the peanuts fine.  Put the sugar into a skillet and stir
  constantly until it is all melted.  Then add the peanuts and pour at
  once into a buttered pan. When cold, break into pieces.
  
  The finely chopped peanuts make, of course, a much more uniformly
  nutty candy than the usual peanut brittle. The recipe makes about one
  pound of candy.
