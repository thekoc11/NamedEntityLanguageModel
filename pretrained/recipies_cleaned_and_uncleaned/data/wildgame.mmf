      Title: Venison Roast
 Categories: game
      Yield: 4 servings

      3 lb chunk of venison roast (or
      1    roll it if its in steak
      1    form)
      2 c  onion - cut up (2 in.
      1    pieces)
      2 c  potato - cut up
      1 c  carrots - cut up
      1 c  fresh mushrooms - sliced
      2 tb liquid smoke
      3 tb (or more) worchestershire
      1    sauce
      3 tb (or more) soy sauce
    1/2 c  beef broth

Contributed to the echo by: Bob Lester Assorted Meat herbs (whatever you
like) Put a LARGE oven cooking bag in an oblong baking pan (so that the bag
fits inside the pan). To the bag, add the venison. Add all liquids, then
veggies around the meat. Put the 'shrooms on top of everything else, then
the spices on top of them. You want to have about 1 inch of liquid in the
bottom of the bag, so if you need more, add a little water (or white
wine!).

Seal bag. Poke several small holes in top of bag to let steam escape. Bake
at 300-325 for 3-1/2 hours. (If you chop the veggies big, they won't
overcook).

separate meat from the bones and cut into small pieces. Butter a casserole
and put a layer of the potato filling in the bottom, then a layer of meat;
add 1 Tbsp of sauce (made by combining the flour and water), seasoning, and
continue until dish is filled. Bake at 350-F until brown (about 25
minutes). Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine Old Recipes, Culinary

      Yield: 1 servings

      3 lb venison cubed/course ground
      3 cn kidney beans as extender
      3 cn tomato sauce
      2 cn tomato paste
      1 lg onion
    1/4 lb butter
      1 lb fresh mushrooms

      1    other spices that look good
      1    that you have a mind to use.

Brown the venison (or other wild game) with some butter.  Venison tends to
be somewhat dry, so add butter as needed.  Drain well.  Add to 6-8 quart
slow cooker.  (A large pot on the stove will work, but overnight cooking
is preferred).  Add other ingredients, mixing well.  Add only enough water
to prevent burning.  Cook covered for 2 hours at boil.  Reduce heat to
~200 degrees and cook until you can't keep everyone away.  Consistancy
should be fairly thick.  Cook uncovered if too thin.

Top with shredded cheese of choice and serve with fresh cornbread.

Freezes well if any left over.

      Title: Grilled Buffalo Steak
 Categories: meats, game
      Yield: 4 servings

      1    marinade:
    1/2 c  fruity olive oil
      3    cloves garlic, minced
    3/4 c  dry red wine
      1 ts black pepper
      1    steaks 6-8 oz each
      4    strip buffalo steaks

Place steaks in glass dish or plastic zip lock bag and pour marinade over.
Marinate at least 6 hours or overnight.  Drain.  Grill over medium hot
coals for 2-3 min, then flip and cook second side 1-2 min.

The amount of time depends on thickness of steaks and intensity of heat but
Wills (Steven Wills of the Western Canadian Bison Ranch with a herd of 50
animals) says you must take great care not to overcook the meat.  Grill at
a slightly lower temperature than beef and don't pierce with a fork! Remove
from grill and let steak stand 5 min. before serving.  Serve with grilled
vegetables.

      Title: Jellied Moose Nose
 Categories: meats, game, canadian
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    upper jawbone of a moose
      1    onion; sliced
      1    garlic clove
      1 tb mixed pickling spice
      1 ts salt
    1/2 ts pepper
    1/4 c  vinegar

1.  Cut the upper jaw bone of the moose just below the eyes.

2.  Place in a large kettle of scalding water and boil for 45 minutes.

3.  Remove and chill in cold water.

4.  Pull out all the hairs - these will have been loosened by the boiling
and should come out easily ( like plucking a duck).

5.  Wash thoroughly until no hairs remain.

6.  Place the nose in a kettle and cover with fresh water.

7.  Add onion, garlic, spices and vinegar

8.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the meat is tender.
Let cool overnight in the liquid.

9.  When cool, take the meat out of the broth, and remove and discard the
bones and the cartilage.  You will have two kinds of meat, white meat
from the bulb of the nose, and thin strips of dark meat from along the
bones and jowls.

10. Slice the meat thinly and alternate layers of white and dark meat in a
loaf pan.

11. Reheat the broth to boiling, then pour the broth over the meat in the
loaf pan.

12. Let cool until jelly has set.  Slice and serve cold.

I must confess I have not yet tried this recipe, mainly for lack of a moose
nose...   But, sometime, maybe...

      Title: Kangaroo Escalopes With Spinach And Anchovy Butter
 Categories: game, australian
      Yield: 6 servings

    600 g  kangaroo fillet, trimmed
      2 bn of english spinach
     12    anchovy fillets
    200 g  unsalted butter
      1 ts lemon juice
      1 ts black pepper freshly ground
      1 ts sea salt
      1    olive oil

"Most people won't have ever tasted kangaroo. It is a sweet, strong-tasting
meat, it's texture and taste described as somwe- here between venison and
liver...To eat kangaroo, you have to like game; you have to like offal and
you have to be a red meat eater...It's a very big, very strong-tasting
meat."

These recipes are by Chris Manfield from The Paragon Cafe, Circular Quay.

Slice the kangaroo fillet into thin slices, three per serve. Brush with
olive oil and sprinkle lightly with black pepper. Remove stalks from
spinach and wash leaves thoroughly. Plunge into rapidly boiling water for
30 seconds. Strain and immerse immediately in iced water to stop the
cooking process and main- tain the green colour. When cold, remove leaves
from water and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Refrigerate until
ready to use.

Soften 100 g unsalted butter and blend in food processor with the
anchovies, lemon juice and a pinch of sea salt and pepper until smooth.
Scrape out onto a piece of foil and form into a sausage shape. Refrigerate
until firm Heat a large, heavy- base, cast-iron fry pan or grill plate
until hot. Toss in the oiled meat slices and quickly sear on each side. Do
not turn until the first side is properly sealed--this does not take very
long--and don't overcook. Remove meat and rest in a warm place until all
the meat slices are cooked. In another pan, over medium heat, melt the
remaining butter, add the squeezed spinach and the salt and pepper, and
stir until the spinach is hot. Divide the spinach into four portions, spoon
onto the centre of the plate, top with three escalopes. Slice the anchovy
butter so it begins to melt over the hot meat. Serve immediately.

      Title: Scottish Rabbit Curry
 Categories: game, scottish, curries
      Yield: 6 servings

      1    fresh rabbit
      6 oz streaky bacon
      6    button onions
      4 tb butter
      1 tb flour
      1 tb curry-powder
      1 ts mushroom-powder
      1    celery (optional)
      1    coco-nut (optional)
      1    salt and cayenne to taste
      1 pt well seasoned stock

Choose a fat, fresh rabbit.  (To test it, examine the kidney.)  Cut it into
at least twelve pieces; brown these in butter, with onions.  When browned,
if you wish delicate cookery, pour off the butter and add three-quarters of
a pint of well-seasoned stock, one large spoonful of curry-powder and one
of flour, six ounces of streaky bacon cut into half inch cubes, and also
half a dozen button onions.  Season with a teaspoonful of mushroom powder.
Simmer this slowly for half an hour at least, stirring it.  Add what more
seasonings you think required, as cayenne, a little turmeric, or some acid.
Pile up the pieces of rabbit and pour the sauce, which should be thickish
as in all curry dishes, over them.  Serve with plain boiled rice in a
separate dish.

Fresh coco-nut is an excellent ingredient in mild curries.  Rasp and stew
it the whole time; we do not like green vegetables in curries though they
are sometimes used.  Mushrooms are an enrichment, celery is good, and onion
is indispensable.

      Title: Venison Sauces
 Categories: game, sauces, scottish
      Yield: 6 servings

    1/4 lb sugar
    1/2 pt champagne vinegar
      1    sweet sauce:
      6 oz white or red currant jelly
      6 oz white or red wine

Sharp Sauce:

Sharp Sauce:--A quarter-pound of the best loaf-sugar, or white candy-sugar,
dissolved in a half-pint of Champagne vinegar, and carefully skimmed.

Sweet Sauce:--Melt some white or red currant jelly with a glass of white or
red wine, whichever suits best in color; or serve jelly unmelted in a small
sweetmeat-glass.  This sauce answers well for hare, fawn, or kid, and for
roast mutton to many tastes.

Gravy for Venison:--Make a pint of gravy of trimmings of venison or shanks
of mutton thus:  broil the meat on a quick fire till it is browned, then
stew it slowly.  Skim, strain, and serve the gravy it yields, adding salt
and a teaspoonful of walnut pickle.

      Title: Rabbit, Veal Or Chicken Stew With Herbs & Barley
 Categories: poultry, game, veal
      Yield: 6 servings

      2 oz butter
  2 1/2 lb rabbit, stewing veal or 
           -chicken joi; nts
      1 lb leeks, thickly sliced
      4    cloves garlic, chopped

      6 oz pot barley
  3 3/4 c  water
      3 tb wine vinegar
      2    bay leaves salt pepper
      1 tb dried sage

In 7th century England, herbs were one of the few flavourings available to
cooks and were used heavily...

Melt the butter in a heavy pan and fry the meat with the leeks and garlic
till the vegetables are slightly softened and the meat lightly browned. Add
the barley, water, vinegar, bay leaves and seasoning. bring the pot to the
boil, cover it and simmer gently for 1 - 1 1/2 hours or till the meat is
really tender and ready to fall from the bone. Add the sage and continue to
cook for several minutes. Adjust the seasoning to taste and serve in
bowls-- the barley will serve as a vegetable.

      Title: Small Bird And Bacon Stew With Walnuts Or Hazelnuts
 Categories: game
      Yield: 6 servings

      6    fatty rashers of bacon, 
           -chopped rou; ghly
      3    cloves garlic
      4    pigeons or other small game 
           -birds (; 6 if very small)
      8 oz mushrooms, chopped roughly
      3 oz hazelnuts or walnuts, 
           -roasted, coar; sely chopped
  1 1/4 c  real ale
    3/4 c  water
      3    bay leaves salt black 
           -pepper, fresh; ground
      6    coarse slices brown bread

Fry the bacon, with the garlic, till it is lightly browned in a heavy
bottomed casserole. Add birds and brown on all sides. Add the mushrooms and
nuts, continue to cook for a couple of minutes, then add the ale and water
with the bay leaves.

Bring to the boil, cover and simmer very gently for 2 - 2 1/2 hours-- the
birds should be falling off the bone. Remove the birds from the juices,
cool juices completely and remove any excess fat. The birds can be served
whole on or off the bone. If the latter, carve them while they are cold
then return to the skimmed juices and reheat gently. Adjust the seasoning
to taste and serve either the whole birds of the slices on the pieces of
bread, with plenty of the juices and "bits". A good green salad to follow
is the best accompaniment.

If you kill a big buck and know he will not be as tender as my spikehorns,
cut a round steak about 2 inches thick, dredge in flour, let stand for an
hour and then reflour the wet spots. Sear on both sides in a hot,
lightly-greased skillet or black iron pot. Now pour the can of soup
directly onto the center of the steak, then add enough hot water to cover

undiluted soup, tomato paste, and a good dash of Worcestershire and sherry.
Heat to simmering and keep hot in a small pan. MAKE TWO SEPARATE OMELETS,
using 2 Tbsp butter for each and letting the pan get sizzling before
pouring in eggs. Cook over high heat, shaking and lifting the pan so it
will cook evenly. Make the first a little soft and firm up in oven. Fold,
add butter, and pass sauce. Hugg's Note
: Use oysters, not shrimp, but vary the soup. Suggestions: Try cream of
Asparagus or other semi-herbal soup. Recipe date: 09/21/70

      Title: Shanghai Duck
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 8 servings

      8 lg scallions,
      1    cut into 2-inch lengths
      2 md star anise, broken into
      1    16 sections
      2 sl gingerroot,
      1    half-dollar size
      5 lb duck
      1 c  dark soy sauce
      1 c  light soy sauce
      1 c  water
    3/4 c  sugar.
      1    honey

Put the scallions, star anise and gingerroot in a heavy pot. Place the
duck, breast sideup in the pot. Mix the remaining ingredients and pour over
the duck. Cover and bring to a boil. Simmer for about two hours or until
tender, turning every half-hour. Remove duck from pan and place on a
shallow dish, rub honey on duck, place duck in a 400 degree oven just until
crispy...not too long.  Remove and chop into small pieces. Reserve liquid
and serve at the table as a sauce. Sometimes I thicken it a little but most
of the time we just serve it as is.

My family loves canned lychees but they are expensive to serve to such a
large family, so I streeetch them by putting them in strawberry jello. I
make the jello and let it almost set, then add the drained lychees (I used
the juice from the lychees for my liquid), so that the lychees "float"
through the jello.  This is so simple but my family demands it at almost
every big dinner. Often they will spoon the jello and lychees into a glass
and add cream to it. It makes the lychees go farther and molded it is a
pretty and colorful dish on the table. ---

      Title: Venison Pizza
 Categories: game
      Yield: 7 servings

      1 lb ground venison
      6 c  unbleached flour
  1 1/2 c  buttermilk
      4 tb butter or margarine
      4 tb honey
    1/2 ts salt
      1    package of yeast
    1/4 c  warm water
      3 c  grated cheese
      1 sm onion, chopped
      2 cn pizza sauce
      1    chives (optional)
      1    oregano
      1    garlic powder
      1    pepper
      1    thyme

First, measure flour into large bowl.  In a separate container combine
buttermilk, butter, honey and salt.  Heat the buttermilk mixture to
lukewarm.  Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add yeast and milk mixture to
flour and combine to make a firm dough.  Turn dough out and kneed for about
6 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.  Put the dough in a greased
bowl, cover and let rise until double in bulk, about 1 hour. While dough is
rising, prepare the toppings.  Grate plenty of cheese.

Chop some onions and some wild chive if you have some handy.  Fry venison,
crumbling it as you fry.  When dough has risen, punch it down, divide it in
half, and roll out the two parts to fit your baking sheets. The dough
should be about 1/4-inch thick.  Let the rolled out dough rise for about 15
minutes.  Spread a generous amount of pizza sauce on the dough. Sprinkle on
plenty of oregano, garlic powder, pepper and a little thyme. Top with
grated cheese and the crumbled venison. Bake at 350F for 20 to 30 minutes.

      Title: Savory Venison Chili
 Categories: game, chili
      Yield: 6 servings

    1/4 lb slab bacon, cut into 1/4 
           -dice
      1 md onion, coarsely chopped
      6 md carrots, peeled, halved 
           -lengthwise; and cut into 1 
      2 ts chili powder
      2 ts ground cumin
      1 ts dried marjoram or oregano
    1/4 ts red pepper flakes
      2 lb venison shoulder, cut into 
           -1/2 cube; s
      1 cn italian plum tomatoes, 
           -crushed (28; oz)
  1 1/2 c  defatted chicken broth (or 
           -beef bro; th)
    1/2 c  red wine
    1/4 c  tomato paste
      1 cn dark-red kidney beans, 
           -drained (16; oz)
      1 c  baby lima beans
      3 c  cooked rice or barley (opt)

I like to start off this chili with bacon. Once it browns, use 2
tablespoons of the bacon fat to wilt the vegetables - then one more
tablespoon of the fat should be enough to brown the venison. Since the meat
is lean, brown it quickly over high heat.

1. Brown the bacon in a skillet over medium heat for about 10 minutes or
until golden brown. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Reserve 3 tablespoons of bacon fat; discard the rest.

2. Place 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat in a casserole; add the onion and
carrots, sprinkle with chili powder, cumin, marjoram and red pepper flakes,
then cook for 5 minutes. Add the reserved bacon.

3. Pour the remaining tablespoon of bacon fat back into the skillet. Brown
the venison over medium-high heat in small batches and remove to the
casserole with a slotted spoon. (The meat should brown quickly, so raise
the heat to high if necessary.)

4. Add the tomatoes, broth, wine and tomato paste. Bring to a simmer and
cook, uncovered, for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat if
the chili begins to boil.

5. Add the kidney beans and lima beans, then adjust the seasonings. Simmer
10 minutes longer or until meat is tender.

6. Serve the chili hot in 6 bowls (over rice or barley, if desired).

Per serving (without rice): 514 calories, 12 grams fat, 135 milligrams
cholesterol.

      Title: Beef Jerky #1
 Categories: game, beef
      Yield: 20 servings

      3 lb rump roast (or similar cut)
    1/2 c  light japanese soy sauce i 
           -use kikk; omon
    1/4 c  worchestershire sauce
    1/4 c  white vinegar
      1 c  water
    1/2 ts ground ginger
    1/4 ts ground red pepper
    1/4 ts ground black pepper
      1 tb onion powder
      1    clove garlic, smashed

have the butcher cut your roast in 1/8 inch slice against the grain. OR do
it at home.  if you don't have good cutlery, have the butcher do it. it
won't be worth it!

cut off the slice of fat on the bottom.  separate the two distinct sinews.
(you can tell, the grain goes one way on one, and the other way on the
other).  Trim out the "gristle" that is between them. slice the two sinews
against the grain into 1/8 inch slices.

Mix the soya, and remaining ingredients to make the marinade. Marinade the
meat slices for 6 or 8 hours in the fridge. (I usually place in a ziploc
type bag, and place in a bowl--turning a couple of times to be sure all the
slices get an equal chance at the marinade)

Note: I use the smoke very spareingly,  I've used as much as a 1/4 teas.
(10 drops) in this recipe.  Any more is too much IMHO. But you might use
more if you really like smoke, but a little goes a long way. I prefer
Japanese soya, cuz it's lighter than the Chinese soya. And I get the Light
Japanese soya, which has significantly less salt. You could add more red
pepper if you like it spicey or use fresh ginger instead of bottled. If you
like it sweeter, replace the water with a cup of Vermont maple syrup. Also
when choosing your roast, the leaner, the better.

    1/3 c  worcestershire sauce
    1/3 c  soy sauce
    1/3 c  barbecue sauce
    1/3 c  liquid smoke

Cut meat in thin slices. Meat is easier to cut when partially frozen and it
will cut evenly. Combine salt, peppers, meat tenderizers, seasoned salt,
accent, garlic and onion powders, kitchen bouquet, morton tender quick,
worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, barbecue sauce and liquid smoke. Marinate
meat in sauce for 24 hours in a sealable plastic bag. Place meat directly
on oven racks, line bottom of oven with foil, or on rack in shallow pan and
dry in oven for 6-8 hours on lowest setting. Continue to dry in warm oven
if necessary. Oven's with pilot lights work especially well.

 Categories: game
      Yield: 1 servings

      1 lg gila monster
    1/2 c  butter
    1/2 c  truffles
    1/2 lb brie
      1 qt chablis

Do NOT skin him/her, or s/he will become angry

Place Gila Monster into a very heavy iron pot.  Very quickly add the
butter, truffles, Brie, and Chablis.  Place a close-fitting lid on the pot.
cook over mesquite charcoal for one hour.  Carefully lift the lid. The Gila
Monster may look done, but don't believe him.  He has drunk the Chablis and
is sublimely happy as the heated pot ALMOST equals the heat of his natural
habitat:  The Arizona Desert.

On second thought, set the Gila Monster free and treat yourself to the Brie
and Chablis!

Best made in large quantities.  Recipe therefor serves 12.

more lard as required.  Remove the meat and reserve.  Fry onions until
browned.  Remove onions from pot and reserve.  Add remaining lard. Add
paprika and stir well.  Slowly add red wine and water, continuing to stir
to make sure there are no lumps of paprika.  Add meat and onions to pot

approximate, use more, or less, as you wish.  Cook gently, covered, for 3
hours.  Check occasionally, and add more water as required.  Remove coarse
spices, and add celery and parsley.  Serve with a bowl of sour cream, so
each person can help themselves.

ought to be included.

      Title: Stuffed Venison Pinwhells
 Categories: meats, game
      Yield: 8 servings

      2    whole venison backstraps,
      1    rolled out 1/4 in. thick
      1 qt whole milk
      2 ts wild game seasoning
      1 lb velveeta cheese
      1 cn rotel tomatoes with diced
      1    chiles
      2 lb thinly sliced lean bacon
    1/2 c  thinly sliced green onions
      8    cloves garlic, finely mince

First, prepare the backstrap fillet. It's an extremely tender tubelike
piece of meat about 12 inches long and 2 to 3 inches in diameter. And
because of its shape, it can be cut around the perimeter, 1/4 inch thick,
and rolled out flat. To do this, you need a very sharp knife. Start by
laying out the fillet perpendicular to your body and making a shallow slice
about 1/4 inch deep in the meat. Then, as if slicing through and unrolling
paper towels from a roll, begin working around the outside perimeter of the
fillet until the backstrap comes out looking like a round steak. It takes a
little practice to do ... but you can do it! When the meat is ready, place
both pieces into a glass or plastic container and cover them with whole
milk. You want to marinate the venison for at least 6 hours, but preferably
overnight. The milk tenderizes the deer and helps to remove any unwanted
gamey flavor. After the marination process, remove the meat from the milk
(you can discard the milk), and pat the venison dry with several paper
towels. Then liberally sprinkle both sides with wild game seasoning and rub
it briskly into the meat. At this point, preheat your oven to 400 degrees.
Then, in your food processor, mix together the Velveeta cheese and the
Rotel tomatoes until smooth and creamy. When you're ready to make the
pinwheels, spread a thin layer of the cheese mixture evenly over one side
of the deer. Then place a layer of bacon strips - side by side - on top of
the cheese. Finish up the preparation by lightly sprinkling on a little
sliced green onions and a little minced garlic. Now tightly roll up the
flattened fillets and set them aside momentarily. Then on the same work
surface, lay out another 8 to 10 strips of bacon side by side and put one
of the rolled backstraps on top of them. Now wrap the bacon strips around
the venison and pin them in place with toothpicks. When you are finished,
the backstrap should be completely encased in bacon strips. Repeat with the
other backstrap. All that's left is to take a sharp knife, slice the rolled
venison into 2 inch thick pinwheels, position them on a shallow cookie
sheet, and bake them - uncovered - in the oven for about 40 to 45 minutes.
You'll notice that a light sauce will form in the bottom of the cookie
sheet; you can use this to baste the pinwheels as they cook. The one thing
you don't want to do is overcook the venison - it will come out dry and
chewy instead of juicy and tender if you do! Chef's Note: If you don't have
wild game seasoning on hand, you can lightly sprinkle the venison with
salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and sweet basil as a
substitute. Unfortunately, most spice manufacturers don't make a premixed
wild game seasoning, but my company does. If you'd like me to send you
some, simply call 1-800-742-4231

      1 lb ground venison
      3 oz pork fat back, ground
      1    salt
      1    freshly ground pepper

Because venison has so little fat, you'll need to add some for a juicy
burger. But don't use deer fat - it tastes bad.)

Mix venison, pork, salt and pepper, handling as little as possible. Heat
grill. Brush burgers with vegetable oil and grill about 4 minutes; turn and
cook to desired doneness. Serve on rolls with your choice of condiments.

      Title: Curried Goat (Smoked)
 Categories: main dish, game
      Yield: 14 servings

      1    goat; around 25 pounds, 
           -quarter

--------------------------------CURRY PASTE---------------------------------
      4 md onions; chunked
    3/4 c  curry powder
      1    whole *bulb* garlic; peeled
      1 tb salt
      1    to 2 fresh habaneros   -or-
      1    scotch bonnet chiles; minced
           - or-
      4    to 5 fresh jalapenos; minced
      1 c  oil; pref. canola or corn

----------------------------CURRY MOP  (OPTIONAL----------------------------
      2 c  chicken or beef stock or 
           -beer
      2 c  cider vinegar
  1 1/2 c  oil (corn or canola)
      1 c  water
      2 tb curry powder
      1    your favorite barbecue sauce

NOTE: Be CAREFUL when handling Habaneros or Scotch Bonnets!

The night before you plan to barbecue, prepare the paste in a food
processor. First process the onions, curry, garlic, salt and habaneros
until finely chopped. Then add the oil, processing until the mixture forms
a thick paste. This can be done in two batches if needed.

Wearing rubber gloves, rub the paste over the goat, covering the meat
evenly. Place the goat in a plastic bag and refrigerate overnight.

Before you begin to barbecue, remove the goat from the refrigerator and
let it sit, covered, at room temperature for 45 minutes.

Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200 to
220 degrees F.

If you plan to baste the meat...mix together the mop ingredients in a
saucepan and warm the liquid over low heat.

Transfer the goat to the smoker. Cook for about 1-1/4 hours per pound of
weight for each quarter. The forequarters will be done earlier than the
hindquarters, which may take 10 hours or longer, depending on size. In a
wood-burning pit, turn the meat and drizzle the mop over it every 30
minutes. In other styles of smokers, baste as appropriate and turn the meat
at the same time.

When the meat is done, remove it from the smoker, and allow it to sit
for 15 minutes before serving. Slice or shred the meat and serve with...
[your favorite barbecue sauce].

      Title: Bordelaise Sauce For Game
 Categories: game, sauces, beef
      Yield: 6 servings

----------------------------------MATIGNON----------------------------------
    1/3 c  parsnip, diced
    1/3 c  celery ribs&leaves, chopped
      1    sprig of thyme
      1 ts bacon fat or butter
    1/3 c  onion, chopped
      2    bay leaves, crushed
      1 tb bacon, minced
    1/4 c  madeira

------------------------------SAUCE ESPAGNOLE-------------------------------
      1 c  matignon, from above
    1/2 c  flour
      2 c  tomatoes, peeled, chopped
      8 c  stock, clarified carb/beef
    1/2 c  caribou or beef drippings
     12    cracked peppercorns
    1/4 c  parsley, chopped

------------------------------BORDELAISE SAUCE------------------------------
    1/2 c  dry red wine
      1 c  espagnole sauce, from above
      6    crushed peppercorns
    1/4 c  bone marrow, diced.

This is a three step process ( four if you count making the stock in
advance) but well worth it as it makes a superb accompliment to the finest
game or beef steaks and roasts. The Matignon is similar to Mirepoix. Carrot
is traditional in the classic French recipe but parsnip is more appropriate
for game. Melt the bacon fat, mince the vegetables and add to the pan with
the herbs. Cook slowly for 15 minutes until vegetables are soft. Set aside
and deglaze pan with the madeira. Reserve the liquid. Melt in a heavy
saucepan the drippings. Add the Matignon and reheat it. Add the flour, heat
and stir until browned. Then add the pepper, tomatoes, parsley and stir.
Add the stock and simmer gently until liquid reduced by half, about 2-2 1/2
hrs. Stir occasionally and skim fat off the top as it accumulates. Strain
the sauce and stir occasionally as it cools to avoid skimming. There should
be about 6 cups. Set aside 5 cups for other brown sauces later and take one
cup for the last step. In a saucepan, gently simmer red wine with pepper
until reduced to 3/4. Add one cup of Espagnole and simmer 5 min. Add
reserved madeira de-glazing liquid from step one and the diced marrow and
poach it 5 min. Serve with game or beef chops, steaks, roasted Fillet
Mignon, char boiled cuts and sweetbreads.

      Title: Caribou Mincemeat Pie
 Categories: pies, game
      Yield: 8 servings

      2 c  apple cider
      1 c  raisins
    1/2 c  dried currants
  1 1/2 c  apples; peeled and chopped
    1/4 lb ground caribou meat
      1 ts ground cinnamon
      1 ts ground cloves
      1 ts ground ginger
    1/2 ts ground nutmeg
    1/4 ts ground allspice
    1/4 c  brandy or dark rum
      1    pastry recipe

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, combine cider, raisins, and currants. Cover
and heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer 30
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add apples, caribou, cinnamon, cloves,
ginger, salt, nutmeg, and allspice. Simmer 2 hours longer. Add water as
necessary to keep mincemeat from sticking to saucepan. Cool mincemeat to
room temperature, add the liquor and let sit at least overnight before
making pies.

Mincemeat can be kept in a cool place in a stone crock for 2 weeks, canned
or frozen. If frozen, thaw mincemeat before making pie.

Prepare pastry and refrigerate until ready to use-at least 30 minutes. Heat
oven to 350'F. Divide pastry; roll out bottom crust and roll out and cut
strips for a top lattice. Carefully spoon mincemeat into crust-lined pie
plate. Place pastry strips one at a time across mincemeat to create a woven
grid. Lift edge of bottom crust over ends of strips. Pinch together and
flute edge. Bake pie 50 to 55 minutes or until crust is lightly browned and
filling bubbles. Cool 10 minutes on wire rack before cutting.

Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.

      Title: Pheasant With Champagne Cabbage Vi (Assembly
 Categories: game
      Yield: 4 servings

      1    pheasants **
      1    pheasant stock **
      1    mousseline stuffing **
      1    pheasant sauce **
      1    champagne cabbage **
      6 tb butter, clarified **

** See recipes for Clarified Butter, Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage I
(Stock), Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage II (Stuffing), Pheasant with
Champagne Cabbage III (Sauce), Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage IV
(Pheasant), and Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage V (Cabbage).

To Assemble: ============

Place the leg-thigh portions of the Pheasants, skin side down and
short ends toward yourself between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; flatten gently
with a mallet or side of a cleaver.

Spread about 1/3 cup of stuffing on each portion and fold meat over to
form a 1/2-inch border on each of the 2 long sides.

Starting with a short side, roll the stuffing and meat into a neat
cylinder.  Use kitchen twine to tie compactly, wrapping twine around once
lengthwise and 3 times crosswise. Chill, covered, until firm (at least 30
minutes.)

Preheat oven to 450 F.

Heat 6 tablespoons of clarified butter in a large oven-proof skillet.

Salt and pepper the stuffed leg packages and saute, shaking pan
occasionally, until golden on all sides (about 4 minutes.) Place skillet in
oven and roast for 4 minutes.

Return skillet to the top of stove over medium-high heat. Add breast
halves to the pan, skin side up, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Saute
for 2 minutes, shaking pan occasionally.

Turn breasts skin side down, sprinkle with salt and pepper and return
to the oven until everything is tender (about 7 minutes.)

Transfer meat to work surface.  Cut leg-thigh portions crosswise into
1/2-inch-thick slices.  Thinly slice breasts lengthwise on a diagonal.

To Serve: =========

Mound about 1/2 cup of cabbage in the center of each of 4 warmed
serving plates.  Place leg-thigh slices around bottom of each plate,
overlapping slightly. Place breast slices in a fan pattern at top of each
plate, overlapping slightly.  Spoon some sauce around the meat and cabbage;
serve the rest of the sauce separately.

      Title: Pheasant Amerind
 Categories: game
      Yield: 2 servings

      2 lb pheasant hen, cleaned (up to
           - 2 1/2; lb)
      1    onion, quartered
      1    bay leaf
      6    peppercorns
      1 sm carrot, sliced
      1    celery stalk, sliced
      1 ts salt
      4 tb butter
      1 pn thyme, powdered
    1/4 ts rosemary, dried and crumbled
    1/4 c  mushrooms, chopped
      2 tb flour
      2 tb black walnut meats, finely 
           -chopped

COOK BIRDS:  Split pheasant down the breastbone (or have your butcher do
this).  Rinse the halves, place in a deep pot and barely cover with water.
Add bay leaf, onion, carrot, celery, salt and peppercorns.

Bring to rolling boil, then turn down heat and simmer for approximately 30
minutes, or until tender.  Remove foam and scum as it forms. Remove bird(s)
from broth, reserving the broth.

Using a heavy skillet, saute the halves in about 2 T of the butter until
golden.  Place birds into small roasting pan or casserole with just enough
water to cover the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with thyme and rosemary.
Bake, lightly covered with foil, for 30-40 minutes at 350 degrees F.

MAKE GRAVY:  While the birds are in the oven, strain the broth and boil
rapidly down to about 2 cups.

Brown the mushrooms using the same skillet in which you browned the
pheasant. Remove the mushrooms and keep them warm.

Melt the remaining 2 T  of butter in the skillet.  Add the flour, stirring
up the browning from the pan. Cook over moderately high heat until golden
brown. Blend in the broth using a wire whisk.

Add mushrooms and continue cooking approximately 1-2 minutes. Turn down
heat, cover and keep warm until pheasant is roasted.

When the pheasants are cooked, remove them from the oven and scrape the
herbs from the skin. After placing the pheasant halves on a warm platter
(or leaving them in the casserole), pour the gravy over the pheasant.
Garnish with the chopped nutmeats and serve. This dish is particularly good
with wild rice.

NOTES:

*  Pheasant in the North American tradition -- This recipe is adapted from
the exceptionally good, controlled-circulation Recipes Only Magazine. The
original dish was created by Mary Richard for use in her Teepee Restaurant,
in Winnipeg. I found some of the ingredients hard to locate in a hurry and
used what I had available with good results. You can substitute rock
Cornish hen, guinea fowl, or chicken for the pheasant and hazelnuts,
filberts or walnuts for the black walnuts.

: Difficulty:  easy once you have the all the ingredients ready.
: Time:  40 minutes preparation, 80 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  measure the spices.

      Title: Oven-Braised Pheasant With Sauerkraut
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 6 servings

    1/2 ts dried thyme or i sprig fresh
      2 sl lean bacon, diced
      2    pheasants, 2 lb each *
      3 lb sauerkraut, thoroughly 
           -rinsed and d; rained
  1 1/2 c  dry white wine
      1 ts juniper berries (about 20)
      2    cloves
      1    bay leaf

* skinned, trimmed of fat and cut into serving pieces (backbones included)
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. In a large Dutch oven, saute bacon over
medium heat until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Add legs, backs and wings and
brown in batches on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. (Refrigerate breast pieces,
covered, until needed.) Add sauerkraut, wine, Juniper berries, thyme,
cloves and bay leaf to the Dutch oven. Cook over medium heat until about
half the liquid has evaporated, about 10 to 15 minutes. Place the Dutch
oven in the oven, uncovered. Bake for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally
and adding liquid as needed, until the legs are tender and the sauerkraut
is slightly browned. Remove the Dutch oven from the oven, discard backs,
wings and bay leaf, season to taste, cover and keep warm. Raise the oven
temperature to 425 degrees F. Salt and pepper pheasant breasts and place
them on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast them for 20 to 25 minutes, or until
juices run clear when they are pierced with a fork. Remove the breasts from
the roasting pan, set aside and keep warm. Reheat the legs in the Dutch
oven briefly. Slice the meat from the breasts and lay it over the legs and
sauerkraut.

      Title: Pheasant With Black Olives
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 8 servings

      4    pheasants

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      2 c  zinfandel
      3 lg shallots, peeled, thinly 
           -sliced
      5    garlic cloves, peeled, 
           -thinly slice; d
    1/2 bn fresh thyme
      3    bay leaves, cracked
      1 tb juniper berries

------------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      1    bones from the pheasants
      4 tb olive oil
  1 1/2 md size unpeeled onions, 
           -quartered
  1 1/2    heads of garlic
      1    two 750 milliliter bottles 
           -zinfande; l
      3 qt strong chicken stock
      6 oz black olives (preferably 
           -kalamata),; pitted
      3    roma tomatoes, peeled, 
           -seeded, chop; ped
      1    salt and pepper, to taste

To remove breast meat and thighs from pheasants, cut down each side of the
ridge of the breastbone with a boning knife. Scrape the knife down the side
of the breast bone and the rib cage to remove meat from the bone. Leave
wings attached. Slit the skin between the knee and top of the breast, then
slip it around to the small of the back. Force the knee down, and soon you
will see the ball joint where the leg-thigh meets the small of the back,
Cut through the knee joint. Run tip of knife along both sides of remaining
thigh bone and pull away from the meat. A boneless thigh portion, skin-on
and rather square shaped, and a skin-on boneless breast with wing attached
remain. Reserve bones for stock. Mix marinade ingredients and pour over
pheasant. Marinate 2 to 3 hours. The sauce: Crack reserved bones with the
blunt edge of a heavy knife. Heat the olive oil in a 5-quart stock pot
until oil is smoking hot. Add bones and brown, stirring constantly. After
10 minutes bones should begin to take on a golden brown color. Keep
stirring so ingredients don't burn. Add onions and garlic and cook
approximately 10 minutes longer, until onions and garlic have caramelized,
and the bones have browned. Spoon excess oil from pot, and add Zinfandel,
stirring to dislodge browned bits from bottom of pot. Reduce heat to medium
and cook until liquid reduces in volume and becomes syrupy. Add chicken
stock, bring to a boil, and cook until sauce has reduced to 3 or 4 cups.
Strain. Sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon. When ready to serve,
reheat sauce with the olives and tomatoes. Season to taste with pepper and
salt. Lift pheasant from marinade and scrape off any solids clinging to the
meat. Season with salt and pepper. Sear meat skin side down until golden.
Turn and repeat. Roast pheasant in a 400 degrees F. oven for 10 to 12
minutes. Breast meat will be finished first and should feel plump and
tender to the touch. Thigh meat must be cooked through and will need a few
more minutes to cook. Serve 1 breast and 1 thigh per person. Drizzle olive
sauce over meat.

      Title: Fred's Muskrat
 Categories: game
      Yield: 4 servings

      4    muskrats (all fat and glands
           - remove; d)
    1/2 lb bacon
    1/2    celery bunch, chopped
      4    onions, chopped
    1/2 lb oleo
    1/2 ts cayenne pepper
      1    salt
      1    pepper
     21 oz tomato soup (2 standard 
           -cans)

Saute bacon, celery, onions, oleo and cayenne pepper together for 10
minutes.

Put rats in bottom of a pan you can cover tightly (my mother makes a double
batch and uses the roaster she cooks turkey in).  Pour sauteed mixture over
the rats, and then cover with tomato soup.  (Don't add water to the soup.)

Bake, covered, for 2 1/2 hours at 350 degrees F or until done.

NOTES:

*  Muskrat roasted in tomato sauce -- In northwestern Ohio and downriver
Detroit, we have "muskrat suppers" in the winter, sponsored by churches and
volunteer fire departments to raise money, rather the way other people have
chicken and ham dinners.  This recipe comes from Fred Witty, via the
cookbook put out by my parents' church.

Legend has it that during the depression, the Bishop of Detroit declared
muskrats to be fish (since they live in the water), so they could be eaten
by Catholics on Fridays.

*  Muskrats are small rodents that live in swamp and build beaver-like
houses out of cat-tails and mud. In New Jersey and Ohio, at least, they are
trapped for their fur; I suspect that knowing a trapper is the only way you
can get muskrats.

*  The recipe book I have has a recipe for muskrats for a crowd, that (for
20 rats) uses the above ingredients (but quantities unspecified, except it
only uses about 1/4 lb oleo), plus chopped green and red peppers, garlic
salt, 5 bouillon cubes and 3 bay leaves. Around Detroit, muskrats are
cooked with cabbage and potatoes, and some folks at home roast them with
apples and onions.

: Difficulty:  easy once you have the muskrats.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.
: Precision:  count the muskrats.

** See recipe for Duck Stock and / or Duck Demi-glaze.

Duck: =====

Preheat your oven to 450 F.

Bone the duck, reserving any unused parts for the stock.  Trim the
breasts, salt and pepper well.  Add the trimming to the other bones and
such reserved for stock.

In a saute pan, heat the butter over medium heat.  Place the breasts
in the pan, skin side down, to melt the fat between the skin and the meat.
(About one or two minutes.) Increase the heat to high, and brown lightly.
Place the pan of breasts in the oven and cook for
8    minutes.

Wine Sauce: ===========

In a copper pan, melt 4 ounces of butter and add the shallots and
peppercorns.  Cook briefly ( 1 to 2 minutes).

Add cepes and Cabernet Sauvignon.  Reduce slightly.

Add duck stock or demi-glace and tomatoes, if desired.  Cook 20 -
30    minutes over medium heat.

Add butter if desired, whip, and reserve.

Bone Marrow: ============

Fill a sauce pan with water, add a touch of salt, then bring the
salted water to a boil.  Add marrow and cook for about 5 minutes. Reserve.

Spinach: ========

Blanch the spinach in hot, salted water, then press slightly to dry.

In a saute pan, heat the butter until brown (beurre rosette - hazelnut
in color).  Add spinach, then nutmeg, salt and pepper.  Cook for about 20
seconds (spinach should have just started to wilt). Drain and reserve.

To serve: =========

Spoon the wine sauce into a pool on the serving plate.  Add bone
marrow to the sauce.  Trim any bone from the duck breasts and place the
breasts skin side down on a cutting surface and slice very thin.

Fan the duck slices out on the serving plate in the sauce, and garnish
with watercress and spinach in a side dish.

      Title: Braised Wild Duck Breasts In A Spiced Wine Sauce
 Categories: poultry, game, casseroles
      Yield: 4 servings

      4    duck breasts; whole, with 
           -ribs and back
      4    bacon strips
      1 cl garlic; finely minced
      1 ts dried parsley
    1/2 ts dried thyme
    1/2 ts marjoram
      1    salt
      1    freshly ground coarse black 
           -pepper
      1    bay leaf
    1/2 c  onion; coarsely chopped
     10 oz can mushrooms and juice
    1/2 c  sven's glogg*
    1/2 c  chicken stock

* A spiced wine, which see, or sub red wine that has had a pinch each
orange peel, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and anise steeped in it.

Pre-heat oven to 400. Place the skinned breasts in a casserole. Lay 2 half
strips of bacon over each breast. Sprinkle the seasonings over the birds
and then the onions and mushrooms. Pour the mushroom juice, wine and a
little stock over all and cover the casserole. Bake for 20 minutes. Reduce
the oven temperature to 300 and bake for a further 55 minutes.

This dish tastes even better if it is allowed to cool slowly with the
breasts marinading in the stock and re-heated the next day for serving.

Alternatively the cold cooked breasts can be boned; the stock thickened
with cornstarch or flour and the breast medallions heated briefly in the
simmering gravy and served on toast.

      Title: Roast Goose With Potato Pierogies
 Categories: game
      Yield: 10 servings

      1    goose (about 10 pounds); 
           -thawed
      7 ts thyme, dried; divided
      1 ts salt
      1 ts black pepper
      4 tb oil; divided
     32 oz pierogies, potato (2 pkgs)
      2 c  onion; chopped
      2 tb flour
      2 c  chicken broth

Preheat the oven to 400F.  Remove the neck and giblets; remove any large
pieces of fat from inside the goose and neck cavity; reserve the neck and
liver. Rinse the goose and pat dry with paper towels. In a small bowl,
combine 2 tablespoons thyme and the salt and pepper. Rub the bird with 2
tablespoons oil, then rub with the thyme mixture. Tuck the wings under and
tie the legs together.  Place the goose, breast- side up, on a rack in a
large roasting pan.  Pierce the skin all over with a 2-tined fork.

Roast the goose for 1 hour. During roasting, pierce the skin several times
with a fork.  To keep the fat from smoking, remove from the pan with a
baster or dip out with a cooking spoon.  Reduce the oven temperature to
325F. Roast for 2 to 2 1/2 hours longer, or until the internal temperature
registers 180 to 185 on a meat thermometer, and the juices run clear when
the bird is pierced with a knife. Continue to pierce the skin and remove
the fat while roasting. While the goose is roasting, finely chop the neck
meat and liver for making the gravy. Refrigerate until ready to use.

When the goose is almost done, set a large pot of water to boil. Cook the
pierogies according to the package directions. Meanwhile, in a large
skillet, saute the onions in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until golden;
remove from heat.  Drain the pierogies well; add the cooked onions. Mix
lightly to combine. Cover and keep warm. Place the goose on a large serving
platter; cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Remove the remaining fat
from the pan and place the pan drippings into a glass measure; let any fat
rise to the surface and discard. Reserve 1/3 cup of the drippings. Set the
roasting pan on top of the stove. Add the reserved drippings. Saute the
chopped neck meat and liver for 5 minutes or until cooked. Blend in the
flour; cook, stirring constantly, until bubbly. Stir in the broth; cook and
stir until the mixture thickens and bubbles, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the
remaining teaspoon of thyme.  Pour into a gravy boat.  Arrange the pierogie
around the goose or place in a separate bowl.  Serve with gravy.

    1/2 c  oil, olive, extra-virgin
      1    salt (to taste)
      1    pepper (to taste)
      1 c  wine, white, dry
      2 c  stock, chicken, dark **
      8 ea garlic, cloves, peeled
      1 tb oil, olive, extra-virgin
    3/4 ts arrowroot or
    3/4 ts cornstarch
      1 tb water, cold
  1 1/2 tb brandy
      1    roast beef puree **
      1    spinach ***
      1    beet greens ***

** See recipes for Brown Chicken Stock and Roast Beef Puree.

*** Blanch 1 1/2 pounds of fresh spinach, stems removed, and reserved
greens from 4 beets.  Drain, rinse under cold water and squeeze out all of
the liquid.  Toss the greens in a skillet over medium-high beat with 2
tablespoons of butter and until heated through. Season with salt.

To Marinate: ============

You can do this yourself, or you can ask your butcher to cut up your
rabbit as follows: forelegs left whole, hind legs cut into 3 pieces each
(lower joint; thigh cut diagonally into 2 pieces), rib section cut into 3
pieces, loin cut into 3 pieces, neck left whole. At least 2 days before
serving, place the rabbit in a shallow glass or enamel pan and add marinade
ingredients.  Turn rabbit pieces over to coat.  Marinate, covered, in
refrigerator, turning occasionally.

Preheat you oven to 325 F. Remove the rabbit from the marinade. In a
heavy large skillet, heat about 1/4 cup of olive oil over medium-high heat.
Add half of the rabbit pieces and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Saute,
turning pieces once, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to
oven-proof casserole.  Discard fat from skillet and add 1/2 cup of white
wine, scraping up all of the browned bits in the pan.  Boil for 2 minutes
and add the liquids out of the skillet to the casserole.  Repeat the
procedure, browning the remaining rabbit, deglazing and adding rabbit and
liquid to the casserole.

Bring the brown chicken stock to a boil; skim, if necessary, and pour
it into the casserole (liquid should not quite cover meat). Place the
casserole, partially covered, in the lower third of the oven.  After 50
minutes, check the forelegs, racks and loins.  If they are tender, remove
them.  Continue cooking until all of the remaining pieces are tender, 1 to
1 1/2 hours total cooking time (timing can vary depending on size and
tenderness of the rabbit). Transfer to serving plates and keep warm.

Meanwhile, blanch the garlic in boiling salted water for 30 seconds;
drain.  Blanch again for 30 seconds, drain.  Place in a small skillet with
1 tablespoon of olive oil and saute over high heat for 1 minute.

Place the skillet in the oven until the garlic is golden, 25 to 30
minutes.  Cut each clove into 3 or 4 pieces; set aside.

When the rabbit is tender, place the skillet with cooking liquid over
high heat and boil until reduced by half, about 15 minutes.  Skim all of
the fat from the surface.  In a small cup, stir together the arrowroot and
water; whisk the mixture into the reduced cooking liquid and return to a
boil.  Add brandy, adjust seasonings with salt and pepper, and skim again
if necessary.  Stir in the reserved garlic pieces, and pour over the
rabbit.

Serve your rabbit with Roast Beef Puree, spinach and beet greens.

------------------------------------LEEKS-----------------------------------
      2 md leeks
      1 tb butter
      1    salt (to taste)

** The "saddle of a rabbit" is the rabbit's back from the first rib to
the beginning of the legs.

Marinade: =========

Put the saddle of the rabbit in a small bowl with 1 cup of white wine
and 1 sprig of rosemary.  Chop the carrot, onion, celery, and garlic add
them to the marinade.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and store in the
refrigerator for 24 - 48 hours.  (The longer the better for the flavor of
the rabbit meat.)

Rabbit: =======

Preheat your oven to 450 F.

Remove the rabbit from the marinade and dry with a cloth.  Salt and
pepper the rabbit.

In a medium roasting pan, add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon
of olive oil.  Heat the mixture until the butter sizzles.

Place the rabbit in the pan, skin side up, and brown.  Turn, wrapping
flaps around the filet to protect it, and cook until light brown. Place the
pan in the 450 F oven and cook for 10 minutes, until medium rare. Baste
often.

Add the vegetables from the marinade to the pan with the rabbit and
cook for another 5 minutes, basting and turning occasionally.

Remove the rabbit from the pan and place it aside in a warm location.
Trim the saddle flaps from the rabbit and chop the flaps coarsely.

Sauce: ======

Return the chopped flaps to the pan with the vegetables.  On the stove
top, saute briefly and skim the fat.

Deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup of wine, add the rabbit stock and reduce
by one-half.

Add the tomato and saute while stirring.  Strain the hot mixture
through a sieve, reserving the liquid (for sauce) and discarding the
vegetables. Add the butter to the liquid and whisk until smooth.

Leeks: ======

Julienne the leeks.  Rinse in cold water and drain well.

In a medium saute pan, add 1 tablespoon butter and leeks.  Cook slowly
for 2 - 5 minutes.  Leeks should remain crisp.  Adjust the seasonings and
set the leeks aside in a warm place.

Assembly: =========

Remove the filet of rabbit from the saddle.  Cut the saddle bone
crosswise and place one section on each of two plates.  Surround the saddle
bones with leeks.

Cut the filet of rabbit into very thin slices lengthwise.  Fan slices
on top of the leeks.

Cover with sauce, garnish with sprigs of rosemary.  Serve immediately.

used as substitute.

Put the ingredients for the red curry paste into a mortar and pound until
well mixed into a paste.  NOTE: You may use commercially available paste,
if available. Adjust the amount to taste.

Debone the roast duck, and cut up the meat into bite-size rectangular
pieces (leaving the skin on). Cut the neck and wing into pieces.

Place the coconut milk in a large saucepan and heat till boiling. Add duck
pieces and cook till tender. Put the coconut cream into a frying pan, add
red curry paste. Heat over fairly high heat, stiring constantly, till all
the paste have mixed in and thoroughly heated. Add Kaffir Lime leaves, fish
sauce (to taste), coconut sugar, and continue to heat (keep stiring all the
time to prevent burning) until red oil starts to form on the surface of the
"sauce".

Add the "sauce" to the saucepan of duck and coconut milk, and bring back to
a boil.  Add all remaining ingredients except the basils, which is to be
added when the curry starts to boil. Remove from heat and serve with plain
boiled white rice.

      Title: Lencseleves Fogoyhussal (Lentil Soup With Par
 Categories: poultry, soups, game, hungarian
      Yield: 6 servings

      2 ea partridges
      1 c  lentils
      6 c  broth, chicken
      1 lb veal bones
      1 md carrots; peeled
      1 ea parsnip; peeled
      1 ea celery knob; peeled
    1/4 lb bacon, smoked
      2 tb flour, all-purpose
      1 sm onions; chopped
    1/2 ts mustard, prepared
    1/3 c  heavy cream

Soak partridges in cold water 3-4 hours. Place lentils in soup pot with
chicken broth, veal bones, carrot, parsnip and celery. Slowly bring to a
boil.
Cut smoked bacon into small dice and render fat. With slotted spoon
remove cracklings and set aside.
Dry partridges. Very quickly brown the whole bird in the bacon drippings,
giving them some color. Remove partridges and place in soup pot with
lentils.
Make a roux with the same fat used to brown the partridges and the flour
and onion. Add 1/2 cup cold water and whip until smooth.
When partridges and lentils are done, about 2 hours, add liquified roux.
Cook for an additional 10 minutes. Take out partridges and bone them.
Replace meat chunks in soup. Just before serving, whip mustard and cream
into the soup.

Note: partridges can be one of the toughest birds in the world, and the 2
hour cooking time may be longer. This is an excellent way to prepare what
would otherwise be a very tough bird.

From "The Art of South American Cooking," by Felipe Rojas-Lombar.

Wipe rabbits inside and out with a damp cloth. Remove and set aside kidneys
and hearts. Cut each rabbit into 3 sections: hind legs, loin and front
legs; separate legs, leaving loin in 1 piece.

Heat olive oil in a saute pan; add rabbit and saute over medium heat for 20
minutes, or until brown on all sides, turning frequently. Set aside. Pour
off all but 1/4 cup oil from pan. Add garlic and onions and saute over
medium heat, stirring, until onions start to turn golden, about 10 minutes.
Add celery, carrot, cloves, cardamom and cayenne. Add port, stir and cook
until evaporated. Add sausages and cook 1 minute. Add chocolate, stir,
sprinkle flour on top and cook another minute, stirring. Add 3 cups stock
and the salt; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat; simmer
about 25 minutes, until thickened, stirring now and then. Add remaining
stock and bring to a boil over medium heat. Add rabbit and giblets. Lower
heat to minimum, cover, and cook for 1 hour and 10 minutes, stirring now
and then and scraping bottom of pan, or until rabbit is tender and sauce is
enriched and has thickened again. Transfer to a serving platter, sprinkle
with cilantro, and serve.

Note: Morcilla sausages often can be found at Hispanic groceries, including
those in San Francisco's Mission District.

      Title: Saddle Of Rabbit With Leeks & Rosemary
 Categories: game
      Yield: 2 servings

------------------------MARINADE, RABBIT, AND SAUCE-------------------------
      3 lb rabbit, use only the - 
           -saddle secti; on **
      1 sm carrot
    1/2 md onion
      1    celery, stalk
      1    garlic, clove, crushed
      2    rosemary, fresh, sprigs
      1 tb oil, olive
      2 tb butter
  1 1/3 c  wine, white
      1 c  stock, rabbit or
      1 c  bouillon, chicken
      1 md tomato, sliced
      1    salt (to taste)
      1    pepper (to taste)

------------------------------------LEEKS-----------------------------------
      2 md leeks
      1 tb butter
      1    salt (to taste)

** The "saddle of a rabbit" is the rabbit's back from the first rib to
the beginning of the legs.

Marinade: =========

Put the saddle of the rabbit in a small bowl with 1 cup of white wine
and 1 sprig of rosemary.  Chop the carrot, onion, celery, and garlic add
them to the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and store in the
refrigerator for 24 - 48 hours.  (The longer the better for the flavor of
the rabbit meat.)

Rabbit: =======

Preheat your oven to 450 F.

Remove the rabbit from the marinade and dry with a cloth. Salt and
pepper the rabbit.

In a medium roasting pan, add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon
of olive oil.  Heat the mixture until the butter sizzles.

Place the rabbit in the pan, skin side up, and brown. Turn, wrapping
flaps around the filet to protect it, and cook until light brown. Place the
pan in the 450 F oven and cook for 10 minutes, until medium rare. Baste
often.

Add the vegetables from the marinade to the pan with the rabbit and
cook for another 5 minutes, basting and turning occasionally.

Remove the rabbit from the pan and place it aside in a warm location.
Trim the saddle flaps from the rabbit and chop the flaps coarsely.

Sauce: ======

Return the chopped flaps to the pan with the vegetables. On the stove
top, saute briefly and skim the fat.

Deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup of wine, add the rabbit stock and reduce
by one-half.

Add the tomato and saute while stirring.  Strain the hot mixture
through a sieve, reserving the liquid (for sauce) and discarding the
vegetables. Add the butter to the liquid and whisk until smooth.

Leeks: ======

Julienne the leeks.  Rinse in cold water and drain well.

In a medium saute pan, add 1 tablespoon butter and leeks. Cook slowly
for 2 - 5 minutes.  Leeks should remain crisp. Adjust the seasonings and
set the leeks aside in a warm place.

Assembly: =========

Remove the filet of rabbit from the saddle.  Cut the saddle bone
crosswise and place one section on each of two plates. Surround the saddle
bones with leeks.

Cut the filet of rabbit into very thin slices lengthwise. Fan slices
on top of the leeks.

Cover with sauce, garnish with sprigs of rosemary. Serve immediately.

      Title: Char-Grilled Kangaroo Kebabs And Smoked Eggplant
 Categories: game, australian
      Yield: 6 servings

  1 1/3 lb kangaroo fillet, trimmed and
           - cubed
      2 ts coriander seeds, roasted and
           - ground
      1 ts black pepper, freshly ground

  1 2/3 tb lemon juice
      1 tb tahini
    1/2 ts sea salt
  1 3/4 oz yoghurt, plain
      2 ts parsley leaves, chopped.

Roll the cubes of kangaroo meat in the ground coriander seed and black
pepper, coating lightly. Skewer meat and put on an oiled tray until ready
to cook. Grill the eggplants until skins are black and blistered. Cool
slightly and skin them while still warm. Squeeze out the bitter juices.
Mash the flesh with a large fork gradually adding the garlic, lemon juice,
tahini, sea salt, parsley and yoghurt. Grill the kebabs under (or over)
high heat, brushing with oil to keep moist being careful not to toughen the
meat. Spoon the eggplant puree onto the plates. Remove skewers and pile the
meat cubes onto the puree. Serve immediately.

 Categories: game
      Yield: 4 servings

----------------------------INDIAN BREAD STICKS-----------------------------
    1/2 c  low-fat milk, warmed
      2 ts baking powder
      3    green onions, finely chopped
      1 ts salt
      1 ts cracked black pepper
  1 1/2 c  all-purpose flour
      1    nonstick vegetable spray

----------------------------------STIRFRY-----------------------------------
      8 oz buffalo or beef flank steak
      1 tb oriental sesame oil
      1 tb chopped fresh ginger
      1    clove garlic, finely chopped
      1 sm carrot, julienne cut
    1/2    poblano chile **
    1/2 sm red onion, julienne cut
      2 bn watercress (8 ounces) ***

* stem, seeds and membrane removed, chopped (see note) ** seeds and
membranes removed, julienne cut (see note) *** stems removed, thoroughly
washed and drained (4 cups)

This recipe comes from the Stonehouse Restaurant at San Ysidro Ranch in
California. It's an example of how executive chef Gerard Thompson combines
ingredients, flavors and textures of diverse ethnic origins.

To make sauce: Combine black beans, chicken stock, ginger, garlic, chile
and vinegar in a medium-size saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high
heat. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until beans are tender, about 1
hour. Pour into blender or food processor, add the salt and blend until
smooth.

To make breadsticks: While sauce is simmering, preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Combine warm milk, baking powder, green onions, salt and pepper; mix well.
Add flour and knead until the dough becomes smooth, adding more flour if
needed, about 3 to 5 minutes. Allow to rest
30    minutes at room temperature.

Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a bread stick and
place them on a baking sheet that has been sprayed with nonstick vegetable
coating. Lightly spray the bread sticks with the nonstick coating and bake
until golden brown on the bottom, about 10 to 15 minutes. Turn bread sticks
over and bake until other side is lightly browned, about 5 more minutes.

To make stir-fry: Trim all visible fat from meat and cut, against the
grain, into quarter-inch strips. Place oil in a nonstick skillet or wok
over high heat. Immediately add meat and toss two times. Add ginger and
garlic and toss two more times. Add carrot, chile and onion, toss twice
more and remove from heat. Add watercress and toss again to mix well.

To serve: Spoon 1/2 cup sauce onto each of four warm plates. Top with 1 cup
of meat mixture and arrange 3 bread sticks in a triangular pattern on each
plate.

Note: When preparing fresh chilies, wear rubber gloves for protection
against oils that later can cause burning sensation on skin.

Makes 4 servings.

      4    game hens
      1    salt, pepper to taste
      1    olive oil
      4    garlic cloves, finely 
           -chopped
      1 tb red wine vinegar
      3 c  chicken stock
    1/2 c  dry vermouth
      2    white onions, coarsely 
           -chopped
      2    not-too-ripe bosc pears, 
           -peeled, ha; lved, cored
     12    to 16 whole chestnuts 
           -(prepared, fr; om ajar)
      2 oz bitter chocolate, grated
      8    triangles of fried bread 
           -(see note)
      1    raisins, chopped parsley for
           - garnis; h

This recipe was inspired by one using partridges that appeared in "The
Taste of Spain," by Camilla Jessel.

Season hens with salt and pepper. Heat a bit of oil in a large heavy pan
and brown the birds in it on all sides. Add garlic to pan and stir until it
takes on a pale color. Add vinegar, 2 cups of the stock, the vermouth and
onions and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover tightly and cook gently until
birds are very tender, about 1 hour.

Heat remaining cup of stock in a pan large enough to hold the pear halves.
Add pears and poach until barely tender; remove with a slotted spoon and
keep warm. Add chestnuts to poaching liquid and simmer until heated
through; remove and keep warm.

Remove birds to a heated serving platter or plates. Strain cooking liquid,
return to heat and add grated chocolate, stirring until it is a good sauce
consistency. Pour over birds and garnish with pears, chestnuts, the fried
bread, a few raisins and some chopped parsley.

Note: To make fried bread, cut crusts from 4 slices of white bread, then
cut slices diagonally to make 8 triangles. Fry quickly in a little hot oil
until golden on both sides. Drain and keep warm.

      Title: Venison Steaks With Chestnuts & Figs
 Categories: game
      Yield: 4 servings

      1    stephen ceideburg
    1/2 tb butter
      1    black pepper
     50 g  chopped green onions
    200 ml port wine
    300 ml stock
     24    peeled chestnuts
      1 tb butter
      8    venison medallions
      4    figs

By rights, this dish requires lengthy preparation of a stock made with the
bones and trimmings of venison. However, this is impossible for most of us
who buy venison as a boneless fillet.

A good beef stock is a satisfactory substitute and if you use a canned beef
bouillon (Campbells makes one) and prepare the chestnuts in advance, the
meal can be prepared very rapidly.

Melt half a tablespoon of butter in a heavy saucepan, add a good grinding
of black pepper and gently cook 50 g chopped green (spring) onions. Add 200
mL port and reduce. Add 300 mL stock and 24 peeled chestnuts and simmer for
about 20 minutes or until the sauce becomes syrupy. Set aside and keep
warm.

Heat a heat a heavy-based frying pan, add a tablespoon of butter. When it
is very hot, cook 8 medallions of venison, each about 1 cm thick.

Sear them for a maximum of 1 minute on each side, to ensure they are still
rare.

Meanwhile, butter a baking tray and slice onto it 4 figs. Place under a
grill to heat through.

Divide the sauce and chestnuts between four heated plates and add to each
plate 2 medallions of venison and a fan of fig slices. Serve immediately.

      Title: Partridge With Mole Sauce
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 8 servings

      1    stephen ceideburg
      4    partridges, about 1 lb. each
    1/4 c  all-purpose white flour
      1    salt and freshly ground 
           -black peppe; r to taste
      2 tb olive oil
      1 sm onion, chopped
      2    cloves garlic, minced
      3 tb minced fresh cilantro
  1 1/4 c  defatted chicken stock or 
           -water
      2    canned or fresh plum 
           -tomatoes, coar; sely choppe
      1    bay leaf
    1/2 ts dried thyme
    1/2 ts cinnamon
    1/4 c  pepitas (green pumpkin 
           -seeds)
    1/2    dried mild dried pepper
      1    chipotle pepper or to taste,
           - seeds; removed
    1/2 oz unsweetened chocolate, 
           -chopped

This is a strong sauce, but partridge is an intensely flavored bird and is
equal to it. Serve with rice or soft flour tortillas. Note: Pasilla and
ancho peppers can be ordered from Dean & DeLuca, 560 Broadway, New York, NY
10012, (800) 221-7714.

Tie partridge legs together and secure to the body with a toothpick.
Combine flour, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge
partridges in flour mixture. Heat oil in a deep casserole with a lid over
medium-high heat. Brown partridge in batches, turning, for about 5 minutes.
Set aside. Add to the pot onions, garlic, 1 Tbsp. cilantro and 1/4 cup
stock or water and cook for about 2 minutes, or until softened. Add
tomatoes, bay leaf, thyme, cinnamon and remaining 1 cup stock or water.
Return birds to the pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat and cover. Simmer,
basting occasionally, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the birds are tender
and their juices run clear when they are pierced with a fork.

Meanwhile, roast pepitas over medium heat in a small, dry skillet, stirring
frequently, for about 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Set aside. Roast
pasilla and chipotle peppers in the same skillet for about 30 to
40    seconds until fragrant.

Remove birds from the casserole dish and cool slightly. With poultry
shears, cut them in half, discarding the back bone. Set aside and cover
with foil to keep warm. Boil the sauce over high heat for 5 to 10 minutes,
stirring often, until it has been reduced to 1 cup. Add pepitas, dried
peppers and chipotles to the cooking liquid and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.
Remove bay leaf and transfer the sauce to a blender or food processor. Add
chocolate and blend until smooth. If the sauce seems too thick, add a
little stock or water.

Return the sauce to the casserole dish and heat through briefly over low
heat. Taste for seasoning: it should be smoky, hot and slightly bitter. Nap
the birds with the sauce and garnish with the remaining 2 Tbsp. cilantro.

      2 ts salt
    1/2 ts freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts dried thyme leaves
      8 qt split and flattened
    1/2 c  (1 stick) unsalted butter
    1/2 c  virginia ham, cut into 2 by 
           -1/4 inc; h matchsticks

First, make the fresh white grape juice.  Crush the cup of grapes in a
pestle, then put through a sieve or vegetable mill to extract the juice, or
use a potato ricer. Combine the salt, pepper, and thyme, crushing the thyme
with your fingertips.  Sprinkle both sides of the birds with the
seasonings. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat until it
foams and just begins to brown. Add the quail, skin-side down. Sprinkle
with ham, cover and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the skin is golden
brown. Turn the birds and continue cooking, covered, until the juices run
clear, about 4 minutes longer. Take the pan from the heat and let the quail
rest, covered, for about 10 minutes. Arrange the quail on a platter and
sprinkle the ham from the pan over them. Pour the fat from the pan. Add the
grape juice (you can also use water, if you prefer), and bring to a boil.
Cook for 1 minute, scraping the browned bits from the bottom to deglaze the
pan.  Pour over the quail and serve.

      Title: Tawny Roasted Pheasants
 Categories: game
      Yield: 4 servings

      2    pheasants, about 2 1/2 lb ea
      2    oranges; halved
    1/4 c  olive oil
      1    salt to taste
      1    pepper to taste
      8    sprigs flat-leaf parsley
      4    garlic cloves; peeled and 
           -bruised
      2    bay leaves
     12 sl bacon
    1/2 c  defatted chicken broth
    1/4 c  tawny port
      1    autumn pear salsa (see 
           -separate rec; ipe)

When cooking pheasant or any wild game birds, I always squeeze an orange or
two in the cavity and on the outside to refresh the bird before cooking. As
the meat is very lean, it's necessary to cover the breast with bacon to add
extra moisture during roasting. Basting with liquid from the pan also is
essential. - Shiela Lukins

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

2. Rinse the pheasants, cleaning the cavities well. Remove any excess fat.
Pat dry.

3. Squeeze the oranges all over the birds and inside the cavities. Brush
with olive oil and sprinkle inside and out with salt and pepper. Place 4
sprigs of parsley, 2 cloves of garlic and a bay leaf in each cavity.

4. Place the birds in a shallow roasting pan to fit. Arrange 6 slices of
bacon over each pheasant.  Add the chicken broth and the port to the pan.

5. Bake for 1 1/2 hours (remove the bacon after an hour), basting two or
three times.  Then bake 15-20 minutes longer or until the breasts are brown
and the birds are cooked through. (The juices should run clear when the
thickest part of the thigh is tested with the tip of a knife.) Let rest 10
minutes. Carve and serve with Autumn Pear Salsa.

      Title: Goose With Sauce Madame
 Categories: game
      Yield: 8 servings

      1    goose
      1 ts sage
      1 ts parsley
      1 ts hyssop (or mint)
      1 ts savory
      1    pear, hard; peeled, cored & 
           -chopped
      1    quince; pared, cored & chop
      2    garlic clove; finely minced
      1 c  grape, seedless
    1/4 c  bread crumbs
    1/2 ts cinnamon
    1/4 ts ginger
    1/4 c  vinegar
    1/4 c  wine, red
    1/2 ts salt; or to taste

Stuff the goose with a mixture of the fruits, herbs, and garlic; sew or
skewer closed, and roast on a rack in an open roasting pan at 325 degrees
for 30 minutes per pound. Pour off the fat as it accumulates, and set aside
When goose is about done, make a sauce by blending together the breadcrumbs
vinegar, spices, and wine, with a little of the accumulated fat (about 1/4
cup is probably as much as most people would find palatable). Pour over the
goose, or serve separately.

      Title: Braised Wild Duck Breasts In A Spiced Wine Sa
 Categories: poultry, game, casseroles
      Yield: 4 servings

      4    duck breasts; whole, with 
           -ribs and back
      4    bacon strips
      1 cl garlic; finely minced
      1 ts dried parsley
    1/2 ts dried thyme
    1/2 ts marjoram
      1    salt
      1    freshly ground coarse black 
           -pepper
      1    bay leaf
    1/2 c  onion; coarsely chopped
     10 oz can mushrooms and juice
    1/2 c  sven's glogg*
    1/2 c  chicken stock

* A spiced wine, which see, or sub red wine that has had a pinch each
orange peel, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and anise steeped in it.

Pre-heat oven to 400. Place the skinned breasts in a casserole. Lay 2 half
strips of bacon over each breast. Sprinkle the seasonings over the birds
and then the onions and mushrooms. Pour the mushroom juice, wine and a
little stock over all and cover the casserole. Bake for 20 minutes. Reduce
the oven temperature to 300 and bake for a further 55 minutes.

This dish tastes even better if it is allowed to cool slowly with the
breasts marinading in the stock and re-heated the next day for serving.

Alternatively the cold cooked breasts can be boned; the stock thickened
with cornstarch or flour and the breast medallions heated briefly in the
simmering gravy and served on toast.

Here's another recipe designed to reduce the toughest and oldest game birds
to tender, succulent meat.  Whenever Parp comes home with an odd assortment
of game birds, this is how he prepares them.

Preheat oven to 325F.  Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet, 1 tablespoon at a
time, and lightly brown the game bird pieces.  Place the browned pieces in
a baking dish.  Add Wildfowl Stock, sauteed onions, and honey. Sprinkle
Rosemary in top.

Cover and bake for 1 hour.  Remove cover and add yogurt by the spoonful.
Return to oven and bake, uncovered, for an additional 20 minutes.

Remove meat from baking dish.  Blend flour and milk in a jar.  Blend this
mixture into the pan liquid.  Simmer over moderate heat for 5 minutes. Pour
sauce over meat and serve with Steamed Wild Rice.

Yield: 4 servings.

      Title: Rabbit En Gelee
 Categories: appetizers, game, ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings

      1    young hare or
      2    fleshy rabbits - (about 4 
           -lbs. tota; l)
      2    envelopes unflavored gelatin
    1/4 c  ; water
      6    carrots; peeled
      1    bottle dry white wine
      1 tb white wine vinegar
    1/2    lemon; zest of
      1    freshly ground black pepper
      2    bay leaves
      3    sprigs fresh thyme
      6    sprigs fresh italian parsley
      1    onion; halved
      1    head garlic; peeled
     24 sm onions
      6    whole french green beans - 
           -(up to 8; )
    1/4 c  white madeira wine
      1 pn ground cinnamon
     12    pickled onions
      2 tb chopped fresh chives
    1/4 c  fresh chervil leaves
      2 tb chopped fresh fennel leaves
      1    salt; to taste

----------------------------------GARNISHES---------------------------------
      1    fresh italian parsley
      1    poppyseed, kiwi or
      1    black currants

Cut the legs from each rabbit, then split the body into 2 pieces.  In a
small bowl, soften the gelatin in the water.  Slice 2 of the carrots. Place
the rabbit, gelatin, wine, vinegar, lemon zest, a few grinds of pepper, bay
leaves, thyme, parsley, sliced carrots, onion and garlic in a large pot.
Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and
simmer until the meat falls from the bones, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

While the rabbit is stewing, in separate saucepans cook the remaining whole
carrots and the small onions in boiling water until just tender, about 15
minutes.  In another pot, cook the beans for 5 minutes. Drain the
vegetables, rinse under cold running water, and set aside.

When done, remove the rabbit and vegetables from the pot with a slotted
spoon.  Strain the cooking liquid into a bowl, stir in the Madeira, and set
aside.

Remove the rabbit meat from the bones and cut any large chunks into
bite-size pieces.  Sprinkle with a little cinnamon.  Slice the crisp-tender
carrots and small onions and reserve separately.  Let all ingredients cool
to room temperature.

Coat the inside of a shallow round 2-quart mold with a layer of the cooking
liquid and let it set.  Arrange crisp-tender carrot slices over the bottom
and around the sides of the mold.  Then layer the rabbit pieces, remaining
carrots, cooked onions, garlic cloves, pickled onions, beans and herbs in
the mold, arranging them so they will appealing when it is cut. Season with
salt and pepper, and pour the remaining cooking liquid into the mold to
cover the meat and vegetables. Place in the refrigerator to set, 4 to 6
hours.

Carefully turn the mold out onto a platter and gently press Italian parsley
leaves into the aspic before serving.  You can decorate it further with
poppyseeds or the other garnishes.

Note: The liquid in which the rabbit cooks becomes a delicious aspic in
this terrine.

The authors write: "'I like meals to be a feast,' says Aude Clement, owner
of one of Paris's most intriguing houseware stores, Au Bain Marie. Aude's
love of good food goes back to her childhood, when birthdays were occasions
for a splendid meal at Fernand Point's celebrated restaurant. 'My father
always drank good wine,' she adds, 'and he always gave me a taste.'

"Aude has pursued her love of food in her work as well, developing articles
on cooking for leading French magazines, then styling them for photography.
While searching for interesting props, she became intrigued with the
beautiful but useful antiques related to preparing and serving food.
Eventually she amassed enough of them to open a shop devoted to the table.

"As busy as she is, Aude still manages to find time to cook.  Every
Saturday morning she searches the weekly market in Lac d'Enghien, the small
spa town near Paris where she lives, for the best produce, fish, and meats.
'I like everything that's good,' she says. Arriving home, the morning's
purchases are unpacked on the long counter to inspire her. Any fish is
washed, dried, then lightly salted. 'It's a trick I learned from the
Japanese,' says Aude.  'The fish keeps better and the flesh is firmer.'"

"'I cook by smell,' she notes.  'When you can smell pasta, it's too late.
It will already be overcooked.'  The fragrance of herbs is always an
important consideration in her cooking.  Basil is a favorite, 'but I never
cook it,' she notes."

      Title: Tender Jerky
 Categories: game
      Yield: 1 servings

     10 lb deer, elk, moose, etc., 
           -ground
    2/3 c  curing sugar or curing salt 
           -in a pi; nch
      1 ts cardamom
      1 ts marjoram
      1 tb msg
  1 1/2 ts cayenne pepper
      2 tb black pepper
      3 tb liquid smoke
      2 tb water
    1/2 ts garlic powder

Begin preparation by deboning and removing the tendons and fat from the
meat. It is important that you remove all fat or it will go rancid. Either
grind the meat yourself or have someone grind it for you; a coarse grind
gives the best results. Mix the spices thoroughly and then add the spices a
bit at a time while kneading the meat like dough. Put the meat in the
fridge for at least 6 hours to allow the spices to work through the meat.
At this point you prepare the meat for jerking. If you have an electric
meat slicer, make the meat into logs about 4 x 14"; place the meat in the
fridge until it is solid but not frozen, and then slice 1/8" slices from
end to end. You'll end up with a big stack of circular patties. If you
don't have a slicer, roll the meat out to a 1/8" thickness between two
pieces of wax paper. Remove the top paper and score the meat into strips
and place them in the freezer for about 45 minutes. Remove the meat and
break at the score marks. Place the jerky on wire racks and place them in a
150 F. oven, leaving the door ajar so moisture can escape and the heat does
not build up.  Turn the jerky once or twice during drying and rotate the
racks if the jerky near the elements begins to dry too fast. Meat should be
left slightly pliable, that should take somewhere around 3 or 4 hours to
get to.  Cure yours to whatever point you like; if you like potato chips,
be my guest. Jerky can can be stored for months in the freezer; the drier
it is the longer it lasts. Makes 1 happy camper.

      Title: Coniglio Alla Salvia  (Rabbit With Sage)
 Categories: game, ethnic
      Yield: 4 servings

      4 sl bacon
      3    garlic cloves, peeled
      6    sage leaves, fresh or 1 
           -tablespoon; dried
      2 c  chicken stock
    1/2 c  vegetable oil
      3 lb rabbit, dressed, in 8 pieces
      1    salt
      1    pepper to taste
      1    flour for dredging
      1 ts balsamic vinegar
      1 c  dry white wine

Chop the bacon, garlic and sage very fine, to paste consistancy. (If using
a blender or processor, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of the stock.) Heat the
vegetable oil in a large casserole, meanwhile seasoning the rabbit parts
with salt and pepper and dredging them lightly in flour, shaking off the
excess. Add the rabbit to the casserole and cook over high heat, turning it
until browned, about 3 minutes on per side.

Discard the oil from the casserole. Add the bacon mixture, and return to
the heat, cooking 3 minutes and stirring occasionally. Add the Balsamic
vinegar and white wine, and simmer 5 minutes. Add 1 cup of the stock, salt
and pepper to taste, and cover the casserole. Simmer until the rabbit is
tender, about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding the remaining
stock gradually, as needed, to keep the meat moist. Transfer the rabbit
pieces to a large serving dish and strain the sauce, which should be thick,
over them. If the sauce is thin, quickly reduce it over high heat.

      Title: Roast Rabbit Or Hare  _llb_
 Categories: main dish, meats, game
      Yield: 4 servings

      1 ts salt
      1 ts pepper
    1/2 ts thyme
      1 ts marjoram
      4 lb to 5 lb dressed hare  -or-
      2 ea cottontails
    1/4 lb salt pork; sliced
    1/4 c  dry red wine
      1 tb vinegar
      1 sm onion; chopped
    1/2 c  beef or chicken stock
      1 tb beach plum or red currant 
           -jelly
    1/2 c  heavy cream
      1    pepper
      1 ts flour stirred with.......
      2 tb water

...Rabbits and especially the large hares look appetizing roasted whole...
... In this recipe one may marinate hare for two to three days with your
favorite marinade. If you do marinate, use the strained marinade instead of
the wine and the vinegar.

Mix the salt, pepper, and the two herbs and rub it all on and inside the
hare. Truss the front legs and in doing so, tie on slabs of salt pork over
the saddle [Note this step adds fat to help soften the meat].
In a shallow roasting pan, roast the hare uncovered for about 30 minutes
in a 450 degree F oven. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees and roast another
45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the hare and keep warm.
Place the roasting pan and contents over a medium heat. Add the wine,
vinegar, onion and stock and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes. Add the jelly,
cream, pepper (taste for salt) and quickly dissolve jelly. Stir in the
flour and water paste and let it thicken a bit before serving in a
sauceboat.

      Title: Sweet And Sour Black Bear
 Categories: game
      Yield: 1 text file

      1    no ingredients

Bear meat isn't as common in the average household as other big game but,
if the bear is young and tender and hadn't learned to catch fish it should
taste good enough for anybody. Be sure that bear meat is thoroughly cooked
to avoid trichinosis.

Cube about 2 lbs. of bear meat and sprinkle with salt and pepper, then
dredge with flour.  Brown in a little shortening.  After the bear pieces
are browned, add 1/2 c. water, 1/4 c. wine vinegar and 2 T. soy sauce.
Cover and simmer for an hour or until fork tender.  Now add 1 c. apricot
jam and 1 green pepper, diced, and cook 20 min. longer. Serve over rice.

      1 ts ground ginger
    1/2 ts salt
    1/2 ts ground nutmeg
    1/4 ts ground allspice
      1    pastry (recipe follows)

1. At least 4 hours before making pie, prepare the mincemeat: In heavy

6-inch rectangle. Remove top sheet of paper from pastry. Cut rectangle into
four 9 1/2- by 1 1/2-inch strips.

6. Carefully spoon mincemeat into crust-lined pie plate. Remove pastry
strips from waxed paper, one at a time, and place across mincemeat to
create spokes. All four strips will overlap in the center. Lift edge of
bottom crust over ends of strips. Pinch together and flute edge. Place pie
on rimmed baking sheet.

7. Bake pie 50 to 55 minutes or until crust is lightly browned and filling
bubbles. Cool 10 minutes on wire rack before cutting.

      Title: Depression Era How To Roast A Duck
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    whole duck

A domestic duck requires almost twice cooking as wild duck. A wild duck
will take about 30 minutes in a hot oven and should always have strips of
bacon or salt pork laid across the breast while roasting, to keep it moist.
Both kinds of duck need thorough basting; wild ducks are not stuffed.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and
all.

      8 tb butter; 1/4 pound stick
    1/2 c  onion; finely chopped
      1    pigeon giblets; finely chop
  2 1/2 c  fireek; (coarsely crushed
      1    ; green wheat grains)
      2 ts mint, fresh; finely cut or
      1    ; 1 ts. dried mint, crumble

      1    ; or grouse
  1 1/2 c  water, cold
  2 1/2 c  chicken stock; fresh or can
      1    parsley sprigs

Name; Braised Pigeons with Crushed Wheat Stuffing

Over moderate heat melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy 10 to 12
inch skillet.  When the foam begins to subside, add the onions and the
pigeon giblets and, stirring frequently, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until
the onions are soft and light brown.  Add the fireek, mint, 1 teaspoon of
the salt and a few grindings of the pepper and stir for 2 or 3 minutes
until the grains are coated with butter. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees (F).
Pat the pigeons thoroughly dry inside and out with paper towels and
sprinkle their cavities with the remaining salt and a few grindings of
pepper.  Then stuff 5 tablespoons of the fireek mixture into the breast
cavity and 1 tablespoon into the neck cavity of each pigeon. Set the
remaining fireek aside.  Fasten the neck skin to the back of each bird with
a skewer and close the breast openings by lacing them with skewers or
sewing them with heavy white thread.  Truss the birds by tying their legs
together and bT 1: the skins with the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter.
Place the pigeons, breast side up, in a heavy 4 to 5 quart casserole and
pour in the water.  Bring to a boil on top of the stove, cover tightly and
braise in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes. Baste the pigeons with the
liquid in the casserole, and continue braising for 1 hour longer. To test
for doneness, pierce the thigh of a bird with the point of a small, sharp
knife.  If the juices that run out are slightly pink, cook for another 5 to
10 minutes.
A half hour or so before the pigeons are done, bring the chicken stock to
a boil in a 2 to 3 quart saucepan over high heat.  Stirring constantly, add
the reserved fireek mixture and bring to a boil again. Reduce the heat to
low, cover tightly, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the grains are
tender and have absorbed all the liquid.
To serve, arrange the pigeons on a heated platter and remove the trussing
strings and skewers.  Moisten the pigeons with the liquid remaining in the
casserole, and garnish the platter with parsley. Fluff the fireek with a
fork and serve it separately in a heated bowl.

           - 3 drop; s angostura bitter
      2 tb lea & perrins 
           -worcestershire, sauce
      1 tb liquid smoke

Instructions:

*DIRECTIONS*

Prepare the smoker as you would for any other roast.  Put the ingredients
listed above in the water pan.

To cook venison, it is important to remove the fat and membrane from the
meat.  I stick a knife in the meat, then push some peeled cloves of garlic
into the slit.  You can push whole fresh cayenne peppers and green onions
in the slit also.

After stuffing the slits you have made, sprinkle salt over the surface and
pat in.  Do the same with red cayenne pepper.

I would smoke the venison on the bottom rack and put a pork roast on the
top rack of the smoker.  That way it won't be so dry.

      Title: Beaver Information
 Categories: game, ethnic
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    information

From "Northern Cookbook" edited by Eleanor Ellis, Indian Affairs and
Northern Development, Ottawa 1973.

The industrious beaver is the largest rodent on the North American
Continent, and is found in all the waterways of the forested areas of the
north. Its rich brown fur has long been prized by trappers and hunters, and
the search for beaver pelts instigated much of the early exploration of the
continent. Because of its contribution to the development of our Dominion,
the beaver has been chosen as an emblem of Canada.
If the beaver pelt is to be prepared for market, care should be
taken in skinning the animal. Lay the beaver on its back in a clean place
and cut off the legs at the first joints. Then, with a sharp knife, slit
the pelt, starting at the lower lip. Insert the knife in this slit and,
with the sharp edge up, cut the pelt in a straight line down the belly to
the vent. Work out from this centre line cut and, with short strokes,,
separate the skin from the flesh. Carefully pull the legs through the skin,
leaving four round holes in the pelt. Cut off the tail where it meets the
fur. Skin carefully around the eyes and cut the ears close to the skull.
Finish removing the pelt, taking as little flesh and fat with it as
possible, then lay it on a flat surface, fur side down, and sponge off all
the blood marks with lukewarm water. Complete directions for stretching and
cleaning pelts are available from the Game Management Officers.
:       Beaver meat is dark red, fine grained, moist and tender, and when
properly prepared, is similar in flavour to roast pork. Cut the head from
the carcass and eviscerate the animal as follows: Make a cut through the
thin layer of meat from the breastbone to the vent, encircling the vent,
and being careful not to puncture the intestines. Lay the body cavity open,
and remove the viscera by grasping them above the stomach and pulling down
and out from the body cavity. Carefully cut out the tiny musk glands from
under the skin on the insides of the legs and be sure to remove the castor
gland under the belly near the tail. Trim off all the fat, then wash the
carcass thoroughly with warm water.

      Yield: 1 servings

      1    hare
      2    breasts of  pigeons
    2/3 c  dry white wine
    1/4 c  cognac
      4    juniper berries
      2    shallots
      1    oil for frying
    1/4 lb pork fat
      1 ts dried thyme
      1    egg
      1    fine sea salt
      1    black pepper
      1 lb thin slices of pork fat/
      1    unsmoked streaky bacon
      8 oz cooked ham, in 1 cubes
      1    unflvrd gelatine,
      1    gherkins & bay leaf

Remove all the meat from the hare and place it together with the skinned,
boned and lightly beaten pigeon breasts in a bowl. Add the wine, and Cognac

thin can be done easily by holding it down on a board, and running the back
of a carving knife across it. Spread the minced (ground) mixture on the
bottom of the terrine, then place strips of marinated hare, pigeon and ham
on top. Continue adding layers of the minced (ground) mixture and hare,
pigeon and cubes of ham. Make sure that the last layer is the minced
(ground) mixture. Cover with a layer of fat and the lid. Cook in a bain
marie (a roasting pan with 5 cm/2 inches of water will work just as well)
for 1 1/4-1 1/2 hours.

When cooked, the terrine will have shrunk from the sides of the dish.
Pierce the terrine with a skewer: if there is no trace of blood and the
juices run clear the terrine is done.

Remove the lid, place a weight on top and cool, preferably overnight,
before serving. Sometimes we pour off the juices, thicken them with a
little aspic powder or gelatine and pour them back over the terrine before
cooling. The flavour of the terrine improves if kept for 3-4 days before
serving.

Before serving, remove the top layer of fat and decorate with gherkins and
a bay leaf. Source: Wild Game Cooking, Rosendale Press Ltd

      Title: Tabasco Classic - Venison Chops Marchand De Muscadine
 Categories: game, peppers
      Yield: 4 servings

      8    venison chops, 4 ounces each
  1 1/4 ts tabasco pepper sauce
      1    salt
    1/4 lb butter or margarine, soften
      1 tb vegetable oil
    1/2 c  sliced green onions
      1 c  dry white wine
    1/2 c  muscadine jelly
    1/4 ts salt
      1    chopped fresh parsley

Avery Island and the country around it abound in game, especially wild
ducks and geese, snipe, woodcock, doves and deer.  We age our venison for
at least four weeks and cook it rare.  We use muscadine jelly from Callaway
Gardens for our sauce, but you can use any flavorful fruit jelly, such as
grape or guava.

Season the chops with 1 teaspoon of the Tabasco sauce and sprinkle them
with salt.  In a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and the oil
over medium-high heat.  In two batches, cook the chops for 5 minutes,
turning once, and remove to a warm platter.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the same skillet.  Add the green onions
and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, or until tender. Stir in the
wine.  Bring to a boil and boil rapidly to reduce to 1/2 cup.

Stir in the jelly until it is melted.  Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon
Tabasco sauce and salt to taste.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the
remaining 5 tablespoons butter, a tablespoon at a time, until the sauce is
slightly thickened.

Serve over the chops.  Sprinkle with parsley.

      Title: Roasted Duck (Kathy Pitts)
 Categories: game
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    no ingredients

Rinse the duck inside and out. Trim off the first joint of the wing, and
pull off all visible fat from both the neck cavity and body cavity of the
bird.  Rub the inside of the duck with a cut lemon.  If you like, stick a
couple of pieces of celery and a cut orange inside the body cavity of the
duck (it gives a nice flavor).

Truss the duck for roasting.  Now comes the fun part:  with an icepick or
carving fork, stab the H**l out of the duck, particularly on the lower
portion of the breast, and along the thighs.  Rub the duck skin with a cut
lemon.

Place the duck on a rack in a fairly deep roasting pan (you'll need it to
catch the fat).  Preheat your oven to 450 degrees.  Place the duck in the
oven, and roast for exactly 15 minutes.  Pull the duck out, and stab it
again.  Reduce the oven heat to 350, and return the duck to the oven. Roast
until the duck reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees, continuing
to prick the skin of the duck maybe every 20 minutes. DO NOT BASTE. As the
fat from the duck accumulates in the bottom of the pan, drain it out, to
prevent it from coming over the top of the roasting rack and touching the
duck. This entire process will take about an hour and a half.

      Title: Wilderness Fried Rabbit With Pan Gravy
 Categories: game, misc.
      Yield: 4 servings

      1 ea fryer rabbit
    1/4 c  margarine or butter
      4 tb oil
      1    milk for dipping
      1    flour to coat
      1    salt and pepper
      2 tb flour
    1/2 ts salt
    1/8 ts black pepper
      1 c  milk
      1 c  water
      1    paprika for garnish
      1    parsley flakes for garnish

Divide the rabbit into serving pieces, disjointing whenever possible. Dip
each portion into milk.  Salt and pepper, then roll lightly in flour.

Put 1/4 cup margarine and 4 T oil in heavy fry pan over high heat. Put in
the pieces, any bony sides uppermost. Lower the temperature at once and
cook, uncovered, until the portions are brown on one side. Then turn just
once and brown the other side.

The meat will be crisp and done in slightly more than half an hour. Spread
it out on absorbent paper and keep it warm while making the gravy.

Pour out all the fat except enough to just cover the bottom of the fry pan.

Stir in 2 T flour, 1/2 ts salt, 1/8 ts freshly ground black pepper,
smoothing these into a paste. Using the milk in which you immersed the
meat, add additional milk to make a cupful.  Pour this, then a cup of
water, slowly into the pan, all the time stirring.

Simmer over low heat for 12 minutes, adding more milk and water if the
gravy becomes too thick. Finally, sprinkle with paprika and parsley flakes.

      1    onion; chopped
      1 md carrot; sliced thin
      6    black peppercorns

      1 ts caraway seeds (opt'l)
      1    salt
      1    fresh ground black pepper
      1 lb potatoes
  1 1/4 c  plain yoghurt or sour cream

In a shallow dish, combine all the marinade ingredients and add the cubed
caribou. Cover and leave in a cool place for 24 hours. Remove the meat
cubes from the marinade. Pat dry and roll in a little flour. Strain the
marinade and reserve.

Cut the peppers in half and remove seeds. Chop the peppers into cubes. Chop
the onion and mince the garlic. Cut the celery into 1/2 inch slices. Heat
the oil in a large frying pan, and brown the caribou quickly. Remove it,
then add the chopped vegetables to the oil and saute quickly; but do not
allow to brown.

Put the caribou and fried vegetables into a flameproof casserole. Add the
tomatoes, roughly chopped, and the tomato paste.

Sprinkle the paprika, caraway seeds, and salt and pepper to taste on to the
contents of the casserole, and pour in the marinade liquid. Stir well and
bring almost to boiling. Cover. Turn down the heat and simmer gently on top
of the stove for 1 1/2-2 hours.

25 minutes before the goulash is ready, add the potatoes, peeled and cubed.

Just before serving, add the yoghurt/sour cream and stir. Taste for
seasoning: more paprika or caraway may be added if liked.

      Yield: 1 batch

     15 lb caribou
      5 lb pork; fresh
      3 oz water
      1 oz pepper; black
    3/4 oz ginger; ground
  1 1/4 oz nutmeg; ground
    1/2 oz allspice; ground
    1/2 oz coriander; ground
      2 oz paprika

      1    sausage casings

Grind together the two meats and mix thoroughly. Add the water. Mix the
spices thoroughly and mix well into meat mixture. If sausage is to be
smoked, omit the liquid smoke.

You may stuff sausage into casings, making 6-8" links and smoke them.

OR make into patties for freezing.

Or boil them: Using a sausage stuffer, fill casings about 3/4 full to allow
for swelling. Tie the ends with string; put into a large kettle of cold
water and bring to a boil. Cook for about 1 hour, being sure to prick each
sausage with a fork after boiling 10 minutes. Drain and cool.

They can also be canned after boiling.

      Title: Braised Rattlesnake
 Categories: game
      Yield: 1 recipe

      1    no ingredients

The delicacies of ratlesnake meat was introduced to us at an early age by
my father, the youngest son of John Bowen, the Founder of Pleasanton, Tx.
As a cowboy on the old Judge Noonan Circle Dot ranch, with his 44 Colt
six-shooter now in the Ben Parker Atascosa Museum, he'd blast the head off
a sizeable diamond back and supper was practically in the pot.

Cut 5" sections of the dressed rattler till you have about 2 pounds. Salt
and peppepr; dip pin milk and roll in flour.  In 2 or 3 T. of hot fat
sizzle in a heavy skillet till golden brown on both sides.

With slices of onion on top of the meat, add a scant cup or so of hot
water, cover tight and simmer.  Don't boil.  Very slowly on low heat for
about an hour until it's tender as your heart.  A sprinkle or two of milk
for the last fifteen minutes is all to the good.  Add a little garlic and,
if you want your spurs to really jingle, throw in, as your conscience
dictates, a grab of chili-petines.

It's larrupin' good all right; but if you're feeding a dude tell him it's
flown-in breast sections of baby French pheasants or hind legs of a new
breed of frogs and he'll CHUPAR LOS DEDOS!!

      Title: Rattlesnake Barbecue Sauce
 Categories: game
      Yield: 3 servings

      1 c  chili sauce
      1 c  ketchup
    1/4 c  a-1 steak sauce
      1 tb tamarindo (or substitute 
           -grenadine)
      1 tb garlic juice (from strained 
           -pureed; garlic)
    1/4 c  fresh horseradish -- finely 
           -grated
      3 tb dry mustard
      2 tb tabasco sauce
      1 tb molasses
      1 tb prepared hot salsa
      1 tb red wine vinegar

In a medium bowl combine all ingredients. Whisk them until smooth. Adjust
the Tabasco sauce to taste. Refrigerate the sauce until it is ready to use
or up to 2 weeks. Makes 3 cups.

Note: When grated, horseradish's flavor dissapates quickly into the air, so
use it immediately. Select a light molasses from the first distillation.
Unless you love harsh flavors, avoid blackstrap molasses, which is from the
third and last distillation and thus contains the most impuritites.

      Title: Pigeon Or Squab Pie
 Categories: pies, poultry, game
      Yield: 1 pie

      6    pigeons or squabs (about 5 
           -pounds d; rawn weight)
      6    livers from birds
    1/2 ts salt
    1/4 ts pepper
      2 ts parsley
      1    butter or margarine
      1 lb sirloin or round steak cut 
           -paper th; in
    1/2 lb mushrooms, chopped
      1 c  chopped parsley
      4    hard-cooked egg yolks
  1 1/2 c  brown gravy (13.4 oz can)
      1    ******puff pastry*******
      1 c  butter
      2 c  sifted cake flour
    1/4    to 1/2 cup ice water

Rinse the birds in cold water, drain and pat dry.  Chop the livers and mix
with salt, pepper, and parsley.  Place some of the liver mixture and a dot
of butter in each bird.  Truss the birds.  Line the bottom of a 14- x 9- x
2-inch baking dish with the beef, then with a layer of mushrooms and
parsley.  Set the birds on this, separating each from the other with
hard-cooked egg yolks.  Pour the brown gravy over the birds. Cover the top
of the baking dish with puff pastry, being sure to secure edges. Make
gashes or a design down the center of the pastry. Bake in a 450*F. oven
8-10 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown, and the birds are cooked.
Makes 6 servings.

PUFF PASTRY********

Allow half of butter to soften.  Cut remaining butter into flour with 2
knives scissors-fashion or with pastry blender until all the tiny particles
of fat are coated with flour.  Add ice water a little at a time, toss with
fork, use only enough water to hold ingredients together.

On lightly floured board roll out dough 1/4-inch thick and square shaped.
Spread two thirds of dough with a quarter of the softened butter; fold
unbuttered third over center third and fold remaining buttered third over
to cover first third, buttered side down.  (You should have 3 layers of
dough with butter between each layer.)  Roll the dough to about 1/4-inch
thickness and make it square again. Spread with another quarter of the
butter.  Fold as before; chill thoroughly (about 1 hour each time). Roll,
spread with butter, fold and chill 2 more times. Roll into rectangle large
enough to fit top of casserole. Bake in 450*F. oven 8-10 minutes, then
reduce heat heat to 350*F. and bake as directed in Pigeon Pie or longer
until golden and puffed.

 Categories: game
      Yield: 4 servings

      4    elk steak; 1 thick
      3    garlic clove; or to taste

      1    salt & pepper; to taste

---------------------------GREEN PEPPERCORN SAUCE---------------------------
      4 tb butter, unsalted
    1/4 c  whole green peppercorns
      1    salt & pepper; to taste
      1 tb cognac

Wash the steaks and pat dry. Carefully trim away all visible fat.

Combine the garlic and olive oil. Pour over steaks and marinate,
refrigerated, for two to four hours. Season the steaks with salt and
freshly ground pepper. Broil five to seven minutes per side or until meat
has only a hint of pink. Serve with GREEN PEPPERCORN SAUCE.

GREEN PEPPERCORN SAUCE: In a small saucepan, melt the butter and stir in
the remaining ingredients. Heat to boiling, stirring occasionally.

be substituted for elk. When serving Venison or Red Stag Steaks, PORT WINE
SAUCE is better than the green peppercorn sauce.

simply wrap it in opound packages in aluminum foil and freeze it for safe
keeping.  To use it ssimply make upp into patties and fry like hamburger or
hamburger steak.  It is delicious.

To make up into ssausages you can do it in ttwo different ways, depending
on where you have smoking equipment or ot.  Either method is equally good.

1. If you do not have smoking equipment proceed as follows.

Mix in 3 level ts. of liquid smoke (Check the instructions on the liquid
smoke bottle as the amount necessary to use varies from brand to brand.
Herter's French-Canadian Liquid Smoke is best.)

Stuff the meat in casings if you have them.  Keep the links about 6-8
inches long.  If you have no casings, simply make the meat iinto patties.
This workds just as well.

Smoking is just a baking process.  Put what you will use for 2 weeks in
your refrigerator.  Wrap the balance iin aluminum foil and freeze.

2.  If you have smoking equiipment proceed as follows.

Stuff the meaat in casing if you have them.  Keep the links about 6-8
inches long.  Keep the links connected until they are dry.  If you do not
have casings, make up the meat into patties and place them on metal trays
or wiire screen that will go in your smokehousse or smoker. Smoke over a
low maple, apple, messquiite or hickory wood fire from 4-6 hours. Keep the
fire low at about 120 degrees.  This is not hot enough to cause much
dripping or shrinking.

Remove and put a two week's supply in your refrigerator.  Wrap the balance
in aluminum foil and freeze at once.

To cook, put the patties or sausages in a frying pan and add enough water
to cover up 1/3 of the way on them.  Put a cover on the fryingpan and boil
for 15 minutes.  Remove, pourout the water from the frying pan and then put
the patties or sausages back into the frying pan and brown them slightly on
all sides.  Makes wonderful eating.

      Title: Roast Goose With Potato Stuffing
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 8 servings

    1/4 c  soft goose or chicken fat
      2 ts paprika
  2 1/2 ts salt
     12 md (3 lbs) potatoes
    1/2 ts ground black pepper
      1 c  chopped onion
    1/3 c  chopped parsley
      4 lg eggs, beaten
  1 1/3 c  matzo meal
    1/4 c  hot goose or chicken fat
    2/3 c  diced celery
      1    8-10 lb. ready-to-cook goose

Note: "Because Elizabeth I of England and her court were eating roast goose
on Michaelmas Day, September 29, 1588, when news arrived of the defeat of
the Spanish Armada, the Queen decreed that roast goose should be served
each Michaelmas Day to commemorate the victory. This recipe is of Jewish
origin, with a very good stuffing.

Mix the 1/4 c. chicken or goose fath the paprika and 2 ts. salt and rub a
portion of it inside crop and body cavities of goose.  Grate potatoes and
mix remaining salt and next 7 ingredients.  Spoon into the crop and body
cavities.  Close the openings with skewers and lace tightly wtih a string.
Rub remaining fat and paprika mixture over the outside skin of goose.

Place on a rack, breast-side down, in a roasting pan.  Cook in a preheated
slow oven (325 F) 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  When goose is 2/3 done, according to
cooking time, turn breast up to finish cooking. To test for doneness, move
drumstick up and down.  The joint should yield readily or twist out and the
meat should feel very soft.

Siphon off fat with a poultry baster as it accumulates in roasing pan. Made
gravy from pan drippings, using 1 1/2 T. flour to each cup water or stock.
Add salt and pepper to taste.

      Title: Mohawk Marinated Bear Steak
 Categories: game, asian
      Yield: 1 recipe

      4    bear steaks, 1 1/2 thick
      2    wild onions, sliced
      1 c  indian vinegar
      1 c  water
    1/2 c  maple syrup
      2 tb spice bush powder
      1 tb salt
      1 tb bear fat, rendered
      1    salt and pepper

Get a bear just before hibernation, as they are usually fat and rich at
this time.  All fat should be trimmed off the meat, which is very easy as
bear meat is not marbled like beef.  Marinating the meat makes it taste
better and makes the meat tender and juicy.

In a large pottery bowl mix the onions, Indian vinegar, wataer, maple
syrup, spice bush powder and salt.  Let stand for a couple of hours, then
put in the bear steaks.  Put in a cool place for about 24 hours, turning
the steaks every once in a while.

Remove the steaks from the marinade, let them drain and pat them dry. Heat
a heavy frying pan and rub the pan with the rendered bear fat. Place the
steaks in the pan and sear on both sides.  Lower the heat and finish
cooking, adding more fat to prevent sticking.  Remove steaks from the
frying pan.  Add a little flour and water to thicken the gravy. Pour gravy
over the individual steaks on the serving dish. Serve with potatoes.

is about like cake batter. Heat the bear fat or lard in a deep fryer to
about 360 degrees. Dip the pieces of skunk in the batter and then fry them
in the deep fryer until golden brown. Drain well and serve.

      Title: Pigeon With Cherries
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 1 servings

      2    good plump pigeons
      1 oz drippings or bacon fat
      2    sliced shallots or spring
      1    onions
      1 oz flour
      1    bouquet garni (mixed herbs)
    1/2 lb red cherries stoned
    1/2 oz butter
      1    cream
  1 1/2 pt stock

Brown the pigeons slowly but throughly in the dripping in the casserole.
Lift them out and in the same fat brown the sliced shallots. While the
onions are browning split the pigeons in half and trim the backbone with
the sissors. sprinkle the flour in the pan and brown lightly. Add the
stock, bring to the boil and add the pigeons with the bouguet garni. Cook
in the casserole in a slow to moderate oven for about 1 1/2 hours. then
remove the pigeons carefully and keep warm. Reduce the sauce by boiling
quickly until it is of a syrupy consistancy. Strain the sauce and replace
it in the pigeons to reheat throughly. Add cream to taste. Sauter the
stoned cherries quickly in the butter. Dish the pigeons. Pour over the

NB. The European wood pigeon is _Columba palumbus_ and is a large bird of
length 16-18 inches long and live weight of about 1lb. One pigeon can *just
about* feed two people but one pigeon per person is a good meal but not too
much.

"Tartes of Flesh"  from _The Forme of Cury_, 1378

Mix together the pork, eggs, cheese, sugar, and seasonings. Line a 9"
pie-dish with half of the pastry. Spread the mixture.
Brown the pieces of fowl in butter and lay them on top. Pour in the
stock. Cover with a pastry lid and bake at 375f for 35 to 40 minutes.

QUESTION: does "conynges"=rabbit? The original: " Take pork sodden and
grind it small, take eggs boiled hard and put thereto with cheese ground,
take good powder and whole spice sugar, safron, and salt and do thereto
make a coffin as to hold the same and do this therein and poant it with the
small birds and conyngs (rabbits?) and hew them in small pieces and bake it
as tofore and serve it forth."

      Title: Pot Roast Geese
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    goose
      1    some onions and garlic
      1    salt, pepper
      1    worcestershire sauce
      1    oil
      1    chopped onions, garlic,
      1    celery

Finely chop up some onions and garlic. About as small as you can. Season it
with salt, pepper and whistacher (how do you spell that!) sauce. Make slits
in the front of the goose breast next to the wishbone down the length of
the breast. Stuff the onions and garlic mixture into the slits.

Place enough oil in the pot you plan to pot roast the goose so that the oil
is about 1/4&; deep. Bring the oil to heat then place the goose in the oil
and sear it all around. This will help keep the moisture in the goose.

Once the goose is seared remove from the oil and then add coarsely chopped
onions, garlic, celery (and anything else you would like in the gravy) to
the oil. Saute the vegetables for a while. Once the onions start to soften
and turn clean, replace the goose and add water. Once the water starts to
boil, reduce heat to low and cover.

Every 20 minutes or so, check on the goose. Add water often and baste the
goose every time. Also turn goose every other basting.

Slow wet heat is very important to how this dish will turn out. Do not add
too much water at first and DO NOT LET WATER BOIL OUT. Keep adding a little
water every so often.

How long will it take to cook. A long time (3 hours or more)! The goose
will be done when you can stick a fork into the breast and flake the meat
out.

Well worth the cooking time (IMO)!!!

      Title: Baked Duck Breasts And Rice In Roast Duck Stock
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 1 servings

      3    ducks
      1    onions
      1    head of garlic
      1    carrots
      1    seasoning mix:
      5    parts salt.
      1    part onion powder
      1    part garlic powder
      1    part white pepper
    1/4    part cayenne pepper
      1    part cumin
      1    part thyme
      1    part rubbed sage

First day (usually a Friday night)

Get out a roasting pan and start your oven preheating to 325 degrees. Take
2 or 3 plucked mallards and with a sharp boning or filet knife, remove the
breasts. Trim away excess skin and fat but make sure skin remains across at
least 50% of each breast.  I like a large band of skin that runs long ways
but only about an inch thick.  Wrap each breast with plastic wrap and
refrigerate.

Next, make a seasoning mix.

The following seasoning mix is made with parts instead of a specific
measurement.  You can substitute the word cup, or all the way down to
teaspoon, in place of the word parts.  For a dinner for four people,
substitute table spoon for the word parts.  You may have some left over but
it will keep.

Rub the remainder of the ducks down (not the duck breasts; which should be
in your refrig), inside and out, with the seasoning.  Put in a large
roasting pan and place in your preheated oven.  Roast ducks until the legs
pull away easily (once the skin has been broken) from the body. This could
take anywhere from 1 to 4 hours depending on your oven temp; the amount of
ducks; and the size.  I first check at 1 hour and then every half hour
afterwards.

Once the ducks have roasted, let them cool in the roasting pan.  Once cool,
remove the ducks onto a large cutting board or other large surface. Take
the fat drippings from the roasting pan and pour into a large sealable
container  (a mason jar will work well).  Now pull the meat from the duck
and place into a bowl.  Place the remaining carcasses and skin into a large
stock pot.  Cover the bones, plus about three inches above, with water.
Quarter up an onion or two and cut in half a bulb (8 to 10 cloves) of
garlic.  Put into to stock pot (germ{outer skin} and all). Brake up a few
carrots an put them in too. Now bring the stock pot to a slow boil over
medium heat and reduce to low heat. Make sure the heat is on *low* a tiny
bubble or two should rise to the top every second or so but do not get this
too hot. Let this cook overnight. The next morning, run the stock through a
strainer and place into a container (1 gallon pitcher will work nicely) and
refrigerate.

I'll make the assumption that you are feeding 4 people and have 2 or 3
mallard ducks (if you have small ducks you may need 4)

The night of the meal (usually a Saturday for me),  start by preheating
your oven to 350 degrees. Chop your pulled duck meat (not the breasts) into
very fine pieces. Now, take a large skillet and add about 3 or 4 tbl of the
reserved duck fat (it should look like crisco shortening after the
refrigeration process).  Heat it to medium high heat. Chop up some onion
(about a cup) and saute in the duck fat. At this point, I reduce the heat
to medium low and add about 3/4 cup of chicken livers (this part could be
eliminated if you don't like chicken liver; duck liver is fine for domestic
ducks - I am not going to recommend wild duck liver to you since I can't
personally inspect it). Break these up real fine and sprinkle cayenne
pepper over them (use to your heat tolerance level). At this point, add two
cups of rice (I personally use Texmati or Basmati). Coat the rice well with
the duck fat.  Add 4 cups of stock to the mixture and simmer for a couple
minutes (3 to 5).  Pour into a baking dish and add the chopped duck meat.
Mix together well.  Cover baking dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes.

      Title: Quail With Crawfish Dressing
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    braces of quail
      3 c  stock of crawfish
      1    shells/heads, onion, garlic,
      1    carrots and water.
      1    pan of cornbread
      1 c  onion
  1 1/2 c  red bell pepper
      1 c  celery
      1    clove garlic
      1    stick of butter
      1 lb crawfish tail meat
      1    spice mixtures:
      1 ts white pepper
      1 ts basil
      1 ts thyme
      1 ts red pepper (cayenne)
      1 ts salt
      2    bay leaves

Okay, here's one of my favorite quail recipes:

You'll need a brace of quail per person.  Pluck and draw the birds; don't
even think about skinning them.

Crawfish Dressing:

You'll need about three or four cups of stock.  I make my stock from
scratch using crawfish shells/heads, onion, garlic, carrots and water. Use
about six cups of water to make 3 cups of stock. Bring ingredients to a
boil and simmer until reduced to 3 to 4 cups. NOTE: you can use can chicken
or duck stock if you can't find whole crawfish (many places will sell you
the cleaned tails in a vacuumed packed packages). Also, heaven forbid, you
could use a canned chicken broth if you don't want to make a stock.

You'll need to run this mixture through a strainer to finish the stock. It
probably wouldn't taste to good with a mess of crawfish shells in it ;-)

To make the dressing you will need cornbread.  So bake it or buy it. I
can't really tell you how much exactly.  I use as much as it takes to
absorb the liquids. I make a 9 inch cast-iron skillet's worth. I also use
white cornbread but it doesn't really matter that much.

Now that you have your stock and cornbread here is how you make it.

Chop the following: onion bell pepper (I use red ones) celery garlic Make
the spice mixture. Melt a stick of butter in a large skillet. saute veggies
in butter until tender. add spice mixture to veggies add the three cups of
stock and simmer a few minutes longer.

Add crawfish (between a half to a full pound of tail meat). Simmer about
five minutes.

with a slotted spoon, remove all veggies and crawfish and place into a food
processor or blender.  lightly process (I usually don't over do it here. I
like to have small bits of crawfish in the dressing).

Return processed mixture to the stock. Use crumbled cornbread to absorb the
liquid.

Stuff the quail with the dressing and baste with butter.  Roast birds at
325 degrees, basting as often as needed. Roast time is dependent upon
number of birds. Once the skin turns a light golden brown, check by trying
to separate one of the tiny little legs from the quail. If it pulls from
the side easily it's done. Explaining when a roasted bird is done is hard
for me to do. It's just something you gotta know.

Serve this with the remainder of the crawfish stuffing and a what ever
veggies you desire.

One other note of importance:  Crawfish are not in season during the start
of quail season so use this recipe later in the season.  It's a cold
weather dish anyhow.  One other thing, do *not* substitute shrimp for
crawfish; they're completely different tasting crustaceans.

      Title: Crockpot Goose Or Duck With Apples
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    text file

another one that i just made up one day, so please accept the vagueness
works with whole ducks, part ducks, whole geese, or part geese...

measure out about two cups of good red wine... drink one...

pour the other cup into a slow cooker of pressure cooker on *LOW*...

get three-ten apples, eat one or two and dice the rest... probably core
them, but peeling is optional...

place the apples in the wine and then dump in your meat...

if the ducks/geese are whole, you might consider putting most of the apples
inside them (assuming you believe in gutting your fowl and not cooking guts
together with the bird...if you do, i take no responsibility for this
recipe...legally, morally, or gastronomically)

if the meat and apples aren't mostly covered, pour enough wine into the
mixture to bring them up to about 3/4 covered...if you just happen to not
have much wine left in the bottle, finish it yourself, because a good red
wine shouldn't sit around very long, nor should you have to share it since
you are going to all this trouble doing the cooking...

cover and simmer until the meat is almost falling off the bones (if you
took the bones out, i'll leave it to you to define tender)...

this is one of those things you can do in the morning and have ready when
you come back from work, and also have the advantage of having all the
people in the house go nuts smelling the good cooking smells...

serve the meat...and make sauce from the apples...leftover wine/apple juice
can be used as a au jus for serving the meat...

best applesauce you'll ever eat...

and if you do this before you go to work, the wine should help start your
day pretty well too...

btw...i'm originally from michigan, so we know that there is one kind of
apple you should never use for eating or cooking use...those "delicious"
apples deported from washington...we tried not to grow them, but used
decent apples instead...realizing that the only thing good about the
"delicious"; was that it shipped...hence we knew that the people from
washington state were deporting them to the rest of the country, and making
big advertising noises about their wonderful qualities, all the time
keeping the few good apples they grew to themselves...

now...if i can't start a flame war of some sort with this post, we all must
be too busy hunting to care....

      Title: Goose In Orange Sauce
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 6 servings

      1 lg canada goose
      1 pk oven cooking bags
      2    envelopes brown gravy mix
      4 tb brown sugar
      2    6 oz. cans frozen orange
      1    juice concentrate,
      1    pulp-free
      2 c  hot water
    1/2 c  flour
      4 tb orange marmalade or plum
      1    jelly
      3    cloves garlic, finely
      1    chopped

Slowly thaw the bird (overnight in the refrigerator) and clean thoroughly.
Place goose breast down in oven-cooking bag, seal and bake in a covered
roasting pan for approximately 1 to 1-1/2 hours in a 325 degree oven. Pour
fat and drippings from goose and discard. Mix above ingredients together,
pour over goose and into cooking bag, and seal bag. Return to roasting pan
and continue cooking 2-4 more hours, or until goose is falling off bones or
appears to be tender. Pour sauce into gravy boat and serve with sliced
goose.

ADDENDUM

Cleaning

I found it very important that the bird be thawed and cooked immediately
afterward. Waiting 1 or 2 days to cook it after thawing tends to taint the
meat and it does not taste very good. Also, it is very important to clean
the bird thoroughly before cooking. I run the bird under cold water while
picking off all excess fat and feathers and then run cold water through the
body cavity until the water is clear.

Cooking

I found the maximum roasting times were the best, regardless of the size of
the goose. That is, roast it 1-1/2 hours and then 4 hours.

[This sounds like too long to me, but I have never used cooking bags
before. I would watch the bird very carefully after about the third hour.-
JW]

Cooking bags

Cooking bags are available from Safeway in the food wrap section. Get the
large size. The package contains 2 bags. Do not try to save the first
cooking bag. Instead of "pouring fat and drippings from goose" just remove
the goose from the cooking bag, discard the bag (drippings and all), put
goose into a new bag, pour sauce into bag, and seal.

Serving

When done, the meat will be falling off the bones. Remove skin and discard.
Remove meat from bones and arrange pieces on a serving platter. Discard
bones. Pour orange sauce over the meat pieces and serve.

      Title: Roast Goose With Garlic, Onion And Sage Stuffing
 Categories: poultry, game, stuffing
      Yield: 6 servings

      1    stuffing:
    1/4 c  unsalted butter
      2 sm onions, finely chopped
      2    celery stalks, diced
      5    garlic cloves, chopped
     14 oz bag cubed herbed stuffing
      1    mix
  1 1/2 tb rubbed or ground dried sage
    3/4 ts salt
    1/2 ts dried oregano, crumbled
    1/2 ts dried thyme, crumbled
    1/2 ts pepper
    1/2 ts italian seasoning
      2    eggs, beaten to blend
      1 c  chicken stock or canned
      1    broth
      1    goose:
     12 lb goose, fat removed from
      1    cavity
      1    lemon, halved
      3    bacon slices

For stuffing: Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add
onions, celery and garlic and saute until soft, about 8 minutes. Combine
stuffing mixture, sage, salt, oregano, thyme, pepper and Italian Seasoning
in large bowl. Stir in onion mixture and eggs. Add stock and mix well. Set
aside.

[This sounds like a lot of seasoning for the stuffing. I would probably use
plain dried bread cubes rather than a commercial pre-seasoned product.- JW]

For goose: Preheat oven to 450 deg. F. Rinse goose inside and out; pat dry,
using paper towel. Rub goose inside and out with halved lemon. Season goose
inside and out with salt and pepper. Fill main cavity and neck cavity
loosely with stuffing. Place any remaining stuffing in small buttered
baking dish and cover with foil. Run fingers between breast meat and skin
to loosen skin. Place bacon slices under breast skin. Wrap goose in
cheesecloth.

Place goose on rack set into large roasting pan. Roast goose 30 minutes.
Reduce heat to 350 deg. F. Continue roasting until meat thermometer
inserted into thickest part to thigh registers 180 deg. F., basting every
20 minutes with pan juices, about 1 hour 20 minutes.

[At 15 minutes per pound, a 12 pound goose would take about 3 hours not an
hour and twenty minutes.- JW]

(Place stuffing in covered baking dish in oven during last 40 minutes.)
Remove cheesecloth. Transfer goose to platter. Pass stuffing separately.

I got this one from an old bird bagger named Preston Mann. This will work
with ringnecks, quail or chukar and is a can't wreck the meal recipe.

Use Pillsbury Crescent Roll dough to wrap breast meat from any of the above
listed game birds. Toss in anything you may think tasty - raisins, apple,
onion garlic, celery, orange- use your imagination. Seal the meat and
goodies in the dough by pinching. Into the oven at 350 for 10-15 minutes,
when the dough is brown the bird is done.

Skin the birds then clean and dry them inside and out.  Prepare your

raisins is our favorite.  Lay 2 or 3 strips of bacon across the breast and
wrap the bird loosely but airtight in aluminum foil. Place in a roasting
pan uncovered and bake for 60 - 80 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven.
Open the foil to see if the fat from the bacon has cooked down into the
breast as it should.  If it has, open the foil wide and allow to bake
uncovered for another 15 to 20 minutes to brown.

      Title: Roast Teal
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 4 servings

      4    teal
      2    apples, peeled, cored and
      1    halved
      8    strips of bacon
    1/2 c  port wine
      1 tb lemon juice
      1 c  plum or red currant jelly
      2 ts flour
      1    salt and pepper to taste

Salt and pepper the birds inside and out, and place half an apple in each
bird.  Truss the bird so as to bind down the 2 slices of bacon that you
wrap around each teal.  Place in a roasting pan. In a small skillet heat
the wine and lemon juice, then stir in and dissolve the jelly. Ladle it
over the birds and roast at 400 degrees for 20 - 25 minutes depending on
how rare you like your duck. Remove the ducks to a platter and make the
sauce by skimming off the bacon fat, then stirring in over a low flame the
flour and two tablespoons of water. Simmer until the sauce is thick, pour
it over the birds and serve.

      Title: Mexicali Pheasant
 Categories: poultry, game
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    text file

Here is our lunch recipe when hunting in the Mexicali Valley.  We skin the
bird and cut it in to quarters.  Double a large piece of heavy duty foil.
To the pheasant add sliced onion, butter, Cavenders Greek Spice and garlic
powder.  Seal the mixture in foil.  We make our fire by putting eight or
ten one inch sticks like the radius of a bike tire. Put the foil in the
middle of the fire, pushing in the sticks as they burn down. It takes about
twenty minutes to cook and we eat it with tortillas cooked over the same
fire. We are usually able to take a few doves while waiting for lunch.

      2 ea snowshoe rabbits; cut into 
           -serving pieces
      8 tb flour
      6 tb to 8 tb bacon fat or lard
      1    salt & pepper
    1/2 ts thyme
    1/2 ts basil
      2 cl garlic
      1 c  or more white wine or dry

           -mushroom ca; tsup
    1/2 lb mushrooms; sliced
      2 tb butter
      1 tb flour (optional)

Roll serving pieces in flour or shake in paper bag and saute in fat or
lard in skillet or electric skillet, turning often, until browned (about 15
minutes on medium heat).

Add remaining ingredients, save the mushrooms and butter, cover, and
simmer for 1-1-1/2 hours.

After an hour saute the mushrooms in the butter for 5 minutes, then add
them to the skillet.

Timing instructions cannot be exact, so you must test the biggest pieces
of hare from time to time.

If sauce thickens too much, add more white wine; if after, say, 1-1/2
hours it is not thick enough, make a paste of one tablespoon flour and
liquid and stir into sauce. _The L.L. Bean Game & Fish Cookbook_. Angus

      Yield: 10 servings

     10 lb hare (winter phase)
      1    vinegar
      1    salt & pepper
      1    flour
      4 tb lard or oil

      2 c  pineapple
      1 ea apple
      1 ea orange; unpeeled
      1    sugar

* the northern hare of the Alaska peninsula (Lepus timidus) are big animals
(7 to 10 pounds plus), but do not usually weigh as much as the Arctic hare
(Lepus arcticus) of Greenland, Ellesmere, and the Northern Baffin Islands.
The latter may weigh up to 15 pounds. Our Lepus timidus is the same species
as the blue hare of the Scottish Highlands and Scandinavia.

This recipe would produce a fine dish if 2 snowshoe rabbits were
substituted for the Northern hare.

Cut hare into 1/2-pound serving pieces. Soak 24 hours in lightly
vinegared water. Wipe dry. Salt and pepper the pieces, roll them in flour
and brown in fat or oil in a Dutch oven, then bake at 350 F degrees,
covered, until tender.

Add vegetables when meat is half done (perhaps after 45 minutes to an
hour). Remove to platter and prepare gravy from drippings.

To make sauce, grind cranberries, pineapple, apple, and orange together.
Sweeten to taste. Serve on the side.

      Title: Chicken-Fried Rabbit With Cream Gravy - Llbgfc
 Categories: main dish, game
      Yield: 4 servings

      2 ea cottontail rabbits; cut into
           - serving pieces
      4 tb flour
      1    salt & freshly ground pepper
      5 tb lard; for starters
      2 tb flour
    3/4 c  milk
    1/2 c  heavy cream

Shake the rabbit in a paper bag with the flour, salt, and pepper. Pick a
heavy skillet (which some lid will fit) that, crowded, will just hold the
rabbit pieces. Melt the lard in it until hot, then turn heat to medium,
crowd in the rabbit pieces, and for the next 10 to 20 minutes stand over
the skillet, turning and adjusting the pieces until all sides are golden
brown.

As you brown the pieces, their floured surfaces may absorb enough fat to
require more lard; add as needed.

Now, turn heat to low, cover the skillet, and simmer for 12 minutes or
so. Turn the pieces, if need be, during this process.

Turn heat to medium or medium high, remove lid, and turning the pieces
when needed, evaporate the moisture for another 10 minutes or so.

Remove rabbit to a hot platter, pour off all but 3 tablespoon or so of
fat, stir the flour into the fat and "greables" (or dredgings) and cook
over low heat for 2 minutes or so.

Off heat, stir in the milk, then back on low heat cook until it starts
to thicken. Stir in the cream and continue to heat but do not boil.

For a variation, stir in with the cream 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard and
1/4 cup of grated Parmesan.

      Title: Civet De Lapin (Rabbit Stew With Red Wine) Part 2
 Categories: poultry, game, ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings

      1 ea recipe directions pt.2

TO SERVE:

Transfer the rabbit, onions, lardons and mushrooms to a large serving
platter with a slotted spoon. Dip one end of each crouton into the sauce
and then into the chopped parsley and arrange around the edge of the
platter. Spoon the sauce over the rabbit and vegetables. Serve with the
boiled potatoes.

CUTTING A RABBIT INTO SERVING PIECES

With a large, heavy knife trim the ends of the front and hind legs. Cut off
the front and hind legs at the joints. Cut the hind legs into 2 pieces at
the joint and the body into 3 equal sections. Cut the rib section in half
through the breast and back bones and then cut each half in half.

POMMES DE TERRE A L'ANGLAISE (ENGLISH BOILED POTATOES):

Serves 6.

In France, anything that is simply boiled is said to be a l'anglaise,
English-style. Unlike their English counterparts, however, French chefs
typically "turn" their vegetables (cut them into barrel shapes) before
boiling them to ensure even cooking.18 small waxy potatoes (red or white)

X Salt 15 ml (1 tbsp) chopped parsley

TURN THE POTATOES:

Fill a bowl with cold water. Use a pating knife to cut the potatoes into
chunks about 6.5 cm (2.5 inches) long and 4 cm (1.5 inches) thick. Cut off
both ends of the chunks and then pare down the sides, shapine or "turning"
them into small barrel shapes with 7 faces. To prevent discoloration, hold
the finished turned potatoes in the bowl of cold water while you are
working. Drain the potatoes and put them into a saucepan with cold salted
water to cover. Bring to the boil, reduce heat to medium and cook for about
10 minutes, until tender when pierced with the point of a knife. Leave the
potatoes to stand in the cooking liquid to keep warm until serving time.
Drain the potatoes. Serve in a vegetable dish sprinkled with the parsley.
turned vegetables

GLAZING PICKLING ONIONS:

24 pickling onions, peeled 15 g (0.5 oz) butter15 ml (1 tbsp) sugar X Salt
and freshly ground pepper

Put the onions in a low-sided saucepan or frying pan large enough to hold
them in a single layer, if possible, and add just enough water to barely
cover. Season with salt and pepper, and add 15 g (1/2 oz) utter and the
sugar. Bring to the boil. Cover with a round of buttered baking parchment,
reduce the heat and simmer for 8-10 minutes. Remove the paper and continue
cooking until the liquid evaporates. (watch carefully because the onions
will burn easely.) Then continueing the onions in the butter remaining in
the pan, until golden brown. Shake the pan frequently to colour the onions
evenly.

CUTTING LARDONS:

Trim the rind from the bacon. Cut each slice lenghtwise into 3 strips and
then each strip into 1 cm (1/4 inch) cubes, known as lardons.

      Yield: 1 batch

      2 c  cloudberries
    1/2 c  port or
    1/2 c  dry red wine plus
      2 tb honey
      1 c  orange juice
    1/2 c  lemon juice
    1/2 c  chopped onion
      1 ts dry mustard
    1/2 ts ground ginger

      1 tb coarsely shredded orange 
           -rind
      1 tb coarsely shredded lemon rind
  1 1/2 tb arrowroot flour

*If you are feeling bold, try a habanero; if this is too hot for your
palette, substitute a less potent type of chile pepper.

Puree the cloudberries in a blender or food processor.

Heat the cloudberry puree in a heavy saucepan and mix in the other
ingredients except the arrowroot. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Be careful as this may foam up. Strain the sauce through a sieve and return
to the flame. Combine the arrowroot flour with a little of the hot sauce in
a cup and mix thoroughly. Stir this back into the sauce and cook over low
heat, stirring constantly, until thickened. Do not allow to boil.

Use as a sauce with roast goose, ham, pork, or game.

    1/2 lb bacon
      2 tb reserved bacon grease
      2 md onions, coarse chopped

      1 ts brown sugar
      1    masa harina [optional enough
           - to thi; cken]

Partially feeze the bear roast to make the chopping/dicing easier.
Carefully remove any and all visible fat as it gives any dish an unpleasant
flavor. In a large bowl, sprinkle the diced meat with the chili powder,
oregano, optional cayenne and cumin, stirring to mix thoroughly. Cover and
refrigerate for a few hours to allow the chili spices to marinade the meat.

Fry the bacon. Drain it on paper towels and cut into 1/2" pieces and
reserve.  Heat two tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat in a large heavy
pot over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic and green pepper and cook
until the onions are translucent. Add the diced and spiced bear meat to the
pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is evenly browned. Add the
beer, tomatoes, optional hot sauce and reserved bacon to the pot. Bring to
a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours. Add
more beer [or tomato juice or beef stock] if neccessary to prevent sticking
and scorching. Taste, adjust seasonings, and simmer for 2 hours longer. Add
the brown sugar [ and a little Masa if the chili is too thin] and simmer
for 15 minutes more.

      Title: Bacon Bbq Bird
 Categories: game, barbeque
      Yield: 4 servings

      1    8 birds of your choice

1 lb fresh bacon
1/2 c  Italian salad dressing
1 tb paprika
1 ts ground sage
1/2 ts garlic powder
:            Salt and pepper

When you BBQ smaller wild bird like dove, quail, chuckar, grouse etc., it
tends to be a little on the dry side. This recipe will definitely fix that.

Marinate birds in Italian salad dressing overnight. Pat dry, season with
paprika, ground sage, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste. Wrap each
bird with bacon slices. If you use more than one slice of bacon to cover
the bird match the seams on the same side. Place the birds on a medium-hot
grill, bacon seam side down. Cover and grill for 15 minutes. Turn and grill
another 15 minutes. Test the bird with a fork, if it is not tender cook an
additional 15 minutes.

Baked beans, stuffing, fresh vegetables, and bread of your choice would be
an excellent complement for this entree. After your birds are done throw
the bacon into your pot of baked beans for excellent seasoning. This recipe
also works very well with Cornish game hens.

      Title: Alder Cone Smoked Grouse With Fern Root Glaze & Salal Sau
 Categories: poultry, game, sauces, ethnic, native
      Yield: 4 servings

      2 tb licorice fern root
      2 tb gewurztraminer icewine
    3/4 c  water
      3 c  dried alder cones
      2    wild grouse breasts, bone in
           - and sk; inless
      1    juniper & salal berry sauce:
  1 1/3 c  water
  1 1/2 c  b.c. pinot blanc wine
  3 1/2 c  salal berries
  1 1/2 tb maple syrup
  1 1/2 tb black peppercorns
      8    juniper berries
  1 1/2 tb balsamic vinegar

Recipe from Northern Bounty: A Celebration of Canadian Cuisine. The ISBN is
0-394-22431-0. Recipe by Sinclair Philip, owner of the Sooke Harbour House
on Vancouver Island.  Sinclair believes in local ingredients, freshness and
learning about and using wild ingredients from the native peoples. His
restaurant has vegetable and herb gardens full of plants transplanted from
the bush for use in the kitchen. At Sooke, chefs prepare this dish with a
salad of foraged wild greens and flowers: amaranth, chicory, chickweed,
lamb's quarters, orache, shepherd's purse, and sorrel.

Alder: a deciduous tree, member of the birch family with woody cone like
fruits. Common in swamps and mountainous areas. [ I am going to try black
spruce cones- our commonest local tree. If that doesn't work I can fall
back on store bought fruit wood chips or do a Chinese Tea Smoke.- JW]

Licorice Fern: I have no idea what it's geographic range is or what flavor
it's root would impart. Based on it's name I am going to try diced Fennel
bulb, Fennel seed or a _wee_ bit of Star Anise stewed in Port instead.-JW

Salal Berries: Salal is a low [up to 2 meter] evergreen shrub of the Heath
family native to California, B.C. and Alaska with white to pink urn shaped
flowers and round purple berries which turn black. [ There are none locally
so I will be experimenting with cranberries or black currants.- JW]

Directions:

In a small covered sauce pan, gently simmer fern root in icewine and water
for 20 min. Pour into a glass jar, seal and let stand at room temp for 12
hours. Strain into a small saucepan and boil, uncovered, on high until
reduced to a thick syrup. Set aside.

Heat alder cones in a large aluminum foil lined sauce pan over high heat
until they smoulder. Reduce heat to low; place grouse breasts directly on
top of the smouldering cones. Lightly brush the breasts with the fern root
glaze; cover pan tightly. Smoke breasts for 3 hours or until cooked but not
dry. Remove the meat from the bone and serve with Juniper-Salal Berry
Sauce.

For the sauce: Pour 1 cup water and the wine into the bottom of a per-
forated double boiler. Place the salal berries in the top section. Cover;
simmer gently for two hours. Gently press berries with a rubber spatula to
extract remaining juice. Discard berries; reserving syrup in the bottom of
the double boiler.

To the salal syrup, add the maple syrup, peppercorns, juniper berries,
remaining water and balsamic vinegar. Bring to the boil and immediately
remove from the heat; let stand an hour before returning to the heat. Cook,
uncovered, until slightly thickened. Refrigerate until needed.

Drop the fat on the stone griddle and let it float out over the stone so
that you have a well greased spot large enough to place the steaks on. Cook
for 15 to 20 minutes on each side.  If you have plenty of wild onion, slice
the onion thinly and fry it with the steaks.

      Title: Indian Jerky
 Categories: meats, game, preserves, native
      Yield: 50 pounds

      3 ga water
      2 lb dry brown sugar
      1 oz saltpeter
      1 oz cayenne pepper
      1 c  juniper berries, crushed
      1    whole piece ginger

Bring water to a boil and add remining ingredients. Boil for 5 minutes.
Remove scum as it appears.  Cool and store in a wooden barrel or
earthenware crock.

Jerky is dried meat, cut in long strips from large game or beef.  To
prepare sun-dried jerky, cut fresh meat into long thi  strips about an inch
wide and an inch thick.  Rub the strips with salt and hang, spaced well
apart on racks, in the sun to dry.  When dry, store in sacks hung in a dry
place.

Jerky can also be made by placing the strips in a corning solution for 3 or
4 days, then hung on racks over a slow burning smoky fire for about 2 days.
The strips should be placed well apart to keep them from touching each
other.  When dry, the strips should be wrapped in a protective covering
such as cheesecloth to keep insects and dirt from settling on them.

Jerky will keep dry as long as it is exposed to the air and smoke. It is
important not to leave it longer than a couple of days.  Then take it down
and store it in air-tight jars or other containers.

      Title: Bill's Venison Or Buffalo Roast
 Categories: game, native
      Yield: 1 guideline

      1    no ingredients

Soak roast overnight in saltwater.  Rinse and dry off.  Cut slits in top
side of roast about 2-3 inches apart, depending on how spicy you want it.
Alternate 1/2 clove of garlic and slices of green serano or jalapeno
peppers.  Turn the roast over, repeat.  Do not add spices or salt.

Cover roast HEAVILY all over with cheap prepared mustard.  Put in dry pan.
Cover heavily with yellow onion sliced in rings.  Cover.  Put in preheated
300 degree oven.  Roast til it's really tender, slice across grain, serve
with brown or wild rice and greens.

Buffalo needs to be cooked at a low heat for a long time to make it tender.
If you try to cook it on too high a heat, it will get tough, never, never
to get tender again.

This was Bill's Grandma Johnson's recipe for venison roast, but we used it
on buffalo, too, and it was great.

      Title: How To Cook A Whale Found Dead
 Categories: fish, game, native
      Yield: 100 servings

      1    whale

This is my 1995 translation of the George Hunt 1914 translation of a old
Kwakuitl recipe given by Elie Hunt in the Kwakuitl language

"Most importantly, you cannot eat it all by yourself! So the first step is
to call for a party and invite all your friends, relatives, and local
dignitaries.

A special occasion, like the finding of a whale, calls for the use of
ceremonial names.  Though a hunter, a man, has found the whale, preparing
food is women's work, and therefore the daughter of the hunter has the
rights to prepare the whale.  She is given the ceremonial name,
Place-of-cutting-Blubber.  Note that it is the daughter who has the rights,
not the wife(s), due to the family rights in a matrilineal society.

Once everybody is ready, you bring tools, and the hunter who found the
whale leads everybody in their canoes to the spot where he found it. The
father of the hunter has the honor of speaking for the daughter of the
hunter to "make a toast" for the occasion.  It is customary to first
declare how wonderful the whale is, being full of delicious blubber, etc.
Then you should give the choicest piece (the dorsal fin) to the ranking
dignitary, who is typically the chief of the village.

Everybody else gets an equal size piece of the whale according to the order
of their rank.  The first piece starts at the whale neck, and they work
from the top down and from the head to the tail.  Generally the pieces are
cut about a fathom (6 feet) in width.  After the ceremonial pieces are
given out, the women go to work to gather the remaining fat from the whale.
The last step is cut off a piece of the tail of the whale.

When this is done, the pieces are loaded in the canoes, and everybody goes
home to do the remainder of the preparation.  The hunks of blubber are
split into strips four fingers thick (two inches).  These pieces are then
cut into half inch strips.

A kettle of water is set to boil on the beach, and the strips are boiled to
render the oil.  The oil is ladled off and stored in watertight storage
boxes.  Whale oil is best stored in the corner of your house.

Then, you take cedar bark, and split it into long strips.  Poke holes in
the middle of the boiled pieces of whale blubber, and thread them onto the
long strips of bark.  When finish these strings of blubber are now called
"tied-in-the-middle".

Dry these strips in the smoky rafters of your house for at least a month.
When you want to eat some "tied-in-the-middle" take it down from the
rafters, and boil it in a kettle until tender.  This takes a lot of
boiling.  Be sure to eat it hot, because when it is cold, it is really
tough.  If you boil more than you can eat, you can dry it again, and reheat
it later.  This dish is called "eating boiled blubber tied in the middle",
a real treat!"

      Title: About Rabbit
 Categories: game, info
      Yield: 1 text file

      1    no ingredients

Rabbit, squirrel, muskrat and ground hog may all be used in any chicken
recipes. Handle rabbit with gloves when cleaning to avoid the possibility
of Tularemia infection. Cook the meat to well-done. The meat is tenderest
if hung 2-4 days or cooked when VERY fresh, before rigor mortis sets in.
Wild rabbit has dark meat; many domestic hares have all white meat.

To dress: sever the front legs at the first joint and discard. Cut through
the skin around the hind legs across the hip. Peel down the skin off the
legs. Tie the hind feet together and hang over a hook. The skin will pull
down over the upper legs, body and then the forelegs. Pull it over the
head, then sever and discard the head and skin. Alternatively in the field
step on the front paws and tug upwards on the back leg skin and then stand
on the hind paws and pull upwards to peel the skin over the head.

Gut and clean, retaining the heart and liver. Wash the carcass in acidified
water ie water with a dash of vinegar. Rinse, pat dry with paper towels and
sprinkle lightly with pepper.

To cut into serving pieces: Rabbit is carved differently than chicken. The
best way is to sever the four legs and cut the back into three sections for
a total of seven portions.

      Title: Game Cooking
 Categories: game, info
      Yield: 1 text file

Venison is the generic term for meat from a large group of related grazing
animals. It includes caribou, reindeer, deer, moose and elk. For all
practical purposes it also includes musk oxen, antelope and buffalo
[bison]. The recipes are generally interchangeable. Musk oxen and buffalo
cuts tend to be more tender as these animals are more sedentary by nature.

You can do anything with venison that you would beef. Just remember that it
is drier- less fat, so steaks should be marinaded/tenderized/pounded and
cooked just to medium, not over-done.

It is important to realize that wild meat can vary in quality and
toughness, whereas commercial beef is a pretty uniform product. Venison
factors are:

~1- Age and sex of animal. Meat can be as tender and mild as veal in a
young doe. (And you always get steer meat in a store never bull. Castration
does make a difference.)

~2-Clean kill. If a deer is stalked while it is peacefully grazing and
dropped dead in its tracks, it will taste far better than an animal that
has been chased by hounds, then gut shot, then it runs a few more miles
before collapsing. The blood is full of adrenaline and the acidic
by-products of exercise and exertion and the flesh is tainted by the torn
up organs.

~3- Aging and butchering. When I was a kid growing up in Eastern Ontario,
we went deer hunting in the fall, when it was cool and deer were hung to
age and tenderize, then butchered at a local abattoir that handled beef and
pork professionally. We received nicely wrapped, properly cut and trimmed
frozen packages. It was generally pretty good. Up here caribou is shot all
year long and traditionally butchered immediately [before it spoils in the
summer or freezes solid in the winter] And some hunters are more skilled at
butchering than others... I have been made "gifts" of quarters of caribou
that have been field frozen with the fur on and wrapped in green garbage
bags and stored in somebody's back yard for a month or two! I have also
received superb sausages made by a man who apprenticed as a sausage-maker
in Germany.

If you know where your meat came from, you will know whether it should
tenderized or just cooked.

If your steaks are coming from a commercial game farm, they will be from a
young animal, carefully slaughtered and aged. I would treat them the same
as any prime beef T-bone. Probably charcoal BBQ'd or gas grilled to just
medium rare and sprinkled with a little salt and pepper AFTER it has been
cooked... nothing fancy, no marinades and no strong BBQ sauces. That way
you will be able to truly taste the venison.

For wild meat you may want to marinade first, if it's tough.

      Title: About Cooking Wild Ducks
 Categories: game, info
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    text file

You *CANNOT* use the same recipes on a wild duck that you'd use on a
domestic one.  Because they are so lean, they will cook very fast. My
favorite technique, beside besides simply roasting them over a mirepoix, is
to saute the breast over high heat in either a bit of olive oil or brown
butter just long enough to sear the exterior, but not so long that they are
cooked through.  They should be rare.  They are then removed from the pan
and kept warm (on a platter at the rear of the range or in a slow oven)
while a reduction sauce is prepared in the pan. Any number of classic
sauces go well with duck prepared in this manner; I generally begin by
sauteing some shallots in butter, deglazing with a good, fruity red wine,
reducing by half, and then adding a bit of brown stock and finishing it
with a swirl of butter. Garlic, minced gingerroot, or some crushed herbs
can be added to the sauteed shallots as desired. You could also substitute
some heavy cream for the stock. To serve, sauce a plate, thickly slice the
duck breast across the grain diagonally, place in the sauce on the plate
and drizzle a little of the remaining sauce over the cut slices. Add your
favorite accompaniments, potatoes or rice and whatever... Serve some of the
wine that was used to make the sauce.

There are any number of variations on the above theme:  sometimes I cold
smoke the duck with a fruitwood or nutwood fire -- apple or pecan is my
favorite before searing, and then toss some of the complimentary fruit or
nuts in with the sauteing shallots when I make the sauce.

You can accomplish pretty much the same thing over an open grill, and
_really_ impress the chicks, but the key is to be sure to remove the breast
from the heat well before they are cooked through. The classic way of
determining when you have reached the right stage is this: Make a fist with
your thumb tucked inside. With the forefinger of your opposite hand,
rapidly press down on the exposed muscle pad at the base of your thumb of
your fisted hand.  That's the feel the duck breast should return when it's
ready to be removed from the heat.

      Title: About Cooking Wild Ducks #2
 Categories: poultry, game, info
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    text file

The canvasback, depending on its diet before you shot it, can be very tasty
indeed.  I would recommend the following preparation:

Pluck and draw the duck.  Remove the breasts but do NOT skin.  Use a filet
knife to do this part and be careful around the wishbone or you'll miss a
bunch of meat.

Refrigerate the breasts (wrap in plastic).  Roast the carcass until browned
(350 for an hour will do).  Take the carcass and place it in a large stock
pot.  Cover bones with cold water, add a quartered onion, skin and all
(Videllia (sp?) 1015 or some other sweet variety is my
preference)quartered. Add a carrot and a couple of cloves of fresh garlic.
Simmer stock at least 3 hours (I cook mine all night at a very low temp -
bubbles rise very slow and not too often). strain the stock and reserve.

For the sauce, add a 1/4 cup of clover honey to a 1.5 quart sauce pan. heat
over medium heat until the honey starts to slightly darken. Remove from the
heat and add 2/3 cup of a nice white wine (the better the wine the better
the sauce - don't use any cheap stuff).  Return to high heat and reduce by
half.  Add 3 cups of duck stock and reduce until it gives a demi-glaze
sauce consistency (about 2/3 of a cup remains). Add a tablespoon of hoisen
(you can get this in the oriental section of your grocery) and mix in for
about a minute. remove from the heat. Optionally, you can add a tablespoon
of butter once completed.

Right before your sauce is ready, salt and pepper your duck breasts. Heat a
cast-iron or other type of non-stick skillet to medium high. Put the
breasts in skin side down and cook until skin becomes somewhat crisp. Turn
and cook for about a minute on the other side. The duck should be rare
(I've never gotten sick from eating rare duck. If wild duck is over cooked
it doesn't taste near as good - the difference is like night and day).

Slice the breast long ways and ladle sauce on top.  Serve with the
remaining white wine and vegetables of choice.  This is an easy recipe that
will make duck lovers out of most anyone.

      Title: Cider Squirrels Southern Style
 Categories: main dish, game, southern, alcohol
      Yield: 4 servings

      4 lg squirrels (gray, fox, or 
           -black), or; 2 rabbits
      1    flour
      1    salt and pepper
    1/4 ts powdered sage
    1/4 ts powdered rosemary
      3 tb bacon or sausage fat
      1 qt dry cider
      4 tb butter
      1 c  heavy cream

Skin, eviscerate, and disjoint  the squirrels, making sure to remove the
small scent sacs from beneath the forelegs.  If these glands are not
removed, a bitter taste will be imparted to the dish.  Soak the pieces for
one hour in cold water to which 1 teaspoon salt has been added. Remove,
drain, and pat dry.

Roll the pieces in flour seasoned with salt, pepper, sage and rosemary.
(Prepared poultry seasoning is a good substitute.)  Heat the bacon fat in a
deep skillet and brown the squirrel pieces on all sides. Add the cider and
simmer until the meat is alnost tender. Remove the cover and continue
cooking until the meat is tender and most of the liquid absorbed. Remove
the squirrel pieces and put aside to cool. Reserve any pan liquids for the
gravy.

Roll the squirrel in the seasoned flour again, heat the butter in another
skillet, and rebrown the squirrel until golden and crisp. Put the squirrel
pieces on a heated platter, and keep warm, while you add all juices and
scrapings to the skillet.  Make a paste of a tablespoon of flour and the
heavy cream.  Pour this slowly into the pan juices, stirring constantly,
until the sauce is smooth, hot, and slightly thick. Ladle the gravy over
the squirrel pieces and serve.

      Title: Alma's Recipe For 'possum
 Categories: meats, game, southern
      Yield: 6 servings

    1/2 c  lime
      1 g  water
      1 c  salt
      1    red pepper pod
      1    possum

Put 1/2 cup lime in about 1 gallon of boiling water and scald quickly, and
pull off hair while hot.  Scrape well--remove feet, tail, and
entrails--like you would a pig.  Cut off ears, remove eyes and head if
desired.  Pour hot water over it and clean thoroughly.

Put one cup salt in sufficient cold water to cover possum, add 1 pod red
pepper and let stand overnight.  In the morning remove salt water and pour
boiling water over it.  Cook in enough boiling water to boil up over possum
but not enough to cover.  Cook until skin can be pierced with a fork
easily, and let stand in water until ready for baking.

When ready to bake, place possum in pan with skin side up.  Bake in a
moderate oven until crisp and brown.  If fire is too hot, skin will blister
and burn.

Carve possum and surround with potatoes (sliced or quartered) which have
been previously baked.
