Chocolate Devastation  (Part 1)

chocolate, ice cream

      ----CHOCOLATE RAISIN ICE CREAM----
2 cup raisins
1/2 cup jack daniel's whiskey
8 oz semi-sweet chocolate
2 cup heavy cream
1 cup half & half
2 oz unsweet chocolate
8  egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar
      ----MOCHA MERINGUE----
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
8  egg whites
3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon instant espresso
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/8 teaspoon salt
      ----BITTERSWEET GANACHE----
2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 tablespoon sugar
8 oz semi-sweet chocolate
4 oz unsweetened chocolate

Combine the raisins and whiskey in a plastic container with a tight
fitting lid. Allow to stand at room temperature for 6 hours or
overnight. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler
over medium heat. Place 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, 1/2 cup heavy
cream, and 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate in the top half of the
double boiler. Tightly cover the top with ilm wrap. Heat for 10
minutes, then remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Transfer to
a stainless steel bowl and set aside until needed. Heat the remaining
1 1/2 c heavy cream and the half-and-half in a 2 1/2-qt. saucepan
over medium-high heat. Bring the cream to a boil. While the cream is
heating, place 8 egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar in the bowl of an
electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the eggs on high for 2 to 2
1/2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Continue to beat on
high until slightly thickened and lemon-colored, about 2 1/2 to 3
minutes. (At this point, the cream should be boiling. If not, adjust
the mixer speed to low and continue to mix until the cream boils. If
this is not done, the egg yolks will develop undesirable lumps.) Pour
the boiling cream into the beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine.
Return to the saucepan and heat over medium-high heat, stirring
constantly, until the cream reaches a temperature of 185~, 2-4
minutes. Then pour into the melted chocolate mixture, and stir to
combine. Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath to a temperature of
40-45~, about 15-20 minutes. Line 2, 8" cake pans with enough film
wrap to cover the insides of the pan. Set aside until needed. Fold
the whiskey-soaked raisins and any residual liquid into the cooled
chocolate custard mixture. Freeze in an ice cream freezer following
the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the semi-frozen ice cream
to the 2 cake pans, evenly dividing the ice cream between the two
pans. Use a rubber spatula to spread the ice cream evenly to the
edges of the pans. Tightly cover the tops of the pans with film wrap,
then place in the freezer for at least 12 hours before assembling the
cake. See part 2 for rest of directions.

Chocolate Devastation (Part 2)

chocolate, ice cream

1 x no ingredients

MOCHA MERINGUE: Using a 9" cake circle (or cake plate) as a guide,
trace a circle on each of 3 sheets of parchment paper (cut to fit the
baking sheets) with a pencil. Turn each sheet of parchment paper over
and place with the trace mark down on a baking sheet. Preheat the
oven to 250~. Combine together in a sifter the confectioners' sugar,
cornstarch, and cocoa. Sift onto the wax paper and set aside until
needed. Heat 1" of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over
medium-high heat. Place 8 egg whites, 3/4 cup sugar, the espresso
powder, the cream of tartar, and the salt in the top half of the
double boiler. Heat the egg white mixture to a temperature of 120~
while gently and constantly whisking, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer the
mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a balloon whip.
Whisk on high until stiff but not dry, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.
Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to fold in
the sifted dry ingredients. Fill a pastry bag (with no tip) with
about a third of the meringue. Fill a traced circle with meringue:
start in the center and pipe a 1/2" wide spiral toward the ouside of
the circle. Fill the pastry bag again and repeat this procedure with
each of the 2 remaining circles (each circle should be filled with
about a third of the original amount of meringue.) Place the
meringues in the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour. Reduce the oven
temperature to 225~ and bake for an additional 2 hours. Cool on
baking sheets for 30 minutes before handling.
THE GANACHE: Heat 2 cups heavy cream, the butter, and 2 tablespoons
sugar in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir
to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil. Place 8 oz
semi-sweet chocolate and 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate in a
stainless bowl. Pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow
to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Reserve 1 cup of ganache
and set aside at room temperature. Pour the remaining amount of
ganache onto a baking sheet with sides and refrigerate for 35-40
minutes. Pour 1/4 cup of the reserved room-temperature ganache onto
the center of a baked meringue (supported by a cake circle). Remove
an ice-cream disk from the freezer. Unwrap the disk and place it onto
the puddle of ganache. Press down on the ice cream disk gently but
firmly (this will spread the ganache). Fill a pastry bag fitted with
a medium-sized star tip with one-third of the chilled ganache. Pipe
about 28-30 individual vertical strips 1 1/2" long and 3/4" wide--all
the way around the side of the ice cream disk (each strip should be
touching the other, and each strip should also be wider at the base
where it touches the meringue and tapered at the crest where it rises
to the top edge of the ice cream disk). Place this section into the
freezer and repeat the preceding procedure with another meringue and
ice cream disk. Place in the freezer after completion for about 10-15
minutes. Remove a meringue and ice cream section from the freezer.
Pour 1/4 cup of room-temperature ganache onto the center of the ice
cream. Remove the second section from the freezer, and center onto
the first. Press down on the ice cream, gently but firmly, to spread
the ganache. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup of room-temperature genache
onto the top ice cream disk, and onto this ganache place the
remaining baked meringue, once again pressing down gently but firmly
to spread the ganache. Place the Devastation in the freezer for about
10-15 minutes. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium-sized star tip
with the remaining chilled ganache. Remove the Devastation from the
freezer. Starting 1/2" inside the edge of the top meringue, pipe a
ring of about 28-30 individual strips--1 1/2" long and 3/4" wide--all
the way around the top (each strip should be touching the other, and
each strip should also be wider at the point closest to the edge and
tapered at the point closest to the center). Return the completed
Devastation to the freezer for at least 1 hour before serving. To
serve, cut the Devastation with a serrated slicer. Heat the blade of
the slicer under hot running water before making each slice. Allow
the slices to come

Chocolate-Fresh Spearmint Ice Cream

ice cream

1 1/2 cup whipping cream
1 1/2 cup milk
2/3 cup sugar
3  egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 oz semisweet chocolate
2 oz unsweetened chocolate
1 cup fresh spearmint leaves*
2 tablespoon fresh spearmint leaves; chopped

*Leaves are "hardpacked:" measure by pressing down on leaves in
measuring cup with your fingers.

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan or double boiler over medium-low heat,
stir and heat the cream, milk, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
Do not boil.

In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks lightly. While whisking, pour 1
cup of the hot cream mixture into the bowl, then pour the egg mixture
back into the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir
constantly with a wooden spoon (don't let the mixture boil; it could
curdle) for about 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and coats
the spoon. To test for doneness, dip a metal spoon into the mixture
and run your finger across the back. The custard is done when your
finger leaves a clear, clean trail. A candy thermometer should read
175-180 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
vanilla.

While heating the ice-cream base, melt the chocolate in a double
boiler over hot but not simmering water, stirring occasionally.

Off heat, pour about 1 cup of the prepared hot ice-cream base into the
melted chocolate and whisk until well blended. Pour the chocolate
mixture back into the remaining vanilla base and whisk again. Stir in
the hard-packed mint leaves. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for
at least 1 hour. The longer it is refrigerated, the stronger the mint
flavor will be.

Strain the mixture and add the chopped mint leaves. Pour the mixture
into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

5  egg yolks

EQUIPMENT: 2 baking sheets with sides, 2 large 100%-cotton towels,
food processor with metal blade, 2 2 1/2-qt saucepans, metal spoon, 2
2-quart plastic containers with lids, double boiler, electric mixer
fitted with a paddle, rubber spatula, 2 stainless steel bowls (1
large), instant-read test thermometer, ice-cream freezer

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast and skin the hazelnuts, then
allow the nuts to cool to room temperature. In the bowl of a food
processor fitted with a metal blade, chop the hazelnuts into pieces
1/8 inch in size. Spread the chopped hazelnuts onto a baking sheet
with sides.

Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt
saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist
sand). Caramelize the sugar for 4 1/2 to 5 minutes over medium-high
heat, stirring constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the
sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it
caramelizes). Pour the caramelized sugar over the chopped hazelnuts.
Stir the mixture with a spoon, then spread it into an uneven mass,
about 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Allow the pralines to cool to room
temperature. Break the pralines into uneven pieces, then place in the
bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Chop the pralines
into 1/8-inch pieces. Transfer the chopped pralines to a plastic
container with a lid. Freeze until needed. Makes 1 1/2 quarts

develop undesirable lumps. Pour the boiling cream into the beaten egg
yolks and whisk to combine. Return to the saucepan and heat over
medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the cream reaches a
temperature of 185 degrees, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and

gradually beat in sugar until stiff and glossy. Gently fold together
whites, cooled chocolate, egg mixture, cream and nuts, taking care to
keep mixture light. Turn into a freezer container and freeze at least
4 hours. Let stand a couple of hours in refrigerator to soften before

1 pint chocolate ice cream
1/2 cup chocolate syrup
24  amaretti cookies
1/4 cup chambord
1/2 pint fresh raspberries

1/2-qt. saucepan, whisk, metal spoon, cook's knife, cutting board, 2-qt.
plastic container w/ lid, electric mixer with paddle, rubber spatula,
instant-read test thermometer, 2 stainless steel bowls (1 large), ice cream
freezer

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast the pecan halves on a baking sheet
in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
Combine 1 1/4 cups of sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan.
Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand).
Caramelize the sugar for 8 to 10 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring
constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar will first turn
clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it caramelizes). Remove the
saucepan from the heat. Add the unsweetened chocolate and stir gently to
blend. Pour the chocolate-caramel mixture over the pecans and stir with a
spoon to completely coat the pecans with the chocolate caramel; spread the
mixture evenly over the bottom of the baking sheet. Freeze the chocolate
pecan crunch for 20 minutes. Remove from the freezer. Chop the chocolate
pecan crunch into 1/4" pieces. Store in a sealed plastic container in the
freezer until needed.

White Chocolate Lasagna With Peanut Ice Cream

chocolate, deserts, ice cream

3 1/2 cup half & half
8  egg yolks
1 3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup unsalted dry-roasted peanuts, coars; ely chopped (about 5 oz)
3 oz bars white chocolate, broken in hal; f widthwise
16 oz bittersweet chocolate
8 oz unsalted butter
1 cup evaporated milk

Servings:  4

Mint sprigs for garnish

In medium saucepan, scald the half & half over medium heat, set
aside. In medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 3/4 cup sugar, a
pinch of salt, and 1 tsp of the vanilla. Gradually whisk in the half
& half and transfer to the saucepan.  Cook this mixture over moderate
heat, stirring constantly, until just thick enough to coat the back
of a spoon (165 on a candy thermometer). This will take 10-15
minutes. DO NOT bring to a boil or you'll have a curdled mess on your
hands. Remove from heat and whisk in the peanut butter, then add the
cream. Strain this custard into a bowl and refrigerate, stirring
occasionally, until well chilled. In the meantime, line a 10-by-15
inch jelly roll pan with wax paper. Transfer custard to a Donvier or
other ice cream freezer and freeze until thickened but still
pourable.  Add peanuts.  Pour mixture into the jelly roll pan, spread
evenly, cover, and freeze overnight.

Prepare sugar syrup by mixing the remaining 1 cup of sugar with 1 cup
of water.  Bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar, then remove from
heat and set aside 'til later.

Preheat oven on lowest setting for 5 minutes, then turn it off. Place
the 6 pieces of white chocolate on a large baking sheet lined with
wax paper. Place in the warm oven until soft enough to yield when
pressed by a finger, about 6 minutes.  Using a metal spatula,
transfer a piece of softened chocolate to an individual piece of wax
paper (at least 12 inches long) and cover with a second sheet of
paper.  Using a large heavy rolling pin, gently roll the chocolate
between the paper to form a thin sheet of chocolate, about 11 by 4
inches. Set each sheet of chocolate aside while you repeat this with
the rest of the chocolate. Line 3 baking sheets with wax paper.  When
the white chocolate is cooled and firm, remove the top piece of paper
from each chocolate sheet. Using a pizza wheel or long sharp knife,
trim the edges of each sheet to make a neat 3-by-10-inch rectangle,
then cut each rectangle crosswise to form two 3-by-5-inch pieces.
Transfer 4 rectangles to each of the prepared baking sheets. Keep
cool.

In a double boiler, melt the bittersweet chocolate with the butter,
stirring until smooth.  Transfer to a bowl. Whisk in 1 cup of the
reserved sugar syrup. Stir in the evaporated milk and 1 tsp. vanilla.
Set aside, covered.  Note:  this sauce can be made up to 1 week in
advance and kept, covered, in the fridge.

With a pizza cutter or thin sharp knife, cut the ice cream into ten 3
by-5-inch rectangles.  There will be a little left over; do what you
will with it. ;-) With a spatula, place a piece of the ice cream on
each of the 4 pieces of white chocolate.  Top each with another piece
of chocolate, then another layer of ice cream, then another piece of
chocolate. Freeze for 3 to 4 hours.

To serve, remove the assembled lasagnas from the freezer and allow to
soften slightly at room temperature for a few minutes. Gently reheat
the fudge sauce in the top of a double boiler or in the microwave.
Place each of the portions to serving plates, spoon fudge sauce over,
garnish with mint, and serve immediately.
