      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 c  Wild rice
    1/2 c  Pearl barley
    1/2 c  Brown rice
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
      4    Garlic cloves; chopped
      4 tb Unsalted butter or margarine
           -OR- Oil
    1/2 lb Mushrooms; thickly sliced
  3 1/2 c  Broth
      1 ts Crushed dried thyme
    1/2 ts Crushed dried oregano
           Salt & pepper; to taste
 
  Combine grains in a mixing bowl and set aside. Pour the oil into a 2-3 qt.
  casserole which is safe for both stovetop and oven cooking, and place on
  med. heat. When hot , saute onion and garlic until tender and translucent,
  about 5-6 mins. Add the mixed grains and saute for 1 min., stirring
  constantly.
  
  Meanwhile melt butter or margarine (if using) in a separate pan on med.
  high heat. When hot , add mushrooms and saute quickly, stirring frequently,
  until the shrooms are hot and have just absorbed the "butter" (about 1
  min.). Immediately remove from heat.
  
  Add the broth, herbs, and mushrooms to the casserole with the onions and
  grains, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cover
  tightly (use aluminum foil between pot and cover if necessary for a good
  seal), and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hr.
  
  NOTES: I use alot less oil (only as much as needed to keep things from
  sticking in my cast-iron dutch oven), add hot peppers and fresh herbs
  (rosemary is especially delicious; i dislike dried oregano so i use less or
  none), add soy sauce instead of salt, and saute the mushrooms first in the
  same pan (taking them out when done) so i dont have to wash two pans
  :^>. Frankly i can't see where they get 8 servings from, this lasts me
  maybe 3 meals....It's really a hearty dish, so save it for a cold day (some
  of us still have a few left, despite the advent of spring). Enjoy!
  
  (8 servings as a side dish, less as an entree)

      Title: RIVERSIDE KEDGEREE
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Cold cooked salmon or trout*
      1 lg Cucumber
      1 bn Watercress
    1/4 lb Shelled young peas
      8 oz Brown rice
      2 oz Butter
           A little caster sugar
           A little tarragon vinegar
 
  *Note: Salmon, sea trout or river trout may be used (farmed trout is
  unsuitable - its texture is too soft).
  
  Peel and seed the cucumber and cut the flesh into pieces no larger than
  matchsticks.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and caster sugar and 1
  teaspoon tarragon vinegar.  Toss lightly and set aside for at least 40
  minutes, or all day if you prefer, to draw out some of the cucumber juices.
  Drain well and pat dry.
  
  Cook the rice in double its volume of boiling salted water or, better
  still, in fish stock.  It will take about 35 minutes to become tender.
  Towards the end of this time cook the vegetables.  Boil the peas in a
  little lightly sugared water.  Melt the butter in a flameproof casserole,
  add the sticks of cucumber and cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes,
  just stirring occasionally.  Break the skinned and boned fish into big
  flaky chunks.  Lay the fish on top of the cucumber - don't stir it in.
  Cover the casserole and reduce heat as low as possible.  Leave to cook,
  just shaking the casserole occasionally, until the cucumber is tender and
  the fish is well heated through - 4 minutes or so.  Meanwhile put the
  watercress into a food-processor and reduce it to green flecks.
  
  To assemble the kedgeree, add the prepared watercress, peas and cooked rice
  to the buttery fish and cucumber mixture.  Immediately draw the casserole
  away from the heat and season it generously with sea salt and freshly
  ground black pepper.  Toss the ingredients gently but thoroughly to mix
  them well and serve straight away with a large fresh green salad, or with a
  tomato salad if you prefer. Serves 4-6.

 Categories: Seafood, Rice
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 sm Smoked mackerel
           -OR- smoked trout
  2 1/2 oz Chopped, toasted hazelnuts
           -OR- walnuts
      1 lb Seedless grapes
    1/2 lb Brown rice
           Fresh mint or watercress
      2    Lemons
           A little sunflower oil
    1/2 pt Creamy yoghurt (or more)
 
  Cook the rice in double its volume of fast boiling salted water.  Refresh
  it and dress it with 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon oil and plenty
  of salt and pepper.  Stir in the nuts and 5-6 tablespoons chopped mint or
  watercress.  (Watercress is good but mint is even better for this dish.)
  Press the mixture firmly into a lightly oiled ring mould, cover and chill
  for a couple of hours or more.
  
  Close to serving time, halve the grapes and toss them in the juice of half
  a lemon plus scant 1 tablespoon oil.  Add some mint or watercress sprigs.
  Skin, bone and flake the fish and mix it in gently.  Unmould the ring of
  rice, put some of the fish and grape mixture into the centre and garnish
  with sprigs of mint or watercress.  Serve the rest of the fish mixture in a
  separate bowl, and hand round the well-chilled yoghurt in a second bowl.

      Title: WHOLE-GRAIN BREAKFAST CEREAL
 Categories: Breakfast, Digest
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Whole wheat berries
      1 c  Whole rye berries
      1 c  Whole triticale
      1 c  Whole barley
      1 c  Brown rice
      1 c  Buckwheat groats
      1 c  Millet
      1 c  Sesame seeds
      1 c  Flaxseed
      1 c  Lentils
     10 c  Oat groats
 
  I mix it up, then cook a pot of it by measuring 2 cups of cereal to 5 cups
  of water, bringing it to boil, & then letting it sit over night. Then I
  have a bowlful each morning, heated in the microwave until the cooked
  cereal is gone and I need to make more. Or you could do the same with a
  smaller amount, for one serving, say, try 1/4 cup of cereal. It's very
  chewy and satisfying. And of course lots of whole grains. Sometimes I just
  use oatmeal instead of oat groats, since they are difficult to find and I
  like the consistency that oatmeal adds. In the book he has a little
  paragraph about each grain, explaining what vitamins/minerals it has & what
  it's good for.

      6 c  Cooked brown rice
 
  (This is real good and hot, so you may want to tone down hot spices and add
  them last, to taste, if you can't tolerate the spicy heat.)
  
  Wash beans and then soak for 12 hours.  (I never soak beans and never have
  any gas unless I eat them with milk.)
  
  Drain water.  Fill a large pot with beans; add water to 1/2 inch above
  beans level.  Add remaining ingredients except rice; cook over low heat 2
  to 2 1/2 hours, covered.  Serve over cooked brown rice.

  I got this recipe from the January 94 issue of Shape magazine, in an
  article about the Cooper Clinic (I believe it's in Texas).  I didn't want
  to post without trying first, So last weekend I tried it and it's
  wonderful!

      Title: BURGER MIX
 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 c  Dry chickpeas
    1/2 c  Dry soybeans
    1/2 c  Dry lentils
    1/2 c  Yellow split peas
    1/2 c  Brown rice
    1/2 c  Rolled oats
    1/4 c  Whole wheat bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
  1 1/2 tb Baking soda
        x  Seasonings of your choice
           (see note)
 
  Put the ingredients 1-2 at a time in a blender, turn the blender on, and
  RUN FOR COVER (this is pretty noisy <g>).  When everything is in powdered
  form, combine in a tupperware container and store in the fridge.  Makes 4
  cups of mix.
  
  To make burgers, combine 1 c. burger mix and 2/3 c. HOT liquid (see note 2)
  and let sit for 15 minutes.  On a plate, form into 3 thin patties.  Use a
  spatula to move patties onto a nonstick-sprayed skillet and cook on both
  sides until lightly browned.  Serve with your favorite burger fixins.
  
  Note - Seasonings:  You can use the herbs and/or spices of your choice, or
  consider using a dry soup mix run through the blender (I'll bet onion would
  be good).  Also, try a dry FF salad dressing mix.  Or a veggie boullion
  cube run through the blender.  Other suggestions:  onion powder, garlic
  powder, lemon pepper, basil, etc.
  
  Note - Liquids:  Try 1/3 c. water and 1/3 c. barbeque sauce - combine in
  bowl and nuke until hot , add to dry mix (note that burgers made with
  barbeque sauce will brown more quickly, so watch them!).  Or try half
  water, half tomato juice, or half water and half white wine or marsala. Try
  to make sure that your liquids and seasonings have compatible flavors.
  
  Other suggestions:  The possibilities here are endless
  :)
  
  Oriental:  Burger mix with a little soy sauce in the liquid and some fresh
  ginger added to the mix, maybe a dash of rice wine.
  
  Spanish:  Cumin, red pepper, chili powder, or a dry taco seasoning mix.
  
  Indian:  Curry powder added to the mix.
  
  Wine/garlic:  Chopped garlic added to the mix, half water and half white
  wine for the liquid.
  
  Potpourri:  Make a batch of plain, unseasoned burger mix and add whatever
  seasonings strike your fancy as you're mixing it up!  No need to commit to
  just one flavor for the whole batch!

      Title: TOFU POTATO SALAD WITH DILL
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      5 lg Potatoes
    1/2 ts Salt
     10 oz Soft (MoriNu) lite tofu
      2    To 3 cloves garlic, minced
           Water for steaming
      4 tb Fresh dill weed (or 1-1/2
        tb Dried dill)
      2    To 3 Tbs. brown rice
           Vinegar
           Or lemon juice
           Water if needed for
           Blending
      2 ts Low-sodium tamari
      4    Stalks celery, minced
      2 ts Prepared mustard
    1/2 c  Minced fresh parsley
 
  Slightly adapted from the Vegetarian Times
  
  Bake, boil, microwave, or pressure cook potatoes until tender. Run under
  cold water to remove skins.  Chill.
  
  Meanwhile, steam tofu for 10 minutes.  While tofu is cooking, place rice
  vinegar (lemon juice), oil (if desired), tamari, mustard, salt and garlic
  in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth.
  
  Drain tofu, crumble and add to blender or food processor along with dill.
  Blend until smooth and creamy.  You may need to add a few tablespoons of
  water (up to 1/4 cup) depending on how soft the tofu is and how well your
  blender purees.  You will want it a little "loose" and liquidy, as the
  potatoes will absorb some of the moisture.
  
  Chop chilled potatoes into 1-inch cubes and place in a large mixing bowl.
  Pour tofu mixture on top of potatoes and mix, evenly coating potatoes. Stir
  in celery and parsley.  Be careful not to mash potatoes as you mix. Makes 6
  side-dish servings.

      Title: LENTIL AND LEEK RISOTTO [T]
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4    Chopped leeks (green and
           White parts, well washed)
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
      1    Red pepper, finely chopped
      3 c  Vegetable broth or water
  1 1/4 c  Brown rice
        x  Salt and pepper to taste
      1 tb Approx. chopped fresh basil
           Or a pinch dried basil
      1 c  Cooked lentils
    1/4 c  Freshly chopped parsley
    1/4 c  Finely grated carrots
 
  In a 4 quart deep pot with cover, saute leeks, garlic and red pepper in a
  small amount of the broth.  When soft, add the rest of the broth or water,
  and stir in rice along with seasonings. Reduce heat and simmer covered for
  about 40 minutes or until rice is done. Uncover, stir in cooked lentils and
  reheat until lentils are hot. Garnish with parsley and grated carrot before
  serving.
  
  *I deleted 1T of olive oil for sauteing, so the nutritional information of
  368 total calories and 6g of fat is off by whatever 1T olive oil accounts
  for.
   I also changed 1 clove garlic to 4, and 2 leeks to 4. It was too mild for
  me in it's original incarnation. I also liked it better with basmati brown
  rice, though the dish then became a pseudorisotto in texture.
  
  Delicious and easy if you keep cooked lentils around!

  Heat 1 cup of water for each cup of mix until boiling add seasonings <see
  below> add to dry mixture and stir until liquid is absorbed.  Drop by large
  spoonsfull into nonstick fry pan <or use pam>  it will firm up as it cooks.

  pleases you.
  
  For a more tender pancake like burger use a little more water.
  
  beef, chicken, or ham flavored burgers.  Use 2 TBS <more or less to taste>
  soup starter for each cup of water.  Serve on buns with lettuce tomatoe,
  onion, ketchup, mustard or whatever strikes your fancy.  For cheeseburgers
  use FF cheese.
  
  Taco burgers add 1/2 pkt taco seasonings to each cup of water. serve with
  salsa or stir fry to a chunky consistancy and make tacos
  
  hawaiian burgers use pineapple juice in place of 1/2 the water add a dash
  of soy sauce. Serve with pineapple rings.

      Title: VLF BURGERS
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Short grain brown rice
           (measure uncooked)
    1/2 c  Onion (finely diced)
    2/3 c  Carrot (minced or grated)
    1/2 ts Dry basil
    1/2 ts Dry thyme
    1/2 ts Black pepper (coarse grind)
    1/4 c  Tamari
 
  Cook the rice so that it comes out a bit dry (if it is very sticky and damp
  let it dry some by spreading it on a tray for a while.) After the rice
  cools, add all other ingredients, mix well, and sort of knead the mixture a
  bit until it feels a bit sticky. Form into patties about 4 inches round and
  about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick (don't make them to thin). Place on a
  nonstick baking sheet, and put into a preheated 450 degree oven. Let cook
  for about 25 minutes, flip and cook for another 10 to 15 minutes. If the
  mixture was too wet the burgers will kind of flow and get thin. When you
  are making the patties you will probably think that this can't be done. My
  family loves these with onion tomato and coarse mustard. Thanks to a kind
  person at the local Wellspring Grocery and Deli who was kind enough to
  share a recipe with their customers.

      Title: PEPPERS STUFFED WITH TOFU AND RICE
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Onion, chopped fine
      1    Rib of celery, chopped fine
    1/2 c  Mushrooms, chopped fine
           (optional)
      1 c  Brown rice, cooked
      1 c  Mixed vegetables, canned,
           Frozen, or chopped fresh
           Then boiled or
           Nuked
      1 c  Tofu
        x  Freshly ground black pepper
      4    6 green bell peppers
           (capsicum)
      2 cn Campbells tomato soup
 
  All measurements are approximate! If making your own mixed veg I suggest
  carrot, potato, corn, and peas. Cut the carrot and potato small, to about
  the size of the peas and corn. Microwave until tender.
  
  Saute onion, celery and mushrooms in lots of vegetable stock until soft.
  Mix equal amounts of cooked rice, mixed veg. and tofu in bowl. Add cooked
  onion mixture and freshly ground black pepper to bowl.
  
  Slice the top off of the peppers and reserve. Remove the seed from the
  peppers then add peppers to boiling water. Boil very briefly, about 2 - 4
  minutes. Remove from pot and rinse with cold water. Arrange peppers in
  baking dish. Fill each with tofu mixture. (Extra stuffing can be frozen).
  Pour tomato soup over the peppers. Replace cap over each pepper (or
  sprinkle with low fat cheese). Put lid on baking dish and bake at 180
  degrees Celsius or 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 45 minutes.

      Title: LENTIL AND CORN SOUP
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 md Onion, chopped
      2 md Carrots, sliced
      2 tb Water, stock, or sherry for
           Sauteing
      7 c  Water
    3/4 c  Dried lentils
      2 md Tomatoes
      1 c  Fresh or frozen corn
      1 sm Sweet potato, diced
      4 ts Tamari or soy sauce
      1 c  Cooked brown rice
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley (I
           Double this amount)
 
  Corn and sweet potatoes give this soup a nice sweetness. It's adapted from
  Mark Bricklin's _Lose Weight Naturally Cookbook_ (Rodale), which uses too
  much meat and dairy for our purposes; this one, however, adapts well by
  substituting for the oil in the saute. It also freezes and microwaves well
  for brown-bag lunches.
  
  Saute the onion and carrots in a large saucepan over low heat, stirring
  occasionally, until the onions are translucent.
  
  Add water, lentils, tomatoes, corn, and sweet potato. Bring to a boil,
  reduce heat, cover and simmer for 25 min. Add the tamari, rice and parsley,
  and heat through before serving.

      Title: VEGANBURGERS
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 c  Brown rice
  2 1/2 c  Rolled oats
     12 oz Ordinary white mushrooms
        x  Large handful of dried
           Shiitake mushrooms
      3 md Onions
      2    Bay leaves
      1 tb Sage
      1 tb Basil
      1 tb Thyme
      3 tb Cornstarch + just enough
           Water to make a smooth
           Paste
      3 tb Dark soy sauce
 
  cook brown rice as you would normally cook brown rice, and allow to cool.
  
  simmer onions and herbs in water until onions are soft.  remove bay leaves.
  save any broth.
  
  soak shiitake mushrooms in water until they soften.  simmer *all* mushrooms
  in mushroom water until the fresh mushrooms are cooked through.  save
  mushroom sweat.
  
  in a food processor, process 1/2 of the rice, 2 c. of the oats, and all of
  the other ingredients until there are no big chunks.  You may have to do
  two batches depending on the size of your food processor.  Use mushroom
  water and onion liquid to keep the food processor happy.
  
  in a large bowl, mix the processed gloop with remaining rice and oats.  It
  should be thick enough to form into cohesive patties, but not dry.  Add a
  few extra oats if it's too wet, or some liquid if your hands don't get a
  little sticky when handling it.
  
  fry in a light spray of Pam, over low heat, until both sides of the patty
  are brown and crunchy.  about 10 min.
  
  using a larger amount of mushrooms makes it taste even better, but then the
  batter becomes more like thick pancake batter.  Still yummy though.

      Title: HIDDEN VEGETABLE SOUP
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 5 servings
 
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      2 sm Carrots, chopped
      2    Celery stalks, chopped
      1    Green or red pepper,
           Chopped
    1/2    Head green cabbage chopped
      1    Or more cloves garlic
     28 oz Can chopped or crushed
           Tomatoes
      2 c  Tomato or tomato-vegetable
           Juice (more or less)
      1 c  Salsa
      1 c  Raw brown rice, mostly
           Cooked (you can use
           Leftover)
        x  Herbs and pepper to taste--I
           Usually use oregano and
           Basil
        x  Supermarket grade Balsamic
           Vinegar
 
  Puree the onion, carrots, celery, green pepper, cabbage, and garlic (not
  all at once!) in a blender, using as much tomato juice as necessary to aid
  the process.  Combine with tomatoes, salsa and herbs, and cook about 15 or
  20 minutes.  If the rice is partially cooked, add it with everything else;
  if fully cooked, add near the end of cooking. If the soup is too thick for
  your taste, add tomato juice or water. Just before serving, stir in a
  little balsamic vinegar.
  
  I serve this as a main dish, along with bread.  Probably makes about 5 or 6
  servings.

      Title: RICE AND LENTIL SALAD
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Wild rice
      1 c  Long grain brown rice
      1 c  Green (French) lentils

--------------------------------COMBINE WITH--------------------------------
      1 ea Red, yellow, green bell
           Pepper, chopped
      2 c  Small cherry tomatoes
      1    Or 2 carrots
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh basil (more or
           Less)
      1    To 2 tablespoon or chopped
           Fresh mint

----------------------------------DRESSING----------------------------------
        x  Nonfat tomato-herb
        x  Red wine vinegar
 
  Cook grains separately, in 2 cups water, until done, 45 minutes or less.
  
  For the dressing, I used a prepared nonfat tomato-herb dressing (Trader
  Joe's) mixed about half and half with red wine vinegar because I generally
  find prepared nonfat dressings too thick and too sweet for my taste. I
  didn't measure, but I used perhaps half a cup, maybe as much as a cup,
  total, just enough to moisten everything.
  
  I let it sit in the refrigerator all day, to let the flavors mix. I don't
  know how many people it served--it filled a large bowl-- but there wasn't
  any left over after the potluck (and while I was glad that everyone liked
  it, I was sorry not to have some to take home).

      Title: ELEGANT STUFFED PUMPKIN
 Categories: Vegetables, Oct.
      Yield: 5 servings
 
      1    5-pound pumpkin
      2    To 3 cups brown rice,
           Cooked
      2 c  Crumbled dry whole wheat
           Bread (or part corn bread
           Etc ) I used bread
           Crumbs and corn meal.
      1    Onion, chopped
    1/2    To 1 cup chopped celery and
           Leaves
      2    Apples (tart and unpeeled),
           Chopped
      1 c  Roasted chestnuts or a
           Andful of cashew nuts, cut
           In half.
        x  Herbs: Sage, savory,
           Marjoram, oregano, and
           Paprika to taste. I used
           About a teaspoon
           Each
      1    To 2 cups vegetable stock
    1/4    To 1/2 cup butter, melted,
           Or safflower oil.
           [ed ...Necessary?]
           Soy sauce or salt to taste.
 
  Cut off top of pumpkin to make a lid. Remove the seeds and scrape out any
  stringy pulp. Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl and mix well
  with hands. Add stock and butter, and mix well, adding soy sauce and salt
  if desired. Stuffing should be moist but not wet. Pack loosely into
  pumpkin, replace lid, and bake on oiled cookie sheet for 1 1/2 hours or
  more at 325 F. It is done when a fork pushes easily through the pumpkin.
  Transfer to a caserloe dish and serve at the table, scooping out some of
  the tender pumpkin flesh with each serving of stuffing. If the pumpkin is
  organically grown, you may eat the skin too. (If you have too much stuffing
  for your pumpkin, place extra in an oiled casserole, cover, and bake for 1
  hour.)

 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 tb Sherry (or water or stock)
      1 md Onion, chopped
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
      1 c  Chopped up mushrooms (make
           1/4 to 1/2" pieces)
           -- optional
      1 md Carrot, chopped
      1 sm (~1 lb) eggplant, peeled and
           Cubed
      1 c  Lentils
      1 c  Texmati brown rice (or
           Shortgrain)
      1    8 or 10 oz can tomato sauce
      2 c  Vegie stock
      2 c  Water
      1 ts Dried basil
      1 ts Dried oregano
      2 ts Chopped parsley to taste or
           More (up to 1/3 cup)
 
  Rice Cooker: Put the sherry or stock into the rice cooker with the sherry
  or stock, and turn on the machine. Let the onion saute, as you chop and add
  the garlic, mushrooms, carrot, and eggplant. Give the pot a quick stir as
  you add each vegie. Add water if the vegetables start to stick, Let the
  eggplant cook about a minute or so, then add the lentils, rice, liquids,
  basil, and oregano. Cover, let it cook, and allow to stand about 10 minutes
  when the cooker shuts off. Stir in the parsley and serve.
  
  Slow Cooker: Saute the vegies lightly, then add everything but parsley to
  the crockpot. Cook on low if you want to ignore it all day, or 3-4 hours on
  high. Add parsley and serve.
  
  Stovetop: Saute the vegies, add everything but the parsley, cover and bring
  to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 40-45 minutes, or until liquid is
  absorbed. Stir in parsley.

      Title: POTATO AND RICE BURGERS
 Categories: Digest, Oct., Lacto
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Plain non fat yogurt
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
    1/4 ts Soy sauce
    1/8 ts Crushed red pepper
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
      1    Clove garlic, minced
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley

----------------------------------BURGERS----------------------------------
      1 lg Potato, peeled and diced
      1 c  Cooked brown rice
    1/4 c  Dry whole wheat bread
           Crumbs
      3 tb Parmesan cheese (or
           Substitute)
    1/2    Onion minced
      1    To 2 tsp. tamari or soy
           Sauce
      2 tb Chopped parsley
 
  In a bowl, combine sauce ingredients.  Place in refrigerator to chill.
  Prepare grill or griddle.  Boil potato in water over medium heat until
  tender, about 10 min.  Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients in a medium
  bowl.  Drain potato and mash with a fork or masher.  Add potato to bowl,
  mix well and form into 4 thin patties. If potato mixture is too dry to hold
  together, add a little water before making patties.  Grill patties 4 to 5
  min. on each side until lightly browned.  Serve on hamburger buns with
  sauce and your choice of fixings.
  
  I don't have a grill so I broiled mine instead and they turned out great!
  Brown and crispy!  These have a nice taste.

      Title: BROWN RICE & WHEAT BERRIES (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  2 1/4 c  Water
    1/3 c  Wheat berries
    1/3 c  Brown rice
      1 tb Saute fluid (pick your a
           Compatible favoriet)
    1/4 c  Chopped scallion
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
 
  In 2qt pan, boil water. Add berries, return to boil.
  Reduce heat, simmer, covered, 1 hour. Stir in brown
  rice. Cover, simmer 50 minutes longer. 5 minutes
  before rice is finished, saute scallion until
  softened. Combi ne with rice and wheat mixture, along
  with spices.
  
  Note: The original recipe called for 2 Tbs. pignoli
  (pine nuts), tosted in 1 Tbs butter, before adding the
  scallions. I simply eliminated them. I'll run both
  combinations through my recipe program, and re-post if
  it can be done <= 10% cff. The original recipe's
  'Health Tip' suggested omitting salt, substituting
  unsalted margarine, and/or eliminating the nuts.

      Title: SPANISH RICE (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 c  Uncooked brown rice
      2 c  Water
      1 tb Wine Vinegar
           Water
      4    Cloves garlic
      4    Stalks celery
      1    Green pepper
      1    Carrot
      1    Bay leaf
      1 sm Can stewed tomatoes
      1 ts Dry oregano
      1 ts Dry basil
    1/4 ts Cumin
           Fresh cilantro
 
  Put the brown rice on to cook.  Put vinegar and water
  in a heavy skillet and cook garlic, celery and green
  pepper (all chopped). Add enough water to the skillet
  to steam the carrot, add chopped carrot and bay leaf
  and cover skillet.  When carrot is soft, add stewed
  tomatoes, oregano, basil and cumin.  By now the rice
  should be done. Add the brown rice, lower flame and
  simmer for 15 minutes. Garnish with fresh cilantro and
  eat. Yum Yum Yum!
  
  I hope you like it!
  
  Also, just wanted to note, I started this program just
  before travelling home from Christmas at my parents'
  house.  I stopped at a restaurant with a salad bar,
  got veggie soup, salade and a plain baked potato on
  the side. They had fruit on the salad bar too, so I
  could have had that for dessert, but I didn't have any
  room left in the tum.

 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      7 oz Brown rice
      1    Onion, chopped fine
      1    Clove garlic, chopped fine
      1 ts Rosemary
    1/3 oz Dried mushrooms, soaked
           (bolets) - get something
           Exotic &
           Flavorful
    7/8 c  Vegetable broth
    7/8 c  Merlot or other red wine
      2 oz Grated ff Parmesan (or
           Sapsago, if you can find
           It)
           Salt, pepper
 
  1. Cook the rice for 15 minutes in 1 3/4 cups of water.
  
  2. Squeeze out the mushrooms and chop them. Saute the onion and garlic in
  your favorite liquid, add the rosemary and mushrooms, and boil rapidly. Add
  the rice and bring to a boil.
  
  3. Add the broth and wine, and cook for 10 minutes over a low flame. (Note
  ~ at this point I had much too much liquid, so I let it cook with the top
  off until enough had boiled away.)
  
  4. Season to taste with salt and pepper, add the parmesan, and serve
  promptly.
  
  (the original advises eating promptly so it doesn't get too dry; I didn't
  find this to be a problem, and even reheated it for a couple of days).

      Title: ELAINE'S DOLMAS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Mcdougall, Main dish
      Yield: 48 servings
 
     48    Grape leaves (about 1 jar)
    1/2 c  Long grain brown rice;cooked
      2 c  Onion; finely chopped
      2 tb Parsley; finely chopped
      2 tb Mint leaves; finely chopped
      2 ts Dill weed
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
    1/4 c  Currants
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      1 c  Tofu TVP (optional)
 
   Place grape leves briefly in a pan of warm water to separate them, then
  drain on paper towels. Combine all other ingredients. Place grape leaf vein
  side up, with the stem toward you. Put a mound of rice mixture in the
  middle of the leaf (about 1 rounded tsp to 1 rounded tbsp, depending on the
  size of the leaf). Fold over sides and roll up leaf. Layer the rolled
  leaves in a large saucepan (3 quart) placing them side by side and close
  together. Press with a heavy heat proof plate that fits inside the pan. Add
  enough boiling water to cover leaves. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.
  
   Hints: Dolmas may be served warm or chilled. If warm, try serving them
  with lemon sauce. If cold, serve them with garbanzo puree or eggplant.
  Tabouli is also a good dish to serve at the same meal. Dolmas are easy to
  take to a potluck dinner and they also make a very special "company meal."
  Recipe for making tofu TVP follows. The use of the tofu in this recipe is
  entirely optional; they are delicious both ways.

      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Ground cumin

      (I would probably use a little wine, Bragg's
      Amino, and/or some veggie broth instead of the
      water for sauteing.) 4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
   5. Spread 1 cup of Enchilada sauce over the bottom of
      a casserole dish.
   6. Spread a line of the spinach-rice mixtue down the
      center of a tortilla.
   7. Roll up and place, seam-side down, in the
      casserole.
   8. Repeat until all of the ingredients are used.
   9. Pour the remaining sauce over the tortillas. 10. Cover and bake for 30
  minutes.
      (Anyone NOT following the McDougall Plan, could
      top this off with some
      no-fat cheddar cheese and/or serve with a bit of
      no-fat sour cream.

      Title: VEGETABLE-BEAN SOUP
 Categories: Beans, Soups, Potatoes, Mcdougall
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 c  Kidney beans; dried
      2    Garlic cloves; pressed
      1    Onion; chopped
      2    Potato; cut in chunks
      1    Carrot; sliced 1/2" thick
      2    Zucchini; sliced 1" thick
    1/4 lb Green beans
      2    Leek
    1/4 lb Cabbage
           (savoy is best)
    1/3 c  Brown rice, long-grain; * se
      3    Tomato; cut in wedges
    1/4 c  Parsley sprigs; chopped
    1/4 ts Celery seed
    1/4 ts Marjoram
      1 ts Basil
      1 ts Oregano
 
  Recipe by: McDougall Place beans in pot with 2 quarts of water. Bring to
  boil, remove from heat and let rest 1 hour. Then add chopped onion, garlic,
  and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Chop potatoes in large chunks; do not peel. Slice carrots 1/2 inch and
  zucchini 1 inch thick, scrub them, do not peel. Slice leeks and cut beans
  into 1 inch pieces. Add to soup pot along with seasonings. Simmer for 1
  hour longer.
  
  Thinly slice cabbage and add to soup along with rice or spaghetti. Simmer
  another 20 minutes. Add more water if too thick. Add tomato wedges for the
  last 10 minutes, just before serving.
  
  HELPFUL HINTS: Kidney beans make a good rich broth, but any kind of bean
  also may be used. Soup freezes well, so make a large batch when you have
  time and freeze half for use on a budy day. Try using some chopped spinach,
  instead of the cabbage. By changing the vegetables and beans used, the soup
  can be different each time you make it. It is a meal in itself.

      4 oz Peanuts -=OR=- cashews
 
  Cook the onion & garlic in the olive oil until soft & golden.  Stir
  in the rice until coated evenly with the oil.  Add the stock, salt &
  turmeric. Bring to a boil & simmer for about 40 minutes.  The rice
  should be tender & all the liquid absorbed.
  
  While the rice is cooking, prepare the vegetables.  Cut the beans into
  small chunks.  Cook in boiling salted water until tender (I'd prefer
  to steam them).  Drain well.
  
  Cool the rice & vegetables & mix together with the bell pepper.  Stir
  in half the nuts & place in a serving bowl.  Sprinkle with the
  remaining nuts.  Serve with an oil & vinegar dressing if liked.

  uncooked bulghur - start 1 cup lentils cooking - dice and brown 1 large
  onion in some huge amount of olive oil (I used less than the 6 Tbs called
  for, which cuts down on the taste) - after 30 minutes of the lentils
  cooking, toss in the rice (drained) or bulghur, the onion, 1 tsp cumin
  [I've used twice as much and added some coriander as well], and some pepper
  and salt. simmer another 15 minutes - brown (caramellize) another diced
  onion - add the onion to the top of the lentil/grain mixture; let sit 10
  minutes
  
  The dish has a good consistency. I've made this twice in the past week from

      Title: VEGGIE BURGER MIX
 Categories: Vegetables, August
      Yield: 12 servings
 
    1/2 c  Dry garbanzo beans
    1/2 c  Dry soybeans
    1/2 c  Dry lentils
    1/2 c  Yellow split peas
    1/2 c  Instant brown rice
    1/2 c  Rolled oats
      1 pk Dry soup mix or
           Salad dressing mix
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
 
  Put the ingredients one by one in a blender.  Turn on the blender.  Run for
  cover (it's pretty noisy).  When everything is reduced to powder, combine i
  a container.  To use, mix 1 cup of the mix with 2/3 cup HOT water or
  combination of water and BBQ sauce, water and wine, or whatever other liqui
  you can think of. Let sit 15 minutes, then form into 3 patties. Cook in a
  pan coated with nonstick spray. NOTE: If you use BBQ sauce as part of the
  liquid, they wi brown much faster - must be the sugar in the sauce. This
  recipe makes 4 cu of dry mix.
  
   The variations for this are endless, as you can use different dry mixes.
  Good Seasons makes fat free dry salad dressing mixes, and there are lots of
  different flavors of soup mix (I think onion soup would be good).  You coul
  also use the dry seasoning mixes, like the taco seasoning, etc. Some of the
  are fairly high in sodium, but I would think that in a quantity of mix, it
  would average out to an acceptable level.

      1    Carrot, sliced about 1/4"
           Thick
      1 md Zucchini, sliced about 1/4"
           Thick
    1/2    Head broccoli, cut into

           Sliced 1/4" thick
      1 cn Sliced water chestnuts
    1/2 lb Extra firm tofu, drained and
           Cut into 1/2" cubes
        x  Anything else that seems
           Like a good idea at the
           Time
      1 tb Mellow brown rice miso
           Paste
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 ts Fresh ginger, minced
    1/8 ts Chinese 5-spice mix
      2 ts Soy sauce
      1 c  Warm water
      1 tb Cornstarch, dissolved in a
           Few tbs hot water
      1    Splash of sake or white wine
           Or dry sherry
      1    To 2 tbs peanut oil
 
  Dissolve the miso in the water.  Dissolve the cornstarch in a small amount
  of hot water and add to the miso, along with the soy sauce and 5-spice mix.
  Set aside.
  
  Heat the wok, then add the oil; heat for a minute and swirl around to coat
  the wok.  Add the garlic and ginger, stir around until the garlic starts to
  brown.  Add the mushrooms, toss for about 3 minutes until they start to
  soften.  Add the carrots, stir for about 2 minutes; then the broccoli,
  another minute; then the water chestnuts, another minute; then the tofu.
  Add a splash of sake, stir for another minute or two as the steam melds
  everything, then pour on the sauce.  Stir until it thickens (about 3
  minutes), then serve with rice or noodles.
  
  The portabellos have a chewey, firm body and a rather strong flavor, very
  nice!  I think next I'll try some kind of dish mixing whole caps with
  eggplant...I'll let you know in a week or so!
  
  as always, "eat! eat!"

           -strips)
      4    Chicken legs (2 1/2 pounds)
      1 lb Cajun-style sausage
      3 md Garlic cloves, peeled
      1 md Onion, peeled, cubed
      1 md Green bell pepper, cored,
           -cut in 1-inch squares
      2 md Tomatoes, peeled, cored,

           Powder, ground black pepper
    1/4 ts Each, cayenne pepper,
           -ground cumin
      3 c  Chicken broth
           Salt
    1/2 lb Peeled, deveined raw shrimp
 
  I seem to remember you being involved in a conversation about brown
  rice a few months back...  Here's something that you might find
  interesting.
  
  Put ham or bacon in a 4-quart soup kettle and cook over low heat
  until fat is rendered.  Increase heat to medium and stir until
  cooked, about 5 minutes.
  
  Remove chicken skin, cut meat off the bones and then cut boneless
  chicken into bite-size pieces.  Add to kettle or skillet with bacon
  or ham and toss until color turns pale, about 4 minutes.  Remove
  bacon or ham and chicken with a slotted spoon and put on paper
  toweling; set aside. Add sausage to kettle and brown all over, about
  6 to 8 minutes; remove. Leave 2 tablespoons fat in kettle; pour off
  and discard remaining fat.
  
  Insert metal blade in food processor.  Mince garlic by adding to
  machine with motor on.  Add onion and chop very coarsely with half
  second pulses. Add green pepper and process with half-second pulses
  until mixture is chopped to medium consistency.  Add mixture to
  kettle and stir over low heat until softened, about 10 minutes.
  Process tomatoes until pureed; set aside.
  
  Add rice to ingredients in kettle and stir over low heat for 2
  minutes. Then stir in oregano Thyme, file, black pepper, cayenne
  pepper and cumin. Add tomatoes and broth.  Stir well and let mixture
  to boiling. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook rice mixture 15 to 20
  minutes. Cut sausage into 1/4-inch thick coin like slices.  Mix
  sausage, ham and chicken pieces into rice.  Cover and cook until rice
  is tender (rice may not absorb all the liquid) about 20 minutes
  longer.  Taste and adjust seasoning, adding salt as needed.  Stir
  shrimp into hot rice mixture, cover pot and let stand for 8 to 10
  minutes.  Serve rice with shrimp, meats and liquid.
  
  Serves 8.

 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/3 ea Brown rice
    1/3 ea Barley
    1/3 ea Millet
 
  I was bored with rice, so I mixed 1/3 brown rice, 1/3 barley, and 1/3
  millet.  Rinsed well, then put it in the microwave for ten minutes on high,
  and let it stand for a few hours.  (I just put it in a big plastic bowl,
  and I didn't measure the water.)  It was yummy underneath chili, beans, and
  spaghetti sauce.  (3 different meals.)

      Yield: 4 nice folks
 
      2 lg Onion; peeled
      2 cl Garlic; crushed
      2    Inch piece gingerroot; fresh
           -peeled
      2 tb Curry powder;
      1 ts Turmeric;
      4 tb Natural yogurt;
           Salt to taste
           Fresh gournd pepper to taste
      6    Green Cardamoms;
      1    Cinnamon stick;
      2 c  Brown basmati rice; L-grain
           -If basmati is not available
           -=OR=-
      2 c  Ordinary brown rice;
  3 1/4 c  Water
           Lemon Wedges; to serve
           Fresh coriander; to serve
 
  Thinly slice 1 onion and set it aside.  Cut the other onion into
  chunks, then puree it to a paste with the garlic, gingerroot, curry
  powder, turmeric and yogurt.  If you do not have a blender or food
  processor, then grate the onion and gingerroot and mix with the other
  ingrededients.  Add plenty of seasoning, then spoon this mixture over
  the chicken thighs, spreading it evenly over them and turning to coat
  all sides.  Cover and chill for 1-24 hours, the longer the better.
  Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan or flameproof
  casserole. Add the sliced onion, bay leaves and cardamoms, then cook,
  stirring often, until browned-about 20 minutes.  Use a slotted spoon
  to remove half the onion from the pan and reserve for garnih.  Push
  the rest of the onion to one side.
  Add chicken portions, reserving the juices from marinating and brown
  them all over.  Add the rice to the pan, sprinkling it down between
  the chicken.  Tuck the cinnamon stick in between the chicken, then
  scrape all the marinating juice into the pan.  Pour in 3 3/4 cups of
  water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover pan tightly.
  Leave to gently for 30-35 minutes, until the rice has absorbed the
  water and the chicken is tender.  The biriani should be moist.
  Transfer the birmani to a serving dish, or serve it from the cooking
  pan, sprinkling the reserved onion over and addin flavor.  Add lemon
  wedges for garnish-their juice should be squeezed over before the
  birani is eaten.

           Bay leaves

           Lemon wedges
           Sprigs of mint

---------------------------------CHERMOULLA---------------------------------
      4 sm Garlic cloves, minced
      1 ts Ground cumin seeds
    1/2 ts Sweet Hungarian paprika
    1/8 ts Cayenne
      1 pn [generous] saffron
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
    1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
    3/4 c  Olive oil
           Salt
           Black pepper
 
    This is a very colorful and tasty arrangement of
  marinated and then skewered and grilled vegetables and
  fish. The marinade, called chermoulla, is a blend of
  fragrant seasonings, oil, and lemon juice. In this
  version I've suggested my favorite vegetables for
  kebabs. You should choose your own favorites; some
  other good choices are eggplants, mushrooms, and
  onions. special equipment: skewers (if you are using
  bamboo skewers, soak them in water for 1/2 hr. and
  fill them out to the ends so the skewers won't burn)
  
  Combine the ingredients for the chermoulla.  Cut the
  fish into 1-inch cubes.  Similarily, cut the
  vegetables into 1-inch cubes. Place the fish and
  vegetables in the chermoulla and marinate,
  refrigerated, for 2 hours.
    When you are ready to assemble the kebab, soften the
  bay leaves in boiling water for several minutes.
  Alternate the tomatoes, peppers, yellow squash, and
  fish on skewers. Place a bay leaf occasionally on the
  skewers next to the fish.  Reserve the chermoulla.
    Cover the broiler pan with foil and plkace the
  kebabs on it about an inch apart.  Broil for 15 to 20
  minutes, basting with the reserved chermoulla, and
  turning frequently to cook evenly.
    Serve on rice or in pita bread and garnish with
  lemon wedges and sprigs of mint. From Sundays at

  fat from body and neck cavities. Reserve necks and giblets. Loosen
  skin from the breast meat of each pheasant with your fingers, With
  knife, cut peel or rind and all membrane off 1 orange; cut peeled
  orange crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Reserve peel.
  
  2. Place half of the orange slices on breast meat under the skin of
  each bird. Tuck wing tips under back to hold neck skin down. Place 1
  carrot quarter, 1 onion quarter, and half of the orange peel inside
  each body cavity. Using kitchen string, tie the legs of each pheasant
  together.
  
  3. In 2-quart saucepan, melt butter; remove from heat. Place
  pheasants, breast sides up, on rack in a large roasting pan. Brush
  birds all over with melted butter. Set aside pan with any leftover

  * (use white if you prefer, but since it doesn't take as long to cook,
  you may want to cook the vegetables a bit before adding the rice.)
  
  Put rice and liquid in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add curry,
  pepper flakes, carrots, celery, leek, kale and mushrooms.  Return to a
  boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 35-40 minutes, or until most of

 Categories: Info
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           --- ENOUGH SMOKE FOR 4 ----
           ---- CHICKEN BREAST ------
      2 tb Raw brown rice
      1 tb Brown sugar
      4    Whole cloves
           Tea leaves from 2 earl Grey
           - tea bags, removed from
           - packets
    1/4 ts Olive oil
      2    6oz boneless skinless
           - chicken breasts
 
  Take 3 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil 15 inches square and start
  rolling the edges under to from a circle that fits in the bottom of your
  Dutch oven -- in our case, a foil saucer approximately 5 inches in
  diamerter.  When the edge is rolled to about 1 inch high, stop and flatten
  it. Then, depress the center to hold the smoke ingredients.
  
  In the depression of the aluminum foil saucer first sprinkle the rice, then
  the sugar, cloves and the contents of the tea bags. The order of
  ingredients is very important. Place the foil dish in Dutch oven, cover
  tightly and cook over high heat until ingredients in the foil start smoking
  ~- about 5 minutes.
  
  Brush a steamer platform with the olive oil.  Place the chicken on
  platform, skinned side up.  Put into Dutch oven over the smoke ingredients,
  cover and continue smoking over high heat until done -- about 11 minutes.

      Title: BEAN & RICE BURRITOS
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 cn Pinto beans, 16 oz waterpak
      1 c  Brown rice; cooked
    1/2 c  Onions; frozen, chopped
    1/2 c  Gr. peppers; frozen, chopped
    1/2 c  Corn; frozen
           Chili powder; dash
           Cumin; dash
           Garlic powder; dash
    3/4 c  Water
           Salsa, oil-free, low sodium
     10    Tortillas, whole wheat

-----------------------------OPTIONAL TOPPINGS-----------------------------
           Lettuce, chopped
      1 bn Scallions; chopped
      1    Tomato; chopped
 
  Saute the frozen onions and green peppers in a few tablespoons of water in
  a skillet.  Drain and rinse the beans and place in a skillet and mash with
  a potato masher. Add the cooked rice, corn, spices and water. Heat 5 to 10
  minutes until most of water is absorbed, stirring occasionally.
  
  Heat the tortillas quickly (just to soften) in a preheated skillet, a
  toaster oven, or a microwave. Place a line of bean mixture down the middle
  of each tortilla, add a teaspoon of salsa and any of the other toppings as
  desired.  Fold up 1/2 inch on each side, tuck in the top edge and roll into
  a burrito.  Serve immediately, topped with additional salsa if desired.
  
  The leftover bean mixture can be kept in the refrigerator and reheated in
  the microwave prior to assembly.
  
  The bean mixture can be adapted by changing the kind of beans (try kidney
  beans) or omitting the corn, or adding your favorite ingredient. I got more
  servings out of the recipe than the book got out of the original recipe, so
  I guess I put less mixture on each tortilla.

      Title: BEAN BURRITO CASSEROLE
 Categories: None
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     12    Tortillas; * see note
      3 c  Pinto beans, canned; rinsed
      2 c  Brown rice, cooked
      1 c  Green onions; chopped
           Enchilada sauce:
      2 c  Tomato sauce; ** see note
      3 c  Water
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 ts Onion powder
      3 tb Chili powder
      4 tb Cornstarch; *** see note
 
  Preparation Time: 2:07 This may be made without the brown rice; use 5 cups
  mashed cooked and drained beans instead. The sauce can also be used in
  other Mexican recipes.
  
  To make the enchilada sauce combine all ingredients in a saucepan and cook,
  stirring constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, about 7 minutes.
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the enchilada sauce in the
  bottom of a covered casserole dish. Take one tortilla at a time and spread
  some beans, rice, and scallons down the center. Roll up and place
  seam-side-down in the casserole dish. Repeat until all ingredients are
  used. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the rolled-up tortillas,
  cover, and bake for 30 minutes.

      Title: BLACK BEAN STEW
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 c  Brown rice
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Cooked black beans,
           -reserving some of the
           -cooking liquid
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      2    Cloves crushed garlic
    1/2 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Ginger
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 ts Red pepper (optional)
    1/4 c  Cheap red wine (optional)
      1    Vegetarian sausage link,
           -crumbled (optional)
           Salt and pepper
      4 oz Shredded sharp
           -cheddar cheese
 
  Prepare the rice in the water according to package directions or your own
  procedure (white rice is OK, but it makes for a bland and fairly gummy
  dish).
  
  While the rice is cooking, combine all the rest of the ingredients except
  the cheese in a saucepan and simmer, at least 15 minutes.
  
  Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spoon the cooked rice into a casserole dish.
  Remove the bay leaf from the bean mixture; pour the beans over the rice and
  stir; it doesn't have to be thoroughly mixed. Top with the cheese and bake
  uncovered 20-35 minutes or until cheese is browned and bubbly. Let stand
  five minutes before serving.
  
  I tell people this serves four, but that's a fairly skimpy serving. It
  doubles easily, but you'll need a pretty good-size casserole. Also, the
  wine is optional for those who don't use it, but it really does make a
  difference, and since the other flavors are pretty assertive, I'd suggest
  using a fairly cheap, strongly flavored wine. Posted By Teresa Lauren Marx

      Title: CHESTNUT & RICE SAVOURY
 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegan
      Yield: 1 serving
 
      1 sm Onion
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 sm Tomato
      1 c  Mushrooms
    1/2 c  Brown rice, cooked
      2 oz Dried chestnuts
      2 tb Water
      1 ts Yeast extract
      1 ts Tomato paste
 
  Cover the chestnuts with boiling water and leave them to soak for several
  hours, then cook them until tender.  (If the chestnuts are soaked in warm
  water in a wide-rimmed thermos flask, or in a warm cupboard, them may be
  tender enough not to require more cooking.)
  
  Chop the onion and saute it in the oil in a saucepan for about 3 minutes.
  
  Skin and chop the tomato.  Slice the mushrooms.  Add them to the pan and
  cook for a further 3 minutes or so.
  
  Add the rice and chestnuts to the pan and stir well.  Then add the water,
  yeast extract and tomato paste.  Mix together very thoroughly as it heats
  up so that the yeast extract is amalgamated evenly into the mixture.
  Continue cooking over a gentle heat until all the ingredients are well
  heated.

  RINSE THE RICE, cover it with water and set it aside to soak while you
  prepare the rest of the vegetables. Preheat the oven to 375F. Warm the oil
  and butter in a large skillet. Add the eggplant and onion, salt them
  lightly, and rapidly saute them to distribute the oil. Cook over medium
  heat until the eggplant is soft but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Add the
  peppers, tomatoes, spices (including the pepper), parsley and more salt to
  taste. Stir carefully, combining everything well. Drain the rice and add it
  to the pan along with 3 cups water. Turn up the heat to bring the water to
  a boil, then transfer everything to a baking dish, such as a large,
  earthenware gratin dish. Lay a piece of parchment over the top, cover with
  foil, and bake until the rice is done, about 45 minutes. Toss the diced
  cheese, if you're using it, into the rice and serve. Serves 4 as a main
  course or 6 to 8 as a side dish.

      Title: KAI'S UNFRIED RICE
 Categories: Low fat, Rice
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 c  Uncooked brown rice
      1    Green pepper, chopped
      1    Red, yellow or orange pepper
           Chopped ( I use all
           Sometimes)
      2    Packs of Dried Shitake
           Mushrooms or 2 packs of
           Fresh
      1 lg Onion thinly sliced
      1 bn Scallions
           Garlic - fresh or dried (to
           Taste)
           Ginger - fresh or dried (to
           Taste)
           Lite teryaki sauce
           Lite soy sauce
           Rice wine
      1 pk Fried Rice Seasoning
           (mccormick or la choy.....)
 
  Marinate Mushrooms: Cut mushrooms into thin strips and add appx. 1/4 cup of
  Rice wine, teryaki, garlic and ginger  Let stand 1 hour to overnight.
  
  Cook rice in rice cooker.
  
  Heat non-stick skillet till very hot. Throw in veggies and more diced fresh
  garlic, ginger and pepper.   (High heat with NO oil brings out flavors in
  veggies, according to Chef Prudhomme)
  
  Stir quickly, as they begin to become tender add rice wine a little at a
  time, just to prevent sticking/burning, not enough to make the veggies
  soggy.
  
  Throw the cooked rice from the rice cooker into a big bowl, throw in the
  veggies, toss around.
  
  Add chopped scallions (uncooked, the heat from the other stuff is enough).
  
  Toss about to evenly distribute ingredients.
  
  Add the Fried Rice Seasoning Packet,  Toss and serve.

      Title: LENTIL & CORN SOUP
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 md Onion, chopped
      2 md Carrots, sliced
      2 tb Water, stock, or sherry for
           Sauteing
      7 c  Water
    3/4 c  Dried lentils
      2 md Tomatoes
      1 c  Fresh or frozen corn
      1 sm Sweet potato, diced
      4 ts Tamari or soy sauce
      1 c  Cooked brown rice
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley (I
           Double this amount)
 
  Corn and sweet potatoes give this soup a nice sweetness. It's adapted from
  Mark Bricklin's _Lose Weight Naturally Cookbook_ (Rodale), which uses too
  much meat and dairy for our purposes; this one, however, adapts well by
  substituting for the oil in the saute. It also freezes and microwaves well

      Title: LENTIL & LEEK RISOTTO [T]
 Categories: None
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4    Chopped leeks (green and
           White parts, well washed)
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
      1    Red pepper, finely chopped

           Or a pinch dried basil
      1 c  Cooked lentils
    1/4 c  Freshly chopped parsley
    1/4 c  Finely grated carrots
 
  In a 4 quart deep pot with cover, saute leeks, garlic and red pepper in a
  small amount of the broth.  When soft, add the rest of the broth or water,
  and stir in rice along with seasonings. Reduce heat and simmer covered for
  about 40 minutes or until rice is done. Uncover, stir in cooked lentils and
  reheat until lentils are hot. Garnish with parsley and grated carrot before
  serving.
  
  *I deleted 1T of olive oil for sauteing, so the nutritional information of
  368 total calories and 6g of fat is off by whatever 1T olive oil accounts
  for.
   I also changed 1 clove garlic to 4, and 2 leeks to 4. It was too mild for
  me in it's original incarnation. I also liked it better with basmati brown
  rice, though the dish then became a pseudorisotto in texture.
  
  Delicious and easy if you keep cooked lentils around!

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Onion, chopped fine
      1    Rib of celery, chopped fine
    1/2 c  Mushrooms, chopped fine
           (optional)
      1 c  Brown rice, cooked
      1 c  Mixed vegetables, canned,
           Frozen, or chopped fresh
           Then boiled or
           Nuked
      1 c  Tofu
        x  Freshly ground black pepper
      4    6 green bell peppers
           (capsicum)
      2 cn Campbells tomato soup
 
  All measurements are approximate! If making your own mixed veg I suggest
  carrot, potato, corn, and peas. Cut the carrot and potato small, to about
  the size of the peas and corn. Microwave until tender.
  
  Saute onion, celery and mushrooms in lots of vegetable stock until soft.
  Mix equal amounts of cooked rice, mixed veg. and tofu in bowl. Add cooked
  onion mixture and freshly ground black pepper to bowl.
  
  Slice the top off of the peppers and reserve. Remove the seed from the
  peppers then add peppers to boiling water. Boil very briefly, about 2 ~ 4
  minutes. Remove from pot and rinse with cold water. Arrange peppers in
  baking dish. Fill each with tofu mixture. (Extra stuffing can be frozen).
  Pour tomato soup over the peppers. Replace cap over each pepper (or
  sprinkle with low fat cheese). Put lid on baking dish and bake at 180
  degrees Celsius or 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 45 minutes.

    1/4 ts Soy sauce
    1/8 ts Crushed red pepper
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
      1    Clove garlic, minced
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley

----------------------------------BURGERS----------------------------------
      1 lg Potato, peeled and diced
      1 c  Cooked brown rice
    1/4 c  Dry whole wheat bread
           Crumbs
      3 tb Parmesan cheese (or
           Substitute)
    1/2    Onion minced
      1    To 2 tsp. tamari or soy
           Sauce
      2 tb Chopped parsley
 
  In a bowl, combine sauce ingredients.  Place in refrigerator to chill.
  Prepare grill or griddle.  Boil potato in water over medium heat until
  tender, about 10 min.  Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients in a medium
  bowl.  Drain potato and mash with a fork or masher.  Add potato to bowl,
  mix well and form into 4 thin patties. If potato mixture is too dry to hold
  together, add a little water before making patties. Grill patties 4 to 5
  min. on each side until lightly browned. Serve on hamburger buns with sauce
  and your choice of fixings.
  
  I don't have a grill so I broiled mine instead and they turned out great!
  Brown and crispy!  These have a nice taste.

      Title: RICE & LENTIL SALAD
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Wild rice
      1 c  Long grain brown rice
      1 c  Green (French) lentils

--------------------------------COMBINE WITH--------------------------------
      1    Red, yellow, green bell
           Pepper, chopped
      2 c  Small cherry tomatoes
      1    Or 2 carrots
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh basil (more or
           Less)
      1    To 2 tablespoon or chopped
           Fresh mint

----------------------------------DRESSING----------------------------------
        x  Nonfat tomato-herb
        x  Red wine vinegar
 
  Cook grains separately, in 2 cups water, until done, 45 minutes or less.
  
  For the dressing, I used a prepared nonfat tomato-herb dressing (Trader
  Joe's) mixed about half and half with red wine vinegar because I generally
  find prepared nonfat dressings too thick and too sweet for my taste. I
  didn't measure, but I used perhaps half a cup, maybe as much as a cup,
  total, just enough to moisten everything.
  
  I let it sit in the refrigerator all day, to let the flavors mix. I don't
  know how many people it served--it filled a large bowl-- but there wasn't
  any left over after the potluck (and while I was glad that everyone liked
  it, I was sorry not to have some to take home).

      Title: TURKEY & CHILE SOUP
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     16 oz Can of tomatoes
      7 oz Can of diced green chiles
      1    Onion, cut into chunks
      3 c  Chicken broth or
           -homemade turkey stock
      3 c  Bite-size pieces of
           -cooked turkey
      2 c  Cooked brown rice
     10 oz Pk frozen whole kernel corn
    3/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Garlic salt
    1/4 ts Chili powder
 
  This is a recipe that I like to use for turkey leftovers.  I use the
  carcass to make the stock first.  I throw in any vegetables I want to use
  up in the fridge into the stock pot except cabbage and broccoli and carrot
  greens which smell too strong if I let the stock boil too hard by accident.
  After straining the stock and discarding the bones and vegetables I use the
  following recipe from the Sunset "Fresh Ways with Chicken" cookbook, which
  I usually double.  I also use more broth and less turkey than they call
  for, I really don't measure the ingredients, I just add what I've got until
  it's as thick as I want it and the proportions look right.
  
  In a blender or food processor combine tomatoes and their liquid, chiles
  and onion; whirl until smooth.  Pour into a large pan, add broth and bring
  to a boil over high heat.  Add turkey, rice, corn, garlic and spices.
  Reduce heat and simmer until heated through.
  
  Serve with fresh cilantro, sour cream and tortilla strips, their recipe
  calls for strips made from flour tortillas, but I use corn tortilla chips
  sometimes.  -- Sandra Chaffin (fnsjc@aurora.alaska.edu)

      Title: TWO-DAY CHILI
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Black beans, soaked starting
           In the early a.m.
      1 c  Brown rice (med. grain)
     28 oz Can diced tomatoes with
           Sauce
      2    To 3 med./lg. onions,
           Chopped
      3 lg Carrots, diced
      1    Garlic cloves to taste,
           Chopped
      1    Chili powder to taste
      1    Cumin to taste
 
  Cook brown rice and soaked beans in water to cover in crockpot set to high
  (overnight).  In the morning, add saute'd veggies, canned tomatoes and
  spices. Continue cooking on high (watch the water level) until dinner for
  flavors to blend.  Serve over rice/potatoes/tortillas, etc.
  
  I made some black bean chili last week (black beans, canned tomatoes,
  saute'd onions and carrots, spices) - from scratch - a crockpot full. And
  added a "secret ingredient" - brown rice, which I added when I started to
  cook the (presoaked) beans - overnight at high in the crockpot. All my SAD
  friends who ate it thought it was *great*, and that it contained m**t
  (actually, no added f*t, no added m**t - just what was in the rice, etc ;-)

      Title: BLACK BEAN PATTIES
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Cooked black beans
      1 c  Cornmeal
      1 tb Cumin
      1 c  Cooked brown rice
      1 c  Soymilk
 
  The North  American Indians made patties  of black beans and cornmeal,
  cooking  them over campfires.  Brown  rice has been added to give them more
  substance, though the Native Americans on the plains would have used wild
  rice.  For a main dish,  you can make or buy a mushroom gravy to serve over
  the  patties, serving with a green vegetable and salad. Uncooked patties
  can be wrapped in wax paper and frozen, then for a quick meal you can
  defrost and fry or grill. This is a nice way to use up leftover rice or
  beans, but you can also cook some for the occasion. For breakfast, you can
  serve with warm maple syrup.
  
  Cool the  beans and rice,  if you have  just cooked them. Combine all the
  ingredients well.  Add more cornmeal  as needed to form a stiff dough. Form
  into  patties.  Add corn oil to a frying pan and fry, or grill over
  charcoal. Cooking black beans: put 1 cup dry black beans in 3 cups water
  and store  overnight (a  quart canning  jar works  well for this.) Bring to
  a  boil  in  fresh  water  and simmer around 40 minutes. Cooking brown
  rice: place 1 cup  brown rice in 2 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, then
  cover  and simmer  until water has disappeared, about 35 minutes. Let the
  rice rest with cover on an additional 10 minutes. From: Mary Howard.

      2 c  Soy milk
      4 c  Bread crumbs
      2 c  Walnuts, chopped

    1/2 ts Paprika
      2 ea Dash pepper
    1/2 ts Salt (optional)
      6 ts Egg replacer
      4 tb Water
 
  Prepare rice (begin with 7/8 cup brown and 1/8 cup wild, uncooked and add
  to 2 cups boiling water). I just used my rice cooker and cold water and it
  turned out great. Make cashew milk using 1/2 cup cashews blended with 1/2
  cup water. Dissolve egg replacer in 2 Tbsp water.
  
  Place all ingredients into large bowl and mix together well.  Press firmly
  into nonstick loaf pan and bake at 350 degree oven for 1 hour.
  
  Place serving plate on top and turn over letting loaf drop out onto plate.
  Serve with mushroom gravy, entered separately.
  
  Helpful Hints:  Makes a great stuffing.  Also can be served as "sloppy Joe"
  covered with marinara
  
  The Holiday Loaf is really delicous, but I would most definately consider
  this a rich, feast day type of food. That is why I only serve in on
  Thanksgiving.

      Title: VEGETARIAN EGG ROLLS
 Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 pk Egg roll wrappers
           Or
      1    *recipe of cheese blintz pan
           Sesame oil
      1 c  Celery, finely chopped
      1    Onion, small, finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 c  Cabbage, finely shredded
      1 c  Mushroom, finely chopped
      1    Green pepper, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Water chestnuts, finely chop
      1 c  Sprouts, bean or seed, fresh
    1/4 c  Soybeans, dry cooked and
           -pureed
      3 tb Soy sauce
  2 1/2 c  Brown rice, cooked
 
  These egg rolls make an excellent first course, or when eaten right with
  the cooked rice, a whole meal.  Just be sure, if you eat them without rice,
  that you include rice in the meal to complement the soybeans.
  
  In a wok or frying pan saute the vegetables in sesame oil in the order
  given.  After the onion has started sauteing, add the remaining vegetables
  quickly so that the total time with the heat on is about 5 minutes. As soon
  as you add the bean sprouts to the pan, turn off the heat.
  
  Stir the pureed soybeans and soy sauce together.  Then stir this mixture
  into the vegetables.
  
  The whole mixture may be chilled several hours, or used warm. To prepare
  the rolls: place about 1/4 cup filling in the center of each pancake or egg
  roll wrapper; fold the corners over envelope-style and seal with a
  flour-water paste.
  
  Heat a large frying pan with oil in the bottom.  Fry the rolls until they
  are crisp and brown, turning only once.  You may deep fry the rolls if you
  are into deep frying, but they are better cooked only in a little oil.
  Drain on paper bags or towels.
  
  Keep the rolls hot in a 250~ oven up to an hour.  Or reheat them at 450~
  for about 10 minutes.
  
  Serve 2 egg rolls with about 1 cup of cooked rice and any of the following:
  mustard, horseradish, soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce, or hot sauce.

      1 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Thyme
    1/4 ts Cloves
    1/4 ts Celery seed
      4 tb Tamari
    1/2 c  Tomato paste
      2 c  Brown rice; cooked
    1/2 c  Nuts; chopped
     16 oz Tomatoes, canned; with their
           -juice
     10 oz Sauerkraut
 
   Cut the core out of the cabbage and discard it.Place the cabbage, stem end
  down, in a large kettle. Place about 1 inchof water in the bottom of the
  ketle. Cover and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and
  steam the cabbage for about 10 minutes.
  
   Remove the cabbage and let it cool for easier handling. Save the remaining
  water for use in soups or stews, if desired.
  
   While the cabbage cools, drop the crumbled tofu into the 6-8 cups boiling
  water. Bring the water back to a boil andlet the tofu cook for 1 minute.
  Drain the tofu through a colander lined with a clean dishtowel. Run cold
  water over the tofu to cool it off for easier handling. Twist the towel
  containing the tofu and pres sit to squeeze out the excess water. The
  pressed tofu should have a firm, ground-beef-like texture. Set the tofu
  aside while you prepare the remaining ingredients.

  spices. Saute until the onions begin to get tender. Add the pressed tofu to
  the sasuteed vegetables and stir over medium heat for a couple of minutes.
  Add the tamari, tomato paste, rice, and nuts.
   Mix well and remove from heat.
  
   Carefully peel the leaves away from the steamed cabbage. Inside each of
  teh larger leaves, palce one small leaf. Cut away the thick, tough part of
  the leaves.
  
   Drop one heaping tablespoon of the tofu-rice filling into the center of
  each small leaf. Fold both the top and the bottom of the large leaf over
  the filling, then fold the two sides over the seam. Palce the cabbage rolls
  seam side down on your table or countertop.
  
   Mix together the tomatoes and sauerkraut and place half of the mixture in
  the bottom of a large, shallow baking dish or in two 7- x 11-inch baking
  dishes. Set the cabbage rolls seam side down on top of the
  tomato-sauerkraut mixture over the cabbage rolls.
  
   Cover the baking dish(es) with aluminum foil and bake at 350 deg for 45-60
  minuts, oruntil the cabbage is tender. Uncover the cabbage rolls during the
  last 10 minutes of baking.
