   1      tablespoon    instant coffee granules -- optional
   2      teaspoons     pure vanilla extract

TO MAKE CHEESECAKE TOPPING:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly oil an 8-by-11 1/2-inch baking pan or coat it with nonstick cooking spray. Dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Set aside.

2. With an electric mixer, beat cream cheese at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Beat in sugar and vanilla until very smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in egg, followed by egg white; beat 2 to 3 minutes to thoroughly blend. Add 1 tablespoon flour and, with the mixer on low speed, beat just until blended. Set aside.

TO MAKE BROWNIE BATTER:

1. In a small bowl, whisk flour, cocoa and salt. In a large bowl, beat brown sugar, oil, buttermilk, egg, egg whites, coffee granules, if using, and vanilla on high speed until smooth, making sure no lumps of brown sugar remain. Add the dry ingredients and beat on low speed just until blended.

2. Set aside 1/2 cup of the brownie batter. Transfer the remaining brownie batter to the prepared pan, spreading it into the comers and smoothing the surface. Carefully pour the reserved cheesecake topping onto the batter and spread it evenly to the edges. Dot the cheesecake layer with the remaining brownie batter. Without disturbing the brownie layer, swirl the cheesecake layer with a table knife.

3. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, just until the top is set Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack before cutting. Makes 16 cheesecake brownies.

3. Sift the flours, baking powder and salt together into the sugar/egg mixture; mix on low speed until just combined. Divide the dough in half and press each piece into a disk. (The recipe can be made ahead to this point. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Return to room temperature before rolling out.)

4. Working with one disk at a time, roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut out cookies with small (about 2- to 2 1/2-inch) cookie cutters. Place the cookies about 1/2 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.

5. Bake in the upper third of the oven, 1 sheet at a time, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until slightly golden on the edges. Do not overbake. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool. (Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days or freeze for longer storage.)

Makes about 2 1/2 dozen cookies.
