      Title: SPRINGTIME ASPARAGUS SALAD
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Asparagus, peeled *
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  White wine vinegar
    1/2 ts Dijon mustard
      1 lg Clove garlic, crushed
           Salt and ground pepper
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
        ds Tabasco sauce
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
      3 tb Pine nuts,toasted(see below)
 
  1.  Steam the asparagus spears for 5 minutes.  Drain well and place
  in a serving dish.
  
  2.  In a bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, Dijon, garlic, salt,
  pepper, Worcestershire, Tabasco, onion, parsley, and Parmesan. Stir
  in the pine nuts.
  
  3.  Pour the vinaigrette over the asparagus.  Cover and let marinate
  in the refrigerator 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Serve chilled with the
  marinade spooned over the spears.
  
        6    portions
  
  * I always peel asparagus, as the stalk can be quite tough,
  especially on mature asparagus.  If you purchase the pencil thin
  asparagus, it is not necessary to peel them, as they are generally
  quite tender.
  
  HOW TO TOAST NUTS
  
  Spread nuts out on a cookie sheet and bake in a 350F degree oven for
  5 to 10 minutes until golden. Different sizes and types of nuts toast
  at varying times; the smaller the nut, the faster it browns, so you
  have to keep a watchful eye on the oven.

           Orange Butter Cream,
           Recipe Follows
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped pistachio
           Nuts
      1 pt Perfect whole strawberries,
           Hulled
 
  Wash and cut up l pint hulled strawberries into a flat dish. Mash
  with a fork until well broken up. You should have about l cup mashed
  strawberries. Set aside 1/4 cup and bring rest to a boil in a small
  saucepan. Thoroughly combine cornstarch and 1/4 cup sugar and
  gradually stir into boiling berries. Stir just until clear and
  slightly thickened, then remove from heat. Add a little red food
  coloring if desired. Stir in half the Cointreau and let stand at room
  temperature until needed for filling. Combine icing sugar, butter,
  vanilla and enough of the 1/4 cup strawberry pur‚e to make an icing
  that is easy to spread. Beat until fluffy and set aside. Heat red
  currant jelly and remaining Cointreau over lowest heat until jelly
  melts. Keep just barely warm until needed. Split cake layers to make
  4 thin layers. Put first layer on a serving plate. Spread with half
  of Orange Butter Cream. Top with second layer and spread with
  strawberry filling. Top with third layer and spread with remaining
  butter cream. Top with last layer. Chill for about l0 min. if butter
  cream seems very soft. Set aside about 1/2 cup strawberry icing and
  thinly ice sides of cake with part of remainder. Press pistachios
  into icing. Turn a 5-inch plate or saucer upside down in centre of
  top layer and ice all around it with rest of strawberry icing. This
  will make a nice, even iced edge about 2 inches wide. Lift plate or
  saucer with tip of knife and remove. Fill un-iced centre of the cake
  with the whole strawberries. Spoon some of the melted currant jelly
  over each berry, letting it run down to cover the berry and fill the
  spaces around it. Put the 1/2 cup icing in a decorating bag or tube
  with a rosette tip and pipe small rosettes all around strawberry
  centre to cover joint between icing and glazed berries. Chill until
  shortly before serving time.Serves 12.

      Title: SPROUTED RYE CAKES
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 40 Servings
 
      2 c  Sprouted rye
    1/4 ts Anise seeds, crushed with a
           Rolling pin
    1/4 ts Salt
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
      1 c  Flour
 
  "Chewy and quite zesty, these flavorful Sprouted Rye Cakes are
  excellent with cold corned beef or pastrami. 300~F. 35 to 40 minutes
  Preheat the oven to 300~F.
  
  Drain the sprouted rye very well. Finely chop it in the food
  processor, blender, or by hand. (If you are using the blender, chop
  the rye about 1/3 cup at a time.) Add the anise seeds and salt and
  mix well. Blend in the egg.
  
  Mix in enough flour to form a dough that will hold together in a
  cohesive ball. The amount of flour needed will depend on how dry the
  sprouts were after draining. This dough is very sticky, and you will
  want to keep your fingers well-floured for the next operation.
  
  Using two spoons, divide the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in
  diameter. Place each ball on a lightly greased or parchment-lined
  baking sheet. Mash the balls into flat circles with the well-floured
  palm of your hand or the floured side of a glass.
  
  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, turning once after about 20 minutes, when
  the bottoms have browned. Yield: 30-40.
  
  VARIATIONS: Try other sprouted grains, such as wheat or oats.

      Title: SPROUTED SEEDS
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Seeds to be sprouted
      1    Quart jar with holes in lid
      1 c  Tepid water
 
  Pour the water on the seeds and allow to soak for 2 to 4 hours. Pour
  the water off and let the jar sit in a slightly warm place. The top
  of the fridge works fine. Twice a day, add some tepid water to cover
  the seed, and allow to soak for a few minutes.  Again, pour off the
  excess water. Bright light will develop the green of the chlorophyll,
  if you wish. Harvest when you feel like using them. Years ago, I
  bought a three pack of plastic lids that had three different mesh
  sizes. If I were to look for them again, I'd try a natural food
  store, which is also a good place to find material for sprouting.
  
  Things to Sprout: Alfalfa, fenugreek, mung bean, radish, lots more.
  This is a good way to improve your winter salads with fresh produce.

      Title: SPUMONI GOURMET
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5    Egg yolks
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 c  Milk
      1    Piece vanilla bean
      1 c  Heavy cream
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Chopped marachino cherries
      1 tb Shredded candied orange peel
      1 tb Slivered blanched almonds
 
  In a saucepan beat 5 egg yolks and 3/4 cup sugar until the mixture is
  thick and pale in color.  Stir in 2 cups milk, add a 1-inch piece of
  vanilla bean, and cook over very low heat, stirring constantly, until
  the custard is thick.  Be careful not to let it boil. Discard the
  vanilla bean and cool the custard.  Turn it into a refrigerator tray
  and freeze it for about 2 hours, or until it is firm, but soft enough
  to be molded easily.
  
  Whip 1 cup heavy cream until it is stiff, fold in 1/4 cup sugar and 1
  tablespoon each of chopped marachino cherries, shredded candied orange
  peel, and slivered blanched almonds and chill the mixture.
  
  Chill a 1-quart jelly or spumoni mold and line the inside of the mold
  with the frozen custard.  Fill the center of the mold with the
  chilled whipped cream mixture, cover the top of the mold with wax
  paper, and freeze the spumoni without stirring.

      Title: SQUARE SPRING ROLL (RAM GOI)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Raw shrimp, shelled and
           -deveined
           Black pepper
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
      2    Scallions, both white and
           -green parts
    1/2 lb Pork butt
      1 ts Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      1    Clove garlic
      1 tb Vegetable oil
     10    Dried rice papers (banh
           -trang)
 
  For dieters or the cholesterol conscious++an oven baked version of
  spring rolls.  In Vietnam these are often baked over charcoal. Cut
  the shrimp into small pieces and sprinkle with the black pepper and
  the sugar. Slice the scallions crosswise into very thin slices. Slice
  the pork into thin pieces, 3 x 2 x 1/8 inch.
  
  Combine half the slice scallion with the shrimp and meat, the fish
  sauce and a dash of black pepper.
  
  Chop the garlic fine; place on a platter near the stove, along with
  the remaining scallions.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the garlic and remaining scallion briefly until
  they brown slightly.  Add the pork-shrimp mixture and keep stirring
  over high heat until cooked, about 5 minutes.
  
  Cut or break the 10 rice papers into quarters.  Place the cut rice
  papers on a flat surface.  Using a pastry brush, or your fingers,
  paint water over the entire surface of each of the pieces; this is to
  make the brittle papers become soft and flexible.  Try working an
  about 10 quarters at a time.  This will help you work faster. While
  some of the wrappers become pliable, you can be filling the others.
  
  Place 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 small pieces of pork on the pointed
  end of a paper, arranging the filling in a square shape. Bend the
  pointed end over the filling and roll twice, then fold the sides over
  and continue to roll into a 2-inch-long cylinder about 1 inch thick.
  Place on a tray, with the open end on the underside to prevent
  unrolling, while you fill the remaining rolls.  Place the rolls in
  the oven, directly on the oven rack, without preheating.  (They can
  be crowded together while baking so that you can get many onto 1
  rack.) Again, be certain to place them open end down; turn the oven
  to 350 degrees and bake them for about 40 minutes, 20 minutes on each
  side.
  
  NOTE:  These can be filled several hours before cooking, covered with
  a plastic wrap, and refrigerated. Or they can be baked and then kept
  at room temperature for several hours.  They never lose their
  crispness. Use bamboo chopsticks or tongs for turning the rolls.

  1 1/2 lb Peeled butternut squash
           Or pumpkin cut in 2 inch
           Cubes or about 2 cup cooked
           Canned or frozen squash
      4    Peeled sliced apples
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      2 c  Apple cider
      2 ts Salt or to taste
      1 ts White pepper to taste
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
           Pinch of ground cloves
      4 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
    1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese opt
           Heavy cream to thin to
           Desired consistency opt.
           Whipped cream for garnish
           Opt
           Allspice for garnish
 
  In a kettle, cook the onion and garlic in margarine until soft,
  stirring occasionally. Add the cubed squash, apples, walnuts, cider,
  salt, pepper, allspice, cinnamon, cloves and enough stock to cover.
  Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer, partially covered, 1 hour or
  until squash is tender. If using canned, frozen or already cooked and
  pureed squash, add to other ingredients, bring to a boil and simmer
  for 10 minutes - start with a small amount of stock and add more if
  needed. Garnish and serve. In batches, puree the bisque in a blender
  or food processor until very smooth. Return to a clean pot and add
  brown sugar and, if needed, more salt and pepper. If desired, add
  cheese and stir until smooth. To thin to desired consistency, where
  ripples disappear, add cream or more cider. To serve, reheat until
  piping hot, but do not boil. Serve garnished with dollops of whipped
  cream and/or a dash of allspice and more chopped walnuts. NOTE: To
  precook squash without peeling, cut in half, remove pulp and bake,
  cut side down, in a baking dish with enough water to cover the bottom

 Categories: My favorite, Holiday, Southern, Pot luck, Cassarole
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Yellow Squash
           Corn bread
      2 cn Cream of Chicken soup
      2 tb Butter/oleo
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      1 lg Bell pepper, chopped
    1/2 c  Celery, chopped
      4    Eggs (see directions)
      1 lb Velveeta (mexican)
           -(see directions)
           Salt & pepper, to taste
 
  I am sorry about the amounts...I haven't measured the ingredients, but
  after the first time you will have a better idea of how much to use.
  
  Make a 9" skillit of cornbread. let cool.  Take about 4-8 yellow
  squash (depending on size, about 2-3 lbs) and boil until soft. While
  the squash is cooking, put the cornbread in a bowl and cut with a
  butter knife (dull bladed dinner knife) until crumbly.  I know there
  are other ways to crumble it, but there really is a difference. Melt
  butter in skillit, saute veggies until soft, let cool.  Mix soup with
  eggs (I use between 3 and 6 eggs depending on how it looks). Add
  cooled veggies, stir well. Stir into cornbread. Add squash and
  "enough" of the water. Should be the consistancy of oatmeal. (lumpy &
  soupy at the same time) Stir in salt & pepper. Cut cheese into 1"
  cubes and stir in. People use between 1/2lb and 1 lb depending on how
  well they like cheese. I use the mild mexican, but others will prefer
  the hot.  Pour/slide into baking dish allowing at least 1-2" growing
  room. Bake at 350f until done, lightly brown, and not runny (from the
  eggs).  Allow to settle for 10-15 minutes.
  
  Note: I *hate* squash and I *hate* cornbread stuffing...but this is
  one of my favorite dishes.

    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Oil

  2 1/2 c  Winter squash, cooked &

      2 ts Oil
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts White pepper
      2 ea Jalapeno chiles, minced
           Salt, to taste
    1/3 c  Coconut, shredded
 
  PASTRY:  Combine all dry ingredients in a bowl.  Add oil & slowly
  drizzle in water until the dough forms a ball. Knead until very soft
  & pliable. Wrap in a damp towel & let rest for 2 hours or so.
  
  FILLING:  Heat oil in a skillet, add the pureed squash & saute,
  stirring frequently, for 15 minutes.  Stir in the remaining
  ingredients. REmove from heat & let cool.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE:  Divide dough into 12 equal balls.  Roll each ball into a
  circle, very thinly, & slice in half. Keep covered with a damp towel
  until ready to use, otherwise the pastry will dry out too much & you
  will not be able to use it.  Place a portion of filling on one half
  of the semi-circle. Dampen the edges with some water & seal. Set each
  samosa aside until ready to cook.
  
  TO COOK:  Either, preheat the oven to 350F, place samosas on an
  ungreased cookie sheet & bake for 20 minutes. Or, deep-fry for 7
  minutes or until browned. Drain on paper towels & serve immediately
  with good chutnies. Or let go cold & freeze.  Reheat in a 350F oven.
  
  NOTE:  Baked samosas have a harder & more crunchy pastry. Deep-fried
  & I find that they retain too much fat. Try whichever way you find
  you prefer.

      Title: SQUASH TORTELLONI IN ROASTED VEGETABLE BROTH
 Categories: Sides, Vegetables, Pasta, Soup/stews
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Roasted Vegetable Broth
           -(separate recipe)
    1/2 lg Or 1 small butternut or
           -Sweet Dumpling squash
           -(about 1/4 lb),
           -halved and seeded
  1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Fmely niinced shallots
      1 tb Fresh thyme leaves
      1 tb Maple syrup
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      3 lg Eggs
      3 lg Egg yolks (1 mixed with 1
           -tablespoon milk, for egg
           -wash)
           Fine semolina or polenta,
           -for dusting
           Thyme sprigs, for garnish
 
  1. Prepare broth. Heat oven to 450'. To make filling, roast squash,
  cut side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet, for 30 minutes.
  Remove from oven; when cool enough to handle, scoop out flesh and
  mash it.
  
  2. In a saute pan over low heat melt butter, add shallots and thyme.
  Saute for 2 to 3 minutes, then add mashed squash, syrup, and salt and
  pepper to taste; continue cooking for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and
  set aside.
  
  3. To make dough, place flour in a mound on a clean surface. Make a
  well and add the whole eggs, 2 yolks, 1 t salt, and 1 T water. Mix
  egg and water with a fork until most of the flour is incorporated.
  Form dough into a ball and knead until it is firm, smooth, and
  elastic, about 5 minutes.
  
  4. Divide dough into 4 pieces, shaping each piece into a flat round,
  and wrap in plastic to keep from drying.
  
  5. Dust both sides of 1 piece of dough with flour and feed it through
  a pasta maker on the widest setting. Fold into thirds; repeat 3 times.
  Continue feeding dough through machine without folding, dusting both
  sides lightly with flour each time, once on each setting, from widest
  to narrowest.
  
  6. Place sheet of pasta on a lightly floured surface and cut into
  3-by-3-inch squares with a pasta wheel or sharp knife. Lightly brush
  each square with egg wash. Place 1 t of filling in the center of each
  square; fold down the top point to form a triangle. Gently press
  edges to seal. Brush the point opposite the longest edge with egg
  wash; fold down the other points to the center and press together. As
  you complete each tortelloni, place it on a baking sheet lined with
  parchment and dusted with semolina. (Don't allow tortelloni to touch.)
  
  7. Repeat from step 5 with remaining dough until filling is used up.
  Dust tortelloni with semolina, cover with a towel, and refrigerate
  until ready to use.
  
  8. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt, and cook tortelloni
  until al dente, about 5 minutes.
  
  9. Place 6 tortelloni in each of 6 bowls; pour broth over them, and
  garnish with 2 thyme sprigs.

      1 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
      1 c  Cracker meal
           Oil
 
  This recipe is from Abalonetti's, an Italian seafood restaurant on
  Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey, Ca.  The specialty of the house is to
  fix squid so as to be indistinguishable from abalone. They do a fine
  job of it too!  I've gained many pounds from scarfing down their
  excellent squid. It's plain, simple, to the point and very, very
  good!!! Give this to those folks who say "Eeeauu, I HATE squid!".
  
  Combine milk, egg, salt and pepper.  Dip squid in mixture and roll in
  cracker meal.  Place squid in a single layer in hot oil in a 10-inch
  frying pan.  Fry at a moderate heat until lightly browned. Turn
  carefully. Cook the other side.  Drain on absorbent paper. Serve with
  lemon wedges.

  Berkeley.  1981.  ISBN 0-915572-61-3.
  
  TIP:  Do NOT overcook the squid.  By the time the breading is nice and
  golden, the squid should be done...

      Title: SQUID COOKING INFORMATION
 Categories: Info/tips, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  Squid isn't tough when correctly prepared.  Here are a few basic
  rules to keep in mind followed by squid recipes from all over the
  world. From the International Squid Cookbook...
  
  "When heated, squid protein becomes firm rapidly and then turns chewy
  until long cooking breaks down the muscle. Much of the squid's
  reputation as a tough food comes from lack of knowledge of this
  simple fact. Sautes should be cooked no longer than three minutes and
  stews no less than twenty minutes.  Squid cooked for less than twenty
  minutes or more than about three minutes probably will be tough. If
  you don't believe me, just try it.
  
  Squid absorbs water quickly from marinades and sauces. Thus it can be
  prepared rapidly and still acquire all the flavoring of its
  accompaniments. Marinades do help the flavor of squid, but only up to
  a point. Squid should never be marinated too long.  Half an hour is
  probably the optimum time. After that, the meat starts to soften and
  may even take on a bitter taste if lemon or vinegar is used.
  
  Squid, like any seafood, is fragile.  It should be refrigerated until
  just before use to keep it as fresh as possible.
  
  The dark ink of the squid is its means of defense.  It shoots it at
  intruders who venture too close, creating an obscuring cloud behind
  which the squid makes a quick getaway. The ink itself is a salty,
  black liquid which makes an excellent flavoring for sauces. It is,
  not surprisingly, water soluble.  Don't worry if you get ink on your
  hands or clothes. It washes right out."

      Title: SQUID IN ITS OWN INK (CHIPIRONES EN SU TINTA)
 Categories: Seafoods, Basque
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Small fresh whole
           Squid with ink sacs
      1    Onion, finely chopped
      1 cl Garlic, finely chopped
           Olive oil for frying
           Italian (flat) parsley,
           Chopped
           Bread crumbs
           Sauce:
      1    Onion, finely chopped
      1 cl Garlic, finely chopped
           Crust of bread
      2 tb Fish broth
           Ink from the sacs
      8 ts Tomato puree
 
  These squid are also called Tripiroiak and Jibiones in various parts
  of the Basque Country. In the rest of Spain, they are referred to as
  calamares. Take apart and clean the fresh squid, taking care to
  remove the ink sacs without breaking them. Set the ink sacs aside.
  Cut the tentacles into one inch chunks.
  
  Fry one onion and one garlic clove in olive oil. When the onion
  begins to take on color, add the chunks of squid tentacles and cook
  slowly while stirring in the oil. Add the chopped parsley and bread
  crumbs and stir until well thickened.
  
  Stuff the squid tails with this mixture, being careful not to
  overfill. Seal the openings with a toothpick. Fry the stuffed tails
  in a small amount of olive oil, turning gently, until golden in
  color. Meanwhile make the ink sauce.
  
  Ink Sauce:
  
  Brown the other onion and garlic clove in olive oil, and add a crust
  of bread. Place the fish broth in a small bowl. Place the reserved
  ink sacs in a fine sieve our the bowl and puncture carefully. Blend
  the ink and broth. Add this liquid to the onion and garlic and cook
  slowly. Add the tomato puree and continue to simmer for a short time.
  Run the mixture through a blender.
  
  Place the sauce in a large skillet, add the fried, stuffed squid and
  simmer for 15 minutes. Makes three to four servings. Walt

      Title: SQUID SAMBAL
 Categories: Indonesian, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      2 lb Squid, cut into rings
      1    Onion, chopped
    1/4 c  Almonds
      2    Fresh chiles, finely
           -chopped, or
      1 ts Cayenne
      1 ts Grated lemon peel
      1 ts Tamarind concentrate,
           -dissolved in
      2 tb Water, or

      1 tb Brown sugar
    1/4 ts Shrimp paste or *
      1 ts Dried, salted shrimp
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  * (known as shrimp sauce in China),
  
  This is probably the most exotic of these recipes.  No country of
  origin is given, but from the name and the process it must be
  Indonesian or Malaysian.
  
  This dish has several unusual ingredients for which there are adequate
  substitutes available.  In any case, all the exotic ingredients are
  available at Chinese grocery.
  
  In a food processor, purse the onion, almonds, chiles and shrimp
  paste.
  
  In a large, heavy frying pan or a wok, saute the spice paste in oil
  over low heat.  When it turns dark brown, add tamarind water, the
  lemon, lemon grass and sugar. Saute a minute more, then add the
  squid. Turn up the heat and cook for 3 minutes, adding water if
  necessary to keep the sauce from sticking.  Remove from heat and
  serve over rice.
  
  As a main course this dish serves 3; as a side dish, 6 or more.

      Title: SQUID SAUTE
 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Squid, cleaned and cut into
           -rings
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
      4 tb Butter or olive oil
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
           -(optional)
           Lemon wedges
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  The easiest and, many people think, the best way to prepare squid is
  to saute it.  The basic recipe and variations provided here do not
  begin to cover the many ways to saute squid. This dish takes 10
  minutes or less to make once you have cleaned the squid.
  
  If you are using garlic, saute it in 1 Tb of olive oil or butter in a
  heavy frying pan over low heat until it is lightly browned. Turn up
  to a medium-high flame. Add the rest of the oil, and when it is hot
  the squid, parsley, salt and pepper.  Saute for 3 minutes.
  
  Serve with lemon wedges and boiled or fried potatoes.
  
  VARIATIONS:
  
  1.  Add quartered, cooked artichoke hearts or coarsely sliced beets
  along with the squid.
  
  2.  Substitute 1 tsp of dried or fresh dill, or 2 Tbs of fresh basil
  for parsley.
  
  3.  Substitute 1 tsp cayenne for black pepper.

    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      2 c  Canned Italian tomatoes
      1    Lemon, quartered
 
  SQUID STUFFED WITH RICOTTA AND SPINACH
  
  Do not overstuff the squid or they may split while they cook. Rice and
  braised
  
  fennel go well with this dish.
  
  1.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Clean the squid and chop the
  tentacles finely. Set them aside.
  
  2.  Saute the onion and the garlic in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil
  and the butter until the onion is soft. Add the tentacles and cook
  for 2 minutes.
   Add
  
  the spinach and saute, stirring, until it has wilted. Drain off any
  extra liquid and cool the spinach.
  
  3.  In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, egg, parsley, and the
  cooled spinach
  
  mixture.  Mix thoroughly and season with salt, pepper, and hot pepper
  flakes.
  
  4.  Stuff the mixture loosely into the squid and close the openings
  securely with a toothpick.
  
  5.  Use the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a rectangular
  baking dish large enough to hold the squid comfortably in one layer.
  Arrange the squid in the dish and add the wine and tomatoes. Season
  with salt, pepper and more hot pepper flakes, if you wish.
  
  6.  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the squid is tender and the
  sauce has thickened. If there is too much sauce, raise the oven
  temperature and allow the liquid to reduce. If there is too little,
  add more white wine. Serve the squid with lemon quarters.

  The Story:
  
  It was an Irish monk who established the monastery of St. Gallen in
  AD 613 and the town developed around it. The ruling of the monastery
  had a great influence over the lives of the surrounding community,
  which did not gain its independence until the 14th Century. Although
  the townsfolk and countryfolk sometimes suffered under their monastic
  rulers, they also inherited certain advantages, one of which is shown
  in this recipe. This proves that it is not just a legend that monks
  enjoyed good food.
  
  The recipe:
  
  Cream the butter and sugar.
  
  Mix the almonds, cocoa, cinnamon, flour and baking powder together.
  
  Add the milk, beaten egg white and dry ingredients to the creamed
  butter mixture.
  
  Work these together quickly until a soft dough is formed, leaving the

      Title: STAINED GLASS CANDY
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  3 3/4 c  White sugar
  1 1/2 c  Lily white syrup (or Karo,
           -must be colorless)
      1 c  Water
           -food coloring
           -oil based flavorings (I
           -use Wilton's)
           -tin foil
     10 c  -icing sugar (can be used
           -over and over)
           -sharp pair of scissors
           -candy thermometer
 
  Mix the white sugar, white syrup, and water in a medium sized pot.
  Add the food coloring you want (green for spearmint, orange for
  orange) Bring to a boil, and boil until candy thermometer reaches
  300F degrees. (Can take up to 20 minutes)   Stir to mix all the
  ingredients, but once it starts to boil, do not touch. Pot must be
  big enough to allow for double, as it rises as it boils
  
  While the candy mixture is boiling, shape a large piece of tin foil by
  folding up the sides and ends. (I use the large foil about 3 feet
  long) to create a large cookie sheet type shape. Put the icing sugar
  on the foil to completely cover it, and bank up the sides with icing
  sugar.
  
  When the candy mixture has reached 300F, remove from heat. Let sit
  about 10 seconds and stir to cool slightly (heavy emphasis on
  SLIGHTLY) Then add about 1 to 1-1/2 tsp of the oil based flavorings
  depending on how strong you want the flavor. Stir until mixed (may
  boil a bit and DON'T stand over top of pot as flavor with escape in
  the air and up your nose!! 8-} ) Once flavoring is combined, pour
  mixture onto the icing sugar and use rubber spatula to scrape all
  mixture out of pot. Put pot,spatula and candy thermometer into
  sinkful of hot soapy water. If you allow it to harden you won't be
  saying nice things about me at all!! 8-} As candy is cooling, keep
  checking by trying to pull up the edges. Once it gets to the
  consistency that you can lift it a little, start cutting it FAST! I
  cut off a chunk and then cut it up into bite-sized pieces. The
  outside will cool first so you have to watch it.  If it hardens to
  quickly you will end up with a good size lollipop that you won't be
  able to cut. It will shatter like glass. Continue working your way
  around until all is cut. Then I take all the candy and put it in a
  strainer that is sitting over a bowl. Shake some of the excess icing
  sugar off candy and allow to cool thoroughly. Pack in airtight
  containers.  I find Zip-Loc Freezer bags pretty good. This recipe
  makes about 2 lbs candy. Once I have done all the flavors that I
  want, then I set up all the bags and put about 10 of each flavor into
  a smaller zip-loc and seal. They make great Christmas gifts for
  family and all the various people you give to....mailman, garbage
  man, paperboy, school teachers, your kids friends..etc. I figure if
  the kids have to help me cut, they get some to give to their
  friends.. Besides.. makes a good bribe to get them to help!!

      2 ts Baking powder
    500 g  Glace pineapple
    100 g  Glace pear
    100 g  Glace kiwi fruit
    100 g  Glace apple
    100    Glace apricot
    250    Glace cherries
    250 g  Sultanas
    250 g  Currants
      4    Eggs
    2/3 c  Brown sugar
    250 g  Halved blanched almonds

    250 g  Halved macadamia ants
    250    Halved Brazil nuts
    1/2 c  Grand Marnier or Cointreau.
 
  From the traditional to the (comparatively) new-fangled. Stained
  glass or bishopcakes, very popular in the US, are so called, one
  presumes, because they consist almost entirely of glace fruit and
  nuts, and the glace fruit has something of the translucency of a
  stained-glass church window.
  
  [This is news to me.  I've never heard either of the two terms
  applied to fruit cakes.  Other terms, maybe, but not those... S.C.]
  
  Butter a round 23 an cake tin and line with grease proof paper.
  
  Butter the grease proof.  Chop the glace fruits roughly. Sift
  together the flour and baking powder. Mix in all the fruits, together
  with the nuts. Put the mixture into the cake tin, wet hands and press
  mixture down firmly.
  
  Bake in a preheated 150C oven for 1 1/2 hours.  Take cake out of the
  oven and drizzle the Grand Marnier or Cointreau over the top. Leave
  the cake in the oven to cool to warm then wrap it, tin and all, in
  aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Remove from tin, peel away paper and store in airtight tin.

      1 sm Onion, cut in half
      2    Celery ribs; cut into 2 inch

           -seeded
      3    Garlic cloves; peeled
      1    Bouquet garni of 1 bay leaf,
           -3 sprigs fresh thyme, 3
           -sprigs fresh parsley, tied
           -in a piece of cheesecloth
    1/2 t  Ground cumin
    1/2 t  Dried oregano
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper to taste
 
    Soak the beans in a large heavy pot covered by at least 3 inches of
  water for at least 4 hours.
    Add the rest of the ingredients.  Bring to a boil over high heat.
  Skim off any foam.
    Reduce the heat and gently simmer the beans, uncovered, until
  tender, 1 to 1-1/4 hours.  Add water to keep beans submerged.
    Season with salt and pepper during last 10 minutes of cooking.
  Drain the beans and rinse with cold water. Remove and discard the
  vegetable and the bouquet garni.  Pour over cooked rice.
    The secret to keeping black beans black is to cook them in the
  water in which they've soaked.  Enjoy! From Culinary World Tour Page

      Yield: 1 Pie
 
    2/3 c  Plus 2 Tbsp shortening
           ---OR--- 2/3 cup lard
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      4 tb To 5 Tbsp cold water
 
  For Two-Crust 8-or-9" Pie:
  
  Mix together flour and salt.  Cut shortening into flour/salt mixture
  until particles are the size of small peas. Sprinkle in water, 1 Tbsp
  at a time, mixing with a fork until all flour is moistened and pastry
  almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 tsp additional water may be added
  if dough is still too dry).
  
  Divide pastry in half and shape each into flattened rounds on a
  lightly floured cloth-covered board.  Roll one round of pastry 2
  inches larger than your inverted pie plate using a floured rolling
  pin. Fold pastry into quarters; place in 1/4 of the pie plate. Unfold
  and ease into the plate, pressing firmly against bottom and sides.
  
  Turn desired filling into pastry-lined pie plate. Trim overhanging
  edge of pastry 1/2" from rim of plate. Roll the second round of
  pastry using the same method for the first round. Place over filling
  and unfold. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1" from rim of plate.
  Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal --
  flute either by hand or with a fork.  With a sharp knife, cut slits
  in the top pie crust to allow steam to escape.  Cover edge of crust
  with 2-to-3" wide strips of aluminum foil to prevent excessive
  browning; remove foil during last 15 minutes of baking. Bake as
  directed in pie recipe.
  
  For a One-Crust 8-or-9" Pie:
  
  Cut all ingredients by half, and use the same mixing and placement
  method as used for the first round of dough in the two-crust pie
  above. Trim overhanging dough to 1" from rim of plate. Fold and roll
  pastry under, even with the plate; flute by hand or with a fork. Fill
  and bake as directed in recipe.
  
  For a 8-or-9" Baked Pie Shell:
  
  Use the same instruction for ingredients, mixing, and placement for
  1-crust pie.  Instead of filling crust, use a fork to thoroughly
  prick the bottom and sides of pastry. Bake at 475 until lightly
  brown, about 8-10 minutes; cool.  Fill as desired.

      Title: STANDING RIB ROAST WITH HERBED CRUST
 Categories: Beef, Meats
      Yield: 6 To 8 serv.
 
      1    Standing rib roast (7-8 lbs)
           -(about 3 or 4 ribs)
    1/2 c  Fresh thyme leaves; chopped
           -(reserve stems)
      4    Garlic cloves; peeled and
           -cut into slivers
      1 tb Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  ;water
      2    To 3 tablespoons flour
           -optional
 
  Preheat oven to 475 degrees F.  Dry the roast thoroughly. Lightly
  score the fat, then rub the whole roast with the reserved thyme
  stems. Rub the face and underside of the roast with half of the
  garlic slivers. Rub the whole roast with the pepper and salt. Pierce
  the fat layer just enough to insert the remaining garlic slivers--do
  not pierce into the flesh. Pat and press the thyme leaves into the
  scored layer of fat. Place the roast bones down in a shallow roasting
  pan just large enough to hold it comfortably. Insert a meat
  thermometer in the top of the roast; make sure it is not touching
  bone.
  
  Roast for 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and
  roast until done to your liking: 125-130 degrees for rare, 140-150
  degrees for medium, and 160-165 degrees for well done. Count on
  cooking times approximately as follows:  For rare, cooking time is
  12-15 minutes per pound; medium, 15-18 per pound; well-done, 18-20
  minutes per pound.
  
  Remove the roast from the oven and place it on a carving board. Let it
  stand, loosely covered with aluminum foil, for 15 minutes before
  carving.
  
  Meanwhile, skim all but a few tablespoons of fat from the juices in
  the roasting pan.  Place the pan over medium heat; add 1/2 cup of the
  water and stir to deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits clinging to
  the bottom of the pan.  Add the remaining water.  This juice can be
  served with the roast. For a flour based gravy, stir in the optional
  flour until it browns before adding the 1/4 cup of water.
  
  To carve, place on a carving board or platter, and cut away the bones.
  Place the roast cut-side down on the board and carve into 1/2- to
  3/4-inch-thick slices. Serves 6 to 8. Source: San Francisco Chronicle,

  onion slices and bean sprouts. Ladle about 1 1/4 cups hot soup stock
  (this will cook the beef) to cover the noodles and beef, top with
  fresh coriander and green onions. Serve with squeeze of lime and

      Title: STARK MARY JANE
 Categories: Candies, Miscell, Spice
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 c  Water
      3 tb Molasses
      1    Egg white
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    1/4 c  Powdered sugar
           Cornstarch for dusting
 
  1.  Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan over medium
  heat. 2. Heat stirring, until the sugar begins to boil, then continue
  to cook, using a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. 3.
  When the sugar reaches 240F degrees, or the soft-ball stage, beat the
  egg white in a microwave-safe bowl until it is tiff and forms peaks.
  Divide the beaten egg white, and throw out half. (You only need 1/2
  egg white for this recipe, and it is easier to divide when beaten.)
  4. When the sugar reaches 265F degrees, or the hard-ball stage, stir
  in the molasses, then pour the mixture in thin streams into the egg
  white while beating with an electric mixer on low speed. 5. Beat for
  3 to 4 minutes and then pour half the mixture into a 9x9-inch greased
  pan and let it firm up in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes. 6.
  Combine the peanut butter and powdered sugar. 7. When the candy is
  firm, spread a thin layer of the peanut butter mixture on top. 8.
  Microwave the remaining candy mixture for 1 minute on high, or until
  it becomes soft again. 9. Pour the softened candy over the peanut
  butter layer. 10. When the candy is cool but still pliable, (about 20
  minutes later)  turn it out onto a surface dusted lightly with
  cornstarch. Use a  cornstarch-dusted rolling pin to roll the candy
  about 1/4-inch thick. 11. Use kitchen scissors or a sharp knife to
  cut the candy into 1 1/2 x 1/2-inch rectangles. Makes 30 candies.

      Title: STARTERS FOR BREAD I
 Categories: Breads, Sourdough
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -SOUR RYE STARTER
      2 c  Rye flour
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 sl Onion
 
  Mix the flour, water, yeast, and onion together in a wide-mouth quart
  jar. Cover with a cloth and put in a warm place for 3 or 4 days or
  until it is well fermented, frothy, and smells pleasantly sour.
  Remove the onion. Either use, or seal and refrigerate. Can be used as
  part of the sponge in all sour rye breads.
  
  SAN FRANCISCO STARTER 1 cup milk 1 cup unbleached or all-purpose flour
  
  Pour the milk in a glass jar or bowl and leave uncovered at room
  temperature for a day.  Measure in the flour, stir and leave
  uncovered in a warm place for two to five days, depending on how soon
  the bacteria begin the fermentation process.  If the mixture should
  dry out, stir in a little warm milk. When the starter is bubbly,
  frothy, and gives off a pleasantly sour aroma, it is ready. Either
  use at that time, or cover tightly and store in the refrigerator. A
  variation of this is to mix the milk and flour together in a 1-quart
  glass jar, and seal immediately with a rubber sealing ring and a
  substantial wire clamp. Allow the mixture to ferment for 5 days. Stir
  down each day (thereby letting the accumulated gas escape), and
  replace the lid.  This starter obviously relies on the bacteria in
  the milk.
  
  RAW POTATO STARTER 1 cup warm water 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1
  tsp EACH salt and sugar 1 medium potato, grated
  
  Mix together the water, flour, salt, and sugar in a 2-cup measure. Add
  graded potato sufficient to make a full 2 cups. Pour the mixture into
  a wide-mouth glass jar or small bowl that will hold about 1 quart (to
  allow for expansion during fermentation). Place a piece of
  cheesecloth over the container and allow it to rest in a warm place
  for 24 hours. Stir and cover tightly with plastic wrap which will
  retain the moisture. The mixture will become light and foamy in 2 or
  3 days. Stir down each day.
  
  Pour the fermented starter into a glass jar, fitted with a tight lid,
  and place in the refrigerator.  In 3 or 4 days, when a clear liquid
  collects on top of the mixture, it will have ripened sufficiently to
  use.
  
  HONEY STARTER 1 package yeast 2 1/2 cups warm water 2 Tbsp honey 2
  1/2 cups unbleached or all-purpose flour
  
  Combine the yeast, water, honey, and flour in a quart jar which has a
  tight fitting cover.  Seal the jar and let the mixture ferment for 5
  days, stirring daily. Replenish the starter with water and flour in
  equal portions.
  
  SHEEPHERDER'S STARTER 1 3/4 cups bread or all-purpose flour 1 Tbsp
  EACH salt and sugar 1 package dry yeast 2
      1/2    cups warm water
  
  In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, sugar, yeast, and
  water. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to retain the
  moisture and put in a warm place for 4 days. Each day stir and
  re-cover. When it has fermented and smells pleasantly sour, it may be
  used or refrigerated.
  
  HOPS STARTER 3 cups water 1 quart fresh hops or 1/4 cup packaged dry
  hops 1/2  cup cornmeal, white or yellow 2 cups mashed potato 3 Tbsp
  sugar 2 tsp salt
  
  In a saucepan bring water to a boil and steep hops for 20 minutes.
  Drain and reserve the liquid; discard the hops. If necessary add
  water to make 3 full cups of liquid. Pour 1 cup of the hops liquid in
  a saucepan and stir in the cornmeal. Bring to a boil over medium
  heat, stirring constantly. When it thickens slightly, remove from
  heat.
  
  In a large mixing bowl combine cornmeal mixture, mashed potato, sugar,
  salt, and the remaining 2 cups of hops liquid. Cover the bowl with a
  length of cheesecloth and set in a warm place for 24 to 48 hours or
  until well fermented and bubbly.  Stir every 8 hours or so during
  this period.
  
  When the starter is frothy and smells pleasantly fermented, pour it
  into a two-quart glass jar with a tight fitting lid. Store in teh
  refrigerator until clear liquid has risen to the top of the mixture
  in about 2 days. Stir down - and it is ready to use.
  
  To replenish when only 1 cup remains:  add water, cornmeal, mashed
  potatoes, sugar, and salt (as to begin). Set in a warm place. It will
  ferment and become active in about 8 hours. Store in the refrigerator.

      Title: STARVING ARTISTS' FISH
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Boneless skinless
           -fish fillets
      1 sm Jar artichoke hearts
           -in oil
      2 tb Sliced  almonds
      2 tb Butter or margarine
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
           Tarragon or
           Thyme to taste
           (tarragon is better,IMO)
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  The origin was when I was a college student (won't say how long ago).
  We were all broke, except that one member of the group had a typical
  Italian Mama who sent periodic care packages of exotic goodies.
  Another member liked to fish, so we came up with:
  
  Drain artichoke hearts, reserving oil.  Place oil in a small saucepan,
  along with almonds, butter, cheese and herbs/spices. Heat until
  flavors are well combined.
  
  Meanwhile, place fish fillets in an ovenproof baking dish, folding if
  necessary to make an attractive presentation. Chop artichoke hearts,
  or arrange hearts to cover fish attractivelyu (a subject of some
  debate, I vote for cutting the hearts into attractive portions, and
  covering the fish)
  
  Pour the oil/butter/cheese, etc. mixture over the fish, place in a
  preheated 350 oven, and bake until the fish barely flakes. (10
  minutes or less).
  
  Serve with pasta dressed with oil, garlic and cheese, a green
  vegetable. Kathy in Bryan, TX

      Title: STATUS:
 Categories: Wasnone
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
      1/4 c  corn oil
       12    arbol chiles -- with seeds
        2    Roma (plum) tomatoes
        6 md cloves garlic
      3/4 c  water
      1/4 ts Mexican oregano -- toasted
      1/4 ts kosher salt
      1/4 ts cumin -- toasted and ground
  
  This is typical of what you would find on tables in northern Mexico,
  where salsas tend to be a little brutal -- hot and very direct with
  uncomplicated flavors. I love this kind of salsa on quesadillas and
  broiled meats. A great all-purpose condiment, a spoonful or two will
  enliven almost any dish. Be careful, though. People in the north like
  their food hot.
  
  Pan roast tomatoes until blistered, deeply browned, and soft. Pan
  roast garlic until brown and soft, then peel.
  
  Heat the corn oil in a medium-sized skillet until hot but not
  smoking. Fry the chiles, 1 or 2 at a time, until puffed and brown,
  about 10 seconds. Do not burn or they will taste bitter. Shake off
  excess oil from chiles and place in a blender. Add 2 tablespoons
  chile cooking oil, tomatoes, garlic, and water. Blend until smooth.
  Add the oregano, salt, and cumin and blend again. Keeps, tightly
  covered, about 3 days in the refrigerator.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Chuck Steak; trimmed, in
           -1.2 inch pieces
     12 oz Ox Kidney; Cored and Chopped
    1/4 pt Guinness

      2 lg Mushrooms; Sliced
    3/4 pt Beef Stock or water
      1    Bay Leaf
      4    Thyme; Sprigs

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE PASTRY----------------------------
      8 oz Self-raising Flour
      4 oz Shredded Suet or Lard
           Salt and Pepper
      1    Egg yolk; mixed with a
           -splash of milk
 
  Place the steak and kidney in a bowl with the guinness and herbs.
  Cover and leave for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Drain the
  meat, reserving the marinade. Toss the meat in the seasoned flour.
  Heat 1 tsp of the dripping or lard in a large, heavy pan and gently
  fry the onions for five minutes. Remove the onions to a plate, add
  more of the dripping to the pan and fry the floured meat in batches
  until it's browned on all sides. Return the onions and the rest of
  the meat and any remaining flour to the pan. Stir thoroughly, then
  add the mushrooms, marinade, herbs and stock or water. Bring slowly
  to a simmer, stirring as the sauce thickens, then cover the pan and
  cook gently for 1.5 hours. Taste the gravy, adjust the seasoning with
  salt and pepper and remove the herbs. Transfer to a deep pie dish,
  place a pie funnel in the middle and leave to cool.
  
  To Make the pastry. Sift the flour into a bowl. Sprinkle in the suet
  or add the lard, season with salt and pepper and mix lightly with
  your hands. Sprinkle in 2 tb of cold water, adding more as you mix
  with a knife. As it begins to clump together, use your hands to work
  it into a smooth, elastic dough. Leave to rest for five minutes, then
  roll out the pastry slightly thicker than normal. Cut a one-inch
  strip and lay it around the inside edge of the pie dish. Dampen it
  with water, then put the pastry lid in place. Trim and crimp the
  edge, knocking it back with the flat blade of a knife so that the
  actual edge looks as deep as possible. Make a small steamhole in the
  centre and cut some leaves from the pastry trimmings to decorate the
  top. Paint the pie lid with glaze. Bake in a pre-heated oven to
  200C/400F/Gas Mark 6 for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 180C/350F/Gas
  mark 4 and cook for 30 minutes until the pastry is golden brown.

 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Kidney, beef
      4 tb Shortening
      2    Onion; chopped
      2 lb Round steak; cubed
  1 1/2 tb Worcester sauce

  Wash the kidney, remove membranes and fat, and cut kidney in 1"
  cubes. Cube the steak into 1" cubes. Melt the shortening in a heavy
  pot. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until well browned. Add
  the steak and kidneys. When the meat is browned on all sides, pour on
  2 cups of boiling water, Worcester, salt, and pepper. Cove and cook
  over a very low heat for 1 1/2 hours, or until the steak is tender.
  Preheat the oven to 400 F. Blend the butter with the flour to make a
  beurre manie. Drop small pellets of this paste into the sauce and
  stir to thicken it. Put meat and sauce into a deep pie plate and
  sprinkle with parsley. If you wish to use a pastry topping, roll out
  the dough and cover the pie plate. Slash the top, crimp the edges,
  and bake about 30 minutes, or until well browned.
  
  Pastry:  Mix the flour and salt. Cut in the shortening with a pastry
  blender.  Combine lightly only until the mixture resembles coarse
  meal or very tine peas; its texture will not be uniform but will
  contain crumbs and small bits and pieces.  Sprinkle water over the
  flour mixture, a tablespoon at a time, and mix lightly with a fork,
  using only enough water so that the pastry will hold together when
  pressed gently into a ball.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      3 tb Flour
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Floured steak
      1    Floured kidney
      1    Onion, diced
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Dry sherry
           Beef stock
      1 tb Butter
      2    Eggs
     50 ml Milk
    200 g  Self-raising flour
 
  This is the no-fuss version great-grandma probably made on washing
  day when she hadn't the time to fiddle with pastry or pudding-making.
  Though the dish spends a long time in the oven looking after itself,
  it takes no time at all to make.
  
  Put three tablespoons of plain flour seasoned with salt and pepper in
  a plastic bag and shake to coat with flour. Transfer the floured
  steak and kidney to a large casserole with a lid and mix in one
  onion, diced. Over the top pour 1 tablespoon Worces- tershire sauce,
  2 tablespoons dry sherry and sufficient beef stock to reach the top
  of the meat. Cover the casserole and bake in a slow oven (140 degrees
  C) for
        3    hours.
  
  Cream 1 tablespoon softened butter or margarine, add 2 eggs and 50 mL
  milk and dredge in 220 g self-raising flour. Mix to a soft dough,
  turn out onto a floury surface and with floury hands pat out to the
  same dimensions as the interior of the casserole. Place the sponge
  dough on top of the steak and kidney, press well around the sides of
  the casserole and cook for a further half hour with the lid on. Cut
  the sponge into wedges and serve on top of generous amounts of steak
  and kidney.

      1 ts Worchestire
  1 1/2 tb Mustard
      2 tb Lemon juice

  Press the steak into the crushed peppercorns, working it into both
  sides of the meat. Brown the meat on both sides, in an uncovered pan
  on high heat. Reduce the heat and cook to desired temperature, then
  remove and hold warm while preparing the sauce. In the same pan melt
  the butter with the remaining ingredients, excluding the brandy. when
  all ingredients are combined and bubbling add the steak. Now you have
  two options, first increase the heat and continue to cook the
  mixture, add the brandy and flambe. Reduce and serve warmed or you
  can remove meat after flambing, reduce heat a little, add half and
  half, reduce mixture again and pour over steak. Both are excellant,
  it just depends if you want a cream sauce or a simple reduction. Hope
  you enjoy it! FROM: CINDY TICHY

      Title: STEAK WITH ROSEMARY OIL
 Categories: Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 lb Well-trimmed boneless
           -sirloin or rib-eye steak,
           -cut 3/4 inch thick
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      4    Sprigs (3-inch) fresh
           -rosemary, bruised with the
           -back of a heavy knife
 
  1. In a large heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. When it
  just begins to smoke, season both sides of the steak generously with
  salt and pepper and cook over moderately high heat for 3 minutes per
  side for medium rare. Transfer the steak to a warmed platter.
  
  2. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil and the rosemary to the
  skillet and stir frequently until the rosemary begins to color, about
  1 1/2 minutes. Scrape the oil over the steak, garnish with the
  rosemary sprigs and serve.
  
  To complement the flavor of the rosemary, stick with Cabernet
  Sauvignon, which has a hint of herbiness of its own and enough
  acerbity to tolerate the bite of the saut E9ed cherry tomatoes. Among
  a number of possibilities, consider the 1993 Chateau Montelena or the
  1992 Burgess from California-or a Bordeaux, such as the 1992 Chateau
  Leoville Barton.

      Title: STEAM PRESSURE CANNING OVERVIEW
 Categories: Inform, Canfood, Technique, Typed
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------STEAM PRESSURE CANNING------------------------
 
  Steam pressure canning is the method used for home canning of low acid
  foods, such as vegetables, meat, poultry, seafood, and soup. Mixed
  vegetable recipes that contain tomatoes are also considered low acid.
  In steam pressure canning, you pack jars with hot or cold food and
  place them on a rack in a pressure canner. Then you add water as the
  manufacturer directs, seal the canner, and heat it. The steam created
  is under pressure and reaches the superheated temperature of 240
  degrees F, which is capable of killing the harmful byproducts of the
  botulism bacteria. Most vegetables by be either cold or hot packed.
  
  Remember too, that altitude can affect the pressure in your steam
  pressure canner. Check the chart to find what adjustments may be
  necessary at your altitude. If your pressure canner has a weighted
  gauge, use 15 pounds pressure at all altitudes over 2,000 feet.
  
  ALTITUDE IN FEET                        PROCESS AT PRESSURE OF 2,000 -
  3,000;
   11-1/2    pounds 3,000 - 4,000; 12 pounds 4,000 - 5,000; 12-1/2
  pounds 5,000 - 6,000; 13 pounds 6,000 - 7,000;
   13-1/2    pounds 7,000 ~ 8,000; 14 pounds 8,000 - 9,000; 14-1/2
  pounds 9,000 - 10,000; 15 pounds
  
  A pressure canner is a large, heavy metal utensil that heats water
  under pressure to create steam. The steam is hotter than boiling
  water and can cook food to the 240 degree F needed to kill dangerous
  botulism bacteria. Although the initial expense of a steam pressure
  canner may seem high, it should last you through many, many years of
  gardening and canning. In addition, it can be used for quick cooking
  may other foods.
  
  Steam pressure canners come in several sizes, ranging from 8 to 22
  quarts in capacity and holding 4 to 7 one quart jars, or many more
  pint jars of food. You may already have a pressure cooker, or
  saucepan pressure cooker. You can use this for processing if it will
  hold pint jars, if it has an accurate gauge, and if it will maintain
  10 pounds of pressure. Add 20 minutes to the processing time given in
  the recipe if using a regular pressure cooker, or saucepan pressure
  cooker. Pressure canners and cookers differ slightly in construction;
  one type has a dial gauge, another a weighted gauge. Always follow
  the instructions that came with your particular canner to the letter.
  Always check the gasket and locking mechanism and clean all parts as
  the manufacturer directs.
  
  TESTING THE DIAL GAUGE Dial gauges must be checked each canning
  season. The home economist at your local Cooperative Extension
  Service Office can tell you where and when you can have the dial
  tested. If the dial varies more than 5 pounds per square inch either
  way, get a new one. If the variation is less than 5 pounds, adjust
  pressure using the chart below. Weighted gauges don't need to be
  tested, but they must be kept clean.
  
  If gauge reads low by   1 pound;   Process at pressure of 11 pounds.
        2    pounds;
       12    pounds.
        3    pounds;
       13    pounds.
        4    pounds;
       14    pounds.
  
  If gauge reads high by  1 pound;   Process at pressure of 9 pounds.
        2    pounds;
        8    pounds.
        3    pounds;
        7    pounds.
        4    pounds;
        6    pounds.
  
  Handle the dial gauges with care. NEVER rest the cover on the gauge
  and never turn the cover upside down over a full pan with the gauge
  attached, because moisture could enter the gauge and rust it.
  
  MAINTAINING PROPER HEAT LEVELS: Big pressure canners may cover the
  range burners completely. Set the pressure canner on the burner to be
  sure there's enough air space to keep gas burners on or to prevent
  the enamel of the range surface around the electric unit from growing
  too hot. If a pressure canner seems too snug against a burner, lift
  it up 1/4 to 1/2 inch on asbestos blocks or an extra gas burner ring,
  so that heat and air can circulate. (Make sure the asbestos blocks or
  extra gas burner ring does not itself cut down the air space of the
  gas burner or block the heating of the electric unit.)

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------BROWNIED CAKE MIX--------------------------
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon -- opt.
    1/3 c  Margarine -- or butter
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
      1 tb Dried buttermilk
      1 tb Dried eggs (scrambled egg
           Mix) -- beaten
    1/2 tb Vanilla sugar
    1/4 c  Walnuts -- finely chopped
    1/2 c  Water
 
  Needed:  two nestled pots.  The larger pot holds the water to steam
  the contents of the smaller pot inside. Both pots need lids or covers
  of heavy duty alumimum foil.
  
  Mix the cake ingredients ahead of time  cutting the margarine into
  the dry ingredients, and pack in a zip lock bag. Use large enough bag
  that it can be used as the mixing container.
  
  Grease the bottom and side of the smaller pot.  Add the water to the
  mix and beat by hand till smooth. Stir in nuts. Pour mixture into the
  prepared pot. Cover the pot. Put thesmaller pot inside the larger one
  and pour hot water up the side about 2/3 or 3/4 of the way up the
  side of the inside pot.  Put the lid on and set level on the edge of
  the fire so the water simmers and barely boils. Cook for 2 1/2 to 3
  hours or till cakes spring back when touched and a long wooden
  tooth-pick inserted near the centers comes out clean.

 Categories: Seafood, Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 qt Steamer clams, medium *

MMMMM-----------------LIME, CHIVE, MUSTARD MAYO----------------------
      1 x  Egg yolk, large
      1 tb Lime juice, fresh
  1 1/2 ts Dijon-style mustard
    3/4 c  Oil **
    1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
      1 pn White pepper, fresh
      2 ts Chives
    1/4 ts Lime zest, fresh ***
      3 dr Tabasco
 
  *     about 3 pounds ** corn, peanut, or other mild vegetable oil, NOT
  olive. ***   colored rind only, no pith. Steamer (or soft-shell)
  clams are naturally tender enough to be cooked, chilled, and sauced
  for a vivid and satisfying first course.  The sauce here is no kin
  whatsoever to the ketchupy stuff that too often swamps cold seafood;
  it's a good bet with cold shrimp or crabmeat, too. Small quahogs (on
  the East Coast) or Manila or other local hard clams (West Coast) may
  be substituted for steamers. Because their shelled-out meats are
  firmer and their necks needn't be skinned, they tend to be neater
  morsels than the raggedy soft-shells, but steamers hold the edge from
  flavor. Be sure to steam hard clams just until they begin to open;
  they can toughen in a flash if over-cooked. Boil half an inch of
  water in a large pot.  Add the well-scrubbed clams (see STORING &
  CLEANING CLAMS), cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Uncover
  (to prevent boiling over) and cook, shaking the pot or stirring the
  shellfish whenever the foam boils high, for 2 or 3 minutes, or just
  until all the clams have opened. Pour the potful into a collander set
  over a big bowl; reserve the broth. When the clams have cooled, shuck
  them, pulling off and discarding the rubbery ring of membrane
  encircling the bodies as well as the loose, dark skin covering the
  "neck," or siphon. Place in a big bowl. Strain the broth onto the
  clams through cheesecloth in a sieve; stop pouring before any sand
  appears. Stir and swish the clams through the broth to further desand
  them (some grains always survive the earlier steps). Lift out the
  clams with a slotted spoon and set them aside. Let the broth settle,
  strain it again, and repeat the clam rinsing and draining, twice if
  it seems a good idea. Chill the clams. Refrigerate or freeze the
  broth for a future chowder or sauce. No more than 3 hours before
  serving, drain the clams again and fold them into about half the
  mayonnaise. Refrigerate. To serve, divide the sauced clams among
  seafood cocktail glasses or small glass bowls.  Top with more
  mayonnaise; garnish with a leaf or two of green stuff -- parsley,
  coriander, watercress, or baby lettuce. LIME, CHIVE, & MUSTARD
  MAYONNAISE: Whisk together the egg yolk, lime juice, and mustard.
  Whisking hard, begin adding oil a few drops at a time, beating in
  each addition completely before adding more. After the mixture has
  thickened, add the remaining oil in a thin stream while beating
  rapidly. Season with salt, pepper, chives, lime zes, and Tabasco.
  Taste carefully; the mayonnaise should be highly seasoned, so add
  more lime juice, mustard, pepper, and/or Tabasco if needed, but be
  cautious about the salt -- the clams will supply enough brininess for
  most tastes. Refrigerate until needed. STORING & CLEANING CLAMS:
  Store fresh clams in the refrigerator with a light covering, not
  airtight. Clean them as close to cooking time as possible.  To clean,
  scrub the shells under the running cold tap with a vegetable or
  potato brush; give special attention to the hinges. Cover with fresh
  water and soak for an hour or so, stirring them about once or twice.
  Lift them out of the soaking water to leave behind the sand they will
  have shed.

 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Limes
      1 tb Brown sugar
      4    Star anise, divided (see
           Note)
    1/8 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
    1/3 c  Water
      4    Boneless and skinless
           Chicken breast halves
 
  1. Squeeze the juice out of the limes.  Reserve the peels. Measure 3
     tablespoons juice.
  
  2. In a small saucepan, combine the lime juice, brown sugar, 2 star
  anise,
     crushed red pepper, soy sauce and water.  Bring to a boil, reduce
  the
     heat and simmer 4 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool.
  
  3. Put the chicken in a glass dish and spoon half of the soy mixture
  over,
     turning to coat.  Marinate at room temperature 1 hour, or cover and
     refrigerate for longer marination, up to 24 hours.
  
  4. When ready to steam the chicken, put the lime peels, 2 star anise
  and
     about 8 cups of water into a large pot and bring to a boil. Fit a
     steamer basket or rack over the top.  Remove the chicken from the
     marinade, discarding the leftover marinade, and place in the
  steamer.
     Cover tightly and steam about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is
  no
     longer pink in the center.
  
  5. In a small saucepan cook down the remaining soy mixture until
  reduced
     to about 2 tablespoons.  (You can add a little water if you reduce
  the
     mixture too much.)  Spoon over the steamed chicken.
  
  Note: Star anise is a dried spice with a pungent, licorice flavour.
  It can be purchased at most Asian groceries. You can substitute 1/2
  teaspoon lightly crushed anise seed for 2 star anise, although the
  flavour will not be as distinctive.

    1/2 c  Almonds
    3/4 c  Boiling water
    1/3 c  Molasses or honey
    1/2 ts Pure almond extract
    1/2 c  Dried apricots
 
  Servings: Makes 1 loaf.
  
  In a large bowl, combine the oats, rice flour, amaranth flour and
  baking soda.
  
  Grind the almonds to a fine powder in a blender. Gradually add enough
  water to bring the level up to 1 cup. With the machine running, add
  the molasses or honey and almond extract. Add the apricots and
  process with a few on/off turns to chop them; do not puree.
  
  Pour the liquid mixture into the flour bowl.  Stir to mix. Turn out
  into an oiled 1 qt. mold or 1 lb can. Cover with a square of wax
  paper or foil (shiny side down); tie wax paper securely with a piece
  of string.
  
  Place the mold on a wire rack in a Dutch oven or large stockpot. Add
  enough boiling wate to the pot to come halfway up the sides of the
  mold. Cover the pot tightly, and steam the bread over med-low heat
  for 2 hours. Do not remove the cover during the cooking time.
  
  Remove the mold from the pot.  Cool the bread in the mold for 15 min,
  then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. For best results,
  slice with a serrated knife.
  
  Variations:  Replace the rice flour with 1/3 c rice polish and 1/3 c
  rice bran.  You can also replace the amaranth flour with either 1/4 c
  soy flour, 1/4 c white buckwheat flour or 1/4 c ground sunflower
  seeds.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Brown sugar
      2 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Seedless raisins
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      5    Thin slices good-quality
           -white bread
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  (1/2 sticks) butter,
           -softened
      3    Eggs
 
  In the top of an oiled double boiler, mix the brown sugar and raisins.
  Remove crusts from bread, butter the slices on one side, and then cut
  them into 1/2 inch cubes; you should have about 2 cups. Place the
  cubes on top of the brown-sugar mixture.
  
  In a medium bowl, beat the eggs lightly, then add the remaining
  ingredients--just blend, don't overmix. Pour the egg mixture over the
  bread cubes, but do not stir in. Cook, covered, over simmering water,
  for about 1 hour and 20- minutes.  A knife inserted in the center
  should come out fairly clean. (Pudding will continue cooking after
  taken out of pan, so don't worry if it is still a bit shaky at the
  end of the cooking time.)
  
  Immediately loosen the edges of the pudding with a rubber spatula and
  invert onto a 12 inch round platter with a lip. Arrange any stray
  raisins decoratively around the edge of the platter. Serve warm.

 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lg Chicken breast
      8    Dried Nami black mushrooms
      2    Green onions
      8    Water chestnuts
      1    Chinese sausage (opt)

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      2 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb Cornstarch
      2    Slices ginger root/minced
      1 ts Sesame oil
      2 tb Thin soy sauce
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Sugar
 
  Preparation:  Soak dried mushrooms in hot water for 1/2 hour or until
  soft. Remove stems; thinly slice caps. Debone chicken; slice into
  1/2" thick, quarter-size coins; place pieces in shallow, heat-proof
  dish. Add marinade ingredients to chicken; marinate for at least 30
  minutes. Slice water chestnuts in thin circles.  Cut green onions on
  bias into 1" sections.
  
  There are 2 varieties of "Cantonese-style" Chinese semi-dried sausage
  available in Chinese markets: duck liver & sweet pork meat. Either
  will do for this dish. Cut sausage on bias into 1/8" thick slices.
  Marinade is not used with sausage.
  
  Steaming:  Mix sliced mushrooms & water chestnuts with chicken. If
  desired, add sausage. Steam for 20 minutes. If using deep bowl, stir
  chicken after 10 minutes to make certain bottom pieces get cooked.
  Just before serving, add green onions. Serve immediately, since
  cornstarch will become gummy if dish is allowed to cool.
  
  HINT: If using metal steamer, stretch dish towel under steamer cover,
  to prevent build-up of condensed steam in dish.

      Title: STEAMED BUNS
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  Here's a recipe for a basic steamed bread dough and some fillings for
  steamed buns.  These are all easy and tasty. If you don't want to
  hassle with making the dough, you can use frozen bread dough and get
  good results ++they're better baked than steamed, though. I do that a
  lot.
  
  The sausage buns are quite good when baked.  Also, if you have a bread
  making machine that can be set to stop at a certain point in the
  process, that would save time too.
  
  Any of these ingredients can be had at an Asian grocery and in many
  supermarkets these days.
  
  Steamed or Baked Bun Dough
  
  Yield: 2 dozen buns
  
  1 ea cake of fresh compressed yeast 1 3/4 c warm water 3/4 c sugar 1 t
  baking powder 6 1/2 c unsifted all purpose flour
  
  TO MAKE THE DOUGH:
  
  Dissolve 1/2 yeast cake with sugar in warm water. Immediately add
  baking powder and then the flour.  The dough will be fairly firm and
  a bit on the dry side. Knead on board or 20 minutes (you should not
  need to flour the board) until dough becomes elastic and smooth.
  Place it in a big mixing bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a
  dry, warm place (away from drafts) until dough doubles in bulk.
  (Every kitchen is different. My dough usually takes about 2 1/2 to 3
  hours to double in my electric oven, which I slightly preheat to a
  warm setting for 2 or 3 minutes then turn off.) Now punch down dough
  and knead again for 5 more minutes. It is no ready to be stuffed with
  fillings.
  
  Comments:  This is just a basic yeast dough with perhaps a bit more
  sugar added. For those of you who do not care to make this from
  scratch, you may use frozen bread dough as a substitute.
  
  FILLING AND COOKING THE BUNS:
  
  Wrapping:
  
  Divide filling into 24 portions.  Divide dough into 24 balls.
  
  Slightly flatten each ball then roll out into 4-inch discs, leaving
  the center of the disc twice as thick as the side. Place 1 portion of
  the filling in the center of the dough. Gather up the sides around
  the filling and twist dough to seal.  Place on a 2 inch square piece
  of wax paper, twist side down.  Put the wrapped buns at least 2
  inches apart on a cookie sheet and allow the buns to rise in a
  draft-free place (the oven) for another hour.
  
  Steaming:
  
  Steam for 15 minutes.  Turn off heat and let steam subside before
  lifting cover.  [If you don't have an Oriental steamer, you can
  improvise by setting a plate on an upside down bowl or can with the
  ends cut out in a big kettle or stock pot.  Fill the pot with water
  up to the bottom of the plate, but not so high that the boiling water
  slops over the edge. S.C.]
  
  Baking:
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Set buns 2 inches apart on cookie sheet.
  
  Brush with a mixture of 1 beaten egg white, 1 teaspoon water and 1/4
  teaspoon sugar.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.
  Brush with melted butter.

      Title: STEAMED BUNS WITH DIPPING SAUCE
 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 md Red bell pepper, finely
           Diced (I'd use more next
           Time )
      2    Scallions, finely chopped
           (both white and green parts;
           Reserve 1*teaspoon
           For dipping sauce)
      1    Minced garlic clove (reserve
           1/8*t for dipping
           Sauce)
           Marinated mushrooms from
           Above recipe
    1/4 c  Whole water chestnuts,
           Finely diced
      1 tb Hoisin sauce
      1 tb All-purpose flour
           Bun dough (see above
           Recipe)
      3 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
      1 ts White vinegar
    1/4 ts Hot chili oil
           Chopped cilantro for
           Garnish
 
  In large non-stick saucepan, add bell pepper, scallions, and garlic,
  and cook, stirring constantly, until peppers are soft, 5-8 minutes.
  Chop mushrooms (the pieces need to be fairly small to go in the
  dumplings) and add, with marinade, to peppers. Add water chestnuts
  and hoison sauce; cook until most of liquid has evaporated, 3-4
  minutes. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  Sprinkle work surface with flour. Turn bun dough out onto prepared
  surface, knead 1 minute and roll into a log, about 16" long and 1
  1/2" wide. Cut dough into 16 equal pieces and roll each into a ball.
  Flatten each ball with the palm of your hand into a 3" diameter
  circle. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling mixture in center of each
  dough round, and gather up edges to enclose filling, twisting edges
  together and pressing to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and
  filling, covering buns with plastic wrap.
  
  WARNING: This takes a little practice, so I'd recommend that you plan
  on *not* serving the first 2 or 3 you make to company. =-)
  
  Line steamer rack with cheesecloth or wax paper (I used cabbage
  leaves). Place in large shallow saucepan or wok; add 2" water, cover
  and bring to rolling boil. Arrange 8 of the buns at least 1" apart on
  prepared steamer rack; cover and steam until puffy, tender and cooked
  through, 15-20 minutes. Repeat with remaining buns, adding water to
  pan as necessary. (I did this in my Black and Decker steamer, which
  only allowed for 4 dumplings at a time. I filled the water to the
  highest water mark, refilling after steaming 8 dumplings.)
  
  Meanwhile, prepare dipping suace: In small bowl, combine soy sauce, 1
  tablespoon water, the reserved scallions, the vinegar, the reserved
  garlic, and the hot chili oil, if using; sprinkle with cilantro, if
  using.
  
  Serve freshly steamed buns immediately, with dipping suace on the
  side, or cool and freeze for later use. (To reheat, thaw until soft
  and steam until warmed through, 5 minutes.)
  
  Enjoy! The recipe also says that you can use other veggies and sauces
  ~- try chopping up your favorite ff chinese dish and making it into a
  filling!

      Title: STEAMED BUTTERFISH IN BEAN THREADS
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      8    To 10 dried shiitake
           -mushrooms
  1 1/2 oz To 2 oz bundle bean threads
      1 lb Butterfish (about 6),
           -cleaned
    1/3 c  Chicken stock
      2    Green onions, shredded
  1 1/2 tb Shredded ginger
  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Asian sesame oil
 
  There are a couple of kinds of butterfish.  One is the large
  "sablefish". The other is the smaller silvery diamond shaped fish
  familiar to those who hang out around Asian markets. This calls for
  the latter type.
  
  In separate bowls, soak the mushrooms in warm water and the bean
  threads in hot water until soft, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the
  mushrooms, discard the stems, and toss the caps with a teaspoon of
  soy sauce. Drain the bean threads and place in a deep heat-proof
  plate or glass pie pan that will fit inside a wok or other steaming
  pot.
  
  Arrange the fish on top, tucking the mushroom caps in around them.
  Pour in the chicken stock, scatter the green onion and ginger on top
  of the fish, and sprinkle with the remaining soy sauce.
  
  Bring the water in the steamer to a rolling boil and place the plate
  on a rack an inch above the water. Cover and steam for 20 minutes.
  Sprinkle with the sesame oil and serve from the steaming dish. Serves
  2 to 3 as a main dish, 4 with other dishes.

      Title: STEAMED CARROT PUDDING
 Categories: Puddings, Welsh
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
      2 c  Flour, all-purpose,
           -sifted and measured
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
    3/4 ts Cloves
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Baking powder,

MMMMM---------------------OTHER INGREDIENTS--------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Potatoes (raw),
           -grated, or ground
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 c  Carrots (raw), ground
           -(use medium blade)
  1 1/2 c  Bread crumbs
           -(dry, not toasted)
  1 1/2 c  Crisco (vegetable
           -shortening)
      2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
  1 1/2 c  Brown sugar (light
           -or dark, depends
           -on what you like)
  1 1/2 ts Lemon extract
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Walnuts, finely chopped
           -(black walnuts are
           -wonderful if you can
           -get them)
     15 oz Raisins

MMMMM---------------------SAUCE INGREDIENTS--------------------------
    1/4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Brown sugar (I use a
           -mixture of light and dark)
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Lemon extract
    1/8 ts Cornstarch, well-divided
      1 tb Butter
 
  MAKE PUDDING:  Mix the dry ingredients and set them aside. Grease
  completely three large (25-oz) tin cans, such as the kind used for
  tomato puree.  Do NOT use the plastic-lined variety. Alternatively,
  grease one large steaming mold, with a hole in the center. Or
  improvise.
  
  Add the potatoes.  Mix well.  Then, in turn, add the baking soda, the
  carrots, the bread crumbs and the Crisco, making sure that you mix
  well after adding each ingredient. This matters, so do it! You may
  have to get some help from King Kong to blend adequately after adding
  the shortening.
  
  Add, in sequence, the brown sugar, the beaten egg, the lemon extract
  and the vanilla, mixing well after each addition. Now, add the dry
  ingredients mixture, a bit at a time. The mixture will be extremely
  thick and very difficult to mix.  Add the walnuts and the raisins.
  Mix them in. Go ahead. You're strong enough.
  
  Push the mixture into the tins, with each about 3/4 full, or a little
  more. Seal the tins with aluminum foil and use a rubber band to hold
  the foil on (the pudding should not be exposed directly to the
  steam). Steam 1 1/2 to 2 hours, (until the pudding seems uniform. You
  can't overcook it, so err on the long side, please!) and cool if
  you're not going to serve it right now.
  
  Make the sauce by combining all of the sauce ingredients in a small
  saucepan and heating until it bubbles and all ingredients are
  dissolved. To serve, reheat by steaming for at least 45 minutes, or
  serve out of the original pot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An old Welsh steamed carrot pudding -- This is a good steamed
  pudding, despite the list of ingredients that are "good for you". The
  sauce (following the recipe) is not a necessity for good taste, only
  for authenticity, although I LIKE it with the sauce. Some add rum to
  this sauce.  Suit yourself.  I like it both ways.
  
  This is a very old recipe, I gathered it from my grandmother, who
  would have been 101 (sniff) this year, who learned it from her Welsh
  mother, who learned it from her... (in Wales), ergo it's at least
  200+. Given its similarity to some late Medieval puddings, one might
  suspect that its origins are much earlier. I determined the
  quantities listed here by measuring what my grandmother tossed into
  the pot. Yield: makes about 5 pounds.
  
  *  This stuff keeps in the fridge nearly forever (at least a month)
  as long as you don't let it dry out.
  
  *  Decant or spoon out (depends on if you want to be fancy or not) and
  serve with sauce. Then, don't eat for two days to make up for the
  calories.
  
  Difficulty:  moderate (considerable physical work required); Time: 1
  hour preparation, 3 hours steaming; Precision: no need to measure.

      Title: STEAMED CHERRY POUND CAKE
 Categories: Dessert, Steamed foo
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 pk Pound Cake Mix -- (16 oz)
    2/3 c  -Water
      2    Whole Eggs
     20    To 30 Marachino Cherries
           Drained
      3 tb -All-Purpose Flour
 
  Cherry Pound Cake 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours To  Cook: Turn the cake mix,
  water, and eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric
  beater on low. In a small bowl, combine the maraschino cherries with
  the flour. Toss the cherries well in the flour so that all the
  moisture on the cherries is absorbed. Pour the batter into a greased
  and floured 2-quart mold or spring-form pan, Drop the cherries into
  the batter from high enough up so they sink into it. (This maneuver
  keeps all the cherries, which are heavier than the batter, from
  sinking to the bottom of the cake.) Place the pan in the slow cooker
  and cover with a loosely fitting plate. Cover the pot, but prop the
  lid open a fraction with a toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess
  steam escape. Cook on High for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. When a toothpick
  inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, the cake is done.
  Cool the cake on a rack for 10 to 15 minutes before you turn it out
  of the pan. Let it cool thoroughly before serving. Makes 10 to 12
  servings. "Clear & Simple Crockery Cooking", by Jacqueline Heriteau

 Categories: Chinese, Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Chicken meat, minced
      2 c  Bean curd, mashed
      3    Egg whites
    1/2 ts Ginger juice
      1 tb Gin
      1 tb Peanut oil
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Five-spice powder
      1 pn Sugar
      1 lg Carrot
    1/2 c  Stock
      1 ts Sesame oil
           Cornstarch paste
      3 lg Cabbage or lettuce leaves
 
  This dish looks good, tastes good and is simple to prepare. It is one
  of a family of pudding-like dishes.
  
  Preparation:  All mixing can be done in food processor. Or, use
  cleaver to finely mince chicken and mash bean curd. In bowl, combine
  egg whites, oil, ginger juice, gin, salt, five-spice powder and
  sugar; stir to breakdown egg and blend.  Add chicken and bean curd;
  mix thoroughly. Dip cabbage leaves in boiling water to make limp.
  Wash and peel carrot; slice thinly on bias.
  
  Steaming:  Place limp leaves in shallow bowl.  Arrange carrots on
  leaves in decorative pattern.  Pack chicken/bean curd mixture tightly
  in bowl to fill it. Steam for about 40 minutes at medium boil.
  Steaming will make mixture very smooth and firm (avoid over-steaming,
  which causes bean curd to become dry and hard). When ready to serve,
  turn out on serving platter; gently remove leaves; cover with glaze.
  
  Glaze:  Heat stock in saucepan; when hot, add cornstarch paste to
  thicken. When ready to use, reheat and add sesame oil; pour over dish.

  surrounded by the longer-cooking dark meat. Put some water in the
  bottom of the wok. Use enough that it won't boil away, but not so
  much that it touches the plate. The food must be suspended at least 1
  inch above the water level. Cover the wok tightly so that the steam
  is captured under the lid and can circulate freely around the food.
  Keep a kettle of water on hand to replenish the steaming liquid in
  the wok if the level gets too low. Be careful not to pour the water
  onto the food. Makes 4 to 6 Servings

      Title: STEAMED CHICKPEAS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Appetizers, Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Dried chickpeas (garbanzos)
      8 c  Water
      1 ts Salt garlic salt
 
  Soak chickpeas for 6 hours in water.  Pour off water. Steam
  chickpeas, for approximately 1 hour, maybe more, until tender and yet
  chewy. Do not overcook to mushiness. Drain thoroughly, cool and
  sprinkle with salt and garlic salt.
  
  I used a rice steamer and the flavor of the chickpeas is totally
  different (almost like a peanut) from the canned or the usual boiled
  flavor. They were just del icious!
  
  So just out of curiosity, I tried steaming a small handful of several
  different beans, altogether (small red, kidney, black beans, lima,
  navy, adzuki, pinto). (By the way, soak black beans separately, they
  stain the white beans a very attractive shade of gray!) Same result!
  I ended up just snacking on them by the handful. I never even got far
  enough to use them for soup or something, they were so good by
  themselves! This will be great for summer when it's too hot to cook!
  
  Try experimenting with different spices (cumin, red pepper, cajun,
  italian etc.).  I will probably never use canned or simmered beans
  again, if I can help it. I'm definitely not a cooking purist, but the
  difference with this steaming method is enormous! From Fatfree Digest

 Categories: Main dish, Fish, Appetizers, Microwave
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Steamers
    1/4 c  Water
 
  1. Place steamers and 1/4 cup water in a cooking bag. 2. Tie the top
  of the bag with string. Do not use metal fasteners. 3. Pierce 3 holes
  near the top of the bag to allow the steam to escape. 4. Heat in
  Microwave Oven 6 minutes or until shells open. Tip: The live clams
  can be placed in a shallow pan with enough water to cover. Sprinkle a
  handful of cornmeal over them and let stand a few hours or overnight.
  They will absorb the cornmeal into their systems and it will clean
  out any sand as well as help in whitening the clam meat.

      Title: STEAMED FISH WITH BLACK BEANS
 Categories: Fish, Seafood, Oriental
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Whole fish (1-1/2 to 2 lbs)
           -(sea bass, whitefish, pike,
           - trout, rock cod)
           - cleaned and scaled
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1    1" piece fresh ginger root
           - smashed
      2    Garlic cloves
           - roughly chopped
      2 tb Fermented black beans
      2    Whole scallions; shredded
      3 sl Fresh ginger root; shredded
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Chinese rice wine
           -=OR=- Dry sherry
      1 pn Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
 
  PLACE THE FISH ON A PLATTER large enough to hold it, and sprinkle it
  with salt. Squeeze the chunk of ginger in your hand to extract the
  juice, letting it sprinkle over the fish. (The ginger must be fresh
  and you must have strong hands to do this; as an alternative, use a
  garlic press.) Chop the garlic and fermented black beans together.
  Don't chop too fine or the mixture will become a paste and turn
  bitter. Scatter the beans, garlic, shredded scallions and shredded
  ginger over the fish. Mix the soy sauce, rice wine and sugar. Pour it
  over the fish. If the plate is too long to fit in a bamboo steamer or
  a wok, improvise a steamer. For example, a roasting pan could serve
  the purpose, with a trivet standing in the middle to hold the plate.
  Set the plate on the trivet. Pour boiling water into the pan, but not
  enough to reach the plate. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and crimp
  the edges to seal it. Put the pan over low heat to keep the water
  simmering. A fish 1-inch thick at its widest point will take 10
  minutes in the steamer. (The covered pan can also be placed in a 400F
  oven to cook for the same length of time.) When the fish is done,
  remove the plate from the steamer. A thin sauce will have formed on

      Title: STEAMED FISH WITH BLACK BEANS #1
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Whole fish (1-1/2 to 2 lbs)
           -(sea bass, whitefish, pike,
           - trout, rock cod)
           - cleaned and scaled
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1    1" piece fresh ginger root
           - smashed
      2    Garlic cloves
           - roughly chopped
      2 tb Fermented black beans
      2    Whole scallions, shredded
      3 sl Fresh ginger root, shredded
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Chinese rice wine
           -=OR=- Dry sherry
      1 pn Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
 
  PLACE THE FISH ON A PLATTER large enough to hold it, and sprinkle it
  with salt. Squeeze the chunk of ginger in your hand to extract the
  juice, letting it sprinkle over the fish. (The ginger must be fresh
  and you must have strong hands to do this; as an alternative, use a
  garlic press.) Chop the garlic and fermented black beans together.
  Don't chop too fine or the mixture will become a paste and turn
  bitter. Scatter the beans, garlic, shredded scallions and shredded
  ginger over the fish. Mix the soy sauce, rice wine and sugar. Pour it
  over the fish. If the plate is too long to fit in a bamboo steamer or
  a wok, improvise a steamer. For example, a roasting pan could serve
  the purpose, with a trivet standing in the middle to hold the plate.
  Set the plate on the trivet. Pour boiling water into the pan, but not
  enough to reach the plate. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and crimp
  the edges to seal it. Put the pan over low heat to keep the water
  simmering. A fish 1-inch thick at its widest point will take 10
  minutes in the steamer. (The covered pan can also be placed in a 400F

  remove the plate from the steamer. A thin sauce will have formed on

      Title: STEAMED FISH WITH FISH GRAVY
 Categories: African, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Whole red snapper or
           -similar fish, 2 to 4
           -pounds, gutted and split
           With the head on
      1    Lime
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Freshly ground pepper
      8    Garlic cloves, minced
      2 tb White wine vinegar
      1    Fresh hot pepper, minced
      2 md Onions, thinly sliced
      1 sm Green pepper, thinly sliced
      1 lb Shrimp
      1    Fish head
      3 c  Water
      1    Stalk celery
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 c  Flour
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Thyme
 
  Here's one that I though you might like as it's African in origin.
  Looks pretty tasty to me!  Although it calls the fish "steamed" it
  would probably be more accurate to call it braised.
  
  Wash the fish with the juice of the lime.  Rinse, drain and pat dry.
  Cut 3 or 4 diagonal gashes in each side of the fish, cutting forward
  toward the head.
  
  Make a mixture of the salt, pepper, 2 cloves of the garlic, the
  vinegar and a little of the minced hot pepper. Grind to a paste. Rub
  the gashes and the inside surfaces of the fish with the paste. Place
  the fish in a flat glass baking dish and cover with the onions
  (reserving a few), the green pepper and the remaining garlic and hot
  pepper. Marinate for one hour.
  
  Meanwhile, shell the shrimp, reserving the shells. Coarsely chop the
  shrimp and set aside.  Place the shells and the extra fish head in a
  large saucepan with the water, reserved onion and celery. Simmer for
       15    minutes.
  
  Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet.  Shake the marinade off
  the fish and dredge the fish in flour. Fry quickly, for 3 to 4
  minutes on each side, until golden brown but not done. Lower the heat
  and add the marinade vegetables.  Pour in 2 cups of the fish-shrimp
  stock. Add the bay leaf, thyme and a little more salt and pepper.
  Cover and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove the fish and
  vegetables with a slotted spoon to a serving dish.  Set aside and
  keep warm.
  
  Add 2 tablespoons flour to the skillet and stir.  Cook slowly,
  scraping the bottom of the skillet, until the gravy starts to
  thicken. Strain the gravy and return it to the now clean skillet. Add
  the shrimp and cook until they turn pink and the gravy is thick.
  Serve the shrimp gravy over the fish.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  From the "Family of the Spirit Cookbook:  Recipes and Remembrances
  from African-American Kitchens," by John Pinderhughes (Simon and
  Schuster. 1990).
  
  The author recommends that if you can't get another fish head,
  decapitate the fish and use it to make the stock. Snapper is called
  for but he says that Hawaiian relatives of snapper ++onaga, opakapaka
  or ta'ape can be substituted as can Pacific rockfish.

      6    Slices ginger root
      2 tb Dry sherry
      3    Spring onions or Chinese
           Parsley

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2    Bell pepper, diced
      1 ts Curry powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 c  Stock
      1 ts Ginger, minced
      1    Clove garlic, minced
      2 tb Peanut oil
           Cornstarch paste
 
  Make Sauce:  Heat oil in medium-hot saucepan.  Saute minced garlic
  until fragrant.  Add curry powder.  Stir over medium heat for about 1
  minute - avoid burning powder. Add stock, salt, sugar and ginger;
  bring to boil; cook for 1 minute.  Add bell pepper, which has been

  before serving.
  
  Clean & Steam Crab:  Pry off plate from crab in one piece. Separate
  legs with cleaver; wash all parts, cleaning out junk; cut soft inner
  sections of legs into manageable pieces. Carefully crack claws,
  keeping them intact. Reassemble crab on oval platter. Before putting
  on back, sprinkle meat with dry sherry; lay ginger on top; then put
  on back plate. Wash green onions, remove roots, and shred, greens and
  all, into 2" sections.
  
  Bring water in steamer to rolling boil.  Steam crab for about 15-20
  minutes, depending on size. Meanwhile, reheat curry sauce (or keep
  hot in double boiler). Remove steamed crab from steamer; drain excess
  water. Lift back plate off crab; pour curry sauce over crab; sprinkle

      Title: STEAMED GINGER CHICKEN WITH BLACK BEANS
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Frying chicken
      2 ts Ginger juice,
           -or minced ginger
      2 ts Sugar
    3/4 ts Salt
  3 1/2 tb Cornstarch
      4 ts Sesame oil
  2 1/2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Sherry
    1/4 c  Salted fermented black beans
      1    Clove garlic
 
  Chop the chicken, bones and all, into Chinese serving pieces--about
  an inch and a half. Use a juicer to get the 2 teaspoons of ginger
  juice. You can just mince it, but there will be a subtle difference.
  Put the chicken into a big bowl and sprinkle with the ginger juice or
  minced ginger. Combine sugar, salt, cornstarch, sesame oil, soy sauce
  and booze in another bowl. Blend it to a smooth paste. Rinse the
  black beans in a strainer until visible salt is gone. Drain and mince
  finely along with the garlic. Add to the seasoning paste and mix
  well. Add all this to the chicken and mix to coat thoroughly.
  
  At this point, I put the chicken on two 8 inch pie plates and put each
  plate into a steamer compartment on my aluminum steamer. If you don't
  have one you can improvise using a large pot and a low-sided dish
  held just above the water by an inverted dish or whatever. The idea
  is to allow the steam to circulate around the chicken while keeping
  the boiling water from splashing into the dish holding the it. Start
  the water boiling and place the plate onto the inverted dish in the
  large pot. Cover tightly and steam for 25 to 30 minutes--a little
  longer if you like your chicken well done. The water should be
  boiling just enough to produce steam. When you're handling the dish,
  BE CAREFUL. Steam burns are no fun.
  
  This makes enough for four served with rice. (And there won't be any
  leftovers.) I serve it with steamed rice, a bowl of chopped up green
  onions, and small dishes of hot mustard, hoisin sauce and Vietnamese
  chili dip. I usually put out small dishes of Chinkiang vinegar and
  spiced salt as well. Dip a piece of chicken into the sauce of your
  choice and then into the green onions and enjoy! The taste is rich
  and subtle, the chicken succulent and steamy. The green onions and
  dips serve as a counterpoint the richness.
  
  It's one of the few Chinese dishes I know that I can serve to someone
  who "doesn't like Chinese food" with no problems. It's a quick and
  easy dish once you get it down. The fermented black beans, hoisin
  sauce, fresh ginger and sesame oil are fairly specialized, but any
  good Oriental market and many supermarkets will carry them. All will
  keep for a long time in the fridge. The sesame oil is the dark,
  cooked Oriental variety, not the health store variety. The latter
  won't work. While you're in the Chinese market, pick up a can of
  preserved tea melons or sweet mixed pickles. They're an excellent
  accompa- niment. Water melon pickles or chutneys also go well with
  it. One hint--don't let the chicken sit in the bean sauce mixture too
  long. It's not a marinade and will become overpowering if left too
  long.

           Text Only
 
  How to Save a Pot of Burnt Rice:
  
  If the rice should scorch while it is cooking, the pot of rice may
  still be rescued.  Simply place a dampened cloth or a slice of bread
  and I or 2 tablespoons of water over the surface of the rice, cover,
  lower the heat to a simmer and cook until rice is tender.  The cloth
  or bread will absorb the burnt smell.
  
  [This really does work quite well.  I've done the bread version and it
  saved the meal.  S.C.]
  
  Steamed Glutinous Rice:
  
  Glutinous rice may be prepared in the same manner as steamed long-
  grain rice by increasing the soaking period to 4 hours and the
  cooking time to 35 minutes.
  
  How to Reheat Rice:
  
  Cooked rice may be reheated in several ways.  To reheat by simmering,
  place the rice in a saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Then for each
  cup of rice, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of water over the surface of the
  rice, cover and simmer over low heat until the rice is hot. To reheat
  by steaming, place the rice in a heat proof bowl, sieve or colander
  and place this with about 2 inches of water in a large pot. Cover and
  steam over medium heat for 10 minutes or until heated through. To
  reheat in the oven, place rice in heat proof dish or pan and sprinkle
  1 tablespoon of water for each cup of rice over the surface.  Place,
  covered, in a preheated 400F oven for 20 minutes.

  This one pretty much sums up the idea that in Asia things are not
  always what they seem.  Looking at the picture, I see what are
  obviously steamed pears++complete with stems++with a couple of water
  caltrops on one plate and steamed finger citrons (an Asian fruit that
  looks sorta like a hand) accompanied by a couple of peaches on the
  other plate. (Water caltrops are those seeds that look like a set of
  miniature water buffalo horns.) What these things really are, though,
  are steamed, stuffed sweet dumplings. I really wish I could post a
  .gif with this message. These things look REAL! Somehow, I doubt that
  anyone will want to attempt this one, but here it is just in case.
  
  Establishment: Yung Kee Restaurant 36-40 Wellington Street, Central,
  Hong Kong Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award - Desserts
  
  THE NEVER ENDING STORY (12 servings) Chef: Yau Shing (Yung Kee
  Restaurant) "Longevity" would be an over-simplified literal
  translation for this dual presentation of treasured culinary symbols
  crafted out of flour. Peaches symbolize longevity, and fairy tales
  often feature water caltrops (bull horn-shaped roots) as part of the
  fairy diet. The Fairy Mother herself is given peaches on her
  birthdays.  The finger citrons, a kind of fruit, have long
  represented Buddha, owing their resemblance to the shape of Buddha's
  palm.  The combination of associations - with long life, happiness,
  elegance and spiritual peace - heightens the diner's admi- ration of
  the culinary sculptures.
  
  To prepare and cook: 1. For sesame paste filling, stir-fry sesame
  seeds in a dry, heated wok until golden. Set a quarter aside and
  grind rest to powder. 2. Stir-fry flour in a dry wok, over a low
  flame, all slightly yellow.  Then sift it.  Mix all filling
  ingredients together. Place in refrigerator until firm. 3. For doughs
  (made in two batches, one with spinach juice, one with boiling
  water). Heat spinach juice or water. Pour hot liquid into a mixing
  bowl containing wheat starch and glutinous flour. Mix well. Remove
  mixture to a clean working surface and add remaining ingredients one
  a time, working up a smooth texture. 4. For pear shaping, form
  spinach-dyed dough into small balls of approximately 4 g each.
  Flatten round discs.  Do same for uncoloured dough. Place one
  uncoloured disc on top of a dyed dough disc.  Place a small portion
  of sesame paste filling on top, and mould discs upwards around it to
  form pear shape. Stick one dry twiglet into top end of pear shape.
  Press lightly on bottom of pear shape to form a firm base. 5. Steam
  for 3 to 5 minutes. (If shrimp roe not available, chocolate powder
  could be dusted over the pears after they have cooled.) (The water
  caltrop garnish recipe is not included. it is also steamed dough with
  colouring.)

      Title: STEAMED LOTUS BUNS
 Categories: China, Appetizers
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Envelope active dry yeast
      6 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Warm water (100 degrees F.
           -to 110 degrees F.)
  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour, + more
           -for kneading
      1 c  Warm milk (100 degrees F. to
           -110 degrees F.)
      2 ts Baking powder
           Asian sesame oil or
           -vegetable oil
 
  Put yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar into a bowl. Pour in warm
  water, stir, and let mixture stand 5 minutes to dissolve. It should
  foam and bubble. If it does not, discard and use a fresh package of
  yeast.
  
  Put flour and remaining sugar in a food processor fitted with the
  metal blade. Turn machine on for 2 seconds to mix ingredients.
  Combine yeast mixture with warm milk and, while the machine is
  running, pour milk down the feed tube in a steady stream. Process
  until dough forms a rough ball. If the ball is sticky, add flour, 1
  teaspoon at a time, and process a few seconds longer until dough
  pulls away from sides of bowl. Remove dough to a lightly floured
  board.
  
  Knead, dusting with flour until dough is smooth and elastic, about 2
  minutes. Form dough into a ball and put it into a large, lightly
  oiled. mixing bowl. Cover and set in a warm spot. Let rise until it
  doubles in size, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch down dough and turn out on a lightly floured surface. Flatten,
  then put the baking powder in the center. Fold over edges and knead
  until baking powder is thoroughly incorporated. Invert, mixing bowl
  over the dough; let rest 10 minutes.
  
  Divide dough in half. Cover one half, and roll the other half into
  12-inch-long roll; cut into 12 pieces. Remove 1 piece and cover rest.
  Roll the piece into a flat 3 1/2 inch circle. Lightly brush one with
  oil; fold over to form a half moon. With the back of a knife score
  the half-moons crosswise at 1/4-inch intervals.
  
  Then with a chopstick, make an indentation in the middle of the
  rounded edge while the thumb and forefinger pinch the middle of
  straight edge to form a notch and form a leaf. Set on a 3-inch square
  of parchment paper and place in a steaming basket. (You will need 2
  baskets, or you'll need to steam 2 separate batches.) Repeat with
  remaining dough; leave space between buns in the basket.
  
  Let rise for 30 minutes, or until buns almost double in size, then
  steam over boiling water for 15 minutes. When done, let cool for a
  minute before serving.
  
  Makes 24 buns.

  :          recipe egg noodle dough* --
  
  *Recipe is included in this collection. PREPARATION:
       Mix all ingredients  except wonton skins. WRAPPING: Trim off 4
  corners of wonton skins to form circles. Drop 1 tsp. mixture onto
  middle of the skin, gather up skin sides, letting the dough pleat
  naturally. Flatten top and give the middle a light squeeze while
  tapping the bottom on a flat surface so it  will stand upright.
     STEAMING: Arrange dumplings in an 8 inch round cake pan. Set pan
  on the steam rack in the wok. Fill bottom of wok with water. Cover.
  Steam for 15-20 minutes. Serve hot with a sesame oil and soy sauce
  dip. (1 part sesame oil to 2 parts light soy sauce.) DO AHEAD NOTES:
  Steam dumplings. Cool and freeze. Reheat by         s teaming again
  for 12-15 minutes. COMMENTS: Insert         toothpicks for easy
  serving. If you use a bamboo or aluminum steamer, place dumplings
  directly on the rack
     without the cake pan. Steam for the same amount of time. Since
  steamed d umplings can be made ahead and
        reheated in great quantities they make marvelous hors d'oeuvres
  for large cocktail parties. The two-tier aluminum steamer works
  particularly well. Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted for

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Butter, clarified
      2 ts Cardamom, ground
      1 c  Sugar, brown
      2 c  Persimmon pulp
      1 ts Juice, lemon
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
 
  Vegetable oil can be substituted for the clarified butter.
  
  In a large bowl, mix the flower, sugar and soda.  Fold in the pulp
  and the ghee.  Add the lemon juice, cardamom powder, raisins and
  nuts. Stir to combine all the ingredients.
  
  Coat with ghee or oil a six-cup container and pour the mixture into
  it. Cover with foil and steam in the pressure cooker without its
  valve weight for about 1 hours. Cool the halva before cutting into
  small pieces for serving.
  
  A pressure cooker with a six-cup size container works best for this
  recipe. One large persimmon equals about
        1    cup of pulp.

      1 pk Round dumpling skins *
    1/2 lb Prawns
     12    Chinese mushrooms, small or
           - use canned but squeeze dry
    1/2 lb Ground pork
      2    Green onion, finely chopped
      1 sm Egg

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONING------------------------------
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      1 tb Sesame oi
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Oyster sauce
      1 tb Cornstarch
 
  Shell, devein, wash, and drain prawns.  Dice into bits.
  
  Boil mushrooms in water for 10 minutes, rinse, squeeze dry, cut off
  and discard stems; then chop into very small pieces.
  
  Combine the pork, mushrooms, prawns, and onion.  Put mixture on
  chopping board and chop 10 to 15 strokes with cleaver. (Use a sharp
  knife if you don't have a cleaver.) Texture, when you're finished,
  should be slightly finer than hamburger.
  
  Add "seasoning" and the egg to the pork mixture.  Mix well.
  
  To make dumpling, place 1 Tb filling in the center of a dumpling
  skin. Then bring all sides of the skin up to cover the meat as much
  as possible, without closing. The top of the dumpling is left open.
  
  Cook dumplings by steaming for 30 minutes.  Use as many as you need,
  with the rest, cool, wrap, freeze. Reheat after thawing by steaming
  10 minutes.
  
  Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, or mustard.

      Title: STEAMED PORK WITH PRESERVED TIANJIN VEGETABLE
 Categories: Chinese, Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Pork butt, chopped fine
      4    Water chestnuts, coarsely
           -chopped
      1    Green onion, minced
      2 tb Preserved Tianjin vegetable

  1 1/2 ts Dark soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Cornstarch
 
  Fresh pork lends itself well to steaming, either cubed, sliced or
  minced, and combined or topped with "flavoring" ingredients.
  
  Preparation:  Mix marinade. In bowl, mix chopped pork, water chest-
  nuts, 1/2 preserved vegetable, & marinade; mix together with your
  fingers - it's faster.  Spread mixture on round 12" plate.  Sprinkle
  with remaining preserved vegetable.  Refrigerate if working in ad-
  vance.
  
  Steaming:  Bring pork mixture to room temperature before steaming.
  Bring water in steamer to rapid boil. Steam for about 20 minutes.
  Sprinkle with chopped onions just before serving.

      Title: STEAMED PUDDINGS - GROUND BEEF FILLING
 Categories: Beef, British, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 c  Ground beef
      1 ts Celery salt
      1 ts Thyme
           Salt to taste
           Ground black pepper to taste
      1 ts Dark Soya sauce

MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Ground suet
      1 ts White pepper
 
  1. Add meat and filling spices to a large skillet. Cook thoroughly.
  
  2. Discard oils that have been extracted during the cooking process.
  Allow meat to become cold. Using warm or hot meat will adversely
  effect the pastry shell.
  
  3. Thoroughly mix all-purpose flour with suet. Do not use a
  substitute for the suet - the results will not be acceptable. If the
  suet is an extremely fine grind (powdery) use slightly less. The
  consistency should be similar to that used in making Mince-meat. A
  food processor may be utilized in making the dough.
  
  4. Add cold water to the mixture, a little at a time. Continue to
  blend together. A pea-sized consistency will be achieved then dough
  will form into a ball. Allow to stand for 5-10 mins.
  
  5. On a floured surface, roll out the pastry ball to obtain a sheet
  approx 1/4" thick. Make (or find) a circular template that will gauge
  the proper amount of pastry to fit into your pudding form.
  
  Note: pudding forms come in a variety of sizes. Anything that will
  stand up to being steamed, is approximately the size and shape of a
  coffee mug, and has a lid, would be appropriate. Heat-resistent
  plastic steaming cups with snap on covers are best.
  
  6. Use the template to cut 4 pastry shells from the sheet. Gently
  press these shells into the steaming cups so as to cover the bottom
  and sides. Pleat where necessary to follow curve of the cup and allow
  pastry to hang over the sides at the top.
  
  6. Place approx 1/4 of the meat filling into each cup. Press the meat
  down slightly in each cup so as to fill to within 1/4 in. of the top.
  
  7. Re-work remaining pastry. Cut circles of dough slightly smaller
  than the diameter of the snap on lid. This forms the cap of the
  pastry shell. Joined to the pastry shell to the cap by pressed the
  pastry together around the circumference and folding in the hanging
  edges. A slightly thick cap is desired - although great excess should
  be trimmed away. Snap on the lid, and place each steamed pudding into
  the steaming device that you intend to use.
  
  8. Steam for 25-30 minutes. Check at 20 min. to determine degree of
  progress. The pastry should take on a slightly shiney look and be
  firm to the touch when done. Puddings will stand up to overcooking.
  
  9. Serve with a rich beef gravy, chips (french-fries), and peas.
  Reconstituted dried green peas is the traditional vegetable.
  
  Footnote: This recipe orginally contained diced beef and kidney as
  the meat filling. Since few people seem to appreciate the kidney
  ingredient, and considering that minced beef (hamburger meat) is an
  economical alternative, this recipe was developed. The Steak and
  Kidney Pudding is a widely recognized British dish.

           Rice
           Water
 
  This is a fool proof way of cooking any amount of rice.
  
  Wash rice well. Place rice into sauce pan. Add water until it covers
  the rice. To gauge the correct amount of water the water should come
  up to the first joint of the index finger. Boil the rice until the
  rice is at surface level then close the lid and turn the heat down
  low. The rice should be cooked in about 10 minutes or when all the
  water is absorbed. Check periodically.
  
  I use this method but have a rice cooker. No measuring required. With
  the old harder rice add more water.

 Categories: Korean, Vegetarian, Rice
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Rice
      2 c  Water
 
  1.  Pour the rice into a cooking pot. Fill the pot nearly to the brim
  with cold water, then pour the water out. The rice will remain at the
  bottom of the pot. Repeat this process 4 or 5 times, or until the
  water seems quite clear. Rinsing the rice in this manner eliminates
  any excess starch.
  
  2.  Cover the rice with 2 cups water and let it stand for 30 minutes.
  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and steam for 20 minutes or until
  dry.
  
  Generally speaking, if Americans are to be served, use 1/2 cup
  uncooked rice for each person. Double the amount if cooking for
  Koreans, especially Korean men.

      Title: STEAMED RICE CAKE WITH MUNG BEANS
 Categories: Rice, Beans, Korean
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Glutinous rice
      2 c  Skinless yellow mung beans
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Sugar
 
  Nokdoo Ciru Pyun (Steamed Rice Cake with Mung Beans)
  
  If the skinless yellow mung beans are unavailable, you may use the
  green mung beans but they must be skinned before preparing this rice
  cake. Soak them in water to cover for 4 hours. Rub the beans between
  your hands in the water and the skins will separate quite easily.
  Drain, discard the skins, and use the green beans as noted in the
  recipe except that additional soaking is not necessary.
  
  Glutinous rice, also known as sweet rice, is reserved in Asia for
  special occasions, many times for sweets. The rice is dense and gummy
  and can be attractive to western tastes. The Nokdoo has simple
  ingredients, is vegetarian, fat-free and delicious, if
  unconventional, for the tea and coffee hour break.
  
  1. Rinse the rice well, cover with cold water and soak overnight or
  for 12 hours. Drain well and grind in a processor. This will result
  in a dense, sticky paste.
  
  2. Cover the beans well with cold water and soak for 2 hours. Drain.
  Put the beans in a Chinese-style steamer and steam them for 15
  minutes. Grind the beans coarsely in a processor. Mix them with the
  salt and sugar.
  
  3. Wrap a wet kitchen towel (flat, not Turkish weave) over and around
  the perforated steamer tray. Prepare a layered cake on the towel in
  this way: Put down in a round or rectangle shape a layer 1/4-inch
  thick of the ground mung beans. Cover this with 1/2 inch of the
  glutinous rice and cover with another 1/4 inch of the beans. Cover
  the steamer tightly and steam for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Test with a
  toothpick. If the toothpick emerges dry, then the cake is done.
  
  4. Lift out the cake in the towel and carefully turn it upside down
  on a cutting board. Allow the cake to cool somewhat and slice into
  convenient sections while still warm. Serve immediately while fresh
  with tea or coffee.
  
  The cake should be stored in a freeze since it does ferment when
  refrigerator for more than 1 day. Put the cake sections in aluminum or
  plastic trays, cover and freeze. Remove when wanted and rewarm in a
  steamer for 5 to 10 minutes.

      Title: STEAMED RICE COCONUT MILK CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Rice flour
      3 c  Granulated sugar
      3 c  Coconut milk
      1 ts Lemon juice
      1 ts Active dry yeast
      1 ts Water
      1    Wine rice ball, crushed to a
           -powder
 
  Combine 3 tablespoons of the rice flour, 1/4 cup of the coconut milk,
  and 1/2 teaspoon of yeast with the wine rice ball. Cover and allow to
  stand at room temperature for three hours.
  
  Cook 2 1/2 cups of the coconut milk with the sugar just long enough
  to melt the sugar.  Remove from the heat and cool.
  
  After the yeast-rice flour mixture has rested for three hours,
  combine it with the coconut milk-sugar mixture. Mix well, cover, and
  allow to rest at room temperature for another 3 hours. At the end of
  the resting time, combine the mixture with the remaining coconut
  milk, lemon juice, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of yeast, which
  should first be dissolved in the teaspoon of water.  Transfer to
  several small bowls or pans so that the mixture fills it only halfway
  to allow room for expansion. Let stand overnight, at room
  temperature. The following day, steam [using the wet steaming method
  as described on page 36] for 30 minutes.
  
  Serve the cake either hot, cold, or at room temperature.
  
  Note: A wine rice ball can be purchased in Oriental grocery stores.
  They are about the size of a camphor ball, and white. To crush, use a
  rolling pin or a blender.
  
  Steaming
  
  A steamer consists of a pot in which water is boiled and at least two
  more metal inserts or layers that fit directly on the lower pot of
  water, one above the other. These inserts are perforated, allowing
  wet steam to circulate freely through the layers and enabling either
  a large quantity of one food or several different foods to be cooked
  at the same time.

      Title: STEAMED SALMON DINNER FOR TWO
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
      2 ea Unpeeled, red-skinned
           Potatoes (about 1/2 lb)
      2 ea Salmon steaks, (about 6 oz
           Each), 1 inch thick
      4 ea Thin slices of lemon
     24 ea Snow peas, (about 3 oz)
      6 ea Small oyster mushrooms or
           Other fresh mushrooms:
           Optional

MMMMM----------------------ZESTY DILL SAUCE---------------------------
    1/4 c  Light sour cream
      1 tb Reduced-calorie mayonnaise
      1 ea Small green onion, finely
           Chopped.
      2 ts Chopped dill or
    1/2 ts Dried dill weed
      1 ts Dijon mustard
      1 ea Grated peel of one lemon

MMMMM------------------------PREPARATION-----------------------------
 
  Cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/4 inch slices.
  
  Spray a steamer rack, opened flat, with nonstick vegetable cooking
  spray. Place rack in a large saucepan or dome-lidded, deep electric
  skillet. Add water to a depth of 1 to 1 1/4 inches.  Bring to boiling.
  
  Arrange potato slices over one-third of the rack. Cover and steam for
  eight minutes.  Add salmon steaks and top each with two lemon slices.
  Cover and steam for six minutes more. Add snow peas and mushrooms.
  Cover and steam four to five minutes longer or until fish flakes
  easily with fork and vegetables are tender.
  
  Divide onto two dinner plates or arrange on a large serving platter.
  Garnish with fresh dill, if desired. Serve with Zesty Dill Sauce.
  
  Zesty Dill Sauce preparation: In a small bowl, combine all
  ingredients for sauce. Makes about six tablespoons sauce. Nutritional
  information: One tablespoon of the dill sauce contains 30 calories, 3
  grams of fat and 1 milligram of cholesterol.
  
  Cook's Notes:  A 5 1/2 inch collapsible metal steamer, opened flat,
  works well in a large saucepan or deep skillet. When adding foods,
  cover and adjust heat to maintain water at vigorous boil. so the pan
  is filled continuously with steam. Steam can burn so remove the lid
  by tilting it away from your face.  Use hot pads and remove food
  carefully. Check water level when steaming foods that require longer
  cooking times. If necessary, add boiling water to maintain steaming
  process.
  
  Menu suggestion:  Serve with a salad of assorted salad greens (Bibb,
  romaine, curly red or green lettuce) in individual salad bowls. Top
  with cucumber slices and fresh grapefruit segments. Serve the salad
  with your favorite reduced-calorie creamy cucumber or Italian salad
  dressing.

       ** See recipe for Chicken Stock.
  
       If fillets are thicker than 1/2 to 5/8 inch, carefully cut in
  half horizontally (as you would an English muffin). Trim each into a
  neat 4-inch square.
  
       Cut off tops and bottoms of peppers to leave a band about 2
  inches wide; remove seeds and ribs.  Cut two 4-inch long rectangular
  pieces from each.  Cut into 1/8-inch julienne, leaving pieces grouped
  in a neat rectangle.  Place salmon on an oiled steamer tray or plate.
  Use a cleaver or knife blade to transfer pepper rectangles to fish,
  completely covering each fillet.
  
       Scatter bamboo shoots over the fish, then sprinkle with black
  beans, ginger and scallions.  In small bowl, stir together soy sauce,
  chicken stock, white pepper, vegetable oil and sesame oil. Pour
  mixture over.
  
       Steam in covered steamer (making sure that water boils steadily
  but does not boil away) until just cooked through and opaque, 5 to 8
  minutes (timing varies according to thickness of fish). Carefully
  transfer to serving plate, spoon sauce around and serve immediately.

      Title: STEAMED SALMON WITH BLACK BEANS
 Categories: Seafood, Steamer
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1 lb Salmon fillets or steaks
      3 ts Dry Sherry
      1 ts Grated, peeled fresh ginger
    1/4 ts Salt
      1    Garlic clove, pureed
      2 tb Thinly sliced scallions
      1 tb Fermented black beans,
           -coarsely chopped
      1 ts Sesame seed oil
           Cilantro or parsley sprigs,
           -for garnish
 
  Place the fish in a heat-proof dish at least 1" deep. (If you are
  using a fillet, place it skin side down.) Stir together the Sherry,
  ginger, salt and garlic in a small bowl. Pour this mixture onto the
  fish and rub generously on both sides. Let stand at least 15 minutes.
  
  Spread the scallions and beans evenly on top of the dish. Drizzle with
  sesame seed oil.
  
  Bring the water in the steamer to a vigorous boil. Place the dish on
  the steamer tray and cover. Steam about 10 minutes, checking for
  doneness after about 8 minutes. The fish will look opaque and feel
  springy to the touch. It is better to undercook slightly than to
  overcook; the heat in the fish will finish the cooking. Serve
  immediately

 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb Spareribs
      1    Clove garlic, minced fine
      2 tb Salted black beans
      1 tb Fresh ginger, minced
      1 ts Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Sherry
 
  Here's a couple of simple, good recipes that use black bean sauce.
  Just in case you don't know, these black beans are the Chinese
  fermented black beans.  They're extremely salty++and should be rinsed
  before use++ and have a very nice, savory taste that blends well with
  many foods. Very common in Chinese markets and I've seen bottles of
  ready prepared black bean sauce in supermarkets in the Oriental food
  sections.  Just substitute the deep fried tofu cubes for the meat in
  these recipes. One of these recipes is for pork spareribs and one for
  prawns. They'll give you an idea of how the beans are combined with
  the other ingredients to come up with the sauce.
  
  Yield: 4 servings
  
  Preparation:  Have butcher cut spareribs into 1-inch pieces. Trim off
  fat. Place spareribs in a heat proof dish. Wash and rinse black beans
  2 or 3 times, then mash them with garlic, ginger, soy sauce,
  cornstarch and sherry.  Mix with spareribs.
  
  Cooking:  Place heat proof dish on steaming rack in wok. Add water to
  bottom of wok.  Cover.  Steam for
       30    minutes.
  
  Do-ahead notes: Do through preparation.
  
  Comments:  Spareribs can be left in the steamer for 2 hours if dinner
  is late.  Substitute bean sauce for salted black beans++and
  abracadabra! Mein See Jing Pie Quat! (Steamed Spareribs in Bean
  Sauce.)

      Title: STEAMED SPARERIBS WITH BLACK BEANS
 Categories: Oriental, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Pork spareribs
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Finely chopped ginger root
  1 1/2 tb Chinese fermented blk. beans
           -(coarsely chopped)
      2 ts Finely chopped garlic
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
 
  ASK YOUR BUTCHER to cut the spareribs into individual ribs and then
  into 2-inch segments, or do it yourself with a cleaver or a sharp,
  heavy knife. Rub the spareribs with salt and let them sit in a bowl
  for about 20-to-25 minutes. Fill a large saucepan with water and
  bring it to a boil. Turn the heat to low, add the spareribs and
  simmer them for 10 minutes. Drain them and discard the water. Mix the
  other ingredients together in a large bowl and stir in the spareribs,
  coating them well with the mixture. Transfer the mixture to a deep
  plate or dish. Set up a steamer or put a rack into a wok or large
  deep pot. Pour in 2 inches of water. Bring the water to a boil, and
  then reduce the heat. Lower the plate of spareribs carefully into the
  steamer or onto the rack. Cover it with a lid and steam gently for 1
  hour or until the spareribs are very tender. Remember to keep a
  careful watch on the water level, and replenish it with hot water
  when necessary. Skim off any surface fat, and serve. You can make
  this dish ahead of time and reheat the ribs by steaming for 20
  minutes or until they are hot.

      Title: STEAMED STICKY RICE - KHAO NEOW *
 Categories: Thai, Rice
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 c  Sticky Rice
 
  Sticky rice is a glutinous rice eaten by the people of the North and
  Northeast region of Thailand.  The rice is sometimes referred to as
  sweet rice because it has a sweet flavor. It is often used to make
  rice wine and vinegar.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~------------- ~-- Place the rice in a saucepan or bowl and add
  enough water to cover. Rub the rice between your hands several times
  and drain off the milky water. Add clean water and repeat the process
  until the water runs clear.
  
  Soak the rice overnight in enough water to cover or, to save time,
  the rice can be soaked in hot water for 3 hours before steaming,
  rather than overnight.
  
  Drain the rice and place in a cloth-lined steamer or in a steaming
  basket. Place the basket over a pot of boiling water, making sure
  that the basket does not touch the water. Cover the steamer and steam
  for approximately 30 minutes.

 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
    1/2 lb Pork, ground [I minced it
           -with cleavers. S.C.]
      4    Fresh water chestnuts,
           -peeled and finely minced
      1 ts Minced fresh ginger root
      2 tb Minced scallion
  1 1/2 tb Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 tb Thin soy sauce
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
      1 ts Cornstarch
      2 lg Bitter melons, about 3/4 to
           -1 lb.

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 tb Peanut oil
      2 ts Minced garlic
  1 1/2 tb Fermented black beans
      1 tb Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
    3/4 c  Chicken broth
           Salt to taste
    1/2 ts Cornstarch mixed with 1
           -teaspoon cold chicken broth
      1 tb Sesame oil
           From Ken Hom's book,
           -Chinese Technique.
 
  Combine the stuffing ingredients in a large bowl.  Mix them
  thoroughly. The hands are the best tool for this job.
  
  Cut the bitter melon into 1-inch slices; discard the end pieces. With
  a paring knife, trim out the insides. Lift them out. Stuff the cavity
  of each slice with a generous spoonful of stuffing.
  
  Arrange the stuffed pieces of vegetable on a plate and set the plate
  on a trivet in a wok over enough hot water to come within 1 inch of
  the plate. Cover the wok and steam the food for 20 minutes. Remove
  the platter and trivet.
  
  In a separate wok or pan, prepare the sauce.  First heat 2 tablespoons
  peanut oil.  Add the garlic and fermented black beans, stir for a
  minute, then add the Shaoxing wine, chicken stock and salt. Add the
  liquid that results from the steaming of the melon.  Bring the
  mixture to a boil. Thicken with the dissolved cornstarch and flavor
  with sesame oil.
  
  Pour the sauce over the bitter melons and serve.
  
  Serves 2 as a main course.
  
  NOTE:  Hom makes no mention of blanching although another bitter melon
  recipe in another book *does* say that it will cut the bitterness.

 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      6    Dried Chinese black
           -mushrooms
      6 oz Shrimp, shelled and deveined
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
      6 oz Ground pork butt
    1/4 c  Finely diced bamboo shoots
    1/4 c  Finely diced water
           -chestnuts, preferably fresh
      2    Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry
           -sherry
  1 1/2 ts Light soy sauce
      2 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Chicken stock
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           -coriander leaves
 
  These dumplings make great finger food for a cocktail party. They can
  be prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before
  serving. The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture,
  a unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors. Roll
  out the wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.
  
  Wheat Starch Wrappers (see recipe) Vegetable oil Light soy sauce, for
  dipping Chinese mustard, for dipping
  
  Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and
  pliable. Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms. Cut
  off the stems at the base and discard them. Finely mince the caps.
  
  Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes. Rinse well
  with cold water, pat dry thoroughly. Coarsely mince.
  
  Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium-
  high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water
  chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns
  white. Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce.
  Combine the cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix
  until smooth; pour into wok. Stir fry for 1 minute longer. Remove the
  mixture to a shallow plate and mix in the remaining green onion and
  coriander. Allow the filling to cool, then refrigerate it until
  needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
  Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of
  dough. Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch
  circle. An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a
  tortilla press or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the
  edges to seal the filling inside. Repeat with remaining dough and
  filling.
  
  Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate). Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes. Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard.
  Serve with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

      Title: STEAMED TURNIP CAKE
 Categories: Vegetables, Chinese
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 lb Corn starch
      3 c  Water, cold
      6 lb Turnips,
           -peeled and grated
     10 oz Cantonese sausage
           -(about 8 sausages)
    1/2 c  Chinese dried shrimps
      6 tb Cooking oil
      1 ts Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 c  Chicken broth
           -(or use water
           -and bouillon cubes)
    1/2 c  Water
      1 tb Cooking wine
      1 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground pepper
 
  Soak dried shrimps in lukewarm water until softened, drain. Mix well
  the corn starch with about 3 cups of cold water, by hand.
  
  Dice the sausages.  Heat about 2 T of oil in a pan and stir fry the
  sausages and dried shrimps for about 7 mins. Add the soy sauce,
  cooking wine and about 1/2 t sugar. Stir fry for 1 more minute,
  remove from heat, and set aside.
  
  In a large stock pot, heat up about 4 T of oil, the chicken broth,
  about 1/2 cup of water, about 1 T sugar, salt and ground pepper. Add
  the grated turnip and mix well. Cook, covered, over high heat for
  about
       15    minutes.
  
  Grease four 9-inch round cake pans with some shortening.
  
  Add sausages to the cooked turnip mixture and mix well. Then add the
  cornstarch mixture and stir quickly over low heat until it looks
  transparent, about 7 minutes.
  
  Place cake mixture in greased pans and steam over high heat for 1
  hour and 20 mins.
  
  Let the cakes cool completely before cutting.  Cooled cakes can be
  easily taken out of pans upside down. Turnip cakes taste better when
  served warm and topped with soy sauce and a little bit of chili
  sauce. Or they can be cut up into thin slices and pan fried slightly
  with oil before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An easy recipe for Cantonese salty turnip cakes -- We usually make
  this cake in winter time.  I got this recipe originally from a
  magazine in Hong Kong.  It is a new and easy way to make this
  Cantonese specialty. I have tried this recipe on about ten Americans.
  They all like it.
  
  *  If you don't have a steamer, a 16 quart stock pot can be a very
  good steamer.  Any casseroles that can fit in your steamer can be
  used instead of cake pans.
  
  *  Cantonese sausages are usually made with pork cubes. They are made
  by dehydrating the sausages with cold air and are usually available
  in the winter time. The diameter is about the same as American
  breakfast sausages but is about 5 to 6 inches long. The sausages have
  to be cut into very fine cubes so that they mix well with the
  turnips. The cake tastes good partly because of the flavor of the
  sausages. I have never tried anything else. But I think bacon bits
  might be able to mix well with the turnip mixture. Of course, the
  cake will taste different with bacon bits.

 Categories: Chinese, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Whole fish (cleaned weight)
           Rock cod, flounder, pomfret
      2 ts Salt
      4    Scallions
      1 tb Ginger slivers
      1 c  Stock
      1 tb Dry gin
    1/2 ts Sugar
           Cornstarch paste
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1    Sprig Chinese parsley
 
  For more people, use more than one fish.  Each fish should be no more
  than 2 lbs. unless you have a very large steamer. Have your
  fishmonger clean and scale fish, leaving head and fins intact. You
  can tell if fish is fresh by the clearness of the eyes and a red tint
  on the inner edge of the gills. Wash and pat dry, rub with salt.
  Allow to stand at room temperature for
       30    minutes.
  
  On both sides of fish, make parallel diagonal cuts 1" apart through
  meaty section.  Trim and shred scallions diagonally in 2" lengths.
  Peel and shred fresh ginger root. Place pieces of scallion and ginger
  in cuts.
  
  Place fish on greased plate.  Steam at rapid boil for 15 to 25
  minutes, depending on size.  Fish is cooked when you can flake flesh.
  Overcooking will toughen flesh, so watch closely.
  
  Heat peanut oil in beaker or small saucepan.  In wok, heat stock, gin
  and sugar.   When fish is cooked, remove from steamer. Drain juices
  into stock mixture. Thicken slightly with cornstarch paste. Pour hot
  oil, then stock mixture, over fish.  Garnish with Chinese parsley.
  Serve.

      Title: STEGT KYLLING (BRAISED CHICKEN WITH PARSLEY)
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Roasting chicken (to 3.5 lb)
      1 tb Salt
      8 tb Butter; softened
      1 lg Bunch parsley
      2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Heavy cream
 
  Preheat oven to 325øF. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels, then
  rub it thoroughly inside and out with salt. Cream 1/4 pound of butter
  by using an electric mixer set at medium speed or by beating it
  vigoriusly against the side of a bowl with a wooden spoon. With a
  pastry brush and your fingers, spread it inside the chicken. Then
  stuff the chicken with the entire bunch of parsley and truss the bird
  so that it will hold it's shape while cooking. Heat 2 tablespoons of
  butter and the oil over moderate heat on top of stove in a heavy,
  flameproof casserole or roasting pan just large enough to hold the
  chicken comfortably, and put the chicken in breast side down. After
  about 5 minutes, turn the bird on it's side. Try to avoid breaking
  the skin. In another 5 minutes, when this side is sufficiently
  browned, turn the chicken on it's other side for 5 minutes, then
  finally on it's back for 5 minutes or so. The browning of the chicken
  should take about 20 minutes in all. Transfer the chicken to a
  platter and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the casserole.
  In its place add 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, stirring
  vigorously to scrape up any browned bits clinging to the pan. Return
  the chicken to the casserole, breast side up, cover tightly and place
  in over to braise for about 1 hour. To test, lift the chicken upright
  out of the pan with a wooden spoon inserted in the tail opening. If
  the juice that runs out is yellow, the chicken is done; if still
  somewhat pink, cook another 5 to 10 minutes. Place the chicken on a
  carving board and let rest for 5 minutes while you make the sauce.
  Skim and discard fat from the pan juices, add the cream and bring to
  a boil, stirring rapidly and scraping up any browned bits in the
  bottom and sides of the pan. Boil the sauce briskly for several
  minutes until the cream has reduced and the sauce thickens. Taste for
  seasoning adding salt if needed. Serve chicken with sauce in a heated
  sauceboat.

      Title: STEGT RODSPAETTE (SAUT‚ED FLOUNDER W/SHRIMP)
 Categories: Seafood, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Flounder fillets, 1/2 lb ea.
           Salt
           Flour
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs; dried
      2 md Eggs
      2 tb Water
      8 tb Butter (1 stick)
      2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 lb Shrimp; cooked, small,
           -peeled and deveined
           Lemon wedges
 
  "Plaice is the fish the Danes usually prepare in this manner, but
  flounder is an excellent American substitute. Danish shrimp are the
  1" variety similar to U.S. West Coast shrimp. Choose the smallest
  fresh shrimp available." Rince the fish in cold water and pat dry
  with paper towels. Salt lightly, dip in flour and shake off excess.
  Spread the bread crumbs on wax paper. In a mixing bowl beat the eggs
  together with 2 tablespoons of water, then dip each fillet into the
  egg mixture and coat each side thoroughly with the bread crumbs. Let
  them rest for at least 10 minutes before cooking. Heat 2 tablespoons
  of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy 10-12" skillet over
  moderate heat. Add the shrimp and toss them in the butter for 2 to 3
  minutes until well coated. Place a line of the shrimp down the center
  of each fillet. Melt the remaining butter over low heat until it
  turns a rich, nutty brown, pour over the fish fillets and garnish
  with lemon wedges. If you prefer, serve with a parsley sauce (see
  recipe) in place of the shrimp and brown butter.

      Title: STEKT MARINERT MAKRELL (GRILLED MARINATED MAC
 Categories: Norwegian, Seafood, Main dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Salt
           Black pepper, fresh ground
      2 ts Onion; finely chopped
      2    Mackerel (1 lb each)
  1 1/2 tb Butter; melted
  1 1/2 tb Oil (combine w/butter)
 
  Remove the backbones from the fish without cutting them in half, or
  have your fish dealer remove them. Preheat broiler. In a shallow
  baking dish large enough to hold the fish laid out flat in one layer,
  combine the oil, lemon juice, salt, black pepper and onions. Place
  the mackerel in this marinade, flesh side down for 15 minutes, then
  turn them over for another 15 minutes. Brush the broiler grill with 1
  tablespoon of melted butter and oil and place the mackerel on it,
  skin side down. Grill only one side about 3" from heat, basting from
  time to time with remaining butter and oil. In 10 to 12 minutes they
  should have turned a light golden color and their flesh should flake
  easily when prodded with a fork. Serve at once, accompanied by
  butter-steamed new potatoes and tomato or horse-radish butter. (See
  recipes.)

    1/2 c  Warm water (105-110 degrees)
      2 pk Active dry yeast
      2 tb Granulated sugar
  3 1/2 oz Pkg instant vanilla pudding
    1/2 c  Butter, melted
      2    Eggs, beaten
      1 ts Salt
      8 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Butter, melted

MMMMM----------------------CINNABON TOPPING---------------------------
      2 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
      4 ts Cinnamon

MMMMM-----------------OR* CREAM CHEESE FROSTING----------------------
      8 oz Cream cheese, softened
    1/2 c  Butter, softened
      1 ts Vanilla
      3 c  Powdered sugar
      1 tb Milk, just enough to fluff

MMMMM-----------------OR* STICKY BUNS & TOPPING----------------------
      1 c  Butter
      1 c  Brown sugar
      9 tb Light corn syrup
      1 c  Pecans or walnuts,
           - coarsely chopped
 
  BUNS:In small bowl, combine water, yeast and sugar. Stir until
  dissolved. Set aside. In large bowl, make pudding mix according to
  package directions. Add butter, eggs and salt; mix well. Add the
  yeast mixture; blend. Gradually add flour and knead until smooth,
  adding "sprinkles" of flour as needed to control stickiness. Once the
  dough is no longer sticky and is soft and silky feeling (like as
  baby's behind), the dough is ready. Place in very large greased bowl.
  Cover and let rise until double in bulk (about 1 hour). Punch down
  and let rise again (about 45 minutes). On a lightly floured surface,
  roll out to a 34" x 21" rectangle. Spread 1 cup of melted butter over
  surface. CINNABON TOPPING: In small bowl, mix brown sugar and
  cinnamon together. Sprinkle all over top of surface. Roll up very
  tightly. With a knife, put a notch every 2 inches. With string or
  thread, place under roll by notch and criss-cross over to cut roll
  (makes a nice clean cut). Place on greased baking pan, 2-inches
  apart. Lightly press rolls down with your hands (just a LITTLE, it
  helps to hold them together better). Cover and let rise until double
  again. Bake at 350-degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. Take them out when
  they JUST start to turn golden. DON'T OVER-BAKE!  Frost warm rolls
  with Cream Cheese Frosting. CREAM CHEESE FROSTING: Combine all
  ingredients and mix until smooth. Spread on very warm rolls. Rolls
  are best when served warm. CARAMEL STICKY BUNS & TOPPING: In a sauce
  pan or in your microwave oven combine butter, brown sugar and corn
  syrup.  Heat and stir until blended. Pour topping into the bottom of
  the pan (pans) you are using for the rolls, place unbaked cinnamon
  rolls on top on the caramel sauce. Allow to rise in a warm place
  until double in size (about 1 hour). Preheat oven to 350-degrees.
  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly brown. After removing pans
  from oven, cover with foil; invert onto cooling racks, cool 1 minute,
  and remove pan. Cool before serving.

      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce

           -- to taste
      1 tb "Fine spices" mixture

MMMMM-----------------------MADEIRA GLAZE----------------------------
      1 c  Beef stock
      1 tb Unflavored gelatin
           -- packaged
    1/3 c  Madeira wine or dry sherry

MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
           Carved radish or tomato
           -flowers
           Small parsley leaves

MMMMM-------------------------VARIATIONS------------------------------
      1 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts or
      1 c  Coarsely chopped pistachios
 
  The author writes: "This food processor recipe makes about 4 lbs. -
  enough pate to pack into crocks for holiday gifts your friends will
  enjoy. The amount of butter can be reduced for a less expensive
  version, but it won't be as smooth. Do not use margarine.  If you
  don't have homemade chicken stock, use a bouquet garni to enhance the
  instant kind. In place of prepared "fine spices," you may substitute
  a pinch each of white pepper, red pepper, mace, sage, marjoram,
  rosemary, cinnamon, nutmeg and tarragon."
  
  For bouillon "stock," bring water to boil with chicken cubes. In a
  cheesecloth bag, tie parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns and thyme; place
  in stock.  Simmer for 20 minutes. Remove bag and discard.
  
  For pate:  Marinate liver in cream for 8 hours or overnight in
  refrigerator.  Rinse liver in cold water several times; cover with
  fresh cold water and bring to the boiling point. Immediately drain
  water, fill with fresh cold water and bring to boil again.  Repeat
  procedure twice more.  (This removes bitter taste.)
  
  Now add chicken stock to cover liver and bring to boiling point. Turn
  down to simmer and cook 20 minutes. If time allows, let liver cool in
  the stock. Drain well.
  
  Finely chop onions in food processor.  Saute the onions in some of the
  butter until transparent but not colored. In a very large mixing bowl,
  blend all ingredients except the fine spices with liver and remaining
  butter.
  
  Place batches of this mixture in food processor and process until very
  smooth.  Repeat as needed.  Add fine spices; taste and adjust
  seasonings. Some salt may be required. (When tasting warm, the
  seasonings are more acute than when cold.  So add a bit more to
  achieve desired taste.) Taste for cognac and brandy; adjust
  accordingly.
  
  Pack into well-buttered or oiled molds; gently tap to release any air
  pockets. Cover with foil; refrigerate. To unmold, immerse to half
  their depth in hot water, counting 10 seconds, then invert onto a
  platter. Garnish with carved flowers of radishes or tomatoes, if
  desired. Or spoon pate into a piping bag and squeeze out in swirls
  onto crackers or toasted bread rounds. Garnish each with a tiny
  parsley leaf.
  
  To store several weeks, pour melted butter completely over top of
  pate in mold.  Cover with foil; refrigerate. To serve, remove and
  discard hardened butter from top and unmold as above.
  
  To glaze with Madeira: Heat beef stock and add packaged, unflavored
  gelatin.  Allow to dissolve and add Madeira wine or dry sherry. Set
  aside to thicken slightly. With a pastry brush, paint glaze all over
  unmolded pate.  Several coats may be required for an even glaze. Or
  pour glaze gently over pate by setting pate on a rack over a plate
  (to catch the overflow).
  
  To vary, fold in walnuts or pistachios after blending pate
  ingredients in food processor.  Then add the fine spices and taste.
  
  Yield:  About 4 lbs., or enough for a cocktail party of 16.

      Title: STEPHANIE'S RAISIN SCONES
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Wedges
 
      2 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
      8 tb (1 stick) cold unsalted
           -butter, cut up
      1 c  Raisins
      2 tb Sugar
      1    Yolk of a large egg
    3/4 c  Buttermilk or plain yogurt
      1    White of a large egg
           Additional sugar for
           -sprinkling
 
  1. Heat oven to 375F. Put flour, baking powder, soda, nutmeg, and
  salt into a large bowl. Stir to mix well. Add butter and cut in with
  a pastry blender or rub in with your fingers, until the mixture looks
  like fine granules. Add raisins and sugar; toss to distribute evenly.
  
  2. Add egg yolk to buttermilk in a measuring cup and whisk with a
  fork to blend. Pour over the flour mixture and stir with a fork until
  a soft dough forms.
  
  3. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and give 10-12
  kneads. Cut dough in half. Knead each half briefly into a ball; turn
  smooth side up and pat into a 6 inch circle. Cut in 6 wedges, but do
  not separate wedges.
  
  4. In a small bowl, beat the egg white with a fork until just broken
  up. Brush to top of each scone with the egg white, and sprinkle
  lightly with sugar. With a pancake turner, carefully transfer the two
  cut circles to an ungreased cookie sheet. If necessary, reshape
  circles so that the 6 wedges in each are touching. This will keep the
  raisins from burning. 5. Bake 18-22 minutes or until medium brown.
  Cool on a wire rack. After 5 minutes pull the wedges apart and cover
  loosely with a dish towel.
  
  Note: Egg white and sugar can be added before freezing the unbaked
  scones.
  
  VARIATION: Coarse Whole-Wheat Raisin Scones: Replace 1 cup all-
  purpose flour with 1 cup whole-wheat flour, and add 1/2 cup miller's
  bran to the flour mixture. Omit nutmeg.

  Meanwhile in a large kettle, mix together the tomato sauce, green
  chilies and tomatoes and heat over low heat. When the hamburger is
  done, mix in with tomato sauce mixture. Add the spices, salt and
  sugar, stir well, and adjust ingredients to taste. It will taste
  hotter later than it does now.
  
  Simmer for about 1.5 hours, and then add beans and pepperoni. Simmer
  for 30 minutes longer. Serve over rice, topped with shredded cheddar
  cheese.

  1 1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
      2    Eggs
      2 ts Vanilla extract
  2 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 lb Chocolate chips
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream butter and sugar in a mixing
  bowl until creamy. Spend some time and make sure it is well mixed.
  Add eggs and vanilla and mix well. Add flour and soda, again mixing
  well. Add chocolate chips. If it doesn't look like enough, then add
  some more.
  
  Make big, thick cookies, big enough so that you get only 2 dozen of
  them out of this recipe. Put them on a lightly-greased baking sheet.
  Put the cookies in the oven, close the door quickly, and turn the
  heat down to 350 degrees F. Bake for 10 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rich, thick, crunchy chocolate chip cookies. Yield: makes 2 dozen.
  
  *  The use of real ingredients instead of imitation ingredients
  cannot be overemphasized. Chocolate-flavored chips, margarine,
  vanilla flavoring and other such atrocities will completely destroy
  this recipe. I use Challenge butter and Ghirardelli chocolate.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have a machine that can cream sugar and
  butter, moderate otherwise.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking, 10 minutes
  cooling. : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      2    Garlic cloves,  minced
      2 ts Seasoned salt (or use
           -a mixture of salt,
           -pepper, cayenne and
           -celery seed)

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      8 oz Canned mushroom soup
           -concentrate (use the
           -rest of the can)
      3 oz Mushrooms, sliced
    1/2 c  Sour cream
    1/4 c  Drippings (from
           -baking the loaf)
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Mix all ingredients together well,
  shape into loaf and put into a pan. If you use a roasting rack
  instead of a bread pan, the loaf will be less greasy and you can use
  some of the drippings to make the sauce. Bake 20 minutes uncovered at
  425 degrees F. Turn down the oven to 375 degrees F. and continue
  baking, uncovered, for 55 more minutes.
  
  MAKE THE SAUCE:  Fry the mushrooms in the drippings and then combine
  the drippings and mushrooms with the mushroom soup and sour cream.
  Heat this mixture in a sauce pan. When meatloaf is done, put on a
  plate, cover with sauce, slice and eat.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick and flavorful meat loaf -- This is my own adaptation of a
  recipe I got many years ago from a Campbell's soup cookbook. It
  usually gets rave reviews from guests. Yield: serves 4-6.

      2 ts Safflower oil
    1/4 c  Brandy
      3 c  Dry red wine
      1 c  Defatted Beef Stock

  minutes. Set aside.
  
  4. Remove beef from sauce and keep warm on a platter in the oven.
  Bring sauce to a boil and reduce to half its volume by simmering,
  uncovered, for 10 minutes. Combine together remaining olive oil and
  flour and drop into boiling sauce by spoonfuls, stirring with a whisk
  until sauce thickens.
  
  5. Return beef to sauce, and add onions and mushrooms. Heat through

 Categories: Fruits, Breakfast
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
MMMMM----------------STEWED FIGS WITH VARIATIONS---------------------
 
  The easiest and most popular method of preparing California figs is by
  stewing -- and there are many delightful variations on this delicious
  theme. Rinse and drain figs, cover generously with water, cover the
  pan, and cook slowly over low heat for 35 minutes. Add sugar if you
  wish after cooking.
  
  To vary:
  
  Add a half-slice of orange for every six figs.  Simmer five minutes
  more. Serve room warm.
  
  Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice for every four or five figs, with a piece
  of lemon rind.  Simmer five minutes more. Serve either warm or
  chilled.
  
  Add 1 teaspoon California sherry for every six figs, after figs are
  thoroughly cooked.  Chill before serving.
  
  Add either a piece of gingerroot or stick of cinnamon to cook slowly
  with figs.
  
  Stewed figs will keep very well in the refrigerator for use at
  breakfast, as a meal-starter, or as a healthful and delicious dessert.

 Categories: Crockpot, Desserts, Fruits, Harned 1994
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 lb Prunes; pitted
      8 oz Dried apricots
      8 oz Dried pears
      3 c  ;Water
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2    Vanilla bean
      2    Lemon zest strips, 2" each
      2 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice
 
  Stir all ingredients together in a large heavy saucepan. Bring the
  liquid to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to as
  low as possible and cook, covered, until the fruit is softened and
  tender, 2 hours. Stir the fruits occasionally while they cook.
  
  If you have a crockpot, stir all the ingredients together in it and
  cook until the fruit is tender, 6 to 8 hours.
  
  Serve the fruit warm or at room temperature.
  
  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
  
  Loomis says that the crockpot method is preferable, for depth of
  flavor. She suggests serving this as brunch by itself, over waffles
  or pancakes, or for dessert over vanilla or cinnamon ice cream. Or,
  eat this on its own for a sweet snack.

      Title: STEWED MUSHROOMS & QUEENS
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Mushrooms
    1/2 lb Queens (bay scallops)
    1/4 pt Milk
    1/4 pt Single cream or jersey milk
           Tarragon vinegar
           Anchovy essence
      1 sm Bay leaf
           Fresh parsley
  1 1/2 tb Butter
  1 1/2 tb Flour
           Fried breadcrumbs
           -OR Triangles of fried bread
 
  Slice the mushrooms thickly.  Put them into a pan with the cold milk
  (and cream if using).  Three-quarters cover the pan and bring quickly
  to a fast simmer.
   Add the bay leaf and a little salt and reduce the heat to very low.
  Three-quarters cover the pan again and leave to stew gently for 5-6
  minutes.  Strain to separate the liquid from the mushrooms, discard
  the bay leaf and keep the mushrooms warm in a very low oven. Make a
  smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour and creamy mushroom cooking
  liquor. Stir in at least 1/2 teaspoon each tarragon vinegar and
  anchovy essence. Leave to simmer for 2-3 minutes then season to taste
  with salt and pepper. Quickly stir in the queens and immediately
  reduce heat to low. Half cover the pan and cook for just 5 minutes.
  Stir occasionally during this time and be sure to keep the heat very
  low - only a very occasional bubble should break the surface of the
  sauce or the shellfish may toughen. Draw the pan away from the heat,
  quickly stir in the mushrooms and check seasoning. Then turn the
  contents of the pan into a warmed gratin dish (or divide it between
  warmed scallop shells for an elegant first course). Sprinkle with
  parsley and garnish with fried crumbs or triangles of fried bread.
  Serve alone as a first course, or as a main course accompanied by
  some green beans and a little rice or a loaf of warm French bread.
  Serves 2 as a greedy feast, 3 as a main course, or 6 as an appetizer.

      Title: STEWED TOMATOES WITH POTATO PEASANT PURSES
 Categories: Main dish, Cyberealm
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
           STEWED TOMATOES
      1 md Yellow onion
      1 sm Red or yellow pepper
      1    Stalk celery
      2 tb Canola oil
      3 lb Ripe tomatoes, coarsely chop
      7    Sprigs fresh parsley
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar
           Juice of 2 lemons
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
           PEASANT PURSES
      6 lg Cabbage leaves (savoy)
      1 md Yellow onion, chopped
    1/3 c  Butter
    1/2 c  English peas
      2 tb Water
      3 c  Mashed potatoes
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
           Salt and pepper to taste
     12    Green chives
 
  Chop the onion, bell pepper and celery into 1/2 inch pieces. In a
  large stainless steel pot, saute the vegetables in the oil over
  medium heat until translucent.  Peel, seed and chop the tomatoes (I
  just core them and put them in the blender so we get the vitamins
  from the skins). Add tomatoes and parsley to the vegetables and cook
  covered over low heat for 20 minutes.  Remove parsley sprigs.  Season
  with 1/4 cup brown sugar, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Cook for 10
  minutes longer and taste for seasoning.  Add more sugar or salt, to
  taste. Keep warm until ready to serve.  (At this point, I added a
  small amount of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.)
  
  In a 2-quart pot of boiling water, blanch the cabbage leaves until
  wilted; drain and cool.  In a saute pan over medium heat, sweat the
  onion in butter.  Add peas and water, cover for 2-3 minutes. Remove
  cover and cool slightly.  Meanwhile, in a large bowl, blend the
  mashed potatoes with eggs. Stir in the onion and pea mixture. Salt
  and pepper generously. Flatten a cabbage leaf, cutting out any thick,
  unpliable stem. Place a generous 1/2 cup of potato mixture in the
  center of two leaves laid to overlap. Pull the leaves together,
  forming a pouch and tie with 2 chives. Just before serving, reheat
  the pouches for approximately 15 minutes in a steamer or a shallow
  pan of boiling water. Place each pouch on a plate covered with the
  warm stewed tomatoes.
  
  These purses go nicely with grilled English-style sausages or
  bratwurst. A sprinkling of grated cheddar cheese on top is a perfect
  complement to this dish. The flavors of the potatoes, cabbage and
  stewed tomatoes are as rustic as the presentation of this dish.

  ITALIAN SALAD: (Italiensk Salat)
  
  Mix together cooked diced carrots, finely cut asparagus, small peas
  and mayonnaise.  If home-made mayonnaise is used, add a few drops of
  tarragon vinegar just before stirring in the vegetables.
  
  Press a lettuce leaf as tightly as possible on buttered bread and put
  a thick layer of Italian salad on top; decorate with tomato slices
  and cress.
  
  TOMATO AND EGG:  (Tomat og Aeg)
  
  On one half of a piece of buttered bread place slices of hard boiled
  egg. On the other half arrange slices of tomato. Garnish with cress.
  
  TOMATO WITH RAW ONION:  (Tomat med raa Loq)
  
  Top the buttered bread with several slices of tomato and put a pile of
  finely chopped, raw onions in the center.
  
  ROAST BEEF AND FRIED EGG:  (Bof med Spejlaeg)
  
  Place tender slices of cold roast beef on buttered bread. Fry onions
  in deep fat until brown and crisp and spread a layer of these on each
  slice of beef.
  
  Top with fried eggs and serve before the egg cools. (Danish fried
  eggs are never turned).
  
  RAW BEEF AND EGG:  (Tartar med Aeg)
  
  Scrape a piece of raw beef, preferably very fresh, off the sinews
  with a sharp knife and put a 1/2 inch layer on a piece of buttered
  bread. Make a hollow in the center of the meat, circle it with a ring
  of raw onion, and place a raw egg yolk in the center.  Put small
  piles of raw, chopped onions, shredded horseradish, capers, and
  pickles at each end.
  
  HAM AND SCRAMBLED OR FRIED EGG:  (Skinke nied Roraeg eller Spejlaeg)
  
  Butter the bread and spread it with a piece of lean boiled ham. Top it
  either with a strip of scrambled egg, sprinkled with finely cut
  chives, or with a freshly fried, warm egg.
  
  HAM, PIGEON BREAST AND MUSHROOMS:  (Skinke med Duebryst)
  
  Butter a piece of dark rye bread and top with a good sized slice of
  ham. Add 1/2 or whole pigeon's breast cut nicely off the breastbone,
  and top the whole thing with stewed mushrooms and a thin slice of
  homemade liver paste.
  
  LIVER PASTE 1:  (Leverpostej 1)
  
  Put 1 lb. liver through the grinder together with 2 onions. Put 1 lb.
  fat pork twice through the grinder. Mix fat and liver with 1
  tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon pepper. Put in a fireproof dish and
  bake in a slow oven for 1 hour.  The paste must not become too dark
  on top.
  
  Put thick layers of cold paste on buttered bread.  In winter the
  Danes put slices of pickled cucumber and strips of jellied consomme
  on top, and in summer a small dish of fresh cucumber salad is served
  so that you can put some of this on top yourself.  Don't do it until
  the last minute, however, or both cucumber and liver paste may become
  soggy.

  Someone wanted a blue cheese vinaigrette recipe a while back. I
  really like this one, which comes from a nifty little recipe book I
  got for subscribing to Bon Appetit a year or two ago. It calls for
  stilton but I use whatever blue cheese (gorgonzola, Roquefort) comes
  to hand or seems most affordable at the time.

  I belong to the school that feels that a meal isn't a meal unless
  there's meat involved, but this looks like a satisfying vegetarian
  dish. Use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock if you're adamant
  about avoiding animal products.
  
  The article says that for cooking purposes, lotus roots can be
  treated as potatoes and talks about the Japanese using them in
  tempura dishes and coming up with an "exotic potato chip". Sounds
  good to me! In 2 separate bowls, cover dried black mushrooms and tree
  ears with water until soft and pliable (about 30 minutes). Rinse and
  squeeze out excess water from both mushrooms.  Remove and discard
  stems from black mushrooms; cut caps in half and set aside.  Pinch
  off and discard hard center from tree ears; tear large pieces in half
  and set aside.
  
  Rinse lotus root with cold water.  Trim and discard both ends of the
  bulb. With a vegetable peeler, peel the skin. Cut bulbs in half
  length- wise. Lay flat and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices;
  set aside.
  
  Plunge slices into acidulated water.  Drain.
  
  Over medium-high heat preheat wok until hot.  Add oil and tilt wok to
  coat sides.  Add salt, ginger and garlic; stir-fry until fragrant.
  
  Add onions; stir-fry for 15 seconds or until they begin to wilt. Add
  black mushrooms, lotus root, tree ears, water chestnuts and snow
  peas; stir-fry for about 2 minutes or until snow peas turn bright
  green.
  
  Sprinkle in the sugar, white pepper, and soy sauce; toss a few
  seconds.
  
  Splash the chicken stock against sides of hot wok and use to deglaze
  sides. Cover, reduce to medium heat; cook for 30 seconds. Remove
  cover, dribble in the sesame oil Serve hot.
  
  Serves 8.

   Add salt, then scallions, and stir-fry until translucent.
    Add pork; stir-fry until it loses its pinkness (2 to 3 minutes).
  Then sprinkle with soy sauce and sugar and blend in. 4. Add celery,
  onion, and mushrooms; stir-fry 2 minutes more. 5. Add stock and heat
  quickly. Cook, uncovered, another 2 to 3 minutes over medium heat.
  then combine with Soft-fried or tossed noodles, as indicated below.
  
   VARIATIONS: Shred the pork and vegetables.  Omit the stock and
  additional cooking in step 5.
  
   Chinese noodles are distinguised not only by their constituents but
  by the way they're prepared. The noodles can be cooked, mixed,
  blended, and combined with just about every variety of meat, seafood,
  and vegetable. They can be added to soup, either alone, or with
  various toppings..etc etc
  
   LO MEIN means "tossed or mixed noodles" and calls for parboiled
  noodles (also previously drained dry and chilled) to be added, not to
  the hot oil and soft- fried as in CHOW MEIN, but directly to the meat
  and vegetable combinations, which have already been stir-fried. These
  noodles, tossed or mixed and heated through with the cooked
  combinations, are moister, having more of a sauce than the CHOW MEIN.

      Title: STIR FRIED PORK SLICES IN WINE SAUCE
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ts Rice wine vinegar
      3    Cloves garlic -- minced
      2 tb Sherry
      2    Egg yolks
    3/4 c  Chicken stock
      1 ts Water
           Cornstarch paste
      1 c  Bread crumbs -- plain
  1 1/2 lb Pork loin -- boneless
      3 tb Peanut oil
           PASTE-----
      2 tb Cooked rice
      2 tb Soy sauce -- dark
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Warm water
      1 ts Baker's yeast -- dry
      1 ts Wet bean cheese
 
  Prepare Paste:  Use mortar and pestle to pulverize cooked rice.
  Combine with sugar, yeast, soy and warm water. Let stand in warm
  place for 30 minutes to activate yeast. Authentic wine lees paste is
  not available in the U.S. to our knowledge, this is the best
  substitute we have found. You can add wet bean cheese for a sharper
  flavor.
  
  Braise Pork:  Slice pork butt across the grain into strips, 1" by 3"
  by 1/2" thick. Heat peanut oil in wok until it begins to smoke. Add
  some of pork to hot oil; stir-fry pieces until they lose their
  pinkness; repeat in batches until all pork is browned.  Next, add
  garlic to wok; stir briefly. Pour in wine lees paste, rice vinegar,
  sherry and stock; bring to slow boil; add pork slices. Reduce heat,
  cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
  
  Remove pork, without sauce, to large platter.  Cool pork. Cooling is
  essential so that it will deep-fry properly. Reserve sauce in small
  pan. You can hold pork for several hours, if you wish to braise it in
  advance.
  
  Deep-fry Pork:  Heat deep-frying oil in wok.  While oil is heating,
  beat egg yolks with water; set out bread crumbs on platter. Dip pork
  pieces in egg mixture, then bread crumbs, to thoroughly cover.
  
  When oil is at deep-frying temperature, 375 degrees, slip in a slice
  of pork as a test: pork should lightly brown in about 1 minute. Place
  6 pork slices on Chinese strainer, and lower into oil, strainer and
  all. Check in 2 minutes (browning should take slightly longer than
  test because strainer cools the oil). If you prefer to fry in larger
  batches, use more oil. Remove fried pork to warm platter, uncovered.
  
  Finish:  Reheat sauce, and pour over pork just before serving.

  "A few years ago, the Chinese restaurant in the Amarin Hotel served
  this dish which I copied.  The Amarin Hotel was a small hotel with
  personalized services and very popular with many regular guests. I
  worked for a short time at the dress shop there.  The Amarin Hotel is
  no more, there is a big modern shopping plaza in its place now. The
  shopping plaza has the first Macdonald Hamburger outlet in Thailand
  situated there. It is doing very well.  I still miss the Amarin."
  
  Marinate beef with salt and nam pla for 1 hour.  Heat frying pan and
  cook the salted beef (without oil) for 5 minutes. Remove and drain on
  paper towel.  Heat the oil in a wok over high heat to fry the salted
  beef strips until crisp.  Drain oh paper towel.  Heat the remaining
  oil.
  
  Stir-fry hot chili, shredded celery and green onion for 1 minute. Add
  fired crispy beef.  Season with Maggi sauce. Pour onto serving plate.

      1 c  Water
      1 c  Basic Chicken Stock
      1 tb Light or dark soy sauce
    1/2 lb Pork shoulder, in one piece
    1/4 lb Squid, cleaned and cut up
    1/4 lb Raw shrimp in the shell
      2 tb Oil or lard

      1 tb Oil
      4 oz Thick rice sticks (see
           -Note), soaked and drained
      2 c  Bean sprouts
    1/4 c  Chinese chives or garlic
           -chives, cut into 1-inch
           -lengths
 
  This is a favorite street snack among the Chinese in many Southeast
  Asian cities. Hokkien is the local pronunciation of Fujian (Fukien)
  province in southeast China, the origin of many Chinese emigrants
  over the years. In a typical noodle-vendor's stand, the pork and
  shellfish are cooked in a stock that simmers for hours, picking up
  more flavor all the time. In this home version, the extra flavor
  comes from reducing the stock after cooking the meats.
  
  1. In a small saucepan combine water, stock, soy sauce, and pork.
  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until meat is tender. Remove
  meat and set aside. Return stock to a boil. Add squid and cook 30
  seconds. Remove and set aside. Cook shrimp 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and
  set aside, reserving stock. Peel shrimp and devein if necessary. (For
  additional flavor, add shrimp shells to stock and simmer 10 minutes
  longer.)
  
  2. Bring stock to a boil and reduce by half. Strain stock. (The
  recipe may be prepared to this point several hours ahead.)
  
  3. Slice pork into bite-sized pieces. In a wok or large skillet, heat
  oil or lard and garlic to near smoking. Remove and discard garlic
  cloves when they brown. Add noodles and rice sticks and stir-fry
  until they are lightly browned in places. Add stock, cover, and cook
  2 minutes. Remove cover, add pork, squid, shrimp, and bean sprouts,
  and continue stirring and cooking until noodles have absorbed' most
  of the liquid, about two minutes. @1'transfer to serving platter and
  garnish with Chinese chives.
  
  Serves 4 with other dishes.
  
  Note: The authentic rice noodle for this dish is a thicker rice stick
  called laifen in China and pancit luglug in the Phil- ippines, but
  ordinary thin rice sticks may be used.

      3 tb Corn Or Peanut Oil
  1 1/4 ts Kosher Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar, (Or More If Desired)
      2 ts Oriental Sesame Oil
 
  In a large covered saucepan, bring 2 to 2-1/2 quarts of unsalted
  water to a boil over high heat.  Discard any straggly spinach leaves
  and white roots, then use scissors to cut stems and large leaves into
  2-inch sections. Cut bulky stem clusters and any red root tips
  intact. In large bowl, plunge cut spinach into several changes of
  cold water, gently pumping up and down to remove grit.  Drain in
  colander and shake off excess water. Plunge spinach into boiling
  water. After 1 minute, drain spinach in colander, flush with cold
  running water until chilled, then press lightly with palms of hands
  to remove excess water.  Fluff spinach gently to loosen mass. In
  medium-size bowl, cover bean threads with 3 to 4 cups of heated
  water, without removing binding of rubber bands or strings. If bean
  threads are from Taiwan or Thailand, use hot water; if they are from
  the People's Republic of China, use boiling water. When pliable,
  after about 10 seconds use scissors to cut through loop ends or
  center of skein, thereby cutting bean threads into manageable 4- to
  5-inch lengths. Cut rubber bands or strings and discard them, then
  swish bean threads to disperse in water. After another 10 to 15
  seconds, when bean threads are firm - like rubber bands to the touch

  heat until hot enough to evaporate a bead of water on contact. Add
  oil, swirl to coat pan, then reduce heat to medium-high. When hot
  enough to sizzle a bit of spinach on contact, add spinach and toss
  briskly another minute. Add noodles and, using spatula, blend with
  several quick stirs until heated through.  Add sesame oil, toss
  briskly to combine, then remove from heat. Arrange several
  rosy-tipped spinach stems on top, if desired, and serve at once.

      4 tb Shoyu (or soy sauce)
      2 tb Balsamic Vinegar
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1    To 2 cloves garlic crushed,
           Or chopped very fine
      1 tb Freshly grated ginger root

MMMMM-------------------------VEGETABLES------------------------------
        x  Onion
        x  Green pepper
        x  Carrots
        x  Brocolli
        x  Mushrooms
        x  Water chesnuts
        x  Cornstarch
 
  I Use my wok as a steamer, really.  I add onion, green pepper,
  carrots, and brocolli all at the same time and stir-fry until the
  onions get limp, just with the oil that I 'cured' the wok with last
  time I washed it, that is I do not add any.  Then I add about 3/4 cup
  of water or broth and cover. The steam cooks the veggies quickly, you
  can increase the water for softer veggies, or decrease for crunchier
  ones, but cook until all of the liquid is gone.  I then add a can of
  water chestnuts and mushrooms along with the marinade mixture and
  stir-fry for a few minutes to cook the mushrooms and heat the
  chestnuts.  Add about 3/4 teaspoon of cornstarch, and cook for a
  minute or so, mix and serve over really good rice. The cornstarch
  thickens the marinade and makes it cling to the veggies better.
  
  I love the sweet-sour taste of this marinade, another nice addittion
  is to add a can of chunked pineapple, It tastes great and is unusual.
  
  Good luck to all stir-fryers and thank you all for your support.

      Title: STIR-FRIED BOK CHOY IN GARLIC OIL
 Categories: Oriental, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 tb Peanut oil
      1 ts Salt
      4    Garlic cloves
           - lightly crushed & peeled
  1 1/2 lb Bok choy
           - cut into 1-in pieces
 
  HEAT THE WOK over a high flame for 1 minute. Add the oil, and when
  the oil is very hot (this will take just a few seconds; pass your
  hand over it to feel the heat, or look for a wisp of smoke), add the
  salt, garlic and bok choy. A common mistake is to skimp on oil in
  stir-frying vegetables, which makes them dry out and burn. Use enough
  oil to coat the vegetables thinly but thoroughly. This may be
  prepared in advance and served cold.

      1    Clove garlic, finely chopped
      1 sm Carrot, julienne cut

  * stem, seeds and membrane removed, chopped (see note) ** seeds and
  membranes removed, julienne cut (see note) *** stems removed,
  thoroughly washed and drained (4 cups)
  
  This recipe comes from the Stonehouse Restaurant at San Ysidro Ranch
  in California. It's an example of how executive chef Gerard Thompson
  combines ingredients, flavors and textures of diverse ethnic origins.
  
  To make sauce: Combine black beans, chicken stock, ginger, garlic,
  chile and vinegar in a medium-size saucepan and bring to a boil over
  medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until beans are
  tender, about 1 hour. Pour into blender or food processor, add the
  salt and blend until smooth.
  
  To make breadsticks: While sauce is simmering, preheat oven to 375
  degrees. Combine warm milk, baking powder, green onions, salt and
  pepper; mix well. Add flour and knead until the dough becomes smooth,
  adding more flour if needed, about 3 to 5 minutes. Allow to rest
       30    minutes at room temperature.
  
  Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a bread
  stick and place them on a baking sheet that has been sprayed with
  nonstick vegetable coating. Lightly spray the bread sticks with the
  nonstick coating and bake until golden brown on the bottom, about 10
  to 15 minutes. Turn bread sticks over and bake until other side is
  lightly browned, about 5 more minutes.
  
  To make stir-fry: Trim all visible fat from meat and cut, against the
  grain, into quarter-inch strips. Place oil in a nonstick skillet or
  wok over high heat. Immediately add meat and toss two times. Add
  ginger and garlic and toss two more times. Add carrot, chile and
  onion, toss twice more and remove from heat. Add watercress and toss
  again to mix well.
  
  To serve: Spoon 1/2 cup sauce onto each of four warm plates. Top with
  1 cup of meat mixture and arrange 3 bread sticks in a triangular
  pattern on each plate.
  
  Note: When preparing fresh chilies, wear rubber gloves for protection
  against oils that later can cause burning sensation on skin.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: STIR-FRIED CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Stir-fry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb Chicken breast,
           -boneless
     12    Mushrooms (white)
    1/2 lb Broccoli, fresh
           -(or 1 pk frozen)
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Sherry
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1    Egg white
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           -(peanut oil is best,
           -but sunflower oil
           -is good, too)
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
      6 oz Bamboo shoots, canned
           -(optional)
      6 oz Cashew nuts, broken
           -into large pieces
 
  Cut the boneless chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. Wash and
  slice the mushrooms.  If using fresh broccoli, wash and cut it up
  into bite-sized pieces. If using frozen broccoli, heat it or
  partially thaw it first.
  
  Combine chicken broth, soy sauce, sherry and about 1 T cornstarch.
  Stir well and set aside.
  
  Combine beaten egg white, salt, about 1/2 t oil and about 2 t
  cornstarch. Add the chicken cubes to the mixture and stir until the
  chicken is well-coated. In a wok or deep cast iron pan, heat about 3
  T vegetable oil until hot. Add the chicken pieces in small batches
  and stir continuously until golden brown. After each batch is
  finished, remove and drain. Add oil sparingly as needed.
  
  Stir fry the mushrooms in the wok.  Stir fry the broccoli in the wok.
  Combine the chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, bamboo shoots and cashew
  nuts in the wok. Stir fry to get everything warm again. Add the
  bouillon-cornstarch sauce and stir until thickened.
  
  Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be
  done at the same time as the chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chinese stir-fried chicken with broccoli and nuts. Yield: Serves
  2-3.
  
  *  Bamboo shoots are available in cans at Chinese grocery stores.
  Fresh broccoli is preferable to frozen, and it should be stir-fried
  for only a few minutes to keep it crunchy. Endless variations of this
  basic recipe are possible.  Beef, pork, or other lean meats can be
  substituted for the chicken. Tofu cubes or brown beans can be used to
  make this a vegetarian recipe. Chopped almonds can be used instead of
  cashews. Water chestnuts are a delightful addition. Green or red bell
  peppers can be used instead of broccoli.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  and onion.  Stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the cracked crab pieces and
  stir-fry for 2 minutes.
  
  Add all remaining ingredients except the egg, cilantro and green
  onions. Cover the skillet and continue cooking on medium-high heat

 Categories: Stir-fry, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Sesame oil (or
           -a mixture of sesame
           -oil and clear vegetable
           -oil, to taste)
      6    Szechuan peppers

      2    Garlic cloves,
           -crushed or minced
 
  In a wok heat the oil, then toss in the Szechuan peppers. After about

  until the eggplant is tender (about 10 minutes.) Remove the peppers
  before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple Chinese-style recipe for fresh eggplant -- My favorite for
  eggplants out of the garden is to stir-fry them with garlic and hot
  peppers in sesame oil, according to this simple recipe.
  
  *  I've heard it said that the Armenians judge the value of a woman
  by how many ways she can cook eggplant.

     12 md Asparagus spears
    1/2 ts Fresh ginger root, minced
      1 tb Peanut oil
    1/3 c  Chicken stock
      1 pn Sugar
      1 ts Fish sauce (OR
      2 ts Oyster sauce
           Thin cornstarch paste
 
  This is a basic stir-fried vegetable and meat dish. Adding just a
  touch of fish sauce lends an interesting dimension to the taste.
  
  Preparation: Slice pork butt (or comparable boneless pork) across the
  grain into strips 2" by 1/4" by 1/8" thick. Wash and trim tough white
  skin from asparagus. Cut asparagus into 2 1/2" segments. If asparagus
  is thick (3/4" or more), cut on bias so it will cook quickly and be
  balanced in size with pork strips.
  
  Stir-frying:  Heat peanut oil in wok until it just begins to smoke.
  Add pork strips and stir-fry about 1 minute until no longer pink. Add
  asparagus and stir-fry briskly for another minute. Before asparagus
  turns bright green, add ginger, chicken stock and sugar; keep stir-
  ring. When liquid boils, reduce heat to medium, add fish sauce (not
  oyster sauce, though), cover and simmer for about 1 minute or until
  asparagus is cooked but still firm.  Uncover, turn up heat, and push
  ingredients out of liquid. Dribble in cornstarch paste, stirring
  continuously until liquid thickens. You may need 1 to 2 tsp of paste.
  Recombine ingredients. Serve.

  profound but uncomplicated Korean cooking. Heat a wok, add the oil,
  and chow(stir-fry) the pork for a couple of minutes, adding salt and
  pepper. Add the scallions and toss a bit. Add the Napa Kimchee,
  garlic, and red pepper. Chow (stir-fry) for a couple of minutes until
  all is hot. Remove to a plate and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
  Note: Be careful with the salt because the Napa Kimchee is already
  salty.

      Title: STIR-FRIED SCALLOPS IN A BASKET
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     12    Fresh scallops (or prawns,
           Chicken breast, or fish
           -balls)
     12 sl Giant bamboo shoot
     12 sl Carrot
     12    Fresh snow peas or thinly
           -sliced broccoli
      2 c  Shredded lettuce
      2 md Potatoes
    1/2 ts Salt
      4 c  Oil for deep frying
      3 sl Fresh ginger
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1 pn Salt
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
      2 tb Gin
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
           Cornstarch paste
 
  Contrasting texture, color and appearance are hallmarks of this im-
  pressive banquet dish.
  
  Preparation:  Slice bamboo shoot across grain into 2" triangles. Peel
  & slice carrots on bias.  Remove strings from peas & wash. If substi-
  tuting broccoli, use peeled stems only; slice thinly on bias. Shred
  lettuce; arrange like nest on round 10" serving plate.
  
  Making Potato Basket:  Peel, then coarsely shred potatoes. Or, slice
  potatoes into thin matchsticks. Rinse potatoes in cold water twice;
  soak them 30 minutes in cold salted water; rinse & drain. Slowly heat
  deep-frying oil in wok to medium hot; test potato slice: it should
  brown in 30 seconds.  Dust potatoes with cornstarch so they will
  stick together when fried.  Arrange them in a cross-hatch pattern on
  Chinese wire strainer or other suitable strainer to form deep basket.
  Press them in position with another strainer. If you use bowl for
  pressing, heat it first, because you don't want to cool frying oil.
  Immerse in oil & deep-fry until potatoes begin to brown. Remove from
  oil; take away top strainer only; drain; reserve.
  
  When ready to serve, heat oil to very hot, but not smoking; deep-fry
  potatoes in strainer again until they are brown & crisp. Place basket
  in nest of lettuce.
  
  Blanching:  Dip scallops in hot but not boiling water; remove in 15
  seconds when scallops are warmed: don`t allow them to cook.
  
  Stir-frying:  As you heat wok to medium hot, stir-fry ginger slices &
  garlic to flavor wok; remove when they start to brown; discard. When
  wok is hot, add peanut oil & salt; stir. Add bamboo shoots & carrots;
  stir-fry 1 minute.  Add stock.  When stock boils, add scallops, snow
  peas, sugar, white pepper, gin & soy sauce. Stir 1 minute. Add
  cornstarch paste to thicken. Transfer to potato basket. Serve.

      Title: STIR-FRIED SCALLOPS WITH LEEKS
 Categories: Oriental, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Fresh scallops
      1 lb Leeks
  1 1/2 tb Oil, preferably peanut
      2 tb Scallions; coarsely chopped
      1 tb Garlic; coarsely chopped
      2 ts Fresh ginger; finely chopped
    1/2 ts Salt

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      2 ts Chili bean sauce
      2 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
      2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Sesame oil
 
  If the scallops are very large, cut them in half. They are cooked
  when they are slightly firm to the touch. I find scallops at their
  best when they are just barely cooked through.
  
  DRY THE SCALLOPS WITH PAPER TOWELS and set aside. Trim the leeks and
  discard any yellow parts. Cut the leeks at the point where they begin
  to turn green and discard the green parts. Split the white parts in
  half. Cut the white parts of the leeks at a slight diagonal into
  2-inch segments. Wash them well, several times, in cold water. Heat a
  wok or large frying pan until it is hot, then add the oil, leeks,
  scallions, garlic, ginger and salt and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the
  sauce ingredients and stir-fry the mixture for 3 minutes. Lastly, add
  the scallops and continue to stir-fry for 4 more minutes, or until
  the scallops are just cooked. Serve at once.

      Title: STIR-FRIED SHRIMP WITH GARLIC & GREEN BEANS
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS
      1 lb Large shrimp with shells
      1 c  ;water
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
      3    Cloves garlic; sliced
    1/2 ts ;salt (optional)
      2 tb Dry sherry
      2 ts Sesame oil
    3/4 lb Green beans; trimmed
      2 tb Peanut oil
      2 tb Garlic; minced
      1 tb Fresh ginger; peeled and
           -minced
    1/2 ts Chili-garlic paste*
    1/4 c  Scallions; minced, use both
           -green and white parts
           Juice of 1/2 lime
 
  *Available in Asian markets.
  
  Peel the shrimp and simmer the shells for 5 minutes or so in the water
  while you work on the rest of the recipe. Marinate the shrimp in a
  mixture of 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, the
  sliced garlic, salt, sherry, and 1 teaspoon of the sesame oil while
  you assemble the other ingredients. Drain the shrimp shells,
  reserving 3/4 cup of the stock.
  
  If the green beans are tough, parboil them for 1 minute or so, then
  plunge them into ice water.  If they are large, cut them into pieces.
  When you are ready to cook, preheat a wok or 12-inch skillet over
  medium-high heat for 3 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil
  and raise the heat to medium high. When it begins to smoke, add the
  minced garlic and, immediately thereafter, the shrimp and its
  marinade. Cook the shrimp about 1 minute per side.  Spoon it out of
  the wok or skillet.
  
  Put the remaining peanut oil in the wok, still over high heat, and
  when it smokes, add the ginger, followed immediately by the green
  beans. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they are lightly browned, 3
  to 5 minutes, then add the shrimp stock and let it bubble away for 1
  or 2 minutes. Return the shrimp to the wok and stir; add the
  chili-garlic paste, the scallions, and the remaining sugar and soy
  sauce. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Turn off the heat, drizzle with
  the lime juice and the remaining sesame oil, and serve. Serves 4
  people. Adapted recipe from: Fish, the Complete Guide to Buying and
  Serving, by Mark Bittman.

 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Squid, cleaned
           -Chinese-style [See below.
           -S.C.]
    1/4 c  Raw peanuts, roughly chopped

      1    Or more fresh chile
           -peppers, chopped
      1 ts Cilantro, chopped (optional)
      2 ts Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Chicken stock
      1 ts Cornstarch dissolved in
      1 tb Stock or water
      3 tb To 4 tb vegetable oil
 
  In traditional Chinese cooking, dishes which are part of a banquet-
  style meal usually contain about 1 pound of food. This dish will
  serve 4 if there are 3 other dishes besides soup; 6 if there are 6
  other dishes, etc.
  
  Saute garlic and chile peppers in half the oil over low heat in a wok
  or heavy frying pan until garlic is lightly browned. Add peanuts for
  the last 30 seconds. Stir continuously.
  
  Remove ingredients from the pan, add more oil, if necessary, and the
  squid. Cook for 30 seconds.  Return peanuts, garlic and chiles to
  pan. Immediately add all but 1 Tb of the stock, soy sauce and
  cilantro.
  
  Continue stir-frying for another minute.  Add cornstarch mixture. When
  sauce thickens, remove from heat and serve.
  
  [Score squid diagonally at three quarter inch intervals. Turn and
  repeat at right angles to original cuts. Don't cut all the way
  through the squid body.  Cut each scored squid body into three or
  four pieces.
  
  When cooked, the squid will roll up and the crosshatching will catch
  and hold the sauce.  It's much easier to do than to describe. S.C.]

  reserve the marinade. Trim the mushrooms & quarter the caps. Heat the
  vegetable oil in a wok over high heat.  Fry the tofu until it begins
  to change colour. Turn over & fry the other side, be careful not to
  break it. (If using deep-fried tofu, it won't need as long for

      Title: STIR-FRY INFORMATION
 Categories: Oriental, Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Info
 
  Credit the Chinese with perfecting the technique called "stir-frying."
  Their quick | and easy cooking method pairs lean meats and flavorful
  vegetables. Use one pan and just a scant amount of fat. And don't
  expect all stir-fry recipes to call for Oriental foods or seasonings.
  An Italian stir-fry recipe may call for tomatoes and basil served
  with pasta; a Mexican recipe might include bell peppers, jalaper-lo
  peppers, garlic or onion. Serve this combination over shredded
  lettuce or crisp tortillas. Because stir-frying is a quick-cooking
  process, be sure to have all ingredients ready before you start.
  Select tender meats for stir-fry recipes. Slice meats across the
  grain when possible. This technique involves cutting through or
  against rather
  
  than in the same direction as the meat fibers - doing so makes the
  meat more tender and easier to chew. Both meats and vegetables should
  be cut uniformly so they will cook uniformly.
  
  To be a successful stir-fry cook, remember to:
  
  % Be sure the skillet or wok is large enough to hold food without
  overcrowding; otherwise the food will steam. Most ingredients need to
  be cooked in batches to prevent overcrowding. For example, one pound
  of meat should always be stir-fried in two batches.
  
  % Stir-fry over medium to medium high heat in a traditional wok, or
  other utensil such as a large, heavy skillet.
  
  % During stir-frying, food should be turned continuously. Use a
  scooping motion to ensure even cooking.
  
  % Do not cover the pan while stir-frying or the food will steam.
  
  % Meat should be stir-fried just until cooked through ~ it usually
  takes only a minute or two. Cooked, ready-to-serve deli-style meats
  should only be heated.
  
  % Cook vegetables until crisp-tender and still brightly colored. Group
  vegetables according to the time it takes them to cook. Begin with
  those requiring the longest time, then add remaining vegetables.
  Select vegetables such as asparagus, baby corn, bell peppers,
  broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, Chinese cabbage, garlic,
  green beans, green onions, jalapeno peppers, leeks, mushrooms,
  onions, pea pods, spinach, tomatoes, yellow squash or zucchini.
  
  % Meat and vegetables should be cooked separately, then combined at
  the end of cooking.
  
  % To add flavor (if desired), marinate meat 15-20 minutes while
  preparing other ingredients.
  
  Drain well before cooking.

      Title: STIRRED STOVE-TOP CUSTARD: VANILLA
 Categories: Pudding
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 3/4 c  Milk
      1 c  Heavy cream; or light
      1    Vanilla bean; split lengthws
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
      1 pn Salt
      4    Egg yolks; room temp
      2 tb Unsalted butter; softened
      2 ts Vanilla extract
 
  This is pudding to many people, whether remembered as ultimate
  comfort fare or associated with the nursery table. It is what the
  boxed mixes try to emulat but can not match -- a stirred-from-scratch
  homey tradition. Although using cornstarch as the thickener yields a
  smoother pudding, you may choose to substitute about twice as much
  all-purpose flour. For an even smoother custard, cook the pudding in
  the top of a double boiler set over simmering water.
  
  In a heavy saucepan, combine 2 cups of the milk, the cream, and
  vanilla bean. Place over medium-low heat and warm the mixture until
  bubbles form around the edges of the pan. Remove the vanilla bean and
  scrape the seeds into the milk mixture. Keep warm.
  
  In the top pan of a double boler or in a heavy saucepan, stir
  together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Stir in the remaining 3/4
  cup milk and mix well. Add the egg yolks and whisk to blend. Strain
  the warm milk through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher, then slowly
  whisk it into the sugar mixture. Place over simmering water or low
  heat and cook, stirring or whisking constantly, until thickened,
  about 10 minutes; do not allow to boil. Cover and cook about 8
  minutes longer, whisking or stirring several times. Then, while still
  over the heat, beat with a hand-held mixer set on medium speed or
  with a wire whisk until very smooth, about 2 minutes.
  
  Remove from the heat. Add the butter and vanilla extract and stir
  until the butter melts.
  
  Spoon the custard into 6 individual custard cups or other dessert
  dishes or into a 2-quart casserole dish. Cover with plastic wrap,
  pressing it directly onto the surface of the pudding. Set aside to
  serve warm, or cool to room temperature and refrigerate until
  chilled, at least 2 hours or for as long as 24 hours.

  ALMOND: Omit the vanilla bean and substitute almond extract for the
  vanilla extract. Crumble enough Italian amaretti or other
  almond-flavored macaroons to equal 1 cup fine crumbs. Stir about 2/3
  cup of the crumbs into the pudding along with the almond extract.
  Sprinkle the remaining crumbs over the top of the pudding just before
  serving.
  
  BUTTERSCOTCH: Omit the vanilla bean. Increase the butter to 6 tb and
  substitute 1 3/4 cups firmly packed light brown sugar for the
  granulated sugar. After heating the milk and cream as directed, melt
  the butter in another heavy saucepan over low heat, add the brown
  sugar, and stir until the sugar and butter melt together, about 3
  minutes. Gradually stir or whisk in the warm cream mixture until
  smooth. In the top pan of a double boiler, stir together the
  cornstarch and salt; do not add granulated sugar. Continue as
  directed in the basic recipe, adding the brown sugar /milk mixture in
  place of the milk.
  
  CHOCOLATE: Reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup. Finely chop 6 to 8 ounces
  semisweet or bitter sweet chocolate and stir it into the pudding
  along with the butter until melted.
  
  CITRUS: Omit the vanilla bean. Add 1 tb finely grated or minced lemon,
  lime, orange, or tangerine zest to the milk and cream when heating.
  Strain the milk, if desired, before adding the sugar mixture. Garnish
  the pudding with candied peel of the same fruit.
  
  COCONUT: Substitute canned or freshly made coconut milk for all or
  part of the milk and cream. Sprinkle the top of the pudding with
  lightly toasted sweetened shredded coconut.
  
  COFFEE: Stir about 1 tb instant espresso powder into the warm
  milk-cream mixture.
  
  FRESH FRUIT SWIRL: Prepare the basic custard and chill. Puree about 2
  cups fresh berries or figs, sliced peaches or nectarines, poached
  pears, cooked apples, or stewed dried fruit until smooth. Swirl it
  through the cooled pudding.
  
  HIGH SPIRITED: Omit the vanilla bean and stir in Amaretto, Frangelico,
  Grand Marnier, Kahlua or other liqueur to taste instead of the vanilla
  extract.
  
  MOCHA: Increase the sugar to 1 cup. Add 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa
  powder, preferably Dutch-process type, along with the sugar. Increase
  the butter to 1/4 cup. Stir about 2 ts instant instant espresso
  powder into the warm milk.
  
  PINEAPPLE: Stir 1 cup canned crushed pineapple into the warm custard.

    3/4 c  Chopped blanched almonds
      2 tb Confectioners' sugar
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine the citron, angelica and raisins in a
  small bowl, pour boiling water over to cover, then stir and let
  stand. Melt the butter and let cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast
  over the milk in a large bowl, stir, and let stand a few minutes to
  dissolve. Add the salt, eggs, butter, granulated sugar, mace and
  cardamom, and mix well. Add 2 cups of the flour and beat vigorously
  until smooth. Add 3 more cups flour, 1 cup at a time, beating well
  after each. After adding the last cup, beat until the dough holds
  together in a shaggy ball. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface
  and knead for a minute or 2, sprinkling on more flour if necessary to
  keep it from being too sticky. Let rest for 10 minutes. Drain the
  fruits and raisins in a strainer and press firmly to remove excess
  water.
  
  Sprinkle the fruit and nuts over the dough, and resume kneading until
  the dough is smooth and elastic. Add a little more flour as necessary
  to keep it from being too sticky. Place in a greased bowl, and turn
  the dough about to coat all surfaces. Cover and let rise until double
  in bulk. (This dough is especially rich, and the first rise might
  take as long as 3 hours, depending on the temperature of your
  kitchen.) Punch the dough down and divide in half. Shape and pat each
  piece into an oval about 10 inches long and 4 1/2 inches at the
  widest part. Fold almost in half the long way, bringing the upper
  edge only about 2/3 of the way over, so the bottom edge extends
  beyond the top. Place the loaves on a greased baking sheet, leaving
  several inches between them. Cover lightly and let rise for 45
  minutes. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 40-to-45 minutes,
  until nicely browned. Remove from the oven and dust with the
  confectioners' sugar sprinkled through a sieve, then transfer to
  racks to cool. Makes 2 Loaves

      Title: STORING CANNED FOODS
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  If lids are tightly vacuum sealed on cooled jars, remove screw bands,
  wash the lid and jar to remove food residue; then rinse and dry jars.
  Label and date the jars and store them in a clean, cool, dark, dry
  place. Do not store jars above 95 degrees F or near hot pipes, a
  range, a furnace, in an uninsulated attic, or in direct sunlight.
  Under these conditions, food will lose quality in a few weeks or
  months and may spoil. Dampness may corrode metal lids, break seals,
  and allow recontamination and spoilage.
  
  Accidental freezing of canned foods will not cause spoilage unless
  jars become unsealed and recontaminated. However freezing and thawing
  may soften food. If jars must be stored where they may freeze, wrap
  them in newspapers, place them in heavy cartons, and cover with more
  newspapers and blankets.

      Title: STORING GREEN TOMATOES
 Categories: Harned 1994, Info/tips, Preserves, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
  Colombo writes:  "1.  You can pull the vines, hang them upside down
  in the garage or basement and, when the fruit is ripe, pick it from
  the vine. The temperature should be 55 to 65 degrees.  One problem:
  You'll have to clean up the dirt and tomato-vine debris later.
  
  "2.  Pick the tomatoes and refrigerate the ripe ones. The pinks can be
  ripened in a ripening bowl (a large plastic-covered bowl with holes
  drilled in the top). The cover traps the natural ethylene gas and
  speeds up the ripening process.  The air holes allow air and moisture
  circulation.
  
  "3.  For long-term storage, wrap each tomato in newspaper, then place
  them, no more than two or three layers deep, in open crates or
  baskets. Store in a cool, dark place."
  
  "Another storage method is to set the tomatoes on a rack without
  touching. Cover with a cloth or newspaper. The temperature should be
  between 55 and 60 degrees and the air a little humid, not damp.
  
  "If you need ripe tomatoes, place those that have turned pink in a
  ripening bowl or in an area with a temperature between 65 and 70
  degrees.
  
  "No matter what method of storage you use, check daily for ripened
  fruit and store them in the refrigerator."

  cup water with other ingredients and proceed as directed in step 3
  above. About 260 calories per serving.
  
  *NOTE: Reheat beans over medium heat until mixture is bubbly,
  stirring as needed to prevent sticking.

      Title: STRAITS CHINESE VEGETABLES IN TANGY PEANUT SA
 Categories: Chinese, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Of roasted peanuts
      1    Anchovy fillet, mashed to a
           -paste
      1 ts Of cayenne pepper
      3 tb Of molasses
    1/2 c  Freshly squeezed lime juice
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Of water
 
  The term "Straits Chinese" refers to the Chinese descendants in
  Penang of the original Chinese settlers, many of whom took Malay
  wives. Although the origins and traditions of the food are Chinese,
  the styles of cooking and many of the ingredients are definitely
  Malaysian. This salad, which is filling, flavorful, and very
  satisfying, contains no meat and is, therefore, eminently suited to
  vegetarian diets, being well balanced nutritionally.
  
  SAUCE Crush the peanuts, using either a rolling pin or a large mortar
  and pestle. Place the peanuts, together with the rest of the
  ingredients,in a food processor or blender and process to a smooth
  sauce. Set aside.
  
  VEGETABLES 1 rectangle of bean curd (tofu), pressed in a colander
  until firm and cut into 1 inch cubes 2 medium potatoes, scrubbed but
  not peeled 6 eggs 8 string beans, ends removed, cut on a diagonal
  into 2 inch lengths 1 cup finely shredded whit cabbage 2 3 large
  zucchini, ends removed, cut into 1 inch thick disks 2 cups of tightly
  packed watercress, washed, drained, and lower stems removed 1 cup
  vegetable oil
  
  While the bean curd is pressing, set the potatoes on to boil. In
  another saucepan, hard cook the eggs. When the eggs are
  ready,immediately plunge them into iced water. Empty the egg saucepan
  and refill it with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Put
  the string beans in a small sieve or strainer and immerse them in the
  boiling water for 3 minutes. Remove and set them aside. Refill the
  sieve with the cabbage and blanch it for 2 minutes. Blanch the
  zucchini for 3 minutes. Finally, immerse the watercress for 1
  minutes. Set all the vegetables aside to cool. Shell the eggs and cut
  them in half. Drain the potatoes and set them aside to cool. Pour the
  vegetable oil into a small saucepan and set it over high heat. Remove
  the rectangle of bean curd from its makeshift press, mop it with
  paper towels to remove any residual moisture, and cut it into 1 inch
  cubes. When the oil is up to deep frying temperature (375F) fry the
  bean curd until the exterior of the cubes forms a crisp, golden brown
  skin. Drain and set it aside on paper towels.  Peel the potatoes and
  slice them into disks,1/4 inch thick. On a large platter, arrange the
  ingredients in separate mounds. Pour the sauce over and serve. Makes
  8 servings **Every part of this dish can be made in advance. It can
  be served warm, at room temperature, or cold.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Pt. basket Oregon
           -strawberries, washed and
           -hulled
    1/2    Pt. whipping cream.

   1/2"    thick slices pound cake
  
  Strawberries with Jazzed up Whipped Cream xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xx
  xxxxxxx xxxxx
  
  This idea came to me yesterday when I bought my first basket of Oregon
  strawberries for this season.  Brag all you want about your regional
  products, but there is nowhere on this earth where strawberries are
  sweeter or tastier than in Oregon, especially around the Portland
  metro area.
  
  Whip cream, add Kahlua during final stage. Place sliced pound cake on
  a plate, top with berries and slather on whipped cream.
  
  These recipes are of my own creation and I expect (and deserve)
  appropriate credit when you add them to your cookbook

      Title: STRAWBERRIES WITH ORANGE CHAMPAGNE SABAYON
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Sugar
      3    Egg yolk
  1 1/2 ts Orange peel, grated
    1/2 c  Champagne, dry
    1/4 c  Whipping cream, chilled
      2 tb Whipping cream, chilled
  1 1/2 ts Liqueur, Grand Marnier
  1 1/2 pt Strawberries, fresh, hulled
           -& halved
           Mint leaf, fresh
 
  Servings:   4
  
  **other sparkling wine may be substituted for the Champagne.
  
  My notes:  The egg yolk mixture didn't get thick enough (using large
  eggs), so next time I plan to increase the amount to 4 yolks.
  
  Whisk sugar, egg yolks and orange peel in a medium metal bowl until
  pale yellow and thick, about 3 minutes. Set bowl over saucepan of
  simmering water. Add Champagne to yolk mixture and whisk until
  mixture is doubled in volume and holds shape on spoon, about 5
  minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Set over another bowl filled
  with ice. Cool completely, whisking occasionally.
  
  Using electric mixer, beat cream with Grand Marnier in small bowl
  until almost stiff. Fold cream and Grand Marnier into sabayon. (Can
  be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)
  
  Preheat broiler. Divide strawberries among 4 shallow broilerproof
  bowls or gratin dishes. Spoon sabayon over. Broil until light brown,
  about 2 minutes. Garnish with mint and serve.

  From Lee Bailey. This is an old southern dish that was also common in
  the Maritimes. It is a cooked short cake for strawberries. Really, by
  cooked they mean that the strawberries are cooked in the oven. I
  consider that the preserves in the whipping cream is superfluous. AML

  Preheat oven at 350.  To prepare crust, prepare a 9" pie pan with
  cooking spray and flour.  Place flour in a bowl and drizzle with oil.
  Use a pastry blender to evenly distribute the oil and produce a
  mixture the consistency of coarse cornmeal.  Sprinkle on the water, 1
  tablespoon at a time, and continue mixing until you can gather the
  dough into a ball. Roll the dough into a 11" circle onto a floured
  surface.  Patch any cracks that may form, but otherwise try not to
  handle the dough more than necessary. Transfer the dough to prepared
  pie pan.  Trim the dough, leaving a 1" overhang. Crimp the
  overhanging dough into a decorative edge. Chill the crust 20 minutes.
  To prepare filling, in a mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, 1/2 cup
  sugar, lemon peel, and juice until creamy. Spread mixture into pie
  shell and top with fresh strawberries. In a saucepan, cook frozen
  strawberries, remaining sugar, and cornstarch until bubbly then cook
  two minutes more. Cool completely; pour over strawberries in pie
  shell. Chill.

      Title: STRAWBERRY LIME TART
 Categories: Fruits/nuts, Pies, Desserts
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1    No-Roll Tart Shell
           -(See RECIPE)

MMMMM-------------------------LIME CURD------------------------------
    1/3 c  Strained lime juice
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter
    1/3 c  Sugar
      4    Egg yolks
      2 pt Strawberries
           - rinsed, hulled and sliced
           Confectioners' sugar
           - for finishing
 
  PREPARE AND REFRIGERATE tart shell. FOR THE LIME CURD: COMBINE THE
  LIME JUICE, butter and sugar in a heavy, non-reactive pan. Place over
  low heat and bring to a boil over low heat. Meanwhile, whisk the
  yolks in a bowl until liquid. When the lime mixture boils, whisk half
  of it into the yolks. Return the remaining lime mixture to a boil and
  whisk in the yolk mixture. Whisk constantly until the mixture
  thickens and begins to simmer around the edge of the pan, about 2
  minutes. Pour the lime curd into a non-reactive bowl, press plastic
  wrap against the surface and refrigerate up to 1 week. TO BAKE THE
  TART SHELL: PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F and set a rack in the middle
  level. Pierce the dough with a fork at 1-inch intervals. Cut a
  14-inch disk of parchment or wax paper and line the dough with it,
  making sure it fits flat against the side of the tart shell. Fill
  with dried beans or pie weights and bake about 20 minutes, until the
  dough appears dull and dry when a corner of the paper is lifted.
  Remove the tart shell from the oven, remove the paper containing the
  weights, and return the shell to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes longer,
  until it is lightly colored. Do not overbake or the shell will be dry
  and tough. Cool on a rack. TO ASSEMBLE THE TART: SPREAD THE LIME CURD
  evenly in the tart shell. Arrange the strawberry slices, overlapping,
  in concentric or straight rows on the lime curd. Sprinkle with
  confectioners' sugar immediately before serving.

      Title: STRAWBERRY MERINGUE PUDDING
 Categories: Australian, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This is an Australian recipe circa 1950 (cakes and puddings always
  were Australia's forte) which deserves a revival. At the time, most
  homes always had a supply of cake and biscuits on hand, so cake and
  biscuit crumbs were a by-product which needed a use. Nowadays you
  will probably have to buy a plain cake to obtain the crumbs. The
  recipe is hardly for weight-watchers but, even so, is quite low in
  fat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 190C.  Hull 3 cupfuls of strawberries and slice
  them into an oven dish.  Sift over them half a cup of icing sugar.
  Heat one cup of milk. Separate 2 eggs, beat the yolks and stir into
  the milk off the heat.  Add 1 cup of cake or sweet biscuit crumbs and
  spread the mixture over the strawberries. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile beat the 2 egg whites until stiff then fold in 4
  tablespoons of castor sugar.  Remove the pudding from the oven and
  pile this meringue on top of it in peaks, or swirls.
  
  Bake in a slow (130C) oven for 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 pt Strawberries; sliced
           -(about 2 1/2 cups)
    1/2 c  + 2 Tbs. sugar; divided
      2 tb Orange Liqueur; optional
      1 ea Orange; grated zest of
      1 ea Env. unflavored gelatin
  1 1/4 c  Heavy cream; divided

MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
           Sweetened Whipped Cream
           Additional Strawberries
           Mint Leaves
 
  In food processor combine strawberry slices, 1/2 cup of the sugar,
  liqueur and zest; puree until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl.
  
  In small pot over very low heat, combine orange juice with gelatin.
  Heat, stirring frequently, until all gelatin dissolves, about 2
  minutes. Slowly whisk gelatin mixture into strawberry puree.
  
  With mixer at high speed, beat cream until soft peaks form. Fold 1/4
  of whipped cream into strawberry mixture until well conbined., Gently
  fold in remaining whipped cream. Line 5 cup bowl or mold with plastic
  wrap. Pour in mousse. Chill until firm, about 2 hours.
  
  To unmold, invert onto serving platter. Gently pull mold away from
  plastic wrap. Peel off wrap. Smooth sides of mousse, if necessary,
  with small warm knife or metal spatula. Garnish mousse with whipped
  cream, strawberries and mint, if desired.
  
  Ready to serve in 2 hours 20 minutes.
  
  Tips: To make the cream extra fluffy, chill the cream, mixing bowl and
  beaters for at least 3 hours before beating.
  
  Make sure that the orange juice mixture and strawberry puree is at
  about the same temperature, so it will combine more easily; (no
  lumps). SLOWLY whisk juice mixture into puree.

      Title: STRAWBERRY MOUSSE (DUPREE)
 Categories: Dessert, Fruit
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        1 pt strawberries -- hulled
        1    lemon -- juiced
      1/2 c  water
        2    envelopes gelatin
        2    eggs
        1    egg yolk
        6 TB sugar
      3/4 c  heavy cream -- whipped
  :          *For Decoration
    1 1/2 c  heavy cream -- stiffly
  :          whipped
        1    whole strawberries
  
  Lightly oil a 1-quart ring mold, charlotte mold, or bowl. Puree the
  strawberries in a food processor or blender. They should yield at
  least 1 cup of puree. Set aside. Place the lemon juice, water, and
  gelatin in a very small, heatproof pan, 1-cup metal measure, or
  microwave dish and let stand 5 minutes, or until spongy. Mix the
  eggs, egg yolk, and sugar ina heatproof bowl. Beat them with an
  electric mixer or whisk over nearly boiling water until the mixture
  is thick and light in color and the whisk leaves a light trail.
  Remove from the heat and continue to beat until the mixture is cool.
  
  Dissolve the gelatin over low heat or in the microwave, making sure
  all the granules are dissolved. Stir the liquid gelatin into the egg
  yolk mixture. Add the puree. Place the entire mixture over a pan of
  ice water and stir with a rubber spatula until the mixture is at the
  point of setting. Fold in the softly whipped cream. Pour the mousse
  into the prepared mold. Cover and chill until set, 3 to 4 hours or
  overnight. Lightly oil a serving plate. Tilt the mousse in its mold
  and pull it gently away from the sides to catch an air bubble. Place
  the oiled plate over the mold, then invert. Give a quick shake and
  remove the mold. Put the stiffly whipped cream into a pastry bag or
  plastic bag fitted with a star tip and decorate with rosettes of
  whipped cream. Place a whole berry on top of each. May be made up to
  1 day in advance. Make 4 or 6.

    1/2 c  Plain yogurt
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      1 x  -----------syrup------------
      3 tb Water
      3 tb Granulated sugar
      2 tb Strawberry or kirsch liqueur
      1 x  -cream frosting and garnish-
      1 ea ------------------------
      2 c  Stawberries
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Granulated sugar
 
  CAKE:  Butter and flour the bottom and sides of a 9 inch spring form
  pan; set aside.  In a large bowl beat whites and cream of tartar to
  soft peaks. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup of the sugar, continuing to
  beat to stiff peaks. In a separate bowl beat the yolks with remaining
  sugar until light yellow and thickened. Scrape yolks over whites, add
  lemon rind and vanilla and fold together.  Sift flour and salt over
  batter, folding in gently but thoroughly.  Transfer to prepared pan.
  Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until the top springs back
  when lightly touched. Let cool in pan on wire rack.  If making ahead,
  remove from pan and wrap well for storage at cool room temperature
  for one to two days or in the freezer for up to 2 months. MOUSSE:  In
  a very small saucepan sprinkle gelatin over water; set aside. Rinse,
  hull and puree berries. In a small saucepan combine puree, sugar and
  lemon juice and heat gently just long enough to dissolve sugar.
  Remove from heat.  Warm softened gelatin over low heat until clear
  and syrupy. Stir into strawberry mixture.  Transfer to a large bowl
  and chill to consistency of raw egg white.  Whisk in the yogurt. Whip
  cream until form; fold into mousse and return to fridge. SYRUP: In a
  small saucepan bring water and sugar to a boil.  Remove from heat,
  cool and stir in liqueur. ASSEMBLY: Using a long serrated knife, but
  cake into 2 thin layers. Place top half, but side up, in the botton
  of a clean 9 inch spring for pan. Drizzle half the syrup ivenly over
  the cut side of each of the 2 halves. Spoon strawberry mousse over
  cake in pan; don't worry if mousse extends over the sides.  Set
  remaining layer, cut side over mousse, pressing gently. Cover and
  chill thoroughly, overnight if possible. Release sides of pan, and
  using a wide lifter, transfer cake to service plate, doily-lined if
  you've thought that for ahead. CREAM FROSING AND GARNISH: Rinse and
  hull berries. Slice thinly. Whip cream until it's stiff and firm.
  Sweeten with sugar and spread ivenly over top and sides of cake.
  Arrange berry slices in circle around the top and bottom edges of the
  cake. Refrigerate until serving time, which should be within the
  following hour or two.

      Title: STRAWBERRY MUFFINS
 Categories: Digest, July, Ovo
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Oatbran
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  Apple fiber
        x  Skim milk, if needed
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 tb Corn syrup (originally
           Canola oil)
      2 c  Strawberries, fresh or
           Frozen, preferably
           Unsweetened (I used fresh)
      3    Egg whites
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line 12 muffin cups with paper cups or
  spray them with Pam. In a large mixing bowl or in the food processor,
  combine oat bran, apple fiber, and baking soda. (I just stirred with
  a spoon) Stir until thoroughly mixed. Place in a blender or food
  processor 1 cup of the strawberries with the sugar and puree until
  smooth. Measure the strawberry puree; if it does not measure 1 cup,
  add enough skim milk to bring it to that level. Dice remaining
  strawberries. In a small mixing bowl combine the strawberry puree and
  the corn syrup, and stir this into the dry ingredients to combine
  thoroughly.  Stir in the chopped stawberries. Beat egg whites until
  stiff and fold them into the batter. Spoon the batter into the
  prepared muffin cups and bake for 20 minutes.
  
  NOTES:  The batter looked very dry to me and so did the muffins when
  they came out of the oven, they looked funny too. But I just ate one
  and they are delicious and more moist than the muffins I usually make!

  Dehydrate in a dehydrator or in oven.*
  
  To dry in an oven just set temp at lowest possible setting --about 140
  degress would be good.  Dry until fruit feels leather like ;yet
  pliable. This would probably best be done on parchment paper, Remove
  the leather while it is still warm and roll it up.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Baby greens or mesclun
     12 md Fresh strawberries
      8 x  Fresh chives
      4 oz Parmesan cheese
           (whole block, not grated)

      6 oz Canola oil
           Juice of 1 lemon
      1 ts Whole grain mustard
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  This very elegant salad comes to us from chef Willie White of New
  Brunswick's fabulous Algonquin Hotel.  Chef White likes to garnish
  this impressive salad with edible flowers such as nasturtiums or
  chive blossoms. He says that a Sauvignon Blanc is a nice wine for
  accompanying this salad.
  
  For Salad: Cut cheese into 12 rounds, each 2 1/2 inches wide. Give
  each cheese round a generous twist of freshly ground pepper and bake
  at 400F for 5-6 minutes or until golden brown. Let cheese crisps
  cool. Place 1/2 tsp. cream cheese on each parmesan crisp.  Layer each
  one with strawberries and greens.  Top off with more greens set in
  cream cheese. Garnish with 2 fresh chives and edible flowers, of
  desires. Place wedges of strawberries around the plate an
  
  For Dressing: Blend all ingredients except the oil. Add oil slowly
  while mixing ( a food processor works well for the entire process).
  The dressing is best when made a day ahead of time. Mix well before
  serving.

  hour.
  
  Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar, flour,
  baking powder and salt. Use a fork or two knives to cut in butter
  until mixture resembles coarse meal.
  
  Whisk together egg and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons cream. Slowly add
  this mixture to dry ingredients; mix with a fork until dough just
  comes together. Do not overmix.
  
  Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface; pat into a 6-inch
  square. Cut four 21/2-inch rounds; place on a parchment-lined baking
  sheet. Whisk together egg yolk and remaining tablespoon cream; brush
  over tops of biscuits. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
  Cool slightly on wire racks, about
       15    minutes.
  
  Slice shortcakes open while warm. Divide strawberries and their juice
  among bottom halves of shortcakes; top with large dollops of Vanilla
  Whipped Cream and upper halves of shortcakes. Serves 4.

      2 pt Strawberries
    1/4 c  Water
    3/4 c  Sugar
      6 lg Egg whites
      1 pn Salt
           Vegetable cooking spray

  FOR THE SOUFFLE: Rinse, hull and puree the berries. Puree the berries

  remaining puree for the sauce.) Combine water and sugar in a 2-quart
  saucepan and bring to a boil over low heat. Cook until the syrup

  dissolve any sugar which may have hardened when the puree was added.
  Bring to a boil and cool. Thirty minutes before serving the souffle,
  preheat the oven to 400F and set a rack in the lower part of the
  oven. Spray a 2 1/2-quart oval gratin dish or rectangular glass
  baking dish with vegetable cooking spray and sprinkle the inside of
  the dish with sugar. Whip the egg whites with the salt until they
  hold a soft peak. Fold in the cooled strawberry puree. Pour the
  souffle batter into the dish and smooth the top of the batter with a
  metal spatula. Bake about 15 minutes, until well risen and lightly
  colored. Serve immediately. FOR THE STRAWBERRY-ORANGE SAUCE: While
  the souffle is baking, combine the sauce ingredients in the blender
  (adding any leftover puree) and puree. Place in saucepan and bring to
  a boil and reduce for a minute or 2. Serve with the souffle. Vary
  this souffle with other fruit or berries--use 2 cups of pureed,
  strained fruit as a substitute for the strawberries.

    1/2 c  Raspberry vinegar

  Strawberries need not be confined to dessert, says Denis Pelletier,
  chef at Restaurant Le Mouilin de St. Laurent on Ile d'Orleans. The
  island is one of the province's lushest strawberry-growing areas. The
  chef suggests serving this colourful salad with a semi-soft cheese as
  St. Nectaire. Make a salad dressing by combining vinegar, oil and
  water. Add chopped shallots and pepper to taste. Arrange sliced
  strawberries in a spiral formation on the spinach and drizzle with
  the dressing. SERVES:6

      Title: STRAWBERRY SPIRAL PIE
 Categories: Pies, Crusts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Strawberries Hulled,Washed
           And Drained
           (About 4 1/2 Cups)
    2/3 c  Strawberry Jam
      1 tb Unsalted Butter
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Quick Cooking Tapioca
    1/2 ts Ground Ginger
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 c  Sugar
           Biscuit Dough (Check Pies
           Pastries)
 
  Preheat the oven to 450, and line the oven floor with foil to catch
  any drips. Spread the strawberries on paper towels to dry. In a small
  bowl, stir the jam to loosen it. In a saucepan, melt the butter and
  keep warm. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch,
  tapioca,ginger,cinnamon,nutmeg and sugar.  Halve any very large
  berries. Gently toss the berries with the dry ingredients. On a
  lightly floured surface, roll out the biscuit dough into a 10x18
  rectangle. Square off the corners. Brush the dough lightly with about
  half of the melted butter. Using an icing spatula, spread the jam
  over the rectangle, leaving a 1/2 inch border on one long side.
  Starting at the opposite long side, roll up the dough jelly-roll
  fashion and pinch the seam closed. Roll the log so that it is an even
  diameter, exactly 18 inches long; turn the log seam side down. Using
  a large sharp knife, quarter te log, then cut each quarter into 3
  equal pieces so that there will be 12 spiraled biscuits in all. Using
  a rubber spatula, fold the strawberry filling once to remix. Spoon
  the filling into a 9 inch glass pie plate and smooth the top.
  Arrange the pie and the remaining 4 biscuits in the center.  Don't
  push the biscuits down into the strawberries. Bake the pie for 20
  minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is
  bubbling.  Lower the oven temp to 350 loosely cover the pie with foil
  and bake for 15 minutes longer. Transfer to a rack to cool for 30
  minutes before serving.
