  *DIRECTIONS  +++*
  
  1.  Heat the cream almost to a simmer in a heavy medium-size saucepan.
  Remove the cream from the bowl, and divide it among three mixing
  bowls in these amounts: 1-1/4 c, 1 c., 3/4 c.
  
  2.  Stir the bittersweet chocolate into the 1-3/4 c. cream, whisking
  until smooth.  Stir the milk chocolate into the 1 c. cream, whisking
  until smooth.  Stir the white chocolate into the 3/4 c. cream, and
  add the seeds from the vanilla bean; stir until smooth.  Cover the
  three bowls loosely and refrigerate until the mixtures are thick but
  still pourable, 3 hours.
  
  3.  Line a 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 in. loaf pan with aluminum foil. Leave some
  foil above the edge of the pain.
  
  4.  Transfer the white chocolate mixture to a mixer bowl, and beat
  until it forms soft peaks--be careful not to overbeat it. Beat the
  last two or three strokes by hand; the mixture should be thick and
  firm. Scrape it into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and chill it
  in the freezer for 5 minutes.
  
  5.  Repeat the beating process with the milk chocolate mixture and
  spread it over the white chocolate mixture in the loaf pan. Smooth
  the top, and freeze for 5 minutes.
  
  6.  Repeat again with the bittersweet chocolate. Spread it over the
  milk chocolate mixture, smooth the top, and cover with plastic wrap.
  Refrigerate until firm, 3 hours.
  
  7.  Lift up the foil to unmold the terrine.  Remove the foil and cut
  the terrine into 1/2-in. thick slices. Spoon a pool of chocolate
  sauce onto each plate, and arrange a slice on top. Let stand 5
  minutes before serving.

      Title: TRIPLE CHOCOLOATE BISCOTTI
 Categories: Cookies, Desserts
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
  1 3/4 c  Hazelnuts -- (9 oz)
  2 2/3 c  Flour, unbleached -- (10.5
           Oz)
      1 c  Cocoa, dutch-process -- (3.5
           Oz)
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Dark roasted coffee (or
           Instant espesso) -- finely
           Ground
    2/3 c  Chocolate chips -- (4 oz)
      5 lg Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
     12 oz White chocolate
 
  I've used walnuts every time I've made these.
  
  Heat the oven to 325.  Toast the hazelnuts on baking sheet for 10 to
  15 minutes, until they emit a nutty aroma but haven't turned dark
  brown inside.   If they still have skins, cover the nuts with a
  dishtowel or paper towels for a few minutes after you take them out
  of the oven and then rub the nuts with thetowel to remove the skins.
  Set aside to cool.
  
  Put the flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, sugar, and coffee into the
  bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Combine these
  ingredients on a medium-low speed and then toss in the nuts and
  chocolate chips. In a separate bowl, lightly whisk together the eggs
  and vanilla extact. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add
  the egg mixture to the mixing bowl until the dough comes together.
  Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix in any remaining dry
  ingredients from the bottom by hand.
  
  Divide the dough into four equal parts.  With floured hands, roll
  each part into a log about 10 inches long and 2 inches in diameter.
  Place the logs 4 inches apart on greased or parchment lined baking
  sheets.
  
  Bake the logs at 325 for 30 to 35 minutes, until the sides are firm,
  the tops are cracked and the dough inside no longer looks wet. Remove
  the baking sheets from the oven and reduce the temparature to 300.
  Let the logs cool on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes before
  slicing the logs on a slight diagonal into 3/4 inch slices. Place the
  biscotti flat on the baking sheet and dry them in the oven for about
  25 minutes, until the biscotti offer resistance when pressed.
  Transfer the biscotti to a rack to cool.
  
  While the biscotti are cooling, chop the white chocolate and melt ina
  microwave on low power or in a double boiler. With a knife, spread
  white chocolate on one cut side of each cooked biscotti. Put the
  biscotti, white-chocolate side down, on a parchment-lined baking
  sheet. Allow the chocolate to harden. Peel the biscotti from the
  parchment and store in an airtight container.

      5 lg Eggs
  2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Plus 1 tablespoon
           -fresh lemon juice

MMMMM-----------------------LEMON FROSTING----------------------------
      1 md Lemon Peel, removed
           -as thinly as possible
           -with a veg peeler
    1/3 c  Sugar
     16 oz Regular cream cheese,
           -softened (not fat-free)
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 c  Flaked coconut, toasted
           -(see Tips,below)
           Garnish: berries
 
  This cake is meant to be moist and a bit dense, more like POUND CAKE
  than most layer cakes. You may omit the Lemon Filling and use some of
  the frosting between the layers instead. There's more than enough.
  
  Lemon Filling: Whisk sugar, eggs and egg yolks in a small heavy
  saucepan until well blended. Stir in lemon peel and juice and butter.
  Cook, stirring often, over low to medium-low heat about 10 minutes.
  As the mixture thickens, stir constantly, 8 to 10 minutes longer
  until it thickly coats the back of a metal spoon (don't boil or
  mixture may curdle). Pour through a strainer set over a bowl; cover
  surface of filling and refrigerate at least 4 hours. Filling will
  thicken more as it cools. Adjust oven racks to divide oven in thirds.
  Heat oven to 350 F. Lightly grease three 8-inch layer-cake pans. Line
  bottoms with waxed paper and grease paper. Dust pans with flour;
  shake out any excess. Cake: In a food processor or blender, process
  lemon peel and sugar several minutes until peel is finely ground.
  Transfer to a large bowl, add butter, baking powder, salt and vanilla
  and beat with electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Add eggs, one at
  a time, beating well after each addition. With mixer on low speed,
  add flour mixture alternately with lemon juice, mixing well after
  each addition. Pour into prepared pans. Stagger pans on oven racks
  and bake, switching position of pans once to ensure even layers,
  about 40 minutes, until tops of cakes spring back when gently pressed
  and a toothpick inserted near centers comes out clean. Cool in pans
  on wire rack 20 minutes. Invert cakes on rack, remove waxed paper and
  let cakes cool completely. Meanwhile make frosting: In a food
  processor or blender, process lemon peel and sugar several minutes
  until peel is finely ground. Beat cream cheese, lemon juice and sugar
  mixture in a medium bowl with electric mixer until smooth (all this
  may be done in the food processor). Cover with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate about 1 hour or until firm but spreadable. To assemble:
  Place 1 cake layer on a serving plate. Spread half the Lemon Filling
  (3/4 cup) on top. Top with another cake layer and remaining filling.
  Top with remaining cake layer. Coat sides and top of cake with the
  frosting. Gently press toasted coconut into frosting on sides of
  cake. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Just before serving, garnish
  with berries.
  
  To toast coconut: Spread flaked coconut on cookie sheet or glass pie
  plate. Bake in a 350 F oven 6 to 8 minutes or microwave on high,
  stirring once or twice, until lightly browned. Cool before using.

 Categories: Meatless
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Canola oil
      1 c  Diced onion
      1 tb Minced garlic
      1    Jalapeno -- seeded and
           Minced
      1    Red bell pepper -- seeded
           And chopped
      1 lb Sliced mushrooms --
           Assortment
      2 tb Hoisin sauce
      1 c  Cooked basmati rice
    1/4 c  Pecans, dry-roasted --
           Pulverized
  1 1/2 c  Dry bread crumbs
           Salt
 
  Dry-pan roast the pecans.  When cooled, process to a coarse powder.
  
  Heat oil in a large skillet. Saute onion and garlic until onions turn
  brown at the edges and garlic is golden. Add jalapeno, bell pepper
  and mushrooms. Reduce heat, cover and cook until vegetables are
  tender, 10 to15 minutes. Add hoisin sauce and mix well.
  
  With a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to a large bowl. Increase
  heat and reduce the sauce remaining in the skillet until very thick,
  stirring often for 5 to 10 minutes. Pour sauce over the vegetable
  mixture. Place mixture and rice in the bowl of a food processor.
  Pulse several times until the ingredients are thoroughly blended.
  Transfer to a large bowl and mix in ground pecans and 1-1/4 cup
  crumbs, with your hands. Season with salt.
  
  Form into 3-inch patties about 1/2-inch thick, mixing in extra crumbs
  if patties don't hold their shape. They will be delicate, so handle
  gentle.
  
  Broil or grill patties until brown on both sides and heated through.
  Served on toasted buns with lettuce, onion and ketchup. Makes 12.
  
  Pat H's notes.  Try chipotle mayo and sliced tomato.
    Shape with burger press and waxed paper; freeze; fry (frozen patty)
  with a little vegetable spray.

  Triticale is a nutritious grain that is a hybrid of wheat and rye.
  You can find it in most health food stores. It adds to the taste but
  not much to the rising of bread. In combination with wheat flour, it
  makes good bread for sandwiches or toast, with a pleasant but
  unobtrusive flavor.
  
  Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine
  manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
  manufacturer's directions.

      Title: TRITICALE CRISPS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 75 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Cracked wheat, soaked in
           Warm water for 5 to 10
           Minutes and drained well
  1 1/2 c  Triticale flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      3 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Water
 
  "This simple cracker provides a good way to taste the complex flavor
  of triticale. The cracked wheat adds texture and crunch. Add a few of
  these crackers and some sliced Swiss cheese to your family's lunch
  pails. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.
  
  Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl or in the food processor.
  Blend in the oil until mixture resembles coarse meal.
  
  Add the cracked wheat and mix well. Slowly stir in enough of the
  water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch. With a sharp knife or
  a cookie cutter, cut the dough into desired 2-inch shapes.
  
  Place on an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 20 to
  25 minutes, turning over after 10 minutes. Make sure these crackers
  get medium brown to bring out their flavor. Cool on a rack. Yield:
  60-75.
  
  VARIATION: For a more delicate cracker, roll the dough thinner, to
  1/16 inch, and reduce the baking time slightly.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     70    Calories per 1/2 cup; a
           -large egg, 80 calories; the
           -banana, 100
 
  Put very ripe unpeeled bananas in a plastic bag in the freezer.
  Remove as needed to make this easy blender drink or dessert:
  
  Remove 1 banana from the freezer and allow it to defrost just enough
  to remove the peel.  Cut the partly-thawed, peeled banana into chunks
  and put it in the blender or food processor with a few drops of
  vanilla extract and coconut flavoring.  Add skim milk or low-fat
  yogurt and blend smooth. A small amount of milk or yogurt will create
  a "frozen custard." Add more milk or yogurt for a milkshake.  Add a
  whole egg for a high-protein instant breakfast or lunch. (Top with a
  dash of cinnamon or nutmeg, if desired.)
  
  Skim milk has approximately 45 calories per 1/2 cup; plain low-fat

 Categories: Low-cal, Chicken, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Chicken; quartered parts
      8 oz Pineapple; crushed  packed
    1/2 c  Estee granulated fructose
      2 tb Lemon juice
      1 ts Dry mustard powder
 
       The recipe, as POSTED (a rose by any other name....) was
  published by Hidden Valley about 10 years ago, and I'm not sure that
  the low fat version was available at the time. Since it is being
  used, in this case, primarily as a seasoning, I see no reason why the
  low fat would not work. As to the eggs, their main purpose is to hold
  the seasoning to the chicken. Again, I think that the whites alone
  would do the job. I also came across another chicken recipe that may
  be of interest to you. Mix pineapple with its juice, fructose, lemon
  juice and mustard in small bowl. Place chicken on rack in shallow
  baking pan. Spread pineapple mixture over each piece of chicken
  (approx 2 tablespoons each). Bake for 20 minutes, then remove from
  oven to baste again. Bake 20 minutes and baste again. Return to oven
  for final 20 minutes of baking. Pour pineapple sauce and drippings
  from baking pan into bowl and chill. Skim fat, then return to sauce
  pan to reheat. Serve sauce over chicken.

      Title: TROUT SAUTEED IN BUTTER
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Salt and pepper
      4    Fresh trout, dressed
           A few Tbsp. flour
      6 tb Unsalted butter
           Parsley sprigs
           Lemon wedges
 
  As every angler knows, skillet-size brook, brown, and rainbow trout
  are never more tasty than when prepared this way. Can there be any
  tastier dish than the one that comes from this happy marriage of
  fresh trout and butter? But for best results, a few words of warning:
  a basic rule of fish cookery is that fish, unless deep fried, should
  be cooked slowly. Yet, at the same time, one wants the flesh moist
  but with the outside golden brown. Furthermore one wants to be able
  to serve trout whole, not in broken chunks, the result of sticking.
  One other word: since trout are delicately flavored, I do not "flour"
  trout with cornmeal but with flour. However, either way, the trout
  will be delicious. Salt, pepper and coat the trout by rolling them in
  the flour.
     Melt the butter in a big iron skillet.
     When the butter is hot (over medium heat) but has not yet shown
  color, lay in the trout and turn the fire low. A steady, low heat
  will do two things: cook the trout slowly and at the same time brown
  the trout.
     You must police the process continuously, and it will take 15-20
  minutes, depending on the size of the trout.
     Just as soon as the flour coating has set on the down side, loosen
  each trout from the skillet, shaking the skillet gently to keep the
  slow browning trout free.
     After 10 minutes of slow browning, turn each trout carefully and
  repeat the above process.
     When you serve the trout, pour a bit of the butter over each and
  garnish with a sprig of parsley and a wedge of lemon. SAUTEED QUICK

     If you wish, add a couple of pats of butter to the skillet after
  the trout has been served, melt them, squeeze in a tablespoon of
  lemon juice, turn up the heat, and stir. Then pour this lemon-butter
  sauce over each trout.

      4    Trout fillets
           A little flour

  Toast the nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking the pan
  often, for about 5 minutes.  Set aside. Wipe the skillet with paper
  towels.
  
  Dust the fish fillets with flour and shake off the excess. Heat just
  enough oil to film generously the bottom of the skillet. Add the
  fish, season with salt and pepper, and cook over medium heat until
  pale gold on both sides, turning once.  Remove the fish to a warm
  dish. Pour the vinegar into the pan, stirring to melt any browned
  bits, add the toasted nuts and spoon evenly over the fish.

  If you'd like to serve the trout as a fish course in aspic, let the
  trout cool in the liquor, then remove and drain the trout.
     Strain the liquor the trout were simmered in, add to it the tomato
  sauce, and over fire stir in the gelatin. Stir over low heat just
  until the gelatin melts. Set gelatin liquid in refrigerator until it
  cools but is not as yet "set."
     Arrange trout in a flat dish, pour over them the aspic, and allow
  to set.
     Arrange parsley and then lemon slices around the trout and serve.

      1 c  Seeded, sliced in 1/4"
      4    Eggs, lightly beaten
           Strips, red or green pepper
      2 ts Soy sauce
      4    Trout, 8-10 oz. boned with
           Skin, head and tail
      3    Scallions, cut in 1/2"
           Including greens
      8    Strips of bacon
      1 c  Bean sprouts
      2    Ribs celery, sliced
 
  Mix the vegetables together.  In a large skillet or wok heat oil,
  then toss in the vegetables and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the eggs
  and soy sauce and continue to toss and cook for another minute until
  eggs begin to coagulate.
    Stuff each of the 4 trout with one-fourth of the vegetable
  mixture--the filling will expand the opening by about an inch. Wrap 2
  slices of bacon around each trout, tucking the ends under the trout.
    Bake in a large baking dish so trout are not touching in preheated
  500 degree oven about 15 minutes, until skin is crisp and the fish is
  opaque to the bone.  Test after 12 minutes. Vegetables will remain
  crisp.

  ingredients; bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. You
  should have about 3 cups.  Court Bouillon can be made several days
  ahead, or it can be frozen.
  
  COOKING AND SERVING: Bring Court Bouillon to a simmer. Put the
  fillets, skin side down, into the simmering liquid, lower heat, and
  poach gently until fish is just cooked through, about 5 minutes.
  Remove fish from the liquid, peel off the skin, and cover to keep
  warm. Strain the Court Bouillon and put 1/4 cup into a small
  saucepan. Reserve remaining bouillon for another use. Add wine and
  vinegar to the saucepan and bring to a boil; boil about 3 minutes
  until liquid is reduced to 2 tbs. Over the lowest possible heat,
  whisk in the butter a bit at a time. The butter should soften to make
  a creamy sauce but should not melt completely. Stir in the chives,
  parsley, tarragon, and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and
  pepper. Serve the fish topped with the sauce.
  
  Yield: 4 servings.
  
  NOTE:  The Herb Butter Sauce here is a variation of the traditional
  French beurre blanc.  The sauce is rich and powerful, yet also subtle
  enough so that it won't overpower the delicate taste of the poached
  fish. The trick to making this sauce is to emulsify the butter
  without melting it, so that the sauce is creamy. The acid in the wine
  and vinegar aid in the emulsification.  Whisk in the butter, a tbs at
  a time, over the lowest possible heat, moving on and off the heat as
  necessary.

      Title: TRUCHAS A LA NAVARRA (TROUT WITH RED WINE AND
 Categories: Fish, Spanish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Onions; finely chopped
      1 tb Mint, fresh; finely cut
    1/2 ts Rosemary, dried
    1/2 ts Thyme, dried
      1 sm Bay leaf; crumbled
     15    Whole black peppercorns
           -use up to 20
      1 ts Salt
      4    Trout;*
      3    Egg yolks; lightly beaten
 
  * 8 to 12 ounces each, cleaned but with heads and tails left on
  
  In a flameproof glass, enamel or stainless-steel baking dish large
  enough to hold the fish in one layer, combine the red wine, olive
  oil, water, onions, mint, rosemary, thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns and
  salt, and stir thoroughly. Wash trout under cold running water and
  dry them completely with paper towels. Then place them in the
  marinade, turning them about to coat them thoroughly. Marinate at
  room temperature for about 30 minutes, turning the trout over after
       15    minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On top of the stove bring the
  marinade to a simmer, then lay a sheet of wax paper or foil lightly
  over the baking dish. Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes,
  or until the fish is firm to the touch. Be careful not to overcook.
  
  With a slotted spatula, transfer the fish to a heated serving platter
  and cover loosely with foil to keep them warm. Strain the cooking
  liquid through a fine sieve into a small saucepan, pressing down hard
  on the onions and herbs with the back of a spoon before discarding
  them. Whisk about 1/4 cup of the liquid into the beaten egg yolks,
  then whisk the mixture into the remaining liquid in the pan. Heat
  slowly, whisking constantly, until the sauce thickens lightly. (Do
  not let it come anywhere near a boil or it will curdle.) Taste for
  seasoning.
  
  Pour the sauce over the trout or serve the sauce separately.
  Traditionally the trout are accompanied by hot, freshly boiled
  potatoes.

    3/4 c  Butter, unsalted; cold
      6 tb Shortening; chilled
      3 c  Flour, bread
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  ;Water, ice (about)

MMMMM------------------------MEAT FILLING-----------------------------
      3    Lamb kidneys
    1/2 lb Steak, fat free
      2 md Potato
      1 md Onion
      1 lg Carrot
      1    Garlic clove
      2 tb Parsley; chopped (opt)
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 ts Pepper, black
      1 lg Egg; beaten
 
  Cut fat into the flour with a pastry blender or 2 knives or an
  electric mixer until the mixture is blended and forms lumps the size
  of peas. Rub mixture between your fingers until you have a fine
  grained texture. Add just enough ice water to make it stick together
  and quickly knead it into a smooth and shiny ball. Speed is
  important. Cover and refrigerate for 60 minutes before rolling out.
  Halve the kidneys and remove film and fatty core.  Dice the kidneys
  and steak very fine. Peel and chop the vegetables equally as fine.
  Mix well in a bowl with parsley and spices. Preheat the oven to 375
  degrees F.  Roll out the unsweetened pastry to a thickness of 1/8
  inch and cut into 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter. Put a spoonful
  of the meat mixture in the center of the rounds. Paint the edges
  lightly with water.  Cover with the remaining rounds, pinching the
  edges together very firmly.  Prick well with a fork.  Place on a

 Categories: Breads, Garlic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 x  Garlic Puree(2 Roasted Head)
    1/4 lb Unsalted Butter, Softened
      2 tb (2 pk) Dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm Water (115-120 degrees)
  2 1/2 c  Warm Water
      2 tb Kosher Salt
  3 1/4 c  Whole Wheat Flour
  3 1/4 c  Unbleached All Purpose Flour
      1 x  Cornmeal
 
  Cream together the garlic puree and butter.  (This may be done days in
  advance and refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature before using).
  Combine the yeast with 1/2 cup warm water in large bowl. Stir with a
  fork or small whisk.  Add an additional 2 1/2 cups water.  Add salt.
  Stir in the flour, 1 c at a time, beginning with the whole wheat. Use
  a whisk until the dough becomes stiff, then switch to a wooden spoon.
  Turn the dough onto a well floured work surface.  Knead rhythmically
  for 10 to 15 minutes, until the dough is smooth, springy, nonsticky,
  and elastic. Add more flour as you knead if necessary.  The dough is
  ready if you can poke to fingers into it and the resulting
  indentations spring back. Cover the dough with a cloth and let rest
  while you wash, dry and generously butter the bowl. Knead the dough a
  few more turns, then form it into a ball and place it in the bowl.
  Turn it to coat with butter.  Cover the bowl and put it in a warm,
  draft-free place until the dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2
  hours. It has risen sufficiently when you can gently poke a finger
  into the dough and the hole reamins.  (Don't poke too
  enthusiastically or the dough will collapse.)  When doubled, flour
  your fist and punch the dough down. Knead it a few times and then let
  it rest. Sprinkle 1 large or 2 small baking sheets with a liberal
  amount of cornmeal. Divide the dough into 3 equal parts. While you
  work with 1 piece, keep the other 2 covered. Flour your work surface.
  With a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a rectangle
  approximately 14-inches long X 7-inches wide. Spread it with softened
  garlic butter.  Roll the long edge toward the opposite long edge, as
  if you were rolling up a rug. Pinch ends closed. Place loves on the
  baking sheets. With a sharp knife or razor blade, slash the loves
  lightly at 2-inch intervals.  Cover with a cloth and place in a warm
  draft-free place to rise until doubled, about 1/2 hour. Meanwhile
  preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes with a pan
  of boiling water on the oven floor.  Spray loaves with water several
  times during the baking process.  (This helps the bread form a thick
  crusty shell.) To test for doneness, rap the loaf with your knuckles.
  The loaf should sound hollow. Cool on wire racks, but the loaves are
  delicious eaten warm right out of the oven.

 Categories: Chocolate, Candies, Christmas, Holiday
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 oz Chocolate
  1 1/2 oz Butter
      2 oz Powdered sugar
      2 tb Fresh cream
 
  Preparation: Put cream, butter and grated chocolate into a pan. The
  chocolate need not be grated fine. The cream can be replaced by
  skimming the top off raw milk poured into a wide basin and allowed to
  settle. Melt butter, chocolate, and cream in a double boiler,
  stirring to mix well. When melted, remove the double boiler from the
  fire, leaving the hot water in the bottom pan to keep it warm. Sift
  the powdered sugar in slowly, so that it will not form lumps,
  stirring constantly. Let stand 24 hr. in a cool place. (In winter, 12
  hr. in a cold room will do.) At the end of this time, cut a piece of
  this chocolate about the size of a small nut, using a knife or spoon.
  Roll it into a ball in the palm of the hand until the outside of the
  bonbon begins to melt a little. Then roll it in grated or granulated
  chocolate, which will stick to it perfectly. Let stand 2 hr. before
  serving, but in a place that is not too cold, because these truffles
  are better when they are a little soft. Instead of rolling them into
  balls, you can also shape them to look more like truffles.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Good chocolate
           About 1/2 glass water
      3    Egg yolks
      3 oz Butter
  1 1/2 oz Praline paste
 
  Slowly melt the chocolate in the water, bring to a gentle boil,
  remove from the fire, and add the yolks, beating with a spatula, then
  replace on a low fire to poach the eggs in the chocolate. Do not stop
  beating. Remove from the fire and add the butter and the praline
  paste. Let cool, beating from time to time (this cooling takes a
  rather long time). When the mixture begins to solidify, take some
  with a spoon, place it in some grated chocolate (prepared in
  advance), and shape to resemble real truffles. These truffles keep a
  week. To keep a longer time, substitute vegetable shortening for the
  butter.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      1    9 inch chocolate layer cake
      2 lb Semi-sweet chocolate
      8 oz White fondant
      2 c  Whipping cream
 
  With a serrated knife or thread, cut cake into two layers and place
  one layer in a 9 inch springform pan. In a double boiler, over hot
  water, melt chocolate and fondant. Or, use a microwave oven to melt
  the ingredients, allowing 12 minutes for chocolate, 20 seconds for
  fondant - medium power. Heat 1/2 cup cream to lukewarm. If using a
  microwave, allow 30 seconds. Beat the remaining chilled cream until
  it forms soft peaks; set aside. In a large bowl, combine warm cram
  with fondant and melted chocolate. Stir until ingredients are evenly
  blended and the temperature is reduced to lukewarm. Beat the soft
  chocolate mixture and gradually incorporate the whipped cream. Spoon
  one-half of the creamy chocolate mixture over cake. Top with second
  layer of cake. Complete by spreading the second half of the chocolate
  mixture over top. Refrigerate the cake for 8 to 12 hours. Serve
  chilled with whipped cream and chocolate curls. Serves 16. From The
  Gazette, 90/12/12. The recipe is from Chef Steven McKeown at the Cafe

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text only
 
  Use these instructions to complete "White Coffee Truffles,"
  "Chocolate-Hazelnut Truffles," "Mocha Truffles," and "Pistachio
  Truffles."
  
  Chill and form the truffles: 1. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
  Alternatively, freeze for 2 hours. (The mixture may be prepared in
  advance to this point and frozen for up to 3 months.) When you are
  ready to form the truffles after a long freezing, place them in the
  refrigertor overnight; otherwise, the mixture will be too firm to
  form into balls.
  
  2. Line a baking sheet with wax paper. Scoop the truffle mixture into
  rounded teaspoonfuls and drop the mounds onto the paper. Dust your
  hands with either confectioners' sugar or cocoa, and roll the mounds
  into smooth balls. Place in the freezer for 1 hour or overnight.
  
  Make the coating: 3. Place the chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe
  medium glass bowl and heat on high power for 1 minute. Stir until
  smooth. If the chocolate is still fairly solid, heat for another 30
  seconds. Stir the mixture until smooth. If there still seem to be
  several unmelted pieces of chocolate, heat again for about 20
  seconds, and then stir. Be careful, as the chocolate should not get
  too hot.
  
  4. Stir in other coating ingredient if used (ground coffee or
  praline).
  
  Coat the truffles:
  
  5. Remove truffles from the freezer. Drop a truffle into the chocolate
  coating. Using 2 forks, roll it around to coat it thoroughly, then
  lift, letting the excess chocolate drip off. Return to the baking
  sheet. If desired, use a fork to drip a thin, decorative swirl of
  choclate over the top. Repeat with the remaining truffles.
  
  6. Let the truffles set in the freezer for about 1 hour. Refrigerate
  in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks or freeze for up to 6
  months. Remove from the freezer about 20 minutes before serving.

      Title: TRUITE AU BLEU (BLUE TROUT)
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1    Shallot of scallion, minced
      1    Rib celery w/leaves/chopped
      1    Carrot, thinly sliced
      1    Dressed trout, head and all
           But cut into chunks
      1 tb Salt
      6    Peppercorns
    1/2 ts Thyme
      2 tb Minced fresh parsley
      1    Bay leaf
      3 c  Water
      1 c  White wine or dry vermouth
      3 tb Tarragon vinegar
      5    Whole 10" trout
 
  This dish is basically trout poached in a vegetable court bouillon
  flavored with a cut-up trout.  It is a lovely way to offer the
  delicacy of trout, and can be either a fish course, if the trout are
  6-8 inchers, or a main course if the trout  are 10-11 inchers. As a
  fish course for a game dinner serve    the trout cold ( in an aspic
  if you wish-see below).
  
  In a big saucepan or deep skillet with lid melt the butter and saute'
  the vegetables until the shallot is just soft.
     Add the single cut-up trout and the remaining ingredients (except
  whole trout), bring to a bubble, and simmer for ten minutes or so.
     Add the dressed whole trout, cover, and simmer slowly for about
  20-minutes.
     If the dish is a main course, remove the fish, drain, and serve
  immediately with melted butter and lemon juice or herb butter.
     If the dish is just a fish course, allow the fish to cool in the
  liquor and serve the drained trout with a slice of lemon.

      Title: TRUITE AUX AMANDES (TROUT WITH ALMONDS)
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Trout, about 8 oz each
      1    Lemon
           Salt and freshly ground
           Pepper
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      6 oz Sliced almonds
      1 tb Chopped parsley
           Parsley for garnish
 
  1.  Clean the trout as you would any roundfish and trim the tails, but
      do not scale the fish (trout have such small scales as to make
      scaling unnecessary. 2. With a small sharp knife, cut a slice off
  the top and bottom of the
      lemon.  Stand the fruit upright on a work surface and, following
  the
      contours of the fruit, use a small paring knife to cut away the
  skin
      and bitter white pith.  Cut crosswise into 6 slices 1/4 inch
  thick;
      set aside. 3. Season the trout, inside and out, with salt and
  pepper. Dip the
      trout in flour to coat completely and shake off the excess. Heat 3
      tablespoons of the butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a large
  frying
      pan over medium heat.  Add 3 trout and cook until golden brown on
      one side, 5-8 minutes.  Turn and continue cooking until golden
  brown
      and tender when the flesh is pierced with the point of a knife,
      5-8 minutes longer.  Transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm.
      Repeat to cook the 3 remaining trout. 4. Discard the butter and
  oil in the pan.  Heat the remaining 10
      tablespoons butter in the same pan over medium heat. Add the
  almonds
      and saute until golden brown.  Pour over fish. Place 1 slice of
      lemon on each trout.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley. ~--

 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    10-oz. trout
      4 qt Water
      1 c  White vinegar
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt to taste
     10    Peppercorns
           Lemon wedges
           Melted butter or
           Hollandaise Sauce
 
   Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut off the fins from the back and
  sides of the trout.  Leave the head and tail intact.
   Using a long needle such as a trussing needle, run a string through
  the eyes of the trout, then the tail. Tie the head and tail together.
  This is simply for appearance. When trout are freshly caught, they
  are killed and dressed and dropped into boiling water immediately.
  These trout will curve naturally through muscle and nerve reaction.
   Combine the water and vinegar in a fairly wide casserole. There
  should be enough liquid to cover the trout when they are added. Add
  the bay leaf, salt and peppercorns. Bring to the boil and simmer for
  10 minutes.
   Drop the trout into simmering water.  Simmer for 5 minutes. Drain the
  trout and serve with lemon wedges and hot melted butter or Hollandaise
  Sauce. The New New York Times Cookbook, by Craig Claiborne with Pierre

           -follows)
    1/4 c  Sugar
  3 1/2 ts Xanthan gum
    2/3 c  Dry milk powder
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Lukewarm water
  1 1/2    Yeast cakes, or 1 1/2
           -tablespoons yeast granules
    1/4 c  Shortening
  1 1/4 c  Water
      1 ts Vinegar
      3    Eggs
 
  Combine flour, sugar, xanthan gum, milk powder, and salt in bowl of
  heavy duty mixer.  Use your strongest beaters. Dissolve the 2
  teaspoons of sugar in the 1/2 cup of lukewarm water and mix in the
  yeast. Set aside while you combine the shortening and 1 1/4 cups
  water in saucepan and heat until shortening melts. Turn mixer on low.
  Blend dry ingredients and slowly add shortening and water mixture and
  the vinegar.  Blend, then add the eggs. This mixture should feel
  slightly warm. Pour the yeast mixture into the ingredients in the
  bowl and beat at highest speed for 2 minutes. Place mixing bowl in a
  warm place, cover with plastic wrap and a towel, and let the dough
  rise approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until doubled. Return to mixer
  and beat on high for 3 minutes. Spoon the dough into 3 small (2 1/2"
  x 5") greased loaf pans or 1 large one. Use muffin tins and bake any
  remaining as small rolls. Or make all rolls (approximately 18). Let
  rise until the dough is slightly above the top of pan. Bake in
  preheated 400 degree oven for 10 minutes. Place foil over bread and
  bake large loaves 50 minutes longer, small loaves slightly less time,
  and rolls about 25 minutes. NOTES:  The dough texture will seem more
  like cookie dough than bread dough, so don't be alarmed. Bread is
  better

 Categories: Middle east, Greek, Breads
      Yield: 1 6" rd loaf
 
      2 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Milk; lukewarm (110-115 deg)
  2 1/2 c  All purpose flour
      1 ts Salt

      8 tb Butter, unsalted; cut into

           ;shell, dyed red with food
           ;coloring
      1    Egg yolk; lightly beaten

MMMMM----------------SILVER XPRESS MAIL SYSTEM 5---------------------
 
    In a small, shallow bowl, sprinkle the yeast and the 1/2 teaspoon of
  sugar over the lukewarm milk.  Let it stand for 2 or 3 minutes, then
  stir to dissolve the yeast completely. Set the bowl in a warm, draft
  free place (such as an unlighted oven) for 8 to 10 minutes, or until
  the mixture doubles in volume.
    Combine 1 1/2 cups of flour, the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, and
  the salt in a deep mixing bowl.  Make a well in the center, and add
  the yeast and the 2 eggs. Gently stir the center ingredients together
  with a large spoon, then gradually incorporate the flour and continue
  beating until all the ingredients are well combined. beat in the 8
  tablespoons of butter and lemon peel, add up to 1 cup more flour,
  beating it n a few tablespoons at a time and using as much as
  necessary to from a dough that can be gathered into a soft and still
  somewhat sticky ball. (When the dough becomes difficult to stir
  easily, work in the flour with your fingers.)
    Place the dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead it by
  pressing it down, pushing it forward several times with the heel of
  your hand, and folding it back on itself. Repeat for about 10
  minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.  sprinkle the
  dough with a little extra flour from time to time to prevent it from
  sticking to the board.
    Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a large, lightly
  buttered bowl.  Dust the top with a little flour, drape with a
  kitchen towel and set aside in a warm, draft free place for about 1
  hour until the dough doubles in bulk.
    With a pastry brush, coat a baking sheet with the tablespoon of
  softened butter.  Punch the dough down with a single blow of your
  fist, then transfer it to a lightly floured surface. To shape the
  dough into a snail like loaf, roll it into a thick rope about 2
  inches in diameter and 24 inches long.  Starting at one end, loop the
  rope into a circle about 6 inches in diameter, and then into ever
  smaller concentric circles. Carefully transfer the loaf to the baking
  sheet and let it rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes.
    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).  Press the dyed egg gently
  into the center and brush the top of the loaf with the beaten egg
  yolk. Bake in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes, or until
  golden brown and crusty. Cool completely on a cake rack before
  serving.

      Title: TUCSON TOSTADAS
 Categories: Appetizers, Southwest
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 md Flour tortillas
           -(buy the largest
           -flour tortillas that
           -will fit in your
           -biggest frying pan)
    1/2 lb Oaxaca cheese, shredded
    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese,
           -shredded
    1/3 lb Anejo cheese, grated
    1/2 lb Poblano peppers, sliced
           -(or any other mild
           -chili pepper)
    1/4 c  Coriander (fresh),
           -chopped fine
           Lard or oil
           -for frying
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  If you are using fresh poblanos,
  roast them and remove their skins and seeds, If you are using canned
  poblanos, wash and drain them. Slice the peppers into thin decorative
  slices.
  
  In a big frying pan, fry a tortilla in lard or oil until it is golden
  brown. Remove to paper towels, drain well, then place on a baking
  sheet or pizza pan. Although lard is bad for you, the grim truth is
  that tortillas taste very much better when they have been fried in
  lard. Live dangerously.
  
  When the tortilla has cooled and hardened, cover it with a thin layer
  of Oaxaca cheese, then with the jack cheese. Crumble anejo on top of
  those layers, then sprinkle finely-chopped coriander on top of that.
  
  Arrange the pepper slices in a geometric pattern on top of the
  cheeses. Bake for 5 minutes, or until the cheese has melted but not
  browned. Remove from the oven, and use a pizza cutter to slice into
  individual portions. Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A toasted cheese tortilla snack popular in southern Arizona -- I
  first discovered this recipe in 1978 when I went to Tucson to visit my
  prospective in-laws. Such visits are often tense; Loretta's parents
  knew that I liked Mexican food, so they took me to their favorite
  restaurant, Casa Molina. The appetizer, a toasted cheese tostada, was
  so good that I forgot my nervousness and just chowed down on serving
  after serving. I think that her parents remembered from that visit
  more about my appetite than my personality.
  
  I tried several times to make Tucson tostadas, but they always ended
  up tasting like pizza.  Then a recipe appeared in the April 1986
  issue of _Sunset_ magazine, and after reading it, I was able to
  reconstruct this replica of the Tostada Casa Molina. The secret is to
  use Mexican cheeses. Yield:  Serves 6.
  
  *  Oaxaca (pronounced "oh-HOCK-a") cheese is a Mexican string cheese.
  You can substitute any Mexican cheese marked "asadero" (melting
  cheese). If you're desperate, you can use Armenian mozzarella, which
  has the right texture but the wrong flavor. Monterey jack is a bland
  American cheddar; you can substitute good-quality Muenster.
  
  *  Anejo cheese is somewhat like Parmesan, dry and crumbly. You can
  substitute Mexican cotija cheese, but that is probably pointless,
  because a store that carries cotija will probably also carry anejo.
  Fresh-ground parmesan will do in a pinch, though it is not the right
  flavor. In one of my many attempts to get this recipe right, I tried
  a mixture of Greek feta and cow's-milk romano cheese. It tasted very
  interesting, though not at all authentic.

      Title: TUFEEN HUSHANI
 Categories: Cakes, Star trek
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------VULCAN WEDDING CAKE (CARROT---------------------
      6 oz Ground almonds
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Cloves
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
      6 oz Grated carrots
      1 tb Vulcan bitter nectar*
      1 tb Grated lemon rind
      1 tb Lemon juice
      5 tb Margarine
      6 oz Sugar; a bit more than 3/4 c
      5    Eggs
 
  *Dark Jamaican rum may be used. To be made as a wedding cake, many
  rituals would have to be performed during the making of the cake.
  This is a nonritual version. Sift the ground almonds and flour
  together to make a very fine mixture. Add the salt, spices and baking
  powder and mix well. In a separate bowl put the grated carrots and
  the nectar. Add the lemon rind and juice. Cover and let stand. Cream
  the margarine and sugar together. Separate the eggs, putting the
  yolks in with the margarine and sugar and saving the whites for
  later. Beat the egg yolks in and then add the carrot mixture. Stir
  well and let sit for a few minutes. Beat the egg whites until soft
  peaks form, then set aside. Add the dry ingredients to the carrot
  mixture and mix well. You should have a thick batter. Now beat the
  egg whites a little more and fold the batter into the egg whites. Mix
  gently until it is just barely evenly mixed. Pour into a greased ring
  mold. Bake at 325 degrees for about 50 minutes. It is done when a
  skewer comes out clean. Take out of the oven and let cool for 5
  minutes. Unmold onto a serving plate dusted with confections sugar
  (this prevents the cake from sticking as much).

  they promptly made good use of it by creating pecan brittle, pecan
  pralines, pecan sauce and of course pecan pie. The first pecans I
  ever ate came from my Grandmother's pecan tree in her backyard. Every
  Christmas she would send a 50 pound gunny sack of pecans to my
  mother. My Grandmother's pecans were not those tasteless thin shelled
  kind; hers had thick shells with just as much shell as meat and 10
  times more taste.
  
  This recipe for pecan pie is from my mother's uncle whose family owned
  Tujague's restaurant in New Orleans for more than 70 years.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a glass mixing bowl beat the eggs,
  blending in the sugar, syrup, butter, vanilla, salt, Armagnac and
  pecans. Pour the mixture into the pie shell and bake 10 minutes.
  Lower the oven to 350 degrees and bake 30 minutes or until a wooden
  skewer or knife inserted into the pie comes out clean. Cool on a wire
  rack. Serves 6-8. Walt MM

      Title: TULIP COOKIE SHELLS
 Categories: Cookies, Ice cream
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Egg whites
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter, melted
      2 ts Water
      1 ts Vanilla
           Ice cream, sherbert, or
           -fresh fruit for filling
 
  Line three baking sheets with parchment paper or grease and flour
  sheets. Using a six inch plate, trace two circles on each
  sheet,leaving one inch between each circle. In large bowl, whisk
  together egg whites, sugar, flour, butter, water and vanilla just
  until blended. Using three tablespoons batter for each cookie, drop
  on to circles on prepared baking sheet. With metal spatula, gently
  spread batter as thinly as possible to fill circles.  Bake one sheet
  at a time in upper half of 400 F oven for 6-8 minutes or until edges
  are just beginning to brown. Remove baking hseet from oven and place
  on rack. Using metal spatula, immediately lift one cookie and place
  on to lightly greased inverted tall glass about 1-1/2 inches in
  diamter. Working quickly,lightly shape warm cookie with fingers to
  creat fluted effect.  Let cool completely on glass. Repeat with
  remaining cookies. If cookie is too firm to mould, return to oven for
  15-30 seconds or until softened. (Cookie shells can be stored in
  airtight container for up to two day. Recrisp in 275F oven for one
  minutes.
  
  TIP:  It is important to work quickly when shaping tulip shells
  because they're easiest to handle while still warm. If possible, line
  baking sheets with parchment paper for easy removal of the cookies.

      Title: TULIP~ CRAB~ & ASPARAGUS APPETIZERS
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Flowers
      Yield: 25 Servings
 
      3 oz Cream cheese; softened
      2 ts Lemon juice
      1 tb Minced chives
      1 ts Minced fresh dill or mint
           -(Optional)
      1 ds Pepper or cayenne
      1 c  Crab meat, flaked
     25    Fresh asparagus spears
     25    Tulip petals
 
  In a medium bowl, beat cheese with lemon juice, herbs, and pepper;
  stir in crab. Break tough ends off asparagus. Blanch in 1 inch of
  boiling water in a large skillet with a lid, or steam standing
  upright in a couple of inches of water in a tall, narrow pot, until
  crisp-tender, 2 to 5 minutes, depending on thickness of stems.
  Plunge into an ice-water bath for 1 minute; then pat dry.  Trim
  asparagus to abut 5 inches; from the trimmings, cut as many 1/4-inch
  rounds as you have tulip petals. Save extra ends for salads. Fill
  each tulip petal with about 1/2 a rounded teaspoon of crab mixture
  and garnish with an asparagus round. (If your petals are large and
  asparagus thin, you can use 3 rounds to garnish each filled petal.)
  Arrange asparagus in a fan on a serving platter and place tulip
  petals alternately (or create your own pattern).

      Title: TUMOR CHICKEN
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Or 2 roasting chickens
           Garlic cloves
 
  Peel the garlic cloves (leaving them whole) and after loosening the
  skin of the birds insert them under the skin, using as many as you
  like, but at least 6-7 cloves for each bird. I use a Weber, and build
  an indirect pile against one side of the grill, meanwhile have
  several chunks of Hickory soaking in water, when the coals are ready,
  put the hickory on, brush with soy sauce if you like,(not necessary)
  Put the birds on the opposite side from the coals, adjust the vents
  and go about your business. Usually takes about 2 hours.
  
  I realize that this is not really smoke cooking and therefore may be
  outside the scope of this group, but if you make and eat it I think
  you will be happy to add it to your repetoire.

      Title: TUNA
 Categories: Fish, Canning
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  Tuna may be canned either precooked or raw. Preooking removes most of
  the strong-flavored oils. The strong flavor of dark tuna flesh
  affects the delicate flavor of white flesh. Many people prefer not to
  can dark flesh. It may be used as pet food.
  
  Note: Glass-like crystals of magnesium ammonium phosphate sometimes
  form in canned tuna. There is no way for the home canner to prevent
  these crystals from forming, but they usually dissolve when heated
  and are safe to eat.
  
  Procedure: Keep tuna on ice until ready to can. Remove viscera and
  wash fish well in cold water. Allow blood to drain from stomach
  cavity. Place fish belly down on a rack or metal tray in the bottom
  of a large baking pan. Cut tuna in half crosswise, if necessary.
  Precook fish by baking at 250 degrees F for 2-1/2 to 4 hours
  (depending on size) or at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. The fish may also
  be cooked in a steamer for 2 to 4 hours. If a thermometer is used,
  cook to a 165 to 175 degree F internal temperature. Refrigerate
  cooked fish overnight to firm the meat. Peel off the skin with a
  knife, removing blood vessels and any discolored flesh. Cut meat away
  from bones; cut out and discard all bones, fin bases, and dark flesh.
  Quarter. Cut quarters crosswise into lengths suitable for half-pint
  or pint jars. Fill into jars, pressing down gently to make a solid
  pack. Tuna may be packed in water or oil, whichever is preferred. Add
  water or oil to jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 1/2 teaspoon of
  salt per half-pint or 1 teaspoon of salt per pint, if desired.
  
  Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or
  Table 2 according to the canning method used.
  
  Table 1. Recommended process time for Tuna in a dial-gauge pressure
  canner.
  
  Jar Size: Pints and Half-pints. Process Time: 100 minutes. Canner

 Categories: Faylen, Seafood

      2    Tuna steaks, 6-8 oz each,
           " thick
           -flour to dust the tuna
      3 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Port
      2 tb Finely minced shallots
    1/4 c  Whole cranberry sauce
      2 tb Demi-glaze or brown sauce
           -(see Note.)
           -zest from 1 orange, finely
           -julienned
    1/4 c  Cream
           -Dust tuna steaks lightly
           -with flour.
           -Melt 1/2 the butter over
           -medium-high heat.
 
  Pan-fry the tuna for 1 minutes each side or until brown. Remove the
  fish and increase the heat to high. Deglaze the pan by pouring in the
  port. Add the shallots, cranberry sauce, demiglaze and orange zest
  and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to simmer and add cream. Return
  the tuna steaks to braise for 4 minutes. Remove the tuna to dinner
  plates and continue to reduce the sauce for an additional 2-3
  minutes. Swirl in the remaining butter and pour the sauce over the
  tuna. Serves 2. Note: Demi-glaze is a refinement on the brown sauce
  used by professional chefs. It is available in the gourmet section of
  some supermarkets. A quality brown or espagnole sauce, homemade or
  commercial, may be substituted. My note: According to Larousse
  Gastronomique, demi-glaze, espagnole sauce, and brown sauce require a
  lot of work. If you're not a gourmet cook, I'd say it would be
  reasonable to substitute a good-quality beef stock (not bouillon!)
  Chicken stock, if you prefer, would probably work. Just make sure
  it's a low-salt. It looks like the thing these sauces have in common
  is the strong taste of the meat they were made from, and little of
  anything else.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 oz Egg noodles
      1 pk Frozen peas (10 oz)
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup (8oz)
      1 c  Milk
      1 cn Tuna,drained (12 1/2 oz)
    1/2 c  Plain or seasoned bread
           -crumbs tossed with

           -or
    1/2 c  Crushed Ritz crackers
           -tossed with
      3 tb Melted butter or margarine
 
  Heat the oven to 375'F. with the rack in the center position. Grease

  ovenproof baking dish, or two smaller dishes.
  
  Cook the noodles according to the directions on the package, but
  shorten the cooking time by 2 minutes. Drain the noodles and combine
  with the peas, soup and milk. Mash the tuna with a fork to break it
  up and add it to the noodles. Mix gently and spoon into prepared pan.
  Sprinkle the crumbs over the top and bake for 35 minutes, until hot.
  
  Variations: Add salt (taste first, as soup may be salted enough);
  freshly grated black pepper; white pepper; snipped fresh herbs, such
  as tarragon, or dried herbs. Also, if you're not an avid fan of bread
  crumbs, 2 cups may be too much. Toss 1/2 to 3/4 cups with 1
  tablespoon melted butter or margarine for a light sprinkling.

           Text Only
 
  Here's my favorite recipe for tuna.
  
  1. Buy (or preferably, catch) fresh tuna.
  
  2. slice and reserve.
  
  3. Mix wasabi powder with soy sauce
  
  4. Heat sake
  
  5. Eat.
  
  NOTE:  You may substitute any fresh, firm white or red fleshed fish,
  up to and including chicken for the tuna.
  
  Rice is nice with this dish, though that does bring the over-all prep
  time up close to a half hour.  ;-}

  tomatoes into flat slices; lay each slice flat. Cut lengthwise into
  1/4-inch strips, pile strips; cut horizontally in 1/4-inch pieces.
  Reserve on a plate in refrigerator, covered. Chill 4 plates. In a
  small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine juice, 1 tablespoon
  green peppercorns and salt. Bring to boil and reduce until only 2/3
  cup remains. The mixture should be thick and syrupy. Transfer liquid
  to bowl and cool to room temperature. When cool, beat in oil to make
  "glaze." If the mixture has a very shiny appearance and seems like
  it's going to separate, add a few drops of water or orange juice. To
  serve, spoon glaze onto plates. Arrange sliced fish on top. Garnish
  with the orange sections, the remaining tablespoon of green
  peppercorns and the chopped tomato.

    1/4 c  Orange-juice concentrate
      1 tb Chopped fresh thyme
      1 ts Soy sauce

  of tuna and marinate for 20 minutes.
  
  Grill tuna on an oiled rack set about 5 to 6 inches over glowing
  coals 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare fish. (Alternatively,

  each new piece before previous one has melted completely. (Do not
  allow sauce to simmer. Sauce should not get hot enough to separate.)

  overcook. Remove from the heat and place the steaks on warmed dinner
  plates.
  
  Spoon the strawberry salsa over the tuna, garnish each with a sprig of
  basil and serve immediately.

  grill the tuna steaks as directed above. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in
  a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add to the skillet 1/2 cup
  each: Diced fresh banana, pineapple, mango and papaya with 2
  tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon
  juice and 1 tablespoon sugar. Saute just until the mixture is heated
  through - about 30 seconds. Do not overcook.  Season to taste with
  salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon the sauteed fruit mixture
  over the tuna and serve immediately.

      Title: TUNNEL OF FUDGE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  3 1/2    Sticks butter or margarine,
           -softened (14 oz)
  1 3/4 c  Sugar
      6    Eggs
  2 3/4 c  Powdered sugar
  2 1/4 c  Flour
      1 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
      2 c  Chopped walnuts (8 oz.) **
  1 1/2 tb (to 2 Tbsp.) milk
 
  "In 1966 a chocolate cake called the Tunnel of Fudge Cake, made with a
  boxed frosting mix, won the Pillsbury BAKE-OFF Contest. Although the
  frosting mix was discontinued, Pillsbury continued to receive so many
  requests for the cake that the company developed a scratch recipe to
  simulate the original.  Here it is:"
  
  1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 12-cup bundt pan or 10"
  angel food tube pan.  Dust with flour; tap out excess. 2. In a large
  bowl, beat together butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium
  speed until light and fluffly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a
  time, beating well after each addition. Gradually add 2 cups powdered
  sugar, beating until well blended.  By hand, stir in flour, 3/4 cup
  cocoa, and nuts; mix until well blended. Spoon batter into prepared
  pan and spread evenly. 3. Bake 58 to 62 minutes.  Since this cake has
  a soft tunnel of fudge, ordinary doneness test cannot be used.
  Accurate oven temperature and baking time are critical.  Let cake
  cool upright in pan on a rack for 1 hour; then invert onto serving
  plate and let cool completely. 4. To make glaze, in a small bowl,
  combine remaining 3/4 cup powdered sugar, remaining 1/4 cup cocoa,
  and milk. Mix until well blended. Spoon glaze over top of cool cake,
  allowing some to run down sides. Store cake tightly covered.
  
  ** Nuts are essential for the success of this recipe.

  stock to cover. Cover and bring to a boil. Simmer, covered, until
  fennel is tender, approximately fifteen minutes. Chill in stock over
  ice and set aside. Preparation of the Confit Tomatoes: Preheat oven
  to 275 degrees. Boil the tomatoes in water for ten seconds then peel
  and quarter them. Place in a pan with the salt, oil, thyme, and
  garlic. Cook at a low temperature for three to four hours or until
  tomatoes are half their original size. Reserve in the oil.
  Preparation of the Preserved Lemon Zest: Zest the lemons with no pith

  Strain through a cheese cloth and cool. Preparing the Sauce: Reduce
  the turbot stock to 1/3 of a gallon and add 1/4 cup of the syrup from
  the candied lemon. Season with sea salt and white pepper. Reserve
  warm. Presenting the Dish: Season the fillets with salt and white
  pepper and sear in a hot pan with olive oil. Warm the fennel, olives,
  tomatoes, and basil with a few strips of the lemon, finish with
  extra-virgin olive oil and serve under the fillets of turbot.

  Heat oil in heavy pan.  Add onions and fry until golden brown. Add
  garlic, ginger and all spices except salt. Fry for 5 minutes until
  fragrant. If mixture is too dry add a little water.  Stir regularly
  to prevent burning. Add lamb and toss through to coat with
  onion/spices. Fry further 10 minutes, stirring to prevent
  burning/sticking. Add thawed spinach and mix thoroughly.  Add coconut
  cream and salt.  Stir well. Add curry leaves, bring to a rapid boil.
  Reduce heat and allow to simmer for at least 1.5 hours covered.

  reduce by half the following ingredients: chilli powder and hot
  paprika.
  
  This recipe also lends itself to substituting chicken for the lamb.

      Title: TURKEY & CHILE SOUP
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     16 oz Can of tomatoes
      7 oz Can of diced green chiles
      1    Onion, cut into chunks
      3 c  Chicken broth or
           -homemade turkey stock
      3 c  Bite-size pieces of
           -cooked turkey
      2 c  Cooked brown rice
     10 oz Pk frozen whole kernel corn
    3/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Garlic salt
    1/4 ts Chili powder
 
  This is a recipe that I like to use for turkey leftovers. I use the
  carcass to make the stock first. I throw in any vegetables I want to
  use up in the fridge into the stock pot except cabbage and broccoli
  and carrot greens which smell too strong if I let the stock boil too
  hard by accident. After straining the stock and discarding the bones
  and vegetables I use the following recipe from the Sunset "Fresh Ways
  with Chicken" cookbook, which I usually double.  I also use more
  broth and less turkey than they call for, I really don't measure the
  ingredients, I just add what I've got until it's as thick as I want
  it and the proportions look right.
  
  In a blender or food processor combine tomatoes and their liquid,
  chiles and onion; whirl until smooth. Pour into a large pan, add
  broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add turkey, rice, corn,
  garlic and spices. Reduce heat and simmer until heated through.
  
  Serve with fresh cilantro, sour cream and tortilla strips, their
  recipe calls for strips made from flour tortillas, but I use corn
  tortilla chips sometimes. ~- Sandra Chaffin (fnsjc@aurora.alaska.edu)

    1/2 c  Fresh cilantro; finely chop
      1 sm Red onion; finely chop
           Cornbread for serving
 
  Place the pinto beans in a medium saucepan and add 6 cups of water.
  Bring to a boil over moderately high heat and boil for 3 minutes.
  Remove from the heat and let stand for 1 hour.
  
  In a medium bowl, soak the ancho and guajillo chiles in 3 cups of hot
  water until softened, about 20 minutes. Pour off the soaking liquid,
  reserving 1-1/2 cups. Stem and seed the chilies and transfer them to
  a food processor or blender with the reserved soaking liquid. Puree
  until smooth. Pass the puree through a fine strainer into a small
  bowl.
  
  Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large enameled cast-iron casserole.
  Season the turkey with salt and pepper. Add some of the meat to the
  casserole in a single layer and cook over moderately high heat until
  well browned all over, about 4 minutes.  Transfer the cooked turkey
  to a large plate and brown the remaining meat in batches.
  
  Heat 1 more tablespoon of the olive oil in the casserole. Add the
  onion and garlic and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally,
  until translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add the cumin, curry, thyme,
  cinnamon and nutmeg and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2
  minutes. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil over moderately
  high heat. Boil until reduced by 1/4, about 6 minutes.
  
  Return the turkey to the casserole and add the pureed chiles, chopped
  tomato, tomato paste, sugar and bay leave. Bring to a boil over
  moderately high heat. Lower the theat and simmer until the turkey is
  tender, about 1 hour.  Discard the bay leaves.
  
  Meanwhile, drain the pinto beans and return them to the pan. Add 6
  more cups of water and bring to a boil over moderately high heat.
  Lower the heat, cover partially and simmer until tender, about 1
  hour. Drain the beans and add them to the chili.
  
  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet until
  almost smoking.  Add the green and yellow bell peppers and cook over
  moderately high heat, stirring, until browned, about 3 minutes.
  Transfer to paper towels to drain, then stir them into the chili.
  
  Stir in half the cilantro into the chili and season with salt. Spoon
  the chili into bowls.  Garnish with the red onion and the remaiing
  cilantro and serve with corn bread.

      1    Bunch of rocket, discarding
           The coarse stem ends
      1 sm Soft lettuce
    250 g  Macadamia nuts
      2 cl Garlic, chopped

    100 ml Macadamia oil
     50 ml White wine vinegar
      1 lb Turkey, sliced
           Chives
 
      Turkey meat, which tends to be dry, benefits particularly from
  this macadamia dressing, but any roast poultry meat you have left
  over can be used instead. Another soft lettuce can stand in for the
  rocket (arugula) if you simply can't obtain the latter, but it won't
  provide the delicate, savoury flavour. Macadamia oil can now be
  obtained in some supermarkets.
      Arrange the leaves on four plates.
  
      Heat 250 g macadamia nuts in an ungreased container in the oven
  until they smell appetizing, then set half aside and tip the other
  half into the bowl of a food processor. Add: 2 garlic cloves, roughly
  chopped. With salt and pepper process to a paste.
   With the food processor.running, slowly add 100 ml macadamia oil,
  then 50 ml white wine vinegar.
  
      Slice or shred enough turkey for four people and gently loss it
  in the macadamia salad.
  
      Arrange the dressed turkey on the prepared plates, drizzle
  left-over dressing over the salad leaves, Sprinkle with reserved
  macadamia nuts, roughly chopped, and finely chopped chives. Serve.

           Turkey
      2 c  Apple juice or cider
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
           Salt
           Pepper

  From: hiller@smartlink.net (Mimi & JB Hiller) Newsgroups:
  rec.food.cooking
  
  Season the outside with salt, pepper and paprika, then into the pan
  breast side DOWN.  Combine 2 cups apple juice or cider with 1/2 cup
  soy sauce and pour that in the pan. Into the oven, then start basting
  it after 1 hour. Baste every 20-30 min.  When a thermometer inserted
  into the thickest part of the thigh reaches 165F, remove from oven
  and tent with foil for at least 30 min.  (If the liquid runs out,
  make up more baste. You want to have plenty for the gravy.)
  
  And I have the perfect turkey, that even looks like the perfect
  turkey, first time, every time.
  
  And beyond that, you should taste the gravy that this basting sauce
  makes.

  gravy!!! And cooking it breast side down makes for the juiciest
  turkey breast you have ever tasted.

  boiling stock.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
  
  5.  Remove the cooked albondigas with a slotted spoon and set aside.
  
  6.  Boil the stock for another 30 minutes to reduce and thicken it.

           -for garnish (opt)
      1 sm Ripe avacado, sliced, for
           -garnish (opt)
 
  It's necessary to highly season turkey because the meat itself tastes
  rather mild. Yet, once ground turkey is cooked up, it's delicious. To
  do a taste test on the mixture, make a little patty the size of a
  silver dollar and pan-fry it in a nonstick skillet. This way you can
  adjust your seasonings to taste. A mayonnaise-type dressing and
  avacado make perfect toppings.
  
  1. Prepare hot coals for grilling.
  
  2. Place the ground turkey in a bowl and mix well with the scallions,
  bell pepper, garlic, cilantro and spices. Season to taste with salt
  and pepper. Gently form into 4 patties.
  
  3. Grill patties over hot coals, 3" from heat, for about 5-6 minutes
  per side.
  
  4. If desired, spread buns with mayonnaise-type dressing and top
  burgers with avacado slices. Serve immediately.

      Title: TURKEY BREAST
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Turkey breast
           Pepper
           Canola oil
           Salt
           Cayene pepper
 
  * Keep the skin on. Even thought it has the fat, it will keep the meat
  moister. Slather the skin with the canola oil. It will help with the
  browning. Most of the oil will dissipate during cooking. Sprinkle the
  breast with salt, Black pepper, and Cayenne pepper. Place the Roast
  on the grill with a moderate charcoal fire and cover. It will take
  about 1 hour to cook a 2-3 lb breast. As always check it after the
  hour and adjust. For those who are not fat intimidated, use butter
  instead of oil and add a little hickory wood for smoke. The skin will
  have a distinctive bacon flavor. Submitted By KEN HAYCOOK

      2    Matzot; regular*
  1 1/2 c  Chicken broth;cold
  1 1/2 lb Ground turkey breast -OR:
  1 1/2 lb Turkey breast; cubed*
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 ts -salt
    1/4 ts -freshly ground black pepper
      1 ds Nutmeg
      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Sage; dried -OR:
      2    -large fresh sage leaves
      1    Garlic clove;large
    1/2 ts Rosemary;dried, wrapped in
           -cheesecloth
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
      2    Eggs;slightly beaten
           Matza meal*
      3    Egg yolks
 
  *Matzots and mastza meal may be bought in Jewish grocery stores and
  many supermarkets *The recipe calls for cubes of turkey breast to be
  ground; however I think a substitution of pre ground turkey would be
  acceptable
  
  Break matzot directly into a shallow bowl and pour broth over them.
  In a large saucepan, place meat and oil and season with salt, pepper
  and nutmeg. Add bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary and saute,
  stirring frequently until meat is dark brown on all sides. (If dried
  sage is used, enclose it in the cheesecloth with the rosemary.If you
  using ground turkey, add garlic and bay leaf to this cheesecloth
  bundle). Transfer meat to a dish to cool. Remove and discard bay
  leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary. Add nuts to saucepan with oil and
  saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain excess liquid from the matzot, but do
  not squeeze dry. Add soaked matzot to the saucepan and turn heat off.
  If using cubed turkey breast, grind it now and return to the
  saucepan. Add beaten eggs and mix thoroughly. Oil a 9 inch cake pan
  and sprinkle with matza meal. Pour meat mixture into it; level it
  with a spatula. With a small ladle, make three depressions near the
  centre and place 1 egg yolk in each depression. Bake in 375F oven for
  1/2 hour.

      Title: TURKEY BREAST PINWHEELS
 Categories: Sun-dried, Poultry, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12 lg Flour tortillas
      8 oz Pkg cream cheese; soft
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine; soft
    1/4 ts Fresh lemon juice
    1/4 ts Ground white pepper
           Sprigs of fresh dill; or
           Dill pickles; cut thin
           -spears
      1 lg Pk moist smoked salmon;
           -thinly sliced
 
  Mix together cream cheese, butter, pepper, and lemon juice. (I do
  this in the food processor). Spread the tortillas, one at a time,
  with this mixture. Lay the smoked salmon slices, slightly
  overlapping, over the cream cheese mixture, leaving one edge of the
  cream cheese uncovered (this acts as the "glue" to hold the tortilla
  together when rolled.) Lay fresh dill sprigs or dill pickle spears
  down one edge; starting with this edge, roll up tightly, "gluing"
  tortilla together at the end with the uncovered edge of cream cheese.
  Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill, at least one hour or up to 24
  hours.  When ready to serve, unwrap and slice about 1/2" thick on a
  slight diagonal. TURKEY BREAST PINWHEELS WITH SUNDRIED TOMATO SPREAD
  Same as above, except substitute very thinly sliced turkey breast for
  the salmon, omit lemon juice from cream cheese mixture and add 1/4
  cup oil packed sundried tomatoes, finely chopped; use watercress in
  place of dill. You may have tortillas left over, use the amount of
  spread for each which gives a uniform covering with no tortilla
  showing through, but also not to thick!! If you like capers, they are
  wonderful added to the spread for the Salmon pinwheels. (wrv)

      2    Bell Peppers diced 1" cube
      1 md Onion, diced 1" cube
      1 lg Can pineapple chunks
     10 lg Mushrooms
 
  * Make sure the Kabob swords fit your grill. Either they should fit
  entirely inside the grill or long enough to place across the lip of
  the cooker like a rotisserie. This way the meat and vegetables will
  cook evenly. * Make a moderate fire.
  
  Dice all of the turkey breast, onion, and bell peppers. Alternate red
  and green peppers to make a nice presentation. Use the pineapple
  juice to marinate the mushrooms for about an hour. Thread the meat
  and vegetables on the swords as you think will make a good
  presentation. Cook over the fire until the meat is done. Baste with
  the pineapple juice while cooking. Serve with white rice. Submitted

      2 tb Mole sauce
    1/8 ts Salt
      2    Puff pastery sheets
      1    Egg, beaten with 2 T water
 
  Preparation Time: 20 minutes Cooking Time: 10 minutes
  
  [Note:  serving size is the number of peices this recipe will yield,
  not the number of people it will serve.]
  
  1. Combine filling ingredients together in a small bowl.
  
  2. Heat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  3. If necessary, roll out puff pastery slightly to be able to cut 12
  3-inch circles from each sheet using a cookie cutter or the rim of a
  glass.
  
  4. Place 1 T of filling on half of a puff pastry circle. Brush entire
  edge of circle with egg mixture. Fold pastry over yo form half-moon
  and grimp edges clsed with a fork. Repeat with ther rest of the
  circles.
  
  5. Brush pstreis with remaining egg wash. Bake until golden brown,
  about 10 minutes.
  
  [Another Note:  I assume the ground turkey is "Cooked Turkey" ground
  up, not the hamburger like stuff you get in the stores.]

  My note: Remove bones from turkey or chicken before serving and
  refrigerate or freeze until you have time to prepare the soup. I like
  to do it the next day, if possible, and make a batch of crackers
  while the soup is cooking.
  
  STOCK: In stockpot or large saucepan, combine bones, water, bay leaf,
  celery and onion. (Skin and drippings may be included, if desired.)
  Simmer, covered about 4 hours. Strain, reserving stock. Let bones
  cool, pick out any meat and add to the stock.
  
  SOUP: In stockpot or saucepan, bring stock to boil; add noodles and
  simmer for 5 minutes. Add celery, carrot, green onions, zucchini,
  basil and thyme. Simmer for 10 minutes.  Stir in hot pepper sauce,
  season with salt and pepper to taste.  Makes about 4
      1/2    cups.

      Title: TURKEY QUESADILLAS WITH AVOCADO CREAM
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           TURKEY QUESADILLAS-----
      8    Flour tortillas -- 7"
      4 oz Cheese, jack -- shredded
      1 c  Turkey, cooked -- shredded
      4 lg Mushrooms -- thinly sliced
    1/4 c  Red Bell peppers -- diced
      4    Green onions
      2 tb Parsley -- finely chopped
           AVOCADO CREAM-----
      1    Avocadoes
      2 tb Lime juice
    1/2 c  Yogurt
           Salt -- to taste
           GARNISH-----
      2    Limes
           Cilantro sprigs
 
  Trim green onions of roots and all but 2" of green, then slice very
  thinly.
  
  Place half of tortillas on work surface and sprinkle each with 1/2 oz
  cheese, making sure it is evenly distributed over the tortilla
  surface. Scatter 1/4 c shredded turkey over each tortilla, then
  sprinkle each evenly with mushrooms, red bell pepper, green onions,
  and parsley. Divide remaining cheese among the tortillas, covering
  each with 1/2 oz cheese. Top each with 1 remaining tortilla, creating
  a sandwich. Press down on tortillas with the palm of your hand.
  
  Make Avocado Cream: peel and seed avocado, then cut into large pieces.
  Process ingredients in food processor until completely smooth. Scrape
  into bowl; salt to taste and serve. Makes 1/4 c per serving.
  
  Heat dry nonstick skillet over medium heat until very hot. Using large
  spatula, place a quesadilla in skillet. Pressing down with spatula,
  cook until cheese melts and tortilla browns slightly, about 2-3
  minutes per side; remove from skillet. Repeat process with remaining
  quesadillas.
  
  Cut each quesadilla into quarters and serve immediately, garnished
  with quartered limes, cilantro sprigs, and a dollop of Avocado Cream.
  
  There's barely any cooking needed for these quesadillas once the
  ingredients are placed between the tortillas. All it takes is a quick
  saute in a dry skillet to finish up this delicious dish. My refined
  Avocado Cream on top is a lovely contrast to the crispy tortillas. If
  desired, serve a bowl of your favorite salsa alongside.

      2 lg Carrots, sliced
      2    Stalks celery (& tops),
           Chopped
      1 cn (12 oz) no salt green
           Beans, drained
      2 qt Boiling water
           Any peels, root ends and
           Leafy tops left over from -
           Onions, celery, potatoes,
           Carrots
           Several bruised garlic
           Cloves
     12 oz Wide egg noodles
      1 cn (12 oz) no salt corn,
           Drained
      1 lg White onion, chopped
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
    Cut wings off carcass and cut up the remaining bird as you would a
  chicken for frying.  Place the carcass pieces and any left over
  peelings & parings into a stock pot and fill with water. Add garlic
  cloves. Fill the stock pot with water and bring to a boil. Reduce
  heat to a simmer and let it cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.
  Remove from heat to cool cover and refrigerate overnight.  The next
  day remove the congealed fat from the top of the broth.  Drain the
  contents through a collander into another large pot. Return the broth
  to the stock pot. Go through the collander and remove vegetable &
  garlic pieces and discard. Next, go through the turkey remnants and
  pull out all the meat and add to the stock pot. Add any left over
  vegetables, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and the onion to the
  pot.  There should be *just* enough liquid to cover the contents.
  Place over heat and bring to a boil. While you're waiting, cook the
  egg noodles per package directions and drain. Simmer the soup just
  long enough to cook the carrots. Add 2 quarts of water, egg noodles
  and left over gravy. Adjust seasonings (salt & pepper).  Stir well,
  let simmer long enough to heat noodles and serve.
  
  Makes a bunch!

      Title: TURKEY ROAST
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  Allow 1 lb. per person.  Rinse bird and pat dray with paper toweling.
  Remove bag of organs and discard. Rub inside of cavities with salt if
  desired.  Do not stuff the bird until just before cooking. Soon some
  of the stuffing loosely into the neck cavity; pull the neck skin to
  the back of the bird and fasten securely with a small skewer. Lightly
  spoon remaining stuffing into the body cavity. If the opening has a
  band of skin across the tail, tuck the drumsticks under the bank; if
  the band of skin is not present, tie legs securely tothe tail. Twist
  wing tips under back. For an unstuffed bird, place quartered onions
  and celery in the body cavity, if desired.  Prepare and roast.
  Discard vegetables after roasting bird, if desired. The onions taste
  good though. Place bird, breast-side up, on a rack in a shallow
  roasting pan. Brush skin of bird, except duckling and goose, with
  cooking oil or spray with Pam. If a meat thermometer is used, insert
  it in the center of the inside thigh muscle, making sure the bulb
  does not touch bone.  Cover the bird loosely with foil. Press lightly
  over the drumsticks and neck; leave an air space between bird and
  foil. When the bird is about two-thirds done, cut the band or string
  between the legs so thighs will cook evenly. Baste bird occasionally;
  if desired. Uncover the last 45 minutes of cooking. Continue roasting
  until bird is done. Remove bird from oven and recover loosely with
  foil to keep warm. Let stand 15 minutes before carving. The meat
  thermometer inserted in the thigh should register 185 degrees. Also
  the thickest part of the drumstick should feel very soft when pressed
  between the fingers. The drumstick also should move up and down and
  twist easily in the socket. As each bird differs in size, shape or
  variety, mroasting times can be only approximate.

  vinegars, soy sauce, and mustard in bowl; whisk well. Slowly drizzle
  in peanut and sesame oil, whisking constantly until dressing is
  slightly thick.
  
  In bowl, toss turkey with black pepper and 1/3 c dressing. Use more
  dressing if desired.  Reserve remaining dressing for another use.

  are easy enough to prepare with a sharp knife, and the results are
  elegant and decorative when arranged atop the dressed turkey.

      Title: TURKEY SCALLOPINE
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    6 ounce Turkey Escalopes
      1    Glass Sparkling Muscatel
           -grape juice or vermouth
      5 fl Double Cream
           Salt and Pepper
      1 tb Oil
      1 tb Butter
 
  Wrap the escalopes in clingfilm and flatten gently with the back of a
  heavy frying pan until they are really thin. Peel off the clingfilm.
  
  Heat the oil then the butter in a large frying pan. Put in the meat
  and press down firmly so it is all in contact with the frying pan.
  
  Let it sizzle for between one minute and a minute and a half,
  depending on how thin you've managed to flatten the escalopes, turn
  them over and repeat the timing.
  
  The meat will be thoroughly cooked through - you do not ever want pink
  turkey - but very tender. Put the meat on warmed plates.
  
  Pour the grape juice or vermouth into the frying pan, stir it round
  to pick up all the bits from the meat, then add the double cream and
  let it bubble (double cream boils beautifully) and reduce slightly.
  
  Pour it over the turkey and serve with pasta or new potatoes and
  mangetout.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lg Turkey Thighs
    1/2 c  Vinegar
    1/4 c  Oil
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Parsley flakes
    1/4 ts Poultry seasoning
      2 tb Clover honey
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Peel the skin from the turkey thighs, remove thigh bone. Feel meat
  for any remaining cartilage and remove. Section thighs into major
  muscle groups and slice across the grain of the muscles into strips
  approx. 1/4" wide by 1-2" long.  Use all the turkey possible,
  discarding any mucous tissue and fat. Place turkey strips in a
  coverable container and add all ingredients. Shake well and
  refrigerate for several hours, or overnight if possible. GRILLING:
  Obtain a 'small fry' sheet for your grill.. an enamel sheet that sets
  on top of the grill and allows you to cook small items. Heat well,
  put all of turkey on sheet and use a spatula to turn often. Cook on
  high approx. 20 minutes, until strips are golden brown nuggets and
  firm to the touch (sample sample sample!) STIR-FRY: Add 1/2 tsp. of
  liquid smoke to marinade. Stir fry in large pan or wok in hot oil,
  stirring until flesh is firm and browned. SERVE: Serve plain, on rice
  or noodles, with BBQ sauce or any other favorite, or in a bread,
  hoagie or steak roll, or pita sandwich. Mmmm, delicious! Flavor and
  texture remind you of steak.. but it's lean, no fat turkey with no

  1. Place each turkey steak between sheets of waxed paper and pound

      Title: TURKEY TASSO
 Categories: Cajun, Poultry, Low-cal
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Onion powder
      2 tb Ground black pepper
      1 tb Ground white pepper
      1 tb Ground cumin
      2 tb Liquid smoke
      2 tb Granulated garlic
      2 tb Ground red pepper
      2 tb Paprika
      2 ts Salt
      3 lb Skinned & boned turkey brea
 
  In a small bowl, combine the sugar, garlic, onion powder, red, white,
  and black peppers, paprika, salt and cumin, mixing well. Place the
  turkey breast in a large glass bowl and sprinkle with 4 Tbsp of the
  mixture, coating well.  (store the remainder of the seasoning mix the
  a tight container for future use)
  
  Sprinkle the turkey with the liquid smoke, rubbing the seasoning mix
  and liquid over the entire breast. Cover the bowl and marinate for
  two(2) days in the refrigerator, turning occasionally.
  
  Light the fire in a charcoal water smoker, cover, and let the heat and
  smoke accumulate.  When the smoker is ready, place the turkey breast
  on the wire rack and smoke for 7 hours. Add water as needed. Add a
  few mesquite chips every hour or so.  When the tasso is done, remove
  and set aside until cool enough to handle. You will note it is very
  dry, almost like jerky. Don't worry, that's normal.  Store it in
  freezer bags up to one month in the refrigerator or six months in the
  freezer.
  
  note: This is not something you will really want to make a sandwich
  from. It is used primarily in gumbo, red beans, stuffings and some
  pasta dishes.
   It has a very pronounced flavor.  Basically, it can be used in place
  of smoked ham hocks or the like.  I like it by itself, but then I've
  been accused of having no taste buds left in my mouth because of the
  hot food I love to consume.

  THAWING TURKEY: 1). Thaw in original bag on tray in refrigerator for
  3-4 days (24 hours for each 5 lbs).
   2). For faster thawing, cover turkey in original bag with cold water
  and change the water frequently (30 minutes per pound).
   3). After turkey is thawed, remove the neck and giblets stored
  inside the turkey. Wash turkey, inside and out; drain well.
   4). Store fresh thawed turkey in refrigerator no longer than 2 days
  before cooking it.
   5). Always wash hands, utensils, sink, dishcloths and anything that
  touches the raw turkey with very hot, soapy water to avoid
  contaminating other food with bacteria.
  
  PREPARING & STUFFING THE BIRD: 1). Rub the cavity of the turkey
  lightly with salt, if desired, but do not salt the cavity if the
  turkey is to be stuffed.
   2). Stuff turkey just before roasting, not ahead of time! 3). Dry
  stuffing ingredients can be mixed ahead of time if tightly covered.
  Toss moist ingredients just before stuffing.
   4). Fill wishbone area with stuffing first. Fasten neck skin to back
  with skewer.
   5). Fold wings across back with tips touching.
   6). Stuffing expands as it cooks, so stuff body cavity lightly.
   7). Tuck drumsticks under band of skin or tail, or tie skewer to
  tail.
  
  ROASTING TIPS: 1). Place turkey, breast side up, on rack in shallow
  roasting pan. Roast in 325~ oven.
   2). Use tent of foil over turkey when it begins to turn golden brown.
   3). If using a dark covered enamel pan, roast covered. Remove lid
  during last 1/2 hour if further browning is desired.
   4). When turkey is 2/3's done, remove skewer or band holding legs.
   5). Using a meat thermometer is the best way to insure doneness. When
  placed in the thickest part of inside thigh muscle or the thickest
  part of breast meat, it should read 185~ when done. (Thermometer
  should not touch bone.) 6). When turkey is done, let stand 20 minutes
  for easiest carving.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Turkey; 10 To 12 Lbs
           Butter Or Margarine; Melted
           Southwest Stuffing

MMMMM---------------------SOUTHWEST STUFFING--------------------------
      1 c  Chayote; Chopped, 1 Small
      4    Jalapeno Chiles; *
      2    Cloves Garlic;Finely Chopped
      1 c  Onion; Finely Chopped, 1 Lg
      1 c  Margarine Or Butter; Melted
      1 tb Fresh Cilantro; Snipped
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Thyme Leaves; Dried
    1/2 ts Sage Leaves; Dried
      9 c  Corn Bread; 1-inch cubes
      1 c  Pecans; Chopped
 
  Prepare Southwest Stuffing.  Fill wishbone area of the turkey with
  stuffing.  Fasten neck skin to back with skewer. Fold wings across
  back with tips touching. Fill body cavity lightly. (Do not pack as
  stuffing will expand.)  Tuck drumsticks under band of skin at tail or
  skewer to tail. Spoon any remaining stuffing into a small ungreased
  casserole; cover. (Refrigerate leftover stuffing until 30 minutes
  before turkey is done. Bake covered until hot, bout 45 minutes.) Heat
  oven to 325 degrees F. Place turkey breast side up in roasting pan.
  Brush with Margarine. Insert meat thermometer in thigh muscle or
  breast, not touching the bone. (Tip of thermometer can be inserted in
  center of stuffing also) Do not add water and do not cover. Roast
  until done, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Place a tent of aluminum foil loosely
  over turkey when it begins to turn golden. After 2 1/2 hours, cut
  band or remove skewer holding legs. Turkey is done when the
  thermometer placed in the thigh muscle registers 185 degrees or
  drumstick meat feels very soft when pressed between fingers.
  (Thermometer inserted in the stuffing will register 165 degrees F.)
  Let stand about 20 minutes before carving.  As soon as possible after
  serving, remove every bet of stuffing from the turkey. Cool stuffing
  and turkey promptly; refrigerate separately, and use within 2 days.
  
  SOUTHWEST STUFFING: Cook and stir chayote, chiles (* Seed and finely
  chop chiles), garlic, and onion in margarine in 10-inch skillet until
  chayote is tender. Stir in cilantro, salt, thyme, and sage until well
  blended. Stir in about 1/3 of the cornbread cubes. Turn mixture into
  deep bowl. Add the remaining cornbread cubes and pecans. Toss and
  fill turkey.

      Title: TURKEY WITH WILD RICE STUFFING (OPTIONALLY SM
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      8 oz Wild rice -- rinsed and
           Drained
     10 oz Pork sausage, mild or hot --
           To taste
      2 tb Butter
      1 md Onion -- chopped
      8 oz Mushrooms -- sliced
    1/2 ts Rubbed sage
      1 c  Parsley -- chopped
           Salt and pepper -- to taste
     12 lb Whole turkey
      2 c  Apple wood chips or twigs
           (optional) -- soaked 1 hour
 
  Combine the rice with 3 cups of salted water, bring to a boil, reduce
  the heat, cover and simmer until the rice is al dente -- 25 to 35
  minutes. Wild rice varies considerably, so watch it carefully toward
  the end. You do not want the rice fully cooked -- only a few of the
  rice grains should have split. The rice will continue cooking in the
  bird.
  
  In a Dutch oven, crumble the suasage meat and brown it. Pour off any
  accumulated fat.  Add the butter and melt it. Add the onion and
  mushrooms. Cook, uncovered, until the onions are soft and the
  mushrooms have given up their liquid.  The mixture should not have
  any excess water. Remove from the heat.  Mix in the sage and parsley.
  Taste and adjust the seasoning ~- it probably will not not need any
  salt. Refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  Prepare your Weber Kettle or other barbecue for indirect heat, or
  preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Clean the turkey, removing as much
  loose interior fat as possible. Reserve the neck and giblets for
  another use. Salt and pepper the cavity.  Stuff the bird fairly full
  ~- the stuffing will swell up just a little. Truss the bird and roast
  until done -- 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  Remove the bird from the oven or
  barbecue and let it rest 10 minutes before carving. Combine any
  excess stuffing with the turkey neck in a baking dish and bake at 350
  degrees for 60 minutes.
  
  If cooked on the barbecue, smoking the bird adds a delicate smoke
  flavor to the meat.  Scatter the soaked apple wood on the coals
  several times during the first 1 1/2 hours of cooking. You will also
  have to add some charcoal every half hour or so to keep the fire
  going. Discard any drippings from the barbecue.
  
  If roasted in the oven, the drippings can be used to make gravy.

      Title: TURKEY~ MICROWAVED1
 Categories: Poultry, Microwave
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           -----INGREDIENTS-----
      1    12-14 defrosted turkey
      1    Large Oven Roasting Bag
           - (turkey size)
      1    Recipe Turkey Basting Agent
           (see index)
 
  TURKEY COOKED IN THE MICROWAVE REMAINS TASTY LONGER THEN OVEN
  
  First stuff the turkey with your favorite stuffing mix. Then paint the
  turkey with the prepared turkey basting agent (see index). Gently
  place the stuffed and painted bird in the flour dusted roasting bag
  and place into a glass microwave roasting pan.  Enter the weight of
  the turkey on your microwave computer.  For example, a 12 lb, 8 oz
  bird will cook in the microwave oven 115-121 minutes at 70% power.
  Standing time will be 57-60 minutes. Dividing the time into fourths,
  the bird will cook at 70% power for about 29 minutes on its breast
  side; turn the dish and cook another 29 minutes.  Now carefully turn
  the bird upside down (there will be a lot of juices in the bag, so be
  extra careful). With the bird breast side up, cook another
       29    minutes at 70% power.

 Categories: Poultry, Microwave
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           (No Ingredients)
 
  (Continued from part 1)
  
  Turn the roasting pan around again to cook for the remaining 29
  minutes at 70% power.
  
  Carefully remove bird from roasting bag, saving the juices for the
  gravy. Remove the stuffing at this point and place in a covered dish
  to keep warm. Cover the bird loosely with a tent of tin foil and
  leave alone for 1 hour to let the bird finish cooking. Carve and
  serve. Refrigerate any leftovers in a plastic sack or a Tupperware
  container. The meat will remain moist and juicy for several days.
  
  If your bird is smaller or larger than the example given and you do
  not have a meat microwave computer, adjust the times accordingly.
  This seems like a lot of work but it really is worth the effort.

      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      1    Pkg Fillo Sheets
      1 lb Butter, melted
      1 lb Walnuts, chopped
      3 c  Sugar, white granulated
    1/2 ts Ground Cloves
      1 ts Ground Cinnamon or
    1/4 ts Ground and 1 Stick Cinnamon
           9 x 13 Pyrex Baking Dish
           Pastry Brush
 
  1. Chop walnuts to medium fine and mix with 1 cup sugar, 1/4 Teaspoon
  ground Cinnamon and 1/4 Teaspoon ground Cloves. 2. Melt Butter. 3. Cut
  Fillo in half so that each sheet fits the bottom of the Baking Pan. 4.
  Generously butter the bottom and sides of the baking pan and place the
  Fillo, one sheet ata a time, in the baking pan. Generously spread
  butter on each sheet of fillo as it is placed in the pan. Every 6 to
  8 sheets of Fillo sp[read a layer of walnut mix.  Continue layering
  Fillo sheets and walnuts until Fillo is complete. Pour any remaining
  butter over top of the Baklava.  The secret to good flaky Baklava is
  to have each sheet of Fillo well buttered so that the sheets do not
  stick together. 5. With a sharp knife, cut the Baklava diagonally to
  form diamond shaped pieces. 6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake
  the Baklava for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown on top.
  Remove from oven and allow to cool completely. 7. SYRUP Mix one cup
  water, two cups sugar, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves and either 3/4
  teaspoons Cinnamon or the Cinnamon stick in a sauce pan and bring to
  a bnoil. Simmer for 20 minutes. 8. Pour the boiling syrup over the
  cool Baklava and allow to cool completely again. When cool serve

MMMMM--------------------POACHING FLAVOURINGS-------------------------
      2    Onions; sliced, unpeeled
      1    Bouquet garni
    1/2    Lemon (juice only)
           A few peppercorns
           Coriander seeds

MMMMM------------------------WALNUT SAUCE-----------------------------
      6 oz Walnut kernels
  1 1/2 oz Crustless bread
  1 1/2 ts Well-toasted corinader seeds
      1 bn Fresh coriander
      2 tb Walnut oil
      1 tb Paprika
 
  Put the bird into a pan, add the flavourings and enough hot (not
  boiling) water to cover the thighs. Poach for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours
  until tender. Let the bird cool in the pan, then skin and bone it.
  Wrap the flesh to keep it succulent.  Return the chicken skin and
  bones to the pan and simmer for 2 hours more. Strain and de-grease.
  Reduce to 3/4 pints and cool.
  
  Scald or lightly toast the nuts and rub off the papery thin skins.
  Then, using a spice or coffee mill, reduce the nuts and coriander
  seeds to a fine powder. Process in small batches, adding the bread to
  minumise stickiness. Transfer the aromatic powder to a bowl and
  gradually blend in as much of the stock as is needed to make a
  creamy-textured masking sauce ~ you probably won't need it at all.
  
  Cut the meat into small strips.  Put them into a pretty dish, adding
  some of the sauce and a little fresh chopped coriander between
  layers. Spoon the rest of the sauce over the top to cover the meat
  completely. Just before serving, stir ther walnut oil into the
  paprika. Drizzle the mixture over the dish in a decorative red
  pattern and place a little bouquet of fresh coriander in the centre.
  Serve with rice and a green salad.

 Categories: Soups, Oz
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    375 g  Black bean packet
      2 l  Water
        lg Pinch parsley
        lg Pinch thyme
        lg Pinch summer savory
      1 ts Butter,cold
           Salt & pepper to taste
      4 ea Hard boiled egg yolks,choppe
      1 ea Lemon,sliced
    1/2 ea Glass of wine*
           Few meatballs of forcemeat*
 
  Soak the black beans in water overnight. Boil them in 2 liters of
  water until they are soft. Puree the beans in a blender or push
  through a sieve, reserving liquid. Return the puree to the soup pot
  along with the liquid. Put the parsley,thyme,and summur savory into a
  small piece of muslin,tie and put into the pot. Add butter and season
  with salt and pepper. Simmer for at least 30 minutes. Just before
  serving,add the egg yolks,lemon slices,wine, and meatballs.
  
  Original authors note: "This soup is so near the flavor of real
  turtle soup that few people are able to tell the difference!"
  
  * Wine not specified. My guess is a dry white unless you like sweet
  turtles. * Forcemeat is sausage meat, ground, not overly spicey. I
  also presume that the meatballs are cooked somewhere along the way
  but it doesn't mention it in the recipe.

      Title: TUSCAN BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Italian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 oz Fresh yeast; -=OR=-
      2 pk -Instant dry yeast granules
  1 1/4 c  Warm water (125F)
  2 1/4 c  Unbleached white flour
    1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
 
  IN A LARGE BOWL, DISSOLVE the yeast in the water. Mix the 2 flours
  and stir them in to make a soft dough. Knead 10 minutes by hand, or 4
  minutes in a heavy duty mixer with a dough hook. Oil a clean bowl and
  set the dough in it, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise
  until doubled in bulk. (In the traditional warm place, this will take
  about 2 hours. However, a cooler temperature will do as long as the
  dough has enough time to rise, including overnight in the
  refrigerator.) If the dough is ready sooner than it is needed, punch
  it down and refrigerate it or let it rise slowly again at room
  temperature until ready to use. Rub 2 to 3 tablespoons flour into a
  lintless dish towel and set the towel on a baking sheet. When the
  dough has completed its rising, punch it down, turn it out onto a
  floured work surface, and flatten it into an oblong about 8 inches
  wide, 10 inches long, and 1/4-inch thick. It will still be very soft,
  but try to use a minimum of additional flour in handling it. Roll the
  dough tight, jelly-roll fashion, into a cylindrical shape. Flatten
  this to about 1-inch thick and roll it again. (This activates the web
  of gluten that will keep the loaf from flattening out in the oven.)
  FOR A ROUND LOAF, tuck both ends of the cylinder under to meet in the
  center, pinching to seal them. Roll the dough around the work surface
  under your hands, to shape it into a smooth ball about 5 inches in
  diameter. FOR AN OBLONG LOAF, roll the dough under your hands into a
  fat cigar shape, extending it to about 10 inches in length. Set the
  loaf on the floured towel and fold the ends of the towel loosely
  around it. Put the covered loaf, on its baking sheet, in a warm place
  to rise for 1 hour. Preheat an oven lined with baking tiles to 400F.
  Have a water-filled sprayer handy. Slide your hand under the towel,
  pick up the loaf, and gently deposit it upside down on the tiles.
  Spray water into the oven before closing the door, and spray twice
  more at 2-minute intervals. Bake for 50 minutes or until golden
  brown. The bread should have a hollow sound when you knock on its
  bottom. Makes 1 Loaf

      Title: TUSCAN TUNA & BEANS WHITE OR GREEN
 Categories: Entree
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
      1/2 md red onion -- chopped
        2 TB red wine vinegar
        3 c  cooked white kidney beans --
  :          or
  :          fresh green beans --
  :          steamed
      1/4 c  extra virgin olive oil
  :          salt and pepper
        8 oz tuna -- as noted
        1 TB chopped parsley
  
  This is a 'mother' recipe. It illustrates the Italian approach to
  preparing vegetables.  The dish features tuna, so the tuna's quality
  matters greatly. If canned, chose tuna packed in olive oil; if fresh
  tuna, grill or poach it, marinate in extra virgin. See further for
  detail.
  
  1. Marinate the onion with vinegar for 15 minutes. Drain the onion.
  
  2. Put the beans in a serving bowl. Mix with the onion, extra virgin
  olive oil, salt, and pepper.
  
  3. Drain the tuna, break it into flakes or chunks with a fork, and
  scatter it on top of the beans. Sprinkle with the parsley.
  
  Description and Detail: Preserved tuna, packed in extra virgin olive
  oil, is paired with white beans in Tuscany, a speedy dish to assemble
  if you've got beans on hand. Canned beans work well and simplify this
  preparation: open a few cans and chop an onion. Quality tuna makes a
  big difference in the success of this dish. Leftover grilled or
  poached tuna can be used instead of canned but it should be marinated
  in extra virgin olive oil. All choices will work better than water
  packed tuna. Scallions can be used in the spring, red onions for the
  rest of the year. Torquato, my farmer and muse, suggested combining
  green beans with tuna during his glorious green bean season, a
  fantastic idea. (Feniger) Recipe By : Milliken-Feniger: KCRW's Good

  Cover the TVP with boiling water and soak for 10 minutes. While it's
  soaking, saute chopped onion. Put the TVP into the pan, add the taco
  mix and enough water to dissolve the seasoning, but not enough to
  make it watery. Stir for awhile to mix the seasoning in, then add the
  beans/chile. Cook for no more than 15 minutes (or the TVP gets too
  mushy).

    1/2    To 1 t dried basil
        x  Pace medium picanti
 
  Soak about 1 cup of TVP in boiling water, to cover, with several tbsp
  taco seasoning, extra chili powder, and salt to taste...let it sit
  until the TVP has soaked up much of the water and flavor from the
  spices. Meanwhile, saute 1 chopped green pepper, 1 chopped med/large
  onion, and 1-2 cloves finely chopped garlic in wine or balsamic
  vinegar until the onion is translucent. Stir in one can of diced
  tomatoes (~16 oz), one or two cans of drained and *rinsed* kidney
  beans, one can of tomato sauce (8 oz), chili powder, and 1/2-1 tsp
  dried basil (or several chopped leaves if fresh). Drain excess liquid
  from the TVP (so there isn't a puddle of water...it can still be wet)
  and add to the rest. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 20
  minutes or more. To each bowl my SO and I like a big blob of Pace
  medium picante, but my 6 yo likes it plain with baked Tostito's.

 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Couscous prepared per
           Pk (1*1/2C*water to 1c
           Couscous)
    1/2 c  Cooking sherry
      1    Onion, chopped
      2 c  Chopped broccoli &/or
           Cauliflour
      1 ea Bell pepper, chopped
      1 ea Bunch green onions
      1 ea Bunch spinach
      1 ea Garlic to taste
      1 ea Herbs (rosemary, oregano,
           Bay leaves)
      1 sm Pinch cayenne pepper
      2 tb Whole wheat flour
 
  Place a large skillit over medium heat.  Pour about 1/2-3/4 c of
  cooking sherry in.  Chop up 1 onion and add. Stir occasionally. Add a
  couple cups of chopped broccolli and/or califlour. Continue to saute.
  Add a chopped bell pepper. Add a bunch of gree onions. Spinich, ,
  etc. can be added at this point.  Add as much garlic as you can
  stand. I usually use 3 or 4 cloves.  Add Rosemay, Oregano, Bay
  leaves, and small pinch of cayanne. Suate all of this until done.
  Usually just a few minutes.
  
  Add water to cous cous, stir well, and leave covered.

  as possible, and some of the vegetables. Add 2 cups of room
  temperature water to the remaining liquid. Mix two tablespoons of
  whole wheat flour in 1/2 cup of room temperature water until
  completely dissolved. Any lumps will prove disaterous. When the water
  in the skillit boils, and the water/whole wheat mixture.  Stir until
  the gravy thickens.
  
  To serve put cous cous on each plate, top with vegetable, and gray.
  From the beggining of preperation to serving has never taken me more
  than half an hour. Love, Luck and Lolipops Ralph

 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Head romaine lettuce
      1    Head iceberg lettuce
     10 oz Frozen peas, rinsed
           -until just thawed
      2 md Sweetish onions, chopped
      1    Green pepper, chopped
      1 c  Celery, chopped
  1 1/2 c  Mild cheddar cheese, grated
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
      1 c  Or 2 Hellmann's real
           -mayonnaise
      1 c  Or 2 sour cream
      2 tb Or 3 sugar
           More parmesan cheese
 
  Wash the lettuce.  Break into pieces, line the bottom of a [large]
  bowl. Add layers of peas, onion, green pepper, celery, cheddar, more
  lettuce, another layer of everything, top with lettuce. Sprinkle
  parmesan cheese over the top.
  
  Combine equal amounts of mayonnaise and sour cream, add sugar, mix
  well. Spread over the top of the salad. Sprinkle more parmesan on top.
  
  Cover and chill 12-24 hours.
  
  Some people say to toss before serving; this makes for soggy
  leftovers if you don't eat it all.  I suggest dishing out portions at
  a time and tossing the portion separately (keep the rest in layers
  with the dressing on top, it will be good for a couple of days).

      Title: TWICE STUFFED GOOSE
 Categories: Poultry, Stuffing
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Goose (or duck)
      3    Onions -- chopped
      2 pk Brown/wild rice
      1 c  Mushrooms -- chopped
    1/2 c  Green olives -- halved or
           Chopped
      1 cn Condensed Cream of Mushroom
           Soup
 
  1.  In a big sauce pan, prepare the rice (I use Uncle Ben's) just as
  the package dictates.
  
  2.  In a separate skillet, saute the mushrooms, onions, and olives
  with butter. Mix the rice and the sauted stuff together.
  
  3.  Stuff this mixture into the bird's cavity, packing in as much as
  you= can.
  
  4.  Place the bird in a pan or casserole that has tall sides, with
  just enough room for him to fit in. Pack the rest of your rice
  mixture around the bird, and on top. Bake at 190 =F8C for 1 hour,
  then turn it down to 160 =F8C= for 4 hours (depending on your
  elevation).
  
  5.  Remove the bird from the oven, and place him on a separate
  platter. Scoop out all the stuffing and mix it all together with the
  stuffing that was on and around the bird. Re-stuff the bird. With the
  stuffing that is left, mix it with the soup, UNDILUTED, straight from
  the can, and re-pack that around the bird as before. Return to the
  oven .TE (325) (160) for another hour.
  
  Author's Notes: I have, on occasion, managed to bring a bird or two
  home. A favorite recipe of mine originally called for a goose, but
  I've made it with duck as well.
  
  The bird and stuffing is very moist and quite delicious. I did not
  mention adding salt, because you should taste test to find out what
  is best for you. (I don't add any 'cause the flavor packet that comes
  with the rice is salty enough) I serve the bird separately (deboned)
  from the stuffing (with soup mix and without from inside the bird).
  
  Difficulty    : easy. Precision
  : approximate measurements.

      Title: TWICE-COOKED POTATOES
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12    Potatoes (do not peel)
      1 ea Garlic powder to taste
      1 ea Old Bay seasoning (or chili
           Powder) to taste
 
  Scrub the potatoes and cut in half lengthwise.  Put them in a big pot
  with water to cover and boil.  Cook until done (fork goes in easily),
  but not falling apart. Remove the potatoes carefully with a slotted
  spoon and set them on a cookie sheet or baking pan, cut side up.
  Sprinkle liberally with spices. Broil until browned and crusty on the
  surface. You could also bake for an hour or so if you don't have a
  broiler.
  
  I used the lower grade Idaho potatoes for this- they looked like
  perfect little Idahoes, but were only about 4" long (20 lbs for
  $1.99, how could I resist?). Russets would probably work well, too. I
  think Yukon Golds and other thin-skinned varieties would tend to fall
  apart. Seriously, using the right potatoes for any recipe can matter!
  Fanatical grin ;)

 Categories: Chinese, Beef
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Beef sirloin or flank steak

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      2 tb Dry sherry
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 sm Carrot
      1    Green bell pepper
      2    Ribs celery
      1 sm Onion

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 tb Rice vinegar
      1 tb Soy sauce
      2 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Chili oil
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
 
  Preparation: Trim and discard fat from beef. Cut beef across the
  grain into 1 1/2-inch matchstick pieces. Combine marinade ingredients
  in a medium-size bowl. Add beef; stir to coat. Set aside for 30
  minutes.
  
  Cut carrot, bell pepper, and celery into 1 1/2-inch matchstick pieces.
  Thinly slice onion.  Set vegetables aside separately.
  
  Combine sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
  
  Cooking: Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2
  inches. Place over high heat until oil reaches about 375 degrees F.
  Add beef, half at a time, and deep fry for 1 minute until browned,
  turning occasionally.  Lift out and drain on paper towels; set aside.
  Cook remaining beef.
  
  Remove all but 2 Tablespoons oil from wok.  Reheat oil over high heat
  until hot.  Add carrot and onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 1
  minute. Add bell pepper and celery; stir-fry for 1 more minute. Stir
  in sauce and beef. Cook and toss until well mixed.
  
  Tips: There should be just enough sauce to coat ingredients. It is
  easier to slice beef thinly if it is partially frozen.

 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------BRINE #1-------------------------------
      4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
           Plus your choice of
           Flavorings

MMMMM--------------------------BRINE #2-------------------------------
      4 c  Water
      1 c  Rock salt
      2 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Salt, regular or curing
           Plus your choice of
           Flavorings
 
  It is recommended that you rub in flavorings just before putting the
  fish into the smoker, although you can also put flavorings into
  either of the above brines; in other words you can prepare a brine
  marinade flavored with garlic, shallots, tarragon, dill, thyme, or
  whatever you fancy. After brining in the flavored brine, fish should
  washed off and dried before smoking.
  
  Smoked fish will keep for a solid year, at least if they are frozen in
  airtight plastic bags from which the air has been exhaled.

      2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Almond extract
      2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
     12 oz (2 3/4 cups) walnut pieces

MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
     12 oz White chocolate
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      6 oz Coarsely ground nuts
 
  * (Tobler(R), Lindt(R), or Nestles(R))
  
   The ultimate indulgence!
  
   Use the middle rack of the oven. Preheat oven to 425ø. Butter bottom
  and sides of two 13 x 9 x 2-inch aluminum pans, and dust lightly with
  flour.
  
   For brownies, melt chocolate, butter and coffee on top of a
  double-boiler. Blend until smooth.
  
   In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat eggs, salt, sugar and extracts
  until light in color and creamy. Add melted chocolate to creamed
  mixture, then mix in the flour and fold in walnut pieces.
  
   Pour batter evenly into pans. Reduce oven to 375ø and bake for 30
  minutes. Test for doneness with a toothpick (center will come out
  clean and dry). Remove from oven and refrigerate immediately to cool.
  
   To make icing: in the top of a double-boiler, add white chocolate,
  chopped in pieces, sugar and cream. Heat until smooth; sugar should
  be completely melted. Pour over cooled brownies. Sprinkle walnuts on
  top. Return to refrigerator for chocolate to set.
  
   Serve at room temperature, or freeze in trays, or serve individually
  by wrapping in saran wrap and foil.

      Title: TWO HOUR NUT ROLLS - QUICK POTICA
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 pk Yeast, cake or dry
    1/3 c  Milk, lukewarm
      6 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter or margerine, melted
      1    Eggs, beaten slightly
      1 c  Evaporated milk, warm
 
  Source: Treasured Slovenian & International Recipes
  
  *DIRECTIONS* Dissolve yeast in warm milk. Crumble in well so this
  mixture is smooth. Combine flour, sugar, salt. Add warm evaporated
  milk, melted butter and eggs. Now add the yeast mixture and mix well
  together. Then knead this dough until smooth and handles well. Divide
  dough into two parts. Roll out each part as thin as possible and
  spread with honey nut filling.
  
  We suggest that you prepare the filling before you make the dough, so
  as to have it ready to spread on immediately, as you do not need to
  have the dough rise before spreading on filling.
  
  *=FILLING=-= INGREDIENTS* 1 lb. nut meats, ground 1/2 cup butter or
  margerine, melted 1/2 cup evaporated milk, scalded 1/2 cup honey 1
  egg, well beaten 1 cup sugar 2 cups yellow raisins (Sultanas) 1 tsp.
  cinnamon
  
  *DIRECTIONS* Pour scalded milk over nuts. Add sugar, honey and melted
  butter. Mix well. When cool add beaten egg and cinnamon. Now spread
  this mixture over rolled dough, sprinkle on the raisins. Roll up as
  for jelly roll and set this aside in warm place to rise until double
  in size. Bake in 350 F oven for 35 - 40 minutes. Before baking brush
  over top with one egg beaten in with 1/2 cup milk, for golden crust.
  
  *VARIATIONS*
  
  Grandma uses pecans or English walnuts, and doesn't use raisins. When
  she roll out the dough she then places it on a smooth towel so that
  it will be easier to roll up the dough. Cover the potica while rising
  with same towel.

  Sylvia's comments: this was a desperation recipe I concocted this

  what can I pour on it FAST?") that came out absolutely delicious. The
  kids inhaled it and I've been nibbling in between refilling their
  plates. It's almost like the Hunter's Chicken I've been trying to
  duplicate. There was lots of sauce in the pot, which would be great
  to defat and serve over rice or macaroni.

      Title: TWO METHODS TO CURE OLIVES
 Categories: Can/cure
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           Olives
           Salt
 
  To salt cure ripe olives:  Use small unbruised black or purplish-black
  olives.  Cover bottom of clean slatted wooden box (such as a fruit
  lug or a flat rectangular basket with a double layer of cheesecloth.
  Rinse olives in cold water and put a layer on bottom of box. Cover
  damp olives with a layer of uniodized or pickling salt. (For each
  pound of olives, you'll need at least a pound of salt for the
  monthlong process.) Repeat layering olives and salt, then cover the
  entire batch with a final layer of salt and another piece of cloth.
  Set box into a tray or cardboard box so that the liquid that seeps
  out will not stain the countertop or floor; store in cool basement or
  garge and let stand one week. After a week, uncover and transfer
  olives and salt to another container. Re-layer olives with additional
  salt in the same cloth-lined box for about three to four days. Repeat
  layering and salting olives every four days for one month, using new
  salt each time, until olives are wrinkled and lose enough bitterness
  to be edible.  (If any mold appears on the olives, rinse mold off
  with cold water and soak olives in bowl of distilled white vinegar
  for one hour, then return to salt. Otherwise, there is no need to
  rinse the olives in water before returning them to the salt cure.) In
  batches, remove cured olives from salt; place them in a large
  strainer or a colander. Dip strainer or colander into saucepan of
  boiling water for a few seconds. Drain blanched olives and rinse with
  cold tap water. (Repeat this step with remaining olives, changing
  boiling water whenever it gets too salty-after about every 12th dip.)
  Spread olives out on paper towels to dry for a few hours or
  overnight.  Place olives in jars and cover with olive oil. If
  desired, mix in herbs, hot peppers, garlic, vinegar, or grated orange
  or lemon rind. Store sealed jars in the refrigerator.  The olives
  will keep for at least one month.  Dry-cured olives may also stored
  in new salt in airtight containers for up to six months in the
  refrigerator. Before using salt-stored olives, rinse and dry the
  fruits.
  
  To brine cure green or ripe olives:  Use mature fully colored green or
  dark-red to purplish-black olives. The ripe olives may fade in color
  during curing but they will darken again when exposed to air. With
  small knife, slash each olive to its pit three times. Rinse in water.
  Place rinsed and drained olives in one-quart glass jars, filling them
  3/4 full. Cover the olives with a brine containing 3/4 cup uniodized
  or pickling salt dissolved in a gallon of water. Insert a small,
  sealed food-storage bag filled with 1/4 cup water into each jar to
  keep olives immersed in brine. Screw on the lid loosely and
  refrigerate. After one week, replace the brine with a mixture of 1
  2/3 cups salt per gallon of water. After 15 days replace the brine
  with another mixture of 1 2/3 cups salt per gallon of water. Replace
  the brine at 1-month intervals for additional two to three months. If
  you keep the olives airtight in brine, you can store them for at
  least one year.  You can eat these olives within two months if you
  like fairly-bitter olives. Use them for cooking or season them for
  appetizers. To rduce their saltiness, soak the olives in fresh water
  three days. Store any uneaten desalted olives in the refrigerator in
  a solution of one part red or white wine vinegar to two parts water
  and float a layer of olive oil on top to preserve them.

  Next time you get overwrought thinking of squid or tofu, sit down to
  a nice steaming glass of the following and compose yerself...
  
  ARISTOCRATIC ICED TEA:
  
  It is the color of Chartreuse (which is also tinted with saffron). At
  least 4 hours prior to serving, pour boiling water over threads.
  
  Just before serving, add juice, sugar and ice cubes. Threads may be
  left in or strained out.
  
  Makes 40 servings.
  
  BLACK SPICED TEA:
  
  Chef Ashok Rajput of the Nataraja Restaurant (Palo Alto, Ca.) made
  this tea for me while demonstrating how to make Indian-style ice
  cream with cardamom, pistachios, and saffron. I thought I had found
  heaven between sipping the delicate, slightly sweet, aromatic tea and
  tasting the custard of the freshly made kulfi.
  
  This tea is called Qahwa in Kashmir where India's 4,000 acres of
  saffron fields are.  It is also served in the Arab nations and Iran.
  I have seen recipes with many other ingredients than the ones listed
  below, so experiment also with green tea, rose water, fresh ginger,
  almonds honey, cinnamon and milk.
  
  Bring first four ingredients to a boil, then simmer until liquid is
  reduced by half.  Bring to a second boil, add tea and steep to
  desired strength.

      2    Eggs
 
  Can't make up your mind how fancy to get? Here are 2 presentations of
  this tasty squash--one homey and one for "dress-up."
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Bring 1 quart water to a simmer. Cut squash in
  half horizontally and clean insides. Place cut-side down in a
  low-sided baking dish, fill with simmering water to about 1 inch.
  Bake 20 minutes. AS A TRADITIONAL VEGETABLE: Combine butter, spices
  and maple syrup. Turn squash over and fill with the butter mixture.
  Top with bacon slices, crossed. Return to oven and cook until the tip
  of a sharp knife easily pierces the flesh, about 30-40 minutes. Serve
  in shell. AS TIMBALES: Turn the squash over after the first 20
  minutes in the oven and add 1 tablespoon of butter to each half. Bake
  until they can easily be pierced with a sharp knife, about 30-40
  minutes. Carefully scoop out the flesh into a mixing bowl, reserving
  the shells. Beat in remaining ingredients and eggs. Place mixture
  into shells or timbales, and return to oven for 20-25 minutes or
  until set.

      Title: TWO-DAY CHILI
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Black beans, soaked starting
           In the early a.m.
      1 c  Brown rice (med. grain)
     28 oz Can diced tomatoes with
           Sauce
      2    To 3 med./lg. onions,
           Chopped
      3 lg Carrots, diced
      1    Garlic cloves to taste,
           Chopped
      1    Chili powder to taste
      1    Cumin to taste
 
  Cook brown rice and soaked beans in water to cover in crockpot set to
  high (overnight).  In the morning, add saute'd veggies, canned
  tomatoes and spices. Continue cooking on high (watch the water level)
  until dinner for flavors to blend.  Serve over
  rice/potatoes/tortillas, etc.
  
  I made some black bean chili last week (black beans, canned tomatoes,
  saute'd onions and carrots, spices) - from scratch - a crockpot full.
  And added a "secret ingredient" - brown rice, which I added when I
  started to cook the (presoaked) beans - overnight at high in the
  crockpot. All my SAD friends who ate it thought it was *great*, and
  that it contained m**t (actually, no added f*t, no added m**t - just
  what was in the rice, etc ;-)

           Tomato and onion sauce
           Tonato
 
  "Another interesting old delicacy is Txuri-Ta-Beltza which is Basque
  for black and white. Again it comes from the days when nothing could
  be allowed to go to waste, but, if made properly, it can be quite
  delicious and it can still be found on restaurant menus in the valley.
  
  "Txuri-Ta-Beltza is nmade from the large and small intestines of a
  lamb. Clean the small intestine, boil it and chop finely. Mix with
  garlic, an onion and a little parsley, all raw and finely chopped.
  This forcemeat is bound with 5 well beaten eggs. Then prepare the
  large intestine, clean it and turn it inside out like a glove. Fill
  with the stuffing, tie well and boil in water until it looks like a
  sausage and is thoroughly cooked.
  
  "The second part of the recipe involves boiling the animals blood.
  Once this is cooked put it in a casserole with a little oil, garlic
  and a small piece of fatty bacon. Saut 82 well and add a little
  tomato and onion sauce, prepared beforehand.
  
  "Allow the sausage to cool and then cut into thin slices and serve
  with the blood cooked with tomato."

      Title: TYPES OF GARLIC
 Categories: Info/tips, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  I buy garlic but never have paid much attention to the subtleties of
  it. Here's some interesting info on types and uses.
  
  HARDNECK GARLICS: These have a central flower stalk that hardens to a
  stem in the center of the garlic head. Tricky to grow and generally
  much less productive than "softneck" garlics, they are always more
  expensive.
  
  Examples include:
  
  ROCAMBOLE:  This is the most commonly planted specialty variety. The
  head is cone-shaped, with bright purple skin. The uniformly sized,
  wedge-shaped cloves are clustered radially around the central stalk.
  The cloves easily pop out of their papery skins. It has a strong
  flavor but is rarely bitter.
  
  SPANISH ROJA:  Similar to the Rocambole, but with a rounded head and
  skin coloration that ranges from red to mahogany. Grown most commonly
  in the Northwest.
  
  ITALIAN RED:  A generic name given to red-skinned, hardnecked garlics
  of several different varieties.
  
  SOFTNECK GARLICS: These do not have a central flower stalk. These are
  always used for braiding. These include:
  
  MEXICAN PINK:  A common variety grown in Mexico, it is characterized
  by cloves that splinter outwards from the main head, somewhat like
  leaves on an artichoke. The flavor is often quite hot.
  
  EARLY and LATE CALIFORNIA WHITE:  This is the main garlic variety
  grown commercially in California.  It is very productive and is well
  adapted to growing in hot weather. It has tight skins over both the
  cloves and the whole head, which help make this garlic one of the
  best keepers.
  
  ELEPHANT GARLIC:  A cross between garlic and onion. The flavor is
  mild and the texture is similar to an onion.
  
  OTHER USEFUL TERMINOLOGY:
  
  GREEN GARLIC.  Garlic harvested before the bulb has matured and before
  skins have formed around the cloves. It can be used like baby leeks.
  The flavor is mild but distinctly garlicky.
  
  FRESH GARLIC:  Juicy, mature garlic sold before the skins have set or
  dried.  This is perishable and susceptible to mold.
  
  CURED GARLIC:  Most garlic is cured for about a month to allow the
  skins to dry or set.

      Title: TYROPITA TRIFTI THRAKIS (THRACIAN STYLE CHEES
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Breads
      Yield: 100 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Light olive oil
    1/3 c  Milk plus;--->
      2 tb Milk
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
           -less, if cheese is salty
      1 c  Grated Greek cheeses
      2 c  All-purpose flour (or more)
 
  Delicious!  And simple to make in a large batch for appetizers. As
  made in Thrace, the soft-dough may be spread into a sheet and cut in
  squares before baking, or each shaped individually into daintly
  "bastounakia" (little canes or sticks).   The word "trifti"
  identifies the texture - crisp and crumbly in the mouth. (They are
  also called "kourou" [cut small].) If making the individual "little
  canes," they should be half a (dainty) finger wide and a finger in
  length. The secret of the crispness is in adding only enough flour to
  make a soft dough.
  
  To make about 100 1-inch squares:
  
  The mixing of the dough may be begun with an electric mixer, but
  should be finished by hand.  Beat the butter until fluffy, then lower
  the speed and add the olive oil. Continue beating, and when fluffy
  beat in the milk, baking powder, salt, if necessary, and cheese.
  Begin adding flour, but after 1 cup stop beating with the mixer and
  beat in the remaining flour by hand, adding only enough to make dough
  soft enough to roll into strips. Knead a few minutes.  Spread or roll
  on buttered sheet (jelly roll tray, cookie sheet, or any flat pan) to
  a thickness of half-finger's width and cut into squares of desired
  size (the smaller the better, since they are rich).  Bake in a
  moderate oven (350 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes, moving to the top
  shelf for the last minutes to achieve a golden chestnut color. (If
  making the "little canes," the baking time will be 10 to 12 minutes.)
  Remove when done and cook on a rack.
  
  Note: Stored in covered tins, these will keep for several weeks.

      Title: TYROPITES
 Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Ricotta or cream cheese
    1/2 lb Feta cheese; crumbled
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 tb All-purpose flour
      1 pn Salt (optional)
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg (or more)
      1 c  Butter; melted
      3 tb Butter; melted
      1 lb Commercial filo sheets
 
  In a bowl combine the cheeses, eggs, flour, salt (unless the feta is
  very salty) nutmeg, and 3 tablespoons butter. Cover the bowl and
  chill several hours or overnight, removing from the refrigerator an
  hour before using. Cut the filo into thirds (3 x 11 inches). Pile up
  the filo, covering it with waxed paper and a damp towel. Take out one
  sheet at a time and keep the rest covered.  Butter the filo, one
  sheet at a time, using a pastry brush and the 1 cup melted butter.
  Place 1 teaspoon of the filling 1 inch from the end nearest you. Fold
  the filo back over the filling so the bottom edge meets the left
  edge, forming a right angle. Continue folding back at right angles to
  make the triangular shape. Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees) for
  20 to 25 minutes or until golden and crisp, turning once. Serve hot.
  Note: Tyropites may be stacked upright in cardboard boxes and frozen.
  When ready to bake, separate while still frozen, spread on baking
  sheets, and bake as directed above, allowing an additional 10 minutes
  baking time. Diagram For Folding Tyropites Or Spanakopites __________

 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian, Pies
      Yield: 25 Pies
 
      8 oz Feta cheese
      2 oz Gruyere cheese or cottage
           Cheese (see note)
      2    Eggs (lightly beaten)
           -
      2 tb Fresh mint or dill, finely
           Chopped
      8    To 10 sheets of fillo pastry
      3 oz Melted butter
           Oil for greasing
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 F/ 180 C/ gas mark 4.
  
  To make the filling, drain the feta of its salty water and crumble
  into a bowl with a fork or fingers. Add the Gruyere/cottage cheese,
  eggs and dill/mint to the Feta and mix well.
  
  Cut the whole stack of fillo pastry into 3/4 long strips about 3
  inches wide. Brush each sheet with melted butter, place a (quite
  heaped) teaspoon of filling at one end (in the corner). Fold over
  diagonally to cover and keep folding into triangular pies - making
  sure that all sides have as many layers as possible to avoid
  spillage. Place the pies on an oiled baking sheet, brush the tops
  with butter and bake for 20 minutes or until crisp and light golden.
  
  Good when warm - can keep for a few days in an airtight container.
  
  You could also use more spinach instead of the herbs and decrease the
  amount of cheese used proportionally.
  
  (note: Here in the UK Feta is saltier than in Greece so this is why
  these ingredients are added)

      1 pk Frozen phillo dough
      4 oz Feta cheese
      1    Clove Garlic, minced
      1 tb Snipped fresh dill
           Butter flavored cooking
           Spray
 
  Follow the directions on the box for the pastry, ( defrosting,
  handling, baking time and temperature) Cut the slab of Spam in half.
  Cut those pieces diagonally so you have a triangular cross-section
  then slice the Spam into 1/4 inch thick triangles. In a small bowl,
  crumble the cheese, add the garlic and dill and mix well. Cut the
  dough into 3 to 4 inch wide strips. Follow the directions on the box,
  this dough is tricky to handle. You will use 2 strips for each
  pastry. Spray the butter-flavored oil between each layer. Place a
  triangle of Spam at the end of the doubled, sprayed strip and top
  with 1 teaspoon of the cheese mixture. Fold the filing into the
  dough, side to side, (like you learned to fold the American flag in
  Scouts) until you have a triangular pastry with several layers
  enclosing the Spam filling.  Spray (or brush) with butter. Bake until
  golden. (follow package
  
  directions)  These can be frozen before baking and cooked without
  defrosting a few at a time as you need them.

      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 x  Same As In 6
 
  Prepare the Sauce as in Tzatziki but only drain the yougurt for 6 to 7
  hours.  The mixture can be used in several ways. It is zesty on
  hamburger sandwiches. Top each burger with a slice of ripe tomato, a
  small heap of grated cabbage, and a dollop of Tzatziki sauce. It can
  also be served with grilled meats.  The meat juices mingling with the
  tzatziki are utterly delicious. As a sauce for tomatoes, it is
  something special. Cut several ripe tomatoes into sections, cutting
  from stem to stern, but do not cut all the way through. Open the
  tomato like a flower. Salt lightly and invert on paper towles to
  drain for a few minutes. Fill each tomato with some tzatziki and
  garnish with fresh mint.

      Title: TZIMMES & A GAHTZAH TZIMMES
 Categories: Beef, Jewish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Beef plate brisket
      2 lb Carrots
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 tb Brown sugar
           EINBREN or THICKENING:
      2 tb Flour
      2 tb Schmaltz (rendered chicken
           -fat) or shortening
      1 c  Carrot stock
 
  From "Love and Knishes".
  
  "Tzimmes" is a word impossible to translate. Ask anyone, "What is a
  tzimmes?" and you get the answer, "You don't know what a tzimmes is?"
  This is not very satisfactory as you can see.
  
  The closest I have come to an answer is that a tzimmes is a mishmash.
  Now a mishmash is a hodgepodge and a hodgepodge is...not a tzimmes,
  believe me...it's a big thing in anyone's life. A Gahntze Tsimmes is
  really somethig to boast about--a big production! For instance, from
  a good tzimmes, a cook is entitled to make a gahntze tzimmes. (Some
  people think of a tzimmes as a dessert). In my opinion is a one dish
  meal usually served as the fourth course in a six-course dinner. A
  Tzimmes can be made from almost any ingredient. From my wall-to-wall
  carpeting I could make a tzimmes, and from my new mink coat I am
  justified in making a gahntze tzimmes.
  
  Of course, there are some people who think not. You will find people
  who will begrudge you anything. They will say, "She's got a mink coat
  so she's making from it a gahntze tsimmes. I knew her when she only
  had a Persian lamb."
  
  From all these things you can make a tzimmes, but most tzimmeses are
  made from carrots.
  
  Carrot Tzimmes
  
  Simmer brisket in water to cover till almost tender (about 1 1/2
  hours). By this time the water will have boiled down to about half
  the original amount. Peel carrots and slice in half-inch rounds. Add
  carrots, salt and sugar to meat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
  simmer till carrots are very tender (about 45 minutes). Brown flour
  in a very small skillet, stirring constantly to prevent burning. When
  flour is very light brown, remove from burner. Add schmaltz and stir
  till smooth. Gradually stir in carrot stock to make a smooth paste.
  Add this paste to the carrots, stirring it carefully. Continue to
  simmer till stock has thickened (10 to 15 minutes.

  The combination of oxtail and watercress gives the soup a rather
  unconventional flavor and makes it a fine luncheon dish. It is
  reputed to be nourishing for nursing mothers. Watercress is
  specified, as substitute for the traditional green known as 'chaste
  leaf' or 'Indian wild pepper' (Vitex trifolia), kyaung- ban in
  Burmese.
  
  1.  Broil the oxtail in a gas or electric broiler until well roasted
  and slightly charred, about 15 minutes. Better still, barbecue over
  charcoal to impart a slightly smoked flavor.
  
  2.  Put everything except the watercress into a pan, and bring to a
  boil. Cover the pan and cook over moderately low heat for 1 hour or
  more to tenderize the meat until it comes away from the bone.
  
  3.  Add the watercress, cover the pan, and cook for 3 minutes more.
  
  Serve hot.

 Categories: Chile peppe, Chili, Texas cooki
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Beefsteak (round)
      1 tb Hot drippings
      2 tb Rice
      1 c  Boiling water
           Flour
           Salt
           Onion -- (optional)
      2 lg Dried red chile pods
 
  Soldiers of the U.S. Army on the Western frontier had been eating
  chili since the war with Mexico (1846) but not necessarily in their
  messes. The first Army publication to give a recipe for chili was
  published in 1896, The Manual For Army Cooks (War Department Document
  #18). By World War I, the Army had added garlic and beans; by World
  War II, tomatoes. This was a national pattern: Fannie Farmer did
  exactly the same (see the editions for 1914, 1930, and 1941)
  
  Chili con carne (1896) (per soldier). 1 beefsteak (round); 1 Tbs. hot
  drippings; 2 Tbs. rice; 1 cup boiling water; 2 large dried red chile
  pods; 1 cup boiling water; flour, salt, and onion (optional).
  
  Cut steak in small pieces. Put in frying pan with hot drippings, cup
  of hot water, and rice. Cover closely and cook slowly until tender.
  Remove seeds and parts of veins from chile pods. Cover with second
  cup of boiling water and let stand until cool. Then squeeze them in
  the hand until the water is thick and red. If not thick enough, add a
  little flour. Season with salt and a little onion, if desired. Pour
  sauce over meat-rice mixture and serve very hot.

  the meat. -- Cover loosely with a piece of foil and bake at 400 F for
  half an hour. Then lower the heat to 350F, and cook for a further
  20-25 minutes to the pound. Take off the foil for the final half

  large stock pot, place the water, smelts, onion, quartered carrot,
  leek, celery, parsnip, bouquet garni, and salt and pepper, and bring
  to a boil over high heat, periodically skimming off the foam as it
  rises to the top. Cover the pot, reduce the heat, and simmer for 35
  minutes. Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a clean pot,
  pressing the solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much
  liquid as possible. Discard the solids. Return the stock to the heat
  and add the salmon trimmings, wine, potatoes, and thin carrots. Bring
  to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the
  vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Strain the stock into a
  clean pot, discarding all the solids except the potatoes and all the
  carrots. Rinse the potatoes and carrots being careful not to mash
  them, and set aside. Return the stock to low heat and simmer for
  several minutes. Add the egg white and shell and increase the heat to
  medium high. Bring to a boil, beating constantly, with a wire whisk.
  When the stock boils, the egg white will start rising to the surface.
  At this point, turn off the heat and let stand for five minutes. Line
  a colander with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth and strain the
  stock into a clean pot. Add the fish fillets to the stock and poach
  over medium low heat until cooked through; five minutes. Taste and
  adjust the seasonings. Halve the reserved potatoes and cut into
  wedges.  Cut the carrots into fine dice. Divide the fish fillets
  among six soup bowls. Add a few potato wedges and diced carrots to
  each bowl.  Ladle the stock into the bowls, sprinkle with scallions,
  and garnish with lemon slices.

      Title: UKRAINIAN ALMOND CRESCENTS
 Categories: Desserts, Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  To 2 1/2 c unbleached white
           -flour
      1 pk Dry yeast (about 1 Tbs)
      1 c  Sweet butter, room temp
      2    Egg yolks, beaten
    3/4 c  Sour cream
           Filling:
      2 c  Almonds, toasted and
           -coarsley ground
    2/3 c  To 3/4 c brown sugar, firmly
           -packed
      2    Egg whites
      1 pn Of salt
 
  From "Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant." Yields 24 pastries
  
  Rogaliki, which means  "little horns," are a specialty of the southern
  Ukraine.  They are flaky pastries stuffed with sugar and nuts, and I
  warn you, they can be addictive. Although I am seldom interested in
  sweets, these are "devilish horns," tempting even me to eat just one
  more!
  
  Pastry:
  
  For the pastry, mix together the flour and yeast in a med bowl. Cut
  in the butter with a pastry fork until the mixture resembles coarse
  meal. Stir in the egg yolks and sour cream and mix well. The mixture
  will still be crumbly.  Form the dough into a ball using your hands,
  working it as little as possible.  The less you knead, the more
  tender the pastry will be. The dough will be tacky.  Wrap it in waxed
  paper and chill it for at least 2 hours.
  
  Prepare the filling by combining the ground almonds and sugar in a
  small bowl.  Beat together the egg whites and salt until stiff, but
  not dry, and carefully fold them into the nut mixture.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F.  When the dough is thoroughly chilled,
  divide it into three balls.  Using a floured rolling pin, roll out
  three circles about 1/8" thick. Work on a well-floured surface to
  prevent the dough from sticking.  Cut each circle into eight
  pie-shaped wedges and spread the wedges with the filling. Starting at
  the wide end, roll each wedge up like a little croissant and then
  pull the ends into a curve to form a "horn." Make sure the point is
  on the bottom so the "horns" will not open up while baking.
  
  Place the almond crescents on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake
  for about 30 - 40 min, until golden and puffed.

  too dry. Use water on your hands to knead the dough for 5-10 minutes.
  
  Cover and let rest for 2 hours at room temperature. It won't really
  rise much.  Again, use water on your hands and knead the dough
  briefly. Again cover, and let rise for 30 minutes more, covered with
  a damp cloth. Shape the dough into 1 or 2 long skinny loaves, again
  using water on your hands.
  
  Place the dough on a cookie sheet, either greased or dusted with
  flour. Proof the dough in a warm and humid place (85 deg F.) for
  about 45 minutes, until the dough is soft. There will be little rise.
  Bake at 450 deg. for 20 minutes, with a pan of water in the oven.
  Bake at 375 deg. F. for another 30 minutes, without the water.

  Make the raspberry coulis: In a medium saucepan, combine the frozen
  raspberries and sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly
  with a wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved and the
  berries are soft. Do not let the mixture boil. Strain the
  raspberrymixture through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl. Stir in the
  raspberry liqueur. Cover and refrigerate.
  
  Decorate the chocolate cake: Run a thin-bladed knife around the edge
  of the cake to loosen it from the sides of the springform pan. Remove
  the side of the springform pan. Invert the cake onto a serving plate.
  Peel off the paper. Refrigerate the cake while you prepare the
  whipped cream.
  
  In a chilled large bowl, using a handheld electric mixer set at medium
  speed, beat the cream with the sugar and vanilla just until stiff
  peaks begin to form.
  
  Using an offset metal cake spatula, spread a thin even layer of
  whipped cream over the top of the chocolate cake. Fill a pastry bag
  fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco #6) withthe remaining whipped
  cream. Completely cover the top of the cake with whipped cream
  rosettes.
  
  To serve, drizzle some of the raspberry coulis onto each dessert
  plate. With a sharp thin-bladed knife, slice the cake, wiping the
  blade clean between each slice. Place the slices on the dessert
  plates, and garnish with fresh raspberries if desired.

      Title: ULTIMATE SMOKED TURKEY
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1    Turkey; 8 to 10 pounds
      1 md Onion
      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 c  White wine
           Super smoking sauce; (see r
           -ecipe)
 
      Rinse turkey, pat dry and rub liberally with oil (we'd rub it with
  Liquid Smoke instead). Place onion, bay leaves and wine in water pan
  with hot water (we'd add a few sticks of celery and a few cloves of
  garlic). Place water pan in smoker and turkey on grid (it won't hurt
  to put a quartered onion, a few stalks of celery and a bay leaf
  inside the turkey; we also sometimes mix freshly ground black pepper,
  a bit of salt and some crushed thyme together and after loosening the
  breast skin with your hands, push this mix up under the skin and
  spread over the breast of the turkey). Place dome on smoker and do
  not remove until midway through cooking time. Then remove dome and
  liberally paint turkey with Super Smoking Sauce. Replace dome and
  continue smoking. When turkey is done, liberally paint again and
  allow to smoke for 15 minutes more. Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
  Charcoal:  Use 10 pounds charcoal, 5 quarts hot water, 3 wood sticks
  (we use about 5 to 8 presoaked wood blocks) and smoke 4 to 6 hours.
  Electric: Use 4 quarts hot water, 3 wood sticks and smoke 4 to 6
  hours. Add water to water pan after about 4 hours or as needed (you
  can tell when smoker needs water by the sizzling sound it will make).

      1 c  Flour -- all-purpose
      1 tb Old Bay Seasoning
    1/2 ts Garlic Powder

    1/2 ts Thyme -- dried
    1/2 ts Basil -- dried
    1/2 ts Oregano -- dried
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
  
  Coat a baking sheet with 3 sprays of the vegetable oil.
  
  Put the chicken in a large bowl with ice water.  Put the yogurt into a
  medium bowl. Set both bowls aside.
  
  * The secret to the success of this recipe is to make sure that both
  the chicken and the yogurt are very cold (hence, soaking the chicken
  in the ice water). The preliminary soaking will help the breading
  adhere and produce a crisp coating much like that of fried chicken.
  
  Toss all the breading ingredients into a large, tightly-sealing
  plastic bag. Seal and shake well to mix.
  
  Remove 2 pieces of chicken from the ice water.  Roll each piece in the
  yogurt.  Put the chicken into the plastic bag, reseal, and shake to
  coat thoroughly. Transfer the breaded chicken to the prepared baking
  sheet. Repeat the process until all 12 pieces are breaded. Spray the
  chicken lightly with the vegetable oil.
  
  Place the baking sheet on the bottom shelf of the oven and bake for 1
  hour, turning the pieces every 20 minutes to allow even browning.
  
  Serve hot or at room temperature.

      Title: UNADULTERATED BLACK BEAN SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 lb Dried black beans
      2    Ham hocks
      1 md Red onion
      1 md Yellow onion
      8 c  Water
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
      1 tb Dry sherry or Madiera (opt)
           Sour cream
           Chives
 
  This recipe is from Katherine Hall PAge's "The Body in the Cast" (St
  Martin's Press, 1993, $19.95). It's from heroine Faith Fairchild's
  cookbook, called "Have Faith in Your Kitchen." Faith notes that the
  soup tastes better if made a day ahead.
  
  Pick over beans, cover with cold water and bring to boil for 2
  minutes. Remove from heat and let stand at least 1 hour. (Or soak
  beans overnight, changing water several times.)
  
  Drain beans and place in a large pot. Rinse the ham hocks. Peel and
  quarter the onions. Bury hocks and onions in the beans. Add 7-8 cups
  water and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer 1 1/2 to 2
  hours. Be sure the beans are soft.
  
  Remove the hocks or bone and strip any meat from them. Add the meat
  to the soup and puree in batches in a blender. (Note: A food
  processor sometimes leaks with this much liquid.) Put the pureed soup
  in a clean pot; warm, adding the seasonings and wine, if using. Serve
  with a dollop of sour cream and finely minced chives.

  translucent. Add flour, stir and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic, soy

  Try eating this on hash-brown potatoes instead of toast or biscuits,
  it makes all the difference in the world.
  
  Use a coarse cheese grater to grate one medium potato per person. Fry
  'em up in a little butter. No salt needed because they're going to be

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
      2 c  Heavy or whipping cream
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
  1 1/3 lb High quality dark chocolate;
           -chopped
      2 ts Grand Marnier
           Coating (see note)
 
  For the ganache or creamy truffle center, slowly bring cream, sugar
  and butter to a boil in a heavy pan. Remove from heat. Add chopped
  chocolate and Grand Marnier, stirring slowly until chocolate melts.
  Refrigerate several hours until it is hard.
  
  For truffles, pinch off the size you want (about size of walnut) and
  roll into balls.  Do this quickly so that the heat of your hands
  doesn't melt the ganache.
  
  Roll balls in finely grated dark or milk chocolate, finely chopped
  nuts, confectioners' sugar, powdered cocoa or a chocolate coating
  (see note). Store at room temperature.
  
  Note: Truffle centers can be dipped in quality chocolate that has been
  tempered. (Tempered chocolate has been slowly heated and cooled so
  that the fat content has become stable enough not to melt at room
  temperature. This process is tricky, so Freddi Imel suggests using
  melted chocolate chips, coating chocolate or melting pistals
  available in baking sections or cake specialty stores).

      1 ts Salt

      1 lb Mozzarella, sliced
      1 lb Sausage, removed from the
           Casing and crumbled
      1 cn Whole tomatos, drained and
           Coarsely crushed
      2 c  Cloves, peeled and minced
      3 ts Dried oregano,OR
      5    Fresh basil leaves,
           Shredded
      4 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
           Cheese
 
  Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve the yeast
  with a fork. Add 1 cup of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt, and, and
  vegetable oil. Mix well with a spoon. Continue stirring in the rest
  of the flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes away from the
  sides of the bowl. Flour your hands and the work surface and kneed
  the ball of dough until it is no longer sticky.
  
  Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic wrap, for 45
  to 60 minutes in a warm place, until it is doubled in bulk. Punch it
  down and kneed it briefly. Press it into an oiled 15-inch deep dish
  pizza pan, until it comes 2 inches up the sides and is even on the
  bottom of the pan. Let the dough rise 15-20 minutes before filling.
  
  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
  
  While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Cook the crumbled
  sausage until it is no longer pink, drain it of it's excess fat.
  Drain and chop the tomatos.
  
  When the dough has finished its second rising, lay the cheese over the
  dough shell. Then distribute the sausage and garlic over the cheese.
  Top with the tomatos. Sprinkle on the seasonings and Parmesan cheese.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes at 500 degrees. Then lower the temperature to 400
  degrees and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up a section of the
  crust from time to time with a spatula to check on its color. The
  crust will be golden brown when done. Serve immediately.

  Mix two packets of yeast in 2 cups of tepid water and let sit for ten
  minutes.  Add 1/2 cup salad oil.   Add Olive oil, 3 cups flour;
  cornmeal and salt.  Knead for about ten minutes. Add 2-1/2 cups of
  additional flour. Knead this for 15 minutes.  Let dough rise to twice
  its size. Use blackened deep dish pizza pans. I'm not sure how you
  get 'em blackened - I cured mine with olive oil and then I just wipe
  them out when I'm done. They are kind of getting blackened looking
  with use. I have two pans and make two pizzas at a time. I spread the
  pan with olive oil and sprinkle with cornmeal. Divide the dough in
  half. Spread and cover the bottom of the pan. Spread it up the sides.
  I then let it rise again in the pan. Cover pizza dough with sliced
  mozzarella. Drain and squash a 28 ounce can of plum tomatoes for each
  pizza.  Drain off the excess fluid after squashing, and spread this
  over the cheese. Smidge of salt and ground pepper over the top.
  Chopped garlic, fresh chopped basil and oregano. Add the filling of
  your choice (I use sliced onion and Italian Sausage). Top with a
  Parmesan/Romano Cheese mix. Bake in preheated oven at 475 degrees for

 Categories: Bar-b-q, Main dish, Meats, Oriental
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 ea Large, Meaty Shortribs
    1/3 c  Oriental Toasted Sesame Oil
  4 1/2 tb Peanut Butter
      4 tb Brown Sugar
  2 1/4 tb Curry Powder
    3/4 c  Soy Sauce

    1/2 ea Fresh Ginger Root
      2 ea Large Garlic Cloves (minced)

  Make shortribs into short, flat strips.  Begin by placing rib
  fat-side-up on cutting board and cut 1/4" high layer almost (but not
  through) the bottom-most section of the rib. Turn meat over and
  continue to make 1/4" layers until the rib is completely layered and
  is now one long strip. Using the edge of a Chinese knife or otehr
  flat surface, pound meat until it is off an even thickness. NOTE:
  Chill the meat well. This cutting method will not work well on room
  temperature ribs. MARINADE: (Curry Based Blender Sauce) Blend all
  liquid ingredients in a blender for about 15 seconds at "Blend"
  speed. Grate the fresh ginger root and combine with the minced
  garlic. Mince the white (only) portion of the green onions. Add all
  ingredients to blender mixture and operate on "low" for about 45
  seconds. Rub suace onto butterflied ribs and refridgerate for 2 or
  more hours. NOTE: This sauce is excellent for chicken, too. Place
  ribs on grill, basting often with sauce until done, about 30 minutes
  depending on heat of grill. Watch carefully to determine when done.

      1    Green chilli cut into small
           Pieces
 
  1. Cook a vegetable mix with potatoes, peas, green chillies and lots
  of masala. Check for salt, before you stuff it in the pastry roll; no
  way to rectify it later. 2. Thaw the roll for about 10 minutes before
  unfolding. 3. After the pastry roll has thawed, open it out on a flat
  sheet and roll it with a pin to make it a little thinner. The pastry
  sheet would now be about 12'' x  12''. 4. Cut the sheet into 6
  pieces. 5. Place about 2-3 table spoons of the cooked vegetable and
  fold the sheet around it. Seal all the corners by pressing the sheets
  together and applying a little water. 6. Stick it into a pre-heated
  oven (350 F) for about 20-30 minutes or till it browns. Make sure
  that you flip it around every 5-10 minutes.

  to 350 degrees F. and bake 15 more minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cornish-style meat pies from the UP -- The pasty (PAH-stee) is a
  kind of English meat pie.  It was brought to the Upper Peninsula of
  Michigan by Cornish miners in the mid-nineteenth century. The UP
  version differs slightly from the original Cornish pasty in that it
  has more vegetables and less meat and crust.
  
  You can eat pasties hot, warm, or cold.  If you wrap them in aluminum
  foil when they come out of the oven, they'll keep warm for hours. Or,
  you can refrigerate/freeze them and reheat them later.  (Maybe the
  original "fast food?")
  
  *  Most people who live in the UP don't bother to make their own
  pasties; they buy them from bakeries and pasty shops (which are as
  common as hamburger joints are in other parts of the country). As a
  former resident, though, sometimes I get homesick and resort to
  making them myself. This is the recipe my mother sent me.
  
  *  These have a high cholesterol content.  I've tried using an
  ordinary vegetable-shortening pie crust, but it invariably turns out
  too dry and crumbly to hold together. (Authentic UP pasties have a
  crust that's thin, moist, and somewhat chewy, not a flaky crust.) If
  anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear about them. You can also cook
  the filling by itself in a casserole dish if you're feeling lazy
  about making the crust.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the crust ingredients.

  Place pecans or walnut halves round side down on bottom of foil in pie
  plate.  Sprinkle with brown sugar.
  
  Combine sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt and lemon juice in large bowl.
  Stir well.  Stir apples and dry mixture together and spread over nuts
  in pie plate.
  
  Roll pastry and place over top.  Fold edges under and flute. (This
  makes a rim to hold the juice when pie is turned upside down.) Turn
  up foil all around. Trim foil leaving 4" high. (This may be more
  important if you have a regular pie plate to keep filling from
  running over.)
  
  Cut slits in pastry.  Bake in 350 F oven about 55 minutes until
  apples are cooked.  Cover with large plate and invert so pie is
  upside down. Remove foil carefully. Serve warm.

    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  (1 stick) butter or

           -recipe
    1/2 c  Heavy cream, whipped
 
  FROM:      Family Circle, 9/72
  
  A deliciously different way to make a pear tart. Caramelized fresh
  pears bake under a flaky curst. When turned out, the handsome fruit
  design shows.
  
  Pare, halve and core pears.  Slice 7 or 8 halves crosswise and on an
  angle, each into 4 or 5 slices, keeping slices intact. Arrange as
  whole halves in a 9-inch deep pie plate, rounded side down ans stem
  ends towards center; trim one pear half to a round to fit center.
  Slice remaining pears into 1/2-inch slices, arrange on top to fill
  plate.
  
  Melt 1/2 cup of teh sugar over medium-high heat in a small heavy
  skillet; continue heating until sugar caramelized and turns
  golden-brown. Remove from heat; quickly stir in butter until almost
  melted, then pour over pears.
  
  Prepare piecrust mix, following label directions or make pastry from
  your favorite single-crust recipe. Roll out to a 10-inch round on a
  lightly floured pastry board; place on top of pears. Do not attach to
  edge.
  
  BAke in 425~ oven for 30 minutes or until crust is golden and pears
  are done. (Place a piece of foil under pie in case juices should
  bubble out.) Cool on wire rack about 30 minutes. Invert onto a
  serving platter with a rim. (Pie will have formed a syrup.) With a
  baster or spoon, remove syrup to a 1-cup measure. (You should then
  have about 1/4 cup, depending on the fruit.)
  
  Melt remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a small heavy saucepan. Heat very
  slowly until sugar melts into a colorless liquid, then turns
  golden-brown color and is caramelized. Stir in the reserved fruit
  syrup from the tart. Boil the syrup rapidly until it is reduced to
  about 1/2 cup. It will be slightly thickened.  Take care it does not
  scorch as you are boiling.
  
  Just before serving, spoon warm caramel sauce evenly over tart,
  reserving 1 Tbsp.  Spoon or pipe whipped cream onto center; drizzle
  reserved caramel sauce over.

  medium-low heat. Remove from heat and add wine. 6. After 20 minutes,
  baste turkey generously with butter and wine mixture and continue
  roasting according to wrapper directions. (If there are no directions
  with turkey, allow about 15 to 18 minutes per pound). Baste turkey
  generously with remaining wine mixture and pan juices every 30
  minutes or so, checking occasionally to make sure breast skin is not
  sticking to roasting rack.  Add additional 1/2 cup of stock if more

      Title: USING THE CHINESE CLEAVER (PART 1)
 Categories: Info/tips, Wok
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients
 
  With a little practice, any beginning wok cook can master the use of
  the Chinese cleaver. As mentioned earlier, a Chinese cleaver must be
  honed very sharply before use and one should have a suitable cutting
  board on hand.
  
  The Styles of cutting foods for Chinese cooking include slicing,
  dicing, shredding and mincing. It cannot be stressed enough that
  students must exercise safety in the use of the Chinese cleaver. A
  dull cleaver or knife will cause accidents as the cook will have to
  work too hard at slicing anything. A sharp knife will also cause
  accidents, if not held properly.
  
  To hold a cleaver properly for cutting, one should take his right
  hand (or left hand, if left handed) and get a firm comfortable grip
  on his cleaver. The other hand should be free to hold or move the
  food as it is being cut. If a food, such as a potato, is round, it is
  best to hold it firm on the cutting board and with your free hand cut
  the potato directly in half. Lay the flat side down on the cutting
  board and continue slicing. By creating a flat surface, a round food
  is prevented from rolling, thereby lessening the chances of an
  accident.
  
  There are two types of slicing styles in Chinese cooking. The first is
  straight slicing and the other is diagonal slicing. There should be a
  rhythm of motion involved in slicing foods and this may be achieved
  by the novice cook with practice. For slicing, insert the forward
  blade of the cleaver into the food. Your free hand should hold the
  food onto the cutting board. Press down toward the back part of the
  blade, slice. The motion should be forward to back. Use your free
  hand to push food up to the knife blade, keeping the fingers tucked
  in. The blade should be kept as close to the cutting board as
  possible. Repeat slicing motion until all food is cut. This slicing
  motion is done with ease. Great pressure need not be exerted on the
  knife. If you are using great pressure on your knife then you are
  cutting with unnecessary effort or else the knife is dull. Usually
  the novice cook does quite well until he gets to slicing the end
  piece of the food, then it is better to go slower to finish off the
  job.
  
  The main point that must be emphasized for wok cookery is that the
  food should be sliced as uniformly as possible. This is to allow like
  foods to be cooked at the same time. If some slices of a like food
  are thick while others are medium or thin, then the thin slices will
  be undercooked. So strive for uniformity in cutting.
  
  Meats, especially beef, should be sliced across the grain of the
  meat. This is to prevent the meat from becoming "tough" when it is
  cooked. The most difficult type of meat for novice cooks to cut is
  beef. It also is the easiest to overcook and render "tough." For
  anyone who has difficulty in learning to cut beef, it might be better
  to use a thin sharp blade knife (like the 1 1/2" cleaver). Lay the
  beef flat with the muscular or long fibers perpendicular to the
  cutting board. Insert the forward blade of the knife across the grain
  of the beef. Take your free hand and lay the fingers over the slice
  of beef that you wish to cut. Slice slowly towards yourself. You can
  feel the thickness of your beef slice. Try to slice your beef about
  2x1/2" in length and breadth, and about 1/8" to 1/4" thick. Some
  beginning wok cooks are afraid of holding the beef with their free
  fingers. This is incorrect as it will cause either accidents or
  result in coarsely, uneven cut beef. If you are initially afraid of
  the knife, do the cutting very slowly until you gain more confidence.
  The finished cooked dish will be the reward for your patience.

      Title: USING THE CHINESE CLEAVER (PART 2)
 Categories: Info/tips, Wok
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients
 
  Diagonal slicing is usually performed on cylindrical or
  semi-cylindrical vegetables such as celery, bok choy, beans, carrots,
  etc. It can also be performed on other vegetables or meats to give a
  more attractive effect to the finished cooked dish.
  
  Diagonal sliced vegetables have a larger cut surface area to be
  exposed for rapid cooking in the wok. By having this advantage,
  vegetables can be thoroughly cooked in a minimum of time and yet
  retain its bright natural colouration. Vegetables are also more
  nutritious cooked this way as a minimum of vitamins and minerals are
  lost in the cooking process.
  
  The only difference between diagonal cutting and straight cutting is
  that the knife is held in the hand so that it can cut the food at a
  45' angle. The same motion as in straight cutting is employed. Most
  beginning wok cooks do not hold their foods so that the knife can cut
  it at a 45' angle. They have a tendency to hold it as for straight
  cutting because they are afraid of the knife. Again it must be
  emphasized that one should practice this cutting technique slowly at
  first. Speed will come as one gains experience.
  
  Dicing food means that it must be cut into cubes of uniform size.
  Decide on what size you wish your cubes to be. If you are stir-frying
  food in a wok, the maximum suggested size that a cube should be is
  about 3/4". This is so that the cubes can be cooked through without
  prolonged heating.
  
  In dicing foods, it is best to cut strips or slices, depending upon
  the shape of the food, the desired width of the cube. Slice these
  strips or slices into square strips. Lastly cut these strips or
  slices into cubes.
  
  Shredded food means that it has been cut into the shape of sticks.
  Depending upon the food, one may shred it into very fine sticks or
  coarse sticks. If a food requires lengthy cooking time, it is well to
  shred it finely. The less cooking time required for the food, the
  coarser the sticks may be.
  
  In shredding foods, one first straight slices the food. Stack several
  of the slices on top of one another. Straight slight through the
  stack in the same width as the slice.
  
  Mincing foods is a requirement that all Chinese cooks must know since
  so many native Chinese dishes require mincing. Raw meat is perhaps
  the most difficult food to mince finely.
  
  Before mincing meat, remove and discard all tough connective tissues
  from it. Coarsely dice the meat into 3/4" cubes. Add cubes of onions
  or whatever that is to be minced with it. Take your 4" Chinese
  cleaver or your heavy duty Chinese mincing cleaver and chop the cubes
  with a straight rhythmic up and down motion. Use the blade of the
  cleaver from time to time to consolidate the mass of meat together as
  you are mincing it. When the meat forms a mass, it is minced. Examine
  it to see if it is as finely minced as desired. If not, continue
  chopping until it meets your requirements.
  
  There are some other practical uses for you Chinese cleaver. The
  blade of it can be used for transporting cut foods either into a
  plate or directly into the wok from the cutting board. The Chinese
  cleaver can be turned sideways so that the blade can act as a mallet
  for pounding meats flat or for crushing cloves of garlic or ginger.
  The handle of it can be used for grinding or pulverizing salted beans
  or peppercorns. Like the wok, the Chinese cleaver is a multi-use
  implement.

      Title: USLI GHEE (CLARIFIED BUTTER)
 Categories: Indian, Sauces and
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  Butter in India is called makkhan.  Clarified butter, instead of being
  called makkhan ghee, is called usli ghee (usli means "real" or "pure,"
  which in this context refers to the real or original fat of the
  ancient Indians).  Clarified butter or usli ghee is essentially
  French brown butter with the brown residue strained off. Usli ghee
  has a light caramel color and a heavenly aroma. Since there is no
  moisture present, it keeps well covered, at room temperature, for
  several months. (I keep it in the fridge .... I have no nerve.)
  
  To make 3/4 cup clarified butter (usli ghee), place 1/2 pound (2
  sticks) sweet, unsalted butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan (she
  means frying pan) and put on a burner. Keep the heat low until the
  butter melts completely, stirring often during the process. Increase
  the heat to medium-low and let the butter simmer until it stops
  crackling, thus inidicating that all the moisture has evaporated and
  the milk residue is beginning to fry. As soon as the solids turn
  brown (10-12 minutes), turn off the heat and take the pan off the
  stove. Let the residue settle to the bottom of the pan, then strain
  the clear butterfat (usli ghee) into another container. This usli
  ghee, when it is completely cool, will turn a cream color. Ready-made
  usli ghee is available in INdian grocery stores, but remember .....
  there is no guarantee of its freshness or purity

      6 tb Dry bread crumbs
      3 lb Pike; cleaned and scaled *
    1/2 c  Boiling water
 
     * Remove backbone but leave head and tail on fish. May substitute
       mackerel or sea bass. Cook the rice uncovered in 3 quarts
  boiling, salted water for about 12 minutes or until it is still
  slightly firm. Drain in a large colander and set aside to cool. In a
  small bowl, toss the chopped cucumber with 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Let
  it sit for at least 15 minutes, then drain and pat dry with paper
  towels. In a small saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and cook
  onions and cucumbers 6 to 8 minutes until soft and transparent but
  not brown. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and add chopped eggs,
  cooked rice, parsley and chives. Season with salt and pepper and
  moisten with a tablespoon of heavy cream, adding more if the stuffing
  seems too dry. Mix together lightly but thoroughly. Wash the fish
  inside and out under cold running water and dry thoroughly. Fill the
  fish with the cucumber-rice stuffing, close the opening with small
  skewers and crisscross kitchen string around the skewers as you would
  lace a turkey. Preheat oven to 350øF. In a baking dish or roasting
  pan attractive enough to bring to the table and large enough to hold
  the fish, melt 1/4 lb butter over moderate heat. When the foam
  subsides, place the fish in the baking dish, raise the heat and cook
  for about 5 minutes until it is golden brown. Carefully turn over the
  fish and brown the other side. Sprinkle top with half of the bread
  crumbs and then turn the fish over again and sprinkle the other side
  with the remaining bread crumbs. Pour 1/2 cup boiling water around
  the fish and bring it to a simmer on top of the stove. Bake uncovered
  in the middle of the oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until fish feels
  firm when pressed lightly with a finger. Serve directly from baking
  dish. Note: In Finland, 1 cup of finely chopped spinach, squeezed
  dry, is often substituted for the cucumber in the stuffing.

      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cracked pepper or coarsely
           Ground pepper
      2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
    2/3 c  Plus 1 Tablespoon V-8 juice
    1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce, such as
           Tabasco
 
  "The vegetable juice creates an inviting red color that forewarns of
  the snap in these spicy crackers, which comes from black pepper and
  hot pepper sauce. These are excellent party snacks. 325~F. 20 to 25
  minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  Stir together the flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl or in the
  food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse
  meal.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix the V-8 and the hot pepper sauce. Add the V-8
  mixture to the flour mixture and blend to form a dough that will hold
  together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or
  pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick. With a sharp knife,
  cut the dough into 2-inch squares and place them on an ungreased
  baking sheet. Prick each square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, turning over after 10 minutes. Cool on a
  rack. Yield: 70-75.
  
  VARIATIONS: You can substitute or combine tomato juice and other
  vegetable juices with the V-8.
  
  For more spice, increase the hot pepper sauce or add celery seed,
  cayenne, or your favorite herb.
  
  Substituting 2/3 cup of wheat or oat bran for the same amount of
  flour will increases the healthfulness of these crackers.

  Heat a skillet large enough to hold the scallops in one layer, and
  melt the rest of the butter.  Over moderately high heat, add the
  scallops and pepper to taste. Add the snow peas and stir-fry until
  the peas have change color and the scallops have turned opaque, about
  2 minutes. Don't overcook the scallops, just cook them until they've
  lost their translucent look.
  
  Add the sauce and lime juice to the skillet and stir everything for a
  few seconds, until well-mixed.  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sauteed scallops with snow peas in fish sauce -- This is something
  I invented with what I had around after I bought some scallops on
  impulse. It's inspired partly by a recipe of Madeline Kamman's and
  partly by Thai and Chinese recipes, although scallop recipes are rare
  in my Asian cookbooks. It's not spicy and probably has very little to
  do with real Thai cooking, but the taste of Nam Pla (Thai fish sauce)
  is an interesting complement to the scallops. Serve it with rice.
  
  *  Nam Pla is available in asian markets or some supermarkets.
  Substitute soy sauce if you cannot find it. Do not add salt; the Nam
  Pla is salty enough.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Experiment with the proportions.

      Title: VALENTINE COOKIES
 Categories: Biscuits
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceidebuurg
    3/4 c  Margarine or butter,
           -softened
    3/4 c  Honey
    1/4 ts Almond extract
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Finely chopped almonds
 
  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
  
  In a large bowl, beat margarine, honey and almond extract with an
  electric mixer until mixture is light and fluffy. Add flour, 1 cup at
  a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in almonds. On
  ungreased cookie sheets, shape 1/2-cup portions of dough into heart
  shapes, no more than 1/2-inch thick. Decorate as desired by following
  one of the tips below or by using a tooth-pick, fork or other kitchen
  tool to create a design. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until edges turn
  brown. Cool 5 minutes and remove from pan.
  
  Decorating tips:
  
  You can create a design on top of the cookies using white or colored
  candy sprinkles.
  
  Or you could crimp the edges of heart, making a design using the
  tines of fork, or a knife, spatula or spoon. Sprinkle baked cookies
  with powdered sugar.
  
  If you are an experienced baker, you may want to paint a design with a
  simple egg-yolk paint. Separate an egg; put the egg yolk in a small
  bowl and mix with 1/2 teaspoon water and enough red food coloring to
  make the desired sired shade of red. Using a clean paint brush, paint
  a design on cookie using the colored yolk. Or place a small doily on
  cookie and, using a clean, stiff brush, work the egg paint through
  the cutouts and create a lacy effect. Remember that this is all done
  before the cookies are baked.
  
  Makes 4 large cookies.

       Cut a heart pattern from a 4-1/2 inch square of paper. Cover

  are okay. Draw 6 hearts on the brown paper using your pattern as a
  guide.
  
       1. Beat egg whites with vanilla, cream of tartar and salt until
  frothy. Add sugar, a little at a time, and continue beating until
  stiff peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Rub a bit between your
  figures to feel that no sugar remains undissolved. Add food coloring,
  a few drops to make a delicate pink color.
       2. Spread meringue over the heart shapes, 1/4 inch thick. Make
  into the heart shape using a spoon to push and form into correct
  shape. Pipe rim 3/4 inch high with pastry tube.
       3. Bake in preheated 275-degree oven for 1 hour. Turn off oven
  and let meringues dry in oven for 1 more hour. DO NOT open oven door
  during this time.
       4. Fill the cooled meringues with scoops of ice cream and top
  with strawberries. Decorate with mint leaves if desired.

      Title: VANGI BATH
 Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Indian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 md Eggplant
           Coriander seeds
           Hing
      3    Dried red chilli
           Urad dal
           Turmeric
           Cinnamon sticks
           Basmati rice, cooked
           Coconut, flaked
      1 lg Lemon
 
  Cook the rice. The usual way - but to get it dry, fluffy and light
  (not at all sticky).
  
  Skin the eggplant and chop it into cubes; sprinkle lemon juice on the
  cubes (+ some salt) and let sit for
       30    minutes or so.
  
  In a large saucepan, heat some oil and when hot, toss the spices in
  and fry for 2-3 minutes. When the color has changed to dark, use a
  slotted spoon and toss the contents into a plate lined with a paper
  napkin (this will drain out the oil sticking to the spices).
  
  Add some oil to the pan and when hot, toss the coconut in and keep
  stirring until the coconut becomes brown/golden. Remove in a manner
  similar to the spices.
  
  To the pan, add some oil and when hot, add the soaked eggplant cubes
  and stir until about 3/4 cooked. Remove the eggplant and keep in a
  warm container.
  
  In a blender (or coffee grinder), blend the spices and coconut until
  you have a powder.
  
  In a pot, boil one-quarter cup water, lotsa lemon juice, 1/2 tsp
  turmeric and some salt.
  
  Into the cooked rice, toss the contents of the pot and stir. The rice
  should take on the color of the turmeric.
  
  Now, add the contents of the blender. The rice should take the color
  of the spice-mix and here and there, you can see a glimpse of the
  yellow turmeric color.
  
  Squeeze lemon onto the eggplant; let sit for 1-2 minutes; toss the
  eggplant into the rice and stir.
  
  Taste a bit; if you need salt, add. If you feel something is missing,
  squeeze some lemon, stir and repeat. (You may choose to add some salt
  that way too) Vangi bath is ready. Serve with yogurt raita/pachadi.

  VANILLA (Vanilla planifolia); is native to Central America and Mexica.
  Mexica monopolized the profitable Vanilla trade for three centuries.
  It is now produced mainly in the Malagasy Republic (Madagascar) and
  neighboring islands of Reunion and Comores. Lesser amounts come from
  Java, Tahiti, and Mexico. Long before Columbus discovered America,
  the Aztecs enjoyed a drink call "Xoco-Latl" made from cocoa and
  vanilla beans. This was discovered by Cortez, and Vanilla was taken
  back to Spain from where its use soon spread to other parts of
  Europe. Vanilla is the fruit of an orchid plant; each hand-pollinated
  flower becomes a long slender pod or bean which is picked while still
  green. It undergoes a curing and drying process during which aroma
  and flavor are developed. Pure Vanilla Extract, a delicate, subtle
  flavoring, is a complex mixture of natural ingredients, many of which
  are unknown. Imitation vanilla extract is a mixture of color and
  synthetic flavors, mainly vanillin. Pure vanilla has a pleasant
  "bouquet" and a full, well-rounded flavor that is not present in an
  imitation vanilla extract. For the protection of consumers, Federal
  standards have now been issued to define the name Vanilla Extract and
  provide that no imitation flavors may be used in making pure Vanilla
  Extract. USES...Use Vanilla to flavor most sweet foods such as
  eggnog, milk shakes, hot chocolate and other milk beverages; ice
  cream; rice, bread and other puddings; cakes; cookies; dessert or
  fruit sauces; custards; stewed fruits, fruit compotes; candies;
  glazes; frostings; whipped cream; pies; coffee; tortes; meringue
  shells; cheesecake; dessert souffles; sundae toppings; cream puff and
  pastry fillings; muffins; coffee cakes and cream cheese filling for
