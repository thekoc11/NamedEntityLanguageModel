     Title: Frances Cook's Bread & Rolls
Categories: Breads Londontowne    
  Servings: 24

    3/4 c  Milk                                1 ea Fresh cake yeast 
    1/4 c  Sugar                               3 T  Shortening 
      1 t  Salt                                1 ea Egg 
  3 1/2 c  Flour                             1/4 c  Lukewarm water 

  Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, & salt. Let it cool to
  lukewarm while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water. When
  soft, add the egg and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg mixture
  into the milk mixture and stir them together.
  
  The flour may be sifted or poured into the liquid. With a large spoon,
  stir until flour/milk is well mixed. You should have a firm, but not stiff
  dough. Without removing it from the bowl, cover the dough with a plate or
  towel and set aside to rise until double in bulk (about 2 hrs depending on
  the temperature in the kitchen). Instead of letting the dough rise at this
  point you may put it in the refrigerator and use it later, or the next
  day. Watch to make sure it doesn't spill out of the bowl. If it starts to
  spill before you're ready to use it, punch it back down. Refrigerated
  dough is easier to handle but takes longer to rise.
  
  BREAD:
  If you want to make bread, dump the dough out of the bowl onto a floured
  surface and with more flour as needed to keep it from sticking, knead it
  until springy and easy to handle. This dough does not require a lot of
  kneading; only enough to make it easy to handle. For 2 medium size loaves
  cut the dough in half and knead/shape each into loaves and put into
  greased baking pans. Allow about 2 hours for the dough to double again.
  Bake in a 375 degree oven until lightly browned on top (if uncertain
  whether or not bread is done, tip out of pan and see if bottom is browned
  too).
  
  ROLLS:
  To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily handled. Roll
  out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter and fold over and
  place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse rolls), or break dough into
  small pieces, make into little balls and place 3 in each section of a
  greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls).
  
  SWEET ROLLS:
  For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as for Parkerhouse
  rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a round. Spread it with
  raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Dot with butter and roll as
  for a jelly roll. Slice and place on a greased pan or make into a circle
  and make slashes through the dough at intervals. Let rise and bake as for
  loaves. Top with an icing made of confectioners' sugar, melted butter,
  milk, and vanilla or rum flavoring and drizzle over the bread or rolls
  while hot. Decorate with nuts or fruits.
  
  If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use half white and half whole
  wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of white. The amounts above will
  yield 1 large or 2 medium loaves of bread, or 2 dozen large rolls.

     Title: Whole Wheat Batter Bread
Categories: Breads Londontowne    
  Servings:  1

      8 c  Whole wheat flour                   4 T  Honey-molasses 
      3 T  Wheat germ                      3 1/2 c  Very warm water 
      3 T  Soya flour                          3 c  Corn oil 
      3 pk Yeast                               2 T  Salt 

  This recipe is for 2 loaves of bread. If one loaf is desired, use 2
  packages yeast instead of 3 and cut all other ingredients in half. Wheat
  germ and soya flour may be omitted.
  
  Put flour in oven to warm, at lowest heat. In a VERY large bowl, dissolve
  yeast in 3/4 cup of very warm water. Add honey to yeast. Coat loaf pans
  well with margarine and flour. Add oil, 2-1/2 cups warm water, and 2T salt
  yeast. Add about 4c flour mixture and beat at medium speed for 2 minutes.
  Gradually add more flour, beating well. Dough should be sticky - if runny,
  add more flour. Put in pans, smoothing top and making sure dough is pushed
  into corners. Cover with hot, wet towel and let rise in warm place. Check
  bread in about 20 minutes and keep checking to be sure dough doesn't rise
  over lip of pan. When dough has risen ALMOST to lip of pan, bake at 450
  degrees for about 40 mins. Remove from pan immediately and cool on rack.
