  2.  Place an aioli-filled artichoke in the middle of each plate, and
  arrange the cod, carpaccio, prepared vegetables, and eggs around it in a
  spoke-like fashion, making sure each plate has some of all. Sprinkle with
  parsley and capers.
  
  Makes 12 servings

  ======================================================================
  
  To make Aioli sauce
  
  Make sure the egg yolks and oils are at room  temperature. Peel the garlic
  cloves and if they are not very freshly gathered, remove the central shoot
  before crushing them. If they're quite old, reduce the number.
  
  1. Puree garlic in a food processor or blender. Whisk the egg yolks in a
  small bowl until light and smooth, and add to the garlic. Add salt and
  pepper to taste, lemon juice, and mustard, and process to a smooth paste.
  
  2.  With the machine still running, add the oil, very slowly, into the
  mixture in a constant, steady stream, blending constantly. Continue the
  blending until you obtain a thick, shiny, firm sauce. Transfer to a storage
  container, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to use.

      Title: Aligot
 Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Cheese/eggs, French
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 kg Potatoes
           Salt
     60 g  Butter
    250 ml Double cream;-=OR=- better
    250 ml Creme Fraiche
    360 g  Tome Fraiche; NB*
           Pepper
 
  NB. This dish is made with a cheese sold under the name of "Tome …
  Truffade", (another potato dish from the Auvergne). It is the curd from
  which Cantal cheese is made, a cooked hard cheese rather of the type of
  cheddar. Tome … Truffade is really quite soft, very mild and slightly
  rubbery in texture. It's not much good to eat on its own, but cooks up
  nicely in this and other similar dishes. I hope this description enables
  you to find an intelligent substitute locally. A grated VERY mild cheddar
  might do.
  
  "In contrast to cheese fondues which is cooked only until the cheese melts,
  the cheese and potato mixture for aligot should be beaten over the heat, so
  the cheese cooks to form long ribbons which are cut ('aligoter' in the
  local dialect) for serving. Dry gruyŠre or sharp cheddar can be used
  instead of cantal (Absolutely wrong- see my notes. IMH). AW"
  
  Cut the cheese, if soft, into small cubes, or grate if hard enough. Peel
  the potatoes and cut each into 2-3 even sized pieces. Put them into a pot,
  cover with cold water and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and simmer
  for 15-20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a
  knife or skewer. They should be quite soft (but not falling to bits IMH).
    Drain the potatoes thoroughly, and while still hot, push them through a
  sieve or vegetable mill, or a potato ricer. Put the puree in a heavy
  saucepan, add the butter amd beat with a wooden spoon over a low fire until
  the potatoes are light and fluffy. Without removing from the heat, beat in
  the cream and then the cheese and continue beating constantly with a wooden
  spoon until the aligot forms long ribbons when it falls from the spoon.
  Season to taste with pepper (and salt) and serve very hot.
  
  IH notes, I use this to accompany crisply fried sausages, or grilled bacon,
  where it is wonderful. With a mixed green salad, you have the basis for an
  excellent and simple french meal, very typical of the Auvergne. In the
  Auvergne, where this dish is cooked in great cauldrons to celebrate the
  return of the cows from their summer quarters in the hills, they would chop
  a lot of garlic very finely, and each guest would sprinkle as much or as
  little as they liked, over the aligot.

      Title: Asparagus and Blue Cheese Quiche
 Categories: Starters, Cheese/eggs, Tarts, French, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Pastry *
      1 oz Blue cheese (good)
  1 1/2 oz Cream cheese (Philadelphia)
    200 ml Made up to with half & half
      3 md Eggs
           Salt, pepper & cayenne
      8 oz Asparagus; peeled & cooked
 
  NB* As usual, the weight of pastry is the weight of flour used to make it.
  
    Roll out the pastry and line a 9" flan ring. Bake blind as usual at a
  high temperature (400 for 8-9 mins weighted down then a futher 2-3 mins
  just to colour lightly). Meanwhile, mash the cheeses together, put into a
  measuring jug and make up to volume with cream or cream and milk. Beat hard
  with the eggs (food processor). Season to taste with salt, pepper and
  cayenne as usual.
    The asparagus should have been peeled/trimmed as usual and boiled in
  strongly salted water until just tender - for really freshly picked
  asparagus <15 minutes will suffice. Immediately remove from water and
  separate on a paper towel to cool quickly. When cold, cut into 2" lengths
  and spread out on the flan base. Pour over the custard and bake in a
  moderate oven (375F) for around 30 minutes until nicely set. Serve warm
  (not cold or too hot).

      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Ham, smoked, diced
      4 ea Scallions, minced
      8 oz Cheese, cream, softened
    1/4 c  Cheese, Parmesan, grated
    1/2 c  Cheese, Ricotta
      2 lg Eggs
    1/2 ts Pepper, black
      2 ea Pasta, spinach, sheets
           -- ( 12 x 4 inches ea. )
    1/2 lb Prosciutto, sliced
           -- 1/4-inch thick
      1 ga Stock, chicken
           Chives, chopped
 
       ** Bouquet garni is a cheesecloth bag (or some other porous material)
  in which you've put some rosemary, thyme, bay leaf, and crushed
  peppercorns.  There is no rule for how much of each you'd use.
  
  Tomato Sauce: =============
  
       To prepare the tomatoes, drop them briefly into boiling water, then
  remove and plunge them into cold water and peel.
  
       Remove the seeds and chop the tomatoes.
  
       Melt butter in a saute pan and add minced shallots.  Saute, covered,
  for 5 minutes over low heat.  Add tomatoes and bouquet garni. Season to
  taste.  Cook covered over medium heat for 30 minutes.
  
       Remove shallots and bouquet garni, then puree.  Reserve sauce.
  
  Pasta Roll: ===========
  
       In a saute pan, melt the butter and add the diced ham and scallions.
  Cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes until scallions are soft.
  
       Beat the cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, Ricotta cheese, and pepper
  together until smooth.
  
       Add the sauteed ham and scallions to the cheese mixture; then add
  eggs, and mix well.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 - 3 hours.
  
       Spread half of the filling on one of the pasta sheets - leaving a
  half-inch border around the edges.  Brush the border with a little melted
  butter.
  
       Place a layer of sliced Prosciutto to cover the filling mixture then
  beginning at one of the short ends of the pasta, roll it up.  Do not roll
  too loosely or the poaching liquid may seep into the cheese/meat mixture.
  
       Wrap roll in a double thickness of cheesecloth and tie each end
  securely with string.
  
       Repeat for second pasta sheet.
  
       Fill a large saute pan with chicken stock.  Bring the stock to a boil
  and add pasta rolls.  Reduce the heat to simmer and cook gently, turning
  occasionally, for 25 minutes.
  
       Drain and cool before removing string and cheesecloth.  Cut each roll
  in half-inch thick slices.  Pour some of the tomato sauce into a pool on
  the bottom of individual serving plates and arrange the slices on the
  plates.
  
       Garnish with chopped chives.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

      Title: Cheesefilled phyllo pastry (cigarro burek)
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Appetizers
      Yield: 40 Servings
 
      6 oz Feta cheese, crumbled
      4 oz Creamed cheese
      1    Egg, beaten
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      1 tb Chopped fresh dill, or 1 tsp
           -dried
      8    Sheets packaged phyllo dough
    1/2 c  Butter
 
  Throughout the Middle East, bureks are made by folding buttered,
  cheese-filled phyllo dough into little triangular shapes. Cigarro bureks
  taste the same but, as the name implies, are rolled into cylindrical shapes
  resembling small cigars.  Bureks, frozen unbaked, can go directly from the
  freezer into a preheated 375 F oven to make an instant hors d'oeuvre.
  
  Makes 40
  
  Defrost the phyllo dough and return the remainder to the freezer. Butter a
  cookie sheet.  Melt the butter and remove from the heat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F.
  
  Mix the feta and cream cheese with the egg and herbs and set aside.
  
  Layout one sheet of phyllo dough on a counter.  (Keep the remaining dough
  covered with a slightly damp towel to prevent its drying out.) Brush the
  sheet of dough with some melted butter. Cut it the short way into 5 strips,
  about 3x10 inches each.  Place 1 1/2 teaspoons of the filling at one end of
  each strip.  Roll the strips into cylinders about 1/2 inch in diameter.
  Continue until all of the dough has been cut, filled, and rolled.
  
  Arrange 2 to 3 cylinder per person on the cookie sheet and brush them with
  more butter.  (Freeze the rest of the cylinders, unbaked, for use at
  another time.) Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the cylinders are well
  browned and very flaky.

      Title: Cold Lemon Souffl‚
 Categories: Dessert, Fruits, British, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Eggs
      6 oz Castor sugar
      1    Lemons; grated zest
      5    Sheets gelatine;-=OR=-
    1/2 oz Gelatine; sponged in
      2    Lemons; juice
      1 pn Salt
      1 pn Cream of tartar

--------------------------------TO DECORATE--------------------------------
           Lemon slices
 
  If using leaf gelatine, place them, one by one in a large shallow dish of
  cold water. Allow to soften, then drain and place in small bowl with the
  lemon juice and continue as if using powdered gelatine that has been
  sponged.
   For powdered gelatine, put juice of the lemons in a small bowl, stir well
  and then sprinkle the gelatine over slowly enough to avoid forming a "knot"
  of powder. When "sponged", ie when the gelatine has absorbed the liquid and
  become a mass, place the bowl (or jug) in a pan of boiling water, and heat
  until the gelatine dissolves, when it can be added to the lemon
  rind/sugar/egg mixture before cooking.
    While the gelatine is sponging/softening, prepare the mousse base.
  Separate the eggs, placing whites in a large completely grease free bowl.
  Place yolks in the top half of a double saucepan or a basin capabale of
  being heated (best is a zabaglione pan). Add to the yolks, the grated zest
  of half the lemons (no need to use the rest) and add the castor sugar
  little by little while beating. When really thick, add the gelatine/lemon
  solution, and heat over simmering water. Do not stop beating for a moment,
  and make sure you reach all over the bottom of the bowl. When the mixture
  thickens again and becomes very light and mousse like, remove the bowl from
  the heat, put into cold water and cool, beating from time to time.
    While the mousse mixture is cooling, add the salt and tartar to the egg
  whites, and beat to the soft peak. Cut and fold the cool mousse mixture
  (don't let it set, of course) into the beaten egg white. Mix well, without
  being so vigorous that you lose the lightness of the mixture, and pour into
  a large serving bowl, or individual bowls. Level off gently and let set 4
  hours minimum before serving. Don't keep too long, or the mousse can become
  very rubbery.
    Decorate just before serving with slices of lemon.
    This recipe can be made with limes, but adjust the number depending on
  their size.

  It's one of the few foods that naturally contains vitamin D and numerous
  minerals. On the other hand, eggs are not high in sodium or calories.
  
  BUT WHAT ABOUT CHOLESTEROL?
    Nutrition experts say the two main influences on blood cholesterol levels
  are heredity and saturated fat, not cholesterol consumption per se.
  Contrary to long-held belief, dietary cholesterol is not strongly
  correlated with risk of coronary artery disease. The problem is that some
  people are genetically cholesterol sensitive (their blood cholesterol
  levels do rise when their dietary intake of cholesterol increased) and
  therefore need to watch their intake of foods high in cholesterol. And eggs
  are high on that list: Although the whites are both fat and
  cholesterol-free, the yolk of one large egg has 213 milligrams of
  cholesterol and five grams of fat, 1.6 of them saturated fat. Although as a
  general rule the American Heart Association recommends a limit of four
  yolks per week, some diet and heart disease experts assert that dietary
  advice should be more individualized.
  
  WHAT DO THE GRADES MEAN?
    In descending order the grades are AA, A and B. The nutrition is the same
  no matter what the grade. Packers determine grade only by the quality of
  the exterior (cleanliness, soundness, texture, strength and shape) and
  interior (shape and firmness of yolk; proportion of thick white to thin
  white). Eggs that don't meet USDA or state standards for grade B or better
  never even make it to the market as shell eggs; in fact, most grade B's are
  processed into dried or other egg products.
  
  WHAT CAUSES BLOOD SPOTS?
    A spot forms when a blood vessel on the yolk ruptures during the egg's
  formation. It actually indicates a fresh egg, since as the egg ages, water
  moves from the albumen (white) into the yolk, diluting the blood spot. It
  is not a sign that the egg is fertile.
  
  CAN EGGS BE FROZEN?
    Not in their shells. To freeze whole eggs, beat them just enough to blend
  the yolks and whites, then transfer them to freezer containers.
  
  IS IT SAFE TO EAT RAW EGGS?
    As with all raw food from animals, there's a small possibility of
  bacterial (usually salmonella) food poisoning. Infection is more serious
  for those who are very young, pregnant, elderly, or have an impaired immune
  system. The American Egg Board says: Keep eggs cold. Cook them until the
  whites are set,, yolks start to thicken, and no visible liquid remains.
  
  WHY ARE SOME HARD-COOKED EGG YOLKS RINGED WITH GREEN?
    A harmless iron and sulfur compound forms when eggs are over cooked or
  not cooled quickly.
  
  WHICH CAME FIRST, THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG?
    The Bible claims fowl. Modern scientists hedge by saying neither. Both
  are alternating stages in life's never ending progression.

 Categories: Microwave, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 ea Egg yolks
      2 ts Lemon juice
      2 tb Water
 
  Place yolks in 2 cup measure. Beat until well blended.
  
  Add lemon juice. Beat again. (or vinegar)
  
  Add water. Beat well.
  
  Cover bowl or cup with saran (or a plate) and heat in micro until the
  surface of the egg yolk begins to heave. Count 8 or 10 seconds, remove the
  cup (bowl) and beat vigorously with a clean whisk until smooth. Discard
  whisk, quickly return to micro and heat again until it starts to heave.
  Count 8 to 10 seconds again, remove and beat with clean whisk until smooth.
  
  For standard Hollandaise recipe making about 2/3 to 1 cup of sauce you need
  3 yolks instead of the standard 2. I counted 6 seconds in my MW (700W) for
  2 yolks...8 seems ok for 3. Increase lemon juice to three tsp and water to
  three tbsp.
  
  Harold McGee's (author of "On Food and Cooking") method of pasteurizing
  eggs prior to using them in dressings where raw eggs are required. I use
  this method regularly when making Hollandaise or a Caesar salad dressing.

  vigorously with a wire whisk and then beat in the milk. In a small bowl,
  combine the egg yolk and cream. Whisk in 1 cup of the hot soup, 2
  tablespoons at a time. Now reverse the process and slowly whisk the warmed
  egg yolk and cream mixture back into the soup. Add the reserved vegetables
  to the soup and bring to a simmer. As soon as it comes almost to a boil,
  reduce the heat, add the cooked shrimp and simmer uncovered over low heat
  for 3 to 5 minutes or until the shrimp and vegetables are heated through.
  Taste and season the soup with white pepper as well as additional salt if
  necessary. Pour into a soup tureen and sprinkle with finely chopped parsley
  or dill.

      Title: Lipt¢ Cheese Spread (Liptauer)
 Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs, Hungarian, Dairy
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Lipt¢ Sheep's milk cheese
    1/4 lb Lightly salted butter
      1 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Prepared mustard
    1/2 ts Caraway seeds; pounded
      1 sm Onion; grated
    1/2 ts Anchovy paste
 
  Notes. "The cheese which is the base of this spread originally came from a
  north Hungarian area called Lipt¢. The Austrians who make a similar mixture
  call the spread itself Liptauer or, more correctly Liptauer garniert. Since
  in Hungary, Lipt¢ is only the name of the cheese itself, this causes
  unneccesary mixups in non-Hungarian recipes. If you are unable to buy the
  real sheep's milk cheese a very similar product called Brindza which comes
  from Romania, can generally be purchased in the better cheese stores (Feta?
  IMH)
    The basic MUSTS are the sheep's milk cheese, paprika, onion and caraway
  seeds. All the other ingredients are optional. In my home town I would not
  eat this cheese spread at my friend's house, because her mother also put
  capers and sardines in the mixture.
    In aristocratic houses and at the National Casino the spread was served
  topped with Beluga Caviar, which makes a very good combination,
  particularly if you get tired of eating caviar in the traditional way (!!!!
  IMH).
    Trieste, on the Adriatic was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until
  the treaty of Trianon in 1920, but even then it had a strong Italian food
  influence. The same cheese spread was made in Trieste with Gorgonzola
  cheese substituting for the sheep's milk cheese and Mascarpone, a fresh
  cream cheese, substituting for the butter. (We can buy a mixture of slices
  of these last two as "Magor" in France IMH). G.L"
  
    1. Sieve the cheese and mix it with softened butter and all the other
  ingredients until the spread is light red in colour and evenly mixed.
  Refrigerate.
    2. Serve with wedges of good crusty bread or toast, accompanied by young
  radishes, green peppers or scallions.

  they're similar to the yellow limes you can find in  Mexican markets. You
  can use the regular limes, but the pie won't have the tartness it's
  supposed to.

      Title: Melange Catering's Raspberry Cheese Torte
 Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
---------------------------AMERICAN MEASUREMENTS---------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Cheddar cheese; grated
    1/4 c  Finely minced onion
    3/4 c  Chopped pecans
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/3 c  (To 1/2) mayonnaise
    1/4 ts (To 1/2) hot red pepper sauc
      1 c  Raspberry preserves
           Assorted unflavored crackers

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
           Fresh raspberries OR
           Lemon "rose"
 
  This is a specialty of Linda West's Melange Catering and one of the
  Chronicle's most requested recipes. The recipe was developed with Hellman's
  brand mayonnaise.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Place grated cheese in a large bowl and let stand at room
  temperature until soft and slightly oily. Stir in onion, pecans, cayenne,
  mayonnaise and pepper sauce. Knead with hands until well blended.
  
  Line a 10-inch pan with plastic wrap. An indented flan pan is best, but any
  pan that will unmold to form a flat surface on top may be used.
  
  Press cheese mixture firmly into pan. Cover top with additional plastic
  wrap and press mixture again to mold firmly. Refrigerate at least 4 hours,
  or until cheese is firm again.
  
  To serve, unmold torte onto serving dish. Spread top with preserves and
  garnish with fresh raspberries or a lemon rose. Serve with assorted
  crackers (best if unflavored style).
  
  The torte can be made ahead, but preserves should not be spread on top more
  than 1 hour before serving. Makes 15 to 20 appetizer portions.

      Title: Potatoes Bogota-Style (Papas Chorreadas)
 Categories: Vegetables, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
---------------------------AMERICAN MEASUREMENTS---------------------------
      8 lg Baking potatoes; peeled,
           -quartered
      3 tb Butter
      2 c  Finely chopped onion
      3 ea Tomatoes; peeled, seeded,
           -coarsely chopped
      2 ea To 3) habanera chilies;
           -seeded and minced
    2/3 c  Whipping cream
  1 1/4 c  Grated Muenster cheese
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
  This well-seasoned dish is a specialty of Bogota, Colombia's capital in the
  highlands. Because it is uncommonly rich, it is an excellent foil for
  un-sauced or grilled red meats. However, it is outstanding enough to be
  served as a separate course, as it frequently is in Colombia.
  
  DIRECTIONS: boil the potatoes in lightly salted water until they are just
  tender. Drain and keep warm.
  
  While the potatoes cook, melt the butter and saute the onion until it is
  soft. Add the tomatoes and the chilies and continue to cook over medium
  heat for 5 minutes. Stir in the cream and the cheese and remove the pan
  from the heat as soon as the cheese begins to melt. Spoon the sauce over
  the hot potatoes and serve at once.

 Categories: Starters, Offal, Cheese/eggs, Hungarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Calf's brains
      1 md Onion; minced
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Paprika
      3    Eggs
      1 ts Salt; approx
 
  Soak brains in cold water, and peel off membrane. Drop brains into boiling
  water for 1 minute, then remove. Dry brains and scrape with a knife,
  reducing them to a rough pulp.
    Cook onion in butter over low heat for about 10 minutes. Add pepper,
  paprika, and brains to the onion and continue to cook, covered, over very
  low heat for about 10 minutes.
    Beat eggs as for scrambling. Just before serving, mix in with the brains,
  making a soft scrambled egg out of the mixture. Be sure to mix brains and
  eggs thoroughly. The texture should be almost like a creamy risotto, not
  like HARD scrambled eggs. Add salt to taste.
    NB this is a traditional appetizer in Hungary, sometimes served on a
  slice of toast.

    100 g  Heavy cream
    100 g  Roquefort
      5    Egg yolk
     10    Egg white
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Name: "Roquefort Souffles"
  
  To prepare the bechamel sauce, put butter in a 1 quart saucepan on low
  heat, when melt, add flour and cook 1 min to a white roux, add milk
  whisking constantly, season to taste with a drop of pepper and a pinch of
  nutmeg, cook over low heat for 15 minutes, stirring from time to time. The
  obtained sauce should be slightly thick. Reserve. Break the Roquefort in
  coarse crumbs; pour cream in a large saucepan, reduce to half on high heat;
  add bechamel, whisking vigourously, to obtain a smooth sauce; season to
  taste with salt and pepper, add the roquefort and continue to whisk until
  melted; remove from heat, add egg yolks one by one, stirring well. Beat egg
  whites to a stiff peak, incorporate in the roquefort batter, using a wooden
  spatula. Butter generously six individual souffle moulds. Pour the batter
  in moulds evenly. Sprinkle with roquefort crumbs (optional). Bake in a
  pre-heated oven at 230C/445F for 15 minutes. Serve immediately.
  
  Original comments: 1) This recipe is delicious, not so hardly done,
  souffles puff up very well, but you have NOT to use moulds greater than
  ramequins for THE perfect result; use two moulds per guest if needed... 2)
  Beware to salt! Roquefort is already somewhat salted... And, it is perhaps
  not so a good dish for cholesterol-impaired! ;-) 3) Last detail, as for all
  souffles, fold in the whites DELICATELY, stirring the batter up, or else,
  with all the lost of air bubbles, they won't lift up so high! ;-)
  
  Added comments: 1) To avoid oversalting, it should be better to season the
  batter after melting the roquefort. 2) You should replace Roquefort by
  another french blue of similar consistancy, or eventually a Bavarian blue.
  It should also be possible to attempt using Gorgonzola instead, but you
  will then certainly have to compensate the smoother taste by addition of 2
  ts celery salt, or 1 1/2 ts celery salt and 1/2 ts curry powder. Not
  tested, however.

      Title: Spinach & Stilton Pancakes
 Categories: Breads, Cheese/eggs, Vegetarian
      Yield: 18 Servings
 
------------------------------FOR THE PANCAKES------------------------------
      2 oz Buckwheat flour
      2 oz Plain white flour
      2    Eggs
      2 tb Butter; melted
    1/4 pt Milk
    1/4 pt Water

------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
      2 lb Fresh spinich
      1 lg Onion
      3 oz Stilton cheese
      2 oz Walnut pieces
           Butter
      1    Garlic sliver

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Plain white flour
    1/2 pt Stock
    1/4 pt Double cream
      2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
      1 ts (heaped) Dijon mustard
 
  Make a smooth batter with the flours, eggs, milk and water, then stir in
  the cool melted butter for extra richness and to prevent sticking during
  cooking.  Use a 6-inch pan and make thin pancakes in the usual way, but be
  sure to stir the batter vigorously in between making each pancake or all
  the buckwheat flour will sink to the bottom of the mixture. If preparing
  ahead, cool the pancakes then stack them (interleaved with greaseproof
  paper) and wrap in a foil parcel.
  
  To make the filling, wash and boil or steam the spinach until just tender.
  Chop it and squeeze out all the liquid (save the juices for a soup). Chop
  the onion finely and sweat it in a knob of butter until it's deliciously
  soft.  Stir in the spinach, season with a little salt, lots of pepper and
  the garlic.  Toast the walnuts and crumbled Stilton into the spinach
  mixture to give it savoury flavour and bite. Stuff the pancakes with the
  mixture, roll them up neatly and pile them into a lightly buttered gratin
  dish.  Cover with foil and heat through in the oven for 25-30 minutes at
  400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.
  
  Make a smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock (preferably good
  chicken stock) and cream.  Let it simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring once
  or twice, then season with the cheese, mustard and salt and pepper. If the
  sauce is made ahead, reheat it in a double-boiler for serving, then pour it
  over the dish of pancakes just before bringing to table.

      Title: Vanilla Bavarian Cream (CrŠme Bavarois … la Vanille)
 Categories: Dessert, Dairy, French, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    190 g  Castor sugar
      6    Egg yolks
      1 pn Salt (Tiny pinch)
    375 ml Milk
      1    Vanilla pod-=OR=-
    3/4 ts Vanilla extract
     10 g  Gelatine
    375 ml Whipping cream; whipped
     40 g  Powdered sugar
 
  Notes. Castor sugar is fine sugar. Whipping cream is a heavy cream with
  just enough butterfat content to whip. You can substitute 1 part double and
  1 part single. (US heavy and light). Powdered sugar is icing sugar, but you
  may use castor again.
  
    Put the milk into a heavy saucepan with the vanilla pod and the salt and
  heat gently. When the pod is soft, split it, and with the point of a knife
  extract the tiny seeds which you rinse off into the milk. It is traditional
  for vanilla bavarois to have these seeds when finished, to show the use of
  real vanilla. If you don't have vanilla pods, but only REAL vanilla extract
  (NEVER use artificial vanilla in this dish) add it to the milk with the
  gelatine later, but heat the milk anyway. Continue heating the milk gently
  while measuring the remaining ingredients and separating the eggs. As soon
  as it comes to the boil, turn off and allow to steep. If using powdered
  gelatine, sponge it by sprinkling it over some water in a cup, while
  stirring and then letting it sit to absorb it. If using leaf gelatine which
  is easier and less strong in flavour, place the sheets, one by one (to
  avoid dry spots stuck together) into cold water in a shallow dish. Let them
  absorb the water and become soft and pliable.
    Separate the egg yolks and put them in a large bowl. Start beating with
  an electric beater, and when they start to lighten in texture, add the
  castor sugar, a little at a time, beating the while. When all the sugar has
  been added, continue beating until the mixture is very thick, pale and
  forms the ribbon. By now the gelatine will be softened or sponged, so place
  it in a container in a hot water bath to dissolve/melt.
     Strain any skin and the vanilla pods out of the milk, but allow the
  seeds through. Rinse out the pan. Add the dissolved vanilla to the hot milk
  and add the mixture to the egg mixture, in a thin stream of drops, beating
  the while. When all is added, return the mixture to the pan and heat very
  gently stirring continuously until it thickens. This takes place at a
  temperature of around 170-175F. Take great care not to overheat the mixture
  or the yolks will curdle, and the preparation will be spoilt.
    As soon as the mixture coats the back of the wooden spoon well, remove
  from the heat, and start to cool in cold water, stirring from time to time
  while you continue with the next stage and changing the water when it warms
  up.
    If you intend to turn out the bavarois, prepare a mould by wiping lightly
  with a flavourless oil. If not, get a serving dish ready. In an ice cold
  bowl, whip the chilled cream until just beginning to thicken, then sprinkle
  over the powdered sugar and continue whipping until quite stiff. (It is
  quite in order to use one of the proprietory cream stabilisers - follow
  their instructions, but don't let the cream curdle and turn to butter).
  Return the whipped cream to the fridge. Have ready a bowl large enough to
  receive the combined cream and custard.
    When the custard gets cold, you will notice that is starts to set _very_
  lightly. It is more a change of texture than setting really. Immediately
  remove the pan from the cold water and pour the mixture into the large
  bowl. Add the whipped cream and cut and fold the two together delicately to
  produce a homogenous mixture. Immediately pour this into the mould or
  serving dish and leave to set in the fridge for at least 3 hours. [IMH
  Notes]
    I use vanilla sugar throughout this preparation, as well as flavouring my
  milk with vanilla pods. Vanilla sugar is castor sugar in which I store my
  vanilla pods.
    The watch points are three fold. 1 Making the custard. Temperature is
  critical, too cool and the mixture will not thicken, too hot and it
  curdles. I watch it like a hawk and use a thermometer. I also have a bowl
  of cold water ready to cool the mixture if I suspect it may be trying to
  curdle, though never need to use it. 2. using the gelatine. You must sponge
  and dissolve it fully before adding to the custard, and when cooling, you
  must get it to the point of setting but not beyond. When at the right
  point, the spoon begins to leave a "trace" through the custard, it is hard
  to describe but very easy to see. At this point you need to work fast to
  compose the bavarois, or the gelatine will set too far before the cream is
  folded in. 3. Whipping the cream. Again, not far enough and the cream will
  be too liquid to hold its shape, too far and the cream will start turning
  to butter. Have everything ice cold and don't recoil from using a cream
  stabiliser.

---------------------------INGREDIENTS FOR DOUGH---------------------------
      1 pk Active dry or fresh yeast
      1 ts Honey
    3/4 c  Warm water (105 to 115F)
  2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour

           -see recipe below.
           Toppings of your choice

----------------------------VEGETARIAN TOPPINGS----------------------------
      3 c  Grated mozzarella cheese
      2 c  Grated fontina cheese
      2 c  Sliced fresh artichoke
           -hearts, sliced
      2 c  Sliced eggplant, grilled
           -or sauteed
      4 tb Grated parmesan cheese
      1 ts Chopped fresh oregano

----------------------------CHILI AND GARLIC OIL----------------------------
      1    Whole head garlic, peeled,
           -cloves seperated
      2 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Chili flakes
 
  1.  In a small bowl dissolve the yeast and houey in 1/4 cup of the warm
  water.
  
  2.  In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt.
  pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil and when absorbed, scrape in the dissolved
  yeast.  Add remaining 1/2 cup of water and knead on low speed about 5
  minutes.
  
  3.  Turn out on board and knead 2 or 3 minutes longer.  Dough should be
  smooth and firm.  Let rise in a warm spot, covered with a damp towel, about
  30 minutes.  (dough will strech when lightly pulled).
  
  4.  Divid the dough into 4 balls, about 6 oz each.  Work each ball by
  pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4
  or 5 times.  Then on a smooth unfloured surface, roll the ball under the
  palm of your hand until the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. At
  this piont, the balls can be loosely covered with plastic wrap and
  refigerated for 1 or 2 days.
  
  5.  Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F.  Place a pizza stone in the oven.
  
  6.  To prepare each pizza, place a ball of dough on a lightly floured
  surface.  Press down on the center, spreading the dough, or roll a 7 to 8
  inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle.
  Brush lightly with oil and arrange the toppings of your choice (if using
  the vegetarian toppings place them in the order listed) only over the inner
  circle.
  
  7.  Arrange the pizza on the baking stone and bake 15 to 20 minutes, or
  until the pizzas are nicely browned.  Transfer to a firm surface and cut
  into slices with a pizza cutter.  Serve immediately.
  
  MMMMM-----------------Chili and garlic oil--------------------------
  
  1.  In a small sauce pan, combine the cloves of garlic and oil bring to a
  boil.  Turn down the heat and simmer until the garlic turns golden brown,
  10 to 15 minutes.
  
  2.  Let cool and then add the chili flakes.  Let sit for at least 2 hours
  before using.  Oil will last 2 to 3 weeks.
