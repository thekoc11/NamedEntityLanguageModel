           - at room temp                    1/2 c  Sercial madeira
    3/4 lb Mushrooms, finely chopped           2 ts Arrowroot, dissolved in
  2 1/2 tb Unsalted butter                     1 tb Cold water
    1/2 lb Pate de foie gras, at room t      1/2 c  Beef broth
           -mp                                 2 tb Black truffles, finely chopp
      1 lb Puff pastry                              -d
      1 lg Egg white, beaten                        Watercress for garnish
      1 lg Egg yolk beaten with           
 
  In a roasting pan, roast the beef in the middle of a preheated 400f oven
  for 25-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 120f. Let the
  fillet cool completely and discard the larding fat and strings. Skim the
  fat from the pan juices and reserve the juices. In a heavy skillet, cook
  the mushrooms in butter over mod-low heat, stirring, until all liquid they
  give off is evaporated and the mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper
  and let cool completely. Spread the fillet evenly with foie gras, covering
  the top and sides, and spread the mushrooms evenly over the foie gras. On a
  floured surface, roll one lb. of puff pastry into a rectangle about 20x12
  inches, or large enough to enclose the roast completely. Invert the fillet
  in the middle of the pastry and fold up the long sides to enclose it,
  brushing the edges of the dough with some egg white to seal them. Fold the
  ends of the dough over the fillet and seal with the egg white. Transfer the
  fillet, seam side down, to a jelly-roll pan and brush the dough with egg
  wash.  Roll out additional dough and cut out shapes with which to decorate
  the dough. After applying, brush with egg wash. Chill for at least 1 hour
  and up to 2 hours. Bake the fillet in the middle of a preheated 400f oven
  for 30 minutes.
   Reduce heat to 350f and bake an additional 5-10 minutes more or until a
  meat thermometer registers 130f for medium rare meat and the pastry is
  cooked through.  Let stand for 15 minutes. In a saucepan, boil the reserved
  pan juices and the Madeira until the mixture is reduced by one fourth. Add
  the arrowroot mixture, broth, truffles, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook
  the sauce over moderate heat, stirring, for 5 minutes or until thickened,
  being careful not to let it boil. Loosen the fillet from the pan,
  transfering it to a heated platter. Garnish with watercress. Serve the
  fillet cut into 3/4-inch thick slices, with the sauce. a 1966 Gourmet Mag.

  as soft peaks) and fold it into the nectarine mixture.
  
  Trim the Genoise and cut it into three layers, horizonally.
  
  Peach Syrup:    In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water.
  Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and stir in the
  schnapps.  Let the syrup cool to room temperature. Assembly: Center one
  layer in the bottom of a 9-1/2-inch springform pan and brush with half the
  peach syrup.  Pour half the mousse over the cake and top it with another
  layer of Genoise.  Brush with the remaining peach syrup and pour the
  remaining mousse over the cake, rapping on the side of the pan to expel any
  air bubbles and smoothing the surface. Chill for 2 hours, or until it is
  set.
  
  Peach Glaze:    In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over 3 Tbsp cold water
  and let it soften for 5 minutes.  In a small saucepan, combine the
  preserves and schnapps, bring mixture to a boil, stirring, and simmer it
  for 1 minute.  Remove pan from heat, add gelatin mixture, stirring until
  gelatin is dissolved, and strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a
  bowl, pressing hard on the solids.
  
  Assembly:      Pour all but about 2 Tbsp of Peach Glaze over top of the
  mousse cake, covering it completely, and chill the cake for 2 hours, or
  until glaze is set.
  
  While cake is chilling, in a food processor, grind the remaining Genoise
  layer into fine crumbs.  Toast the crumbs in a jelly-roll pan in a
  preheated 350f oven for 5-8 minutes or until they are golden. Reserve.
  
  Cut half the nectarine into thin slices, and arrange them decoratively on
  top of the cake in a pinwheel pattern.  Brush the remaining glaze over the
  nectarine slices and chill the cake, covered, for 1 hour, or until the
  newly applied glaze is set.
  
  Run a thin knife around the edge of the pan and remove the side of the pan.
  Working over a sheet of wax paper, coat sides of cake with the cake crumbs.
  
  Let cake stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving.

  fork.  Roll out remaining dough and make up another tart shell in the same
  manner.
  
  Chill the shells for 60 minutes.  Line the shells with foil, fill the foil
  with rice and bake in the lower third of a preheated 400f oven for 8
  minutes.  Remove the rice and foil, and bake for 8-10 minutes more or until
  they are pale golden.  Remove shells from the pans, transfer them to a rack
  and let them cool.
  
  In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 1/2 cup sugar
  until the mixture is thick and pale and forms a ribbon.  Beat in the zest
  and lemon juice.  Transfer the mixture to a heavy saucepan. Cook it,
  stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over mod-low heat, until it
  registers 140f on a candy thermometer. Continue to cook at a stable 140f
  for 3 minutes longer.  Do not let it boil.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl,
  and let it cool, covered with a buttered round of wax paper, until it is
  luke-warm.
  
  In a bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they hold soft
  peaks.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, one Tbsp at a time, and beat the
  meringue until it just hold stiff peaks.  Stir a quarter of the meringue
  into the lemon mixture and fold in the remaining meringue gently but
  thoroughly.
  
  Transfer the tart shells to a baking sheet and fill with the lemon mixture,
  mounding it slightly.  Bake the tarts in the middle of a preheated 400f
  oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the tops are golden and puffed. Transfer
  the tarts to a rack and let them cool.

  brown. This should take about 2 minutes for each batch. Drain on paper
  towels, and serve tails up, in a serving dish, with the salt/pepper mixture
  for dipping. Makes 8 to 10 appetizer servings.
  
  FOR DIPPING:  In a bowl, combine coarse salt and the peppercorns.  In a dry
  frying pan over high heat, brown the salt/pepper mixture.  When browned
  remove and run the mixture through a grinder.

      1 pk Active dry yeast                    2 tb Honey
      1 tb Kosher (or regular) salt            1    Egg white lightly beaten
  1 1/2 c  Warm water (110 to 115         
 
  In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine 1 cup of the flour, the yeast and
  salt.  Add the water and honey and beat until smooth. Add the remaining
  flour,1 cup at a time, to make a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a

      2 ts Crushed red pepper *           
 
  *  or you substitute 2 whole chili peppers, crushed. In a pot, poach the
  chicken breasts in a little boiling water for 10 minutes until white and
  opaque. In a dry frying pan, toast the Szechuan peppercorns over moderate
  heat, then crust or grind them; set aside. Remove the chicken breasts from
  the pot, drain and cool them.  Slice them, then shred the slices into
  julienne pieces. In a mixing bowl, combine the sesame paste and green tea
  (or the peanut butter and sesame oil -- See NOTE). Add the vinegar and soy
  sauce; blend well. Add the peanut oil, red pepper, ginger, scallion,
  garlic, sherry, cayenne pepper, and the peppercorns. Mix all ingredients
  very well. Toss the chicken strips in this sauce, to coat. Refrigerate
  until 20 minutes before serving. Pass the chicken and the lettuce leaves
  separately, and let each guest place a small portion of the chicken in the
  middle of a lettuce leaf and roll it up like an egg roll to eat using
  fingers.  Makes 6 appetizer servings.
  
  NOTE:  The authentic recipe calls for green tea to thin the sesame seed
  paste,
       but you may substitute chicken broth, or simply water, if you prefer.
       Another substitution you may make if you wish is peanut butter for the
       sesame seed paste along with sesame oil instead of green tea.
       This dish is served cold or at room temperature and can be made a day
       ahead . -- Verdi

-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
           Plum sauce                               Scallion, chopped
 
  Preheat the oven 10 375 degree F. Trim any excess fat from the ribs and
  place them in a long shallow dish. In a mixing bowl, combine the marinade
  ingredients; if you are using 5-spice powder, add it to the mixture by
  putting it through a tea strainer so it spreads out over the mixture. Mix
  well, and pour over the ribs and leave for 3 hours at room temperature or
  about 6 hours in the refrigerator.  Baste the ribs every hours or so,
  turning them over. TO ROAST THE RIBS: Remove the ribs from the marinade.
  Add the 1/4 cup plum sauce to the marinade; reserve it for basting. Hook
  metal drapery hooks through both ends of each rack of ribs, at the top, and
  hang each one as if you were hanging a hammock, suspended from the bars of
  one of the oven racks.  Set the oven rack in the highest position in the
  oven. On the floor of the oven or on another oven rack set at the lowest
  position in the oven, place a baking pan half filled with water, to collect
  drippings and prevent smoking. You may want to line the baking pan with
  aluminum foil before putting the water in, to make it easier to clean.
  Roast the spareribs for 45 minutes in the preheated oven.  Then baste them
  with the reserved basting sauce, using a small pastery brush and carefully
  pulling out the oven rack to facilitate the basting process. Turn the oven
  up to 450 degrees F and roast for another 15 minutes.  By this time the
  spareribs should be a rich golden brown with crisp edges.  Baste again,
  then take them out of the oven.  Place the ribs on a cutting board and
  remove the drapery hooks.  Separate the individual ribs with a cleaver or
  sharp knife.  Serve at room temperature, with dipping sauce.  Makes 6 to 8
  appetizer servings. NOTE: You will need about 12 drapery hooks. Recipe:
