Baked Sandwiches

sandwich, low cal

1 1/4 cup water at 110 to 115 f
2 1/4 teaspoon quick-rise yeast (1 pkg)
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1  egg
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 cup graham flour
1  filling
1 1/2 lb lean ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onions
1 cup tomato sauce
1/4 cup catsup
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon leaf oregano
1 pinch pepper

May be frozen.  Defrost in the fridge, on the way to a picnic or in
the microwave if you want them in a hurry.

Combine water and yeast in mixer bowl and let stand 5 minutes.  Add
all purpose flour and mix at medium speed for another 4 minutes.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead a few
times, form into a ball and place in a well-greased mixing bowl.
Turn the ball over to grease the top, cover with a cloth and let
stand at room temperature to rise until doubled in volume.

While the dough is rising, cook the meat and onions over medium heat,
stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and the meat is
browned. Drain.  Discard fat and juice, return meat and onions to the
pan.  Add tomato sauce, catsup, seasoning and cook over medium heat
until the meat is dry with no noticeable liquid.  Set meat mixture
aside to cool until dough is ready.

After the dough has doubled in volume, transfer it to a lightly
floured working surface.  Knead lightly.  Form into a roll and cut
into 12 equal portions.  Form each portion into a little ball, cover
with a cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.

Roll each ball out to form a circle 5 to 6 inches across.  Put about
1/4 cup of the meat mixture in the center of the circle.  Pull the
dough up around the filling and press together at the top.  Place on
a well greased cookie sheet, cover with a cloth and let stand about
30 to 40 minutes at room temperature or until doubled in volume.
Bake at 350 F for 40 to 45 minutes or until lightly browned and firm.
Serve hot, using 1 sandwich per serving, or refrigerate or freeze to
be used later.

Pork With Rhubarb Sauce

low cal, pork

3 lb pork loin center rib roast (8 ribs)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper; coarsely ground
1/2 lb rhubarb, fresh; chopped (2 cups)
1/4 cup apple juice concentrate; thawed
2 tablespoon honey
1  nutmeg, ground
2 tablespoon ; water
1 teaspoon cornstarch

Have the butcher loosen the pork roast backbone, if possible, for
easier carving.  Rub the roast with salt and pepper. Place bone side
down in a small, shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into
the thickest portion of the roast; make sure bulb doesn't touch bone,
fat, or the pan. Roast, uncovered, at 325 F. until the thermometer
reads 150 F., about 75 to 90 minutes.

For the sauce, in a medium saucepan stir together the rhubarb, apple
juice concentrate, honey, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil; reduce the
heat, cover, and simmer ten minutes or until the rhubarb is very
tender. Mix the water and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture.
Cook and stir until the sauce is thickened and bubbly. Continue
cooking for two minutes more.

When the meat thermometer registers 150 F., spoon some of the sauce
over the roast.  Continue roasting until the thermometer reads 170
F., about 30 to 45 minutes more. Spoon on additional sauce
occasionally. Let the roast stand 15 minutes before carving.  Heat
any remaining sauce and pass with the roast.

MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Prepare and roast the pork as directed. For the
sauce, in a 1 1/2-quart microwave casserole cook the rhubarb, apple
juice concentrate, honey and nutmeg, covered, on HIGH until the
rhubarb is very tender, about five to seven minutes.  Mix the water
and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture. Cook, uncovered, until
the sauce is thickened and bubbly, about one to two minutes, stirring
every 30 seconds. Continue cooking for one minute more. Spoon over
the roast as directed and pass the remainder with the roast.
