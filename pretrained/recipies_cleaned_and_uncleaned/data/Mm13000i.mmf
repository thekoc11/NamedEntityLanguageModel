      Title: Asparagus Soup (Zuppa Di Asparagi)
 Categories: Italian, Soups/stews, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil              1 qt Chicken broth
      2    Cloves garlic, minced               4    Eggs
      2 lb Asparagus, trimmed, peeled        1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan or
           -and cut (1 inch pieces)                 -pecorino cheese
           Salt and pepper                     6 sl Italian bread, toasted
 
  Heat the oil and garlic in a soup pot until the garlic is golden. Add the
  asparagus and cook until they begin to color.  Season with salt and pepper.
  Add the broth and bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer for 15
  minutes, or until the asparagus is tender.
  
  Beat the eggs and cheese together.  When the asparagus is tender, reduce
  the heat so the soup is no longer simmering.  Very slowly ladle some of the
  hot soup into the beaten eggs, stirring continuously.  After adding about 2
  cups of the hot soup to the eggs, reverse the process and gradually stir
  the eggs mixture into the soup pot.  The soup must not boil or the eggs
  will scramble.  Heat until thickened.
  
  Put one slice of toasted bread into each soup dish.  Ladle the hot soup on
  top and pass additional grated cheese.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  To trim asparagus, hold the tip in one hand and the base of the
  stalk in the other.  Bend gently.  The asparagus will snap, leaving the
  tender part with the tip.

      Title: August Goerg's Grilled Steak (Spiessbraten August Goerg)
 Categories: Beef, German
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Shallot or small onion cut          1 pn Mace
           -into small pieces                  1 lg Steak (just over 1 lb), at
           Freshly ground black pepper              -least 1 1/4 inches
 
  ((Note:  Per Horst Scharfenberg, this recipe originated in the town of
  Idar-Oberstein in the 19 th century, when gemstone prospectors returning
  from South America created their own version of gaucho-grilled steaks. The
  dish was then further refined by Scharfenberg's mentor August Goerg. K.B.))
  
  Per person: thick, trimmed
  
  Mix together the shallot or onion with the pepper and mace. Insert a few
  shallot pieces into the steak using the point of a small knife.  Coat the
  steak with the shallot mixture, pressing it in so it will adhere.
  
  Remove the loose shallot pieces and grill the steak (over a fire of oak
  logs, says August Goerg, from which the bark has been removed).*  Take the
  steaks off the grill while they are still pink inside.  Sprinkle them with
  salt.
  
  *Note:  A special grill is used, suspended with 3 chains from an iron
  tripod and constantly swinging through the flames.

      Title: Austrian Bread Dumplings
 Categories: Ethnic, Breads
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 oz Dry bread, diced                         Salt and pepper
    1/2 oz (1 Tbsp) butter or lard             1 tb Chopped fresh herbs
      1    Egg                                      -(parsley, chervil,
    1/2 c  Milk                                     -marjoram) -
      3 oz (3/4 cup) flour                
 
  1 Tbsp     chopped fresh herbs (parsley, chervil, marjoram) - optional, but
  a great improvement
  
  You will need a frying pan, a large and a small bowl, and a saucepan of
  water or soup.  Fry the diced bread lightly in the fat in a frying pan.
  Meanwhile, mix the egg and the milk in a small bowl.  Tip the contents of
  the frying pan into a large bowl, and pour the egg and milk over all.  Stir
  in the flour, and season with salt and pepper.  Add the herbs, if using.
  You may need more milk to make a soft dough.  Allow it to stand for 1/2 an
  hour.
  
  Dip your hand into cold water and roll the mixture into a dozen small
  balls.  Put a pot of salted water on to boil, if there isn't a simmering
  soup pot waiting.  Drop little balls of dough into the boiling salted water
  or the soup.  Poach them for 10 to 15 minutes, until they are light and
  firm and well risen.
  
  Yield:  12 dumplings Time: 1 hour
  
  Notes:  You may include chopped fried bacon or cubed pork cracklings in the
  mixture.  Leaving out flour will result in a lighter dumpling.

           -yeast                              1 c  (135 grams) unbleached
      1    Scant tsp. malt syrup                    -all-purpose flour
 
  This takes 2 days but is worth the wait. Makes 2 round loaves Starter
  
  Stir the yeast and malt into the water; let stand until foamy, about 10
  minutes. Stir in the milk and beat in the flour with a rubber spatula or
  wooden spoon about 100 strokes until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and
  let stand until bubbly, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.

  bowl as necessary, until the dough is elastic but slightly sticky, 3 to 4
  minutes. Finish kneading by hand on a floured work surface.
  
  First rise Place in a well-oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and
  let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. The dough is ready when it is
  very bubbled and blistered.
  
  Shaping and second rise Cut the dough in half on a floured surface and
  shape into 2 round loaves. Place on an oiled cookie sheet sprinkled with
  cornmeal. Cover and let rise till doubled, about 1 hour.

  Remove  sausage  casings and crumble sausage.   Brown  meat  in large pot,
  stirring occasionally to break up the meat.   Drain off fat.
  
  Remove meat and set aside.  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in the  same pot, add
  onion, garlic and bell pepper and cook  over  medium heat, stirring
  occasionally, about 5 to 8  minutes  or  until onion is tender.
  
  Stir  in the reserved meat, tomato puree, tomato paste,  water, basil,
  oregano, sugar, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon  pepper and bay leaf and
  bring to boil.  Cover and  simmer,  stirring occasionally, about 2 hours,
  or  until  flavors  mingle  and mixture thickens slightly (there will be
  about 4 1/2 to 5  cups of sauce).
  
  Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, egg, 1/4 teaspoon salt,  and 1/4
  teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl; set aside.
  
  Bring  3  quarts  of  water to boil in  a  large  pot.   Add  1 tablespoon
  salt,  then gradually add lasagne noodles  so  that water continues to
  boil.  Cook noodles until  barely  tender, about 5 minutes, stirring once

  prevent them sticking.

  noodles, cutting one as necessary to completely  cover the bottom. Spread
  evenly with half of  ricotta  mixture  (1 generous cup). Sprinkle evenly
  with half of mozarella (about 2 cups). Spread with half of the tomato/meat
  sauce.
  
  Top  with remaining 4 noodles, cutting one noodle as  above  so that the
  sauce mixture is completely covered.  Evenly layer  on remaining
  ingredients in the same order as above.  Sprinkle the top of the lasagne
  evenly with 1/4 cup Parmesan and  1/4  cup mozzarella.
  
  Bake  in a preheated oven at 375 for about 45 or 50 minutes  or until
  lasagne is hot in center.  Remove from oven;  let  stand for 15 minutes.
  Cut in squares and serve on heated plates  with garlic bread.

      Title: Baked Stuffed Squid
 Categories: Greek, Fish/sea
      Yield: 5 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/4 c  Chopped fresh mint leaves
      1 lb Squid                               2 tb White wine
           Salt                              1/4 c  Pine nuts
      6 tb Olive oil                         1/4 c  Black raisins
      1    Onion; chopped                           Freshly ground pepper
    1/3 c  Raw long-grain white rice           4    Peeled tomatoes; drained
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley             1/3 c  White wine
 
  Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs from the heads and
  tentacles, removing and discarding the translucent cartilage, and small
  sand bag and ink.  Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them inside and out
  with cold water.  Heads and tentacles should be rinsed thoroughly and
  cooked along with the sacs after you stuff the latter.  Drain and set
  aside.
  
  Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a heavy frying pan, then add the onion and cook,
  without browning, until transparent.  Stir in the rice and saute a few
  minutes, until golden.  Blend in the parsley, mint, 2 tablespoons wine,
  pine nuts, and raisins, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add
  enough water to half cover and cook for a few minutes, then stuff the squid
  sacs with the mixture using a very small spoon and allowing enough liquid
  in each for the rice to cook.  Seal opening with skewers or toothpicks.
  Place the stuffed sacs with the heads and tentacles in a baking-serving
  dish.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside.
  
  Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes, 1/3 cup wine, and a little salt and pepper
  in a small saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes.  Pour the sauce over the
  squid and dribble the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over the top. Bake
  in a medium-slow oven (300 F) for 1 1/2 hours or until the squid and rice
  are tender and the sauce has thickened.  Serve warm or cold.

      Title: Baklava Rolls
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Walnuts, finely chopped         1 1/2 c  Water
  2 1/2 tb Sugar                               1    Cinnamon Stick
    1/2 ts Cinnamon                            2 ts Lemon Juice
    1/8 ts Ground Cloves                     1/2 c  Honey
           Syrup:                              1 lb Phyllo Dough
  1 1/2 c  Sugar                             3/4 lb Unsalted Butter, melted
 
  Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix first four ingredients together for filling.
  Combine syrup ingredients and cook until sugar dissolves and mixture turns
  syrupy. Set aside to cool. Remove cinnamon stick before using.
  
  To Assemble:
  
  Unfold phyllo. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut phyllo sheets crosswise,
  into thirds. Cover phyllo not being used with a barely damp towel. Using
  two pieces of phyllo - phyllo sheets are so thin they must be doubled - and
  keeping narrow ends towards you, brush with butter. Place 1 to 1 1/2
  teaspoons filling 1/4 inch from end nearest you, to within 1/4 inch of
  sides. Fold long sides in 1/4 inch. Fold over bottom to cover filling.
  
  Place a clean pencil on top of fold and roll into a cigar-like cylinder.
  
  Push both ends toward center and remove pencil. Place roll on cookie sheet
  and generously brush with butter. Repeat with remaining filling and phyllo.
  
  Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Dip hot rolls into cooled syrup -
  kitchen tongs work well for this. Place onto a platter to cool. Cover and
  refrigerate. Can be frozen.

    1/2 c  Zwieback crumbs                     1 lb Phyllo pastry sheets
      4 tb Granulated sugar                1 1/2 c  Sweet butter; melted
 
  *Note: Either toasted blanched almonds, or walnut meats, or half of each,
  (finely chopped) may be used.
  
  Cooky Filling:  Cream the 2 cups sweet butter until light.  Gradually beat
  in the confectioners' sugar and continue to beat until mixture is fluffy.
  Add egg yolk and vanilla or almond extract and blend well.  Work in about 4
  cups flour to make a medium-soft dough.  Set aside and make syrup.
  
  Syrup:  In a saucepan combine the granulated sugar and water.  Bring to a
  boil and boil for 15 minutes or until syrup is slightly thick.  Add honey
  and again bring to the boiling point.  Add lemon juice to taste, and cool.
  
  Mix almonds or walnuts, or a combination of the two, with zwieback, 4 T
  granulated sugar, and cinnamon.  Brush 2 sheets of phyllo pastry evenly
  with butter and sprinkle with nut mixture.  Place 2 buttered sheets of
  phyllo on top and sprinkle with nut mixture.  Shape a portion of cooky
  filling into a 1/2-inch-thick roll and place the roll along one edge of the
  pastry sheets.  Roll up loosely, cut into 2-inch slices, and place slices
  in a buttered cake pan.  (Continue in this method until all phyllo pastry
  and/or cooky filling is used.)  Brush tops of each slice with butter and
  bake in a 350 F oven for 20 minutes or until lightly browned. Dip the hot
  baklava slices, one at a time, in cold syrup, allowing each piece to remain
  in the syrup for a few minutes.

 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 24 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    3/4 lb Sweet butter; melted
      1 lb Phyllo pastry sheets          

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      3 c  Milk                              1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Sugar                             1/2 c  Fine grain semolina

-----------------------------------SYRUP-----------------------------------
  2 2/3 c  Sugar                               2 tb Lemon juice
      2 c  Water                          
 
  Preheat oven to 350 F after the filling has been prepared.
  
  Divide the pastry into 2-equal parts.  Lay 1 sheet on a well-buttered 11 x
  16 inch baking pan.  Brush surface generously with melted butter.  Lay
  second sheet on top of first and butter.  Repeat until half of the pastry
  sheets have been used.
  
  Cover unused half of pastry sheets with a kitchen cloth to prevent drying.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Over medium heat bring milk, sugar and salt to a boil
  in a saucepan.  Add farina by sprinkling in a little at a time, stirring
  constantly until the mixture thickens and the farina is well cooked.
  
  Spread the hot farina mixture evenly over the entire surface of pastry
  sheets.  Again build up the remaining half of the pastry sheets, buttering
  each surface generously, on top of farina.  Pour the remaining butter over
  the top.  Cut pastry sheets into 24 equal squares.  Bake for 40 to 45
  minutes or until light golden.
  
  While the baklava is cooking prepare syrup:  Place sugar, water, and lemon
  juice in a saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until
  sugar is dissolved.  Bring to a boil and simer for 15 minutes without
  stirring.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.
  
  Remove baklava from oven.  Pour off all excess butter by tilting the pan.
  Cook for 10 minutes.  Brush surface lightly with some of the drained butter
  to give luster to the pastry.  Pour syrup over a little at a time, until
  all is absorbed.  Allow to cool for several hours.

  " This is a vegetarian version of a Bedouin dish. If you serve it with
  rice, try adding saffron or tumeric to the rice before cooking. It adds a
  distinctive flavor as well as color, creating 'red' rice."
    Peel the onions and place them in a large pan of boiling water. Reduce
  the heat and let them simmer for 15-20 minutes, covered, until they are
  fairly tender. When they are ready, take them out and set aside to cool.
    Now remove the centre section of each onion, to leave a shell about 3/4
  inch thick.
    In a bowl, mix together the lentils, pepper, salt, yogurt, dates,
  walnuts, raisins or sultanas and bread crumbs.
    Fill the onions with this mixture. Keep any that remains and mix it with
  the chopped discarded onion centres.
    Place the filled onions in an oven proof dish, spoon any remaining
  mixture around them and cook for about 20 minutes. Garnish with parsley
  ands serve with bulgur or 'red' rice (see note above).

      Title: Basel Chocolate-Spice Cookies (Basel Brunsli)
 Categories: Cookies, Swedish
      Yield: 2 servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Blanched whole almonds                   Chocolate, chopped fairly
           -(about 7 ounces)                        -fine
  1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar                    1/4 ts (generous) almond extract
  3 1/2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder            2 lg Egg whites
  2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon                     2    To 5 Tbl confectioners'
    1/8 ts Ground cloves                            -sugar for rolling out
      3 oz Bitterswet (not unsweetened)             -cookies
           -or swmisweet                  
 
  Heat oven to 325F.  Line several baking sheets with aluminum foil.
  
  In a food processor, process the almonds and 1 cup powdered sugar until the
  almonds are powder-fine but not oily; stop the processor and scrape down
  the sides several times.  Add the cocoa powder, cinnamon, cloves, and
  chocolate; continue processing until the chocolate is finely ground.  Add
  the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, the almond extract, and egg whites;
  process until the mixture is blended and just forms a mass.  Set the dough
  aside for 5 to 10 minutes to stiffen slightly.
  
  Generously dust a work surface with powdered sugar.  If the dough seems too
  soft to roll out easily, dust it with more sugar and knead until the
  consistency is manageable, but avoid adding any more sugar than absolutely
  necessary.  Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness, lifting it with a
  spatula frequently and redusting the surface and rolling pin with powdered
  sugar to prevent sticking.  Cut out the cookies using a 2 1/4-inch
  heart-shaped (or similar) cutter.  Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to
  the prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart.
  
  Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes or until almost firm on top and
  slightly puffy.  Let them stand on the foil lined baking sheets until
  completely cooled.  Peel from the foil.  Store airtight for 3 to 4 days.
  Freeze, airtight, for longer storage.
  
  Makes about forty 2 1/4-inch cookies.

      Title: Basel Honey-Spice Cookies (Basel Leckerli)
 Categories: Cookies, Swedish
      Yield: 50 servings
 
    2/3 c  Clover honey                             -peel
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar                  1/4 c  Finely chopped candied
      1 tb Kirsch (cherry brandy) or                -orange peel
           -orange juice                     2/3 c  Finely chopped blanched
  2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon                          -slivered almonds
    1/4 ts Ground cloves                   2 1/4 c  All-purpose or unbleached
           Finely grated peel (yellow               -white flour (or more)
           -part only) of one              1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
           Large lemon                       1/8 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 c  Finely chopped candied lemon   
 
  Heat the oven to 350F.  Generously grease two 10-by-14-inch or larger
  baking shets.  Stir together the honey, sugar, and kirsch in a medium-sized
  saucepan over medium heat.  Heat the mixture, stirring, until the sugar
  completely dissolves and the mixture is hot but not boiling.  Remove from
  the heat and stir in the spices, lemon peel, candied peels, and almonds
  until completely incorporated.  Stirring vigorously, gradually ad 2 1/4
  cups of flour to the pan; the mixture will become very stiff.  If the
  mixture feels sticky and too soft to roll out, stir or knead in a bit more
  flour, but be careful not to overflour.  Set the mixture aside until cooled
  to barely warm.
  
  Sprinkle a work surface generously with flour.  Divide the dough in half.
  Roll out half of dough into an 8 1/2-by-13-inch rectangle, frequently
  running a spatula under the dough and dusting the work surface.  As needed,
  also dust the top of the dough and the rolling pin with flour.  Transfer
  the dough to a prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with the second half of the
  dough.  Prick the dough lightly all over with the tines of a fork.
  
  Stagger the baking sheets on racks in the center third of the oven; switch
  positions halfway through the baking to ensure even browning.  Bake for 13
  to 16 minutes or until the dough top is just tinged with brown and slightly
  darker on the edges; avoid overbaking, as cookies will become crunchy and
  hard.  Carefully run a spatula under the dough rectangles to loosen them
  from the pans.
  
  When just cool enough to handle, transfer the rectangles to a cutting board
  and cut away any uneven, dry edges using a large serrated knife.  Deeply
  score the rectangles, but do not cut completely through the surface,
  lengthwise and crosswise, to yield 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars. Return the scored
  rectangles to the baking sheets.  In a small saucepan stir together the
  powdered sugar, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons of water until thoroughly
  blended.  Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring.  Boil, stirring, for 20 to
  30 seconds, until smooth, very fluid, and translucent.  Divide the mixture
  between the rectangles, pour over the top and quickly spread the glaze over
  the entire surface.  Let stand until the glaze sets and turns white again,
  about 1 hour.  Bend the rectangles to break apart or cut through the score
  marks to separate into bars.  Let stand until the glaze is dry and hard.
  Pack airtight.  Store for up to 3 weeks or more.
  
  Makes 50 to 60 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars.

      4 oz Blanched almonds                  1/4 ts Salt
  2 1/2 c  Flour                             1/4 ts Baking soda
      2 c  Granulated sugar                    3    Eggs
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and toast them in
  oven until lightly golden. Let cool. Coarsely chop half the nuts. Butter 2
  large baking sheets. Mix flour, sugar, salt and baking soda. Beat in eggs,
  then whole and chopped nuts. Mix to obtain a firm dough. Knead briefly,
  then divide dough into 4 pieces. On a floured work surface, roll each piece
  under your hands into a cylinder 15 inches long and about 1 1/2 inches in
  diameter. Place 2 rolls, well separated, on each baking sheet and bake 15
  to 20 minutes, until very lightly browned and firm to the touch. With a
  spatula, carefully transfer the rolls to a cutting board and slice each one
  diagonally into cookies about 1/2-inch thick. Set wire racks on the baking
  sheets and lay out the biscotti on them. Return them to the oven for 20 to
  30 minutes, or until very firm and crisp. Cool on the racks, then transfer
  them to a tin for long keeping.
  
  Try adding 1 1/2-to-2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to this
  recipe for a nice variation.

      Title: Basic Potato Dumplings
 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8 md Potatoes                                 - 2-1/2 Cups
      1    Egg Yolk                            1 tb Vegetable Oil
      1 tb Salt                              1/4 c  Butter
      2 c  All-Purpose Flour, Up To          1/2 c  Grated Parmesan Cheese
 
  Puncture potatoes in several places with a fork.  Bake 1 hour in a 350F
  oven or until tender.  Remove and discard skins.  Mash potatoes through a
  ricer or food mill into a large bowl, and let cool a little.  Add egg yolk,
  salt, and 2 cups flour.  Mix well.  Knead dough on work surface or board
  into a ball.  It should be soft and a little sticky.  If it's too sticky,
  add a little flour.  Lightly flour surface and hands.  Break dough into
  egg-size pieces.  Roll until thickness of thumb.  Cut roll into 1-inch
  pieces.  Push each Gnocchi against the back of a fork to imprint a pattern.
  This helps them absorb more sauce (and makes them a little prettier).
  Arrange them on a floured tray.  Fill a large saucepan 2/3 full with salted
  water.  Bring to a boil.  Add oil and dumplings. Stir, to make sure they
  don't stick t bottom.  When they come to surface, let them cook 10-12
  seconds more.  Remove with a slotted spoon as they are done. They get soggy
  if overcooked (they absorb more moisture than regular pasta). Serve with
  butter and Parmesan cheese or your favorite sauce.

      Title: Batter Fried Sage Leaves (Salbey Zu Backen)
 Categories: German
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 c  (scant) flour                       1    Egg white
      3 tb Cold water                          1 tb Melted butter that has been
      1    Egg, beaten                              -allowed to cool
           A few tablespoons white wine        1 pn Salt
           -(or hard cider)                    1 pn (small) sugar
 
  This recipe is taken almost verbatim from a cookbook originally published
  in 1709; the language has been slightly modernized, but only 2 ingredients
  have been added (sugar and salt).
  
  plenty of nice fresh sage leaves oil or shortening for deep frying
  
  Take the flour and mix with the cold water into a thick batter that must be
  smooth.  Then mix in the beaten egg and stir well; pour in a little sour
  wine, yet not too much.  Beat the egg white into soft peaks and fold into
  the batter.  Finally, add the butter as well as a very little salt and
  sugar and stir the batter once more.  Wash and dry off the sage leaves,
  dredge them in the batter, and fry them on both sides in hot lard (see
  Note) until crispy.
  
  Note:  I [=Horst Scharfenberg] would suggest that you fold in the egg white
  last of all and let the batter sit for about 30 minutes beforehand. Also,
  vegetable oil or shortening is recommended for deep frying rather than
  lard.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: Bavarian Herb Soup (Krautlsuppe)
 Categories: Soups/stews, German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Herbs *                             1 qt Water or vegetable stock
      4 tb Butter                              1 lg Potato, peeled and chopped
      1 lg Onion, chopped                           -into small cubes
 
  Serves 4.
  
  salt and pepper bread cubes for croutons
  
  * at least 3 of these:  chervil, watercress, spinach, sorrel (dandelion and
  pimpernel for brave souls) Bitter herbs are traditionally eaten at Easter
  in Christian countries as a sign of penitence. This Bavarian soup is served
  on Easter Thursday, known as Maundy Thursday. Fresh chervil, easily
  available in any German market, is usually the dominating flavor. This is a
  delicate fresh-tasting soup for any time of the year.
  
  You will need a large saucepan.  Pick over and wash the herbs, stripping
  the leaves from those stalks which are too woody.  Chop the rest.
  
  Melt the butter in a deep pan and fry the onion gently until transparent.
  Add the herbs and sweat them for a moment before you pour in the water or
  broth.  Add the potato to the soup. Bring the soup to a boil, and then turn
  down the heat.  Simmer for 20 minutes.  Mash the potato in the soup to
  thicken it a little.  Taste, and add salt and freshly milled pepper.
  
  Serve with bread croutons fried in butter or bacon fat (goose fat is even
  better).  They should be so hot that they sizzle when they are added to the
  hot soup at the table.

  continue until all the meat is browned, adding fresh oil as needed. If the
  oil has burned or more oil is needed, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of
  oil to the pot. When it is hot, add the onions and cook for 6-to-7 minutes

  The Berberes are a nomadic tribe in northern Africa.  Fenugreek is a
  rectangle-shaped seed with a pleasantly bitter flavor.  Look for it in
  Indian and Middle Eastern grocery stores.  I have used this marinade with
  great success on tuna, pork tenderloin and sirloin steak.
  
  * Juice of 1 lemon (1/4 cup)
  
  Finely chop onion.  Mince garlic and ginger.  Place onions, garlic, ginger,
  peppercorns, red pepper, coriander, cardamom, fenugreek, cinnamon, cloves,
  allspice, salt and paprika in dry skillet and cook over medium heat 3 to 4
  minutes, or until spices are lightly roasted and fragrant. Combine roasted
  spice mixture, olive oil and lemon juice in blender and puree to smooth
  paste.  Spread paste on meat and marinate overnight. WARNING: A little of
  this spicy mixture goes a long way!
  
  Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 pounds tuna, pork tenderloin and sirloin
  steak.

      Title: Biscotti All'anice
 Categories: Cookies, Italian
      Yield: 48 servings
 
      3    Eggs                            1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Anise extract                     1/4 c  Cornstarch
    3/4 c  Sugar                             1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 pn Salt                           
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine the eggs, extract, sugar and salt in a mixing
  bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer and whip with a hand mixer set at
  high speed or in a heavy duty mixer fitted with the whip. Continue whipping
  until the mixture is very light and increased in volume, 6-7 minutes. While
  the egg mixture is whipping, combine the flour, cornstarch and baking
  powder and stir to mix. Remove the whipped eggs from the mixer and sift
  over the flour mixture in three additions, folding it in after each
  addition with a rubber spatula. The batter will lose most of its air and
  become rather stiff. Pipe the batter, using a pastry bag with a 3/4-inch
  opening, but no tube, onto a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper or
  buttered wax paper. Pipe two logs about 1 1/2 inches wide and the length of
  the pan. Bake the logs about 20 minutes, until they are well risen and
  golden. Remove from  oven and place logs on a cutting board to cool about
  10 minutes. Using a sharp, serrated knife, slice the logs diagonally at
  1/2-inch intervals. Place the biscotti cut side down on the pan and return
  them to the oven for about 10-15 minutes, until they color lightly on the
  cut surfaces. Cool the biscotti on the pans and store them in a tin between
  layers of wax paper.

           -finely ground                    1/3 c  Honey
    1/2 ts Bicarbonate of ammonia; -OR-      1/3 c  Water
    1/2 ts - Baking powder _AND_          
 
  Be careful with the first baking of these biscotti. Even though they are
  baked a second time after being cut, if they do not bake sufficiently the
  first time, the biscotti will have a hard, heavy core.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine all ingredients except honey and water in a
  mixing bowl and stir a minute or 2 to mix. Add the honey and water and stir
  until a firm dough forms. Remove dough from bowl and divide in half. Roll
  each half into a log about 15 inches long. Place both logs, well apart, on
  a jelly roll pan lined with parchment or buttered wax paper. Bake about 30
  minutes, until well risen, firm and a dark golden color. Remove from oven,
  cool logs slightly and place on a cutting board. Slice the logs diagonally
  at 1/2-inch intervals. Return the cut biscotti to the pan, cut side down,
  and bake an additional 15 minutes, until lightly colored and dry. Cool on
  the pan. Store in a tin--they keep well.

     12    Oysters, fresh or frozen                 Salt and pepper; to taste
      1 c  Flour                          
 
  Use only the large Asiatic oysters caught in the Indian Ocean, Black Sea,
  or the Persian and Arabian gulfs.
  
  Use the delicious white meat only.  Discard the round white bone sometimes
  discovered inside the shell -- or give it to some Persian.  They seem to
  prefer these bones to gold; they call them "pearls".
     *********************************************************************
  
  Drain oysters.  Roll in flour.  Heat oil until hot in a large frying pan.
  Fry oysters on medium-high heat for 5 minutes turning over once.  Sprinkle

  This spinach and yogurt dish is Persian in origin, The yogurt is redolent
  with both musky and sweet spices complementing the slightly tart taste of
  the spinach. Borani Esfanah is enjoyed as an appetizer, side dish, or dip
  to spread on bread.  Though untraditional, the hot pepper flavoring adds
  zip. Accompany with French bread, or pita; or, for a more tactile
  experience, tear off pieces of warm, soft flour tortillas and scoop up the
  savory mixture.
  
  salt
  
  1.  Saute onion and garlic in butter until soft.  Add spices and cook a few
  minutes to rid them of any rawness
  
  2.  Mix in spinach, yogurt, and salt to taste.
  
  RECOMMENDED WINE:
  
  Drink a slightly sweet Gewutztraminer or California riesling (German
  rieslings fade at the spicy assertion of this dish).

      Title: Bougatsa
 Categories: Desserts, Greek
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                           Granulated sugar
    1/2 lb Cream cheese                      1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
      1 lb Fresh ricotta cheese               18    Sheets commercial filo
      1 lb Fresh lg-curd cottage cheese      1/2 c  Butter (or more); melted
 
  Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese at high speed until light
  and fluffy.  Lower the speed and add the ricotta, cottage cheese, 1 1/2
  tablespoons sugar, and the nutmeg.  Beat for 1 minute at high speed, then
  set aside while you prepare the filo.
      Lay the filo flat on a table and keep covered with a damp towel over
  waxed paper or plastic wrap.  By stacking 4 sheets, form a base of 15 x 18
  inches, brushing the top of each sheet with melted butter as you stack
  them.  Then lay 2 sheets at right angles over the center, using the "base"
  as a diamond, not a square, brushing the center of each with butter. Divide
  the filling into 3 parts and spread one part over the filo to form a 7-inch
  square.  Set the rest of the filling aside.  Fold the top filo sheet over
  the cheese and brush with butter, and continue folding the filo over the
  cheese to make a square, brushing each time with butter.  With a wide
  spatula, lift the bougatsa and invert onto a cookie sheet.  Brush the top
  with butter and set aside.
      Repeat with the remaining filo, filling until all 3 square pies are
  folded.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until the filo
  puffs up and turns a golden chestnut color.  Cut into small squares and
  sprinkle with additional sugar.  Serve piping hot. Source: "The Food of

  Place beans in large saucepan. Add enough water to cover beans by 1 inch.
  Bring to boil over high heat. Boil 1 minute. Remove pan from heat; cover
  tightly and let stand 1 hour. (Or soak beans overnight in large bowl with
  enough cold water to cover by 1 inch.) Drain. Combine beans in 5-quart
  Dutch oven or soup kettle with chicken broth, celery, carrots, onions, and
  lemon zest. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer,
  uncovered, until liquid is just below surface of beans and ingredients are
  very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Using slotted spoon, transfer soup solids in
  batches to food processor and puree. Transfer puree to large bowl and add
  cooking liquid. (Or puree solids and liquids together in blender. Or force
  soup through coarse sieve or pass it through food mill, discarding skins.)
  Return soup to Dutch oven. Stir in lemon juice, salt and pepper and cook
  over medium heat, stirring constantly, until heated through. Place lemon
  quarter in bottom of each bowl. Pour in soup and serve immediately. Makes
  about 3 quarts of 10-12 servings.

      Yield: 16 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    3/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
      6 bn Scallions                                Salt
           -(white part & 1" green)                 Freshly ground black pepper
           -chopped, to make about 3 c.        8    Filo pastry sheets; thawed
    1/2 c  Olive oil                           2 tb Sesame seeds
 
  Toss the chopped scallions in a bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil, the
  chopped dill, salt and pepper.
  
  Remove 8 sheets of filo from the package. Reseal package and refrigerate
  it.  Cover the filo you are using with a damp dish towel, well wrung out,
  and try to work hastily, as the pastry sheet have a tendency to dry out.
  
  Lay out one sheet of filo and brush thoroughly with olive oil.  Lay a
  second sheet over the first, and brush again with olive oil.  Leaving a
  margin of 1 inch down one short side of the filo, sprinkle one-fourth of
  the scallion mixture in a strip.  Roll up from the same side, to make a
  long tube, packing the ends well.  Place on a greased baking sheet.
  
  Repeat this procedure three more times.  Cut each tube diagonally into four
  sections, brush with olive oil, and sprinkle the tops with sesame seeds.
  Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F until the tops are crisp and golden
  brown - about 30 minutes.  They are good hot or cold.

      Title: Buttered Oranges
 Categories: Londontowne, Desserts
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      5    Oranges; large, juicy               4 oz Butter; 1/2 cup
      4 tb Sugar                               1 c  Heavy cream
      6    Egg yolks                                Crystallized violets;for
      2 tb Sherry                                   -decoration, optional
      1 ts Rosewater; optional            
 
  "A recipe for Buttered Oranges can be found in Ann Blendcowe's cookery book
  published in 1694; they are also sometimes referred to as Nell Gwynn's
  Buttered Oranges, as she was believed to have served them to Charles II.
  Buttered Oranges are delicious, and they look spectacular."
  
  To prepare the Orange Shells: Hold the orange so the stalk (or navel) is at
  the base and using a small knife cut off the top about two inches down.
  Scoop out all the flesh, being carefully not to break the skin. This can be
  done quite easily with a teaspoon. Using a pair of scissors, cut off the
  stalk that remains in the bottom, wash the orange and set it aside (the top
  can be discarded). Repeat this procedure with three more of the oranges.
  Grate the peel off the remaining orange and then squeeze the juice from
  this orange into the bowl. Place the flesh you have extracted from the
  other oranges in the sieve and squeeze the juice in the same bowl. Mix the
  juice with the sugar and egg yolks in a double boiler over low heat. Beat
  with a wire whisk until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove the top of
  the double boiler and cool in a bowl of cold water while you continue to
  stir; then add the sherry and rosewater. Remove the bowl from the cold
  water. Cut the butter into 1-inch cubes and mash it into the mixture piece
  by piece. Add the orange peel. Whip 3/4 of the cream and fold it into the
  mixture. Pour the mixture into the four orange shells and refrigerate for
  at least 2 hours. Before serving, place three crystallized violets on the
  top of each orange; whip the remaining cream and force it through a pastry
  tube in a curly pattern around the top edges. SERVES:4

      Title: Butterkuchen (Butter Cake)
 Categories: Cakes, German
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2    Env active dry yeast                     Grated rind of 1 lemon
    1/2 c  Water, warm                         3 ea Eggs
    3/4 c  Milk                                     ----Butter Topping----
    1/2 c  Sugar                             1/2 c  Butter (1 stick)
      1 ts Salt                                1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter                            1/2 ts Cinnamon
      4 c  All-purpose flour, sifted         1/3 c  Almonds, blanched, slivered
 
  Sprinkle the yeast over warm water. Heat milk, sugar, salt and the 1/2 cup
  butter together until sugar is dissolved and butter melted. Cool to
  lukewarm. Add dissolved yeast. Place the flour blended with lemon rind in
  large mixing bowl; form a well in the center. Add yeast-milk mixture and
  the eggs. Stir until blended and smooth. Pour into a buttered 9x13-inch
  baking pan, spreading dough evenly. Let rise in warm place about 45
  minutes.
  
  Chop the butter into the mixed sugar and cinnamon to form fine particles.
  Sprinkle over top of risen batter. Add the almonds. Bake in oven preheated
  to 375 F. for 30 minutes, or until top is golden and syrupy. Makes about 12
  servings.
  
  Variations: Streuselkuchen: This is much the same as Butterkuchen except
  that the lemon rind is omitted from the butter and a crumb topping of 1 1/2
  cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup ground almonds and 8 Tbsp (1 stick)
  butter are sprinkled over batter. If desired, 1/4 tsp cinnamon may also be
  added to the topping mixture.
  
  Apfebutterkuchen (a Bremen specialty). Prepare as for Butterkuchen, place
  sliced peeled apples over top of dough before placing in oven. Cover apples
  with same Butter Topping. Almonds are an optional addition (and very
  good!).

      Title: Byzantine Dolmathes (Stuffed Grapeleaves)
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers
      Yield: 60 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1    Jar grapeleaves (or fresh)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 tb Oil                               1/2 ts Salt
      1 lb Ground beef or lamb                      Pepper to taste
      2    Onions; chopped                   1/8 ts Cinnamon
      1    Garlic clove; pressed             1/2 c  Currants
      2 c  Water                             1/4 c  Port wine (optional)
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce                      1/4 c  Pine nuts or walnuts
      1 c  Rice                                2 c  Water
      2 tb Chopped mint                        1    Lemon (juice only)
      2 tb Chopped parsley               

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      3    Eggs                                1 c  Hot broth
      2    Lemons (stained juice only)    
 
  If using canned grape leaves, rinse off brine by floating leaves in a basin
  of cold water.  Prepare fresh vine leaves by pouring a cup of boiling water
  over them in a bowl.  Drain.  Spread 5 or 6 leaves out at a time on a flat
  surface.  Lay leaf stem side up.  Snip off stem with kitchen shears.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Heat oil in large frying pan.  Fry meat, onions and garlic
  on medium heat for 5 minutes, mixing it as it cooks.  Add water and
  remaining ingredients.  Bring to a boil.  Cover.  Reduce heat to simmer and
  cook 10 minutes, until water is absorbed.  Set aside until cool enough to
  handle.  Put 1 teaspoon of filling near stem.  Bring left side of leaf
  towards center, then bring right side towards center.  They will not always
  meet.  Pick up stem end of leaf, tucking in the filling.  Roll away from
  you.  It will be an oblong roll like a sausage.
  
  Line the bottom of a large skillet with 4 leaves.  Place each roll so that
  the tucked under end is on the bottom.  Arrange each roll snugly, one next
  to the other, until all the leaves (except 3), and filling are gone. Place
  these leaves flat on top of rolls.  Place a flat dish on top of rolls also
  to prevent their unravelling during cooking.
  
  Add water and lemon juice.  Bring to a boil.  Cover.  Reduce heat to simmer
  and cook 45 minutes.  When done, remove pot from fire.  Make Egg and Lemon
  Sauce and add to broth immediately or serve without sauce either cold as an
  appetizer or as a hot entree.
  
  EGG AND LEMON SAUCE: Beat eggs until thick and light yellow, at least 5
  minutes, with an electric beater or 10 to 15 minutes by hand.  Add juice
  slowly, beating all the while.  Mix 1 cup hot broth into beaten eggs,
  stirring it in quickly with spoon (or wire whisk) so heat will not curdle
  the eggs.  Cook over very low heat until thickened.

      1 md Onion, Diced                        2 qt Tomato Juice
      1    Green Pepper, Diced            
 
  PREPARE THE CABBAGE LEAVES: The Old timers would freeze the head solid,
  then peel the leaves from the head as they thawed. The best way I've found
  is to 1)cut the core out with a knife, then put the hole-where-the-core-
  was, side down in a steamer over boiling water. Let it sit for about 10
  minutes and remove. Several layers of the outer leaves should be soft
  enough to remove from the head. When you've removed as many as you can,
  return the head to the steamer to soften more leaves. Take a sharp knife
  and remove as much of the central vein as you can. FILLING: Mix all the
  other ingredients together in a bowl. work it with your hands until the
  eggs and other ingredients except the tomato juice are thoroughly mixed
  into the meat. Now, take a glob of mixture and set it in the hollow of a
  deveined leaf,with the end that was near the core towards you. Fold the end
  nearest you about / way over the mix. Fold the left side over the mix and
  then the right side. Roll about / turn away from you so that the "seam" is
  on the bottom. Place in the pan seam side don and continue with the other
  leaves.* When you've made the last cabbage roll,pour in the tomato juice to
  cover. Bring to a boil then simmer for AT LEAST an hour. Serve in a bowl
  with the juice, although these, like spaghetti are better the 2nd day.
  
  *This is an ideal cabbage roll. 3/4 of them won't go together this
  perfectly, so be ready to make adjustments when making the rolls.
  
  VARIATIONS: Garlic is great, paprika and chili powder will work in the
  stuffing, V-8 instead of tomato juice is pleasantly different.

  guess, some other sort of berries, or possibly morellos. K.B.))

      Title: Calamaria Gemista (Stuffed Squid)
 Categories: Fish/sea, Greek
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    3/4 c  Dry white or red wine
      3 lb Large fresh squid                        Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 c  Olive oil                                -to taste
      1 c  Coarsely chopped onion            3/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
           -(packed)                                -(packed)
    1/3 c  Long-grain rice                   1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill, packed
    1/4 c  Pine nuts                           4 tb Chopped fresh mint
      2 lg Garlic cloves; chopped              2 c  Peeled, seeded tomatoes
    1/4 c  Currants                                 -(chopped)
 
  Wash and clean squid.  Grasp the head just below the eyes, pull it off from
  the rest of the body, and set it aside.  Cut away the thin purplish
  membrane on the outside of the tail section.  Using your index finger,
  scoop out and discard the guts and thin cartilage "icicle" on the inside of
  the tail section.  Rinse tail sections inside and out and set aside in a
  colander to drain.  Take the head section in one hand and put pressure with
  your thumb and forefinger around the mouth and eyes, to squeeze them out.
  Discard mouth and eyes.
  
  Chop the squid tentacles and have them ready, as they will be used in the
  stuffing.
  
  In a large skillet, heat half the oilve oil and saute onion until wilted.
  Add rice, tentacles, and pine nuts and saute over medium-low heat for 2 to
  3 minutes.  Add garlic and currants to rice and stir quickly with a woodent
  spoon.  Pour in 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup water.  Season with salt and
  pepper.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until liquid is almost
  completely absorbed and rice is soft but only about half cooked, about 15
  minutes.  About 5 minutes before removing skillet from heat, add parsley,
  dill and mint.  Remove and let cool enough to handle.
  
  Using a small teaspoon or a butter knife, carefully fill about three
  quarters of each squid with the rice mixture.  Use toothpicks to secure
  closed.  Pour remaining olive oil into a large stewing pot.  Place squid
  carefully in pot.  Pour in remaining wine and enough water to cover. Bring
  to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered for about 1-1/2 hours,
  or until rice is cooked and squid fork-tender.  Twenty minutes before
  removing squid from heat, add chopped tomatoes to pot and adjust seasoning
  with salt and pepper.  Check throughout cooking to see if more water is
  necessary so that mixture doesn't dry out.  Serve squid hot or cold with a
  simple green salad.
  
  SERVING SUGGESTIONS: This dish needs a delicate wine such as a Robola
  Callinga or Santorini Boutari.  Serve with wild greens (horta), 'horiatiki
  salata (village salad), and a beautiful olive bread.

      Title: Cannoli
 Categories: Italian, Desserts
      Yield: 16 servings
 
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Whole-milk ricotta cheese;      1 1/2 c  Milk chocolate;
           - well drained                           - coarsely chopped
      3 tb Sugar                             1/4 c  Pistachio nuts;
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon                                 - coarsely chopped

-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      1 c  All-purpose flour                        - or dry white wine
      1 tb Sugar                               2 c  Vegetable oil
      1 tb Butter or lard                           Colored sprinkles
      4 tb To 5 Tbl sweet Marsala wine              Confectioners' sugar
 
  In a bowl, combine all the filling ingredients and mix well. Refreigerate,
  covered, until ready to fill the cannoli shells.
  
  To make the dough, place the flour in a bowl or food processor. Add the
  butter or lard and sugar and mix with a fork, or pulse, until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal. Slowly add the 1/4 cup of wine and shape the mixture
  into a ball; add a little more wine if the dough appears too dry. It should
  be soft but not sticky. Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth,
  about 10 minutes.  Wrap the dough and refrigerate for 45 minutes.
  
  Place the chilled dough on a floured work surface. Divide the dough in
  half.  Work with 1 piece of dough at a time; keep the remaining dough
  refrigerated. Roll the dough out to a very thin long rectangle about 14
  inches long and 3 inches wide, either by hand or using a pasta machine set
  to the finest setting.  Cut the dough into 3-inch squares. Place a cannoli
  form diagnoally across 1 square. Roll the dough up around the form so the
  points meet in the center.  Seal the points with a little water. Continue
  making cylinders until all the dough is used.
  
  In an electric skillet, heat the vegetable oil to 375F. Fry the cannoli 3
  or 4 at a time, turning them as they brown and blister, until golden brown
  on all sides. Drain them on brown paper. When they are cool enough to
  handle, carefully slide the cannoli off the forms.
  
  To serve, use a long iced tea spoon or a pastry bag without a tip to fill
  the cannoli with the ricotta cheese mixture. Dip the ends into colored
  sprinkles, arrange them on a tray, and sprinkle confectioner's sugar over
  the tops.  Serve at once.
  
  NOTE:  If you prefer, you can fry the cannoli in a deep fryer. Be sure to
  fill the cannoli just before serving - any sooner will make the shells
  soggy.

  remove from the pot and set aside. Brown the lamb. Remove and set aside.
  Preheat oven to 300F. Pour off and discard most of the fat, leaving just
  about 3 tablespoons in the pot. Lower heat to medium and add the onions.
  Cook, stirring, until onions soften, about 7 minutes. Add drained beans,
  bacon, garlic and herbs and replace the duck, pork and lamb. Add 4 cups
  water, cover and place in the oven for 2 hours. Add the sausages and salt
  as desired. Replace in the oven another hour. Remove herbs in cheesecloth.
  When it's time to serve dinner, place the casserole on the table.

      Title: Cauliflower Soup (Minestra Di Cavalfiore)
 Categories: Italian, Soups/stews, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lg Head cauliflower                    3 c  Hot meat broth
      2 tb White or cider vinegar                   Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil                         1/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      4    To 6 cloves garlic                  6 oz Freshly grated pecorino
    1/4 ts To 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes             -cheese
 
  "There's probably no sense in making this soup if you don't like
  cauliflower.  As with so much Italian food, this recipe uses a few basic
  ingredients to showcase the star vegetable.  A purist would even shudder at
  the cheese!  Make this soup as garlicky and spicy as you like but be sure
  to serve lots of crusty Italian bread or bruschetta (toasted Italian bread
  brushed with olive oil).  When I want a soup with a bit more texture, I
  remove 1 cup of the cooked cauliflower, puree it, and return it to the
  remaining soup"
  
  Break the cauliflower florets into small (1/2 inch) pieces.  Trim the stem
  end and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.  Wash the cauliflower in 2 quarts of cold
  water blended with 2 tablespoons of vinegar.  Drain and drop into a large
  pot of boiling salted water.  Boil for 4 minutes; drain and dry well.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a soup pot; add the garlic and hot pepper, and cook
  gently until the garlic is golden.  Add the cauliflower and cook for 5
  minutes, stirring to prevent it from browning.  Add the hot broth, salt and
  parsley and cook until the cauliflower is tender.  Ladle into soup bowls
  and sprinkle with a generous amount of cheese.
  
  Serves 6.

      Title: Celery Root Salad (Selleriesalat)
 Categories: Salads, German
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 md Celery root (3-inch                      Wine vinegar
           -diameter), peeled,                      Salt
           Washed, and thinly sliced           1 pn Sugar
      1 c  Beef stock                          1 sm Onion, finely chopped
      2 tb To 3 tb salad oil              
 
  Put the freshly sliced celery root immediately into the stock which should
  be flavored with 1 tablespoon each oil and vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the
  sugar, and the chopped onion.  Cook for about 20 minutes - until the celery
  root is quite tender and the liquid has almost boiled away.  Season the
  celery root and beef stock with the remaining oil and a dash or two of wine
  vinegar, as well as with salt if you wish.
  
  Note:  If the salad is to be served as an appetizer, mix in some coarsely
  chopped walnut and garnish with a few walnut halves.
  
  Nowadays, in this age of crudites, it may be more usual to substitute
  grated uncooked celery root, marinated in oil and vinegar, and possibly
  mixed with grated raw carrot.
  
  Makes 2 - 3 cups.

      6 oz Feta cheese, crumbled               1 tb Chopped fresh dill, or 1 tsp
      4 oz Creamed cheese                           -dried
      1    Egg, beaten                         8    Sheets packaged phyllo dough
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley             1/2 c  Butter
 
  Throughout the Middle East, bureks are made by folding buttered,
  cheese-filled phyllo dough into little triangular shapes.  Cigarro bureks
  taste the same but, as the name implies, are rolled into cylindrical shapes
  resembling small cigars.  Bureks, frozen unbaked, can go directly from the
  freezer into a preheated 375 F oven to make an instant hors d'oeuvre.
  
  Makes 40
  
  Defrost the phyllo dough and return the remainder to the freezer.  Butter a
  cookie sheet.  Melt the butter and remove from the heat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F.
  
  Mix the feta and cream cheese with the egg and herbs and set aside.
  
  Layout one sheet of phyllo dough on a counter.  (Keep the remaining dough
  covered with a slightly damp towel to prevent its drying out.)  Brush the
  sheet of dough with some melted butter.  Cut it the short way into 5
  strips, about 3x10 inches each.  Place 1 1/2 teaspoons of the filling at
  one end of each strip.  Roll the strips into cylinders about 1/2 inch in
  diameter.  Continue until all of the dough has been cut, filled, and
  rolled.
  
  Arrange 2 to 3 cylinder per person on the cookie sheet and brush them with
  more butter.  (Freeze the rest of the cylinders, unbaked, for use at
  another time.)  Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the cylinders are well
  browned and very flaky.

  "While Schwartz describes the name for this Israeli dish as slightly
  pretentious, he notes that it won a cooking competition and found its way
  onto the menus of five star hotels. He recommends serving it over a bed or
  bulgur pilaf."
  
  In large glass bow, combine chicken parts, orange juice, wine, zest, salt,
  paprika and pepper. Let marinate in fridge for 2 hours. Lift chicken out of
  marinade; pat dry and reserve chicken & marinate separately. In deep heavy
  skillet or shallow pan large enough to hold chicken in one layer; heat oil
  over medium-high heat. Brown chicken on all sides; transfer to plate. In
  the same pan, cook onion over low heat until it starts to change colour.
  Pour in marinade and simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  Return chicken to pan and simmer, partially covered, basting the chicken
  with pan juices and turning the pieces over very low heat for about 35
  minutes; or until chicken juices run clear when flesh is pierced with a
  sharp knife. Transfer chicken to warm serving platter and keep warm. Skim
  off excess fat. Add olives to pan and boil rapidly over high heat until
  glossy and starting to thicken. Pour over chicken and sprinkle with meat.

      Title: Chilau
 Categories: Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    500 g  Rice, basmati                       4 tb Butter
      4 tb Salt                           
 
  Wash the rice well in a colander then put it in a bowl with 2 tb salt and
  lukewarm water to cover. Stir and let it soak overnight if you can, or at
  least for 1 hour. The longer the better.
  
  Fill a large saucepan with plenty of water, add 2 tb salt and bring to the
  boil. Sprinkle the drained rice in gradually and let it boil vigourly for
  about 4 to 8 minutes. The time depends upon the batch of rice but is ready
  when if you bit on a grain of rice you consider it to be slightly
  underdone, slightly harder than you would like to eat it. Drain quickly and
  rinse in lukewarm water.
  
  Put 2 tb butter and let it melt in the bottom of a pan, add all the rice
  and stir. Cover with 2 more tb of butter. Stretch a clean cloth over the
  top of the pan, put  the lid on the top and lift the corners of the cloth
  up over it.
  
  Leave the rice to steam for 20 to 30 minutes over a very low flame. It
  should be cooked and separate. The crisp, brown, golden crust that forms at
  the bottom is considered a delicacy to be offered firs to guest. It is
  called 'dig'. Remove it with a spatula and serve separately.

      Title: Chocolate Toffee (Scotland)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies, Ethnic
      Yield: 64 servings
 
      1 c  Sugar                                    -unsweetened chocolate,
    2/3 c  Light corn syrup                         -melted
  1 1/2 c  Half-and-half                   1 1/2 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2    Squares (1 oz each)                 1 pn Salt
 
  You should never try to make toffee (or any other cooked candy, for that
  matter) in damp weather, because the candy will not harden properly.
  
  Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and 1/2 cup of cream in a large saucepan set
  over moderate heat. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves completely.
  Insert a candy thermometer, reduce the heat to low, and cook the syrup,
  stirring frequently, until the thermometer registers 238F. Blend in another
  1/2 cup of the cream, which will cause the temperature to drop, and
  continue to cook and stir until the thermometer reaches 236 F or until a
  bit of the hot toffee dropped into a little cold water forms a soft,
  pliable ball. Mix in the remaining 1/2 cup cream and the melted chocolate.
  Cook the toffee, stirring constantly lest it scorch. Cook toffee until the
  mixture becomes quite thick: A drop of it should firm up quickly in cold
  water. (NOTE: Even though the temperature of the toffee may not exceed
  230F, if it firms in cold water, remove the pan from the heat at once.)
  Quickly mix in the vanilla and salt, then pour the toffee into a
  well-buttered 8-by-8-by-2-inch pan. Cool the toffee completely, then cut it
  into 1-inch squares. Wrap each one in waxed paper or plastic wrap. Makes 64
  candies.

      1 tb Freshly ground anise                1 c  Golden raisins
      1 tb Freshly ground coriander            1 c  Olive oil, mild

-------------------------------STARTER DOUGH-------------------------------
      4 pk Active dry yeast                         - temperature
    1/2 ts Sugar                               4 c  All-purpose flour;
    1/2 c  -Hot water, just above body              -plus extra for kneading
 
  Make the flavoring addition first.  Combine the semolina flour, sugar,
  cinnamon, anise, coriander, and cloves in a bowl and add the finely grated
  zests of the oranges and tangerines.  Squeeze some of the oranges and
  tangerines.  Squeeze some of the oranges and tangerines to obtain 1 1/4
  cups juice.  Use half this juice to soak the currants and raisins for a
  minimum of 1 hour, preferably overnight.  Put the remaining juice in a pan
  with the olive oil.  Heat until almost boiling.  Pour this into a bowl with
  the semolina and spice mixture and stir.  Cover and leave overnight until
  needed.
  
  Next day, combine the dried yeast with the sugar and hot water in a cup.
  Put the flour in a bowl, making a well in the center.  Pour in the yeast
  mixture.  Squeeze 2/3 cup more orange and tangerine juice, warm it, nad
  add.  Work to a smooth dough, adding more water and warm juice if
  necessary.  Put the dough into an oiled bowl, cover with a cloth, and leave
  to rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size - about an hour.
  
  Punch down the dough in a bowl.  Combine the drained currants and raisins
  with the semolina and spice mixture and, working with your hands, combine
  with the dough.  Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 10
  minutes, adding more flour if the dough is sticky.
  
  Divide the dough into three equal pieces.  Oil 3 loaf pans, each 1-1/2
  quart capacity.  Shape each piece to fit the length of the pan and fit them
  in, so the corners are well filled.  Cover with a cloth and leave to rise
  in a warm place until almost double in size - another hour.
  
  Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F for 1 hour and 10 minutes or more; the
  loaves should be rich brown color and make a hollow sound when the unmolded

      Title: Corned Tongue
 Categories: Beef, Jewish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Tongue, beef                      1/2 ts Allspice, whole; bruised
           Water, as needed                  1/2 ts Peppercorns; bruised
      1    Salt, kosher; as needed             2 ts Coriander seeds; bruised
      1    Egg, in shell                       1 ts Mustard seeds; bruised
    1/2 c  Sugar, brown, dark                  2    Garlic clove; peeled
      2    Bay leaf; crumbled             
 
  Select a ceramic, glass or enameled crock or bowl large enough to hold both
  the tongue and enough brine to cover the tongue by two or more inches. Be
  sure the container will fit in the refrigerator. To determine the brine
  quantity needed, enclose the tongue in a plastic bag and run cold water
  into the container to cover the bagged meat by two to three inches. Remove
  the tongue. Stir kosher salt gradually into the water, dissolving
  thoroughly each time, until an egg will float in it. (This will run about a
  cup and a half of salt.) Remove the egg once it's served its purpose and
  pour the brine into a pot. Stir all the other ingredients into the brine
  and bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Let brine cool
  completely. Remove the tongue from the plastic bag and prick it well all
  over with a skewer or larding needle. Return to the crock. Once the brine
  has cooled, pour it over the tongue.  Cover with Saran, then add a plate
  (weighted, if need be) to keep the meat well under the surface. Cover the
  whole crock with Saran and refrigerate for 10 days to 2 1/2 weeks (allow
  three days a pound curing time).  Turn the meat every few days, and be sure
  to keep it always sunk in the brine. To cook: Put the tongue in a pot with
  water to cover by several inches, two or three carrots coarsely chopped, a
  whole onion or two (peeled), a few tablespoons of vinegar, and simmer,
  partly covered, until the meat is very tender. Remove from the stock, and
  slit the skin and peel it away. Serve hot or cold.

 Categories: Londontowne
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Flour                                    FILLING:
      1 pn Salt                                8    Ox cubed beef stew meat
      1 c  Lard                                2 md Potatoes peeled & diced
      1 c  Cold water approximately            1 lg Finely chopped onion
 
  Pastry:
  
  Salt and pepper to taste Approximately 2 teaspoon cornstarch
  
  PASTRY:
  
  Combine flour and salt in a large bowl and cut in lard until mixture
  resembles fine bread crumbs. Add water slowly, a little at a time, until
  mixture binds into a soft dough. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate
  at least an hour, a day or two is even better. There will be pastry left
  over which can be frozen, or make a pie while the oven is on for the
  pasties.
  
  FILLING:
  
  Mix together half the beef, half the onion, and one potato for each
  filling. Season to taste with salt and pepper and sprinkle mixture with 1
  teaspoon of the cornstarch. When ready to make pasties, remove pastry from
  the refrigerator and prepare filling. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Roll out
  pastry as for pie crust and cut out two large circles 10 inches in
  diameter. Place filling in center. Brush edges of pastry with water and
  fold one half of circle over to meet the other, creating a half-moon shape.
  Press edges of pastry together lightly. Turn edges over about half an inch
  and crimp so it won't open during baking. Make two half-inch slits near the
  top of each pastry and place on a piece of baking parchment on a baking
  sheet. Brush the pasties with milk and bake 15-20 minutes. Reduce heat to
  375 degrees for about another 45 minutes, or until pasties are golden
  brown.

  NOODLES:
  
  Dough: First mix flour with the salt. Combine the egg, milk and cottage
  cheese in blender.  Stir combination into the flour and salt and knead to
  make a soft dough. Cover and let the dough stand for 10 minutes.
  
  Filling: In a bowl, combine the cottage cheese with the egg, and season to
  taste with salt. The filling should be thick enough to hold its shape in a
  spoon.
  
  Roll the dough quite thin on a floured board. Cut rounds with a large
  biscuit cutter or with the rim of a glass. For speedier work, the dough may
  be cut into 2 - 2 1/2 inch squares. Put a round or square of dough on the
  palm of your hand. Place a spoonful of the cheese filling on the dough,
  fold it over to form a half circle or triangle, and press the edges
  together with your fingers. The edges should be free of filling. Be sure
  that the edges are sealed well to prevent the filling from running out.
  Place the vareniki on a floured board or a kitchen towel (don't crowd
  them), and cover with a kitchen towel to prevent drying.
  
  Drop a few vareniki at a time into a large quantity of rapidly boiling
  salted (optional) water. Do not attempt to cook too many at a time.
  
  Stir very gently with a wooden spoon to separate the vareniki and to
  prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Continue boiling for 3
  4 minutes. Vareniki are ready when they are well puffed. Remove them to a
  colander and drain thoroughly. Place in a deep dish, sprinkle generously
  with melted butter, and toss very gently to coat them evenly with butter.
  Serve in a large dish without piling or crowding them. Top with bread
  crumbs. The traditional accompaniment is sour cream or crumbled bacon, or
  both.
  
  An additional egg or egg yolk, or some thick sour cream, may be used in the
  filling if the cottage cheese is very dry.

      3 tb Fresh lemon juice                   3 sm Turnips
    1/2 c  Ripe tomatoes                       2 c  Couscous
    1/2 ts Cinnamon                            3 sm Zucchini
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg               2    Italian sweet peppers
 
  1.  Soak the chickpeas overnight in four times their volume of water in a
  noncorrisble bowl.
  
  2.  Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed 5- to 7-quart pot.
  
  3.  Cut the lamb into 1-inch cubes.  Brown them (in batches, if necessary)
  on all sides over moderate heat.  Transfer the meat to a warm platter.
  
  4.  Reduce the temperature to low and saute the onions for 2 minutes,
  stirring frequently.
  
  5.  Add the lamb, boiling water, lemon juice, tomatoes, cinnamon, nutmeg,
  bay leaf, mint, salt, and pepper.  Stir, cover, and simmer the mixture vfor
  20 minutes.
  
  6.  Drain the chickpeas and stir them into the lamb mixture. Simmer the
  ingredients, covered, for 45 minutes.
  
  7.  Begin this step 5 minutes before step 6 is completed. Peel the carrots
  and turnips.  Cut the carrots into 3/4-inch long segments and the turnips
  into 3/4-inch cubes.  When step 6 is completed, stir these ingredients into
  the pot containing the lamb.  Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.
  
  8.  Begin this step as soon as the carrots and turnips start simmering in
  step 7.  Put the couscous pellets in a 2- to 3-quart pan.  Pour cold tap
  water into the pan until it reaches a depth of 1 inch above the pellets.
  Soak the pellets for 10 minutes.
  
  9.  Pour the couscous into a sieve, discarding the water. Return the
  couscous to its soaking pan.  Slowly strain two cups of the broth from the
  large pot into the couscous.  Bring this mixture to a simmer. Cover, and
  cook for 5 minutes over low heat.
  
  10.  Slice the zucchini into 3-inch cuves and the peppers into 1/4
  inch-thick rings.  When step 7 is completed, stir in both ingredients and
  simmer the mixture, covered, for 10 minutes.
  
  11.  It should be time to turn off the heat under the simmering couscous
  pellets as soon as the zucchini-and-pepper mixture starts simmering in step
  10.  Fluff the pellets, cover the pan, and let it stand for 8 minutes. Then
  pour off any remaining liquid.
  
  12.  Mound the couscous pellets in the center of a warm, large serving
  platter.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat and vegetables from the
  pot and neatly arrange them around the mound.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

  CRAWFISH STUFFED MANICOTTI: Melt the 4 tablespoons butter. Fry the green
  onions, parsley and garlic until onions are wilted. Add the crawfish tails
  and let all of this fry until sizzling hot. Heat a small pot and pour in
  the brandy. Remove the crawfish from fire, ignite the brandy and pour into
  the crawfish mixture. Toss until flames die down. Set aside.
  
  In another pot, melt 8 tablespoons butter.  Add the flour and let this cook
  on a low fire until flour is cooked, about 2 minutes, stirring often. Add
  the cream, milk, ketchup and tomato paste, stirring constantly until sauce
  comes to a boil and starts to thicken.
  
  Add the wine, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and Tabasco.
  
  Combine both pans and simmer for a few minutes.  If sauce is too thick,
  thin it out with a little more milk.
  
  Cook manicotti according to package directions.
  
  Note:  Do not use crawfish cooked with crab boil.
  
  STUFFING: Melt the stick of butter. Fry onions, green onions, celery, green
  pepper, garlic and parsley until wilted.  Add crawfish meat, lemon juice,
  bay leaves and thyme.  Let all of this cook for about 10 or 15 minutes or
  until vegetables are cooked.  Add bread crumbs, salt, pepper and Tabasco.
  
  Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring often.  If stuffing is too moist, add a
  little more bread crumbs.  Add the egg and mix well.
  
  Stuff the manicotti carefully and lay them in a lightly greased baking dish
  in a single layer.
  
  Pour most of the sauce over the manicotti and bake covered in a 350 F
  preheated oven for about 35 to 40 minutes or until manicotti are fully
  cooked.  Spoon reserved sauce over manicotti when served.
  
  Serves 5 to 7.

  Roll out the larger disk of dough 1/8 inch thick on a floured surface, fit
  it into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim, and crimp the edge.
  Chill the shell for 30 minutes.
  
  In a small bowl combine the raisins and the grappa and let the raisins
  macerate for 30 minutes. In a bowl whisk together the eggs, the ricotta,
  the granulated sugar, the vanilla, and the zest, stir in the chocolate and
  the raisin mixture, and pour the filling into the shell.
  
  Roll out the remaining disk of dough 1/8 inch thick on a floured surface,
  cut it into 1/2-inch-wide strips with a fluted pastry wheel, and arrange
  some of the strips, about 1 inch apart, over the filling. (If desired,
  arrange the remaining strips, about 1 inch apart, perpendicular to the
  others, forming a lattice, but do not weave the strips.) Trim all the
  strips, press them against the inside of the shell, and brush them with the
  egg wash. Bake the tart in the middle of a preheated 350 degree oven for 50
  minutes, or until the pastry is golden and a knife inserted in the center
  of the filling comes out clean, and let it cool in the pan on a rack for 10
  minutes. Remove the rim, let the tart cool completely on the rack, and dust
  it with the confectioners' sugar.

  concentric rows, on the baked almond filling. Lace the raspberries here and
  there between the figs and in the center of the tart. Just before serving,
  dust with the confectioners' sugar.

      Title: Crostata Di Fragole
 Categories: Desserts, Italian
      Yield: 10 servings
 
-------------------------PASTA FROLLA ALLE MANDORLE-------------------------

---------------------------SWEET DOUGH W/ALMONDS---------------------------
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour                   1 pn Salt
    1/2 c  Ground blanched almonds             5 tb Cold unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Sugar                               1    Egg

----------------------------FOR THE STRAWBERRIES----------------------------
      3 pt Ripe strawberries                 1/2 c  Strawberry jam
      2 tb Sugar                                    Confectioners' sugar
      1 ts Lemon juice                              - for finishing
 
  Use a sharp knife to cut the crostata to keep the berries from toppling and
  lessening the elegant symmetry of the dessert.
  
  FOR THE PASTA FROLLA: Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix well.
  Rub in the butter until it is absorbed. Make sure the mixture remains cool
  and powdery and does not become pasty. Beat the egg and stir in with a
  fork. Continue stirring until the dough holds together, then knead it
  smooth, briefly. Shape into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate at
  least 1 hour, or until firm.
  
  FOR THE STRAWBERRIES: Rinse and hull berries. Choose the best ones to
  border the tart (draw a 9-inch circle on wax paper and arrange berries
  inside to see how many you need). Slice remaining berries into a bowl; add
  sugar and lemon juice. Toss to combine and cover with plastic wrap.
  Refrigerate the sliced and whole berries until ready to assemble the
  crostata. Preheat oven to 350F and set a rack in the middle level. To form
  tart base, roll three-quarters of the dough on a floured surface to a
  9-inch disk. Transfer to a cookie sheet lined with parchment or buttered
  wax paper. Place a 9-inch disk, like a spring- form bottom, on dough and
  trim to a 9-inch diameter. Pierce the dough all over with a fork at
  1/2-inch intervals. Combine the scraps with the remaining dough and roll it
  into a thin cylinder, about 30-inches long. Moisten the edge of the base
  with water and arrange the cylinder of dough on it, to form sides on the
  tart shell. Press the cylinder with fingertip to make it adhere and mark a
  series of diagonal lines on it with the back of a small knife. Bake about
  25 minutes, until the dough is an even golden color and feels firm when
  pressed with fingertip. Cool the tart shell on a rack on the pan. Place
  cooled shell on a platter. Spread bottom evenly with jam. Arrange a row of
  the whole strawberries inside the edge. Drain sliced berries well; pile in
  center. Dust with sugar.

  SIFT TOGETHER FLOUR, sugar and salt on a wooden pastry board. Make a well
  in the center and add butter, egg yolks and lemon rind. Mix and knead with
  the fingertips taking care not to handle too much. When smooth, shape into
  a ball and chill for about 30 minutes. Roll out lightly in a circle, cut
  edges and keep dough about 1 inch larger than a 8- to 9-inch (diameter)
  fluted flan tin. Butter and flour the pan and fit the pastry into it, again
  trim the edges, prick with fork and flute edges. Place in preheated oven at
  moderate heat for 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  CREAM PASTICCERA: Beat together yolks and sugar until slightly thickened
  and a light lemon color. Beat in flour and vanilla. Over medium heat, bring
  milk just to the boil. Let it cool for a moment, then add it to the egg
  mixture, whisking rapidly. Cook over low heat until the pastry cream
  thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Cool. When cream
  pasticcera is cool, spread evenly on the bottom of the pie. Fill with
  whatever fresh fruits are available, glaze with an apricot jam. Melt
  apricot jam glaze with a little hot water.

      Title: Crusty Persian Rice with Cinnamon and Pistachios
 Categories: Rice/grains, Ethnic
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Basmati rice (18 ounces)          1/4 ts Cinnamon
      2 tb Salt (plus 1/4 teaspoon)          1/2 c  Shelled unsalted pistachios
    1/8 ts Saffron threads                          -(2 1/2 ounces)
      1 sm Orange                            1/2 c  Golden raisins
      6 tb Butter                              2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 ts Sugar                          
 
  Put rice in medium bowl with water to cover.  Drain and repeat procedure 5
  times.  Return rice to the bowl and gently fill the bowl with cold running
  water.  Keep the water running gently into the bowl until the liquid runs
  clear.  Drain, return rice to the bowl with water to cover, and let stand
  for at least 6 hours.  (Can let stand at room temperature overnight.)
  
  Bring 4 quarts of water with 2 tablespoons salt to boil in a soup kettle.
  Keep the water boiling while slowly adding the drained rice. Simmer for 5
  minutes; rinse with cold running water and drain thoroughly. Remove 1 cup
  of rice and stir in the saffron threads; set aside.  Put the plain rice in
  a large bowl.  Peel a 3- by 1-inch strip of zest from the orange and cut
  into 1/8-inch dice.  Bring 1 cup of water to boil in a small saucepan, add
  the zest, and simmer for 2 minutes.  Drain the zest and pat dry. Heat 1
  tablespoon butter in a small skillet and saute the zest for 15 seconds; add
  the sugar and cook for 30 seconds.  Stir in cinnamon, pistachios, raisins,
  and 1/4 teaspoon salt; saute, stirring continuously to coat with
  butter-sugar mixture.  Stir zest mixture into the plain rice.
  
  Melt the remaining butter.  Coat the bottom and sides of a heavy, lidded,
  3-quart saucepan (preferably cast iron) with 1 tablespoon of the melted
  butter mixed with the oil.  Heat the coated pan until hot.  Remove from the
  heat and spread half of the zested rice over the bottom of the pan,
  pressing down well with a spoon.  Cover with a mound of the remaining
  zested rice.  Sprinkle the saffron rice over the top.  Use the handle of a
  wooden spoon to make a hole in the center of the rice deep enough to reach
  the bottom of the pan.  Make 2 or 3 additional holes in the rice to allow
  steam to escape.  Drizzle rice with remaining 4 tablespoons of melted
  butter.  Cook rice for 6 minutes over low heat, uncovered. Wrap lid in a
  linen towel, securing towel ends under or around lid handle. Cover the pot
  with the towel-wrapped lid and steam over low heat for 40 to 60 minutes,
  until a crisp golden crust forms on the bottom of the rice. Remove pan from
  heat and let stand for 10 minutes.
  
  SERVING:  Spoon soft, fluffy rice onto a platter.  Break the bottom crust
  into pieces and arrange around the fluffy rice.  Serve immediately
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: Octopus with Garlic - Polipi Veraci All'aglio
 Categories: Fish/sea, Italian, Garlic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2    Octopus (about 1 1/2 pounds         1    Bay leaf
           -each)                            1/2 ts Cumin seeds
    1/4 c  Olive oil                                Salt
      5    Cloves garlic, crushed              1 sm Green pepper, chopped
 
  rosemary leaves and parsley
  
  Cut out the eyes and mouth of the octopus. Remove the ink sac and internal
  bone. Cut off the tough points in the tentacles. Put each octopus on a
  board and beat them well to break the fibers and make the meat more tender.
  Wash them in running water until they are very white; do not dry but put
  them in an earthen- ware dish and season with oil, flavored with garlic,
  bay leaf and cumin seeds. Cover the dish tightly with a sheet of waxed
  paper or foil tied around the top with string. Put the dish over a very low
  heat between 1 and 2 hours, according to the size of the octopus. When they
  are tender, drain them, season with additional oil, salt, green pepper,
  rosemary leaves and parsley. Serve in a tureen.

  It doesn't make reference to it in the text, but in the pictures of both
  these dishes, it shows one or two largish octopi garnished with reseattes
  of baby octopi tentacles. I imagine you'd do quite well using the 'baby'
  octopi like those I see sold around here in the supermarkets, or even with
  squid.

      Title: Cucidati
 Categories: Cookies, Italian
      Yield: 48 servings
 
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 c  Dried figs                               - chopped
    1/4 c  Yellow raisins                    1/3 c  Apricot preserves
    1/4 c  Currants or dark raisins          1/4 c  Dark rum
    1/4 c  Candied orange peel                 1 ts Instant espresso coffee
    1/4 c  Toasted, sliced almonds           1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 c  Toasted pine nuts                 1/4 ts Ground cloves
      2 oz Bittersweet chocolate         

-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
  3 1/3 c  Flour                              12 tb Lard or butter
      1 c  Sugar                               2    Eggs
      1 ts Baking powder                     1/3 c  Milk

--------------------------EGG WASH FOR ASSEMBLING--------------------------
      1    Egg                                      Confectioners' sugar
      1 pn Salt                           
 
  The name of these filled pastries is Cucidati, which is Sicilian for
  Buccellati, or "little bracelets."
  
  FOR THE FILLING: Stem the figs and quarter them. Place in a bowl and cover
  with boiling water; steep 10 minutes. Drain and chop coarsely in the food
  processor. Combine with remaining ingredients. To prepare in advance, cover
  tightly with plastic wrap and keep at a cool room temperature or in the
  refrigerator up to 3 days.
  
  FOR THE DOUGH: Combine the flour, sugar and baking powder in a bowl and
  stir to mix. Rub in the lard or butter finely, leaving the mixture powdery.
  Beat the eggs and milk to combine in a small bowl and stir into the flour
  mixture to form a dough. Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface
  and knead lightly a few times. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill. Divide
  the dough into 12 pieces and roll each into a cylinder about 12 inches
  long. Flour the surface and the dough lightly and roll it into a rectangle
  about 14 inches long and 3 inches wide. Place a line of the filling down
  the center of each rectangle, using 1/12 of the filling for each piece of
  dough. Bring up the dough around the filling and pinch to seal. Turn the
  filled sausage of dough over so that the seam is on the bottom and cut it
  into 3 1/2- to 4-inch lengths. Using a sharp paring knife or single-edge
  razor blade, make a series of diagonal slashes in the top of each little
  sausage. Pull and twist gently, holding the sausage at each end to open the
  slashes. Transfer the Cucidati as they are formed to paper- lined cookie
  sheets, curving them into wide horseshoe shapes. Make an egg wash by
  beating the egg and salt together with a fork until it is loose. Paint each
  shape with the egg wash. Bake the Cucidati in a preheated 350F oven about
  20 minutes, or until they are a light golden color. Cool, dust with
  confectioners' sugar and store the Cucidati in tins, between layers of wax
  paper.

  Couscous is normally a savory dish found in Morocco. This unusual dessert
  version is the specialty of a small convent in Sicily.
  
  FIRST PREPARE THE PAN for steaming the couscous: For the sealing dough, mix
  the flour and water together in a bowl and scrape onto a floured work
  surface. Knead briefly to form a rough, sticky dough, adding a tablespoon
  or 2 of flour if necessary. Roll into a rope as long as the circumference
  of the bottom pan and apply the dough to the rim of the pan. Add water to
  the pan so that the water is below the bottom of the couscousiere or
  colander and press the couscousiere into place. Bring the water to a boil
  on high heat, until steam is escaping freely through the perforations, then
  lower to a simmer, so that the steam escapes very gently. While the water
  is coming to a boil, prepare the couscous to be cooked: Place the grain in
  a bowl and add the water. Swish the water through the grain with the
  fingers of one hand splayed apart, "raking" through it. Tilt the bowl and
  drain away excess water. Set aside for 5 minutes. Line the couscousiere
  with a dampened napkin or cheesecloth and add the grain. Cover and steam 15
  minutes. While the grain is cooking, prepare the flavoring. Half fill a
  saucepan with water and add the pistachios. Bring to a boil; drain in a
  strainer. Pour the pistachios onto a towel, fold the towel over them and
  rub to loosen skins. Separate pistachios from skins, going over them
  carefully. Combine the freshly blanched pistachios, extract and cinnamon in
  a food processor bowl and process for 2-3 minutes, until very finely ground
  and starting to become pasty. Add the oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, and
  continue processing mixture to a smooth paste, stopping the machine and
  scraping the inside of the bowl 3-or-4 times. Reserve pistachio paste.
  After the couscous has steamed 15 minutes, remove it from the couscousiere
  in the cheesecloth and put it in a large, non-reactive roasting pan. Spread
  it out with a fork and let cool. Combine the salt and water and work it
  into the cooled couscous, raking it through with 1 hand. Add the pistachio
  paste in 3-or-4 additions, working it in by rubbing it and the couscous
  together with the fingertips. Return the water in the bottom pan to a
  simmer, and line the couscousiere again with the dampened cheesecloth. Add
  the seasoned couscous to the couscousiere, cover and steam 15 minutes.
  Remove the couscous to the roasting pan, spread out with a fork, without
  compressing the mixture, and leave uncovered until cool. To finish the
  couscous, bring the sugar and water to a boil, stirring to dissolve all
  sugar granules, and cool the syrup. Work the cooled couscous between the
  palms of the hands again to separate the grains and toss in the syrup in
  5-or-6 additions, fluffing the couscous with a fork. Allow the couscous to
  dry uncovered, several hours, in a cool place, fluffing it with a fork
  occasionally, until all the grains are separate. For advance preparation,
  cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate up to several days. To
  serve, fluff up with a fork so the grains separate well and mound the
  couscous on a platter. Sprinkle the couscous evenly with the grated
  chocolate, then the confectioners' sugar. Decorate with no more than 5-or-6
  pieces of the candied fruit.

      Title: Cuttlefish with Spinach
 Categories: Greek, Fish/sea
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                           Freshly ground black pepper
    750 g  Cuttlefish or squid               750 g  Spinach
    1/3 c  Olive oil                           1 c  Chopped spring onions
           Water                             1/2    Lemon (juice only)
           Salt                           
 
  Cuttlefish (soupies) as distinct from squid (kalamaria) are preferred for
  this dish, though either may be used.  Cleaning cuttlefish can be a rather
  messy business as these marine molluscs have an ink sac from which the
  pigment sepia is obtained.  The sac ruptures easily and is usually ruptured
  by the time you purchase them, so don't be put off by their colour - the
  ink rinses off easily.
  
  Rinse cuttlefish or squid and remove head, attached tentacles and
  intestines; discard intestines.  Pull out cuttle bone or fine transparent
  bone if squid is being prepared.  Pull off fine skin and rinse.  Remove
  eyes and beak from head, leave head attached to tentacles and pull or rub
  off skin from tentacles, or as much skin as will easily come off.
  
  Slice hood or body into strips.  If squid are large, slice head and
  tentacles - cuttlefish tentacles are usually small and these are left
  intact.  Place prepared cuttlefish or squid in pan and set on medium heat.
  Cover and cook for 15 minutes in its own juice.  Add half the oil, just
  enough water to cover, and salt and pepper to taste, cover and simmer
  gently for 45 minutes or until tender.
  
  Meanwhile trim spinach and wash thoroughly.  Drain well and chop leaves and
  stalks coarsely.
  
  Heat remaining oil in a separate pan and gently fry spring onion until
  soft, add spinach and stir over heat until it wilts.  Add spinach mixture
  to cuttlefish or squid with lemon juice and adjust seasonings with salt and
  pepper.  Cover and simmer for further 10-15 minutes.  Serve hot.

      Title: Czechoslovakian Potato Dumplings
 Categories: Vegetables, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      6 md Potatoes                        1 1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg yolk                          1/2    All-purpose flour
 
  These are *not* fluffy dumplings as in chicken and dumplings.  They are a
  "sturdy" potato dumpling served as a side dish to meat, and usually with a
  sweet sauerkraut/carraway/honey dish as the vegetable.
  
                  *                       *                       *
  
  Boil peeled potatoes in small quantity of water.  Drain potatoes
  thoroughly.  Rice potatoes through hand held masher/ricer.  Let potatoes
  cool.  On floured board, gradually add flour working mixture into dough
  with hands.  Shape potato mixture into a long roll and cut into 10 slices.
  Drop dumplings into boiling water and boil gently about 5 minutes.
  
  Drain dumplings on paper towel.  The dumplings are fully cooked after the
  boiling process, but traditionally, Czechoslovakians then melt butter in a
  heavy frying pan, and fry the dumplings until they are lightly browned on
  all sides.

      Title: Dad's Kaluski
 Categories: Ethnic, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Flour                               1 tb Salt
      4 c  Mashed Potatoes                     4    Eggs

--------------------------------ONION SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 lg Onion                                    Salt
      4 tb Butter                                   Pepper
 
  This recipe is approximate.  One of the controlling factors is the amount
  of leftover mashed potatoes you have----- Besides, Dad never did write this
  one down!
  
  KALUSKI:
  
  Blend flour and salt.
  
  Make a well with the flour.  Mix in the eggs, thoroughly, one at a time.
  Add the mashed potatoes.
  
  You should have a dough that is not quite as stiff as a noodle dough. Add a
  little water, if necessary, to thin it out.
  
  Roll the dough into long strands, about 1 inch in diameter.  Cut into
  sections about 1 1/2 inches long.
  
  Gently add to a large pot of boiling water.  Do not add too many, nor add
  them too fast.  You want to keep the water boiling.  They are down when
  they start to float.  Remove the floaters to a bowl, and continue till you
  finish off the dough pieces.
  
  ONION SAUCE:
  
  Melt butter in pan.  Add coarsely sliced/diced onion.  Saute to taste. I
  like them just transparent, Dad liked them browned, almost burnt. Salt and
  pepper, to taste.
  
  SERVE:
  
  You've got a few options, here---
  
     A:  Pour Onion Sauce over the whole batch
     B:  Serve each separately, for the whiners
         who don't like onions.  Plain butter
         works out, just fine.
     C:  As a side dish, they are great with
         meat gravy
  
  LEFTOVERS:
  
  Should you be fortunate to have some left over, just place in the
  refrigerator.  They are ok, cold, but just reheat in a frying pan. They
  heat more evenly if you slice the kaluski into somewhat smaller pieces.

      Title: Dampfnudle (Yeast Dumplings)
 Categories: German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    500 g  Flour (4 1/2 cups less 1            1 ds Salt
           -Tbsp)                            150 g  Butter OR, better yet,
    1/4 l  Milk (1 cup plus 1 Tbsp)                 -clarified butter (2/3 cup)
     40 g  [fresh] yeast (1.4 oz)              1    To 2 eggs
 
  Heat the milk a bit and then dissolve the yeast in it.  Make a well in the
  flour, and pour the yeast mixture into it.  Let rest for 1/2 hour.  Then,
  add the remaining milk and the salt, and knead well.  Vigorously beat the
  dough until it forms bubbles, then cover, and in a warm spot, let rest for
  1 hour.  Cut off fist size pieces, and - on a floured pastry board - let
  these pieces rise one more time, for another 15 minutes.
  
  In a wide pot, melt the fat, and then add warm, salted water to a depth of
  about 3/4 inch.  Add the dumplings, arranged in one layer, touching each
  other.  Put a lid on the pot, and additionally seal the edges - where the
  lid rests on the pot - with damp cloths in order to keep the steam inside.
  Bake at low heat.  The dumplings should be done in about 20 minutes, and
  have the highly desirable 'Schuepet' (hard, brown crust) on the bottom.
  
  'Dampfnudle' may be served sour, with sauerkraut, or sweet, with stewed
  fruit or vanilla sauce.
  
  Variation: DAMPFNUDLE IN DER SCHLEIFERBRUEH* (Steamed Dumplings in Thin
  Gravy):
  
  Prepare as for regular 'Dampfnudle', but prior to arranging them in the
  pot, thoroughly dust the bottom of each dumpling with flour.  During the
  steaming process, the flour and water will form a whitish gravy that is
  called 'Schleiferbrueh'.
  
  [*Note: In the olden days, scissors-and-knife grinders would go from house
  to house, wheeling a little cart with a round, treadle-operated whetstone.
  The bottom of the whetstone would be in a bit of water, which - with the
  treadle turning the stone - would keep the grinding surface wet. As the
  grinder sharpened knives and scissors, a bit of the whetstone would wear
  off, and this somewhat cloudy water was the original application of the
  term 'Schleiferbrueh'. K.B.]
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: Damson Cheese (Zwetschgenmus)
 Categories: German
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      5 lb Plums                               1 c  Water
 
  Pit the damsons and mince them (or put them through the meat grinder or
  puree in the blender or food processor), retaining as much of the juice as
  possible.  Add a little water to the minced damsons and the juice and
  slowly bring to a boil' reduce the fruit pulp over low heat for several
  hours, but do not stir or the damson pulp is quite likely to scorch on the
  bottom.
  
  When the pulp has thickened somewhat, it will have to be stirred -
  continuously - for several hours, until it is literally thick enough that a
  spoon will stand up in it.  It may sputter and bubble during this stage.
  (In former days, it was usual for several families to convene in the
  village washhouse for a cooperatove 'Zwetschgenmus' cooking session, with
  story-telling and other impromptu entertainments to give encouragement to
  the stirrers.)
  
  When the damson cheese has sufficiently thickened, transfer it to stoneware
  crocks and bake in the oven until a dry crust has formed on top.  The
  damson cheese will keep better if a piece of parchment paper that has been
  soaked in rum is placed on top of this crust before the crock is sealed
  with plastic wrap (formerly a piece of linen or parchment was used). A good
  imported product is available on the American market under the name of
  'Pflaumenmus' (pronounced Flaumenmoose).

      Title: Danish Pastry - Dansk Wienerbrod
 Categories: Ethnic, Desserts
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Flour                               1 c  Milk
      1 ts Salt                                1    Egg
    1/4 c  Sugar                           1 1/2 c  Butter
  2 1/4 oz Yeast cakes                    
 
  Sift flour and mix with sugar and salt. Mix yeast with a little cold milk.
  Add this, the rest of the milk and the beaten egg to flour and sugar. Beat
  well until smooth with a wooden spoon.
  
  Roll out the dough on baking board to 1 finger thickness. Spread small
  pieces of butter on 2/3. of the dough. The butter must have same
  consistency as the dough; if it is too soft it melts into the dough. Fold
  together into three layers like folding a napkin, first the part without
  butter. Roll out and fold again. Repeat three or four times.
  
  Leave in cold place 1/2 hour. This is the dough with which many different
  kinds of Danish pastry is made. When pastry is shaped, place on baking
  sheet and leave in cold place to rise for 15-20 min., then brush with egg
  white and bake in a fast oven until golden brown.
  
  Cocks' Combs (Hanekamme). Roll out dough to finger thickness and spread
  with a paste made of equal parts of butter and sugar, then cut into square
  pieces 4" x 4". Place filling across middle and fold over. Press the edges
  firmly together and make 4-5 deep slashes in this side. Let rise, brush
  with egg white and spread with chopped almonds and sugar.
  
  Spandauers. Roll our dough, spread with paste and cut as above. Place
  filling in middle. Fold corners to the center and press down. After baking
  drop 1 teaspoon of jelly in the center and spread with frosting of
  confectioner's sugar and water.
  
  Chocolate Buns (Cremeboller). Roll out dough, spread with paste and cut as
  above. Place filling of vanilla creme in middle, fold corners to center,
  forming dough as a ball and place upside down on baking sheet. After baking
  spread with frosting of con- fectioner's sugar, cocoa and water.
  
  As filling may be used apple sauce, jelly, prunes, vanilla creme or almond
  paste:
  
  Vanilla Creme. Mix 1 egg yolk, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 table- spoon flour and
  3/4 cup milk and cook until thick. Take off, add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
  extract and cool stirring occasionally.
  
  Almond Paste. Cream 1/2 cup butter, add 1/4 lb. ground, blanched almonds
  and 1/2 cup sugar and well until smooth. Another kind of almond paste
  without butter is made of: 1/4 ]b. almonds, 1/2 cup sugar and 3 egg whites.
  Work well together until smooth.

      Title: Dolmas (Greek Stuffed Grape Leaves)
 Categories: Greek, Rice/grains, Appetizers
      Yield: 50 servings
 
      1 c  Long-grain white rice             1/2 c  Pine nuts
      1 c  Plus 3 Tbsp olive oil               1 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 c  Finely chopped yellow onion       1/2 ts Ground allspice
      3    Green onions, including           1/2 ts Salt
           -green tops, finely chopped       1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley               16 oz Jar grape leaves
      2 tb Minced fresh mint              
 
  Servings: makes about 50 dolmas
  
  Several stems of fresh parsley About 3/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
  About 1 cup homemade chicken stock, canned chicken broth, or water, heated
  Additional freshly squeezed lemon juice Grated or minced lemon zest for
  garnish
  
  Wash and drain rice.  Heat 3 Tbsp of the olive oil in a skillet over
  medium-high heat.  Add the yellow onion and saute until soft but not brown,
  about 5 minutes.  Transfer to a mixing bowl and add the drained rice, 1/2
  cup of the remaining olive oil, green onions, parsley, pine nuts, cinnamon,
  allspice, salt, and pepper.  Set aside.
  
  Rinse the grape leaves under running cold water to removes as much brine as
  possible, pat dry, and stack on a plate.  Place 1 leaf at a time, shiny
  side down, on a flat work surface.  Cut off and discard the tough stem end.
  Spoon about 1 Tbsp of the rice mixture in the center near the base of the
  leaf.  Fold the stem end over to cover the filling, fold both side inward
  lengthwise and then tightly roll leaf toward pointed tip end to form a
  compact packet.  Repeat with the remaining leaves and filling.
  
  Pour about 2 Tbsp. of the remaining olive oil in the bottom of a large pot
  and strew with a layer of parsley stems to prevent grape leaves from
  sticking.  Arrange the stuffed leaves, seam side down and almost touching,
  on top of the parsley, making as many layers as necessary.  Drizzle the
  remaining 5 Tbsp olive oil, the lemon juice, and 1/2 cup stock, broth, or
  water over the leaves.  Top with a heat-resistant plate and weight with a
  heavy can to keep leaves from unwinding during cooking.  Cover the pot,
  bring to a gentle boil, reduce the heat to low, and cook until rice is
  tender, about 1 hour.  During cooking, add a little heated liquid as needed
  to keep dolmas moist.  Remove from the heat and cool in the pot.
  
  Sprinkle with lemon juice to taste, garnish with lemon zest, and serve at
  room temperature.

      Title: Domates Yemistes (Stuffed Tomatoes)
 Categories: Greek, Veal
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/2 lb Lean lamb or veal, ground
     12    Firm, ripe tomatoes               1/4 c  Dry white wine
           Salt                              1/4 c  Water
           Granulated sugar                    6 tb Raw long-grain white rice
      3 tb Olive oil or butter                      Tomato juice (if necessary)
      1 md Onion; finely chopped                    Freshly ground pepper
      2    Garlic cloves; chopped              2    Sprigs fresh mint or basil
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley               1 pn Grated nutmeg
 
  Wash the tomatoes, then turn each stem-side down, and with a sharp knife
  carefully cut the end now up to make an opening or "cap" being careful not
  to detach the cap entirely.  With a small spoon, carefully, without
  breaking the outer skin of the tomatoes, scoop the pulp into a bowl. Place
  the tomato shells in a baking-serving dish large enough to support them
  touching.  Sprinkle the inside of the shells with salt and sugar.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the stuffing.  Heat the oil in a heavy skillet and add
  the onions.  Cook over moderate heat until soft and transparent, then add
  the garlic and parsley, and blend.  Add the meat, mashing with a fork, then
  add the wine and water, cover, and simmer for a few minutes.  Add the rice
  and tomato pulp and stir.  (Tomato juice may be added if necessary, since
  the mixture should provide enough liquid for the rice to absorb.) Cover the
  skillet and simmer about 7 minutes, then add salt, pepper, mint or basil,
  and nutmeg.  Taste for seasoning. Remove from heat, and fill the tomatoes
  up about two-thirds of the way with the stuffing and liquid. Cover with
  tomato caps, brush with oil.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) until the
  rice is tender (approximately 50 minutes to 1 hour), basting inside the
  tomatoes with liquid released by them.  Serve warm.
  
  Note: For Tomatoes stuffed with Rice, use 1 1/4 cups raw long-grain white
  rice instead of the meat and rice in the above recipe, eliminate the wine,
  and include with the other seasonings a few tablespoons each of black
  raisins and 2 tablespoons pine nuts, if desired.  Rice in baked stuffed
  dishes takes much longer to cook then over a burner.  Stuffed green
  peppers, also popular in Greece, can be made the same way with an entirely
  different flavor.

  Calories     per serving: 550 Fat grams per serving: 36 Approx. Cook Time:
  2:00 Peel the onion and slice into thin rings. Wash beef, drain it well,
  and put in an earthenware bowl with the onion, peppercorns, cloves, bay
  leaf, vinegar, and 1-1/3 cups water. Cover the bowl and allow the meat to
  marinate in a cool place for 4 to 6 days. Turn the meat twice daily, adding
  additional vinegar and water as needed to keep the meat covered. Once the
  marinating is complete, remove the meat and dry it. In a pot, heat the
  shortening.  Brown the meat on all sides and salt it to taste. Carefully
  add 1 cup hot water from the side of the pot and crumbled ginger snaps.
  Leave the pot to simmer gently with the lid on.  Turn the meat from time to
  time, adding water if necessary.  The will be about 1 1/2 hours. When the
  meat is ready, serve it with  the gravy in which it has been cooked
  thickened with a bit of corn starch if necessary. This is very good with
  dumplings. 

      Title: Dr. Oetker's Rouladen
 Categories: Beef, German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8    Beef, thin slices                 1/2 c  Onion; diced
      1 ts Cornstarch                          1 tb Lemon juice
           Mustard, prepared                   8 tb Oil
      1 ts Paprika                                  Sour cream; (optional)
      4 oz Bacon, uncooked; diced              1 c  ;Water, boiling
      1 c  Tomato puree                             Creme fraiche; (optional)
 
  Cut thin slices of roasting beef to around 4 x 6 inches off a roast. It is
  best to cut the meat WITH the grain of the meat, so the slices will hold
  together. Pound the slices lightly to flatten and tenderize them. Brush
  lightly with prepared mustard. Then sprinkle the slices with salt and
  freshly ground black pepper to taste.  In a small bowl mix together the
  diced bacon and diced onions.  Spread the mixture on the meat slices. Then,
  starting at the narrow end, roll up the meat slices and secure them with
  skewers, toothpicks, or string.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pot.  Brown the rolls well in the oil.  Add about 1
  cup of boiling water to the pot VERY CAREFULLY! Cover the meat and braise
  gently until done, about 2 to 2-1/2 hours.  Add water as needed to keep
  level fairly constant.  When the meat is cooked, remove the rolls to a hot
  plate and thicken the gravy with corn starch and season to taste. The sauce
  may be seasoned with paprika, tomato puree, lemon juice, sour cream, and/or
  creme fraiche.
  
  Serve this with a potato or pasta dish.

      Title: Dry Salt Cure for a 14-Lb Ham
 Categories: Pork/ham, Londontowne
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Ham (English hams weigh           1/2 oz Saltpeter (from the
           -roughly 14 to 20 lbs)                   -drugstore)
      1 oz Brown sugar                         2 lb Rough salt
 
  The same method may be used for bacon.  A leg of pork severed from the
  whole side is called a ham.  When the leg is left attached to the side, and
  severed only after the cure, it is called a gammon.
  
  You will need a salting pan.  Leave the ham unskinned.  Rub in the sugar
  and the saltpeter first, paying particular attention to the bone ends. Then
  rub on half the salt and put the ham to rest on slats in a slating trough
  (best if it has a channel for the brine to drain out).  Rub in the rest of
  the salt at the end of a week.  Leave the ham to take the salt for a total
  of 3 weeks (depending on the size of the ham), turning regularly. Then hang
  the ham to dry in a draft of warm air for a day or two.  If you would like
  to smoke your own, you will need a barrel smoker or a smoking shed. Light
  the fire with kindling first, then feed it with beech, birch, or oak
  sawdust.  Smoke over the open end of a smoker barrel.  Keep the fire
  smoldering constantly - it is not good for the cure to allow changes in
  temperature.
  
  Twenty-four hours in the smoke shoudl suffice for a ham; 6 hours is enough
  for a side of bacon.  York hams are then hung to mature for 2 to 3 months
  in a tgemperature and humidity controlled room.
  
  Time:  3 weeks plus.

  "My mother used to make this Dutch almond-filled spice cake for special
  occasions and always at Christmas time. When my grandmother, Oma, would
  visit us from Holland, she would expect it with her coffee. Once, when i
  went to Holland, for a visit, my aunt served me some, but it just didn't
  taste as good as the one at Oma's house. I was told my aunt's cake was
  store bought. My mother passed Oma's recipe on to me, and now i carry on
  the tradition."
  
  FILLING: Blend together ground almonds, sugar, 2 Tbsp egg and lemon rind.
  Set aside. CAKE: In a bowl, sift together flour, cinnamon, ground cloves,
  baking powder and nutmeg.; stir in brown sugar. Using a pastry blender or
  two knives, cut in butter until mixture ressembles coarse crumbs. mix in
  milk just until ball forms, adding up to 1 Tbsp more if necessary. On a
  lightly floured surface, knead two or three times or just until dough holds
  together. Divide dough in half. Press half into bottom of 8 inch springform
  pan. With wt fingers, spread filling over dough to within 1/4 inch of

           -use)                          
 
  You are going to cut, bread and fry the eggplant first.
  
  Peel the dark skin off the eggplant. Slice into medium slices slices (about
  1/2 in thick) on the smaller side. Pour Flavored Bread crumbs into a plate
  or into a dish for coating the eggplant patties. . Beat 3 eggs for dipping
  into eggplant. Heat up oil in a large pan, enough to fry the eggplant. Dip
  eggplant into egg and coat it with egg thoroughly. Then coat it with bread
  crumbs. Put them on to a plate when finished till you have enough to fry in
  your frying pan. Place the eggplant in the frying pan if you think it is
  hot enough to fry properly. Keep it frying till both sides are brown. Make
  sure you flip eggplant over so all sides will brown. When finished frying a
  batch place fried patties onto a plate covered with a paper towel to absorb
  the oil. Pre heat the oven to 350~.
  
  After all the frying is done. Coat a pan with some oil (about a 9in square
  by 1 1/2 in deep disposable aluminum pan). Pour a little bit tomato sauce
  on the bottom of the pan. Place a layer of the eggplant patties on top.
  Cover that with sauce and a little bit of mozzerella cheese. Place another
  layer on top of that, repeat. When done put sauce and a lot of cheese at
  the very top add parmesian cheese to the top if desired or available.
  
  Cover the top of pan with foil. Place in the oven for 45 minutes. Stick
  fork in middle to see if it is hot all the way through. If not hot enough
  cook another 10 minutes. Leave it cooking with the foil off the top for the
  last 10 minutes of the cooking.
  
  Let it settle before serving for about 5 minutes. This taste good or better
  reheated. Can be reheated in Microwaveable dish.

  in olive oil until they are dark golden and offer little resistance to a
  fork. Drain on paper towels.
  
  In a 9 x 12 x 3-inch casserole, spoon a thin layer of tomato sauce over the
  bottom. Put down a single layer of fried eggplant slices, followed by a
  generous layer of sauce, mozzarella slices, and a sprinkling of Parmesan.
  Continue repeating process until eggplant and mozzarella are used up
  (you'll probably get two layers of eggplant), ending with a final layer of
  sliced mozzarella on top. Bake in 350 F oven for 40 minutes, making sure
  that cheese on top is melted and browned nicely. You can use the broiler
  for browning during the last few minutes, but don't over do it.

    1/2 c  Olive oil                           6    Anchovy filets
      1    Tomatoes, peeled, seeded                 -finely chopped

      1    Tuna fish, canned;-optional         5    Eggplants, very small or
 
      l lg -Eggplant
  
  1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 2. Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise, if
  using the small ones and take out the flesh, being careful not to damage
  the skin.  Mince the pulp well and place in colander after sprinkling with
  coarse(sea or kosher) salt for 30 minutes. Do the same with the eggplant
  shells and put them on a paper towel to drain. 3. Heat 4 tablespoons of
  olive oil in a large skillet. Add the well drained eggplant pulp and cook
  until lightly browned. 4. Add the tomatoes and cook the mixture over high
  heat until the liquid is evaporated. 5. Add the other ingredients (Note:I
  do not use the tuna fish or the olives if I'm making this as a side
  dish;but they would be necessary if this is to be a main dish entree.) Cook
  the mixture for 2 more minutes. Season with care as the anchovies and
  capers are quite strongly flavored. 6. Fill the eggplant halves with the
  mixture.  there will probably be leftover ingredients to be placed in a
  baking dish. Drizzle the leftover olive oil on top and bake for 1 hour.

      3    Eggs                           
 
  FOR FILLING:     Peel eggplant and slice 1/2-inch thick.  Salt generously
  on both sides.  Drain on paper towels 45 minutes.  Pat dry with paper
  towels. Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes.     Heat oil in heavy large
  skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic and saute until soft, about
  5 minutes.  Add eggplant and saute until beginning to turn golden brown,
  about 15 minutes.  Stir in wine, parsley and basil, scraping up browned
  bits.  Cover and cook until eggplant is tender, about 3 minutes. Season
  with salt and pepper. Transfer to processor or blender and puree until
  smooth. Cool completely. FOR PASTA: Combine flour, eggs and salt in
  processor and mix well.
   With machine running, add just enough water through feed tube to form
  ball.  Remove from processor.  Cover dough and let rest for 30 minutes.
  (Pasta dough can also be made by hand.)     Cut dough into 4 pieces.
  Flatten 1 piece (keep remainder covered), then fold in thirds. Turn pasta
  machine to widest setting and run dough through several times until smooth
  and velvety, folding before each run and dusting with flour if sticky.
  Adjust machine to next narrower setting. Run dough through machine without
  folding. Repeat, narrowing rollers after each run, until pasta is 1/16 to
  1/8-inch thick, dusting with flour as necessary. Line baking sheets with
  towels.  Set sheet of dough on work surface. Place about 1-1/2 teaspoons
  filling at 2-inch intervals along sheet. Roll second piece of dough. Set
  atop first sheet. Press down around filling to force out air and seal
  dough.  Cut into 2-inch squares.  Arrange on prepared sheets.  Repeat with
  remaining dough and filling.  Cover with towel. FOR SAUCE: Combine Madeira,
  wine and shallots in heavy small saucepan. Boil until reduced to 1/4 cup,
  about 4 minutes.  Add cream and peel and boil 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Stir in tomatoes.
   Season with salt and pepper.
      Cook ravioli in large pot of boiling water until just tender but still
  firm to bite, about 4 minutes for fresh.  Remove with slotted spoon; drain.
  Divide among plates.  Spoon sauce over.  Garnish with basil. Serve
  immediately. Serves 6. DO AHEAD HINTS: * Ravioli can be prepared one day
  ahead and refrigerated or one month ahead, wrapped tightly and frozen. Do
  not thaw before cooking. * Sauce can be prepared one day ahead;
  refrigerate. EVEN EASIER: * Purchase sheets of fresh pasta for the ravioli
  or buy prepared ravioli to serve with the tomato cream sauce here. Recipe

  cooking.  Pass the soup through the fine blade of a food mill or puree in a
  food processor and strain.
  
  Put the soup back in the soup pot and correct the seasoning.  Simmer for 10
  minutes.  Ladle into heated soup bowls and pour 1 teaspoon of olive oil
  over each serving.  Garnish with sprigs of fresh marjoram.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

      Title: Farmers Cabbage with Smoked Sausage  (Boerenkool Met Worst)
 Categories: Pork/ham, German, Sausages
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Good sized potatoes                 1 lb Smoked sausage
      1 bn Of kale (to fill a 2 qt.            3 tb Butter or margarine
           -pot)                                    Salt and pepper
 
  Peel, cook, and mash potatoes.  At the same time, chop kale finely, cook
  untill tender. Dice and cook sausage.  Put kale into a blender with enough
  of the cooking water to make a thick slurry.  When done, add to the mashed
  potatoes. Add cooked sausage.  Add butter.  Salt and pepper to taste. Mix
  well and serve piping hot.  For a more festive apprearance, put into a
  cassarole dish, garnish with slices of Oude Gouda (Old Gouda) or a medium
  cheddar and sprinkle with paprika.  Place in medium oven until cheese melts
  and begins to brown.  Then serve or take to your pitch-in.
  
  Don't sell the kohl crops short.  Try collards and savoy.  They are still
  doing quite well in the garden despite 15 F. temperatures lately. Savoy is
  a joy to eat at Yule.  The frost seems to sweeten and intensify the flavor.
  Our annual homemade sauerkraut is making its presence known by the merry
  burbling of the water-seal crocks in the utility room. This is the best
  time of the year to make kraut.  It is cool and the fermentation takes a
  longer time, leaving the salted sour cabbage as crisp as the bright windy
  day in October it was put up.
  
  We are lucky to have antique apple trees.  Three bushels of mixed russets
  are slumbering in the garage and will last until spring.  Fie on the Granny
  Smiths and Red Delicious!  A Golden Russet or Ashmeads Kernel, peeled and
  sliced, served with a wedge of sharp cheddar at your side on a winter
  evening while reading a good book is one of lifes great luxuries.
  
  Rereading this post makes me hungry.  No I'm not going to crack open a
  fruit cake!  They are not ready for another month.  Besides, my nocturnal
  rustlings are not always appreciated around here, except for the ever
  present cats who always look for a handout.  The coffee is ready though and
  I think I remember where Frances stashed some homemade cookies.

  1 1/4 lb Fettuccine                          1 pn Of ground dried chili
      6 tb Extra-virgin olive oil         
 
  Fettuccine con Crema di Aglio e Peperoncino From the Williams-Sonoma
  Kitchen Library Pasta Cookbook by Lorenza de Medici "Whole roasted garlic
  heads have such a wonderful fragrance and flavor that you might want to
  bake a few extra, for guests to squeeze onto crusty chunks of bread. You
  can also make a similar onion sauce: roast 3 small brown-skinned onions,
  using the same method as for the garlic heads, peel them and puree with the
  oil in a food processor.  Both versions of the California cuisine-inspired
  sauce are also excellent at room temperature."
  
  Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  Wrap each head of garlic separately in
  aluminum foil.  Place the parcels on a rack in the center of the oven and
  bake for 45 minutes. Remove the garlic heads from the oven and set aside to
  cool slightly so that they can be handled. In a large pot bring 6 qt salted
  water to a boil.  Add the fettuccine to the boiling water and cook until al
  dente. Meanwhile, unwrap the garlic heads, separate the cloves and squeeze
  the garlic cloves from their papery sheaths into a hot serving bowl. Add
  the olive oil and season to taste with salt. Sprinkle with the chili and
  blend together well with a fork. Drain the pasta and transfer it to the
  serving bowl. Toss the pasta with the sauce. Serve immediately. Serves 6.

  Indian cuisine is one of John's favorites.  This pasta sauce is basically a
  variation on the Indian raita, a cooling, soothing combination of cucumber,
  cilantro and yogurt.  Do not substitute non-fat yogurt for low-fat: over
  the heat of the pasta, the former becomes too runny. Have all the
  ingredients 1 lb Fettuccine cooked al dente according to package directions
  
  In a large bowl combine the basil, parsley, scallions and tomatoes, and
  toss well to mix Spoon the yogurt over the herbs and vegetables and blend
  well. Taste and add salt and pepper if necessary.
  
  Dive the hot fettuccine among four warm bowls.  Spoon the sauce over it and
  serve immediately.

      Title: Fettucine Alfredo
 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 c  Unsalted (sweet) butter,                 -cheese,
      1 lb Fresh Fettucine noodles             1    Pinch of nutmeg,
    1/2 c  Light cream (or diluted             1    Pinch of fresh parsley
           -Creme Fraiche),                         -(optional),
      1 c  Freshly grated parmesan             1    Little pepper (optional).
 
  Put water on to boil for the noodles.  As the water comes to  a boil, start
  preparing  the sauce.  In  a  separate  pan  melt unsalted (sweet) butter
  over very low heat - DO  NOT  LET  IT BROWN!!
  
  Once  the butter has melted, stir into the butter: light  cream (or the
  diluted Creme Fraiche), freshly grated parmesan cheese. Beat this with a
  whisk to keep the sauce from clumping.   Once the sauce is smooth, season
  the sauce with a pinch of nutmeg, a pinch of fresh parsley (optional), and
  a  little   pepper (optional).
  
  Turn the sauce down to a simmer and add fresh Fettucine noodles (or a batch
  of homemade noodles) to the boiling  water.   When the noodles are cooked
  al dente, drain and toss  gently  with sauce. Serve immediately.
  
  The order of these steps is important, as it is better to  make the sauce
  wait for the noodles than to make the  noodles  wait for the sauce.

      Title: Filo Pastry
 Categories: Greek, Breads
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 2/3 c  Unbleached flour                    2 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Salt                                     Cornstarch, for dusting
    1/2 c  Warm water                               -pastry board
 
  Sift flour and salt into bowl. Gradually add water to make a stiff dough.
  Turn onto pastry board.
  
  Place the oil in a bowl and spread a little of it on the palms of your
  hands. Knead the dough, gradually adding more oil until you have a smooth,
  elastic ball. Roll the ball of dough in the remaining oil to cover all
  sides. Place in a bowl, cover with a cloth, and allow to stand in a warm
  place for about 2 hours.
  
  Divide the dough into 10 parts and roll to 1/4-inch thickness on a pastry
  board dusted with cornstarch. Cover with a cloth and let set for 10
  minutes.
  
  Cover a table or counter top with a smooth cloth and lift rolled dough onto
  it. Put your hands, palms down, under the dough and gently stretch the
  dough with the backs of your hands, working your way around the table until
  the dough is stretched as thin as tissue paper. For moist filo, using
  scissors, cut dough immediately into desired size pieces; if you prefer dry
  filo, allow it to stand for about 10 minutes before cutting.
  
  Yields 10 12x16-inch sheets.

           Pimpernel)                               Ground white pepper
      1 c  Sour cream or plain yogurt               Small pinch of sugar
      2 sm Onions. coarsely chopped            1    To 2 eggs, hardboiled and
      2 tb Cream                                    -coarsely chopped
 
  Choose all or merely a selection of the herbs and greens mentioned in the
  list of ingredients (using the tarragon more sparingly than the others.)
  Wash them thoroughly and drain on paper towels. Coarsely chop the greens;
  loosely packed, they should amount to about 3 cups altogether. Take 2 cups
  of the greens, combine with the sour cream or yogurt and the onions, and
  puree in the blender or processor; add a few tablespoons of cream if it
  doesn't seem to be fluid enough. The rest of the greens should just be
  finely chopped and stirred in a mixing bowl with the puree in order to give
  the sauce a little bite. Stir in as much mayonnaise and low-fat cottage
  cheese as it takes to produce a smooth, creamy sauce.
  
  Season with salt, pepper, and a very little sugar.  The hardboiled eggs can
  either be mixed in with the sauce or strewn over it as a garnish.
  
  Makes 2 - 3 cups.

      Title: French Apple Tart
 Categories: Desserts, French, Pies
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    (9-in) pre-cooked tart shell      3/4 c  Apricot jam
      2 lb Apples                            1/4 c  Calvados
           -preferably Golden Delicious             -=OR=- Dark Rum or Cognac
    1/2    Lemon, juiced                       2 tb Butter
      2 tb Sugar (or more if needed)      
 
  PEEL, QUARTER and core the apples. Slice 3 apples into thin slices, toss
  with lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of the sugar and set aside. Make
  applesauce with the rest of the apples: Chop coarsely, place in a saucepan
  with 2-3 tablespoons of water, cover and cook over a medium-low heat until
  very soft. Warm the jam, then force it through a sieve (fruit bits can be
  returned to the jar). Add 1/4 cup of strained jam to applesauce, together
  with the Calvados and butter. Continue cooking, if needed, until fairly
  thick. Taste and add sugar if needed. It should taste sweet, but not like
  jam. Spread the applesauce over the tart shell, then layer the drained
  apple slices in concentric circles over it. Bake about 30 minutes, until
  the apples are tender. Warm remaining apricot jam, adding a tablespoon or
  so of water if needed, to paint over the tart. Best served warm.

      Title: French Apple Charlotte
 Categories: Desserts, French
      Yield: 8 servings
 
     10    To 12 apples                    1 1/2 c  Unsalted butter
    3/4 c  Sugar                              12 sl Bread, crusts removed
 
  This takes a while to prepare, but it isn't difficult and it has a most
  distinctive and delicious flavor.  (A charlotte mold is round a 3-1/4 -4
  inches high, but a 2 quart souffle dish will do as well.)
  
  Peel and core apples and cut them into thin slices.  Melt the sugar and 5
  tbsp of the butter in a large frying pan.  Add apples, stir until coated
  with butter, cover and cook over low heat until tender.  Uncover and
  continue to simmer until water formed is evaporated.  You should now have a
  thick apple puree.  Cut bread into pieces and completely cover the bottom
  and sides of the mold. (easy when bread is cut into 1 inch strips for
  sides, and triangles for the bottom.)  Then brown the triangle pieces in
  some of the butter and place in bottom of mold.  Dip strips of bread in
  melted butter and line sides.  Pour hot puree into mold and cover with more
  trips of bread dipped in melted butter.  Set the mold on a baking sheet and
  place in a 400 F oven.  Bake 40-50 minutes, or until bread on top is a deep
  golden brown.  Remove from oven and let stand 20 minutes.  Slip a knife
  between mold and bread and turn on to a platter. Serve hot with cream or
  apricot rum sauce. (1/2 cup apricot jam warmed up with 1/4 cup rum.) Serves
  8.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Onions                              1 oz Butter
      1    Chicken 3-4 pounds                  2 tb Flour
           Salt, black pepper             
 
  Serves 6
  
  Peel the onions, quarter them and slice thickly.
  
  Wipe the chicken inside and out with a cloth wrung out in boiling water.
  Cut into 10 serving pieces: 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings and 2 breasts
  halved. Season each piece on both sides. Melt the butter in a sauteuse or
  large frying pan over low heat and when foaming add the chicken and colour
  to the golden stage on both sides. Remove from the pan with a slotted
  spoon, cover and keep hot. Add the onions to the fats in the pan, sea- son,
  increase the heat to medium, mix well and colour to the golden stage,
  moving them around with a  wooden spatula to prevent sticking and colouring
  too fast.
  
  Sprinkle with half the flour and mix in thoroughly before adding the
  remainder. Cook for a few moments, stirring constantly, reduce the heat to
  low, add the  vinegar, stir well and arrange the chicken on top. Cover and
  cook slowly for about 40 minutes until the chicken is tender and the
  moisture from the onions has made the sauce. During this time shake the pan
  frequently and do not lift the lid except to stir the ingredients twice.
  Correct the seasoning if necessary and serve very hot with plain boiled
  potatoes.

      3 c  Farmer cheese                            For apricot dumplings:
      3 tb Sour cream                          3 tb Farmer cheese
      1 tb Powdered sugar                      1 tb Powdered sugar
  1 1/2 c  Cake flour                               For Strawberry dumplings:
     12    Plums (OR 12 apricots, OR 18        5 tb Toasted plain bread crumbs
           -large strawberries)                1 tb Powdered sugar
     24    Cubes sugar (optional)         
 
  1.  In a bowl, combine the butter, salt, and lemon zest. Whip until fluffy.
  Add the whole egg, and egg yolk, and continue to beat to blend.  Beat in
  the farmer cheese, sour cream, and powdered sugar. Add the flour slowly and
  beat until smooth. Allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes at room
  temperature.
  
  2.  Cut the plums or apricots in half and remove the pits, if necessary. If
  the fruit isn't sweet, place 1 cube of sugar in the hollow of each half.
  
  3.  On a marble pastry board, roll out dough 1/2 inch thick. Using a pastry
  wheel, cut the dough into a grid of 5-inch squares. If you're using
  strawberries, make 18 (3-inch) squares.
  
  4.  Place a piece of fruit, cut side down, on each circle of dough and pull
  the pastry up around the fruit. Seal by pinching the pastry together.
  
  The dumplings can be prepared up to 3 hours ahead to this point.
  Refrigerate until ready to boil.
  
  5.  Bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil.  Add 8 dumplings and simmer
  until they rise to the top, approximately 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted
  spoon. Keep warm on a covered plate. Repeat with the remaining dumplings.
  
  6.  To serve: Plum dumplings:  Sprinkle with poppy seeds and powdered sugar
  
  Apricot dumplings:  Sprinkle with farmer cheese, pressed through a sieve,
  and the powdered sugar
  
  Strawberry dumplings:  Roll in the toasted plain bread crumbs and sprinkle
  with the powdered sugar.
  
  ((Note:  My mother used to make these with whole pitted apricots and whole
  pitted plums, always with a sugar cube in the center, and always rolling
  the finished product in the toasted bread crumbs, and the sprinkling the
  dumplings with sugar.  Karin))

 Categories: German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    250 g  Flour (2 cups plus 3 1/2            1    Kaiser-type roll, cubed and
           -Tbsp)                                   -sauteed
      2    Eggs                                     Finely chopped onion greens
           Salt                                1    Pancake, diced
      4 tb To 5 tb water                            Salt and pepper to taste
           Stuffing:                           1    Egg white (for sealing
    500 g  Smoked meat, cooked and                  -edges)
           -diced (a generous lb)         
 
  Dough:
  
  The liquid the smoked meat has been cooked in makes a suitable broth.
  
  Combine the flour, eggs, salt, and water into a pasta dough. Knead well,
  and immediately roll out thin on a floured pastry board.  Cut the dough
  into 5-inch squares.
  
  Make the stuffing by mixing the smoked meat, sauteed cubed roll, onion
  greens, and diced pancake.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Put one heaping
  tablespoon of this stuffing on each square of dough.  Brush the edges of
  the dough with egg white, and fold each square over, into a triangle.  With
  your fingers, press the edges of the dough which should seal immediately.
  Put the 'Maultaschen' into barely cooking salted water, and let them simmer
  for 5 minutes, turning over the pasta once.
  
  Carefully remove 'Maultaschen' from water, as they are very fragile.
  Immediately transfer them to the hot broth, and serve.
  
  Serves 4.

  gradually pour hot beef broth over the top of the meatloaf; brush
  occasionally with pan drippings. When done remove meat to a preheated

      Title: German Pancakes
 Categories: Pancakes, German, Breakfast
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4    Eggs                                3 ts Sugar
      1 c  Flour                           1 1/3 c  Milk
    1/4 ts Salt                                1 c  Butter (2 sticks)
 
  Cinnamon sugar Juice of 1 lemon jam...suggested are loganberry, boysenberry
  or seedless raspberry
  
  You will need a LARGE skillet for these...
  
  Beat the eggs until light and frothy.  Add flour, salt, sugar and milk.
  Beat for 5 minutes more.  The batter will be thin, but very smooth and
  creamy.
  
  Place 2 T of butter into the pan for each pancake.  Heat until pan is very
  hot, but don't allow butter to burn.  Ladle in enough batter with one hand
  so that, with the other hand holding the skillet handle and rotating the
  skillet, there is just enough batter to cover the bottom and slightly up
  the sides of thepan, but not a lot of excess.  This will produce a giant,
  crepelike pancake.
  
  Check the cake by gently lifting the edge with a spatula.  When it is
  nicely browned, tunr the cake.  The second side will brown quickly.
  
  Place the pancake onto a warm plate, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar then
  lemon juice, then spread with jam.  Roll up like a small jellyroll, sprinle
  again with cinnamon sugar, cut into two pieces, and serve.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 c  Yellow mustard seed                 1 ts Salt
      2 tb Black or brown mustard seed,        2    Garlic gloves, minced or

    1/2 c  Water                             1/4 ts Ground allspice
  1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar                     1/4 ts Dried tarragon leaves

      2 tb Firmly packed brown sugar      
 
  Adapted from Gift Ideas from the Kitchen
  
  In a small bowl, combine mustard seed and dry mustard.  In a 1- to 2-quart
  non-aluminim pan, combine remaining ingredients.  Simmer uncovered, on
  medium heat until reduced by half, 10-15 minutes. Pour the mixture into the
  mustard mixture. Let mixture soak at room temperature 24 to 48 hours,adding
  additional vinegar if neccesary in order to maintain enough liquid to cover
  seeds.
  
  Process the seeds and mixture in a blender or food processor until pureed
  to the texture you like --this can take at least 3 or 4 minutes. Some
  prefer whole seeds remaining, others a smooth paste. The mixture will
  thicken considerably upon standing. If it gets too thick after a few
  days,stir in additional vinegar.
  
  Scrape mustard into clean, dry jars; cover tightly and age at least 3 days

      Title: Glitscher
 Categories: Vegetables, German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 md Raw potatoes                        2    Eggs
  1 3/4 lb Potatoes, boiled in their         1/4 c  Water
           -jackets a day ahead                     Salt
      3 tb To 4 tb (heaping) flour        
 
  So called for their well-known propensity to slip ('glitschen') off one's
  plate, 'Glitscher' are also called 'Wetzsteine' (whetstones) because they
  are more or less the same shape (although shorter) as the old-fashioned
  sharpening stones used for a sickle or scythe blade.
  
  Grate the raw potatoes into a bowl full of water, then place in a coarse
  muslin bag or wrap in a rolled-up dishtowel, and wring out thoroughly.  The
  boiled potatoes should be cooked a day in advance, then peeled and grated
  on the following day.  Combine the two, along with the flour, eggs, and
  water, and mix thoroughly; season with salt.  Shape the dumplings with wet
  hands.  The dumplings should be fairly long and pointed at both ends.  Cook
  in simmering salted water for about 20 minutes.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

  Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time:  1:30 To make
  gnocchi, pour flour onto work surface and make a well in the centre. Pour
  in the olive oil.  Dissolve saffron in a bit of warm water and add to well.
  Mix liquid with flour, adding enough water to form a firm, not sticky,
  dough.  You'll have to add the water 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough is
  the right consistency.  Cut dough into pieces and roll into long cylinders,
  about 1/2 inch diameter.  Cut into 1-inch chunks and press your finger into
  each gnocchi to make a deep dent. Set gnocchi aside on a floured surface to
  dry while you make the sauce. Heat pork fat in saute pan and cook the onion
  and parsley until tender. Stir in the ground meat and cook until no longer
  pink.  Add the chopped tomatoes, bay leaves, salt and pepper. Cook,
  uncovered, for an hour or until the sauce is thickened. Cook gnocchi in
  boiling salted water until cooked al dente.  Drain and arrange in pasta
  dishes.  Pour sauce over top and garnish with a handful of grated cheese.

      Title: Gosh Feel (Elephant Ear Pastries)
 Categories: Ethnic, Desserts
      Yield: 40 servings
 
      2    Eggs                            2 1/2 c  Plain flour
      2 ts Caster sugar                      1/4 c  Plain flour for kneading
    1/4 ts Salt                              1/2 ts Ground cardamom
    1/2 c  Milk                                     Oil for deep-frying
      4 ts Oil                           

---------------------------------TO FINISH---------------------------------
      1 c  Icing (confectioners') sugar      1/2 c  Finely chopped pistachios
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom (optional)     
 
  *Note: Pistachio nuts should be blanched.  Optionally, same amount of
  finely chopped walnuts may be used intead of pistachios.
  
  Beat eggs until frothy, beat in sugar and salt. Stir in milk and oil. Sift
  flour, add half to egg mixture and blend in with wooden spoon. Gradually
  stir in remainder of flour, holding back about 1/2 cup.  Turn onto floured
  board and dust with some of reserved flour.  Knead for 10 minutes until
  smooth and glossy, using more flour as required.  Dough will still be
  slightly sticky.   Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 2 hours.
  
  Take a piece of dough about the size of a large hazelnut and roll out on a
  floured board to a circle about 8-10 cm (3-4 inches) in diameter.  Gather
  up dough on one side and pinch, forming a shape resembling an elephant ear.
  Place on a cloth and cover.  Repeat with remaining dough.
  
  Deep fry one at a time in oil, heated to 190 C (375 F) turning to cook
  evenly.  Fry until golden, do not over-brown.  As dough is rather elastic,
  the pastry tends to contract with handling, so just before dropping pastry
  into hot oil, pull out lightly with fingers to enlarge.
  
  Drain pastries on paper towels.  Sift icing sugar with cardamom if used and
  dust pastries with mixture.  Sprinkle with nuts and serve warm or cold.
  Store in a sealed container.
  
  Alternative topping:  Make a syrup with 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water.
  Bring to the boil when sugar is dissolved and boil for 5 minutes.  Dribble
  syrup onto warm pastries and sprinkle with cardamom and nuts.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1    -Lemon, juice only, instead
      6 oz Frozen grape juice;undiluted      1/2 c  Whole walnuts
    1/2 c  Sugar or honey                      3 tb Cornstarch
      1 sm Box pectin jell                   1/4 c  Cold water
           Citric acid (pea-sized);*OR*   
 
  Candied nuts and grape juice, "soutzouki", is an ancient candy recipe still
  being used in the villages of Greece.  The traditional recipe is quite
  involved, calling for the stringing of walnuts like beads on linen thread,
  boiling many pounds of grapes into a thick syrup and coating the nuts by
  pouring the thick syrup over them just as if you were making candies until
  a purple necklace is formed.  You can make this recipe in a simpler way
  without having to stamp on the grapes with bare feet.
  
      In a large deep pot bring juice and honey or sugar to a vigorous boil.
  Add pectin and boil 5 minutes.  Dissolve citric acid first in a tablespoon
  of hot syrup, then add to the rest of the syrup, mixing it in.  Add nuts.
  Dissolve cornstarch in cold water and mix into syrup, stirring quickly.
  Cook 1 minutes more.
      Ladle thick mixture on to heavy waxed paper.  Make a long thick roll.
  Pick up two sides of paper and press together to make a fat sausage of
  candy.  Let set at room temperature.  Store in plastic bag.  Slice as
  needed.

  bottom of each sprayed cup, reserving remaining layers.  Arrange 1/10 of
  cheese mixture over each biscuit in cup, then top each with remaining
  biscuit layer; press around edge of each biscuit to seal.  Partially fill
  remaining cups with water (this will prevent pan from burning and/or

    Cook pasta tender but firm. Do NOT overcook!
  
    Brown the meat with the chopped onions and garlic.  Add the spices, sugar
  to taste, and the drained tomatoes.  Let the sauce simmer 30-45 min. Mix in

    To make the topping, melt the butter (or margarine) in a saucepan and mix
  in the flour to form a paste.  Add the milk and heat at medium stirring
  constantly until mixture thickens.  When thick, add parmesan and crumbled
  feta cheese and stir until melted.  A few tablespoons of parmesan and about
  6 ounces of feta.
  
    LET THIS MIXTURE COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE ADDING THE BEATEN EGGS!!! After
  the eggs are stirred in, pour this mixture over the meat and pasta. Bake
  about 45 min or until brown.
  
    This dish is a bit like moussaka because of the topping.
  
  NOTE: 6/12/93 - Made this dish with Montery Jack cheese instead of feta.
  Used 1 to 1 1/2 cup tomato sauce instead of canned tomatoes and 2 eggs.
  Came out Delicious!!! - Set oven for 350-375F and cook a full 40 minutes.

  the same skillet and cook the onions until they are brown. Add the ground
  meat and cook 10 minutes. Pour off excess fat. Combine the tomato paste
  with the wine, parsley, cinnamon, salt and peper. Stir this mixture into
  the meat and simmer over low heat, stirring frequently, until all the
  liquid has been absorbed. Remove the mixture from the fire. Preheat the
  oven to 375F. Make a white sauce by melting the butter and blending in the
  flour, stirring with a wire whisk. Meanwhile, bring the milk to a boil and
  add it gradually to the butter-flour mixture, stirring constantly. When the
  mixture is thickened and smooth, remove it from the heat. Cook slightly and
  stir in the beaten eggs, nutmeg and ricotta. Grease an 11x16-inch pan and
  sprinkle the bottom lightly with crumbs. Arrange alternate layers of the
  eggplant and the meat sauce in the pan, sprinkling each layer with Parmesan
  and crumbs. Pour the ricotta sauce over the top and bake 1 hour, or until
  top is golden. Remove from the oven and cool 20 to 30 minutes before
  serving. Cut into squares and serve. The flavors in this dish really
  improve if you make it a day ahead.

      Title: Greek Tomato Sauce with Olive Oil
 Categories: Greek, Sauces
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/4 c  Red wine
      2 tb Olive oil                                Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 sm Onion; chopped                      1    Stick cinnamon (optional)
      2    Garlic cloves; minced               2    Sprigs parsley; chopped
      2 lb Fresh tomatoes*                     1    Sprig fresh basil; chopped
      1 ts Granulated sugar               
 
  *Note: Tomatoes should be peeled and chopped if fresh, or you may
  substitute 1 two-and-one-half pound can plum tomatoes, chopped.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan, stir in the onions, and cook gently until
  transparent.  Add the garlic, tomatoes, sugar, wine, salt and pepper, and
  cinnamon, if desired.  Taste for seasoning, then allow the sauce to simmer
  gently for 30 minutes.  Remove the cinnamon stick before serving hot.
  
  NOTE:  For a thicker sauce, add 1/4 cup tomato paste diluted with 1/4 cup
  water when adding the tomatoes.  For a smoother consistency, the sauce may
  be strained and seeds discarded just before the parsley and basil are
  added.

      Title: Greek Tsoureki (Easter Bread)
 Categories: Greek, Breads
      Yield: 2 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      5 tb Orange juice
      1 c  Milk                                1 tb Grated orange rind
    1/2 c  Sweet butter                    5 1/2 c  Sifted flour
      1 pk Active dry yeast                         Butter; melted
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar                         Red-dyed, hard-boiled eggs
      1 ts Salt                              1/4 c  Slivered almonds
      2    Eggs; beaten                        2 tb Granulated sugar
 
  In a small saucepan, combine the milk and butter over medium heat and
  scald.  Stir until the butter melts, then pour into a mixing bowl.  When
  lukewarm, sprinkle in the yeast, and with fingers or a heavy spoon
  gradually stir in the 1/2 cup sugar until it dissolves.  Then add the salt,
  eggs 3 tablespoons of the orange juice, and the orange rind, stirring
  continuously, and gradually add half the flour until the mixture begins to
  bubble.  Continue adding flour gradually by hand; the dough will be sticky,
  but should not be stiff.  Flour your fingers lightly and knead for 15
  minutes.  Place the dough in a large buttered bowl, brush the dough with
  melted butter, cover, and place in a warm area to rise until doubled in
  bulk (approximately 2 to 3 hours).
     Punch the dough down and divide into 2 parts.  Divide each half into 3
  parts and roll each into a long rope about 10" x 2".  Braid the three ropes
  together; pinch to seal the ends if leaving long, or join together to form
  a long round loaf (see note below).  Repeat with the other half of the
  dough to make a second tsoureki.  Place in large baking pans or on a cookie
  sheet, cover, and let rise until doubled in bulk (approx. 1 1/2 hours).
     Meanwhile, prepare the glaze by mixing the remaining orange juice,
  remaining sugar, and the almonds in a small bowl.  Bake the tsourekia in a
  375 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and with a pastry
  brush glaze the tops and sides of loaves.  Return to the oven and bake for
  another 15 to 20 minutes until the color is a rich and shiny chestnut.
     Note:  If using the Easter eggs, tuck them into the center when you
  shape the loaves, leave until loaves have doubled and bake them with the
  loaf.  After baking, though lovely, the eggs will be inedible.  Also in
  some provinces, the tsoureki is formed with a large braid and a smaller one
  over it, making a much larger loaf requiring a longer baking time. From
  "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles.

      Title: Gruiben (Cracklings)
 Categories: Pork/ham, German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 kg Fresh pork bacon [the fatty              -1/2 lbs)
           -layer right underneath           1/8 l  Milk or water (1/2 cup plus
           The skin.  K.B.] (approx. 5              -1/2 Tbsp)
 
  Cut the bacon into 3/4-inch cubes and put into a tall pot which must not
  get filled more than halfway up (to prevent the large amount of foam during
  the rendering process from running over and spilling).  Heat up slowly,
  else the bacon will stick to the bottom and scorch.  As soon as there is a
  little liquid fat covering the bottom of the pot, add milk or water, and
  heat up more, constantly stirring.  Let the cracklings brown a little bit
  more, then pour off the liquid lard, through a sieve, into an earthenware
  pot.  Warm cracklings are very popular in-between meal.

  very hot, pour over the potato salad, and lightly stir in.
  
  In olden times, this was eaten with a slice of rye bread. Today, one could
  serve it with something like an endive (escarole) salad.

      Title: Gyros (Doners, Yeros)
 Categories: Greek
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Lean lamb, ground                        Salt & freshly ground pepper
      2    Bread slices;toasted,crushed        3    Slices bacon (?!!)
      1 ts Allspice; pounded (?)               6    Pita bread pockets
      1 ts Coriander; crushed                  2    Tomatoes; sliced thin
      1    Garlic clove; crushed                    Vinegar & oil to taste
      1    Onion; grated                       1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1 ts Chopped fresh savory                1 c  Plain yogurt
 
  In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb with the bread, allspice,
  coriander, garlic, onion, savory, and salt and pepper, and knead
  thoroughly.  The mixture should be spicy, though not too herby, and hold
  its shape.  Break into 5 sections, each as large as a navel orange, then
  break each section into 6 balls.  Knead and flatten slightly to a thickness
  of about 3/4".  Cut the bacon slices into widths equal to these balls,
  keeping the slices of bacon between them.  Slip a cane skewer through the
  centers and roll gently with the palms to smooth the edges.
  
  (There will be 5 or 6 skewers, depending on their length.)  Cover and
  refrigerate overnight.  When ready to cook, set on a broiler tray or grill
  and cook under moderate heat, turning every 5 minutes.  (The bacon will
  baste the meat.)  The surface will be crusty and the inside cooked within
  25 minutes.  To serve:  Put out the bread, meat, tomatoes seasoned with the
  vinegar and oil, parsley and yogurt in separate dishes.  Guests may open
  pocket bread and stuff them with meat and seasonings.

    250 g  Ground pork (a generous 1/2         1 bn Parsley, finely chopped
           -lb)                                1 pn Sugar

           -lb)                                1    Onion, sliced
    100 g  Plain breadcrumbs (3.5 oz)          4    To 5 cloves garlic, whole
      2    Eggs                              1/2    Yellow turnip, sliced
      1    Onion, finely chopped                    -[substitute: carrot]
      1    Clove garlic, mashed or                  Water for pan gravy
           -minced                        
 
  Mix the ground meat with all the other ingredients [except for the lard,
  the sliced yellow turnip, sliced onion, and whole garlic cloves] and shape
  into a rectangular loaf.  Put in a casserole dish with the lard, the sliced
  onion, whole garlic cloves, and sliced yellow turnip.  Roast at 390 degrees
  F until the onions turn brown.  Then, add a little bit of water. Continue
  to roast, basting frequently.  Add more water as needed. If the crust is
  getting too dark, cover the top of the meatloaf with aluminum foil.  In the
  olden days, the cook put a clay tile on top of the meatloaf to achieve the
  same effect.
  
  At 390 degrees F, the meatloaf will be done after 1 1/2 hours and may be
  served immediately, sliced, and topped with the reheated pan juices.
  
  Serve with potato salad or green salad [lettuce].
  
  Serves 4.

    1/2 lb Liver ; 225 grams                   1 pn -Pepper
    1/2 lb Beef, minced; 225 grams             1 pn Nutmeg;grated

      1 ts -Salt                               1 pn Cayenne pepper
 
  "Haggis, "The great Chieftain of the pudding' race", as Robert Burns,
  described it, is indeed a toothsome morsel and it is a great pity that many
  English people look upon it as more a Scottish joke than a good Scottish
  dish. However since Haggis is made from the stomach, lungs and other
  internals of a sheep it is a rather gruesome sight during certain stages of
  its cooking, as anyone who has witnessed the process will agree. The lung
  must be first be heating in a pan of hot water with the trachea hanging
  over the side to allow any blood and froth to escape and the stomach bag
  must be cleaned and scraped very thoroughly before it is used. I must say
  from experience that it takes needs a fairly robust stomach to first
  prepare and then eat it. If you can buy prepared haggis I do strongly
  recommend you to try it. All you need to do is slice it and fry it in a
  lightly greased frying pan. If you cannot buy ready-made haggis, then the
  following is tasty substitute.."
  
  Boil the liver for five minutes. Drain and put aside to cool. Toast the
  oatmeal in a dry frying pan or in the oven until it begins to turn a pale
  brown. Peel and mince the onions and the liver. Mix all the ingredients
  with the seasoning and stir in some of the water in which the liver has
  been boiled. The mixture should be thoroughly moist but not wet. Have ready
  a greased basin large enough to give the mixture room to swell. Cover with
  greaseproof paper and a cloth and boil or steam for three hours. The
  traditional way to serve haggis is with mashed potatoes and turnips -
  "tatties and neeps", as they are called in Scotland - and to give the meal
  a truly Scottish flavour you should serve a glass of whiskey along with it.
  I like to let the mock haggis go cold and then slice it and heat it through
  in a frying pan (without fat) until golden brown on both sides. This way it
  is very good with poached eggs and even with chips.
  
  Note: if your mince looks to be on the fatty side, then cut down the
  quantity of suet to 4 oz (100grams).

      Title: Haggis (Scotch-Canadian)
 Categories: Pork/ham, Canadian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Pork fat or salt pork               2 ts Salt
      1 lb Pork liver; approx 3 lb           1/2 ts Pepper
  1 1/2 c  Rolled oats                    
 
  This New Brunswick recipe reflects a change in the traditional haggis - a
  change which recent Scottish arrivals consider akin to sacrilege.
  
  Directions:  Grease a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan.  Cut Pork fat in cubes and fry
  out the fat from the pork or salt pork fat. Pour off the grease as it
  accumulates.  When the pieces are golden brown and crisp they are called
  "crackin's in Ontario, or "Kips" in the Maritimes.  Drain well. Cool.
  
  Wash the pork liver and place in a large pot.  Cover with boiling water and
  boil for about 1 hour, or until a fork can easily be inserted. Remove liver
  and allow to cool. Reserve liquid. Put cooled liver and 2 cups of
  cracklin's through the food grinder. Mix together. Stir in the oats, salt
  and pepper.  Add sufficient cooking liquid to hold mixture together. Press
  into prepared loaf pan, cover with waxed paper and foil. Steam for 1 hour.
  Cool.
  
  To Serve, slice 1/2 inch thick and pan fry until golden brown on both
  sides. Serve piping hot.

      2 c  Pinhead oatmeal; (Irish        
 
  Thoroughly wash the stomach bag in cold water.  Turn it inside out and
  scald it, then scrape the surface with a knife. Soak it in cold salted
  water overnight. Next day remove the bag from the water and leave it on one
  side while preparing the filling. Wash the pluck. Put it into a pan, with
  the windpipe hanging over the side into a bowl, to let out any impurities.
  Cover the pluck with cold water, add 1 teaspoon of salt and bring the water
  to a boil. Skim the surface, then simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Meanwhile
  parboil the onions, drain, reserving the ligquid, and chop them roughly.
  Also tpast the pinhead oatmeal until golden brown. Drain the pluck when
  ready and cut away the windpipe and any excess gristle. Mince half the
  liver with all the heart and lights, then stir in the shredded suet, the
  toasted oatmeal and the onions. Season well with salt and pepper. Moisten
  with as much of the onion or pluck water as necessary to make the mixture
  soft. With the rough surface of the bag outside fill it just over half
  full, the oatmeal will swell during cooking, and sew the ends together with
  the trussing needle and fine string. Prick the bag in places with the
  needlw. Place the haggis on and enamel plate and put it into a pan of
  boiling water. Cover the pan and cook for about 3 hours, adding more
  boiling water when necessary to keep the haggis covered. Serve with the
  traditional accompaniment of Tatties-an'Neeps. (Mashed potatoes and mashed
  turnips.)
  
  This is typically served on Burns' Night, January 25, when Scotland
  celebrates the birth of their greatest poet, Robert Burns, who was born in
  Ayrshire on that date in 1759. During the celebration, Burns poems are
  read, and the haggis is addressed by a member of the party, ceremonially,
  in the for of verses from Burns' poem, "Address to a Haggis" A typical meal
  for Burn's night would include, Cock-a-Leekie, Haggis with
  Tattie-an'-neeps, Roastit Beef, Tipsy Laird, and Dunlop Cheese.

  fancy dictates.
  
  In another version of this casserole, the ingredients are all mixed
  together in one bowl, along with 3 eggs, the souffle pan is well greased
  with butter (always recommended), and the contents of the bowl transferred

           -flour                              2 ts Chopped fresh thyme OR 1 tsp

      4 tb Olive oil                           2 ts Chopped fresh sage OR 1 tsp
  1 1/2 c  Cubed ham or pork                        -crumbled dried
 
  ...This French style loaf can be made from start to finish in a little over
  an hour.  It's a hearty loaf that is delicious sliced and lightly toasted
  and served with soups, stews, and salads...
  
  generous grinding of black pepper
  
  1.  Place the yeast in a large mixing bowl.  Mix in the warm water and
  honey and set aside in a warm spot for about 10 minutes, or until the yeast
  is dissolved and begins bubbling. (If the yeast does not bubble it is
  probably dead. Begin again, using fresh yeast.) Gradually sift the flour
  and salt into the yeast mixture, stirring constantly until the dough begins
  to pull away from the sides of the bowl.
  
  2.  Sprinkle some flour over a working surface and gently knead the dough
  for several minutes.  Cut the dough in half and roll out one half into a
  rectangle (like a rectangular pizza) about 14 inches by 10 inches. Brush
  the dough with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Scatter half the ham
  over the surface, pressing it gently into the dough.. Sprinkle half the
  cheese on top and scatter half the herbs and a generous grinding of fresh
  black pepper over the dough.  Using your hands, gently roll the dough
  lengthwise, into the shape of a long cigar. Lightly seal the edges of the
  dough.  Place in a well-greased French bread pan (or on a well-greased
  cookie sheet) and cover with a clean tea towel.
  
  3.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
  
  4.  Make the second loaf.  Place the two loaves of bread in a dry warm spot
  and let the sit, covered, for 15 minutes.
  
  5.  Just before baking, lightly brush the loaves with the remaining 1
  tablespoon of olive oil.  Place in the middle shelf of the hot oven and
  bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until the bread has a golden brown crust and
  sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
  
  Serves 8.  Makes 2 loaves.

      2    Egg yolks                       2 1/2 c  Flour, unbleached
    1/4 c  Sugar                               1 c  Oil, olive or otherwise for

      1 ts Lemon rind, grated                       -Confectioner's or icing
      3 tb Olive oil                                -sugar
 
  Orecchi di Aman For the Italian Jews orecchi di Aman are as synonymous with
  the festival of Purim as the Hamantaschen are for the Ashkenazim.
  
  In a small bowl, beat the eggs, egg yolks with the sugar, lemon rind, olive
  oil, vanilla extract and rum. Gradually add enough flour to make a rahter
  soft dough. Turn out onto a floured working surface and knead for 2 or 3
  minutes. Roll very thin. With a pastry cutter or sharp knife, cut into
  strips 1 inch x 4 to 7 inches. Slowly heat the oil in a small saucepan.
  (Oil is at the right temperature when a small piece of dough drops into it
  floats and begins to sizzle.) Fry a few strips at a time, twirling them to
  give them odd shapes until they are lightly golden. (Tie the longer pieces
  into a knot before frying them.) Drain and place on a paper towe. When all
  the ears are done, transfer to a large serving dish, sprinkling each layer
  with confectioner's sugar (through a sieve). YIELDS: 2 to 3 dozen

    3/4 c  Sugar                               1 ts Vanilla Extract
      6 tb Water                               2 tb Confectioners' Sugar

      1 ts Baking Powder                            Fresh Strawberries, Optional
 
  Beat the egg yolks and sugar until very light, about 5 minutes.  Slowly add
  the water.  Sift the flour and baking powder together.  Mix with 1 cup of
  nuts.  Fold the flour mixture into the egg yolks.  Beat the egg whites
  until soft peaks form.  Gently fold the beaten whites into the batter. Pour
  into a greased and floured 10-inch springform pan.  Bake at 375 degrees F
  for 30 minutes or until cake is done.  Cool cake on a wire rack. When
  completely cooled, split the cake into 2 layers.  Fold the vanilla,
  confectioners' sugar, and remaining 1/2 cup of nuts into the whipped cream.
  Spread whipped cream between the 2 cake layers and on top of the cake.
  Chill until serving time.  Garnish with fresh strawberries, if desired. *
  Hazelnuts are available at most stores under the name of Filberts. They
  should be blanched.  To blanch, boil the nuts for 5 minutes and when they
  are cool enough to handle, remove the skins.  To grind, place about 1/4 cup
  at a time in a blender, or chop as finely as you can with a sharp knife.

      Title: Herbed Focaccia
 Categories: Breads, Italian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast                           1 ts Dried rosemary
      1 ts Sugar                               1 ts Dried basil
      1 c  Warm water (105-115F)               1 ts Dried oregano
  2 1/3 c  Bread flour                              Kosher salt
    1/3 c  Cornmeal                            1 tb Fresh chives, snipped
  1 1/4 ts Salt                                1 tb Fresh parsley, minced
    1/2 c  Light-tasting olive oil             1 tb Red pepper flakes
      2 lg Garlic cloves; minced          
 
  A small amount of cornmeal gives this focaccia--a flat bread--a perfect
  texture for improvised open sandwiches. You might start with thinly sliced
  salami and cheese.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Fifteen minutes before baking focaccia, put rack in
  center of oven. If you have 2 ovens, preheat both; otherwise bake focaccias
  in sequence, one after the other. Generously oil 2 large baking sheets,
  preferably black steel. Stir yeast and sugar into warm water. Let stand
  until foamy, about 5 minutes. Mix flour, cornmeal and salt in food
  processor fitted with metal blade (can also be kneaded with mixer dough
  hook or by hand). Turn on processor. Slowly pour yeast mixture through feed
  tube. Also pour 2 tablespoons oil through. Process until dough cleans
  inside of work bowl but is still moist. If it sticks, add a little flour;
  if it's dry, add a little water. Once dough is moist but not so wet that it
  sticks to sides of bowl, process until uniformly kneaded, elastic and
  supple, about 40 seconds. Transfer dough to large plastic food bag, squeeze
  out air and seal at top, allowing room for dough to expand. Let dough rise
  in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; use immediately or
  refrigerate overnight. Combine remaining 6 tablespoons oil, garlic and
  dried herbs. Gently heat until warm (not hot) on stove top or microwave
  oven. Divide dough in half. Let rest 5 minutes. On floured board, roll each
  piece into about a 12-inch round. Transfer to prepared baking sheets. Prick
  surface with fork. Brush with oil mixture, including edges. Sprinkle with
  Kosher salt. Bake, one at a time, until very lightly browned around edges
  only, about 8-10 minutes. Do not overbake. Check after 2 minutes in oven;
  prick any air pockets with fork. Brush with any remaining oil, including

      Title: Hollandse Kippesoep (Spiced Chicken Soup)
 Categories: Ethnic, Soups/stews, Poultry
      Yield: 8 servings
 
----------------------------MM BY HELEN PEAGRAM----------------------------
      4 lb Chicken, cut in pieces          1 1/2 ts Salt
      1    Onion, peeled                     1/2 ts Thyme
      4    Cloves, whole                     1/2 ts Rosemary
    1/2 ts Mace                                4    Sprigs parsley
    1/4 ts Pepper                              2 lg Carrots, cut in chunks
      2    Celery stalks, cut in             1/4 lb Vermicelli pasta
           -chunks                                  Chopped fresh parsley
      2    Bay leaves                     
 
  In the 1600's when Amsterdam was a booming commercial centre, the Dutch
  East India Company brought pungent spices, such as nutmeg, cinnamon and
  cloves, to Holland.  These spices linger on in Dutch cooking.  If mace is
  not available, nutmeg can be substituted.
  
  In a large pot, place chicken.  Pour in enough boiling water to cover;
  bring to a boil over high heat.  Remove chicken to a clean pot.  Stud onion
  with cloves and add to chicken along with bay leaves, 1/2 ts salt, thyme,
  rosemary, mace, pepper, celery, parsley sprigs and carrots.  Pour in 12
  cups cold water.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to low and
  simmer, covered for 5 hours, or until meat comes away from the bones. Let
  cool and skim off fat.  Strain through cheesecloth lined sieve. Remove meat
  from bones, chop and set aside.
  
  Return chicken stock to a clean pot and bring to a boil.  Add vermicelli.
  Cook for 5 minutes.  Return chicken and remaining salt to pot.  Cook just
  until heated through.  Taste and adjust seasonings.  Garnish with chopped
  parsley.

      Title: Homemade "Little Ears" Orecchiette Casalinga
 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Semolina flour                    3/4 c  Lukewarm water
      2 c  Unbleached flour                         -(approximately)
    1/4 ts Salt                           
 
  Source: 'The Good Cook - Pasta' Serves: Makes about 1 1/2 pounds fresh
  pasta, or 10-12 oz dried pasta
  
  Combine the semolina, unbleached flour and salt, and mound it on a large
  work surface. Make a well in the center with your finger and pour in 3 - 4
  Tbls. water. Begin pulling the flour from the inner wall of the well into
  the liquid. Add more water and continue forming a paste until the flour has
  absorbed as much water as possible with becoming hard or dry. The perfect
  consistency is softer than the basic flour and egg pasta, but not at all
  sticky. Knead vigorously on a lightly floured board until the dough is
  smooth and elastic. This may take 20 minutes or so. Form the dough into a
  ball and cover.
  
  To make the 'little ears', pull off a scant handful of the dough (keep the
  rest of the dough covered). On a lightly floured board, roll the dough into
  a rope about 3/4 inch in diameter. Cut the rope into slices no more than
  1/8 inch thick to form small circles of dough. Now put one of these circles
  into the cupped palm of your hand and, with the thumb of the other hand,
  press and turn the circle at the same time to form a dent in the center
  that will spread the dough a little on each side. It should look like a
  small ear, with slightly thicker ear lobes. Repeat with all of the
  remaining dough, placing the orecchiette on a lightly floured cloth as they
  are made.
  
  The orecchiette are cooked in the same manner as fresh flour and egg pasta,
  although they take longer to cook. Watch them carefully and taste
  frequently for doneness.

      Title: Homemade Pan Bread with Fresh Herbs
 Categories: Breads, Spices/etc., Italian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 c  Warm water                        1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Dry yeast                           1 tb Dry italian seasonings
      3 tb Sugar                               2 tb Minced fresh garlic
      6 c  To 7 c all purpose flour          1/4 c  Chopped fresh basil leaves
      1 tb Salt                                2 tb Chopped fresh oregano
 
  From Sheryl Benesch, Korbel Champagne Cellars.
  
  This pan bread has an Italian heritage.  It does not need butter and is
  best eaten shortly after it has emerged from the oven. It is excellent with
  vegetable soups.
  
  Combine the waterm, yeast, sugar, and approximately 2 cups of the flour to
  make a thick paste.  Mix thoroughly and let stand a few minutes until
  bubbles rise to the surface.
  
  Combine the salt with the remaining flour; add gradually to the yeast
  mixture, until it will absorb no more flour.  Knead the dough until the
  texture is smooth and not sticky to the touch; about 5 to 10 minutes. Place
  the dough in an oiled bowl and let it rise in a warm place until it has
  doubled in bulk.  Punch dough down, place on a lightly floured surface, and
  knead for another minute. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  Brush a 9 x 13 inch sheet pan with 1/3 of the olive oil. Sprinkle the pan
  with 1/2 tablespoon of the dry Italian seasonings and 1 tablespoon of
  garlic.  Roll the bread dough out to line the pan.
  
  Lay the dough into the pan, brush with the remaining olive oil, sprinkle
  with the remaining garlic and Italian seasonings, and then the fresh herbs.
  (At this point the bread may be prepared a day ahead and kept in the
  refrigerator, on the prepared pan, to rise.)
  
  Let the dough rise for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Bake in a preheated 350
  degrees F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.
  
  Serves 8 to 12.

      1 c  Butter                              6 c  Plain flour
    3/4 c  Caster sugar                        4 ts Baking powder
    3/4 c  Maize or peanut oil               3/4 c  Orange juice

---------------------------NUT FILLING (OPTIONAL---------------------------
      1 tb Honey                           1 1/2 c  Finely chopped walnuts
      2 ts Orange juice                        2 dr Almond essence
  1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon               

--------------------------------HONEY SYRUP--------------------------------
      1 c  Sugar                           1 1/2 ts Lemon juice
      1 c  Water                               1    Thin strip of lemon rind
    1/2    Cinnamon stick                    1/4 c  Honey
 
  Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F)
  
  Beat butter and sugar with orange rind until creamy.  Gradually add oil and
  continue beating until mixture is very light and fluffy.  Stir in flour
  alternately with orange juice.  Knead dough lightly with hands for 1
  minute.
  
  Take a scant tablespoon of dough and flatten it a little.  Place a teaspoon
  of the nut filling in the centre and fold dough over to enclose filling.
  
  Shape into ovals, pinching ends to a point.  Decorate tops with tines of
  fork or by crimping cookies diagonally across top in four rows with special
  crimper (see NOTE), or leave them plain.
  
  Place on lightly greased baking trays and bake in a moderate oven for 20-25
  minutes until golden brown.  Cool on wire racks.
  
  Dip in boiling syrup, four at a time, turning cookies once.  Leave in syrup
  10 seconds in all, longer if well-soaked cookies are preferred. Lift out
  onto a plate and leave until cool.
  
  (If no nut filling is used, sprinkle tops with crushed walnuts or toasted
  sesame seeds and cinnamon.  Only those which are to be served should be
  dipped; store remainder in an airtight container and dip when required.
  
  TO MAKE NUT FILLING: Thin honey down with orange juice and blend into
  remaining ingredients.
  
  TO MAKE HONEY SYRUP: Place ingredients in a heavy-based saucepan and stir
  over heat until sugar dissolves.  Bring to the boil and boil over
  moderately high heat for 10 minutes and skim.  Let syrup boil on a moderate
  heat while dipping cookies.  Add a little water to syrup when it thickens
  too much during dipping.
  
  NOTE: Icing crimpers will be familiar to many pastrycooks and cake
  decorators who work with icing.  If you don't own a crimper (or have never
  seen one), have the family handyman cut a piece of tin or aluminium plate
  about 2.5 x 10 cm (1 x 4 inches).  Bend metal in half over a thin rod and
  cut 6 to 8 evenly spaced saw-like teeth on the narrow edges.  Curl the
  "teeth" slightly inwards.

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 c  Chopped nuts (or more) *            1    Orange (grated rind only)
    1/4 c  Sugar                             1/2 lb Commercial filo sheets
    1/2 ts Cinnamon                          1/2 lb Sweet butter; melted

-----------------------------------SYRUP-----------------------------------
      2 c  Honey                               2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Water                               1 tb Lemon juice
 
  *Note: Nuts may be walnuts, almonds, pecans, pistachios or any combination.
  
  Defrost filo to room temperature at least 2 hours before using.  Mix
  filling in a bowl and set aside.  Melt butter in a small pan, and return to
  heat when it cools and doesn't flow easily while you are working with filo.
  
  Smooth 3 sheets of filo flat on a cutting board.  With a pastry brush,
  dribble warm butter between sheets.  Sprinkle 2/3 cup of nut filling over
  top, spreading to corners. Lay another 3 sheets of filo over filling,
  buttering between them.  Fold edges over on each side to keep nuts from
  rolling out.  Starting with the end nearest to you, roll away from you as
  tightly as you can.  Cut into 1" slices.  Place each roll in oiled pan,
  next to each other, snugly, nuts facing upwards.  Continue using all the
  filo and filling.  When all the slices are in the pan, dribble a teaspoon
  of warm butter on top of each slice.  It will disappear into the layers of
  nutmeats.
  
  Bake at 350 F for 45 minutes.  Begin making syrup 20 minutes before the
  pastry is ready to be taken out of the oven.  Pour hot syrup over rolls
  immediately upon removal from oven.  Use a spoon to ladle it over each one.
  Set aside to absorb syrup for 4 hours.  Do not refrigerate.

      Title: Htipiti Tirosalata (Mashed Cheese Salad)
 Categories: Appetizers, Greek
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Tsouskes                            1 lb Feta cheese
           Oil for frying peppers              3 tb Oil (olive, what else? K.M.)
 
  Tsouskes are hot spicy peppers.  Of course the best is green long peppers
  which grow only in Macedonia are extremely hot and very tasty.
  
  You fry them in oil, you peel their skin and you chop them into very small
  pieces. How many it depends on how hot they are and how spicy you can eat.
  After, you cut about 1 pound of feta in to small pieces and you mix it with
  the peppers. Add about 3 table spoons of olive oil. Work all the
  ingredients with the fork until it becomes a paste. Be careful: I said with
  fork. Not with food processor, not with goudhi. Just FORK. :)
  
  You are all set. Enjoy with bread or crackers as appetizer.

  Htipiti (pronounced h-tee-pee-TEE and translated as "that which is beaten")
  is the name Macedonians gave to this tart feta spread.  The longer it is
  beaten, the more tart it will be.
  
  In medium-size bowl, mash feta with fork or potato masher and slowly add
  olive oil, chopped peppers, oregano, and black pepper.  Pulverize mixture
  for about 10 minutes (less if using a food processor), pouring in lemon
  juice a little at a time, until feta is creamy.  Cover and refrigerate at
  least 1 hour before serving.  Yields about 1 cup.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 c  Dried chick-peas                    2    Garlic cloves
    1/4 ts Baking soda                       1/2 ts Ground coriander (optional)
      2 ts Tahini (or more)                  1/2 ts Ground cumin (optional)

    1/4 c  Olive oil                      
 
  Wash the chick-peas, then soak overnight with the baking soda in cold water
  to cover.  The following day, drain and wash the chick-peas, then cover
  with fresh water.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until
  tender, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.  Drain and push through sieve or food mill,
  discarding the coarse fibers remaining in the sieve.
  
  Meanwhile, put the tahini in a small bowl and beat it with the 1/3 cup
  water until dissolved, using a whisk or fork.  Beating briskly with the
  whisk, add the tahini mixture, a teaspoonful at a time, to the chick-peas,
  alternating with the lemon juice and olive oil.  When all has been added,
  crush the garlic over the mixture and sprinkle with optional spices, salt,
  pepper, and 1 tablespoon chopped parsley.  Beat for another minute, then
  taste for seasonings and chill overnight - if possible.  Serve cold,
  sprinkled with additional chopped parsley.  Makes about 2 cups.

      1 c  Water                          
 
      In a meat grinder, coarsely grind the pork, beef, and pork fat, in
  batches. Add all remaining ingredients, except the casings. Mix well and
  allow to sit while you clean the casings.
      Rinse the casings thoroughly in cold water and run fresh water through
  them. Drain.
      Using a sausage machine, a KitchenAid with a sausage attatchment, or a
  sausage funnel, fill the casings and tie them off into about 16" lengths.
  Do not fill them too tightly as they must have room to expand when they
  cook.
      Hang the sausages in a home style smoker and smoke them for abour 1
  hour. Do not allow the temperature of the smoker to go above 150 F.
      Remove the sausages and hang over a stick or dowel. Put the stick in a
  cool place and position an electric fan so that it will blow directly on
  the sausages. Allow them to dry for 2 days. They are they ready for use.
      Place them in the refrigerator, where they will keep well for about a
  week.

      Title: Icelandic Snowflake Breads (Laufabraud)
 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  All purpose flour                   1 tb Melted butter
      1 ts Baking powder                       2 c  Milk, heated to boiling
      1 tb Sugar                          
 
  hot fat for frying powdered sugar (optional)
  
  In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and sugar.  Mix in the butter and
  hot milk until a stiff dough is formed.  Turn out onto a lightly oiled
  surface and knead until smooth and cooled. Divide dough into four parts.
  Shape each into a ball.  Divide each into 4 parts to make 16, then divide
  each of the resulting balls into 2 parts to total 32.
  
  Cover baking sheets with waxed paper and dust the waxed paper lightly with
  flour.
  
  On a lightly floured surface, roll out each part of dough to make a thin
  round about 8 inches in diameter.  Place the rounds on the floured waxed
  paper.  Chill 30 minutes.
  
  In a skillet, heat 2 inches of fat to 375 to 400 degrees F. Vegetable
  shortening or corn or peanut oil may be used but the authentic fat is lard.
  
  Fold gthe dough rounds, one at the time, into quarters, and, with a
  sharp-tipped knife, make little cuts and cut-outs in the dough. Fry the
  bread rounds, until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side. Remove and
  drain on paper toweling.  Store in an airtight container in a cool place or
  in the freezer until ready to serve.

      Title: Imam Bayaldi (Eggplant Stuffed with Aromatics)
 Categories: Greek, Vegetarian, Vegetables
      Yield: 5 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      8    Tomatoes, sliced
  2 1/2 lb Eggplants                         1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
           Salt                                4    Garlic cloves, peeled and
      3 md Onions, peeled and sliced                - sliced
    1/2 c  Water                                    Freshly ground pepper
      5 tb Olive oil                           1 pn Granulated sugar
      5    Fresh tomatoes, peeled and               Fresh parsley for garnish
           - sliced, or: canned plum      
 
  *Note: 8 canned plum tomatoes, sliced, may be substituted for the 5 fresh.
  
  Wash the eggplants, cut off the stem end if using large ones and cut in
  half lengthwise.  With the tip of a sharp knife, make at least 3 lengthwise
  slashes on the cut sides of the eggplants, being careful not to pierce the
  skin on the opposite side.   Sprinkle with salt and let stand for 30
  minutes.  Rinse with cold water, dry, and invert to drain.
  
  Meanwhile, put the onions in a small pan with the 1/2 cup water and simmer
  a few minutes.  Drain and discard the water or save for soup.
  
  In a medium frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and saute the onions
  until soft, then put approximately a third of them in the bottom of a
  buttered casserole large enough to accomodate all the eggplants. Set 4 to 5
  tomato slices over the onions in the casserole and add the rest of the
  tomatoes to the onion remaining in the frying pan. Saute onions and
  tomatoes for 10 minutes, then stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the parsley
  and remove from the heat.  Set the eggplants into the casserole, tuck a
  slice of garlic into each eggplant slash, and stuff the slashes with the
  filling, allowing some to cover the top of the eggplant.  Season lightly
  with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar, then dribble the remaining oil and
  chopped parsley over the eggplants.  Cover the casserole with a lid or
  aluminum foil and bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to 40 minutes,
  until fork-tender, removing the cover during the last 10 minutes, to allow
  the sauce to thicken.  Garnish with parsley and serve warm.
  
  Note: This is excellent as a first course of a subsequently light meal
  topped with fresh fruit and Turkish coffee.
  
  If you wish, you may leave the eggplants whole, slash one side and remove
  some of the pulp with a small spoon.  This pulp is then sauteed with the
  filing and stuffed into the eggplant, a very attractive method for the
  smaller eggplants.  As you might suspect, both variations may also be
  prepared on top of the stove.

  quickly swirl batter so that it covers entire bottom of pan. Cover skillet
  with tight-fitting lid and cook over high heat until bread is spongy and
  moist (it will have air holes), about 1 minute (do not brown bottom as

  " This is the national bread of Ethiopia and is served with almost every
  meal. It is usually torn into pieces and used to scoop up food. Its faintly
  sour but soothing taste cools off the hot spicy dishes it accompanies. "

      1 ts Baking powder                       3 c  Flour
 
  Mix the flour with necessary warm water to make dough like bread. Add the
  butter, salt, and baking powder. Knead and put aside.
  
  Place in a bowl the ricotta cheese and the sugar and mix by hand. Add the
  honey and a handful of flour. Break and add the eggs and half the cinnamon,
  and mix well.
  
  Butter a pan and with a rolling pin roll out the dough to the size of round
  pan letting the dough over the edges. Spread the mixture over the dough and
  bake in 350 degree preheated oven for about 30 minutes. When ready sprinkle
  the rest of the cinnamon. Plan the amount of dough so the whole bread will
  be about 2 inches in height. Cut in diamond sections.

 Categories: Breads, Italian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/4 c  Sugar                             1/3 c  Chopped blanched almonds.
      1 ts Salt                              1/2 ts Anise seed
      1 pk Dry yeast                           2 tb Melted shortening
  2 1/2    To 3-1/2 cups unbleached            5    Uncooked eggs colored with
           -flour                                   -Easter Egg Dye
    2/3 c  Milk                                     ICING:
      2 tb Butter                              1 c  Confectioner's sugar
      2    Eggs, at room temperature           1 tb Milk
    1/2 c  Mixed candied fruit               1/8 ts Vanilla
 
  colored sprinkles
  
  In a large mixing bowl, blend the sugar, salt, and yeast well with 1 cup of
  the flour.  In a saucepan, combine milk and butter, heating slowly until
  liquid is warm and butter is melted.  Pour the milk into the dry
  ingredients and beat 125 strokes with a wooden spoon.  Add eggs and 1/2 cup
  flour or enough to make a thick batter.  beat vigorously for 2 minutes.
  
  Then stir in enough flour to make a ball of dough that draws away from the
  sides of the bowl.  Turn out onto a floured board and knead for about 10
  minutes, working in additional flour to overcome stickiness.  Place the
  dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease the top.  Cover tightly with
  plastic wrap and put in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk
  about 1 hour.  Meanwhile, combine the fruit,nuts, and anise seed.  Punch
  down the dough and return it to a lightly floured board.  Knead in the
  fruit mixture, keeping the syrupy pieces dusted with flour until they are
  worked into the dough.  Divide the dough in half.  Carefully roll each
  piece into a 24 inch rope - the fruit and nuts will make this slightly
  difficult.  Loosely twist the two ropes together and form a ring on a
  greased baking sheet.  Pinch the ends together well.  Brush the dough with
  melted shortening.  Push aside the twist to make a place for each egg.
  
  Push eggs down carefully as far as possible.  Cover the bread with wax
  paper and let rise in a warm,draft-free place until double in bulk, about 1
  hour.  Bake the bread in a preheated 350 F oven for about 35 minutes or
  until a toothpick inserted in a twist comes out clean.  Place on a wire
  rack to cool. Once the bread is cool, drizzle the icing on top between the
  eggs, and decorate with colored sprinkles.  Makes 1 loaf.

  [We made these, and they turned out just fine.  They're really an appetizer
  or part of a varied buffet - don't try to use them as the entire meal!
  They're too strongly flavored for that, and you'll be sick of them by the
  time you've had 6 or 10.  Definitely save this for when you're
  entertaining, not just deciding what's for dinner tonight.]

      1 c  Dry white wine (maybe Soave)             -beards removed
 
  Serves 8
  
  (don't leave these out they are cheap, tasty and attractive) You can buy a
  1/4 or 1/2 lb. of several items.  Even if shrimp is $6 per lb. 1/4 lb. is
  affordable and will add flavor and variety.
  
  Chopped parsley for garnish
  
  Saute the leeks, onions, celery, garlic and mushrooms until the onions are
  clear. Add the stock, nectar or water, tomato sauce and white wine. Bring
  to a heavy simmer and taste. Add the cayenne pepper and salt to taste.
  
  Prepare the seafood and add to the pot, remembering to add first those
  things which take longest to cook. The various shellfish go in with the
  shells on.
  
  Simmer until done. Serve in large bowls over spaghetti. By adding extra
  fish such as a lobster per person this will become a meal instead of a
  soup.

      Title: Jeff's Favorite Pizza Sauce
 Categories: Sauces, Italian, Pizza
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     28 oz Canned Progresso Plum               1 ts Oregano, heaping
           Tomatoes w/Basil, drained         3/4 ts Garlic powder
     12 oz Tomato paste                      1/8 c  Parmesan cheese
    1/2 ts Salt                                1 ts Light brown sugar
    1/4 ts Pepper                              2 ts Olive oil
    1/4 ts Onion powder                   
 
  This sauce has a quality similar to restaurant flavor, but being freshly
  made seems to take on a better flavor.
  
    Puree the drained tomatoes well.  It is important to use Italian Plum
  Tomatoes, not regular canned tomatoes.  The flavor is distinctively
  different.  If you cannot find Progresso Plum Tomatoes with basil, add 1/2
  ts. basil to the tomatoes.
  
    Place the puree mixture in heavy saucepan.  Add remaining ingredients
  except for the grated cheese and brown sugar.  Simmer 1/2 hour, or longer
  if necessary.  Add cheese and brown sugar last 10 minutes of cooking. The
  canned grated parmesan is good in this recipe, as well as fresh.
  
    Sauce can be frozen if needed.
  
  Enjoy! - Jeff Duke

      Title: Jeff's Pizza Sauce
 Categories: Sauces, Italian, Pizza
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     56 oz (2-28 oz cans) Italian Plum         1 tb Tarragon
           Tomatoes, drained                   1 ts Salt
      6 oz Tomato paste (small can)            1 tb Garlic powder
      2 tb Olive oil                           1 tb Basil
      2 tb Corn syrup                        1/2 ts Onion powder

  2 1/2 tb Oregano                        
 
  If you don't like small bits of tomato in the sauce, puree the whole
  tomatoes in the blender first.  Otherwise, chop them as the mixture cooks.
  
  Mix all ingredients, except oregano, in large saucepan.  Simmer for 30
  minutes, then add oregano.  Cook additional 15 minutes.
  
  Sauce is best if cooked then chilled, overnight, in the refrigerator.
  
  To Use:  Prepare basic pizza dough.  Spoon sauce onto crust out to rims,
  cover with thick layer of mozzarella cheese.  Top with meat and vegetable
  toppings, then cover again with mozzarella and parmesan (or romano)
  cheeses. All cheeses are best if freshly grated.

           -mixture with the hand and      5 1/2    Inch slices.
 
  Here's the basics, fillings follow in the next messages.
  
  DOUGH:
  
  Place in an oiled baking sheet cut side down.  Press down lightly to
  flatten. Or you can cut the rolled dough in 3- inch circles. Place a
  tablespoon of the filling on each; draw the edges together and pinch
  firmly.  Place on an oiled baking sheet, pinched edges up
  
  In either case, bake in a 375 degree oven 35 minutes or until browned.
  Makes about 24.
  
  FILLINGS FOR KNISHES
  
  POTATO: 1 cup chopped onions 6 tablespoons chicken fat or butter 2 cups
  mashed potatoes 1 egg 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper
  
  Brown the onions in the fat or butter. Beat in the potatoes, egg, salt and
  pepper until fluffy.
  
  CHEESE 1 1/2 cups diced scallions or onions 4 tablespoons butter 2 cups pot
  cheese 1 egg 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/8 teaspoon pepper 2 tablespoons sour
  cream
  
  Scallions are better than onions for this, so try to get them. Brown the
  scallions in the butter and beat in the cheese, egg, salt, pepper and sour
  cream until smooth.
  
  MEAT: 1/2 cup minced onions 2 tablespoons chicken fat 1 1/2 cups ground
  cooked meat 1/2 cup cooked rice 1 egg 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper
  
  Lightly brown the onions in the fat. Add the meat, rice, egg, salt and
  pepper, mixing until smooth.
  
  CHICKEN 1 1/2 cups ground cooked chicken 3/4 cup mashed potatoes 1 egg, 1
  teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper
  
  Mix all the ingredients until smooth.
  
  And finally, the classic:
  
  POTATO-DOUGH KNISHES
  
  1/4 cup minced onions 6 tablespoons chicken fat or butter 4 cups mashed
  potatoes 1/2 cup potato flour 3 eggs 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper
  
  Brown the onions in 4 tablespoons chicken fat or butter.  Cool.
  
  Knead together the remaining fat or butter, the pota- toes, potato flour,
  eggs, salt and pepper. Break off pieces (about 2 inches long) and flatten
  slightly. Place a tea- spoon of browned onions on each and cover by

      Title: Joululimppa (Finnish Holiday Rye Bread)
 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Buttermilk                               Grated rind of 1 orange
    1/2 c  Molasses                            1 c  Rye flakes or wheat germ
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine                 2 c  Dark or light rye flour
      2 ts Salt                            3 1/2    To 4 1/2 cups uncleached
      1 ts Fennel seeds                             -white or whole wheat flour
      1 ts Caraway seeds                            Glaze:
      2 tb Dry yeast                           1 tb Molasses
    1/2 c  Warm water                          2 tb Water
 
  Similar to Swedish rye.  Can be toasted.
  
  Heat the buttermilk, molasses, butter or margarine, salt, fennel seeds, and
  caraway seeds until the butter melts.  Set aside to cool.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Let it stand for 5 minutes until the
  yeast bubbles.  ((My comment: whisk in some flour and molasses to nourish
  the yeast.))  Add the yeast to the cooled buttermilk mixture along with the
  grated orange rind, rye flakes or wheat germ, and rye flour.  Beat well
  until smooth. Add 3 to 3 1/2 cups of wheat flour, stirring in a cup at a
  time, until the dough will not readily absorb more flour.  The dough will
  be rough.
  
  Flour a work surface with the remaining wheat flour and turn the dough out
  onto it.  Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15 minutes.
  (The gluten in rye is more fragile than in wheat.  It needs a resting time
  to recuperate and reform and does not require as vigorous or lengthy a
  kneading).
  
  Gently knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth.  Form the dough
  into a ball and place it in a large buttered bowl or pot, turning it to
  coat all sides with butter.  Cover it and let it rise, in a warm spot,
  until doubled in size, about an hour.
  
  Punch down the dough and gently knead it for one minute.  Form the dough
  into three round loaves and place in lightly buttered 9-inch cake pans or
  on buttered baking sheets.  Cover and let rise until almost doubled in
  size, 45 minutes to an hour.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Combine the water and molasses, brush the
  tops with half of this mixture to glaze. Then lightly pierce the loaves all
  over with a fork.
  
  Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the bread sopunds hollow when tapped on
  the bottom.  While the bread is hot, brush it with the remaining glaze.
  Remove the loaves from the pans and cool on racks.
  
  Yields 3 loaves.

  BASIL PASTA DOUGH:
  
  Parmesan cheese, grated
  
  Pasta Dough:  In food processor (or blender), puree basil, eggs, oil, and
  salt.  (If using blender, pour into bowl; stir in enough flour to make
  stiff dough.) Add 1 1/2 cups flour to processor; process for 5 seconds.
  With motor running, add enough flour so dough forms a ball. Turn dough out
  onto lightly floured surface, and knead for a few minutes until smooth and
  elastic, adding flour as necessary.  If dough was not mixed in food
  processor, knead for about 5 minutes.  Cut dough in half and shape into
  balls.  Cover dough with inverted bowl; rest for 1/2 hour.
  
  Veal Filling:  Heat oil in skillet; add veal, onion, and garlic. Saute
  until veal is cooked and moisture has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Remove
  from heat; cool slightly.  In food processor, process meat to a paste. Mix
  in eggs, cheese, and parsley; cool.
  
  Tomato Sauce:  Heat Oil in skillet or large saucepan over medium heat.
  Saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent.  Stir in tomato puree
  and remaining sauce ingredients.  Simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Cover;
  keep warm until ready to use.
  
  Ravioli:  On floured surface, roll half of dough into a 12-by-16 inch
  rectangle; set aside on a towel.  Roll other half; score into 12 (4- inch)
  squares.  Mound filling in center of squares.  Brush water on scored lines;
  lay other rectangle of pasta on top.  Press, with fingers, around filling
  to seal.  Use pastry wheel or knife to cut between the mounds. In a large
  saucepan, bring 2 quarts water and 1 tablespoon oil to a boil. Add ravioli;
  cook gently for 5 to 7 minutes, or until edges are tender. Remove with
  slotted utensil (spoon or spatula).  Serve with tomato sauce and cheese.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: Kadaifi
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 16 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                           Ground cinnamon
      1 lb Commercial raw kadaifi dough      1/2 c  Orange juice (optional)
    1/2 c  Sweet butter; melted                2 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  Finely chopped almonds *          1/2 c  Honey
  3 1/2 c  Granulated sugar                    2 tb Lemon juice
 
  *Note: Use blanched almonds.
  
  Open the raw kadaifi dough to the air for 10 to 15 minutes.  Spread half
  the pastry evenly over the bottom of a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and brush
  with half the butter.  Meanwhile, combine the almonds, 1/2 cup sugar, 1
  tablespoon cinnamon, and orange juice in a small bowl.  (The orange juice
  will make the mixture like a paste that can be spread with a knife.) Spread
  the almond mixture over the kadaifi and cover with the remaining dough.
  Brush with the remaining butter and bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 40
  minutes or slightly longer, until golden on top.
  
  Meanwhile, boil the remaining 3 cups sugar with water for 5 minutes.  Stir
  in the honey and lemon juice, bring to a boil and keep hot.  When done,
  remove the pastry to a rack to cool in the pan, then spoon the hot syrup
  over the pastry.  Cover with a dry towel and allow to cool thoroughly. When
  cool, cut into square or diamond shapes of any desired size.  Dust with
  additional ground cinnamon just before serving on dessert plates.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
    750 g  Finely ground lean lamb             1 ts Finely chopped dill
           -OR- finely ground lean beef             Salt
      1 c  Boiled rice                              Freshly ground black pepper
      1 md Onion; finely chopped               2 lg Eggs
    1/2 c  Crumbled beyaz peynir                    Plain flour; for coating
           -(feta cheese)                           Oil; for shallow frying
    1/4 c  Finely chopped parsley         
 
  The Turks' appreciation of the fair sex is apparent even in the naming of
  recipes.  Form the meat mixture with a certain voluptousness to an
  elongated egg shape.  Don't make them too plump - we all like to be
  flattered, don't we?
  
  Cooking time: about 20-25 minutes in all
  
  Combine meat, boiled rice, onion and cheese, then pass through meat grinder
  using fine screen.  Add herbs, salt and pepper to taste and 1 lightly
  beaten egg.  Mix by hand to a smooth paste.
  
  Take a generous tablespoon of the mixture and form into an elongated egg
  shape, wider at one end than the other, or into simpler torpedo shape.
  Moisten hand with water to facilitate handling.  Place kadin budu into
  baking dish side by side as they are finished.
  
  Beat remaining egg well and pour over kadin budu, then turn them over in a
  dish to coat them evenly with a film of egg.
  
  Place about 1/2 cup flour in a plate and roll budu in flour, one at a time,
  placing them into a frying pan of heated oil as they are coated. Use one
  hand for rolling them in the flour, keep other hand dry for moving them to
  the pan.
  
  Fry over high heat until golden brown, turning them frequently with tongs
  so that they keep their shape.
  
  Drain on paper towels and serve hot with vegetable or salad accompaniment.

      Title: Kadin Gobegi (Ladies' Navels)
 Categories: Desserts, Ethnic
      Yield: 20 servings
 
-----------------------------------SYRUP-----------------------------------
      2 c  Granulated sugar                  1/2    Lemon; strained juice only
  1 1/2 c  Water                         

--------------------------------CHOUX PASTRY--------------------------------
      1 c  Plain flour                       1/4 c  Butter
    1/4 ts Salt                                2 lg Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 c  Water                             1/8 ts Almond essence

---------------------------------TO FINISH---------------------------------
           Oil; for shaping and frying       1/4 c  Blanched pistachio nuts
           Whipped cream or kaymak                  -(finely chopped)
           -(kaymak is clotted cream)     
 
  The name and finished dish are colourfully Turkish, while the basic dough
  is very definitely French.  Though the ingredient proportions differ from
  the traditional formula, it is choux pastry nonetheless, prepared in the
  Turkish manner.
  
  In a heavy pan dissolve sugar in water over medium heat, stirring
  occasionally.  Bring to the boil, add lemon juice and boil rapidly, without
  stirring, for 15 minutes.  Leave syrup in pan to cool.
  
  Sift flour and salt onto a square of stiff paper.
  
  In another heavy pan heat water and butter until boiling.  Pour in flour
  all at once, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or balloon whisk. Keep
  stirring until mixture leaves sides of pan, then cook on low heat, stirring
  occasionally, for further 5 minutes.  Remove roux from heat and turn into a
  bowl.  Cool for 2 minutes then gradually beat in eggs.  Add almond essence
  and beat until smooth and satiny.  A balloon whisk will break up lumps, a
  wooden spoon is better for beating to a smooth finish, so utilize the two
  for the process.
  
  Oil hands and take pieces of dough the size of a walnut.  Roll into smooth
  balls and place on an oiled tray.  Flatten into rounds about 5 cm (2
  inches) in diameter and press oiled forefinger into centre of each to make
  a hole.  Keep hands oiled during shaping so that dough will not stick.
  
  Place enough oil in a large electric frypan to come to a depth of 1 cm (1/2
  inch).  Heat until just warm and place half of the prepared gobegi into
  oil.  Increase heat to 200øC (400øF) as soon as they are added.  When
  gobegi rise to the surface and are puffed, turn them over. Fry them for 15
  minutes in all, timed from when the gobegi are first placed into pan. Turn
  frequently during last half of cooking time so that they brown evenly.
  
  When cooked, remove from oil with a slotted spoon and drain briefly on
  paper towels.  Put into syrup, turn them and leave for 5 minutes before
  removing to a plate.
  
  Turn off frypan and allow oil to cool before adding second lot.
  
  To serve, arrange gobegi on a flat platter and place a dollop of whipped
  cream or kaymak in the center.  Sprinkle with pistachio nuts.
  
  NOTE: If you have no electric frypan, use a large frying pan set on a
  thermostatically controlled hot plate or burner.  Otherwise use an ordinary
  burner, start at low and increase heat to midway between medium and high
  settings.
  
  Variation: Dilber Dudagi (Lips of the Beauty) Follow above directions, but
  flatten the balls of dough in your hand to a 6 cm (2-1/2 inch) round and
  fold dough over so that pastry resembles lips on curved edge. Place on an
  oiled tray until all are shaped.  Fry and finish as for Kadin Gobegi. Serve
  plain or with whipped cream or kaymak.

  Make the cheese filling by beating cottage cheese, pot cheese, 1 egg and
  sugar together.  Combine the flour and milk with the 3 eggs.  Beat to make
  a smooth batter.
  
  Heat a 6- or 8-inch skillet.  Coat with vegetable oil and pour in 2 to 3
  tablespoons of the batter.  Tilt the pan to distribute the batter over the
  bottom of the skillet.  Cook until the dough is firm and browned.
  
  Remove from the pan and place on a lightly-oiled plate with browned side
  up. Spoon 1 tablespoon of filling onto the edge of the pancake. Roll up by
  bringing the edge with the filling to the center of the pancake, fold in
  each side, and fold over once more to make a sealed pouch. Continue with
  the rest of the batter.
  
  When ready to serve, heat the margarine in a skillet.  Fry the blintzes
  until golden brown on all sides. Serve with yogurt.

  snapper, rockfish, whiting, etc.)
  
  In a soup pot with a wide bottom, saute the onions in the oil, without
  browning, until soft.  Add the tomatoes, fennel, herbs, wine, and water and
  bring to a boil.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and simmer for 45
  minutes.  Pour the stock into a large bowl through a sieve, squeezing all
  the pulp from the vegetables before discarding the fibers remaining in the
  sieve.  Return the soup stock to the pot and bring to a boil.
  
  Meanwhile, lightly salt the fish and let stand for 10 minutes, then rinse
  with water and lower into soup, adding water only if needed to cover the
  fish.  Lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, then add the lobster. Cover
  and simmer 5 minutes longer, then add the shrimp and scallops or mussels
  and simmer an additional 10 minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasonings.
  
  Arrange the toast slices in large soup plates.  Serve the varied fishes and
  broth in each bowl, hot, with croutons in a separate plate.
  
  NOTE: Kakavia is frequently made in the following variation: Cook 2 to 3
  fish with the vegetables and strain with the vegetables to make a thicker
  stock.  Continue to cook the remaining seafood as described above.

      Title: Kalitsounia Me Kanella (Cretan Cheese-Cinnamon Pastries)
 Categories: Greek, Cookies
      Yield: 20 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      4 tb Milk (or more)
  1 1/2 c  Fresh mizithra or ricotta           2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Grated hard ricotta                 1 pn Salt
      2    Eggs; separated                     1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar                         Confectioners' sugar
      2 tb Butter; melted                 
 
  For the filling, combine the cheeses, lightly beaten egg yolks, sugar, 1/2
  teaspoon cinnamon, and melted butter in a bowl. The mixture should be thick
  enough to mound, but not stiff; add 1 tablespoon milk, if necessary.  Set
  aside while you make the dough.
  
  Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, then cut in the butter and mix by
  rubbing between your fingers.  Mix in the vanilla, egg whites, and enough
  milk to make a soft dough.  Knead until smooth and elastic, then break off
  small pieces and roll as thin of a dime.  (The dough will be elastic and
  can be rolled easily.)  Cut into circles 4-inches in diameter (teacup
  size), then on each circle place a teaspoon of the cheese filling.  Wet the
  circle edge with water or milk and fold over to form a half-moon, then seal
  with the tines of a fork or pastry wheel.  Arrange the Kaltisounia on
  buttered cookie sheets and bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes,
  or until the pastry puffs up and turns a light chestnut color.  Remove from
  the oven, and place on racks, and dust with confectioners' sugar and
  cinnamon.  Serve hot or cold.

           (7 oz)                         
 
  This refers to dumplings made from boiled potatoes which is the traditional
  Swabian method.  Dumplings made from raw potatoes originated in Bavaria and
  reached Swabian kitchens relatively late.
  
  Beat the butter and egg until fluffy.  Add the cold, grated, boiled
  potatoes, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper, and knead well. Depending on how
  watery the potatoes are, flour may be substituted for the bread crumbs in
  order to get a dough that is neither too firm not to pasty.
  
  Form dumplings, and cook in barely simmering salted water for 15 minutes.
  
  Serve immediately, while still piping hot.
  
  These dumplings are also very popular as a main dish, with brown gravy.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: Kataifi (Shredded Nut Pastries)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 40 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1 c  Butter; melted
    500 g  Kataifi pastry                

--------------------------------NUT FILLING--------------------------------
      1 c  Coarsely ground walnuts           1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 c  Coarsely ground almonds             1    Egg white; lightly beaten
    1/2 c  Caster sugar                        1 tb Brandy
      1 ts Ground cinnamon               

-----------------------------------SYRUP-----------------------------------
      2 c  Sugar                               4    Cloves
  1 1/2 c  Water                               1    Piece cinnamon bark
      1 ts Lemon juice                         1 tb Honey
      1    Thin strip of lemon rind       
 
  Makes: 40 pieces Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 50-55
  minutes
  
  Take an eighth of the pastry strands and spread out on a board to a 18 x 25
  cm (7 x 10 inch) rectangle with strands running roughly lengthwise. Using a
  pastry brush, dab some butter over strands.  Combine nut filling
  ingredients and spread about 2 tablespoons of filling along one narrow
  edge.  Roll up firmly into a neat roll.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.
  Place rolls close together in a 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 inch) slab cake pan or
  baking dish.  Brush top with remaining butter.  Bake in a moderate oven,
  one shelf above centre, for 50-55 minutes until golden brown.
  
  Meanwhile, dissolve sugar in water over heat, add lemon juice and rind,
  cloves and cinnamon.  Bring to the boil and boil over medium heat for 10
  minutes.  Stir in honey, strain and cool.  Pour cooled syrup over hot
  pastries and place a folded cloth on top.  Leave until cool.  Cut each roll
  into 5 pieces diagonally if preferred.
  
  ALTERNATIVE SHAPING:  Take a small handful of pastry strands and spread out
  fairly compactly on board.  Have strands running towards you as much as
  possible and dab with butter.  Mould a tablespoon of nut filling into a
  short sausage shape and place on one end.  Roll up firmly into a neat roll
  and place in baking dish.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.  Makes about
  30 rolls each about 5 cm (2 inches) long.  Bake as directed above, prepare
  syrup and finish as in previous recipe.

      Title: Kataifi Me Krema (Shredded Pastry with Custard)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                

------------------------------CUSTARD FILLING------------------------------
      4 c  Milk                                1 pn Salt
    3/4 c  Cornflour                         1/2 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs; beaten                        1 ts Vanilla essence

-------------------------------KATAIFI CRUST-------------------------------
    500 g  Kataifi (shredded pastry)         3/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted

-----------------------------------SYRUP-----------------------------------
      2 c  Sugar                               1    Piece of cinnamon bark
  1 1/2 c  Water                               3 ts Lemon juice
      1    Thin strip lemon rind          
 
  Oven temperature: 190 C (375 F) Cooking time: 1 hour
  
  Combine milk and cornflour in a heavy pan.  Blend in beaten eggs and add
  salt and sugar.  Place over medium heat and stir constantly until thickened
  and bubbling.  Remove from heat, stir in vanilla essence and cover top of
  custard with buttered paper to prevent a skin forming.
  
  Place kataifi in a large bowl and gently separate strands with fingers.
  Grease a 20 x 28 cm (8 x 11 inch) oven dish with some of the butter.  Put
  half the kataifi in the base, pressing it down to make it compact. Drizzle
  1/4 cup butterr evenly over it.  Pour custard filling over kataifi,
  spreading it evenly.  Top with remaining kataifi.  Spread evenly and pat
  down gently.  Pour remaining melted butter evenly over top.  Bake in a
  moderately hot oven for 45 minutes until golden brown.  Remove from oven
  and leave until cool.
  
  Dissolve sugar in water over medium heat, add lemon rind and cinnamon bark
  and bring to the boil.  Add lemon juice and boil over medium heat for 15
  minutes, skimming when necessary.  Do not stir once syrup is boiling.
  Strain hot syrup over cooled pastry.  Leave until cold and cut into diamond
  shapes to serve.
  
  Note: The previous recipe is the traditional way in which this dessert is
  made.  As the custard and syrup soften the kataifi, many good cooks use the
  following method for a crisp finish:
  
  Prepare the syrup as directed above and leave until cool.  Place the
  kataifi in a bowl and loosen stands.  Pour on 1/2 cup melted, unsalted
  butter and mix with fingers to coat strands.  Spread kataifi in two
  buttered 20 x 28 cm (8 x 11 inch) straight-sided oven dishes and press down
  to make it compact.  Bake in a moderately hot oven for 20-25 minutes until
  golden - take care that it does not become too brown.  Remove from the oven
  and pour cooled syrup evenly over hot kataifi in each dish. Cover each dish
  with a tea towel so that kataifi softens slightly, otherwise it will be
  difficult to cut.  Make custard as directed in previous recipe and pour
  while hot onto kataifi in one dish.  Invert other dish of kataifi on top of
  the custard.  Leave uncovered until cool, then cut into diamond shapes to
  serve.

           - peeled, chopped fine            3/4 c  Heavy cream
  1 1/2 c  Flaked finnan haddie            1 1/2 ts Curry powder (or to taste)
           - freshened, boned, skinned,      1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
           - (or any smoked fish)                   Generous grindings of pepper

      3 c  Cooked basmati rice                      Lime wedges
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Put the eggs, fish and rice in a large mixing bowl;
  toss together lightly to mix. Put the cream in a small saucepan, add the
  curry powder and nutmeg, heat, stirring until the spices are blended. Add
  the cream mixture, pepper, and lemon juice to the rice mixture, and gently
  toss. Taste for salt and seasoning and adjust if needed (the dish won't
  need any salt if the smoked fish is salty). Put the Kedgeree in a casserole
  and heat in oven only until piping hot. Serve on a platter surrounding
  softly scrambled eggs, and garnished with lime wedges.
  
  NOTE: To freshen finnan haddie, soak it in cold milk for an hour, drain
  then poach it in fresh milk. The milk sweetens the fish and tames its
  saltiness.

      1 lg Carrot; parboiled, diced           16    Commercial filo sheets
      3 c  Parboiled white rice;drained        6 tb Butter (or more); melted
      2 tb Tomato puree                        3    Hard-boiled eggs; quartered
 
  On the island of Kefallinia in the Ionion Sea, the Feast Day of Analipseos
  (Ascension Day) is celebrated with the traditional "kreatopita" (meat-pie).
  This spicy pie also ushers in the beginning of Lent on the day of Apokreas.
  
  In a stock pot, cover the lamb bones with cold water. Simmer, covered for 1
  hour. Strain, boil down to 1 cup, and set aside. Sprinkle the lemon juice
  on the lamb cubes. Heat the oil or butter in a heavy pan, add the onions
  and lamb, and saute the meat on all sides until the onions are soft without
  browning. Pour the onions, lamb, and juices into a large bowl. Add the
  diced potatoes and carrot, rice, tomato puree, cheese, parsley, mint,
  oregano, garlic, cinnamon, and fruit peel and season with salt and freshly
  ground pepper. Add enough reserved lamb broth for liquid while pie bakes,
  then mix with a wooden spoon.
  
  Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 x 12 x 3 inch pan. Spread 8 filo sheets,
  brushing the melted butter in between the sheets, making sure the pastry
  fits the sides and bottom of the pan. Pour in the filling, spreading evenly
  with a spatula. Place the egg quarters here and there across the top and
  cover with the remaining filo sheets, brushing with butter as before. Flute
  the edges with two fingers or a fork and brush the top with butter. Using a
  sharp knife, score the top 3 filo sheets into square or diamond shapes, or
  prick the homemade pastry with a fork. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes in
  moderately slow oven (325 F), raising the temperature to 350 F during the
  last 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand on a rack for 15
  minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand on a rack for 15 minutes. Cut
  into diamonds or squares and serve warm.

    3/4 ts Salt                                     -, At Room Temperature
      1 lg Egg                                12 tb Unsalted (Sweet) Butter;
      3 tb Vegetable Oil                            - 1 1/2 Sticks, Melted

------------------------------RED BEAN FILLING------------------------------

-----------------------------NACHINKA IZ FASOLI-----------------------------
      1 c  Dried Red Beans; Soaked                  -Taste
           -Overnight In Water To Cover      1/4 c  Olive Oil
           Salt And Plenty Of Freshly      1 1/4 c  Onions; Finely Chopped
           -Ground Black Pepper; To          1/2 c  Cilantro; Finely Chopped
 
  Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the middle.
  Pour in the egg, oil, and club soda and stir into the flour, adding more
  club soda if necessary, ot make a rather soft dough.  Transfer the dough to
  a floured board and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Shape
  the dough into a ball, cover with a linen or cotton (not terry cloth)
  kitchen towel and let stand for 1 hour.  Divide the dough into four parts
  and shape each one into a ball.  Let stand, covered, for 15 minutes.
  Preheat the oven to 350 Degrees F. and butter two large baking sheets.  On
  a floured surface, roll out one of the balls into an 1/8-inch thick square.
  Brush the dough with some of the melted butter  Dip your fingers into the
  melted butter and pull the edges of the dough in different directions,
  stretching it evenly until it is almost transparently thin. Don't worry if
  the dough tears, as you will be folding it up.  With a sharp knife, trim
  the edges of the dough to from an even square.  Fold the square in half,
  brush the surface generously with the melted d fold in half again crosswise
  to from a smaller square.  It should be approximately 6 to 7 inches. It is
  isn't, pull it out slightly to fit the dimensions. Brush the square with
  butter.  Shape one-fourth of the filling into a ball and place in the
  center of the square.  Fold in the corners of the square like an envelope.
  With the palm of your hand, flatten the pie so it is about 1 inch thick.
  Brush the top with melted butter and carefully transfer to a prepared
  baking sheet.  Repeat the procedure with the rest of the dough and filling.
  Bake the pies in the middle of the oven, until golden brown, about 35
  minutes.  Serve warm.
  
  Makes 4 Pies for 8 Servings
  
  RED BEAN FILLING:
  
  Drain the beans and place them in a saucepan along with enough fresh water
  to cover by at least 2-inches.  Bring to a boil and add salt, then reduce
  the heat to medium-low.  Cook the beans, partially covered, until almost
  mushy, about 1 1/2 hours.  While the beans are cooking, heat the oil in a
  medium size skillet, over medium heat, and add the onion to saute it. Stir
  occasionally, until dark brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.  When the beans are
  done, drain well and mash.  Add the sauteed onions and their cooking fat
  and the cilantro.  Season generously with salt and freshly ground black
  pepper.  Cool to room temperature.
  
  Makes enough filling for 4 pies.

  Mix all the ingredients except the hard-boiled eggs and the margarine. Put
  half the mixture into a well-greased loaf pan (I found that I didn't need
  to oil the pan), then put the whole hard-boiled eggs in a row down the
  middle of the meat and cover with the remaining meat mixture.  Dab the top
  with margarine as desired:  a lot if the meat is lean, very little if it is
  fat.  Bake for 15 minutes in a 500 F. oven, then reduce the heat to 350 F.
  for about 45 minutes, until brown on top.  Serve warm or cold in thick
  slices so the egg centers each piece.

      Title: Knoepfle- Oder Spaetzleteig (Basic Spaetzle Dough)
 Categories: Pasta, German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    500 g  Flour (4 1/2 cups less 1            1 c  Water
           -Tbsp)                                   Salt
      5    Eggs                           
 
  Combine all ingredients and stir until the batter is smooth. One part at a
  time, force through a spaetzle shaver and let drop straight into boiling
  water.  As soon as the spaetzle rise to the surface, remove them with a
  slotted spoon and rinse in warm water.
  
  In olden days, the spaetzle dough was forced through a three- legged sieve,
  by means of stirring.  This resulted in the so- called 'Knoepfle' (little
  buttons).  Another method - more common in the Wuertemberg area - is to put
  the dough on a wooden board and scraping off small slivers of dough, which
  then results in elongated spaetzle, similar to the ones produced by a
  spaetzle press.
  
  Serves 4.

    1/2 c  Half and half cream                 1 lg Egg
      4 tb Unsalted butter                   1/8 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
    1/4 c  Minced white onions               1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
    1/3 lb Ground beef                       1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/3 lb Ground veal                    
 
  1.  Soak the bread crumbs in the half and half for 5 minutes in a large
  mixing bowl.
  
  2.  Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet over low to moderate
  heat. When the foam starts to subside, add the onions and saute them for
  about 2 minutes. Let cool slightly.
  
  3.  Add the beef, veal, pork, egg nutmeg, salt, pepper, and onions to the
  bread-crumb mixture. Gently combine the ingredients with your hands.
  
  4.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for a couple of hours.
  
  5.  Shape the meat mixture with your hands into uniform 2/3-inch balls.
  Arrange them on a plate in one layer so they do not touch each other. Let
  the meatballs stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
  
  6.  Melt the remaining butter in a saute pan or skillet over moderate heat.
  When the foam starts to subside, add the meatballs. (Do not crowd the pan;

  batches and keep the cooked ones warm in a preheated 200 degree F oven.)
  Saute the meatballs for about 5 minutes until they become brown on all
  sides. Turn them as necessary, but do so gently.

      Title: Kolache Cookies
 Categories: Cookies, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Flour                             1/2 lb Ground walnuts
      8 oz Cream cheese                        1    Egg white, beaten
    1/2 lb Butter                              1 c  Sugar or honey
      1    Egg                               1/2 ts Almond extract
      2 ts Sugar                             1/2 ts Vanilla extract
           Nut Filling                    
 
  Sift the flour and sugar together. Work in the butter, cream cheese and
  egg. Knead together. And easy way to do this is to put the dough inside a
  plastic bag - much less messy! Let the dough stand in the refrigerator
  overnight. About a half hour before you're ready to start making the
  cookies, put the dough into the freezer.
  
  For the filling, mix all of the above ingredients together.  You can also
  used canned poppy seed filling (Solo brand) or an apricot or prune filling.
  
  Spread flour and powdered sugar onto the surface where you will be rolling
  the dough. Roll the dough out thin. Cut into squares about 2 inches on each
  side.  It's easiest to cut if you use a pizza cutter. Spread a small amount
  of filling (1/2 to 1 tsp) from one corner to the opposite corner. Don't
  fill them too much, or the filling will spill out when it is cooking. Fold
  the two remaining corners to the center, partially covering the filling.
  Wet your fingertip in a small bowl of water, and seal the edge, or it may
  open up during the cooking.
  
  Bake in a 375 degree oven for about 13 minutes.
  
  Makes 6 dozen small cookies.

  Beat until well blended.  Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft
  dough.  Turn out dough on a lightly floured surface.  Clean and grease
  bowl.  Knead dough until smooth and elastic.  Place dough in greased bowl,
  turning to coat all sides.
  
  Cover with a clean damp cloth;let rise in a warm place, free from drafts,
  until doubled in bulk. Preheat oven to 350 F.  Grease side and bottom of a
  10 inch springform pan.  Divide dough into thirds.  Using your hands,
  gently press 1/3 of dough evenly over bottom and side of pan.  Evenly
  spread Cheese Filling over doughlined pan.  On a lightly floured surface,
  roll out another 1/3 of dough to a 10 inch circle.  Place over Cheese
  Filling. Gently pat with your hands.  Using a pastry brush, lightly brush
  milk over top of dough.  Cut remaining 1/3 dough in 4 even pieces.  Shape 3
  pieces into long ropes.  Braid ropes; apply to outer edge of cake.  Using
  remaining dough, cut desired figures with various cutters of form shapes
  with your hands. Arrange figures on top of dough as desired.  Lightly brush
  with milk.  Bake 50 to 60 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool cake in pan
  5 minutes on a rack.  Remove pan side; cool completely on rack. Makes 1 (10
  inch) cake.
  
  Cheese Filling:  With a grinder or food processor, process cheese.  Do not
  puree or over process.  Place egg yolks, sugar and Vanilla Sugar in a large
  bowl.  Beat until pale and creamy, at least 10 minutes.  Add ground cheese,
  a little at a time, while beating.  Beat until smooth.

      Title: Kopenhai
 Categories: Greek, Cakes
      Yield: 30 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                

-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
    3/4 c  Butter                              2    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Sugar                           2 1/2 c  Flour
      1    Orange (grated rind only)           1 pn Salt

-------------------------------ALMOND FILLING-------------------------------
      6    Eggs; separated                   1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Caster sugar                        2 c  Ground almonds
    1/4 ts Almond essence                      1 pn Salt
    1/4 c  Plain flour                   

------------------------------TO FINISH TORTE------------------------------
      8    Fillo pastry sheets                 1    Thin strip orange rind
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted             1    Thin strip lemon rind
      2 c  Granulated sugar                    2 ts Lemon juice
      1 c  Water                               2    Pieces cinnamon bark
 
  Cream butter and sugar with grated orange rind until light and fluffy; beat
  in egg yolks.  Sift flour and salt into butter mixture to form a soft
  dough.
  
  Lightly grease a round 20 cm (12 inch) dish (a "tapsi") or a 25 x 30 cm (10
  x 12 inch) baking dish.  As pastry moulds easily any tears can be pressed
  together.  An alternative is to put pastry in dish without rolling, and
  press it over base and sides with fingers.  Even out by rolling with a
  straight-sided glass.
  
  Bake in a moderately hot oven for 15-20 minutes until lightly coloured.
  Remove and cool.
  
  To make almond filling, beat egg yolks, sugar and almond essence until
  thick and light.  Sift flour with baking powder and combine with ground
  almonds.  Fold this lightly into beaten egg yolks. Beat egg whites with
  salt until stiff but not dry and fold lightly into almond mixture.  Pour
  into pastry-lined dish.
  
  On a flat surface butter a fillo pastry sheet, top with another and butter.
  Continue until all sheets are used.  Leave a top sheet unbuttered. Lift
  onto top of almond filling and trim edges of fillo in line with pastry
  crust, using kitchen scissors.  Brush top with remaining butter. With a
  sharp knife or razor blade make slits through the top 2 or 3 sheets running
  the length of the dish and spacing them 4 cm (1 1/2 inches) apart.
  
  Bake in a moderate oven for 45 minutes until top is golden and filling is
  set.  Meanwhile dissolve sugar in water over medium heat, add fruit rinds,
  lemon juice and cinnamon bark and bring to the boil.  Boil for 10 minutes,
  strain and cool.  When torte is cooked, cut through slits in pastry down to
  the bottom crust.  Pour cooled syrup over hot torte, leave until cool. Cut
  diagonally to give diamond-shaped pieces for serving.

      Title: Kos Lemon Pie
 Categories: Greek, Pies, Desserts
      Yield: 12 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                

-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
      1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour        8 tb Unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar                     - cut into small pieces
    1/2 tb Finely grated lemon peel            2    Egg yolks
      1 pn Salt                                1 ts Vanilla extract

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      8 tb Unsalted butter                     2    Lemons; juiced
           - at room temperature             1/4 c  Heavy cream
    1/3 c  Honey                             1/2 c  Superfine sugar
      5    Egg yolks                         1/2 c  -Water
  1 1/2 c  Ground blanched almonds             1    Lemon; juiced

--------------------------------FOR SERVING--------------------------------
           Confectioners' sugar; sifted   
 
  To make the pastry, sift the flour and confectioners' sugar into a large
  cold bowl, stir in the grated lemon zest and salt, and add the butter.
  Quickly and lightly rub the mixture together with your fingers until it
  resembles coarse meal.  Beat the egg yolks and vanilla together and stir
  into the flour mixture.  Pull the dough together into a ball with your
  fingers, adding cold water only if necessary to make a soft dough. Tightly
  cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  
  Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 375 F.
  
  Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the pastry to fit a 9- to 10-inch
  tart pan with a removable bottom.  To transfer the pastry, wrap it around
  the rolling pin, lift above the pan, and unroll over the rim.  With your
  thumb and knuckle, gently press the pastry into the pan, then roll the
  rolling pin over the rim to trim the edges.  Line with aluminum foil and
  bake 6 to 8 minutes or until just set.  Set aside, and lower the oven
  temperature to 325 F.
  
  To make the filling, beat the butter and honey with an electric mixer or by
  hand until pale and creamy.  Beat in the egg yolks one at a time.  Then
  stir in the almonds, the juice of 2 lemons (reserve the zest, removed in
  thin strips), and the cream.  Pour into the pastry shell and lightly smooth
  the top with a spatula.  Bake 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown and
  set.
  
  Meanwhile, combine the superfine sugar, reserved lemon zest, and water in a
  sugar pan or small heavy saucepan.  Slowly bring to a boil, then simmer 6
  minutes or until the syrup lightly coats the back of a metal spoon.  Set
  aside to cool slightly.
  
  Add the remaining lemon juice to the barely warm syrup and strain,
  reserving the zest.  Pour the syrup over the warm pie, remove from the pan,
  and liberally sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and the reserved zest.
  Serve immediately.
  
  Note: To make the pastry in the food processor, chill the processor bowl
  and metal blade in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  Working very quickly,
  process the flour, sugar, lemon zest, and butter until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal.  Add the egg yolks and vanilla and pulse just to
  mix.  (It is unlikely that you will need to add water.)  Wrap and
  refrigerate.

      Title: Kotopita (Greek Chicken Pie)
 Categories: Greek, Poultry
      Yield: 10 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      3    Eggs; lightly beaten
      1    Chicken, stewed                   3/4 c  Grated cheese *(see note)
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine                      Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour                   1 ts Grated nutmeg
  2 1/2 c  Chicken broth/stock; warmed              Thyme or mint leaves;chopped
    1/4 c  Milk, optional                     12    Commercial filo sheets
 
  *Note: Suggested cheeses are either Mizithra or Kefalotyri.  If
  unavailable, Parmesan or Romano could be substituted.  :-(
  
  Remove the bones and skin from chicken and discard.  With your fingers tear
  the chicken into strips, not too small.  Set aside while you prepare the
  sauce.  Melt the 4 T butter in a heavy pan, then blend in the flour,
  without scorching, over medium heat.  Remove from the heat for a minute and
  stir in the warm broth, then return to the heat and cook gently until the
  sauce boils.  Cool.  Mix in the milk if the sauce seems too thick, then add
  the eggs, cheese, a little salt, pepper, nutmeg, and thyme.
  
  Butter a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and in it spread 6 filo sheets,
  brushing each with melted butter.  Pour in the chicken filling, then cover
  with the remaining filo sheets.  Tuck the top filo over the bottom and
  flute the edges.  Score the top 3 filo sheets with a sharp knife.  Bake in
  a moderate oven (350 F) for 40 minutes, or until crisp and golden chestnut
  in color.  Remove from oven and let stand for 15 minutes before cutting
  into 9 to 12 squares.  Serve warm.  (Serves 9 to 12)
  
  Note: In Epirus, Kotopita is sometimes made with a large amount of onions.
  If you would like to try it, use the recipe above plus 1 pound of Spanish-
  type onions.  Peel and slice the onions, boil in water for 5 minutes, and
  drain.  Prepare the sauce without the cheese and bake the chicken and
  onions in the sauce, between homemade filo, preferably, or commercial filo.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                           - (more if necessary)
      1    Frying or roasting chicken*         2 c  Chopped, drained tomatoes
      3 tb Vegetable oil or butter             2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      1    Onion; chopped                      1 pn Dried marjoram or thyme
      2 tb Butter                                   Salt & freshly ground pepper
      2 tb All-purpose flour (optional)             Water if necessary
      1 c  Dry white wine                 
 
  *Note: Chicken should be about 3 pounds, and cut into serving pieces.
  
  Wash and dry the chicken.  In a frying pan, heat the oil or butter and sear
  the chicken over high heat, turning constantly to avoid burning the
  chicken.  Remove each piece when reddish in color.  Lower the heat and
  saute the onion until soft, adding butter while stirring.  For a thicker
  sauce, add the flour and cook 2 minutes, then add the wine and tomatoes.
  Simmer until thickened, then strain the sauce into a baking-serving
  casserole.  Sprinkle the herbs over the chicken, season lightly with salt
  and pepper, and shake the casserole gently.  Chicken should be almost
  covered with liquid; if not, add a little water.  Cover tightly and simmer
  over low heat or transfer to a medium oven (350 F) to bake for 1 hour, or
  until the chicken is tender and the sauce thick.  Serve warm.

      Title: Kouloura Rolls and Buns
 Categories: Greek, Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      5 tb Sugar; if making Koulourakia
      2 tb Dry or cake yeast                   3 tb Butter, margarine or oil
    1/2 c  Warm water                        3/4 ts Salt
      2 c  Milk; warm                          7 c  All-purpose flour; unsifted
      3 tb Sugar; -OR-                         1    Egg

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      1    Egg yolk                          1/4 c  Sesame seeds
 
  Melt yeast in warm water.  Set aside.  Bring milk to boil.  Add sugar,
  butter and salt.  Allow milk to cool slightly.
  
  Put flour in a large bowl leaving about a tablespoon of it in the measuring
  cup for hands and make a hole in the center.  Pour liquid into it. Add
  yeast and egg.  Start mixing with spoon or paddle, pushing flour from all
  sides into center.  Dough will be sticky until flour is absorbed. Begin
  kneading dough in the bowl and then transfer it to a lightly floured board.
  Continue kneading until dough is smooth and elastic, about 20 minutes.
  
  Place dough in a greased bowl.  Cover with towel dampened with hot water.
  Set aside in a warm place to rise until bulk has doubled, about 4 hours.
  
  Punch down in the middle.  Knead for a few minutes and shape into a round
  loaf or into individual rolls (see below).  Using fingers, rub top with egg
  yolk and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Place in greased baking pans. Let
  rise once more, uncovered, in a warm place, approximately 1 hour.
  
  Bake in preheated oven at 375 F for 45 minutes.  Remove from oven; allow to
  cool 10 minutes before removing bread from pan.
  
  To Shape Traditional KOULOURA:  Divide dough into 3 long ropes.  Braid
  together.  Place braid in a greased tube pan or a large round baking pan.
  Stretch dough to make ends meet.  Use egg yolk to stick ends together.
  
  To Shape KOULOURAKIA Rolls:  Pinch off pieces of dough.  Roll on board with
  the palms of your hands to make a rope 6" long.  Twist it into a hairpin,
  coil the ends around each other and stick the tips together with a dab of
  egg yolk.  Or coil it like a snake, round and round; or roll into small
  round balls using the palms of your hands.  Do not flatten or press down as
  you roll.

      Title: Koulourakia (Sesame Cookies)
 Categories: Greek, Cookies
      Yield: 70 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      3 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Butter                            1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 c  Caster sugar                      1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 ts Vanilla essence                   1/4 c  Milk
      3    Eggs                              1/2 c  Toasted sesame seeds
      5 c  Plain flour                    
 
  Makes: 70 Cooking time: 15-20 minutes Oven temperature: 190 C (375 F)
  
  Cream butter and sugar with vanilla essence until light and fluffy.  Beat
  eggs, reserve 1 tablespoon for glazing and add remainder gradually to
  butter mixture, beating well.
  
  Sift dry ingredients twice.  Stir into creamed mixture alternately with
  milk to form a soft dough.  Knead lightly until smooth.  If dough is
  sticky, chill for 1 hour.
  
  Scatter some sesame seeds lightly on one side of pastry board.  Shape
  pieces of dough into thick pencil shapes and roll onto the sesame seeds to
  coat lightly or according to taste.  Double over rolled dough and twist, or
  form into rings, figure eights or coils.  Place on greased baking sheets
  and glaze with reserved egg beaten with a little milk.  Bake in a moderate
  oven for 15-20 minutes until golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack and store
  in an airtight container.
  
  Variation:  Roll dough in granulated sugar instead of seeds.  Glaze lightly
  with milk.

      Title: Kourambiedes
 Categories: Cookies, Greek
      Yield: 50 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Sweet butter                        1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar                  2 1/4 c  Sifted cake flour; (or more)
      1    Egg yolk                          3/4 c  Ground almonds; toasted
      2 tb Brandy or Cognac, (optional)        1 lb Powdered sugar; sifted
      1 ts Almond extract                 
 
  In electric mixing bowl, whip the sweet butter until it is fluffy and
  white.  Continuing to beat on medium speed, gradually add the 1/2 cup
  powdered sugar, egg yolk, and flavorings.
      Meanwhile, sift the baking powder with the flour and gradually add to
  the batter, mixing by hand and working the flour thoroughly into the
  mixture before adding more.  Mix in ground almonds.  Knead until a soft,
  buttery dough is formed that will stay together when a little is rolled in
  the palms of your hands.  Break off pieces slightly larger than a walnut,
  then roll into balls, half-moons, or S-curves.  Place on cookie sheets
  allowing an inch between each.  Bake on the center rack of a 350-degree
  oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden colored, not chestnut.  Remove
  from the oven and carefully lift each Kourambie and place on a generous
  layer of sifted powdered sugar.  Immediately sift more powdered sugar over
  to cover Kourambiedes.  Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before lifting
  and rolling to be sure they are evenly coated.  May be served in individual
  fluted paper cups.

      Yield: 60 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
      3 tb Butter or margarine                      Salt & freshly ground pepper
      2    Shallots or onions; minced        1/2 c  Grated cheese*
      1 lb Lean ground lamb or beef            1    Egg; lightly beaten
    1/2 c  Dry white wine                      1 tb Bread crumbs; if necessary
      3    Sprigs fresh parsley;chopped        1 lb Commercial filo sheets
      1 tb Chopped fresh mint or dill          1 c  Butter; melted
 
  *Note: Suggested cheeses for this recipe are Greek kefalotyri or Parmesan.
  
  Heat the 3 tablespoons butter or margarine and cook the shallots until
  soft, then add the meat and mash with a fork over medium heat until the
  color changes.  Add the wine and simmer a few minutes.  Stir in the herbs
  and tomato sauce; season with salt and pepper to taste and simmer for 20
  minutes.  Cool.  Add the cheese and egg, and if the mixture is very liquid,
  stir in the bread crumbs immediately before stuffing.
  
  Filo sheets should be unrolled flat, and cut into thirds (3 x 11 inches).
  Pile up the filo, covering it with waxed paper and a damp towel.  Take out
  one sheet at a time and keep the rest covered.  Butter the filo, one sheet
  at a time, using a pastry brush and the 1 cup melted butter.  Place 1
  teaspoon of the meat filling 1 inch from the end nearest you.  Fold the
  filo back over the filling so the bottom edge meets the left edge, forming
  a right angle. Continue folding back at right angles to make the triangular
  shape.  Place on baking sheets and keep covered until all are ready to
  bake.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes or until
  golden and crisp, turning once.  Serve hot.

      Yield: 24 servings
 
      2 c  Flour                               1 tb Water

  Kreplach
  
  Prepare one recipe noodle dough (see below).  Roll out but don't let dry.
  Cut into 3-inch squares and place a tablespoon of one of the following
  mixtures on each. Fold over the dough into a triangle. Press edges together
  with a little water. Cook in boiling salted water or soup 20 minutes, or
  until they rise to the top. They can then be fried or served immediately in
  the soup. Makes 24 or more, according to how thin you roll the dough.
  
  HOMEMADE NOODLE DOUGH
  
  Place unsifted flour on a board and make a well in the center.  Drop eggs,
  water and salt into it.  Work the four with one hand and knead until smooth
  and elastic.  Roll and stretch the dough as thin as possible. The thinner
  it is, the better the noodles. ***STOP HERE FOR KREPLACH RECIPE*** Let the
  rolled dough stand until it feels dry to the tough, but don't let it get
  too dry.  you can cut the dough into squares, strips or very narrow
  noodles.  For narrow ones roll up like jelly roll and slice as thin as
  possible.  Shake until they separate, and let dry very thoroughly.  Cook
  the amount you want in boiling salted water or soup for about 10 minutes.
  Keep the balance in tightly closed jars.

      Title: Kythoni Peltes (Quince Jelly)
 Categories: Greek, Condiment
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                           Granulated sugar
      1 kg Quinces                             2 ts Lemon juice
      4 c  Water                               2    Rose geranium leaves
 
  Cooking time: 2 hours
  
  Wash quinces well to remove the fuzz.  Peel and core.  Slice quinces into
  preserving pan and add 2 cups water.  Leave aside and do not be concerned
  if quince discolours.
  
  Place peels and cores into a pan with remaining water and boil for 30
  minutes.  Strain and make liquid up to 2 cups with water.  Add liquid from
  peels to sliced quinces in pan.  Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 1
  hour until quince flesh is very tender.
  
  Scald a large piece of cheese cloth or doubled butter muslin, wring out and
  drape over a deep bowl.  Pour quince and liquid into clean cloth and gather
  up ends.  Tie with string and suspend over bowl.  Secure to a fixed object
  so that juice can drip slowly into bowl.  Leave for 24 hours.  Do not
  squeeze bag to hasten dripping as this will make jelly cloudy. Measure
  juice into clean preserving pan.  For each cup of juice add 1 cup sugar.
  Stir over heat till sugar dissolves, add lemon juice and washed geranium
  leaves and bring to the boil.
  
  Boil rapidly for 25 minutes, skimming frequently.  Test a teaspoonful on a
  cold saucer.  Leave to cool.  Run finger across jelly in saucer - setting
  point is reached when surface wrinkles.  It is advisable to remove pan from
  heat while jelly is being tested as you would overcook the jelly. Remove
  leaves and ladle hot jelly into hot sterilized jars.  Seal when cold.

  *Note: almonds should be toasted.
  
  Cooking time: 1 1/2 hours
  
  Wash quinces well and rub off all fuzz.  Peel, quarter and remove core.
  Place peels and cores in a pan with 2 cups water and boil for 20 minutes.
  Grate quince quarters and place in a heavy preserving pan with remaining
  water.  Leave aside until peels are boiled.  Do not be concerned if quince
  discolours.
  
  Strain liquid from peels into a measuring jug and make up to 2 cups with
  water.  Add this to grated quince with the sugar, lemon rind and cinnamon
  bark or washed geranium leaves.  Place over medium heat and stir
  occasionally with a wooden spoon until sugar is dissolved.  Bring to the
  boil and boil fairly rapidly for 1 hour or until it gels when tested on a
  cold saucer.
  
  Stir in almonds and lemon juice and boil 1 minute longer.  Ladle into hot,
  sterilized jars and seal when cold.
  
  Note:  As the peel and core contain pectin, the setting ingredients for
  jellies and preserves, it is advisable that these be boiled to extract the
  pectin.

  cup of pulp.  Set over medium heat and stir occasionally until sugar is
  dissolved.
  
  Bring to the boil, then boil steadily for 40-45 minutes, stirring
  occasionally so that paste cooks evenly.  As paste is thick, it has a
  tendency to scorch, so watch carefully.
  
  When cooked, paste comes away from sides of pan and is dark red in colour.
  Spread while hot into an oiled slab cake pan so that it is 2 cm (3/4 inch)
  thick.  Leave in pan at room temperature for 2-3 days, lightly covered with
  muslin.
  
  When dry and firm, cut into small diamond shapes with an oiled knife. Lift
  out and place in a container with bay leaves between layers.  Seal tightly.
  
  When serving, dip tops lightly into caster sugar to give pieces a fine
  coating.  Kythonopasto keeps indefinitely stored at room temperature and is
  traditionally served in place of a spoon sweet, accompanied with a glass of
  iced water.

    1/2 lb Puff pastry                              - and tossed with
           -(fresh or thawed frozen)                Lemon juice
      1 c  Sugar                             1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 c  Water                             1/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted
      5 lb Golden Delicious apples                  Sugar
           - peeled, cored, quartered     
 
  FOR PASTRY: Preheat oven to 300 F.  Roll pastry 1/8 inch thick.  Cut into
  circle 1 inch larger than diameter of 1-quart-souffle dish.  Transfer to
  baking sheet, prick with fork and bake 30 minutes.  If not quite browned,
  increase heat to 350 F.  Combine 1/2 cup sugar with water in 8-inch skillet
  and cook, swirling pan frequently, until carmelized.  Pour into 1-quart
  souffle dish.  Begin adding apples, arranging vertically (fill dish as

  evenly over top.  Cover with foil, making several slits to allow steam to
  escape.  Lay piece of foil on lower oven rack to catch any juices that
  might overflow.  Bake, basting frequently, until apples are tender, about
  1-1/2 hours.  Remove from oven and cool 15 minute.  Carefully pour off
  juices into 8-inch skillet and boil over medium-high heat until reduced and
  carmelized.
  
  Run knife around inside of souffle dish to loosen apples.  Set pastry over
  fruit.  Place serving plate on top and invert.  Pour carmelized juices over
  top.  Heat heavy skillet until quite hot.  Dust tarte with sugar and hold
  bottom of hot skillet over top of tarte to sear sugar, or place under

      Title: Lacy Potato Pancakes (Latkes)
 Categories: Pancakes, Jewish, Breakfast
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4    Potatoes - peeled                   1 ts Baking powder
      1 sm Onion                               1 ts Salt
      2    Eggs                                1 pn Lemon pepper
    1/3 c  Flour                          
 
  or pepper oil - for frying
  
  Grate potatoes either using the largest holes on a four-sided hand grater,
  or the grater attachment on a food processor.  Place potatoes in a colander
  and rinse under cold water to remove the starch.  Be sure to allow potatoes
  to drain well.  Grate onion, removing any excess moisture by placing in
  colander and pressing with the back of a wooden spoon. Combine potato and
  onion.  Beat eggs into mixture; stir in flour, baking powder, salt and
  pepper.  If using a food processor, combine ingredients using plastic knife
  attachment so potatoes remain in grated pieces. Heat 1/8" of oil in a large
  skillet.  For each pancake, drop about 2 tablespoons of batter into the oil
  and flatten with the back of a wooden spoon; the flatter the pancake, the
  crisper it will be. Brown well on both sides. Drain well on paper towels.
  Keep the cooked pancakes warm in a 100 F oven. Serve with Pink Cinnamon
  Applesauce (see recipe) and/or sour cream. Makes about 2 dozen regular size
  or 5 dozen miniatures.  Pancakes may be made ahead of time and refrigerated
  between layers of waxed paper when cooled. To reheat, place in a single
  layer on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake uncovered at 450 F for 5 minutes,
  or until crisp and hot.

           -- cleaned and skinned            1/2 c  Vinegar
      2    Celery stalks, with leaves,       1/4 c  Butter or margarine
           -- chopped                               Salt
      2 md Onions; chopped                          Freshly ground pepper

      2    Sprigs fresh rosemary          
 
  After washing the rabbit or hare thoroughly and cutting into serving
  pieces, place in a large glass or earthenware bowl.  Make a marinade by
  combining the celery, onions, carrots, herbs, peppercorns, wine, and
  vinegar and pouring over the meat.  Cover and refrigerate for a day or two,
  turning the pieces over occasionally.
  
  On serving day, drain, reserving the marinade, and wipe dry.  Transfer the
  marinade to a casserole and simmer for 15 minutes.  While the marinade is
  cooking, heat the butter in a large frying pan, and when very hot sear the
  meat over high heat until it is reddened in color without browning. Remove
  from the heat, and with a spatula lift the rabbit or hare pieces into the
  simmering marinade, then pour in the remaining butter.  Taste for
  seasoning, then add the salt and pepper, tomatoes, and allspice.  Weight
  the meat with a small plate to keep it under the sauce, then bake it in a
  very slow oven (225 F) for 2-1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the
  sauce thickened.

 Categories: Ethnic, Casseroles, Lamb
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4    Lamb chops*                         3 tb Whole black peppercorns
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour                        *Thin round-bone shoulder
      1 lb White cabbage; cored, and                -lamb chops, trimmed but

    1/2 c  Hot water                      
 
  Directions: Directions: Lightly salt the chops, preferably an hour before
  you plan to cook them. Oil a heavy casserole that can be placed on top of
  the stove and that is just wide enough to hold two chops.
  
  Put in two chops and sprinkle them with flour.  Place a 1/2 to 1-inch layer
  of cabbage over them, sprinkle with salt and then flour, and dot with
  butter. Continue making layers, ending with cabbage and a little butter.
  Pour on the hot water.
  
  Tie the peppercorns securely in cheesecloth and lightly bruise them with a
  rolling pin, or bruise them with pestle and mortar and put them in a metal
  spice-holding ball.  Bury the peppercorns in the casserole.
  
  Cover and bring to the boil.  Immediately lower the heat and simmer very
  gently for about 1 1/2 hours, until the meat is very tender and the cabbage
  almost melted.  Remove the peppercorns.  Serve with boiled potatoes.

      Title: Lamb & Pear Tagine
 Categories: Lamb, Moroccan
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lg Onions, peeled & sliced             1 ts Cumin
      1 kg Lean lamb, leg or shoulder          1 ts Ground coriander
           -cut into 4cm cubes.                1 ts Ground ginger
      4    Pears, peeled cored & cut           1 ts Cinnamon
           -into 4cm chunks                    1 ts Black pepper
    1/2 c  Sultanas                                 Water, to cover the meat
    1/2 c  Silvered almonds                         Salt, to tast
      1 tb Olive oil                      
 
  Intro. Tagines are Moroccan slow-cooked meat, fruit & vegitable dishes
  which are almost invariablely made with mutton. Using lamb cuts down the
  cooking time, but if you can find good hogget (older than lamb, younger
  than mutton, commonly labelled "baking legs" and sold cheaply) that will do
  very well.
  
  1. In a large saucepan gently fry the onion in the olive oil until soft,
  add the meat to the pan and cook until it changes color, then add the
  spices. Add water to just cover the meat and salt to taste. Cover and
  simmer gently until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 - 2 hours. (Displace
  the lid a little after an hour if there appears to be too much liquid.)
  
  2. Add the pears to the meat together with the sultanas & almonds. Cook for
  a further 5 minutes or until the pears are soft. Serve with rice.

  place in the oven for 1 1/4 hours, or until meat is tender. Meanwhile,
  combine sausage and zucchini in an ovenproof dish, cover and place in the
  oven until sausages are cooked, about 20 minutes. Follow directions on the
  back of the box and cook the couscous. Remove stewed lamb and the sausage/
  vegetable mixture from the oven. Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat
  from the sauce and place it in a serving bowl. Pour off and discard any
  excess fat from the sausages and add sausages and vegetables to the lamb.
  Pour the thin gravy through a fine strainer into the serving bowl and
  discard the vegetables and spices that remain in the strainer. To serve,
  place the couscous in another serving dish. Pour the broth into a pitcher
  or soup tureen. Encourage guests to place couscous in their soup bowl, top
  with the meat and vegetables and moisten with soup.

      6 c  Veal, lamb or chicken stock       3/4 c  Uncooked elbow macaroni

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese                   Freshly ground pepper
           -=OR=- Romano cheese                     Virgin olive oil
      1 sm Onion; finely minced           
 
  IN A DUTCH OVEN or 3-quart heavy pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over
  high heat on top of the stove. Add the lamb in batches and brown well on
  all sides. Do not crowd the pot or the meat will steam rather than brown.
  Remove and reserve as pieces become brown. Discard fat. Preheat oven to
  350F. When all the meat has browned, lower heat to low, add 2 tablespoons
  oil and add the celery, carrot and garlic. Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Return
  the meat to the pot. Add the stock and beans. Bring to a boil, add the
  marjoram or oregano, cover, and bake 1 1/2 hours, or until the lamb is
  cooked and the beans are tender. Meanwhile, using a small paring knife, cut
  off tip and stem of the tomatoes. Remove the seeds and core, leaving only
  firm, outer pulp. Slice one side of each tomato and lay it flat on work
  surface. Cut into 1/4-inch lengthwise strips, pile up strips and cut across
  into 1/4-inch pieces. Reserve on a plate until needed. Add the macaroni to
  the casserole, replace in oven, and cook, covered, another 20 minutes, or
  until pasta is tender. Remove the fresh herb sprigs and add the tomatoes.
  Transfer to a large tureen or divide among individual soup bowls. Offer
  grated cheese, minced onions, ground pepper and olive oil as garnishes at
  the table.

  1 1/2 lb Lean lamb, finely ground                 - Small curd cottage cheese,
      2 lg Ripe tomatoes; peeled, diced             - drained
      1 ts Honey                             1/3 c  Finely grated feta cheese
      1 tb Ground cinnamon; OR to taste      1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
    1/2 ts Sea salt; OR to taste               2    Egg yolks
      1 ts Cracked black pepper               12    Phyllo sheets
           -OR to taste                  

--------------------------------FOR SERVING--------------------------------
           Confectioners' sugar                     Ground cinnamon
 
  Warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a
  heavy skillet and saute the onion over low heat until soft, about 8
  minutes.  Raise the heat, add the meat, and saute until lightly browned,
  breaking up any lumps with a wooden spoon.  Add the tomatoes, honey,
  cinnamon, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper, and bring to a boil.  Add
  the stock, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer 15 minutes, or
  until almost all the liquid has evaporated.  Add the marjoram and parsley,
  and additional cinnamon, marjoram, and pepper to taste (do not add salt at
  this point, as the cheese mixture is salty).  Set aside, or refrigerate for
  up to 24 hours.
  
  Heat the oven to 375 F.  Press the myzithra through a sieve or food mill
  into a bowl.  Combine with the feta, nutmeg, remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper,
  and the egg yolks, cover and set aside.
  
  Combine the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and olive oil in a small
  saucepan, and melt over very low heat.  Brush a heavy baking sheet with
  some of this mixture.  Lay the phyllo sheets one on top of another and cut
  in half crosswise to make 24 sheets.  Tightly rewrap half the sheets and
  refrigerate.  Lay 1 of the remaining sheets on a clean work surface, with a
  long end facing you, and brush lightly with the butter mixture.  Lay a
  second sheet on top, brush it with the mixture, and repeat with a third
  sheet.  Lay another sheet on top.  Divide the meat mixture into 6 portions.
  Place 1 portion on the bottom third of the top phyllo sheet and shape it
  into a sausage about 8 inches long.  Divide the cheese filling into 6
  portions and spread 1 portion over the meat.  Fold the bottom edges of the
  phyllo layers over the filling, then fold over the 2 sides, and roll up to
  make a firm neat parcel.  Place on the baking sheet and repeat with the
  remaining phyllo and filling.
  
  Brush the rolls with the remaining butter mixture and bake 25 to 30
  minutes, or until deep golden brown.  Drain on paper towels, sprinkle
  liberally with the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon, and transfer to a
  warm platter.

           Karen Mintzias                    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      2 tb Butter or margarine                 5 sl Toast (thin)
      1 md Onion; chopped                  1 1/2 c  Milk
  1 1/2 lb Lean lamb (pref.leg), ground        3    Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 ts Ground cinnamon (or more)         3/4 c  Grated mizithra & kefalotyri
           Salt & freshly ground pepper       12    Commercial filo sheets
      1 c  Tomato sauce or puree               6 tb Butter; melted
           - diluted w/ water & warmed    
 
  In a frying pan, heat the 2 tablespoons butter and cook the onion until
  translucent. Add the lamb and cook gently, while mashing and stirring with
  a fork until the raw color disappears. Season the meat with cinnamon, salt,
  pepper, then stir in the tomato sauce and parsley. Cover the pan and simmer
  for 20 minutes. (This much can be cooked a day in advance and stored in the
  refrigerator.) Meanwhile, soak the toast slices in the milk to make a soft
  mixture, and add to the meat along with the eggs and cheese. Mix the
  filling with a wooden spoon, taste, and add more cinnamon if you like.
  
  Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 x 12 x 3 inch baking pan. Spread 6 filo
  sheets, brushing melted butter in between the sheets, making sure the pasry
  fits the sides and bottom of the pan. Pour in the filling, spreading evenly
  with a spatula. Cover with the remaining 6 filo sheets, brushing with
  butter as before. Flute the edges with two fingers or a fork and brush the
  top with butter. Using a sharp knife, score the top 3 filo sheets into
  square or diamond shapes. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes in a moderately slow
  oven (325 F), raising the temperature to 350 F during the last 10 minutes.
  Remove from the oven and let stand on a rack for 15 minutes. Cut into
  diamonds or squares and serve warm.

  lamb, onion, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and saffron. Cook, tightly covered,
  over medium heat for 30 minutes.
  Meanwhile, in a bowl combine vinegar and 1 quart water. Trim off stems,
  tough outer leaves, and sharp tips of artichokes, leaving pale, tender
  interior leaves. Cut in half lengthwise; scoop out and discard hairy
  chokes. As artichokes are trimmed, immerse in vinegar-water.
  After meat cooks 30 minutes, turn heat high, uncover pan, and stir often
  until juices evaporate and meat browns, 15-20 minutes. Stir in 2 cups
  water; simmer, covered, for 1 hour.
  Drain artichokes and add to lamb; simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. Add 8
  preserved lemon quarters and olives; simmer, covered, until artichokes are
  tender when pierced, about 10 minutes longer. Add 2 tablespoons liquid from
  preserved lemons or lemon juice. Skim and discard fat from stew. Pour stew
  into a bowl and garnish with remaining lemon quarters.

 Categories: Greek, Meats, Lamb
      Yield: 20 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      2    Lemons
      1    Baby lamb or kid, 10-12 kg        1/4 c  Butter; melted
           Salt                              1/4 c  Olive oil
           Freshly ground black pepper   

--------------------------SPINACH & FETA STUFFING--------------------------
  2 1/2 kg Spinach                           1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
      3 c  Chopped spring onions             1/4 c  Chopped fresh mint
    3/4 c  Olive oil                                Salt
      1 c  Short grain rice                         Freshly ground black pepper
  1 1/2 kg Feta cheese                    
 
  Serves: 20 Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 4-5 hours
  
  Wipe lamb inside and out with a damp cloth.  Rub cavity and outside of lamb
  with lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Cover and leave aside until stuffing is
  prepared.
  
  Trim roots from spinach and remove discoloured and damaged leaves.  Wash
  spinach in several changes of water, drain well and chop coarsely.
  
  In a large deep pan (not aluminium) gently fry spring onions in oil until
  soft, add spinach and stir over heat until it wilts.  Stir in washed rice,
  cover pan and cook on low heat for 10 minutes until most of liquid is
  absorbed.  Remove from heat and cool.  Break up feta into small chunks and
  add to spinach mixture with herbs.  Mix well, taste, then add salt if
  necessary and a generous grinding of pepper.  Blend thoroughly.
  
  Partly sew up the cavity with white string, pack stuffing in through
  opening and finish sewing up the cavity.  Push foreshanks back towards body
  and tie in postition, passing string over back of carcase.  Tie back legs,
  leaving them a little apart - tying will prevent them splaying outwards.
  Rub outside again with lemon juice, salt and pepper and place on a rack set
  in a large catering-size baking dish.
  
  Combine melted butter with olive oil and brush half of this over the lamb
  or kid.  Cover dish with large sheets of foil, sealing joins with double
  folds.  Press foil under edges of dish to seal completely.
  
  Bake in a moderate oven for 4-5 hours.  After 2 hours lift foil and brush
  meat with butter-oil mixture.  Cook for further 1 1/2 to 2 hours, remove
  foil, brush again and cook uncovered for 30 minutes or until meat is cooked
  through and browned.  Remove from oven, cover with foil and a thick cloth
  and leave to rest for 30 minutes before carving.  Lift lamb or kid onto a
  large wooden board, remove string and spoon stuffing onto a platter. Turn
  the carcase onto its back and chop along backbone from the inside with a
  cleaver.  Then chop each half into chunks and pile onto platters. Meat on
  legs may be carved into slices.

      Title: Lemon and Thyme Marinade
 Categories: Poultry, French, Marinade
      Yield: 14 servings
 
      2 tb Strained fresh lemon juice               -tsp dried, crumbled
      2 ts Chopped fresh thyme, OR 3/4         2 tb Olive oil OR vegetable oil
 
  This is a tangy marinade, containing equal amounts of lemon juice and oil,
  and is good for rich meats like chicken thighs. It can be used for chicken
  breasts too, but their skin should be on for additional protection during
  grilling or broiling.  Thyme gives this marinade a flavor loved in France,
  but you can substitute oregano for an Italian or Greek accent, or mint or
  cilantro for a Lebanese touch.
  
  Mix ingredients in a small bowl.

      Title: Lemon Gelato
 Categories: Italian, Desserts
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      6 md Lemons                            1/8 ts Salt
  1 1/3 c  Sugar                           2 2/3 c  Half-and-half
      6    Egg yolks                       1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/3 c  Heavy cream                    
 
  PREPARATION:  Grate the zest of 6 lemons and set aside in a bowl with the
  sugar.  OR, use a vegetable peeler to remove 3/4 cup zest from the lemons
  and process the lemon strips with the sugar in a food processor until zest
  is minced, about 30 seconds.  Set lemons aside.
  
  COOKING:  Whisk the egg yolks with the cream and salt in a heatproof mixing
  bowl.  Put the half-and-half and lemon-sugar in a medium non- aluminum
  saucepan.  Bring liquid to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove
  pan from heat.  Slowly whisk the hot half-and-half into the egg yolk
  mixture.  Then return the partially cooked custard to the saucepan. Stir
  constantly over medium-low heat until mixture begins to thicken slightly
  and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes (the approximate consistency
  of unwhipped heavy cream).  Pour hot custard into a bowl without straining.
  Stir in the vanilla.  Put a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface
  of the custard to prevent skin from forming. Set custard aside at room
  temperature to cool.  (Can cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up
  to 48 hours.)
  
  FREEZING:  Squeeze 3/4 cup juice from the lemons and stir juice into cooled
  custard.  Transfer the custard mixture to an ice cream maker and freeze
  according to manufacrurer's instructions.
  
  Makes about 1 1/2 quarts.

      Title: Lentils with Italian Sausage
 Categories: Italian, Pork/ham, Vegetables, Sausages
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 lb Dry lentils                         1    Rib celery, finely chopped
           Cold water                          1    Carrot, finely chopped
      2 lb Fresh italian sausage, sweet        2    Cloves garlic, finely minced
           Or hot                              8    Fresh sage leaves, chopped,
           About 3 cups homemade or                 Or 1 tsp. dried, rubbed sage
           Canned chicken broth                     Salt and pepper to taste
    1/4 c  Olive oil                           3 tb Tomato paste, diluted in a
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped                    Little water
 
  Clean lentils well by soaking them briefly and changing the water at least
  once.  Put them in a 2-1/2-quart saucepan, add cold water to cover, and
  bring to a boil.  Lower heat to simmer and cook until not quite done, about
  45 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, pierce sausages in several places, and then put them in a small
  saucepan.  Add enough chicken broth to cover, and place over medium heat.
  Bring to a gentle boil, and simmer for about 40 minutes.  From time to
  time, skim off and discard foam and fat that rise to the top.  When
  sausages are done, remove the pot from the heat and let them sit in the
  broth while you finish the lentils.
  
  Warm the oil in a medium skillet, and saute' the onion, celery, carrot,
  garlic and sage in the olive oil over medium heat until the onion is
  translucent and the vegetables are done.  Drain the lentils, saving their
  liquid.  To the lentil pot, add the vegetables, season with salt and
  pepper, and add tomato paste.  Mix gently using a wooden spoon.  Add 3/4
  cup of the broth in which you cooked the sausages.  Taste and adjust the
  seasoning, if needed.
  
  To serve, slice the sausages and arrange them on a platter next to the warm
  lentils.

      Title: Linguine with Tarragon and Clam Sauce
 Categories: Italian, Pasta, Fish/sea, Sauces
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Recipe Egg Pasta (OR 3/4 Lb              -clams (about 2 Lbs)
           -dry linguine)                    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      2    Cloves garlic                     1/4 c  Olive oil
      2 tb Fresh tarragon, chopped (2        1/8 ts Red-pepper flakes
           -tsp dried)                              Salt
     30    Steamers or other small                  Pepper
 
  PREPARATION:  Make the Egg Pasta.  Roll as thin as possible and cut into
  1/8-inch wide strips for linguine.  Mince the garlic.  Chop the tarragon.
  Scrub the clams, discarding any that have opened.  Place clams and wine in
  a large pot; cook, covered, over medium-high heat, shaking occasionally,
  until all the clams have opened, about 6 minutes.  Remove pot from heat and
  allow clams to cool.  Remove clams from shells; if using steamers, pull off
  the black portion of the neck.  Swish clams in the cooking liquid to remove
  any loose sand.  Strain cooking liquid through cheesecloth or a coffee
  filter.  Chop clams and put them in a bowl with the strained cooking
  liquid.  Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Heat the remaining 3
  tablespoons of the olive oil over low heat in a small saucepan. Add the
  garlic and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the tarragon and
  red-pepper flakes and cook for 2 minutes more.  Add the clams and cooking
  liquid, bring to a simmer, and remove saucepan from the heat. Season with
  salt and pepper.  NOTE:  Recipe can be made to this point several hours
  ahead.
  
  COOKING AND SERVING:  Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water until tender,
  about 3 minutes for fresh pasta.  Meanwhile, reheat the clam sauce if made
  ahead.  Drain the pasta and return to the pot.  Toss linguine with the clam
  sauce and adjust the seasoning, if desired.  Serve immediately.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: Lobster, Normandy Style (Homard a la Normande)
 Categories: Fish/sea, French
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Fresh lobsters, live               12 c  Calvados
    1/2 c  Sweet butter                        3 c  Heavy cream
           Salt                                3 tb All purpose flour
           Freshly ground white pepper       1/2    Lemon, juice of
    1/2 c  Finely chopped shallots or          1 ds Cayenne pepper
           -scallions                          2 tb Finely chopped fresh parsley
 
  Servings: 4
  
  Split the lobsters lengthwise with a big knife and break the shells off the
  claws with a hammer or a cleaver. Pour the liquid and the tomalley (the
  liver) into a small bowl. Discard the stomach (the small sac which is
  behind the eyes).
  
  Melt half the butter in a large, heavy saucepan. When the butter turns the
  color of a hazelnut, add the lobsters and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
  Cook over high heat for eight to 10 minutes, turning lobsters often. They
  should turn evenly red all over. Remove the lobsters from the saucepan.
  Arrange in a large roasting pan and place in a preheated 250-F oven to keep
  them warm and to finish cooking.
  
  Add the shallots to the saucepan and sizzle exactly 1 minute without
  burning. Add the Calvados, ignite, and when the flame dies out, add the
  cream. Work together the remaining butter and the flour. When the sauce
  starts boiling, add the flour mixture (beurre manie), bit by bit, whipping
  vigorously into the sauce with a wire whisk until smooth. Bring slowly to a
  boil. Then mix in the tomalley and lemon juice. Taste for seasoning and add
  salt and cayenne pepper, if necessary. You may cook a bit longer to reduce
  the sauce if you like it thicker. Stir in the parsley. Pour the sauce over
  the lobsters and serve piping hot.
  
  A rice pilaf is usually served with this dish, and we would recommend a
  chilled white Traminer wine or a bottle of old cider.

  Few drops red food coloring (optional) Oil Powdered sugar
  
  Bring the water to a boil, add the sugar and stir until thoroughly
  dissolved. Mix the cornstarch with the juice and cream of tartar. Gradually
  pour into the boiling syrup, stirring constantly.  Continue cooking for 20
  min, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Add food coloring.  Oil a 7"
  square cake pan with sides 1 to 1 1/2" high. Pour in the mixture and let
  stand until cool and set. Cut into 1" squares.  Dust with powdered sugar
  and serve.
  
  HINT**  It takes a bit of trial and error to gauge when the lokum mixture
  is ready.  If it boils too long it will turn out hard like toffee, and if
  it is too soft it will not keep its shape when cool. It should feel soft
  but firm after cooling.

 Categories: Beef, French, Pork/ham
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 lb Lard                                1 ts Juniper berries
      2 lb Lean beef                                Salt and pepper
      2 lb Lean pork                         1/2    Bottle red wine (the
      3    Bay leaves                               -near-black wine of Cabors
           A few sprigs of thyme and                -or a
           -rosemary                      
 
  This is an unusual potted meat prepared only in the Languedoc.
  
  Serves 8 - 10
  
  Time:  Start at least 2 weeks ahead; 30 minutes plus 2 hours cooking,
  repeated 3 times
  
  First cooking: deep red Medoc)
  
  Second and third cooking: the same ingredients again each time
  
  You will need a large straight-sided earthenware pot.  Scald the
  earthenware pot and grease it thoroughly with a little of the lard (you can
  line the bottom with a few fig or walnut leaves if you have them).  Cut the
  beef and pork into slices, trimming the gristle and sinews as you do so.
  Put the bay leaves on the bottom of the pot. Lay in the meat slices,
  zseasoning with the herbs, salt, and freshly ground pepper as you do so.
  Pour in the wine - it should just cover the meat.
  
  Simmer the pot uncovered over a very low heat or in a preheated 250 F oven,
  for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the volume is reduced by half. Allow to cool.
  Seal with a layer of lard, melted and poured over the cool meat.  Cover
  with wax paper tied down with string.  Leave the pot on a refrigerator
  shelf for a week.  Then remove the lard seal and add in another 2 lbs pork
  and 2 lbs beef, the whole covered with wine, seasoned and cooked as before.
  Repeat the operation at the end of another week.  You will now have a
  delicious dark jelly- meat which you can either eat hot or cold.  If you

      Title: Loukanika
 Categories: Greek, Meats
      Yield: 20 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1 ts Crushed dried marjoram
      1 lb Lean pork shoulder, ground               -OR- thyme
    1/2 lb Fresh pork rind                     1    Bay leaf; ground in a mortar
           -- boiled for 2 hours,            1/3 c  Dry red wine
           -- drained, and ground              1 ts Ground allspice or coriander
    1/2 lb Pork fatback, ground                     -OR- both
      1 ts Salt                                     Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Navel orange                        2    Garlic cloves; crushed
           -- grated rind only                      Sausage casing
 
  Grind the pork, pork rind, and fatback through the fine blade of a meat
  chopper.  Combine in a large bowl with all the seasonings.  Knead
  thoroughly.  Store in the refrigerator while you prepare the casing.
  
  Ususally salted, the casing (pork intestine) especially the interior, must
  be rinsed under cold running water several times.  (To avoid losing casing
  down the drain while doing this, be sure the casing is inside a very large
  pan!)  Allow to drain on a linen towel.
  
  Use a pastry bag to force the stuffing into the casing.  Pinch at 3-1/2 to
  4 inch intervals allowing space between to form the sausage links. Normally
  the casing will not break, but if it does, that section must be discarded
  and a knot tied in the new "end".  To cook, poach in water for 1 hour, then
  drain, discarding the cooking water.  Fry the sausages in a frying pan over
  moderate heat, or use as suggested in any recipe.  Drain and serve hot.
  
  Note: To store, freeze uncooked in meal-sized batches.  The sausages should
  be used within a day or two if not frozen.

  FOR THE SAUCE
  
  Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
  
  To make the sauce, saute the onions, carrot, celery, and garlic in the

  hour, covered.  In the last 20 minutes of cooking, add the red wine.
  
  To make the bechamel sauce, bring the milk to a simmer in a small saucepan.
  Melt the butter in another saucepan and gradually whisk in the flour.  Cook
  for about 2 minutes, but do not let the mixture turn brown. Remove the
  saucepan from the heat and add the hot milk, whisking constantly.  Return
  the saucepan to low heat and cook, whisking constantly, for 5 to 10
  minutes, or until the sauce is medium thick.  Add the salt, pepper, and
  nutmeg.

  sauce.  Spoon on a third of the ricotta cheese, then a third of the
  bechamel sauce.  Cover with a layer of pasta, then tomato sauce, a third of
  the ricotta and a third of the bechamel.  Repeat one more time. Top with a
  layer of sliced mozzarella cheese.  Bake in a 375-degree oven for about 30
  minutes, or until piping hot.  Remove from the oven and sprinkle with
  optional Parmesan cheese before serving.

           Karen Mintzias                      3 tb Butter
    500 g  Macaroni or spaghetti               4 tb Grated cheese
      4 l  Water                                    -(Kefalotyri, Romano or

      1 tb Oil                            
 
  TO COOK PASTA:  Bring water to the boil with salt and oil.  Keep water

  and return to pan in which it was cooked.
  
  TO PREPARE FOR SERVING:  Melt butter and heat to a deep golden brown -- do
  not burn.  Pour over pasta, add grated cheese and toss well to coat
  strands.
  
  Serve extra grated cheese in a bowl.

  and toss gently to mix.
  
  Transfer to a large ovenproof platter, sprinkle top with more cheese and
  bake for 10 minutes at 350 F.  Serve hot.

      Title: Mageritsa (Easter Lamb Soup)
 Categories: Greek, Soups/stews, Lamb
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    2/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley
           Intestines, heart, lungs,         1/2 c  Chopped fresh dill
           & liver of 1 lamb.                1/4 c  Chopped celery leaves
           1 lamb's feet and tripe, opt        6 tb Raw long-grain white rice
      1    Lamb's head (optional)            1/2 ts Aniseed (optional)
           Salt                                     Freshly ground pepper
      2    Lemons (juice only)                 3    Whole eggs
      1 sm Bunch scallions; chopped       
 
  Note: If using the lamb's head, wash it, then soak it in cold water for 3
  hours. Drain. Cut the head in half, using a sharp knife, and tie with a
  clean string.
  
  If using the lamb's feet and tripe, prepare as follows: If tripe is not
  parially cooked, cut open with a sharp knife and clean the inside
  thoroughly under running water. Put in a pan with cold salted water to
  cover and soak for 30 minutes, then drain and wash with cold water. Cut
  into small pieces and put in a large soup pot with the lamb's feet. cover
  with cold water, and simmer until tender, adding salt to taste during the
  last minutes of cooking. Cube the tripe, remove the meat of the feet from
  the bones, and add to the mageritsa at the same time as the cut-up
  intestines, adjusting the liquid by adding more water.
  
  Clean the intestines thoroughly by turning them inside out, using a long
  skewer or stick (this turning will be quicker if the intestines are first
  cut into 2-foot lengths), then wash under cold running water until clean.
  Rub the intestines with salt and the juice of 1/2 lemon, rinse again in
  cold water and drain. Braid the intestines or tie the ends together with
  clean string. Put in a large soup pot with the lamb's head, if using, and
  cove with cold water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat, skim, and
  simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the intestines, drain them, and cut into 1/4
  inch pieces with the scissors and set aside to add to the soup later. (Use
  the remaining portion of the head for another dish.)
  
  Bring the soup stock to a boil and add the scallions, parsley, dill, and
  celery leaves. Cut the heart, lungs, and liver into small bite-sized cubes,
  and add them to the soup, and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the rice, cut-up
  intestines, aniseed, salt and pepper to taste and continue simmering until
  the rice is tender, approximately 15 minutes, adding more water as needed
  and the brains during the last few minutes of cooking.
  
  Half an hour before serving, bring the soup to a boil, then remove from the
  heat and prepare the avgolemono: Beat the eggs for 2 minutes. Continue to
  beat, gradually add the remaining lemon juice. Then 1 to 2 cups of the hot
  soup by droplets, beating steadily, until all has been added. Add the
  avgolemono to the soup.  Stir over minimum heat until thickened.  Serve
  warm but avoid boiling the soup after adding the avgolemono.
  
  A richer Mageritsa can be made by sauteing the scallions in 3 tablespoons
  butter or oil before adding to the soup.

 Categories: Italian, Sauces, Vegetables
      Yield: 7 servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil                                -tomatoes, peeled, seeded
      2 sm White onions, chopped                    -and diced, or

     18    Medium-sized very ripe plum       1/4 ts Dried hot red pepper
 
  One of the virtues of a marinara sauce is that it is so quick and easy to
  prepare, and light.  Saute' in the oil the onions, carrots, and garlic
  until onions are soft.  Mill in the black pepper, and add the tomatoes.
  Stir the sauce well, add the salt, and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Now
  push the sauce through a food mill.  It will emerge velvety. Melt butter in
  a pan and add the strained sauce.  Stirring often, cook for 15 minutes. For
  extra personality, at this stage you can stir in the hot red pepper. Makes
  7 cups.

      Title: Marzipan (Candies)
 Categories: Candies, German
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Almonds, shelled, blanched          3    Or 4 Tbsp rosewater or
      1 lb Confectioners' sugar                     -orangewater
      1 ea Egg white, unbeaten            
 
  Nothing expresses the German love of edible art more succintly than
  marzipan candies, which are shaped into piglets, cats, poodles, flowers,
  fruit and all sorts of other objects. They are delicious to eat, too.
  
  Carefully dry the shelled almonds, then grind to a powder in an electic
  blender, if you have one. Blend almonds, the sugar, the egg white and just
  enough rosewater or orangewater (available from pharmacies) to make a
  pliable stiff dough. Knead with fingers, then place on board dusted with
  confectioners' sugar and form into desired shapes, to resemble miniature
  apples, peaches, strawberries or, if you have an artist's touch, little
  pigs or birds. Tint with food coloring. Balls of marzipan may be rubbed in
  chocolate dots or colored sugar. If dough becomes too stiff, work in a
  little lemon juice, rosewater or orangewater, adding drop by drop.
  
  When candies are shaped, dry thoroughly in a cool, airy place for 24 hours,
  then wrap separately or place in a container (such as a little straw basket
  for fruit) and cover completely with Saran or other plastic wrap.
  
  Makes 2 pounds of candy.

      Title: Masa Sovada (Portuguese Sweetbread)
 Categories: Breads, Portuguese
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 c  Water (warm for dry;              1/2 ts Of salt
           -lukewarm for compressed)       5 1/2    To 6 cups all-purpose flour
      1 c  Scalded milk                        4    Eggs
      1 c  Sugar                                    2 packages yeast (active
      2 ts Cinnamon                                 -dry or compressed)
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine            
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Scald milk and add to sugar, butter and
  salt; stir until butter is melted.  Mix cinnamon and flour.  Add 1/2 the
  flour to the milk/sugar/butter/salt, and mix until smooth.  Beat 3 eggs and
  add them and the yeast to the mixture.
  
  Continue to add remaining flour to make soft dough.  Remove it from the
  bowl and place on floured board.  Knead until smooth and satiny (about 15
  mins.). Shape into a ball and place in buttered bowl.  Cover and let rise
  until double in size (2-1/2 to 3 hours).
  
  Punch risen dough down and divide it in half.  Place in two greased pans (8
  inches round).  Let rise in warm place until double in size (1-1/2 to 2
  hours).  Brush tops of dough with remaining egg (beaten).
  
  Bake in 350 degree oven for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on
  wire racks.
  
  NOTES:  I have found that if I initially heat up the oven and then turn it
  off, I put the dough in there to rise and it rises twice as fast.
  
  Also, I don't know if this violates any rules, but I've found that I prefer
  this bread with raisins added.
  
  Finally, as I mentioned to those who have gotten this recipe already, this
  bread makes the best toast in the world! (Personal opinion, of course..)

      1 qt Whipping cream                      1 tb White wine vinegar
           -(not ultra pasteurized)                 -=OR=- Lemon juice
 
  Makes About 1 Pound
  
  CHOOSE A STAINLESS STEEL BOWL that fits inside a large saucepan without
  touching the bottom of the pan. Add water to the pan and place the bowl in
  the pan so that the bowl touches the surface of the water but still sits
  firmly on the rim of the pan. Remove the bowl, place the pan on medium
  heat, and bring the water to a boil. Place the cream in the bowl and place
  over the boiling water. Adjust the heat under the pan to medium and heat
  the cream, checking the temperature often with an instant-read thermometer,
  to 190F; stir occasionally. Stir in the vinegar, continuing to stir gently
  until the cream begins to curdle. Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and
  allow the curds to firm up for 10 minutes. Line a strainer or colander with
  dampened cheesecloth, napkin, or coffee filters. Set the strainer or
  colander over a bowl and carefully spoon the curds into the strainer. Allow
  the mascarpone to cool to room temperature, cover the strainer tightly with
  plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 24 hours to allow the cheese to finish
  draining and become firm. Store in the refrigerator in a tightly covered
  container. Use the mascarpone within 3-or-4 days.

      Title: Melomakarona Andonias
 Categories: Cookies, Greek
      Yield: 48 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/2 c  Cognac
      7 c  All-purpose unbleached flour             -OR- mavrothaphne wine
           Extra flour for kneading                 -OR- ruby port
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda                         3    Oranges; zested and juiced
    1/4 ts Salt                                4 ts Freshly ground cinnamon
  1 3/4 c  Mild olive oil                  1 1/2 ts Freshly ground clove
  1 1/4 c  Sugar                             3/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg

-----------------------------------SYRUP-----------------------------------
      1 lb Honey; (1 lb = about 2 cups)        1    Clove
      1 c  Sugar                               1    Lemon; zested and juiced
      1    1-inch piece of cinnamon            1 c  Water

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Shelled almonds                     1 ts Freshly ground cinnamon
      1 tb Sugar                          
 
  Author's note: These cakes are traditionally served at Christmas.  This
  recipe comes from my neighbor, Andonia.  I have a distinct memory of her
  beating the oil and sugar into the flour until it dissolved using her
  middle finger and forefinger as a beater - though a spoon will do.
  
  Start by making the syrup.  Put the honey, sugar, cinnamon, clove, and
  lemon zest in a saucepan and add the water.  Bring to a boil and simmer for
  5-10 minutes.  Add the lemon juice, then chill.
  
  To blanch the almonds, plunge them into boiling water for 1-2 minutes,
  until you see signs of their skins loosening.  Then drain and slip or pop
  them from their skins onto a baking sheet.  Toast them in an oven preheated
  to 350 F for about 10 minutes - just until they begin to color. Cool, then
  chop them very, very finely - if you do this in a food processor, make sure
  that the pulses are short, or the nuts could turn oily. Mix the ground
  almonds with the sugar and cinnamon and reserve.
  
  Sift the flour, baking soda and salt together.  Put the olive oil and sugar
  in a large bowl and beat together - with your fingers like Andonia - or
  with a wooden spoon.  Beat in the Cognac, the orange zest, spices, and
  juice from 2 oranges (about 1/2 cup).
  
  Then beat in the flour, a few spoonfuls at a time, until you have a
  malleable dough, adding more flour if it is too soft, and more orange juice
  if it is too stiff.  Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for
  10-15 minutes until very smooth.
  
  Pinch off pieces of dough of about 2 tablespons and form into flattened
  oval or lozenge shapes.  Place them on an oiled or non-stick baking sheet.
  Bake in an oven preheated to 400-425 F for about 20 minutes, until brown.
  
  When they are cool enough to handle, dip them in the bowl of syrup for
  about 1 minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a tray to cool.
  Sprinkle with the chopped almond mixture.

 Categories: Desserts, Greek
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1 lb Commercial filo sheets

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      8    Apples*                             1 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Sugar                             1/4 c  Currants or raisins
    1/2 ts Cinnamon                          1/2 c  Walnuts
    1/2 ts Allspice                          1/2 c  Butter; melted

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      1 c  Powdered sugar                 
 
  *Note- Apples should be cored, peeled and chopped.  If desired, 2 cups
  canned apples (drained) may be substituted.
  
  Defrost frozen filo to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.  Mix filling in a
  bowl tossing ingredients with a spoon.  Set aside.
      Lay 5 sheets filo flat, one on top of each other, with a little melted
  butter brushed between the sheets.  Spread 1 cup of filling along one end.
  Roll filo over the apple filling so you will have a long filled tube. Fold
  side edges over 1/2" so filling won't fall out.  Continue rolling.
      Place in a buttered baking pan or cookie sheet.  Brush tops generously
  with melted butter.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  Sift powdered sugar
  over tops and sides as soon as it is taken out of the oven and while still
  hot.  When cool, cut into 2" pieces and serve. Source: "The Complete Greek
  Cookbook" by Theresa Karas Yianilos; Avenel Books, New York.

  Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add chopped
  tomato & next 12 ingredients; simmer for an additional hour or until peas
  are tender.  Discard bay leaves.  Ladle soup into bowls, and sprinkle with
  cheese.

  BEAN SOUP MIX:  Sort peas.  Combine peas, lentils and barley in a large
  bowl, stir.  Store in an airtight container.  (Makes 10 cups!!)
  
  NOTE:  Freeze extra soup in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw
  overnight in refrigerator.  To serve, place in a large saucepan, and cook
  over medium heat until thoroughly heated, stirring soup occasionally.

      Title: Morroccan Spiced Olives
 Categories: Moroccan, Hot, Appetizers
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Olives purchased from deli               -(green
           -or Middle Eastern grocery     
 
  Yield: 1 cup
  
  Olives are often served as part of the Middle Eastern appetizer assortment
  called mezze or mazza that is brought to your table with your wine, ouzo,
  or arak.  Anything can turn up as part of a mezze selection: octopus
  dressed in olive oil and lemon, chunks of feta cheese or salami on small
  pieces of bread, or a plate of creamy, tart hummus.  Olives, brined,
  salted, or marinated, are almost always on one of the little plates.
  
  Middle Eastern marketplaces feature huge vats and crocks of differently
  spiced olives in myriad array.  Some are fleshy, some juicy, others bitter
  and dense, and each is in a subtly different mainade.  The marinade in this
  recipe is good for almost any type of olive;  it is especially delicious
  with green brined olives or fleshy Greek-style ones (it even improves
  California-style ripe Olives).
  
  brine-cured, Kalamata, Greek-style, or shriveled black dry-cured) 1/4 cup
  olive oil 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tsp fresh rosemary leaves, lightly
  crushed 1 1/2 tsp Aji Harissa, Berbere, or commercial chile-garlic paste 1
  tbsp wine vinegar
  
  1.  Drain olives of any brine.
  
  2.  Slowly heat olive oil over low heat. Remove from heat and add garlic,
  rosemary, chile-garlic paste, and vinegar.
  
  3.  Pour marinade over olives and let stand at least 2 hours (the flavor
  gets hotter the longer it stands).
  
  ADVANCE PREPRATION:  Lasts almost forever, covered and refrigerated
  
  VARIATION:  A Mediterranean-inspired hors d'oeuvre.
  
  4 ounces Montrachet or Leazay goat cheese 1 to 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1
  tsp finely chopped cilantro (optional) 1 tsp medium salsa (or to taste) 1/2
  tsp thyme 1 tsp olive oil Approximately 1/2 a French baguette, cut into 1/2
  to 3/4 inch slices Morroccan Spiced Olives
  
  1.  Mash goat cheese with a fork.  Add garlic, cilantro, salsa, thyme, and
  olive oil.
  
  2.  Spread goat cheese mixture on bread slices; top each with half a pitted
  marinated olive.
  
  RECOMMENDED WINE:  Enjoy with a glass of a medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon
  with noticeable character, one from California, Chile, or Spain.

      2 tb Honey                          
 
  Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves into a large
  bowl, making a well in the center.  In a smaller bowl, beat the olive oil
  with the honey, petimezi, grated orange zest, and 1/2 the orange juice and
  pour into the well.  Mix together to make a dough, adding the remaining
  orange juice as necessary.
  
  Turn onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until the dough
  is smooth but not stiff.  Cover with a cloth and leave to relax for 30
  minutes or longer.
  
  Break off pieces of dough, about 2 tablespoonfuls each, and roll into
  snakes about 1/2-inch in diameter.  Press the two ends together, forming
  oval wreaths, and place on an oiled or non-stick baking sheet.  Bake in an
  oven preheated to 375 F for 10-15 minutes- until they are brown and
  crunchy, but not too hard.

      Title: Muggine in Bianco
 Categories: Fish/sea, Jewish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 lb Striped bass                      1/4 ts Whole peppercorns
      1 sm Onion, sliced                            Salt
      1    Carrot, sliced                           White pepper
      1    Stalk celery, coarsely              1 c  Home made mayonnaise made
           -chopped                                 -with olive oil
      1    Lemon sliced                   
 
  Fish must be absolutely fresh. Clean the fish well making sure the gills
  are removed from the head.  Separate the head from the body and remove all
  bones from fish.  Save head and bones. Place  onion, carrot, celery, one
  slice lemon and the peppercorns into a fish poacher.  Add the fish filets,
  the head and the bones.  Add cold water to cover and 1/2 tsp salt. Simmer,
  covered, for 10 - 20 minutes or until done. The fish is done when the eye
  pops out a little and the meat flakes.  Remove from heat. Carefully pick
  out any pieces of meat avoiding bones and vegetables and arrange inside a
  fish mold or on an oval serving plate. Lightly season with salt, white
  pepper and lemon juice. Strain the broth and return to the stove. Let it
  boil uncovered until the liquid is reduced to about a cup, then pour it
  over the fish and refrigerate until the gelatin is firm. To serve, unmold
  and cut in half lengthwise with a sharp knife. Then cut each half into four
  or five pieces diagonally forming a fishbone pattern. Mask the cuts under a
  swirl of mayonnaise so the effect looks like a whole fish. Cut the lemon
  slices and arrange around the fish to look like fins.

      1 c  Chopped green olives stuffed        3 tb Chopped fresh parsley
           -with pimientos                     2 tb White wine vinegar
      1 c  Pitted and chopped                1/3 lb Salami

  The roasted red peppers are Italian-style, available at many Italian delis.
  When you're ready for a sandwich the next day, assemble the following:
  
  One loaf fresh Italian bread (one big round for a monster, individual hero
  (grinder, sub,...) loaves will do fine for smaller sandwiches)
  
  Cut  the loaf (loaves) in half,  and scoop out a little of  the inside to
  make some room.   Drizzle some of the olive oil  and juice from the olive
  salad on each side of the open loaf -- use plenty. On the bottom, place
  some  salami,  olive  salad, provolone, mild cheese, and mortadella. Top
  with the other half loaf. Slice into wedges (or eat the individual loaves).

           Freshly ground black pepper    
 
  for garnish
  
  Soak the porcini mushrooms in 1/2 cup of warm water for about 30 minutes.
  Drain, reserving the liquid.  Rinse, dry, and chop the porcini mushrooms.
  Strain the soaking liquid through washed cheesecloth, paper towels, or a
  coffee filter.  Set aside.
  
  Melt the butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot over low heat.
  Add the onion and garlic.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is
  wilted but not browned, about 5 minutes.
  
  Add the porcini mushrooms and cook for 8 minutes.  Increase the heat to
  medium and add the fresh mushrooms.  Cook until the juices run, about 10
  minutes.  Add the reserved porcini soaking liquid and continue to cook
  until reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, salt, pepper,
  marjoram, and thyme; cook for 5 minutes.  Add the broth and simmer for 15
  minutes.

  oil.  Use more oil if necessary.
  
  In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks with the Parmesan chese, the pecorino
  romano cheese, and 3 tablespoons of chopped parsley.  Gradually whisk 1 cup
  of the hot soup into the egg yolks to warm them.  Reverse and slowly whisk
  the egg yolk mixture into the soup.  Cook, stirring constantly, over
  medium-low heat until the soup thickens.  (Do not boil or the soup will
  curdle.)
  
  Place a piece of toast in each of 8 bowls.  Ladle in the hot soup and
  sprinkle with additonal grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley.
  
  Serves 8.

      Title: Neapolitan Cauliflower Soup
 Categories: Soups/stews, Italian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Head cauliflower - large          1/4 c  Olive oil
           -(about 2 lbs.), cored and          4 c  Vegetable Broth - hot (see
           Separated into florets                   -recipe) OR canned
      2 tb White wine vinegar - OR                  Low-sodium chicken broth
           -cider vinegar                      2 ts Salt
      4    Clove garlic - minced             1/3 c  Parsley - flat-leaf, freshly
    1/2 ts Crushed hot red pepper                   -chopped
 
  Number of Servings:   6
  
  Pecorino cheese - freshly grated
  
  1.  Trim the stems from the cauliflower florets and cut them into 1/2 inch
  pieces, then break the florets into 1/2-inch pieces.  Fill a large bowl
  with 2 quarts of cold water and stir in the vinegar.  Add the cauliflower
  pieces and stir to clean thoroughly.  Bring a large saucepan of salted
  water to a boil over high heat.  Drop the cauliflower into the boiling
  water, return to a boil and cook over moderately high heat until just
  tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain the cauliflower thoroughly.
  
  2.  In a large saucepan, cook the garlic and hot red pepper in the olive
  oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is
  golden, about 3 minutes.  Add the cauliflower and cook for 5 minutes,
  stirring to prevent it from browning.  Stir in the hot Vegetable Broth,
  salt and parsley.
  
  3.  Using a slotted spoon, remove 1 cup of the cooked cauliflower from the
  soup and puree it in a blender or food processor until smooth. Return it to
  the soup, increase the heat to moderate and heat through. Ladle the soup
  into bowls and sprinkle on a generous amount of cheese.
  
  NOTE:  Make this soup as garlicky and spicy as you like and serve with lots
  of crusty Italian bread.
  
  Serves 6.

      2 lg Onions, sliced                      4    Hard-cooked eggs
      6 tb Butter                            1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1 cl Garlic, minced                           Wine vinegar
      3 lg Potatoes                                 Olive oil

     10    Pitted green olives            
 
  * NOTE: To prepare dried cod, soak in cold water for about 24 hours, or
  until it is completely moistened. Change the water two or three times.
  Drain thoroughly.
  
  Put the cod into a saucepan and add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a
  boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the fish is
  tender. Drain; remove skin and bones. Flake the meat with a fork into large
  pieces. Saute the onions in 3 tablespoons of butter until they are tender
  and golden in color. Add the garlic. Boil the unpeeled potatoes in salted
  water. When they are tender (about 20 minutes), remove from the heat, put
  under cold running water, and remove the skins. Drain and slice into
  1/4-inch pieces. Preheat the oven to 350 deg.F. Grease a 1 1/2-quart
  casserole with the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Arrange a layer of
  half the potatoes, then half the cod, then half the onions. Sprinkle with a
  little pepper and repeat the layering. Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the
  top layer. Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated through and lightly
  browned. Before serving, garnish the top with olives and eggs; sprinkle
  with parsley. Serve with the wine vinegar and oil in cruets and black

      1 c  Milk                                1 tb Chopped pimiento
      1 c  Water                               4    Hard cooked eggs
    1/4 c  Butter                                   Bread crumbs
      3 tb Flour                              12    Bread triangles fried in
      2 c  Heavy cream                              - Anchovy butter
 
  Soak finnan haddie in water to cover for 1 hour. Drain and put into a large
  saucepan, covering with the milk and water. Bring to a boil, remove from
  the heat and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. When cooled, remove the skin
  and bones, reserving the stock. Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed
  saucepan. Stir in the flour and cook over direct low heat until smooth. Add
  the cream and 1 1/4 cups of the reserved stock; continue to cook, stirring
  occasionally, until the mixture is slightly thickened. Season with pepper
  and nutmeg. When the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, remove it from
  the heat, measure out 1/4 cup, and set it aside. Break the finnan haddie
  into pieces and fold them into the sauce. Simmer gently over low heat for a
  few minutes until the fish is warmed. Pour the mixture into a shallow
  casserole; cover with the pimiento and sliced hard-cooked eggs and pour the
  reserved 1/4 cup of sauce over the eggs. Sprinkle the dish with bread
  crumbs and place under a hot broiler to brown. Serve with the anchovy
  toast. (The Mother Hunt) SOURCE: The Nero Wolfe Cookbook by Rex Stout The

      Title: Nikki's Eggplant Parmesan
 Categories: Vegetables, Italian, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lg Eggplant                                 -sliced
           Oil                                 2 c  Italian Tomato Sauce
    1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese, thinly         3/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Wash eggplant; do not peel.  Trim ends and cut eggplant crosswise into
  rounds 1/4" thick.  Place on broiler pan or baking sheet, brush surface
  with oil, and broil about 3" from heat 5 min, until lightly browned. Turn,
  brush uncooked side with oil, and broil 3 min on other side. Place single
  layer of cooked eggplant slices on bottom of 2 qt. baking dish (A deep
  casserole produces a thicker, creamier, multilayered dish; a shallow
  casserole gives fewer layers and a crustier top.  Take your pick.) Cover
  with single layer of mozzarella cheese, spoon over enough sauce to cover,
  and sprinkle generously with grated Parmesan.  Repeat layers until all
  eggplant is used, adding the Parmesan cheese layer every other time. End
  with tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese.  Any extra sauce can be poured over
  top layer if needed for moisture and will filter down during baking. (At
  this point the casserole can be refrigerated for several hours if you like
  to work ahead.  Remove from refrigerator and allow to come to room
  temperature  before baking or increase baking time 5 to 10 min.) Bake in
  350 F oven 15 to 20 min, until sauce bubbles and cheese melts. Serve from
  casserole with large cooking spoon, cutting cheese strands with scissors.

  1 1/2 c  :Boiling water                      1 c  Rye flour
      2 tb Butter                              1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt                                1 c  Whole wheat flour
 
  There are many different types of this flat bread. This version should
  remain soft rather than crisp (hence the name lefser, or soft cake).
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. In a large bowl, combine water, butter, salt, rye
  flour and all-purpose flour and beat well. Stir in whole wheat flour and
  beat until you have a smooth dough that resembles dough for a baking powder
  biscuit. Divide dough into 4 parts. Cut each portion into quarters. Flour a
  board and roll each piece of dough to make a thin 10- to 12-inch circle. If
  desired, use lefser rolling pin to make a pattern on the dough. Place 2 or
  3 dough circles on ungreased baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven 3 to 5
  minutes--NOT until completely browned. Cool on a rack. Wrap airtight.

      Title: Nut-Stuffed Semolina Pastries, Cyprus Style
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 30 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      3 tb Warm water (more if needed)
    1/4 lb Sweet butter                        1 c  Chopped unsalted pistachios
  1 1/4 c  Fine semolina                   4 1/2 tb Granulated sugar
           Orange flower water                 1 tb Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Salt                                     Confectioners' sugar
 
  In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the butter to bubbling over medium heat
  and stir in the fine semolina.  Transfer to a small bowl, cover, and let
  stand overnight at room temperature.  The next day, uncover and add 2
  teaspoons orange flower water, the salt, and gradually the warm water,
  working with your fingers to make a firm dough.  Knead for 5 minutes, then
  cover and let rest 1 hour.  Meanwhile, combine the pistachios, sugar, and
  ground cinnamon in a small bowl.
  
  Break off pieces of dough slightly larger in size than a walnut.  Work in
  your fingers to form a ball.  Press the center with your thumb to make a
  large well and fill with 1 teaspoon of the nut mixture, then cover over
  with dough and shape into an oval. Set on a cookie sheet and continue until
  all pastries are shaped.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to 35
  minutes or until the yellow color has become a light, not a deep, chestnut.
  Remove to racks and cool for 10 minutes, then dip quickly into orange
  flower water and roll in confectioners' sugar.  Cool before storing.
  
  Note: You may substitute blanched almonds for the pistachios and peanut oil
  for the butter.

  Yeast dough:
  
  Dissolve the yeast and some sugar in a bit of warmed milk. Mound the flour
  on a pastry board.  Make a well in the middle of the mound, and into it
  pour the yeast mixture.  Let rest for about 1/2 hour.  Then add the
  remaining ingredients - sugar, eggs, salt, butter, and milk.  Knead to mix
  well, and beat until the dough forms bubbles.  Cover the dough with an
  inverted bowl and let rise, in a warm place, for 1 1/2 hours.  Then cut off
  lumps of dough, and let those rise one more time, on the floured pastry
  board, for another 1/2 hour.  With your hands, stretch each piece of dough
  and cover with fruit (one kind only).  If you are using apples or damson
  plums, dust fruit with cinnamon and sugar, otherwise just with sugar.  Fold
  the dough over to enclose the fruit and arrange the dumplings in a baking
  dish with a buttered bottom (3 1/2 Tbsp butter per dumpling) .  Bake at
  medium heat for 35 to 40 minutes, until light brown.  Remove from oven and
  tip onto a board for cooling.  Brush with melted butter shortly before
  cooling.
  
  Serves 4.

      5    (scallions; chopped)                     - peeled, seeded & chopped
    1/3 c  Olive oil                                Salt & freshly ground pepper
 
  Beat, pound and rub the octopus from 20 to 30 minutes on a rough stone
  surface.  The octopus will feel softer and will secrete a grayish liquid
  after pounding.  Wash thoroughly, then drain and cook in a covered pan
  without adding water until the octopus turns bright pink-red and feels
  tender.  Using a sharp knife, cut into rounds the width of a small finger.
  Heat the oil in a tsikali or any pot, add the onion, and cook until
  translucent and soft.  Add the round octopus slices to the onion and pour
  in the wine, and simmer for 15 minutes.  Put the fennel and tomatoes on top
  of the octopus, season with salt and pepper to taste, and give the pot a
  good shake to mix.  Cover and simmer until the octopus is fork-tender
  (approximately 45 to 50 minutes).  Serve warm or cold.

 Categories: Veal, French, Sauces, Soups/stews
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 lb To 3 1/2 lbs boneless veal          1    Onion
           -shoulder cubed                     2    Egg yolks
      1 ts Salt                                2    Celery tops
      5 tb Butter                              1 c  Heavy cream
     18    Peeled white onions                 1    Leek
           Water                                    Salt
      1 lb Fresh mushrooms, quartered          1 ts Thyme
  6 2/3 c  Chicken stock                            White pepper
      2    Carrots peeled and cut into         1    Bay leaf
           -strips                             2 tb Finely chopped parsley
      1 ts Lemon juice                         4    Parsley sprigs
      3 tb Flour                          
 
  In a heavy casserole, blanch the veal by covering with cold water, bringing
  it to a boil over high heat and boiling  for one minute. Drain, and rinse
  under cold water.  Return  the veal to the casserole (which has been wiped
  clean) and add 6 cups of the chicken stock, carrots, onion, celery, leek,
  herbs  and  salt. The meat should be covered in  liquid;  if not, add more
  water.  Bring to a  boil  and  simmer  over moderate heat partially covered
  for 1-11/2 hrs  until  the meat is tender.
  
  Meanwhile, combine 2/3 cups of the chicken stock, 2  TB  of butter and the
  white onions in a skillet. Bring to  a  boil and simmer 15-20 minutes.
  Remove with a slotted spoon to  a bowel. Stir the mushrooms and lemon juice
  to the  remaining liquid in skillet. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for
  5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the mushrooms to the bowel with the
  onions. Pour all remaining liquid  into  the simmering veal.
  
  When  the  veal is done, remove from casserole. Strain  the stock through a
  fine sieve , return to casserole  and  boil until reduced to 1/2. In a
  small saucepan,  melt  3  TB  of butter and stir in flour. Cook this "roux"
  for 2 minutes and remove from heat. Pour the reduced stock in and blend
  with a whisk. Then return it to the heat, and cook stirring constantly
  until  the sauce comes to a boil  and  thickens. Simmer for about 10
  minutes. Remove from heat.
  
  In a bowl whisk together egg yolks and cream. Whisk in the hot sauce 2 TB
  at a time until 1/2 cup has been added. Then reverse the process and whisk
  the egg-cream-sauce  mixture into the hot sauce. (This is to prevent
  curdling.) Bring  to a boil in the sauce pan, season with salt and white
  pepper and a few drops of lemon juice.
  
  Place  the  veal and vegetables in the large casserole  and pour the sauce
  over. Toss and heat gently.  Sprinkle  with parsley and serve.

      Title: Pan Haggis
 Categories: Pork/ham, Lamb, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Pig's or lamb's liver               3 oz Pinhead oatmeal
      3    Onions                              1 ts Salt
      5 oz Minced suet                       1/2 ts Pepper
    1/2    Pt. water                      
 
  Simmer liver and onions in stock for 30-40 minutes. Put oatmeal in a heavy
  pan over heat or under the grill, and toast until nicely browned. When the
  meat is cooked, remove from pan, keeping liquid. Mince liver and onions,
  add oatmeal, suet, salt and pepper. Moisten with sufficient liquid to give
  a softish consistency, put in a greased pudding basin and cover with a
  double lid of foil, and steam for 3 hours.
  
  Now, you probably don't have a pudding basin (I'm not sure what one is).
  
  From "The Highlander's Cookbook," by Sheila MacNiven Cameron, here is an
  alternate method:
  
  Turn into a greased Pyrex bowl. Cover with two or three layers of foil.
  Steam on a rack in a pan of boiling water for two hours, adding more
  boiling water as it boils away.

      1    Garlic clove, peeled,                    - or chick bouillon
           -chopped                            6 c  Beef stock
      1 c  Anaheim green peppers,                   Salt to taste
           -seeded, chopped                         Pepper to taste
           -or:                                1 c  Sour cream
      1 c  Cubanelle peppers, chopped        3/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
 
      Heat a 5 qt heavy stove-top casserole and add the lard and paprika.
  Cook over medium heat for a moment and then add the garlic, green pepper,
  onion, and tomatoes. Simmer for a few minutes until all is tender. Add the
  chicken base and Beef Stock, along with the salt and pepper. Cover and
  simmer for 30 minutes.
      In a metal bowl, mix the sour cream and flour together. Mix it well
  with a wire whip as you do not want lumps. Add a cup of the gravy from the
  pot and quickly stir into the cream and flour with the whisk.
      Remove the gravy from the heat and stir in the cream mixture, whipping
  it well. Return to the heat and simmer, stirring often, for 15 minutes.
  Strain the gravy and discard the solids ... or lumps, if you have any.
  Yields: 7 cups Hint: To render lard.
      Yes, I know this is heresay in our time, but if you want the real
  flavor of Grandma's cooking you must render your own lard. Lard purchased
  from the market is not as flavorful.
      Tell your butcher you want fresh pork fatback, coarsely chopped, for
  rendering. Get 2 or 3 pounds. Place in a heavy kettle and add 1 cup of
  water. Set over medium heat until all is boiling and then reduce heat to
  medium low. Cook until the pork fat pieces have shrunk to small toasty bits
  and the fat is clear yellow, about 2 hours. Allow the fat to cool and store
  it in glass jars in the refrigerator. Hint: On the use of lard.
      I have very mixed feelings about fooling around with Grandma's recipes.
  Where she used lard, you and I should certainly feel free to substitute
  some other kind of oil... but we must admit that the final flavor will not
  be the same. Perhaps we should have it just once in a while. Recipe & Hints

  raisins.  Flavor with the seeds scraped from 2 vanilla beans and mix until
  the fruits are evenly distributed.  Line a pyramidal paskha form with a
  fine cheesecloth wrung out of cold water.  Pour the mixture into the form
  and fold the cheesecloth to cover the bottom of the cake.  Weight the
  cheese down well and allow it to drip for 24 hours.  A deep flowerpot with
  a hole in the bottom for drainage makes a satisfactory paskha mold. Unmold
  the paskha and decorate it as you wish.  Paskha is traditionally servied
  with kulich, the Russian Easter bread.

      Yield: 36 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      2 c  Stewed apricots
    1/2 lb Sweet butter                        4    Dried figs
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar                  1/3 c  Raisins
      2    Eggs                                1    Orange (grated rind only)
      6 tb Cognac                              1 c  Apricot jam
      2 c  All-purpose flour (or more)         1 tb Lemon juice (optional)
    1/4 ts Salt                                2 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Baking powder                     1/3 c  Orange juice
 
  Using an electric mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy and
  gradually add the sugar, 1 egg and an egg yolk, and 3 tablespoons of the
  Cognac, beating thoroughly after each addition.  Sift 2 cups of the flour
  with the salt and baking powder and add slowly to the batter, while beating
  on medium speed.  Remove the beaters and finish by hand, adding only enough
  flour to make a soft dough.  Knead.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 30
  minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, slice the apricots into uniform pieces and place in an enameled
  pan.  Soak the figs and raisins in the remaining Cognac until swollen, then
  mince and add to the apricots along with the orange rind, jam, and lemon
  juice and stir into the apricot mixture, then cook over medium heat until
  thick, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Cool.
  
  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and set aside about one-third for
  the latticed top.   Using your fingers (the dough will be too soft to
  roll), press the larger portion of dough into a buttered 9 x 12 x 2-inch
  baking pan, pressing evenly about 1/4-inch up the sides.  Pour the filling
  into the dough-lined pan.
  
  Divide the remaining dough into walnut-sized balls and roll each ball into
  1/2-inch strips.  Using the strips, make a lattice over the top of the
  pastry.  If using a glaze, beat the remaining egg white slightly with a
  fork and brush on the dough stips.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 45
  minutes, or until golden in color.  Remove and cool in the pan on a rack.
  To serve, cut into 1-1/2-inch (or smaller) squares with a sharp knife.
  
  Note: You may prefer to use peaches and peach jam, strawberries and
  strawberry jam, and so on, instead of apricots; also diced candied peel
  adds a colorful note when substituting for figs; and slivered almonds may
  be added to the filling.

  coarsely chop the parsley. 2) Heat oil over medium heat and saute chopped
  ingredients for about two minutes, without permitting them to color too
  much. 3)  Cut fresh tomatoes into 1 inch pieces. Add either fresh or canned
  tomatoes to the pan and cook for 25 minutes more, stirring occasionally. 4)
  Pass contents of pan through a food mill, using disc with the smallest
  holes. (Option: omit the food mill step if you prefer tomato "chunks.")
  Season with salt and pepper to taste. 5) Reduce sauce over medium heat for
  10 minutes and serve. to "chunks.") Season with salt and pepper to taste.

      Title: Pastitsio
 Categories: Casseroles, Greek
      Yield: 24 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      6 c  Saltsa Kima
  1 1/2 lb Ziti thick, uncut macaroni          6 c  Medium Saltsa Aspri
           Salt                                1 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 c  Grated cheeses*                   1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
      6 tb Melted butter                       1 c  Bread crumbs
      7    Eggs                           
 
  *Note: Grated cheeses can be any combination of mizithra, kefalotyri (hard
  ricotta) or Romano cheeses. In a large pot, boil the ziti in salted water
  until almost tender.  Drain thoroughly. In a large bowl, combine the
  macaroni, 1 1/2 cups of the grated cheeses, the butter, and 4 of the eggs,
  lightly beaten.
      Butter an 11" x 15" x 3" baking pan, and in it layer half the macaroni
  mixture.  Separate 2 of the eggs and combine the 2 egg whites plus 1 more
  whole egg with the Saltsa Kima.  Spread it evenly over the macaroni in the
  pan and cover with the remaining macaroni.  Meanwhile, combine the Saltsa
  Aspri with the 2 egg yolks and the spices.  Pour over the macaroni,
  spreading it into the corners with a spatula.  Sprinkle the top lightly
  with the remaining cheese and the bread crumbs.  Bake in a 350 degree for
  45 minutes or until a golden crust develops and the sauce bubbles.  Remove
  from the oven and allow to stand for 15 minutes before cutting into
  squares.  Serve on a warm platter. Note: Try this once using 1 1/2 pounds
  of ziti for an elegant pastitsio. A very rich recipe; you can safely reduce
  the meat sauce and Saltsa Aspri by one cup, if desired. From: "The Food of
  Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles.

      Title: Pasulj (Serbian Bean Soup)
 Categories: Soups/stews, Beans, Polish
      Yield: 5 servings
 
      1 lb Dried white beans (navy or          1 lg Carrot, scraped and sliced
           -cannellini)                        5    To 6 whole peppercorns
      2    Onions, chopped                     1 lb Kielbasa, thickly sliced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced             1/2 tb Salt
      3    Bay leaves                          2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Chopped parsley                     1 ts Paprika
      2 tb Tomato paste                        2 tb Flour
 
  You will need a large saucepan.  Pick over the beans for bits of grit and
  chaff, and rinse them twice in cold water.  Put the beans in a large
  saucepan and cover them with water to a depth of 1 to 2 inches.  Bring the
  water to a boil and then turn down the heat.  Leave to simmer gently for
  half an hour.
  
  Remove the pan from the heat and pour in enough cold water to cover the
  beans to a depth of 3 inches.  The beans will settle on the bottom.  Leave
  them for a minute or two; then pour off the water and replace with fresh
  water.  Bring the water to a boil and then turn down the heat to simmer.
  
  Add the onions, garlic, bay leaves, parsley, tomato paste, carrot, and
  peppercorns to the beans.  Cook gently over very low heat for 1 1/2 to 2
  hours, until the beans are soft.  After 45 minutes of the cooking, add the

      Title: Pepperoni Sticks - Italian Style
 Categories: Beef, Pork/ham, Italian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Salt                                2 oz Allspice
      5 oz Sugar                               5 oz Ground anise seed
      4 oz Cure                               10 lb Ice water
      2 oz Ground hot red pepper          
 
  Ingredients for 100 lbs.
  
  Meat in Pounds Boneless cowmeat 50 pounds, Beef cheeks 20 pounds, Beef
  flanks or plates 30 pounds.
  
  Grinding and Mixing: Grind all the meats thru a 3/16" grinder plate. Remove
  to mixer and add all the ingredients mixing evenly, regrind thru 1/8"
  grinder plate. The meat is now ready for stuffing. Stuffing:
  
  It is essential that the meat is well chilled to avoid smearing the meat.
  The meat should be stuffed into 24 to 26 mm lamb casings. Smoking:
  
  Preheat smokehouse to 125 degrees F and place pepperoni in smoker. Have
  dampers wide open without smoke until the casings are dry.  Close the
  dampers 1/4 open and apply a heavy smoke raising the temperature to 140
  degrees.  Hold this temperature until the internal temperature of the
  product reaches 130 degrees.  When using PORK, raise the temperature to 150
  degrees and hold until the internal temperatue reaches 138 degrees.  Remove
  from the smokehouse and chill with cold tap water until the internal
  temperature is reduced 105 degrees to 110 degrees.  Return to the cold
  smokehouse at 110 degrees and apply a heavy smoke for at least 12 hours or
  overnight.  Leave dampers 1/4 open.
  
  Drying: The drying room should be kept at 60 degrees to 65 degrees and a
  relative humidity of 70%.  The drying time will vary because of the amount
  of moisture that has been removed from the sausage during smoking.   It
  usually takes 3 to 4 days to make a satisfactory pepperoni.  When fully
  dry, the pepperoni will yield from 50 to 55% of the original product.
  
  Alternate Drying Method without smoking: Hold pepperoni at 70 degrees for
  about 2 days maintaining a relative humidity of about 75%. The product
  should be kept in a cooler for at least 20 days from the time the cure had
  been added to the pepperoni.  Be sure that casins used are not over 1-3/8"
  in diameter as this formula applies only to casings below this range.

      Title: Perogies

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 tb Butter                                   Sour cream
      1    Onion; sliced                 

-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      3 c  Flour;all purpose                 3/4 c  -water, approx.
  1 1/2 ts -salt                               4 ts Vegetable oil
      1    Egg                           

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 tb Butter                            3/4 c  Cheddar cheese; shredded
    1/3 c  Onion; finely chopped             1/2 ts -salt
      1 c  Potatoes; cold mashed             1/4 ts -pepper
 
  DOUGH: In bowl, combine flour with salt. Beat together egg, water and oil;
  stir into flour mixture to make soft but not sticky dough that holds
  together in a ball. If necessary, add 1 Tbsp more water at a time, being
  careful not to make dough sticky. Turn out dough onto lightly floured
  surface; knead about 10 times or till smooth. Halve dough, cover with
  plastic wrap or damp cloth. Let rest for 20 minutes. FILLING: Meanwhile in
  skillet, heat butter over medium heat, cook onion for 3 to 5 minutes or
  till tender. Transfer to a bowl, add mix in potatoes, cheese, salt and
  pepper. Working with one portion of the dough at a time, and keeping the
  remaining dough covered, roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/16"
  thickness. Using 3 inch round cutter, cut dough into rounds. Place 1 tsp
  filling on each round. Lightly moisten edge of one half of dough with
  water, pinch edges together to seal and crimp attractively. Place on cloth;
  cover with damp cloth to prevent drying out. Repeat with remaining portion
  of dough. In large pot of boiling salted water, cook perogies in batches,
  for 1 1/2 hr to 2 minutes or till they float to top, stirring gently to
  prevent perogies from sticking together or to bottom of pan. With slotted
  spoon remove to colander to drain. In large heavy skillet, melt butter over
  medium heat, cook onion for about 5 minutes till golden. Add perogies and
  toss to coat and warm through. Serve with sour cream. MAKES ABOUT 30
  PEROGIES.
  
  Variations: Cottage Cheese: Combine 1 cup press cottage cheese, 1 beaten
  egg, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and 1 Tbsp chopped green onion. Mushroom:
  In skillet, melt 2 Tbsp butter over medium heat, cook 3 cups chopped
  mushrooms and 1/3 cup finely chopped onion for 7 to 9 minutes or until
  moisture has evaporated. Remove from heat; stir in 1 egg yolk and 1 Tbsp
  chopped fresh dill. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

      4    Eggs                           
 
  Combine the flour, milk, eggs, salt, and - if desired - a little sugar, and
  stir into a dough.  Then mix in the melted butter. Grease a 'Pfitzauf' pan*
  and fill halfway up with the dough. Bake in a hot oven for 25 minutes until
  light brown, WITHOUT ever opening the oven door to check!  The 'Pfitzauf'
  gets dusted with sugar and is served with stewed fruit.

  substitute a muffin pan lined with paper cupcake holders.  The same recipe
  specifies 400 degrees F. K.B.))

    1/2 c  Sugar                               1 c  Pine nuts, chopped
      1 ts Vanilla                                  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Salt                                     Sweetened milk, optional
 
  CREAM BUTTER AND SUGAR together until very soft. Then carefully blend in
  the ground almonds, salt, vanilla and flour. The dough will be rather firm.
  Cut off pieces about the size of prunes and roll them into little
  cigar-shaped pieces about 1/2-inch thick. Roll these in the chopped pine
  nuts and bend them into a half-moon shape. Place these 1-inch apart on
  greased baking pans. Bake at 350F for 15-to-20 minutes. The crescents
  should not be browned. Cool about 5 minutes, then strew with a little
  granulated sugar or brush with heavily sweetened milk.
  
  NOTE: For reasons never adequately explained, cake and other baked foods
  need more flour on some days than on others.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1 lg Onion; finely choppped
  1 1/2 kg Fresh mussels                     1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Water                                    Freshly ground black pepper
           Salt                                2 c  Short grain rice
    1/4 c  Olive oil                         1/4 c  Chopped parsley
    1/4 c  Butter                                   Parsley sprigs, lemon wedges
 
  Serves: 6 Cooking time: 45 minutes
  
  Scrub mussels with a stiff brush, scraping shells with a knife blade to
  clean them thoroughly.  Tug beard towards pointed end to remove.  Place in
  a bowl of lukewarm salted water until mussels open.  If any are open to
  begin with, tap shell - if mussel does not close, then discard it.  While
  mussels are open, run lukewarm water into the bowl so that any sand can be
  expelled from the mussels.  Drain.
  
  Heat oil and butter in a deep pan and add onion.  Fry gently until
  transparent.  Add mussels, cover pan and cook for 5 minutes until shells
  open.  If any do not open, then discard them.  Add 3 cups cold water, wine,
  1 1/2 teaspoons salt and pepper to taste.  Cover pan and bring to a slow
  simmer.  Simmer gently for 10 minutes, then remove mussels with a slotted
  spoon.
  
  Wash rice until water runs clear, then add to liquid in pan with the
  parsley.  Bring to the boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat, cover pan
  tightly and cook over low heat for 15 minutes.
  
  While rice is cooking scoop mussels from shells and reserve.  Keep 6
  mussels in the shell for garnish.  Put shelled mussels on top of rice.
  Place two paper towels over rim of pan and fit lid on firmly.  Leave on low
  heat for further 5 minutes, then remove pan to side of stove and leave for
  10 minutes.
  
  Blend mussels through rice with a fork and pile pilafi in a dish.  Garnish
  with reserved mussels, parsley sprigs and lemon wedges.
  
  Note: 1/2 cup tomato puree (not paste) may replace 1/2 cup water for a
  different flavour.

 Categories: Greek, Vegetarian
      Yield: 12 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 lb Fresh greens *                    1/2 ts Nutmeg
           Salt (see note at end)              2 ts Granulated sugar
    1/2 bn Fresh parsley; chopped                   Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 bn Fresh dill; chopped                 5    Eggs; lightly beaten
      1    Handful fresh chervil; chop.        1 c  Crumbled feta cheese
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine               1/2 c  Milk, or more
      1 bn Scallions; chopped                1/2 c  Butter (optional); melted
    1/2 ts Ground allspice                    12    Commercial filo sheets
 
  Traditional and individualistic.  Village women learn to gather tender,
  young greens from their rocky surroundings, which ironically produce the
  most beautiful wild flowers and delicious greens.  When greens are bought
  in the markets, spinach is the most frequently substituted.  Cretans
  combine dandelions and spinach.  This recipe is written as recipes are
  spoken in Greece, in the warm first-person plural.
  
  *Note: Suggested greens are: Spinach, dandelions, chicory, endive or any
  other fresh greens.
  
  First we wash the spinach, trim coarse ends, drain, chop, sprinkle with
  salt, and squeeze until all liquid has been drained.  Now we combine the
  spinach in a large bowl with the parsley, dill, and chervil and mix
  thoroughly.  Allowing the greens to stand while heating the 1/4 cup butte
  in a large frying pan, we add the scallions to the butter and saute them
  until the white parts are translucent.  Continuing to cook over medium
  heat, we add the greens, the spices, sugar, and enough salt and pepper for
  seasoning, careful to allow for additional salt in the feta, which will be
  added later.  We partially cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes, or
  until all the liquid has been absorbed, then we remove it from the heat and
  cool the mixture in a large bowl.  Now we add the eggs, feta, and enough
  milk to saturate the greens, mix, and assemble the pita as follows:
  
  Butter a 15 x 11 x 2-inch baking pan.  Spread 6 filo sheets, brushing each
  with melted butter.  Pour in the filling, spreading evenly.  Cover with the
  remaining filo sheets, brushing each with butter.  Flute the edges and
  brush top with butter.  Using a sharp knife, score the top 3 filo sheets
  into square or diamond shapes.  Bake for 45 minutes in a moderate oven (350
  F) and allow to cool slightly before slicing and serving it warm.
  
  Note: You may eliminate the salting of the spinach by panning it, cooking
  over very low heat until the leaves wilt, and then draining it thoroughly.

 Categories: Breads, Italian, Pizza
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 oz Fresh yeast; -=OR=-               3/4 c  Warm water (125F)
      2 pk - Instant dry yeast granules      1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Milk; at room temperature           3 c  Unbleached white flour
 
  IN A LARGE BOWL, dissolve the yeast in a mixture of the milk and water. Mix
  in the flour and salt to make a soft dough. Knead 10 minutes by hand, or 4
  minutes in a heavy-duty mixer with a dough hook. Oil a clean bowl and set
  the dough in it, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise until
  doubled in bulk. (In the traditional warm place, this will take about 2
  hours. However, a cooler temperature will do as long as the dough has
  enough time to rise, including overnight in the refrigerator.) If the dough
  is ready sooner than it is needed, punch it down and refrigerate it or let
  it rise slowly again at room temperature until ready to use. When ready to
  use, divide into 4 equal parts. Roll 1 into an 8-inch round. Top with
  favorite toppings and bake 10 minutes in 450F oven.

  oil.  Mix well  with  a  spoon.  Continue stirring in the rest of the flour
  1/2 c at a time,  until  the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl.
  Flour your  hands and the work surface and kneed the ball of dough until it
  is no longer sticky.
  
  Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic  wrap, for 45 to
  60 minutes in a warm place, until it is  doubled  in bulk. Punch it down
  and kneed it briefly. Press  it  into  an oiled 15-inch deep dish pizza
  pan, until it comes 2 inches  up the sides and is even on the bottom of the
  pan. Let the  dough rise 15-20 minutes before filling.
  
  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
  
  While  the  dough  is rising, prepare  the  filling.  Cook  the crumbled
  sausage until it is no longer pink, drain it  of  its excess fat. Drain and
  chop the tomatoes.
  
  When  the dough has finished its second rising, lay the  cheese over the
  dough shell. Then distribute the sausage  and  garlic over the cheese. Top
  with the  tomatoes.  Sprinkle  on  the seasonings and parmesan cheese.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes at 500 degrees. Then lower the  temperature to 400
  degrees and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up  a section of the
  crust from time to time with a spatula to  check on its color. The crust
  will be golden brown when done.  Serve immediately.

      Title: Plainest Italian Sausage
 Categories: Pork/ham, Italian, Sausages
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8    Foot of sausage casing,           1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
           - packed in salt                    2 ts Fennel seeds
  1 1/2 lb Boneless pork                            - lightly crushed
    1/2 lb Fresh pork fat                      2 tb Dry red wine
      1 tb Salt                           
 
  SCRAPE THE LOOSE SALT OFF the sausage casing and set the casing in a bowl
  of cold water to soften for at least 30 minutes. (You will need only about
  4 feet of casing for this amount of meat, but it's useful to have extra in
  case of ruptures.) Cut the pork and fat into pieces that will go through
  your meat grinder and grind them, using the coarse blade. Mix the salt,
  pepper and fennel seeds thoroughly into the ground meat. (Hands are the
  best implement.) Then mix in the wine. Drain the casing, open one end
  gently with your fingers and run a stream of cold water into it, to flush
  any remaining salt out of the interior. Thread the casing onto the stuffing
  horn and fit the horn over the meat grinder. Feed the sausage meat through
  the horn, supporting the emerging tube of sausage with your hands to
  prevent rips. (Actually, sausage making is much more conveniently done with
  two people.) When all the sausage meat is in the casing, lay the filled
  tube on the work surface and pinch it at 4-inch intervals to produce
  individual sausage links. At the same time, fill and firm any air pockets
  in the casing. Tie off the links with kitchen string. Coil the sausages
  onto a plate and set it, uncovered, in the refrigerator to season for 48
  hours. Turn the sausages over once or twice during that time.

      Title: Po Valley Pumpkin Pie
 Categories: Italian, Desserts, Pies
      Yield: 12 servings
 
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour                 1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Sugar                             2/3 c  Sugar
    1/8 ts Salt                                1 ts Grund cinnamom
      5 tb Unsalted butter                     2 lg Eggs
      1 lg Egg                                 1 c  Almonds, ground
           FOR THE PUMPKIN FILLING           1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
      1    Fresh pumpkin, about 2            1/2 c  Candied orange peel
           -pounds, OR 1 can                   4 tb Unsalted butter, melted
           Solid-pack pumpkin (1 pound)   
 
  FOR THE PASTA FROLLA:
  
  For the Pasta Frolla:  Combine the dry ingredients and mix well. Rub in the
  butter until it is absorbed, making sure the mixture remains cool and
  powdery and does not become pastry.  Beat the egg and stir in with a fork.
  Continue stirring until the dough holds together, then knead it briefly,
  just until smooth.  Shape into a disk, wrap in plastic, and regrigerate for
  at least 1 hour, or until firm.
  
  For the Pumpkin Filling:  Cut the pumpkin into 2-inch dice, scrape away the
  filaments from the inside and peel off the skin.  Steam the pumpkin over
  simmering water for about 40 minutes, until it is tender.  Puree the
  pumpkin in a blender or a food processor fitted with a metal blade; cool.
  If the pumpkin puree is excessively watery, cook it, stirring constantly,
  over medium heat, preferably in a nonstick pan, to dry it out before
  proceeding.
  
  Measure 2 cups of the pumpkin puree (a little more or less won't matter)
  into a large mixing bowl.  Whisk in the salt, sugar, cinnamon, and eggs,
  one at a time.  Combine the ground almonds and cornmeal and stir into the
  pumpkin mixture.  Place the candied orange peel in a strainer, rinse under
  cold, running water, and chop it finely with a sharp knife.  (Oil the blade
  of the knife to prevent it from sticking to the peel.) Stir the chopped
  peel into the filling, then fold in the melted butter.
  
  To Assemble the Pie:  Roll the dough out on a floured surface into a large
  disk, about 14 inches in diameter.  Fold the disk of dough in half and fit
  it into a buttered 9-by-2-inch deep layer cake pan. Press the dough against
  the bottom and sides of the pan and trim the edges so they are even with
  the top of the pan.  Pour in the filling and spread it evenly.  The filling
  will be about 1/2-inch lower than the top of the pan.  Fold the excess
  dough at the rim inward so that it makes a border about 1/2-inch wide at
  the edge.
  
  Bake the pie in the lower third of a preheated 350 F oven for about 45
  minutes, until the filling is set and the dough is a light golden color.
  Cool the pie in the pan on a rack.  When the pie is completely cooled,
  place a flat plate or pan on top and invert.  Lift off the baking pan and
  replace it with a platter.  Invert again and remove the top plate or pan.
  Keep the pie loosely covered at room temperature before serving.
  
  Makes 10 servings.

  2 1/2 ts Salt, or to taste              
 
  "Recipes for this sausage are so variable that what passes for kielbasa in
  one area might be regarded as not authentic in another. The ingredients and
  pronunciation of kielbasa are as variable as are the vagaries of the spring
  weather, the time of year when kielbasa is traditionally made. This version
  uses pork, beef, and veal and makes five lb"
  
  1. Prepare the casings. 2. Grind the meats and fat together through the
  coarse disk. 3. Mix the remaining ingredients with the meat. 4. Stuff the
  casings and leave the sausage in long links. Lengths of eighteen inches to
  two feet are traditional. 5. Allow the sausage to dry in a cool place for
  three or four hours or refrigerate for twenty-four hours uncovered. 6. Cook
  by roasting in a 425~ F. oven for forty-five minutes. These sausages are
  also excellent grilled over a charcoal fire and eaten in a Kaiser roll,
  lathered with a spicy brown mustard.

      Title: Pollo Alla Diavola (Chicken Devil's Style)
 Categories: Poultry, Italian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Chicken, halved                     2    Lemons
    1/2 c  Olive oil                                Freshly ground pepper
      3    Dried red chilies, stemmed               Salt
           - and seeded                   
 
  On a stove burner, heat the olive oil in a small pan over medium heat.
   Add the chili pods and saute them until they are a deep, dark brown. Turn
  off the heat and cool the olive oil and throw away the browned chilies.
  (the alternative is to add Tabasco sauce to the oil to make it hot without
  cooking it) Crack the leg and wing joints of the chickens loose and spread
  them out, skin side up on a board or clean counter. Pound the chickens will
  with a meat mallet to flatten them out. Add the juice of 1 of the lemons to
  the seasoned olive oil along with 3 or 4 twists of pepper. Put the chicken
  halves in a big bowl, pour the seasoned olive oil over them and turn the
  peices over and over to coat them well. Let the chicken stand for 1 - 2
  hours, turning the halves from time to time. Start your charcoal grill.
  When your grill is heaped high with hot coals, put the marinated chicken
  halves on to cook, skin side down. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and a
  little more pepper, grill thoroughly, turning and basting with the
  remaining marinade.  The chicken is done when it is tender and has a dark
  brown crust all over (some spots may well be charred) You can use the
  broiler in your oven, but an oven broiler never seems to get hot enough. If
  you want to try, preheat the broiler, put the chicken as close to the flame
  or coil as possible and broil it, turning it frequently and basting it
  often.  Serve chicken hot with lemon wedges. From Time Life - The Good Cook

  Servings: 4 Notes: "I name this recipe for the beautiful and fascinating
  Cleopatra. I would have liked to serve this dish to her as she sailed down
  the Nile on her barge to "caper" with Anthony."
  
  DIRECTIONS: Heat the oil and butter in a large frypan. Dredge the chicken
  in the flour and saute for 3 minutes on each side. Add the green onions,
  tarragon, capers and cook for 5 more minutes. Pour in the wine, stock,
  brandy and cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
  Serve over rice or pasta with chopped parsley on top. (My notes: after
  adding & cooking the green onions, etc, remove the chicken from the pan.
  Add the brandy first, and simmer until reduced by about half. Then add the
  wine and beef stock and reduce slightly. Add the cream and return the
  chicken to the pan- simmering 5 minutes as above.)

  "I have never found out the origin  of this recipe or where its name comes
  from. However, it is particularly pleasant because of the contrast between
  the hot toasted bread (which is similar to the French toast) and the cold
  raspberries and cream."
  
  Sprinkle the raspberries with confectioner's sugar, crush them gently with
  a fork and set aside. Whip the cream until it is stiff. Place the sherry in
  one bowl and the lightly beaten egg yolks in another. Dip the bread slices
  first in the sherry and then in the egg yolks. Melt the butter in a frying
  pan and when it is hot, fry the bread on both sides until it is golden
  brown. Transfer the slices to a warm dish and sprinkle each side with a
  little cinnamon. Place a few of the raspberries on each slice of the
  toasted bread and cover with a dollop of cream. SERVES: 4-6

      Title: Pork Braised with Celery Avgolemono
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Pork/ham
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1    Bunch celery
      3 lb Lean shoulder or leg of pork        2 tb Flour
      4 tb Butter or margarine                 2    Egg yolks
      1    Onion; finely chopped           1 1/2    Lemons (juice only)
           Salt & freshly ground pepper             Parsley or celery leaves
      3 c  Hot water (approximately)      
 
  Wipe the pork with damp paper towels, then cut into 1-1/2 inch cubes (the
  fat and skin may be left on during the cooking and removed later).  Melt 2
  tablespoons of the butter in a heavy pan or Dutch oven.  Add the onion and
  cook until soft and transparent, then add the pork and cook, stirring, over
  medium heat until the raw meat color disappears.  Season with salt and
  pepper, add hot water to cover, then cover and simmer gently (or bake in a
  325 F oven) for 30 to 35 minutes, or until almost tender.  (The timing is
  important because the celery is to be added and cooked with the pork only
  until both are tender but not overcooked.)
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the celery.  Wash the stalks and scrape the heavy ones
  slightly.  Cut each stalk once lengthwise (if large) and then across into
  1-1/2 inch slices.  (Use the leaves as well, if desired, but a few might be
  saved for a garnish or an accompanying salad.)  Add the celery to pork and
  continue simmering 25 minutes until both are tender.  Using a slotted
  spoon, remove the pork and celery and place in a serving dish, first
  removing and discarding the fat from the meat.  Keep warm.  Skim the fat
  from the cooking liquid, then add water or boil down rapidly to make to
  make 1-1/2 cups.  Keep hot while you prepare the avgolemono.
  
  To prepare the avgolemono, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a
  pan.  Stir in the flour, and after cooking over low heat for 1 minute,
  gradually add 2 cups of the hot cooking liquid from the meat.  Stir until
  the sauce comes to a boil.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, beat the two
  remaining egg yolks and add the lemon juice, droplet by droplet, beating
  all the while.  Beat a little of the thickened cooking liquid into the yolk
  mixture, then add the yolks to the pan of hot liquid.  Mix well and cook
  over low heat until thickened.  Pour the hot sauce over the pork and
  celery, garnish with parsley or celery leaves and serve warm.
  
  Note: Celeriac may be substituted for the celery.  Use 2-1/2 pounds of
  celeriac, and peel, quarter, and cut it into 1/2 inch slices before adding
  it to the pork.  A little scraped, diced carrot may be added with the
  celery.

    1/4 c  Tarragon vinegar                         - and cut into 1-in rounds
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Pat the pork dry with paper towels and sprinkle with
  desired salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat
  on top of the stove. Add the pork, without crowding, and brown well on all
  sides. You may have to perform this operation in batches. Remove the pieces
  to a plate as they are brown. Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons fat.
  Reduce heat to low and replace the pot on the stove. Add the onion and cook
  5 minutes, scraping up any brown bits that cling to the pan. Add the flour
  and cook another minute, stirring. Add the wine, vinegar and broth and
  bring to a boil. Return the pork to the pot with any juices on the plate
  and add bay leaves and thyme. Cover tightly and transfer the pot to the
  oven. Cook for 1 1/4 hours, or until meat is barely tender. Remove the
  casserole from the oven and, using a slotted spoon, remove the meat from
  sauce and set aside. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve into a container
  and discard onions and herbs. Replace the meat in the pot, add horseradish,
  mustard, cream, lemon juice and parsnips. Cover and replace in oven for
  20-to-30 minutes or until meat is tender and parsnips are cooked. Remove
  from oven and serve with boiled potatoes or buttered noodles.

      Title: Portokalia Se Mavrothaphne - Oranges in Red Wine
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      2 c  Mavrodaphne or ruby port
      8    Navel oranges                       1    Bay leaf
    1/2 c  Sugar                               1    Clove
 
  Remove the zest of 2 of the oranges with a zester; or pare finely with a
  vegetable peeler, then cut into thin julienne strips.  With a very sharp
  knife, cut off the skin and outside membrane of all the oranges, so you
  have glistening orbs of golden pulp.  Do this over a bowl to catch escaping
  juice.
  
  Choose a saucepan just large enough to hold 2 oranges at a time and put in
  the escaped juice and remaining ingredients.  Dissolve the sugar and simmer
  for 5 minutes.  Submerge 2 oranges at a time and cook just long enough to
  warm them through - about 3 minutes.  If they bob up, place a small
  weighted saucer over them.  Remove to a serving dish and continue with the
  next pair until finished.
  
  Boil to reduce the syrup by half, drizzle over the oranges, and chill.

      Title: Portugal: Fish Stew (Caldeirada De Peixe)
 Categories: Fish/sea, Soups/stews, Portuguese
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Fish; whatever available or         1 pn Nutmeg
           - shellfish                       1/2 ts Ground allspice
      2 pn Salt                                3 ts Piri-piri sauce
      4 tb Olive oil                                - see recipe
      2    Onions; chopped                     1 sm Glass dry white wine
      8    Tomatoes; peeled & chopped          1    Handful coriander leaves;
      1    Green pepper; seeded &                   - chopped
           - chopped                           4    Slices of bread with the
      4 lg Cloves garlic; crushed                   - crusts cut off
 
  This is a real fisherman's stew, dependent on whatever the boats have
  brought in.  The spices and hervs give the dish its special Portuguese
  identity.
  
  Clean the fish and cut into fairly small pieces, removing as many bones as
  possible.  Sprinkle the salt over the fish and leave while you make the
  following sauce. Heat 2-3 Tbsp of the oil in a saucepan and stir in the
  onions, tomatoes and pepper. Cook gently until they start to soften, then
  put in the garlic, nutmeg, allspice and piri-piri sauce. Add the wine and a
  little water. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, then remove
  from the heat. Lightly oil the bottom of a shallow, ovenproff dish
  (preferably earthenware). Put in a layer of fish followed by a layer of
  sauce and sprinkle with coriander. Continue with these layers until the
  ingredients are used up. Cover the top of with the bread and sprikle well
  with the remaining oil or dot with a little butter. Cook in a pre-heated
  oven at 350 degrees F. for about 30 minutes or until the fish is tender.
  Serve with boiled or sliced and fried potatoes, bread and a slad to make a
  substantial main meal. If you cannot obtain coriander leaves, you can use
  fresh parsley instead, but this will alter the flavour of the dish.

      Title: Portuguese Roast Turkey
 Categories: Portuguese, Poultry
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1    (10-lb) fresh turkey                1 lb French or Italian bread
      2 lb Coarse (kosher) salt              1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter                   1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      3 tb Olive oil                       3 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 lg Garlic cloves                       2 lg Egg yolks
           - peeled and minced            
 
  REMOVE THE GIBLETS from the turkey for another use. Fill the neck and body
  cavities of the turkey with coarse salt, then rub the skin well all over
  with salt. Place the turkey and remaining coarse salt in a large deep
  kettle, adding enough cold water to just cover the bird. Set in a cool spot
  for 3 to 4 hours.
  
  TO PREPARE THE STUFFING: Put the butter and olive oil in a large heavy
  saute pan, or better yet, a kettle, and place it over moderate heat. When
  the butter is melted, add the garlic and cook for 3-5 minutes until limp.
  Meanwhile, tear the bread into small chunks. Add the bread and the fine
  salt and pepper and toss well. Pour in the chicken stock and beat hard with
  a wooden spoon until the mixture is pastelike. Turn the heat to its lowest
  point, cover the kettle and steam 15-to-20 minutes until the bread absorbs
  all the liquid. Add the egg yolks to the stuffing mixture and beat hard
  until smooth. Remove from the heat and reserve. Preheat oven to 400F. Drain
  the turkey and rinse several times in cool water so that all traces of salt
  are gone. Place the bird on the counter with the neck cavity facing you.
  With your hands, begin working the skin free from the breast. Proceed
  gently, taking care not to tear the skin. It's slow going at first, but
  once you begin to free the skin, the job goes quickly. Loosen it all the
  way down the bird to within about 1 inch of the tail end, down both sides.
  With your hands, push the stuffing bit by bit far down under the skin and
  continue, packing it in lightly, until the breast is covered with about a
  1-inch layer. Next fill the neck cavity, skewer the neck skin flat against
  the back to enclose, and truss the bird. Place the turkey breast-side up in
  a large shallow roasting pan without a rack and roast uncovered for about 2
  1/2 hours. Do not baste. When the bird is richly browned and a leg moves
  easily in the hip joint, remove from the oven. Let stand, uncovered, 20
  minutes. Drain drippings into a sauce boat and keep warm. Remove trussing
  string and skewers and serve at once on a warmed platter.

  I saw this in Bon Appetit yesterday and decided to keep it.  I'll bet a
  dollar to a doughnut that the recipe originally called for Linguica, but
  was changed to kielbasa for the masses.  If you can't find smoked Linguica
  or Kielbasa, Andouille would also be a good substitute. I hope to try this
  when it gets cooler (like October -- grin)!  Hope it appeals to you, too.
  
  Number of Servings:   8
  
  Combine all ingredients in large pot.  Bring to boil, stirring
  occasionally.  Reduce heat; simmer until thick, stirring occasionally,
  about 2 hours.  Season with pepper.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead;

      Title: Potato Gnocchi
 Categories: Italian, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      3 lb Boiling potatoes; -=OR=-          1/8 ts Nutmeg
  5 1/2 c  -Mashed potatoes                    1 ts Salt; or as desired
    3/4 c  Flour (or more)                          White pepper; to taste
      5    Egg yolks                         1/3 c  Olive oil
 
  USING UNCOOKED POTATOES, boil them, unpeeled, in salted water until soft.
  Or cook them in a microwave according to oven directions or bake in a
  conventional oven. Drain boiled potatoes. Peel potatoes when they are cool
  enough to handle and puree them through a food mill or potato ricer while
  still warm. Do not use a blender or food processor for this because it
  excites the gluten in the potato and makes a sticky mess. If using leftover
  mashed potatoes, place in a small pot and heat them until they are warm.
  Transfer potatoes to a mixing bowl, add the yolks and mix. Add nutmeg,
  salt, pepper and 3/4 cup of flour. Knead together and add the remainder of
  the flour if necessary, bit by bit, kneading until a slightly sticky
  consistency is attained. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Form the
  dough into sausage-like rolls about the thickness of your thumb. Cut into
  pieces about 1-inch in length. Using a fork, flatten the pieces so that the
  tines leave an imprint in the gnocchi. Keep a glass of water nearby to
  clean the fork. Meanwhile, fill a 3-quart pot with salted water and bring
  to a boil. Reduce heat so that the water is boiling at a gentle roll. Drop
  the gnocchi into the boiling water, about 16 at a time. They will sink to
  the bottom but will rise to the surface after a minute or so. Continue to
  cook for another 15 seconds. Immediately remove with a slotted spoon to a
  colander. Sprinkle with a little olive oil, mix gently and transfer to a
  heated platter. Continue until all the gnocchi are cooked. Serve the
  gnocchi ungarnished as a side accompaniment to roast meat or poultry.

      Title: Potato Pancake Bread (Lompe)
 Categories: Breads, Pancakes, Ethnic
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      2 lb (6 medium sized) old                1 tb Salt
           -potatoes (the older, the         1/4 lb (1 cup) flour
           -better)                       
 
  This excellent soft pancake wrapper, easily made at home, is eaten in
  Norway with butter and 'geitost' cheese, or used to wrap delicious little
  morsels of smoked ham, 'fenalar', dried and salted leg of mutton, or a
  spoonful of berry conserve.
  
  You will need a griddle or a heavy frying pan, or best of all, a 'takke'.
  Boil the potatoes in their skins.  Peel them as soon as they are cool
  enough to handle and immediately mash them with the salt.  Speed makes
  light pancakes.  Mix with the flour into a dough.  (Less or more flour may
  be needed - potatoes are very variable.  The less flour you use, the
  better.)  Form into a long sausage and chop of lengths.  Roll these pieces
  out into pancakes about 1/8 inch thick.
  
  Bake the 'lompe' on a hot iron surface.
  
  Yield:  Makes 10 to 12 small pancakes Time: 1 hour

  Chop and pound to a paste any fragments of cooked ham, tongue, poultry,
  game or fish. With ham use a quarter part of fat. Remove all gristle and
  skin and pound until free from any fibre and reduced to a paste. Season
  highly with salt, pepper, cayenne, and made mustard, and moisten with a
  little melted butter (except ham, which has fat enough). Pack closely in
  small stone or earthen jars. Put jars in steamer and heat for one half
  hour. Then press the meat down again and cover with hot melted butter. This
  will keep some time and may be served in slices or used for sandwiches. Ham
  and tongue may be mixed with veal or chicken. Beef, game and fish are
  better alone. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine Old Recipes,

      8 oz Small onions (pickling size)             Salt, black pepper
      8 oz Button mushrooms                  1/4 pt White burgundy
           I oz butter                         2 lg Egg yolks
      1    Long branch tarragon or           1/2 pt Double cream
      1    Sprig each thyme, rosemary,    
 
  Serves 6
  
  Wipe the chicken inside and out with a cloth wrung out in boiling water.
  Cut into 10 serving pieces: 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings and 2 breasts
  halved. Scrape the carrots and peel the onions. Wipe the mushrooms with a
  damp cloth and trim the stalks. Melt the butter in a heavy iron cocotte
  [heavy frying pan or Dutch oven. S.C.] over low heat and when foaming add
  the pieces of chicken, the carrots and onions, and the herbs tied together.
  Season with salt and pepper, add the wine, cover and cook for 30 minutes,
  moving the ingredients around occasionally to prevent colouring. When the
  carrots and onions are tender remove them with a slotted spoon, cover and
  keep hot over a pan of boiling water.
  
  Slice the mushrooms finely, add to the pan, sprinkle with salt, cover and
  simmer for a further 20 minutes. Beat the egg yolks into the cream and set
  aside.
  
  Remove the chicken from the pan to a heated serving dish, place the
  vegetables around it in small groups, cover with foil and keep hot.
  
  Using the back of a fork, work the meat residue from the bottom of the pan
  into the cooking juices. Bring to boiling point, remove the herbs, and draw
  the pan from the heat. Add a tablespoon of pan juices to the cream, stir
  well and return this mixture to the pan, stirring constantly until thick.
  Pour imme- diately over the chicken and serve without delay.
  
  The excellent sauce of this dish is best appreciated when accompanied by
  plain noodles or boiled rice.

  is tender when pierced with a knife, about 25 minutes. Remove, sprinkle on
  the Parmesan cheese and run the dish under the broiler just until the
  cheese is lightly colored, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, watching carefully. Remove
  and sprinkle on the parsley, and serve.

      Title: Psari Spetsiotiko - Fish, Spetsai Style
 Categories: Greek, Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                           - peeled and chopped
      2 lb Fish                              1/4 c  White wine
           -(snapper, porgy, mullet,                - (more if necessary)
           -OR any favorite), cleaned          4    Garlic cloves; sliced
           -and left whole or sliced         1/2 ts Granulated sugar
           -into steaks                             Salt
      1    Lemon; juiced                            Freshly ground black pepper
           Salt                                1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/3 c  Olive oil                                Bread crumbs
      4    Ripe tomatoes                            Tomato juice, if necessary
           -(fresh or canned)             
 
  Wash and dry the fish (if using dried cod be sure it was soaked overnight),
  then sprinkle with salt and lemon juice, particulary inside the neck area
  if using fish with heads on.  Arrange on a baking-serving dish and set
  aside while you prepare the sauce.
  
  Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the tomatoes, wine, garlic, and sugar and
  simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.  (The amount of garlic may be reduced, but it
  *IS* the most important ingredient.)  Season with salt and pepper.
  
  Sprinkle the fish with a light coating of bread crumbs and then with the
  chopped parsley, then spoon the hot sauce over the fish.  Repeat the
  procedure until all the sauce has been used, ending with a topping of bread
  crumbs.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to 40 minutes, depending on
  the size of the fish, basting twice with the sauce.  (A golden crust will
  form on the fish, characteristic of this famous style.) During the baking
  period, add some wie or tomato juice if necessary; some sauce should remain
  around the fish.  Serve hot.
  
  NOTE: This makes an excellent first course with dry white Demesticha or
  Samos wine.

      Title: Puliszka - Polenta with Feta Cheese
 Categories: Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Corn meal, polenta                  4 oz Feta cheese
      2 c  Water                               8 oz Sour cream
      4 oz Butter                              1 tb Dill, chopped
 
  Cook Polenta in slightly salted water. Add butter. Stir it well. When all
  water disappeared, add feta cheese and sour cream but do not stir to well,
  and do not cook it anymore. The cheese and the sour cream should not be
  blended in the polenta, but vaguely mixed in. Before serving heat it up in
  the oven, sprinkle freshly chopped dill on top. This is a delicious dish!
  
  You can also top it with fried onions: slice large purple or white onions
  in thin rings, fry them without anything in hot oil or butter until dark
  brown and crisp, drain it, salt it and sprinkle on the polenta.

      Title: Pumpkin Walnut Phyllo "Snails"
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers
      Yield: 20 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      1    Pumpkin (4 to 4 1/2 lbs.)           1 lb Commercial phyllo sheets
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar                  1/2 c  Olive oil or butter; melted
      2 tb Ground cinnamon                
 
  Cut the pumpkin in half, remove and discard the seeds, the peel using a
  sharp knife.  Grate the pumpkin on the medium holes of a cheese grater
  (there should be approximately 4 cups of finely grated pumpkin).  Taste for
  flavor, adding more sugar if desired.  Start to roll the "snails". Lay the
  phyllo flat and deep, covered with a damp towel except when rolling. Brush
  one filo sheet lightly with the oil and fold in half lengthwise. Spread a
  row of filling (about 3 to 4 tablespoons) across the length of one end of
  the filo to within an inch of each edge.  Roll up to seal the filling,
  forming a long tube.  Then, beginning at one end, curl up tightly into a
  "snail-like" coil and set on a baking sheet.  Continue until all the
  filling has been used, keeping the rolls covered with waxed paper or
  plastic to avoid drying.  Brush the rolls with oil or butter and bake in a
  350 degree oven for 25 minutes or until puffy and crisp.  Serve warm or
  cold with poultry or game dishes.  From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma

------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
      2 oz Golden raisins                      2 oz Pine nuts
      2 tb Breadcrumbs                         1    Lemon; grated peel only
      4 tb Butter                              1    Orange; grated peel only
      4 oz Walnut meats                        2    Egg yolks
      1 oz Blanched almonds                    1    Egg white
      1 oz Candied citron                           Granulated sugar
      1 oz Candied orange peel            
 
  One of Italy's very special Christmas and New Year's dishes is this rich
  nut-and-fruit pastry, sometimes spelled "Putitza" or "Putizza."
  
  DISSOLVE THE YEAST in 1/4 cup milk. Add 1/2 cup flour and knead into a soft
  ball. Cover this with a towel and let it rise in a warm place. When it has
  doubled in bulk, add it to a bowl containing the rest of the flour, the
  sugar, eggs, melted butter, pinch of salt and grated lemon peel. Mix in
  enough milk to make a supple dough; knead well. Cover with a towel and let
  rise until doubled in bulk. Put the raisins in a small bowl and cover with
  hot water; let soften, then drain.
  
  Saute breadcrumbs in 3 tablespoons butter. Finely chop walnuts, almonds and
  candied fruits. In a large bowl, mix together the raisins, pignoli, grated
  lemon and orange peel, chopped nuts and fruits, sauteed breadcrumbs and 1
  egg yolk. Whip the egg white into soft peaks and fold it into the mixture.
  Preheat oven to 375F. Butter a baking sheet. Roll dough into a sheet
  1/8-inch thick. Spread filling over it, leaving 1 inch clear at the edges.
  Roll it into a cylinder and coil it on the baking sheet like a snail shell.
  Beat the remaining egg yolk in a small bowl and paint the surface of the
  dough with it. Sprinkle it with sugar and bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until
  pastry is firm and golden brown.

      Title: Rafiola Kokokarion (Coconut Pastries W/ Glaceed Fruit)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 20 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      2    Egg yolks
      3    Potatoes                            4 c  Finely shredded coconut
      3 tb Granulated sugar                1 1/2 c  Glaceed fruit
      1 pn Salt                                     Confectioners' sugar
 
  (Author's note): In a Cretan zacharoplasteion (sweet shop), we were so
  intrigued by these coconut pastries (among the newer breed) that I tried
  them at home. You can expect the potato pastry to be a bit difficult to
  manipulate, and you can also anticipate compliments on the results.
  Attractive and tasty, not excessively sweet.
  
  Boil the potatoes in their jackets until fork tender, then drain and remove
  the skins and all spots. Return the potatoes to the pan and dry over medium
  heat, shaking pan constantly. Push the potatoes through a mill or ricer,
  then combine in a large bowl with the sugar and salt. When somewhat cool,
  add the egg yolks and coconut and knead until smooth. Refrigerate for 2
  hours.
  
  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and knead until smooth enough to
  roll. If sticky, dust lightly with flour. Roll out on a floured board to
  1/4-inch thickness, then, using a glass with a 3-1/2-inch diameter, cut the
  pastry into rounds.
  
  Meanwhile, mince the glaceed fruit. Place 1 tablespoon on the center of
  each of the pastry rounds. Lift one side with a spatula and fold over the
  other half, forming a half-circle. Press the edges together and place on a
  baking sheet. Continue until all have been stuffed, then bake in a moderate
  oven (350 F) for 15 minutes, or until firm; the pastries will be white.
  Remove and cool for 10 minutes, then roll in confectioners' sugar and cool
  completely. Store in a covered container.
  
  Note: In Crete this pastry is cut with a serrated pastry cutter producing
  an attractive edging.

 Categories: Sauces, Pasta, Italian, Veal
      Yield: 12 servings
 
    1/2 oz Dried porcini mushrooms             3 tb Olive oil
    1/2 lb Lean veal shoulder                  1 tb Salt
    1/2 lb Lean beef round or shin           1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
  2 1/2 oz Pancetta or blanched bacon        1/2 c  Dry red wine
      4 oz Large yellow onion              2 1/2 c  Drained canned plum tomatoes
      1 lg Carrot                            1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 lg Celery stalk                             Freshly grated parmigiano
      5 tb Butter                                   Freshly ground pepper
 
  This takes a fair amount of time to make, but it freezes very well, so make
  a large batch. This is enough for 2 1/2-to-3 pounds of pasta.
  
  PUT THE PORCINI in a small bowl. Pour boiling water over them and let them
  sit for 30 minutes. Drain them, rinse carefully, chop coarsely and rinse
  carefully again. With a food processor or meat grinder, finely chop first
  the veal and beef, then the pancetta, onion, carrot and celery. Saute the
  pancetta and minced vegetables in the butter and oil in a heavy-bottomed
  casserole for 2 minutes over medium heat. Turn heat to very low, cover and
  continue cooking 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover the pot and
  raise heat to medium high. Add the beef, veal, mushrooms, salt and pepper.
  Cook, stirring constantly, until the meats just begin to lose their raw red
  color. Then pour on the wine and cook until it is entirely evaporated. Set
  a food mill with the medium blade over the pot and mill in the tomatoes.
  Stir everything together and simmer, covered for 40 minutes. If possible,
  complete preparation to this point several hours in advance, or even the
  night before you plan to use the sauce. Take it off the stove and let it
  cool if not serving immediately. Transfer to container. Cover and
  refrigerate. The sauce may also be made to this point and frozen. Shortly
  before serving time, bring the sauce slowly to a simmer. Simmer 5 minutes.
  Stir in the heavy cream and serve immediately over freshly cooked pasta,

      Title: Raisin Soda Bread
 Categories: Breads, Irish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  4 1/4 c  All-purpose flour (up to 4          1 tb Caraway seeds
           -1/2 cups)                          1 c  Dark seedless raisins
      4 ts Baking powder                       2 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 ts Baking soda                              Butter
      1 ts Salt                                     Sugar
      3 tb Granulated sugar               
 
  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Grease a 9-inch black cast-iron skillet or cake
  pan and dust with flour.
  
  In a large bowl, mix 4 cups of the flour with the baking powder, baking
  soda, salt, sugar, and caraway seeds.  Add the raisins, mixing them in with
  your fingers to make sure they are separated.  Add the buttermilk to the
  bowl and mix with a fork until the mixture forms a dough.
  
  Sprinkle about 1/4 cup more of the flour on a board or counter. Turn out
  the dough and knead for about 5 minutes, working in the flour from the
  board and forming the dough into a smooth round loaf about 8 inches in
  diameter.  (If the humidity is high and the dough is very sticky, you may
  need to add another 1/4 cup of flour to the board.)
  
  Press the dough evenly into the prepared skillet or pan and cut a cross 1/2
  inch deep across the top.  Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the
  loaf sounds hollow when rapped on the bottom.  Remove the loaf to a wire
  rack and rub the top with butter.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Let the bread cool
  completely before slicing.
  
  This Irish bread tastes even better the second day and is particularly good
  for breakfast.
  
  Makes one large loaf.

      Title: Raspberry-Filled Sandwich Cookies (Luxembourgli)
 Categories: Cookies, Swedish
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Blanched almond slices            1/8 ts (scant) almond extract
           -(about 4 ounces)                        FOR THE RASPBERRY
      1 c  Powdered sugar                           -BUTTERCREAM:
    1/2 c  Egg whites (4 to 5),            6 1/2 tb Unsalted butter, slightly
           -completely free of yolk                 -softened
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar                1 1/4 c  Powdered sugar
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar                   1/3 c  Seedless raspberry preserves
    1/4 ts Vanilla extract                          -or jam
 
  FOR THE COOKIES:
  
  Heat the oven to 325F.  Line 2 very large baking sheets (or 3 smaller ones)
  with baking parchment.  Toast the almonds in the oven, stirring
  occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until tinged with brown. Set aside to
  cool.  Reset the oven to 300F.
  
  Grind the cooled almonds and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar in a food processor
  until very fine but not oily.  Thoroughly stir the remaining powdered sugar
  into the almonds.
  
  Combine the granulated sugar and 3 tablespoons of hot tap water in a small
  heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.  Bring just to a boil, stirring.
  Cover the pan and boil for 1 1/2 minutes to allow the steam to wasu the
  sugar crystals from the sides of the pan.  Uncover and continue boiling,
  lifting the pan and swirling the contents occasionally, but never stirring,
  for about 1 minute longer until the syrup thickens, bubbles vigorously, and
  reaches the firm ball stage (240 F on a candy thermometer).  To test for
  doneness without a thermometer, remove the pan from the heat and drop a
  small amount of the syrup into a cup of ice water; let stand for 10
  seconds.  The syrup should form a firm ball when squeezed between the
  fingers.  Set the syrup aside.
  
  Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until frothy.
  Add the cream of tartar, raising the mixer speed to high. Continue beating
  just to soft peaks; turn off mixer.  Return the syrup to the burner and
  reheat just to simmering.  With the mixer on high speed, immediately pour a
  thin, steady stream of syrup down the side of the bowl (avoid the beaters
  or whip as the syrup will stick) until all of the syrup is added.  Add the
  vanilla and almond extracts.  Continue beating until the mixture cools to
  lukewarm.
  
  Use a rubber spatula to fold the almond mixture evenly into the beaten egg
  whites.  Immediately drop the mixture from small spoons into 1-inch kisses
  spacing about 3/4 inch apart on the parchment lined baking sheets.
  (Alternately, pipe the mixture into 1-inch rounds using a pastry bag fitted
  with a plain or open star 3/8-inch diameter tip.) Place the pans staggered
  on racks in the center half of the oven.  Bake for 19 to 22 minutes,
  reversing pans from front to back and switching racks about halfway
  through, until barely tinged and firm on top but still slightly soft
  inside.  Let the pans stand on wire racks until the meringues are
  completely cooled.  Peel from the paper.  Store aiftight until assembled.
  
  To prepare the buttercream:  Beat togather the butter, powdered sugar, and
  preserves until light and fluffy.  Spread with a knife (or pipe using a
  pastry bag and tibe) small amounts of the cream over the flat sides of half
  the cookies.  Top with the r4emaining meringues, pressing together tightly.
  Store the cookies airtight and refrigerated for up to 24 hours; they will
  soften too much if left longer.  (For longer storage, freze, tightly
  wrapped, for up to 2 weeks; thaw just before serving.) Allow the cookies to
  warm up slightly before serving.
  
  Makes about forty 1 1/4-inch sandwich cookies.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Round steak or lamb                 1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Fine bulgar                         1    Olive oil
    1/2 ts Cumin                          
 
  Put bulgar in a bowl and cover with warm water.  The water should cover the
  bulgar and be about 1 inch above the bulgar.  Let soak until water is
  absorbed and bulgar is soft.(about 1/2 hour) Remove ALL fat and membranes
  from meat(I prefer beef) and grind twice. Combine meat, bulgar, cumin, and
  salt.  Mix by hand until throughly mixed. Pat kibbee onto a platter or

  Place meat and vegetables in saucepan and cover with cold water. Add salt
  and pepper as required and flavor with a few parsley sprigs and add carrot
  slices. Slowly bring to a boil and skim off the top. Simmer over a very low
  heat for approximately 2 hours or until the meat is tender. Note:You can
  probably substitue lamb for the mutton and not need to cook as long. Also
  this kind of dish is good for buffets as soups and stews keep well and
  don't suffer for extended simmering.......8-)

  This is a Finnish soup.
  
  Use any cut salmon or steelhead, leaving skin on.  In 1 quart water, with
  salt and pepper, simmer on low heat in 5- or 6-quart pot.  When skin comes
  off easily, set aside on plate and remove skin and bones.  Cut or break
  into 1- and 2-inch pieces.  In liquid stock, place bay leaves and whole
  allspice.  Add potatoes, cut in 1- or 1 1/2-inch pieces; carrots, cut
  lengthwise and into half circles about 1/4-inch thick; and 2 onions cubed
  coarsely (not chopped fine).  Cook over low heat.  After a short while, add
  red cabbage and celery leaves.  Stir.  Cook until carrots are almost tender
  and potatoes don't disintegrate.
  
  While this is cooking, dice bacon and cook in fry pan over low heat. Pour
  almost all fat off.  Add butter (or margarine) and diced celery, remaining
  onion (diced fine) and green pepper.  Saute' until onions are yellow and
  peppers are pale green.  Now back to your pot.  Add salmon pieces, (they
  should be not quite cooked).  From now on everything is simmered on low to
  preserve body.  Add clams with broth, shrimp and 1 quart water. Put in
  stuff from fry pan.  Add pimento, mushrooms, rosemary, cumin, thyme,
  oregano and chilies.  Stir in milk a cup at a time. Add butter and let
  whole bit simmer for at least one hour.  Serve with tossed salad and garlic
  bread.  Can be frozen.

  2 1/2 c  Granulated sugar                    1 c  All-purpose flour
      3 c  Cold water                          1 c  Fine semolina
      1 sm Cinnamon stick                      3 ts Baking powder
      3    Whole cloves                        1 c  Finely chopped almonds *
      1    Orange (peel only)                  1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 lb Sweet butter                        2 tb Brandy
      6    Eggs; room temperature         
 
  dNote: Use blanched, peeled almonds.
  
  Combine 1-1/2 cups of the sugar with the cold water in a saucepan and cook
  until dissolved, then add the cinnamon stick, cloves, and orange peel and
  simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove the flavorings.  Cool.
  
  Using an electric mixer, beat the butter in a large bowl until fluffy.
  Gradually add the remaining sugar, beating on medium speed, then add the
  eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition, without
  rushing.  Meanwhile, sift the flour, semolina, baking powder, and almonds
  together.  Very gradually add to the batter, beating on medium speed, then
  pour in the vanilla and brandy and give the batter a last whirl on high
  speed for a few seconds.  Pour immediately into a buttered 9 x 12 x 3-inch
  cake pan and bake on the center rack of a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to
  35 minutes, or until the cake springs back when touched by a finger. Remove
  from the oven and set the pan on a cake rack.  Using a sharp knife, score
  the cake into diamond shapes.  Spoon the cooled syrup over the entire cake
  and cool.
  
  Note: Each piece may be attractively garnished with a candied or marachino
  cherry slice in the center and almond slivers angled on each side.

      2    Lemons; zested and juiced         1/4 ts Almond extract
 
  Make the syrup ahead.  Combine the sugar, lemon zest and juice, and water
  in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil, simmer for 5 minutes then add the almond
  extract.  Remove and chill overnight.
  
  Line a 10-inch-square cake pan, that is at least 3-inches deep, with
  parchment.  Sift together the flour and baking powder, then stir in the
  semolina.  Beat the egg yolks, sugar, olive oil, lemon zest, and almond
  extract together until pale and creamy.  Beat in the flour mixture,
  splashing with orange juice to moisten it.
  
  Wipe a mixing bowl with a cloth moistened with vinegar, then put in the egg
  whites.  Beat with the cream of tartar until stiff peaks form, then fold
  into the batter.  Pour into the pan and sprinkle with the almonds.
  
  Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F for about 45 minutes until golden brown.
  Remove from the oven and, while still hot, cut into squares. Slowly pour
  the chilled syrup over it.

      Title: Revani (Semolina-Almond Sponge Cake with Syrup)
 Categories: Greek, Cakes
      Yield: 20 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      6    Eggs; room temperature
  2 1/2 c  Granulated sugar                    1 c  All-purpose flour
      3 c  Cold water                          1 c  Fine semolina
      1 sm Cinnamon stick                      3 ts Baking powder
      3    Whole cloves                        1 c  Finely chopped almonds *
      1    Orange (peel only)                  1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 lb Sweet butter                        2 tb Brandy
 
  *Note: Use blanched, peeled almonds.
  
  Combine 1-1/2 cups of the sugar with the cold water in a saucepan and cook
  until dissolved, then add the cinnamon stick, cloves, and orange peel and
  simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove the flavorings.  Cool.
  
  Using an electric mixer, beat the butter in a large bowl until fluffy.
  Gradually add the remaining sugar, beating on medium speed, then add the
  eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition, without
  rushing.  Meanwhile, sift the flour, semolina, baking powder, and almonds
  together.  Very gradually add to the batter, beating on medium speed, then
  pour in the vanilla and brandy and give the batter a last whirl on high
  speed for a few seconds.  Pour immediately into a buttered 9 x 12 x 3-inch
  cake pan and bake on the center rack of a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to
  35 minutes, or until the cake springs back when touched by a finger. Remove
  from the oven and set the pan on a cake rack.  Using a sharp knife, score
  the cake into diamond shapes.  Spoon the cooled syrup over the entire cake
  and cool.
  
  Note: Each piece may be attractively garnished with a candied or marachino
  cherry slice in the center and almond slivers angled on each side.

      Title: Riceballs
 Categories: Italian, Rice/grains
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 c  Long grain rice                   1/4 c  Tomato sauce
      4 c  Water                             1/4 lb Diced mozzarella
    1/2 lb Chopped meat                        3    Eggs
    1/2    Medium onion; chopped               1    Tomato sauce for color
      1    Salt & pepper to taste              3 tb Grated cheese
      1    Garlic powder to taste              1    Garlic powder to taste
    1/4 c  Peas                                1    Salt, pepper, parsley
 
  Wash and drain rice.  Boil water in saucepan over high heat. Add the
  drained rice and bring to a boil.  Stir once, reduce heat to low, cover and
  simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente and slightly
  sticky, about 17 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
  Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and
  saute until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the chopped meat and seasoning and
  saute until the meat just loses its raw color, about 5 minutes longer. Add
  the tomato sauce and peas and cook until the liquid evaporates and the peas
  are just tender, about 10 minutes longer for fresh peas, or about 5 minutes
  for thawed. In a mixing bowl, beat 2 of the eggs. Add the cooled rice and
  the grated cheese and seasonings.  Scoop about 3 Tbl of the rice mixture
  into the palm of one hand (wet hands first) and press it out to form an
  even round.  Place about 1/2 Tbl of the meat mixture and one small chunk
  mozzarella in the center of the patty, then gently close your hand to
  encase the filling in the rice. Use both hands to roll the stuffed rice
  into a ball.  Continue making balls until all ingredients are used. Beat
  the remaining 1-2 eggs in a small bowl and pour the bread crumbs into a
  small bowl. Roll each rice ball in the egg to coat completely, then roll in
  the bread crumbs to cover well. Set aside until all balls are coated. Pour
  oil in a deep fryer or saucepan to a depth of 4 inches. Heat to 360F.
  Carefully drop the rice balls, a few at a time, into oil and fry, turning
  frequently, until golden brown all around, about 5 minutes. With a slotted
  utensil, transfer to paper toweling to drain. If desired, place in a low
  oven to keep warm until all are cooked. Serve warm.

      Title: Rich Cream - Kaymaki
 Categories: Greek
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1 qt Heavy cream
 
  Thick rich eastern Mediterranean "kaymaki" (literally, "frothy cream") is
  unique, but two more readily available products have a similar flavor and
  texture.  Imported English clotted (Devon) cream and Italian mascarpone
  cheese both make good substitutes, or you cna make your own.  Make this
  when you plan to be in the kitchen for a couple of hours - for an even
  smooth texture and a thick crust you need to stir the hot cream at regular
  intervals.  Be sure to use meticulously clean utensils and keep the cooking
  heat very low (or use a heat diffuser mat).  Kaymaki should be made at
  least 18 hours before you need it; it can be stored for up to a week.
  
  Slowly bring the cream almost to a boil in a heavy saucepan, stirring
  occasionally with a wooden spoon.  Reduce the heat to as low as possible,
  or place the saucepan on a heat diffuser mat.  Lift a ladleful of cream
  about 12 inches above the saucepan, and pour it back in a thin steady
  stream; repeat 2 or 3 times.  Repeat this procedure every 10 minutes or so
  over the next 1-1/2 hours, and stir the cream occasionally to make sure it
  does not stick.
  
  Leave the cream undisturbed over the lowest heat for 30 minutes longer; it
  will have reduced by at least two thirds.  Remove the saucepan from the
  heat and let cool.
  
  Loosely cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside for 2 hours.
  
  Remove the kitchen towel, tightly cover, and refrigerate for at least 12
  hours, or overnight.
  
  Cut the crust on top of the cream into 1-inch-wide strips.  Gently fold one
  end of a strip over the handle of a wooden spoon and roll it up (cut in
  half if the roll becomes too thick or unwieldy), and slide off onto a
  plate.  Repeat with the remaining strips.  The remaining kaymaki will have
  the texture of thick airless cream.  It can be refrigerated in a tightly
  covered container of up to 1 week; refrigerate the rolls for up to 3 days.
  
  Note: Serve kaymaki rolls on their own or with desserts such as Kataifi Nut
  Rolls or Almond Cake.  Kaymaki cream can be added to ice cream or rice
  pudding for an especially good flavor.  Or whisk it together with a little
  sweet wine or lemon juice for a perfect accompaniment to fresh or poached
  fruit or sweet pastries.

      Title: Rigani Cheese Bread
 Categories: Breads, Greek
      Yield: 12 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      2 tb Dried rigani; crumbled
      1 tb Active dry yeast                  1/2 tb Dried mint; finely crumbled
      1 c  Tepid (110 F) water               3/4 lb Feta cheese; well drained,
      3 tb Olive oil                                - finely crumbled
    1/2 ts Fine-grain sea salt                 1    Egg yolk; beaten with:
      3 c  Whole wheat flour, or more          2 tb Warm water
 
  Sprinkle the yeast over the water and set aside in a warm place until
  foamy, about 10 minutes.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the
  salt.
  
  Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the center, and
  pour in the yeast mixture.  Knead 10 minutes, adding additional flour if
  necessary to make a firm elastic dough.  Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl,
  tightly cover with plastic wrap, and set aside for 2 hours in a warm
  draft-free spot.
  
  Knead in the rigani, mint, and feta until evenly distributed throughout the
  dough.  Lightly oil a heavy baking sheet and place the dough in the center.
  Form into a round loaf and flatten to a thickness of 2 inches. Cover with a
  clean kitchen towel and set aside for 1 hour in a warm draft-free spot. The
  dough will rise only slightly.
  
  Heat the oven to 350 F.
  
  With a sharp thin blade, slash the top of the loaf diagonally in 2 or 3
  parallel lines, brush with the remaining olive oil, and bake 25 minutes.
  Brush with the beaten egg yolk and bake 15 minutes longer, or until the
  bread is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

  butter and the grated Parmesan cheese. Season with additional salt to taste

      Title: Roast Fresh Ham, Tudor Style
 Categories: Londontowne, Pork/ham
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Fresh ham or fresh pork           1/2 ts Ground cloves, or 1 teaspoon
           -shoulder, whole or half,                -whole cloves
           Bone in or boneless                 1 tb Whole allspice, or 1
      2 lg Onions, chopped                          -teaspoon ground allspice
      2 lg Carrots, chopped                    1 tb Grated orange zest
      2    Stalks celery, including            1 tb Black peppercorns
           -leaves, chopped                    1 lg Bay leaf
      3    Cloves garlic, chopped                   Salt, to taste (optional)
      1 ts Brown caraway seeds             1 1/2 c  Red table wine
      1 ts Black caraway seeds (if not       1/2 c  Red wine vinegar
           -available, use brown)            1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 ts Celery seed                       1/2 c  Cognac (optional)
      2 ts Ground cinnamon                
 
  Trim every bit of fat possible off the meat and discard.  Place the meat in
  a large non-metal container.
  
  Mix all of the other ingredients together and pour over the meat. Marinate
  the meat in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or up to 8 days. Turn the
  meat several times during marination so that no section is allowed to
  become dry.
  
  When ready to roast, transfer the meat to a large heavy roaster pan (an
  enameled iron roaster with a lid would be ideal).  Remove the bay leaf,
  peppercorns, whole allspice and whole cloves (if used) from the marinade
  and pour the marinade over the meat.
  
  Roast the meat in a 350 F oven, basting frequently.  Allow 30 to 40 minutes
  per pound.  The inside temperature should be 165 F to 175F as measured with
  a meat thermometer.  Remove the cover during the last 1/2 hour. You should
  be able to "cut with a fork" when done.  If the pan becomes too dry, add
  additional red wine and/or water, 1/2 cup at a time. You will want at least
  1 cup of liquid remaining in the panwhen the roast is done.
  
  Transfer the roast to a carving platter and allow it to cool slightly
  before carving.  If desired, serve surrounded with small baked apples or
  spiced crab apples.
  
  HUNTER'S SAUCE:  Strain the liquid and vegetables from the roasting pan.
  Transfer the vegetables to a food processor or blender.  Return the liquid
  to the roasting pan and skim off as much fat as possible.  Add 1/2 cup of
  hot water to the pan and bring to a boil over high heat, scraping up the
  particles adhering to the pan.  Reduce the liquid to 1 cup.
  
  Puree the vegetables in the food processor or blender.  Add the reduced
  cooking liquid and blend until smooth.  Transfer to a small saucepan and
  bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  If the sauce is too thick, thin to
  the desired consistency with hot water.  Serve in a silver or pewter
  pitcher, bowl or sauceboat.

      Title: Rolled Buttery Lemon Cookies (Mailanderli)
 Categories: Cookies, Swedish
      Yield: 50 servings
 
    1/2 c  Butter, slightly softened (1             Lemon
           -stick)                         1 3/4 c  All-purpose or unbleached
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar, plus more              -white flour
           -for garnishing                     1 lg Egg yolk beaten with 1
      1 lg Egg                                      -tablespoon water
           Finely grated peel (yellow               For glazing cookies.
           -part only) of 1 large         
 
  Grease several baking sheets and set aside.  With a mixer at medium speed,
  beat the butter in a large mixer bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in the
  sugar until well blended and smooth.  Beat in the egg and lemon peel.  With
  the mixer at low speed, beat in the flour just until evenly incorporated.
  
  Divide the dough in half.  Place each portion between large sheets of waxed
  paper.  Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to a scant 1/4 inch thick.
  Check the undersides and smooth out any wrinkles in the waxed paper.  Stack
  the rolled portions on a tray or baking sheet. Refrigerate for about 20
  minutes or until cold and firm, but not hard.
  
  Heat the oven to 375F.  Working with one chilled portion of dough at a time
  (keep the other one chilled), peel away a layer of waxed paper. (This makes
  it easier to lift the cookies from the paper later.) Replace the paper and
  turn the dough over.  Peel of the second layer of paper. Using a 2-inch
  round or scalloped cutter (or a small juice of sherry glass) cut out the
  cookies.  Use a spatula to carefully lift the cookies from the paper and
  place them about 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Reroll the dough scraps
  between waxed paper; rechill in the refrigerator. Repeat the process with
  the second portion of dough.
  
  Working with a few cookies at a time, brush the tops with the egg
  yolk-water mixture using a pastry brush or paper towel.  Sprinkle the tops
  lightly with granulated sugar.  Repeat until all of the cookies are
  garnished.
  
  Bake the cookies for 6 to 9 minutes or until the top is just tinged with
  brown and slightly darker at the edges.  Let cool on the baking sheets for
  about 2 minutes.  Transfer to wire racks and let stand until thoroughly
  cool.  Store airtight for up to a week.  Freeze for longer storage.
  
  Makes 50 to 60 cookies.

  Servings: 4 - 6 as a sandwich
  
  QUAN    MEAS    ING **
  
  For the Pizza Dough
  
  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  Soften the yeast in the water. Stir in the oil, then the flour and salt.
  Knead dough on a floured board until smooth and elastic (about 20 minutes).
  Shape into a round ball, cover with plastic and refrigerate 1 hourl
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Shape the pizza dough into a ball and then
  roll out into a large oval shape (about 24 inches long). About 2 inches
  behind the front edge, spread the pesto in a long stripe, stopping just
  short of the ends.
  
  Just behind and overlapping the pesto, place a layer of the ham slices,
  then a layer of cheese then the coppacolla, peppers and pepperoncinis. You
  should still have about 2 inches of dough showing at the back edge.
  
  Beat the egg and brush on the back edge and ends of the dough.
  
  Roll up Calzone as firmly as possible (so no air gets inside). Tuck the
  ends in and finish with the back edge on the bottom, not on the side.
  
  Place on a baking sheet pan sprinkled with corn meal, brush with egg white
  and bake in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes.
  
  Cool to room temperature and slice.  Can be sliced thin for appetizers
  
  NOTE: To roast peppers, preheat broiler.  Slice the peppers in half
  lengthwise. Core them and remove the seeds and ribs. Lay the pieces skin
  side up on a flat broiling pan and place the pan 3 - 4 inches below the
  heat.  Broil the peppers until the skins are charred (they should be
  black).  Then place the peppers in a plastic bag, seal it with a twist tie
  and set aside.  Let peppers steam in the bag for 15 minutes. Remove the
  peppers from the bag and slip off the charred skins.

  sea salt, then place the eggplants in a stainless-steel or other
  non-aluminum colander and squeeze out as much water as possible. Allow to
  drain in the colander for 30 minutes. Blot up any excess moisture with
  paper towels. Cut the eggplant flesh into 1 1/2 inch cubes. Place the cut
  eggplant in a glass or ceramic bowl and, stirring continuously with a
  wooden spoon, slowly add the safflower and olive oils and remaining 1/2 tsp
  sea salt. Stirring, add the milk. Spread out the eggplant on a large plate,

      Title: Rosti (Swiss-Style Potato Cake)
 Categories: Swedish, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Potatoes (see below)            1 1/2 tb Water or milk
      3 oz Butter, lard or bacon fat      
 
  This is a favorite dish of German-speaking Switzerland. Besides being
  served as a side dish with meat or fish, it is sometimes eaten on its own,
  for lunch or even breakfast, with milky coffee.
  
  The potatoes should be boiled in their jackets the day before. These should
  be waxy potatoes of the potato-salad kind. The next day, peel them and
  grate them on the coarsest blade of the grater. Heat a large heavy frying
  pan, and let the fat get hot: then put in the potatoes, sprinkle with salt,
  and fry, turning them constantly. When they have soaked up the butter or
  whatever, add more. Now form a "cake" by pushing the potatoes from the
  edges of the pan into the middle and flattening down the top.
  
  Sprinkle with the water or milk, reduce heat, and cover with a lid or
  inverted dish. Shake the covered pan occasionally to keep the potatoes from
  burning, and leave on low heat for at least 15 minutes. The potatoes must
  stick together, but not to the bottom of the pan. When cooked, turn the
  cake out onto a plate, bottom side up, and serve. (Or alternately, brown
  the other side as well.) . Variations: (1) Saute 2 T chopped onions in the
  fat before adding the potatoes. Don't let them brown. Also note that in
  this version, the potatoes will need less fat. (2) Saute 2 - 3 1/2 oz.
  diced bacon before adding potatoes. You won't need any extra salt. (3)
  Sprinkle cooked potatoes with grated cheese before serving, and heat it
  briefly in the oven to melt it.

      Title: Rough Puff Pastry
 Categories: Londontowne, Desserts
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8 oz Plain (all purpose) flour           6 oz Margarine
      1 pn Of salt                             6 tb To 8 tb cold water
 
  1. Sieve the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. 2. Cut the margarine into
  small pieces (size of a walnut). Add to the flour and toss lightly with the
  fingertips so that each piece of margarine is coated with flour - but not
  broken up. 3. Add 6 Tablespoons water and mix lightly with the blade of a
  knife into a soft dough, making sure that the pieces of margarine are kept
  whole.  If some of the flour is loose in the bowl, add a little more water
  and mix until it is worked in and the dough fairly soft. 4. Gather together
  with the fingertips, turn out onto a well-floured board and again sprinkle
  with flour. 5. Form into a small oblong, flour the rolling pin and roll
  lightly and carefully to a strip approximately 10 inches by 5 inches. 6.
  Brush off any surplus flour. Fold into three by folding the bottom third
  upwards and the top third downwards and over to cover it. 7. Lightly press
  the three open edges with the rolling pin to seal.
  
  Second Rolling:
  
  8. Turn the pastry round on the board so that the right hand edge faces
  you. Roll out to a strip approximately 9 inches by 6 inches. 9. Brush off
  any surplus flour. Fold into three again and seal the edges. Place on a
  floured plate; sprinkle with flour; cover with a damp cloth or plastic bag
  and leave in a cold place for 20 minutes.
  
  Third and Fourth Rollings:
  
  10. Repeat stages 8 and 9 for the third rolling (the resting period can be
  omitted) and again for the fourth rolling. (If the dough is streaky and
  rough in appearance, give it a fifth rolling. 11. After the last rolling
  and final resting, the pastry is ready to roll to the thickness stated in
  the recipe used.
  
  Following is the recipe for Eccles Cakes, using this pastry.

 Categories: Greek, Meats, Veal
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      2    Eggs; separated
      2 tb Butter or margarine             1 1/2 c  Thick Saltsa Aspri
      1 sm Shallot or onion                  1/2 c  Grated mizithra cheese
  1 1/2 lb Veal, ground                             -OR- kefalotyri cheese
    1/2 c  Chopped tomatoes                  1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
           -OR- tomato juice                        Heavy greaseproof paper
      1    Cinnamon stick; -OR-                     -(about 20 by 20 inches)
      1 ts -Ground Cinnamon                   12    Filo pastry sheets
           Salt; if necessary                1/3 c  Butter or margarine
           Freshly ground black pepper              - melted and warm
      1 ts Chopped fresh basil                 2    Eggs, hard-cooked; sliced
           -(more if desired)                  1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
 
  Heat the butter in a large frying pan, then saute the onion until soft. Add
  the meat, mashing it with a fork until the raw color disappears.  Add the
  tomato and cinnamon, cover and simmer about 20 minutes, stirring once or
  twice.  Remove the lid and season judiciously (if the cheese is salty,
  don't add salt until the very end).  Stir in the basil, then remove the
  cinnamon stick and cool.  Using a wooden spoon, mix the egg whites into the
  meat.  Meanwhile, prepare the saltsa aspri (it must be thick) and combine
  with the egg yolks, cheese, and nutmeg.  Taste to see if salt is needed.
  
  To make the loaf, spread the baking paper flat on your work surface.  Lay a
  sheet of filo (keeping the rest covered with a damp towel or waxed paper)
  in the center of the paper and brush with butter.  Continue laying filo,
  one sheet on top of another, brushing each with butter, to make a large
  "base" on which to roll the meat loaf (about 15 x 15 inches). Spread half
  of the saltsa aspri in the center of the filo, alowing wide margins for
  turning later.  Spread the meat mixture over the sauce to a length of about
  9 inches. Lay the egg slices over the meat, cover with the remaining sauce,
  and sprinkle with parsley. Turn the edges of the filo up over the meat and
  roll into a loaf.  Fold the paper over the loaf, secure it, and place, seam
  side down, in a baking pan.  Bake for 1 hour in moderate oven (350 F),
  removing the paper after 35 minutes to allow the filo to get crisp. Brush
  the outer surface of the filo with butter or margarine for a higher golden
  chestnut color.
  
  With wide spatulas, lift the loaf onto a warm platter.  Serve immediately,
  with fresh green salad, black olives, and a heady wine.

      Title: Rugalahs
 Categories: Jewish, Chocolate, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 96 servings
 
      1 lb Unsalted butter, cut into 1         2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
           -inch cubes                         1 c  Finely chopped hazelnuts or
      4 c  Flour                                    -walnuts
      1 lb Cream cheese                        1    Egg
      1 c  Raspberry or apricot jam          1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Packed brown sugar                1/2 c  Coarse sugar or finely
      3 tb Cinnamon                                 -chopped nuts
 
  Although this recipe can be halves, it's worth making mounds of these melt
  in your mouth cinnamon crescents, since they freeze perfectly and thaw
  quickly. Rugalahs can be frozen either baked or unbaked. To bake frozen
  rugalahs, allow an extra five minutes cooking time.
  
  In large bowl, using pastry blender or 2 knives, cut butter into flour
  until mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. Cut in cream cheese until
  dough feels moist. Knead dough until you can gather into large ball.
  Divided into 8 pieces. Wrap individually and refrigerate at least 1 hour or
  overnight. (Let dough stand at room temperature for about 15 minutes before
  rolling)  In medium bowl combine brown sugar, cinnamon and cocoa. Stir in
  hazelnuts.  Set aside until ready to use. On lightly floured surface, roll
  each piece of dough into circle 10 inches in diameter. Spread about 2 tbsp
  jam over each circle; sprinkle with some brown sugar mixture. Cut circle
  into 10-12 equal wedges. Roll up each one from outside, curving slightly to
  form crescent.  Place about 2 inches apart on greased or parchment lined
  baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining peices of dough. Beat together egg and
  salt and brush it onto each cookie. Sprinkle with coarse sugar or nuts.
  Bake in 350 F oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden. Makes 96 crescents.

  Salmon coulibiac is a traditional Yule holiday dish in Russia because it
  looks like a present: red (salmon) and green (spinach), all gift-wrapped in
  puff pastry. This dish would also be ideal on a New Year's Eve or Twelfth
  Night buffet. Here's a salmon coulibiac from Just Off Melrose caterers in
  Hollywood.
  
  Cucumber-Dill Sauce (recipe follows)
  
  Place 2 (15xl2-inch) puff pastry sheets side by side on floured board. For
  each puff pastry, spoon 1/4 Rice Filling evenly over center of each pastry.
  Add Mushroom Spinach Filling evenly on top of rice mixture. Distribute
  flaked salmon evenly over mushroom mixture. Top each with remaining Rice
  Filling.
  
  Beat egg with half and half in small bowl to make egg wash. Brush edges of
  pastry with egg wash. Fold pastry lengthwise, overlapping edges. Tuck ends
  to seal. Turn over, seam-side down, onto greased baking sheet. Make cutouts
  from remaining (lOx4-inch) puff pastry sheets, using pastry cutters. Place
  on top and sides of pastry roll. Make vent in center of roll and brush
  entire surface and cutouts with egg mixture. Bake at 350 degrees 45
  minutes, or until golden brown. Remove and allow to cool 10 minutes before
  slicing. Serve hot or at room temperature with Cucumber Dill Sauce. Makes
  about 10 servings.

  2 tbs butter 1/4 cup minced shallots 1 1/2 tsp flour 1 cup half and half 1

      Title: Salt Cured Leg of Lamb (Spekemat)
 Categories: Lamb, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 lb Salt                                1 tb Sugar
      4 qt Water (less if the leg is           8 lb Leg of lamb
           -smaller)                      
 
  You will need a large saucepan and a large crock.  Dissolve the salt in the
  water to make a brine.  Add the sugar.  Put the leg of lamb in a large
  crock and pour enough brine over it to cover it completely.  Put a weight
  on top to keep it underwater. Leave to take the salt in a cool pantry (not
  below the freezing point, or the salting process comes to a halt) for 2
  weeks for a leg weighing 8 lbs (roughly 2 days per pound of meat.)
  
  Take the leg out after the allotted time and rinse thoroughly so that you
  do not get too salty a rind.  Hang it out to dry in a well-aired cool
  pantry, wrapped in a loose bag of cheesecloth or muslin to protect it from
  flies.  It will be dry, delicious, and ready to eat in 2 to 3 months.
  
  Serve, sliced very thin with a sharp knife, as part of an indoor picnic
  meal, with sweet butter, fresh hard-boiled eggs, a sliver of 'geitost' (the
  Norwegian sweet brown cheese), and flat bread or potato pancakes to wrap
  around each morsel.  A bowl of sour cream and some fresh raspberries can
  follow as a replacement for Norwegian cloudberries.
  
  Yield:  3 to 5 lbs dried meat.  Allow 1/4 lb of dried meat per person.
  Time:   Start 3 months before you need it; 20 minutes

----------------------------------OPTIONAL----------------------------------
           Salt & White pepper                      Grated nutmeg
 
  To make the sauce, in a heavy saucepan melt the butter and heat WITHOUT
  browning.  Using a wire whisk, stir in the flour.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes
  over low heat, then remove from the burner and gradually stir in the warm
  milk.  Move the pan back to the heat and bring to a boil, stirring steadily
  for a smooth sauce.  Add a pinch of salt and white pepper, and grate a
  little nutmeg for a nice flavor.
      As a general rule, thin white sauce is used for soups and sauces,
  medium for pastitsio and moussaka and other au gratin dishes, and a thick
  sauce for croquettes and souffles. From "The Food of Greece" by Vilma
  Liacouras Chantiles.

      Title: Sausage & Peppers
 Categories: Italian, Pork/ham, Sausages
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Sausage and Peppers            
 
  RE: Crock pot recipes
  
  DC>I am not the most creative person in the world when it comes to using my
  crock pot.  Do any of you have favorite recipes you could post for me?
  
  Here are a couple of things that I make in mine.  I don't have exact
  measurements though, because these are just things I thought up myself.
  
  Brown italian sausage (I usually get about two pounds) in skillet or put
  under
  
  broiler just till browned.  Drain off fat and let cool just till you can
  handle them. Meanwhile they are browning, cup up a whole bunch of onions
  and peppers, and if you want, add a clove of garlic. Place vegees in
  crockpot. Then cut up sausage in very small pieces. Add to crockpot. Cover
  with an eight-ounce can tomato sauce and add oregano, basil or whatever.
  Sook about six or seven hours. Serve in sub rolls or on hamburger burns or
  over rice.
  
  2 Barbecued Beef
  
  Get a very small pot roast.  Season and put in crockpot.  Cover with
  barbecue
  
  sauce.  Add more sauce near the end because the sauce will lose its flavor
  during cooking, or add new sauce after slicing. Remove roast from crockpot
  after cooking, and slice into thin slices. (maybe slices isn't the right
  word,
  
  it kind of shreds.)  Anyway, serve in hamburger buns.  Good with baked
  beans and salad.

 Categories: Soups/stews, German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 tb Flour                                    Broth
      1    Egg                                      Salt

           Soup:                                    Greens
 
  Similar to 'Einlaufsuppe' ('Pour-In Soup').
  
  Combine the first four ingredients in a a small beaker-like pot and stir
  until smooth.  (The batter should drip in a long thin thread off the
  spoon).  Tilt the pot and scrape the batter off the edge into the boiling
  broth.  This results in the elongated 'Schletterle' which are sort of
  halfway between spaetzle and noodles.
  
  Bring to a second boil, and adjust seasoning (salt, nutmeg, pepper, and
  greens).  Serve.
  
  Serves 4.

  You will need a medium-sized stewpan with a lid.  Soak the fruit for a
  couple of hours - or overnight if possible - in either plain water or cold
  tea which will give a darker, richer juice to cover.
  
  Fry the chops in the fat, turning them once, so they take color.  Add the
  fruit and the soaking liquid.  Cover and simmer all together for 30 to 35
  minutes, or until the fruit is soft and the chops cooked through.
  
  Serve with potato dumplings.
  
  Serves 4. Time: Start the day before; 10 minutes plus 35 minutes cooking.

      Title: Schnecken
 Categories: German
      Yield: 12 servings
 
           Cottagecheese\oil pastry            1 pk Vanillin sugar
           For brushing                    1 3/4 oz (50g) currants (washed and
      1 oz (30g) soft butter or marg.               Well drained)
  2 1/2 oz (70g)raisins (washed and                 Finely chopped)
           Well drained)                            Icing:
  1 3/4 oz (50g) almonds (blanched             6 oz (170g) icing sugar
           Filling:                            2 tb Hot water (approx)
      2 tb Heaping of sugar               
 
  roll out the pastry to a rectangle 14x18in. (45x35cm) and brush with the
  fat. For the Filling: mix together the filling ingrediants and distribute
  evenly over the pastry. Starting from the shorter side, roll up like a
  swiss roll. Then use a sharp knofe to cut off slices about 1 1/4 in thick.
  Lay these on a greased baking sheet and flatten slightly. OVEN: preheat
  overn for 5 min at very hot (400) BAKING TIME: 15-20 minutes. For the
  icing: sieve the icing sugar (powdered sugar) and blend with as much of the
  water as will five a good coating consistency. Ice the schnecken while
  still hot.
  
  *I know of no substitute for the vanillin sugar, you might want to check
  gourmet shops or specialty shops. or possibly a custard mix might work.

      Title: Schneiderflecklesuppe
 Categories: Soups/stews, Pasta, German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Egg                                      Meat broth
      1 tb Water                                    Ground nutmeg
           Salt                                     Chives
    200 g  Flour (1 3/4 cups)             
 
  On a pastry board, combine the flour, egg, water and salt into a pasta
  dough, then roll it out paper thin.  Hang the dough over the back of a
  chair or something similar for drying.  After the dough has been drying for
  1 1/2 to 2 hours, cut it into 2/3-inch squares.  As you spread out the
  dough on the board, you will have to keep dusting it with flour.  Bring
  some lightly salted water to a boil and cook the 'Fleckle' for about 10 to
  15 minutes. Drain, briefly rinse in cold water, and then add to the hot
  meat broth.  Adjust soup's seasoning, and top with chopped chives.
  
  Variation:  RIEBELESUPPE
  
  Prepare a dough as for the 'Schneiderflecklesuppe', but make it a bit
  firmer so you will be able to grate it onto the board. Cook 'Riebele' for a
  few minutes in salted water, then strain and add to hot meat broth.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: Schwaemme (Mushrooms)
 Categories: German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 kg Mushrooms (king boletes             2 tb To 3 tb flour
           -and/or chanterelles)                    Salt and pepper to taste
           (a generous 2 lbs)                1/8 l  Cream (1/2 cup plus 1/2
    100 g  Butter (7 Tbsp)                          -Tbsp)
    1/2 l  Water or beef broth (2 cups         2 bn Parsley
           -plus 2 Tbsp)                  
 
  In Swabia this refers only to king boletes with their yellow- green
  underneath side, who do not discolor when cut into, and to the yellow,
  firm-stemmed chanterelle.
  
  a few drops lemon juice
  
  Clean the mushrooms.  On larger king boletes, remove the greenish
  underneath side of the cap.  Cut large mushrooms into 1/6-inch thick
  slices.  In a wide saucepan, melt the butter, then add mushrooms and water
  or broth.  The mushrooms will be tender shortly after the liquid reaches a
  rolling boil.  Stir in the flour paste, and briefly bring to a boil again.
  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the cream and chopped parsley, and season to
  taste.  Serve with potato dumplings or bread dumplings.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: Schweineschnitzel
 Categories: Pork/ham, German
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4    (6-ounce) pork cutlets              1 ts Water
           Salt and freshly ground             1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
           -pepper to taste                    4 tb Butter or margarine
           Flour for dredging                  1 tb Capers
      1    Egg                                      Lemon wedges
 
  Pound the cutlets until thin.  Sprinkle lightly on both sides with salt and
  pepper.  Dredge them lightly but thoroughly in flour.
  
  Beat the egg lightly with the water and dip the floured cutlets in the
  mixture; coat with crumbs.  Using the side of a kitchen knife, tap the
  cutlets lightly so the crumbs will adhere well to the meat.  Transfer them
  to a wire rack.  Refrigerate for one or two hours.  This will help the
  breading adhere to the cutlets when they are being cooked.
  
  Heat the butter in a large skillet and, when it is hot but not brown or
  smoking, saute the cutlets in it until they are golden brown on both sides.
  
  Arrange the cutlets on a heated serving platter and garnish with the capers
  and lemon wedges.  Serve immediately.
  
  Serves four.

      Title: Scottish Eggs
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Sausage meat                        1 ts Cumin
      7    Eggs                                1 ts Water
      2 tb Finely chopped or grated                 Flour for coating purposes
           -onion                                   Fine, dry breadcrumbs
      1 ts Poultry seasoning or sage         1/2    Dz Kokanee beer
 
  First, you shoot a bear and have part of the meat made into sausage.  If
  you're one of those unfortunates who doesn't hunt, I suppose you'd use pork
  sausage meat instead.
  
  To begin, crack a Kokanee, pour it into a frosted mug and quaff it while
  six of the eggs are hard boiling.  When they're done, put them to one side
  and mix the meat, onion, and spice mixture together.  Take the resulting
  mixture and coat the eggs with it carefully and evenly.  You might even
  want to peel the shells off first - although they do add an interesting
  texture.
  
  When the eggs are done, roll them in the flour, shake off the excess, and
  put the eggs in the fridge for about an hour so the meat sets up. While
  you're waiting, you might as well crack another Kokanee and put your feet
  up; no sense straining yourself.
  
  A couple of minutes before the hours up, lightly beat the remaining egg
  with the tsp. of water.  Again, you might want to remove the shell... Take
  the eggs, dip them in the egg mixture, and roll them in the breadcrumbs;
  they are now ready for cooking.
  
  Traditionally, Scotch Eggs are deep fried.  You can do that if you wish,
  but who needs all the extra grease in their diet and the mess and smell? I
  suggest you bake them in the oven at 375 F. for about 20 minutes or until
  the sausage covering is firm when picked at with a knife or fork. I usually
  stick them on a wire rack with a pan underneath so that they don't sit and
  cook in any grease that renders out of the sausage.
  
  Once done take a buddy, yourself, the Scotch Eggs, and the remaining
  Kokanee into the living room.  Watch Hockey Night in Canada as the
  Vancouver Canucks beat some godless team from the east while drinking
  Kokanee and munching the Eggs (you that is, not the Canucks) - no life like
  it.
  
  These go well with Lowenserf Hot German mustard or Louisiana Hot Sauce.
  Best way to serve them is with a chilled Spinach and Bacon salad and fresh
  tomatoes.  Enjoy!

      Title: Scottish Rabbit Curry
 Categories: Ethnic, Meats, Hot
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Fresh Rabbit                        1 ts Mushroom-powder
      6 oz Streaky Bacon                            Celery (optional)
      6    Button onions                            Coco-nut (optional)
      4 tb Butter                                   Salt and cayenne to taste
      1 tb Flour                               1 pt Well seasoned stock
      1 tb Curry-powder                   
 
  Choose a fat, fresh rabbit.  (To test it, examine the kidney.)  Cut it into
  at least twelve pieces; brown these in butter, with onions.  When browned,
  if you wish delicate cookery, pour off the butter and add three-quarters of
  a pint of well-seasoned stock, one large spoonful of curry-powder and one
  of flour, six ounces of streaky bacon cut into half inch cubes, and also
  half a dozen button onions.  Season with a teaspoonful of mushroom powder.
  Simmer this slowly for half an hour at least, stirring it.  Add what more
  seasonings you think required, as cayenne, a little turmeric, or some acid.
  Pile up the pieces of rabbit and pour the sauce, which should be thickish
  as in all curry dishes, over them.  Serve with plain boiled rice in a
  separate dish.
  
  Fresh coco-nut is an excellent ingredient in mild curries.  Rasp and stew
  it the whole time; we do not like green vegetables in curries though they
  are sometimes used.  Mushrooms are an enrichment, celery is good, and onion
  is indispensable.

      4 oz Clarified butter                  1/4 ts Cayenne
      1 md Onion                               1 ds Tabasco
      1 pt Lobster stock                            Paprika; to taste
    1/2 pt Heavy cream                         1 sm Lemon wedge
      1 tb Flour (heaping measure)                  Salt and pepper; to taste
      1 ts Tomato paste                   
 
  Bake four vol au vents (puff pastry shells).  Either use homemade mille
  feuille or commercial puff pastry dough and follow instructions.  Vol au
  vent should be oval shaped and about 12 x 8 cm (5" x 3") in size.
  
  Sauce preparation:  Saute finely-chopped onion in 4 ounces clarified
  butter, add tomato paste, flour, and paprika.  Mix well, add stock,
  stirring until smooth.  Simmer on low heat for 15 minutes.  Add heavy
  cream, seasoning to taste.  Add a dash of cayenne, tabasco and the lemon
  wedge (easy on the spices; Nantua sauce should not be spicy hot).  Let
  simmer for five more minutes.  Retrieve lemon.  Blend sauce in high-spped
  blender until smooth and creamy.
  
  Heat saute pan on medium to high heat.  Drop in butter, then add in quick
  succession: first lobster meat, then prawns, sauteeing each until rare,
  then add mushrooms.  Flame with cognac, add the scallops and saute for 2-3
  minutes.  Pour in the Nantua sauce, adding the bay shrimp, and bring to a
  short bowl.  Fill in preheated vol au vents and serve with steamed
  vegetables.
