MMMMM-----------------------FOOD OF TIBET----------------------------
           Info
 
  In their homeland, dishes use "Tsampa", a flour ground from roasted
  barley. Tibetan staples include barley, yak meat, yak milk, and a tea
  flavored with salt, baking soda and yak butter.  Yak meat is similar
  to beef, but not quite.
  
  Typical foods include noodles; goat cheese; a limited variety of
  vegetables such as potatoes, radishes, cabbage, bok choy and
  cauliflower; and some lamb, chicken, eggs and fish. Dinner might be a
  meat broth with noodles. Sweets are rarely eaten, they eat fruit and
  juice instead, or for some, a favorite dessert is sun dried yak
  cheese.
  
  Tibetans use mild seasonings and not too many spices. The Indian
  influence is evident with the use of red and Basmati rice, the flat
  chapati bread, and curried dishes. Noodles and the momos are of
  Chinese origins.

      Title: TIEM SHUEN GEE YOK (SWEET & SOUR PORK)
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Pork fillet
      1 tb Rice Wine
      1 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
      1 sm Carrot
      1 lg Green pepper
      2 sl Canned pineapple
      4    Chinese dried mushrooms
      1 cl Garlic
    1/4 c  White vinegar
    1/2 c  Water
    1/8 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Salt
      5 tb Sugar
      1 ts Dried chili pepper
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Water
           Oil for deep frying
      2 tb Oil
 
  PREPARATION:
  
  Cut pork into 3/4-inch cubes.  Mix the sherry and 1 tablespoon soy
  sauce together, and add to the pork. With your fingers rub the
  mixture into meat. Still using your fingers, roll the cubes in about
  1/2 cup cornstarch until thoroughly dredged but not too thickly
  covered. (The fineness of the end result of this recipe depends on
  the meat's being crisp -- never soggy.) Cut the carrot on the
  diagonal into 1/4-inch slices. Cut the green pepper in half; remove
  seeds and cut into 1-inch squares. Cut the pineapple slices into
  1/2-inch wedges. Wash the Chinese mushrooms and soak in warm water
  for 30 minutes.  Drain, remove stems. Cut into 1/2-inch strips.
  Smash, peel, and mince garlic. Combine garlic, carrots, green pepper,
  pineapple, and mushrooms.  Combine vinegar, 1/2 cup water, black
  pepper, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, salt, sugar, and chili pepper. In a
  cup, mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Heat oil in deep fry pan to 375-degrees.  Cook pork cubes a few at a
  time until very light brown, about 5 minutes. Stir with a chopstick
  occasionally so that the cubes do not touch each other. Drain on
  paper towels, and keep hot in low oven (200-degrees). Repeat this
  process, cooking pork in hot oil until cubes float and are golden
  brown -- 2 to 3 minutes. (This double cooking insures that the meat
  will be crisp.) Heat the water-vinegar mixture in small saucepan. In
  a medium-sized skillet or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of oil at high
  heat.  Add vegetable-pineapple mixture and stir-fry for 4 minutes.
  Add the hot water-vinegar mixture to the vegetables and stir well.
  Add the cornstarch mixture, and cook and stir until thickened, about
  1 minute. Pour sauce over pork cubes and mix.

      1 c  Sugar
      1 tb Grated orange peel

      1 ts Vanilla
  4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
  4 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
    1/4 ts Ground coriander
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon

MMMMM----------------------MARMALADE ICING---------------------------
    3/4 c  Orange marmalade
      1 lb Sugar, powdered
      1 tb Grand Marnier or orange
           Juice
 
  Constructed from baked biscotti dough, the cookie tree is an edible
  centerpiece. Place almonds in a 8 to 9 inch pan. Bake in a 350~ oven,
  shaking often, until golden, about 15 minutes; cool. In a large bowl,
  beat butter, sugar and orange peel until fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a
  time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in vanilla. Combine
  4-1/2 cups flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cloves, coriander,
  nutmeg and nuts; add to butter mixture and stir to blend thoroughly.
  Divide dough into 3 equal pieces.  On a well-floured board, pat each
  piece into an evenly thick triangle that measures 9 inches across
  base, 2 inches across top and 12 inches on each side.  Make edges
  neat by pressing with a ruler. Carefully transfer each triangle with
  wide spatulas to an oiled 12x15 inch baking sheet.  Bake in a 350~
  oven for 15 minutes; triangles can wait for oven space. Remove from
  oven; cut crosswise (NOT diagonally) into slices exactly 5/8 inch
  wide, using a long knife. Tip slices onto a cut side. Bake until
  golden brown, about 20 minutes; turn cookies over once while baking.
  Cool on reacks.  If made ahead, package airtight up until next day or
  freeze. To build the tree, pipe (using a 1/4 inch tip) or spread a
  little frosting on 1 side of each of the longest cookies. Lay
  icing-side down on a flat platter, tips touching, to form a triangle.
  Pip or spread icing down center of each cookie on plate. Stack the 3
  next-longest cookies on the first, inverting position of the triangle
  (looking down from the top, it will look like a Star of David). Build
  tree, using the next-smallest cookie trio for each level and
  cementing with icing. If you like, pipe icing to drip over the edge
  of the cookies.  Decorate top with holly. Let guests lift off cookies
  to eat. If made ahead or to protect from dust, seal in plastic wrap;
  cookies stay fresh up to 4 days, depending on moisture in air.  Kept
  longer, they hold their shape but get stale. Icing: Smoothly mix
  together 3/4 cp orange marmalade, 1 box (1 lb) or 4 cups sifted
  powder and 1 Tablespoon orange-flavor liqueur or orange juice. If
  icing thickens as you work, stir in a little more orange juice.

 Categories: Info, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  Most black tiger shrimp available in this country are raw, shell-on
  tails (the heads are often left on in Asian countries, but removed
  before arriving on our shores). The shrimp are frozen in blocks
  shortly after harvest.
  
  The black color of the shells initially put off many consumers, but
  price, availability and quality soon won them over. Regardless of
  their color, the shrimp still cook to a nice pink.
  
  Occasionally you may find shrimp with paper-thin shells. These are
  simply shrimp that molted shortly before harvest; they are of the
  same quality as others with more sturdy shells. All shrimp are in a
  continuous cycle of molting as they grow, exchanging their snug,
  smaller shells for new thin shells that harden until the next molt.
  Black tiger shrimp grow especially quickly because t hey live in warm
  tropical waters, so they molt quite often.
  
  The shrimp are often sold with classifications of "medium" or "large",
  while their industry sizing is based on a per-pound value. A shrimp
  labeled 21/25 will number between 21 and 25 shrimp to a pound. The
  smaller the number, the larger the shrimp. Most black tiger shrimp
  found in U.S. markets are 16/20 or 21/35, while smaller shrimp are
  sometimes available.
  
  Black tiger shrimp are the most widely distributed and marketed
  shrimp in the world. Harvests occur along coastlines in an eastward
  arc from the southern tip of Africa almost to the Sea of Japan.
  Almost 80 percent of the black tiger shrimp on the market are farmed,
  with the remainder coming from various Asian countries. They are easy
  to farm because they are quite adaptable and thrive on a wide range
  of environments.
  
  Black tiger shrimp are widely available year-round, although the
  supply of farmed shrimp peaks in February and September and prices
  should be somewhat lower then. Generally, the larger the shrimp, the
  higher the price.
  
  Black tiger shrimp have a notably firm-textured meat. This makes them
  especially forgiving and easy to work with. You can cook them whole,
  in the shell, or remove shells before cooking.
  
  Black tiger shrimp, especially those raised in low-salinity water,
  tend to be milder than ocean caught shrimp.
  
  All cooking methods are suitable for shrimp. They should be cooked
  just until they are opaque through the center. Cooking time will
  depend on the cooking method and the size of the shrimp. Overcooked
  shrimp are tough and nearly flavorless; check them after 2 to 3
  minutes to gauge how much time they will need.
  
  There is a surprising amount of  flavor left in the shells and it can
  be captured in a simple shrimp stock. After peeling your shrimp, toss
  the shells in a pan with just enough water to cover. Add fresh herb
  sprigs, sliced onion, bay leaf, sliced carrot, sliced celery or other
  flavorings if you like. Bring the water to a boil and simmer for
  about 10 minutes. Drain the stock and use it in soups, chowders and
  sauces, or freeze to save. You can also freeze the shells, and simmer
  then at a later date.
  
  Shrimp are a lean, low-fat selection, although (for seafood) they are
  relatively high in cholesterol. A 3« ounce serving has 91 calories, 2
  gm of total fat, 150 mg cholesterol, 18 gm of protein, 148 mg of
  sodium and .5 gm omega-3 fatty acids.

           -1/2" slices
      2 c  Light marinara sauce
      6 ea Beaten eggs
 
  Preparation:
  
  1. Oil the pan or wash-basin generously with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive
  oil so that the phyllo dough will not stick. Line the pan with phyllo
  dough, leaving at least 6" overlay to drape the timpano.
  
  2. Layer the filling as you would with lasagne, but press down with
  your hands so the timpano will hold and it will be well defined.
  
  3. Add lightly sauced penne about 2" or so. Add various grilled
  vegetables in a single layer.
  
  4. Sprinkle with Parmesan and drizzle about 3/4 cup of marinara sauce
  over the first layer.
  
  5. Add 1/2 of the hard-boiled eggs, cut-side down.
  
  6. Repeat layers until pan is filled.
  
  7. Add beaten eggs which will set the timpano. Fold overlay over
  bottom of timpano.
  
  8. Bake on middle rack of 350 degree oven for 1 1 1/2 hours until
  crust is golden. Check timpano after 45 minutes. If the top layer is
  cooking too rapidly, lightly cover with foil.
  
  9. The recipe may be altered with the ingredients of your choice.

 Categories: New zealand, Toheroa, Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Tin Toheroas
      1 pt Milk
      1 pt Cream
 
  Toheroas are considered New Zealand's greatest delicacy. Their flavor
  is quite unique. This shellfish is like a very large cockle. It
  burrows into the sand and is only to be found on certain beaches and
  the season in which it can be gathered is strictly limited as is the
  catch which can be taken on any one day. When the toheroa gathering
  season is on, New Zealanders in their thousands flock to these
  beaches to dig by hand or wooden implement (metal ones are not
  permitted) for these succulent molluscs. Since a visit to New Zealand
  is necessary adjunct to getting fresh toheroas here is a recipe which
  uses the tinned variety for those who cannot visit "the land of the
  long white cloud".
  
  Some fish heads
  
  1. Boil the fish heads in water for 15-20 minutes with salt and pepper
  added to taste.
  
  2. Strain and add minced toheroas from can to the stock and a little
  grated onion.
  
  3. Simmer gently for 15 minutes and add milk.
  
  4. Thicken with a little flour and water paste.
  
  5. Whip the cream and add just before serving. Serves 4

 Categories: Information, Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------PATTI - VDRJ67A---------------------------

MMMMM------------------------COOKIE HINTS-----------------------------
 
  BAKING COOKIES: 1). Bake only one baking sheet at a time in oven for
  best results. If cookies brown unevenly, rotate the baking sheet from
  front to back halfway through baking. If you do use more than one
  baking sheet at a time, switch them halfway through baking. Space
  oven racks 6" apart.
   2). Make sure baking sheets do not touch sides or back of oven.
   3). Allow baking sheets to cool between batches. Dough will spread
  on warm baking sheets.
   4). For bar cookies, rack should be in center of oven.
   5). Watch cookies carefully to avoid overbaking. Check them at the
  minimum baking time, then often to make sure they do not overbake. It
  is generally better to underbake than overbake.
   6). Most cookies should be removed from baking sheets as soon as
  they come from the oven. Use a wide spatula to keep them from
  breaking.
   7). Cool bar cookies in pan on wire rack.
   8). Most cookies should be removed from cookie sheets immediately
  after baking. Cool on waxed paper or paper towels. Only use wire
  racks to cool cookies that are firm. If cookies stick to pan before
  you can remove them, return to oven for a few seconds to warm them
  for easier removal.

      Title: TIPS FOR MAKING THE PERFECT BUTTERMILK BISCUI
 Categories: Breakfast, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Good recipe for biscuits
      1    Light touch with dough
 
  THE PERFECT BUTTERMILK BISCUIT Thanks to Eula Mae Dore, a great
  Southern cook from Avery Plantation, La., I've learned to make the
  best Buttermilk Biscuits I've ever had. Eula Mae says a good biscuit
  is one of the best things to have on hand for quick meals. She uses
  them in emergencies to make simple sandwiches filled with scraps of
  ham or cheese and serves them with pickles and a small salad. For
  dessert, she warms a biscuit or two and makes a shortcake with fresh
  fruits or berries. She has convinced me that you can't have too many
  biscuits on hand. Eula Mae learned to cook and bake from her
  grandmother, not from cookbooks, and the artfulness of her
  preparation was a joy to watch. Here are some of her biscuit-making
  tips: + First go out and replace your baking powder, unless you
  bought it within the last four months. More baking flops occur from
  old, tired baking powder than from any other cause. And don't rely on
  the old test of checking the freshness of baking powder by putting a
  spoonful in a glass of water to see if it fizzes. Baking powder, like
  a carbonated drink, can fizz a little and still be almost flat.
  Buying new baking powder costs very little when you consider the cost
  of baking failures. + Next, Eula Mae insists that sifting the dry
  ingredients four times is the reason her biscuits are perfect. I
  tested the recipe sifting and not sifting and, indeed, sifting does
  make a slightly higher, more tender biscuit. + After you cut the
  biscuit dough, put the pieces on a baking sheet upside down. This
  ensures a taller, lighter biscuit by making sure any edges crimped by
  the pressure of the cutting don't interfere with the rise. (The
  French use the same trick when making puff pastry.) + The tip that
  helped me the most was using less flour than usual. Eula Mae's dough
  was soft and sticky. She handled it gently, dusting her hands and the
  dough with only enough flour to make the dough manageable. The result
  was a lighter biscuit.

 Categories: Breads, Misc
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Recipe hint
 
  1. Choose a quick rising dry yeast. This will speed up the dough
  making
    process. 2. Make sure yeast is fresh. Store in a cool dry place. 3.
  Start with all ingredients at room temperature. Cold ingredients will
    make rising time very long. 4. Heat milk or water only to proper
  temperature (110-115 deg f if
    dissolving dry yeast in liquid, or 120-130 deg f if mixing dry
  yeast with
    flour). 5. Follow one of the mixing methods (premix yeast with
  liquid, 1/4 cup
    liquid for each 1/4 oz. pkg yeast) or (mix dry yeast with flour and
  mix
    with liquid). 6. Always check temperature of liquid with
  thermometer, bakers who guess
    often play it safe and use liquid that is too cool. 7. Choose a warm
  place to let yeast products rise. Cover dough and let
    rise in oven. (warm oven first by turning it on to lowest
  temperature for
    one minute. Turn off and place covered dough in warm oven).

      5 ea Tips for perfect biscuits
 
     Use your fingertips to knead dough.
  
     Don't overwork dough.
  
     Use shortening or butter for best texture.
  
     Make certain baking powder is fresh.
  
     Don't rush baking: Allow biscuits to brown nicely.
  
     Contrary to popular belief, brush biscuits with melted butter AFTER
  baking--not before.
  
     Hint:  To save on calories and fat, spray tops of biscuits with
  food release spray instead of brushing with butter--no one will ever
  know the difference!! (Except the scales).

      Title: TIPS FOR PERFECT ROAST CHICKEN
 Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Here are several techniques that help to add flavor to roast chicken.
  
  Before roasting, lift the skin of the breast and leg sections by
  sliding your fingers under it, then seasoning the meat underneath.
  This accomplishes several things. First. it puts the flavorings
  directly on the meat where they will do the most good. Second, for
  diners who remove the skin before eating, this ensures that the
  seasoning will not be stripped away with the skin.  Finally, it gives
  easily scorched ingredients, such as fresh herbs or minced garlic,
  protection from the drying heat of the oven. In addition to
  seasonings, rub a bit of oil under and over the skin. This helps to
  flavor and moisten the meat, and insures that the skin will crisp
  well during roasting.
  
  Start roasting chickens breast-side down in a hot oven (at least
  400F). This crisps the back and gives the thickest part of the thighs
  a head start in cooking. Then after 30 minutes or so, reduce the oven
  temperature, turn the chicken over, and stuff, baste or sauce it, the
  continue roasting until done. The roasting times may seem a bit long
  by recent cookbook standards.
  
  Of course. doneness is a personal choice, but I don't want to ever
  carve into a chicken with a rosy pink breast and jiggling thighs. I
  prefer chickens roasted to between 170F and 175F. At this
  temperature, the breast may be a bit dry (white meat begins to lose
  moisture after 165F), but the dark meat will be cooked through.

MMMMM------------------------COOKIE HINTS-----------------------------
 
  PREPARING COOKIES: 1). Read the entire recipe before beginning to
  make sure you have everything needed.
   2). Measure all ingredients accurately and assemble in order given in
  recipe.
   3). Prepare pans according to recipe directions. Use only solid
  shortening or margarine for greasing pans.
   4). Cookie sheets with little or no sides will allow cookies to bake
  quickly and evenly. Aluminum or teflon coated pans give the best
  results. Dark metal pans cause cookies to have an undesirable dark
  crust.
   5). Adjust racks and preheat oven about 10 minutes before you begin
  baking cookies.
   6). Easy does it when adding flavorings and colorings to cookie
  dough. Pour mixtures into measuring spoon away from batter in bowl so
  if excess spills out it will not ruin the dough.
   7). Use standard measuring cups for all dry ingredients. Use glass or
  plastic liquid measuring cups with pouring spout to measure liquid
  ingredients. Place the cup on a flat surface, fill to desired mark and
  check at eye level.
   8). Use standard measuring spoonsto measure, not eating or serving
  spoons. For dry ingredients, fill spoons to overflowing and level off
  with straight edge of metal spatula or knife.
   9). Lightly spoon flour into correct measuring cup and then level it
  off. Do not tap or bang the cup nor dip it into the flour. This will
  pack the flour, giving more than needed. Too much flour will make dry
  cookies.

   10). Drop Cookies: Cookies uniform in size will finish baking at same
  time. Use ice cream scoop with release bar to easily shape drop
  cookies. a #80 or #90 scoop yields about 1 teaspoonful of dough. Make
  sure cookies are spaced apart as directed in recipe so as not to
  crowd cookies.
   11). Rolled cookies: Doughs are usually easier to shape and roll
  after a period of refrigeration. Remove only enough dough from
  refrigerator to work with at one time.
  
   12). Bar cookies: always use the pan size called for. Substituting a
  different size pan will affect texture of cookie.
   13). Refrigerator cookies: For firm and smoothly shaped rolls, wrap
  rolls securely in waxed paper to chill before slicing. Unwrap and
  slice evenly with a thin, sharp knife. Use gentle back and forth
  motion when slicing so they keep their shape. Rotating the roll while
  slicing also prevents one side from flattening.

MMMMM----------------------PATTI - VDRJ67A---------------------------

MMMMM------------------------COOKIE HINTS-----------------------------
 
  STORING AND FREEZING COOKIES: 1). Separate soft and crisp textured
  cookies for storage. Soft cookies should be kept in tightly covered
  containers. Crisp cookies may be stored in a cookie jar or container
  with loose fitting lid in a dry climate. In humid climate, store
  crisp cookies in a tightly covered container.
   2). If soft cookies begin to dry out, add a piece of apple or bread
  to the container to help them retain moisture. If crisp cookies
  become soggy and are not decorated, heat in a 300~ oven for 3-5
  minutes to crisp them.
   3). Store frosted cookies and thumb print cookies in a single layer
  in a tightly covered container. If need be for space, layer cookies
  between waxed paper to protect.
   4). Bar cookies may be stored, tightly covered, in baking pan. Some
  may require refrigeration because of ingredients in them.
   5). Unbaked cookie dough can be refrigerated for up to one week or
  frozen for up to 6 weeks. Rolls of dough should be sealed tightly in
  plastic wrap; other doughs should be stored in airtight containers.
   6). Crisp cookies freeze better than soft cookies. Bars and brownies
  are an exception to this rule since they freeze extremely well.
  
   7). Freeze unfrosted cookies from 9-12 months. Separate layers with
  waxed paper or plastic wrap.
   8). Freeze frosted cookies uncovered until they are firm. Then pack
  them in airtight container lined with plastic wrap or foil. They can
  be frozen for 2-3 months.
   9). Cardboard containers are not recommended for storage as the
  flavor and aroma from the box may be absorbed by the cookies.
   10). Frozen cookies thaw in about 10 minutes at room temperature.

      Title: TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL GRILLING
 Categories: Information, Grill/bbq, Meats
      Yield: 1 Text
 
           - Grilling Tips -
 
  Basic Grilling Tips:
  
  Grilling time can vary with the cut of beef, grid position,
  temperature of coals, weather and desired doneness.
  
  Our recipes start with beef taken directly from the refrigerator. It
  is not a safe food practice to bring meat to room temperature before
  cooking
  
  Use medium to medium-low coals to ensure even cooking.
  
  Trim excess fat from meats to avoid flare-ups while grilling.
  
  Direct grilling can be done with the grill covered or open; foods
  cooked in a covered grill usually cook faster.
  
  Use long-handled tongs for turning steaks or roasts; spatulas for
  turning burgers. Don not use a fork, which pierces the beef, allowing
  flavorful juices to escape.
  
  Determine the doneness of steaks by making a small slit near the bone
  and checking the color; for boneless cuts make a slit near the
  center. For thicker steaks, use a quick-recovery meat thermometer to
  accruately gauge the doneness.
  
  Grilling with Mesquite & Hickory for Great Flavor:
  
  Mesquite and Hickory are great for grilling. They're easy to light and
  you're grilling in 20 minutes. Wood can be used with any type grill.
  You'll enjoy the outdoor Texas flavor it gives you meals! Mesquite
  wood provides a sweet, delicate taste that accents beef. Hickory wood
  imparts a smoky, bacon-like flavor often associated with
  Southern-style cooking.
  
  Direct Grilling Method:
  
  Foods are cooked directly over coals. This is a fast method for
  cooking steaks and burgers.  Mesquite wood burns hot, so cook around
  perimeter of coals
  
  Indirect Grilling Method:
  
  Slow cook thicker steaks and roasts in a covered grill. Bank coals
  around a foil pan. Place beef over pan so food is not over coals.
  Keep grill temperature at 300 degrees to roast. Add wood to maintain
  heat.
  
  Flavoring with Wood Chips:
  
  Wrap a handful of wood chips in a foil pouch. Pierce the foil to
  release smoke. Put pouch over hot charcoal or gas briquettes. The
  chips will smolder and not flame.
  
  Cooking with Wood Chunks:
  
  Stack wood over 2 sheets of crumpled newspaper or starter stick. Open
  vents. Light paper; let wood burn 15-20 minutes. Extinguish flame by
  closing lid and vents for 30 seconds. Adjust vents for desired heat
  level. Begin grilling. Note; Hickory is a dense wood and may require
  more paper or lighter fluid to start fire. Or, use convenient
  Light-the-bag chunks. The wood is pre-measured for one cookout. Place
  entire bag in grill and light corners.
  
  To test temperature of coals:
  
  Hold your palm over grill at cooking height. If the heat forces you
  to pull away in 3 seconds, coals are hot; if 4 seconds, coals are
  medium and it 5 seconds, coals are low.
  
  To lower temperature of coals;
  
  Raise grid or spread out the coals. If cooker is covered, close vents
  halfway
  
  To raise temperature of coals;
  
  Lower grid or push together coals. Add more chunks to outer edge of
  hot coals. If cooker is covered, open vents fully.
  
  Checking Beef's Doneness:
  
  Use a quick-read meat thermometer. Or, you can also use the touch
  method. If the meat is rare, it will feel soft and yielding; if
  medium it will give slightly; and if well-done it will be firm

      Yield: 1 Serving
 
MMMMM--------------------DIRECTIONS CONTINUE-------------------------
 
  Heat the heavy cream and half-and-half in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan over
  medium-high heat. When hot, add 1/2 cup sugar. Stir to dissolve and
  bring the mixture to a boil, about 10 to 12 minutes.
  
  While the cream is heating, place the egg yolks and the remaining 1/4
  cup sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat
  the yolks on high for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, then scrape down the sides
  of the bowl. Beat on high, until slightly thickened and
  lemon-colored, and additional 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. (At this point, the
  cream should be boiling. If not, adjust mixer speed to low and
  continue to mix until the cream boils. If this is not done, the egg
  yolks will develop undesirable lumps.) Pour the boiling cream into
  the beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine. Return to the saucepan and
  heat over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the cream
  reaches a temperature of 185 degrees, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the rum and
  combine thoroughly. Remove from the heat and transfer to a stainless
  steel bowl. Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath to a temperature of
  40 to 45 degrees, about 20 minutes. When the mixture is cold, freeze
  in an ice-cream freezer following the manufacturer's instructions.
  Transfer the semifrozen ice cream to the plastic container that is
  holding the chocolate pecan crunch. Stir with a rubber spatula to
  thoroughly combine the crunch with the semifrozen ic cream. Securely
  cover the container, then place in the freezer several hours before
  serving. Serve within 3 days.

           -JUDI M. PHELPS

MMMMM-----------------------CUSTARD SAUCE----------------------------
      4    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Milk; scalded
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Heavy cream; whipped

MMMMM-------------------------TIPSY LADY------------------------------
      1    Sponge cake; 8 or 9"
           -diameter
           Or pound cake
    1/3 c  Cream sherry
    1/3 c  Brandy
    2/3 c  Raspberry or strawberry jam
      1 c  Heavy cream; whipped
    1/3 c  Slivered almonds; toasted
 
  Whip the egg yolks and sugar in the top of a cold double boiler. Pour
  in the scalded milk, whisking all the while. Set the pot over boiling
  water and continue stirring until the custard starts to thicken and
  will coat a spoon smoothly.  It will fluff up and resemble
  hollandaise sauce. Stir in the vanilla and pour the custard into a
  mixing bowl. Chill in the refrigerator.  When cold, whisk lightly to
  soften, fold in the whipped cream, and set aside.
  
  Split the cake into 3 layers and sprinkle them with sherry and brandy.
  Spread 2 layers with jam.  Place one of these layers in a clear glass
  serving bowl barely large enough to hold the whole dessert, and
  sprinkle it with more sherry and brandy, followed by half of the
  Bavarian cream. Stack the second jam-covered layer on top and repeat
  the procedure, using up the remaining sherry, brandy, and Bavarian
  cream. Place the third layer on top and cover with whipped cream.
  Sprinkle with the toasted almonds. Refrigerate for at least 1 to 2
  hours before serving so that the flavors blend and the cake moistens
  properly.

      8 oz Ladyfingers (60 ladyfingers)
      4 tb Brandy
      1 tb Instant coffee (preferably
           -espresso) granules
      3    Large egg whites
      1 c  Plus 2 T sugar
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
      4 oz Mascarpone cheese (1/2 C)
      4 oz Reduced-fat cream cheese
           -(1/2 c), softened
           Chocolate shavings &
           Confectioners' sugar for
           Garnish
 
  If ladyfingers are soft, toast them in a 350 degree F oven for 6 to 8
  minutes.
  
  In a small bowl, stir together 3 T of the brandy, coffee granules and
  1 cup water.  Brush over the flat side of the ladyfingers. Set aside.
  
  Bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer in the bottom of a large
  saucepan. Combine egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and 3 T cold
  water in a heatproof mixing bowl that will fit over the saucepan. Set
  the bowl over the simmering water and beat with a hand-held mixer at
  low speed until an instant-read or candy thermometer registers 140
  degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes. Increase speed to high and continue
  beating over heat for 3 minutes (The mixture should form a ribbon
  trail.) Remove the bowl from the heat and beat until cool and fluffy,
  about 4 minutes. Set aside.
  
  In a large bowl, beat mascarpone and cream cheese until creamy. Add
  about 1 cup of the beaten whites and the remaining 1 T brandy and
  beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Fold in the
  remaining whites.
  
  Line the bottom and sides of a 3 quart trifle bowl or souffle dish
  with ladyfingers.  Spoon in one-quarter of the filling and tip with a
  layer of ladyfingers. Repeat with two more layers of filling and
  ladyfinters, arranging the fourth layer of ladyfingers decoratively
  over the top, trimming to fit, if necessary. Top with the remaining
  filling. Garnish with chocolate shavings.  Cover and chill for at
  least 8 hours or overnight. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    10-12" Sponge Cake 3" Tall
      3 oz Strong Black Coffee Or:
           Prepared Instant Espresso
      3 oz Brandy, Rum Or Your Favorite
           -Liqueur
  1 1/2 lb Cream Cheese Or: Mascarpone*
  1 1/2 c  Superfine Or Powdered Sugar
           Cocoa Powder, Unsweetened
 
  *  Cream cheese or mascarpone should be at room temperature.
  Mascarpone is available at some Italian specialty food stores and
  some gourmet food stores.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Cut across the middle of the sponge cake to form
  two disks, about 1"-1-1/2" thick, each. Blend the coffee or espresso
  and liqueur together.
   Sprinkle the bottom half of the cake with the coffee liqueur blend,
  enough to flavor it strongly, but don't saturate the cake so much
  that it will collapse.  Mix the cream cheese or mascarpone with the
  sugar and beat the cheese until the sugar is completely dissolved and
  the cheese is light and spreadable.  Spread the bottom half off the
  cake with half of the creamy cheese, in a fairly thick layer. Set the
  second half of the cake on the bottom half and repeat the process -
  sprinkle the coffee/liqueur blend and spread with the remaining cream
  cheese. Put the cocoa powder into a wire strainer and coat the top
  layer of cream cheese completely with cocoa. Refrigerate the cake for
  at least two hours before cutting and serving.

  The authentic tiramisu (pick me up) calls for marscapone cheese,
  which is relatively hard to get and expensive. I have found the
  following substitute works well.  Be sure you use firm or stale lady
  fingers so it doesn't get mushy. From: Fred Towner Date: 08-03-93

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Egg yolks
      3 tb Superfine sugar

    1/4 c  Very strong espresso
           -coffee

           -temperature
    1/2 c  Cream
      1    Egg white
      4 oz Ladyfingers
 
  Tiramisu("pick me up") is a modern version of a dessert first created
  in Siena, where it was called zuppa del Duca (the Duke's soup!). From
  there it migrated to Florence, where it became very popular in the
  nine- teenth century among the many English people who came to live
  in the city at that time. And so it was called zuppa inglese--English
  soup. Only recently, the same dessert with some variation--chiefly
  the substitution of rich mascarpone cheese for the original
  custard--has come to be called tiramisu.
  
  Make a zablione by beating the egg yolks and sugar in the top of a
  double boiler until ivory colored.  Add 1/3 cup liquor and whisk over
  gently simmering water until the mixture begins to thicken. Let cool.
  
  Stir the coffee into the mascarpone. Whip the cream to soft peaks.
  Beat the egg white until stiff.  Fold the egg white into the
  zabaglione. Dip the lady fingers into the remaining liquor and
  arrange in a single layer in the bottom of a 9 in. bowl. Cover them
  with half the mascarpone, then half the zabaglione and half the
  cream. Repeat the layers, finishing with the cream. Refrigerate for
  several hours before serving. From: Fred Towner Date: 08-03-93

     16 oz Cream cheese (2 8 oz.
           -packages)
    1/3 c  Sour cream
      2    Ounces (1/4 cup) whipping
           -cream
 
  Arrange half the lady fingers in the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan. Mix hot
  water with coffee granules and 2 T. brandy. Pour 1/2 this mixture
  gently over lady fingers. Set aside.
  
  Make a zablione by beating the egg yolks and sugar in the top of a
  double boiler until ivory colored.  Add 1/4 C. brandy and whisk over
  simmering water until the mixture starts to thicken - 8-10 minutes.
  Let cool a little. Stir constantly while cooking.
  
  Carefully mix zabliogne with mascarpone cheese.  It will appear to be
  quite liquid. Whip the egg whites until very stiff and fold into
  zabliogne/mascarpone mixture.
  
  Pour 1/2 zabliogne mixture over the lady fingers, which have been
  soaking up the coffee/brandy mixture. Top with 1/2 whipped cream.
  Sprinkle with 1/2 of cocoa powder and 1/2 of grated chocolate.
  
  Place balance of lady fingers on top of this to create a second
  layer. Pour remaining coffee mixture carefully over these lady
  fingers. Then repeat layers; zabliogne, whipped cream, cocoa powder
  and grated chocolate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate till
  set. It is best if left over-night. When ready to serve, decorate
  with piped-on whipped cream around the edges and more chocolate
  and/or cocoa powder if desired. Yield 10-12 servings, depending on
  the size you cut them. It is quite rich so you might consider smaller
  sized pieces.
  
  NOTE:  You can substitute Marsala wine for the brandy if you prefer
  and like the taste of Marsala.
  
  MASCARPONE CHEESE SUBSTITUTE Mascarpone cheese is sold in Italian
  delis, cheese  shops and speciality food markets. It is somewhat
  difficult to find and very expensive (i.e. from $9.95 per pound).
  From January 1991 Southern Living Magazine comes this substitute for
  mascarpone.
  
  Blend three ingredients well, until it becomes somewhat light and
  fluffy. This will make the equivalent of about 2 1/2 cups of cheese.
  Substitute in equal amounts - 1 cup substitute for 1 cup mascarpone.

  Hi Scott, hi Stacy!  Know you love desserts, so I thought I'd share
  this fabulous recipe from Bon Appetit with you. Granted, it is a bit
  time-consuming, but should keep you busy - and...it is so worth the
  wait. Whisk yolks, 6 tablespoons sugar, and Marsala in large metal
  bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not
  allow water to touch bottom of bowl). Using portable electric mixer
  beat until mixture triples in volume about 5 minutes. Cover
  zabaglione and refrigerate until well chilled.  (Can be prepared 2
  days ahead). Place mascarpone in large bowl. Using electric mixer
  whip cream with 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to soft peaks.
  Fold into mascarpone. Gently fold in zabaglione. Refrigerate until
  well chilled about 3 hours. Combine espresso coffee, rum, 3
  tablespoons sugar, and vanilla in small bowl. Brush over both sides
  of cake pieces. Place generous tablespoon mascarpone mixture in
  bottom of each of 8 balloon-shaped wineglasses. Set cake square or
  wedge into each at angle. Top with remaining mascarpone mixture.
  Combine shaved chocolate and ground coffee

  Put the eggwhites in a bowl of an electric mixer and put the bowl in a
  second bowl of hot water and let the whites stand, stirring
  occasionally, for 15 minutes.
  
  Add the cream of tartar and salt and bet the whites until they just
  hold stiff peaks. While the whites are being beaten, in a saucepan
  combine the sugar and 1/4 cup of water. Bring the mixture to a boil,
  stirring to dissolve the sugar, and boil the syrup until it registers
  240 deg. on a candy thermometer.  Add the sugar syrup to the whites
  in a stream, slowly,while beating and beat the mixture until it is
  cool. Add the mascarpone, rum and chocolate and beat until well
  combined. Divide the cookie or cake crumbs among 4 stemmed glasses.
  Drizzle each portion with 2 tablespoons of the coffee and top the
  crumbs with half the mascarpone mixture.  Layer the remaining cookie
  crumbs, coffee and mascarpone mixture in the same manner. Chill the
  parfaits, covered for a minimum of
        2    hours, or overnight.
  
  Garnish:  In a metal bowl, set over a pan of barely simmering water,
  melt the chocolate.  Line a baking sheet with foil and spread the
  chocolate about 1/8" thick on the foil. Chill the chocolate triangles
  on the baking sheet until it is just set, but not hard, and with a
  pastry wheel, cut it into triangles.  Chill the chocolate triangles
  on the baking sheet until they have hardened and peel the foil
  carefully from them. Garnish each parfait with a chocolate triangle.

  COMPLETE GUIDE TO HOME CANNING
  
  Caution: To prevent the risk of botulism, low-acid and tomato foods
  not canned according to the recommendations in this publication or
  according to other USDA-endorsed recommendations should be boiled
  even if you detect no signs of spoilage.  At altitudes below 1,000
  feet, boil foods for 10 minutes.  Add an additional minute of boiling
  time for each additional 1,000 ft. elevation.
  
  Reference to commercial products and services is made with the
  understanding that no discrimination is intended and no endorsement
  by the U.S. Department of Agriculture is implied. Clear Jel
  (registered trademark) is mentioned because it is the only suitable
  product that is presently available to the general public through
  distributors of speciality products.
  
  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
  
  The creation of an Extension Service Center for Excellence at the Penn
  State University made it possible to conduct the research necessary to
  revise four previously published bulletins for canning foods in the
  home. The Center, no longer in operation, was a cooperative effort of
  the Extension Service, Cooperative State Research Service, and the
  Penn State University with Gerald D. Kuhn, Ph.D., of the Penn State
  University as Director.
  
  The Extension Services wishes to credit the primary development of
  this guide to Gerald D. Kuhn, Elizabeth L. Andress (currently with the
  University of Georgia), and Thomas S. Dimick. Extension staff who
  assisted in preparing this guide include Milton P. Baldauf, Catherine
  E. Adams, Nancy T. Sowers, and Vincent G. Hughes. Extension staff who
  assisted in this revision include Kenneth N. Hall (University of
  Connecticut) and Thomas W. Poore.  All have contributed significant
  ideas and time in making this guide a truly up-to-date research-based
  publication.
  
  PREFACE
  
  Home canning has changed greatly in the 170 years since it was
  introduced as a way to preserve food. Scientists have found ways to
  produce safer, higher quality products. Section 1 of this guide
  explains the scientific principles of on which canning techniques are
  based, discusses canning equipment, and describes the proper use of
  jars and lids. It describes basic canning ingredients and procedures
  and how to use them to achieve safe, high-quality canned products.
  Finally, it helps you decide whether or not and how much to can.
  
  The other six sections of this guide contain a series of factsheets
  for specific foods. These factsheets offer detailed directions for
  making sugar syrups; and for canning fruits and fruit products,
  tomatoes and tomato products, vegetables, red meats, poultry,
  seafoods, and pickles and relishes. Handy guidelines for choosing the
  right quantity and quality of raw food accompany each set of
  directions for fruits, tomatoes and vegetables. Most recipes are
  designed to yield a full canner load of pints or quarts. Finally
  processing adjustments for altitudes above sea level are given for
  each food.
  
  This publication contains many new research-based recommendations for
  canning safer and better food at home.. It is an invaluable resource
  for persons who are canning for the first time. Experienced canners
  will find updated information to help them improve their canning
  practices. =======================================================

      Title: TO CURE HAMS
 Categories: Penndutch, Ham, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    100 lb Ham
      3 oz Salt peter
      1 pt Salt, kosher
    1/2 lb Brown sugar
      1 x  *also:
      2 pt Salt
    1/8 lb Pepper
 
  *** The "recipe" specifies ham from corn-fed hogs, and "fine salt
  (best quality)". Since kosher salt is commonly available today, and
  contains no iodine, I changed the ingredients to specify it. Mix
  thoroughly the salt peter, 1 pint salt and brown sugar and rub over
  the hams and let stand for 24 hours. Then rub the meat with the
  pepper and part of the remaining salt. Let stand for 5 days and then
  rub meat again with fine salt. Set aside for 30 days, hang the meat
  up and brush off the salt. Have hams smoked at a good smoke house,
  smoking them for 10 days with wood. When finished, rub entire ham
  with red pepper, wrap carefully in brown paper and then in muslin
  bags and hang up with the hock down. Hams prepared in this manner
  will keep indefinitely, and flavor and quality improve with time.

  portions. Place meat in a large bowl and rub thoroughly with one
  portion of the above mixture. Let stand 1 day. Follow same procedure
  on second and third days. Turn meat several times a day. Allow meat
  to remain in bowl for 7 more days, then hang in a warm place until
  meat stops dripping. Whe dripping has stopped, hang in a cool shed
  about 6 weeks to dry thoroughly. Wrap meat in clean muslin bags and

      Title: TO MAKE BREAD
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  ================== Information file ==================
  
  I thought you might like to see this recipe reprinted from Domestic
  Cookery from 1864.  It was an English book.
  
  "To make bread let flour be kept four to five weeks before it is
  begun to be used to bake with.  Put half a bushel of good flour into
  a trough or kneading tub; mix with it between four and five quarts of
  warm water and a pint and a half of good hop yeast.  Stir well with
  your hands until it becomes tough.  Let it rise about an hour and a
  half or less if it rises fast; then, before it falls, add four more
  quarts of warm water and half pound of salt.  Work it well and cover
  with a cloth. Put the fire then into the oven and by the time it is
  warm enough the dough will be ready. Make the loaves about five
  pounds each; sweep out the oven very clean and quick, and put in the
  bread; shut it up close and two and one half hours will bake it. In
  summer the water should be milk warm, in winter a little more and in
  frosty weather as hot as you can well bear your hands in but not
  scalding else the whole will be ruined. If baked in tins the crust
  will be very nice.
  
  The oven should be round, not long; the roof twenty to twenty-four
  inches high, the mouth small and the door of iron to shut close. This
  construction will save firing and time and bake better than long and
  high-roofed ovens."

      Title: TO PREPARE SUSHI RICE
 Categories: Japan, Grains/rice
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 1 1/16 c  Cooked rice
      2 tb Vinegar
    1/2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
           For 5 cups sushi rice
      5 c  Cooked rice
 1 9/16 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
   9/16 ts Salt
           For 7.1/2 cups sushi rice
 3 9/16 c  Cooked rice
      5 tb Vinegar
   9/16 tb Sugar
      2 ts Salt
           For 10 cups sushi rice
     10 c  Cooked rice
      7 tb Vinegar
      2 tb Sugar
      3 ts (1 tablespoon) salt
 
  Basic recipe ingredients:
  
  For 2.1/2 cups sushi rice:
  
  Directions:
  
  Prepare a non-metallic tub, preferably a wooden or glass (make sure
  it's not polished since the vinegar will remove the wax polish)
  
  1. Wash the mixing tub well. Dry with kitchen towel
  
  2. Put cooked rice into mixing tub and spread evenly over the bottom
  of mixing tub.
  
  3. Sprinkle vinegar mixture generously over rice. You may not need
  all of vinegar mixture. Do not add too much liquid.
  
  4. With a large wooden spoon, mix rice with a slicing motion.
  
  5. While you mix, use a hand or an electric fan. This is not to cool
  sushi rice, but to puff the extra liquid away.
  
  6. Keep sushi rice in the wooden tub, covered with a damp cloth.

      Title: TO ROAST CHILES
 Categories: Info, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
  Lay whole peppers or chiles directly on the BBQ grill, under a
  broiler or over a gas flame.  Grill or broil, turning frequently,
  until the chiles' skins are evenly blackened and charred all over,
  but flesh is still crisp.
  
  Put the chiles into a paper bag for a few minutes to cool and steam -
  this helps further loosen the skins; rinsing under running water will
  help remove stubborn bits. Rub and peel off the charred skins, then
  slit and remove veins and seeds.  With very hot chiles, wear rubber
  gloves and don't touch your eyes.
  
  Use the prepared chiles in sauces, to make salsa, homemade fajitas
  and all Mexican dishes, in rice casseroles, in omelets, and on
  hamburgers. Also great with summer squash, tomatoes, green beans or
  corn.

  adding oil if necessary to keep them from sticking, for 7 minutes or
  until they are golden brown. Transfer the sausages with a slotted
  spoon to a plate, pour 3 T. of fat from the skillet into an 8" square
  baking pan and heat the pan in a preheated very hot oven (450^) for

  and bake it in the very hot oven for two minutes, or until it is set.
  Arrange the sausages on the batter, pour the remaing batter over
  them, and bake the mixture for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to moderate
  (375^) and bake the mixture for 10-15 minutes more, or until it is
  puffed and golden brown. Serve the dish immediately with Dijon-style

      1    Stalk lemongrass

           -- (more if you like
           -- chewing on them.)
      4    Kaffir lime leaves
           Cilantro leaves as desired
      1 ts Chili sauce
      2 tb Fish sauce
  1 1/2 tb Lemon juice

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
           Sliced hot peppers
           -(2 or 3 slices per serving)
 
  * (ad libbed with about 1 tsp or 1 tblsp of powdered thyme)
  
  ** (Some boneless skinless chicken pieces, plus some thighs with the
  bones bashed once with the back of a knife would be ok too -- the
  point being to get the flavor from the marrow out.)
  
  *** as many as you want, cut any way you want, of any kind you want
  
  Instructions: ============= Use a large covered stockpot. Heat olive
  and sesame oil on high heat. Add cloves, bay leaves, thyme, (these
  should be pounded a bit first to crack the fibers and release more
  flavor) and onion, carrots.  Cover 2 minutes, stir if you want.
  
  Add chicken on top, and pour ONE cup of water over the tops of the
  chicken. Cover.  Cook 5 minutes on high.
  
  Add remainder of water, cover, continue heating till it starts to
  boil, then turn heat down and simmer covered 30 minutes. Skim off foam
  occasionally. Remove chicken, debone, and cut into bite sized pieces.
  Strain soup, avoid getting the sediment at the bottom. (What you do
  with the leftover veggies after making a stock is up to you. I think
  they end up in Minnesotan hot dishes....)
  
  Take 4 cups of the stock, heat until it begins to boil, turn down the
  heat till it is just simmering. Add galanga, lemongrass, Kaffir lime
  leaves (bash them a bit to break the fibers--it allows them to
  release more flavor).  Add mushrooms, chicken, (shrimp if you must).
  Stir in the fish sauce, chili paste.  Cover, cook for another 5
  minutes. Serve.
  
  Add lemon juice (just have slices of lemon or lime that you can
  squeeze) cilantro, and thinly sliced jalepenos or other hot peppers
  at the table. Fresh liquorice basil also adds a nice touch.
  
  Comments/Modifications: ======================= We cheated and used
  Swansons reduced salt chicken stock for the water in the beginning
  because we used boneless skinless chicken. Can't tell if it hurt or
  helped.
  
  Also had 4 shiitake mushrooms which had been soaking for several
  days, so they were cut up, and the soaking juice was added along with
  the chicken and mushrooms. About one cup of this. Big win. Yum.

      1/8 ts salt
      1/4 c  lime juice -- fresh
        2 TB lemon juice -- fresh
        1 lg egg -- lightly beaten
        2 TB butter -- unsalted,
  :          softened
      1/4 c  coconut -- flaked
  :          for the icing
    1 1/2 c  sugar
        2 TB light corn syrup
        3 lg egg white -- room
  :          temperature
      1/2 ts cream of tartar
      3/4 ts vanilla
    1 1/2 c  coconut -- flaked
  :          lime slices for garnish
  
  Make the cake: Line the bottoms of 2 greased 8 by 2 inch round cake
  pans with rounds of wax paper and grease and flour the pans, shaking
  out the excess flour. Spread the coconut in a jelly-roll pan, toast
  it in a preheated 350F oven, stirring once or twice, for 7 minutes,
  or until it is golden and let it cool. In a bowl whisk together the
  flour, the bakingpowder, the salt. In a large bowl with an electric
  mixer cream the shortening, beat in 3/4 cup of the sugar, and beat
  the mixture until it is light and fluffy. Beat in the yolks,one at a
  time, and the vanilla and add the flour mixture alternately with the
  milk, beginning and ending with the flour and beating until the
  batter is smooth. In another largebowl with the electric mixer beat
  the whites with the salt until they are foamy, add the cream of
  tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks. Beat in the
  remaining 1/2 cup sugar, a little at a time, and beat the meringue
  until it holds stiff glossy peaks. Stir! the toasted coconut and one
  fourth of the meringue into the batter to lighten it and fold in the
  remaining meringue gently but thoroughly. Divide the batter between
  the preparedpans and bake the layers in the middle of the preheated
  350F oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until tester comes out clean. Let
  the layers cool in the pans on racks for 10 minutes,invert them onto
  the racks, and let them cool completely.
  
  Make the filling: In a small heavy saucepan whisk together the sugar,
  cornstarch, salt, lime juice, lemon juice, and the egg until the
  mixture is combined and bring the mixture to a rolling boil over
  moderately high heat, whisking constantly. (The mixture will thicken
  as it cooks.) Whisk in the butter and let the filling cool.
  
  Split each cake layer in half horizontally with a long serrated knife
  and brush off any  loose crumbs. On a cake plate arrange one of the
  cake layers, cut side up, and spread it with one third of the lime
  filling, leaving a 1/2 inch border. Sprinkle the filling with 1/4 cup
  of the coconut and top the coconut with another cake layer, cut side
  down. Continueto layer and fill the cake in the same manner with the
  remaining filling and coconut.
  
  Make the icing:  In a saucepan combine the sugar, corn syrup, 1/3 cup
  water, bring the mixture to a boil, covered, over moderate heat,
  stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar,and boil the syrup,
  uncovered until it registers 240F on a candy thermometer. While the
  syrup is boiling, in a heatproof bowl with an electric mixer beat the
  whites with a pinch of salt and the cream of tartar until they are
  frothy. As soon as the syrup reaches 240F. add it to the whites in a
  thin stream, continuing to beat the whites while the syrup is being
  added. Beat in the vanilla and beat the icing until the bowl is not
  longer hot. (If the icing is too stiff, beat in 1 to 2 tablespoons
  hot water, or enough to form a fluffy, spreadable icing.) Spread the
  icing over the side and top of the cake and cover the cake with the
  coconut. Garnish the cake with the lime slices.

      Title: TOBACCO ONIONS
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lg Red onion
      1 lg Yellow Spanish onion
      3 c  Unbleached flour
      1 tb Cayenne pepper
      1 tb Paprika
           Salt & pepper to taste
      5 c  Canola oil for frying
 
  from Chef Dean Fearing at The Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas,
  Texas. These onion rings have a decidedly Southwestern taste and a
  browned, shrivelly appearance that led him to call them 'tobacco
  onions' because of their resemblance to tobacco shreds.
  
  Peel and slice the onions thinly, then separate into rings.
  
  Mix the flour and the seasonings in a bowl.
  
  Heat the canola oil in a deep, heavy pan or deep-fryer to about 350
  degrees.
  
  Dredge the onion rings in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess,
  and fry until golden brown. Do small batches at a time so the rings
  don't stick together, and don't dredge the rings until they're ready
  to go into the oil or they'll give off too much moisture.
  
  Drain on paper towels. Keep warm until the rest of the onions are
  done. Serve immediately.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lg Firm apples

    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
      1 lg Egg
      1 ts Sesame oil
  1 1/3 c  Oil, preferably peanut
      2 ts Sesame oil
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
      2 tb White sesame seeds, toasted
 
  PEEL AND CORE THE APPLES and cut each into 8 large wedges. Peel the
  bananas and cut them into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Combine the flour,
  cornstarch, egg and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil in a small bowl. Mix
  them well to form a smooth, very thick batter. Combine the peanut oil
  and 2 teaspoons of sesame oil in a deep fat fryer or wok and heat the
  mixture until it is moderately hot. Put the fruit into the batter
  mixture. Then lift out several pieces of fruit at a time, using a
  slotted spoon, and drain off any excess batter. Deep-fry for about 2
  minutes, until they are golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain
  on paper towels. Repeat the process until you have deep-fried all the
  fruit. Just before serving, prepare a bowl of ice water filled with
  ice cubes. Reheat the oil over moderate heat and deep-fry the fruit a
  second time for about 2 minutes. Drain again on paper towels. Put the
  sugar, sesame seeds and 2 tablespoons of oil from the deep-frying oil
  into a pot. Heat the mixture until the sugar melts and begins to
  caramelize. (Watch the heat to prevent it from burning.) When the
  caramel is light brown, add the fruit sections. Stir them gently in
  the caramel syrup to coat them. Then take them out and put them into
  the ice water to harden. Do a few at a time to prevent them from
  sticking together. Remove them from the water and place on a serving
  platter. Serve at once.

     Butter the sides of a heavy 2 quart saucepan.  In it melt the 1 cup
  butter.  Add sugar, water, and corn syrup. Cook over medium heat to
  300 degrees, stirring frequently (mixture should boil gently over
  entire surface).  Watch carefully after 280 degrees.  Remove from
  heat. Quickly stir in the 1/2 cup coarsely chopped nuts. Immediately
  turn into a buttered 13x9x2-inch pan.  Wait for 2 to 3 minutes for
  toffee surface to firm, then sprinkle with the 1/2 cup finely chopped
  nuts. Chill till chocolate is firm, break into pieces. Makes about 1
  1/2 pound. Note: We have found that it is good to use a straight
  sided heavy bottomed pan with a 1 1/2 to 2 inch wooden spatula with
  sharp flat edge and to use a flexible metal pan to pour the mixture
  into for easy removal when cooled. Toasted chopped almonds can be
  used for pecans. Do not use margarine as a sub. for butter. Stir
  constantly after 280 degrees, scraping bottom of the pan.

    1/2 c  Brown sugar
           -not firmly packed
      3 tb Corn syrup
    1/4 c  Chopped pecans
    1/4 c  Blanched almonds, crumbled
 
   1. To pre pare yeast dough: In a large mixing bowl, sprinkle the dry
  yeast over the warm water.  Add a pinch of sugar, if desired, to
  start the yeast working.  After yeast softens a bit, stir to help
  dissolve. After a few more minutes, foam should begin to form.
  
   2.Meanwhile, remove egg from the refrigerator and place in a cup of
  hot water.  Let stand while yeast dissolves. measure out flour and
  set aside in a smaller bowl. Measure buttermilk and warm in microwave
  in glass cup. Stir the foamy yeast mixture with a wooden spoon and
  then stir in the warmed buttermilk and egg. Beat lightly to blend.
  Stir in 1 1/4 cups of the flour, the 1/4 cup sugar, the baking powder
  and salt.
  
   3. Beat at low speed of an electric mixer toblend, scrape bowl and
  then beat at medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl oc- casionally.
  Stir in enough remaining flour to make dough fairly easy to handle,
  but still soft and slightly sticky.
  
   4. Without letting the dough rise, immediately roll out to a
  rectangle that measures 15x9 inches. Measure to be sure. Spread
  surface of dough evenly with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Mix 1/4
  cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon and sprinkle over the butter. Roll
  up, starting from the wide side to form a spiral.
   Pinch edge of dough to seal. Streth and pat the roll to make it of
  even width. Slice into 15 even slices, using a knife, or tie off with
  thread.
  
   6. For topping, melt the stick of butter in a 13x9 inch glass baking
  pan. Then stir in the brown sugar and corn syrup. Tilt the pan to
  evenly distribute.
   Sprinkle evenly with the crushed nuts. Place rolls, cut sides down,
  slightly apart on top of the nuts in rows of three down and 5 across.
  Cover pan with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the rolls
  have doubled in size, about 35 minutes.
  
   7. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350~.  Bake rolls 25 to 30 minutes or
  until light golden brown.  Immediately invert pan on a foil- covered
  oblong tray and scrape any remaining nut mixture out of pan over
  rolls. Cover rolls to protect them from drying while they cool.

      Title: TOFU
 Categories: Info/tips, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  2 cups washed soybeans, preferably a large, low oil variety such as
       Vintons (Pinetree Seeds), but any will do. 6 quarts boiling water
  
  Cover beans with water and let soak for a few hours--until the beans,
  when split, have flat surfaces and break easily. The will have a pale
  color throughout--if there are sunken yellow spots, soak them longer.
  This is one of the most important steps! Do not undersoak the beans,
  and do not let them ferment (Bubbles rising to the top) or the
  results will not be as good.
  
  Drain the beans.  Bring 6 quart of water to a boil in one pan or
  kettle, and another 16 quarts to boil in a large deep pan. Turn off
  heat. Blend one cup of beans with 1 1/2 cups boiling water from the
  smaller pan until well blended. The resulting mix will look kind of
  like wet cream of wheat. Continue to blend the beans 1 cup at a time
  and add the mix to the water in the large pan.  Stir.
  
  Now you need a "tofu bag."  Old flour sacks work very well. So do 2
  non terrycloth kitchen towels sewn together into a sack. A large
  piece of cloth will suffice. Do not use cheesecloth--you need a
  tighter weave--something that the point of a straight pin can go
  through without piercing a thread, but no looser...
  
  Line a large colander with the sack (moistened with water) or the
  cloth, and place it on a rack over yet another large pan. (Canners
  work great.) Pour the stuff from the large pan into the sack and
  drain, pressing it to squeeze out all of the soymilk.
  
  You now have soymilk and okara  (the stuff in the bag). Set the okara
  aside or freeze it for later.
  
  Put the soymilk back on the stove and over med-low heat bring it to a
  simmer. This takes awhile, but you don't want to burn it. If you
  religiously stir it you can heat it up faster. It will cling to the
  pan, and skim over on top just like milk does. Bring it to a
  simmering boil and boil for 7 minutes.  If it gets a good "skim" on
  the top, remove it in one piece with a chopstick. This is called
  "Yuba" and is used in the Orient as a meat substitute.  Fried up in a
  little butter or oil it tastes like chicken skin...
  
  While the soymilk cooks, make up the coagulant:  2 teaspoons epsom
  salts in 1 cup warm water, or 2 tablespoons of nigari (and if you
  know of a source for it tell me!) in 1 cup warm water, or 2
  tablespoons of lemon juice in 1 cup warm water... Take the soymilk
  off the heat and sprinkle about 1/2 the coagulant solution gently
  over the soymilk. Cut through--do not stir--the soymilk to distribute
  the coagulant.  Let stand for a few minutes. The curds should begin
  to form. Sprinkle 1/2 the remaining coagulant in the same manner.
  Repeat as needed (you may need to mix up more solution) until you
  have white curds in pale yellow whey--no creaminess left. Now you
  need a pressing box (a 6"x8" wooden box with holes on each surface,
  and a removable top and bottom, or a colander will do ). Place the
  box on a rack over a large pan, and line it with a moistened cloth.
  Drain off as much whey as you can from the curds without disturbing
  them too much. Then gently ladle the curds into the pressing box.
  Cover the tofu (that's what you've got in the box!) with the cloth,
  put a board or plate on top and weight it down with a 3-5 pound
  weight for 20 minutes. Submerge the cloth wrapped tofu in cool water,
  remove the cloth. Store tofu in water in the refrigerator, changing
  water daily, or freeze it for an interesting texture change. It takes
  awhile, but you will end up with a couple of pounds of the best tofu
  you ever ate, a gallon or more of okara, and a couple gallons of
  whey--all for the cost of 2 cups of soybeans! Whey, btw, is great
  stuff. It's good for your skin, gentle enough to wash babies in
  (natural detergent+lecithin), makes a good liquid for bread baking,
  is a natural wood polish, and wonderful fertilizer. If you're still
  with me, I'd suggest you go out and buy "The Book of Tofu," some
  beans, and get cookin! I've got my tofu and okara made. I'm gonna
  make soysage right now--dontcha wish you were here?

    1/4 c  Soy sauce or tamari
      3 c  Pepperidge Farm Herb
           Stuffing

MMMMM----------------------BASTING MIXTURE---------------------------
    1/2 c  Toasted sesame oil
    1/4    To 1/3 cup soy sauce or
           Tamari
      2 tb Miso
      2 tb Orange juice
      1 ts Mustard of choice
      1 lb Tofu for the "drumsticks"
 
  :       -optional
  
  Mash tofu or mix well with hands.  Be sure that all of the lumps are
  out. Line a 12" colander with wet cheesecloth over lapping the sides.
  Add the mashed tofu to the cloth covered colander, press down and
  cover with the overlapping sides.  Place the whole thing in a large
  bowl. Cover the cheesecloth with a plate that fits inside the
  colander and place a 5 pound weight on the plate. Refrigerate and let
  sit for 2 to 3 hours.
  
  When time is up, start the stuffing.  Saute' the onions, celery and
  mushrooms in the 2 tablesoons sesame oil. When soft, add the garlic
  and all the rest of the stuffing ingredients, except stuffing, mixing
  well. Stir and cook for 5 minutes.  Add herb stuffing and mix well.
  
  Remove tofu from fridge and take off weight, plate and top of
  cheesecloth. Hollow out tofu to within 1 inch of the sides and
  bottom, placing the tofu in a bowl. Place the stuffing inside the
  shell and pack in firmly. Cover with the remaining tofu and pat down
  firmly. Turn stuffed tofu onto a greased baking sheet, flat side
  down. Gently press on sides of "turkey" to achieve a more oval shape.
  If desired at this point, you may mold "drumsticks" out of one pound
  of tofu, and place on each side of the "turkey".
  
  Mix up the basting mixture and baste tofu "turkey" with half of it.
  Cover the "turkey" with foil, and bake at 400 degrees for about 1
  hour.
  
  Remove foil, baste with all the remaining mixture except a few
  tablespoons and return to oven for 1 hour more, or until the "turkey"
  is golden. Remove from oven and use rest of basting mix. Using at
  least 2 large spatulars, move to a large plate.  Serve with the gravy
  of your choice, if you wish, and cranberry sauce. Tastes good
  leftover (if there is any!) in sandwiches or plain.

      Title: TOFU "FISH" STICKS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1    Kombu strip, 6 inches long
    1/2 c  ;water
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Lime juice
      2 tb Tamari
      1 ts Tarragon
      2 tb Onion; grated
     10 oz Tofu, firm
      3    Whole grain bread slices
      2    Garlic cloves
      4    Parsley sprigs
           Egg replacer for 2 eggs
 
   Wash the kombu and place it in a small saucepan with 1/2 cup water.
  Bring the water to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for
  about 10 minutes.
  
   Remove the kombu from the broth and add the lemon juice, lime juice,
  tamari, tarragon, and onion to the broth.
  
   Slice the tofu into 6 slabs about 1/4--1/2" thick and about the size
  of fish sticks.
  
   Place the tofu in a shallow dish. Pour the broth over the tofu,
  trying to distribute the onions evenly. Let this marinate for at
  least 30 minutes. If desired, you may let the tofu marinate for
  several hours in the refrigerator.
  
   Tear the slices of bread into pieces and place them in a blender or
  food processor. Gring the bread into fine crumbs. If you are using a
  food processor, you may grind the garlic and the parsley in the food
  processor along with the bread. However, if you are using a blender,
  you will probably find it necessary to press the garlic and mince the
  parsley; then add them to the crumbs and mix well.
  
   Place the seasoned bread crumbs in a plate or shallow bowl. Remove
  the tofu from the marinade (the liquid may be reserved to add to
  soups, sauces, or to marinate more tofu). Dip the tofu first into the
  beaten egg and then into the bread crumbs.
  
   Place the breaded tofu on a well-oiled cookie sheet.
   Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until it is brown and crispy.
  
   Serve these tofu sticks with a salad and a steamed vegetable. They
  are also good in sandwiches with some horseradish, lettuce, and a
  slice of tomato, or with catsup.
  
   These don't really taste like fish sticks, but they do look like
  them.

  brown. Turn them over once during the baking if necessary.
  
   Serve tofu "meat" balls with your favorite tomato sauce and whole
  wheat spaghetti. Tofu "meat" balls freeze very well, so make more
  than you need. They may be reheated by dropping them into a simmering
  sauce or stew.

      Title: TOFU "RANCH" DIP
 Categories: Digest, July, Dips, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 pk Mori-nu silken Tofu
    1/4 c  Apple cider vinegar
        x  A little water if necessary
           To make it creamier
      1 pk Hidden Valley Salad
           Dressing
 
  I have served this at parties, and no one seemed to be aware that it
  wasn't REAL Ranch dip ; )
  
  Tastes just like I remember.  Vegans beware, I think that I remember
  that there was some kind of milk by-product like whey or something in
  it, but if you avoid dairy for allergies, it doesn't seem to bother
  mine YMMV.

      Title: TOFU (4)
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -====
 
  Boil a bunch of soybeans in a big pot until they get soft. Mush them
  up somehow  a blender does a good job. You should keep enough water
  in the pot so the resulting mush is fairly liquidy maybe like a thin
  milkshake.
  
  Strain the resulting mush somehow  a few layers of cloth or a fine
  strainer depending on how finely you mushed stuff up. Try to squeeze
  out all the liquid. Put the solid part in the compost or feed it to
  your pigs or whatever.  Put the liquid part back in the pot and get
  it boiling. By the way, you now have soy milk you can just stop now
  and drink it if you'd like.
  
  Now comes the fun part, you need to put something in the boiling
  liquid to make in coagulate.  The normal thing for tofu is called
  Nagara (Ok, I don't know how to spell it). Anything acidic (lemon
  juice, lime juice, hot pepper juice, etc) will work but of course
  it'll alter the flavor a bit. Just put in enough coagulant (while
  stirring) until the stuff coagulates. It might take a few minutes.
  Turn the heat off and let it sit for ten minutes or so, then pour it
  through some cheesecloth. You can rinse the curds off to remove some
  of the flavor of the coagulant taste them first to see if you need
  too.  Press the solid part with some form of weight. The longer and
  harder you press it, the firmer it'll be. Converted by MMCONV vers.

      Title: TOFU (5)
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -====
 
  Soak 2 cups of dried soybeans overnight, then drain & rinse them, and
  combine them with an equal volume of water a cup or two at a time in a
  blender, and whiz them until smooth (about 3 minutes.)
  
  This batch of puree is then poured into a pot which has 8 cups of
  water brought to a boil, and is returned to a boil and then reduced
  to medium heat, and cooked & stirred until "the foam rises". Then,
  the liquid is poured through a clothlined colander, and the excess
  liquid is squeezed from the cloth, and the stuff in the cloth (called
  okara), is saved for another interesting experiment someday (more on
  that later), and the milk is put back in the boiling pot, and brought
  back to a boil & cooked for another 5 minutes.
  
  This netted me a little over 1/2 gallon of soy milk (actually 1/2
  gal. plus a large [16 oz.] drinking glass), which I promptly
  refrigerated. Please note: if I had been following the complete tofu
  recipe, I would have added the solidifier at this point (1 teaspoon
  of nigari dissolved in 1 cup of water), but I have neither nigari nor
  tofu pressing containers or supplies, but maybe next time...

      Title: TOFU BACON
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -==========
 
  Ingredients:
  
  1 lb     firm Tofu, cut into strips shaped like bacon 2 tblsp
  nutritional yeast 2 tblsp tamari/shoyu 1 tsp Wright's (or other
  brand) liquid smoke. 1 tblsp  oil (something neutral, not olive or
  sesame) Fry tofu strips on low or medium heat until they are crispy
  on the outside. The best way to do this is to lay them in the pan in
  the oil and let them sit for at least 10 minutes, simmering.  They
  should turn easily after that. Turn them and give them another 10
  minutes on the other side.
  
  Mix the tamari/shoyu soy sauce with the liquid smoke first, then take
  the pan off the heat.  Pour the liquid smoke/tamari into the pan and
  stir the tofu so all sides are coated, then sprinkle the yeast over
  all, stir some more, over the heat, until the liquid is gone and the
  tofu is covered with sticky yeast.
  
  Try it.  It tastes EXACTLY like bacon.
  
  Another variation is to marinate the tofu in the tamari/liquid smoke
  mixture for several hours and then fry, but it misses a little bit
  without the nutritional yeast. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40

           - cut into 1 in. squares
  1 1/2 c  Dry red wine
    1/4 c  Tamari
      4    Garlic cloves; pressed
           -Water as needed
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 c  Sliced onions
      4 c  Sliced mushrooms
      4    Bay leaves
      1 ts Thyme
      1 ts Tarragon
      4 tb Whole wheat pastry flour
 
  Place the pieces of tofu in a large, shallow dish. Mix together the
  wine, tamari, and garlic.  Pour the mixture over the tofu, add water
  as need to cover it, and let it marinate for at least one hour. If
  the tofu is going to marinate for more than an hour, place in the
  refrigerator.
  
  Place the marinated tofu on a well-oiled cookie sheet, reserving the
  marinade.  Bake at 375oF for 35-45 minutes or until crispy and brown.
  Turn the tofu over once during the baking so that it browns on both
  sides.
  
  While the tofu bakes, heat the oil in a large pan and slowly saute the
  onions.  When the onions are almost tender, add the mushrooms and the
  herbs.  Saute for a few minutes more. Add the flour and mix well.
  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in a little of the marinade.
  Continue stirring until a paste is formed. Return the pan to the heat
  and slowly add the remaining marinade, stirring constantly. Add the
  baked tofu and simmer until thickened.
  
  Serve over pasta, rice or millet.

 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea 10-12 ounce block of tofu
      2 c  Vegetable broth
      1 ea Wheat flour
      1 tb Soy oil
      1 tb Soy oil (olive oil or corn
           -oil will change the
           -taste)
    1/4 c  Water
     10 oz Of mushrooms, chopped
      1 bn Green onions, ends
           -discarded and chopped to
           -about 1 inch
           -lengths
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Clove garlic
           -a handful of chopped fresh
           -parsley leaves
           -lots of freshly ground
           -pepper to taste
    1/2 c  White wine
      1 c  Soymilk
      1 tb Cornstarch
 
  A couple of days before you will cook this, put a block of tofu in the
  freezer in a freezer container.
  
  About 24 hours before you cook, take the tofu out of the freezer.
  Pour the vegetable broth over it, and put it in the refridgerator to
  marinate. Once the tofu has thawed, cut it into slices and return to
  the marinade for at least a few more hours.
  
  When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan. Take the
  slices of tofu out of the marinade and dredge in wheat flour. Then
  fry until golden brown, turn and fry the other side. Place on a dish
  and set aside.
  
  In the same saucepan, add more oil and the water. Add the mushrooms,
  green onions, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper and saute until the
  mushrooms are soft.
  
  Mix the wine, soymilk, and cornstarch together until there are no
  lumps. Add to the saucepan and stir until mixture thickens. Then
  carefully place the tofu slices back in the saucepan. Cover, reduce
  the heat, and simmer about a minute.
  
  Serve the tofu slices with the mushroom mixture on top. Serve with a
  steamed green vegetable, such as asparagus, and a french-style bread.

      Title: TOFU JERKY
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
      3 tb To 4 tb liquid smoke
    1/8 c  Water
      1 tb Onion powder
      1 ts Garlic powder or
      1    Clove crushed fresh garlic
      1 tb Fresh ground black pepper
      1 ts Honey
      1 lb Firm or extra firm tofu
 
  Cut and drain the tofu.  I usually take a 1 lb cube, cut it in
  half,and then slice it into strips on its short side. Strips should
  be about 4-5 mm in thickness. They may look big, but they'll shrink
  to about half their size.
  
  Mix all the marinade ingredients together well. Put the tofu in a
  single layer in a shallow baking pan or cookie sheet and pour the
  marinade over it.  Let soak for several hours or overnight.
  
  Drain excess liquid (and reuse!) and dry tofu in food dehydrator or
  warm (200 F) oven.  This will take probably 4-8 hours, depending on
  weather. If you live in a sunny, dry climate (Colorado in the
  summer), you can sun dry it, it'll take all day.
  
  If you dry indoors in the winter, your house gets filled with a
  wonderful smoky smell. If you're drying in the oven, you'll need to
  flip the tofu over hourly so it dries evenly. The stuff is delicious
  and keeps indefinitely.  Dry the stuff until it's very chewy, but not
  crispy.
  
  Be creative: Use low-sodium soy if you want less salt (it is rather
  salty) Use tabasco or ground cayenne if you want it hot. Chili powder
  makes chili jerky. Oregano and basil makes pizza jerky. From:

  place the batter into a well greased casserole. Bake at 350F for 35

  pretty well in the fridge for several days. Serves 4 to 6. *When
  using this amount of nutritional yeast, be sure to use a good quality
  product.  I speak here from experience. Something like angevita is

           Oregano
           Salt
 
  Saute the chopped onion, garlic and olive oil in a saute skillet (at
  least 8"), until glassy. Add the Green pepper, mushroom and HALF the
  Newman's Dressing, reduce heat and continue to saute until peppers
  are cooked (no longer crunchy).  Add seasoning to personal
  preference. Preheat oven to 425*. Meanwhile in a large bowl, combine
  the bread crumbs (I usually just take stale bread and tear it up into
  small pieces), one can of the tomato paste, cheeses and Tofu. Beat
  the egg separately, and add to Tofu-Bread mixture. Combine until
  bread is thoroughly saturated. Add sauteed vegetables and remaining
  Newman's Dressing. The Meatloaf mixture should be cohesive enough to
  form into a loaf, but not soggy. If the mixture is too soggy, add
  more bread.  If the mixture is too crumbly, add more dressing, or
  tomato paste. Tofu has a tendency to separate, so the more bread and
  cheeses, the better. Spray a loaf pan with a non-stick cooking spray,
  and spoon tofu mixture into pan, spreading to an even level. Spoon
  remaining can of Tomato paste over tofu mixture, and spread evenly
  over the top. Bake in 425 * oven 15-25 minutes, or until juices
  bubble up around the edges.

    1/2 c  Whole black peppercorns
    1/4 c  Coriander seeds
 
  Heat the oil in a saucepan.  Saute the onions, garlic, ginger, salt,
  tumeric, cayenne, coriander, cilantro, and garam marsala for about 5
  minutes.
  
  Drain the juice from the tomatoes into the sauteed vegetables. Then
  crush the tomatoes by hand and add them to the vegetables. Dice the
  tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and add to the vegetables. Continue to cook
  for 10 to 15 minutes over low heat.  Then add the peas and cook
  another 4 minutes. Serve hot over brown rice.  A coriander coconut
  chutney (or other chutney) is an excellent accompaniment.
  
  GARAM MARSALA:  Preheat the oven to 200 F.  Place the ingredients on a
  baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes, or until the spices give off an
  aroma.  (Some chefs suggest roasting each ingredient separately,
  since each gives its characteristic aroma at a different time.)
  
  Separate the cardamom pods from the seeds.  Discard the pods. Crush
  the cinnamon.  Combine the cinnamon, cardamom seeds, and other spices
  until the mixture is powdery. Store in a sealed jar.

  Krizmanic.
  
  Crust: Mix together flours and salt. Stir in oil and mix in water.
  Chill dough while making filling.
  
  Filling: In a large saucepan, bring vegetable broth to a boil over
  medium-high heat. Add potatoes, cover and cook 5 minutes. Add carrots,
  onions, and celery. Cover and cook 3 minutes. Add peas and-or corn and
  mushrooms. Cover and cook 2 minutes or until tender.
  
  Combine flour, pepper and poultry seasoning. Add soy milk or water

      Title: TOFU POTATO SALAD WITH DILL
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 lg Potatoes
    1/2 ts Salt
     10 oz Soft (MoriNu) lite tofu
      2    To 3 cloves garlic, minced
           Water for steaming
      4 tb Fresh dill weed (or 1-1/2
        tb Dried dill)
      2    To 3 Tbs. brown rice
           Vinegar
           Or lemon juice
           Water if needed for
           Blending
      2 ts Low-sodium tamari
      4    Stalks celery, minced
      2 ts Prepared mustard
    1/2 c  Minced fresh parsley
 
  Slightly adapted from the Vegetarian Times
  
  Bake, boil, microwave, or pressure cook potatoes until tender. Run
  under cold water to remove skins.  Chill.
  
  Meanwhile, steam tofu for 10 minutes.  While tofu is cooking, place
  rice vinegar (lemon juice), oil (if desired), tamari, mustard, salt
  and garlic in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth.
  
  Drain tofu, crumble and add to blender or food processor along with
  dill. Blend until smooth and creamy. You may need to add a few
  tablespoons of water (up to 1/4 cup) depending on how soft the tofu
  is and how well your blender purees.  You will want it a little
  "loose" and liquidy, as the potatoes will absorb some of the moisture.
  
  Chop chilled potatoes into 1-inch cubes and place in a large mixing
  bowl. Pour tofu mixture on top of potatoes and mix, evenly coating
  potatoes. Stir in celery and parsley. Be careful not to mash potatoes
  as you mix. Makes 6 side-dish servings.

      Title: TOFU PROVENCAL
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Firm tofu; patted dry
           -- and cut into 1/2" cubes
      3    Garlic cloves; minced
      2 md Onions; chopped
     35 oz Canned plum tomatoes w/juice
           -- (chopped)
      1 tb Tomato paste
      2 c  Diced green beans
    1/2 ts Dried basil
    1/2 ts Dried oregano
      1    Bay leaf
           Pepper; to taste
 
  Heat a bit of oil in large skillet.  Stir fry tofu until golden.
  Remove from pan and drain.
  
  Saute garlic and onions for about 5 mins.  Add tomatoes, their juice
  and tomato paste, stir until blended.
  
  Return tofu to pan, add remaining ingredients and toss thoroughly.
  Cover and simmer 15 mins or until green beans are tender. If sauce is
  too thin boil uncovered to reduce.
  
  We LOVE this quick simple dish; sometimes I will substitute Zukes, or
  squash, or mushrooms for all or part of the tofu. Enjoy.
  
  A quick easy companion dish:
  
  One box of NEAR EAST Bulghur Pilaf and some fresh mushrooms.
  
  Slice mushrooms and add to sauce pan.  Pour on water needed for Pilaf
  and bring to a boil add NE mix and simmer 15 minutes. It is GREAT!

    1/3 c  Picante sauce, your choice
 
  make or buy a regular pie crust.  bake it at 375 for about 10 min. or
  until starting to get done.  remove pie crust from oven. or make
  oatmeal and walnut pie crust, i tried it, i prefer regualar. in food
  processor or blender, whirrrrrrr up the tofu block (drained) and
  eggs, milk, spices. stir in half the grated cheese. last of all, stir
  in picante sauce (but don't whirrrr) and broccoli (but don't
  whirrrr.) you can add ingredients to make this even hotter, use your
  imagination. you may also add meat, your choice. chicken wouldn't be
  bad. fold all these ingredients which are now in suspended animation
  in the tofu-egg-cheese mixture, into the ready pie crust, and add
  rest of cheese on top. bake at about 375 for about 35 to 40 mins.
  quiche is done when a fork in the middle comes out clean. it will cut
  much better after cool. the predominant taste will be the hot sauce
  and you won't taste tofu or anything weird, but you will know you are
  getting low-cal nourishment from the lowly bean and you can act smug
  around your friends.

  Pre-heat oven to 300F. Cut the marinated tofu slices lengthwise into 3
  strips per slice. Brush the tofu slices on all sides with oil and lay
  them, side by side, in a dish. The slices should not touch. Bake for
  40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Pass
  bamboo skewers carefully through the width of each slice. Five to six
  slices will fit on one skewer without touching.  Cover with barbecue
  sauce and pre-heat the broiler. Broil 6 inches from the heat for
  about 5 minutes, turn over, and repeat. The tofu can become dark but
  scorching will make it bitter.

  a bit less oil. For lasagna, manicotti, etc, saute finely minced
  onion and garlic in the oil before adding.  I usually leave the salt
  out as we are not salt eaters, but the flavor is closer to ricotta's
  with the salt.)

   Sprinkle with salt.
  
   2.  Combine all ingredients except pita bread and lettuce. Cover and
  refrigerate for one hour to blend flavors.
  
   3.  Line pita pockets with leaf lettuce and fill with tofu salad.
  
   To press tofu, cut tofu block into 2 or 4 equal pieces and lay on a
  plate covered with paper towels or a clean dish cloth. Cover with
  more paper towels or dish cloth. Place another plate on top and on
  top of the plate put a heavy object. Let stand from 20 minutes to one
  hour, changing paper towels as they become soaked.
   The longer you press, the firmer the tofu will be.

      Title: TOFU TURKEY
 Categories: Vegetarian, Holiday
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      5 lb Medium firm tofu
    1/2 c  Sesame oil (no substitutes)
    1/4 c  Tamari
 
  Mash tofu well. (For optimal results, blend a firm Chinese style tofu
  with a smaller portin of Japanese style, such as Mori-Nu Firm.) Line
  an 11" colander with a single layer of moistened cheesecloth.
  Transfer tofu to colander. Press tofu to flatten, and fold edges of
  cheesecloth over it. Place a cake tin or other flat object over the
  surface of the tofu and weigh it down with a heavy object (about 5
  lbs) to press the liquid from the tofu.
  
  After the tofu has drained for 1 hour, hollow out to within 1 inch of
  the colander. Fill the cavity with your favorite stuffing. Pack in
  stuffing and cover with the remaining tofu. Pat down so surface is
  flat and firm. Oil a roast or turkey pan, place pan over colander,
  and flip over so that flat surface of filled tofu faces down. Remove
  cheesecloth.
  
  Mix sesame oil and soy sauce to use as a basting liquid. Baste tofu
  with liquid. Bake covered at 400 deg. F for 1 hour. Remove cover,
  baste, and return to oven to bake uncovered until top becomes golden
  brown, about one hour more. Baste again at least once during
  remaining cooking time.

      Title: TOFU WITH 3 SPICES
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -==================
 
  Ingredients:
  
  1 tsp    cornstarch (or arrowroot) 1/2 tsp sugar (optional) 3 tblsp
  cold water 3 tblsp soy or shoyu sauce 1 tblsp sesame seed oil
  
  1 lb.    firm tofu 3 tblsp oil 1 tsp minced garlic 1 tsp grated fresh
  ginger root 2 scallions, diced (or 4 tblsp diced onions) 1/2 tsp salt
  Drain the tofu, then cut into 1 X 1 X 1/2 inch pieces. Drain again.
  Heat a skillet or wok.  Add the oil and heat about 30 seconds. Add
  the garlic, ginger, scallions and salt. Stir fry about 30 seconds.
  Add the tofu. Stir fry about 2 minutes.
  
  Mix together the cornstarch, sugar, water, soy sauce and sesame oil.
  Add the mixture to the skqillet and stir well, then cook about
  another 30 seconds.
  
  Serve with or over rice or noodles.
  
  Helpful hints:
  
  Ginger root is wonderful, but may not keep well in the refrigerator.
  Keep it wrapped in plastic in the freezer and pull it out and grate
  as you need it.  It will keep a long time and is still delicious.
  Scallions are best, but regular onions will do in a pinch.
  
  The original recipe called for Worchester sauce and soy sauce, but I
  substitute all soy, because, as well all know, Worchester contains
  anchovies. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40

 Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Firm Tofu
        x  Nutritional Yeast
 
  If you've tried tofu burgers you'll love Tofu Yeasties! They are also
  quick and easy.
  
  1.Slice firm tofu about 1/4 inch thick (to yield the largest patty).
  Be sure to use a high quality firm tofu.
  
  2.Dip the tofu slices in soy sauce (both sides).
  
  3.Place the slices on a plate of nutritional yeast until they are
  thoroughly breaded (don't use brewer's yeast unless you know the
  difference!). I prefer to use Red Star brand nutritional yeast.
  
  4.Fry both sides at medium high on a non-stick surface until light
  brown. No oil is required.
  
  5.Serve as you would any veggiburger.

      1    (8-ounce) package
           Medium-size egg noodles,

    1/2 c  Chopped onion
    1/4 c  Chopped green pepper
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine, melted
      3 tb All-purpose flour
      3 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      1 tb Poppy seeds
      1 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Red pepper
      3 c  Diced cooked tofu
      1    (4-ounce) jar diced
           Pimiento, drained
      2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Cook noodles according to package directions.  Drain well, and set
  aside. Sauti onion and green pepper in butter in a Dutch oven until
  tender; add flour, stirring until smooth. Cook 1 minute, stirring
  constantly. Gradually add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring
  constantly, until thickened and bubbly.  Stir in noodles, 1/4 cup
  Parmesan cheese, poppy seeds, salt, red pepper, and tofu; add
  pimiento, and stir gently. Spoon mixture into a lightly greased 12- x
  8- x 2-inch baking dish. Cover and chill 8 hours. To bake, remove
  from refrigerator, and let stand at room temperature 30 min. Bake,
  covered, at 350 for 45 min. Uncover, and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons
  cheese. Bake, uncovered, an additional 10 min. or until thoroughly
  heated.
  
  1. I use one pound of tofu cut into 1 inch squares instead of turkey.
  (I am a vegitarian.)
  
  2. It does not have to refrigerate, but the tastes do mingle better
  if it does.
  
  3. I usually sprinkle more than 2 tablespoons of cheese on top.

      Title: TOFU/MISO/UMEBOSHI(SALTED PRESERVED PLUMS) OK
 Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Short grained japanese style
           Rice (wash thoroughly)
      4 c  Water
      2    3 rounded tablespoon white
           Miso paste (more or less to
           Taste)
      1    Or 2 large salted preserved
           Salted plums---umeboshi (to
           Taste)
      1    Cake kinugoshi tofu
      1 c  Fresh spinach
      1 c  Fresh nappa cabbage
    1/8 ts Sake or mirin (optional)
 
  "Okayu" - Japanese-style porridge.
  
  While you wait for your water to boil:
  
  Break apart tofu into little chunks (dice or just use hands) Wash
  spinach well and cut into 1/4" segments Wash nappa cabbage and cut
  into 1/4" segments take seed out of umeboshi and cut into small pieces
  
  When water is at a nice rolling boil:
  
  Add miso (make sure it completely dissolves in water) (At this stage,
  taste to make sure you have enough miso in water and add more miso or
  water for desired taste.) Add rice, tofu, spinach, nappa cabbage, and
  umeboshi Add mirin or sake (optional)
  
  Once the mixture come back to a nice boil, put cover on pot and
  reduce heat to low simmer for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally. Cook
  longer if you like a more creamier porridge.
  
  This makes a nice replacement for soup on a cold day. If eaten as a
  meal, I like to puree some raw daikon with a tiny smidgin of fresh
  ginger, lemon juice, and soy sauce as a garnish on top of my okayu.

      Title: TOM KA GAI (CHICKEN & COCONUT MILK SOUP)
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
     12 oz Canned coconut milk
           -- such as Chaokoh
    1/4 lb Chicken breast
           -- cut into small chunks
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel
      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe
  below).
  
  Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let
  stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan,
  place the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or
  ginger, and (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you
  don't want the whole dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the
  earlier you add them, the hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the
  coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and
  stir to distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just
  below a boil and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken
  pieces are finished cooking. Remove from heat and serve immediately
  with fresh cilantro leaves for garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh
  grouper instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead
  of the ginger, and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai
  birds. We also served it over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it
  southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who cares, it was wonderful. If you
  can't find grouper, it'd be good with any tender, delicate white fish
  ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or maybe little chunks of
  monkfish. I believe I've had this with shrimp as well. (Grouper, BTW,
  is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I recall, in other
  warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white, very tender,
  and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian grocery
  store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd guess that
  Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome
  available in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can
  usually find it frozen. (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't
  find it at Tin Tin or the New Castro Market, you have to have friends
  smuggle it in from Bangkok for you...  Other parts of the country may
  vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I
  could barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and
  mild. I like it in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I
  can tell it isn't edible unless you puree it. (If there's sufficient
  demand, I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just
  eat around the slices of lemon grass and ginger.

      5    Green Thai chili peppers,
           ; crushed
 
  A rich, aromatic dinner soup, which is enjoyed throughout the meal.
  Whenever possible, fresh kaffir lime leaves should be used, and their
  flavor and aroma is increased when they are torn instead of cut with a
  knife.  Young galangal is pale yellow, with firm unwrinkled pink
  shoots. Fresh young ginger can be substituted if necessary, but the
  flavor will not be quite the same.
  
  Combine half the coconut milk with the galangal, lemon grass and lime
  leaves in a large saucepan and heat to boiling. Add the chicken, fish
  sauce and sugar.
  
  Simmer for about 4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked . Add the
  remaining coconut milk to the saucepan and heat just to boiling.
  
  Place the lime juice and chili past in a serving bowl, then pour the
  soup into the serving bowl.
  
  Garnish with the torn cilantro leaves and crushed chili peppers, and
  serve.

      1 tb Vanilla extract
    2/3 c  Brandy or whiskey
 
  Makes 8 - 8 inch loaves. Prepare fruits and nuts as desired. Beat
  eggs in mixer. Begin creaming the butter. While butter is creaming,
  add just enough flour to the fruits and nuts to give each a thin
  coating so it won't stick to its neighbor. When the butter is
  properly creamed, add eggs, sugar, molasses and soda, spices,
  remaining flour, vanilla and brandy. Let mixer go to work on that.
  Scoop a depression in the top of the fruit-nut pile and pour the
  batter over it. Then mix and knead almost like you would knead bread.
  Pack into 8 (8") well-buttered foil loaf pans which have been lined
  with foil or brown paper and buttered. Place in a 225 degree oven
  with a shallow pan of water below them. If the oven temperature is
  right, they should be done in 3 to 4 hours. After 1-1/2 hours watch
  them carefully, and if the edges begin to crisp before the to cracks
  in numerous breaks, turn the heat down and put in a fresh pan of cool
  water. When little cracks come across the tops of the cakes they are
  done. When cool, remove them from the pans. When cold dab whiskey or
  brandy liberally over the outside. Wrap each separately in wax paper,
  then in aluminum foil. Cover with newspaper and set away to age in a
  cool place. This aging takes about a month; the alcohol will have
  evaporated by then and have left only the bouquet and flavor.

  (Thai Chicken in Lemon Grass Soup) This is from Charmaine Solomon's
  newest publication: THAI COOKBOOK.
  
  TO MAKE PEPPER AND CORIANDER PASTE: This is a basic Thai flavoring
  and will make about one cup which you can store in your fridge. You
  will use about one teaspoon of it in the Tom Yum Gai. In a dry
  skillet, dry roast about one Tbs whole black peppercorns for a minute
  or two.
  
  In your blender whizz up the peppercorns together with 2 or 3 garlic
  cloves, 2 tsp salt, 2 Tbs lemon juice, and a big bunch of fresh
  coriander (cilantro) which you have coarsely chopped, stems and roots
  included (about 2 cups).
  
  TO MAKE THE SOUP: Whack each drumstick in two. Whizz up the garlic,
  chillies, and Pepper and Coriander Paste together in your blender,
  and mix with the chicken. Allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Place the
  stock, lime leaves (or zest), onions, galangal, lemon grass, and
  sugar in a large saucepan together with the chicken and simmer about
  30 minutes or until chicken is tender. Add fish sauce and lime juice.
  Adjust flavorings for spicy and sour to your taste. Serve garnished
  with coriander and sliced chillies.
  
  NOTES: Be aware that the fresh chillies used for this recipe are very
  acidic. Thorougly wash your hands after handling. DO NOT rub your eyes
  until you have washed your hands. Submitted By CHIAPET1@IX.NETCOM.COM

      Title: TOM YUM GOONG (HOT & SOUR SHRIMP SOUP) #1
 Categories: Thailand, Soups/stews, Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Shelled shrimp (reserve
           -shells)
      3 tb Peanut or other vegetable
           -oil
      1 c  Chicken stock
      5 c  Water
      8    Khaffir lime leaves
           -(substitute zest of lime)
      3    Stalks lemon grass, each
           -cut into 3 sections and
           -crushed
      1 tb Fish sauce
      6    Ozs fresh mushrooms,
           -quartered (or 1 can straw
           -mushrooms)
      3 tb Fish sauce
      3 tb Fresh lime juice
      3    Fresh red chillies, sliced
           -(use Thai birdseye chilies
           -if you
           Coriander leaves
           Chopped scallions
        cn Find them)
 
  In 4-quart pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil.  Add shrimp and stir-fry
  briefly until pink but not done.  Remove shrimp and reserve. Add
  tablespoon oil and stir-fry shells until pink. Add stock and water,
  lime leaves, lemon grass, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce. Bring to boil.
  Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes, covered. Strain broth and set
  aside until ready to serve. Discard shrimp shells but save lemon
  grass and lime leaves to serve in soup. TO ASSEMBLE SOUP:  Add
  mushrooms to broth (if using straw nushrooms drain them first) and
  simmer until done,about 5 minutes. Add shrimp and simmer briefly
  until done (DO NOT OVERCOOK). Just before serving, add fish sauce,
  lime juice, and chillies, garnish with coriander leaves and
  scallions. Notes: Khaffir lime leaves, lemon grass, fish sauce, fresh
  coriander, and Thai birdseye chillies are available in Asian grocery
  stores. Use any fresh hot chili if unable to find the Thai ones.
  Although the lime leaves and lemon grass are returned to the soup for
  serving, they are flavorings only and are not eaten.  Use zest of
  about 1/2 lemon if unable to find lemon grass. If you can find shrimp
  with the heads on, fry the heads as well as the tail shells for a
  richer broth. Discard with shells. From The Cookie Lady's Files

  This is the quintessential Thai soup aromatic, flavorful,
  citrus-scented, delicious. If this doesn't hook you on Thai cooking
  and gardening, nothing will. Serves four. Adapted from Southeast

  Shell and devein shrimp, reserving heads and shells. Place shells and
  heads in a large saucepan. Add water, lemongrass and Siamese ginger.
  
  Using a mortar and pestle, pound two of the chilies with the coriander
  roots and add to pan. Add the salt and five of the lime leaves,
  shredded into little pieces.
  
  Bring the soup to a boil and simmer uncovered 20 to 25 minutes. Strain
  stock into a clean pan. Don't panic if it doesn't taste wonderful at
  this point because the seasoning adjustments will make a big
  difference.
  
  A few minutes before serving, bring the stock to a boil, add the
  shrimp and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add the nam pla, lemon and lime
  juices and the straw mushrooms. Adjust seasoning. The flavor should
  be tangy.
  
  Serve in bowls garnished with strips of remaining chili, shredded
  lime leaf and coriander leaves.

        3    Plum tomatoes -- peeled,
  :          seeded and c
        2 TB unsalted butter
  :          salt -- to taste
  :          pepper -- to taste
      1/3 c  Parmesan cheese
        1 TB fresh basil -- chopped
        5 c  chicken stock
      1/2 c  White Wine
        2 TB unsalted butter
        1 TB oil
      1/3 c  onion -- finely minced
    1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
  
  To Prepare the fresh tomatoes, drop them into boilg salted water (the
  salt helps to retain the red color) for 30 seconds, then immediately
  run them under cold water. With a knife, peel the skins off and
  scrape our the seeds with a speen , or squeeze the tomatoes to remove
  the cores. (Personally I perfer to use a swivel peeler to peel to
  tomatoes and squeeze the seeds out, they retain their flavor much
  better this way!) Coarsely chop the tomatoes.
  
  Heat the butter (first 2 tablespoons) in a skillet over moderate heat
  and add the tomatoes. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes, until the tomatoes
  become tender andturn a red-orange color. Add salt and pepper to
  taske. Turn off the heat and set aside.
  
  Bring the broth to a steady simmer in a saucepan on top of the stove.
  
  Heat the butter and oil in a heavy 4-quart casserole over moderate
  heat. (Instead of a casserole, we just use a sauce pan that will hold
  the finished product.) Add the onion and saut=E9 for 1 or 2 minutes,
  until it begins to soften, being careful not to brown it.
  
  Add the rice to the onions; using a wooden speen, stir for 1 minute,
  making sure all the grains are well coated. Add the wine and stir
  until it is completely absorbed. Begin to add the simmering broth,
  1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until each addition is
  almost completely absorbed before adding the next 1/2 cup, reserving
  about 1/4 cup to add at the end. Stir frequently to preven sticking.
  
  After approximately 18 minutes, when the rice is tender but still
  firm, add the reserved broth and the tomatoes. Turn off the heat and
  immediately add the remaining condimenti-Parmesan and basil-and stir
  vigorously to combine with the rice. Serve Iimmediately.
  
  VARIATION: Add a pince a saffron to the rice when you begin to add the
  broth. It will lend an intese orage hue to the risotto. Recipe By

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Recipe puff pastry
      1    Recipe Thick Tomato Coulis
      6 md Vine ripened tomatoes
      3 tb Shredded basil
      1    Oil
           Salt and pepper
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman TOMATO AND BASIL TARTS
  Quickly roll out the pastry and cut out six 4-5" rounds. Place rounds
  on a thick baking sheet and sprinkle with a little cold water. Place
  baking sheet in freezer until ready to assemble and bake tarts. Slice
  the tomatoes and lay them on paper towels for thirty minutes to drain
  off excess moisture. This will prevent the tarts from being soggy.
  One half hour before serving, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Take
  the baking sheet from the freezer and spread a layer of Thick Tomato
  Coulis over the pastry rounds leaving 1/2 inch rim around the edge.
  Arrange the drained tomato slices over the coulis and scatter with
  shredded basil. Sprinkle with salt and some freshly grated black
  pepper then drizzle with oil. Immediately place in the oven and bake
  for 20 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and golden. Serve at
  once.

 Categories: Vegetables, Main-dish, Pies/tarts
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------NORMA WRENN SERVES 10-12-----------------------
  2 1/2 lb Yellow onions; coarsely chop
      6    Fresh thyme sprigs <OR>
      2 pn Dried thyme
    1/4 c  Olive oil
           Salt/freshly ground pepper
      1 tb Fresh rosemary; minced <OR>
      1 ts Dried rosemary
           Yeast Dough or Pie Dough
      3 oz Gorgonzola cheese
      1 lg Large cherry tomatoes or
           Plum tomatoes; sliced cross
           -wise 1/3" thick
      1 lg Egg; beaten
 
  In a large, heavy, nonreactive saucepan, cook the onions and thyme
  over moderate heat, stirring once or twice, until the onions start to
  turn golden, about 15 minutes.
  
  Add 3 tablespoons of the oil, cover and cook over low heat, scraping
  the pan every 10 minutes, until the onions are browned, about 1 hour.
  Season with salt and pepper and 2 teaspoons of the fresh rosemary (or
  all the dried rosemary).  Let cool.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  On a lightly floured baking sheet
  without sides, roll out the galette dough into a 14-inch round.
  (Alternatively, divide the dough into 4 even pieces and roll into
  8-inch rounds.) Spread the filling over the dough, leaving a 2-inch
  border. Crumble the cheese on top and overlap the tomatoes in a ring.
  Season with salt and pepper and drizzle on the remaining 1 tablespoon
  oil. Fold up and pleat the border of the dough.  Brush the dough with
  the egg.
  
  Bake the galette until the crust is golden, about 20 minutes for Yeast
  Dough and 35 minutes for Pie Dough. Sprinkle the remaining 1 teaspoon
  fresh rosemary over the top and serve hot or warm.

 Categories: Breakfasts, Suntomato
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -Robbie Shelton
           9" Pie Shell; unbaked
    1/2 c  Sun-Dried Tomatoes;
           -marinated in oil
      1 c  Italian Fontina Cheese;
           -grated
    1/3 c  Scallions; thinly sliced
  1 1/4 c  Half-and-Half
      2 lg Eggs
           White Pepper; to taste
 
     Prick the bottom of the pie shell with a fork. Chill for 30
  minutes or freeze for 15 minutes.
  
     Preheat the oven to 425F.  Line the pie shell with waxed paper and
  fill with pie weights or beans.  Bake for 10 minutes, remove the
  paper and weights, and continue to bake for another 5 to 6 minutes,
  or until golden. Reduce the oven temperature to 375F and cook the pie
  shell while you prepare the filling.
  
     In a bowl, toss together the tomatoes, cheese, and scallions.
  Sprinkle the mixture evenly in the pie shell. In a bowl, whisk
  together the half- and-half, eggs, and pepper. Pour into the shell
  and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted 1/2 inch
  from the edge comes out clean. The custard in the center of the
  quiche won't be fully set, but it will continue to cook after being
  removed from the oven. Let stand for about 20 minutes.  Serve warm.
  
     Although other cheeses, especially Swiss, work well with this
  recipe, it is really worth the effort to seek out a high-quality
  fontina cheese. The nutty, sweet flavor of fontina and it's terrific
  texture when melted are a wonderful complement to the salty, chewy
  tomatoes.

      Title: TOMATO & LEEK CASSEROLE
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5    Or 6 large leeks
      2 lb Firm tomatoes
        x  Ff grated cheese (amount
           Optional according to
           Taste)
        x  Bread crumbs
        x  Red wine vinegar
        x  Marjoram, thyme, sage,
           Pepper, rosemary
 
  Slice leeks and tomatoes.  Layer in casserole dish (leeks on the
  bottom so the juice from the tomatoes helps cook them
  :).  Sprinkle with red wine vinegar. Add cheese. Add layer of bread
  crumbs. Spice according to taste. (Repeat layer if desired). Cook at
  375 until bread crumbs are golden.
  
  The amounts of ingredients in this one can be varied. Some ppl prefer
  more tomatoes, while I am allergic to them so tend to skimp there
  :)  The lack of cooking time is due to the origination of the recipe.
  I learned it in Holland and the oven temps there are far different
  from here. We usually made it in some old nearly broken down toaster
  oven so the time varied with each attempt
  :)  I have found many non vegan friends love this recipe.

 Categories: Other sauce
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Tomatoes, peeled -- seeded
           And chopped
      3 tb Sun-dried tomatoes packed in
           Oil -- finely chopped
      2 tb Oil from sun-dried tomatoes
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 lb Pancetta or slab bacon --
           Diced
    1/4 c  Parsley -- finely chopped
           Salt, if necessary
 
  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine fresh tomatoes with
  sun-dried tomatoes; set aside.
  
  2. Pour oils into a 9- by 13-inch baking dish; place in the oven to
  heat the oil, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add pancetta and return to the
  oven until pancetta starts to brown, tossing occasionally with a
  spatula, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes.
  
  3. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are
  cooked and form a sauce.
  
  4. Remove from oven; stir in parsley. Season with salt, if necessary.
  
  5. To serve: Cook 1 pound dried pasta, such as fusilli
  (spiral-shaped) in salted water, following package directions. Drain.
  Serve sauce over pasta and pass 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan
  cheese at table.
  
  * Timesaver Tip: Sauce can be made up to 6 hours ahead, covered, and
  refrigerated, or it can be frozen. To freeze, spoon into a freezer
  container, cover, label, and freeze at 0 degrees F up to 2 months. To
  serve, defrost sauce 15 to 20 minutes in microwave oven on Defrost
  setting, stirring several times, or thaw in refrigerator 8 to 24
  hours. Gently warm sauce in a saucepan or microwave oven on 50% power
  until warmed through, about 3 minutes, whisking frequently and
  vigorously to bring it to a creamy consistency.

      Title: TOMATO & VEGETABLE JUICE BLEND
 Categories: Beverages, Canning
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Quantity: An average of 22 pounds of tomatoes is needed per canner
  load of 7 quarts. Not more than 3 cups of other vegetables may be
  added for each 22 pounds of tomatoes.
  
  Procedure: Crush and simmer tomatoes as for making tomato juice. Add
  no more than 3 cups of any combination of finely chopped celery,
  onions, carrots, and peppers for each 22 pounds of tomatoes. Simmer
  mixture 20 minutes. Press hot cooked tomatoes and vegetables through
  a sieve or food mill to remove skins and seeds. Add bottled lemon
  juice or citric acid to jars (See acidification directions). Add 1
  teaspoon of salt per quart to the jars, if desired. Reheat
  tomato-vegetable juice blend to boiling and fill immediately into
  jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process.
  Recommended process times are given in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.

           Homemade Mayonnaise
           Lemon juice
 
  Sprinkle gelatin over water in a saucer.  Meanwhile, heat crushed
  tomatoes in a saucepan.  Stir softened gelatin into the tomatoes off
  the heat. Add onion, green pepper, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco,
  vinegar or lemon juice, pepper, and salt.  Mix thoroughly and pour
  into a 6-cup ring mold. Refrigerate for several hours, or until
  thoroughly set. To serve, loosen the aspic by placing the mold
  briefly in a pan of hot water. Then turn it onto a serving plate,
  making sure it is centered. Re-refrigerate until it has set again.
  Toss the crabmeat with the mayonnaise and a bit of lemon juice, and
  heap into the middle of the aspic ring. The crabmeat salad should not
  be too seasoned because the aspic is very spicy. Serves 6-8. Source:

           -Maria Arico-CWJS00A
      1 cl Garlic
      2 tb Onion; finely chopped
      1 tb Oil from tomatoes
  2 1/2 ts Active dry yeast or
      1 sm Cake Fresh Yeast
    1/4 c  Warm Water
      1 c  Water; room temperature
    1/2 c  Oil-packed sun-dried tomato;
           -coarsely
  3 3/4 c  Unbleached A-P flour
      2 ts Salt
      1    Egg white
 
  Lightly saute the garlic and onion in the oil; let cool to room
  temperature. Stir the yeast into the warm water in a large bowl; let
  stand until creamy, abaoaut 10 minutes. Stir in the other cup of
  water and the garlic and onion with the oil, then stir in the
  tomatoes. Mix the flour and salt and stir 1 cup at a time into the
  yeast mixture. Knead on a lightly floured surface, sprinkling with 2
  to 3 tablespoons additional flour as needed, until the dough is soft,
  velvety and slightly moist, 8 to 10 minutes. IN PROCESSOR-Stir the
  yeast in 1/4 c warm water in a small bowl; lete stand until creamy,
  about 10 minutes. Place the flour and salt in a processor fitted with
  the steel blade or dough blade and process briefly to sift. Place the
  garlic and onion with the oil and the tomatoes on top of the flour.
  With the machine running, pour the dissolved yeast and the 1 cup of
  water through the feed tube as quickly as the flour can absorb it.
  Process until the dough comes together. Process 30 seconds longer to
  knead. The dough will be velvety, elastic and salmon colored. Finish
  kneading briefly by hand on a floured surface, it you want. 1st
  rise-Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap
  and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Shaping and Second

  briefly. Shape the dough into a ball. Place on a lightly oiled baking
  sheete or a peel sprinkled with flour; coveer with a towel and let
  rise until doubled, about 45 to 55 minutes. Baking-Heat oven to 425.
  If using a baking stone, turn the oven on 30 minutes before baking
  and sprinkle the stone with cornmeal just before sliding the loaf
  onto it. Make 3 parallet slashed on the top of the loaf with a razor.
  Brush the top with the egg white. Bake 10 minutes, spraying 3 times
  with water. Reduce the heat to 375~ and bake 25 to 30 minutes longer.

MMMMM------------------WALDINE VAN GEFFEN VC42A-----------------------
      2 c  Tomato juice
    1/2 c  Canned tomato sauce
      2 tb Olive oil
      6 c  All-purpose flour; to 6-1/2
      2 pk Active dry yeast
      3 tb Brown sugar
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Dried oregano
    1/2 ts Dried basil
    1/4 ts Ground rosemary
    1/4 ts Ground fennel
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
      2 sm Cloves garlic; crushed
 
  Lightly grease large bowl and 2 9x5x3" loaf pans with olive oil. Set
  aside. In small saucepan, heat tomato juice, sauce and 2 tb olive oil
  to 120~. In large mixer bowl, combine 3 cups flour with yeast and
  remaining ingredients. Pour in tomato mixture and beat thoroughly for
  3 minutes. Gradually add remaining 3 to 3-1/2 c flour, mixing by hand
  if necessary until it holds together enough to turn out onto floured
  surface. The dough is quite sticky and you may need to add a tad more
  flour, but don't add an excessive amount or you will have a dry
  bread. Knead about 5 minutes until dough smooths out. Place dough in
  greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
  Punch dough down, let rest 15 minutes, the shape into 2 loaves and
  place in prepared pans. Cover pans and let dough rise an additional
  45 minutes or until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 375~. Bake
  loaves 10 minutes, reduce heat to 350~ and bake 30 to 40 minutes
  more. Bread is done when loaves sound hollow when thumped with
  knuckle. Tip loaves out immediately onto wire racks to cool. Source:

  SOURCE: National Gardening, June '90.
  
  This easy-to-make soup gives a whole new, flavorful meaning to the
  term 'broth'.  It can be served hot or cold.
  
  Peel tomatoes by dropping them into boiling water for 1 minute. Under
  cool water, slip off peels.  Coarsely chop and place in a 4 quart
  saucepan with remaining ingredients except the chicken broth. Simmer
  uncovered, over medium heat for 25 minutes.
  
  Remove bay leaf and transfer soup to a blender or food processor.
  Puree for 30 seconds.  Set up a food mill or colander over the
  original saucepan, and press the pureed soup through the mill into
  the pan. Add the broth; simmer until ready to serve.  Garnish with
  snow peas.

      Title: TOMATO CROTON OMELETTE
 Categories: Eggs, Main dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      4    Eggs
      3 tb Milk
      2    Tomatoes, skinned
           - and sliced
           A few chopped chives
      3 tb Crotons
           Salt and pepper
           Parmesan to garnish
 
  Blissful summer food. Use tomatoes that are as fresh as possible for
  the best results here. The crunch of crotons in the filling is
  utterly mouth-watering, and gives this omelette a distinction quite
  its own.
  
  Beat the eggs with the milk and season with salt and pepper. Lightly
  grease a heavy frying-pan and pour in the mixture. (If you do not
  have a pan large enough, make two omelettes separately.) As it begins
  to set, place the sliced tomatoes on top and sprinkle with the
  chives. Season with salt and pepper and finally toss in the crotons.
  Fold the omelette in half and serve as soon as possible, sprinkled
  with a little grated Parmesan.

      Title: TOMATO EGG DROP SOUP
 Categories: Chinese, Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 qt Chicken stock
      2 md Fresh tomatoes, or: drained
      1 c  -canned tomatoes
      2 sm Eggs
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
      2 ts Light soy sauce
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Finely chopped scallions
           - white part only
           - (reserve tops for garnish)
 
  Egg Drop Soup is traditionally Chinese. Tomatoes are not. They were
  introduced less than 100 years ago, but nevertheless, they work
  wonderfully in this soup.
  
  PUT THE CHICKEN STOCK into a pot and bring to a simmer. If using fresh
  tomatoes, peel, seed and cut into 1-inch cubes. If using canned
  tomatoes, chop them into small chunks. Lightly beat the eggs, then
  combine them with sesame oil in a small bowl. Add the light soy sauce
  and salt to the simmering stock, and stir to mix them in well. Add
  the tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes. Next, stir in the scallions,
  and then add the egg mixture in a very slow, thin stream. Using a
  chopstick or fork, pull the egg slowly into strands. (Stirring the
  egg in a "figure 8" works well.) Garnish with the finely chopped
  scallion tops.

      Title: TOMATO FENNEL & POTATO STEW
 Categories: Soups, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Potatoes
           - red or yellow-fleshed
      2    Fennel bulbs
      1 lb Ripe tomatoes; peeled
           -and seeded, juice reserved
           -=OR=-
      2 c  -whole canned tomatoes
           Salt
      4 tb Virgin olive oil
      1 lg Leek; white part only,
           - finely  diced
      1 lg Yellow onion
           - cut into wedges 1/2" thick
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 ts Herbes de Provence
      3 pn Saffron threads
      1 lg Strip orange zest (2" long)
      2    Bay leaves
      1 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Chopped parsley
     12    Nicoise olives, pitted; -OR-
           - Gaeta or oil-cured
           - Black olives, pitted
 
  PEEL THE POTATOES AND SLICE them lengthwise into quarters or, if
  large, into 6ths. Trim the fennel, remove the outer leaves if they're
  scarred, and cut into wedges 1/2-inch thick or a little wider. Leave
  some of the core so that the pieces stay intact. Cut the tomatoes
  into large, neat pieces. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt to
  taste and the potatoes, and boil for 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes,
  but save the water. While the potatoes are cooking, warm the olive
  oil in a wide pan. When hot, add the leek, onion, garlic, herbs, a
  little salt, saffron, orange zest and bay leaves. Cook slowly over
  medium heat until the onions have begun to soften, after 6 or 7
  minutes, then add the wine. Let it reduce by approximately half, then
  add the tomatoes and their juice, the potatoes, fennel, half the
  parsley and the olives. Pour in enough of the reserved potato water
  to cover, bring to a boil and lower the heat. At this point, you can
  set the stew aside and finish it later, either in the oven or on top
  of the stove. If cooking on top of the stove, cover the pan and cook
  slowly until the vegetables are tender, about 35 minutes. If cooking
  in the oven, preheat it to 375F, cover loosely and bake for about 1
  hour, or until done. Remove bay leaves. Garnish with the remaining
  parsley and serve with a bowl of garlic mayonnaise.

      Title: TOMATO JUICE
 Categories: Beverages, Canning
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  Quantity: An average of 23 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
  quarts, or an average of 14 pounds per canner load of 9 pints. A
  bushel weighs 53 pounds and yields 15 to 18 quarts of juice--an
  average of 3-1/4 pounds per quart.
  
  Procedure: Wash, remove stems, and trim off bruised or discolored
  portions. To prevent juice from separating, quickly cut about 1 pound
  of fruit into quarters and put directly into saucepan. Heat
  immediately to boiling while crushing. Continue to slowly add and
  crush freshly cut tomato quarters to the boiling mixture. Make sure
  the mixture boils constantly and vigorously while you add the
  remaining tomatoes. Simmer 5 minutes after you add all pieces. If you
  are not concerned about juice separation, simply slice or quarter
  tomatoes into a large saucepan. Crush, heat, and simmer for 5 minutes
  before juicing.
  
  Press both types of heated juice through a sieve or food mill to
  remove skins and seeds. Add bottled lemon juice or citric acid to
  jars (See acidification instructions). Heat juice again to boiling.
  Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the jars, if desired. Fill jars
  with hot tomato juice, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and
  process following to the instructions in Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3
  according to the method of canning used.

      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 lb Ripe (about 5 or 6 medium)
           -tomatos, rinsed and diced
      2 lg Garlic cloves, smashed
    1/2 sm Onion, diced
    1/4 lg (1-ounce) red bell pepper,

           -vinegar
      1 tb Salt
      2 ts Pickling spices
    1/4 c  Tomato paste
 
  Info:  from "Eat More, Weigh Less", by Dean Ornish M.D., 1993 Harper
  Collins recipe by Wolfgang Puck typed for you by Perry Lowell,
  GOURMET, July '93 The length of time it takes for the ketchup to
  thicken depends on the water content of the tomatos, so be patient.
  Make only with vine-ripened tomatos.
  
  Makes 2 cups.
  
  In a medium stainless-steep or enamel saucepan, over a low flame,
  cook the tomatos and garlic until the sauce begins to bubble. Add the
  onion and red pepper and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the corn syrup,
  vinegar, salt, and pickling spices and continue to simmer over the
  low flame until the sauce reduces and thickens, about 1-1/2 hours,
  stirring occasionally. (The sauce will reduce by about one-half.)  Do
  not rush.  Cook over a low flame to prevent scorching.
  
  Strain through a food mill and stir in the tomato paste. Correct
  seasoning to taste, cool, and refrigerate in a covered container
  until needed. The ketchup will thicken slightly as it cools, but it
  is not the consistency of store-bought ketchup.  The ketchup will
  keep up to three weeks.

      Title: TOMATO LENTIL STEW OVER QUINOA
 Categories: Stews, Low fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        2 c  lentils  -- washed
        2 lg onions
        5 md tomatoes
        3 TB canola oil
  :          water
      3/4 ts salt
    1 1/2 ts marjoram
    1 1/2 ts savory
  
  In a medium-large saucepan boil lentils in water for about 30 - 40
  minutes (or until thoroughly cooked). While these are cooking, chop
  onions and tomatoes.  In a very large skillet or pan, sautee onions
  until they are just about cooked (mostly translucent).  Add tomatoes
  and stir occasionally.  Crush the marjoram and savory in your palm
  and rub together to release the flavor, and add to the pan. Add the
  salt. When it seems the tomatoes are fairly stewy and cooked, add the
  cooked, well drained lentils (which by this time should be done).
  Cook together for a few minutes to get an even mixture. To cook
  quinoa, boil two parts water to one part quinoa. Add grain
  (supposedly you're supposed to rinse it, but I don't have a fine
  enough colander, so I do without this step).  Cover and lower to a
  simmer. Cook for 15 minutes.  Stir and let sit covered off the heat
  for ten minutes before serving. This is a really good dish with
  steamed cauliflower and for a really neat touch, try adding some
  cooked arame seaweed on top. Soak a handful of arame in cold water
  (you don't need very much of this ~ a little goes a LONG way, and
  it's very very dense in nutrition). In a small pan heat some oil and
  add a couple cloves of chopped or pressed garlic, and a very small
  amount of diced ginger (optional). Add drained and squeezed arame and
  sautee for a few minutes. Add soy sauce to taste. When the arame
  becomes crispy it's ready to eat. Just sprinkle on top of the stew,
  or any pasta dish for that matter.

 Categories: Relishes, Jams, Preserves
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Very ripe, sweet tomatoes
      2 lb Sugar
      1    Vanilla bean
     10 oz Water
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman TOMATO PRESERVES In a wide
  preserving pan boil the sugar and water to a syrup. Add the tomatoes,
  skinned and sliced. Boil steadily, stirring fairly often, for about 35
  minutes. Put in the vanilla bean (vanilla essence will not do). Cook
  for approximately 10-15 minutes longer, or until setting point is
  reached. Remove the vanilla pod, skim the jam, and let it cool for a
  few minutes before turning it into small jars.
  
  The cookbook says this is "particularly good when eaten in the French
  way, as a sweet, with fresh cream cheese or plain pouring cream."

      Title: TOMATO SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg Can tomatoes (cheapest is
           Best here, since they're
           Soupy to start with)
      2    Dead-ripe, peeled, fresh
           Tomatoes (optional - if
           They're in season, else
           Don't bother)
      1    Onion, chopped
      2 cl Garlic, minced
      1 sm Bell pepper, red or green
           (optional - only if you
           Like it)
    1/4 c  Best olive oil
      8 oz Contadina tomato sauce
      6 oz Can Contadina tomato paste
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Dried oregano
           Minced fresh basil, to
           Taste (hard to have too
           Much basil)
 
  Heat the olive oil in a large pot, and saute the onions and green
  pepper until soft.  Add the garlic and saute another minute or two.
  Coarsely chop the fresh tomatoes, add them to the pot and cook,
  stirring, until they begin to give up their juice. Coarsely chop the
  canned tomatoes and add them, along with the tomato sauce and tomato
  past. Stir in the seasonings, cover the pot and simmer the sauce over
  low heat 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  The Contadina tomato sauce and paste have significantly better flavor
  than any others I know of. If you can't get Contadina, then a small
  shake of tobasco will help (not enough to make it hot, just enough to
  give it a little sparkle).
  
  For all those people who THINK they can't make a pie crust, here is a
  quick, easy, and CHEAP pie crust recipe. I think the trick is the
  boiling water and fluffing the shortening with a fork so that it
  disperses evenly throughout the flour.

      2 ts Olive oil, cold pressed
    1/2    Onion; finely chopped
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Marjoram
      2 lg Garlic cloves; chopped

     28 oz Tomatoes, canned or fresh;
           -chopped
      1 c  ;water
           Salt and pepper
 
  1. Place the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion, basil, oregano,
  and marjoram and cook, covered, over medium heat until the onion is
  golden. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Remove the onion
  and garlic and reserve. 2. Place the tomato paste in the same
  saucepan and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
  
  3. Add the canned tomatoes and mash wiht a fork or potato masher. If
  you prefer a creamier sauce, blend the tomatoes in a blender until
  smooth. Add the water and bring to a fast boil.
  
  4. Reduce the heat. Add the reserved onion, garlic, salt and pepper.
  Simmer, covered, for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
  
  Note: for a thick sauce (if sauce is to be used for pizza), cook,
  uncovered, during the last half hour, stirring often to prevent
  burning.

      Title: TOMATO SAUCE WITH ORANGE & BASIL
 Categories: Fruits, Seasonings, Italian, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 lb Italian plum tomatoes
           -- cored & coarsely chopped
      2 tb Fruity olive oil
      2    Garlic cloves
           -- minced or pressed
      1 c  Carrot; shredded
    1/2 c  Onion; chopped
      1 tb + 2 tsp. grated orange peel
           -- (colored part only)
    1/4 c  Fresh basil; chopped
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  Saute garlic in olive oil for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add carrots and onion
  and saute until soft and tender. Add tomatoes, cover, and simmer (do
  not boil) for 20 minutes. Uncover, add orange peel and basil, and
  simmer another 20 minutes.
  
  At this point, sauce can be processed through a food mill for a
  smooth, creamy texture or left as is for a more robust sauce. In
  either case, cook another 10 to 15 minutes until sauce is thickened,
  adding salt and pepper.
  
  The editors wrote: "The appeal of this sauce lay in its freshness,
  simplicity and secret ingredient - orange peel. Michael serves it over
  fish, meat or vegetables, as well as angel-hair pasta."

      Title: TOMATO VEGETABLE SOUP
 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lg Cans Italian Style tomatoes
      5    Celery, chopped fine
      2 md Onions chopped fine
      6 c  Water - 8 c water
           Vegetables of choice
 
  Boil the above on high for at least 10 minutes.  You can chop the
  tomatoes in the blender, or break them up with a spoon. I like to
  squish them in my hands. gets out frustration. (i usually put the
  seasoning in at this point. see below)
  
  Add pre-cooked beans (whatever you think will taste good) to the above
  mixture. you can use canned, but I like the dried beans better. I
  prefer a nine-bean soup variety that's locally available. Not sure if
  it's available everywhere.
  
  Add vegetables to the above according to your tastes. Be sure to add
  them according to cooking time.  No set amounts. Add them and stir.
  If it looks good, go with it. If it looks like it needs more, toss
  some more in.
  
  I use:
  
  Potatoes, cubed (makes the base nice and thick) corn zucchini summer
  squash (go easy...add it late or it'll take over...i don't use it if
  i'm making it for just us cause there's always leftovers and the
  cabbage flavor gets stronger the longer it sits.) cabbage
  
  you'd think carrots would taste good, but their flavor took over and
  it was barely palatable.  could just be my taste, though. same with
  broccoli and cauliflower.
  
  I season it with Oregano and Black pepper, and occasionally garlic,
  but go easy with this. could make it taste bitter.
  
  We used to sprinkle parmesan cheese on it and serve with crusty
  bread. now we don't use the parmesan, but i've been known to sprinkle
  nutritional yeast on the top.
  
  note:  if the soup gets thicker than you want it, add water, but add
  it slowly. it'll thin out, and so will the flavor. If you do add
  water toward the end, be sure to let it stew for a while longer.

      Title: TOMATO VEGETABLE SOUP (GIBAS)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text free-form recipe
 
  3 oz. sun dried tomatoes 5+ large cloves of garlic (the more the
  better) a handful of fresh basil leaves or 1T. dried basil
  
  simmer this until the tomatoes are soft and the garlic is cooked
  through. Puree, adding enough of the cooking water to make the
  blender run smoothly.
  
  Add: several (I used 5) large tomatoes (about 5 cups, chopped). Peel
  and seed if you are inspired to do so.
        2    smallish zucchini, sliced.
  
  Simmer until the tomatoes have become soup and the zucchini is almost
  tender. Stir occasionally.
  
  Add: 8 oz. mushrooms, sliced.
  
  While the mushrooms are being absorbed into the soup, cook some small
  pasta. I used 'mostacciolini'. When the pasta is done, put some in a
  bowl and cover with soup.
  
  If you add lots of spinach, instead of zucchini and mushrooms, this
  becomes 'tomato Florentine soup'. Orzo or rice is a good addition in
  that case, instead of the pasta.

      Title: TOMATO-BASIL SOUP
 Categories: Appetizers, Soups, Vegetables, Kooknet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Tomatoes; diced
      2    Cloves Garlic; coarsely
           -chopped
      2 tb Olive Oil
    1/4 c  Dry Red Wine
      5 c  Vegetable Stock
      1 cn Tomato Paste
      2 bn Basil; coarsely chopped
           Salt
           Ground Black Pepper
 
  Dice the tomatoes into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.
  
  Heat olive oil until it is warmed.  Add the garlic & saute it very
  gently only until it becomes fragrant. Add the tomatoes, stir once &
  add the remaining ingredients except the basil & salt & pepper. Raise
  the heat a little, cover & let the soup cook gently without ever
  letting it quite come to the boil.  Let it cook like this for 45
  minutes. You want the tomatoes to be softened.  Add the seasonings &
  the basil. Cook long enough to warm the basil through. Serve with
  freshly baked, crusty, Italian bread.
  
  MARK'S NOTE: If you want a thin soup, omit the tomato paste. If you
  want it to be thicker, add the paste, but it will make quite a
  difference to the texture of the soup. If serving as a lunch, or with
  only a light main course, then the paste makes this a rich &
  satisfying soup: if serving purely as an appetizer, then omit the
  tomato paste.
  
  Also, do not let the soup come to a full rolling boil. It is best
  served warmed.  Once you add the basil, you may want to switch the
  heat off & let the soup sit for a while, reheating just before
  serving.

      Title: TOMATO-TOFU OVER RICE (OR PASTA)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     10    Ripe roma tomatoes
      1 lg Onion
      1    Several cloves of garlic (we
           Like lots)
      1    Red bell pepper (optional)
    1/2    Block low fat tofu
 
  Saute the onions and garlic in water or white wine, deglazing them a
  couple of times.  Meanwhile cut up the tomatoes and rinse and cut up
  the tofu (I love the White Wave version, since it's firm enough not
  to fall apart when stirred).  Add the tomatoes and tofu and cook
  until the tomatoes are nearly ready and add the red pepper. The
  pepper should be barely cooked.
  
  We serve this over Japanese rice cooked in a rice cooker, but other
  rices and pasta are also good.  If we want more sauce or the tomatoes
  aren't exquisite, we sometimes stir in some pasta sauce along with
  the tomatoes.

 Categories: Vegetables, Canning
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  Quantity: An average of 12 pounds of tomatoes and 4 pounds of okra or
  zucchini is needed per canner load of 7 quarts. An average of 7
  pounds of tomatoes and 2-1/2 pounds of okra or zucchini is needed per
  canner load of 9 pints.
  
  Procedure: Wash tomatoes and okra or zucchini. Dip tomatoes in boiling
  water 30 to 60 seconds or until skins split. Then dip in cold water,
  slip off skins and remove cores, and quarter. Trim stems from okra
  and slice into 1-inch pieces or leave whole. Slice or cube zucchini
  if used. Bring tomatoes to a boil and simmer 10 minutes. Add okra or
  zucchini and boil gently 5 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of salt for each
  quart to the jars, if desired. Fill jars with mixture, leaving 1-inch
  headspace. Adjust lids and process according to the recommendations
  in Table 1 or Table 2, depending on the method of canning used.
  
  Variation: You may add four or five pearl onions or two onion slices
  to each jar.

      Title: TOMATOES~ INTRODUCTION
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  Quality: Select only disease-free, preferably vine-ripened, firm
  fruit for canning.
  
  Caution: Do not can tomatoes from dead or frost-killed vines. Green
  tomatoes are more acidic than ripened fruit and can be canned safely
  with any of the following recommendations.
  
  Acidification: To ensure safe acidity in whole, crushed, or juiced
  tomatoes, add two tablespoons of bottled lemon juice or 1/2 teaspoon
  of citric acid per quart of tomatoes. For pints, use one tablespoon
  bottled lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon citric acid. Acid can be added
  directly to the jars before filling with product. Add sugar to offset
  acid taste, if desired. Four tablespoons of a 5 percent acidity
  vinegar per quart may be used instead of lemon juice or citric acid.
  However, vinegar may cause undesirable flavor changes.
  
  Recommendation: Use of a pressure canner will result in higher
  quality and more nutritious canned tomato products. If your pressure
  canner cannot be operated above 15 PSI, select a process time at a
  lower pressure.

      1 lg Yellow onion
           - cut into wedges 1/2" thick
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 ts Herbes de Provence
      3 pn Saffron threads
      1 lg Strip orange zest (2" long)
      2    Bay leaves
      1 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Chopped parsley
     12    Nicoise olives, pitted; -OR-
           - Gaeta or oil-cured
           - Black olives, pitted
 
  PEEL THE POTATOES AND SLICE them lengthwise into quarters or, if
  large, into 6ths. Trim the fennel, remove the outer leaves if they're
  scarred, and cut into wedges 1/2-inch thick or a little wider. Leave
  some of the core so that the pieces stay intact. Cut the tomatoes
  into large, neat pieces. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt to
  taste and the potatoes, and boil for 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes,
  but save the water. While the potatoes are cooking, warm the olive
  oil in a wide pan. When hot, add the leek, onion, garlic, herbs, a
  little salt, saffron, orange zest and bay leaves. Cook slowly over
  medium heat until the onions have begun to soften, after 6 or 7
  minutes, then add the wine. Let it reduce by approximately half, then
  add the tomatoes and their juice, the potatoes, fennel, half the
  parsley and the olives. Pour in enough of the reserved potato water
  to cover, bring to a boil and lower the heat. At this point, you can
  set the stew aside and finish it later, either in the oven or on top
  of the stove. If cooking on top of the stove, cover the pan and cook
  slowly until the vegetables are tender, about 35 minutes. If cooking
  in the oven, preheat it to 375F, cover loosely and bake for about 1
  hour, or until done. Remove bay leaves. Garnish with the remaining
  parsley and serve with a bowl of garlic mayonnaise.

      Title: TOO MUCH FRUIT SALAD
 Categories: Fruit
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1    Pineapple, ripe
      1    Melon, ripe
      1 lg Grapefruit
           -(preferably pink)
      3    Oranges
     11 oz Maraschino cherries
           -(1 large jar)
      3    Bananas, ripe
      3    Kiwi fruits
      1 lb Stewed prunes,
           -in heavy syrup
           -(1 standard can)
      3    Peaches, sliced
           -(or use 1 lb stewed
           -apricot halves in
           -heavy syrup)
      1 c  Apricot nectar
 
  Peel and section the grapefruit and oranges.  Remove the seeds and
  membranes. Cut the sections into bite-size pieces and dump into a big
  non-metallic bowl.
  
  Peel and core the pineapple (making sure to get all the eyes), cut the
  flesh into bite-sized pieces and add to the bowl. A typical whole
  pineapple is usually too much, so you might want to reserve about 1/3
  of the flesh to eat by itself.
  
  Peel and cut the melon, bananas, peaches and kiwi fruits and add to
  the bowl. The kiwis should be sliced horizontally (so the seeds make
  pretty circular patterns).
  
  Add the stewed prunes, syrup and all.  This will moisten everything.
  Add the maraschino cherries and the syrup they came in (check for
  stems). Add the nectar, making sure there is enough liquid to cover
  the fruit.
  
  This is the hard part.  Put it all in the refrigerator, and don't eat
  any until tomorrow.  It really needs to sit overnight for all the
  colors and flavors to blend together.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Many people think of fruit salad as that disgusting stuff that
  comes in a can made from diced plastic fruit and heavy syrup. This is
  more like what it is supposed to taste like, although some people
  might claim that my addition of syrup makes this into fruit cocktail
  instead of fruit salad.
  
  Whatever you call it, it's especially good in the summer. I make it
  every couple of months (usually in vast quantities, even though there
  are only two of us, hence the name). It rarely lasts very long,
  regardless of how much I make. Yield: Makes too much.
  
  *  Some people might object to the use of maraschino cherries, they
  are processed with sulfur dioxide, which isn't really good for you. I
  like the way they taste, so I allow myself this one debauch.
  
  *  Unless you can find good-quality fresh fruit, it is better to use
  canned. This is especially true of pineapple, canned pineapple is not
  as good as good fresh pineapple, but is much better than a bad fresh
  one. For the melon, I've used honeydew, cantaloupe and casaba with
  good results. Watermelon is interesting, but has a very different
  texture from the others. More important than the actual variety is
  that it is ripe. Unfortunately, New York supermarkets only seem to
  sell the kind of melon that goes from rock-hard to rotten without
  passing through ripe. Bananas are best when they are just starting to
  get brown speckles.
  
  *  My mother uses orange juice for the liquid, but I prefer nectar.
  The combination of the prune and cherry syrups give it a nice color.
  Sometimes I add a bit of lemon juice for tartness. I've experimented
  with cherry liqueur, but didn't really like the results.
  
  *  Use whatever fruit you find fresh in the market. The invariant
  part is the grapefruit, orange and maraschino cherries.

      2 lb Top round beef steak, cut
           ÿ1 inch thick
  1 1/2 tb Crushed black (Java) pepper
      1 tb Butter
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
      1 tb Vegetable oil
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
      2 tb Cognac
    1/2 c  Heavy cream (optional)
      2 tb Fresh chopped parsley
           ÿSalt
           Parsley sprigs
 
  This is SOOOO good.  I make it without the sour cream and it is SOOOO
  good without the sour cream that it is probably devine with it.
  Warning: once you start cooking this, you should have your
  accompaniments ready; the cooking goes pretty fast.  I heat up a
  toaster oven first and when the time comes to keep the steak warm, I
  turn OFF the toaster oven and pop the steak in (it JUST fits).
  Combine crushed pepper, butter, and garlic into a paste. Spread
  evenly on both sides of the steak. Heat oil in heavy frying pan over
  medium high heat.  When very hot, add steak and brown evenly on both
  sides. Allow 7 minutes per side for rare, 8 minutes for medium rare,
  and 9 minutes for medium. Place steak on a serving platter and keep
  warm. Deglaze the pan with the wine and cognac and cook 1 minute.
  Reduce heat, add cream and chopped parsley and continue cooking 1-2
  minutes, stirring constantly. Season to taste with salt. Carve steak
  diagonally across the grain into thin slices.  Pour the sauce over
  steak and garnish with parsley.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour; sift on pastry board
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2    Egg yolks
      1 c  Butter; softened
      2 ts Lemon rind; grated
  1 1/2 c  Cottage cheese; sieved
      4    Egg yolks
      2 ts Lemon rind; grated
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Flour
      4    Egg whites
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Almonds; slivered/blanched
 
   Make a well in the center of the flour and put into it the next four
  ingredients.  Quickly work these ingredients into the flour to make a
  smooth dough, adding a bit more flour if needed, to facilitate
  handling. On a floured board, roll out the dough into a 11X17"
  rectangle. Line a baking sheet with the dough and bake it in a
  moderate oven (350 degrees F>), for about 15 minutes, or until it is
  about half done. Let it cool.
   Add the 4  egg yolks and lemon rind to the cottage cheese. Beat the
  egg whites until very stiff, gradually adding the sugar, beginning
  when they have slightly stiffened. Fold the beaten egg whites into
  the cheese and spread the cooled pastry shell with the cheese
  filling. Sprinkle the cake with the raisins and almonds.
   Bake in a very slow oven (250 degrees F.) about 45 minutes. Let cool
  and cut into large squares.

 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Ethnic
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Chick peas
      6 c  -Cold water
      2 sm Potatoes; boiled in jackets
  1 1/2 ts Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      3 lg Onions; halved & sliced
      2 tb -Water
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
    1/3 c  Pine nuts
    1/3 c  Currants
    3/4 c  Tahina
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper

MMMMM--------------------TO FINISH AND SERVE-------------------------
           -Boiling, salted water
           Olive oil
           Ground cinnamon or paprika
           Lemon wedges
           Parsley sprigs
 
  Serves: 8-12 Cooking time: 35 minutes
  
  Soak chick peas in the cold water for 24 hours, in a cool place if
  weather is warm.  Remove the skins by taking a handful at a time and
  rubbing with the palms of both hands so that the chick peas actually
  rub against one another.  Drop back into bowl and take up another
  lot. Skim off the floating skins as they accumulate. (Dang, why not
  just leave the skins ON, this sounds like too much trouble! -KM)
  Drain well.
  
  Pass the skinned chick peas through food grinder twice, using fine
  screen. Alternatively, place in food processor container in 2 lots
  and process to a paste (NOW you're talking! -KM)
  
  Peel skin from boiled potatoes and mash finely with a fork. Combine
  with ground chick peas, add salt and a good grinding of white pepper.
  Blend thoroughly and keep aside.
  
  Put sliced onions in a pan with the water, cover and steam over
  medium heat for 10 minutes, then remove cover and leave until
  moisture evaporates. Turn into a bowl and cool.
  
  Add allspice, cumin, pine nuts, and currants to the onion. Blend
  well, then mix in tahina, and salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Take 4 pieces of unbleached calico or similar cloth, each about 50 cm
  (20 inches) square and scald in boiling water. Cool a little, then
  wring out well.
  
  Open out a square of cloth on work surface and put a quarter of the
  chick pea paste in the centre.  Spread evenly with a spatula to a 20
  cm (8 inch) square and place a quarter of the filling in the centre,
  spreading it a little.
  
  Bring each corner of the paste over the filling by lifting up corners
  of cloth.  Paste should enclose filling in envelope fashion. Smooth
  joins to seal well.
  
  Make a single tie with each pair of diagonally opposite corners of
  cloth, then tie a second time. Complete another 3 topigs in the same
  way.
  
  Half fill a large pot with water, bring to the boil and add about 1
  tablespoon salt. When briskly boiling, lower prepared topigs into pot
  and return to the boil. Cover and boil steadily for 12-15 minutes or
  until topigs float and feel firm to the touch.
  
  Lift out immediately and place on a tray, draining off water in tray.
  
  Untie and invert topigs onto platter.  Leave until cool.
  
  When ready to serve, pour a little olive oil over each topig and dust
  lightly with cinnamon or paprika. Garnish platter with lemon wedges
  and parsley.  To serve, cut each topig in half, then slice in thick
  pieces. Olive oil and lemon juice are added to individual taste.
  
  NOTE: Ready-skinned chick peas are available at some Armenian and
  Greek food stores.  These look like split peas, but are larger and
  nut coloured.

      1 tb Melted butter
      1 tb Corn syrup
    1/4 c  Pecan or walnut halves
           Crust for 2 crust pie
           Filling for pie:
    2/3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Flour
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      4 c  Sliced apples
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
 
  1.  In a 9" pie pan, combine brown sugar, corn syrup and melted butter
      and spread evenly over the bottom of the pan. Arrange pecan or
      walnut halves over the mixture. Set aside. 2. Make your favorite
  pie crust. Take the bottom crust and put it
      over the mixture in the pie pan. Heat oven to 425F. 3. In a small
  bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, nutmeg, flour
      and cinnamon; mix well. Arrange the apple/sugar mixture over the
      bottom crust of the pie. Top with the top crust. Seal and flute.
      Cut slits in several places. 4. Bake at 425F for 8 minutes, and
  then reduce heat and continue to
      bake at 375F for 25-35 minutes, or until golden brown. It would
      be wise to place pie on cookie sheet covered with foil, as it
      will run over. 5. While pie is baking, prepare a glaze of 1/2 c
  confectioners sugar,
      1 tsp vanilla, and enough milk to make into a glaze. This will be
      used on the top of the pie when removed from the oven and still
      hot. 6. Remove pie from oven; loosen edge of pie. Cover top of
  pie with
      glaze. While still hot, carefully invert pie onto large serving
      plate. Serve warm or cold with whipped cream or ice cream.

 Categories: Norwegian, Seafood, Cheese/eggs, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Salt
      6    Codfish steaks; fresh,

MMMMM-------------------------EGG SAUCE------------------------------
    1/4 lb Butter

MMMMM---------------------ALTERNATE GARNISH--------------------------
      8 tb Butter; melted
      1    Lemon; thinly sliced
           Parsley sprigs
 
  If you don't have a long, narrow fish poacher, an enamel roasting pan
  5" deep will do just as well. Fill the pan with water to a depth of
  4" and add 1/2 cup salt. Bring to a boil (over two burners, if
  necessary), reduce heat slightly and gently slide the cod slices into
  the water with a spatula. Lower the heat until water is bubbling
  slightly and simmer for about 5 minutes. Be careful not to overcook
  or the fish will disintegrate. Remove the slices with a slotted
  spatula and drain them on a linen napkin or dish towel. Reserve stock
  for use in the egg sauce. Arrange cod attractively on a heated
  platter and serve with egg sauce. EGG SAUCE: Melt the butter in a
  saucepan. Remove from the heat, beat in 1/4 cup of the stock in which
  you poached the fish and stir in chopped egg, tomato, parsley and
  chives. Add salt and pepper to taste. Heat almost to the boiling
  point, pour into a sauceboat and serve with the cod. If you prefer,
  you can simply pour melted butter over the cod and garnish with lemon
  slices and parsley. In Norway, this dish is often accompanied by raw
  diced carrots, sprinkled with lemon juice and new potatoes (see

       12    corn tortillas
        3    eggs -- beaten
      3/4 lb asadero cheese

  :          grated
  :          Shredded lettuce and chopped
  :          tomato for
  :          garnish
  
  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat a skillet over medium-high to
  high heat, add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, and saute the chicken
  until it is turning golden brown on both sides. Turn the heat to low,
  add the wine, cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through,
  about 3 to 5 minutes or more, depending on the thickness of the
  chicken. Remove the pan from the heat and when the chicken is cool
  enough to handle, shred it, reserving the pan juices.
  
  Heat a saucepan over medium heat, add the remaining 3 tablespoons
  olive oil, and saute the onions until they are just golden brown,
  being careful not to scorch them. Add the garlic and continue cooking
  for 1 minute. Add the chiles, reserved pan juices from the chicken,
  and the tomatoes. Cook until the chiles are soft and the sauce has
  begun to thicken, about 5 minutes or more depending on the water
  content of the tomatoes. Then, add the salt, remove the pan from the
  heat, and stir in the shredded chicken.
  
  Pour 1/2 inch cooking oil into a skillet just large enough to
  accommodate the tortillas. Heat the oil until a drop of water
  sputters immediately One at a time, using kitchen tongs, dip the
  tortillas into the beaten egg, drain well, and fry to soften the
  tortillas and cook the egg, turning once. This should take just a be
  seconds on each side. The tortillas will be very soft so be careful
  not to tear them. Drain the fried tortillas on absorbent towels.
  
  To assemble the tortas, place one cooked tortilla on each of 4
  ovenproof serving plates.  Top each tortilla with a little of the
  chicken /vegetable filling, then sprinkle on some cheese. Add the
  second and third tortilla and fillings in the same manner so that the
  third tortilla is topped with the remaining chicken/vegetable filling
  and cheese. Bake the tortas until the cheese is melted and turning
  golden on the top, about 8 minutes. Serve garnished with shredded
  lettuce and chopped tomato. Typos by Brenda Adams <adamsfmle@aol.com>

           Typed by Manny Rothstein
 
  (This recipe is from Dal Pescatore, just north of Parma,
  Italy,"considered by many to be the best restaurant in the entire
  country" sez the Times, so it must be true.)MR
  
    This filling takes some adjusting to resemble the stuff the Santinis
  brought from home. Their Mostarda, which they make themselves every
  year, had a mustard-y bite that nearly brought tears to our eyes. The
  stuff we bought here, in an Italian specialty store, was much
  sweeter, so we added a bit of dried mustard to crank up the heat.
  Also, since we could find neither yellow pumpkin nor Hubbbard squash
  on the day we shopped for testing materials, we used acorn squash. It
  worked fairly well but required some additional bread crumbs to
  become firm enough to hold together properly. When it's done, the
  flavors are explosive and almost medieval, combining sweet squash
  with mustard-y hot mostarda and rich cheese and butter.
    Prepare filling up to 2 days in advance, but definitely before
  pasta is rolled out. Cut pumpkin or squash in sections, remove seeds.
  In pan bake at 350 degrees until tender. Pass through food mill into
  large bowl. Add Mostarda, amaretti, 2 tb cheese and dash of ground
  nutmeg. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix well and taste.
  Filling should have definite mustard-heat. If not, add up to 1 ts
  dried mustard. Filling should also be fairly firm and loosly hold
  together when formed in ball. If not, add up to 2 tb bread crumbs.
    In bowl mix flour and eggs. Knead into smooth ball and wrap in
  plastic wrap. Set aside at least 1/2 hour. Devide in quarters and
  work with 1 portion at a time, keeping rest tightly wrapped in
  plastic wrap. Knead and roll out on pasta machine to next-to-thinnest
  setting. Cut into long strip and cut strip at 2-inch intervals into
  squares.
    Place ball of stuffing slightly smaller than walnut in center of
  each rectangle. Diagonally fold over 1 corner of rectangle to meet
  opposite corner. Press to seal. Fold base of triangle over to form
  "paper hat" shape and prell sides to seal. Set aside on floured
  kitchen towel and repeat until all dough is used up.
    Sprinkle heated serving dish with 1 1/2 tb cheese. Melt butter in
  saucepan. Cook tortelli in abundant boiling, salted water 4 to 5
  minutes, until pasta is cooked. Remove with slotted spoon, working
  carefully to avoid breaking pasta. Place tortelli over cheese in
  serving dish. Sprinkle with another 1 1/2 tb cheese. Pour melted
  butter over. Toss gently. Makes 8 servings.

  (MR notes: Ratio of egg to flour may need to be juggled to get right
  texture, depending on flour used. If filling needs more heat, consider
  using Japanese horseradish.) L A Times, 3/17/94.

      Title: TORTELLINI ALLA PANNA
 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Of cream (heavy or light)
 
  Tortellini alla panna
  
  Tortellini alla panna is a basic of Northern and Central Italian
  cuisine.
  
  Tortellini (usually with a cured ham filling, but spinach or other
  fillings can go well too. Just don't use those dry tortellini packets
  you find on the shelf; choose fresh tortellini, or those you find in
  the refrigerated section of the store)
  
  Grated parmesan (enough to make cream thick) Salt Ham, cubed Butter or
  Margarine
  
  While you cook the tortellini, mix cream, Parmesan, and salt. Set
  aside. When they are almost cooked, melt a little butter or margarine
  in a small pan and saute the cubed ham until slighly red, stirring to
  keep it from sticking. When tortellini are ready, drain, and mix with
  cream mixture. Pour the contents of the ham pan over the tortellini,
  and mix. If desired, add some pepper.
  
  NOTES: 1. Add some salt to the water you use to cook the tortellini
  in. 2. Freshly grated Parmesan would be preferred. 3. Some people
  like to add some cooked green peas 4. The ratio of cream mixture,
  ham, and tortellini is up to the cook: some like lots of sauce, some
  just a little...
  
  This recipe is used also for tortelloni and ravioli...

 Categories: Spain, Eggs
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 kg Potatoes (2 pounds)
      3 tb Chopped onion (optional)
      1 c  Olive oil
      4    Eggs
    1/2 t  Salt
 
  Peel the potatoes and either cut them in dice or into thin slices.
  Heat the oil in the frying pan until very hot and add the potatoes,
  and onions, if desired. Stir them into the oil to completely coat and
  seal them, then reduce the heat slightly and continue frying without
  letting the potatoes brown, stirring them frequently. With the edge
  of a metal spatula or skimmer, keep cutting into the potatoes, dicing
  them as they cook. When they are quite tender (about 20 minutes)place
  a plate over the frying pan and drain off the oil into a heatproof
  container. Place the potatoes in a bowl. Beat together the eggs and
  salt until very well combined and stir the eggs into the potatoes and
  mix well. Return the oil to the frying pan and let it reheat. Now
  pour in the egg and potato mixture. Let it set on the bottom,
  regulating the heat so it doesn't brown too fast. (Best in non-stick
  pan) Use the spatula to firm the edges of the tortilla all around its
  circumference. Shake the pan frequently to keep it loose on the
  bottom. Place the plate over the pan, drain off the oil and turn the
  tortilla out onto the plate. Return the oil to the pan and slide the
  tortilla back in to cook on the reverse side. Remove the tortilla
  when it is golden by sliding out onto serving plate.

  Leaving the skins on, slice the new potatoes thinly. Peel, split, and
  slice onions. In a large saute pan, heat olive oil (the best you can
  afford). You need a good quarter inch in your pan. Saute potatoes and
  onions and garlic on a low flame until the potatoes are soft and the
  onions are translucent. Remove with a slotted spoon and place the
  potato mxture in a greased round cake pan, spring form pan, cast iron
  skillet or terra-cotta baking dish. If you use something small, make
  two. Season eggs and pour over potatoes. Bake 20 minutes at 350F and
  then start testing. When the middle is set and the top slightly
  brown, it's done. Let set 5 minutes, run a knife around the outside
  and invert onto a round platter. Serve at room temperature.

      Title: TORTILLA ESPANOLA (SPANISH OMELET)
 Categories: Eggs, Spanish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 tb Olive oil
      2 lg Onions; peeled & cut
           -into thin slices
      2 lb Potatoes, peeled & cut
           -into thin slices
      6    Eggs
           Salt; to taste
           Pepper; to taste
 
  Heat the oil in a large nonstick frying pan.  Saute the onions over
  medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes or until soft but not brown. Drain the
  onions in a colander, reserving 2 tablespoons of the oil from the pan.
  
  Cook the potatoes in boiling water for 4 to 5 minutes and drain in the
  colander.  Beat the eggs in a large bowl and stir in the onions and
  potatoes; add salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Heat the reserved oil over high heat in a heavy nonstick pan or a
  well- seasoned cast iron skillet. Add the egg mixture and cook for 2
  minutes or until the bottom is lightly browned. Place the pan in a
  preheated 400-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the egg
  mixture is set. Invert the tortilla onto a round platter. Cut into
  wedge-shaped slices and serve with a salad.
  
  NOTE:  In Spain, a tortilla isn't the cornmeal flat bread we think
  of, but a sort of omelet loaded with onions and peppers. This is a
  popular item at tapas bars, and an easy dinner to make after an
  evening of celebrating.

 Categories: Appetizers, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
   Tortillas are very versatile and can be used instead of puff pastry
  to make appetizers, sandwiches, snacks or desserts. The filling can
  be as varied as your imagination using any thing from leftovers to
  special made fillings.
   Simply take a flour tortilla and mix up a paste of 1 teaspoon corn
  flour and 1/2 teaspoon water and spread it around the edge of the
  tortilla. Place the filling in the middle and seal the edges by
  pressing them together where you spread the corn flour mixture.
   Place oil in a skillet and heat it until it is hot. Fry tortilla on
  both sides until golden brown. Place on a plate with a paper towel
  and blot off any excess oil.
   Enjoy!

  Soften cream cheese, drain can of chilies, set out other ingredients.
  Place cream cheese, milk, garlic, onion flakes, and salt in bowl.
  Beat until fluffy. Stir in chilies and cilantro leaves. Brush both
  sides of a tortilla with water.  Spread one side of torilla with thin
  layer of the cream cheese mixture.  Cover torilla with a layer of the
  sliced meat. Roll up and place on plate, repeat.  Cover plate with
  plastic wrap and refrigerate from 1 to 8 hours.  Cut into 1/2-inch
  slices and serve. Makes about 4 dozen appetizers. * Pre-packaged
  "Buddig" style meats work well for everyday occasions. # Many
  supermarkets now carry small plastic containers of spices at one
    price.  I've found that 1 container of cilantro (.15 oz) is
    satisfactory for most occasions, even though less than 3
  Tablespoons.

  I also had tortilla soup at ChiChi's and they just used chicken in a
  broth with onions, and cubes of zucchini and different colors of
  squash. It was really tasty also.

 Categories: Mexican, Soup, Soups, Soups & ste
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1    Medium onions; sliced
      2    Cl Garlic; peeled
    1/2 cn Tomatoes (15-oz can)
  1 1/2 qt Chicken stock
           Salt
      6    Corn tortillas; stale
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      2    Chile ancho, dried; seeded a
      8 oz Muenster or monterey jack; c
      1    Lime; cut into 4-6 wedges
 
  Recipe by: Rick and Deann Bayless - Authentic Mexican Regional
  Preparation Time: 1:00 1. The broth flavoring. In a medium-size
  skillet, heat 1 tablespoon
      of vegetable oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and whole
      garlic cloves, and fry until both are a deep golden-brown,
      12 to 15 minutes.  Scoop into a blender, add the tomatoes and
      blend until smooth. 2. The broth. Stir the broth into the tomato
  mixture, partially
      cover and simmer for 1/2 hour over medium heat. Season with salt.
  3. The garnishing ingredients.  If the tortillas are fresh or moist,
      let them dry out for a few minutes in a single layer. Slice them
      in half, then slice the halves crosswise into 1/4 inch strips.
      Heat 1/3 cup vegetable oil in a medium-small skillet over
      medium-high.  When hot, add the tortilla strips and fry, turning
      frequently, until they are crisp.  Drain on paper towels. Cut
      the chiles into 1-inch squares and fry in the hot oil very
      briefly, about 3 or 4 seconds; immediately remove and drain, then
      place in a small serving bowl. 4. Assembling the soup. Just before
  serving, divide the cheese
      among 4 to 6 bowls, and top with the fried tortilla strips.
      Ladle on the hot soup and serve right away.  Pass the
      toasted chile separately, along with the lime.

      Title: TORTILLA SOUP-TEXAS HOME COOKING
 Categories: Soups, Stews
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 c  Unsalted chicken stock
      6    Roasted garlic cloves* mince
    1/2 c  Red-ripe tomatoes, chopped,
           Seeded or canned crushed
           Tomatoes
      1 md Onion, 1/2 chopped and
           1/2 sliced into thin rings
      1    Fresh jalapeno, sliced into
           Thin rings
      1    Chipotle chile (whole if
           Dried, or minced if canned
      1 ts Dried oregano, preferably
           Mexican
      2 c  Shredded cooked chicken or
           Turkey
           Juice of 1 lime
           Salt to taste
      4    Corn totillas, sliced, into
           Thin strips, toasted or
           Broiled until crisp.
           Chopped cilantro,
           Cubed avacado,
           Mexican Asadero cheese
           Crumbled or
           Monterey Jack cheese grated
           For garnish
 
  In a large, heavy saucepan, bring the stock to a boil. Reduce the
  heat, and simmer uncovered until the stock is reduced to
  approximately 6 cups.
  
  Add the garlic, the tomatoes, the chopped half of the onion, the
  jalapeno, the chipotle, and the oregano to the stock. Continue to
  simmer, uncovered over medium-low heat another 30 minutes. While the
  soup cooks, place the remaining onions (sliced) on a greased baking
  sheet, and broil them until they are softened and a little brown
  around the edges. Add the broiled onions, the chicken, and the lime
  juice to the soup, and continue simmering until the chicken is just
  heated through. If you have used a dried chipotle, remove the chile,
  and either mince it and return it to the pan or discard it, depending
  on how spicy you want the meal.
  
  To serve, place a small handful of totilla strips in each bowl, and
  pour the soup over. Pass the garnishes separately.
  
  *Roasted garlic: Place individual cloves with skins on, in a heavy
  skillet over low heat, and turn them until the skins darken on all
  sides and the cloves soften.
  
  NOTES: Tortilla soup originated in Mexico as a way to use old
  tortillas and leftover poultry, but it developed into one of the
  classics of the national cuisine. If you want the full flavor of the
  dish, don't skip the steps of roasting the garlic and broiling the
  onions. These actions add a smoky mellowness to the soup which you
  can enhance even more by using smoked poultry.

      Title: TORTILLAS DE HARINA DE TRIGO
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
    1/4 lb Lard or shortening (1/2 cup)
      1 lb Unbleached flour, sifted
      2 ts Salt
      1 c  Hot water
 
  Using the fingers, rub the fat well into the flour. Dissolve the salt
  in the water and add it to the flour mixture. Knead the dough wll for
  about 3 minutes. Set it aside, covered, for at least 2 hours. Do not
  refrigerate. Heat the griddle over a medium flame. Knead the dough
  again for a minute or so, then take a piece of the dough and roll it
  inot a ball about 1 and 1/2 inches in diameter.  Press the ball out
  evenly on a floured board or pastry cloth - you are trying to roll it
  out to a paper thin circle about 7 inches in diameter. With each
  press of the rolling pin turn the dough around slightly to keep it
  circular. Place the tortilla on the griddle - if it is the correct
  heat there should be a slight sizzling sound as the dough touches it.
  Leave it for 20 seconds, by which time bubbles will appear on the
  surface and the underside will be speckled with dark brown. (If it
  puffs up, press it back onto the griddle.) Turn the tortilla over and
  cook it for a slightly shorter time on the other side. Place the
  tortillas, one on top of the other in a polyethylene bag. They should
  be thin light and flexible. NOTES: The tortillas can be made several
  hours ahead of time and warmed for a few seconds, one at a time on a
  hot griddle. They can be stored for several days in the refrigerator
  or frozen as long as they are kept flat. There is no need to defrost
  them before reheating. Flour should be sifted an weighed if possible.
  Crisco works the best for thin tortillas. Weigh the fat at room
  temperature. Makes 24 6-inch tortillas. The Cuisines of Mexico Diana

    1/2 ts Black pepper; freshly ground
      6 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Sour cream
      2 tb Parsley; fresh, finely
           ;chopped
 
  With paper towels, pat the corn kernels completely dry.  In a heavy 8
  to 10 inch skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat until a light
  haze forms above it.  Drop in the corn and cook, stirring frequently,
  for 10 minutes, or until the corn is golden brown.  Drain the corn on
  a double thickness of paper towels.
  
  Make the pancake batter in a large bowl, beating the eggs until they
  are well combined and foamy, then beating in the flour, salt and
  pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a heavy 5 to 6 inch
  skillet or crepe pan set over moderate heat.  When the foam subsides,
  pour in 1/4 cup of the batter. As soon as the edges begin to set,
  sprinkle the tortilla with 2 tablespoons of corn.  Then with a fork,
  push the edges of the tortilla toward the center of the pan and tip
  it slightly to allow the uncooked batter to run out and cover the
  exposed areas of the pan. When the tortilla is set and the bottom a
  light brown, turn it over with a spatula and cook for 1 minute to
  brown to the other side.
  
  Slide the tortilla onto a heated platter and proceed similarly with
  the remaining batter, stirring the batter before making each
  tortilla. Add a teaspoon of the remaining butter to the pan for each
  one. As they are done, stack the pancakes one on top of each other.
  Serve them on individual plates, topped with a tablespoon of sour
  cream and sprinkling of chopped fresh parsley.

      Title: TORTILLAS DE MASA  (CORN TORTILLAS)
 Categories: Breads, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Masa Harina
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Margarine
  1 1/4 c  Warm water
 
  Mix masa harina and salt.  Add margarine. Add warm water all at once
  and use fingers to work mixture into a soft dough. Knead dough until
  no longer sticky. Divide dough into 12-16 balls; cover and let dough
  rest 20 minutes at room temperature.Place a small square of wax paper
  on the bottom part of open tortilla press. Place a ball almost on the
  center of the wax paper (a little more towares the hinge of the press
  than the handle). Place a second wax paper square, well flattened, on
  top of the ball. Close the press down firmly until the torilla
  measures about six inches in diameter. Peel the top wax paper off the
  dough. Pick up the second wax paper square and place the flattened
  dough onto the palm of your hand. Then peel off the wax paper and
  place the tortilla onto a moderately hot griddle. In a few seconds
  the edges of the tortilla will begin to dry out. At this point, turn
  the tortilla. Allow the second side to cook for a slightly longer
  period until it is slightly browned. Flip it back onto the first side
  and let it finish cooking. Allow 2 minutes cooking time per tortilla.
  Delicious served with any Mexican dish.  Serves 6-8.
  
  Notes:
  
  A tortilla press is a cast iron press for pressing corn tortillas and
  tamales into flat thin circles.  [One could probably use a (cold)
  round waffle iron, assuming that it has a flat (pancake) side in
  addition to the bumpy (waffle) side.]
  
  Masa is freshly ground daily at tortilla factories.  Corn is soaked
  in lime water and then cooked and rinsed before grinding.  Lime aids
  as a preservative and adds color.  Fresh masa is best for tamales and
  corn tortillas, but instant masa is also available.

    1/2 lb Pork - lean
    1/2 lb Beef - lean
    1/2 lb Veal
    1/2 lb Chicken
    1/4 lb Salt pork fat
           Salt
           Pepper
      1    Onion
  2 1/2 lb Potatoes
      1    Thick pie shell

MMMMM------------------------SUET PASTRY-----------------------------
    1/2 lb Suet, finely minced
      4 c  All purpose flour
      2 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/3 c  Water (approx)
 
  At night prepare the meat by cutting the pork, veal, beef, chicken
  and pork fat into small cubes. Season with salt, pepper and onion cut
  in rings. Cover and put in a cool, fresh place. The next morning, cut
  the potatoes in small cubes. Roll suet pastry into a 28xd4x1/2-inch
  strip. Cut lengthwise into halves. Line a 10-inch three-quart
  casserole (or two smaller casseroles) with one strip, bringing pastry
  over top edge. fill pastry with alternate layers of meat and potatoes
  until all ingredients are used. Cover all with boiling water and seal
  pie with top layer of pie shell. Cut hole in centre of pie shell to
  let steam escape. Cover casserole with foil. Bake in moderate oven
  (350F) for four hours. Remove the foil for the last 30 minutes of
  baking time to brown the crust. The original recipe of the Naskapis
  (native Indians of Quebec) called for one rabbit, a partridge, one
  pound of moose meat and one pound of lean pork instead of the more
  mundane meats used today. Variation: Minced meats may be used in lieu
  of cubes. Suet pastry: Mix suet with flour, baking powder and salt.
  Stir in enough water to moisten the flour. Gather dough together and
  shape into a ball.

  Split a good 3 1/2 or 4 ounce Filet Mignon in 2 medallions (disks) and
  broil or charbroil to desired degree. Place each half on crisply
  toasted english muffin. (I have used fried rounds of a good dense
  french bread) Cover it all with a generous portion of Bearnaise sauce
  and top with "crown" of tomato.
  
  To make the crown, hold the tomato on it's side and jab the point of a
  paring knife straight thru the tomato at a 45 degree angle to a line
  running from top to bottom. repeat all around till you get back to
  where you started. the tomato will fall apart. If not gently twist it
  to separate the halves.
  
   Your cut will look like this: /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
  
  DIp the cut side into any decent grated parmasean cheese and slip
  under the broiler for a few seconds to brown the cheese. Place the
  tomato on top of the filet and secure it with a toothpick.
  
  It's ready to serve.
  
  HOLLANDAISE SAUCE =================
  
  Separate 6 large eggs in a heat resistant bowl or double boiler. Melt
  6 oz butter in a separate pan. Beat the yolks with a wire wisk, OVER
  not in, boiling water until they begin to thicken. Very gradually add
  the clarified butter in a thin stream while constantly beating the
  mixture.
  
  A good rule of thumb: 1 LARGE egg yolk will hold 1 to
    1 1/2 oz of butter.
  
  Be very careful to add the butter slowly and that the butter is not
  hotter than the yolks or the sauce will "break" (begin to separate).
  As soon as all the butter is incorporated, remove the bowl from the
  heat source and keep beating to cool the sauce. Whip in the lemon
  juice, cayenne, and white wine.
  
  Variations on Hollandaise Sauce: Replace lemon juice with orange juice
  concentrate for Maltese Sauce.
  
  Replace juices and add tarragon, shallots, and basil for Bearnaise
  sauce. (saute the tarragon, basil, and minced shallots in some of the
  butter) See

  In a large, heavy frying pan, combine pork with cold water and heat to
  boiling point.  Add onion, celery, pepper, bay leaf, savoury,
  rosemary, nutmeg and cinnamon. Cook, covered, over medium-low heat

  through cooking time, season with salt to taste. Stir in rolled oats
  and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.
  
  Meanwhile, line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry.  When meat mixture is

  COMMENTS:Bake in miniature size and use as an hors d'oeuvre, suggests
  the owner of this recipe, who uses muffin pans for his favorite dish
  for a December family reunion. To accompany the mini-tourti=8Ares, he
  likes home-made tomato-and-peach ketchup and dry red wine. TIP: Add a
  pinch or two more herbes and spices. Heat oil in a large, heavy
  frying pan and saut=82 ground pork, veal and beef, breaking up meat
  until crumbly. Add garlic and onions, and saut=82 until vegetables
  are soft. Add beef broth, sage, ba= y leaf, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves,
  parsley flakes, dry celery leaves and celery seeds. Cover and simmer
  for 20 to 30 minutes. Add brandy and breadcrumbs. Blend in salt and
  pepper. Simmer briefly. Mixture should be moist. Cool. Preheat oven
  to 425'F.. Line 3 9-inch pie pans with pastry, reserving an equal
  amount of the dough for top crusts. Fill each pan with meat mixture.
  Cover with pastry, cutting two slits in the center of each pie to
  permit steam to escape. Brush each pie with beaten egg. Bake
  tourti=8Ares for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350'F. and cook until
  crust is golden-brown, about 25 minutes. Serve hot or cool
  completely, wrap and freeze. Makes 3 tourti=8Ares. From the MOTREAL

      Title: TRACEY'S MUSHROOM/TOFU LASAGNE
 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    900 g  Jar spaghetti sauce (I
           Prefer Ragu no-suga
    450 g  Lasagne noodles uncooked
    375 g  Block of soft tofu
    450 g  Cottage cheese
    450 g  Ricotta cheese
    450 g  Mozerella cheese sliced or
           Shredded
    450 g  Provolone cheese sliced or
           Shredded
     50 g  Parmesan cheese (approx.)
    225 g  Mushrooms thickly-sliced
 
  1.  Preheat oven to 180 øC .
  
  2.  In a large bowl, break up tofu with a fork until it looks like
  cottage cheese. Stir in the cottage and ricotta cheese until the
  mixture is uniform.
  
  3.  Put a small amount (50 ml) of spaghetti sauce in a large lasagne
  pan until the bottom is thinly coated. Add 3 or 4 uncooked lasagne
  noodles (they won't completely cover the bottom), then add enough
  sauce on top of noodles so that about 1/3 jar of sauce is used up.
  Next add 1/3 of sliced mushrooms, then 1/3 cottage cheese mixture,
  then 1/3 each of mozerella, provolone, and parmesan cheese. Make two
  more layers of noodles, sauce, mushrooms, cottage cheese, and sliced
  cheese.
  
  4.  Cover the lasagne with foil, making a "tent" if you can so the
  top does not touch to cheese. Make sure the edges are crimped
  tightly. Bake for 1 hour at 180 øC (you can take the foil off the
  last ten minutes if you want the cheese to brown), and let stand 15
  minutes to set. The noodles will be a little chewy, and the lasagne
  is also very good (perhaps even better!) reheated. .SH "Alternate
  Baking Instructions:" Bake the foil-covered lasagne for 45 minutes,
  then let cool. It can then be frozen or refrigerated for baking
  later. If frozen - bake at 180 øC (with foil) for 45 minutes. If
  refrigerated, bake at 180 øC (also with foil) for 20 minutes. These
  methods produce softer noodles.
  
  Difficulty    : moderate. Precision
  : approximate measurements.

      2 lg Packages (8 oz. each)
           -neufchatel or cream cheese
           -at room
           Temperature.
    3/4 c  Sugar
      4 lg Eggs
      1 c  Light or regular sour cream
      2 tb Orange-flavored liqueur *
      1 ts Vanilla
           Crust (recipe follows)
           Orange Sauce (recipe
           -follows)
      1 lb (about 1 large) firm-ripe
           -mango
           Fresh mint (optional)
           * (or 1/2 teaspoon grated
           -orange peel)
 
  This is heaven!  Probably the best cheesecake I've ever tasted. I
  cheated on the crust++just used a pre-made graham cracker crust from
  the market and it worked just fine. I used Grand Marnier for the
  orange liqueur. Thank God this is nice and low-cal!  ;-}
  
  In a large mixing bowl, beat cheese and sugar until creamy. Add eggs,
  1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add sour cream,
  liqueur and vanilla; beat until blended. Pour over crust. Bake in a
  325F oven until center of cake jiggles only slightly when gently
  shaken, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool completely on a rack. (If made ahead,
  cover and chill up until the next day.)
  
  Spoon about 1/3 of the lukewarm orange sauce over cheesecake, to
  within 1 inch of sides.  Peel mango. Cut fleshy cheeks off each side
  of pit, then cut off remaining fruit. Cut mango into thin slices 4 to
  5 inches long. Arrange over cheesecake, overlapping slightly. Spoon
  remaining sauce over fruit and cake to within about 1/4 inch of side.
  
  Cover; chill until sauce is set, about 30 minutes or up to 8 hours.
  Run a knife around inside edges of pan. Remove pan rim. Garnish with
  mint. With a sharp knife, cut cake into wedges.
  
  Makes about 12 servings.
  
  CRUST:
  
  Mix 1 1/2 cups finely crushed crisp coconut macaroon cookies with 1/4
  cup (1/3 pound) melted butter or margarine. Press mixture over bottom
  and about 1 inch up sides of a 9-inch cheesecake pan with removable
  rim. Bake in a 325F oven until lightly browned, about
       15    minutes.
  
  ORANGE SAUCE: In a 2- to 3-quart pan, mix 3 tablespoons sugar and 4
  teaspoons corn starch. Stir in 2/3 cup orange juice and 3 tablespoons
  orange-flavored liqueur (or orange juice). Stir over high heat until
  boiling.  Cool to lukewarm.

        2    recipes pate brisee
        3 lb (about 8) Northern Spies &
  :          McIntosh Apples
      3/4 c  plus 1 tablespoon sugar
        2 TB all-purpose flour
        1 ts cinnamon
      1/4 ts freshly grated nutmeg
      1/4 ts salt
        1 TB fresh lemon juice
        2 TB cold unsalted butter -- cut
  :          into bits
  :          Milk for brushing the crust
  
  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Roll out half the dough 1/8-inch
  thick on a lightly floured surface, fit it into a 9-inch (1-quart)
  glass pie plate, and trim the edge, leaving a 3/4-inch overhang.
  Chill the shell and the remaining dough while making the filling. In
  a large bowl toss together the apples, each peeled, cored, and cut
  into eighths, 3/4 cup of the sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt,
  and lemon juice until the mixture is combined well. Transfer the
  filling to the shell, and dot it with the butter.
  
  Roll out the remaining dough into a 13- to14-inch round on a lightly
  floured surface, drape it over the filling, and trim it, leaving a
  1-inch overhang. Fold the overhang under the bottom crust, pressing
  the edge to seal it, and crimp the edge decoratively. Brush the crust
  lightly with the milk, cut slits in it with a sharp knife, forming
  steam vents, and sprinkle the pie evenly with the remaining 1
  tablespoon sugar. Bake the pie on a large baking sheet in the middle
  of the oven for 20 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F,
  and bake the pie for 20 to 25 minutes more, or until the crust is
  golden and the apples are tender.

      Title: TRADITIONAL CARAMEL CUSTARD - FLAN A LA ANTIG
 Categories: Mexican, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Jim Vorheis
    3/4 c  Sugar
           The custard:
      1 qt Milk
      1 pn Of sea salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2    Inch cinnamon stick or
           -vanilla bean
           Small piece of orange or
           -lemon rind (optional)
      4    Eggs
      6    Egg yolks
 
  The caramel: Heat the sugar for the caramel in a small, heavy frying
  pan over low heat until it begins to dissolve. Shake the pan slightly
  (do not stir) until all the sugar has melted. Increase the flame and
  let the sugar bubble and color.  Pour the caramel into the mold and
  quickly turn it around in all directions, tipping it up in a circular
  motion until the surface - bottom and 2 inches up the sides - has
  been lightly coated with the caramel.  If the caramel thickens and
  becomes sluggish, gently heat the mold in a pan of hot water or over
  low heat, depending on the material, and continue the coating action.
  Set aside to cool.
  
  Put the milk, salt, sugar, and cinnamon or vanilla into a saucepan and
  bring slowly to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.
  Continue boiling slowly, taking care that it does not boil over,
  until the milk has reduced by about 2/3 cup.  Set aside to cool.
  
  Place an oven rack on the lowest rung of the oven and heat to 325 F.
  
  Beat the eggs and yolks together and stir into the tepid milk. Pour
  the mixture through a strainer into the flan mold and place it in a
  hot water bath in the oven. Test after 2 hours with a skewer or cake
  tester; if it comes out quite clean, the flan is cooked. Remove from
  the oven, but allow to sit in the water bath for about 15 minutes
  longer. Remove and set aside to cool completely before refrigerating.

  PREPARATION:  Make the Egg Pasta dough.  Roll as thin as possible and
  cut into 2-inch wide stripe or approximately 4-inch squares. Grate
  the Parmesan cheese. For The Bolognese Sauce, dice the onion, carrot,
  and celery. Mince the garlic. Melt butter in saucepan over medium
  heat; add the pork and cook until it just loses its pink color, about
  3 minutes. Add onion, carrot, and celery; cook until tender, about 5
  minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute. Add wine, stirring with wooden
  spoon to deglaze pan; simmer until reduced by 1/2, about 15 minutes.
  Add heavy cream and nutmeg; simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.
  Stir in tomatoes and their juice, breaking up with a wooden spoon.

  Gradually whisk in the milk and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
  Reduce heat; season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes. Cook
  the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water until tender, about
  3 minutes for fresh pasta.  Drain and refresh under cold water. Pour
  a thin layer of Bolognese Sauce into bottom of baking dish. Arrange a
  layer of pasta on top. Pour 1/3 of the Bolognese and then 1/3 of the
  Bechamel over pasta. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat for 2
  more layers, ending with the Parmesan cheese. NOTE:  Lasagne can be
  made to this point a day ahead (OR can be frozen). COOKING AND
  SERVING: Heat oven to 400F. Loosely cover lasagne with foil and bake
  until warmed through, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and put lasagne
  under broiler until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Let lasagne sit
  for 10 minutes before serving.

      Title: TRADITIONAL PIZZA DOUGH 1
 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Water (110 to 115 F.)
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 pk Dry Yeast
    1/4 c  Warm Water (110 to
           -115 Degrees F.)
      1 tb Olive Oil (Room Temperature)
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached Flour
           Additional Flour
           Additional Water
 
   HAND METHOD:
  
     Pour the first 1/4 Cup of water into a medium bowl and add the
  sugar and salt, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Sprinkle the yeast
  over the water mixture, stirring once to blend and let sit for 5
  minutes until the top is bubbly and the yeast has bloomed. Stir in
  the remaining warm water and the oil.  Place the flour in a large
  bowl and add the water and oil mixture to it.  Stir, adding enough
  flour to make a soft dough that will pull away from the sides of the
  bowl. If it is too dry, add a little water a tbls at a time.
  
   Turn the dough out on a well-floured work surface, sprinkle the top
  with a little additional flour. Knead until it become very springy,
  elastic and very smooth. It should be light in weight, if it is
  heavy, you have use too much flour and it will not raise properly.
   Form into a smooth ball and let rest on the work surface while you
  wash and clean the large bowl. Spray with a non-stick spray. Put the
  ball of dough into the bowl and turn it over to get some of the spray
  on the top. Cover with plastic wrap or a warm, damp, clean dishtowel.
  Let the dough rise in a warm, draft free place until double in
  volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
  
   If the dough rises before you are ready, punch it down in the bowl by
  kneading making sure all of the air is gone. Turn it over and reshape
  it into a ball and let rise again. If the top is dry, use a little
  olive oil to grease it.  You can punch the dough down and cover the
  bowl and keep the dough refrigerated for up to two days before
  letting it rise at room temperature.
  
   For a thin, crisp pizza crust punch the dough down and turn out and
  spread over a pizza pan or baking sheet or a bakers peel. Cover with
  filling and topping, baking at once.
  
   For thicker, softer pizza crust punch the dough down and turn out
  shaping as above and then cover lightly with a clean dishtowel. Let
  rise about 30 minutes before covering with filling and topping.
  
   Makes enough dough for one 12 to 14 inch round pizza, two 7 to 8-
  inch round pizzas or one oblong pizza, or one dozen appetizer-sized
  pizzas.

      Title: TRADITIONAL SODA CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 100 Servings
 
  1 1/2 ts Dry active yeast (1 package
           Contains 2-1/4 teaspoons)
    1/2 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
  4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 tb Water for disolving the
           Baking soda
      2 tb Plus 2 ts buttermilk
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Shortening
           Salt for the tops (opt.)
 
  "The incomparable lightness of traditional soda crackers results from
  the unusual techniques used in making them. Making soda crackers is
  easy, but it takes a relatively long time. The initial rise is 20 to
  30 hours, which allows the dough to increase in volume without
  developing a pronounced yeast flavor. Since the dough will ferment to
  some extent during this time, alkaline soda is then added to
  neutralize the acids produced by that fermentation. The dough is then
  allowed to rest 3 to 4 hours to relax the gluten so the crakers will
  not be tough and chewy. Next, the dough is rolled in layers. It is
  definitely worth the extra planning it takes to make these crakers.
  If you take a few minutes to get started on a Friday morning, the
  dough can have its long rest until the next day. Then you can finish
  the mixing and let the dough rest again while you run your weekend
  errands, baking the crackers in time for Saturday dinner. 450~ F 9 to
  11 minutes In a small bowl, combine the yeast with the sugar and warm
  water. Set aside until the yeast is fully dissolved, 5 to 10 minutes.
  Measure 3-1/2 cups of the flour into a large bowl. Stir in the yeast
  mixture and mix well. Place plastic wrap over the bowl and let the
  dough rest in a warm place for 20 to 30 hours. The plastic wrap keeps
  the dough from drying out during this long period. In a small bowl,
  dissolve the baking soda in the Tablespoon water. Place the baking
  soda mixture, buttermilk, salt, and shortening in the bowl with the
  dough and mix well. Mix in as much of the remaining 1/2 to 1 cup
  flour as necessary to form a stiff, nonsticky dough. Knead for a
  minute or two and then let the dough rest, covered with the plastic
  wrap, for 15 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough
  for another few minutes, until it is smooth and springy to the touch.
  Place it in a large, clean, lightly oiled bowl and let it rest for
  another 3 or 4 hours, covered with plastic wrap. At last you are
  ready to roll. Preheat the oven to 450~ F. Punch the dough down and
  knead a few strokes. Divide the dough into 3 equal portions for
  rolling. Rolling may be difficult at first due to the elasticity of
  the dough. Give yourself a head start on the rolling by flattening
  the dough with your hands. Place your rolling pin in the center of
  the dough and begin. Soon the dough will relax and begin to roll
  easily. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to a rectangle
  approximately 1/4 inch thick and position so the long edge runs
  horizontally in front of you. Fold the left third of the dough over
  the center third. Likewise, fold the right third over the center. The
  dough is now in 3 layers with the seam running vertically. Give the
  dough a quarter turn so the seam now runs horizontally. Roll out
  again to a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Fold and turn the dough
  again as in the first step. You are now ready for the final rolling.

 Categories: Desserts, Mexican
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      1 c  Sugar
      5 lg Eggs
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Flour
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar

MMMMM-------------------------MILK SYRUP------------------------------
      1 cn Evaporated milk 12 oz
      1 c  Sweetened condensed milk
      1 c  Heavy cream or whipping crem
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 tb Light rum

MMMMM--------------------------MERINGUE-------------------------------
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Cream of tarter
      3    Egg whites
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter a 13X9 in baking dish.
  Prepare the cake:  beat 3/4 of the sugar and the egg yolks until
  light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Fold in the milk, vanilla, flour
  and baking powder. Beat the egg whites to soft peaks, adding the
  cream of tarter after 20 seconds. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup
  sugar and continue beating until the whites are glossy and firm but
  not dry. Gently fold the whites into the yolk mixture. Pour this
  mixture into the buttered baking dish. Bake the cake until the cake
  feels firm and an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 40 to 50
  minutes.  Let the cake cool completely on a wire over with a fork.
  Prepare the milk syrup: combine the evaporated milk, sweetened
  condensed milk, cream, vanilla and rum in a mixing bowl. Whisk until
  well mixed.  Pour the syrup over the cake, spooning the overflow back
  on top until all is absorbed.
  
  Prepare the meringue:  Place 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbls of the sugar in a
  heavy saucepan with 1/4 cup of water. Cover and cook over high heat
  for 2 minutes.  Uncover the pan and cook the sugar to the soft ball
  stage, 239F on the candy thermometer, 6 - 8 minutes. Meanwhile, beat
  the egg whites to soft peaks with the cream of tarter. Add the
  remaining 2 Tbls sugar and continue beating to stiff peaks.  Pour the
  boiling sugar syrup i a thin stream into the whites and continue
  beating until the mixture is cool to touch. The hot syrup "cooks" the
  whites. Using a wet spatula, spread the top and sides of the cake
  with a thick layer of the meringue. Refrigerate the cake for at least
  2 hours before serving.

      6    Strawberries; -OR-
      6    Crystallized violets
 
  * Anne's note; I would use 1 cup sherry and not bother with the
  brandy * Citron is larger than a lemon. The fruit is not eaten but
  the rind id used as a decoration. Can be found in speciality stores,
  omit if you can't find it "Trifle, a favorite Victorian recipe, is
  the perfect party recipe. Make it well ahead of time of time, so that
  the sherry and brandy have enough time to seep into the cake. The
  charm of Trifle is its different textures. Since these also look
  interesting , Trifle should be served in a glass bowl so that the
  effect can be seen to full advantage. As an alternative serve it in
  individual glass dishes."
    Cut the cake into very thick slices and spread each piece with a
  generous amount of raspberry jam. Arrange the slices on the bottom of
  a large glass bowl. If you prefer to use individual dishes, divide
  the cake equally among the dishes. Sprinkle the almonds over the cake
  slices, pour on the brandy and sherry and allow it it to soak for
  about 40 minutes (but not longer as the cake will becomes soggy.
  *Anne's note, I like it soggy, and left the cake to soak overnight.)
  Bring the milk and cream with vanilla pod to a boil in a double
  boiler. Remove from heat and discard the vanilla pod.
    Mix the cornstarch with the sugar and eggs and gradually pour in
  the milk and cream. Transfer the mixture back to the double boiler
  and stir until the custard becomes thick and creamy; do not allow to
  boil.
    Let the custard cool a little and then pour it over the cake. Let
  the cake set and when it fully cooled, spread any remaining jam on
  top, then cover with whipped cream.
    Decorate the trifle with citron slices and crystallized violets or
  strawberry slices. Refrigerate until ready to serve. SERVES:6-8

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    9-inch sponge cake layer
    3/4 c  Dry sherry
      2 pk Frozen raspberries
      2 pk Frozen peaches
           Chilled custard sauce
      2    Egg whites
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Toasted slivered almonds
           Custard Sauce
      2 c  Milk
      6    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Sugar
           Pinch of salt
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  This is a wonderful recipe.  It calls for frozen fruit, but I don't
  see why you couldn't substitute fresh fruit if available.
  
  Thaw and drain fruit.  Slice sponge cake into three thin layers.
  Place one layer in the bottom of a serving bowl. It should be
  flat-bottomed and about 10 inches across and five inches deep. If you
  have one of glass, use it because the layers of the trifle look very
  pretty. Sprinkle the cake layer with one-quarter cup sherry. Spread
  about 1 third of the raspberries and peach slices on top. Pour
  one-third of the custard over the fruit. Repeat cake, sherry, fruit
  and custard layers, saving a dozen or so raspberries for garnish. To
  make the topping, beat egg white until stiff and in a separate bowl,
  whip cream. Stir sugar into cream and gently fold in beaten egg
  white. Mound cream and egg white mixture over the top of the trifle.
  Garnish with raspberries and toasted almonds. Refrigerate until ready
  to serve.
  
  Custard Sauce: Scald milk in a double boiler. Meanwhile, beat egg
  yolks and add sugar and salt. Pour a little hot milk into the egg
  yolk mixture, beating with a fork, and then stir into the rest of the
  milk. Place over simmering, not boiling, water and cook -- stirring
  until the mixture coats a metal spoon. Pour the cutard into a bowl
  and stir in the vanilla. Cover and refrigerate for one hour or until
  thickened before adding to trifle. From: Sandee Eveland

           -strawberries
           Additional bananas
           Whipped cream
           Fresh mint sprigs(optional)
 
  Cake: Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly spray 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1-inch
  jelly roll pan with vegetable oil spray. Line bottom of pan with
  waxed paper, extending paper slightly at short ends; spray paper.
  Using electric mixer, beat 5 eggs, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar,
  1-3/4 teaspoons vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon salt in large bowl until
  mixture triples in volume and is thick enough to fall in heavy ribbon
  when beaters are lifted, about 12 minutes. Sift 1/2 cup plus 2
  tablespoons flour over batter in 2 additions, gently folding just to
  combine after each addition. Drizzle 2 1/2 tablespoons butter over
  and fold in gently (do not overmix or batter will deflate). Pour
  batter evenly into prepared pan.
  
  Custard: Place milk in medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla
  bean; add bean. Bring to boil. Whisk yolks, sugar and flour in medium
  bowl until smooth. Gradually whisk in hot milk mixture. Return
  mixture to pan; whisk over medium heat until custard thickens and
  boils, about 4 minutes. Strain into medium bowl. Press plastic wrap
  onto surface. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. Using electric
  mixture, beat cream in medium bowl to stiff peaks. Fold cream into
  cold custard. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
  
  Syrup: Stir sugar and 1/3 cup water in heavy small saucepan over low
  heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring
  until syrup turns deep amber, brushing down sides of pan with wet
  pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally. Remove from heat. Add 3
  tablespoons water (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir until
  caramel is smooth. Pour caramel into medium bowl; mix in remaining 2
  tablespoons water. Cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; let stand
  at room temperature.)
  
  Assembly: Sift generous amounts of powdered sugar over 2 kitchen
  towels. Cut around pan sides to loosen cakes. Turn cakes out onto
  prepared towels. Peel off paper.
  
  Stir jam and 2 tablespoons rum in small bowl to blend. Cut each cake
  crosswise in half. Spread half of jam mixture over 1 piece of each
  cake. Gently press second piece of each cake onto jam.
  
  Cut cake sandwiches crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Arrange
  enough cake strips in 3 1/2- to 4-quart glass trifle dish or bowl to
  cover bottom, trimming strips to fit and allowing jam layer to show
  at sides. Brush cake layer with 2 tablespoons rum. Top with half of
  sliced berries, arranging some to show at sides of dish.

 Categories: Cambrian, Critters, Extinct, Seafood, Weird
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Fresh trilobites*
      1 qt Water
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      3 md Yellow onions; chopped
      2 lg Bell peppers (red, green or
           -yellow); chopped
      5    Ribs celery; chopped fine
     10 lg Tomatoes; peeled, seeded
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Red pepper; ground
    1/2 ts Black pepper; ground
    1/2 ts White pepper; ground
      2 ts Dried thyme
      2 ts Dried basil
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      5 ea Bay leaf
      1 c  Green onions; chopped
      1 c  Parsley; chopped
      1 ts Tabasco sauce; or more to
           -taste
 
  *If trilobites are out of season or extinct in your area, shrimp or
  crawfish may be substitued.
  
  Peel and devein the trilobites. Place heads (if you still have them),
  and peels in a small saucepan and add water. Bring to a slow boil over
  medium-high heat and boil slowly for 15-20 minutes. Strain and
  discard the heads and peels. Retain the stock.
  
  Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place over
  medium-high heat. Add the onions, peppers and celery and saute,
  stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes.
  Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar and shrimp stock
  and return to simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and let simmer for 2
  hours, stirring occasionally. This is your creole sauce and it can be
  prepared 1-2 days in advance and stored in the 'fridge. The flavors
  improve after sitting a couple of days.
  
  When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and add the
  trilobites. Cook until they turn pink, about 7 minutes. Stir in the
  green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more. Serve on
  rice.

           Salt and Pepper, to taste

MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------

           - (see note)
      1 pn Finely Julienned, lightly
           - fried Zucchini (see note)
 
  Each of the three grain combinations can be formed using timbales or
  other molds, or by the quenelle method using two large tablespoons.
  
  COUSCOUS, RICE AND QUINOA:  Heat all couscous ingredients in a double
  boiler until warmed through. Pack mixture into 6 small timbale molds
  (or scoop mixture in a tablespoon, round a second tablespoon over the
  mixture and press spoons together).  Unmold mixture and set aside.
  
  Repeat procedure with basmati rice ingredients; set aside.
  
  Repeat with quinoa ingredients; set aside.
  
  COULIS:  Grill, broil or roast corn in their husks for 10 to 12
  minutes, until corn is cooked.  Discard husks and remove kernels from

  a sauce. Pass mixture through a fine strainer, and season the liquid
  with salt and pepper.
  
  TO SERVE:  Pour coulis on 6 plates and place one serving of each
  grain on each plate.  Garnish couscous with fried sage leaves;

  NOTES: To make tomato concasse, peel, seed and dice tomatoes and toss
  with olive oil, salt and pepper.
  
  To make shiitake duxelles, finely mince mushrooms and saute in oil
  with a pinch of minced shallot or onion.
  
  To fry sage leaves and zucchini for the garnishes, heat 3/4 inch of
  oil in a pan to 350 F (a drop of water should ripple and pop on
  surface of the oil); fry sage leaves for 1 minute, remove to a paper
  towel and drain.	Repeat with finely julienned zucchini, frying just
  until golden.

 Categories: Italian, Meats, Mrs. g, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           - G. Granaroli XBRG76A
           - MM:MK VMXV03A
      3 lb Honyeycomb tripe
      4 tb Butter
      4 tb Olive oil
      1 lg Onion sliced
    1/3 c  Fresh chopped parsley
      8 oz Can tomato sauce
      1 c  Water
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Parboil the tripe for about 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, cut
  into strips about 1"by 3". Saute onion in butter and olive oil. When
  they are golden add the rest of the ingredients andmix well. Simmer
  for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until tender. If needed, add a bit more water
  at the end to make just a bit of sauce to soak up with some good
  crusty bread. Serve hot with grated cheese on the side. Don`t forget
  the bread.
   Variation: with a few minor adjustments, you can use this as a pasta
  sauce. Cut the tripe a bit smaller and add about 4 more oz of tomato
  sauce and 1/2 cup of dry wine, white or red. This will give you more
  sauce for the spaghetti. Don`t forget to adjust the salt and pepper.

      Title: TRIPLE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------DARK CHOCOLATE MOUSSE------------------------
      2 tb Strongly brewed coffee, cool
      2 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 ts Unflavored powdered gelatin
      3 lg Egg yolks
  1 1/4 c  Heavy cream, divided
    3/4 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar
      6 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
           -finely chopped

MMMMM-------------------MILK CHOCOLATE MOUSSE------------------------
      2 tb Strongly brewed coffee, cool
      2 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 ts Unflavored powdered gelatin
      3 lg Egg yolks
  1 1/4 c  Heavy cream, divided
    3/4 c  Milk
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      6 oz Milk chocolate, chop fine

MMMMM-------------------WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE------------------------
      2 tb Coconut rum, such as Malibu
      1 tb Water
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      2 ts Unflavored powdered gelatin
      8 oz White chocolate,
           -coarsely chopped
    3/4 c  Milk
      1 c  Heavy cream
 
  Make the dark chocolate mousse layer: Place the coffee and vanilla in
  a small cup. Sprinkle the gelatin over the mixture and let the
  gelatin soften for 5 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks until
  blended. In a heavy, medium saucepan, combine 3/4 cup of the cream,
  the milk and sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
  until small bubbles form around the side of the pan. Remove the pan
  from the heat. Gradually whisk about 3/4 cup of the hot cream mixture
  into the yolks until blended. Pour this mixture back into the
  saucepan. Continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring constantly
  with a wooden spoon for 2 to 4 minutes, until the custard has
  thickened slightly. It is done when you can run your finger down the
  back of the coated spoon and a path remains in the custard for
  several seconds. Do not allow the custard to boil. Remove the pan
  from the heat and immediately strain the custard into a stainless
  steel bowl. Add the softened gelatin mixture to the custard and stir
  until completely dissolved. Add the chocolate and stir until melted
  and smooth. Set the bowl over a larger bowl containing ice water and
  stir for 5 to 10 minutes, until cool. Remove the bowl from the bowl
  of ice water. In a chilled medium bowl, using a handheld electric
  mixer, beat the remaining 1/2 cup of the cream until soft peaks start
  to form. Using a rubber spatula, fold one third of the whipped cream
  into the chocolate mixture. Fold in the remaining whipped cream.
  Scrape the mousse into a 9-by-3-inch springform pan and, using a
  small offset metal cake spatula, smooth it into an even layer. Place
  the pan in the freezer for 1 hour, until the mousse is firmly set.
  
  Make the milk chocolate mousse layer: Follow the procedure in the
  steps above, substituting the ingredients listed for the milk
  chocolate mousse layer for those in the dark chocolate mousse layer,
  and pouring the milk chocolate mousse over the dark chocolate mousse
  layer in the pan. Place the pan in the freezer for 1 hour, until the
  mousse is firmly set.
  
  Make the white chocolate mousse layer: Place the rum, water and
  vanilla in a small, heatproof cup. Sprinkle the gelatin over the
  mixture and allow it to soften for 5 minutes. Place the cup with the
  softened gelatin in a small pan with enough water to come halfway up
  the sides of the cup. Heat the gelatin mixture in hot, not simmering,
  water. Stir the gelatin frequently for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the
  gelatin granules dissolve completely and the mixture is clear. Remove
  the pan from the heat, leaving the cup in the water to keep the
  gelatin mixture warm until ready to use. Place the chocolate in a
  large bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the milk to a
  gentle boil. Pour the hot milk over the chocolate and let the mixture
  stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Add the warm gelatin
  mixture and whisk until smooth. Place the bowl over a larger bowl of
  ice water and stir for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture is cool.
  In a chilled, medium bowl, using a handheld electric mixer, beat the
  cream at medium speed just until it begins to form soft mounds. Do
  not overbeat or the mousse will be grainy. Fold one-third of the
  whipped cream into the white chocolate mixture. Fold in the remaining
  whipped cream. Scrape the white chocolate mousse onto the milk
  chocolate mousse layer, smoothing the top with a cake spatula. Place
  the cake in the freezer for 2 hours, until the top layer is firmly
  set.
  
  Unmold the cake: Using a portable hair dryer or a damp, hot towel,
  carefully heat the outside of the springform pan slightly. Release the
  clamp on the side of the springform pan and gently remove it. Using a
  large metal spatula, gently transfer the cake from the bottom of the
  springform pan to a serving platter. Place the cake in the
  refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving.
