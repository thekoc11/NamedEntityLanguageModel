      2 c  Corn; fresh, frozen, canned              Vegetable coating spray
      1 ts Vegetable Bouillon granules;   
 
  Method: In a large heavy stew pot, place bouillon and 1/2 C white
  grape juice, onion, green pepper, celery garlic, cook until tender,
  5-7 minutes. Add other ingredients, cook over low heat, stirring
  occasionally to keep from sticking to bottom. Cover and simmer gently
  until corn and okra are done. (or simmer in crockpot 6-7 hours)
  
  Note:  Cut fresh corn from cob with a sharp knife, then scrape the
  remaining corn off the cob.  Four ears will make about two cups. If
  you use dried herbs, rub them with the palms of your hands before
  adding to the pot, this releases their aroma and goodness. Exchanges:

      Title: Our Lemon Pie
 Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Pies
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      3 tb Margarine;                         27 pk Equal sweetener;
     10    Graham cracker squares;             2    Egg yolks;
    1/2 c  Skimmed evaporated milk;            2 lg Lemons; 1/2 cup juice
           -cold                               3    Egg whites;
      1 pk Dream Whip;                         3 tb Sugar;
 
  Melt margarine on medium to low heat.  Roll graham crackers into
  crumbs with rolling pin.  Mix crumbs and melted margarine. Pat to
  make crust on bottom and sides of pie pan. Chill.
  
  Add cold evaporated milk to Dream Whip (do not add vanilla). Sprinkle
  in 24 pkg. Equal.  Mix and beat according to directions. Beat egg
  yolks slightly, and gradually stir in lemon juice. Gradually fold in
  the whipped Dream Whip.  Spread in pie crust.  Turn on broiler so it
  will get hot. Beat 3 egg whites frothy (use clean beaters so whites
  will beat up as fluffy as possible).  Add 1 tbs. sugar and beat until
  blended in. Add another tbs. sugar and 3 Equal pkg. and beat until
  soft peaks form. Spread meringue over top. Spread meringue to stick
  to the edges so it won't shrink when you broil it.
  
  Put under broiler for 30-60 seconds until meringue is lightly
  browned. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG AT ALL AND IS EASY TO BURN. The flavors
  will blend better if you chill for 5 hours.

  the 2 1/2 round cutter and weight of a little over 1 ounce per
  cookie. You may use other cutters as long as the finished cookie
  weighs about 1 ounce per cookie, and you might even make a 2-ounce
  cookie and figure the nutritive value and exchanges as twice those
  for the smaller cookie. You may add flavorings other than vanilla and
  lemon; if add nuts, raisins and the like, however, you are altering
  the nutritve values and exchanges for each cookie.

  apricots. Leave out walnuts to reduce the fat and use 2 egg whites

  Combine the water, honey, and yeast in a large bowl.  Let sit for 5
  minutes until foamy.  Add the flour 1 cup at a time, beating well
  after each addition.  When the dough becomes to stiff to mix, turn it
  out onto a floured board and knead for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth
  and elastic. Put it in a very lightly oiled bowl, cover, and allow to
  rise for 1 hour. <If a very light dough is desired, you may punch it
  down, cover, and allow to rise another 40 to 45 minutes)
  
  While the dough is rising, combine the peanut butter and honey in a
  saucepan and mix over low heat until easily blended (or warm in
  microwave until easily blended).  Beat in all the remaining
  ingredients except the raisins.
  
  Remove the risen dough from the bowl and knead about ten times on a
  clean board.  Roll out into a large rectangle about 15" X 14". Spread
  with filling to 1/2" of the edge.  sprinkle raisins evenly over the
  filling. Roll the rectangle into a log, starting at the 15-in side,
  pinch the edges to seal, and slice into 1" thick rounds. <They will
  be VERY gooey> Place on a nonstick baking sheet, cover, and allow to
  rise for about 20 minutes, or until light.  Bake in a preheated 350 F
  oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown on top.

  bowl, turn it over so the top of the ball is also oiled, and cover it
  with a towel. Let it rise in a warm (85 to 90 F) place for about 45
  minutes, or until it is doubled in volume.
  
  Shape the dough into a loaf, place it in an oiled 8 x 4 inch loaf
  pan, and let it rise in a warm place again for about 30 minutes, or
  until it doubles in volume.  Bake at 425 F for 10 minutes, then lower
  the oven temperature to 350 F for an additional 35 to 45 minutes of
  baking. Remove it from the oven when the loaf is brown and has pulled
  away from the sides of the pan slightly.  Makes one loaf.

  375F for about 10 minutes, longer if cooking from cold.  (I found it
  needed about 20 minutes or longer, so keep an eye on it).

  baking pan and bake in 400 F oven for 30 minutes.  Cool, peel and

 Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Allergy, Low-fat/cal

      2 c  Unsweetened apple juice;          1/3 c  Granulated sugar substitute;
    1/3 c  Cornstarch;                       1/2 ts Cinnamon;
      1    Egg; (or 2 yolks)              
 
  MY NOTE:  This recipe is marked in the allergy category only because
  it is a pudding without milk, also low in protein. It is one of my
  favorite ways to use up egg yolks or prepare a dessert when I've run
  out of milk. Probably does not require as much sweetening as stated
  in the recipe - start with 2 Tbsp. sweetener and add more if
  necessary. Cost to make the whole recipe is around $1.22.
  
  In a heavy saucepan, combine 1/2 cup apple juice and cornstarch; mix
  well. Add remaining juice.  Place over medium heat and cook,
  stirring, until mixture comes to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for
  2 minutes. Remove from heat.
  
  In a bowl, beat egg with a fork.  Add 1/2 cup of hot mixture to
  beaten egg. Stir until smooth.  Return immediately to hot mixture,
  stirring constantly. (The hot mixture will cook the egg.)
  
  Stir in sweetener and cinnamon.  Pour into 4 dessert dishes, cover
  with plastic wrap to prevent skin from forming.  Cool to room
  temperature or chill in refrigerator.

      Title: Chocolate and Peanut Butter Crescents
 Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Cooky/bars
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      2 c  Sifted all purpose flour            1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa                 3/4 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 ts Salt                                1    Egg
    1/4 lb (1 stick) butter               
 
  Sift together the flour, cocoa, and salt and set aside.  In the large
  bowl of an electric mixer cream the butter.  Beat in the vanilla and
  sugar. Add the egg and beat until thoroughly mixed.  On low speed
  gradually add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl with a
  rubber spatula and beating until the mixture holds together. Transfer
  the dough to a small bowl for ease in handling and set aside at room
  temperature. Prepare the filling.
  
  3/4 cup smooth (not chunky) peanut butter 1/2 cup strained or sifted
  confectioners sugar.
  
  In a small bowl thoroughly mix the peanut butter and the sugar.
  
  Adjust rack to the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees.
  
  To shape the cookies:  On a large piece of wax paper place the cookie
  dough in mounds, using a slightly rounded tsp. (no more) of the dough
  for each mound-in order not to make them too large it's best to
  measure with a measuring spoon.  Do maybe a quarter of the dough at a
  time.
  
  Then do the same with the filling, using a level 1/2 measuring
  teaspoon for each mound.  Place on other pieces of waxed paper.
  
  Pick up one mound of the dough, roll it between your hands into a
  ball, and flatten it between your palms until it is very thin.  Then,
  with a small metal spatula or a table knife, lift up and place one
  mound of the filling in the center of the flattened dough.  With your
  fingers bring the dough around the filling and pinch the edges to
  seal. Roll the filled dough between your hands into a cylindrical
  shape about 2 inches long with very slightly tapered ends.  Place the
  cookie on an unbuttered cookie sheet and as you do, turn the ends
  down slightly to form a short fat crescent. Continue shaping the
  cookies and placing them 1/2 to 1 inch apart-these do not spread.
  
  Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until the cookies are firm to the touch.
  Reverse the cookie sheet front to back once to insure even bakinZ of
  sugar and roll the cookies in the sugar as they come out of oven.

      Title: Diet Cream Soup Base
 Categories: Diabetic, Allergy, Soups/stews, Crockpot, Low-fat/cal
      Yield: 2 servings
 
           WHITE SAUCE                         8 oz Can tomato sauce
  3 1/2 tb Instant milk powder                 3 tb Chopped onion
  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch                          1 pn Dry rosemary, crumbled
  1 1/4 c  Cold water                          1 pn Fresh ground pepper
           TOMATO                              1 pn Cayenne pepper
 
  This recipe is suitable for anyone who needs to know the exact
  contents of soup.
  OTHER OPTIONS: Regular recipes use about 1 1/2 Tb butter and 1 1/2 Tb
  flour per cup of milk for a medium white sauce.
  
  5 oz evaporated milk plus 5 oz water plus 1 Tb corn starch
  
  1 cup soy milk plus 1 Tb corn starch
  
  1 cup skim milk plus 1 Tb vegetable oil plus 1 Tb corn starch
  
  Put ingredients in a blender and process at high speed until well
  blended, or put ingredients in a jar and shake, or stir dry
  ingredients into cold milk with a whisk.
  
  Stir constantly in the top of a double boiler until the sauce
  thickens and simmers, then cook ten minutes.  A medium saucepan set
  in a larger saucepan of simmering water works, too.
  
  Fresh tomatoes may be cooked with onion and seasoning, allowed to
  cool and pureed in a blender to make the sauce.  If the tomato
  mixture is colder, add a little of the hot white sauce to bring it to
  the same temperature. This prevents curdling when the red mixture is
  gradually added back into the pot with the white sauce.
  
  Heat soup until it is hot enough to serve but do not allow it to boil.
  
  The same method may be used with 3/4 to 1 cup of cooked diced (or
  pureed) vegetables with cooking liquid used to make the sauce.  Makes
  about 2 cups. Suggested vegetables:  potato with a little onion,
  carrot, zucchini, cabbage with a little ham, sauteed onion, mushroom,
  broccoli. Season to taste.
  
  Tested Dec 93 using powdered milk, and (thawed) canned tomato by
  Elizabeth Rodier.  This was a successful experiment based on a

  calories) Source:  Choice Cooking, Canadian Diabetes Association 1986
  Real sugar - add 48 calories & 12.4 grams carbohydrate per extra Tb.
  Cornstarch - add 29 calories & 7 grams carbohydrate per extra Tb. Egg
  ~ subtract 1 med-fat meat exchange if not used. Adjust for the number
  of servings.
  
  Note:  original recipe is for a sauce, try 2 tbsp cornstarch and
  divide among 3 dishes for a pudding/pie filling with one crumbled
  graham cracker and a shake of cinnamon in the bottom of each dish.
  
  EGGLESS:  1 or 2 extra tsp. cornstarch (5 tsp or 2 tb.) would likely
  thicken the sauce without the egg.  1 tsp. cornstarch plus 3 tb.
  liquid is given as an equivalent to 1 whole egg in the book called
  Substituting Ingredients.
  
  Lemon Sauce may be served with cake, gingerbread, and crisp meringues
  with strawberries or other fruit (Pavlova is the common name in
  Australian cookbooks).

      2    Bananas; ripe, mashed               2 ts Baking powder;

  1 3/4 c  Flour;                         
 
  Adapted from The Joslin Diabetes Gourmet Cookbook, 1993 which used 1
  large egg white plus 6 tbsp. egg substitute, 1/8 tsp almond extract,
  orange juice concentrate, 2 cups unbleached flour and no orange peel.
  
  Original nutritional info. 1/18 recipe = 1 bread, 1 fat Joslin
  Exchanges 122 calories, 2 grams protein, 14 grams carbohydrate, 6
  grams fat (44% of calories), trace cholesterol, 61 mg sodium, 105 mg
  potassium.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Line a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan with waxed paper
  and spray with cooking spray.
  
  In a large bowl, combine bananas, oil, beaten egg, juice concentrate
  and orange peel.  Stir dry ingredients together and then stir them
  into banana mixture until just blended.
  
  Spread the batter in the pan and bake for 45 minutes or until the top
  is lightly browned.  Cool in a pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a
  wire rack.  Slice the first sample while the loaf is still warm.
  Comment in the original recipe states that the well-wrapped loaf
  keeps in the refrigerator and freezes well.  Slice is smaller than a
  slice of regular bread (about half size).
  
  Tested with changes noted by Elizabeth Rodier, Jan 1994.  To cut down
  on cholesterol use 1 whole egg and 2 whites, or home made egg
  substitute.
  
  When comparing bread recipes, consider serving size as well as
  calories. Does the serving taste good alone or would I add 1 tsp
  margarine (1 fat)?

      2    Dried thyme                         1    Grated nutmeg
 
  Combine all ingredients (or those of your choice) and store in an
  airtight jar.  Yield about 3 tbsp.  (My note:  cautious with white
  pepper! - my dressing tastes good with just 1/2 the quantity of sage
  as the recipe amount of poultry seasoning and a generous grinding of
  black pepper.)
  
  Keep a note of the contents of your own poultry seasoning so you can
  duplicate a good one next time you want it.

      1 c  Concentrated apple juice            5 tb Glycerine
    1/4 c  Lemon juice                         1 tb Unfl.gelatin or 2 tb.freezer
 
  Wash and pick over cranberries, discarding any that are soft.  Place
  in a deep saucepan and add fruit juices.  Cover and simmer for about
  20 minutes, until fruit is soft.  Mash to break up any berries left
  whole.
  
  Strain in food mill to remove seeds.  Return to saucepan and heat to
  boiling.  Add pectin, glycerine and gelatin, stirring well.  Boil for
  1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Skim and pour into hot, sterile pint
  jars, leaving 1/2 inch at top.  Cap with hot sterile lids.  Process
  in boiling water bath for 5 minutes after water returns to boiling.
  If any jars fail to seal, refrigerate and use within 10 days or
  freeze for later use. Makes 3 1/2 cups.
  
  VARIATION:  You can substitute 1/2 cup low-methoxy pectin solution
  and 2 1/2 tsp calcium solution for the liquid pectin and glycerine,
  but add calcium after removing from heat.  If you plan to freeze the
  jelly, be sure to use the full amount of gelatin.

  1 1/2 c  Whole bean flour (try puree)      1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Cornstarch                          6 tb Vegetable shortening

      1 ts GF baking powder                  3/4 c  Cold water
 
  Bean flour is a new product being promoted by the Ontario Coloured
  Bean Growers of Ontario.  If not available to you, try white bean
  puree. Less fat is required with bean flour than whole wheat flour
  for pastry.
  
  Stir together dry ingredients, then cut in shortening until mixture is
  crumbly using pastry blender or 2 knives.  Try adding puree
  alternately with shortening.
  
  Whisk together egg white and a little less water if using bean puree.
  Stir into dry ingredients to make a soft dough.  Divide dough in
  half. Roll dough out to 1/8" thickness on a cornstarch dusted
  surface, between layers of waxed paper or layers of plastic wrap.
  Press into pan, patching if necessary.
  
  For pie shell or single crust: Trim edge leaving half-inch overhang
  to tuck under and flute edge. Line inside of pastry shell with piece
  of foil. Bake at 400 F for 15 minutes or until edges are golden
  brown, remove foil.
  
  For double-crust pie: Trim edge, fill, roll top pastry. Tuck 1/2 inch
  overhang under edge of bottom crust, press firmly together. Flue
  edges. Cut steam vents. Bake as recipe directs for filling.

    1/3 c  Lightly packed brown sugar          1 ts Cinnamon

      1 c  Flour, divided 1/4 cup aside   
 
  My note:  these keep fairly well in a covered container, and freeze
  well according to the cookbook.  Try ginger (used in some Australian
  ANZAC cookies) instead of cinnamon.
  
  Cream butter and sugar together thoroughly, then beat in water.  Set
  aside 1/4 cup flour for rolling.  Mix together the remaining dry
  ingredients, then stir them into the creamed mixture.
  
  Add the remaining flour gradually to the dough until it is stiff
  enough to roll.  Divide the dough into 3 lumps about the same size.
  Roll each lump of dough out about 1/8 inch thick and cut into 12
  pieces about the same size. This is much easier than trying to use a
  cookie cutter if you need to know cookies per serving.
  
  Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 F about 10
  minutes or until golden brown around the edges.  Remove from pan,
  cool. Store in a covered container.  Makes about 36 cookies.

  The Asparagus and Carrots made 1/3 cup per 1 person...you  could have
  a free salad also.  This was very taste....even a family member that
  don't like cooked carrots, like these cook carrots.  Also we just
  nuked in the mircowave stove for about 10 minutes.  The lemon juice
  and the lemon pepper really did make a nice change for us. (are tryig
  hard to cut back on the fat.)  Used fresh asparagus.

      1    Info/help                      
 
  REDUCE CHOLESTEROL ~ Use vegetable oil or margarine instead of butter
  ~ Substitute 2 egg whites for 1 egg, or use egg substitute ~ Use more
  vegetables and grains and less meat in recipe ~ Use soy-based product
  to replace part of meat eg. tofu ~ Use nonfat milk products instead
  of whole milk
  
  REDUCE FAT CONTENT ~ Use reduced calorie mayonnaise and salad
  dressing ~ Blend cottage cheese or yogurt with milk for sour cream
  topping ~ Replace regular whipping cream with low-cal topping or
  yogurt ~ Remove visible fat from meat and skin from poultry before
  cooking ~ Decrease oil in marinades and salad dressing; increase
  vinegar, water and seasonings ~ Use foods canned in their own juice
  or water ~ De-fat meat drippings by refrigerating and skimming fat
  off the top ~ Decrease the amount of fat used in baked goods by 1/3
  to 1/2 and increase fluids called for to reach desired consistency. ~
  Cheese that is finely grated or thinly sliced goes further ~ Pour
  some of the fat off the top of "natural" peanut butters
  
  REDUCE SODIUM CONTENT ~ Use low-salt or no-salt-added products ~
  Increase your use of herbs and spices in place of salt in recipes ~
  Use fresh foods whenever possible in place of canned or processed
  (soup mixes, cured meats etc) or rinse canned foods (tuna) with water
  ~ Do not add salt to water when cooking pasta or other foods
  
  REDUCE SUGAR CONTENT ~ Decrease the amount of sugar called for in
  traditional recipes by at least 1/3; substitute fruit juices, nectars
  or pureed fruits. ~ Use fruit canned in water or fruit juice ~ Use
  non caloric sweeteners if needed to increase the sweetness of a
  recipe without added calories.  (Most baked desserts require at least
  3/4 tsp. sugar per serving to achieve a desirable flavor.)

      Yield: 12 servings
 
    3/4 c  Natural bran                    1 1/3 c  Cranberry sauce
    3/4 c  Flour                               1    Egg, lightly beaten
    1/2 c  Sugar (Diabetic try 1/4 cup)      1/3 c  Soured milk (1/2 tb lemon j)
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon                          1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 ts Baking powder                       1 ts Grated orange rind
      1 ts Baking soda                    
 
  You may use commercial or home made cranberry sauce but not
  artifically sweetened sauce (muffins will not rise.) .  Original
  recipe in The Lighthearted Cookbook by Anne Lindsay published in 1988
  in Canada used whole-wheat flour, and 1/2 cup buttermilk or low-fat
  plain yogurt rather than sour milk.
  
  1/12 original recipe - 156 calories, 1 starch, 1 fat, 1 fruit choice 5
  grams fat, 2 grams protein, 27 grams carbohydrate, 23 mg cholesterol,
  126 mg sodium   NOTE:  listed ingredients & variations would be
  slightly different.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 F and spray at least 12 muffin cups lined with
  paper baking cups.  Low-fat muffins tend to stick even to non-stick
  pans.
  
  Measure 1/2 tbsp lemon juice in a measuring cup, fill to about 1/4
  cup mark with fluid milk and add some skim milk powder to make it a
  little thicker. Set aside.
  
  Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.
  
  Add remaining ingredients of your choice and stir until they are just
  combined.  Bake about 20 minutes or until lightly browned and firm to
  the touch.  Adjust time if muffins are made smaller.
  
  VARIATIONS, substitute for cranberry: Banana-Date - use 1 cup mashed
  banana and 1/2 cup dates or raisins. If 2 bananas are not quite 1 cup,
  concentrated orange juice or orange/pineapple may be added. (Tested
  Jan 94 by Elizabeth Rodier, family member ate 2 warm ones.)
  
  Apple-Raisin - 1 cup applesauce plus 1/2 cup raisins, or coarsely
  chop an unpeeled apple in a food processor.
  
  Zucchini - 1 cup grated unpeeled zucchini plus 1/2 cup raisins.
  
  May be made as 16-18 small muffins or 9 inch square cake cut in the
  desired number of pieces.  For a diabetic meal plan, reduce the
  amount of sugar to 1/4 cup or 1 tsp. per serving (recommended
  guideline of American Diabetes Assoc.)
  
  This recipe is typical of healthy heart recipes with reduced sodium,
  cholesterol and fat but more sugar than a typical diabetic recipe.

      Title: Brown 'n' Serve Sausage
 Categories: Meats, Diabetic
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 lb Lean ground pork                  1/2 ts Thyme
    1/4 c  Cracker crumbs                    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/4 c  Water                             1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Sage                                1 pn Ground cloves
      1 ts Salt                           
 
  The two step cooking procedure ensures the removal of most of the fat.
  
  Combine ground pork and cracker crumbs.  Stir in water, sage, salt,
  thyme, oregano, pepper and cloves.  Mix until thoroughly combined.
  
  Divide into 12 portions.  Form each into a sausage-shaped roll or flat
  patty.  (Wet hands with cold water to make the job easy.)  Place in a
  cold, lightly oiled frypan.
  
  Cook over medium heat, turning often, about 4 min each side until just
  beginning to brown and pieces are no longer pink.
  
  Remove to paper towels and blot to absorb any fat.  Wrap.  Store in
  refrigerator up to 5 days or in freezer up to 2 months.  Or cook a
  second time and serve immediately.
  
  To serve:  Return sausages or patties to a clean, cold frypan.  Cook
  over medium heat, turning once or twice, about 4 min until sausages
  are brown and crisp.  (Cook frozen sausages in the same manner,
  allowing about 2 min longer for cooking.

  carbohydrate, 7 g protein, 3 g fat.

  Suggestion for Pork Pies: Stir-cook the ground pork mixture in the
  frying pan, place it in a plastic colander to drain off most of the
  fat and blot with paper towels.  Spread the pork mixture in a baking
  dish (try 8" pyrex), add fat-free gravy if needed for liquid. Top
  with about 2 1/4 cups seasoned breadcrumbs.  Bake at 350-375 F until
  crumbs are lightly browned.

  possible grease escaping from the jelly roll pan.  I would also spoon
  off some of the fat from the loaf after 30 minutes.

  CURRIED POTATO CHOWDER:
  In a large nonstick covered skillet that has been lightly sprayed with
  cooking spray, cook onions and garlic over low heat until onions wilt,
  about 15 minutes.  Stir frequently. Uncover, stir in sugar, and
  continue to cook, stirring often, until onions begin to brown.
  Meanwhile, in a large saucepan. bring stock to a boil.  Add potatoes,
  reduce heat to a simmer, and cook unitl potatoes are tender when
  pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes.  Add onions.  Add wine to
  skillet; stir to lossen any browned bits.  Add wine mixture to potato
  mixture.  Return to soup to a simmer. Cook for another 5 to 10
  minutes, until potatoes begin to fall apart and soup thickens.  Stir
  in curry powder and dry mustard. Remove soup from stove; stir in
  yogurt.  Return soup to stove; heat through.  Do not allow to boil.
  Ladle into hot soup plates; with grated lemon zest and cucumber
  slices. ( I would add instant potatoes to make thicker potato soup)

  nonfat yogurt.  Chop onion and potatoes into small dice.  Cook as
  directed until potatoes are just tender.  Add corn just before

   Substitute fructose in recipes calling for sugar. Since it is a
  natural sweetener there should be appreciable change in blood sugar
  levels.
   Fructose does not break down in cooking like some artificial
  sweeteners.
   General rule of thumb is to use 1/3 less fructose thatn the amount of
  sugar called for. It can be used in all diets,but diabetics should
  check with their doctors if there's any doubt about using it.

  1 1/2 lb Potatoes; peeled                    4 tb Milk;
      1 lb White fish fillet;                       Grated peel of 1/2 lemon;
           Salt; (to taste)                    2 tb Parsly; fresh chopped
           Grd white or black pepper;          1 ts Anchovy extract(optional)
           -Freshly                            3 tb All-purpose flour;
      2 tb Butter;                             2 tb Oil
 
  Cut the potatoes into chunks and place then in a saucepan with enough
  water to cover, adding a little salt if liked.  Heat until just about
  to boil. Meanwhile, lay the fish on a plate or dish to cover the
  saucepan and cover it with a second plate, lid or foil.  Put the fish
  on the pan when the water is boiling, then reduce the heat so water
  does not froth over. Cook the potatoes until tender-10-15 minutes if
  the chucks are faily small. Set the aside, without uncovering it.
  Drain and mash the potatoes, beating the well until smooth.  Mix in
  the butter, milk, lemon peel, parsley and anchovy extract, is used
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a quicke dish or baking pan.
  Pour any cooking juices from the fish into the potato mixture.  Flake
  the flash off the skin, discarded any bones, and at it to the
  potatoes.  Mix well, adding seasoning to taste. Use a large spoon to
  place the fish mixture in a mound on the prepared dish or pan but do
  not flatten it until it is all in mounded up. Flatten the top of the
  mixture sightly, then sprinkle it with a little of the flour.  Use a
  spatula and slice to flatten the mixture into a little neat circle,
  about 7" across.  Pat the sides with the knife and the top with slice
  to that the mixture is even and neatly shaped, keep sprinkling with
  the flour to coat the outside evenly. Trickle the oil over the fish
  cake and bake it for about 30 minutes, until well browned.  Cut into
  wedges to serve.

  leave to cool for 5 minutes.
  Stir cheese into the cocoa, then mix in the artificial sweetener to

  saccharine as they make the spread very bitter.

      Title: Chicken Biriani
 Categories: Diabetic, Poultry, Main dish, Rice, Curries
      Yield: 4 nice folks
 
      2 lg Onion; peeled                       6    Green Cardamoms;
      2 cl Garlic; crushed                     1    Cinnamon stick;
      2    Inch piece gingerroot; fresh        2 c  Brown basmati rice; L-grain
           -peeled                                  -If basmati is not available
      2 tb Curry powder;                            -=OR=-
      1 ts Turmeric;                           2 c  Ordinary brown rice;
      4 tb Natural yogurt;                 3 1/4 c  Water
           Salt to taste                            Lemon Wedges; to serve
           Fresh gournd pepper to taste             Fresh coriander; to serve
 
  Thinly slice 1 onion and set it aside.  Cut the other onion into
  chunks, then puree it to a paste with the garlic, gingerroot, curry
  powder, turmeric and yogurt.  If you do not have a blender or food
  processor, then grate the onion and gingerroot and mix with the other
  ingrededients.  Add plenty of seasoning, then spoon this mixture over
  the chicken thighs, spreading it evenly over them and turning to coat
  all sides.  Cover and chill for 1-24 hours, the longer the better.
  Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan or flameproof
  casserole. Add the sliced onion, bay leaves and cardamoms, then cook,
  stirring often, until browned-about 20 minutes.  Use a slotted spoon
  to remove half the onion from the pan and reserve for garnih.  Push
  the rest of the onion to one side.
  Add chicken portions, reserving the juices from marinating and brown
  them all over.  Add the rice to the pan, sprinkling it down between
  the chicken.  Tuck the cinnamon stick in between the chicken, then
  scrape all the marinating juice into the pan.  Pour in 3 3/4 cups of
  water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover pan tightly.
  Leave to gently for 30-35 minutes, until the rice has absorbed the
  water and the chicken is tender.  The biriani should be moist.
  Transfer the birmani to a serving dish, or serve it from the cooking
  pan, sprinkling the reserved onion over and addin flavor.  Add lemon
  wedges for garnish-their juice should be squeezed over before the
  birani is eaten.

  From Murray V.F. Jones of the New Zealand Diabetes Association "Make
  sure that the eggs are fresh and at room temperature," he cautions.
  "Try kiwi fruit", he suggests, as a garnish. You'll need a piece of
  kitchen parchment.
  
  1. In a bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the sweetener and
  salt, and continue beating. Beat in the cornstarch, vanilla and
  vinegar until soft peaks form. Work quickly, and take care not to
  overbeat.
  
  2. Rinse a piece of kitchen (grease proof) parchment with water.
  Place on a baking pan.
  
  3. Pile the egg white mixture onto the parchment in a 1 1/2 inch high
  circle. Bake at 250F for 1 hour or until firm.
  
  4. Remove from oven and cool in the pan. Invert on a platter and peel
  off paper. Peel and slice the kiwis crosswise into circles, leave
  some round or cut some in half. Arrange in attractive designs on the
  pavlova. Cut in four portion. Serve cold.

           Dumplings, recipe follows      
 
  Directions for Chicken and Dumplings: Disjoint chicken and remove
  skin; place in large pan. Add water, salt, celery, and onion; simmer
  1 to 2 hours or until meat is tender. Remove chicken from bone;
  return chicken to chicken stock. Bring chicken and stock to a boil;
  add rolled dumplings. Cover and boil gently 8 to 10 minutes.
  
  Directions for making rolled dumplings: Combine flour, baking powder,
  and salt.  Cut in shortening. Add milk to make a stiff dough. Roll
  dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness and cut into 1 inch strips,
  squares or diamonds.

  rolled pastry dough to fit, making several slashes in the top. The
  top crust would add calories to the total. You may add peas, carrots,
  mushrooms if you like.  Those ingredients are not in the original

      Title: Halibut Creole(Cod May Be Used Instead)
 Categories: Diabetic, Fish, Main dish
      Yield: 1 serving
 
  1 1/4 lb 2 lbs Halibut Steaks;             1/2 c  Green pepper; finely chopped
           Salt                              1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
           Freshly ground pepper               6 tb Butter; (yah. right.)
      3 lg Tomatoes; peeled, seeded            3 tb Lemon juice
           -and chopped                      1/8 ts Tabasco
 
  (For a six oz (raw) steak, I used 2 small Tomatoes, kept the green
  pepper and onion the same, threw in a chopped jalopena pepper,
  replaced the 6 tbsp of butter with 1 tsp margarine, and used about a
  tsp of Tabasco).
  
  Preheat the oven to 400F. Butter a shallow baking dish large enough
  to hold the fish in one layer, and place the fish in it. Season with
  salt and pepper to tasted and spread the tomatoes, green pepper, and
  onion over the top. Melt the butter with the lemon juice and Tabasco
  and drizzle it over the fish and vegetables. Bake about 25 minutes,
  basting with pan juices every 10 minutes.
  
  (My way, without the butter, with a 4 oz (cooked) portion of the
  fish, and about two-thirds of the vegetables, I counted it as 4
  protein choices and 1 Fruit/Vegetable choice).

      Title: Dick Miale Pizza
 Categories: Diabetic, Pasta, Pies, Vegetables, Cheese
      Yield: 4 sweet ones
 
      3 c  Unbleached white flour;             2 c  Water
      2 c  Cracked wheat flour;                1 ts Salt;
      2 pk Yeast;                         
 
  Most rustic types of bread consist of just flour, yeast, water and
  salt. I usually vary mine using a cracked wheat and also semolina
  flour. It seems to give the bread character. When I was under a
  Neurosurgeon, we were talking about sugars in the American diet and
  he said in Iran, the bread was made with out any sugars. I don't use
  a bread machine either. I bake mine on unglazeed quarry tiles and
  throw ice cubes in the bottom when I put the bread in. Gives it a
  nice rustic flavor and appearance. Sunday I made Pizza using 3 cups
  unbleached white flour and 2 cups cracked wheat flour along with 2
  pks yeast, 2 cup water and 1 tsp salt. (no fats-no sugar) Put veggies
  on the top, using fresh tomatoes. It made to large rounds. Again the
  only fat was the pam on the bottom and Pam on the top plus 1 Tbs.
  grating cheese for both pizzas. Worked out to be about 1/2 veggie and
  2 bread for 2 slices. Tasted a heck of a lot better than some of the
  commercial pizzas.

  2 1/4 c  Milk                                2 c  Quick cooking oats
    1/4 c  Margarine or butter                 1 tb Caraway seeds
    1/4 c  Sugar                          
 
  The number of slices used to calculate the recipe was not given or
  checked. Guessed about 16 half-inch slices per loaf to make 32
  servings.
  
  Stir together 2 cups of flour and the salt in a large bowl.  Heat the
  milk, margarine and sugar together over low heat until the margarine
  is soft. Add the liquid to the flour.  Beat for 2 minutes on the
  medium speed of an electric mixer or 300 strokes by hand.
  
  Combine 1 cup of flour and the yeast.  Add to the batter.  Beat for 2
  minutes on medium speed or 300 strokes by hand.  Stir in the oats and
  caraway with a wooden spoon.  Stir in enough additional flour to make
  a stiff dough.
  
  Turn out onto a floured board.  Knead until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes.
  Place in a greased large bowl.  Brush the top with vegetable oil.
  Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until
  double in size, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch the dough down.  Divide it in half and shape to form two loaves.
  Place in two greased 8 1/2 " x 4 1/2 " loaf pans.  Brush with melted
  margarine or butter.  Cover and let rise until nearly double in size,
  about 1 hour.  When almost doubled, preheat the oven to 375 F.  Bake
  for about 40 minutes or until brown.  Cool before slicing.  Makes 2
  loaves.

  * In the two Diabetic spaghetti squash recipes that I found, the
  spaghetti squash ingredient was about 1 1/2 for 4 serving or sweet
  ones. -=NO=-
  
  1.Prick the squash in 3 or 4 places with the tines of a fork. Place
  it on a microwave-safe plate, cover loosely with microwave-safe
  plastic wrap, and cook at full power (650-700 watts) for 9 minutes.
  Turn the squash over, and cook another 9 minutes. Then let it stand,
  still covered, for 5 minutes. 2. Using a sharp knife, cut a small X
  in the bottom of each tomato. Arrange the tomatoes on a
  microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Cook at full
  power for 4 minutes. 3. Let the tomatoes stand for 1 minute. Then
  peel, core and coarsely chop. Pour off the excess liquid. 4. Place 1
  T of the olive oil on a small microwave-safe plate and cook at full
  power for 2 minutes. Then stir in garlic and cook until it is crisp,
  3-4 minutes. 5. Halve the squash and scrape out the seeds. Using a
  fork, scoop out the pulp and transfer the spaghetti-like strands to a
  2-1/2 quart microwave-safe casserole. Add the tomatoes, garlic and
  oil, salt, pepper and remaining 2 T olive oil; toss well. Top with
  the mozzarella, parmesan and scallions. 6. Cook at full power until
  heated through, 4 minutes. Serve with additional parmesan on the side.

      Title: What Is an Usa Food Exchange
 Categories: Diabetic, Info/help
      Yield: 1 info/help
 
 
  What is an USA Food Exchange?
  
  It's like trading  5 pennies for 1 nickel or 10 dime for a dollar
  bill. Right!  Okay.  In food exchanges, you may exchanges one
  measurement or amount of food for another food in the same group, ie,
  if by change, such as I do...I have a 1/2 grapefruit every
  morning...let's say I ran out! I would look over the fruit exchange
  list to see what was there that I could have from the exchange group
  of the fruit list...then I could choose something from the fruit
  exchange.. Ah! Ha! I see I can sneak one of Bert's orange's. (2 1/2"
  across)= 1/2 cup fresh fruit.
  
  The Food Exchange System is based on six exchanges lists: Starch/bread
  exchange, meat, vegetables, fruits, milk, and fats.  There is also
  some special lists.  Foods are grouped within each list on the basis
  of similar amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat.  For example,
  one fruit exchange is CHO: 15g, PRO: 0g; FAT: 0g; CAL: 60;  This
  equivalent to 1/2 cup of grapefruit juice, but only a 1/3 cup of
  prune juice because prune juice has more sugar then grapefruit juice.
  Keep in mind that there will be some surprises.  Corn, for example,
  is a vegetable, but it appears on the starch/bread list.  That is
  because corn is starchy and its carbohydrate value is much closer to
  bread then to most vegetables. Foods from the starch/bread list is
  sometimes called STARCH EXCHANGE and sometimes called the  BREAD
  EXCHANGE---but they mean the same thing.

      Title: Diabetic Info on Usa Food Exchanges
 Categories: Diabetic, Info/help
      Yield: 1 info/help
 
 
  List 1: Starch/Bread Exchange.  Each item in this list contains
  approzimately 15 grams of carbohydate, 3 grams of protein, a trace of
  fat, and 80 calories.  You can choose your Strach Exchanges from any
  items on this list.  If you want to eat a Strach food that is not on
  this on this list...the general rule is that:
  
  1/2 cup of cereal, grain, or pasta is one serving.
  1 ounce of a bread product is one serving. (about 1 slice)
  
  List 2:  Meat Exchanges.   Each serving of meat and substitutes on
  this contains about 7 grams protein.  The amount of fat and number of
  calories vary, depending on what kind of meat or substitute you
  choose. There is 3 parts based on the amount of fat & calories.  LEAN
  MEAT, MEDIUM-FAT MEAT, & HIGH-FAT MEAT.
  =============================================================
  LEAN MEAT       CAR: 0  PROTEIN 7g FAT: 3g  CALORIES: 55
  MEDIUM-FAT MEAT CAR: 0  PROTEIN 7g FAT: 5g  CALORIES: 75
  HIGH-FAT  MEAT: CAR: 0  PROTEIN 7g FAT: 8g  CALORIES: 100
  ==============================================================
  List 3: Vegetable Exchange: List contains about 5 grams of
  carbohydrate, 2 grams protein, and about 25 calories: Unless other
  wise noted, the serving size for vegetables (1 Vegetable Exchange) is:
  
  1/2 cup of cooked vegetables or vegetable juice. -=OR=-
  1 cup of raw vegetables.
  
  List 4: Fruit Exchanges: List contains about 15 grams of
  carbohydarate and about 60 calories.
  
  1/2 cup of fresh fruit or fruit juice -=OR=-
  1/4 cup of dried fruit.
  
  List 5: Milk Exchange: Each serving of milk or milk products on this
  list contains about 12 grams of carbohydrate and 8 grams of protein.
  List is divided into 3 parts based on the amount of fat and calories:
  skim/very low-fat milk milk, low-fat milk and whole milk.
  ===================================================================
  Skim/very low-fat  CAR: 12g   PROTEIN: 8   FAT: TRACE  CALORIES: 90
  (This is like a skim milk or any other skim/very low-fat)
  Low-fat            CAR: 12g PROTEIN: 8   FAT: 5 CALORIES: 120
  (This is like a 2% milk)
  Whole              CAR: 12 PROTEIN: 8   FAT: 8      CALORIES: 150
  (This is like plain old whole milk)
  ======================================================================
  = List 6: Fat Exchanges: Fat list contains about 5 grams of fat and 45
  calories.  The foods in the fat list contain mostly fat, although
  some item may also contain a small amount of protein.  All fats are
  in calories and should be carefully measured. We all should eat
  unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats.
  
  Free foods: A free food is any food or drink that contains a fewer
  than 20 calories per serving.  You can eat as much as you want of
  those items that have no serving size specified.  You may eat two or
  three servings per day of those items that have a specific serving
  size.   Be sure to spread them out through the day.

  enjoy).

    3/4 c  Shortening or margarine             2    Eggs, beaten
  1 1/4 c  Leftover mashed potatoes       
 
  Dissolve yeast in water; set aside. In a saucepan, combine milk,
  shortening, and potatoes; cook and stir over low heat just until
  shortening is melted. Remove from the heat and place in a large bowl
  with sugar, salt, 2 cups of flour and the yeast mixture. Add eggs;
  mix well. Cover loosely and allow to stand for 2 hours (the dough
  will be like a sponge). Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
  a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth
  and elastic, about 6 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once
  to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled,
  about 1 hour. Punch down and divide into thirds. On a floured surface
  roll each portion into a 12 inch circle. Cut each circle into 12 pie
  shape wedges. Beginning at the wide end, roll up each wedge. Place
  rolls, point side down, on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise
  30 minutes or until nearly doubled. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 15
  minutes or until golden. Yield: 3 dozen.

  place until doubled, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Once the dough has doubled, knead in the raisin mixture and almonds.
  Knead until well mixed.  Roll the dough into a rectangular 12- by
  6-inch shape. Roll up jelly roll fashion.  Place on a lightly-oiled
  baking sheet and let rise about 30 minutes.  Bake in a 375-degree
  oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown.

  skin and bones. Set cod aside.

  carrots, celery, and saffron threads.  Bring the stock to a simmer.
  Simmer for about 1 hour, skimming the surface as necessary.Remove and
  reserve the stewing hen until cool enough to handle; then pick the
  meat from the bones. Cut into neat little pieces. Strain the saffron
  broth through a fine sieve. (Note: The soup can be made through this
  step in advance. Simply refrigerate broth and diced chicken meat for
  2 to 3 days, or freeze the broth and the chicken meat in separate
  convenient sized containers. Be sure to label and date them.  To use,
  defrost, remove congealed fat, return the broth full boil, and add
  the diced meat. Continue with recipe.) Add the corn, celery, parsley,

  1 1/2 lb Small red new potatoes            1/2 sm Red onion; thinly sliced and
           -unpeeled                                -separated into rings
      1    Green pepper; seeded and          1/2 c  Pitted ripe black olives
           -sliced crosswise into rings             -sliced in half crosswise
      4    Hard-boiled eggs                  1/4 c  Parsley; minced

MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Plain low-fat yogurt            1 1/2 ts Dijon mustard
      3 T  Fresh; dill snipped               1/2 ts Sugar
      1 T  Fresh lemon juice                 1/4 ts Salt; optional
      1 T  Lemon juice                       1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 T  Olive oil                      
 
  Steam the unpeeled potatoes until they are just tender when pierced
  with a fork, but not mushy.  If they are very small, leave them
  whole, or, when cool enough to handle, cut them in half or quarters
  with a very sharp knife, taking care not to pull off the skin. Place
  them in a large bowl, or on a serving platter surrounded by the green
  pepper rings.
  
  Slice the eggs crosswise, but remove and discard two of the yolks.
  Arrange the slices over the potatoes.  Add the onion rings and
  olives, and sprinkle the salad with the parsley.  In a small bowl,
  combine the dressing ingredients.  Pour the dressing over the salad.
  Either serve the salad as is, or toss it gently.  The salad may be
  served at room temperature or chilled.  Source:  Jane Brody's Good
