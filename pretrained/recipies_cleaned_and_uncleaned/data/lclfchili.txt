Black Bean Chili From Katherine Smith

chili, low fat

1 lb black turtle beans
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1 tablespoon oregano
2 cup onion; chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup red bell pepper; chopped
1 cup green bell pepper; chopped
4  jalapeno chiles; seeded and minced
1 tablespoon garlic; minced
2  bay leaves
2 teaspoon epazote; crushed (optional)
12 oz beer
28 oz can crushed tomatoes with puree
6 oz can tomato paste
5 tablespoon ground red chile
2 teaspoon salt
1 lb top sirloin steak; grilled or broiled and cu
1/4 cup cilantro; minced

Sort through beans and discard any stones. Wash beans in a sieve
under cold running water. Put beans in a pot with 6 cups water. Bring
to a boil and simmer 3 minutes. Turn off heat, cover and let soak 1
hour. Return to heat and bring to a simmer; cook 1 hour.

Meanwhile, toast the cumin seeds in a small pan until they become
fragrant, about 2 minutes. Then add the oregano and toast for 1
minute. Be careful not to burn. Pulverize the seeds and oregano in a
spice grinder. Saute the onion in the olive oil for 5 minutes, then
add the bell peppers, jalapenos and garlic. Saute 5 minutes longer
until the vegetables are quite wilted. Add the spices and half the
beer. Simmer until the beer is reduced by a third. Add remaining beer.

When the beans are just tender but not falling apart, add the
vegetable-beer mixture, the tomato puree and paste, and the chile
powder. Simmer 1 hour, then add salt to taste and the sirloin cubes;
simmer 15 minutes longer. Ladle into serving bowls and garnish with
minced cilantro.

Chili ( Lamb & Black Bean )

main dish, soups, low cal, low fat

1 1/2 lb lean ground lamb

1/4 teaspoon hot sauce
1  cilantro sprigs (optional)

When I'm in the mood for chili, this is the recipe I turn to. We
printed it back in 1989, and, in my opinion, it can't be equaled. The
only ingredient I don't usually have on hand is the ground lamb, but
you can use ground beef instead, and it still delivers. - Associate

Tex-Mex Turkey Chili

low cal, chili, turkey, ethnic

      ----LIZ JONES VXRF36B----
2  turkey thighs
1 cup boiling water
28 oz tomatoes with liquid
2  large onions; chopped
3  green peppers; seeded/chopped
2  garlic cloves; minced
2 teaspoon chili powder; or more
1 1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1  salt & fresh-ground pepper
1/4 cup extra sharp shredded cheese; cheddar, jack, optional

Put turkey thighs on a chopping board; slice meat away from the
bones. Cut meat in 1-inch cubes, discard skin. Spray a non-stick pot
(or pressure cooker) with cooking spray for no-fat frying. Add cubed
meat. Brown over moderate heat in its own melted fat (no added oil
needed). Remove from flame and stir boiling water into juices in pot.
Pour liquid into a cup, set aside until fat rises to surface. With a
bulb-type baster, skim off and discard surface fat.  Return
fat-skimmed liquid to pot. (Bones may be added for flavor and removed
before serving.) Add all remaining ingredients except cheese.  Cover,
