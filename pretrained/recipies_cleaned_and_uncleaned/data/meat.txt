  450 g/1 lb shortcrust pastry 1 egg white, beaten until liquid 450 g/1 lb
  boned breasts of chicken, pigeon or wild duck and/or saddle of hare or
  rabbit (not stewing meat) Salt and black pepper 450 g/1 lb minced beef 2
  tablespoons shredded suet 3 hard-boiled egg yolks, crumbled Spice mixture
  made with 1/4 teaspoon each ground cinnamon and mace and a pinch of ground
  cloves 25 g/1 oz stoned cooking dates, chopped 25 g/1 oz currants 50 g/2 oz
  stoned prunes, soaked and drained 125 ml/4 fl oz/ 1/2 cup beef stock 1
  tablespoon rice flour or cornflour
  
  No Christmas feast in medieval times was complete without a 'grete pye'. In
  some recipes, it could contain many varied meats, but quite often only two
  or three different kinds were suggested; change the meats suggested here if
  you wish.
  
  Use just over half the pastry to line a 23-cm/9-inch pie plate. Brush the
  inside with some of the egg white.
  
  Skin the pieces of breast and other meat if necessary and parboil them
  gently in salted water for 10-15 minutes.  Drain and leave to cool. Mix
  together in a bowl the minced beef, suet, salt and pepper to taste, the egg
  yolks and half the spice mixture.  Add the rest of the spices to the dried
  fruit in another bowl.  Slice the parboiled meat. Pre-heat the oven to
  220C/425F/Gas Mark 7.
  
  Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of the beef stock to the rice flour or cornflour in
  a small saucepan and cream them together; then add the remaining stock and
  stir over gentle heat until slightly thickened. Keep aside.
  
  Cover the bottom of the pastry case with half the mince mixture. Arrange
  the sliced meat in a flat layer on top.  Scatter the chopped spiced fruit
  over it and cover with the remaining mince.  Pour the thickened stock over
  the lot.
  
  Roll out the remaining pastry into a round to make a lid for the pie. Brush
  the rim of the case with a little more egg white and cover with the lid.
  Press the edges to seal, and make escape slits for steam. Decorate with the
  pastry trimmings and glaze with egg white.  Bake for 15 minutes, then
  reduce the heat to 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 and bake for 45-50 minutes longer.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

      Title: Andouille
 Categories: Meat, Makemeat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2    Yards large sausage casing,
           -approximately  (about 2-3
           -inches wide)
      4 lb Lean fresh pork
      2 lb Pork fat
  3 1/3 tb Finely minced garlic
      2 tb Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black
           -pepper
    1/8 ts Cayenne
    1/8 ts Chili powder
    1/8 ts Mace
    1/8 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1 tb Paprika
    1/4 ts Ground bay leaf
    1/4 ts Sage
      5 ts Colgin's liquid hickory
           -smoke
 
  Andouille was a great favorite in nineteenth-century New Orleans. This
  thick Cajun sausage is made with lean pork and pork fat and lots of garlic.
  Sliced about 1/2 inch thick and grilled, it makes a delightful appetizer.
  It is  also used in a superb oyster and andouille gumbo popular in Laplace,
  a Cajun  town about 30 miles from New Orleans that calls itself the
  Andouille   Capital of the World.
  
  (about 6 pounds of 20 inch sausage, 3 to 3 1/2 inches thick)
  
  Soak the casing about an hour in cold water to soften it and to loosen the
  salt in which it is packed.  Cut into 3 yard lengths, then place the narrow
  end of the sausage stuffer in one end of the casing. Place the wide end of
  the stuffer up against the sink faucet and run cold water through the
  inside of the casing to remove any salt. (Roll up the casing you do not
  intend to use; put about 2 inches of coarse salt in a large jar, place the
  rolled up casing on it, then fill the rest of the jar with salt. Close
  tightly and refrigerate for later use.)
  
  Cut the meat and fat into chunks about 1/2 inch across and pass once
  through the coarse blade of the meat grinder.  Combine the pork with the
  remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Cut
  the casings into 26 inch lengths and stuff as follows: Tie a knot in each
  piece of casing about 2 inches from one end.  Fit the open end over the tip
  of the sausage stuffer and slide it to about 1 inch from the wide end. Push
  the rest of the casing onto the stuffer until the top touches the knot.
  (The casing will look like accordion folds on the stuffer.) Fit the stuffer
  onto the meat grinder as directed on the instructions that come with the
  machine, or hold the wide end of the stuffer against or over the opening by
  hand. Fill the hopper with stuffing. Turn the machine on if it is electric
  and feed the stuffing gradually into the hopper; for a manual machine, push
  the stuffing through with a wooden pestle.  The sausage casing will fill
  and inflate gradually.  Stop filling about 1 1/4 inches from the funnel end
  and slip the casing off the funnel, smoothing out any bumps carefully with
  your fingers and being careful not to push the stuffing out of the casing.
  Tie off the open end of the sausage tightly with a piece of string or make
  a knot in the casing itself. Repeat until all the stuffing is used up.
  
  To cook, slice the andouille 1/2 inch thick and grill in a hot skillet with
  no water for about 12 minutes on each side, until brown and crisp at the
  edges.

      Title: Aromatic Lamb
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Leg of lamb (about 4 lbs)
      3 lb Potatoes (about 5 oz each)
      1    Lemon (may be doubled)
           Honey
           Olive oil
           Butter
           Rosemary, thyme & oregano
 
  Put the leg of lamb into a large roasting pan.  Bruise the leaves of 2 or 3
  sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle them over the meat.  Add plenty of pepper
  and 1 tablespoon honey.  Rub the mixture into the meat with your hands.
  Then rub half a lemon over the joint, squeezing the juice on to the meat as
  you do so.  Do not add any salt. Leave to marinate for 4 to 24 hours.
      Peel and quarter the potatoes, then arrange them in a single layer
  round the lamb.  Squeeze lemon juice over the potatoes -- use at least half
  a lemon, or up to one and a half lemons for a strong citrus flavour.
  Carefully pour 1/4 pint water into a corner of the roasting pan, then
  sprinkle over the potatoes and lamb about 2 tablespoons chopped fresh
  rosemary, at least 1 teaspoon each fresh chopped thyme and oregano, and
  some salt and pepper.  Drizzle on 1-1/2 teaspoons honey and 1 tablespoon
  olive oil, then dot with 1 oz butter. Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 6 for
  a further 1 to 1-1/4 hours. The ingredients will become gilded and will
  burnish to a rich brown in places. Lift the meat and turn the potatoes
  occasionally, and if necessary, add a little boiling water to the pan to
  prevent drying out.

 Categories: Australian, Meat, Beef, Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Minced steak (ground beef)
           Fine chopped onion
        pn Mixed herbs
           Salt and pepper
           Gravy:
           Dripping (solid oil will
           Do)
           Plain flour
           Water from the meat mix
 
  Try this - minced steak (ground beef), some fine chopped onion, pinch of
  mixed herbs, salt and pepper to your taste. Boil in water until cooked.
  Make a gravy - melt a little dripping (solid oil will do). Mix in plain
  flour until all fat is absorbed (it becomes crumbly). Slowly add water from
  the meat mix and stir over low heat. Add water until it becomes a nice
  gravy mix. (As thick or thin as you like.) Mix this gravy in with the meat.
  That is your pie filling.

      Title: Baked Ham
 Categories: Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lb Country Ham
      1    Onion, peeled and quartered
      1    Carrot, quartered
      1    Stalk of Celery
      1 lb Bouquet Garni (see below)
      6    Peppercorns

---------------------------------FOR BAKING---------------------------------
    1/4 c  Dark Brown Sugar
    1/4 ts Ground Mace
      1    Orange Rind AND Juice
  1 1/2 c  Cider
           Watercress (for garnish)

-------------------------------BOUQUET GARNI-------------------------------
      3    Parsley sprigs
      1    Thyme sprig
      1    Bay leaf
 
  METHOD: Allow 1/2 to 1 lb. of ham per person, depending on the amount of
  bone included.  If the ham is heavily cured (like Virginia ham) immerse it
  for 4 hours in cold water and then drain.  If lightly cured, cook it
  without soaking.  Put the ham in a large saucepan with the vegetables,
  water to cover, bouquet garni and peppercorns.  Cover and simmer gently 1
  1/4 hours for a 2 lb. cut or 30 minutes per pound for cuts over 3 lbs. (20
  minutes per pound is enough for large hams over 10 lbs.).
  
  When the ham is cooked, drain it and peel away the skin.  This is easily
  done by carefully lifting corner of skim with a knife and pulling with the
  fingers.  If the ham is very hot, hold skin with a cloth or paper towel.
  Set ham in a baking pan, fat side upwards.
  
  Combine sugar, mace orange rind and juice to form a paste; spread over ham
  and pour cider around it.  Bake in a moderately hot oven (375øF) for 30
  minutes or until golden, basing often.
  
  WATCHPOINT: Wait until the sugar begins to brown on the ham before basting
  with cider.  You need to keep the ham moist.  But it's not too difficult to
  baste the lean part of ham and avoid sugared crust.
  
  Finish the top as follows:  if using an electric stove, caramelize the
  sugar crust by placing under a hot broiler for 5 to 7 minutes until crisp
  and brown.  If using a gas stove, heat two metal skewers in the flame until
  red hot.  Take each skewer in turn and hold lightly on the sugar crust to
  burn decorative lines.
  
  Arrange ham on a platter and if serving hot, let stand in a warm place 15
  minutes before serving to make caring easier.  If serving cold, allow ham
  to become completely cold before carving.  Garnish with watercress and
  serve with raisin or Cumberland sauce.
  
  NOTE:  Bouquet garni (a bunch of herbs) -- is traditionally made of
  parsley, thyme and bay leaf (tied together with string if used in liquids
  which are to be strained).  Otherwise herbs should be tied in a piece of
  cheesecloth for easy removal before serving the dish.  If you have no fresh
  thyme use 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme.

      Title: Barbecued Ribs, Missouri-Style
 Categories: Pork, Meat, Regional, Bbq
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Salt
      2 tb Ground cumin
      2 tb Chili powder
      2    Full racks pork spareribs
           -
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Ground black pepper
      4 tb Paprika
           -Basting Sauce (recipe
           -follows)
 
  Combine salt, sugar, cumin, pepper, chili powder and paprika to make
  barbecue rub. Rub ribs thoroughly with mixture. Place ribs on baking sheets
  and cook in 180-degree oven 3 hours. Do not turn; slow cooking infuses
  spices. Remove from oven. (Ribs may be covered and refrigerated up to 2
  days before grilling.) Use very low charcoal fire with rack set as high as
  possible. Grill ribs 5 minutes to 30 minutes per side, depending on heat
  and temperature of ribs. Ribs should have light outer crust and be heated
  throughout. (Longer cooking produces better ribs.) If you prefer juicy
  ribs, coat with Basting Sauce just before removing from grill. Otherwise
  serve dry with sauce on side. Remove ribs from grill, cut in between bones
  and serve. Makes 5 servings.
  
  Note: Recipe is easily halved or doubled. Keep 2:1 proportion of sauce to
  rub.
  
  Basting Sauce
  
  1 3/4 cups white vinegar      2 tbs hot pepper sauce 2 tbs sugar 1 tbs salt
  1 tbs ground black pepper

      Title: Basturma (Georgian Pomegranate Marinated Grilled Lamb)
 Categories: Asian, Meat, Bbq, Marinades
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Boneless leg of lamb
           For the marinade:
      2 c  Fresh pomegranate juice (or
      1 c  Pomegranate syrup)
      1 sm Onion, grated
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro,
           Plus
    1/4 c  For garnish
      1    Bay leaf, crushed
      1 ts Ground coriander
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Salt
           Lemon wedges for serving
 
  From: Nov/Dec issue On The Grill magazine For subscription information,
  send mail to OnTheGrill@aol.com
  
  In the Republic of Georgia, basturma is a sort of shish kebab (Elsewhere in
  the Near East, the term refers to spiced dried meat and is etymologically
  related to our word pastrami.) Georgians love the combination of fruit and
  meat with pomegranate juice as a common seasoning. If you can't find fresh
  pomegranates, use pomegranate syrup (sometimes called pomegranate
  molasses), which is sold in Middle East and Armenian markets. This recipe
  comes from my friend, Darra Goldstein, author of The Georgian Feast (Harper
  Collins).
  
  Serves 4
  
  Cut the lamb into 1 1/2-inch cubes, trimming off excess fat or sinew.
  (Leave a little fat intact.)
  
  Prepare the marinade.  To juice a fresh pomegranate, cut it in half and
  press it on a citrus reamer.  Strain juice into a large non-reactive bowl.
  Stir in the remaining marinade ingredients.  Add the lamb and marinate for
  at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.
  
  Thread lamb onto skewers and season with salt and pepper.  Build the fire
  and let it die down to embers. Oil the grill.  Rake a 1-inch layer of
  glowing coals beneath it. Generously season the kebabs with salt; grill,
  basting with any excess marinade, until the lamb is cooked to taste, 4 to 6
  minutes per side.  Transfer the kebabs to a platter, sprinkle with the
  remaining cilantro and serve with lemon wedges.

           -Keywords: marinade
      8 lb Venison/beef roast
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      1 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Red pepper
      1 ts Meat tenderizer

    1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce
    1/3 c  Soy sauce
    1/3 c  Barbecue sauce
    1/3 c  Liquid smoke
 
  Cut meat in thin slices. Meat is easier to cut when partially frozen and it
  will cut evenly. Combine salt, peppers, meat tenderizers, seasoned salt,
  accent, garlic and onion powders, kitchen bouquet, morton tender quick,
  worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, barbecue sauce and liquid smoke. Marinate
  meat in sauce for 24 hours in a sealable plastic bag. Place meat directly
  on oven racks, line bottom of oven with foil, or on rack in shallow pan and
  dry in oven for 6-8 hours on lowest setting. Continue to dry in warm oven
  if necessary. Oven's with pilot lights work especially well.

      Title: Beef Stroganoff
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Round steak or
           -other beef fillet
      8 oz Mushrooms (canned),
           -sliced
     12 oz Sour cream
      4 oz Wine, white
      2 tb Onion, chopped
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Nutmeg
      1 tb Chives, chopped
      1 ts Garlic, minced
           -(or more to taste)
           Salt
           Pepper
           Pasta (or steamed rice)
 
  Cut meat into strips about 1/2-inch thick by 2 inches long.  Saute the
  onions in butter until brown. Place meat in pan with onions. Sear quickly
  in frying pan along with onion. (This seals the juices inside.) Avoid
  overcooking the meat.
  
  Add mushrooms and stir in the wine, chives and garlic for about 5 minutes.
  Finally add sour cream, Worcestershire sauce and chives, and simmer until
  it almost boils. Serve on noodles or steamed white rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sumptuous beef stroganoff -- This easy recipe can be served either on
  steamed rice or on noodles.
  
  *  You may want to vary the thickness of the sauce.  I do this by adding
  sour cream to thicken, or adding wine to lighten.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 to 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  Core and remove the seeds from the red and green peppers. Cut peppers into
  thin strips, about 1.1/2 inches long. Slice the meat across the grain into
  thin strips 1.1/2 to 2 inches long. Place in a bowl and add the
  cornstarch, soy sauce and pepper flakes and 2 Tablespoons of the oil. (The

  let stand 15 minutes.
  
  Heat the remaining oil in a wok or skillet large enough to hold the
  ingredients. When the oil is very hot add the meat and cook, stirring
  about 30 seconds, until separated. Drain the meat in a sieve over a bowl
  to catch the drippings and reserve the oil. Wipe out the wok and return 2
  Tablespoons of the oil to it. Heat the oil and add the peppers, scallions
  and garlic. Cook over high heat until crisp and tender about 1 minute. Add
  the sugar, wine, chicken broth, and salt if desired. Add the beef and cook
  quickly, stirring, until just heated through. Serve immediately.

  Smoke an additional 2 hours. Cool by dunking in a pot of cool (not cold)
  water for about 5 minutes until it is cool to the touch. Dry the salami
  thoroughly and store it in the refrigerator. Note: Because we used cured
  meat in this recipe, there was no need for any other curing agents or

      Title: Blackened Pork Chops
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     18 ea 5 oz pork chops, 3/4" thick
    3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter (note

-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb + 2 tsp white pepper
      1 tb + 3/4 tsp black pepper
  2 1/2 ts Dry mustard
  2 1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      2 ts Garlic powder
    3/4 ts Dried thyme leaves
 
  NOTE:  The 3/4 pound (3 sticks) unsalted butter, must be kept melted and
  warm in the skillet. Let the chops come to room remperature before
  blackening.  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients thoroughly in a
  medium-size bowl.    Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat
  until it is extremely hot and just short of the point at which you see
  white ash or a white spot forming in the skillet bottom, about 8 minutes.
  (The time will vary according to the intensity of the heat source.)
     Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.    Just before cooking each
  chop, dip it in the melted butter so that both sides are well coated, then
  sprinkle each side generously and evenly with the seasoning mix (use
  between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoon on each side), patting it in with your hands.
  (If you lay the chop on a plate or other surface to season it, be sure the
  surface is warm so the butter won't congeal and stick to the surface
  instead of to the chop.  Wipe the surface clean after seasoning each chop.
  Use any remnaining seasoning mix in another recipe.) Immediately place the
  chop in the hot skillet.  If the chop is very lean, pour about 1 teaspoon
  butter on top.  (Be careful, as the butter may flame up.) If you cook more
  than 1 chop at a time, place each chop in the skillet before buttering and
  seasoning another one.
     Cook uncovered over the same high heat until the underside forms a
  crust, about 2 minutes (the time will vary according to the thickness of
  the chops and the heat of the skillet or fire). Turn the chops over and
  pour about 1 teaspoon more butter on top of each, if needed. Cook just
  until meat is done, about 2 minutes more. Serve the chops crustier side up
  while piping hot. Clean the skillet after cooking each batch and repeat the
  blackening procedure with the remaining chops. To serve, place 2 or 3 chops
  on each heated serving plate. If you use a serving plater, DO NOT STACK THE
  CHOPS. From The Prudhome Family Cookbook Some personal notes: If you do not
  have a heavy duty commercial range hood, capable of disposing of an
  incredible amount of smoke, DON'T cook this inside. If you live in an
  apartment, like I do, where your smoke detector is attached to a central
  fire system, you will very quickly become well known to all your neighbors,
  and your local firefighters. In all likelyhood you will also get to meet
  your landlord. A good, 40,000 BTU to 50,000 BTU barbecue will do a good job
  of providing sufficient heat.  Be sure you have all your doors and windows
  closed, and invite your neighbors to the barbecue. This method generates a
  totally unbelievable amount of smoke.
   However, the results are worth it.  Whatever you are cooking by this
  method, it is an entirely incredible taste experience. From Prudhomme
  Family Cookbook

      Title: Boudin Blanc (Ellen Cleary 1)
 Categories: Cajun, Meat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Three foot long lengths hog
           Sausage casing
      3 lb Boneless lean pork, trimmed
           Excess fat and cut into
  1 1/2    Inch chunks
      4 c  Coarsely chopped onions
      1    Mdm bay leaf, crumbled
      6    Whole black peppercorns
      5 ts Salt
      1 c  Coarsely chopped green
           Pepper
      1 c  Coarsely chopped parsley
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped green
           Onions
      1 tb Finely chopped garlic
      2    12 c freshly cooked white
           Rice
      1 tb Dried sage leaves
  2 1/2 ts Cayenne
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Place the sausage casing in a bowl.  Pour in enough warm water to cover it
  and soak for 2 - 3 hours, until it is soft and pliable.
  
  Meanwhile, put the pork in a heavy 4-5 quart casserole and add enough water
  to cover it by 1 inch.  Bring to a boil over high heat and skim off the
  foam and scum that rise to the surface. Add 2 c of onion, the bayleaf,
  peppercorns and 1 tsp salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially
  covered, for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  With a slotted spoon, transfer the chunks of pork to a plate. Put the pork,
  the remaining 2 c of onions, the green pepper, parsley, green onions and
  garlic through the medium blade of a food grinder and place the mixture in
  a deep bowl.  Add the rice, sage, cayenne and black pepper and the
  remaining 4 tsp of salt. Knead vigorously with both hands, then beat with a
  wooden spoon until the mixture is smooth and fluffy. Taste for seasoning.
  
  To make each sausage, tie a knot 3 inches from one end of a length of the
  casing.  Fit the open end over the funnel (or "horn") on the sausage making
  attachment of a meat grinder.  Then ease the rest of the casing onto the
  funnel, squeezing it up like the folds of an accordion.
  
  Spoon the meat mixture into the mouth of the grinder and, with a wooden
  pestle, push it through into the casing.  As you fill it, the casing will
  inflate and gradually ease away from the funnel in a ropelike coil. Fill
  the casing to within an inch or so of the funnel end but do not try to
  stuff it too tightly, or it may burst. Slip the casing off the funnel and
  knot the open end.  You may cook the sausages immediately or refrigerate
  them safely for five or six days.
  
  Before cooking a sausage, prick the casing in five or six places with a
  skewer or the point of a small sharp knife.  Melt 2 Tbsp of butter with 1
  Tbsp of oil in a heavy 12 inch skillet set over moderate heat. When the
  foam begins to subside, place the sausage in the skillet, coiling it in
  concentric circles. Turning the sausage with tongs, cook uncovered for
  about 10 minutes, or until it is brown on both sides.
  
  Boudin is the French term for the blood sausage, or "pudding," made with
  the blood of the pig.  Boudin blanc is a white sausage made with pork but
  no blood.  This Louisiana version adds rice and is even whiter.
  
  Makes 3 30" long sausages. From Ellen Cleary, Apr 15-91

  "Blood pudding is one of the great delicacies of Acadian cuisine. It used
  to be that every Acadian family made its own. Since the annual slaughter
  came during Advent, the boudin was usually saved for the Christmas
  holidays." Also part of Cajun cuisine,
  
  Sauce a boudin: When slaughtering a pig, collect the fresh blood,
  immediately add salt and stir to prevent coagulation. Cut the fresh pork,
  the lung, heart and neck into large pieces. Place the meat into a large pot
  and add just water to cover the meat. Add the salt and 3 chopped onions.
  Simmer on medium heat for 3 hours. Remove the meat from the cooking liquid
  and let it cool. Cut the meat into very small pieces or grind it with a
  meat grinder. Add the meat to the cooking liquid with the 2 remaining
  onions, pepper and spices. Bring the liquid to a boil and slowly add the
  blood by pouring it through a sieve. Stir constantly. Add the flour, mixed
  with a small amounts of water. (The flour may be browned in the oven before
  being add to the meat, provided that slightly more flour is used.) Simmer
  the mixture on low heat for approximately 1 hour, stirring frequently. This
  sauce may served later by warming in a skillet.
  
  Boudin des Branches (Blood Pudding Sausages): To make blood pudding
  sausages, prepare blood pudding sauce but do not simmer for the last half
  hour. Rather, clean the small intestines of the pig, cut them into 20 inch
  pieces at tie them at one end. Using a funnel or a piece of birch bark as
  was the Acadian tradition, fill the intestinal lining with the sauce until
  the intestine is three quarters full. press out the air and tie the other
  end, leaving some space for expansion. Put the branches (sausages) in
  boiling water and cook for 45 to 1 hour.

  6 x 1-cm/ 1/2-inch-thick slices venison fillet or haunch Bacon fat or lard
  for rubbing Pepper sauce for veal or venison to serve Basting Sauce: 350
  ml/12 fl oz/1 1/2 cups red wine 3 tablespoons oil 1/8 teaspoon ground
  ginger Salt and black pepper
  
  Venison fillet was the most prized cut.  It might be scored in lozenge
  shapes with a knife point or parboiled and larded with salt pork before
  being spit-roasted whole.  Modern farmed venison, however, seems to be
  tenderised better by being marinated.
  
  Combine all the basting sauce ingredients and soak the venison slices in
  the sauce for at least 2-3 hours; elderly meat will need longer. Pour off
  the sauce into a jug when you are ready to cook.  Put the meat on a board
  and pat it dry, then nick the edges of the slices and rub them all over
  with the fat.
  
  Thread the slices on skewers or lay them on a greased grill grid. Heat the
  grill to medium-high and grill the meat like steak until medium-rare or
  well done, as you wish.  (For well-done meat, reduce the temperature after
  searing both sides and cook slowly.)  Baste the meat with the reserved
  basting sauce while cooking and turn it once using a fish slice; do not
  prod it with a fork.  When done, transfer the slices to a warmed serving
  platter, and serve at once, with the hot Pepper Sauce in a sauce boat.

      Title: Brown 'n' Serve Sausage
 Categories: Meat, Diabetic
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 lb Lean ground pork
    1/4 c  Cracker crumbs
    1/4 c  Water
      1 ts Sage
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
      1 pn Ground cloves
 
  The two step cooking procedure ensures the removal of most of the fat.
  
  Combine ground pork and cracker crumbs.  Stir in water, sage, salt, thyme,
  oregano, pepper and cloves.  Mix until thoroughly combined.
  
  Divide into 12 portions.  Form each into a sausage-shaped roll or flat
  patty.  (Wet hands with cold water to make the job easy.)  Place in a cold,
  lightly oiled frypan.
  
  Cook over medium heat, turning often, about 4 min each side until just
  beginning to brown and pieces are no longer pink.
  
  Remove to paper towels and blot to absorb any fat.  Wrap.  Store in
  refrigerator up to 5 days or in freezer up to 2 months.  Or cook a second
  time and serve immediately.
  
  To serve:  Return sausages or patties to a clean, cold frypan.  Cook over
  medium heat, turning once or twice, about 4 min until sausages are brown
  and crisp.  (Cook frozen sausages in the same manner, allowing about 2 min
  longer for cooking.

  Suggestion for Pork Pies: Stir-cook the ground pork mixture in the frying
  pan, place it in a plastic colander to drain off most of the fat and blot
  with paper towels.  Spread the pork mixture in a baking dish (try 8"
  pyrex), add fat-free gravy if needed for liquid. Top with about 2 1/4 cups
  seasoned breadcrumbs.  Bake at 350-375 F until crumbs are lightly browned.

      Title: Cajun Lamb with Rice
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Boneless lamb sirloin
           -roast (approx. 2 lbs)
      2 tb Cooking oil
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      1    Red bell pepper,
           -diced
      1    Green bell pepper,
           -diced
      1 lb Tomatoes, sliced,
           -in puree
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Grated lemon peel
    1/2 ts Chili powder
      1 c  Rice

---------------------------------SPICE MIX---------------------------------
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 ts Paprika
    1/8 ts Garlic powder
 
  Trim the lamb of any excess fat.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix
  together the spice mix ingredients, and rub over the lamb. Let stand for 15
  minutes. Heat oil in a skillet. Sear the lamb until all sides are browned.
  Remove lamb to a roasting pan. Roast lamb for 35 to 40 minutes.
  
  While the lamb is cooking, add onions and peppers to the skillet used for
  searing the lamb.  Saute until soft.  Add tomatoes, chicken stock, basil,
  lemon and chili powder.  Bring to a boil and add the rice. Reduce heat and
  simmer until liquid is absorbed.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is a spicy lamb dish that I picked up originally from a local
  newspaper.  Yield:  serves 2-3.
  
  *  Often when boning a leg of lamb you end up with a very ragged piece of
  meat.  Just chop it up into boxy pieces and use more spice mix to cover all
  the surfaces.  You will be slicing up the roast before serving anyhow.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

      Title: Cajun Meat Loaf
 Categories: Ethnic, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
      2    Bay leaves; whole
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Pepper, cayenne; ground
      1 ts Pepper, black
    1/2 ts Pepper, white
    1/2 ts Cumin, ground
    1/2 ts Nutmeg, ground

------------------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS------------------------------
      4 tb Butter, unsalted
    3/4 c  Onion; finely chopped
    1/2 c  Pepper, green bell; chopped
    1/4 c  Onion, green; chopped fine
      2 ts Garlic; minced
      1 tb Tabasco sauce
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 c  Milk, evaporated
    1/2 c  Catsup
  1 1/2 lb Beef, lean ground
    1/2 lb Pork, ground
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 c  Bread crumbs, very fine
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. Melt
  the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, celery,
  bell peppers, green onions, garlic, tabasco, Worcestershire and seasoning
  mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking excessively, about 6 minutes,
  stirring occasionally and scraping the pan bottom well.
  
  Stir in the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to room
  temperature.
  
  Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Add
  the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the bay
  leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the pan,
  shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6 inches
  wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350ø F for 25 minutes, then
  raise heat to 400ø F and continue cooking until done, about 35 minutes
  longer.
  
  Serve immediately as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef. This is best
  using both ground pork and ground beef, as the pork gives more flavor
  diversity. However, you can make it with ground beef only.

  1 1/4 ts White pepper
    3/4 ts Ground cumin
    3/4 ts Dried thyme leaves
    3/4 c  Evaporated milk
      2 lb Potatoes, peeled & quartered
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts White pepper
  1 1/2 c  Julienned carrots (see note)
      1 c  Julienned onions  (see note)

--------------------------VEGETABLE SEASONING MIX--------------------------
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
    1/4 ts Onion powder
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper

---------------------------------VEGETABLES---------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Julienned zucchini (see note
      1 c  Julienned squash (see Note)
           Very Hot Cajun Sauce/Beef
 
  NOTE:  To julienne squashes, cut peelings 1/8 inch thick and cut these into
  strips 1/8 inch wide and 2 inches long; use only strips that have skin on
  one surface. Cut carrots and onions into similar strips.
     In a 13x9-inch ungreased baking pan, combine the beef and pork. Mix in
  the eggs and bread crumbs by hand until thoroughly mixed. Set aside. In a
  1-quart saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons of the butter, the onions, celery,
  bell peppers, garlic, Worcestershire, Tabasco and meat seasoning mix. Saute
  over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring frequently and scraping the pan
  bottom well.  Remove from heat and cool. Add the sauteed vegetable mixture
  and 1/4 cup of the milk to the meat and mix well by hand.
   Form into a 12x8-inch loaf and center in the pan.
   Bake at 450F until brown on top, about 30 minutes.
   Remove from oven; pour off drippings, reserve 2-1/2 tablespoons. Set meat
  and drippings aside.
     Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until fork tender; drain, reserving about 1
  cup of the water.  Place the potatoes, while still hot, in a large mixing
  bowl with the remaining 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup milk, the salt and white
  pepper.  Stir with a wooden spoon until broken up, then beat with a metal
  whisk (or electric mixer with a paddle) until creamy and velvety smooth.
   (NOTE: Mix in some of the reserved potato water if potatoes are not creamy
  enough.)  In a large skillet (preferably non-stick) combine the reserved
  drippings with the carrots, onions and vegetable seasoning mix; saute over
  high heat 1-1/2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the zucchini and yellow
  squash and continue sauteing until vegetables are noticeably brighter in
  color, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.
     Mound undrained vegetables on top of the meat loaf, away from the edges.
  Layer the mashed potatoes evenly over the top of the vegetables and top
  edges of the meat, using all the potatoes. Bake at 525F until brown on top,
  about 8 to 10 minutes.  Serve immediately with about 1/2 cup Very Hot Cajun
  Sauce (see recipe) under each serving. From Paul Prudhommes "Louisiana
  Kitchen"

      Title: Calf's Brains with Capers
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Sets calf's brains; prepped
           Flour
      2 tb Butter
           Salt and pepper to taste
           Paprika
           Rosemary
      2 tb Capers
    1/4 c  Dry white wine
 
  Prepare brains;  after skinning them, dry between paper towels.  Cut into
  1/2-inch slices and spread on dry towel, then sprinkle with flour on all
  sides.  Be sure they are quite dry and not gummy.
  
  When butter is sizzling in the skillet, add the brain slices.  Brown on
  each side and sprinkle with salt, pepper, paprika, and a pinch of rosemary.
  If the butter becomes absorbed, add a little more so that enough of it
  surrounds the slices of brains and becomes slightly brown. Now add capers
  with a little of their own juice, then the wine. When everything is
  bubbling, serve.

  as much fat as possible plus that white membrane. Don't remove all the
  membrane, however, as something has to hold them together.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Pepper
      1 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Onion powder
  1 1/4 c  Flour
      3 lb Chicken; cut up
      1 c  Oil
      1 lb Andouille or smoked sausage;
           .  cut into 1/2-inch pieces
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      1 c  Bell pepper; chopped
      3 cl Garlic; finely chopped
      1 c  Okra; chopped
      8 c  Chicken stock
      1 tb Paprika
      1 tb File
      4 c  Rice; cooked
 
  Mix 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion
  powder; rub on the chicken pieces. Set the chicken pieces aside for 30
  minutes.
  
  Place 1/2 cup flour in a bag; add the chicken pieces and shake well to coat
  the chicken. Using 1/2 cup of oil, fry the chicken in a heavy skillet until
  crust is brown on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken and
  drain.
  
  In the same pan, saute the sausage until browned. Remove from the heat,
  drain and reserve with the chicken.
  
  Mix 3/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup of oil in a large, heavy-bottom saucepan over
  medium heat and stir to mix. Continue cooking and stirring until the roux
  is a dark chocolate brown. This can take 30 minutes. Do not cook on too
  high of a heat. If it begins to cook too fast, remove from the heat and
  continue to stir.
  
  Add chopped vegetables and stir thoroughly. Mixture will be sticky. Cook
  for about 5 minutes. (Adding the vegetables stops the browning process.)
  Add the chicken stock 1 cup at a time until it is well blended. Add the
  remaining seasonings, paprika, file, chicken pieces and sausage. Simmer for
  1 1/2 hours. Serve over rice.
  
  Makes about 8 servings.

      3 lb Chicken meat-15% fat
      1 tb Onion powder
      1 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Finely fround coriander
    1/2 ts Dried marjoram
    1/2 ts Ground mace
    1/2 ts Finely ground mustard seed
      1 ts Paprika
      1 ts Fine grind white pepper
      1 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
 
  Prepare casings. Mix the remaining ingredients together. If you desire a
  sausage like texture, grind through the fine disk twice and stuff. If you
  desire a texture more like commercial hot dogs, process a third at a time
  in a food processor until it has a thick puree like consistency. The result
  is harder to stuff, but seems more like a "real" hot dog. Tie off into 5"
  lengths. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the links, without
  separating them, immediately reduce the heat and simmer very gently for 30
  minutes. Remove and place in ice water. chill thoroughly. Remove, pat dry,
  and refrigerate up to a week or freeze.

      Title: Chicken Fried Steak with Cream Gravy
 Categories: Meat, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Round Steak, Cut About
      1    Inch Thick (About 2 lbs)
      2 lg Eggs
      2 tb Milk
    1/4 c  Unbleached Flour
           Salt And Freshly Ground
           Pepper, To Taste
      2 tb Butter Or Margarine
      1    Recipe  Cream Gravy (See
           Below)
 
  One of the old standbys, this was served in many of the roadside diners
  that catered to truck drivers.  It soon became a favorite of just about
  everybody.
  
  Cut the steak crosswise into 4 serving pieces.  Place one piece between two
  sheets of plastic wrap then using a rolling pin or meat pounder, pound to a
  1/4-inch thickness.  Repeat with the remaining pieces. In a pie plate, beat
  the milk and eggs together, in a second pie plate combine the flour and the
  seasonings together.  Dip each piece of steak first into the egg mixture
  then into the flour mixture, coating completely. Shake gently to remove the
  excess flour mixture. Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet, using medium
  heat, fry the steaks, two at a time, about 5 minutes on a side or until
  golden brown on each side. Serve with biscuits and cream gravy. From: Dave

 Categories: Meat, Condiments
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
    1/4 c  Dry sherry (cooking
           -sherry will do)
      2 tb Light soy sauce
    1/4 c  Dark soy sauce
  2 1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 c  Hoisin sauce
      1 ts Curry powder
    1/4 c  Pineapple juice,
           -unsweetened (or use
           -the juice from the
           -can of pineapple chunks)
    1/2 ts White pepper
      2 tb Ginger root, cut into
           -thin (1/8-inch) slices

--------------------------------MEAT SKEWERS--------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Sirloin tip
     12 oz Pineapple chunks
 
  Combine the ingredients for the marinade; stir well.
  
  Cut meat into bite-size chunks and place on skewers with 2 or 3 chunks of
  pineapple in between the meat pieces.  Marinate the skewers overnight, in a
  covered container, in the refrigerator.
  
  To cook, broil the meat for about 10 minutes (depends on the size of the
  chunks).  When the weather permits, grilling it outdoors on skewers is even
  better.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Broiled beef in a Chinese marinade -- After frequenting a local Chinese
  restaurant, I finally asked for the recipe for the marinade for the meat
  that came on skewers on the pu pu platter. I was given a list of
  ingredients with instructions like "heavy on this, light on this". I
  devised my own amounts from this list. I served it to my family and they
  enjoyed it, so I feel confident sending it to mod.recipes.
  
  *  You may need to double the marinade recipe.  I use a Tupperware
  container made especially for marinating. Any container will do, but it's
  tough having to turn over all those skewers.
  
  *  The hoisin sauce, ginger root and light soy sauce should be available in
  any good grocery store.  Comments, revisions and/or additions will be
  appreciated.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 12 hours marinating, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Makemeat
      Yield: 4 Pounds
 
      5    Feet medium hog casings
  3 1/2 lb Lean pork butt, cubed
    1/2 lb Pork fat, cubed
      2 ts Salt, or to taste
      2 ts Coarse grind black pepper
      1 ts Crushed red pepper
      4 cl Garlic, finely chopped
      3 ts Red wine vinegar
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
      2 tb Brandy
      1 ts Fennel seed
 
  Prepare casings. Grind meat and fat together through the coarse disk and
  mix with remaining ingredients. Place in the fridge for 3-4 hours. This
  gives the wine and brandy a chance to exrtract the flavor from the herbs
  and spices and for the meat to absorb some of the liquid. Stuff into
  casings; use within three days or freeze.

      Title: Chorizos (Mexican Sausage)
 Categories: Pork, Mexican, Meat
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      2 lb Pork tenderloin (ground ok)
      5    Chiles anchos
    1/2 ts Coriander seeds (toasted)
    1/2 ts Peppercorns
    1/8 ts Cumin seeds
      2 tb Sweet paprika
    2/3 c  Mild white vinegar
    1/2 lb Pork fat
      2    Chilies pasilla
      3    Cloves
    1/2 ts Oregano (Mexican Blended)
      4    Garlic cloves (peel/crush)
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      2 fl Vodka (if wanted)
 
  Chop the meat roughly, (or purchase ground pork), together with the fat.
  
  Toast the chilies well, turning them from time to time so they do not burn.
  While they are still warm and flexible, slit them open and remove the seeds
  and veins.  As they cool off they will become crisp.
  
  Grind the spices together withe the chilies.
  
  Mix the ground spices and chilies with the rest of the ingredients and rub
  them well into the meat with your hands.
  
  Cover the mixture and set it aside in the refrigerator to season for 3
  days, stirring it well each day. (Before using, fry a little of the meat
  and taste to see if it has enough salt and seasoning.)
  
  Normally the meat would be put into sausage casings, however, I just use it
  straight from the bowl.  If you don't want to stuff the meat into casings

      Title: Classic Prime Rib
 Categories: Meat, Beef
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Standing roast of beef
           - (4-rib, about 10-11 lbs)
      2 tb Flavorless cooking oil
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. TRIM the excess fat from the roast, leaving only
  1/4-inch of fat. Heat the oil in a large roasting pan over medium-to-high
  heat on top of the stove. When the oil is hot, place the roast, fat-side
  down, in the pan and brown for 5 minutes. Turn the roast on one end and
  cook another 5 minutes. Turn on the other end and cook 5 minutes. Remove
  from heat and discard fat. Sprinkle with desired salt and pepper. Place
  roast in oven and immediately reduce heat to 350F. Roast approximately 12
  minutes per pound for medium-rare, or about 2 hours for a 10-lb roast.
  Remove the pan from the oven, remove the roast from the pan and let stand
  for 25 minutes before carving. To serve, strain the gravy into a sauceboat
  and carve the roast at the table, counting on about 2 people per rib.
  
  FREEZING THE ROAST: Do not carve the entire roast if you don't have to. A
  whole solid piece of meat is more successfully cooked when defrosted than a
  few smaller pieces. Before freezing, heat a dry fry pan over high heat on
  top of the stove. Place the remainder of the roast, cut side down, in the
  pan and sear well. Allow the roast to cool to room temperature. Wrap with
  freezer paper and then over wrap in plastic wrap. Label and place in the
  freezer for up to 1 month. Defrost, without unwrapping, in the refrigerator
  for 24 to 28 hours. To reheat defrosted rib roast, wrap prime rib in 1
  layer of microwave plastic wrap and place in a covered roasting pan or
  Dutch oven. Cover, place in the oven, turn temperature to 250F and cook
  about 8 minutes per pound or until a meat thermometer placed in the
  thickest part of the roast reads 110F. Remove pan from the oven and turn
  temperature to 450F. Unwrap the roast, replace, uncovered in the pan and
  replace in the oven for about 15 minutes to crust the outside.

      Title: Country Ham and Pork Sausage
 Categories: Main dish, Makemeat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Source: Hotlinks and
           -Country Flavors, Aidells
           -and Kelly, 1990
           -Makes: 4 pounds
 
  2 lb.     pork butt 1/2-3/4 lb. leftover boiled or baked country ham or 3/4
  lb. raw country ham 1/2 lb. fat trimmed from ham 1/2 lb. fresh pork back
  fat 2 oz. skin from ham (optional) 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper 1/4
  tsp.    ground cloves 1/2 tsp. ground sage (optional) 1 tsp. red pepper
  flakes 1/2 tsp. ground ginger 1 tsp. sugar 3/4-1 Cup water Medium hog
  casings
  
  Grind the pork butt through a 3/8-inch plate, the ham, ham fat, pork fat,
  and skin through a 1/8-inch plate. If you are starting out with raw country
  ham, simmer a 3/4 lb. piece for about 2 hours, and then cool before
  grinding. The ham stock can be used for pea or bean soup. Taste to make
  sure it's not too salty, though. Mix together thoroughly the ground meats,
  fat, and skin with the spices, sugar, and water. Stuff into medium hog
  casings and tie into 5-inch links. Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze
  for 2 months. Use fried as a patty or poached in links as a less salty but
  very tasty addition to any dish that calls for ham as a seasoning.
  
  Be sure not to add salt to this recipe because country ham is usually quite
  salty and should season the mixture very nicely just by itself. Start with
  1/2 lb.  of ham, then fry and taste a small patty of the sausage. You can
  add more ham if you want a saltier and more intense ham flavor.

      Title: Country Hams: Virginia, Smithfield, Kentucky, Etc.
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 1 Ham
 
      1    Ham
      1 qt Cider
    1/4 c  Brown Sugar
           Black Pepper
           Corn Meal
           Brown Sugar
 
  It is the custom in some parts of the U.S. to hang hams, after special
  processing, for several years, after which time, of course, they develop a
  heavy exterior mold.
  
  To prepare one of these old hams, soak it in cold water to cover for 24 to
  36 hours.  Then scrub it well, using a brush and yellow soap, if necessary,
  to remove the mold.  Rinse thoroughly and place in a kettle of simmering
  water, skin side down.  Allow 20 minutes to the pound until the meat
  reaches an internal heat of 150ø.  Add to the water before last 1/4 of
  cooking time:  cider and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.
  
  Drain when the cooking time has elapsed.  Remove the skin while the ham is
  still warm, being careful not to tear the fat.  Trim the fat partially.
  Dust the ham with a mixture of black pepper, corn meal, and brown sugar.
  
  Put in a 425ø oven long enough to glaze it.  If you want more of a baked
  quality allow the ham to reach an internal heat of 160ø to 165ø. Serve hot
  or cold.  Be sure to slice very, very thin.

      Title: Creole Smoked Sausage and Creole Hot Sausage
 Categories: Meat, Makemeat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Yards small sausage casing
      4 lb Lean pork (or 2 lb lean
           -pork and 2 lb lean beef)
      2 lb Pork fat
      2 ts Finely minced garlic
      2 ts Freshly ground black
           -pepper
      3 tb Salt
      2 ts Cayenne
    1/2 ts Ground bay leaf
    1/4 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Chili powder
      4 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Sugar
      5 ts Colgin's liquid hickory
           -smoke
 
  New Orleans' most popular sausage, a type of country sausage made with
  pork, or pork and beef.  It's not really smoked, but has a fine smokey
  flavor that makes it an ideal seasoning meat for our favorite bean dishes,
  gumbos, and jambalayas.  We also like it pan grilled as a breakfast or
  dinner sausage.  [Also makes great po-boys--ECT] Allow about 20 to 25
  minutes for grilling.  When used as a seasoning meat in other dishes, it
  requires no precooking.
  
  About 6 pounds of 6-8 inch sausage
  
  (To make HOT sausage, omit the liquid hickory smoke and add 1 tsp cayenne
  and 1 tsp black pepper.)  Hot sausage is a good accompaniment to bean
  dishes or smothered vegetables or as a breakfast sausage with grits and
  eggs.  It is not recommended as a seasoning meat in traditional bean dishes
  as it is likely to overwhelm the flavor of the other ingredients.
  
  Prepare the sausage casings and stuffing.  Mix ingredients lightly; the
  stuffing should be slightly coarse in texture.  Cut the casing into 12 inch
  lengths and stuff.  Allow 2 smoked sausages per serving.

      Title: Crispy Prawn and Ham Balls
 Categories: Breads, Main dish, Meat, Seafood
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
----------------------------METRIC MEASUREMENTS----------------------------
    350 g  Raw prawns
    100 g  Water chestnuts; chopped
    100 g  Parma Ham; finely chopped
      2 ts Lemon zest; finely chopped
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground white pepper
      1    Egg white
      1 ts Sesame oil
      2 tb Spring onion; white part **
      2 ts Cornflour
      1 ts Sugar

---------------------------AMERICAN MEASUREMENTS---------------------------
     12 oz Raw shrimps
      4 oz Water chestnuts; chopped
      4 oz Prosciutto; finely chopped
      2 ts Lemon zest; finely chopped
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground white pepper
      1    Egg white
      1 ts Sesame oil
      2 tb Green onions; white part**
      2 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Sugar

---------------------------------FOR FRYING---------------------------------
           Cornflour/starch
           Oil for deep frying
 
  NB ** Onions should be finely chopped.
    Peel the prawns (shrimps) and, if you are using large uncooked ones,
  remove the fine digestive cord. Wash the prawns and pat them dry with
  kitchen paper. Using a cleaver or sharp knife, chop the prawns/shrimps
  coarsely and then mince them finely into a paste. Put the paste into a bowl
  anf mix in the rest of the ingredients for the prawn mixture. Or,
  alternatively, you could do this in a food processor (cuisinart). This step
  can be done hours in advance, but you should then wrap the paste well in
  cling film and put it into the fridge until you need it.
    Using your hands, form the mixture into 4 cms (1 1/2") balls about the
  size of a golf ball. Continue until you have used up all the paste. Dust
  balls in cornflour/starch, shaking off any excess.
    Heat the oil in a deep fat fryer or wok to a moderate heat. Deep fry
  several prawn balls at a time for about 3-4 minutes or until they are
  golden. Repeat the prcess until they are all cooked. Remove with a slotted
  spoon, drain on kitchen paper and serve at once.

  cover beans with 1 inch water.  Add all other ingredients except kielbasa.
  Cover and cook on high for one hour; turn to low and cook overnight. Stir
  once or twice during cooking.  One hour before serving, check the texture
  of the soup.  If it's too thin, mash some of the beans with a potato
  masher.  Add sliced kielbasa.  Cook for one hour. Serve with Tabasco sauce
  and bread or rice.
  
  You can substitute turkey kielbasa, if you prefer, for the regular.
  
  Serves 4 generously.
  
  NOTE:  This soup freezes well.  Leftovers are excellent (usually thicker
  from reheating), and are delicious served over rice.

  These meatballs can be used as snacks for two or three people, or as a
  garnish for roast poultry or game.  Cook the pork in the stock until just
  about tender.  Drain it, reserving the stock,  Use 275 ml/ 10 fl oz/ 1 1/4
  cups of the stock to make almond 'milk' with the ground almonds and rice
  flour or cornflour as described in a previous recipe. Put this and the rest
  of the stock aside, separately, to cool.
  
  Cut the pork into small slices.  It should still be moist but not pink.
  Process the slices in batches in an electric blender, adding the currants,
  spices and seasoning while processing.  Form the mixture into 18 meatballs
  about 4 cm/1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Roll these in a lightly greased
  frying-pan until lightly browned all over, then leave to cool. Thin down
  the almond 'milk' if necessary with a little stock; it should coat the
  meatballs lightly.  Cover each meatball with a little 'sauce'. Just before
  serving, sprinkle the dish lightly with white sugar and the golden mace,
  and decorate with small vivid flowers.

      2 c  All-purpose flour;
      2 ts Baking powder;
    1/2 ts Baking soda;
    1/4 c  Margarine or butter;
    1/2 c  To 3/4 c skim milk;
      6 oz Can tomato paste;

  Suggestion:  for 2 servings, use a small aluminum foil pan about 4 x 8
  inches or press a sheet of aluminum foil into a loaf pan and set the foil
  pan on a cookie sheet.  Measure half the other ingredients and freeze the
  remaining 3 ounces of tomato paste for a future meal.
  
  Preheat the oven to 425 F.  Cook the ground turkey in a large nonstick
  skillet over medium heat until cooked through.  Stir occasionally.
  
  Combine flour, baking powder, and margarine in a bowl.  Cut the margarine
  into the flour with a fork until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add
  enough milk to make a soft, elastic dough (like biscuit dough). Press the
  dough into the sides and bottom of an 8-inch square baking pan.
  
  Combine the tomato paste and seasonings and spread over the dough. Crumble
  the ground turkey over the sauce.  Sprinkle on the green pepper, mushrooms
  and cheese.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the crust is brown and
  crisp.  Cut into four squares to serve.

      Title: Dhana Ghosht
 Categories: Meat, Indian
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Stewing lamb, trimmed
           -of fat and diced
      2 c  Yogurt (full-fat),
           -natural
      6    Garlic cloves, crushed
      4 ts Coriander, ground
      2    Lila murcha, (fresh
           -green chili peppers),
           -crushed
      4 ts Paprika
      4 ts Salt (or less)
      3 ts Ginger, coarsely crushed
      4 tb Cooking oil
           -(mustard oil is best)
      2 md Onions (or more
           -to taste)
      3 ts Cumin seeds
      1 ts Turmeric powder
      2 ts Black mustard seed
      2 ts Red chili powder
           -(also called cayenne
           -pepper or lal mirch)
      4 oz Coriander, fresh
 
  Dice the meat into bite-size cubes and soak in warm water for 2-3 minutes.
  
  Mix the paprika, ground coriander, salt, crushed garlic and crushed green
  chilies with yogurt.  Drain the lamb and add to the yogurt marinade. Leave
  to marinate for at least six hours. Ideally it should marinate in the
  refrigerator for 24 hours.
  
  Dice the onions into thin semi-circles.  In a large saucepan or a generous
  frying-pan,  heat the cooking oil over a high flame.  Add the onions when
  the oil is hot enough to "steam." Reduce the heat to medium and stir
  occasionally.  Fry the onions until they change colour to a deep red/brown.
  This should take 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  At this point add the black mustard seeds and stir a few times.  Then add
  the ginger, cumin seeds, red chilies and turmeric powder. Increase the heat
  and fry this "masala" for a couple of minutes. Add the marinated lamb to
  the masala and mix well.
  
  At this point you have two options, either to cook the meat on the stove or
  to bake it. Stove-top cooking takes less time but requires fairly constant
  stirring.  It should be cooked in a covered saucepan on a low to medium
  flame for about 45 minutes. Add water if the sauce gets too dry and begins
  to stick. For baking, transfer it to an ovenproof casserole, cover it, and
  bake for 1 1/2 hours at 200 degrees F. Check occasionally, though you are
  unlikely to need to add any water to the sauce.
  
  Finally, prepare and wash the fresh coriander in cold water.  Only the
  leaves and the tender stems should be retained. Chop coarsely and mix well
  just before serving. If you don't have any fresh coriander, then mix in
  about 2-3 t of coriander powder. Serve with well buttered (boiled) rice or
  pita bread and fresh salad.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A popular North Indian lamb dish with coriander -- This is a family
  variation on a popular North Indian dish.  I cook it whenever I could get
  hold of fresh coriander, which in Edinburgh is seldom.
  
  I don't know its authentic Indian name.  We simply call it "dhana lamb" as
  that's how its always cooked at home.  Dhana means "coriander" in Gujarati.
  Yield:  Serves 3-4.
  
  *  Take care not to burn the onions and don't overcook the masala just
  before mixing in the marinated meat.
  
  *  I think the dish tastes a lot better if it is baked.  It's even better
  if cooked for a longer period at a lower temperature.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 day marinating, 2 1/2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Steak, Chiles, Grilled
      Yield: 8 servings.
 
    1/2 c  Ground pure New Mexico hot
           Red chile
      2 c  Canned whole tomatoes or 4
           Large red-ripe tomatoes,
           Peeled, quartered
      1 c  Parched, peeled, seeded,
           Chopped fresh New Mexico hot
           Green chiles or 1 (7 oz.)
           Can diced green chiles
      1    Hot red onion, cut in cubes
      4 lg Cloves garlic
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground oregano, pref.Mexican
    1/4 ts Ground cumin
      4 lb Well-aged beef sirloin, cut
           1-1/2 to 2 inches thick
 
  One of the heirs to a New Mexico mercantile fortune developed this
  Albuquerque special.  These fiery-hot steaks sort of go with the territory
  in New Mexico, they say you can tell the natives by how hot they can
  handle their chiles!  Though it's virtually steaming, the steak sauce is a
  super complement for the strong flavor of the beef.
  
  In a blender or food processor, combine ground chile, tomatoes, chiles,
  onion, garlic, salt, oregano and cumin.  Process until pureed.  If made
  ahead, refrigerate until ready to use.  To prepare steak, let both steak
  and sauce come to room temperature. Then place steak in a shallow dish,
  coat generously on both sides with sauce and let stand 2 hours at room
  temperature, spooning more sauce over steak occasionally.  Preheat broiler
  or prepare a bed of hot coals.  Adjust oven rack so meat will be 4 to 6
  inches below heat source; adjust barbecue grill 4 to 6 inches above coals.
  Lightly grease rack in broiler pan or barbecue grill. Broil or grill steak
  (with sauce that clings to it) to desired doneness, turning once; allow 10
  to 15 minutes per side for medium rare.  Serve with additional sauce,
  warmed over low heat.

 Categories: Meat, Sauces, Marinades
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  1/2 Dijon mustard                  1/4 cup plus 1 "shot" Jim Beam 1/4 cup
  soy sauce                  1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar 3 tbs
  Worcestershire sauce         1/3 cup minced scallion 3 cloves garlic,
  minced Directions: Sample whiskey to test for quality. All ingredients
  should be of the finest quality. This is also known as "searing" and keeps
  all the juices in. Stir all ingredients together in a bowl. I use this
  Southern marinade for shellfish like shrimp or scallops, covered at room
  temperature for an hour.  For beef, poultry or pork, cover and chill
  overnight.  Baste the seafood or meat with the marinade as it is grilled.
  Makes about 1-1/2 cups & I usually double the recipe to have plenty of
  sauce for basting.

      Title: Eastern N. Carolina Minced Pork Barbecue
 Categories: Bbq, Pork, Meat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      9 lb Pork, preferably trimmed
           Half shoulders, in about 3
           Chunks

-----------------------------------BRINE-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------

---------------------------------DIRECTIONS---------------------------------
 
  1 c  Good wine or cider vinegar 1 c Water 1 t Freshly ground black pepper
  1/4 t  Ground red pepper 1 ea Bay leaf, crumbled 1 t Rosemary twigs 3 T Raw
  turbinado sugar, brown -sugar, honey or molasses 2 T Salt 1/2 c Catsup 1/2
  c Canned crushed tomatoes 1/2 c Good wine or cider vinegar 2 T Raw
  turbinado sugar, brown -sugar, honey or molasses 1 ea Or 2 fresh chilies,
  seeds -and membranes optionally ~removed, -OR- Dried whole or crushed red
  ~chilies 1 ea Clove garlic, crushed 1 T Soy sauce 1 t Dried thyme, oregano,
  or -sage 1/2 c Sliced onions Stir the Brine ingredients to dissolve. Rinse
  and wash the pork in running water. Immerse the pork chunks in brine poured
  into heavy plastic bags. Force the air from the bags and seal. Marinate the
  pork for 12 to 18 hours in the refrigerator, turning twice. The meat should
  "cure" to a light gray and become firm. Smoking: Prepare electric smoke
  oven with at least a quart of water and a good handful of wook chips or
  twigs. Use hardwoods or fruitwoods in the chip tray. Soak them to prolong
  the smoke. Spray racks with vegetable cooking spray. Place pork on racks
  without piercing with a fork.  Smoke the meat at a bare sizzling
  temperature (175 degrees F) for 4 to  4 1/2 hours. Replenish the water pan
  or chip tray if necessary. Remove pork and disconnect smoker. Allow the
  meat to cool for half an hour. Trim the meat of skin and fat, and remove
  the meat from bones. Using a large knife or cleaver, slice, dice and mince
  the meat.  The meat should still be slightly pink, even when fully cooked.
  This is a characteristic of smoke ovens. (The cooking is not completed yet,
  however.) Simmer the sauce ingredients gently for 1 hour or until slightly
  thickened. Allow it to cook, stirring occasionally. Blend the minced pork
  with the sauce, reserving 1/2 cup of sauce for the table. Pack into
  casserole dishes, cover, and heat in a 200F oven for 1 hour. Uncover, stir,
  and serve. EnjoyIngredients:

      Title: Enchiladas Sabrosas
 Categories: Meat, Latin
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Ground meat (mixed
           -ground beef and
           -ground pork)
      1 md Onion
    1/2    Green pepper
      5    Garlic cloves
      1    Cilantro bunch
    1/2 ts Red pepper
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cumin (or more)
    1/2 c  Wine or sherry
    3/4 c  Black olives
  1 1/2 c  Enchilada sauce
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
           -(1 small can)
     12    Corn tortillas
    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese
    1/2 c  Sour cream (optional)
           Oil
 
  Chop onion and garlic; place them in a frying pan with the ground meats.
  Saute them without adding fat.  When meat is brown, add the chopped green
  pepper and most of the cilantro leaves and cook for another minute or two
  (until green pepper is cooked bright green). Drain well, then add (about)
  several tablespoons of the enchilada sauce and cook for a few minutes
  longer. Set aside.
  
  Make the sauce:  into a saucepan, pour the remaining enchilada sauce (from
  the can). Add the can of tomato sauce. Add the wine or sherry, cumin, salt,
  red pepper, and cook for 10-30 minutes (depending on how compulsive you
  are). The flavor should be smooth (not gritty) and spicy.
  
  Collect together everything that you will need for assembling the
  enchiladas. Grate the cheese onto wax paper. Have the olives handy (you'll
  be cutting them in half). Lightly oil the baking dish.
  
  The frying pan from which you drained the meat mixture still has some of
  its grease left in it. Take 4 tortillas from their package, separate them
  from each other, then one-by-one, slide them over the frying pan surface on
  each side, to moisten them slightly with the grease. That done, stack them
  in the frying pan and heat them until they are soft and pliable.
  
  The final  assembly requires a bit of manual dexterity and speed: Take the
  tortillas, and place them (bumpy side out) in the oven dish, curved into a
  "U" shape, each right next to its neighbor.  (At this point, start heating
  your  next 4 tortillas in the frying pan. I usually wind up preparing 10
  tortillas in all.)
  
  Place a small handful of cheese into the U of each tortilla, followed by an
  appropriate amount of meat mixture, and finally several olive halves. Then
  curl one end of the tortilla around to tuck into the opposite end, and
  carefully rotate it to conceal the seam.  Each tortilla should be filled
  firmly (not too loosely) but not overflowing the ends.
  
  Once all the filling is used up and the enchiladas are now filled
  tortillas, pour the sauce over the top, helping it run into all the
  crevices. Sprinkle lightly with remaining cilantro leaves. 10 Cover with
  aluminum foil and bake for 20-30 minutes, just until the tortillas are soft
  and the sauce is slightly bubbly. Let sit for 5 minutes, then serve, topped
  with a dollop of sour cream. If you fail to drain the meat well enough, the
  enchiladas will be greasy. If over-baked, it tastes all right, but the
  tortillas lose their texture. In general, however, the recipe is quite
  forgiving in its proportions. Feel free to adjust the seasoning to your own
  tolerance for hot spice. I like to assemble this recipe at least 3 hours
  before baking to give the flavors a chance to blend. Left refrigerated for
  a day, the seasoning is even less aggressive. Served with a salad (and some
  Mexican beer), it's a complete meal.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Enchiladas with meat, black olives and cheese -- For many years, I've
  been involved in Latin American "solidarity work" here in the San Francisco
  area, and as a result, I have learned some of its culinary pleasures. This
  recipe originated from the back of a can of enchilada sauce in Mexico, but
  was refined by a special Chilean refugee friend who won a scholarship to
  the California Culinary Academy (in San Francisco) and now cooks
  ever-so-lusciously.  Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 30 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK, but time the baking carefully.

      Title: Fajitas
 Categories: Meat, Tex-mex
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Skirt steak
      2 lg Yellow onions
      2 tb Vegetable oil
     16    Whole-wheat tortillas
      2 c  Cheese, grated
      3 c  Guacamole

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 c  Lime juice
      1 tb Black pepper, ground
      2 tb Garlic, minced

-------------------------------PICO DE GALLO-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Fresh cilantro, chopped
      2    Scallions, chopped
           -(green onions)
      2 lg Tomatoes, chopped
      1 ts Garlic, minced
 
  Combine marinade ingredients in a large glass baking dish.  Peel the fatty
  membrane from both sides of the skirt steak.  This requires a very sharp
  knife.  Add meat to marinade and marinate for at least 4 hours, preferably
  overnight.  Keep it in the refrigerator if you marinate overnight.
  
  MAKE THE PICO DE GALLO:  Combine all of the ingredients in a small serving
  bowl.
  
  Slice the yellow onions into 1/4-inch slices and cut each slice into a
  semi- circle. Grill the meat until it is cooked slightly less than the way
  you like it. Meanwhile, saute the onions in the oil until they are soft.
  Use a large frying pan that will have enough room for the meat later.
  
  After removing the meat from the grill, slice it into strips that are cut
  across the grain.  The strips should be about 3-4 inches long and about 1/4
  inch thick.  Add the strips to the onions in the pan and fry for another
  minute or two.
  
  Place on the table the pan full of meat, the bowl of pico de gallo, a
  basket with the tortillas, a bowl with the guacamole, and a bowl with the
  grated cheese. You may wish to provide picante sauce in addition.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Barbecued skirt steak marinated in lime:  a Tex-Mex favorite -- Fajitas
  originated in Texas as a way to make cheap meat palatable. Unfortunately,
  it was too successful. It is still palatable, but because the word is out
  that fajitas are so delicious, the meat isn't cheap any more. Because this
  is not a traditional Mexican dish but a recent invention of Mexican
  immigrants, there is no fixed formula for it. Many different kinds of
  marinade are used; this one is adapted from a recipe given to a friend over
  the phone by Tortuga's in Austin, Texas.
  
  *  Each person makes her own fajita by taking a tortilla, spooning some of
  the meat onto it, then adding her choice of each of the other ingredients
  in whatever combination she wants.
  
  *  Skirt steak is somewhat like flank steak:  somewhat tough and with a
  very stringy texture. It is covered on both sides with a fatty membrane
  that must be removed or the meat will be very tough. The key to good
  fajitas is the proper removal of this membrane. Fresh-squeezed lime juice
  is best, but bottled will do. Some people from out of state choose to put
  sour cream on their fajitas.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes preparation, several hours marinating, 10 minutes
  cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: Filling Sausage
 Categories: Makemeat, Meat
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Sausage meat should be finely ground, as it keeps and holds together
  better.  Beef alone, or pork alone can be used, but better two-thirds fat
  and lean pork, and one-third beef.  Vary the seasoning by using pepper,
  onions, sage, nutmeg or cloves--the latter two are not very common. For
  filling the skins a piece of bone 2 or 3 inches long is most serviceable,
  but a piece of tin, shaped into a funnel, smallest end a trifle smaller
  than skins, will do very nicely.  Insert this funnel into one end, hold in
  left hand, and proceed to fill, using the thumb to force the meat down.
  Prick the casings often with a hatpin, to let out any air. To have a change
  make some with cooked barley and with potato (raw), finely choppped or
  ground.  Use the proportion of 1/4 of barley or potatoes. This is fine.

  Hi, thought maybe someone out there would like either of my recipes.
  
                        Roast Beef Bar - B - Q  Pizza :
  
    I always use Robin Hood pizza dough mix or you can use your regular dough
  recipe for the crust.
    You'll need 1# of Roast Beef, cut it into small pieces then pour 1 bottle
  of B-B-Q sauce into the meat. After you have the meat well coated then
  spread the mixture onto your pizza crust. You can use whatever cheese you
  like the most, I always use Mozzarella on mine.
  
                        Pierogie Pizza:
    1. Your favorite pizza crust
    2. A mixture of mashed potatoes (I've always used homemade, never tried
  powder yet)
    3. Small can of sauerkraut
    4. Mozzarella and cheddar cheese (I sometimes use 3 cups of cheese
  depending on how much of the potato mix you put on your pizza.)
  
    Use your mixer to mix the sauerkraut into the mashed potatoes.  Then
  spread onto your crust and then add cheese.  You can put as much potatoe
  mix as you want on the pizza just becareful when you cut it the potato mix
  will be very hot!
  
    I hope you enjoy them!!!

     10 oz Pork; in 1" chunks
           (or use chicken)
           Oil to deep fry
     20 oz Can pineapple chunks
           -drain, reserve juice
      1 c  Thinly sliced celery
      1 c  Thinly sliced carrot
      1 c  Chopped onion
      1 tb Oil to stir fry veggies
           Hot cooked rice to serve

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Salt
      4 dr Sesame oil

-----------------------------------BATTER-----------------------------------
      1 md Egg; beaten
      1 ds Salt
      1 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Water

------------------------------SWEET SOUR SAUCE------------------------------
      3 tb Vinegar *
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      2 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Hoisin sauce
      8 oz Can tomato sauce
      1 tb Dry white wine
           *(or use 4 tbsp vinegar)
    3/4 c  Reserved pineapple juice
           -add water if necessary
           -to make 3/4 cup
      1 ea Garlic clove; minced
 
  MARINADE: Combine marinade ingredients, add pork and set aside at least 30
  minutes to marinate. (I let it marinate all day)
  
  SAUCE: Combine sauce ingredients adding cornstarch last. Set aside.
  
  VEGETABLES: Stir fry vegetables in 1 tbsp oil in wok until tender-crisp.
  Set aside with pineapple chunks.
  
  BATTER: Beat batter ingredients to a thick paste. Combine with pork AND
  marinade until pork is thoroughly covered in batter.
  
  TO PREPARE: Heat enough oil in wok to deep fry battered pork. Pick pork
  from batter with a skewer making sure each piece is thoroughly coated with
  batter, and drop into hot oil. Fry until golden brown. You may have to fry
  them in 3 batches in order to make sure they do not stick together. As each
  batch is done, remove from oil and place on rack on edge of wok to drain.
  Repeat for each batch.
  
  Discard any unused batter, or drop by spoonfuls into hot oil and fry crisp.
  The addition of the marinade ingredients gives the batter a delicate
  flavor, delicious as a snack or added with the pork to the finished dish.
  
  Remove oil from wok and wipe clean.
  
  Stir previously combined sauce ingredients until thoroughly blended. Pour
  into hot wok, stirring constantly until thickened. Add pork and vegetables
  making sure all are coated with sauce. When all are heated through, serve
  with hot cooked white rice.

---------------------------------BASIC RIBS---------------------------------
      3 lb Country Ribs or other
      2 tb Black Pepper fine ground
      1 c  Cider Vinegar
      2 tb Garlic Salt

----------------------------SAUCE FOR RE-HEATING----------------------------
      1 ea Open Pit small bottle
    1/4 c  Molasses
      1 ea Small Bottle A-1 Sauce
      1 ea Supply of Hickory Chips
 
  Regular old supermarket pork. Spare ribs, country ribs, or any other pork
  Not too much fat. Cut off any gross excess, and cut them to EVEN thickness.
  You'll ruin everything if you cook the meat unevenly. You may compensate by
  scoring the meat. In a large baking pan, soak the ribs with cider vinegar,
  after which sprinkle them with garlic salt and finely ground black pepper.
  (Don't use pepper mills, or other peppers.) It doesn't seem to matter how
  long the ribs soak, or how much vinegar is on them. Just make sure it hits
  all sides, you don't have to puncture them. This sweetens the meat. The key
  to the fire is the hickory chips. Keep feeding these amazing little fellows
  to the charcoal. The flavor comes out of these chips and you cannot do
  without them. Make sure the fat and chips don't light up your whole dinner
  and ruin it. Cooking: A moderate hot fire a couple of inches or more from
  the meat, and a grill of reasonable cleanness. As the meat cooks turn it
  often, do not let it burn, do not baste it with anything. Don't cover the
  grill and don't stray too far -- fire is always hiding in the wings. Here
  is the catch -- the trick -- the hard part, is the timing. You may ruin
  some meals before you hit it, but the time to take them off the grill is
  one minute after trichina danger is past. As soon as the meat turns brown
  it's time to eat. You can use the small strips you cut off to judge just
  when things are perfect. Special Purpose Sauce: (don't eat it cold, it's
  awful) 1 bottle Open Pit, One bottle A-1 Sauce, 1/4 C of molasses. Start
  re-heating the sauce until slow boil, dump in the cold pork from the
  fridge. alt. without sauce wrap the meat in foil and heat at 325 oven for
  15-20 minutes. Sauce can be stored and re-used, but remember it will have
  pork fat in it now.

      Title: Fried Ham with Red-Eyed Gravy
 Categories: Meat, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Ham slices, like all other pork, should be fried well done, but never hard
  and dry.  It is always well to serve tart appple sauce or fried apples with
  ham or pork of any kind.  The tart in the apple kills the effect of the
  grease.
  
  Red-eyed gravy is made with the pparticles that stick to the skiillet after
  ham is fried.  Pour off the fat into a small bowl, add about 6 T. of water
  to the skillet and let this come to a boil.  The red or dark substance will
  boil loose from the skiillet.  Pour this into the fat and let set a few
  minutes.  Dip to the bottom and put it over hot biscuits or any other kind
  of bread, and you have something goood. We kids of the hills call thes
  "red-eyed gravy" because of the red particles that rise with the fat.

 Categories: Ethnic, Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Olive oil
      2    Garlic cloves finely choppd
      2 tb Parsley finely chopped
      4    Sirloin steaks **
           Black pepper
      4 lg Mushrooms
      2 lg Tomatoes halved
           **Sirloin steak is the large
           Bit on a T Bone. The small
           Bit is the fillet.
 
  Mix the oil, garlic, and parsley in a bowl. Spread some of the mix onto one
  side of the steak.  Sprinkle black pepper on top. Preheat the grill. Pop
  the steaks under and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, dependent on how you like
  them. Turn the steaks and brush on remaining oil/herb mix. Brush tomatoes
  with a little oil and place them alongside the steaks. Cook for a further 5
  to 8 minutes. Note: Do not sprinkle salt onto the steaks as this draws
  moisture from the meat. Entrecote is a sirloin with all the fat removed.

      Title: Garlic-Stuffed Leg of Lamb with Cabernet Sauce
 Categories: Lamb
      Yield: 10 -12
 
      1    Leg of lamb, about 5 to 6
           Lb., boned
 
  2-3     c  Cabernet Sauvignon
  6-8     lg heads fresh garlic, broken
  :          into cloves, unpeeled
  1-1/2   T  finely minced fresh rosemary
  1-1/2   ts anchovy paste
  3       bn fresh spinach (about 5-6
  :          cups tightly packed)
  1-2     ts arrowroot
  1       T  whole fresh rosemary leaves,
  :          stripped from stem
  
  Remove excess fat and skin from outside of lamb.  Lay meat flat with
  boned-out side up.  Make deep gashes in thick areas of the meat so that it
  is of consistent height and thickness.  These gashes will also provide
  pockets for the stuffing, and meat will cook evenly.  Place meat in a deep
  bowl and pour enough wine over to almost cover.  Marinate for 1-2 hours.
  Place garlic in saucepan and cover with water.  Simmer 10 mins until
  cloves are soft.  Do not overcook!  Drain and rinse with cold water. Cut
  off stem end, pinch at bottom and pop cloves out.  Mash garlic into a
  thick paste or process in blender.  Add minced rosemary and anchovy paste
  and blend well.  Remove meat from marinade, reserving marinade liquid.
  Lay meat flat with uncut side down and spread paste evenly over inside and
  down into pockets.
  
  Wash spinach; remove stems and coarse ribs.  Place in a nonstick pan and,
  using only the water left clinging to the leaves after washing, cook over
  high heat, covered, for 1 minute.  Turn as necessary to evenly wilt
  spinach.  Remove excess water by squeezing.  Distribute spinach evenly
  over pate-covered meat surface.  Roll lamb into roast form and truss with
  twine in 1 inch pattern.
  
  Spread excess garlic mixture that may ooze out during trussing over
  exterior of finished rolled meat.  Roast in preheated 500 degree oven for
  10 minutes to sear outside of lamb.  Reduce heat to 325 degrees for 10
  minutes per lb.  Allow lamb to "set up" for 15 minutes before carving.
  
  Meanwhile, place marinade in saucepan and heat over medium heat until
  sauce is reduced by half.  Skim if necessary.  Thicken with arrowroot
  which has been dissolved in cold water.  Add whole fresh rosemary leaves,
  reheat and serve with sliced lamb.

 Categories: Makemeat
      Yield: 10 Pounds
 
      5 lb Beef chuck, round or shank
      3 lb Lean pork butt, cubed
      2 lb Pork fat, cubed
      5 tb Salt
      1 c  Brandy, good quality
  1 1/2 tb Sugar

      1 ts Coriander seed-finely ground
      2 ts Garlic, finely minced
      1 ts Cardamom
    1/2 ts Ascorbic acid
      1 ts Saltpeter
      4    Feet large beef casings
 
  Grind the beef, pork, and fat separatelt through the coarse disk. Mix
  together and chill in freezer a half hour or so. Grind through the fine
  disk. Mix remaining ingredients in. Cure in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
  Pack into casings, tying off into 12" links, and hang to dry. Since the
  salami is a very thick sausage, eight weeks is the minimum time you should
  allow before sampling. Depending upon your specific drying conditions,
  twelve weeks is about the optimim drying time.

      Title: Genuine Texas Red Chili (Rio Llano Variety)
 Categories: Main dish, Meat, Soup
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Lean beef or venison, coarse
      6 oz Pearl or Lone Star beer
      3 oz Tomato paste
      2 tb Freshly ground cumin seeds
      3 ts Freshly gr. oregano leaves
      3    Med. cloves garlic, crushed
      1    Med. onion, finely chopped
      3 ts Salt
      6    Long red chili pods
 
  In a large stew pot, put meat, beer, and 2 cups water.  Simmer meat until
  light grey in color, and add tomato paste.  Stir and simmer for a few
  minutes, then add spices (which have been ground in perfectly dry blender
  at high speed), garlic, onion and salt.  Stir thoroughly and remove from
  heat.
  
  Remove stems and seeds from chili pods and boil in covered saucepan with 3
  cups water for 15 minutes.  Remove peppers and water to blender and blend
  into thick sauce.  Add sauce to meat and simmer 2 hours. Serves 4 to 6.
  
  If chili needs thickening, up to 4 ts of Masa Harina (corn flour) may be
  added.  This adds a unique Mexican flavor.  If chili is too thick,
  additional water may be added, but add slowly and cautiously.
  
  For low calorie or greaseless chile, use very lean meat and never add suet.
  
  If additional "caliente" is needed, while chili is simmering, add ground
  cayenne pepper or Tabasco sauce.
  
  A word about chili peppers -- chili peppers, the real secret to good chili,
  can be found in many varieties, all rich in vitamins A and C. Long Red
  Anaheims are mildly hot, and the many Mexican varieties or Anchos, are
  usually deeper in color and more pungent.  Chili Pisado is a very mild
  pepper usually found in dried form which provides almost no heat, but is
  rich in flavor and color.  They may be used in combination with the small
  red very pungent Jap Chilies.  A combination of mild and hot peppers mey be
  necessary to get the desired red color and hotness.
  
  Fresh or dried pods may be used, as well as ground chili peppers or chili
  powder (not to be confused with commercial chili powders, many of which are
  blends containing additional spices; check ingredients on label). Use chili
  powder only when nothing else is available since the powdering process
  seems to leave a slight bitter taste.

      Title: Glazed Venison Pate
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb Venison (trimmed weight)
    1/2 lb Belly of pork (trimmed wt.)
    1/2 lb Chicken livers
      1 sm Orange
      1    Lemon
      2    Garlic cloves
  1 1/2 ts Fresh thyme (more to taste)
           Whole and ground bay leaves
      1 tb Red wine vinegar
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/4 pt Red wine
      1 ts Gelatine powder
           A few kumquats to decorate
 
  Mince all three meats fairly finely and put them into a bowl.  Add the zest
  of the orange and lemon, the crushed garlic, the thyme, olive oil, vinegar,
  a generous pinch of powdered bay and plenty of black pepper. Mix thoroughly
  and stir in the wine.  Cover and leave to marinate overnight.
  
  Season with salt - I find 1 teaspoon about right but fry a small nugget of
  the mixture to check.  Turn the pate into a terrine of about 2 1/4 pint
  capacity.  Pack the mixture well down into the corners of the dish and use
  a spoon to hollow out slightly the centre top. Cover with greaseproof paper
  and foil, stand the dish in a roasting pan containing enough hot water to
  come halfway up the sides of the dish. Bake at 325 F (160 C) gas mark 3 for
  2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours.
  
  Using a bulb baster, remove and reserve most of the juices that surround
  the pate.  Replace the greaseproof paper and foil, press the pate lightly
  with 1-1/2 to 2 lb weights and cool for 1-1/2 hours. Then drain off any
  remaining juices that have not been re-absorbed by the pate. Mix all the
  venison juices that you have collected with the juice of the orange and
  measure.  Add a splash of water if necessary to make 1/2 pint in total.
  Dissolve the gelatine powder in the mixture and use it to glaze the pate,
  adding a few bay leaves and kumquats to decorate if liked.

      Title: Greek Style Moussaka
 Categories: Meat, European, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 md Eggplants
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      3 lg Onions; chopped fine
      2 lb Ground lamb; (or beef)
      3 tb Tomato paste
    1/2 c  Red wine
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
    1/4 lb Butter
      6 tb Flour
      1 qt Milk
      4    Eggs; beaten until frothy
           Grated nutmeg
      2 c  Ricotta or cottage cheese
      1 c  Fine bread crumbs
      1 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Peel the eggplants and cut them into slices about 1/2 inch thick. Brown the
  slices quickly in 1/4 cup of the oil. Set aside. Heat the remaining oil in
  the same skillet and cook the onions until they are brown. Add the ground
  meat and cook 10 minutes. Pour off excess fat. Combine the tomato paste
  with the wine, parsley, cinnamon, salt and peper. Stir this mixture into
  the meat and simmer over low heat, stirring frequently, until all the
  liquid has been absorbed. Remove the mixture from the fire. Preheat the
  oven to 375F. Make a white sauce by melting the butter and blending in the
  flour, stirring with a wire whisk. Meanwhile, bring the milk to a boil and
  add it gradually to the butter-flour mixture, stirring constantly. When the
  mixture is thickened and smooth, remove it from the heat. Cook slightly and
  stir in the beaten eggs, nutmeg and ricotta. Grease an 11x16-inch pan and
  sprinkle the bottom lightly with crumbs. Arrange alternate layers of the
  eggplant and the meat sauce in the pan, sprinkling each layer with Parmesan
  and crumbs. Pour the ricotta sauce over the top and bake 1 hour, or until
  top is golden. Remove from the oven and cool 20 to 30 minutes before
  serving. Cut into squares and serve. The flavors in this dish really
  improve if you make it a day ahead.

  450 g/1 lb shortcrust pastry 1 egg white, beaten until liquid 450 g/1 lb
  boned breasts of chicken, pigeon or wild duck and/or saddle of hare or
  rabbit (not stewing meat) Salt and black pepper 450 g/1 lb minced beef 2
  tablespoons shredded suet 3 hard-boiled egg yolks, crumbled Spice mixture
  made with 1/4 teaspoon each ground cinnamon and mace and a pinch of ground
  cloves 25 g/1 oz stoned cooking dates, chopped 25 g/1 oz currants 50 g/2 oz
  stoned prunes, soaked and drained 125 ml/4 fl oz/ 1/2 cup beef stock 1
  tablespoon rice flour or cornflour
  
  No Christmas feast in medieval times was complete without a 'grete pye'. In
  some recipes, it could contain many varied meats, but quite often only two
  or three different kinds were suggested; change the meats suggested here if
  you wish.
  
  Use just over half the pastry to line a 23-cm/9-inch pie plate. Brush the
  inside with some of the egg white.
  
  Skin the pieces of breast and other meat if necessary and parboil them
  gently in salted water for 10-15 minutes.  Drain and leave to cool. Mix
  together in a bowl the minced beef, suet, salt and pepper to taste, the egg
  yolks and half the spice mixture.  Add the rest of the spices to the dried
  fruit in another bowl.  Slice the parboiled meat. Pre-heat the oven to
  220C/425F/Gas Mark 7.
  
  Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of the beef stock to the rice flour or cornflour in
  a small saucepan and cream them together; then add the remaining stock and
  stir over gentle heat until slightly thickened. Keep aside.
  
  Cover the bottom of the pastry case with half the mince mixture. Arrange
  the sliced meat in a flat layer on top.  Scatter the chopped spiced fruit
  over it and cover with the remaining mince.  Pour the thickened stock over
  the lot.
  
  Roll out the remaining pastry into a round to make a lid for the pie. Brush
  the rim of the case with a little more egg white and cover with the lid.
  Press the edges to seal, and make escape slits for steam. Decorate with the
  pastry trimmings and glaze with egg white.  Bake for 15 minutes, then
  reduce the heat to 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 and bake for 45-50 minutes longer.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

      1 c  Olive oil
      2    Lemons, juiced
    1/3 c  Tomato paste
      2 ts Rosemary
    1/2 ts Black pepper,
           -ground coarse
    1/2 ts Marjoram

    1/2 ts Savory
 
  Have the butcher butterfly the leg of lamb, or do it yourself.
  
  Combine all remaining ingredients in a glass, enamel, stainless, or plastic
  container and beat with a whisk or fork until combined.  It takes a few

  minutes on each side, brushing occasionally with the marinade. Serve sliced
  thin (hot) with the rest of the marinade, heated.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Leg of Lamb with Rosemary & Tomato Baste -- My wife and I have used this
  recipe a number of times, and have found that the marinade, in and of
  itself, is excellent for any type of lamb. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  This also makes wonderful sandwiches if there are any leftovers.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  several hours marinating, 30 minutes cooking.

    1/2 c  Breadcrumbs, seasoned
      1    Egg
      4 oz Cooked Ham slices, chopped
      4 oz Shredded cheese
           Mozzarella or Swiss
           Water or white wine
      1 cl Garlic, finely minced
      1 pk Egg Roll Wrappers
           Pepper
 
  Mix ground chicken, seasoned crumbs and egg with hands. Add water if too
  dense. Pat out about 1/4 inch thick on a cookie sheet that has been covered
  with saran. Cover and let set up in refigerator for about an hour.
  
  Chop the cooked ham (boiled ham, whatever) in very small dice. Mix with
  finely grated cheese of choice. Add garlic and pepper to taste. Mix with
  enough white wine or water to make it hold together a little. Spread on
  chicken mix. Using edge of saran, pull the sheet up a little and roll the
  edge over on itself. Cut with sharp knife along edge opposite fold. Repeat
  folding and cutting until you use up sheet of mix. Cut little "log" into
  several parts equaling 2 1/2 to 3 inches. Lay log diagonally on egg roll
  wrapper.Dampen edges of wrapper with water. Turn up opposite points on ends
  of log. Turn one loose side over and tuck, then roll it to complete the
  roll.
  
  Place rolls on a baking sheet, cover and put in the refrigerator for about
  an hour to "set" the wrapper. Drop in moderately hot fat and cook until
  browned, or, place on cookie sheet and bake for 45 minutes or until meat is
  cooked.
  
  NOTE: Make sure, if you fry them, to have the grease lower than usually so
  the chicken gets cooked thoroughly.

      Title: Hamburger Petal Pie
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      1 c  Onion, chopped
      1 c  Green pepper, chopped
    1/2    Garlic clove, crushed
      2 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 lb Hamburger
    1/3 c  Water
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Flour
      1    Egg, slightly beaten
      1 lb Biscuits, canned
 
  Saute the onion, green pepper and garlic in the oil until tender then add
  the beef and cook until brown all over. Dump out the grease and add about
  1/3 cup of water. Add the worchestershire sauce, salt, pepper and flour.
  Simmer until the juice thickens.
  
  Separate the biscuits and brush the edges with the egg.  Put the biscuits
  against the sides and bottom of a pie plate so it is completely covered.
  
  Stir the rest of the egg into the meat mixture and then spoon the meat into
  the pie shell.  If you wish you can garnish with a few tomato wedges. Bake
  in a pre-heated oven at 450 degrees F. for about 8 to 10 minutes. The
  biscuits should be slightly browned.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick hamburger dish -- I got this recipe from Judy Halter who got it
  from her sister.  Yield:  serves 5.
  
  *  This gets its name because the biscuits around the edge puff up to look
  like the petals around the center of a sunflower.  This is a great bachelor
  meal because you can come in from work and make it without much effort,
  time or dish washing. You can play with different spices to change the
  flavor. Some of my friends like to put cheese on top before baking it.
  
  *  If you live outside North America, remember that a biscuit is a scone.

      Title: Headcheese
 Categories: Makemeat, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
  4 1/2 lb Fresh pigs feet
      2 lb Fresh pigs heart
      1 lb Fresh pigs tongue
      4 qt Water
    1/4 c  + 2 ts. salt
      1 tb Cider vinegar
    1/4 c  Strained fresh lemon juice
      2 tb Butter
      1 c  Finely chopped onions
      1 md Bay leaf, finely crumbled
      1 ts Ground sage
    1/4 ts Ground mace
    1/2 ts Cayenne
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 c  Finely chopped fresh parsley
      1 c  Finely chopped scallions,
           Including 3" of green tops
 
  Note: On the farms of South Louisianna, this savor jellied meat is made
  from the head of a hog.  The following recipe uses instead fresh pigs feet,
  tongue and heart, because these ingredietns are more readily available from
  most retail butchers.
  
  Place the pigs feet, heart and tongue in an 8-10 qt. enameled or stainless
  steel pot and add the water, 1/4 c. of the salt, the vinegar and 1 T. of
  the lemon juice.  Bring to a boil over high heat, meanwhile skimming off
  the foam and scum as they rise to the surface. Then reduce the heat to low,
  cover partially, and simmer for about 4 hours, or until all the meats are
  tender and show no resistance when pierced deeply with the point of a sharp
  knife.
  
  With tongs, transfer the tongue, feet and heart to a cutting board. Measure
  and reserve 3 1/2 c. of the cooking liquid.  While it is still warm, skin
  the tongue with a small sharp knife, cutting away the fat, bones and
  bristle at its base.  Cut or pull off the meat from the pigs feet and
  discard the bones, skin, gristle and fat. Slice the pigs heart lengthwise
  into quarters and cut away the arteries and veins and any pieces of fat.
  Cut all the meats into small chunks and put them through the coarsest
  bladeof a food grinder. There should be about 5 1/2 c. of ground meat.
  
  In a heavy 12" skillet, melt the butter over moderate heat.  Add the onions
  and, stirring frequently, cook for about 5 minutes, or until they are soft
  and translucent but not brown.
  
  Pour in 1/2 c. of the reserved cooking liquid and, stirring from time to
  time, simmer over low heat for 15-20 minutes, until almost all of the
  liquid has evaporated.
  
  Stir in the ground meat, the remaining 3 c. of cooking liquid, 3 T. of
  lemon juice and 2 ts. of salt.  Add the bay leaf, sage, mace and red and
  black pepper, and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to low
  and simmer, partially covered, for 10 minutes longer.
  
  Remove the skillet from the heat, stir in the parsley and scallions, and
  taste for seasoning.  With a rubber spatula, transfer the entire contents
  of the skillet to a 9x9x2 baking dish and smooth the top with the spatula.
   Cool to room temperature, then cover with foil or plastic wrap and
  refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until the headcheese is thoroughly
  chilled and firm to the touch.
  
  To unmold and serve the headcheese, run a thin-bladed knife around the
  edges of the dish to loosen the sides and dip the bottom briefly into hot
  water.  Place an inverted platter on top of the dish and, grasping the
  platter and dish together firmly, tun them over.  The headcheese should
  slide out of the dish easily.
  
  Slice the headcheese thin and serve it with crackers or toast.

      Title: Hidatsa Stuffed Sugar Pumpkin
 Categories: Native, Meat, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
---------------------------SPIRIT OF THE HARVEST---------------------------
      1    Sugar pumpkin, 4-5 pounds
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Dry mustard
      2 tb Rendered fat
      1 lb Ground buffalo, venison or
           -beef
      1    Medium onion, chopped
      1 c  Cooked wild rice
      3    Eggs, beaten
      1 ts Crushed, dried sage
    1/4 ts Pepper
 
  Preheat oven to 350 deg F. Cut the top off the pumpkin and remove strings
  and seeds. Reserve seeds for another use. Prick the cavity with a fork and
  rub with 1 teaspoon salt and the mustard. Heat fat in a large skillet, add
  meat and onion and saute over medium-high heat until browned. Off the heat,
  stir in wild rice, eggs, remaining salt, sage and pepper. Stuff pumpkin
  with the meat mixture. Place 1/2" water in the bottom of a shallow baking
  pan. Put pumpkin in the pan and bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until tender. Add
  more water to the pan as neccessary to avoid sticking. To serve, cut
  pumpkin into wedges, giving each person pumpkin and stuffing.
  
  Art's notes: I've not tried either of these, since at the time pumpkin was
  not available in this area. I have however, used a Columbian Squash
  (resembled pumpkin in appearance and texture of meat) as a substitute.

      Title: Home-Cured Corned Beef
 Categories: Beef, Makemeat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lb Beef roast
      4 tb Curing salt
      6 ea Garlic cloves, peeled
      3 ea Bay leaves
    1/8 ts Whole cloves (3)
      2 tb Whole coriander seeds
      2 tb Whole peppercorns
      1 tb Whole mustard seeds
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
 
  Combine garlic, bay leaves, cloves, coriander seeds, peppercorns, and
  mustard seed in blender.  Blend until coarsly chopped.  Add brown sugar.
  Set aside.
  
  Trim roast (venison, beef, etc.), weigh and measure 1 level Tablespoon of
  curing salt per pound.  Add measured curing salt to spice mixture you set
  aside.
  
  Rub spice mixture into roast, pressing in well. Measure roast at thickest
  point.  Place into heavy freezing bag and close securely. Place in shallow
  pan in refrigerator.  Cure 5 days per inch of measured thickness, turning
  bag daily.
  
  At end of curing time wrap and freeze.
  
  To cook:  Drain juices, if desired rinse thoroughly under cold running
  water to remove extra salt and spice pieces, wrap in foil and bake sealed
  at 300 degrees 2 to 3 hours or until tender.  Or use in any corned beef
  recipe.
  
  Dorothy's comments: This recipe has been tested by my whole family on both
  beef and venison with the results that if I do not have one either in
  process or residing in the freezer ready for instant cooking I certainly
  hear about my oversight!  It has become the most requested top of the list
  for both Birthday and Christmas giftlists. For ease in converting the ratio
  of meat to spices I have set my serving size to the most often used size of
  roast by my family.  I have used this on several different cuts of meat,
  however, our favorite is bottom round. Recently I became lazy and instead
  of grinding the spices in my blender I left them whole. The result was
  exactly the same in flavor and since I hate to bite into a spice by mistake
  and rinse them off before I cook the corned beef, it made the rinsing task
  a whole lot easier! I haven't tried using brisket myself, however since
  that seems to be the only cut of meat that you can get as corned beef in
  the supermarkets around where I live, I imagine it would work fine.
  Actually, avoiding brisket was one reason I decided to corn all my own meat
  at home! IMHO briskets "might" make good doorstops! Seriously though, the
  main reason we don't care for brisket is only because mostly it has a high
  amount of fat. The corning process does such a good job of tenderizing that
  there is no problem with the toughness. Our favorite cut of meat to corn is
  the bottom round since it seems to be a leaner cut of meat. Usually I just
  cook the corned beef in the oven with a few potatoes, carrots and celery
  with it.  Or my husband likes to wrap it in foil and cook it on the
  barbecue grill, unwrapping and browning it the last 15 to
       20    minutes of the cooking time.
  
  Sylvia's comments: on brisket, it produced a very flavorful corned beef,
  usable after about 12 hours in the crockpot.

      Title: Honey-Orange Lamb
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
    3/4 c  Pinot noir (Burgundy)
    1/4 c  Orange juice
           -(juice of 1 orange)
      2 tb Lemon juice (juice
           -of 1 lemon)
      2 tb Honey
      1 ts Mustard, dry
      1 c  Tomato puree
           -(puree of 1 tomato)
      3    Garlic cloves
           -(or more to taste)
    1/4 ts Black pepper, ground
      1    Half leg of lamb,
           -butterflied
 
  Mix together all of the ingredients except the lamb.  Place the lamb in a
  bowl or pan that will not be corroded by the marinade (a glass 9x13 pan
  works well). Pour the marinade over the lamb. Cover and marinate in the
  refrigerator for 12 hours, turning occasionally.
  
  Start a fire in the grill and get the coals very warm but not flaming.
  Place lamb on grill about 3-4 inches from the coals. Cook 20 minutes on
  each side.
  
  After 10 minutes on the second side, start checking for doneness. Contrary
  to many people's ideas, lamb should not be well done but should still be a
  little pink. When done, slice thin and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- This recipe is the same as Anita
  Cochran's recipe for grilled butterflied leg of lamb, except that it uses a
  different marinade.  I got the marinade recipe from a local wine merchant.
  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  This marinade also works well with chicken.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 40 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: Honey-Orange Pork Chops
 Categories: Main dish, Meat, Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 ts Finely shredded orange peel
    1/2 c  Orange juice
    1/4 c  Pineapple juice
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Honey
    1/8 ts Pepper
      2 cl Garlic; minced
      4    Pork loin chops; cut 3/4"
           -thick (about 1 1/2 lbs)
      1 tb Cornstarch
 
  (I use 3/4 cup of pineapple-orange juice instead of using separate
  pineapple and orange juice.) Trim fat from chops. For marinade, in a
  shallow baking dish combine orange peel, orange juice, pineapple juice, soy
  sauce, honey, pepper, and garlic. Add meat; turn to coat. Cover; chill in
  the refrigerator for 6 to 24 hours, turning once.
  
  Remove meat from marinade, reserving marinade.  Place meat on the unheated
  rack of a broiler pan.  Broil 4 to 5 inches from the heat for 12 to 14
  minutes or till no pink remains, turning once.
  
  Transfer marinade to a saucepan.  Stir in cornstarch.  Cook and stir until
  thickened and bubbly.  Cook and stir 2 minutes more.  Pass with chops.
  
  Grill directions:  Prepare chops as above.  Grill on an uncovered grill
  directly over medium-hot coals for 12 to 14 minutes or till no pink
  remains; turn once.  Continue as above.

      Title: Hot Sesame Seed Beef
 Categories: Meat, Stir-fry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 tb Rice wine
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      5 ts Sesame oil
      5 ts Soy sauce

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      1 tb Sesame seeds
  1 1/2 ts Hot bean paste
  1 1/2 ts Hoisin sauce
  1 1/2 ts Oyster sauce

------------------------------------BEEF------------------------------------
      1 ts Minced ginger
    2/3 lb Beef tenderloin
           -flank
           Peanut oil (2-4 T)
      4    Lettuce leaves
           -(or less; use
           -bok-choy if you
           -can get it)
 
  Mix together all of the marinade ingredients.  Slice the beef across the
  grain into thin, diagonal pieces (about the size of your smallest finger).
  Marinate for about half an hour.
  
  Heat the wok until a drop of water dropped into it dances around as it
  boils. Add enough oil to coat the wok and saute the ginger. Stir-fry the
  lettuce. Stir-fry the beef (in batches so the wok doesn't cool down too
  much).
  
  Reduce the heat.  Return the vegetables to the wok.  Add the topping. Stir
  around until everything is mixed and heated evenly.  Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very hot, very simple, very good beef stir-fry -- This recipe has been
  floating around for years back east, where it's also known as Hot Flaming
  Death.
  
  *  Also add any other vegetables that you feel like.  Sliced carrots or
  broccoli are especially nice.
  
  *  Hot bean paste also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc. This is
  the main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care. Vary this
  ingredient to taste.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  preparation:  20 minutes, cooking:  3 minutes.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: House Special Lo Mein
 Categories: Chinese, Meat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Chinese egg noodles (dried,
           Not fresh)
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Oil
      2 oz Raw lean pork, in
           Matchsticks
      2 oz Raw lean beef, in
           Matchbook-cover sized
           Pieces
      2 oz Raw chicken, in small pieces
           Any which shape
      2 oz Raw shelled shrimp (cooked
           Will do)
      2 ts Dry sherry
      2 ts Cornstarch
      4 tb Oil
      2 oz Button mushrooms, sliced
           (reconstituted Chinese ones
           Are better but
           Are quite expensive)
      2 c  Chinese cabbage, shredded
           (can substitute regular
           Cabbage, blanched)
      2    Scallions, cut into
           Matchsticks (green and white
           Part both, no roots)
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts MSG (substitute chicken
           Bouillon granules)
    1/4 lb Raw bean sprouts
 
  (this an adaptation of Joyce Chen's recipe) I was served half of this as a
  "half order" for $4.65, and it was too much, so I suppose it makes enough
  for about 3 as a main course
  
  Bring a lot of water to the boil. Dump noodles in; turn heat to low. Cook 3
  minutes. Drain, toss with sesame oil and regular oil, set aside.
  
  In 4 separate dishes, combine each of the meats with 1/2 t sherry and
      1/2 t  cornstarch.
  
  Heat the 4 T oil in a skillet or wok to high. Add meats in this order,
  stirring for a few seconds between each addition: pork, beef, chicken,
  shrimp. As soon as you've added and tossed the shrimp, add the mushrooms
  and cabbage. Cook until cabbage is wilted. Add scallions, soy, salt, and
  MSG. Stir. Add the noodles and the bean sprouts, and stir-cook for 3 min.
  Serve hot on a warm platter.

      Title: Hungarian Goulasch (Gulyas)#2+
 Categories: Ethnic, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 ts Dried marjoram
      1 ts Caraway seeds
      1 ts Lemon zest
      1 cl Garlic
    3/4 c  Butter
      1 tb Tomato paste
      1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
      2 lb Onions, sliced
      1 c  Water
      2 lb Beef (rump, round or chuck)
           -lamb or veal is nice too
      1 c  Sweet red and green pepper
           -chunks (or peppers of your
           -choice)
           Salt to taste
 
  Crush together the marjoram, caraway, garlic and lemon zest.
  
  In a large kettle, combine the butter (or fat of your choice), 1 tb. tomato
  paste, the crushed seasonings and the sliced onions. Saute the onions,
  stirring all the while, until the onions are golden. Add the paprika, stir
  and saute 30 seconds longer. Add the beef, lamb or veal, (cut in uniform
  chunks), the water and salt to taste. Cover the kettle tightly and simmer
  for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Add a bit more water during
  cooking, only if it is necessary. Just before the goulasch is done, add 1/2
  cup more water and let the sauce boil up once more. If more sauce is
  preferred, sprinkle it with 1/4 cup flour just before the water is added at
  the end and add 1 more cup of water.
  
  Serve the goulasch with speaetzle, noodles or boiled potatoes. Our personal
  preferance (and one that is commonly used in Vienna) is zemmel knoedle
  (kaiser roll dumplings.)
  
  In Hungary, slivered grteen peppers are sprinkled on this gulyas. It may
  also be sprinkle with bits of sweet red pepper.
  
  This recipe was carefully put together by studying several gulyas recipes
  and eating many variations of it in Vienna where the Riemermans fell in
  love with the dish. You can still play with it as we are as we intend to
  keep doing.
  
  The best one I ever had was at the Prater in Vienna. It was lamb, served
  with a not so hot long pickled pepper, a large semmel knoedle, and a half a
  weiner, mysteriousely cut to look like a swan.

      Title: Indian Jerky
 Categories: Native, Meat, Game, Preserves
      Yield: 50 Pounds
 
      3 ga Water
      2 lb Dry brown sugar
      1 oz Saltpeter
      1 oz Cayenne pepper
      1 c  Juniper berries, crushed
      1    Whole piece ginger
 
  Bring water to a boil and add remining ingredients. Boil for 5 minutes.
  Remove scum as it appears.  Cool and store in a wooden barrel or
  earthenware crock.
  
  Jerky is dried meat, cut in long strips from large game or beef.  To
  prepare sun-dried jerky, cut fresh meat into long thi  strips about an inch
  wide and an inch thick.  Rub the strips with salt and hang, spaced well
  apart on racks, in the sun to dry.  When dry, store in sacks hung in a dry
  place.
  
  Jerky can also be made by placing the strips in a corning solution for 3 or
  4 days, then hung on racks over a slow burning smoky fire for about 2 days.
  The strips should be placed well apart to keep them from touching each
  other.  When dry, the strips should be wrapped in a protective covering
  such as cheesecloth to keep insects and dirt from settling on them.
  
  Jerky will keep dry as long as it is exposed to the air and smoke. It is
  important not to leave it longer than a couple of days.  Then take it down
  and store it in air-tight jars or other containers.

      1    Onion, chopped
      2 tb Red peppers, crushed

  browns a little more during this time.

  everyone, even from people who normally don't like hot food. Yield: Serves
  6-8.

      Title: Italian Sausage with Peppers and Onions
 Categories: Meat, European
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Mild Italian Sausage
      3    4 large onions (Vidalia if
           Available)
      2    3 medium green bell peppers
      1 lb Fresh mushrooms (optional)
  1 1/2 ts Garlic powder, or 2 cloves
           Fresh crushed garlic
      1 ts Coarse ground black pepper
           (best fresh ground from
           Mill)
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
      1    10-oz  bottle Sierra Nevada
           Pale Ale
           (May substitute any
           Non-major chain brand ale
           Locally available;
           Don't use the really good
           Drinking stuff for this.)
 
  Coarsely chop onions and cut bell peppers into strips not wider than 1/2".
  Mushrooms may be sliced or left whole, at chef's option. Lightly fry
  sausage in skillet over medium heat, until outer casing begins to brown.
  Layer onions, pepper strips, and sausage into the crockpot, sprinkling
  spices at each layer.  Add contents of ale bottle to pot, cover, and set to
  low heat for 7-8 hours.
  
  These quantities are designed to fill a standard 5-quart crockpot, and will
  serve 4-6 people.  This goes very well with fresh garlic bread. From:

      Title: Italian Style Dry Sausage
 Categories: Makemeat
      Yield: 10 Pounds
 
      8 lb Lean pork, cubed
      2 lb Cubed pork fat
      5 tb Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      5 ts Fennel seed
      2 ts Anise seed
      1 tb Garlic, finely minced
      2 tb Coarse grind black pepper
      1 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 ts Ascorbic acid
      1 ts Saltpeter
      6    Feet medium hog casings
 
  Grind meat and fat separately through the coarse disk. Mix together with
  remaining ingredients. Spread mixture in a large pan, cover loosley with
  waxed paper and cure in the fridge for 24 hours. Prepare casings, stuff and
  twist into 4" lengths. tie each off with cotton twine. Hang the links 6-8
  weeks, checking after six weeks by cutting in half. If the texture is firm
  enough to suit your taste, the remaining sausage may be cut down and
  wrapped tightly for storage in the refrigerator. Prolonged drying will
  result in a sausage that has the texture of something like beef jerky, at
  which time you can either gnaw on it like a dog with a bone or use it to
  club intruders.

      Title: Jane Grigson's English Brine
 Categories: Pork, Preserves, Meat, Uk
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      7 pt Water
  1 1/2 lb Sea or coarse salt
      1 lb Dark brown sugar
      2 oz Saltpeter
      1    Bayleaf
      1    Sprig thyme
     10    Juniper berries; crushed
     10    Peppercorns; crushed
 
  Boil hard for 5 minutes. Leave to cool. Clean crock or bucket and lid with
  soda dissolved in boiling water, rinse well, and leave to DRAIN dry.
    Pour in cold brine, though a muslin lined strainer. Immerse the meat
  (duck, pork, beef, mutton) and keep it below the surface by laying a piece
  of boiled wood, or scrupulously clean plate on top. Cover and keep in a dry
  place at a temperature below 60øF
    Salting time.
    ============ This depends on the thickness of the meat. Trotters, 24 hrs,
  a leg of pork can take 10 days. NB. Joints required for roasting rather
  than boiling will be improved by a 12 hour soak in brine, without tasting
  too salty afterwards.
  
  In home conditions, in a cool larder, meat can be kept in brine for up to a
  fortnight or three weeks, sometimes longer. The moments islands of white
  mould begin to float on the surface,  remove meat and throw away the brine.
  The crock will need washing in boiling soda again. The meat will be OK.

      Title: Jeff's Chicken Fried Steak
 Categories: Southern, Meat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Round steak
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Milk
      1    Egg
      1 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
           Oil for cooking

--------------------------------CREAM GRAVY--------------------------------
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Water
    1/4 c  Flour
           Salt
           Pepper
 
    Heat 1/4 inch oil in heavy frying pan to medium high.
  
    Combine 1 cup milk with the egg, whisk to mix.  Pour into 9" round
  shallow pan.
  
    Season 1 cup flour with the garlic powder, salt and pepper. Sift together
  into 9" round shallow pan.
  
    Tenderize the round steak well, trimming off excess fat and ligament.
  
    Dip the meat into the egg and milk mixture, then dredge in the seasoned
  flour, pressing the flour into the meat.  Repeat for a crispier coating.
  
    When oil is hot, place the meat into oil, adjusting temp. to allow the
  meat to cook for 9-12 minutes.  This allows additional tenderizing of the
  meat.
  
    When fried steak is golden brown, remove to drain on paper towels.
  
    CREAM GRAVY:
  
    Pour off all but 4 tablespoons of the cooking oil from the pan. Over
  medium heat, slowly stir in the 1/4 cup flour, stirring constantly.
  
    Combine the 1 cup milk and 1 cup water, slowly add to oil/flour mix,
  stirring constantly.  Stirring with a large spatula helps.  Loosen brown
  bits from bottom of pan while stirring, there's great flavor there.
  
    Add salt and pepper to taste, raising heat to bring to a boil.  When
  bubbly, lower heat and continue to stir, simmering for 5 minutes.
  
    It's traditional to serve the meat with mashed potatoes, covering the
  meat and potatoes with the gravy.  Large yeast rolls go great with this
  meal too.
  
    Well worth the effort!
  
  Enjoy!   Jeff Duke

      Title: Jeff's Favorite Barbecue Brisket
 Categories: Bbq, Meat, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 lb Beef brisket
           Smoker for cooking
     10 lb Charcoal
    1/4 lb Mesquite wood
           Basting sauce
           Barbecue sauce
 
  This is a perfect way to spend a day, and makes a meal fit for a king!
  
  It really takes a smoker to make this successfully, but creative folks can
  use whatever's handy.
  
  Select a good quality beef brisket.  Trim off excess fat and store in
  refrigerator until ready to barbecue.
  
  If you wish, marinade the meat for additional flavor or tenderness. A good
  marinade can consist of water, Worcestershire Sauce, Soy Sauce, pepper,
  lime or lemon juice - whatever you like!  (No Salt, though)
  
  Start 8 lbs. of the charcoal and allow coals to develop gray ash over all
  before beginning to cook.  Reserve the remaining 2 lbs. for adding when
  needed later.  Add wood that has been soaking in water for an hour or so.
  
  Cook the meat on a grate approx. 8 inches over the coals, adding charcoal
  and wood to fire as needed.  It isn't necessary to keep a heavy smoke at
  all times, just 1/2 of the cooking time.  Use a meat thermometer to
  determine doneness of meat to your preference.  If the smoker has an
  indicator for temperature, a low heat is fine.  Coals and wood tend to burn
  at lower temperatures when enclosed in a smoker.
  
    While cooking, it is essential to baste often with the basting sauce.
  Usually every 10 minutes or even less will ensure a juicy and delicious
  brisket.
  
    If basting with another sauce, remember that anything containing sugar or
  tomato will burn, leaving a scorched flavor.  That's especially true with
  meats cooked over long periods of time.
  
    Serve with the warmed barbecue sauce and breads, beans, salad or
  potatoes.
  
  Enjoy!    Jeff Duke

  juices. Add the cream, and stir to incorporate it into the sauce; do not
  allow to boil. Finally, add the black currant jam.

      Title: Kathy Pitt's Chicken Fried Steak
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
 
  Begin with a good-sized hunk of round steak, the steak should be at least
  1/2 inch thick.  Cut the steak into serving-sized pieces.
  
  Now the fun begins.  I use a method of tenderizing the meat passed on to me
  by my father, who made great CFS -- first, score the exterior of the meat
  with tiny, diamond-shaped patterns (like you'd use to score the fat on a
  ham, but make the diamonds only about 1/4 inch long.) Do this to both sides
  of the meat.  Then pound the heck out of the meat using the heaviest
  implement you can find (a heavy saucer, the handle of a BIG knife or -- my
  personal favorite -- a clean claw hammer).
  
  The meat should be pounded until it almost, but not quite, gives up and
  falls to pieces.
  
  Now mix up a quantity of seasoned flour (salt, pepper, maybe some paprika
  and garlic powder).  Also beat a couple of whole eggs with a couple of
  tablespoons of water.
  
  Dip the pounded meat first in the flour, then in the egg, then back in the
  flour.  For a really crisp crust, dip again in the egg, and back in the
  flour (this is optional, but I almost always do it, to me, the crust is the
  best part of the dish).  Allow the breaded meat to sit for a few minutes to
  set up the breading.
  
  Melt some oil, bacon grease or lard in a heavy frying pan. Use enough to
  cover the pan to the depth of 1/4 inch.  When the fat is hot, but not
  smoking, place some of the meat in the pan.  Do not overcrowd, and do not
  allow the individual pieces of steak to touch.
  
  Cook on one side until nicely browned, turn and cook the second side.
  Remove the cooked steak to a warm place, and continue cooking the remainder
  until all is done.  Add more fat to the pan as needed.
  
  Add 2 Tbsp. of flour to every 2 Tbsp. of fat left in the pan (stir to
  scrape up the little browned, crispy bits that are sticking to the pan,
  too).  Cook this mixture briefly to get rid of the raw flour taste, but do
  not allow it to brown.  Stir in milk (about 1 cup to each 2 Tbsp. of flour)
  to make a gravy.  Season to taste with salt, black pepper (lots of black
  pepper), and serve gravy of the meat and the mashed potatoes you're going
  to serve on the side.

      Title: Kathy Pitts Beef Wellington
 Categories: Meat, Pitts
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Tenderloin steaks, thick
           -(at least 1 inch, 1 1/2
           -inches is better)
      1 pk Puff pastry shells, frozen
           -Pepperidge farm
      1 cn Liver pate w/truffles
           -imported
      4    Mushrooms, fresh; very
           -finely minced
      1    Shallot (or the white part
           -of 2 small green onions)
           -finely minced
           Butter; clarified, several
           -tablespoons
      1    Eggs, beaten w/ a tables-
           -poon of cold water
 
  *(chicken or pork liver pate is okay, goose is better, pate de foie gros is
  best.)
  
  Heat the clarified butter in a frying pan, and saute the steaks on each
  side until well browned (you don't really want to cook 'em, just brown them
  ).  Remove the steaks from the pan, and chill well. Meanwhile, in the same
  pan (add a bit more butter if needed,) cook the mushrooms and shallot until
  well browned and dry.  Set aside.
  
  Thaw the puff pastry shells, and, one at a time, roll them on a floured
  board until about 1/4 inch thick.  Chill briefly.
  
  Remove one of the rolled pastry rounds from the refrigerator, and place it
  in the center of a lightly floured board.  Place half the mushroom/shallot
  mixture in the center of the pastry.
  
  Remove one of the steaks from the refrigerator, and spread the top of the
  steak with about a 1/4 inch thick layer of pate.  Place the steak, pate
  side down, on top of the mushroom/shallot mixture.
  
  Draw the pastry around the sides of the steak, trim off most of the overlap
  at the top, leaving maybe a 1/2 inch of pastry on the top side (this is
  tougher to explain than to do, but I think you get the picture.) Save the
  dough trimmings for later.
  
  Brush the overlapping dough with the egg/water mixture, and place a second
  round of dough on top of it to cover the unwrapped portion of the steak.
  Cut off the excess. and pinch firmly to join the two pieces.
  
  Turn the whole thing over (pate side up), and refrigerate while you do the
  second steak.
  
  After the second steak is done and resting in the refrigerator, preheat
  your oven to whatever temperature (425, I think, but I can't remember
  exactly) the package of puff pastry shells recommends. While the oven is
  preheating, roll the scraps of leftover pastry out, and cut into decorative
  leaf, flower or whatever other shapes suit you.
  
  Remove the individual Wellingtons from the refrigerator, brush the top and
  sides with egg, cut a couple of decorative slits in each to vent the steam,
  and decorate the top with the pastry scraps.  Brush the scraps lightly with
  egg to glaze, place the Wellingtons on a baking sheet, and bake until
  browned. (Again, refer to the pastry box for timing here, it doesn't take
  more than about 20 minutes, though).
  
  Serve, if you like, with a Bordelaise or Maderia sauce on the side. (Knorr
  makes decent versions of both ;-)

      Title: Kathy Pitts Brisket
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 lb Brisket, lean
           Onion, green; cut into
           -thin strips
           Chili peppers, Serrano
           -cut into thin strips

------------------------------------RUB------------------------------------
      2 tb Lemon Pepper seasoning
      2 tb Paprika, sweet

----------------------------------MARINATE----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Liquid smoke
    1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
 
  I began with a 3-4 lb. hunk of very lean brisket (cut and de-fatted it
  myself from a primal cut brisket we'd gotten at a bargain price). Marinated
  the thing for 3-4 hours in a mixture of half liquid smoke marinade
  (Figaro's) and half Worcestershire sauce, turning occasionally.
  
  I then cut slits in the brisket, and inserted thin strips of green onion
  and serrano chili peppers (a trick I picked up from one of the good folks
  on the echo).  Rubbed it down very liberally with a mixture of lemon pepper
  seasoning and sweet paprika, and wrapped it drug-store style in heavy duty
  aluminum foil.
  
  I placed the brisket in a rimmed baking dish (actually a cast-iron skillet)
  and cooked it in a preheated 250 degree (F) oven for 16 hours. About an
  hour before the meal, I opened the foil package, and grabbed some of the
  juices that had formed inside.
  
  Mixed the juices with about the same quantity of catsup, some more liquid
  smoke, some garlic powder, a little vinegar, a good-sized shot of Tabasco,
  and just a hint of brown sugar, and simmered this whole mess together for a
  barbecue sauce.
  
  The brisket was wonderful.  The peppers and onions had melted into the
  meat, leaving it nice and moist, and so tender it could be cut with a fork.
  The only thing I'd do differently next time is that I believe I'd rouse
  myself to build a small, VERY smoky fire with a lot of soaked hickory or
  mesquite chips outdoors, and cool-smoke the meat for maybe 30 minutes just
  to give it a more pronounced smokey flavor.
  
  I've cooked on a competition barbecue team that managed to place at the
  World Championship Barbecue Cook-Off at the Houston Astrodome, and I can
  say without reservation, that this was one of the best, most hassle-free
  briskets I've yet produced.

      Title: Kathy's Chipped Beef
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Dried beef (I use
           Budding's)
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      2 tb Flour
      1 c  Milk*
           Salt (it won't need much)
           White pepper to taste
      1 pn Dry mustard
 
  *(for a more authentic military flavor, use canned evaporated milk)
  
  Remove the beef from the package, and tear into shreds. Melt the butter,
  and briefly saute the beef in the butter (it should just become slightly
  crispy).  Add the flour, and stir until the whole mess congeals slightly
  and begins to look a little like wet beach sand (DO NOT brown the flour).
  
  Stir in the milk, and whisk until smooth.  Season to taste with salt,
  pepper, and dry mustard.  Simmer briefly until thickened and all the floury
  taste is removed.
  
  Serve over mashed potatoes, rice, biscuits or toast.
  
  NOTE:  For a better, but distinctly non-military version of this dish, toss
  in a couple of generous handfuls of grated cheddar cheese, and a few grains
  of cayenne pepper.

  1 1/2 lb 85% lean ground beef;
      2 md Eggs; beaten slightly
    1/2 c  Onion; chopped finely
    1/4 c  Celery; chopped finely
      2 ts Worcestershire sauce;
      1 tb Catup
 
  Preheat oven to 350 f degree.  Line a shallow 8-inch baking pan with foil.
  Dissolve beef bouillion cube in boiling water in a large bowl. Add all
  other ingrediets except the catsup and blend well with a fork. Turn onto
  foil in pan and, with hands, shape quickly into a 6 by 4 1/2 inch by 2 inch
  loaf.  With the dull edge of a knife make a crisscross pattern across the
  top, spread with catup across the top. Cover loaf with a tent of foil that
  does not touch the top. Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil; bake, uncovered,
  another 45 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool in pan for 2-3 minutes
  before serving.  Using this molded metheod instead of loaf pan allows the
  fat to drain from the loaf, whereas a loaf pan retains fat.

      Title: Kielbasa (Barry Strittmatter 1)
 Categories: Meat, Makemeat
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      8 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar
      4 ts Pepper
      4 ts Majoram
      1 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Allspice
      4 tb Garlic
      4 lb Pork
      2 lb Pork fat
      2 lb Beef
 
  Combine pork, fat, and beef.  Add all spices and mix well by hand. Pass
  through grinder on course blade.  Stuff into casings. (hint.--After cubing
  meat, place in freezer until the center of the meat and fat is firm. This
  makes grinding easier in that it lessens the blades from becoming
  "clogged")  Most Kielbasa recipes say that the secret to making good
  Kielbasa is to ground the meat twice.  I prefer the course texture attained
  by a single grinding.  Other sausages I grind twice.

      Title: Kosher Salami
 Categories: Makemeat
      Yield: 10 Pounds
 
      8 lb Lean boneless beef chuck,
           -cubed
      2 lb Beef fat, cubed
      5 tb Salt
  1 1/2 ts Finely minced garlic
      1 tb Finely ground white pepper
  1 1/2 ts Coarsely crushed white peppr
      1 tb Coarse grind coriander seed
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
      1 c  Dry white wine
    1/2 ts Ascorbic acid
      1 ts Saltpeter
      4    Feet large beef casings
 
  "This recipe makes real kosher salami if you have access to
  kosher-butchered beef. If not, then just like kosher dill pickles, it's the
  flavor that counts."
  
  Grind the beef through the fine disk. Grind the ft through the coarse disk.
  Mix the dry ingredients with the wine and pour this mixture over the meat
  and fat. Mix well. Spread in pan and cure in the refrigerator 24-48 hours.
  Prepare casings, stuff and tie off into 8-9" links. Hang to dry for one
  week. Wipe the sausage dry and smoke over a cool (120) smoke about 8 hours.
  Increase smoking temperature to 150-160 and smoke for an additional four
  hours. Because the smoking aids in the drying process, the salami should be
  ready to eat after about three weeks of additional drying.

      Title: Lagos/kounelli Fournou (Baked Hare or Rabbit)
 Categories: Meat, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1    Rabbit or hare
           -- cleaned and skinned
      2    Celery stalks, with leaves,
           -- chopped
      2 md Onions; chopped
      1    Carrot; sliced
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1    Bay leaf; crumbled
      2    Sprigs fresh rosemary
      6    Peppercorns; bruised
      2 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Vinegar
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      4    Fresh tomatoes; chopped -OR-
      8 oz -Tomato sauce
      3    Allspice berries
 
  After washing the rabbit or hare thoroughly and cutting into serving
  pieces, place in a large glass or earthenware bowl.  Make a marinade by
  combining the celery, onions, carrots, herbs, peppercorns, wine, and
  vinegar and pouring over the meat.  Cover and refrigerate for a day or two,
  turning the pieces over occasionally.
  
  On serving day, drain, reserving the marinade, and wipe dry. Transfer the
  marinade to a casserole and simmer for 15 minutes. While the marinade is
  cooking, heat the butter in a large frying pan, and when very hot sear the
  meat over high heat until it is reddened in color without browning. Remove
  from the heat, and with a spatula lift the rabbit or hare pieces into the
  simmering marinade, then pour in the remaining butter. Taste for seasoning,
  then add the salt and pepper, tomatoes, and allspice. Weight the meat with
  a small plate to keep it under the sauce, then bake it in a very slow oven
  (225 F) for 2-1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the sauce
  thickened.

  Continue cooking the meat while stirring, to brown the flour a bit. Add
  vinegar and water.  Stir thoroughly.  Cover, lower heat, and simmer 1 hour
  or until meat is tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

  NOTES:
  
  *  An Easy Lamb Stew -- I got this recipe from my mom.  I'm not sure where
  she got it. It's not a typical cacciatore (i.e. smothered in tomato sauce);
  instead, it's tart and tastes of herbs.  It smells great when it's cooking.
  It's very easy to make.  Yield:  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20-30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: Lamb Sans Mint
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Leg of lamb,
           -butterflied and
           -trimmed
      6 tb Rosemary
           Black pepper
           Green onions
      4 c  Burgundy wine
      2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
      6    Garlic cloves, sliced
      1 tb Oregano
      1 tb Thyme
      1 c  Onion, minced
 
  Carefully trimming the fat from a butterflied leg of lamb, and and finish
  the cut, as needed, so that the lamb lies flat in a butterfly shape. A
  large butterflied leg of lamb should be no more than about 2 or 3 inches
  thick.
  
  Take a liberal amount of rosemary, crush it and rub it into the lamb. When
  crushing it, don't turn it into dust, just break it.  Sprinkle some black
  pepper on the cut side of the meat.
  
  Combine the remaining ingredients (wine, green onions, olive oil, lemon
  juice, garlic, oregano, thyme and onion) into a marinade. Place the lamb in
  a shallow dish or bowl, cover as much as possible with the marinade, and
  marinate in a refrigerator, covered, for 4 to 24 hours. Turn at intervals
  to marinate evenly.
  
  Grill over mesquite and charcoal on a grill with a tight-fitting lid, such
  as a Weber. Cook on one side for 25 minutes, occasionally spooning some
  leftover marinade onto the uncooked side, then turn and cook about 20 more
  minutes. cooking. Make a small cut in the thickest part of the lamb to
  check for doneness: when the center is still pink, but not raw, take the
  lamb off and prepare to serve. Remember that the lamb will continue to cook
  after you take it off the grill.
  
  Serve the lamb cut-side down (pretty side up).  Garnish with uncooked green
  onions.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- I devised this recipe after being
  unable to find an appropriate recipe in the library. It is always well
  received, and it looks impressive far out of proportion to its difficulty.
  Because it is simple and difficult to screw up, it is perfect as the
  centerpiece for a meal with a large group or with complex side dishes.
  Serve with a hearty rice pilaf and a vegetable. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  Your butcher can butterfly a leg of lamb for you.  Tell him you will be
  cooking it flat, and not rolling it back up into a roast. Ask him to be
  careful.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have a good butcher.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 45 minutes roasting.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: Lamb Vindaloo
 Categories: Meat, Indian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Lamb, cubed
      2 tb Coriander seed
      1 tb Cumin seed
      2 lb Tomatoes, crushed
     14    Garlic cloves, crushed
      6    Bay leaves
           Ginger (fresh), 2 inches,
           -finely chopped
    1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
    1/2 ts Cardamon seed
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Cloves
    1/2 ts Cayenne
      2 ts Mustard seed, ground
      1 tb Turmeric
      1 c  Wine vinegar
      2 md Onions
      2 md Potatoes
      2 tb Butter
 
  Lightly roast the cumin seed and coriander seed by frying with no oil for a
  minute or so, stirring constantly.  Grind these and combine them into a
  paste with the other spices, the garlic, ginger and the vinegar. Add the
  lamb to the marinade and mix well. Refrigerate for 3-24 hours while mixing
  every few hours as convenient.
  
  Finely chop the onions and potatoes and saute them for 5 minutes in the
  butter.
  
  Add lamb and spice paste and simmer over low heat for half an hour. The
  marinating does add a lot of flavor and makes the meat much more tender.
  This can be skipped if need be.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spicy hot Indian lamb dish -- Very loosely based on Dharamjit Singh's
  recipe in "Indian Cookery:  A Practical Guide."  Most restaurants that
  serve this dish pronounce it vinDAloo, with the stress on the second
  syllable.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy (though it's easy to burn the spices while roasting
  them).
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 1 day marinating, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Steak, Lemon
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Steaks
      2 tb Oil
      2 tb Butter (or margarine)
      1 ts Dijon mustard
      1 cl Garlic, minced (or more)
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Cracked black pepper
      4 ts Lemon juice
      2 ts Worcestershire sauce
        ds Tobasco (optional)
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
 
  Trim fat from steaks;pat dry with towel. Slash edges to prevent curling
  (if steaks are thin). In large skillet, combine oil, butter, mustard,
  garlic, salt & pepper. Heat until bubbly. Saute steaks for 4-5 min. Turn
  and cook until done the way you like 'em. Remove steaks; keep warm. Into
  saucepan, stir lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce & Tobasco if used. Pour
  over steaks; sprinkle with parsley.
  
  I think adding the lemon juice & Worcestershire directly to the  skillet
  and combining with the drippings makes a yummier sauce.

      Title: Lihapiirakka
 Categories: Meat, Finnish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      3 oz Butter
      1 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Sugar
      3 c  Wheat flour
      1 oz Yeast cake
           -(or 1 package
           -of dried yeast)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 lg Yellow onion
      1 lb Meat, ground
           -(mixed beef and pork)
      1 c  Cream
  1 1/4 c  Rice, cooked
           -(left-over rice is fine)
      1    Egg
           Salt and pepper
 
  MAKE THE DOUGH:  melt the butter and add milk.  Heat the mixture to 100
  degrees F.  Crumble the yeast into a bowl.  Add the butter-and-milk mixture
  and whip it until the yeast as dissolved. Add sugar, salt and flour and
  stir until it becomes a dough. Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place
  for about 40 minutes.
  
  While the dough rises, chop the onion into very small pieces and put in a
  large frying pan.  Add the ground meat immediately and saute for 10
  minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cooked rice and saute this mixture
  another 5 minutes. Add the cream, season to taste with salt and pepper, and
  turn off the heat. Let the frying pan stand on the stove, covered, until
  the dough is ready. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
  
  Roll out the dough so it fits in a 12x16 inch baking dish.  Put the dough
  into the dish so that the dough covers the whole dish (this is the most
  difficult part; don't be discouraged if you have to roll out the dough
  again).
  
  Add the filling on top of the dough.  Whip the egg and spread it over the
  filling.  Bake it on the bottom rack in the oven for about 20 minutes.
  
  When the pie has cooled off a bit; cut it into pieces that are about 1 1/4
  inches by 6 inches (the traditional size of lihapiirakka in Finland).
  Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Finnish meat pie -- This is an excellent-tasting stomach filler. My dear
  mother gave me this recipe when I moved away from home. She probably
  thought that it would give me that feeling of home. It does. I have tried
  it on my friends and it is always a hit. My mother is from Finland. Yield:
  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  While eating lihapiirakka, you can try the hard work of pronouncing its
  name.  Liha means meat and piirakka is just piirakka. The filling can of
  course be varied.  Other traditional Finnish fillings for other piirakkas
  are blueberries (with some potato flour on top) and cottage cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the crust ingredients carefully.

      Title: Lithuanian Koseliena Saltiena (Jellied Pig's Feet)
 Categories: European, Pork, Meat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Pigs feet (cut in half,
           Lengthwise)
           Water
      1 tb Salt
     18    Black peppercorns
      2    Ribs of celery, including
           Leaves, cut into large
           Chunks
      1 md Yellow onion, peeled
      1    Carrot, scrubbed and cut
           Into about 4 pieces
 
  Singe the feet by holding over a gas flame. Then was, place in a stock pot
  and bring to a boil. Boil for about three minutes. Then pour off the water.
  Add fresh water, salt, and 9 to 12 peppercorns, celery, onion and carrots
  and return to boil. Simmer slowly for about two hours, until meat starts to
  become tender. Remove from heat. Discard vegetables and pepper corns. Allow
  to cool until fat congeals at top. Skim off fat layer. Add Take out meat
  and vegetables and allow cooling liquid to cool so you can skim fat.
  
  Add six fresh black pepper corns and return to boiling. Reduce heat and
  simmer for another two to three hours, until bones are falling apart. Let
  cool and skim fat. Then pour into soup dishes -- about 1 1/2 inches deep,
  making sure feet are covered with liquid -- and refrigerate overnight
  covered with plastic wrap or foil.
  
  (If you choose you may separate meat and bones once the pigs feet are cool
  enough to handle, then pour meat and liquid into bowls and refrigerate.
  Deboning, however, is not necessary -- and not really traditional.) Serve
  with fresh baked rye bread, and whipped unsalted butter (for those who want
  it.)

      Title: Love in Disguise
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Pigs' hearts
      1 sm Onion
      4 oz Fresh breadcrumbs
           Bay leaves
           Parsley
      2    Lemons (zest only)
      1    Egg; beaten with milk
      2 tb Milk; to beat with egg
      2 ts Wine vinegar
           French mustard
     15 oz Canned tomatoes
           A little stock
      2 oz Butter
      1 oz Well-seasoned flour
           Few spoonfuls yoghurt (opt.)
 
  You may get 2 or 3 large hearts for this weight or several smaller ones.
  Whatever the size, they will be slashed; this is normal.  Wash the hearts
  and trim away waste - fat, membrane, gristle and arteries. Soak in lightly
  salted water for 10 minutes then rinse, drain and dry well. Chop the onion
  finely and soften it in 1 oz butter.  Away from the heat stir in the
  breadcrumbs, lemon zest, 4 tablespoons parsley and lots of salt and pepper.
  Bind with the egg and milk.  Use the mixture to stuff the heart cavities,
  and secure the openings with toothpicks or cocktail sticks - there is no
  need to make perfect closures.
  
  Whizz the tomatoes in a blender, stir in the vinegar and add enough stock
  to make up to 1 pint.  Dust the hearts thoroughly with the well-seasoned
  flour.  Melt 1 oz butter in a flameproof casserole, stir in the leftover
  flour and let it brown a little.  Blend in the tomato mixture and make a
  smooth, bubbling hot sauce.  Lay the prepared hearts in the sauce and tuck
  the bay leaves among them. Cover with greaseproof paper and the lid, and
  cook at 325 F (160 C) gas mark 3 for 1 hour. Turn the hearts gently and
  continue cooking for 1 to 1-1/2 hours more until meat is beautifully
  tender.
  
  Transfer the hearts to a warmed serving dish.  Stir the mustard into the
  sauce, add salt and pepper to taste - and carefully blend in the yoghurt if
  liked.  Pour the sauce over the hearts, scatter lavishly with chopped
  parsley and serve with boiled potatoes or noodles.

---------------------------SPIRIT OF THE HARVEST---------------------------
    1/2 c  Salt, coarse
      1 c  Sugar, maple
      1 ts Peppercorns
 
  Brown sugar can be substituted for maple sugar.
  
  Coarsely grind peppercorns.  Mix all ingredients.
  
  Pat meat or fish dry and rub inside and out with seasoning mixture. Place
  in cool, dry place for about 1 hr.  Place wood chips in water to soak.
  Smoke until done.
  
  If you do not have a smoker or wish to build the traditional Indian one
  described here, improvise by building a charcoal fire with all vents open.
  While fire is burning down, loop a piece of kitchen string under gills of
  each trout.  Bring ends of string through vent holes of grill cover and tie
  so that fish are suspended from lid and tails remain at least 6" above
  coals.  When coals have burned down and are covered with white ash,
  sprinkle 1/3 of damp wood chips over fire and place on grill. Smoke trout
  for about 1 hour, adding more damp wood chips every 15-20 minutes to keep
  up smoke.  Remove fish and serve hot or at room temp. Refrigerated, smoked
  fish will last about 1 week.

      Title: Margo's Lamb Stew
 Categories: Meat, Soup
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 lg Onion (thinly sliced)
      4    Garlic cloves, minced
      3 lb Lamb cut into
           -stew-sized cubes and
           -carefully trimmed of fat
      4 lb Tomatoes, cooked
           -(2 large cans)
      3    Bay leaves
           Lemon juice
      1 tb Hungarian paprika
      1 ts Celery salt
    1/2 ts Cumin, ground
    1/8 ts Cayenne
      1 ds Allspice
      1 ds Cinnamon, ground
  1 1/2 lb Green beans, fresh,
           -washed and trimmed
 
  In a steeped, saute onion in olive oil on medium-low heat until golden
  brown. Add garlic in the last 2-3 minutes. Add lamb cubes and saute until
  brown. Add tomatoes and simmer until meat is tender. Keep an eye on the
  liquid; add water or red wine if it becomes dry.
  
  Add bay leaves, lemon juice and spices.  Simmer on low heat for at least 2
  hours.  About 1/2 hour before pronouncing it done, add the green beans.
  Serve with plain yogurt and pita bread.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fragrant lamb stew -- This recipe comes from Margo Kaiser, with whom I
  used to work. It's a delicious stew, spiced fragrantly but not hot. It's
  one of my favorites. It's also very easy. The most tedious work is trimming
  the lamb, and you can get the butcher to take care of that.
  
  The spice mixture is my attempt to re-create Margo's "secret spice" (she
  didn't offer that recipe).  Feel free to try your own variations. If you
  hit on one that you feel is particularly good, please let me know about it.
  Yield:  serves 6 to 8.
  
  *  I prefer to cook to the point of simmering, refrigerate overnight, and
  then finish cooking the next evening. This greatly enhances the flavor.
  When you take the stew from the refrigerator, skim any lamb fat that has
  congealed on the top before continuing.
  
  *  I find that many butchers don't understand that I want good quality meat
  in stews. I get better quality, more carefully trimmed meat by telling them
  that I want lamb cubes cut for shish kebab.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

      Title: Marinated Lamb
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Red wine
    1/2 c  Soy sauce (up
           -to 3/4 C)
      1 tb Rosemary leaves,
           -crushed
      1 tb Black pepper, fresh
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed
      1    Half leg of lamb,
           -butterflied
 
  Mix together all of the ingredients except the lamb.  Place the lamb in a
  bowl or pan that will not be corroded by the marinade (a glass 9x13 pan
  works well).
  
  Pour most of the marinade over the lamb.  Swish the lamb around and get it
  soaked on both sides.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least
  several hours, turning occasionally.
  
  Start a fire in the grill and get the coals very warm but not flaming.
  Place lamb on grill about 3-4 inches from the coals. Cook on this side for
  20 minutes, basting with the extra marinade occasionally. Turn the meat
  over and cook another 20 minutes.
  
  After 10 minutes on the second side, start checking for doneness. Contrary
  to many people's ideas, lamb should not be well done but should still be a
  little pink. When done, slice thin and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- This is the best recipe I have ever
  had for lamb. It really brings out the flavor wonderfully. It came
  originally from the "Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook."
  
  A wonderful side dish for this is the Spanish recipe for Garlic fried
  potatoes.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  For the meat, you need a half leg of lamb which has been butterflied. A
  good butcher can do this for you but don't be afraid of trying it yourself.
  To butterfly the leg, take a sharp knife and start at the side and work
  towards the bone.  Once you have found the bone, work along it so you have
  one side completely slit and then cut out the bone. Depending on which end
  of the leg you have, you may need to puzzle over some of the weirdnesses of
  the bone shape. Don't discard the bone, it makes interesting soup.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 40 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: Meatballs in Tomato Sauce
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
-----------------------------SAUCE INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
     13 oz Tomatoes, canned
           -(1 large can), coarsely
           -chopped, with juice
      4 oz Tomato sauce (1 small can)
      1    Garlic clove, minced
    1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
      1 ts Chili powder

----------------------------MEATBALL INGREDIENTS----------------------------
      1 lb Pork sausage
    1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
    1/2 c  Cracker crumbs
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese (grated)
      1    Egg
      1 lb Pasta (tagliarini,
           -spaghetti or whatever)
 
  Combine the sauce ingredients and bring to a boil while preparing the
  meatballs.  Mix all meatball ingredients.  It is easiest to do this with
  your hands. Form into walnut-sized balls.
  
  Drop the meatballs into BOILING sauce.  If the sauce is not boiling, the
  meatballs will fall to pieces.  Simmer gently for about an hour. If you are
  making the sauce to eat right away, you will probably want to skim the
  grease that cooks out of the sausage periodically. If you are making this
  ahead, the grease will congeal when it sits overnight in the refrigerator,
  and you can remove it easily then.
  
  Check for salt.  Depending on the brands of sausage and tomatoes you use,
  you may not need any. If you need to add salt, be sparing.
  
  Boil the pasta.  Pour the sauce and meatballs over it and serve with grated
  parmesan, or combine and reheat in a casserole, sprinkled with parmesan.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple meatballs in herb and garlic tomato sauce -- I've been making
  this recipe since I was about 10 years old, and I don't remember where we
  got it. It's easy and very good, though. Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  This is fine made a day ahead.  Chilling it gives you a chance to remove
  the grease that cooks out of the sausage.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      2 lb Boneless beef round steak
      1 tb Salt
      2 ts Dried thyme, crushed
      2 ts Ground coriander
      1 ts Pepper
    1/2 c  Cooking oil
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Finely chopped onion
      4 ea Cloves garlic, minced
      8 oz Plain yogurt
    1/2 c  Chopped cucumber
      1 ea Clove garlic, minced
     20 ea Pita bread rounds, halved
      2 ea Medium tomatoes, chopped
      1 c  Snipped fresh parsley
 
  o  Have your butcher bone & butterfly the leg of lamb.  Place lamb, cut
  side up, and beef side by side on a work surface; cover with clear plastic
  wrap.  Using the smooth side of a meat mallet, pound each piece of meat to
  a 16 X 12 inch rectangle, 1/2 to 1/4 inch thick. Cut and patch meats where
  necessary to make the surface even.
  
  o  Combine salt, thyme, coriander, and pepper; sprinkle over meat. Pound in
  seasonings.  Place beef atop lamb, fitting meat to edges. Pound together.
  Fold meat; place in a plastic bag set in a shallow dish.
  
  o  For marinade, in a small bowl combine oil, lemon juice, onion, and 4
  cloves garlic; pour over meat and seal bag; marinate in the refrigerator
  for 6 to 24 hours, turning occasionally.
  
  o  Remove meat from marinade, reserving marinade.  Unfold meat and roll up,
  jelly-roll style, beginning at narrow end.  Tie meat securely with string,
  first at center, then half-way between center and each end. Tie lengthwise.
  Finish securing the roll by tying once more between each crosswise string
  and 1" from each end.
  
  o  Insert spit rod; center the meat on the spit and test balance. Fasten
  with holding forks.  Arrange hot coals around a drip pan; test for MEDIUM
  HOT heat where the meat will be.  Attach spit, turn on the motor, and lower
  the grill hood.  Let the meat rotate over the drip pan for 1 to 2 hours or
  till rare to medium rare (140 to 150 degrees), brushing with the reserved
  marinade occasionally.
  
  o  Remove meat from the spit.  For sauce, combine yogurt, cucumber, and 1
  clove garlic.  Thinly slice meat crosswise, removing strings as you slice.
  Serve meat with Pita bread.  Top with yogurt mixture, chopped tomato, and

  eggs, stirring so pieces seperate.  Once eggs form themselves into curds,
  drain, reserving oil.  Return reserved oil to wok and lightly brown garlic.
  Add all vegetables, stir frying until just cooked, about 3-4 min. Return

      Title: Mushu Pork
 Categories: Meat, Chinese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 tb Chinese rice wine
           -or dry sherry
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 lb Boneless pork butt
           -or shoulder, shredded
    1/2 c  Shredded lily stems
    1/4 c  Tree ears; soaked,
           - squeezed dry and shredded
      4    Scallions; shredded
    1/4 c  Shredded bamboo shoots
      5 tb Peanut oil
      4    Eggs; lightly beaten
      3 tb Chicken broth
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 tb Chinese rice wine
           -or dry sherry
      1 ts Light soy sauce
      2 ts Sesame oil
           Salt to taste
 
  MARINATE THE SHREDDED PORK for 20 to 30 minutes. Prepare all the other
  shredded ingredients--tree ears, lily stems, scallions and bamboo shoots.
  Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wok over a moderate flame and pour in
  the beaten eggs. As soon as the egg begins to cling to the wok, scoop it
  and fold it over to scramble it. Work fast because the egg solidifies
  quickly and it can overcook. As soon as it solidifies, remove it from the
  wok and set it aside. Stir-fry the pork over high heat in 1 tablespoon of
  the oil for 30 seconds, or until it no longer looks raw. Remove it from the
  wok and set it aside. In the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil, stir-fry
  the vegetables, more to combine them and heat them through than to cook
  them. Add the pork and mix it well with the seasonings. Finally, add the
  eggs, breaking them up to form bite-size lumps. Combine the ingredients
  well. Serve alone or with a platter of heated pancakes and a small bowl of
  hoisin sauce. Serves 2 to 4 as a main course.

      Title: Mustard Pork Chop in Foil
 Categories: Meat, Diabetic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    1/4 ts Vegetable or olive oil
      1    Thick slice onion
      5 oz Boneless pork chop
      1 ts Prepared mustard
           Salt and pepper to taste
           Sprig of rosemary or
    1/4 ts Dried rosemary, optional
 
  Hands on time: 5 minutes. Baking time: 20 to 30 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Tear heavy-duty foil to make a 12-inch square; smear foil with oil. Place
  onion slice on half of foil. Trim fat from chop, spread both sides with
  mustard, place on onion, sprinkle with salt and pepper, top with rosemary
  if desired. Close foil to form triangle, roll edges and crimp firmly to
  seal, turning sealed edges upward. (A surprising amount of juices are
  generated during cooking.) Place in baking pan (lest those juices leak) and
  bake 20 to 30 minutes, depending on thickness of chop, or until chop is no
  longer pink in center.
  
  Transfer packet to dinner plate, open and turn chop with onion and juices
  onto plate. Serve, if desired, with potato or sweet potato baked in same
  oven.

      Yield: 999 Servings
 
      4 pk Hot Dogs (meat/beef)
      1 cn Beer
      1 pk KC Masterpeice BBQ sauce
 
  Chicken hot dogs won't work, beef works best but "meat" one are ok. Cut hot
  dogs into 1" pieces and put in crock pot.  Cover with beer, I use the cheap
  stuff. cover and cook for several hours, until the dogs plump up. drain off
  beer and cover with BBQ sauce.  Cook a couple of more hours. This is much
  better than it sounds.  Kids will generally hate it, but adults will inhale
  it. I know...it's *hot dogs*, but this is different.

      Title: Neat's Tongue (To Serve Hot or Cold)
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Pickled ox tongue (4-5 lbs.)
      2    Onions
      2    Carrots
      2    Celery stalks
           Bay leaves
           Parsley
           Rosemary
     12    Black peppercorns

------------------------ALSO, IF SERVING TONGUE COLD------------------------
           A little Madeira
           Gelatine powder
 
  Rinse the tongue and then soak it in plenty of cold water for at least 12
  hours.  Change the water once or more during this time. Next day choose a
  heavy-based saucepan or flameproof casserole that will hold the tongue
  snugly.  Put the tongue into it, cover with cold water, bring to the boil
  and skim.  Taste the water; if it is very salty, tip it away, add fresh
  water and bring to the boil again.  Add the chopped vegetables, peppercorns
  and a bouquet of bay, parsley and rosemary. Cover tightly and cook very
  gently on top of the stove or in an oven heated to 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2
  for about 4 hours until the tongue is so tender that a skewer will go
  through the root end like butter. Lower the temperature as necessary; the
  meat will be best if barely a bubble breaks the surface of the liquid as it
  cooks. Skin the cooked tongue while it is still hot. Then cut away the fat
  and gristle from the end and remove all small bones if the butcher has not
  already done this.  Skim off all the fat from the cooking liquor and save
  it for the sauce and for soups.
  
  IF THE TONGUE IS TO BE SERVED HOT, carve it in thin slices while it is
  still hot and arrange it prettily, overlapping slices like tiles, on a
  large warmed serving dish.  Pour some good hot sauce over it, cover the
  dish with foil and place in the oven for about 10 minutes to heat through.
  The spiced Kumquat Sauce recipe is one of my favourites and I like to serve
  extra in a sauce boat.
  
  IF THE TONGUE IS TO BE SERVED COLD, mould and glaze it while still warm.
  Curl the tongue to make it fit a small round container with straight sides.
  Traditional tongue-presses usually measure about 5-6 inches in diameter; a
  cake tin or souffle dish of similar size will do just as well.
  
  To glaze, melt 2 teaspoons gelatine powder in 1 tablespoon water, then
  blend in a scant 1/2 pint tongue cooking liquor (seasoned and reduced as
  necessary for good flavour), and give it a little oomph with 1-2
  tablespoons Madeira.  Pour over the tongue as much of the liquid jelly as
  is needed to fill gaps.  Press the tongue down with a saucer or plate which
  fits just inside the tin, weight it down heavily and leave overnight in a
  cold larder until meat and jelly are set.  Chill any left-over jelly
  separately so that it can be diced and used to garnish the tongue when it
  is served.
  
  Unmould the tongue on to a flat dish for serving.  Decorate it and
  accompany it with a fine sauce such as a classic Cumberland sauce or
  Piquant Parsley and Caper Sauce.

      Title: Nue Gra Pao: Stir-Fried Beef with Mint
 Categories: Oriental, Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Flank steak
     14    Serrano chilies
           - finely chopped
    1/4 c  Finely chopped garlic
    1/2 c  Finely chopped yellow onion
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil; PLUS:
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3 tb Fish sauce
      1 tb Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Water (more if needed)
    1/2 c  Mint or basil leaves
           - (loosely packed)
           Green lettuce leaves
 
  This is a rich, hearty dish with plenty of typical Thai flavors.  Any kind
  of beef may be used, but flank steak works particularly well because it is
  easy to cut it across the grain, which helps keep the meat from falling
  apart during stir-frying and produces a tender result. Be sure to serve
  plenty of rice, because it helps moderate the hot chilies without
  detracting from the flavor.  You may reduce the number of chilies by up to
  one half, but traditionally this dish should have a rich, hot chili flavor.
  
  ======================================================================
  
  1.  Slice the beef across the grain into strips 1/4 inch thick and 2 to
        3    inches long.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Pound or grind the chilies, garlic, and onion to a coarse paste in a
  mortar or blender.  If you use a blender you may need to add the oil to aid
  in grinding.
  
  3.  Heat a wok, add the oil, and swirl it over the surface of the pan. (Do
  not add more oil if you have ground the chilies, onion, and garlic in oil.)
  Add the paste from Step 2 and stir-fry until it is light golden.
  
  4.  Add the beef and stir-fry until it is a uniform tan color, but do not
  overcook it.
  
  5.  Add the fish sauce, sugar, water, and mint (or basil) leaves. More
  water may be added if the sauce is too dry.  There should be about 1/2 to
  3/4 cup sauce, depending on how much water you added.
  
  Ahead of time note: The dish may be prepared a day in advance to this
  point.  To do so, proceed through Step 5, omitting the mint or basil
  leaves.  When you are ready to serve, heat the mixture and add the leaves.
  If the meat has absorbed the liquid, add just enough warm water to bring it
  back to the original consistency.
  
  6.  Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves in a serving bowl and put the
  beef mixture over them.  Serve the beef immediately or keep it warm while
  preparing other dishes.
  
  7.  Serve with rice.
  
  (Serves 4 to 6)

  5.  Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves on a serving platter, and
  place th beef mixture on top.  Garnish with sprigs of coriander and mint or
  basil leaves.
  
  6.  Serve at room temperature, the vinegar sauce (from Step 1) and rice.
  
  *  Use small hot chilies about 3 to 4 inches long.  Roast whole chillie
  stems and all, in a dry wok or skillet until the color changes to dark red
  or brown depending on the chilies used.  Be careful not to let them burn.
  When the chilies have cooled, remove the stems and seeds. Place the chilies
  in a food processor or blender and grind using short pulses. Pre-ground
  chilies are also commercially available, but often lack the "bite" of home
  ground ones and may be more expensive.
  
  ** Place uncooked rice in a dry wok or skillet and heat over moderate heat
  until deep golden brown,s tirring frequently to keep from burning and to
  allow it to develop a uniform color.  Watch the rice carefully after it
  begins to change colorand stir constantly because it can burn easily at
  this stage.  When it is auniform deep golden color, remove from heat and
  allow to cool to room temperature.  Grind it to a fine powder in a blender
  or a spice grinder.  This can be made in advance and kept in quantity so
  that there is always a supply on hand, but it is also easy to make up while
  preparing the dish.

      Title: Paneed Veal and Fettucini
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 qt Hot water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 tb Salt
    3/4 lb Fresh fettucini (1/2 lb dry)
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter
  2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    3/4 c  + 4 tsp. Parmesan cheese
  1 3/4 c  Very fine dry bread crumbs
  1 1/2 tb Minced fresh parsley
  1 1/2 tb Olive oil
    3/4 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Onion powder
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
      3 ea Eggs
      6 ea 4 oz slices white veal (note
      1 x  Vegetable oil for pan frying
 
  NOTE:  You will need 6, 3-1/2 to 4 ounce slices of baby white veal, pounded
  thin for this recipe.
     Place the water, the 2 tablespoons oil and the salt in a large pot over
  high heat; cover and bring to a boil. when water readdds a rolling boil,
  add small amounts of fettucini at a time to the pot, breaking up oil
  patches as you drop it in.  Return to boiling and cook oncovered to al
  dente stage (about 3 minutes if fresh pasta, 7 minutes if dry); do not
  overcook.
   during this cooking time, use a wooden or spagheti spoon to left fettucini
  out of the water by spoonfruls and shake strands back into the water. (It
  may be an old wives' tale, but this procedure seems to enhance the pasta's
  texture.)  Then immediately drain in a colander and stop its cooking by
  running cold water over strands (if you used dry pasta, first rinse with
  hot water to wash off starch); after it has cooled thoroughly, about 2 to 3
  minutes, pour a liberal amount of vegetable oil in your hands and toss
  fettucini.  set aside still in the colander. Melt the butter in a large
  skillet over medium-low heat; add the cream and cayenne pepper. Turn the
  heat to medium-high. with a metal whisk whip the cream nmixture constantly
  as it comes to a boil. the reduce heat and simmer until the sauce has
  reduced some and thickened enough to coat a spoon well, about 7 to 8
  minutes, whisking constantly. Remove from heat and gradually add 3/4 cup of
  the parmesan, whisking until cheese is melted. Set aside.
     Heat 6 large serving plates in a 250F oven. In a shallow pan (cake and
  pie pans work well) combine the bread crumbs, parsley, olive oil, white
  pepper, onion and garlic;, mix well. In a separate pan beat the eggs well,
  then beat in the remaining 4 teaspoons Parmesan. Soak the veal in the egg
  mixture for at least 5 minutes, being sure to coat it thoroughly.
   Meanwhile, heat 1/4 inch oil to about 400F in a large skillett. Then, just
  before frying, dredge veal in the bread crumbs, coating well and pressing
  the crumbs in with your hands; shake off any excess. Fry the veal in the
  hot oil until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Do not crowd. (Change
  the oil mid-way through frying if the crumbs in the bottom start to burn.)
  Remove veal to a large platter and set aside.
      Reheat the cheese sauce over medium-high heat, whisking frequently.
  (NOTE:  If butter starts separating from the sauce, whisk in about 1
  tablespoon cream or water.)  Add the fettucini and loss until tho9roughly
  coated and heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and serve
  immediately.    To serve, place a piece of veal on each heated serving
  plate.  roll each portion of fettucini onto a large fork and lift onto the
  plate; Top the fettucini with additional sauce from the skillet. From Paul

      Title: Pasta with Pork & Basil
 Categories: Meat, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 oz Fusilli or other fresh pasta
      6 oz Mushrooms
           Fresh basil, parsley, chives

-----------------------------FOR THE MEATBALLS-----------------------------
      1 lb Lean freshly minced pork
           Parmesan cheese
           Fresh basil
           Garlic
    1/2 sm Egg; lightly beaten
           A little butter or oil

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
    1/2 oz Butter
  1 1/2 tb Plain flour
    1/4 pt Double cream
    1/2 pt (scant) stock
           Parmesan cheese
           Dijon mustard
 
  Mix all the meatball ingredients thoroughly; I season the meat with 1
  tablespoon grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons basil and 1 smallish garlic
  clove, as well as salt and pepper.  Flour your hands and shape the mixture
  into about 32 small balls.  Fry in batches in a non-stick pan for 5 minutes
  or more until golden and cooked right through.  Shake the pan frequently so
  the meatballs keep in good shape and cook evenly. Transfer to a casserole
  and keep hot.
  
      Slice the mushrooms thickly, saute' them well and add them to the
  meatballs.  Then "wash out" the frying pan with the chicken stock. Make a
  smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock and cream. Add any juices
  that have collected in the casserole and simmer for several minutes. Away
  from the heat, season with salt and pepper, 2 tablespoons Parmesan and 1
  heaped teaspoon Dijon mustard.  Pour the sauce over the meatballs, cover
  and keep hot in a low oven.  The mixture can be kept hot for some time
  without spoiling, or it can be prepared ahead and reheated close to
  serving.
  
      Boil the pasta until al dente and drain well.  Add it to the casserole
  together with a small handful of fresh herbs -- about 2 tablespoons each
  basil and chives, and 1 of parsley -- and toss gently to mix well. Garnish
  with more basil, and serve with an undressed salad.

  In a small skillet, heat the butter and saute the almonds until they are
  golden brown.
  
  Mound the beef onto a serving platter and sprinkle with the almonds.
  Surround it with a border of rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Latin-American seasoned chopped beef -- I got this recipe from net.cooks
  in the fall of 1983. It was posted by houxm!houxz!llf.
  
  *  Picadillo is a great favorite throughout Latin America, and every
  country has its own version. In Mexico it is much appreciated as a filling
  for tacos, empanadas, tamales and green peppers. In the north of the
  country it is popular on its own and is eaten as a main dish, accompanied
  by rice, beans, guacamole and tortillas.
  
  *  Variations:  Instead of oregano and thyme, use a pinch or two of
  cinnamon and ground cloves. This makes an interesting difference in flavor,
  giving the dish an almost Middle Eastern taste.
  
  *  In Chihuahua, the apple is left out and 4 medium potatoes, cooked and
  cubed, and about 2 C cooked green peas are added to the beef at the end of
  the cooking time for just long enough to heat them through. This makes a
  nice one-dish meal.
  
  *  Picadillo de la Costa from the state of Guerrero, best known for the
  beach resort of Acapulco, uses the tropical fruits in which the region
  abounds, and instead of beef uses an equal mixture of ground pork and veal.
  The method is the same but the meats, with the onion, garlic, tomatoes, hot
  peppers, salt and pepper, are cooked, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Then add
  about 1 1/2 C pineapple chunks, 2 pears (peeled, cored and cut in chunks)
  and 2 bananas (peeled and sliced) are added and the mixture simmered for 15
  minutes longer over low heat. Sprinkle with almonds just before serving.
  This is a delicious summer dish, good with plain rice.
  
  *  In addition to the almonds, I add fresh coriander leaves as a garnish.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: Pigeon, Hare & Ham Terrine
 Categories: Game, Pork, Ethnic, Uk, Meat
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      1    Hare
      2    Pigeon breasts
    2/3 c  Dry white wine
    1/4 c  Cognac
      4    Juniper berries
      2    Shallots
           Oil for frying
      4 oz Pork fat
      1 ts Dried thyme
      1    Egg
           Fine sea salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 lb Tissue-thin slices of
           -pork fat or unsmoked
           -streaky (fatty) bacon
      8 oz Good quality cooked ham,
           -in 1 inch cubes
           Aspic powder or
           -powdered (unflavoured)
           -gelatine, to thicken
           Garnish:
           Gherkins
           Bay leaf
 
  Remove all the meat from the hare and place it together with the skinned,
  boned and lightly beaten pigeon breasts in a bowl. Add the wine, and Cognac
  and crushed juniper berries and leave to marinate in a cool place overnight
  or for 48 hours if possible. Turn the meat frequently.
  
  Drain the meat and pat dry. Strain the marinade and reserve the liquid.
  Preheat the oven to 375 F. Slice the shallots and saute them lightly in
  oil. Reserve 5-6 large pieces of hare, and the pigeon breasts and cut into
  strips. Mince (grind) the rest of the hare meat, the shallots and pork fat.
  Add the thyme, marinade, beaten egg and salt and pepper to taste, and mix
  well.
  
  Line a terrine dish with the thin pork fat or bacon. Stretching the fat
  thin can be done easily by holding it down on a board, and running the back
  of a carving knife across it. Spread the minced (ground) mixture on the
  bottom of the terrine, then place strips of marinated hare, pigeon and ham
  on top. Continue adding layers of the minced (ground) mixture and hare,
  pigeon and cubes of ham. Make sure that the last layer is the minced
  (ground) mixture. Cover with a layer of fat and the lid.
  
  Cook in a bain marie (a roasting pan with 5 cm/2 inches of water will work
  just as well) for 1 1/4-1 1/2 hours. When cooked, the terrine will have
  shrunk from the sides of the dish. Pierce the terrine with a skewer: if
  there is no trace of blood and the juices run clear the terrine is done.
  Remove the lid, place a weight on top and cool, preferably overnight,
  before serving. Sometimes we pour off the juices, thicken them with a
  little aspic powder or gelatine and pour them back over the terrine before
  cooling. The flavour of the terrine improves if kept for 3-4 days before
  serving. Before serving, remove the top layer of fat and decorate with
  gherkins and a bay leaf.

           -diameter) hog casings
      3 lb Lean pork butt, cubed
      1 lb Lean beef chuck, cubed
    1/2 lb Veal, cubed
    1/2 lb Pork fat, cubed
  2 1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
      3 ts Finely ground black pepper

      2 ts Ground summer savory
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
      3    Cloves garlic, finely
           -minced
      2 tb Sweet paprika
 
  "Recipes for this sausage are so variable that what passes for kielbasa in
  one area might be regarded as not authentic in another. The ingredients and
  pronunciation of kielbasa are as variable as are the vagaries of the spring
  weather, the time of year when kielbasa is traditionally made. This version
  uses pork, beef, and veal and makes five pounds."
  
  1. Prepare the casings.
  
  2. Grind the meats and fat together through the coarse disk.
  
  3. Mix the remaining ingredients with the meat.
  
  4. Stuff the casings and leave the sausage in long links. Lengths of
  eighteen inches to two feet are traditional.
  
  5. Allow the sausage to dry in a cool place for three or four hours or
  refrigerate for twenty-four hours uncovered.
  
  6. Cook by roasting in a 425~ F. oven for forty-five minutes. These
  sausages are also excellent grilled over a charcoal fire and eaten in a
  Kaiser roll, lathered with a spicy brown mustard.

      Title: Pork Chops Italiano
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Pork loin chops
 10 1/2 oz Tomato soup, condensed
           -(1 small can)
      1    Green pepper, sliced
      1    Onion, diced
      1    Bay leaf
           Oil for frying
           Salt and pepper
 
  Heat the oil in a saucepan or frying pan (choose one with a lid). Season
  both sides of the chops with salt and pepper to taste. Brown the chops
  quickly on both sides. Remove from the pan.
  
  Fry the onions until soft, but not brown.  You may need to add a little
  more fat, but I prefer to use as little as possible. Return the chops to
  the pan, add the tomato soup, green pepper and bay leaf. Bring to the boil,
  then simmer gently for 30-40 minutes, or until the chops are cooked.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pork chops simmered in tomato and onion -- Apologies to anyone of
  Italian descent, I'm sure this dish will seem a slander on your culinary
  heritage, but that's the way I learned this recipe.
  
  As much as I like grilled pork chops, I enjoy a change.   This recipe isn't
  haute cuisine, but I think it is particularly good when you get home from
  work on a cold, wet evening. The preparation is fairly quick, and it leaves
  you time to warm up in front of the fire with a cup of tea and read a
  newspaper.
  
  *  I serve this with rice.  If you like brown rice, it has the advantage of
  taking as long to cook as the rest of the meal, so you get an uninterrupted
  half-hour.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      Title: Pork Chops with Crust of Onions
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 ea Large center-cut Pork Chops
      1 x  Salt
      1 x  Freshly Ground White Pepper
  5 1/2 tb Butter
      2 ts Chopped Fresh Tarragon
      4 c  Chopped Onions

    2/3 c  Dry White Wine
    2/3 c  Chicken Stock
    2/3 c  Fresh homemade Bread Crumbs
    2/3 c  Freshly Grated Parmesan
 
  * You can use 1 teaspoon of dried tarragon instead of 2 teaspoons of fresh
  tarragon. The pork chops should have the bone in and weigh about 10 oz
  each. ** Your doctor will have a sh*t-fit if he/she knows about the butter.
  Sprinkle chops with salt and pepper. Melt 2 1/2 tablespoons of butter in a
  large heavy frying pan over medium-high heat and brown chops on both sides,
  turning frequently so they do not stick. Remove from pan, sprinkle with
  tarragon, cover and keep warm. Add another tablespoon of butter to the pan
  drippings and saute onions for 3 minutes or until soft and golden. Spread
  2/3 of the onions in the bottom of a shallow casserole, arrange chops,
  tarragon-side down on top. Sprinkle lightly with thyme and cover with
  onions. Pour wine into pan, bring to a boil, add chicken stock, return to
  the boil and cook until liquid is reduced to about 2/3 of a cup. Pour
  mixture over chops. Combine bread crumbs and cheese, spread over onions and
  chops. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter and drizzle it over the crumbs.

      Title: Pork Loin Braised in Milk
 Categories: Meat, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Pork loin roast
           -(between 2-5 lb; you
           -can also use a pork
           -shoulder roast)
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Olive oil
           Salt
           Black pepper,
           -freshly ground
           Milk to cover roast;
           -see instructions
      2 tb Water, warm
           -(more as needed)
 
  Find a saucepan that fits the pork roast closely, but still allows you to
  turn the roast in it.  Add the butter and oil to the pan. Heat at
  medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides.
  
  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add enough milk to cover 3/4 of the meat.
  Cover the saucepan, but leave the lid ajar.  Turn the heat down to medium
  and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, until the sauce has reduced to thick,
  nut-brown clusters. If the sauce has not reduced after 2 1/2 hours, remove
  the meat, keep it warm, and increase the heat to high until the sauce
  thickens.
  
  Remove the roast from the sauce, if you haven't already.  Turn the heat
  down and skim the fat from the sauce. Add the water, turn the heat to high,
  and scrape the bottom of the saucepan (there will be a crust on the bottom
  that you'll want to get loose).
  
  Return the meat to the pan, warm it up, and serve it with the sauce.
  
  The cleanup for this recipe takes a while, because the saucepan gets a
  crust on the bottom.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Italian-style pork roast in milk -- I got this recipe from a friend, who
  got it from a cookbook in Italy.  It is very rich and flavorful. I have not

      Title: Pork Roast with Spiced Wine
 Categories: Medieval, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
  Cormarye.  Take colyaundre, caraway smale grounden, powdour of peper and
  garlec ygrounde, in rede wyne; medle all thise togyder and salt it. Take
  loynes of pork rawe and fle of the skyn, and pryk it wel with a knyf, and
  lay it in the sawse.  Roost it whan thou wilt, & kepe that that fallith
  therfro in the rostyng and seeth it in a possynet with faire broth, & serue
  it forth with the roost anoon.
  
  1.8 kg/4 lb pork loin joint on the bone 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander 1
  teaspoon caraway seeds, pounded or pulverised in a grinder 1 large clove
  garlic, peeled and crushed with salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black
  pepper 1 teaspoon salt 175 ml/6 fl oz/ 1/4 cup red wine About 225 ml/8 fl
  oz/1 cup chicken stock
  
  The spiced wine was originally used as a marinade or baste dripped over the
  meat while it spit-roasted.  A joint might also be heavily dredged with
  crumbs or flour while it roasted, or might be wrapped in caul like a huge
  sausage to prevent the surface scorching.  I have used foil for wrapping,
  which makes it easy to save the drippings. Ask your butcher to chine the
  joint.
  
  A small coffee or mut mill will reduce the caraway seeds to powder, and do
  it more effectively if you grind the garlic with them.
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas Mark 7.  Strip the skin off the pork
  joint and prick the fat all over with a knife point.  Mix the spices,
  garlic and seasonings into the wine and rub the meat all over with this
  mixture.  Lay the joint on a doubled sheet of foil big enough to enclose
  it.  Fasten the edges of the foil around the meat, leaving an open space at
  the top.  Pour most of the remaining wine mixture over the meat, then close
  the foil parcel.  Cook the joint at 220C/425F/Gas Mark 7 for 10 minutes,
  then reduce the heat to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4; allow 30 minutes per 450 g/1
  lb and 30 minutes over. Open the foil for the last 30 minutes to brown the
  surface of the meat; turn up the heat a little if you wish.
  
  Lift the meat carefully out of the foil parcel and 'rest' it on a warmed
  serving dish while you make a sauce with the spiced wine. Scrape any
  drippings and wine mixture from the foil into a saucepan and stir in the
  chicken stock.  Simmer it for a few moments, then taste. Adjust the
  seasoning if required, strain into a warmed gravy boat and serve with the
  meat.

      Title: Pork Sausage
 Categories: Makemeat, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Pork (80% lean)
  1 1/2 ts Marjoram
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Warm water
  2 1/2 ts Powdered sage
    1/2 ts Savory
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
 
  Cut pork and fat into 1/4 inch cubes, using coarse blade of meat grinder,
  grind meat. Place in Large bowl.  Mix Spices in the 1/4 cup warm water and
  knead the mixture into the meat thoroughly. To make breakfast sausage, add
  sage with a heavy hand for that country kitchen taste. For a spicy sausage,
  add 1/8 tsp. cayanne. Form into patties or rolls shaping the meat, stuff
  into natural casings to make links. If freezing the sausage, do not add
  salt or sage or it will cause an off flavor. Can freeze six months in
  freezer. Contributor writes that she has been making this recipe for many
  years. Her farmer husband wanted a recipe that tasted like the sausage his
  grandmother made.  M. Watkins.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Lean end belly of pork
      2    Pig's kidneys, (5 oz each)
      3 sm Oranges
      1    Head of celery
      1    Onion
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
           Parsley and rosemary
      1    Bay leaf
           A little yeast extract
           Flour and dripping
 
  Halve and core the kidneys.  Soak them in acidulated water for 1 hour then
  drain and dry.  Bone the pork, reserve the rind and cut the flesh (there
  should be at least 1 lb.) into large cubes.  Grate the zest of all 3
  oranges and squeeze the juice from 2.  Measure the juice and add enough
  yeast extract dissolved in hot water to make 8 fl. oz. of liquid in total.
  
  Seal the pork briskly in a little hot fat and transfer to a casserole.
  Slice the kidneys thickly, dust with flour, brown in the hot fat and add to
  the casserole.  Tie together 3 sprigs of rosemary, 6 bruised parsley stalks
  and a bay leaf, and bury the bouquet among the meats. Roughly chop the
  onion and fry it briefly.  Sprinkle on 1-1/2 tablespoons flour and pour on
  the liquid.  Bring to the boil, stirring, and add to the casserole. Add
  plenty of salt and pepper, the crushed garlic and orange zest. Cut the
  celery into large chunks and add it to the casserole - do not stir it in.
  Lay the pork rind, fat side down, on top of the celery, and put a sheet of
  greaseproof paper over that. Cover with the lid and cook at 325 F (160 C)
  gas mark 3 for 1-1/2 hours, then at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for a further
  45 minutes.
  
  Remove and discard the paper, rind and bouquet of herbs.  Stir the
  casserole to mix the ingredients and add the flesh of the reserved orange,
  cut into V-shaped segments and ruthlessly stripped of all membrane. Cover
  with fresh greaseproof paper and the lid; cool quickly and chill overnight.
  
  Remove surface fat and reheat the casserole gently but thoroughly for
  serving.  Check seasoning and garnish with fresh chopped parsley.

  Take the piece of meat and make holes in it with a knife.  Mix together a
  seasoning of salt and pepper, chipped Jamaica pepper, onions, tomatoes,
  thyme, scallion, and put a little in each hole, then roast in an iron pot
  with a few tablespoons of water; turn frequently. This is a most delicious
  way of cooking meat.

  little melted butter (except ham, which has fat enough).
  Pack closely in small stone or earthen jars. Put jars in steamer and heat
  for one half hour. Then press the meat down again and cover with hot melted
  butter. This will keep some time and may be served in slices or used for
  sandwiches. Ham and tongue may be mixed with veal or chicken. Beef, game
  and fish are better alone.

      Title: Poultry Sausages-Information
 Categories: Makemeat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text
 
  When one thinks of sausage, the meat that ordinarily comes to mind is pork,
  sometimes beef, but usually never meat that comes from anything that has
  wings and feathers. There are probably more recipes dealing with what you
  can do with whole poultry or poultry pieces, especially chicken, than with
  any other kind of meat. But sausage? Why not? Poultry is one of the most
  heathful foods around. Ounce for ounce, it is a treasure house of protein
  and minerals and an absolute bargin when one compares the proportion of
  lean to fat meat. Chicken and turkey especially are recommended for people
  on low fat and/or low calorie diets. All poultry has the added advantage of
  being a rather bland meat. This means we can do just about anything to it
  to make it taste as we please. One person who had studied the possibilities
  of what can be done with poultry is Dr. Robert C. Baker of the New York
  State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University. Dr
  Baker is the inventor of the so-called "chicken dog." In an attempt to fine
  new uses for poultry, especially laying hens past their prime, Dr. Baker
  and his colleagues found that one can do just about anything with chicken
  and turkey that one can do with red meat. And poultry has the advantage of
  being cheaper and lower in fat than red meat. Lest anyone doubt that a
  chicken dog can taste like a "real" hot dog, sensory analysis of products
  developed by Dr. Baker and his colleagues has proven that people are just
  as apt to like a product made from chicken or turkey meat, even though it
  it may be a traditionally red meat product. The proliferation ath the
  corner deli of things like "turkey salami", "turkey pastrami", or "chicken
  bologna", are proof that the public is readily willing to accept these
  products made from poultry. Large companies would not invest the capital
  necessary to produce these products if the public did not accept them.
  Although Dr. baker's work extends beyond what the home sausage maker might
  find valuable, it does open up possibilities that anyone with a food
  grinder and a source of poultry will find exciting.
  
  Because everyone's tastes are different, these recipes are meant to be
  guides or starting points for the home sausage maker. Generally speaking, a
  larger proportion of dark meat (or even all dark meat), produces a somewhat
  more pleasing sausage than a predominantly white or all white meat. Dark
  meat has a slightly highefr fat content whick a succesful sausage needs.
  Remember, were talking chicken and turkey here, so the fat content is
  already at bargin basement levels. As we noted earlier, poultry tends to be
  a rather bland meat. Generally speaking, a sausage made from chicken or
  turkey will need a little more spice than would a similar sausage made from
  red meat. When making poultry sausages for the first time, use these
  recipes as a guideline, but don't be afraid to be creative. Like more
  fennel in your Italian sausage? More garlic in your kielbasa? Try it,
  you'll probably like it! One final word: what about skin and added fat?
  Commercial sausages made from chicken and turkey meat do contain the skin
  and fat normally found on a whole bird. The inclusion of these two
  ingredients improve both taste and texture. Generally, I have found that
  the addition of some skin greatly improves the sausage. Since we are
  talking about an essentially lean meat to begin with, the addition of a
  small amount of fat seems an acceptable price to pay for a more palatable
  sausage. But the decision is yours. If you are willing to sacrifice
  something in the way of taste and texture for an even leaner product, go
  right ahead. In the recipes that follow, when a recipe specifies, fo
  rexample, 4 lbs. of chicken meat, it presumes that about fifteen percent of
  that is skin and fat. Experiment with the proportions to suit you and your
  family's individual tastes and needs. After all, isn't that one of the
  reasons you are making your own sausage to begin with?

      Title: Prairie Dog Bat Masterson
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Bat Masterson was one of the early law officers of Dodge City, Kansas and a
  great friend of Wyatt Earp.  Bat was an excellent gunfighter. He was a
  short, stubby man with a friendly homespun appearance that made him look
  like anything but a gunfighter.  In later years he became a New York sports
  writer.  He was not a heavy drinker.  He preferred lemon pop to alcoholic
  drinks and drank large quantities of it. His favorite foods were cold
  tongue sandwiches and wiener sandwiches. Bat created a wiener sandwich
  which became well known throughout the Old West and was justly though of as
  a real delicacy. Everyone called it a Prairie Dog. It is one of the
  greatest wiener recipes ever made and will be remembered long after Bat's
  gun deeds are forgotten. Here is the original recipe:
  
  Take a wiener and slit it open lengthwise.  Take ground sage and rub plenty
  of it into the slit and onto the sides of the slit.  Place the wiener in an
  oven and broil until done.  Take a bun and on one side of it put mustard
  and thinly sliced dill pickles. On the other side sprinkle it well with
  Worcestershire sauce.  The sage, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce blend
  trogether to give you a sanwhich with a wonderful taste. Be sure to try
  this famous sandwhich at your first opportunity. It makes the usual catsup
  and mustard wiener sandwich taste very poor in comparison.

      Title: Rabbit a la Danielle
 Categories: Ethnic, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ea Large domestic rabbit
      1 x  Salt
  1 1/2    Pints of whipping
           Cream
 
                                               1 x  Pepper
  
  Bake in an open casserole at 325F. for two to three hours.  The oval French
  glazed earthenware casserole dishes are the best.  A large New Zealand Red
  rabbit or one that size is the best.  This will fill a large casserole
  dish.  The French remove the eyes, but leave the head attached. Sounds
  gross to American tastes, but the head has some of the tenderest meat on
  the rabbit and surprisingly a large amount. French children (mine as well)
  fight over who gets the head.  Serve with roasted carrots and potatoes.
  Danielle says that since she is not a good cook and hates to cook, this
  dish is easy to prepare and serve. It still has that marvelous French flair
  that is incomparable. Oh yes, serve also with crusty baguettes of French
  bread and a very dry Chardonnay. Come to think of it, a good dry Cabernet
  Sauvignon or Pinot Noir wouldn't be bad either.

      Title: Rack of Lamb Breadbin
 Categories: Lamb
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Rack of lamb, about 5-6 lb
    3/4 c  Fresh garlic cloves, peeled
    1/2 c  Olive oil
           Juice of 4 lemons
      3 tb Dry mustard
      2 tb Bouquet garni
      1 tb Tarragon
 
  Plan ahead if you want to try this lamb dish.  It is best if marinated for
  about four days in the refrigerator.  For extra browning, run it under the
  broiler for a few minutes just before serving.
  
  Have the butcher cut thru the chine bone so meat can be carved into
  individual chops at the table and trim off fat around ends of ribs and
  around kidney area.
  
  Combine garlic and all remaining ingredients in food processor bowl or in
  blender and process until liquefied.  Place roast in large plastic bag,
  add marinade, spreading it all over roast and in between cuts made by
  butcher.  Seal bag and refrigerate at least 2 days.  To roast, remove from
  bag, place in roasting pan and insert meat thermometer in thickest part of
  meat.  Roast at 450 degrees until thermometer registers "medium" for beef.
  The lamb will be medium rare at this point.  If you wish to have it done
  more, follow thermometer accordingly.

      Title: Red Braised Pork Shoulder
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           Pork shoulder (5 to 7 lb),
           -with bone and rind
           Water
    3/4 c  Sherry (dry)
           -or Shaoxing wine
    1/3 c  Dark soy sauce
           Chinese yellow rock sugar,
           -6 crystals (each crystal
           -about 1 inch square)
  1 1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
      6    Star anise cloves
      1    Cinnamon stick
           -(about 2 inches long)
      4 sm Chili peppers,
           -dried (optional)
           Tangerine peel, dried,
           -3 pieces (optional)
      6    Garlic cloves (crushed)
      4 sl Ginger (thick)
      1    Scallion (whole), trimmed
      2    Spinach bunches, washed
 
  Put the pork in a large pot with water to cover.  Bring to a boil, simmer
  for 2 minutes, then drain and rinse. Again add the pork to the pot with
  fresh water to cover, add the wine, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to
  medium, partially cover, and cook for 30 minutes. Add the rest of the
  ingredients (except the spinach), and simmer the pork for another 2 1/2 to
  3 hours. The rind and the fat should be very soft when it's done.
  
  Remove the pork from the liquid and keep it warm.  Strain the sauce into a
  large skillet and reduce it over high heat.  This may take a while,
  depending on how much liquid you end up with.
  
  Meanwhile, steam the spinach until just wilted, salt it lightly, and keep
  it warm. When the sauce is reduced (it should be the consistency of a thin
  syrup), put the pork shoulder in the center of a large platter, arrange the
  spinach around it, and pour the sauce over.

      Title: Red-Cooked Pot Roast (Shanghai Pot Roast)
 Categories: Chinese, Beef, Pork, Meat
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      4 lb Chuck roast, boneless,
           -not too lean
      1 tb Sherry
    1/2 c  Regular soy sauce
      1 c  Water
      2 sl Ginger
      2 cl Garlic, optional
      1 oz Sugar
      2    Star anise stars
           -(optional for pork)
 
  Either brown the roast in a little fat or dunk it in boiling water for a
  minute or so [this step is optional]. Put it into a heavy kettle into which
  it fits fairly snugly. Add all the rest of the ingredients (ginger slices,
  star anise, and garlic should be at the bottom of the pot). Bring to a
  boil, then reduce heat and simmer covered, turning and basting
  occasionally, for 3 hours or until tender. Serve sliced, hot or cold. If
  cold, you may want to weight it down with a brick covered in foil or some
  similarly heavy item while chilling it in the fridge.
  
  You may cook lamb or pork this way, but cut the cooking time to 2 - 2 1/2
  hr. For lamb add a cinnamon stick instead of the star anise; for pork
  double the soy sauce and sherry, either halve or omit the star anise, and
  use up to 4 oz of sugar to taste.

      Title: Rich Venison & Mushroom Stew
 Categories: Meat, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Good stewing venison
           -- (trimmed weight)
      1    Onion
    3/4 lb Small flat mushrooms
  2 1/2 fl Red wine vinegar
  2 1/2 fl Water
    3/4 pt (scant) beef or game stock
           Butter
           Oil
           Flour
           Sugar
           Bay leaves

--------------------------FOR THE FORCEMEAT BALLS--------------------------
      8 oz Fresh breadcrumbs
      8 oz Grated suet
      2    Lemons (grated zest only)
  1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
      1 lg Egg
      3 tb Fresh chopped parsley
 
  Cut the venison into large chunks and marinate for about 24 hours in the
  water and vinegar with 2 bay leaves and plenty of pepper.
  
  Make the forcemeat mixture, seasoning it well and binding it with the
  lightly beaten egg.  Shape into 24 small balls, fry briskly until golden-
  brown and crisp and reserve.  Then fry the mushrooms hard in a very little
  hot fat.  Remove and reserve separately.
  
  Drain and dry the meat well, reserving the marinade.  Dust the venison with
  well-seasoned flour and brown and seal in batches. Transfer it to a 4 pint
  flameproof casserole; ideally this should be no more than 8 inches in
  diameter across the top.  Chop the onion finely and fry gently. Sprinkle on
  2 tablespoons flour, pour on the marinade liquid and the stock over the
  meat and season with salt, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 2 bay leaves.
  
  Bring to a bare simmer, cover tightly and cook over the lowest possible
  flame (or in a low oven if you prefer) until the meat is deliciously tender
  and the gravy is dark and rich.  Shoulder meat may need as little as 1 1/2
  hours, lesser cuts of meat will need considerably more. Stir occasionally
  to prevent sticking.  When ready, remove the bay and check seasoning. Cool
  and refrigerate overnight if not to be served on the same day.
  
  To finish the dish, bring everything back to room temperature.  Add the
  prepared mushrooms to the stew, pushing them well down into the gravy, then
  cover the surface with the forcemeat balls and bake - without a lid to keep
  the forcemeat balls really crisp - at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for about 25
  minutes.

 Categories: Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Fresh picnic shoulder
           -(with bone)
 
  Provides cooked pork for 3 meals
  
  1. Place picnic shoulder on rack in shallow roasting pan.
   If meat thermometer is used, insert it in center of roast so tip does not
  touch bone or fat.
  
  2. Roast, uncovered, at 325øF (slow oven) until done, about 2-1/2 to 3
  hours. To test for doneness, make a small cut next to bone into thicker
  part of meat.
   Juices will be clear when meat is done. Meat thermometer, if used, should
  read 170øF.
  
  3. Remove fat from drippings. Defatted drippings will measure about 2
  tablespoons; save half for Roast Pork with Gravy (p. 46) and half for Pork
  and Cabbage soup (p. 58).
  
  4. Separate meat from rind, fat, and bone. Using the smaller pieces of
  pork, dice and save 1 cup of meat for Pork and Cabbage Soup. Slice
  remaining meat. Save half for sandwiches and half for Roast Pork with
  Gravy.
   Cooked pork will keep 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator.

  Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon of the oil, the remaining cabbage and
  1/2 teaspoon of the caraway. Add all of the wilted cabbage mixture to the
  onion mixture and mix to blend. Season with salt and pepper.
  
  Heat the remaining tablespoon of the oil in the same skillet over high
  heat.  Add the pork, and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Set the
  pork atop the vegetables in the roasting pan.  Add the beer and molasses to
  the skillet and bring to a boil, scraping up all of the browned bits in the
  bottom of the pan.  Pour over the vegetables. Add the broth.
  
  Roast the pork and vegetables for 45 minutes.  Turn the pork over and
  continue roasting until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part
  registers 145F, about 45 minutes.  Place the pork on a cutting board or
  work surface.  Discard the bay leaves.  Use a slotted spoon to place the
  vegetables on a serving platter.  Slice the pork and place on top of the
  vegetables.  Transfer the cooking juices to a small saucepan and boil for 5
  minutes, then spoon over the pork.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: Roast Rabbit or Hare  _llb_
 Categories: Game, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Pepper
    1/2 ts Thyme
      1 ts Marjoram
      4 lb To 5 lb dressed Hare  -OR-
      2 ea Cottontails
    1/4 lb Salt pork; sliced
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 sm Onion; chopped
    1/2 c  Beef or chicken stock

           -jelly
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Pepper
      1 ts Flour stirred with.......
      2 tb Water
 
  ...Rabbits and especially the large hares look appetizing roasted whole...
  ... In this recipe one may marinate hare for two to three days with your
  favorite marinade. If you do marinate, use the strained marinade instead of
  the wine and the vinegar.
  
     Mix the salt, pepper, and the two herbs and rub it all on and inside the
  hare. Truss the front legs and in doing so, tie on slabs of salt pork over
  the saddle [Note this step adds fat to help soften the meat].
     In a shallow roasting pan, roast the hare uncovered for about 30 minutes
  in a 450 degree F oven. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees and roast another
  45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the hare and keep warm.
     Place the roasting pan and contents over a medium heat. Add the wine,
  vinegar, onion and stock and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes. Add the jelly,
  cream, pepper (taste for salt) and quickly dissolve jelly. Stir in the
  flour and water paste and let it thicken a bit before serving in a
  sauceboat.

      Title: Roasted Pig
 Categories: Native, Meat
      Yield: 1 Pig
 
 
  A pig about 3 weeks old is the best. It should be killed in the morning, if
  it is to be eaten at dinner.  Make a stuffing with about 6 powdered
  crackers, 1 T. sage, 2 T. sweet marjoram, half a pint of cream, 2 eggs, and
  a little salt and pepper.  Mix these well together, and let it stew about
  15 minutes.  Then wash the pig in cold water; cut off the petti-toes,
  leaving the skin long to wrap around the ends of the legs; then fill the
  belly with the stuffing and sew it upp. The liver and heart should be
  boiled with 5 or 6 ppeppercorns and chopped fine for the gravy. When the
  pig is put down to roast, put in a pint of water, and a T. of salt; when it
  begins to roast, flour it wll, and baste it with the drippings and continue
  to do so until it is done. It requires constant care. A small pig will
  roast in 3 hours.

      Title: Robert Barnum's Spareribs
 Categories: Pork, Meat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    To 6 pounds meaty spareribs,
           -cut into individual ribs
           -grated zest of 2 limes
    1/4 c  Freshly squeezed lime juice
      1 tb Distilled white vinegar
      2 c  Dry white wine, or water
    1/4    Cuyp light soy sauce
           -(usukuchi)
      2    Cloves garlic, peeled and
           -minced
      1 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
      1 lg Sprig fresh rosemary, or 2
           -tsp crushed dried
      2    Limes, quartered, for
           -garnish
 
  Arrange the spareribs in a single layer of a large non-reactive dish
  (glass, stainless steel).  Whisk together all the ingredients through the
  rosemary in a medium-size bowl, and pour this over the spareribs. Turn the
  ribs so they are moistened on all sides, cover, and refrigerate for at
  least 24 hours, turning them several times so they are evenly marinated.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, or build a good-sized fire in a
  barbecue.
  
  Drain the spareribs, reserving the marinade.  Place them in a non-reactive
  baking pan in one layer (use two baking pans if necessary), and bake in the
  center of the oven, basting frequently, until they are golden, crisp, and
  cooked through, 55 minutes to 1 hour. Turn them occasionally to make sure
  they cook evenly.
  
  If you are using a charcoal grill, spread the coals out when they are red
  and dusted with ash.  Lightly oil the grill rack, and place it about 3
  inches above the coals.  Cook the ribs, basting and turning them, 55
  minutes to 1 hour.
  
  To serve the spareribs, drain off the fat and transfer them to a warmed
  shallow serving bowl or platter.  Garnish with the lime wedges, and provide
  plenty of napkins.

      Title: Roman Pie
 Categories: Meat, Pasta, Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
----------------------------FOR THE MEAT LAYERS----------------------------
      1 lb Cooked turkey or chicken *
    1/4 lb Cooked ham
    1/4 lb Cooked tongue
     50 g  Canned anchovy fillets
    3/4 lb Mushrooms
      1 lg Bunch parsley
           Lemon juice
           A few black olives
           Canned consomme **

----------------------------FOR THE PASTA LAYERS----------------------------
      6 oz Macaroni
 12 1/2 fl Milk
    1/2 pt Single cream
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Plain flour
      4 oz Cheddar cheese
      1 oz Parmesan cheese
 
  *Note: Weight given for turkey or chicken is skinned, boned weight. Goose,
  pheasant and other birds can be used instead.
  
  **Well-flavoured, clear stock and a little gelatine powder may be
  substituted for canned consomme.
  
  Make a smooth, rich sauce with the butter, flour, milk and cream. Let it
  simmer for about 4 minutes.  Then, away from the heat, stir in the grated
  Cheddar and Parmesan, a seasoning of nutmeg and some salt and pepper - but
  go carefully with the salt in view of the cheeses and salted meats used in
  this dish.  Let the sauce cool while you cook the macaroni in plenty of
  salted water until al dente.  Plunge the pasta in cold water to arrest
  cooking, drain well and stir it into the sauce.
  
  Slice the mushrooms thickly and saute them well in a non-stick pan with no
  fat.  Season them with about 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, plenty of pepper
  and a little salt and allow to become cold.  Then cut the turkey meat into
  pieces about the width and half the length of your little finger, and mix
  the poultry and mushrooms together.
  
  Cut the ham, tongue and drained anchovies into strips about the same length
  as the poultry but considerably less wide.  Mix the anchovies, ham and
  tongue with a good quantity of fairly coarsely chopped parsley.
  
  Sprinkle about one third to half of the ham mixture over the base of a
  shallow dish of 4 to 4-1/2 pint capacity.  Cover with half the macaroni
  mixture, then all the turkey mixture, then the rest of the macaroni. Spread
  each layer evenly and press down into the dish with a potato masher before
  adding the next layer.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Arrange the remaining ham mixture on top and scatter the olives to make a
  decorative display of the pink, green and black ingredients. Press down
  lightly then pour on enough barely melted consomme or cool jellied stock to
  cover.
  
  Cover the dish and refrigerate for a few hours until set.  Better still,
  refrigerate Roman pie overnight to allow flavours to blend and mature, but
  be sure to bring it back to room temperature at least two hours before
  serving.

      Title: Sam Arnold's Boneless Rump Roast
 Categories: Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 x  Boneless Rump Roast
      1 x  Salt
      1 x  Fresh Rosemary Needles
      1 x  Garlic Salt
      1 x  Freshly Ground Black Pepper
      1 x  Beer; OR
      1 x  Wine; OR
      1 x  Vinegar; OR
      1 x  Lemon Juice
      1 x  Beef Stock; OR
      1 x  Red Wine
      1 x  Minced Shallots
 
  NOTE:  This recipe is adjustable to all sizes of roasts. This is the
  Marinate the meat for a couple of hours in a liquid that is slightly
  acidic--a liquid such as wine, beer, vinegar, or lemon juice. Roast for 15
  minutes per pound at 325 degrees F.  For the last 15 minutes, cook at 500
  degrees F.  For example, for a 4 pound roast, total cooking time is 1 hour
  but it will be 45 minutes at 325 degrees F. and 15 minutes at 500 degrees
  F.  This will crust the outside of the roast and the inside will be medium,
  barely pink.
   This is based on room temperature meat.  If the meat is quite cold, extend
  the baking time.  After 3/4 of the cooking time, sprinkle with salt and
  some fresh or dry rosemary needles. Turn the roast with WOODEN SPOONS (Very
  important that you do not pierce the meat) and season it all over.
  Rosemary, seasoned salt or garlic salt are nice, and some freshly ground
  black pepper adds to the flavor also. Swab the roast with some fresh lemon
  juice--this will also add to the zing of the meat. When cooked, snip off
  the cords and slice to serve. From the roasting pan, spoon off the fat from
  the accumulated juice.  Add some beef stock or red wine to the juices, a
  few minced shallots or green onion shreds and cook down at high heat to a
  reduction or concentrated sauce. Adjust the seasonings, salt, pepper, and
  herbs of your choice, and serve with the roast.

  water, core head and separate leaves. Wash each leaf and drain in colander.
  Wash sauerkraut and drain.
  
  Brown onion lightly in fat. Mix with meat, garlic, rice, seasonings and
  egg.

      Title: Sate Manis - Sweet Satay
 Categories: Meat, Marinades, Sauces
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Filet or rump steak,
           - or pork fillet
      1 tb Palm sugar =OR=
      1 tb Dark brown sugar
      1 ea Clove garlic; crushed
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Oil
      1 ts Ground cumin

--------------------------------SATAY SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Peanut sauce (saus kacang)
      2 tb Tamarind liquid =OR=
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 ts Sambal bajak
      3 tb To 4 water
 
  Cut beef or pork into 3/4 inch cubes.  Thread 4-5 cubes on each bamboo
  skewer, not pushing them too close together.  If skewers have been soaked
  in cold water for an hour or so beforehand, it prevents them burning when
  satay is cooked.  Combine sugar with garlic, salt, soy sauce, oil and
  cumin.  Stir until sugar dissolves.  Pour into a long shallow dish and put
  satay in the marinade, turning each one so the marinade coats the meat.
  Cover and refrigerate for a few hours.
  
  Cook over glowing coals or under a hot grill for approximately 15 minutes,
  not too close to the source of heat for pork must be well done; even beef
  is always well cooked, never rare, in satay.  Turn skewers every 5 minutes,
  and brush with marinade.  Serve hot accompanied with satay sauce.
  
  Satay Sauce: Combine all ingredients and serve in a bowl. The sauce is
  spooned over the satay before eating.

 Categories: Sauces, Meat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
--------------------------FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE--------------------------
      5    Kumquats
      3    Bay leaves
      9    Whole cloves; bruised
    3/4 pt Stock, pref. from tongue
      1 lg Orange (juice only)
      2 ts Lemon juice
      1 tb Tarragon vinegar
    3/4 oz Butter
      2 tb Flour
           Salt and pepper
      4 tb Thick cream

-------------------------FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE-------------------------
      1    Garlic clove
      1 oz Parsely; chopped
    1/2 oz Chives
  1 1/2 oz Capers
      1 sm Lemon; juice & zest only
      8 fl Oil
           Black pepper
 
  FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE: Slice and remove the pips from the kumquats. Put
  them into a pan with the bay leaves, cloves, stock, orange juice, lemon
  juice and tarragon vinegar. Bring very slowly to the boil. Add a little
  salt and pepper, cover and set aside for 20 minutes to infuse. Strain,
  reserving the kumquats, liquid and spices separately. Make a smooth sauce
  with the butter, flour and cooking liquid. Return spices to the pan and
  simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. Stir regularly to prevent sticking and to
  stop a skin from forming. By the end of this time, the sauce should be the
  consistency of cream; if necessary boil it hard for 2-3 minutes to reduce
  and thicken it a little. Strain to extract the spices, stir in the cream,
  then the kumquats. Reheat gently, adding a few pinches of ground cloves,
  more lemon juice and other seasonings to taste.
  
  FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE:  Crush the garlic clove with a little salt. Then
  process it briefly with the chopped parsley, chives and capers. Add the
  lemon juice and zest, and the oil and whizz again until the mixture is
  reduced to a thickened fragrant green puree. Add a coarse grinding of black
  pepper and leave it for 1 hour or so to allow the flavours to blend.

      Title: Sausage Casings
 Categories: Makemeat, Meat
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Casings can be made from the intestines of beef, hogs, or sheep, the sheep
  casings being used for small sausage like wiener-wurst, and the hog casings
  for link sausages, and beef for Bologna, sausage, ham sausage, and blood
  sausage.  Empty as soon as possible, turn inside out and scrape and clean
  first the in and then the outside.  The cleaning is easy where one has
  running water.  Soak 24 hours in lime water or lye water, turn, scrape and
  rinse again, then salt down and use when needed. When one cannot clean the
  casings, good substitutes can be made by stitching up tubes of new
  unbleached muslin, 1 1/2 or 2 feet long, and 2 or 3 INCHES in diameter,
  when filled.  When ready to hang away, rub the outside well with melted
  lard, to exclude all air, and sprinkle with pepper.

      Title: Sausage: Casing Information & Preparation
 Categories: Makemeat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Information Only
 
  Sausage has to be stuffed into something and that something is most often
  the intestine of a hog, cow, or sheep. Before you gasp, rest assured that
  these casings are kept scruplously  clean and are packed in salt which
  keeps them fresh indefinitely. Natural casings come in an array of sizes,
  ranging from under one inch to a lillt over four inches in diameter. The
  smallest are usually sheep casings, 1/2" to 1 1/16" and the largest are
  from beef, 2 1/2" to 4'. think of sheep casings as being the size of most
  hot dogs, and beef casings the size of a large salami. The hog casings are
  the most common since many sausages are made in the two inch diameter
  range. Their sizes range from small (1 1/2 inch), medium (2 inch), and
  large (2 1/2 inches). all should be kept refrigerated or frozen until ready
  to use. You should be familiar with two other types of casing; collagen and
  muslin. Collagen casings are made of natural, pure, edible protein. They
  generally cost a little more than intestines, are sometimes a little harder
  to find, but are convienent to use and usually can be substituted freely
  for recipes calling for natural casings. Muslin casings can be purchased or
  homemade and are sometimes used with summer sausage and salami. One needn't
  be a Betsy Ross to stitch up a muslin casing. Just follow the instructions
  given in Chapter 4.
  
  Muslin Casing: You will need a piece of unbleached muslin about 12" long
  and 8" wide. Fold the muslin lengthwise and tightly stitch a seam across
  one of the short ends and continue along the open side. Keep the stitching
  about an eight of an inch from the edge of the material. The short side of
  the seam can be curved in a semi-circle to give the finished product a
  rounded end. Turn the casing inside out so that the stitching is on the
  inside. Set it aside until you are ready to stuff it.
  
  Casing Preparation: Snip off about four feet of casing. (Better too much
  than too little because any extra can be repacked in salt and used later.)
  Rinse the casing under cool running water to remove any salt clinging to
  it. Place it in a bowl of cool water and let it soak for about a half an
  hour. While waiting for the casing to soak, you can begin preparing the
  meat. After soaking, rinse the casing under cool running water. Slip one
  end of the casing over the faucet nozzle. Hold the casing firmly on the
  nozzle, and turn the cold water on, gently at first, and then more
  forcefully. This procedure will flush out any salt in the casing and
  pinpoint any breaks. Should you find a break, simply snip out a small
  section of the casing. Place the casig in a bowl of water and add a splash
  of white vinegar. A tablespoon of vinegar per cup of water is sufficient.
  The vinegar softens the casing a bit more and makes it more transparent,
  which in turn makes your sausage more pleasing to the eye. Leave the casing
  in the water/vinegar solution until you are ready to use it. Rinse it well
  and drain before stuffing.

 Categories: European, Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Veal scaloppine
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
           Salt and freshly ground
           Pepper to taste
    1/4 c  Butter
      1 tb Olive oil
           Juice of 2 lemons
      3 tb Chopped parsley
      2    Garlic cloves - chopped
      2 tb Capers
 
   Place scaloppine between 2 pieces of waxed paper and pound until thin.
  When pounding meat do not use a straight up-and-down movement. Use a
  sliding action so meat is stretched more than flattened (I use the edge of
  a saucer for this).  Coat meat lightly with flour. Sprinkle with salt and
  pepper.  Melt 3 tablespoons butter with oil in a large heavy skillet. When
  butter foams, add veal.  Cook over high heat about 1 minute on each side.
  Veal should be light golden outside and pink inside.
   Place veal on a warm platter.  Add 1 tablespoon butter and lemon juice to
  skillet.  Deglaze skillet by stirring to disolve meat juices attached to
  bottom of skillet.  Stir in parsley, garlic and capers. Taste and adjust
  sauce for seasoning, then spoon over veal. Serve immediately.

 Categories: Ethnic, Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Fresh Rabbit
      6 oz Streaky Bacon
      6    Button onions
      4 tb Butter
      1 tb Flour
      1 tb Curry-powder
      1 ts Mushroom-powder
           Celery (optional)
           Coco-nut (optional)
           Salt and cayenne to taste
      1 pt Well seasoned stock
 
  Choose a fat, fresh rabbit.  (To test it, examine the kidney.)  Cut it into
  at least twelve pieces; brown these in butter, with onions. When browned,
  if you wish delicate cookery, pour off the butter and add three-quarters of
  a pint of well-seasoned stock, one large spoonful of curry-powder and one
  of flour, six ounces of streaky bacon cut into half inch cubes, and also
  half a dozen button onions. Season with a teaspoonful of mushroom powder.
  Simmer this slowly for half an hour at least, stirring it. Add what more
  seasonings you think required, as cayenne, a little turmeric, or some acid.
  Pile up the pieces of rabbit and pour the sauce, which should be thickish
  as in all curry dishes, over them. Serve with plain boiled rice in a
  separate dish.
  
  Fresh coco-nut is an excellent ingredient in mild curries.  Rasp and stew
  it the whole time; we do not like green vegetables in curries though they
  are sometimes used.  Mushrooms are an enrichment, celery is good, and onion
  is indispensable.

      Title: Siberian Pelmeni (Meat-Filled Noodles with Va
 Categories: Asian, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      2    Egg yolks
    2/3 c  Water, plus or minus 1 tb
    1/2 lb Ground beef
    1/2 lb Ground pork
      2    Onions, minced
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/4 lb Fresh mushrooms, chopped
           - fine, optional
           Pepper vinegar, optional
           Sour cream, optional
           Brown butter, optional
           Spicy tomato sauce, optional
 
    Culinary success "depends, above all, on one's ability to communicate
  with other people, to let one's self be inspired by other people, or to
  pull them under one's spell," writes Markus Wolf in the introduction to his
  new cookbook, "The Secrets of Russian Cooking."
  
    Cold Warriors and thriller devotees will recall Wolf as the long-time
  head of East Germany's Main Intelligence Administration, usually known by
  its German initials, HVA, and considered the most effective foreign spying
  agency from Berlin to Bucharest.
  
    This is Markus Wolf's favorite dish. He says this version of the recipe
  was given to him by his late brother, Konrad, who is a central figure in
  Wolf's nostalgic 1987 memoir, "The Troika." Wolf describes the "joy of
  companionship" that is achieved when you hand your guests aprons and invite
  them to take part in the process of making pelmeni. He adds that a glass of
  vodka is a must with pelmeni.
  
    Put flour in bowl. Press hollow in middle and add salt and egg yolks and
  1/2 cup water. Using knife or big spoon, mix egg yolks first with water and
  then some of flour. Slowly add rest of water until mixture forms dough.
  Knead dough with both hands until workable and free of lumps. If dough is
  too sticky, add some flour. Dough should form solid ball.
    Sprinkle thin layer of flour onto flat surface. Divide dough into 3
  pieces. Roll out 1 piece of dough until thin. Keep remaining dough covered
  under damp towel. Cut dough in circles about 2 inches in diameter. Repeat
  with remaining dough.
    Combine beef, pork, onions, garlic and mushrooms in bowl. Place 1
  teaspoon meat mixture on each dough circle, then bend other side and press
  to seal, forming half-moons. Use some water, if necessary, brushed lightly
  on edges to make them stick. Keep finished pelmeni either on waxed paper or
  board sprinkled with flour.
    Pelmeni can be frozen at this point and cooked later.
    Cook 20 to 25 pelmeni at a time, uncovered, in plenty of rapidly boiling
  lightly salted water, about 5 minutes. Repeat until all pelmeni are cooked.
    Serve pelmeni either in clear soup (beef or, preferably, poultry) or as
  main course with pepper vinegar, sour cream, brown butter or spicy tomato
  sauce.
    Makes 60 pelmeni, or 4 main-course servings.

      Title: Simple Marinade
 Categories: Condiments, Meat
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 tb Soy sauce (dark)
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 ts Oil
      1    Garlic clove
 
  Crush the garlic and mix all ingredients together.  Add meat (steak) and
  leave for at least 1 hour, the longer the better.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple and quite superb meat marinade -- This is a truly wonderful
  marinade.  Just take the steak out of the freezer in the morning before you
  go to work and pop it in the marinade. Yield: 1 serving .
  
  *  The recipe calls for 1 clove of garlic, but we often use 2 or more. Be
  careful with the Soy Sauce, if it is too salty the marinade is not so good.
  This basic mixture can be varied infinitely; particularly, you can use more
  marinade than this for one piece of meat. I like to use sesame oil, or
  mustard oil for a little "bite" instead of a bland vegetable oil.

      Title: Simplified Smithfield Cure for Hams
 Categories: Meat, Preserves, Pork
      Yield: 1 Ham
 
      1    Pork leg (min 5 lbs) boned
      1 lb White sea salt **
      6 oz Saltpetre
    1/2 lb Granulated sugar
           English brine
 
    NB Use Tidman's or Maldon salt, not gros sel (US Kosher salt? IMH)
  "Smithfield hams come from a small village in Virginia, and have nothing to
  do with Smithfield Meat Market in London. They are famous for their mild,
  sweet cure. This is the kind of ham to serve with pickled peaches, or
  spiced apples, or pineapple, and here is a simplified method. JG"
    Mix together the salt, sugar and saltpetre, and rub the boned leg with
  it. Pay particular attention to the part of the leg which is not covered by
  the skin, and where the bone came from. Leave the meat in the salt.
    Next day do the same thing all over again, and the two days following.
  Four days of dry cure in all.
    Scrape off any salt that is still clinging, and put the leg into English
  Brine for six or seven days. String it firmly into a neat tubular shape.
    If you have a good drying place (cool, airy, the temperature between 50ø
  and 60øF, without violent fluctuations, no direct sunlight), squeeze the
  ham of as much moisture as possible and hang it up in a boiled string bag,
  for twenty days.
    If you can't be sure of drying the ham properly, let it hang for several
  days only.
    Cook like a Jambon de Paris. (This ham can be smoked, but only to give it
  a light golden colour.)

      Title: Snippets of Venison
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Best venison trimmings
      2 fl Cider
      4 fl Good stock
      6 oz Cap mushrooms
      1 bn Chives
           Garlic
           Juniper
           Unsalted butter
      4 fl Soured cream or Greek yogurt
 
  Cut the meat into strips about the size of your thumb - if possible. Some
  of the trimmings may, of course, be slightly ragged, triangular or cubed
  but this is the size and shape to aim for.  Dust with coarsely ground black
  pepper and 3 to 4 crushed juniper berries, moisten with the cider, cover
  and leave to marinate for 24 hours. Crush a garlic clove, mix it with the
  soured cream or yoghurt and leave it to infuse in a cool place for 24
  hours.
  
  Carefully drain and dry the venison, reserving the marinade.  Slice the
  mushrooms thickly and saute them in a little very hot butter. Remove and
  keep hot.  Then saute the venison briefly, searing it nicely but keeping it
  succulent and pink within - 2 minutes is plenty. Then let the venison rest
  in a low oven where it will go on cooking a little without toughening.
  Start making the sauce straight away or wait for several minutes if you
  want the meat to lose its pinkness.
  
  To make the sauce, let the marinade liquid and the stock bubble away in the
  frying pan until reduced to just 2 or 3 spoonfuls.  Blend in any juices
  that the venison has exuded and bubble again briefly. Then beat in the
  garlic-flavoured soured cream, away from the heat. Return the pan to a low
  flame to warm the sauce.  Season well, scatter with chopped chives and
  serve on very hot plates.

      Title: Southern Style Pork Chops
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Pork chops,
           -about 1/2 inch
           Shortening or oil
      4    Onion slices (we
           -like these fairly thick)
    1/4 c  Peanut butter
    1/4 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Mushroom soup, condensed
           -(or make a mushroom-
           -flavored white sauce)
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Black pepper
 
  In a frying pan big enough to hold all of the chops at once,  brown pork
  chops on both sides in a little shortening or oil. Pour off fat, leaving
  chops in frying pan. Place an onion slice on top of each chop.
  
  Mix peanut butter, mushroom soup, milk, Worcestershire sauce, salt and
  pepper. Pour over chops. Cover and simmer over medium to low heat for 45
  minutes. You may want to move the chops around in the pan from time to time
  to keep them from sticking.
  
  Smooth peanut butter is best.  The chunky variety gives a strange
  consistency to this dish.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pork chops in mushroom peanut-butter sauce -- I originally found this
  recipe in the "Woman's Day Encyclopedia of Cookery."  It is very easy to
  prepare and makes a hearty main dish served over rice or noodles.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes browning, 45 minutes simmering.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: Spicy Fresh Country Sausage
 Categories: Main dish, Makemeat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Source: Hotlinks and
           -Country Flavors, Aidells
           -and Kelly, 1990
           -Makes: 4-5 pounds
 
  3 lb.     pork butt 3/4-1 lb. pork back fat 4 tsp. kosher salt (or use
  canning salt) 2 tsp. coarsely ground black pepper 2 tsp. dried sage (ugh,
  you don't have to use this!) 1 tsp. dried thyme 2 tsp. sugar 1 Tbls. red
  pepper flakes 1 tsp. cayenne 1/2 Cup water Medium hog casings (optional)
  
  Put the meat and fat through the meat grinder, using the 1/4-inch plate,
  (or use food processor). In a large bowl, mix the ground pork, fat, spices,
  herbs, and water, kneading and squeezing the meat until everything is
  nicely blended. If you are making the sausage for patties, simply wrap it
  in bulk and refrigerate (or freeze) it. Or stuff the seasoned meat into
  medium hog casings and tie into 4-inch links. Fresh sausage will keep for 3
  days in the refrigerator, frozen for up to 2 months.
  
  This recipe gives the basics of sausage making and can be varied. You can
  mix in one or more herbs like marjoram, summer savory, or dried rosemary
  along with a spice like nutmeg, cloves, allspice, or ginger. A good rule of
  thumb is to add 1/2 tsp. of a dried herb and/or a pinch of spice to the
  basic recipe. Two tsp. of minced garlic can also be added. Fry up a small
  patty to test and taste, and mix in more flavor as you go.
  
  Southern farm wives used to stuff bulk sausage into small muslin bags or
  'pokes', or fry patties and layer them in their own fat for preservation
  over the winter. The modern alternative is freezing.

      Title: Spicy Kebabs
 Categories: Meat, Bbq
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 lb Pork or lamb
           -(boneless), lean, cut
           -into 1 1/2 inch cubes
    1/4 c  Peanut butter, smooth
      1 ts Coriander, ground
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper (or more,
           -to taste)
      1 ts Cumin, ground
    1/2 ts Pepper
      4    Onions
      1    Garlic clove, minced
  1 1/2 ts Lemon juice
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 tb Soy sauce
 
  Grate the onions.  This is best done using a food processor.  Mincing is
  not good enough; you want to end up with something wet and mushy. Don't
  stick your nose into the food processor.
  
  Put all the ingredients into a large bowl, mix well, and cover. Refrigerate
  for several hours, mixing occasionally.
  
  Put meat cubes on skewers, keeping as much of the onion mixture on them as
  you can. Grill over hot coals, turning to brown each side, for 20 to 25
  minutes or until meat is cooked through. (Lamb should still be slightly
  pink; pork should not.)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spicy pork or lamb kebabs -- I copied this from a newspaper or magazine
  a long time ago; I forget where. It was originally for pork, but it's good
  with lamb, too.
  
  *  You could probably put some vegetables (onions, bell peppers) on the
  skewers between the meat chunks; watch out that the veggies don't burn.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, several hours marinating, 30 minutes
  cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: Spinach & Stilton Pancakes
 Categories: Breads, Cheese, Meatless
      Yield: 18 Servings
 
------------------------------FOR THE PANCAKES------------------------------
      2 oz Buckwheat flour
      2 oz Plain white flour
      2    Eggs
      2 tb Butter; melted
    1/4 pt Milk
    1/4 pt Water

------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
      2 lb Fresh spinich
      1 lg Onion
      3 oz Stilton cheese
      2 oz Walnut pieces
           Butter
      1    Garlic sliver

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Plain white flour
    1/2 pt Stock
    1/4 pt Double cream
      2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
      1 ts (heaped) Dijon mustard
 
  Make a smooth batter with the flours, eggs, milk and water, then stir in
  the cool melted butter for extra richness and to prevent sticking during
  cooking.  Use a 6-inch pan and make thin pancakes in the usual way, but be
  sure to stir the batter vigorously in between making each pancake or all
  the buckwheat flour will sink to the bottom of the mixture. If preparing
  ahead, cool the pancakes then stack them (interleaved with greaseproof
  paper) and wrap in a foil parcel.
  
  To make the filling, wash and boil or steam the spinach until just tender.
  Chop it and squeeze out all the liquid (save the juices for a soup). Chop
  the onion finely and sweat it in a knob of butter until it's deliciously
  soft.  Stir in the spinach, season with a little salt, lots of pepper and
  the garlic.  Toast the walnuts and crumbled Stilton into the spinach
  mixture to give it savoury flavour and bite. Stuff the pancakes with the
  mixture, roll them up neatly and pile them into a lightly buttered gratin
  dish.  Cover with foil and heat through in the oven for 25-30 minutes at
  400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.
  
  Make a smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock (preferably good
  chicken stock) and cream.  Let it simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring once
  or twice, then season with the cheese, mustard and salt and pepper. If the
  sauce is made ahead, reheat it in a double-boiler for serving, then pour it
  over the dish of pancakes just before bringing to table.

      Title: Spit-Roasted Pig
 Categories: Meat, Bbq
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    100 lb Pig
 
  You need time, friends, and funds to spit-roast a pig.  Find a source and
  order the pig, rent a spit from the yellow pages of your telephone book.
  Select your site out of the wind and rain and prepare the firebed, after
  you have picked up the spit and before you pick up the pig. When you pick
  up the pig, secure it on the spit, allowing at least 2 hours for this job.
  More on that later.
  
  THE PIG. Order a pig weighing 100 pounds or less. a 100 pound pig makes 100
  servings.  You may have to wait up to one month to get the size pig you
  want.  Shop around for the best prices.  If the pig arrives a day or so
  ahead, have it held for you in the market's refrigerator. After spitting
  the pig, you can keep it cold for up to 14 hours. Place pig on a plastic
  sheet in a cool place; drape it with sealed plastic bags filled with ice.
  Cover with another sheet of plastic; protect from animals and insects.
  Replace ice as it melts.
  
  PREPARING THE FIRE BED: You'll need a shovel, the spit-roasting equipment,
  20 pounds of sand, 14 concrete blocks (6- by 6- by 12 inch size) about 120
  pounds of long burning charcoal briquets, fire starter and matches, a
  garden rake long handled tongs, potholder mitts and a large box of baking
  soda. Clear a level 3- by 5-foot area down to the soil. Down the center,
  spread sand in a 1 1/2- by 3-foot rectangle. Set spit supports at 3-foot
  ends of rectangle and put spit in position. Adjust supports so that spit is
  20 to 24 inches above ground and centered. Line perimeter of area with
  concrete blocks (open sides up) to make a solid wall.
  
  SPIT ROASTING EQUIPMENT. You need a spit at least 7 feet long and forks to
  keep the pig from slipping.
  
  SPITTING & TYING THE PIG: A TEAM OPERATION. Allow at least 2 hours for
  spitting and tying. first, insert spit through mouth and out tail of pig;
  one person pushes spit, the other guides it along backbone. Spit should not
  pierce any bone or meat. Make sure pig is centered on spit. Next, wire spin
  to spit. You'll need three 24-inch lengths of heavy wire, an ice pick, and
  pliers. At mid back, make a hole on each side of spine with an ice pick,
  poking from rib side out through the skin. Working from skin side, force
  the 2 ends of 1 wire through holes in pig cavity. With pliers, twist wire
  ends together over spit, securely uniting spit and spine (spine curves and
  may actually not touch spit). Position remaining 2 wires about 12" away
  from center wire on either side. Force metal spit forks firmly and securely
  into thickest parts of hind and shoulder ends; clap or wire spit forks
  tightly to secure spit.  Use double strands of heavy cotton string to tie
  front and rear legs to spit.  Because legs are stiff, this task may require
  brute strength.  To hold skin in place as it cooks, make a string net over
  rib loin sections.  Suspend spit between 2 counters, so you can pass string
  under and around pig. First tie string tightly at 3" intervals around body
  between front and rear legs. Then wrap strings at right angles to make 3"
  squares. Once pig is spitted and tied, position it on spit supports and
  rotate to make sure the equipment works and that pig is balanced. A
  well-balanced pig that doesn't shift its weight on the spit is essential.
  Remove pig and keep cool while you start the fire.
  
  ROASTING THE PIG. Pile ten pounds of charcoal briquets at each end of
  firebed and ignite.  When coals are ash-covered and glowing hot (about 1
  hour) set spitted pig on supports.  Rake coals into even layer underneath
  pig.  Begin rotating pig.  Continue rotating throughout cooking. After
  about 1 hour, when fat begins to drip, rake briquets from directly beneath
  pit to expose sand.  Arrange coals so most are underneath thickest parts of
  pig, with 6"-8"-wide band of coals along sides of pig. To keep skin from
  charring, sprinkle any grease fires with baking soda to smother flames.
  About every 30 minutes, rake briquets to knock off ash. Add 10 pounds of
  briquets about every hour to maintain heat. After about 10 hours, fat will
  cease dripping excessively; at this point, rake hot coals back beneath pig,
  concentrating heat under thighs and shoulders. Internal temperature in
  thickest part of animal at bone should be 140F on a rapid-reading
  thermometer.  Check temperature in several places. A spit-roasted pig
  exposed to the air often reaches only 140-150, but if cooking continues at
  this temperature for at least 1 hour, the meat is both safe and very
  palatable to eat.  Cooking typically takes 10-12 hours, though breezy or
  cool weather will slow it down. If the pig is ready before the rest of the
  meal, rake coals from beneath pig so it will cease cooking but stay hot;
  keep hot on spit for up to 1 hour.
  
  To serve, transfer spitted pig to a large table topped with a pig-size tray
  of heavy foil, pull out spit and cut off strings. Garnish pig with parsley.
  Pull off skin; tear or carve meat from bones. Season to taste.

      Title: Squid Sausage
 Categories: Makemeat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 md Squid, about 6-7" long
      1 cl Garlic, finely minced
      1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/2 ts Oregano
      1 ts Salt, or to taste
      1 ts Coarse grind black pepper
      1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
      1 tb PLUS -see next ingredient-
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Dry vermouth
      2 c  Crushed tomatoes
 
  To clean the squid: cut off the tentacles and reserve. Cut off and discard
  the mouth which is in the center of the tentacles. Under cold running
  water, peel off the outer skin and discard. Squeeze the body to push out
  the insides, pulling off the head when the insides are out. Pull out the
  center bone (it looks like a piece of clear plastic) and discard. Turn the
  body inside out and rinse well. Turn back and rinse. Dry on paper towels.
  Chop the tentacles coarsely in the food processor. Add the garlic, parsley,
  oregano, salt, and peppre. Process until blended. Add the bread crumbs and
  one tb of the oil. Mix well. Fill the bodies of the squid. Fill between
  half and three quarters full. If you over fill them they will burst when
  cooking. Either skewer them closed or shut with toothpicks or roughly
  stitch with cotton thread and a needle. Heat remaining olive oil in a
  skillet and add the squid. Turn often to prevent sticking. Cook until
  lightly browned. Add the vermouth and saute until the wine has nearly
  evaporated. Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer 20 minutes, uncovered.
  Serve warm.

      Title: Steak Au Poivre
 Categories: Steak
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    Sirloin strip steaks
           (1-1/2" thick)
  1 1/2 tb Black peppercorns
      1 ts Or more salt
      3 tb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Salad oil
    1/3 c  Cognac or bourbon
 
  About 2 hours before cooking -
  
  Steaks at room temperature.  Trim excess fat.  Crush peppercorns, coarse.
  Sprinkle top of each steak with 1 to 1-1/2 tspns. ground peppercorns.
  Press into meat with plam of hand.  Turn and repeat on other side.  About
  2 minutes before putting steaks on to cook, sprinkle 1 side with salt,
  using about 1/2 tspn. for each steak.
  
  Heat butter and oil in frying pan over medium heat.  When fat is sizzling,
  but not smoking, (if it smokes it's too hot.  Throw it out and start
  again) place the steaks salted side down in hot fat. Steak will sizzle as
  it hits.  Then shake pan lightly.  Cook 3 minutes that side.  Shake back
  and forth gently. Then salt the other side, and cook 3 minutes that side.
  
  Reduce heat to medium or below.  Turn steaks again and cook a further 3
  minutes on each side (3 each side searing, 3 each side cooking for really
  rare, 4 and 4 for medium rare.)
  
  Remove steak to hot platter and keep warm.  Shake pan well.  Remove from
  heat. Pour cognac or bourbon into pan.  Ignite.  Hold pan. Shake gently
  until flames die down (burns off excess fat and lifts brown glaze.)  Pour
  over steak and serve immediately.
  
  It's DELICIOUS, and very easy to prepare.  ENJOY!!

      Title: Steak Salad Marinated in Orange Juice & Hot Chile Sesame
 Categories: Newspaper, Meat, Salads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Orange juice; fresh squeezed
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil (divided use)
      4 tb Red wine vinegar (divided)
        ds Hot chile sesame oil;
           .  several
           Salt & pepper to taste
      1    Red bell pepper; julienned
      2 lb Strip sirloin, flank steak
      8    Portobello mushrooms; stem
           .  removed
     16    New potatoes; washed
      1 bn Scallions; green & white
           .  parts w/ root end cut off
      4 lg Handfuls mixed greens
           .  any kind
           Cilantro
 
  1. For the salad dressing: Put 2 tablespoons of orange juice in a bowl big
  enough to hold the peppers and a vinaigrette. Add 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 2
  tablespoons of the red wine vinegar, 2 or 3 dashes hot chile sesame oil,
  salt and pepper to taste. Then whisk and correct seasonings. Put peppers
  into the vinaigrette and leave them there.
  
  2. For the marinade: Take half the remaining orange juice, add to it (this
  recipe is not very precise because it doesn't have to be) 2 tablespoons
  vegetab}e oil, 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, a couple dashes hot chile
  sesame oil and salt and pepper to taste. Add meat. A good way to marinate
  the meat is in a tightly closed plastic bag, turning often. The meat should
  marinate for half an hour to an hour, no longer.
  
  3. Now using the rest of the orange juice, make the same marinade as above,
  and brush the mushrooms with it, rebrushing as often as you can for about
  half an hour.
  
  4. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, drop in the potatoes, and cook
  them for 15 minutes or so, until a knife pierces them easily. Drain and cut
  them in half, so they'll be able to react to the dressing. Keep them
  slightly warm, if you can. (If not, don't worry about it.)
  
  5. Broil or grill the mushrooms first (a grill is great for this), then the
  scallions. Cut the scallions in half after they're grilled. Keep these
  vegetables slightly warm, if you can, or don't, if you can't. Now grill the
  steak, to the desired degree of doneness, let it rest a few minutes, then
  slice on the diagonal.
  
  6. To compose the salad, put the greens onto a big platter first, then add
  potatoes and toss well with dressing and peppers, whisking the dressing
  first to make sure it's still well incorporated. Now put the scallions on,
  in a crisscross pattern, then lay the mushrooms on top. Make a well in the
  center of the platter, then layer the steak prettily. Snip the cilantro, if
  you're using it, sprinkle on top, and serve right away, passing the hot
  bread.

 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
------------------------------------LOAF------------------------------------
      2 lb Hamburger
      1    Egg
      1 ds Nutmeg
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/2 c  Mushroom soup
           -concentrate, canned
    1/2 c  Onion, chopped
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/3 c  Marinara sauce
           -(or spaghetti sauce
           -or pizza sauce)
      2    Garlic cloves,  minced
      2 ts Seasoned salt (or use
           -a mixture of salt,
           -pepper, cayenne and
           -celery seed)

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      8 oz Canned mushroom soup
           -concentrate (use the
           -rest of the can)
      3 oz Mushrooms, sliced
    1/2 c  Sour cream
    1/4 c  Drippings (from
           -baking the loaf)
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Mix all ingredients together well, shape
  into loaf and put into a pan. If you use a roasting rack instead of a bread
  pan, the loaf will be less greasy and you can use some of the drippings to
  make the sauce. Bake 20 minutes uncovered at 425 degrees F. Turn down the
  oven to 375 degrees F. and continue baking, uncovered, for 55 more minutes.
  
  MAKE THE SAUCE:  Fry the mushrooms in the drippings and then combine the
  drippings and mushrooms with the mushroom soup and sour cream. Heat this
  mixture in a sauce pan.  When meatloaf is done, put on a plate, cover with
  sauce, slice and eat.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick and flavorful meat loaf -- This is my own adaptation of a recipe
  I got many years ago from a Campbell's soup cookbook. It usually gets rave
  reviews from guests.  Yield:  serves 4-6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 1/2 hours cooking.

      Title: Super Duper Pot Roast
 Categories: Beef, Roast
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 lb Beef chuck (about 1 1/2"
           Thick)
      1 tb Shortening
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/2 ts Hot pepper sauce
      2 ts Worchestershire sauce
      2 tb Vinegar
      1 lg Onion, sliced
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
 
  Turn oven on.  Brown the roast in the shortening in the Dutch oven,
  uncovered, on medium heat on range surface unit.  When browned on one
  side, turn and sprinke the browned side with half the salt, black pepper,
  hot pepper sauce and worchestershire sauce.  When second side is browned,
  turn and sprinkle with rest of seasonings.
  
  Dribble the vinegar evenly over the roast, cover with the onion slices and
  on these place the half stick of butter, cut into chunks.  Cover closely
  and cook in oven till tender, about 3 hrs. If adding vegetables (peeled
  and halved medium size potatoes, split carrots and halved medium sized
  onions) add them after the roast has cooked about 1 1/2 hrs.  Spoon some
  of the liquid from the roast ove them and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
  Continue cooking until roast and vegetables are tender. Note: I sometimes
  cook this roast in a 350^ oven for 30 min. then turn the oven down to
  250^.  This gets it off to a quicker start, and shortens cooking time to
  about 2 1/2 hrs.

      Title: Sur Le Gril Chopped Liver
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Fresh Calves' Liver
      2 tb Salad Oil
      3 tb Butter
      1 ea Large Spanish Onion, chopped
      1 ea Egg, hard-cooked, mashed
      1 x  Salt
      1 x  Freshly Ground Pepper
 
  With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes from liver. In a heavy
  skillet, heat oil and add chopped onions. Cook over medium high heat until
  translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
  Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver pieces. Over medium
  heat, fry liver until just done - 3 minutes on each side. Alternatively,
  liver can be brushed with butter and broiled. To test for doneness, cut a
  piece from liver slice. If still pink, continue cooking for 30 - 60
  seconds. Overcooking causes the liver to be dry and tough. For finely
  mashed egg that disappears in the liver mixture, force egg through a wire
  strainer. For best results, separate the hard cooked whites from yolks and
  sieve them separately. Set aside. Fit meat grinder with a medium blade and
  place cooked liver and cooked onions in the grinder. Grind, then regrind
  the ground mixture. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the twice ground meat
  and onions mixture with the sieved eggs. Add salt and pepper. Taste and
  adjust seasoning. If desired, add a few drops of commercial gravy browning
  liquid to heighten color. Refrigerate for 24 hours before serving. Serve
  with slices of tomato, cucumber and dark rye bread. Serves 4. By Sur Le
  Gril's chef Claude Dubourg. From The Gazette, 91/02/06.

      Title: Tabasco Classic - Grillades for Brunch
 Categories: Beef, Meat, Peppers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Veal Or Beef, 1/2" Thick,
           - Trimmed And Cut Into Small
           - Serving Pieces
    1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
    1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour
      1 c  Chopped Onion
  1 1/2 c  Chopped Green Pepper
      2    Minced Cloves Garlic
      1 c  Chopped Fresh Tomatoes
    1/2 ts Dried Thyme
    3/4 c  Beef Broth
    1/2 c  Red Wine
    3/4 ts Salt
      1    Bay Leaf
      2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
      1 tb Worcestershire Sauce
      3 tb Chopped Fresh Parsley
 
  Grillades are a southern breakfast specialty that always meets an
  enthusiastic reception at our breakfast table, served with a light,
  flavorful grits pudding or spoon bread.  Grillades should be simmered long
  enough to be fork tender, refrigerated overnight, and reheated in the
  morning.  Make them with beef or veal, or try venison, which should be cut
  into julienne-size strips.
  
  Pound the pieces of meat to 1/4 inch thick.  In a Dutch oven or heavy pot
  heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and brown the meat well in batches, removing
  each batch to a warm plate.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and the
  flour to the pot.  Stir over medium heat for about 30 minutes to make a
  dark brown roux.
  
  Add the onion, green pepper, and garlic; saute for about 5 minutes, until
  soft, stirring often.  Add the tomatoes and thyme; cook, with stirring for
  3 minutes.  Add the broth and wine.  Stir well for several minutes,
  scraping up bits from the bottom of pan.  Return the meat to the pot and
  stir in the salt, bay leaf, Tabasco sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Lower
  the heat and simmer, covered, for 1-1/2 hours, or until the meat is very
  tender, stirring occasionally.
  
  Remove the bay leaf.  Stir in the parsley, cool, and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Reheat the grillades before serving, and serve with Cheese Grits (see
  recipe).

      Title: Tabasco Classic - Perfect Seared Steaks
 Categories: Beef, Meat, Peppers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    New York Strip Or:
           Rib Eye Steaks, 2" Thick
  2 2/3 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
           Freshly Cracked Black Pepper
           Salt
 
  This is our favorite way to cook steaks outdoors on a charcoal grill, and
  it works well with hamburgers, too.  Start with a good "steak fire" of
  white coals 3 to 4 inches below the grill.  To test the fire, put the palm
  of your hand just above the grill.  If you can keep it there only for as
  long as it takes to say "One thousand and one," the fire is ready.
  
  Place the steaks on a cutting board and, with the back of a spoon, briskly
  rub about 1/3 teaspoon Tabasco sauce and some pepper into both sides of
  each steak.  Grill the steaks over a hot fire for about 5 minutes on each
  side for medium-rare.
  
  To broil, preheat the broiler, place the seasoned steaks on an oiled
  broiler rack, and cook 6 inches from the heat for 4 to 5 minutes on each
  side for medium-rare.  Add salt to taste.

      Title: Tarragon Lamb
 Categories: Meat, Main dish, Marinades
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lb Leg of lamb
    2/3 c  Cream
      1 ts Tarragon
  1 1/4 c  Dry white wine
      1 tb Oil
      1 x  Salt and pepper to taste
      1 ea Onion sliced
 
  Skin  the  leg of lamb and trim away all the outside fat and as much of the
  fat lying between the muscle tissue that you can reach. Score the flesh
  deeply with a criss-cross pattern and stuff the slits with the tarragon.
  Rub the meat with the oil and cover with the onion. Place in a suitable
  dish for marinating and pour over the white wine. Add a little salt and
  pepper and leave to marinate for about 2 hours in a cool place, basting
  occasionally.  Roast the lamb with the marinade, basting it frequently, in
  a warm oven 325 deg F until done.
   About 10 minutes before the meat is cooked,  pour off the marinade and
  meat juices into a saucepan. Reduce the gravy to half its original quantity
  by  boiling vigorously. Carve the meat into thin slices and add the
  resulting juices to the marinade. Arrange the meat on a serving dish and
  keep warm.   Remove the gravy from the heat, stir in cream and carefully
  re- heat the sauce until it forms a medium-thick consistency. Pour the
  sauce over the lamb and keep warm.

      Title: Tender Jerky
 Categories: Makemeat, Game
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     10 lb Deer, elk, moose, etc.,
           -ground
    2/3 c  Curing sugar or curing salt
           -in a pinch
      1 ts Cardamom
      1 ts Marjoram
      1 tb MSG
  1 1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Black pepper
      3 tb Liquid smoke
      2 tb Water
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
 
  Begin preparation by deboning and removing the tendons and fat from the
  meat. It is important that you remove all fat or it will go rancid. Either
  grind the meat yourself or have someone grind it for you; a coarse grind
  gives the best results. Mix the spices thoroughly and then add the spices a
  bit at a time while kneading the meat like dough. Put the meat in the
  fridge for at least 6 hours to allow the spices to work through the meat.
  At this point you prepare the meat for jerking. If you have an electric
  meat slicer, make the meat into logs about 4 x 14"; place the meat in the
  fridge until it is solid but not frozen, and then slice 1/8" slices from
  end to end. You'll end up with a big stack of circular patties. If you
  don't have a slicer, roll the meat out to a 1/8" thickness between two
  pieces of wax paper. Remove the top paper and score the meat into strips
  and place them in the freezer for about 45 minutes. Remove the meat and
  break at the score marks. Place the jerky on wire racks and place them in a
  150 F. oven, leaving the door ajar so moisture can escape and the heat does
  not build up.  Turn the jerky once or twice during drying and rotate the
  racks if the jerky near the elements begins to dry too fast. Meat should be
  left slightly pliable, that should take somewhere around 3 or 4 hours to
  get to.  Cure yours to whatever point you like; if you like potato chips,
  be my guest. Jerky can can be stored for months in the freezer; the drier
  it is the longer it lasts. Makes 1 happy camper.

      Title: Tex-Mex Style Enchiladas
 Categories: Meat, Tex-mex
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Ground beef,
           -extra-lean (as
           -little fat as possible)
      2 md Onions, chopped
      4 tb Flour
  2 1/2 c  Enchilada sauce
           -(2 standard cans)
      1 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -sharp, grated
 
  PREPARE SAUCE AND FILLING:  Brown ground beef and 1 chopped onion in a
  large skillet. There should be enough fat in the beef to eliminate any need
  for extra oil and also to saute the onions at the same time. While you are
  browning the beef (it should be completely cooked with no pink or red color
  left), be sure to break it up so that it is granular in texture, as opposed
  to chunky, when completely browned. Onions should be limp and translucent
  but not brown.
  
  Add about 4 T  of flour and saute until flour is completely incorporated
  into the meat mixture. Add the enchilada sauce. Heat over low heat. If the
  mixture is too thick, add a little water.  The consistency should be that
  of a thick gravy, but not soupy. Simmer over low heat for 20-30 minutes.
  
  PREPARE ROLLED ENCHILADAS:  Rolled enchiladas are tougher to assemble, but
  more authentic.  Have ready a large baking pan, we always use an oblong
  Pyrex pan. One at a time, dip each tortilla in the enchilada sauce just
  enough to coat and slightly soften. Lay the tortilla flat in the baking
  pan, spoon about 3 T of the enchilada sauce in a line down the middle, top
  with about 1 t chopped onion and about 3 T of grated cheese.
  
  Roll the tortilla tightly into a cylinder with the seam on the bottom, and
  position against the bottom edge of the baking pan. Repeat until the pan is
  full. This can get tricky (but it is possible) as the pan gets full.
  Assembling the enchilada outside of the pan is usually a messy disaster.
  Depending on the size of the pan and how tightly each enchilada is rolled,
  you can get 8-12 enchiladas in a pan. This recipe should make about 16-24
  enchiladas.
  
  Spoon enchilada sauce over the assembled enchiladas to thinly cover.
  Sprinkle generously with grated cheese. Bake at 425 degrees F. for 20
  minutes.
  
  PREPARE STACKED ENCHILADAS:  This is the New Mexico style.  It is much
  easier to assemble. Have plates ready. One at a time, submerge each
  tortilla in the enchilada sauce (which should be cooking on low heat during
  this process) and cook until limp but not falling apart, this may take a
  little practice to gauge the time.
  
  Remove the tortilla from the sauce and place flat on a plate.  Spoon a
  little sauce, including meat, over the tortilla, add about 1 T chopped
  onion and about 4 T grated cheese. Repeat the process until you have a
  stack of 3-4 tortillas on a plate, depending on the appetite of the person
  who will eat them. Top the last tortilla with a generous amount of sauce
  and cheese. Serve immediately.
  
  The fundamental difference between these two styles is the method used to
  cook the tortillas. In the rolled style, the sauce is cooked into the
  tortilla through the baking process. In the stacked style, the tortilla is
  cooked directly in the sauce. Only the appearance differs, the taste is the
  same with either style.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Central Texas style Mexican enchiladas -- We cook beef enchiladas in two
  ways, the traditional rolled enchilada and the easier-to-cook New Mexico
  stacked style.  Both procedures are given.  Also, we used to cook the
  enchilada sauce/chili from scratch but more recently began using a shortcut
  with canned Old El Paso brand enchilada sauce, since it is not only faster
  (20 minutes vs. 4+ hours) but also has a very authentic spice combination.
  Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  I always use Old El Paso canned enchilada sauce, though it is possible
  to make your own.

      Title: Tex-Mex Style Tacos
 Categories: Meat, Tex-mex
      Yield: 12 Tacos
 
      2 lb Ground beef,
           -extra-lean
      1 md Onion, chopped fine
    1/2 ts Salt
      4 tb Chile powder
           -(or more to taste)
           Vegetable oil
     12    Corn tortillas (the
           -thinner the better)
    1/2 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -sharp, grated
      1 lg Tomato, chopped
      3 c  Shredded lettuce
 
  Brown the ground beef and chopped onion in a large skillet.  There should
  be enough fat in the beef to eliminate any need for extra oil and also to
  saute the onions at the same time. While you are browning the beef (it
  should be completely cooked with no pink or red color left), be sure to
  break it up so that it is granular in texture, as opposed to chunky, when
  completely browned. Onions should be limp and translucent but not brown.
  
  Drain off as much fat as possible.  Add salt and  chile powder and continue
  to saute until the chile is completely incorporated into the meat mixture.
  Cover skillet and leave on extremely low heat, just enough to keep the meat
  hot.
  
  Put about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a small skillet, and heat it. Test
  the oil for proper temperature by putting in a small piece of tortilla.
  When the oil reaches the temperature where it immediately begins to bubble
  frantically over the tortilla as soon as it is put in the oil and the
  tortilla piece becomes crisp quite quickly, you are ready to cook the taco
  shells.  This is important because there is nothing worse than a soggy taco
  shell (which results from the oil not being hot enough).
  
  Using tongs, put the tortillas in the oil, one at a time,  and cook for
  30-60 seconds until the underside just starts to become crisp. With the
  tongs, turn the tortilla over and, using a spatula, bend in half to form
  the shell. Cook each side of the bent tortilla until crisp, about 30-45
  seconds per side. Remove the shell from the oil and drain on a
  newspaper-covered cookie sheet. The cooked shells can be kept warm in the
  oven at very low heat.
  
  To assemble, fill each shell about 2/3s full of the meat and top with
  cheese, tomato and lettuce. We like to add extra zap with a shot of Tabasco
  sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  San Antonio, Texas style tacos -- My dad is from east Texas and my mom
  from southern Oklahoma, but they developed their definition of Tex-Mex from
  several years in San Antonio. Since they now live in D.C., they feel
  extremely deprived, none of the chain restaurants come anywhere near the
  taste they developed in San Antonio.
  
  Tex-Mex cooking is based on peasant-style dishes from the areas of Mexico
  bordering Texas.  The primary ingredients of Tex-Mex cooking are corn
  tortillas (the thinner the better), ground beef, pinto beans and hot chile
  powder, sharp Cheddar cheese and onions.  Yield:  1 dozen tacos.
  
  *  Don't try to use instant onion in this recipe.  In San Antonio, people
  consider that the best chile  powder is Gebhardt's or Eagle Brand.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

      1    Recipe Texas Barbecue Baste
           -(see recipe)
 
  Rub meat with salt and pepper.  If brisket is used, baste with barbecue
  sauce. Place meat in covered barbecue grill over coals. Cook slowly to
  allow smoke to permeate meat.  If sirloin is used it should be cooked for
  25 minutes.  If brisket is used, it should be cooked 2-2-1/2 hours, and
  should be basted frequently with sauce. Turn brisket once during cooking.
  Serves 4

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Beef rump roast, 3 to 3-1/2

      4 tb Beef suet or vegetable oil
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper to taste
      2 tb Butter
      4    Onions, sliced
    1/4 c  Water
      2 tb Cider vinegar
      1 ts Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Beer
      3 c  Brown soup stock (see topic
           3) or bouillon
      2    Ribs celery, cut in half
      2    Carrots, peeled and cut in
           Half
      2    Sprigs parsley
      2    Bay leaves
      1 ts Dried thyme
      2 tb Butter, at room temperature
      2 tb All-purpose flour
 
  In the late nineteenth and the early decades of our own time, many German
  families settled in the Ohio Valley around Louisville, and they brought
  their food and brewery talents with them. In many ways our food
  preferences reflect this influence. Most of our food today is lighter and
  fresher, but the old flavors linger on - one of which is this beef cooked
  in beer. Cook it ahead, heat it up, prepare some noodles and broccoli or
  kohrabi - it works like a charm.
  
  1. Have your butcher slice the roast into 12 to 14 slices.
  
  2. Melt the suet, if using, in a 400 degree oven while you flatten the
  slices of beef a bit with the flat side of a mallot. Then reduce the heat
  to 325 degrees.
  
  3. Heat the suet or vegetable oil in a large iron skillet over medium
  heat. Saute the slices of meat, a few at a time, in the fat until they
  have browned lightly on both sides. Be careful not to burn the fat. Season
  the meat with salt and pepper. Transfer the slices of meat as they brown
  to another pan to keep warm.
  
  4. Add 2 Tbsp. butter to the skillet and blend it with the brown
  crustiness from the beef. Add the onions and water. Cook until the onions
  absorb the butter and meat juices somewhat. Season with salt.
  
  5. Layer the meat and onions in a casserole or dutch oven, ending with a
  top layer of meat.
  
  6. Combine the vinegar, sugar, and beer in the skillet and deglaze over
  medium heat. Stir well and pour over the meat and onions.
  
  7. Add enough beef stock or bouillon to cover the meat well. If there is
  not enough, add some water. Add the celery, carrots, parsley, bay leaves,
  and thyme.
  
  8. Cover, and cook in the oven for 1-1/2 hours. Then blend together the
  softened butter and flour and whisk it into the meat juices. Season with
  salt and pepper to taste. Cover and continue to cook until the meat is
  exquisitely tender and the juices have thickened. This may take another 30
  minutes, depending upon the quality of the meat. Discard the seasoning
  vegetables and herbs.

 Categories: Penndutch, Preserving, Makemeat, Pork
      Yield: 100 Pounds
 
    100 lb Ham
      1 pt Salt, kosher
      1 x  *also:
    1/8 lb Pepper
      3 oz Salt peter
    1/2 lb Brown sugar
      2 pt Salt
 
  *** The "recipe" specifies ham from corn-fed hogs, and "fine salt (best
  quality)". Since kosher salt is commonly available today, and contains no
  iodine, I changed the ingredients to specify it.
  Mix thoroughly the salt peter, 1 pint salt and brown sugar and rub over the
  hams and let stand for 24 hours. Then rub the meat with the pepper and part
  of the remaining salt. Let stand for 5 days and then rub meat again with
  fine salt. Set aside for 30 days, hang the meat up and brush off the salt.
  Have hams smoked at a good smoke house, smoking them for 10 days with wood.
  When finished, rub entire ham with red pepper, wrap carefully in brown
  paper and then in muslin bags and hang up with the hock down. Hams prepared
  in this manner will keep indefinitely, and flavor and quality improve with
  time.

  adding more water if mixture dries out.  Halfway through cooking time,
  season with salt to taste.  Stir in rolled oats and cook, stirring, for 1
  to 2 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.
  
  Meanwhile, line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry.  When meat mixture is
  lukewarm, spoon into pie shell and cover with remaining pastry. Trim
  pastry, seal edges and cut steam vents in top crust.  Decorate with pastry
  cutouts as desired.  Bake in preheated 425 deg F oven for 15 minutes, then
  reduce heat to 375 deg F and bake another 25 minutes or until crust is

  layers until the rib is completely layered and is now one long strip. Using
  the edge of a Chinese knife or otehr flat surface, pound meat until it is
  off an even thickness. NOTE: Chill the meat well. This cutting method will
  not work well on room temperature ribs. MARINADE: (Curry Based Blender
  Sauce) Blend all liquid ingredients in a blender for about 15 seconds at
  "Blend" speed. Grate the fresh ginger root and combine with the minced
  garlic. Mince the white (only) portion of the green onions. Add all
  ingredients to blender mixture and operate on "low" for about 45 seconds.
  Rub suace onto butterflied ribs and refridgerate for 2 or more hours. NOTE:
  This sauce is excellent for chicken, too. Place ribs on grill, basting
  often with sauce until done, about 30 minutes depending on heat of grill.
  Watch carefully to determine when done.

      Title: Upper Michigan Pasties
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Shortening
    1/4 c  Lard
    1/4 c  Scraped suet
           Water

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
  1 1/4 lb Beef, coarsely ground
      4 md Potatoes, diced
      1 lg Onion, chopped
    1/4 c  Rutabaga (swede), diced
      1    Carrot, diced
           Salt and pepper
 
  Put the flour in a bowl and cut in the shortening, lard and suet. Add just
  enough water to make a soft dough.  Divide the dough into four parts and
  roll out each piece into a circle about the size of a dinner plate.
  
  Crumble the meat into a bowl and stir in the potatoes, onion, rutabaga and
  carrot.  Divide the mixture into four parts, putting some on one side of
  each piece of dough. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.
  
  Fold the pastry over the filling to make half-moon shaped pies.  Seal the
  edges and cut a couple of small slits on the top.  Bake on a cookie sheet
  at 375 degrees F. for 30 to 35 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F.
  and bake 15 more minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cornish-style meat pies from the UP -- The pasty (PAH-stee) is a kind of
  English meat pie.  It was brought to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan by
  Cornish miners in the mid-nineteenth century.  The UP version differs
  slightly from the original Cornish pasty in that it has more vegetables and
  less meat and crust.
  
  You can eat pasties hot, warm, or cold.  If you wrap them in aluminum foil
  when they come out of the oven, they'll keep warm for hours. Or, you can
  refrigerate/freeze them and reheat them later.  (Maybe the original "fast
  food?")
  
  *  Most people who live in the UP don't bother to make their own pasties;
  they buy them from bakeries and pasty shops (which are as common as
  hamburger joints are in other parts of the country). As a former resident,
  though, sometimes I get homesick and resort to making them myself. This is
  the recipe my mother sent me.
  
  *  These have a high cholesterol content.  I've tried using an ordinary
  vegetable-shortening pie crust, but it invariably turns out too dry and
  crumbly to hold together.  (Authentic UP pasties have a crust that's thin,
  moist, and somewhat chewy, not a flaky crust.)  If anyone has any ideas,
  I'd love to hear about them. You can also cook the filling by itself in a
  casserole dish if you're feeling lazy about making the crust.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the crust ingredients.

 Categories: Meat, European
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Veal cutlets
           Flour
           Salt & pepper
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Olive oil
      4    Mushrooms, fresh, sliced
    1/2 c  Marsala wine
      4 tb Butter, cold
           Provolone cheese, sliced
 
  Pound veal cutlets between sheets of waxed paper til about 1/4" thick.
   Combine flour and salt & papper to taste.  Dredge cutlets in the flour
  mixture.  Combine 2 Tbsp butter with the 2 Tbsp olive oil in a large frying
  pan over medium high heat.  Cook cutlets until lightly browned- about 2-3
  minutes per side.  Remove cutlets to a platter or pan suitable for use
  under a broiler.  Place sliced mushrooms in the frying pan and cook until
  tender, adding a little butter if needed. Add Marsala and reduce sauce to
  about half of the original volume. Pre-heat broiler. Lower heat under the
  frying pan to VERY low, or place pan in a larger pan of hot water. Whisk in
  cold butter, 1 Tbsp at a time, adding each just before the last is
  completely incorporated. Remove sauce from heat immediately when done.
  Place a slice of provolone on each cutlet and broil until cheese bubbles
  and just starts to brown. Serve sauce alongside the cutlets, or spoon over
  as they are served.  (This type of sauce will separate if it becomes too
  hot at any point- mine always does :) ).
  
  Other ideas:  Use chicken in place of veal.  Place a slice of prosciutto on
  the chicken or veal, then the slice of cheese before broiling.

      Title: Veal Scaloppine with Marsala
 Categories: European, Meat
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Scallopine of veal, cut
           Into 1/4 inch slices
           Flour for dredging
           Salt
           Freshly ground Pepper
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 c  Marsala wine
 
  Unless the scaloppine are very small, cut them into pieces measuring ab. 3
  in. by 3 in or slightly larger.  Place them between sheets of wax paper and
  pound lightly to flatten.(use a rolling pin, bottom of a heavy skillet,
  pounder, etc.) Blend flour with salt and pepper to taste. Dip the meat into
  flour to coat lightly. Using a large, heavy skillet, heat the butter and
  oil and when it is very hot but not brown, add the meat in one layer. Cook
  over relatively high heat until golden brown on one side. Turn and cook
  until golden brown on the other. The cooking time should be from 4-6 min.
  Transfer meat to a serving platter or two plates and keep warm. To the
  skillet add the wine and stir to dissolve the particles in the pan. Reduce
  wine slightly and pour equal amounts over each serving. Naturally, these
  amts. may be increased to serve more people. For Chicken marsala, I don't
  see why you can't substitute chicken breasts.

      Title: White Osso Bucco
 Categories: Meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 sl Veal shank, each about
           -1 1/2 - 2 inches thick
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/3 c  Butter, unsalted
      3 c  White wine, dry
           -(or less)
      1    Lemon
      8 tb Parsley (fresh),
           -chopped fine
           Flour, salt and pepper
 
  Dredge the veal shank pieces well in flour.  In a large skillet with high
  sides, heat the olive oil and butter over moderately high heat until the
  butter stops foaming.  If you do not have a skillet large enough to
  accommodate all of the meat in a single layer, use two smaller pans.
  
  Add the veal shanks to the skillet and arrange in a single layer. Cook over
  moderately high heat until browned on one side. Add a generous amount of
  salt and pepper. Turn meat and brown the other side, and add salt and
  pepper.
  
  Add enough white wine to nearly, but not quite, cover the meat. Reduce heat
  to a barely bubbling simmer. Cover with a well-fitting lid. Cook at a
  simmer for 2 1/2 hours.
  
  Peel a thin layer of rind from the lemon.  (I find that a vegetable peeler
  gives me a nice thin layer of rind.)  Cut rind into fine strips.
  
  Remove veal shanks to a warm plate.  The meat will be falling-off-the-bone
  tender, so a wide spatula is advised for this step to keep each shank
  intact. Keep meat warm through the next several steps.
  
  Add lemon peel and chopped parsley to the sauce and place over high heat.
  Boil vigorously for several minutes to reduce sauce slightly. Stir to
  loosen any brown bits from the pan and then frequently to prevent burning.
  
  Remove from heat and return shanks to skillet.  Spoon sauce over shanks and
  replace skillet lid.  Let sit for 3-5 minutes to reheat shanks. Serve with
  sauce over shanks.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Braised veal shanks in white wine -- This recipe is adapted from
  Marcella Hazan's "More Classic Italian Cooking." Simple to make, this dish
  beats any "traditional" osso bucco with tomatoes and vegetables that I've
  had in the U.S. or Italy.
  
  *  Veal shanks are a relatively inexpensive cut of meat.  If possible, ask
  your butcher to use hind shanks which have more meat than do the forelegs.
  The key to this dish is the quality of the ingredients. I use the best
  olive oil (Italian, virgin first-press, cold-press) and table quality dry
  white wine (fume or sauvignon blanc) I can find at a reasonable price.
  
  *  For dredging, rather than using a plate of flour, I put about 2/3 cup
  flour in a plastic bag, put in the shanks one at a time, and shake to
  thoroughly cover all sides of the meat with flour.
  
  *  The flavor of the dish is light so I usually serve with a home-made
  pasta dish with a cream-based sauce and a steamed green vegetable. Be sure
  to have plenty of crusty bread on hand to soak up the sauce. For those who
  like the marrow, don't forget to spoon it out of the shanks.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: Wyoming Polish Sausage, Salami and Smoked Venison
 Categories: Makemeat, Game, Ethnic
      Yield: 35 Pounds
 
 
  Take 17  pounds of lean, fat-free venison and 17  pounds of lean, fresh
  pork.  Your mixture has to be this half-and-half mixture to be reallly
  good. (It will be dry without the pork.) Grind up the meaats and mix them
  together thoroughlly.  Mix in 4 oz. of water.
  
  Now mix in 1 1/2 oz.  of black pepper, one oz. of ginger, 1 1/2 oz. of
  nutmeg, 1/2 oz. of allspice, 1/2 oz. paprika, 2 level ts. of garlic
  powdeer, (if you do not like garlic, substitute 4 level ts. of onion
  powder), 12 oz. of salt and
      1/2    pound of dried milk.
  
  If you do not want to go to the trouble of making the meat into sausages,
  simply wrap it in opound packages in aluminum foil and freeze it for safe
  keeping.  To use it ssimply make upp into patties and fry like hamburger or
  hamburger steak.  It is delicious.
  
  To make up into ssausages you can do it in ttwo different ways, depending
  on where you have smoking equipment or ot.  Either method is equally good.
  
  1. If you do not have smoking equipment proceed as follows.
  
  Mix in 3 level ts. of liquid smoke (Check the instructions on the liquid
  smoke bottle as the amount necessary to use varies from brand to brand.
  Herter's French-Canadian Liquid Smoke is best.)
  
  Stuff the meat in casings if you have them.  Keep the links about 6-8
  inches long.  If you have no casings, simply make the meat iinto patties.
  This workds just as well.
  
  Smoking is just a baking process.  Put what you will use for 2 weeks in
  your refrigerator.  Wrap the balance iin aluminum foil and freeze.
  
  2.  If you have smoking equiipment proceed as follows.
  
  Stuff the meaat in casing if you have them.  Keep the links about 6-8
  inches long.  Keep the links connected until they are dry.  If you do not
  have casings, make up the meat into patties and place them on metal trays
  or wiire screen that will go in your smokehousse or smoker. Smoke over a
  low maple, apple, messquiite or hickory wood fire from 4-6 hours. Keep the
  fire low at about 120 degrees.  This is not hot enough to cause much
  dripping or shrinking.
  
  Remove and put a two week's supply in your refrigerator.  Wrap the balance
  in aluminum foil and freeze at once.
  
  To cook, put the patties or sausages in a frying pan and add enough water
  to cover up 1/3 of the way on them.  Put a cover on the fryingpan and boil
  for 15 minutes.  Remove, pourout the water from the frying pan and then put
  the patties or sausages back into the frying pan and brown them slightly on
  all sides.  Makes wonderful eating.
