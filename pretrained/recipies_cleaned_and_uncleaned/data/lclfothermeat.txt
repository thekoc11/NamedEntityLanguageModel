Lean Cooking Tips For Beef

low cal, low fat, beef, hints

1  see below

1. Select lean cuts of beef. 2. Choose closely trimmed CHOICE or
SELECT grade beef cuts. 3. Trim any visable fat from meat before
cooking, and trim inside separable fat after cooking, but before
eating. Research shows that when beef is cooked with outside fat on,
some of the fat liquifies and migrates to the meat. On the average an
additional 9 percent reduction in fat can be achieved by trimming
before cooking. 4. Use cooking methods which do not require
additional fat (non-stick skillets, broiling, roasting on a rack,
grilling and ETC. 5. Reduce oil called for in marinades to 1 teaspoon
per 1/2 cup marinade or eliminate completely.
