 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    250 g  Sweet flan pastry
           Butter and flour for the
           - tart tin

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      3 x  Eggs
      1 x  Egg yolk
      1 x  Juice of 3 lemons
      1 x  Juice of 1 orange
  1 1/2 dl Double cream
    150 g  Sugar
 
  Pre-heat the oven to 260 oC (500 oF).
  
  Butter and lightly flour a 20 cm tart tin with a removable base. Line
  it with the pastry and blind-bake it for 10-15 minutes. Take care to
  protect the pastry with a disc of aluminium foil, which should be
  pressed up to and over the edges before it is weighted down. When
  itis cooked, let it cool without taking it out of the tin. Lower the
  oven temperature to 180 oC (350 oF).
  
  Whisk all the ingredients for the tart filling together - the eggs,
  orange and lemon juice, cream and sugar.
  
  When the mixture is nice and frothy, pour most of it into the tart
  shell. The mixture needs to come right to the top, but to avoid
  spilling it put the partly filled tart into the oven (with the
  temperature now reduced) and finish filling it with a spoon.
  
  Bake the tart with the oven door ajar, and wait until the filling has
  become firm. This should take about 35 minutes. Check the firmness of
  the filling by giving the tin a little shake.
  
  Take the tart out of the tin when it is lukewarm and leave it on a
  cake rack to cool.

      Title: LEMON TARTLETS (EW)
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------LEMON CURD------------------------------
      1    Large egg
      2    Large egg whites
    3/4 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Fresh lemon juice (4 lemons)
      1 tb Grated lemon zest
      2 tb Butter

MMMMM-----------------------PASTRY SHELLS----------------------------
      2 tb Vegetable oil, preferably
           -canola oil
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  All-purpose white flour
      2    Large eggs
      4    Large egg whites
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract
           Confectioners' sugar for
           -dusting
 
  To make lemon curd:  Whisk together egg, egg whites, sugar, lemon
  juice and zest in a heavy bottomed, medium-sided saucepan. If you do
  not have a heavy-bottomed pan, use a double boiler and increase the
  cooking time slightly.  Add butter and cook over medium-low heat,
  whisking constantly, until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. (The curd will
  become thicker as it cools.)  Transfer to bowl and let cool.  Cover
  and refrigerate until chilled.  (The curd can be prepared ahead and
  stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.)
  
  To make pastry shells:  Place oven rack in the upper third of the
  oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Lightly oil 24 three-inch muffin cups
  or spray them with nonstick cooking spray.
  
  in a medium-size saucepan, combine 1 cup water, oil, sugar and salt;
  bring just to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat and add
  flour all at once.  Stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms
  a smooth mass. Let cool for 2 minutes, then transfer to a stand-up
  mixer fitted with paddle attachment or to a food processor.
  
  In a measuring cup, whisk together eggs, egg whites and vanilla.
  Gradually add one quarter of the egg mixture to the flour paste,
  beating or processing until the eggs are incorporated. Repeat with 3
  more additions of the egg mixture until the batter just falls from a
  spoon. The batter may seem lumpy.
  
  Place aobut 1 T pastry into each prepared muffin cup. Dip a spoon in
  cold water and press the pastry into sides of the cups. With
  moistened fingers, press the pastry part way up the sides of the
  cups, forming 3/8 inch thick shells.  Bake for 5 minutes.  Remove
  from the oven and prick the centers of the shells with a fork. Return
  to the oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until puffed and
  golden. Loosen shells with a table knife or small metal spatula and
  transfer to a wire rack. Let cool. (The shells can be prepared ahead
  and stored, well wrapped, in the freezer for up to 1 month.  Unwrap
  and thaw at room temp. for 1 hour before filling).
  
  To assemble tartlets:  Not more than 1 1/2 hours before serving, spoon
  about 1 T lemon curd into each tartlet shell and dust with
  confectioners' sugar.
  
  Makes 24 tartlets, serves 12.

      Title: LEMON TOFU "CHEESECAKE"
 Categories: Desserts, Vegetarian, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
      2 c  Grape-Nuts cereal
    1/4 c  Maple syrup
    1/4 ts Almond extract

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lb Silken tofu, drained (it
           -will say silken on the
           -container)
    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Tahini
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Lemon zest
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Almond extract
      2 tb Cornstart dissolved in 2
           -tb rice or soy milk
 
  Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place cereal in a food
  processor or blender; grind to fine crumbs, about 2 minutes. Transfer
  to mixing bowl. Add maple syrup and almond extract; mix well until
  crumbs are moistened.
  
  Pour into oiled 9-inch pie plate and press mixture evenly on bottom
  and up sides to form crust.  Bake 5 minutes; let cool while preparing
  filling.
  
  Filling:  Blend all ingredients in food processor or blender until
  very smooth, about 30 seconds.
  
  Pour into crust.  Bake until top of pie is slightly browned, about 30
  minutes.  Cool and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled and firm,
  about 2 hours.  Makes 8 servings.
  
  Variations:
     *Alternatively, use a prepared graham cracker crust.
     *For a no-bake cheesecake, omit cornstarch mixture. Pour
      filling into crust and refrigerate until firm, at least 2
      hours or overnight.  The texture will resemble that of a
      cream pie.
     *Add vanilla-flavored liqueur instead of lemon juice and zest
      for a vanilla cheesecake.
     *Reduce the sweetener, eliminated the lemon juice and zest,
      and add pureed raspberries
     *If the fat content doesn't concern you too much, add 12
      ounces of melted semisweet chocolate instead of fruit.
     *To serve as a pudding, omit the crust and pour the filling
      into custard cups.

     12 oz Evaporated milk (not skim)
      4 tb Butter
      1 tb Lemon zest; grated
      3 tb Lemon juice
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Walnuts; chopped
 
  Combine the sugar, cocoa and salt in a large, heavy bottom saucepan.
  Stir to mix and break up any lumps of cocoa powder. Add the corn
  syrup, milk and 2 tablespoons of the butter.
  
  Place over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the
  mixture comes to a boil.  Stop stirring; cover the pan with a
  tight-fitting lid for about a minute to steam off any sugar crystals
  on the sides of the pan. Watch closely so the fudge does not boil
  over.
  
  Uncover and continue to cook (without stirring), swabbing down the
  sides of the pan from time to time with a pastry brush dipped in
  water, until the temperature reaches the soft-ball stage.
  
  Use a candy thermometer, or the old-fashioned method of dropping a
  bit of the hot candy into a cup of cold water every so often. When it
  forms a cohesive puddle on the bottom of the cup and can be formed
  into a ball that flattens when lifted out of the water, that's
  "soft-ball" stage.) Immediately swab down the sides of the pan. Pour
  (do not scrape) the fudge onto a slab of marble or a large platter or
  into a flat baking dish.
  
  Heat the lemon zest, juice, and vanilla to boiling and pour over the
  hot candy.  Top with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Let the
  mixture cool to room temperature without disturbing it. Stir the
  fudge with a spatula or plastic scraper until it becomes thick and
  starts to lose its gloss. This is the exercise part...feel the
  burn....it takes a while! Add the chopped nuts just as the fudge
  becomes too stiff to stir.
  
  Spread the fudge onto a buttered plate or sheet of plastic wrap.
  After a few minutes, it will solidify and you can wrap and store it
  for several days--even weeks if you keep it a secret! Yields 2-1/8
  lbs.

    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  1. Sprinkle yeast and 1/2 tsp of the sugar over very warm water in a
  1 cup measure.  Stir to dissolve yeast. Let stand until bubbly, about
  10 minutes. 2. Combine 2 cups of the flour, salt, lemon rind and the
  remaining sugar in a large bowl; make a well in the middle. Beat eggs
  and egg yolks in a small bowl just to mix. Pour eggs, yeast mixture
  and warm milk into well. Stir liquids into flour until smooth. Beat
  well. 3. Add softened butter gradually, beating well.  Stir in 1 more
  cup of the flour. Beat until dough leaves the side of the bowl. 4.
  Knead on a lightly floured surface; until smooth and elastic, about 8
  minutes. 5. Press dough into a buttered large bowl, turn to bring
  buttered side up; cover. Let rise in a warm place, 1 1/2 to 2 hours,
  or until doubled in volume. 6. While the dough is rising, make Cheese

  electric mixer until smooth; beat in egg yolk and sugar. Stir in
  lemon rind. 7. Make Crumb Topping: Combine nuts, flour, butter, sugar
  and cinnamon in a small bowl. Grease two 8 x 1 1/2 inch pans. 8. When
  dough has doubled, punch down, knead in raisins; divide dough into
  four equal parts; press two parts into the bottoms and about 1/2 inch
  up the sides of the prepared pans; spread each with about 1 cup of
  the cheese filling. 9. Shape remaining dough into 2 8-inch circles;
  place on top of cheese filling. Press the handle of a spoon into
  dough around edges to seal. 10. Sprinkle half the crumb topping over
  each. Let rise in a warm place until dough reaches the top of the
  pans, about 1 hour. 11. Bake in a preheated 350 F degree oven for 40
  minutes; or until the cakes sound hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire
  rack. (Place foil loosely over the crumb topping; invert onto rack,
  then turn right side up.) Let cool at least 30 minutes before
  serving. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.

      Title: LEMON-COCONUT WAFERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 80 Servings
 
  1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 tb Grated lemon zest
    1/2 c  Sugar
      8 tb (1 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
      2 c  All-purpose or pastry flour
    1/3 c  Unsweetened coconut, grated
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/8 ts Salt
 
  "These delicate crackers never fail to attract a crowd. Fresh lemon
  zest is the secret to their popularity. Perfect party fare or dessert
  crackers, these treats are not too sweet, and they go well with a
  fresh pot of tea in the afternoon. You will bake these crackers again
  and again. 325~F. 12 to 15 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  To prepare the zest, lightly grate the outer peel of the lemon
  against the fine grate of a cheese grater. Use only the colored part
  of the rind; the underlying white portion is bitter. You should have
  about 1/2 Tablespoon zest for this recipe. Squeeze the lemon for its
  juice; you should have about 1-1/2 Tablespoons.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, cream the butter and sugar
  together. Add the egg, the lemon juice, and the lemon zest. In another
  bowl, combine the flour, coconut, baking powder, and salt.
  
  Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and blend to form a dough
  that will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2
  portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll
  thin, at most 1/8 inch. Cut out individual crackers about 2 inches
  across with a cookie cutter, juice can, or knife and arrange on a
  lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
  
  Prick each cracker all the way through 2 or 3 times with the tines of
  a fork. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn the crackers over and bake another
  2 to 5 minutes, depending on the thickness, or until just very
  lightly browned. Cool the crackers on a rack. Yield: 75-80.
  
  VARIATIONS: Try substituting orange zest and orange juice for the
  lemon. If absolutely necessary, you can substitute dried ground lemon
  peel. The result will not be as fresh and tasty, however.

  forming. Refrigerate until chilled, about 6 hours. (Can be prepared 2
  days ahead.)

  sifting.
  
  Stir chocolate and 1/2 cup cream in heavy medium saucepan over low
  heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. mix in remaining
  1/2 cup cream, milk and vanilla.

  alternately with white chocolate mixture, beginning and ending with
  dry ingredients. Using electric mixer fitted with clean dry beaters,
  beat egg whites in medium bowl to soft peaks. Gradually beat in
  remaining 1 cup sugar. Continue beating until stiff but not dry. Fold
  whites into cake batter in 2 additions. Divide batter among prepared
  cake pans. Bake until tester inserted in center comes out clean and
  cakes are beginning to pull away from sides of pans, about 24
  minutes. Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes. Turn cakes out onto
  racks, peel off waxed paper and cool completely. (Can be prepared 4
  hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.)

  peaks form.  Place 1 cake layer on platter. Spread 2/3 cup lemon curd
  evenly atop cake layer. Spread 3/4 cup frosting atop curd. Top with
  second cake layer. Spread cake with 2/3 cup curd, then with 3/4 cup
  frosting. Top with third cake layer. Frost top and sides of entire
  cake evenly with 3 cups frosting.

  preheat the oven to 375F. Grease several baking sheets. Working in
  batches, by rounded tablespoonfuls, measure out the chilled dough and
  form it into 1-inch balls. Place the balls of dough on the baking
  sheets, spacing them well apart. Use the remaining flour to coat the
  flat bottom of a glass or measuring cup. Flatten the balls into
  2-inch rounds about 1/4-inch thic, reflouring the glass a necessary.

      Title: LEMON-OIL FURNITURE POLISH
 Categories: Household, Better
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------CHEAPER AND BETTER--------------------------
      1 c  Mineral oil
      1 ts Lemon oil

MMMMM----------------------MAKE IT YOURSELF---------------------------
      1 pt Mineral oil aka paraffin oil
      2 ts Oil of lemon
 
  ** This polish is every bit as effective as the purchased product,
  and it should be used sparingly to best effect. Too much polish, wax,
  or oil on your furniture will only trap more dust, so work harder to
  buff this solution off than to pour it on.
  
  Pour into the clean container of your choice. Close tightly, label
  and keep out of the reach of children.
  
  To Use: If you like to spray-and-polish, store this solution in a
  pump-type container. If you like to rub your furniture quietly, store
  the solution in a squeeze-type container and apply it to an old sock
  that you've slipped over your hand, then rub away. In either case,
  use only a little bit of the polish at a time and then buff the
  surface with a clean cloth or sock. 8 oz
  
  Gift note from me: Include a man's white tube sock with lace and/or a
  ribboned bow to use for a cleaning cloth.

      Title: LEMON-ROASTED SALMON WITH CREAMY DILL SAUCE
 Categories: Fish*shell, Main dish
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      5 lb Salmon, cleaned [1 fish]
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      3    Lemons, sliced
    1/2 c  Fresh dill
    1/2 c  Fresh parsley sprigs
      2 tb Butter, melted

MMMMM-------------------CREAMY DILL WINE SAUCE------------------------
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Fresh dill, chopped
 
  Buying Tip: When buying fresh fish, flesh should be firm, spring back
  when touched and smell fresh. Fish should have unclouded eyes and
  bright red gills. To determine thickness of fish, use a ruler, placed
  perpendicular to the backbone, and a flat edge across the side of the
  fish, at right angle to the ruler. Read ruler where the two intersect.
  
  1. Let salmon stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Using sharp
  chef's knife, firmly cut off fish head behind gills (or have
  fishmonger remove it). Rinse under cold water; pat dry. Season inside
  and out with salt and pepper. Line baking sheet with foil; arrange
  one-third of the lemon slices in lengthwise row along centre. Top
  with salmon.
  
  2. Fill body cavity with dill, parsley and another third of the
  lemons. Brush butter over salmon; top with remaining lemons. Measure
  thickest part of salmon; calculate 12-15 minutes cooking time for
  every 1 inch of thickness. Crumple up foil around fish to hold
  juices, leaving salmon uncovered.
  
  3. Bake salmon in 450F 230C oven for about 45 minutes or until flesh
  at thickest part is opaque and flakes easily when tested with fork.
  Remove from oven and tent with foil; let stand for 5 minutes. With
  baster or spoon, remove 1/4 cup pan juices; set aside.
  
  4. Creamy Dill Wine Sauce: In saucepan, melt butter over medium heat;
  stir in flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in
  milk, wine, cream, salt and pepper; cook, whisking, for 5 minutes or
  until boiling and thickened. Stir in reserved pan juices; reduce heat
  and simmer for 5 minutes. Keep warm over low heat while carving
  salmon; stir in dill.
  
  5. to serve salmon, discard lemon on top. cut lengthwise along
  backbone through to bone. Starting at backbone, gently pull off skin;
  discard. Cut along midline (This is the natural fold between the back
  flesh and the flesh on the rib bones.) parallel to backbone, through
  to bone. Cut crosswise into 4-inch wide portions. Insert spatula
  between meat and bones, lift salmon portions to warmed serving plates.
  
  6. Gently lift exposed bones away from the other side of salmon;
  discard. Repeat cutting along midline as in Step 5, then into
  portions; ease salmon away from skin. Serve with warm sauce.

      Title: LEMON-ROSEMARY RUB
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 ts Grated lemon peel
      1 ts Crushed dry rosemary leaves
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Dried thyme leaves
    1/4 ts Coarse ground black pepper
      2 lg Garlic cloves -- minced
 
  Combine all ingredients.  Use to season tender beef
       steaks or roasts such as: sirloin, T-bone,
                   Porterhouse, tenderloin, rib eye, and top loin. This
  recipe makes enough rub to season 2 pounds of beef.
  
  Comments:  Rubs are applied to the exterior surface of the meat just
  before grilling; they need no
  :            standing time. However, for convenience, rubs may be
  applied several hours in advance; the coated meat should be
  refrigerated until grilling time. Flavors become more pronounced the
  longer the rub is on the meat. You can create your own blend of
  seasonings for rubs or use a commercial blend. Recipe Source: GREAT

MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
  2 1/2 ts Yeast
  1 7/8 c  Bread flour
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
    1/2 tb Salt
  1 1/2 tb Oil
    1/4 c  Lemonade concentrate; thawed
      1 c  Water; warm
 
  Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
  order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
  push Start.
  
  In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.
  
  Sweet but not cloying and slightly tart, this is good beach food or
  porch food.  If you slice and wrap the bread in your beach towel
  before you leave home, there will be no paper or plastic wrapper to
  add to the trash on the beach.  Just shake out the crumbs before you
  dry off.

      Title: LEMONGRASS CHICKEN
 Categories: Thai, Asian, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Frying Chicken
           Hacked into serving pieces
           --MARINADE--
    1/2 c  Lemongrass--See Note
      3    Scallion finely mince
           Green and white parts
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black Pepper
           --STIR-FRY--
      2 tb Peanut Oil
      2 sm Chili Peppers-small red
      2 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Chicken Stock
           --GARNISHES--
    1/2 c  Peanuts
      2 tb Nuoc Mam-Fish sauce
           --See Note
      2 tb Coriander leaves
 
  NOTES: A. Lemongrass, Remove outer leaves of the lemongrass and finely
  slice the tender white part at the base of the stalk. Bruise on the
  cutting board with a large morter and pestle or handle of a cleaver,
  or a wine bottle. Of course a cuisinart with a 1mm slicer will do the
  same thing but sometimes smashing is good. B. Fish Sauce, Nuoc Mam
  brand name is Tiparos from Thailand. Fish sauce can be from Vietnam
  or Cambodia and should be tasted to determine the saltiness and the
  taste. Some of the fish sauce is cloudy and unfiltered, I would avoid
  such products. The best fish sauce is tea colored and semi-clear to
  coffee colored. METHOD: Mix the chicken pieces with the salt, pepper,
  lemongrass and scallions. Set aside for at least 30 minutes, overnite
  is better. Heat the Wok, add the oil, when the oil is hot add the
  chicken pieces, stir and cook for 3 or more minutes. Add the chili
  peppers and stir and cook over medium heat until chicken no longer

      Title: LEMONGRASS CHICKEN WIP
 Categories: Thai, Asian, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Frying Chicken
           -cut into serving pieces
           --MARINADE--
    1/2 c  Lemongrass; seenote
      3    Scallion; finely minced
           -Green and white parts
      1 tb Nuoc Mam; seenote
  1 1/2 tb Vinegar; mild or rice
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black Pepper
           --STIR-FRY--
      2 tb Peanut Oil
      2 sm Chili Peppers-small red
           -or green Thai peppers
      2 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Chicken Stock
           --GARNISHES--
           Sections of banana blossom
    1/2 c  Bean Sprouts; rinsed
      1 bn Chinese Chives; Onion chives
           - cut into 2" pieces
    1/2 c  Peanuts; chopped small
      2 tb Or more; Fish Sauce
           -Nuoc Mam or Nam Pla seenote
      2 tb Coriander leaves;chopped
 
  Notes: A. Lemongrass, Remove outer leaves of the lemongrass and
  bruise or smash the white end with the back of the knife or a wine
  bottle. Finely slice the tender white part at the base of the stalk,
  discard the tops or save for your chicken stock. A cuisinart with a
  1mm slicer will slice it just as well but sometimes smashing is good.
   B. Fish Sauce, Nuoc Mam  or Nam Pla. A good brand name is "Tiparos"
  from Thailand.
   METHOD: Mix the chicken pieces with the lemongrass, scallions,
  vinegar, Nuoc Mam salt and pepper. Set aside for at least 30 minutes,
  overnite is better. If the lemongrass is cut too thick you will have
  to remove the slices of lemongrass before you put it in the wok, if
  it is cut very thin it will cook well enough to eat it.
   Heat the Wok, add the oil, when the oil is hot add the chiles and the
  chicken pieces, stir and cook for 3 or more minutes. Stir and cook
  over medium heat until chicken no longer looks pink. Season with
  sugar and green chiles or white pepper. Add the chicken stock, toss
  over high heat to reduce fluid, and  to cook the chicken. Thicken if
  required. Serve in an oval shallow casserole.
   GARNISHES: Garnish with Nuoc Mam, Peanuts, quartered or sliced banana
  blossom, bean sprouts, powdered chile powder, sliced green chiles, and
  Coriander.

      Title: LEMONGRASS PRIMER
 Categories: Ethnic, Relishes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Lemongrass
 
  Though common throughout southeast Asia, lemongrass is featured most
  prominently in the cuisine of Thailand, where it may be found growing
  in practically every house. It contains citral, the same substance
  found in the zest of a lemon, and 1 T of chopped fresh lemongrass has
  about the same "sour power" as an equal amount of minced lemon peel.
  Fresh lemongrass is increasingly available at Asian markets
  throughout the United States. It is easy to grow your own, either in
  the garden or as a houseplant. Stand a stalk in water until it starts
  sending out roots, pot it and place the plant in a sunny spot.    The
  entire stalk is useful. Aside from the instructions of specific
  recipes, cut a 6" section off the root end, remove the outer few
  layers from this lower part, chop the inner fiber and saute to make a
  crisp topping for chicken or to put into salads and sauces. The
  tougher outer layers can be chopped and added to marinades for
  chicken or pork, or mashed and brewed for tea. The top of the stalk
  can be bundled and added to stock or used as a flavoring for hot and
  sour soup. Condensed from Bon Appetit, June,1992. Mail order sources
  given are Tommy Tang and Dean & DeLuca. For information on Thai

      4    Thin slices whole-grain
           -bread
    1/4 c  Anchovy spread (recipe

      1 c  Caesar Dressing (recipe
           -follows)
      4 oz Parmesan cheese in one piece
 
  Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins characterize this inventive, egg-free
  recipe from "The New Basics" (Workman, 1989) as "a lovely, light
  version of the classic".  They suggest tucking the walnut toast under
  a couple of big, crisp leaves of romaine, so it's a surprise.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a small skillet.  Add the walnuts and saute over
  medium heat until lightly toasted, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside. Toast
  the bread; then spread each slice with Anchovy Spread and scatter
  with the toasted walnuts
  
  Tear the lettuce into pieces and toss with the dressing. Place a
  piece of prepared toast on each plate and top with a portion of the
  lettuce and dressing.  Using a vegetable peeler, shave thin slices of
  Parmesan over each portion.  Serve immediately.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
  
  ANCHOVY SPREAD: 12 anchovy fillets, drained 2 teaspoons Dijon-style
  mustard 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 2 tablespoons
  extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room
  temperature 1 clove garlic, finely minced Using a fork, mash the
  anchovies in a small bowl. In another small bowl, whisk the remaining
  ingredients together. Add to the anchovies and mix until a paste has
  formed. Makes about 1/4 cup. CAESAR DRESSING: 1 teaspoon grated lemon
  zest 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 cloves garlic, minced 1
  teaspoon white wine vinegar 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon
  coarsely ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt

      Title: LEMONY CREME BRULEE
 Categories: Desserts, French
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Egg yolks
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 c  Heavy cream
    2/3 c  Milk
           Grated rind of 1 lemon
      6 tb Brown sugar
 
  Heat heavy cream and lemon rind until almost boiling. Strain. Cream
  yolks with sugar until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Slowly pour
  hot cream into yolk/sugar mix, stirring gently. Pour mixture into
  ungreased oven proof custard cups. Bake in a bain marie at 350 F (150
  C) for about 50 minutes, until custard is set. Remove from oven, cool
  to room temperature and refrigerate overnight, covered.
  
  Traditional serving suggestion: place cooled custard cups on a baking
  sheet.  Sprinkle brown sugar evenly but sparingly over the surface of
  the custards. Place under a very hot broiler until the sugar just
  melts, about 1 minute. Wait another 1 minute and serve. The sugar
  should be warm and crispy, and the custard cool and smooth.
  
  Note: I think this custard is better served cold, without the melted
  brown sugar on top of it.

  ZESTING LEMONS
  
  A lemon zester is an invaluable kitchen tool. Another very successful
  method is to use a vegetable peeler to pull long, thin slices of zest
  off the lemon. Always avoid the bitter white pith when zesting any
  citrus.

  "real" harira before so I can't vouch for the authenticity.
  
  The next time I make this, I might leave out the tumeric. It turned
  the chickpeas and the potatoes an unnatural shade of yellow, IMHO.

      Title: LEMON~ MEATLOAF & ZUCCHINI SOUP
 Categories: Meatloaf, Soup
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 ts Olive oil
    1/4 c  Chopped onion
      2 c  Low sodium chicken broth
    1/2 ts Dried oregano

  Chop 1/4 section of a medium, yellow, onion.  Heat the oil and cook
  the onion until soft and just beginning to brown, about 8 minutes,
  maximum. Add 2 to 2-1/2 cups of canned chicken broth (reduced sodium
  and/or reduced fat). Add the oregano, rubbing it between the palms as
  you add it. Remove the rind from a lemon wedge (1/8th whole) and add
  that. Add the ('ready in 5-minutes' kind of...) rice. Simmer about 5
  minutes, stirring (rice will be a little under done); taste and
  adjust lemon, oregano, pepper, if needed. Add zucchini, separating
  slices as you add. Simmer about 2 minutes. Cut leftover meatloaf into
  bite-sized pieces and add that. Warm through. Serve with a multigrain
  oat bran bread.

      Title: LENCSELEVES FOGOYHUSSAL (LENTIL SOUP WITH PAR
 Categories: Soups/stews, Game, Fowl, Hungary
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 ea Partridges
      1 c  Lentils
      6 c  Broth, chicken
      1 lb Veal bones
      1 md Carrots; peeled
      1 ea Parsnip; peeled
      1 ea Celery knob; peeled
    1/4 lb Bacon, smoked
      2 tb Flour, all-purpose
      1 sm Onions; chopped
    1/2 ts Mustard, prepared
    1/3 c  Heavy cream
 
    Soak partridges in cold water 3-4 hours. Place lentils in soup pot
  with chicken broth, veal bones, carrot, parsnip and celery. Slowly
  bring to a boil.
    Cut smoked bacon into small dice and render fat. With slotted spoon
  remove cracklings and set aside.
    Dry partridges. Very quickly brown the whole bird in the bacon
  drippings, giving them some color. Remove partridges and place in
  soup pot with lentils.
    Make a roux with the same fat used to brown the partridges and the
  flour and onion. Add 1/2 cup cold water and whip until smooth.
    When partridges and lentils are done, about 2 hours, add liquified
  roux. Cook for an additional 10 minutes. Take out partridges and bone
  them. Replace meat chunks in soup. Just before serving, whip mustard
  and cream into the soup.
  
    Note: partridges can be one of the toughest birds in the world, and
  the 2 hour cooking time may be longer. This is an excellent way to
  prepare what would otherwise be a very tough bird.

      Title: LENNY'S CHEESECAKE (LEN LOVES SIN)
 Categories: Cheesecakes, Party
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -FRANCES NOSSEN   (SWTK50B)
      4    8-oz pkgs cream cheese; or 5
           -(STORE brand; not Philly)
      2 c  Sugar
      1 ts REAL vanilla
      6    Eggs; beaten
     10 oz Sour cream
 
  So here's the recipe for a crustless cheesecake given to me by my
  friend of about 30 years; Len Simon. Soften cream cheese and beat
  until SMOOTH. (I 'defrost' it in the nuker.) Add the sugar and
  vanilla and beat well. Add the eggs and sour cream. Pour batter into
  a buttered 10" round, 2" deep cake pan (or comparable springform).
  Place pan in another pan of water about 1/2" deep (I use my broiler
  pan) and bake @ 350 for 45 - 60 minutes or until top begins to turn a
  light toast color. The cake will not be set. Remove from oven and
  cool, then refrigerate for about 2 hours. If you have used a
  springform pan, you can remove the cake and serve. I use the cake
  pan, so I freeze the cake in the pan. To de-pan, I turn a stove
  burner to high and move the pan around on the burner for about 45
  seconds. Then I invert it over a plate. If the cake does not fall out
  of the pan, I give it another turn on the burner for about 10 seconds
  and try again. Sometimes, tapping the inverted pan on the bottom
  hastens the process. I then either wrap the cake and replace in
  freezer for later use or let it continue to defrost in the fridge.
  
  AH, I guess these instructions are too detailed for you, but someone
  else may need them.  Anyway, this is a very basic, creamy cake...good
  served with canned toppings, fresh fruit, sauce of your choice, etc.
  It serves 10 to 16 people, depending on how many of them are watching
  their weight or cholesterol.  Can be re-frozen. I like it as is, but
  my uncle has added hazelnuts to the batter.  Who knows

           -peeled, cored, and cut into
           Small triangular wedges
 
  Serves 4 to 6
  
  LENTILS:
  
  Run the lentils through your hands to make sure there are no stones or
  other foreign bodies in them.  Rinse them in two changes of water and
  put into a pan.  Add onion, salt to taste, and enough water to come
  about 2 inches above the surface of the lentils.  Set over medium
  heat and bring to a fast simmer.  Continue simmering until the
  lentils are quite soft - about 3 hours, depending on their age. Keep
  a pan of near-boiling water on the side, ready to add if necessary.
  
  Put the pork pieces into a pan; add salt to taste and water to cover.
  Bring to a fast simmer and continue simmering until the pork is
  tender but not soft - about 25 minutes. Strain, reserving the broth,
  and set broth and meat aside.
  
  Cover the dried chilies with boiling water and leave to soak for
  about 15 minutes, until the chilies have softened and become fleshy.
  Drain and put into a blender with 1 cup of the reserved pork broth,
  the broiled tomatoes, garlic, oregano, clove, and cinnamon; blend
  until smooth, adding more broth only if needed to release the blades
  of the blender.
  
  Heat the lard in a small frying pan, add the blended ingredients, and
  fry over medium heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan,
  until reduced and well seasoned - about 4 minutes. Add to the lentils
  and add the pork, remaining broth, plantain, and pineapple; simmer
  together for about 30 minutes. Adjust salt and add water if
  necessary. The mixture should be like a thick soup.

  tender but not soft - about 25 minutes. Strain, reserving the broth,
  and set broth and meat aside.
  
  Cover the dried chilies with boiling water and leave to soak for
  about 15 minutes, until the chilies have softened and become fleshy.
  Drain and put into a blender with 1 cup of the reserved pork broth,
  the broiled tomatoes, garlic, oregano, clove, and cinnamon; blend
  until smooth, adding more broth only if needed to release the blades
  of the blender.
  
  Heat the lard in a small frying pan, add the blended ingredients, and
  fry over medium heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan,
  until reduced and well seasoned - about 4 minutes. Add to the lentils
  and add the pork, remaining broth, plantain, and pineapple; simmer
  together for about 30 minutes. Adjust salt and add water if
  necessary. The mixture should be like a thick soup.

  Bring to a fast simmer and continue simmering until the pork is
  tender but not soft - about 25 minutes. Strain, reserving the broth,

  Drain and put into a blender with 1 cup of the reserved pork broth,
  the broiled tomatoes, garlic, oregano, clove, and cinnamon; blend
  until smooth, adding more broth only if needed to release the blades
  of the blender.
  
  Heat the lard in a small frying pan, add the blended ingredients, and

  and add the pork, remaining broth, plantain, and pineapple; simmer

      Title: LENTIL & COD CHOWDER
 Categories: None
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Dried lentils
      1 lb Cod fillet, cut into 1"
           -(2.5 cm) squares
           Lots of diced vegetables
           -(carrots, potatoes, onions,
           -turnip, celery,
           -green beans, tomatoes, ...)
    1/4 c  Orange juice
      2 tb Sunflower or green olive oil
      1 tb Dried parsley
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 ts Ground black pepper
    1/4 ts Thyme
    1/8 ts Tarragon
 
  ** Procedure  **
  
  1) Place the lentils and 5 cups of cold water into a slow cooker
  (about 4 quart or 4 litre size) or crock pot. Cook on low overnight.
  
  2) At breakfast, add the spices, oil, and enough vegetables to fill
  the pot to no closer than 8 cm (3 inches) below the top. Then add
  enough cold water to cover everything, plus 1 cm (1/2 inch). Cook on
  low for 5 hours.
  
  3) Add the fish (the fish should be completely immersed in the
  liquid), and then cook on low for another 4 to 5 hours.
  
  4) A few minutes before serving, remove the bay leaf and mix in the
  orange juice. Serve with salad and whole grain bread.
  
  :          **  Variations  **
  
  Substitute haddock, pollock, hake, cusk, clams, or lean back bacon
  (diced) for some or all of the cod. Back bacon should be put in the
  slow cooker in step #2, at the same time as the vegetables.
  
  Note: Frozen fish should be thawed overnight in the refrigerator.

      Title: LENTIL & CORN SOUP
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 md Onion, chopped
      2 md Carrots, sliced
      2 tb Water, stock, or sherry for
           Sauteing
      7 c  Water
    3/4 c  Dried lentils
      2 md Tomatoes
      1 c  Fresh or frozen corn
      1 sm Sweet potato, diced
      4 ts Tamari or soy sauce
      1 c  Cooked brown rice
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley (I
           Double this amount)
 
  Corn and sweet potatoes give this soup a nice sweetness. It's adapted
  from Mark Bricklin's _Lose Weight Naturally Cookbook_ (Rodale), which
  uses too much meat and dairy for our purposes; this one, however,
  adapts well by substituting for the oil in the saute. It also freezes
  and microwaves well for brown-bag lunches.
  
  Saute the onion and carrots in a large saucepan over low heat,
  stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent.
  
  Add water, lentils, tomatoes, corn, and sweet potato. Bring to a boil,
  reduce heat, cover and simmer for 25 min. Add the tamari, rice and
  parsley, and heat through before serving.

      Title: LENTIL & GREENS KHORESHE
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
    1/3 c  Oil
      1 ts Turmeric
  2 1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Lemon or lime juice
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      8    Green onions; chopped
    1/2 lb Spinach leaves
           -- coarsely chopped
    1/4 lb Fresh parsley; chopped
      2 oz Fresh cilantro; chopped
      2 oz Tareh; chopped
           -OR chopped garlic chives
      1 c  Brown lentils; rinsed
 
  A 'khoreshe' is a sauce-like main dish, to be served with rice.
  'Tareh' resembles leeks, but much smaller, and has a garlic flavor.
  
  In a heavy pan, brown the onion in oil over medium heat, stirring
  frequently.  Add turmeric and fry for another minute or so. Add
  remaining ingredients, stir, and cover. Decrease heat to low and let
  simmer until lentils are tender, about 40 minutes.  Adjust seasonings
  if necessary and serve khoreshe with the best quality of rice you can
  obtain; basmati is what I recommend. Wholemeal flatbread is nice
  also, especially for dipping into the khoreshe.
  
  Variation: Substitute 1/2 pound of fresh or frozen fava beans for the
  lentils.  Decrease water to 1-1/2 cups.

      Title: LENTIL & LEEK RISOTTO [T]
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      4    Chopped leeks (green and
           White parts, well washed)
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
      1    Red pepper, finely chopped
      3 c  Vegetable broth or water
  1 1/4 c  Brown rice
        x  Salt and pepper to taste
      1 tb Approx. chopped fresh basil
           Or a pinch dried basil
      1 c  Cooked lentils
    1/4 c  Freshly chopped parsley
    1/4 c  Finely grated carrots
 
  In a 4 quart deep pot with cover, saute leeks, garlic and red pepper
  in a small amount of the broth.  When soft, add the rest of the broth
  or water, and stir in rice along with seasonings. Reduce heat and
  simmer covered for about 40 minutes or until rice is done. Uncover,
  stir in cooked lentils and reheat until lentils are hot. Garnish with
  parsley and grated carrot before serving.
  
  *I deleted 1T of olive oil for sauteing, so the nutritional
  information of 368 total calories and 6g of fat is off by whatever 1T
  olive oil accounts for.
   I also changed 1 clove garlic to 4, and 2 leeks to 4. It was too
  mild for me in it's original incarnation. I also liked it better with
  basmati brown rice, though the dish then became a pseudorisotto in
  texture.
  
  Delicious and easy if you keep cooked lentils around!

      Title: LENTIL & SPINACH SOUP ADAS BI SABAANIKH (V
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Dried lentils
      8 c  Water
      1 lg Onion; chopped
      3    Garlic cloves; crushed
      6 oz Tomato paste

    1/2 c  Fresh parsley
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/8 ts Crushed red hot pepper flake
    1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
 
  This is a Middle Eastern soup, typical of the simple foods served in
  the desert regions. Serve with pita bread and a grain or vegetable
  dish for a simple meal. This soup is also food served cold, stuffed
  into a pita bread. Place the lentils and water in a large pot. Bring
  to a boil, cover, and cook for 30 minutes over medium low heat. Add
  the onion , tomato paste and garlic and cook an additional 30
  minutes. Add the spinach, parsley, and peppers. Mix well and cook for
  another 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice just before serving. Mix in
  well and serve at once. I added a bit of fresh ground nutmeg & salt
  to taste. Note: I have found that balsamic vinegar in place of lemon
  juice is wonderful with lentils and imparts a slightly sweet taste...

      Title: LENTIL & WALNUT SALAD
 Categories: Main dish, Grains, Salads, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Dried lentils
      3    Carrots
           -- peeled and quartered
      1 md Yellow onion; peeled
      3    Cloves
  1 1/2 qt Chicken stock or
  1 1/2 qt Canned chicken broth
           -- (I used this)
      1    Bay leaf
      2 ts Dried thyme
    1/3 c  White wine vinegar
      3    Garlic cloves; peeled
    1/2 c  Walnut oil
           Salt to taste*
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -- to taste
      1 c  Thinly sliced scallions
           -- incl. tops
      1 c  Shelled walnut halves

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Chopped Italian parsley**
 
  *I used 1/2 tsp. plus a pinch of salt, and several grinds of fresh
  pepper.
  
  **I used lots and included stems as well.
  
  Note: One of the best lentil salads I've ever tasted. I serve it as a
  main dish and so it ends up making somewhere between 2 and 4
  servings, depending upon how hungry people are.
  
  The authors write:  "A good lentil salad makes an excellent first
  course, and this is one of the best we have ever tasted."
  
  Rinse lentils and sort through them carefully, discarding any pebbles
  that you find.
  
  Transfer lentils to a large pot and add the carrots, onion stuck with
  cloves, chicken stock, bay leaf and thyme. Set over moderate heat;
  bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, skim any foam that may appear
  (wasn't any when I made), cover and cook for about 25 minutes (lentil
  cooking time varies widely), or until lentils are tender but still
  hold their shape. Do not overcook.  (I cooked about 28 to 31 minutes.)
  
  While lentils are cooking, combine vinegar, garlic and walnut oil in a
  blender or in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade;
  process until smooth and creamy.
  
  When lentils are done, drain them, discard the carrots, onion, cloves
  and bay leaf, and pour lentils into a mixing bowl. (I saved the
  carrots to eat, and they were good.) Rewhisk dressing and pour it
  over the still-hot lentils.  Toss gently, season generously with salt
  and pepper and let salad cool to room temperature. Toss again, cover
  and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Just before serving, add scallions and walnuts.  Add an additional
  tablespoon or two of vinegar or walnut oil if you like; toss gently.
  Sprinkle heavily with chopped parsley and serve.
  
  Note: I skipped extra vinegar and oil.  I also added nuts, onion and
  parsley when preparing rest of salad.
  
  Yield: 6 to 8 portions as a first course.

      Title: LENTIL & WHEATBERRY SALAD
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Wheat berries
      2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Lentils (this was all I had
           On hand--more would be
           Better)
      1 c  Water
        x  Assorted vegetables
        x  Herbs
        x  Fatfree dressing
 
  Put wheat berries and 2 cups water in a saucepan, bring to a boil,
  reduce heat, cover and simmer 45 min to 1 hour, until berries are
  tender, but still chewy (not mushy).
  
  Sort lentils, removing any deformed ones and any stones that may be
  mixed in. Rinse a couple of times, then put them in saucepan with 1
  cup of water, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer about 30
  minutes, again, so they are done but not mushy.
  
  When both lentils and wheatberries are done, drain any excess water,
  put into large bowl and chill while you cut up vegetables. Vegetables
  can vary according to what you have on hand. I used:
  
  yellow summer squash green pepper sweet onion peas (I used frozen
  peas, straight from the bag--they helped chill the lentils and
  wheatberries while thawing) mushrooms parsley (1-2 Tbsp chopped
  fresh) basil (1 Tbsp chopped fresh)
  
  For a dressing I used some 7-Seas fatfree red wine vinegar
  dressing--just enough to coat everything, but not so much that it was
  swimming in dressing.  The bits of red pepper in the dressing also
  added a little more color to the salad. (I would have added some
  chopped tomato, but we were out.) Toss everything together well and
  chill (if you have time; I only chilled it about 15 minutes last
  night--but the veggies were all cold when I added them--and the
  frozen peas helped out, too). I served this with a crusty sourdough
  bread.  It made 3 servings. (Two for us last night, with enough left
  for my lunch today.)

      1 c  Bread crumbs
           - (preferably wholewheat)

      2    Garlic cloves; minced
           - more to taste
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
  Wash lentils thoroughly & pick out any sticks & stones & grit which
  might get in them.  In a large pot, bring the water to a rolling
  boil. Add lentils & cook for 20-25 minutes until the lentils start to
  puree. Drain & let cool. It is not necessary to let them get cold.
  
  Transfer the cooked lentils to a large mixing bowl.
   Add bread crumbs, garlic & onion & mix thoroughly. Season well.
  
  You then can experiment with herbs & spices.  I usually add loads of
  cajun spice, with healthy measures of parsley, basil & majoram. You
  could try thyme or sage.  It is your choice.
  
  If the mixture does not hold together well enough, add more bread
  crumbs. Form into patties & then cook as you would a regular
  hamburger in a little oil.  Or barbecue. If they are really dry, then
  they hold together well enough to barbecue.
  
  Serve in buns with old fashioned dijon mustard & chips ooops, errrr
  fries.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Water
      1 c  Lentils
      1    Onion, chopped (recipe
           Called for "small" onion, I
           Used a large one)
      1    Green pepper, chopped
      2 ts Garlic (I used fresh
           Oil-free garlic from a jar)
      1 ts Red pepper
      1 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Cumin
    1/2 c  Salsa
      1 ea Ff tortillas

MMMMM---------------------OPTIONAL GARNISHES--------------------------
      1 ea Chopped fresh tomatoes
      1 ea Salsa
 
  Put water and beans in saucepan on med high heat. Add all ingredients
  except salsa and tortillas. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionlly.
  Reduce heat and let cook til lentils are soft, about 45 minutes.
  (Keep stirring because the beans will stick to the bottom of the
  pot.) Once the beans are mushy, add salsa, stir well.
  
  Place in tortillas, garnish as desired, and enjoy.
  
  NOTE: I didn't soak the beans beforehand and haven't experienced any
  problems. Mary McD says, in this book, that you don't need to soak
  lentils.

      Title: LENTIL SAVOY
 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Lentils
  1 1/2    + cups  well-spiced veggie
           -stock
    1/2 lb Mushrooms
    1/2    Head purple kale (aka salad
           -savoy) - 1 mixing-bowl-full
           -voy) - 1 mixing-bowl-full
      1    Red bell pepper
    1/2    -1 Tbsp
           -cinammon
 
  1. Rinse lentils and cook in 1 1/2 cups of veggie stock. (I used a
  rice cooker for this step.)
  
  2. While the lentils are cooking cut the stems off of the kale. Chop
  stems into 1/2 - 1 inch peices
  
  3. Chop the red bell pepper.
  
  4. Put pepper and stems in large pan with enough stock to cover the
  bottom of the pan (1/4"?) and cook on medium for a couple of minutes
  then turn flame all the way down.
  
  5. While the peppers etc. are cooking wash and chop mushrooms. Add to
  pan.
  
  6. Around 20-30 minutes after step 1. (probably 5-10 minutes after
  end of step 5.) pour the lentils into the pan. If you are using the
  rice cooker, just shut it off manually - don't wait for it to finish.
  
  7. Add cinnamon and other spices (see note).  Stir mixture in pan
  then add the kale leaves on top - this will steam the leaves, don't
  mix them in.
  
  8. Cook for another 15 minutes or so until the leaves have a buttery
  taste.
  
  9. Remove the kale from the top and serve separately.
  
  Have some black pepper available on the table for the lentil stew.
  Try the kale leaves with some nutritional yeast...
  
  NOTES: * If you don't have stock handy try adding alot of spices in
  step 7. Try oregano, chile passilla, roasted garlic, etc. * Use wild
  mushrooms if at all possible - they are more expensive than buttons
  (unless you or friends go mushrooming) but are worth it for the extra
  taste. (IMHO, of course. ;-) * Purple kale - you know, the type they
  use as a decoration in salad bars... Shared by J. Ari Kornfeld

  I usually don't add the green pepper, but add corn instead. My family
  prefers this.  I usually use a can of stewed tomatoes instead of whole
  tomatoes.  I think the mustard gives this a wonderful flavor. Hope you
  enjoy!

  Sort & rinse lentils.  Add water & cook for 30 minutes. You want to
  ensure that the lentils are cooked through, but don't overcook them
  otherwise they will become mushy.  Drain & set aside.
  
  While the lentils are cooking, add the boiling water to the bulgur &
  fluff with a fork.  Let sit until the water has all been absorbed.
  This will take about 20 minutes, fluff occasionally.
  
  Combine the bulgur with the seasonings.  Mix well & add the lentils
  when they have cooked to the desired consistency. Again, ensure that
  the ingredients have been well combined. Cover tightly & refrigerate.
  Serve garnished with lemon wedges.

      Title: LENTIL-WALNUT BURGERS
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Dry lentils
  1 1/2 c  Water
      2 ts Cider vinegar
      1 tb Butter
      1 c  Onion; finely minced
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
     10 lg Mushrooms; minced
    1/2 c  Walnuts; finely minced
      1 sm Celery stalk; finely minced
      1 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Dry mustard
      1 tb Dry sherry
    1/2 c  Raw wheat germ
 
   This takes about 40 minutes to prepare: you can do "part 1" while
  "part 2" is cooking, plus about 1 hour to chill, then 15 minutes to
  cook.
  
   Makes between 4 to 6 servings, depending on the size of patties you
  make and the hunger of participants.
  
   Note: uncooked burgers may be individually wrapped and frozen.
  
  Part 1:  Bring lentils and water to a boil in saucepan. Lower the
  heat, and simmer, partly-covered, 30 minutes, or until lentils are
  soft, and liquid is gone. Place in large-ish bowl. Add vinegar, and
  mash.
  
  Part 2:  Saute remaining ingredients, except for wheat germ, together
  over medium-low heat 10 to 15 minutes, or until all is tender. Add to
  the mashed lentils, and mix well. Add wheat germ and mix again. Chill
  for about 1 hour.
  
  The Burgers:
  
   1. Make 4-inch patties from chilled burger-mixture. For freezing,
  make patties, place wax paper between each patty and stack; wrap well
  and freeze (or wrap individually).
  
   2. Fry burgers in butter until brown, *or* broil about 8 minutes on
  each side.  Try putting sesame seeds in pan to keep burgers from
  sticking to pan, if it is a problem.
  
   3. Serve either as patties, or as burgers in a whole-wheat bun. Good
  with cheese melted on top, basil sprinkled on each burger is tasty
  also.
  
  I think I got this one out of the Moosewood Cookbook a few years
  back...

 Categories: Mexico
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Lentils
      3 c  Water
    1/2 c  Chopped scallions (green &
           White parts), or onion
           (either is good)
    1/2 c  Green peppers, diced
    1/2 c  Red peppers, diced
      1 tb Chili powder (adjust to
           Taste, esp. if you use spicy
           Chili powder)
    1/2 ts Cumin seeds, crushed (what I
           Use) or 1 tsp ground cumin
      4    Cloves minced garlic
      1    To 2 TBSP red wine vinegar
      1    8 oz can tomato sauce
      1 tb Molasses
 
  Bring the lentils and water to a boil, then cover & simmer for about
  25 - 30 minutes until soft but not mushy. While the lentils cook,
  saute the scallions, pepppers, garlic, chili powder and cumin in 1
  TBSP vinegar til the vegetables are limp (about 2 mins). (NB: I do
  use a nonstick pan for this step.) Add tomato sauce and molasses,
  cook for 1 minute (scrape the stuck pieces off the pan), taste and
  add more vinegar if needed (I usually add another TBSP). Add mixture
  to lentils and cook until heated through.
  
  Great over rice, or maybe as a burrito or taco filling (recommend
  using less than 3c. water then, since this comes out very sauce-y).

    1/2 lb (1 heaped cup) lentils,
           -brown if available
    1/2 sm White onion
           Sea salt to taste
           The pork:
      1 lb Boneless stewing pork, cut
           -into 1-inch cubes
           Sea salt to taste
           The seasoning and final
           -cooking:
      5 sm Chilies anchos, cleaned of
           -veins and seeds and
           Lightly toasted
    1/4 lb Tomatoes, broiled
      1    Garlic clove, peeled and
           -roughly chopped
    1/4 ts Dried oregano, Mexican if
           -possible
      1    Whole clove
  1 1/2    Inch cinnamon stick
      1 tb Melted lard or safflower oil
      1 md Plantain (about 8-oz),
           -peeled and cut into
    1/4    Inch cubes
      2    Thick pineapple slices,
           -peeled, cored, and cut into
           Small triangular wedges
 
  The lentils: Run the lentils through your hands to make sure there
  are no stones or other foreign bodies in them. Rinse them in two
  changes of water and put into a pan. Add onion, salt to taste, and
  enough water to come about 2 inches above the surface of the lentils.
  Set over medium heat and bring to a fast simmer. Continue simmering
  until the lentils are quite soft ~ about 3 hours, depending on their
  age. Keep a pan of near-boiling water on the side, ready to add if
  necessary.
  
  Put the pork pieces into a pan; add salt to taste and water to cover.
  Bring to a fast simmer and continue simmering until the pork is
  tender but not soft - about 25 minutes. Strain, reserving the broth,
  and set broth and meat aside.
  
  Cover the dried chilies with boiling water and leave to soak for
  about 15 minutes, until the chilies have softened and become fleshy.
  Drain and put into a blender with 1 cup of the reserved pork broth,
  the broiled tomatoes, garlic, oregano, clove, and cinnamon; blend
  until smooth, adding more broth only if needed to release the blades
  of the blender.
  
  Heat the lard in a small frying pan, add the blended ingredients, and
  fry over medium heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan,
  until reduced and well seasoned - about 4 minutes. Add to the lentils
  and add the pork, remaining broth, plantain, and pineapple; simmer
  together for about 30 minutes. Adjust salt and add water if
  necessary. The mixture should be like a thick soup.

 Categories: Italian, Pork, Vegetables, Meats
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 lb Dry lentils
           Cold water
      2 lb Fresh italian sausage, sweet
           Or hot
           About 3 cups homemade or
           Canned chicken broth
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
      1    Rib celery, finely chopped
      1    Carrot, finely chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, finely minced
      8    Fresh sage leaves, chopped,
           Or 1 tsp. dried, rubbed sage
           Salt and pepper to taste
      3 tb Tomato paste, diluted in a
           Little water
 
  Clean lentils well by soaking them briefly and changing the water at
  least once.  Put them in a 2-1/2-quart saucepan, add cold water to
  cover, and bring to a boil.  Lower heat to simmer and cook until not
  quite done, about 45 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, pierce sausages in several places, and then put them in a
  small saucepan.  Add enough chicken broth to cover, and place over
  medium heat. Bring to a gentle boil, and simmer for about 40 minutes.
  From time to time, skim off and discard foam and fat that rise to the
  top. When sausages are done, remove the pot from the heat and let
  them sit in the broth while you finish the lentils.
  
  Warm the oil in a medium skillet, and saute' the onion, celery,
  carrot, garlic and sage in the olive oil over medium heat until the
  onion is translucent and the vegetables are done. Drain the lentils,
  saving their liquid.  To the lentil pot, add the vegetables, season
  with salt and pepper, and add tomato paste. Mix gently using a wooden
  spoon. Add 3/4 cup of the broth in which you cooked the sausages.
  Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed.
  
  To serve, slice the sausages and arrange them on a platter next to
  the warm lentils.

      2 md Carrots, chopped

           Sliced

        x  Black pepper
        x  Dried garlic  [I'm out of
           Fresh :-( ]
      1    Bay leaf
      5 c  Water (or use part broth if
           You want)
 
  Put everything in a large pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and
  simmer about 30-40 minutes.  Remove bay leaf. Serve over brown rice
  (or maybe potatoes). Makes 4 reasonably sized servings.
  
  The vegetables used were the ones I happened to have on hand. Vary to
  suit yourself.  Leeks are great in this. If I want this to be more
  soup-like, I add more water and a can of tomatoes, pureed. I've also
  put potatoes in the pot with the rest of the veggies.  The
  possibilities are endless...

  whole egg and blend mixture well.  Remove paddle and replace with a
  dough hook. Add flour, mixing thoroughly. Form dough into a ball,
  wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate 2 hours.
  
  Roll dough out to a thickness of slightly more than 1/8 inch. Cut
  dough into 35 1 1/2-inch ovals with pointed ends and place on
  ungreased cookie sheets. Bake in a preheated 350F oven 15 to 20
  minutes, or until cookies are a light caramel color. Lemon Cream: In
  a small saucepan over medium-high heat combine eggs, sugar, butter,

      Title: LES RILLETES DE TOURS (PORK SPREAD)
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Fresh pork fatback
      1 tb Coarse salt
   9/16 lb Fresh, lean, boneless pork
      2    Plump cloves garlic,
           -unpeeled
      1    Branch dried thyme
      1    Bay leaf
      3    Peppercorns
      1 c  Water
 
  Makes about 1 pound.
  
  1. Remove the rind from the fatback. Discard it or save it for another
  purpose.
  
  2. Work the salt into all surfaces of the meat. Place it in a
  noncorrosive bowl, cover it, and refrigerate it overnight.
  
  3. Next day, dry the meat by patting it with paper towels. Don't be at
  pains to remove the salt. Cut both the fat and the lean meat into
  small thin pieces about
        2    inches by 1/4 inch.
  
       4.    Preheat the oven to 300^F
  
  5. Wrap the garlic, thyme, bay leaf and peppercorns in a piece of
  cheesecloth and tie it up securely. Put this sachet at the bottom of
  an ovenproof earthenware pot (you can use a beanpot with a lid) Put
  the chopped meat in the pot and add the water. Seal the pot with a
  piece of aluminum foil and press the lid down over the foil into the
  lid groove of the pot.
  
  6. Put the pot on the center rack of the oven and bake it for 3.1/2
  hours. Turn off the oven, but leave the pot in there for another 1/2
  hour.
  
  7. Place a large, stout sieve over a bowl. Break the seal on the pot
  and empty the contents into the sieve. Discard the sachet.
  
  8. Break the bits of meat apart with your fingers. Then, working with
  2 forks, pull the fibers apart. This operation is very essential for
  genuine rilletes, which are not a paste. They are very finely
  shredded pork and fat. (Don't make the mistake of putting the meat
  into the food processor and making a fine pate of it.)
  
  NOTE: You may eat the rilletes all at once if you like, but mix the
  shredded meat with a little of the dripping in a ratio of 2 parts
  shredded meat to 1 part dripping. You may also pack the rilletes into
  jars or pots and pour the dripping over them. Make certain that the
  dripping covers the rilletes at least 1/4 inch deep. Cover the tops
  of the pots or jars with foil. They will keep for a month or so under
  refrigeration. Make sure your pots are sterilized. An easy way to do
  that is by washing them well and rinsing them out with a few drops of
  Cognac. Be sure that the spread is at room temperature when you serve
  it. If you try to eat it cold, you will be astonished how tasteless
  and greasy it seems. When it is served at room temperature you get
  the full benefit of the long cooking, and the faint, savory perfume
  and taste of the garlic and herbs. The spread is at its best on
  crusty, freshly baked French bread.

      Title: LESSON: CRACKLING CANDY APPLES
 Categories: Fruits, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 sm Red apples
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Corn syrup
    1/4 ts Red food colouring
 
  1. Remove stem from each small apple; insert wooden stir-stick, for
  holding, in centre of stem end. Set aside. Grease baking sheet; set
  aside.
  
  2. In 12-cup heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine sugar, water and corn
  syrup; cook, stirring, over medium-low heat for 8 minutes or until
  sugar has dissolved. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil,
  brushing down side of pan occasionally with brush, dipped in hot
  water to prevent crystallization.
  
  3. Boil, brushing down side occasionally but not stirring, for 15-25
  minutes or until soft-crack stage of 290F 143C on candy thermometer,
  or until 1/2 ts syrup dropped into cold water separates into hard but
  pliable threads.
  
  4. Remove syrup from heat; very quickly stir in red food colouring.
  Immediately plunge bottom of pan into ice water and hold for about 15
  seconds or until sizzling stops.
  
  5. Holding each apple by the wooden stick and tilting the saucepan,
  swirl each apple in candy syrup until well coated all over.
  
  6. Lift apple and quickly swirl over pan to allow excess to drip off.
  Place on prepared baking sheet; let stand at room temperature for at
  least 30 minutes or until hardened.
  
  Tip: Choose the reddest small apples available. Macintosh, Spartan and
  Courtland apples are excellent.
  
  Watch the boiling sugar mixture carefully, because the temperature
  rises quickly near the end of the cooking process and the mixture
  burns easily; plunging the pan into ice water stops the cooking and
  prevents burning. Wear rubber gloves when swirling the apples to
  avoid sugar burns.
  
  Store apples, loosely covered with plastic wrap, for up to 2 days at
  room temperature.

      Title: LEVEROPOSTEJ (LIVER PASTE)
 Categories: Appetizers, Meats
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      3 tb Flour
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1 c  Milk
      1 lb Pork liver; fresh
    3/4 lb Pork fat; fresh
      1 md Onion; coarsely chopped
      3    Flat anchovy fillets; draind
      2    Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Allspice
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
    3/4 lb Pork fat; fresh, sliced into
           -long, 1/8" thick strips or
           -sheets
 
  Melt the butter in a saucepan, remove from the heat, and stir in the
  flour. Add the milk and cream and bring to a boil over high heat,
  beating constantly with a whisk until the sauce is smooth and thick.
  Let it simmer for a minute then set aside to cool. Cut the liver into
  chunks. Roughly chop the pork fat and mix both with the chopped onion
  and anchovies. Divide the mixture into thirds. Pure each batch in an
  electric blender set at high speed, adding enough sauce to keep the
  mixture from clogging the blender. Transfer each completed batch to a
  large bowl and beat in any remaining cream sauce. (To make by hand,
  first have the butcher grind the liver and pork fat together, 3
  times, very fine, then combine with the cream sauce, beating them
  together thoroughly.) Beat the eggs well with the salt, pepper,
  allspice and cloves and mix thoroughly into the liver mixture. The
  blender mixture will be considerably more fluid that the one made by
  hand. Preheat the oven to 350øF. Line a 1-quart loaf pan or mold with
  the strips of pork fat. Arrange the strips lengthwise or crosswise,
  making sure they overlap slightly and cover the bottom and sides of
  the pan. If long enough, let them hang over the sides; otherwise,
  save enough strips to cover the top. Spoon the liver mixture into the
  loaf pan and fold the overhanging strips (or extra strips) of pork
  fat over the top. Cover with a double thickness of aluminum foil,
  sealing the edges tightly, and place in a large baking pan. Pour into
  the baking pan enough boiling water to reach at least halfway up the
  side of the load pan and bake the liver paste in the center of the
  oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and lift off the foil.
  When it cools to room temperature, re-cover with foil and chill
  thoroughly. Liver paste may be served in 1/2" thick slices as a first
  course, luncheon dish, or on bread as smorrebrod.

      Title: LICK THE DASHER ICE CREAM
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Salt
      4 c  Milk
      4    Eggs, beaten
      2 tb Vanilla
      4 c  Light cream
 
  Mix sugar, cornstarch and salt in the top of a double boiler. Blend
  in milk gradually and cook over hot water, stirring occasionally
  until mixture is thickened, about 12-15 minutes. Blend in a small
  amount of the hot mixture into the eggs, then stir the eggs into the
  rest of the mixture. Cook 4-5 minutes more, stirring constantly.
  Chill custard (I chill overnight if possible). Add vanilla and
  chilled cream. Fill freezer not more than 2/3 full. Freeze in
  hand-cranked or electric freezer with a mixture of 1 part ice cream
  salt to 6 parts crushed Ice. When mixture is frozen, the electric
  motor grinds to a halt; the hand crank can no longer be turned.
  Remove the dasher and repack the freezer with ice and salt -- i part
  salt to 8 parts ice. Cover with a rug or blanket and let cream ripen
  in the freezer for about 2 hours. Or pack into containers and
  transfer to a home freezer for hardening.
  
  Variations:
  
  Butter Pecan - use brown sugar instead of white, and add 1 cup chopped
  pecans, toasted or sauteed in butter.
  
  Chocolate - add 4 oz unsweetened chocolate, melted, and 1/2 cup more
  sugar to the basic mix.
  
  Peach/Strawberry/Raspberry - Add to the mix 2 cups pureed, slightly
  sweetened fruit.
  
  Lemon - Omit the vanilla and add 1 cup more sugar, 1 cup fresh lemon
  juice, and the grated rind of a couple of lemons. (I haven't tried
  this one yet, but plan to soon!)

      Title: LICORICE CARAMELS
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Butter (not margarine)
      2 c  Sugar
     14 oz Can (1-1/4 cups) sweetened
           -condensed milk
      1 c  Light corn syrup
    1/8 ts Salt
      1 ts Anise extract
    1/2 ts Black or red coloring paste
 
  "A mild, unbelievably delicious licorice flavor. You'll find black
  and red paste for coloring these candies in specialty and
  cake-decorating stores. The black caramels also make great Halloween
  treats--"
  
  Line a 9 x 9 x 2 inch baking pan with foil, extending foil over he
  edges of the pan.  Butter the foil; set aside.
  
  In a heavy 3 quart saucepan melt the butter over low heat. Add the
  sugar, sweetened condensed milk, corn syrup, and salt; mix well.
  Carefully clip a candy thermometer to side of the pan.
  
  Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently; till candy thermometer
  registers 244; firm-ball stage.  The mixture should boil at a
  moderate, steady rate over entire surface. Reaching firm-ball stage
  should take 15 to 20 minutes. (Mixture scorches easily.)  Remove from
  heat; remove candy thermometer from saucepan. Add anise extract and
  coloring, stir to mix.
  
  Quickly pour candy, without scraping into the buttered-foil-lined
  pan. Cool for several hours or till firm. Use foil to lift candy out
  of pan onto cutting board.  Peel foil away; discard.  With a buttered
  sharp knife, cut immediately into 1-inch squares; wrap individually
  in waxed paper., Makes 81 pieces (about 2-3/4 pounds)
  
  To wrap caramels:  Tear off 6-inch strips of waxed paper; cut each
  strip into 4 inch widths, making pieces 6 x 4 inches. Roll caramel in
  length of paper; fold flaps under. Set caramels into gift boxes with
  flaps underneath.  The caramels will pack neatly and stay tightly
  wrapped.

      Title: LICORICE CHUNK ICE CREAM
 Categories: Ice cream
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
  1 1/2 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Sugar
      3    Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 tb Aniseed
    1/2 c  Black licorice whips;chopped
 
  In a heavy 2-quart saucepan or double boiler over medium-low heat,
  stir and heat the cream, milk, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
  Do not boil.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks lightly. While whisking, pour 1
  cup of the hot cream mixture into the bowl, then pour the egg mixture
  back into the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir
  constantly with a wooden spoon (don't let the mixture boil; it could
  curdle) for about 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and coats
  the spoon. To test for doneness, dip a metal spoon into the mixture
  and run your finger across the back. The custard is done when your
  finger leaves a clear, clean trail. A candy thermometer should read
  175-180 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
  vanilla.
  
  With a mortar and pestle, roughly crush the aniseed, or place the
  seeds in a plastic bag and bruise them with a hammer. Stir the
  crushed seeds into the hot ice cream base. Cover and chill in the
  refrigerator for at least 1 hour (the longer it is refrigerated, the
  stronger the flavor will be).
  
  Strain the mixture and add the chopped licorice pieces. Pour the
  mixture into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the
  manufacturer's instructions.

      2 tb Canola oil
  1 1/2 c  Sliced onions
    1/2 lb Mushrooms; sliced
    1/2 lb Beef top round, trimmed of
           -all visible fat and cut

           -strips
      1 tb Flour
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      1    Bay leaf
      1 c  Water
    3/4 lb Chopped Roma tomatoes
    1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 c  Fat-free sour cream
      3 c  Cooked wide egg noodles
 
   Heat the oil over low heat in a large nonstick skillet. Cook the
  onions slowly for 10 minutes until they brown, stirring occasionally.
  Add the mushrooms and cook for 8 minutes longer, covered.
   Remove the onions and mushrooms from the skillet, draining as much
  oil as possible back into the pan. Add the meat and brown slowly on
  all sides, about 6 minutes. Sprinkle the flour, salt and pepper over
  the meat, cooking about 1 minute longer to toast the flour.
   Add the water and bay leaf and  use a wooden spoon to scrape the
  brown bits of meat and onion off the bottom of the pan. The water
  will turn dark, about the colour of beef broth. Bring the mixture to
  a boil and stir until the liquid thickens slightly.
   Add the tomatoes and Worcestershire sauce.  Reduce heat to a simmer,
  cover and cook for 30 minutes. While meat is cooking, boil the
  noodles according to package directions. When ready to serve, turn
  off heat under the meat and stir the fat-free sour cream into the
  sauce. Do not return to heat. Serve each portion of meat and sauce
  over 1/2c noodles.

      Title: LIGHT CHOCOLATE DECADENCE
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes, Low-cal
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      5 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
           -finely chopped
      2 lg Eggs
      1 lg Egg white
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
    1/2 c  Plus 1 tablespoon
           -unsweetened alkaline (Dutch
           -Process) cocoa
      2 tb All-purpose flour
    2/3    Plus 1/4 cup sugar
    3/4 c  Low fat 1% milk
 
  Place oven rack in lower third of the oven, and turn the heat to 350
  degrees F. With nonstick cooking spray, lightly coat inside rim of an
  8 inch wide, 1 1/2 to 2 inch deep round cake pan. Line pan bottom with
  cooking parchment cut to fit.
  
  Place chopped chocolate in a large bowl, set aside. Break 1 egg into a
  small bowl. Separate remaining egg. Put yolk with whole egg. Put
  white in separate larger bowl, and add remaining egg white. Add
  vanilla to the bowl with the yolk. Add cream of tartar to egg whites.
  
  Combine cocoa, flour, and 2/3 cup sugar in a 1 to 1 1/2 quart pan.
  Mixing smoothly with a whisk, gradually add milk. Stir over medium
  heat until mixture simmers, about 6 minutes; don't scorch. Stir and
  cook 1 1/2 minutes longer; then pour hot mixture over chopped
  chocolate. Stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.
  
  Beat egg whites with cream of tartar at medium speed until egg whites
  hold soft peaks. Beating at high speed, gradually add the remaining
  1/4 cup sugar, then beat until whites hold stiff but not dry peaks.
  
  Stir 1/4 of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture, then gently
  fold in the remaining egg whites. Scrape batter into prepared cake
  pan, and smooth the top.
  
  Set cake pan in another pan that is at least 2 inches wider and 2
  inches deep. Set pans in oven. Fill outer pan with boiling water to
  half the depth of the cake pan. Bake just until center of cake
  springs back when very gently pressed- it will be quite gooey.
  
  Lift cake pan from water, and set on a rack to cool. When cake is
  cool to the touch, cover it with plastic wrap, and chill thoroughly
  until cold, at least 8 hours or up to 2 days.
  
  To release cake, slide a thin knife between rim and cake. Cover cake
  with a sheet of waxed paper, then invert a flat plate onto the paper.
  Hold pan and plate together and then invert; shake gently if needed,
  to loosen cake. If cake sticks to pan, place a hot damp towel on on
  pan bottom for a few minutes; then gently shake pan with plate.
  Remove pan. Peel off and discard parchment. Invert serving dish onto
  cake. Supporting with flat plate, turn cake over onto serving dish.
  Remove flat plate and discard wax paper. Cut cake with a thin sharp
  knife, dipping the knife in hot water and wiping clean between cuts.
  Garnish with rasberries and whipped cream.

      4 c  Vegetable broth
      1 lb Carrots, diced
      1 bn Of broccoli flowerets

    1/2 ts Ground curry
    1/8 ts Ground pepper
      1 cn Skimmed evaporated milk
           -chopped parsley
           -(optional)
           -seasoned croutons
           -(optional)
 
  Over low heat in a soup pot, cook half of the carrots, half of the
  broccoli, potatoes, and onion in the broth for about an hour. Add
  milk and stir thoroughly. Puree half of the mixture in a blender
  until smooth, making sure you include a good amount of potatoes.
  Return to the pot. Add the seasonings and remainder of the carrots
  and broccoli and cook about 10 minutes longer. If you want it even
  thicker, add more potatoes, which you can also blend separately and
  add in.  Serve hot, topped with parsley and seasoned croutons.  If
  desired, add additional uncooked broccoli and carrots to the bowl
  just before serving or heating up.
  
  Note: for my vegan daughter, I blended before adding the milk and put
  hers aside.  It was green soup!

      Title: LIGHT HOLLANDAISE
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 1/2 cups
 
      3 tb Lemon juice, fresh
      3 tb Water
    1/2 ts Salt
      3    Eggs
      6 oz Butter, unsalted
           -(more as needed)
 
  Melt the butter in a small saucepan.  It should be warm, but not
  bubbling hot. Combine the lemon juice and water in a small sauce pan.
  Bring to a simmer, adding the salt.
  
  Meanwhile, place one egg and the yolks of the other two in a smallish
  saucepan.  Vigorously beat the egg and yolks with a wire whip for a
  minute or so, until they are pale and thick.
  
  Set the yolk mixture over moderately low heat and whisk in the hot
  lemon juice by driblets. Continue whisking, not too fast, but
  reaching all over the bottom and corners of the pan, until you have a
  foamy warm mass. Remove from heat just as you see a wisp of steam
  rising. (Do not overheat or you will coagulate the egg yolks.)
  
  Immediately start beating in the warm butter by driblets, to make a
  thick, creamy, light yellow sauce. Taste carefully for seasoning,
  adding salt, pepper, and more lemon juice to taste.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick and easy Hollandaise sauce -- Few small things seem to
  impress dinner guests more than a good Hollandaise sauce. Perhaps
  this is because the guests think it is difficult to execute. This
  recipe disproves that notion; it makes it simple to produce a
  consistently good Hollandaise sauce.  Use it over asparagus, to dip
  artichokes, with steak and rice, or for anything you can imagine. The
  original recipe comes from Julia Child & Company.
  
  *  This sauce is really so easy to make, you should leave it to the
  last minute.  It doesn't keep terribly well. Any egg yolk and butter
  sauce can be kept only warm, not hot, or it will curdle. Also
  remember that sauces with egg yolks are prime breeding grounds for
  sick-making bacteria.
  
  *  Copper or stainless steel saucepans are best, as they transmit and
  hold heat better than anything else. I often make this solely in
  Corningware pots, and find that sometimes the sauce will not set
  after removing from heat and adding the butter. In this case, return
  the mixture to very low heat, whisking vigorously until the sauce
  achieves the desired thickness. Too much heat will either curdle the
  egg yolks or cause the butter to separate from the mixture.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  5 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  aside.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until
  smooth. Add 1 1/4 cups sugar, egg yolks, vanilla and salt. Beat until
  smooth. With mixer at low speed, gradually add yogurt and flour,
  beating until smooth. (Alternately, you can blend all ingredients in
  a food processor.)In a large clean mixing bowl and with clean
  beaters, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add
  remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, whipping until stiff but not dry peaks
  form. With a rubber spatula, fold the beaten whites into the cream
  cheese mixture.
  
  Turn batter into prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until the
  cheesecake is puffed and the top is pale golden and dry to the touch.
  Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door
  closed for 30 minutes. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let
  cool completely on a wire rack. Remove the springform pan sides.
  Refrigerate, loosely covered with plastic wrap, for at least 4 hours
  or up to 2 days.
  
  Shortly before serving, arrange strawberries over the cheesecake.

    3/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  (4.1 ounces) whole wheat

      2 tb Gluten flour
      2 ts Cornmeal
      1 ts Caraway seeds
  1 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
 
  So far, the best of my many bread machine cookbooks is 'The Complete
  Book of Bread Machine Baking' put out by Trillium Health Books; Lara
  Pizzorno, Editor.  I have used the [above] rye bread recipe with
  success. I usually make the tablespoons of gluten flour into
  'heaping' tablespoons to ensure good rising.
  
  Put the ingredients in the bread pan in the order listed. Reverse the
  order if the manual for your machine calls for dry ingredients first.
  Select Basic Wheat Cycle, Light setting (or the equivalent setting
  for you machine). Press Start
  
  **note: I usually use bread flour instead of the unbleached flour
  Also, most recipes in this book call for some amount of canola oil, I
  just leave it out.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Env active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
  3 1/4 c  Unbleached flour (approx.)

  With a wooden spoon, beat in 1 1/2 cups of the unbleached flour, the
  whole wheat flour, and the cornmeal. Beat vigorously for 1 minute.
  Cover with plastic wrap.  Set the sponge aside in a warm, draft-free
  place for 10 minutes.
  
  Stir in the salt and olive oil.  Add the remaining unbleached flour,
  1/2 cup at a time until you have a soft, kneadable dough.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead vigorously
  for 8 minutes, using sprinkles of flour to prevent sticking. You

  * - To cut won ton skins into rounds, use a 3" to 3 1/4" cookie
  cutter.
  =======================================================
  ============== ===
  1. Working with 1 skin at a time, put an equal amount chicken filling
  in each center, about 1 teaspoon.
  2. Moisten skin edge with egg white, fold over filling, align edges,
  and press to seal. Bring pointed ends together, overlapping; moisten
  ends with white and press to seal tortellini. As shaped, set on
  flour-dusted baking sheets in a single layer; keep tortellini and
  skins covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying. Repeat until all
  skins are filled. If made ahead, chill up to 4 hours, or freeze on
  baking sheets and package airtight to store.
  3. In 2 pans, each 5-6 quarts, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil
  over high heat. Drop 1/2 of the tortellini (unthawed, if frozen) into
  each pan. Cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite, 4-5 minutes
  (about 6 minutes, if frozen). If tortellini stick to each other or
  pan bottom, stir very gently 1 or 2 times. Reduce heat, as needed, to
  maintain a gentle simmer.
  4. Pour 1/3 of the sauce into a warm bowl. Gently drain tortellini;
  pour into bowl. Add remaining sauce. Top with cheese.
  
  *** CHICKEN-PROSCIUTTO FILLING ***
  1. Mince prosciutto. Bone and skin chicken breast; cut meat into 1/2"
  pieces.
  2. In 1 10-12" frying pan over high heat, combine onion and 1 cup
  chicken broth. Boil, uncovered, until liquid evaporates and onion
  starts to brown, about 12 minutes; stir often. To deglaze, add 1/3
  cup water and stir to release browned bits. Boil until browning
  begins again; deglaze with 1/3 cup water and boil dry. Add chicken
  and prosciutto; stir until chicken is no longer pink in center (cut
  to test), about 3 minutes.
  3. Coarsely grind in a food processor or mince. Mix with egg white,
  parmesan cheese, all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons chicken broth,
  nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste. If made ahead, cover and chill
  up to a day.
  
  *** LEAN CREAM SAUCE ***
  1. In a 10-12" frying pan, combine onion and 1 cup chicken broth.
  Boil, uncovered, on high heat until liquid evaporates and onion
  starts to brown, about 12 minutes; stir often.
  2. Deglaze as directed for chicken-prosciutto filling. Repeat until
  onion is browned. If made ahead, cover and chill up to a day. Mix
  into onions the cornstarch, nutmeg, milk, and 1/2 cup chicken broth;
  stir until boiling. Use hot.

  This is great stuff: Take a package of your favorite frozen berries
  (I use Cascadian Farms Organic), and zap 'em for 3 1/2 minutes in the
  microwave. Frozen berries literally fall apart once they're heated in
  this manner, so stir/mash them into a sauce with a fork. Add sugar or
  Equal to taste. This is great in combination with yogurt or ice cream
  as well. -

 Categories: Finnish, Meat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
  2 1/4 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
     12 tb Unsalted butter; chilled and
           -cut into 1/4-inch bits
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Sour cream
      1 tb Butter; soft

MMMMM------------------------MEAT FILLING-----------------------------
      4 tb Butter
    1/4 lb Fresh mushrooms; finely
           -chopped to yield 3/4 cup
           Meat*
    1/3 c  Onions; finely chopped
    1/4 c  Parsley; finely chopped
      1 c  Cheddar or swiss cheese;grat
    1/2 c  Milk
      1    Egg mixed w/2 tb milk
 
  * Use either 3 pounds finely ground meat (beef, pork, ham, lamb or
  veal or a combination of any of these), or 4 cups cooked ground or
  finely chopped meat
  
  Prepare the pastry: Sift the flour and salt together into a large
  chilled bowl. Drop the 1/4-inch bits of butter into the bowl. Working
  quickly, use your fingertips to rub the flour and butter together
  until they have the appearance of flakes of coarse meal. In a
  separate bowl, mix together the egg and sour cream and stir into this
  the flour-butter mixture, working with your fingers until you can
  gather the dough into a soft, pliable ball. Wrap in wax paper and
  refrigerate 1 hour. Cut the chilled dough in half and roll out each
  half to rectangles of 6 by 14 inches each, setting aside any scraps.
  
  Butter the bottom of a jelly-roll pan with 1 tablespoon of soft
  butter. Lift 1 sheet of the pastry over the rolling pin and unroll it
  into the pan, or drape the pastry over the rolling pin, lift it up
  and unfold it into the pan.
  
  Prepare the meat filling:
  
  Melt the 4 tablespoons of butter in a 10- to 12-inch skillet. When
  the foam subsides, add the chopped mushrooms and cook them over
  moderate heat, stirring frequently, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they
  are lightly colored. If you are using ground raw meat, add it to the
  skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 8 to 10 minutes,
  or until the meat loses its read color and any accumulated liquid in
  the pan cooks completely away. Scrape the meat mixture from the
  skillet (or the mushrooms and already cooked meat) into a large
  mixing bowl and stir in the chopped onions, parsley, cheese and milk.
  Now gather this meat mixture into a ball and place it in the center
  of the dough in the pan. With you hands, pat the meat into a narrow
  loaf extending across the center of the dough from one end to the
  other. Lift the second sheet of pastry over the pin and gently drape
  it on top of the meat loaf; press the edges of the 2 sheets together.
  Dip a pastry brush into the combined egg and milk mixture and moisten
  the edges of the dough. Press down on the edges all around the loaf
  with the back of a fork (the tines will seal the edges securely).
  Prick the top of the loaf in several places with a fork to allow
  steam to escape.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375'F. Gather together into a ball all of the
  excess scraps of dough and roll it out to a thin rectangle. With a
  pastry wheel or small, sharp knife, cut this dough into long, narrow
  strips. Brush the loaf with more of the egg and milk mixture and
  crisscross the pastry strips over the top of the loaf in an
  attractive pattern. Now brush the strips with the milk and egg
  mixture and set the jelly-roll pan in the center of the oven. Bake
  for 45 minutes, or until the loaf has turned a golden brown. Serve
  thick slices of the hot meat loaf, accompanied by a bowl of cold sour
  cream and a side dish of lingonberries.

      Title: LIHAPIIRAKKA
 Categories: Meats, Finnish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      3 oz Butter
      1 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Sugar
      3 c  Wheat flour
      1 oz Yeast cake
           -(or 1 package
           -of dried yeast)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lg Yellow onion
      1 lb Meat, ground
           -(mixed beef and pork)
      1 c  Cream
  1 1/4 c  Rice, cooked
           -(left-over rice is fine)
      1    Egg
           Salt and pepper
 
  MAKE THE DOUGH:  melt the butter and add milk.  Heat the mixture to
  100 degrees F.  Crumble the yeast into a bowl. Add the
  butter-and-milk mixture and whip it until the yeast as dissolved. Add
  sugar, salt and flour and stir until it becomes a dough. Cover the
  bowl and let rise in a warm place for about 40 minutes.
  
  While the dough rises, chop the onion into very small pieces and put
  in a large frying pan.  Add the ground meat immediately and saute for
  10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cooked rice and saute this
  mixture another 5 minutes. Add the cream, season to taste with salt
  and pepper, and turn off the heat. Let the frying pan stand on the
  stove, covered, until the dough is ready. Preheat the oven to 450
  degrees F.
  
  Roll out the dough so it fits in a 12x16 inch baking dish. Put the
  dough into the dish so that the dough covers the whole dish (this is
  the most difficult part; don't be discouraged if you have to roll out
  the dough again).
  
  Add the filling on top of the dough.  Whip the egg and spread it over
  the filling.  Bake it on the bottom rack in the oven for about 20
  minutes.
  
  When the pie has cooled off a bit; cut it into pieces that are about
  1 1/4 inches by 6 inches (the traditional size of lihapiirakka in
  Finland). Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Finnish meat pie -- This is an excellent-tasting stomach filler.
  My dear mother gave me this recipe when I moved away from home. She
  probably thought that it would give me that feeling of home. It does.
  I have tried it on my friends and it is always a hit. My mother is
  from Finland. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  While eating lihapiirakka, you can try the hard work of
  pronouncing its name.  Liha means meat and piirakka is just piirakka.
  The filling can of course be varied. Other traditional Finnish
  fillings for other piirakkas are blueberries (with some potato flour
  on top) and cottage cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the crust ingredients carefully.

 Categories: Mom's best, Jewish
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Boneless trimmed chuck steak
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
      1    Onion, chopped
    1/4 lb Beef liver
      2 lg Eggs
           Salt & pepper to taste
      2 c  Flour
      4 qt New York Penicillin or other
           -homemade chicken broth
 
  1.  Cook the chuck in water to cover over medium heat until tender,
  about 45 minutes. Drain the meat; set aside to cool to room temp.
  
  2. Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and
  liver and saute until the onions are soft and the liver is cooked
  through, 3-4 minutes each side. Drain off any excess oil from the
  liver and onions; set aside to cool to room temp.
  
  3. With a meat grinder or in a food processor, grind the liver and the
  chuck. Add 1 of the eggs, seasoned with salt and pepper, and process
  until well mixed.
  
  4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and 1/4 tsp. salt and
  make a well in the center. In a small bowl, whisk the remaining egg
  with 1/4 cup of water. Pour the egg mixture into the well of the dry
  ingredients and mix with a spoon until smooth. Turn out dough onto a
  floured board and knead until soft and silky, about 6 minutes. If the
  dough is too wet, dust with flour and knead it in. Divide the dough
  into 2 even balls. Let the dough rest for 1 to 2 hours.
  
  5. Roll the dough out, 1 ball at a time, 1/4 inch thick. Cut the
  dough into 3 to 3 1/2 inch squares. Arranging each square of dough
  with 1 corner pointing at you, take 1 tablespoon of the meat mix and
  put it on the top half of the dough. Moisten 2 sides of the dough
  with cool water and fold the bottom half up over the top, forming a
  triangle. Fold the 2 opposite edges together, pinching the dough so
  that the kreplach resembles a tortellini. Repeat with the remaining
  dough squares and filling. (You can freeze the kreplach at this point
  in freezer bags. They keep 2-3 months. Defrost in the refrigerator on
  a rack, so the bottoms don't get soggy!)
  
  6. Bring the broth to a boil in a large pot. Slide the kreplach into
  the boiling chicken broth and cook them through, about 5 minutes.
  Serve immediately.
  
  Makes 25-30 kreplach or serves 8.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Dried lima beans
           -Water for soaking, plus
      4 c  Water for cooking
      3 md Potatoes
      2 lg Carrots
      1 lg Onion; diced
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 ts Fennel seed
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Marjoram
      2    Garlic cloves
           -- finely chopped
      2 tb Water
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      4 oz Mushrooms; thinly sliced
      1 sm Bulb fennel; diced
      1    Bay leaf
      1 tb Tamari
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Pick over and wash lima beans, and soak them in water to cover at
  least 6 hours or overnight.  Drain off the soaking water and place
  the limas in a large stewpot with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then
  lower the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour.
  
  Scrub the potatoes and carrots.  Cut the potatoes in 1/2-inch dice.
  Cut the carrots in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 1/4-inch
  slices. Add the potatoes and carrots to the limas. While they are
  cooking, saute the onion in 1 tablespoon of oil until golden brown.
  
  Crush the fennel seed lightly in a mortar and add it along with the
  thyme, marjoram, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of water to the onion.

  mixture into the bean mixture and return the skillet to the burner.

  golden around the edges. Add the mushrooms to the stew, adding more
  water if necessary to keep the stew from sticking.

  minutes or until the fennel bulb is just tender. Add the lemon and

      Title: LIMA BEAN & LEEK SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Vegan, Beans, Jw, Tnt
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 c  Water
    1/3 c  Lentils
    1/3 c  Lima Beans
    1/3 c  Wild rice
      1 lg Leek
    1/4 c  Tomato sauce or Ketchup
      4 ds Hot sauce or more
      4 ds Fish sauce
      4 ds Soy sauce
      2    Chicken bouillon cubes
 
  This recipe would be vegan if the fish sauce and bouillon cubes are
  eliminated and vegetable bouillon and extra soy used in their place.
  I am sure it would taste even better with the addition of a good
  stewing chicken, but it was created from the materials on hand one
  weekend. The lentils are long cooked until they disintegrate to form
  a meaty looking and tasting stock, an effect that is enhanced by the
  tomato.
  
  Bring the water to a boil in a soup pot and add lentils; simmer
  covered 1/2 hr or more. Add the lima beans and cook another 1/2 hour.
  Add the rice and cook another 20 min. Add the chopped green portions
  of a large or 2 medium well washed leek[s] [They are sandy and there
  is always sand trapped in the outer leaves] and simmer 10 min. Add
  the sliced white portion of the leek and the remaining ingredients.
  Simmer 15 min and serve.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 24 Ounces
 
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
  2 1/2 ts Yeast
      2 c  Bread flour
  1 1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/4 c  Oats
    1/4 c  Corn meal
      3 tb Sugar
    1/2 tb Salt
      3 tb Lime peel, grated
  1 1/2 tb Oil
    3/4 c  Coconut, flaked
    1/2 c  Coconut milk, unsweetened
      1 c  Water
 
  Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
  order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
  push Start.
  
  In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.
  
  A big summer fruit salad tastes even better with the tropical taste
  of this light bread.  Slices are irresistible with nutted cream
  cheese or chicken salad.  Spread with a mashed ripe mango if you
  like, but eschew jam, which will hide the subtly sweet but tart taste
  of the loaf.

      Title: LIME COCONUT PIE
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Crust and topping:
    3/4 c  Sugar cookie or graham
      2 tb Cornmeal cracker crumbs
        pn Of salt
  2 1/4 c  Sweetened shredded coconut
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      4 lg Eggs,, separated
      1 tb Unsalted butter,, melted
      2 lg Egg yolks
           Lime curd:
      4 tb Unsalted butter,, melted
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
    3/4 c  Freshly squeezed lime juice
           Finely grated zest of 1 lime
 
  Combine the topping and crust ingredients. Press one half of the
  mixture into the bottom and sides of an ungreased 10-inch glass or
  ceramic pie plate, building up the sides to the top of the plate to
  form an edge. Reserve remaining mixture for the topping. To make the
  lime curd, combine the butter, lime juice, cornmeal, salt and 3/4 cup
  of the sugar in a large bowl over a pan of simmering water with the
  bottom not touching the water, and slowly cook, scraping the sides of
  the bowl and whisking occasionally, another 15 minutes, or until
  thickened. Cover with plastic and refrigerate. Stir the curd every 10
  minutes or so to cool evenly.
  
  Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites
  with the cream of tartar and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar until stiff
  and glossy. Gently fold half of the beaten whites into the cool lime
  curd to lighten. Then fold in the remaining whites and the lime zest.
  (This should be very gentle; it is okay for a few streaks of white to
  be showing.) Pour the filling into the pie shell and sprinkle on
  reserved topping evenly to cover. Gently press the sides in so the
  top 1/2 inch of the crust remains bare. Bake 45 minutes, or until the
  pie has risen and coconut is golden brown. The filling should be
  slightly cracked and firm when pressed in the center. Cool
  completely, cover with plastic and refrigerate 6 hours to chill
  thoroughly. Serve cold.

 Categories: Pies

MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Shortening; solid
      3 tb Cold butter in small pieces
      3 tb Cold water or a little more

MMMMM------------------------LIME FILLING-----------------------------
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
      4 lg Egg yolks
      1 tb Grated fresh lime peel
    1/2 c  Lime juice; fresh
  1 1/3 c  Water
      2 tb Butter

MMMMM-------------------COCONUT CREAM TOPPING------------------------
      3 tb Water; cold
      2 ts Unflavored gelatin
  8 1/2 oz Cream of coconut*
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Whipping cream
           Lime peel (garnish)**
 
  *not coconut milk
  
  **removed with vegetable peeler, cut in sticks
  
  To make pastry in food processor: process flour, shortening, and
  butter with short pulses until coarse crumbs form. Add water; process
  with short pulses just until water is blended. Remove blade, then
  dough. By hand: cut shortening and butter into flour in medium bowl
  with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Drizzle on
  water, 1 tb at a time, tossing mixture with fork until dough clumps
  together. Gather dough into ball, then press into disk. Wrap and
  refrigerate about 1 hour, until firm enough to roll.
  
  Preheat oven to 425 F.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface with
  lightly floured rolling pin to 13" circle. Line 9" pie plate with
  dough. Fold edge under to form rim. Crimp or flute rim. Prick bottom
  and sides of shell with fork at 1" intervals. Chill in freezer about
  10 minutes, until dough is very firm.
  
  Line chilled pastry with foil and weight with about 2 c dried beans
  or pie weights. Bake 15 minutes, until pastry is just set. Carefully
  lift foil with beans and remove. Bake pastry 8-12 minutes longer,
  until crust is golden brown. Remove to a wire rack. Pour beans into
  container, cover tightly, and save for future pies. (Do not cook.)
  
  Prepare Lime filling: Whisk sugar and cornstarch in medium saucepan.
  Whisk in egg yolks and lime juice until smooth. Stir in water and
  continue stirring over medium heat until mixture comes to a full
  boil, 5-8 minutes. Boil about 1 minute, stirring constantly, until
  filling is translucent and thick. Remove from heat. Add lime peel and
  butter; stir until butter melts. Pour hot filling into pie shell.
  Refrigerate 45-60 minutes, until cooled.
  
  Prepare Coconut cream topping: sprinkle gelatin on water in 2-quart
  saucepan and let stand 2 minutes to soften. Stir over medium heat with
  rubber spatula 1-2 minutes, until gelatin dissolves, liquid is clear,
  and no granules are visible.  Stir in cream of coconut and vanilla.
  
  Beat whipping cream in medium bowl with electric mixer until stiff
  peaks form when beaters are lifted. Set pan of topping mixture in
  larger bowl of ice. Stir with spatula, reaching in corners and
  scraping bottom of pan. Mixture will gel as it cools, about 3
  minutes. When thick enough to mound when dropped from spatula, remove
  from ice. Whisk 1/2 c beaten cream into topping mixture until smooth.
  With rubber spatula, fold in remaining whipped cream. (If necessary,
  return bowl to ice bath and continue gently folding until mixture is
  spreadable, but not firm.) Spoon topping on cooled filling, then
  spread to cover, swirling topping decoratively. Refrigerate at least
  2 hours, until firm enough to cut. Keeps up to 3 days, refrigerated.
  To serve, garnish with lime peel.

    1/2 ts Powdered ginger OR
      3 sl Fresh ginger
      3 c  Cooked brown rice OR
           Couscous
 
    Clean salmon; discard head.  Peel ginger and slice very thin. Wash
  and pat salmon dry.  Rub salmon with lime juice. Put ginger slices
  and lime peel inside cavity of fish. Sprinkle powdered ginger over
  exterior of fish. cover fish lightly with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate 2 hours.
    Soak twigs 30 in water 30 minutes; drain.
    Prepare smoker according to manufacturer's directions. Fill fire pan
  about three-quarters full of hardwood charcoal and heat coals. Arrange
  twigs over hot coals. Fill water pan about three-quarters full with
  hot water.  Add apple juice and ginger to water pan and place pan in
  smoker as aromatic.
    Unwrap salmon and place on sprayed grid.  cover quickly. smoke
  salmon about 3 hours or until fish flakes easily when prodded with
  fork. Skin will turn a smoky color.
    While smoking, remember not to remove lid of smoker more than is
  necessary because it allows heat and moisture to escape, which slows
  the smoking process. also, while using smoker, check every 30 minutes
  to see if hot water or coals have to be replenished. Be careful and
  use pot holders.
    Serve fish warm or cold with hot rice.
  
  NOTE:  A perfect way to store fresh ginger is to peel it, place it in
  a small jar, cover it with sherry, and refrigerate. The sherry adds
  flavor and body to the taste of the ginger.

      Title: LIME-PINE MARMALADE
 Categories: Condiments, Jams
      Yield: 7 Servings
 
      1    Grapefruit
      2    Limes
      1 lg Pineapple
           Approximately 5 cups water
           Approximately 5 cups sugar
           -(2 1/2 pounds)
      2 tb Freshly grated orange rind
 
  Makes about 7 half-pints. Wash and remove the seeds of the limes and
  the grapefruit and dice or put them through a meat grinder. Pare,
  core and chop the pineapple. Measure all the fruit including the
  juice, and add 1 1/2 cups of water for each cup of fruit; let this
  stand overnight. The next morning, simmer the fruit and water,
  uncovered, over low heat until the fruit is tender, about 1 hour.
  Measure the mixture again and add the orange rind and 1 cup of sugar
  for each cup of pulp. Cook over medium heat until sugar has
  dissolved, stirring constantly. Then cook over high heat until your
  jelly thermometer reads 220 - 222 F, or the syrup sheets (2 drops
  falling from the side of a spoon and forming 1 large drop). Ladle
  into hot, sterilized jars and seal immediately.
  
  To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe
  the rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all
  particles of food, seeds or spices. While contents are hot, cover
  with a 1/8-inch layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add
  another layer of melted paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to
  seal completely.

      Title: LIMPA
 Categories: Breads, Swedish
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      1 pk Yeast, dry
      1 ts Sugar, granulated
    1/2 c  ;Water, warm (100 F.)
      2 c  Beer; heated to lukewarm
    1/2 c  Honey; to 1/2 cup
      2 tb Butter; melted
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Cardamom, ground (opt)
      1 tb Caraway seeds; crushed, or
    3/4 ts Aniseed; crushed
      2 tb Orange peel, fresh or
           -candied; chopped
  2 1/2 c  Flour, rye
      3 c  Flour, unbleached
 
  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water in a large bowl and proof
  for five minutes.  Combine the beer, the honey (adjust for how sweet
  you like your bread) butter, and salt, and stir well. Add to the
  yeast mixture. Add the spices and orange peel.  Mix the flours, then
  add three cups of this mixture to the liquid and beat briskly. Cover
  with a tea towel, and let rise in a warm, dark place for about an
  hour. Stir down and add enough of the remaining flour to make a
  pretty stiff but still sticky dough. Turn out on a very well-floured
  board, and work the dough until it is smooth and elastic.  Add more
  flour to the board as needed. While the dough will not lose its
  tackiness completely it will smooth out a lot. Shape it into a ball,
  oil the surface, and place in an oiled bowl. Cover with the tea towel
  again and let rise a second time, about one hour. Punch down, shape
  into two balls, and put on a greased baking sheet sprinkled with
  cornmeal. Brush with melted butter, cover loosely with waxed paper,
  and refrigerate for three hours. Remove from the fridge and let sit
  on the counter, uncovered, for ten to fifteen minutes. Bake in a 375
  F. oven until the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom;
  about 40 to 45 minutes. Cool before slicing.

      1 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 ts Dill
           Oil to saute
      1 pk Lipton Golden Onion Soup Mix
 
  1. Heat the oil in a frying pan, preferably cast iron. Heat the oven
  to 300F. In a separate disk, add the beaten egg, and add a little
  milk to extend. In another dish, place the bread crumbs, garlic and
  dill.
  
  2. Dip the chops in the egg, then dredge through the crumb/spice
  mixture. Saute in hot oil on both sides until brown.
  
  3. Transfer to a large baking dish (which you should spray with a
  nonstick spray to make life easier when you clean it!). Sprinkle with
  the Golden Onion Soup mix and bake at 300F for 1 1/2 hours, covered.
  
  4. About 30 minutes before the meat is done, prepare Minute Rice
  according to instruction in a separate saucepan. Instead of using the
  water as directed, try using College Inn or Swanson Beef Broth (it
  gives the rice a GREAT flavor!). Once the rice is prepared, (it
  should take about 10 minutes), remove the meat from the oven, remove
  the chops from the baking pan, put the rice in the bottom of the
  baking dish, and put the chops back ontop of the rice. Bake uncovered
  for an additional 10 minutes at 400F.
  
  This is great with a vegetable and rolls. Don't forget the
  applesauce! Very filling.

 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Strong white bread flour
    1/4 oz Easy-blend yeast
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Ground allspice
      4 tb Sugar
      1 pn Salt
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
    1/4 lb Butter; melted
      8 tb Milk; warm
    1/2 lb Prunes; cut into
           - sultana-size pieces
      2 oz Currants
      2 oz Sultanas
 
  Using a food-mixer or processor or your hands, mix and knead all the
  ingredients except the dried fruits to a smooth and elastic dough.
  Cover and leave to rise until doubled in size - about 1 hour in a
  warm room.
  
      Knock back the risen dough and knead again briefly, gradually
  working in the dried fruits until evenly distributed. Divide the
  dough in two, shape and put into two small (1 lb) greased and lined
  loaf tins. Cover and leave to prove (rise) until puffy and light.
  
      Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5 for
  40-50 minutes.  Take the loaves out of the tins and return them to
  the oven for a further 10 minutes or so as necessary - the bread will
  sound hollow when tapped on the base if it is properly cooked. Makes
  2 small loaves.

      Title: LINGUINE TURKEY BOLOGNESE
 Categories: Pasta, Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      1    Celery stalk with leaves,
           -finely chopped
      1 md Carrot, finely chopped
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2 cl Garlic, finely chopped
  1 1/2 lb Ground turkey
      1 tb Dried oregano
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Half-and-half
      1 cn Plum tomatoes, crushed
           -slightly, with juices
           -(28 oz)
      2 tb Tomato paste
      1 c  Defatted chicken broth
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
      1 lb Cooked linguine
      2 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley,
           -for garnish
 
  To lighten a traditional Bolognese sauce, I substituted lean ground
  turkey for the more traditional ground beef. It's necessary to taste
  and adjust seasonings as you go along, since the flavor of turkey is
  not as strong as beef. I've added a generous amount of oregano and
  garlic for spice and sauteed the meat in extra-virgin olive oil for
  more flavor. Have patience with this sauce - the long, slow simmer is
  what makes it so delicious. Freshly grated Parmesan is perfect to
  serve alongside.
  
  1. Place oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the
  celery, carrot, onion and garlic, then cook 8-10 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  2. Raise heat to medium and add the ground turkey and oregano. Cook
  for about 8 minutes, stirring and breaking up the meat, until it
  begins to brown.
  
  3. Add the wine and simmer for about 10-12 minutes. Add the
  half-and-half and simmer until nearly reduced, about 6-8 minutes.
  
  4. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and broth. Bring to a gentle simmer
  and cook over medium-low heat, partially covered, for 1 hour,
  stirring a few times. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  5. Serve hot over just-cooked linguine and sprinkle with chopped
  parsley.

      Title: LINGUINE WITH AVOCADO PESTO
 Categories: Herbs, Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Linguine
      1 c  Chopped fresh basil packed
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley packed
      2 ts Crushed garlic
      1    Ripe avocado,peeled chopped
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 c  Parmensan cheese
      1 c  Chicken stock or water
      2 ts Lemon juice
      2 tb Toasted pine nuts
 
  1.  Cook pasta in boling water according to package instruction or
  until firm to bite.  Drain and place in serving bowl. 2. In food
  processor puree basil, parsley, garlic, avocado, oil, 2 tbsp of the
  Parmensan cheese, stock and lemon juice until smooth. Pour over
  pasta. Sprinkle with pine nuts and remaining Parmensan cheese. Toss.
  
  tips:  Even with lemon juice the pesto may discolour, if this
  happens, skim off the darkened surface and discard. Toast pine nuts
  in a skillet on stove top for 2 to 3 minutes until brown. This is
  like a guacamole dressing with much less fat due to the basil and
  parsley. For a stronger flavor use all basil and no parsley.

 Categories: Cheese, Main dishes, Pasta, Chicken, Poultry
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Basil, fresh -- minced
    1/4 c  Italian parsley -- coarsely
           Chopped
      5    Cloves garlic -- minced or

      1 lg Japanese eggplant --
           Quartered lengthwise
    1/3 c  Olive oil
    1/2 cn Pitted black olives --
           Halved -- optional
      4    Green onions -- minced --
           Optional
 
  Combine basil, parsley and garlic and set aside.  Cook the pasta al
  dente, and set aside in cooking water to stay hot. LIghtly oil and
  grill (med heat) chicken and eggplant till chicken is done and
  eggplant soft. Cut into bite sized pieces. Drain pasta well and toss
  with several drizzles of olive oil, to taste, and cheese. Add garlic
  and herbs and toss well. Add chicken, eggplant, tomatoes, olives and
  green onions (if used) and toss again. NOTE: This must be done
  quickly, so pasta stays hot, and cheese melts. Season to taste with
  s&p, and serve with more cheese if desired. I like this with the
  olives and green onions, Patty is a purist, and thinks that it
  complicates the dish unnecessarily.

  In a kettle bring the water to a boil with the clams and steam the
  clams, covered, checking them occasionally and transferring them as
  they open with a slotted spoon to a large bowl, for 3 to 8 minutes.
  Discard any unopened clams, strain the broth through a fine sieve
  into a large glass measure, and if necessary add enough water to
  measure a total of 1 1/2 cups. Discard the shells, rinse any clams
  that feel sandy, and chop the clams.
  
  Stir the cornstarch into the clam broth and stir in the soy sauce, the
  Scotch, the vinegar, and the sugar. In a wok or large heavy skillet
  heat the oil over moderately high heat until it just begins to smoke
  and in it stir-fry the gingerroot, the black beans, and the garlic
  for 30 seconds, or until the mixture is fragrant. Stir the cornstarch
  mixture, add it to the wok, stirring, and bring the sauce to a boil,
  stirring. Simmer the sauce, stirring, for 2 minutes and keep it warm.
  
  In a kettle of salted boiling water cook the linguine until it is al
  dente, drain it, and add it to the wok with the clams and the
  scallions. Cook the mixture over moderate heat, tossing the linguine,
  until it is heated through and the linguine is coated well with the

      6 oz Linguine, uncooked
      4 oz Button mushrooms
      4 oz Wild mushrooms
           -(shiitake, cremini
           -or oyster)

    1/2 lb Pasta (shells, penne,

      4 c  Assorted greens (escarole,
           Arugula, dandelion, chard)
           Salt & pepper
 
  Bake the potatoes in a 350F oven for 35-40 minutes, until tender but
  firm. Or steam them in water or vegetable stock to cover. If you
  steam them in vegetable stock, reserve it for the pasta sauce.  When
  cool enough to handle, cut the potatoes into 1-inch chunks. If you
  are including green beans, cook them in vegetable stock and
  immediately refresh in cold water. Drop the pasta into a large kettle
  of boiling salted water. Stir. Heat the 1/2 cup stock in a saute pan
  over moderate heat. Add the onions and cook, covered, until tender,
  about 10 minutes.  Add the garlic and optional hot red pepper flakes
  and cook 2 minutes longer. Add the tomatoes, tomato liquid, potatoes,
  and greens and optional beans and cook until the greens are wilted
  and the potatoes are heated through. Season with salt and pepper.
  When the pasta is al dente, drain it and toss with the sauce in a
  warmed bowl. Note:  Canned tomatoes can be substituted for fresh.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Recipe Egg Pasta (OR 3/4 Lb
           -dry linguine)
      2    Cloves garlic
      2 tb Fresh tarragon, chopped (2
           -tsp dried)
     30    Steamers or other small
           -clams (about 2 Lbs)
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/8 ts Red-pepper flakes
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  PREPARATION:  Make the Egg Pasta.  Roll as thin as possible and cut
  into 1/8-inch wide strips for linguine. Mince the garlic. Chop the
  tarragon. Scrub the clams, discarding any that have opened. Place
  clams and wine in a large pot; cook, covered, over medium-high heat,
  shaking occasionally, until all the clams have opened, about 6
  minutes. Remove pot from heat and allow clams to cool.  Remove clams
  from shells; if using steamers, pull off the black portion of the
  neck. Swish clams in the cooking liquid to remove any loose sand.
  Strain cooking liquid through cheesecloth or a coffee filter.  Chop
  clams and put them in a bowl with the strained cooking liquid.  Add 1
  tablespoon of the olive oil. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of the
  olive oil over low heat in a small saucepan. Add the garlic and cook
  until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the tarragon and red-pepper flakes
  and cook for 2 minutes more. Add the clams and cooking liquid, bring
  to a simmer, and remove saucepan from the heat. Season with salt and
  pepper.  NOTE:  Recipe can be made to this point several hours ahead.
  
  COOKING AND SERVING:  Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water until
  tender, about 3 minutes for fresh pasta. Meanwhile, reheat the clam
  sauce if made ahead.  Drain the pasta and return to the pot.  Toss
  linguine with the clam sauce and adjust the seasoning, if desired.
  Serve immediately.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      3    Shallots chopped
           - or green onions
      1 ts Grated lemon rind
    1/2 ts Red chili pepper flakes
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
     12 lg Shrimp or prawns
     12    Scallops
    1/2 c  White wine
      2 lb Mussels
     28 oz Tomatoes, canned
    1/4 c  Basil, fresh, shredded
      1 lb Linquini
 
  Serve pasta and sauce in a large bowl on the table and let people help
  themselves. Vary the seafood according to your tastes. If you prefer a
  vegetarian version, saute mushrooms and peppers instead of seafood
  and add into tomato sauce. Grated parmesan is traditionally not
  offered with seafood dishes. 1. In a large skillet, heat olive oil on
  medium-high heat. Add shallots and garlic. Saute for 1 minute or
  until softened slightly, then add lemon rind, parsley, shrimps and
  scallops. Saute together until shrimps just turn pink and scallops
  are translucent, about 1-2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon from
  skillet. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Add white wine to skillet,
  bring to boil and add mussels. Cover and steam mussels until they
  open, about 3 minutes. Remove mussels from skillet and reserve with
  shrimps and scallops. Discard any mussels that do not open. Remove
  mussel meats from half the mussels, leaving remainder in their
  shells. 3. Meanwhile drain tomatoes and chop, reserving juice. Add
  tomatoes, juice and chili flakes into skillet and bring to boil. Stir
  in 2TB basil and simmer for 10 minutes to combine flavours. Season
  with salt and pepper. Sauce can be made ahead to this point. 4. When
  ready to serve: bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta
  and cook until al dente, about 10-12 minutes. Drain well. 5. Return
  seafood to sauce, sprinkle with remaining basil then reheat. Toss
  with pasta and serve.

      2 tb Soya sauce
      3 tb Oil
  1 1/2 lb Coarsely shredded celery
           -cabbage (about 4-5 cups)
 
  1. Take your Chinese cleaver and coarsely dice pork. Dice water
  chestnuts and slices of onion. Place all together on a heavy duty
  meatboard. Mince with your Chinese cleaver until all three of the
  ingredients are blended together into a lump. (It takes 10-15 minutes
  of solid mincing to accomplish this.)
  
  2. Place minced meat into a bowl. Add salt, pepper, and soya sauce.
  Blend together and form into 4 large meatballs.
  
  3. Place oil in wok. Heat should be on medium. Heat oil for about 1
  minute. Add pork balls to wok and brown slowly on all sides, about 15
  minutes. Cover wok, reduce heat to low medium and cook pork balls a
  further 30 minutes, lifting cover up from wok from time to time to
  turn meatballs, so that they can be cooked through evenly.
  
  4. Lift meatballs from wok and reserve on platter. Add celery cabbage
  to wok. There should be some meat juice in the wok, about 1/2 cup or
  so. If there isn't any, add 1/4 cup water to celery cabbage. Stir fry
  about a minute, cover and cook a further 3 minutes, lifting cover
  once or twice to stir cabbage. Place cooked celery cabbage on serving
  platter. Arrange meatballs over cabbage.
  
  NOTE: Celery cabbage is a winter season vegetable. If it is not
  available in summer, regular cabbage can be substituted. Increase the
  cooking time of the regular cabbage to 7 1/2 minutes.

 Categories: Ethnic:, Chinese

        1 pk fresh chinese noodles
        1    chicken breast -- cut into

        1 TB soy sauce

  :          carrots -- julienned*
  :          shiitake mushrooms --
  :          julienned*
      1/3 c  soy sauce
        1 TB oyster sauce
        1 TB black bean paste**
        1 pn sugar
  
  * Optional **If possible, try to get the authentic kind sold in
  Chinese or Korean markets. These have the best flavor. But if all you
  can get a hold of is the supermarket variety, that's all right. Or it
  can be omitted altogether, if there is none to be had in your area.
  1. Cook the noodles in boiling water until done. Drain. 2. Marinade
  the meat in soy sauce, rice wine, and cornstartch for at least 30
  minutes. 3. In a measuring cup, mix together the soy sauce, oyster
  sauce, black bean paste, and sugar. Set aside. 4. Heat a large wok on
  high. When the wok is smoking add the oil. Stir fry the vegetables
  briefly, in batches if necessary, and transfer to a bowl. 5. Reheat
  the wok and add more oil. Add the marinated chicken and stir fry
  until the meat is cooked. Add the soy sauce mixture in step 3 and
  cook until boiling. 6. Add the noodles and vegetables to wok and toss
  well to coat. Take off the heat. Note: It is important to have a good
  heat source to achieve good results in chinese cooking. I have found
  that ordinary  kitchen stoves leave something to be desired when the
  recipe calls for stir frying over high heat. If possible, use an
  outdoor cooking device, such as propane gas stoves designed for
  outdoor cooking. (use it outdoors, of course!)

        1 c  onion -- chopped
      1/2 c  leek -- chopped
        1 c  celery -- thinly sliced

  :          minced
        2    cloves garlic -- minced or
  :          pressed
      1/2 ts fresh ginger -- minced
        1 lb smoked ham -- julienne cut
        2 c  cabbage -- finely shredded
        5 oz bamboo shoots (canned) --
  :          julienne cut
        3 TB sherry
        1 TB soy sauce
        1 TB cornstarch
        1 lb egg roll skins
        1    egg -- beaten
  :          oil
  
  Ashland is a picnic lover's haven, from beautiful Lithia Park
  adjacent to the Elizabethan Theater, to nearby streams, lakes and
  hillsides. Perfect pre-theater picnic fare would be this Chinese
  spring roll, with its succulent ham and vegetable filling all wrapped
  up and ready to go.
  
  Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan or wok. Add the
  onion, leek, celery, chile, garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for about 1
  minute, then add the ham, cabbage and bamboo shoots, and continue to
  stir-fry for an additional 3 or 4 minutes. Blend together the sherry;
  soy sauce and cornstarch. Stir the mixture into the vegetables and
  cook just until thickened. Do not overcook the ingredients or the
  vegetables will not be crunchy. Remove from heat, adjust seasonings
  and cool thoroughly before proceeding with recipe.
  
  For each spring roll, place an egg roll skin on counter, with a corner
  pointing toward you. Arrange about 2 rounded tablespoons of the
  filling diagonally across the skin, to within 1 inch of the left and
  right corners. Fold the corner nearest you over the filling. Brush a
  dot of beaten egg on the left and right corners, then fold these
  corners in over the filling, pressing them firmly down onto the
  previously folded corner. Now roll the package to within 1 inch of
  the top comer. Dot top corner with egg and press it down on the roll
  to seal. As each spring roll is completed, cover it with plastic wrap
  until ready to fry. Rolls can be refrigerated up to 12 hours before
  frying. Fry a few spring rolls at a time in about 2 inches of hot oil
  until golden, turning to evenly brown on all sides.
  
  After frying, drain well on paper towels and serve immediately, or
  refrigerate for later use.  Spring rolls are equally delicious hot or
  cold.
  
  Cooked spring rolls can also be covered and frozen. To reheat frozen
  rolls, place them on a baking sheet an bake in a 375 degree oven for
  about 20 minutes, or microwave on HIGH until heated through. Adapted

  all the other stuff. A dd mix-ins of your choice to some or all of

  in grape- nuts and bake at 350 degrees till done (10 to 15 minutes).
  
  Serve in a disposable cat litter box on a bed of grapenuts, with a cat
  litter scoop.  I hear you get lovely effects by decorating the box and
  scoop with melted chocolate or pudding.

 Categories: Breads, Dressings, Copycat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Tube 10 oz Pillsbury pizza
           Dough
      2 tb Butter
      1 ts Garlic salt
           Kraft 100% Grated Parmesan
           Cheese
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. 2.  Unroll the dough on a
  cutting board.  Position it lengthwise (longer from let to right than
  from top to bottom). With a sharp kinfe, cut the dough in half down
  the middle. Then cut each of those halves vertically  in half, and
  then in half once more so that you have 8 even strips of dough. 3.
  Being careful not to stretch the dough, place each strip on a lightly
  greased cookie sheet and bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the top
  just turns golden brown. 4. While the dough bakes, melt the butter
  (on the stove or in the microwave on high for 15 to 20 seconds), then
  add the garlic salt and stir until it dissolves. 5. Remove the
  browned dough from the oven and with a pastry brush or spoon spread a
  coating of garlic butter over each piece. 6. Sprinkle a generous
  amount of Parmesan cheese on each. Makes 8 pieces.

  cream into a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tube. Pipe a cream
  border around edge of cake. Decorate center of cake with 9 cream
  rosettes. Dip almonds into melted chocolate and place on top of
  rosettes. Refrigerate cake until serving. Cake can be prepared up to

  10-inch cake pan with a removable bottom; shake off excess flour.
  Melt butter in a small saucepan; cool slightly. Put eggs, sugar and
  vanilla in a large bowl. Set bowl in a larger one containing hot
  water or use a double boiler off the heat. Beat at high speed 10 to
  12 minutes or until mixture is pale and thick and has tripled in

  plastic wrap and stored at room temperature. CUSTARD CREAM: In a
  medium saucepan, bring milk just to a boil. Put egg yolks, sugar and
  vanilla into a medium bowl. Beat 2 to 3 minutes until mixture is pale
  and thick. Gradually beat in flour. Very slowly stir half the hot
  milk into yolk mixture. Pour mixture into pan containing remaining
  hot milk. Whisk over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes or until custard has
  a medium-thick consistency. Do not let mixture boil. Place custard in
  bowl. Cover and refrigerate. COFFEE ZABAGLIONE: In a large bowl or
  the top part of a double boiler, beat egg yolk and sugar until pale

  A rich, luscious dessert from the famous Il Cantoncino Restaurante in
  Bologona.
  
  Prepare Sponge Cake.  Prepare Custard Cream.  Prepare Coffee
  Zabaglione. Cream butter in a large bowl until pale and fluffy.
  Gradually add cooled zabaglione to butter, beating vigorously after
  each addition. Refrigerate mixture 2 to 3 minutes to stiffen
  slightly. Whip cream and refrigerate. Preheat oven to 200F (95C). Put
  chocolate into a small ovenproof bowl and place in oven until
  chocolate has melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Cut cake into 2 layers.
  Sprinkle rum over 2 cut surfaces of cake. Spread 1 layer with Custard
  Cream. Top with second layer. Spread zabaglione mixture evenly over
  top of cake.  Hold cake in 1 hand and spread zabaglione mixture
  around sides of cake. Gently press walnuts onto sides of cake. Put
  whipped cream into a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tube. Pipe
  a cream border around edge of cake. Decorate center of cake with 9
  cream rosettes. Dip almonds into melted chocolate and place on top of
  rosettes. Refrigerate cake until serving.  Cake can be prepared up to
  24 hours ahead. Let cake stand 30 minutes at room temperature before
  serving. Makes 8 to
       10    servings.
  
  SPONGE CAKE: Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Butter and flour a 10-inch
  cake pan with a removable bottom; shake off excess flour. Melt butter
  in a small saucepan; cool slightly.  Put eggs, sugar and vanilla in a
  large bowl. Set bowl in a larger one containing hot water or use a
  double boiler off the heat.  Beat at high speed 10 to 12 minutes or
  until mixture is pale and thick and has tripled in volume.  Sift
  flour over batter in several batches, gently folding in with a
  spatula after each addition. Gradually add cooled butter, folding
  gently until well blended. Pour batter into prepared pan.  Cook 20 to
  25 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center of cake comes
  out dry. Cool cake in pan 20 to 30 minutes, then transfer to a rack.
  Cake can be prepared 1 or 2 days ahead, covered with plastic wrap and
  stored at room temperature.
  
  CUSTARD CREAM: In a medium saucepan, bring milk just to a boil. Put
  egg yolks, sugar and vanilla into a medium bowl. Beat 2 to 3 minutes
  until mixture is pale and thick. Gradually beat in flour. Very slowly
  stir half the hot milk into yolk mixture. Pour mixture into pan
  containing remaining hot milk.  Whisk over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes
  or until custard has a medium-thick consistency. Do not let mixture
  boil. Place custard in bowl. Cover and refrigerate.
  
  COFFEE ZABAGLIONE: In a large bowl or the top part of a double
  boiler, beat egg yolk and sugar until pale and thick. Set bowl or top
  part of double boiler over simmering water; do not let water boil.
  Gradually add coffee, beating constantly. Continue beating until
  zabaglione has doubled in volume and is soft and fluffy, 4 to 6
  minutes. Remove from heat and set pan or bowl over a bowl full of ice
  water. Stir with a whisk until mixture has cooled.

      Title: LITTLE PARCELS OF TROUT
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Trout (8-9 oz ea cleaned wt)
    1/2 lb Courgettes
    1/2 lb Carrots
    1/4 lb Mangetout peas
  2 1/2 oz Butter
    1/2    Lemon
           Fresh mint & chives
 
  Cut the courgettes and carrots into matchstick shapes about 1 1/2
  inch long and less than 1/4 inch wide. Steam them, and the mangetout,
  but only briefly, not enough to tenderise them fully. Use kitchen
  paper to blot surface moisture from the partially cooked vegetables
  and set aside ot become cold. Season the softened butter with sea
  salt and black pepper. Beat in 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice and 1
  tablespoon or so each chopped chives and mint. Use some of the
  flavoured butter to grease sheets of greaseproof or bakewell paper.
  Clean and fillet the trout, remove any little bones and cut the flesh
  of each fish into four long strips. Lay three strips side by side
  down the centre of each sheet of buttered greaseproof paper. Dust
  with sea salt and grind some pepper over the fish. Add a squeeze of
  lemon butter.  Lay the mixed vegetables on top, spreading them thinly
  and seasoning with salt and pepper between layers. Dot with the rest
  of the butter and, finely, add a sprig or two of mint to each parcel.
  To close the parcels, first draw two sides of the paper up over the
  filling and fold into a double pleat on top.  Then "hem" the raw
  paper edges at the sides by turning them over twice, and secure with
  staples. The parcels should be fairly baggy. Put each parcel on to an
  oeuf sur le plat dish or space them out in large gratin dishes or on
  baking trays. Chill until about 1 1/2 hours before cooking, then
  bring back to room temperature. To cook, bake at 400 F (200 C) gas
  mark 6 for about 15 minutes. Let each person unwrap his or her parcel
  at table. Hand round bowls of new potatoes steamed in their skins,
  plain undressed watercress, and Hollandaise sauce so that everyone
  can help themselves.

      Title: LITTLE STICKY TOFFEE PUDDINGS WITH PECAN TOFF
 Categories: Puddings, Desserts, Holidays, Publication
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------FOR PUDDINGS-----------------------------
      3 oz Butter, at room temp
      5 oz Caster sugar
      2    Eggs, beaten
      6 oz Dates, chopped
      6 fl ;boiling water
    1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 ts Coffee essence(I would skip)
    3/4 ts Baking soda

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE SAUCE----------------------------
      6 oz Brown sugar
      4 oz Butter
      6 tb Double cream
      1 oz Pecans, chopped
 
  Preheat oven to 350~ F.  You will need eight 6 oz metal pudding
  basins or eight 3 inch ramekin dishes, lightly oiled with vegetable
  oil. A swiss roll tin and a baking sheet.
  
  Begin by putting the chopped dates in a bowl and pouring boiling
  water over them.  Then add vanilla, coffee essence and baking soda.
  Put to one side. Next in a large mixing bowl cream butter and sugar
  together, beating (preferrably with an electric hand whisk) until
  mixture is pale, light and fluffy.  Now gradually add beaten eggs a
  little at a time, beating well after each addition.  After that,
  carefully and lightly fold in the sifted flour using a metal spoon,
  then fold in date mixture including liquid. The mixture will look
  sloppy, but don't worry. That is perfectly correct and the slackness
  of the mixture is what makes the pudding so light. Now divide the
  mixture equally between the eight containers. Place them on a baking
  tray and bake in the centre of the oven for 25 minutes.
  
  Using a palette knife, slide it around each pudding and turn it out.
  If they have risen too high, you may have to cut a slice of the top
  so that they can sit evenly on the plate. Now place the puddings on a
  shallow, swiss roll type pan.
  
  Next, make the sauce by combining all the ingredients in a saucepan
  and heating very gently until sugar has melted and all the crystals
  dissolved.
  
  To serve puddings: Pre-heat broiler to its highest setting, and pour
  the sauce evenly over the puddings. Place the pan under the broiler
  so the tops are about 5 inches from the heat. Knock off any nuts on
  top to prevent them browning.  Let the puddings heat through for 8
  minutes. The tops will become brown and slightly crunchy and the
  sauce will be hot and bubbling. Serve with chilled pouring cream.
  
  Note:  After freezing, defrost, pour hot sauce over and reheat.

           FOR NOODLE DOUGH
      2 c  Sifted flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg, lightly bcaten
    1/4 c  Cold water
           FOR FILLING AND BROTH
      3    Eggs
    1/8 ts Saffron
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
           Pinch mace
     10    Cubebs, finely crushed

    1/8 ts Each cloves and nutmeg
    1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 lb Ground pork
    1/3 c  Currants
      6 c  Chicken or beef stock
 
  Richard II (1377-1399) Making homemade noodle dough takes some elbow
  grease, but taste rewards effort. The "won tons" are stuffed with
  spiced pork and currants, and make an unusual highlight for a simple
  broth. 1. Sift flour and salt together. 2. Make a small well in the
  center of the flour, and pour egg and water into it. 3. Combine all
  ingredients, mixing and kneading until a smooth, elastic dough is
  formed (about
       20    minutes). 4. Allow dough to sit for about 20 minutes. 5.
  Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out halves
  one at a time into sheets almost paper thin. Dough will be elastic,
  and much de- termination is required tn this process. ~our task will
  be eased by allowing a section of the dough leaf to hang over the
  table's side as you roll. 6. Cut each sheet of dough into about 10 or
  12 rsctangular pieces. **** For the Filling and Broth **** 1.Beat 2
  eggs, spices, and salt together. 2.Blend egg mixture, pork, and
  currants. 3.Place a teaspoon of stuffing on each piece of dough.
  4.Beat the third egg. Run this "paste" along the edges of each piece
  of dough. Fold dough over stuffing so edges meet. Seal by pressing
  edges together. 5.Bring stock to boil. Add tartlettes and any left-
  over stuffing, reducing heat to a gentle boil. 6.Cook about 10 to 12
  minutes or until noodle dough reaches consistency you enjoy in

      Title: LIVE HUMMUS
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Bag sprouted bean mix (1 3/4
           Cup)
      2    To 3 lemons juiced
      2    To 3 garlic cloves
      1    To 2 Tbsp. tamari soy sauce
    1/4    To 1/2 cup fresh organic
           Carrot juice
 
  Put all ingredients in a food processor or blender and blend until
  smooth. A blender may need a little more liquid to get a smooth
  texture.
  
  My variation: instead of the carrot juice, I grate 2 whole organic
  carrots in the food processor first, then add all the other
  ingredients and process until smooth.
  
  Great with whole wheat pita pockets.

    1/2 ts Pepper
      1 tb Celery salt
           GARNISH -----
           Crisp bacon pieces
 
  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot).
  
  Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
  Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
  servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
  served without freezing.
  
  Grease other shallow baking pans for cooking the liver. Place the
  liver slices in the pans.  Brush with melted fat. Brown in oven for
  20 minutes. Drain. Put liver through food chopper. Dissolve bouillon
  cubes in hot water.  Mix liver and bouillon with remaining
  ingredients. Press one-fourth of the mixture into each baking pan.
  Pack mixture tightly to avoid air pockets.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Bake
  45 minutes or until loaf is done in center. Garnish with bacon piece.
  
  TO FREEZE:  Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food.
  Put edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies
  directly on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and
  seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing,
  and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about
  6 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing
  packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN LOAF:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
  freezer wrap.  Place loaf in baking pan. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until
  loaf is done in center. Garnish with crisp bacon piece.

      5 lb Sugar
 
  At 1810 West Inn, what is billed as a continental breakfast can
  include individual quiches, small pastry-wrapped sausages, and
  biscuits with homemade preserves. The most colorful way of presenting
  this recipe is to use innkeeper Virginia Whites language. She advises
  that the preserves will be firmer if the pears are not too ripe.
  
  A 5-gallon bucket filled with pears from our backyard pear trees 5
  pounds of sugar. Peel, core, and slice the pears. Place in a large
  heavy pot with the sugar. Let sit overnight. The next day, cook the
  mixture in the same pot over very low heat, stirring frequently, for
  at least 6 hours. While hot, pack into hot sterile jars and seal.

 Categories: Fish, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 lb Fresh Salmon
      6 tb Butter
      3    Lemons
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Clean salmon and remove head, tail and fins. Cut the salmon into 1 lb
  steaks (not fillets). Place 1 salmon steak onto a sheet of foil,
  squeeze the juice of 1/2 a lemon, spread 1 tb of butter plus salt and
  pepper on the salmon. Wrap the salmon steak tightly in the foil
  (heavy duty) so as to make the best water tight seal as possible.
  Repeat for each steak. Boil the packages in water for 20 minutes.
  Remove and place in the freezer for an hour then refrigerate for 2
  hours. When ready to serve, unwrap the salmon steaks carefully on a
  large platter and cover with warm Hollandaise Sauce. To accompany the
  salmon, this dish should be served with new baby potatoes which have
  been boiled with mint leaves, and fresh garden peas, plus a palatable
  white wine. This is a very basic but absolutely delicious recipe. Of
  course, the fun is catching the salmon and telling the story of how
  the large one snapped the rod like a pretzel and "got away"!

  NOTE:  If unable to find Tamarind Concentrate, (Available in Indian or

  the local Georgian Sour Plum paste that is unavailable here.
  
  Combine the beans with the onion, carrot, and celery in a soup pot.
  Add enough water to cover the beans by 3-inches and bring to a boil.
  Add the salt, then reduce the heat to low, cover and cook the beans
  until tender but not mushy, about 55 minutes or more, depending on
  the beans. Meanwhile combine the prunes and the balsamic vinegar in a
  saucepan and simmer for about 15 minutes.  Remove the prunes with a
  slotted spoon and reserve the vinegar.  Finely chop the prunes. Add
  the tamarind concentrate to the vinegar and let stand until
  dissolved, about 10 minutes. Stir well and set aside.  Drain the
  beans and discard the onion, carrot, and celery. Place the beans in a
  serving dish and allow to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together the

      Title: LOBSTER IN TOMATO SAUCE WITH SAFFRON RICE
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Lobsters (about 2 lbs each)
           - (live, or recently dead)
     25    Saffron strands; soaked in
    1/4 c  Hot water
    1/4 lb Finely chopped onion
      1 md Leek; washed, finely chopped
      8 tb Fruity olive oil
      3    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 lb Tomatoes; skinned, seeded,
           - and finely chopped
      4    Sun-dried tomatoes (in oil)
           - pounded to a paste
    1/2 c  White wine
    1/4 c  Orange juice
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt & freshly ground Pepper
    1/2 c  Finely chopped Fennel
    1/2 c  Minced flat-leaf Parsley
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh Mint
           Saffron Rice
 
  If you have live lobsters, plunge them into a pan of boiling water
  for 1 minute, then into cold water.
  
  To prepare the lobsters, break off the claws and crack them open with
  a hammer.  Cut off the tip of the tail (with the fins), then sever
  the tail where it joins the head with a heavy knife. Cut the tail
  into rings, slicing through the shell between the ribs.
  
  Split the head open lengthwise with a hard blow of a knife and remove
  and discard the gritty stomach sac. Pour the coral (if any) and the
  green matter (which is the liver) into a stainer over a bowl,
  sprinkle with salt and pepper, and reserve.  Put the saffron to soak.
  
  In a heavy-bottomed pan big-enough to contain the lobsters and sauce,
  fry the onion and leek gently in 3 tablespoons olive oil until
  translucent. Add the garlic, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and
  liquid, wine, orange juice, and bay leaf.  Season and simmer,
  covered, for 15 minutes.
  
  Add the fennel, parsley, mint, saffron and liquid, and lobster tail
  pieces and claws with their shells (but not the legs) and simmer,
  covered, for 10 minutes.
  
  In the meantime push the coral and liver of the lobster through the
  strainer and beat the purie with the remaining olive oil. When the
  lobster has simmered for 10 minutes, ladle out about 1 cup sauce and
  beat this into the coral purie.  Pour this back into the pot, stir,
  and simmer for another 10 minutes. Serve with saffron rice.

  Chef: "Apply garlic salt and pepper generously on the lobster after
  you slice it in half and fry the lobster in lard for a couple of
  minutes. That's it. That's my big secret." Actually, Iraola, like
  most of the chefs and cooks in Puerto Nuevo, depends heavily on lard
  (not oil)... uses it for everything, even the rice. However, those
  who will notor cannot venture into this artery-clogging cuisine, can
  try *langosta al vapor* or steamed lobster, with what they call here
  the honeymooner's salad, "lettuce alone," with a little Italian
  dressing on the side.

      Title: LOBSTER TAILS INFO
 Categories: Hints/info
      Yield: 1 Info
 
      1    Information
 
  >I've never cooked lobster tails at home -- I can get rock lobster TT>
  tails, frozen, but I don't think I've ever seen real lobsters TT>
  except for fresh (sort of) in a tank, in markets around here.
  
  Virtually all the rock lobster that's available, except for coastal
  areas where it's caught fresh, is frozen anyway, so it doesn't much
  matter. Once the lobster is dead, the edible life span on the meat
  can be measured in hours, so they freeze 'em immediately for shipment.
  
  TT>  Your sources, of course, probably far exceed my sources, when it
  TT> comes to lobster tails.
  
  Unfortunately, no.  For some reason, management is more than a little
  stuffy about our dragging home samples
  :-)  I do drag home a dying Maine Lobster once in a while (if it
  looks like it's not gonna make it through the night). It's a mixed
  blessing, since the darn thing has to be cooked immediately, and I
  just can't get all that worked up about lobster at 1 o'clock in the
  morning.
  
  Actually, the frozen rock tails are pretty good, if they're prepped
  correctly and you don't overcook 'em. If you ever want to try, here's
  how:
  
  1.  Thaw the tails overnight in the refrigerator, or quick-thaw them
  under COLD running water.  At no time should the temperature of the
  lobster flesh exceed 40 degrees (F).
  
  2.  (NOTE:  the following directions are for right handed people
  only. Left handers should reverse the directions). Grasp the lobster
  tail in your left hand, with the fins pointing away from you, and the
  open (body) end pointing toward you. The top (rounded part) of the
  shell should be on top. If you have sensitive hands, you may wish to
  protect your hand with a towel, as the lobster barbs are sharp and
  can infect like crazy.
  
  3.  Carefully insert the blade of a pair of kitchen shears between the
  lobster meat and the uppermost shell, and make a lengthwise cut
  through the shell, stopping just at the point where the shell and
  fins meet. Do not cut into the fin area.
  
  4.  Use the shears or your fingers to cut through the shell at the
  point where the fins and the shell meat, so that you now have a "T-
  shaped" cut in the lobster shell.
  
  5.  Use your hands to pry the lobster out of the shell, leaving the
  portion at the top (where you cut the T) still attached to the shell.
  (Don't be afraid to get rough here -- the meat is pretty sturdy, and
  the shell is TOUGH.)
  
  6.  After the meat has been removed from the shell (but still
  attached at the top), flip it over (it will remain attached), and
  make 3-4 shallow (careful here, it's easy to get carried away and cut
  through everything) cuts at about a 45 degree angle through the tough
  membrane on the underside of the meat. (This prevents the cooked tail
  from curling.
  
  7.  Flip the tail over so that the meat is sitting directly over the
  cut shell.
  
  8.  Using a sharp knife and a gentle hand (again, you don't want to
  cut through the meat), Cut about halfway through the center of the
  tail. It should fall open. Now make two more shallow parallel cuts on
  either side of the center cut.
  
  9.  Finally, use your thumbs to press down on the shell at the fin end
  until it snaps, and fan out the fins for a pretty presentation.
  
  10.  Brush the tail with butter, season lightly with seafood
  seasoning or sweet paprika, and place it in a shallow ovenproof
  baking dish. (We use pie tins). Place about a quarter inch of water
  in the dish, and stick the whole thing under the broiler until the
  meat JUST turns opaque. Do not overcook or it will be tough, dry, and

      Title: LOBSTER TART
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------THE PASTRY------------------------------
      8 oz Flour
      3 oz Cold lard
      3 oz Cold butter
      3 tb Ice-cold water (or more)

MMMMM------------------------THE FILLING-----------------------------
      1    Live lobster *
      5    Eggs **
    1/2 pt Milk
    1/2 pt Single cream
 
  *Note: the lobster should be good and lively.  A "cripple" - that is,
  one with only one claw for which you should pay less - will do fine
  for this dish. ** Leave out one of the egg whites, it is not needed
  for this recipe.
  
  Make the pastry first.  Sieve the flour with the salt into a roomy
  bowl. Chop the lard and butter into the flour with a sharp knife.
  Finish rubbing in the fat to flour with the tips of your fingers.
  Work in enough ice-cold water to give you a ball of soft (but not
  sticky) dough. Cover with cling-film and leave the dough to rest in a
  cool place for half an hour or so.  Bring a panful of salted water to
  the boil - enough to swim the lobster.  Kill the lobster (or have you
  fishmonger do so) with a knife slipped in behind its head. Or plunge
  the creature in the boiling water and hold it under with a wooden
  spoon (lobsters do drown).
  
  Cook the lobster for 3-4 minutes - just long enough to turn the shell
  scarlet and make the lobster easier to skin. Drain it, sever the head
  and cut in half, taking care to save the greenish black brain (rather
  like liquid seaweed).  This will turn anything into which it is
  stirred wonderful sunny scarlet as it cooks. Reserve the brain for
  making lobster butter. Otherwise it can go into the tart filling.
  
  Remove the lobster meat from the body, claws and head (leave out the
  dark intestine which runs right down the body - and the stomach at
  the top of the head). Slice the body meat into medallions. Leave the
  claw meat whole.
  
  Bake the tart-case blind (lined with foil weighted with dried beans
  instead of filling) in a medium oven, 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5, for
  10 minutes.
  
  Beat the milk, cream and eggs together and season. Pour the mixture
  into the cooled tart tin.  Arrange the lobster pieces over all. Bake
  at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, until the egg-filling is
  set.

      Title: LOBSTER~ NORMANDY STYLE (HOMARD A LA NORMANDE
 Categories: Seafood, French
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Fresh lobsters, live
    1/2 c  Sweet butter
           Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Finely chopped shallots or
           -scallions
     12 c  Calvados
      3 c  Heavy cream
      3 tb All purpose flour
    1/2    Lemon, juice of
      1 ds Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Finely chopped fresh parsley
 
  Servings: 4
  
  Split the lobsters lengthwise with a big knife and break the shells
  off the claws with a hammer or a cleaver. Pour the liquid and the
  tomalley (the liver) into a small bowl. Discard the stomach (the
  small sac which is behind the eyes).
  
  Melt half the butter in a large, heavy saucepan. When the butter
  turns the color of a hazelnut, add the lobsters and sprinkle with
  salt and pepper. Cook over high heat for eight to 10 minutes, turning
  lobsters often. They should turn evenly red all over. Remove the
  lobsters from the saucepan. Arrange in a large roasting pan and place
  in a preheated 250-F oven to keep them warm and to finish cooking.
  
  Add the shallots to the saucepan and sizzle exactly 1 minute without
  burning. Add the Calvados, ignite, and when the flame dies out, add
  the cream. Work together the remaining butter and the flour. When the
  sauce starts boiling, add the flour mixture (beurre manie), bit by
  bit, whipping vigorously into the sauce with a wire whisk until
  smooth. Bring slowly to a boil. Then mix in the tomalley and lemon
  juice. Taste for seasoning and add salt and cayenne pepper, if
  necessary. You may cook a bit longer to reduce the sauce if you like
  it thicker. Stir in the parsley. Pour the sauce over the lobsters and
  serve piping hot.
  
  A rice pilaf is usually served with this dish, and we would recommend
  a chilled white Traminer wine or a bottle of old cider.

 Categories: Meats, Beverages
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------JUDI M. PHELPS----------------------------
      8    Boneless loin lamb chops;
           -cut 1-inch thick (about
           -2 lbs total), trimmed of
           -excess fat and tied
    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Fresh rosemary; minced
      1 lb Mushrooms; sliced 1/4-inch
           -thick
      1 lb Fresh spinach; stemmed and
           -rinsed
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
      3 tb Unsalted butter
 
  Preheat the broiler.  Rub the chops all over with 2 tablespoons of the
  olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the rosemary.
  Set the chops aside.
  
  In a large heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over high
  heat.  Add the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1/4
  teaspoon rosemary. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they are golden
  brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set
  aside.
  
  Broil the lamb chops about 5 inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes
  on each side, or until golden brown on the outside and rosy pink in
  the center.  Remove the string from each chop. Reheat the mushrooms
  briefly over moderate heat and arrange neatly down the center of a
  warmed serving platter.  Put the chops on top of the mushrooms.
  
  In the large nonreactive skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon
  olive oil over moderately high heat.  Add the spinach and the
  remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until wilted
  and tender but still bright green, about 4 minutes.  Spoon the
  spinach around the chops. Cover to keep warm.
  
  Add the wine to the pan and cook over high heat until it is reduced
  to 1/4 cup, about 4 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the
  butter. Pour over the chops and serve.

MMMMM-------------------LOIN OF LAMB EN CROUTE------------------------
      4    Lamb loins (6 oz each)
           - cleaned
      1 tb Olive oil
      1    Garlic clove
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Olive oil
      4    Sheets puff pastry
      2    Red bell peppers, roasted
           - peeled, seeded, and
           - cut into 1/2" strips

      1 c  Cooked spinach; drained
      1    Egg; beaten with water
      1 tb Water (to beat with egg)
 
  For Roasted Shallot Balsamic Vinegar Sauce:  In a medium saucepan
  place the beef stock and balsamic vinegar. Heat them on medium high
  for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced to 1/4. While
  stirring constantly, add the butter pieces one at a time, and whisk
  them in so that they are well incorporated. Add the roasted shallots,
  salt and pepper. Set aside while you prepare the lamb. Rub the lamb
  loins with the 1 tablespoon of olive oil and garlic clove. Sprinkle
  them with the salt and the pepper. In a heavy skillet place the 2
  tablespoons of olive oil and heat it on medium until it is hot.  Sear
  the lamb on both sides. Cut the puff pastry sheet so that it is the
  length of the lamb loin and 2-1/2 times as wide. Place the lamb in
  the center of the sheet. Top the lamb with the roasted peppers, feta
  cheese, and cooked spinach. Fold one end of the dough over the lamb.
  Brush the other side of the pastry with the egg wash and then fold it
  over on top of the other pastry end by 2". Cut off the extra dough
  and reserve it.  Crimp the open ends together with your fingers. Turn
  the wrapped lamb over.  Make a braid the length of the lamb with the
  left-over pastry dough. Brush the top of the dough with the egg wash
  and place the braid on top. Preheat the oven to 425øF.  Bake the
  wrapped lamb for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the dough is golden
  brown. Serve the baked lamb with the Roasted Shallot Balsamic Vinegar
  Sauce.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2    Swedish meatball recipe
      3 lg Onions; yellow (1/2 lb ea);
           -peeled
      3 tb Butter
      2 tb Fresh bread crumbs
 
  Place the peeled onions in a 2 or 3 quart pot, add enough cold water
  to cover and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Lower the heat and
  simmer the onions, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Remove them from the
  pot, drain and let cool on a platter while you make the meat stuffing
  (see recipe). Pull off each onion layer separately. They should slide
  off quite easily. Cut the largest outer layers of the onions in half,
  but remember to leave them large enough to enclose the stuffing.
  Discard the inner part of the onions (or use them for some other
  purpose) if the leaves are too small to stuff. Put a heaping teaspoon
  of the meat stuffing in the middle of each onion leaf and enclose it
  by folding over the edges of the leaf. At this poinnt they may be
  covered with plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days before
  cooking. Preheat oven to 400øF. In a shallow flameproof baking dish,
  melt 3 tablespoons of butter over low heat. Remove the dish from the
  heat and place the onion rolls, sealed side down, side by side in the
  butter, first rolling each in the butter to coat it. Bake 15 minutes,
  then baste with butter in the dish, sprinkle with bread crumbs and
  bake another 15 minutes until the onions are lightly browned and the
  crumbs crisp. Lkdolmar may be served as part of a smrgsbord or as
  a main dish.

 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Salt Salmon
      5    Large ripe tomatoes
      1    Medium yellow onion; chopped
      8    Green onions
 
  I usually scoop the tomato insides out with a large melon baller
  attempting to keep the outside shell of the tomato as intact as
  possible. Dice the removed insides and place the diced tomatoes and
  their shells in the refrigerator while proceeding with the recipe.
  Soak the salt salmon after cleaning. Change the soaking water
  occasionally to drain off most of the salt. After 3 to 5 hours of
  soaking remove all of the skin and the bones. Cut the salmon into
  small pieces and placed in a bowl. Add the diced tomatoes and also
  add the yellow onion which has been chopped into fairly small pieces.
  Cover the mixture with ice cubes until ready to serve. Chop the green
  onions very small and place them on top of the tomato mixture that
  you will place in the tomato shells to serve. Just as you serve the
  shells add a little crushed ice. FROM: THEODORE SEDGWICK (XPST31A)

      1/3 c  fresh lime juice
        2 TB olive oil
      1/2 ts hot pepper sesame oil -- (or
  :          to taste)
  :          Salt and freshly ground
  :          pepper
      1/4 c  fresh cilantro leaves --
  :          coarsely chopped
  :          Baked wonton skins (recipe
  :          follows)
  :          Garnish--
  :          Thinly sliced green onions
  :          toasted sesame seeds
  :          Tobiko cavair, if desired
  
  In a non-reactive bowl, combine the Ahi, cucumber, tomato, onion, lime
  juice, oils and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate and
  allow to marinate 30 minutes. Remove 20 minutes before serving and
  stir in cilantro. Serve on baked wontons garnished with green onions,
  sesame seeds and Tobiko, if desired. Yield: 8-10 servings as an
  appetizer
  
  This is based on an appetizer mixture served universally throughout
  Hawaii. Add/substitute whatever other fresh, seasonal crunchy
  vegetable you can find such as jicama, fresh water chestnuts,
  parsnips, etc.
  
  BAKED WONTONS:
  
  This is more a technique than a hard and fast recipe. Beat 4 egg
  whites with a tablespoon of water until frothy. With a pastry brush,
  lightly paint wonton skins with the mixture and arrange in a single
  layer on non-stick or parchment lined baking sheets and bake in a
  preheated 375 degree oven for 5-8 minutes or until wontons are
  lightly browned and crisp. You can sprinkle the brushed but unbaked
  wontons with sesame seed, Kosher salt, poppy seed or whatever to add
  interest. Store in airtight container for up to 3 days.

      Title: LONDON BROIL WITH HUNTER'S SAUCE
 Categories: Beef, Sauces, From cook4u, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Flank steak
      2 tb Peanut oil
           Salt and pepper
      3 tb Butter
           Hunter's sauce for serving
      3 tb Parsley, chopped
 
  1. Preheat a broiler rack with the broiler set on high. 2. Rub the
  flank steak on both sides with oil and salt and pepper. Use generous
  amount of black pepper. 3. Place the meat on the broiler rack, and
  let cook about 4-5 in. from the source of the heat. Broil about 3-5
  min. and turn the meat. Broil on the other side 3-5 min. Cooking time
  will depend on the desired degree of doneness. 4. Transfer the steak
  to warmed serving platter and dot with butter. Let the steak stand in
  a warm place about 5 min. to redistribute the internal juices of the
  meat. 5. Juices will accumulate around the steak as it stands. Add
  these to the hunter's sauce. Sprinkle the meat with chopped parsley
  and carve it on the diagonal. Serve with the sauce.
  
  For hunter's sauce, the quickest way is to take some mushrooms and
  slice them thin. Then saute in a tbsp of butter. Once done add to a
  can of brown gravy or a brown sauce and a few black peppercorns.

 Categories: Fish, Kooknet, Cyberealm
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
  2 1/2 lb Fish fillets
           Oil
    1/2 c  Beer
    1/2 c  Self-rising flour

MMMMM-------------------------THE BATTER------------------------------
    2/3 c  Beer
    1/3 c  Lemon juice
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Bisquick
    1/2 c  Self-rising flour
 
  THE BATTER: In a 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl, with wire whisk, whip 2/3
  cup beer, lemon juice, egg, Bisquick, and 1/2 cup self-rising flour
  together till smooth. Then let it stand ten minutes at room
  temperature before using.  Meanwhile place two soup or cereal bowls
  on counter near the stove so that you can work quickly in coating
  food and getting it into the hot oil.
  
  In one small bowl put 1/2 cup beer and into the other put 1/2 cup
  self-rising flour.  Have a cookie sheet on hand. Cover half of it with
  paper towels for draining the fried foods. The other half leave plain
  for drying the coated food before you dip it into batter.
  
  Allow 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 lbs. fish fillets to serve 4 people. Cut each
  fillet in half to resemble triangles. Dip 1 piece at a time, first
  into beer. Let excess drip off. Coat lightly then in the self-rising
  flour.
  
  Place floured pieces on cookie sheet to dry 2 or 3 minutes. Then spear
  piece with 3-tined fork or tip of sharp knife & coat in prepared
  batter...evenly but lightly, letting excess drip back into bowl of
  batter.
  
  Fry few pieces at a time in 385 to 400 degrees F oil, at least 2 1/2"
  to 3" deep in heavy saucepan or use electric fry pan with temperature
  control dial to regulate heat of oil.
  
  Allow about 3 or 4 minutes per side for each piece of batter-coated
  fish, turning once to brown other side. Remove from oil with tip of
  sharp knife. Drain on paper towel. Keep warm on cookie sheet in 300
  degree F oven till all pieces have been fried.
  
  SHRIMP-DEEP FRIED: Substitute large or jumbo shrimp preferably frozen,
  cooked, ready to serve shrimp, that have been completely thawed,
  following the Lone John Sliver recipe exactly, using the shrimp in
  place of the fish triangles.  Be sure to dip the shrimp 1st in the
  beer and then into the self-rising flour before coating in prepared
  batter. Fry as directed for fish in above recipe. 1 pound serves 4.

  Put all in a glass and stir and watch out. Not my idea of a way to
  consume alcohol (I would prefer too much wine or champagne <grin>),
  but I believe this was the recipe. Does taste close to iced tea
  though... ~-Michelle M. Bass
  
  My boyfriend is a "working manager" of a bar here... i.e., he
  bartends. He said to add these to the preceding ingredients:
  
  1/2 shot 151 Rum (in addition to the regular rum) 1/2 shot Triple Sec
  or Cointreau
  
  I only tried one of these... I agree with Michelle... at least with
  wine or champagne it requires a few hours of sipping before you pass
  out, instead of a few minutes <big GRIN>.
  
  BTW- I just asked Jim if he was sure that both 151 and regular rum
  were used, and why... he said "to hurt people". Good enough reason for

      Title: LONG JOHN SILVER'S BATTER-DIPPED FISH
 Categories: Fish, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Soybean oil
      2 lb Fresh cod fillets
  1 1/3 c  Self rising flour
      1 c  Water
      1    Egg
      2 ts Granulated sugar
      2 ts Salt
 
  1) Heat oil in a deep pan to 375 F. 2) Cut fish into wedges approx.
  7" x 2"(wide end) x 1 1/2" (narrow end) 3) With mixer, blend flour,
  water, egg, sugar, and salt. 4) Dip each fillet into the batter,
  coating generoursly, and quickly drop into the oil. 5) Fry each
  fillet until dark golden brown, about 5 min. 6) Remove from oil and
  place on paper towels or metal rack to drain.
  
  Yeild: 4 to 6 fish fillets
  
  Soybean oil is what your local Long John Silver's uses to fry their
  fish, and you will best duplicate the real thing by using the same
  oil. But any other oil may be substituted. You might want to try
  canola oil. It is the oil lowest in saturated fat, and the taste
  difference is only slight.
       It's crucial that your oil be hot before frying the fish. To
  test the temp., drip some batter into the oil. It should bubble
  rapidly. After 5 min., the test batter should become golden brown. If
  so, fry away, fish fiends.

 Categories: Filipino
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Mixture of 30% ground beef
           And 70% ground pork
           For every 2.2 pounds (1 kilo
           Mixture add:
  2 1/2 tb Salt
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Vinegar
      2 tb Wine
    1/8 ts Saltpeter; (salitre)
      1 ts Ground pepper
      2 ts Chopped garlic
           Sausage casings
           Available any butcher shop
 
   Mix all ingredients together and cure mixture for 5-6 days in the
  refrigerator and stuff into casings. This kind of sausage should be
  stored in a cooler, ready for use. To cook: Place a small amount of
  water in a skillet. Place sausages and let boil in water for about 10
  minutes. With a fork, pierce casings. The Longganisa will be ready
  when juices flow out and turn a dark caramel color. The sausages
  should also turn the same color and some oil should leak out.
  Suggestions: You can eat the Longganisa and tapa with pieces of
  lightly salted tomatoes. This will make a perfect compliment to the
  sinangag.

      1 c  Sugar
      2 c  Water
      3    Dried chili peppers 2 sl

      2    Cloves garlic, split
 
  Add all ingredients to saucepan and boil 15 minutes. Refrigerate
  sauce.
  
  Simmer foods in this sauce, as the foods absorb the salty taste, you
  may need to add more soy sauce to compensate.
  
  Do not use fish in this sauce if you want to keep it long.
  
  Basic Sauce is used over and over again to slow-simmer a number of
  foods. It imparts its own flavor to what is cooked, and grows more
  savory with the cooking of different foods.

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1 lb Confectioners' sugar
    1/4 c  Milk
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/4 lb Butter, softened
 
  Beat eggs until frothy; set aside.  In large bowl, add boiling water
  to shortening, sugar and salt.  Add 1 cup lukewarm water. In separate
  bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup lukewarm water. When first mixture is
  lukewarm, add yeast mixture.  Add flour until batter is beatable,
  then keep adding until you can barely handle sticky dough. Knead
  lightly to mix. Dough should be slightly sticky.  Put in well-greased
  bowl and cover loosely. Place in warm area to rise.  When dough has
  doubled in size and is very light, punch down and divide into 4 equal
  pieces. I usually make a half-batch of each kind.  To make crescent
  rolls, roll each piece to 10 inches in diameter.  Cut into 12
  pie-shaped pieces. Brush pieces with melted butter and roll up
  tightly, beginning at wide end. Seal points firmly.  Place on greased
  baking sheets, about 1 inch apart with points tucked under.  Let rise
  until doubled in bulk. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. While
  still warm, brush with melted butter. To make cinnamon rolls, brush 4
  pieces of dough with melted butter, then sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar
  mixture and raisins. Roll up jellyroll-style and cut each into 12
  pieces. Bake at 375 for 20 minutes. Glaze rolls while still hot.
  Makes 48 rolls. GLAZE: Combine ingredients and beat until smooth and
  pretty thin. Spread over hot rolls.

           A few sprigs of thyme and
           -rosemary
      1 ts Juniper berries
           Salt and pepper
    1/2    Bottle red wine (the
           -near-black wine of Cabors

  This is an unusual potted meat prepared only in the Languedoc.
  
  Serves 8 - 10
  
  Time:  Start at least 2 weeks ahead; 30 minutes plus 2 hours cooking,
  repeated 3 times
  
  First cooking: deep red Medoc)
  
  Second and third cooking: the same ingredients again each time
  
  You will need a large straight-sided earthenware pot. Scald the
  earthenware pot and grease it thoroughly with a little of the lard
  (you can line the bottom with a few fig or walnut leaves if you have
  them). Cut the beef and pork into slices, trimming the gristle and
  sinews as you do so. Put the bay leaves on the bottom of the pot. Lay
  in the meat slices, zseasoning with the herbs, salt, and freshly
  ground pepper as you do so. Pour in the wine - it should just cover
  the meat.
  
  Simmer the pot uncovered over a very low heat or in a preheated 250 F
  oven, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the volume is reduced by half.
  Allow to cool. Seal with a layer of lard, melted and poured over the
  cool meat. Cover with wax paper tied down with string.  Leave the pot
  on a refrigerator shelf for a week.  Then remove the lard seal and
  add in another 2 lbs pork and 2 lbs beef, the whole covered with
  wine, seasoned and cooked as before. Repeat the operation at the end
  of another week. You will now have a delicious dark jelly- meat which
  you can either eat hot or cold. If you continue to replace the volume
  you have removed, the pot can go on forever.

      Title: LOUBIA BIL LUZ
 Categories: Entrees, Algerian, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Green beans, fresh
      4 c  Water, salted
      3 tb Peanut oil
      1    Garlic clove, mashed
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Paprika
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 tb Almonds, slivered
 
  Clean and trim green beans.  Simmer in lightly salted water until just
  tender, about 30-45 minutes. Drain and put in serving dish.
  
  Put remaining ingredients (except almonds) in a saucepan over medium
  heat and cook for two minutes, stirring constantly. Add the almonds
  and stir briefly to coat. Pour the oil mixture over the green beans
  and toss gently until beans are thoroughly coated. Serve warm.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Algerian green beans with almonds -- This is a variation on an
  Algerian recipe from Rose Dosti's "Middle Eastern Cooking." Since
  when is North Africa in the Middle East? You may well ask.
  
  *  Canned green beans are not an acceptable substitute in this recipe.
  Powdered garlic is probably OK.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 50 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  1 1/2 c  Cornmeal -- stone ground
      3 tb Flour
      2 tb Sugar
      3 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking soda

  Preheat the oven to 350F. Combine the dry ingredients and stir in the
  wet. Pour the mixture into a lightly buttered 8" square pan and bake
  for 40 minutes, checking after 30. This is a dense, chewy cornbread
  and serves 6 to 8. Again, substitutions can be made: skim buttermilk,
  Egg Beaters, and butter substitutes for the dripping and to grease
  the pan. Do try to find stone ground cornmeal, though. It gives the
  cornbread a wonderful flavor and texture. The batter may also be
  fried in a large pan on to p of the stove, flipping it over so both
  sides are crunchy.

      Title: LOUISIANA CHICKEN STEW
 Categories: Stews
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      2 lg Whole chicken breasts (about
           -3 pounds), skin on, cut
           -into 8 pieces (you may use
           -boned breasts)
     12    Chicken thighs (about 4 lb)
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
  1 1/2 c  Coarsely chopped onion
      2 c  Coarsely chopped celery
      2 md Green bell peppers, coarsely
           -chopped
      1 cn Tomatoes, coarsely chopped,
           -with juice (32 oz)
      4 tb Tomato paste
      1 ts Hot pepper sauce, to taste
      4 c  Chicken broth or stock
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      2 lg Bay leaves
      2 lg Garlic cloves, minced
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/4 lb Precooked, coarsely chopped
           -andouille sausage or other
           -spicy garlic sausage
 
  NOTE: This tasty stew will reward you for the time it takes to make a
  proper roux, which add depth.
  
  Heat the oil in a deep skillet or Dutch oven. Working in small
  batches over medium-high heat, brown the chicken pieces on all sides
  (skin side down first). With thongs, remove each browned batch to a
  platter.
  
  After all the chicken is browned, make a New Orleans-style roux; Pour
  the remaining oil form the Dutch oven into a measuring cup. Return
  1/4 cup to the Dutch oven and heat over medium heat. Add the flour
  and stir, scraping flour from the bottom of the pan as it slowly
  browns. Stir constantly until the roux is a rich brown, the color of
  a paper bag. (Be careful: When a roux begins to brown, it can burn
  very quickly and will continue to cook, even off the heat, until
  liquid is added.) This will take about 20 minutes.
  
  Immediately stir in the onions, celery and peppers. Cook until wilted,
  about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, lemon juice, hot
  pepper sauce, bay leaves, broth, garlic, salt and pepper. Bring to a
  simmer
  
  Remove the skin and visible fat from the chicken. Return to the pan.
  Simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes. Add the sausage. Skim off
  fat as it collects on top of the sauce. Cook another 30 minutes, or
  until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thick.
  
  TO SERVE AFTER FREEZING: Thaw as recommended. Reheat slowly in a
  covered pot over medium-low heat. Serve in shallow soup dishes over
  freshly cooked white rice. Serves 12.

      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      1 lb Lean pork shoulder, ground
    1/2 lb Fresh pork rind
           -- boiled for 2 hours,
           -- drained, and ground
    1/2 lb Pork fatback, ground
      1 ts Salt
      1    Navel orange
           -- grated rind only
      1 ts Crushed dried marjoram
           -OR- thyme
      1    Bay leaf; ground in a mortar
    1/3 c  Dry red wine
      1 ts Ground allspice or coriander
           -OR- both
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
           Sausage casing
 
  Grind the pork, pork rind, and fatback through the fine blade of a
  meat chopper.  Combine in a large bowl with all the seasonings. Knead
  thoroughly.  Store in the refrigerator while you prepare the casing.
  
  Ususally salted, the casing (pork intestine) especially the interior,
  must be rinsed under cold running water several times. (To avoid
  losing casing down the drain while doing this, be sure the casing is
  inside a very large pan!)  Allow to drain on a linen towel.
  
  Use a pastry bag to force the stuffing into the casing. Pinch at
  3-1/2 to 4 inch intervals allowing space between to form the sausage
  links. Normally the casing will not break, but if it does, that
  section must be discarded and a knot tied in the new "end". To cook,
  poach in water for 1 hour, then drain, discarding the cooking water.
  Fry the sausages in a frying pan over moderate heat, or use as
  suggested in any recipe. Drain and serve hot.
  
  Note: To store, freeze uncooked in meal-sized batches. The sausages
  should be used within a day or two if not frozen.

 Categories: Soups/stews
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 oz Finely chopped onion
     10 oz Corsely grated raw potato
           Fresh young lovage leaves
  1 1/4 pt Chicken or vegetable stock
    1/2 pt Buttermilk, more if desired
 
  Put the onion into a heavy-based saucepan.  Add the stock and bring to
  boiling point very slowly so the onion begins to soften a little.
  
  Meanwhile coarsely chop a small handful (5 or so tablespoons) of
  lovage. Add the potato and herbs to the pan and pour on 1/2 pint
  buttermilk. Increase the heat very slightly and bring the mixture to
  a bare simmer. Stir vigorously all the while as the potato starch
  will thicken the soup, which may stick to the pan base. Half-cover
  the pan and reduce heat as low as possible once again.  Cook very
  gently indeed, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are
  perfectly tender.
  
  Whizz the contents of the pan to a smooth puree. Season with salt and
  pepper and with extra lovage if you like. Whizz again and thin to
  taste with a little more stock or buttermilk. Reheat gently or chill
  thoroughly before serving, then garnish with a swirl of buttermilk
  and a small flotilla of chopped fresh lovage.

  NOTE: You can garnish the greens to reflect your own intentions by
  combining common ingredients in an unusual way. A creative
  arrangement of olives and carrots could be mildly fliratious--or
  boldly suggestive, depending on how you slice them! Compose your
  salad to best express your desires, but keep it simple and make your
  own dressing, if possible. This recipe is a basic honey-lemon
  dressing whose variety is almost endless. Source: Cooking In The

      Title: LOVE IN DISGUISE
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Pigs' hearts
      1 sm Onion
      4 oz Fresh breadcrumbs
           Bay leaves
           Parsley
      2    Lemons (zest only)
      1    Egg; beaten with milk
      2 tb Milk; to beat with egg
      2 ts Wine vinegar
           French mustard
     15 oz Canned tomatoes
           A little stock
      2 oz Butter
      1 oz Well-seasoned flour
           Few spoonfuls yoghurt (opt.)
 
  You may get 2 or 3 large hearts for this weight or several smaller
  ones. Whatever the size, they will be slashed; this is normal. Wash
  the hearts and trim away waste - fat, membrane, gristle and arteries.
  Soak in lightly salted water for 10 minutes then rinse, drain and dry
  well. Chop the onion finely and soften it in 1 oz butter. Away from
  the heat stir in the breadcrumbs, lemon zest, 4 tablespoons parsley
  and lots of salt and pepper. Bind with the egg and milk. Use the
  mixture to stuff the heart cavities, and secure the openings with
  toothpicks or cocktail sticks ~ there is no need to make perfect
  closures.
  
  Whizz the tomatoes in a blender, stir in the vinegar and add enough
  stock to make up to 1 pint.  Dust the hearts thoroughly with the
  well-seasoned flour.  Melt 1 oz butter in a flameproof casserole,
  stir in the leftover flour and let it brown a little.  Blend in the
  tomato mixture and make a smooth, bubbling hot sauce. Lay the
  prepared hearts in the sauce and tuck the bay leaves among them.
  Cover with greaseproof paper and the lid, and cook at 325 F (160 C)
  gas mark 3 for 1 hour. Turn the hearts gently and continue cooking
  for 1 to 1-1/2 hours more until meat is beautifully tender.
  
  Transfer the hearts to a warmed serving dish.  Stir the mustard into
  the sauce, add salt and pepper to taste - and carefully blend in the
  yoghurt if liked. Pour the sauce over the hearts, scatter lavishly
  with chopped parsley and serve with boiled potatoes or noodles.
