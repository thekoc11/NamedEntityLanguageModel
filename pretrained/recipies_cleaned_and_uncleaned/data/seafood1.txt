Fish A La Lyle

fish

3  eggs
1  splash of milk
1 pkg golden dipt breading mix
4 cup bread crumbs
1  garlic powder, salt and pepper to t; aste
1  vegetable oil to fry
4  fillets of fish (perch, walleye pik; e, etc)

"Here's my quick and dirty recipe to cook fresh fillets...

Soak your fish in a pan of milk first, overnight if you have time.

Mix the eggs in a bowl with just a splash of milk. Mix in equal
portions Golden Dipt Fish Style breading and 4 cups of bread crumbs.
Note -- do NOT read the Golden Dipt box, mix it dry with the bread
crumbs.

Add garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste. For older men (Pat) use
more garlic powder... this really does help (g).

Put about 3/4 inch of oil in a frying pan and heat for about 10
minutes on medium/high or until water sizzles when splashed in the
grease (carefully).

Take your fillets from the pan of milk and dip it in the egg/milk
mixture. Then take it from there to the dry batter and make sure that
the entire fillet gets a good coating. Place it in the pan of hot oil
until golden brown. After you have repeated the process for all of
the fillets, eat your heart out!!"

Fish Broth With Oysters & Saffron

seafood, soups

1/4 cup butter, unsalted
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 1/2  carrots ***
3  celery ***
2 small leeks ***
6  parsley stems
2  garlic, cloves, crushed, - peeled
2  bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon juniper, berries
1 large tomato, cut into wedges
3 lb bones, fish, and trimmings
1 cup wine, white, dry
6 cup water, cold (approximately)
1/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
4  clams
8  oysters, shucked
1 oz mung bean threads **
8  radicchio leaves
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads

** Soak the mung bean threads (also called cellophane noodles)
in hot water for twenty minutes. Drain, and cut into 2-inch lengths.
Set aside.

*** Split the carrots, celery and leeks lengthwise in half.
Clean, peel, and slice the vegetables into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

Melt the butter in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the
onions, carrots, leeks, parsley, garlic, bay leaves and juniper
berries, tossing the mixture well to coat with butter. When the
vegetables begin to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium low and cover.
Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Add the tomato to the stockpot and stir for 1 minute. Add the
fish bones and trimmings and white wine. Cook this mixture for 5
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add cold water to cover and raise
heat to medium high.  Bring to a boil, skimming all of the froth from
the surface as it forms.  Immediately lower heat and simmer gently,
uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes.  Strain the mixture, pressing the
solids firmly to extract all liquid.  Discard the solids. Add salt to
taste.

Heat 4 cups fish broth in a saucepan.  Steam clams separately in
small amount of broth just until shells open, removing each shell as
it opens. Transfer to 4 warm soup bowls; strain clam broth into warm
fish broth, avoiding any grit at the bottom.

Add oysters to fish broth and cook gently over low heat,
uncovered, just until edges curl, about 1 minute. Place 2 oysters in
each bowl. Ladle warm broth into bowls and add 2 tablespoons mung
bean threads. Add radicchio leaves and saffron and serve.

Fish Brown Sauce

cajun, fish, sauces

      ----SEASONING MIX----
1  whole bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
      ----MAIN INGREDIENTS----
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 cup finely chopped onions
4 teaspoon canned tomatoe sauce
1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
2 cup hot basic seafood stock
2 tablespoon burgundy wine
2 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened

Serve this delicious sauce over broiled, fried or baked fish fillets
or broiled, fried or baked oysters.
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set
aside. Heat the oil in a heavy 1-quart saucepan over high heat just
until the oil starts to smoke, about 1 to 2 minutes. With a metal
whisk, mix in 2 tablespoons of the flour, whisking constantly and
scraping pan bottom well, until the roux is dark red-brown to black,
about 2 minutes, being careful not to let it scorch or splash on your
skin. (Remove from heat momentarily if it is browing too fast for you
to control, continuing to stir constantly.)  Immediately whisk in the
onions; reduce heat to low and continue stirring and cooking about 1
minute. Add the tomato sauce and stir and cook 1 minute.  Then stir
in the seasoning mix and the Worcestershire (the mixture should now
be thick and dark red-brown); cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring
constantly.  Add the stock; turn heat to high and bring to a boil,
stirring often.
Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook about 6 to 8 minutes,
stirring often.  Stir in 1 tablespoon of the burgundy and remove from
heat. In a small bowl mix the butter and remaining 1 tablespoon flour
until creamy. Return sauce to low heat; gradually add the butter
mixture to the sauce, whisking until well blended each time. Return
sauce to a simmer and simmer 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add the
remaining 1 tablespoon burgundy. Remove from heat and discard bay
leaf. Serve immediately. From Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen"

(Depends on the fish) Wing it. 3/4 cup herbed wine sauce (recipe
follows) 1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees 2. Cut parchment paper
into 4 pieces about 10 to 12" square, same with foil, and I'm not
sure about the banana leaves. Any of these would surely work. 3.
Place 1/2 cup of the cooked rice in the middle of any of the above.
Top each serving with 1/2 cup of zucchini strips, a piece of the
fish, 1/4 cup diced tomato and 3 thin strips of the chile. 4.
Sprinkle a fourth of the chopped olives on each serving, and top with
1/4 each of the fresh herbs. 5. Seal any of the above wrappings the
best you can. String, holding the parchment together with egg, etc.
Now........ HERBED WINE SAUCE 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped onions 3
cloves garlic very finely chopped 1 tablespoon fresh thyme 1/4 cup
fresh chopped tarragon 1 cup dry white wine 3 tablespoon light virgin
olive oil 2 thin strip of the chile 1. Combine all the ingredients
except the oil and the chile in a blender and puree. Pour into a
small saucepan and bring to boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low
and simmer until the sauce is reduced by half. 2. Strain the reduced
sauce, pressing all the liquid out. Slowly whisk in the olive oil
until smooth. 3. Chop the strip of chile very tiny and add to the
sauce. (Sauce could be made ahead and reheated just before serving)
To serve, place each packet on a plate, open the packet and put 3
tablspoons of the sauce over the top.

Fish Citrus Salad

fish, main dish, salads

      ----SALAD----
1 lb large fish fillets; such as salmon, halibut o
1  white wine
1 large onion; sliced and separated into
4 medium oranges; or
2  grapefruit
2 medium avocados
      ----DRESSING----
1/3 cup olive oil
1/4 cup grapefruit juice
1 teaspoon mustard
1  salt
1  ground pepper

Cut the fish fillets into 3/4" cubes. Poach the fish in the white wine
along with the onion slices for about 8 minutes. Let them cool in the
liquid, then strain it off.

Peel the oranges and slice thinly crosswise. Remove the seeds. For
grapefruit, peel and section, then cut the sections into 2 or 3
pieces. Peel the avocados and cut into cubes. Toss the avocado in a
bit of the grapefruit juice.

To make the dressing, blend the oil, juice, and mustard. Salt and
pepper to taste.

To serve the salad family-style, toss the ingredients with the
dressing and serve. For a fancier presentation, line the bottom of a
salad plate with overlapping slices of orange, surround it with
avocado cubes and pile the fish cubes in the center. Drape the onions
over the fish and drizzle with the salad dressing.

Fish Fillets With Tomatoes Capers & Olives

fish

1  stephen ceideburg
1 1/2 lb fish fillets *
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
45 oz good-quality tomatoes, lightly drai; ned
2  cloves garlic, minced
12  meaty green olives, pitted and coar; sely chopped
2 tablespoon large spanish capers
2 medium pickled jalapeno chilies, sliced pl; us:
1 tablespoon pickling juices
3/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
2 tablespoon finely chopped parsley **
3  bay leaves
1  one-inch cinnamon stick
2  whole cloves
1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns, cracked
1  fish broth, bottled clam juice or w; ater salt (opt)

* like boneless and skinless red snapper or halibut, in 6 1 1/2-inch
thick piece. ** plus a few sprigs for garnish

Rinse fillets, place them in a non aluminum dish and sprinkle them
with lime juice and salt. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. In a
large nonstick skillet, heat oils over medium heat, add onions and
cook, stirring frequently, until golden, about 5 to 7 minutes.

Cut tomatoes into 1 inch pieces and place them in a bowl, collecting
the juices as you go.

Add garlic to onion and cook for a minute or so, then add tomatoes.
Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until most of the liquid has
evaporated. Divide olives and capers between two small bowls and set
one aside to use for garnishes. To the other bowl, add jalapenos,
pickling juice, marjoram, thyme and chopped parsley. If you don't
want bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves and pepper in the finished sauce,
wrap them in cheesecloth and tie with a string, otherwise add them
directly to the olive mixture.

Add the olive-herb mixture to the tomatoes, along with fish stock,
clam ice or water. Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes, then taste,
adding salt if necessary. Remove the cheesecloth bag, if using, and
the bay leaves.

Remove fillets from marinade and rinse. To cook on the stovetop,
place them in the skillet, covering them well with sauce. Cover and
cook over medium heat for 4 minutes. Turn the fillets over, cover and
cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer, until they flake when pressed firmly
with a fork at the thickest part.

Alternatively, to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place the
fillets in a single layer in a lightly oiled baking dish. Spoon the
sauce over them, cover with aluminum foil and bake for 10 to 15
minutes, or just until the fish flakes when pressed firmly with a
fork at the thickest part. Serve garnished with reserved olives,
capers and parsley.

Fish In Hot Fanny Sauce

fish

4 tablespoon butter, unsalted
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon tabasco sauce
1 teaspoon black pepper, ground
1 teaspoon white pepper, ground
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon oregano
1/4 cup onion, minced
3  garlic cloves, in thin slices
1 tablespoon pecans, chopped fine
1/4 cup pecans, sliced
2 teaspoon lemon juice
2  fish steaks or tournedos, cut about; 1 inch thick)

Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet, add onions, garlic, peppers,
paprika and diced pecans. Cook over medium heat until onions are
clear. Add Tabasco sauce.

Turn heat to high, add sliced pecans and fish pieces cut about 1 inch
thick. Cook on high 4-5 minutes per side. Smear uncooked side with
sauce before turning. Add lemon juice and oregano after turning.

NOTES:

*  Fish in a hot garlic/pecan sauce -- The Cajun Cafe in Portland
Oregon serves a sauce whose recipe they got under license from
K-Paul's in New Orleans.  They devoutly refused to answer all of my
questions about the sauce or its ingredients, so I've tried to
formulate it on my own, at home. This stuff doesn't taste exactly
like what the restaurant serves, but it's delicious in its own right.
Maybe it's best to title the recipe "fish with something not entirely
unlike hot fanny sauce."

This sauce is best served with a moderately strong fish: I would
recommend sturgeon, swordfish, or tuna.

*  If you are cooking more pieces of fish than will fit in the
skillet at once, make the sauce ahead, put it aside (keep warm) and
add it before cooking each piece of fish.

*  Serve with a simple rice or pasta dish.  I use saffron rice with
snow peas, or linguine with shrimp meat and pesto.

Fish In Mandarine & Parsley Sauce

fish

1  stephen ceideburg
2  to 4 mandarines
4  fish fillets
4  to 8 mandarines, juice only
1  piece fresh ginger, grated, 2 cm
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 large onions, chopped
2  to 3 cloves garlic, chopped
3 tablespoon olive oil

Use any good meaty fish fillets for this dish. Grate the mandarine
peel with a light hand on a sharp grater or it will tear.

Grate the zest of 2-4 mandarines (depending on size). Place 4 fish
fillets (about 800g) in a large dish and pour over them the juice of
4-8 mandarines mixed with 2 cm fresh ginger, grated. Cover and leave
in the refrigerator, turning occasionally, for up day or at least one
hour.

Finely chop 1 cupful or more of fresh parsley, 2 large onions and 2-3
large cloves of garlic. Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium
size saucepan, add the parsley, onion and garlic mixture, cover the
pan and sweat gently, stirring from time to time, until the onion is
almost melting.

Heat the grill to very hot, drain the mandarine fish mari- nade into
to onions and add the zest. Simmer the onions and marinade,
uncovered, until the excess liquid disappears. Puree in a food
processor, blend or sieve and add salt and pepper to taste. Reheat
gently. Meanwhile, dry the fish fillets, brush them with olive oil
and grill them for a couple of minutes on each turning only once,
until the fish flakes at its thickest point. Serve with the sauce.

cut it into small pieces.  Clean the fish and with a sharp knife
slash diagonally across the body of the fish. Mix lemongrass, curry
powder, salt and peppers.  Put the redfish in the mixture, coat well,
cover and refrigerate for one hour.  Heat oil in a large skillet, and
lightly saute the garlic. Then place the redfish in the skillet, let
brown very well before turning it over. (If the fish is not very
brown it will fall apart.) Brown well on other side, and serrve.

Fish Marinated In Herbed Olive Oil

fish, marinade

      ----WHOLE FAMILY COOKBOOK----
4  garlic cloves; peeled and
1  ; crushed
1  fresh rosmary; handful
1  ; removed from stems
1  fresh oregano; handful
1  ; removed from stems
1  italian parsely; handful
1  black pepper; fresh ground
1  fresh fish filets or steaks
1  ; (thick halibut or salmon
1  ; best)
2 cup olive oil
1  salt garnish
1  lemon wedges

Place the garlic, rosemary, oregano, parsley and black pepper in a
food processor and chop coarsely.  Rub both sides of desired fish and
place in a glass baking dish. (Do not add any salt or acids such as
lemon juice or vinegar at this time!)  Add the oil and turn the fish
a couple of times. The fish should be nearly or completely submerged
in the oil. For best results, the fish should be covered and
refrigated overnight. You may also marinate it for a few hours.

To cook, pat off the excess oil and lightly salt to taste. Grill,
broil, or bake to your liking.  Do not over cook! Serve with lemon
wedges. The leftover herbed oil can be refrigerated for a few day and
reused only for fresh seafood preparation.

TIME ESTIMATE: Hands on, 45 minutes COST ESTIMATE: Low

Without a doubt, this is England's most famous dish. Always deep
fried, the fish is mostly cod, and the batter made with eggs, milk
and flour.Liberally salted, the fish and chips are traditionally
doused with malt vinegar and wrapped in newspaper, so that everything
goes limp. My recipe is designed not to flaunt tradition, but to make
the taste available to those who count fat grams for good reason. My
method delivers this "grease heaven" for a mere 13 grams of fat per
serving...or 23 percents calories from fat. The peas are definitely
not "classic" -t hey simply don't behave well in a newspaper...but
then who does?

Helpful Hints BIG CHIPS. The bigger the better! We experimented for
some time with the idea that the larger the french fry the lower its
fat content would be. It's simply a matter of exposed surface area.
By cutting a large russet potato lengthwise into three slices both
ways, you'll get nine potato sticks between 1/2" and 3/4". When they
are cooked, you'll experience a completely new and fabulous taste -
potato, almost free of grease. DIRECTIONS: THE CHIPS: Preheat the
oven to 500F. In a large frying pan, heat the oil and fry the potato
sticks until brown on all sides - about 13 minutes. Transfer the
potatoes to a roaster pan and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven
and sprinkle with the salt. THE FISH: In a small bowl, combine the
cornmeal, bread crumbs, cayenne, salt, parsley and dill. Spread the
mixture out on a large plate. Pour the milk, flour and oil out, each
onto its own large plate. Set all 4 plates side by side.
Dip the fillets first into the milk and then into the flour, turning
until completely covered. Next dip the fish back into the milk, then
into the bread crumb mixture and through the oil. Place the breaded
cod on a baking sheet and bake for 8 minutes (you can time the fish
to cook for the last 8 minutes with the chips.) THE PEAS: In a medium
saucepan, bring the water to a boil and simmer the peas, salt, mint
and sugar until the peas are tender - about 3 minutes. TO SERVE:
Divide the fish and chips among 4 dinner plates. I serve this classic
with a "handy" wedge of lemon (easy to squeeze), peas and watercress.
It's the combination of golden browns and vivid greens and lemon
yellow that makes such a great picture.

Fish Pie

british, fish, main dish, vegetables

700 gm white fish
1  shallot
2 tablespoon dry white wine
2  eggs
450 ml milk
30 gm butter
30 gm flour
4 tablespoon chopped parsley
700 gm mashing potatoes
150 ml hot milk
60 gm butter
1  salt & pepper
50 gm shrimps/prawns or
1  other shellfish and/or
50 gm mushrooms

Wash the fish, which can be  a  mixture,  or  one single type, of cod,
hake, haddock, smoked haddock etc etc. and dry more or less. Chop the
shallot and put half of it into a buttered micro-wave dish. Put fish
on top, and sprinkle with remaining  shallot, a little salt and
pepper and the dry white wine. Cover loosely with cling film, pierced
in two or three places and microwave on full power for about 5 mins,
or until the fish is just cooked.

Meanwhile, peel, quarter and boil  the  potatoes, hard boil the eggs,
and make a white sauce with  the first lot of butter and milk, and
the flour. (I use a little bit of maggi cube to make it into a
bechamel ~ more or less. If using  mushrooms,  wipe  them, and cook
lightly in a little extra butter. If using shrimps or prawns, cook
them if needed, then shell them.

As soon as the fish is cool  enough  to  handle, flake it into a bowl,
taking care to remove any bones. Add the coarsely chopped hard boiled
eggs, and such of the optional ingredients as you are using.

Add the liquid exuded by the fish  during poaching to the white
sauce, and cook down gently until the original volume is reached
again. An alternative way of dealing with this liquid, is to cook it
down to a near syrup, then add  it to the white sauce - it has the
same effect, but needs a little more care. Taste carefully for
seasoning, and then add chopped parsley. Gently fold fish flavoured
parsley sauce into flaked fish and put the mixture into a pie dish of
suitable capacity.

When the potatoes are  done,  drain  them  and  mash. We use a potato
ricer, which works very well. Add the second quantity of butter and
the hot milk, stir briefly, season to taste and mix gently, taking
care not to develop the gluten. Spread the  mashed  potato over the
fish mixture, and if you like, make a bit of a pattern with a fork or
knife.

*May be cooked ahead to here

If not required immediately, allow to cool uncovered, then cover and
refrigerate until wanted.  Don't  keep for more then a day or so,
especially if using shrimps/prawns. When required, remove from fridge
and cook in pre-heated moderate oven  375øF 190øC until the mixture
is bubbling and the top is  browned 25-40 mins depending on whether
it was still warm when put into oven or had been refrigerated.

to 20 minutes, or until soft enough to cut. With a sharp knife, cut
into 2" cubes.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan.  Add prepared onions,
carrots and celery and saute, stirring, 3 to 5 minutes over medium
heat. Add garlic and saute another 1 or 2 minutes. Add tomatoes (and
their juices), stock and wine.  Tie bouquet garni spices in a
cheesecloth bag and attach with string to pot handle for easy

Fish Tacos Info

info, seafood

1 e *****

I hadn't thought about it -- fish tacos might not be familiar to many
people outside the So. Calif. area (not including people south of the
US/Mexico border, where fish tacos are more common). Basically,
"authentic" fish tacos are fish fillets that are batter dipped,
deep-fried, and wrapped up in a warmed, soft corn tortilla with
salsa, shredded cabbage, a mayonnaise based white sauce, and a wedge
of lime. The story of their "discovery" goes something like this:

During his college days, Ralph Rubio used to travel south of the
US/Mexico border for a little fun 'n suds during Spring Break. He
found fish tacos being served at taco stands in San Felipe, Baja
California. Deciding they might be as popular north of the border as
they were south, Rubio started experimenting with different batters
and a deep-fat fryer in 1982. He opened his first walk up Mexican
food outlet in San Diego in 1983. Rubio now owns a chain of Mexican
food resturants that stretches all over the county and probably
beyond. As evidence of the popularity of fish tacos, many San Diego
area resturants now serve at least one version; and, they've gone
beyond batter dipped deep-fried fish. They now include marinated
grilled fish, shell fish, shark...

1/4 lb white fish filets (such as rockfish; or turbot)
2 teaspoon minced green onions
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salad oil
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon liquid hot pepper seasoning
1 dash pepper
1 pkg tofu (about 22 oz)
1  salad oil
3  cloves garlic, minced
1/2  head iceberg lettuce, cut in 2 inch; squares
1/4 cup frozen peas, thawed
4 oz whole mushrooms
1 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon water

Finely chop fish.  Mix with green onion, soy sauce, cornstarch, salad
oil, sesame oil, salt, sugar, hot pepper seasoning and pepper, set
aside. Cut tofu block crosswise in four equal slices, then cut each
slice in half diagonally.  Place in a colander and let drain for 15
minutes, then place between paper towels and gently press out excess
water. Change paper towels several times until they no longer soak up
any moisture. On widest side of each triangle, cut a pocket to within
1/2 inch of edges. Gently stuff each pocket with about 1 1/2 t fish
filling.  In a wok or deep pan, pour oil to a depth of about 1 1/2
inches and heat to 350 degrees. Add several bean curd triangles at a
time and fry, turning once, until golden on all sides (about 4 to 5
minutes).  Remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Cool, cover,
and chill, if made ahead. In wide frying pan, heat 1 T salad oil over
medium-high heat.  Add garlic and cook, stirring, just until it
begins to brown.  Add lettuce, then stir and cook just until lettuce
begins to wilt (about one minute). Stir in peas and mushrooms; top
with stuffed tofu. Pour broth over tofu, cover, and simmer over low
heat for 8 minutes (15 minutes if chilled). Stir together cornstarch,
soy and water. Push tofu away from one side of pan and stir soy
mixture into broth; cook, stirring carefully so as not to break the
tofu, until sauce bubbles and thickens.

Fishy Fries

fish, main dish

213 gm canned pink alaska salmon
100 gm plain flour
1  salt and pepper; to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
150 ml skimmed milk or water
2  egg whites
1  sunflower oil (for deep fat frying)
      ----TO SERVE----
1  spicy tomato sauce; and/or
1  tartar sauce to serve

Drain the can of salmon and flake. Set aside.

Put the flour into a bowl along with the seasoning and vegetable oil.
Gradually beat in the milk or water until smooth and thick.

Whisk the egg whites until they are stiff and fold these into the
batter along with the salmon flakes. Heat the oil for frying in a
deep fat fryer, over a moderate heat. Carefully drop tablespoons of
the salmon batter into the hot oil. (It is better to cook the salmon
fries 4-5 at a time depending on the size of your fryer. Keep the
prepared ones warm in a low oven whilst cooking the rest.)

Turn each salmon fry over after about 45 seconds to brown the other
side. Use plenty of oil for frying as the batter will need to rise
and move about the pan to cook properly. When golden brown all over,
remove from the oil with a slated spoon and drain on absorbent
kitchen paper. Serve the fries hot with tomato sauce or tartar.

Serves 6-8. Approx. 220 kcals per serving

Fiskepudding Eller Fiskefarse (Fish Pudding O

appetizers, main dish, norwegian, seafood

1 tablespoon butter; soft
2 tablespoon bread crumbs; dry
1 1/2 lb cod or haddock; skinned and boned
1/2 cup light cream and
1 cup heavy cream; combined
2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch

"To make an authentic Norwegian fish pudding - white, delicate and
sponging in consistency - you should begin with absolutely fresh
white fish. The pudding is served weekly in Norwegian homes, usually
hot, with melted butter or a shrimp sauce (see recipe). Cold and
sliced, it is also excellent as part of an open-faced sandwich." With
a pastry brush or paper towel, spread the bottom and side of a 1 1/2
quart loaf pan or mold with 1 tablespoon of soft butter and sprinkle
the mold with 2 tablespoons of dry bread crumbs. Make sure the crumbs
are evenly distributed and tap out any excess. Cut the fish into
small pieces and place a few pieces at a time in a blender, along
with a couple of tablespoons of the combined creams to facilitate
pureing. Blend at high speed, turning the machine off after the
first few seconds to scrape down the sides of the jar with a spatula.
Continue to blend, one batch at a time, until all of the fish is a
smooth pure. As you proceed, use as much of the cream as you need to
form this smooth pure. Place the pured fish in a large mixing bowl,
beat in 2 teaspoons of salt and the 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch and
slowly add any of the cream that was not used in the blender, beating
vigorously until the mixture is very light and fluffy. Pour into the
prepared mold and bang sharply on the counter to settle the pudding
and eliminate any air pockets. Smooth the top with a spatula. Preheat
oven to 350øF. Butter a sheet of tin foil and seal it tightly around
the top of the mold. Place the mold in a baking pan and pour into the
pan enough boiling water to come 3/4 of the way up the sides of the
mold. Set the pan in the middle of the oven for 1 to 1 1/4 hours,
regulating the heat if necessary so that the water simmers but does
not boil; if it boils, the pudding will have holes. When the top of
the pudding is firm to the touch and a toothpick or skewer in the
middle comes out dry and clean, the pudding is done. Remove the mold
from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Pour off all excess liquid
in mold, run a sharp knife around the inside, place a heated platter
on top and holding the mold and plate together, quickly invert the
two to remove the pudding from the mold. Clear the place of any
liquid with paper towels and serve the fiskepudding while still hot.
TO MAKE FISH BALLS: Prepare the fish in the blender as described
above. Chill the pured fish in the mixing bowl for about 30 minutes,
then roll about 1 tablespoon of the fish in your hands at a time, to
make 1" balls. Refrigerate them, covered with wax paper, until ready

Food For A Hobo Hike

fish, main dish, seafood

4 can tuna (3 oz each)
4 can baked beans (6 oz each)
4  oranges
4  plastic
4  bandana clots
4  children

Place 1 can tuna, 1 can beans, 1 orange, and 1 fork on each banadana.
Bring up corners and tie securely.  Tie end to children's belt loop
or attach to a stick and send them off on their hobo hike. Pack
another hobo pouch for yourself and go along.  Make sure someone has
a Scout knife with a can opener attachment to open cans (much more
fun struggling with one of these things than to take a conventional
can opener).  The oranges serve as both a drink and a dessert.  Poke
a hole in one end and after all the juice has been sucked out, open
it and eat the flesh. The tuna and beans, of course, are eaten just
as they come from the can. The bandanas serve as little tablecloths,
napkins, and kerchiefs to be worn back home. Children love this hobo
picnic--it's easy for you, nutritious, filling, and fun from them.

Forcemeat Stuffed Speckled

fish, wild game, wildgame

1  forcemeat, 3-4 lb, speckled
1  egg white
1/2 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup fish, raw
1  salt
1  paprika

Put fish through meat grinder then pound to a paste in mortar or in
chopping bowl. Work in gradually the unbeaten egg white and add the
seasonings. Press the fish through a sieve and add the cream. This
stuffing is quite rich, but if a plainer one is preferred the same
proportions of raw fish and seasonings are to be used, the fish being
treated as above; then, when pounded to a paste add one-third cup of
soft bread crumbs cooked in five tablespoonfuls of milk. Mix all
thoroughly and bind with one unbeaten egg. Stuff fish and bake in 375
degree oven for 25 minutes or until flaky. Serve with good sauce.

Gesmoorde Vis (Salt Cod & Potatoes With Tomato Sauce)

african, seafood

1 lb salt cod
3 medium boiling potatoes (about 1 pound)
4 medium firm ripe tomatoes
3 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 small onions, peeled and cut crosswise in; to slices 1/8 inch thick
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon finely chopped fres; h hot chilies
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1 tablespoon light-brown sugar
1  lemon, cut lengthwise into 4 or 6 w; edges
1  parsley sprigs

Starting a day ahead, place the cod in a glass, enameled or
stainless-steel pan or bowl.  Cover it with cold water and soak for
at least 12 hours, gently squeezing the cod dry and changing the
water every 3 or 4 hours.

Drain the cod, rinse it thoroughly under cold running water, and cut
it into 1-inch pieces.

Drop the potatoes into enough lightly salted boiling water to cover
them completely and cook briskly, uncovered, until they are almost
tender and show only slight resistance when pierced with the point of
a sharp knife. Drain and peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch
cubes.

Place the tomatoes in a pan of boiling water and let them boil
briskly for about 10 seconds.  Run cold water over them, and peel
them with a small, sharp knife.  Cut the tomatoes crosswise into
1/8-inch- thick rounds.

In a heavy 10 to 12-inch skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat
until a light haze forms above it.  Drop in the onions and, stirring
frequently, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are soft and
golden brown. Watch carefully for any sign of burning and regulate
the heat accordingly. Add the tomatoes, 1 tablespoon of the chilies,
the garlic and sugar, and cook briskly, uncovered, stirring from time
to time, until most of the liquid in the pan has evaporated and the
mixture is thick enough to hold its shape lightly in a spoon.

Stir in the cod and potatoes, reduce the heat to low, and cover
tightly. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily
when prodded gently with a fork.  Taste for seasoning.

Serve the gesmoorde vis at once, mounded on a heated platter or in a
large bowl.  Sprinkle with the remaining teaspoon of chopped chilies
and arrange the lemon wedges and parsley sprigs decoratively on top.
Serve accompanied, if you like, by hot boiled rice and lemon or green
bean atjar.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.

Ghana Shrimp: Shrimp With Ghana Sauce

sauces

12 medium cooked shrimp -- shelled
1 teaspoon red pepper -- paste, as
1  follows
1  ~ghana red pepper paste
1/4 cup dry red wine
1 teaspoon ground red pepper (cayenne)
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/8 teaspoon ground coriander
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic -- powder
1/4 cup paprika

If using frozen, thaw, wash, and dry the shrimp. Remove shells. Place
the measure of Ghana Sauce in a glass bowl; add shrimp and toss to
coat well. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Heat the
WOK; spray with a little oil; add the shrimp and cook till hot; no
more than 5 minutes. Serve at once with a black bean salad, like
Texas Caviar (or Crowder Bean salsa). Steamed rice is nice.

Place all ingredients except the paprika in a small glass bowl. Stir
well. Heat paprika in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat 1 minute,
stirring constantly.  Gradually stir in the spice mixture until the
paste is smooth. Heat about 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until
hot. Cool for a dipping sauce.  Cool for a marinade. Freeze for
future use.

Alternative: Heat paprika, cumin and ground coriander in a dry pan
over low to medium-low heat to "toast" and renew the dried spices.
Remove from the heat and transfer to a 1-cup pyrex measure for
further blending. Add the other spices to the pan. Stirring
constantly, add the wine and make a paste. I have stored the paste in
a space jar for 2 months. Might last longer in a zip-lock bag that
can be "burped" or if we didn't use it up in other recipes calling
for a sweet-hot sauce.

Giffilte Fish

appetizers, ethnic, seafood

5 lb fish; equal amounts pike, carp,
3  onions; sliced
1  celery stalk; sliced
3  large carrots; sliced water; to cover sa
1  white pepper; to taste
4  eggs
2 tablespoon matzo meal
1  salt to taste
1  white pepper to taste
1/4 cup water
1  carrots; sliced for pan
1  onions; sliced for pan
1 bunch beets; sliced (optional)

Have fish man grind: 5 lbs.fish filets-equal amounts; white fish and
pike;and a small amount of carp or buffle carp; In a large kettle:
heads,bones,and trimmings of fish; 3 onions,sliced; 1 celery
stalk,sliced; 2 large carrots,sliced; water to cover; salt to taste;
white pepper to taste;  Bring to boil. While this is simmering
prepare the fish.
Combine in Food Processor: 1 onion; 4 eggs; add mixture to: ground
fish; 2 tbs.matzo meal ; salt to taste; white pepper to taste; 1/4
cup water; Shape fish mixture into balls. I used to do this by hand;
chopping in a large wooden bowl with a hack messer. Be CARFUL, you
don't want mush but distinct tiny peices.
Take another pan; and layer the beets on the bottom; some sliced
carrots, onions, fish; repeat with everything but the beets. end eith
some carrots. Pour the broth from the OTHER kettle over the fish.
Simmer,covered for 2 hours.  When cool,remove fish balls to platter
and garnish with sliced cooked carrots. Strain broth and chill.
Serve with jellied fish broth and fresh ground horseradish. NOTE: The
beets are unusal but my Mom and Bubbe ALWAYS used them. They do two
things; keep the fish from 'catching' on the bottom and give the
broth a ruby red color; but not the fish; they remain white.

I have never served it with anything but plain freshly grated
horseradish.

Ginger Salmon Steaks

fish, main dish, vegetables

1  piece fresh ginger root; peeled, (about 2 x 1/2 x
1 large green onion
1/2 bunch arugula or watercress
1  olive or salad oil
2 small salmon steaks; each about 3/4-inch thick
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 pint cherry tomatoes
6 slice white bread

ABOUT 30 MINUTES BEFORE SERVING:

Slice the ginger root and green onion into 2-inch long,
matchstick-thin, strips.  Arrange the arugula on a platter. In a
10-inch skillet over medium-high heat in 1-inch of hot oil, cook the
ginger root and green onion until lightly browned.  With a slotted
spoon, remove the ginger root mixture to a small bowl and set aside.
In the remaining oil in the skillet, cook the salmon steaks, turning
once, until browned and the fish flakes easily when tested with a
fork, about 10 minutes. Place the salmon steaks on top of the
arugula. Discard any remaining oil in the skillet, then stir in the
sherry, sow sauce, and 2 Tb of water, blending well and heating
through.  Pour the sherry mixture over the salmon steaks and sprinkle
the ginger root mixture on top of the steaks. While the salmon steaks
are cooking, in a 3-quart saucepan, heat 2 ts of salad oil and cook
the cherry tomatoes until just heated through. Cut 1 heart shape out
of each slice of bread and toast the hearts.  (Save the trimmings for
bread crumbs to be used another day.)  Serve the Salmon Steaks with
the toasted hearts and cooked cherry tomatoes.

Goong Kob Poh (Hot & Cold Shrimp)

seafood, thai

1 kg medium size fresh shrimp
7  red hot chili
3  cloves garlic
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup hot water
2 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon hot sauce *
1 tablespoon chopped coriander
1  * (sriracha or sambel lampung) [sri; racha is a

Thai hot sauce, available here, and comes in several varieties++ from
mildly warm to blisteringly hot. Some of them are quite similar to a
thick Tabasco sauce which is what I would use for a substitute. S.C.]

Here is a recipe from my new Thai cookbook that is mainly a dip,
since the shrimp are either grilled or eaten raw with the rest of the
ingredients. I haven't made this yet, but the dip sounds quite
similar to the Vietnamese "Nuoc Cham" (which would be good also.)

Peel shrimp, remove the center black line, leave the tail on. Clean
and drain, arrange on a plate, chill for 2 hours. Pound the chili and
garlic until fine. Place into a small bowl. Mix sugar, salt and hot
water and stir until sugar is dissolved.  Pour over pounded chili and
garlic. Add lime juice and hot sauce, stir and top with chopped
coriander.

To Serve:  Thread the shrimp onto the sticks.  Cook over charcoal
until done to satisfaction.  Dip in prepared sauce to taste. It can
be served raw and cold.

Goong Ope Maw Din (Clay Pot Shrimp With Bean

seafood, thai

8 oz bean thread noodles
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 cup cilantro pesto (see recipe)
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely chopped
1 lb shrimp, peeled & deveined
1/3 cup coarsely chopped green onion
1/4 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoon fish sauce (nam pla)
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon chinese rice wine or:
1  dry sherry
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon asian sesame oil
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  handful of cilantro leaves
      ----CILANTRO PESTO----
1 teaspoon whole white or black
1  peppercorns
2 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh
1  cilantro roots or leaves
1  and stems
2 tablespoon coarsely chopped garlic

CILANTRO PESTO:  Using a mortor and pestle or a spice grinder, crush
or grind the peppercorns to a fine powder. Combine the pepper,
cilantro roots and garlic; work the three inngredients innto a fairly
smooth paste in the mortor or in a small blender or food processor.
If you use a blender or food processor, you may need to add a little
vegetable oil or water to ease the grinding.  Make about 1/4 cup. For
an industrial strength batch use 1 tb peppercorns, 1/2 cup cilantro
roots and 1/2 cup garlic. To store the pesto for later use, put in a
glass jar, pour a little oil onto the surface to cover it and seal
tightly. It will keep nicely for about 1 week in the refrigerator.

CLAY POT SHRIMP:  Place the noodles in a large bowl and add warm
water to cover.  Soak the noodles until they become limp and white,
about 15 minutes.  Drain and set aside. You should have about 5 cups
softened noodles.  In a large clay pot or flameproof, heavy-bottomed
casserole, heat the oil over medium heat until hot, about 1 minute.
Add the pesto and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute, adding a
little more oil if it sticks or burns.  Add the ginger and shrimp and
stir-fry for 1 minute. Toss in the green onion, turning the mixture
once more. Transfer the shrimp to a plate and set aside while you
prepare the noodles and sauce. In a small bowl, combine the chicken
stock, fish sauce (Nam Pla), oyster sauce, rice wine, soy sauce,
sesame oil, sugar and salt; stir to mix well. Place the soaked
noodles in the clay pot in which you cooked the shrimp mixture.
Scrape the shrimp mixture over the noodles and pour in the chicken
stock mixture.  Toss the noodles and shrimp a little to combine them
with the sauce, then cover the pot tightly. Place the clay pot over
medium heat and cook until the noodles are soft and clear and the
shrimp is done, about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with the cilantro leaves
and serve at once. From: Real Thai, The Best Of Thailand's Regional

Gratin Of Walleye

seafood

2 lb walleye fillets
2 tablespoon parsley, minced
1  salt and pepper
2 tablespoon capers (w/juice)
2  green peppers
5 tablespoon cooking oil
1/2 cup bread crumbs
2  cloves garlic, chopped fine
1/2 teaspoon powdered thyme

Roasted peppers lend a wonderful flavor to fish dishes. Prepare this
dish in a shallow baking dish or baked in individual gratin dishes if
available. Wash and pat the fillets dry, then dice into 1-inch
squares. Season with salt and pepper.
Wash, then dry the green peppers and roast them under the broiler,
turning them as the skin blackens. Place the peppers in a paper bag,
seal by twisting the top, and set aside for 5 minutes or so. Then
remove and, with finger, push and pinch off most of the blackened
skin. Cut in half, remove the seeds and stems and slice into thin
strips.
Put the oil in a big skillet and saute the garlic until it is
translucent.  Then scrape in the fillet squares from your cutting
board, turn up the heat, and cook, stirring constantly for about 5
minutes.
Off heat, add and mix thoroughly the peppers, parsley, capers, and
half the bread crumbs into which you have mixed the thyme. Spoon into
baking dish and sprinkle the rest of the crumb-thyme mixture over
all, and place under the broiler for a minute or two to brown. Serve
with tossed salad and baked potatoes.

Gravlax (Salmon Marinated In Dill)

appetizers, main dish, seafood, swedish

3 lb fresh salmon fillet; center cut, cleaned & sca
1 large bunch dill; fresh, whole
1/4 cup kosher salt (coarse, or regular is; necessary)
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoon white peppercorns (or black) crushe; d

Cut the salmon in half lengthwise and remove the backbone and the
small, freebones, as well, or ask your fish delaer to do it for you.
Leave the skin on. Place half of the fish, skin side down, in a deep
glass, enamel or stainless steel baking dish or casserle. Wash and
then shake dry the bunch of dill and place it on the fish. (If the
fill is of the hothouse variety and not very pungent, chop the herb
coarsely to release it's flavor and sprinkle it over the fish
instead.) In a separate bowl, combine the salt, sugar and crushed
peppercorns. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the dill. Top with the
other half of the fish, skin side up. Cover with foil and set a heavy
plate or platter on top of it, slightly larger than the salmon. Weigh
it down with cans or jars and refrigerate for at least 3 days, up to
7 days. Turn the fish over every 12 hours or so, basting with the
liquid marinade that accumulates, separating the halves a little to
baste the salmon inside. Replace the platter and weights each time.
When the gravlax is finished, remove the fish from it's marinade and
scrape away the dill and seasonings. Pat dry with paper towels. Or
leave the dill and seasonings in place. Place the separated halves
skin side down on a carving board and slice the salmon thinly on the
diagonal, detaching each slice from the skin. Gravlax is served as
part of a smorgasbord or as an appetizer and is usually accompanied
by a mustard-dill sauce (see recipe). When gravlax is presented as a
main course, it is garnished with lemon wedges as well as the
mustard-dill sauce and served with toast and perhaps a cucumber salad.

.\\ichele's Notes: This is one of the easiest recipes to make. Long
as you start it in advance it's basically a no-brainer. Just remember
to turn and baste every 12 hours. And slice thin. Mmmmmmm, its great!

Great Shrimp Scampi'

italian

1  shrimp; large
1  parsley
1  salt
1  garlic
1  olive oil

Peel large shrimp and marinate, for 1 hour, in olive oil, garlic,
salt, and parsley.  Try a pinch or two of chili powder. Quickly
pan-fry. I use an Electric Wok at 350 degrees, I use lots of garlic,
and I use Garlic salt in- stead of regular salt. I add cooked
linguine or pasta (al dente), toss well to  coat the pasta and
sprinkle with a little more parsley and serve. It's fast and very
easy and really delicious. Please let me know if you try it and if
you like it or not!!! Bunny Cherish Kaplan (gkfm11a)

Green Shrimp Soup

seafood, soups

1 medium onion
1 large carrot (about 5 oz)
1 1/2 teaspoon butter
3 cup meat broth, hot
1 tablespoon savory (fresh, chopped fine)
1 teaspoon tarragon (fresh, chopped fine)
1 lb peas (cooked in lightly salted wate; r)
5 oz shrimp (deveined, cooked and cut in; to small pieces)
1/2 cup white wine, dry
2 tablespoon cream
1 cup champagne (demi sec)

Chop the onion and carrot finely.  Heat the butter in a pan and fry
the vegetables for 5 minutes stirring continuously. Add the hot meat
broth. Boil for 10 minutes.

Add savory, tarragon and peas.  Bring to a boil and let cook for 8
minutes. Strain the soup and put it back into the pan.

Add shrimp.  Simmer 5 minutes on medium heat.  (Be sure the soup is
not boiling.)  Add white wine and cream. Take from the heat. Season if
necessary.  Add champagne and serve immediately.

NOTES:

*  Fine pea soup with shrimp and champagne -- This is a recipe out of
a German low-calorie cookbook. It is a simple recipe for a really
delicate soup. It can be served as a festive appetizer or as a
gourmet snack.

*  The fresh spices can be substituted by dried spices.

*  If you use canned shrimp, never let them boil. They would become
tough and lose their delicate taste.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  40 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Griddled Trout With Herbs

fish, seafood

6  fresh cleaned trout
6  sprigs fresh rosemary, or 1 1/2 tab; lespoons dried
3 oz soft butter
18  fresh mint leaves or 2 teaspoons dr; ied
6  sprigs fresh thyme (leaves only) or; 2 teaspoons dried
6  fresh sage leaves or 1 scant teaspo; on dried
1 1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt
7  grinds black pepper

The herbs are what might have been used in Anglo-Saxon East Anglia,
but use whatever you might fancy. Try to use fresh, although dried is
acceptable. Put one sprig or generous shake of rosemary down the
middle of each fish. Chop all the other herbs and seasonings and mash
them into the soft butter. Use this to coat the fish generously on
each side. Griddle, barbeque or grill it for 4-5 minutes on each side
or till the skin is well browned and the flesh flaking off the bone.
Baste now and then with the butter which runs off. Serve at once with
lot of fresh bread and a salad or a simple green vegetable.

Grilled Beet & Smoked Trout Salad With Chiv

appetizers, fish, salads

2 large red beets
3 cup rice vinegar
4 cup water
2 tablespoon mustard seeds
1 tablespoon anise seed
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cumin seed
4 oz grape seed oil
1  bunch fresh chives
1  salt to taste
1 oz lemon juice
12 oz whole smoked rainbow trout
      ----FOR GARNISH----
4 small bunches of baby leaf lettuce
1  zest of 1 lemon

Peel the beets and slice into 1/4 inch thick rounds. In a nonreactive
pot combine the venegar, seeds, and sugar. Bring to a boil and reduce
by half. Add the water and bring back to a boil. Add beets and cook
until done but still firm. Remove from heat and let beets cool in
liquid. (The beets can be done a week ahead.)

To make the lemon vinegar: Combine 2 ounces of the strained cooking
liquid from the beets with the lemon juice. If necessary, remove the
bones from the trout. Bones can be easily removed by taking out the
backbone, and the pin bones for the most part will come with it. Peel
skin off the fillets. Flake the fish gently into small pieces about
the size of lump crab meat. Store the fish in the refrigerator or
until ready to serve.

To make the chive oil: Combine the chives with the grape seed oil in a
blender. Puree until smooth; season with salt.

To assemble the salad: Remove the beets from the liquid and cook on a
grill or in a skillet until warmed. Place three slices of beet onto
each plate. Drizzle about 1 T chive oil around beets; do the same
with the lemon vinegar. Divide the trout into equal portions and
place a small pile of trout on top of the beets. Finish salads by
placing one small bunch of baby lettuce in the center of each plate
and sprinkling with lemon zest.

appetizers, seafood

      ----MARINADE----
1 teaspoon fresh parsley; chopped
1 tablespoon garlic; finely chopped
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 small jalapeno chile; seed/mince
1 lb squid; cleaned/in 1 rounds
      ----SAUCE----
1 tablespoon garlic; finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary; fine chop
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup clam juice
1 tablespoon lobster base; *
2 tablespoon whipped butter

* Lobster base is a glaze sold in gourmet food shops and some
supermarkets

1. Prepare marinade: Thoroughly whisk together all marinade
ingredients in a glass or stainless-steel bowl. Add squid pieces and
marinate at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally.

2. To make sauce: About 15 minutes before serving time, combine
garlic, rosemary, wine, clam juice and lobster base in a non-aluminum
saucepan. Bring to a gently simmer over medium heat, then simmer for
4 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the butter. Keep warm.

3. Remove squid from marinade, draining well. Grill for 4 to 6
minutes, turning as needed, until just firm. (An open grill or a
well-heated, ridged grill pan may be used. You may need to use a
grill basket to hold the squid pieces if the spaces on your grill are
too wide to hold them.)

4. Shake saucepan to recombine sauce if necessary, then add cooked
squid. Raise heat to high and cook for 1 minute, stirring to coat all
pieces well.

5. Serve with an extra dab of sauce.

Grilled Fish (Rubey)

none

1 lb swordfish -- fresh
1  spray oil

Swordfish comes with skin.  Try Ono, a Hawaiian fish (comes
skinless). With fish at room temperature, lightly spray or brush with
oil. (Do this away from grill to prevent any possibility of flameup.)
On hot grill, cook fish for 5 minutes. Carefully turn over and
continue cooking, allowing about 10 minutes altogether per inch
thickness of fish. Check for doneness in thickest part of fish,
carefully pulling apart and looking to see if flesh is opaque.
Remember, fish will continue to cook a bit even after it is removed
from heat. Remove any skin, if desired. Serve on top of Grilled
Smashed Red Potatoes; top with Papaya, Pepper Relish.

NOTES : If you use your own fresh fish in this recipe, aim for about
2 oz. of cooked, boned and skinned fish per person -- if you want to
keep the protein values in line. If you are purchasing fish, fattier
fishes such as swordfish and salmon lend themselves to grilling
better than lean fishes such as halibut and tuna. In either case,
take care not to overcook; fish will become dry, even tough, when
overdone, especially if lean. Recipe By : Jane Rubey, 1996,

Grilled Fish In Banana Leaf

fish, oriental, seafood

3  garlic cloves
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
2 tablespoon chopped fresh coriander root
1 slice fresh ginger, quarter-sized   crush; ed -
1 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce
2 lb whole snapper =or=- striped bass -=; or=-
4  whole trout
1 large banana leaf (or more if needed)
1  vegetable oil (for oiling leaf)
      ----CHILE LIME SAUCE----
3 small green serrano chiles  seeded and fi; nely chopped
3  garlic cloves
2 tablespoon fresh coriander leaves
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
1/3 cup chicken stock

This recipe illustrates the popular use of banana leaves as a food
wrapper in Asia. Aluminum foil works well as a substitute.

IN A MINI-FOOD PROCESSOR, add the garlic, peppercorns, coriander root
and ginger; process into a fine mince. Transfer into a mortar and
pound into a smooth paste; add soy sauce and blend thoroughly. Clean
fish and pat dry with paper towel. Rub garlic mixture over entire
fish; set aside for 30 minutes. Choose a banana leaf about 6 inches
longer and 3 times wider than the fish. Rinse leaf with cold water to
clean. Plunge leaf into a pot of boiling water for a few seconds to
soften. Wipe dry. Using a knife or scissors, remove the thick spine
in the leaf. Place the leaf with its glossy side down on a work
surface. (Use more leaves if needed.) Brush oil on the leaf where the
fish will lie. Set the fish with the marinade on the oiled surface.
Fold over the wide sides overlapping at the top and secure with
toothpicks. Turn over package, fold over ends to enclose sides, and
secure ends with toothpicks to make a neat parcel. Set packet about 3
inches above medium-high heat coals and grill each side for 8 to 10
minutes. NOTE: If using trout, marinate the 4 fish together. Wrap
each 1 individually and reduce the grilling time to about 3 minutes
on each side. Serves 4 as part of an Asian multicourse menu. Transfer
to a serving plate. Open leaf and serve with accompanying sauce.

CHILE LIME SAUCE: In a mortar or a mini-food processor, add the
chiles, garlic, coriander leaves, sugar and salt; pound (or chop)
into a smooth paste. Put chile mixture into a saucepan with lime
juice and stock; bring ~--

Grilled Fish Tacos

seafood

1 x no ingredients

Recipe by: Rich McCormack <macknet@CTS.COM> Marinate shark or fish
fillets (tuna, swordfish, halibut, mahi-mahi, or whatever) in lime
juice and salsa picante (as "picante" as you wish) for about 30
minutes. Grill the fillets on a charcoal, electric, or gas BBQ grill
(or a ribbed cast iron "grilling" pan on a stove top), sprinkling
both sides with Rich's pico de gallo spice mix (see above) during the
grilling. The grill can be brushed with olive, corn, or peanut oil to
keep the fish from sticking. When done, slice the fish into approx.
1/2 inch slices and serve as above.

To be honest, when I suggest fish tacos to visiting friends or
relatives from out of the So. Calif. area, I usually get some sort of
a response such as "you ain't gonna put no fish on MY taco." But
those who try 'em usually like 'em...

BTW -- Have you ever tried fish enchiladas? Mmmmm...mmm, muy bueno

Grilled Fish Tacos With Green Salsa

main dish, seafood

3 1/2 cup finely shredded red or green -cabba; ge
1/4 cup white distilled vinegar
1  salt and pepper
3/4 lb fresh tomatillos *
2 tablespoon salad oil
1  onion, cut into 1/2 slices
1 1/2 lb firm-fleshed skinned fish fillets (; lingcod, sea bass)
4  jalapeno chilies
2 teaspoon lime juice
3/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves
1  clove garlic
12  warm corn or low-fat flour -tortill; as (6-7 inch)
1  low-fat sour cream
1  lime wedges

* Look for the small green tomatillos with papery husks in some
supermarkets and Latino grocery stores. If unavailable, substitute
small Roma tomatoes and add more lime juice to taste.

Mix cabbage with vinegar and 3 tablespoons water.  Add salt and
pepper to taste.  Cover and chill.

Remove and discard husks from tomatillos; rinse tomatillos. Thread
onto skewers.  Brush some of the oil lightly onto onion slices. Rinse
fish and pat dry. Brush fish with remaining oil.

Place tomatillos, onion, and chilies on a barbecue grill (high heat).
Cook, turning as needed, until vegetables are browned, 8-10 mintues.
Set aside to cool.

Place fish on grill (med-high heat).  Cook, turning once, until fish
is opaque but still moist-looking in thickest part (cut to test),
10-14 minutes.

Remove stems from chilies; remove seeds (if you want less heat). In a
blender or food processor, whirl tomatillos, chilies, lime juice, 1/4
c cilantro, and garlic until smooth. Chop onion. Add the chopped
onion to salsa mixture, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour into small
bowl.

To assemble each taco, fill a tortilla with a little cabbage relish,
a few chunks of fish, salsa, and sour cream. Add a squeeze of lime,
and salt and pepper to taste.

Grilled Jumbo Shrimp With Citrus Sauce

seafood

      ----MARINADE----
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1  grated zest of 1 orange
1  grated zest of 1 lime
1 tablespoon fresh basil; minced or
1/2 tablespoon dried basil
1 teaspoon fresh thyme; minced or
1/2 teaspoon dried
1 lb extra-large shrimp; about 18 shells removed;
      ----VEGETABLE SAUTE----
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 cup vegetable; (use artichokes, fennel,
1  clove garlic; minced
1  salt and ground black pepper
3 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
      ----CITRUS SAUCE----
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon grapefruit juice
1 tablespoon lime juice
2 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon dijon-style mustard

For the marinade, combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add
the shrimp and marinate for about 3 hours. (Note the recipe states to
marinate at room temperature, but I would not leave it out for that
amount of time. The safest thing to do is to marinate in the
refrigerator.)

When the marinating time is over, make the vegetable saute. In a
saute pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the vegetables and
garlic; saute for 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Season with salt
and pepper. Add the balsamic vinegar and continue cooking for 1
minute more.

To make the citrus vinaigrette, combine all the ingredients in a
mixing bowl.  Whisk to dissolve the honey.

Remove the shrimp from the marinade and grill or broil for 2 minutes
on each side.

Divide the sauteed vegetables among 6 salad plates, put 3 shrimp on
top of each, and pour on the citrus vinaigrette.

Grilled Rudderfish With Maltese Sauce

fish

1  stephen ceideburg
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large chopped onion
4  cloves garlic, chopped
400 gm peeled tomatoes with juice
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1  salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoon capers
1 small lemon, zest only
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint
4  serving size pieces rudderfish

Good capers are essential to this dish. If possible, visit a deli
whose owners are of Mediterranean extraction and buy bulk capers
which have been packed in salt. Rinse them to remove the salt before
using. If you have to use the more readily available capers bottled
in a vinegar solution, blot them dry of vinegar before using.

In a tablespoon of olive oil. gently fry a large onion, chopped. until
transparent. Add 4 cloves of garlic, crushed or finely chopped, and
cook for a minute or so longer, then add a 400 g tin of peeled
tomatoes. chopped, together with their juice, 1 tablespoon lemon
juice and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for about 20 minutes, then
add 2 heaped tablespoons of capers, the zest of a small lemon and a
tablespoon of finely chopped fresh mint. Simmer again until the sauce
is thick. Meanwhile heat the grill to very hot, dip 4 serving-size
pieces of rudderfish in olive oil and put them under the grill for
3-5 minutes, turning once if using a conventional grill. You may not
need to turn the fish at all if you have a fan assisted grill.

Spoon the sauce onto warmed plates, add the fish and serve,
preferably with good bread to ensure no sauce is wasted.

Grilled Rum-Soaked Shrimp With Mango Lime Rel

alcohol, main dish, seafood

      ----MANGOLIME RELISH----
3  mangoes
1 small bell peppers
1 small bell peppers, red
1 small onions, red
1 cup juice, pineapple
4 tablespoon juice, lime
1 teaspoon garlic cloves, crushed
4 tablespoon vinegar, red wine
1 tablespoon curry powder
      ----FISH----
32 large shrimp
8 tablespoon juice, lime
1 1/2 cup juice, pineapple
1/2 cup rum, dark
1 teaspoon garlic cloves, crushed

Seed bell peppers.

Peel mangoes and slice fruit away from central pit. Dice the mango
fruit, red pepper, green pepper and onion. Combine all the remaining
ingredients in a bowl. Mix lightly then add diced mango, pepper and
onion. Mixture will keep in the refrigerator for three days.

Peel the shrimp and make a 1/4-inch deep incision on the top of each
one (the side without the feet) from tail to the head. Under cold,
running water, open the incision and wash away any brownish-black
waste matter.

In a large stainless steel bowl, combine the lime juice, pineapple
juice, rum, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Add he shrimp.
Cover and refrigerate for 2-4 hours - no longer, or the shrimp will
start to cook in the lime juice.

Remove the shrimp from the marinade and discard the liquid. Run a
skewer through each shrimp so that each is pierced in two places. Put
the skewer through the tail area, then bend the shrimp over and put
the skewer through the thick section in the upper body area.

You should be able to fit 4 shrimp on a 6-inch skewer or 8 shrimp on
a 10 inch skewer.

If you are using wooden skewers, be careful not to leave any gaps
between the shrimp, or the skewer will burn through. Place the
skewered shrimp on a grill over medium-high heat.

Grill for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until the shells turn
bright red.

The meat should be an even opaque white. Remove the shrimp from the
grill ad serve on a bed of Mango-Lime relish.

The recipes are from _Thrill of the Grill_

Grilled Salmon With Lemon & Thyme

fish

4 lb salmon fillet; skinned
3 tablespoon cognac
1/4 cup lemon peel; minced
2 tablespoon shallot; minced
1 1/2 tablespoon kosher salt
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar, brown
1 tablespoon thyme, fresh; minced
3/4 teaspoon pepper

Place salmon fillets on heavy large baking sheet.  Rub Cognac over
both sides of fish.  Mix together all remaining ingredients in small
bowl. Rub over both sides of fish. Cover with plastic wrap. Top with
another baking sheet.  Weight with heavy object. Refrigerate at least
6 hours or overnight.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill fish until cooked through,
about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to plates and serve.

Note: Bon Appetit recommends a sturdy red wine, such as a Beaujolais
from Moulin-a-Vent.  They also recommend serving with sauteed zuc-
chini. You could also diagonally slice thickly some zucchini with
peel left on and brush with butter, lemon and thyme mixture and grill
next to the fish; a Griffo grill would help but if you sliced the
zucchini thick enough and on a strong enough diagonal, I don't think
you would have problems with it falling through the grill. Some fresh
steamed green beans with butter and freshly ground pepper would also
be good.

Grilled Salmon With Potato & Watercress Salad

fish, grill, low fat, salads

3 lb small red thin-skinned
1  potatoes
1 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1  about 1/2 pound watercress
1  rinsed and crisped
1  salmon fillet, about 2 lbs.
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon firmly packed brown sugar
2 cup alder or mesquite wood chips
1  soaked in water
1  salt

In a 5-to 6-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high
heat; add potatoes.  Cover and simmer over low heat until potatoes
are tender when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and chill.

Soak the onions about 15 minutes in cold water to cover. Drain and mix
onions with rice vinegar.  Cut potatoes in quarters; add to onions.

Trim tender watercress sprigs from stems, then finely chop enough of
the course stems to make 1/2 cup (discard extras or save for other
uses). Mix chopped stems on a large oval platter with potato salad
alongside; cover and keep cool.

Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Place, skin side down, on a piece of heavy
foil. Cut foil to follow outlines of fish, leaving a 1-inch border.
Crimp edges of foil to fit up against edge of fish. Mix soy sauce
with brown sugar and brush onto the salmon fillet.

Lay fish on center of grill, not over coals or flame. Cover barbecue
(open vents for charcoal) and cook until fish is barely opaque in
thickest part (cut to test), 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer fish to
platter with salad. Add salt to taste.  Serve hot or cold.

Grilled Swordfish On Herbed Couscous W/Vegeta

seafood

1  vegetable minestrone:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  clove garlic, pressed or
1  minced
2 cup finely diced vegetables
1  (such as yellow squash,
1  zucchini, onion, red bell
1  pepper)
1 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
1  leaves
1  11.5 oz can v-8 juice
1/4 cup fat-free chicken stock
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1  herbed couscous:
1 1/2 cup fat-free chicken stock
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1  bay leaf
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
1  leaves
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup couscous
1  swordfish:
1 1/2 lb fresh swordfish (4 6-oz
1  pieces)
1  sprigs of fresh thyme or
1  rosemary, for garnish (opt.)

To make the vegetable minestrone, heat the oil in a large saucepan
over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook just until it starts to
sizzle; do not brown. Add the herbs, juice, stock and peper and bring
to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes. Set aside.

To make the couscous, combine the stock, pepper, herbs and oil in a
small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the couscous, mix well and
remove from the heat. Cover tightly and allow to stand for at least 5
minutes, or until all of the liquid has been absorbed. Set aside.

Wash the swordfish and pat it dry.  Rub the surface with a little
olive oil and sprinkle with salt, freshly ground black pepper and
herbs, if desired. Cook over a charcoal grill or under a broiler just
until it turns from translucent to opaque, about 3 to 4 minutes per
side. Do not overcook or the fish will become tough.

To serve, place a rounded 1/2 cup of couscous on each of 4 plates and
top with a piece of grilled swordfish. Spoon the minestrone around
each serving, dividing it equally. Garnish each serving with a sprig
of fresh thyme or rosemary, if desired.

Grilled Teriyaki Swordfish

japanese, seafood

4  fresh swordfish steaks
1/2 cup light soy sauce
1/4 cup pineapple juice (no sugar added)
1/4 cup sherry
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1  clove garlic minced or pressed
2 teaspoon lemon juice

In a non-reactive bowl, combine the soy sauce, pineapple juice,
sherry, brown sugar, ginger and lemon juice. Place in heavy plastic

easily with fork). Serve with lightly grilled slices of pineapple and
baked sweet potatoes.

Grilled Tuna Fish With Avocado & Tomato Salsa

fish

10  cherry tomatoes
1  red pepper
1  green chilli (or to taste)
1  ripe, firm avocado
1  olive oil
1  salt and pepper
4  tuna steaks, cut from the belly
2 tablespoon chopped chives
1 tablespoon coriander leaves
2  lemons or limes

Roughly chop the tomatoes, pepper and chilli and place in a bowl. Cut
the avocado in half and, with your hand wrapped in a tea towel for
protection, hold the half with the stone in it. Lightly tap the stone
with a sharp knife so that the blade lodges in the stone. Twist the
knife and the stone should come away easily. Slice the flesh from
both halves into chunks and add to the chopped ingredients. Pour over
a generous amount of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and set
aside.

Grill the tuna steaks for two minutes on each side, or longer if you
don't want them too underdone. Remember that the fish will continue
cooking a little even when you remove it from the heat. Season with
salt and pepper on both sides and allow to rest in a warm oven.

To serve, divide the salsa equally on four plates, place the tuna
steaks on top, sprinkle with the chives and coriander and serve with
half a lemon or lime.

Grilled Tuna Salad With Wasabi Dressing

fish, salads

1 tablespoon soy sauce (+ 2 teaspoons)
1 tablespoon olive oil (+ 2 teaspoons)
1 1/4 lb fresh tuna steak
4 teaspoon wasabi powder *
2 tablespoon tahini * (sesame paste)
2 tablespoon rice vinegar

oil. Add the tuna and coat well. Refrigerate for about 15 minutes,
turning fish twice.

Light grill or preheat broiler.  In small bowl, mix wasabi powder

Grilled Tuna With Olive-Rosemary Butter

fish

1/4 cup butter, unsalted; room temp
1 tablespoon kalamata olives; pitted, chopped or brine-
1 tablespoon lemon juice; plus 1/4 ts
2 teaspoon rosemary, fresh; chopped or
1/2 teaspoon rosemary, dried; crumbled
1/4 teaspoon dijon mustard
3 tablespoon olive oil
1/8 teaspoon pepper
4  tuna steak, 1 thick (about 8 ounces; each)
1  rosemary sprig, fresh; (opt)

Blend butter, olives, 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon rosemary
and mustard in small bowl.  (Butter can be prepared up to 2 days
ahead. Wrap tightly and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 45
minutes before continuing.)

Whisk olive oil with remaining 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice,
remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary and pepper in shallow dish. Arrange
tuna steaks in dish, turning to caot both sides. Let stand 15 minutes.

Prepare barbecue (high heat).  Grill tuna until just cooked through,
about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to platter. Place 1 tablespoon
rosemary butter on each steak. Garnish with rosemary sprigs.

Note from author:  A simple, sunny dish with the flavors of the south
of France.  The seasoned butter is our bonus, since the fish is
already delicious after its quick marinating in a rosemary
vinaigrette. Add a sliced tomato salad and buttered orzo (rice-shaped
pasta) for a satisfying meal.  Finish with freshing lemon sorbet.

Gumbo - Cajun Style

fish, seafood

2 tablespoon lard; or shortening
2 tablespoon flour
1 large onion; chopped
2  garlic cloves; minced
1/2 cup chopped celery
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1  green pepper; chopped
1 can tomato puree (12 oz)
1 cup water
1 can tuna; drained and flaked
1 can tiny shrimp (7oz); drained
1 teaspoon file' powder
1  steamed rice

Guaranteed to conjure up dreams of moss-draped oaks and the bayou.
This was developed with the help of a Cajun friend's memory of
watching his mama cook it every Friday night when he was a boy in
Louisiana. Making a "roux" with the flour and lard is the most
important part and the secret of a good gumbo.  Be careful and don't
let it burn.

In a heavy pan, melt the lard (shortening: over very low heat. Add
flour and stir continuously until it turns a tawny brown color (it
may take as long as 15 minutes, but don't rush it because if it
burns, the gumbo will be ruined).  Now add the onion, garlic, celery,
parsley, and green pepper and braise about 5 mintues, being careful,
again, not to burn it. Add tomato puree, 1 cup water, tuna, and
shrimp and simmer for 45 minutes. Add file' powder and serve over
fluffy steam rice.

Ha Gow

appetizers, chinese, seafood

1  filling:
1  wheat starch for dusting
1/2 lb raw shrimp, peeled and chopped
1/4 lb precooked salad shrimp, chopped
2 oz pork fat, chopped fine
1/4 cup bamboo shoots, chopped
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon chopped green onion
1  egg white
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1  dough:
2 tablespoon potato starch
1 cup wheat starch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup boiling water, plus
3 tablespoon boiling water
1 teaspoon lard

Place all filling ingredients in a bowl and mix well, by hand until
the ingredients form a smooth and rather firm stuffing. This will
take about 2 minutes. Dough: Measure both starches and salt into a
small mixing bowl. Quickly pour the boiling water into the starches
while stirring with chopsticks until you get a partially cooked
dough. Do not overwork the dough. Quickly add the lard in little
pinches and then knead until smooth. When the dough is smooth, after
about 2 minutes' kneading, cover it with the mixing bowl and allow it
to rest for 15 minutes before shaping. To shape the dumplings, pull
just a bit more than 1 tsp of dough from the ball.  Keep the
remainder of the dough covered with the bowl. Roll the small amount
into a ball and place onto a floured marble board. Roll out into a
circle about 3 inches in diameter. Place 1 t of the shrimp filling in
the center of the circle of dough and fold over into a half-moon. Use
a tiny bit of water for sealing the edges.  Be sure to gently press
out all the air.  If you wish, you can form little pleats in the
dough for added decoration. Steam on an oiled bamboo steaming rack
for 12 minutes. From The Frugal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient Cuisines,

Haddock Duglere

fish

1 1/2 lb haddock fillets, skinned
1 oz butter
1 oz oil
2 oz flour
1 large beefsteak tomato
5 fl oz double cream
1  salt and pepper

In a large non-stick frying pan, melt the butter in the oil until it
stops sizzling. Coat fish lightly in flour and fry gently for 4
minutes each side. Peel tomato by covering it with boiling water for
30 seconds. The skin should slip off - mind your fingers, though! cut
tomato in half, scoop out seeds and cut flesh into half-inch strips.
Put these into pan with fish and cook gently for 1 minute. Take fish
out and put it on to to warm plates. Pour cream into pan and bring it
to boil - double cream won't curdle - stirring so it picks up all the
lovely fish and tomato bits. Season, then pour the sauce over the
fish. Mashed potatoes are perfect with it.

Halibut Creole(Cod May Be Used Instead)

diabetic, fish

1 1/4 lb 2 lbs halibut steaks
1  salt
1  freshly ground pepper
3 large tomatoes; peeled, seeded and choppe
1/2 cup green pepper; finely chopped
1/2 cup onion; finely chopped
6 tablespoon butter; (yah. right.)
3 tablespoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon tabasco

(For a six oz (raw) steak, I used 2 small Tomatoes, kept the green
pepper and onion the same, threw in a chopped jalopena pepper,
replaced the 6 tbsp of butter with 1 tsp margarine, and used about a
tsp of Tabasco).

Preheat the oven to 400F. Butter a shallow baking dish large enough
to hold the fish in one layer, and place the fish in it. Season with
salt and pepper to tasted and spread the tomatoes, green pepper, and
onion over the top. Melt the butter with the lemon juice and Tabasco
and drizzle it over the fish and vegetables. Bake about 25 minutes,
basting with pan juices every
10    minutes.

(My way, without the butter, with a 4 oz (cooked) portion of the
fish, and about two-thirds of the vegetables, I counted it as 4
protein choices and 1 Fruit/Vegetable choice).

1 1/4 lb halibut fillet; about 1 thi
      Butter -----sauce-------
1/3 cup roasted pecans; coarsely cru
2 tablespoon raspberry vinegar
2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoon roast garlic; peeled and pul
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 cup dry muscadine wine
1 pinch nutmeg
1 pinch salt

Recipe by: Martin Golding <martin@PLAZA.DS.ADP.COM> Heat butter in
frying pan until foaming subsides, reduce heat to medium to medium
low and fry fish five minutes per side, being careful when you turn
not to break it up.

While fish is frying, combine sauce ingredients.

When fish is done, remove to plates or serving platter. Deglaze pan
with th sauce, stirring briskly until it begins to thicken just
slightly. Pour sauc decorously over the fish, and serve.

NOTES:

Other mild, tasty vinegars could be substituted. If all you have is
wine or cider vinegars, use two Tbs of that and two Tbs of some kind
of unsweete fruit pulp or juice.

Since you don't have muscadine wine, substitute a dry
gewurtztrameiner or maybe a riesling- anything dry, with a spicy or
fruity flavor.

Other thick, firm fish ought to do. Fry it five minutes per side per
inch of thickness.

Halibut Steaks Marengo

fish

1/2 lb small mushrooms
1 1/2 cup fish stock
1/2 cup greek pitted olives (black)
4  halibut steaks, cut into 3/4 thick; slices
1  milk
1  salt
1  freshly ground white pepper
1  flour for dredging
4 tablespoon sweet butter
4 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoon finely minced shallots
6 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded & finely c; hopped
1  bouquet garni*
1 teaspoon oregano
2 tablespoon tomato paste
3/4 lb small mushrooms
1  beurre manie**
1  freshly ground black pepper
      ----GARNISH----
2 tablespoon finely minced parsley
1 teaspoon finely minced fresh garlic
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon rind
      ----OPTIONAL----
12  new potatoes, cooked & buttered

* BOUQUET GARNI - In a piece of cheesecloth, tie the following: 3 to 4
sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 t dry
thyme.  Leave the string long enough to hang the garni in the pot and
tie the string to the pot handle for easy removal. ** Beurre Manie is
used to thicken sauces.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T sweet butter on a
small flat plate and blend the mixture with a fork into a very smooth
paste. Roll the paste into a ball. Wipe the mushrooms with damp paper
towels. Remove the stems and add them to the fish stock. Heat the
stock, simmer it for 15 minutes and reserve.  Poach the olives in
boiling water over low heat for 5 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and
set aside. Dip the halibut steaks into milk for 2 or 3 minutes. Dry
them with paper towels. Season the fish steaks with salt and pepper
and lightly dredge them in flour, shaking off the excess. In a large
skillet melt the butter and 2 T of oil. Add the fish steaks and brown
them well on one side. Turn them carefully with a large spatula and
brown them on the other side. Carefully remove the fish to a side
dish. To the fat remaining in the pan add the shallots. Cook over low
heat until they are soft but not browned. Add the tomatoes, salt,
pepper, Bouquet Garni and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil and
add tomato paste and the fish stock. Return the fish steaks to the
skillet. Cover it tightly and simmer on top of the stove for 20 to 25
minutes, or until the fish flakes easily. Carefully remove the steaks
to a serving platter. While the fish steaks are cooking, heat
remaining oil in a skillet. Add the mushrooms and cook them over high
heat until they are nicely browned. Do not overcook. Remove the
skillet from the heat and reserve. When the fish steaks are done,
remove them carefully to a serving platter. Strain the sauce,
pressing down well on the tomato pulp to extract all the juice.
Return the sauce to the pan and reduce it by 1/3 over high heat. Add
a Beurre Manie, a little at a time, whisking constantly until the
sauce heavily coats a spoon.  Add the mushrooms and olives, salt and
black pepper.  Remove the sauce from the heat. Remove any accumulated
juices around the fish steaks with paper towels. Pour the sauce over
the fish steaks, and keep them warm until serving time. Combine the
parsley, garlic and lemon rind and sprinkle the mixture over the fish
steaks just before serving.  Serve the fish steaks with the optional
buttered new potatoes.

Hawaiian Fish Cooking Basics

fish

1  (no ingredients)

FISH: Select 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of 3/4" thick pieces AHI, HEBI, MAHI
MAHI, ONO, OPAH, SWORDFISH, or TOMBO. (Fish may have dark-colored
sections that are stronger flavored than lighter flesh.) Cut off and
discard any skin. Rinse fish, pat dry, and cut into pieces as recipes
direct. Rub fish all over with 1 tablespoon olive oil.

TO GRILL: Place oiled fish on a greased grill 4-6" above a solid bed
of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2-3
seconds). Cook fish, turning once or twice, until done to your liking
(cut to test). For rare (still the raw color in center), allow about
3 minutes total. To cook evenly (center slightly translucent), allow
5-6 minutes total.

TO SAUTE: Place a 10-12" nonstick frying pan over high heat. When pan
is hot, add 1 teaspoon salad oil and oiled fish. (For 2 pounds fish,
cook half at a time.) Turn once or twice to brown and cook to your
liking (cut to test); drippings may scorch and smoke. For rare (still
the raw color in center), allow about 3 minutes total. To cook evenly
(center slightly translucent), allow 5-6 minutes total.

Herbed Grey Mullet

fish

2 lb grey mullet, cleaned and trimmed
1 bunch fresh parsley (good size)
1  sprig of celery leaves
2  sprigs fresh thyme
2  bay leaves
2  lemons, sliced
1 tablespoon butter
1  salt and pepper

Preheat the oven to gas mark 5, 375F, 190C. Wash the herbs and remove
the stalks from the parsley. Chop the parsley leaves coarsely and put
them on one side. Chop the parsley stalks, celery leaves and thyme
and mix with the bay leaves. Stuff the cavity of the fish with this
mixture. Oil a large sheet of kitchen foil and put a line of lemon
slices into the cavity and arrange the rest of the lemon long the top
of the fish. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle generously with
the parsley leaves and wrap the fish loosely in the foil, but make
sure the edges of the foil are tightly sealed. Put it in the oven and
bake for 45 minutes.

To serve, unwrap the foil carefully - there will be a wonderfully
herby, lemony, cloud of steam - and remove as much of the liquid that
has formed around the fish as possible. You can serve that as a sauce
on its own or boil it up briefly with either a knob of butter or a
couple of tablespoons of double cream to make it rich and special.

Lay the fish on a serving dish and serve with new potatoes.

4 cup firm white bread (italian or french; or sourdough)
1/2 cup butter
1  salt and cayenne pepper
1 pint raw oysters, well-drained
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 small onion, grated
1/2 cup whipping cream

paprika (TIP:) This dish can be made with oysters of *any* size. While
fresh ones ARE best,  thawed, frozen oysters *may* be used. If you
wish, prepare  the dish and refrigerate it for several hours before
baking. Or, on  the  other hand,  you can cut and brown the bread
cubes ahead of time. The rest can be finished in minutes, once the
bread is browned.

Remove the crusts from the bread.  Cut the bread into quarter-inch
cubes; in a large skillet, melt half the butter. Add 2 cups of bread
cubes and toss  over LOW HEAT until they're golden-brown. Sprinkle
the cubes lightly with salt and caynne, stirring constantly.

Brown the remaining cubes in the remaining butter. Sprinkle again
with the cayenne and the salt.

Cover  the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish with 1/3 of the bread
cubes; top the bread evenly with half the oysters, sprinkle with salt
and cayenne, half the lemon juice and half the onion. Cover with 1/3
of the bread cubes and sprinkle with salt,  cayenne, the rest of the
lemon juice and the onion.  Pour in the cream, and top with the last
third of the bread cubes. Sprinkle with paprika to make pretty.

Bake at 325 degrees for 25 to 35 minutes and serve *immediately*.

Hollandaise Sauce For Trout

sauces, seafood

12 tablespoon butter
3  egg yolks
2 tablespoon cold water
1  salt to taste
2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Place a skillet on the stove and add about 1/2 inch of water. Bring
the water to a simmer.  Have ready 1
1/2    quart saucepan.
Place the butter in another saucepan and place it over very low heat.
Set 1 1/2 quart saucepan in the simmering water in the skillet.
Place the egg yolks in the saucepan.  Add the cold water, salt and 1
tsp. lemon juice.  Start beating the egg yolks with a wire whisk,
stirring in a back and forth circular fashion, making certain that
the whisk covers the bottom of the saucepan so the yolks do not
stick. It is important that the heat beneath the saucepan be moderate.
When the egg yolks become custardlike and thickened, start adding the
melted butter.
Continue beating, stirring constantly and vigorously, until all the
butter is added.  Add the remaining lemon juice and cayenne.

Homard A La Normande (Lobster~ Normandy Style

french, seafood

4  fresh lobsters, live
1/2 cup sweet butter
1  salt
1  freshly ground white pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped shallots or scallion; s
12 cup calvados
3 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoon all purpose flour
1/2  lemon, juice of
1 dash cayenne pepper
2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley

Servings: 4

Split the lobsters lengthwise with a big knife and break the shells
off the claws with a hammer or a cleaver. Pour the liquid and the
tomalley (the liver) into a small bowl. Discard the stomach (the
small sac which is behind the eyes).

Melt half the butter in a large, heavy saucepan. When the butter
turns the color of a hazelnut, add the lobsters and sprinkle with
salt and pepper. Cook over high heat for eight to 10 minutes, turning
lobsters often. They should turn evenly red all over. Remove the
lobsters from the saucepan. Arrange in a large roasting pan and place
in a preheated 250-F oven to keep them warm and to finish cooking.

Add the shallots to the saucepan and sizzle exactly 1 minute without
burning. Add the Calvados, ignite, and when the flame dies out, add
the cream. Work together the remaining butter and the flour. When the
sauce starts boiling, add the flour mixture (beurre manie), bit by
bit, whipping vigorously into the sauce with a wire whisk until
smooth. Bring slowly to a boil. Then mix in the tomalley and lemon
juice. Taste for seasoning and add salt and cayenne pepper, if
necessary. You may cook a bit longer to reduce the sauce if you like
it thicker. Stir in the parsley. Pour the sauce over the lobsters and
serve piping hot.

A rice pilaf is usually served with this dish, and we would recommend
a chilled white Traminer wine or a bottle of old cider.

Home-Smoked Salmon

fish

1 lb salmon fillets or steaks
1  alderwood chips
1  chimney smoker

This is a method rather than a recipe.  The key is to use alderwood, a
hardwood found in the Pacific Northwest, as the smoking wood. It is my
understanding that in the PacNW, smokehouses and seafood grills use
GREEN alder twigs, but such things aren't available on the East Coast.

Ready a chimney smoker (I made one out of a galvanized trashcan
several years ago, but they are currently cheaper to buy than to
make!) with a small amount of coals while soaking the alderwood
chips. When the coals are glowing hot, drain the water from the
chips, place the chips on the hot coals, get the drip catcher and the
grate in place, and put the salmon directly on the grate. Close the
lid and leave it alone for 6 to 12 hours! The fish will cook at 130
to 140 degrees, and will probably flake when removed from the grate.
This is of a different flavor and consistency than your normal
perception of smoked salmon. The fish may be served directly in small
dishes with a fresh lemon wedge and a quality toast as an appetizer,
or it can be mixed with a little cream cheese, sour cream, and lemon
juice as a spread.  Use your imagination!!!

Honey-Walnut Prawns

chinese, seafood

1/2 cup walnuts
5 cup water
1 cup sugar
2 cup oil
16 medium prawns, peeled and cleaned
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup egg whites
2 tablespoon honey
3 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/2 tablespoon condensed milk
1/2 cup oil

Here's a goody.  I normally shy away from Western influenced Chinese
recipes and would never have fixed this one on my own. It calls for
such non-Chinese things as milk and mayonnaise. My room mate fixed it
the other night though, and it was excellent.  He was trying to
duplicate a dish that he and his date had at a Chinese place a while
back and apparently, this is almost it.  Laurie suggested it would be
closer to the restaurant dish by just dusting the shrimp with
cornstarch rather than making a batter. I imagine that it would be
good either way. It certainly is good this way!

Rinse walnuts, then boil in 5 cups water, continually changing water
until clear.  When clear, boil with sugar until sugar dissolves. Heat
2 cups oil until almost smoking, then deep-fry walnuts until they're
shiny and brown, no longer golden.  Remove walnuts to cookie sheet,
let cool. Mix cornstarch and egg whites together to form a thick,
sticky texture and mix well with prawns.  Set aside.  Mix honey,
mayonnaise, lemon juice and condensed milk in a medium bowl until
smooth.

Heat oil until boiling, then deep fry prawns until golden brown.

Drain, then fold in honey-mayonnaise mixture. mix well, sprinkle with
walnuts, and arrange on platter.

Serves 4 to 6.

Hot & Cold Shrimp (Goong Kob Poh)

seafood, thai

1 kg medium size fresh shrimp
7  red hot chili
3  cloves garlic
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup hot water
2 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon hot sauce *
1 tablespoon chopped coriander
1  * (sriracha or sambel lampung) [sri; racha is a

Thai hot sauce, available here, and comes in several varieties++ from
mildly warm to blisteringly hot. Some of them are quite similar to a
thick Tabasco sauce which is what I would use for a substitute. S.C.]

Here is a recipe from my new Thai cookbook that is mainly a dip,
since the shrimp are either grilled or eaten raw with the rest of the
ingredients. I haven't made this yet, but the dip sounds quite
similar to the Vietnamese "Nuoc Cham" (which would be good also.)

Peel shrimp, remove the center black line, leave the tail on. Clean
and drain, arrange on a plate, chill for 2 hours. Pound the chili and
garlic until fine. Place into a small bowl. Mix sugar, salt and hot
water and stir until sugar is dissolved.  Pour over pounded chili and
garlic. Add lime juice and hot sauce, stir and top with chopped
coriander.

To Serve:  Thread the shrimp onto the sticks.  Cook over charcoal
until done to satisfaction.  Dip in prepared sauce to taste. It can
be served raw and cold.

Hot & Sour Shrimp With Watercress & Walnuts

fish

1 lb large uncooked shrimp, peeled, deve; ined, butterflied
4 tablespoon dry sherry
1 tablespoon grated peeled fresh ginger
1/2 cup chicken stock or canned broth
2 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoon catsup. [see note. s.c.]
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon rice vinegar or white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon oriental sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
6 tablespoon peanut oil
2 tablespoon chopped walnuts
3 bunch watercress, trimmed
2 medium bell peppers, cut into 1-inch squar; es
2  garlic cloves, minced
8  green onions, cut diagonally into 1; -inch-long pieces

This excellent recipe is a relatively quick and easy dish worthy of
gracing any restaurant's menu.  My roommate fixed it last night for
three people. It disappeared almost immediately. Although it says
that it serves four I'd say that it's about two healthy servings. Or
maybe that's just because I'm such a glutton. Spinach would be an
excellent substitution for the watercress that the recipe calls for.
Any kind of nut could be used instead of walnuts.  And rice of
course...

A light marinade of Sherry and ginger flavors the shrimp, which are
stir-fried with ted bell peppers and green onions. Watercress makes a
colorful bed for the shrimp. Offer lemon iced tea to go with the
meal. [Or any good beer.  S.C.]

Combine shrimp, 2 tablespoons Sherry and grated ginger in large bowl.
Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Mix remaining 2 tablespoons
Sherry, chicken stock, soy sauce, catsup, cornstarch, rice vinegar,
sugar, sesame oil and cayenne pepper in small bowl.

Heat 2 teaspoons peanut oil in wok or heavy large skillet over high
heat. Add walnuts and stir-fry for 1 minute. Transfer walnuts to
plate using slotted spoon. Add watercress to wok and stir-fry until
just wilted, about 1 minute.  Divide watercress among plates. Add 2
teaspoons peanut oil, bell peppers and garlic to wok and stir-fry for
1 minute. Add remaining 2 teaspoons peanut oil, shrimp mixture and
onions and stir- fry for 1 minute. Stir stock mixture, add to wok and
cook sauce until clear and thick, stirring frequently, 2 minutes.

Spoon sauce and shrimp over watercress.  Sprinkle with walnuts and
serve.

NOTE:  I used Jufran sauce rather than catsup.  Jufran is a Philippino
sauce that's looks and tastes much like catsup. It's made from
bananas and other stuff, however and has a more complex and
interesting taste. I use it in place of catsup in many recipes as
well as on hamburgers, hot dogs and corn dogs.  It comes in both mild
and hot forms. The mild is not too hot++somewhat like a spicy catsup.
The hot stuff is much hotter, although not intolerably so. If you use
this, be prudent about how much cayenne you use, at least the first
time until you can see how they balance out.

Makes four servings; about 265 calories per serving.

Hot & Spicy Shrimp

cajun, fish, main dish

1 lb butter
1/4 cup peanut oil
3  cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoon rosemary
1 teaspoon chopped basil
1 teaspoon chopped thyme
1 teaspoon chopped oregano
1  small hot pepper chopped or
2 tablespoon ground cayenne pepper
2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
2  bay leaves, crumbled
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoon lemon juice
2 lb raw shrimp in their shells
1  salt

Shrimp should be of a size to number 30-35 per pound. Melt the butter
and oil in a flameproof baking dish.
Add the garlic, herbs, peppers, bay leaves, paprika, and lemon
juice, and bring to a boil.  Turn the heat down and simmer 10
minutes, stirring frequently. Remove the dish from the heat and let
the flavors marry at least 30 minutes.  This hot butter sauce can be
made a day in advance and refrigerated.
Preheat the oven to 450F.  Reheat the sauce, add the shrimp, and
cook over medium heat until the shrimp just turn pink, then bake in
the oven about 30 minutes more. Taste for seasoning, adding salt if
necessary. Nathalie Dupree writes of this recipe in her book "New
Southern Cooking," "Shrimp taste better when cooked in their shells
because the fat under the shells preserves their flavor and
tenderness. When the shells are crisp it is a pleasure to eat the
shrimp with their shells on. This rich butter sauce cries out to be
sopped up with crusty bread once the shrimp are gone."

These dashes are then put into MM as extra ingredients lines starting

Hot Red Snapper Soup (Korean Domi Chigae)

fish, korean, soups

1/4 lb lean beef (shoulder)
1 1/2 lb red snapper
2  scallions
2  cloves garlic
1/2  cake bean curd
2 cup water
2 tablespoon kochu chang

A chigae is usually a hot soup comprised of several ingredients. In
this case, meat has been cooked with fish, the one to impart body,
the other to add flavor. Kochu Chang is red bean paste, which may be
purchased at many Oriental food stores. If it is not available,
Japanese miso sauce may be substituted.

1.  Shred the beef into 2-inch lengths. Cut the red snapper across
the body into 1 1/2-inch widths, leaving the bones inside. Cut the
scallions into 2-inch cubes.

2.  Arrange the pieces of fish on the bottom of a pot. Add the
scallions, then the beef. Now add the garlic. Mix the kochu chang
with water and pour it over the other ingredients. Bring to a boil,
then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Just before serving

1 lb sea scallops
1/3 cup salad oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
2 tablespoon lime juice
2 teaspoon minced fresh marjoram leaves
1 teaspoon dried marjoram leaves
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onion

remaining scallops; add to bowl. Drain juices from scallops back into
frying pan; bring to a boil; then remove from heat. Stir in lime
juice, marjoram, sugar, pepper, and onion.

Huachinango A La Veracruzana

mexican, seafood

1  snapper, 3 lb
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon lime juice
2 lb tomato
1/4 cup olive oil
1  onion; finely sliced
2  garlic clove
1  bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon oregano
12  olive, green; halved
2 tablespoon capers
2  jalape¤os en escabeche
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon olive oil

Slice the onions finely.  Peel and slice the garlic. Cut the
jalape¤os into strips.  Set them all aside.

Clean the fish, leaving the head and tail on.  Prick the fish on both
sides with a coarse-tined fork, rub in the salt and lime juice, and
set aside in the dish to season for about two hours.

Skin, seed, and chop the tomatoes roughly.  Set them aside.

Heat the oil and fry the onion and garlic, without browning, until
they are soft.  Add the tomatoes, with the bay leaf, oregano, olives,
capers, jalape¤os, and salt to the pan and cook the sauce over a
brisk flame until it is well seasoned and some of the juice has
evaporated--about ten minutes.  Pour the sauce over the fish.

Sprinkle the olive oil over the sauce and bake the fish for about
twenty minutes, uncovered, on one side. Turn the fish over and
continue baking it until it is just tender--about 30 minutes. Baste
the fish frequently with the sauce during the cooking time.

Hurry Tuna~ Please

cassarole, seafood

1  large 12-1/2-ounce can white
1  or light meat tuna, drained
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  apple; cored and chopped
1 small onion; chopped
1/2 teaspoon curry
3 tablespoon flour
1/2 cup milk
1 cup chicken bouillon; (that's one cube of bouil
1  (8-ounce) package egg
1  noodles; cooked & drained
1  or
1 cup cooked rice

THIS MEAL IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WRECK AND QUICK TO MAKE

Fry the apple and onion in a little oil until lightly cooked. Add
flour and slowly stir in milk and bouillon. That will make a lumpy
white sauce.  (The lumps are from the apple and onions and are not
your fault.) Add tuna, breaking it up well, and sprinkle in the
curry. Mix well. Serve over hot noodles which take nine minutes to
cook and should have been started back while the apples and onions
were cooking. If time is not a problem, serve this over rice.  (Now
that should have been started BEFORE the apples and onions.)

Irish Cream Of Mussel Soup

fish, soups

32 medium mussels
1  onion; peeled/chopped
1  celery; chopped
1  leek (white part only); chop
1 cup white wine
3 cup fish stock
2 cup heavy cream
4  chervil or substitute parsle
1  salt and pepper to taste

Note: When buying mussels look for small ones that have tightly closed
shells - a sign that they are alive and thus fresher.
Place mussels, wine and fish stock in a stock pot. Add chopped
vegetables. Cover and shake to stir contents. Cook on high heat 4 to
5 minutes. After 5 minutes shake pot again, remove lid and strain
contents into a collander, catching liquid in a bowl. Then strain
soup liquid again through a wire mesh strainer into a saucepan. Over
high heat, boil and reduce soup for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, remove the mussel meat from most of the shells, leaving
some mussel shells intact for serving as a side dish with the chopped
vegetables.
Pour the heavy cream into reduced soup. Whisk while maintaining the
high heat. Add mussel meat slowly. Whisk gently. Then continue to
stir with a soup ladle until it boils.
Ladle soup into soup bowls. Add sprigs of chervil to top of soup for
garnish.
Serve the remaining mussels on the side with an array of the cooked
chopped vegetables.

Italian Fish Soup

italian, seafood, soup/stew

1/2 cup olive oil
3  leeks, cleaned and sliced, white pa; rt only
2  cloves of garlic diced fine
1  yellow onion, peeled and chopped
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced
6 cup fish stock, clam nectar or water
1 cup italian tomato sauce
1 cup dry white wine (maybe soave)
1  cayenne pepper to taste
1 lb white fish boneless fillet, cut int; o small pieces
1  (cod, seabass, monkfish)
2 lb combined, of any or all of {the fol; lowing:
1  clams, soaked in fresh water 1 hour; then drained
1  crab,
1  shrimp,
1  mussels, scrubbed with the beards r; emoved

Serves 8

(don't leave these out they are cheap, tasty and attractive) You can
buy a 1/4 or 1/2 lb. of several items. Even if shrimp is $6 per lb.
1/4 lb. is affordable and will add flavor and variety.

Chopped parsley for garnish

Saute the leeks, onions, celery, garlic and mushrooms until the
onions are clear. Add the stock, nectar or water, tomato sauce and
white wine. Bring to a heavy simmer and taste. Add the cayenne pepper
and salt to taste.

Prepare the seafood and add to the pot, remembering to add first those
things which take longest to cook. The various shellfish go in with
the shells on.

Simmer until done. Serve in large bowls over spaghetti. By adding
extra fish such as a lobster per person this will become a meal
instead of a soup.

Jalapeno Pasta With Scallop Sauce

main dish, pasta, sauces, seafood

      ----JALAPENO PASTA----
2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup semolina flour
5 large eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 teaspoon jalapenos; pureed
1 each pinch salt
      ----SCALLOP SAUCE----
2 tablespoon olive oil
2 each garlic cloves; mashed-minced
2 lb sea scallops; cleaned
1 tablespoon fresh cilantro; minced
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 1/2 cup dry white wine

Jalapeno Pasta: In a large mixing bowl, place all of the ingredients
and knead them with an electric mixer, (or use a dough hook), for 10
minutes, or until a soft dough is formed. On a flat, floured surface,
roll out the dough so that is is 1/8 inch thick. Cut the dough
lengthwise into 1/4 inch wide strips. Hang the strips over a wooden
rod, like a broom handle, for 2 hours (minimum) so that they dry.
Cook the pasta al dente and drain it. Serve it with the Scallop Sauce
on top.

Scallop Sauce: In a large skillet place the olive oil and heat it on
medium high until it's hot. Add the garlic and saute it for 45
seconds, or until it begins to turn brown. Add the sea scallops and
cook them on 1 side for 1 minute. Remove the scallops and place them
on a warm plate. To the skillet add the cilantro, tarragon and white
wine. Cook the ingredients for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is
reduced by half. Add the scallops (place the uncooked sides down in
the pan) and cook them for 4 minutes.

Jambalaya Alaskan-Style

fish, main dish

1/4 lb bacon; chopped
2  garlic cloves; minced
1 medium onion; chopped
1 medium green pepper; chopped
1/4 lb hot reindeer polish sausage - cut i; n 1/4 slices
1/4 lb reindeer polish sausage  (regular); - cut in 1/4 slices
1 tablespoon parsley
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1  lemon pepper seasoning
1  salt
1  pepper
2 cup beef or chicken broth
1 dash tabasco sauce
1 1/4 cup long-grain rice
1 1/2 cup fresh or frozen shrimp - cooked

Saute bacon, garlic, onion and green pepper 2 to 3 minutes in large
skillet or kettle. Add hot and regular sausages. Saute until onion is
translucent but not golden. Add parsley, thyme, lemon pepper, salt
and pepper. Add broth and tabasco sauce; bring to a boil and boil
five minutes. Add rice, cover and simmer 20 minutes until rice is
tender but not mushy. Stir in shrimp and heat until just heated
through. Serves 4. Serve with a cool, tangy coleslaw and plenty of
cold beer-or something else to quench the fire! Those with timid
palates may want to substitute regular sausage for the hot; those
with cast-iron palates can use all hot sausage or add tabasco sauce
to taste. This recipe is moderately hot.

Jansson's Frestelse (Jansson's Temptation)

cassarole, seafood, side dish, swedish

7 medium boiling potatoes; peeled & cut into 2 x 1/4
2 1/2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 large (to 3) yellow onions; thinly sliced (4 cups)
16  flat anchovy fillets; drained
1  white pepper
2 tablespoon fine dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoon butter; cut into 1/4 bits
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup milk

Preheat oven to 400øF.  Place the potato strips in cold water to keep
them from discoloring. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons
of oil in a 10-12" skillet; when the foam subsides, add the onions
and cook 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are soft but not
brown.

With a pastry brush or paper towels, spread a 1 1/2 to 2-quart
souffle or baking dish with the remaining half tablespoon of butter.
Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels. Arrange a
layer of potatoes on the bottom of the dish and then alternate layers
of onions and anchovies ending with potatoes. Sprinkle each layer
with a little white pepper. Scatter bread crumbs over the top layer
of potatoes and dot the casserole with the 2 tablespoons of butter
cut into bits. In a small saucepan, heat the milk and cream until it
barely simmers, then pour over potatoes.

Bake in the center of the oven for 45 minutes or until the potatoes
are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer and
the liquid is nearly absorbed.

.\\ichele's notes: I hate anchovies. With a passion. But this is one
of the best dishes I ever had. The cream and milk leech the salty
anchovy taste right out and it turns into what can only be described
as heaven. A definite Swedish Christmas staple at our house!

Jar Yue Har Guen (Deep-Fried Fish & Prawn R

chinese, seafood

12  raw prawns
500 gm (1 lb) fish fillets (see note)
1  egg, beaten with 1 tb. water
1/4 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  plain flour
1  dry breadcrumbs
1  oil for frying

Shell and de-vein prawns.  Using a sharp knife, skin the fish fillets.
Depending on the size of the fillets, they may be cut into two, three
or four strips. Wrap each strip around a prawn and fasten with a
wooden toothpick. Mix egg with ginger and salt.  Dip fish rolls into
plain flour, then into beaten egg and finally into breadcrumbs.

Heat about half cup oil in wok.  When it starts to form a haze add
fish rolls, about 6 at a time.  Fry until golden brown all over,
approximately 3 minutes. Drain on absorbent paper. Fry remaining
rolls. Serve hot with soy or chilli sauce for dipping. Note: Choose
flat fillets of firm white fish. They should be thin, for they have
to be rolled around the prawns.

Jellyfish Daikon & Chicken Breasty Salad

chinese, fish

1/2 lb dried, salted whole jellyfish
1  1-pound daikon radish
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 large chicken breast
1/2  egg white
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon dry sherry
3 tablespoon peanut oil
2 tablespoon sesame oil
3  scallions, chopped

Here's a classic Chinese "texture" dish, a cold salad made of with
dried jellyfish.  I know jellyfish sounds bizarre, but, after
soaking, the jellyfish has a texture similar to woodears-crunchy and
crisp with little taste of its own.  I consider the addition of the
chicken to be a sop to those who like to see recognizable things in
their food...

Actually, this would probably be quite good with just the chicken or
just the jellyfish.  It has a light dressing made of mixed oils and
wine. Very nice on a hot summers day. More than likely, you'll have
to go to a Chinese market to get the jellyfish.  This is another
recipe from my huge pile of clippings.  It's from the SF Chronicle,
but I don't know the date.

Soak the jellyfish in a large bowl of cold water for 24 hours,
changing the water a couple of times.  Peel the daikon with a
vegetable peeler; slice thinly; stack slices and cut into matchstick
shreds. Put into a mixing bowl, toss with the 2 teaspoons of salt and
let stand 1 hour.

Meanwhile, drain water from jellyfish.  Pour boiling water over the
jellyfish and let stand for 15 seconds. Drain and run under cold
water. Set aside.

Bone the chicken breast and slice thinly; cut slices into shreds. Mix
chicken with the egg white, cornstarch and teaspoon of sesame oil;
refrigerate for
30    minutes.

While the chicken is marinating, cut jellyfish into the thinnest
possible shreds by rolling up each sheet and slicing it thinly. Place
in a large bowl.  Wring most of the moisture from the daikon shreds;
add to the bowl with the jellyfish.  Heat 3 cups water in a saucepan.
When boiling, turn off the heat and add the chicken shreds, stirring
to separate the pieces. Simmer for 1 minute.  Drain and rinse under
cold water. Drain and add to the bowl with the jellyfish.

Blend the salt and sugar with the wine until they dissolve. Heat the
oils in a saucepan and add the seasoned wine. It will sputter and
evaporate. When the oil is hot++don't let it smoke++turn off the heat
and add the scallions.  Cool.  Toss with the salad just before
serving.

Jhinka Masala (Bengal Lancers Shrimp Curry)

seafood

1  stephen ceideburg
1 lb medium shrimp, peeled, deveined, ta; ils left on
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
4  whole garlic cloves, peeled
1  half-inch piece fresh ginger, peele; d
2  dried red chiles, stemmed
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoon mustard oil or light olive oil
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 1/2 cup chopped tomato
1/4 cup to 1/2 cup water
1  freshly cooked basmati or long-grai; n rice

This dish was popular with the Bengal Lancers regiment around the
turn of the century. For a change of pace, try it over pasta or
Indian basmati rice.

Sprinkle shrimp with salt and turmeric. Toss well to coat; cover and
set aside for 15 minutes.

Combine mustard, cumin, garlic, ginger, chiles and lemon juice in a
blender and puree. Set aside.

Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions
and cook until soft, about 3 minutes.

Add pureed spice mixture. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 5
minutes.

Stir in tomato and cook until soft. Add shrimp, stir gently to coat
them evenly.

Pour in the water and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.

Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until shrimp are just opaque,
about
5    minutes.

Mound rice into heated serving plates. Spoon curry over and serve.

Note: Basmati rice has a distinctive nutty flavor. It is available at
Indian, Middle Eastern, some specialty food stores and supermarkets.

Jiggs Dinner

fish, main dish

1 x no ingredients

Take a large piece of salt meat and soak in cold water overnight.
Next, place fresh water in the pot and boil salt meat on the stove
with a small amount of salt pork for 45 minutes or longer. While that
is boiling, prepare your vegetables.  Cut turnip in small pieces,
peel carrots, potatoes and prepare cabbage.  Add vegetables to the
boiling pot, beginning with turnips, then carrots, cabbage and lately
the potatoes, allowing 15 minutes between each vegetable. Cook until
the potatoes are done.

If cooking for your own family, a cup of peas placed in a cloth and
tied to a string may be hung in the pot to cook with your salt meat
dinner before the vegetables are placed in. They should be soaked in
cold water first, though.

Justin Wilson's Boiled Crawfish

seafood

4  boxes salt (no size mentione
6  pouches crab boil
9  lemons
8 oz cayenne pepper
5 lb small white onions
1  garlic
24  small potatoes
1  smoked sausage
1  corn
50 lb live crawfish

Bring seasonings to boil for 10 minutes.  Add potatoes, corn, and
smoked sausage.  Boil for another 10 minutes. Add crawfish. Bring
back to boil. Cut fire off immediately. Let soak for 20 to 30
minutes. Drain. Peel and eat.
While water is coming to a boil, cull and clean crawfish. Rinse
well with garden hose and remove any dead ones.
Always wear gloves when you fool with crawfish, but remember,
they can still pinch you through gloves. Justin Wilson writes, "Not
everybody likes the fat, but I do, and I love to dig my finger into
the head and scoop it out.  During crawfish season, my finger stays
yellow from one end to the other." From Justin Wilson's "Outdoor

vegetables before discarding the fibers remaining in
the sieve.  Return the soup stock to the pot and bring
to a boil.

Meanwhile, lightly salt the fish and let stand for 10
minutes, then rinse with water and lower into soup,
adding water only if needed to cover the fish.  Lower
the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, then add the
lobster. Cover and simmer 5 minutes longer, then add
the shrimp and scallops or mussels and simmer an
additional 10 minutes.  Taste and adjust the
seasonings.

Arrange the toast slices in large soup plates.  Serve
the varied fishes and broth in each bowl, hot, with
croutons in a separate plate.

NOTE: Kakavia is frequently made in the following
variation: Cook 2 to 3 fish with the vegetables and
strain with the vegetables to make a thicker stock.
Continue to cook the remaining seafood as described
above.

Kalamaria Parayemista

appetizers, greek, main dish, seafood

1 kg small squid
1/2 cup corn oil
1 medium onion; finely chopped
1/2 cup short-grain rice
1/2 cup tomato puree
1/4 cup water
1 small cinnamon stick
2  cloves
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup dry white wine

Select squid with hoods about 10-12 cm (4-5 inches)
long.

To clean squid, pull off head and attached tentacles.
Cut out eyes and beak and discard.  Clean dark skin
from head and tentacles by pulling it off or rubbing
off with a cloth dipped in coarse salt. Rinse, chop 3
to 4 into small pieces and keep aside.  Remainder may
be stored and fried later.

Clean out hood (body) and remove transparent backbone
from inside. Pull or rub off skin.  Rinse well, drain
and dry.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan and gently fry onion
until transparent. Stir in rice and stir over heat for
2 minutes. Add tomato puree, water, cinnamon stick,
cloves, chopped squid, and salt and pepper to taste.
Cover and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes or until
liquid is absorbed. Remove cinnamon stick and cloves.

Fill hoods with rice mixture, packing it in loosely as
rice expands and hoods contract during cooking.  Close
top with wooden cocktail picks or sew with strong
thread.

Heat remaining oil in a deep pan and fry squid hoods
until lightly coloured, turning them frequently.
Reduce heat, add wine, cover and simmer gently on low
heat for 1 hour or until squid is tender. Add a little
water to pan if necessary during cooking. Serve hot or
warm as a mezethaki (appetizer).

Kare Ikan (Fish Curry)

indonesian, seafood

1 1/2  lb, cleaned weight fish
6  shallots or
1 large onion
2  cloves garlic
2 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon powdered lemon grass or
1  blade fresh, lemon grass
1 teaspoon chilli powder
1  salam leaf or bay-leaf
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 cup tamarind water
1 cup of thick santen (coconut milk)
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  salt
1 slice cucumber
1  mint

Fish curry is the literal translation of kare Ikan;
but I should explain that Indonesian 'curry' is rather
different from Indian curries. The recipe may be used
for almost any fish.  In the former version of this
book I suggested salmon steaks, which it suits well;
but these are now rather expensive.  It is better to
select a white fish with firm flesh, such as haddock,
angler-fish, swordfish or dogfish.  In Australia the
various fish known as whiting would be a good choice.
Americans might like to use snappers. Whatever fish is
used, it can be cut into small cubes or slices before
frying.  Heat a little oil in a heavy frying-pan, and
carefully brown the fish in it. Meanwhile, in another
frying-pan, fry the chopped shallots (or onion) and
garlic until tender. Stir in the chilli, ginger,
turmeric, coriander, lemon grass, salam, salt and
tamarind water. Let this mixture simmer for 10
minutes, then put in the fish. Cover, and simmer for
another 10 minutes.  Add the santen and cook for a
further 5 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with very thin
slices of cucumber and chopped mint. (Alternatively,
put the cucumber and mint into the kare itself for the
last 2 minutes of cooking.) Incidentally, the same
kare can be made with prawns. There is no need to fry
the prawns separately; but fry them in the mixture of
onion, etcetera for a few minutes before you put in
the tamarind water. Makes 4 servings. From "Indonesian
Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London,

Karrysalat (Curried Macaroni & Herring Salad)

dressings, pasta, salads, seafood

1 small cucumber; peeled & halved lengthwis
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup uncooked elbow macaroni
1  pickled or matjes herring (2 fillet; s)
2  mushrooms; raw, thin sliced
2 tablespoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
      ----DRESSING----
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 cup sour cream
2 1/2 teaspoon curry powder

Scrape out and discard the seeds from the halved
cucumber with a teaspoon and slice the halves into
1/2" cubes. Place these cubes in a small bowl and
sprinkle with salt to draw out their excess moisture.
Let the cubes stand 15 minutes, then drain and pat
them dry with paper towels.
Cook the macaroni in rapidly boiling salted water for
20 minutes, following the directions on the package.
Meanwhile, wash the herring fillets in cold water, pat
them dry with paper towels and cut them into 1-1/2"
lengths. Drain the cooked macaroni in a colander, run
cold water over it to cool it, then spread out on
paper towels to get rid of any excess moisture.
Place the cut-up herring in a salad bowl along with
the cucumber, macaroni and sliced raw mushrooms. In a
separate bowl, beat together the vinegar, olive oil,
salt and pepper with a small wire whisk and pour this
mixture over the ingredients in the salad bowl. With 2
wooden spoons, mix the salad thoroughly but gently.
Refrigerate the salad for 1 to 2 hours before serving.
DRESSING: For a richer dressing, preferred by the
Danes, whip the mayonnaise,
sour cream and curry powder together in a small bowl
and add to the salad just before serving.

stand the stuff).

Here's a rough guideline to go by (I tend to make tuna
salad with whatever's on hand, so it varies a LOT):

Drain a can of water-packed tuna, and dump into a
bowl.  Add a couple of hardboiled eggs, chopped, maybe
a half of a chopped green Bell pepper, half a chopped
red Bell pepper, a couple of green onions, finely
minced, a rib of celery, including a generous portion
of leaves, finely minced, sometimes a few chopped
green or black olives. Moisten the mixture with either
a good oil and vinegar dressing, or a few tablespoons
of your favorite fat-free Italian dressing.

This makes a good filling for pita bread.

If you like, you can turn this into a dinner salad by
adding cooked pasta (rotini, elbow macaroni, whatever
suits your fancy).  I've also tossed in chopped
artichoke hearts on occasion (in which case, the
marinade from the artichokes, plus a little vinegar
becomes the dressing.

If I want a really SERIOUS salad, I'll also toss in
some thawed but uncooked frozen mixed vegetables (the
Italian-type mixes are particularly good). Garnish
with sliced cucumber, maybe some radish roses or
whatever.

Keitetyt Ravut (Dill-Flavored Crayfish)

appetizers, main dish, seafood

3 quart cold water
1/4 cup salt
3 tablespoon dill seed
3 large bunches dill; fresh
30  crayfish; fresh-water, live
      ----GARNISH----
1 bunch dill
1  toasted white bread

"Scandinadian crayfish are small - about 3 inches in
length - and are similar to the fresh-water crayfish
of the Midwestern, Southern and Western United States.
The Finns are extremely fond of these delicate
shellfish and easily eat 10 to 20 apiece - usually
accompanied by chilled vodka."
In a 6-8 quart kettle, combine the water, salt, dill
seed and 2 of the bunches of fresh dill ties with a
string. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil
briskly, uncovered for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, wash the
crayfish carefully under cold running water. Drop
them, a few at a time, into the rapidly boiling water.
When all of the crayfish have been added, cover the
kettle tightly and boil about 6 or 7 minutes. Line a
2-3 quart bowl with the sprigs of the third bunch of
fresh dill. Remove the crayfish from the kettle with a
slotted spoon and arrange them in the bowl over the
dill sprigs. Strain the stock over the crayfish
through a fine sieve and let them rest in the liquid
until they have reached room temperature. Then cover
the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for
at least 12 hours; they may marinate as long as 2 days
if you wish. To serve, drain the crayfish of their
liquid, pile them high on a platter and garnish with
fresh dill. Although they can be served cold, the
crayfish are at their best if they are allowed to
reach room temperature. Serve with toast.

Kennet Fried Trout

seafood

2 small trout, (6-8 oz each)
2  rashers streaky bacon
1 tablespoon (heaped) coarse oatmeal
2 oz unsalted or clarified butter
1  lemon
1  a little plain flour

Rub the skins of the cleaned and dried trout very
gently with a good grinding of pepper - this makes the
rich skin deliciously piquant when crisply fried -
then dust lightly with flour and salt.  Warm a frying
pan large enough to take the two fish.  Toast the
oatmeal in it, or, for a richer dish, fry it.  Remove
and reserve.  Cut the bacon into snippets; fry gently
until the fat runs, then increase heat to crisp the
bacon a little. Remove and keep hot.  Dice the butter
and add 1-1/2 oz of it to the pan. When the butter
foam dies down add the fish.  Press them down lightly
to ensure they lie very flat, touching the pan base
everywhere. After 4-5 minutes steady cooking in the
bubbling butter, the skin on the underside of the fish
should be crisp and golden brown.  Turn them carefully
and fry on the second side in the same way.  Put the
cooked fish on to warmed plates, scatter the bacon and
oatmeal over them and keep hot.

Wipe out the pan with kitchen paper.  Melt the
remaining butter and cook to a rich shade of gold.
Quickly add generous 1 teaspoon lemon juice and a
little salt and pepper.  Swirl to mix well, pour over
the trout and serve immediately with wedges of lemon.

Khao-Tung Hna-Tung (Crusty Rice With Shrimp D

appetizers, seafood, thai

2 cup long grain rice.
6 cup water.
      ----DIP----
1 cup raw shrimp (ground/chopped).
3 cup coconut milk. *
1/2 cup shallots or onions, chopped.
2 tablespoon cilantro roots & stem, mash.
2 tablespoon garlic, chopped.
2 tablespoon tomato paste.
1/2 cup peanuts, crushed fine.
3 tablespoon fish sauce.
1/4 cup sugar.
1  cilantro leaves, chopped.
1  fresh red chili peppers.

* 3 cups of coconut milk can be made fresh, if
desired, by mixing 1 pound of grated, fresh coconut
meat with 2-1/2 cups of hot (not boiling) water. Mix
well, and work the mixture bu hands.  Strain and
squeeze out resulting liquid and discard the meat. TO
MAKE BASIC "CRUSTY RICE": Wash rice, if needed, and
put into a pot or sauce pan. Add the 6 cups of water
and put on medium heat till the rice is thoroughly
cooked and the water had almost totally evaporated.
Take the pot of rice off the heat and put aside to
cool (rice should resemble a "soggy mess"). Lightly
coat a shallow tray or cookie sheet with oil, add some
of the cooked rice and spread into a thin layer.  You
may need several trays, depending on their size.  Put
the tray(s) out to dry in the sun (or into a warm
oven). When the rice starts to dry (but not yet fully
dry), use a knife to cut the sheet of rice into 2"-3"
squares. Turn the pieces over and continue to dry
thoroughly. The squares of crusty rice can now be
either deep fried till lightly browned, or toasted.
If fried, drain well.  They can be stored for several
days in airtight jar. SHRIMP DIP:
Place the coconut milk into a sauce pan and add the
crushed cilantro roots/stems, chopped garlic, ground
(chopped) raw shrimp meat.  Stir well and put on
medium heat.  Stir till the coconut milk starts to
boil, and continue to cook till the shrimp meat is
cooked.  Add tomato paste and chopped shallot (onion).
Continue cooking for a few more minutes till the
shallot is cooked.  Add fish sauce, sugar, and crushed
peanuts. Bring to a second boil and take off the heat.
Serve warm in a bowl, with either toasted or fried
crusty rice squares. Garnished the dip with chopped
cilantro leaves and slices of medium hot red chili
peppers.

one of the front runners of the Conservative
leadership candidates, the winner who will be Canada's
next prime minister.)

large enough to hold fillets in a single layer. Cover
and bring liquid to just a simmer. Poach salmon about
2 minutes per side. Remove and keep warm. Reserve
stock for sauce.

Sauce: In a saucepan, bring shallots, stock, wine and
lemon juice to a boil. Cook till liquid is reduced by
half. Strain. Cut butter into small cubes. whisk into
mixture one piece at a time. Do not let boil. Season

Kingly Smoked Salmon

grill, seafood

1  pacific king salmon*
1  alder wood for smoking
      ----RUB----
1/4 cup dill, dried
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
      ----MOP (OPTIONAL----
1  remaining rub
1 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup oil (canola or corn)

*butterflied tail section; or use coho or silver salmon

1. The night before you plan to barbecue, combine the
rub ingredients in a small bowl. Open the salmon flat
and massage it well with about 2/3 of the rub,
reserving the rest of the mixture. Fold the salmon
back into its original shape, place it in a plastic
bag, and refrigerate it overnight.

2. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the
temperature to 180' to 200' F.

3. Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and let it
sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

4. If you plan to baste the fish, stir the remaining
rub together with the other mop ingredients in a small
saucepan and warm the mixture over low heat.

5. Transfer the salmon to the smoker skin side down,
placing the fish as far from the fire as possible.
Cook for 50 to 60 minutes, mopping it after 10 and 30
minutes in a wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for
your style of smoker. The salmon should flake easily
when done. Have a large spatula and a platter ready
when taking the salmon off the smoker, because it can
fall apart easily. Serve hot or chilled.

BBQ Tips: Alder remains the best wood for smoking
Pacific salmon. Alder chips are fairly common across
the country, but you may have more difficulty finding
the wood in chunks or logs. Fruit woods are the best
substitute, particularly when mixed with smaller
pieces of alder.

Klipfish (Klipfisk)

danish, seafood

1  text only

Now watch this sleight of culinary hand as I
effortlessly slip across national boundaries and
across hemispheres to inextricably link the cuisines
of Denmark and Mexico.

Klipfish is salted dried cod, and Danish klipfish is
so good that large quantities of it are exported to
Spain, where "bacalao", as it is called there, is much
appreciated.

Cut 2 lbs. of fish in pieces and soak for 24 hours in
lukewarm water (or milk, if desired) with a teaspoon
of soda.  Take up the fish, cut off the fins, and
scrape the skin.  Put over the fire in cold water
without salt and cook for half an hour until quite
tender.

Serve on a hot platter garnished with parsley and with
boiled potatoes, melted butter, mustard sauce and a
dish of diced, hard boiled eggs (figure one egg per
person).

Kruang Kaeng Khew Wan (Green Curry Paste)

condiments, seafood, thai

4 large fresh green chillies or
8 small fresh green chillies
1/2 cup purple shallots or
1 medium onion, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1/2 cup chopped fresh coriander (cilantro/c; hinese parsley)
1  including roots, stems. and leaves
1/4 cup finely sliced lemon grass or
1 medium the thinly slice rind of 1 medium l; emon
1 tablespoon chopped galangal, fresh or frozen
2 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon dried shrimp paste
2 tablespoon vegetable oil

Yield: 1 Cup (8 Fluid Ounces)

Don't let the colour fool you, a green curry can be
devastatingly hot if prepared the traditional way. For
less heat, discard the chilli seeds.

Remove the stems and roughly chop the chillies.  Put
into an electric blender with all of the other
ingredients and blend to a smooth paste. Add a Tbls of
extra oil or a little water, if necessary, to
facilitate blending and store as you would the red
curry paste.

Kung Op Wun Sen (Baked Prawns & Mungbean No

seafood, thai

1 lb prawns
5  coriander roots, crushed
1 tablespoon pepper corns
1  onion, thinly sliced
3 slice ginger, crushed
2 tablespoon cooking oil
1 tablespoon maggi sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
2 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon whiskey
2 cup mungbean noodles, soaked and cut in; to short lengths

Here's a goody that came out of my new Thai cookbook.
It's easy and quick to do and quite tasty.  It's a
baked dish, which is unusual for Thai cooking.  I
suspect that originally, it would have been steamed.
Next time I'll try it that way or put a tablespoon of
water or sherry in each bowl. It seemed a tad dry to
me.  I cooked it in individual French onion soup bowls
with lids.

Place the oil in a wok, heat and stir fry the
coriander root, ginger, pepper and onion.  When
fragrant, remove from the wok and place in a mixing
bowl.

Add the noodles, the sauces. salt, sugar, sesame oil
and whiskey, toss the noodles until well coated, and
then add the prawns and toss well once again.

Divide the noodles and prawns into four individual
portions; place each portion in a lidded cup, and
close the lids.  Place the cups on a baking tray and
bake at 460F until the prawns are done (about 10
minutes).

Serve hot with fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes and
spring onions. Serves four.

From "The Elegant Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine"
by Sisamon Kongpan and Pinyo Srisawat.  SLG Books,
Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989. ISBN 0-943389-05-4.

If you can buy coriander bunches with the roots
untrimmed you'll be in good shape.  If not, substitute
stems.  I left it out as the person I was eating with
doesn't like coriander at all.  It doesn't say to, but
I cracked the peppercorns slightly before adding them
to the mix.  By light soy sauce, they mean like in
thin soy, rather than as in "lite" soy sauce.

Maggi Sauce is a condiment sauce++originating in
France, I believe++ popular in Asia.  It's somewhat
like a slightly thick soy sauce.  It can be found in
the gourmet sections of supermarkets as well as in
Asian markets. If I didn't have any, I'd use thick
Chinese soy in it's place. If you can find the Maggi
Sauce grab it.  It lasts virtually forever in the
fridge. Get a small bottle, though.  I run across very
few recipes that call for it.  It's used as a table
condiment in Asia and is often seen on the tables at
Vietnamese restaurants here in the States.

The mungbean noodles are the thin, clear "cellophane"
noodles.  I'd have no qualms about using the similar
thin rice noodles if I couldn't find mungbean ones.

I picked up a neato garnish from the photo with this
dish.  It shows a green onion "brush" with a slice of
red pepper around the middle. Quite attractive and
easy to make.  Cut a slice of scallion++the whitish
part++about an inch and a half long.  Slice a fresh
red chili into quarter-inch slices.  Take a length of
scallion and push the seeds and pulp out of the chili
slice.  Slip the rind down to the middle of the piece
of scallion, then cut the exposed pieces of scallion
with a thin, sharp blade all the way through.  Make
two cuts vertically, then rotate the scallion and make
two more cuts.  Do both ends, then toss the bundle
into a bowl of water with lots of ice cubes and the
slit ends will curl up making a nice, tassley looking
garnish that's great to eat too.  The trick is to get
chilies that are about the same diameter as the
scallions so it's a snug fit. Just toss a couple of
the chilly, frilly scallions into each bowl before
serving.  It's a little touch, but it adds a lot to
the appearance of the dish.

4 lb salmon
1  lime
2  onions, sliced
1/2 cup butter
1  salt
1  pepper

Throughly clean and wash the salmon. Place salmon on heavy-duty
aluminum foil. Stuff salmon with the sliced onions, butter, salt and
pepper. Also smear butter on the outside of the salmon plus squeeze
the lime juice over as well. DO NOT REMOVE THE SKIN OF THE SALMON.
Sprinkle with more salt and pepper. Wrap the salmon tightly in the
foil so as to make as "air-tight" as possible...usually two layers of
foil. Place on the hot Bbq for 25 - 30 minutes then turn over and
bake the otherside for 15 minutes. Remove from Bbq and serve with
"new" mint potatoes and fresh peas. This is absolutely delicious!

Laverbread & Crab Souffles With Cockle Sauc

sauces, seafood

      ----THE SOUFFLES----
1  boiled crab; -or- prepared crabmeat
6 oz prepared laverbread or- nori or spi; nach
2 oz butter
2 oz flour
3/4 pint milk
3  eggs
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1  salt & pepper
      ----COCKLE SAUCE----
1/4 pint white sauce from souffle mix
1/4 pint whipping cream
4 oz cockles or clams (shelled)
2 oz prepared laverbread **

If the crab is whole, pull the body apart and pick out all the meat -
discarding only the mouthpiece and the grey "dead man's fingers" that
fringe the inside carapace. For extra flavour, make a stock with crab
shell, flavoured with a piece of carrot and a quarter of onion, and
boil down to a couple of well-flavoured tablespoons which can replace
the equivalent milk in the basic white sauce given above.

Prepare the white sauce; melt the butter in a small pan. Stir in the
flour and fry gently until the mixture is still pale but sandy. Whisk
in the milk slowly, beating till you have a thick sauce.  Simmer for
5 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6. Stir the
crabmeat and prepared laverbread into the sauce. Season with salt,
pepper and nutmeg. Separate the eggs.  Beat the whites until quite
stiff. By now the sauce will be cool enough to stir in the yolks.
Fold in the whites, turning well to "tire" the mixture.  Taste and
adjust the seasoning. Butter eight small souffle dishes and spoon in
the mixture, leaving a finger's worth for expansion. Bake for 10-12
minutes until puffed up and golden.

Meanwhile make the cockle sauce.  Heat up the reserved white sauce
with the cream.  Stir in the cockles and laverbread. Season with the
salt and freshly milled pepper. Serve with the souffles as soon as
they are ready.

Lazy Salmon Cakes

fish

1/2 cup mashed potato, 1 medium
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon lemon or orange peel dry
1/2 teaspoon dry dill or 1/4 c fresh dill
1/2 teaspoon dry cilantro /fresh parsley
1/4 medium onion, chopped
7 1/2 oz can salmon, no skin, bones
1  egg

Re "Lazy" - this was based on a recipe posted by Michelle Bass,
Cooking Echo, Sept 17/93.  I was too lazy to bake the potato, beat
the egg white or make the sauce.

Mash potato and allow it to cool.  Mix with lemon juice, seasonings,
onion and then mix in the salmon. Mix in beaten egg.

Form the mixture into 4 patties or 6 smaller ones. Heat a large saute
pan over medium heat.  Spray or wipe with canola. Fry the cakes for 5
minutes on each side until golden brown. Serve with lemon wedge.

Makes 2 servings for hungry eaters, 3 smaller ones.

Le Trou's Mouclade

french, seafood

3 quart mussels, cleaned
6 tablespoon unsalted butter (75g)
6  shallots, chopped fine
1  bouquet garni (celery, bay leaf, th; yme, parsley stems)
1 cup white wine (240ml)
1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
1 cup heavy cream (240ml)
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
1  clove garlic, mashed

This one is almost enough to get me off my duff and over to the coast
to gather some mussels.

Robert Reynolds, chef/owner of Le Trou Restaurant Francais in San
Francisco provides this recipe.  He has used it as a vehicle for
teaching his students about saffron's special qualities. This recipe
originated in the French Bordeaux region.

Steep threads in wine for 30 minutes.  Saute 6 shallots in butter
until limp.  Add Bouquet garni and wine. Simmer for 1 minute. Add
cleaned mussels, cover pan with tight-fitting lid, and steam mussels
open, shaking pan occasionally.  Check after 3 minutes. Remove opened
mussels and set in colander over a bowl to catch their juices.
Discard any mussels not opened after 6 minutes.  Saute remaining
shallots in butter until limp. Add mussel juice and cream and reduce
to desired consistency. Add parsley and garlic, then toss mussels in
sauce until well coated. Serve in soup bowls.

Legal's Inaugral Fish Chowder

fish, soups

1/2 cup butter
3 cup diced onions
1/4 cup finely grated carrots
2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 cup flour
12 cup concentrated fish stock
4 lb chowder fish fillets, such as 2 lbs; . cod, 1 lb. monkfish and
1 lb cusk (note from al: i believe any f; irm white fish will do)
2 cup light cream
1/2 cup finely grated monterey jack cheese

salt freshly ground black pepper

Heat the butter in a large saucepan until softened, and saute the
onions, carrots and garlic in it, stirring frequently, for about 5
minutes. Remove from heat and slowly stir in the flour. Return to the
heat, and cook, stirring, for about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, begin
heating the stock in a large pot. Whisk the stock into the flour
mixture. Bring the stock to a boil, whisking constantly, then reduce
the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.

Add the fish and simmer about 10 minutes longer.  Stir in the cream
and cheese, and simmer until the cheese melts, about 5 to 8 minutes.
(You won't distinguish the cheese as such, it is incorporated in the
chowder.) Reheat the chowder slowly so the cream doesn't boil.

Makes about 3 quarts.

Lemon-Roasted Salmon With Creamy Dill Sauce

fish, fish/shell, main dish, shellfish

5 lb salmon, cleaned [1 fish]
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3  lemons, sliced
1/2 cup fresh dill
1/2 cup fresh parsley sprigs
2 tablespoon butter, melted
      ----CREAMY DILL WINE SAUCE----
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup whipping cream
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped

Buying Tip: When buying fresh fish, flesh should be firm, spring back
when touched and smell fresh. Fish should have unclouded eyes and
bright red gills. To determine thickness of fish, use a ruler, placed
perpendicular to the backbone, and a flat edge across the side of the
fish, at right angle to the ruler. Read ruler where the two intersect.

1. Let salmon stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Using sharp
chef's knife, firmly cut off fish head behind gills (or have
fishmonger remove it). Rinse under cold water; pat dry. Season inside
and out with salt and pepper. Line baking sheet with foil; arrange
one-third of the lemon slices in lengthwise row along centre. Top
with salmon.

2. Fill body cavity with dill, parsley and another third of the
lemons. Brush butter over salmon; top with remaining lemons. Measure
thickest part of salmon; calculate 12-15 minutes cooking time for
every 1 inch of thickness. Crumple up foil around fish to hold
juices, leaving salmon uncovered.

3. Bake salmon in 450F 230C oven for about 45 minutes or until flesh
at thickest part is opaque and flakes easily when tested with fork.
Remove from oven and tent with foil; let stand for 5 minutes. With
baster or spoon, remove 1/4 cup pan juices; set aside.

4. Creamy Dill Wine Sauce: In saucepan, melt butter over medium heat;
stir in flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in
milk, wine, cream, salt and pepper; cook, whisking, for 5 minutes or
until boiling and thickened. Stir in reserved pan juices; reduce heat
and simmer for 5 minutes. Keep warm over low heat while carving
salmon; stir in dill.

5. to serve salmon, discard lemon on top. cut lengthwise along
backbone through to bone. Starting at backbone, gently pull off skin;
discard. Cut along midline (This is the natural fold between the back
flesh and the flesh on the rib bones.) parallel to backbone, through
to bone. Cut crosswise into 4-inch wide portions. Insert spatula
between meat and bones, lift salmon portions to warmed serving plates.

6. Gently lift exposed bones away from the other side of salmon;
discard. Repeat cutting along midline as in Step 5, then into
portions; ease salmon away from skin. Serve with warm sauce.

Lime-Ginger Smoked Salmon

bbq, diabetic, low-fat/cal, seafood, smoker

3 lb whole salmon
1  lime; juiced
1 tablespoon grated lime peel
1 tablespoon fresh ginger and
1 teaspoon powdered ginger
3  handfuls dried apple or
1  maple twigs
12 oz apple juice
1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger or
3 slice fresh ginger
3 cup cooked brown rice or
1  couscous

Clean salmon; discard head.  Peel ginger and slice very thin. Wash
and pat salmon dry.  Rub salmon with lime juice. Put ginger slices
and lime peel inside cavity of fish. Sprinkle powdered ginger over
exterior of fish. cover fish lightly with plastic wrap and
refrigerate 2 hours.
Soak twigs 30 in water 30 minutes; drain.
Prepare smoker according to manufacturer's directions. Fill fire pan
about three-quarters full of hardwood charcoal and heat coals. Arrange
twigs over hot coals. Fill water pan about three-quarters full with
hot water.  Add apple juice and ginger to water pan and place pan in
smoker as aromatic.
Unwrap salmon and place on sprayed grid.  cover quickly. smoke
salmon about 3 hours or until fish flakes easily when prodded with
fork. Skin will turn a smoky color.
While smoking, remember not to remove lid of smoker more than is
necessary because it allows heat and moisture to escape, which slows
the smoking process. also, while using smoker, check every 30 minutes
to see if hot water or coals have to be replenished. Be careful and
use pot holders.
Serve fish warm or cold with hot rice.

NOTE:  A perfect way to store fresh ginger is to peel it, place it in
a small jar, cover it with sherry, and refrigerate. The sherry adds
flavor and body to the taste of the ginger.

2 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 tablespoon olive oil
1  sm onion; finely chopped
3 cup garlic; minced or pressed
1/2 cup dry white wine
1  salt and pepper
1/2 cup parsley; chopped fresh

Place clams and 1/4 cup water in a large heavy pan. Cover and simmer
just until clams pop open (5 to 10 minutes). When cool enough to
handle, remove clams from shells and set aside (save a few clams in
shells for garnish, if you wish). Strain clam broth through a piece
of dampened muslin to remove grit; reserve broth. Cook linguine in a
large kettle of boiling salted water according to package directions
until al dente; drain well. While linguine cooks, place butter and
oil in a wide frying pan over medium heat. When butter is melted, add
onion and cook, stirring often, until soft. Mix in garlic, wine, and
strained clam broth. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook
until liquid is reduced by about half. Add clams, season with salt
and pepper to taste, and stir in parsley. Arrange linguine on a warm
serving platter. Spoon hot sauce over linguine. Garnish with reserved
clams in shells, if you wish.

Linguine With Tarragon & Clam Sauce

italian, pasta, sauces, seafood

1  recipe egg pasta (or 3/4 lb dry lin; guine)
2  cloves garlic
2 tablespoon fresh tarragon, chopped (2 tsp drie; d)
30  steamers or other small clams (abou; t 2 lbs)
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup olive oil
1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
1  salt
1  pepper

PREPARATION:  Make the Egg Pasta.  Roll as thin as possible and cut
into 1/8-inch wide strips for linguine. Mince the garlic. Chop the
tarragon. Scrub the clams, discarding any that have opened. Place
clams and wine in a large pot; cook, covered, over medium-high heat,
shaking occasionally, until all the clams have opened, about 6
minutes. Remove pot from heat and allow clams to cool.  Remove clams
from shells; if using steamers, pull off the black portion of the
neck. Swish clams in the cooking liquid to remove any loose sand.
Strain cooking liquid through cheesecloth or a coffee filter.  Chop
clams and put them in a bowl with the strained cooking liquid.  Add 1
tablespoon of the olive oil. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of the
olive oil over low heat in a small saucepan. Add the garlic and cook
until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the tarragon and red-pepper flakes
and cook for 2 minutes more. Add the clams and cooking liquid, bring
to a simmer, and remove saucepan from the heat. Season with salt and
pepper.  NOTE:  Recipe can be made to this point several hours ahead.

COOKING AND SERVING:  Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water until
tender, about 3 minutes for fresh pasta. Meanwhile, reheat the clam
sauce if made ahead.  Drain the pasta and return to the pot.  Toss
linguine with the clam sauce and adjust the seasoning, if desired.
Serve immediately.

Makes 4 servings.

Linguini With Seafood - Buon'appetito

italian, main dish, pasta, seafood

2 tablespoon olive oil
3  shallots chopped  or green onions
1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
1/2 teaspoon red chili pepper flakes
2 tablespoon parsley, chopped
12 large shrimp or prawns
12  scallops
1/2 cup white wine
2 lb mussels
28 oz tomatoes, canned
1/4 cup basil, fresh, shredded
1 lb linquini

Serve pasta and sauce in a large bowl on the table and let people help
themselves. Vary the seafood according to your tastes. If you prefer a
vegetarian version, saute mushrooms and peppers instead of seafood
and add into tomato sauce. Grated parmesan is traditionally not
offered with seafood dishes. 1. In a large skillet, heat olive oil on
medium-high heat. Add shallots and garlic. Saute for 1 minute or
until softened slightly, then add lemon rind, parsley, shrimps and
scallops. Saute together until shrimps just turn pink and scallops
are translucent, about 1-2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon from
skillet. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Add white wine to skillet,
bring to boil and add mussels. Cover and steam mussels until they
open, about 3 minutes. Remove mussels from skillet and reserve with
shrimps and scallops. Discard any mussels that do not open. Remove
mussel meats from half the mussels, leaving remainder in their
shells. 3. Meanwhile drain tomatoes and chop, reserving juice. Add
tomatoes, juice and chili flakes into skillet and bring to boil. Stir
in 2TB basil and simmer for 10 minutes to combine flavours. Season
with salt and pepper. Sauce can be made ahead to this point. 4. When
ready to serve: bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta
and cook until al dente, about 10-12 minutes. Drain well. 5. Return
seafood to sauce, sprinkle with remaining basil then reheat. Toss
with pasta and serve.

Little Parcels Of Trout

fish

3  trout (8-9 oz ea cleaned wt)
1/2 lb courgettes
1/2 lb carrots
1/4 lb mangetout peas
2 1/2 oz butter
1/2  lemon
1  fresh mint & chives

Cut the courgettes and carrots into matchstick shapes about 1 1/2
inch long and less than 1/4 inch wide. Steam them, and the mangetout,
but only briefly, not enough to tenderise them fully. Use kitchen
paper to blot surface moisture from the partially cooked vegetables
and set aside ot become cold. Season the softened butter with sea
salt and black pepper. Beat in 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice and 1
tablespoon or so each chopped chives and mint. Use some of the
flavoured butter to grease sheets of greaseproof or bakewell paper.
Clean and fillet the trout, remove any little bones and cut the flesh
of each fish into four long strips. Lay three strips side by side
down the centre of each sheet of buttered greaseproof paper. Dust
with sea salt and grind some pepper over the fish. Add a squeeze of
lemon butter.  Lay the mixed vegetables on top, spreading them thinly
and seasoning with salt and pepper between layers. Dot with the rest
of the butter and, finely, add a sprig or two of mint to each parcel.
To close the parcels, first draw two sides of the paper up over the
filling and fold into a double pleat on top.  Then "hem" the raw
paper edges at the sides by turning them over twice, and secure with
staples. The parcels should be fairly baggy. Put each parcel on to an
oeuf sur le plat dish or space them out in large gratin dishes or on
baking trays. Chill until about 1 1/2 hours before cooking, then
bring back to room temperature. To cook, bake at 400 F (200 C) gas
mark 6 for about 15 minutes. Let each person unwrap his or her parcel
at table. Hand round bowls of new potatoes steamed in their skins,
plain undressed watercress, and Hollandaise sauce so that everyone
can help themselves.

Lj's New Zealand Salmon In Jelly

fish, main dish

6 lb fresh salmon
6 tablespoon butter
3  lemons
1  salt
1  pepper

Clean salmon and remove head, tail and fins. Cut the salmon into 1 lb
steaks (not fillets). Place 1 salmon steak onto a sheet of foil,
squeeze the juice of 1/2 a lemon, spread 1 tb of butter plus salt and
pepper on the salmon. Wrap the salmon steak tightly in the foil
(heavy duty) so as to make the best water tight seal as possible.
Repeat for each steak. Boil the packages in water for 20 minutes.
Remove and place in the freezer for an hour then refrigerate for 2
hours. When ready to serve, unwrap the salmon steaks carefully on a
large platter and cover with warm Hollandaise Sauce. To accompany the
salmon, this dish should be served with new baby potatoes which have
been boiled with mint leaves, and fresh garden peas, plus a palatable
white wine. This is a very basic but absolutely delicious recipe. Of
course, the fun is catching the salmon and telling the story of how
the large one snapped the rod like a pretzel and "got away"!

Lobster In Tomato Sauce With Saffron Rice

seafood

2  lobsters (about 2 lbs each)  (live,; or recently dead)
25  saffron strands; soaked in
1/4 cup hot water
1/4 lb finely chopped onion
1 medium leek; washed, finely chopped
8 tablespoon fruity olive oil
3  garlic cloves; minced
1 lb tomatoes; skinned, seeded,  and fin
4  sun-dried tomatoes (in oil)  pounde; d to a paste
1/2 cup white wine
1/4 cup orange juice
1  bay leaf
1  salt & freshly ground pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped fennel
1/2 cup minced flat-leaf parsley
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint
1  saffron rice

If you have live lobsters, plunge them into a pan of boiling water
for 1 minute, then into cold water.

To prepare the lobsters, break off the claws and crack them open with
a hammer.  Cut off the tip of the tail (with the fins), then sever
the tail where it joins the head with a heavy knife. Cut the tail
into rings, slicing through the shell between the ribs.

Split the head open lengthwise with a hard blow of a knife and remove
and discard the gritty stomach sac. Pour the coral (if any) and the
green matter (which is the liver) into a stainer over a bowl,
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and reserve.  Put the saffron to soak.

In a heavy-bottomed pan big-enough to contain the lobsters and sauce,
fry the onion and leek gently in 3 tablespoons olive oil until
translucent. Add the garlic, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and
liquid, wine, orange juice, and bay leaf.  Season and simmer,
covered, for 15 minutes.

Add the fennel, parsley, mint, saffron and liquid, and lobster tail
pieces and claws with their shells (but not the legs) and simmer,
covered, for 10 minutes.

In the meantime push the coral and liver of the lobster through the
strainer and beat the purie with the remaining olive oil. When the
lobster has simmered for 10 minutes, ladle out about 1 cup sauce and
beat this into the coral purie.  Pour this back into the pot, stir,
and simmer for another 10 minutes. Serve with saffron rice.

Lobster Puerto Nuevo

mexican, shellfish

2 small lobsters
1  garlic salt
1  pepper
1/2 lb lard -- for frying
2 quart boiling water -- for
1  steaming

~ Cut each lobster (about 1-1/2 pounds each) in half lengthwise and
clean/devein. - Sprinkle with plenty of garlic salt and pepper on the
meat. - IF FRYING - Heat lard in frying pan. When hot, add 2 lobster
halves at a time. - IF STEAMING - Bring water to boil in large
spathetti pot. Place in large strainer inside and add lobster. Cover
pan and cook 4 to 5 minutes or until meat is white and fork
penetrates it easily.

Chef: "Apply garlic salt and pepper generously on the lobster after
you slice it in half and fry the lobster in lard for a couple of
minutes. That's it. That's my big secret." Actually, Iraola, like
most of the chefs and cooks in Puerto Nuevo, depends heavily on lard
(not oil)... uses it for everything, even the rice. However, those
who will notor cannot venture into this artery-clogging cuisine, can
try *langosta al vapor* or steamed lobster, with what they call here
the honeymooner's salad, "lettuce alone," with a little Italian
dressing on the side.

Lobster Tart

seafood

      ----THE PASTRY----
8 oz flour
3 oz cold lard
3 oz cold butter
3 tablespoon ice-cold water (or more)
      ----THE FILLING----
1  live lobster *
5  eggs **
1/2 pint milk
1/2 pint single cream

*Note: the lobster should be good and lively.  A "cripple" - that is,
one with only one claw for which you should pay less - will do fine
for this dish. ** Leave out one of the egg whites, it is not needed
for this recipe.

Make the pastry first.  Sieve the flour with the salt into a roomy
bowl. Chop the lard and butter into the flour with a sharp knife.
Finish rubbing in the fat to flour with the tips of your fingers.
Work in enough ice-cold water to give you a ball of soft (but not
sticky) dough. Cover with cling-film and leave the dough to rest in a
cool place for half an hour or so.  Bring a panful of salted water to
the boil - enough to swim the lobster.  Kill the lobster (or have you
fishmonger do so) with a knife slipped in behind its head. Or plunge
the creature in the boiling water and hold it under with a wooden
spoon (lobsters do drown).

Cook the lobster for 3-4 minutes - just long enough to turn the shell
scarlet and make the lobster easier to skin. Drain it, sever the head
and cut in half, taking care to save the greenish black brain (rather
like liquid seaweed).  This will turn anything into which it is
stirred wonderful sunny scarlet as it cooks. Reserve the brain for
making lobster butter. Otherwise it can go into the tart filling.

Remove the lobster meat from the body, claws and head (leave out the
dark intestine which runs right down the body - and the stomach at
the top of the head). Slice the body meat into medallions. Leave the
claw meat whole.

Bake the tart-case blind (lined with foil weighted with dried beans
instead of filling) in a medium oven, 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5, for
10 minutes.

Beat the milk, cream and eggs together and season. Pour the mixture
into the cooled tart tin.  Arrange the lobster pieces over all. Bake
at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, until the egg-filling is
set.

Lobster~ Normandy Style (Homard A La Normande

french, seafood

4  fresh lobsters, live
1/2 cup sweet butter
1  salt
1  freshly ground white pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped shallots or scallion; s
12 cup calvados
3 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoon all purpose flour
1/2  lemon, juice of
1 dash cayenne pepper
2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley

Servings: 4

Split the lobsters lengthwise with a big knife and break the shells
off the claws with a hammer or a cleaver. Pour the liquid and the
tomalley (the liver) into a small bowl. Discard the stomach (the
small sac which is behind the eyes).

Melt half the butter in a large, heavy saucepan. When the butter
turns the color of a hazelnut, add the lobsters and sprinkle with
salt and pepper. Cook over high heat for eight to 10 minutes, turning
lobsters often. They should turn evenly red all over. Remove the
lobsters from the saucepan. Arrange in a large roasting pan and place
in a preheated 250-F oven to keep them warm and to finish cooking.

Add the shallots to the saucepan and sizzle exactly 1 minute without
burning. Add the Calvados, ignite, and when the flame dies out, add
the cream. Work together the remaining butter and the flour. When the
sauce starts boiling, add the flour mixture (beurre manie), bit by
bit, whipping vigorously into the sauce with a wire whisk until
smooth. Bring slowly to a boil. Then mix in the tomalley and lemon
juice. Taste for seasoning and add salt and cayenne pepper, if
necessary. You may cook a bit longer to reduce the sauce if you like
it thicker. Stir in the parsley. Pour the sauce over the lobsters and
serve piping hot.

A rice pilaf is usually served with this dish, and we would recommend
a chilled white Traminer wine or a bottle of old cider.

Lomi Lomi Salmon

seafood

1 lb salt salmon
5  large ripe tomatoes
1  medium yellow onion; chopped
8  green onions

I usually scoop the tomato insides out with a large melon baller
attempting to keep the outside shell of the tomato as intact as
possible. Dice the removed insides and place the diced tomatoes and
their shells in the refrigerator while proceeding with the recipe.
Soak the salt salmon after cleaning. Change the soaking water
occasionally to drain off most of the salt. After 3 to 5 hours of
soaking remove all of the skin and the bones. Cut the salmon into
small pieces and placed in a bowl. Add the diced tomatoes and also
add the yellow onion which has been chopped into fairly small pieces.
Cover the mixture with ice cubes until ready to serve. Chop the green
onions very small and place them on top of the tomato mixture that
you will place in the tomato shells to serve. Just as you serve the
shells add a little crushed ice. FROM: THEODORE SEDGWICK (XPST31A)

Lone John Sliver

fish

2 1/2 lb fish fillets
1  oil
1/2 cup beer
1/2 cup self-rising flour
      ----THE BATTER----
2/3 cup beer
1/3 cup lemon juice
1  egg
1/2 cup bisquick
1/2 cup self-rising flour

THE BATTER: In a 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl, with wire whisk, whip 2/3
cup beer, lemon juice, egg, Bisquick, and 1/2 cup self-rising flour
together till smooth. Then let it stand ten minutes at room
temperature before using.  Meanwhile place two soup or cereal bowls
on counter near the stove so that you can work quickly in coating
food and getting it into the hot oil.

In one small bowl put 1/2 cup beer and into the other put 1/2 cup
self-rising flour.  Have a cookie sheet on hand. Cover half of it with
paper towels for draining the fried foods. The other half leave plain
for drying the coated food before you dip it into batter.

Allow 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 lbs. fish fillets to serve 4 people. Cut each
fillet in half to resemble triangles. Dip 1 piece at a time, first
into beer. Let excess drip off. Coat lightly then in the self-rising
flour.

Place floured pieces on cookie sheet to dry 2 or 3 minutes. Then spear
piece with 3-tined fork or tip of sharp knife & coat in prepared
batter...evenly but lightly, letting excess drip back into bowl of
batter.

Fry few pieces at a time in 385 to 400 degrees F oil, at least 2 1/2"
to 3" deep in heavy saucepan or use electric fry pan with temperature
control dial to regulate heat of oil.

Allow about 3 or 4 minutes per side for each piece of batter-coated
fish, turning once to brown other side. Remove from oil with tip of
sharp knife. Drain on paper towel. Keep warm on cookie sheet in 300
degree F oven till all pieces have been fried.

SHRIMP-DEEP FRIED: Substitute large or jumbo shrimp preferably frozen,
cooked, ready to serve shrimp, that have been completely thawed,
following the Lone John Sliver recipe exactly, using the shrimp in
place of the fish triangles.  Be sure to dip the shrimp 1st in the
beer and then into the self-rising flour before coating in prepared
batter. Fry as directed for fish in above recipe. 1 pound serves 4.

Long John Silver's Batter-Dipped Fish

fish, main dish

3 cup soybean oil
2 lb fresh cod fillets
1 1/3 cup self rising flour
1 cup water
1  egg
2 teaspoon granulated sugar
2 teaspoon salt

1) Heat oil in a deep pan to 375 F. 2) Cut fish into wedges approx.
7" x 2"(wide end) x 1 1/2" (narrow end) 3) With mixer, blend flour,
water, egg, sugar, and salt. 4) Dip each fillet into the batter,
coating generoursly, and quickly drop into the oil. 5) Fry each
fillet until dark golden brown, about 5 min. 6) Remove from oil and
place on paper towels or metal rack to drain.

Yeild: 4 to 6 fish fillets

Soybean oil is what your local Long John Silver's uses to fry their
fish, and you will best duplicate the real thing by using the same
oil. But any other oil may be substituted. You might want to try
canola oil. It is the oil lowest in saturated fat, and the taste
difference is only slight.
It's crucial that your oil be hot before frying the fish. To
test the temp., drip some batter into the oil. It should bubble
rapidly. After 5 min., the test batter should become golden brown. If
so, fry away, fish fiends.

sausage, cook ingredients longer to ensure they'll be done when rice
is done.) Add 2 more cups of water and bring to a boil.  Add
remaining ingredients, stir to blend, but not too much.  Reduce heat
to low, cover pot, and cook about 30 minutes or until rice is cooked.
Try not to open lid during final cooking. Fluff rice thoroughly with
fork before serving.

Lumpia (Philippine Egg Rolls From Scratch)

appetizers, filipino, fish

      ----DOILIES----
3 cup flour
5 cup ; water, less 2 tb.
1  salt; to taste
      ----FILLING----
3/4 lb ground pork or beef
5 oz raw shrimp; chopped
1 small onion; chopped
8 oz can water chestnuts; drained - finely chopped
4 oz can bamboo shoots; drained - finely chopped
1/2  stalk celery; fine chopped
3  garlic cloves; fine chopped
1 small carrot; finely chopped
1 lb can bean sprouts; drained
1/2 cup raisins; chopped
1  salt and pepper; to taste
1  egg white; lightly beaten
1  corn oil
      ----LUMPIA SAUCE----
2 cup pineapple juice
1 cup ketchup
1/2 teaspoon vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 dash hot pepper sauce
1/2  inch cube crushed ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Doilies:  Combine flour, water and salt to taste and mix thoroughly
with a wire whisk to remove lumps. Batter should be about the
consistency of a crepe batter. Add a little water if it is too thick.
If the batter thickens as it sits, you may have to add more water.
Heat a 6" crepe pan and wipe out with lightly oiled wax paper. Pour
on batter quickly to cover the bottom.  Pour off excess. Allow to
cook over low heat until the edges begin to curl and pull away from
the sides of the pan. Remove and place on clean, dry surface. Repeat,
oiling pan each time. Do not stack doilies on top of each other until
each has cooled. Before filling, put off excess batter to make a
perfect circle.

Filling:  Cook pork or beef in a large skillet until pinkness is gone.
Drain off grease.  Add shrimp, onions, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots,
celery, garlic and carrot; cook until carrot is almost tender. Stir in
remaining ingredients except the egg white and oil. Mix well. Cook
until bean sprouts are limp.

Pour mixture into strainer and cool, allowing as much liquid as
possible to drain off before filling rolls. Use about 1 heaping tsp.
for each doily. Place filling near one side. Roll doily over filling
a couple of times; fold in sides and roll up tightly.  Seal flap with
a little egg white.

Deep fry in corn oil heated to about 375 F., until rolls are golden.
Drain thoroughly on paper towels and serve with sauce.

Note: If rolls are filled ahead of time, cover and refrigerate until
it is time to serve.  Return to room temperature and fry.

Lumpia Sauce:  Combine all ingredients but the corn starch and heat.
Meanwhile, mix corn starch with enough of the pineapple juice mixture
to make a smooth paste. Return cornstarch mixture to pot and simmer
until mixture is thick.  Makes about 3 cups.

Lutfisk

seafood

2 1/2 lb lutfisk
1 cup slaked lime
2 quart oak or maple ashes
      ----MUSTARD SAUCE----
2 tablespoon butter
1 dash of pepper
3 tablespoon flour
3 cup fish stock
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon prepared mustard

Found a real gem of Americana last weekend.  It's a cookbook of Grange
recipes.  For those from other parts of the world (and big US
cities), a grange is an association of farmers++they were big in the
past in the US. This is American heartland cooking++long an canned
stuff and casseroles. The seafood section was understandably
short++two pages in a book of some 300 odd pages. But a couple of the
entries caught my eye. This one for Lutefisk looks particularly
interesting. Any recipe that calls for sawing one of the main
ingredients naturally catches my eye.

Now, I've never had Lutefisk in spite of being half Swedish. Both
sides of my family were busy becoming Americans and none of the
ethnic delicacies made it down to us third generation kids. Being a
full- fledged, All-American boy, I naturally resent being deprived of
my roots and am eager to sue someone for the grievous affront of
never having had lutefisk when I was growing up. Can't for the life
of me figure out who to sue though...

Traditional on Christmas Eve.  (Dried Imported Cod)

Saw fish into 3 parts, clean thoroughly and place in a wooden bowl or
pail. Add water to cover and set in a cool place for 5 to 6 days.
Change water each day. Remove fish and thoroughly clean wooden bowl.
Make a solution of water, lime and ashes and allow to stand
overnight. Drain off clear liquid and pour over soaked fish, set in a
cool place for 7 days. When fish is soft, remove from solution, scrub
bowl well and soak fish for several days in cold clear water.  Cook
in boiling salted water at simmering temperature for about 20
minutes. Drain well and serve. The Norwegians serve the fish with
melted butter; the Swedes serve it with white or mustard sauce. Allow
1/3 pound per person.

MUSTARD SAUCE:

Melt 1 1/2 T. butter, blend in flour, salt and pepper, add fish stock
gradually, stirring constantly until thickened then cook for an
additional 3 minutes.  Add mustard and remaining butter. Serve with
boiled lutfisk, haddock or cod.

Makes 2 1/2 cups sauce.

NOTE:  If fish stock is salty do not add salt listed.

8 oz cheese, shredded
1/4 cup oil
1 tablespoon butter
3 cup bread cubes
1 cup cream, heavy
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, ground
1 pint oysters, with liquor
1/4 cup parsley, chopped

M&M/Mars 3 Musketeers

candy, dressings, seafood

3 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
3/4 cup water
1/8 teaspoon salt
3  egg whites
1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2  bags milk chocolate chips
1  (12-ounce bags)

1.  In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, corn
syrup, water, adn salt.  Heat, stirring, to boiling, then continue to
cook, using a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. 2. Beat
the egg whites until they are stiff and form peaks.  Don't use a
plastic bowl for this. 3. When the sugar solution comes to 270
degrees F, or the soft-crack stage, remove from the heat and pour the
mixture in thin streams into the egg whites, blending completely with
a mixer set on low speed. 4. Continue to mix until the candy begins
to harden to the consistency of dough. This may take as long as 20
minutes.  At this point, add the semisweet chocolate chips.  Remember
that the candy must already be at the consistency of dough when you
add the chocolate;  the nougat will thicken no more after the
chocolate is added. 5.  When the chocolate is thoroughly blended and
the nougat has thickened, press it into a greased 9x9-inch pan.
Refrigerate until firm, about 30  minutes. 6. With a sharp knife, cut
the candy in half down the middle of the pan. Then cut across into 7
segments to create a total of 14 bars. 7.  Melt the milk chocolate
chips in the microwave for 2 minutes on half  power, stirring halfway
through the heatingtime. Melt completely, but be careful not to
overheat. 8. Resting a bar on a fork (and using your fingers if
needed), dip each  bar into the chocolate to coat completely and
place on wax paper. Cool till firm at room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.
Makes 14 candy bars.

Mackerel In Vinegar

fish

1  mackerel
1  butter or oil
1  large onion
1  sugar
1  salt and pepper
1  malt vinegar

Fillet the mackerel, then dry with a cloth.  Roll the fillets in
flour and fry until golden brown, cool.

Place one layer of fillets in a bowl and sprinkle liberally with salt
and sugar.  Place another layer of mackerel on top and again sprinkle
with salt and sugar. Continue until bowl is full or all fish are used.

Peel and slice a large onion.  Place the raw onion on top of the last
layer of fish.  Sprinkle liberally with pepper. Fill bowl with
vinegar, cover with a lid. Leave for two days then try the vinegar.
If it is not to taste, add more sugar.

Mackerel prepared like this will keep for a considerable time
although not as long as pickled fish.

Note.  If you are not used to buying mackerel, remember that they
MUST be bought fresh.  They do NOT keep well in shop premises.

stuffing on them.  Roll each up, put them in a greased oven dish and
cook them in a moderate oven (400F) for 15-20 minutes.
. While the fish are being cooked, make the rhubarb sauce by placing
all the ingredients listed in a saucepan and stewing tehm until the
rhubarb is cooked and quite soft. This will take 10 minutes or a
little longer. Then put the cooked rhubarb through a fine sieve or
the blender, to make a puree of it.  This can be served either hot or
cold with the cooked mackerel.

Magic Chicken

fruits, main dish, microwave, seafood

2 lb chicken parts; more or less
2 1/2 lb chicken parts; skinned
1 quart orange juice
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ginger
1/2 teaspoon cloves
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1  to
3  garlic cloves

Mix spices (except garlic) together and blend well. Rub in to chicken
pieces.

Arrange chicken pieces in microwaveable casserole and pour in orange
juice to cover.

Mince garlic and add to juice, add any remaining spice mixture.

Microwave 30 minutes at 70% power, turning pieces over halfway
through to ensure even heating.

People watching fat can pull the skin off the chicken (or use skinless
pieces in the first place); people eating fat can leave it on.

I like to take the cooked pieces and pop them under a broiler for a
couple of minutes on each side to brown them and crisp them up a bit.

The orange juice can be re-used for up to two subsequent batches,
though it is kind of ruined for serving at breakfast time.

Malaysian Fish With Pears

fish, main dish

1 lb pan-sized trout; or other white-fleshed fi
2  bartlett pears; peeled, seeded and quarte
2 tablespoon dry white wine
2 tablespoon light soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon chile-garlic paste
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
3  green onions; smashed and slivered
3  quarter-size pieces ginger; cut into matchstick piece
4  cloves garlic; peeled and minced
1 tablespoon lemon grass; minced
1/2 cup cilantro leaves; chopped
1/2  lime; in wedges
6 cup water

Place the fish and pears in a glass pie plate. Combine remaining
ingredients except cilantro, lime and water and stir to mix
thoroughly. Pour the mixture over the fish. In a wok, or deep pot,
bring water to a boil. Put the pie plate of fish on a steamer tray,
cover and steam the fish over the simmering water until it's flaky,
about 20 minutes.

Serve the fish and pears on a bed of rice napped with the sauce in the
bottom of the pie plate. Garnish with cilantro leaves and lime wedges.

The choices among fish varieties in Malaysia boggles the mind. In the
U.S. you can successfully repeat this dish using pan-sized trout,
grouper, or other tender fleshed fish.

Maltese Sauce  (Malteser Sosse)

fish, german, meats, sauces, vegetables

1/2  blood orange or reg. ogange
1  green onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon dry white wine
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
3 tablespoon chicken stock
2  egg yolks, slightly beaten
1/2 cup butter, cut in small pieces
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1  salt
1  white pepper
5 tablespoon fresh whipped cream *

* 3 to 5 tablespoons of REAL whipped cream...NO substitutes.

This sauce needs to be made with extra care. Cut peel from half the
orange, removing only the colored portion. Cut peel into fine narrow
strips. Blanch peel briefly in boiling water, if desired. Finely chop
peel, if desired; set aside. Juice orange; set aside. In a small
skillet, simmer green onion 5 minutes over low heat in wine, vinegar
and stock. Strain well, discarding green onion; cool slightly. Place
egg yolks and wine mixture in a small enamel-lined saucepan. Place
over hot water or use a double-boiler. Water should be barely
simmering at any time. If mixture is over heated it will curdle and
must be remade from new ingredients. Add butter, one piece at a time,
mixing well and making sure each piece is fully incorporated before
adding the next. If desired use a whisk to beat butter into yolk
mixture. When all butter has been added, sauce should be fairly thick
and creamy. Add lemon juice, salt, white pepper, balnched orange peel
and juice. Fold in whipped cream before serving. Serve immediately to
prevent sauce from seperating. This sauce is delicious with delicate
fish or vegetable dishes, such as asparagus. It is also very good
with broiled meat. Makes 4 servings.

Ma'oa & Pahua Tairo (Tahiti)

seafood, tahiti

2  dozen ma'oa [turbot snails] or pahu; a [clams]
500 gm taioro [juice of grated coconuts, s; eawater and shrimps]
3  onions
2  garlic cloves
1  salt and pepper

Here's an illustrative recipe from "Tahitian Cooking".

The turbot snails are available around here++in pet stores for
something like eight bucks a pop!  They might be available in a
Chinese seafood market for a reasonable price. I'll check the next
time I'm up that way.

The snail of the ma'oa may be extracted from the shell either by
breaking the shells with a hammer or by boiling them for a few
minutes if you wish to keep the shells intact. Wash the snails and
remove the pocket of black matter.  In the case of the pahua, a
bivalve, the muscle adhering to the shell should be severed, the
animal extracted from the shell, and the black matter removed.  Soak
in fresh water for a few hours. Mix with the taioro, then add the
chopped onions and garlic plus seasoning. Serve at room temperature.
[Note that there's no mention of actually cooking the stuff... S.C.]

1/4 teaspoon powdered bay leaf
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1  clove garlic; crushed
1  juice of 1 lemon

Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly. Pour the mixture over the
meat, chicken or fish to be marinated and allow to steep for 2 hrs.,
turning occasionally. Then grill meat, and,if desired,slice thin and
serve on garlic bread. Below is another recipe. Just a quickie, but
quite good. I don't have amounts for everything. Just use your
judgement accdng to how much meat you have. Soy sauce; a little red
wine (optional); a bunch of garlic powder, and onion powder. Marinate
at least one hour, turning once. >>> Grill and do same as with other
marinade to serve. These two recipes are the only way we will eat
steak. We are in cold climate in fall and winter, so we don't get to
grill all year, but if we could, we would!! E N J O Y P.S. The red
wine in the second recipe also helps tenderize the meat, in addition
to adding flavor. FROM: DONNA HARTMAN (HDDW83B)

Marinated Shark Steaks

foreign, main dish, seafood

1  ingredients:
1 1/2 lb shark steaks
2 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoon rice or wine vinegar (balsamic is *; delightful* here!)
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoon chopped parsley
1  clove garlick, pressed or minced
1/2 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper

minced green onions and parsley

(TIP):  Fish should be cooked only until it flakes easily. Check it
often to prevent overcooking, which will not only make it rubbery, it
will render it tasteless. A good way to check is to check it for
opacity. When it has turned from translucent to white and opaque it's
done. It will finish cooking  on its own with residual heat if
removed from the heat source.

Fish  is  a high protein but low-calorie main dish.
By  using  a light marinade  you  eliminate rich butter sauces and
still maintain the delicate flavor.

Cut the shark steaks into service-sized pieces.
Place them in  a glass dish.   Combine the soy sauce, vinegar, lemon
juice,  oil parsley, garlick and black pepper. Pour the marinade over
the fish and marinate for half an hour, turning at least once.

Remove  the fish (reserving the marinade)  and broil 4 to 5 inches
from the heat - about four minutes a side.
Brush with the marinade before turning.

Serve with minced green onions and parsley. Accompaniments: Rice and
vegetable pilaf,  leaf lettuce tossed with parsley-lemon dressing, and
French or Italian sourdough bread.

Mariscada - Brazilian Fish Stew

brazilian, fish

12  clams
1 lb mussels
2 tablespoon pure olive oil
1  large onion, diced
2  large ripe tomatoes, peeled,
1  seeded, coarsely chopped
2  cloves garlic, minced
1  sprig fresh cilantro, minced
1  salt&  black pepper to taste
1  cayenne pepper to taste
1  pinch of saffron threads
4 lb fresh codfish fillets, cut into ser; ving-size pieces
1 lb jb shrimp, peeled, deveined
1/2 lb fresh crabmeat, picked over for car; tilage

Clean the clams by scrubbing them thoroughly with a wire brush,
removing any beard or barnacles. Then place them in a large pot with
1 gallon of water or enough to cover, and 1/3 cup salt. Allow the
clams to remain for 20 minutes during which time they will expel the
sand inside. Continue this process, changing the water at least two
more times. The mussels are cleaned in a similar manner, but you must
leave them in the water for at least 2 hours. Throw away any clams or
mussels that float or are not tightly closed. Heat the olive oil in
the bottom of a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the
onion, tomatoes, garlic, coriander, salt, peppers, and saffron and
cook, stirring, until the onions have softened, but are not brown.
Add the fish and shellfish to the onion mixture. Cover with water and
bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, or
until the shellfish open. Discard any clams or mussels that do not
open. Serve hot.

Mark's Salmon Spread

chili, fish, spreads

8 oz cream cheese
1  stalk celery -- minced
1/2 cup crushed walnuts
1/2 cup minced green onion
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1  cucumber -- skinned and
1  sliced
1  thinly
1 pkg wheatsworth crackers
1  juice of one lemon (no lame
1  bottled
1  stuff!)
1  fresh ground black pepper
24  three inch by one inch
1 slice smoked
1  salmon
1 bunch fresh dill

Mix cheese, celery, walnuts, green onion, lemon juice, cayenne and
coriander until thoroughly combined. Obviously the heat can be
adjusted to taste, but you don't want to overpower the other flavors,
especially the salmon.  I figure if half your guests complain it's
too hot, and half say it could have been hotter, it's about right.

Place from  to 1 tsp. of the cheese mixture on the end of one of the
salmon strips, sprinkle with black pepper, and roll up jellyroll
style. These steps can be done a couple hours ahead of time, just
cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.

To serve, arrange crackers on serving tray.  Top each one with a
cucumber slice   Place a salmon roll on top of the cucumber slice and
garnish with a sprig of dill. Serves 5 to 10 people depending on how
gluttonous they are! Recipe By     : Mark P. Stevens via Chile-heads

Mct's Conch Chowder

potato, soup/stew

2 large onions, diced
1  bell pepper, diced
2 large potatoes, peeled & cubed
6 oz bacon, cut in 1/4 dice
1  15 oz. can tomato puree
1  8 oz. bottle clam juice
1  8 oz. can diced tomatoes in
1  juice
2 lb conch or clams, diced (see
1  note)
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon thyme, use fresh if
1  available
2 teaspoon black pepper
1  bay leaf, crushed
2 oz hot sauce or salsa (see
1  note)
1  jalapeno pepper, finely
1  diced

Saute bacon until soft-cooked; add green peppers and onion to skillet
and saute to al dente stage. Place in a large pot and add tomato
puree, diced tomatoes, clam juice, salt, pepper, bay leaf, thyme,
potatoes, jalapeno, hot sauce, and conch.  Bring to a low boil for 15
minutes, then simmer for 1 hour.  To hold until serving time, cool to
room temp- erature and refrigerate.

NOTE:  At McT's, the diced conch meat is marinated overnight in papaya
juice to tenderize it.  The papaya juice can be rinsed off with a
little left in to give a slight sweet flavor to the chowder. NOTE:
The resaurant uses Pico Pica hot sauce, usually only available to the
trade, but La Victoria hot salsa, which is more available, may be
substituted, Buchholz says.

From McT's Shrimp House and Tavern, 1523 Periwinkle Way, Sanibel
Island, FL.  General Manager Ron Buchholz figured out a home-size
version of McT's Conch Chowder. Recipe supplied by Lillian Austin,
former Food Editor of the Ft. Myers News Press from a cookbook she

Mee Krob (Crisp-Fried Noodles)

chicken, pasta, pork, seafood, thai

1  stephen ceideburg
2 tablespoon fish sauce
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
2  limes, juice only
3 tablespoon vinegar
1/4 cup brown sugar or half brown and half; palm sugar
1  oil, for deep-frying
6 oz rice sticks
4  eggs, lightly beaten
1 medium onion, finely diced
3  cloves garlic, minced
1 small red or green chile, seeds removed,; finely minced
3/4 lb minced pork, diced chicken, or peel; ed shrimp, or a mixture
2  green onions, sliced, for garnish

This special occasion noodle dish is a favorite in many Thai
restaurants. Some versions are extremely sweet and sticky; this
version is less so, but the important flavors are still sweet, sour,
and salty in that order. Be sure to use a large enough pan for
saucing the noodles (step 5); a 14-inch wok is ideal.

1. In a small bowl, combine fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice,
vinegar, and sugar and set aside.

2. In a wok or deep skillet, heat oil to 350 degrees F. Drop
approximately an ounce of rice sticks into the oil; they will puff up
and rise to the top of the oil in only a few seconds. Turn them over
once and fry until crisp, about 15 seconds in all. Transfer finished
noodles to a pan lined with paper towels and continue frying the
batter in small batches. Keep noodles warm in a low oven.

3. Dip a hand in the beaten egg and, holding your hand approximately 8
inches above the hot oil, drizzle egg over the surface in a random
pattern. Continue with about half the egg mixture, forming a lacy
network of egg. Fry until golden brown on underside, turn over once,
and brown other side. Transfer to a plate and drain on paper towels.
Repeat with remaining egg.

4. Heat a second wok over medium high heat and add approximately 2
tablespoons oil from the first wok. Add onion, garlic, and chile and
cook until they are fragrant. Add meats or shrimp and stir-fry just
until done.

5. Stir sugar mixture and add to wok. Bring to a boil and cook until
slightly thickened. Reduce heat to low and add about a quarter of the
fried noodles and eggs. Stir together and toss to break up noodle
clumps and coat with sauce. Continue adding noodles and eggs in
batches until all are coated with sauce. Transfer to serving platter
and garnish with sliced green onion.

Serves 4 with other dishes.

1 lb fish fillets
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon salt
4 oz crab meat or
1  2 crabs; cooked and cut into piece
5 tablespoon oil
8 cup ; water
2 teaspoon salt
1 lb rice vermicelli*
1 lb fresh bean sprouts
1 large cucumber; peeled and coarsely grate
8  spring onions (scallions)
1/2 cup fresh mint leaves; firmly packed
1  soup
2 medium onions; quartered; finely sliced
2 centiliter garlic; finely chopped
2 teaspoon grated lemon rind; finely chopped
2 teaspoon laos powder**
8  candlenuts; finely grated***
6  dried chillies; seeds removed
2 teaspoon dried shrimp paste (blacan)
2 teaspoon ground turmeric
4 teaspoon ground coriander
1  prawn stock with seafood see above
8 cup coconut milk
2 teaspoon sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon salt; or to taste

*  This is also known as rice sticks and is available in Chinese
groceries. ** A very delicate spice sold in powder form. Also known
as kha in Thai cooking. Available in Asian groceries. ***A hard nut
with lots of oil used to flavor curries.  Also known as kemiri
(Indonesian) or buah keras (Malay). Available in Asian groceries.

Shell and devein prawns, reserving shells and heads. Drain these
thoroughly.  Remove any bones and skin from fish fillets and using a
chopper, chop very finely. Mix in the salt and pepper and shape into
small balls, or into a sausage-shaped roll and divide into
finger-width slices. Pick over crab meat and discard any bony tissue,
or chop the whole crabs into pieces after removing top shell and
fibrous tissue.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a saucepan and when very hot throw in the
prawn heads and shells and fry until they turn bright red. Add 8 cups
water and 2 teaspoons salt, cover and simmer 20-30 minutes, then
strain. Discard shells and heads.  Return the stock to the fire, drop
in the fish balls or slices and the prawns, cut into pieces if large.
Return to the boil, then lower heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes.  Set
aside and keep warm.

Scald the rice vermicelli by pouring boiling water over it, then
allow it to drain in a colander.  Or soak it in warm water for 5-10
minutes, drain well. Scald the bean sprouts by pouring boiling water
over. Rinse in cold water, washing off any loose skins. Pinch off
straggly brown "tails." Slice spring onions finely, roughly chop mint
leaves. Set aside each ingredient separately] until serving time.

TO MAKE THE SOUP:  Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil and fry the
onions, garlic, and lemon rind until onions are golden. Stir in the
laos powder, candlenuts, chillies, blacan, turmeric and coriander.
Add the prawn stock and when the soup comes to the boil add the
coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for
10-15 minutes, stirring to prevent coconut milk curdling.

In each bowl, arrange a ladle of the vermicelli, enough to two-thirds
fill the bowl.  Add a handful of bean sprouts, a tablespoon each of
cucumber, and sliced spring onions. Add also a large pinch of mint.
Pour the boiling soup over and serve immediately.  A hot sambal can
be served along with this for individuals to add to their portion if
desired. Serves 8-10. Source:  The Complete Asian Cookbook.

Mock Lobster

seafood

2 lb haddock; fillet
1  tomato juice; or v8/to cover
1/2 cup chili sauce
1/2 cup horseradish; prepared
1/4 cup sour cream

Poach fish in tomato juice to cover with spices of your choice or in
V8. Simmer until fish flakes. Mix the other ingredients together and
adjust for YOUR taste. Add the sauce to the fish...making sure it is
not too thick. It should look like lobster salad and you can use
diced celery and/or onion. In the 50's whenever you went to a
luncheon at the Temple it seems that this was the dish of choice. I
guess we were trying to prove we could have 'lobster' and be kosher
too, <GRIN>!!!! Anyway it is quite good. If you have a fovorite
lobster or shrimp salad; you could just substitute the fish. Back in
those days it was cheaper...now who knows??? Recipe originally taken
from the LEVITTOWN JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER COOKBOOK; circa 1956.

Monkfish Kebabs

fish

1 1/2 lb monkfish
1  red or 1 green pepper
      ----FOR THE MARINADE----
1  juice of a lemon
4 tablespoon olive oil
1  clove of garlic
1  salt and pepper
1 teaspoon freeze-dried rosemary or fresh spri; gs

Cut fish into 1 inch cubes. wash pepper and deseed it. Cut into 1 inch
pieces. To make marinade, mix olive oil, lemon juice, crushed clove of
garlic and rosemary in a glass or china bowl. Do not use metal. Add
salt and pepper. Put in fish, turning occasionally. Keep in marinade
in fridge for 90 minutes to 2 hours. It can stay in the marinade for
up to six hours, but not longer. When you're ready to cook kebabs,
put fish on to skewers, not more than 3 or 4 cubes on each skewer,
with pieces of pepper between each cube. Begin and end with pepper.
Make sure all the pieces touch, but don't squash together. Push all
up to sharp end, leaving a long handle to hold easily under grill or
on barbecue. Line grill with foil - saves washing up! - and grill for
5 to 6 minutes a side. Do not put them too close to the heat - they
will burn on the outside before they are cooked inside - these cubes
are really meaty. They should take about 10 to 12 minutes to cook
properly so they are succulent inside with wonderful borwn crispy
bits on the outside. Serve with a rice pilau or even just crusty
bread with some lemon juice to squeeze over them.

1 lb monkfish
1  flour
1/4 cup butter
3/4 cup white wine, approximately

3/4 cup heavy cream, about
3 1/2 tablespoon peeled, sliced ginger, set aside in; a bowl of water

2 lb white fish bones
2 medium onions, thinly sliced
17 oz white wine, approximately
34 oz water, approximately
1  bay leaf

This one comes from the Japanese consulate, but is obviously not a

pepper++not traditional Japanese ingredients.

From Hisashi Vakada, Japanese Consulate.

Saute the vegetables in a small amount of oil.  Season with salt and
pepper.  Set aside.

Cut the monkfish into 4 pieces, one for each person. Season fish with
salt and pepper; dip into a little flour and shake lightly. Put the
butter in a baking pan, add the fish, and bake in a 350F oven for
about 10 minutes. Set aside and keep warm.

Combine wine and fish stock in a saucepan.  Place over medium-high
heat and reduce until only a small amount of liquid remains in the
bottom of the pan, turn off the heat. Add heavy cream. Cook over low
heat for 3 to 5 minutes.  Add vegetables.  Drain ginger and add to
sauce. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over fish
before serving.

Serves 4.

FISH STOCK:

Melt the butter in a stockpot; add fish bones and saute. Be careful
bones don't stick or burn.  Add onion slices and white wine. Turn
heat to high. Reduce liquid by half, skimming the top to remove
residue.

Turn the heat to low.  Add water and herbs.  Simmer for 2 to 3
minutes. Strain and reserve the stock. Discard bones.

Moroccan-Jewish Fish Filets With Red Peppers

fish

1  stephen ceideburg
1/4 cup vegetable oil or olive oil
2  red bell peppers stemmed, seeded di; ced
20  garlic cloves, minced
6 tablespoon minced cilantro
1 1/2 lb sea bass or halibut filets
1  salt and pepper, to taste
1 teaspoon paprika
2 cup water

This flavorful fish dish, dotted with bright red peppers, cilantro
leaves and a generous amount of garlic, is a favorite of Moroccan
Jews. It is simple to make and is delicious hot or cold.

Heat the oil in a saute pan large enough to hold fish in a single
layer. Add the peppers and saute lightly over medium heat for 2
minutes. Add garlic and cilantro and cook over low heat, stirring,
for 1 minute.

Add fish and sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika. Add water and
bring to a simmer, basting fish occasionally. Cover and cook over
very low heat about 8 minutes, or until fish is just tender (when a
thin skewer is inserted into center of fish, it should come out hot
to the touch).

Using a slotted spoon, transfer fish to a deep platter. Boil the pan
juices, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 1/2 cup. Taste for
seasoning, then pour over fish. Serve hot or cold. PER SERVING: 250

Muggine In Bianco

jewish, seafood

4 lb striped bass
1 small onion, sliced
1  carrot, sliced
1  stalk celery, coarsely chopped
1  lemon sliced
1/4 teaspoon whole peppercorns
1  salt
1  white pepper
1 cup home made mayonnaise made with oliv; e oil

Fish must be absolutely fresh. Clean the fish well making sure the
gills are removed from the head. Separate the head from the body and
remove all bones from fish. Save head and bones. Place onion, carrot,
celery, one slice lemon and the peppercorns into a fish poacher. Add
the fish filets, the head and the bones. Add cold water to cover and
1/2 tsp salt. Simmer, covered, for 10 - 20 minutes or until done. The
fish is done when the eye pops out a little and the meat flakes.
Remove from heat. Carefully pick out any pieces of meat avoiding
bones and vegetables and arrange inside a fish mold or on an oval
serving plate. Lightly season with salt, white pepper and lemon
juice. Strain the broth and return to the stove. Let it boil
uncovered until the liquid is reduced to about a cup, then pour it
over the fish and refrigerate until the gelatin is firm. To serve,
unmold and cut in half lengthwise with a sharp knife. Then cut each
half into four or five pieces diagonally forming a fishbone pattern.
Mask the cuts under a swirl of mayonnaise so the effect looks like a
whole fish. Cut the lemon slices and arrange around the fish to look
like fins.

Mushroom Filled With Salmon Filet

chinese, seafood, vegetables

1  salmon steak, fresh
      ----FILLING----
1  mushrooms, inoki, - julienne
1  carrot, julienne
1  mushroom, shitake, - julienne
1  celery, julienned
1  salt (to taste)
1  pepper (to taste)
1  oil, for frying
      ----BRAISING SAUCE----

2 tablespoon shallot, minced
2 tablespoon rice wine

in a small bowl and stir and set aside.

Assembly: =========

Into each of the two salmon "sandwich" pieces, add a touch of salt
and pepper to taste and then add portions of Shitake, and Inoki
mushroom, celery and carrot as filling for the "sandwiches."

Close up the "sandwiches" and set aside.

To Cook: ========

In a small saute pan, heat a bit of peanut oil over high heat
until it begins to smoke and then put the salmon sandwiches in to
brown both sides (about 1 minute each side.)

When both sides are browned, add the braising sauce to the salmon.
Cover and braise over medium heat until the salmon is done ( 2 to 3
minutes).

Transfer the cooked salmon sandwiches to a serving plate and serve
with cakes of sticky rice and garnish with julienne fans of Szechuan
pickle.

Top with drippings from the saute pan, and pieces of Cilantro.

Mussels Marinara

italian, main dish, seafood

2 lb mussels
2 lb tomato
1/2 cup red wine
1 each mushrooms

My own creation.  Clean 2lbs. mussels in H2O & lots of black pepper
for an hour & then drain. Clean beards off mussels. In a large pan,
saute garlic in 2 tbls of olive oil, slow heat. Add basil leaves,
Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes,  parsley,>> onions, mushrooms
and green pep- pers. Everything should be fresh,esp mushrooms & add
ingredientes to taste. I add a lot because I love full flavors. Saute
for 15 minutes and then add 2- 1 lb cans or larger, of peeled
tomatoes. Break the tomatoes with your hands & blend. Cover and
simmer for 1 hour, stirring frequently. Add 2 fresh, diced
tomatoesand cook for another 10-15 min longer. Add 1/4-1/2cup of dry
red wine &cook for another 10 minutes. Don't over-heat, don't dry up
the sauce. I love my sauces watery as you seem to. Adjust seasonings
to taste as you go.
Use freshly grated parmasan AND romano cheese for the top- ping &add
all on top of cooked pasta. Add fresh pepper- black &/or red. Serve
with a DARK green salad and serve with a slightly chilled Chianti red
wine. Add candle light and with Classical guitar in the background
makes quite an >>>>>>> evening.  I hope you can adjust the seasonings
to your lik- ing because that's how I cook-according to my taste.  I
get rave reviews for my cuisian so it can work. Enjoy!

cook garlic and onion til soft over mod. heat. Add the leek and cook

My Father's Oyster Stew

seafood, stews

1 pint oysters
1/2 cup oyster liquor
1 quart milk
1 pint half & half
1 cup cream
2 tablespoon butter
1  salt; to taste
1  pepper; to taste

Heat milk, half and half, and cream to the boiling point but do not
boil. At the same general time, but obviously later because the
volume of liquid is smaller, heat the oyster liquor in a separate
pan. When the milk is hot, throw the butter in to melt. Add some salt
and lots of pepper (I like to use a coarse grind pepper). When the
liquor is hot, add the oysters. Continue to heat the liquor plus
oysters until the oysters just begin to curl at the edges, maybe two
minutes. Then dump the oysters and liquor into the milk.  "Correct
the seasonings" and serve it forth.

My wife likes to add paprika to hers at the table. I like oyster
crackers with mine, and in general like the little commercial ones
rather than the more elegant and expensive ones. You can fiddle with
this recipe all you want - more milk and less cream, or vice versa;
more pepper and salt (I like lots of both); fewer oysters - it really
comes down to your taste.

My Grandmother's Gefilte Fish Recipe

seafood

1  buffalo; (or other fatty fis
1  salmon
      Walleye pike ----broth-----
4  onions; cut in half
4  celery stalks; including lea
2  carrots
      Fish bones and skin ----fish balls-
2 large onions; coarsely ground
1 teaspoon sugar; (optional)
1 teaspoon white pepper
1  salt; to taste
1/4 cup matzo meal; approximately
4  whites
2  yolks
1/2 cup extremely cold water; * see

Recipe by: maury@turing.eecs.uic.edu (Maurine Neiberg) NOTES:

Have the fish market fillet them and give you the bones and skin for
broth. At this time of year the fish market will probably grind the
fish for you too, which is an enormous time saver.

Fish fillets ground through a meat grinder. Sometimes the fish market
will do this for you.  Food processors do not work well for this. The
texture is wrong, too mushy.)

* put in freezer, but make sure there's no ice in it.

Broth: Put above ingredients in the largest pot you own and cover it
with water.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 2-3 hours. This should
make a fairly rich stock.

In a wooden bowl, using a round bladed chopper chop ground fish and
ground onions.  Use a turning motion, working as much air in a
possible. (This is where the visual aids come in handy.) Chop for
about 10 minutes. Add matzo meal and spices and keep chopping using
the same motions (about 5 more minutes).  Beat egg whites until
frothy (not stiff) and pour over the fish mixture.  Beat egg yolks
well, add the very cold water and pour over fish mixture.  DO NOT
MIX.  Chop the mixture, adding more air, until eggs are well worked
in.

Strain fish broth and bring back to a gentle simmer. Make balls of
the fish mixture (handle as little as possible) and drop gentley in
broth. Peel and slice carrots into 1/4 inch rounds and add to broth.
Partially cover and simmer for about 2 hours.  Turn the balls
occasionally if there are too many for them to turn on their own.

When cooked, remove fish balls and place in a single layer in storage
containers.  Remove carrot slices from broth and put one carrot on
each fish ball. Refrigerate.

Bring fish broth to a boil and boil lightly for about 3 hours, or
until reduced to 1/3 - 1/2 of its original volume. Pour reduces broth
over fish balls and refrigerate until cold and broth has jelled.
Serve cold with horse raddish.

Serves about 20 people with leftovers.

Nero Wolfe's Bacalhau (Portuguese Salt Cod)

seafood

1 1/2 lb to 2 lb soaked dried cod *
2 large onions, sliced
6 tablespoon butter
1 centiliter garlic, minced
3 large potatoes
2 tablespoon bread crumbs
10  pitted green olives
10  black olives
4  hard-cooked eggs
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1  wine vinegar
1  olive oil
1  fresh ground black pepper

* NOTE: To prepare dried cod, soak in cold water for about 24 hours,
or until it is completely moistened. Change the water two or three
times. Drain thoroughly.

Put the cod into a saucepan and add enough cold water to cover. Bring
to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the
fish is tender. Drain; remove skin and bones. Flake the meat with a
fork into large pieces. Saute the onions in 3 tablespoons of butter
until they are tender and golden in color. Add the garlic. Boil the
unpeeled potatoes in salted water. When they are tender (about 20
minutes), remove from the heat, put under cold running water, and
remove the skins. Drain and slice into 1/4-inch pieces. Preheat the
oven to 350 deg.F. Grease a 1 1/2-quart casserole with the remaining
3 tablespoons of butter. Arrange a layer of half the potatoes, then
half the cod, then half the onions. Sprinkle with a little pepper and
repeat the layering. Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the top layer.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated through and lightly browned.
Before serving, garnish the top with olives and eggs; sprinkle with
parsley. Serve with the wine vinegar and oil in cruets and black
pepper in a small dish.

Never Fail Batter

dips, seafood

1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 cup water
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon oil

Mix all of the ingredients together and blend until there are no
lumps. Preheat the oil in your deep fat fryer to the proper
temperature for the food you are cooking.

Dry the fish or the vegetables with a paper towel and dip into the
batter. Place in the hot oil one piece at a time. Try to keep the
pieces from colliding until the batter has had a chance to set (which
it does almost instantly).

Cook until the batter has turned a golden brown, remove to a paper
towel to drain and serve at once. This is very good to use for
zucchini, broccoli, peppers, green beans, onion rings and any other
firm vegetable.

fish, main dish

6 lb fresh salmon
6 tablespoon butter
3  lemons
1  salt
1  pepper

Clean salmon and remove head, tail and fins. Cut the salmon into 1 lb
steaks (not fillets). Place 1 salmon steak onto a sheet of foil,
squeeze the juice of 1/2 a lemon, spread 1 tb of butter plus salt and
pepper on the salmon. Wrap the salmon steak tightly in the foil
(heavy duty) so as to make the best water tight seal as possible.
Repeat for each steak. Boil the packages in water for 20 minutes.
Remove and place in the freezer for an hour then refrigerate for 2
hours. When ready to serve, unwrap the salmon steaks carefully on a
large platter and cover with warm Hollandaise Sauce. To accompany the
salmon, this dish should be served with new baby potatoes which have
been boiled with mint leaves, and fresh garden peas, plus a palatable
white wine. This is a very basic but absolutely delicious recipe. Of
course, the fun is catching the salmon and telling the story of how
the large one snapped the rod like a pretzel and "got away"!

Northwest Grilled Salmon

fish, grill

1  whole salmon fillet -- * see
1  note
2 tablespoon butter -- melted
3 tablespoon honey -- melted
1 tablespoon dill weed
2 cup alder wood chips -- opt

Have the samon filleted leaving the skin on. This is important. Keep
cold. Melt together and melt the butter and honey in the micro or
another way. Lay the fillet out skin side down and pour over or
quickly brush on the honey and butter. Sprinkle the dill weed over.
By having the filet cold the honey and butter mixture will congeal
and the filet will be easy to handle. Place the filet skin side UP
over a moderate grill. As soon as the meat just starts to firm up
turn to skin side down. (The skin will keep the filet together)
Remove from the grill as soon as the meat starts to flake. On large
filets I use two spatulas.Serve with a green salad and augratin
potatos.

1/2 cup olive oil
1  pinch rosemary
1  bay leaf
1  pinch oregano
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1  chopped parsley
1  green chili pepper chopped
1/2 lb tomatoes -- peeled and cut
3  cloves garlic chopped
1  salt and pepper
1 lb spaghetti

The octopus must be very carefully washed and dried, and the mouth
removed. Cover the bottom of a saucepan with oil; add the rosemary,
bay leaf oregano, cumin seeds, parley, chili pepper, tomatoes and
chopped garlic. Place the octopus on top of this mixture and season
with salt and pepper. Cover the pot very tightly and simmer for about
45 minutes. Cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water
until it is 'al dente' (firm to the bite). Drain and turn onto a warm
serving dish. Mix the octopus sauce into the spaghetti. Serve piping
hot. NOTE: I used cleaned fresh squid from the fish counter...easier
and cheaper!

Octopus With Garlic - Polipi Veraci All'aglio

garlic, italian, seafood

2  octopus (about 1 1/2 pounds each)
1/4 cup olive oil
5  cloves garlic, crushed
1  bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1  salt
1 small green pepper, chopped

rosemary leaves and parsley

Cut out the eyes and mouth of the octopus. Remove the ink sac and
internal bone. Cut off the tough points in the tentacles. Put each
octopus on a board and beat them well to break the fibers and make
the meat more tender. Wash them in running water until they are very
white; do not dry but put them in an earthen- ware dish and season
with oil, flavored with garlic, bay leaf and cumin seeds. Cover the
dish tightly with a sheet of waxed paper or foil tied around the top
with string. Put the dish over a very low heat between 1 and 2 hours,
according to the size of the octopus. When they are tender, drain
them, season with additional oil, salt, green pepper, rosemary leaves
and parsley. Serve in a tureen.

It doesn't make reference to it in the text, but in the pictures of
both these dishes, it shows one or two largish octopi garnished with
reseattes of baby octopi tentacles. I imagine you'd do quite well
using the 'baby' octopi like those I see sold around here in the
supermarkets, or even with squid.

1 bunch fennel; chopped
4  tomatoes (fresh or canned)  peeled,; seeded & chopped

liquid after pounding. Wash thoroughly, then drain and cook in a
covered pan without adding water until the octopus turns bright
pink-red and feels tender.  Using a sharp knife, cut into rounds the
width of a small finger. Heat the oil in a tsikali or any pot, add
the onion, and cook until translucent and soft.  Add the round
octopus slices to the onion and pour in the wine, and simmer for 15

2 tablespoon olive oil
1  green bell pepper; chopped
1 small green hot pepper; ribbed, seeded, and mince
2  garlic cloves; minced
3  tomatoes; peeled and coarsely chopp
1/2 lb tiny or small shrimp; (raw best, but cooked and

2 tablespoon flour
1/4 cup dry white wine
3/4 cup ; water from cooking the on
1  8-oz can tomato sauce
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs

Peel the onions and boil in water for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and
cool. Reserve the cooking water. When the onions are cool enough to
handle, scoop out the centers, leaving a shell about 1/4 inch thick.
Set aside the shells and pulp.

Heat the olive oil and saute the bell pepper with the hot pepper
until they are soft.  Add the garlic and cook for only a minute or
two before adding the tomatoes. Continue cooking until most of the
juice evaporates. Stir in the shrimp, coriander, and salt and pepper

shells and place them in a small ovenproof casserole.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Heat 2 tablespoons butter and saute 1
cup of the reserved onion pulp until the onions are translucent.
Sprinkle with the flour and stir until the mixture browns uniformly.
Immediately add the wine, the reserved water from the onions, and the
tomato sauce. Simmer for about 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens.

Pour the sauce over the stuffed onions.  Sprinkle with the bread
crumbs and dot with the remaining tablespoon of butter broken into
bits. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15 to 20 minutes or until nicely
browned. Source: Narsai M. David.
