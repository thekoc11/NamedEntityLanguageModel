A Jellie Of Fyshe

seafood

8 oz cod
3  scallops
3 oz shrimp
2 onions sliced
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 oz ginger root, peeled,
1 finely chopped
1/3 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
2 cup white wine
2 cup water
3/4 oz gelatin

Put the codfish (or other white fish) in a pan with the onions,
vinegar, ginger root, spices, wine and water. Bring it gently to the
boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the scallops and prawns and cook
for a further 3 minutes. Remove the fish; bone and skin the white
fish and set it all aside. Strain the cooking juices and set aside to
cool for several hours by which time a lot of the sediment will have
settled in the bottom of the bowl. Carefully pour off the juices,
leaving the sediment, and then strain several times through a clean
teacloth. You should have appoximately 3 cups of liquid left. Melt
3/4 oz of gelatin in a little of the liquid, cool it to room
temperature, then mix it into the rest of the juices. Pour a thin
layer (1/2 inch) of the juice into the bottom of a 5 cup souffle dish
or fish mold and put it in the fridge to set. Flake the white fish
into smallish flakes; remove the coral from the scallops and cut the
white flesh into three of four pices. Once the jelly is firm, arrange
the most decorative of the fish in the bottom of the dish-- some
scallop coral in the middle, prawns around the outsides, flakes of
white fish in between or however you feel inspired. Spoon a little
more of the juice and return it to the fridge to set. Continue to
layer the fish in the mould, setting each layer with a covering of
juice until you have used up all the fish and juices. Leave the jelly
to set for at least 4 hours in a fridge. Unmold and decorate with
fresh herbs; serve as a starter.

Abalone Meuniere Mandarin

chinese, seafood

5 (7 1/2-ounce) cans mexican abalone
8 oz shrimp
4 oz fat pork
4 oz water chestnuts, minced
1 pinch chives
1 ginger water, to taste (see note)
1 salt and msg
1 oz maize (corn) flour
4 oz chive and ginger oil (see note)
2 oz flour
3  eggs, beaten
5/8 oz shaoxing wine
6 oz chicken stock

The following four recipes are from a Chron article called "Foreign
Intrigue" by Alice Cuneo that featured recipes from various
consulates in the City.  This first one is from the Consulate of the
People's Republic of China.  It's a sophisticated (but uncomplicated)
banquet dish featuring abalone, shrimp and porkfat.

Abalone stuffed with minced shrimp, from Shen Xuliang of the Chinese
consulate.

Trim the abalone, removing rough parts, and cut into flat rounds. Chop
shrimp and fat pork to a paste consistency; stir in the water
chestnuts, chives and ginger water. Season with salt and MSG.

Create the abalone "sandwiches" by spreading an abalone round with
shrimp paste, then topping with another round. Dredge "sandwiches" in
maize flour and set aside.

Heat chive and ginger oil in a wok over medium heat, swirling the oil
to coat all sides of the wok.

Dip the abalone "sandwiches" in the flour, then in eggs. Fry in the
hot oil until abalone is tender and golden. Add Shaoxing wine,
chicken stock, salt and MSG. Bring to a simmer, adjust the seasonings
and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve immediately.

NOTE:  Chive and ginger oil is oil in which chives and ginger have
been cooked.  To make at home, heat 4 ounces oil in a wok set over
medium heat. Toss in 1 or 2 tablespoons fresh snipped chives and 3
slices fresh ginger. Stir-fry until fragrant, then proceed with
recipe. (Remove ginger slices before serving.)

Ginger water is available in Chinese markets.

From the San Francisco Chronicle, 6/15/88.

salads, seafood

2 sm head red leaf lettuce
1 bunch arugula *
1 small head radicchio**
12 fresh shiitake mushrooms
24 chinese pea pods
4 fresh medium abalone
2  limes,or more (juice only)
1  1 -in. fresh gingerroot ***
1 freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
4 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

flat end of cleaver until tender and almost transparent but not
shredded. Combine juice of 1 lime, 1 tablespoon grated ginger and
grind or two of fresh pepper in bowl. Add abalone slices and toss to

Adobong Pusit (Squid With Garlic & Tomato)

ethnic, seafood

1/2 kg small fresh squids
1/2 cup native vinegar
10 cloves garlic
1 salt and pepper to taste
1 medium onion, sliced
2 medium tomatoes, chopped
1 extra salt and pepper for seasoning
1 teaspoon vet-sin (monosodium glutamate)

Got down my single Filipino cook book and found this little gem. My
grasp of Tagalog is non-existent but I'd guess that the name
translates as "Squid Adobo". At any rate, it's squid stewed in
vinegar. I assume that the reference to "native vinegar" refers to
nipa sap vinegar (sukang paombong). The bottle I have is a milky
looking vinegar that tastes pretty much like any vinegar so I imagine
that you have some latitude on what type you can use.

For those of you who have never tried it, Filipino food is an
intriguing cuisine that has elements of Southeast Asian, Chinese and
Mexican or Spanish influences. It has everything from spring rolls
(lumpias) to rellenos dishes.

Wash the squids very well.  Remove the long thin membrane in the head
and slit the eyes to bring out the ink. Place the squids in a
saucepan with vinegar, 6 cloves garlic crushed, salt and pepper.
Cover and cook slowly until the squids are tender.  Cut cooked squids
into 1/2 inch slices crosswise.

Crush remaining garlic and saute in a little lard in another pan. Add
the onion and tomatoes and cook until tomatoes are very soft. Add the
squids and the liquid in which they were boiled. Simmer for 7
minutes. Season with salt, pepper and vet-sin.

Adolf Frey's Pike Quenelles

fish, german

2 1/2 lb pike, skinned & boned
1 1/4 cup ; water
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2  eggs
1 cup butter, unsalted
1  ; salt & fresh ground pepp
4 eggs yolks
      ----WHITE SAUCE----
1 quart chicken stock, hmmade or can
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
1  ; salt & fresh ground pepp
1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese

Author's note: Adolph Frey owns one of the few Michelin-rated 2-star
restaurants in Germany. He made this dish at the lodge for Carl's
birthday celebration 1 year. Quenelles are poached fish-&-egg mounds
traditionally made w/pike.

To make quenelles, grind pike in food processor, or use a tamis if
you have one. Set aside.

Bring water to a boil. Sift in flour & stir until water is absorbed.
Keep stirring so that mixture doesn't stick to pan. Remove from heat
& beat in 1 egg. Cool mixture, then refrigerate until cold. Remove
mixture from refrigerator & blend it in food processor until smooth.
This is the panade.

Cream butter in small bowl. Put ground pike in bowl that is set inside

1 pinch salt
1 cup ; water
      ----BECHAMEL THICK SAUCE----
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  pepper, white

water into the flour, then knead to a smooth elastic dough, about 10
minutes. Roll the dough out as thinly as possible in two sheets.

remaining Sauce ingredients.  Cook until a slight boil.

ASSEMBLY:  On one sheet of the pasta arrange teaspoons of the
stuffing in litle piles at regular intervals, about 1 1/2 inches
apart. Cover with the second sheet of dough and press with the finger
tips around the edges of the stuffing.  Cut the Agnolotti square with
a pastry wheel and make quite sure the edges are firmly sealed.
Sprinkle lightly with flour and let them rest for 30 minutes,turning
them after 15 minutes.

COOKING:  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the
Agnolotti and cook for 12 minutes.  Lift them out with a slotted

Akotonshi (Stuffed Crabs)

seafood

1 teaspoon salt
1 inch fresh ginger root
6 whole cloves
4 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 small onion -- minced
1 teaspoon ground ginger
2 tomatoes -- finely chopped
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 bell peppers -- finely
1  chopped
1 pinch paprika
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon dried shrimp -- from
1 oriental shop
1/2 cup bread crumbs -- whole wheat
1 egg -- hard boiled chopped
1 sprig parsley
2 lb crab meat

[I think this recipe assumes raw crabmeat to start; refer to
instructions below about boiling crab meat and alter technique if
using pre-cooked crab meat, perhaps by just boiling some ginger and
cloves in small amount of water and adding a bit to flavor crab. --
cmt]

Put crab meat in boiling salted water along with ginger piece and
cloves. Cook about 15 minutes, until meat is tender enough to flake
with a fork. Drain, flake and set aside.

In a heavy pot, heat oil to a moderate temperature and add other
ingredients in the following sequence, stirring for a minute or so
between each: onions, ground ginger, tomatoes, tomato paste, green
pepper, paprika, cayenne, and dried shrimp.  Reduce heat and simmer
for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly, until vegetables are cooked.
Add crab meat and stir another couple of minutes to heat it through.
Then spoon the mixture into clean crab shells or ramekins (small
individual baking dishes).

Sprinkle bread crumbs on top of each crab and toast under an oven
broiler, being careful not to let the crumbs scorch. Garnish with egg
and parsley.

Antipasti Alla Noemi

appetizers, italian, seafood

1 lb squid (opt, but highly recommended)
1 white wine
24  mussels, fresh in-shell; or
24  oysters, fresh in-shell
16 crab claws, cooked
1 lb lobster meat, freshly cooked
16  prawns; cooked, peeled
1 lb shrimp, med; cooked, peeled
1/2 lb shrimp, popcorn; cooked
16 lemon wedges
3/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 can mushrooms packed in oil
1 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup catsup
1  brandy; to taste
1  worcestershire; to taste

Have your fish dealer prepare the squid (skin, remove the long bone
on the inside, the yellow deposit, and the ink sac). Wash the squid
well, dry thoroughly, and cut crosswise into 1/4" slices resembling
rings. Poach in white wine to cover just until tender. Drain. Cool to
room temperature.

Thoroughly wash and scrub the mussels, removing grit and sand. Place
the mussels in a large pot. Pour in 1/2 cup boiling water, cover and
steam over medium heat for 5 minutes or until the shells open. They
should be cooked and served the same day you buy them.

Arrange an assortment of the seafood attractively on 8 plates.
Garnish with lemon wedges. Whisk together the oil and lemon juice,
and drizzle the mixture over the seafood. Using a whisk, combine the
mayonnaise, catsup, brandy, and Worchestershire sauce. Serve a dollop
of this sauce on each plate.

Venetian cooking allows the delicate flavor of the seafood full rein.
This antipasto is actually a filling first course.

Arroz De Polvo (Octopus Rice)

portuguese, seafood

2 lb octopus
1 cup red wine
3/4 cup olive oil
1  onion; chopped
2 garlic clove; finely chopped
3  tomato; skinned & chopped
1 large bell pepper, green; chopped
1  salt; to taste
1  pepper; to taste
1 chilli powder; to taste
1 lb rice, short grain

Precook octopus in red wine with a little water. The octopus will
exude liquid so that you are likely to end up with more cooking
liquid at the end. Retain this and add water to make it up to 2-1/2
cups. Cut the drained octopus into small pieces.

Heat olive oil in a large saucepan; add a chopped onion and cook
gently, stirring, for 2 or 3 minutes. Add garlic, tomatoes, and
pepper. Season with salt, pepper and chilli powder to taste. Cook for
a few minutes longer.

Add the cooking liquid from the octopus and bring it to the boil. Add
rice (preferably a short-grain risotto rice like arborio) and bring
back to the boil, then turn the heat very low and put the lid on the
saucepan. After 15 minutes, stir to ensure the rice is not catching
on the bottom of the saucepan. In 5 minutes more, taste a grain or
two to make sure it is soft. The rice should still be quite damp.

Serve.

2 tablespoon lemon juice
1 cup milk -- or more as needed
2 cup flour
3 cup pancake mix
2 cup club soda (approx.)
1 teaspoon basil
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 cooking oil

lemon juice and refrigerate 3-4 hours. Drain off milk. Dip fillets in
flour to coat each piece lightly. Letdry on a cookie sheet, making
sure pieces do not tough. Add oil to deep fryer or heavy pan to a
depth of at least 3 inches. Heat oil to 425~. Combine pancake mix,
basil, pepper, garlic salt and enough soda to make a thick batter,
about the consistency of buttermilk. Dip floured fillets in batter
and add to the hot oil one at a time. Fry 4-5 minutes. Remove filets
to cookie sheet, again, not letting them touch and keep warm in a
250~ oven. Deep fry remaining filets, keeping the depth of the oil at
least 3 inches. NOTE: Do notheap fish as this creates steam in the
oven and makes coating soft.

Artichoke & Oyster Souffle

seafood, vegetables

4 medium artichokes
1 medium lemon, halved
1 oyster souffle base **
1 oyster sauce **

** See recipes for Oyster Souffle Base, and Oyster Sauce.

Trim the artichokes and rub the cut ends with lemon. (This
prevents oxidation which can turn the ends of the artichokes brown.)

Drop the artichokes into boiling salted water and cook for 30
minutes or until the bottoms are just tender and a leaf pulls out
with only slight resistance.

Remove the choke from the water, re-form the cooked artichoke and
stuff with the souffle base.

Preheat your oven to 375 F.

Bake for 20 minutes or until the souffle is puffed and brown.

Serve topped with Oyster Sauce.

3/4 lb prawns; raw
1 1/4 tablespoon beans, black
1 garlic cloves; chopped
1  scallions; chopped
1 tablespoon oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon oil
1 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce, light
1 teaspoon wine, white

Wash black beans two times and mash into a paste; then add the
chopped garlic.
Combine remaining ingredients, EXCEPT the oil. Pour mixture over
prawns; then, pour oil on top. Cover and steam 10 minutes. Serve over

Asparagus With Oyster Sauce

seafood

1 fresh asparagus; 6 or 7 spea
1 fresh or frozen oysters; all
2 tablespoon dry white wine
2 egg yolks
20  butter
1  salt, pepper, cayenne

Recipe by: ianst@qdpii.ind.dpi.qld.gov.au (Ian Staples) Another recipe
courtesy of John Morris, butcher and caterer in Rockhampton,
Queensland, Australia, as discussed on ABC [Australian Broadcasting
Corp.] Radio on Sunday 13 March 1994 in the "Queensland Sunday"
programme.

John opened the discussion by stating that this is NOT a Lenten meal
;-) (He recommended it for breakfast in bed on Sunday mornings in
fact.)

Allow 6 or 7 spears per person.  Not too thin and not too old.

Trim bottom 1" of the asparagus spears and peel the lower part if
necessary (shouldn't be required if you've selected the bunches
correctly and trimmed off the bottoms) then poach them gently - get
about 1" of water boiling in

Cut the oysters into thin strips rather than serving them as lumps.

Reserve the juice from the oyster shells - should get about 2
tablespoon fr Mix this with the dry white wine and reduce over heat
by about 2/3rds (i.e. you'll have about 1 1/2 tablespoon left).

Add this liquor and about 4 tablespoon of the poaching water slowly
to the and whisk them over very low heat until light and frothy
(note: do not have the liquor or the other fluid too hot when adding
to the eggs - you don't want to curdle them).

Add seasoning.  Then draw the sauce together by adding 20 gram of
*cold* di butter and stirring it in gently. Add the oyster strips and
fold through.

Lay the freshly cooked asparagus spears on the serving plates and
pour the oyster sauce over them (fairly now ;-).

Baby Leeks With Tomato Confit

fish, side dishes, vegetables

      ----LEEK MOLDS----
72 baby leeks
      ----TOMATO GELATIN----
1 pkg unflavoured gelatin
3/4 cup cold water
16 cherry tomatoes, halved
      ----TOMATO CONFIT----
1 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoon olive oil
32 cherry tomatoes, quartered
2 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped or
1 teaspoon dried basil
2 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped or
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
1 salt and pepper
      ----HERBED CREAM FILLING----
1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon fresh chives, chopped
1 salt and pepper
20  prawns, cooked, shelled and
1  deveined
1 deep-fried thin strips of
1  carrot, zucchini, leek,
1 & eggplant for garnish

Leek Molds: Lightly oil 4 individual 1 cup souffle dishes, about 4" in
diameter and 2" deep. Linewith clear plastic wrap, smoothing out
wrinkles as much as possible and leaving ends extended over tops of
dishes.

Trim off leek tops so leeks are about 5" long. Blanch leeks in large
pot of boiling water 2 to 3 minutes until leeks are tender but still
retain their shape. Plunge into ice water.

Cut bottom portions of leeks in lengths the same height as the souffle
dishes, about 2". Stand leek pieces on end around inside edge of each
souffle forming a leek "shell," with white portions of leeks toward
bottom of dish. Set aside.

Tomato Gelatin: Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in small saucepan to
soften. Puree 16 cherry tomatoes in food processor. Sieve to remove
seeds and skins. Add tomato puree to gelatin mixture. Stir over
medium heat until gelatin dissolves and mixture almost boils.

Reserve half the gelatin mixture at room temperature. Divide remaining
gelatin mixture among the 4 souffle dishes. Cover and refrigerate
until set, about 1 hour.

Tomato Confit: While molds are setting, in large skillet, saute
chopped onion in hot olive oil over medium high heat until soft.

Add quartered cherry tomatoes. Cook, stirring constantly, until
tomatoes are very soft and form a saucelike consistency. Remove from
heat. Stir in basil, thyme, white vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste.

Pour into bowl, and refrigerate to cool.

Herbed Cream Filling: In small bowl, combine sour cream, chives, salt
and pepper to taste.

Assembly: Reserve half the tomato confit. Spoon remaining confit over
set gelatin in souffle dishes.

Top with a spoonful of cream filling in center, then cover with
remaining tomato confit.

Carefully spoon a layer of the remaining gelatin mixture atop each
souffle.

Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours until set.

To Serve: Gently loosen plastic wrap from sides of souffle with a
knife. Lift gelatin molds out of souffles using extended ends of
plastic wrap as "handles." Peel plastic wrap from sides.

Lift molds off plastic wrap with a spatula and center each mold on a
serving plate.

Garnish each with 5 prawns and deep-fried vegetables, if desired.

Bacalao Espanol (Spanish Cod)

mexican, seafood

1 lb salted codfish
2 1/2 tablespoon parsley,
1 large onion, minced well chopped
8 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoon dry sherry
2 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped
4 teaspoon green olives, chopped
1 clove of garlic, minced
1 salt and pepper to taste
1 small (4-ounce) can pimientos, shredded
1/4 teaspoon oregano

This came from one of the other cookbooks I picked up last weekend.
Nice segue, eh?

Inherited from Spain, this codfish dish is a favorite of the
Mexicans. Soak codfish for 8 hours in enough cold water to cover it.
Drain and shred the fish. Saute the onion in the oil until it is
softened. Add codfish and saute a few more minutes.  Add the
remaining ingredients. Simmer slowly until codfish is tender, about
1/2 hour or more.

Makes 4 servings.

Bakaliaro Tiganito (Fried Salt-Cod)

fish, greek

1 1/2 lb dried salt cod
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cold water
1 pinch salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 vegetable oil for frying

Cut the cod into 4-inch sections.  Place in a glass or earthenware
bowl, cover with cold water, and soak overnight. The next day, drain
and discard the water. Put the cod in a pot and cover with cold
water. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and lift out the
cod with a slotted spoon. Remove the bones and the black skin.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, water, salt, and baking powder
to make a thin batter.  Dip the cod in batter and fry in hot oil
(about 1/2 inch deep) on both sides, then lower heat and cook until
tender, turning once again.  Serve hot, with skordalia, which is cold
or room temperature.

Note: If the cod is excessively salty, change water 2 or 3 times
during the soaking period.

Cholesterol  per serving: 680

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Combine the skim milk, egg white and
pepper to make a seasoned egg wash.

Dip the fillets into the egg wash, then dredge them in the bread
crumbs. [Let sit for 10 minutes.]

Lay the fillets on a nonstick baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.

NOTE:  For me this dish is a marvelous replacement for fried fish.

Sauce:  Combine all ingredients and refrigerate in a tightly covered
container.

NOTES:  This sauce will keep for a week if stored as suggested. Use
this as you would regular tartar sauce with any dish. Try it as a
replacement for mayonnaise on sandwiches and in salads.

Baked Fish Cake

diabetic, fish, vegetables

1 1/2 lb potatoes; peeled
1 lb white fish fillet
1  salt; (to taste)
1 grd white or black pepper; freshly
2 tablespoon butter
4 tablespoon milk
1 grated peel of 1/2 lemon
2 tablespoon parsly; fresh chopped
1 teaspoon anchovy extract(optional)
3 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon oil

Cut the potatoes into chunks and place then in a saucepan with enough
water to cover, adding a little salt if liked. Heat until just about
to boil. Meanwhile, lay the fish on a plate or dish to cover the
saucepan and cover it with a second plate, lid or foil. Put the fish
on the pan when the water is boiling, then reduce the heat so water
does not froth over. Cook the potatoes until tender-10-15 minutes if
the chucks are faily small. Set the aside, without uncovering it.
Drain and mash the potatoes, beating the well until smooth.  Mix in
the butter, milk, lemon peel, parsley and anchovy extract, is used
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a quicke dish or baking pan. Pour
any cooking juices from the fish into the potato mixture. Flake the
flash off the skin, discarded any bones, and at it to the potatoes.
Mix well, adding seasoning to taste. Use a large spoon to place the
fish mixture in a mound on the prepared dish or pan but do not
flatten it until it is all in mounded up. Flatten the top of the
mixture sightly, then sprinkle it with a little of the flour.  Use a
spatula and slice to flatten the mixture into a little neat circle,
about 7" across. Pat the sides with the knife and the top with slice
to that the mixture is even and neatly shaped, keep sprinkling with
the flour to coat the outside evenly. Trickle the oil over the fish
cake and bake it for about 30 minutes, until well browned. Cut into
wedges to serve.

1 clove garlic -- minced
1 small onion -- finely chopped
1/2 lb scallops -- chopped
1  salt
1 fresh ground black pepper
1 dry white wine
1 dry bread crumbs -- fine

1/4 cup butter -- melted
1/2 cup hot water
1 white sauce:
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon flour

In a 10 inch skillet, melt the 1/2 cup of butter.  Add garlic and
onion and saute until onions are translucent. Add scallops and cook 2
or 3 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and white wine to taste. Add
sufficient bread crumbs to prepare a moist stuffing. Place each
flounder fillet dark-side-up on a flat surface. Placing the scallop
stuffing in the center of each fillet, divide evenly among the
fillets. Fold both ends of each fillet over the stuffing, overlapping
the ends. Pour the melted butter and the hot water into a 9x12 inch
baking dish. Transfer the stuffed fillets to the baking dish and bake
20 minutes while you prepare a white sauce. WHITE SAUCE:  In a small
saucepan, melt butter, then whisk in flour. Cook over low heat 2-3
minutes, whisking constantly. Then add milk, and salt, pepper, and
white wine to taste.  Increase heat to medium, whisking constantly
until the sauce is thickened. Cook several minutes over low heat,
stirring. When the flounder has baked 20 minutes, pour the white
sauce over the stuffed fillets.  Return the baking dish to the oven
briefly and heat until the sauce begins to bubble. -From Diana Rattray

Baked Salmon In Foil

fish

3 1/2 lb salmon
1  lemon
1 salt and pepper
1 tablespoon oil or softened butter

Lay a piece of silver foil, large enough to wrap the salmon in a very
loose parcel, on a baking tray. If the salmon is to be served hot,
grease the foil with the butter, or use the oil if serving the salmon
cold. Thinly slice the lemon and put about half on the foil. Put the
salmon on top, with a few slices of lemon inside and lay the rest of
the lemon along the top of the salmon. Season generously and wrap
loosely, making sure the edges are securely folded together so that
no steam can escape. Put into a medium oven, Gas Mk 4,350F,180C, for
10 minutes per pound. If serving hot, take it out of the oven and let
it stand for a further 10 minutes. If serving cold, leave the salmon
in the foil for two to three hours. To serve: Unwrap the fish and
gently pull off the skin.

Baked Stuffed Fish

main dish, seafood

1 white fish; enough for 4-6 servings
2 cup soft bread cubes; about 1/2 cubes
1 small onion; chopped fine
1 green pepper; blanched and chopped
8 oz imitation crabmeat
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup hellmans mayo
1 salt & pepper to taste

Mix all these ingredients together and roll up in fish fillets,
securing them with toothpicks. Divide it among four or five
good-sized pieces. Bake at 400 for 30 minutes. During last 10 minutes
pour newburg sauce over fish.
It's good with flounder, but any white fish will do. I've used large
cod and catfish fillets and butterflied them. Just enough so you can
roll it up over the stuffing.

BAKED STUFFED LAKE TROUT~ SALMON~ OR WALLEYED

seafood

1 teaspoon salt
1  carrot, thinly sliced
1 white pepper
1 rib celery, thinly sliced
6 lb fish, dressed
3/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 stuffing recipe
1 bay leaf
1 1/2 cup white wine
1  lemon, sliced very thin
4 tablespoon butter, melted
2  shallots, thinly sliced
      ----CELERY STUFFING----
3/4 cup (4 ribs) 
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 chopped celery
1 salt and fresh black pepper
1/2 chopped onions
1/4 teaspoon savory
4 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup chopped celery tops
      ----FENNEL / TARRAGON STUFFING----
2 tablespoon chopped parsley
1/2 teaspoon fennel seed
2 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
1 salt and fresh pepper
6 tablespoon butter, melted
1 1/2 cup roughly torn fresh
1 bread crumbs

Marjoram goes well with fish, and here's a recipe that uses it both
in and on the fish.  Neither lake trout nor salmon need be scaled,
but do scale the pike.  A whole baked fish on a garnished platter
always looks good to guests. Salt and pepper the fish inside and out,
then stuff it and sew up or skewer the opening.
Place in a buttered pan and lay lemon slices along its length.
Stick a toothpick in each slice.
Add the vegetables, marjoram, bay leaf, and white wine and bake,
uncovered, for about 35 minutes in a 400 degree oven, basting first
with the melted butter and then with the liquid in the pan. CELERY
STUFFING Saute the chopped celery and onions in butter in a small
skillet for 15 minutes, until tender but still with a little bite.
Add the chopped celery tops and the bread crumbs. Season to taste
with salt, pepper, and savory.  Makes 1 cup. FENNEL SEED AND TARRAGON

Baked Stuffed Squid

greek, seafood

1 karen mintzias
1 lb squid
1  salt
6 tablespoon olive oil
1  onion; chopped
1/3 cup raw long-grain white rice
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
2 tablespoon white wine
1/4 cup pine nuts
1/4 cup black raisins
1 freshly ground pepper
4 peeled tomatoes; drained
1/3 cup white wine

Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs from the heads and
tentacles, removing and discarding the translucent cartilage, and
small sand bag and ink. Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them
inside and out with cold water.  Heads and tentacles should be rinsed
thoroughly and cooked along with the sacs after you stuff the latter.
Drain and set aside.

Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a heavy frying pan, then add the onion and
cook, without browning, until transparent. Stir in the rice and saute
a few minutes, until golden.  Blend in the parsley, mint, 2
tablespoons wine, pine nuts, and raisins, and season with salt and
pepper to taste. Add enough water to half cover and cook for a few
minutes, then stuff the squid sacs with the mixture using a very
small spoon and allowing enough liquid in each for the rice to cook.
Seal opening with skewers or toothpicks. Place the stuffed sacs with
the heads and tentacles in a baking-serving dish.  Sprinkle with salt
and pepper and set aside.

Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes, 1/3 cup wine, and a little salt and
pepper in a small saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour the sauce
over the squid and dribble the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over

Baked Trout With Yoghurt & Herbs

seafood

6  6 -8 oz trouts
7 1/2 fl oz greek strained yoghurt
2 1/2 fl oz whipping cream
2 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley
2 tablespoon chopped chives
2 tablespoon chopped fennel
1 teaspoon fresh chopped thyme
1 teaspoon fresh chopped oregano
1 teaspoon fresh chopped tarragon
1 clarified or unsalted butter

Choose a baking dish or other shallow oven-proof dish suitable for
bringing to table, which is just large enough to take the trout in a
single layer when they are arranged head to tail. Thoroughly dry the
fish with plenty of kitchen paper.  Make a frying pan very hot,
barely smear it with fat and fry the fish briefly, one or two at a
time, just long enough to brown their skins well on both sides.
Transfer the fish to the ovenproof dish, arranging them neatly. Cover
and store in a cool place.

Chop the herbs and mix them gently in a small saucepan. Measure the
yoghurt and cream and pour them over the herbs. Add plenty of pepper
and some salt and stir to mix well.  Cover and leave to infuse.
Everything up to this stage can be done in advance, but be sure to
bring both the pan of sauce and the dish of trout back to room
temperature about 1 hour before they are to be put back into the oven
for cooking. (Foods that are transferred straight from the fridge to
cooker take a very long time to heat through properly.)

About 1/2 hour before you plan to serve the trout, bring the
yoghurt-and- herb mixture very slowly to simmering point, stirring
all the while. Pour the aromatic mixture over the fish, cover the
dish and bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for 20-25 minutes until the
fish are piping hot and cooked through.  (To check a trout for
readiness, insert the tip of a knife into its flesh just behind the
head.)  Serve with steamed new potatoes and other young summer
vegetables such as carrots and peas.

Barbecue Fish Sauce

bbq

1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup onion -- chopped
3/4 cup catsup
3/4 cup water
1/3 cup lemon juice
3 tablespoon sugar
3 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoon prepared mustard
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Saute onion in oil in medium heavy saucepan over medium-high heat
until tender. Combine with all ingredients and simmer 10 - 15 mins.

Using any mild fish, fileted or whole, place fish in wire basket that
will hold fish firmly in place or put a wire mesh on your grill.
Brush fish with seafood sauce occasionally until fish is flaky.

This sauce is also excellent on shrimp.

Oh, and if you're not happy with the freshness of your fish, soak it
in milk for a few hours. It takes the "fishy" smell out of the fish.

Barbecued Salmon With Field Greens

fish, main dish

      ----FOR THE BARBECUE RUB----
2 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
3 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 tablespoon paprika
6 salmon fillets, 5 oz each
1 olive oil for the salmon
      ----FOR THE VINAIGRETTE----
1 lb organic field greens
1 1/2 cup v8 or other vegetable juice
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup chopped tomato
1 1/2 tablespoon barbecue rub (reserved from above)
4 tablespoon olive oil

From Will Greenwood, not-quite White House chef.

For the rub: Combine the chili, garlic and onion powders, the sugar,
salt, allspice, cumin, white pepper and paprika in a food processor
until thoroughly mixed. Sprinkle all but 1 1/2 tablespoons of the rub
on all sides of the salmon. Let fillets marinate for 6 hours.

To cook the salmon: Prepare a very hot grill. If you are using wood
chips on the hot coals, first soak these in water so they will smoke
more. Add soaked chips 5 minutes before starting the salmon.

Rub the fillets with a thin film of olive oil. Grill them
approximately 8-10 minutes, depending on thickness.

For the field greens and vinaigrette: Clean and refresh the greens in
cold water. Spin dry. Mix the vegetable juice, vinegar and tomato
together with the reserved barbecue rub and olive oil. Toss with the
greens.

To serve: Divide greens among plates. Top each plate with a salmon
fillet. Spoon the remaining vinaigrette in the bowl over the salmon.
Serve hot.

No country of origin, but I'm betting on Vietnam this time, mainly
from the dip.

Coconut milk is easily made if you have a blender or food processor.

Boil 1 1/2 cups water.  Pour it over 1 1/2 cups of fresh or dry grated
coconut.  Beat it in the food processor or blender for at least 1
minute. Strain it through a sieve or through cheesecloth. Marinate
the squid for 1 hour in coconut milk to which you have added the
garlic. Prepare the coals and skewer the squid.

To make the dipping sauce which makes this dish so distinctive,
combine the fish sauce, peanuts, sugar, lime juice and the cayenne.

Grill the squid for about 3 minutes on one side.  When brown, turn
over and barbecue 3 minutes more.

Serve accompanied by the dipping sauce.

This recipe will produce tasty grilled fish if you use firm varieties
such as swordfish, sea bass or halibut, cutting the steaks or fillets
into large squares.

This dish serves 4 to 6 as part of a larger meal.

Bar-B-Q Secret Thai Shrimp

bbq, canadian, main dish, seafood, thai

2 3/16 lb black tiger shrimp, shell on
1 spicy thai dressing

Commercial Thai Sauce preparations are available such as "President's
Choice - Spicy Thai Dressing" (in Canada). In a stainless steel or
ceramic bowl, marinate the Shell-on Black Tiger Shrimp (rinsed if
defrosted) for 1-1/2 to 2 hours in sufficient Thai sauce to cover. Do
not marinate longer or shrimp will start to cook in the marinate and
take on a rubbery texture. Barbecue shrimp in shells over hot coals
3-4 minutes each side. The shells keep the meat moist. Serve
immediately with a suitable dipping sauce.

glossy red-brown skin.

Clean and peel 12 large Jerusalem artichokes. Put a little olive oil
in a roasting pan, add the artichokes and roast in a medium oven
until golden, a little caramelized and cooked through - about 20
minutes. Peel and slice 12 cloves of true shallots. Brush 28 scallops
lightly with oil on both sides. Have ready 4 kaffir lime leaves (or
substitute zest from the limes). Wash 8 wing beans (or substitute 4
very small bok choys about 10 cms tall - halve them lengthwise) and
blanch in boiling water.

Put the blanched vegetables in 4 large bowls (pasta bowls or similar),
together with the whole roasted artichokes, and scatter the sliced
shallots over the top. Meanwhile, in a saucepan com- bine 600 mL fish
stock, the juice of 3 limes, Thai fish sauce to taste (about 2
tablespoons) and pepper to taste and bring to the boil.

Heat an iron grill or heavy frying pan to a very high heat. Do not
grease. Throw in the oiled scallops and sear them very quickly on
both sides, so that they take colour on the outside but are barely
warm inside. Divide the scallops between the soup bowls, top with the
lime leaves and pour in the broth. Serve.

Beer Batter Halibut

fish

1 cup flour one 12-ounce bottle of beer
1 tablespoon of paprika and 1 1/2 tsp salt

For this batter, good quality, light-colored beers work best. The
flavor of dark beers is too strong.

Cut halibut into 1-inch-thick chunks. Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer to
375 degrees F. Make batter by combining remaining ingredients. Dip
the halibut into the batter and drop the pieces into the hot oil a
few at a time. Cook the fish chunks until the batter is golden brown
~ just a few minutes. Halibut overcooks easily, so try not to overdo
it. Remove the fish pieces from the oil and drain on paper towels;
serve piping hot with your favorite accompaniments.

a boil over high heat. Let boil for 10 minutes. Add the crabs, (if
blue crabs are not available, substitute other small to medium
crabs), cover, and return to boil.  Once steam starts to escape from
under the cover, let cook for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let
sit, covered, for 10 minutes more. From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home
Cooking" Published by Randon House Alex says, "Serves 2 Cajuns, 4
elsewhere." He writes, "We like to lay out the crabs and vegetables
on a large table covered with lots of paper and have a feast."

1 small celery knob
1 teaspoon salt
2 each bay leaves
5 each peppercorns, black
1 tablespoon butter, unsalted
1 tablespoon flour, all-purpose
1 pinch paprika
1/2 lb fish fillet; small pieces
1 each fish head
1 lb spawn (fish roe)
2 tablespoon vinegar, wine, white
1/4 cup sour cream

Peel vegetables and cut into small pieces, and together with salt,
bay leaves and peppercorns cook them in 2 qts water till they are
almost soft.
Make a roux with butter and flour, cook for only a few minutes,
leaving it very light. Add paprika and whip 1/2 cup cold water into
the roux.
Pour roux into the vegetable mixture and bring again to a boil.
Reduce heat to a simmer.
Add fish pieces and fish head, and simmer soup for 10 minutes. Add
spawn and cook for another 5 minutes.
Pour in the vinegar; just before serving stir in the sour cream.
Adjust salt and vinegar to your taste.
Note: During Lent most Hungarians eat a lot of fish. There are
almost always little bits of fish meat, bones and heads left over and
that's when this soup would be a good beginning for a Lenten meal.

Boned Oysters

greek, seafood

1 karen mintzias
12  oysters, fresh or frozen
1 cup flour
1/2 cup oil
1 salt and pepper; to taste

Use only the large Asiatic oysters caught in the Indian Ocean, Black
Sea, or the Persian and Arabian gulfs.

Use the delicious white meat only.  Discard the round white bone
sometimes discovered inside the shell -- or give it to some Persian.
They seem to prefer these bones to gold; they call them "pearls".
****************************************************
****************

Drain oysters.  Roll in flour.  Heat oil until hot in a large frying
pan. Fry oysters on medium-high heat for 5 minutes turning over once.
Sprinkle with seasonings and serve.

Bourbon-Bacon Scallops *jb

low cal, main dish, shellfish

3 tablespoon minced green onions
2 tablespoon bourbon
2 tablespoon maple syrup
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon pepper
24 large sea scallops (about 1-1/2 pounds)
6 low-sodium bacon slices (4 ounces)
1 cooking spray

1. Combine first 6 ingredients in a bowl; stir well. Add scallops,
stirring gently to coat. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour,
stirring occasionally.

2. Remove scallops from bowl, reserving marinade. Cut each slice of
bacon into 4 pieces. Wrap 1 bacon piece around each scallop (bacon
might only wrap halfway around scallops if they are very large).
Thread scallops onto 4 (12-inch) skewers, leaving some space between
scallops so bacon will cook.

3. Place skewers on a broiler pan coated with cooking spray; broil 8
minutes or until bacon is crisp and scallops are done, basting
occasionally with reserved marinade (cooking time will vary greatly
with size of scallops).

Braised Pork & Fresh Oysters In Clay Pot

chinese, meats, seafood

1/2 lb boneless pork butt, cut in
1  1 1/2 cubes
8 medium fresh pacific oysters (or
1  10 oz. jar)
4 green onions
1 1/2 cup warm water
1 tablespoon brown bean sauce
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced
1 piece dried orange peel
2 tablespoon medium sherry
1 cornstarch paste
1/2 cup peanut oil
1 chinese parsley for garnish
      ----MARINADE----
1/4 cup medium sherry
2 teaspoon thin soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon 5-spice powder
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Marinating:  Combine marinade ingredients in bowl large enough to hold
pork, mixing well. Add pork, cover, and marinate at room temperature
for 1 hour.

Braising:  Drain pork, taking care to remove pieces of garlic. Heat
oil in wok until it begins to smoke. Fry pork cubes, a few at a time,
until brown and crusty. Do this quickly to sear meat without cooking
it through. Drain in Chinese strainer or on paper towel. Strain and
reserve cooking oil.

Clay Pot:  In cool clay pot, combine water, bean sauce, dark soy,
minced ginger, dried orange peel, and sherry. Bring to boil, then add
braised pork cubes. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer for 30
minutes. Meanwhile, wash and trim green onions, cut into 2" sections.
Drain oysters. When pork has simmered 30 minutes, add onions and
oysters. You can stop the dish before adding oysters and onion. Cover
and cook at medium heat for 15 minutes more. Turn up to boil, dribble
in cornstarch paste to make light gravy. Serve with garnish of
parsley.

cheese, seafood

2 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup unsalted butter
8 slice day-old bread, cubed
1/4 lb fontina cheese, grated
1/4 lb crabmeat, well picked,flaked
6 oz brie, very cold
1/4 lb cream cheese, softened
3 large eggs
1 1/4 cup milk
1/8 teaspoon freshly grd. white pepper
1/4 teaspoon mace
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper-or to taste

Butter a 2-qt baking dish with the 2 Tb. butter. Put half the bread
cubes into the baking dish. Add the Fontina cheese in one layer, then
the crab, and top with remaining bread cubes.

Trim the rind off the Brie. Cut the Brie into small cubes and dot the
entire top of the strata with the cheese cubes. Note: The colder the
Brie, the easier it will be to cut.

Prepare a custard by beating the cream cheese with the eggs in a food
processor or electric mixer until light and fluffy. Melt the remaining
butter. Beat in the milk, seasonings, and melted butter. Pour over the
strata. Press the strata down with the back of a spoon so all the
bread is moistened with the custard. Refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake strata for 1 hour, or until puffy
and golden brown. Let sit for 5 minutes.

Serve hot or warm.

Cajun Soft-Shell Crabs On Buns

seafood

4 medium soft-shell crabs, cleaned
1 cup skim milk
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
4 tablespoon low-fat butter
4  round sandwich buns or rolls, toast; ed
4 tablespoon cajun mayonnaise
2  scallions, thinly sliced

Soft-shell crabs are one of the great culinary joys of springtime.
They should be purchased fresh, and most fish markets are happy to
clean them for you. If not, the technique takes a little courage, but
once you get the knack, it's really quite easy: Rinse each crab under
cold water and, with scissors, snip off the head about 1/4" behind
the eyes. Turn the crab over on its back; lift and pull off the
triangular apron on the lower part of the shell. Flip the crab over
and pull back the points of the top shell. Remove and discard the
gills on both sides. Rinse the cleaned crab and pat dry.

1. Soak prepared crabs in milk for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bag,
combine flour, paprika, garlic powder and cayenne. Shake well;
reserve.

2. Remove the crabs from the milk and dredge in the seasoned flour.
Shake off any excess flour.

3. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute crabs,
two at a time, for 4-5 minutes per side, or until crispy and browned.
Remove to a paper towel to drain.

4. Spread each toasted bun with 1 tablespoon of Cajun Mayonnaise, or
more if desired. Sprinkle scallions on bottom half of bun, then top
with a crab. Cover with top half of the bun and serve immediately.

Calamari Farciti Con Ricotta E Spinaci

seafood

8 large squid
1 medium onion; minced
1  garlic clove; minced
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter, unsalted
1/2 lb spinach, fresh; trimmed
2/3 lb ricotta
1  egg
1 tablespoon parsley, italian; chopped
1  kosher salt; to taste
1  pepper, black; to taste
1/2 cup wine, white, dry
2 cup tomato, plum
1  lemon; quartered

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Clean the squid and chop the
tentacles finely.  Set them aside. Saut 82 the onion and the garlic
in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the butter until the onion is
soft. Add the tentacles and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the spinach and
saut E9, stirring, until it has wilted. Drain off any extra liquid
and cool the spinach. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, egg,
parsley, and the cooled spinach mixture. Mix thoroughly and season
with salt, pepper, and hot pepper flakes. Stuff the mixture loosely
into the squid and close the openings securely with a toothpick. Use
the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a rectangular baking
dish large enough to hold the squid comfortably in one layer. Arrange
the squid in the dish and add the wine and tomatoes. Season with
salt, pepper and more hot pepper flakes, if you wish. Bake for 40 to
45 minutes, or until the squid is tender and the sauce has thickened.
If there is too much sauce, raise the oven temperature and allow the
liquid to reduce.  If there is too little, add more white wine. Serve
the squid with lemon quarters. Do not overstuff the squid or they may
split while they cook.  Rice and braised fennel go well with this
dish.

Calamaria Gemista (Stuffed Squid)

greek, seafood

3 lb large fresh squid
1/2 cup olive oil
1 cup coarsely chopped onion (packed)
1/3 cup long-grain rice
1/4 cup pine nuts
2 large garlic cloves; chopped
1/4 cup currants
3/4 cup dry white or red wine
1  salt & freshly ground pepper to tas; te
3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (packed)
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill, packed
4 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
2 cup peeled, seeded tomatoes (chopped)

Wash and clean squid.  Grasp the head just below the eyes, pull it
off from the rest of the body, and set it aside. Cut away the thin
purplish membrane on the outside of the tail section. Using your
index finger, scoop out and discard the guts and thin cartilage
"icicle" on the inside of the tail section.  Rinse tail sections
inside and out and set aside in a colander to drain.  Take the head
section in one hand and put pressure with your thumb and forefinger
around the mouth and eyes, to squeeze them out. Discard mouth and
eyes.

Chop the squid tentacles and have them ready, as they will be used in
the stuffing.

In a large skillet, heat half the oilve oil and saute onion until
wilted. Add rice, tentacles, and pine nuts and saute over medium-low
heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and currants to rice and stir
quickly with a woodent spoon.  Pour in 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup
water. Season with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to low and simmer,
covered, until liquid is almost completely absorbed and rice is soft
but only about half cooked, about 15 minutes.  About 5 minutes before
removing skillet from heat, add parsley, dill and mint. Remove and
let cool enough to handle.

Using a small teaspoon or a butter knife, carefully fill about three
quarters of each squid with the rice mixture. Use toothpicks to secure
closed.  Pour remaining olive oil into a large stewing pot. Place
squid carefully in pot.  Pour in remaining wine and enough water to
cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered for
about 1-1/2 hours, or until rice is cooked and squid fork-tender.
Twenty minutes before removing squid from heat, add chopped tomatoes
to pot and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Check throughout
cooking to see if more water is necessary so that mixture doesn't dry
out.  Serve squid hot or cold with a simple green salad.

SERVING SUGGESTIONS: This dish needs a delicate wine such as a Robola
Callinga or Santorini Boutari.  Serve with wild greens (horta),
'horiatiki salata (village salad), and a beautiful olive bread.

Calamaria Parayemista

appetizers, ethnic, seafood

1 kg small squid
1/2 cup corn oil
1 medium onion; finely chopped
1/2 cup short-grain rice
1/2 cup tomato puree
1/4 cup water
1 small cinnamon stick
2  cloves
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup dry white wine

Servings:  6

Select squid with hoods about 10-12 cm (4-5 inches) long.

To clean squid, pull off head and attached tentacles. Cut out eyes
and beak and discard.  Clean dark skin from head and tentacles by
pulling it off or rubbing off with a cloth dipped in coarse salt.
Rinse, chop 3 to 4 into small pieces and keep aside.  Remainder may
be stored and fried later.

Clean out hood (body) and remove transparent backbone from inside.
Pull or rub off skin.  Rinse well, drain and dry.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan and gently fry onion until
transparent. Stir in rice and stir over heat for 2 minutes. Add
tomato puree, water, cinnamon stick, cloves, chopped squid, and salt
and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes or
until liquid is absorbed. Remove cinnamon stick and cloves.

Fill hoods with rice mixture, packing it in loosely as rice expands
and hoods contract during cooking.  Close top with wooden cocktail
picks or sew with strong thread.

Heat remaining oil in a deep pan and fry squid hoods until lightly
coloured, turning them frequently. Reduce heat, add wine, cover and
simmer gently on low heat for 1 hour or until squid is tender. Add a
little water to pan if necessary during cooking. Serve hot or warm as
a mezethaki (appetizer).

Cang Cua Boc Tom (Shrimp On Crab Legs)

seafood, vietnam, vietnamese

10  crab legs or several hard shell cra; bs
1  shrimp paste, prepared as for shrim; p on sugar cane
1/4 cup vegetable oil
      ----NUOC CHAM----
1  clove garlic
1/2  fresh hot red chili pepper or 2 dri; ed
2 teaspoon heaping, granulated sugar
1/8  fresh lime
2 tablespoon fish sauce (nuoc mam)
2 1/2 tablespoon water, more if necessary

Here we have a party dish that will bring out "oohs" and "ahs" from
your guests on sight - and a repeat performance on taste.

Crab claws, alone, are sometimes available in fish stores. If they
aren't, boil several hard shell crabs and use the claws; you can use
the bodies in many other dishes.

The crab claws in fish stores are already partially peeled and serve
not only as a handle but are edible as well. If you prepare your own
claws, peel the upper section around which you mold the shrimp paste.

Boil the crab legs or crabs for about 10 minutes, then drain and cool;
remove the claws from the crabs, if using, and reserve the bodies for
another purpose.

Have the shrimp paste ready; preheat the oven to 350F.

Pour the oil into a bowl.  Dip your fingers into the oil and pick up 2
tablespoons of the shrimp paste. Mold it into an oval around and
halfway down the crab claw, covering the part of the claw where it
was attached to the body; this will leave a claw tip extended to
serve as a handle. Place the claws on a baking sheet and bake in the
preheated oven for 30 minutes.

Serve with Nuoc Cham and watercress.

NOTE:  In Vietnam, this dish is always barbecued over charcoal. If
you wish to prepare it this way, cook for 10 minutes on each side.

Makes 10 servings.

NUOC CHAM:

This exciting sauce is almost always served at Vietnamese meals, just
a Westerners serve salt and pepper. It's base is nuoc mam (bottled
fish sauce). Freshly prepared, it is a constant delight, and so
addictive to Western palettes that it will appear with meals other
than Vietnamese. To best appreciate the results of its superb
blending qualities at the table, use it sparingly at first, gradually
adding more until the result is just right for your palate.

Peel the garlic.  Split the chili pepper down the center and remove
the seeds and membrane.  Cut into pieces and put into a mortar,
together with the garlic and sugar. Pound into a paste. Squeeze the
lime juice into the paste, then with a small knife remove the pulp
from the lime section and add it as well. Mash this mixture and add
the fish sauce and water.

NOTE:  If you find this a trifle strong at first, dilute it with an
additional 1/2 tablespoon of water.

Catalan Shredded Salt Cod Salad

fish

1 lb salt cod -- boneless, dried
1 small red or green bell pepper --
1  prepared
1/2 large red onion -- thinly sliced
1 large tomato -- thinly sliced
1/3 cup fruity spanish olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
4 large garlic cloves -- finely
1  chopped
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup oil cured black olives
3  hardboiled eggs --
1  quartered
1/2 small bunch oregano leaves- finely choppe; d

To prepare the salt cod, rinse it well and then immerse it in a
container of cold water (cut into chunks, if necessary, to fit).
Refrigerate, changing the soaking water 5 or 6 times, until softened
and mild (24 to 48 hours, depending on how stiff and salty it was to
begin with).

Drain the cod, place it in a large saucepan with the onion and the bay
leaves, and cover with cold water. Bring just to a boil, reduce the
heat to very low, and cover (taste the water at this stage and, if it
seems excessively salty, then drain, cover again with fresh cold
water, and bring to a boil). Simmer very gently until the fish is
opaque and plumped, and falls apart into heavy flakes when prodded,
about 20 minutes. Drain, pat dry, and remove the bones and skin, if
necessary. Separate into large flakes and use right away, or
refrigerate for up to 2 days before continuing with the recipe.

Drain and press the cod with your fingers to extract as much water as
possible. Shred the cod by hand into thin strips and transfer it to a
large bowl.

Core, seed and wash the pepper.  Cut into thin rings. Separate rings
of onion. Select 1 large, firm, ripe tomato and slice it thinly.

Add the pepper rings, onion, and tomato to the bowl and toss together
gently. In another bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, garlic, pepper,
and if desired, a little salt (the salt cod is usually still quite
salty; taste it to determine if the vinaigrette needs any salt).
Whisk the vinaigrette together until thoroughly blended.

Using your hands, toss the salad with the vinaigrette until all the
ingredients are coated. Transfer the salad to a platter and garnish
the edges with olives and wedges of hardboiled egg. Scatter the
oregano over the dish.  Yields 6 servings

Catfish In Oyster Andouille Butter

main dish, seafood

6 each 5-8 oz catfish fillets
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup eggwash (1 egg, 1/2 cup
1  water, 1/2 cup milk)
1/2 cup unseasoned flour
1/4 cup julienned andouille sausage
1 teaspoon garlic
1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped green onions
24 each fresh shucked oysters
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1  salt and white pepper to
1  taste
4 slice cold butter

In a ten inch heavy bottom saute pan, heat oil over medium high heat.
Blend eggwash to ensure that egg, milk and water are well mixed. Dip
catfish fillets into eggwash and then into flour, coating evenly on
all sides. Saute fish, three fillets at a time, until golden brown,
approximately three to five minutes on each side. Once cooked, remove
and keep warm. In the same saute pan, add andouille, garlic,
mushrooms and green onions and saute until vegetables are wilted,
approximately three to five minutes. Add oysters and saute until
their edges are curly. Deglaze with white wine, add heavy whipping
cream and cook until sauce is slightly thickened. Season to taste
using salt and white pepper. Once sauce has thickened, swirl in
butter chips, two at a time, until all is incorporated. The butter
will finish the sauce to a nice sheen. Place two to three ounces of
oyster butter in the center of a serving plate and top with catfish
fillet. Garnish with four cooked oysters per serving.

Catfish In Red Curry Sauce

catfish, curry, fish, stove top

2 tablespoon red curry paste
4 tablespoon peanut oil
2 cup coconut milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
3 tablespoon fish sauce
2 lb dressed catfish cut in
1  steaks
1 tablespoon substitute italian basil
1  3 fresh hot chilies chopped

Heat the curry paste in oil, stirring for about 2 minutes over med
heat. Add 1/4 cup of coconut milk and the fish sauce and simmer
slowly for another 2 minutes. Add the salt, sugar and the rest of the
coconut milk. Bring to a boil and, as soon as the sauce boils, add
the fish. DO NOT STIR THE FISH UNTIL THE SAUCE RETURNS TO A BOIL.
Chai says that if you disturb the fish before the sauce boils it will
acquire a strong aroma. Simmer the fish until done, about 5 minutes.
Let the dish sit for at least 15 minutes (or even as long as
overnight in the refrigerator) so the curry flavor permeates the
fish. Reheat, without boiling, and just before serving add the basil
leaves and chilies. Serve over rice.

RED CURRY PASTE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 5 dried red chilies, seeded, soaked
in warm water and drained salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 2
tsp ground caraway seeds 2 tsp ground coriander seeds 1 tsp coriander

O'Brien's, 3011 N. St. Mary's, San Antonio, Tx NOTE: Ceviche, or
Seviche, comes originally from Polynesia and has undergone changes
that make it a Mexican dish. Mexicans perfer to use fat fish as
mackerel or pompano for ceviche. Limes are preferred, although lemons
may be used, since both contain the citric acid that "cooks" the
fish. (According to Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz, The Complete Book of

Cha Gio (Spring Rolls)

appetizers, ham/pork, seafood, vietnam, vietnamese

2 oz cellophane noodles, soaked i n warm; water for 20 mi
1 lb ground pork
1  large onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoon tree ears, soaked in warm wa ter fo; r 30 minutes, th
3  cloves garlic, finely choppe d
3  shallots or white part of 3 scallio; ns, finely chop
1 cup crab meat; cartilage remove d and me
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
20  sheets dried rice papers (ba nh tra; ng)
4  eggs; well beaten
2 cup oil, peanut

Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside. Cut a round
rice paper sheet into quarters. Place the cut rice paper on a flat
surface. With a pastry brush, paint beaten egg over the entire
surface of each of the pieces. Before filling, wait for egg mixture
to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes about 2 minutes.
When you become adept at this, you can work on several wrappers at a
time. When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 tsp.
of filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle. Fold
the sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll. After
filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying  pan, put
the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate, and
fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown. (This is
Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).

2 oz ham; chopped
2  jalapeno peppers; stemmed and diced

1  lemon; juiced
1/3 cup olive oil
2 tablespoon fresh basil; chopped
24 oz salmon steaks

Combine in a large saucepan the beans, onion, carrot, celery, ham,
jalapenos, whole clove garlic, bay leaf with thyme, and water. Simmer
until beans are tender, about 2 hours, adding more water as necessary
to keep the beans covered. Remove the carrot, celery, herbs and
garlic, and drain off the remaining cooking liquid. Toss the beans
with the minced garlic, hot pepper flakes and the juice of 1/2 a
lemon. Set aside.

While the beans are cooking, combine the juice of a whole lemon,
olive oil, and basil leaves. Pour over the salmon steaks, and
refrigerate for 1 hour. Grill the salmon over a moderately high flame
for 4-5 minutes per side, basting with some of the marinade every

Charcoal Grilled Salmon With Spicy Black Beans

seafood

1/2 lb black beans; soaked
1 small onion; chopped
1 small carrot
1/2  celery rib
2 oz ham; chopped
2  jalapeno peppers; stemmed and diced
1  clove garlic
1  bay leaf; tied together with
3  sprigs thyme
5 cup water
2  cloves garlic; minced
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper flakes
1/2  lemon; juiced
1  lemon; juiced
1/3 cup olive oil
2 tablespoon fresh basil; chopped
24 oz salmon steaks

Combine in a large saucepan the beans, onion, carrot, celery, ham,
jalapenos, whole clove garlic, bay leaf with thyme, and water. Simmer
until beans are tender, about 2 hours, adding more water as necessary
to keep the beans covered. Remove the carrot, celery, herbs and
garlic, and drain off the remaining cooking liquid. Toss the beans
with the minced garlic, hot pepper flakes and the juice of 1/2 a
lemon. Set aside.

While the beans are cooking, combine the juice of a whole lemon,
olive oil, and basil leaves. Pour over the salmon steaks, and
refrigerate for 1 hour. Grill the salmon over a moderately high flame
for 4-5 minutes per side, basting with some of the marinade every
minute. Serve each steak with a portion of beans.

Chard-Wrapped Salmon & Duxelles

fish, main dish

1/3 lb mushrooms; commercial, wild, or a mi
2 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup onion; finely diced
1  clove garlic; minced
1 pinch dried savory; crumbled
1 pinch pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon dry sherry or madeira
12 oz salmon fillets; cross-cut
4 large swiss chard leaves; stemmed, blanched, rinsed
1/2 cup brown veal or poultry stock
1 oz dry white wine

Finely dice the mushrooms (if using wild mushrooms with an interesting
shape, cut them into long strips or wedges.) Melt 1 tb of the butter
in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms
and onion and cook, shaking or stirring, until the mushrooms begin to
wilt. Add the garlic, savory, pepper, and 1/8 ts salt. Cook until the
liquid given off by the mushrooms is nearly gone, then add the sherry
and cook until evaporated. Remove from heat, taste for seasoning, and
set aside to cool.

Remove any pin bones from the salmon fillets and season lightly with
remaining salt and pepper. Lay out 2 chard leaves in opposite
directions, slightly overlapping. Place a salmon fillet across the
middle, skin side up (if the belly flap is especially long or thin,
fold it double for a more compact, even shape.) Arrange 1/4 of the
mushrooms mixture on each side of the salmon. Fold the near end of
the leaves over the fish, tuck in the sides, then fold the whole
thing over the remaining leaf, forming an envelope. Trim off the
remainder of the leaf to form a neat package. Repeat with the
remaining salmon fillet.

Heat the stock and wine to a simmer in the same skillet used for the
mushrooms. Place the salmon packages in the pan, seam side down,
cover, and cook at a simmer until a skewer easily enters the center
of the fish, 8-12 minutes depending on the thickness.

Transfer the fish to plates, turn the heat under the skillet to high,
and reduce the stock slightly. Swirl in the remaining butter, taste
for seasoning, and pour over the fish.

Charlene Prickett's Crab Salad With Yogurt Dr

fish, salads

      ----YOGURT DRESSING----
1 cup low-fat yogurt
1 tablespoon chives or spring onions
1  garlic clove,crushed
2 teaspoon lemon juice
1  vegetable salt
      ----CRAB SALAD----
1  butter lettuce head
2 lb crab meat
1 lb mandarin oranges,seedless
1 lb fresh peaches,peeled/sliced
4  shallots,minced
2  large cucumbers,sliced
1/2 lb snow peas
1  juice of lemon
      ----GARNISH----
1  lemon slices
1  fresh chives

Charlene Prickett combines brain with brawn on IT FIGURES, her
long-running exercise show for Lifetime Television. "I have a real
academic streak," says Prickett. "I have a lot of interest in science
and in keeping up with the research that's always changing. Every
year I go to fitness conferences and sports-medicine clinics
throughout the country, and I always like to share what I've learned
by including an information element in my shows." So what does the
latest research say about the most effective way to get a good
workout? Says Prickett, "In terms of being optimally effective,
cross-training - weight training, along with some stretching and
aerobic activity - has come to be thought of as important. The
advantage is that you don't stress the body in the same way every
single day, and it prevents injury as well as boredom."

Prickett also believes that women have to work harder than men at
battling the bulge. "When you're young or if you're a man, the
likelihood of your staying near ideal weight with exercise alone is
good. However, if you're female or over 25, it generally takes both
regular exercise AND good food choices. That doesn't mean you can
never have an ice-cream sundae, but to stay at or near ideal weight,
you need to make discriminating food choices."

For dressing: mix all ingredients and chill.

For salad: mix all ingredients except lettuce in a bowl, add
dressing, and chill for 1 hour. Arrange lettuce leaves in a salad
bowl, add salad.

Garnish with lemon slices and chives.

Chesapeake Bay Crab Cakes

appetizers, seafood

1 teaspoon sharp prepared mustard
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
6 tablespoon olive oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 lb lump crabmeat, picked clean
1/2 cup dry, unflavored bread crumbs
1 pinch of cayenne pepper
4 tablespoon butter

Chesapeake Bay Crab Cakes

Parsley, lemon wedges, tartar sauce as desired

Using an electric blender or wire whisk, beat together mustard, lemon
juice and egg until thoroughly combined. While beating vigorously,
gradually pour 4 Tbs of olive oil into the egg mixture in a thin
stream. When smooth and creamy, stir in salt and pepper.

Gently fold in crabmeat, then bread crumbs and cayenne pepper. Shape
into 8 patties, each about a half-inch thick. They will want to fall
apart, but that's the idea of a good crab cake. You want only enough
non-crab stuff to just barely bind them.

Melt  butter together with 2 Tbs of olive oil in skillet over medium
heat. When butter sizzles (but before it burns!) gently ease the crab
cakes into the skillet to cook. When well browned (2 to 3 minutes),
gently turn and cook  other  side. Drain on paper towels. Serve
immediately.

Makes 4 main-course servings, 8 appetizers

Chesapeake Restaurant Crab Cakes

seafood

1 lb lump crabmeat, cooked
1 each egg, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup parsley, chopped
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
1 cup bread crumbs
6 tablespoon butter

I personally like to add 1 ts of Old Bay seasoning to this and cut
back a little on the salt.

Trying to preserve whole pieces of crabmeat, combine first 8
ingredients in medium bowl. Using 1/3 - 1/2 cup for each cake, shape
mixture into 6 cakes. Gently coat cakes with breadcrumbs; place cakes
on plate and refrigerate 2 hours. Melt butter in 10" skillet. Brown
crab cakes in butter until golden on both sides and heated through.
Cakes will keep in refrigerator 3-4 days and in the freezer 2 months.
To reheat, wrap in foil and warm in preheated 325 degree oven for 10
minutes or refry in a skillet with a little butter.

Chili Shrimp With Basil

appetizers, chinese, seafood

1  karen mintzias
1 lb raw medium shrimp
1  salt
1/2  sweet red pepper
8  chives
2 tablespoon unsalted roasted peanuts
      ----SAUCE----
2 tablespoon fish sauce
2 tablespoon lime juice
2 tablespoon water
2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon chinese chili sauce
2  garlic cloves  finely minced
2 tablespoon chopped fresh basil

ADVANCE PREPARATION: Shell the shrimp, then devein by cutting along
the top of the curve, starting at the tail and making a progressively
deeper cut so the knife nearly cuts through the shrimp at the thick
end. Rinse out the vein.  Bring a large amount of lightly salted
water to a rapid boil and add the shrimp.  Cook until shrimp are
done, between 1 and 2 minutes. To test, cut a shrimp in half; it
should be white in the center. Transfer the shrimp immediately to a
bowl of ice water to cool. When chilled, drain and refrigerate until
ready to use.

Mince and place in separate containers the red pepper and chives.
Finely chop the peanuts in a food processor and set aside. Combine
the sauce ingredients and mix well.

LAST-MINUTE PREPARATION:  Toss the shrimp with the sauce. Put in a
decorative bowl and place the bowl in crushed ice. Sprinkle the
shrimp with the red pepper, chives and peanuts. Serve at once.

Serves: 4 to 8 as an appetizer or 4 as a first course.

Chilled Trout In Dill Sauce

fish

4  whole cleaned trout
1  (each about 1/2 lb.)
1  basic poaching liquid
1  parsley sprigs
1  lemon wedges
1 cup sour cream
4 teaspoon lemon juice
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dillweed
      ----BASIC POACHING LIQUID----
1 medium onion (sliced)
6  whole black peppers
2  whole allspice
3 tablespoon lemon juice or white wine
1  vinegar
1  bay leaf
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dry white wine (or water)
1 quart water

About 3-4 hours before you intend to serve, poach trout in basic
poaching liquid (recipe and directions follow). When done, transfer
to a serving platter and let cool; then cover and chill.
About 10 minutes before serving time, remove cover from fish and,
holding fish in place with wide spatula, drain off and discard any
juices that might have collected on platter. Wipe platter and garnish
with parsley sprigs and lemon wedges.
In a bowl, combine sour cream, lemon juice, salt and dill weed. Mix
thoroughly. Serve sauce in small serving bowl to spoon over fish.
Basic Poaching Liquid In a poaching pan or 3-quart pan, combine
onion, whole black peppers, whole allspice, lemon juice or white wine
vinegar, bay leaf, salt, dry white wine (or water), (you will need
just enough to cover fish pieces, so amount of water and wine may be
varied accordingly). Cover and simmer ingredients for at least 20
minutes.
Recipe may be doubled or tripled if larger amounts are needed (if so,
simmer ingredients for 30 minutes to 1 hour). Poaching liquid may be
reused several times - it will simply acquire more flavor, the more
often it is used.  However, liquid should not be stored in the
refrigerator longer than 2 days; freeze in an airtight container if
longer storage is necessary. How to Poach Bring poaching liquid to a
boil in poaching pan on top of the stove. Lower fish into simmering
liquid - there should be just enough liquid to cover fish; if not,
add equal parts water and dry white wine (or all water) just to cover
fish. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently (water should never be
allowed to boil).
Cook until fish flakes readily when prodded in thickest portion with
a fork - for a 1-inch thick piece of fish (measured in thickest
portion), allow 10 minutes from the moment simmering resumes after
fish has been added.  (Allow same ratio of thickness to time - 1
inch: 10 minutes - for fishes of all thicknesses.) When, done, lift
fish from liquid with a wide spatula, supporting it with cheesecloth
if necessary. Drain well; then open cheesecloth carefully and gently
remove it from fish.

Chinese Crab Rice

chinese, fish

1  stephen ceideburg
2  green onions, chopped
1  piece fresh ginger, 2-3 cm, grated
4 tablespoon dry sherry
3 tablespoon light soy sauce
3  blue crabs
400 gm glutinous rice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon oil
1 teaspoon sugar

The Chinese have comfort food, too, and this dish qualifies. You will
need a large steamer; if you don't yet have one, they can be bought
cheaply in large Chinese or Vietnamese food stores where you can also
pick up the glutinous rice. The dish takes considerably longer to
cook than the previous recipes but little more of the cook's time. By
the time the rice is cooked, it is saturated with crab flavour.

Finely chop 2 green (spring) onions and grate 2-3 cms of fresh ginger.
Combine them with 4 tablespoons dry sherry and 3 tablespoons light soy
sauce. Prepare three green blue swimmers crabs. Chop two of them into
several pieces with a large knife or cleaver and crack the hardest
pieces of the shell with a hammer. Crack the third crab thoroughly
all over but do not chop up. Pour the sherry-soy sauce mixture over
the crabs and leave to marinate for an hour. Wash 400 grams glutinous
rice in several changes of water until the water runs clear.

Put the rice into a saucepan and pour over it 1.5 L water. Bring to
the boil and boil for 5 minutes. Drain.

In the bottom of a heatproof dish at least 12 cm deep and of a size
to fit into your steamer, pack in the chopped crab pieces, reserving
the marinade. Pour the rice over the top and pack it down. Press the
intact crab into the top of the rice. To the marinade, add a further
tablespoon soy sauce and a tablespoon oil, teaspoon salt and 1
teaspoon sugar. Pour over the crabs and rice.

Put the dish in the steamer over boiling water and steam for 35-40
minutes. Serve. Diners deal first with the top crab, now half buried
in rice, then fish around, for the rest of the crab pieces in rice.

Chinese Popcorn (Sweet & Pungent Shrimp)

appetizers, main dish, oriental, seafood

1 lb raw shrimp
1/2  egg white; beaten
1 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt to
4 cup oil; for deep frying
1  green onions; for garnish
      ----SWEET AND PUNGENT SAUCE----
4 1/2 tablespoon sugar
4 1/2 tablespoon catsup
1/4 cup vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sherry
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon oil
2 large garlic cloves; minced
3/4 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon chopped green onion
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon orange zest

A reader who requested the recipe for a sweet and pungent shrimp from
the Panda Inn in Pasadena won the everlasting thanks of our tasting
panel. Because it's as impossible to eat just one of these as it is
to eat a single kernel of popcorn, the recipe is often called Chinese
popcorn.
__________________________________________________
_______________

Peel and devein the shrimp.  Slice in halves lengthwise. Rinse well
and pat dry.  Add the egg white to the shrimp and mix well. Mix
1-1/2tablespoons cornstarch with salt and add to shrimp. Stir to coat
well. Add 1-1/2 tablespoons oil and mix well again. Place the shrimp
in a bowl and refrigerate at least 2 hours.Remove the shrimp and dust
with remaining cornstarch.  Shrimp should be dry to the touch. Heat
the remaining oil in a large wok to 350 to 375 degrees. Fry the
shrimp 1-1/2 to 2 minutes until crisp, being careful to separate them
with a long- handled wooden spoon or chopsticks to prevent sticking.
It may be necessary to fry the shrimp in several batches.  When done,
remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain well.  Combine the
shrimp and the sweet and pungent sauce and toss quickly to coat.
Immediately turn out onto a platter and sprinkle with finely chopped
green onions. SWEET AND PUNGENT SAUCE: Combine the sugar, catsup,
vinegar, and salt, and set aside. Heat the oil in a wok. Add the
garlic, ginger, green onion, red pepper, and zests of lemon and
orange; cook 30 seconds.  Stir in the sugar-catsup mixture.
Immediately add the sherry mixture and cook until slightly thickened.

Chinese Steamed Cracked Crabs

chinese, seafood

1  crab, live in the shell, about 2 po; unds
2  green onions, bruised and cut in ha; lf
2 quart sized slices of ginger
1 tablespoon shao hsing wine or dry sherry
1  ginger, green onion and vinegar dip; ping sauce
4 tablespoon finely shredded green onion
2 tablespoon finely shredded ginger, preferably; young ginger
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoon vinegar
3 1/2 tablespoon peanut oil

It's crab season here in the San Francisco bay area. Heap and heaps of
luscious Dungeness crabs are showing up all over the place. Steamed or
live++take your pick! I was in Oakland's Chinatown last weekend
shopping at the Sam Yick gorcery and saw a couple of boxes of still-
kicking Blue crabs for a buck seventy-nine a pound. Good eatin' ahead!

Kill and clean the crab.  Place it, top shell down, on a heat-
resistant plate.  Scatter the onion, ginger and wine on top of the
crab. Put the crab and plate into a preheated steamer. steam over
high heat for 15 minutes. Remove and cool.

Disjoint and crack the crab and arrange on a platter. Dip the meat
into the dipping sauce and eat with green onions and ginger. Use the
tip of the leg to dig out the meat.

Serves 2 as a light meal.

GINGER, GREEN ONION and VINEGAR DIPPING SAUCE Scatter green onions in
a shallow saucer.  Top with the shredded ginger. Sprinkle sugar and
salt evenly over the ginger. Pour the vinegar over the ginger. Heat
the oil until it's hot but not smoking, and pour it over the mixture.
It should sizzle lightly.  If it is too hot, let it cool.

Makes about 2/3 cup.

Chinese Style Mushroom Filled With Salmon Fil

chinese, seafood, vegetables

1  salmon steak, fresh
      ----FILLING----
1  mushrooms, inoki, - julienne
1  carrot, julienne
1  mushroom, shitake, - julienne
1  celery, julienned
1  salt (to taste)
1  pepper (to taste)
1  oil, for frying
      ----BRAISING SAUCE----
1  lemon grass, white part - only, min; ced
2 tablespoon shallot, minced
2 tablespoon rice wine
2 tablespoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 tablespoon broth, chicken
1 teaspoon sugar
1  rice, cooked
1  cilantro (garnish)

Preparation: ============

First julienne the mushrooms and vegetables into thin, short
strips. Set aside.

Cut the salmon steak in half.  Take each half and slice it most of
the way through horizontally so the two pieces fold back on a hinge
like a hamburger or hot dog roll.

Prepare a braising glaze by mixing the "sauce" ingredients above
in a small bowl and stir and set aside.

Assembly: =========

Into each of the two salmon "sandwich" pieces, add a touch of salt
and pepper to taste and then add portions of Shitake, and Inoki
mushroom, celery and carrot as filling for the "sandwiches."

Close up the "sandwiches" and set aside.

To Cook: ========

In a small saute pan, heat a bit of peanut oil over high heat
until it begins to smoke and then put the salmon sandwiches in to
brown both sides (about 1 minute each side.)

When both sides are browned, add the braising sauce to the salmon.
Cover and braise over medium heat until the salmon is done ( 2 to 3
minutes).

Transfer the cooked salmon sandwiches to a serving plate and serve
with cakes of sticky rice and garnish with julienne fans of Szechuan
pickle.

Top with drippings from the saute pan, and pieces of Cilantro.

1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon msg (optional)
2  green onions, diced
1 teaspoon salt
1  peanut oil

Pan-fry the eggs into thin sheets in a frying pan. Remove and cut into
small strips.

Heat peanut oil over high heat.  Stir-fry shrimp and chicken. When
done, sizzle in 1 tsp. wine.

Add the cooked rice.  Stir until well-mixed.  Add 1 tbsp. soy sauce,
1/4 tsp. MSG and the diced green onion. Add 1 tsp. salt (or more).
Stir-frry for at least 10 minutes over MEDIUM heat. Add egg strips.

Serve hot.

Note: The cooked rice should not be sticky.  It might even be better
to use day-old rice.  If you must use freshly cooked rice, you may
spread the rice on a cookie sheet and let cool completely before you
stir-fry it.

Chinese: Steamed Pork Dumplings (Shiu Mai)

chinese, dumplings, pork, seafood, side dish

1 pkg round dumpling skins *
1/2 lb prawns
12  chinese mushrooms, small or  use ca; nned but squeeze dry
1/2 lb ground pork
2  green onion, finely chopped
1 small egg
      ----SEASONING----
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon sesame oi
2 teaspoon thin soy sauce
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Shell, devein, wash, and drain prawns.  Dice into bits.

Boil mushrooms in water for 10 minutes, rinse, squeeze dry, cut off
and discard stems; then chop into very small pieces.

Combine the pork, mushrooms, prawns, and onion.  Put mixture on
chopping board and chop 10 to 15 strokes with cleaver. (Use a sharp
knife if you don't have a cleaver.) Texture, when you're finished,
should be slightly finer than hamburger.

Add "seasoning" and the egg to the pork mixture.  Mix well.

To make dumpling, place 1 Tb filling in the center of a dumpling
skin. Then bring all sides of the skin up to cover the meat as much
as possible, without closing. The top of the dumpling is left open.

Cook dumplings by steaming for 30 minutes.  Use as many as you need,
with the rest, cool, wrap, freeze. Reheat after thawing by steaming
10 minutes.

Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, or mustard.

*  Dumpling skins are similar to won ton skins, except that they are
round and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by
merely cutting off the corners to round off the skin.

Christmas Kedgeree

breakfast, fish, holidays

4 tablespoon butter
2 cup cooked rice
2 cup smoked yellowfish
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon curry powder
1  salt to taste
4  hard boiled eggs
3 tablespoon chopped parsley

CHRISTMAS EVE PREPERATION  (20 MINUTES) 1. Prepare hard boiled eggs.
Cook rice, fluff gently and refrigerate. 2. Prepare fish. You can use
any fish or shell fish but I use thick
slabs of smoked yellowfish, or thick slabs of smoked haddock. Thin
fillets tend to break up into pieces too small. Place fish in pan,
cover with water, and heat gently until just before boiling point.
Drain and refrigerate. Allowing fish to boil will turn it into
mush
during final cooking. CHRISTMAS MORNING PREPERATION (15 MINUTES)
1. In a microwave dish or double boiler, melt butter and heat cream
(reserving 3 T for moisture adjustment). Add cooked rice and mix
well. 2.  Gently break cold fish into bite size pieces and add to
mixture.
Chop hard boiled eggs and add to mixture. 3. Adjust moisture
before heating mixture. Microwave mixture should be
moist but not damp. If using doubleboiler to heat mixture, add
reserved
cream until mixture is slightly sloppy or it will dry out during
heating. 4. Heat mixture in microwave on high, stirring every
minute until hot.
Garnish with chopped parsley and serve.

1 can chopped or minced clams, drained
1 pint sour cream
1  salt
1  powdered garlic
1  cayenne pepper

Open can of olives.  Eat a handful, just to make sure. Eat a few
more. As long as you leave at least half the can, you've got enough.
Chop them up. Add the chopped olives to the rest of the ingredients,
stir, and chill for 2 hours before serving.

Quantities on the spices are left to you.

Btw, if you have never tried cream cheese and chopped olive
sandwiches, let me recommend them.  Soften a package of cream cheese,
add small can chopped olives and a teaspoon or so of lemon juice.
Stir well and spread. Gutsy eaters add turkey.

1 large onion chopped
2  ribs celery peeled and

5 small can minced clams or
1 large can (about 51-oz)
2 teaspoon seafood chesapeake brand
1  bay-style seafood
1  seasoning
1 quart (4 cup) half and half
1  divided
2 tablespoon flour

The day before you wish to serve the soup, fry the bacon until crisp
and remove. In bacon drippings, saute onion, celery with leaves and
potatoes for 10-15 minutes at medium heat. Add the minced clams, not
clam soup but clams, with their juice. Crumble the bacon and add.
Cover soup and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, for
several hours - up to five hours won't hurt. Cool down and place in
refrigerator at night. On the day of serving, skim grease off top.
Transfer soup to larger pot. Heat soup until bubbling and add the
seafood seasoning. Mix 2 cups of the half and half with the flour.
Add to the chowder and stir until it bubbles again. Mix in remaining
half and half and simmer, stirring constantly, until soup is desired
thickness. Serve hot with garlic bread and a green salad.

Clam Sauce White For Pasta

fish, pasta, sauces

24  littleneck clams, small
1/2 cup dry white wine
2  cloves garlic, minced
1  fresh ital. parsley, minced
2 tablespoon creme fraiche
1  olive oil
1 tablespoon flour
1  bay leaf
1/2 cup water
1  fresh chervil, minced
1 dash louisiana hot sauce
1/2 lb spaghetti or linguine
1  freshly ground black pepper
3  heated pasta plates/bowls

Soak clams in cold fresh water. Put a large pot of water on to boil
for the pasta. Put the bay leaf, the wine, and the water in a large
covered non-reactive skillet and bring to a boil. Simmer for 5 min.
Return to med-high heat and add clams. Cover. Cook until you start to
hear clams popping open - about 5 min. Begin checking on clams every
30 seconds and remove clams to heated covered bowl as they open,
replacing covers each time. If any clams have not opened after 10
minutes total cooking, discard them. When clams are done, pour all
accumulated broth into a pitcher and set aside. Put pasta in boiling
water to begin cooking and set timer so that pasta will be slightly
undercooked. Return skillet to moderate heat and add olive oil,
garlic, flour, and half the minced herbs. Cook 2 - 5 minutes, but
***do not let the garlic even begin to brown***. Add about a cup of
the clam broth. Stir with a whisk. Broth should thicken slightly into
a thin sauce. Reduce or add more broth as necessary. Whisk in the
creme fraiche and the hot sauce and bring just back to a simmer, then
remove from heat. Toss with cooked pasta. Put pasta on heated bowls
and surround with clams. Sprinkle generously with freshly-ground
pepper and the other half of the herbs.

Clay Pot Shrimp With Bean Thread Noodles - Go

pasta, seafood, thai

8 oz bean thread noodles
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 cup cilantro pesto (see recipe)
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely chopped
1 lb shrimp, peeled & deveined
1/3 cup coarsely chopped green onion
1/4 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoon fish sauce (nam pla)
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon chinese rice wine or:
1  dry sherry
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon asian sesame oil
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  handful of cilantro leaves
      ----CILANTRO PESTO----
1 teaspoon whole white or black
1  peppercorns
2 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh
1  cilantro roots or leaves
1  and stems
2 tablespoon coarsely chopped garlic

CILANTRO PESTO:  Using a mortor and pestle or a spice grinder, crush
or grind the peppercorns to a fine powder. Combine the pepper,
cilantro roots and garlic; work the three inngredients innto a fairly
smooth paste in the mortor or in a small blender or food processor.
If you use a blender or food processor, you may need to add a little
vegetable oil or water to ease the grinding.  Make about 1/4 cup. For
an industrial strength batch use 1 tb peppercorns, 1/2 cup cilantro
roots and 1/2 cup garlic. To store the pesto for later use, put in a
glass jar, pour a little oil onto the surface to cover it and seal
tightly. It will keep nicely for about 1 week in the refrigerator.

CLAY POT SHRIMP:  Place the noodles in a large bowl and add warm
water to cover.  Soak the noodles until they become limp and white,
about 15 minutes.  Drain and set aside. You should have about 5 cups
softened noodles.  In a large clay pot or flameproof, heavy-bottomed
casserole, heat the oil over medium heat until hot, about 1 minute.
Add the pesto and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute, adding a
little more oil if it sticks or burns.  Add the ginger and shrimp and
stir-fry for 1 minute. Toss in the green onion, turning the mixture
once more. Transfer the shrimp to a plate and set aside while you
prepare the noodles and sauce. In a small bowl, combine the chicken
stock, fish sauce (Nam Pla), oyster sauce, rice wine, soy sauce,
sesame oil, sugar and salt; stir to mix well. Place the soaked
noodles in the clay pot in which you cooked the shrimp mixture.
Scrape the shrimp mixture over the noodles and pour in the chicken
stock mixture.  Toss the noodles and shrimp a little to combine them
with the sauce, then cover the pot tightly.  Place the clay pot over
medium heat and cook until the noodles are soft and clear and the
shrimp is done, about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with the cilantro leaves
and serve at once.

Cleaning Fresh Crabs

chinese, seafood

1  information

Here's what Ken Hom has to say about cleaning fresh crabs. Just one
point that he overlooks...  I can't bring myself to cook or dismember
a live animal.  In another book it says that a crab can be killed
instantly and painlessly by stabbing through the shell just behind
the eyes.

Cracking and Cleaning a Live Crab

As soon as a crab (or any shellfish) is killed, it starts to lose
flavor. To preserve the full freshness and taste, crab must be cut up
just before cooking. Once you eat crab prepared this way, you will
never want to go back to precooked crab.  The texture and flavor are
worlds apart. West Coast Dungeness crab, used here, is meatier and
sweeter than the blue crabs caught in eastern waters.  Their
structures are identical, however, so the technique is the same for
both. To keep from getting pinched, hold the crab from the back or
wear thick gloves.  The cracked and cleaned crab pieces can be
stir-fried or steamed.  If you can't imagine yourself cutting up a
live crab, steam it for 5 minutes first then cut it up as described
here.

[The following steps are illustrated with photos in the book, but I
think you'll be able to get the idea. S.C.]

1.  Always hold the crab at the back to avoid the large pincers.

2.  Twist off the large pincers.  Then break off the rest of the
smaller legs.  Scrub the shells clean under running water.

3.  Pull the large top shell off the crab in one piece. Set it aside.

4.  Pull off the feathery lungs and rinse the crab's body clean under
running water.

5.  On the bottom of the crab, find the "tail", a piece of shell that
is folded against the crab's bottom. Pull this tail away from the
body.

6.  Removing the tail exposes the inside of the crab. Rinse it out.

7.  In the large shell, near the mouth, there is a small dark sac.
Remove it with a spoon, being careful not to break it. Don't remove
the yellowish-brown "crab butter" from the shell, which has a rich
flavor.

8.  Cut the body in quarters.

9.  Crack the claws by tapping them with a cleaver, or by placing a
cleaver on top of the claw and hitting the back of the cleaver with
the heel of the hand. [Place the cleaver's flat side on top of the
claw. S.C.]

10.  Cut the tips off the legs.

11.  Crack the legs one by one.  Turn each leg so that the edge is up,
enabling you to tap the shell with the side of a cleaver just hard
enough to crack the shell, but not so hard as to crush the fragile
meat.

Schuster, New York.  1981.

Cockle Chowder

british, seafood, soups

4 pint cockles, well washed
4 slice bacon, chopped
1 oz butter
1  spanish onion, chopped
3  floury potatoes, cubed
3/4 pint milk
4 tablespoon chopped parsley
1  freshly ground pepper

Take a large pan with a lid and put a little water in it to boil. When
boiling, toss in the cockles, clap the lid on and cook 5 mins or so,
shaking to cook the cockles evenly. When they have all opened, tip
into a colander over a bowl. Remove cockles forthwith from their
shells, and spread out to cool quickly. Strain the liquor carefully
to remove and sand.

Meanwhile parboil the potatoes for about 10 minutes, and in another
pan, melt the butter, let the bacon sizzle in it a moment or two, add
the finely chopped onion, put the lid on and sweat till the onion
becomes transparent. Add the milk, cockle liquor, potatoes and bring
to the boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook very gently till the
potatoes are soft but not a total mush. If you cook too quickly, or
the potatoes are not properly parcooked, the milk will curdle. It
isn't serious, just less attractive.

Chop the cockles roughly, add them to the soup, pepper it and add the
parsley. Taste for saltiness, (it shouldn't need any as the bacon and
cockles are both naturally salty.

Serve with ships biscuits, which you can break into the chowder. Water
biscuits or crackers will substitute.

      ----DIPPING SAUCE----
1 lb orange marmalade or apricot jam (us; e an entire jar)
5 tablespoon brown mustard
5 tablespoon horseradish
      ----SHRIMP AND BATTER----
2  eggs
1 3/4 cup flour
3/4 cup beer
1 tablespoon baking powder
48 medium shrimp (peeled), with tails
3 cup coconut (unsweetened), grated

Combine the seasoning mix together in a bowl.  Stir the dipping sauce
ingredients together in a second bowl. Have this ready at the table
when the shrimp are done.

Mix together about 2 t of the seasoning mix, about 1 1/4 cups of
flour, the beer and the baking powder, and place this in a third bowl.

Combine the remaining flour with another 2 t of the seasoning mix.

Coat each shrimp with the remaining seasoning mix, then in the flour
mixture, then in the batter, then in the coconut. Deep-fry the shrimp
for about 1 minute and drain on paper towels.

NOTES:

*  Shrimp in coconut beer batter with dipping sauce -- Adapted from
Chef Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen." A nice appetizer, though
very caloric.

*  Don't put too much batter on or it will overwhelm the poor shrimp.
The dipping sauce is great for other things as well.

: Difficulty:  easy if you can deep-fry.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  Measure batter, improvise with spices and dipping sauce.

Cod With Garlic

fish, low fat, main dish

1 1/2 lb fresh cod fillets
1/4 cup plus (see next line)
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
5 tablespoon thinly sliced garlic
3 tablespoon flour
4 tablespoon coarsley chopped fresh cilantro
1  salt and pepper

Rinse the fillets and pat dry. Place the fillets in a glass or enamel
coated dish with 2" sides, and sprinkle with the lime juice. Cover
with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. In a large heavy
skillet, combine the oil and butter and heat over medium heat. Add
the garlic and saute only until light brown; be careful not to burn
or the dish will be bitter. Using a slotted spoon, remove the garlic
and set aside; remove the pan from the heat, but hold for cooking the
fish. Remove the fish from the dish, reserving the lime juice, and
pat dry with a paper towel. Dust it lightly with the flour and shake
off the excess. Warm the skillet over medium-high heat and quickly
fry the fish 2-3 minutes per side, or until brown and crisp outside
and just done on the inside. Remove fish to a heated platter and keep
warm while you finish the dish. Return the garlic to the skillet and
reheat. Stir in the reserved lime juice, cilantro, and salt and
pepper to taste. Heat just until the cilantro begins to wilt.Pour the
sauce over the fish and serve immediately.

Cold Crabmeat Nacho

appetizers, seafood

24 oz cream cheese
2 tablespoon mayonnaise; the real thing
1 dash tabasco
1/4 cup green onions; minced
1/4 cup celery; coarsely chopped
1 dash paprika
1  salt and pepper, to taste
1 can black olives; finely chopped (16 oz. ca
1/2 lb crabmeat; flaked
1  nacho cheese flavor doritos

The best way to prepare this recipe in a food processor, because
it chops the ingredients finely enough and blends them together for
you. But if a food processor is not handy, you can use a blender and
a chef's kniofe.  It will still come out great, no matter how you do
it!
First, mix the cream cheese to a pasty consistency. It has to be
soft and pliable.  THen, in a large mixing bowl, whip together the
cheese and the mayonnaise until the mixture is smooth. Toss in the
Tabasco at this point and blend it in, too.  Next, add the minced
onions, the celery, the seasonings, the finely chopped black olives,
and the crabmeat. Just put them all together -- it's not necessary to
add them one at a time. But is *is* necessary to blend them all
*gently*. If you get rough, you'll smash the ingredients and you'll
lose the crispness.
When you're ready to serve, lay out the *whole* bag of Doritos on
a pizza pan and stuff each one, heaping on the crabmeat mixture and
sprinkling the tops with paprika. To increase the flavor, put the
stuffed chips in the refrigerator for an hour or two. Author's note:
...While crabmeat is used in the original dish, you can also
substitute chopped shrimp or crawfish for the crabmeat, and the basic
mix is also excellent for stuffing avocados, tomatoes, celery stalks,
and just about anyting your taste dictates. Note from me: I don't
care for Nacho Cheese Flavor Doritos but instead these are great with
the unsalted style chips you get with salsa at Mexican restaurants.

Cold Glazed Salmon

appetizers, seafood

3/4 cup dry white wine
8  basil leaves
3  tarragon (plus more for garn sh)
3  shallots, minced
2  rosemary
2  lemon slices
3  celery leaves
7 lb whole salmon, cleaned, rinse , patt; ed dry
8 cup fish aspic  (see recipe)
1  turnip
1  egg yolk, hard cooked, mashe
1 teaspoon unsalted butter

In a small saucepan, combine the wine, basil, 3 tarragon sprigs,
shallots, rosemary, lemon, and celery. Simmer the mixture for 20
minutes or until the liquid is reduced to about 3 Tbsp. Lay the
salmon on a piece of heavy foil, twice as long as the fish. Pick up
edges of foil and pour the wine mixture over the fish. Season with
salt and fold the foil to enclose it, crimping the edges tightly to
secure them. Put the salmon on a large baking sheet or roasting pan
and bake it in the middle of a preheated 375f oven for 50-60 minutes
or until the fish just flakes. Transfer the package to a work
surface, open foil carefully, and remove the skin from the top of the
salmon below the head to the bottom of the salmon at the tail. Scrape
away any brown flesh, leaving head and tail intact. Drain liquid from
the foil, and using the foil as a guide, invert the fish onto a
platter. Remove foil and skin and prepare the other side of the
salmon in the same manner. Chill the fish, covered, overnight. Peel
turnip and cut into thin slices. Trim each slice to ressemble a
flower or cut with a flower cutter. Place in a bowl of ice water to
hold until ready for use. Mash the egg yolk with the butter and
reserve at room temperature. Spoon a thin coat of cool but liquid
fish aspic over the salmon and arrange the additional tarragon sprigs
and turnip flowers decoratively on the fish. Spoon a thin coat of
liquid aspic over the whole. Transfer the yolk mixture to a pastry
bag fitted with a decorative tip. Pipe the mixture into the centers
of the flowers. Chill the salmon for at least 2 hours or up to 6
hours. Serve surrounded with the chilled aspic, chopped. a 1964

Cold Trout In Orange Marinade

seafood

3  trout (about 3/4 lb each),
1  gutted and scaled but with
1  heads and tails left on
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup flour, spread on a plate
2 tablespoon onion, chopped very fine
1 cup dry white italian vermouth
2 tablespoon chopped orange peel, using
1  only the rind, not the pith
1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange
1  juice
1  freshly squeezed juice of
1  one lemon
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 tablespoon chopped parsley

1.  Wash the gutted, scaled fish in cold water and pat thoroughly dry
with paper towels. 2. Put the oil in a skillet and turn on the
heat to medium.  When the
oil is hot, lightly dredge both sides of the fish in flour and
slip
into the skillet.  Don't overcrowd the pan; if all the fish does
not
fit loosely at one time, cook it in batches, dredging it in flour
only
at the moment you are ready to put it into the pan. 3. Brown the
fish well on one side, then turn it and do the other,
calculating about 5 minutes on the first side and
4    minutes on the
second.  Using a slotted spatula or spoon, transfer the fish when
browned to a deep serving dish broad or long enough to accommodate
all of it without overlapping.  Do not pour out the oil in the
skillet. 4. With a well-sharpened knife, make two or three
diagonal cuts on both
side of the fish.  be careful not to tear the skin, and avoid
cutting
into the flesh. 5. Put the chopped onion into the skillet that
still contains the oil in
which you cooked the fish.  Turn on the heat to medium and cook
the
onion until it becomes colored a pale gold. 6. Add the vermouth
and the orange peel.  Let the vermouth bubble gently
for about 30 seconds, stir, then add the orange juice, lemon
juice,
salt, and a few grindings of pepper.  Let everything bubble for
about
half a minute, stirring two or three times.  Add the chopped
parsley,
stir once or twice, then pour the entire contents of the skillet
over
the fish in the serving dish. 7. Allow the fish to steep in its
marinade at room temperature for at
least 6 hours before refrigerating.  Plan to serve the fish no
sooner
than the following day.  Do serve it within 3 days at the latest
to
enjoy its flavor at its freshest.  Take it out of the refrigerator
at least 2 hours before bringing to the table to allow it to come
to
room temperature.  Before serving, garnish it, if you like, with
fresh slices of orange. ~--

Coquille St.Jacques Savoie

fish

1 cup dry white wine
1  onion, stuck with a clove
1 large bouquet garni*
6  peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 lb bay scallops
      ----SAUCE----
1 tablespoon dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon dry english mustard
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1/2  lemon, juice of
4  egg yolks
10 tablespoon sweet butter
1  salt
1  freshly ground white pepper
1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
2 teaspoon small capers, well drained
      ----GARNISH----
1 tablespoon finely chopped chives
2  lemons, quartered

* Bouquet Garni - In a piece of cheesecloth, tie the following: 3 to 4
sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 t dry
thyme.  Leave the string long enough to hang the garni in the pot and
tie the string to the pot handle for easy removal. In a large
saucepan combine the wine, onion, Bouquet Garni and peppercorns.
Season with salt and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. Add the
scallops. Cover the saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove the
pan from the heat. Drain the scallops and keep them warm. In a bowl
beat the mustards, tomato paste and lemon juice into a smooth paste.
Add the egg yolks to the mustard mixture and beat until it is light
and creamy. Melt the butter in the top part of the double boiler over
hot water. The butter should be warm, NOT hot. Keep the water
simmering and slowly whisk the yolk mixture into the melted butter.
The sauce should get thick and creamy. Be sure not to let it come to
a boil or the yolks will curdle.  Remove the sauce from the heat.
Season it with salt and pepper.  Add the parsley, capers and finally
the warm well-drained scallops.  Serve immediately, garnished with
chives and lemon quarters. Note:  In certain regions of France this
course is served surrounded by boiled potato balls and buttered
carrots.

Coquilles Saint-Jacques Sautees A La Provenca

italian, shellfish

1 lb or about 2 c. scallops
1  cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1  lemon juice, salt, and
1  pepper
1/2 cup flour
1  olive oil or cooking oil
1  a 10 inch frying pan
1  (preferably a no-stick
1  pan)
2 tablespoon minced shallots or
1  scallions
1  clove garlic, mashed
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon minced fresh parsley

Dry the scallops in paper towels, then place on a large sheet of waxed
paper.  Sprinkle with drops of lemon juice, then with salt and
pepper. The moment before sauteing, dredge with flour and shake in a
sieve to dislodge excess flour. Film the frying pan with a 1/16-inch
layer of oil. When almost smoking, add the scallops. Toss for 4 to 5
minutes until scallops are lightly browned.  Then toss for a moment
with the shallots or scallions, and garlic; finally toss with the
butter and parsley and serve. Suggested accompaniments: If the
scallops are a first course, accompany with French bread. For a main
course, accompany with broiled tomatoes and green beans. Notes:
Sauteed scallops should be crisp light brown outside and moistly
tender inside. Keys to success are: have your sauteing oil very hot
before the scallops go in, and have no more than one layer of
scallops in the pan.  Otherwise the scallops will steam, exude
moisture, and will not brown. You may find, in using frozen scallops,
that they will start out nicely, then suddenly release juices in the
pan; to avoid this, blanch them before cooking by dropping them in a
large pan of rapidly boiling water and bringing them quickly back to
the boil, then drain immediately, dry them, and proceed with the
recipe.

1 lb scallops
4 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
3 tablespoon flour
1 cup dry white wine
2/3 cup water
2  parsley sprigs
4  whole black peppercorns
1 pinch dried thyme
1  bay leaf
1/2 cup shallots; or onion chopped
1  egg yolk
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1  cayenne to taste
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs

onion in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil 10 minutes, strain and
return liquid to the pan; add scallops, cover and let simmer 3

you can use evaporated skim milk for a reduced fat version], add a
little of the hot sauce, stir into yolk mixture then stir back again
into the hot sauce and turn off heat. Stir in lemon juice, cayenne,
mushrooms and scallops. Divide into lightly greased scallop shells (6
servings, if an appetizer) or 3 individual serving casserole dishes

skillet. Mix in the grated Parmesan. Sprinkle this mixture over the
scallops. With a pastry tube pipe a line of whipped potatoes around
the edges of the shell/dish.

Crab Casserole In A Clay Pot

chinese, seafood

1 1/2 lb fresh whole crab, preferably live
2 tablespoon peanut oil
5  unpeeled garlic cloves, crushed
2  unpeeled fresh ginger slices, 1/4 i; nch thick
3  whole scallions, cut into 2-inch pi; eces
3 tablespoon fermented black beans
2  fresh red chili peppers, seeded and; shredded
3 tablespoon rice wine
2 tablespoon light soy sauce
1/2 cup rich chicken stock

Well here it is, in all its glory.  I've included Hom's method for
making stock both because it's good and to give more of a feel for
the book. Honk Kong is an extremely, almost excessively dynamic city
and this is reflected in the food.  The book is interesting because
he has a finger on the development of the "new" Hong Kong cuisine and
notes traditional recipes from which the ones in the book spring.

BTW, Michael++my roommate++and I were talking about this dish last
night as we were munching up a plain old steamed Dungeness crab. He
said he *really* liked this recipe. I found it too heavy on the black
beans and spices. Here it is.  You be da judge...  ;-}

Here is an interesting, innovative technique employed by Hong Kong
chefs. The clay pot traditionally is used for the long simmering and
braising of foods; nowadays, however it is as often used to infused
intense flavors over high heat in a short length of time, as in this
recipe. the classic Cantonese dish is given a new twist; the fresh
crab is stir-fired with aromatic seasonings and then quickly finished
over high heat in the covered clay pot.  The pungent black beans
permeate the rich crab meat, enhancing it and adding to its subtle
flavors. This delicious casserole is quite easy to prepare and turns
an ordinary dinner into a special occasion.

If you are using a live crab, prepare it according to the technique
on page 77.  [Rinse, scrub and steam for ten minutes. S.C.] Cut the
body into quarters and lightly crack the claws and legs.

Heat a wok or large skillet until it is hot and add the oil. Add the
garlic, ginger, and scallions and stir-fry to flavor the oil. Then
add the black beans, chilies, and crab. Stir-fry for2 minutes and add
the chicken stock.  Turn the contents of the wok into a clay pot or
casserole, cover, and cook over high heat for 5 more minutes or until
the crab shell turns bright red.  Serve immediately.

Makes 4 servings.

Crab Custard With Lemon Butter Sauce

appetizers, eggs, french, seafood

1  brocolli; bunch, medium cut into sm
1/2 lb crab meat; fresh or frozen trimmed o
3  eggs
3/4 cup whipping cream
3/4 cup milk salt & ground white pepper
1 pinch nutmeg, ground
      ----LEMON BUTTER SAUCE----
1/2 cup white wine
1  shallot, dry; finely chopped
1 cup butter; cut in pieces
1/4 cup whipping cream
1  lemon; juice of

In this recipe Quebec snow crab is combined with brocolli,
oven-poached and served on a sauce, nouveau cuisine fashion. This
appetizer is the creation of Chef Denis Pelletier of Moulin de St.
Laurent, a contemporary French restaurant located in an old stone
mill in the village of St. Laurent on Ile d'Orleans. Ramekins can be
filled ahead and oven poached at the last minute, or you can reheat
the cooked flan in a microwave oven for about 2 minutes at Medium (50
percent).

Cook brocolli florets in boiling salted water just until
tender-crisp; drain. Generously brush 6 to 8 ramekin or custard cups
with melted butter.
Divide crab meat with brocolli among the ramekins. In a bowl, whisk
together the eggs, cream and milk; season with salt, pepper and
nutmeg. Fill ramekins three-quarters full with the custard and set in
a shallow pan of hot water. Oven poach for 1 hour at 325F or until
set. (A knife inserted in centre should come out clean.)
Make Lemon Butter Sauce and pour onto 6 to 8 serving plates. Run a
knife around the edge of each ramekin and unmold onto sauce.

Lemon Butter Sauce:
In small saucepan, heat wine and chopped shallot. Bring to a boil
and reduce over medium-high heat until only 2 tablespoons of liquid
remain. Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, a few pieces at a
time, until sauce is smooth and all the butter is incorporated. Whisk
in cream and lemon juice. Keep warm in the top of a double boiler set
over hot water until serving time. MAKES: about 1 1/2 CUPS SAUCE

8 oz cream cheese at room tempera
8 oz crabmeat, flaked
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon worstershire sauce
1 lb wonton wrappers
1 each egg yolk beaten
4 cup oil of your choice for deep

Mix crabmeat, garlic powder and Worstershire sauce together in a bowl
and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Place one tsp. of mixture on wonton
wrapper, moisten edges with egg yolk and fold the wrapper in half to
form a triangle then seal edges. Fold the two furthermost points
under so you have something resembling a little bird. You don't have
to do the last part but I do...it looks decorative. It should look
something like this: Hope this looks OK on your screen:

Crab Rice

chinese, seafood

1  stephen ceideburg
2  green onions, chopped
1  piece fresh ginger, 2-3 cm, grated
4 tablespoon dry sherry
3 tablespoon light soy sauce
3  blue crabs
400 gm glutinous rice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon oil
1 teaspoon sugar

The Chinese have comfort food, too, and this dish qualifies. You will
need a large steamer; if you don't yet have one, they can be bought
cheaply in large Chinese or Vietnamese food stores where you can also
pick up the glutinous rice. The dish takes considerably longer to
cook than the previous recipes but little more of the cook's time. By
the time the rice is cooked, it is saturated with crab flavour.

Finely chop 2 green (spring) onions and grate 2-3 cms of fresh ginger.
Combine them with 4 tablespoons dry sherry and 3 tablespoons light soy
sauce. Prepare three green blue swimmers crabs. Chop two of them into
several pieces with a large knife or cleaver and crack the hardest
pieces of the shell with a hammer. Crack the third crab thoroughly
all over but do not chop up. Pour the sherry-soy sauce mixture over
the crabs and leave to marinate for an hour. Wash 400 grams glutinous
rice in several changes of water until the water runs clear.

Put the rice into a saucepan and pour over it 1.5 L water. Bring to
the boil and boil for 5 minutes. Drain.

In the bottom of a heatproof dish at least 12 cm deep and of a size
to fit into your steamer, pack in the chopped crab pieces, reserving
the marinade. Pour the rice over the top and pack it down. Press the
intact crab into the top of the rice. To the marinade, add a further
tablespoon soy sauce and a tablespoon oil, teaspoon salt and 1
teaspoon sugar. Pour over the crabs and rice.

Put the dish in the steamer over boiling water and steam for 35-40
minutes. Serve. Diners deal first with the top crab, now half buried
in rice, then fish around, for the rest of the crab pieces in rice.

Crab-A-Leekie Crepes

none

      ----LEMON CREPES----
3  eggs
1 teaspoon sugar [optional]
2  egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup lemon juice, fresh
1 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
3/4 cup milk
2 teaspoon lemon rind, grated
1 cup all-purpose flour
      ----FILLING----
1 lb crab or imitation crab
1 cup dry curd cottage cheese
1 small leek, thinly sliced
1/2 small tomato, finely diced
1 small lime - juice only
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning
      ----WHITE WINE SAUCE----
3 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon flour
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup sour cream, or heavy cream
1/2 cup white wine
1  salt & white pepper

Ingredient note: Imitation crab, has several commercial names but
generally consists of processed pollack with natural and imitation
flavouring. It is processed so as to resemble crab meat - a white
mean with a red exterior. This product is less expensive than natural
crab and makes an excellent substitute.

Lemon Crepes: Combine eggs, egg yolks, and lemon juice. Beat the
mixture to thoroughly combine ingredients and incorporate air into
the mixture. Add the milk and whisk again.

Sift flour, salt, sugar [if using]together in a separate bowl then
gradually incorporate into egg mixture. Add vegetable oil and blend
thoroughly. Batter should be very smooth and creamy. Do not allow
lumps to form [don't strained out lumps - they should be passed
through a sieve so as to break them down.)

Add grated lemon rind and allow the mixture to rest for one hour. If
mixture thickens during this period, 1-2 Tb of milk may be added. It
is important that the crepes do not become pancakes.

Use a large hot crepe pan [or lg round frying pan]. Add vegetable oil
to pan and swirl to coat. Gently pour in only sufficient batter to
coat the whole surface of the pan swirling to get a thin and even
coating. The crepe should be turned when the top is set and the
bottom is lightly browned. Only cook the other side until the desired
colour is achieved. Remove and set aside to cool.

Filling: Chop the crab, or imitation crab, into bite size chunks and
place in large mixing bowl. Thinly slice the white of 1 small leek.
Slicing should produce thin rounds. Press out the rounds so as to
separate the slice into small rings. Add to mixing bowl along with a
finely dice half of a small tomato.

To the mixture, add approx. 1 c of dry-curd cottage cheese, the
balsamic vinegar and the juice of one small lime. Add seasonings.
[The seafood seasoning is a commercial preparation available at most
stores.] Combine all ingredients in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap
and allow to stand in fridge for up to 2 hrs.

Remove from fridge and toss lightly. Scoop out sufficient filling to
fill the centre of each crepe. Do not overfill. Roll the crepes up
into packages and place in a microwave dish, seam side down. Allow to
stand while making sauce.

Sauce: In top of double-boiler, over medium-high heat, melt butter
and add the flour. Cook, stirring constantly until thickened. Add
liquids. Whisk while simmering gently; until mixture is the desired
consistency. Reduce heat.

Microwave the stuffed crepes. Time will vary according to quantity.
For eight filled crepes allow approx. 6 minutes. Heat until very warm
throughout. Adjust time if necessary according to microwave
capability.

Allow one crepe per person for entree, two crepes per person if
serving with a garden salad, or three per person in serving alone
with sauce. Pour a generous amount of the hot sauce over the top just
before serving.

Foot-note: the quantity of leek, the balsamic vinegar and the lime
juice should not be eliminated from this recipe [at least not without
trial]. The combination of textures between the crepe, the seafood
and the barely cooked leek are a treat. The subtle flavour variations
created by the short marination of the filling ingredients in the
juice and the vinegar, are quite delightful and work well with this
sauce.

crabmeat. Mix lightly and cook a few minutes; add seasonings. Add
vermouth and boil rapidly until liquid is almost evaporated.  Scrape
from skillet into bowl; reserve.

Swiss Cheese Sauce:  Blend cornstarch and milk; reserve. Put vermouth
in same skillet that filling was cooked in; boil rapidly until
vermouth is reduced to 2 tablespoons. Remove from heat; stir in
cornstarch and milk mixture.  Return skillet to low heat and add
cream slowly, along with salt and pepper; cook several minutes until
slightly thickened. Stir in cheese and cook until melted and

Crawfish Etouffee  Frank's Perfect

crawfish, seafood

3 lb crawfish tails; peeled
4 cup crawfish stock
1/2 cup crawfish fat; from the head s
2  sticks butter; real butter only (8 oz.)
2 cup onions; finely chopped
1/4 cup celery; finely chopped
1/4 cup bell pepper; finely chopped
1 tablespoon garlic; minced
2 tablespoon green onions; finely choppe d
2 teaspoon tomato paste
2 tablespoon cornstarch; in water
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1  dash thyme
1  dash basil
1  dash worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon parsley; finely chopped

You start off by boiling about 15 to 20 pounds of crawfish in
lightly salted water.  Since you are going to use the water as a
cooking stock, you want to make certain that the crawfish are washed
thoroughly before you put them in the pot.  Use only enough water to
barely cover the critters. Your boiling time should be about 4
minutes (timed from the point when the water begins to boil rapidly).
When they are cooked, immediately remove the crawfish from the water
with a strainer ladle and set them aside to cool. Then, using several
thicknesses of cheesecloth, strain out 6 cups of stock (you want to
have extra stock just in case you need it) and set it aside. Peel the
meat out of the crawfish tails, scoop the fat out of the heads, and
devein the tails. Then divide the tails into two equal portions.
Leave one portion whole, and grind up the other portion until the
meat is finely ground.
In your heavy 12-inch stainless steel or aluminum (_not_ black
iron) skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and begin sauteeing
the onions, celery, bell pepper, garlic and green onions, cooking
until they wilt. This should take about 7 minutes, and you should
stir constantly. When the vegetables are ready, stir in the tomato
paste and cook it about 2 or 3 minutes.  Then pour in 4 cups of the
crawfish stock, stirring it well into the vegetable mixture. Also
stir in the crawfish fat. When it is mixed well, cover the pot and
let the liquid simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes.  After the
simmering process, remove the cover and gradually stir in the liquid
cornstarch (dry starch dissolved in just enough water to make it
fluid). Then cover the pot again and let the sauce simmer over low
heat for another 5 minutes. Remember! You still have 2 cups of stock,
and you can use it later to adjust the consistency of the sauce.
Next, add the ground crawfish tails, stir them into the gravy,
and mix in the paprika, salt, cayenne, white pepper, black pepper,
thyme, basil and Worcestershire sauce.  Blend everything together
really well, and taste the dish _for each ingredient_. If anything
needs adjusting (more salt, more pepper, etc.), do it now. Then cover
the pot, bring the mixture to a _near boil_, and immediately take the
pot off the fire. Leaving it covered, let the etouffee cool down to
room temperature so that the flavors will be distributed evenly.
After making this dish over and over again, I've found that this one
step is probably the secret trickery that makes my etouffee
succulent. Add more stock if desired.
Finally, after the mixture is cool -- and when you're ready to
eat ~- reheat it to serving temperature, put in the whole crawfish
tails, stir in the parsley, cover the skillet, and simmer for 3
minutes. Then spoon the etouffee over steamed, buttered rice... and
pretend your folks came from Nova Scotia! Hint: Because of the
flavoring process, this etouffee will increase in richness the longer
it sits. For some reason, it seems to taste better the next day. And
it will freeze well. Also note that the sauce should have the
consistency of heavy cream -- not thick, but not watery either!

1 teaspoon thyme leaves
4 cup crawfish tails - boiled, finely cho; pped
2 cup bread crumbs - fine
1  salt, pepper and tabasco to taste
1  egg

CRAWFISH STUFFED MANICOTTI: Melt the 4 tablespoons butter. Fry the
green onions, parsley and garlic until onions are wilted. Add the
crawfish tails and let all of this fry until sizzling hot. Heat a
small pot and pour in the brandy. Remove the crawfish from fire,
ignite the brandy and pour into the crawfish mixture. Toss until
flames die down. Set aside.

In another pot, melt 8 tablespoons butter.  Add the flour and let
this cook on a low fire until flour is cooked, about 2 minutes,
stirring often. Add the cream, milk, ketchup and tomato paste,
stirring constantly until sauce comes to a boil and starts to thicken.

Add the wine, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and
Tabasco.

Combine both pans and simmer for a few minutes.  If sauce is too
thick, thin it out with a little more milk.

Cook manicotti according to package directions.

Note:  Do not use crawfish cooked with crab boil.

STUFFING: Melt the stick of butter. Fry onions, green onions, celery,
green pepper, garlic and parsley until wilted. Add crawfish meat,
lemon juice, bay leaves and thyme. Let all of this cook for about 10
or 15 minutes or until vegetables are cooked.  Add bread crumbs,
salt, pepper and Tabasco.

Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring often.  If stuffing is too moist,
add a little more bread crumbs. Add the egg and mix well.

Stuff the manicotti carefully and lay them in a lightly greased
baking dish in a single layer.

Pour most of the sauce over the manicotti and bake covered in a 350 F
preheated oven for about 35 to 40 minutes or until manicotti are fully
cooked.  Spoon reserved sauce over manicotti when served.

Serves 5 to 7.

Note:  Do not use crawfish cooked with crab boil.

Crayfish Etouffee

cajun, fish, main dish

3/4 lb butter
6 cup chopped onion
2 cup chopped green pepper
5  cloves of garlic
4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup tomato paste
3 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/2 cup water
1 1/2 cup white wine
4 lb crayfish tail meat
1  scallion, chopped
1 teaspoon kitchen bouquet

In large heavy pot, melt butter and saute onions, celery, green
pepper and garlic until soft. Stir in salt, black and cayenne pepper,
sugar and tomato paste. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20
minutes. Dissolve cornstarch in water; add wine to mixture. Cook for
20 minutes or until sauce thickens. Add crayfish, green onion and
Kitchen Bouquet. Refrigerate overnight. Reheat and serve over rice.
Don't overcook. Boiling crayfish: Discard any dead crayfish in the
sack. Wash crayfish in clean, cool water just before cooking. They do
not need to be purged with salt during washing.   Place the live
crayfish in boiling water and boil for 10 minutes. (Season the water
with one pound of salt per five gallons of water. Add other seasoning
to taste, including cayenne, garlic, onions, lemons, lemon juice and
crab boil.) Don't begin timing cooking until watter returns to a buil
after adding crayfish. It's usual to add potatoes and corn on the cob
to the boil. Crayfish are easiest to peel when still warm.

*DIRECTIONS*

Generously butter 9-1/2-inch diameter deep-dish pie plate. Place 1
phyllo sheet on work surface (cover remaining pieces with plastic
wrap, then with clean damp towel). Brush phyllo sheet with butter and
fold in half lengthwise.  Brush folded surface with butter. Cut in
half crosswise. Place 1 phyllo rectangle, buttered side down, in
prepared pie plate, covering bottom and letting pastry overhang 1
section of edge by 1/2-inch. Brush top of phyllo in pie plate with
butter. Place second phyllo rectangle in pie plate, covering bottom
and letting pastry overhang another section of edge by 1/2-inch;
brush with butter. Repeat process with remaining 4 phyllo sheets,
making certain entire surface of edge is covered to form crust. Fold
overhang under to form crust edge flush with edge of pie plate. Brush
crust edges with butter. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and
refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 350F. Whisk yolks and mustard in medium
bowl to blend. Beat in eggs, half and half, cream, salmon, onions and
chopped dill. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour into
prepared crust. Bake until center is set, about 50 minutes. Transfer
to rack. Cool. Garnish with dill sprigs and serve slightly warm or at
room temperature.

NOTE:  Purchased phyllo pastry is used here instead of a regular pie
crust for quick and easy assembly.  This tart is best when served at
room temperature.

Creamy Trout Mousse

appetizers, seafood

2  trouts (6 oz ea. cleaned) *
1  whole egg
1  egg white
1/4 pint olive or sunflower oil
5 tablespoon creamy yoghurt
1 teaspoon dijon mustard
1 1/4 teaspoon gelatine powder (or more)
1  fresh parsley & tarragon
1/2  cucumber
1  caster sugar
1  tarragon vinegar

*Note: In lieu of fresh trout, 1/2 lb cooked and flaked fish may be
used. Serves 6 as an appetizer, or 3 as a light lunch.

If using fresh trout, poach them in the oven at 350 F (180 C) gas
mark 4 for 30 minutes, then cool, skin, bone and flake - there should
be about 8 ounces of cooked flesh.

Separate the egg and use the yolk to make mayonnaise: season it with
salt and pepper, gradually beat in the oil, then 1 teaspoon or so of
vinegar to thin and flavour the sauce.

Put the prepared fish into a food processor.  Add the mustard,
yoghurt and 1 heaped teaspoon each fresh chopped tarragon and
parsley, and whizz to a perfectly smooth puree. Soak the gelatine
(more may be necessary in hot weather) in 3 tablespoons cold water,
let it soften and swell, then dissolve over low heat. Cool for a
minute or two before adding the liquid gelatine to the fish puree:
pour it on in a thin stream while the machine is running.  Carefully
and gradually beat the fish puree into the mayonnaise. Quickly whisk
the egg whites to snowy peaks and fold them into the fish puree.
Taste and adjust the seasoning. Divide the mixture between 6 ramekins
or 3 small souffle dishes. Cover and chill for 2-3 hours until set to
a soft cream.

Seed the cucumber but do not peel.  Chop it finely, sprinkle it with
1/4 teaspoon each salt and caster sugar and 1/2 teaspoon tarragon
vinegar, and set aside for a couple of hours to draw out some of the
cucumber juices. Drain and pat dry.  Top each mousse immediately
before serving with a small spoonful of the cucumber - a good crunchy
contrast to the soft textured mousse - and garnish with a tarragon
leaf. Oatcakes that have been gently warmed in the oven go well with
this dish.

shrimp, or serve them in their shells and let diners peel them at the
table. Blanch bean sprouts in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and
refresh with cold water.

To assemble: Moisten rice papers in warm water for 10 to 20 seconds,
or until softened. Place a lettuce leaf inside each piece of softened
rice paper. Fill with a few shrimp, a little pineapple, bean sprouts,

Curried Eel (Aal I Karry)

danish, seafood

1  or 2 eels
1 large onion
1  parsley
1/3 cup flour
1 tablespoon butter
1  scant teaspoon curry

One large or two small eels are suitable for 4 persons. Skin the eel,
cut in pieces as long as a finger and put in boiling salt water with
a top of parsley.  Use water enough to cover only half the fish, so
the stock will be good and strong.  Cook the eel until it is tender
and keep it hot while making the sauce. Melt butter in a pot, brown a
large onion and add flour and curry.  Dilute with the fish stock
until the sauce is thick enough. Taste it, and if it is not strong
enough add more curry. Pour it over the eel, serve in a deep dish and
have an extra dish of fluffy steamed rice.

Curried Frogs' Legs - Ech Nau Ca-Ri

seafood, vietnamese

1  stephen ceideburg
4  pairs of jumbo frog's legs
1  stalk fresh lemon grass, or
1 tablespoon dried lemon grass
2  fresh red chilies, seeded and slice; d
2  shallots, sliced
2  garlic cloves, crushed
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon curry paste
2 teaspoon curry powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon nuoc mam (fish sauce)
2 oz cellophane noodles
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 cup chicken broth or water
1/2 cup coconut milk or heavy cream
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1  fresh ground black pepper
1  coriander sprigs for garnish

This delicious lemon grass and coconut-laced curry comes from southern
Vietnam. If you prefer a very hot curry, simply use more chile
peppers.

Cut the frogs' legs into bite-size pieces. Rinse with cold water to
remove any chipped bones. Pat dry and refrigerate.

If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and
upper half of the stalk. Cut into thin slices and finely chop. If you
are using dried lemon grass, soak it in warm water for 1 hour. Drain
and finely chop.

In a blender, combine the lemon grass with the chiles, shallots,
garlic, sugar, curry paste, curry powder, salt and 1 tablespoon of
the fish sauce. Process to a very fine paste. Rub the paste over the
frogs' legs. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
Drain. Cut into 2-inch sections.

Heat the oil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute
until translucent. Add the frogs' legs and brown well on all sides,
about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce
the heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.

Uncover the pan and add the coconut milk, the cornstarch diluted in 1
tablespoon of cold water and the remaining 1 table- spoon fish sauce.
Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.

Add the cellophane noodles and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove
from the heat.

Sprinkle with black pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs.

Serve immediately with rice, French bread or over rice noodles.

Note: Instead of discarding the upper half of the lemon grass, crush
it and cook it with the frogs' legs for extra flavor. Remove the
stalk before serving.

Yield: 4 servings.

Curried Mussels With Mushrooms

australian, seafood

3 large mussels
1 cup water
1/2 teaspoon baby dried red chillies
15  ghee
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2  cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon chopped fresh lemon grass
2  green shallots, chopped [scallions; s.c.}
340 can coconut milk
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
150  baby mushrooms, sliced
2 teaspoon plain flour
1 tablespoon water, extra
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil

The photo of this recipe looks wonderful too.  Whole shelled mussels
in a white "curry" sauce along with slices of button mushrooms and
other goodies.  The curry isn't what we would normally think of as a
curry++ there isn't any curry powder called for (though it would
probably be good).

1:  Scrub mussels under cold running water; remove beards. Combine
mussels and water in large saucepan, cover, bring to boil, reduce
heat, simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain mussels,
remove and discard shells; reserve mussels.

2:  Place chillies in small bowl, cover with boiling water, let stand
for 10 minutes; drain and chop chillies. Heat ghee in medium frying
pan, add chillies, ginger, garlic, lemon grass and shallots, stir
over medium heat for about 2 minutes or until shallots are soft.

3:  Stir in coconut milk, sauce and sugar, bring to boil, reduce heat,
simmer, uncovered, for 1 minute. Stir in mushrooms, cook over medium
heat for 1 minute. Blend flour with extra water, stir into mushroom
mixture, stir over high heat until sauce boils and thickens.

4:  Stir in mussels and basil, stir over medium heat until heated
through.

Serves 4.

NOTE:  Recipe is best made just before serving.  This recipe is not
suitable to freeze or microwave.

Cuttlefish With Spinach

greek, seafood

1  karen mintzias
750 gm cuttlefish or squid
1/3 cup olive oil
1  water
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
750 gm spinach
1 cup chopped spring onions
1/2  lemon (juice only)

Cuttlefish (soupies) as distinct from squid (kalamaria) are preferred
for this dish, though either may be used. Cleaning cuttlefish can be
a rather messy business as these marine molluscs have an ink sac from
which the pigment sepia is obtained.  The sac ruptures easily and is
usually ruptured by the time you purchase them, so don't be put off
by their colour ~ the ink rinses off easily.

Rinse cuttlefish or squid and remove head, attached tentacles and
intestines; discard intestines.  Pull out cuttle bone or fine
transparent bone if squid is being prepared. Pull off fine skin and
rinse. Remove eyes and beak from head, leave head attached to
tentacles and pull or rub off skin from tentacles, or as much skin as
will easily come off.

Slice hood or body into strips.  If squid are large, slice head and
tentacles - cuttlefish tentacles are usually small and these are left
intact.  Place prepared cuttlefish or squid in pan and set on medium
heat. Cover and cook for 15 minutes in its own juice. Add half the
oil, just enough water to cover, and salt and pepper to taste, cover
and simmer gently for 45 minutes or until tender.

Meanwhile trim spinach and wash thoroughly.  Drain well and chop
leaves and stalks coarsely.

Heat remaining oil in a separate pan and gently fry spring onion until
soft, add spinach and stir over heat until it wilts. Add spinach
mixture to cuttlefish or squid with lemon juice and adjust seasonings
with salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer for further 10-15 minutes.
Serve hot.

Cuttyhunk Paprika Scallops

main dish, seafood

3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 tablespoon paprika
1/4 cup flour
1 3/4 lb scallops
4 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup scallion -- chopped
2 tablespoon parsley -- chopped

Combine bread crumbs, paprika, and flour in a mixing bowl. Add the
scallops and toss thoroughly to coat. Melt the butter over medium
high heat in a large frying pan. If you do not have a pan large
enough to hold scallops in 1 layer, cook them in 2 batches. Add the
scallops and cook for 5 minutes, stirring gently. Let them brown
nicely, then add the scallions and parsley. Cook for 3 minutes and
serve on hot plates, garnished with lemon slices. The nutty flavor of
short grain brown rice is perfect with this scallop dish.

Dancing Prawns

seafood, thai

1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 tablespoon minced shallot
1 teaspoon minced fresh galangal or ginger
1 tablespoon minced lemon grass
1  salt
1 tablespoon each, lemon juice, soy sauce
2 tablespoon chinese rice wine or dry sherry
12 large or jumbo shrimp, preferably whole
1/2  orange or apple
1  coriander sprigs, lime wedges for g; arnish

I *think* this came from Sunset Magazine.  There's nothing hot in the
ingredient list, but it would be real easy to put some cayenne or
mashed up chili peppers in the marinade. Probably more authentic as
well.

This attractive Thai presentation looks best with shrimp with their
heads still attached.  Try it with large tiger prawns or fresh
carids. Pound the garlic, shallot, galangal and lemon grass to a
paste in a mortar with a pinch of salt.  Transfer to a shallow bowl
and stir in the lemon juice, soy sauce and wine.

Using a small knife or scissors, split the shrimp shells down the
back, but leave attached.  (If the heads are present, carefully
separate the shell where the tail joins the head, then split the tail
shell open.) Devein if necessary.  Toss in the marinade and let stand
for 30 minutes to 3 hours.

Thread single shrimp lengthwise on skewers, starting at the tail end
and coming out through the head.  Push the skewer on through until
the pointed end extends at least 3 inches beyond the shrimp. Handling
by the pointed ends, grill until the meat is opaque.  To serve, place
the orange or apple cut side down on a plate and insert the pointed
ends of the skewers. Garnish with coriander sprigs and lime wedges.

Serves 4 as an appetizer or side dish.

Darley Street Thai Chuu-Chii (Red Curry)

seafood, thai

1  stephen ceideburg
10  white peppercorns
1  mace
1 teaspoon thai shrimp paste
3  to 5 long red dried chillies
4  cloves shallots
1/2  stalk lemon grass
1 teaspoon galangal
1/2 teaspoon kaffir lime zest
1 tablespoon chopped coriander root
1/2 teaspoon salt
250 ml coconut cream
2 tablespoon to 3 tb red curry paste
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1/2 tablespoon palm sugar
24  coffin bay scallops
125 ml coconut milk
5  kaffir lime leaves
1 large fresh red chilli, julienned
2 tablespoon coriander leaves
1  jasmine rice

A colleague who recently visited the Darley Street Thai at its new
location in Bayswater Road, Kings Cross, described this dish as
"exquisite". Though the recipe may seem dauntingly lengthy, most of
it is simply a long list of ingredients for red curry paste, which
can be made in quantity and stored in a container in the fridge for
3-4 weeks for further use. Frozen kaffir limes can be bought very
cheaply in good Asian stores, where the rest of the ingredients
listed should also be avail- able. Grate the limes for zest while
they are stir frozen.

In a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind to a powder 10 white
peppercorns and a few sheaves of mace. Roast 1 teaspoon of Thai shrimp
paste by zapping it in a microwave oven or putting it on a little
piece of foil under the grill.

Put the pepper-mace mixture and the shrimp paste in a blender (David
recommends a blender but some of us will have to make do with a food
processor or the mortar and pestle) and add 3- 5 long red dried
chillies, deseeded, washed and chopped, 4 cloves of true shallots,
(or substitute the same quantity of Spanish onion), 1/2 stalk of
lemon grass, sliced, 1 teaspoon galangal. peeled and chopped, 1/2
teaspoon kaffir lime zest, 1 tablespoon of coriander root, scraped
and chopped, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a little water. Process to a
very fine paste. This may take up to 10 minutes. Transfer to a
storage jar.

In a medium-size pan, boil 250 mL coconut cream over high heat,
stirring constantly, until the oil separates out, about 3-5 minutes.
(If using canned coconut cream, don't shake the can -use the solid
mass of coconut at the top of the can, plus as much of the rest as
you need to make up 250mL. If it doesn't separate within 5 minutes,
add a tablespoon of oil.) Add 2-3 tablespoons of red curry paste and
fry for 5 minutes, stirring, until fra- grant. Add 1 tablespoon fish
sauce, 1/2 tablespoon palm sugar and fry until colour deepens. Add 24
Coffin Bay scallops (12 if other dishes will be served
simultaneously) and 125 mL coconut milk. Check for sweet-sour
balance. Throw in 5 kaffir lime leaves, shredded, 1 large fresh red
chilli, julienned, and 2 tablespoons of either coriander or basil
leaves. Serve with jasmine rice.

peppercorns and a few sheaves of mace. Roast 1 teaspoon of Thai shrimp
paste by zapping it in a microwave oven or putting it on a little
piece of foil under the grill.

Put the pepper-mace mixture and the shrimp paste in a blender (David
recommends a blender but some of us will have to make do with a food
processor or the mortar and pestle) and add 3- 5 long red dried
chillies, deseeded, washed and chopped, 4 cloves of true shallots,
(or substitute the same quantity of Spanish onion), 1/2 stalk of
lemon grass, sliced, 1 teaspoon galangal. peeled and chopped, 1/2
teaspoon kaffir lime zest, 1 tablespoon of coriander root, scraped
and chopped, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a little water. Process to a
very fine paste. This may take up to 10 minutes. Transfer to a
storage jar.

In a medium-size pan, boil 250 mL coconut cream over high heat,
stirring constantly, until the oil separates out, about 3-5 minutes.
(If using canned coconut cream, don't shake the can -use the solid
mass of coconut at the top of the can, plus as much of the rest as
you need to make up 250mL. If it doesn't separate within 5 minutes,
add a tablespoon of oil.) Add 2-3 tablespoons of red curry paste and
fry for 5 minutes, stirring, until fra- grant. Add 1 tablespoon fish
sauce, 1/2 tablespoon palm sugar and fry until colour deepens. Add 24
Coffin Bay scallops (12 if other dishes will be served
simultaneously) and 125 mL coconut milk. Check for sweet-sour
balance. Throw in 5 kaffir lime leaves, shredded, 1 large fresh red
chilli, julienned, and 2 tablespoons of either coriander or basil
leaves. Serve with jasmine rice.

Deep Fried Shrimp Balls

oriental, seafood, wok

1 lb shrimp, cleaned & deveined
2  bacon strips
4  water chestnuts or
1/2 medium onion
1  salt
1  pepper
1  egg, beaten
2 tablespoon corn starch
1  oil for deep frying

1. Mince shrimp, bacon, onion or water chestnuts together until fine.
Place mixture in bowl. Remove crusts from bread. Dice bread into very
fine cubes. Place cubes in shrimp mixture. Add salt, pepper, egg and
2 tablespoons corn starch to mixture. Combine thoroughly.

2. Fill a wok halfway up with oil. Heat oil on highest heat setting.
When you think oil is sufficiently heated, test the temperature of it
with a small piece of bread crust. If it frys to a golden brown
colour, then oil is ready for deep frying. If bread crust fails to
brown readily, then oil is not ready yet. If bread crust frys to a
dark brown, then oil is too hot. Shut heat off of wok, allow oil to
cool 5 minutes before turning heat on again. Retest oil with bread
crust to see if it is of proper temperature.

3. When oil is ready for deep frying, take 2 teaspoons, dip into
shrimp mixture and form a 1" diameter ball. Drop ball into hot oil,
Place about 8 balls into the hot oil. Allow each ball to deep fry 3
minutes. Turn balls so that each will fry to a golden brown colour.
Remove balls to paper toweling to drain excess oil from them. Repeat
procedure for deep frying rest of shrimp mixture until all of the
mixture is used up. Place shrimp balls on a serving platter. Garnish
with parsley or other raw vegetable.

Deep-Fried Crab Balls With Vinegar Dip

appetizers, chinese, seafood

1/2 lb fresh cooked crab meat
2 oz pork fat from loin
6  peeled water chestnuts
1  scallion
2  eggs
2 tablespoon dry sherry
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon minced ginger root
2 cup deep-frying oil
1  vinegar dip:
2 tablespoon black chinjiang vinegar
1 tablespoon yellow rice vinegar
2 teaspoon thin soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon sugar

You can serve this dish hot or cold.  We prefer the crab balls hot,
when their exterior is crisp and the meat hot and moist. They also go
better with the vinegar dip when hot. If you prefer to serve them
cold or at room temperature, delete the dip, or substitute something
like mustard and catsup.

Preparation: If you're using food processor, crab and pork fat should
be cold.  Cut pork fat into cubes. Trim and cut scallion into 1"
sections, including greens. Using steel blade, place water chestnuts
and scallion in bowl; pulse/start to chop vegetables.  Add crab meat
and pork fat; pulse/start to mince.  Add eggs, sherry, salt, corn-
starch and minced ginger. Pulse/start 3 or 4 times to blend. Don't
overdo it; you don't want a puree.

Deep-frying: In wok or deep-fryer, heat oil until bubbles form around
a bamboo chopstick held upright in oil. Using teaspoon, form small
ball of crab mixture. Test cooking temperature; it should brown and
cook through in about 5 minutes; adjust heat if necessary. Proceed
with deep-frying about 6 balls at a time; avoid crowding them. Drain
on bamboo strainer or towel. If you can't serve them immediately,
refry briefly to crisp skin. Avoid overcooking.

Vinegar dip:  Mix ingredients in a shallow bowl; place on serving
platter and surround with crab balls.

Deep-Fried Shrimp Balls With Celery Sauce

appetizers, ethnic, sauces, seafood

1 lb shrimp
2  slices, thin ginger, fresh
1 centiliter garlic
1  stalk, good-sized celery,
1  very crisp and fresh
1 teaspoon light soy sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon vodka
3 tablespoon chicken broth
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 cup oil, for deep-frying
1  lettuce leaves

Devein the shrimp.  Chop the shrimp very finely, almost into a paste.
Mince the ginger and garlic; keep them separate. Peel the tough
strings from the celery stock; slice it at angle into pieces about
1/4-inch thick.

In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, oyster sauce, vodka, chicken
broth, and 1 tablespoon of the cornstarch. Reserve this mixture.

In another mixing bowl, combine the shrimp with half of the minced
ginger and half of the minced garlic; add the salt and the remaining
tablespoon of cornstarch.  Mix well, and with lightly moistened hands
form this mixture into balls about 1-inch in diameter.

Heat the oil to 350 degree F and deep-fry the shrimp balls 6 at a
time. Drain the balls on paper towels and them keep warm. Put 1
tablespoon of the hot oil from the deep-fry pan in a wok and stir-fry
the remaining ginger and garlic until it turns golden; add the celery
and stir-fry quickly for about for about a half a minute. Add the
reserved sauce mixture and stir until it thickens.

On a plate, make a bed of lettuce leaves and arrange the shrimp balls
on it, pour the sauce over the shrimp balls and serve hot. Makes 6 to

Deep-Fried Squid

seafood

3 lb squid, cleaned and cut into rings
1  flour for coating, at least 3 cups
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  oil for deep frying. peanut oil is; best.

Deep-fried squid is one of the most popular seafood dishes in the
world. It is made in almost every country where squid is eaten. Once
you taste it, you'll see why.  The rings emerge juicy, sweet and
crisp.

Served with several dipping sauces, this dish makes an excellent hors
d'oeuvre or main course.  This recipe calls for a dry coating. Wet
coatings, such as tempura batter, are delicious, too, though they are
a little more trouble to apply.

Dry the rings thoroughly with paper towels.  Coat with flour, to
which salt and pepper have been added.

Heat oil to 350F in a deep-fat fryer or heavy casserole. If you don't
have a temperature control or thermometer, you can guess at the
temperature by dropping a few drops of water into the oil.  It should
sizzle immediately on contact.  Plunge basket laden with one layer of
squid into oil which should bubble vigorously on contact. If you
don't have a basket for deep frying, use a large spoon or tongs to
immerse squid in oil, and to remove. Fry until coating turns golden
brown, about 3 or 4 minutes.

Remove squid and drain.  Turn down heat to moderate until just before
you are ready to cook the next batch; oil will overheat when the
fryer is empty. Remove excess oil from squid with paper towels.

Serve rings hot with any of the dipping sauces described below or with
lemon wedges.  Cole slaw is a natural with deep fried squid.

absorb the flavors and the entire soup is enormously attractive. I
went to my teacher's house one August in the middle of a three day
pre-typhoon downpour. Sheets of water poured out of the sky as my
taxi wended its way to the edge of town. The rice fields in this
rice-growing region shimmered with an intense green as the rain
engulfed the paddy. It had a wild, wet beauty but I was glad when I
arrived and could concentrate in comfort on the crabs and the soup."

1. Put the water and bean paste (denjang) into a pan and simmer over
low heat, covered, for 10 minutes. Add the bean curd and cook for 5
minutes more.

2. Now add all the other ingredients and cook for 15 minutes more.
Serve in 4 individual bowls with rice and an assortment of side
dishes.

Devilled Whitebait

fish

1  stephen ceideburg
3 tablespoon flour
2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1  salt to taste
600 gm whitefish

Heat oil for deep-frying. Put 3 tablespoons plain flour in a paper or
plastic bag and add 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper and salt to taste.

In batches, put the whitebait (600 g in total) into the bag and shake
until they are coated with seasoned flour. Shake off excess flour,
then deep-fry for 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain well
on kitchen paper.

When all the whitebait have been cooked, put them back into the frying
basket, reheat the oil and plunge the basket back into the hot oil for
another couple of minutes until they are golden. (Depending on the
capacity of your deep-fryer, you may have to do the second cooking in
batches as well.) Drain and turn out into a serving dish lined
thickly with paper napkins. Serve with wedges 6 of lemon.

Diet Shrimp Bisque

low cal, seafood, soups

2 lb fresh shrimp; -=or=- scampi, lobster or
1 tablespoon safflower; -=or=- virgin olive oil
1  leek  cleaned & sliced coarsely
1 small carrot; peeled and sliced
1  celery stalk; sliced
2  shallots; peeled and chopped
1  garlic clove  peeled & minced
1 tablespoon tomato puree
1 1/2 cup dry white wine
2 quart water
1  chicken bouillon cube  crushed
1 pinch saffron
      ----HERB BOUQUET----
1/2 teaspoon thyme; and
1/2  bay leaf, and
6  fresh parsley stems (tied in cheese; cloth)
      ----FOR THE BISQUE----
1  salt and pepper to taste
4 tablespoon cornstarch
4 tablespoon non-fat powdered milk
1/2 teaspoon cognac, armagnac or brandy
4  basil leaves; minced
1 teaspoon tarragon, minced
1 tablespoon minced chives

SEPARATE THE TAIL from the shrimp and remove the meat, reserving all
shells, claws, heads and so forth. If you wish, devein the tails, then
cover and refrigerate. Coarsely chop the heads and shells, reserving 4
heads for decoration, if you have them. In a large saucepan, heat the
oil over moderate heat, then add the shrimp shells and cook them.
Stir slowly but continuously for 5 minutes. Add the vegetables and
tomato puree and cook another 5 minutes, stirring. Add the wine and
bring to the boil for 30 seconds, scraping the bottom to dissolve any
coagulated juices. Add the water, bouillon cube, saffron and herb
bouquet. Return to a simmer and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Pour the
stock through a fine strainer into a bowl, pressing down on the
vegetables and shrimp shells with a soup ladle to extract all of the
liquid. (For a finer result, strain again through cheesecloth.)
Return the stock to the boil. Moisten the cornstarch in a little cold
water, then add it to the saucepan and boil for 4 minutes. Taste for
salt and pepper. (The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point and
refrigerated.) Bring the stock to a simmer. Add the shrimp tails and
let them cook a bare 2 minutes (for small or medium), or 3 minutes
for extra large. Remove immediately with a slotted spoon and divide
them among 4 heated soup plates. Pour the stock into a blender, add
the powdered milk and cognac. Blend until smooth and homogeneous.
Pour immediately into the soup plates over the shrimp tails. Garnish
each dish with an equal amount of the herbs and a shrimp head
(optional). This rich-tasting bisque has only 90 calories per serving.

Dinner Party Paella

cassarole, poultry, sausages, spanish

1/2 lb chorizo sausage
1 3/4 lb chicken legs
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
3 cup chicken stock, warm
1  onion, chopped
2  garlic cloves, minced
28 oz canned tomatoes
1 small sweet green pepper, diced
1 1/2 cup short-grain rice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup frozen peas
3/4 lb large raw shrimp
3/4 lb mussels
2  green onions, minced
8  lemon wedges

Authentic Spanish paella gets its name from the shallow two-handled
pan in which it is cooked. There are only three 'must have'
ingredients - short-grain rice for its velvety creaminess, saffron
for its taste and golden hue, plus olive oil - most paellas include a
colourful selection of sweet peppers, green peas, seafood, chicken
and spicy chorizo sausage, which simmers to doneness as the rice
plumps.

1. Cut sausage into 1/2-inch thick slices. Remove skin from chicken;
trim off fat. Using sharp heave knife, cut through chicken leg at
joint to separate thigh from drumstick.

2. In large paella pan or deep wide skillet, hat oil over high heat;
cook sausage, stirring, for 2 minutes or until browned. Remove to
platter. Reduce heat to medium. Add chicken and cook for 7-10 minutes
per side or until evenly browned. Add to platter.

3. Stir saffron into chicken stock; set aside to soften. Add onion and
garlic to pan; cook, stirring, for 4 minutes or until softened. Add
stock mixture, tomatoes and green pepper; bring to boil, breaking up
tomatoes with back of spoon and stirring to scrape up any brown bits
from bottom of pan [deglaze].

4. Stir in rice, salt and pepper; reduce heat to low. Add chicken;
simmer gently, stirring often, for 20 minutes. Gently stir in peas
and sausage.

5. Meanwhile, peel and devein shrimp. Scrub mussels under running
water. With shears, trim off beards. Discard any mussels with cracked
shells or ones that do not close when tapped.

6. Nestle shrimp and mussels in rice until almost covered; cook for
7-10 minutes or until rice is tender, shrimp are pink and mussels are
open. Discard any mussels that do not open.

Garnish with onions and lemon.

Test Kitchen tip: you can use clams instead of mussels, omit the
seafood altogether and double up the chicken, or replace chorizo with
any spicy sausage.

To make a fluffier paella with parboiled long-grain rice: cook,
covered adding 1/2 cup more stock near end of cooking to prevent
sticking. Garnish with trimmed fresh artichoke brushed with lemon
juice to prevent browning.

Dried Kingfish

fish, thai

1  stephen ceideburg
1  kingfish, 1 to 1-1/2lb
1 tablespoon finely sliced shallot
2 tablespoon shredded green mango
1 teaspoon shredded hot chilli
2 tablespoon fish sauce
3 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon palm sugar
2 cup cooking oil

Snagged an excellent new Thai cookbook yesterday. It's

"The Elegant Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon Kongpan and
Pinyo Srisawat. SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989. ISBN
0-943389-05-4.

This is a big, well-illustrated-with-color=photos book. Mike hauled
it home yesterday with another one, "Keo's Thai Cuisine". (Being no
dummy, he realizes that new cookbooks inspire me to cook so every so
often he'll grab something for me to avoid having to cook himself.)
But it wasn't that simple...  He'd bought them both, but intended to
keep one and send one on as a thank-you gift to a fellow that took
him and Laurie sailing a couple of weeks ago.

"You get to choose one to keep."

The dreaded words...

I paled, started to shake. Sweat beaded my brow. I grabbed the
fanciest one--the hard bound "Keo's" book--and paged through it, awed
by the illustrations, impressed by the recipes. Then I grabbed
"Elegant Taste" and started on the first page, intending to skip
through it. Instead I went through the entire book, page by page,
from start to finish. I slammed it shut.

"This one."

"Elegant Taste" explains Thai ingredients (and gives both the Thai
names and spells them out using the Thai alphabet), makes sensible
recommendations for substitutions and has relatively simple but very
good and authentic looking recipes, each of which is illustrated by a
beautiful color photo. This can be really helpful when one is cooking
a new dish and isn't sure of what it should look like and what
garnishes to use. Garnishes are particularly important in Thai
cooking as they're meant to be eaten with the dish but often are not
referred to in the recipe. For instance, in the following recipe the
dish is presented on a platter with a half dozen or so scallion
brushes and tomato slices, neither of which are referred to in the
recipe.

As for this recipe, some of you might remember a while back when I was
raving about a dried, fried fish dish I'd had in a Thai place, but
couldn't find in a cookbook. It was in "Elegant Taste" and here it is.

Plan Samli Daet Diao (Fried Sun-Dried Kingfish)

Preparation:

Wash, clean and butterfly the fish leaving the two sides joined along
the belly. Open the fish out flat so that the skin is downward,
remove the bones, and score the flesh with a knife.

After allowing it to dry, lay the fish opened out flat in strong
sunshine for five to six hours, turning regularly so the sun strikes
both the skin side and the interior.

Pour the oil into a deep frying pan and place on medium heat. When
the oil is hot, place the fish, still opened out, in the oil. When
the lower side becomes crisp and golden, turn the fish and continue
frying until it is done on both sides; then, remove from the pan,
drain, place on a serving dish.

Toss the shallots, mango and chilli together, seasoning with fish
sauce, lime juice and palm sugar so that a sour taste is the
predominant one. Spoon into a bowl and serve with the fish.

Serves two to three.

From "The Elegant Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon
Kongpan and Pinyo Srisawat. SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989.
ISBN 0-943389-05-4.

This dish is very savoury with a crunchy/chewy texture. The version I
had in the restaurant still had bones but was so well fried that I
just munched up the bones and all.

Incidentally, I'm going to buy the "Keo's" book as well. It looks
quite good too but seems to be tailored more toward Western kitchens.
For instance, it calls for brown sugar rather than palm sugar in most
recipes. Now that's a perfectly adequate substitution, but why bother
when I have palm sugar on hand? (Smug grin.)

Dry Fried Prawns In The Shell

chinese, fish

1  stephen ceideburg
1 lb large prawns in the shell
2 tablespoon oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
3  quarter-sized slices fresh ginger,; bruised
3  garlic cloves, bruised
4  green onions with tops, cut into 1-; inch lengths
1 pinch white pepper
1 pinch sugar
2 tablespoon dry sherry or rice wine
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 bunch fresh watercress

The trick to eating these is to pop them into your mouth and then
separate the shells from the meat with your teeth and tongue. If the
shells are crispy enough, eat 'em shells and all. The sauce cooks
into the shells making them very flavorful.

Leave shells and legs on the prawns. Rinse in cold water. Pat
completely dry with paper toweling.

To devein prawns, cut a 1/4-inch deep by 1/2-inch long incision down
the outside curve of each shell. (Pointed kitchen shears are useful
for this job.) Grasp the black vein and gently pull out and discard.

Preheat a wok or skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the oil,
salt, ginger and garlic.

Crush the ginger and garlic against the side of the pan with the back
of the spatula to squeeze out their juices (about 30 seconds); remove
ginger and garlic and discard.

When the oil is hot but not smoking, place a single layer of prawns
flat in the pan. Fry without stirring until browned and crusty, about
1 minute. Turn the prawns and fry without stirring until browned on
the second side, about 1 minute. Remove and keep warm while frying
remaining prawns.

When the last batch is done, increase heat to high. Return all the
prawns to the pan, along with the green onions, pepper, sugar, wine
and soy sauce. Quickly toss over high heat until liquid is reduced
and a glaze coats the shrimp, about 30 seconds. Serve on a bed of
watercress.

Ducklings Swimming In A Pond

chinese, seafood, soups

6 cup rich chicken broth
1/2 cup shelled green peas (or quartered sn; owpeas)
12  shelled baby shrimp
4  nami black mushrooms
3  egg whites
1  yellow food coloring

Even mature adults - gourmets no less - "oo" and "ah" when presented
with this simple-to-prepare soup.

Preparation:  Wash & soak mushrooms in warm water for 1 hour; slice
into thin strips; reserve.  Blanch shrimp in salted boiling water
(omit if shrimp are precooked).

Make ducklings within hour or less of serving.  Have steamer ready.

Work with eggs & mixing bowl at room temperature. Separate whites &
yolks; reserve yolks for another recipe. Beat egg whites, starting
slowly, then progressively faster after eggs begin to foam, until
eggs are stiff but not runny. If whites are too stiff, they tend to
break apart in shaping process.

Form 2 ducklings per serving.  Use tablespoon to form body; flatten
egg in spoon; turn over onto steaming plate. To body, add blob of egg
for neck & head, another piece for tail. Use toothpick to carefully
shape head & tail.

Steam one as test. Steaming should take 30-60 seconds to set surface
of egg. After steaming, swab beak & tail with yellow food coloring;
put color on toothpick to mark eyes.

Soup:  30 minutes or so before serving, heat broth to just under
boil; add mushrooms & peas.  5 minutes before serving, add shrimp &
desired seasonings.  Pour soup into warm serving bowl. Float
ducklings on soup. Serve.

1  lime cream sauce
1  (see note)
1 tablespoon oil
2/3 cup chicken stock
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon lime juice

Salt and white pepper to taste Sprigs of fresh coriander

Toss the shrimp with 1 teaspoon of the salt and let stand for 10
minutes. Rinse thoroughly, drain and pat dry.

Finely chop shrimp and put them in a mixing bowl.

Add remaining salt, ginger, rice wine, cornstarch, water chestnuts,
green onions, coriander, sausage and cheese to mix- ture; mix

If you are using won ton wrappers, trim the corner to make a circle.

the edge of the wrapper with water and fold in half to enclose
filling and form a half-circle. Pinch the edges together to seal.

Set on a baking sheet; cover with a towel. Repeat with remaining
filling and wrappers.

To cook and sauce 4 servings, add 1 tablespoon of the oil to a 10-inch
nonstick skillet and set over medium heat.

lightly browned. Turn the gyozas over to brown other side, about 1
minute longer.

Garnish with fresh coriander springs.

Note: There is enough filling to make 4 dozen gyozas. The amount of
sauce indicated above is enough for 12 gyozas. If you want to make
more, multiple the sauce ingredients, but bear in mind that you will
have to make the sauce separately as part of each batch. Freeze extra
uncooked gyozas on a baking sheet; when frozen, transfer them to a
freezer bag. Do not defrost before browning.

Easy Clam Sauce With Low-Calorie Version

fish, pasta, sauces

6 1/2 oz can minced or diced clams see note
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  clove garlic minced
1 tablespoon oregano or basil -- or
1  mixture
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  few grinds of pepper

* drain juice into small saucepan, and set clams aside.

Add garlic and seasonings to clam juice, bring to a simmer, and let
cook while the pasta cooks.  Drain pasta and return to pot in which
it was cooked. Remove juices from heat, add clams, and pour over
cooked pasta. Toss well and let stand a few minutes so juices can
permeate the pasta well before you serve it. I understand that it is
not chic to use grated parmesan or romano cheese with a seafood
sauce, but we love romano on this. These canned clams must not be
cooked--they turn into rocks if you do.

Easy Poached Fish

fish

1 quart water
1/2 medium onion; sliced
6  whole black peppercorns
3  whole allspice
3 tablespoon lemon juice
1  bay leaf
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dry white wine

Combine all ingredients in large skillet or Dutch oven. It may be
necessary to double or triple recipe if larger amount of liquid is
needed to be sure fish is just covered during poaching. Simmer for
20-30 minutes to blend flavors.  Add fish; cover and simmer over low
heat for 15-25 minutes, or until fish flakes easily when tested with
a fork. (NOTE: Avoid using high heat.  Boiling action will break up
fish.)  Lift cooked fish carefully from liquid with wide spatula.
Drain well, patting excess moisture from fish with paper towels if
necessary. Poached fish may be served hot or cold with a
complementary sauce or flaked/chunked and used in casseroles,
spreads, etc.

Ech Nau Ca-Ri (Curried Frogs' Legs)

seafood, vietnam, vietnamese

1  stephen ceideburg
4  pairs of jumbo frog's legs
1  stalk fresh lemon grass, or
1 tablespoon dried lemon grass
2  fresh red chilies, seeded and slice; d
2  shallots, sliced
2  garlic cloves, crushed
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon curry paste
2 teaspoon curry powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon nuoc mam (fish sauce)
2 oz cellophane noodles
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 cup chicken broth or water
1/2 cup coconut milk or heavy cream
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1  fresh ground black pepper
1  coriander sprigs for garnish

This delicious lemon grass and coconut-laced curry comes from southern
Vietnam. If you prefer a very hot curry, simply use more chile
peppers.

Cut the frogs' legs into bite-size pieces. Rinse with cold water to
remove any chipped bones. Pat dry and refrigerate.

If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and
upper half of the stalk. Cut into thin slices and finely chop. If you
are using dried lemon grass, soak it in warm water for 1 hour. Drain
and finely chop.

In a blender, combine the lemon grass with the chiles, shallots,
garlic, sugar, curry paste, curry powder, salt and 1 tablespoon of
the fish sauce. Process to a very fine paste. Rub the paste over the
frogs' legs. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
Drain. Cut into 2-inch sections.

Heat the oil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute
until translucent. Add the frogs' legs and brown well on all sides,
about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce
the heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.

Uncover the pan and add the coconut milk, the cornstarch diluted in 1
tablespoon of cold water and the remaining 1 table- spoon fish sauce.
Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.

Add the cellophane noodles and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove
from the heat.

Sprinkle with black pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs.

Serve immediately with rice, French bread or over rice noodles.

Note: Instead of discarding the upper half of the lemon grass, crush
it and cook it with the frogs' legs for extra flavor. Remove the
stalk before serving.

Eddy's Oyster Loaves

breads, main dish, seafood

3 small loaves french bread
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoon melted butter
3  doz fresh oysters
2 tablespoon melted butter
1  milk

First, almost split the loaves lengthwise, leaving a hinge. Scoop out
the soft middle and save the crumbs. Then add a 1/2 tsp of garlic
powder (not salt) to 2 Tbls melted butter, and brush the cavities.

Next, drain the oysters and save the liquid.  Saute' them in the rest
of the butter till the edges curl - about 5 minutes. Put the oysters
into the loaves, mix the crumbs you saved with the oyster liquid you
saved, and add them, too.  Shut up the loaves now. STOP HERE.

Then wrap them in cheesecloth dipped in milk, twisting the ends and
tucking them under the loaf.  Bake them on a baking sheet for half an
hour at 350^. Cut them in half before you serve them.

6    servings

(Note from the book: Eddy was a San Franciscan who owned a bar and
made small oyster loaves for his married male customers to take home
to their wives. These were pacifiers. But Eddy is dead now, and
Mother must pacify herself.  This is good for a special lunch. I also
know a family who has it traditionally as Christmas Eve supper.)

Egg Salad Surprise

salads, seafood

4 oz cooked lobster meat; diced,
1  hard-boiled egg; diced
1 small avocado; (ripe) diced
2  shallots
2  lemons
1 cup mayonnaise; (homemade)
1  red leaf lettuce; (romaine)
1  red ripe tomatoes
6  asparagus spears; peeled & c
1  salt and pepper; to taste

1. Mix the diced lobster meat, diced eggs and diced avocado
(sprinkled with fresh lemon juice) and fine diced shallots with
the mayonnaise, very gently. Use just enough mayonnaise to coat
and bind. Season to taste with salt and red pepper. I like to
use
the Japanese Sashimi Togarashi.

2. Spoon back into the lobster or avocado shell, and rest on a
bed of
shredded red romaine or curly lettuce. Garnish with lemon
wedges
and asparagus with reserved lobster claws on top.

Serves 1 or 2

April Fool! This is a thinly disguised Lobster Mayonnaise, with an
egg
and avocado salad, accompanied by a dish of Springtime asparagus.
Have
a sauceboat of the freshly made mayonnaise available. Serve with a
crusty bread and a chilled Chablis for a Spring Luncheon. The
Chablis
is one reason I use mayonnaise instead of vinegar. In spooning the
salad into the lobsters chest cavity, spoon it right on top of the
tomalley (the green liver of the lobster). For those who like it,
this
makes a fine taste. For those who don't, suit yourself, chacon a
son
gout!

Eggplant Stuffed With Oysters

creole, seafood

2 large eggplants, split lengthwise
2  jars (10 ounces each) oysters
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cup finely diced onion
2 large garlic cloves, minced
1/2 teaspoon herbes de provence
1/2 teaspoon creole seafood seasoning
2 tablespoon dry white wine
1  i cup fresh bread crumbs
1 tablespoon minced chives
1/4 cup grated parmesan

Creole-style seafood seasoning blends are sold in most markets; you
can use a mixture of salt and red, white and black peppers.
Chesapeake- style seasonings, such as Old Bay, are another option.

Bake the eggplant halves in a 400F oven until just tender. Scrape out
the pulp, leaving a shell about 1/2 inch thick attached to the skin.
Discard any big clumps of seeds and chop the pulp coarsely. Drain the
oysters, reserving the liquor.  Chop oysters into bite-sized pieces.

Heat the oil in a skillet; add the onion and garlic and cook until the
onion softens.  Add the herbs and seasoning mix, then stir in the
oyster liquor and wine. Reduce slightly, then stir in the eggplant
pulp, bread crumbs, oysters and chives.  Cook for 1 minute, then
taste for seasoning and adjust to taste. Spread the mixture evenly in
the eggplant shells and top with Parmesan.  Return to the oven and
bake until nicely browned.

appetizers, fish, italian

1 lb dried white beans -- * see
1  note
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil --
1  divided
2 large garlic cloves -- peeled &
1  chopped
1 oz pancetta -- chopped fine
6 large fresh sage leaves -- -or-
1 teaspoon dried whole leaf sage
1  salt and black pepper -- to
1  taste
1  tomato -- core/peel/chop
1  fine
1 lb medium shrimp -- peeled &
1  deveined

* such as cannellini, Great Northern or navy beans

Note:  The beans in this recipe will need to be soaked overnight

Put the beans in a non aluminum container and cover with 5 inches of
codl water.  Soak overnight and then drain well. Place them with all
other ingredients except the salt (see note) and shrimp, in a pot
that will comfortably hold them all.

Pour enough cold water over the ingredients to cover them by about 3
inches. Cook gently at a simmer for about 1 hour or more. The liquid
in the beans should be mostly absorbed by the time they finish
cooking and the beans shoul dbe very moist and succulent. Do not let
them go dry. Add the salt to taste.  Serve the beans hot, drizzled
with olive oil; they are equally good at room temperature.

Sautee the shrimp in the olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper for
about 2 minutes, stirring often. Do not overcook. Serve the shrimp
with warm beans or slightly chilled with room temperature beans.

Note:  Adding salt to beans before they are fully cooked toughens
them.

Serves 6 to 8.

NOTES: The beans are delicious without shrimp. They make a tasty
accompaniment to roast or grilled meat, fowl or fish. If you increase
the amount of cooking water, you an have a delectable baean soup.

Fernadina Shrimp Gravy (Florida Cooking)

sauces, seafood

1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon plus 1 cup water
2 oz salt pork, diced
1/2 cup minced onion
1/2 cup diced green bell pepper
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
1/2 cup diced celery
1 1/2 lb shrimp, shelled, cleaned,- and, if; large, cut in- pieces
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon crushed dried red pepper
2 cup hot cooked rice

In a heavy medium-size skillet, stir the sugar over moderate heat

In a large skillet or saute pan, cook the salt pork until browned,
stirring now and then.  Remove the pork bits with a slotted spoon,
and set aside. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of pork drippings. Add
the onion, green and red peppers, and celery.  Saute until the
vegetables are tender. Add the shrimp and cook until they turn bright
pink and are opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the shrimp and vegetables
with a slotted spoon and keep them warm on a plate.  Add the
remaining 1 cup water and 1 teaspoon of the caramel to the pan
drippings. Bring to a boil, stir, and simmer 1 to 2 minutes. Season
with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper.

Return the shrimp and vegetables and the salt pork bits to the gravey

Filet De Vivaneau Sauce D'algues

fish

1 tablespoon olive oil
2  medium carrots, chopped
1  small onion, chopped
1/2 cup minced fresh mushrooms
2 lb fish scraps
1  lobster head
1  bouquet garni
2/3 lb fresh seaweed
1 1/2 quart water
1  salt
1  ground white pepper
2 tablespoon cornstarch (optional)
1/4 cup skim milk (optional)
4  3/4 in. red snapper fillets

* Fish scraps: Heads and bones of red snapper, turbot, sole or
halibut. ** Bouquet garni - a leek tied with parsley, whole cloves,
thyme, a bay leaf and whole peppercorns. Heat oil in heavy pot, add
carrots, onions and mushrooms and cook over medium heat for 2
minutes. Add fish scraps, lobster head, bouquet garni, seaweed and
water and simmer very slowly for 2 hours skimming off any scum that
forms on the surface. Strain fish stock through a fine sieve or a
strainer lined with a tea towel. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. If desired, blend cornstarch and milk together and stir into
stock. Cook gently until the sauce is thickened. Blend smooth in
blender or food processor. When ready to cook fish, preheat broiler
to hot and have rack 4 inched from heat. Oil grill and broil fish for
about 4 minutes, then turn and continue broiling for 8 - 10 minutes
or until fish flakes with a fork. Season with salt and pepper, serve
with hot sauce. You may bake fillets in a heavy pan instead. Spread
with some seaweed, arrange fish on top, pour 1 cup of sauce over
seaweed, cover and bake at 450 degrees for 8 - 10 minutes. Or, you
can steam the fish. Arrange as in baking, steam for about 8 minutes.
Christian Leveque, chef-proprietor of Restaurant Champs Elysees made
this low-fat sauce for grilled red snapper with a fish stock he
seasoned with seaweed. From The Gazette, 91/02/06.

Filets Of Sole Riviera

fish

3 large tomatoes
1  salt
12  4 filets of sole
1  milk
1/2 cup flour
1  freshly ground white pepper
3  eggs, lightly beaten
2 cup white bread crumbs
6 tablespoon oil
3 large green peppers, roasted, seeded & cu; t into strips
3 large red peppers, roasted, seeded & cut; into strips
1  freshly ground black pepper
4 tablespoon sweet butter
      ----ACHOVY BUTTER----
8 tablespoon sweet butter, softened
2 teaspoon anchovy paste
1 tablespoon lemon juice
      ----GARNISH----
6  rolled anchovy filets
1  quartered lemons
1  finely minced parsley

Do not peel the tomatoes; cut them into thick slices and sprinkle
them with salt.  Let them drain on a large plate for 30 minutes. Dip
the filets in milk. Dry them lightly with paper towels. Season the
flour with salt and white pepper; dip the filets in the seasoned
flour; transfer them to the beaten eggs and cover them well, then
coat them thoroughly with bread crumbs.  Place the filets on a large
platter and refrigerate for 1 hour. Twenty minutes before you plan to
serve, heat 3 T of olive oil in a large skillet; add the roasted
pepper strips. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes over high heat.  Season them
with salt and black pepper. Transfer them to a serving platter and
keep them warm. Set the pan aside. In another skillet heat the 4 T of
butter with 2 T of oil. Add the filets, two at a time, and saute them
over medium heat for 3 minutes. Turn them over carefully without
breaking through the coating and saute for 3 to 4 minutes more.
Regulate the heat so as not to burn the fat. While the sole is
sauteeing, add a little more olive oil to the pan in which you
sauteed the peppers. Add the tomato slices and cook them quickly
until they are heated through (about 2 minutes).  Remove the pan from
the heat. As soon as the filets are done, place them on the bed of
peppers. Top the filets with the tomato slices, decorated with the
anchovy filets. Surround the platter with quartered lemons and
sprinkle with parsley. In a small saucepan melt the softened butter
over very low heat; add the anchovy paste and lemon juice. Pour the
anchovy butter over the sole and tomatoes and serve immediately.

1/2 cup dry white wine
2  large red peppers *
1 tablespoon apple jelly
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1  salt, pepper

Fillet Of Steelhead Bonne Femme

seafood

1  head, tail, backbone of fish
4 tablespoon butter
6  peppercorns
1 cup hollandaise sauce **
2  shallots, sliced
1 1/2 tablespoon flour
1 cup water
4 tablespoon milk
1/3 cup white wine
1  salt and pepper
2 lb fillets of steelhead
1  cucumber and lemon slices
1  bouquet garni
1/4 teaspoon thyme,
1/2 teaspoon tarragon
1/2 lb mushrooms
      ----HOLLANDAISE SAUCE----
2  egg yokes
1  salt
1  fresh lemon juice
1 pinch cayenne
1/4 lb cold butter, 8 pieces

This lordly French dish is prepared in a variety of ways, but
basically it is fish fillets served with two sauces and mushrooms in
between. The fillets from small salmon, walleye, lake trout, and
channel cat are all superb prepared in this fashion.
If the two sauces seem too time-consuming just note that this dish
is excellent if only the wine sauce is used.

Put the fish head, etc., peppercorns, and shallots into the water and
wine, bring to a boil, then simmer gently for 30 minutes. Strain and
set aside.
Arrange the fillets in a shallow glass or earthenware fireproof
dish that has been liberally buttered. Add the bouquet garni.
Pour in the reserved fish stock and poach in a 325 degree oven for
20 minutes.
Saute the sliced mushrooms in 2 tablespoons of butter for 5 minutes,
coating and stirring a couple of times. Reserve.
Prepare the hollandaise and hold it by covering with a lid.
Make the wine sauce by melting 2 tablespoons of butter in pan, then
stir in the flour and cook a few minutes. Turn off heat, pour in the
liquor from the poached fillets, then stir and thicken over the fire.
Add the milk, then stir until it bubbles. Season to taste.
To assemble: lay the fillets on a fireproof dish and cover with the
wine sauce.  Now dot the top with mushrooms. Ladle the hollandaise
sauce over all and glaze under the broiler.
Garnish with cucumber and lemon slices or with watercress.

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE

In a very heavy pot set over a flame tamer, whisk the eggs until they
are well blended, turn lemon-colored, and start to thicken. Be sure
heat is low. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice when thickening starts.
Start adding butter one piece at a time, whisking each piece until
is absorbed with the eggs.  Continue until all the butter is used up.
It should take about 2 minutes, at which point the sauce will be
thick. If at any point you sense that the is about to separate,
quickly add a teaspoon of cold milk or cream.
Now whisk in about 1 more teaspoon of lemon juice, a pinch of salt,
and optional cayenne.  Taste to see that the sauce is lemony enough
for your taste.

Filleted Trout With Macadamia Nuts & Fried

seafood

4 tablespoon butter
1  splash of dry white wine
2  trout filleted
1/4 cup fish stock, or half clam
1  juice, half water
1  salt and fresh pepper
1/4 cup macadamia nuts, sliced
3 tablespoon heavy cream
1  oil for deep frying
1/8 teaspoon tomato sauce
2 tablespoon capers

A very special way a doing trout fillets, inspired by a dish created
by chef Seppi Renngli at the Four Seasons. In a skillet large enough
to hold the fillets melt about 3 tablespoons butter and, when almost
sizzling, add trout.  Saute on one side for about 3-minutes, turn,
cover for a minute, and then saute the other side. A total of 6-7
minutes should do it.
Salt and pepper the fish and remove to a warm place, add nuts for a
moment to the pan to toast, then toss over the trout fillets.
Meanwhile, in a separate small, sturdy pan, heat enough oil so that
a small strainer can be lowered into it.
Let capers drain in the strainer.
Returning to the trout pan, splash in tablespoon or two of wine,
then add stock and cream and boil down rapidly, stirring in just a
taste of the tomato paste and a little more butter. When reduced and
slightly thickened, spoon this little bit of pan sauce over the
fillets.
Now quickly lower the capers into the almost smoking oil. Let them
sputter and sizzle a few seconds, then remove the strainer and shake
free of oil.  Distribute fried capers in neat piles at either end of
the fillets and serve immediately.
