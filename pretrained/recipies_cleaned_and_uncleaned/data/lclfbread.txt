Basic Bread Machine Recipe

breads, breadmachine, low fat

2 3/4 teaspoon yeast
1 teaspoon malt
11 oz water (110 - 120 deg.f)
3 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup unbleached white flour
2 tablespoon sugar, honey, molasses...
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon gluten

put yeast and malt into machine with several oz. of water. Use a
thermometer for the water. Too hot will kill the yeast. The yeast
will now proof (start to multiply) In a separate bowl, measure out
all dry ingredients and mix. After a few minutes, yeast should be
bubbling, add dry stuff and any liquids including the water. start
the machine and see how it looks. If too dry, add until it looks
right. Should be one big mass not several. Flour:  I often substitute
1 cup of corn or rye + 1 heaping T of gluten for a cup of WW flour.
For sweet breads, add another few T of sugar (I commonly use honey,
molasses, or malt powder) and may some raisins. 3 T of carroway seeds
or sesame seeds in a non sweet bread is great. I have also added 2
mashed bananas, then cut the water.

Home Made Bread

breads, low fat

1 1/2 lb strong [bread] flour, either
1  white or wholemeal
1  [wholewheat]
1  as preferred
1/2 pkg instant dried yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1 large pinch salt
1  warm water to mix

Mix flour, yeast, salt and sugar, then add enough water to make a
fairly firm dough.  Knead vigorously until dough is smooth and
elastic - you can do this in a food processor, but it is very
therapeutic to do it by hand! Place in a clean bowl, cover, and leave
in a warm place for about an hour, or until doubled in size. Knead
again, then place on a greased, floured oven-proof plate.  Cover, if
possible with an oven- proof bowl, and leave for ten-fifteen minutes.

Bake in a hot oven (mark 7, 200 C, 425 F) for about 40 minutes, or
until it sounds hollow when tapped underneath. This doesn't keep well
as it has no fat, but that is seldom a problem!

Ileen's Brown Bread

breads, low fat

1 quart warm water
6 tablespoon instant potato flakes
6 cup stone-ground whole wheat
1  flour
4 cup stone-ground rye flour
2 cup steel-cut oatmeal
2 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup oil
1/2 cup molasses
1 tablespoon salt
3 large eggs, beaten
1  egg mixed with 1 tbsp water
1  for glaze
1  sesame seeds or wheat germ

Combine the flours & oatmeal.  Set aside. Whisk together potato
flakes in warm water.  Add yeast, stirring until dissolved. Add the
oil, molasses & salt.  Beat in 4 cups of the flour mixture until
smooth. Cover & let proof 20 -30 minutes or til light & bubbly. Stir
down the sponge & add the eggs. Gradually add sufficient flour
mixture to make a soft, workable dough that pulls away from the sides
of the bowl. Turn out onto a floured surface & knead 8 - 10 minutes
until smooth & resilient. Place the dough in a warm, buttered bowl,
turning to coat the top. Cover loosely with plastic wrap & a towel
and let rise until doubled, about 1 - 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down the dough & turn out onto a floured surface. Divide into 4
equal portions.  Knead each piece, cover & let rest 10 - 15 minutes.
Butter four 8 1/2" loaf pans. Form the dough into loaves & place in
the pans. Cover & let rise until just curved over tops of pans, about
30 -40 minutes. Brush the loaves with the glaze & sprinkle with seeds
or wheat germ.

Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Let cool on wire racks.

Jumbo Popovers***Npfn03a

breads, low cal

2 each eggs
1 cup non-fat milk
1 cup sifted flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

Butter 6 six-oz. custard cups with straight sides (popovers rise
better in straight-sided container). Beat eggs slightly with rotary
beater; add other ingredients. Continue beating briskly 1 to 2
minutes. Mixture will be smooth and thin.
Pour into custard cups, about 1/2 full. Place cups on cookie sheet,
not touching. Cook at 400 for 50 minutes or until puffed up and
golden brown (do NOT peek until they are done - this may cause them
to fall!) 110 calories per popover.

Lemon Pepper Popovers

breads, low fat

1 cup flour, unbleached white
1 cup skim milk; at room temp
1 tablespoon olive oil, extra virgin
1/4 teaspoon salt; or to taste
1/2 teaspoon black pepper; coarsely ground or cracke
2 teaspoon lemon rind; freshly grated
3 each egg whites; lightly beaten

*Anne's note:I'd omit the salt to reduce the sodium

"These delicious popovers take advantage of lemon's strong affinity
with freshly ground black pepper. They rise best in baked in deep
molds in a very hot oven. One of the best ways to grate lemon peel is
to remove the zest in strips using a vegetable peeler, then grind it
to a powder in a spice mill."

Preheat oven to 450F. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl and gradually
whisk in the milk. Add the remaining ingredients, whisking just to
mix. The mixture should be the consistency of heavy cream. If
necessary, add more milk. Grease popover molds or muffin cups with
vegetable oil spray or a little olive oil. Fill each mold 1/2 full.
Bake for 15 minutes without opening the door. Reduce heat to 375F and
continue baking for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the popovers are
browned. Unmold and serve at once.

Lowfat Applesauce Cinnamon Rolls - Abm

breakfast, low fat, abm, yeast bread

      ----DOUGH----
1 1/2 teaspoon yeast
4 cup bread flour
3/4 cup applesauce
1/2 cup nonfat milk
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup egg beaters
      ----FILLING----
1/4 cup applesauce
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1/2 cup walnuts; finely chopped,
1  ; optional
      ----ICING----
1 cup powdered sugar; sifted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon nonfat milk

Make dough in automatic bread machine on 'manual' or 'dough' cycle, and
'sweet bread' setting if you have it.

Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface.  Dough should be smooth and
elastic, and soft but not sticky.  If too sticky to handle, knead in a
small amount of extra flour.

Roll dough into a 9" square.  Spread 1/4 c. applesauce over the surface,
combine 1/3 cup sugar and the cinnamon and sprinkle over dough. Sprinkle
(optional) nuts evenly over dough (a few raisins would be nice also). Roll
up and seal seams.

Slice dough into 12 pieces.  Clean kitchen string or thread works best for
this; slip string under roll where you want the cut to be, cross ends over
top of roll and pull.  String will slice dough and cause less distortion
than trying to cut with a knife.

Arrange rolls, cut side down, in a pan sprayed with pan coating.  Let rise
in a warm place until nearly doubled (about 30 minutes).  Meanwhile,
preheat oven to 375 F.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden.

Mix powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla together for icing while rolls are
baking.  Remove from oven to serving dish and drizzle with icing.  Serve
warm.  OR, wrap airtight and freeze for up to 3 weeks; thaw and heat in
microwave at serving time on a plate lined with a paper towel or napkin.

Monkey Bread - Cooking Light *Jb

breads, desserts, low fat

2  loaves (1-pound) frozen white bread; dough
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup 1% low-fat milk
1 tablespoon reduced-calorie stick margarine
1 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1  vegetable cooking spray

1 Because the dough has a tendency to drip as it bakes, I usually put
a cookie sheet or aluminum foil underneath the Bundt pan. That way I
don't have to clean up a mess in the oven when the bread has finished
baking. -- Rita M. Newton, Waukon, Iowa

2 Thaw dough in refrigerator for 12 hours. Combine 1 cup sugar and
the next 4 ingredients in a small saucepan; bring to a boil, and cook
1 minute. Remove sugar syrup from heat; let cool 10 minutes.

3 Cut each loaf of dough into 24 equal portions. Combine 1/4 cup
sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a shallow dish; stir well. Roll
each portion in sugar mixture, and layer dough in a 12-cup Bundt pan
coated with cooking spray. Pour sugar syrup over dough; cover and let
rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 35 minutes or
until doubled in bulk.

4 Uncover, and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or until lightly
browned. Immediately loosen edges of bread with a knife. Place a
serving plate, upside down, on top of the pan, and invert bread onto
the plate. Remove the pan, and drizzle any remaining syrup over the
bread.

No-Knead Bread

breads, low fat

7 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
2 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 tablespoon molasses; unsulphered
4 cup water; warm

Recipe by: McDougall Plan Put flour in a large bowl. Place in a warm
oven for 30 minutes to warm flour and bowl to 110 degrees (1 1/2
minutes in microwave). Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water (110
degrees). Add molasses and mix well. Let rest about 3 minutes. Then,
add the yeast mixture and the remaining water (3 cups, warm). Mix
well by stirring or use one hand to mix in bowl. Do no Knead. Dough
will be sticky. Use non-stick pans or lightly oil two large loaf pan
(9"x5"x3"). Sprinkle with cornmeal. Spoon dough mixture into pans.
Smooth top with hand dampened with water to prevent sticking. Cover
with towel. Place in a warm spot. Let rise about 1 hour or until
dough reaches top of pans. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake for 20
minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees. Bake 30-40 minutes longer.
Remove pans from oven, tip pans on sides, and let cool on racks for
15 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and continue to cool before
storing. Bread is moist, so keep best in refrigerator.

HELPFUL HINTS: Recipe may be doubled to make four loaves. Refrigerate
or freeze extra loaves until ready to use. Other flours may be used
in place of 1.5 cups whole wheat, such as brown rice flour, garbanzo
flour, or barley flour. Use of nonstick pans is recommended. From the

Pocket Bread

breads, low fat

6 cup whole-wheat flour
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 cup water; very warm (120)

Recipe by: McDougall In a large bowl, mix 2 cups flour and yeast. Mix
the honey in the warm water. Add the water to the flour mixture and
beat for 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl
occasionally. (Or beat 150 strokes by hand.) Stir in enough flour to
make soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured board. Knead until
smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes, adding more flour if it is
too sticky. Place in bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until
doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, turn onto lightly
floured board. Cover, let rest 30 minutes. Divide dough into 10 equal
pieces. Shape each into a ball. On a lightly floured board, roll each
ball into a 6 inch circle. Place on a lightly floured baking sheet.
Bake on bottom rack of preheated 450 degree oven. Bake about 5
minutes. Tops will not be brown. To brown tops, place under broiler 3
inches from heat, for 1 minute. From the collection of Sue Smith,

1 1/2 teaspoon barley malt syrup; (1 tsp),
3/4 tablespoon wonderslim; (1 t), *
1 1/4 cup water; (3/4 c + 2 t)

Recipe by: The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever, Madge Rosenberg

* The original recipe called for 1 1/2 T vegetable oil for the lg loaf and
1 T vegetable oil for the sm loaf.

Note:  The measurements in the (...) are for the small
1 lb loaf

Triticale is a nutritious grain that is a hybrid of wheat and rye.
You can find it in most health food stores. It adds to the taste but
not much to the rising of bread. In combination with wheat flour, it
makes good bread for sandwiches or toast, with a pleasant but
unobtrusive flavor.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine
manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions.

2 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoon butter
1  egg
1 cup water; + 1 t

Recipe by: Dak recipe
I just made this bread using peanut oil instead of butter and it
probably is one of the best breads I've made. It had good flavor and
great texture. It sliced very well and didn't fall apart like the
bread can sometimes.

Whole Wheat Flour Tortillas

breads, low cal

1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 tablespoon warm water

Combine flours and salt.  Mix water and 2 ts oil, stir into flour
mixture to make a soft dough.  Divide dough into 12 even pieces.
Shape each into a small ball.  Coat palms with remaining oil.  Roll
each ball in oiled hands. Place in a bowl and cover with a cloth or
plastic wrap.  Let stand about 15 min.

Preheat an ungreased frypan.  Shape each ball into a very flat 4"
round patty.  Roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 6 in circle.
Cook each round on preheated frypan until bubbles form on top, and
underside is flecked with brown but not too crisp and still flexible.

Stack cooked tortillas, cover with a dry cloth towel.  Serve
immediately or reheat in 350F oven before serving.

Zucchini Bread

breads, low fat

1 1/4 cup oatmeal
3 cup flour
3 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoon grated orange peel
1/4 teaspoon salt
2  eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup applesauce
3 cup grated zucchini
2/3 cup sugar

In large bowl, mix together oatmeal, flour, baking powder,
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, orange peel and salt.  In separate bowl,
beat together eggs, sugar, vanilla, oil and applesauce.  Add dry
ingredients, mixing until blended.  Turn into 2 greased and floured
loaf pans.
Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 1 hour or until done.  Makes 2
loaves.

Zucchini is virtually effortless to grate on a hand-held cheese
grater, but even easier in a food processor fitted with a shredding
disk.  Drain shredded zucchini and let stand in a colander a few
minutes to allow moisture to drain away.
