      Title: Abalone Meuniere Mandarin
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      5    (7 1/2-ounce) cans Mexican
           -abalone
      8 oz Shrimp
      4 oz Fat pork
      4 oz Water chestnuts, minced
        pn Chives
           Ginger water, to taste (see
           -note)
           Salt and MSG
      1 oz Maize (corn) flour
      4 oz Chive and ginger oil
           -(see note)
      2 oz Flour
      3    Eggs, beaten
    5/8 oz Shaoxing wine
      6 oz Chicken stock
 
  The following four recipes are from a Chron article called "Foreign
  Intrigue" by Alice Cuneo that featured recipes from various
  consulates in the City.  This first one is from the Consulate of the
  People's Republic of China.  It's a sophisticated (but uncomplicated)
  banquet dish featuring abalone, shrimp and porkfat.
  
  Abalone stuffed with minced shrimp, from Shen Xuliang of the Chinese
  consulate.
  
  Trim the abalone, removing rough parts, and cut into flat rounds. Chop
  shrimp and fat pork to a paste consistency; stir in the water
  chestnuts, chives and ginger water.  Season with salt and MSG.
  
  Create the abalone "sandwiches" by spreading an abalone round with
  shrimp paste, then topping with another round.  Dredge "sandwiches"
  in maize flour and set aside.
  
  Heat chive and ginger oil in a wok over medium heat, swirling the oil
  to coat all sides of the wok.
  
  Dip the abalone "sandwiches" in the flour, then in eggs.  Fry in the
  hot oil until abalone is tender and golden.  Add Shaoxing wine,
  chicken stock, salt and MSG.  Bring to a simmer, adjust the
  seasonings and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTE:  Chive and ginger oil is oil in which chives and ginger have
  been cooked.  To make at home, heat 4 ounces oil in a wok set over
  medium heat. Toss in 1 or 2 tablespoons fresh snipped chives and 3
  slices fresh ginger. Stir-fry until fragrant, then proceed with
  recipe.  (Remove ginger slices before serving.)
  
  Ginger water is available in Chinese markets.

      Title: Adobong Pusit
 Categories: Filipino, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
    1/2 kg Small fresh squids
    1/2 c  Native vinegar
     10    Cloves garlic
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 md Onion, sliced
      2 md Tomatoes, chopped
           Extra salt and pepper for
           -seasoning
      1 ts Vet-sin (monosodium
           -glutamate)
 
  Got down my single Filipino cook book and found this little gem.  My
  grasp of Tagalog is non-existent but I'd guess that the name
  translates as "Squid Adobo".  At any rate, it's squid stewed in
  vinegar.  I assume that the reference to "native vinegar" refers to
  nipa sap vinegar (sukang paombong). The bottle I have is a milky
  looking vinegar that tastes pretty much like any vinegar so I imagine
  that you have some latitude on what type you can use.
  
  For those of you who have never tried it, Filipino food is an
  intriguing cuisine that has elements of Southeast Asian, Chinese and
  Mexican or Spanish influences.  It has everything from spring rolls
  (lumpias) to rellenos dishes.
  
  Wash the squids very well.  Remove the long thin membrane in the head
  and slit the eyes to bring out the ink.  Place the squids in a
  saucepan with vinegar, 6 cloves garlic crushed, salt and pepper.
  Cover and cook slowly until the squids are tender.  Cut cooked squids
  into 1/2 inch slices crosswise.
  
  Crush remaining garlic and saute in a little lard in another pan. Add
  the onion and tomatoes and cook until tomatoes are very soft.  Add
  the squids and the liquid in which they were boiled.  Simmer for 7
  minutes. Season with salt, pepper and vet-sin.

      Title: Agineres Me Avgolemono (Artichokes with Egg & Lemon Sauce
 Categories: Greek, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  The classic Greek sauce, avgolemono, is a great low-fat alternative
  to the melted butter, mayonnaise or vinaigrette dipping sauces
  usually served with artichokes.
  
  Snap the stems off four large artichokes and trim the bases so that
  they will sit upright on a plate.  Boil a potful of water to which
  you have added the juice of a lemon and a pinch of salt.  Drop the
  artichokes in and boil for 30 minutes or until they are tender.  Test
  by pulling off an outer leaf and trying the flesh at the base for
  tenderness.
  
  Meanwhile, in another saucepan, bring a cup of chicken stock to the
  boil. In a cup, mix about two-thirds of a tablespoon of cornflour
  with a little water until it is smooth and add to the boiling stock,
  stirring until it thickens.
  
  Separate 3 eggs, beat the whites until they hold stiff peaks, then
  add the yolks and continue beating tin the whole mass is fluffy.
  Still beating, add the juice of a lemon and pour in the boiling
  stock.  Pour this mixture back into the stock saucepan, and stir it
  over a low heat for a couple of minutes.  It must not boil.
  
  Place the artichokes in the centre of warmed plates and pour the
  avgolemono over them.  Serve.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings

  ROASTED RICE POWDER (THINH) Roasted rice powder is used as a
  flavoring and binding agent in various recipes throughout this book.
  It is necessary to soak the rice first in order to obtain a deep
  golden color after roasting. Soaking also makes the rice easier to
  grind. 1/2 cup raw glutinous rice Soak the glutinous rice in warm
  water for 1 hour.  Drain. Place the rice in a small skillet over
  moderate heat.  Toast the rice, stirring constantly with chopsticks
  or a wooden spoon, until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes.
  Transfer the roasted rice to a spice grinder or blender and process
  to a fine powder (the powder should resemble saw dust). Sift the
  ground rice through a very fine sieve into a bowl. Discard the grainy
  bits. Store the rice powder in a tightly covered jar in your
  refrigerator and use as needed.  It will keep for up to 3 months.
  Yield: 1 cup. SCALLION OIL (HANH LA PHI): Many Vietnamese dishes
  require this delicate scallionflavored oil. Brushed over noodles,
  barbecued meats, vegetables or breads, it complements each item. 1/4
  cup peanut oil, 2 scallions, finely sliced Heat the oil in a small
  saucepan until hot but not smoking, about 300F.  Remove the pan from
  the heat and add the sliced scallions.  Let the mixture steep at room
  temperature until completely cooled. This oil mixture will keep
  stored in a tightly covered jar at room temperature for 1 week.
  Yield: 1/4 cup CRISP FRIED SHALLOTS (HANH KHO PHI): This is an
  important ingredient in his many dishes throughout this book. Use as
  specified in recipes. 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup thinly sliced
  shallots Heat the oil in a small saucepan until hot but not smoking,
  about 300F. Add the shallots and fry over moderate heat until crispy
  and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Do not overcook.  Immediately
  remove the shallots with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
  Reserve the oil for another use. Cooked this way, shallots can be
  stored in a tightly covered jar on the kitchen shelf for up to 1
  month.  Yield: about 1/3 cup. ROASTED PEANUTS (DAU PHONG RANG): Use
  shelled and skinned unsalted peanuts for this purpose.  Cook a small
  amount at a time and use shortly after they are roasted to preserve
  their flavor. Amounts are specified in recipes using roasted peanuts.
  Place the peanuts in a skillet over moderate heat and cook, stirring
  constantly, until the nuts turn golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Allow
  to cool. Pound in a mortar with a pestle or process in a spice
  grinder until the peanuts are a bit chunky. Store-bought
  dry-roasted-roasted unsalted peanuts may be substituted in recipes
  calling for roasted peanuts. PEANUT SAUCE (NUOC LEO): This delicious
  sauce originated in the central region and is used as a dip for many
  dishes in this book.  Usually, tuong, a fermented soybean sauce, and
  glutinous rice are used to produce this sauce. After several
  experiments, I ended up with this variation where tuong and glutinous
  rice are replaced by hoisin sauce and peanut butter, ingredients that
  are more readily available. 1/4 cup roasted peanuts, ground, 1
  tablespoon peanut oil, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 1 teaspoon chili
  paste (tuong ot tuoi), 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1/2 cup chicken
  broth or water, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, 1/4
  cup hoisin sauce, 1 fresh red chile pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
  Prepare the roasted peanuts. Set aside. Heat the oil in a small
  saucepan.  When the oil is hot, add the garlic, chili paste and
  tomato paste, Fry until the garlic is golden brown, about 30 seconds.
  Add the broth, sugar, peanut butter and hoisin sauce and whisk to
  dissolve the peanut butter.  Bring to a boil, Reduce the heat and
  simmer for 3 minutes. Divide the sauce among individual dipping bowls
  and garnish with the ground peanuts and sliced chile. Serve warm or
  at room temperature. Yield: About 1 cup. VEGETABLE PLATTER (DIA RAU
  SONG): Vietnamese meals include an abundance of fresh lettuce, herbs,
  unripe fruits and raw vegetables.  These are arranged attractively on
  a platter and are used for wrapping cooked foods at the table,
  usually dipped in Nuoc Cham and eaten out of hand. The following
  herbs, both very important to the Vietnamese, would be authentic
  additions to the Vegetable Platter: One is the "saw leaf herb"
  (Eryngium foetidum, or ngo gai in Vietnamese), a coriander relative.
  The other is polygonum (P. pulchrum or rau ram in Vietnamese), with
  pinkish stems, pointed green leaves and purplish markings.  They can
  be found occasionally at Southeast Asian markets. If you have access
  to unripe mango, banana, papaya or apple and star fruit (carambola),
  add them to the platter. You may select or substitute the ingredients
  according to availability and personal taste. 1 large head of Boston
  or other soft lettuce, separated into individual leaves, 1 bunch of
  scallions, cut into 2 inch lengths, 1 cup coriander leaves, 1 cup
  mint leaves, 1 cup fresh Asian or regular basil leaves, 1 cucumber,
  peeled in alternating strips, halved lengthwise and sliced thinly
  crosswise, 4 ounces fresh bean sprouts On a large platter,
  decoratively arrange all of the ingredients in separate groups. Use
  in recipes where required. Yield: 4 to 6 servings

  grind until a fine meal is formed++the flour will prevent the nuts
  from turning oily.  Add remaining rice flour, the baking powder, salt
  and 2 teaspoons of the poppy seeds; process briefly.
  
  Combine yogurt, water, whole egg, egg white and oil in a 2-cup
  measuring cup.
  
  With processor motor running, pour liquid ingredients through feed
  tube over flour mixture, processing just long enough to mix.
  
  Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Sprinkle with remaining poppy
  seeds, and bake for 55 minutes.  Turn out onto a rack to cool.
  (Bread slices best after several hours, or the next day).
  
  Makes one 18-ounce loaf (18 slices).

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 oz (1/2 cup) ground almonds
      2 tb (2 1/2 T) ground rice
    1/2 pt (1 1/4 cup) milk
      2 tb (2 1/2 T) sugar
      1 ts Gelatin
 
  Here are a couple of recipes for almond pudding.  There are lots of
  variations of this dish some using dairy products, some using gelatin
  and some using agar agar and some combining them.  It IS good!  This
  first one is more "from scratch".  The second uses almond extract.
  
  Mix the almonds and rice in a bowl with 2 pints (5 cups) cold water,
  cover and leave for 2 hours.  Strain through a fine muslin into a
  large bowl. Add milk and mix well.
  
  Stand the bowl in a large saucepan with enough boiling water to come
  halfway up the sides of the bowl.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  Add the sugar, stir well and leave to cool slightly.  Mix the gelatin
  with 2 tablespoons (2 1/2 T) hot water until dissolved.  Stir into
  the milk mixture when almost cold.  Mix well and pour into a shallow
  serving dish. Leave until set.

      Title: Amazu Shuga (Pickled Pink Ginger)
 Categories: Japanese, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
 
    1/3 lb Fresh, Young, Ginger root*
    1/3 c  Rice Vinegar
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
           *Large pieces, pref. with
           -pinkish skin, scraped
 
  Whilst poring over my three volume loose leaf cookbook (inhabited
  mainly by stuff snatched from here) I ran across the following that I
  though you might be interested in.  I think that the caveat about
  fresh, young ginger root is necessary to this recipe.  I don't think
  the older, woody stuff would work at all.  Guess this originally
  appeared here from the heading...
  
  Using a sharp knife or a Beriner cutter,shave ginger root into paper-
  thin slices.  In a small, airtight container, combine vinnegar, sugar
  and salt. Blanch ginger for 30 seconds in boiling water.  Drain
  ginger; cool. If desired, reserve liquid for cooking purposes.  Add
  cooled ginger to vinegar mixture; mix well.  Store marinating ginger
  in the refrigerator. Pickled ginger can be eaten after 24 hours of
  marinating. It will keep several weeks.  Good with either Sushi or
  noodles.  Add marinade to salads or sauces.

      1 sm Eggplant
      2 lb Beef brisket, trimmed of
           -excess fat
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1    Onion, finely chopped
      1 tb Minced fresh ginger
      1 tb Minced garlic
    1/2 ts Crushed red pepper
      6    Star anise
      3 tb Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Dry sherry
      2 c  Beef broth
      3 tb Dark molasses
           Salt and pepper, to taste
      8    Dried black fungus (tree
           -ears)
      1    Tomato, finely chopped
      4    Scallions, sliced
      1 ts Asian sesame oil
 
  Here, beef brisket takes on an Asian flare.  Slices of meat are
  braised in an aromatic stock seasoned with star anise, soy sauce,
  ginger, garlic, red pepper and dark molasses.  As a final step,
  pureed eggplant is stirred in, for flavor and thickening.
  
  Pierce the eggplant several times with the tines of a fork.  Place in
  a preheated 400F oven and roast for 3 minutes, or until shriveled and
  soft. Set aside.  Slice the brisket against the grain into 1/4-inch
  thick slices.
  
  Heat the oil in a large wok or large deep skillet.  When it begins to
  smoke, add half of the beef and cook, stirring, until browned.
  Remove and set aside.
  
  Add remaining beef, and cook, stirring until browned.  Remove and set
  aside.  Add the onion, ginger, garlic, crushed pepper, star anise and
  soy sauce to wok and stir-fry for 10 seconds.
  
  Return beef to wok, along with the sherry, broth and molasses.  Stir
  to blend and season with salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer over low
  beat for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until the beef is tender.
  
  While beef is cooking, soak fungus in hot water to cover.  When
  swelled and softened, drain and rinse well; set aside.
  
  Cut the stem end from the cooked eggplant.  Split in half lengthwise
  and scoop the flesh into a food processor or blender.  Puree.
  
  Add eggplant, drained fungus and tomatoes to beef and cook for 5
  minutes longer.  Stir in scallions and drizzle with sesame oil. Serve
  with rice, if desired.

      Title: Apricot Upside Down Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Text Recipe
 
  Another of my scores this weekend was "from SOUP to DESSERT with the
  NEW Irradiated PET MILK".
  
  That's a book title believe it or not.  It's copyrighted 1934 by Pet
  Milk company.  I was naturally curious as to why they were nuking Pet
  Milk in 1934.  That screwed up my historical perspective pretty good,
  but it turns out that "irradiated" refers to running the milk under
  an ultraviolet light to increase vitamin D content, not making it
  glow in the dark. So once my reality check had subsided and I paged
  through the book, I saw this which made me think of you.
  
  1. In a 9-inch skillet melt 3 tablespoons butter.
  
  2. Remove from heat and sprinkle with 1/2 cup brown sugar.
  
  3. Arrange on sugar 24 canned apricot halves.
  
  Let stand while mixing batter.
  
  4. Beat until very light 2 eggs.
  
  5. Add, while beating, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.
  
  6. Heat to boiling point:  1/4 cup Pet Milk diluted with 1/4 cup
  water and 1 Tbl shortening.
  
  7. ea Beat into egg mixture.
  
  8.  Sift together:  1 cup sifted cake flour and1 tsp baking powder.
  
  9. ea Add milk mixture beating quickly but thoroughly.
  
  10. lb over apricots.
  
  11. ea Bake in a moderate oven (350F) for 25 to 30 minutes or until
  cake shrinks from sides of pan.  Turn out while warm and serve with
  Whipped Pet Milk Topping.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  That's all pretty straight forward.  What it shows in the pictures
  but not in the text is that the cake is baked in a cast-iron skillet
  like a nice mess of cornbread.
  
  Here's the topping though I can't help but think it's a tad redundant.
  
  WHIPPED PET MILK (as a topping):
  
  Soak for 5 minutes:  1/4 tsp granulated gelatin in 1 tsp cold water.
  Scald in top of double boiler:  1/2 cup Pet Milk. Add gelatin and
  stir until dissolved.  Pour into bowl and chill until icy cold.  Then
  whip with rotary beater until stiff.
  
  Fold in 1 Tbl powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.
  
  Makes about 1 1/2 cups...Serves 8.
  
  NOTE:  The following flavorings may be substituted for the vanilla: 2
  t orange extract 1 t lemon extract 1/2 t almond extract and 1/2
  teaspoon lemon extract 1/2 t peppermint extract 4 dr oil of peppermint

           Text Only
 
  Simple ethnic recipes, unchanged for generations, often have an
  authority that the latest food fashions cannot begin to match.  The
  following Greek lemon lamb dish is a case in point.  Faithful to its
  frugal origins. this recipe works equally well with cheap cuts like
  lamb shanks. breast of lamb or best end of neck.  If you do use these
  fattier meals, make the dish a day ahead, refrigerate it and remove
  the fat that coagulates on top. if anything, the dish gains added
  depth of flavour when made ahead and reheated.
  
  Trim skin and ail excess fat from a boned shoulder or leg of lamb.
  Squeeze enough lemons to provide 1/3 cup of juice.  Open out the meat
  and rub both inside and outside surfaces with some of the lemon juice
  and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.  On the inside surface of the
  meat, sprinkle a teaspoon of dried oregano or 1/2 a tablespoon of
  chopped fresh oregano. Roll the meat up and tie securely.
  
  Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pot large enough to take the roll
  comfortably and brown the meat on all sides.  Turn the heat down to
  low and add to the pot the rest of the lemon juice, 2 cloves of
  garlic, crushed, and another teaspoon of dried oregano or 1/2
  tablespoon of fresh.
  
  Cover the pot and simmer very gently, turning occasionally, for about
  2 1/2 hours, till very tender.  If you like, add small new potatoes
  to the pot about an hour before serving.
  
  To serve, remove the string and slice the meat into the centre of a
  heated serving platter.  Surround with potatoes and pour lemony
  juices over the meat.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

  This, too, is a Portuguese recipe++from the Algarve.
  
  It can be made with octopuses of any size.  Baby ones won't need so
  much precooking.
  
  Precook 600 to 800 g octopus in 200 mL red wine with a little water.
  
  The octopus will exude liquid so that you are likely to end up with
  more cooking liquid at the end.
  
  Retain this and add water to make it up to 600 ea mL. Cut the drained
  octopus into small pieces.
  
  Heat 150 mL olive oil in a large saucepan, add a chopped onion and
  cook gently, stirring, for 2 or 3 minutes.  Add 2 garlic cloves
  finely chopped, 3 tomatoes, skinned and chopped, and a large green
  pepper cut into snips. Season with salt, pepper and chilli powder to
  taste.  Cook for a few minutes longer.
  
  Add the cooking liquid from the octopus and bring it to the boil. Add
  350 g rice (preferable a short-grain risotto rice like arborio) and
  bring back to the boil, then turn the heat very low and put the lid
  on the saucepan. After 15 minutes, stir to ensure the rice is not
  catching on the bottom of the saucepan.  In 5 minutes more, taste a
  grain or two to make sure it is soft.  The rice should still be quite
  damp.
  
  Serve.

      Title: Artichoke Information
 Categories: Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  The Aussie recipes I've been posting are from "Raw Materials", a
  column written by Meryl Constance for the Sydney Morning Herald.  In
  each column she zeros in on a particular foodstuff, tells a bit about
  its uses and history and then presents recipes utilizing it.  Nice
  format.  Since I really like the style and content of the food
  sections that Mark sent over I'm posting her whole column on
  artichokes rather than just the recipes so folks here can get a feel
  for it.  Here's the introductory material. The recipes follow in the
  next three posts.
  
  Globe artichokes are among the most beautiful of vegetables - witness
  their frequent appearance in still-life paintings.  And for fineness
  of flavour and texture, they rank alongside that other luxury
  vegetable, asparagus.
  
  Yet fresh artichokes are greatly underused in this country and many
  people are only acquainted with the inferior tinned version, which is
  about as much like the real thing as tinned asparagus is like fresh.
  Globe artichokes are in season now and well worth seeking out.
  
  Besides their culinary virtues, they have health-food status, being
  low in kilojoules (about 90 kJ per I 00 g) and a source of various
  vitamins and minerals.
  
  At present, they cost about 60c to 80c each, though Raw Materials
  recently saw some magnificently fat specimens for $2 each in
  Leichhardt, where the Italian community knows how to appreciate them.
  They are said to have originated in Sicily and certainly they were
  developed into their modern form by Italian growers.
  
  Botanically, globe artichokes are thistle buds.  Choose tightly furled
  artichokes which are as fat as possible.  They will keep for a few
  days in the fridge, lightly wrapped in plastic, and even better if
  their stems are in water.  Before use, they should be soaked upside
  down in a sinkful of water to remove any dirt or insect residents.
  
  Australians' underuse of artichokes probably has a lot to do with
  lack of knowledge about how to deal with them and a vague idea that
  it is a complex matter with traps for the unwary.
  
  The trap, of course, is the aptly-named choke, a hairy inedible
  portion lurking at the heart of the vegetable, at the centre of the
  leaves and on top of the succulent base.  Provided you know not to
  try eating it, it's no problem.
  
  Another daunting factor is the instruction, given in so many recipe
  books, to snip off the top third of each leaf - fiddly and
  unnecessary (unless you chance across the rare spinella variety,
  which is cone-shaped and has a little thorn at the tip of each leaf).
  
  When artichokes are served whole, plainly boiled and with a dipping
  sauce, as an entree, there is no need to trim the leaves at all.  In
  fact, to do so dims their beauty as an object on the plate.  The
  diner pulls away each leaf by the tip, dips the base in the sauce and
  draws the base of the leaf through the teeth to scrape off the meaty
  flesh there. Used leaves are piled to one side until all have been
  detached.  Then it is just a matter of removing the choke with a
  spoon or knife, before enjoying the best part of all, the base.  The
  whole process is a little ritual.
  
  But many artichoke recipes are less reverent and are designed to let
  the diner eat the whole vegetable with no mucking about.
  
  For these, it's just a matter of slicing off the whole top of the
  vegetable, leaving between a half and two thirds.  Discard a couple of
  layers of the tough outside leaves and tidy up the base (leave as
  much as you can).  If the artichokes are to be halved or quartered,
  it is easy to see and remove the choke.  If they are to be served
  whole, pull and cut out the innermost leaves and open out the centre
  so that you can scrape out the fibrous white choke with a teaspoon.
  
  Cut surfaces of an artichoke blacken very quickly, so immediately rub
  them with a lemon and drop the artichoke pieces into water acidulated
  with lemon juice (or vinegar at a pinch) until you are ready to deal
  with them. Don't cook them in aluminium or they will go black
  immediately.

      Title: Asparagus Crab Soup (Sup Mang Tay Cua)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 1/2 qt Water
      2 lb Pork bones
      2 ts Salt
      1 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
      2    Shallots or
      2    Scallions, chopped white
           -part
    1/2 lb Crab meat, fresh, frozen,
           -or canned
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 ts Cornstarch dissolved in
      2 tb Water
      1    Egg
      1 cn (15 ounces) white
           -asparagus, undrained
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh coriander
           -(Chinese parsley)
    1/4 c  Chopped scallion greens
 
  The French introduced asparagus to the Vietnamese, who promptly
  incorporated this classic vegetable into their cuisine.  The
  Vietnamese word for asparagus is "Western bamboo," due to its
  resemblance to bamboo shoots. asparagus is universally popular
  throughout Vietnam, this light, tasty dish will delight your family
  as well.
  
  Bring water to a boil and put the pork bones in.  Remove the scum,
  then cover and continue to boil the bones for 1 hour.  Remove the
  bones from the stock and discard.  Add the salt and the fish sauce to
  the stock.
  
  Heat the oil and add the chopped garlic and shallots; add the crab
  meat and fry for 5 minutes over high heat.  Sprinkle with 1/8
  teaspoon of black pepper, stirring constantly, then add the crab meat
  mixture to the soup and bring to a boil.  Add the
  cornstarch-and-water mixture and stir for a few minutes.
  
  Break the egg open and drop it into the actively boiling soup while
  stirring.  Cook, still stirring, for about 2 minutes, then drop in the
  asparagus, along with the liquid from the can and the rest of the
  black pepper.  Continue to cook until the asparagus is heated through.
  
  Sprinkle the coriander and scallion green over the soup before
  serving.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings.

      Title: Asparagus and Crab Meat Soup (Mang Tay Nau Cua)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 c  Chicken broth
      1 tb Plus 2 teaspoons nuoc mam
           -(Vietnamese fish sauce)
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      6    Shallots, chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped
      8    Ounces lump crab meat,
           -picked over and drained
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Cornstarch or arrowroot,
           -mixed with
      2 tb Cold water
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
     15 oz White asparagus spears *
      1 tb Shredded coriander
      1    Scallion, thinly sliced
 
  * cut into 1-inch sections with canning liquid reserved
  
  This soup was probably created by some homesick Frenchman.  White
  asparagus (a French import), packed in jars or cans, is used for this
  recipe. Traditionally, crumbled, salted duck egg yolk is added to
  season the soup.
  
  If white asparagus is unavailable, use frozen or fresh asparagus (in
  this case, add the fresh asparagus to the broth from the very
  beginning and cook until tender, before adding the remaining
  ingredients).
  
  Combine the broth, 1 tablespoon of the fish sauce, the sugar and salt
  in a 3 quart soup pot.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer.
  
  Meanwhile, heat the oil in a skillet.  Add the shallots and garlic and
  stir-fry until aromatic.  Add the crab meat, the remaining 2
  teaspoons fish sauce and black pepper to taste.  Stirfry over high
  heat for 1 minute. Set aside.
  
  Bring the soup to a boil.  Add the cornstarch mixture and stir gently
  until the soup thickens and is clear.  While the soup is actively
  boiling, add the egg and stir gently.  Continue to stir for about 1
  minute. Add the crab meat mixture and asparagus with its canning
  liquid; cook gently until heated through.
  
  Transfer the soup to a heated tureen.  Sprinkle on the coriander,
  scallion and freshly ground black pepper.
  
  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

      Title: Authentic Southern Style Barbecued Ribs (Secret Recipe)
 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
MMMMM------------------------SECRET SAUCE-----------------------------
      1    Bottle ketchup, 32 ounce
           -large size (Heinz is my
           -favorite)
    2/3 sm Jar prepared yellow mustard
           -(ie. French's)
    1/2 lb Dark brown sugar
    1/3 lg Onion, chopped coarsely
      3 tb Distilled white vinegar
      2 lg Lemons, sliced
           Tabasco hot sauce to taste
           -(3 drops to 1/2 ts)
           Ground black pepper to
           -taste (lots of it)
           No salt (plenty in the
           -ketchup)
 
  Preparation time:  1/2 day, but constant attention is not required.
  
  Simmer the sauce, stirring until the sugar is melted.  Then, stir
  occasionally for a few minutes while the oil is drawn out of the
  lemon. Do not allow to scorch.  Remove from heat and set aside.
  
  Broil the ribs flesh side up until browned.  Turn and cook flesh side
  down, brown again.  Now brush both sides with some of the sauce and
  cook on each side for five minutes.  Do not let them burn or blacken!
  The RIBS at this point look good, but they are still raw.
  
  Cut the ribs apart and dip each rib in the sauce.  Pile the ribs high
  on a full-sized oven broiler rack and pan, and pour any remaining
  sauce, less a cup or so, over the ribs.
  
  Cover the ribs with heavy-duty aluminium foil, tucking in around the
  outside edge of the pan to make an airtight container. Cook in the
  oven at 325F for 2 hours.
  
  Remove from oven and open very carefully.  Beware the live steam that
  will rush out.  Allow to sit, opened for a few minutes.
  
  The end result is smoked, steamed, tender meat which falls from the
  bones. All fat is rendered and drains into the pan.
  
  Use leftover sauce when warming over the second day.
  
  SAUCE VARIATION: Molasses, tomato paste, onion, spices
  
  Unfortunately I don't have anyplace to grill outdoors so can first
  part of the recipe (which calls for outdoor grilling) be substituted
  by putting the ribs in the oven?
  
  Rinse and dry ribs; then cut apart.  Heat about 3 cups oil in a wok.
  When very hot, add ribs in small batches and fry until brown and
  crispy, about 5 minutes.  Remove and drain.
  
  [They are absolutely delicious at this point.  Once I forgot to make
  the sauce until I was half done eating the ribs!  They're great
  served at this point with various Chinese dips ++mustard with a dish
  of chopped scallions, hoisin sauce, chili sauces, etc.  S.C.]
  
  Combine sugar, vinegar, salt and soy sauce.  Remove oil from wok;
  return wok to stove and turn heat to high.  When hot, add vinegar
  mixture. Cook, stirring, over high heat until syrupy.  Add ribs; toss
  in the mixture until well coated.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  San Francisco Chronicle, date unknown...
  
  I have never tried that, but I suspect a compromise could be worked.
  Most of the actual cooking occurs during the oven portion.  The
  purpose of the outdoor grilling is to both sear and seal the meat,
  and impart the unique flavor of barbecue to the ribs by exposing it
  to the smoke created when the drippings from the meat vaporize on the
  hot briquets.  An additional (and desirable) flavor is also imparted
  to the meat if real charcoal briquets are used.
  
  The addition of the "Secret Sauce" during the last portion of the
  outdoor phase also contributes to the taste.
  
  As a non-outside alternative, I would suggest oven broiling of the
  ribs as a substitute for the outdoor searing.  During the final
  portion, the coating of the slabs could still be done (the 5 minutes
  per side part).
  
  To possibly aid in giving a barbecue-like flavor, a drop or two of
  liquid smoke could be added **only** to the small portion of the
  sauce that is used to coat the ribs during the searing process.
  There's a possibility the time under the broiler may need to be
  shortened when compared with the outside method.
  
  Liquid smoke is a very potent ingredient, and I have never found it
  satisfactory for my own use.  Obviously, some must, as it is still
  sold. As a rule of thumb, I would advise forgetting about the amount
  recommended for use on the bottle, and if in doubt, "use less". Then,
  following the oven broiling, you can continue by cutting the ribs
  apart, and continuing by the recipe.

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 lb Smoked whitefish
      2 lg Ripe avocados
     12    Strips of fresh red bell
           -pepper or canned
           -pimiento **
 
  * the yolks rubbed through a sieve and the whites finely chopped.
  
  ** each cut about 1/4 inch wide and 2 inches long.
  
  In a deep bowl, mash the egg yolks and milk together with a spoon or
  table fork until they form a smooth paste.  Add 1 tablespoon of the
  lime juice, the sugar and the salt.
  
  Then beat in the vegetable oil, a teaspoon or so at a time; make sure
  each addition is absorbed before adding more.  Add the olive oil by
  teaspoonfuls, beating constantly.  Stir the remaining lime juice into
  the sauce and taste for seasoning.
  
  With your fingers or a small knife, remove the skin from the fish and
  pick out any bones.  Drop the fish into a bowl and flake it finely
  with a fork. Add the chopped egg whites and the sauce, and toss
  together gently but thoroughly.
  
  Just before serving, cut the avocados in half.  With the tip of a
  small knife, loosen the seeds and lift them out.  Remove any brown
  tissue like fibers clinging to the flesh.
  
  Spoon the fish mixture into the avocado halves, dividing it equally
  among them and mounding it slightly in the center.  Arrange 3 strips
  of sweet pepper or pimiento diagonally across the top of each avocado
  and serve at once.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: Avocado with Crab
 Categories: Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      4    Ripe avocados
     15 oz Crab meat or
      1 lb Fresh crab meat
      8    Tb mayonnaise
      4    To 6 drops Worcestershire
           -sauce
    1/2 c  Finely minced, peeled
           -celery stalks
           Salt, depending on the
           -saltiness of the crab meat
      1 pn White pepper
      1 pn Cayenne or
      1 dr To 2 drops Tabasco
      1    Head iceberg lettuce
      2    Lemons
 
  1.  Split the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pits.  With a
  melon-ball cutter, gently enlarge the cavity toward the stem end.
  
  2.  With a fork, mash the avocado pulp which was removed.
  
  3.  Mix the pulp with 4 tbs. of the mayonnaise, salt if needed,
  pepper and cayenne or Tabasco.  Gently fold in the crab meat and the
  celery.
  
  4.  Divide the crab mixture among the eight avocado halves.
  
  5.  Mix the Worcestershire sauce with the remaining 4 tbs.
  mayonnaise. With a pastry bag or a cone made from wax paper, pipe
  approximately 1/2 tbs. of the mayonnaise mixture on each filled
  avocado half.
  
  6.  Remove the outside leaves of the iceberg lettuce.  Arrange the
  leaves on a serving platter.  Cut the inside part of the lettuce into
  very thin strips and make 8 small nests on the leaves lining the
  serving platter. Place an avocado half on each nest.
  
  7.  Cut each lemon in quarters and garnish the serving platter with
  the slices of lemon.  Serve.  If desired, offer additional mayonnaise
  separately.
  
  CHEF'S SECRET:  When you buy avocados, they should not be soft but, if
  pressed gently, should give about the same resist-ance as an orange.
  Once at home, pack each avocado in a brown paper bag and leave them
  at room temperature overnight.  Of course, chill before serving.
  
  If you use canned crab meat, it is advisable to pick it over.
  Sometimes you may find a small piece of the shell.  Definitely taste
  it for saltiness. Certain brands improve with a quick rinsing with
  water.
  
  If you have to rinse it, don't do it under the faucet.  Place the
  meat in a sieve and dip the sieve in a small amount of water.  Loosen
  the meat with one finger, then remove the sieve from the water and
  shake the meat dry. The flavor will not be destroyed, but the
  saltiness of the canning liquid will be gone.
  
  Enlarging the cavity of the avocados with a melon-ball cutter has two
  purposes; you have the subtle taste of the pulp in the crab mixture,
  and it is easier to arrange the filling without making it messy.
  
  Definitely peel the celery stalks for this dish with a potato peeler
  so that no strings get into the salad.  The celery is needed for its
  crunchy texture to counterbalance the softness of the avocado and
  mayonnaise and the fleshy chewiness of the crab meat.  If you do not
  care for the taste of celery, you can substitute peeled, seeded,
  finely chopped cucumber.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

    1/2 c  Tamarind water
      1 tb Clear soya sauce

      1 ts Ground ginger
      1 ts Ground coriander
      1    Clove garlic, crushed

  The name means simply 'fried chicken', and that is all it is.  The
  marinade, however, gives it a characteristically Indonesian flavour.
  Marinate the pieces of chicken in this mixture for 2 hours, turning
  them from time to time. Strain the chicken, so that the marinade
  drips away from it.  Then deep-fry the portions, 4 or 5 at a time.
  Chicken fried in this way is excellent with Nasi Goreng.  [Nasi

      Title: Babi Kecap I (Pork Cooked in Soya Sauce)
 Categories: Indonesian, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 kg (1 1/4 lb) fillet of pork
           -or leg of pork
      1 tb Clear soya sauce
      2 tb Plain flour
    1/2 ts Powdered ginger
     20 g  (4 oz) button mushrooms
      4    Cloves garlic
      1 sl Of root ginger, about 2 cm
           -(1") across and 1/2 cm
           -(1/4") thick
      3 tb Dark soya sauce
           Pepper or a pinch of chilli
           -powder
      2 tb Boiled water
      2 tb Medium dry sherry or rice
           -wine (optional)
      2 ts Lemon juice
      6 tb Oil or pork fat
 
  This, as its name suggests, is pork cooked in soya sauce.  It is a
  particular favourite with my own husband and children, who always
  know when it is about to appear on the table because the ginger and
  garlic frying in the sauce smell so deliciously savoury.
  
  Cut the pork into small cubes.  Put the flour into a bowl and add the
  clear soya sauce and ginger powder, mixing them well together.  Coat
  the pork with the mixture and then let it stand for at least 30
  minutes.
  
  Clean and slice the mushrooms.  Peel the garlic and ginger and slice
  them very thin; you can use these thin slices as they are, or cut
  them again into very tiny sticks.
  
  Heat the oil or fat in a wok or thick frying pan and fry the meat,
  half of it at a time, turning it from time to time, for 5 minutes.
  
  Repeat the process for the remaining half of the meat.  The flour that
  coated the meat will tend to stay in the pan or stick to the bottom
  of it, but leave it there-it will thicken the sauce later.  Now take
  most of the oil out of the pan, leaving only about two tablespoons
  which you then heat again.  In this, fry the tiny slices of garlic
  and ginger and the mushrooms, stirring continuously, for i minute.
  Add the soya sauce, the water and the meat. mix well, season with
  pepper or chilli powder, and stir continuously for 1 or 2 minutes.
  just before serving, add the sherry or rice wine and the lemon juice.
  Serve hot.
  
  This dish keeps extremely well in the freezer, and it is worth making
  a large quantity from, say, half a leg-of pork, which is much cheaper
  than buying pork fillet.  If you are going to freeze your Babi Kecap,
  however, do not add the sherry or lemon juice at the time of cooking.
  To serve from the freezer, thaw the meat out completely and heat
  quickly on a high flame for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring or shaking the
  pan well all the time. Add the sherry or rice wine and lemon juice
  just before serving.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
    500    Pork
    1/2 ts Pepper
           Salt
      1    Onion
      2 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Sambal Oelek (hot pepper

      5 tb Sweet soy sauce (Ketjap
           -Manis)
    150    Water
           Margarine or Oil
 
  There are quite a few pork dishes in the book (including another
  version of this one).  Evidently minorities are well enough
  represented that pork has earned a place in the cuisine of
  predominantly Muslim Indonesia. I think this would be excellent done
  with 1 inch long pieces of baby back ribs. I also won't stew it as
  long as I did++or maybe use bigger chunks of pork. I used pieces
  between a half and a quarter inch on a side and the meat got a tad
  dried out.  No complaint on the taste though! I'll also toss in a
  couple of scallions cut into one inch chunks just before it's done
  stewing. I was out of sambal oelek so I used some tuong ot toi cut
  with a little lime juice.  Worked good.
  
  Dice Pork, rub in salt and pepper and fry in hot oil or margarine.
  Then add the finely sliced onions, spices and the hot pepper
  condiment.
  
  After this add the water and the soy sauce.  Bring to the boil and
  simmer for at least half an hour until the meat is done.
  
  Serve Babi Ketjap on a large plate, garnish with sliced tomatoes and
  chopped vegetable pickles.  Eat with plain or savory rice or Mei.

  For those who aren't familiar with it, Kecap Manis (or ketjap manis)
  is a thick, sweet Indonesian soy sauce that does wonderful things for
  meat and poultry as a marinade/BBQ sauce as well as a condiment.

      2    Chinese crullers, sliced
           -(Optional)
           Steamed white rice
 
  I think the only "Singaporean" dish I have is one for a curried
  noodle dish known as Singapore Noodles every where in Asian except
  Singapore where they never seem to have heard of it.  Stay tuned
  though. I'll see what I can come up with.
  
  Well, it's a little later and we're in luck!  I found three Singapore
  recipes in Joyce Jue's "Asian Appetizers".  Here's da foist...
  
  Although most Asian lunches and dinners include a soup, there are
  certain soups which are served as a snack or even for breakfast.  In
  Singapore, one of my favorite ways to start a day is to trek over to
  a hawker's stall and have a bowl of pork rib "tea" (actually a clear
  soup tinted with soy sauce).  It comes with Chinese crullers for
  dunking, and a strong black tea which I think of as the "espresso" of
  teas.  This recipe comes from the Straits Cafe in San Francisco.  The
  crullers, baguette-shaped fried savory pastries, may be purchased at
  better Asian markets.
  
  1.  Combine the pork, garlic, and water in a large saucepan; bring to
  a boil and cook for 5 minutes.  Skim and discard the scum from the
  surface. Add the cinnamon, star anise, peppercorns, sugar, salt, and
  soy sauce. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the pork is
  tender, about 45 minutes.  Discard the excess fat from the soup
  before serving.
  
  2.  Serve the soup in deep bowls with 3 to 4 rib pieces per serving
  and shallot flakes scattered over the top.  Combine soy sauce and
  chiles to taste in small bowls as a dipping sauce for the ribs.
  Serve with cruller slices for dunking into the broth, and a bowl of
  rice on the side.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
  
  CRISP FRIED SHALLOT AND GARLIC FLAKES:
  
  Cut 8 shallots or garlic cloves crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices;
  you should have 3/4 cup of slices.  The slices must all be of equal
  thickness to assure even cooking.  Heat 2 cups of vegetable oil to
  300F in a preheated wok, saucepan, or skillet.  Add the slices and
  fry slowly for 3 to 5 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.  They
  should be completely dry with no remaining moisture.  Remove with a
  fine strainer and drain on paper towels.  When cool, store in an
  airtight container. The flakes will keep for several weeks.  Makes
  about 1/2 cup.
  
  Makes about 1/2 cup.
  
  NOTE:  The flavored oil can be strained and used for stir-frying.

  gorgeous deep reddish orange in color.  I imagine that this would be a
  great recipe to use on chicken wings.  And they'd definitely be hot++
  check out the amount of sambal oelek, the Indonesian condiment made
  of crushed bird's eye chilies, garlic and vinegar.  I'm making this
  tomorrow with a hacked up chicken and a double recipe of the
  marinade.  I'll start marinating it tonight.  It would probably be
  great with a game hen as well. Stay tuned++a report will follow.
  
  1:  Cut quail in half through centres.  Combine garlic, sambal oelek,
  honey, sauce, sugar and oil in bowl, add quail, stir well; cover,
  refrigerate overnight.
  
  2:  Just before serving, place quail on rack over baking dish, bake in
  moderate oven for 15 minutes, increase temperature to hot, cook
  further 10 minutes or until quail are crisp and tender.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
  
  Quail can be prepared 2 days ahead.
  
  Storage: Covered, in refrigerator. Freeze: Uncooked quail suitable.
  Microwave: Not suitable.

  Here's an old time idea that's probably "Mid-Western" enough for ya.
  This is something I picked up from my ex-Mennonite Grandmother in
  Hutchinson, Kasas.  Take four nice thick pork chops and brown 'em on
  each side. Dice up four or so slices of stale bread++or bread dried
  out in the oven. Mix that into a can or so of creamed corn.  How many
  cans you need will vary with the brand of corn.  Add about half a
  chopped up yellow onion and a couple of beaten eggs.  Mix the mess
  well and add salt an pepper to taste. Put the browned chops in a
  greased baking dish, pour the corn mixture over the chops and pop 'em
  in a 325F oven for about an hour. The corn topping should come out
  browned and fairly dry and the chops should be nice and succulent
  with a hint of sweetness from the corn. This is one dish that garlic
  will absolutely ruin!  I've tried all sorts of ways to fancy up this
  dish but have never been successful in improving the original simple
  recipe. And there's not ONE squid tentacle in the whole mess! Posted

      Title: Banana Ketchup
 Categories: Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 c  Golden raisins
    1/3 c  Coarsely chopped onions
      2 lg Garlic cloves
    1/3 c  Tomato paste
  1 1/3 c  Cider vinegar
      4 lg Very ripe bananas, peeled
           -and cut into chunks
      3    To 4 cups water
    1/2 c  (packed) dark brown sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
      2 ts Ground allspice
    3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    3/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      2 tb Dark run
 
  I've never tried this but I suspect that it's quite similar to the
  Filipino Jufran and Mafran sauces that I love so much.  They're made
  from bananas also and taste like catsup *should* taste.
  
  Combine the raisins, onions , garlic, tomato paste and 1/3 cup
  vinegar in the container of a food processor., Process the mixture
  until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a large, heavy saucepan.
  
  Add the banana chunks and another 1/3 cup vinegar to the food
  processor container.  Process the mixture until smooth.  Transfer the
  banana mixture to the saucepan.  Add the remaining 2/3 cup vinegar, 3
  cups water, brown sugar, salt and cayenne pepper.
  
  Bring the mixture in the saucepan to a boil over medium-high heat,
  stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and cook the ketchup,
  uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/4 hours.  If the ketchup
  threatens to stick to the bottom of the pan at any point, add some of
  the remaining water, up to 1 cup.
  
  Add the corn syrup, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper and cloves to
  the ketchup.  Cook the ketchup over medium-low heat, stirring
  frequently, for 15 minutes longer, or until it is thick enough to
  coat a metal spoon. Stir in the rum.  Remove the ketchup from the
  heat and let it cool a few minutes.
  
  Force the ketchup through a fine sieve to strain it, pressing down
  hard on the solids.  Remove the ketchup from the heat and let it cool
  to room temperature.  Store the banana ketchup, covered in the
  refrigerator for up to 1 month.
  
  Makes about 3 1/2 cups.

      Title: Barbacoa Mexicana (Barbecue From Mexico City)
 Categories: Mexican, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Lamb, cut into pieces *
           Maguey leaves
           Ingredients for Barbecue
           -Consomme
 
  * backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs, and head
  
  To further explore the international links of various cuisines, check
  out this one and remember a few months back when we were talking abou
  the Pacific Island custom of cooking in pits.  I didn't realize that
  the Mexicans also had such a practice.  Here's a series of recipes
  revolving around Mexican Barbacoa or BBQ.
  
  To be very authentic, use a lamb which has been slaughtered the day
  before the cookout and hung overnight.  On the day of the big event,
  the animal is split into sections:  backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs,
  and head.
  
  METHOD:
  
  We assume that no one would tackle this kind of barbecue without a
  large number of guests-the kind who really like to pitch in.  So, the
  first thing to do is to set one group of your guests to digging a
  hole about four feet by two feet across.  Other members of the party
  can scout up kindling and others can be set to work cleaning each
  maguey leaf.
  
  Once the hole is dug, it is plastered with mud to keep the walls firm.
  Large porous stones should then be placed in the bottom of the pit
  (beware of little hard rocks; they'll split open).  Over the stones
  put enough dry wood to fill the pit, then set fire to the wood and
  let it burn to the smokeless coal stage.  While the fire is burning
  down, the maguey leaves should be toasted until limp, for this will
  enable them to release precious juices needed to season the meat.
  
  When the fire has burned down sufficiently, line the pit with the
  maguey leaves, making sure that all of the mud is covered so meat
  will not stick to pit.  The leaves should be suspended vertically,
  the tips overlapping all the way around and held down with stones for
  the moment.
  
  The next step is to lower a grate into the hole and on it place the
  casserole with soup ingredients.  On top of the uncovered casserole
  ingredients, arrange the lamb pieces, starting with the backbone,
  then the legs, shoulders, rib sections, and the head.  Do not salt
  meat before it is cooked, for this can toughen it.
  
  After meat is in the pit, fold the tips of the maguey leaves into the
  hole to cover the meat well.  Over this place a metal sheet to keep
  any earth from seeping into the pit and then seal the pit with a coat
  of fresh mud and build a large fire over the metal sheet and mud
  cover.
  
  Keep the fire blazing for 5 or 6 hours, depending upon the age of the
  meat. Open the pit, salt the meat before serving it, and accompany it
  with Salsa Borracha*.   The broth is served in small cups.
  
  *  See Shepherd's Roast with Drunken Sauce for recipe.

      Title: Barbecued Pig's Tails
 Categories: Mennonite, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2    Dozen pigs' tails
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Tomato sauce
    1/4 c  Tomato paste
    1/4 c  Brown sugar or syrup
           -[Maple, perchance? S.C.]
      2 tb Wine vinegar
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
           Juice of 1 lemon
      1    Clove garlic, finely chopped
      1 ts Dry mustard
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper to taste
    1/2 ts Rosemary (optional)
 
  We attribute this recipe to the Mennonite colony of Ontario.  It's
  often served at picnics and is known as one of the favorite foods at
  stag parties.
  
  Prepare pigs' tails according to Step I in basic instructions; cut in
  3-inch pieces.  Place pigs' tails on a rack and bake in a 300F oven
  for 2 to 3 hours, until meat is tender and most of the fat has baked
  off. An alternate method to this is to simmer the pigs' tails in
  acidulated water for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Combine all other ingredients for barbecue sauce, coating tails well.
  Grill over hot charcoal, turning and basting, until crisp.  If fresh
  rosemary is available, break off several branches, tie them together
  and use as a basting brush.  For barbecuing, we prefer leaving the
  tails uncut or halved so as to have fewer piece to constantly turn.
  
  Serve with traditional barbecue accompaniments such as corn-on-the-
  cob, French bread and green salad.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

      Title: Barbecued Squid
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 lb Squid, cut into rings
           Lemon-garlic butter [posted
           -in another post. S.C.]
 
  Serve this with a Thai sweet/hot chili sauce.  Had it like that in
  Bangkok and it was one of the best meals I had there.
  
  This recipe sounds too easy to be true.  It isn't.  As with any
  grilled seafood, the fresher the ingredients and the simpler the
  cooking, the better the end result.  Barbecued squid and an anise
  flavored aperitif like Pernod, ricard, ouzo or raki, make a wonderful
  combination. Make a fire, preferably with firewood or Mexican
  charcoal, started from paper and kindling.  Skewer the squid.  When
  coals are red hot, barbecue the rings for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or
  until they are brown.
  
  Some recipes for grilled squid suggest marinating them.  I omit this
  procedure because it adds flavor at the expense of softening the
  flesh. Serve hot with lemon-garlic butter.
  
  NOTE:  Commercial charcoal and lighter fluid are petroleum products.
  They impart an oily flavor to food.  Hardwood, or Mexican charcoal, a
  commercial product, which is made by burning down mesquite, both give
  a nice flavor and are certainly less toxic than petrochemicals.
  Mexican charcoal is available in Northern California through Lazzari
  Fuel Company, San Francisco.

      Title: Barbecued Squid with Hot Dipping Sauce (Squid Sate)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Squid, cut into rings
      1 c  Coconut milk
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
      6 tb Fish sauce
      3 tb Peanuts, finely chopped
           Juice of 1 lime
           Cayenne to taste
      1 ts Sugar
 
  No country of origin, but I'm betting on Vietnam this time, mainly
  from the dip.
  
  Coconut milk is easily made if you have a blender or food processor.
  
  Boil 1 1/2 cups water.  Pour it over 1 1/2 cups of fresh or dry grated
  coconut.  Beat it in the food processor or blender for at least 1
  minute. Strain it through a sieve or through cheesecloth.  Marinate
  the squid for 1 hour in coconut milk to which you have added the
  garlic. Prepare the coals and skewer the squid.
  
  To make the dipping sauce which makes this dish so distinctive,
  combine the fish sauce, peanuts, sugar, lime juice and the cayenne.
  
  Grill the squid for about 3 minutes on one side.  When brown, turn
  over and barbecue 3 minutes more.
  
  Serve accompanied by the dipping sauce.
  
  This recipe will produce tasty grilled fish if you use firm varieties
  such as swordfish, sea bass or halibut, cutting the steaks or fillets
  into large squares.
  
  This dish serves 4 to 6 as part of a larger meal.

      4    Ounces pork fat
      4 ts Nuoc mam

           Peanut Sauce
           Vegetable Platter
      8    Ounces 6 1/2-inch rice
           -paper rounds (banh trang)
     12    Piece fresh sugar cane, or
     12 oz Sugar cane packed in light
           -syrup, drained
     12    8-1/2 ea inch bamboo skewers
           -soaked in water for 30

           Vegetable oil, for shaping
           -shrimp paste
      8    Ounces extra-thin rice
           -vermicelli
 
  The allied recipes for this rather complex operation follow in the
  next post. Although this dish can be baked in an oven, I strongly
  suggest you grill it over charcoal, for the result is far superior.
  The dish may be prepared over 2 consecutive days.  On day one,
  prepare the dipping sauce and condiments.  The Vegetable Platter and
  shrimp paste can be assembled the following day. Fresh sugar cane may
  be obtained at Caribbean markets; canned sugar cane is available at
  Asian grocery stores. Prepare the roasted rice powder, scallion oil,
  crisp-fried shallots and roasted peanuts. Set aside. Shell and devein
  the shrimp. Sprinkle the salt over the shrimp and let stand for 20
  minutes.  Rinse the shrimp thoroughly with cold water. Drain and
  squeeze between your hands to remove excess water.  Dry thoroughly
  with paper towels.  Coarsely chop the shrimp. Boil the pork fat for
  10 minutes.  Drain and finely dice. In a food processor, combine the
  shrimp, garlic, shallots and sugar. Process until the shrimp paste
  pulls away from the sides of the container, stopping as necessary to
  scrape down the sides.  The paste should be very fine and sticky. Add
  the pork fat, roasted rice powder, fish sauce and black pepper to
  taste to the processor. Pulse briefly, only enough to blend all of
  the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate. Meanwhile, prepare the Peanut
  Sauce and Vegetable Platter. Cover the rice papers with a damp towel
  and a sheet of plastic wrap; keep at room temperature until needed.
  Peel the fresh sugar cane; cut crosswise into 4-inch sections. Split
  each section lengthwise into quarters. (if using canned sugar cane,
  split each section lengthwise in half only, then thread 2 pieces
  lengthwise onto a skewer.) Pour about 1/4 cup of oil into a small
  bowl.  Oil your fingers. Pick up and mold about 2 tablespoons of the
  shrimp paste around and halfway down a piece of fresh sugar cane.
  Leave about 1 1/2 inches of the sugar cane exposed to serve as a
  handle. (If using canned sugar cane, there is no need to leave a
  handle. The skewers will serve as handles.) Press firmly so that the
  paste adheres to the cane. Proceed until you have used all the shrimp
  paste. Prepare a charcoal grill or preheat the oven to broil.
  Meanwhile, steam the noodles, then garnish with the scallion oil,
  crisp-fried shallots and ground roasted peanuts. Keep warm.  Pour the
  peanut sauce into individual bowls and place the Vegetable Platter
  and rice papers on the table. Grill the shrimp paste on the sugar
  cane over medium coals, turning frequently. Or Broil, on a baking
  sheet lined with foil, under the broiler, about 6 inches from the
  heat, for 3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer to a
  warm platter. To serve, each diner dips a rice paper round in a bowl
  of warm water to make it pliable, then places the paper on a dinner
  plate.  Different ingredients from the Vegetable Platter, some
  noodles and a piece of the shrimp paste, which has been removed from
  the sugar cane, are added.  The rice paper is then roiled up to form
  a neat package.  The roll is dipped in the Peanut Sauce and eaten out
  of hand. The remaining sugar cane may be chewed. Note: If both types
  of sugar cane are unavailable, use skewers.  Shape the shrimp paste
  into meatballs and thread 3 or 4 on each skewer. Yield: 4 to 6
  servings. From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart,

      Title: Basic Pita
 Categories: Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      2 c  Warm water (90 to 100
           -degrees F.)
      2    Envelopes active dry yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      5    To 5 1/2 cups unbleached
           -all-purpose flour, plus
           -flour for kneading
 
  Pour the water into a large bowl, sprinkle in the yeast and stir to
  dissolve.  Stir the sugar and salt into the yeast mixture thoroughly
  with a wooden spoon.  Gradually add 5 cups of the flour, stirring
  constantly until the dough is smooth.  Slowly work in the remaining
  flour with your hands, kneading until the dough is no longer sticky.
  Turn the dough out onto a well floured board and knead until smooth
  and elastic, about 5 minutes.
  
  Shape the dough into an even rectangle and cut in half, lengthwise.
  Divide each half into 12 portions for small pitas, 6 for larger ones.
  
  Shape each into a smooth ball.  Place balls on a floured surface and
  cover them with a slightly damp towel while you roll out one at a
  time. Gently press each ball flat with your fingers, keeping it well
  rounded. Flour a work surface and a rolling pin.  Roll each round
  from the center to the outside edge, giving the dough a 1/4 turn
  after each roll, to form a perfect circle not quite 1/4-inch thick (5
  to 5 1/2 inches in diameter for small pitas; about 8 1/2 inches for
  larger ones).
  
  Carefully flip the circles over to smooth out any creases that might
  prevent the pockets from forming.
  
  Fifteen minutes before the loaves have finished rising, preheat the
  oven to 500F and place an ungreased baking sheet in the oven to heat.
  As each bread is rolled, place it carefully on a floured surface and
  cover with a clean, dry towel; do not let the surfaces dry out, and
  let rise in a warm, draft-free area for 30 to 45 minutes.
  
  To bake, place 4 small pitas or I large one on the hot baking sheet.
  Bake on the bottom rack of the oven until puffed and lightly browned
  on the bottom, almost white on top, about 4 minutes for small pitas
  and about 3 1/2 minutes for large; the pita will be soft and
  flexible.  If desired, flip the loaves over after they have puffed
  and bake for up to 1 minute longer to brown tops; be VERY careful not
  to let pita get crisp and brittle.
  
  Remove hot pitas from oven and wrap immediately in clean, dry towels
  until cool enough to handle.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
  Repeat baking process until all breads are baked.
  
  Makes 24 small or 12 large pitas.

  1 1/4 c  Warm water (110 degrees F.)
      2 ts Honey
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Olive oil
           About 3 1/2 cups unbleached
           -flour
 
  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the 1/3 cup warm water.  Let it proof
  until puffy, about 10 minutes.
  
  Stir together the yeast mixture, remaining warm water, honey, salt,
  olive oil and 1 cup of the flour in a large mixing bowl.  Whisk until
  blended. Add remaining flour, a little at a time.
  
  Turn out the dough onto a floured board and let rest for 5 to 10
  minutes while you wash the bowl and rub it with a few teaspoons of
  olive oil. Then knead dough for 3 minutes.  Place dough in bowl and
  turn to coat it well with the olive oil.  Let rise for about 1 hour,
  or until doubled in bulk.
  
  Punch down dough.  At this point you may form the pizzas, or
  refrigerate the dough for several hours, well wrapped in plastic so
  it won't dry out. (Although a refrigerator rest is not necessary, it
  makes the dough easier to handle.)
  
  Makes enough dough for two 12-inch pizzas, or two 10-inch thick-crust
  pizzas.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Information Text
 
  One or both of these first two steps is required in all the recipes
  that follow.
  
  Step I: Cleaning
  
  Remove any hairs on heads, feet, tails, ears or snouts by singeing
  over an open flame or plucking.  Scrub well (using a vegetable brush
  if desired) and then sprinkle with salt, rubbing it into the skin.
  Rinse well with cool water; pat dry.  Remove any excess fat.  Poultry
  feet (chicken, duck or turkey) must be stripped of their outer scaly
  skin; plunge them in boiling water for 1 minute, as you would do
  before peeling tomatoes. Proceed with recipe.
  
  Step II: Parboiling
  
  Parboil in salted water (1 teaspoon salt for each quart water) for 5
  minutes.  Drain, discarding water.  This step serves the propose of
  ridding the meat of running blood as well as clinging meat, fat or
  bone residue, thereby adding clarity to sauces.

      Title: Basic Vegetable Platter
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
 
  2 cups soft lettuce leaves (Boston or similar; not iceberg} 1 cup
  fresh mint leaves 1 cup fresh coriander (Chinese parsley) 1 cup
  cucumber *
  
  * peeled in lengthwise strips and with green strips in between, then
  cut in half lengthwise and into thin horizontal slices, forming
  semi-circles.
  
  A salad or vegetable platter is a very important part of a Vietnamese
  meal; indeed, it is served at practically every one.  The vegetables,
  which are eaten along with many dishe, are arranged on a platter, and
  diner helps himself to whatever he desires.  In Vietnam we used many
  more vegetables and herbs than we can find in the West.  But, in
  spite of that, the following platter makes a satisfactory
  accompaniment to the dishes we have prepared for this book.  All
  vegetables and herbs are those served in Vietnam, except that the
  variety is smaller.
  
  Arrange a mound of lettuce in the center of a platter.  Around the
  lettuce, and touching it, arrange separate mounds of mint and
  coriander.
  
  Arrange the cucumbers in overlapping slices around the complete outer
  rim of the platter.
  
  This is the basic arrangement of the vegetable platter.  On those
  occasions when a recipe calls for another vegetable, it can be added
  to this platter.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: Beef Balls (Thit Bo Vien)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 60 meatballs
 
    1/4 c  Plus one tablespoon nuoc
           -mam (Vietnamese fish sauce)
      1 tb Plus 1 teaspoon potato
           -starch
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 lb Trimmed boneless beef hind
           -shank
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed
      1 ts Oriental sesame oil
           Vegetable oil, for shaping
           -meatballs
 
  A few weeks back there was some discussion of a Vietnamese meat ball
  soup that you had in a restaurant.  This is a recipe for beef meat
  balls that may be close to what you had.  Actually this seems to be
  more like a pate from the preparation.  I'm also posting a recipe for
  a Vietnamese pork pate that's delicious as well as a recipe for
  grilled dried beef. These crunchy little beef balls are very popular
  among the Vietnamese. They are served mainly as appetizers or added
  to noodle soups. Chili sauce (tuong ot) is the usual accompaniment,
  but any hot red pepper sauce can be served alongside.
  
  [Tuong ot is a paste made by smashing up hot red chilies and garlic.
  The Philippine "Sambal Oelek" or Thai Sriracha are good substitutes.
  S.C.]
  
  In a shallow dish, mix the fish sauce, potato starch, baking powder,
  sugar and black pepper.
  
  Slice the meat into 1/8-inch-thick pieces.  Add to the marinade and
  mix well.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
  Before proceeding, transfer the meat to the freezer for 30 minutes.
  Work with half of the beef at a time; do not overload the work bowl.
  
  In a food processor, combine half of the beef with half of the garlic
  and sesame oil.  Process to a completely smooth but stiff paste,
  about 3 minutes.  Stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the
  work bowl. The completed paste should spring back to the touch.
  Transfer the paste to a bowl.  Process the remaining beef, garlic and
  sesame oil the same way.
  
  Rub some vegetable oil on one hand.  Grab a handful of the meat paste
  and close your hand into a fist, squeezing out a small portion of the
  mixture, about 1 teaspoon, between your thumb and index finger.  Keep
  rolling and squeezing the same portion between your thumb and index
  finger until you obtain a smooth rounded ball.  Scoop out the
  meatball with an oiled spoon. Repeat until all of the paste is used.
  
  Pour 1 inch of water into a wok or wide pot.  Place a steamer rack or
  bamboo steamer over the water.  Arrange the meatballs without
  crowding in a single layer on the rack.  Cover and steam for 5
  minutes.
  
  Serve as an appetizer with chili sauce.  These beef balls can also be
  added to a well-seasoned beef broth, sprinkled with chopped scallions
  and black pepper and served as a soup (noodles may be added).
  
  NOTE:  These meatballs may be frozen.  Thaw them thoroughly, then
  steam or simmer in boiling water until just heated through.
  
  Yield: about 60 meatballs.

      Title: Beef Soup with Lemon Grass (Canh Thit Xao Sa)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      1    Stalk fresh lemon grass or
      1 tb Dried Lemon Grass
           Sprinkling of freshly
           -ground black pepper
      2 ts Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
      6 oz Fatty beef chuck, sliced
           -paper thin
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      2    Shallots or white part of 2
           -scallions, sliced
      3 c  Water
  1 1/2    Beef bouillon cubes
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Fresh coriander (Chinese
           -parsley), chopped
      2    Scallions, green part only,
           -chopped
 
  Here's a pretty simple Vietnamese beef soup recipe in contrast to the
  recipe for Hanoi Beef Soup.  It doesn't call for hot chilies, but you
  can slice a couple into thin rounds and toss 'em in.  That's kosher
  (if that term can apply...) with any Vietnamese soup.  Add 'em either
  when the soup is brought to it's final boil or just after it's
  removed from the heat.
  
  If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and
  upper two-thirds of the stalk, then chop.  If you are using dried, it
  must be soaked for 2 hours, then drained and chopped fine.
  
  Sprinkle the black pepper, 1 teaspoon of the fish sauce, and chopped
  garlic over the meat; mix well and allow the meat to absorb the
  flavors for a few minutes.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the shallots over a high flame.  Add the lemon
  grass and fry for about 1 minute, then add the meat.  Cook until all
  traces of redness are gone.  Add the water, bring to a boil, and add
  the beef bouillon cubes, remaining 1 teaspoon fish sauce, and salt.
  Immediately before serving, bring the soup to a boil.  Pour into
  bowls and sprinkle with the chopped coriander and scallion.

      Title: Berbere (Ethiopian Hot Pepper Seasoning)
 Categories: Ethiopia, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
    1/4 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Ground coriander
      2 tb Salt
    1/2 ts Ground fenugreek seeds
  1 1/4 c  Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
    1/2 c  Paprika
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 ts Fresh ground black pepper
 
  Here's the pepper seasoning used in Doro Wat.  I made the full amount
  and it makes a lot.  I used whole spices, ground, then toasted. This
  has a lot of potential as a basic seasoning.  I can easily see it
  being used in a curry or other kinds of stews.
  
  In a heavy saucepan, toast the following ground spices together over
  a low heat for 4 to 5 minutes:  ginger, cardamom, coriander,
  fenugreek, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and allspice.  Shake or stir to
  prevent burning. Add the salt, cayenne pepper, paprika and fresh
  ground black pepper and continue toasting and stirring for 10 to 15
  more minutes.
  
  Cool and store in tightly covered glass jar.  This will keep in the
  refrigerator for 5 or 6 months.
  
  Makes 1 1/2 cups.

      Title: Bibingkang Malagkit
 Categories: Thai, Rice, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 16 servings
 
      4    14-ounce cans coconut milk
  2 1/2 c  Glutinous rice
    1/2 c  Long grain rice
      4 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Brown sugar, packed
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Ground peanuts or pilli
           -nuts, optional
      3    Eggs beaten
 
  While wading through my pile of newspaper clippings I ran across the
  following gem.  I can't help but think that it might be even better
  if you used palm sugar instead of the brown sugar.  Never heard of
  "pilli" nuts++any idea what they are?
  
  Open cans of coconut milk without shaking.  Spoon off thick milk that
  has risen to top and measure 2 cups.  Measure 4 cups remaining
  thinner milk. Freeze any unused coconut milk.
  
  Mix glutinous and long-grain rice in a bowl.  Cover with hot water
  and let stand for 5 minutes.  Drain rice and turn into a heavy
  4-quart saucepan. Mix thin coconut milk, granulated sugar and salt
  with rice.
  
  Bring to boil, reduce heat to very low and cook, covered until rice is
  tender but not soft, about 30 minutes.  Turn rice into well-greased
  13- by 9-inch baking pan, flatten rice and smooth top; set aside.
  
  Mix thick coconut milk and brown sugar in a saucepan.  Add vanilla and
  nuts.  Cook and stir until sugar dissolves and syrup thickens, about 5
  minutes.  Gradually stir some of the hot mixture into eggs, then
  return to saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly
  thickened, about 1 minute.  Pour topping evenly over rice.
  
  Bake in a 375F oven for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool to room
  temperature.  Cut into squares to serve.
  
  Serves 16 to 20.

      Title: Black Beans in Spicy Tamarind Sauce
 Categories: Indian, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Mexican black beans
      2 cc Tamarind pulp (see note)
    1/3 c  Peanut oil
      2    Onions, chopped
      2 tb Grated fresh ginger
      2 tb Minced garlic
      1 ts Powdered hot red chile
           -peppers
      1 ts Freshly ground cumin
    1/2 ts Turmeric
      1 lg Ripe tomato, finely chopped
      2 ts Ground roasted cumin seeds
      1 ts Garam masala
           Salt to taste
      1 c  Chopped cilantro leaves
 
  Pick over and wash the beans.  Soak them overnight in cold water to
  cover.
  
  Soak the tamarind pulp in 2 cups hot water in a nonmetallic bowl for
  at least 1 hour.  Squeeze the pulp with fingers to extract as much
  juice as possible.  Strain, pressing the pulp.  Discard the residue
  and reserve the strained juice and pulp.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy, shallow pan.  Add the onions and cook,
  stirring frequently, until they turn almost reddish brown, 10 to 12
  minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for 5 minutes longer,
  stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan.  Add the
  chile pepper, cumin and turmeric, and cook for 10 or 15 seconds.
  Stir in the tomatoes and let them cook until they form a sauce and
  fat separates out.
  
  Drain the beans and add to the pan along with 2 cups water.  Cover and
  simmer until the beans are almost done.  Check the water level from
  time to time, and if the b@beans look dry, add small amounts of hot
  water.
  
  When the beans have finished cooking, there should be plenty of
  sauce. Stir in the tamarind, cover and simmer until the beans are
  very tender. Stir in the roasted cumin seeds, garam masala, salt and
  1/2 cup of the cilantro leaves.  Cover the pan and let rest for at
  least 10 minutes. Reheat and serve garnished with remaining cilantro
  leaves.
  
  NOTE:  Tamarind is available in cake form at Indian markets.

      Title: Black Bean Sauce Squid
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Squid, cleaned
           -Chinese-style (see below)
      2 tb Fermented, salted black
           -beans (available at Asian
           -groceries)
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 tb Rice wine, or 2 Tbs mirin
           -or sherry
      1 ts Ginger, grated
      2    Scallions, chopped into
           -1/2-inch pieces
      1    Tb regular soy sauce
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Cornstarch dissolved in
      1 tb Water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Many people shy away from dishes with names like Black Bean Sauce
  Squid because they think it involves the preparation of a complicated
  sauce. In fact it is quite easy.  The black beans themselves,
  fermented and salted when you buy them, are the sauce.  All you do is
  add a little rice wine to make a paste.  Then it's just like any
  other stir-fry++a couple of minutes of high-heat cooking,
  continuously stirring, and the dish is done.
  
  Prepare black bean sauce mixture by adding to the beans:  rice wine,
  soy sauce and sugar.  Let sit for 15 minutes.
  
  Saute garlic and ginger in the oil over medium heat in a heavy frying
  pan or wok until garlic is slightly browned.  Turn up heat.  Add
  squid and scallions.  Stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Pour in black bean
  sauce mixture, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add cornstarch and, when
  sauce thickens, remove from heat and serve.
  
  [Score squid diagonally at three quarter inch intervals.  Turn and
  repeat at right angles to original cuts.  Don't cut all the way
  through the squid body.  Cut each scored squid body into three or
  four pieces. When cooked, the squid will roll up and the
  crosshatching will catch and hold the sauce. It's much easier to do
  than to describe.  S.C.]

      Title: Blanched Gai Lan Dressed with Rice Wine and Oyster Sauce
 Categories: Chinese, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 tb Oyster sauce
      2 tb Chicken stock
      1 tb Shao Hsing wine, or dry
           -sherry
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
      1    To 1 1/2 pounds gai lan
           -(Chinese broccoli)
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Peanut oil
 
  Gai lan is Chinese broccoli.  It's not much like the Western stuff.
  It has thinner stems, flowers and leaves and is eaten more as a green.
  
  Combine the oyster sauce, chicken stock, Shao Hsing wine, sugar and
  sesame oil in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and cook until sauce
  thickens. Set aside.
  
  Wash the gai lan in cold water.  Trim off and discard the tough
  bottoms. Peel stalks if they are thick and tough; leave gai lan whole
  or cut into thirds.
  
  Bring 3 to 4 quarts of water to a boil in a wok or stock pot; add the
  salt and oil.  Add the greens, bring back to a second boil.  Turn off
  the heat and let greens stand for a minute or two.  When the green
  stalks brighten, test one for doneness.  It should be tender and
  crisp.  Drain immediately and shake off excess water.
  
  Transfer to a platter, pour dressing over, and serve immediately.

  I've never even tasted a blueberry, but this looks like a good
  introduction...
  
  For the pastry, cut 125 g softened mono-unsaturated margarine into
  250 g flour.  Add up to 70 ml cold water, roll the dough into a ball
  and leave in a cool place to rest for 15 minutes.
  
  Butter and lightly flour a 25 cm tall tin with a removable base. Roll
  out the pastry and line the tin.  Mix 20 g flour with 100 g caster
  sugar and spread it over the bottom of the pastry case.  Fill the
  case with 750 g blueberries and dot them with a total of 30 g of
  margarine. Bake in a preheated 240C oven for 25 to 30 minutes.
  
  Remove from oven, dust with 50 g icing sugar.  Serve warm.

 Categories: Mexican, Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 12 servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SPONGE--------------------------------
      3 tb Sugar
  2 1/2 c  Warm water (108F to 110F)
      1 tb Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
    1/4 c  Gluten flour

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
           Starter sponge (above)
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Very soft butter
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
  3 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
    1/2 c  Gluten flour (see note)
    1/2 c  Warm water mixed with 2
           -teaspoons salt
 
  The starter sponge:
  
  Whisk together all ingredients until well blended.  Cover with
  plastic wrap or a damp towel, set in a warm place and let rise,
  undisturbed, for 1 hour.
  
  The dough:
  
  Combine the sponge, salt, butter, cinnamon, 3 cups of the unbleached
  flour and the gluten flour.
  
  Using the flat paddle attachment of a heavy duty mixer, beat the
  dough for at least 4 minutes.
  
  Turn out dough onto a board and knead in the remaining 1/2 cup flour.
  (If you do not have a heavy duty mixer, knead the dough by hand for
  at least 10 minutes, incorporating the 1/2 cup flour.)
  
  The dough tends to be sticky, so have patience.  However, the finished
  dough should be on the softer-stickier side rather than being
  perfectly smooth.
  
  During the beating and kneading process, the dough should develop
  long, stretchy++strands a sign that the gluten has been well
  developed. This is necessary to finished rolls.
  
  Place the dough in a greased bowl, turn to coat with grease, then
  cover with plastic wrap, set in a warm place and let rise for 1 hour,
  or until doubled in bulk.
  
  To shape:
  
  Punch down the dough.and turn out onto a floured board.  Pinch off 12
  equal-size pieces of dough.
  
  With floured hands, roll each piece into an oblong, turning rough
  edges under with your fingers.
  
  To achieve the pointed tips, gently pull the ends of each oblong,
  giving a slight twist as you pull.  If the bolillos have sort of a
  rough surface, all the better.  They will look authentic.
  
  Place the bolillos on heavy baking sheets that have been greased or
  lined with parchment.  Make a each roll.
  
  Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for 30 minutes, or until
  almost doubled.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Pour the salted water into a spray bottle.
  
  Bake bolillos for 10 minutes, misting with the salt water at least 3
  or 4 times.  This will produce a crusty exterior.
  
  Reduce oven temperature to 375F and bake for 20 minutes longer, or
  until rolls are golden brown.
  
  Makes 12 bolillos.
  
  Note: Gluten flour may be found in natural food stores.

  Last weekend I finally managed to find good romertopf.  A big one++
  big enough for a small turkey!  And am I glad.  This is a neat way to
  cook. I fixed the following recipe and it came out great.  I fudged
  it a bit++added a couple of quartered taters, three cut up carrots
  and a couple of cut up celery stalks.  Everything came out cooked to
  perfection.
  
  After getting it, I went to the bookshelf and rummaged around for
  possible recipes and came across a book I'd forgotten I even had.
  These recipes are from it.  This recipe is the only one I've actually
  fixed, but if the rest are as good, I'll be impressed.  I had
  expected the chicken to have a soft, steamed skin, but the parts that
  were above the liquid were nicely browned.
  
  Here are some chicken ones, one for osso bucco and one for a New
  England boiled dinner that looks outrageous.
  
  In the book, Chalmers says that nearly any recipe can be adapted to
  the clay pot cookers by adding a hundred degrees to the listed
  temperature and adding half an hour to the cooking time.
  
  Soak the clay pot in cold water for 10 minutes.  Truss the chicken
  securely and sit it in the pot, breast side up.  Cut the bacon into
  small pieces and fry until crisp.  Drain the bacon and scatter it
  over the chicken breast. Add the onion, garlic, chicken broth, salt
  and pepper.
  
  Cover the pot and place it in a cold oven.  Adjust the heat to 450F
  and cook for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Drain the juices into a small saucepan.  Bring to boiling point and
  stir in the cornstarch dissolved in cold water.  Add the chives or
  parsley to the sauce and pour it over the chicken.  The chicken will
  be so utterly tender you will not have any difficulty carving it
  right out of the pot. Serve with rice or noodles and a tomato salad.
  
  Serves 4 and 2 children

      Title: Braised Duck with Orange-And-Lime Sauce (Zanzibar)
 Categories: African, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      5 lb To 5 1/2 pound duck
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      2 c  Chicken stock, fresh or
           -canned
     12    Whole cloves
      1    Fresh hot chili *
    1/2 c  Strained fresh orange juice
      2 tb Strained fresh lime juice
    1/2 c  Finely chopped sweet bell
           -pepper, preferably red
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Orange wedges or slices studded with whole cloves for garnish
  
  * about 1 1/2 to 2inches long, stemmed and seeded [The typical
  cautions about being careful with the things.  S.C.]
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Pat the duck completely dry inside and out
  with paper towels, and remove the large chunks of fat from the
  cavity. Cut off the loose neck skin and truss the bird securely, then
  prick the surface around the thighs, the back and the lower part of
  the breast with a skewer or the point of a sharp knife.
  
  In a heavy 5- to 6-quart casserole, heat the oil over moderate heat
  until a light haze forms above it.  Add the duck and, turning it
  frequently with a slotted spoon or tongs, cook for about 15 minutes,
  or until it browns richly on all sides.  Transfer the duck to a plate
  and discard the fat remaining in the casserole.  Pour in 1 cup of the
  chicken stock and bring to a boil over high heat, meanwhile scraping
  in any brown particles that cling to the bottom and sides of the pan.
  Stir in the cloves and chill, then return the duck and the liquids
  that have accumulated around it to the casserole.
  
  Cover tightly and braise in the middle of the oven for 1 hour. Remove
  the duck to a plate, and with a large spoon skim as much fat as
  possible from the surface of the cooking liquid.  Discard the cloves
  and chili.
  
  Add the remaining cup of stock to the casserole and, stirring and
  scraping in the brown bits that cling to the pan, bring to a boil
  over high heat. Mix in the orange juice, lime juice, sweet bell
  pepper and salt. Return the duck to the casserole and baste it with
  the simmering sauce. Cover tightly and return the duck to the oven
  for about 15 minutes. To test for doneness, pierce the thigh of the
  bird with the point of a small, sharp knife. The juice should trickle
  out a clear yellow; if it is slightly pink, cook the bird for another
  5 to 10 minutes.
  
  Place the duck on a heated platter and pour the sauce over it.
  Garnish the platter with the orange wedges or slices and serve at
  once.

      Title: Braised Lamb with Fruits and Nuts
 Categories: Indian, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This Indian dish is anything but understated.  It piles flavour upon
  flavour to stunning effect and would overwhelm milk-fed lamb.
  Amazingly, for something so sumptuous, it is comparatively
  nutritionally sound, as it has been modified to eliminate most
  saturated fat.  However it is not for the meal-in-a-moment cook.
  
  Cover 45 g of raisins and 30 g sultanas in boiling water.  Leave to
  soak. Trim an 800 g boneless piece of young lamb (leg or shoulder) of
  all visible fat.  Put the piece in a large saucepan and add 3 cups of
  water, a tablespoon of lemon juice and 2 bay leaves.  Cover, bring to
  the boil, skim, and simmer very gently for about one hour or until a
  skewer glides into the meat with ease.  Remove the meat, setting it
  aside, and reduce the stock over high heat to about 1/4 of a cup.
  Reserve the stock and wash the saucepan.
  
  Into a processor bowl put 2 large onions quartered, 6 cloves of
  garlic, 5 cm ginger roughly chopped, 1/2 tablespoon ground cardamom,
  2 tablespoons ground coriander, 1 teaspoon ground cloves, 1
  tablespoon white poppy seeds, 45 g ground almonds and 1 teaspoon
  black pepper. Process to a paste. Chop finely a generous handful of
  fresh mint and have ready 200 g plain yoghurt (low fat yoghurt can be
  used).
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons mono- or polyun- saturated oil in the saucepan, add
  onion and spice paste and fry, stirring, for about 3 minutes or until
  it is fragrant.  Add the mint and yoghurt and simmer gently till the
  sauce is thick and creamy.  Return the meat to the saucepan, spooning
  the sauce over it, cover and braise gently until the meat is heated
  through. Add the reserved stock to the saucepan and stir through.
  Continue to simmer uncovered until the stock is completely reduced.
  Sprinkle over the meat and sauce 2 teaspoons garam masala, 1 teaspoon
  chilli powder and salt to taste if you regard it as necessary.
  
  In a frying pan, heat a little oil and gently fry the drained
  sultanas and raisins, together with 45 g blanched slivered almonds,
  for about 5 minutes. Add them to the saucepan and stir.  Infuse a few
  strands of saffron in a tablespoon of boiling water and add 1 1/2
  teaspoons of rosewater. Stir this mixture into the saucepan and heat
  for a minute or so more.
  
  Slice the meat, which by now should be meltingly tender, and arrange
  on a serving dish.  Spoon the sauce over the meat.  Serve with rice.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

      Title: Braised Whole Fillet of Salmon (Julia Child)
 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Large carrot and onion cut
           -into neat 1/4-inch dice
      2    Or 3 tender celery stalks,
           -neatly diced
      2 tb Unsalted butter

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONINGS------------------------------
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
           And dried tarragon
      2 lb Skinless fillet of salmon
           -about 1/2 inch thick
  1 1/2 c  Dry white French vermouth
 
  MASTER RECIPE Braised Whole Fillet of Salmon in Wine and Aromatic
  Vegetables
  
  For 6 to 8 servings:
  
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:
  
  A no-stick frying pan for the diced vegetables; tweezers or pliers to
  remove bones; a lightly buttered baking dish that will just hold the
  fish comfortably (or an ovenproof baking and serving platter, or,
  lacking either, cut the fish in half crosswise, and reassemble it
  after cooking- the vegetables will mask the surgery); buttered wax
  paper to cover fish.
  
  THE AROMATIC VEGETABLES:
  
  Cook the diced vegetables slowly in the butter until quite tender but
  not browned- about 10 minutes.  Season lightly with salt, pepper, and
  a big pinch of dried tarragon.
  
  PREPARING THE FISH:
  
  Go over the salmon carefully with your fingers to detect any little
  bones; pull them out with tweezers or pliers.  Score the skin side of
  the fish. Dust with salt and pepper, and place best side up in the
  baking dish.
  
  ASSEMBLING:
  
  Spread the cooked diced vegetables over the fish, and pour 1/2 inch of
  vermouth around it.  Cover the fish with the wax paper, buttered side
  down.
  
  *Ahead-of-time note:
  
  May be assembled an hour or more ahead to this point; cover and
  refrigerate.
  
  BAKING:  12 to 15 minutes at 350F:
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Set the fish in the lower middle level,
  and, when beginning to bubble lightly, baste the surface with the
  liquid in the dish, basting several times again until the flesh feels
  lightly springy to the touch.
  
  Remove from the oven, and, holding the fish in place with a pot cover,
  drain the cooking juices into a saucepan.  Slide the fish onto a hot
  platter; cover and keep warm while making the sauce.
  
  VARIATIONS:
  
  AU NATURAL:  Braised Salmon Served in Its Own Juices:
  
  Rapidly boil down the cooking juices in the saucepan until almost
  syrupy. Pour them over the fish and vegetables, and serve.
  
  AROMATIC WHITE BUTTER SAUCE:
  
  The usual and lovely butter sauce of modern cookery can be as rich and
  buttery as you wish-from 3 or 4 tablespoons to half a pound.  Using
  the preceding boiled-down juices as a base, proceed to beat in the
  butter as in the lemon-butter sauce for the broiled fish on page 83.
  
  WINEY CREAM SAUCE:
  
  A reasonable and equally delectable compromise is a light veloute
  sauce made with the cooking juices, then boiled down with cream, as
  follows. Cook together 2 1/2 Tbs butter and 3 Tbs flour 2 minutes
  without coloring; off heat whisk in the hot braising juices and 1 cup
  heavy cream. Boil slowly until reduced to 1 1/2 cups; season
  carefully.
  
  (Full details for veloute sauce are on page 272.) Either serve the
  fish cloaked in its vegetables and accompany with the sauce, or fold
  the vegetables into the sauce and spoon over the fish.

  Crisp fried chicken is one of the things that I always find
  contradictory instructions for.  "ALWAYS cover the frying chicken."
  "NEVER cover the frying chicken." This is from "The Chef's Secret
  Cook Book" and directly addresses the question.  It works too.  I
  tried this out last night (used a bunch of chicken wings rather than
  whole cut up chickens) and came up with a crispy, nice batch of fried
  chicken.  The trick is explained in the "Chef's Secret" section
  below.  BTW, I used plain ol' commercial seasoned salt instead of the
  "Chef's Salt" called for and it turned out just fine.
  
  1.  When cutting the chicken into serving pieces, separate the thighs
  from the drumsticks, cut each breast in half, leaving a part of the
  breast meat on each wing, and, if you wish, cut two separate back
  pieces.
  
  2.  Take out all the small bones like the rib cage, backbone,
  collarbone, etc.,leaving only the main bones in the pieces.
  
  3.  Mix the flour with the Chef's Salt.  Beat the eggs with the 1/2
  cup milk and the water, then strain through a sieve.
  
  4.  Dip each chicken piece in the 2 cups milk, let the milk drip off,
  then dip it in the flour-spice mixture.  Be sure to completely cover
  with the flour mixture.  Shake off excess flour and then dip in the
  egg wash. Turn the piece to be sure no dry spots remain, then place
  the piece on the top of the piled up bread crumbs, Sprinkle more
  bread crumbs over the chicken until completely covered, then gently
  but firmly press down so that the crumbs really adhere to the
  chicken.  Shake off excess crumbs and lay the chicken parts on a
  paper covered tray, skin side up. Continue until all chicken is
  breaded.
  
  5.  In a large frying pan which has a lid, beat half of the
  shortening to approximately 360F and carefully, one by one, put in
  the chicken pieces, skin side up.  Add the chicken slowly so that the
  fat remains hot. Cover the pan, adjust the beat to medium, and cook
  for about 10 to 12 minutes.
  
  6.  Remove cover, turn pieces, and fry, uncovered, for another 10
  minutes or so.  Remove the pieces to a warm place on absorbent paper
  and keep warm until served.
  
  CHEF'S SECRET:  By straining the egg-milk-water mixture, called egg
  wash, you avoid having big parts of the egg white adhere to some
  pieces so that there is not enough of the egg wash for other pieces.
  Also, the straining makes the coating even.
  
  If you want to avoid lumps of flour and bread crumbs on your fingers,
  designate one hand as "wet" and the other as "dry." With the wet hand,
  handle the uncoated chicken, dip it into and remove it from the,
  milk, and place it on the flour.  Sprinkle flour over it with the dry
  hand, and coat it and lift it out with the dry hand.  Place it in the
  egg wash with the dry hand, lift it out with the wet hand, and then
  finish with the, dry hand.  It sounds complicated, but if you learn
  the trick you can prepare large amounts of chicken without ever
  getting lumps on your fin fingers.
  
  It is important to cover the pan while the bottom of the chicken is
  frying as this keeps it tender.  Frying the pieces without a cover
  after turning makes the skin crisp.
  
  CHEF'S SALT:
  
  Mix well and use instead of salt:
  
  Be careful to use garlic salt, not garlic powder, If you use garlic
  powder a small pinch is enough.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: Brenda's Black Bean Soup
 Categories: Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 c  Dried black beans
      2    Ham hocks
      1    Bell pepper (chopped)
      1 sm Onion (chopped)
      1    Whole sour orange or
           -tangerine
      1 tb Vinegar (if you used a
           -sweet orange or tangerine)
      1    Stick oleo
      2 tb Of flour
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Tried out the "White Trash Cookbook" last night and whipped up this
  black bean soup.  In spite of the fact that I forgot to finish it
  with the browned flour and butter, it turned out pretty darn good, if
  a tad bland. (I did cheat and use real butter instead of oleo.)
  Here's the recipe. Never having had black bean soup before, let alone
  making it, I'm not sure what would be kosher to liven it up a bit.
  Anyone have any tips? I served it with cornbread and a plate of
  sliced homegrown tomatoes. BTW, the recipe is transcribed exactly as
  it appears in the book to give a taste of Mickler's writing style.
  Pretty neat stuff, though I'm not sure if I'm ready for the cold
  collard sandwich yet...
  
  Put your beans in a soup pot and cover with water.  Boil, take off
  the fire and let sit til cool.  Cook onions and bell peppers in 1/2
  the oleo until limp.  Add them and the ham hocks and orange to the
  cooled beans; cover charitably with water.  Simmer until beans is
  soft (1 to 2 hours). Fish out the orange right now, before it gets
  tore up.  With the rest of the oleo, brown the flour in a black
  frying pan, then stir it into the beans. Brenda says:  "Make sure you
  got a soup, now.  If you need to add some more water, do it."

 Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 lb Broiler-fryer chicken *
      2 tb Melted butter mixed with
      1 ts Olive oil or cooking oil.
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper.
      1 pn Of thyme, tarragon or mixed
           -herbs, optional.

MMMMM------------------OPTIONAL DEGLAZING SAUCE-----------------------
      1 tb Finely minced shallot or
           -scallion
    1/2 c  Chicken stock and/or dry
           -white wine or French
           -vermouth
      1    Tb to 2 tb butter for
           -enrichment, optional
           * butterflied as described
           -in the preceding paragraph.
 
  This is a basic recipe that can be dressed up any way you like. This
  is one of the "Master" recipes in the book.  She presents Master
  recipes for each category of food then offers variations on the
  themes.
  
  I really like this book because it offers solid basics and then gets
  whimsical.  It really lives up to its "The Way to Cook" title.
  
  Of course you can broil a half chicken or chicken in parts, but when
  you want a handsome presentation at the table, butterfly is the way
  to go.
  
  To butterfly a chicken.  First remove the backbone by cutting down
  close to it on each side with a heavy knife or sturdy shears.  Spread
  the chicken skin side up on your work surface and bang the breast
  with your fist to break the collarbones and some of the ribs; this
  flattens the chicken. Cut off the little nubbins at the wing elbows,
  and fold the wings akimbo by tucking the wing ends behind the
  shoulders.  Then make a slit in the skin at either side of the breast
  tip.  Push the knee of the drumstick firmly up under the armpit to
  loosen the join; then pull it down and insert the tip of the
  drumstick through the skin slit.  The leg will be held in place.
  
  For 4 servings:
  
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:
  
  A stout knife and/or shears for preparing the chicken; a basting
  brush; a baking dish about 1 inch deep (without rack) that will just
  hold the butterflied chicken easily.
  
  Broiling - 25 to 30 minutes.  Preheat the broiler.  Brush the chicken
  all over with some of the butter and oil.  Arrange it skin side down
  in the baking dish, and set it so the surface of the flesh is about 5
  inches from the hot broiler element.  After 5 minutes, brush the
  flesh, which should just be starting to brown, with the butter and
  oil.  Baste again in 5 minutes ++ use the juices in the pan when the
  butter mixture is gone. Broil for another 5 minutes, then sprinkle
  lightly with salt, pepper, and optional herbs.  Turn the chicken skin
  side up.  Broil and baste 15 minutes or so more.
  
  When is it done?  The chicken is nearly done when brown juices begin
  to appear in the pan.  It is definitely done when the drumsticks feel
  tender, and, when the thickest part is pricked with the sharp tines
  of a kitchen fork, the juices run clear yellow.  Do not overcook.
  
  SAUCE:  Remove the chicken to a hot platter; cover to keep warm the
  few minutes required for the optional sauce.  Skim fat off the
  cooking juices, stir in the chopped shallot or scallion, and saute a
  moment on top of the stove.  Add the liquid and boil rapidly,
  scraping into it any coagulated cooking juices.  When reduced almost
  to a syrup, swirl in the butter. Pour the sauce over the chicken.
  
  SERVING:  To carve, cut straight down one side of the breastbone to
  separate the chicken in two lengthwise.  Grab under one of the knees
  with your fork to lift it up, slit the skin front and back, and bend
  the knee back at right angles to break open the joint at the small of
  the back. Then cut through the ball joint to separate the thigh from
  the carcass. Separate drumsticks from thighs at the knee joints.
  Remove the wings along with a lengthwise strip of meat from the lower
  third of the breast, to make meaningful servings.  You now have 2
  drumsticks, 2 things, 2 wings with a breast strip, and 2 breast
  sections ++ everyone has a little selection of both dark and light.
  
  Suggested accompaniment to broiled chicken.  You could serve broiled
  tomatoes, sauteed potatoes, and a green vegetable, or be more
  elaborate with an eggplant dish such as a souffle, or a ratatouille.
  Another idea is a hot corn salad.  For wine, either a sturdy white
  wine like a chardonnay or sauvignon, or a light red such as a pinot
  noir or Beaujolais.

    1/2 lb Peeled, deveined raw shrimp
 
  I seem to remember you being involved in a conversation about brown
  rice a few months back...  Here's something that you might find
  interesting.
  
  Put ham or bacon in a 4-quart soup kettle and cook over low heat
  until fat is rendered.  Increase heat to medium and stir until
  cooked, about 5 minutes.
  
  Remove chicken skin, cut meat off the bones and then cut boneless
  chicken into bite-size pieces.  Add to kettle or skillet with bacon
  or ham and toss until color turns pale, about 4 minutes.  Remove
  bacon or ham and chicken with a slotted spoon and put on paper
  toweling; set aside. Add sausage to kettle and brown all over, about

 Categories: Desserts, Ice cream, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    2/3 c  Sugar
      1 c  Heavy cream
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      4    Egg yolks
        pn Salt
      2 ts Brandy
    1/4 ts Vanilla
 
  Melt the sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring
  constantly, until it turns dark brown.  Meanwhile, combine the cream
  and milk in a saucepan and heat until mixture bubbles around the
  edge.  When sugar has caramelized, remove from heat and slowly begin
  stirring in the hot milk mixture.  Be careful; the mixture will
  bubble violently at first. Just stop pouring and stir until the
  bubbling subsides, then continue pouring until all of the milk has
  been incorporated an the caramel has completely dissolved.
  
  Place egg yolks in a bowl, add salt and beat to combine.  Slowly stir
  in half of the hot milk mixture.  Pour back into the remaining hot
  milk and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the
  custard thickens lightly.  Remove,from heat and stir in brandy and
  vanilla.

  Books.  No date given.
  
  This is an interesting little book (booklet, really) that must have
  come out just after WW II.  It was written by a Japanese lady living
  in Hawaii and tends to emphasize how genteel and hospitable the
  Japanese culture is++probably a good idea considering the historical
  context of the book.
  
  The recipes are all pretty basic but look good and call for real
  Japanese ingredients that I'm sure were either scarce or unavailable
  on the Mainland at the time.  Shoyu is, of course, soy sauce.  I
  can't believe that "gourmet powder" could be anything but MSG.
  Though it doesn't call for "fiddleheads" by name, I can't imagine
  what else "fern shoots" could be.

 Categories: Chinese, Cookies, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Package won ton wrappers
      1 c  Powdered sugar
           Oil for deep frying
 
  Fixed these guys last night.  Good stuff!  Quite simple to do.  I also
  tried using granulated sugar and cinnamon as well as the powdered
  sugar. All were equally good.
  
  Yield: About 80
  
  PREPARATION: Cut each won ton wrapper into 2 rectangles. Lay one
  rectangle on top of the other to form a double thickness. Make three
  1/2-inch slits in the center, lengthwise.  To form a bow, pull one
  end through the middle slit.
  
  COOKING: Deep fry butterflies until golden, about 1 minute or less.
  Drain on paper towel. Sift powdered sugar over both sides. Cool.
  
  DO-AHEAD NOTES: These keep several weeks in air-tight containers. [Fat
  chance! They didn't even make it through the next day! S.C.]
  
  COMMENTS: These can also be made from egg roll wrappers but they're
  three times as large.  I prefer using won ton wrappers because I
  think their mini size makes them more attractive.

           -French or Italian bread,
           -with crust, diced
           For croutons
      2 md Heads romaine lettuce
 
  Zesty Tabasco and Worcestershire spice up this innovation from "City
  Cuisine" by Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken (William Morrow and
  Co., 1989).  The dressing contains lightly cooked egg, so if made
  ahead must be refrigerated.
  
  Combine anchovies, black pepper and olive oil in a blender.  Puree for
  about 5 minutes until very smooth.  Add grated Parmesan.  Measure and
  reserve 1/3 cup for use with croutons.
  
  Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil.  Place a refrigerated egg
  on slotted spoon and into boiling water.  Cook for 1 1/2 minutes;
  remove and reserve.
  
  Place vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, celery salt, Tabasco and
  Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl and whisk in anchovy mixture.
  Crack open egg and spoon (including parts the are uncooked) into
  mixture. Whisk until well combined.  Refrigerate dressing if not
  using right away. Combine reserved anchovy mixture with diced bread
  in a bowl; toss to coat. Heat a dry cast-iron skillet or non-stick
  pan over medium-high and cook croutons, stirring constantly, until
  golden and crisp.
  
  Wash and dry lettuce and break into bite-sized pieces.  Place in a
  salad bowl along with dressing and toss well.  Add toasted croutons,
  toss again and serve.
  
  Makes 6 servings.
  
  NOTES: To crack peppercorns, place whole peppercorns on a work
  counter. Place the bottom of a heavy skillet or saucepan on top and
  push down and away from you.
  
  To puree garlic, place peeled garlic cloves in a blender with a dash
  of olive oil; puree.  Make in quantity, if desired, and store in the
  refrigerator as long as two weeks.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3    To 3 1/2 pounds pork butt,
           -shoulder or tenderloin
      4 tb Soy sauce
      5 tb Sugar
      3 tb Honey
      2 tb Hoisin sauce
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry
           -sherry
  1 1/2 ts Salt
           Mustard Dip (recipe follows)
      3 tb Toasted sesame seeds
 
  Think of these sweet, glazed strips of roast pork as the ham of Asia.
  Both Chinese and Southeast Asian cooks serve cha siu as a main dish,
  or as a meat addition or a delicious garnish in many stir-fry
  mixtures, soups, noodle dishes and fried rice.  Most Chinese cooks
  purchase their cha siu already prepared at a roasting shop
  (delicatessen). However, it is very easy to make at home, and the
  results are not as garishly red as some commercial versions made with
  food coloring.
  
  Remove and discard the excess fat from the pork.  Cut pork lengthwise
  (with the grain) into 2-inch wide strips 5 to 6 inches long. Put into
  a large bowl.
  
  Combine soy sauces, sugar, honey, hoisin, ginger, wine and salt. Pour
  over meat and rub it in well.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator
  at least overnight or for up to 3 days, turning several times.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  Place the pork strips on a broiler pan lined with foil.  Roast for 30
  minutes, turning once halfway through.  Increase the heat to 425F and
  roast for 10 minutes longer.  Let cool before slicing.
  
  To serve, cut across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Serve with
  mustard and sesame seeds for dipping.
  
  MUSTARD DIP:
  
  Mix together 2 tablespoons Colman's mustard, 2 tablespoons water,
  pinch of salt, pinch of sugar and a few drops of oil.

      Title: Caramel Powder
 Categories: Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  For years one of my favorite things has been the sheets of "caramel"
  that resulted when I baked a ham and the glazing ran down onto the
  foil lined baking pan, then set up.  Never occurred to me to use it
  in a recipe, but it did to someone at Sunset Magazine.  The
  illustration in the magazine shows the flan garnished with crunched
  up chunks of the un powdered caramel.
  
  Line a 10- by 15-inch baking pan with a single sheet of foil, folding
  up at edges.
  
  Pour 2 cups sugar into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan, place
  over medium-high heat. Shake pan often until most of the sugar
  liquefies, about 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium; tilt pan to mix
  hot caramel with sugar until all is melted and the color is deep
  amber, 3 to 5 ea minutes.
  
  Immediately pour hot caramel into foil-lined pan.  Using hot pads to
  protect hands (mixture is very hot), tilt pan to spread caramel in
  thin layer. Set aside until hard and completely cool, about 30
  minutes.
  
  When cool, lift foil from pan; peel foil from caramel.  Break caramel
  into chunks.  To make powder, whirl chunks in a blender or food
  processor fitted with metal blade (container must be completely dry).
  If you use a blender, you may need to make powder in several batches.
  Use, or store airtight at room temperature for up to 1 month.
  
  Makes about 1 3/4 cups.

      Title: Caramel Sauce
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
      4    Shallots, thinly sliced
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  Thought your reference to cooking sugar syrup to "caramelize" it was
  interesting.  It reminded me of a sauce that's used in Vietnamese
  cuisine. It's used in a variety of recipes and turns out to be the
  "secret" ingredient that gives barbecued Vietnamese stuff that unique
  taste when used as a marinade for strips of beef, chicken or pork.  I
  use it in Satay recipes.  The result is a subtle, delicious taste.
  It also gives a nice glazed finish to stuff.  Its use shouldn't be
  limited to Asian cuisine. In fact, I suspect that this is originally
  a French influence...
  
  "...the only rule to remember is to turn off the smoke alarm and open
  all the windows, as the sauce will smoke heavily, with a pungent
  smell." [I didn't find this to be much of a problem.  S.C..] Cook the
  sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low heat, swirling the pan
  constantly, until brown. It will smoke slightly.  Immediately remove
  the pan from the heat and stir the fish sauce into the caramel, being
  careful to guard against splattering (the mixture will bubble
  vigorously).
  
  Return the mixture to low heat and gently boil, swirling the pan
  occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 3
  minutes. Add the shallots and ground pepper to taste; stir to
  combine. Use in recipes where required.  [Or, as I noted, as a
  marinade for BBQ stuff. S.C..]
  
  NOTE:  Cool this sauce thoroughly before using.  If cold food is
  added to a caramel sauce that is hot, the sugar will harden instantly
  and you'll end up with a dish full of candy chips.
  
  Yield: 1/3 cup.

      Title: Caramelized Onion Confit
 Categories: Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      6 tb Olive oil
      5 tb Butter
     15    Onions (about 5 pounds),
           -peeled, thinly sliced
      4    Bay leaves
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  White wine
 
  When thin slices of onions are cooked very slowly in butter and olive
  oil they reduce to a dark, thick consistency much like a marmalade.
  
  Combine the olive oil and butter in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan
  over medium heat.  When the butter foams, add half of the sliced
  onions and 2 of the bay leaves.  Sprinkle with half of the sugar and
  half of the salt.
  
  Add remaining onions, bay leaves, sugar and salt.  Cover, reduce heat
  to low, and cook for 20 minutes.
  
  Uncover, stir, and increase heat to medium.  Cook for 15 minutes,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  Increase heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, until the onions
  are a deep golden brown, about 10 minutes.
  
  Add the wine and stir, scraping bottom of pan to dislodge any browned
  bits. Cook for 4 or 5 minutes longer.  Serve hot or at room
  temperature.
  
  Delicious with roast meats or poultry, as well with leftover turkey

           Text Only
 
  This is an absolutely no-fuss way to prepare artichokes, yet produces
  a delicious result.  The original Italian recipe on which this is
  based uses three times the amount of oil specified below, but the
  lower-fat version works fine.
  
  Have ready a basin of acidulated water.  Take 4 large artichokes or 8
  small ones and prepare them as described above, cutting them into
  quarters and dropping them into the basin as they are done. Pack the
  artichoke quarters in a single layer into a open pan.  Pour over them
  enough boiling water to barely cover the artichokes, add 2
  tablespoons of olive oil and some roughly crushed peppercorns.  Boil
  hard until the water has evaporated, then add the juice of a lemon
  and stir.
  
  Put the artichokes into a serving dish and scatter with chopped
  parsley. They can be served hot or cold.

 Categories: Greek, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Rich and flavourful but very simple to prepare, stuffed artichokes
  make a good dinner party starter.  They can be prepared well in
  advance and put into the oven at the last minute.
  
  Prepare 8 small artichokes as described above, cutting off at least a
  third of their tops.  Don't bother to remove the choke at this stage.
  Drop into boiling salted water and boil for I 0 minutes.  Drain
  upside down in a colander.  When cool enough to handle, remove the
  coarser outside leaves and the central leaves and the choke, to make
  cups.
  
  Mix together 100 g of finely chopped ham, 100 g chopped cooked
  chicken, 2 tablespoons of cream (or use evaporated skim milk),
  chopped parsley, salt, pepper and a pinch of nutmeg.  Stuff the
  artichoke cups with this mixture.
  
  Put the cups into an oiled baking dish, sprinkle with grated Parmesan
  cheese and bake in an oven preheated to 220C for about 15 minutes.
  Serve.

 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings

           -lettuce leaves
           Twelve 8-inch round dried
           -rice papers

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
      4    Garlic cloves
      2    Fresh Serrano chiles
      2 tb Sugar
      6 tb Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc
           -man)
      4 tb Fresh lime juice
      6    To 8 tablespoons water
 
  The Vietnamese use a small indoor earthen stove fueled with coal set
  on the table to simmer, boil and barbecue.  I have broiled this dish
  in an oven, with excellent results.  Sugar cane makes this recipe
  visually exciting and exotic.  Its sweetness subtly melts into the
  shrimp paste. Sugar cane comes fresh and canned in better Asian
  markets; the former is scarce and very expensive.  Check with the
  grocery clerk to make certain that you are buying the 6- to 7-inch
  long stalks, not the cubes.  The recipe serves well as a buffet
  appetizer or as a first course for a dinner party.
  
  Shell and devein the shrimp.  Toss with salt; let sit for 10 minutes.
  Rinse with cold water; drain thoroughly.  Blot dry. In a food
  processor, finely mince the garlic and shallots.  Add sugar, pepper,
  toasted rice powder, fish sauce, and shrimp; process into a smooth
  paste.
  
  With the machine running, pour the ice water through the feed tube;
  process until the shrimp is light and fluffy.  Cover and refrigerate.
  Pour vegetable oil into a small bowl.  Place a wire cooling rack on a
  baking sheet; brush with oil.
  
  Cut the sugar cane lengthwise into quarters to make 12 long strips.
  Dip your fingers into the oil, then take about 2 tablespoons shrimp
  paste and evenly mold a 1-inch cylinder around a sugar cane strip,
  leaving 1 inch free at both ends.
  
  Arrange the rolls on the rack diagonally, and keep them from touching
  each other.
  
  Arrange the cucumber, mint and coriander leaves, and lettuce on a
  platter; set aside.
  
  Broil the shrimp rolls about 6 inches from the heat, turning once,
  until the edges are bright orange and the filling feels firm to the
  touch, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
  
  To serve, take a rice paper sheet and set it on a plate.  Dip a pastry
  brush into a bowl of water.  Brush the entire rice paper generously
  with water.
  
  Let it sit until the paper is pliable and somewhat flimsy.  Put a
  lettuce leaf on one end of the paper.
  
  Place a cucumber sliver, mint and coriander leaves on top of the
  lettuce.
  
  Take a hot stick of sugar cane, break off the shrimp and place it on
  top of the vegetables.  Begin rolling up the paper to enclose the
  filling; form it into the shape of a cylinder.  Drip into the nuoc
  Cham Dipping Sauce,. and take a bite, then chew on the sugar cane for
  the sweetness (do not swallow the sugar cane).
  
  NUOC CHAM DIPPING SAUCE: Grind the garlic, chiles and sugar into a
  paste in a mortar, blender or mini-food processor. Stir in fish
  sauce, lime and water.  Strain into a dipping bowl.
  
  NOTE:  If sugar cane is not available, use a skewer or inexpensive
  bamboo chopsticks.  Soak them in water overnight before wrapping with
  shrimp paste.
  
  Makes 12 rolls or serves 6.

           -Note)
    1/4 lb Chinese barbecued pork
    1/4 ts White pepper
  1 1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      2 lb Fresh rice noodles, in
           -5/8-inch-wide strips
      4 tb Peanut oil
      4    Cloves garlic, chopped
      4    Shallots, sliced (1/2 cup
           -sliced)
      6    Fresh red chiles, seeded
           -and chopped
      1 c  Bean sprouts, tails removed
      1 c  Shredded Chinese cabbage
      2 lg Eggs
      4    Green onions, chopped
           Fresh coriander sprigs, for
           -garnish
 
   Nothing is more fascinating and delicious than eating at the open-
  air street hawker centers in Asia, particularly in Singapore.  Each
  stall serves a specialty, typically an honest, unpretentious,
  home-style dish for $1 to $3 a plate.
   This rice noodle dish is hawker food at its best.  If done right, its
  fragrance will tell you how good it's going to be as soon as it
  arrives at your table.  Singapore hawkers will use whatever seafoods
  are available, including cockles and sliced fish cakes in addition to
  those suggested in this recipe.  Feel free to experiment.
   1.  Steam the sausages for 10 minutes.  Cut them in thin diagonal
  slices. Toss the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  Let them
  stand for 10 minutes, rinse well with cold water, drain, and pat dry.
  Cut the squid into 1/4 inch rings and tentacles.  Cut the barbecued
  pork into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Combine the white pepper, soy
  sauces, and oyster sauce in a bowl; set aside.
   2.  Just before cooking, put the noodles in a large bowl and pour
  boiling water over them.  Stir gently with chopsticks to separate the
  strands, drain, and shake off the excess water.
   3.  Preheat a wok; when hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Add the
  remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the garlic, shallots, and chiles and
  cook over medium-high heat until the garlic is golden brown.
  Increase the heat to high and toss in the shrimp and squid; stirfry
  until the shrimp turn bright orange and the squid looks opaque white,
  about 2 minutes. Add the sausage slices, barbecued pork, bean
  sprouts, and cabbage; toss and stir until the vegetables begin to
  wilt.  Remove everything in the wok to a platter and set aside.
   4.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the wok; when hot,
  toss in the well-drained noodles.  Gently toss and flip the noodles
  to heat them through.  Be careful not to break them; it is okay if
  they brown slightly. Push the noodles up the sides of the wok to make
  a well in the middle; pour in the soy sauce mixture, then toss the
  noodles gently to sauce them evenly.  Make a well again and break the
  eggs into the middle. Without mixing them with the noodles, scramble
  the eggs lightly. When the eggs begin to set, add the green onions
  and return the seafood mixture. Gently toss together to reheat and
  mix.  Serve hot, with a hot chill sauce for seasoning to taste.
  Garnish with coriander sprigs.
   NOTE:  Both here and in Asia, fresh rice noodles are usually
  purchased rather than made at home.  Look for them in Asian markets
  or Chinese take-out dim sum shops.  This dish can be prepared with
  dried rice noodles; however, it is worth taking the time to seek out
  the fresh variety.
   Make certain that your wok is well seasoned or the fragile rice
  noodles will break apart and stick to the pan.  Although I hesitate
  recommending that you cook with a non stick wok or skillet, they will
  work fine if you are more comfortable with them.
   TECHNIQUE NOTE; To clean squid, start by separating all the
  tentacles from the heads, cutting across as close as possible to the
  eyes.  Squeeze out and discard the hard, pea sized beak in the center
  of each cluster of tentacles.  Rinse the tentacles and drain them in
  a colander. Grasp the mantle (the saclike "body" of the squid) in one
  hand and the head in the other and pull apart; the entrails will pull
  out attached to the head. Pull the transparent quill out of each
  mantle.  Discard everything but the tentacles and mantles.  Running a
  little water into each mantle to open it up, reach in with a finger
  and pull out any entrails remaining inside. (Working over a second
  colander to catch all the debris will make cleanup easier.) You can
  remove the spotted outer skin or leave it on (I prefer to remove it).
  Transfer the cleaned mantles to a cutting board, slice them crosswise
  to the desired size,and add them to the tentacles in the colander.
  Give everything another rinse and drain thoroughly.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings

 Categories: Mexican, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 sm Chayotes (about 6 ounces
           -each)
    1/2 c  Almonds
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs
      1 tb Brandy
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Milk or cream
        pn Nutmeg
  1 1/2 c  Sponge cake or pound cake *
    1/2 c  Golden sultana or black
           -raisins
      3 tb Slivered almonds
      1 c  Softly whipped cream,
           -barely sweetened
 
  * crumbled into fine crumbs, plus 2 tablespoons for topping (see note)
  
  This is a use for chayote that I would never have thought of, but it
  sounds really good.
  
  I love to shock people with the unexpected, such as serving these
  stuffed chayote shells for dessert.  In this recipe, chayote's
  delicate texture and taste combine with almonds, sugar, brandy, eggs,
  cream, raisins and sponge cake to make an elegant pudding-like
  filling for the pale-green shells. They are absolutely delicious and
  something you might have been served in one of the fine old
  households of colonial Mexico.
  
  Cut the chayote in half lengthwise and steam for 35 minutes, or until
  just tender.  Do not overcook++you don't want the shells to collapse
  when you scoop them out.
  
  Meanwhile, combine the almonds and sugar in a food processor and grind
  until the almonds are fairly fine.
  
  Preheat oven to 375F.
  
  When the chayote is cooked and cool enough to handle, remove the
  seed, and scoop out the pulp, leaving a 1/2-inch-thick shell.  Set
  aside.
  
  Place the chayote pulp in the processor with the ground almonds; add
  eggs and process to a puree.  Add the brandy, vanilla and milk or
  cream. Blend. Pour mixture into a bowl and stir in nutmeg, cake
  crumbs and raisins.
  
  Spoon the pudding mixture into the chayote shells (you will have
  about 1 1/2 cups left over) and place them in a greased baking dish.
  
  Sprinkle slivered almonds and reserved cake crumbs over the tops.
  Bake stuffed shells for 30 minutes.  Pour remaining pudding mixture
  into a greased loaf pan and bake for 25 minutes.
  
  Serve warm, topped with whipped cream.
  
  Serves 6 lucky people. (The pudding loaf serves 4.)
  
  NOTE:  I cheat and buy a frozen pound cake to use for this recipe.

    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
    1/4 c  Grated sharp cheddar cheese
    1/2 ts Red chile powder, for
           -garnish
 
  This one is a bit more traditional and savory.  In this dish, each
  vegetable beautifully complements the other.
  
  Serve as a vegetarian entree or as an accompaniment to grilled meats.
  
  Saute the onion in olive oil in a 2-quart saucepan.
  
  Meanwhile, peel the chayotes (chayote has a very thin skin and is
  easy to peel with a swivel-blade peeler), then cut each in half,
  scoop out and discard the seed, and dice the flesh.  Add to the
  saucepan, along with the diced chiles, corn, salt, pepper and milk.
  Cover, and simmer gently for about 15 minutes, or until chayote is
  tender.  Stir in the Parmesan and cook a few seconds until the sauce
  thickens.
  
  Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with cheddar cheese and chile
  powder.

  Still got those chestnuts sitting around?  Here's what Ken Hom has to
  say about preparing fresh chestnuts or use in Chinese cooking, along
  with a recipe for a braised dish in which they can be used.  The
  recipe doesn't specify how many chestnuts to use so use your own
  discretion.
  
  "The Chinese use the same Western chestnut with its sweet flavor and
  soft, mealy texture in stir fried dishes and stews like Chinese Beef
  Stew and in stuffings.  Shop for large, dark brown chestnuts in the
  fall, when they are in season.  Dried chestnuts, once soaked, can be
  used like fresh chestnuts.
  
  1. Boil the chestnuts for 30 minutes, shells on.
  
  2. Peel the outer skin first.
  
  3.  Peel the inner skin, revealing the golden meat.  Chestnuts are
  usually used either whole or split in half.

           -(bone-in)
      3    Stalks lemon grass, bruised
           -and cut into 1" lengths
      2 ts Laos powder (Ka)
      3    Green onions, finely chopped
      2 tb Coriander leaves, chipped
      4    To 6 fresh Serrano
           -chillies, seeded and
           -chopped
           Juice of 2 limes
      3 tb Fish sauce (Nam Pla)
 
  Here's another classic "Tom Yam" type chicken soup.  The "Laos"
  powder is dried galangal, powdered.  Unlike ginger, dried galangal
  seems to retain most of it's character.  If you use canned coconut
  milk, the "Thin" milk is the more watery liquid in the can.  The
  thick condensed stuff is coconut "cream" (not to be confused with the
  syrupy sweet coconut cream used for Pina Coladas).  If you shake the
  can up and combine the two, you have thick coconut milk.
  
  A lovely lemony, creamy soup, Dom Yam Gai calls for chicken pieces cut
  through the bone with a heavy cleaver, Chinese style.  If you find
  gnawing on chicken pieces and delicately trying to remove the bone,
  vainly searching for a place to deposit it, inhibiting your dinner
  conversation, you may debone the bird and substitute chicken pieces.
  In either case, use both dark and light meats for color and nutrition.
  
  [Although if you're talking at the table, ya got no reason to be
  eating a dish this good!  S.C.  ;-} ]
  
  In a saucepan, bring the "Thin" coconut milk to a boil.  Add the
  chicken pieces, lemon grass and Laos powder.  Reduce heat and simmer
  until the chicken is tender, about 15 minutes.  Do not cover as this
  will tend to curdle coconut milk.  When the chicken is tender, add
  the green onions, coriander leaves and chillies.  Bring the heat up
  just below boiling. Remove the pan from heat, stir in lime juice,
  fish sauce and serve.
  
  NOTE:  Beef cut into thin strips or firm white fish pieces may be
  substituted for chicken.

      Title: Chicken and Linguica Gumbo
 Categories: Cajun, Gumbo, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Linguica sausage, cut in
           -1/4-inch-thick rounds
           Vegetable oil
      1    (2 1/2- to 3 1/2-pound)
           -chicken, cut in pieces
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper to taste
    1/2 c  Flour plus 6 tablespoons
           -flour
  1 1/2 c  (about 2 bunches) finely
           -chopped green onions,
           -green and
           White parts
      1 c  Finely chopped celery
    1/2 c  Finely chopped green pepper
    1/4 c  Finely chopped parsley
      3    Garlic cloves, minced
      9 c  Chicken stock
           Cayenne pepper and/or
           -Tabasco sauce to taste
      2    To 6 teaspoons file powder,
           -according to taste
      4 c  Hot, freshly cooked rice
           Finely chopped green onions
           -for garnish
 
  Cook the sausage in a large, heavy ungreased skillet over low heat,
  turning the slices frequently with a spatula until there is a film of
  fat over the bottom of the pan.
  
  Increase the heat to medium and, turning the slices occasionally,
  continue to fry the sausage until the slices are browned, about 6
  minutes. Remove the sausage to paper towels to drain.  Add vegetable
  oil to the fat in the skillet to a depth of 1/2 inch.
  
  Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper.  Place 1/2 cup of the
  flour on a plate.  Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour and shake
  of the excess.
  
  Heat the oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. fry the chicken
  pieces in the hot fat until they are golden brown on both sides and
  the eat is cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes per side.  Remove
  the chicken from the skillet and drain on paper towels.  Reserve 6
  tablespoons of fat from the skillet an discard the rest. Whisk the
  reserved 6 tablespoons fat with the remaining 6 tablespoons of flour
  in a large, heavy pot until smooth. Cook, stirring frequently, over
  medium heat until the fat-flour mixture (called a roux) is nut brown.
  This will take several minutes. Do not allow the roux to burn.
  
  Add the green onions, celery, green pepper, parsley and garlic to the
  roux. Cook the mixture, stirring over medium-low heat until the
  vegetables have softened.  Then, stirring constantly, slowly add the
  chicken stock. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat. Add
  the sausage to the gumbo. Season to taste with salt, pepper, cayenne
  and/or Tabasco sauce. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  While gumbo is simmering, bone the cooked chicken and, using your
  fingers, shred the meat into pieces.  Add to the gumbo and simmer for
  15 minutes longer, stirring occasionally.
  
  NOTE:  The gumbo tastes best if prepared a day or two in advance and
  refrigerated.  Let the gumbo cool completely at room temperature,
  uncovered, before refrigerating.  Reheat over medium-low heat,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  Just before serving, remove the gumbo from the heat.  Taste for
  seasoning++it should be spicy.  Stir in the file powder to taste.
  (Note: File powder turns stringy as it cooks, so it should not be
  added to the gumbo until the pot has been removed from the heat.)
  
  Transfer the gumbo to a heated tureen and serve it immediately,
  accompanied by a bowl of rice.  To serve, place about 1/2 cup rice to
  one side of a heated soup plate..  Ladle the gumbo around the rice
  and garnish each serving with a sprinkle of finely chopped green
  onions.
  
  Serves 8.

MMMMM--------------------COMBINE, MIXING WELL-------------------------
      1    Egg, slightly beaten
    1/2 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce

MMMMM------------------SET LIQUIDS ASIDE.  MIX-----------------------

MMMMM-----------------------NOW, YOU NEED----------------------------
      6    (4-oz.) cubed steaks
 
  It is a "minute" or "cube" steak (steaks bought in a store already
  "tenderized") or round steak pounded out thin, breaded and fried in
  hot oil so it develops a crust like typical fried chicken.  The steak
  should be around 1/4 inch thick.  It's served topped with a white
  cream (or milk) gravy.
  
  Dip steaks in buttermilk mixture, dredge in flour mixture.  Let stand
  for 10 minutes on paper towels.  Fry steaks in 1/4" vegetable oil in
  a heavy skillet at medium high heat (375F) until browned, adding oil
  as necessary. Remove steaks and drain on paper towels.
  
  Pour off pan drippings, reserving 3 Tb. drippings.  Add 1/4 cup of
  flour; stir over medium heat until bubbly.  Boil 1 minute, stirring
  constantly. Add 2 cups milk; cook until thickened, stirring
  constantly. Stir in 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper.  Add steaks to
  gravy.  Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.

      1    Whole chicken, about 3
           -pounds, cut Into serving
           -pieces
     11    Cloves garlic, crushed
      1 tb Coarse salt
      1 ts Freshly ground popper
      2 tb Corn or vegetable oil
     20 sm New potatoes, peeled
    3/4 c  Red wine vinegar
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      2 ts Salt
      6    Bay leaves
      2 tb Each dried thyme and
           -marjoram
      2    Chiles serranos (optional)
 
  Hey++just found this one in a Cookbook Digest.  It might work well in
  the Romertopf.  Or the Chinese sandy pots for that matter.
  
  The traditional way to prepare this chicken dish from Michoacan, is
  in a clay casserole dish covered with a sealing layer of ground corn
  or masa. Small bits of the corn mixture break off and add a
  thickening texture to the sauce.  This modern version is much simpler
  to prepare.
  
  Rub the chicken with the garlic, salt, and pepper and refrigerate for
  2 to 4 hours.
  
  In a large skillet, heat the corn oil, saute the chicken briefly and
  transfer to a cazuela or large pot.  In the same oil, lightly brown
  the potatoes, remove, and set aside.  Add the vinegar to the skillet
  and bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the
  skillet. Pour the vinegar through a strainer over the chicken.
  
  Add the olive oil, salt, bay leaves, thyme, and marjoram to the
  chicken cazuela.  Bring to a boil over high heat, cover, and lower
  the heat. Every 10 minutes, uncover and stir.  After 35 minutes,
  uncover, correct the seasonings, and add the chiles and potatoes.
  Cover and cook over low heat until the potatoes are tender, about 15
  minutes.

 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    Stalks lemon grass
      1 c  Water
      4 c  Coconut milk
      8    Chicken thighs or
  1 1/3 lb Chicken breast, diced
     10 sl Galangal
      2 tb Fish sauce
      3 sm Fresh chilies
      3    Bergamot leaves
      2 tb Lemon juice

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Spring onions, shredded
           Chilies, shredded
 
  This one's a bit more complex and gets into some exotic ingredients.
  All of them should be available from an Asian grocery.  If you have
  any questions about what the ingredients are or how to use them, just
  ask. The only thing that can not be substituted for is the fish
  sauce.  You could use ginger instead of galangal, but the soup would
  lack the perfumed, exotic aroma of the galangal that adds so much to
  the dish.
  
  Lime zest could be used for the bergamot leaves.
  
  Cut the lemon grass into 1-inch pieces.  Bring the water to the boil
  with half the coconut milk.  Then add the chicken, lemon grass,
  galangal and 1 tablespoon fish sauce.  Simmer for about 20 minutes or
  until the chicken is cooked.  Less cooking time will be required for
  diced chicken breast.
  
  Stir in the remaining coconut milk and turn up the heat.  As soon as
  it begins to boil, toss in the whole chilies and bergamot leaves.
  Stir, and remove from the heat.
  
  Serve in individual bowls.  Sprinkle each with lemon juice and fish
  sauce to taste and garnish with slivers of spring onions and chili.

  The following few posts are from "Mother Magyar", by Meryl Constance

  Adler, a Jewish lady who emigrated to Australia as a young woman
  shortly after WWII. Though she didn't know how to cook anything then,
  let alone Hungarian food, over the years she learned the art.  The
  following recipes comprise an Hungarian feast and observe Jewish
  dietary laws. They look quite good and are remarkably simple.  So
  good that I typed them in by hand... There was a crease across them
  that drove my scanner bonkers.
  
  Maybe Mark can help us out with terms like "Becel margarine" and "No.
  15 chicken"...
  
  Put the marrow bone, chicken carcasses and giblets in a large pot
  with 2 litres of water.  Bring to the boil, skim and reduce to a slow
  simmer. Meanwhile, chop vegetables.  After the soup has been
  simmering for half an hour, add the vegetables and parsley stems and
  continue cooking for about 2 hours.  Strain the broth, reserving the
  carrots and giblets. Add salt to taste.  Slice the carrots and
  giblets and return them to the soup.
  
  In a separate pot of boiling water, cook the noodles and then drain
  them. divide the noodles between 8 soup plates and ladle the soup
  over it. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.

      Title: Chile-Fried Squid (Sambal Cumi-Cumi)
 Categories: Indonesian, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Squid
    1/2 c  Diced onion
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      3    Or 4 semi-hot fresh red
           -chiles, minced, or 1
           -teaspoon sambal ulek
    1/2 ts Kosher salt
      2 tb Oil
      1 ts Paprika, if needed
      2 tb Tamarind Water or lemon
           -juice
 
  In its most authentic form, this sambal is bright red with chile and
  quite hot.  If you prefer it a little milder, use fresh chiles that
  are not too hot, such as the milder strain of jalapenos now on the
  market; otherwise, use less chile and make up the color difference
  with paprika.
  
  [Personally, I'd use crushed and soaked annatto seeds.  They add red
  color without the paprika taste.  S.C.]
  
  1.  Clean squid.  Remove purplish outer skin and cut sacs into rings.
  
  2.  To prepare in a mortar:  Pound onion, garlic, chiles, and salt
  together to a coarse paste.  To prepare in a blender or food
  processor: Grind together with oil.
  
  3.  In a wok or skillet, heat oil over low heat and add paste.  (If
  oil was used in grinding paste, add paste to dry pan.) Cook slowly
  until quite fragrant and oil is well stained with red.  Add paprika
  if necessary to enhance color.
  
  4.  Turn heat to medium-high, add squid and Tamarind Water, and cook
  just until squid is done (about 2 minutes).  Serve hot or at room
  temperature.
  
  Serves 4 to 6 with other dishes.

      Title: Chinese Beef Stew
 Categories: Chinese, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 lb Brisket of beef or stew beef
      4 tb Peanut oil

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 ml Fermented red bean cake *
      3 tb Hoisin sauce
      4 tb Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
      4 tb Thin soy sauce
      1 tb Minced garlic
      1    Whole star anise
      1 ts Roasted and crushed
           -Szechwan peppercorns
      1 ts Five spice powder
      2 ts Sugar
      6 c  Water
      1 lg (about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs)
           -Chinese (icicle) radish,
           -roll cut.
 
  Tough beef is most flavorful, but you must simmer it gently for
  several hours to soften the sinewy muscle.  Slow braising also
  encourages an exchange of flavors between the meat and the tangy
  sauce, enhancing both. Chinese radish adds just the right bite, much
  as turnips would in a Western stew.  In effect, this is Chinese beef
  stew.
  
  Game meats or goat meat may be substituted for the beef for a
  delicious and unusual variation.  Oxtails can also be braised in this
  manner, or even veal shanks.  Almost any cut of meat or organ that
  requires extensive cooking does well if braised.  The strong sauce
  keeps the meat flavorful throughout.
  
  Turnips or carrots may be substituted for the Chinese radish, and
  chestnuts have a strong, sweet taste that holds up well to braising.
  [Make a diagonal slice, roll daikon 1/4 turn and slice again.
  Continue rolling and cutting until done. S.C.]
  
  * [This is nice if you have some laying around, but don't worry if you
  don't.  The taste can be somewhat bizarre for a Westerner, but it
  won't overwhelm the dish S.C.]
  
  1.  The preferred cut is brisket of beef, a boneless piece of tough
  meat from the underside of the steer, because of its rich, gelatinous
  texture when cooked.  It is sold in Chinese meat markets as Chinese
  stew beef. Any tough beef cut can be used, such as boneless chuck and
  bottom round.
  
  2.  Trim away the outer layers of fat.
  
  3.  Cut the meat into 1 1/2 inch strips.
  
  4.  Cut the strips into cubes.
  
  5.  Brown the meat on all sides in a wok over a high flame in 3
  tablespoons of the oil.  Set it aside.
  
  6.  In the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil, over a high flame, break up
  the red bean curd with a spatula.
  
  7.  Add the remaining sauce ingredients.  Bring them to a boil.
  
  8.  Add the beef to the sauce, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the
  wok, and braise the beef for 2 hours.  After 1 1/2 hours, add the
  roll-cut radish.  Cook for 30 minutes more, until both the beef and
  radish are tender.
  
  9.  Serve the stew immediately.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: Chinese Chili with Peppers
 Categories: Chinese, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    3/4 lb Ground lamb
      1 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb Hoisin sauce
      1    Green bell pepper
      1    Red bell pepper
      1    Yellow bell pepper
      1 sm Yellow on1on
      2 tb Cornstarch
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
      4    Cloves garlic, finely minced

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 tb Dry sherry
      2 tb Hoisin sauce
      2 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Bean sauce
      1 tb Oriental sesame oil
      1 tb Distilled white vinegar
  1 1/2 ts Chinese chili sauce
 
  Stir-fried ground meat and diced vegetables in a spicy sauce produce
  an Oriental "chili" that can be mounded on steamed rice or buttered
  noodles to make a quick and satisfying dinner.
  
  ADVANCE PREPARATION:
  
  In a bowl, thoroughly combine lamb, soy sauce, sherry, and hoisin
  sauce. Set aside until ready to cook.
  
  Seed and stem peppers, then cut into 1/2 inch cubes.  Peel and
  coarsely chop onion.  Set peppers and onion aside.
  
  In a small bowl, combine sauce ingredients; set aside.
  
  LAST-MINUTE COOKING:
  
  Stir cornstarch with an equal amount of cold water, then set aside.
  Place wok over highest heat.  When wok becomes very hot, add 1
  tablespoon peanut oil to center, then roll oil around sides of wok.
  When oil just begins to smoke, add lamb and stir-fry, pressing meat
  against the sides of the wok, until it loses its raw color and
  separates into small pieces, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to a work
  platter.
  
  Immediately return wok to highest heat and add remaining tablespoon
  peanut oil to center.  Add ginger and garlic and saute for a few
  seconds. Add vegetables and stir-fry until peppers brighten and onion
  becomes transparent, about 2 minutes.
  
  Return lamb to wok and pour in sauce.  Bring sauce to a low boil,
  then stir in a little cornstarch mixture to lightly thicken.  Reduce
  heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes.  Turn out onto a heated platter
  or individual plates. Serve at once with steamed rice, noodles, or
  bread.
  
  Serves:  2 as an entree; 6 to 8 as part of an Oriental meal.
  
  MENU IDEAS:  Easy dinner for 4 - Chinese Chili with Peppers (double
  recipe); Onion Bread (double recipe; cook before guests arrive, and
  reheat in oven); Steamed Corn with Chinese Herb Sauce; ice cream and
  coffee.
  
  Notes:  This dish is excellent made with ground pork, beef, or lamb,
  but not with ground veal, chicken, or turkey.
  
  To simplify any stir-fry dish, substitute 3/4 pound ground meat (pork,
  beef, or lamb) for the cubed or sliced meat or seafood.  This
  shortens the preparation time but results in an equally good dish.

      2 ts Sesame oil to brush on top
           -of pizza
 
  This is from one of Martin Yan's books...  I haven't tried this, but
  it looks pretty tasty.  In general, I don't care for Yan's recipes,
  although I do get a kick out of his show.  I don't know what it is,
  but the few things I've made from this book just don't seem to quite
  make it.
  
  1.  To make crust:  Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water.  Let set
  for 10 minutes.  Stir in oil and salt; add flour gradually.  Knead
  dough for 10 to 15 minutes or until smooth and elastic.  Place in
  greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place free from drafts
  until double in bulk (1 1/2 to 2 hours).  Punch down dough and roll
  into thin crust.  Make 2 pizzas of 12" diameter, 1/4" thickness.
  Place crust on baking sheet.
  
  2.  Combine ingredients for sauce and set aside.
  
  3.Heat oil over high heat; put in garlic and ginger, stir for 5
  seconds. Add remaining ingredients, except hoisin sauce, catsup and
  sesame oil; reduce heat to medium-high.  Stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes.
  Add hoisin sauce and catsup and stir-fry for another minute.
  
  4.  Spread sauce on dough, then top with stir-fried vegetables and
  meat; brush sesame oil on top.
  
  5.  Bake pizza at 375F for 15 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve
  and enjoy.
  
  REMARKS: One cup of sausage is equal to 3 sausages. For a classier
  pizza, add 1/2 cup sliced prawns For added hotness, put 1/2 teaspoon
  hot chili oil into the sauce.

  a shallow saucer.  Top with the shredded ginger. Sprinkle sugar and
  salt evenly over the ginger.  Pour the vinegar over the ginger. Heat
  the oil until it's hot but not smoking, and pour it over the mixture.

      Title: Chow Mein (Two Sides Brown Noodles)
 Categories: Chinese, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
 
     10 sm Black dried mushrooms
    1/2 lb Fresh Chinese egg noodles
           -(regular mein)
           Sesame oil
    1/2 lb Sea scallops
           Cornstarch
    1/2 lb Flank steak
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
    1/2 c  Bamboo shoots, sliced
      1 lb Bok choy, cut in 1 1/2-inch
           -lengths
      2    Eggs
  2 1/4 c  Fresh chicken stock
      2 tb Light soy sauce
           Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
           Peanut oil
      1 tb Or more dry sherry or
           -Shaoxing rice wine
 
  Here's a recipe for Chow Mein which is a pretty classic application
  using pan fried noodles.
  
  Put the mushrooms in a small bowl and pour boiling water over them.
  Let soak for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, cook the noodles in a large quantity of boiling water for
  3 1/2 to 5 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold water, drain again, toss
  with a little sesame oil and set aside.
  
  Cut The scallops in half, toss with a little sesame oil and 1 1/2
  teaspoons of cornstarch; refrigerate.  Cut the flank steak as thinly
  as possible across the grain.  Toss with 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch,
  in a little sesame oil and the dark soy sauce; set aside.  When the
  mushrooms have soaked, squeeze them out over the soaking liquid, and
  reserve 1/4 cup of the liquid.  Cut off the mushroom stems and
  discard; cut the caps in two and set aside with the bamboo shoots and
  bok choy.
  
  Lightly beat the eggs with a few drops of sesame oil.  Heat a small
  frying pan and oil the bottom lightly.  Pour in enough of the beaten
  egg to cover the bottom, pouring any excess back into the uncooked
  eggs. Cook just until set and remove.  Repeat until all the egg is
  used up. Stack the egg crepes, roll them up and slice across the roll
  into shreds. Set aside.
  
  Mix the chicken stock with the light soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  and the sugar; set aside.  Heat this mixture in a small pot over low
  heat.
  
  Meanwhile, heat a wok over medium high heat until hot.  Add 1 cup
  peanut oil and heat until the oil is very hot.  Lower the noodles
  into the oil to form a nest and let them cook until brown on one
  side.  (This may take 8 minutes or so.) Turn the noodles over and
  brown on the other side. (This will be much faster.) Remove to a
  large serving platter and keep warm.
  
  Cook the scallops very briefly in the same oil, remove and drain in a
  colander.  Turn the heat off under the oil and add the beef.  Stir
  just until the meat slices are separated and start to change color.
  Remove to drain with the scallops.
  
  Pour off all the oil but 1/4 cup and heat.  Add the vegetables and
  stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the seasoned stock and bring to a
  boil. Mix the reserved mushroom soaking liquid with 2 tablespoons of
  cornstarch until dissolved and stir into the chicken stock sauce.
  Stir until it thickens and clears slightly.  Add the beef and
  scallops, then the wine and cook just until heated through.  Pour
  over the noodles and serve garnished with the egg shreds.

      Title: Cinnamon Pate (Cha Que)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 appetizer
 
      1 lb Boneless pork (weight after
           -trimming fat), preferable
           -fresh ham
      3 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      3 tb Water
    1/2 tb Potato starch or rice flour
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
        ds MSG (optional)
           Sprinkling of freshly
           -ground black pepper
      2 oz Pork fat
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  This recipe is very tasty with an interesting texture.  Unless you're
  a fan of hard work, use a food processor.  The pate was originally
  pounded to the proper consistency in a mortar and pestle...  It can
  be used all sorts of ways++made into balls for soup, sliced after
  cooking and added to lettuce or rice paper rolls, served with shrimp
  chips for munchies++whatever inspires you.  The cinnamon flavor is
  discernible but not overpowering. I've actually made this recipe and
  found it to be a keeper.
  
  Be sure pork is trimmed of all fat.  Slice the meat 1/4 inch thick,
  then cut into 1 inch squares.  Make a marinade by combining all the
  remaining ingredients, except for the pork fat and cinnamon, in a
  large bowl. Add the pork slices to the marinade and mix well with
  your hands, then cover the bowl with wrap or foil.  Refrigerate for 5
  hours, and after that period of time has elapsed, transfer the bowl
  to the freezer for 10 minutes.
  
  Remove the pork from the freezer, add the cinnamon, and reduce to a
  paste in a food processor only.
  
  Boil the pork fat for 10 minutes and dice into small pieces, the size
  of whole peppercorns.  Add the diced pork fat to the ground pork
  mixture.
  
  Coat an 8-inch-square baking pan with oil.  Put the meat paste into
  the pan and press down firmly with your hands, making sure the
  surface is smooth. The meat will come halfway up the side of the pan.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F and bake the pate for 40 minutes or until the
  surface looks brown.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.  Then
  slice and serve as an appetizer or with French bread for lunch or
  dinner, or use in any recipe where it is required.  It can be eaten
  hot or cold.
  
  This will keep fresh in the refrigerator for a week, or it can be
  stored for a longer period in the freezer.  To reheat, wrap in foil
  and place in a 300F oven for 15 minutes.

      Title: Clay Pots for Cooking
 Categories: Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  It's a great way to cook. I'd seen these Romertopfs at sales for
  years. One day, probably because picking were slim that particular
  day,
  
  I bought one++a nice big one that will hold a small turkey.  I had
  been missing out.  They aren't just fad items.  They produce
  excellent dishes. Meats cooked in 'em don't  dry out.
  
  HOW IT WORKS:
  
  Clay is a porous material.  When the pot is saturated with water and
  put into the oven, there is a slow evaporation of steam from within
  the pores of the clay itself.  During the cooking process, the food
  forms its own juices.  These juices cannot escape until the pot is
  completely dry.
  
  Fortunately, when the pot becomes dry, the food is cooked!
  
  Because wet clay does not become as hot as metal, it is necessary to
  cook at a higher temperature than is usual, (450F rather than the
  customary 350F).  However, in spite of this high temperature, the
  danger of burning is minimal and can only take place if the food is
  cooked for too long a period of time.
  
  As a general rule, if you add 100 degrees F. and 30 minutes to the
  cooking time of any recipe, it can be adapted for use in a clay pot.
  For instance, if you normally cook a 3 pound chicken at 350F for 1
  hour, you will need to cook it in a clay pot at 450F for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  The manufacturers of clay pots recommend that they always be placed
  in a cold oven.  However, in an emergency, I have occasionally put
  the pot into a pre-heated 350F oven and it did not crack nor did the
  food come to any harm.  It is also possible to reheat food in a clay
  pot.
  
  Soak the lid in cold water for 10 minutes, cover the pot and pop it
  back into a 350F oven for 30 minutes.
  
  CLEANING THE POT:
  
  As you discover the almost miraculous results of cooking in clay, you
  will be using your pot with greater and greater frequency and it will
  quickly lose its brand new appearance.  Though the pot goes through a
  short period of adolescence when it looks slightly mottled, it
  eventually acquires a character of its own and you begin to find
  yourself less concerned about the odd blemishes which refuse to budge
  in spite of the most desperate scrubbing.
  
  The pot is, in fact, very easy to clean because food will not stick
  to the surface (unless, of course, you burn it on).  Simply let the
  pot cool after it has been taken from the oven and soak it in warm
  water for a few minutes.  Sprinkle the pot with salt and scour it
  with a stiff brush. Rinse the pot and let it drain until it is dry.
  (As clay is porous, it is not wise to clean it with detergents or
  scouring powder.)
  
  I have heard it said that you need a separate clay pot for cooking
  fish, but I have not found this to be so, in fact I have been unable
  to detect any lingering flavors or odors even after it has been used
  for the spiciest of recipes.  However if you do feel any concern over
  the matter, you can soak the pot in hot water adding three
  tablespoons of baking soda to each quart of water.  This will clean
  it very thoroughly and even small black scorch dots can be coaxed
  from the clay with the minimum of effort.
  
  Store the pot as you would any other utensil.  It is considerably less
  fragile than it appears, and unless you drop it on the floor, it will
  survive many accidental knocks and bumps without complaint.  Do take
  the precaution of storing the lid alongside, rather than on top of
  the pot. This eliminates the risk of the development of mold inside
  the pot in case it was not completely dry.

      Title: Cleaning Fresh Crabs
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 info
 
      1    Information
 
  Here's what Ken Hom has to say about cleaning fresh crabs.  Just one
  point that he overlooks...  I can't bring myself to cook or dismember
  a live animal.  In another book it says that a crab can be killed
  instantly and painlessly by stabbing through the shell just behind
  the eyes.
  
  Cracking and Cleaning a Live Crab
  
  As soon as a crab (or any shellfish) is killed, it starts to lose
  flavor. To preserve the full freshness and taste, crab must be cut up
  just before cooking.  Once you eat crab prepared this way, you will
  never want to go back to precooked crab.  The texture and flavor are
  worlds apart. West Coast Dungeness crab, used here, is meatier and
  sweeter than the blue crabs caught in eastern waters.  Their
  structures are identical, however, so the technique is the same for
  both.  To keep from getting pinched, hold the crab from the back or
  wear thick gloves.  The cracked and cleaned crab pieces can be
  stir-fried or steamed.  If you can't imagine yourself cutting up a
  live crab, steam it for 5 minutes first then cut it up as described
  here.
  
  [The following steps are illustrated with photos in the book, but I
  think you'll be able to get the idea.  S.C.]
  
  1.  Always hold the crab at the back to avoid the large pincers.
  
  2.  Twist off the large pincers.  Then break off the rest of the
  smaller legs.  Scrub the shells clean under running water.
  
  3.  Pull the large top shell off the crab in one piece.  Set it aside.
  
  4.  Pull off the feathery lungs and rinse the crab's body clean under
  running water.
  
  5.  On the bottom of the crab, find the "tail", a piece of shell that
  is folded against the crab's bottom.  Pull this tail away from the
  body.
  
  6.  Removing the tail exposes the inside of the crab.  Rinse it out.
  
  7.  In the large shell, near the mouth, there is a small dark sac.
  Remove it with a spoon, being careful not to break it.  Don't remove
  the yellowish-brown "crab butter" from the shell, which has a rich
  flavor.
  
  8.  Cut the body in quarters.
  
  9.  Crack the claws by tapping them with a cleaver, or by placing a
  cleaver on top of the claw and hitting the back of the cleaver with
  the heel of the hand.  [Place the cleaver's flat side on top of the
  claw. S.C.]
  
  10.  Cut the tips off the legs.
  
  11.  Crack the legs one by one.  Turn each leg so that the edge is up,
  enabling you to tap the shell with the side of a cleaver just hard
  enough to crack the shell, but not so hard as to crush the fragile
  meat.

      Title: Coconut Chicken Soup
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 cn Coconut milk
      4 c  Chicken stock
      1 md Chicken
      1 c  Whipping cream
      4 sl Galangal
      1    Lime or lemon
        pn Of chili powder
           Salt
 
  A very simple one...
  
  Heat stock and add galangal, chili, whipping cream and coconut milk.
  Cut chicken up into bite size pieces.  As soon as the mixture begins
  to boil, add the chicken pieces and squeeze in the lemon or lime
  juice and salt to taste.  The trick is to add the chicken right when
  the mixture starts to boil.  Don't let the milk really boil.  Cook
  the chicken for a very short time, about half a minute.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  I must admit that when I typed this recipe, I missed the
  amount of coconut milk to use.  The one can is a guess++that's how
  much I would use, at least on the first try.

      Title: Coconut Custard
 Categories: Thai, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      5    Eggs
      1 c  Coconut cream
      1 c  Sugar
 
  I thought I detested coconut until I discovered coconut milk and
  cream and all the goodies made with it.  I still think the texture of
  the dried stuff we get in stores is pretty abominable but here's a
  couple of recipes that use coconut in it's liquid form.  You should
  be able to find canned coconut milk in a store near you.  If not, I
  wouldn't bother with these recipes. I do have instructions for making
  coconut milk and cream from both fresh nuts and the dried shreds, but
  it tends to be a bit of a hassle.
  
  Beat the eggs with the coconut cream and sugar until the mixture is
  frothy. [Coconut cream is the thick stuff off the top of a can of
  coconut milk++not the stuff used to make Pina Coladas.  It's thick
  and rich but not sweet. Don't shake the can before you open it.  Open
  it carefully and then spoon the thick cream off the top of the
  coconut milk. S.C.]
  
  Pour the liquid into small molds.  Place in a steamer over boiling
  water, cover and cook for about 20 minutes or until the mixture has
  set.

      Title: Coconut Flan with Caramel (Banh Dua Ca Ra Men)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 dessert
 
MMMMM--------------------------CARAMEL-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Hot water

MMMMM--------------------------CUSTARD-------------------------------
      1 c  Fresh or canned coconut milk
      1 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  This is the ultimate coconut dessert++an adaptation of the classic
  "Creme renversee", or "Flan au caramel".  The technique used is
  distinctly French but the flavors are all Vietnamese.
  
  This custard is at its best when prepared a day in advance and
  refrigerated so the flavors can mellow.  If you just can't wait, you
  might try the Vietnamese method of rapid cooling for dishes such as
  this: place a small scoop of shaved ice on top of each custard before
  serving!
  
  Preheat the oven to 325F.
  
  Make the caramel:  Cook the sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low
  heat, swirling the pan constantly, until brown.  Stir the hot water
  into the caramel, being careful to guard against splattering (the
  mixture will bubble vigorously).  Boil the mixture, swirling the pan
  occasionally, until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, about 2
  minutes.
  
  Pour the caramel syrup into a 1-quart souffle dish or five 4-ounce
  ramekins.  Tilt the molds to coat all of the surfaces with caramel.
  
  Make the custard:  Combine the coconut milk, milk and sugar in a
  medium saucepan over low heat.  Scald until the sugar dissolves
  completely. Remove from heat.
  
  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla.  Gradually whisk the hot
  coconut milk mixture into the eggs, blending thoroughly.
  
  Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a bowl.  Carefully pour
  into the caramel-lined souffle dish or ramekins.
  
  Line a large roasting pan with 2 layers of paper towels (see Note).
  Put the souffle dish in the roasting pan and add hot water to reach
  halfway up the side of the dish.  Bake in the center of the oven for
  50 minutes (30 minutes if using ramekins), or until a knife inserted
  in the center comes out clean.  Be careful not to let the water boil;
  do not disturb the custard while baking.  This is the only "secret"
  to producing a smooth and velvety custard.
  
  Remove the souffle dish immediately from the hot water.  Allow to
  cool in a cold-water bath.  Chill thoroughly.
  
  To serve, run a knife around the edge of the custard and turn out onto
  dessert plates.  Serve with shaved ice or whipped cream, if desired.
  
  Note:  The paper towels in the roasting pan serve a twofold purpose:
  First, they allow the hot water to circulate under the souffle dish
  while baking to distribute the heat evenly; second, if using small
  ramekins, it stabilizes them and keeps them from moving around while
  baking.
  
  Yield: 5 servings.

      Title: Coconut Rum Punch
 Categories: Australian, Ceideburg 2

           Text Only
 
  Here, courtesy of Mark Herron in Sydney, is a series of recipes from
  Downunder.  These coconut recipes are from the Sydney Morning Herald
  9/29/92 from a cooking column titled "Raw Materials" by Meryl
  Constance. These are in an odd format, aside from being metric.
  There are no ingredient lists or amounts leading the body of the
  recipe.  I considered listing the ingredients first, but++since I use
  a non-standard format++ maybe someone with MM or one of the other
  recipe programs would rather put them into that format.  And no way
  am I going to try to translate the metric measurements into American
  ones.  Some of you whiz-kids with recipe programs with that feature
  conversions can tackle that.  As you'll see, these come from all over
  the world, not just from Australia. Mark++gotta couple of question on
  ingredients.  The rabbit recipe below calls for both red and green
  capsicums and birdseye chillies.  I know what the latter are, but are
  "capsicums" what we call green or red bell peppers up here? And I
  *think* that what are referred to as "brown onions" are probably the
  one's with brownish skins that we call "yello onions" here.
  
  And thanks for sending the papers over!  I getting a kick out of not
  only the recipes, but also the ads and articles.  A nice peek into
  Ozzie life.
  
  This is a version of an old recipe from Barbados.  You can use light
  or dark rum.  One of the ingredients is simple syrup which is made by
  dissolving 4 parts (any measure) sugar in 3 parts of water.  If you
  can't find a fresh young coconut, the chilled drinks cabinet in many
  Asian food stores contains young coconut juice, which has been frozen
  in plastic packs.
  
  Put into a cocktail shaker or mixing bowl 30 ml lime juice, 60 ml
  simple syrup, 90 ml rum.  120 ml young coconut- nut juice.  Shake or
  stir with ice cubes and strain into a tall glass.  Garnish with a
  lime leaf.
  
  Serves 1 (lavishly).

  2 1/2 c  Cold chicken broth, all fat

      3    To 5 tablespoons minced
           -cilantro
           Crisp tortilla chips to
           -accompany
 
  Place the onions in a blender or processor and add 1 cup of the Puree
  as fine as possible.  Peel and chunk in 2 1/2 of the avocados,
  reserving the remaining half for garnish.  Puree again, adding broth
  as necessary.
  
  Transfer the soup to a large bowl.  Add any remaining broth the
  buttermilk to the blender and whir briefly to pick as much avocado as
  possible. Add to the soup, along with the extract and sugar, if
  desired.
  
  Both of these rather surprising ingredients enhance avocado when used
  in tiny amounts.  Stir well, taste and adjust the salt.  The soup may
  be made to this in advance and refrigerated several hours, but for
  best flavor allow it to warm up a bit before serving.  It should be
  cold but not icy.
  
  Peel the remaining half avocado cut into very thin slices.  Divide
  soup-among six serving bowls and top with the sliced avocado, and
  coriander.  Serve accompanied by the tortilla chips.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      4 tb Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           Juice of 1 lemon
 
  Grabbed a little Danish cookbook at a sale this weekend.  After going
  through it I've decided that the Danes could give the Japanese a run
  for their money as far as strange and wonderful edibles go.  They
  depend heavily on fish and even have a version of sushi that I'll go
  into in some detail later in the packet.  There is also a hitherto
  unsuspected connection between Danish food and Mexican food.  It's
  really interesting to see how all these dishes from various countries
  inter-link.
  
  I ran across this early on in the Danish book and it raised my
  eyebrows enough to keep me going...
  
  Beat the eggs, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla together in the bowl
  the soup is to be served in.  Beat the buttermilk and fold in a
  little at a time.
  
  If you want to make something out of this dish, top the bowl with a
  cup of whipped cream.  Small cakes of oat meal, fried in butter and
  sugar, pressed into moistened eggs cups and turned onto a plate, are
  served with this dish.
  
  It can also be served after the main course with whipped cream,
  meringue and sweetened fruit.

  Joyce Jue comes through again!  You owe it to yourself to try this
  method of cooking if you like pork, Chinese food or both.  It's an
  absurdly simple way to produce delicious foods.  If you don't like
  pork, fix this using a chicken.
  
  Fresh ham or a fairly fat cut of pork is traditionally used for this
  recipe, but boneless lean pork loin makes a delicious and leaner
  substitute.  For a nontraditional presentation, serve the pork with
  grilled asparagus spears, Asian eggplant and/or zucchini slices.  Or,
  arrange the slices on a bed of watercress with strips of roasted
  pepper and serve as a first course salad.  Or, simply alternate the
  pork with thin rounds of chilled cucumber.
  
  Bring the water to a boil in a large pot, then add the pork, green
  onions, ginger, garlic and wine.  Bring to a boil again.  Skim off
  the scum that rises to surface.  Cover, reduce heat low and simmer
  for 45 minutes.
  
  When the meat is done, half fill a large pan with cold water and ice
  cubes. Remove the meat from the pot and immediately plunge it into
  the ice water; let sit for 20 minutes to firm up the meat and juices.
  Remove pork, pat dry, cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled,
  at least 2 to 3 hours, or overnight.
  
  GARLIC SESAME SAUCE:  Mix together all ingredients.
  
  To serve:  Cut the meat crosswise into paper-thin slices (no thicker
  than 1/8 inch) and arrange in a circular pattern on a plate.  Serve
  sauce on the side or drizzle it over the pork.  Garnish with fresh
  coriander leaves.

 Categories: Colombia, Game, Rabbit, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This recipe comes from Colombia in South America.  Rabbit meat is
  very low in fat and can be dry tasting, so it marries well with
  coconut cream. It is best to cook the rabbit gently till it is
  falling off the bone.
  
  Chop a rabbit into serving pieces.  Chop finely one large onion and 2
  cloves of garlic.  Seed and slice a large green capsicum, half a
  large red capsicum and finely slice 3 birdseye chillies (decrease the
  quantity and discard the seeds if you can't cope with too much chilli
  heat).  Peel and chop a large tomato and have ready 400 ml strong
  veal or chicken stock and 150 ml coconut cream.
  
  Heat a little oil in a frying pan and brown the rabbit pieces.
  Transfer them to a large saucepan.  In the remaining oil in the
  frying pan, saute the onions, capsicums and chillies.  Add to the
  saucepan with the tomato, salt and pepper to taste, and the stock.
  Bring just to simmering point, cover and cook very gently for about 2
  hours or even more. Lift the rabbit pieces out onto a dish and turn
  the heat up high under the saucepan. Reduce the liquid in the
  saucepan by about half.
  
  Lower the heat and stir in the coconut cream.  Return the rabbit
  pieces and cook gently, stirring, for a few minutes.  Serve with rice.

      4    Or 5 scallions
    1/2 lb Or so button mushrooms
      1 bn Parsley
      2    Eggs, beaten
           Salt
    1/2 lb Or so of soft butter
 
  The second dish, though it's equally cheap and good, takes a bit
  longer to fix.  It's a simple roast chicken with a stuffing of my own
  devising. The neat thing about it is that you put a nicely browned
  roast chicken on the table in front of admiring guests none of whom
  realize you've already had your meal++one better than they're about
  to partake of++though that one ain't bad either.
  
  First off, make the stuffing.  Toast the oatmeal bread about medium
  brown. When it pops up, let it sit in the toaster for a few minutes
  to dry out. Chop the scallions into pieces about 1/4-to 1/2-inch long.
  
  Slice the button mushrooms or cut them into quarters if they're
  small. Chop the parsley roughly.  Cut the dried toast into pices
  about 1/2 inch square. Put all these goodies into a large mixing
  bowl, add the eggs and mix well. Salt the stuffing to taste.  Use
  pepper too if you like it.  I sometimes also add Bell's Poultry
  Seasoning.
  
  At this point I reserve some of the stuffing++maybe a quarter or a
  third++and add the chopped giblets to it as I find that a lot of folks
  don't like them in the stuffing, hard as that may be to grasp.  But it
  works out good for me, as you'll see.  After the chicken is washed and
  dried, stuff the critter with the stuffing from the non-gibletted
  bowl.
  
  Back when I developed this dish++when I didn't know how to cook++I
  took the word at it's face value and *stuffed* the stuffing into the
  body cavity. Since then I've heard that it's considered good form to
  stuff it loosely to allow for expansion.  Don't listen to these lies.
  Stuff that sucker full!
  
  Heat the oven to between 350F and 400F.  Rub the chicken with butter
  and salt it.  Put the stuffed chicken, breast side up, on a roasting
  rack in a pan of some sort with sides about an inch or so high++a big
  pyrex cake pan works well.  I use one of those racks with the
  adjustable sides to hold the bird in place though anything will work
  except a vertical roaster.
  
  Now here's where the sly part comes in.  Have a fork or a pair of
  chopsticks handy.  I recommend chopsticks if you can use them.
  You'll see why in a minute.  Take the gibletted dressing and pack it
  all over the surface of the chicken, patting it into place.  Put the
  neck where you can reach it to baste it.  Dot the stuffing generously
  with pats of butter. (This ain't health food...) Put the bird into
  the oven and close the door. Don't look for about fifteen minutes or
  so.  Chat.  Entertain your guests. Pour them some more wine.
  
  After fifteen minutes you, as the cook, will be ready to begin one of
  the best meals of your life while your guests sit unsuspecting,
  waiting for the bird to be done.  When the time has elapsed, start
  basting with a bulb baster.  Do this regularly and religiously every
  five to ten minutes or so. Salt occasionally.  The stuffing and
  giblets on top of the chicken will start to brown as you baste it
  with the flavor laden combo of butter and chicken juices.  The toast
  bits will get crispy. The scallions will add their luscious juices to
  the basting liquid. The mushrooms will steam and beckon.  Soon you'll
  be picking off the browner bits and savoring them. Each time you open
  the oven, a new selection of bits will be ready for your delectation!
  Try to look harried and pained so your guests won't know how much fun
  you're having.
  
  Give them some more wine to keep them quite.  Have a little yourself.
  
  Maybe serve a salad or something...  If any of them get suspicious,
  tell them you're "adjusting the seasonings".  That should throw them
  off the track enough that none of them will be tempted to "help" you
  with that arduous task.  Heh, heh, heh...
  
  As you gradually clear the stuffing off the surface of the chicken
  the skin will begin to brown too.  Keep basting!  The chopsticks come
  in real handy now for retrieving the bits of mushrooms, giblets and
  whatever that fall down under the rack.  They can get in where it's
  hard to get a fork. The dish is done when all the stuffing coating
  the outside of the bird is in your stomach and the skin has turned a
  nice, crispy, savory golden brown. Take the chicken out, put it on
  the serving platter and de-stuff it. Serve with rolls, salads,
  veggies, mashed taters and gravy (made of course, with instant mashed
  potatoes)++whatever your guests like or whatever strikes your fancy.
  You won't care.  You'll already be full! I generally polish off a leg
  and a wing or so just for appearance's sake though. Oh yeah++and I
  always make the "sacrifice" and take the perfectly roasted, crispy
  skinned neck so my guest won't have to suffer through it...
  
  Two cautions.  One about the stuffing.  I love it, but it won't taste
  like traditional stuffings.  It will be redolent of mushrooms,
  parsley and scallions, very moist and++to my taste++quite nice.  I
  really like the taste of oatmeal bread.  Using other bread, you'd
  probably have to spiff up the seasonings a bit.  The other caution
  is++do not use garlic! Heresy, I know, to some folks, but I tried it
  and it disrupted the nice balance of flavors.
  
  For folks who like crispy skin, all the basting produces an excellent
  skin++full of flavor and crispy.  Good stuff++a meal in itself.

  Wash under running water to remove surface brine.
  
  Cover with boiling water and simmer, allowing about 1 hour per pound,
  or until a fork can penetrate to center.  Always slice corned beef
  very thin, diagonally across the grain.  A classic accompaniment of
  corned beef served hot is:
  
  Cabbage wedges simmered with the beef the last 15 minutes of cooking.
  Serve hot with: Horseradish Sauce Boiled Potatoes Gnocchi with Farina
  Serve corned beef cold with: Horseradish
  
  To press for slicing, cool the meat and force it into a deep pan;
  cover and refrigerate weighted.  The moisture pressed from the meat
  should form a jellied coating.
  
  After cooking corned beef as in 1, above, you may coat it with the
  following glaze and bake in a preheated 350F oven for 15 minutes or
  until the topping is set.
  
  Combine and mix well: 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 tablespoon water 1
  tablespoon soy sauce 2 teaspoons paprika 1/2 teaspoon ginger
  
  Tenderized corned beef can now be bought for oven roasting; follow

      Title: Cooking Rice on the Stove
 Categories: Chinese, Rice, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  This is gonna seem so simple that you won't believe that it will
  work, but it does.  The thing with rice cooking is that folks tend to
  make it too hard.  Get out a nice heavy pan with a tight fitting lid.
  (Visions is nice for this cause you can see what's going on in the
  pot.) Get a bag of normal ol' long grain rice++not Rice-A-Roni or
  Uncle Ben's or any of that "converted" stuff.  Dump as much into the
  pot as you like (one cup dry makes about three cups cooked).
  
  At this point, you can either rinse it or not.  If you don't the rice
  will be a tad stickier when done.  (That makes it good for eating with
  chopsticks.) If you rinse it well it will be a tad "fluffier".
  
  Personally, over the years I've come to NOT rinse my rice.  It's just
  too much work and I can't really see that much difference in the
  finished product.
  
  Level the rice in the pot and place your index finger so that it just
  touches the surface of the rice.  Add water until the level comes
  just up to the crease at the backside of the top of the first knuckle
  on your index finger.  Crank the heat up on the stove quite high and
  put the pot of rice on the burner.  Stir the rice lightly before it
  comes to a boil, just once, so it doesn't stick.  Let the shebang
  come to a full, rolling boil, then lower the heat to about medium.
  Let it boil, UNDISTURBED, until the free water evaporates and little
  holes appear in the surface of the rice.
  
  When this stage is reached, immediately lower the heat to the lowest
  setting possible (one of those "flame tamers" that you set on the
  burner can be helpful here), cover the rice and let it simmer and
  steam for about twenty minutes.  DO NOT LIFT THE LID UNTIL THE TIME
  HAS ELAPSED-DO NOT STIR THE RICE!!!  Sorry++didn't mean to shout.
  ;-} When the time has passed you will have a pot of perfectly cooked
  rice.  Fluff it a bit when you put it in the serving dish.  No
  complex procedures, no measurements and very little fuss and muss...
  
  This is an old Chinese method of cooking rice and it works regardless
  of the amount of rice used.  Just remember the "first knuckle rule"
  and things should work well.  I don't add salt to mine, but I don't
  imagine that it would cause any problems.  I've never cooked brown
  rice this way, but I imagine it would work if you doubled the
  steaming time. Another easy way to get perfect rice is to buy one of
  those Japanese rice cookers. They run around forty bucks and are
  really quite good at what they do. I'm using one made by Hitachi that
  works very well.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  By now, the only thing left of the side of veal is the chops, though
  fortunately you should have some left-over veal stock (it can be
  frozen as ice-cubes).  Here is a very simple, low-fat recipe from
  Larousse Light French Cooking (McGraw-Hill.  1981) which is
  unfortunately long out of print.
  
  Beat together one egg yolk with half a tablespoonful of evaporated
  skim milk.
  
  Slice 375 g of mushrooms.  Measure out 30 ml of brandy or whisky.
  Juice half a lemon.  Have ready about 4 tablespoons of veal stock.
  Chop 2 tablespoons of parsley.  Trim any fat From 6 veal chops and
  rub it over a large non-stick pan with a lid.  If there is no fat,
  brush on a little olive oil.
  
  Heat the pan and brown the chops on both sides, then add the stock.
  Meanwhile heat the cognac in a small saucepan, ignite it and pour it
  over the chops.  Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and
  cover.
  
  Cook just until the mushrooms have exuded their juices.  Remove the
  chops to a warm serving dish.
  
  Reduce the cooking juices a little, then add a spoonful or two of the
  juices to the egg yolk mixture, stirring.  Remove the frying pan from
  the heat and tip the egg yolk mixture into it, stirring.  Return the
  pan to a very gentle heat and stir until the sauce thickens.  It must
  not boil or it will curdle.  Add a dash of lemon juice and parsley,
  correct seasoning and spoon sauce over the chops.
  
  Larousse advises serving the chops with any dish of zucchini.

      Title: Country-Style Greens
 Categories: Creole, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 bn Fresh collard, turnip, or
           -mustard greens
      1 tb Lard or rendered bacon fat
      1 md Onion, minced
    1/4 lb Smoked slab bacon or ham *
      2 c  Water
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper, to taste
        ds Of Louisiana-style hot sauce
 
  * cut in 1/2-inch dices or 1/2 pound ordinary sliced bacon or ham
  
  Contrary to rumor, greens do not need hours of boiling in a sea of
  liquid, as this Mississippi recipe proves.  What they do need,
  however, is the flavor of smoked slab bacon or ham; if you must
  substitute ordinary bacon or ham, you'll need twice as much.  Greens
  are the traditional accompaniment to pork or ham; they also pair up
  well with corn bread or candied yams.
  
  1.  Trim away and discard the tough stems of greens.  To loosen grit,
  place the leaves and the remaining tender stems (you should have
  about 2 quarts) in a large bowl, cover with lukewarm water, and soak
  for 5 minutes. Rinse several times in lukewarm water to wash away any
  remaining sand.
  
  2.  Melt lard in a large, heavy, nonreactive pot with a lid.  (Do not
  use an aluminum pot; if possible, use one with an enamel coating.)
  Add onions and bacon.  Fry together over medium-high heat, stirring
  often, until onions wilt and bacon starts to brown (about 5 minutes).
  
  3.  Add greens and the water and bring to a boil over high heat.
  Cover, lower heat to medium, and cook until greens are tender, with
  just a little crunch (about 20 minutes).
  
  4.  Uncover, raise heat to high, and boil off some of the excess water
  (about 5 minutes).  Add salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste, and
  serve hot (dish should be slightly soupy).
  
  Serves 6.

  1 1/2 lb Fresh whole crab,
           -preferably live
      2 tb Peanut oil
      5    Unpeeled garlic cloves,
           -crushed
      2    Unpeeled fresh ginger
           -slices, 1/4 inch thick
      3    Whole scallions, cut into
           -2-inch pieces
      3 tb Fermented black beans
      2    Fresh red chili peppers,
           -seeded and shredded
      3 tb Rice wine
      2 tb Light soy sauce
    1/2 c  Rich Chicken Stock
 
  Well here it is, in all its glory.  I've included Hom's method for
  making stock both because it's good and to give more of a feel for
  the book. Honk Kong is an extremely, almost excessively dynamic city
  and this is reflected in the food.  The book is interesting because
  he has a finger on the development of the "new" Hong Kong cuisine and
  notes traditional recipes from which the ones in the book spring.
  
  BTW, Michael++my roommate++and I were talking about this dish last
  night as we were munching up a plain old steamed Dungeness crab.  He
  said he *really* liked this recipe.  I found it too heavy on the
  black beans and spices.  Here it is.  You be da judge...  ;-}
  
  Here is an interesting, innovative technique employed by Hong Kong
  chefs. The clay pot traditionally is used for the long simmering and
  braising of foods; nowadays, however it is as often used to infused
  intense flavors over high heat in a short length of time, as in this
  recipe. the classic Cantonese dish is given a new twist; the fresh
  crab is stir-fired with aromatic seasonings and then quickly finished
  over high heat in the covered clay pot.  The pungent black beans
  permeate the rich crab meat, enhancing it and adding to its subtle
  flavors.  This delicious casserole is quite easy to prepare and turns
  an ordinary dinner into a special occasion.
  
  If you are using a live crab, prepare it according to the technique
  on page 77.  [Rinse, scrub and steam for ten minutes.  S.C.] Cut the
  body into quarters and lightly crack the claws and legs.
  
  Heat a wok or large skillet until it is hot and add the oil.  Add the
  garlic, ginger, and scallions and stir-fry to flavor the oil.  Then
  add the black beans, chilies, and crab.  Stir-fry for2 minutes and
  add the chicken stock.  Turn the contents of the wok into a clay pot
  or casserole, cover, and cook over high heat for 5 more minutes or
  until the crab shell turns bright red.  Serve immediately.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: Cream of Wheat Of the Gods
 Categories: Cereals, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  What's so easy as Cream of Wheat you ask?  Well, consider this. It's
  much like rice in that it's a very bland, filling and wholesome food.
  Now everyone knows how hard it is to cook good rice, right?  Well,
  the same is true of Cream of Wheat, but if you follow these explicit
  directions, you will create a cereal masterpiece.  Don't be cowed by
  the fact that the procedure must be as rigidly followed as that of
  the Japanese tea ceremony. After a couple of years you're bound to
  get it right. Just follow the recipe on the box for however many
  servings you want, but do it in the following fashion.  (I consider a
  double serving to be enough for one person.) Do NOT use the recipe
  variation for using milk! This is an abominable perversion of the
  philosophy of Cream of Wheat and will give you much too rich a bowl
  of cereal.  I use "quick" Cream of Wheat. Although all three
  varieties seem to taste pretty much the same when cooked I feel
  guilty using the "instant" and am too impatient to use the "regular",
  so "quick" is just fine.  The auxiliary ingredients are important too.
  Fer'instance, if you can't get the proper brand of bread, you'd best
  move on to the next recipe.  1 box Cream of Wheat (make two servings
  for each person), Salt, Water 4 slices of Northridge oatmeal bread
  for each person, Butter slightly chilled in the fridge (any normal,
  salted butter will do), Sugar (white granulated ONLY!), Milk (any
  type but chocolate or buttermilk). UTENSILS: A medium sized
  Revere-ware copper bottomed pan. Some flexibility is allowed here.
  'Visions' can be used too. A Pyrex measuring cup. Other types may be
  substituted. An old fashioned glass sugar dispenser++the kind with a
  metal top and a little flap that covers the hole.  You can fudge on
  this too, but you're skirting dangerously close to loosing the
  authenticity of the dish, especially if you've already compromised
  and used 'Visions' to cook the cereal... A table knife. Throw caution
  to the winds and use any type you like, except a steak knife. A
  spoon.  The pattern isn't important, but the plainer it is the
  better. A bowl. Use only a thick, diner-style, ceramic one. A glass
  for milk. A jelly glass would be ideal. PROCEDURE: First toast the
  bread. Set the toaster so the bread is well toasted. Small charred
  areas around the edge are perfectly acceptable. Let it sit in the
  toaster for a moment to crisp up a bit, then set it aside to cool. It
  MUST be room temperature (a cool room, at that) when buttered so that
  the butter does not melt. Next, make the Cream of Wheat.  Boil the
  water, salt it, then take a wooden spoon and briskly stir the boiling
  water counter clockwise while dribbling in the Cream of Wheat from
  the Pyrex measuring cup.  Don't rush the process or you risk lumpy
  Cream of Wheat!  (I once fixed this for a person who liked lumpy
  Cream of Wheat.  I couldn't get it to lump!) Turn down the heat and
  let the stuff simmer, bubbling gently, until it's approaching the
  proper consistency.  Well, since you asked, the proper consistency is
  thick enough so that a swirl made in the surface will slowly subside.
  Stir it every so often.  Once the proper thickness is reached, take
  it off the heat and stir vigorously several times to release the
  steam and thicken it up a bit more. The reason for this will be
  obvious in a moment. After, and only after, the Cream of Wheat is
  done, butter the toast with the slightly chilled butter. This will
  allow the cereal to cool so it will be ready to eat when you are. The
  butter should be chilled just to the point where is holds its shape
  but is not hard to spread++very important! I tend to favor a
  moderately lavish amount of butter, but this is up to personal taste.
  Margarine is NOT, NOT, NOT acceptable in this preparation. Put the
  toast on a plate and dish up the cereal.  Get the milk out of the
  fridge and grab the sugar and put everything on the table.  The table
  can be either formica or wood++the recipe is very flexible in this
  regard. Place the plate with the toast to the upper right of the bowl
  (or upper left if you're left handed). Pour a glass of milk and put
  it to the left (or right) side of the plate of toast. Now, take a
  moment after you sit down and savor the sight in front of you. Then
  get up and get a roll of paper towels.  Reseat yourself. Next, gently
  pour a tablespoon or two of milk into the bowl with the Cream of
  Wheat and stir it in.  This will complete the cooling and add just a
  hint of richness to the Spartan simplicity of water cooked Cream of
  Wheat. Now sprinkle a light dusting of the sugar over the surface of
  the cereal. It will slightly glaze and become transparent. Take a
  piece of the toast and break off a chunk that is comfortably bite
  sized. Using the toast as an edible spoon, reverently scoop up a
  dollop of the sugar glazed cereal with the toast and pop it into your
  mouth. (Do NOT use the spoon to eat the cereal. It's only for
  stirring in the milk initially.) Paying close attention, respectfully
  chew the morsel. All the while be aware of how the cool, creamy
  smoothness of the butter slowly melts from the warmth of the cereal.
  Note the satisfying crunch of the oatmeal bread as contrasted to the
  rich plasticity of the cereal. Contrast the blandness of the cereal
  to the slightly charred, nutty flavor of the toast. Marvel at how
  such mundane ingredients can create such a symphony of tastes and
  textures. Continue in this fashion, working clockwise around the
  bowl, until the entire glazed surface of the cereal is gone, then
  sprinkle more sugar on and repeat the process. If you've done
  everything right, the four slices of toast will disappear at exactly
  the same moment as the last smidgen of cereal. Now sit back for a
  moment and bemoan the fact that the experience is over. Dab
  resignedly at your lips with paper towel, fold it neatly and put into
  the empty bowl to signify the end of the meal.  Heave a deep sigh of
  contentment and give thanks for the fact that you live in America,
  that great country that has made possible this pinnacle of gustatory
  delight! Wash the dishes. Posted by Stephen Ceideburg; December 24

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 bn Of English spinach or
      1    Of silverbeet
      1    White bread roll, soaked in
           -water *
      3 tb Oil
      4 tb Plain flour
           Stock (or milk)
      2    Cloves of garlic, finely

           Salt
 
  * (or milk when serving a dairy-based meal)
  
  Wash the spinach thoroughly, slice and put it into a saucepan over
  brisk heat.  (The spinach will cook in the water still on the
  leaves.) Cook until limp and tender.  Squeeze the liquid out of the
  roll and sieve the roll and the spinach together or blend them to a
  puree in a food processor.
  
  In a saucepan, gently heat 3 tablespoons oil, add the garlic and when
  it is bubbling add the plain flour to make a paste or roux.  Stir
  over the heat until the roux changes colour to beige.  Add the
  spinach mixture and enough stock or milk to make a thickish sauce,
  stirring all the time until bubbles break the surface.  Add salt to
  taste and continue to cook, stirring, for a few more minutes.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: Creme Aux Bimbrelles (Blueberry Cream)
 Categories: French, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Always thought that Irma la Douce was a bimbrelle.  Imagine my
  surprise when I found out a bimbrelle is a type of huckleberry...
  
  From the Lorraine region in northern France, this traditional recipe
  utilises a variety of huckleberry called bimbrelle which grows wild
  in the forests of the Vosges.  However, it is, if anything, better
  made with cultivated blueberries.
  
  Put 750 g of blueberries into a saucepan and reduce to 1 cup or so of
  very thick puree.  Strain the puree, then add 175 g sugar and the
  juice of a lemon.  Stir well to dissolve.
  
  Melt 7 g gelatine in a tablespoon or so of water in a double boiler
  over simmering water.  Add the gelatine to the berry puree, then add
  200 fresh, whole blueberries.  Refrigerate, keeping a close eye on
  the mixture, and meanwhile whip 250 mL cream till barely mounding.
  As soon as the gelatin shows signs of setting, fold in the cream then
  turn the mixture into an oiled mould and refrigerate at least 4 hours.
  
  Serve with more lightly whipped cream, sweetened and flavoured with 1
  tablespoon of cognac.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

    1/2 c  Cream
      2 ts Arrowroot (optional)
      2 tb Minced parsley
      1 tb Minced cilantro
 
  This chicken and vegetable soup is an Argentinean classic.  It is as
  thick as a stew and as creamy as a bisque.
  
  Preheat oven to 400F.
  
  Spread half of the onions in a large, deep baking dish.  Place
  chicken on top.  Season with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle garlic, thyme
  and bay leaves over chicken.  Spread remaining onions on top; drizzle
  with 1 cup stock. Roast uncovered for 30 minutes, or until chicken
  turns golden around the edges.
  
  Place chicken (remove skin, if desired), onions, garlic and herbs in a
  6-quart soup pot.  Deglaze roasting pan with some water or stock and
  add to the pot.  Add the remaining stock and the potatoes to the pot.
  
  Simmer for 15 minutes, then add the carrots and corn.  Simmer for 25
  minutes.
  
  Using a wide fork, roughly mash at least 4 of the "falling apart"
  potato chunks to help thicken the soup.
  
  Beat egg yolk into the cream, then beat in 1/2 cup of the stock from
  the soup pot.  Blend in the arrowroot if you want a thicker soup.
  Pour the cream mixture back into the soup, stirring until
  well-blended.
  
  Just before serving, add the minced parsley and cilantro.  Ladle into
  wide, deep soup bowls.  Make sure each bowl has a chunk of potato, a
  piece of chicken, a couple of carrots and a piece of corn.
  
  Serves 6.

 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 head
 
      1    Pig's head, cleaned and

      1 ts 5-spice powder
      2 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Mien see (ground brown bean
           -sauce) or 1/2 cup oyster
           -sauce
    1/4 c  Bourbon
      1 c  Honey, combined with
      1 c  Boiling water
 
  Remove any hair on head by singeing over and open flame or plucking.
  Scrub well (using a vegetable brush, if desired) and then sprinkle
  with salt, rubbing it into the skin.  Rinse well with cool water; pat
  dry. Remove any excess fat.
  
  Place head in a colander in the sink and pour a kettle full of boiling
  water over.  Let cool.
  
  Combine the 5-spice powder, salt, bean sauce and bourbon.  Slash the
  meat on underside of head and rub half of the spice mixture into the
  meat. Rub the remaining spice mixture onto the skin.  Place head
  upright on a rack in a large baking pan.  Bake at 375F for 1 1/2
  hours.  Lower heat to 325F and continue cooking for an additional 2
  hours, or until the meat is cooked through, basting the skin well
  every 30 minutes with the honey-water mixture.  (Cooking time will
  depend on the size of the head.) If ears begin to brown too quickly
  during cooking period, wrap them with foil.
  
  When head is done, remove to platter and garnish with watercress or
  coriander.  Chop head into pieces and serve with sweet vegetable
  relish or plum sauce.
  
  [I'd definitely serve with spiced salt and Chinese mustard and minced
  green onions for dipping too.]

  Here's another of the Winners series.  This one might be a bit time
  consuming, buy there aren't any really exotic ingredients and, unless
  you get into garnishing it the way it shows in the book, not too much
  hassle. These are "mock" chicken legs++a minced mixture of meat and
  seafood rolled up and deep fried.  I'd use the rice paper option for
  wrappers as they are readily available, at least around here.  The
  basket garnish is an incredibly fussy little number actually woven
  from strips of potatoes. I'd use the two seive potato nest trick for
  that part if I bothered at all. The small crabs that go into the
  basket really are small crabs++ about two inches across the shell.
  They look neat, but add nothing to the dish aside from that.

  Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award - Meat "South of the
  Yangtse River Crispy Leg" sounds prosaic in English, but to a Chinese
  the geographic description has many happy associations++ scenic
  beauty, ancient traditions, a land where poets found peace.  The
  promise of crispy legs in the dish evokes the image of Cantonese
  favorite - crispy chicken drumsticks yet the diner senses that there
  is a surprise treat in the dish.
  
  1.  Optional basket garnish:  Steam crabs and put aside.  Form
  potatoes into basket shapes.  This can be done by peeling them into
  long strips, which are then interwoven', and sealed with cornstarch
  paste. Deep-fry baskets over medium flame until golden. 2. Slice all
  filling ingredients at an angle, and cut into dia- mond shapes (which
  creates a better texture). Season with seasoning mixture. 3. Slice
  bamboo shoots into 12 strips each 5 cms long and 0.5 cms wide. 4.
  Divide pork caul lining into 12 triangular pieces (large enough to
  wrap "legs"). Cut ham into 24 strips. On to each pork caul lining lay
  one sprig of coriander, 2 strips of ham, and 1/12 of the diamond-cut
  filling ingredients. Place one strip of bamboo shoot on top, with
  half of it left outside wrapping. Fold and mould each filled pork
  caul lining into leg shape. 5. Mix coating ingredients with 2 tbs
  water, and coat each "leg" with the paste. 6. Mix Hoisin sauce with
  water, and simmer till thickened.
  
  To cook Carefully slide "legs" into medium-hot oil (sufficient to
  deep-fry all twelve at same time), with folded "leg" ends facing
  centre of wok. Deep-fry for 3 minutes, then increase heat a little
  and continue deep- frying for a further 3 minutes.
  
  To present 1. Lay "legs" on a paper doily in serving dish, arranging
  the potato baskets and crabs as a central garnish. 2. Serve the
  Hoisin sauce mixture on the side. From "Champion Recipes of the 1986

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Brown rice flour +
           -additional for dusting
           -loaves
  1 1/2 ts Granulated yeast
      2    Tesapoons sugar
  1 1/2 c  Warm water (110F)
      1 c  Corn flour
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
      2 ts Xantham gum powder
      1    To 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
      2 lg Eggs, at room temperature
      1 tb Corn oil
 
  Here's a couple of off beat bread recipes I thought might interest
  you. This and the following recipe are wheat free breads.
  
  Combine 1/2 cup of the rice flour, the yeast, sugar and 1/2 cup of
  the warm water in a 2-cup glass measure; stir to combine, then let
  rest in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.
  
  Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and draw two 8-inch
  circles on it.
  
  Combine remaining 1/2 cup rice flour, corn flour, cornstarch, xanthan
  gum powder and salt in a large bowl; mix to blend.
  
  Beat eggs lightly; set aside 1 tablespoon for brushing tops of
  loaves. Add remaining 1 cup warm water and the corn oil to beaten
  eggs. Using a wooden spoon, stir egg and yeast mixtures into flour
  and beat until smooth. Using a rubber spatula, spread soft dough into
  circles on marked parchment paper, heaping it up slightly in the
  center.
  
  Cover loaves lightly with greased plastic wrap and let rise until
  doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Preheat oven to 425F.
  
  Beat a few drops of water into the reserved beaten egg and brush over
  loaves.  Dust lightly with rice flour.  Using a razor blade, slash
  tops of loaves into a large diamond grid pattern.  (Use an
  up-and-down cutting motion rather than dragging the blade through the
  soft dough.)
  
  Bake for 20 minutes, until well browned.
  
  Makes two 8-inch diameter, 11-ounce loaves.

      Title: Cucumber and Coconut Raita
 Categories: Indian, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 5 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Got some cucumbers languishing in the fridge?  Probably won't be
  after you see the next four posts...
  
  Raitas or yoghurt salads provide a cool and refreshing contrast to hot
  curries in an Indian meal.  However, raitas like this one can also be
  used as a dip for crudites or as a light lunch served with naan or
  paratha breads.
  
  Peel 500 g cucumber and halve lengthwise. out the seeds and slice the
  cucumber finely, about 3 mm thick.
  
  Have ready a large pot of boiling water and bowl of ice-cold water.
  Drop the cucumber to the boiling water for 2 minutes, then scoop out
  and into the cold water.  (Using a deep-fry basket makes this
  easier.) Drain the cucumber and dry it thoroughly.
  
  In a bowl, mix 500 mL yoghurt (low fat can used), salt to taste, 1
  tablespoon finely chopped parsley, 2 tablespoons of finely chopped
  dill, 2 tablespoons of toasted and chopped walnuts or pecan nuts, 1/3
  cup of grated fresh coconut (or use dried shredded coconut pre
  moistened with about one and a tablespoons of boiling water) and 1
  hot chopped finely.
  
  When well blended, stir in the the cucumber.
  
  Heat a tablespoon of oil in a small pan, then add two teaspoons of
  black mustard seeds.  When the mustard seeds sizzle and turn grey,
  tip seeds and oil into the cucumber mixture and stir well.
  Refrigerate for an hour or so to allow the flavours to blend.
  
  Makes 5 or 6 servings.

 Categories: Indian, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This ultra-simple entree depends absolutely on the quality of its
  ingredients.  The cucumbers must be at their peak, the goat cheese
  the best you can buy and the oil hazelnut if possible but, in any
  case, a well-flavoured nut oil.  As hazelnut oil can be difficult to
  find, you could substitute a walnut or macadamia nut oil.
  
  Score 750 g of cucumbers lengthwise with the tines of a fork or peel
  them if you prefer.  Slice paper thin, put in a colander, sprinkle
  with salt and let them degorge for half an hour.
  
  Turn out of the colander, rinse and dry with paper towels.  In a bowl
  toss the slices with 50 mL lemon juice, then arrange them on six
  plates. Dust with white pepper.
  
  Cut about 100 to 120 g firm goat cheese into thin slices and arrange
  two or three on each plate.  Sprinkle 50 mL of hazelnut oil over the
  six servings.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: Cultivating a Taste for Ground Cherry Pie
 Categories: Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 c  Ground cherries
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 ts Quick cooking tapioca
           Handful all-purpose flour
           Juice of 1 large lemon
           Pastry for a double-crust
           -9-inch pie
      2 tb Butter
           BY JEFF COX
 
  One of the joys of making a kitchen garden is getting to grow and
  taste new and unusual varieties of vegetables.
  
  Unfamiliar vegetables are like unfamiliar people.  They take time to
  get to know.  Lack of understanding can lead to mistakes takes.  So I
  put most of my energy into growing my own garden tested favorites,
  and limit the number of unfamiliar varieties in each garden to just
  one or two.
  
  Elusive Habits: One year I tried ground cherries, Physalis pruinosa,
  which produce tiny tomato-like fruits in papery husks on low, lanky,
  herbaceous bushes. I planted them in a corner of the garden that
  didn't get much traffic, and never did see them sprout, or see them
  growing during the summer, either. I thought they died from neglect.
  
  When things thinned out later in the year, I discovered that the
  whole area was covered with the trailing vines of the ground
  cherries, and there were enough fruits to make an intensely-flavored
  and very wigged-out ground cherry pie.
  
  Ground cherries also are known as husk tomatoes, and are a smaller,
  more flavorful cousin of the tomatillo (Physalis ixocarpa) used in
  Mexican salsa verde.  They're also related to the Hawaiian poha
  (Physalis peru viana).
  
  They like the same conditions as tomatoes, and thus will do best in
  the portions of the Bay Area that stay warmest at night.  However, if
  you can grow tomatoes, you can grow ground cherries, and they're
  worth a try. They always pull their disappearing act if grown among
  other plants.
  
  They like to drape their long trailing branches over their neighbors'
  leaves, and run down among long grasses.  Only becoming visible when
  the other plants die back late in the year.
  
  The plants are sprawling and grow about 18 inches tall.  Their
  flowers are inconspicuous little bells less than a half-inch long,
  whitish yellow with brown spots.  They set fruit sparingly until mid-
  season, when they finally produce large clusters of fruit that
  develop inside green ish husks. These dry when ripe to a lacy brown
  paper.  The fruits are green and unpalatable until ripe, when they
  turn a rich golden yellowish brown.
  
  Small But Sweet: The fruits are the size of blueberries, and are
  intensely sweet with a low acid finish. They're surprisingly savory
  and good for preserves, although I prefer them in a
  once-every-five-years version of ground cherry pie. More often than
  that, and I get squeamish.
  
  Order ground cherry seed from Nichols Garden Nursery, 1190 North
  Pacific Highway, Albany, Oregon 97321.  A packet plus handling charge
  is $1.65. You'll enjoy having the Nichols catalog of herbs and rare
  seeds, too. [This info may be dated++the article is three years old.
  S.C.]
  
  Plant the seeds in the spring in an out-of-the-way part of the garden
  and make sure the area is not allowed to undergo severe water stress.
  Ground cherries are hardy, but not drought-proof.  They'll grow in
  any good garden soil.
  
  If you can avoid eating them all out of hand, try the pie. Jeff Cox,
  a Bay Area resident, an editor and writer for Rodale Press and author
  of several gardening books.
  
  Directions Gently mix together. ground cherries, sugar, tapioca,
  flour and lemon juice.  Let stand for 15 minutes while you line a
  9-inch pie pan with half of the pastry.
  
  Preheat the oven to 450 F.  Turn the fruit, mixture into the pastry-
  lined pan, and dot the top with the butter.  Cover with a
  well-pricked top crust or lattice work of dough.
  
  Bake at 450F for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350F and bake for
  another 40 minutes, or until golden brown.

      1 lg Onion
           Parsley
    1/3 c  Flour
      1 tb Butter
      1    Scant teaspoon curry
 
  One large or two small eels are suitable for 4 persons.  Skin the
  eel, cut in pieces as long as a finger and put in boiling salt water
  with a top of parsley.  Use water enough to cover only half the fish,
  so the stock will be good and strong.  Cook the eel until it is
  tender and keep it hot while making the sauce.  Melt butter in a pot,
  brown a large onion and add flour and curry.  Dilute with the fish
  stock until the sauce is thick enough. Taste it, and if it is not
  strong enough add more curry. Pour it over the eel, serve in a deep
  dish and have an extra dish of fluffy steamed rice.

 Categories: Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8    Lamb chops, preferably from
           -the rack, about 2 lbs
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper to taste
      1 tb Curry powder
      1 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Butter
      2 tb Finely chopped shallots
    1/3 c  Dry white wine
    1/2 c  Fresh or canned chicken
           -broth
      1 ts Tomato paste
      1 tb Finely chopped parsley
 
  Lamb is one of the greatly under-utilized meats here in the US, I
  think. There are a variety of recipes from around the world to
  inspire you. Actually, I was looking for my Mongolian lamb recipe but
  don't have it typed in (just use any ol' Mongolian beef recipe and
  substitute lamb for the beef and don't over cook it).
  
  Sprinkle the chops on both sides with salt and pepper.  Rub them on
  both sides with curry powder to coat evenly.
  
  Heat oil in a skillet large enough to hold the chops in one layer.
  Add the chops and cook until browned on one side, about 2 minutes.
  Turn and brown on second side, about 2 minutes.  Turn onto the fatty
  rims and continue cooking until the rims are rendered of fat, about 2
  minutes.
  
  Turn the chops flat side down and cook, turning them occasionally.
  The total cooking time should be about 15 minutes.  Transfer the
  chops to a dish and pour off all the fat from the skillet.
  
  Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the skillet and heat.  Add the
  shallots and cook, stirring, about 15 seconds.  Add the wine and
  bring to a boil. Cook for about 1 minute and then add the chicken
  broth and tomato paste. Cook over moderately high heat until reduced
  to about 1/3 cup. Swirl in the remaining butter and pour the sauce
  over the chops. Serve sprinkled with parsley.
  
  Serves 4.

  I cook lamb occasionally in my Asian recipes, but not often as no one
  but myself likes it here.  The main thing to remember about lamb is
  that it should be medium rare.  Actually, I like it seared on the
  outside and nearly raw in the middle, but these days that's not such
  a hot idea. Heat oil in a heavy skillet with a tight-fitting lid.
  Add shanks and brown slowly on all sides.  Remove shanks form pan.
  Add flour and curry powder to drippings and blend well; add water and
  wine, stirring, until thickened.
  
  Return shanks to pan, season with salt, garlic salt and pepper.  Top
  with onions.  Cover and simmer gently for 1 1/2 hours until tender.

      1 tb Chopped fresh basil
 
  The photo of this recipe looks wonderful too.  Whole shelled mussels
  in a white "curry" sauce along with slices of button mushrooms and
  other goodies.  The curry isn't what we would normally think of as a
  curry++ there isn't any curry powder called for (though it would
  probably be good).
  
  1:  Scrub mussels under cold running water; remove beards.  Combine
  mussels and water in large saucepan, cover, bring to boil, reduce
  heat, simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Drain mussels,
  remove and discard shells; reserve mussels.
  
  2:  Place chillies in small bowl, cover with boiling water, let stand
  for 10 minutes; drain and chop chillies.  Heat ghee in medium frying
  pan, add chillies, ginger, garlic, lemon grass and shallots, stir
  over medium heat for about 2 minutes or until shallots are soft.
  
  3:  Stir in coconut milk, sauce and sugar, bring to boil, reduce heat,
  simmer, uncovered, for 1 minute.  Stir in mushrooms, cook over medium
  heat for 1 minute.  Blend flour with extra water, stir into mushroom
  mixture, stir over high heat until sauce boils and thickens.
  
  4:  Stir in mussels and basil, stir over medium heat until heated
  through.
  
  Serves 4.

  This version of a Malaysian classic is both rich and subtle.
  
  Furthermore, with a food processor, it is quite simple to prepare.
  Disjoint a chicken, then chop the resulting pieces in half.  In a
  food processor, process the flesh of half a small coconut to shreds.
  
  Toast it, stirring, in a dry frying pan until it is light brown.
  Return it to the processor and process it with 700 ml thin coconut
  milk.  Set aside.
  
  Wash the processor bowl and blade, and process to a paste 2 brown
  onions, 6 cloves garlic, 5 fresh red chillies, 2 cm ginger, 2 cm
  cinnamon stick, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, 2 tablespoons coriander, 2
  teaspoons cummin, a pinch of mustard seeds, 1 teaspoon cardamom, 1
  teaspoon turmeric and a 2 cm cube of blachan (dark, hardened shrimp
  paste).  Juice a lemon.
  
  Heat 3 tablespoons of oil or copha (coconut fat) in a saucepan and
  fry the spice paste until it smells fragrant.  Add the chicken
  pieces, the coconut mixture and the lemon juice and simmer without a
  lid for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
  
  Serve with rice and garnish with deep fried onion flakes.

  I *think* this came from Sunset Magazine.  There's nothing hot in the
  ingredient list, but it would be real easy to put some cayenne or
  mashed up chili peppers in the marinade.  Probably more authentic as
  well.
  
  This attractive Thai presentation looks best with shrimp with their
  heads still attached.  Try it with large tiger prawns or fresh
  carids. Pound the garlic, shallot, galangal and lemon grass to a
  paste in a mortar with a pinch of salt.  Transfer to a shallow bowl
  and stir in the lemon juice, soy sauce and wine.
  
  Using a small knife or scissors, split the shrimp shells down the
  back, but leave attached.  (If the heads are present, carefully
  separate the shell where the tail joins the head, then split the tail
  shell open.) Devein if necessary.  Toss in the marinade and let stand
  for 30 minutes to 3 hours.
  
  Thread single shrimp lengthwise on skewers, starting at the tail end
  and coming out through the head.  Push the skewer on through until

      Title: Danish Pastry (Dansk Wienerbrod)
 Categories: Danish, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2    Yeast cakes (2 1/4 OZ.)
      1 c  Milk
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 c  Butter
 
  Sift flour and mix with sugar and salt.  Mix yeast with a little cold
  milk. Add this, the rest of the milk and the beaten egg to flour and
  sugar. Beat well until smooth with a wooden spoon.
  
  Roll out the dough on baking board to 1 finger thickness.  Spread
  small pieces of butter on 2/3 of the dough.  The butter must have same
  consistency as the dough; if it is too soft it melts into the dough.
  
  Fold together into three layers like folding a napkin, first the part
  without butter.  Roll out and fold again.  Repeat three or four times.
  
  Leave in a cold place for 1/2 hour.  This is the dough with which many
  different kinds of Danish pastry is made.  When pastry is shaped,
  place on baking sheet and leave in cold place to rise for 15 to 20
  minutes, then brush with egg white and bake in a fast oven until
  golden brown.
  
  COCKS' COMBS (HANEKAMME):  Roll out dough to finger thickness and
  spread with a paste made of equal parts of butter and sugar, then cut
  into square pieces 4" x 4".  Place filling across middle and fold
  over.
  
  Press the edges firmly together and make 4 or 5 deep slashes in this
  side. Let rise, brush with egg white and spread with chopped almonds
  and sugar.
  
  SPANDAURERS:  Roll out dough, spread with paste and cut as above.
  Place filling in middle.  Fold corners to the center and press down.
  After baking drop 1 teaspoon of jelly in the center and spread with
  frosting of confectioner's sugar and water.
  
  CHOCOLATE BUNS (CREMEBOLLER):  Roll out dough, spread with paste and
  cut as above.  Place filling of vanilla creme in middle, fold corners
  to the center, forming dough as a ball and place upside down on
  baking sheet. After baking spread with frosting of confectioner's
  sugar, cocoa and water.
  
  As filling may be used apple sauce, jelly, prunes, vanilla creme or
  almond paste:
  
  VANILLA CREME:  Mix 1 egg yolk, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 tablespoon
  flour and 3/4 cup milk and cook until thick.  Take off, add 1/2
  teaspoon vanilla extract and cool stirring occasionally.
  
  ALMOND PASTE:  Cream 1/2 cup butter, add 1/4 lb. ground, blanched
  almonds and 1/2 cup sugar and mix well until smooth.  Another kind of
  almond paste without butter is made of:  1/4 lb. almonds, 1/2 cup
  sugar and 3 egg whites.  Work well together until smooth.

 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  A colleague who recently visited the Darley Street Thai at its new
  location in Bayswater Road, Kings Cross, described this dish as
  "exquisite". Though the recipe may seem dauntingly lengthy, most of
  it is simply a long list of ingredients for red curry paste, which
  can be made in quantity and stored in a container in the fridge for 3
  to 4 weeks for further use. Frozen kaffir limes can be bought very
  cheaply in good Asian stores, where the rest of the ingredients
  listed should also be available. Grate the limes for zest while they
  are stir frozen.
  
  In a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind to a powder 10 white
  peppercorns and a few sheaves of mace.  Roast 1 teaspoon of Thai
  shrimp paste by zapping it in a microwave oven or putting it on a
  little piece of foil under the grill.
  
  Put the pepper-mace mixture and the shrimp paste in a blender (David
  recommends a blender but some of us will have to make do with a food
  processor or the mortar and pestle) and add 3 to 5 long red dried
  chillies, deseeded, washed and chopped, 4 cloves of true shallots,
  (or substitute the same quantity of Spanish onion), 1/2 stalk of
  lemon grass, sliced, 1 teaspoon galangal. peeled and chopped, 1/2
  teaspoon kaffir lime zest, 1 tablespoon of coriander root, scraped
  and chopped, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a little water.  Process to a
  very fine paste.  This may take up to 10 minutes.  Transfer to a
  storage jar.
  
  In a medium-size pan, boil 250mL coconut cream over high heat,
  stirring constantly, until the oil separates out, about 3 to 5
  minutes.
  
  (If using canned coconut cream, don't shake the can -use the solid
  mass of coconut at the top of the can, plus as much of the rest as
  you need to make up 250mL.  If it doesn't separate within 5 minutes,
  add a tablespoon of oil.) Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of red curry paste
  and fry for 5 minutes, stirring, until fragrant.  Add 1 tablespoon
  fish sauce, 1/2 tablespoon palm sugar and fry until colour deepens.
  Add 24 Coffin Bay scallops (12 if other dishes will be served
  simultaneously) and 125mL coconut milk.
  
  Check for sweet-sour balance.  Throw in 5 kaffir lime leaves,
  shredded, 1 large fresh red chilli, julienned, and 2 tablespoons of
  either coriander or basil leaves.  Serve with jasmine rice.

      Title: Deep-Fried Squid
 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 lb Squid, cleaned and cut into
           -rings
           Flour for coating, at least
           -3 cups
           Salt and pepper to taste
           Oil for deep frying. Peanut
           -oil is best.
 
  Deep-fried squid is one of the most popular seafood dishes in the
  world. It is made in almost every country where squid is eaten.  Once
  you taste it, you'll see why.  The rings emerge juicy, sweet and
  crisp.
  
  Served with several dipping sauces, this dish makes an excellent hors
  d'oeuvre or main course.  This recipe calls for a dry coating.  Wet
  coatings, such as tempura batter, are delicious, too, though they are
  a little more trouble to apply.
  
  Dry the rings thoroughly with paper towels.  Coat with flour, to
  which salt and pepper have been added.
  
  Heat oil to 350F in a deep-fat fryer or heavy casserole.  If you
  don't have a temperature control or thermometer, you can guess at the
  temperature by dropping a few drops of water into the oil.  It should
  sizzle immediately on contact.  Plunge basket laden with one layer of
  squid into oil which should bubble vigorously on contact.  If you
  don't have a basket for deep frying, use a large spoon or tongs to
  immerse squid in oil, and to remove. Fry until coating turns golden
  brown, about 3 or 4 minutes.
  
  Remove squid and drain.  Turn down heat to moderate until just before
  you are ready to cook the next batch; oil will overheat when the
  fryer is empty.  Remove excess oil from squid with paper towels.
  
  Serve rings hot with any of the dipping sauces described below or with
  lemon wedges.  Cole slaw is a natural with deep fried squid.

  denser.
  
  1:  Wrap tofu in 3 sheets of absorbent paper, weigh down with plate;
  let stand for 4 hours.
  
  2:  Just before serving, cut tofu into 2cm cubes.  Deep fry cubes in
  hot oil in batches until well browned; drain on absorbent paper.
  Serve hot with warm peanut sauce.
  
  3:  Peanut Sauce:  Combine coriander root, chilli, garlic, sugar and
  vinegar in pan, stir over heat until sugar is dissolved.  Stir in
  peanut buffer and coconut milk, stir until heated through.  Serve
  sprinkled with fresh coriander and chilli, if desired.
  
  Makes 6 servings.
  
  Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Storage: Covered, in refrigerator.

      1 kg (2 lb) topside (beef)

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Dark soya sauce

MMMMM---------------------------BUMBU--------------------------------
     10    Shallots
      4    Red chillis (or 2 tbs
           -Sambal Ulek)
      2 tb Vegetable oil
           Salt
      1 tb Lemon or fresh lime juice
 
  * Cut the beef fairly thin and trim it into small, square pieces.
  Marinate it for 1 hour or longer. Remember that pedas=hot++spicy hot!
  This is fried beef, with a robust flavour of chilli. Slice the
  shallots finely. Seed and slice the chillis.  Fry them in a
  tablespoonful of oil, in a wok, stirring all the time until they are
  golden brown. Add salt to taste. Keep hot. Put a tablespoonful of oil
  in a thick frying-pan, and fry the slices of meat a few at a time.
  Three minutes on each side will be ample*. When all the pieces are
  cooked, put them into the wok with the shallots and chilli. Heat, and
  mix well.  Sprinkle over the mixture 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice,
  or, better still, fresh lime juice.  Stir, and add more salt if
  necessary.  Serve hot, with rice. * NOTE: In Indonesia, the meat is
  usually fried until crisp.  You can even buy sun-dried dendeng which
  only needs coating with bumbu and frying. Crisp dendeng can be rather
  tough, and I prefer it as described above; however, a purist might
  say that my recipe is not 'genuinely' Indonesian. Makes 6 servings.

      Title: Deviled Chicken with Mustard Coating
 Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2    Butterflied chickens
           The mustard and herb coating
           The cooking juices from the
           -chicken
      6 tb Dijon-style prepared mustard
  3 1/2 tb Finely minced shallot or
           -scallion
    1/2 ts Tarragon or mixed herbs
      4 dr Of hot pepper sauce
      2 c  Crumbs from fresh home-made
           -type white bread
 
  This is what I did with the basic butterflied chicken in the previous
  recipe.  Although there are a lot of instructions in these two
  recipes, they are really not complex and go together pretty quickly
  and easily. The coating is tangy and nicely crunchy.  Pay attention
  to it when broiling though++it can over brown easily.
  
  The chicken is broiled until almost done, then coated with mustard,
  herbs, and fresh bread crumbs for a crisp brown finish.
  
  The chickens.  Follow the preceding recipe, but broil the 2 chickens
  for only 10 rather than 15 minutes on the second (skin) side.
  
  Mustard and herb coating.  Drain the fat and juices out of the
  broiling pan into a small bowl; skim off and discard all but 2
  tablespoons of fat from the top of the juices.  Blend the prepared
  mustard in another bowl with the minced shallot or scallion, herbs,
  and hot pepper sauce. Beat up the remaining juices; blend half of
  them into the mustard. Spread the mustard over the top (skin side) of
  the chicken, then pat on a coating of crumbs. Baste with the
  remaining juices. Ahead-of-time note: May be prepared somewhat ahead
  to this point; set aside at room temperature.
  
  Final cooking and serving.  Roast in the upper third level of a 400F
  oven for 10 to 12 minutes if cooking is delayed).
  
  When is it done?  The chicken is done when the drumsticks are tender
  if pressed, and the crumbs should brown nicely.
  
  Grilling note.  The crumb coating does not work for barbecuing since
  it will fall off and burn when you turn the chicken.  However, you
  can use just the mustard and herb mixture, basted on during the last
  few minutes of cooking (beat a few tablespoons of oil into the
  mustard to take the place of chicken fat).
  
  Makes 8 servings.

MMMMM------------------TAMARIND-RAISIN CHUTNEY-----------------------
 
  Puree all the ingredients in a food processor or blender.  Adjust
  tartness and spiciness to taste.
  
  LEMON-GARLIC BUTTER:
  
  Fry garlic in 1 Tb of butter until lightly browned.  Add rest of
  butter and lemon.  When butter melts, sauce is ready.
  
  ROUGHLY-CHOPPED GARLIC:
  
  Actually, this is not a sauce, but it was such a hit at one squid
  party that I am including it here.
  
  Throw in a handful of chopped garlic 1 minute before the squid rings
  are ready to come out.  Remove golden brown garlic with a mesh scoop
  after you take out the squid.  Be sure you get all the pieces out.
  
  Anything left in the oil will burn and impart a bitter flavor to the
  next batch of squid.
  
  AIOLI MAYONNAISE:
  
  This French garlic mayonnaise recipe is from The Book of Garlic.  It
  makes a great dipping sauce for squid.  You can make it in a blender
  for speed, but it tastes better made the authentic way.
  
  Peel the garlic and pound in a mortar until smooth.  Add the egg
  yolks and seasoning.  Continue pounding until the paste is smooth.
  Then beat in lemon juice with a whisk.  Start adding the oil a drop
  at a time while continuing to whisk.  If you use a blender, whirl the
  garlic, lemon juice and egg yolks for about a minute until smooth and
  then add a slow, thin stream of oil while blender is still on high.
  Do not over liquefy! The sauce should be thick like mayonnaise.  If
  the sauce gets too thick, add water or lemon juice.
  
  Makes about 3 cups.

      Title: Doro Wat (Ethiopian Stew)
 Categories: Ethiopia, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2    To 3 lbs chicken
      9 oz Tomato paste
      3    Sticks butter
     10    Hard boiled eggs slightly
           -scored
      3 lb Onion fine chopped
      2 lg Cloves garlic minced (or 2
           -tsp. powder)
      1 ts Ground black pepper
      3    Heaping tb berbere
 
  Snagged this from over on the Rime Cuisine echo.  I'm in the process
  of making it even as I type and it's *real* good so far.  A sweet,
  rich, hot stew.  The sweetness comes from the huge amount of onions
  used.  The richness from the butter (it definitely ain't health
  food!).  The heat from the "berbere"++a seasoning mix of spices based
  on cayenne peppers. Made in the proportions below it's most
  definitely hot, but nothing someone who can handle jalapenos can't
  handle.  The heat and spiciness could be handled by reducing the
  amount of berbere or even better making the berbere with a lesser
  amount of cayenne so you retain the other spices. The effect is kinda
  off in the general direction of a Mexican Mole. You mop it up with
  Injera, a flat bread++I'm using pita bread and flour tortillas
  instead. Not sure how acceptable that is, but I didn't feel like
  making Injera. Will post a recipe for Injera tomorrow.
  
  If you haven't tasted Ethiopian food, you'll be surprised at the
  unique flavor of Doro Wat.  Even if you have a chance to sample it at
  one of the growing numbers of Ethiopian restaurants in large cities.
  It's a dish worth trying at home.  To eat it the Ethiopian way, pass
  around a tray of injera (flat bread), and place a large platter of
  wat in the center of the table so everyone can reach it.  Tear off
  pieces of injera with your right hand.  Fold the bread around bits of
  stew and eat, without touching you fingers to either the stew or your
  mouth (a trick that requires practice!).
  
  Remove skin from the chicken and score each piece slightly with a
  knife so the sauce can penetrate.
  
  In a large stew pot, melt the butter, then saute the onions and
  garlic for five minutes.  Add berbere, followed by tomato paste,
  stirring occasionally while the mixture simmers about 15 minutes.  A
  piece at a time, stir in the chicken, coating well with the sauce.
  
  Continue to simmer, adding enough water to maintain the consistency
  of a thick soup.  When chicken is half done, after about 20 minutes,
  put in the hard boiled eggs.  Cover and continue cooking until the
  chicken is tender.
  
  The dish is ready when the oil has risen to the top.  Add black
  pepper and let sit until slightly cooled.
  
  Serve with injera.
  
  Makes 8 to 10 servings.

      Title: Down-Home Mashed Potatoes
 Categories: Potatoes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    11-ounce potato per person
      1 tb Butter for each potato
           Milk as needed (1/4 to 1/2
           -cup per potato)
           Salt and white pepper, to
           -taste
           Paprika, for garnish
 
  Mashed potatoes need not be perfectly smooth; in fact, a few small
  lumps improve the texture.  Nor should the milk be premeasured and
  heated: The quantity needed will depend on the type and age of the
  potatoes. (Mealy baking potatoes that have been stored for a long
  time take more milk than new potatoes.) just pour milk in gradually,
  beating after every addi- tion, until the potatoes are just right.  A
  few minutes in the oven before serving will reheat and puff up the
  potatoes .
  
  1.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Meanwhile, peel
  potatoes and quarter or halve them (depending on size).  Drop
  potatoes into the pot as they are peeled, even if water is not quite
  boiling yet. Cook potatoes over high heat until fork tender (about 25
  minutes after water comes to a boil).  Some pieces can be left a
  little underdone. Drain well.
  
  2.  Place potatoes and butter in a large bowl.  Using a potato masher
  or fork, coarsely mash them together.  Make a well in the center and
  pour in a small amount of milk.
  
  3.  With an electric mixer (not a blender or food processor, which
  will turn potatoes into a starchy goo) beat potatoes, adding more
  milk a little at a time as needed, until the desired texture is
  obtained. Tasting carefully, add salt and pepper.  At this point,
  potatoes can be set aside, uncovered, until the rest of dinner is
  nearly ready. one half hour before serving time, preheat oven to 350F.
  
  4.  Mound potatoes in an oven proof casserole, sprinkle with paprika,
  and bake uncovered for 20 minutes.

      Title: Dry-Marinating Ducks
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 tb Coarse (kosher) salt
      1 tb Whole Sichuan peppercorns,
           -roasted and crushed
      2 ts Five-spice powder
 
  Here's the first installment of what has turned into quite a series of
  posts on Chinese Smoke Cooking.  I've still got a few more recipes to
  type in, but this on will getcha started...
  
  This is the Chinese version of "smoking".  It would better be called
  "smoke cooking" as the process is much shorter than Western style
  smoking. This first recipe is fairly complex and lengthy in that it
  will take three days or so for all the steps.  It involves dry
  marinating, steaming and the actual smoking of the duck.  This recipe
  is from Ken Hom's "Chinese Technique" which is profusely illustrated
  with photos. You'll have to use your imagination a bit...
  
  Salt and five-spice powder make a fragrant dry marinade, which draws
  some of the moisture from the duck so that the spices penetrate the
  bird. The marinated duck is then steamed to firm and cook it, then is
  finished by deep- frying or smoking.  Chicken and squab may also be
  prepared this way.
  
  1.  Press down hard on the duck's breastbone to flatten it.
  
  2.  Rub the dry marinade over the trimmed duck.
  
  3.  Rub the dry marinade inside the cavity.
  
  4.  Put the duck on a baking sheet and cover it with another flat
  sheet.
  
  5.  Weight down the top sheet with a pot filled with water to flatten
  the duck and to make it release some of its own moisture.  Let it
  marinate like this, in a cool place or in the refrigerator, for 2
  days. Use the marinated duck to make Smoked Tea Duck, or steam it for
  2 hours to cook and render all the fat.  Let it sit a room
  temperature for several hours to dry then deep-fry in about 4 cups
  oil until crisp.
  
  SMOKED TEA DUCK: This is a cold dish that can be prepared well in
  advance: in fact, we find that ducks smoked 2 days in advance are
  more flavorful. Reduce the steaming time according to the size of the
  bird: allow 15 minutes per pound for chicken, 30 minutes for squab.
  
  The smoking process doesn't actually cook the duck.  It adds flavor
  to a duck already cooked by steaming and changes the texture of the
  flesh to something similar to that of ham.  A covered barbecue grill
  (such as any of the kettle-type barbecues on the market) is perfect.
  
  1 whole duck, 5 to 6 pounds, trimmed, dry marinated for 2 days 6
  slices fresh ginger root, cut into 3-inch sections 6 whole scallions,
  cut into 3-inch pieces
  
  FOR SMOKING: 1 cup raw long-grain rice 1 cup dark Chinese tea leaves
  1/2 cup brown sugar or hickory chips
  
  Serves 4 to 6 as an appetizer
  
  May be smoked up to 2 days ahead of time and refrigerated until ready
  to serve.  Allow to reach room temperature.
  
  Suggested beverage:  Young, full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon or Barolo
  
  1.  Stuff the cavity of the duck with the ginger and scallions.
  
  2.  Steam the duck for 1 hour 15 minutes (for a 5-pound duck) to 1
  hour 30 minutes (for a 6-pound duck) to draw out the fat and to cook
  the duck gently, keeping it moist.  Drain the duck and remove the
  ginger and scallions.
  
  [If you don't have a steamer, you can improvise one by putting an
  upside down bowl or flattish can with both ends removed in a stock
  pot and then putting the duck on a plate on the can.  Fill the pot up
  to just below the plate, cover tightly and steam.  S.C.]
  
  3.  Make a bed of charcoal in the barbecue and ignite it.  When the
  surface turns to ash, set a metal pie plate containing the smoking
  ingredients on the coals.
  
  4.  Cover it with a grate and set the duck on the grate.
  
  5.  Cover the grill an smoke the duck for 45 to 50 minutes, turn ing
  it every 10 to 15 minutes to brown it evenly.  Check the coals
  periodically to make sure they don't die down.
  
  That's it.  I serve this with hot mustard, hoisin sauce and chopped
  green onions for dipping.  And rice of course.

      Title: Duck in Avocado
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Ripe, but firm, avocados
      1 qt Water
           Juice of 1 lemon
           The breast and thigh meat
           -from a whole roasted
           -duckling
      6 md Oranges, peeled and
           -segmented
           Lettuce leaves
    1/4 c  Chopped pecans or toasted
           -sliced almonds
      6 tb Mayonnaise
      2 tb Frozen undiluted orange
           -juice, defrosted
           Parsley sprigs
           Orange wedges (optional)
 
  1.  Peel the avocados, cut them in half, and immediately dip them in
  the water with the lemon juice added to keep them from discoloring.
  
  2.  Be sure the duck meat is skinless and boneless.  Cut it into
  bite-sized pieces.
  
  3.  Mix the duck meat with the orange segments.  Divide into six
  portions. Fill the avocado halves, which have been placed on a
  platter lined with crisp lettuce leaves, with the portions of meat
  and oranges.
  
  4.  Mix the concentrated juice with the mayonnaise and spoon this
  over each stuffed avocado.  Top each with the nuts.  Decorate with
  parsley sprigs and orange wedges.
  
  CHEF'S SECRET:  Always peel the avocado first and then cut it in
  half. This is important, because if avocados are ripe enough to be
  eaten, the halves would be mashed during the peeling process.
  
  If you leave the pits in after halving the avocados and dipping them
  in the lemon water, you can wrap the avocados in plastic wrap and
  keep them all day in the refrigerator.  They won't discolor.
  
  You can give this dish an oriental flavor by mixing 1 tbs. soy sauce
  into the 6 tbs. mayonnaise, replacing the orange with canned
  tangerine segments, and grinding some roasted sesame seeds over the
  dish. (The sesame seeds are available in very bandy little plastic
  throw-away grinders in grocery stores carrying oriental foods.)
  
  When using the canned tangerine segments, you can greatly improve the
  taste by pouring off the canned syrup, rinsing the segments quickly
  in cold water, then transferring them to a plastic container.
  Squeeze the juice of 1 lemon over them and, if you like, add 1 or 2
  tbs. brandy and enough water to cover.  Chill in the refrigerator
  overnight.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 c  Shelled peanuts, red skin
           -removed
    1/2 c  Chestnuts, either fresh or
           -dried
    1/2 c  Ginkgo nuts, canned or fresh

      8    Dried Chinese mushrooms
    1/2 c  Red dates (jujubes)
      1    Duck (about 5 pounds)
           Salt
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh ginger
           -root
      3    Shallots, chopped fine
      2    Eighteen-inch pieces of
           -sugar cane (if
           -unavailable, omit)
           Clear water from 1 coconut
      1 ts Rock sugar
      1 tb Fish sauce
      3    Scallions, both green part
           -and white, cut into 4
           -pieces crosswise
           Sprinkling of freshly
           -ground black pepper
           Sprig fresh coriander
           -(Chinese parsley), chopped
 
  Here are a few recipe for those folks flailing away with huge lengths
  of sugar cane.  They're all Vietnamese.  I've actually made the
  simpler shrimp paste/sugar cane one.  Very yummy.  This first one is
  for duck though...
  
  Prepare the various nuts, the lotus seeds, dried mushrooms, and red
  dates as follows:
  
  Soak the peanuts in hot water for 30 minutes; drain and set aside. If
  using dried chestnuts, boil for 20 minutes, drain, and set aside.  If
  using fresh ginkgo nuts, remove the shell and blanch to remove the
  thin inner skin; set aside.  Soak the Chinese mushrooms in hot water
  for 20 minutes, then drain, remove the stems and cut into quarters;
  set aside.
  
  Boil the dried lotus seeds for 20 minutes; drain and set aside.  Soak
  the red dates in hot water for 30 minutes.  (If they are very dry,
  boil for 10 minutes.) Drain and set aside.
  
  Rinse and clean the duck.  Rub salt over the duck and rinse off; let
  dry for 10 minutes.
  
  Combine the ginger, shallots, and 1 teaspoon salt.  Rub the inside of
  the duck with the mixture.  Combine the peanuts, chestnuts, ginkgo
  nuts, lotus seeds, and 1 teaspoon salt and stuff the duck.  Sew the
  duck closed with heavy white thread, or else use skewers.
  
  Peel the sugar cane and cut into thin lengthwise strips, the same
  length as the duck.  Place 3 pieces of white kitchen string on a flat
  surface, long enough to tie the slices of sugar cane around the duck,
  covering the entire surface.  Bring the string around and tie as you
  would a roast. Turn the duck over and slide the remaining strips
  under the string, covering the entire duck with the sugar cane.
  
  Pour the coconut water into a large pot.  Put the duck into the pot
  and add enough water to completely cover.  Add the rock sugar and 1
  teaspoon of salt.  Bring to a boil and remove the scum continuously
  for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down, cover, and keep at a lively
  bubble for 2 hours. Turn the duck every 30 minutes.
  
  After 2 hours, remove the duck from the pot; untie and discard the
  sugar cane.  To the liquid remaining in the pot add the mushrooms,
  red dates, 1 teaspoon salt, and the fish sauce.  Boil, covered, for
  15 minutes, then remove the duck to the broth, cover, and simmer for
  an additional 15 minutes.  Remove the duck and add the scallion
  pieces to the broth.
  
  To serve, break the duck, with the bones, into 8 pieces.  Put the
  pieces in individual bowls and add broth, some of the various nuts
  that were stuffed into the duck, red dates, and mushrooms.  Sprinkle
  with black pepper and chopped fresh coriander.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: Dulce De Mange (Mango Paste)
 Categories: Caribbean, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Dulces (literally sweets) like this one are common all over Latin
  America. They are firm, sliceable pastes made from, for example,
  quinces or sweet potatoes.  Serving a slice of semi-soft cheese with
  a similarly- sized slice of dulce is a popular dessert and the
  flavours marry exceptionally well.  This mango dulce originated in
  the Caribbean.
  
  Peel remove the flesh and process enough ripe mangoes to provide 2
  cups of mango puree.
  
  Scrape the puree into a saucepan and add 2 cups of white sugar and a
  tablespoon of lime juice.
  
  Cook over a medium heat, stirring all the time until the mixture
  thickens sufficiently so that you can see the bottom of the saucepan
  in the wake of the spoon.
  
  Moisten the inside of a mould++a cake or loaf tin will do++scrape the
  dulce into it and leave to cool.  When it is cold, turn out. It will
  keep very well wrapped in plastic and refrigerated.

      Title: Easy Cheese and Shrimp Gyozas (East/west)
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Medium shrimp (41 to 50 per
           -pound), shelled and
           -deveined
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Finely minced ginger or

           -sherry
      1 ts Cornstarch
      5    Water chestnuts (fresh),
           -finely chopped
      2    Green onions, chopped
  1 1/2 tb Chopped fresh coriander
      2    Chinese sausages, finely
           -chopped
  1 1/4 c  Grated Monterey Jack cheese
           -(about 5 ounces)
      1    Package (12 to 16 ounces)
           -round siu mai wrappers or
           -won ton wrappers

MMMMM----------------------LIME CREAM SAUCE---------------------------
      1 tb Oil
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      1 tb Lime juice
           Salt and white pepper, to
           -taste
           Fresh coriander
 
  I find Chinese recipes that use dairy products highly suspect and
  tend to turn my nose up at them.  Ooopsss.  Guess I *am* a snob.  ;-}
  But I just bought an excellent new cookbook++Asian Appetizers by
  Joyce Jue, a local (SF local, that is) food columnist.  Check this
  one out...  You should be able to get all the ingredients easily,
  including the Chinese sausages.
  
  Cheese and cream are not traditional ingredients in Asian cooking.
  However, I enjoy the subtle flavor of a mild cheese, such as Monterey
  Jack, and the way it works in this gyoza (Japanese-style potsticker)
  recipe. The cheese acts as a velvety binder that melts in your mouth;
  the cream is used to make a lime-scented sauce.
  
  A dozen gyozas makes a nice appetizer serving for four, but it's not
  really practical to make just a dozen at a time.  This recipe makes 4
  dozen, and the rest can be frozen for another use.  The sauce recipe
  is enough for a dozen; if you want to make more, simply multiply the
  sauce ingredients, but bear in mind that you will have to make the
  sauce separately as part of each batch.  Freeze extra uncooked gyozas
  on a baking sheet; when frozen, transfer them to a freezer bag.  Do
  not defrost before browning.
  
  1.  Toss the shrimp with 1 teaspoon of the salt and let them stand
  for 10 minutes.  Rinse thoroughly, drain, and pat dry.  Finely chop
  the shrimp and put them into a mixing bowl.  Add the remaining salt
  and the ginger, wine, cornstarch, water chestnuts, green onions,
  coriander, sausages and cheese: mix thoroughly.
  
  2.  If you are using won ton wrappers, trim the corners to make them
  round. Place 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of a
  wrapper. Moisten the edge of the wrapper with water and fold it in
  half to enclose the filling and form a half circle.  Pinch the edges
  together to seal. Set the gyoza on a baking sheet; cover it with a
  towel.  Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.
  
  3.  To cook and sauce 4 servings, add 1 tablespoon of oil to a 10-
  inch nonstick skillet and set it over medium heat.  Arrange 12 gyozas
  in a single layer n the pan; pan-fry for 1 minute or until lightly
  browned. Turn the gyozas over and brown the other side, about 1
  minute longer. Add the chicken stock; shake the pan to prevent the
  gyozas from sticking. Cover and cook at a low boil for 2 minutes.
  Remove the gyozas to a plate and keep them warm.
  
  4.  Increase the heat to high and add the cream; bring to a boil and
  cook, stirring until thickened, about 45 seconds.  Stir in the lime
  juice; season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  5.  To serve, divide the sauce among 4 plates; arrange 3 gyozas on
  each. Garnish with fresh coriander.

  This is a gorgeous book by a local Asian food columnist.  She covers
  all of east Asia and includes some of the new "East/West" recipes
  that seem to be evolving in California.  The largest number of
  recipes are from Thailand and China but recipes from Indonesia,
  Japan, Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines are also included.  She
  calls these 'appetizers' but most will easily serve as main courses.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Butter
  1 1/2 lb Crab meat

MMMMM---------------------BRANDY CREAM SAUCE--------------------------
      1 c  Butter
  1 1/4 c  Flour
      5 c  Hot milk
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      2 oz Brandy
     16    Eggs
      3 qt Water
      3 c  White vinegar
 
  Authentic?  I sure as heck can't say.  Fattening++you bet!  Good?
  More'n likely.  How could it help but be with a brandy cream sauce
  and crabmeat.
  
  Melt the butter in a saute pan or skillet over low heat.  Add the
  crab meat and cook slowly, stirring very gently, just until hot,
  about 5 to 8 minutes.
  
  To prepare the brandy cream sauce, melt the butter over low heat in a
  sauce pan.  Stir in the flour gradually, cook for about 3 minutes,
  then gradually pour in the milk, continue stirring.  Cook over low
  beat until the sauce thickens, then add the salt, pepper and brandy.
  Continue to cook about 5 minutes or until the sauce is medium thick.
  
  To poach the eggs, bring the water and the vinegar to a boil in a
  large skillet or saute pan.  Keeping the water at a continuous low
  rolling boil, crack the eggs one by one into it.  Cook until the egg
  whites are firm, about 4 minutes.  Lift the poached eggs out of the
  water with a skimmer or slotted spoon, allowing the water to drain
  back into the pan. Place them on a heated platter while you assemble
  the dishes.
  
  Place 3 ounces of crab meat on each of 8 heated plates, then place 2
  poached eggs side by side on the crab meat.  Ladle sauce evenly over

 Categories: Creole, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lg Eggplants, split lengthwise
      2    Jars (10 ounces each)
           -oysters
      3 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 c  Finely diced onion
      2 lg Garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 ts Herbes de Provence
    1/2 ts Creole seafood seasoning
      2 tb Dry white wine
           I cup fresh bread crumbs
      1 tb Minced chives
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan
 
  Creole-style seafood seasoning blends are sold in most markets; you
  can use a mixture of salt and red, white and black peppers.
  Chesapeake- style seasonings, such as Old Bay, are another option.
  
  Bake the eggplant halves in a 400F oven until just tender.  Scrape
  out the pulp, leaving a shell about 1/2 inch thick attached to the
  skin. Discard any big clumps of seeds and chop the pulp coarsely.
  Drain the oysters, reserving the liquor.  Chop oysters into

      Title: Eggs Neptune with Orange Hollandaise
 Categories: Eggs, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 qt Water
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 ts Salt
      8    Fresh eggs
      4 tb (1/2 stick) unsalted
           -butter, softened
  1 1/2 c  Cooked crab meat,  fresh or
           -canned
      4    English muffins
           Paprika (optional)
      4    Thin slices orange, cut In
           -half (optional)

MMMMM------------------ORANGE HOLLANDAISE SAUCE-----------------------
    1/2 lb (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
           -cut into pieces
      4    Egg yolks
      1 tb Orange juice
      1 ts Grated orange zest
    1/2 ts Grated lemon zest
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Dry mustard
    1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  Prepare the Hollandaise sauce, and keep it warm.  Mix the water with
  the vinegar (which will help the egg whites set quickly) and put it
  with the salt in a wide, shallow saucepan.  Bring water to boil, then
  reduce heat to gentle simmer.  One at a time, break each egg into a
  separate small dish or bowl; then, holding the bowl very near the
  surface of the water, gently slip in the egg.  Add more eggs to the
  pan, taking care not to crowd them.
  
  Continue simmering until whites are firmly set and yolks are covered
  with slightly opaque film, about 3 minutes.  Then use a slotted spoon
  carefully to remove each egg to a folded kitchen towel to drain.
  With small kitchen knife, carefully trim any ragged edges from whites.
  
  While the eggs are poaching, melt half the butter in large skillet
  over moderate to low heat, and saute the crab meat until heated
  through.
  
  Split and toast the English muffins and spread their cut sides with
  remaining butter.  Place two muffin halves on each serving plate.
  Top each half with some crab meat and then a poached egg.  Spoon or
  pour enough Hollandaise over each egg to cover it and spread down the
  side of the muffin onto the plate.  If you wish, garnish with a
  dusting of paprika and half an orange slice.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
  
  ORANGE HOLLANDAISE SAUCE:
  
  In a small saucepan, melt butter over low heat until it's all liquid.
  place remaining ingredients in a food processor or blender and
  process until smoothly blended.  With the machine running, pour in
  the melted butter in a slow, steady stream until it is completely
  mixed in and the sauce is thick. transfer sauce to small metal or
  glass bowl, and set it inside a larger bowl or 1)an of hot water to
  keep it warm.
  
  Makes about 1 1/4 cups.

           Fresh ham, about 5 pounds
           -(pork shoulder with bone
           -may be used)
      8    Green onions

      5 c  Hot water

      4    Star anise
      2    Cinnamon sticks or bark
      2 ts Five-spice powder
      1 ts Salt
 
  This is a recipe from Ken Hom, an author of a number of excellent
  Chinese cookbooks.  This is a "red-stewed" dish.  (No reflection on
  Ken's politics...  ) The sauce can be kept as a "master sauce" and
  used over and over again gaining more subtlety and depth the longer
  you keep it going. Either freeze it or refrigerate and boil once a
  week.
  
  Author's note:  "This dish is easy to prepare, and can be made ahead
  of time.  It reheats well and is also very good served cold++prefect
  for a dinner party or large gathering."
  
  Dry the ham thoroughly with paper towels.  Cut the green onions into
  3-inch segments
  
  Choose a heavy casserole pot, large enough to hold the ham
  comfortably. Heat the pot and then add the oil, ginger, garlic and
  green onions, and stir-fry in the pot for 2 minutes.  Push the
  aromatics to the side and brown the ham on each side until it has
  some color, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour off oil.
  
  Add all the braising liquid ingredients to the pot and bring the
  mixture to a boil.  Turn the heat down to a simmer, cover tightly,
  turning the ham from time to time.  When the ham is tender, remove it
  gently with a large spatula.  The meat should be literally falling
  apart. Place it on a serving platter.
  
  Strain the sauce, skim off any surface fat and reduce the liquid
  until it is slightly thick.  Pour this over the ham and serve.
  
  Serves 8 as part of a Chinese meal.

      Title: Fava Bean and Salt Cod Salad
 Categories: Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Ounces salt cod
      2    To 2 1/2 pounds young fava
           -beans, shelled, peeled
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      2 tb Chopped fresh thyme or
           -winter savory
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Salt (optional)
      4    Ripe tomatoes, peeled,
           -seeded and chopped (about
           -1 cup)
 
  Here, fava beans are paired with salt cod in a rich and filling
  salad. To complement the rustic flavors of this dish, serve with
  toasted garlic-rubbed baguette slices and a soft goat cheese.
  
  Soak the salt cod overnight in a large bowl of cold water.  The next
  day, drain the cod, add fresh water and let soak for 2 hours.  Drain,
  add fresh water and let soak 2 hours longer.  The amount of soaking
  time needed to leach the salt from the fish will vary.
  
  Bring 4 cups of water to a shimmering simmer in skillet just large
  enough to hold the fish.  Add the fish and poach until barely cooked
  through (it should flake easily), about 5 minutes.  Do not boil.
  Remove fish and drain well, then flake it.
  
  Cook the favas in 4 cups boiling water until just tender, about 10 to
  15 minutes.  Drain.
  
  Combine the olive oil, thyme or savory, pepper and salt (if desired).
  Toss with the favas.
  
  Arrange equal portions of the dressed beans, flaked fish and chopped
  tomatoes on individual salad plates.

      Title: Fish Sauce (Nuoc Mam)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Fish Sauce Information
 
  Fish sauce is to Vietnamese cooking what salt is to Western and soy
  sauce to Chinese cooking.  It is included in practically all recipes.
  Prepared from fresh anchovies and salt, layered in huge wooden
  barrels, the manufacture of fish sauce is a major industry.  The
  factories are located along the coast to assure the freshness of the
  fish to be processed. Fermentation is started once a year, during the
  fishing season. After about 3 months in the barrel, liquid drips from
  an open spigot, to be poured back into the top of the barrel.  After
  about 6 months the fish sauce is produced.
  
  The first draining is the very best fish sauce, lighter in color and
  perfectly clear.  [Kinda like "Extra Virgin" fish sauce.  S.C.] It is
  relatively expensive and is reserved for table use.  The second and
  third drainings yield a fish sauce of lower quality and lower cost
  for general- purpose cooking.  The two towns most noted for their
  fish sauce are Phu Quoc and Phan Thiet.  Phu Quoc produces the best
  fish sauce, some of which is exported.  On the label, the "nhi"
  signifies the highest quality. When fish sauce manufactured in
  Vietnam is not available, that of Thailand or Hong Kong is quite
  acceptable.  Philippine or Chinese fish sauce will not be
  satisfactory.  For table use and available in all Oriental groceries
  is Squid Brand Fish Sauce, the best one on the market. Whatever
  brand, look for the "Ca Com" on the label, which means that only
  anchovies were used++an indication of the highest quality for table
  use.

 Categories: French, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
MMMMM---------------------FLAVOURED VINEGAR--------------------------

MMMMM----------------FOR EACH 1 LITRE WINE BOTTLE---------------------
      1 l  (1 3/4 pints) plain wine
           -vinegar
      4    Or 5 shallots, peeled and
           -slightly crushed, threaded
           -on fine string or
      4    Cloves garlic, peeled and
           -slightly crushed or
      2 tb Mustard seed or
      1    Long leafy branch tarragon
           -twice the length of the
           -bottle
 
  Flavoured wine vinegar has been an important ingredient in French
  cooking since medieval times when vinegar was essential in order to
  keep meat edible in warm weather.
  
  In the 13th century, street vendors were granted the right to cry
  their wares in the thoroughfares of Paris.  These cries soon became
  famous, and the vinegar sellers even rolled their casks through the
  narrow streets crying 'Garlic and mustard vinegars, herb vinegar...  '
  
  'Vinaigres, bons et biaux.'
  
  They also sold verjus, the sieved juice of unripe grapes which serves
  to sharpen the flavour of many cooked dishes in the same way that
  vinegar does.  It is still used in some country places and provides a
  means of using up green grapes unfit for any other purpose.
  
  All farm kitchens have an earthenware vinegar barrel.  It constitutes
  another of the many country economies.  After the grape harvest, a
  certain quantity of either red or white wine is reserved and poured
  into the barrel over a liquid fungus or mere de vinaigre which turns
  it into vinegar. The quantity drawn off each day is replaced by
  emptying the remains of the wine bottles into the barrel.
  
  When herbs are most pungent, just before flowering, they are cut and
  used to aromatize some of the vinegar drawn off.  It is then bottled
  and used for flavouring.
  
  Owning a vinegar barrel is a privilege of which few English kitchens
  can boast but plain wine vinegar sold in the multiple chemists' shops
  can be used effectively with home-grown herbs to produce fine vinegar
  at much less cost than that prepared commercially.
  
  FLAVOURED VINEGAR:
  
  Collect the number of bottles necessary, with sound corks to fit.
  Wash the bottles in hot soapy water, rinse first in very hot water
  then in cold, drain, dry and heat in a slow oven.  Scald the corks in
  boiling water.
  
  Pour the vinegar into an enamel-lined or stainless steel pan and over
  a low temperature bring slowly to blood heat.  It should be quite
  warm to the touch of a knuckle joint, no more.  Add shallots, garlic,
  mustard seed or tarragon to the warm bottles.  (If using tarragon,
  this should be bent double and pushed down the neck of the bottle.)
  Fill up with warm vinegar, cork down tightly, and place on a sunny
  window sill to mature for 6 weeks before use.

      Title: Fog City Diner's Tomato Ketchup
 Categories: Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 lb Ripe plum tomatoes, coarsely
           -chopped
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Cider vinegar
      1 tb Minced garlic
    3/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Mixed pickling spice
      1 sm Stick cinnamon, about 1/4
           -inch long
  1 1/2 ts Dry mustard
    1/2 ts (scant) freshly ground
           -pepper
      2 tb Cornstarch dissolved in
    1/4 c  Cold water
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  The Fog City Diner was one of the places that came along with the
  diner revival of a few years back.  It is, or was, a trendy place
  over in the City.  I think it may have closed after the '89 quake,
  but I'm not sure about that.
  
  Combine the tomatoes, sugar, vinegar, garlic, salt, pickling spice,
  cinnamon, dry mustard and pepper in a large, heavy stainless steel or
  enameled saucepan.  Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat,
  stirring occasionally.  Reduce the heat and simmer the ketchup,
  uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring frequently.  Remove the ketchup
  from the heat and let it cool a few minutes.
  
  Force the ketchup through a fine sieve to strain it, pressing down
  hard on the solids.  Rinse out the saucepan and return the ketchup to
  a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat and
  simmer the ketchup, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes.  (Even if
  the ketchup seems thin, do not cook it any longer, as the thickening
  power of the cornstarch lessens with prolonged cooking.  The ketchup
  will thicken a bit more upon cooling.) Remove the ketchup from the
  heat and let it cool to room temperature. Store the tomato ketchup,
  covered, in the refrigerator for up to a month.
  
  Makes about 5 cups.

      Title: French Onion Soup
 Categories: Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 tb Butter
      1 tb Light olive oil or fresh
           -peanut oil
      8 c  Thinly sliced onions (2 1/2
           -pounds)
    1/2 ts Each salt and sugar (sugar
           -helps the onions to brown)
      2 tb Flour
  2 1/2 qt Homemade beef stock, (see
           -following recipe for
           -stock), at
           Least 2 cups of which
           -should be hot
      4    To 5 tablespoons Cognac,
           -Armagnac, or other good
           -brandy
      1 c  Dry white French vermouth
 
  The following three recipes are from the book by Julia Child that I
  was raving about the other day.  They actually produce two dishes;
  the basic butterflied chicken recipe can stand alone or be used as
  the starting point for all sorts of variations++the Mustard Coated
  Chicken is just one of the possible take-offs using it.  It's nicely
  hoity-toity in appearance and tastes great.
  
  This is certainly one of the all-time favorites.  The canned and
  packaged onion soups I've tried have been very good, and the only way
  to better them is for you to have your own beautiful beef stock.
  However, bought onion soup will benefit from the flavor additions
  suggested here. TIMING: For most delicious results, you want a slow
  simmer for 2 3/4 to 3 hours.
  
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:
  
  A food processor with slicing blade or a hand slicer is useful for the
  onions; a heavy-bottomed 3-quart saucepan with cover for onion
  cooking and simmering.
  
  Browning the onions - 40 minutes.  Set the saucepan over moderate
  heat with the butter and oil; when the butter has melted, stir in the
  onions, cover the pan, and cook slowly until tender and translucent,
  about 10 minutes. Blend in the salt and sugar, raise heat to
  moderately high, and let the onions brown, stirring frequently until
  they are dark walnut color, 25 to 30 minutes.
  
  Simmering the soup.  Sprinkle in the flour and cook slowly, stirring,
  for another 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from heat, let cool a moment,
  then whisk in 2 cups of hot stock.  When well blended, bring to the
  simmer, adding the rest of the stock, the Cognac or brandy, and the
  vermouth. Cover loosely, and simmer very slowly 1 1/2 hours, adding a
  little water if the liquid reduces too much.  Correct seasoning.
  
  Ahead-of-time note:  May be prepared in advance; chill uncovered, then
  cover and refrigerate or freeze.
  
  Serving.  Serve the soup as it is, accompanying it with French bread
  and a bowl of grated Swiss or Parmesan cheese, or gratine it as
  follows. Makes about 2 1/2 quarts, serving 6.
  
  VARIATION:
  
  ONION SOUP GRATINEED:  When onion soup is a main course, bake it in
  the oven with cheese and toasted French bread, and bring it all
  crusty and bubbling to the table.  A big salad, more bread and
  cheese, and fruit could finish the meal,; accompanied by a bottle or
  two of fruity white wine, like a sauvignon blanc or even a
  gewurztraminer.
  
  MANUFACTURING NOTE:  Be sure you have a homemade type of bread with
  body here because flimsy loaves will disintegrate into a slimy mass;
  a recipe for your own homemade French bread also follows.
  
  12 or more Hard-Toasted French Bread Rounds (follows, too) [I left it
  out. S.C.] 1 to 2 ounces Swiss cheese, very thinly sliced Ingredients
  for the preceding French Onion Soup, heated 3/4 to 1 cup finely
  grated Swiss or Parmesan cheese
  
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:  A lightly buttered 3-quart ovenproof
  casserole or baking dish about 3 inches deep - good-looking if
  possible. Assembling and baking - about 30 minutes.  Preheat the oven
  to 425F and set the rack in the lower middle level.  Line the bottom
  of the casserole with half the slices of toasted French bread, and
  spread over them the sliced cheese.  Ladle on the hot onion soup and
  float over them a layer of toasted bread, topping with the grated
  cheese.  At once set in the preheated oven and bake for 20 to 30
  minutes, until the cheese has melted and browned nicely.  Serve as
  soon as possible, if you dally too long, the toast topping may sink
  into the soup.

      Title: Fresh Lotus Root Salad
 Categories: Chinese, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh lotus root
    1/2 ts Grated fresh ginger
      4 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb White vinegar
    1/2 tb Asian sesame oil
      1 tb Chopped fresh coriander
           Toasted black or white
           -sesame seeds for garnish
 
  If you haven't tried fresh lotus roots do yourselves a favor and pick
  up some from an Oriental market.  They look like nothing so much as
  strings of vegetable sausages a few inches long and about three
  inches in diameter. The flavor is somewhat reminiscent of a water
  chestnut as is the texture++very fresh, crisp and good.  When sliced,
  they have an intriguing, lacy cross section that comes from air
  channels in the root. Lotus root is also available canned and it's
  not bad++not as good as fresh, but quite acceptable.  They can better
  than water chestnuts and retain more of the characteristics of the
  fresh root than do water chestnuts. Lotus roots make a nice addition
  to soups too.
  
  BTW, it's considered bad form by Asian grocers to break up the hands
  of roots.  They're not that expensive and you'll probably use all you
  buy anyway.
  
  Rinse lotus roots with cold water.  Trim and discard both ends of the
  bulb. With a vegetable peeler, pool the skin.  Diagonally cut thee
  root into 1/8 inch thick slices; immediately plunge slices into
  acidulated water. Drain.
  
  Put lotus roots into a heat-proof bowl.  Pour enough boiling water to
  cover; let sit for 5 minutes.  Drain.  Rinse with cold water.  Pat
  dry. refrigerate until chilled.
  
  For the dressing; in bowl, combine thoroughly the ginger, sugar soy
  sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and coriander.  Put lotus root slices into
  a shallow bowl; pour dressing over lotus roots.  Arrange on
  individual salad plates, garnish with sesame seeds.  Serve chilled.
  
  Serves 8.

      Title: Fricassee De Poulet a la Poitevine (Chicken in Onion Sauc
 Categories: French, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 kg (2 lb) onions
      1    Chicken (1.5-2 kg [3-4 lb])
           Salt, black pepper
     25 g  (1 oz) butter
      2 tb Flour
 
  The regional recipes of France have evolved throughout time to
  complement the local wines.  Hence the rich recipes of Burgundy,
  Poitou and Vendee produce wines of lesser glory and their recipes, in
  consequence, are more homely-but none the less appetizing when served
  with the 'little' wines of the region.
  
  Peel the onions, quarter them and slice thickly.
  
  Wipe the chicken inside and out with a cloth wrung out in boiling
  water. Cut into 10 serving pieces:  2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings
  and 2 breasts halved.  Season each piece on both sides.  Melt the
  butter in a sauteuse or large frying pan over low heat and when
  foaming add the chicken and colour to the golden stage on both sides.
  Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon, cover and keep hot.  Add
  the onions to the fats in the pan, season, increase the heat to
  medium, mix well and colour to the golden stage, moving them around
  with a wooden spatula to prevent sticking and colouring too fast.
  
  Sprinkle with half the flour and mix in thoroughly before adding the
  remainder.  Cook for a few moments, stirring constantly, reduce the
  heat to low, add the vinegar, stir well and arrange the chicken on
  top.  Cover and cook slowly for about 40 minutes until the chicken is
  tender and the moisture from the onions has made the sauce.  During
  this time shake the pan frequently and do not lift the lid except to
  stir the ingredients twice.  Correct the seasoning if necessary and
  serve very hot with plain boiled potatoes.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

  Put a cup of flour seasoned with salt and pepper in a large, brown
  grocery bag.  Then put the chicken pieces in a few at a time and
  shake vigorously to coat them well.  Fry 'em uncovered in about a
  quarter inch oil for 45 minutes or so.  Drain the excess oil, leaving
  about three tablespoons and brown an equal amount of flour in the
  oil, then gradually whisk in a cup or so of milk.  Viola!  Fried
  Chicken and Pan Gravy.  This was how my grandmother made fried
  chicken and it was indisputably the BEST in the world!  I do it
  exactly as she did, but still can't get it that good... This should
  make a nice, crispy batch of chicken.  If you cover while frying, it
  will probably come out soggy.

      2 tb Minced pared fresh ginger
           -root
      2 tb Minced fresh parsley
      1 sm Egg white
      4 tb Cornstarch
      4 c  Vegetable oil
 
  This one is kinda unusual as it calls for frying up joined legs and
  thighs then cutting them into one inch bone-in slices after cooking.
  This is usually done with whole birds and I don't see why you
  couldn't use a whole chicken in this recipe.  You'll need a Chinese
  cleaver or a hefty chef's knife for the chopping.
  
  Three of the contributing chefs who created original recipes for the
  book are Japanese.  I understand that Chinese food is the favorite
  'gaijin' cuisine in Japan and Chinese places abound.  Just an
  interesting tidbit...
  
  1.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper; rub to coat evenly. Place
  chicken in non aluminum baking pan.  Pound 2 onions and the sliced
  ginger root lightly with flat side of cleaver; chop coarsely and
  scatter over chicken.  Sprinkle chicken with rice wine.  Marinate at
  room temperature, turning chicken once, for 30 minutes.
  
  2.  Arrange lettuce on large serving platter.  Refrigerate covered.
  
  3.  Mix sugar, vinegar, stock, soy sauce and sesame oil in small
  saucepan. Stir in minced onion, ginger and parsley.
  
  4.  Whisk egg white in small bowl until foamy and double in volume.
  Whisk in 2 tablespoons cornstarch.  Reserve batter.
  
  5.  Heat wok over high heat for 20 seconds; add vegetable oil and
  heat to 350F.
  
  6.  Meanwhile, drain chicken; discard marinade.  Pat chicken dry with
  paper toweling; dust with 2 tablespoons cornstarch.  Spread batter on
  areas of chicken not covered with skin, coating evenly.
  
  7.  Fry 2 chicken pieces at a time, turning once, until crispy and
  cooked through, 7 to 9 minutes.  (To test for doneness, pierce
  thickest part of drumstick to the bone with tip of knife; juices
  should run clear.) Drain chicken on paper toweling, keep warm in a
  200F oven. Repeat, frying remaining 2 chicken pieces.
  
  8.  Heat stock mixture over medium heat to simmering.  Reduce heat to
  low; simmer for 1 minute.  Keep dressing hot.
  
  9.  Cut warm chicken into 1/2-inch wide slices; use a meat mallet or
  hammer to pound cleaver or sturdy chef's knife through bones.
  Reassemble chicken slices and place on bed of lettuce.  Pour hot
  dressing over chicken. Serve immediately.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
      1 tb Chopped lemon grass
      2 tb Chopped shallots
      1 tb Chopped garlic
      1 tb Yellow curry powder
 
  Mix together the corn, egg, curry paste, rice flour, soy sauce and 1
  teaspoon salt.  Shape the mixture with your hands to form circular
  cakes about 1 inch in diameter.
  
  Dip the cakes in the wheat flour and then fry immediately in the very
  hot oil.  (Do not fry more than 6 to 8 cakes at a time or they will
  not cook properly.)
  
  To make the sauce, bring to a boil the vinegar, water sugar, salt and
  chili.  Let it cool.
  
  Pound the peanuts and add to the cooled mixture.  Lastly, add the
  cucumber.
  
  From "Discover Thai Cooking".  Pierre Chaslin, Piyatep Canungmai, Luca

  NOTE:  These little guys are tasty!  Scoop up some of the sauce on
  each one and wolf 'em down.  I've used plain curry powder instead of
  the yellow curry paste with good results, but here's the recipe for
  the paste if you want to go to the effort:
  
  Place the cumin and coriander seeds in a pan without adding any oil.
  Dry fry them, stirring, over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes until
  they are slightly browned, and give off a roasted aroma.
  
  Coarsely chop the chilies and soak in water for 10 minutes.  Drain.
  Pound all the ingredients together to produce a fine paste which goes
  well with beef and pork.
  
  From the same book.  You can work out your frustrations pounding the
  spice mix in a mortar and pestle or you can use a food processor if
  you're feeling particularly harmonious...  Make a lot of the paste
  and save it for use in other curries.

  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes a
  recipe for Fried Shrimp Rolls!!!  These triangular little goodies are
  great when served alongside Cha Gio.  These are *really* good!
  Prepare the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.
  
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with
  only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a
  barely damp cloth to prevent curling.
  
  Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water.  Remove and spread
  flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it
  out without touching the other round.  The rice papers will become
  pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Place 1 shrimp in
  the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.
  Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press
  into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it
  is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely
  and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold
  the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle.  The completed
  roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers
  in the same manner.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will
  stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning
  often until crisp and golden brown.  Drain the rolls on paper towels.
  Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and
  coriander leaves.
  
  NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F
  oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.
  
  Yield: 24 shrimp rolls.

           Vegetable Platter

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      6    Dried Chinese mushrooms
      1 tb Dried tree ear mushrooms
      6    Water chestnuts or 1/2
           -small jicama, peeled and
           -chopped

           -sauce)
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      3    Eggs

MMMMM-------------------ASSEMBLING AND FRYING------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
     80 sm Rounds of rice paper (banh
           -trang), each 6 1/2 inches
           -in diameter
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  This is another version of the superlative Cha Gio (also called
  Nems). The filling here is a bit more elaborate than in the first
  one. Boil the noodles.  Prepare the Nuoc Cham and Vegetable Platter.
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the two types of mushrooms in hot water
  until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain.  Remove the stems from the
  mushrooms and squeeze to extract the liquid.  Mince the mushrooms.
  Combine the mushrooms with the remaining filling ingredients in a
  large bowl. Mix with your hands to blend.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  The rice paper sheets are brittle and must
  be handled with care.  (The water is used to soften the sheets for
  handling. Sweetening the water helps the rice paper turn a deep
  golden color when fried and also produces crisper rolls.) Work with
  only 4 sheets of rice paper at a time, keeping the remaining sheets
  covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling. One at a time,
  immerse a sheet in the warm water. Quickly remove it and spread flat
  on a dry towel. Do not let the sheets touch each other.  The rice
  paper will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press into a
  compact rectangle. Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side. Roll from bottom to top to completely enclose the
  filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in
  batches, add some of the rolls to each skillet, but do not crowd or
  let them touch, or they will stick together.  Fry over moderate heat
  for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp.  Remove
  the rolls with tongs and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in a low
  oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Traditionally, Cha Gio is served with the accompaniments suggested in
  this recipe.
  
  To eat, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with a few
  strands of noodles and a variety of other ingredients from the
  Vegetable Platter before dipping it in the Nuoc Cham.  If served as
  an hors d'ouvre, allow 4 or 5 rolls per person; serve 8 to 10 as a
  main course.
  
  NOTE:  Another popular way of serving this dish is to divide the
  noodles and elements of the Vegetable Platter evenly among the
  individual bowls. Top each with cut-up pieces of Cha Gio, ground
  roasted peanuts and Nuoc Cham.
  
  As a quick and easy appetizer, Cha Gio can be served with just Nuoc
  Cham.
  
  Yield: about 80 spring rolls.

           Peanut oil for frying
 
  The book notes that true Buddhist vegetarians would not use garlic or
  fish sauce and would limit the dips to plain soy or plum sauce.
  Unless you are in this category, Peanut Sauce (Nuoc Leo) and Nuoc
  Cham are great dips as well.
  
  Prepare the Vegetable Platter, noodles and dipping sauce.  Set aside.
  
  Soak the noodles in warm water and the mushrooms in hot water for 30
  minutes; drain.  Cut the noodles into 1/2-inch lengths.  Remove and
  discard the stems from the mushrooms; squeeze to extract most of the
  soaking liquid.  Mince all of the mushrooms.
  
  Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl; blend
  well with your hands.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a large bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.
  
  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with only 4 sheets at a time,
  keeping the remaining sheets covered with a barely damp cloth to
  prevent curling.
  
  Immerse the rice paper, one sheet at a time, into the sweetened warm
  water. Quickly withdraw it and lay it flat on a dry towel.  Do this
  with 4 sheets without letting them touch each other.  The rice paper
  will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold over the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press it into a
  compact rectangle.  Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side.  Roll from the bottom to the top to completely
  enclose the filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.  (The
  rolls can be prepared 1 day in advance.  Wrap and refrigerate.)
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible use 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2 inches
  of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in batches, add
  some of the rolls without letting them touch, or they will stick
  together. Fry for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and
  crisp.  Remove the rolls from the oil with tongs and drain on paper
  towels.  Keep warm in a low oven until all of th rolls are cooked.
  
  To serve, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with some
  noodles and selected items from the Vegetable Platter and dips the
  package in the dipping sauce.
  
  NOTE:  The fried rolls can be frozen, then thawed and reheated in a
  350F oven just to crisp and heat through.
  
  Yield: 40 rolls.

      Title: Fried Won Tons
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Won ton skins
    1/2 lb Fresh ground pork
    1/2 lb Fresh prawns
      4    Dried mushrooms, soaked for
           -2 hours
      8    Water chestnuts, finely
           -chopped
      2    Stalks green onions, finely
           -chopped
      2 sm Eggs, beaten
    1/4 ts Pepper
  1 1/2 ts Salt
 
  Here are three won ton related recipes++fried won tons, won ton soup
  and a dip for the fried won tons.  I have recipes for won ton dough
  too, if you want them.  Personally, I find the won ton skins
  available in markets to be just fine and a lot less work!
  
  Yield: About 60 to 70.
  
  Shell and devein prawns.  Mince fine.  Stem mushrooms and mince caps.
  Mix with prawns, pork, water chestnuts, green onions, half of the
  beaten eggs and all of the seasonings.
  
  WRAPPING:
  
  Place won ton squares on working surface so corners face up, down,
  left and right.  Place 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each skin.
  
  Dip a little of the beaten egg onto the bottom corner, bring top
  corner to meet bottom corner.  Press to seal.  Moisten left corner
  and bring right corner to meet it.  Press to seal.  [This should give
  you a little bundle that looks kinda like a nurses hat.  S.C.]
  
  FRYING:
  
  Heat 4 cups oil in wok.  Fry wrapped won ton until golden (about 2
  minutes).  Turn over once.  Drain and serve hot.
  
  DO-AHEAD NOTES:
  
  Deep fry won ton, cool and freeze.  To reheat, preheat oven to 350F.
  
  Place frozen won ton onto cookie sheets and heat for 12 to 15 minutes.
  
  COMMENTS:
  
  You may substitute ground turkey for meat in won ton filling.
  
  However since turkey is drier and more bland than pork, add a few more
  water chestnuts and 1/4 tsp. monosodium glutamate to enhance flavor
  and texture.

      Title: Frijoles (South American Beans)
 Categories: Colombia, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Got another care package from Down Under, courtesy Mark Herron.  The
  following series of recipes are from the Raw Materials column by Meryl
  Constance who writes for the Sydney Morning Herald.  The three
  columns this time covered basil, veal and strawberries (remember
  them?  ;-}). Pay attention now++there's some good-looking stuff
  here...
  
  This recipe comes from Antioquia in Colombia but variations on the
  theme are made all over South and Central America.  In Colombia, it
  is served with rice and a number of side dishes, including crisp pork
  crackling, bananas, avocados and white corncakes.  Stretched in this
  way, the quantities given here would easily serve eight.
  
  Into a large pot 2 cups of red kidney beans (not pre-soaked).  Add 5
  cups of a mixture made from the liquid drained from a large tin of
  peeled tomatoes (the tomatoes themselves are used later) and your
  choice of stock.
  
  Do not add salt it is said to prevent the beans softening properly.
  Cover the pot and put the beans to cook over a low heat.  South
  American practice is to add a tablespoon of oil when the beans begin
  to wrinkle but Raw Materials omits this with no ill-effects.
  Continue cooking until tender++about 2 to 3 hours.
  
  Meanwhile, finely chop 2 large onions and 4 cloves of garlic and fry
  gently in a little oil.  Add 500 g minced meat (usually beef but take
  your choice) and fry very slowly until brown.  Add the tinned
  tomatoes, a chopped green capsicum, 2 or 3 bay leaves, 2 teaspoons
  cumin, half a bunch of basil (chopped), 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper,
  pepper and salt.
  
  Tip the contents of the frying pan into the beans and simmer slowly
  till well blended.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

      4    Onions
      1 lg Leek

     10    Black peppercorns
      4    Cloves
           Black pepper (optional)
      2 tb Finely chopped parsley
 
  Here's a French version from a great cookbook about French farm
  cooking, The French Farmhouse Kitchen.  The book is clear, concise
  and presents recipes that are generally simple but not lacking in
  character.
  
  I like it because it presents the cultural background to support the
  recipes and gives a feel of the values and day to day lives of the
  folks who cook them.
  
  Have the butcher split the head into halves and remove the ears.
  
  Place cut side down in a sieve and pour fast-boiling water over the
  skin. Drain and scrape off any blemishes.  Peel and finely chop the
  shallots.
  
  Peel the carrots and onions and trim the leek, cut them all into
  pieces.
  
  Place the pig's head, carrots, onions, leek and peeled garlic in a
  large pan, cover generously with cold water and bring slowly to
  boiling point over low heat.  Skim off the froth that rises and when
  clear add the herbs tied together, seasoning and cloves.  Cover and
  cook, simmering steadily, for 2 hours or until the meat detaches
  itself from the bones.
  
  Remove the meat, skin and fat from the bones, Cut into pieces and
  place in a large bowl.  Add the brains, and the tongue skinned and
  cut into small pieces.  Mash with a fork and mix well.  Test for
  seasoning, add black pepper if necessary so that the mixture is well
  flavoured.  Mix in the chopped shallot and parsley, and stir to
  incorporate thoroughly.
  
  Pour into 2 wetted moulds and when cold refrigerate until required.
  
  To serve, cut into slices and arrange on a large serving dish
  surrounded by lettuce leaves.  Hand French mustard separately and a
  mixed green salad tossed in vinaigrette dressing.
  
  Being made of fresh meat this brawn should be eaten within a week.
  
  Makes 8 to 10 servings.

      Title: Fruit with an Added Punch
 Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  More from Mark in Sydney...  We're eating preserved fruits here in the
  States now, but here are some tips for putting them up for next
  winter. These tips center around using alcohol to preserve fruits of
  various types. Like brandied peaches?  Then pay attention here... If
  you have an abundance of fresh fruit, try preserving some in alcohol
  for a very special treat, suggests Jill Chinner.
  
  Fruits suitable for bottling In alcohol are peaches, apricots, pears,
  cherries, figs, dried fruits, grapes and Kiwi fruit. First, make a
  syrup as you would for preserving.  Choose from light, medium or
  heavy, depending on your sweetness of tooth.  You can use white,
  brown or raw sugar or substitute honey according to taste.
  
  Light syrup: one cup sugar to three cups water. Medium syrup: one cup
  sugar to two cups water. Heavy syrup: one cup sugar to one cup water.
  
  Dissolve sugar in water and simmer gently for five minutes; allow to
  cool.
  
  To make a liqueur syrup, use equal quantities of your choice of
  liqueur or spirits and sugar syrup (see suggested combinations below).
  
  Next, prepare your fruit, again as you would for preserving. Peaches:
  peel, stone and cut in sections.
  
  Apricots: stone and cut in halves. Grapes: wash and remove stems. Kiwi
  fruit: peel and cut lengthways. Cherries: remove stones and stems.
  Pears: peel, core and cut in quarters.
  
  To each two litres of light or medium syrup, add five grams of citric
  acid. Figs:  wash and remove stems.  To each one litre of light or
  medium syrup add five grams of citric acid.
  
  Dried fruits:  Cover with cold water and stand overnight.  Cook
  gently, uncovered, until plumped.  Drain.  Reserve liquid to make a
  light syrup. Then, place fruit in clean preserving jars.  Pour over
  sugar/liqueur (or just sugar) syrup, seal and place in preserver.
  See preserver instruction book for cooking times.
  
  Suggested combinations:
  
  Peaches: with brandy, Marsala, rum or vodka. Apricots: with brandy,
  Cointreau, Grand Marnier, rum or vodka. Grapes: Green ginger wine,
  white wine or port (for black grapes only). Kiwi fruit: creme de
  menthe. Pears: creme de menthe or brandy. Figs: port or brandy.
  Cherries: kirsch or brandy. Dried fruits: brandy or rum. Or use your
  imagination to make up other combinations.

      Title: Gai Tom Kha (Thai Chicken and Coconut Milk Soup)
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Medium coconut milk
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      3 qt Pieces dried galangal
           -(kha), or
      6 qt Pieces fresh galangal
      4    Stalks fresh lemon grass,
           -bruised, cut into 2-inch
           -lengths
      6    Fresh Serrano chiles,
           -sliced into rounds
      1 lg Whole chicken breast *
      4 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)
      5    Fresh Kaffir lime leaves
           -(makrut), if available
      2    Fresh limes, juice
      2 tb Chopped coriander leaves
 
  *  cut into 1/2-inch pieces (with or without bones, see note)
  
  Combine coconut milk, chicken stock, galangal, lemon grass and 4 of
  the chiles in a saucepan; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
  for 20 minutes.  Strain stock; discard galangal and lemon grass.
  Return stock to a boil, add chicken and simmer until tender, about 2
  minutes.  Add fish sauce, citrus leaves and remaining chiles.  Stir
  in the lime juice. Garnish with coriander.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.
  
  NOTE:  I like to use boned chicken breast if I'm cooking for guests.
  For the best flavor, however, use a whole small chicken chopped into
  small pieces with the bones; increase the cooking time until chicken
  is tender.

      Title: Garlic and Ginger Chicken Baked in a Clay Pot
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 lb Frying chicken
      2 lg Garlic cloves, minced
      1    Knob fresh ginger, grated
           Salt and pepper, to taste
      2 ts Asian sesame oil
 
  I highly recommend the romertopf type clay pots.  Especially for
  chicken. I've done several chicken recipes in mine and they all came
  out extremely savory and done to perfection.  There's a unique, rich
  flavor that seems to typify food cooked in this way.  Haven't tried
  this one yet, but it's high on the list.  The ingredients are Asian,
  the technique Western. The result, I imagine, is delectable.  It's a
  very simple recipe. At least the first time I'd resist any temptation
  to embellish it. Well, maybe a few fermented black beans...  ;-}
  
  Rinse the chicken inside and out and pat dry.  Work your fingers
  under the skin of the chicken, carefully loosening skin from flesh
  across the breast and legs.
  
  Mix together the garlic, ginger, salt and pepper; rub evenly under the
  skin.
  
  Brush the chicken with sesame oil.
  
  Soak a 2-quart unglazed clay cooking pot in cold water to cover for 10
  minutes.  Drain and place the chicken breast-up in the pot.  Cover and
  place in a cold oven; turn the thermostat to 475F and roast for 1
  hour.
  
  Remove pot from oven and place on a towel.  Put lid on another towel.
  (The hot clay will break if placed on a cold surface).  Transfer
  chicken to a heated serving platter and drizzle with some of the
  juices left in the pot.
  
  Serves 4.

      Yield: 1 chicken
 
      1 lb (450g) chicken, cut into 1"
           -x 2" x 1/4" (2.5 cm x 5cm
           -x 0.75 cm)
           Pieces
      3    Cloves garlic, finely
           -chopped
      1 tb (15 ml) wine
      1 tb (15 ml) soy sauce
      2 ts (10 ml) garlic salt
    1/4 ts (1 ml) sugar
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
      3 tb (45 ml) flour
        ds Of five-spice powder
           -(optional)
      4 c  (1 L) oil
 
  I looked all through my Chinese books and the only one with a recipe
  for Garlic Chicken was one by Martin Yan.  I've never made this
  recipe although I did have Garlic Chicken once in a restaurant and it
  was excellent. Here's the recipe in Martin's own inimitable words...
  It was once said in New York, "The only thing 50 cents will get you
  these days is a seat on the subway." Garlic will get you a seat in no
  time! Here's a power-packed dish that will remind you of your Italian
  mother's cooking.
  
  1.  Combine Chicken with garlic, wine, soy sauce, garlic salt and
  sugar; marinate for 2 hours. 2. Add beaten eggs and flour to chicken
  and mix well. 3.  Heat oil in wok near smoke point.  Reduce heat to
  medium.  Deep- fry chicken for 2 to 3 minutes or until tender.
  
  NOTE: It doesn't say in the book, but the Garlic Chicken I had was
  bone-in.

      Title: General Tso's Chicken (Marius Kirschner)
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      4    Chicken legs, skinned & cut
           -into six pieces each
      2    Egg whites
      2 ts Cornstarch
      1    TB rice vinegar
      1    TB light soy sauce
      1    TB rice wine
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Cornstarch, mixed with 1
           -tsp water
    1/2 c  Peanut oil
      3    Dried red chili peppers
      1    Scallion, chopped (separate
           -white & green parts)
      1 sm Knob fresh ginger, minced
      1    Garlic clove, minced
      2 ts Sesame oil
 
  Here's a couple of recipes for Gen. Tso's Chicken and a hint on how
  to get pro results.  Can't vouch for them as I've never made the
  dish. These are reposts from other folks.
  
  Vigorously blend egg whites and cornstarch; add chicken pieces and
  toss to coat.  Heat oil in large wok and add chicken pieces in
  batches, cooking each until golden, about 3 minutes, then draining.
  
  Pour off all but 1 TB of hot oil from wok.  Add peppers and stir-fry
  for 15 seconds; add green scallion, minced ginger and garlic and
  stir-fry for 15 more seconds.  Add mixture of vinegar, soy, wine, and
  sugar, stirring until heated through.  Add cornstarch and water
  mixture and stir until mixture is thickened.  Off heat, stir in
  sesame oil, garnish with scallion greens, and serve.
  
  NOTE FROM ALAN CLAVER:
  
  Just made my bi-monthly batch of General Tso's Chicken.  I've been
  trying for many months to get it to come out just like in my favorite
  Chinese restaurant but couldn't.  Well, I recently read about the
  double frying method of cooking and thought I'd try it - Yippee!
  that's what we missing.
  
  What you do is deep fry the chicken pieces once, then put them aside
  for a bit and reheat the oil.  Then, fry them a second time.  This
  really gives them extra crispiness and flavor.  You couldn't tell
  this batch from a professional version (umm.. modesty aside 8-)).

 Categories: African, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Salt cod
      3 md Boiling potatoes (about 1
           -pound)
      4 md Firm ripe tomatoes
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      3 sm Onions, peeled and cut
           -crosswise into slices 1/8
           -inch thick
      1 tb Plus 1 teaspoon finely
           -chopped fresh hot chilies
      1 ts Finely chopped garlic
      1 tb Light-brown sugar
      1    Lemon, cut lengthwise into
           -4 or 6 wedges
           Parsley sprigs
 
  Starting a day ahead, place the cod in a glass, enameled or
  stainless-steel pan or bowl.  Cover it with cold water and soak for
  at least 12 hours, gently squeezing the cod dry and changing the
  water every 3 or 4 hours.
  
  Drain the cod, rinse it thoroughly under cold running water, and cut
  it into 1-inch pieces.
  
  Drop the potatoes into enough lightly salted boiling water to cover
  them completely and cook briskly, uncovered, until they are almost
  tender and show only slight resistance when pierced with the point of
  a sharp knife. Drain and peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch
  cubes.
  
  Place the tomatoes in a pan of boiling water and let them boil
  briskly for about 10 seconds.  Run cold water over them, and peel
  them with a small, sharp knife.  Cut the tomatoes crosswise into
  1/8-inch- thick rounds.
  
  In a heavy 10 to 12-inch skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat
  until a light haze forms above it.  Drop in the onions and, stirring
  frequently, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are soft and
  golden brown. Watch carefully for any sign of burning and regulate
  the heat accordingly. Add the tomatoes, 1 tablespoon of the chilies,
  the garlic and sugar, and cook briskly, uncovered, stirring from time
  to time, until most of the liquid in the pan has evaporated and the
  mixture is thick enough to hold its shape lightly in a spoon.
  
  Stir in the cod and potatoes, reduce the heat to low, and cover
  tightly. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily
  when prodded gently with a fork.  Taste for seasoning.
  
  Serve the gesmoorde vis at once, mounded on a heated platter or in a
  large bowl.  Sprinkle with the remaining teaspoon of chopped chilies
  and arrange the lemon wedges and parsley sprigs decoratively on top.
  Serve accompanied, if you like, by hot boiled rice and lemon or green
  bean atjar.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

      Title: Glutinous Rice with Ham and Dried Shrimp
 Categories: Chinese, Rice, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 c  Glutinous rice, washed and
           -soaked 2 hours, then
           -drained
      3 c  Water
    1/2 c  Slivered ham
    1/4 c  Dried shrimp, soaked to
           -soften
      4    Dried forest mushrooms,
           -soaked to soften and cut
           -in match stick
      1    Piece Chinese preserved
           -turnip, rinsed and finely
           -minced
      1 ts Oriental sesame oil
 
  Glutinous rice is a sticky rice high in the B vitamins.  Many Chinese
  cat it in the winter time because its high protein content keeps them
  warm.
  
  Place rice in a heat proof earthen pot.  Add water and bring to boil.
  Lower heat to medium and cook, uncovered, until all water is
  absorbed. Combine remaining ingredients and place on top of rice.
  Cover and cook at lowest heat for 20 minutes.  Let stand for 10
  minutes before serving.

      Title: Goan Pork Vindaloo in Pungent Brown Sauce
 Categories: Indian, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Boneless pork shoulder
  1 1/2    Piece tamarind pulp (see
           -note)
     14    Dried red chile peppers,
           -seeded, coarsely chopped
  1 1/2    Sticks cinnamon
     20    Cloves teaspoons Coriander
           -seeds
      2 ts Cumin seeds
      2 ts Black mustard seeds
    3/4 ts Black pepper corns
      2 tb Minced fresh ginger
      2 tb Minced garlic
    1/2 c  Cider vinegar
    1/2 c  Peanut oil
      2    Onions, chopped
           Salt
 
  It's interesting, as I go through this humungous pile of newspapers,
  to see how my tastes have changed over the past three years.  Some of
  the things I marked then, I find myself discarding now.  Some of the
  stuff that didn't interest me at the time, I'm scanning to save.
  This one was on the list then and is still on the list.
  
  Trim the meat and cut into 3/4-inch pieces.
  
  Place the tamarind in a nonmetallic bowl; pour in 1 1/2 cups hot
  water and let soak at least 1 hour.  Work the tamarind with fingers
  to squeeze out as much pulp and juice as possible.  Strain into a
  bowl and set aside. Discard the residue.
  
  Heat a dry skillet over medium heat.  Add the chile peppers, cinnamon
  sticks, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mustard seeds and black
  peppercorns; roast the spices, stirring and shaking the skillet
  constantly, until the coriander, cumin and chile peppers turn several
  shades darker, and all the spices release their fragrance.  This will
  take 3 to 4 minutes, Transfer to a bowl and let cool.  Grind the
  spices in a spice grinder and set aside.
  
  Put the ginger and garlic in a medium-sized non metallic bowl with the
  vinegar.  Blend in the ground, roasted spices.  Add the meat and mix
  thoroughly to coat with the spice mixture.  Cover the bowl and
  refrigerate overnight or up to 48 hours.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pan, add onions and cook until they turn
  reddish brown, 12 to 20 minutes.  Add the meat (with its marinade) in
  two batches, stirring and searing the pieces over medium-high heat.
  Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until almost all
  the liquid evaporates and fat separates from the mixture.  You will
  see small pools of fat on the surface.
  
  Stir in the tamarind and some salt; cover and simmer until the meat
  is very tender, about 1 hour.  Check the water content from time to
  time, and add 1/4 cup hot water once or twice.  Serve hot with
  steamed rice.
  
  NOTE:  Tamarind is found in cake form at Indian markets.

      Title: Gobhi Paratha
 Categories: Indian, Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      4 c  Whole-wheat flour
      1    To 3 cups cold water
    3/4 c  Ghee

MMMMM--------------------CAULIFLOWER FILLING-------------------------
      2 tb Ghee
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh ginger
           -root
      1 ts Finely chopped garlic
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onions
      1 ts Turmeric
    1/8 ts Ground hot red pepper
      1 md Cauliflower, trimmed, and
           -coarsely chopped
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh hot
           -green chili (CAUTION)
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Salt
      6    To 8 tablespoons ghee
 
  Indian Flat bread with spiced cauliflower filling
  
  DOUGH:
  
  Prepare the whole-wheat dough in the following fashion:  In a small
  bowl, combine the whole-wheat flour and 1/4 cup of the ghee.  With
  your fingertips rub the flour and fat together until they look like
  flakes of coarse meal.  Pour 1 cup of water over the mixture all at
  once, knead together vigorously, and gather the dough into a compact
  ball.  If the dough crumbles, add up to 2 cups more water, 1/4 cup at
  a time, until the particles adhere.
  
  On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough by folding it end to
  end, then pressing it down and pushing it forward several times with
  the heel of your hand.  Repeat for 7 or 8 minutes, until the dough is
  smooth and elastic.  Again gather it into a ball.  Place the dough in
  a bowl, drape a kitchen towel over the top, and let it rest at room
  temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling it.
  
  CAULIFLOWER FILLING:
  
  Meanwhile, in a heavy 10 to 12-inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of
  ghee over high heat until a drop of water flicked into it splutters
  instantly. Stir in the ginger and garlic, then the onions.  Lower the
  heat to moderate and, stirring constantly, fry the mixture for 7 or 8
  minutes, until the onions are soft and golden brown.  Watch carefully
  for any sign of burning and regulate the heat accordingly.
  
  Stir in the turmeric, red pepper, cauliflower, chili, cumin and salt.
  Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly and cook for 10 minutes, or
  until the cauliflower is tender but still slightly resistant to the
  bite. To make the parathas, divide the cauliflower mixture into 9
  equal portions. Divide the dough also into 9 portions and drape a
  dampened kitchen towel over them to keep the dough moist.
  
  One at a time, on a lightly floured surface, roll a ball of dough
  into a round about 5 inches in diameter.  Place a portion of the
  filling mixture in the center of the round and fold the edges over
  it, pressing them together to enclose the filling securely.  Pat the
  filled paratha flat with your hands, then gently roll it again to
  make a round about 5 inches in diameter.  As you shape and fill the
  parathas, set them aside, covered with a dampened kitchen towel to
  keep them from drying out.
  
  Heat an ungreased 10 to 12-inch skillet with a non stick finish or a
  well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or griddle until it is hot enough for
  a drop of water flicked into it to splutter instantly.  Place one of
  the parathas in the pan and, moving it about constantly with your
  fingers or the edge of a metal spatula, cook for a minute or so.
  With a wide spatula, turn the paratha over and brush about a teaspoon
  of the ghee on the top. Cook for 2 minutes, then turn it over, spread
  with another teaspoon of ghee and cook for I minute.  Turning
  frequently, continue to cook until the paratha is brown on both
  sides.  (When you have mastered the technique, you will find you can
  fry 2 or 3 parathas at a time, depending on the size of your skillet
  or griddle.)
  
  Serve the parathas warm, as a mealtime bread.  They are traditionally
  accompanied by plain yoghurt or any rayta.  Parathas may be cooked
  ahead and reheated in a hot ungreased skillet for a minute or so on
  each side.
  
  Makes nine 5-inch breads.

      Title: Golden Pigeon with Winter Melon
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 12 servings
 
    600 g  Winter melon
     12    Chinese ham slices (0.5 cm
           -thick)
      2    Young pigeons (approx 500 g
           -each or a 1-kg chicken)
      4    Ginger root slices
      4    Shallots (white parts)
           Cooking oil

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Light soy sauce
    1/8 c  Dark soy sauce

MMMMM---------------------STEWING SEASONING--------------------------
      1 ts Oyster sauce

      4 c  Stock

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 c  Stock
  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch (mixed well with
           -2 tbs water)

MMMMM---------------------GARNISH (OPTIONAL--------------------------
     10    Sprigs of flowering chives
 
  I used Cornish Game Hens, but you could also use a cut up chicken. If
  you can't get winter melon, watermelon will work.  Winter melon is
  white, very mild tasting and a tad denser than watermelon.  I think
  you could get away using something like Honeydew too.  Have fun!

  "Happy Bird Crosses The Golden Bridge" presents an attractive image
  featuring the pigeon, a symbol of happiness to the Chinese.  The
  inclusion of winter melon, a summertime seasonal vegetable, as the
  imagined "golden bridge" is a culinary play on words:  the dish
  combines two traditional dishes providing a bridge between their
  contrasting textures and flavours. The garnish - flowering chives -
  is more than an aesthetic detail, symbolizing the greenery growing
  along the water's edge.
  
  To prepare:
  
  1.  Mix the marinade and coat pigeons with it for 2 to 3 minutes.
  
  2.  Remove skin of winter melon and cut 12 slices about 5 cms wide,
  
  3 cms long and 2 cms thick.  Make a slit sideways on the longest side
  of each piece and insert one ham slice.
  
  To cook:
  
  1.  Deep-fry pigeons over a medium flame until golden.
  
  2.  Heat the wok or pot, add 1 tbs oil.  When it is very hot, stir-
  fry ginger and shallots for 1 minute.  Then add above stewing
  seasoning ingredients and pigeons, cover and braise over a slow flame
  for 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove pigeons.
  
  3.  Reserve 1 cup of the pigeon braising stock, to make sauce later.
  
  4.  Double the remaining braising stock's liquid volume by adding
  water, then immerse winter melon slices.  Cook for 5 minutes, then
  turn off heat. Cover wok, leave winter melon slices for a further 5
  minutes (thus ensuring they do not lose their shape through excess
  direct cooking).
  
  5.  Mix sauce ingredients with reserved cup of pigeon braising stock
  and heat.
  
  To present:
  
  1.  Cut pigeons into pieces and arrange across serving dish.
  
  2.  Place 6 overlapping winter melon slices on each side of pigeons.
  
  3.  Pour sauce over, and garnish with flowering chives.
  
  Makes 12 servings.

  baking soda.
  
  Put the butter and brown sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. With
  the paddle attachment, cream them on medium-high speed for 2 minutes,
  until light and fluffy,
  
  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Decrease
  speed to low, and stir in the dry ingredients alternate with the
  buttermilk. Stir in the reserved cocoa paste and the vanilla.
  
  Divide the batter evenly among the 3 pans.  Bake for about 25 minutes,
  until a cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean. When the
  cakes are cool, unmold them by running a knife around inside edge of
  each pan and inverting onto racks.

      Title: Granny's Ham and Potato Gratin for a Crowd
 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
     10 lb "boiling" potatoes
           Salt
      8 c  Garlic and mustard sauce
      5 oz Butter
      1 c  All-purpose flour
  6 1/2 c  Hot milk
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
      1 pn Nutmeg
      2 lg Cloves of garlic, pureed
    1/4 c  Dijon-type prepared mustard
    1/2 ts Thyme or sage
      4 c  Coarsely grated cheese *
  1 1/2 qt To 2 qts cooked ham **
 
  * Swiss or a mixture such as Swiss, mozzarella, Jack, and/or Cheddar
  [I actually used all four kinds. Worked out okay.  S.C.] ** diced,
  thinly sliced, or ground (to make 6 to 8 cups)
  
  Here's my contribution to the thread on scalloped potatoes and ham.
  As far as I'm concerned, no others need apply.  This is the best I've
  ever tasted. It's from my new Julia Child book, "The Way to Cook".
  
  Also++since the recipe is for 18 to 24 servings++it'll give the folks
  with amount-converting recipe programs a chance to put them through
  their paces. ;-}
  
  Here is a great crowd pleaser, as well as a deliciously economical
  one that needs only a copious salad, a loaf of bread, and a jug of
  light red wine to make the meal.
  
  For 18 to 24 servings
  
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:
  
  A food processor is useful for slicing and grating; and 8-quart
  covered kettle; a heavy-bottomed 3-quart saucepan, for the sauce; a
  buttered 6-quart baking dish about 3 inches deep, for the final dish
  
  THE POTATOES:
  
  Have ready the kettle containing 4 cups of cold water.  Peel the
  potatoes and slice them 1/4 inch thick, dropping them into the cold
  water to cover as you do so.  Cover the kettle, and bring to the
  boil.  Uncover and boil slowly for 3 to 4 minutes, until barely
  cooked through++eat several slices to check.  Drain, cover the kettle
  again for 3 to 4 minutes to firm up the potato slices, then uncover.
  
  THE GARLIC AND MUSTARD SAUCE:
  
  Make the classic white sauce; cook the butter and flour together in
  the saucepan until they foam and froth for 2 minutes without
  coloring. Off heat pour in half the hot milk; whisk vigorously to
  blend as you pour in the rest; simmer for 3 minutes, stirring.
  Remove from heat and whisk in the seasonings; bring to the simmer
  again; taste carefully, and add additional seasonings to taste.  [I
  didn't type in the sauce referred to. It was essentially a longer
  version of what's given above along with tips on handling it.  S.C.]
  
  ASSEMBLING:
  
  Spoon a 1/16-inch layer of sauce on the bottom of the buttered baking
  dish. Set aside 3 cups of the sauce and 1 cup of the cheese for the
  topping. Now, to arrange everything in 4 layers, start with a quart
  of the potatoes, then a quarter of the ham, follow by a third of the
  sauce and sprinkle on a third of the cheese.  Continue in layers,
  finishing the final layer with the remaining potatoes and ham; spread
  on the reserved 3 cups of sauce to cover completely, then the last of
  the cheese.
  
  AHEAD OF TIME NOTE:  May be prepared a day in advance, cover when
  cool and refrigerate.
  
  An hour or so before you plan to serve, preheat the oven to 375f.
  
  Bake in the upper third level just until the potatoes are bubbling
  hot and the top has browned nicely.  About 45 minutes.
  
  AHEAD OF TIME NOTE:  May be kept warm uncovered on a hot tray but be
  sure not to overheat or the potatoes and ham will dry out.

      Title: Grilled Dried Beef (Thit Bo Kho)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Lean bottom round or
           -sirloin, in one piece,
           -about 6 inches in
           Diameter
      2    Stalks fresh lemon grass,
           -or 2 tablespoons dried
           -lemon grass
      2 sm Red chile peppers, seeded
  2 1/2 tb Sugar or honey
      1 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
      3 tb Light soy sauce
 
  Here's a Vietnamese version of beef "jerky" made with red chilies and
  honey or sugar that sounds like it's off in the direction of your
  Chinese Dried Fried Beef recipe.
  
  This Vietnamese-style "beef Jerky" is delicious served with drinks.
  The Vietnamese enjoy eating it as a snack with glutinous rice.  It is
  also an ingredient in Green Papaya Salad.
  
  Cut the beef across the grain onto very thin 3 by 3 inch slices. If
  you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper
  half of the stalk.  Cut into thin slices and finely chop.  If you are
  using dried lemon grass, soak in warm water for 1 hour.  Drain and
  finely chop.
  
  Combine the chiles and sugar in a mortar and pestle and pound to a
  fine paste.  Add the chopped lemon grass, fish sauce and soy sauce
  and stir to blend.  (If using a blender, combine all of these and
  blend to a very fine paste.) Spread the paste over the beef pieces to
  coat both sides. Let marinate for 30 minutes.
  
  Spread out each slice of marinated beef on a large, flat wire rack or
  baking sheet.  Let stand in the sun until both sides are completely
  dried, about 12 hours.  (You can also place a rack on a jelly roll
  pan and let the beef dry in the refrigerator for 2 days.)
  
  Grill the beef over a medium charcoal fire or transfer the rack from
  the refrigerator to the middle of a preheated 400F oven and bake
  until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes.
  
  Serve with glutinous rice.
  
  NOTE:  After cooking, the meat may be kept for up to 1 week in a

 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      4 lb Boneless pork loin roast,
           -fat trimmed
           Salt
           Pepper
      1 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Orange juice
      3 tb Chopped shallots or onions
      1    Clove garlic, minced
    1/4 ts Minced ginger root
    1/8 ts Ground allspice
    1/8 ts Pepper
      3 tb Cornstarch
    1/3 c  Cold water
      1 lb Fresh or frozen cherries
    1/4    To 1/3 cup NutraSweet
           -Spoonful
 
  Dunno how you feel about NutriSweet and such ilk, but I'm posting a
  bunch of stuff from NutriSweets cookbook.  Some of it looks right
  good. Tart cherries in a red wine sauce are the perfect complement to
  roast pork, while they give a dinnertime favorite new taste appeal.
  
  Lightly sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper; place on rack in
  roasting pan.  Insert meat thermometer so tip is in center of meat.
  Roast at 325F until thermometer registers 170F, about 2 hours.
  
  Heat the wine, orange juice, shallots, garlic, ginger root, allspice
  and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to boiling in medium saucepan; reduce heat to
  low and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.
  
  Heat to boiling once more.  Mix cornstarch and cold water; stir into
  boiling mixture.  Boil, stirring constantly, until thickened.  Stir in
  cherries; cook over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat;
  cool for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in NutraSweet Spoonful.  Slice pork
  and arrange on platter; serve with Cherry Sauce.
  
  NOTE:  Tart Cherry Sauce is also excellent served with venison or
  other game.
  
  Makes 12 servings.

      5 c  Vegetable oil
      4 c  Maguey worms, cleaned
      8    Tortillas

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE GARNISH---------------------------
      8    Balls fresh masa, 1 inch in
           -diameter
      8    Limes, sliced
      2    Fresh cactus flowers

  Forgot to include this in the packet from the other board.  Karin
  Brewer sent me the following recipe via snail mail.  Apparently
  there's a large, semi-permanent black hole hovering over her house
  and she's having trouble getting out.  Been wondering where she was...
  
  Maguey worms, a Mexican specialty, are popular in the state of
  Hidalgo, where maguey grows abundantly.  The worms were sold in
  cocoons on the street until a few years ago.  Today, this dish is
  considered to be a delicacy.
  
  Heat 1 cup oil in a thick skillet and fry worms until crisp.  Remove
  and drain on paper towels.
  
  Heat 4 cups oil in a deep saucepan or deep fryer.  Press tortillas in
  a mesh strainer, and fry one by one until they become crisp and take
  the shape of the strainer.  Drain well on paper towels.
  
  To serve, place a little ball of masa on each of 8 plates, and put
  tortilla "baskets" on top, pressing to fix in place.  Fill tortillas
  with worms. Garnish with lime slices and flowers.  Serve with
  guacamole and green sauce.  This appetizer is good with tequila or
  pulque.
  
  The worms can also be used as a taco stuffing.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: Haggis
 Categories: Scottish, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Now Haggis... that's another story... excellent stuff as long as you
  don't dwell too long on the ingredients.
  
  Here's the recipe from the old (and I mean OLD) trusty recipe book.
  
  Scottish National Dish...To prepare it, procure the stomach of a
  sheep and wash the bags in several waters, rubbing them well with
  salt. Then scald them in boiling water, scrape them carefully with a
  knife, and soak them in a strong brine for 12 hours, trimming off any
  sinewy parts or pieces of gristle.
  
  Wash the lights, liver, and heart, and hang them up to dry for 12
  hours; then put them in a saucepan with plenty of water and boil them
  gently. Take the small bag with the windpipe attached, wash it free
  from the brine, put it into another saucepan, with the pipe hanging
  outside the pan and plenty of water, and boil it slowly for about two
  hours.
  
  Rub about a third of the liver through a wire sieve, and chop rather
  coarsely the small bag and 6 ounces mutton suet.  Mix these with the
  liver, adding 1 heaped breakfastcupful of Scotch oatmeal, season the
  mixture with salt and pepper, and moisten with about 1
  breakfastcupful of the liquor in which the lights, etc were boiled.
  
  Let the whole stand for a half hour, then stuff it into the large bag
  and sew it up securely, using strong thread. Put the haggis into a
  large saucepan of boiling water, and place a plate underneath to
  prevent it sticking to the pan.
  
  Boil it quickly for 1 1/2 hours, pricking the bag occasionally with a
  skewer to prevent it from bursting, and add more boiling water as
  needed.
  
  Serve the haggis on a hot dish as soon as it is taken out of the pan
  together with mashed potatoes and bashed turnip.
  
  Naturally... today we would use a plastic bag and perhaps take a
  couple of other shortcuts... but that's the old original way of doing
  it.

      Title: Handy Chinese Tricks for Cooking a Whole Duck
 Categories: Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 info
 
      1    Information
 
  This is an article from the San Francisco Chronicle by Bruce Cost
  about the Chinese philosophy of cooking duck.
  
  Cooking a duck can be intimidating to home cooks.  Unlike chicken,
  there's a layer of fat that can cause problems.  When duck is simply
  roasted, it often cooks unevenly, leaving a lot of excess fat.  In
  addition, much of the potentially delicious skin is discarded.
  
  Chinese cooks solve these problems by applying two or more cooking
  methods to melt away most of the fat while enhancing the flavor of
  the meat. As a bonus, this technique can produce duck skin that is
  succulently crisp.
  
  For example, a duck may be seasoned and hung overnight in a cool, airy
  place, then steamed, perhaps smoked, and finally fried to a golden
  brown. Or, a duck may be browned over high heat in a wok full of oil
  (which melts away some of the fat), drained, and finally simmered in
  a wine/soy/rock sugar sauce, which is reduced at the end of the
  cooking time to a syrupy glaze.  Sometimes just the skin is stuffed
  with boned duck meat, which has been mixed with glutinous rice or
  barley, mushrooms, Chinese dates, lotus seeds and ham; then the whole
  thing is steamed. The famous Peking Duck, which many rank as one of
  the world's greatest dishes, begins by easing the skin away from the
  meat then pumping in air so the whole duck inflates like a balloon.
  The duck then is scalded in a honey-vinegar mixture and hung
  overnight to dry before being cooked. This dish is not a good choice
  for the home cook because the duck is best roasted suspended in a
  special clay-lined oven. The lacquered-looking ducks that hang in
  Chinese delicatessens, sometimes mistakenly thought to be Peking
  ducks, actually are Cantonese roast ducks. After basting the skins
  and hanging the ducks overnight, they are roasted to golden brown
  perfection ++ a sauce of five-spices, star anise, wine and garlic
  simmering in their cavities. For not much more than the price of an
  uncooked duck, these, by the half or whole, make excellent take-out
  food.
  
  The method that follows for making Sichuan Crispy Skin Duck is
  typical of Chinese duck cookery.  It requires a few steps over a
  couple of days, and two cooking procedures, but it's not difficult -
  although frying a whole duck in a wok full of oil may be a new
  experience.

    1/4 c  Hot chili sauce (tuong ot

      1 lb 1/4-inch-wide dried rice
           -sticks (banh pho)
    1/2 c  Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
           Freshly ground black pepper

MMMMM-----------------------ACCOMPANIMENTS----------------------------
      2 c  Fresh bean sprouts
      2    Fresh red chile peppers,
           -sliced
      2    Limes, cut into wedges
      1 bn Of fresh mint, separated
           -into leaves
      1 bn Fresh Asian basil *
           * or regular fresh basil,
           -separated into leaves
 
  "This sublime recipe comes from my mother, a native of Hanoi.  She
  always made the beef stock in large quantities++enough for at least 3
  meals++and froze it in batches until needed."
  
  In order to cut the beef into paper-thin slices, freeze the pieces of
  meat for 30 minutes before slicing.
  
  The night before, clean the bones under cold running water and soak
  overnight in a pot with water to cover at room temperature.  (This
  will help loosen the impurities inside the bones.  When heat is
  applied, these impurities are released and come to the top much
  faster and can be removed, therefore, producing a clear broth.)
  
  Place the beef bones, oxtails and short rib plate in a large
  stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil.  Cook for 10
  minutes. Drain. Rinse the pot and the bones.
  
  Return the bones to the pot and add 6 quarts of water.  Bring to a
  boil. Skim the surface to remove the foam and fat.  Stir the bones in
  the bottom of the pot from time to time to free the impurities.
  Continue skimming until the foam ceases to rise.  Add 3 quarts more
  water and bring to a boil.  Skim off all the residue that forms on
  the top.  Turn the heat to low and simmer.
  
  Meanwhile, char the clove-studded onions, shallots and ginger
  directly over a gas burner or under the broiler until they release
  their fragrant odors. Tie the charred vegetables, star anise and
  cinnamon stick in a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth.  Add
  the spice bag, parsnips and salt to the simmering broth.  Simmer for
  1 hour.
  
  Remove the short rib plates.  Pull the meat away from the bones.
  Reserve the meat and return the bones to the pot.  Simmer the broth,
  uncovered, for 4 to 5 hours.  Keep an eye on it; as the liquid boils
  away, add enough fresh water to cover the bones.
  
  Meanwhile, slice the beef sirloin against the grain into paper-thin
  slices, roughly 2 by 2-inches in size.  Slice the reserved short rib
  meat paper-thin.  Set aside.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the scallions, coriander and half of the
  slice onions.  Place the remaining sliced onions in a small bowl and
  stir in the hot chili sauce.  Blend well.
  
  Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes.  Drain and set
  aside.
  
  When the broth is ready, remove and discard all of the bones. Strain
  the broth through a strainer or colander lined with a double layer of
  dampened cheesecloth into a clean pot.  Add the fish sauce and bring
  the broth to a boil.  Reduce the heat and keep the broth at a bare
  simmer.
  
  In another pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil.  Drain the
  noodles, then drop them in the boiling water.  Drain immediately.
  Divide the noodles among 4 large soup bowls.  Top the noodles with
  the sliced meats. bring the broth to a rolling boil.  Ladle the broth
  directly over the meat in each bowl (the boiling broth will cook the
  raw beef instantly). Garnish with the scallion mixture and freshly
  ground black pepper.
  
  Serve the onions in hot chili sauce and the accompaniments on the
  side. Each diner will add these ingredients as desired. Yield: 4
  servings.

           -"cheese")
    1/2 c  Sesame seed paste

MMMMM-----------------------GLAZING SAUCE----------------------------
 17 1/2 oz Container of maltose sugar
    1/4 c  Hot water
      2 ts Mui Gwe Lo rice wine
 
  Ran across this in the SF paper the other day and, on reading the
  ingredients, knew immediately that this is one for you.  In the
  article that accompanied the recipe the author talks about a Chinese
  BBQ oven that the chef who originated this recipe uses.  It's made
  out of stainless steel, five feet tall with a 180,000 BTU burner in
  it!  This is something I really need for my kitchen.  This looks like
  a full-on, no- nonsense Chinese BBQ.
  
  Most master chefs seldom reveal all their kitchen secrets, but Derun
  Yu shared this recipe for a barbecued pork marinade, adapted for the
  home oven.  Armed with a Chinese rice bowl, he assembled the
  ingredients, then poured them into a scale so we would have precise
  measurements.
  
  Versatile Chinese barbecued pork is the "ham" of Chinese cooking.  It
  may be sliced and served as an appetizer or entree, or like a
  sandwich, cubed and stuffed in bread dough and steamed into pork
  buns.  It's good stir- fried with vegetables, tossed with noodles or
  cooked with scrambled eggs.
  
  Prepare the marinade:  Heat the oil in a wok or saucepan over
  medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and gently fry just until it floats
  to the surface and is golden brown (about 2 minutes).  Quickly remove
  the garlic and discard.  Pour the garlic oil into a large mixing
  bowl, let cool.
  
  Stir in remaining ingredients with the garlic oil into a smooth
  sauce. Pour into a glass jar. cool.  If the marinade is covered with
  1/8 inch cooking oil, it will keep in the refrigerator for several
  months.
  
  Yields 5 cups.
  
  Then combine the sugar, salt, rice wine, soy sauce, Barbecue Marinade
  and five-spice powder in a large mixing bowl; mix well.  Add the pork
  butt and marinate for about 30 minutes (when using spareribs,
  marinate for 1 hour).
  
  Preheat oven to 500F.  Pour the water into a 10 X 14-inch roasting
  pan. Place the roasting rack in the pan (the rack should not touch
  the water). Remove the meat slices from the marinade and place on the
  rack; reserve the marinade.  Roast for 8 minutes, turn over and roast
  the other side for 8 minutes longer.  Reduce the oven temperature to
  300F.  Brush the pork with the reserved marinade; roast for an
  additional 20 minutes on each side. Remove from the oven and let cool
  for 5 minutes.
  
  Slice the pork butt into 1/4-inch slices.
  
  Prepare the glazing sauce:  To soften maltose sugar, place the
  container (uncovered) in a microwave oven at high setting for 1
  minute. Transfer the softened maltose into a double boiler with the
  water and rice wine; stir until the glaze is well mixed.  Keep the
  sauce warm until ready to use.
  
  Makes 2 cups.
  
  Then spoon a few tablespoons of the glaze over pork before serving.
  NOTE: Hoisin sauce, ground bean sauce, nam yu, maltose sugar and
  sesame seed paste are available in Chinese markets.

  Put the chicken parts, turkey neck and giblets, butter, onions,
  cardamom, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns and cloves into a heavy pan.
  Cover and cook over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Before the mixture begins to brown, add the remaining ingredients
  (except chopped cilantro).  Cover and simmer for 1 hour, skimming off
  as much fat as possible.  Raise the heat to medium and let the broth
  cook, uncovered, for 1 hour.  The broth should reduce to about 7 cups
  during this time. Season with salt and remove from heat.
  
  Remove the pieces of chicken and discard.  Strain the broth through a
  large sieve set over a large bowl, pressing against the vegetables.
  Set aside 3 cups broth to make the harissa sauce.  Serve the
  remainder, piping hot, garnished with cilantro.

           Text Only
 
  Just a faint memory up here what with our fading daylight but well
  worth saving for next year.  This series includes recipes from
  Europey, Turkey and one honest to goodness Ozzy recipe.
  
  Cold fruit soups are popular in central Europe and this recipe for
  strawberry soup from Hungary.  Obviously it is not the sort of thing
  one makes when strawberries are expensive, but at the peak of their
  season it makes a good and unusual starter.
  
  Hull 4 punnets [?] of strawberries into a large bowl (reserving about
  6 to 10 strawberries, depending on their size, for decoration),
  sprinkle generously with sugar and crush thoroughly with a fork.
  
  Add 1 litre of liquid made up of the juice of half a lemon and a 50-
  50 mix of red wine and water.  Taste and if necessary sweeten further
  or add a little more lemon juice.  Chill and decorate with sliced
  reserved strawberries before serving, preferably in clear glass bowls.
  
  Makes 3 servings.

      Title: Honey-Walnut Prawns
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Walnuts
      5 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar
      2 c  Oil
     16 md Prawns, peeled and cleaned
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Egg whites
      2 tb Honey
      3 tb Mayonnaise
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
    1/2 tb Condensed milk
    1/2 c  Oil
 
  Here's a goody.  I normally shy away from Western influenced Chinese
  recipes and would never have fixed this one on my own.  It calls for
  such non-Chinese things as milk and mayonnaise.  My room mate fixed
  it the other night though, and it was excellent.  He was trying to
  duplicate a dish that he and his date had at a Chinese place a while
  back and apparently, this is almost it.  Laurie suggested it would be
  closer to the restaurant dish by just dusting the shrimp with
  cornstarch rather than making a batter. I imagine that it would be
  good either way.  It certainly is good this way!
  
  Rinse walnuts, then boil in 5 cups water, continually changing water
  until clear.  When clear, boil with sugar until sugar dissolves.
  Heat 2 cups oil until almost smoking, then deep-fry walnuts until
  they're shiny and brown, no longer golden.  Remove walnuts to cookie
  sheet, let cool. Mix cornstarch and egg whites together to form a
  thick, sticky texture and mix well with prawns.  Set aside.  Mix
  honey, mayonnaise, lemon juice and condensed milk in a medium bowl
  until smooth.
  
  Heat oil until boiling, then deep fry prawns until golden brown.
  
  Drain, then fold in honey-mayonnaise mixture. mix well, sprinkle with
  walnuts, and arrange on platter.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

      Title: Hot and Cold Shrimp (Goong Kob Poh)
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 kg Medium size fresh shrimp
      7    Red hot chili
      3    Cloves garlic
      1 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Hot water
      2 tb Lime juice
      1 tb Hot sauce *
      1 tb Chopped coriander
           * (Sriracha or Sambel
           -Lampung) [Sriracha is a
 
  Thai hot sauce, available here, and comes in several varieties++ from
  mildly warm to blisteringly hot.  Some of them are quite similar to a
  thick Tabasco sauce which is what I would use for a substitute. S.C.]
  
  Here is a recipe from my new Thai cookbook that is mainly a dip,
  since the shrimp are either grilled or eaten raw with the rest of the
  ingredients. I haven't made this yet, but the dip sounds quite
  similar to the Vietnamese "Nuoc Cham" (which would be good also.)
  
  Peel shrimp, remove the center black line, leave the tail on.  Clean
  and drain, arrange on a plate, chill for 2 hours.  Pound the chili
  and garlic until fine.  Place into a small bowl.  Mix sugar, salt and
  hot water and stir until sugar is dissolved.  Pour over pounded chili
  and garlic. Add lime juice and hot sauce, stir and top with chopped
  coriander.
  
  To Serve:  Thread the shrimp onto the sticks.  Cook over charcoal
  until done to satisfaction.  Dip in prepared sauce to taste.  It can
  be served raw and cold.

      Title: Hot and Sour Shrimp with Watercress And Walnuts
 Categories: Filipino, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Large uncooked shrimp,
           -peeled, deveined,
           -butterflied
      4 tb Dry Sherry
      1 tb Grated peeled fresh ginger
    1/2 c  Chicken stock or canned
           -broth
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Catsup. [See note. S.C.]
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Rice vinegar or white wine
           -vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Oriental sesame oil
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
      6 tb Peanut oil
      2 tb Chopped walnuts
      3 bn Watercress, trimmed
      2 md Bell peppers, cut into
           -1-inch squares
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      8    Green onions, cut
           -diagonally into
           -1-inch-long pieces
 
  This excellent recipe is a relatively quick and easy dish worthy of
  gracing any restaurant's menu.  My roommate fixed it last night for
  three people. It disappeared almost immediately.  Although it says
  that it serves four I'd say that it's about two healthy servings.  Or
  maybe that's just because I'm such a glutton.  Spinach would be an
  excellent substitution for the watercress that the recipe calls for.
  Any kind of nut could be used instead of walnuts.  And rice of
  course...
  
  A light marinade of Sherry and ginger flavors the shrimp, which are
  stir-fried with ted bell peppers and green onions.  Watercress makes a
  colorful bed for the shrimp.  Offer lemon iced tea to go with the
  meal. [Or any good beer.  S.C.]
  
  Combine shrimp, 2 tablespoons Sherry and grated ginger in large bowl.
  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Mix remaining 2 tablespoons
  Sherry, chicken stock, soy sauce, catsup, cornstarch, rice vinegar,
  sugar, sesame oil and cayenne pepper in small bowl.
  
  Heat 2 teaspoons peanut oil in wok or heavy large skillet over high
  heat. Add walnuts and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Transfer walnuts to
  plate using slotted spoon.  Add watercress to wok and stir-fry until
  just wilted, about 1 minute.  Divide watercress among plates.  Add 2
  teaspoons peanut oil, bell peppers and garlic to wok and stir-fry for
  1 minute. Add remaining 2 teaspoons peanut oil, shrimp mixture and
  onions and stir- fry for 1 minute. Stir stock mixture, add to wok and
  cook sauce until clear and thick, stirring frequently, 2 minutes.
  
  Spoon sauce and shrimp over watercress.  Sprinkle with walnuts and
  serve.
  
  NOTE:  I used Jufran sauce rather than catsup.  Jufran is a Philippino
  sauce that's looks and tastes much like catsup.  It's made from
  bananas and other stuff, however and has a more complex and
  interesting taste.  I use it in place of catsup in many recipes as
  well as on hamburgers, hot dogs and corn dogs.  It comes in both mild
  and hot forms.  The mild is not too hot++somewhat like a spicy
  catsup.  The hot stuff is much hotter, although not intolerably so.
  If you use this, be prudent about how much cayenne you use, at least
  the first time until you can see how they balance out.
  
  Makes four servings; about 265 calories per serving.

      2 tb Chopped scallions
      2 tb Chopped fresh coriander
           -leaves
 
  Here's a classic Chinese version.
  
  Put the mushrooms, tree ears and lily buds into a bowl and cover with
  boiling water.  Let stand for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, slice the bean
  curd into strips and set aside.
  
  Combine the pork shreds with the dark soy sauce in a small bowl.
  
  Combine the light soy sauce, vinegar and salt in another bowl.
  Remove the black mushrooms from the soaking liquid, cut off the woody
  stems and discard, then slice the caps thinly and put into a bowl.
  Drain and rinse the tree ears and add them to the mushrooms.  Remove
  the lily buds, cut off the woody tips, slice them in two, then pull
  each apart by hand into 2 or 3 shreds and add them to the mushrooms.
  
  Heat the oil in a wok or large pot.  Stir-fry the pork just until it
  changes color.  Add the tree ear mixture and bamboo shoots; cook,
  stirring for 1 minute.  Add the stock and bring to a boil (you may
  have this simmering in a separate pot), and stir in the vinegar
  mixture.
  
  Adjust the seasonings.
  
  Cook for 1 minute then add the bean curd.  When boiling, give the
  cornstarch/water mixture a stir to recombine and stir into the soup.
  Cook until the soup thickens and clears slightly.  Turn off the heat
  and slowly swirl in the beaten eggs.  Transfer to a soup tureen,
  sprinkle with the pepper, drizzle in the sesame oil, garnish with the
  scallions and coriander and serve.

      Title: Hot Fudge Sauce
 Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  The other day I bought some vanilla ice cream to go with a can of
  chocolate sauce I'd bought about a week before.  I bought the
  chocolate sauce to go on some ice cream that I didn't realize had
  been eaten by my roomy. When we got home, the chocolate sauce ended
  up in the bag belonging to a friend that we'd gone shopping with.
  So, unbeknownst to me, I didn't actually have any chocolate sauce to
  put on my newly acquired vanilla ice cream. I had bought chocolate
  sauce to go on non- existent ice cream and then bought ice cream to
  smother with the by then non-existent chocolate sauce. I didn't find
  this out until stricken by a severe attack of chocolate craving about
  midnight.
  
  I ransacked the kitchen to no avail.  Nada, zilch, zip chocolate
  sauce. "Ah-ha!" I thought...  "I'm a cook++I'll just make some.
  Yeah++ that's it, I'll make some!" Right...
  
  Oooopppsss...  No chocolate.  Hmmm.  But wait++here's some coco
  powder. A quick consultation with Irma and Marion told me I could
  make a substitute for chocolate using coco powder.  Three tablespoons
  powder to 1 tablespoon butter = 1 oz. chocolate.  Bingo!  We're in
  business now...
  
  So I followed the following recipe making the pertinent
  substitutions...
  
  The grand kind that, when cooked for the longer period and served hot,
  grows hard on ice cream and enraptures children.
  
  Melt in a double boiler, over++not in++hot water:  2 oz. unsweetened
  chocolate.  [I used six tablespoons coco powder and 2 tablespoons
  butter. S.C.]
  
  Add and melt:  1 tablespoon butter.
  
  Stir and blend well, then add:  1/2 cup boiling water.
  
  Stir well and add:  1 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons corn syrup.  [I had
  exactly two tablespoons left in the bottle.  Whew!  S.C.]
  
  Permit the sauce to boil readily, but not too furiously, over direct
  heat. Do not stir.  If you wish an ordinary sauce, boil it for 5
  minutes. If you wish a hot sauce that will harden over ice cream,
  boil it for about 8 minutes.  Add just before serving:  1 teaspoon
  vanilla or 2 teaspoons rum.
  
  When cold, this sauce is very thick.  It may be reheated over boiling
  water.
  
  Makes 1 cup.

  I tossed the cocoa powder and the butter in a sauce pan over low heat
  (none of this double boiler nonsense), melted the butter and stirred
  it until everything blended, then proceeded with the recipe as
  directed. Guess what? It worked out GREAT!  The sauce was just a tad
  grainy++ evidently I didn't cook it long enough to quite dissolve all
  the sugar. But what the heck++I'm a texture food freak anyway so I
  didn't see it as a drawback. And the taste really was good.

 Categories: Beef, Ceideburg 2

           Text Only
 
  Well, with all the talk about the corned beef and how much salt it
  has, I dug out the following recipe that was used on the farm to make
  "Corn or Pickled Beef Or Venison."
  
  It is best to cut the meat into 4 to 6 lb pieces.  Have barrel ready
  and spread a layer of salt on the bottom.  Rub each piece of meat
  wtih a mixture of salt and pepper and pack down in layers, covering
  each with a layer of salt.  The top layer should be of salt.  Let
  stand overnight.
  
  In the morning pour on the following brine: For 25 lbs of meat: 3 lbs
  Salt 1/2 t Saltpeter 1/2 c Brown Sugar, Packed Or Molasses 1/2 t
  Baking Soda 2 Gals Water
  
  Dissolve the ingredients in 2 gallons water, stir until salt is
  dissolved. Test with an egg; if it floats, fine if not, add more
  salt. Pour over the packed, salted meat and if necessary, pour on
  more water to cover the meat. Invert a dish over itand put a heavy
  weight on it, to be sure that the meat will not float.  It maybe used
  in 2 to 3 weeks.  For 100 lbs of meat, double all ingredients.

  Seems that blueberries only got to Oz in the early 70's and are only
  now becoming affordable.
  
  This is one of Gabriel Gate's excellent. low-fat recipes.  It was
  first published in his book Smart Food (Anne O'Donovan, 1989) for the
  Anti-Cancer Council.
  
  Blend 500 g blueberries to a puree with the juice of 2 oranges and 1
  lemon.
  
  Strain the mixture.  Stir in 1/4 cup sugar.  Beat together 1 cup
  low-fat yoghurt and 2 tablespoons low-fat milk for about 5 minutes to
  lighten them.
  
  Add 1/4 cup of sugar and beat for a further minute.  Gently combine
  the fruit preparation with the milk and yoghurt mixture.  Either
  freeze in an ice cream maker or put the mixture in the freezer in a
  bowl and as the mixture hardens, whisk it two or three times.  When
  it is too firm to whisk any more, it is ready.
  
  Makes 10 servings.

  Mango sorbet are always delicious but this one has the added interest
  of lime and cardamom flavours.  The recipe comes from the recently
  published "Quick and Easy Indian Vegetarian Cookery" by Sandeep
  Chatterjee. BBC Books, 1992, $16.95.
  
  Put 150 g sugar in a small saucepan with 150 mL water.  Stir until the
  sugar has dissolved then simmer briskly 3 to 4 minutes to make a
  syrup. Remove from the heat and chill.  When it is cold, add it to
  275 g ripe mango pulp, together with the juice of 1 lime and a third
  of a tablespoon of ground cardamom.
  
  Mix well and then freeze in a metal container.  As it is freezing,
  whisk it with a fork from time to time.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

  Here's the recipe for Indonesian Soy Sauce, which I THINK is called
  Kecap Manis.  And even if it's not you might find some use for it...
  ;-}
  
  Put all the ingredients in a large pot and cook on medium till onions
  are limp.  Add sugar and bring to a boil to dissolve sugar.  Strain
  and pour into bottles.  I keep it in the fridge but I don't know if
  you have to.
  
  It's a very sweet Soy Sauce that may take a little getting used to
  but you will probably find that you can use it for things and not
  worry about a "salty" taste.

      Title: Indonesian Potato and Beef Perkedel
 Categories: Indonesian, Potatoes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 15 servings
 
      2 lb Baking potatoes, boiled and
           -mashed
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
      2 ts Ground coriander
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley leaves
      1 lg Egg
      2 tb Peanut oil, plus more for
           -deep frying
      4    Shallots, finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 lb Lean ground beef.
 
  Not too long ago, there was a bit of discussion about potato
  pancakes. (I'm still smarting from all the verbal flack I got about
  my love of instant mashed potatoes...  ;-} ) Here's a recipe with a
  twist from Indonesia. This is traditionally served with soto ayam++a
  kind of chicken soup.
  
  In Indonesia, these fritters are served as part of a rijstaffel
  (rice-table) or as a side dish to embellish a main course.  You will
  find they work well as a delicious appetizer for a Western meal.
  
  Mix together the mashed potatoes, 1 teaspoon of the salt, half the
  pepper, the coriander, nutmeg, parsley and egg.
  
  Preheat a wok until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, the shallots
  and garlic; saute until soft.  Add beef and stir to break up clumps;
  brown until meat is no longer red, about 2 minutes.  Season with
  remaining salt and pepper.  Cool.
  
  Combine the meat with the potato mixture.  Form into 16 balls and
  flatten them into cakes about 2 inches round by 1 inch thick.  Set on
  a tray. Refrigerate, if not fried immediately.
  
  Pour 2 inches of oil into a preheated wok.  Heat to 365F.  Add 4 or 5
  cakes, or as many as will fit into the pan without crowding or
  reducing the temperature of the oil.  Deep fry, turning occasionally
  until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  (If preferred, the cakes may be
  pan-fried in a flat skillet.) Remove to paper towels to drain.  Serve
  hot or at room temperature.
  
  Makes 15 cakes.

      1 c  Plain yogurt, room
           -temperature (1/2 pt.)
           Salt & pepper
 
  It's only touted as "Indonesian-style" but what the hay...
  
  As is the case with most Southeast Asian and South African yellow rice
  dishes, the coloring agent called for here was turmeric, not saffron.
  Yogurt appears in many Indian saffron dishes, however, and I suspected
  saffron would work well here.  It does.  You can substitute California
  pearl rice successfully.
  
  Heat 1/4 cup of milk and steep threads for 20 minutes.  Saute onion
  and garlic in oil.  Add ginger and rice and coat grains well.  Add
  the rest of the ingredients, including the saffron.  Season with salt
  and pepper and cover.  Cook over low heat until rice is done.  Serve
  immediately.

      Title: Introduction To Sushi
 Categories: Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1    Sushi Information
 
  I wrote this for a lady in Rime Cuisine who is interested in
  discovering the wonderful world of sushi.  Thought it might be of
  interest to some of the folks here (particularly timidly eating,
  portly Portlanders... ;-} ).
  
  Helen++you might try "tamago" which is a kind of sweetish egg
  omelette on the rice.  It's very good and not at all "odd".  Also, I
  highly recommend "toro" and "maguro" which are used to make both
  sushi and sashimi. It's raw tuna and has an indescribably clean and
  refreshing taste. (Toro is lean and maguro is "fatty".) Chances are
  if you could taste it and not know what it was, you wouldn't even
  know it was fish.  I *hated* tuna until the first time I tried it raw
  in a Japanese restaurant. "Unagi" is grilled eel and is something
  that almost everyone likes. "Kani" (cooked crab) and "Ebi" (cooked
  shrimp) are quite good and not a taste stretch at all. "Ama ebi" is
  raw shrimp and a bit more for the adventerous, but I think it's
  actually better than "Ebi".  Once again the taste is subtle and
  refreshing.
  
  I think you'll actually be surprised at how subtle the tastes of sushi
  really are.  The thing that *will* get your attention is the wasabi.
  Be very careful when you first try it as it's quite easy to o.d. on.
  It'll be easier for you if you're already a horseradish fan.  I'd be
  careful about stuff with "shiso".  It's an herb somewhat like mint,
  but it can be quite startling to the uninitiated, somewhat like
  cilatro can be.
  
  BTW, there's an excellent book you might like to check out.  It's
  called "Sushi", by Mia Detrick.  Paperback, 95 pages.  Chronicle
  Books, San Francisco.  ISBN:  0-87701-238-5.  No publication date
  given (unless you can figure it out from the ISBN number).  It's
  pretty recent though.
  
  This is a guided tour of sushi eating++the food and the etiquette.
  Not a cookbook as such, though it does have a short section on
  preparing sushi at home.  Primarily, it's an introduction to the food
  with explanations of the ingredients and the most popular types of
  sushi.  The illustrations are all color plates and the book is
  gorgeous.  Each type of sushi is illustrated and explained.  Good
  stuff!

           -(recipe below)
      1 lg Papaya [VERY optional, S.C.]
 
  * Or dry bay leaves soaked in water for about 1 hour.
  
  Grilling time: 1 to 1 1/4 hours
  
  Made this for dinner Sunday.  Thought the ribs got a tad over done.
  Next time I'll cut the cooking time by about fifteen minutes.  The
  recipe doesn't call this a "jerk" type dish, but the spices are
  similar and the slashes in the meat are right up that alley.
  
  Make 1/4-inch-deep slashes between ribs on both sides of spareribs
  slab.
  
  In a food processor or blender, combine onion, garlic, jalapeno
  peppers, allspice, ginger, oil, nutmeg and salt.  Whirl until pureed.
  Rub spice puree over surface and into slashes on both sides of
  spareribs slab. cover and let stand for 1 to 2 hours (or refrigerate
  until next day).
  
  Barbecue ribs by indirect heat.  Distribute bay leaves over meaty
  sides of ribs; then place ribs, meat side up, on grill directly above
  drip pan. Cover barbecue and adjust dampers as necessary to maintain
  an even heat. Cook until ribs are well browned on outside and meat
  near bone is no longer pink; cut to test (1 to 1 1/4 hours).  Near
  end of cooking time, prepare Lime-Dressed Avocado; also cut papaya
  into wedges.
  
  To serve, cut spareribs into 2- to 3-rib portions.  Arrange on a large
  platter with avocados and papayas.  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
  
  LIME-DRESSED AVOCADO:
  
  In a small bowl, stir together 3 tablespoons each lime juice and
  salad oil, 1 teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon each red pepper flakes
  and oregano leaves.  Season to taste with salt.
  
  Cut 3 large ripe avocados in half lengthwise; pit, but do not peel.
  Pour equal amounts of lime dressing into each avocado cavity, making
  sure all cut surfaces are coated.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: Jambalaya
 Categories: Cajun, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Jambalaya is a famous Creole-Cajun recipe from the southern United
  States. The combination of ham with spicy sausages and prawns
  provides an entirely fresh use for the leftover leg.  This recipe is
  adapted from one in America the Beautiful Cookbook (Weldon Owen,
  1992).
  
  Heat a little oil in a large saucepan or a deep frying pan with a lid
  and gently fry 2 chorizos (spicy Spanish sausages++or use Italian
  sausages) until brown.  Set sausages aside.
  
  In the same pot gently fry:
  
  1 large onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced, until limp.
  
  Add:
  
  2 capsicums, one red, one green, seeded and chopped 2 large tomatoes,
  seeded and chopped Pinch of sugar 1 teaspoon of fresh thyme, chopped 1
  teaspoon (or more to taste) of chiles powder Pinch of cayenne pepper
  
  Cover and cook over a low heat for 15 minutes.
  
  Cut the sausages in slices and add to the pot, together with 1 cup
  long-grain rice and 1 cup or more of chopped ham.
  
  Add 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock, bring to the boil, cover and cook on
  very low heat until the rice is tender++about 20-30 minutes.
  
  Stir in 500 g of small peeled prawns and cook, covered, just until
  they turn pink, about 5 minutes.
  
  Stir in 3 tablespoons chopped parsley and serve.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: Jane Grigson's Tomato Tart
 Categories: Italian, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This recipe is based on one from the Piedmont region of Italy.  It is
  a traditional Italian marriage of basil with tomatoes.  The eminent
  food writer Jane Grigson had a fine contempt for too much concern
  about cholesterol, so Raw Materials has substituted olive oil and
  less of it for the butter in the original recipe.  If you share her
  feelings, go for the butter.
  
  Slice 1 kg of tomatoes into half-centimetre rounds.  Season them with
  a little salt and pepper and a pinch of sugar and set aside.
  
  Roll out puff pastry (using frozen is fine++life is too short to make
  puff pastry and there is now a brand made with polyunsaturated oil)
  to line a 25 to 28 cm tart tin with a removable base.
  
  Dip the tomato slices in cornmeal coating them on both sides, and fry
  them slowly in a little olive oil until golden brown.  Layer the
  slices into the pastry case.  Sprinkle the top with chopped basil,
  then with 2 tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese.  Sprinkle with a
  few drops of oil.
  
  Bake in a preheated 230C oven for 15 minutes,then lower the heat to
  190C and cook for a further 20 minutes or so.  Serve straight from
  the oven before the tomato juices can make the pastry soggy.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

  Chef Regina Charboneau makes these for her 2-year-old son, Jean-Luc.
  Place a heavy sauce pot over medium heat and let preheat for about 3
  minutes; add turkey wing, stir and turn until it begins to release
  some of its oil. (If pan is hot enough, you should not have a problem
  with sticking.) Add diced onion and stir to brown for about 3
  minutes, adding garlic at end.
  
  Add green beans, potatoes and water (enough to just cover the
  vegetables) then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender,
  which may take 35 to 45 minutes, depending on size of potatoes.
  Season with pepper and salt to taste (the turkey wing usually adds
  enough salt).

      Title: Jellyfish, Daikon and Chicken Breasty Salad
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried, salted whole
           -jellyfish
      1    1-pound daikon radish
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 lg Chicken breast
    1/2    Egg white
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Sesame oil
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Dry sherry
      3 tb Peanut oil
      2 tb Sesame oil
      3    Scallions, chopped
 
  Here's a classic Chinese "texture" dish, a cold salad made of with
  dried jellyfish.  I know jellyfish sounds bizarre, but, after
  soaking, the jellyfish has a texture similar to woodears-crunchy and
  crisp with little taste of its own.  I consider the addition of the
  chicken to be a sop to those who like to see recognizable things in
  their food...
  
  Actually, this would probably be quite good with just the chicken or
  just the jellyfish.  It has a light dressing made of mixed oils and
  wine. Very nice on a hot summers day.  More than likely, you'll have
  to go to a Chinese market to get the jellyfish.  This is another
  recipe from my huge pile of clippings.  It's from the SF Chronicle,
  but I don't know the date.
  
  Soak the jellyfish in a large bowl of cold water for 24 hours,
  changing the water a couple of times.  Peel the daikon with a
  vegetable peeler; slice thinly; stack slices and cut into matchstick
  shreds.  Put into a mixing bowl, toss with the 2 teaspoons of salt
  and let stand 1 hour.
  
  Meanwhile, drain water from jellyfish.  Pour boiling water over the
  jellyfish and let stand for 15 seconds.  Drain and run under cold
  water. Set aside.
  
  Bone the chicken breast and slice thinly; cut slices into shreds. Mix
  chicken with the egg white, cornstarch and teaspoon of sesame oil;
  refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  
  While the chicken is marinating, cut jellyfish into the thinnest
  possible shreds by rolling up each sheet and slicing it thinly.
  Place in a large bowl.  Wring most of the moisture from the daikon
  shreds; add to the bowl with the jellyfish.  Heat 3 cups water in a
  saucepan.  When boiling, turn off the heat and add the chicken
  shreds, stirring to separate the pieces. Simmer for 1 minute.  Drain
  and rinse under cold water. Drain and add to the bowl with the
  jellyfish.
  
  Blend the salt and sugar with the wine until they dissolve.  Heat the
  oils in a saucepan and add the seasoned wine.  It will sputter and
  evaporate. When the oil is hot++don't let it smoke++turn off the heat
  and add the scallions.  Cool.  Toss with the salad just before
  serving.

  I was browsing through my book on Asian foods today++nothing in
  surimi as such, but here's what it says about Kameboko which is very
  similar, if not the same thing...  I suspect the process for making
  surimi is much the same.
  
  Firm, slightly rubbery-textured cakes of ground fish are a popular
  ingredient in Japanese cooking.  They are added to soups, simmered
  dishes and noodles and are served as hors d'oeuvre.  The name comes
  from an ancient word for the "cattail" reed.  Fish is pureed, bound
  with a starch-usually kuzu, arrowroot or potato formed into blocks
  and steamed.
  
  Sometimes food color-most often pink-red, but occasionally green,
  yellow or brown-is brushed over the top to give an attractive slice
  when cut.
  
  It is sold in vacuum-sealed packs that should be refrigerated and used
  within one week.  To use, slice kamaboko and add in final stages of
  cooking, as it needs only to be heated.

      Title: Kangaroo Escalopes with Spinach and Anchovy Butter
 Categories: Australian, Kangaroo, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    600 g  Kangaroo fillet, trimmed
      2 bn Of English spinach
     12    Anchovy fillets
    200 g  Unsalted butter
      1 ts Lemon juice
      1 ts Black pepper freshly ground
      1 ts Sea salt
           Olive oil
 
  "Skippy" isn't something you make peanut sauce with in Oz.  It's an
  Ozzie term for kangaroo...  Naturally the first thing a non-Ozzie
  (and probably more than one Ozzie) eater will ask about kangaroo
  is++"What does it taste like?" This blurb from the accompanying
  article gives a hint. And it don't taste like chicken...
  
  "Most people won't have ever tasted kangaroo.  It is a sweet,
  strong-tasting meat, it's texture and taste described as somewhere
  between venison and liver...To eat kangaroo, you have to like game;
  you have to like offal and you have to be a red meat eater...It's a
  very big, very strong-tasting meat."
  
  Slice the kangaroo fillet into thin slices, three per serve.  Brush
  with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with black pepper.  Remove stalks
  from spinach and wash leaves thoroughly.  Plunge into rapidly boiling
  water for 30 seconds.  Strain and immerse immediately in iced water
  to stop the cooking process and maintain the green colour.  When
  cold, remove leaves from water and squeeze out as much liquid as
  possible.
  
  Refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  Soften 100 g unsalted butter and blend in food processor with the
  anchovies, lemon juice and a pinch of sea salt and pepper until
  smooth.
  
  Scrape out onto a piece of foil and form into a sausage shape.
  Refrigerate until firm Heat a large, heavy-base, cast-iron fry pan or
  grill plate until hot.  Toss in the oiled meat slices and quickly
  sear on each side. Do not turn until the first side is properly
  sealed++this does not take very long++and don't overcook.  Remove
  meat and rest in a warm place until all the meat slices are cooked.
  In another pan, over medium heat, melt the remaining butter, add the
  squeezed spinach and the salt and pepper, and stir until the spinach
  is hot.  Divide the spinach into four portions, spoon onto the centre
  of the plate, top with three escalopes. Slice the anchovy butter so
  it begins to melt over the hot meat. Serve immediately.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: Kare Ikan (Fish Curry)
 Categories: Indonesian, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2    Lb, cleaned weight fish
      6    Shallots or
      1 lg Onion
      2    Cloves garlic
      2 ts Ground coriander
      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Powdered lemon grass or
      1    Blade fresh, lemon grass
      1 ts Chilli powder
      1    Salam leaf or bay-leaf
    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/2 c  Tamarind water
      1 c  Of thick santen (coconut
           -milk)
      2 tb Vegetable oil
           Salt
        sl Cucumber
           Mint
 
  Fish curry is the literal translation of kare Ikan; but I should
  explain that Indonesian 'curry' is rather different from Indian
  curries. The recipe may be used for almost any fish.  In the former
  version of this book I suggested salmon steaks, which it suits well;
  but these are now rather expensive.  It is better to select a white
  fish with firm flesh, such as haddock, angler-fish, swordfish or
  dogfish.  In Australia the various fish known as whiting would be a
  good choice.  Americans might like to use snappers. Whatever fish is
  used, it can be cut into small cubes or slices before frying.  Heat a
  little oil in a heavy frying-pan, and carefully brown the fish in it.
  Meanwhile, in another frying-pan, fry the chopped shallots (or onion)
  and garlic until tender. Stir in the chilli, ginger, turmeric,
  coriander, lemon grass, salam, salt and tamarind water. Let this
  mixture simmer for 10 minutes, then put in the fish. Cover, and
  simmer for another 10 minutes.  Add the santen and cook for a further
  5 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with very thin slices of cucumber and
  chopped mint. (Alternatively, put the cucumber and mint into the kare
  itself for the last 2 minutes of cooking.) Incidentally, the same
  kare can be made with prawns. There is no need to fry the prawns
  separately; but fry them in the mixture of onion, etcetera for a few
  minutes before you put in the tamarind water. Makes 4 servings. From

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Sugar, brown, dark

  1 1/2 c  Soy sauce, light
    3/4 c  Molasses, dark
    1/2 ts Galangal, ground
    1/2 ts Cilantro, ground
    1/2 ts Pepper, black
 
  Sure...Kecap (or, more commonly, "ketjap") refers to a number of
  sauces from Indonesia; the most common is ketjap manis, which is the
  Indonesian kind of soy sauce, and is rather sweeter than Chinese soy
  sauce or Japanese shoji or tamari.  (It's pronounced "ketchup", btw.)
  
  Recipe follows:
  
  Number of Servings: 40 Approx. Cook Time: 0:30
  
  Combine and sugar and water in a 2-quart stainless steel saucepan and
  bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until the sugar
  dissolves. Increase the heat to high and cook briskly, uncovered, for
  5 minutes or until the syrup reaches 200F on a candy thermometer.
  Reduce the heat to low, stir in the soy sauce, molasses, galangal,
  cilantro, and pepper, and simmer for 3 minutes.  Remove from the
  heat; let cool.
  
  Strain the sauce through a fine sieve set over a bowl.  Sauce will
  keep at room temperature for 2 to 3 months if tightly covered.

           No Ingredients Found
 
  I thought I'd pass along some hints to help those of us that get into
  trouble from time to time.  It's not recipes, but what the heck!
  
  If you've over-salted soup or vegetables, add cut raw potatoes and
  then discard once they have cooked and absorbed the salt.
  
  A teaspoon each of cider vinegar and sugar added to salty soup or
  vegetables will also remedy the salty situation.
  
  If you've over-sweetened a dish, add salt.
  
  A teaspoon of cider vinegar will take care of too-sweet main dishes or
  vegetables.
  
  Pale gravy may be browned by adding a bit of instant coffee straight
  from the jar.  No bitter taste, either.
  
  If you will brown the flour well before adding to the liquid when
  making gravy, you will avoid pale or lumpy gravy.
  
  If time allows, the best method of removing fat is refrigeration
  until the fat hardens.  If you put a piece of waxed paper over the
  top of the meal, it can be peeled right off, along with the hardened
  fat. Ice cubes will also eliminate the fat from soup and stew.  Just
  drop a few into the pot and stir; the fat will cling to the cubes;
  discard the cubes before they melt.  Or, wrap ice cubes in paper
  towel or cheesecloth and skim over the top.
  
  A slice of soft bread placed in the package of hardened brown sugar
  will soften it again in a couple of hours.
  
  A little salt placed in a frying pan will prevent splattering.
  
  Meat Loaf will not stick if you place a slice of bacon on the bottom
  of the pan.
  
  Vinegar brought to a boil in a new frying pan will prevent foods from
  sticking.
  
  No sticking to the pan when you're scalding milk if you'll first
  rinse the pan in cold water.
  
  A lump of butter or a few teaspoons of cooking oil added to water when
  boiling rice, noodles, macaroni, or spaghetti will prevent boiling
  over.
  
  A few drops of lemon juice added to simmering rice will keep the
  grains separate.
  
  A dampened paper towel or terry cloth brushed downward on a cob of
  corn will remove every strand of corn silk.
  
  To determine if an egg is fresh, immerse it in a pan of cool, salted
  water. If it sinks, it is fresh; it it rises to the surface, throw it
  away.
  
  Fresh eggs' shells are rough and chalky; old eggs are smooth and
  shiny.
  
  To determine if an egg is hard-boiled, spin it.  If it spins, it is
  hard-boiled.  If it wobbles, it is raw.
  
  Egg shells can be easily removed from hard-boiled eggs if they are
  boiled in salty water and quickly rinsed in cold water.
  
  No "curly" bacon for breakfast when you dip it into cold water before
  frying.
  
  Keep bacon slices from sticking together; roll the package into a tube
  shape and secure with rubber bands.

  Now watch this sleight of culinary hand as I effortlessly slip across
  national boundaries and across hemispheres to inextricably link the
  cuisines of Denmark and Mexico.
  
  Klipfish is salted dried cod, and Danish klipfish is so good that
  large quantities of it are exported to Spain, where "bacalao", as it
  is called there, is much appreciated.
  
  Cut 2 lbs. of fish in pieces and soak for 24 hours in lukewarm water
  (or milk, if desired) with a teaspoon of soda.  Take up the fish, cut
  off the fins, and scrape the skin.  Put over the fire in cold water
  without salt and cook for half an hour until quite tender.
  
  Serve on a hot platter garnished with parsley and with boiled
  potatoes, melted butter, mustard sauce and a dish of diced, hard
  boiled eggs (figure one egg per person).

      2    Or 3 Tomatoes
           Fried Onion Flakes
 
  Here's another, similar, recipe that's a bit more elaborate.  Made it
  once and it was quite good.  I usually make the other as it's more
  simple. The Nasi Kuning is more of a side dish while this makes a
  pretty satisfying meal.
  
  Heat the oil in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat until
  hot. Add the rice and stir until it begins to brown, now add the
  cloves, cinnamon, turmeric and pepper; stir for a minute or so.  Pour
  in the broth, add the salam or bay leaf and cumin.  Bring to a rapid
  boil then cover and reduce the heat to a very low simmer.  Simmer for
  about 40 minutes. Stir in the chicken and raisins; cover again and
  let sit, off the stove, for a few minutes before serving.  Garnish
  with egg and tomato slices and the Onion Flakes.
  
  This is the basic Recipe.  For variety try a teaspoon of ground chili
  instead of the black pepper.  Other meats could be substituted for the
  chicken.  Indonesian Crisp Beef is quite good with this, using it as a
  garnish instead of mixing in with the rice.  Try anything you like,
  but don't put anything in to cook along with the rice, it might upset
  the liquid ratio and spoil things.  The rice should come out with the
  grains separate and no stickiness.

      Title: Korean Bread
 Categories: Korean, Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Malt flour
      2 lb Of red pepper powder
      5 lb Wheat flour
      1 lb Soybean flour, fermented
      1 ga Water
      1 lb Salt
 
  Lately I've been getting more into Japanese cooking which is different
  enough from Chinese that I had to do some serious larder stocking. It
  took visits to three different stores but I finally come up with the
  basics. One of the the stores turned out to be++ta da!++a Korean
  market so I now have the malt flour you keep referring to.  In fact,
  I just put the first loaf utilizing it into the bread machine a few
  minutes ago. Depending on how this loaf turns out, I'll post the
  recipe I've worked out for oatmeal bread.
  
  This Korean market is a fairly decent sized store for a hole in the
  wall and they have just about everything one would need for Korean
  cooking, including a fresh meat counter.  Nice find!  I'm used to
  buying things with labels I can't read, but a lot of the stock in
  this store didn't have *any* labels at all!  This stuff was obviously
  locally produced by the Korean community and some was recognizable as
  Kim Chee, various bean pastes and the like, but with some of the
  stuff, I had absolutely no idea what it was++or even whether it was
  animal or vegetable in origin. I'll go back when I have some time and
  find out what all those goodies are.
  
  Here's a recipe that was on the bag of malt flour I thought you might
  get a kick out of.  This is exactly the way it appeared on the bag.
  Put malt flour into lukewarm water and set aside for about 1 hour.
  
  Pour the malt melted water into pot (throw away the button setting).
  Put wheat flour into malt water, and make slow boil on low heat, and
  then simmer for about 1 hour.  Remove the glue from heat and mix
  fermented soy bean flour and then lastly add hot pepper powder and
  salt, and mix well. *As for salt, you may add or reduce to your taste.
  
  *For soup use (Chigae), you better add more fermented soy bean flour.

      Title: Kung Op Wun Sen (Baked Prawns and Mungbean Noodles)
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Prawns
      5    Coriander roots, crushed
      1 tb Pepper corns
      1    Onion, thinly sliced
      3 sl Ginger, crushed
      2 tb Cooking oil
      1 tb Maggi sauce
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      2 tb Light soy sauce
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Whiskey
      2 c  Mungbean noodles, soaked
           -and cut into short lengths
 
  Here's a goody that came out of my new Thai cookbook.  It's easy and
  quick to do and quite tasty.  It's a baked dish, which is unusual for
  Thai cooking.  I suspect that originally, it would have been steamed.
  Next time I'll try it that way or put a tablespoon of water or sherry
  in each bowl. It seemed a tad dry to me.  I cooked it in individual
  French onion soup bowls with lids.
  
  Place the oil in a wok, heat and stir fry the coriander root, ginger,
  pepper and onion.  When fragrant, remove from the wok and place in a
  mixing bowl.
  
  Add the noodles, the sauces. salt, sugar, sesame oil and whiskey,
  toss the noodles until well coated, and then add the prawns and toss
  well once again.
  
  Divide the noodles and prawns into four individual portions; place
  each portion in a lidded cup, and close the lids.  Place the cups on
  a baking tray and bake at 460F until the prawns are done (about 10
  minutes).
  
  Serve hot with fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes and spring onions.
  Serves four.

  Kongpan and Pinyo Srisawat.  SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989.

  If you can buy coriander bunches with the roots untrimmed you'll be
  in good shape.  If not, substitute stems.  I left it out as the
  person I was eating with doesn't like coriander at all.  It doesn't
  say to, but I cracked the peppercorns slightly before adding them to
  the mix.  By light soy sauce, they mean like in thin soy, rather than
  as in "lite" soy sauce.
  
  Maggi Sauce is a condiment sauce++originating in France, I believe++
  popular in Asia.  It's somewhat like a slightly thick soy sauce.  It
  can be found in the gourmet sections of supermarkets as well as in
  Asian markets. If I didn't have any, I'd use thick Chinese soy in
  it's place. If you can find the Maggi Sauce grab it.  It lasts
  virtually forever in the fridge. Get a small bottle, though.  I run
  across very few recipes that call for it.  It's used as a table
  condiment in Asia and is often seen on the tables at Vietnamese
  restaurants here in the States.
  
  The mungbean noodles are the thin, clear "cellophane" noodles.  I'd
  have no qualms about using the similar thin rice noodles if I
  couldn't find mungbean ones.
  
  I picked up a neato garnish from the photo with this dish.  It shows a
  green onion "brush" with a slice of red pepper around the middle.
  Quite attractive and easy to make.  Cut a slice of scallion++the
  whitish part++about an inch and a half long.  Slice a fresh red chili
  into quarter-inch slices.  Take a length of scallion and push the
  seeds and pulp out of the chili slice.  Slip the rind down to the
  middle of the piece of scallion, then cut the exposed pieces of
  scallion with a thin, sharp blade all the way through.  Make two cuts
  vertically, then rotate the scallion and make two more cuts.  Do both
  ends, then toss the bundle into a bowl of water with lots of ice
  cubes and the slit ends will curl up making a nice, tassley looking
  garnish that's great to eat too.  The trick is to get chilies that
  are about the same diameter as the scallions so it's a snug fit.
  Just toss a couple of the chilly, frilly scallions into each bowl
  before serving.  It's a little touch, but it adds a lot to the
  appearance of the dish.

  This looks pretty tasty++lamb fillets stuffed with minced chicken and
  served with potato pancakes.  The presentation looks like something
  seen through a kaleidoscope++overlapping triangles formed by the
  three lamb fillets, the potato pancakes, the morels and the sauces.
  Here again, I believe that "shallots" are in reality scallions.  The
  "pork net" is more than likely a web of caul fat.

  To prepare: 1. Soak morels over night in cold water and wash
  thoroughly Discard stalks. 2.  Cut off and discard lamb fillet's
  stringy part. Season fillet with salt and pepper.  Using barbecue
  skewers, pierce through fillet lengthways, stretching meat apart
  slightly to form a central hole about 1.5 cms wide. Stuff chicken
  force meat into hole (one way is to use a piping or icing bag). 3.
  To make port wine sauce:  either make a beef stock which includes
  sauteed mixed vegetables, herbs (rosemary, thyme and black pepper)
  and tomato paste, or liquefy the contents of a gravy sauce packet to
  produce a thick 1/3 cup of gravy.  Add port wine, maintaining a thick
  consistency. Keep warm. 4.  To make chive cream sauce: saute chopped
  shallots in a little oil, add Madeira wine, few drops of white wine,
  and chicken stock.  Boil until thick, then add cream. Strain and add
  chopped chives, pinch of sugar, and salt and pepper according to
  taste. Keep warm. 5.  Make 12 small golden-brown potato pancakes.
  Keep warm.
  
  To cook: 1. Saute morels in butter, with seasoning (salt, pepper and
  chicken stock, according to taste) for 2 to 3 minutes. 2.  Lightly
  blanch broccoli florets, then discard stalks.  Saute florets in
  butter with seasoning (salt, pepper and chicken stock, according to
  taste) for 1 to 2 minutes. 3.  Cut stalks off lettuce and blanch
  leaves.  Wrap one layer of lettuce leaves around stuffed lamb.  Then
  wrap it completely with sheet of pork net, folding net over the ends
  to enclose them. 4.  Pan-fry stuffed lamb in melted butter (a
  soupspoonful) over a low flame for approximately 5 minutes until
  lightly browned. 5.  Remove lamb to a roasting dish and roast in its
  own juices in an oven (250F) for 20 to 25 minutes, turning it every 4
  or 5 minutes. 6.  When lamb is cooled, remove from oven, and
  carefully take off pork net wrapping.  Slice the lettuce-wrapped
  fillet into 12 portions.
  
  To present: 1. Dress centre of each plate with a large spoonful of
  chive cream sauce. 2.  Spoon out three separate portions of port wine
  sauce so that they touch the chive cream sauce. 3.  Lay lamb slices
  sideways on port wine sauce. 4.  Place three potato pancakes in
  spaces between lamb slices and lay a broccoli floret on each pancake.
  5.  Garnish chive cream sauce with morels and a central heap of diced
  tomato.  Scatter a few specks of truffle over each lamb slice, and a
  sprinkling of chopped chives over central garnish display.

      Title: Lamb in Cook Pot
 Categories: Chinese, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Lean, boneless lamb from

           -ginger root
    1/8 c  Finely chopped parsley
 
  I picked up a nice little Mongolian fire pot at a sale this weekend.
  That makes two that I have now.  The other is a highly polished brass
  museum piece that I never use for cooking because it's such a hassle
  to clean up. This one is smaller and, with the exterior parts being
  made of a matte finish aluminum, much easier to keep clean.  This is
  the kind you'd see in a Chinese or Japanese place and is just the
  right size for two to four diners.  This one also has a neato
  adjustable grate to control the heat.
  
  I found this recipe stuffed inside the pot.  It was hand-typed.  The
  amounts called for in it would be too much for the little pot I found
  it in, but is sounds quite good and is probably authentic.  You
  generally don't find Nam Yuey (red bean curd cheese) called for in
  Westernized recipes.  The pot is a neat touch, but this can be made
  just as effectively in a fondue pot or in a sauce pan on a tabletop
  burner++in anything that gets the broth hot enough to cook the
  ingredients.
  
  Freeze lamb for 2 or 3 hours for ease in slicing.  Cut against the
  grain into paper thin slices.  Then cut slices into 2 x 2 inch
  pieces. Cover cellophane noodles with 1 cup warm water and soak for
  30 minutes. Drain and cut into 6 inch lengths.  Wash spinach leaves
  under cold running water and pat dry with paper towel.  Arrange on
  platter along with noodles. Trim greens and root ends of the cabbage.
  Separate into stalks and wash thoroughly.  Cut each stalk into small
  pieces and drop into pot of boiling water.  Take out in 2 minutes,
  dry and place with spinach and noodles. Combine soy sauce,
  sesame-seed oil, sherry, brown sugar, peanut butter pepper and bean
  curd.  Mix thoroughly, then take 1 tablespoon of the sauce and put
  into each of 4 bowls.  Reserve the rest and place in small bowl.
  
  Preheat your broiler to its highest point.  Place 8 to 10 charcoal
  briquettes side by side in baking pan lined with heavy aluminum foil
  and place under broiler.  Heat for 10 to 15 minutes until white ash
  forms on briquettes.  Transfer to funnel of cook pot with tongs.  Put
  fireproof (asbestos) mat on table and place cook pot on it.  Bring
  chicken broth to a boil then pour it into the cook pot.  Give each
  person a plate of lamb and a soup bowl.  Drop the scallions, garlic,
  ginger, and parsley into the boiling stock.  Each person cooks own
  lamb with fondue fork and then dips it into sauce in soup bowl.
  Extra sauce is also placed on table.
  
  When the lamb has been used, ladle a little of the remaining stock
  into each bowl.  Add the noodles and vegetables in the remaining
  stock in the cook pot, for a minute or two then ladle with broth into
  bowls as another course.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: Lamb Steamed in Rice Powder
 Categories: Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Piece of boneless lamb
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Light soy sauce
        pn Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
      5 sl Ginger
      1 tb Ginger juice (see note)
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed
      2    Scallions, cut in half and
           -smashed
      2 sm Dried hot peppers, ground
      1 c  Uncooked long-grain rice
      2    Star anise
           Fresh banana leaves (opt,
           -see note)
 
  Cut the meat into "butterfly" slices by making one slice not quite
  all the way through and the second slice all the way through.  Pound
  the meat lightly.
  
  Toss the meat with the soy sauces, salt, sugar, ginger, ginger juice,
  garlic, scallions and hot peppers; marinate for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, make the rice powder by putting the rice and star anise
  into a dry skillet and cook while stirring until the rice is brown.
  (It should be thoroughly browned but not scorched.) Spoon the rice
  and anise into a blender++a food processor won't work++ and blend
  until it's the consistency of fine sand.  (Don't blend it too finely.)
  
  Line two steamer sections with banana leaves cut to fit.  Put half
  the rice powder into a bowl, reserving the rest in a jar for future
  use, and dredge the lamb pieces in the powder, coating them
  generously.
  
  Arrange them on the banana leaves and steam them for 25 minutes.  At
  the end of 15 minutes, sprinkle them with a little water.  Serve in
  the steamer.
  
  NOTES:  Ginger juice is made by covering fresh crushed ginger with
  boiling water and letting it stand for 15 minutes or so.
  
  If you can't get banana leaves, the lamb may be steamed on a plate.

  until limp.  Add Bouquet garni and wine.  Simmer for 1 minute.  Add
  cleaned mussels, cover pan with tight-fitting lid, and steam mussels
  open, shaking pan occasionally.  Check after 3 minutes.  Remove
  opened mussels and set in colander over a bowl to catch their juices.
  Discard any mussels not opened after 6 minutes.  Saute remaining
  shallots in butter until limp. Add mussel juice and cream and reduce
  to desired consistency. Add parsley and garlic, then toss mussels in
  sauce until well coated. Serve in soup bowls.

      Title: Leg of Veal with Anchivies
 Categories: Veal, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Anchovies seem to have a natural affinity with veal - consider ossi
  buci, for instance. those not in the know usually cannot pick the
  presence of anchovies in this pot-roasted dish, but they do rave
  about the flavour.
  
  With the tip of a very sharp knife, make incisions all over the
  surface of a leg of veal.  Into each incision, stuff a sliver of
  garlic and a small anchovy fillet.  Also insert into the meat 4 to 6
  cloves.
  
  Pour a little of the oil in which the anchovies were packed into the
  palm of your hand, rub your hands together and rub them all over the
  surface of the meat.
  
  Put the leg of veal into an oven proof casserole or Pyrex chicken
  roaster, dust with pepper and surround with slices of 2 large onions.
  
  Add a couple of bay leaves and pour over 300 ml dry white wine.
  Cover the casserole and roast in a 160C oven for 2 to 3 hours.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

      Title: Lemon Apricot Pie
 Categories: Pies, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  1 1/3 c  Eagle Brand Sweetened
           -Condensed Milk
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
        g  Rind of 1/2 lemon
      1 c  Apricot pulp
           Baked pie shell (9 in.)
 
  Blend together Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk, lemon juice,
  grated lemon rind and apricot pulp.  Pour into baked pie shell.
  Cover with whipped cream or meringue.  Chill before serving.  If
  meringue is used, beat two egg whites until stiff and add two
  tablespoons of granulated sugar.  Spread on pie and bake in a
  moderate oven (350F) until brown.
  
  To prepare pulp, drain off liquid from canned or freshly stewed
  apricots and force through a coarse strainer.  [These days I'd say
  use a food processor.  Remember, this book is pre-just about
  everything but electric refrigerators.  Prunes can be used in place
  of the apricots. S.C.]

  1 1/2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 c  Chopped walnuts
      4    Thin slices whole-grain
           -bread

  Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins characterize this inventive, egg-free
  recipe from "The New Basics" (Workman, 1989) as "a lovely, light

  Heat the olive oil in a small skillet.  Add the walnuts and saute over
  medium heat until lightly toasted, 3 to 5 minutes.  Set aside. Toast
  the bread; then spread each slice with Anchovy Spread and scatter
  with the toasted walnuts
  
  Tear the lettuce into pieces and toss with the dressing. Place a
  piece of prepared toast on each plate and top with a portion of the
  lettuce and dressing.  Using a vegetable peeler, shave thin slices of
  Parmesan over each portion.  Serve immediately.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  Found a real gem of Americana last weekend.  It's a cookbook of Grange
  recipes.  For those from other parts of the world (and big US
  cities), a grange is an association of farmers++they were big in the
  past in the US. This is American heartland cooking++long an canned
  stuff and casseroles. The seafood section was understandably
  short++two pages in a book of some 300 odd pages.  But a couple of
  the entries caught my eye. This one for Lutefisk looks particularly
  interesting.  Any recipe that calls for sawing one of the main
  ingredients naturally catches my eye.
  
  Now, I've never had Lutefisk in spite of being half Swedish.  Both
  sides of my family were busy becoming Americans and none of the
  ethnic delicacies made it down to us third generation kids.  Being a
  full- fledged, All-American boy, I naturally resent being deprived of
  my roots and am eager to sue someone for the grievous affront of
  never having had lutefisk when I was growing up.  Can't for the life
  of me figure out who to sue though...
  
  Traditional on Christmas Eve.  (Dried Imported Cod)
  
  Saw fish into 3 parts, clean thoroughly and place in a wooden bowl or
  pail. Add water to cover and set in a cool place for 5 to 6 days.
  Change water each day.  Remove fish and thoroughly clean wooden bowl.
  Make a solution of water, lime and ashes and allow to stand
  overnight. Drain off clear liquid and pour over soaked fish, set in a
  cool place for 7 days. When fish is soft, remove from solution, scrub
  bowl well and soak fish for several days in cold clear water.  Cook
  in boiling salted water at simmering temperature for about 20
  minutes.  Drain well and serve. The Norwegians serve the fish with
  melted butter; the Swedes serve it with white or mustard sauce. Allow
  1/3 pound per person.
  
  MUSTARD SAUCE:
  
  Melt 1 1/2 T. butter, blend in flour, salt and pepper, add fish stock
  gradually, stirring constantly until thickened then cook for an
  additional 3 minutes.  Add mustard and remaining butter.  Serve with
  boiled lutfisk, haddock or cod.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 cups sauce.
  
  NOTE:  If fish stock is salty do not add salt listed.

      Title: Ma'oa and Pahua Tairo (Tahiti)
 Categories: Tahiti, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    Dozen ma'oa [turbot snails]
           -or pahua [clams]
    500 g  Taioro [juice of grated
           -coconuts, seawater and
           -shrimps]
      3    Onions
      2    Garlic cloves
           Salt and pepper
 
  Here's an illustrative recipe from "Tahitian Cooking".
  
  The turbot snails are available around here++in pet stores for
  something like eight bucks a pop!  They might be available in a
  Chinese seafood market for a reasonable price.  I'll check the next
  time I'm up that way.
  
  The snail of the ma'oa may be extracted from the shell either by
  breaking the shells with a hammer or by boiling them for a few
  minutes if you wish to keep the shells intact.  Wash the snails and
  remove the pocket of black matter.  In the case of the pahua, a
  bivalve, the muscle adhering to the shell should be severed, the
  animal extracted from the shell, and the black matter removed.  Soak
  in fresh water for a few hours. Mix with the taioro, then add the
  chopped onions and garlic plus seasoning. Serve at room temperature.
  [Note that there's no mention of actually cooking the stuff...  S.C.]

      Title: Magic Caramel Pudding (Caramelized Eagle Brand Milk)
 Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Remember awhile back there a thread about boiling Eagle Brand
  Sweetened Condensed Milk in the can to caramelize it?
  
  It's popular in Mexico. This weekend I picked up "MAGIC, the most
  AMAZING SHORT-CUTS in cooking you ever heard of".
  
  It's a proprietary cookbook put out in the late teens or early
  twenties by the Borden Company.  The women all look like Betty Boop's
  mother, the stoves all have legs and fridges are referred to as
  "automatic refrigerators" and have ornate hinges and latches. Seems
  like way back in 1857 Gail Borden perfected the technique for canning
  milk and the rest is history.  The book presents a series of "magic
  tricks" and then later has recipes that use the end results of the
  "tricks". Anyway, one of the first things I ran across was this
  recipe.
  
  Place one or more unopened cans of Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed
  Milk in a kettle of boiling water and keep at boiling point for three
  hours, being careful to keep can well covered with water.  Chill
  thoroughly.
  
  Remove from can as follows:
  
  Warm can by immersing in hot water about one minute.  Punch a hole in
  bottom of can, remove top with can-openeer, cutting along the side,
  just below top edge, starting at seam.  Loosen caramel from sides of
  can with a table knife dipped in hot water.
  
  Turn on to plate. Cut in slices with knife dipped in hot water.
  
  NOTE:  If a pressure cooker is used to caramelize the milk use 15
  pounds pressure for 50 minutes.
  
  As I write this, I'm still savoring the first taste of the finished
  product. It has a rich, butterscotchy flavor and is a nice, very
  light tan color.  The texture is like a pudding.  This has definite
  potential!
  
  This is almost as good as chocolate!  In fact, I can feature this as
  being part of fudge.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
     12 lg Male blue crabs, cleaned
           -and halved, with top
           -shells reserved
      2 c  All-purpose flour, seasoned
           -with salt and pepper.
           Vegetable oil for frying
      6 tb Butter
      6 tb Olive oil
      3    Stalks lemongrass, tops
           -discarded, bulbs finely
           -chopped
      4 tb Minced garlic
      3 tb Hot pepper flakes
      3 tb Kosher salt
      3 tb Sugar
      3    Piece fresh ginger peeled
           -and julienned
      1 bn Green onions, chopped
      4    Or 5 fresh serrano chiles,
           -thinly sliced into rounds
 
  We're seeing more and more of the live Eastern blue crabs out here on
  the West coast.  So far mainly in Asian markets++I have yet to run
  across any at Safeway.  While the Asians are busy furnishing good,
  fresh things to eat at very reasonable prices, Safeway and it's ilk
  are so busy trying to satisfy our banking needs that they don't seem
  to pay much attention to food anymore.
  
  This can be prepared using either the blue guys or the big ol'
  Dungeness crabs.  This reminds me of the first Vietnamese dish I ever
  tried, "Roast Crab" at Thanh Long on Judah street in San Francisco
  years ago. That dish alone won my ever-lasting respect for Vietnamese
  cuisine. It too used butter, though I'm relatively sure it also used
  Chinese fermented black beans for their savory kick and the crab
  wasn't flour coated before frying.
  
  Dredge the crabs in the seasoned flour.  In a large skillet heat oil
  to a depth of 1/2 inch.  Add the top shells and fry over fairly high
  heat, turning, until crispy on both sides.  Remove to paper towels to
  drain. Discard the cooking oil.  Return the pan to medium heat and
  add the butter and olive oil. when the butter melts, add the
  lemongrass, garlic and pepper flakes and saute for about 30 seconds.
  Add the crab halves and sprinkle with the salt and sugar.  Stir well.
  Add the ginger, green onions and serrano chiles.  Cook, stirring
  often for 3 to 4 minutes. Place the crab tops, hollow side up, on a
  platter.  Tuck the crab pieces in the shells. Pour all of the pan
  juices over the stuffed shells. Serve at once, with steamed jasmine

      Title: Mangoes with Sticky Rice
 Categories: Thai, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Coconut cream
      4 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      4    Ripe mangoes
      3 c  Sticky coconut rice
 
  Mix the coconut cream with the sugar and salt, and bring to a boil.
  Simmer for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Peel the mangoes and slice them, removing the stones.  Arrange the
  mangoes on individual plates with rice beside them.  Spoon the sauce
  over the rice.
  
  COCONUT RICE (Khao Man):
  
  Coconut rice can be prepared with another ordinary or sticky rice,
  depending on what sort of dish it is to be served with.  If using
  sticky rice, soak it first in plenty of water for at least two hours,
  but preferably overnight
  
  If prepared with ordinary rice, serve with Salted Sun-Dried Beef (Nua
  Dad Diao) or other savoury dishes.  Sticky coconut rice is delicious
  with mangoes.
  
  2 cups rice 2 cups water 1 cup coconut cream Salt
  
  Rinse and drain the rice and put into a pan with the water, coconut
  cream and salt.  Mix well
  
  Bring to the boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat and cover.
  
  Simmer for 10 minutes.
  
  When all the liquid has been absorbed, cook for a few more minutes
  over low heat.  The resulting slight burning of the rice at the
  bottom of the pan gives extra flavour to this dish.
  
  All these are from "Discover Thai Cooking" by Chaslin, Canungmai and
  Tettoni, Times Editions, Singapore.  1987.
  
  These are typical of the "street food" that one buys from the vendors
  with mini-kitchens on pushcarts all over Thailand.  Thai desserts and
  confections tend to nastily/heavenly sweet and rich.  You might be
  careful using the amount of salt called for in these recipes.  The
  Thais tend to like their stuff saltier than we would.  They even make
  lemonade with salt instead of sugar!

      1    Text Only
 
  This classic Thai dessert combines fresh mangoes with coconut milk and
  sticky (or glutinous) rice.  The latter may be bought in any Asian
  food store.
  
  Cover 250 g of sticky rice with water and soak overnight.  Drain the
  rice and cook in a steamer for 45 minutes (line the top of the
  steamer with cheesecloth or, at a pinch, a tea-towel and spread the
  rice out in it). Then pack the rice into a bowl firmly, pressing it
  down.
  
  In a saucepan, simmer together 700 mL thick coconut milk, 100 g sugar
  and a pinch of salt for about 5 minutes, stirring from time to time.
  
  Pour half over the rice then refrigerate for at least an hour.  Peel
  and slice as many medium-sized ripe mangoes as will provide half a
  mango per serving.
  
  Turn the rice-cake out of the bowl and slice it thickly Serve each
  slice with a fan of mango and spoon over the remaining sweet coconut
  milk.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

      Title: Maple Mustard Game Hens
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    Cornish game hens, about
           -1/4 pounds each
      1 tb Dijon mustard
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Peanut oil or other
           -vegetable oil (not olive)
    1/3 c  Pure maple syrup
      8    To 10 peppercorns
      1 lg Bay leaf, crumbled
      1 lg Garlic clove, quartered
 
  Here's a poultry recipe that uses maple syrup and mustard++a combo I
  sometimes use on BBQ pork ribs.  Looks good here.
  
  Use a sharp chef's knife or kitchen shears to cut the backbone and
  rib cage from the birds.  Starting just to one side of the tail, cut
  all the way to the other end, right beside the backbone.  Repeat on
  the other side. You will now have removed the backbone and the hen
  will lie more or less flat. This makes it easy to see the fans of the
  rib bones.
  
  Remove them, too.  Wipe the meat with a damp paper towel and set the
  hens aside.
  
  Put the mustard in a small bowl.  Beat in the lemon juice with a wire
  whisk, then beat in first the oil, then the maple syrup.  Sprinkle the
  peppercorns, bay leaf and garlic in a shallow noncorrodible pan or
  bowl just large enough to hold the flattened hens in a single layer.
  
  Pour in about a quarter of the marinade.  Add the meat, cut side
  down, and pour the remaining marinade over it.  Cover tightly and
  refrigerate for 1 day (or at least a few hours), turning from time to
  time.
  
  Remove the meat from the refrigerator about 1 hour before cooking.
  
  At cooking time, move the rack so the hens will be in the upper third
  of the oven; preheat oven to 400F.
  
  Drain excess marinade from the hens and arrange them, cut side down,
  in a shallow noncorrodible roasting pan.  Roast for 20 minutes,
  baste, raise the heat to 425F and roast for about 20 minutes more.
  Do not turn the meat, which should be well browned by the end of the
  cooking time.
  
  Serve garnished with the watercress.
  
  Serves 2.

           -ounces
           Oil for deep frying
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      5    Garlic cloves, finely
           -chopped
    1/2 lb Pork fillet, sliced and cut
           -into 1" long pieces
      1    Whole chicken breast,
           -boned, sliced and cut into
           -1" pieces.
      6    Dried Chinese mushrooms
           -(shiitake), soaked and
           -finely sliced.
      2 sm Fresh chilies, seeded and
           -finely sliced.
      3 tb Soy sauce.
           Juice from 2 limes.
      2 tb Rice vinegar.
      4    Or 5 tablespoons sugar,
           -granulated, brown or palm.
      3 tb Fish sauce.
      3 tb Small shrimp++cooked or raw.
      4    Eggs, beaten.
           Handful of bean sprouts
      6    Green onions, finely
           -chopped.
      4 tb Fresh cilantro, chopped
      2    Green onions, cut for
           -decoration.
 
  Optional stuff: crab meat, bean curd, dried shrimp
  
  Tear noodles into handful bunches (inside a large shopping bag to
  avoid a mess).  Heat oil and fry the noodles until they puff up.
  Flip over for a few seconds.  Do this by bunches and drain in bag.
  Pour off oil, leaving 6 tablespoons in wok.  Fry the onions and
  garlic lightly.
  
  Add pork and cook it through.  Add chicken and fry until it turns
  white. Put in mushrooms and chilies and reduce heat.  In a bowl,
  combine soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, sugar and fish sauce.  Add to
  wok and simmer until liquid is reduced by half and starting to turn
  syrupy.  Add shrimp and cook for 1 minute.  Push contents of wok to
  the sides and pour beaten eggs into center of wok.  Let set for a
  minute then stir and add the bean sprouts and drained noodles.  Toss
  LIGHTLY (the noodles are fragile) to mix ingredients and then let
  heat through.  Transfer to serving platter and garnish with cilantro
  and green onions.
  
  NOTE:  Rice vermicelli are also known as rice sticks or cellophane
  noodles depending on where you find them.  All the Asian cuisines
  that I've encountered have some variation of them.  Use the thinnest
  you can find. Other kinds of noodles won't work.  When they hit the
  hot oil, they kinda go "whooosh" and double or triple in size and
  turn a milky white. Kids really like to watch the process.  The oil
  MUST be fresh and hot (375F to 400F) or the centers may be tough.
  
  This recipe makes enough for 6-8 people.  I'd recommend halving it
  for less than that.  It's a sweet/sour dish with the emphasis on the
  sweet. Very tasty and rich.

  Thought you might be interested in these two recipes for a birthday
  cake. Michael, one of my roommates, just had his big 5-0.  He said he
  wanted a mocha cake so I hauled out a couple of fifty year old
  cookbooks and put together this cake.  (Well, they were almost 50
  years old++one was put out in '46, the other in '50.) The cake++the
  first I'd ever made from scratch++turned out great.  It was nice and
  moist, if a tad on the heavy side.  The recipe is actually for
  cupcakes, but I just made one big layer. The frosting is outstanding,
  a definite keeper.
  
  Sift flour, cocoa, soda, baking powder and salt together 3 times.
  
  Cream shortening with sugar until fluffy.  Combine whole egg and egg
  yolks, beat well and add to creamed mixture.  Combine coffee and
  buttermilk. Add sifted dry ingredients and liquids alternately in
  small amounts, beating well after each addition.  Pour into greased
  cupcake pans and bake in moderate oven (350F) for 20 minutes.
  
  Makes 18 medium or 12 large cupcakes.
  
  Frost with Fluffy White Icing.  Melt 1 ounce (square) chocolate with 1
  teaspoon butter and put a band around each cake with teaspoon or

      Title: Microwave Chicken
 Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  This isn't a recipe per se but rather a method of 'browning' a
  chicken in the microwave.  You can combine the process with other
  recipes and come up with a really delicious, visually appealing dish.
  This is from "Micro Wave Meats Step-Step." It's part of the Micro
  Wave Cooking School series put out by Litton.  Barbara Methven wrote
  it.
  
  "When a whole chicken is microwaved uncovered, it is similar to
  conventionally roasted.  The skin does not crisp but it develops some
  browning.  For more even color, use a browning agent or a glaze.  To
  prevent streaking, scrub off any oily film on the chicken skin with a
  vegetable brush and hot water before applying the browning mixture.
  
  "Wash and dry chicken well.  Mix equal parts bouquet sauce and melted
  butter; rub or brush it into skin.  (If preferred, glaze chicken
  after half the cooking time.)
  
  "Place chicken breast side down in baking dish.  Microwave at High
  for the first 3 minutes.  Reduce power to 50% (Medium).  Microwave
  for remainder of first half of time.
  
  "Turn breast side up.  (Glaze, if desired.) Microwave for second half
  of time, or until legs move freely and inner thigh meat is done." The
  bouquet sauce she refers to is Kitchen Bouquet or any similar
  product. I've used thick soy with good results.  (Add a little sherry
  and ginger and you end up with Soy Sauce Chicken.) It's best to rub
  the sauce in with your fingers.  If you use a brush it will probably
  cover as uniformly. About 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine and an
  equal amount of soy or bouquet seem to be about right for a whole
  chicken.
  
  The result is really amazing.  The chicken comes out moist and
  tender, much like a Chinese steamed chicken only brown.  It's good
  just that way with various Oriental dips++mustard, chopped up green
  onions, hoisin sauce, etc.++if you're into that.  I don't use my
  microwave much for primary cooking but this is one dish that I do use
  it for.  In fact, I got so hungry looking at the pictures that I
  think I'll go nuke one now!

      Title: Microwave Roasted Chicken

           Text Only
 
  This looks like good opportunity to repost one of the few things that
  I make in the microwave.  It turns out so good that it's almost
  enough to make me think that microwaves are good for something
  besides defrosting the parrot food.
  
  This isn't a recipe per se but rather a method of 'browning' a
  chicken in the microwave.  You can combine the process with other
  recipes and come up with a really delicious, visually appealing dish.
  This is from "Micro Wave Meats Step-Step." It's part of the Micro
  Wave Cooking School series put out by Litton.  Barbara Methven wrote
  it.
  
  "When a whole chicken is microwaved uncovered, it is similar to
  conventionally roasted.  The skin does not crisp but it developes some
  browning.  For more even color, use a browning agent or a glaze.  To
  prevent streaking, scrub off any oily film on the chicken skin with a
  vegetable brush and hot water before applying the browning mixture.
  
  "Wash and dry chicken well.  Mix equal parts bouquet sauce and melted
  butter; rub or brush it into skin.  (If preferred, glaze chicken
  after half the cooking time.)
  
  "Place chicken breast side down in baking dish.  Microwave at High for
  first 3 minutes.  Reduce power to 50% (Medium).  Microwave for
  remainder of first half of time.
  
  "Turn breast side up.  (Glaze, if desired.) Microwave for second half
  of time, or until legs move freely and inner thigh meat is done." The
  bouquet sauce she refers to is Kitchen Bouquet or any similar
  product. I've used thick soy with good results.  (Add a little sherry
  and ginger and you end up with Soy Sauce Chicken.) It's best to rub
  the sauce in with your fingers.  If you use a brush it will probably
  cover as uniformly. About 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine and an
  equal amount of soy or bouquet seem to be about right for a whole
  chicken.
  
  The result is really amazing.  The chicken comes out moist and
  tender, much like a Chinese steamed chicken only brown.  It's good
  just that way with various Oriental dips++mustard, chopped up green
  onions, hoisin sauce, etc.++if you're into that.  I don't use my
  microwave much for primary cooking but this is one dish that I do use
  it for.  In fact, I got so hungry looking at the pictures that I
  think I'll go nuke one now!

      Title: Microwaved and Barbecued Beef Ribs
 Categories: Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Ketchup cup apple cider
           -vinegar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Chili powder
    1/4 ts Dried oregano
    1/2 ts Dried minced garlic
    1/4 ts Ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Honey
      8    Beef ribs, about 4 pounds
 
  Here are a few more BBQ recipes I found in a July food supplement.
  Scanning sure is great.  I'm finally making progress on my huge pile
  of newspapers! I've never used the microwave for cooking ribs, but I
  imagine precooking them would serve the same purpose as parboiling
  them (which I don't do either...)
  
  Combine ketchup with the vinegar, salt, chili powder, oregano, garlic,
  pepper and honey.
  
  Mix well and marinate ribs in the mixture for 20 minutes in a
  microwave-safe dish.
  
  Cover with plastic wrap and microwave at full power for 10 minutes.
  
  Remove plastic wrap and turn ribs.
  
  Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for an other 10 minutes.
  
  Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are white-hot, or preheat a gas
  grill on high for 5 minutes with the lid closed.
  
  Grill the ribs about 4 inches from the hot coals.  They will take
  about 4 minutes per side.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: Milk-Fed Lamb with Garlic and Tarragon
 Categories: Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  More from the Sydney Morning Herald.  Simplicity itself, this
  French-derived recipe preserves all the tenderness of baby lamb and it
  gives it the intense flavour it tends to lack. The lamb can be cooked
  in an oven-proof, glass chicken-roaster or baked in foil (use at
  least two layers to ensure the parcel does not leak). Having a
  tablespoon or two of jellied stock always at hand is difficult for
  the home-cook, unless you remember always to treasure the cooking
  liquids after baking meats. Pour them into a small container and
  refrigerate -jelled stock separates out underneath a layer of fat
  which seals and preserves the stock.
  
  A leg of suckling lamb weighs about 1 kg.  If you don't want to go to
  the expense of buying suckling lamb, buy the smallest lamb leg you
  can, probably around 1.5 kg.  If you are baking the lamb in foil,
  start by browning the leg all over in a pan brushed with olive oil
  (not necessary if using a glass roaster).
  
  Cut 4 cloves of garlic into slivers, make slits all over the lamb
  with a sharp knife and tuck the garlic slivers inside.
  
  Dust the leg with salt and pepper, put it in the roaster or on foil,
  add a generous handful of fresh tarragon leaves or a tablespoon of
  dried, and 1 or 2 tablespoons jellied veal or chicken stock.  Put the
  lid on the roaster or wrap the leg loosely in foil, sealing the seams
  securely to prevent juices escaping.
  
  Roast at 190C for between 35 minutes (suckling lamb wrapped in foil,
  still pink inside) and 1 hour (larger leg in roaster, well done).
  Rest for 10 minutes before carving.  Serve with the juices spooned
  over the meat. Good with creamy mashed potato to absorb the juices.

  * (a variety of the following):  cabbage, in 1-inch squares; bean
  sprouts; carrots, sliced or julienned; green beans, in 2-inch pieces;
  potatoes or sweet potatoes in large dice; sliced cucumbers;
  watercress sprigs; tomato wedges.
  
  ** (The thin stuff from the bottom of a can of coconut milk.  SC)
  
  This is from a new cookbook I just got.  Haven't tried this recipe
  yet, but it looks dead on.
  
  This is a rather free-form salad of lightly cooked vegetables; the
  exact contents depend on what is available.  What makes it gado-gado
  is the dressing, a creamy peanut sauce.
  
  1.  Remove tofu from package and drain.  Place on a plate lined with
  cloth or paper towels, top with another layer of towel and an
  inverted plate, and place a weight of a pound or more on top.  Let
  stand for 30 minutes, unwrap, and discard liquid.  Cut tofu into
  bite-sized squares or triangles and sprinkle with kecap manis.  Fry
  in 350F oil until golden brown and puffy; transfer to paper towels to
  drain.  Reserve oil to cook peanuts.
  
  2.  One at a time, blanch vegetables in lightly salted water, rinsing
  them in cold water to stop cooking as soon as they reach the desired
  degree of doneness.  Cabbage and bean sprouts require only a few
  seconds; carrots, green beans, and potatoes may take several minutes
  depending on size and tenderness.  Do not blanch cucumbers,
  watercress, and tomatoes. use them raw.
  
  3.  Place Gado-Gado Sauce in a small bowl in the center of a large
  platter. Arrange vegetables on platter around sauce.  Garnish with
  wedges or slices of hard-cooked egg and fried onion flakes.  To
  serve, spoon some sauce onto each plate and dip vegetables into
  sauce. Serves 4 to 6 with other dishes.
  
  GADO-GADO SAUCE:
  
  1.  To prepare sauce in a mortar:  Pound garlic, shallot, galangal,
  shrimp paste, and chile to a paste.  To prepare sauce in a blender:
  Chop together in a 1-cup jar.
  
  2.  In a wok or deep skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until a
  peanut sizzles on contact.  Fry peanuts until lightly browned;
  transfer to paper towels to drain.  When peanuts have cooled, grind
  in a mortar or food processor to a coarse, grainy paste, adding a
  little oil if necessary to facilitate blending.  (May be made up to a
  week ahead and stored covered in refrigerator.)
  
  3.  Remove all but 2 tablespoons oil from pan and reserve for another
  use. Return pan to medium-low heat and add pounded mixture. Cook
  until quite fragrant, but do not burn.  Add peanuts, sugar, and
  coconut milk and bring to a boil, stirring.  Simmer until thick and
  season to taste with salt and lime juice.  Allow to coot to room
  temperature before serving.
  
  Makes 1 cup.

      Title: Mock Chicken (Buddhist)
 Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
 
    3/4 c  Basic chicken stock
      2 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Oriental sesame oil
      1 ts Salt
      8    Dried bean-curd sheets,
           -soaked to soften
           Peanut oil for deep-frying
 
  I got into the cookbooks looking for the Buddhist mock meat dishes
  and ran across a bunch of other "mock" stuff, some of it vegetarian
  and meant to satisfy the craving for meat and some of it meant to
  represent other ingredients not available at the time.  This first
  recipe is for "Mock Chicken".  I'm not sure if the use of chicken
  stock would be permitted to a strict Buddhist vegetarian++I suspect
  not++but I imagine a hearty veggie stock could be substituted.  Dried
  bean curd can give a surprisingly realistic impression of meat
  products.
  
  Bring stock, soy, sugar, sesame oil and salt to boil.  Cool. fold
  bean-curd sheets into oblongs (approximately 4 by 8 inches) and stack
  the sheets on top of each other, spooning the stock mixture between
  each layer. Roll stacked sheets into oblong loaf, wrap in cheesecloth
  and steam on rack over boiling water for 20 0minutes.  Remove
  cheesecloth and fry loaf in deep oil until golden.  Drain and cut
  into 1/2-inch diagonal slices.

      Title: Mock Crab Roe
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
 
    1/4 lb Fresh filet of sole, plaice
           -(flounder) or cod
      6    Egg yolks
      2    Level tablespoons chopped
           -spring onions (scallions),
           -white parts only
      1 ts Sesame oil
    1/4    Level teaspoon MSG
           -[optional, as usual. S.C.]
    1/4    Level teaspoon salt
    1/8    Level teaspoon white pepper
           Fat for deep-frying
      5 tb Soy sauce
      3 tb Vinegar
 
  "When the crab season ended, people were loath to give up the idea of
  being without crab.  The following recipe is an excellent dish, but a
  poor substitute for the heady concentrate of roe found in the furry-
  clawed crabs of the Yangtse lakes."
  
  Steam the fish for 10 minutes and flake it gently.  Mix the egg yolks
  together with the spring onions, sesame oil, MSG, salt and white
  pepper. Add the fish and mix it in.  Fry tablespoons of the mixture
  in fairly deep fat, until the sides are almost brown or pinkish gold.
  The fat will foam, but this cannot be helped.  The final texture must
  be firm. Serve hot with a separate dish of soy sauce mixed with
  vinegar. Excellent with warmed wine.

      Title: Mock Fish (Buddhist)
 Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1 lg Potato, cooked, peeled and
           -slice 1/4 inch thick
      2 tb Flour
           Peanut oil for frying
      1 sm Onion, sliced
    1/2 lb Snow peas
     10    Wood ears, soaked to
           -soften, tough ends
           -removed, cut in slivers
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/3 c  Water
 
  Here's one for mock fish, using potatoes to replace the finny
  critter, that sounds like a pretty tasty vegetarian dish regardless
  of how much the potato resembles a fish. Sprinkle potatoes with flour
  and deep-fry until golden.  Drain and set aside. Pour off all but 2
  tablespoons of the oil, reheat an add onion. Stir-fry for 10 seconds
  and add snow peas and wood ears.  Stir- fry for another 10 seconds
  and add salt, sugar and water. Bring to rapid boil, stirring
  constantly, and cook until peas are just tender crisp. Add reserved
  fried potato slices, heat through and serve. Wood ears are a type of
  mushroom or shelf fungus.  When soaked it has a crunchy, gelatinous
  texture with little taste.  If you can't find them, I imagine that
  you could use the dried mushrooms although they wouldn't give exactly
  the same effect.  A closer substitute would be dried jellyfish, but
  if you're somewhere that sells dried jellyfish, I'm sure that they
  have wood ears as well.

 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
    3/4 lb Pork
      2 ts Wine
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1    Level tablespoon corn flour
           -(cornstarch)
           Oil for deep-frying
      4 ts Brown bean sauce
      1 tb Water
      1 tb Vinegar
      1    Level teaspoon sugar
    1/2    Level teaspoon red pepper,
           -crushed
      1 ts Pressed ginger juice
    1/4 ts Sesame oil
    1/2    Level teaspoon corn flour
           -mixed with 4 tablespoons
           -water
 
  This dish is Szechwanese in origin.
  
  "The annual run of the shad upstream stopped east of Szechwan, where
  they spawned in lakes as large as small seas.  Farther upstream, the
  waters became more turbulent.  The rapids cut through gorges, making
  navigations upstream laborious, and the waters tan too swiftly to
  make lakes where fish could be raised.  This may be the reason for a
  peculiar dish of pork known as Mock Fish, an attempt to reproduce the
  taste of a well-sauced fish. It you close your eyes you can almost
  believe it.  The contrariness of Szechwan cooking lies in the fact
  that veal or beef may be substituted in the recipe below with little
  change in its taste.  The taste of th original substances is all but
  lost in the sauce.  No one seems to mind, because the use of
  seasonings is extraordinary.
  
  Sliver the pork very finely, and marinate it for 2 to 3 hours in a
  mixture of wine, soy sauce and corn flour.  Deep-fry the slivers for
  about 2 minutes, until well browned.  Set them aside to drain.  In a
  bowl, mix together all the remaining ingredients except the corn
  flour and water mixture.  Saute the pork in the bean sauce mixture
  for a few minutes in a deep frying pan, until heated through.  Then
  thicken the sauce with the corn flour flour and water, stirring
  gently to make it smooth.

      Title: More Smorrebrod
 Categories: Danish, Sandwiches, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  SHRIMP SANDWICH: (Rejemad)
  
  The small Danish shrimps are extremely popular delicacies and most
  Danish housewives are virtual masters at peeling them, but it is slow
  work for the beginner.  At restaurants shrimps are always served
  peeled unless the customer specifically asks for unpeeled ones.
  
  Put a fresh leaf of lettuce on the buttered bread and top abundantly
  with cold boiled shrimps.
  
  SMOKED SALMON AND SCRAMBLED EGG:  (Roget Laks og Roraeg)
  
  Put a piece of fresh smoked salmon on buttered bread, and on top of
  that, diagonally across the bread, a strip of cold scrambled egg.
  Decorate with finely chopped green dill.
  
  LOBSTER SALAD:  (Hummersalat)
  
  Mix small pieces of cold but freshly cooked lobster and asparagus in
  mayonnaise seasoned with tarragon vinegar.  Put a lettuce leaf on each
  piece of buttered bread and spread with the mixture.  Garnish with an
  extra piece of lobster and one or two asparagus tips.  Serve
  immediately.
  
  SMOKED EEL AND SCRAMBLED EGG:  (Roget aal og Roraeg)
  
  Cut smoked eel in 2-inch pieces.  Remove skin and back bone.  Put
  enough pieces of eel on a piece of buttered bread to cover it
  completely. Top with slices of cold scrambled egg and sprinkle with
  chives.
  
  FRIED ROE:  (Ristet Torskerogn)
  
  Put boiled cod roe under pressure until cold and cut in 1/2 inch
  slices with a sharp knife.  Fry the slices in plenty of butter, place
  on buttered bread with a lemon slice on top.  Cut the lemon slice
  half way and twist so it will stand upright.
  
  FRIED FISH FILLETS:  (Stegt Fiskefilet)
  
  As the fried fish fillet (of plaice or sole) should be served warm,
  do not place it on the bread as this would melt the butter. Serve
  buttered bread on a separate plate.  Serve with Tartar sauce.
  
  HERRING SALAD:  (Sildesalat)
  
  Cooked meat Cold potatoes Red beets 1 sliced onion Salted and smoked
  or pickled herring Sour mustard Flour Butter
  
  Place the the meat, potatoes, red beets, onion and well soaked
  herring on a chopping board together with the mustard and dice until
  the whole thing has become a mushy mass.  If it is too dry and won't
  stick together add a little vinegar from the red beets, and flavor
  with sugar.
  
  This procedure makes the "fine herring salad" usually made by the
  Danish housewife for everyday use.  But you can make the salad coarse
  too by cutting (instead of dicing) the different ingredients in a
  long narrow strips and blending them with a thick sauce, made of 2
  tablespoons butter and 4 cups flour cooked together and diluted with
  water or stock.  Flavor the sauce with vinegar from the red beets,
  sugar and mustard to taste, and, if necessary, add a few drops of
  coloring until you get a beautiful red shade.
  
  Spread the bread with the herring salad and decorate with slices of
  hard boiled egg, if you don't prefer topping it with a fried egg.

      Title: Narsai's Gado Gado
 Categories: Indonesian, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 tb Butter or oil
      1 lg Onion, sliced
      3    Garlic cloves, sliced
      1 c  Chicken consomme
      1 tb Soy sauce *
    1/4 c  Peanut butter *
      2 tb Heavy cream
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger

           -washed, trimmed
           * Estimated quantities, I
           -lost the original clipping!
 
  This is from Narsai David, a Bay Area restaurateur and food critic.
  Haven't tried it yet, but most of the stuff Narsai comes up with is
  great. Gado Gado is an extremely good Indonesian way to consume
  veggies even if you're not too fond of 'em.  This calls for raw
  veggies, but more authentic recipes call for blanching the veggies
  first.  This is probably for sanitary purposes more than anything.
  
  Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add the onion and garlic and saute
  until they are brown.  Add the consomme, soy sauce, peanut butter,
  cream, ginger and Tabasco sauce and cook slowly for about 10 minutes.
  Puree the mixture in blender or food processor.
  
  The dip may be served warm or cold with an assortment of raw
  vegetables of your choice..
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  If this dish is to be served cold, double the amount of
  consomme to 2 cups.

      Title: Nasi Goreng (Fried Rice)
 Categories: Indonesian, Rice, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Long-grain rice
      4    Shallots or 1 small onion
      2    Red chillis or 1 tsp chilli
           -powder and 1 tsp paprika
      2 tb Vegetable oil or clarified
           -butter or pork fat
           Salt
      1 ts Sweet soya sauce
      1 ts Tomato ketchup
 
  The name Nasi Goreng means simply 'fried rice', and it is really a
  collective description of an indefinite number of slightly differing
  dishes.  You can vary the trimmings and garnishes to suit your taste;
  but even the most elaborate Nasi Goreng is quick to make.  It is a
  particularly good luncheon dish. Boil the rice a good long time
  before you intend to fry it; you can fry freshly boiled rice, but the
  Nasi Goreng will be better if the boiled rice is allowed to cool. Two
  hours is a satisfactory interval. Leaving the rice to cool overnight,
  however, gives less good results-the rice has time to go dry and
  stale. An important point to note here is that rice for Nasi Goreng
  must be cooked with the least possible quantity of water; this
  prevents it from becoming too soft. For 1 cup of rice, use 1 cup of
  water. Assuming you have now got your cool, boiled rice, proceed like
  this: slice the shallots or onion, seed and slice the chilli (or
  pound the shallots and chilli together in a mortar). Heat the oil in
  a wok; it makes no difference, by the way, whether you use oil, fat,
  or butter. Saute the shallots and chilli for a minute or so, and
  season with salt, soya sauce, and tomato ketchup.  Put in all the
  rice, and stir it continuously until it is well heated:  this will
  take 5 to 8 minutes. Serve in a good large dish, generously garnished
  with sliced cucumber, tomatoes, fried onions, and Krupuk.  [Shrimp

      Title: Nasi Kuning
 Categories: Indonesian, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 tb Oil
    2/3 c  Long Grain Rice (Basmati
           -best)
      4    Cloves
      2    Piece Cinnamon
      1 ts Ground Cumin
      1 ts Ground Turmeric
    1/2 ts Fresh Ground Black Pepper
  1 1/4 c  Chicken Broth
      1    Salam Leaf or Bay Leaf
           Fried Onion Flakes
 
  Here's the recipe for Nasi Kuning.  Ignore the reference to Crisp
  Beef. It's not necessary and is a lot of trouble to fix.  Otherwise,
  the recipe is easy and good.
  
  Heat the oil in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat until
  hot. Add the rice and stir until it begins to brown, now add the
  cloves, cinnamon, cumin, turmeric and pepper; stir for a minute or
  so.  Pour in the broth, add the salam or bay leaf.  Bring to a rapid
  boil then cover and reduce the heat to a very low simmer.  Simmer for
  about 40 minutes. Garnish with Crisp Beef, Onion Flakes, thin strips
  of bell pepper, and paper thin slices of cucumber.
  
  FRIED ONION FLAKES: Heat one Tablespoon oil in a heavy frying pan over
  medium-high heat. Add 1/2 cup dried onion flakes and stir until brown
  and crisp.  Stores well in an airtight container.

  Not being quite as temporarily enhanced as some of the other members
  of the echo, I remember Kate Smith as an older buxom gal who could
  really belt out a tune and was fond of wearing her trademark
  low-hemmed, dark, long-sleeved, V-necked dresses.  I was unaware that
  in her younger days she had another persona.  She was a radio
  personality with a cooking show. I know 'cause last weekend I picked
  up a copy of her 1940 cookbook, "Kate Smith's Favorite Recipes,
  Anniversary Edition".
  
  The cover is worth framing.  It shows a very young Kate Smith in her
  signature dress wearing a French maid type apron, bent forward a bit
  at the waist and holding a wooden spoon up in her right hand.  She
  looks mostly like a clean shaven Dom Deluise in drag getting ready to
  whack some unruly kid's knuckles.  The sponsors of her show were
  Calumet Baking Powder and Swan's Down Cake Flour, both of which I
  believe are still going concerns. I think we should adopt Kate as the
  patron saint of the echo and distribute a .gif of the cover of this
  book with the "Cast" .gifs.
  
  Here's a number from the book that utilizes both of her sponsor's
  products.
  
  Sift flour once, measure, add baking powder and salt and sift together
  three times.  Cream butter thoroughly, add sugar gradually, and cream
  together until light and fluffy.  Add flour, alternately with milk, a
  small amount at a time, beating after each addition until smooth.
  Add flavoring. Fold in egg whites quickly and thoroughly.  Bake in
  three greased 9-inch layer pans in moderate oven (375F) for 20 to 25
  minutes. Spread Chocolate Cream Filling between layers and Hungarian
  Chocolate Frosting on top and sides of cake.  When frosting is set,
  write the numbers from one to twelve around top of cake with white
  frosting to represent the face of a clock. Place hands of clock at
  twelve o'clock.
  
  CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLING:
  
  Add chocolate to milk and heat in double boiler.  When chocolate is
  melted, beat with rotary egg beater until blended.  Combine sugar,
  flour, and salt; add gradually to chocolate mixture and cook until
  thickened, stirring occasionally.  Pour small amount of mixture over
  egg yolks, stirring vigorously; return to double boiler and cook for
  2 minutes longer, stirring constantly.  Add butter and vanilla, and
  cool.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 cups filling, or enough filling to spread between three
  9- inch layers.  Use this filling in small cup cakes.  Use 1/2 recipe
  for filling 2 1/2 to 3 dozen small cup cakes.
  
  HUNGARIAN CHOCOLATE FROSTING:
  
  Melt chocolate in double boiler.  Remove from boiling water, add
  sugar and water, and blend.  Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating
  will after each. Add butter, a tablespoon at a time, beating
  thoroughly after each amount.
  
  Makes enough frosting to cover the top of one 9-inch layer and sides
  of three 9-inch layers, or to cover the tops and sides of two 9-inch
  layers. Eat lots of this and you too can look like Kate Smith!
  Probably won't be able to sing as well though...

  lowest heat until the surface is transparent and milk solids are on
  the bottom (45 to 60 minutes).  Pour off the clear liquid and strain
  through a double layer of damp cheesecloth, discarding the spices and
  solids. Refrigerate. If strained a second and third time, the mixture
  will keep either chilled or at room temperature for 2 to 3 months.

  card like books with spiral bindings that you see here and there in
  Asian markets and the like. I'd forgotten how good these recipes are
  since collecting larger and flashier cookbooks, but these are some of
  the recipes that convinced me that I really did want to become
  proficient at Chinese cooking. They are simple, authentic and *very*
  tasty!
  
  This first one calls for beef, but the other night I substituted pork
  for the beef and the result was excellent.  The finished dish is
  rich, as hot as you like it and slightly sweet.  The only "exotic"
  ingredient is the "soy beans with chili condiment" and it's not too
  exotic these days. (Sorry, Jeff++no dried duck webs here!) Any market
  with a good Oriental section should have it.  The stuff I use is put
  out in 8 oz. bottles by Lan Chi and is called "Chilli Paste with Soy
  Bean". It's quite hot and has a wonderful, slightly "smoky" flavor.
  
  (I'm copying these recipes out verbatim to capture the flavor of the
  book.)
  
  This blend of flavors will remind you of hot dishes from other parts
  of the world.  This chili flavor combine [sic] is entirely different
  from the chili used in Mexican dishes, for instance
  
  1.  Mix gravy ingredients in a small bowl.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Heat wok on high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon oil.  Slosh around. Add
  vegetables and stir-fry until half done about 2 minutes.  Remove to
  platter.
  
  3.  Clean wok.  Reheat over high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon oil.  Slosh
  around.  Add beef, garlic and ginger.  Toss-fry for about 3 minutes
  and when meat is pinkish add gravy ingredients.  Stir-fry another
  minute or so until thickened.  Add precooked vegetables.  Toss-fry
  another minute to blend and heat through.

      Title: Nuoc Cham (Vietnamese Chili Sauce for Dipping)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    Dried red chilies
      2    Cloves garlic
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Fish sauce
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  The red stuff can be had in stores.  It comes in a clear plastic
  bottle with a green lid and a red rooster on the plastic.  Or in
  smaller glass jars.  It's called "Tuong ot toi Viet Nam" (tung ot
  toy) and is nothing more than red chiles mashed up with a bit of
  garlic.  You could easily make it by smashing up a handful of the
  little red hot peppers and a couple of cloves of garlic in a mortar
  and pestle.  There's a similar Filipino sauce called "Sambal
  Oeleck"++virtually the same but with the addition of vinegar. Here's
  my favorite recipe for nuoc cham. I have some variants if you'd like
  to see those too.  I use it on a lot of stuff++it's very good with
  poached or white cooked chicken, thousand year eggs, shrimp chips.
  
  Mince chilies and garlic finely and place in a mortar.  Mash with the
  heel of a cleaver or pestle.  Add sugar and stir until it dissolves.
  Add fish sauce, vinegar and lemon juice, stirring between each
  addition. This makes enough for 2 to 4 people.  I almost always
  double the recipe just to make sure there's enough.  I've kept it for
  long periods of time but unless you freeze it, it's past it's prime
  after a few days.
  
  From "Great Asia Steambook" by Irene Wong.  Published by Taylor and
  Ng, distributed by Random House.  1977.  ISBN 0-912738-11-1.
  
  This is a basic chili sauce used for a dip for chicken or whatever.
  Variations of this are found in Cambodia, Thailand and other Southeast
  Asian countries. You can fiddle with it endlessly.  This is a good
  starting point. The proportions shown here produce what I consider a
  mildly warm dip. I generally use two to six times as many chilies,
  depending on their strength and how hot I want it.
  
  VARIATIONS:  Use green serrano chilies instead of dried red ones,
  thinly slice a red or green chili into rounds and toss them in, lime
  juice instead of the lemon juice or palm sugar instead of granulated.
  If you make it in a food processor, don't over process.  It should
  have small chunks of each ingredient rather than being a homogeneous
  liquid. The taste is sour and hot, very puckery.  It's great with
  poached or steamed chicken, duck or game hens.  Much better with
  basically bland dishes rather than something like curry which has
  it's own blend of spices. Good with Chinese white-cut chicken or
  Steamed Ginger Chicken with Black Bean sauce. It's truly addictive
  and I often serve it with meals that are not Oriental in origin.
  Should be good with a firm- fleshed white fish or boiled shrimp or
  crab. Fish sauce is a liquid made with anchovies and salt. It's not
  really fishy tasting.  Look for it in the oriental section of
  supermarkets or at markets catering to Asian clientele.  Tiparos is a
  good brand made in the Philippines.  I prefer Thai or Vietnamese fish
  sauce, but they'll probably be harder to find. A timesaver is to
  combine large quantities of the liquid ingredients and store them in
  the fridge. Then, when you want some Nuoc Cham, just chop up the
  chilies and garlic, pound them with the sugar and add them to the
  liquid.

      Title: Nuoc Leo (Peanut Sauce)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Clove garlic, sliced
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 sm Piece of pork liver (see
           -note below), minced
      1 tb Ground pork
      1 ts Tomato paste
    1/4 c  Tuong
    1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 ts Peanut butter
      1 tb Granulated sugar
  1 1/2 tb Sesame seeds
     10    Roasted peanuts, coarsely
           -chopped [I use unsalted
           -Planter's roasted
           Peanuts.]
           Thin strips of hot pepper
           -for garnish
 
  I prefer the following version.  It's a bit more complex, but one of
  the ingredients might be a bit hard to find++tuong, a kind of soy
  bean paste used in Vietnam.  A good Vietnamese market will have it.
  Using medium heat, fry the garlic in the oil.  Add the liver and
  pork. Lower the heat and add the tomato paste; stir and add the
  tuong. Stir again and add the water and peanut butter.  Raise the
  heat to medium and add the sugar. Boil for 1 minute and transfer to a
  bowl.
  
  Add the sesame seeds to a medium-hot frying pan, stirring constantly
  until browned.  This should take 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the sesame
  seeds to the nuoc leo, along with the chopped peanuts.
  
  The sauce can be garnished with thin strips of hot pepper.
  
  NOTE:  Beef or chicken liver can be substituted, but pork liver is
  preferred.  The piece should be the size of a large chicken liver.

      Title: Octopus Salad
 Categories: Australian, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  Ain't a bit of squid here!  Instead we fall back on the squid's
  digitally impaired cousin, the octopus...  The author of the original
  article, Meryl Constance, cautions buyers to make sure that the
  octopi one buys are pre-tenderized.  She notes that traditional
  Australian methods for tenderizing octopi include using rocks,
  bricks, cement mixers and even washing machines.  (No kiddin'!)
  
  Raw Materials first encountered this salad in Argentina, where it
  could be bought from top-flight delicatessen counters for an instant
  picnic. The pink of the octopus pieces with the green of the herbs
  makes this a very pretty salad.
  
  Prepare a 2 to 3 kg octopus and precook it.  [See note below.  S.C.]
  
  While it is cooking, whisk together in a glass bowl 300 mL good olive
  oil, the juice of 1 or 2 lemons (taste and stop when the balance is
  right), salt, pepper and generous amounts of finely chopped garlic,
  shallots, chives and parsley.  The dressing should be thick with the
  herbs. When the octopus is tender, drain it, cut it up into generous
  chunks and, while it is still warm, fold it into the dressing.  Serve
  the salad at room temperature, with plenty of crusty bread.
  
  NOTE:  Chances are if you buy your cephalopod in a supermar-ket in
  the US it will already be cooked.  If not, follow these steps from
  earlier in the article...
  
  "Cut through the head/body above and below the eyes.  Discard this
  section. Slit the back of the head and turn it inside out, discarding
  all the contents (unless you want to keep the ink sac for a
  particular recipe). Push the beak (in the center of the star of
  tentacles) through and out...Skinning is quite unnecessary and very
  fiddly.  If you prefer to do so, it is much easier after cooking than
  before.
  
  A large octopus needs precooking for many dishes.  Put it in a
  saucepan and just cover with lightly salted water.  Simmer gently
  until the point of a knife slides easily into the meat++maybe one
  hour, maybe longer.
  
  The deep mauve stock which results need not be discarded when you
  drain the octopus.  It is very rich (in fact, it will often set to a
  jelly in the fridge) and makes a wonderful soup..."
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings.

      Title: Octopus with Garlic (Polipi Veraci All'aglio)
 Categories: Italian, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    Octopus (about 1 1/2 pounds
           -each)
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      5    Cloves garlic, crushed
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Cumin seeds
           Salt
      1 sm Green pepper, chopped
           Rosemary leaves and parsley
 
  Cut out the eyes and mouth of the octopus.  Remove the ink sac and
  internal bone.  Cut off the tough points in the tentacles.  Put each
  octopus on a board and beat them well to break the fibers and make
  the meat more tender. Wash them in running water until they are very
  white; do not dry but put them in an earthenware dish and season with
  oil, flavored with garlic, bay leaf and cumin seeds.  Cover the dish
  tightly with a sheet of waxed paper or foil tied around the top with
  string.  Put the dish over a very low heat for 1 to 2 hours,
  according to the size of the octopus. When they are tender, drain
  them, season with additional oil, salt, green pepper, rosemary leaves
  and parsley.  Serve in a tureen.

  It doesn't make reference to it in the text, but in the pictures of
  both these dishes, it shows one or two largish octopi garnished with
  rosettes of baby octopi tentacles.  I imagine you'd do quite well
  using the 'baby' octopi like those I see sold around here in the
  supermarkets, or even with squid.

      Title: Old and Fresh Eggs
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      2    Preserved eggs
      2    Fresh eggs
      1 tb Chicken stock
    1/8    Level teaspoon salt
           Oil or fat
      2 ts Soy sauce
      2 ts Sesame oil
    1/2    Level teaspoon MSG
 
  This is another treatment of Thousand Year Eggs.  It's a bit more
  complex than just eating them with a dip, but is still simple and
  elegant. I'd consider the use of MSG as optional, but authentic. The
  preservation of eggs by alkaline ash turns the white to brown and the
  yolk to green. This colour change is actually very beautiful. Gently
  crack the shells of the preserved eggs and remove the egg white
  (brown) carefully, reserving it. Mash the yolks and combine them with
  the fresh eggs, chicken stock and salt.  Grease a bowl and pour in
  the egg mixture. Steam it for about 20 minutes.  When cool, loosen
  the egg from the bowl, slice it in half and cut each half into thins
  slices. Chop the egg white (brown) very finely, and arrange the
  slices around it. Mix the soy sauce, sesame oil and MSG together, and
  carefully spoon this sauce over the slices only. The sauce will
  gradually seep into the egg.

      Title: Open Sandwiches (Smorrebrod)
 Categories: Danish, Sandwiches, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  There is no doubt that Denmark's open sandwiches (Smorrebrod) are the
  most famous feature of the Danish kitchen.  Strangely enough they are
  not found elsewhere, even in neighboring countries.  Danish
  sandwiches have hundreds of variations and new ones are constantly
  being composed.
  
  From the simple, "flat", four sandwiches that office workers take
  with them to work and eat at their desks accompanied by a bottle of
  milk, they range to the gloriously colored "high" compositions, so
  generous that three are enough for a meal, eaten at restaurants.
  With the latter, piled high with good things, we drink Danish beer,
  which is exported to nearly every country in the world.  With
  Smorrebrod too we drink Danish snaps, a clear, innocent-looking fluid
  to be treated with respect.
  
  Though few really enjoy the taste, it has the power to make you feel
  happier, to loosen your tongue, to banish your inhibitions and to make
  social occasions an unqualified success.
  
  Recipes for some typical Danish sandwiches follow.  In Denmark we
  usually make them with dark rye bread.  The bread should be made with
  whole grain and should be as firm as possible, so that the slices can
  be quite thin. Also white bread can be used, but it should be with a
  heavy texture and it may be toasted.  Fish is usually the starter and
  from there one goes to the meat and salad.  Almost inevitably Danes
  wind up the smorrebrod meal with a piece of buttered white bread on
  which a good cheese has been placed.
  
  FINE PICKLED HERRINGS:  (Fine marinade Sild)
  
  Clean, skin and bone six large salt herrings and soak them overnight
  in milk.  Make a dressing of 1/4 cup tarragon vinegar and 1/4 cup
  ordinary vinegar sweetened with 1/2 cup sugar.  Add 1 chopped onion,
  1 chopped cooked carrot, two chopped pickled gherkins and 1 cup
  tomato ketchup and season with 10 whole cloves and 10 whole
  peppercorns.  Let the dressing stand overnight.
  
  Rinse the herrings, cut in slices and let them stand in the dressing
  for 24 hours before serving.
  
  Drain the herring pieces well before putting them on buttered bread,
  otherwise it might become soggy.  Decorate with some of the onion
  from the dressing.
  
  EGGS AND HERRINGS:  (Aeg og Sild)
  
  Spread slices of hard boiled egg on buttered bread and place one or
  more boned herrings lengthwise on the egg.  Decorate with cress.
  
  CHOPPED EGG AND HERRING:  (Hakket Aeg og Sild)
  
  Skin and bone two smoked herrings carefully.  Boil two eggs until
  hard and put in a glass or large cup together with the herrings. Run
  a sharp knife quickly from side to side until the ingredients are
  finely chopped and thoroughly mixed.  Press the mixture on to
  buttered bread and top with cress.  Makes 4 sandwiches.
  
  SMOKED HERRINGS AND EGG YOLKS:  (Roget Sild med Aeggeblomme)
  
  Butter the bread and top with long, cleaned fillets of smoked
  herrings.
  
  Make a cavity in the center of the fillets with your fingers, circle
  it with a ring of raw onion, and put a raw egg yolk in it.  Pile raw
  onions or chopped radishes at both ends of the yolk.

      1    9-inch pie shell, baked
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar

  This custard pie is similar in style to key lime pie, but flavored
  with orange and topped with meringue rather than whipped cream ++ to
  use up the egg whites that otherwise go to waste.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.  To make the filling, stir together the
  milk, egg yolks, orange juice and orange liqueur.  Pour into the
  prepared pie shell and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until just set.
  Remove from the oven and turn the heat to 450F.
  
  To make the meringue, combine the egg whites and sugar in a metal
  bowl. Set in a pan of simmering water (or place the pan directly over
  lowest heat if desired) and stir for a minute or two ++ your clean
  index finger is t;he best tool for stirring ++until the sugar has
  dissolved and the mixture is warm.  Remove from heat, add the cream
  of tartar and salt, and beat until the meringue stand in soft peaks.
  Spread over the pie and return to the oven for about 5 minutes, until
  golden.  Cool to room temperature.

      4    Shallots
      1    Clove garlic
    1/2    Green or red chilli or

           -water
      2 tb Vegetable oil or clarified
           -butter
 
  Did my first cooking out of my new Indonesian cookbook last night. I
  fixed a stir fried carrot dish to back up a pork/soy stew (originally
  posted by Jen Kuiper) and plain white rice.  Both are very easy to
  fix and quite good.  Here's the particulars.
  
  These are carrots, cut into matchsticks and cooked in a little oil or
  butter. The word wortel doesn't sound Indonesian and isn't. It is
  borrowed from the Dutch name for the carrot, since it was the Dutch
  who introduced this vegetable to Indonesia.
  
  Peel, wash, and cut the carrots into small sticks.  Slice the
  shallots and chilli.  Crush the garlic.  In a wok, heat 2 tablespoons
  of vegetable oil or clarified butter.  Saute the slice shallots and
  chilli for 1 minute, then add the garlic and the carrots.  Stir
  continuously for a minute or so and then put in the stock, or soya
  sauce and water.  Cover and continue to cook for 4 minutes.  Uncover,
  taste, and add salt if necessary. Cook for a further 2 minutes,
  stirring all the time.  Serve hot.
  
  Makes 2 servings.

   * if available; or substitute fresh citrus leaves These banana leaf
  packets filled with a spicy fish mousse make great grill-it-yourself
  barbecued appetizers.  The banana jackets make them wonderfully easy
  to hold in your hand as picnic food.  Or, if you prefer, the filling
  may be spread on toast points for a more formal presentation.
   Otak Otak comes in many variations throughout Southeast Asia. Each
  version contains a rempah, the Malay name for the hand-pounded
  seasoning pastes which are the bouquet garni of Southeast Asian
  cooking.  The traditional Singapore Nonya rempah includes chiles,
  garlic, shallots, lemongrass, turmeric, candle nuts, and shrimp
  paste, although other spices and herbs may be used to enhance a
  particular dish.  Like curry pastes, rempahs are traditionally
  pounded in a mortar.  Although a hand- pounded paste is better, it is
  time-consuming and laborious for the average American cook. I
  recommend starting the paste in a spice mill and/or a mini-food
  processor, switching to a mortar for a final pounding to smooth out
  the rough edges.
   In Singapore, Otak Otak is usually made with a Spanish mackerel
  called tenggiri, but this recipe was developed with milder
  white-fleshed fish.
   1.  Prepare the Rempah.  [Recipe below.  S.C.] 2. Pat the fish dry
  and cut it into 2-inch pieces.  Put the fish in the work bowl of a
  food processor and chop into a fine paste.  Add the salt, sugar,
  white pepper, and egg and process until fully incorporated, about 5
  seconds. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the cooled
  rempah. Beat with a wooden spoon or mix with your hands until smooth,
  about 5 minutes. Remove the spines from the lime leaves and cut the
  leaves into very fine shreds. Fold them into the fish mixture.
   3.  For each packet, dip a square of banana leaf into boiling water
  for 1 to 2 minutes; pat dry.  Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of the fish
  mixture down the middle of the leaf to within 1 inch of the ends.
  Place a shrimp in the middle of the fish mousse and pat it into the
  filling to lie flat. Fold the long edges over the filling (they
  should overlap in the center) to make a flat long packet.  Press down
  lightly to flatten the packet a bit; press the ends shut and seal
  with toothpicks.  (Packets may be prepared to this point up to 2
  hours ahead of time and refrigerated.) 4. Place the banana leaf
  packets on a grill 3 to 4 inches over a medium-hot fire and cook for
  3 minutes per side (open one to test for doneness before serving).
  Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
   Makes 24 packets.
   VAR1AT1ON:  Otak Otak can also be steamed.  Put the fish packets on a
  steaming tray in a wok filled with boiling water and steam over
  medium- high heat for 5 minutes.
   REMPAH:  (Spice Paste) 1 . Cut the chiles just below the stem. Shake
  the chiles to loosen the seeds. Discard the stem and seeds. Put the
  chiles into a bowl and cover them with warm water; soak for 15
  minutes (1 hour is better, if you have the time).
   2.  Cut off and discard the root from the lemongrass.  Re move the
  tough outer leaves until you see a light purple ring.  Use only the
  tender white mid-section; chop coarsely.
   3.  With the motor running, drop the lemongrass down the feed tube
  of a mini-processor; chop as fine as possible.  Add the galangal;
  chop as fine as possible.  Add the chiles and chop as fine as
  possible.  Add the candle nuts, shallots, garlic, turmeric, ground
  coriander, and shrimp paste and process together into a paste (this
  may take 2 to 3 minutes); scrape down the sides of the work bowl as
  necessary.
   4.  Heat 1/4 cup thick coconut milk in a saucepan over medium-high
  heat; stir continuously until thick and oily.  Add the contents of
  the processor and cook gently until the mixture is fragrant and oily,
  about 5 minutes. Add the remaining coconut milk and bring to a boil,
  stirring constantly; cook until incorporated.  Let cool before adding
  to the fish mixture. The rempah can be made a few hours ahead of
  time. From "Asian Appetizers" by Joyce Jue, Harlow and Ratner, 1991.

      Title: Paneer Cooking Hints
 Categories: Indian, Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  Freshly made paneer is delicious and may be eaten immediately, without
  further preparation or adornment.  However, in most recipes, paneer
  must be cooked before it is added to the other ingredients.
  
  Broiling, which is discussed in the story, is the method I prefer
  because very little oil is used.
  
  If you don't wish to broil the cheese, here are a few alternatives:
  
  TOASTER OVEN:  Grease a small baking tray with vegetable oil.  Place
  paneer cubes on the tray and brush with oil.  Bake at 400F until
  golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove and use in any cooked
  paneer recipe.
  
  For a quick paneer curry, place cooked cheese cubes on a heated
  serving platter and pour your favorite curry sauce over them.
  Garnish with minced cilantro and serve.
  
  BARBECUE GRILL:  Prepare a charcoal fire to the gray-ash stage.
  Gently blow away the ash, leaving coals that glow cherry red.  Cut
  paneer into 2-inch cubes.  Brush skewers and paneer cubes with
  vegetable oil.  Thread evenly on skewers leaving 1/2-inch space any
  cooked paneer recipe.
  
  For, an exotic appetizer, sprinkle grilled paneer cubes with. lemon
  juice and ground cumin.  Place on a warmed platter and served
  immediately.
  
  SAUTE:  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a heavy nonstick pan or wok over
  medium-high heat.  When oil is hot, add paneer cubes and saute until
  light brown, turning once.  Carefully transfer to paper towels to
  drain. Tent with foil to keep warm until ready to use.  Use in any
  recipe calling for cooked paneer.
  
  NOTE:  A nonstick pan is essential; the paneer will break and crumble
  in any other pan.
  
  DEEP FRY:  Heat 6 tablespoons of vegetable or canola oil to 350F in a
  nonstick wok until hot but not smoking.  Gently add Paneer cubes.  Do
  not crowd.  Fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 5
  minutes.
  
  Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Tent with foil
  to keep warm until ready to use.  Use in any recipe calling for
  cooked paneer.

      Title: Panfried Quail
 Categories: Game, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  White grapes (to make 1/4
           -to 1/3 cup grape juice)
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts Dried thyme leaves
      8 qt Split and flattened
    1/2 c  (1 stick) unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Virginia ham, cut into 2 by
           -1/4 inch matchsticks
 
  First, make the fresh white grape juice.  Crush the cup of grapes in a
  pestle, then put through a sieve or vegetable mill to extract the
  juice, or use a potato ricer.
  
  Combine the salt, pepper, and thyme, crushing the thyme with your
  fingertips.  Sprinkle both sides of the birds with the seasonings.
  Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat until it foams
  and just begins to brown.  Add the quail, skin-side down.  Sprinkle
  with ham, cover and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the skin is golden
  brown. Turn the birds and continue cooking, covered, until the juices
  run clear, about 4 minutes longer.  Take the pan from the heat and
  let the quail rest, covered, for about 10 minutes.  Arrange the quail
  on a platter and sprinkle the ham from the pan over them.
  
  Pour the fat from the pan.  Add the grape juice (you can also use
  water, if you prefer), and bring to a boil.  Cook for 1 minute,
  scraping the browned bits from the bottom to deglaze the pan.  Pour
  over the quail and serve.
  
  Serves 4.

  grated onion and brown.  Add the paprika and when it bubbles put in
  the chicken pieces.  Turn them over in the onion-paprika mixture.
  Salt them and cover. Braise over a low heat, turning the chicken from
  time to time, for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  The chicken will exude its
  juices and if the sauce is still rather runny when the chicken is
  cooked, add the tomato puree and stir.  Cook a little longer and
  serve.

      Title: Pasta with Meatballs
 Categories: Pasta, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Peeled fresh plum tomatoes
           -or canned Italian plum
           -tomatoes.
      4 tb Butter
      2 sm Onions, chopped fine
      1    Clove garlic, chopped fine
      4 sl Bacon, cooked and crumbled
           Salt and black pepper
    1/2 c  Marsala
    1/2 ts Dried oregano
    1/2 lb Vermicelli
      1 c  Fresh grated Parmesan or
           -Romano cheese

MMMMM-------------------------MEATBALLS------------------------------
    1/2 lb Ground chuck
      2 sl French bread, moistened
           -with 1/2 cup milk and
           -squeezed dry
      1 tb Minced parsley
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
           Salt and ground pepper
      3 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Here's the recipe I made the other night with the nice pasta sauce.
  The meatballs were mediocre, mainly because I'd never made meatballs
  before that I can remember.  The sauce, on the other hand, was very
  tasty. For the pasta I used rigatoni++the first type of pasta I made
  with the new machine.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  1.  Put the tomatoes trough a food mill to puree pulp and remove
  seeds.
  
  2.  In a large skillet or medium saucepan, melt half the butter and
  cook the onions9on until soft.  Add the garlic, tomato puree, and
  crumbled bacon.  Then add salt and pepper to taste and boil this
  sauce hard for five minutes.
  
  3.  Add the marsala and oregano, and cook for another 5 minutes. Set
  aside.
  
  4.  Put all the meatball ingredients except the vegetable oil in a
  bowl, and mix with your hands.  Shape the mixture into 12 balls, and
  in the skillet brown them on all sides in the vegetable oil.  Do not
  overcook, they will cook further in the sauce.  Add the meatballs to
  the tomato sauce and keep warm.  (You can brown the meatballs ahead
  of time and add them to the sauce when you are ready.)
  
  5.  Cook the pasta until al dente, drain well and return to the pot in
  which it cooked.  Add remaining butter and toss well.  Add several
  large spoonfuls of the tomato sauce and toss well again.  Transfer
  pasta to a large serving platter or bowl.  Pour sauce and meatballs
  overall, serve and pass the cheese.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    Ripe but firm avocados
    1/2 ts Saffron threads
      1 c  Pastina (6oz)
      2 c  Chicken stock (480ml)
      2    Fresh tomatoes, skinned,

           Salt & pepper
    1/2 c  Vinaigrette (120ml)
 
  And, of course, there had to be an avocado recipe in the book...
  
  In El Salvador saffron rice is often served with avocado.  I use
  pastina here as an alternative to both rice and couscous, and serve
  it cold, stuffed into avocado halves.  You can use any favorite
  vinaigrette in this recipe.
  
  Heat 1/4 cup of chicken stock and steep threads 20 minutes.  Cook
  pastina in chicken stock with diced onion and steeped saffron.  When
  cooked, drain and mix well with remaining ingredients.  Stuff avocado
  halves. Serve as main course at lunch or first course at dinner.

      7 c  Pitted peaches, peeled, cut
           -in sixths
    3/4 c  Sugar, or to taste
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      4 tb Butter

MMMMM----------------------BISCUIT TOPPING---------------------------
      1 c  Flour
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 ts Baking powder
      4 tb Chilled butter
      6 tb Milk
           Preheat oven to 425F.

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
 
  Place the prepared peaches in an 8-inch square baking pan and sprinkle
  evenly with the sugar.  Drizzle on the lemon juice and dot with the
  butter. Set aside.
  
  TOPPING:
  
  Combine the flour, sugar salt and baking powder in a large bowl and
  stir together with a fork.  Cut the butter into bits and drop it into
  the bowl, then cut it into the flour mixture until dough resembles
  fine, even crumbs. Slowly add the milk, stirring with a fork.  Gather
  the dough together and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Knead
  8 to 10 times, until it is fairly smooth.  Roll or pat the dough into
  a shape that will fit the baking dish ++ it should be no more than
  1/2 inch thick , so trim edges if necessary.
  
  Place the dough over the fruit in the pan, pressing it down into the
  fruit all around the edges.  Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the
  juices are bobbling, the biscuit crust is golden brown and the
  peaches are tender when pierced through the crust with a knife.
  Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack.  Serve warm with heavy
  cream.
  
  Serves 6.

      3 tb Peanut oil
      3 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Minced garlic
           Salt and pepper to taste
      2    Racks baby back ribs, about
           -2 pounds, each
 
  Baby back ribs are cut from the back rib section of the pig, and the
  meat on them is as tender as a center-cut pork chop.  For that
  reason, they can be grilled fairly quickly without any precooking.
  
  Mix mustard with the peach preserves, peanut oil, lemon juice,
  garlic, salt and pepper.  Marinate the ribs in this mixture for at
  least 30 minutes.
  
  Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are white hot, or preheat a gas
  grill on high for 5 minutes with the lid closed.
  
  Grill the ribs about 4 inches from the hot coals.  They will take
  about 6 minutes per side.  Be careful, this sweet sauce burns easily.
  
  Serves 4.

    1/4 c  Roasted peanuts, ground
      1 tb Peanut oil
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 ts Chili paste (tuong ot tuoi)
      2 tb Tomato paste
    1/2 c  Chicken broth or water
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 tb Peanut butter
    1/4 c  Hoisin sauce
      1    Fresh red chile pepper,
           -seeded and thinly sliced
 
  This peanut sauce is somewhat different from a Thai peanut sauce.
  
  It's not nearly as sweet and has no coconut milk in it.  Most
  Vietnamese restaurants I've eaten at serve this along with Nuoc Cham
  and Carrot salad with Cha Gio type dishes.
  
  Prepare the roasted peanuts.  Set aside.  [I use unsalted Planter's

      Title: Peanut Soup
 Categories: African, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 pt Good stock (preferably made
           -from chicken carcass with
           -one onion
      1 pt Shelled peanuts
      1 c  Milk
 
  This is from an old, old book put out for British settlers in
  Nyasaland in Africa.  Not sure what that is today...  The recipe is
  simple and to the point and actually looks pretty good.  I have some
  other peanut soup recipes++Asian ones++that I'll be posting for you
  over the weekend.
  
  Dry peanuts in the oven until the skin can be rubbed off and the nuts
  are a deep biscuit in colour.  Crush with a rolling pin, or mince, to
  a very fine meal.  Strain the stock and simmer with the nut meal for
  1/2 hour or more. Season to taste.  Before serving, stir in milk, or
  even better, 1/2 small tin unsweetened condensed milk, add a little
  butter and serve.

      2 ts Lemon juice
      2 sl Fresh ginger, pared and
           -finely minced
      2 lg Garlic cloves, finely minced
    1/4 ts Paprika
      1 tb Sesame seeds
      4    Skinless, boneless chicken
           -breasts
      2 pk 6-inch flour tortillas
      2 bn Scallions, quartered
           -lengthwise and cut Into
           -2-inch slivers
      1 c  Hoisin sauce or Chinese
           -plum sauce
      4 ts Minced Cilantro or parsley
      7    Sheets Bounty Select-a-Size
           -white paper towel
 
  Well, it had to come to this.  Taking recipes from paper towel ads.
  Sigh... See what new toys will do to you?  And frankly, if you
  overlook the fact that this "Peking" chicken recipe completely
  ignores the spirit of Peking Duck which is cooked primarily for the
  SKIN, it doesn't sound half bad.
  
  For speed as well as convenience, there's nothing like a microwave
  oven. And, remember that any paper product can burn if used
  improperly in a microwave or conventional oven.  In case of fire,
  turn microwave off and leave door closed.
  
  1.  In 12-inch round or oval microwave-safe baking dish combine
  honey, soy sauce, lemon juice, ginger, garlic, paprika and sesame
  seeds. Stir well.
  
  2.  Coat chicken breasts with marinade, reserving extra sauce; arrange
  chicken in ring fashion, with ends touching.  Cover and refrigerate
  for 1 to 2 hours.
  
  3.  Cover with 4 sections of paper towel, tucking ends underneath
  dish.
  
  4.  Cook on HIGH for 6 to 7 minutes, just until chicken loses its
  pinkness in the thickest part.
  
  5.  To heat tortillas, use 3 sections of paper towels.  Place
  tortillas in center and fold over sides.  Heat one stack on HIGH for
  1 to 2 minutes, just until warm to the touch.  Heat remaining stack
  as needed.
  
  6.  To serve, slice chicken and arrange on a platter.  Pass small
  dishes of sliced scallions, hoisin sauce, cilantro and warm tortillas.
  
  7.  To eat, spread sauce on tortilla; place chicken, scallions and
  cilantro inside.  Roll up and eat with your fingers.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      1 tb Black peppercorns
    3/4    Inch piece fresh ginger,

      1 ts Wine vinegar
      4    Firm pears, peeled, halved
           -and cored
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
  Ran across this recipe in an article in the Chron about weird taste
  combinations and thought it worth passing on.  (Never mind the
  comments.) BTW, this is one of the first recipes I entered using
  WordStar 7.0.  When I ran the spell checker on it WS didn't recognize
  "quart" or "vinegar" as words!!!!  Amazing.  "Nam Yuey" I can
  understand, but "VINEGAR"?
  
  These are wonderful served over ice cream or with pound cake. Combine
  the water, wine, sugar, peppercorns, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, salt,
  red pepper and vinegar in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil.
  
  Add the pears and reduce heat to a simmer.  Cook for 10 minutes,
  until the pears are tender, turning every few minutes so they cook
  evenly.
  
  When the pears are uniformly tender, remove to a plate.  Reduce the
  liquid in the pan by half.  Strain into a bowl.  Add the vanilla and
  return the pears to the liquid to cool.
  
  Serve at room temperature.
  
  Serves 4.

 Categories: Mexican, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    To 8 slices fresh fish
           -fillets
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 tb Tarragon leaves, crumbled
    1/4 c  Lime juice
           Butter (enough for baking

  2 1/2 tb Parsley, minced
      1    Clove of garlic, crushed
      1 tb Olive oil
     13    Black olives, pitted
      1 cn Sweet red peppers, cut into
           -strips
 
  Had an outstanding weekend at sales this time, including some neat
  cookbooks++a Danish one, a Mexican one, an Appalachian one, along
  with a small Mongolian Firepot and about two grand worth of software
  that I got for thirty bucks.  Things like Ventura publisher and a
  complete LAN setup including the hardware.  The guy having the sale
  said "Thank God someone came along who knows what this stuff is!" I
  was just thankful I got there first!.  No ridged skillet yet and I
  still haven't found a good wok for Alison, but the sales are really
  picking up again now that spring is here.
  
  Stumbled across this recipe in one of the books and thought it might
  be of at least passing to ya...  ;-} Maybe make it with some nice
  fresh salmon?
  
  Season fish with salt, pepper, and tarragon leaves and soak in lime
  juice for a few minutes.  Set the oven at 375F and bake fish in
  buttered baking dish until it flakes easily when pierced with a fork,
  about 25 minutes.
  
  While fish is baking, combine tomatoes, parsley, avocado, garlic,
  minced onion, oil chili powder, salt and pepper to taste.  (We
  suggest tasting the guacamole as the chili powder is added, so that
  you can get just the degree of heat you desire.)
  
  Spread the above mixture over the cool fish.  Garnish with black olive
  rings and strips of sweet red pepper.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings.

      Title: Piadini
 Categories: Italian, Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      3 tb Oliye oil
    1/2 c  (generous) mixture of half
           -milk, half water
 
  I'm not much of a baker, but these recipes for an Italian bread and
  sauteed greens to stuff in it sounded good...
  
  Mix flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl.  Make a well in the
  center and pour in the olive oil and a little of the milk-water
  mixture. Start to mix the dough with a fork, gradually adding the
  rest of the liquid; you probably will need extra water, depending on
  the absorbency of the flour.
  
  When the dough has come together and leaves the sides of the bowl
  clean, form it into a rough ball and put it on a very lightly floured
  surface. Knead until it is smooth, about 10 minutes.  Let rest for 10
  to 30 minutes, at your convenience.
  
  When the dough has rested divide it into small balls, each about the
  size of a plum.  Roll each ball out into a flat circle about 1/8-inch
  thick. Now put the heavy pan or bakestone on medium heat.  Let the
  pan become hot enough to make a drop of water dance.
  
  Put the first piadina in the pan and press down with a wooden
  spatula. Let cook on one side for 20 seconds or so++when you lift it
  to turn it over it should have whitened, and there will be the faint
  beginnings of small brown scorch marks.  Repeat with the second side
  and turn the bread 2 or 3, times during cooking.
  
  When the bread is ready it will have puffed up like a pocket bread and
  should have small brown spots over its surface; as soon as you have
  achieved this effect, put the cooked piadina on a wire cake rack and
  proceed with the next one.
  
  Serve hot, with slices of prosciutto, salami or cheese, and perhaps
  olives, radishes or a little tomato for a quick lunch.
  
  Makes 10 to 12 breads.

      Title: Pickled African Peaches
 Categories: African, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 lb Slightly under ripe peaches
      3 c  Sliced onions
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Turmeric
      1 tb Ground cumin
      2 ts Minced garlic
      1 ts Minced ginger
      1 ts Dried red pepper
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
    1/2 ts Dry mustard
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 ts Ground cloves.
      2 c  White wine vinegar
    2/3 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
    2/3 c  White sugar
 
  Haven't made this for a couple of years, but it's pretty tasty. Saute
  onions in olive oil for five minutes or until tender.  Add spices and
  saute for 2 minutes.  Stir in vinegar and sugars, then simmer, partly
  covered for 15 minutes.
  
  Blanch peaches slightly in boiling water for 1 minute.  Drain, peel
  pit and slice.  Add to onion mixture and simmer just until tender.
  Transfer with slotted spoon to sterilized mason jar.
  
  Reduce syrup over high heat to 1 1/2 cups.  Add slowly to jars to
  almost cover fruit.  Stir.  Fill jars slowly with syrup, cap loosely
  and cool.
  
  Tighten caps and let stand in dark place at least 2 weeks.
  
  I don't remember where this came from, but I suspect that it was
  either Gourmet or Sunset Magazine.  In my handwritten copy it also
  called for 2 teaspoons ground cumin as well as one tablespoon.  I
  omitted it above, but I think it should have been 2 teaspoons ground
  coriander.

      Title: Pickled Artichokes
 Categories: Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 c  Fresh lemon juice
      4 c  Water
     36    To 40 medium artichokes
      3    Lemons, halved
      4 c  Distilled white vinegar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Garlic cloves
      4    Bay leaves
    1/2 ts Dried basil
      1 ts Dried oregano
      2    To 4 small dried red chile
           -peppers (optional)
      2 c  Olive oil
 
  These pickles are worth every bit of the time it takes to prepare
  them. They're one of the best tasting and most beautiful preserves on
  my pantry shelf.  The pale, creamy yellow leaves around the artichoke
  heart glisten in the oil-herb vinegar brine, and sometimes a faint
  hint of purple on the chokes is evident, too.  Their rustic taste
  recalls the simple antipasti of Italy's country trattorias.
  
  Combine the lemon juice and water in a saucepan large enough to
  eventually hold all the trimmed artichokes.
  
  Prepare the artichokes, one at a time.  Cut off and discard card the
  stem, then halve the artichoke from tip to stem end.  Immediately rub
  the cut surface with a lemon half to prevent discoloring.  Scoop out
  the furry choke, then gently rub the exposed surface with lemon.  Cut
  off the outer layers of leaves, so the only leaves remaining are the
  tender, pale yellow ones.  Older or larger artichokes will have more
  tough outer leaves so more will have be removed than on younger or
  smaller artichokes. Immediately drop trimmed artichoke into the lemon
  water.
  
  Repeat process until all artichokes have been trimmed.
  
  Cook the artichokes in the lemon water for 3 to 5 minutes, depending
  upon size of artichoke hearts.  If mixed sizes are used, remove the
  small ones after 3 minutes.  Drain artichoke hearts and pack them
  tightly into 2 clean, dry, pint canning jars with sealable lids.  Add
  cup of vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon of salt to each jar.  Cover with the
  lids and let stand overnight.
  
  The next day, drain off and discard the vinegar.  Add 1 cup of
  vinegar to each jar.  Let jars stand 4 to 6 hours.  Drain off and
  discard vinegar. Add 1 garlic clove, 2 bay leaves, 1/4 teaspoon
  basil, 1/2 teaspoon oregano and 1 or 2 dried chiles (if desired) to
  each jar.  Fill to within 1/2 inch of the rims with olive oil.  Cover
  with the lids.
  
  At this point, the artichokes will keep up to 1 month stored in the
  refrigerator. alternately, they may be processed for 30 minutes in a
  canning kettle using the hot water process.  The sealed, canned
  artichoke hearts keep up to 1 year.
  
  Makes 2 pints.

      Title: Pickled Garlic (Kratiem Dong)
 Categories: Thai, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      1 c  White vinegar
      4 c  Water
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 tb Salt
      6    Garlic pods (approximately
           -120 cloves depending on
           -size), peeled
 
  Here's something that might appeal those of you engaged in the Garlic
  Thread.  It's not for everyone, but if you're a true garlic fan, these
  munchies might be right up your alley.  Thai garlic comes in pods
  that are about the same size as Western garlic but the cloves are
  about 1/3 to 1/2 the size of ours and there are correspondingly more
  in a head. The plus is that they don't have to be skinned before use.
  The emphasis here is on the sour rather than the sweet.  Quite a
  taste sensation. In a medium saucepan, bring the vinegar, water,
  sugar and salt to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Drop
  in the garlic.  Return to boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat.
  Cool, and fill sterilized, screw-top jars. Store in the refrigerator
  for at least 1 week before eating. Continue to refrigerate, tightly
  covered, between serving.

      Title: Plan Samli Daet Diao (Fried Sun-Dried Kingfish)
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Kingfish, weighing 1 to 1
           -1/2 lbs.
      1 tb Finely sliced shallot
      2 tb Shredded green mango
      1 ts Shredded hot chilli
      2 tb Fish sauce
      3 tb Lime juice
      1 ts Palm sugar
      2 c  Cooking oil
 
  Snagged an excellent new Thai cookbook yesterday.  It's "The Elegant
  Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon Kongpan and Pinyo
  Srisawat. SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989.  ISBN
  0-943389-05-4. This is a big, well-illustrated-with-color-photos
  book.  Mike hauled it home yesterday with another one, "Keo's Thai
  Cuisine".  (Being no dummy, he realizes that new cookbooks inspire me
  to cook so every so often he'll grab something for me to avoid having
  to cook himself.) But it wasn't that simple. He'd bought them both,
  but intended to keep one and send one on as a thank-you gift to a
  fella that took him and Laurie sailing a couple of weeks ago.
  
  "You get to choose one to keep." The dreaded words...
  
  I paled, started to shake.  Sweat beaded my brow.  I grabbed the
  fanciest one++the hardbound "Keo's" book++and paged through it, awed
  by the illustrations, impressed by the recipes.  Then I grabbed
  "Elegant Taste" and started on the first page, intending to skip
  through it. Instead I went through the entire book, page by page,
  from start to finish. I slammed it shut.  "This one."
  
  "Elegant Taste" explains Thai ingredients (and gives both the Thai
  names and spells them out using the Thai alphabet), makes sensible
  recommendations for substitutions and has relatively simple but very
  good and authentic looking recipes, each of which is illustrated by a
  beautiful color photo.  This can be really helpful when one is
  cooking a new dish and isn't sure of what it should look like and
  what garnishes to use. Garnishes are particularly important in Thai
  cooking as they're meant to be eaten with the dish but often are not
  referred to in the recipe. For instance, in the following recipe the
  dish is presented on a platter with a half dozen or so scallion
  brushes and tomato slices, neither of which are referred to in the
  recipe.
  
  As for this recipe, some of you might remember a while back when I was
  raving about a dried, fried fish dish I'd had in a Thai place, but
  couldn't find in a cookbook.  It was in "Elegant Taste" and here it
  is. Wash, clean and butterfly the fish leaving the two sides joined
  along the belly. Open the fish out flat so that the skin is downward,
  remove the bones, and score the flesh with a knife.
  
  After allowing it to dry, lay the fish opened out flat in strong
  sunshine for five to six hours, turning regularly so the sun strikes
  both the skin side and the interior.
  
  Pour the oil into a deep frying pan and place on medium heat.  When
  the oil is hot, place the fish, still opened out, in the oil.  When
  the lower side becomes crisp and golden, turn the fish and continue
  frying until it is done on both sides; then, remove from the pan,
  drain, place on a serving dish.
  
  Toss the shallots, mango and chilli together, seasoning with fish
  sauce, lime juice and palm sugar so that a sour taste is the
  predominant one. Spoon into a bowl and serve with the fish.
  
  Serves two to three.
  
  From "The Elegant Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon
  Kongpan and Pinyo Srisawat.  SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989.
  ISBN 0- 943389-05-4.
  
  This dish is very savoury with a crunchy/chewy texture.  The version
  I had in the restaurant still had bones but was so well fried that I
  just munched up the bones and all.
  
  Incidentally, I'm going to buy the "Keo's" book as well.  It looks
  quite good too but seems to be tailored more toward Western kitchens.
  For instance, it calls for brown sugar rather than palm sugar in most
  recipes. Now that's a perfectly adequate substitution, but why bother
  when I have palm sugar on hand?  (Smug grin.)

      Title: Poached Eggs with Chipotle Sauce
 Categories: Mexican, Eggs, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    To 2 dried chipotles or
           -mora chiles
    1/4 c  Water or chicken stock
      2 tb Shallots, minced
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Flour
    1/2 ts Dried sage
      1 ts Dried thyme
  1 2/3 c  Chicken broth
    1/2 c  Cream
           Salt to taste
     12    Eggs
           Pan de Maiz (see recipe)
 
  This sounds like a dandy brunch item.  Chipotle peppers are *very*
  hot, so be warned...
  
  Before you begin preparing everything else, pour boiling water over
  chipotle or mora chiles.  Cover and let soak for at least 1 hour. When
  chiles are well softened, puree them in a food processor with 1/4 cup
  w or chicken broth.
  
  Meanwhile, saute shallots in olive oil until softened.  Then add
  flour and cook until lightly brown.  Stir in the herbs and slowly
  whisk in the chicken broth.  Simmer for 5 minutes and then add the
  cream.
  
  Simmer sauce for 15 minutes or until slightly reduced.  Cream will
  thicken. Add 2 teaspoons of the chipotle puree and simmer for 5
  minutes longer to concentrate flavors.  If you want more chipotle
  flavor, you may add more puree at this point.  Be careful, it's
  picante.  Taste, and add salt, if necessary.
  
  Poach or lightly fry the eggs.
  
  Cut corn bread into 6 large squares.  Put a square on each plate.
  Place cooked eggs on top of corn bread and ladle on about 1/3 cup of
  Chipotle Sauce per serving.
  
  These eggs are great accompanied by black beans, turkey sausages and a
  fresh fruit compote to cool down the palate.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  Reserve leftover chipotle puree for another recipe.  Or blend
  with olive mayonnaise and dash of lime juice and use as a sandwich
  spread.

 Categories: Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
    1/2 lb Beef liver, in one thin cut
           Salt
           Pepper
           Flour for dredging
      2 tb Cooking oil (preferably
           -peanut, corn, or sunflower)
      2 tb Butter
      2    Green onions', minced
      1    Clove garlic, minced
  1 1/2 md Onions, sliced
  1 1/2 ts Flour
  1 1/2 c  Beef broth
    3/4 ts Kitchen Bouquet (seasoning
           -sauce)
 
  Even if you hate liver and onions, you'll find this tender, soulful
  version a revelation.  If you like liver and onions, you're about to
  see star bursts.  This recipe is based on a dish by brilliant chef
  Pookie Turner.
  
  1.  Season liver with salt and pepper, to taste.  Dredge lightly in
  flour.
  
  2.  Heat lightly oiled heavy skillet over high heat until fragrant,
  about 1 minute.  Add liver and fry until lightly browned, about 1
  minute per side. Remove liver and reserve.
  
  3.  Clean skillet and return it to stove over medium heat until dry.
  Add butter, and heat until it is melted.  Add green onions, garlic,
  and onions; fry, stirring, until onion is translucent (about 6
  minutes).
  
  4.  Sprinkle the 1 1/2 teaspoons flour over mixture and cook briefly,
  until the flour turns golden and loses its raw aroma (about 1
  minute); do not let flour brown.  Stir in broth, Kitchen Bouquet, 1/2
  teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Turn heat to medium-high and
  bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, until liquid thickens slightly,
  about 6 minutes. Adjust seasoning, if necessary.
  
  5.  Return liver to pan and cook on both sides for 30 seconds each (if
  liver is thick, cook for 90 seconds per side.) Remove from heat and
  serve immediately with boiled rice.
  
  Serves 2.

      Title: Pork and Chicken Wing Adobo with Spinach
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Chicken wings
  1 1/2 lb Boneless pork
    3/4 c  Palm vinegar, distilled
           -white vinegar or cider
           -vinegar
      3 tb Light soy sauce
      6    To 8 garlic cloves, peeled
      2    Shallots, chopped
      1 ts Coarsely ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Bay leaves
  1 1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
           Fresh spinach, blanched
           Hot cooked rice
 
  One of my all time favorite things to eat...
  
  There are many ways of preparing adobo.  In this recipe, the sauce is
  reduced to a rich savory glaze to coat the pork and chicken.
  
  Cut chicken wings between the joints.  Remove tips and save for
  stock. Trim fat from pork.  Cut meat into 1-inch cubes.
  
  Combine the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, shallots, pepper, salt and bay
  leaves in a non aluminum saucepan; add wings and pork, toss well to
  coat and let marinate for 1 to 3 hours.
  
  Add the water to the saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat and
  simmer for 20 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken and
  set aside. Let pork cook for 20 minutes longer.  Remove the pork.
  
  Reduce the sauce over high heat to about 1 cup; strain into a bowl.
  Spoon off fat.
  
  Heat the oil in a skillet; add chicken and pork and saute until nicely
  browned.
  
  Heat the sauce, then combine with chicken and pork.  Serve hot on a
  bed of blanched spin- spinach and steamed rice.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

 Categories: Poultry, Stuffing, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 tb Butter or margarine
    500 g  Minced pork
      2 c  Sultanas
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
     10    Green (spring) onions,
           -chopped
      2    Onions, finely chopped
      1 c  Bread crumbs
           I cup parsley, chopped

      2 tb Fresh oregano, chopped
        g  Rind of 1 orange.
 
  The next four posts should come in handy on the next holiday when
  you're faced with yet another turkey to fix.  One is from the US, the
  rest are from other parts of the world.  The Argentine Creole
  Stuffing looks *very* interesting.  All these assume you know how to
  stuff and cook a turkey.
  
  Plump sweet sultanas marry well with turkey meat, the pork mince adds
  richness and moistness and the generous quantity of fresh herbs lifts
  this stuffing out of the ordinary.
  
  Melt butter and gently fry minced pork until it changes colour,
  pressing out lumps with a fork.  Add to the rest of the ingredients
  and mix well.

      Title: Portuguese Almond and Potato Cake
 Categories: Portugal, Cakes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 lg Baking potato, about 10
           -ounces
      1 c  Almonds, with skins
      2 ts Baking powder
      3 lg Eggs, separated
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened
      1 tb Brandy
    1/2 ts Almond extract
           Powdered sugar
           Marzipan "potatoes,"
           -optional (see recipe)
 
  Bake or microwave potato until soft.  Force pulp through a coarse
  sieve or potato ricer.  There should be 1 cup lightly packed.  Set
  aside to cool.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter sides of an 8 1/2-inch spring form pan,
  line base with a circle of baking parchment; butter the parchment.
  Using a nut mill, grind almonds to powder, stir in baking powder; set
  aside.
  
  Beat egg whites until they start to stiffen, sprinkle with half of the
  sugar, a little at a time, and continue beating until stiff and
  glossy.
  
  Beat butter with remaining sugar, then beat in egg yolks, brandy, and
  almond extract.  Using a large rubber spatula, fold in potato, ground
  almonds and egg whites.
  
  Spoon into prepared pan; bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until a tester
  comes out dry.  Let cool in pan for 10 minutes.
  
  Run a knife blade around edge before releasing sides of pan.  Place
  cake, on the base, on a rack and let cool completely.  Cake will sink
  slightly in the middle.  Reverse cake onto a plate, peel off paper
  and place right side up on a serving plate.  Dust with powdered sugar
  before serving.
  
  MARZIPAN "POTATOES":  You'll need 4 ounces marzipan or almond paste
  and powdered unsweetened cocoa.
  
  Pinch off pieces of marzipan and roll into elongated balls, each
  about the size of a large marble.  Make these slightly irregular,
  like tiny new potatoes.  Roll in cocoa to simulate brown potato skin.
  Cut several in half to show the white interior.  Arrange a little
  group on top of the cake, and place the rest in twos and threes
  around the edge of the plate.
  
  Serves 10.

      1 c  Demi-glace *
    1/2 c  Pitted Nicoise olives

MMMMM--------------------------THE LAMB-------------------------------
      2    Lamb racks, 8 chops each **

           Salt and black pepper
      1    Rosemary sprig, leaves
           -only, chopped
           * (or good quality lamb or
           -beef broth)
           ** chine bones and fat
           -removed
 
  Postrio's is a swank SF eatery.  I've never been there, but the place
  gets rave reviews.  This recipe is from chef Anne Gingrass.  The
  olive sauce in this lamb dish looks very interesting.  Might be a
  good choice for the festive season rushing upon us.
  
  The sauce:  Saute the garlic, shallots lots and peppercorns in 1
  tablespoon butter until lightly browned, Add the Madeira and red
  wine, rosemary and tomato.  Simmer until reduced by two-thirds,
  leaving about 1 cup total.
  
  Add the demi-glace and return to a boil.  Whisk in remaining butter a
  little at a time until it is incorporated.  If you wish a thicker,
  richer sauce, add more butter.  Strain sauce through a fine strainer,
  then transfer to a blender.  Add half the olives and puree until
  almost smooth. Roughly chop the remaining olives and add to the
  sauce.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside in a warm
  place until serving time.
  
  The lamb:  Rub racks well with olive oil and season with salt, pepper
  and rosemary.  Let come to room temperature.
  
  Heat a roasting pan or large saute pan until very hot.  Add a few
  drops oil and sear the lamb racks in it on all sides until brown.
  Place the racks bone side down in the hot pan and transfer to a 400F
  oven. Roast to medium rare, or to desired doneness, 10 to 20 minutes.
  
  Let lamb rest for 15 minutes, then slice into 8 chops per rack. Serve
  4 chops to a plate (nap napped with a bit of sauce) with garlic mashed
  potatoes and lightly cooked vegetables of your choice.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

 Categories: Pancakes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Russet potato, boiled in
           -its skin until tender
    1/8 ts Salt or to taste
           Freshly ground pepper, to
           -taste
      2 tb All purpose flour
      1    Egg
    1/4 c  Plus 1 tablespoon milk
      1 tb Oil
 
  Here's a recipe that looks elegant enough for "Gourmet".  I'm posting
  it here in "Cooking" as well. I'd call it "California Cuisine" as it
  uses non-Oriental ingredients with both Chinese and European cooking
  techniques. The potato crepes are fancy potato pancakes while the
  seafood is prepared by poaching in low temperature oil, then
  stir-frying++a Chinese technique. The author, Jay Harlow, says: "This
  cooking method, in which the seafood is cooked first by a kind of low
  temperature deep-frying, is a typical Chinese technique.  It may
  appear to use a lot of oil, but most of it is drained away and can be
  reused for other frying. The over all amount of oil remaining in the
  dish is no more than with other stir-fried dishes." Peel the potato
  and put it through a food mill or ricer.  Season to taste with salt
  and pepper.  Stir in the flour.  Beat the egg and milk together, add
  to the potato mixture, and stir until smooth. Heat half the oil in a
  10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pout in half the potato
  mixture, shaping it into a thick pancake, 8 to 9 inches in diameter.
  Cook until well-browned, 2 to 3 minutes, turn and cook on the other
  side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with
  remaining oil and batter. Makes 2 crepes. From the San Francisco
  Chronicle, 2/13/91. Posted by Stephen Ceideburg; March 7 1991.

      Title: Potato Crepes with Scallops, Salmon and Asparagus
 Categories: Pancakes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
    1/2 lb Fresh asparagus
      1 tb Dry white wine
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
      1    Egg white
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/4 lb Scallops
    1/4 lb Salmon filet
           Potato crepes (see recipe)
  1 1/2 c  Peanut oil
      1 ts Minced fresh ginger
      1 tb Minced green onion
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 ts Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Rice vinegar
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Cornstarch dissolved in 1
           -teaspoon water
 
  Starting at the tip end, cut the asparagus into 1 1/2-inch lengths
  with a diagonal rolling cut:  slice off the tip at an angle, roll the
  asparagus about a quarter turn and cut again, and repeat on down the
  stalk until you reach the tougher base.  Discard the bases.  Dissolve
  the cornstarch in the wine in a medium bowl; add the egg white and
  pepper and beat lightly. Remove the tough white muscle from the edge
  of each scallop and cut the scallops into 1/4-inch-thick discs.
  Remove any pin bones from the salmon and slice across the width of
  the slice (parallel to the backbone) into 1/4-inch-thick rectangles.
  Add the salmon and scallops to the egg mixture and toss gently to
  coat. Preheat the oven to 175F and set 2 dinner plates in it to warm.
  Prepare the Potato Crepes and place 1 on each plate. Keep warm in the
  oven. Have a clean, dry, heatproof container, such as a saucepan, on
  the stove with a heat proof sieve on top. Drain the scallops and
  salmon and discard the marinade. Heat a wok or deep skillet over high
  heat. When it begins to smoke, add the oil. Wait 30 seconds, then add
  the seafood (the oil will not be very hot yet; this is intentional).
  Cook, stirring gently to separate the pieces, until salmon has lost
  its raw color.  Pour the contents of the wok into the sieve. Return
  the wok to the heat, and in the bit of oil clinging to the pan,
  stir-fry the ginger and green onion until fragrant.  Add the pepper
  and asparagus and stir-fry until it begins to brown.  Add the chicken
  stock, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar.  Cover, and cook until the
  asparagus is crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes depending on size.  Remove
  the cover, return the seafood to the wok, and stir in the cornstarch
  mixture.  Cook until the sauce is slightly thickened.  Taste for
  seasoning and adjust if necessary, then divide the seafood, asparagus
  and sauce over the potato crepes. Serve immediately Serves 2. From
  the San Francisco Chronicle, 2/13/91. Note that the potato pancakes
  require the potatoes to be cooked and cooled ahead of time, which can
  be done earlier in the day or the night before. Posted by Stephen

      Title: Poulet a la Montrachet (Chicken & Mushrooms in Cream Sauc
 Categories: French, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Free-range chicken (2 kg [4
           -lb])
    225 g  (8 oz) small spring carrots
    225 g  (8 oz) small onions
           -(pickling size)
    225 g  (8 oz) button mushrooms
     25 g  (I oz) butter
      1    Long branch tarragon or 1
           -sprig each thyme,
           -rosemary, parsley
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt, black pepper
    150 ml (1/4 pint) white burgundy
      2 lg Egg yolks
    300 ml (1/2 pint) double cream
 
  I made this one last night and was quite pleased with it, though the
  sauce turned out a bit thin.  I probably didn't cook the sauce long
  enough but I was afraid of curdling it, something I've been quite
  good at lately. BTW, I couldn't find any white burgundy so I used
  white Zinfandel instead.
  
  Wipe the chicken inside and out with a cloth wrung out in boiling
  water. Cut into 10 serving pieces:  2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings
  and 2 breasts halved.  Scrape the carrots and peel the onions.  Wipe
  the mushrooms with a damp cloth and trim the stalks.  Melt the butter
  in a heavy iron cocotte [heavy frying pan or Dutch oven.  S.C.] over
  low heat and when foaming add the pieces of chicken, the carrots and
  onions, and the herbs tied together. Season with salt and pepper, add
  the wine, cover and cook for 30 minutes, moving the ingredients
  around occasionally to prevent colouring. When the carrots and onions
  are tender remove them with a slotted spoon, cover and keep hot over
  a pan of boiling water.
  
  Slice the mushrooms finely, add to the pan, sprinkle with salt, cover
  and simmer for a further 20 minutes.  Beat the egg yolks into the
  cream and set aside.
  
  Remove the chicken from the pan to a heated serving dish, place the
  vegetables around it in small groups, cover with foil and keep hot.
  Using the back of a fork, work the meat residue from the bottom of
  the pan into the cooking juices.  Bring to boiling point, remove the
  herbs, and draw the pan from the heat.  Add a tablespoon of pan
  juices to the cream, stir well and return this mixture to the pan,
  stirring constantly until thick. Pour immediately over the chicken
  and serve without delay.
  
  The excellent sauce of this dish is best appreciated when accompanied
  by plain noodles or boiled rice.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      1 lb Unsalted buffer (460g)
      3 c  Powdered sugar (300g)
      3 c  All purpose flour (300g)
      6    Eggs
      1 ts EACH vanilla, almond extract
    1/2 c  Brandy (80ml)
        pn Of salt

MMMMM------------------------LEMON CREAM-----------------------------
    1/2 ts Saffron threads
    1/3 c  Sugar (65g)
    1/4 c  Lemon juice (60ml)
      2    Eggs
      4 tb Butter, in pieces
        g  Zest of one lemon
 
  There are many historical references to saffron cordials made by
  prolonged steeping of the spice in brandy and other alcohol.  I have
  been making this brandy cake for years and decided to try it with
  saffron.  It did not work; the saffron did not come through at all.
  My tasters loved the cake, however, and suggested the saffron go in
  some kind of icing instead. Great suggestion.
  
  Cream butter and sugar, then add eggs, one at a time.  Sift flour and
  add it gradually.  Add remaining ingredients, mix just until
  combined. Preheat oven to 375F (190C).  Bake in a greased and floured
  bundt or ring pan for about 50 minutes.  Cool in pan for 10 minutes,
  then on cooling rack.
  
  LEMON CREAM:
  
  Steep saffron in lemon juice for 20 minutes.  Whisk eggs and sugar,
  then add juice.  Switch to non-wooden utensil and cook cream in top
  of double boiler until thick.  Incorporate butter and cool before
  using.

  This simple Indian curry is a good example of green mango use. To 50 g
  desiccated coconut add just enough boiling water to moisten, stir and
  set aside (or use 70 g fresh coconut).  Peel 800 g green prawns and
  devein them.  Peel two green mangoes and cut the flesh into 2 cm
  cubes.
  
  Into the bowl of a food processor put 3 birdseye chillies (or less to
  taste), a tablespoon of ground coriander and the coconut.  Process to
  a paste.
  
  Peel and slice 2 onions.  Chop half a bunch of fresh coriander. In a
  saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil and fry the onions gently until
  they are transparent.  Add 2 or 3 fresh or dried curry leaves and the
  coconut paste and continue frying over a low heat, stirring
  occasionally, for about 10 minutes.  Add 500 mL water. salt to taste,
  half a tablespoon of turmeric, the mango and simmer for 10 minutes.
  Add half a cup of thick coconut milk and the prawns and cook for a
  further few minutes, just until the prawns turn pink.
  
  Remove to a serving dish, scatter the chopped coriander leaves over
  the top an serve with rice.
  
  Makes 4 to 5 servings.

      Title: Prawns in Spice Laden Coconut Sauce
 Categories: Indian, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     14 oz Canned coconut milk
      8    Dried, red chile peppers *
      2 ts Cumin seeds
      2 ts Coriander seeds
      1 ts Turmeric
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
      6    Garlic cloves, minced
      5 tb Peanut oil
      1 lg Onion, thinly sliced
           Salt
      1 lb Prawns, shelled, deveined
 
  * seeded or partially seeded (reduce or increase amount for a milder
  or spicier flavor)
  
  Do yourself a favor and use canned coconut milk in this recipe. It's
  a heck of a lot easier and probably better than what you would
  produce using a fresh coconut.
  
  Process the grated fresh coconut or the desiccated coconut with 3 1/2
  cups hot water in a food processor.  Drape a piece of folded
  cheesecloth over a bowl and pour the coconut mixture into the
  cheesecloth. Strain the liquid, squeezing the pulp to extract as much
  milk as possible. This is thick coconut milk; set aside.
  
  Pour 2 1/2 cups hot water over the coconut in the cheesecloth and
  squeeze to extract more milk into another bowl.  This second extract
  is thin coconut milk.  Set aside.
  
  If you are using canned coconut milk, skip this step and proceed with
  the recipe.
  
  Grind the chile peppers, cumin and coriander seeds in a spice grinder
  and set aside.
  
  Process the thick coconut milk (or canned coconut milk) with the
  ground spices, turmeric, ginger and garlic; set aside.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy, shallow pan.  Add the onions and cook until
  the edges begin to turn almost reddish brown (about 15 minutes),
  stirring frequently.  Add the coconut-spice mixture and cook until
  the liquid evaporates and oil separates from the paste.  Cook this
  paste for 10 more minutes, stirring constantly.
  
  Stir in the reserved thin coconut milk (or 2 cups water, if you have
  used canned coconut milk) and let simmer until reduced to a creamy
  sauce. Add salt to taste.
  
  Stir the prawns into the sauce and cook a few minutes until the
  prawns are just cooked.  (Be careful not to overcook).  Serve with
  steamed rice.
  
  Grated fresh coconut:  Pierce the eyes of a fresh coconut and drain
  off the liquid.  Put the coconut in a preheated 375F oven for 20
  minutes. Break it open with a hammer and separate the meat from the
  hard shell in large pieces.  Break the pieces into smaller ones and,
  using a vegetable peeler, peel the brown skin off the meat.  Grate
  the coconut meat in a food processor.
  
  Desiccated coconut:  May be found in Indian or Chinese stores.

      Title: Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls
 Categories: Amish, Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 12 servings
 
    1/3 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Canned pumpkin or mashed
           -cooked pumpkin
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg, beaten,
      1    Package dry yeast
      1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      1 c  Bread flour
    1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed
      1    Top. ground cinnamon
      2 tb Melted butter
 
  Here's an Amish recipe that might come in handy if you got a bunch of
  punkin' stuff laying around.  The date on this is 10/12/88.  That's
  right++'88!  I've had this pile of papers for a *long* time...
  
  In small saucepan, heat milk and 2 Tbs. butter just until warm (120F
  to 130F) and butter is almost melted, stirring constantly.
  
  In large mixer bowl, combine pumpkin, sugar and salt.  Add milk
  mixture and beat with electric mixer until well mixed.  Beat in egg
  and yeast.
  
  In separate mixing bowl, combine flours.  Add half of flour mixture to
  pumpkin mixture.  Beat mixture on low speed for 5 minutes, scraping
  sides of bowl frequently.  Add remaining flour and mix thoroughly
  (dough will be very soft).  Turn into lightly greased bowl then
  grease surface of dough lightly.  Cover and let rise in warm place
  until doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch dough down.  Turn onto floured surface.  Knead a few turns to
  form a smooth dough, sprinkling with enough additional flour to make
  dough easy to handle.  On lightly floured surface, roll dough into
  12- by 10-inch rectangle.
  
  In small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon.  Brush surface of
  dough with melted butter.  Sprinkle with brown sugar mixture.
  Beginning with long side of dough, roll up jelly-roll style.  Pinch
  seam to seal.
  
  With sharp knife, cut roll into twelve 1-inch slices.  Place rolls,
  cut side up, in greased 9-inch square baking pan.  Cover and let rise
  until nearly doubled, 30 to 45 minutes,
  
  Bake rolls at 350F for about 20 minutes or until golden.
  
  Remove from pan to waxed paper-lined wire rack.  Cool for 10 to 15
  minutes.
  
  Makes 12 rolls.

      Title: Pumpkin Empanadas
 Categories: Mexican, Pies, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 14 pies
 
      2 c  Unbleached white flour
      2 tb Sugar
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Shortening
    1/4 c  Cold sweet butter
      1 tb Brandy
      3 tb Milk
     16 oz Canned pumpkin puree
    3/4 c  Brown sugar
      2 ts Cinnamon, or 2 teaspoons
           -minced wild anise leaves
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
      1    Egg
      2 ts Pure vanilla
      1    Egg beaten with 1
           -tablespoon water for glaze
      2 tb Sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon
           -cinnamon
 
  Thanksgiving day, I whipped up the following in lieu of the
  traditional pumpkin (ho-hum) pie.  Both the crust and the filling are
  excellent. The flavors are a bit richer and more interesting than the
  traditional punkin' pie (at least my punkin' pie).  The only problem
  that I encountered was that the dough was a bit hard to handle++it
  tended to tear and was a bit hard to roll out thin.  That may be
  because instead of chilling it for a half-hour like the recipe says,
  I put it in the fridge and forgot about it for two and a half hours!
  It seemed to get easier to handle as it warmed up.  Also, instead of
  making the dough by hand, I used my food processor and it turned out
  just fine.  Just don't over process the dough if you do it that way
  
  These remind me of Mexican Dim-Sum.  In fact I'm sure that they'd be
  good with meat fillings too++say, curried pork or beef and onions
  (without the final sprinkling of cinnamon sugar though).
  
  Sift together first 4 ingredients.  Cut in the shortening and butter
  using a pastry blender or 2 knives.  The mixture should resemble
  coarse meal.
  
  Combine brandy and milk, and drizzle over flour mixture, stirring
  with a fork to distribute.  Do not over-blend.
  
  Form into a flat disc and wrap in plastic wrap.  Chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 400F.
  
  To make the filling, blend together the pumpkin, brown sugar, spices,
  egg and vanilla.
  
  When dough is chilled, roll out thinly on a floured board or pastry
  cloth. Cut into 4- or 5-inch circles.  Place about 2 tablespoons
  pumpkin filling on the lower half of each dough circle.  Fold over
  top half. Press the edges together with a fork.  Brush tops with egg
  wash and place on a baking sheet.  Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or
  until golden.
  
  While still warm, sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.  These may be
  baked 1 day ahead.  Before serving, warm in a 350F oven for 8
  minutes. Makes 14 to 16 empanadas. Pumpkin Empanadas (Jacqueline
  Higuera McMahan)
  
  When Grandmama made these little pies she included anise, which grew
  wild around our rancho.

      Title: Quail Breasts and Truffle Salad
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Herb vinaigrette (see below)
           Truffle juice vinaigrette
           -(see below)
     32    Asparagus tips
     50 g  Chanterelles   (cleaned)
     12 qt Breasts
      1    Or 2 uncooked yellow
           -zucchini (sliced into 48
           -very thin circles)
      1 lg Tomato (brunoised)
     15 g  Frisee lettuce (cleaned)
     12    Italian parsley leaves
     30 g  Truffle (sliced into 12
           -very thin circles)
           Butter
           Seasoning - salt, pepper,
           -chicken stock
           White wine
 
  The remaining recipes are Western and somewhat Frenchified to my eyes.
  They're "nouveaux" at the very least.  Little dabs of food artfully
  arranged here and there on a plate, sometimes connected by skeins of
  sauces.  Expensive too.  This one calls for chanterelles and 30 grams
  of truffles, a little over an ounce.
  
  Establishment: The Regent Hotel (Hong Kong) Salisbury Road,
  Tsimshatsui, Kowloon. Western Cuisine Practical Class Gold Award -
  Hors d'oeuvre Chef: Patrick Lin (The Regent Hotel)
  
  To prepare: 1. Make herb vinaigrette from onion, chives, Italian
  parsley, parsley and a pinch of tarragon, all finely chopped
  together.  (Keep some chopped herbs aside to use in chanterelles
  preparation - see below.) Add salt, pepper, walnut oil, sherry and
  vinegar, according to taste.
  
  2.  Make truffle juice vinaigrette from bottled truffle juice, salt,
  olive oil and vinegar.  (For both vinaigrettes recommended ratio of
  oil to vinegar is 2:1.)
  
  3.  Cut asparagus tips off stems with slanting cuts (so that they will
  stand up at an angle in central garnish.)
  
  To cook: 1. Lightly salt chanterelles and saute over a low flame in
  butter, with a drop of white wine, a few drops of chicken stock, and
  a mixture of the same herbs that were used to make herb vinaigrette
  (see above).
  
  2.  Reduce sauteed mixture completely, and then marinate chanterelles
  in herb vinaigrette for 30 minutes.
  
  3.  Clean quail breasts and season with salt and pepper.  In a
  restaurant kitchen they would be grilled - for home cooking, pan-fry
  in hot melted butter quickly for about one minute top and bottom
  until they are golden brown all over.
  
  To present: 1. Create central garnish by arranging a wheel of eleven
  overlapping yellow zucchini slices, placing a small heap of tomato
  brunoise on one central slice.  Place asparagus tips pointing
  outwards from centre.
  
  2.  Create three distinct islands of chanterelles topped with frisee
  lettuce and Italian parsley.  Place three truffle slices between
  chanterelle islands and lay one quail breast on each.  Pour a little
  truffle juice vinaigrette over quails and central garnish, and a
  little herb vinaigrette over lettuce.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: Queen Ida's Roux
 Categories: Cajun, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Oil
      2 c  Flour
 
  Here's a little something for when you get tired of all that
  disgusting smoked salmon...  Had a real treat in the food section
  from the SF Chron last Wednesday.  There was a big article on Queen
  Ida along with her recipe for gumbo.  She has a cookbook out++how
  that escaped me I have no idea. It's called "Cookin' With Queen Ida".
  
  Once roux has started to color, never leave the stove:  ignore
  telephones, doorbells, children and the pets, and keep stirring.  If
  a roux burns (it will develop a burned smell and blackened patches),
  throw it out and start over.  Roux can't be rushed, it's a gradual
  process and needs patience. When cooked too rapidly, roux may brown
  but it won't develop its characteristic flavor.  When roux is done,
  it will smell like well-cooked flour; it may taste and smell slightly
  bitter when sampled 'as is', but this doesn't mean it is burned.
  
  Mix oil and flour in a heavy cast-iron skillet.  Do NOT use a
  nonstick-coated pan.  If mixture is not as soft as pancake batter,
  add more oil.
  
  Cook over low to medium heat, stirring gently but constantly with a
  wooden spoon, scraping roux from bottom and sides of skillet.  If any
  lumps develop, whisk with a wire whisk until they break up.  Cook
  until the color is almost a mahogany or chile powder red-brown.  This
  will take from 30 to 60 minutes, depending on your pan and heat of
  your stove.  Be patient.
  
  After the roux is done, remove from heat to cool, but keep stirring
  constantly for the first few minutes.  Then stir frequently for 10
  minutes longer, since roux will continue to cook from its own heat
  for a few minutes.  As the roux cools, some of the oil will float to
  the top. Spoon it off.
  
  Turn roux into a container, and store in the refrigerator.  Before
  using, skim off any oil that has separated out, and let roux come to
  room temperature.
  
  NOTE:  If you do a lot of Creole cooking, you can double or triple the
  recipe.  It will take longer to cook, of course.

      Title: Queen Ida's Chicken and Sausage Gumbo
 Categories: Cajun, Gumbo, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 5 servings
 
     48 oz Chicken broth
  6 1/2 c  Water (see note)
  3 1/2    Chicken *
           Stalks of 1 bunch parsley,
           -chopped
    1/4 md Yellow onion
      1 tb Salt, or to taste
      1 tb Cayenne
  1 1/2 ts Black pepper
           Oil
      1 c  To 1 1/4 cups roux, at room
           -temperature
  1 1/2 lb Smoked sausages or smoked
           -links **
      1 c  Chopped parley leaves
    3/4 c  Chopped green onions
    1/2 c  Chopped celery
           About 1 1/2 teaspoons file
           -powder
           Cooked rice (about 8 cups)
 
  * cut into serving pieces, with neck and upper back separated **
  (spicy or mild), cut into 1/2-inch slices
  
  The amount of roux needed to thicken this gumbo will vary with the
  type of chicken used, since some of the liquid will evaporate during
  the long cooking needed with a stewing hen or a large roaster.  If
  using small frier pieces that cook quickly, use 1 1/4 cup roux; if
  using a larger or tougher chicken, use just 1 cup.  For the richest
  flavor, start the stock cooking first, and let it simmer while you
  measure and cut up the other ingredients.
  
  Bring chicken broth and the water to a boil in a large stockpot. Add
  the neck and back (and wingtips, heart, gizzard and feet, if
  desired), the parsley stalks and the yellow onion.  Return to a boil;
  skim, reduce heat, and simmer while preparing other ingredients.
  
  Mix together the salt, cayenne and black pepper, and season the
  remaining chicken pieces on both sides with the mixture (reserving
  any extra seasoning).
  
  Film a large skillet with oil and, over high heat, lightly saute the
  chicken pieces on both sides just until they begin to color.  (Or,
  you can broil chicken briefly, about 5 minutes per side, turning
  once.) Do not totally brown the chicken; cook it only long enough to
  tighten the meat and seal in the juices.  Reserve chicken pieces.
  (Add any juice from the bottom of the broiling pan to the stock.)
  
  Return stock to a boil, remove from heat and, stirring strongly,
  blend in a large spoonful of the room-temperature roux.  Return pot
  to low heat so the liquid bubbles gently but does not boil, and
  gradually stir in the remaining roux, a little at a time, until the
  liquid thickens slightly. This process will take 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  Add sausages and parley to the stock and simmer, uncovered, for 20 to
  30 minutes.
  
  Drop the chicken pieces carefully into the stock, add any reserved
  seasonings, and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30
  minutes.  Adjust heat to maintain a steady simmer; DO NOT BOIL.
  
  Add green onions and celery and continue to simmer until chicken is
  cooked through but not yet falling off the bone (about 15 minutes
  longer for a fryer, 1 hour longer if using a tough stewing hen).  As
  chicken simmers, tilt the pot and, using a large metal spoon, skim
  excess fat from the surface of the broth.  Taste carefully and
  correct seasonings if needed. Remove any chicken parts you don't want
  to serve (such as feet, neck, upper back).  [Do NOT remove if you're
  gonna serve it to ME... S.C.] If liquid has gotten too thick (it
  should not be as thick as a stew), stir in a little more broth or
  water and simmer briefly to blend flavors. Serve gumbo hot over a
  mound of rice.
  
  NOTE:  if there is no time to simmer the neck and back, replace water
  with a light (uncondensed) chicken broth.
  
  Serves 5 or 6.
  
  GUMBO FILE:
  
  Sprinkle about 1/4 teaspoon file power into each person's empty gumbo
  bowl, then spoon in the gumbo and rice and stir together.
  
  CHICKEN OKRA GUMBO:
  
  Wash 1 pound okra, trim off the heads and tough tails, and cut into
  1/4-inch slices.  Make gumbo as above, but decrease roux to 2/3 cup.
  Once the roux has been stirred into the liquid, add all the okra at
  once. (Gumbo liquid will suddenly become much thicker.) Proceed as
  above, cooking the gumbo for at least 45 minutes after adding the
  okra, or until okra is very tender.  Although gumbos combining both
  okra and file powder are rare, file powder may be sprinkled into the
  gumbo bowls if desired.

      Title: Quick Conversion Guide for Ozzie Measurements (Part 1)
 Categories: Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  I'm starting to post recipes from the excellent series of cookbooks
  put out by The Australian Women's Weekly.  If you have any interest
  in these recipes at all, save this post.  These are conversions from
  Ozzie to US and British measurements.
  
  QUICK CONVERSION GUIDE:
  
  Wherever you live in the world, you can use our recipes with the help
  of our easy-to-follow conversions for all your cooking needs.  These
  conversions are approximate only.  The difference between the exact
  and approximate conversions of liquid and dry measures amounts to
  only a teaspoon or two, and will not make any noticeable difference
  to your cooking results.
  
  MEASURING EQUIPMENT:
  
  The difference between measuring cups internationally is minimal
  within 2 or 3 teaspoons difference.  (For the record, 1 Australian
  measuring cup will hold approximately 250ml.) The most accurate way
  of measuring dry ingredients is to weigh them.  When measuring
  liquids use a clear glass or plastic jug with metric markings.
  
  1 Teaspoon: 5ml 1 Tablespoon: 20ml
  
  NOTE:  NZ, CANADA, USA AND UK ALL USE 15ml TABLESPOONS.  ALL CUP AND
  SPOON MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL.

      Title: Quick Turnip Pickles (Kabu No Sokuseki-Zuke)
 Categories: Japanese, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     12 md Turnips
      5    Heaping Tbs salt
      4    (10-cm) piece giant kelp
           -(konbu)
      1    (2 1/2-cm) square yuzu
           -citron or lemon rind
 
  An example of "instant" salt pickling.  It takes only an hour for
  these pickles to ripen, and they will keep, covered, in the
  refrigerator for the better part of a week.  Also appropriate for
  cucumber sliced in thin wafers.  Peel and seed large cucumbers.
  
  To prepare:  Cut off greens from turnips and reserve.  Wash turnips,
  peel, then cut into very fine julienne strips.  Wash greens, dry,
  then chop finely.
  
  Put turnip strips with finely chopped greens into a bowl and sprinkle
  with salt.  Table salt is fine.  Knead with your hands and mix
  thoroughly to draw water out of vegetable.  In less than a minute, a
  fair amount of liquid will be produced.  Discard this liquid.
  
  Add the konbu and a 1-inch (2 1/2-cm) square of yuzu citron or lemon
  rind. Let stand, lidded and with a light weight, for 1 hour at room
  temperature.
  
  To serve:  Pick out a portion from the bowl with chopsticks or fork
  and shake off liquid.  Arrange in a mound on individual pickle dish.
  You may season with a few drops of soy sauce, if desired.

  NOTE:  The "lidded and with a light weight" refers to making them in a
  Japanese pickle tub.  A plate with a small rock in a nonreactive pan
  will do.

    150 g  Dried jelly fish
      1    Red pepper
    1/4    Yam bean (optional), or
           -turnip
    2/3    Cucumber
    2/3    Celery stalk
    1/3    Carrot
      1 tb Sesame seeds
  1 1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      2 ts Sesame oil
 
  The following 12 recipes are from a booklet put out by the Hong Kong
  Tourist Association in celebration of the 1986 Hong Kong Food
  Festival. These are the winning chefs and their winning recipes.  The
  chefs are all ethnic Chinese from all over Asia, but the recipes
  really run the gamut, from traditional Chinese food to dishes like
  Shark's Fin Soup to things like "Lamb Fillets with Morels" which is
  Western in inspiration and presentation.
  
  Some of the recipes should have the caveat "Don't try this at home,
  kids", mainly because of the amount of preparation involved.  This
  first one, an appetizer plate consisting of 7 mini-courses, falls
  into that category. It's presented in one of those round, segmented
  lazy-susan type serving things.  Very striking.  Any one of these
  dishes would be suitable for a main course in a Chinese meal.
  
  Chef: Ng Wang-chau
  
  Twenty-eight old, Hong Kong-born Mr.  Ng has worked in three of Hong
  Kong's leading Sichuanese restaurants since he began his career 14
  years ago. Apart from creating this Award-winner, he is also renowned
  for his pan-fried spiny lobster.

  characters for dish name deleted. S.C.] Circle Game (12 servings)
  Chef.- Ng Wang-chau (Ziyang Szechuen Restaurant)
  
  The literal translation, "Turning Around Life", prompts a host
  meaningful connotations for this Sichuanese starter.  Seven
  mini-courses, composed of contrasting flavours, represent the varying
  moods, as well as the seven stages, of a person's life.  An
  alternative translation - "Life is a Merry-go round" - captures the
  spirit of the theme, and its presentation, so appropriately on a
  turntable.  Each of the individual dishes, which could be served
  separately or a few at a time, also have their own particular
  mythological and dietary connotations.
  
  1.  Soak jelly fish in very hot (but not boiling) water for
  approximately 3 minutes until it curls.  Then rinse under cold
  running water for approximately 1 hour until it expands.  Drain and
  cut into strips.
  
  2.  Shred vegetable ingredients, and blanch slightly in boiling
  water. Then rinse under cold running water until they are cold, and
  drain.
  
  3.  Stir-fry sesame seeds in a dry wok until they are golden.
  
  4.  Mix jelly fish and vegetables with salt, sugar and sesame oil.
  
  5.  Sprinkle sesame seeds over mixture.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 lb Dried red kidney beans
      2 c  Chopped yellow onions
      1 bn Of scallions, chopped
      3    Or 4 finely sliced cloves
           -of garlic
      1 bn Parsley (chopped)
      3 lb Smoked sausage *
           Salt and pepper to taste
      3 qt Of cold water
 
  * cut into 2 inch lengths (smoked ham or ham bone works fine)
  
  I just made no-fat refried beans last night completely by accident.
  
  I was making this recipe and discovered it in the process.
  
  Soak beans overnight if possible.  Drain water and add beans to a
  large 8- or 10-quart pot.  Then add enough of the cold water to cover
  the beans. Add chopped yellow onions and garlic and bring to a boil.
  Cook for one hour and add all the other things and more water if
  necessary.
  
  Simmer (slight bubbling action) for 2 more hours or until the beans
  are soft.  Then remove 2 cups of cooked beans without juice and mash
  very good. Then return the mashed up beans to the pot and stir into
  the mixture. This makes a creamy, thicker gravy.  If the beans are
  too dry, add enough water to make them like you like them.  Good over
  boiled rice.
  
  Serves 8.

  From "White Trash Cooking", Ernest Matthew Mickler.  Ten Speed Press,
  1986. ISBN 0-89815-189-9.
  
  When I got to the point where you take the two cups beans out and
  mash 'em, I put them in the food processor to puree.  They came out
  smelling and tasting just like refried beans.  The texture was a tad
  thin, but that could be remedied easily.  You could probably even
  "re- fry" them in a non-stick skillet to reduce the water content.  I
  used skin-on ham hocks to make this batch of beans, but you could
  easily leave that out and still come up with something close to what
  you want, I think.

      Title: Rich Chicken Stock
 Categories: Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  7 1/2 lb Whole chicken and parts,
           -such as backs, feet, wings
      6 qt Cold water
      8 sl Unpeeled fresh ginger
      8    Whole scallions, cut into
           -pieces
      2 ts Salt
 
  Stock is the foundation of all good cooking.  I emphasize this
  because it is so important a principle.  Good stock, especially
  chicken stock, is necessary for the cuisine of Hong Kong, whose
  subtle flavors, fresh ingredients, and fast cook cooking techniques
  require very good stock. Light, flavorful, and versatile chicken
  stock should be considered a staple, to set beside salt, cooking oil,
  or soy sauce.
  
  There are commercially prepared canned or cube stocks but many of
  them are of inferior quality, being either too salty or containing
  additives and colorings that adverse affect your health as well as
  the natural taste of good foods.  Make your own, it is the best.  You
  can make a big batch and freeze it for your own use when needed.  In
  making a good stock, here are a few rules to remember:
  
  * It is best to use about 50 percent bones and 50 percent meat.
  Without meat, the stock will not have the necessary body or richness
  or depth of flavor and will taste watery.  Stewing old hens is best
  if you can find them, because they are inexpensive and full of flavor.
  
  * Stock should simmer.  Never let the stock come to a boil because
  that will result in a cloudy and heavy stock.  Flavors and digest-
  ibility come with a clear stock.
  
  * Use a tall heavy pot so the liquid covers all the solids and
  evaporation is slow.
  
  * Simmer on low heat and gently skim the stock every now and then to
  remove any impurities.
  
  * Strain the stock slowly through several layers of cheese cloth or a
  fine mesh strainer.
  
  * Allow the stock to cool thoroughly before storing in the re-
  frigerator or freezer.
  
  If you make a habit of saving your uncooked chicken bones and
  carcasses, you will have the essential ingredients for stock in no
  time. It makes good economical sense also.
  
  The stock should be rich and full-bodied, which is why it needs to be
  simmered for such a long time.  This way the stock (and any soup you
  make with it) will have plenty of taste.  With a good, stock, you
  will also get good sauces for a true taste of Hong Kong!
  
  Cut up the chicken and put the pieces and parts together into a very
  large pot.  Cover them with the cold water and bring the stock to a
  simmer. Using a large, flat spoon, gently skim off the scum as it
  rises from the bones. Watch the heat as the stock should never, boil.
  Keep skimming until the stock looks clear.  This can take from 30 to
  40 minutes. Do not stir or disturb the stock.
  
  Turn the heat down to a low simmer and add the ginger, scallions, and
  salt. Simmer the stock on a very low heat for at least 3 hours,
  skimming any fat off the top at least twice during this time.  Strain
  the stock through several layers of dampened cheesecloth or through a
  very fine mesh strainer, and then let it cool thoroughly.  Remove any
  fat that has risen to the top.  It is now ready to be used or
  transferred to containers and frozen for future use.
  
  Makes 6 quarts.

    230 g  Currants
    230 g  Mixed peel
    230 g  Glace pineapple

    450 g  Plain flour
    115 g  Rice flour
      1 ts Parisian essence [Hunh?,
           -again... S.C.]
      2 tb Ultra-strong coffee.
 
  Everyone knows that there never was Christmas cake as good as the one
  Mum makes.  Well, here it is.  With surpassing generosity, Raw
  Materials' Mum gave permission for the family recipe, used down the
  years, to appear here, its imperial measures at last converted to
  metric. [Lucky us, eh... ;-} S.C.]
  
  Clean and prepare all fruit except the prunes.  Pick over vine fruit
  and remove any stems.  Chop the larger fruit into small pieces (a
  pair of scissors does the job more easily than a knife).  Mix the
  fruits in a bowl and add brandy and sherry.  Cover tightly and leave
  overnight or longer.
  
  Prepare one deep 23 cm square cake tin (or, for one cake to keep and
  one to give, one 20 cm square tin and one 15 cm square).  Grease the
  interior of the tin(s) with butter.  Line with two layers of brown
  paper cut to fit and to project above the sides of the tin by about 5
  cm.
  
  Inside the brown paper, fit a layer of grease proof paper, projecting
  similarly.  Butter the inside of the grease proof.  Pit and chop the
  prunes.  Cream the butter and sugar well.  Add the eggs, one at a
  time, mixing each in thoroughly.  Add prunes.
  
  Sift flours together and add the butter-sugar mixture alternately
  with the fruit.  Add the essence and coffee.
  
  Put the mixture into the prepared tins(s).  Dip one hand in cold
  water and pat the surface of the cake flat.  (The thin layer of water
  keeps the surface moist for a long time and lessens the chance of the
  cake rising in the middle.) Bake in a preheated 150C oven for 1 hour,
  then reduce the heat to 135C and cook for a further 2 1/4 hours.
  
  Take the cake from the oven and fold the extra paper layers over the
  top of the cake, tin and all, while still hot in at least 4 layers of
  newspaper. Place on a rack and leave overnight.  (This process keeps
  the cake moist and prevents it cracking on top while it cools.) In
  the morning, remove from the tin, peel off the paper and store the

      Title: Ricotta Con Le Fragole (Strawberries with Ricotta Cream)
 Categories: Italian, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Unlike most other cheeses, Italian ricotta is comparatively low in
  fat and has only 420 kilojoules per 100 g compared to cream's 1400.
  So this recipe for ricotta cream is an excellent and rich-tasting
  alternative to whipped cream.
  
  Hull 3 punnets of strawberries and put them in 1 large or 6 individual
  dishes.  Put 450 g ricotta cheese in a food processor and add 2 egg
  yolks, 2 tablespoons of rum, the grated zest of a lemon and 3
  tablespoons of honey or sugar.  Process, pour over the strawberries
  and chill until serving.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: Roast Duckling
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
  4 1/2 lb To 5 lb. duckling
           Chef's Salt (see below)
      1    Carrot, washed, scraped,
           -and coarsely chopped
      2    Stalks celery, coarsely
           -chopped
      1 md Onion, coarsely chopped
      1    Or 2 cloves garlic, thinly
           -sliced
      3    To 4 tbs. lard, duck fat,
           -or chicken fat
      3    To 4 black peppercorns
      1 sm Piece of bay leaf
           Sprinkling of marjoram
           CHEF'S SALT:
      1 c  Salt
      1 tb Spanish paprika
      1 ts Ground black pepper
    1/4 ts Ground white pepper
    1/4 ts Celery salt
    1/4 ts Garlic salt
 
  The following three recipes are from a book called "The Chef's Secret
  Cook Book" by a Hungarian psychologist turned chef named Louis
  Szathmary. Szathmary is more interested in good food that in culinary
  pomposity and that makes for some good reading.  At the end of each
  recipe is a "Chef's Secret" that explains exactly why the recipe
  recipe is prepared in the way it is.
  
  1.  Preheat the oven to 300F to 325F.
  
  2.  Use a roasting pan with a tight-fitting cover.  Put the lard,
  duck fat, or chicken fat into the roasting pan.  Reach into the vent
  end of the duckling and remove the neck and giblets, which will be
  inside the body cavity.  Rub the inside and outside of the duckling
  with Chef's Salt.
  
  3.  Place the duckling, breast down, directly on top of the lump of
  fat in the roasting pan.  Place the cut vegetables and garlic inside,
  on, and around the duckling.  Add about 1 to 2 inches of water to the
  pan. Add the peppercorns, bay leaf, and marjoram.  Cover and place in
  the preheated oven.
  
  4.  After 2 hours, take the roasting pan out of the oven and very
  carefully remove the duckling to a platter.  Let it cool completely.
  If it is not completely cooled, the dish will not turn out properly.
  
  5.  To finish, split the duckling lengthwise by standing it on the
  neck end and, with a sharp knife, cutting from the tip of the tail
  directly down the center.  To quarter, each half may again be cut.
  
  6.  Place the cold, split duckling pieces, cut side down and skin
  side up, on a slightly greased cookie sheet.  Return to a 425F to
  450F oven for 18 to 22 minutes.  Before serving, remove the first two
  joints of the wing, leaving only the third.
  
  CHEF'S SECRET:  The success of a roast duckling starts with the
  buying. For best results, buy the best.  A 4 1/2 to 5-lb. duckling is
  the most satisfactory and economical size.  It is perfectly safe and
  even advisable to buy frozen duckling.  Look for the mark of
  government inspection on the package.  Store in a freezer or the
  freezing compartment of the refrigerator until ready to use.  Before
  using, let the duckling defrost overnight in the bottom of the
  refrigerator.  After it has been defrosted completely and the flesh
  feels soft, preparation may begin.
  
  After the duckling has been removed from the roasting pan to cool, it
  can be safely kept at room temperature all day.  Or, if the weather
  is very hot and humid, store the duckling in the refrigerator after
  it has cooled to room temperature.  It is important to bring it back
  to room temperature about an hour before finishing.  Do not reheat
  right from the refrigerator.
  
  Perhaps you wonder why fat is added to the duck, which is a naturally
  fat bird.  As the water starts to beat in the roasting pan, the fat
  becomes liquid and forms an even surface over the top of the water.
  
  The surface of fat has a boiling point of 360F degrees, while the
  water boils at 212F.  Without the fat, the water would create a vapor
  surrounding the duck in the covered roasting pan.  This would give
  the bird a steam-cooked, undesirable taste, and would prevent the fat
  under the duck skin from oozing out as it does in dry air.
  
  Makes 2 to 4 servings.
  
  CHEF'S SALT"
  
  Mix well and use instead of salt.
  
  Be careful to use garlic salt, not garlic powder.  If you use garlic
  powder a small pinch is enough.

      Title: Roasted Marinated Crab
 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Live crab, 2 to 2 1/2 pounds
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Shredded ginger
      1 tb Chopped garlic
      2    Serrano or other small
           -green chiles, chopped
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2    To 4 tablespoons butter
           Salt to taste
 
  To kill the crab, either plunge it into a large pot of boiling water
  for a minute, or place it on its back on a cutting board and split
  the body down the middle with one quick cut with a heavy knife or
  Chinese cleaver. If you want to use the upper shell in the
  presentation, the first technique works better.
  
  Holding the crab body by the legs, pull off the shell.  Discard the
  feathery gills on both sides of the body and the spongy mass in the
  middle of the back; rinse until nothing but shell and meat show.
  Pull out the bits of greenish fat from the corners of the shell;
  reserve if desired for the sauce.  Rinse both the body and shell and
  drain thoroughly.
  
  Split the body of the crab (if it is not already split) into 2 halves
  with legs and claws still attached.  Carefully crack each leg and
  claw segment with a mallet.
  
  Place in a large bowl with the oil, ginger, garlic, chiles and a
  generous grinding of pepper.  Marinate for 1 to 4 hours in the
  refrigerator.
  
  Remove crab from marinade 15 minutes before cooking.  Grill the
  halves and the shell over a hot fire until outer shells are bright
  red and meat in the largest sections is opaque (pry one open to
  check), 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Or , place crab halves and shell in
  a roasting pan lightly oiled with a bit of the marinade and roast in
  a 450F oven until done as described above, about 12 to 15 minutes.
  Meanwhile, strain vegetables out of marinade and combine with the
  butter in a saucepan. Simmer for 5 minutes and season to taste.
  Serve in small bowls as a dipping sauce for the crab.
  
  Serves 2.

      8 c  Water
           Salt to taste
    1/4    Onion
    1/4 c  Olive oil
 
  Poach chicken with celery tops, onions and peppercorns.  Cook for
  about 15 minutes.  Let cool and remove skin.  When chicken is
  skinned, slice or shred, then saute with olive oil in wok or large

  yellow peppers and red onions. Toss and saute for about 10 minutes.
  Watch closely so that peppers don't go limp.  Add cilantro leaves.
  Remove from heat.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Combine with beans
  (see below).  Place in tortillas, top with salsa and serve.
  
  Cook beans in water for approximately 1 1/2 hours on medium heat.
  
  Make sure that beans are completely covered in water.  Stir

      Title: Rock Cornish Game Hens with Herb and Shallot Butter
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Rock Cornish game hens
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
      1 ts Rosemary
      1 ts Thyme
      2 tb Chopped parsley
    1/4 lb Butter
      5    Shallots (minced)
 
  Merle Ellis doesn't provide any more detail on the origins of the game
  hens, but he does note that "These delicious little birds didn't even
  exist back in the days when Grandma was a girl.  Their ancestors did,
  the Plymouth Rock hen and the Cornish game cock, but they hadn't
  gotten together yet in those days.  That event didn't happen till
  around 1950 and since then Rock Cornish Game Hens have become almost
  commonplace."
  
  Ah but all may not be as it seems at the old poultry counter!  While
  discussing the classification of poultry, Ellis states "Young
  chickens may be labeled young chicken, broiler, roaster, fryer capon
  or Rock Cornish game hen".  So I guess you pays yer money and takes
  your chances. Whatever it is that's hanging out around the poultry
  bins in Safeway under the guise of Rock Cornish game hens, they're
  good!
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Cut each hen in half, sprinkle all over with
  salt and pepper, and bring to room temperature.  Melt butter in small
  fry pan and add shallots, rosemary and thyme.  Stir well and let
  bubble for about 5 minutes, then remove from heat.  Place hens in
  flat baking pan, skin side up, and baste with the butter sauce. bake
  for 50 minutes, basting every 15 minutes.  Garnish with parsley.
  
  Serve with wild rice, leaf spinach, and a rose wine.

      Title: Rock Cornish Game Hen History
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Information
 
  I drew a blank on the subject until I remembered that I'd always
  heard of them referred to as Rock Cornish Game Hens rather than just
  Cornish Game Hens.  That's when I finally hit pay dirt.
  
  The following is from a book by the brothers Lobel all about meat and
  poultry.
  
  These delectable little birds were actually "invented".  It took a
  printer of exceptional engravings++with a taste for fine art and fine
  food++to dream up the idea.  Jacques Makowsky and his wife, Therese,
  came to America via Russia and France.  He practiced his art in New
  York City for eight years and then retired to a farm in Pomfret
  County, Connecticut. The wild beauty of his surroundings++plus his
  idleness++ caused him to call his farm Idle Wild.  He decided to
  become a poultry farmer, but only of gourmet birds.  He first raised
  Guineas, but later he and his wife, after much experimenting, came up
  with a crossbreed of Cornish game cocks and Plymouth Rock hens.  The
  result was a plump little bird with all-white meat.
  
  The first Rock Cornish game hen made its debut in 1950.  Now they
  sell in the millions and are shipped all over the country to gourmet
  restaurants and fine butcher shops.  Aside from the succulence of its
  white meat, it has a distinct gamy flavor.  This is because the birds
  are given a high protein diet that includes such native Connecticut
  produce as cranberries, acorns, and other nuts.  It is sometimes
  compared in appearance and taste with the less available quail and
  squab.
  
  The usual weight is 1 pound, which is ample for an individual
  serving. In fact, half a bird is adequate for home parties++if the
  rest of the menu is abundant.

      Title: Rujak (Pungent Fruit Salad)
 Categories: Sumatra, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Cucumber, peeled
      1 c  Jicama, julienned
      1 c  Firm, ripe papaya in 1/2
           -inch cubes
      1 c  Ripe pineapple in 1/2 inch
           -cubes, fresh or canned
      1    Firm, tart apple, cut in
           -1/2-inch cubes
      1    Almost ripe mango, peeled,
           -cubed
      3 tb Dry-roasted peanuts
      1    Or 2 fresh, hot red chiles,
           -seeded, sliced
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 tb Tamarind paste dissolved in
           -1/2 cup water, strained
 
  Buried way down in my stack of papers I found an article from the SF
  Chron entitled "Sumatran Food++Hotter than Hot".  Sumatra is close to
  Indonesia and the Malay peninsula and there seems to be some
  similarity between the cuisines.
  
  Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise, scoop out and discard the seeds.
  Cut the halves in 1/4-inch thick half moons.  Mix the cucumber with
  jicama and fruit.
  
  Prepare a sauce in a processor; first process the peanuts to a crunchy
  consistency, then add the chiles, sugar and tamarind liquid.  The
  sauce should have texture so don' over process.  Toss the sauce and
  fruit together.
  
  Serve chilled or at room temperature as a snack, or with an
  assortment of Sumatra dishes.
  
  Serves 6.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  If this thread has you drooling at the mere thought of saffron, here's
  where you can get it.
  
  Listed below are resources which will be helpful if you do not
  already have a good connection with a purveyor of the spice, the
  corms and recipes.
  
  My saffron purveyor for the last three years is listed.  I have
  bought many brands in addition to the ones he supplies for comparison
  and have found some comparable in quality but never in price or
  airtight packaging. You need to buy a minimum of 1/2 ounce from him.
  
  A source for liquid saffron, the only one available as far as I know,
  is also listed.  Actually this is saffron extract, not liquid saffron
  in that the threads have been steeped in alcohol and water for a
  month. There is an obvious advantage in measuring but make sure you
  use the extract only when you are cooking or baking.  For me the
  alcohol taste is too strong otherwise (for example in a mayonnaise).
  
  ANTIQUARIAN AND OUT-OF-PRINT COOKBOOKS:
  
  Thousands of cookbooks are available with saffron recipes but some of
  the more interesting ones are hard to find.  Jim Garrett, owner of
  Buchmann, specializes in searches for older titles and found many of
  my references.

  SAFFRON SWEET BREADS:
  
  They were out the day I went to investigate but the saffron baked
  goods sound delicious:  yeast baby loaves or cupcakes filled with
  dried fruit and nuts.  The owner is an Englishman, a famous inventor
  (first automatic doughnut machine, a pastie machine) who loves
  saffron and is still working at age 100.  In this part of California
  saffron breads, cupcakes and cookies used to be available in every
  family-owned bakery because the Cornish miners created a demand for
  them.  Several grandchildren wistfully recounted memories for me of
  such wonders from grandmothers' kitchens.

      Title: Salmon in Pesto Sauce
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      3 tb Lemon juice
      3 tb Rice vinegar
      3 tb Light soy sauce
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Crushed Sichuan peppercorns
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black popper
      1 tb Dry Sherry
      1 tb Sesame oil
      2 tb Minced fresh ginger root
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1 lb Salmon fillet, in I or 2
           -pieces
      1 tb Cornstarch
      2    Cloves garlic, peeled and
           -minced
      2 tb Minced scallions
      1 tb Minced cilantro
 
  Check this one out.  It has "pesto" in the title, but has no basil in
  it and is a Chinese recipe.  Hmmm...
  
  In a small bowl, combine lemon juice, rice vinegar, 2 Tbs. light soy
  sauce, sugar, salt, Sichuan peppercorns and black pepper.  Set aside.
  In a separate bowl, combine remaining I Tbs. soy sauce, Sherry,
  sesame oil and 1 Tbs. ginger.  Rub fish with mixture and marinate for
  at least 20 minutes. (This can be done several hours in advance.)
  
  Fill a large pan with water and bring to rapid boil.  Meanwhile,
  place a layer of foil in a Chinese steamer tray, covering tray except
  for 1 inch around edges to allow steam to circulate.  Rub foil with a
  little peanut oil.  Lay salmon on foil in tray and place tray over
  boiling water. Cover and steam salmon until light pink, just firm to
  touch and flakes when tested with fork.  (A 1/2-inch-thick fillet
  should take about 5 minutes.)
  
  In a small bowl, combine cornstarch with 1 Tbs. cold water. Place a
  10-inch saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add 1 Tbs. peanut oil. When
  hot, add remaining ginger and garlic.  Saute for 15 seconds, then add
  lemon juice mixture.  Bring to slow boil, stir in scallions and
  cilantro, then stir in small amount cornstarch mixture to lightly
  thicken sauce. Remove from heat.
  
  When salmon is cooked, remove steamer tray and lift fish out on foil.
  Slide fish onto platter or dinner plates.  Spoon sauce over fish.
  Serve at once.
  
  Serves 2 as a main course, 6 as part of a multi-course Asian dinner.
  
  NOTE:  Salmon is excellent served at room temperature or eaten cold
  while you stand in front of the refrigerator.  The pesto sauce is
  good on any steamed, baked, broiled, or grilled firm-fleshed fish
  fillet.

 Categories: Portugal, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Vinegar
      4 c  Water
      2 ts Cinnamon
      4 ts Ground cumin seed
      6 lg Cloves of garlic, mashed
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Mix all of the ingredients in a large kettle and stir well.  Add
  salmon slices and stir well so each slice will absorb the spices and
  garlic. Leave in brine over night, but not longer than 24 hours, as
  salmon tends to get mushy.  Remove from brine, roll in cracker crumbs
  or meal and fry in hot oil.  This recipe can be cut down depending on
  how many salmon slices you wish to prepare, but make sure you use 2
  parts of water to 1 part of vinegar.
  
  NOTE:  Pork chops are delicious prepared the same way, with the
  exception that you leave them in the brine 24 hours or longer.

      1 lg Piece caul fat or

      5 lb To 6 lb coarse (kosher)
           -salt or rock salt

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      3 sl Fresh ginger root
      3    Whole garlic cloves,
           -lightly crushed
      3    Whole scallions, cut into
           -3-inch sections
      1 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Bean sauce
      2 tb Thin soy sauce
      1 tb Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
      1 tb Sugar
      1    Whole star anise
      1 ts Whole Sichuan peppercorns,
           -roasted
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
      8    Whole stems Chinese parsley
 
  Method: Salt-roasting
  
  [This marinade can also be used on roasted duck. S.C.]
  
  Fill the chicken with the marinade, skewer it shut, and allow it to
  dry for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  1.  Wrap the chicken in a large piece of caul fat or cheesecloth
  soaked in oil.
  
  2.  Heat the salt in a pot [heavy Dutch oven, big wok or whatever can
  take the heat.  S.C.] on top of the stove over a low flame or in the
  oven at 350F for at least 1 hour.  Pour off some of the salt, leaving
  just enough to cover the bottom of the pot.  Lay the chicken on top
  of the salt in the pot and cover it with the remaining salt.  Cover
  the pot and bake the chicken for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  3.  Remove the chicken from the salt.
  
  4.  Pull off the salt that remains caked on the chicken.  Be careful,
  because the salt is hot.
  
  5.  With a paper towel, wipe away the remaining salt.  (The salt in
  the pot can be reused.)
  
  6.  Peel off the caul fat, drain the marinade, and cut the chicken
  into bite-size pieces.
  
  Serves 4 to 6 as a main course.
  
  May be served hot or cold; if cold, the chicken may be prepared up to
  a day in advance.  (Do not reheat.)
  
  Suggested beverage: Pinot Noir or Burgundy
  
  From "Chinese Technique" by Ken Hom with Harvey Steiman.  Simon and
  Schuster, New York.  1981.
  
  This is a good "guest" food.  You can appear to have mastered esoteric
  Oriental cooking techniques without ever having actually prepared the
  dish before...  Unless you drop the pot on the kitchen floor and set
  it on fire with the hot salt, it's a pretty foolproof cooking
  technique.
  
  I'd serve this two recipe with hot mustard, a bowl of hoisin sauce,
  Chinkiang vinegar, spiced salt and a bowl of chopped green onions for
  dipping along with some sweet Chinese pickles and lots of ice-cold
  Oriental beer.  Heaven!  (And rice, of course.)

      1 ts Minced Chinese parsley

      1 c  Warm water
      2 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Cold chicken stock or cold
           -water
      5 lb Rock [or Kosher] salt
           Chinese parsley for
           -decorating
 
  I'm posting a couple of recipes for "Salt Baked" chicken.  They're
  slightly different, but both good.  The salt acts as the cooking
  medium and adds little, if any saltiness to the dish.
  
  Cooking time: 1 1/2 hours
  
  BEFORE COOKING:
  
  Wash bird and blot dry with paper towels.  Hang for 1 to 2 hours in a
  cool, dry place.  Combine the ginger root, scallion, parsley, dried
  tangerine peel, salt, pepper, orange wine and water in the bowl.  Tie
  or sew the bird's neck opening.  Pour the marinade into the body
  cavity.
  
  Sew cavity shut to prevent marinade from leaking.  Combine cornstarch
  and stock or water.  Have rock salt ready to go.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Put the rock salt in the casserole.  Turn heat to high and stir salt
  crystals until they become red-hot, about 30 minutes.  Scoop out
  enough salt to make a well in which you can place the chicken,
  leaving a bed of salt about 2 inches thick.  Place the filled bird
  breast-side-down in the salt and pack it all around with the
  scooped-out salt.  Cover casserole and reduce heat to medium-low.
  Cook for 45 to 60 minutes.  Remover bird and cut away threads.  Pour
  marinade from the cavity into a strainer over the pint saucepan.
  Chop chicken into Chinese-style serving pieces and arrange on a
  platter.  Heat the marinade over medium heat until boiling.
  
  Give the cornstarch-stock mixture a quick stir to dissolve any lumps;
  add to marinade.  Stir for 1 to 2 minutes or until the mixture
  becomes clear. Pour over bird.  Decorate with sprigs of Chinese
  parsley and serve.  The chicken will be tender and moist without
  being overly salty.  It will have a subtle fragrance.
  
  Servings:  Enough for 4 as a single course or for 6 to 8 in a full
  menu.

      Yield: 12 eggs
 
  1 1/2 c  Rock salt
      4 c  Fresh water
     12    Fresh eggs, preferably duck
           -eggs
 
  Bring water and rock salt to a boil; cool.  Place eggs in a crock or
  glass jar.  Pour salt-water mixture over eggs to cover.  Cover crock
  and let stand in a cool place (not refrigerator) for three weeks.
  Remove eggs from salt bath and store them in the refrigerator if not
  ready to use immediately.  Yolks should be a bright yellow-orange
  color and quite firm. The white should be slightly cloudy and still
  runny.  Eggs without a firm yolk should be discarded.  To hard cook,
  cover with fresh cold water and simmer for 20 minutes.  Shell an
  quarter.  Serve with hot rice or congee.
  
  NOTE:  Salted duck eggs may be purchased in mud-pack form or in brine
  in Oriental markets.  If in mud pack, scrape off mud, wash well and
  proceed with recipe.

      Title: Saltimboca Alla Romana
 Categories: Italian, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     12 sl Of veal from the upper leg,
           -cut 1/2 inch thick
     12    Thin slices prosciutto (fat
           -and lean)
     24    Fresh sage leaves
           Flour
      6 tb Butter
  1 1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
 
  Put the veal slices between sheet of wax paper and pound them with
  the flat side of a meat cleaver to make them slightly thinner than
  they were cut. Season them with salt and pepper, place 2 sage leaves
  (dried sage is a poor substitute for this dish, but it may be used if
  necessary) and a slice of prosciutto on each slice, fold the slices
  in half, secure with toothpicks, and dust with flour.  Melt the
  butter in a large frying pan (or use 2 frying pans with slightly more
  butter so that all of the veal may be cooked at the same time) over
  fairly high heat, add the slices of veal, brown quickly for about 2
  minutes on each side, reduce the heat a, and continue cooking for
  about 5 minutes, or until the veal is just tender. Do not overcook.
  Transfer the veal to a hot serving platter, remove the toothpicks,
  and keep warm.  De-glaze the pan with the wine, scraping the sides
  and bottom with a wooden spoon, reduce by 1/4 and pour over the veal.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: Sambal Kecap (Soya Sauce and Chilli Relish)
 Categories: Indonesian, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 tb Dark soya sauce
           Juice of 1/2 a lemon or 1
           -lime
      2    Cabi rawit (page 51),
           -crushed, or 1 tsp chilli
           -powder
      2    Shallots, sliced very thin
      1    Clove of garlic, crushed
           -(optional)
      1 tb Boiled water
 
  In Indonesian "kecap" is pronounced "ketchup".  Some folks say this
  is the origin of our word for the red stuff.
  
  The "cabi rawit" referred to below are the tiny bird peppers.  You
  could substitute any hot chili.
  
  This is a very simple sambal, quick and easy to make.  It is ideal for
  adding just a little piquancy to such dishes as Mie Jawa, any sate
  (especially if you don't like peanut butter sauce), and Nasi Goreng.
  
  Mix all the ingredients well together just before serving.

      3    Eggs
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Potato flour
   3/16 c  Rice flour
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  I was getting ready to ship off the Danish cookbook to Ted when I
  remembered that you had asked for a recipe for Danish pastry.  Here's
  a gen-u-wine one, several variations and a short recipe for Sand Cake
  that got snagged with the Danish recipe.
  
  Mix the butter and sugar, add the eggs one at a time, and finally the
  sifted flour and vanilla extract.  Bake in a moderate oven about 1
  hour, or until golden brown.  If baked only 45 min. the cake will be
  underdone but tastier.

      Title: Sate Babi (Pork Sate)
 Categories: Indonesian, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 kg (1 1/4 lb) fillet  of pork
      1 tb Melted pork fat or  butter
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      2 ts Dark soya sauce
      2 ts Lemon juice

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      2 tb Clear soya sauce
      2    Cloves garlic, crushed
      1 ts Ground ginger
      1 ts Five spices
      1 tb Clear honey
    1/2 ts White pepper
 
  An important difference between this and other kinds of sates is that
  we do not usually eat pork with peanut sauce.  We eat it by itself,
  or with Sambal Kecap.
  
  Cut the pork into small thin squares and marinate for 2 hours.  Push
  on to bamboo or metal skewers.  Put these on a rack or in a roasting
  tin and cook in a preheated oven at 350F (gas mark 4) for 30 minutes,
  turning them over several times.
  
  Mix the fat (or butter) with the crushed garlic, soya sauce and lemon
  juice. just before serving, brush the sate with this soya and lemon
  mixture, and grill for 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve immediately.
  
  Most readers will know that the 'five spices' used in this recipe are
  a Chinese ingredient, the mixture being composed of star anise,
  fennel, cloves, cinnamon and pepper.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  salt, for 15 to 20 minutes.  If using spinach, cook in a covered pan
  with just the water that clings to the leaves, adding salt to taste.
  Cook until tender, drain, set aside.
  
  Gently but firmly squeeze all the moisture you can out of all the
  greens. Chop together, but not too fine.
  
  Put oil and garlic in medium saute pan and saute over medium heat
  until garlic becomes lightly colored.  Add chopped greens, turning
  with a fork so they are evenly coated, seasoning with salt and
  pepper.  Saute about 10 minutes, turning frequently.  Taste and
  correct seasoning.

    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper

  Foods wrapped in dried lotus leaves become infused with an exotic
  earthy flavor.  If lotus leaves are not available, you can wrap the
  rice filling in oiled parchment.  Besides being an unusual appetizer,
  this dish can be served as a snack, for lunch, or as a light meal.
  Note that the first step must be done the night before.  Because
  lotus leaves vary so much in size, eight packets may require anywhere
  from four to ten leaves. (Larger leaves can be split in half, smaller
  leaves may need to be overlapped.)
  
  1.  The night before, pour boiling water over the lotus leaves and
  let them soak for 1 hour.  Rinse and squeeze them dry.  Mix the long-
  grain and glutinous rice together in a large bowl.  Wash the rice
  under running cold water; gently stir and rub the grains between your
  fingers to loosen all the excess starch.  Continue until the water
  runs clear. Drain thoroughly. Mix the rice with the chicken stock in
  a 2-quart saucepan; soak overnight in the refrigerator.
  
  2.  The next day, set the saucepan of rice uncovered over high heat;
  bring to a boil.  Stir just enough to loosen the rice grains.  Reduce
  the heat to medium-high and boil until the liquid is absorbed, about
  8 to 10 minutes. Put the sausages on top of the rice and cover the
  pan.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes.  Turn off the
  heat but do not remove the cover.  Let the rice stand for 10 minutes,
  then, with a wet wooden spoon, transfer it to a large bowl; set aside.
  
  3.  Squeeze the mushrooms dry.  Cut off the stems at the base and
  discard them; cut the caps in half.  Combine the marinade ingredients
  in a medium bowl.  Cut the chicken breast into 3/4-inch chunks and
  toss it with the marinade.  Add the mushrooms and marinate for 20
  minutes.  Drain and coarsely chop the shrimp.
  
  4.  In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, sugar, white pepper, and
  sesame oil; mix into the cooked rice.  Add the chicken-mushroom
  mixture and the shrimp.
  
  5.  Fold a lotus leaf in half and put it on a cutting board.  If the
  middle stem or edges are tough and hard, trim and discard them.  (If
  the leaves are small, you may need to over- lap halves.) Divide the
  rice mixture into 8 portions; place one portion in the center of a
  leaf half. Fold the edges over the rice to make a 4-inch square
  packet.  Tie it with twine. Repeat with the remaining leaves and
  rice.  Arrange the packets in a single layer in a bamboo steaming
  basket.
  
  6.  Prepare a wok for steaming.  Steam the packets over medium-high
  heat for 20 minutes.  Remove them from the steamer and cut each
  packet across the top to expose its contents.  Serve with small
  dishes of soy sauce for dipping.
  
  NOTE:  Sweet glutinous rice is also known as "sticky rice" because
  when it is cooked it becomes sticky.  It is used to make poultry
  stuffing and leaf-wrapped rice packages; it is called sweet rice
  because it is often used to make sweet dishes.  Soak it overnight

      Title: Savory Egg Custard with Clams and Shrimp
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Juice from canned clams
  1 1/4 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
      1 ts Oil
      1 ts Rice wine
      1 ts Light soy sauce
    1/4 ts Sugar
        pn White pepper
      4    Eggs
    1/2 c  Canned whole baby clams
      3 tb Chopped Chinese garlic
           -chives, or green onions
      6 md Shrimp, shelled, deveined
      1 ts Oyster sauce
 
  This steamed egg dish exemplifies the simplicity of Chinese home
  cooking it takes about 5 minutes to prepare.  The Chinese use a heat-
  proof porcelain shallow bowl 7 inches wide by 3 inches deep with
  sloping sides to steam this egg dish.  A 1 quart ceramic souffle dish
  or a Pyrex bowl works just as well.  To ensure a smooth, silky
  texture, avoid high heat when steaming.
  
  Combine the clam juice, chicken broth, oil, wine, soy sauce, sugar and
  pepper in a saucepan; bring to a boil.  Remove from heat; cool
  completely.
  
  Lightly beat the eggs in bowl.  Slowly stir the cooled broth mixture
  into the eggs until thoroughly mixed.  Avoid over-beating.
  
  Scatter the clams and 2 tablespoons of the chives in the bottom of a
  1quart heat-proof bowl.  Strain the egg mixture through a fine mesh
  sieve over the clams.
  
  Bring the water in a steamer to a boil over high heat.  Place the
  bowl on a rack above the boiling water.  Cover, reduce heat to a
  gentle boil, and steam for 2 minutes, or until the eggs begin to set.
  
  Carefully remove cover from steamer, and scatter the shrimp on top of
  the custard.  Cover and steam for 5 minutes longer, The custard is
  done when a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
  
  Carefully remove bowl from the steamer.  Drizzle with oyster sauce and
  garnish with remaining chives.  Spoon over rice.  Serve hot.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

      Title: Savory Kasha Stuffing for Poultry
 Categories: Poultry, Stuffing, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 serving
 
      1 c  Buckwheat groats
      1    Egg (slightly beaten)
      2 c  Boiling water
      3    Strips bacon (cut in pieces)
      4 tb Butter
      1 md Onion (chopped)
      1    Clove garlic (minced)
    1/2    Green pepper (chopped)
    1/4 lb Mushrooms (chopped)
      1 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Sage
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
 
  Kasha is frequently called buckwheat groats.  It is made from
  buckwheat grain and then roasted, which gives it a delicious nut-like
  flavor. Aside from being a tasty stuffing for poultry, this recipe
  makes an excellent side dish in place of rice, potatoes, or noodles.
  So if you have any stuffing left over, be sure to refrigerate it and
  save for a future meal.
  
  Mix the groats with beaten egg, then add to frying pan over high
  heat. Stir constantly until grains separate.  Now add the briskly
  boiling water, cover pan, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, fry bacon in another large frying pan.  When bacon is
  lightly browned, push to one side and add butter.  Let this sizzle
  and add onion, garlic , green pepper, and mushrooms.  Stir well while
  they are cooking so that they do not become too brown.  Add oregano,
  sage, and salt and pepper. Reduce heat and add the cooked groats.
  Mix well, adjust seasoning, and remove from heat.
  
  This is enough for a small roast chicken and more than enough for 2
  Cornish game hens.  Increase ingredients for goose.

      Title: Scallops St.jacques, a la Provencal
 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Finely chopped yellow onion
      2 tb Finely chopped green onion
      2 ts Finely chopped garlic
      1 c  Flour
           Salt and pepper
  1 1/2 lb Scallops, cut into 1/4-inch
           -slices
    2/3 c  Dry white wine
    1/4 ts Thyme
      1    Bay leaf
    1/3 c  Grated Swiss cheese
 
  "...For those who love a harmony of softly blended flavors with the
  faint suggestion of seafood..."
  
  Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a skill over medium heat.  Add the
  onions, green onions and garlic.  Cook, stirring often, for about 5
  minutes, or until the onions are tender but not browned.  Using a
  slotted spoon, remove the onions and garlic and set aside.
  
  Put the flour, salt and pepper on a large piece of waxed paper, and
  stir with a fork to mix well.
  
  Dip the scallop slices into the flour mixture and coat well.  Shake
  off excess flour.
  
  Melt 2 tablespoons of the remaining butter in the skillet and quickly
  saute the scallops in it until they are lightly browned.  Lower the
  heat and add the wine, thyme, bay leaf and onion mixture.  Cover and
  simmer for 5 minutes.
  
  Remove the scallops with a slotted spoon and spread them in a layer
  in a shallow baking dish.  (I use a 10-inch pie plate, but you may
  use 4 large scallop shells, if you prefer).
  
  Briskly boil the scallop cooking liquid for about 1 minute to reduce
  and thicken it.  Pour the sauce over the scallops.  (This may be made
  early in the day and covered and refrigerated until just before
  serving.) About 3 minutes before serving, sprinkle the cheese over
  the scallops, dot with remaining butter, and run under the broiler
  just long enough to melt the cheese and lightly brown it.  Serve hot.
  
  Serves 4.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
      4 lb Pork scraps with bones OR 1
           -hog's head, split
      1 ts Salt
      6    Peppercorns
      3    Whole cloves
      1    Bay leaf
      2 c  Cornmeal
      1    Onion, finely chopped

    1/2 ts Or more ground sage
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
 
  Here's a Pennsylvania Dutch version of scrapple.  You'll probably have
  better luck rounding up pork scraps than a pig's head, although you
  could probably pick one up at an Asian or Latino market.
  
  Parboil pork scraps or head, in water to cover, for 10 minutes. Drain;
  discard water. return to pot with fresh water to cover, salt,
  peppercorns, cloves and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil, cover and simmer
  for 3 hours, or until meat falls off the bones easily.  Strain stock;
  reserve. Remove all meat from bones and chop; set aside.
  
  Reheat stock; gradually add cornmeal, stirring constantly until thick,
  about 15 minutes.  Add meat, onion, cayenne, nutmeg and sage; adjust
  seasonings with salt and pepper.  Pour into 2 greased loaf pans.
  Refrigerate until set.  Slice and fry for breakfast.  Will keep in the
  refrigerator for up to 1 week.

  Clean shrimp and reserve shells.  Poach shrimp in well salted water
  with pickling spice.  Discard liquid.  Poach halibut in wine until
  set. Do not overcook.  Steam clams in white wine and garlic.  Remove
  from shells and reserve liquid.  Leave smaller clams whole and
  coarsely chop larger ones. Gently toss seafood together and dress
  with olive oil.  Set aside.
  
  SAUCE:
  
  SPECIAL REQUIREMENT:  cheesecloth, parchment paper, rice flour.
  
  Steep threads in white wine for 30 minutes.  Cook shrimp shells in
  hot oil just until they turn pink.  Then combine them with thyme, bay
  leaves and peppercorns in cheesecloth.  Saute onion until soft and

  lined with parchment paper and sprinkle with rice flour to keep dry.
  Cover with plastic.
  
  TO COOK:
  
  Use a wide pan with plenty of water.  Cook 3 or-4 raviolis at a time
  for 3 to 4 minutes, removing them with a slotted spoon.  Serve on a
  bed of the Spanish sauce.

      Title: Seasoning Mixture for the Mongolian Grill
 Categories: Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Information
 
  Here's a couple of Mongolian Beef recipes for you.  Incidentally, I
  have one of the Mongolian grills.  It's a heavy, dome shaped,
  perforated cast iron grill with raised edges about 11 inches in
  diameter.  I use it on an Iwatani table top gas burner.  It's a great
  hit for guests.  Easy on the chef too.  I just slice up all the
  ingredients, make the marinades and dips then put it all on the table
  and turn everyone loose to cook their own. Had a hard time finding it
  but finally tracked one down in a Japanese hardware store in San
  Francisco.  It was about $25.00.  A substitute would be a hibachi
  with a wire mesh cover laid on the grate.  These are quite unlike the
  "Mongolian Beef" served in restaurants over a bed of deep fried
  cellophane noodles.
  
  Basically, what you do is slice the meat of your choice into thin, 1 x
  3-inch strips then dip them in the marinade and toss 'em on the grill
  until they're done to your taste.  Eat them with steamed buns or
  rolls. If you like, sliced veggies can be used too.
  
  1/2 c  scallions 2 ea garlic cloves, crushed 1/4 c parsley, chopped 1
  c water 1/2 c soy sauce 1 T sugar
  
  Enough for four.  Mix ingerdients and serve in four smaller bowls.
  Allow about 1/4 lb of tender fillet of beef or lamb.

 Categories: Chinese, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      1    Scallion, minced
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Soy paste
      1 tb Sweet soy jam
    1/2 ts Chinese chili sauce
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
           Raw eggs, beaten and placed
           -in individual bowls
 
  This is a variant sauce with a slightly different cooking method.
  
  These amounts are for individual serving bowls.  Increase them to
  suit the number of diners.  In this case, each diner grills the meat
  first then dips it in the raw egg to coat, then in the bowl of
  seasonings. Also served with steamed buns.  If soy paste and sweet
  soy jam are unavailable, substitute peanut butter (or tahini, I would
  imagine) and black currant jam.

           Salt
    1/4 c  Heavy cream
      1 tb Rose water
    1/4 c  Blanched almonds
 
  Grind the cumin and coriander seeds in a spice mill, combine with the
  red pepper and place near the stove.  Soak the saffron in hot milk.
  
  Heat the ghee or clarified butter in a large, shallow, heavy pan.
  
  Stir in the onions, cardamom pods, cinnamon, cloves and bay leaves.
  Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onions begin to
  turn reddish brown, about 15 minutes.  Add the ginger and garlic and
  cook, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan, until
  the onions are reddish brown.
  
  Stir in the ground spices and cook, stirring, for about 10 seconds, or
  until the spices release their fragrance.
  
  Dry the meat with paper towels.  Stir half of the meat into the spice
  mixture.  Increase the heat to medium high and cook, stirring for a
  few minutes, making sure all the meat is coated with the spices.
  Stir in the remaining meat, and cook as before, scraping the bottom
  of the pan.
  
  If the mixture gets too dry, splash in a little water.
  
  Turn the heat to medium.  Start adding the yogurt 1 tablespoon at a
  time, stirring and incorporating it into the mixture before adding
  the next tablespoonful.  Continue adding in this way until all the
  yogurt has been used.
  
  Turn the heat to low.  Cover the pan and simmer the meat for about 1
  1/2 hours, or until the meat is very tender.  If necessary, splash in
  a little water from time to time.  When the meat is tender, and salt
  to taste. Stir the cream and cook until the sauce is thick.  Stir in
  the saffron and rose water and heat thoroughly.
  
  Fry the almonds in a little oil until golden brown.  Serve the lamb
  piping hot garnished with the almonds.  (The whole spices in this
  dish are not meant to be eaten.) Serve this dish with a pilaf or any
  Indian bread.
  
  NOTE:  Ghee is sold in Indian markets.

      Title: Shanghai Style Sweet and Sour Ribs
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 lb Pork spareribs, cut across
           -bones into 1 1/2 inch
           -length
           Peanut oil
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/3 c  Chinese rice vinegar
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Dark soy sauce
      2 c  Sugar, brown, dark
      2 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  Soy sauce, light
    3/4 c  Molasses, dark
    1/2 ts Galangal, ground
    1/2 ts Cilantro, ground
    1/2 ts Pepper, black
 
  This one isn't for the barby, but I thought I'd pass it on anyway.
  Don't be deceived by the simplicity of this recipe.  It's one of the
  very best sweet and sour rib recipes I've run across as well as being
  one of the easiest. The taste of the ribs shines through rather than
  being overwhelmed as it often is with more complex sweet and sour
  recipes.
  
  Combine and sugar and water in a 2-quart stainless steel saucepan and
  bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until the sugar
  dissolves. Increase the heat to high and cook briskly, uncovered, for
  5 minutes or until the syrup reaches 200F on a candy thermometer.
  Reduce the heat to low, stir in the soy sauce, molasses, galangal,
  cilantro, and pepper, and simmer for 3 minutes.  Remove from the
  heat; let cool.
  
  Strain the sauce through a fine sieve set over a bowl.  Sauce will
  keep at room temperature for 2 to 3 months if tightly covered.

  This is some serious food++as most of these recipes are.  They are the
  creations of one of the most intense culinary environments in the
  world and the competition is fierce.  I've never seen the Bamboo
  Fungus called for in this soup in any of the Asian markets I've been
  in and preparing a Shark's Fin is not for the impatient.

  Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award - Shark's Fin "Gossamer
  curtains veiling exquisite feminine shadows" would be a justifiably
  poetical translation for the mood-setting name of this dish. The
  bamboo fungus, a deluxe vegetarian ingredient with almost mystical
  connotations, is envisaged as a curtain of delicate fibres, through
  which the beguilingly beautiful forms of the superlative shark's fin
  can be glimpsed. Red Mayflowers (denoted by the crab roe) are
  "embroidered" on the curtains, adding a third level of appetizing
  connotations.
  
  To prepare 1. Soak, shark's fin for 4 hours in cold water, and then
  simmer over medium heat for 10 hours. 2. Clean bamboo fungi and soak
  in cold water for 3 to 4 hours. 3. Steam-clean crab claws for
  approximately 3 minutes on plate on wok stand above boiling water. 4.
  Make shrimp paste by mixing shrimp meat with cornstarch and pinch of
  salt.
  
  To cook 1. Mix simmering ingredients with water (sufficient to cover
  fin) and bring to the boil.  Add cooled shark's fin and boil for 5
  minutes. Dram well and stuff inside bamboo fungi. 2. Arrange stuffed
  fungi on a deep plate.  Mix 1 cup of stock and 1/4 tsp of salt and
  pour over fungi. Cover and steam for 15 minutes. 3. Coat each claw
  with 10 g of shrimp paste, garish with a sprig of coriander, place in
  a deep plate, cover and steam for 3 minutes. 4. Add 1 cup oil to
  heated wok, then add asparagus and saute for 30 seconds. Drain and
  place asparagus in 3 cups of salted water and simmer until just
  cooked. Drain and refresh with cold water. 5. Stir-fry bean sprouts
  in a heated wok with 1 tbs oil, 1/2 tsp salt and ginger juice until
  half-cooked, but still crunchy.  Remove from wok. 6. To make crab roe
  sauce, add water, cornstarch and salt to stock. Over a high flame,
  bring to the boil.  Add crab roe and bring to the boil again (at
  which point presentation platter should be ready for this sauce).
  
  To present 1. Arrange stuffed bamboo fungi like spokes of a wheel,
  pointing inwards on serving dish.  Lay asparagus and crab claws
  between them. 2. Pour freshly boiled crab roe sauce over dish.  Pile
  bean sprouts in centre, top with shredded ham.

 Categories: Chinese, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      6 c  Boiling water
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1    Dozen 1/2-inch sections of
           -garlic shoots or

      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Salt
 
  Ran across these three short recipes utilizing ginseng.  Thought
  someone into herbs and/or Chinese medicinal cooking might find them
  interesting. Note the measurement for "a heaping tablespoon vegetable
  oil" in the last recipe.  Ginseng must be pretty miraculous stuff if
  you can heap tablespoons of oil...
  
  Put seasonings in a bowl and pour the boiling water into it.  This is
  a good drinking soup that goes well with a heavy dinner.

      Title: Shepherd's Roast with Drunken Sauce
 Categories: Mexican, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      5 lb Leg of lamb

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      3    To 4 dried chili pasillas or
      4 tb Chili powder
  1 1/2 c  Tepid water
      2    Cloves garlic
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 lg Onion, cut into chunks
      2    Pickled Serrano chilies, or
           -any small red or green hot
           -pepper
      2    Ounces dry grated cheese
      8 tb Tequila
  2 1/4 tb Salt
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 tb Dry red wine
    1/2 tb Lime juice
 
  (Shepherd's Roast with Drunken Sauce]            )
  
  In Hidalgo, halves of mutton are hung over a wood fire and slowly
  turned until the meat is cooked and the outside is crisp and black.
  
  Toward the end of the cooking process, the roast is basted with
  lightly salted butter.  It's served with Salsa Borracha, below.
  
  FOR THE ROAST:
  
  Use a 5-pound leg of lamb and roast it on a spit over a charcoal fire
  until done the way you like it (1 1/2 to 2 hours).  Baste from time
  to time with lightly salted butter in which a clove of garlic has
  been crushed and a pinch of dry mustard added.
  
  In an ungreased skillet, cook the dried chili pasillas for a few
  minutes, turning occasionally to prevent burning.  Skip this step if
  chili powder is used.  Remove stems and seeds and cover them with the
  water, saving the skins.  In about 3/4 hour, put the chilies in a
  blender with the remaining ingredients and 4 tablespoons of the water
  in which the chili seeds were soaked.  Blend all until smooth.
  Strain the remaining chile water and add to sauce.  Serve, either by
  pouring a little over each portion of meat, or letting guests help
  themselves.  Add more chili powder or chilies for a hotter sauce.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: Shoulder of Veal Braised in White Wine, Sage & Garlic
 Categories: Italian, Veal, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This series was inspired by a current plenitude of cheap veal down
  under. The column advised buying the small carcasses that were
  selling for $2.50 to $3.00 (Oz dollars...) as a way to save money.
  
  Raw Materials would like to be able to tell you the prove- nance of
  this recipe but, since we have been cooking it for more years than we
  care to remember and. in any case. modified it way back when, to get
  rid of the fat, its origins are lost in the mists of time. Given the
  ingredients, it probably originated in Italy or France. Don't worry
  about the amount of garlic. The long slow cooking tames it completely.
  
  Into a saucepan or pot large enough to take the veal should- er (if
  necessary, cut into the joint between the shoulder blade and foreleg
  so that it bends more), put 2 or 3 stems of fresh sage or about 2
  teaspoons of dried, about 10 peeled cloves of garlic, halved if they
  are large, and about 2 cups of dry white wine. Put in the shoulder of
  veal, cover the pot and simmer very slowly for 2-2.5 hours. If you
  wish, you can add thick slices of potato about three quarters of an
  hour before the end of cooking.
  
  Remove the veal, potatoes and garlic cloves to a hot serving dish and
  carve the veal into thick slices. Remove and discard the sage from
  the cooking liquid, taste it and correct the seasoning, then boil the
  liquid fiercely for a couple of minutes to reduce it. Pour over the
  veal and potatoes and serve. This liquid will set to a clear,
  flavourful aspic, so if you have any veal left over (unlikely),
  refrigerate the liquid till it is just beginning to gel, then spoon
  several layers of it over the veal. This leaves you with a delicious
  cold dish for the next day.
  
  Serves 3 or 4.

      Title: Shrimp Chips
 Categories: Chinese, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Net weight of shelled
           -shrimp, prawns or lobster
      1 lb Tapioca flour
      1 oz Salt
      1 ts White pepper powder
      1 c  Water
 
  I think there is one step left out of the process.  If I were making
  this I would pound the shrimp to a paste before adding them to the
  rest of the ingredients.  This book is quite interesting, but the
  translation leaves a bit to be desired.  The recipe intrigues me, but
  I've never actually gotten around to trying it out.
  
  You can make your own home made shrimp chips with which no one can
  compare. Here is the recipe for non-commercial shrimp chips.
  
  Bring water to a boil and dissolve salt and pepper powder.  Pour
  boiling water onto the tapioca flour in a large mixing bowl and stir
  quickly with a cooking spoon.  Add in the shrimp and knead as a
  dough. As the water content of the shrimp is unpredictable, you may
  adjust it by adding more boiling water.  The dough should be on the
  hard side.  Now shape into a cylinder about 1 inch in diameter.  If
  you do not have the proper steamer for this process, a bamboo rack or
  cake cooling rack will do. Lay a cheesecloth underneath and on top of
  the dough and place it on the rack. Make sure the cylinders of dough
  are far enough apart (at least 1 1/2 inch if space permits) to
  prevent them from sticking together. Steam at a high temperature for
  45 minutes.  Make sure there is plenty of water in the steamer to
  avoid having to open it to add more water.
  
  After steaming, bring out, remove the cheesecloth, and cool the dough
  on another rack.  Keep in a cool place to dry.  The time varies from
  1 day to 2 or 3 days.  If you can cut it with a very sharp knife,
  then start to cut it in thin slices (about the thickness of a penny).
  Now lay the slices on a piece of cardboard and dry in the sun until
  brittle. Don't hurry the drying before you cut them.
  
  You can store them indefinitely in a can.  When you want to use them,
  calculate 2 or 3 chips per person.  Deep fry in oil at 360F
  temperature. If the process has been done correctly, the chips will
  be done in a matter of seconds.  They will increase their size
  several times. Drain and serve.
  
  Use them as a garnish for crispy fried chicken or duck etc.  You can
  also use them as hors d'oeuvres or as appetizers.

      Title: Shrimp on Sugar Cane (Chao Tom)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Raw shrimp in shell
      4    Cloves garlic
      1 ts Rock sugar, pounded to a
           -powder, or 1 teaspoon

           -minutes and diced very
           -small
      1    Twelve-inch section sugar
           -cane
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil, approximately
           Basic Vegetable Platter
           -[see below]
     12    Dried rice papers (banh
           -trang)

MMMMM-------------------NUOC LEO WITH TAMARIND------------------------
      1 tb Tamarind paste
    1/2 c  Plus 3 tablespoons water
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
    1/3 c  Tuong
      1 ts Granulated sugar
      2 tb Peanut butter
      2 tb Roasted Peanuts
 
  The "tuong" referred to below is a Vietnamese soybean preparation++a
  kind of thin, salty paste.  If you can't find it, you *might* get
  away with substituting Chinese bean sauce, mashed and thinned a bit
  with water, or possibly a dark Japanese miso. Although you can make
  this in a food processor or blender, it's best to pound it in a
  mortar with a pestle to achieve that certain crunchiness which is a
  most desirable quality of much Vietnamese food.  Bach started using a
  mortar and pestle when she was thirteen years old, working with a
  pestle that was about a yard long and 5 inches in diameter.  Although
  her family hand many servants, her mother, a great cook, wanted Bach
  to learn to use this tool properly. And Bach, who loved to cook as
  much then as she does now, was a willing and eager student. In
  Vietnam, where this is a very important dish, both the sugar cane and
  shrimp, fresh from the sea, are brought to the door by the country
  people.  If you cannot obtain sugar cane, you can prepare this dish
  with crab claws instead. In the West, we have been making this in the
  oven. Originally it was barbecued over charcoal, and if you with you
  can do the same.  Just cook it for 10 minutes on each side and this
  attractive dish will be reproduced exactly as it is in Vietnam. Shell
  and devein the shrimp, them rinse.  Dry thoroughly in paper towels,
  blotting many times. Mash the garlic in a mortar, then add the
  shrimp, a few at a time and mash to a paste.  If the mortar is not
  large enough, it will be necessary to remove the already prepared
  shrimp paste to make room for the additional shrimp to be pounded.
  After all the shrimp is reduced to a smooth paste, pound the sugar
  into the shrimp, then add the egg white and pound with the pestle
  until well blended.  Finally add the roasted rice powder, black
  pepper, and pork fat, combining all the ingredients. Peel the sugar
  cane. Cut into 4-inch lengths and then split lengthwise into
  quarters. Pour about 1/4 cup of oil into a bowl.  Dip your fingers
  into the oil and pick up about 2 tablespoons of shrimp paste.  Mold
  it into an oval, around and halfway down the sugar cane, leaving half
  of the sugar cane exposed to serve as a handle.  Proceed until you
  have used up all the shrimp paste. Preheat the oven to 350F.  Put the
  shrimp on sugar cane on a baking sheet, then bake for 30 minutes or
  until brown.  Serve with the vegetable platter, dried rice papers,
  and nuoc leo with tamarind, as follows: Each person is given a dried
  rice paper, and, dipping his finger in water, he moistens the entire
  surface of the paper, which soon becomes soft and flexible. He then
  helps himself, from the vegetable platter, to some lettuce, cucumber,
  coriander, and mint, if available.  Then he takes a sugar cane stick,
  removes the shrimp patty, breaks it in half lengthwise, and places it
  on top of the vegetables, all in a cylinder, at one end of the rice
  paper. Then he folds over each side to enclose the filling and rolls
  it up. Holding it in his hand, he then dips it in his own small bowl
  of sauce. While you eat the shrimp in rice paper, you can also chew
  on the sugar cane.  Makes 6 servings. NUOC LEO WITH TAMARIND: Soak
  the tamarind paste in the 3 tablespoons water. Heat the oil and add
  the chopped garlic; cook briefly.  Add the water from the tamarind to
  the saucepan, discarding the remaining tamarind paste and seeds. Stir
  and add the tuong, 1/2 cup water, sugar, peanut butter. Mix well and
  boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Sprinkle the nuts on top of
  the sauce and pour into individual bowls for serving. ROASTED RICE
  (THINH): Roasted rice is used quite frequently in Vietnamese cooking.
  We generally prepare a quantity of it and keep it in a jar to have on
  hand when needed. 1 cup rice Heat a small, dry frying pan over high
  heat and add the rice. Toast, stirring constantly, until rice is
  brown.  Transfer to a blender and grind into a powder. Store as
  suggested above. From "The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam", Bach Ngo and

      Title: Shrimp on Crab Legs (Cang Cua Boc Tom)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 10 servings
 
     10    Crab legs or several hard
           -shell crabs
           Shrimp paste, prepared as
           -for Shrimp on Sugar Cane
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil

MMMMM-------------------------NUOC CHAM------------------------------
      1    Clove garlic
    1/2    Fresh hot red chili pepper
           -or 2 dried
      2 ts Heaping, granulated sugar
    1/8    Fresh lime
      2 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2 1/2 tb Water, more if necessary
 
  Here we have a party dish that will bring out "oohs" and "ahs" from
  your guests on sight - and a repeat performance on taste.
  
  Crab claws, alone, are sometimes available in fish stores.  If they
  aren't, boil several hard shell crabs and use the claws; you can use
  the bodies in many other dishes.
  
  The crab claws in fish stores are already partially peeled and serve
  not only as a handle but are edible as well.  If you prepare your own
  claws, peel the upper section around which you mold the shrimp paste.
  
  Boil the crab legs or crabs for about 10 minutes, then drain and cool;
  remove the claws from the crabs, if using, and reserve the bodies for
  another purpose.
  
  Have the shrimp paste ready; preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  Pour the oil into a bowl.  Dip your fingers into the oil and pick up 2
  tablespoons of the shrimp paste.  Mold it into an oval around and
  halfway down the crab claw, covering the part of the claw where it
  was attached to the body; this will leave a claw tip extended to
  serve as a handle. Place the claws on a baking sheet and bake in the
  preheated oven for 30 minutes.
  
  Serve with Nuoc Cham and watercress.
  
  NOTE:  In Vietnam, this dish is always barbecued over charcoal.  If
  you wish to prepare it this way, cook for 10 minutes on each side.
  
  Makes 10 servings.

  NUOC CHAM:
  
  This exciting sauce is almost always served at Vietnamese meals, just
  a Westerners serve salt and pepper.  It's base is nuoc mam (bottled
  fish sauce).  Freshly prepared, it is a constant delight, and so
  addictive to Western palettes that it will appear with meals other
  than Vietnamese. To best appreciate the results of its superb
  blending qualities at the table, use it sparingly at first, gradually
  adding more until the result is just right for your palate.
  
  Peel the garlic.  Split the chili pepper down the center and remove
  the seeds and membrane.  Cut into pieces and put into a mortar,
  together with the garlic and sugar.  Pound into a paste.  Squeeze the
  lime juice into the paste, then with a small knife remove the pulp
  from the lime section and add it as well.  Mash this mixture and add
  the fish sauce and water.
  
  NOTE:  If you find this a trifle strong at first, dilute it with an
  additional 1/2 tablespoon of water.

      Title: Sichuan Crispy Skin Duck
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Fresh Duck, 4 1/2 pounds
      3    Or 4 Star Anise
      2 ts Sichuan peppercorns
      1    Two-inch cinnamon stick
  1 1/2 tb Coarse salt
      1    One-inch cube ginger,
           -smashed
      1    Scallion
           Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Dry sherry or Shaoxing wine
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1    Egg white, beaten until
           -foamy
           Oil for frying
 
  Rinse the duck and dry thoroughly.  Combine the star anise, Sichuan
  peppercorns, cinnamon and salt in a skillet; heat, shaking the
  skillet, until the spices begin to smoke and the salt starts to turn
  a light golden color.  Cool.
  
  Sprinkle some of this mixture into the cavity of the duck including
  all the star anise and the cinnamon stick.  Add the ginger and
  scallion to the cavity and skewer closed.  Rub the outside of the
  duck with the rest of the seasoned salt mixture and hang the duck by
  a string (around the neck if the duck has a head or under the wings
  if not) overnight in a cool, airy place.
  
  The next day, steam the duck on a plate in a large steamer or covered
  wok for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes.  Cool and rub all over
  with a small amount of dark soy sauce.  Wrap in foil and refrigerate
  until ready to cook.  (It's fine this way for a day or two.) Several
  hours before cooking, take the duck out of the refrigerator and make
  a light batter: Mix the sherry with the cornstarch and sugar until
  well blended then stir in the egg white.  Rub thoroughly over the
  duck and allow to sit.
  
  Heat a large quantity of oil until nearly smoking in a 16-inch or
  larger wok or in a large deep fryer.  Immerse the duck in the oil and
  fry until golden, about 15 minutes, spooning the oil continuously
  over the exposed part of the duck.  You might want to turn the duck
  during this time. If so, carefully remove it with a large slotted
  spatula or skimmer and drain the cavity into a bowl before adding it
  again to the hot oil. When the duck is done, drain it on paper
  towels. Let the duck rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then carve it
  Western-style or cut into pieces, Chinese-style. A suggestion is to
  serve it on a bed of watercress that has been sprinkled very lightly
  with sesame oil.  The juices from the duck will blend with the sesame
  oil to make a sauce.
  
  TEA-SMOKED DUCK; Follow the steps above and steam the duck only 1
  hour. Before refrigerating, line a large wok with aluminum foil and
  spread 1 cup of uncooked rice, 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of Chinese
  black tea over the bottom.  Put the duck on a metal rack suspended
  over the tea mixture; cover with the wok lid.  Moisten paper towels
  and press them around the edge of the wok lid forming a seal.  Turn
  the heat to medium high and allow the duck to smoke for 15 to 20
  minutes.  Turn off the heat and let the duck sit for another 45
  minutes.  Uncover, wrap the duck and refrigerate. Then proceed as in
  the master recipe.

 Categories: Chinese, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 tb Dried shrimp
      1 tb Preserved Sichuan Preserved
           -Vegetable (jar choy)
      3 c  Peanut oil for deep frying
      1 lb String beans, snapped in
           -half
      1 tb Minced ginger
      1 tb Finely chopped garlic
      4 oz Ground pork butt
      1    Green onion, minced
      1 ts Sugar
        pn White pepper
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Chicken stock
           A swirl of sesame oil
 
  This green-bean dish is outstanding.  The green beans exude aromatic
  flavors and have an interesting chewy texture.  I do not fry the
  beans as long as traditional recipes call for because I want them to
  have some texture left.
  
  Cover the dried shrimp with hot water for 30 minutes.  Drain.  Chop
  into the consistency of coarse bread crumbs.
  
  Rinse the Sichuan preserved vegetables with cold water to wash off the
  brine and salt; chop into the same texture as the shrimp. In a hot
  wok add the oil and heat to 375F.
  
  Deep fry the beans in two or three batches for 2 to 3 minutes or
  until they look wrinkled, blistered and khaki color.
  
  Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the oil from the wok.  Reheat the wok
  over high heat.
  
  Add the ginger and garlic; stir-fry for 15 seconds.  Add the pork,
  preserved mustard, dried shrimp; stir-fry for 1 minute longer. Poke
  and break up the clumps of pork so that it looks crumbled.  Add the
  green onion, sugar, white pepper and soy sauce; toss together to
  blend.
  
  Return the reserved green beans, chicken stock and sesame oil; toss
  vigorously over high heat until all liquids are reduced and absorbed,
  about 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

  [Heh!  Had you guys going with that kibble reference I'll bet.
  "Ceideburg's finally gone over the edge.  A pity..." Picked up a
  genuine cookbook for dog food yesterday.  It's called "Bone Appetit!"
  Too cute, huh? Since I don't even like to cook for myself very much
  the pooch will just have to make do with leftovers, but it is an
  interesting book.  Lots of doggie lore like the following about
  Basenjis, the "Silent Stalker" of the recipe title.]
  
  Basenjis are depicted in ancient Egyptian scrolls looking exactly as
  the breed does today.  Eventually Basenjis migrated further south in
  Africa, becoming silent stalkers for tribesmen in the Belgian Congo,
  where they were discovered by British explorers in the late
  nineteenth century. With an expressively wrinkled forehead, a tightly
  up curled tail, and no bark at all, the Basenjis was immediately
  favored as an export. Fastidiously clean by nature, the Basenjis has
  a grooming ritual that is similar to a cat's and involves licking the
  entire coat to clean it. The Basenjis' chortle, described as an
  appealing yodel, is its most distinguishing characteristic.
  
  MULTI-GRAIN DOG KIBBLE: 2 cups whole wheat flour 1 1/2 cups
  all-purpose unbleached flour 1/2 cup soy flour 1 cup cornmeal 1 cup
  nonfat dry milk powder 1 cup rolled oats 1/2 cup wheat germ 1/2 cup
  brewer's yeast 1 tablespoon salt 1 large egg 5 tablespoons corn oil 3
  cups water
  
  Preheat oven to 350F and grease two 13 x 9-inch baking sheets. In a
  large mixing bowl, combine whole wheat, all-purpose and soy flours,
  cornmeal, milk powder, oats, brewer's yeast, and salt.  In a small
  bowl, combine egg and corn oil.  Stir water into dry ingredients,
  then add egg mixture, mixing well.  The batter will be thin.
  
  Divide batter between baking sheets, spreading evenly 1/2 inch thick,
  as though for pizza.  Bake for 45 minutes.  Cool kibble, then break
  into small pieces.  Store in covered container in refrigerator, or
  divide into individual servings, place in freezer bags, and freeze.
  
  Makes 20 cups kibble.

      Title: Sizzling Rice Soup
 Categories: Chinese, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Hot, cooked short-grain
           -white rice
    1/4 lb Medium-sized prawns in the
           -shell
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Cornstarch
        ds Pepper
    1/2 lb Napa cabbage
  1 1/2 c  Oil for deep frying
      1 qt Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Fresh or defrosted frozen
           -peas
 
  For when you finally burn out on hot and sour soup, here's a bonus!
  
  It's relatively simple, except for the rice part and well worth the
  effort.
  
  Press hot cooked rice into a thin layer (no more than 1/4 inch thick)
  on a baking sheet.  Place in a preheated 300F oven for 30 minutes.
  Remove from the oven, turn the rice layer over, and return it to the
  oven for an additional 30 minutes.
  
  Remove from oven, and when cool enough to handle, break into 3-inch
  pieces.
  
  Shell, devein, wash and drain prawns.  Dice prawns and place in a
  bowl. Add salt, sugar, soy, cornstarch and pepper; mix well. Cut Napa
  cabbage into 1-inch wide pieces.
  
  Heat oil in wok to 325F
  
  Meanwhile, bring chicken stock to a boil.  Add prawns, peas and Napa
  cabbage.  Return to a boil.
  
  Deep fry rice patties in hot oil until golden brown (about 5 minutes).
  Remove and drain on paper towels.
  
  Pour the hot soup into a deep serving bowl and immediately add the
  rice patties.  Both the rice patties and the soup must be as hot as
  possible to produce the sizzle.
  
  If the timing isn't perfect, the soup can be reheated but the rice
  patties cannot.  (This final step, which is quite showy, may be done
  at the table.)
  
  Serve at once.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
  
  NOTE:  The rice patties can be baked 2 weeks in advance, stored in an
  airtight container and refrigerated.  They also can be frozen for up
  to 2 months.

 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 c  Ketchup
    1/2 c  Cider vinegar
      2 tb Hot sauce
      1 md Onion, grated
      3    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1    Rack of pork ribs, about 4
           -pounds
           This is a pretty typical US
           -BBQ treatment.
 
  Combine the ketchup, vinegar, hot sauce, onion, garlic and
  Worcestershire sauce in a mixing bowl and stir until blended.  Pour
  half of the sauce into a glass baking dish large enough to hold the
  ribs in a single layer. Place the ribs meaty side down in the sauce.
  Pour remaining sauce over; cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.
  
  Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are thickly coated with ash. If
  you are using a gas grill, preheat on low for 5 minutes with the lid
  closed.
  
  Place the ribs on a rack set at least 6 inches from the fire.  Grill
  slowly, for 15 minutes.  Turn and baste with sauce.  Ribs should have
  browned slightly.  If they still look raw, stoke the fire.  If they
  have browned a great deal or scorched in spots, move ribs to a cooler
  part of the fire.  Cook for 15 minutes, baste, and turn again.  Grill
  for 30 to 45 minutes longer, turning and basting, every 5 minutes.
  Watch the fire carefully, keeping flames away from the ribs.
  
  To serve, slice the rack into individual ribs and pile on a heated
  platter.

  simmer, and skim off any foam that comes to the surface.
  
  Add the sliced onion, celery, parsley, thyme sprig and bay leaf;
  simmer, uncovered, skimming occasionally, for 2 to 4 hours.  (The
  longer you cook it, the richer the stock will be.)   Do not let the
  stock boil or it will turn cloudy.
  
  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet (preferably cast iron), over
  medium heat.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring and scraping the
  entire bottom of the pan at least every 10 seconds, until the
  resulting roux cooks to a deep mahogany color, 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  Adjust the heat to prevent scorching, which can give a bitter taste.
  Turn off the heat and continue stirring a minute or two until the
  mixture no longer gets darker on the bottom.
  
  Carefully stir in the diced vegetables tables; don't let the roux
  splatter it can cause nasty burns.  Stir to coat the vegetables
  evenly with roux; stir in the chile powder, salt, pepper, herbs and
  cayenne; set aside. (The roux may be prepared to this point while the
  stock cooks.) Strain the stock, let it stand until the fat rises to
  the top, and skim off the fat.
  
  Bring 8 cups of the stock to a boil in a large pot, stir in the roux
  vegetable mixture and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15
  minutes.
  
  Add the shrimp, crab and/or oysters and simmer just until done, about
  5 minutes.  Taste for seasoning and correct if necessary. Serve in
  soup bowls over small scoops of rice.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

      Title: Smothered Pork Chops
 Categories: Creole, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Rich beef broth
        pn Sage leaves, crumbled
      6    Thick loin pork chops
      1 c  Flour for dredging
           Salt and pepper, to taste
    1/2 c  Lard
      3 lg Onions, sliced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/4 c  Celery, minced
 
  We get recipes for Seoul food here but not many for soul food.  A big
  lack, I think as I love the stuff.  The following four recipes are
  from the California Culinary Academy over in the city and comprise a
  soul food dinner.
  
  No matter where they're served, smothered meat dishes are extremely
  popular (and remarkably similar) throughout the South:  chops heaped
  high with sauteed onions and a spicy brown gravy.  This
  Mississippi/Louisiana recipe borrows several New Orleans Creole
  techniques.
  
  1.  In a small saucepan melt butter over medium-high heat, stir in
  the 2 tablespoons flour, and cook, stirring constantly with a wire
  whisk, until lightly browned.  Stir in broth and sage, mix well,
  remove from heat, and set aside.  This mixture will be the sauce.
  
  2.  Add salt and pepper to the 1 cup flour; dredge chops in the
  mixture. In a large, heavy skillet heat 1/4 cup of the lard over
  medium- high heat. Add chops and cook until they are browned.  Move
  browned chops to a large, oven proof casserole with a cover.  Preheat
  oven to 350F.
  
  3.  Melt the remaining lard in skillet over high heat.  Add onions,
  garlic, and celery; lower heat to medium, and cook, stirring
  frequently to avoid burning, until onions are golden (about 8 to 10
  minutes). Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and place over chops
  in the casserole.
  
  4.  Pour off all lard from the skillet.  Add reserved sauce, raise
  heat to high, bring to a boil, and cook for 1 minute, stirring
  vigorously and scraping the bottom of the skillet.  Pour sauce over
  chops in casserole, cover, and bake for 30 minutes.  Serve with
  mashed potatoes.
  
  Serves 6.

      Title: Soesaties
 Categories: Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 lb Mutton fillet (leg)
      2 tb Butter or drippings
      2 lg Tablespoons chutney
      3    Onions (chopped)
      5    Or 6 lemon leaves
      1 tb Sugar
      1 c  Vinegar (or 1/2 milk)
      1 tb Curry powder
           Seasoning
           Corn flour
 
  Cut the meat into cubes of about 1 1/2 inches of fat and lean.  Put
  into a basin and season with salt and pepper.  Lightly brown the
  onion in the butter then add the curry powder, sugar, chutney and
  vinegar.  Simmer for 5 minutes then pour the sauce over the meat,
  adding the lemon leaves. Leave in the sauce overnight, then arrange
  the meat on skewers, alternating the lean and the fat.  Drain out of
  the sauce and grill over a clear fire. Bring the sauce in which the
  meat was marinated to the boil and thicken with a little corn flour
  that has been mixed to a paste with cold water. Pour this over the
  soesaties and serve very hot with rice and additional chutney if
  desired.  Soesaties may be fried, but in that case they should be cut
  into somewhat larger pieces and should not be placed on skewers. (If
  there is not sufficient fat on the mutton, extra should be used.)

           Scallion green
 
  An excellent way to get twice the pleasure out of your fish purchase.
  You can use either the fish head of the fish carcass if you wish. To
  the people of the South, this is as much their traditional dish as
  Southern Fried Chicken is to our southerners++and it will meet with
  instant praise
  
  Sprinkle the scallions, black pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, and 4
  teaspoons fish sauce over the fish head.  Allow to stand for 10 to 15
  minutes.
  
  Bring 1 quart of water to a boil and drop in the sour bamboo and
  pineapple slices.  Cook at a lively boil for 5 minutes.  Drop fish
  head into the actively boiling water and, keeping at a boil, add the
  2 tablespoons fish sauce, remaining teaspoon salt, and a dash of MSG.
  Boil the fish head for a total of 10 minutes.  Transfer to a soup
  tureen, sprinkle on the coriander and scallion green, and serve.
  
  NOTE:  If the fish head is dropped into water that is not boiling, it
  will fall apart.

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine

      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans
 
  Everyone has banana bread recipes, but this one uses buttermilk which
  I thought was interesting.
  
  Banana bread is made all over the Northern Hemisphere but this recipe
  is from the South.
  
  Combine flour, soda and salt in a mixing bowl.  Cream butter with
  sugar and beat in eggs with bananas, buttermilk and vanilla.  Stir
  into dry ingredients and fold in nuts.  Spoon into a greased 9 x
  5-inch pan and bake in a preheated 350F oven for about an hour, or
  until bread tests done in the center.

           -imported Italian
      6    To 10 garlic cloves,
           -coarsely chopped
      1    Piece fresh ginger,

      2 tb Fresh basil leaves, thinly
           -sliced or coarsely chopped
      2 tb Fresh mint leaves, thinly
           -sliced or coarsely chopped
 
  This one looks a tad odd.  Any adventurous pasta eaters out there?
  
  Fragrant fresh ginger, flakes of hot red pepper and a hefty jolt of
  garlic season this pasta dish.
  
  Boil spaghetti until al dente.
  
  Meanwhile, heat garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes in olive oil,
  cooking until garlic becomes golden around the edges.  Do not let it
  brown!
  
  Drain spaghetti.  Remove ginger slices and toss spaghetti with
  garlic/red pepper mixture; season with salt to taste.
  
  Toss with basil and mint; serve immediately.

    1/4 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Salt
        ds MSG (optional)

MMMMM-------------------------B MIXTURE------------------------------
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Flour
           Oil for deep frying
           Lettuce leaves, shredded
 
  Green onion, Chinese parsley and cashew nuts, all chopped, for
  garnish This is one of the better deep-fried chicken recipes I've
  found.  It calls for chicken wings, but I used a whole chicken, cut
  up Chinese style and just increased the marinade ingredients a tad.
  
  Serve this with side dishes of hoisin sauce, spiced salt (toasted salt
  mixed with black pepper about half and half), hot mustard and chili
  oil along with a bowl of finely chopped scallions.  Dip piece of
  chicken into the dip of your choice, then into the scallions and
  enjoy!  Ice cold beer goes great with this dish.  Oh yeah++steamed
  rice too...
  
  Be sure to use the dark, toasted sesame oil rather than the health
  food store stuff.
  
  1.  Soak cut-up chicken in marinade ingredients A for 1 hour.  Mix
  ingredients B into bowl with marinated chicken.  Stir well.  Will be
  very sticky and stiff to mix.
  
  2.  Heat 2 inches oil in wok to 375F.  Drop batter covered chicken
  piece by piece carefully into hot oil.  Do not fill wok too full of
  chicken or it will take too long to brown.  Should take only 5
  minutes to cook through. Result will be crispy golden brown chicken
  pieces.
  
  3.  Drain on paper towels.  Place on platter lined with lettuce
  shreds.
  
  4.  Garnish if desired with chopped green onions, Chinese parsley and
  cashew nuts.

  A while back Earl was kind enough to send me a cookbook he authored.
  
  It's a small paperback on camp cooking that has both tips on things
  like how to avoid eating freeze dried noodles and grayling for six
  days straight and recipes tailored for the camp cook.  Since I go
  camping about once every other decade, I don't think I'll wait to try
  the following...
  
  Here is a breakfast better than many get at home.  With the cheese and
  seasonings, it makes getting up in the morning a pleasure.
  
  Melt butter with oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Mix potatoes and
  flour.  Add potato, paprika, garlic powder and Italian seasoning to
  skillet and cook until potatoes are just tender, stirring often for
  10 minutes. Combine eggs with parmesan cheese in medium bowl.  Season
  with salt and pepper.  Pour egg mixture over potatoes.  Pierce holes
  in egg mixture and lift edges with spatula, tipping pan to allow
  uncooked egg to flow under, until edge forms, about one minute; do
  not stir.  Reduce heat to low, cover skillet and continue until eggs
  are set.

  I found this excellent recipe for chutney the other day.  It uses
  cranberries for those folk that were looking for cranberry recipes
  not too long ago.  I think this is better than Major Gray's
  chutney... but then, whadoo I know?
  
  Combine first 9 ingredients in heavy medium sauce pan over medium-
  high heat.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat to low
  and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Add sugar, pears, apple, cranberries and currants and stir until sugar
  dissolves.  Cook until fruits are soft and liquid thickens slightly,
  stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.  Cool to room temperature
  (chutney will thicken more as it cools).  Cover and refrigerate.
  Bring to room temperature before serving.

    1/2 c  Sugar
           Zest of 1 orange, julienned
           Zest of 1 lemon, julienned
           Juice of 2 lemons
           Juice of 2 oranges
      2    Whole cloves
      2    Cinnamon sticks
      4 sl Fresh ginger

           -cored
           Burnt Sugar lee Cream (see
           -recipe)
 
  Combine the wine, water, sugar, citrus zest and juice, cloves,
  cinnamon, ginger, peppercorns and vanilla bean in a heavy saucepan.
  Bring to a boil, add pears, then reduce heat so the liquid barely
  bubbles. Cook for 15 minutes, or until the pears are tender.  If
  pears aren't completely submerged in liquid, turn them every few
  minutes so they will cool evenly.
  
  When the pears are tender, remove from liquid and set aside.  Reduce
  liquid to 1 cup over high heat.  Return pears to liquid and let cool
  completely.
  
  Before serving, warm the pears in their liquid over moderate heat.
  Place a warm pear on a chilled plate; spoon some poaching liquid over
  the top. Place a scoop of ice cream next to the pear and top with a
  few threads of julienned zest from the sauce.
  
  Serves 4.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
     12    To 18 jumbo shrimp
    1/2 c  Pumpkin seeds (pepitas in
           -Mexican markets)
      1 sm Onion, cut into chunks
      3    Garlic cloves
    1/2 bn Fresh cilantro, leaves only

  This is from Narsai David, a cosmopolitan Lebanese restauranteur, food
  writer and all-around nice guy from the Bay Area.
  
  Clean, peel and devein the shrimp.  Set aside.
  
  To make the sauce, prepare the pumpkin seeds first.  If they are
  unroasted, put them in a heavy skillet with out oil or butter and
  toast them for a few minutes until they are crackly but not browned.
  Put them in a food processor or blender and reduce to a fine powder.
  Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, tomato, chiles, bell pepper,
  coriander seeds, and salt and pepper.  Puree until smooth.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a skillet, add the pureed
  pumpkin seed mixture, and cook gently for a few minutes, stirring
  from time to time, until it is well blended.  If too thick, stir in a
  little clam juice; if too thin, continue to cook until it is reduced
  to the desired consistency.
  
  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet, add the
  shrimp, and saute over moderate heat until just beginning to turn
  pink. Using a slotted spoon, remove from the pan to a heated platter.
  
  Add the sauce to the pan.  Add the lemon juice and adjust the
  seasoning. Return the shrimp to the pan, turning to coat them with
  the sauce.  Serve immediately.
  
  Serves 6.

      1 c  Oil

    1/2 lb Bacon
      1    Hard boiled egg
 
  This is the first salad I ever tasted that I actually LIKED rather
  than just endured.  And that was when I was in my early thirties!  I
  got it from my cousin and she got it originally from Sunset Magazine
  if I remember correctly.  At any rate it's excellent.  One of the few
  salads that I consider a full meal in itself.  The dressing has
  become my house dressing. I usually make a double recipe.  Keeps good
  in the fridge.
  
  Mix the dressing ingredients and set aside to blend flavors.  Clean
  the spinach and lettuce and tear into pieces.  Fry the bacon crisp
  and crumble it into not-too-small pieces.  Chop the egg coarsely.
  Toss it all together and add dressing to taste.

 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
    1/2 lb Raw shrimp, shelled and
           -deveined
           Black pepper
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
      2    Scallions, both white and
           -green parts
    1/2 lb Pork butt
      1 ts Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      1    Clove garlic
      1 tb Vegetable oil
     10    Dried rice papers (banh
           -trang)
 
  For dieters or the cholesterol conscious++an oven baked version of
  spring rolls.  In Vietnam these are often baked over charcoal. Cut
  the shrimp into small pieces and sprinkle with the black pepper and
  the sugar. Slice the scallions crosswise into very thin slices. Slice
  the pork into thin pieces, 3 x 2 x 1/8 inch.
  
  Combine half the slice scallion with the shrimp and meat, the fish
  sauce and a dash of black pepper.
  
  Chop the garlic fine; place on a platter near the stove, along with
  the remaining scallions.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the garlic and remaining scallion briefly until
  they brown slightly.  Add the pork-shrimp mixture and keep stirring
  over high heat until cooked, about 5 minutes.
  
  Cut or break the 10 rice papers into quarters.  Place the cut rice
  papers on a flat surface.  Using a pastry brush, or your fingers,
  paint water over the entire surface of each of the pieces; this is to
  make the brittle papers become soft and flexible.  Try working an
  about 10 quarters at a time.  This will help you work faster.  While
  some of the wrappers become pliable, you can be filling the others.
  
  Place 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 small pieces of pork on the pointed
  end of a paper, arranging the filling in a square shape.  Bend the
  pointed end over the filling and roll twice, then fold the sides over
  and continue to roll into a 2-inch-long cylinder about 1 inch thick.
  Place on a tray, with the open end on the underside to prevent
  unrolling, while you fill the remaining rolls.  Place the rolls in
  the oven, directly on the oven rack, without preheating.  (They can
  be crowded together while baking so that you can get many onto 1
  rack.) Again, be certain to place them open end down; turn the oven
  to 350 degrees and bake them for about 40 minutes, 20 minutes on each
  side.
  
  NOTE:  These can be filled several hours before cooking, covered with
  a plastic wrap, and refrigerated.  Or they can be baked and then kept
  at room temperature for several hours.  They never lose their
  crispness. Use bamboo chopsticks or tongs for turning the rolls.

 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Squid, cleaned and cut open
           -into flat pieces
    1/2 c  Evaporated milk
      1    Egg, beaten
      1 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
      1 c  Cracker meal
           Oil
 
  This recipe is from Abalonetti's, an Italian seafood restaurant on
  Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey, Ca.  The specialty of the house is to
  fix squid so as to be indistinguishable from abalone.  They do a fine
  job of it too!  I've gained many pounds from scarfing down their
  excellent squid. It's plain, simple, to the point and very, very
  good!!!  Give this to those folks who say "Eeeauu, I HATE squid!".
  
  Combine milk, egg, salt and pepper.  Dip squid in mixture and roll in
  cracker meal.  Place squid in a single layer in hot oil in a 10-inch
  frying pan.  Fry at a moderate heat until lightly browned.  Turn
  carefully. Cook the other side.  Drain on absorbent paper.  Serve
  with lemon wedges.

  golden, the squid should be done...

      Title: Squid Cooking Information

      Yield: 1 servings

  Squid isn't tough when correctly prepared.  Here are a few basic
  rules to keep in mind followed by squid recipes from all over the
  world. From the International Squid Cookbook...
  
  "When heated, squid protein becomes firm rapidly and then turns chewy
  until long cooking breaks down the muscle.  Much of the squid's
  reputation as a tough food comes from lack of knowledge of this
  simple fact. Sautes should be cooked no longer than three minutes and
  stews no less than twenty minutes.  Squid cooked for less than twenty
  minutes or more than about three minutes probably will be tough.  If
  you don't believe me, just try it.
  
  Squid absorbs water quickly from marinades and sauces.  Thus it can be
  prepared rapidly and still acquire all the flavoring of its
  accompaniments. Marinades do help the flavor of squid, but only up to
  a point. Squid should never be marinated too long.  Half an hour is
  probably the optimum time. After that, the meat starts to soften and
  may even take on a bitter taste if lemon or vinegar is used.
  
  Squid, like any seafood, is fragile.  It should be refrigerated until
  just before use to keep it as fresh as possible.
  
  The dark ink of the squid is its means of defense.  It shoots it at
  intruders who venture too close, creating an obscuring cloud behind
  which the squid makes a quick getaway.  The ink itself is a salty,
  black liquid which makes an excellent flavoring for sauces.  It is,
  not surprisingly, water soluble.  Don't worry if you get ink on your
  hands or clothes.  It washes right out."

      1    Onion, chopped
    1/4 c  Almonds
      2    Fresh chiles, finely
           -chopped, or
      1 ts Cayenne
      1 ts Grated lemon peel
      1 ts Tamarind concentrate,
           -dissolved in
      2 tb Water, or
      2 tb Lemon juice
      1 ts Lemon grass (dry), or
      1    Stalk fresh lemon grass,
           -chopped
      1 tb Brown sugar
    1/4 ts Shrimp paste or *
      1 ts Dried, salted shrimp
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  * (known as shrimp sauce in China),
  
  This is probably the most exotic of these recipes.  No country of
  origin is given, but from the name and the process it must be
  Indonesian or Malaysian.
  
  This dish has several unusual ingredients for which there are adequate
  substitutes available.  In any case, all the exotic ingredients are
  available at Chinese grocery.
  
  In a food processor, purse the onion, almonds, chiles and shrimp
  paste.
  
  In a large, heavy frying pan or a wok, saute the spice paste in oil
  over low heat.  When it turns dark brown, add tamarind water, the
  lemon, lemon grass and sugar.  Saute a minute more, then add the
  squid.  Turn up the heat and cook for 3 minutes, adding water if
  necessary to keep the sauce from sticking.  Remove from heat and
  serve over rice.
  
  As a main course this dish serves 3; as a side dish, 6 or more.

 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 lb Squid, cleaned and cut into
           -rings
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
      4 tb Butter or olive oil
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
           -(optional)
           Lemon wedges
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  The easiest and, many people think, the best way to prepare squid is
  to saute it.  The basic recipe and variations provided here do not
  begin to cover the many ways to saute squid.  This dish takes 10
  minutes or less to make once you have cleaned the squid.
  
  If you are using garlic, saute it in 1 Tb of olive oil or butter in a
  heavy frying pan over low heat until it is lightly browned.  Turn up
  to a medium-high flame.  Add the rest of the oil, and when it is hot
  the squid, parsley, salt and pepper.  Saute for 3 minutes.
  
  Serve with lemon wedges and boiled or fried potatoes.
  
  VARIATIONS:
  
  1.  Add quartered, cooked artichoke hearts or coarsely sliced beets
  along with the squid.
  
  2.  Substitute 1 tsp of dried or fresh dill, or 2 Tbs of fresh basil
  for parsley.
  
  3.  Substitute 1 tsp cayenne for black pepper.

      3 lb Squid, cleaned and cut into
           -rings
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
    1/2 c  Mirin, or 1/2 cup sherry
    1/2 c  Water
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Cornstarch
           Juice of 2 lemons
 
  To make the terriyaki sauce, combine all the ingredients except the
  cornstarch.  Reserve half of the sauce, marinate the squid in the
  other half for 1 hour.
  
  Prepare the fire.  Skewer squid pieces and tentacles.  Heat the
  reserved terriyaki sauce in a saucepan.  When it begins to boil, add
  the cornstarch dissolved in a little water.  As soon as the sauce
  thickens, remove from heat.  As it cooks you will baste the squid
  with this terriyaki sauce.
  
  Grill the squid until it turns dark brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side,
  depending on the heat, and then turn it over.  Baste one last time
  and then remove skewers from the fire.  Serve over rice accompanied
  with any remaining sauce.

    250 g  Halved macadamia ants
    250    Halved Brazil nuts
    1/2 c  Grand Marnier or Cointreau.
 
  From the traditional to the (comparatively) new-fangled.  Stained
  glass or bishopcakes, very popular in the US, are so called, one
  presumes, because they consist almost entirely of glace fruit and
  nuts, and the glace fruit has something of the translucency of a
  stained-glass church window.
  
  [This is news to me.  I've never heard either of the two terms
  applied to fruit cakes.  Other terms, maybe, but not those...  S.C.]
  
  Butter a round 23 an cake tin and line with grease proof paper.
  
  Butter the grease proof.  Chop the glace fruits roughly.  Sift
  together the flour and baking powder.  Mix in all the fruits,
  together with the nuts. Put the mixture into the cake tin, wet hands
  and press mixture down firmly.
  
  Bake in a preheated 150C oven for 1 1/2 hours.  Take cake out of the
  oven and drizzle the Grand Marnier or Cointreau over the top.  Leave

      Title: Steamed Buns
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  Here's a recipe for a basic steamed bread dough and some fillings for
  steamed buns.  These are all easy and tasty.  If you don't want to
  hassle with making the dough, you can use frozen bread dough and get
  good results ++they're better baked than steamed, though.  I do that
  a lot.
  
  The sausage buns are quite good when baked.  Also, if you have a bread
  making machine that can be set to stop at a certain point in the
  process, that would save time too.
  
  Any of these ingredients can be had at an Asian grocery and in many
  supermarkets these days.
  
  Steamed or Baked Bun Dough
  
  Yield: 2 dozen buns
  
  1 ea cake of fresh compressed yeast 1 3/4 c warm water 3/4 c sugar 1 t
  baking powder 6 1/2 c unsifted all purpose flour
  
  TO MAKE THE DOUGH:
  
  Dissolve 1/2 yeast cake with sugar in warm water.  Immediately add
  baking powder and then the flour.  The dough will be fairly firm and
  a bit on the dry side.  Knead on board or 20 minutes (you should not
  need to flour the board) until dough becomes elastic and smooth.
  Place it in a big mixing bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a
  dry, warm place (away from drafts) until dough doubles in bulk.
  (Every kitchen is different. My dough usually takes about 2 1/2 to 3
  hours to double in my electric oven, which I slightly preheat to a
  warm setting for 2 or 3 minutes then turn off.) Now punch down dough
  and knead again for 5 more minutes. It is no ready to be stuffed with
  fillings.
  
  Comments:  This is just a basic yeast dough with perhaps a bit more
  sugar added. For those of you who do not care to make this from
  scratch, you may use frozen bread dough as a substitute.
  
  FILLING AND COOKING THE BUNS:
  
  Wrapping:
  
  Divide filling into 24 portions.  Divide dough into 24 balls.
  
  Slightly flatten each ball then roll out into 4-inch discs, leaving
  the center of the disc twice as thick as the side.  Place 1 portion
  of the filling in the center of the dough.  Gather up the sides
  around the filling and twist dough to seal.  Place on a 2 inch square
  piece of wax paper, twist side down.  Put the wrapped buns at least 2
  inches apart on a cookie sheet and allow the buns to rise in a
  draft-free place (the oven) for another hour.
  
  Steaming:
  
  Steam for 15 minutes.  Turn off heat and let steam subside before
  lifting cover.  [If you don't have an Oriental steamer, you can
  improvise by setting a plate on an upside down bowl or can with the
  ends cut out in a big kettle or stock pot.  Fill the pot with water
  up to the bottom of the plate, but not so high that the boiling water
  slops over the edge. S.C.]
  
  Baking:
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Set buns 2 inches apart on cookie sheet.
  
  Brush with a mixture of 1 beaten egg white, 1 teaspoon water and 1/4
  teaspoon sugar.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.
  Brush with melted butter.

      Title: Steamed Butterfish in Bean Threads
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      8    To 10 dried shiitake
           -mushrooms
  1 1/2 oz To 2 oz bundle bean threads
      1 lb Butterfish (about 6),
           -cleaned
    1/3 c  Chicken stock
      2    Green onions, shredded
  1 1/2 tb Shredded ginger
  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Asian sesame oil
 
  There are a couple of kinds of butterfish.  One is the large
  "sablefish". The other is the smaller silvery diamond shaped fish
  familiar to those who hang out around Asian markets.  This calls for
  the latter type.
  
  In separate bowls, soak the mushrooms in warm water and the bean
  threads in hot water until soft, 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain the
  mushrooms, discard the stems, and toss the caps with a teaspoon of
  soy sauce. Drain the bean threads and place in a deep heat-proof
  plate or glass pie pan that will fit inside a wok or other steaming
  pot.
  
  Arrange the fish on top, tucking the mushroom caps in around them.
  Pour in the chicken stock, scatter the green onion and ginger on top
  of the fish, and sprinkle with the remaining soy sauce.
  
  Bring the water in the steamer to a rolling boil and place the plate
  on a rack an inch above the water.  Cover and steam for 20 minutes.
  Sprinkle with the sesame oil and serve from the steaming dish. Serves
  2 to 3 as a main dish, 4 with other dishes.

      Title: Steamed Fish with Fish Gravy
 Categories: African, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Whole red snapper or
           -similar fish, 2 to 4
           -pounds, gutted and split
           With the head on
      1    Lime
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Freshly ground pepper
      8    Garlic cloves, minced
      2 tb White wine vinegar
      1    Fresh hot pepper, minced
      2 md Onions, thinly sliced
      1 sm Green pepper, thinly sliced
      1 lb Shrimp
      1    Fish head
      3 c  Water
      1    Stalk celery
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 c  Flour
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Thyme
 
  Here's one that I though you might like as it's African in origin.
  Looks pretty tasty to me!  Although it calls the fish "steamed" it
  would probably be more accurate to call it braised.
  
  Wash the fish with the juice of the lime.  Rinse, drain and pat dry.
  Cut 3 or 4 diagonal gashes in each side of the fish, cutting forward
  toward the head.
  
  Make a mixture of the salt, pepper, 2 cloves of the garlic, the
  vinegar and a little of the minced hot pepper.  Grind to a paste.
  Rub the gashes and the inside surfaces of the fish with the paste.
  Place the fish in a flat glass baking dish and cover with the onions
  (reserving a few), the green pepper and the remaining garlic and hot
  pepper.  Marinate for one hour.
  
  Meanwhile, shell the shrimp, reserving the shells.  Coarsely chop the
  shrimp and set aside.  Place the shells and the extra fish head in a
  large saucepan with the water, reserved onion and celery.  Simmer for
  15 minutes.
  
  Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet.  Shake the marinade off
  the fish and dredge the fish in flour.  Fry quickly, for 3 to 4
  minutes on each side, until golden brown but not done.  Lower the
  heat and add the marinade vegetables.  Pour in 2 cups of the
  fish-shrimp stock.  Add the bay leaf, thyme and a little more salt
  and pepper.  Cover and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove
  the fish and vegetables with a slotted spoon to a serving dish.  Set
  aside and keep warm.
  
  Add 2 tablespoons flour to the skillet and stir.  Cook slowly,
  scraping the bottom of the skillet, until the gravy starts to
  thicken. Strain the gravy and return it to the now clean skillet.
  Add the shrimp and cook until they turn pink and the gravy is thick.
  Serve the shrimp gravy over the fish.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  From the "Family of the Spirit Cookbook:  Recipes and Remembrances
  from African-American Kitchens," by John Pinderhughes (Simon and
  Schuster. 1990).
  
  The author recommends that if you can't get another fish head,
  decapitate the fish and use it to make the stock.  Snapper is called
  for but he says that Hawaiian relatives of snapper ++onaga, opakapaka
  or ta'ape can be substituted as can Pacific rockfish.

 Categories: Chinese, Rice, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  How to Save a Pot of Burnt Rice:
  
  If the rice should scorch while it is cooking, the pot of rice may
  still be rescued.  Simply place a dampened cloth or a slice of bread
  and I or 2 tablespoons of water over the surface of the rice, cover,
  lower the heat to a simmer and cook until rice is tender.  The cloth
  or bread will absorb the burnt smell.
  
  [This really does work quite well.  I've done the bread version and it
  saved the meal.  S.C.]
  
  Steamed Glutinous Rice:
  
  Glutinous rice may be prepared in the same manner as steamed long-
  grain rice by increasing the soaking period to 4 hours and the
  cooking time to 35 minutes.
  
  How to Reheat Rice:
  
  Cooked rice may be reheated in several ways.  To reheat by simmering,
  place the rice in a saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.  Then for each
  cup of rice, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of water over the surface of the
  rice, cover and simmer over low heat until the rice is hot.  To
  reheat by steaming, place the rice in a heat proof bowl, sieve or
  colander and place this with about 2 inches of water in a large pot.
  Cover and steam over medium heat for 10 minutes or until heated
  through. To reheat in the oven, place rice in heat proof dish or pan
  and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of water for each cup of rice over the
  surface.  Place, covered, in a preheated 400F oven for 20 minutes.

  This one pretty much sums up the idea that in Asia things are not
  always what they seem.  Looking at the picture, I see what are
  obviously steamed pears++complete with stems++with a couple of water
  caltrops on one plate and steamed finger citrons (an Asian fruit that
  looks sorta like a hand) accompanied by a couple of peaches on the
  other plate. (Water caltrops are those seeds that look like a set of
  miniature water buffalo horns.) What these things really are, though,
  are steamed, stuffed sweet dumplings. I really wish I could post a
  .gif with this message. These things look REAL! Somehow, I doubt that
  anyone will want to attempt this one, but here it is just in case.

  THE NEVER ENDING STORY (12 servings) Chef: Yau Shing (Yung Kee
  Restaurant) "Longevity" would be an over-simplified literal
  translation for this dual presentation of treasured culinary symbols
  crafted out of flour. Peaches symbolize longevity, and fairy tales
  often feature water caltrops (bull horn-shaped roots) as part of the
  fairy diet.  The Fairy Mother herself is given peaches on her
  birthdays.  The finger citrons, a kind of fruit, have long
  represented Buddha, owing their resemblance to the shape of Buddha's
  palm.  The combination of associations - with long life, happiness,
  elegance and spiritual peace - heightens the diner's admi- ration of
  the culinary sculptures.
  
  To prepare and cook: 1. For sesame paste filling, stir-fry sesame
  seeds in a dry, heated wok until golden. Set a quarter aside and
  grind rest to powder. 2. Stir-fry flour in a dry wok, over a low
  flame, all slightly yellow.  Then sift it.  Mix all filling
  ingredients together.  Place in refrigerator until firm. 3. For
  doughs (made in two batches, one with spinach juice, one with boiling
  water). Heat spinach juice or water. Pour hot liquid into a mixing
  bowl containing wheat starch and glutinous flour. Mix well. Remove
  mixture to a clean working surface and add remaining ingredients one
  a time, working up a smooth texture. 4. For pear shaping, form
  spinach-dyed dough into small balls of approximately 4 g each.
  Flatten round discs.  Do same for uncoloured dough. Place one
  uncoloured disc on top of a dyed dough disc.  Place a small portion
  of sesame paste filling on top, and mould discs upwards around it to
  form pear shape. Stick one dry twiglet into top end of pear shape.
  Press lightly on bottom of pear shape to form a firm base. 5. Steam
  for 3 to 5 minutes. (If shrimp roe not available, chocolate powder
  could be dusted over the pears after they have cooled.) (The water
  caltrop garnish recipe is not included. it is also steamed dough with
  colouring.)

      1 tb Sherry
 
  Here's a couple of simple, good recipes that use black bean sauce.
  Just in case you don't know, these black beans are the Chinese
  fermented black beans.  They're extremely salty++and should be rinsed
  before use++ and have a very nice, savory taste that blends well with
  many foods. Very common in Chinese markets and I've seen bottles of
  ready prepared black bean sauce in supermarkets in the Oriental food
  sections.  Just substitute the deep fried tofu cubes for the meat in
  these recipes. One of these recipes is for pork spareribs and one for
  prawns. They'll give you an idea of how the beans are combined with
  the other ingredients to come up with the sauce.
  
  Yield: 4 servings
  
  Preparation:  Have butcher cut spareribs into 1-inch pieces.  Trim
  off fat. Place spareribs in a heat proof dish.  Wash and rinse black
  beans 2 or 3 times, then mash them with garlic, ginger, soy sauce,
  cornstarch and sherry.  Mix with spareribs.
  
  Cooking:  Place heat proof dish on steaming rack in wok.  Add water to
  bottom of wok.  Cover.  Steam for 30 minutes.
  
  Do-ahead notes: Do through preparation.
  
  Comments:  Spareribs can be left in the steamer for 2 hours if dinner
  is late.  Substitute bean sauce for salted black beans++and
  abracadabra! Mein See Jing Pie Quat!  (Steamed Spareribs in Bean
  Sauce.)

      Title: Steamed Stuffed Bitter Melon
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
    1/2 lb Pork, ground [I minced it
           -with cleavers. S.C.]
      4    Fresh water chestnuts,
           -peeled and finely minced
      1 ts Minced fresh ginger root
      2 tb Minced scallion
  1 1/2 tb Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 tb Thin soy sauce
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
      1 ts Cornstarch
      2 lg Bitter melons, about 3/4 to
           -1 lb.

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 tb Peanut oil
      2 ts Minced garlic
  1 1/2 tb Fermented black beans
      1 tb Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
    3/4 c  Chicken broth
           Salt to taste
    1/2 ts Cornstarch mixed with 1
           -teaspoon cold chicken broth
      1 tb Sesame oil
           From Ken Hom's book,
           -Chinese Technique.
 
  Combine the stuffing ingredients in a large bowl.  Mix them
  thoroughly. The hands are the best tool for this job.
  
  Cut the bitter melon into 1-inch slices; discard the end pieces. With
  a paring knife, trim out the insides.  Lift them out.  Stuff the
  cavity of each slice with a generous spoonful of stuffing.
  
  Arrange the stuffed pieces of vegetable on a plate and set the plate
  on a trivet in a wok over enough hot water to come within 1 inch of
  the plate. Cover the wok and steam the food for 20 minutes.  Remove
  the platter and trivet.
  
  In a separate wok or pan, prepare the sauce.  First heat 2 tablespoons
  peanut oil.  Add the garlic and fermented black beans, stir for a
  minute, then add the Shaoxing wine, chicken stock and salt.  Add the
  liquid that results from the steaming of the melon.  Bring the
  mixture to a boil. Thicken with the dissolved cornstarch and flavor
  with sesame oil.
  
  Pour the sauce over the bitter melons and serve.
  
  Serves 2 as a main course.
  
  NOTE:  Hom makes no mention of blanching although another bitter melon
  recipe in another book *does* say that it will cut the bitterness.

  ITALIAN SALAD: (Italiensk Salat)
  
  Mix together cooked diced carrots, finely cut asparagus, small peas
  and mayonnaise.  If home-made mayonnaise is used, add a few drops of
  tarragon vinegar just before stirring in the vegetables.
  
  Press a lettuce leaf as tightly as possible on buttered bread and put
  a thick layer of Italian salad on top; decorate with tomato slices
  and cress.
  
  TOMATO AND EGG:  (Tomat og Aeg)
  
  On one half of a piece of buttered bread place slices of hard boiled
  egg. On the other half arrange slices of tomato.  Garnish with cress.
  
  TOMATO WITH RAW ONION:  (Tomat med raa Loq)
  
  Top the buttered bread with several slices of tomato and put a pile of
  finely chopped, raw onions in the center.
  
  ROAST BEEF AND FRIED EGG:  (Bof med Spejlaeg)
  
  Place tender slices of cold roast beef on buttered bread.  Fry onions
  in deep fat until brown and crisp and spread a layer of these on each
  slice of beef.
  
  Top with fried eggs and serve before the egg cools.  (Danish fried
  eggs are never turned).
  
  RAW BEEF AND EGG:  (Tartar med Aeg)
  
  Scrape a piece of raw beef, preferably very fresh, off the sinews
  with a sharp knife and put a 1/2 inch layer on a piece of buttered
  bread. Make a hollow in the center of the meat, circle it with a ring
  of raw onion, and place a raw egg yolk in the center.  Put small
  piles of raw, chopped onions, shredded horseradish, capers, and
  pickles at each end.
  
  HAM AND SCRAMBLED OR FRIED EGG:  (Skinke nied Roraeg eller Spejlaeg)
  
  Butter the bread and spread it with a piece of lean boiled ham.  Top
  it either with a strip of scrambled egg, sprinkled with finely cut
  chives, or with a freshly fried, warm egg.
  
  HAM, PIGEON BREAST AND MUSHROOMS:  (Skinke med Duebryst)
  
  Butter a piece of dark rye bread and top with a good sized slice of
  ham. Add 1/2 or whole pigeon's breast cut nicely off the breastbone,
  and top the whole thing with stewed mushrooms and a thin slice of
  homemade liver paste.
  
  LIVER PASTE 1:  (Leverpostej 1)
  
  Put 1 lb. liver through the grinder together with 2 onions.  Put 1
  lb. fat pork twice through the grinder.  Mix fat and liver with 1
  tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon pepper.  Put in a fireproof dish and
  bake in a slow oven for 1 hour.  The paste must not become too dark
  on top.
  
  Put thick layers of cold paste on buttered bread.  In winter the
  Danes put slices of pickled cucumber and strips of jellied consomme
  on top, and in summer a small dish of fresh cucumber salad is served
  so that you can put some of this on top yourself.  Don't do it until
  the last minute, however, or both cucumber and liver paste may become
  soggy.

     14 c  Dried tree ear mushrooms
           -(torn into 1/2 inch pieces)

    1/4 ts Sugar
           Big pinch of white pepper
      2 ts Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Chicken stock
      1 ts Asian sesame oil
 
  I belong to the school that feels that a meal isn't a meal unless
  there's meat involved, but this looks like a satisfying vegetarian
  dish. Use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock if you're adamant
  about avoiding animal products.
  
  The article says that for cooking purposes, lotus roots can be
  treated as potatoes and talks about the Japanese using them in
  tempura dishes and coming up with an "exotic potato chip".  Sounds
  good to me! In 2 separate bowls, cover dried black mushrooms and tree
  ears with water until soft and pliable (about 30 minutes).  Rinse and
  squeeze out excess water from both mushrooms.  Remove and discard
  stems from black mushrooms; cut caps in half and set aside.  Pinch
  off and discard hard center from tree ears; tear large pieces in half
  and set aside.
  
  Rinse lotus root with cold water.  Trim and discard both ends of the
  bulb. With a vegetable peeler, peel the skin.  Cut bulbs in half
  length- wise. Lay flat and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices;
  set aside.
  
  Plunge slices into acidulated water.  Drain.
  
  Over medium-high heat preheat wok until hot.  Add oil and tilt wok to
  coat sides.  Add salt, ginger and garlic; stir-fry until fragrant.
  
  Add onions; stir-fry for 15 seconds or until they begin to wilt.  Add
  black mushrooms, lotus root, tree ears, water chestnuts and snow
  peas; stir-fry for about 2 minutes or until snow peas turn bright
  green.
  
  Sprinkle in the sugar, white pepper, and soy sauce; toss a few
  seconds.
  
  Splash the chicken stock against sides of hot wok and use to deglaze
  sides. Cover, reduce to medium heat; cook for 30 seconds.  Remove
  cover, dribble in the sesame oil Serve hot.
  
  Serves 8.

 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Squid, cleaned
           -Chinese-style [See below.
           -S.C.]
    1/4 c  Raw peanuts, roughly chopped
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
      1    Or more fresh chile
           -peppers, chopped
      1 ts Cilantro, chopped (optional)
      2 ts Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Chicken stock
      1 ts Cornstarch dissolved in
      1 tb Stock or water
      3 tb To 4 tb vegetable oil
 
  In traditional Chinese cooking, dishes which are part of a banquet-
  style meal usually contain about 1 pound of food.  This dish will
  serve 4 if there are 3 other dishes besides soup; 6 if there are 6
  other dishes, etc.
  
  Saute garlic and chile peppers in half the oil over low heat in a wok
  or heavy frying pan until garlic is lightly browned.  Add peanuts for
  the last 30 seconds.  Stir continuously.
  
  Remove ingredients from the pan, add more oil, if necessary, and the
  squid. Cook for 30 seconds.  Return peanuts, garlic and chiles to
  pan. Immediately add all but 1 Tb of the stock, soy sauce and
  cilantro.
  
  Continue stir-frying for another minute.  Add cornstarch mixture.
  When sauce thickens, remove from heat and serve.
  
  [Score squid diagonally at three quarter inch intervals.  Turn and
  repeat at right angles to original cuts.  Don't cut all the way
  through the squid body.  Cut each scored squid body into three or
  four pieces.
  
  When cooked, the squid will roll up and the crosshatching will catch
  and hold the sauce.  It's much easier to do than to describe.  S.C.]

      Title: Strawberry Meringue Pudding
 Categories: Australian, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This is an Australian recipe circa 1950 (cakes and puddings always
  were Australia's forte) which deserves a revival.  At the time, most
  homes always had a supply of cake and biscuits on hand, so cake and
  biscuit crumbs were a by-product which needed a use.  Nowadays you
  will probably have to buy a plain cake to obtain the crumbs.  The
  recipe is hardly for weight-watchers but, even so, is quite low in
  fat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 190C.  Hull 3 cupfuls of strawberries and slice
  them into an oven dish.  Sift over them half a cup of icing sugar.
  Heat one cup of milk.  Separate 2 eggs, beat the yolks and stir into
  the milk off the heat.  Add 1 cup of cake or sweet biscuit crumbs and
  spread the mixture over the strawberries.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile beat the 2 egg whites until stiff then fold in 4
  tablespoons of castor sugar.  Remove the pudding from the oven and
  pile this meringue on top of it in peaks, or swirls.
  
  Bake in a slow (130C) oven for 15 to 20 minutes.

  This is a relatively simple one.  From the picture in the book, the
  lobsters are Australian rock lobsters or spiney lobsters.  They're
  much smaller that our Maine lobsters.  This probably fits the bill
  for the "New" Hong Kong cuisine in that it uses butter and milk.  I'd
  think this would probably be quite good made with Dungeness crab as
  well as lobster. Establishment: The Regent Hotel (Hong Kong)
  Salisbury Road, Tsimshatsui, Kowloon.
  
  Chef: Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award ++ Seafood
  STUFFED LOBSTER TAILS (12 servings) Chef: Ip Wah (The Regent Hotel)
  
  The literal translation, "Healthy and Spirited Dragon and Horse"
  cannot convey the symbolic values of the poetically rhyming Chinese
  characters. In the Cantonese dialect, a lobster is a "dragon shrimp"
  and the word for "horse" sounds similar to part of "water chestnut".
  Both creatures summon up images of power, stamina, elegance and other
  desired virtues.
  
  To prepare: 1. Soak and wash dried scallops. Shred and deep-fry until
  crisp, and put aside for garnish. If using red pepper, chop finely. 2.
  Remove lobster shells.  Retain tails and clean.  Set aside enough
  uncooked lobster meat required for stuffing, and dice it fairly
  finely. Chop remaining lobster meat into small square chunks. 3.
  Prepare cornstarch mixture, mixing well.
  
  To cook: 1. For Portuguese sauce, heat butter over low flame, add
  flour, then rest of sauce ingredients.  Cook into a paste, set aside.
  2. For stuffing, saute ingredients in a little oil over low flame.
  Add Portuguese sauce.  Remove from heat and when cooled, stuff into
  lobster tail shells. Brush exposed stuffing with egg, sprinkle with
  bread crumbs. 3. Heat until smoking, sufficient oil for deep-frying,
  lower flame, and immerse stuffed lobster tails (stuffing facing
  upwards) for 5 minutes, or until golden. Remove from wok.
  (Alternatively, bake unbread-crumbed stuffed lobster tails in a hot
  oven for 3 to 5 minutes, until surfaces are dry. Brush with egg and
  coat with bread crumbs, bake again until golden.) 4. For lobster meat
  chunks, heat wok, add 4 to 5 cups of oil.  When oil is at medium heat
  add lobster meat and blanch to seal in the juice. Remove lobster.
  Clean and reheat wok with 1/2 cup oil, and stir-fry lobster with
  diced water chestnut (or celery) and cornstarch mixture for 1 minute.
  
  To present: 1. Place stir-fried mixture in centre of platter, and
  sprinkle shredded dried scallops (or chopped red pepper) over. 2.
  Arrange lobster tails in a circle around it.

 Categories: Ground beef, Original, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Frozen ground beef
      1    Package corn tortillas
      2    To 4 cloves of garlic,
      2 md Yellow onions or 1 huge one
      2    To 22 hot chilies
      1 lg Block of cheddar cheese
      2    Or 3 tomatoes
           Head of iceburg lettuce
           Olive oil and peanut oil
           Salt
 
  I've decided to share++at long last++the only two recipes I can call
  my own.  Both these were developed before I really knew how to cook,
  in times of poverty (which seems to come and go with alarming
  regularity). They're good and cheap, an unbeatable combination.
  Here's number one... Copious quantities of ice cold beer is the best
  accompaniment for this. This dish is a truly international one and
  bears little resemblance to anything from either Sweden (I'm part
  Swedish++hence the name) or Mexico. The inspiration is Mexican, the
  utensils and some of the techniques used are Chinese, the ingredients
  are all-American (with the exception of the tortillas). It's "peasant
  food" in the best tradition++ cheap, full of flavor, healthy and
  satisfying.  I cooked these so often that I got to where I could
  knock out a complete, filling dinner++even with the frozen
  hamburger++in less than half an hour.  Follow the recipe closely++ at
  least the first time to see what it's s'pposed to taste like. I've
  never had anyone dislike this recipe, with the possible exception of
  a vegetarian or two. Slice and dice first.  Put everything into
  separate serving dishes as you cut 'em. Smash the garlic cloves,
  remove the skins and mince coarsely. Chop the onions into pieces
  about a quarter to half an inch square. Dice or slice the hot
  chilies.  Grate the cheddar on the side of the grater with the big
  round holes.  Cut the tomatoes into chunks about the same size as the
  onions or a little larger.  Shred the lettuce finely++ into strips
  maybe 1/8 inch wide. The essence of this dish is textured savoriness.
  The sharp cheddar, hot chilies, and yellow onions all contribute
  without overpowering one another. The tomatoes, besides adding a nice
  acidy zing, also give moisture. But the key to the savoriness and to
  the unique taste of the dish lies in the first two steps involving
  the garlic, onions and hamburger. Cheap hamburger is used because it
  has a high fat content and lots of taste. I've made this with chopped
  sirloin and the like and believe me, the result is definitely
  inferior to using the cheap stuff. Now that you've got everything
  sliced, diced and chopped you can start cooking. Actually, I usually
  do these first couple of steps prior to doing most of the cutting.
  That speeds things up a bit. Heat a wok over high heat and put in a
  nice dollop of peanut oil++ about 2 tablespoons or so.  Let it heat
  for a minute then toss in the minced garlic, followed a second or two
  later by about 2/3rds of the chopped yellow onion++the rest goes on
  the table, raw.  Right about now, it's gonna start smelling good in
  the ol' kitchen.  Stir the onions and garlic and reduce the heat to
  medium.  Take the frozen hamburger out of its wrapping and put it in
  the wok as is.  Smoosh it down and push the onions and garlic out of
  the way so the surface of the frozen hamburger is in contact with the
  hot surface of the wok.  If you haven't already whacked up everything
  else, now's the time to get on that. As the hamburger browns, scrape
  off the done surface with a slotted spoon or spatula of some sort.
  This goes on during the whole cooking time. Flip the block of meat
  over and scrape off the browned bits.  Let the other side brown a bit
  then repeat the process.  The idea is to brown both the onions and
  the garlic well. Big no-no's, I know, but I was young and ignorant
  and what did I know. As it turns out it was a happy mistake. The
  browned onions and garlic give an nice sharp, distinctive savoriness
  to the finished dish. I salt the meat periodically while it's
  cooking. The reason for using frozen hamburger is that when it's all
  finally cooked, you'll have bits of meat ranging all the way from
  well done and crunchy to nearly raw. This gives a very interesting
  texture and deepens the range of tastes. You may need to lower the
  heat under the wok toward the end to avoid over cooking the meat. And
  the bits will all be steeped in the wonderful juices from the cooking
  onions and garlic.  Sometimes I drain the meat at the end of cooking,
  sometimes I don't.  It depends on how fatty the meat is. These should
  have taste, but not be grease- burgers. You should be through
  chopping the rest of the stuff about the time the meat gets done.
  Now's the time to tackle the tortillas.  I prefer soft tortillas over
  the deep fried, crunchy shells. I use an old, cast iron griddle that
  fits over two burners. I heat the griddle over a medium fire, then
  pour a bit of olive oil onto it. This doesn't add any taste, but the
  aroma while the tortillas are cooking is heavenly!  I warm two
  tortillas at a time, flip them over and let them cook a bit more.  As
  they're done, I put them on a plate covered with pot lid to keep them
  warm. Soon as the tortillas are done, put everything on the table in
  the individual bowls and dig in. Everyone assembles their own tacos
  according to their tastes. My method is to put on a layer of
  meat++not too thick, then a layer of the chopped hot chilies, a layer
  of cheddar, a layer of chopped raw onions, then tomatoes and finally
  a layer of iceberg lettuce.  Just before folding I anoint the whole
  mess liberally with Tabasco sauce.  I've also used Jamaican
  Pickapeppa sauce and it's quite good on these too.  Season with salt
  during assembly if you like. The finished dish is an incredible
  medley of tastes and textures, each distinct and flavorful, with at
  least two distinct kinds of hotness. Great food that you eat with
  your fingers. What could be better?

      Title: Sweet and Sour Pork (Goo Lo Yuke)
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Pork butt cut into 1-inch
           -pieces

MMMMM-----------------------MEAT MARINADE----------------------------
      1 tb Sherry
      2 tb Water
      2 tb Kikkoman soy sauce
      4 ts Flour
      4 ts Cornstarch
      1    Green pepper, cut into 1/2
           -inch chunks
      1    Onion, cut into wedges
     12    Maraschino cherries
      1 c  Canned lichee
      1 c  Pineapple chunks

MMMMM-----------------------SAUCE MIXTURE----------------------------
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Vinegar
      1 ts Salt
      4 tb Catsup
    3/4 c  Pineapple juice
      4 ts Cornstarch
 
  Had a house guest last week++an old friend who likes my Chinese
  cooking, but tends to prefer the tamer stuff++you know, things
  without tentacles or feet.  So I whipped up a batch of this
  excellent, quick and easy sweet and sour pork.  It's a long time
  favorite that I haven't cooked for a some time.  Been too busy with
  Thai and Vietnamese food to make it. It was just as excellent as I
  remember it being and I actually improved on it with a couple of
  substitutions.
  
  I used 1/2 cup palm sugar instead of 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Palm sugar
  has a rich, complex and addicting taste while being a little less
  cloyingly sweet than regular sugars.  It gives a taste that's
  "exotic" without being obvious.  Where the recipe calls for 3/4 cup
  pineapple juice I used 3/4 cup of the juice from some brandied
  peaches I made.  I made 'em months ago and froze the leftover juice
  specifically to use in a sweet and sour dish. (This is a good thing
  to do with any sweet fruity type juice.)
  
  I left out the maraschino cherries++bleechhhhh!++and substituted a
  red bell pepper for the color contrast.  The only thing even faintly
  exotic in the recipe is the canned lichees (also a good juice to save
  for sweet and sour stuff) and that can be omitted if you can't find
  them++or use canned apricots or whatever instead.  You could also use
  longans or rambutans, which are close relatives of lichee, quite
  successfully.
  
  Yield: 6 servings
  
  PREPARATION:  Drain fruits, prepare sauce mixture.  Marinate pork in
  meat marinade for 1/2 hour.
  
  COOKING:  Deep fry pork cubes in a wok for about 3 to 4 minutes until
  golden brown.  Drain.  Pour all the oil back into the bottle.  Add
  sauce mixture into wok and stir until thickened.  Add green pepper
  and onions and cook for 2 minutes.  Add pork cubes and stir until
  heated through. Add fruits and stir until they're coated with the
  sauce.
  
  DO-AHEAD NOTES:  Cook through making the sauce.  Just before serving,
  add pork, vegetables and fruit according to directions.

      Title: Sweet and Sour Tofu
 Categories: Thai, Vegetarian, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    375    Tofu, drained
    1/4 c  Oil
      1    Clove garlic, sliced
    200    Green beans, sliced
      1    Onion, sliced
      1    Carrot, sliced
    200    Broccoli, chopped
      1    Stick celery, sliced
      2    Green shallots, chopped
      1 tb Tamarind sauce
      1 tb Fish sauce
      2 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Sweet chilli sauce
      1 tb Tomato paste
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb White vinegar
    1/4 ts Ground star anise
      1 ts Cornflour
      1 c  Water
 
  Been thinking about the problem getting the tofu to come out crispy.
  
  The only thing I can think of is that maybe the oil isn't hot enough.
  
  You are deepfrying the cubes, aren't you?  Another trick you might
  try is to double fry them.  Do 'em all once, let 'em cool a bit then
  refry them. Anyway++here's a couple of recipes for you to practice
  on.  They're from the Ozzie cookbooks Mark brought over.  BTW,
  "shallots" refers to scallions rather than what we call shallots.
  
  1:  Cut tofu into 1 1/2 cm cubes.
  
  2:  Heat oil in wok, add garlic, cook for 30 seconds, remove and
  discard garlic.  Add tofu to wok in batches, stir-fry gently until
  lightly browned; remove from wok.
  
  3:  Add beans, onion and carrot, stir-fry until vegetables are almost
  tender.  Add broccoli, celery and shallots, sauces, paste, sugar,
  vinegar and spice, stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Stir in tofu with blended
  cornflour and water; stir-fry gently until sauce boils and thickens
  slightly.
  
  Makes 6 servings.
  
  Best made just before serving.  Freeze: Not suitable.  Microwave: Not
  suitable.

      1 c  Mixed dried fruit, diced
  1 1/4 c  Water
      2 ts Of vanilla
      1 tb Peanut oil
    1/2 c  Whole almonds
      4 tb Butter
    1/3 c  Thinly sliced onion
    1/3 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
      3 c  Cooked rice
        pn Salt
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
 
  Here's an unusual use of the wok.  I don't usually think of fried
  rice and fruit going together...
  
  Soak the dried fruit in the water with 1 teaspoon of the vanilla for
  40 minutes.
  
  Heat the oil in a wok; add almonds and stir-fry until toasted, about 1
  minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon.
  
  Reduce the heat to moderate and add 2 tablespoons of the butter.
  
  Add the onions and stir-fry until lightly browned.
  
  Add 1/4 cup of the sugar and continue to stir-fry until the sugar is
  melted and lightly caramelized.
  
  Add 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon and the dried fruit mixture.  Stir-
  fry for 1 minute.  Remove to a bowl.
  
  Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the wok; add rice, remaining
  vanilla, sugar and the salt.  Stir-fry until rice is in separate
  grains and some grains have toasted lightly.
  
  Push the rice up the sides of the wok and pour the fruit in the
  center. Mix in the rice.
  
  Turn out onto a platter and decorate with the toasted almonds.
  
  Sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon mixed with cloves.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: Sweet Indian Lemon Pickles
 Categories: Indian, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      9    Lemons
      4 tb Coarse or kosher salt
  1 1/2 tb Cumin seeds,toasted, ground
      1 tb Coarsely ground black pepper
      3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Seedless raisins
      8    Dried, hot red peppers
 
  This is remarkably similar to the Moroccan Salted Lemon recipe that
  I'm looking for, except that it uses sugar instead of salt. Adapted
  from Julie Sahni's "Classic Indian Cooking."
  
  Wash the lemons in cold water and dry thoroughly.
  
  Quarter 6 of the lemons from the top almost all the way through to the
  bottom, leaving about 1/2 inch so they'll hold together.  Squeeze the
  juice from the other lemons.
  
  Mix the salt, cumin and black pepper in a small dish, and mix
  thoroughly with the lemons, Stuff the lemons into a quart jar and
  pour in the lemon juice.
  
  Cover with cheesecloth to prevent dirt from getting in the jar, and
  let sit in the open for about 1 week.
  
  On the 7th day, pour the juices from the jar into an enamel or
  stainless steel pan, add the sugar and cook over low heat, stirring,
  until the sugar dissolves.  Add the lemons and cook, stirring gently,
  for 8 minutes or so. Stir in the raisins and peppers.  Put the lemons
  in a sterilized jar and seal with the lid.  Let sit for a week or so
  before eating. Use like you would any pickle, as an accompaniment.

 Categories: Pies, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lg Sweet potatoes
      4 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar
    1/2 c  Milk
      3    Eggs, separated
    1/4 ts Salt, or to taste
    1/8 ts Grated nutmeg, or to taste
    1/2 ts Cinnamon, or to taste
    1/4 ts Ground cloves, or to taste
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
           Prepared pie crust (see
           -below)

MMMMM------------------------FLAKY PASTRY-----------------------------
      2 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Cold lard or vegetable
           -shortening and
           Cold butter or margarine
      3    To 5 tablespoons cold water
 
  In this very accommodating pie, the amount of sweet potato used need
  not be exact.
  
  1.  Preheat oven to 375F.  Pare sweet potato, cut in half lengthwise,
  then cut each piece once crosswise, and drop into boiling water to
  cover. Boil until tender (15 to 20 minutes).  Meanwhile, cut butter
  in small chunks and place in a medium mixing bowl with sugar.
  
  2.  Drain sweet potato and quickly mash with butter and sugar. While
  mixture is still hot, beat until smooth.  Beat in milk and egg yolks.
  Add salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla; carefully adjust
  spicing to taste.
  
  3.  Using an electric mixer with clean, dry beaters, beat egg whites
  in a small bowl until stiff.  Gently fold beaten whites into sweet
  potatoes. Pour mixture into pie crust, place on a baking sheet, and
  bake for 40 minutes.  Lower heat to 350F and bake until top is medium
  brown and crust is golden brown (an additional 5 to 10 minutes).
  Serve at room temperature or chilled.
  
  Serves 8.
  
  VARIATION:  For the more familiar, heavier pie filling, omit milk,
  and beat whole, unseparated eggs into the sweet potato mixture.  Bake
  at 375F for 40 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  FLAKY PASTRY:
  
  1.  In a large bowl mix flour and salt.  Using a pastry blender or 2
  knives, cut in lard and butter until mixture is crumbly and particles
  are the size of small dried peas.
  
  2.  Mixing lightly with a fork, sprinkle on water, 1 tablespoon at a
  time, until dough begins to cling together.  With your hands press
  dough into 2 flattened balls of equal size.  Enclose in plastic wrap
  to prevent dough from drying out while preparing filling.  To avoid
  stickiness, refrigerate for up to a day.
  
  3.  Roll out on a lightly floured surface, using short, firm strokes
  to achieve uniform thinness, according to recipe directions.
  
  Makes two 9-inch pie crusts.
  
  NOTE:  To prepare in food processor, combine flour and salt in work
  bowl. Add lard and butter.  Process, using short on-off bursts, until
  coarse crumbs form.  Add water through feed tube, 1 tablespoon at a
  time, processing until mixture barely clings together.  Use your
  hands to press pastry together into 2 smooth balls.

      Title: Sweetbreads (Animella Di Vitello)
 Categories: Italian, Veal, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  I was looking through an Italian cookbook for an Alfredo sauce (no
  luck there) and ran across a section on sweetbreads.  Here's a short
  run down on what they are, how to prepare them for cooking and three
  recipes. Veal sweetbreads are more tender and flavorful than any
  other variety and are the type most commonly found in American
  markets.
  
  Sweetbreads are very similar to brains in texture and flavor.
  However, they are somewhat less delicate, and the receive the same
  preliminary preparation and generally the same cooking treatment.  A
  whole sweetbread is the thymus gland of the animal and consists of 2
  nodules, or lobes, of which the more rounded is the tenderest and
  best part.  This choicer lobe is sometimes available separately,
  although it is more expensive.
  
  If sweetbreads are to be sauteed or broiled, first soak them in
  several changes of cold water for 2 hours.  Drain and carefully
  remove as much as possible of th membrane that covers them, being
  careful not to dig into the tender flesh.  Soak them again in cold
  water acidulated with lemon juice or vinegar and again remove was
  much of the membrane as possible. Cut off the connective tubes and
  then blanch the sweetbreads over low heat for 15 minutes in lightly
  salted water acidulated with lemon juice (about 1 tablespoon of lemon
  juice to 1 quart of water).  The water should be maintained at a
  point just below a simmer; do not boil. Drain and plunge them in cold
  water for 5 to 10 minutes.  They are now ready to be sliced and
  sauteed.
  
  Sauteing is the more popular method of cooking sweetbreads.  If,
  however, they are to be braised, blanching them is not necessary.

      Title: Szechwan Cucumber Salad
 Categories: Chinese, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 salad
 
      2 tb Small dried wood ear
           -mushrooms
      2    Cucumbers
      4    Red hot peppers cut in thin
           -rounds
      2 ts Light soy sauce
      2 tb Chinese white vinegar
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Sesame oil
 
  Pour boiling water over tree ears; let stand for 15 minutes.  Peel
  cucumbers, cut in half lengthwise, scrape out seeds.  Slice into thin
  half-moons.  When mushrooms are soft, drain, rinse and dry.  (Slice
  'em if they're too big.  Wood ears will quadruple in size when
  soaked++SC.) Combine with remaining ingredients.  Let stand for 15
  minutes then toss again before serving.
  
  NOTE:  (Wood ears can be found in Chinese markets.  After soaking
  they have little taste but lots of crunch.  They're there for the
  texture.  I can't think of anything to substitute (maybe raw carrots
  or water chestnuts) except for dried duck web or jellyfish and you're
  much more likely to find wood ears than those items.  Be sure to use
  the dark, cooked, Asian sesame oil rather than the light stuff in
  health food stores. I'd make this before the ribs and chill it well
  while doing the rest.)

  The Parsis, a tiny ethnic group displaced in ancient times from
  Persia to India, have a distinctive cuisine.  Some years ago, Perviz
  Parakh, a member of the Parsi community in Melboume, published a
  booklet con- taining this recipe.
  
  Finely chop 2 large onions and fry in 3 tablespoons of oil until
  golden brown.  Add to the onions 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1
  teaspoon chilli powder, 1/2 teaspoon of ground turmeric and salt to
  taste.  Stir to mix and continue to cook for a few minutes.  Chop 1/2
  kg of ripe tomatoes and 1 green chilli and finely chop a bunch of
  fresh coriander. Add them to the onion mixture and cook until the
  tomatoes are done and there is not too much juice left in the pan.
  Add 2 tablespoons brown vinegar and 6 teaspoons brown sugar and cook
  5 minutes longer.
  
  Transfer the tomato mixture to a lightly greased gratin dish (or 6
  individual gratin dishes).  Smooth the surface and make 12 hollows
  with the back of a spoon.  Slide an egg into each hollow.  Bake the
  dish in a preheated 180C oven for about 25 minutes or until the egg
  whites are set.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Yield: 3 servings
 
      5 c  Pork stock [Chicken works
           -just fine. S.C.]
    1/2 c  Minced or ground pork
      1 tb Chopped garlic
      3 tb Fish sauce
    1/2 c  Tapioca
    1/2 c  Cooked or canned crab meat
           Pepper

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      4    Lettuce leaves, coarsely
           -chopped
     12    Coriander leaves
 
  Tapioca is a plant product made from the roots of the cassava plant-
  ~also called manioc.  It's a major product in Thailand and I saw
  "tapioca trees" all over the place.  The plant itself isn't a tree,
  but they take the rootstocks and tie them into bundles which they set
  upright in the fields so they don't rot during the rainy season.
  Leaves sprout from the top of the bundle and the whole thing looks
  like a tree.  The root has a poisonous acid in it that has to be
  removed by cooking.  Those little balls are actually made++like
  risotto or "rice pasta".  It's usually used to make sweet puddings
  here, but in the Orient it's used to make thick, savory soups.  Like
  this one!
  
  Heat the stock to simmering in a large pan.  Pour 1/2 cup of the hot
  stock into a bowl and stir in the pork.  Return mixture to the pan.
  Add the garlic and fish sauce to taste, then add the tapioca and cook
  for 5 to 10 minutes.  When the tapioca is clear, add the crab meat
  and season to taste with pepper.  Remove from the heat.  Line
  individual soup bowls with the lettuce.  Pour in the soup and
  sprinkle with coriander leaves.

      Title: Ten Foods You Should Never Eat
 Categories: Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  As an eating machine I'm driven far more by taste than by nutritional
  considerations. After all, one of my all time favorite dishes is Tung
  Po Pork, a Chinese concoction that consists mainly of pork fat and
  skin that is stewed in spices then steamed for several hours. That's
  why I was surprised to find myself interested in a flyer I got from
  The Nutrition Action Healthletter.  Maybe it was the title that
  caught my interest. Here are some excerpts from the flyer. 1. Quaker
  Oats 100% Natural Cereal. This overrated granola cereal's ten g of
  fat per half cup serving make it high in fat compared to other
  cereals. And, despite the crunch, it's not high in fiber.  A much
  better choice would be a low fat, whole-grain cereal like Kellogg
  Nutri-Grain Wheat, Post Grape-Nuts, General Mills Wheaties, or
  Nabisco Shredded Wheat. 2. Contadina Alfredo Sauce. A typical four
  ounce serving contains 34 grams of fat++20 of them artery-clogging
  saturated fat. That's like drowning your pasta in more than a third
  of a stick of butter If you want a good bottled pasta sauce, try
  Enrico's Spaghetti Sauce No Salt Added, Tree of Life, or Colavita. 3.
  Nissin Chicken Cup O' Noodles. It will give you a surprisingly strong
  shot of fat (about 3 teaspoons' worth) and almost as much sodium
  (1,700 mg) as you should ideally eat in a whole day.  Try The Spice
  Hunter Quick and Natural Soups instead. A serving averages just half
  a teaspoon of fat and 200 mg of sodium++a much healthier alternative.
  4. Taco Bell's Taco Salad with Shell. With the shell, this platter of
  beef, cheese, and beans has 14 teaspoons of fat, more than 5
  teaspoons of saturated fat, and 905 calories. That's almost all the
  fat and saturated fat an adult should eat in an entire day. If you're
  in the mood for a fast food salad, head to McDonald's. Its Chunky
  Chicken Salad contains a single teaspoon of fat and 1/4 teaspoon of
  saturated fat. 5. Swanson Great Starts Scrambled Eggs & Sausage with
  Hash Browns. This measly 6 1/2-ounce breakfast will slap you with
  more than half the fat you should eat in a day.  And Swanson won't
  even say how much saturated fat and cholesterol it contains.  You'd
  be better off skipping breakfast entirely. For a healthier microwave
  morning, have a Healthy Choice English Muffin Breakfast.  At just one
  teaspoon of fat per serving and 15 to 20 mg of cholesterol (it
  contains egg whites, not yolks), it's a far "healthier" choice. 6.
  Oscar Mayer Lunchables. It would be hard to invent a worse food than
  these combos of heavily processed meat, artery-clogging cheese, and
  mostly white-flour crackers. The line averages 5 1/2 teaspoons of fat
  (that's 55 percent of calories) and 1,517 mg of sodium. You'd get
  less fat and salt from two slices of Pizza Hut's Pepperoni Pan Pizza.
  7. Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream.  Gourmet ice creams like Haagen-Dazs and
  Ben & Jerry's are loaded with grease.  A one-cup serving has as much
  artery-clogging saturated fat as 1/4 cup of lard.  Choose an ice milk
  like Breyers Light and you'll cut the fat by 75 percent.  Buy
  Sealtest Free or Edy's or Dreyer's Fat Free and you'll get rid of
  almost all the fat. 8. Campbell Chunky Soups.  They're brimming with
  salt.  An average 9-ounce serving contains 975 mg of sodium.  That's
  half your quota for an entire day. If you're looking for more than
  salty water, check out Pritikin Soups. A cup has 160 mg of sodium and
  less than one gram of fat. That's a bit less fat-and far less sodium
  than you'll find in Campbell's Healthy Request or ConAgra's Healthy
  Choice Soups. 9. Swanson Hungry Man Turkey Pot Pie. If you think that
  turkey products are always lower in fat than foods made with beef or
  pork, you're wrong. Crammed into a single pie are 650 calories, 36
  grams of fat, and 1,470 mg of sodium. That makes it worse than
  Swanson's Hungry Man Beef Pot Pie. 10. Stouffer's Entrees. Despite
  their popularity, Stouffer's en- trees get a greater percent of their
  calories from tat (440 percent than any other major line of frozen
  dinners or entrees. Not one of Stouffer's 52 varieties meets our
  criteria for a "healthy" frozen meal. If you want low-sodium, low-fat
  frozen meals, try Tyson Healthy Portions, Healthy Choice Dinners, or
  Le Menu New American Healthy. From the Nutrition Action Healthletter,
  1875 Connecticut Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20009. The only vegetables
  we found in an entire Banquet Vegetable Pie with Chicken were twelve
  peas, 1/11 of a carrot, and 1/12 of a potato. And in a Lean Cuisine
  Glazed Chicken with Vegetable Rice, you'll find just 1/3 of a
  mushroom, 1/2 ounce of green beans, and a teaspoon of onions. That's
  it for vegetables! Need more whole grains in your diet? Don't count
  on Wheatsworth Stone Ground Wheat Crackers, with less than half a
  tablespoon of whole- wheat flour in four crackers. And Prego's "made
  with Fresh Mushrooms" Spaghetti Sauce has only about half a mushroom
  per serving ... that's three mushrooms in the whole jar! This
  newsletter appears to be a culinary Consumer's Guide with products
  reviewed by brand name along with "healthy" recipes (they cite
  Indian, Mexican and Asian recipes) and general tips for eating
  "healthy". The thing I got was a special promo++ten months of the
  newsletter for ten bucks or 17 bucks for 20 issues. As a bonus you
  get a couple of charts. One is called "Chemical Cuisine" and lists
  various food additives along with their relative safety. The other is
  a "Nutritional Scoreboard" that lists foods along with their relative

 Categories: Mexican, Veal, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  This Mexican dish is an excellent way to use difficult cuts like the
  breast of veal and any ragged chops.
  
  Put the veal complete with bones into a saucepan and add the knuckle
  of veal or any other veal bones you may have saved.  Add 1 onion, a
  clove of garlic, several sprigs of fresh coriander and water to just
  cover.
  
  Simmer gently, covered, for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours until tender.
  
  Since this part of the operation requires almost no effort, it is a
  good idea to do it while cooking dinner the night before and
  refrigerate the meat in the stock overnight so that the fat can be
  easily removed (the breast is the fattiest cut) before proceeding the
  next night.
  
  Remove the cooked meat from the stock and bone it, discarding the
  bones. Strain the stock and set aside.  Wash out the saucepan.
  
  Into a food processor with processing blade, put 3 birds-eye chillies,
  seeded and roughly chopped, 1 onion, quartered, several cloves of
  garlic, 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 2
  tablespoons of red wine vinegar and a little salt.  Process to a
  paste.
  
  Put a little olive oil into the saucepan, heat it and fry the
  processed paste gently, stirring, for a few minutes.
  
  Add about 300 ml of the stock or enough to obtain a sauce
  consistency: Add the cooked meat to the sauce and simmer gently for
  about 15 minutes longer. Correct the seasoning it necessary:  and
  serve with rice or rice and beans.
  
  Serves 3 to 4.

  In Thai cooking, a pounded paste fresh coriander roots, black pepper
  corns and garlic makes a popular and useful spice mixture.  This Thai
  trio-spice paste is used in the same way as Italian pesto to season
  stuffings, smear over meats as a marinade, or saute in oil to flavor
  stir-fried dishes. In this recipe, it serves to flavor the stuffing.
  
  Soak the bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.
  
  Keep the coriander bunch tied together and rinse it in a pan of cold
  water by dunking it up and down to dislodge the sand.  Drain
  thoroughly and spin dry in a lettuce drier.  Cut off the roots,
  including about 1 inch of the stem above the root; chop coarsely and
  set aside.
  
  To make the spice paste, pound the pepper corns in a mortar, or grind
  in a spice mill Add the garlic, coriander roots, sugar and salt;
  pound or grind into a smooth paste.
  
  Combine the spice paste, fish sauce, coriander leaves and chicken.
  
  Mix well.
  
  To devein and butterfly the prawns, make a 1/2 inch deep cut through
  the shell along the back with kitchen scissors.Pull out the black
  vein (the alimentary canal).  Rinse prawns under cold running water
  and dry thoroughly.
  
  Starting from the tail end, thread the prawns lengthwise onto the
  skewers, ending at the head end.  Spread open the 1/2-inch deep cut
  and stuff with about a teaspoonful of chicken paste; smooth the
  surface.
  
  Repeat with remaining prawns.
  
  Lightly brush prawns with oil.  Grill over a medium-hot fire for 1 to
  2 minutes on each side, or until they turn bright orange and feel
  firm to the touch.  They may also be broiled.  Serve with Sweet-Sour
  Cucumber Salad.
  
  SWEET AND SOUR CUCUMBER SALAD:
  
  Combine the vinegar, sugar , salt and water in a small bowl; stir
  until sugar and salt dissolve.  Put the cucumber slices in a shallow
  bowl, sprinkle with shrimp powder and fish sauce, then pour in the
  sweet vinegar to cover.  Top with coriander leaves.

  Cut the fruit into bite-sized pieces.  If using pomelo, peel the
  individual sections and break them apart into grains about the size
  of a grape seed. Toss apple or pear slices in a little citrus juice
  to keep them from oxidizing.
  
  Using a small skillet or saucepan, heat the oil over low heat and
  gently fry the shallot and garlic in it until lightly browned.
  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Discard the oil or reserve it for
  another use.
  
  Combine the lime juice, salt and sugar (if used) in a medium bowl and
  stir to dissolve.  Add the fruits, shrimp and half the garlic and
  shallot: toss to coat evenly with dressing.  Taste for seasoning and
  adjust if necessary. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with the
  remaining garlic and shallot, peanuts and chile shreds.

      6 oz Cooked bay shrimp
           Shredded lettuce
      1 tb To 2 tb crisp-fried shallots
           -(optional)
 
  This recipe comes from the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, location of the
  Thai Cooking School.  It has been adapted for the American cook. With
  this recipe it's necessary to use mung bean glass noodles rather than
  those based on rice flour.  Check the ingredients on the package when
  buying.
  
  Put mung bean noodles in a bowl and pour in lukewarm water to cover.
  Let soak until soft and pliable (about 15 minutes).  Drain.  Add
  noodles to a large pot of boiling water. reduce to medium heat; cook
  until noodles are plump and glass like (3 to 5 minutes).  Drain in a
  colander; rinse with cold water; drain again.  Cut into 3 or 4 inch
  lengths.
  
  Chill.
  
  Pour oil into a hot wok or skillet.  Add chicken; saute until it
  loses it's pink color.  Break into small morsels.  Season with salt
  and pepper to taste.  Cool.
  
  Mix together chile, lime juice, nam pla, sugar, shallots and
  coriander; pour over noodles and mix thoroughly.  Add chicken, shrimp
  and chilled noodles; mix well.
  
  Serve on a bed of shredded lettuce.  Garnish with the optional crisp
  fried shallots.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  NOTE:  Crisp fried shallots are available in Asian grocery stores.
  
  San Francisco Chronicle, 8/29/90.
  
  As far as the crisp fried shallots go, they're easy to make.  Just
  fry some sliced shallots in a little oil until they're browned and
  crisp.  I wouldn't hesitate to substitute dried onion flakes fried in
  the same way... I add them to a lot of Thai soups for an extra flavor
  accent. Good stuff!

  A few extra chillies would give this salad a lot more punch. This Thai
  recipe transforms the familiar leftovers into a thoroughly Asian salad
  perfect for hot days.
  
  Finely shred 1/2 a Chinese cabbage.  Grate two carrots.  Cut 1
  capsicum into thin strips.  Shred 300 g cooked chicken meat and
  finely slice 100 g ham.
  
  Make a dressing by combining:
  
  1 birdseye chilli, finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic crushed 2
  tablespoons lime (or lemon), juice 2 tablespoons dark soya sauce 1/2
  cup of flaked almonds, lightly toasted
  
  Bring a large pot of water to the boil and have ready a sink full of
  icey-cold water.  Plunge the shredded cabbage into the boiling water
  for one minute then scoop it out and into the cold water.
  
  Drain and dry the cabbage and arrange it and the other vegetables in
  sections or concentric rings for maximum decorative value on a large
  serving dish.  Fill the centre of the arrangement with chicken and
  ham.

  [The chilli "flowers" can be easily made by slitting long, thin, hot
  chillies lengthwise from near where the stem attaches and then
  tossing the slit chillies into a bowl of ice water and ice cubes.
  The "petals" will curl back and make an attractive garnish.  Make
  about eight slits. S.C.]

      Yield: 3 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This recipe is very simple,very fast and very good.  The fresh rice
  noodles, thick and white, can be found in the refrigerator cabinet of
  any good Asian grocery store.  Don't use frozen marinara mix++the
  recipe deserves better.  Any decent fishmonger will be happy to serve
  you with half a dozen prawns, a few scallops, some squid, a small
  fillet of fish, a handful of mussels or any other combination that
  appeals to you.
  
  Cut 500 g of mixed seafood into bite-size pieces, first removing any
  shells.  If you are using mussels, wash and scrape the shells and
  open them by putting them in a pot with a little boiling water.
  Cover and boil for a few minutes, removing each mussel as it opens to
  prevent overcooking.
  
  Chop a handful of basil leaves and seed and finely slice 3 bird's eye
  chillies.
  
  In a frying pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of oil.  Brown 2
  tablespoons of crushed garlic and saute the seafood for a couple of
  minutes. Drain off the oil and set the garlic seafood mixture aside.
  
  Put another tablespoon of oil in the pan and increase the heat.  Add 2
  tablespoons of light soya sauce and the noodles and saute for 2-3
  minutes. Tip the seafood back into the pan and add 3 tablespoons of
  fish sauce. Stir well.  Add the basil leaves and chillies and cook
  for 1 minute more, stirring.  Serve,
  
  Makes 3 to 4 servings.

      Title: Thai Simmered Chicken
 Categories: Thai, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Chicken (4 to 5 pounds)
           Salt
      2 qt Water
      3    Stalks fresh lemon grass
      8 sl Fresh galangal (or fresh
           -ginger)
      6    Garlic cloves, smashed
      6    Fresh Thai "bird" chiles *
      8    Shallots, sliced
      6    Fresh kaffir lime leaves
           -(optional)
    1/4 c  Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
    1/2 c  Tightly packed fresh
           -coriander leaves
    1/4 c  Fresh Thai basil leaves,
           -cut into thin strips
      1 ts Black pepper
 
  * (or 4 Serranos), cut into coarse strips, seeds and all.
  
  Salt the chicken inside and out and let stand for 30 minutes to an
  hour.
  
  In a pot the chicken will fit in snugly, bring water to a boil.  Add
  the chicken and when the water returns to a boil, skim the foam. Cut
  off the bottom 1/3 of the lemon grass stalk, discarding the rest. Cut
  the bottom on the bias into oval slices and add to the pot along with
  the galangal, garlic, chiles, shallots and kaffir lime leaves (if you
  can find them).
  
  Turn the heat to medium-low, partially cover the pot, and simmer for
  30 minutes.  Then add the fish sauce, sugar and up to 2 teaspoons of
  salt (or to taste).  Simmer until the skin near the wing starts to
  split, about 30 more minutes, then remove the chicken to a large,
  round serving bowl leaving the stock in the pot.  Cover the chicken
  to keep warm.
  
  Add the lime juice to the broth as well as the coriander and basil
  leaves. Pour the broth over the chicken, sprinkle with the black
  pepper and serve.
  
  The chicken should pull off the bone easily; it's best eaten from
  bowls with some of the broth and herbs poured over.

  Is there a cuisine which doesn't have a version of stuffed tomatoes?
  The filled vegetables are always good but this Thai interpretation is
  quite different.
  
  Cut the tops off 10 tomatoes and set them aside to be used later as
  lids. Scoop out the seeds and internal flesh of the tomatoes, leaving
  the fleshy shell.  Lightly salt the interiors and stand the tomatoes
  upside down in a rack to drain.
  
  Pound in a mortar or process together the well-washed roots of a
  bunch of coriander, 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 onion and 10 peppercorns
  (better use coarsely ground pepper if processing).  Remove this
  mixture to a bowl and add 250 g minced pork, 250 g cooked crab meat
  (tinned can be used if necessary), 1 teaspoon sugar, 2 tablespoons
  fish sauce and 1 egg. Mix well rinse out and dry the tomato cases,
  stuff with the mixture and replace the lids.  Bake in a preheated
  180C oven for half an hour.

  Thailand is truly a place for seafood lovers.  There is water
  everywhere in Bangkok++even in the dry season.  And everywhere there
  is water, the Thais use it to grow something to eat!  Add to that the
  fact that the Gulf of Thailand is not far away from the city and it
  all adds up to good eatin' for seafood lover's!  The following recipe
  is typical of the bewildering variety of cioppino and jambalaya type
  seafood stews found there++and each one seems better than the last.
  The recipe is from Joyce Jue's delightful San Francisco Chronicle
  column (3/13/91).  It calls for the dish to be cooked in a Chinese
  "sandy" pot.  Don't gots one? Not to worry++use whatever you have on
  hand++wok, Dutch oven, stockpot...
  
  (And yes, Marge++there are tentacles in this!)
  
  Put the mung beans into a bowl and cover with warm water; soak until
  soft and pliable, about 10 minutes.  Drain.  Set aside. If you are
  using a cooked crab, have the fishmonger crack it into large pieces.
  
  To clean a live crab, be careful, and use a brush to scrub its
  underside and between the claws and legs to loosen the sand and grit.
  Rinse thoroughly with cold water.  Plunge the crab into boiling water
  for a minute to kill it.  Remove.  When cool, clean, disjoint and
  chop the crab into large chunks.
  
  In a mortar or spice mill, pound or grind the peppercorns first, then
  add the coriander root and garlic, and work it into a paste.  Mix
  together the sugar, Golden Mountain, soy and oyster sauces, rice wine
  and sesame oil in a bowl.
  
  Pour the vegetable oil into a 3 1/2-quart sandy clay pot casserole
  (or a Dutch oven) and set over medium heat.  Add the
  coriander-garlic- pepper paste and saute lightly.
  
  Increase the heat to high.  Add ginger, chiles and raw crab pieces;
  toss and brown for a minute.  Add the shrimp an green onions to crab
  mixture; stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Pour in the soy sauce mixture and
  mung bean noodles; toss and mix together.  Stir in the water, cover
  pot, reduce heat to medium and braise for 8 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. If the noodles seem dry, add more water.
  
  Increase heat to medium-high, and gently stir in the fish and squid
  (and cooked crab if using), mix with the noodles, top with the basil
  leaves. Cover and cook for 3 to 5 minutes longer.  Check for
  doneness. Garnish with fresh coriander sprigs.  Bring the clay pot to
  the table and serve hot with rice and vegetables.

      Title: The Care and Feeding of Woks
 Categories: Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Wok Information
 
  This should answer all your questions about the care and feeding of
  woks.
  
  A Wok That Can Rust Is a Wok Worth Cleaning by Joyce Jue
  
  Recently, a reader wrote asking if he should throw out his rusty wok
  and start with a new one.  Keep it!  An old wok that can rust is a
  wok worth owning.
  
  Unless the cooking surface has deep pits from rust, a wok can be
  cleaned and reseasoned.  It should stir-fry better than when it was
  new.
  
  Wok Talk:
  
  Why an I writing about woks again?  Because the "rusty wok" question
  is the one I'm most frequently asked, followed by:  How do you season
  a----wok??
  
  If you want to feel like a Chinese cook and produce dishes that taste
  authentically Chinese, I highly recommend using a carbon spun-steel
  or thin iron wok for stir-frying.  Both require initial seasoning,
  but regular use will maintain the seasoning and eventually produce a
  shiny black patina finish.
  
  Chinese cooks are persnickety about their woks.  It takes time, care
  and lots of cooking before a wok develops a patina that almost
  impervious black coating found on well-used woks.  The ultimate goal
  is for the wok to impart wok hay, an elusive pan flavor and aroma
  that is associated with Chinese restaurant dishes.
  
  Actually, wok hay comes from cooking over extremely high heat in a
  well-seasoned pan.
  
  Finely Tuned Implement:
  
  Once a wok imparts wok hay, it is respected like a finely-tuned
  instrument.
  
  A well-seasoned wok is almost non-stick.  I often stir-fry vegetables
  using just a thin film of surface oil.
  
  As the patina builds up, less cooking oil is required.
  
  A wok is quite sturdy.  It stands up to high heat better than any
  other cooking pan.  It seems impervious to being banged or battered -
  I have accidentally dropped mine down four flights of concrete stairs
  and it came through intact with patina unscratched.
  
  A wok's worst enemies are soap and scouring pads - they'll remove any
  seasoning the wok has acquired.
  
  Until a wok takes on a shiny, smooth, black patina, the initial
  seasoning must be strengthened by frequent use of the pan, and
  fortified by an occasional light re-seasoning.
  
  There is no shortcut to achieving a perfectly seasoned wok.  It comes
  from use.
  
  Seasoning: To season a new carbon spun-steel wok or to re-season an
  old rusty wok, thoroughly scrub it inside and out with soap and a
  steel wool scouring pad to remove the manufacturer's protective
  coating on a new wok, or the rust on an old one.  Rinse thoroughly
  with hot water.  Some manufacturers apply a coating that is hard to
  remove, so set the wok on the stove, fill it with water and boil it
  for several minutes until the coating dissolves.  Pour out the water
  and scrub the surface clean with steel wool and soap.
  
  Set the clean wok over high heat.  Heat until a few drops of water
  sprinkled into the wok immediately turn into dancing beads.  While
  the pan is heating, it will change from shiny steel gray to blue,
  purple, red and, finally, black.
  
  Dip several sheets of wadded-up paper towel into peanut or corn oil
  and wipe the oil on the entire inside surface of the wok (you may
  want to use long-handled tongs to hold the towels).  Reduce heat to
  low and let the wok sit over the heat for 15 minutes to absorb the
  oil - the color changes will continue and, hopefully, the bottom of
  the wok will darken. In time and with frequent use the entire wok
  will turn black. if the surface looks dry, wipe with another thin
  film of oil.  Remove wok from the burner and let it cool.
  
  Reheat the wok and repeat the oiling and heating process once more
  before using it for stir-frying.

      Title: The Dreaded Haggis
 Categories: Scottish, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Sheep's stomach
      1    Sheep heart
      1    Sheep liver
    1/2 lb Fresh suet (kidney leaf fat
           -is preferred)
    3/4 c  Oatmeal
      3    Onions, finely chopped
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/4 ts Cayenne
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    3/4 c  Stock
 
  Here's a recipe for the dreaded haggis.  The book notes that, in
  addition to the other naughty bits, the lungs are traditionally
  included in Scotland, but are omitted here as it's illegal to sell
  lungs in the U.S. (Any clues as to why, anybody?).  Some folks also
  think that liver shouldn't be used...
  
  Wash stomach well, rub with salt and rinse.  Remove membranes and
  excess fat.  Soak in cold salted water for several hours.  Turn
  stomach inside out for stuffing.
  
  Cover heart and liver with cold water, Bring to a boil, reduce heat,
  cover and simmer for 30 minutes.  Chop heart and coarsely grate liver.
  
  Toast oatmeal in a skillet on top of the stove, stirring frequently,
  until golden.  Combine all ingredients and mix well.  Loosely pack
  mixture into stomach, about two-thirds full.  Remember, oatmeal
  expands in cooking.
  
  Press any air out of stomach and truss securely.  Put into boiling
  water to cover.  Simmer for 3 hours, uncovered, adding more water as
  needed to maintain water level.  Prick stomach several times with a
  sharp needle when it begins to swell; this keeps the bag from
  bursting.  Place on a hot platter, removing trussing strings.  Serve
  with a spoon.
  
  Ceremoniously served with "neeps and nips"++mashed turnips, nips of
  whiskey and mashed potatoes.

  This is another "not what it appears to be" dish.  The main part looks
  kinda like a sea anemone.  It's garnished with whole, boiled sea
  urchins++a nice touch.  You should be able to find the sea urchin roe
  at a Japanese grocery.  Remember the "shallots" called for are
  probably green onions.
  
  Establishment: Hotel Riverside Plaza Tai Chung Kiu Road, Shatin, New
  Territories. Western Cuisine Practical Class Gold Award - Hot Fish
  Dish Chef: Chow Kwok-ting, Phil (Hotel Riverside Plaza)
  
  To prepare: 1. Slice salmon and garoupa fillets into thin squares
  about 9 to 10 cms wide and 3 to 4 mms thick. Each ball needs two
  slices of each fish. (Do not attempt to make them all exactly the
  same width, as the subsequent moulding process is easier if the
  layers of fish diminish in size.) Season with salt and pepper.  .
  
  2.  Blanch lettuce leaves by dipping in hot water, then refresh in
  iced water.  Cut into squares of similar diminishing dimensions as
  fish slices. Each ball needs four lettuce squares.
  
  3.  Pile up alternating layers of fish and lettuce, starting with a
  bottom layer of salmon, then lettuce, garoupa, lettuce, salmon,
  lettuce, garoupa, and a final layer of lettuce.  Place a dot of sea
  urchin or lobster roe (optional)
  
  4.  Lay each pile on a piece of cling wrap about 20 cms square.
  Moulding upwards from the bottom layer, form each pile into a ball.
  Wrap it firmly, twisting a knot at top of cling wrap to hold moulded
  ball in shape.
  
  To cook: 1. To make sauce, reduce white wine with chopped shallots to
  thickness of essence.  Add fish stock and reduce again.  Add fresh
  cream, and remainder of sea urchin or lobster roe (optional).  Strain
  sauce, add salt and pepper and a few drops of lemon juice.  Stir in
  butter and lobster coral (or paprika).  Keep warm.
  
  2.  To cook artichokes, bring a pan of water to the boil.  Add some
  lemon juice drops, salt, a little plain flour and whole baby
  artichokes, and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove artichokes and
  discard green outer leaves.  Carefully peel off purple-tinted inner
  leaves, trim them uniformly and set aside.  Cut white artichoke
  bottoms so that they have flat bases.
  
  3.  (Optional) Boil sea urchins, adding a little vinegar or lemon
  juice, oil and salt to pan.  (Please note that the very prickly
  urchins must be handled with care!  Although they are edible
  garnishes, special eating tongs are recommended!)
  
  4.  Heat fish stock.  Simmer wrapped balls for about five minutes,
  remove pan from heat and leave aside for 1 to 2 minutes.  During
  simmering prepare the presentation plates as below.
  
  To present: 1. Pour sauce onto plates (forming the "sea")
  
  2.  Place two artichoke bottoms on each plate , laying two layers of
  trimmed artichoke leaves around each bottom.
  
  3.  Remove fish balls from stock and make three cross-wise inci-
  sions on top of each.  (Cling wrap will fall away, and cut "blossoms"
  reveal their layers and "pollen' of sea urchin roe.) Lifting it clear
  of its cling wrapping, place one fish ball on each artichoke bottom.
  
  4.  Add watercress and cooked sea urchin (or alternative garnish) to
  each plate.

      Title: The Fragrance of Pork (Tungpo Pork)
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  1 1/4 lb Belly pork in one piece
      2    Level tablespoons salt
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Wine
      2    Spring onions (scallions)
      2 sl Ginger
 
  The following passage is from "Chinese Gastronomy", one of the best
  books on Chinese cuisine I've ever seen.  It beautifully expresses
  the nearly metaphysical regard that the Chinese have for food and
  eating and is delightful reading even if you never cook a single
  recipe from it. This dish is incredibly good, considering that its
  main ingredients are pork fat and skin.  The fat is not something to
  be gotten rid of in this case. It's treasured for what it is.  Like I
  said, this is something that I don't cook often but it's a special
  occasion when I do.
  
  This is one of my all time favorites.  I serve it with a bowl of
  Chinese mustard and a bowl of chopped green onions for dipping.
  
  At one time the butcher shops of Soochow were variously called Genuine
  Straw Mat, Original Straw Mat, Old Straw Mat, etc., just because
  there is a story about an Immortal in disguise who flung a bit of mat
  into a pot of belly pork to give it a special fragrance.  The
  fragrance is easy enough to produce.  What is important is that it
  stands out in a clear field. Instead of being heavy, the pork should
  appear light; clean instead of messy; smooth instead of lumpy.  The
  flavour of pork is effusive. While the cooking of chicken and beef
  means the careful carving out of its best flavour from the raw
  material, the flavours of pork must be restrained. At its best, pork
  is tender, sweet, fragrant, tasty, rich without being oily (in other
  words, nun, hsien, hsiang, nung, yu-er-pu-ni).
  
  A geometrically precise square of belly pork is stewed and then
  steamed in a little sauce, so that it is served with an absolutely
  clear layer of melted fat overlying a smooth brown sauce.  The
  surface is a rich brown colour, the fat smooth and custard-like, the
  meat brown and tender. The square of fat was named after Su Tungpo,
  the poet, for unknown reasons. Perhaps it is just because he would
  have like it.  The square of fat is regarded with much passion,
  tenderness and expectation.
  
  Second-rate versions of it appear everywhere, differing from the
  following version by their failure to clear the field for the
  delicacy of the pork fat which, if prepared accordingly, tastes fresh
  and clean like fresh (sweet) butter.  In order to keep the flavour
  clear, the meat is first salted to remove the bloody juices, blanched
  to remove the scum, then stewed very slowly, and finally steamed for
  hours to tenderize the fat slowly.  Inferior versions this are made
  by stewing pork for a few hours without steaming it...  The result is
  lumpy fat.  If the salt rub and blanching are omitted the juice
  becomes messy and lumpy.  The simplicity of appearance, smoothness
  and clarity of flavour have to be wrested from the manifold flavours
  of pork.
  
  Tungpo Pork is customarily served at the end of a meal with bowls of
  rice. People sigh, shout and groan with happiness when they see it.
  
  This is one of the pinnacles of gastronomy, and sums up the
  application of fat in Chinese cuisine.
  
  Trim pork into a precise square.  Wash it and wipe it dry with a
  towel. Rub it with salt and let it stand for about 2 hours.  Discard
  the blood-tinged liquid.
  
  Bring 5 pints (12 cups) water to a boil and blanch the meat in it.
  Rinse it free of scum and repeat the blanching with a fresh portion
  of boiling water.  Place the pork skin side up in a pot with a
  tight-fitting lid, adding soy sauce, wine, spring onions ginger and 2
  tablespoons water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to very
  low and simmer for 2 hours, adding a little more water if necessary.
  Keep the amount of liquid as small as possible, and do not keep
  uncovering the pot to see how the pork is progressing.  Let it stew
  in its own juices.
  
  Discard the spring onions and ginger.  Place the square skin side
  down on a dish of soup plate dimensions, add the juices and cover it
  very closely with foil, cellophane or an overlapping plate.  Steam it
  for 4 hours, until the fat is tender and can be cut with a spoon.
  Invert the square so that the fat is uppermost, and pour the juices
  around it carefully.

      Title: The Tahitian Oven
 Categories: Tahiti, Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Information
 
  The Tahitian stuff is basically pretty simple fare, but it requires
  all sorts of Tahitian veggies, fruits along with fish that I can only
  find in pet stores around here.
  
  There are some inconsistancies and maybe an incongruity or two in the
  definition and spelling of the regional ingredients.  I copied them
  directly out of the book, so tain't my fault.  Most of these terms and
  names have all the strange little marks over the vowels++much like
  written Vietnamese.  I haven't even attempted to replicate those.
  
  The preparation of a ahima'a [Polynesian oven and its contents]
  requires a considerable amount of work and time.
  
  As most Tahitians nowadays have regular employment, they can seldom
  spare the time to cook in this manner and the tama'ara'a [meal]
  around the traditional ahima'a is generally reserved for week-ends or
  special occasions.
  
  To prepare for about 40 people, the hole in the ground should measure
  around 3 m long by 2 m wide by 0.80 m deep.
  
  Line the bottom of the oven with dry wood placed crisscross to
  facilitate the fire.
  
  Completely cover the wood with a layer of volcanic stones.  Light the
  fire and allow it to burn out almost completely, until the red hot
  stones remain in the bottom of the oven.  Cover these with some green
  branches and a bed of green banana leaves.  Season the pig and
  chicken and lightly baste with oil before placing them on the bed of
  leaves, together with all the other ingredients such as crayfish,
  fish, vegetables, bananas and breadfruit, all wrapped individually in
  leaves.
  
  Cover the food with several layers of banana leaves, then a layer of
  damp sacks before shoveling back enough sand or earth to fill the
  oven.
  
  Allow to cook for at least 3 hours.
  
  The opening of the ahima'a is quite a ceremony among Tahitians and
  all the guests usually assemble to witness the spectacle.  It is
  surprising to find that all the ingredients are almost invariable
  cooked to perfection, the pork usually has a golden crust and the
  different dishes, despite having been cooked together in the same
  oven retain their particular odour and flavour.

  The tama'ara'a comes of course after the ahima'a.  It is the meal at
  which one eats what has been cooked in the ahima'a, together with the
  traditional raw fish, raw and cooked freshwater shrimps, raw and
  cooked crayfish, the mao'a [turbot] and the pahua taioro [clam
  marinated in juice of grated coconuts, seawater and shrimps], the
  mao'a or pahua with re'a [ginger], the miti [salt] hue [calabash],
  the miti ha'ari [coconut or coconut milk], the popoi [manioca or
  breadfruit paste], and of course the famous fafaru [fish marinated in
  seawater], the smell of which is always a little shocking to an
  outsider.  The usual drinks are beer, punch, red wine and water. Both
  for the preparations of the ahima'a and for serving the tama'ara'a,
  the Tahitians use traditional bowls, the 'umete made of wood. Some are
  beautifully decorated and are used to prepare the po'e [starch and
  stewed fruit preserve], the marinated raw fish, etc...
  
  Other kitchen utensils are; the penu or pestle, made in stone or
  coral; the hue or calabash, used to keep the mite hue or fafaru; the
  'ana or coconut scraper++though nowadays metal-pointed scrapers have
  replaced the traditional coral instrument, now only found in
  old-fashioned households.
  
  The tama'ara'a is not just a meal.  It has all the characteristics of
  a feast in the country and no effort is spared to make the table and
  the surroundings as colorful as possible, with plants, fruits and
  flowers.
  
  Each guest is received with great attention and is crowned with
  flowers; the tiare tahiti, the tipanie, the fara [pandanus]. On the
  ground or on a table covered with banana leaves (green ni'au [coconut
  palms]) the crockery is laid out; 'umete, hue, bamboo cups, green
  coconuts and split emptied coconut shells.  Tradition demands that
  the ma'a [food] tahiti be eaten with the fingers and therefore no
  cutlery is laid out.
  
  A tama'ara'a is always a happy occasion.  The family meets, friends
  come together, and everyone is gay.  There is music of course,
  because in Polynesia a meal starts and ends with singing.  A small
  orchestra is improvised (all Tahitians are amateur musicians) with
  guitars, ukelele and bass.  (This bass is a unique instrument; it is
  built with a 20 litre oil-drum, a broomstick an a string tying one to
  the other, and the sounds are obtained by plucking the string.)
  Punch, beer and red wine contribute to the gaiety.

  Here are three recipes for flavored oils for various uses.
  
  ROASTED RED PEPPER OIL:
  
  Puree 1/2 cup roasted red peppers (homemade or commercial).  Stir
  into 2 cups oil.  Let stand at room temperature until color and
  flavor are pronounced, about 1 week.  Strain and refrigerate.  Use
  for dressings or drizzled over pizza, pasta and shrimp.  Lasts about
  6 months.
  
  Makes a little over 2 cups.

  BASIL OIL:  From John Ash.
  
  Blanch a bunch of basil (this will keep it bright green) and dry
  well. Put in blender or food processor and add oil to cover well.
  Blend and put in jar.  Allow to settle; strain.  Keeps refrigerated
  for 10 to 12 days. For using decoratively, put in little plastic
  squirt tubes.

  fat (1 g saturated), 0 mg cholesterol, 0 mg sodium, 0 g fiber.
  
  CHILE OIL:  From "From Pantry to Table, " by Mark Spieler.
  
  Pour 1 cup oil over 2 tablespoons crumbled small hot dried chile
  peppers or red pepper flakes, depending on heat of peppers and your
  own taste. Some chiles (such as bird's eye) are incendiary and need
  to be used sparingly. For more pronounced flavor, gently heat the
  chile oil. A bay leaf or two may be added.  Drizzle onto pot stickers
  along with soy sauce and a strong, sour vinegar.
  
  Makes 1 cup.

      Title: Tips for Perfect Roast Chicken
 Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Here are several techniques that help to add flavor to roast chicken.
  
  Before roasting, lift the skin of the breast and leg sections by
  sliding your fingers under it, then seasoning the meat underneath.
  This accomplishes several things.  First. it puts the flavorings
  directly on the meat where they will do the most good.  Second, for
  diners who remove the skin before eating, this ensures that the
  seasoning will not be stripped away with the skin.  Finally, it gives
  easily scorched ingredients, such as fresh herbs or minced garlic,
  protection from the drying heat of the oven. In addition to
  seasonings, rub a bit of oil under and over the skin. This helps to
  flavor and moisten the meat, and insures that the skin will crisp
  well during roasting.
  
  Start roasting chickens breast-side down in a hot oven (at least
  400F). This crisps the back and gives the thickest part of the thighs
  a head start in cooking. Then after 30 minutes or so, reduce the oven
  temperature, turn the chicken over, and stuff, baste or sauce it, the
  continue roasting until done. The roasting times may seem a bit long
  by recent cookbook standards.
  
  Of course. doneness is a personal choice, but I don't want to ever
  carve into a chicken with a rosy pink breast and jiggling thighs.  I
  prefer chickens roasted to between 170F and 175F. At this
  temperature, the breast may be a bit dry (white meat begins to lose
  moisture after 165F), but the dark meat will be cooked through.

      2 lg Packages (8 oz. each)
           -neufchatel or cream cheese
           -at room
           Temperature.
    3/4 c  Sugar
      4 lg Eggs
      1 c  Light or regular sour cream
      2 tb Orange-flavored liqueur *
      1 ts Vanilla
           Crust (recipe follows)
           Orange Sauce (recipe
           -follows)
      1 lb (about 1 large) firm-ripe
           -mango
           Fresh mint (optional)
           * (or 1/2 teaspoon grated
           -orange peel)
 
  This is heaven!  Probably the best cheesecake I've ever tasted.  I
  cheated on the crust++just used a pre-made graham cracker crust from
  the market and it worked just fine.  I used Grand Marnier for the
  orange liqueur. Thank God this is nice and low-cal!  ;-}
  
  In a large mixing bowl, beat cheese and sugar until creamy.  Add
  eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add sour cream,
  liqueur and vanilla; beat until blended.  Pour over crust.  Bake in a
  325F oven until center of cake jiggles only slightly when gently
  shaken, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool completely on a rack.  (If made ahead,
  cover and chill up until the next day.)
  
  Spoon about 1/3 of the lukewarm orange sauce over cheesecake, to
  within 1 inch of sides.  Peel mango.  Cut fleshy cheeks off each side
  of pit, then cut off remaining fruit.  Cut mango into thin slices 4
  to 5 inches long. Arrange over cheesecake, overlapping slightly.
  Spoon remaining sauce over fruit and cake to within about 1/4 inch of
  side.
  
  Cover; chill until sauce is set, about 30 minutes or up to 8 hours.
  Run a knife around inside edges of pan.  Remove pan rim.  Garnish
  with mint. With a sharp knife, cut cake into wedges.
  
  Makes about 12 servings.
  
  CRUST:
  
  Mix 1 1/2 cups finely crushed crisp coconut macaroon cookies with 1/4
  cup (1/3 pound) melted butter or margarine.  Press mixture over
  bottom and about 1 inch up sides of a 9-inch cheesecake pan with
  removable rim. Bake in a 325F oven until lightly browned, about 15
  minutes.
  
  ORANGE SAUCE: In a 2- to 3-quart pan, mix 3 tablespoons sugar and 4
  teaspoons corn starch. Stir in 2/3 cup orange juice and 3 tablespoons
  orange-flavored liqueur (or orange juice). Stir over high heat until
  boiling.  Cool to lukewarm.

  some veggies and crepe strips to fill in for noodles.
  
  Establishment: Hotel Riverside Plaza Tai Chang Kiu Road, Shatin, New
  Territories. Western Cuisine Practical Class Gold Award - Hot entree
  Chef: Chan Chi-hung Philip (Hotel Riverside Plaza)
  
  To prepare: 1. Precook wild rice as a pilaf with chopped onions,
  chicken stock, and appropriate amount of water. When cool, add grated
  Parmesan cheese and let mixture cool.
  
  2.  Cut chicken breast portions butterfly style (i.e. slice in half
  and spread open.  Flatten and slightly stretch them (by gently
  pounding them between two sheets of wax paper or inside a clean
  plastic bag. Season with salt and pepper.
  
  3.  Lay a cone-shaped portion of rice stuffing on one side of each
  flattened breast.  Roll chicken breast up in a cone shape.  Wrap each
  cone firmly in aluminum foil (to maintain shape during cooking:  the
  professional recipe calls for plastic foil wrapping, but aluminum
  foil is recommended for home cooking).
  
  4.  Blanch green leek stems, then refresh in cold water.
  
  5.  Make 4 very thin crepes about 20 cms wide (ingredients not
  included above).
  
  To cook: 1. Blanch pearled vegetables, celery and peas, then saute in
  approximately 10 g butter, adding salt and pepper according to taste.
  Keep a quarter aside.
  
  2.  To make sauce, reduce chicken stock and add fresh cream.  Cook
  briefly, then strain.  Add fresh lemon juice and finish with butter
  as required. Adjust seasoning and add chopped chervil according to
  taste.
  
  3.  Saute morels in approximately 10 g butter.
  
  4.  Heat some chicken stock (5 cups should be sufficient to completely
  cover the four wrapped chicken portions).  Simmer breasts in hot
  stock for approximately 7 minutes.  Remove from pan, discard aluminum
  foil wrappings, and saute in approximately 60 g butter until lightly
  browned. Then slice each into six portions, cut at an angle (30 to 40
  degrees).
  
  To present: Treasure Hunt takes the form of a chicken breast "boat",
  with morel oars being rowed towards crepe "treasure bag" of vegetable
  "precious stones" some of which have spilled on the shore.
  
  1.  Portion out 3/4 of vegetable pearls, celery and peas onto crepes
  lifting crepe edges upwards to form bag shapes.  Tie tops of bags with
  blanched green leek stems (with decorative knotted bows if stems are
  long enough).
  
  2.  Pour sauce onto plates.  Arrange chicken slices in a line on
  sauce, lay thick ends of morels between them.  Place a crepe bag on
  each plate, with reserved vegetable pearls laid beside bag.  Garnish
  with chervil sprigs (or watercress or parsley).

  Here are some more recipes from the Sydney Morning Herald, courtesy
  of Mark Herron.  What to do with leftovers is the subject of the next
  three posts.
  
  Turkey meat, which tends to be dry, benefits particularly from this
  macadamia dressing, but any roast poultry meat you have left over can
  be used instead.  Another soft lettuce can stand in for the rocket
  (arugula) if you simply can't obtain the latter, but it won't provide
  the delicate, savoury flavour.  Macadamia oil can now be obtained in
  some supermarkets.
  
  Wash and dry thoroughly: 1 bunch of rocket, discarding the coarse
  stem ends 1 small, soft lettuce
  
  Arrange the leaves on four plates.
  
  Heat 250 g macadamia nuts in an ungreased container in the oven until
  they smell appetizing, then set half aside and tip the other half
  into the bowl of a food processor.  Add:  2 garlic cloves, roughly
  chopped. With salt and pepper process to a paste.  With the food
  processor.running, slowly add 100 ml macadamia oil, then 50 ml white
  wine vinegar.
  
  Slice or shred enough turkey for four people and gently loss it in the
  macadamia salad.
  
  Arrange the dressed turkey on the prepared plates, drizzle left-over
  dressing over the salad leaves, Sprinkle with reserved macadamia nuts,
  roughly chopped, and finely chopped chives.  Serve.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  Remove heads, feet, giblets and excess fat from ducks.  Using poultry
  shears or strong kitchen scissors, remove tails and backbones; cut
  each bird in half through breastbone, then in quarters.  Rinse and
  pat dry. Prick all over with the tines of a fork.
  
  Combine herbs with salt and pepper and rub all over duck pieces,
  pressing well into skin.  Place quarters on a rack in a roasting pan,
  skin side up, and cook in a 300F oven for about 1 hour, until the fat
  has rendered into the pan - up to 2 or 3 cups.  Remove from oven but
  leave on rack to continue dripping for about 45 minutes.
  
  Start a charcoal fire (a covered grill is most efficient for this)
  and when coals are ready and spread, place duck quarters on rack,
  skin side down. Cover grill and cook 10 minutes.  Turn duck, cover
  grill and cook 15 minutes.  Reverse and cook skin side up for about 5
  minutes more, covered; serve immediately.

      Title: Types of Garlic
 Categories: Information, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  I buy garlic but never have paid much attention to the subtleties of
  it. Here's some interesting info on types and uses.
  
  HARDNECK GARLICS: These have a central flower stalk that hardens to a
  stem in the center of the garlic head. Tricky to grow and generally
  much less productive than "softneck" garlics, they are always more
  expensive.
  
  Examples include:
  
  ROCAMBOLE:  This is the most commonly planted specialty variety. The
  head is cone-shaped, with bright purple skin. The uniformly sized,
  wedge-shaped cloves are clustered radially around the central stalk.
  The cloves easily pop out of their papery skins.  It has a strong
  flavor but is rarely bitter.
  
  SPANISH ROJA:  Similar to the Rocambole, but with a rounded head and
  skin coloration that ranges from red to mahogany.  Grown most
  commonly in the Northwest.
  
  ITALIAN RED:  A generic name given to red-skinned, hardnecked garlics
  of several different varieties.
  
  SOFTNECK GARLICS: These do not have a central flower stalk. These are
  always used for braiding. These include:
  
  MEXICAN PINK:  A common variety grown in Mexico, it is characterized
  by cloves that splinter outwards from the main head, somewhat like
  leaves on an artichoke.  The flavor is often quite hot.
  
  EARLY and LATE CALIFORNIA WHITE:  This is the main garlic variety
  grown commercially in California.  It is very productive and is well
  adapted to growing in hot weather.  It has tight skins over both the
  cloves and the whole head, which help make this garlic one of the
  best keepers.
  
  ELEPHANT GARLIC:  A cross between garlic and onion.  The flavor is
  mild and the texture is similar to an onion.
  
  OTHER USEFUL TERMINOLOGY:
  
  GREEN GARLIC.  Garlic harvested before the bulb has matured and before
  skins have formed around the cloves.  It can be used like baby leeks.
  The flavor is mild but distinctly garlicky.
  
  FRESH GARLIC:  Juicy, mature garlic sold before the skins have set or
  dried.  This is perishable and susceptible to mold.
  
  CURED GARLIC:  Most garlic is cured for about a month to allow the
  skins to dry or set.

      Title: Vegetable Platter
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lg Head of Boston or other
           -soft lettuce, separated
           -into individual leaves
      1 bn Of scallions, cut into
           -2-inch lengths
      1 c  Coriander leaves
      1 c  Mint leaves
      1 c  Fresh Asian or regular

      1    Cucumber, peeled in
           -alternating strips, halved
           -lengthwise and slice
           -thinly crosswise
      4 oz Fresh bean sprouts
           Pickled shallots (optional)
 
  On a large platter, decoratively arrange all of the ingredients in
  separate groups.  Use in recipes where required.
  
  This is a basic thing in Vietnamese cuisine, served with all sorts of
  grilled foods.  Such uses of raw veggies herbs are one of the things
  about Vietnamese cuisine that makes it so fresh and appealing.
  
  Vietnamese meals include an abundance of fresh lettuce, herbs, unripe
  fruits and raw vegetables.  These are arranged attractively on a
  platter and are used for wrapping cooked foods at the table, usually
  dipped in Nuoc Cham and eaten out of hand.
  
  The following herbs, both very important to the Vietnamese, would be
  authentic additions to the Vegetable Platter:  One is the "saw leaf
  herb" (Eryngium foetidium), or ngo gai in Vietnamese), a coriander
  relative. The other is polygonum (P. pulchrum or rau ram in
  Vietnamese), with pinkish stems, pointed green leaves and purplish
  markings.  They can be found occasionally at Southeast Asian markets.
  If you have access to unripe mango, banana, papaya or apple and star
  fruit (carambola), add them to the platter.  You may select or
  substitute the ingredients according to availability and personal
  taste.
  
  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

 Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 appetizer
 
      2 oz (3 sheets) dried bean curd
      3 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Water
      1    Level teaspoon sugar
    1/2    Level teaspoon MSG
      1    Level teaspoon fennel

    1/2    Level teaspoons wild
           -pepper, crushed.
           -[Szechwan peppercorns S.C.]
 
  "The Buddhists, whether monks or ordinary people, mingled freely with
  the non-vegetarians, and because the manners of Chinese society are
  all-embracing and diffuse, felt obliged to provide food which looked
  and almost tasted like meat.  This was a sign of hospitality.  Their
  cuisine was based on nuts, spices, vegetables, sauces, sesame, peanut
  and vegetables oils, and bean curd.  The last was the factotum, now
  appearing as duck, then as chicken, then as fish.  Its very lack of
  personality made it an excellent actor."
  
  Soak the bean curd in water for about 1/2 hour until soft.  Mix
  together the remaining ingredients, and marinate the bean curd in
  this mixture for about 2 hours.
  
  Select the largest and smoothest sheet and lay it on a flat surface.
  Place the remaining sheets on top of it evenly, so that when rolled
  up it will form a cylinder of regular dimensions.  Roll it up VERY
  tightly. Place it on a single piece of cheese-cloth or old sheet and
  roll it up, with the cloth overlapping both at both ends.  Tie the
  bundle at both ends like a toy firecracker at the two points where
  the bean curd ends. Steam the roll for about 1 hour.  Cool the roll
  and unwrap it.  Slice the roll into 1/4-inch slices and serve cold.

  The next few recipes are from a big, fat cookbook that would be
  several volumes if they had not used the somewhat unappealing format
  in which the recipes are presented.  The book is pretty no frills,
  with little background given for the dishes.  Almost everything that
  I've tried from the book has been good, though.  Here we get into
  some hard- core, no-fooling Chinese vegetarian recipes.  The book has
  a lot of vegetarian stuff in it, as well as recipes tailored for
  diabetics and those with ulcer problems.  It's actually pretty easy
  to use once you get used to the odd format.

      Title: Vietnamese Chili Sauce (Dip)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      2    Dried red chilies
      2    Cloves garlic
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Fish sauce
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Mince chilies and garlic finely and place in a mortar.  Mash with the
  heel of a cleaver or pestle.  Add sugar and stir until it dissolves.
  Add fish sauce, vinegar and lemon juice, stirring between each
  addition. This makes enough for 2 to 4 people.  I almost always
  double the recipe just to make sure there's enough.  I've kept it for
  long periods of time but unless you freeze it, it's past it's prime
  after a few days. This is a basic chili sauce used for a dip for
  chicken or whatever.
  
  Variations of this are found in Cambodia, Thailand and other Southeast
  Asian countries.  You can fiddle with it endlessly.  This is a good
  starting point.  The proportions shown here produce what I consider a
  mildly warm dip.  I generally use two to six times as many chilies,
  depending on their strength and how hot I want it.
  
  Variations:  use green serrano chilies instead of dried red ones, lime
  juice instead of the lemon juice or palm sugar instead of granulated.
  If you make it in a food processor, don't over process.  It should
  have small chunks of each ingredient rather than being a homogeneous
  liquid.
  
  The taste is sour and hot, very puckery.  It's great with poached or
  steamed chicken, duck or game hens.  Much better with basically bland
  dishes rather than something like curry which has it's own blend of
  spices. Good with Chinese white-cut chicken or Steamed Ginger Chicken
  with Black Bean sauce.  It's truly addictive and I often serve it
  with meals that are not Oriental in origin.  Should be good with a
  firm- fleshed white fish or boiled shrimp or crab.
  
  Fish sauce is a liquid made with anchovies and salt.  It's not really
  fishy tasting.  Look for it in the oriental section of supermarkets
  or at markets catering to Asian clientele.  Tiparos is a good brand
  made in the Philippines.  I prefer Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce, but
  they'll probably be harder to find.  Chinese fish sauce is NOT a
  substitute.

      Title: Vietnamese Dipping Sauce
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiment, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Minced fresh pineapple
      3 tb Mam nem (anchovy sauce)
      2    Garlic cloves, crushed
      1    Fresh red chili pepper,
           -seeded
      1 tb Sugar
      3 tb Fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2 ts Rice vinegar or distilled
           -white vinegar
      3 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
 
  For anchovy lovers, here are a couple of variations for a Vietnamese
  dipping sauce made with 'em.  This is traditionally served with Beef
  Fondue with Vinegar (Bo Nhung Giam) that is part of the Vietnamese
  feast called Bo Bay Mon (Beef in seven ways++seven distinct ways of
  preparing beef). It's good with other stuff too but can be a bit
  strong to Western tastes. Some restaurants have it but you might have
  to ask for it. This is by far the most intricate of sauces in the
  Vietnamese culinary repertoire. What makes it so special is the use
  of a condiment called mam nem, prepared from ground fresh anchovies
  and salt and fermented over a period of time. It can become
  dangerously addictive. Traditionally, mam nem is served as a dipping
  sauce for barbecued or fried fish. In general it goes well with
  grilled foods.  It is an essential sauce fro Beef Fondue with Vinegar.
  
  Use only fresh pineapple and remember to shake the bottle of anchovy
  sauce thoroughly before using.  Anchovy cream may be substituted.
  
  Over a bowl, squeeze the pineapple between your hands to extract as
  much juice as possible.  Combine the pulp and juice and set aside.
  Into a bowl, strain the anchovy sauce through a very fine sieve,
  pressing on th solids with a spoon to extract all of the liquid.
  Discard the solids.
  
  Pound or crush the garlic, chile and sugar to a fine paste in a bowl.
  Stir in the pineapple mixture, strained anchovy sauce, lemon juice,
  vinegar an fish sauce.  Stir to blend.
  
  Yield: 1 1/3 cups
  
  VARIATION: If you are unable to find mam nem sauce, here is a
  variation of the above recipe, using canned anchovies. Add pineapple,
  if desired. 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 fresh red chili pepper, seeded
  2 tablespoons sugar 2 cans (2 ounces each) flat anchovies, drained
  1/4 cup nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce) 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2
  tablespoons pineapple or water
  
  Combine the garlic, chile and sugar in a mortar and pestle and pound
  to a fine paste.  Add the anchovies and mash to a very smooth paste.
  Stir in the fish sauce, lemon juice and pineapple juice.  Mix well.
  
  Yield: about 1 cup.

MMMMM-----------------ACCOMPANIMENTS FOR SERVING----------------------
           Basic Vegetable Platter
           Carrot Salad
           Double recipe of Nuoc Cham
 
  Here they are!  The incomparable "Cha Gio" or Vietnamese spring rolls.
  
  Yields 80 spring rolls.
  
  Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
  
  Cut a round rice paper sheet into quarters.  Place the cut rice paper
  on a flat surface.  With a pastry brush, paint the beaten egg over
  the entire surface of each of the pieces.  Before filling, wait for
  the egg mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes
  about 2 minutes. When you become adept at this, you can work on
  several wrappers at a time.
  
  When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 teaspoon of
  filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle.  Fold the
  sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll.
  
  After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying pan,
  put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate,
  and fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown.  (This is
  Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).
  
  To serve the spring rolls, proceed as follows:
  
  Arrange the ingredients for the vegetable platter (lettuce, mint
  leaves, coriander, and the cucumber slices) according to the
  directions preceding. Have ready the carrot salad and a bowl of nuoc
  cham.  Each person has a bowl into which he places a bit of lettuce,
  2 or 3 mint leaves, some coriander, and 2 cucumber slices.  Each
  person then adds 1 or 2 spring rolls to his bowl, sprinkles with the
  nuoc cham, and eats the spring rolls and vegetables together, using
  chopsticks or a fork.
  
  Additional carrot salad may be added to taste.
  
  Another very popular serving method calls for placing the vegetables
  on a lettuce leaf, adding the spring roll, and rolling it into a
  cylinder. Holding the cylinder with his fingers, each diner then dips
  it into his own small bowl of nuoc cham.
  
  NOTE:  We have found that frying the spring rolls in peanut oil keeps
  them crisper than frying in any other oil.

      3 tb Water
      1 tb Finely grated carrot
 
  Here's scanned recipe number two++another recipe for a perennial
  favorite, Cha gio or Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  I haven't tried this
  one yet, but it's from Joyce Jue, the SF Chron columnist and her
  stuff is usually bang-on.
  
  In 2 separate bowls, soak the tree ears and the bean thread noodles
  in warm water until soft and pliable, about 6 minutes.  Rinse tree
  ears and drain. Remove and discard any hard centers.  Coarsely chop
  and set aside, Drain the noodles and roughly chop into about 2-inch
  lengths; set aside.
  
  Mix together the pork, garlic, shallots, fish sauce and pepper.  Add
  tree ears, noodles, carrots and bean sprouts; mix together with your
  hands.
  
  Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce:  Combine garlic, sugar, lime juice, fish
  sauce, chile and water; let sit at room temperature for at least 10
  minutes, When ready to use, strain into a small bowl and add grated
  carrot. Makes 1/2 cup.
  
  To form spring rolls:  Combine warm water and sugar in a wide shallow
  pan (such as a cake pan).  Immerse 1 wrapper in the sugar water for a
  second and immediate immediately place it flat on the counter or on a
  wet, wrung-out, kitchen towel.  Let sit until it wrinkles and softens
  to a pliable skin, about 1 minute, sometimes longer.
  
  Using your hands, shape 3 tablespoons of filling into a tight compact
  log, about 1-inch in diameter and 4 to 5 inches long.  Place the log
  along the bottom third of the wrapper.  Roll the bottom edge over the
  log, then roll it over the filling once more.  Make sure the wrapper
  is taut around the filling.  Fold the outside wrapper edges inward to
  enclose the ends. Roll up to seal.  If there is a tear in the
  wrapper, bandage it with a soften softened rice paper remnant.
  
  Set rolls seam side down on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover
  with a damp towel.  Continue making the remaining rolls.
  
  To deep fry rolls:  Pour 2 inch inches of oil into a wok or deep-fat
  fry fryer.  Heat to 325F.  Add a few rolls at a time.  Do not crowd.
  Fry for 10 seconds.  Immediately increase heat to high (375F).
  Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 6 to
  8 minutes.
  
  Remove rolls to paper towels to drain.
  
  Serving suggestions:

      Title: Vietnamese Pork Burgers
 Categories: Vietnamese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Lean ground pork
      3    Garlic cloves, chopped
      2    Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Soy sauce
      2 ts Peanut or other mild
           -vegetable oil
        pn Sugar
           Few drops Tabasco sauce, or
           -pinch cayenne pepper
           Hoisin sauce
        lg Whole lettuce leaves
    1/2 c  Or so roasted peanuts,
           -coarsely ground
           Handful cilantro, coarsely
           -chopped
 
  This is typical of what is becoming known here as East/West cuisine,
  the flavors and ingredients of Asia presented in a Western form.  All
  these are from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 7/15/92.
  Each bite of these burgers packs a zesty wallop of flavor and
  texture. Good accompaniments are bland steamed rice or French bread,
  each of which balances these assertive flavors.
  
  Mix meat with garlic, onions, soy sauce, peanut oil, sugar and
  Tabasco or cayenne.  Form into patties and grill until cooked
  through. Serve each grilled patty spread with hoisin sauce, wrapped
  in a leaf of lettuce, sprinkled with peanuts and cilantro.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  NOTE: In the body of the accompanying article, the author suggests
  using pita bread lightly spread with hoisin and putting the patties
  into it along with some of the cabbage salad.  That's probably the
  way I'd go.

      Title: Wildfowl Stock
 Categories: Game, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 quarts
 
      3 qt Cold water
      5 lb Game bird carcass, wings,
           -legs, neck, other spare
           -parts
      2    Or 3 stalks wild celery,
           -cut in chunks
    1/2 c  Wild onions, chopped
    1/2 c  Wild carrots, chopped
      1 sm Bunch watercress
 
  Place cold water in a soup pot.  Place game bird pieces in cold
  water. Soak for 1 hour.  Add other ingredients.  Do not stir.  Soak
  for 1 hour. Place pot, uncovered, at the back of a cook stove far
  from the fire. On a conventional stove, place the pot on an asbestos
  pad over very low heat.
  
  Allow pot and it's contents to warm very slowly.  You need to draw as
  much as possible out of the ingredients and into the stock.  Skim off
  scum as it rises.  When the pot is uniformly warm, move it closer to
  the fire (or increase the heat) and very slowly and carefully bring
  the liquid to a simmer.  Do not boil.  Do not rush.  Skim off all the
  scum immediately, as it rises within the first 30 minutes of
  simmering.  After 30 minutes and after skimming, use a clean piece of
  cheesecloth to wipe the pot at the level of the liquid.
  
  Simmer very gently, uncovered, for at least 3 hours.
  
  Taking great care not to disturb the ingredients, carefully ladle the
  liquid through clean, moistened cheesecloth into a large screw-lid
  jar. Do not pour the stock.  Leave the unstrained stock uncovered
  until cool. Cover cooled stock tightly and store in refrigerator.  Do
  not remove grease at this time.
  
  Skim grease from stock.  Reheat for use, or freeze.
  
  This is from the cookbook on wild foods.  I've copied as it's written
  because I found the style of writing and ingredients interesting. If
  you try to use wild ingredients, be careful.  I seem to remember that
  both wild onions and wild carrots have close relatives that look much
  the same but are toxic.  Personally, I'd do my stalking at the
  supermarket.

      Title: Willie's Crisp
 Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 9 servings
 
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg, beaten
      5    To 6 cups peeled, seeded,
           -sliced fruit, or stemmed
           -berries
    1/2    To 3/4 cup sugar
      2 tb Flour
    1/4 lb Butter, melted
 
  I love cobblers, crisps, etc., but never make them.  This one may
  change my mind.  What can you say about a recipe that starts like
  this?
  
  "...When I called her, she read me the recipe from a small black cook
  that contains, she says, the recipes that have no peer, the benchmark
  recipes. Willie's Crisp is part of this collection, and although I
  have no idea who Willie is, I do know that his is the only crisp I've
  ever had that was crisp. It is perfect on top of fruit or berries."
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F. Have ready an 8 x 8-inch baking dish (no
  need to butter it). Put 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, the baking powder
  and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir to mix well.  Make a well in
  the center of the dry ingredients and add the beaten egg. (Don't add
  the egg now unless you are going to bake this right away. The sugar
  will begin to melt, and the mixture won't crumble and spread
  properly.) Stir mixture with a fork.  It should be crumbly; if it
  seems too dry, add a little more egg. Put the fruit or berries into
  another mixing bowl.  Stir together the 2 tablespoons flour and sugar
  to taste. Add to the fruit and toss lightly to coat. Spoon fruit into
  the baking dish and spread evenly.  Sprinkle the crisp mixture evenly
  over the top. Drizzle the melted butter evenly over the crisp
  mixture. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the topping is golden.
  Serve warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

  heat and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes or until berries are softened.
  Remove vanilla bean and cinnamon stick.  Spread mixture in thin layer
  on bottom of tart shell. (Leftover marmalade is good served on side
  with smoked meat, fowl or curry.)
  
  In a bowl, combine pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg,
  cloves and pepper.  Beat in eggs, cream, half and half and bourbon,
  Pour into pastry shell.  Bake at 375F for 30 to 40 minutes or until

      Title: Won Ton Soup (Won Ton Tong)
 Categories: Chinese, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     30    Won ton filled according to
           -won ton recipe
      1 c  Roast pork, sliced
      1 qt Chicken and pork stock [Or
           -either one. S.C.]
      2    Stalks green onions, minced
      1 ts Sesame oil [The dark,
           -cooked Oriental type. S.C.]
 
  You can fiddle with the ingredients to your hearts content.  Roast
  pork is available at Chinese markets and you could probably get it to
  go at Chinese restaurants.  Or try meat from good ol' American BBQ
  ribs, slivered. Or thinly sliced raw chicken.  Or thinly sliced
  shrimp or scallops. Or no meat at all...
  
  Yield: 4 servings
  
  PREPARATION:
  
  Prepare won ton filling and wrap as in won ton recipe.  Heat stock.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Bring a pot of water to a boil.  Add won ton and boil for 4 to 5
  minutes. Remove won ton with bamboo skimmer or slotted spoon and
  transfer to soup bowls.  Garnish with roast pork and green onions.
  Pour heated stock over won ton.  Drizzle sesame oil over won ton and
  serve.
  
  DO-AHEAD NOTES;
  
  Wrap and freeze won ton.  Drop frozen won ton directly into boiling
  water and boil for 5 to 6 minutes.
  
  COMMENTS:
  
  Unless you're Chinese you probably don't know what won ton means.
  "Won" means cloud and "Ton" means swallow.  Since won ton wrappers
  are light and fragile as clouds, biting onto won ton is like
  swallowing a cloud.

      Title: Working with Saffron
 Categories: Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  Pulled out my saffron book, which I hadn't really looked at closely,
  and discovered that it was written by a local gal.  And is
  autographed to boot. Sat down at my scanner and it was so interesting
  I could hardly get up. There's a lot of historical stuff, but I
  thought you might be interested in what it says about countries
  propagating and selling the corms++Japan, the Netherlands and
  *Oregon, USA*!  This first post is about how to prepare the stuff for
  use.
  
  Saffron is no more difficult to work with than any other herb or
  spice, but it is different.  Central to getting good results is not
  to be wasteful and at the same time to respect saffron's potency.
  These two rules contradict each other only if you have measured out
  too much saffron to begin with. To be fully activated, saffron
  threads (hereafter referred to as threads) must come in contact with:
  HEAT, ALCOHOL, CITRUS OR MUST BE POUNDED IN A MORTAR.
  
  I discovered how long good threads release color and flavor by
  pouring two kettles worth of boiling water over 1/2 teaspoon of
  threads (1/4 gram) and leaving them overnight.  By morning I had
  enough yellow- orange liquid to make 40 glasses of tea by adding
  lemon juice, sugar and ice cubes to the concentrate.
  
  Threads can also be steeped in lemon juice, rose or orange water,
  stocks, bouillons, vinegar, or white wine.  I find red wine too heavy
  to use with saffron.  No cookbook authors seem to agree on how long
  saffron should steep (opinions vary from 3 minutes to 48 hours!).
  For practicality and cost effectiveness, I have settled on 20 minutes.
  
  You can achieve great color (pale custard to vibrant yellow-orange)
  in a matter of minutes with good saffron.  It is the flavor which
  takes longer to come out.  I find that as long as I begin my prep
  work with the steeping, I do not prolong my time in the kitchen.  It
  is a matter of getting in the habit.  As long as I steep my threads
  for 20 minutes, it does not seem to matter when I add them to what I
  am cooking.
  
  I was surprised to see Gina Sarra, my hostess in Italy's Abruzzo, add
  the saffron paste, made ahead by adding boiling water to powder, to
  her spaghetti just before she served it.  Again, the key is in
  activating the spice with heat.
  
  POWDERED SAFFRON:
  
  I have not found it necessary to steep powdered saffron.  When I bake
  I find it practical to use powder because it works into chilled butter
  nicely.  The butter's hard surface necessitates the right amount of
  pressure to release saffron's color and flavor.  Room temperature
  butter is too soft to release color although the flavor seems to
  release regardless. If you prefer, saffron can be added to milk or
  water in a baking recipe as well.
  
  Keep in mind 1/2 teaspoon of threads crushes down to a scant 1/8
  teaspoon of powder.  This is why powdered saffron appears so much
  more expensive than threads.  If you are particularly interested in
  powder, you can often find it in Italian delicatessens and gourmet
  shops.
  
  Powdering threads is simple.  In the beginning, use a heavy skillet
  with white insides against which you will be able to monitor the dark
  threads easier than you can in a black skillet.  Over low heat, toast
  the threads just until crispy enough to crumble with your fingers (no
  more than 2 minutes).  It is not a good idea to have your attention
  on any other prep work while you do this.  Dump the crispy threads
  onto kitchen paper and crush them with the back of an ordinary metal
  spoon.

  We're having our annual "Fall Festival" here in Castro Valley, but it
  looks like it doesn't hold a candle to the Austin Hot Sauce Contest.
  
  I really got a kick out of the paper.  Austin looks like a very
  interesting place.  Here's the Habanero salsa recipe.  I would
  approach this with the greatest caution.  ;-}
  
  You don't find too many recipes for Habanero chiles.  This is Pinch a
  Pollo restaurant's recipe for a delicious pico de gallo made with
  fresh Habaneros.
  
  Soak the diced onion in the lime juice for at least 30 minutes.  Add
  all the other ingredients and mix.  Salt to taste.  Serve with
  grilled fish or grilled chicken.  Caution:  Extremely hot!

MMMMM----------------CRISPY FRIED SHALLOT FLAKES---------------------
      6    Shallots, thinly sliced
      1 c  Vegetable oil
 
  It's almost Chinese New Year and the stores are all stocking up on
  fresh fruits which are a traditional Chinese gift for the season.
  Pomelos are a big citrus fruit much like grapefruit, but somewhat
  drier and sweeter. This Thai recipe makes use of them and you should
  be able to find them this time of year.  If not grapefruit will do.
  This is from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 1/30/91, by
  Joyce Jue.
  
  Peel and separate pomelo or grapefruit into segments.  Remove the
  membranes.  Seed.  Gently flake the flesh apart into a bowl.  Chill.
  Hand shred the chicken.  Add chicken and shrimp to pomelo.
  
  In a small bowl mix together the chopped red chile with fish sauce,
  sugar, lime juice and coriander; toss with pomelo chicken mixture.
  
  Arrange the lettuce on a serving platter.  Put the fruit mixture over
  the lettuce.  Top with peanuts and 2 tablespoons of Crisp Fried
  Shallot Flakes, and garnish with red chile slivers.
  
  Serves 4 to 6 as a salad entree.
  
  CRISP FRIED SHALLOT FLAKES: Slice shallots into thin slices. Be sure
  they are all of the same thinness to ensure even cooking. Heat a pan
  with the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add shallots and fry slowly
  until browned and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. The moisture in the
  shallots should be completely cooked out. Drain on paper towel. Store
  in an air-tight container.  Will keep several weeks.

      Title: Yeast Pasty Dough
 Categories: Pies, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 30 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
      1 tb Active dry yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/3 c  Plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
  2 1/2 c  White flour
      1    Egg, beaten
      1 tb Milk (or cream or water)
 
  I love little meat pies of any description.  In the case of samosas,
  they don't even have to have meat in 'em.  Here's a series of seven
  recipes from all over the world for "turnovers".
  
  Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup of the warm water.  Let stand for
  10 minutes until bubbly.  Then stir in remaining warm water 1/3 cup
  olive oil, salt and whole-wheat flour.  Mix well.
  
  Stir in 2 cups white flour and as much of the rest as needed to make
  a soft dough.  Knead well.  Oil the sides of a large bowl with the
  remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Put the dough in the bowl and
  turn to coat with oil.  Let rise until doubled, 1 hour.  Punch dough
  down and let sit for 10 minutes.
  
  Roll dough into 20 x 24-inch rectangle and cut into 4 x 4-inch
  squares. Fill with the salmon-rice or other desired filling.  Fold
  over and seal. Trim excess pastry and decorate top of turnover.  Let
  rise for 10 minutes. Mix egg and milk (or cream or water) to make an
  egg wash and brush it on top of the turnover.  Bake in a 400F oven
  for 20 to 25 minutes until golden.
  
  Makes 30 pasties.

      1    Text Only
 
  LIVER PASTE 2: (Leverpostej 2)
  
  Put 2 lb. pig's liver twice through the grinder.  Then put 1 lb. fat

  slices of pickled gherkin and red beets or red cabbage.
  
  BOILED BREAST OF BEEF:  (Kogt Oksebryst)
  
  Spread the bread with butter and put on slices of boiled breast of
  beef. Decorate with a small pile of chopped pickles at one end and a
  pile of shredded horseradish at the other.  For a center decoration

  THE HANS ANDERSEN SANDWICH:  (H.  C.  Andersen Sandwich)
  
  Butter a piece of either dark or light rye bread and put two rows of
  crisp bacon on top.  Place slice liver paste across one of the rows

  gorgonzola) in a ring, making a hollow in the center. When eating the
  sandwich, break the yolk and spread it across the cheese.
  
  Thin slices of radish may be used to decorate this and other kinds of
  cheese sandwiches.

      Title: Young Artichokes and Fava Beans Stewed in Olive Oil
 Categories: Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     16 sm Artichokes, or
      6 md Artichokes
      2    To 2 1/2 pounds young fava
           -beans, shelled
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      6    Garlic cloves, peeled,
           -minced
      2 tb Chopped fresh winter savory
      2 tb Chopped fresh thyme
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  At no other time of year can this dish be replicated successfully++-
  it epitomizes the tastes of late spring in Provence.  Straight from
  the garden or the open market come either the small, violet
  artichokes or burgeoning green ones, along with pods of favas barely
  swollen with soft, tender beans.  Winter savory, which grows wild on
  the hillsides, has just put forth its new spring flush and is full of
  resinous flavor.  Serve with the freshest, crustiest bread possible
  for sopping up the juices.
  
  Prepare artichokes (see below), then cut small ones in half, larger
  ones into quarters or sixths; pat dry.  Remove the skins from the
  shelled favas.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium high heat.  Add garlic
  and artichoke pieces; saute, stirring frequently, for 4 or 5 minutes.
  Add the fava beans and continue to cook, stirring often, for 10
  minutes. The artichokes will begin to change color to a deep olive
  green, but the favas will stay bright green.
  
  Add the winter savory, thyme, salt and pepper.  Stir well, reduce
  heat to very low, cover, and simmer until the artichokes are tender,
  about 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

  GENERAL PREPARATION OF ARTICHOKES:
  
  Using kitchen shears, cut off the tops (with their sharp spikes) of
  the side and bottom leaves.  Trim the base of the artichoke.
  
  Using a large, sharp chef's knife, cut off the top inch of the
  artichoke.
  
  Unless you are going to stuff the artichoke, cut it in half
  lengthwise. With the edge of a small sharp spoon or with a small,
  sharp knife, scoop out the exposed thistle.  If you are going to
  stuff it, however, do not cut in half; carefully scoop out the center
  leaves along with the thistle.
  
  Put the fresh-trimmed artichokes in acidulated water until ready to
  proceed with recipe.

      Title: Yu Sang (Chinese New Year Salad)
 Categories: Chinese, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Fresh sashimi-grade tuna or
           -striped bass fillet *
      2 c  Peeled, finely shredded
           -Chinese white radish
           -(daikon)
      2 c  Peeled, finely shredded
           -carrot
      6    Thin quarter-sized slices
           -of fresh young ginger,
           -finely shredded
    1/3 c  Finely shredded sweet
           -preserved pickled ginger
           -(see note)
    1/4 c  Finely shredded pickled
           -scallions (see note)
      6    Fresh or frozen kaffir lime
           -leaves, finely shredded
           -(optional)
      1 lg Red jalapeno chile, seeded
           -and finely shredded
    1/2 bn Green onions, finely
           -shredded
    1/2 bn Cilantro, leaves only
    1/4 c  Chopped peanuts
           Toasted sesame seeds, for
           -garnish
      1    Lime or lemon, cut in half
           -and seeded
           Crisp fried shrimp chips
           -or:
           Fried rice stick noodles,
           -for garnish
           MARINADE:
    1/2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 tb Asian sesame oil
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/8 ts Five-spice powder
           Juice of 1 lemon
 
  * (about 6 x 2 x 1/2-inch piece)
  
  The quality and freshness of the fish is crucial for the success of
  the dish.  Purchase the fish from a Japanese fish shop that
  specializes in sashimi, or a reliable fishmonger.  To facilitate the
  very fine shredding of the radish and carrot, use a mandolin or the
  fine shredding disc of a food processor.
  
  Chill fish until firm.  Cut into paper-thin, 2-inch-long slices
  against the grain; set aside.
  
  In separate bowls, cover radishes and carrots with cold water; set
  aside until ready to assemble salad.  Then rinse and squeeze out
  excess water.
  
  To assemble:  Toss fish slices with marinade ingredients.  Place fish
  in center of a platter.  Arrange daikon and carrot shreds around
  fish. Scatter fresh and pickled ginger, the pickled scallions, lime
  leaves, chiles, green onions and cilantro over fish.  Sprinkle with
  peanuts and sesame seeds.
  
  Just before serving, squeeze the lime or lemon juice over all. It is
  customary for everyone to join in and toss the salad.  Using
  chopsticks, each diner digs from the bottom of the salad and lifts
  the ingredients to mix together.
  
  When the salad is fully tossed, taste for seasoning.  Adjust with more
  sesame oil, lime juice, salt and/or some of the juices from the
  pickled vegetables.
  
  Garnish with shrimp chips or fried rice stick noodles.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  NOTE:  Bottled pickled ginger and pickled scallions may be found in
  Chinese markets.  Kaffir lime leaves may be found in Thai grocery
  stores. If kaffir leaves are not available, omit or substitute
  domestic lime leaves.

      Title: Zucchini and Walnut Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Walnut pieces
      2 md Zucchini, unpeeled, ends
           -trimmed
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Brown rice flour
      1 ts Baking powder
        pn Salt
      3 lg Eggs
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Diced candied lemon peel,
           -finely minced
           Powdered sugar
 
  The next three recipes are for cakes made without wheat flour.  This
  first one uses rice flour, but no wheat.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter the sides of an 8 x 2-inch cake pan,
  line the base with a circle of baking parchment and butter the
  parchment. Using a nut mill, grind walnuts to flour and set aside.
  Using the same nut mill, grind zucchini into fine shreds.  There
  should be 1 cup, firmly packed, or 6 ounces.  Place in a sieve and
  press out the liquid.  Combine cornstarch, rice flour, baking powder
  and salt; set aside.
  
  Beat eggs with sugar until lemon-colored and very thick.  A lifted
  beater should leave a slowly dissolving trail of batter.  Using a
  large rubber spatula, lightly fold in grated walnuts and minced lemon
  peel, as though mixing a souffle.  Fluff up zucchini shreds and fold
  in.  Sift cornstarch-flour mixture over batter and quickly fold in,
  retaining as much volume as possible.
  
  Pour into prepared pan (the batter will be loose) and bake for 40
  minutes, until a tester comes out dry.  Let cool in pan for 10
  minutes before unmolding onto a rack.  Peel off paper, reverse onto
  rack right side up, and let cool completely.
  
  Dust with powdered sugar before serving.
  
  Serves 8.
