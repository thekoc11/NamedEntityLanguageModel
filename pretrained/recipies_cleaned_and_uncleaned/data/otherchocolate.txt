      ----HOW TO STORE CHOCOLATE----

Store chocolate tightly wrapped or covered in a cool, dry place or
in the refrigerator.  If refrigerated, let it warm to room
temperature before using.
Occaionally, there may be a slight graying or "bloom" on
chocolate. This does not alter the quality or flavor and when used in
a recipe, the chocolate will regain its color.

ALL ABOUT CHOCOLATE #4   DRND29A

chocolate

      ----HOW TO MELT CHOCOLATE----

Always melt chocolate with gentle heat because it scorches easily.
If chocolate is to be melted alone, make certain that the container
and utensils are absolutely dry; a tiny drop of moisture will cause
the chocolate to become lumpy and stiff.  If this should happen, stir
in one teaspoon of vegetable shortening for each ounce of chocolate.
Remember that unsweetened chocolate liquifies when melted, but
semisweet and baking chocolate will hold their shapes until stirred.
For faster melting, cut or chop chocolate into smaller pieces. To
melt chocolate, place it in a heavy saucepan over low heat and stir
until melted. Or, place chocolate in top of a double boiler and melt
over hot water, stirring until smooth.
To melt chocolate in a microwave oven, place a 1-ounce square in a
1-cup glass measure.  Microwave, uncovered, at MEDIUM (50% power) for
1 to 2 minutes or until chocolate is almost melted. Stir until
completely melted and smooth.  Add 10 seconds for each additional
ounce of chocolate. To melt chocolate morsels in a microwave oven,
place 1 cup chocolate morsels in a 2-cup measure.  Microwave,
uncovered, at MEDIUM (50% power) for 2 to 4 minutes or until morsels
are glossy. Stir until smooth. Formatted by Rose Capoccia drnd29a

ALL ABOUT CHOCOLATE #5   DRND29A

      ----CHOCOLATE GARNISHES----

CHOCOLATE LEAVES:  Select non-poisonous leaves such as mint or rose
leaves. Wash the leaves and pat dry with paper towels. Melt 1 or 2
(1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot water in a double
boiler; let cool slightly.  Using a small spatula, spread a thin
layer of chocolate on the back of each leaf.  Place leaves on a wax
paper-lined cookie sheet, chocolate side up; freeze until chocolate
is firm, about 10 minutes. Grasp leaf at stem end and carefully peel
away from chocolate. Chill leaves until ready to use.

CHOCOLATE CURLS:  Melt 4 (1-ouce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot
water in a double bliler.  Pour chocolate out into a wax paper-lined
cookie sheet. Spread chocolate with a spatula into a 3-inch-wide
strip. Smooth top with a spatula.  Chill chocolate until it feels
slightly tacky but not firm.  (If too hard, curls will break; if too
soft, chocolate will not curl.)  Gently pull a vegetable peeler
across chocolate until curls form. Transfer curls to a tray by
inserting a wooden pick in end of curl. Chill curls until ready to
use. CHOCOLATE-DIPPED FRUIT: Make sure fruit is completely dry before
dipping. Melt 4 (1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot vater
in a double boiler; transfer to a small bowl, and let cool slightly.
Grasp fruit by stem and dip in chocolate, turning to coat the bottom
of the fruit. Allow excess to drip back into bowl. Lay fruit on side
on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet. Allow fruit to stand at room
temperature until chocolate hardens or place in refrigerator about 10
minutes. Don't store coated fruit in refrigerator; the chocolate
coating will sweat when returned to room temperature and will lose
its sheen. CHOCOLATE CUTOUTS: Melt 6 (1-ounce) squares semisweet
chocolate over hot water in a double boiler; cool slightly. Line a
cookie sheet with aluminum foil; pour the chocolate onto the cookie
sheet, and gently shake it until chocolate is smooth and level and
about 1/8-inch thick. Let stand until partially set. Press a cookie
cutter half-way through the chocolate to outline shapes. Remove the
cutter, and let stand until chocolate is firm. When hard, reposition
the cutter over the oulines, and press down to cut smoothly. Lift the
cutter up, and remove the cutout by gently pressing through the
cutter with a small wooden utensil (fingers will leave prints on
chocolate). GRATED CHOCOLATE: You can grate unsweetened, semisweet,
or milk chocolate to sprinkle on top of pies, etc. It's easiest done
in a food processor, but you can grate it by hand. When grating by
hand, hold chocolate with a paper towel or wax paper so heat from
your hand will not soften or melt the chocolate.

Cannoli

chocolate, deserts, cheese

      ----SHELLS----
1 1/2 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup dry red wine or dry marsala
1  oil for frying
      ----FILLING----
1 1/2 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoon candied fruit
1/4 cup chocolate chips
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup chopped pistachios

Sift together sugar, flour and salt.  Work the wine in gradually,
kneading to a soft dough.  Roll out on a floured surface to 1/8-inch
thickness, and cut out five-inch discs. Wrap each disc around a
cannoli form, sealing the edge with egg white.

Heat oil, five inches deep, in a small, deep saucepan, and fry one at
a time until golden and crisp.  Remove with tongs, let oil run off,
and drain on a paper towel. Let the pastry cool slightly, then slip
it carefully off the form.

Note:  Shells will keep for a week or two in a sealed container, so
they can be made ahead.

Filling:  In a mixing bowl, beat the ricotta with an electric mixter.
Add remaining filling ingredients. Stuff shells just before serving.
Sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Caramel Banana Chocolate Chip Ice Cream * Par

chocolate, deserts, bananas

      ----KAREN PHILLIPS CBTX40A----
1 1/4 lb medium bananas; unpeeled
2 cup half-and-half
1 1/2 cup granulated sugar
6  egg yolks
1/8 teaspoon lemon juice
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 cup heavy cream

EQUIPMENT: Measuring cup, measuring spoons, 2 stainless steel bowls (1
large), slotted spoon, film wrap, 2 1/2-qt saucepan, whisk, electric
mixer with paddle, rubber spatula, instant-read test thermometer,
ice-cream freezer, 2-qt plastic container with lid

Peel the bananas. Using a slotted spoon, smash them to a
rough-textured consistency in a stainless steel bowl. Cover with film
wrap and set aside.

Place 1/2 cup of sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan.
Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand).
Caramelize the sugar for 5 to 6 minutes over medium-high heat,
stirring constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar
will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it
caramelizes). Reduce the heat to medium.

Carefully and slowly pour the heavy cream, then the half-and-half
into the caramelized sugar (the mixture will steam and boil rapidly
as the cream is added). Add 1/2 cup of sugar and whisk to dissolve.
Bring to a boil, about 5 minutes.

Caramels Au Chocolat (Chocolate Caramels)

chocolate, candy

3 cup milk
13 oz powdered sugar
1  eggsize piece of glucose
3 1/4 oz chocolate in tablets
1 1/2 oz butter
1/2  vanilla bean

Put milk, sugar, vanilla bean and glucose into a stewpan. Put the
chocolate into a round-bottomed copper pan and melt it slowly on the
stove. Meanwhile, heat the mixture in the stewpan, not letting it
boil, since you merely want to melt the sugar and glucose. When
completely melted, pour this mixture, bit by bit, into the chocolate,
while stirring. When thoroughly mixed, cook at moderate heat,
constantly stirring. Cook to the 'ball' stage. (To test the stage of
cooking by finger, dip the thumb and index finger into cold water,
then into the mixture, bringing the 2 fingers together and dipping
them again into water. This should be done quickly to avoid burning.
The mixture forms a ball that can be rolled with the tip of the
fingers.) Remove from the fire, add the butter, mix well, and pour
onto an oiled marble slab in an oiled, iron framework. Let cool and
cut.

Castillian Hot Chocolate

beverages

1/2 cup cocoa (powdered), unsweetened
1 cup sugar
7 teaspoon cornstarch (cornflour)
1/2 cup water
4 cup milk

Mix the cocoa and sugar together.

Dissolve the cornstarch (cornflour) in the water and combine with the
cocoa-sugar mixture in a medium-sized saucepan.  Stir this until it is a
smooth paste.  Begin heating this mixture, continuously stirring it with a
whisk.  Gradually pour in the milk.  Continue stirring as you bring it to a
simmer.  Simmer, stirring often, for about 10 minutes. The cocoa is ready
when it thickens and is glossy and smooth.

NOTES:

*  Thick, rich Spanish hot chocolate -- I first tasted this wonderful
beverage while touring in northern Spain with a choir. It's not like any
hot chocolate I've had anywhere else, and I was delighted to find a recipe
in "The Vegetarian Epicure Book Two." It is the best hot chocolate in the
world (at least to me.)

*  The consistency of the finished product should resemble chocolate
pudding that didn't quite set. If you halve this recipe, you'll get just
the right amount for two large mug-fulls. This cocoa is especially
fantastic when you dip churros into it (a churro is a sugary, deep-fried,
doughnut-like stick, and if anyone wants to send out a recipe, I'd be most
grateful).

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes.

Chilled Orange Cappuccino Cream W/ Grated Cho

beverages, chocolate

      ----KAREN PHILLIPS CBTX40A----
4 cup heavy cream
4 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/2 cup half-and-half
4 tablespoon instant espresso powder
6  egg yolks
2 tablespoon grand marnier
2  eggs
1/2 oz chunk semi-sweet chocolate; finely grated
1/2 cup granulated sugar

EQUIPMENT:  Measuring cup, measuring spoons, hand grated, 2 1/2-qt
saucepan, electric mixer with paddle, and balloon whip, rubber
spatula, whisk, instant-read test thermometer, 2 stainless steel
bowls (1 large), pastry bag, 8  8-oz coffee cups

Heat 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream and the half-and-half in a 2 1/2-qt
saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. While the cream is
heating, combine the egg yolks, eggs, sugar, cornstarch, and instant
espresso powder in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
paddle. Beat the mixture on high for 2 minutes, scrape down the sides
of the bowl, and continue mixing on high until the mixture is
slightly thickened, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. (At this point the
cream should be boiling. If not, adjust the mixer speed to low and
continue to mix until the cream boils. If his is not done, the eggs
will develop undesirable lumps.) Pour the boiling cream into the
beaten egg mixture and whisk to combine. Return to the saucepan and
heat over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until the cream
reaches a temperature of 180 degrees, about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove
from the heat and transfer to a stainless steel bowl. Cool the
espresso-custard mixture in an ice-water bath to a temperature for 40
to 45 degrees, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Chocolate Almond Crisps * Part 1 Of 2

chocolate, deserts

      ----KAREN PHILLIPS CBTX40A----
      ----ALMOND MERINGUE CRISPS----
3/4 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup plus 2 t granulated sugar
2  egg whites
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
      ----CHOCOLATE GANACHE----
6 oz semi-sweet chocolate; broken into 1/2-oz pcs.
7 tablespoon heavy cream
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
1 teaspoon unsalted butter

EQUIPMENT:  Measuring cup, measuring spoons, 2 baking sheets, food
processor with metal blade, electric mixer with balloon whip, rubber
spatula, parchment paper, pastry bag, double boiler, film wrap,
whisk, 1 1/2-qt saucepan, small stainless steel bowl, medium star tip

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Lightly toast the almonds on a baking
sheet in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and
cool to room temperature. Reduce the oven temperature to 225 degrees.
In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, coarsely
process the toasted almonds with 2 tablespoons of sugar into pieces
1/8 inch in size. Set aside until needed. Line two baking sheets with
parchment paper. Create a meringue by whisking the egg whites on
medium speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a balloon
whip. Whisk until frothy, about 1 minute. Add the cream of tartar and
salt, increase speed to high, and whisk until the egg whites begin to
stiffen, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. While continuing to whisk on high speed,
gradually add 1/2 cup granulated sugar. The egg whites should form
peaks that are stiff, but not dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add almond
extract and whisk on high for an additional 30 seconds. Remove the
bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to fold in the chopped
almonds and cornstarch.

2 1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted

chocolate in heavy saucepan; place over low heat, stirring
constantly, until combined. Remove from heat and cool. Stir in eggs
and amaretto. Combine flour and salt; add to creamed mixture,
stirring well. Pour batter into a lightly greased 13 x 9 x 2" king
pan. Bake at 400 for 20 minutes; cool. Frost with Amaretto frosting,
sprinkle with sliced almonds (or arrange in flowery patterns). Cut
into squares. Note: 3 Tbs powdered baking cocoa can be substituted
for chocolate squares. Combine butter & chocolate in a heavy
saucepan; place over low heat and stir constantly until melted. Stir
in half and half. Add powdered sugar, salt, Amaretto, stirring until
smooth. Yield: Enough frosting for 2 dozen brownies. (Original recipe

2  oranges
2 cup water; divided
1/2 cup granulated sugar

2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1/4 cup granulated sugar
4 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 cup water
      Triple sec ----for garnish-----
1  orange segments

Recipe by: webmaster@godiva.com * whipped to soft mound stage

Make the Brazil nut-orange cups:

1. Position a rack in the center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees F.
Spread the Brazil nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for 10
minutes. Transfer the nuts to a large kitchen towel and rub briskly to
remove most of the skins. Open the towel and spread out the nuts to cool,
discarding the paper skins.

2. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade,
combine the peeled nuts and the sugar. Process for 30 to 45 seconds until
finely ground. Add the flour and process for 30 seconds to combine. Add the
melted butter and orange rind, and process for 20 to 30 seconds. Add the
egg whites and process for 20 to 30 seconds, until blended.

3. Because you must work quickly to prevent the cups from cooling and
getting hard before you have molded them, bake only two cups at a time.
Have 2 or more 6-ounce custard cups ready to use as molds.
Spoon two tablespoons of batter for each cup on each half of the baking
sheet. Using the back of the spoon. spread the batter for each cup into a
thin 6-inch circle. Be careful not to leave any bare spots or there will be
holes in the cups.

4. Bake the cookies for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the cookies are evenly
golden and the edges are slightly browned. Remove the sheet from the oven.
Using a metal spatulas loosen the edges of one of the cookies and lift it
off the baking sheet. Quickly press the cookie into one of the custard cups
to form the cup shape.
Immediately repeat the shaping process with the second cookie.
Cool the cookies completely, and then gently lift them out of the molds.

5. Repeat the above process with the remaining batter, making two cups at
a time. Store the cups in an airtight container at room temperature as soon
as they are completely cool.

Make the chocolate orange pudding:

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of the half-and-half,
cornstarch, and cocoa powder until smooth. Whisk in the eggs and the yolks
until blended.

2. In a heavy, medium, noncorrosive saucepan, combine the remaining
half-and-half, sugar, salt and orange zest. Cook over medium heat, stirring
occasionally, until small bubbles form around the side of the pan.
Gradually whisk one cup of the hot half-and-half mixture into the
cornstarch/egg mixture until blended. Pour this mixture back into the
saucepan. Continue cooking over medium heat, whisking constantly until the
mixture starts to form bubbles.
Continue stirring and allow the mixture to boil for 2 minutes.

3. Remove the pan from the heat and gently stir in the chopped chocolate
until smooth. Strain the pudding through a sieve into a bowl. Stir in the
vanilla. Cover the surface of the pudding with plastic wrap. Refrigerate
until well chilled. about 3 hours.

Make the candied orange zests:

1. With a vegetable peeler remove only the outer orange part of the rind.
Reserve the oranges for the segments . Stack 2 or 3

heat. Let stand a few mins. Skim off and discard white foam from top
and do not use any milky residue that sinks to bottom. The clear
yellow liquid is clarified butter. 2. Preheat oven to 350 F. In a
medium bowl, combine pecans, cinnamon, 1/4 cup sugar, and chocolate
chips; mix well. Open and stack filo sheets on a damp towel. Cover
with a damp towel to prevent drying out. Brush a 12 x 18-in sheet
cake pan with clarified butter. Layer half of filo sheets (about 10 x
12) in pan, brushing each sheet with butter. Spread half of nut
mixture evenly over layered filo sheets. Brush next filo sheet on
both sides with butter; then place on top of nuts. Add 5 or 6 more
filo sheets, brushing each sheet with butter. Top with remaining nut
mixture. Butter next filo sheet on both sides and place on top of
nuts. Top with remaining filo sheets, brushing each with butter. 3.
Using a sharp knife, cut pastry into 50 diamond-shaped pieces. Do not
remove pastry from pan. Brush top with remaining clarified butter.
Bake 40 to 50 mins, or until golden. 4. About 30 mins before baklava
is finished baking, in a small saucepan, combine remaining 1/2 cup
sugar and orange juice. Heat to boiling over medium heat, stirring
often. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 mins. Stir in vanilla.
Pour hot orange syrup over hot pastry as soon as it is removed from
oven. Let stand until cool, 4 hours or over night. 5. When baklava is
cool, drizzle Thin Chocolate Glaze on top. Allow glaze to set up
before serving. Baklava may be kept, covered, 4 to 5 days at room
temperature. Freeze for longer storage.

Chocolate Balls With Cherry Centers

candy

50  whole candied cherries
3/4 cup cherry brandy (more may be necessar; y)
1/2 lb sweet milk chocolate, broken into p; ieces
1/4 lb unsweetened baking chocolate, broke; n into pieces
1 1/3 cup powdered sugar
7/8 cup butter, softened
3 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa
1  powdered sugar
1  unsweetened cocoa

Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer. Drain the
cherries, reserve the brandy.

Cream the butter and sugar in a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
chocolates.  Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the
butter and sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.

Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir by hand
until all is absorbed.  Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.

Put mixture in the freezer and thoroughly chill. Prepare a surface to
assemble the balls.  Mix equal amounts of cocoa and powdered sugar,
about 1/3 cup each. On a piece of waxed paper, heavily dust with the
cocoa powdered sugar mixture.  Remove the chocolate from the freezer
when it is chilled and stiff. For each cherry, spoon out a heaping
teaspoon of the chocolate and drop on dusted paper. Dip your fingers
into the cocoa/sugar mixture and flatten chocolate to a small
pancake. Place a cherry in the center and fold chocolate around it.
Gently roll the ball between your palms to form and finish by rolling
the ball in the cocoa/sugar mixture. Repeat for each cherry. If the
chocolate mixture softens, return to the freezer to firm up.

Place the completed balls in a container with a lid and store in the
frig.

These balls are dense and heavy with a rich chocolate flavor. For a
lighter flavor, I suggest you omit the unsweetened baking chocolate
and add 1/4 lb. more milk chocolate.

Licking your fingers is not permitted during the assembly, but
manditory after you are done.  (grin)

Chocolate Balls With Cherry Cordial Centers

candy

50  whole candied cherries
3/4 cup cherry brandy (more may be necessar; y)
1/2 lb sweet milk chocolate, broken into p; ieces
1/4 lb unsweetened baking chocolate, broke; n into pieces
1 1/3 cup powdered sugar
7/8 cup butter, softened
3 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa

Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer. Drain the
cherries, reserve the brandy.

Cream the butter and sugar in a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
chocolates.  Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the
butter and sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.

Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir by hand
until all is absorbed. Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.

Put mixture in the freezer and thoroughly chill. Prepare a surface to
assemble the balls.  Mix equal amounts of cocoa and powdered sugar,
about 1/3 cup each. On a piece of waxed paper, heavily dust with the
cocoa powdered sugar mixture. Remove the chocolate from the freezer
when it is chilled and stiff. For each cherry, spoon out a heaping
teaspoon of the chocolate and drop on dusted paper. Dip your fingers
into the cocoa/sugar mixture and flatten chocolate to a small
pancake. Place a cherry in the center and fold chocolate around it.
Gently roll the ball between your palms to form and finish by rolling
the ball in the cocoa/sugar mixture. Repeat for each cherry. If the
chocolate mixture softens, return to the freezer to firm up.

Place the completed balls in a container with a lid and store in the
frig.

These balls are dense and heavy with a rich chocolate flavor. For a
lighter flavor, I suggest you omit the unsweetened baking chocolate
and add 1/4 lb. more milk chocolate.

Licking your fingers is not permitted during the assembly, but
manditory after you are done.  (grin)

There's yet another variation to chocolate covered cherries. It's for
the brave & daring at heart.

You have to start in the summertime, when cherries are ripe. You take
a pound of them, a pound of rock candy, and a fifth of good brandy or
bourbon. Mix together, & let set in the back of the 'fridge for 3-4
months.

When you finally get around to making the chocolate covered cherries,
you use the preserved cherries for the centers, & the liquor as the
base for the cordial. Courtesy of: Al Martin

Chocolate Bananas

deserts, bananas, camping food

6  small sweet ripe bananas
1 teaspoon lemon juice
4 oz chocolate rice or sweet chocolate c; hips or chocolate slices

Peel bananas and squirt a little lemon juice on them to prevent
turning brown. Slice the peeled bananas length-wise into half and
stuff the chocolate filling into them, like you would do to a hot
dog. Sprinkle some nuts if you like. Wrap the bananas individually in
aluminium foil paper until they are all tightly wrapped up. Bring to
campfire, throw INTO the embers (the red hot burnt charcoals) for 5
minutes. Open up the foil, the chocolate would have melted, the banas
soft & "baked" and the nuts add a crunchy texture. Enjoy!!

Chocolate Baumkuchen

chocolate, deserts, nuts

1 x no ingredients

10 large eggs, yolk and whites separated
3/4 C. regular unsalted stick butter or margarine (not spread, at
room temperature)
1 C. granulated sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 C. all-purpose flour
1/3 C. cornstarch
2 Tbl. unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp. instant coffee powder (not granular)
Large pinch salt
FILLING:
1# (2 2/3 C.) semisweet-chocolate chips
1/2 C. regular unsalted stick butter or margarine (not spread)
2 Tbl. water
1/2 tsp instant coffee powder (not granular)
BARK:
3-4 ounces semisweet chocolate
For garnish - Confectioners' sugar, whipped cream

1.  Generously oil or grease a 15 1/2 X 10 1/4" jelly roll pan.
2.  Beat egg yolks in large bowl with electric mixer about 8 minutes until
thick and pale.  Beat in butter and 3/4 C. of the sugar for 3- 4 minutes
until
pale and fluffy.  Beat in vanilla until blended.
3.  Mix flour, cornstarch, cocoa, coffee and salt.  Stir into egg mixture.
4.  With clean beaters, beat egg whites in a large bowl until soft peaks
form
when beaters are lifted.  Sprinkle on remaining 1/4 C. sugar and continue
beating until mixture forms firm peaks.  Stir a large spoon of the whites
into
the yolk mixture, then gently stir or fold in the remaining whites.
5.  Measure batter, then divide in fourths.  Spread 1/4 of the batter in
prepared pan.  Spread it as evenly as possible, covering the entire
surface of
pan.  Broil 5-6 inches from heat source for 1- 2 minutes, turning the pan
as
necessary to make sure the entire surface is firm and lightly browned.  A
few
light-brown speckles may appear, but don't let cake get crisp.
6.  Remove from heat.  Run a knife around edges.  After sitting for about a
minutes, cake should lift from pan.  Turn pan over and gently let cake
drop on
a sheet of waxed paper. (Pull gently at corner if cake seems to need
additional help.) Grease pan again and make 3 more layers.
7.  FILLING:  Put chocolate chips, butter and the 2 Tbl. of water in a pan
over hot water.  Stir until melted and smooth (it should be easily
spreadable,
so add a bit more water as needed).  Stir in coffee.
8.  TO ASSEMBLE:  Spread a very thin layer of filling (a scant 1/3 C.) over
first cake layer.  Roll up tightly, starting from one short edge.  Spread
another layer with filling.  Line up the rolled layer on top and roll up as
tightly as possible.  Repeat with remaining 2 layers.  The resulting log
should be a good 5" in diameter.  Place on serving platter.  Spread
remaining
filling over whol cake except one end.
9. BARK:  Melt chocolate over hot water, stirring until smooth. Pour out
on a
smooth kitchen counter or marble slab.  Run a long flexible spatula back
and
forth over chocolate, smoothing it thin and working it just until it loses
its
gloss.  Allow chococlate to harden (it could take 10 minutes or so,
depending
on your kitchen temperature).  With edge of spatula or large chef's knife,
angle into the chocolate and scrape along, turning up large rolls of
chocolate
in rough barklike sections.
10.  Arrange over top of cake.  Let frosting harden.  (Cake can be
refrigerated at this point.  Let stand a room temperature 1 hour before
slicing.)
11.  Just before serving, sprinkle cake lightly with confectioners' sugar.
Serve with whipped cream.

Chocolate Berries Or Orange Sections

candy

      ----SUSAN AARONSON PSTT79C----
1  perfect strawberries
1  <<<or better still>>>
1  long stemmed berries
1  that are sold in many
1  fruit markets
6 oz good quality bittersweet
1  chocolate
1  orange sections
1  white chocolate; opt'l

Here's the recipe for the chocolate berries or orange sections. Pick
out perfect strawberries with fresh looking green tops, or better
still, get the long stemmed berries that are sold in many fruit
markets. Wash and THOROUGHLY DRY the berries on paper toweling. If
any of the berries have soft spots, don't dip them. The juice will
leak out and the finished product will look awful. Melt about 6
ounces of very good quality bittersweet chocolate. I use Belgian or
French chocolate, but Lindt or Tobler are also excellent. Line cookie
sheets with waxed paper. When chocolate is melted and smooth pour it
into a dish that will give you depth rather than surface.  Pick up a
berry by the leaves and dip it into the chocolate about 3/4 of the
way, leaving the stems and a bit of the berry showing. Let excess
chocolate drip back into the bowl and place the dipped berry onto the
lined cookie sheet. Put in refrigerator to harden chocolate. If you
want to get fancier, melt some white chocolate and dip the very
bottom of the dark chocolate dipped berry into the white chocolate or
put the melted white chocolate into a pastry bag, fitted with a very
fine writing tip, and sort of 'write' squiggly lines all over the dark
chocolate.  I like to serve these berries on non-toxic green leaves
or palm fronds that can be purchased from a florist. Orange sections
dipped in chocolate are a bit trickier but fantastic. Completely peel
an orange, being very careful not to pierce the membrane that
surrounds each section. Remove as much of the pith that clings to the
orange section. Blot the sections on paper towels to absorb ANY
moisture. Melt the chocolate as described above and put it into a
dish that is large enough to accommodate a whole section of orange.

Chocolate Biscotti

frozen

1 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar; or more
1/2 cup cocoa
2 teaspoon flavoring  (raspberr y,orange, or a; lmond)
2  egg equivalent
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  splash liquor; ie, chambord
1  semisweet chocolate; melted;optional

Recipe by: FF Mailing List  (Christel Reeve) Combine flour, sugar, cocoa,
salt and baking baking powder.  Separately, mix flavoring and eggs.
Combine.  Add splash of liquor or water as needed to have a sticky
consistency.  If the mixture is too stiff, it won't spread out properly.

Put this glob on a greased cookie sheet and arrange it into a log about 15
inches long and 1 1/2 - 2" wide. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes. Remove from
oven, let cool a few minutes, then slice diagonally into 1/2- 3/4" slices.
I got 18 pieces from mine. Place the slices on their side and put back in
the oven (300 degrees) for 15 minutes.  Turn over and cook another 10-15
minutes.

If you can afford the fat, a small drizzle of semisweet chocolate is
wonderful on these when cooled. I used about 2 T. for all the cookies,
which added about 6 g. fat to the recipe or 1/3 g. fat each one.

Hi there!  I use this recipe in my bread machine but you could bake
it in two loaf pans just as easily. It's heavenly when it's warm and
spread with cream cheese! All I have to do is dump the ingredients
into the bread machine and press a button.  You'd have to knead, etc.
without one. Possible, but I have no pioneer spirit.

Chocolate Bread Pudding  Lowfat

chocolate, puddings, low fat

12 slice french bread slice --
1  good-quality, day-
1  old, or italian
1  baguette, about 1
1  thick (3-4 oz total
1  wt)  (1)
1 1/2  egg beaters® 99% egg
1  substitute -- equiv to 3
1  eggs (2)
2 1/2 cup milk, 1% lowfat -- (2.  5)
1/4 cup honey -- (3)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon brandy -- or kahlua
1/3 cup cocoa powder --
1  dutch-process (4)
2 teaspoon cornstarch
1 pinch salt

Last night I finally tried the chocolate bread recipe in "Sweet
Nothings" and it was GREAT! The only fat comes from that which is in
1/3 C. of cocoa powder and the bread. It's supposed to have 3 eggs,
but I didn't have any eggs so I used substitute instead and it was
fine.

Even though I was out of a lot of the ingredients, I managed to
make-do with what I had on hand. Perhaps it would've been tastier if
made exactly according to recipe, but as it stands it's pretty damn
tasty!

Here's the original unaltered recipe (my alterations are below):

Arrange bread slices, staggering them, in a 12 - 14" long oval gratin
dish or a 4 C souffle dish.

In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, honey, sugar, vanilla
and brandy or Kahlua. Sift the cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt
together onto the egg mixture, then whisk until thoroughly combined
(and your arm will probably want to fall off at this point).

Pour the cocoa-egg mixture evenly over the bread slices and let stand
until all the bread is thoroughly saturated with the custard.
Depending upon the freshness of the bread (5) and the dish you
choose, this could take 1 - 2 hrs. Bake the pudding in a 325 deg F
oven for 40 - 60 min, until it is barely firm to the touch but not
dry and pulling away from the sides of the dish. Serve warm or,
alternatively, cover and chill thoroughly before serving. 170
calories, 2.
7 g  fat (6)

1) I didn't have the right bread but I did have some Squaw bread in
the freezer so I dried it out in the over at a low temperature for
about 1/2 an hour.

2) I didn't have eggs so I used egg sub.

2.  5) Forgot this one. I didn't have any skim milk on hand so I used
a can of nonfat evaporated milk and added water to make 2. 5 C.

3) I didn't have any honey so I used corn syrup (a little extra
because honey is so sweet).

4) You can use unsweetend Herschey's cocoa for it if you don't want
to try to locate dutch-process. Actually, dutch-processing just
leaves more of the fat in the cocoa.

5) I broke the bread up into pieces rather than leaving it in slices.
I figured that would help along the soaking process. I let it soak
for 10-15 min.

6) Probably lots less fat without using real eggs. I estimate 3g from
the cocoa. At most only 1g or so per serving. -- npm@netcom. com

is done. Serve the pudding warm, topped with dollops of whipped

Chocolate Butter~ Nutted Or Not

deserts, sauces, spreads

3/4 cup packed, high quality dutch-
1  process cocoa
1 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup hot water
3/4 cup high-quality unsalted butter
1  at room temperature
1/2 each to 1 tsp. vanilla extract or
1  to taste
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup toasted and coarsely chopped
1  walnuts or toasted, skinned
1  and coarsely chopped hazel-
1  nuts (optional)

Combine the cocoa, sugar and salt in the top pan of a double boiler
(or use a heatproof bowl that can be placed over a saucepan,
containing simmering water). Stir the mixture with a whisk until it
is thoroughly mixed, then mix in the hot water thoroughly.  Set the
pan over simmering water and stir the contents until the sugar has
completely dissolved and the mixture is hot, about 3 minutes.  Remove
the top from the base and set it aside; cool the contents to lukewarm.

Cream the butter together with the vanilla and the almond extracts in
the small bowl of an electric mixer, or use a food processor to beat
the butter with the flavorings just until it is light. With the motor
of the machine running, gradually add the lukewarm chocolate mixture,
continuing to beat just until everything is well combined. Let the
chocolate butter cool completely, stirring or whisking it
occasionally to lighten its texture. Add the nuts, if you're making
the nutted version; then scrape the chocolate butter into a clean,
dry storage jar, cover it tightly and refrigerate it.  Makes about 2
1/2 cups with nuts or 1
3/4    cups without nuts.

Note:  This wonderful recipe was copied from The Old Farmer's Almanac
Good Cook's Companion magazine referring to the recipes creator,
Helen Witty's recipe from her book "A Little of What You Fancy
(Workman, 1997). She describes chocolate butter as "a luxurious
spread/sauce/confection that keeps up to six weeks in the
refrigerator unless you devour it first; warmed as a sauce, spread as
a cake or cookie filling, or rolled into instant truffles".  How
could anyone pass up this recipe? Converted to Meal-Master by Kountry

Chocolate Caramel Truffles

chocolate, candy, godiva

1  caramel:
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons gran --
1  ulated sugar
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup heavy cream
1  ganache:
8 oz bittersweet chocolate --
1  coarsely chopped
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon unsalted butter -- softened
2 tablespoon vanilla extract
1  confectioners' sugar
1  unsweetened cocoa powder

Make the caramel: In a small heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and
water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar
dissolves. Then continue to boil, without stirring, 4 to 5 minutes
longer, or until the syrup caramelizes and turns a deep amber in
color. Immediately remove the syrup from the heat and add the cream.
(The mixture will bubble up). Using a wooden spoon, stir until
completely smooth; if necessary, briefly return the caramel to low
heat and stir until smooth. Scrape into a small bowl and let cool to
room temperature. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.
Make the ganache: Place the chocolate in a food processor fitted with
the metal blade and process until finely chopped. In a small
saucepan, over medium heat, bring the cream to a gentle boil. With
the motor of the food processor running, pour the cream through the
feed tube. Process for 10 to 15 seconds, until the chocolate is
completely melted. Using a spatula, scrape down the side of the work
bowl.

Add the butter and vanilla and process for about 5 seconds, or until
the mixture is smooth and creamy. Scrape the ganache into a medium
bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to
pipe, about 1 hour. Make the caramel centers: Line a small baking
sheet with waxed paper. Using a 1/4-teaspoon measuring spoon dipped
in cold water, scoop out level spoonfuls of the caramel and place
about 1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Freeze until firm, at least
30 minutes. Form the truffles: Transfer the chilled ganache to a
pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip (such as Ateco #6). Pipe
1 1/4-inch mounds with pointed peaks onto a clean baking sheet.
Refrigerate or freeze the truffles for 10 to 20 minutes, or until
just firm enough to roll. Sift a light dusting of confectioners'
sugar over the chilled truffles. Lightly coat the palms and
fingertips of your hands with confectioners' sugar. With your
fingertips, pinch a truffle into a round, then roll it gently between
your palms into a slightly irregularly shaped 1 1/4 inch ball. Place
the rolled truffle on the baking sheet, and form the remaining
truffles into rounds. Refrigerate the truffles for about 10 minutes,
just until firm. Remove the rolled truffles from the refrigerator.
Remove 5 or 6 of the caramel centers from the freezer and place on a
cold plate. Working quickly, with your fingertips, pinch a caramel
center into a small ball. With the tip of your index finger, make an
indentation about 2/3 of the way through the center of a chocolate
truffle. Insert the caramel center in the truffle and, with your
fingertips, mold the chocolate over the caramel,

covering it completely. Place on a baking sheet and repeat the
procedure with the remaining chocolate truffles and caramel centers.
Refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes. Roll half the chocolate
truffles in sifted confectioners' sugar to coat. Roll the remaining
truffles in sifted cocoa powder to coat. Store the truffles for up to
5 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Remove from the
refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. ~ Judith Sutton

Chocolate Chip Orange Scones

chocolate, scones

2  all-purpose flour
1/3  granulated sugar
2  baking powder
1/2  salt
1/2  unsalted butter; chilled
2  eggs
1/4  orange juice
1  vanilla extract
1/2  orange peel; grated
3/4  miniature chocolate chips
1  egg white; mixed with
1/2  water; for glaze, optional

Recipe by: American Country Inn and Bed & Breakfast
Preheat oven to 400 degrees; butter a 9-inch
circle in the center of a baking sheet.  In a large
bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder
and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and
distribute them over the flour mixture. With a pastry
blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in
the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
In a small bowl, stir together the eggs, orange juice,
vanilla extract and orange peel.  Add to the flour
mixture and stir to combine. The dough will be sticky.
With lightly floured hands, knead in the chocolate
chips until they are evenly distributed.  With lightly
floured hands, pat the dough into an 8-inch circle in
the center of the baking sheet. If desired, brush the
egg white mixture over the tops and sides of the
dough. With a serrated knife, cut the dough into 8
wedges. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a
toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool for 10
minutes. With a spatula, transfer the scones to a wire
rack to cool. Recut into wedges if necessary. Serve
warm or cool completely and store in an air-tight
container.
These scones freeze well.   Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).

Chocolate Chunk Brownies

chocolate, brownies, godiva

1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon double acting baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
14 oz semisweet chocolate --
1  finely chopped
1 cup granulated sugar
9 tablespoon unsalted butter -- cut
1  tablespoons
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup water
3 large eggs -- chilled
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnut --
1  halves, divided
9 oz swiss dark chocolate -- cut
1  inch chunks -- divided

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees
F. Line a 13-by-9 1/2-inch baking pan with a double thickness of
aluminum foil so that the foil extends 2 inches beyond the two short
ends of the pan. Fold the overhang down along the sides of the pan.
Butter the bottom of the foil-lined pan. In a medium bowl, stir
together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Place the
semisweet chocolate in a large bowl. In a medium saucepan, combine
the sugar, butter, corn syrup and water. Cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the butter melts, the
sugar is dissolved and the mixture comes to a boil. Remove the pan
from the heat and pour the hot syrup over the chocolate. Let the
mixture stand for 1 to 2 minutes, to melt the chocolate. Whisk until
smooth. One at a time, whisk in the eggs, blending until smooth.
Whisk in the vanilla and the flour mixture, mixing until the batter
is smooth. Using a rubber spatula, fold in 1 cup of the walnuts and 6
ounces of the Swiss chocolate chunks. Scrape the batter into the
prepared pan and spread it evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle the
remaining 1/2 cup of walnuts and 3 ounces of chocolate chunks over
the top of the batter. Bake the brownies for 40 to 50 minutes, or
until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center of the
brownie comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Cool the
brownies in the pan set on a wire rack. When the brownies are
completely cool, cover the pan of brownies with plastic wrap and let
the brownies set at room temperature for at least 6 hours or
overnight. Invert the brownies onto a large plate or cutting board.
Remove the pan and carefully peel off the foil. Invert again onto a
smooth cutting surface and cut into 24 bars. Store the brownies at
room temperature in an airtight container for up to five days.

Chocolate Cordials

candy

1  maraschino cherries or pineapple in; heavy syrup
1  summer coating
1  divert sugar

Melt summer coating over hot (NOT boiling) water. Using a small
paint brush coat the insides of the molds, holding up to light to
check for thin spots. Chill until set.
Mix cherry juice or a small amount of pineapple syrup with divert
sugar to make a thick paste, about the consistency of the melted
chocolate. Put fondant mix into chocolate shells, add a cherry or
piece of pineapple. Cover with summer coating, tap sides of mold to
release air bubbles, and freeze for 2 to 3 minutes. When set unmold

Chocolate Covered Ants

deserts, snacks

1742 large ants, (if they are sm., use 2,044)
3 cup melted chocolate

Catch ants at a picnic site and keep them in a glass jar to which you
have added a teaspoon of sugar to keep them happy. (Unhappy ants are
liable to go sour before processing.) At home, pick up each ant with
tweezers and remove entrails with a small, very sharp knife edge.
This will take about 400 hours.  If you are in a hurry, eliminate
this step; you'll never know the difference. Dip each ant into melted
chocolate and place to drain on waxed paper.  If any of them are
still able to crawl off the paper, let them go -- be a good sport!!

Chocolate Covered Candied Cherries

candy

50  whole candied cherries
3/4 cup cherry brandy
1/2 lb sweet milk chocolate, broken into p; ieces
1/4 lb unsweetened baking chocolate, broke; n into pieces
1 1/3 cup powdered sugar
3 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa
1  powdered sugar
1  unsweetened cocoa

Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer. Drain cherries,
reserve the brandy.

Cream butter and sugar with a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
chocolates. Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the
butter and sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.

Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir in my hand
until all is absorbed.  Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.

Put mixture in a clean bowl and thoroughly chill in the freezer.
Meanwhile, make a 50-50 mixture of powdered sugar and cocoa. Begin
with 1/3 c. EACH and mix thoroughly. Heavily dust a sheet of waxed
paper on a working surface.

When the chocolate mixture is chilled and very stiff, remove from the
freezer. Drop by teaspoonfuls on dusted working surface and dust your
fingers in the sugar/cocoa mixture, press with fingers to make a
small flat shape with the chocolate.  Drop a cherry in the center and
form a ball around the cherry.

Working quickly, complete the shape by rolling the ball between your
palms.

Roll ball in sugar/cocoa mixture to coat.  Continue working until the
chocolate mixture is too soft to continue. Return to freezer to chill
some more and continue until all the chocolate and cherries are gone.

The chocolate covered cherries can be stored in the frig.

For a lighter, sweeter chocolate taste, increase the sweet chocolate
and decrease or eliminate the unsweetened chocolate. The more milk
chocolate you use, the more diffucult it will be to work with as it
melts rather rapidly.

You can also substitute and equal portion of semi-sweet bits (toll
house chocolates) for the chocolate.

Other candied fruit and liquors can be used according to your taste.

Enjoy!

Chocolate Crackles #1

deserts, australian

8 oz copha
8 oz icing sugar
3 1/2 teaspoon cocoa
5 cup rice bubbles
1/2 cup sultanas (optional)

Combine sifted icing sugar, cocoa, rice bubbles and optional
sultanas. Melt copha and add to ingredients and mix thoroughly. Spoon
into paper cups and allow to set.

NOTES:

*  A traditional Australian sweet snack -- Mention this recipe to an
Australian abroad and he will instantly get homesick. Yield: serves 6.

*  Rice Bubbles are called Rice Krispies in North America. Icing
sugar is confectioner's sugar. Sultanas are like raisins. Copha, it
would appear, is utterly unavailable outside Australia. It is a
partially-solidified shortening made of coconut oil.

: Difficulty:  easy if you can get the ingredients.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Chocolate Damnation Help

peanut butter, cream/desse, frozen, austrian

1 x no ingredients

Hic flegetoteas patiatur sulphure flammas: "May he endure
the fire and brimstone of hell." Contrary to this ancient
curse, eating our chocolate damnation will bring about only
heavenly pleasure. On the other hand, preparing it may drive

you in the other direction.
Although the preparation and assembly of this cake can be
completed in one day (an early wake up call is recommended),
it may be more practical to spread out the preparation over
a two or three day period.

Two-Day program: Day 1: Prepare and refrigerate the
chocolate cheesecake, chocolate cake, and raspberry glaze
(all covered with film wrap) until assembly. Keep the
reserved cup of chocolate cookie crumbs at room temperature
until assembly. Day 2: Early in the day, complete assembly
except for the last ganache and cookie crumb coating, which
can be done two to three hours before serving the cake. Cut
and serve the cake as directed.

Three-Day Program: Day 1: Prepare and refrigerate the
chocolate cheesecake, chocolate cake and raspberry glaze
(all covered with film wrap). Keep the reserved cup of
chocolate cookie crumbs at room temperature until final
assembly. Day 2: Complete assembly except for the ganache
coating and cookie crumb coating. Keep the partially
assembled cake refrigerated. Day 3: Early in the day,
complete the final assembly. Keep the chocolate damnation
refrigerated until cutting and serving.

In making the cheesecake, it is important that the mixing
bowl be frequently scraped down as directed and that the
mixture be thoroughly combined. Failure to do so will result
in a lumpy batter and visible white lumps or streaks of
cream cheese in the baked cheese cake.
Use several toothpicks inserted in the sides of the
chocolate cake as guides to accurately halve the cake
horizontally.
The preparations may also be completed using a hand held
electric mixer (mixing time may increase slightly), or by
hand with a wire whisk (mixing time may double).
Use half the following recipe to make the raspberry glaze if
fresh red raspberries are not available.

1 10oz package frozen red raspberries in syrup
1/4 cup granulated sugar
5 Tablespoons water
1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Puree the frozen raspberries in a food processor fitted with
a steel blade. Transfer the puree to a 2.1/2 qt saucepan and
combine with sugar, water and lemon juice. Bring to a boil
over medium high heat and allow to boil for 5 minutes.
Remove and cool in an ice water bath. Refrigerate until
ready to use.

Ice Water Bath:

In order to quickly lower temperature of foods, it is
advisable to use an ice water bath.
To reduce the development of food-spoiling bacteria, hot
foods that are to be refrigerated must be cooled quickly
before refrigeration. Depending on the volume of food to be
cooled, the ice water bath may be set up in the kitchen
sink, or in a stainless steel bowl large enough to hold the
container of food to be cooled. There should be sufficient
space in the sink or the bowl to place enough ice and water
to surround most of the outside surface area of the
container. Place a stainless steel ladle or stirring spoon
in the container of food and stir frequently during the
cooling process to promote rapid cooling.
Certain items, such as ice cream and sorbert bases, need to
be cooled before they are placed in an ice cream freezer to
facilitate the freezing process.

Chocolate Devastation  (Part 1)

chocolate, ice cream

      ----CHOCOLATE RAISIN ICE CREAM----
2 cup raisins
1/2 cup jack daniel's whiskey
8 oz semi-sweet chocolate
2 cup heavy cream
1 cup half & half
2 oz unsweet chocolate
8  egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar
      ----MOCHA MERINGUE----
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
8  egg whites
3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon instant espresso
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/8 teaspoon salt
      ----BITTERSWEET GANACHE----
2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 tablespoon sugar
8 oz semi-sweet chocolate
4 oz unsweetened chocolate

Combine the raisins and whiskey in a plastic container with a tight
fitting lid. Allow to stand at room temperature for 6 hours or
overnight. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler
over medium heat. Place 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, 1/2 cup heavy
cream, and 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate in the top half of the
double boiler. Tightly cover the top with ilm wrap. Heat for 10
minutes, then remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Transfer to
a stainless steel bowl and set aside until needed. Heat the remaining
1 1/2 c heavy cream and the half-and-half in a 2 1/2-qt. saucepan
over medium-high heat. Bring the cream to a boil. While the cream is
heating, place 8 egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar in the bowl of an
electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the eggs on high for 2 to 2
1/2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Continue to beat on
high until slightly thickened and lemon-colored, about 2 1/2 to 3
minutes. (At this point, the cream should be boiling. If not, adjust
the mixer speed to low and continue to mix until the cream boils. If
this is not done, the egg yolks will develop undesirable lumps.) Pour
the boiling cream into the beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine.
Return to the saucepan and heat over medium-high heat, stirring
constantly, until the cream reaches a temperature of 185~, 2-4
minutes. Then pour into the melted chocolate mixture, and stir to
combine. Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath to a temperature of
40-45~, about 15-20 minutes. Line 2, 8" cake pans with enough film
wrap to cover the insides of the pan. Set aside until needed. Fold
the whiskey-soaked raisins and any residual liquid into the cooled
chocolate custard mixture. Freeze in an ice cream freezer following
the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the semi-frozen ice cream
to the 2 cake pans, evenly dividing the ice cream between the two
pans. Use a rubber spatula to spread the ice cream evenly to the
edges of the pans. Tightly cover the tops of the pans with film wrap,
then place in the freezer for at least 12 hours before assembling the
cake. See part 2 for rest of directions.

Chocolate Devastation (Part 2)

chocolate, ice cream

1 x no ingredients

MOCHA MERINGUE: Using a 9" cake circle (or cake plate) as a guide,
trace a circle on each of 3 sheets of parchment paper (cut to fit the
baking sheets) with a pencil. Turn each sheet of parchment paper over
and place with the trace mark down on a baking sheet. Preheat the
oven to 250~. Combine together in a sifter the confectioners' sugar,
cornstarch, and cocoa. Sift onto the wax paper and set aside until
needed. Heat 1" of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over
medium-high heat. Place 8 egg whites, 3/4 cup sugar, the espresso
powder, the cream of tartar, and the salt in the top half of the
double boiler. Heat the egg white mixture to a temperature of 120~
while gently and constantly whisking, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer the
mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a balloon whip.
Whisk on high until stiff but not dry, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.
Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to fold in
the sifted dry ingredients. Fill a pastry bag (with no tip) with
about a third of the meringue. Fill a traced circle with meringue:
start in the center and pipe a 1/2" wide spiral toward the ouside of
the circle. Fill the pastry bag again and repeat this procedure with
each of the 2 remaining circles (each circle should be filled with
about a third of the original amount of meringue.) Place the
meringues in the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour. Reduce the oven
temperature to 225~ and bake for an additional 2 hours. Cool on
baking sheets for 30 minutes before handling.
THE GANACHE: Heat 2 cups heavy cream, the butter, and 2 tablespoons
sugar in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir
to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil. Place 8 oz
semi-sweet chocolate and 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate in a
stainless bowl. Pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow
to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Reserve 1 cup of ganache
and set aside at room temperature. Pour the remaining amount of
ganache onto a baking sheet with sides and refrigerate for 35-40
minutes. Pour 1/4 cup of the reserved room-temperature ganache onto
the center of a baked meringue (supported by a cake circle). Remove
an ice-cream disk from the freezer. Unwrap the disk and place it onto
the puddle of ganache. Press down on the ice cream disk gently but
firmly (this will spread the ganache). Fill a pastry bag fitted with
a medium-sized star tip with one-third of the chilled ganache. Pipe
about 28-30 individual vertical strips 1 1/2" long and 3/4" wide--all
the way around the side of the ice cream disk (each strip should be
touching the other, and each strip should also be wider at the base
where it touches the meringue and tapered at the crest where it rises
to the top edge of the ice cream disk). Place this section into the
freezer and repeat the preceding procedure with another meringue and
ice cream disk. Place in the freezer after completion for about 10-15
minutes. Remove a meringue and ice cream section from the freezer.
Pour 1/4 cup of room-temperature ganache onto the center of the ice
cream. Remove the second section from the freezer, and center onto
the first. Press down on the ice cream, gently but firmly, to spread
the ganache. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup of room-temperature genache
onto the top ice cream disk, and onto this ganache place the
remaining baked meringue, once again pressing down gently but firmly
to spread the ganache. Place the Devastation in the freezer for about
10-15 minutes. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium-sized star tip
with the remaining chilled ganache. Remove the Devastation from the
freezer. Starting 1/2" inside the edge of the top meringue, pipe a
ring of about 28-30 individual strips--1 1/2" long and 3/4" wide--all
the way around the top (each strip should be touching the other, and
each strip should also be wider at the point closest to the edge and
tapered at the point closest to the center). Return the completed
Devastation to the freezer for at least 1 hour before serving. To
serve, cut the Devastation with a serrated slicer. Heat the blade of
the slicer under hot running water before making each slice. Allow
the slices to come

Chocolate Dipped Fruits & Nuts

fruits

1  belle bestor
1  bittersweet chocolate

Melt bittersweet chocolate in a double boiler over hot water until
melted and liquid.  Line a cookie sheet with waxed paper and, using
washed and well dried strawberries, orange sections (all pith
removed-membranes left on), banana slices, glazed apricots or
peaches, blanched almonds, pecans, Brazil nuts, etc. Dip into
chocolate, allowing the excess to drip back into the pan.  Place
dipped items on >> waxed paper lined sheets & refrigerate until
chocolate is set. The banana slices have to be totally covered with
chocolate or they will blacken--use a fork to lower them into the
chocolate & then to remove them. The chocolate dipped fruits are >>
gorgeous as they are but sometimes I melt some white chocolate and
put it into a pastry bag with a tiny, plain tip and swirl some white
chocolate over the dark chocolate for an even more dramatic effect.

Chocolate Eggs

candy, holiday, easter

1 1/3 cup hot water
4 cup granulated cane sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
3 oz unsweetened chocolate, chopd
2 tablespoon butter
1  chocolate compound coating

Stir hot water, sugar and corn syrup together in three quart heavy
saucepan. Place over high heat and stir constantly until all sugar
crystals are dissolved. Wash down sides of pan with pastry brush
dipped in hot water. Clip on thermometer and continue cooking without
stirring until temperature reaches 240, washing down sides twice more
as mixture cooks. Remove from heat. Entire cooking process takes
about 12 minutes. As soon as bubbles subside, pour mixture onto
marble slab or cookie sheet. Allow to cool, undisturbed, until
fondant holds the imprint of your finger and feels lukewarm, about
eight minutes. Cut butter in small pieces and scatter over surface.
Pour melted chocolate over fondant. Work the fondant with a scraper,
lifting it up from all sides and keeping the mass in constant motion.
When the fondant is stiff enough to hold the scraper staight up, it
is finished. Knead briefly and place the ball of fondant in a
container. Cover with a damp cloth, then cover the container. Get out
as needed and knead a little before using. Shape into egg shapes and
dip in chocolate coating or real chocolate. From Sweet Thing @5211

Chocolate Ganache

chocolate, deserts

6 oz semisweet chocolate; chopped fine
3/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon butter; unsalted
2 tablespoon sugar

Here are two I found on one of the echoes I host (ILink Chocolate).
Ganache, after all, is merely chocolate mixed with enough cream or
butter to make it spreadable. These are sub-recipes from Mrs. Fields,
I think, but they will work just about anyplace you need a smooth
spreadable chocolate. Bring cream and butter to a simmer. Stir in the
sugar. Pour cream over the chocolate in a bowl. Let stand covered for
5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Let cool to room temp.

Chocolate Gravy

chocolate, american, breakfast

3 tablespoon cocoa
1 cup sugar
2 tablespoon flour
2 cup milk
2 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Mix the cocoa, sugar, and flour together.  Add the milk, making sure
it mixes smoothly.  Heat (medium) and stir constantly until it
thickens. This takes about 8 minutes. Take off of heat. Add butter.
Stir until it is melted and mixed.  Add vanilla and stir until mixed.

Serve hot over buttered biscuits.  Buttered toast will do in a pinch.

Notes: This is an almost lost Ozark classic. It hardly ever shows up
in ethnic or regional cookbooks.

If this cools, it becomes something else: chocolate pudding!

Chocolate gravy is a great way to make sure your kids get their
minimum daily requirement of sugar!

Chocolate Honey Almond Crunch

chocolate, candy

4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup honey
6 oz unsalted butter
8 oz semi-sweet chocolate; chopped into 1/4 pcs
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup water
4 oz unsweetened chocolate; chopped into 1/4 pcs
1/4 cup myer's dark rum

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast 2 cups of almonds on a baking
sheet in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 to 14
minutes. Remove the almonds from the oven and allow to cool to room
temperature. Transfer the almonds to a large dish or other suitable
container and set aside until needed. Melt the butter in a 2 1/2-qt
saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly as it melts so it does
not simmer or boil. As soon as the butter is completely melted, add
the sugar, water, rum, and honey. Increase the heat to medium high.
Heat the mixture to a temperature of 220 degrees, stirring
constantly. Add the untoasted almonds and continue to heat and stir
until the mixture reaches a temperature of 225 degrees. Evenly divide
the honey-almond mixture between the 2 baking sheets. Place the
baking sheets on the top and middle shelves of the preheated oven and
bake until the mixture is evenly caramelized, about 24 to 26 minutes.
Rotate the baking sheets from top to bottom about halfway through the
baking time. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
Combine the semi-sweet and unsweetened chocolate pieces and evenly
divide and sprinkle over the surface of the caramelized hone-almond
mixture. Allow to stand for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to spread the
chocolate throughout the mixture. Evenly divide and sprinkle the
toasted almonds over the chocolate. Place both baking sheets in the
freezer for 20 minutes. Remove the Chocolate Honey Almond Crunch from
the freezer and break into irregular pieces. Store in a sealed
plastic container in the freezer or refrigerator. Yields: About 2 3/4

Chocolate Lasagna

chocolate, deserts

      ----PASTA----
1 3/4 cup flour
2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pinch salt
2  extra large eggs
2 teaspoon vegetable oil
      ----FILLING----
4 cup whole milk ricotta cheese
2 cup heavy cream
6 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon orange zest
2 tablespoon grand marnier
1 pinch salt
12 oz bittersweet chocolate,
1  chopped

Combine the flour, cocoa, and salt in a bowl and make a well in the
center. Add the eggs and oil in the center of the well and mix with a
fork to form the dough. Knead the dough for 15 minutes until it is
smooth and shiny, adding more flour if necessary to keep the dough
from sticking.

Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for half an hour.  Roll the pasta
out by hand or with a machine and cut into eight 4-1/2 x 11-inch
strips. Cook two strips at a time in boiling salted water.  Cook just
20 seconds after the water returns to a boil.  Plunge the noodles
into cold water to stop the cooking.  When cooled, place on towels in
a single layer to drain.

Combine all filling ingredients and mix until smooth. To assemble:
Preheat oven to 425F with the rack in the upper third of the oven.

Generously butter an 8"x11"x2" pan.  Alternate layers of noodles,
cheese filling, and chocolate, ending with a cheese layer.  Bake for
20-25 minutes until the top is lightly colored.  Let the lasagna
stand for 10 minutes to solidify, then serve warm.

Chocolate Marquise

jewish, frozen

10 oz semisweet or bittersweet chocolate,; cut in bits
4 oz sweet butter, cut into small pieces
2 teaspoon powdered (not freeze dried) instant; coffee
2 teaspoon hot water
4 large eggs, separated
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 tablespoon sugar

Dissolve coffee in the hot water. Melt chocolate and butter
together in a medium bowl placed in a pan of barely simmering
water. Or, melt in a microwave on medium (50%) for about 2
minutes and 30 seconds. Stir from time to time to hasten melting.
When chocolate is melted and smooth, whisk in dissolved coffee
powder and egg yolks. Remove from heat and set aside.

In a clean, dry mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar
at medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually sprinkle in the
sugar, beating at high speed until stiff but not dry. (My notes:
Be careful not to overbeat. The texture won't be as silky if egg
whites are too stiff.) Fold 1/4 of egg whites into chocolate
mixture to lighten it. Fold remaining whites into mixture until
completely incorporated. Scrape mousse immediately into prepared
mold (see individual recipes). Refrigerate for at least 4 hours
to set before unmolding. Marquise may be completed, covered, and
refrigerated 2 days ahead of serving, or it may be frozen for up
to 2 months.

to drip back into the bowl. Return the pan to the freezer for 5 minutes.
Remove the pan from the freezer and, using a small metal spatula, spread
additional ganache over the sides of the pan only. Return the pan to the
freezer. Cover the remaining ganache with plastic wrap and reserve at room
temperature for glazing the terrine. Make the dark chocolate mousse: Melt
the chocolate with the butter.  Set aside to cool.

Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let it stand for 5 minutes to softe
the gelatin.
Place the cup with the softened gelatin in a saucepan with enough water to
come halfway up the side of the cup. Heat the gelatin mixture over hot, not
simmering, water. Stir the gelatin frequently for 3 to 4 minutes, or until
the gelatin granules dissolve completely and the mixture is clear. Remove t
pan from the heat. Leave the cup containing the gelatin mixture in the hot
water to keep the gelatin warm until ready to use.
Remove the egg mixture from the mixer stand and, using a large whisk,
quickly whisk the gelatin in by hand. Using a large rubber spatula, gently

Chocolate Mousse Dessert

chocolate

      Chocolate Mousse-----
6 oz semisweet chocolate chips --
1  or chunks
5 tablespoon boiling water
4  eggs -- separated
2 tablespoon dark rum -- (or coffee or
1  liquer
      Graham Cracker Crust-----
15  graham crackers
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup butter -- melted

Put the chocolate in a blender on high for 6 seconds (or so). Scrape
the sides of the blender with a knife. Add the water and blend on
high for 10 seconds.  Then add the yolks and liquer/coffee and blend
until smooth.

Meanwhile, beat the egg ehites to stiffness.

Fold the chocolate into the egg whites.  Pour mousse into cups or
into the graham crakcer crust.  It makes about 4-6 servings.

Break the crackers into a blender and blend into crumbs. Place the
crumbs into a bowl.  Stir in the sugar, cinnamon and add the butter
and mix. Press into a pie plate and chill before adding filling.

I cheated and bought a Keebler shell. I brushed it with egg white and
baked it at 350 for 5 minutes.  I guess you could do that with this
crust, never tried.

Your standard toll-house chocolate works fine for the mousse but the
Ghirardelli chocolate made my knees weak! I also used anisette
instead of rum.

You should have seen my kitchen!  Flour and chocolate EVERYWHERE! At
least I got to lick the bowl

Chocolate Mousse Royale

deserts

12 oz semisweet chocolate
1 cup water
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 cup whipping cream
6  egg yolks

Melt chocolate in top of double boiler, SLOWLY, over hot, not boiling
water.

Combine water, sugar and vanilla and cook syrup until it reaches 230
degrees on a candy thermometer.  Set syrup aside and let it cool to a
warm temperature around 125 degrees.

Meanwhile, whip the cream until it is stiff and refrigerate it. (
kitchen aid, use whip start on 8 ... increase to 10)

Place egg yolks in mixer bowl and beat them for 1 minute. Slowly (
just a fine line of syrup) start adding warm syrup beating all the
while until yolks are thick and cool...approx 5 minutes. (kitchen
aid, use paddle, speed 3)

Slowly beat in the chocolate until it is blended in the yolk mixture.
Slowly beat in the cream until it is thoroughly mixed. (kitchen aid,
use paddle...speed2)

Pour mixture into 8 long stem glasses or pretty desert dishes. Chill
until firm.  Serves 8

Notes.... This mousse is simple, yet a little tricky. The thing to
remember is that the  syrup needs to be warm when beating into the
egg yolks. Then beat the yolks until they are cooled.

* If you are useing this at holiday time, it is wonderful served in
chocolate boxes, or cups

Chocolate Mousse With Rum Soaked Raisins

chocolate, alcohol, puddings, raisin

1/4 cup dark raisins
1/4 cup dark rum
7 oz bittersweet chocolate
1 cup creme fraiche
3  extra-large eggs; separated
1  six ramekins or long-stemmed wine g; oblets.

Several hours (up to 24) ahead, combine the raisins and the rum in a
small bowl, cover tightly with plastic and set aside to soak. Break
the chocolate into pieces and process in a processor until ground
very fine. Heat the creme Fraiche to the boiling point, and with the
motor running, pour it through the feed tube in a steady stream.
Process a few seconds until smooth. Separate the eggs. Add the egg
yolks to the hot chocolate mixture, and process for a few seconds to
incorporate. Transfer to a large bowl, stir  in the drained raisins,
and cool completely. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites
until stiff but not dry. Scoop about one quarter of the beaten whites
onto the chocolate mixture, and using a large rubber spatula, stir
them into the mixture. Gently and quickly fold in the remaining
whites. Pour the mousse into the serving dishes, cover tightly with
plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and as long as 12
hours. Adding the yolks to the hot chocolate mixture cooks them
slightly and gives a creamier texture to the mousse, which is best
served the day it is prepared. Decorate with chocolate curls or extra
rum-soaked raisins. From: Jody Prival Busted and entered for you by:

Chocolate Pasta

pasta, chocolate, deserts

      ----PASTA----
1 3/4 cup flour
1/4 cup cocoa powder
2  egg
4 tablespoon ; water
      ----CHAMPAGNE CREAM SAUCE----
6  egg yolk
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup champagne

Mix flour and cocoa well.  Mound on your work surface or in a large
bowl. Make a deep well in the center of the mound and break the eggs
into it. Beat the eggs in there with a fork, adding about 2 Tbsp
water. Using a circular motion, draw the flour and cocoa into the
center. Toss in another Tbsp of Water.  Stir with your fork until all
the flour is moistened. Add a little more water as needed. You're
gonna have to finish mixing by hand. Pat the dough into a ball. Clean
off your work surface, and flour it. Knead the dough for about 10
minutes, or until the dough becomes silky and elastic. Cover the
dough and let it rest for half an hour so the gluten can activate in
the flour.  Roll out 1/4 of the dough at a time, the same way you
would any pasta. A machine makes this really easy. I prefer to let
the pasta dry (at least a little!) before cooking. This will make 4
to 5 cups of cooked pasta---plenty for dessert. Serve in wine glasses
with a warm raspberry sauce and chilled whipped cream. Combine yolks
and sugar over a double-boiler.  Whisk constantly for about 10
minutes, until the mixture begins to thicken.  Before it turns to a
thick custard, pour in the room-temperature champagne all at once. As
it foams up, whisk lightly, and continue to stir as it thickens.
Remove from heat. Serve warm over chilled berries, or over
Cinnamon-nutmeg pasta & top with berries. Variation: Use 2 cups
flour, omit the cocoa. Instead, add 1 tsp each cinnamon and
freshly-ground nutmeg.  I served this one with a Champagne Cream
sauce and fresh raspberries and blueberries.

Chocolate Peanut Butter Scones

breads, chocolate

2 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar, brown
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, sweet; chilled
3/4 cup peanut butter, creamy
1/4 cup milk
2  egg
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup peanuts, unsalted; chopped
1 1/2 oz chocolate, bittersweet

Approx. Cook Time: 0:17
Break chocolate into 8 equal pieces. Preheat oven to 375F. In a
large bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and
salt. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and distribute them over the
flour mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives used scissors
fashion, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
In a small bowl, stir together the peanut butter mixture to the flour
mixture and knead until combined.  Knead in the peanuts. Pat the
dough out into a 1/2-inch thickness on a cutting board. Using a
floured 2-1/2 in. to 3-in. diameter crinkled round biscuit cutter,
cut out rounds from the dough. Gather the scraps together and repeat
until all the dough is used and there are 16 round.  Place 8 of the
rounds on an ungreased baking sheet. Top each round with a piece of
the chocolate and one of the remaining circles of dough. Press the
edges gently to seal. Bake for 17-19 minutes, or until lightly
browned.  Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool 5 minutes.
Using a spatula, transfer the scones to the wire rack to cool. Serve
warm or cool completely and store in an airtight container. VARIATION
(Randy's Preference):  Make the dough as above, omitting bittersweet
chocolate, substituting 1/2 c. unsalted peanuts for the chopped
peanuts and kneading in 3/4 c. semisweet chocolate chips at the same
time. Put the dough into a 9-inch diameter circle on a baking sheet.
With a serrated knife, cut into 8 wedges.  Bake 20-22 minutes, or
until a cake tested or toothpick inserted into the center of a scone
comes out clean. Cool as above and recut into wedges, if necessary.

Chocolate Pecan Pralines - Prudhomme

candy

1 1/2  sticks unsalted butter
1 cup sugar
1 cup packed, light brown sugar
1 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup coarsely chopped pecans
2 cup whole pecan halves
2 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

NOTE: Chocolate chips should be chilled.
Assemble all the ingredients and utensils before starting to cook.
(Measure out the chocolate chips and keep them refregerated until just
before needed.)  You will need a large, heavy-bottomed aluminum pot or
skillet with deep sides, a long-handled metal whisk or spoon, 2 large
spoons (or an ice cream scoop with a manual release) and a very
lightly greased cookie sheet. Melt the butter in the pot over high
heat; add the sugars, milk, cream and chopped pecans.  cook 5
minutes, whisking constantly.  reduce heat to medium, and continue
cooking and whisking 10 minutes.
Add the pecan halves and continue whisking and cooking until done,
about 8 to 10 minutes.  (If the mixture smokes excessively toward end
of cooking time, lower thge heat.) Stir in vanilla. then immediately
drop about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips into about one-sixth of the
batter. Stir quickly and just enough to cover some of the chips with
batter but not nenough to allow the chips to melt.  Quickly drop the
chocolate mixture onto the cookie sheet by heaping spoonfuls, using
the second spoon to push the batter off the first (or use ice cream
scoop); each praline should be about 2 inches in diameter and 1/2
inch thick. repeat with remaining mixture, stirring briefly before
adding more chocolate chips.  The cooled pralines should be light
brown, opaque, somewhat chunky and crumbly. LAGNIAPPE: To clean the
pot and utensils, boil water in the pot with the utensils in it. This
will melt the batter off. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen.

Chocolate Pots De Creme ( Mw )

deserts, microwave

1/4 cup light cream
1 oz german cooking chocolate *
3/4 teaspoon sugar
1  dash salt
1  beaten egg yolk
1/8 teaspoon vanilla
1  whipped cream (opt.)

*    German Chocolate should be corasely chopped.

In a small nonmetal bowl stir together light cream, chopped chocolate,
sugar and salt.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100% power about 1 minute
or till chocolate is melted, stirring after 30 seconds. Stir about
HALF of the hot mixture into the beaten egg yolk. Return all to the
bowl, mixing well. Micro-cook, uncovered, on 50% power for 1 to 2
minutes or till thickened, stirring every 15 seconds.  Stir in
vanilla. Pour into pot de creme cup or 6 ounce custard cup. Cover and
chill for several hours or till firm. Garnish with whipped cream, if
desired.

NOTE: SELECTING THE RIGHT CHOCOLATE: You'll find three basic types of
chocolate in the baking supplies department of most supermarkets--
semisweet chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, and sweet chocolate. The
semisweet chocolate is made from chocolate that is just slight
sweetened with sugar. Unsweetened chocolate is the original baking or
cooking chocolate and has no added flavorings or sugar. And sweet
chocolate, such as the German cooking chocolate used in the Chocolate
Pots de Creme recipe, is chocolate mixed with sugar and sometimes
additional cocoa butter or flavorings.

Chocolate Raisin Bread Pudding W/White Chocol

deserts

      ----BREAD PUDDING----
10 slice raisin bread; about 1 lb
3 cup half-and-half
2 cup whole milk
6 oz milk chocolate; coarse chopd
4 large eggs
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup mandarin orange liqueur; or other orange liqueur
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  dash salt
5 oz bittersweet chocolate; coarsely chopped
      ----CREME FRAICHE SAUCE----
10 oz creme fraiche or sour cream
2 1/2 oz white chocolate; finely grated or shaved
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

Preheat oven to 300 F. Lay the bread slices on the upper rack of the
oven in a single layer. Toast 5 to 7 minutes or until crisp and very
light golden brown. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature.
Cut or break into 1-inch-square pieces (you should have 9 or 10 cups
of toasted bread cubes) and set aside, uncovered, in a very large
bowl for up to 2 days, if desired.

In a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the half-and-half, milk
and milk chocolate. Heat over moderately low heat for 3 to 4 minutes,
stirring frequently, until the chocolate just melts. Mix well, remove
from the heat and cool slightly.

Preheat oven to 350 F. Generously grease a shallow 4-quart glass
mixing bowl or casserole dish; set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, liqueur, vanilla extract and
salt together until smooth and fully blended. Slowly add the reserved
chocolate-cream mixture, whisking constantly until smooth and
thoroughly mixed. Pour over the bread cubes and toss gently. Let
stand at room temperature for approximately 1 hour, pressing the
bread down into the liquid every 15 to 20 minutes to promote even
saturation. Add the bittersweet chocolate and mix gently.

Turn the mixture into the prepared bowl and place on the middle rack
of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 325 F and
bake 55 minutes to 1 hour longer, rotating the baking dish from time
to time, until the outside edges are slightly firm and the center
barely jiggles when shook.  Remove from the oven and let stand at
room temperature for 10 to 12 minutes before serving.

To make the White Chocolate Creme Fraiche Sauce: In a medium bowl,
combine the creme fraiche, white chocolate and cinnamon; mix well.
The sauce can be prepared up to 3 days in advance and stored in a
tightly sealed container in the refrigerator. Remove from the
refrigerator at least 30 minutes before serving.

To serve, spoon the warm pudding into serving bowls and drizzle with
the sauce. Serve immediately.

To reheat just a portion of the bread pudding: Using a shallow baking
pan, arrange the desired amount in a 1-inch-thick layer and sprinkle
with hot water. Cover loosely with foil and warm in a 350 F oven 7 to
10 minutes or until warmed through.

on high for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl,
then beat on high until slightly thickened and lemon-colored, 2 1/2
to 3 minutes. (At this point, the cream should be boiling. If not,
adjust the mixer speed to low and continue to mix until the cream
boils. If this is not done, the egg yolks will develop undesirable
lumps.) Pour the boiling cream into the beaten egg yolks and whisk to
combine. Return to the saucepan and heat over medium-high heat,
stirring constantly. Bring to a temperature of 185 degrees, 2 to 4
minutes, then pour over the chocoate mixture, add crushed hazelnuts,
and stir to combine. Cool in an ice-water bath to a temperature of 40
to 45 degrees, about 15 minutes. en the custard is cold, freeze in an

Chocolate Roses

chocolate, valentine

10 oz chocolate (chopped chunks
1  or chips)
1/3 cup light corn syrup

Chocolate modeling clay is made by combining melted chocolate and
light corn syrup. American pastry chefs invented the recipe and have
been using this delicious edible clay to make garnishes and unique
decorations. Here is their secret!

Note: the chocolate can be substituted with almond bark, or colored
candy disks to create different colored flowers

Clay:

Melt he chocolate in a microwave for 1 minute. Stir. If chocolate is
not completely melted, return to the microwave for 30 seconds at a
time and stir until smooth. If you don't have a microwave, place the
chocolate in the top of a double broiler over hot water and stir
until melted. When the chocolate is melted, add the corn syrup and
blend. Pour the mixture onto a waxed paper sheet.Spread the chocolate
with your fingers until it's about 1/2 inch thick. Cover loosely with
waxed paper and let it stiffen for at least a couple hours or
overnight. The chocolate will become very pliable.

Making a Chocolate Rose:

Have the kids roll 10 marble-sized balls out of the chocolate clay.
Place the balls on a waxed paper sheet, about 1 inch apart. Place
another waxed paper sheet on top. Big or little thumbs can press each
marble into a flat disk (about the size of a quarter). Use some
pressure!

To form the rose:

Remove 1 disk and curl it into a "teepee" shape, narrow at the top and
wider at the bottom. Wrap the next disk around the opening of the
teepee and the third disk at the back of the teepee. This is the rose
bud. Continue adding disks which will look like petals. Continue to
layer them to create a rose in bloom. Roses can be used as edible
decorations for a cake or to create a basketful of blooms. They will
harden after a few days and can be saved by storing in a cool, dry
place.

Since this recipe is the consistency of modeling clay, you can mold
any shape you want.

Important note: Adult supervision and participation is required for
this activity.

Chocolate Roulage

deserts

9 oz sweet cooking chocolate
9 oz semi-sweet chocolate
13 cup cold water
8  eggs; separated
1 cup sugar
1  cocoa
1 1/2 cup whipping cream
3 tablespoon confectioners' sugar; sifted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Oil the bottom of a 15 1/z x lO 1/2h x 1-inch jelly roll pan. Cut a
piece of waxed paper to fit the width of pan and extend about 1 inch
over ends. Place the chocolates and the water in the top of a double
boiler over hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon until the chocolate
is melted, then cool. Place the egg yolks in a large mixer bowl and
beat slightly with the mixer, Add the sugar gradually, beating
constantly until all the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is thick
and of a batter consistency. Stir in the chocolate with a rubber
spatula until well combined and free of streaks. Beat the egg whites
until stiff peaks form. Fold about 1/3 of the egg whites into the
chocolate mixture thoroughly to lighten, then fold in the remaining
egg whites carefully but completely with a rubber spatula. Spread the
batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake in a preheated 350 - degree
oven for 18 minutes. Remove from oven and cover top with damp towels.
Let stand for 30 minutes or until cooled. Remove the towels
carefully, then loosen by lifting the extending ends of waxed paper.
Place cocoa in a fine sieve and dust top generously. Place a piece of
waxed paper over the top, then place a cookie sheet on top and
invert. Peel the waxed paper carefully from the cake. Place the cream
in a large mixer bowl and beat with an electric mixer until soft
peaks form. Sprinkle in the confectioners' sugar and beat until
stiff. Stir in the vanilla. Spread the whipped cream evenly over the
cake. Roll the cake from the long side, as for a jelly roll, directly
onto a serving tray. Roll with care as this cake is extremely tender.
Dust the top generously with cocoa. You may refrigerate the roll for
several hours before serving. Cut into slices to serve.

3 oz chocolate, bitter
2 1/2 cup sugar, powdered
1 1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla

Melt butter with chocolate in saucepan.  Add other ingredients (except
vanilla) and cook 20-25 minutes over medium heat. Mixture will slowly

NOTES:

*  Hot fudge sauce for ice cream -- This is the fudgiest and best
sauce you'll ever taste. The recipe has been passed down in our
family for years and years.

*  This sauce becomes like fudge candy when refrigerated, and it's
hard to keep from poking your finger in it for a taste. Simply reheat
in a saucepan to melt it down.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

6 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoon sifted cornstarch
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
1 cup half-and-half
1 cup evaporated skim milk
2/3 cup whole milk
2  jumbo egg yolks  lightly beaten
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
      ----OPTIONAL TOPPING----
1/4 cup heavy cream; whipped
1 tablespoon chopped blanched pistachios  or -
6  candied violets

In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and gelatin,
pressing out all lumps.  Add the half-and-half, evaporated skim milk
and whole milk; whisk vigorously to blend. Set the pan over
moderately low heat and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden,
until the mixture just boils and is thickened and smooth, about 10
minutes.

Blend a little of the hot mixture into the beaten egg yolks, then
stir the warmed egg yolks back into the pan. Cook over moderately low
heat, stirring constantly, for 3 to 4 minutes.  The mixture must not
boil or the eggs will scramble.  Remove from the heat and stir in the
vanilla. Set the saucepan on a rack to cool for 10 minutes, stirring

plastic wrap, then refrigerate at least 5 hours, or overnight.

Serve as is or top each serving with a little of the whipped cream and

Chocolate Stuffed Peanut Butter Scones (Randa

breads, chocolate, deserts

2 cup flour
1/2 cup lt brown sugar, firmly packed
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup unsalted butter, chilled
3/4 cup peanut butter, creamy
1/4 cup milk
2 large eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup unsalted peanuts, chopped
1 1/2 oz bittersweet chocolate, broken into; 8 equal pieces

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a lg bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and
salt. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and distribute them over the
flour mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives used scissors
fashion, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
In a sm bowl, stir together the peanut butter mixture to the flour
mixture and knead until combined.  Knead in the peanuts.

Pat the dough out into a 1/2-inch thickness on a cutting board. Using
a floured 2-1/2 in. to 3-in. diameter crinkled round biscuit cutter,
cut out rounds from the dough. Gather the scraps togvether and repeat
until all the dough is used and there are 16 round. Place 8 of the
rounds on an ungreased baking sheet. Top each round with a piece of
the chocolate and one of the remaining circles of dough. Press the
edges gently to seal. Bake for 17-19 minutes, or until lightly
browned. Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool 5 minutes.
Using a spatula, transfer the scones to the wire rack to cool. Serve
warm or cool completely and store in an airtight container.

VARIATION (Randy's Preference):  Make the dough as above, omitting
bittersweet chocolate, substituting 1/2 c unsalted peanuts for the
chopped peanuts and kneading in 3/4 c semisweet chocolate chips at
the same time. Put the dough into a 9-inch diameter circle on a
baking sheet. With a serrated knife, cut into 8 wedges. Bake 20-22
minutes, or until a cake tested or toothpick inserted into the center
of a scone comes out clean. Cool as above and recut into wedges, if
necessary.

Chocolate Toffee

candy

1 cup sugar
2/3 cup light corn syrup
1 1/2 cup half-and-half
1 1/2 oz unsweetened chocolate  melted
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 pinch salt

COMBINE THE SUGAR, CORN SYRUP, and 1/2 cup of cream in a large
saucepan set over moderate heat. Stir the mixture until the sugar
dissolves completely. Insert a candy thermometer, reduce the heat to
low, and cook the syrup, stirring frequently, until the thermometer
registers 238F. Blend in another 1/2 cup of the cream, which will
cause the temperature to drop, and continue to cook and stir until
the thermometer reaches 236F or until a bit of the hot toffee dropped
into a little cold water forms a soft, pliable ball. Mix in the
remaining 1/2 cup cream and the melted chocolate. Cook the toffee,
stirring constantly, lest it scorch. Cook toffee until the mixture
becomes quite thick: A drop of it should firm up quickly in cold
water. (NOTE: Even though the temperature of the toffee may not
exceed 230F, if it firms in cold water, remove the pan from the heat
at once.) Quickly mix in the vanilla and salt, then pour the toffee
into a well-buttered 8-by-8-by-2-inch pan. Cool the toffee
completely, then cut it into 1-inch squares. Wrap each one in waxed
paper or plastic wrap.

smoothing the top down. Pre-heat the oven to Gas Mark 4, 350F, 180C,
and bake for about 25 minutes, until the cake is brown and has shrunk
away from the sides of the tin.

To make the butter cream filling, all you do is either beat together
the butter, icing sugar and coffee until you have a smooth cream.
When the cake is ready, turn it out onto a rack, and when it has
cooled, split it into two and sandwich it together with the butter
cream filling. Alternatively, fill it with apricot jam and spread the
butter cream over the cake and decorate with the whole hazelnuts.

Chocolate Truffle Tart With Raspberries

deserts

1 cup flour, all purpose
1/2 cup sugar, granulated
1/2 cup cocoa powder
3 oz butter; chilled
1  egg
6 oz semisweet chocolate; chopped
2 cup whipping cream
2  raspberry boxes; i assume they mean pints,

CHOCOLATE PASTRY: Combine flour, sugar & cocoa in work bowl of a food
processor. Pulse 2 or 3 times to aerate. Chop the butter into pieces
and distribute over the flour. Process until mixture reassembles
coarse meal, do NOT overprocess. With motor running, drop in whole
egg (no we do not mean the shell too) through the feed tube. Process
very briefly - do not let the dough come together or your pastry will
be tough. Remove the dough from work bowl and set aside at room
temperature until the filling is made. TRUFFLE FILLING: Place the
chopped chocolate in a medium size bowl, bring the cream to boil over
medium-high heat. Pour over the chocolate and whisk till all the
chocolate is melted. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
set. Preheat the oven to 375F. Work the chocolate pastry with your
hands and press it into an 8" or (" tart pan with removable bottom;
try to get an even thickness. Chill for 20 minutes. Prick the bottom
of the pastry with a fork. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25
minutes. Cool completely. TO ASSEMBLE: Remove the tart gently form
the pan and set it on a platter. Spoon over pipe the truffle filling
into the shell and smooth the surface. Arrange the raspberries over
the top in concentric circles. Serve at room Temperature for the
fullest flavour. Anne's note: I would not make this on very hot days
as the filling might melt. SERVES: 6

Chocolate Truffles (French-Style)

candy

3 lb chocolate (semi-sweet or semi-bitte; rsweet)
1 quart cream, very heavy
1/2 lb butter, sweet (i.e. unsalted butter; )
1  cocoa powder

Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler.  Do not cook the
chocolate. This should be done SLOWLY over minimum heat.

Boil the cream.  Once the chocolate is completely melted and the
cream just boiled, combine in the top of the double boiler. Take off
the top pan from the water, and (off heat) mix until completely
combined. Keep stirring until it is relatively cool. Allow to sit
until it is cool enough to put into a refrigerator.

Refrigerate overnight (NO SHORT CUTS HERE!!!).

The next morning, melt this wonderful mixture again in a double
boiler. When it is completely melted again, mix in the butter until
it is completely absorbed. Whip, either with a hand whisk or a very
slow electric gizmo, until the butter is completely absorbed and the
mixture is cool again.  This can take an hour or longer, depending
upon the chocolate, etc. Let cool and refrigerate overnight once more
(this is not as critical as the first cooling; a few hours will be
enough).

Heat once again and whip until cool.   Refrigerate until it is thick
enough to pipe through a pastry bag. Using a 1/2 nozzle, make little
balls on a big piece of parchment paper that has cocoa powder spread
on it. Roll in the powder. Keep chilled until just before serving.
Let them return to just above room temperature before eating.

NOTES:

*  French-style chocolate confectionery -- For those of you who are
crazy enough about chocolate to go to the extremes that I do, here is
the recipe for the chocolate truffles that I make. The formula is
taken from Paul Bocuse's "French Cooking," but the directions are my
own.

*  If you like Grand Marnier or Kahlua or rum or whatever in your
chocolate, the last melting step is the time to add. I think it's a
small but forgivable sin myself.

*  I recommend Guittard chocolate.  You can buy their semisweet chips
in 12 ounce bags.  You can also buy it in 10 pound bars. You can also
buy 10-pound bars of Guittards "French Vanilla Semi bittersweet"
which is so good you might eat all of it before you cook with it.
Guittard makes 5 types of bittersweet if you like you chocolate
really bitter. I use Hershey's Cocoa. Still the best for my taste.

*  Use genuine, real-live, honest "heavy cream" and not
ultra-pasteurized whipping cream.  Try a wholesale dairy. I only use
Challenge Sweet Butter. Under no circumstances should you use
anything but unsalted butter in this recipe.

: Difficulty:  quite difficult (melting the chocolate 3 times requires
tremendous care).
: Time:  3 or 4 hours of preparation during a 3-day period.
: : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Chocolate Truffles Ii

candy

2 lb dark, coating chocolate
6 oz chocolate, unsweetened, baking (or; more, to taste)
3 oz butter, unsalted
1 1/4 cup cointreau

Chop the chocolate.  Melt together with the butter over simmering
water. Stir continuously with a rubber spatula. Don't let water get
into the chocolate.

Warm the Cointreau to the same temperature as the chocolate. Slowly
blend the Cointreau into the chocolate (still over the water). Stir
continuously. Do this slowly (as if you were making Hollandaise).
Using an electric mixer, beat the mixture until cool and somewhat
thickened. (Takes about 5 minutes; you'll need a good mixer.)

Line a large baking sheet (11 x 17) with wax paper. Pour in the
truffle mix. (This will fill the pan.) Chill in the refrigerator
until solid (several hours).

Use a pizza cutter to cut the stuff into strips (peel off the wax
paper first), then into squares.  Take each one, mash it in your
palm, and roll in cocoa. Chill some more.

I recommend Merckens Yucatan or Lindt Extra Bittersweet for the dark
coating chocolate. In place of the Cointreau, try substituting other
liqueurs (Chambord, Amaretto, Kahlua) and coatings (chopped roasted
almonds, finely chopped candied orange peel, coffee beans run through
a nutmeg grinder, etc.)

Truffles rolled in cocoa are "classic", here are some rough and ready
instructions for coating anything with chocolate, abstracted from
"Making Chocolates" by Alec Leaver, published in 1975 by Weathervane
Books by arrangement with Michael Joseph Ltd.  (The book is out of
print.)

Melt some chocolate over hot water, let it cool slowly until it just
thickens (80-84 F). Now warm the chocolate gently and slowly until it
thins slightly. The temperature should be above 85, but below 91.
This maximum working temperature is absolutely crucial. The
temperature of the room you work in should not exceed 70.

Pre-bottom all centers, that is, smear a little couverature on what
will be the bottom of the center with the back of a spoon and place
it, bottom side up, on a plate. This lets you check that the
couverature is properly tempered.

After the bases have set and hardened a little, stir the couverature
thoroughly, trying not to get too many air-bubbles in. Drop a center
into the couverature, bottom down and, with an ordinary fork,
slightly warmed, push it down to submerge it fully. Immediately, pick
it out with the fork, tap the fork on the side of the bowl in order
to settle the chocolate, and wipe any excess from underneath the
fork. Transfer the center to a sheet of wax paper. Stir the
couverature after depositing each center to keep it well mixed.

NOTES:

*  Classic chocolate confectionery -- These are as good, or better,
than anything you can buy in a store.

*  The basis of the truffle centre is ganache paste, a mixture of
melted chocolate and warm cream well blended and cooled until it
hardens. Orange, honey, peppermint, rum or vanilla can be added to
give flavor, but it is important that the final mixture should be
hard enough to be moulded to shape and be capable of standing up to
being coated with chocolate.

*  The texture of ganache paste depends upon the kinds of cream and
chocolate and the proportions in which they are used. Plain chocolate
is harder than milk chocolate, so more cream can be added to it.
Single cream is thinner than double so must be used in smaller
quantities. Incorporating cream or other liquids fulfills two
functions: it softens the chocolate and it gives flavor. After the
centre has been made and moulded to shape, it is coated with
chocolate to seal it and help to keep it moist. It is then rolled in
a final decorative coating, and this can cocoa sweetened with a
little icing sugar, or chopped mixed nuts.

: Difficulty:  moderate for classic truffles, quite difficult for
coated centers.
: Time:  most of a day.
: Precision:  measure carefully.

Chocolate Truffles Iv

chocolate

190 gm sugar
75 gm powdered chocolate
125 ml whipping cream
60 gm unsalted butter

1.  Put all ingredients in a solid sauce-pan, mix while bringing
slowly to the boil.

2.  Boil gently.

3.  After two minutes you will have a wonderful icing for cakes, and a
sauce for ice cream.

4.  After six minutes (or a little longer if you want your truffles
harder) take sauce-pan off heat and allow the mixture to cool
slightly. At this point you can add dark rum or any other liqueur if
you wish. Cool in the refrigerator for about one hour.

5.  Form into balls about the size of large marbles and roll them in
powdered chocolate. Cool to room temperature, or chill.

Author's Notes: I found this recipe in the flight magazine for a trip
from London to Vienna. I think Vienna is probably the best place in
the world for cakes and sweets. Whatever you do, never go to Vienna
if you are on a diet. This is also the only recipe I have ever
collected that is in cups rather than grams!

Difficulty    : easy. Precision
: measure the ingredients.

Chocolate Turnovers

deserts

1  sheet frozen puff pastry,
1  thawed -- 9-1/2 square
1  egg yolk
2 tablespoon heavy cream
2 1/4 oz semisweet chocolate -- cut
1  into 9 pieces

Heat oven to 450#161#F. Place puff pastry on a lightly floured
surface. Sprinkle pastry with a little more flour and roll out to
form a 12-inch square. Brush away excess flour and trim edges to make
a perfect square.

Cut puff pastry into nine 3-1/2-inch squares and transfer them to a
parchment lined baking sheet. Discard excess.

In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolk and heavy cream. Neatly
brush a little of the egg wash along two adjacent edges of each
square. Place a piece of chocolate just below the center of each
square and fold down the unwashed edges to enclose chocolate and form
a triangle. Using your fingers, gently but firmly press puff pastry
edges together to seal.

Place baking sheet in freezer for 20 minutes, or until pastry is
chilled. Remove from freezer and brush tops liberally with remaining
egg wash. Place in oven and bake until triangles are puffed and
golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Chocolate Vanilla Double Dip Creme Brulee

deserts

      ----CUSTARD----
1/2 cup milk
2 cup heavy (whipping) cream
1/2 cup sugar
2  vanilla beans, split
1  lengthwise
6  egg yolks - room temperature
1  blended with fork
      ----CHOCOLATE MOUSSE----
5 oz bittersweet or semisweet
1  chocolate, coarsely chopped
4 oz unsalted butter, chopped
4 large eggs* separated, at room
1  temperature
4 tablespoon sugar
1  plus
6 tablespoon sugar for caramelizing
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar

For the custard; place the milk, cream and sugar in a heavy medium
sized saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla beans into the
mixture and add the split skins too. Bring to a boil over medium
heat. Remove from heat and steep for at least one hour or until the
mixture cools to room temperature. Discard the split skins of the
beans.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Place eight three inch ramekins in a
large baking pan.  Pour enough water into the pan to come three
quarters of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Remove the ramekins
and place the baking pan with the water in the oven to preheat for
about 15 minutes.

Whisk the six egg yolks into the cooled milk mixture. Strain through
a fine sieve into the ramekins, filling only about half full (leave
room to add the chocolate mousse layer). Place the ramekins in the
preheated prepared pan.  Bake in the preheated oven until set and a
knife inserted into the custard comes out dry. *no time stated in
recipe* Remove dishes from the water bath and cool to room
temperature.

For the chocolate mousse: melt the chocolate and butter in the top of
a double boiler over gently simmering water until chocolate is smooth,
stirring occasionally. Cool until tepid, about 25 minutes.

Using an electric mixer, beat the four egg yolks with two tablespoons
of the sugar until a slowly dissolving ribbon forms as the beaters
are lifted. Fold the tepid chocolate into the yolks.

Using a clean dry beater and bowl, beat the four egg whites and the
cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add the remaining two
tablespoons of sugar one at a time and continue beating until barely
stiff. Gently fold half of the whites into the chocolate mixture,
fold in the remaining whites.

Spoon the chocolate mousse over the cooled baked custards, smoothing
the tops with a spatula.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at
least 4 to 6 hours or overnight. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes
before serving.

To serve, preheat the broiler (or use stovetop salamander or small
propane torch).  Sprinkle a little less than one tablespoon sugar
over each dessert.

Place about two inches below the heat source and broil until the
sugar is melted and caramelized, about two minutes, watching
CAREFULLY. Serve immediately.

NOTE:uncooked egg yolks may be contaminated with salmonella and
should be avoided by young children, the elderly and anyone with
immune system deficiencies.

Chocolate Velvet Ice Cream

deserts, dairy

2/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup cocoa
3  egg yolks
2 2/3 cup cream
1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate

"Also reminiscent of frozen mousse is this decadently rich chocolate

Chocolate Walnut Rum Balls

alcohol, candy, holiday, resort

1 cup walnuts, ground or  finely chopped
2 cup grated german's sweet or  bitterswe; et chocolate
1 1/2 cup sifted confectioner's sugar
4 tablespoon rum
1  cocoa powder

Combine nuts, sugar, and chocolate. Moisten with rum to form a stiff
dough. Form into small balls and roll in cocoa to coat.

This recipe is not only simple, it's flexible. It can be made with
other kinds of liquor (amaretto, sherry, and Southern Comfort work
well), nuts (almonds or pecans, for instance) and coatings (ground
nuts, finely grated coconut, etc.) and always comes out tasting
great. Adding small chunks of nut for texture is also effective.
These usually disappear in a hurry.

This is a recipe for rum balls that I got from Monica Fischler in
Guayaquil, Ecuador in 1974. It's very simple, requires no cooking,
and is almost impossible to foul up.

Chocolate-Dipped Strawmberries

candy

1 pint strawberries with stems on (prefera; bly a
1  long-stemmed variety), washed and
1  patted dry
4 oz semisweet chocolate
1 tablespoon cooking oil

Spread strawberries on a working surface with wax-paper-covered tray
nearby. You will also need one or two bamboo skewers or other picks.

In the top of a double boiler over hot water, melt the chocolate with
the cooking oil, stirring to mix thoroughly. (The cooking oil will
add a beautiful shine to the completed sweet.) Place melted chocolate
near working surface, but keep chocolate warm.

One at a time, insert the skewer in the stem end of a strawberry and
dip into the chocolate.  Lift out and shake any excess chocolate back
into the pot.  Place the strawberry on the wax paper and continue
with the remaining berries.  The strawberries should set for about 10
minutes before being served.

Chocolate-dipped strawberries can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours,
during which time the chocolate will harden.

Chocolate-Fresh Spearmint Ice Cream

ice cream

1 1/2 cup whipping cream
1 1/2 cup milk
2/3 cup sugar
3  egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 oz semisweet chocolate
2 oz unsweetened chocolate
1 cup fresh spearmint leaves*
2 tablespoon fresh spearmint leaves; chopped

*Leaves are "hardpacked:" measure by pressing down on leaves in
measuring cup with your fingers.

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan or double boiler over medium-low heat,
stir and heat the cream, milk, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
Do not boil.

In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks lightly. While whisking, pour 1
cup of the hot cream mixture into the bowl, then pour the egg mixture
back into the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir
constantly with a wooden spoon (don't let the mixture boil; it could
curdle) for about 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and coats
the spoon. To test for doneness, dip a metal spoon into the mixture
and run your finger across the back. The custard is done when your
finger leaves a clear, clean trail. A candy thermometer should read
175-180 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
vanilla.

While heating the ice-cream base, melt the chocolate in a double
boiler over hot but not simmering water, stirring occasionally.

Off heat, pour about 1 cup of the prepared hot ice-cream base into the
melted chocolate and whisk until well blended. Pour the chocolate
mixture back into the remaining vanilla base and whisk again. Stir in
the hard-packed mint leaves. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for
at least 1 hour. The longer it is refrigerated, the stronger the mint
flavor will be.

Strain the mixture and add the chopped mint leaves. Pour the mixture
into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

Chocolate-Hazelnut Truffles Part 1

candy

      ----HAZELNUT PRALINE----
1 cup whole hazelnuts
1 cup sugar
      ----TRUFFLES----
8 oz semisweet chocolate; finely chopped
1/2 cup unsalted butter; chilled and cut into 8 pi
3 tablespoon brewed coffee
1 tablespoon hazelnut liqueur (frangelico
2/3 cup hazelnut praline
1  unsweetened cocoa powder
      ----COATING----
12 oz semisweet chocolate; finely chopped
6 tablespoon hazelnut praline

Make the praline: 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the
hazelnuts on a baking sheet. Toast for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the
smell permeates the air. To see if the nuts are toasted, cut one in
half; it should be golden brown in the center. Remove from the oven
and let cool slightly. To remove the skins, place the nuts on a towel
and rub; the skins will slip off.

2. Lightly oil a sheet of foil; set aside.

3. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the sugar, stirring
occasionally. It should start to melt after about 6 minutes. The
sugar will be lumpy and granular, and look like a mistake.
Persevere!. Within the next few minutes, those lumps will melt into a
smooth, amber-colored liquid. Lower the heat and stir in the toasted
hazelnuts, coating the nuts thoroughly. The mixture will be very
sticky. Immediately scrape the mixture with a metal spoon (do not use
a rubber spatula) onto the foil, spreading it out. Use a metal spoon
dipped in water to flatten it. The praline will become brittle and
difficult to pour as soon as you remove it form the heat, and you
will not be able to scrape every last drop from the pan -- don't
worry. (To clean the pan, soak it in hot, soapy water. The sugar will
dissolve.)

4. Let the praline cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Break
it into pieces and put it in a food processor. Pulse to chop as
finely as possible into a lumpy powder. You should have 2 cups; the
praline can keep idefinitely in an airtight container in the freezer.

Make the truffles: 5. In a microwave-safe medium bowl, combine the
chopped chocolate and the butter. Heat on high for 1 minute. Stir
until smooth. If the chocolate is still fairly solid, heat for
another 30 seconds. Stir the mixture until smooth. If there still
seem to be several unmelted pieces of chocolate, heat again for about
20 seconds, and then stir.

6. Add the coffee and hazelnut liqueur and stir until smooth.

7. Add the hazelnut praline and mix in thoroughly.

Chocolate-Stuffed Peanut Butter Scones

breads, chocolate, deserts

2 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar, brown, light
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, sweet; chilled
3/4 cup peanut butter, creamy
1/4 cup milk
2  egg
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup peanuts, unsalted; chopped
1 1/2 oz chocolate, bittersweet; brok

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, stir together the
flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into
1/2-inch cubes and distribute them over the flour mixture. With a
pastry blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in the butter
until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, stir
together the peanut butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla. Add the peanut
butter mixture to the flour mixture and knead until combined. Knead
in the peanuts. Pat the dough out into a 1/2-inch thickness on a
cutting board. Useing a floured 2-1/2-inch to 3-inch diameter
crinkled round biscuit cutter, cut out rounds from the dough. Gather
the scraps together and repeat until all the dough is used and there
are 16 rounds. Place 8 of the rounds on an ungreased baking sheet.
Top each round with a piece of the chocolate and one of the remaining
circles of dough. Press the edges gently to seal. Bake for 17 to 19
minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove the baking sheet to a wire
rack and cool for 5 minutes. Using a spatula, transfer the scones to

1 tablespoon butter
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup whipping (heavy) cream
1 1/4 cup salted peanuts

together the cocoa and baking soda then add the butter. Set aside. In
a heavy 2 quart saucepan, stir together the sugar, corn syrup, and
whipping cream.  Cook, over medium heat, stirring constantly until
the sugar is dissolved.  Stir in the peanuts. Continue cooking,
stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches 300 Degrees F. or when
syrup dropped into very cold water separates into threads which are
hard and brittle. (Make sure that the bulb of the candy thermometer
is not resting on the bottom of the pan when using one.) Remove from
the heat and stir in the cocoa mixture. Immediately pour onto the
prepared cookie sheet. With tongs or wooden spoons, quickly spread
and pull into a 1/4-inch thickness. Place the cookie sheet on a wire
rack to cool completely. When the candy is cold, snap into pieces and

2 cup fresh white bread crumbs
1 cup blanched almonds; finely ground
2  eggs
2 tablespoon milk
1/3 cup almond brickle chips
1  fresh strawberries; sliced (for garnish)

Recipe by: webmaster@godiva.com Make the caramel nut ice cream:

1. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and
the salt until blended.

2. In a medium saucepan, bring the half-and-half and cream to a gentle
boil. Remove the pan from the heat.

3. In a heavy, large saucepan, using a wooden spoon, stir together the
remaining sugar and lemon juice. Over medium heat, cook the sugar mixture
for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until it liquefies and then turns
to an amber-colored caramel. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
half-and-half mixture. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring
constantly, to help dissolve any caramel that may have hardened. Bring the
caramel mixture to a gentle boil and remove the pan from the heat.

4. Gradually whisk about 1 cup of the hot caramel mixture into the beaten
egg yolks until blended. Return this mixture to the saucepan. Continue
cooking over medium low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon for 2
to 4 minutes, or until the custard has thickened slightly. It is done when
you can run your finger down the back of the custard-coated spoon and a
path remains. Do not let the custard boil.

5. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately strain the custard through
a sieve into a stainless steel bowl. Place the bowl over a larger bowl of
ice water and stir the custard for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cool. Stir in
the vanilla. Remove the bowl of custard from the bowl of ice water. Cover
the surface of the custard with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6
hours, or overnight, until very cold.

6. Scrape the chilled custard into the container of an ice cream maker and
freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions, adding the chopped
almonds for the last 2 minutes of freezing.
Transfer the ice cream to a bowl. Cover the surface of the ice

Classic Chocolate Truffles

candy

1  stephen ceideburg
1 lb bittersweet chocolate, finely chopp; ed
1 1/2 cup whipping cream
3 tablespoon to 4 tb cocoa powder
1 1/2 lb bittersweet chocolate *

* to be tempered (see directions below)

These truffles are as close as you can get to eating pure chocolate.
When you bite through the outer coating, you are treated to a creamy
rich chocolate center. They will make you feel like royalty.

Melt the chopped chocolate in the top of a double boiler over hot, not
simmering, water, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula to ensure
even melting. In a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream
to a boil. Remove both pans from the heat, remove the top pan, from
the double boiler and wipe it dry (see Editor's Note), pour the cream
into the melted chocolate, and stir together until thoroughly
blended. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover, let cool to room
temperature, and chill in the refrigerator until thick but not stiff
(2 to 3 hours).

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Fit a 12- inch
pastry bag with a #5 large, plain round tip and fill partway with the
truffle cream. Holding the pastry. bag 1 inch above the paper, pipe
out mounds about 1 inch in diameter. Cover the mounds with plastic
wrap and chill in the freezer for 2 hours or in the refrigerator for
6 hours. Dust your hands with cocoa powder and roll the mounds into
balls. These will be the truffle centers. Cover and chill the centers
for another 2 hours in the freezer.

Melt and temper the 1 1/2 pounds bittersweet chocolate. Line 2 more
baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Remove the truffle
centers from the freezer 1 sheet at a time. Place a truffle center
into the tempered chocolate, coating it completely. With a dipper or
fork remove the center from the chocolate, carefully shake off the
excess chocolate, and turn the truffle out onto the paper. Then dip a
fork into the chocolate and form lines across the tops of the
truffles by moving the fork from one side of the baking sheet to the
other, letting the chocolate drop off. Repeat with the remaining
sheet of truffle centers.

Let the truffles set at room temperature or chill them in the
refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes. When the truffles are set, place
them in paper candy cups. In a tightly covered container wrapped in
several layers of aluminum foil, the truffles will keep for 1 month
in the refrigerator or 2 months in the freezer. The truffles are best
served at room temperature.

Variations

Instead of dipping the truffle centers into tempered cho- colate,
roll them in cocoa powder, confectioners' sugar, or finely chopped
nuts as soon as they are rolled into balls.

Classic White Chocolate Truffles

Substitute 1 pound white chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate in
the centers, and use 3/4 cup whipping cream. Dip the centers and line
the tops of the truffles with tempered white chocolate, or roll the
centers in confectioners' sugar as soon as they are rolled into balls.

Classic Milk Chocolate Truffles

Substitute milk chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate in the
centers and for the coating, and 1 cup whipping cream.

Quick tempering method

Chop 1 1/2 pounds of chocolate into very small pieces and set aside
1/2 pound. Melt the remaining 1 pound in the top of a double boiler
over hot, not simmering, water, stirring frequently with a rubber
spatula to ensure even melting. The chocolate should not exceed 120
degrees F (110 degrees F for white cho- colate) or it will burn.
Remove the double boiler from the heat, then remove the top pan of
the double boiler and wipe it dry. Stir in the remaining chocolate in
three to four batches, making sure that each batch is completely
melted before adding the next. When all the chocolate has been added,
the chocolate will be tempered.

Editor's note: It's important to follow this step. Carole Bloom says
water is the enemy of chocolate and that even a few drops can cause a
pan of chocolate to "seize up" and resemble mud. If this happens, she
says you cannot salvage it. Make sure all utensils are completely dry
when working with chocolate.

Yield: 60 1-inch round truffles.

Coconut Almond Balls

chocolate, candy, microwave

4 cup (8 1/2-oz) shredded coconut (fresh; package!)
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1 pkg (11 1/2-oz) milk chocolate pieces
1/4 cup vegetable shortening
26  whole natural almonds (1-oz)

Tastes just like Almond Joy.

Line two large cookie sheets with waxed paper. Set large wire cooling
rack on paper; set aside.

Place coconut in large bowl; set aside.

Place corn syrup in a 1-cup glass measure. Microwave on high (100%) 1
minute or until syrup boils. Immediately pour over coconut. Work warm
syrup into coconut using the back of a wooden spoon until coconut is
thoroughly coated. This takes a little time, and yes, there is enough
syrup.

Using 1 level measuring tablespoon of coconut, shape into a ball by
squeezing coconut firmly in palm of one hand, then rolling between
both palms. (HINT: Measure out all of the coconut then roll into
balls.) Place 2 inches apart on wire racks. Let dry 10 minutes.
Reroll coconut balls so there are no loose ends of coconut sticking
up.

Place milk chocolate and shortening in a 4-cup glass measure or 1 1/2
quart microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes or until
mixture can be stirred smooth and is glossy; stirring once or twice.

Working quickly, spoon 1 level measuring tablespoon of the chocolate
over each coconut ball, making sure chocolate coats and letting
excess chocolate drip down onto waxed paper. While chocolate coating
is still soft, lightly press whole almond on top of each. Let stand
to set or place in refrigerator. Store in a single layer in airtight
container. Keeps best if refrigerated. Makes 26.

Dark Chocolate Mousse~ The Royal Orleans

deserts, puddings

1  chocolate mousse
12 oz top-quality semi-sweet
1  chocolate (the better
1  the chocolate, the better
1  the mousse)
1 cup whipping cream
1/4 cup hot coffee
1/4 cup hot water
3  egg yolks, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla
5  egg whites
1/3 cup sugar

For dark chocolate mousse, as was served at the Royal Orleans (and was
considered to be the best chocolate mousse anyone had ever tasted),
use the list of ingredients below and follow the same procedure as
above, except using hot coffee instead of brandy, and whisking the
vanilla into he egg yolk-chocolate mixture instead of into the whites.

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat. It's a good idea
to stand over the chocolate while it is melting and stir it until it's
completely melted, then take it off the heat immediately.

Whip the cream and set aside. Pour the hot coffee and hot water
slowly into a bowl with the egg yolks, whisking briskly as you go
until completely mixed. Add the vanilla to the egg yolks.

Whisk in the melted chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is
completely combined; this will help to cool the chocolate. Whip the
egg whites and the sugar until peaking but not dry.

Fold the egg-white meringue into the chocolate mixture carefully with
a wooden spoon.

Fold in the whipped cream. THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF THE
RECIPE. The key to a great chocolate mousse is that you can't
incorporate hot melted chocolate into whipped cream. The chocolate
mixture must be cool to the touch or the cream will break. Lightly
blend the two mixtures until uniform.

This mousse is at its best cloudlike texture right after
incorporating the whipped cream. But at Andrea's, they pipe it into
dish-shaped champagne glasses, sprinkle chocolate shavings and
powdered sugar over the top, and refrigerate. This causes the mousse
to set, which gives it a different, heavier texture. Walt MM

Death By Chocolate #4

beverages, alcohol, sauces, spreads

      ----           ==CRUST----
1/2 cup chocolate wafer crumbs
6 tablespoon sweet butter
      ----           ==FILLING----
12 oz semi-sweet chocolate
1/2 cup heavy cream
8 oz sweet butter; softened
2 tablespoon kahlua
1 pinch salt
      ----           ==SAUCE----
1/2 cup whipping cream
4 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter
1 teaspoon finely grnd expresso coffee
      ----           KAHLUA WHIPPE----
1/2 pint whipping cream
1 tablespoon kahlua (to 3t)
1 tablespoon powdered sugar (to 3t)

Crust Instructions:
Crush or grind fine chocolate wafers in food processor or put wafer in a
ziploc and crush with a rolling pin.  Melt butter and blend into crumbs.
Pat into tart or 9" pie pan.  Chill until firm (about 1 hour) before
filling or bake at 300 degrees for 15 minutes, cool,and fill.

If chilled, just before serving, rub the outside of the filled pie plate
with a warm, damp towel.  This softens the butter in the crust, making it
less likely to stick to the pie plate.  To prepare the towel, rinse it in
very hot water, then wring well.  This procedure is not necessary if the
crust is baked, since it will slide out easily by itself.

Filling Instructions:
In a large saucepan combine the chocolate, cream, butter, and Kahlua and
heat the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring until it is smooth.
Remove from heat, allow to cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Pour
into cooled tart shell and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.

Sauce Instructions:
In a saucepan, combine cream, sugar, and butter.  Cook over low
heat,stirring frequently, until mixture boils.  Boil 5 minutes, stirring
occasionally.  Remove from heat.  Stir in expresso grounds. To serve,
spoon a moderate amount of warm sauce on a rimmed plate. Top with a wedge
of tart.

Whipped Cream (Alternative) Instructions:
Whip cream until the consistency of pudding. Gradually add the powdered
sugar, beating until soft peaks form. Gradually drizzle in the Kahlua,
beating until desired consistency is obtained.

Death By Chocolate #5

appetizers, beverages, breads, nuts, breakfast
eggs, spreads

      ----LA MORT AU CHOCOLAT  OR  D----
      ----MERINGUE LAYER----
1/3 cup egg white
3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoon cocoa powder, unsweetened
      ----GENOISE LAYER ----
10 each egg; beaten
3/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup flour; + 2 t
2 tablespoon cocoa powder, unsweetened
1 tablespoon butter, melted
      ----MOUSSE----
1 lb belgian bittersweet choc.
6 each egg yolk
8 each egg white
1/2 cup sugar
      ----GANACHE----
6 oz belgian bittersweet choc.
2/3 cup whipping cream
      ----GARNISH----
1/2 cup almonds, toasted chopped
1  almonds, sliced; addl
10 each hazelnuts, whole; to 12

Note: Meringue layer and Genoise may be prepared well in advance. Just
before assembling, prepare Chocolate Mousse and Ganache.

Meringue:  Combine egg whites and sugar in the top of a double boiler.
Heat to lukewarm.  Remove from heat.  Pour into mixing bowl and beat about
15 minutes at medium speed, until stiff.  Quickly fold in the cocoa to
prevent the meringue from falling.  Grease a 10" springform pan, line with
parchment paper, and grease again.  Pipe meringue through a pastry bag
using the round tube, forming a spiral on the bottom of the springform
pan, starting from the center and working out toward the sides until the
bottom is completely covered.  Bake at 250 degrees for 2 hours.  Allow to
cool in the pan.

Genoise:  Grease a 10" x 3" round baking pan, line with baking parchment,
and grease again.  Combine beaten eggs and sugar in the top of the double
boiler.  Heat to lukewarm.  Remove from the heat.  Pour into a mixing bowl
and beat on high speed about 10 minutes, or until the batter forms a
ribbon.  Sift the flour and cocoa into the batter and fold to combine.
Fold in the butter.  Pour into the prepared pan and bake at 350 degrees 35
to 40 minutes, or until the cake springs back when lightly touched and a
toothpick comes out clean.  Cool thoroughly.  Remove from pan.

Mousse:  Melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering
water.  Remove pan from the heat and cool.  Beat in the egg yolks, one at
a time.  Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Lightly fold a
quarter of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate.  Fold in the
remaining egg whites, lightly but thoroughly.  Chill.

Ganache:  Heat chocolate and cream together in the top of the double
boiler over simmering water until the chocolate melts.  Blend well.

Assembly:  Spoon half the ganache over the meringue layer in the pan and
smooth evenly over the surface.  Cut the chocolate Genoise into two 1/4"
slices, reserving the rest of the cake for another use. Place one slice
over the ganache and meringue layer.  Cover with about half the mousse.
Top with the second layer of cake.  Spoon the remaining mousse over the
cake and chill until set, at least four to six hours.

Just before serving, spoon remaining ganache on the cake. Carefully line
the sides of the cake with chopped toasted almonds. Decorate the top with
hazelnut roses by placing the whole hazelnuts evenly around the top of the
cake, then place almond slices around each hazelnut to resemble petals.

A treasured - and often-reprinted - recipe for "La Mort au Chocolat" from
Les Anges restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif., it is a complicated one.
With four separate parts, the preparation of this cake could indeed be the

1 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
3 tablespoon instant espresso, dissolved n
1 tablespoon hot water
1  ganache:
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
6 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopp d fine
1  assembly:
3/4 cup apricot preserves, heated to ukewar; m
1  chocolate coffee beans for d corati; on

Line 2 greased jelly-roll pans, 15x10x1-inch each, with wax paper and
butter and flour the paper, shaking off excess. In a large bowl with
an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks. Add slowly 1-1/2 cups sugar,
beating, and beat the mixture until it is thick and pale and forms a
ribbon. Add the chocolate and combine the batter well.

In another large bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites until
they hold soft peaks.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar slowly, and
beat until whites hold stiff peaks. Stir a fourth of the whites into
the yolk mixture, fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly, and
pour the batter into the pans, spreading it evenly. Bake the cake
layers in the middle of a preheated 375f oven for 18-20 minutes or
until pick test. Let cake layers cool in the pans, covered with
kitchen towels on large racks. Invert the cake layers onto the racks
and remove the wax paper carefully.

Buttercream:      In a small heavy saucepan, dissolve sugar in 1/3 cup
water over moderate heat, stirring. Bring mixture to a boil, and boil
it until it registers240f on a candy thermometer.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat eggs until they are
frothy. Add sugar syrup in a thin stream, beating, and beat the
mixture until it is cool.  Beat in the butter, one Tbsp at a time.

remove from heat.  Add chocolate and stir until it is smooth. Transfer
mixture to a bowl and chill, covered, stirring occasionally, until it
is cool and thickened.  Do not let it solidify. Beat the mixture
until it just forms soft peaks, but do not overbeat.

Assembly:        Force preserves through a fine sieve into a bowl.
Transfer the cake layers to a work surface. Trim edges and halve each
layer lengthwise. On a serving plate, arrange one layer, spread with
a third of the preserves, and spread a third of the ganache over the
preserves. Top with another layer and proceed with the preserves,
ganache and cake in the same manner, ending with a cake layer on top.
Spread the sides and top of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream
an chill for 30 minutes. Spread on additional buttercream, leaving
about 1/3 cup to make rosettes. With a pastry comb or tines of a
fork, score the buttercream lengthwise. Draw the back of a knife
crosswise across the scored buttercream at intervals. Transfer the
remaining buttercream to a small pastry bag fitted with a decorative
tip. Pipe rosettes on top of the torte along the long sides and
intersperse the rosettes with chocolate coffee beans. Chill.

Remove from refrigerator about 30 minutes before serving.

Double Mocha Madness (Recipe For Caramel Rum

chocolate, deserts, ice cream

      ----KAREN PHILLIPS CBTX40A----
      ----HAZELNUT PRALINES----
1/4 cup hazelnuts
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
      ----DOUBLE MOCHA ICE CREAM----
8 oz semi-sweet chocolate; broken into 1/2 oz pcs
2 oz unsweetened chocolate; broken into 1/2 oz pc
1/4 cup brewed coffee; full strength
2 tablespoon instant espresso powder
2 cup heavy cream
1 cup half-and-half
1 cup granulated sugar
5  egg yolks

EQUIPMENT: 2 baking sheets with sides, 2 large 100%-cotton towels,
food processor with metal blade, 2 2 1/2-qt saucepans, metal spoon, 2
2-quart plastic containers with lids, double boiler, electric mixer
fitted with a paddle, rubber spatula, 2 stainless steel bowls (1
large), instant-read test thermometer, ice-cream freezer

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast and skin the hazelnuts, then
allow the nuts to cool to room temperature. In the bowl of a food
processor fitted with a metal blade, chop the hazelnuts into pieces
1/8 inch in size. Spread the chopped hazelnuts onto a baking sheet
with sides.

Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt
saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist
sand). Caramelize the sugar for 4 1/2 to 5 minutes over medium-high
heat, stirring constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the
sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it
caramelizes). Pour the caramelized sugar over the chopped hazelnuts.
Stir the mixture with a spoon, then spread it into an uneven mass,
about 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Allow the pralines to cool to room
temperature. Break the pralines into uneven pieces, then place in the
bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Chop the pralines
into 1/8-inch pieces. Transfer the chopped pralines to a plastic
container with a lid. Freeze until needed. Makes 1 1/2 quarts

Double Mocha Madness * Part 2 Of 2

chocolate, deserts, ice cream

      ----DIRECTIONS CONTINUE----

To prepare the ice cream, heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a
double boiler over medium-high heat. Place the semi-sweet and
unsweetened chocolates, coffee, and instant espresso powder in the
top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with film wrap.
Heat for 6 to 8 >>> minutes, then remove from the heat and stir until
smooth. Set aside until needed. Heat the heavy cream, half-and-half,
and 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan over medium-high
heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring the cream to a boil. While
the cream is heating, place the egg yolks and the remaining 1/2 cup
sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the
eggs on high for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the
bowl. Contine to beat on high until slightly thickened and
lemon-colored, about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. (At this point, the cream
should be boiling. If not, adjust the mixer to low and continue to
mix until the cream ils. If this is not done, the egg yolks will
develop undesirable lumps. Pour the boiling cream into the beaten egg
yolks and whisk to combine. Return to the saucepan and heat over
medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the cream reaches a
temperature of 185 degrees, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and
transfer to a stainless steel bowl. Add the melted chocolate mixture
and whisk to combine. Cool the ixture in an ice-water bath to a
temperature for 40 o 45 degrees, abou t 20 minutes Freeze in an
ice-cream freezer following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer
the semi-frozen ice cream to a plastic container. Using a rubbe
spatula, fold in the frozen, chopped pralines Securely cover the
container, then place in the freezer for several hours before
serving. Serve within 3 days. Yields 1

Easter Bunnies On A Stick

chocolate, deserts, candy, holiday

1 lb chocolate coating
1 lb white coating or any color
1  taffy molds
1  sticks
1  taffy covers

You can also buy your molds and sticks, and sleeves of plastic to put
over the taffy at a candy supply store. Melt the coatings. I use a
electric fry pan with water on low and use small stainless steel or
glass bowls to melt different color coatings and of course the
chocolate. Just fill the molds, put in stick and roll it to coat it
and set it in the coating. I place in the frezzer for a minute or two
to make them nice and shiny.

Easter Coated Pretzils

chocolate, candy, holiday

2 lb white or colored coating or chocola; te
1 pkg small prestzils

I like to use up the left over colors from making Easter candy and
coat pretzil for the very little ones. They love the different
colored pretzils, And especially the chocolate ones,<G> so do the
grown ups. Again just melt your coatings,chocolate or white, or color
the white. Melt in small bowls in pan of water, just warm never hot.
Dip the pretzils in and lift with a fork, shaking off excest coating.
and lay on wax paper cooky sheet, that will fit  in your freezer. You
really don't have to use the freezer. they will set up setting out,
but look bvetter and set up faster in Frig or freezer. Good Luck and
Enjoy from Joni in S.Jersey. Jenilee and Scott loove to coat animal

Ebony And Ivory Chocolate Truffles

beverages

7 1/2 oz white chocolate, chopped into 1/4 i; nch pieces
8 oz semi-sweet chocolate, chopped into; 1/4 inch pieces
3/4 cup heavy cream
5 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa

Equipment:
Cutting board
Cooks knife
Measuring cup
Measuring spoons
2 stainless steel bowls
1.1/2 quart saucepan
2 whisks
Baking sheet
Parchment paper

Place the white and dark chocolates into separate stainless steel
bowls. Heat the cream in a 1.1/2 quart saucepan over medium heat.
Bring to a boil. Pour 1/4 cup boiling cream over the white
chocolate and the remaining 1/2 cup over the dark chocolate and
allow to stand for 4 to 5 minutes. Stir each with a separate
whisk until smooth, and allow to cool for 1 hour at room
temperature. Refrigerate the two ganaches for 15 minutes,
stirring every 5 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Portion 36 heaping
teaspoons of dark chocolate into separate mounds onto the
parchment paper. Top each teaspoon of dark chocolate with a level
teaspoon of white chocolate.
To fashion the truffles, roll each portion of chocolate in your
palms in a gentle circular motion using just enough pressure to
from smooth rounds.

Roll the rounds of chocolate in cocoa until completely covered.

Note: If the heat of the cream is not sufficient to thoroughly
melt the chocolate, or if the chocolate does not completely
dissolve while you are stirring, then place the bowl of chocolate
over very hot water (not simmering or boiling) and continue to
stir to a smooth texture.

Frequently wipe your hands clean during the process of rolling
the truffles. Some candy makers suggest dusting the palms of your
hands with cocoa powder.
It is easier to completely cover the truffles with cocoa if they
are rolled around in a substantial amount. The remaining 4 to
4.1/2 Tablespoons of cocoa may be sifted and used for other uses.

In place of cocoa you may enrobe the truffles with several other
coatings: Deep Dark Chocolate Fudge Cookie Crumbs, finely chopped
nuts (macadamia nuts are terrific), shredded coconut or the
Ultimate Chocolate Ganache. Another ploy for candy makers is to
place a pistachio or hazelnut in the center of the chocolate-
truffle mixture and roll the chocolate around the nut.
The truffles may be refrigerated for several days before serving.
Do, however, bring the truffles to room temperature before
offering them to your guests (this will take 15-20 minutes)

If the truffles absorb the cocoa during refrigeration, simply
roll them in more cocoa before serving.

Eletta's Frozen Chocolate Mousse With Pistach

italian, ice cream

      ----MOUSSE----
5 oz bittersweet chocolate
1 1/2 oz unsweetened chocolate
4 tablespoon butter
5 tablespoon dry marsala
2  egg yolks
4  egg whites, room temp
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup whipping cream, whipped and chilled
1/2 cup chopped pistachios
      ----MOCHA MARSALA SAUCE----
1 1/2 tablespoon instant espresso granules
1/2 cup boiling water
1/3 cup dry marsala
4 oz bittersweet chocolate
5 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon butter

Mousse and sauce can be done a day in advance. To prepare mousse,
melt bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate and set aside to cool to
room temperature. Combine butter and marsala in a small bowl and set
over boiling water. Heat until marsala is bubbling and butter melted.
Remove bowl from pan and let cool a few moments, then whisk in yolks.
Place again over boiling water and stir until yolks begin to thicken.
Cool. Add cream of tartar to whites and beat to soft peaks and
gradually beat in sugar until stiff and glossy. Gently fold together
whites, cooled chocolate, egg mixture, cream and nuts, taking care to
keep mixture light. Turn into a freezer container and freeze at least
4 hours. Let stand a couple of hours in refrigerator to soften before
serving.

To make the sauce, combine the coffee with boiling water and stir
until dissolved. Turn into a small bowl, adding the marsala,
chocolate and sugar. Set over a pan of hot water and stir until
chocolate is melted. Stir in butter until smooth. Reheat before
serving.

To serve, use a small ice cream scoop to spoon out about 4 balls of
mousse into each of 8 wine glasses. Drizzle with hot sauce and serve.

Flo's White Chocolate Raspberry Brownie Petit

chocolate, brownies

      Raspberry Brownies-----
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 oz unsalted butter -- cut into
1  pieces
3 oz unsweetened chocolate --
1  finely chopped
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar -- packed
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
2 large eggs -- at room temperature
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup fresh raspberries -- at room
1  temperature
1  white chocolate raspberry
1  topping---
2 oz unsalted butter -- cut into
1  pieces
6 oz white chocolate -- chopped
1  fine
1/2 cup fresh red raspberries -- at
1  room temperature

1. Brownie:  Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and
preheat to 325 F.  Line an 8-inch square baking pan with a double
thickness of aluminum foil so that the foil extends 2 inches beyond
two of the opposite ends of the pan.  Fold the overhang down to form
"handles. " Butter the bottom of the foil-lined pan. Sift flour,
baking soda, and salt through a wire strainer onto a sheet of wax
paper.

2. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Off heat, add
chocolate and let stand 1 minute; whisk until smooth. Pour into a
large bowl, and let stand 5 minutes, until tepid. Whisk in sugars and
corn syrup. Whisk in eggs, then vanilla.  Using a wooden spoon, stir
in flour mixture, just until blended.  Using a rubber spatula,
carefully fold in raspberries.

3. Spread batter evenly into prepared pan and bake 25 to 30 minutes,
until a toothpick inserted 1 inch from the edge of the brownie comes
out with a moist crumb. Cool on a wire cake rack for 10 minutes.
Invert onto the wire cake rack, carefully peel off aluminum foil, and
cool completely.

4. White Chocolate Raspberry Topping:  In the top part of a double
boiler, over hot, not simmering, water, melt butter. (Water should be
no warmer than 125 F. ) Add white chocolate and melt, stirring often
until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl, and let stand 10 minutes,
until tepid and slightly thickened.  Using a metal cake spatula,
spread half of the topping onto the top of the brownie. Freeze
brownie for 5 minutes, just until topping is partially set. Using a
sharp knife, mark topping of brownie into 16 squares.  Using a rubber
spatula, carefully fold remaining 1/2 cup raspberries into remaining
topping.  Divide white chocolate-coated raspberries evenly among
brownies, arranging them attractively on top of each square. Loosely
cover brownies with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to
set topping completely. Using a sharp knife, cut through markings
into 16 squares. Transfer brownies to a serving plate and cover
tightly with plastic wrap.  Brownies can be made up to 1 day ahead,
refrigerated, and covered with plastic wrap. Bring to room
temperature before serving

1/2 lb chocolate-coating wafers com

Recipe by: 365 Great Chocolate Desserts - ISBN 0-06-016537-5
foil pie pans. Foil pans must be used for easy removal of baked
florentines in 1 piece. 2. In a medium-large heavy saucepan, combine
butter, sugar, honey, and cream. Heat to boiling over medium heat,
stirring frequently. Cook 1 1/2 mins, stirring constantly. Remove
from heat. Stir in almonds. 3. Divide mixture evenly among greased
pie pans. Using back of wooden spoon, pat evenly into bottom of pans.
Bake pans 3 at a time, on a single oven rack, 10 to 14 mins, or until
a rich golden brown. Rotate pans during baking, if necessary, to
avoid overbrowning. Let cool completely in pans. Refrigerate 10 to 15
mins for ease in unmolding. 4. With fingers, carefully press in pan
bottoms from underneath and pop florentines out in 1 piece.
Refrigerate florentines, stacked between layers of wax paper until
thoroughly chilled, about 3 hours. 5. Spread melted chocolate coating
over bottoms of chilled florentines. Let stand until chocolate is
set. Wrap each florentine separately in plastic wrap. Store in
refrigerator.

NOTE: Use melted chocolate-coating wafers, which are available at cake
decorating and candy supply stores, to spread on the bottoms of
florentines for best results. This type of chocolate will stay shiny
and give your florentines a professional look. These make fantastic
holiday gifts.

Hawaiian Fresh Fruits Chocolate Lilikoi Sabay

fruits, deserts, hawaiian

      ----NORMA WRENN----
1  for sabayon:
2 oz hawaiian vintage chocolate melted
1/4 cup sugar
6  egg yolks
1/4 cup lilikoi (passion fruit)
1/4 cup water
1  hawaiian fresh fruits:
2  papaya
2  mangoes; peeled; seeded
12  strawberries; cleaned with stems remove
4  sprigs fresh mint leaves

To prepare the fruits:  Peel the papaya, prepare into melon balls and
set aside.  Take one half of mango and finely sliced lengthwise. Then
take one twelve-inch plate and start making the design with the mango
into a triangle leaving the center empty, then add the sliced
strawberries inside theh triangle in one layer. Add the melon balls
of papaya in the center. Repeat this for the rest of the plates.

To prepare the sabayon:

Melt the Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate in a medium size bowl over a
double boiler. When melted turn off the heat. In a separate bowl,
cream the egg yolks and sugar well but do not beat them. Place the
bowl in hot water bath, taking great care that the bottom of the bowl
containing the egg and sugar mixture does not tough the hot bottom of
the pan beneath. Pour the lilikoi and wate into the bowl of egg yolks
and sugar, stirring continuously.  The hot water bath should not come
to a boil but be kept just below simmering point. Now beat the
mixture energetically with the balloon whish until it froths and has
doubled in volume and until it is mixted consistenly like a ribbon.
Pour chocolate into sabayon and mix together.  Serve with Hawaiian
fruits. Garnish with sprig of mint.

Hazelnut-Chocolate Toffee

deserts, candy, holiday

1 1/4 cup (2-1/2 sticks) unsalted butt
1 1/4 cup packed light-brown sugar
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon honey
1 cup toasted and skinned hazelnut choppe; d
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (about 6; ounces)

Butter a small baking sheet. Melt the butter over low heat in a large
heavy saucepan. Add the sugar, water, and honey and stir constantly
until melted, using a wooden spoon. Increase the heat to moderately
high and continue cooking for 15 minutes, or till the mixture reaches
290 degrees (hard-ball stage) on a candy thermometer, stirring often
with a wooden spatula, scraping the bottom of the pan to make sure
the mixture is not sticking. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in
the chopped nuts and vanilla extract. Pour the toffee evenly onto the
prepared baking sheet. Cool about 5 minutes, until the surface is
barely set. Sprinkle the top of the toffee with the chocolate chips.
Let stand about 10 minutes, until the toffee is completely set and
the chocolate is melted. Spread the chocolate evenly in a thin layer
over the toffee. Cool completely until the chocolate is firm. Break
the toffee into rough pieces and store in an airtight container for
up to 5 days.  Makes about 1 pound. Source: "An Edible Christmas"

Heavenly Chocolate--Gogul Mogul

deserts

2  eggs (separated)
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/3 teaspoon salt
2  or 3 drops vanilla
1/3 teaspoon cream of tartar
1  cocoa according to pkg instructions

Prepare cocoa according to package instructions.  Have eggs at room
temperature.  Add salt and cream of tartar to egg whites and beat
until mixture forms rounding peaks. Beat in 1/2 cup sugar, a
tablespoon at a time and continue beating until the sugar is
dissolved and the mixture forms glossy pointed peaks (takes about 10
minutes). Add the vanilla and continue beating 2 to 3 minutes longer.

Beat the egg yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, a tablespoon at a
time, until its heavy and thick enough to float on top of the cocoa.
(This will also require about 10 minutes of beating time.) Place the
yolk mixture on top of the cocoa and top with the egg white mixture.
You will need to use a spoon first before you can drink this. On a
cold wintry night it is suggest you might wish to add some cognac to
the cocoa.

I might also suggest dusting the top of the egg white with nutmeg or
cinnamon.  Elegant!

Homemade Chocolates (Laura Secord Type)

chocolate, candy

3 lb icing sugar
1 can eagle brand sweetened
1 single evaporated milk
1 single butter or margarine
1 single parafin wax (parawax)
1 single semi-sweet baking chocolate
1 single food coloring
1 single artifical food flavors

The above ingredients are approximate quantities only!!! For every
cup of icing sugar you use, mix in approximately 1 teaspoon of
softened butter or margarine. Then slowly mix in enough of the
evaporated milk to make the mixture of a consistency such that you
can form a ball with it. (Mixing with the hands is the easiest way).
Next seperate the mixture into as many parts (3 or 4) as you want
different flavored chocolates. Then slowly knead in the desired
flavoring and food color you want in each different part. Now mold
the resultant mixture into the desired shapes and sizes you want your
chocolates to be. Now melt in a double boiler (or microwave) two
parts semi-sweet chocolate to one part parawax. Remove from heat.
Immediately, using a tooth pick, pick up each shape created above and
dip it into the chocolate mixture to coat them. Then put them on a
piece of wax paper until the chocolate coating is set. As the
chocolate mixture cools and thickens, reheat it and continue. If you
run out of chocolate mixture, simply add more chocolate and parawax
in the proportions listed above.

Note: Suggested flavors and colors:
- Maple flavor with no coloring
- Mint flavor with green coloring
- Lemon flavor with yellow coloring
- Orange flavor with orange coloring
- Almond Flavoring with red coloring (small amount to create
pink)

Variations:
- With the Maple flavoring, you can bury a piece of pecan or walnut
inside the candy before dipping it into the chocolate
- With the almond flavoring, bury a marachino cherry inside the
candy
before dipping it in the chocolate. Add a drop of cherry juice
with it
to prevent the cherry being too dry.
- Use the same recipe to make Easter eggs, bunnies etc. Ex. For
Easter
eggs, make a center part of one color and flavor and wrap it in
another color and flavor before dipping.

Note: Parawax must be used with the chocolate to create a consistency
that
will stick to your candy and not your fingers when set. It is
not
harmful and is used commercially.

Hot Chocolate - Larousse Gastronomique 1961

beverages, chocolate, larousse

1 oz (generous) good sweet chocolate; broken to pieces
1  small quantity of milk; or water
2 tablespoon to 3 tbsp water or milk; boiling
1 cup milk or water; boiling

Original title: Chocolat.

A generous ounce (40 grams) of good sweet chocolate is needed for a
breakfast cup.  Put the chocolate broken up into pieces with a small
quantity of water or hot milk in a casserole on a gentle heat. Cover
the pan, let the chocolate soften, remove from the fire and whip into
a smooth paste with a whip or wooden spoon; add first of all two or
three tablespoons of boiling liquid (water or milk) to dilute the
paste, then the rest of the liquid, still boiling, continuing to stir
all the time. To retain the full aroma of the chocolate (the same
applies to cocoa) it must never be allowed to boil.

Gabi's notes: (1) Excellent with Mexican chocolate, such as Ibarra.
(2) I got good results using cold milk, added gradually to the hot
mixture until fully incorporated, then heated to warm (don't allow it
to boil). I use a wooden hand whisk.

How To Make Chocolate Covered Cherries

candy

1  liquid type/candy mold
1  marachino cherries in juice
1  dry candy fondant
1  compound coating chocolate

~Fill a sqeeze bottle with melted <coating> chocolate. ~Sqeeze out
choc. into ea. mold cavity. -Tilt the mold to be sure ea cavity is
coated clear to the tops all around. -Invert mold over wax paper &
prop with <flexible plastic c > <so mold isn't touching wax paper.>
<<<OR>>> -Invert over foil sheet pan w/cake rack in it. -Let the
excess choc. drip out. -When choc. starts to set up <not shiny & is
"rubbery">, use a small <Wilton> <bent> spatula to scrape off
drippings level at tops of ea cavity. READY TO ADD SYRUP: -Have mixed
& in separate sqeeze bottle: 1 part Marachino cherry juice 10 parts
Dry Candy Fondant This should be the consistancy of Karo syrup. Don't
worry you can't ruin this! After you have mixed the ingredients
together in a bowl, pour into the squeeze bottle. DRY MARACHINO
CHERRIES ON PAPER TOWELS & place one in each cavity. Add syrup to
1/4" from the top. ~Using the squeeze bottle of chocolate <work in
spiral from outside/into center, add chocolate on the top to
carefully seal. ~Chill <only> until chocolate separates from the mold
<about 10 minutes.> More time may crack the choc. shells. <<Chill in
freezer section>> -Invert mold to dump out finished cherries
CAREFULLY! They may crack if they hit the table hard & you have to
eat all your mistakes <VBG>. -I wrap EVERY one in the little foil
candy wraps. If you don't wrap, "leakers" develope. That costs too &
is messy. I use the cherries in the pretty foil to add color to my
candy boxes.

Remelt "drippings" of chocolate. I use 5 molds at a time. More & the
chocolate may set up too quick for you. I think I make about 100 an
hour, maybe more, this way.

<<<NO parafin <candle wax poo>>> USE COATING CHOCOLATE! These
completely liquify in 1-2 days easy, if not sooner still. Keep
covered tightly <wrap box also in plastic <Saran>> & store in cool
place. Keeps about 3-4 weeks. The cherries don't spoil. "Bloom"
occurs when chocolate is not tightly sealed. Dolores

Israeli Chocolate-Coated Orange Peels

fruits, candy, jewish

3  oranges
2 cup sugar - plus extra for rolling
2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
5 oz bittersweet chocolate - finely chop; ped - not unsweetened
2 teaspoon vegetable oil

"I first tasted these peels in Israel, where they are made from the
local Jaffa oranges.  Often when you drop in at someone's home, the
hostess will set them out for nibbles."

Line a baking sheet with wax paper. Set aside.

Scrub oranges well, and cut in half.  Scoop out the flesh and reserve
for another use.  Place the shells in a medium-sized bowl and cover
with cold water, keeping them under water with a small plate or lid.
Let soak for about 4 hours or overnight, replacing the water once.

Cut each shell in half; place in a large heavy saucepan. Add water to
cover and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Boil for 15 minutes.
Drain and repeat the process.  When oranges are cool enough to
handle, cut into strips about 1/4 by 2".  Return the strips to the
saucepan; add sugar and 1 cup water. Bring to a simmer over low heat.
Cook gently, stirring occasionally, until liquid is almost gone,
about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (Watch closely toward the end of cooking.)
Add the lemon juice; stir to coat the strips. Drain the strips in a
sieve. When they are cool enough to handle, spread on the prepared
baking sheet.

Put all but 1/4 c. of the chocolate and the oil in the top of a double
boiler set over barely simmering water. Stir just until melted, remove
double boiler from heat, and add the remaining chocolate, stirring
until melted.  Roll each orange strip in sugar, then dip half of each
peel into the chocolate and return to the baking sheet. Place in the
freezer for a minute or two to let the chocolate set. Remove from the
freezer and let them sit for several hours until they are firm.
(Store in an airtight container for up to 3 months.)

Yield: About 80 candies.

7 oz instant chocolate pudding
1 1/2 cup milk
7 oz instant vanilla pudding
1 1/2 cup milk
3/4 cup strawberries, fresh, sliced
1  candy bar, chocolate

Servings: 20

Mix flour, butter and pecans together until finely crumbled. Press

Let cool.

Beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Fold in half of the Cool
Whip. Spread on top of the crust.

Mix 7 ounces (two packages) of instant chocolate pudding mix with 1
1/2 cups milk. Spread on top of cream cheese mixture. Mix 7 ounces
(two packages) of instant vanilla pudding mix with 1 1/2 cups milk.
Fold 3/4 basket of sliced fresh strawberries into vanilla pudding.
Spread on top of chocolate mixture. Cover the top with the remaining
Cool Whip.

Shave a chocolate candy bar with a potato peeler and add shavings to
the top of the finished cake. Refrigerate for two hours before
serving.

The dessert is outrageously rich, so plan to serve small portions. Do
not use frozen strawberries or sugar-free pudding mixes. Sliced
bananas may be substituted for the berries.

chocolate, frostings

8 oz cream cheese -- softened
4 oz butter -- softened
1 cup cocoa powder
4 cup powdered sugar
2  to 3 tbsp.
1  cream -- or milk

Cream the cheese and butter in your mixer. Sift or stir 1 cup of the
sugar with the cocoa powder and mix into the cheese and butter. Add
some cream if the stuff gets too dry. Continue adding sugar, and
cream as needed, to a spreadable consistency. Beat well to get all
the lumps out.

The exact measurements for the dry stuff is unimportant. Sometimes
(OK, all the time!-), for a more bittersweet flavor, I will add more
cocoa powder to taste

Kit's Chocolate Mousse

chocolate, deserts

18 oz semisweet chocolate
2 cup heavy cream; well chilled
6 each egg
2 tablespoon confectioner's sugar
2 tablespoon creme de cacao
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. Let it cool
until only warm. 2.
While the chocolate cools, whip the cream until it
forms medium-stiff peaks. Do not overbeat or the
mousse will lose some of its smooth, light texture. 3.
Separate 4 of the eggs and set the whites aside.
Combine yolks with the 2 remaining whole eggs in the
bowl of an electric mixer. Beat until eggs are thick
and lemon colored, around 5 minutes. While the yolks
are beating, place the 4 egg whites in a clean copper
or stainless steel bowl and whisk, preferably by hand,
until the whites start to stiffen. Sprinkle on the
confectioners' sugar and beat until you have firm
peaks. 4.  Working quickly, add the cooled melted
chocolate and a scoop of the whipped cream to the egg
yolks. Stir until smooth, then add the remaining
cream. When it is fully incorporated, add the liqueur
and vanilla, then fold in the whites until just
blended. 5.  This mousse can be poured into small
individual serving dishes or into 1 larger dessert
dish. Chill at least 4 hours before serving. (Chilling
it overnight intensifies the flavor.) The mousse may
be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Remove from the freezer
and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight before
serving. VARIATION: Make a Brownie Cookie Crust from
the Brownie Cookies recipe, then fill it with the
mousse. Chill for 4 hours, then pipe whipped cream on
top.

M&M/Mars Snickers Bar

chocolate, candy, top secret

1/4 cup light corn syrup
2 tablespoon butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 cup creamy peanut butter dash salt
3 cup powdered sugar
35  unwrapped kraft caramels
1 cup dry-roasted unsalted peanuts
12 oz milk-chocolate chips

With the mixer on high speed, combine the corn syrup, butter, vanilla,
peanut butter, and salt until creamy. Slowly add the powdered sugar.
When the mixture has the consistency of dough, remove it from the
bowl with your hands and press it into a lightly greased 9x9" pan.
Set in the refrigerator.

Melt the caramels in a small pan over low heat.  When the caramel is
soft, mix in the peanuts.  Pour the mixture over the refrigerated
nougat in the pan.  Let this cool in the refrigerator.

When the refrigerator mixture is firm, melt the chocolate over low
heat in a double boiler or in a microwave oven set on high for 2
minutes. Stir halfway through cooking time.

When the mixture in the pan has hardened, cut into 2x1" sections.

Set each chunk onto a fork and dip into the melted chocolate. Tap the
fork against the side of the bowl or pan to knock off any excess
chocolate. Then place the chunks on waxed paper to cool at room
temperature (less than 70 degrees.)  This could take several hours,
but the bars will set best this way.  You can speed up the process by
placing the bars in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

minutes on high, rotating after 3 minutes. Allow to cool.

Mint White Chocolate Mousse

eggs

4 oz chocolate, white
3 tablespoon creme de menthe, green
1 cup cream, heavy
2  egg whites (at room temperature)

Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler.  When melted, stir in the
creme de menthe. Let it cool a bit and stir in about 2 1/2 T of cream. Let
cool.

Beat the egg whites until stiff, but not dry.  Fold the
chocolate-creme-cream mixture into the beaten egg whites. THE MORE
CAREFULLY YOU FOLD, THE LIGHTER WILL BE THE MOUSSE.

Whip the remaining cream, until soft peaks form.  Fold the egg
whites-chocolate mixture into the whipped cream.  AGAIN, THE MORE AIR YOU
PRESERVE, THE LIGHTER THE MOUSSE.  Spoon carefully into small bowls or cups
and chill for about two hours.

NOTES:

*  Sinful and light mint chocolate mousse -- This concoction is a variation
of another white chocolate mousse, which is a variation of a dark rum
chocolate mousse. It was invented for a friend's birthday, which happens to
be on St. Patrick's Day. We were sitting around the day before, planning
the celebration, and I offered to bring some white mousse. Someone
suggested it should be green, in honor of the occasion. I came up with the
perfect way to make green chocolate mousse....

: Difficulty:  moderate, depending on folding and whisking skills.

Much Too Rich Chocolate Sorbet

chocolate, deserts

1/2 cup sugar
1 1/4 cup droste cocoa
1/3 cup sherry (add more sugar if you only
1  have dry sherry in the house
1  :-), but it is best to use a
1  cream sherry)
2 cup water

Mix sugar and cocoa together in bowl.  Add water and whisk until
smooth. Add sherry and then taste to check if sweetness is to your
liking. Chill mixture a bit and then put in ice cream maker and
follow the directions that came with the device.  This concoction
will take longer than usual to freeze (perhaps as much 2 hours or
more). I like my chocolate bittersweet, so you may want to use more
sugar than I have. Also, depending on the size of your ice cream
maker, you may want to double the recipe.

Makes 3 cups, 6 servings.

Passover Chocolate Nut Torte

appetizers, nuts, eggs, spreads

      ----TORTE----
6 oz butter (or margarine)
3/4 cup sugar
7  eggs, separated
4 oz chocolate (bittersweet), melted and; cooled
1 cup almonds (unblanched), finely ground
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup almonds (unblanched), chopped
      ----ICING----
4  eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon potato starch
4 oz chocolate (bittersweet), melted
4 oz margarine, softened
1/2 cup almonds, finely ground

TO MAKE TORTE:  Cream the butter and gradually beat in the sugar until the
mixture is light and creamy.  Beat in the yolks, one at a time. Blend in
the chocolate, and gently fold in the ground almonds mixed with the baking
powder. Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry, then fold into the
mixture.

Pour into a well-greased 10-inch springform pan.  Bake about 30 minutes in
an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. degrees. Allow to cool, then frost
thickly with the icing and sprinkle with the chopped nuts.

TO MAKE ICING:  Mix together the eggs, sugar and potato starch in the top
of a double boiler. Heat over boiling water, stirring, until mixture
thickens.
Do not boil the mixture, and beware of "scrambled eggs!" Cool, then stir
in the chocolate.

Gradually beat in the butter, one tablespoon at a time.  Fold in the nuts
until the mixture is thick enough to spread.

NOTES:

*  Rich chocolate dessert for Passover.  This is the only Passover dessert
I've ever tasted that is good enough to be making during the rest of the
year as well (when you can use corn starch instead of the potato starch).

*  If you don't have a springform pan for Passover, use an aluminum
disposable cake pan and just strip off the sides when the cake has cooled.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking, 5 minutes frosting.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Passover Chocolate Roll

chocolate, passover

      ----C----
6  egg whites-
1  keep at room temperature
1  for at least 1 hour
6  egg yolks
3/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa
2 teaspoon vanilla ***
1  dash salt
      ----F----
1 1/2 cup heavy cream, chilled
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar*****
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
2 teaspoon instant coffee
1 teaspoon vanilla***

Grease the bottom of a 15 1/2x10 1/2x1" jelly-roll pan; line with
waxed paper, grease lightly.   Preheat oven to 375 In a large bowl of
an electric mixer beat egg whites at high speed until soft peaks form
when beaters are slowly raised. Add 1/4 cup sugar, 2 T at a time,
beating until stiff peaks form when beater is slowly raised. With
same beaters beat yolks at high speed, adding the remaining 1/2 cup
of sugar 2 T at a time, until mixture is very thick-about 4 minutes.
At low speed beat in cocoa, vanilla and salt just until >> smooth.
With wire whisk or rubber scraper using and under and over motion,
gently fold the cocoa mixture into the beaten egg whites, just until
they are blended(no egg white should show). Spread evenly in the pan,

Bake 15 minutes, just until the surface springs back when gently
pressed with fingertip. Sift confectioner's sugar in a 15x10"
rectangle, on a clean linen towel. Turn cake out onto sugar, lift off
pan, peel paper off of cake. Roll up cake jelly-roll fashion, towel
and all, starting at the short end.

Cool completely on rack, seam side down- at least 30 minutes. To make
the filling: Combine filling ingredients in medium bowl. Beat using
an electric mixer until thick and then refrigerate. Unroll cake,
spread with fillin to 1" from the edge, reroll/ Refrigerate 1 hour
before serving. To serve sprinkle with confectioner's sugar. You may
make this cake a week ahead, then freeze it wrapped in foil. Let
stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving.

*** Pure vanilla has alcohol and therefore is not Kosher for Passover.
Either leave it out or find vanilla without the alcohol. *****
Confectioner's sugar has cornstarch and so is not Kosher for Passover,
someone posted a recipe for making confectioner's sugar by using
potato starch instead of cornstarch. I did not get the exact
directions, but I think if you backdate you will find it in one of
the dessert recipes.

Peanut Butter Candy

chocolate, candy

      ----JONI CLOUD SSMW41A----
1 lb 10x sugar
2 cup peanut butter
1/2 lb butter; softened
2 lb milk chocolate coating

Mix all ingred's until smooth and soft, If sticky add more powdered
sugar. Make into small logs, egg shape. Melt chocolate coating. I use
electric fry pan with water on low, and I use a stainless steel bowl
to melt choc-coating. It gives me more room for dipping eggs. You can
also just put them in Reese's type molds, and papers. But we shape
them in Egg shape for Easter. Put on Wax paper lined cookie sheet and
put in freezer for a few minutes, makes them shiny and nice. PS. I
use the left over chocolate to make solid chocolate bunny-you can buy
all kinds of molds that are in expensive.

Or for my Jim add nuts and raisens, and put them in papers. They are
just like a chunky bar. Or just save it in a jar for next time. the
kids always like chocolate covered small pretzils. Use your
imagination. <G> Good Luck and Enjoy By Joni in S.Jersey

Peanut Butter Chocolate Ice Cream Decadence

chocolate, bananas, ice cream

2 pint chocolate or chocolate fudge ice cr; eam
1 1/2 pint vanilla ice cream
18  chocolate sandwich cookies (such as; oreos)
3 pkg (1.6 ounce each) peanut butter cups
1 medium banana
1/4  container of a 7.25 bottle fudge ic; e cream hard shell

(such as "Magic Shell") optional: 1/4 cup of your favorite chopped
nuts (peanuts, pistachios, walnuts, etc.)

Needed: 9"x5" loaf pan. Take the ice cream from the containers and
place in two large bowls. Let stand at room temperature to soften
slightly, stirring occasionally.

While ice cream is softening, place chocolate sandwich cookies in a
closable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin or meat tenderizer
until coarse.  Coarsely chop peanut butter cups with a knife or
scissors. Slice the banana.

Spoon half of the crushed cookies into the bottom of the loaf pan,
then top with 1/4 of the softened chocolate ice cream. Stir the
peanut butter cups into the softened vanilla ice cream, then spoon
the vanilla mixture over the chocolate layer, pressing down with the
back of the spoon to remove any air pockets. Sprinkle with the
remaining crushed chocolate cookies.

Stir the sliced banana into the remaining softened chocolate ice
cream, then spoon mixture over the cookie layer. Smooth ice cream
with the back of a spoon. If desired, sprinkle with chopped nuts.
Cover ice cream loaf with plastic wrap and freeze until firm,
approximately 4 hours.

Immerse loaf pan (careful not to immerse ice cream!) in warm water,
then invert pan onto oval platter to remove ice cream. Drizzle with
ice cream "hard shell". Let stand for about 15 minutes at room
temperature before serving.  Slice with knife warmed in hot water to
serve.

Mix first 6 ingrediants together by hand or with blender until
blended. Mix in Peanut Butter.Line Jelly Roll pan with wax paper(I
used foil and it worked fine) Roll teaspoons of filling into 3/4 inch
balls(I used my hands to do this--it wasn't sticky at all... more
creamy. And make the balls on the small side...they seem to taste
better that way). Place on lined pan...refrigerate for at least 2
hours.

Melt chips and shortening together on stove (I use the microwave for 2
minutes on high).  Use a toothpick to dip into melted mixture). I dump
about 10 balls into chocolate, roll around with a spoon and lift them
out with the toothpick-- Before chocolate sets, decorate with colored
sugar, non-pareils etc.  Refrigerate 10-15 minutes to set chocolate.

Peanut Butter Cup Tarts

chocolate

36  reese's peanut butter cups
1 lb refrigerated cookie dough

* - (Either fudge, sugar, or peanut butter dough)

Refrigerate candies so paper will peel off easily. Unwrap each. Follow
slicing instructions on cookie wrapper and quarter each slice. Place
each piece in a greased miniature muffin cup. Place in preheated 350ø
oven for 8-10 minutes or just until cookie puffs and is barely done.
Remove from oven and immediately push a candy cup into each cookie
filled muffin cup. The cookie will deflate and form a tart shell
around the peanut butter cup. The heat from the cookie will melt the
chocolate toppings. Let the pan cool; then refrigerate until shine
leaves the chocolate. Remove from the refrigerator and gently lift
each tart from the cup with the tip of a knife. Makes 36 cookies.

1/8 teaspoon salt

Beat eggs well. Blend in the milk, peanut butter, sugar and salt and
pour into freezer tray.  Freeze until almost hard then pour into a
bowl and beat until smooth. Return to freezer tray or molds and
freeze until firm. Makes 4 to 6 servings *Try this with a hot fudge
sauce and topped with peanuts. Chocolate bon bon Ice cream or other
favorite flavor hard chocolate topping: Make sure the ice cream is
hard frozen. Melt 12 oz of semi-sweet chocolate pieces and 1/2 cup
margarine in the top part of a double boiler. Remove from heat but
keep warm over hot water. Use a fork to dip ice cream balls into the
chocolate, working as fast as possible. When you've dipped about 10 -
12 pieces, place then in the freezer and continue the dipping. After
the chocolate is firm, you can wrap with foil or plastic wrap. For a
variation with vanilla ice cream, add 1 Tab instant coffee to the
melted chocolate. I have in a hurry, bought icecream at the market
and with a melon spoon dipped the ice cream out into small balls,
frozen them hard and then dipped in the chocolate as above. A quick
delicious treat when you want that something extra but don't have the
time to spend making it or if you have the time, after the first
dipping and letting the chocolate freeze hard, dip a second time.

Pear & Chocolate Tart

chocolate

2 cup all purpose flour
1 1/2  stick of butter, unsalted, cut into; 1 inch slices
1  egg
1 pinch of salt
1/2  egg shell of water

Pastry:

Process butter and flour until crumbly.  Add egg and water, process
until a ball forms, remove from processor, wrap in cling film,
refrigerate 20 minutes. Cook the tart shell and cool. (He says
nothing of how long or what temperature!)

Tart:

5 pears, peeled, halved, cored, and poached in a simple syrup (2 c
water, 2 c sugar, 1 Tbsp vanilla) 6 oz semisweet chocolate 2 oz
butter 1 large jar apricot preserves 2 Tbsp grand Marnier

Poach pears in liquid until soft, about 30-40 minutes. Test for
doneness with a knife - if there is little resistance, pears are
done. Remove from liquid and cool

Melt the butter and chocolate over low heat, then pour into tart
shell. Halve the pears and make vertical cuts from the bottoms almost
up to the stem ends, spread out cut parts like a fan, and arrange in
the chocolate. Allow the chocolate to set.  Bring the apricot
preserves to a boil with the Grand Marnier, then brush very liberally
over the pears. Cool and serve. If this is made in advance and
refrigerated, take out and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Pecan Caramel Clusters

chocolate, candy, christmas

1 cup cream; light
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup; karo
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon butter or regular margarine
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 1/2 cup pecans; chopped
6 oz chocolate chips; semi-sweet

Heat the light cream in a heavy 2-quart saucepan to lukewarm (110
degrees F.).  Reserve 1/2 c cream and set it aside. Add the sugar,
corn syrup and salt to the remaining 1/2 cup of cream in the
saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the
mixture boils. Slow stir in the reserved cream. Cook, stirring
constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in the butter, 1 tsp at a time,
stirring constantly.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until
the mixture reaches the soft ball stage, (234 Degrees F.) on the
candy thermometer. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.
Arrange the pecans on a waxed-paper lined baking sheet. Drop the
mixture by teaspoonfuls onto the pecans. As the clusters cool, remove
with a metal spatula to another waxed-paper lined baking sheet. Push
the remaining pecans together and repeat until all of the candy
mixture is used. If the mixture becomes too thick, heat over low
heat. Melt the chocolate chips over hot water and stir until smooth.
Spread on the top of each pecan cluster.  Let stand until the
chocolate is set and store the candies in a cool place.

Pesach Hazelnut-Chocolate Viennese Torte)

chocolate, tortes

6 large eggs -- 5 of them separated
1 pinch salt
2 teaspoon lemon juice
3/4 cup sugar -- divided
2 teaspoon lemon rind -- grated
3 oz semisweet chocolate -- very
1  finely grated
2 1/2 cup unblanched nuts -- very
1  finely ground (
1  for torte:
1/4 cup sweet pesach wine
1/2 cup apricot jam
1  chocolate glaze:
1/3 cup water
3 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup cocoa
1  garnish: (optional)
1 cup nuts -- ground
12  hazelnuts
1 oz chocolate -- for curls

Grease a 9 inch springform pan well and coat it with potato starch or
sugar, tapping out excess.

For the batter, in a large mixing bowl, beat the 5 egg whites with
the salt and lemon juice until foamy. Very gradually add 1/4 cup
sugar and continue beating the whites until they form stiff, but not
dry, peaks.

Use the same beaters and another bowl to beat the 5 egg yolks and
additional egg with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and lemon rind until
very light and fluffy.  Gently but thouroughly fold the beaten whites
into yolks.  Fold in chocolate and nuts, and pour batter into pan.

Bake torte in a preheated 325 degree oven for 50-55 minutes or until
top springs back when gently pressed.

[this will not rise as much as you think it ought. Don't worry about
it]

Leave the torte in the oven, turn off the heat, and open the door
slightly. After 10 minutes remove torte from oven. Run a knife around
the edge of the torte to release it from the pan rim.  Cool it for
another 30 minutes in the pan. Remove the pan rim and cool the torte
completely on the bottom.

[This next part is for icing the Torte.  What I've done in the past
is make 2 layers, following the above directions, doubled the amount
of raspberry syrup and dribbled half over each torte as per the
directions and skipped the jam. I've then used the chocolate glaze as
an icing for between the layers, and the "Instant" Chocolate Mousse
recipe for the outside icing of the whole thing.  ]

Cover a 9 or 10 inch cardboard circle with heavy duty aluminum foil or
freezer paper or use a cake plate. Invert torte onto base and remove
pan bottom. Sprinkle wine [or whatever] evenly over torte. Heat jam
until thinned; then bruch or spread it all over the torte. (this adds
flavor and smooths the surface).

For the glaze, combine the water, oil, sugar, and cocoa in a small
suacepan and mix very well.  Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring
constantly, for 10-14 minutes, or until the glaze thickens slightly
and is very smooth and shiney.  For the best flavor and texture it
should not boil. Remove glaze from heat and stir 3-4 minutes longer
until it cools slightly and gets a bit thicker. Pour all the glaze in
the center of the torte and immediately use a metal or rubber spatula
to evenly spread it all over top and sides.  Wipe up any drips from
base.

Let torte rest a few minutes until the glaze begins to set, but is
still soft.

Press handfulls of ground nuts all over the sides, but not the top.
Arrange whole nuts, evenly spaced in circle on top about 1 inch from
edge. Heap chocolate curls or bits in center.

Refrigerate the uncovered, completed torte for several hours or,
preferably, overnight so the glaze will set and the flavors and
textures will "mellow".

(Once the glaze has set, the torte can be frozen for up to 3 weeks.
Freeze it uncovered, then wrap it in plastic wrap or tin foil. Unwrap
it before thawing and thaw for several hours in the refrigerator.

Raspberry Chocolate Crunch Sundae

chocolate, ice cream, godiva

      Raspberry Sauce-----
2 cup fresh raspberries -- or
1  thawed frozen
1/3 cup superfine sugar --
1  (instant-dissolving)
1/4 cup chambord raspberry liqueur
1 teaspoon lemon juice
      Assembly-----
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 pint raspberry sorbet and vanilla
1  ice cream -- * see note
1 pint chocolate ice cream
1/2 cup chocolate syrup
24  amaretti cookies
1/4 cup chambord
1/2 pint fresh raspberries

* such as Haagen Dazs Raspberry Sorbet and Cream.

Make the raspberry sauce:

1. In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, combine
the raspberries, sugar, Chambord, and lemon juice. Process the
mixture for 30 to 45 seconds, or until smooth. Strain the pure
through a fine-meshed sieve into a small bowl. Cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until chilled.

Assemble the sundaes:

1. In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer,
using the wire whip attachment, beat the cream, sugar, and vanilla at
medium-high speed until slightly stiff peaks begin to form. Transfer
the cream to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco #7)
and refrigerate the cream until ready to use.

2. Spoon about l 1/2 tablespoons of the raspberry sauce into the
bottom of a large sundae glass. Add 4 or 5 raspberries. Coarsely
crumble 2 amaretti cookies over the berries and drizzle with 1
teaspoon Chambord. Place a small scoop of the raspberry sorbet and
vanilla ice cream on top of the cookie layer. Drizzle about 1 1/2
tablespoons of the chocolate syrup over the scoop. Top with a scoop
of chocolate ice cream and a drizzle of raspberry sauce and 4 or 5
raspberries. Coarsely crumble 2 more amaretti cookies over the
berries and drizzle with 1 teaspoon Chambord. Top with a scoop of
raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream. Drizzle with some of the
raspberry sauce. Pipe a large rosette of whipped cream on top of the
sundae and garnish with fresh raspberries and an amaretti

cookie. Repeat this procedure to make 4 sundaes. Serve immediately.

1 1/2 oz ground almonds, divided
8 large eggs
1/2 cup granulated sugar, divided
1/4 cup red raspberry jam
2 cup raspberries, divided
2 oz semisweet chocolate chips

Real French Chocolate Mousse

chocolate, deserts

4  egg yolks
1/4 cup superfine sugar
2 tablespoon cognac
6 oz semi--sweet chocolate, cut into sma; ll chumnks
3 tablespoon strong coffee
8 tablespoon soft unsalted (sweet) butter (1 qua; rter lb stick) cut in 1/2
1  inch pieces
4  egg whites
1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped

Real French Chocolate Mousse

French Chocolate Mousse

Brush the inside of a 1 quart charlotte (cylindrical) or ring mold
with a film of veg. oil. Invert the mold on paper towels to drain. In
a heatproof mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar with a whisk,
rotary or electric beater for 2 or 3 minutes, or until they are pale
yellow and thick enough to form a ribbon when the whisk is lifted
from the bowl. Beat in the cognac. Set the mixing bowl over a pan of
barely simmering (not boiling) water, and continue beating for 3 or 4
minutes, or until the mixture is foamy and hot. Then set the bowl
over a pan of iced water and beat for 3 or 4 minutes longer, or until
the mixture is cool again and as thick and creamy as mayonaise. In a
heavy 4 to 6 cup saucepan, melt the chocolate with the coffee over
hot water, stirring constantly. When all of the chocolate has
dissolved, beat in the butter--one piece at a time--to make a smooth
cream. Then beat the chocolate mixture into the egg yolks and sugar.
In a seperate bowl, with a clean whisk or beater, beat the egg whites
until they are stiff enough to form stiff peaks on the wires of the
whisk. Stir about 1/4 of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to
lighten it, then very gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Spoon
the mousse into the oiled mold or dessert cups and refrigerate for at
least four hours or until it has set. To unmold and serve, run a long
sharp knife around the sides of the mold and dip the bottom of it in
hot water for a few seconds. Then wipe the outside of the mold dry,
place a chilled serving plate upside down over the mold and, grasping
both sides firmly, quickly turn the plate and mold over.  Rap the
plate on a table and the mousse should slide easily out of the mold.
If the mousse doesn't unmold at once, repeat the whole process. With
a wire whisk, rotary or electric beater, whip the chilled cream in a
large chilled bowl until it is firm enough to hold its shape softly.
Garnish the mousse with the whipped cream.

Roma's White Chocolate Bread Pudding

chocolate, deserts, puddings

      ----THE PUDDING----
6 cup heavy cream
2 cup milk, whole
1 cup sugar, granulated
10 oz chocolate, white; broken into small pieces
4  eggs
15  egg yolks
1  bread, french 24 loaf
      ----THE SAUCE----
8 oz chocolate, white; broken into pieces
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 oz chocolate, dark; for garnish

Preheat oven to 275F.
In a large saucepan, heat the whipping cream, milk and sugar over
medium heat until the mixture just begins to bubble around the edges
but is not boiling. Add the white chocolate pieces and stir until
melted. Remove from heat. Combine the whole eggs and the egg yolks in
a large bowl. Slowly pour the hot cream mixture into the eggs in a
steady stream, whipping the eggs as you pour. Slice the bread 1 inch
thick (Use stale bread, or slice the bread then dry in a 275^ oven
for about 10 minutes)
Place the bread in a pan measuring about 9 x 12 inches. Pour half
the egg mixture over the bread. Use your fingers to press the bread
into the mix so that it absorbs the liquid and becomes soggy. Pour in
the remaining mix. Cover the pan with foil and bake in a 350 degree
oven for 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 30
minutes, or until the pudding is set and top is golden brown. Make
the sauce: Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from
the heat and add the white chocolate, stirring until smooth and
completely melted. Spoon over the bread pudding.
To serve: You can either serve the bread pudding warm, spooned
right out of the pan and topped with the sauce and grated chocolate,
or prepare ahead of time for a more polished presentation. Chill the
bread pudding until completely set and firm, about 6 to 8 hours.
Loosen the sides from the pan with a knife and invert the pudding
onto a cutting surface. Cut into 6 squares, then cut the squares in
half to make 12 triangles. Place the triangles on a cookie sheet and
heat in a 275^ oven for 15 minutes. Serve with sauce and garnish with
chocolate shavings.

2 tablespoon cognac or kahlua
4 oz good-quality bittersweet or semi-sw; eet chocolate
1 cup whipping cream
1 1/2 tablespoon superfine sugar (omit if using semi; -sweet chocolate)

thicken. Whisk in cognac; continue to whisk until mixture has
thickened to the consistency of Hollandaise sauce. Remove from heat

soft peaks. If chocolate mixture has stiffened, heat gently over very
low heat, whisking constantly, until slightly softened. Transfer

in remaining whipped cream with a large whisk or spatula, then cut
through with a spatula or curved fingers to eliminate large air
bubbles. Set aside.

just until mixture holds stiff peaks. Stir a small amount of the egg
whites until chocolate mixture to lighten it; then fold in remaining
egg whites. Spoon into a serving bowl or 8 small molds. Refrigerate

1 cup raspberry or apricot jam
1 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoon cinnamon
2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup finely chopped hazelnuts or walnuts
1  egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup coarse sugar or finely chopped nuts

hour or overnight. (Let dough stand at room temperature for about 15
minutes before rolling)  In medium bowl combine brown sugar, cinnamon
and cocoa. Stir in hazelnuts.  Set aside until ready to use. On
lightly floured surface, roll each piece of dough into circle 10

Simple Chocolate Souffle

chocolate, deserts

25 gm cornflour
250 ml milk
100 gm good dark chocolate
50 gm sugar
3  egg yolks
5  egg whites
1 tablespoon extra sugar, caster if available.

It is a very light souffle, which doesn't sink *too* much when you
dig into it. If any is left over it is still very fluffy and yummy
when cold.

Mix cornflour to a thin paste with some of the milk. Put the
remaining milk in a saucepan with the chocolate and sugar, and stir
over a gentle heat until the chocolate melts and the sugar dissolves.

Add cornflour paste carefully and bring mixture to boil to thicken,
stirring continuously, then remove from heat.

Beat in egg yolks one by one, and leave mixture to cool slightly.
(You can prepare in advance this far and if needed warm the mixture
slightly before continuing.)

Beat egg whites until they begin to stand in soft peaks, then add
extra sugar and beat until the mixture stands in stiff peaks but is
not dry. Fold into chocolate mixture gently.

Immediately pour into greased and sugared 1 litre souffle dish (with a
paper collar), and bake at 190 degrees celsius for 40 - 45 minutes.
Serve immediately.

beverages, cheese/eggs, nuts, cheese

4 cup powdered sugar
8 oz cream cheese
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 oz unsweetened chocolate
1  assorted toppings such as
1  cocoa, powdered sugar,
1  crushed nuts, jimmies, etc.

Mix the powdered sugar into the softened cream cheese a little (2/3 cup) at
a time, making sure it is well blended after every addition.

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler and add it to the cream cheese
mixture along with the vanilla. Mix well. Chill for a couple hours. Roll
mix into one inch balls, then roll them in a topping. Chill.

NOTES:

*  Easy-to-make candies with chocolate and cream cheese -- Here's a good
recipe for lazy chocolate freaks.  They're not as good as the ones you buy
in good candy stores, but they're still yummy.

*  If you're adventurous, try substituting the liqueur of your choice for
the vanilla.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling, 20 minutes rolling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

S'mores

1  marshmallows
1  hershey bars
1  graham crackers
1  green sticks or coat
1  hangers

Get prepared by getting 1 large graham cracker and breaking it in
half. Cover 1/2 of the graham cracker with Hershey bar.

Put a marshmallow (or 2) on the stick and hold it over the fire until
roasted. Some people like them lightly golden, others like to catch
them on fire and then blow the fire out. If you do that, be careful.
You have to put the fire out quickly or your marshmallow will fall on
the ground. When the marshmallow's roasted, place on top of the
Hershey bar, put the other graham cracker on top and bite down. Yum!

Gather dough into a ball and flatten into roughly a 12 inch round.
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees. Roll
dough out between sheets of plastic wrap to 1/8 inch thickness. Trim
to an 11 inch circle (use tart pan as guide). Remove plastic wrap
from top and invert into a 10 inch round springform pan with
removable bottom. Remove plastic wrap and press into bottom and up
sides of pan...  crimp top edges. Freeze for 15 minutes. Line tart
shell with aluminum foil and weight with pie weights or beans. Bake

crust until golden brown - about 16-20 minutes. Sprinkle two ounces
of white chocola te over hot crust. Let stand for about 1 minute.
Using the back of a spoon, spread chocolate over bottom and up sides.
Transfer to rack to cool.

For mousse: Melt white chocolate with 1/4 C heavy cream in a small
heavy saucepan over very low heat, stirring constantly. Pour into
bowl. Let stand until just cool. Beat egg white in a small bowl until
soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff but not
dry. Fold whipped cream, 1 tbsp. liqueuer, and egg white into
chocolate mixture. Spoon mousse into prepared pan, spreading evenly.
Refrigerate until mousse is set (2 hours or overnight (can be made
ahead and frozen at this point)).

To assemble: Fan all strawberries by making several legthwise cuts in
each, starting 1/4 inch from base and extending through the tip. Fan
with fingertips. Bring jam and remaining 1 tbsp. liqueuer to a boil
in a heavy small saucepan, stirring constantly. Transfer to processor
and puree. Brush thin layer of jam over mouse. Place 2 fanned
strawberries with stems on opposing sides of mousse. Arrange smaller
fanned strawberries atop artistically.

      Bowl-----
1 tablespoon unsalted butter -- softened
3 tablespoon flour -- or more
4 large eggs
1 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup cake flour -- sifted
5 oz semisweet chocolate
1 cup heavy cream -- chilled
1 cup fresh orange juice --
1  sweetened to taste
2 tablespoon grand marnier -- (optional)
1 pint fresh raspberries
      For Decoration-----
7 oz semisweet chocolate --
1  melted
6  to 8
1  lemon, orange o
1 tablespoon cocoa powder -- in a fine
1  sieve
      Raspberry Sauce-----
1 1/2 cup fresh raspberries
1/2 cup sugar -- or more
2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1  fresh green leaves such as

Preparing the Genoise Sponge Cake:  Preliminaries. Using the pastry
brush, butter an 8-inch (4 cup) stainless steel bowl (one you can
bake in) quite generously and coat with flour (knock out the excess).

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Cake batter:  Beat eggs and sugar in bowl of
mixer for 5 minutes until thick, fluffy and tripled in volume.
Rapidly sift and fold in flour with big rubber spatula and scoop
batter into prepared bowl. bake in middle level of preheated oven for
35 to 45 minutes until toothpick stuck in middle comes out clean.
Turn out onto rack to cool completely (1 hour) before proceeding.

Melt the chocolate: Bring 2 inches of water to simmer and set bowl
over it, add 5 oz of chocolate and remove from heat. When completely
melted, remove bowl from water and let cool to room temp.

Whip cream into soft peaks and set bowl over ice water. Fold half the
cream into cooled (but liquid) chocolate; when incorporated, fold in
the rest to complete the mousse.

Assembling the cake:  (Taste the OJ to be sure it's sweet enough and
add Grand Marnier if desired.  Shave off crusty top of cake (it won't
absorb the OJ) Use a serrated knife to slice the Genoise into 3
layers of equal thickness.  Line 8 inch bowl with plastic wrap. Fit
round top piece of cake into bowl, brush with about 4 tab of OJ.
Spoon 1/3 of the mousse onto soaked layer and strew on a handful of
raspberries. Place the next layer ontop of the mousse, brush with 1/3
cup of OJ and spoon on rest of mousse, a handful of raspberries and
put on the last layer of cake. Brusk on the last of the juice. Bring
the hanging edges of plastic over the top, cover with another piece
of plastic and refrigerate for several hours before decorating.
Making chocolate icing: Melt remaining chocolate in a bowl over
simmering water (same as mousse)  Remove plastic covering from cake
and unmold domed-side up onto a rack, then peel off and discard
plastic. Lightly dampen your work surface so a 12 inch sheet of
plastic wrap will adhere.  Using rubber spatula, spread a thin 10-11
inch disk of cool liquid chocolate in the center of the sheet.
Rapidly slide plastic ito the bowl, so chocolate disc covers bottom
and sides of bowl. gently drop the chilled cake, domed side down,
into bowl, fold plastic wrap over it and refrigerate.

Makeing chocolate leaves: Dip the inside of each leaf into remaining
melted chocolate and place on a plate, coated side up. Refrigerate
until chocolate hardens.

Decorating cake:  Remove cake from fridge and fold back wrap. Turn
domed-side up onto serving cake and lift off plastic wrap. Sprinkle
with dusting of powder. Make a ring of raspberries around edge of
cake and pour a little raspeberry sauce over them. Affix chocolate

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast the pecan halves on a baking sheet
in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
Combine 1 1/4 cups of sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan.
Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand).
Caramelize the sugar for 8 to 10 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring
constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar will first turn
clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it caramelizes). Remove the
saucepan from the heat. Add the unsweetened chocolate and stir gently to
blend. Pour the chocolate-caramel mixture over the pecans and stir with a
spoon to completely coat the pecans with the chocolate caramel; spread the
mixture evenly over the bottom of the baking sheet. Freeze the chocolate

4 oz good-quality white chocolate, 1-inc; h pieces
1/2  vanilla bean

*DIRECTIONS  +++*

1.  Heat the cream almost to a simmer in a heavy medium-size saucepan.
Remove the cream from the bowl, and divide it among three mixing
bowls in these amounts: 1-1/4 c, 1 c., 3/4 c.

2.  Stir the bittersweet chocolate into the 1-3/4 c. cream, whisking
until smooth.  Stir the milk chocolate into the 1 c. cream, whisking
until smooth.  Stir the white chocolate into the 3/4 c. cream, and
add the seeds from the vanilla bean; stir until smooth.  Cover the
three bowls loosely and refrigerate until the mixtures are thick but
still pourable, 3 hours.

3.  Line a 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 in. loaf pan with aluminum foil. Leave some
foil above the edge of the pain.

4.  Transfer the white chocolate mixture to a mixer bowl, and beat
until it forms soft peaks--be careful not to overbeat it. Beat the
last two or three strokes by hand; the mixture should be thick and
firm. Scrape it into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and chill it
in the freezer for 5 minutes.

5.  Repeat the beating process with the milk chocolate mixture and
spread it over the white chocolate mixture in the loaf pan. Smooth
the top, and freeze for 5 minutes.

6.  Repeat again with the bittersweet chocolate. Spread it over the
milk chocolate mixture, smooth the top, and cover with plastic wrap.

Truffes Au Chocolat (Chocolate Truffles)

chocolate, candy, christmas, holiday

3 oz chocolate
1 1/2 oz butter
2 oz powdered sugar
2 tablespoon fresh cream

Preparation: Put cream, butter and grated chocolate into a pan. The
chocolate need not be grated fine. The cream can be replaced by
skimming the top off raw milk poured into a wide basin and allowed to
settle. Melt butter, chocolate, and cream in a double boiler,
stirring to mix well. When melted, remove the double boiler from the
fire, leaving the hot water in the bottom pan to keep it warm. Sift
the powdered sugar in slowly, so that it will not form lumps,
stirring constantly. Let stand 24 hr. in a cool place. (In winter, 12
hr. in a cold room will do.) At the end of this time, cut a piece of
this chocolate about the size of a small nut, using a knife or spoon.
Roll it into a ball in the palm of the hand until the outside of the
bonbon begins to melt a little. Then roll it in grated or granulated
chocolate, which will stick to it perfectly. Let stand 2 hr. before
serving, but in a place that is not too cold, because these truffles
are better when they are a little soft. Instead of rolling them into
balls, you can also shape them to look more like truffles.

Truffes Pralinees (Praline Truffles)

chocolate, candy

1/2 lb good chocolate
1  about 1/2 glass water
3  egg yolks
3 oz butter
1 1/2 oz praline paste

Slowly melt the chocolate in the water, bring to a gentle boil,
remove from the fire, and add the yolks, beating with a spatula, then
replace on a low fire to poach the eggs in the chocolate. Do not stop
beating. Remove from the fire and add the butter and the praline
paste. Let cool, beating from time to time (this cooling takes a
rather long time). When the mixture begins to solidify, take some
with a spoon, place it in some grated chocolate (prepared in
advance), and shape to resemble real truffles. These truffles keep a
week. To keep a longer time, substitute vegetable shortening for the
butter.

is not only simple, it's flexible. It can be made with other kinds of
liquor (amaretto, sherry, and Southern Comfort work well), nuts
(almonds or pecans, for instance) and coatings (ground nuts, finely
grated coconut, etc.) and always comes out tasting great. Adding
small chunks of nut for texture is also effective.

White Chcoclate Mousse -1

chocolate, mousses

10 oz white chcoclate -- broken in
20  pcs
4 tablespoon water
2 cup heavy cream

Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over low
heat. When the water is hot (do not allow to simmer), place white
chocolate and 4 tablespoons of water in the top half of the double
boiler. Using a rubber spatula, constantly stir the white chocolate
and water until melted, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and
keep at room temperature until needed.

Place the heavy cream in a well-chilled bowl of an electric mixer
fitted with a well-chilled balloon whip. Mix on high until stiff,
about 1 minute. Remove the bowl from the mixer.  Using a hand-held
whisk, vigorously whisk 1/3 of the whipped cream into the melted
white chocolate. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula, and
continue to whisk until smooth and thoroughly combined.  Add the
combined whipped cream and white chocolate to the remaining whipped
cream and use a rubber spatula to fold together until smooth.

Transfer to a container and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before
serving.

White Chocolate "Ravioli" W/ Hazelnut Filling

chocolate, deserts

1/2 cup hazelnuts, whole, shelled
2 oz chocolate, semisweet
2 tablespoon butter, unsalted
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon brandy *or: 1 tbsp rum
9 oz chocolate, white, grated

FROM:      Sallie Austin

Filling Number of Servings:  25

1. Preheat oven to 350-F. Form a sheet of tinfoil over the back of a
9 inch square baking pan. Place the foil in the pan and smooth it
into corners and sides as evenly as possible.

2. Place the hazelnuts in a roasting pan. Put them in oven and roast
for 10 minutes, then place nuts in a heavy kitchen towel and rub them
back and forth vigorously, so that their bitter dried skins are
removed. Pick over and discard all skins. Grind the nuts coarsely or
chop in a food processor.

3. Melt the dark chocolate and butter over hot water. Stir in sugar,
brandy, and nuts, and mix well. Form paste into 25 small balls.

4. Arrange the chocolate balls in 5 even rows over the bottom of the
dish, and press each ball down so that it is somewhat flattened
against the bottom of the pan.

5. Place the grated white chocolate over hot water and let it melt
completely. Stir until smooth, then immediately pour the chocolate
into the center of the pan and over as many chocolate rounds as
possible. Using a finger, smooth the chocolate evenly over the balls,
out to the edge of the pan in a thin, flat layer.

6. Place the pan in refrigerator briefly, until the chocolate hardens
somewhat but does not completely firm. Run a knife or ravioli cutter
between the rows and down the sides, then replace dish in the
refrigerator to harden. When firm, lift out the foil and separate the
candies into individual pieces.

My notes: *very* easy. excellent.  impressive.  Used Droest (Holland)
white chocolate (in octagonal package) - chopped in food processor -
melted easily. Nestle's Treasures/Premier White also worked well.

White Chocolate Baby Dinosaur Egg (Kh)

candy

1  plastic egg mold
1  non-stick cooking spray
1 lb white chocolate (containing
1  paraffin)
1  cotton candy
1  candy dinosaurs

Melt chocolate over medium heat in double boiler until evenly smooth.
Lightly coat each inside egg mold half with nonstick spray. Pour in
about 1/2 cup melted chocolate in 1/2 mold and "roll" mold around
gently so gravity makes the chocolate flow over entire inside
surface. Pour in more to thicken out any thin spots if necessary.
Repeat with other half. Refrigerate 10-15 minutes. Save 2-3
tablespoons of chocolate to seal egg. Dip each outer half in warm
water to loosen egg shell and invert it on a plate. Repeat with other
half. If you crack or break the shell, remelt and try again.

Place cotton candy nest in bottom half of egg, place candy Dinosaur
into cotton candy nest and cover with top half of shell. Seal the
seam with remaining melted chocolate, and smooth with your finger.

Your Dinosaur egg is now ready to present. Hatch the egg by rapping
the top shell with the back of a spoon to reveal the candy Baby
Dinosaur inside.

White Chocolate Bavarois

deserts

1  egg
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 liter whipping cream
2  sheets of gelatine
1 tablespoon white rum
150 gm white chocolate
5 tablespoon milk

Break chocolate into pieces and put in a bowl and add the milk. Heat
it 'au bain marie'(*) and stir occasionally until chocolate has
melted. Even better: put the bowl in the microwave, heat for 2 times
2 minutes on low and stir well. Make sure the chocolate doesn't get
too hot, because it will get lumpy (gritty) and useless. Let the
melted chocolate cool down to room temperature, by putting it in a
larger bowl with cold water.

Put egg & sugar in a large bowl. Mix with an electric mixer until
white and creamy (about 8 minutes).

Soak the gelatine leaves in lots of cold water for about 5 minutes or
until soft.

Heat two tablespoons of water in a bowl / small pan until cooking.
Remove from heat and solve the wrung-out gelatine in it. Let it cool
a little.

Put the rum, the melted chocolate and the solved gelatine into the
bowl with the egg mixture. Fold together carefully with a large spoon
(or two).

Put the mixture in the fridge and let it set just a little or until
you finished the next task...being:

Whip the cream until stiff.

Carefully fold the cream into the rest of the pudding. Put it in small
bowls or one large bowl.

Serve with chocolate sauce (i just buy a bottle).

(*) au bain marie =
put the bowl in a larger pan with water. Heat the water and wait
until 	the stuff in the bowl is heated.

White Chocolate Bread Pudding With White Choc

deserts

1  roll, 10 long and 2 1/2
1  in diameter or the equi-
1  valent amount of bread
2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
9 oz white chocolate, chopped
1  egg
4  egg yolks
1  semi-sweet chocolate for
1  garnish (optional)

Cut the roll into eight slices; place on middle rack of a 250F oven
and leave until dry, about 20 minutes. In a saucepan, heat 1 1/2 cups
of the heavy cream, the milk, and the sugar over low heat, stirring
until sugar is dissolved.  Add 5 oz. of the white chocolate, stir
until melted, and remove from the heat.  In a large bowl, whisk the
egg and yolks together. Whisk the chocolate mixture into the eggs a
little at a time. Tear the bread into 1" pieces, add to the white
chocolate custard, and stir to mix. Leave to soak, stirring
occasionally, until all the custard has been absorbed by the bread, 1
to 2 hours.  Put the mixture into an 8" square, 2" deep baking dish.
Put the dish in a slightly large pan and add hot water to come
halfway up the sides of the baking dish.  Bake the pudding in the
water bath at 350F for 45-50 minutes, until the custard is set and
the top is golden brown. Serve warm or cold. If you chill it, loosen
the sides with a metal spatula and invert the pudding onto a cutting
surface. Cut into four squares and cut each square into a triangle.
For the sauce, heat the remaining cream in a small pan.  Add the
remaining 4 oz. white chocolate and melt.  If desired, grate some
semi-sweet chocolate and sprinkle on top of the pudding.

The Palace Cafe, located on New Orleans' Canal Street in the old
Werlein's Building, is the newest restaurant from the Brennan family,
who also operate some of the City's finest restaurants: Commander's
Palace, Mr. B's Bistro and Bacco. This dessert has become extremely
popular, and has practically become The Palace Cafe's signature
dessert.

You will absolutely slay your guests if you make this. I've had dinner
guests describe this dessert as "orgasmic", and "the best dessert
I've ever had".

Heat the cream in a double boiler and add the white chocolate; when
the chocolate is melted, remove from heat.

In a double boiler, heat the milk, sugar, eggs and egg yolks until
warm. Blend the egg mixture into the cream and chocolate mixture.

Place the bread slices in a baking pan. Pour 1/2 of the mixture over
the bread and let settle for a while, making sure the bread soaks up
all the mixture. Top with the rest of the mixture. Cover with
aluminum foil and bake at 275 degrees for 1 hour. Remove the foil and
bake for an additional 15 minutes until the top is golden brown.

For the sauce: Gently melt the white chocolate in a double boiler.
Remove from heat and mix in heavy cream. Spoon over bread pudding.

White Chocolate Lasagna With Peanut Ice Cream

chocolate, deserts, ice cream

3 1/2 cup half & half
8  egg yolks
1 3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup unsalted dry-roasted peanuts, coars; ely chopped (about 5 oz)
3 oz bars white chocolate, broken in hal; f widthwise
16 oz bittersweet chocolate
8 oz unsalted butter
1 cup evaporated milk

Servings:  4

Mint sprigs for garnish

In medium saucepan, scald the half & half over medium heat, set
aside. In medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 3/4 cup sugar, a
pinch of salt, and 1 tsp of the vanilla. Gradually whisk in the half
& half and transfer to the saucepan.  Cook this mixture over moderate
heat, stirring constantly, until just thick enough to coat the back
of a spoon (165 on a candy thermometer). This will take 10-15
minutes. DO NOT bring to a boil or you'll have a curdled mess on your
hands. Remove from heat and whisk in the peanut butter, then add the
cream. Strain this custard into a bowl and refrigerate, stirring
occasionally, until well chilled. In the meantime, line a 10-by-15
inch jelly roll pan with wax paper. Transfer custard to a Donvier or
other ice cream freezer and freeze until thickened but still
pourable.  Add peanuts.  Pour mixture into the jelly roll pan, spread
evenly, cover, and freeze overnight.

Prepare sugar syrup by mixing the remaining 1 cup of sugar with 1 cup
of water.  Bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar, then remove from
heat and set aside 'til later.

Preheat oven on lowest setting for 5 minutes, then turn it off. Place
the 6 pieces of white chocolate on a large baking sheet lined with
wax paper. Place in the warm oven until soft enough to yield when
pressed by a finger, about 6 minutes.  Using a metal spatula,
transfer a piece of softened chocolate to an individual piece of wax
paper (at least 12 inches long) and cover with a second sheet of
paper.  Using a large heavy rolling pin, gently roll the chocolate
between the paper to form a thin sheet of chocolate, about 11 by 4
inches. Set each sheet of chocolate aside while you repeat this with
the rest of the chocolate. Line 3 baking sheets with wax paper.  When
the white chocolate is cooled and firm, remove the top piece of paper
from each chocolate sheet. Using a pizza wheel or long sharp knife,
trim the edges of each sheet to make a neat 3-by-10-inch rectangle,
then cut each rectangle crosswise to form two 3-by-5-inch pieces.
Transfer 4 rectangles to each of the prepared baking sheets. Keep
cool.

In a double boiler, melt the bittersweet chocolate with the butter,
stirring until smooth.  Transfer to a bowl. Whisk in 1 cup of the
reserved sugar syrup. Stir in the evaporated milk and 1 tsp. vanilla.
Set aside, covered.  Note:  this sauce can be made up to 1 week in
advance and kept, covered, in the fridge.

With a pizza cutter or thin sharp knife, cut the ice cream into ten 3
by-5-inch rectangles.  There will be a little left over; do what you
will with it. ;-) With a spatula, place a piece of the ice cream on
each of the 4 pieces of white chocolate.  Top each with another piece
of chocolate, then another layer of ice cream, then another piece of
chocolate. Freeze for 3 to 4 hours.

To serve, remove the assembled lasagnas from the freezer and allow to
soften slightly at room temperature for a few minutes. Gently reheat
the fudge sauce in the top of a double boiler or in the microwave.
Place each of the portions to serving plates, spoon fudge sauce over,
garnish with mint, and serve immediately.

White Chocolate Mint Truffles

candy

1/2 lb white chocolate; cut into small pieces
1/2 cup packed, fresh mint leaves (green or; white)
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon creme de menthe
6 tablespoon unsalted butter; cut into small pieces

To make the truffles: Melt the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl
set over gently simmering water. When chocolate is almost melted,
turn off the heat and let stand until completely melted, stirring
occasionally.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, steep mint leaves in cream and creme
de menthe until liquid is very flavorful (amount of time depends upon
the strength of the mint leaves). Then bring just to a simmer,
strain, pressing down on the mint leaves to give as much flavor as
possible, and whisk into the melted chocolate. Place the pieces of
butter around the warm mixture and let the butter melt. When melted,
stir to mix well. Pour mixture into a shallow pan, giving you a
1-inch-thick layer of chocolate. Cool completely and then refrigerate
or freeze until very firm.

To form the truffles: Have a small bowl of very hot water ready and
replace the water as it cools down. Line a baking tray with parchment
paper. Remove truffle base from the refrigerator or freezer. Before
scooping out a ball of chocolate, dip the melon baller into the hot
water, shaking to remove any excess water. Scoop out a truffle,
tapping the melon baller on a firm surface to release the truffle.
Quickly roll between the palms of your hands and place on the
prepared baking tray. You will have to wash your hands in cold water
often to prevent the chocolate from sticking to your hands. Repeat
this procedure until all the balls have been scooped and rolled. If
the truffle base begins to soften too much, refrigerate or freeze
until firm and then continue to scoop out the truffles. Refrigerate
or freeze until needed. Makes 45 to 50 small truffles.

White Chocolate Mousse-Chef Apuzzo Of Andrea'

deserts, puddings

16 oz white chocolate
1 cup heavy whipping cream
3  eggs, separated
1/4 cup brandy
1/4 cup hot water
1 tablespoon vanilla
2 oz sugar

White chocolate is not actually chocolate at all, but cocoa butter
with the chocolate liquor left out. This dessert was originally
concieved as a dark chocolate mousse by Chef Andrea Apuzzo of
Andrea's Restaurant in Metairie, Louisiana, when he was executive
chef at the Royal Orleans Hotel before opening Andrea's. It is served
piped into a chocolate cup, which is then placed in a pool of
raspberry sauce.

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat. It's a good idea
to stand over the chocolate while it is melting and stir it until it's
completely melted, then take it off the heat immediately.

Whip the cream and set aside. Pour the brandy and hot water slowly
into a bowl with the egg yolks, whisking briskly as you go until
completely mixed.

Whisk in the melted chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is
completely combined; this will help to cool the chocolate. Whip the
egg whites and the sugar until peaking but not dry; add the vanilla
to the egg whites and sugar as you beat them.

Fold the egg-white meringue into the chocolate mixture carefully with
a wooden spoon.

Fold in the whipped cream. THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF THE
RECIPE. The key to a great chocolate mousse is that you can't
incorporate hot melted chocolate into whipped cream. The chocolate
mixture must be cool to the touch or the cream will break. Lightly
blend the two mixtures until uniform.  Walt MM

flatten slightly. Lift chocolate off paper, using a thin knife if
necessary. Turn pasta machine to widest setting. Run chocolate
through. Adjust pasta machine to next narrower setting. Run chocolate
through the machine again.

Repeat, narrowing follers after each run until chocolate is 1/16 inch
thick. Quickly press chocolate into chilled ravioli mold.

Fill each ravioli with 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of mousse filling.
Repeat rolling with second piece of chocolate, resoftening in oven as

White Chocolate Shortbread

chocolate, deserts

4 1/2 oz coarsely chopped white chocolate
1/4 lb unsalted butter, at room temperatur; e
1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
1 cup plus 2 tbsp flour, sifted

FROM:      DEREK MADDOX

One of our family's favorite cookies is shortbread. It's easy to
make, and VERY easy to eat.  This recipe also includes white
chocolate -- what more could you ask for. I was going to make this
shortbread tonight, but discovered that someone has eaten all my
white chocolate! I haven't determined the culprit yet, but my 7-year
old son is my number one suspect!

1. Preheat oven to 400 deg F.  Lightly butter a 9-inch pie pan (or
your favorite shortbread mold).  Using a food processor fitted with a
metal blade, chop the white chocolate using on-off pulses, until it
resembles coarse meal.

2. Using an electric mixer set at medium speed, cream the butter with
the sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the flour. Stir in
the chopped white chocolate.

3. Pat the dough evenly into the prepared pan. Using the tip of a
sharp knife, score the dough into eight equal triangles.

4. Bake the shortbread until light golden in color, about 30 minutes.
Transfer in the pan to a wire rack to cool slightly. Remove the
shortbread from the pan and cool completely on the wire rack. Store
in an airtight container at room temperature.

White Chocolate Veloutes 1

chocolate, godiva

1  sponge cake:
8 tablespoon unsalted butter -- softened
1 1/4 cup granulated sugar -- divided
3  eggs -- separated at room
1  te
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  grated rind of 1 lemon
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder

ds SALT 1/3 c  MILK WHITE CHOCOLATE VELOUTE: 14 oz WHITE CHOCOLATE 2 c
HEAVY CREAM 4    EGGS PINCH SALT 1/4 c GRANULATED SUGAR 1 pk
UNFLAVORED POWDERED GELATIN 1/4 c  COLD WATER ASSEMBLY: 1/4 c
FRAMBOISE LIQUEUR 1/2 pt FRESH RASPBERRIES 1/4 c SEEDLESS RASPBERRY
JAM WHITE CHOCOLATE CURLS: 8 oz CHUNK WHITE CHOCOLATE, -ABOUT
3/4-INCH THICK RASPBERRY SAUCE: 3 c UNSWEETENED FROZEN RASP -BERRIES
1/2 c GRANULATED SUGAR Make the sponge cake: Position a rack in the
center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-by-18 inch
jelly roll pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the
short ends of the pan. Butter the aluminum foil and the sides of the
pan. Lightly dust thebottom of the pan with flour and tap out the
excess.

In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the paddle
attachment, beat the butter at medium-high speed 1 minute, until
smooth. While continuing to beat, add 1 cup of the sugar in a steady
stream. Beat 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture is light and creamy.
Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, stopping to scrape down the side
of the bowl if necessary. Beat in the vanilla andlemon rind, and
continue to beat for 2 minutes.

Sift the flour and baking powder together onto a piece of waxed
paper. Set aside.

In a grease-free 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer,
using the wire whip attachment, beat the egg whites with the salt at
low speed until frothy. Gradually increase the speed to medium-high
and continue beating the whites until they start to form soft peaks.
One teaspoon at a time, gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar
and continue to beat the whites until they form stiff, shiny peaks.

Beating at low speed, alternately add the flour mixture and milk to
the yolk mixture. Continue to beat at low speed for 1 minute. Using a
balloon whisk or large rubber spatula, fold the beaten whites into
the egg yolk mixture one-third at a time. Scrape the batter into the
prepared pan and spread it into a thin, even layer with an offset
metal cake spatula.

Bake the sponge cake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the center springs
back when gently pressed with a finger. Transfer the pan to a wire
rack and cool for 10 minutes. Using the foil edges as handles, lift
the cake from the pan and set it on a wire rack to cool completely.

Make the ring molds: Cut eight 9 1/2-by-2 1/2-inch strips out of stiff
paper (unused manila folders work well). Bring the short ends of each
strip together, overlapping by 1/2 inch, and tape the outside seams
with masking tape. The ring molds should be approximately 2 3/4
inches in diameter.

Line the molds: Using a 2 3/4-inch round cookie cutter or one of the
prepared ring molds, cut out 8 rounds of the sponge cake. Reserve the
remaining sponge cake for garnish. Line a baking sheet with aluminum
foil and place the cake rounds on it. Moisten each cake round with
some of the Framboise liqueur. Place one ring mold over each cake
round, so that the mold touches the bottom of the baking sheet.

Make the white chocolate veloute: Melt the white chocolate according
to the directions in the Chocolate Key. Set aside to cool.

In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using
the wire whip attachment, whip the cream until it just begins to
mound. Set aside in the refrigerator.

White Chocolate Veloutes 2

chocolate, godiva

1 e *****

Part 2........

In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the wire
whip attachment, beat the eggs and the salt at medium-high speed
until frothy. Add the sugar in a steady stream and beat just until
blended. Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and place over a pot of
hot water. (The bottom of the bowl must touch the water. ) Cook over
medium-high heat, whisking constantly for 3 to 5 minutes, or until
the granules of sugar have dissolved and the egg mixture has reached
140 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Return the bowl to the
mixer stand and beat at medium-high speed until the mixture is thick
and pale yellow, about 8 minutes.

Place the cold water in a small, heatproof cup. Sprinkle the gelatin
over the water and let it stand for 5 minutes to soften the gelatin.
Place the cup with the softened gelatin in a saucepan with enough
water to come halfway up the side of the cup. Heat the gelatin
mixture over hot, not simmering, water. Stir the gelatin frequently
for 3 to
4    minutes, or until the gelatin granules dissolve completely
and the mixture is clear. Remove the pan from the heat. Whisk the
dissolved gelatin mixtureinto the beaten egg mixture. Using a large
rubber spatula, fold the cooled white chocolate into the mixture.
Fold one-third of the whipped cream into the mixture to lighten it.
Fold in the remaining whipped cream.

Assemble the veloutes: Fill a pastry bag fitted with a plain l/2-inch
round tip with some of the veloute mixture. Pipe a circle of filling
into the bottom of each mold, on top of the cake round. Pipe more
veloute to fill in the center of the circle so that the entire cake
round is covered with a level layer of filling, approximately
one-third up the side of the mold. In each mold, place 6 to 7
raspberries in a circle on top of the filling, leaving a l/4-inch
border of filling around the edge. Place 1 teaspoon of raspberry jam
in the center of each raspberry circle.

Pipe more veloute filling into each mold, to fill completely. Using a
small metal cake spatula, scrape the top of each mold to make the
filling level with the top of the mold. Cover the molds with plastic
wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight, until set.

Make the warm chocolate curls: Warm the 8-ounce chunk of white
chocolate by placing it on a piece of waxed paper, then microwave on
MEDIUM (50 percent) power for 10 second intervals, until the
chocolate starts to soften slightly. The chocolate should soften
slightly, not melt.

Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Grip the chocolate chunk with a
folded paper towel so that your hand does not melt the chocolate.
Using a sharp vegetable peeler, scrape one of the edges of the
chocolate chunk in a downward motion, forming loose shavings. As you
form the curls, let them fall onto the waxed paper. Continue making
curls until you have enough to garnish just the tops of the veloutes.

Make the crumb garnish: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a
baking sheet with aluminum foil. Break the reserved sponge cake into
small pieces and spread in an even layer on the baking sheet. Bake
5to 7 minutes, until the cake is dry and lightly toasted. Allow the
cake pieces to cool. Place the cake "toast" in a food processor
fitted with the metal chopping blade and process 30 to
45    seconds, or until fine crumbs are formed. Transfer the
crumbs to a medium bowl.

Make the raspberry sauce: In a medium non-corrosive saucepan, combine
the raspberries and sugar. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon, until the sugar dissolves completely
and the berries soften. Remove the pan from the heat. Strain the
raspberry mixture through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl. Cover the
bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the sauce.

Unmold and garnish the veloutes: Remove the molds from the
refrigerator and gently peel the tape off the seams. Carefully remove
the molds from the veloutes . Gently pat the cake crumbs around the
sides of each veloute, covering them evenly from the top edge to the
bottom. Top the veloutes with the white chocolate curls.

White Chocolate-Coconut Truffles

chocolate, candy

4 tablespoon (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
8 oz white chocolate; finely chop
1 cup shredded sweetened coconut; divided
1  large egg yolk; at room temperature
2 tablespoon coconut liqueur or light rum
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Melt the butter in a heatproof bowl over very hot, not simmering,
water. Add the white chocolate and melt, stirring occasionally, just

set over hot water, place the chocolate and oil. stir until almost
melted. Remove the top of the double boiler from the heat and stir
until the chocolate has completely melted.  continue to stir until
the chocolate has cooled and reaches a temperature of 90 degrees.

4. Prepare 2 baking sheets by lining with aluminum foil. Dip each
candy center in the melted chocolate, shake off the excess and place
on the baking sheet. When you have dipped a row of candies, top each
with a little of the chocolate- covered coffee bean.  Before each
dipping, stir the chocolate vigorously with your fingers. If the
centers become too soft, chill for about 30 minutes.

5. Let the candies set for about 2 hours before storing in
refrigeration. If the centers start to come through the bottoms of
the chocolates, as often happens with soft mixtures, dip the bottoms
again in melted and cooled chocolate.
