      Title: SIMPLE CORN BREAD
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Cornmeal
      1 c  Whole wheat flour (ww pastry
           Flour will work)
      4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Honey
      2 c  Frozen corn (canned would
           Probably work)
 
  In a blender, combine water, honey, and 1 cup of the corn. Blend until
  liquified. In a bowl, combine dry ingredients, and mix together. Pour
  in blended liquid, and mix. Mix in last cup of corn.
  
  Spritz a 9" round glass pan with oil spray, and sprinkle with
  cornmeal. Pour batter into pan, and put in oven. Turn oven on to 350
  deg. F, and bake for 30 minutes. (If you pre-heat oven, you may need
  to shorten the time). You can test for doneness. This can be ready
  from cupboard to mouth in 42 or so minutes.
  
  The original source was David Wallis, but there have been some
  updates.
  
  NOTE: As far as the spray adding to the %CFF, I think that most of it
  is absorbed by the cornmeal dusted over the spray. When I pop the
  bread out of the pan, there is a 'film' left. It sure makes getting
  bread out quick, easy, and hot!

      Title: SIMPLE FF CREAM CHEESE ICING (LACTO)
 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  FF cream cheese
        x  Maple syrup
 
  Use a blender, and put in Maple syrup until the mixture is sweet
  enough. Only disadvage: if you keep it in the fridge for a while,
  some cracks appear in the icing. So, I suggest you cool the icing in
  a bowl, then put it on just before serving the cake.

      Title: SIMPLE GRILLED EGGPLANT
 Categories: Side dishes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Eggplant
    1/3 c  Olive oil; virgin
    1/4 c  Italian parsley; chopped
           Salt; to taste
           Parsley; finely chopped
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Recipe by: Joel.Ehrlich@salata.com (Joel Ehrlich) If using large
  eggplant, remove the stems, then slice the eggplants horizontally
  1/2" thick. Small eggplants should be sliced vertically 1/2" thick.
  Place the eggplant slices in a large, heavy plastic bag such as a
  freezer bag. Add the olive oil, salt and pepper to the bag, close the
  top and toss the eggplant with the seasonings until the slices are
  evenly coated. Preheat a grill. Grill the eggplant slices over
  medium-high heat until tender and attractively browned. Do not allow
  them to char. For a picnic, layer the grilled eggplant slices in a
  large, shallow plastic container and sprinkle each layer with the
  parsley. Alternatively, arrange the slices on a platter and sprinkle
  with parsley. Serve at room temperature.

      Title: SIMPLE HERBAL GIFTS: A LITTLE COOKING WREATH
 Categories: Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Wreath
 
           Stiff chive flower stalks
           -(regular or garlic chives)
           Long sprigs of thyme
           Long sprigs of parsley
           Long sprigs of oregano
           Long sprigs of marjoram
           Long seed heads of basil
           Short sprigs of sage
           Short sprigs of rosemary
           Dried chili peppers
 
  Small herb wreaths like this one can go directly into the soup pot,
  or you can hang one in the kitchen to be plucked from as needed.
  Present them in plastic bags to hold their flavors and minimize their
  shattering.
  
  Twist chive stalks into a 4- to 5-inch circle to form a base for the
  wreath.  Twist in sprigs of thyme, parsley, oregano, and marjoram and
  basil seed heads to fill out the wreath. Add a single short sprig of
  rosemary or sage.  Let dry thoroughly; the wreath will shrink
  slightly. Thread three or four dried chilis on sewing thread and tie
  around top of wreath. Cover thread with a tie of kitchen twine or a
  narrow ribbon.

      1 tb Soy sauce (dark)
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 ts Oil
      1    Garlic clove
 
  Crush the garlic and mix all ingredients together. Add meat (steak)
  and leave for at least 1 hour, the longer the better.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple and quite superb meat marinade -- This is a truly
  wonderful marinade.  Just take the steak out of the freezer in the
  morning before you go to work and pop it in the marinade. Yield: 1
  serving .
  
  *  The recipe calls for 1 clove of garlic, but we often use 2 or
  more. Be careful with the Soy Sauce, if it is too salty the marinade
  is not so good. This basic mixture can be varied infinitely;
  particularly, you can use more marinade than this for one piece of
  meat. I like to use sesame oil, or mustard oil for a little "bite"
  instead of a bland vegetable oil.

           Yellow curry paste
 
  SOURCE: -- W. Siebeck: Ich kochte -- das Dinner for One
  
  Clean chicken and cut into 8 or more parts. In a dutch oven, bring to

  hours. Skim off foam. Remove skin and bones from chicken parts;
  transfer meat to a large soup bowl. De-fat the chicken broth Slice
  the onions thinly and fry in the ghee until golden brown. Add to the
  chicken in the soup bowl. Blend curry paste with a little broth, then
  stir into the remaining broth; bring to a boil. Pour hot soup over
  onions and chicken in the bowl. The amount of curry paste should be
  adapted to your taste, but in general the soup should be fairly hot.
  Indian-style curry-paste is best, but any Thai-style paste will do as
  well.

  The simple stir-frying of mushrooms and peas with curry paste and
  yogurt makes an incredibly good dish, garnished with that typically
  Indian herb, coriander. Serve with basmati rice and some poppadams
  and it is a feast.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pan and stir in the curry paste and the
  onion. Fry gently until soft. Add the mushrooms, turn the heat up a
  little and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the peas and mix well. Add
  salt to taste and a little water. Gradually stir in the yogurt and
  mix well. Simmer over a gentle heat until the sauce thickens and the
  mushrooms and peas are well cooked. Stir in the chopped coriander and
  it is ready to serve.

      Title: SIMPLE ORANGE MUFFINS
 Categories: Breads, Vegetarian
      Yield: 12 Muffins
 
      1 lg Orange
      1 oz Tofu
    3/4 c  Sugar; (less if desired)
      3 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Water or orange juice
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Cream of tartar
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Finely grate the zest from the orange.  Squeeze out and strain the
  orange's juice.  Set zest and juice aside.
  
  In a bowl, thoroughly mash the tofu with the sugar, or blend together
  with an electric mixer.  Mix in the finely grated orange zest and
  juice from the orange, oil, and water (or additional orange juice).
  
  In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, cream of
  tartar and salt.  Blend in the orange juice mixture. Spoon batter
  into muffin pans, filling each cup about 2/3 full. Bake for about 15
  minutes, or until muffins are starting to brown very lightly, and
  toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
  
  Karen's notes:  I always use tofu as an egg-replacer in baked goods,
  with excellent results.  It may only be luck, or coincidence, so if
  you don't have a piece of tofu handy, try omitting it.
  
  These muffins are pretty sweet, so you may want to decrease the
  amount of sugar used.  The sugar does seem to act as a humectant
  though, so the muffins will stay a little moister in storage if you
  use more sugar.

      Title: SIMPLE PASTA SAUCE BY SUZANNE
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ts Olive oil
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
    1/2 c  White wine
    1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
      1    Chopped tomato
        x  Fresh ground pepper
        x  Basil
 
  In a sauce pan that has heated for a minute, add 1 tsp olive oil and 1
  clove garlic, crushed.  Cook until the garlic just turns brown.
  [optional]
  
  Add (or start out with):  1/2 cup white wine and cook until it is
  reduced by half. (Most of the alcohol is gone by this point, but
  there is still good flavor.) Add 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice and one
  chopped tomato and cook for two minutes more.
  
  It is really simple and leaves a lot of flavor for the pasta. I also
  like to add fresh ground pepper and basil, You should experiment with
  the spices you like. I don't think they take away too much from the
  flavor of the pasta.  I hope you try it!

  Marinade:  In a bowl, combine all the ingredients. Gently toss the

  Child "The Way To Cook" - Page 99 To Coat Food in Bread Crumbs:
  
  "A coating of fresh white bread crumbs and a saute of real butter
  make a delicious salmon steak or chicken breast, or can give a bland
  fish or meat an interesting new dimension. In addition, crumbing
  gives more solidity to fish otherwise too flimsy or foods otherwsie
  to soft for a regualr saute. . .Fresh crumbs and real butter make all
  the difference". Crumbing the food: "Wisk together the eggs, oil and
  salt in a 9-inch pie plate. One at a time, dip first in flour and
  shake off excess, then in beaten egg and shake of excess.  Set in the
  crumbs, tossing them over the food and patting them in place.  Lay
  each piece as done on a baking sheet covered with wax paper; when all
  re crumbed, cover and refrigerate 20 minutes or longer, so the crumbs
  will set".

  This is so simple there are really no rules on how much of any of the
  ingredients you need. Just adjust to your own taste. Cook the rice in
  your normal manner, but add a little soy sauce to the water. (I
  prefer a few dashes of hot sauce) Dice the onion and cabbage and fry
  in a small amount of oil. Add the brown sugar, garlic and margarine.
  Stir this around for a while and then add it to the cooked rice.

      Title: SIMPLE SALMON FILLETS
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Salmon; fillets are best
      1    Lemon
      1 ts Dill; dried or better, fresh
           Salt
           Pepper; white
      2 tb Mayonaise
 
  Hopefully you selected 2 nice fillets. Preheat the oven to 400F.
  Place the fillets skin side down in a baking dish (I use glass).
  Squeeze the lemon over and lightly sprinkle with salt and some white
  pepper.
   Then spread the dill over the fillets and let set for fifteen
  minutes--if you have the time!  Spread the Mayo evenly over the
  entire surface and cut end(s) of the fillets (just like spreading
  peanut butter).
   Place on a high shelf in the oven (just under the broiler element).
  Bake for 10 to 15 minutes for each inch of thickness. Then kick the
  broiler in for a few minutes, just until you see some browning of the
  mayo. * This technique will give you delicious, moist salmon every
  time--just don't overdo the cooking!  The broiler bit isn't
  mandatory, it just gives a nice finish.  If you skip the broiler then
  just add a few minutes to the baking time.

 Categories: Pasta, Sauces
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Unsalted butter
      1 sm White onion, thinly sliced
           Crosswise
      3 tb Water
      1 lb Plum Tomatoes, thinly sliced
           Lengthwise or

           And chopped
           Salt
      8    Fresh Basil leaves torn into
           Pieces
 
  In a large frying pan over medium heat,  melt the butter. Add the
  onion and the water, cover and cook gently stirring occasionally,
  until tender and completely translucent, about 10 minutes.  (Adding
  water and covering the pan helps keep the onion from burning.)
  
  Add the tomatoes, cover partially and cook over low heat until a
  creamy consistency is achieved, about 20 minutes (How long this takes
  will depend on how much water the tomatoes contain.) If the sauce
  begins to dry to much before the creamy state is achieved, add a few
  tablespoons water to the pan.
  
  Add salt to taste and the basil and stir well.  Remove from the heat
  and let stand, covered, for a few minutes so the basil can release
  its aroma.

 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Cook white beans
           Tomatoes, finely chopped
           Canned mild or green
           Chilies
           Canned hot jalapeno chilies
           Onion, finely chopped
           Diced red bell pepper, fresh
           Or roasted
        x  Whatever else seems good to
           You (my husband opted for
           Olives)
 
  Fill a big bowl with BAKED TOSTITOS.  Provide everyone with a butter
  knife to spread the beans onto the chips, and add toppings as
  desired. If you feel Nachos must have cheese, then you have to spread
  beans on each chip, arrange them on a cookie sheet and sprinkle the
  other ingredients, including shredded FF cheese, over them. Bake at
  350 just till cheese is melted.  But try it the other way first.
  Very tasty, everyone gets the toppings they prefer, and the chips
  stay CRISP!

      Title: SIMPLEST ROAST CHICKEN
 Categories: Miamiherald, Meat/poul
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Chicken (5-6lb); wing tips
           -removed
      1    Lemon; halved
      4    Whole garlic cloves
           Kosher salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 c  Chicken broth, water, fruit
           -juice or wine
 
  Place oven rack on second level from bottom.  Heat oven to 500
  degrees F. Remve the fat from the tail and crop end of the chicken.
  Discard the neck and giblets or freeze for making chicken stock
  later. Reserve chicken livers for another use. Stuff the cavity of
  the chicken with the lemon, garlic and butter(if using). Season the
  cavity and skin with salt and pepper. Place chicken in a 12-by-8-by-1
  1/2-inch roasting pan, breast side up. Put in oven legs first and
  roast 50 -60 minutes, or until juices run clear. After the first 10
  minutes, move the chicken with a wooden spatula to keep it from
  sticking. Remove the chicken to a platter by placing a large wooden
  spoon into the tail and balancing the chicken with a kitchen spoon
  pressed against the crop end.  As you lift the chicken, tilt it over
  the roasting pan so that all the juices run out of the cavity and
  into the pan. Pour off excess fat from the pan and put the pan on top
  of the stove. Add the stock or other liquid and bring to a boil,
  scraping the bottom vigorously with a wooden spoon. Let reduce by
  half. Serve the sauce over the chicken or, for crisp skin, in a sauce
  boat.

 Categories: Chinese, Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      6    Skeins dried shrimp noodles
    1/2 c  Dried shrimp
      1    Egg
      1 ts Water
    1/2 lb Barbecued pork
      2    Stalks celery
      2 c  Bean sprouts, blanched
      1    Medium yellow onion
      1    Green bell pepper
      1    Medium firm tomato
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 ts Fresh ginger, minced
      1 tb Curry powder
      4 tb Peanut oil

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Stock
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Chili oil
 
  Noodles:  Rinse shrimp noodles.  Boil noodles in water until cooked
  but still firm.  These thin noodles only take about 3 minutes to
  reach this stage.  Drain, reserving boiling water, & rinse with cold
  water until noodles are cooled & will not stick together.  Place in
  oiled bowl, refrigerate until firm.  The noodles must be firm before
  frying. Can be prepared day before.
  
  Preparation:  Wash & soak dried shrimp for 30 minutes; cut into thin
  pieces. Combine egg & water; cook as very thin omelet; cool; slice
  into 2" long shreds. Thinly slice pork to match. Blanch bean sprouts
  in noodle water (this water will have other uses, so hold onto it).
  Peel strings off celery stalks, thinly slice. Peel & halve onions,
  slice thinly. Core pepper, slice thinly in 2" lengths. Slice tomato
  in thin wedges. OR: slice these vegetables to match size of bean
  sprouts for better looking dish (a good shredder does this job
  quickly). Mix sauce ingredients in bowl.
  
  Stir-fry:  Add 1/2 of peanut oil to hot wok.  When oil begins to
  smoke, toss in garlic, ginger, shrimp & vegetables, except tomato;
  stir-fry on high heat for 2 minutes. Add sauce, & continue cooking
  until sauce reduces by half. Remove to holding bowl.
  
  Rinse wok; return to high heat; when it is dry, reduce heat to medium
  & add remaining peanut oil.  Heat oil to moderate (don`t let it
  smoke); add curry powder, stirring to mix with oil. Avoid burning
  curry; if it burns, start over.  Cook curry powder for about 30
  seconds. Add noodles a fist-full at a time, breaking noodles into
  short pieces. Toss noodles to coat & heat them. When hot, add cooked
  shrimp & vegetables; toss together to mix. Turn off heat. Add pork,
  egg shreds & tomato wedges; mix together. Serve. By the time dish is
  on the table, tomatoes will be hot, but still firm.

  In this popular Cantonese teahouse specialty, the rice noodles are
  permeated with an aromatic infusion of curry spices and herbs,
  seasonings borrowed from Indian and Malay cooking-- both cuisines are
  indigenous to Singapore.
  
  Cover mushrooms with warm water. When soft and pliable, remove and
  squeeze dry. Cut off and discard stems. Cut caps into thin slices.
  
  Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles; using chopsticks,
  stir and loosen noodles. When soft and pliable, about 30 seconds,
  drain them into a colander. Cover and let cool.
  
  Preheat wok until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, 1 slice of the
  ginger, the chicken, shrimp and pork; stir-fry until shrimp and
  chicken feel firm to the touch, about 1 minute. Remove and set aside.
  Pick out and discard ginger.
  
  To hot wok add remaining oil, ginger and salt, crushing ginger against
  sides of wok. When oil is hot, toss in onions, celery, snow peas,
  mushrooms, bell pepper and green onion; stir- fry until tender and
  crisp (1 to 2 minutes). Push vegetables to side of wok. Add curry
  powder to center of wok and lightly saute for 10 seconds. Then add
  sugar, soy sauce and chicken stock. Mix.
  
  Add noodles; combine,with vegetables by using chopsticks, to lift,
  shake and separate strands of noodles, until they are evenly coated
  with sauce, moist but not wet and begin to cling to each other. (Add
  more chicken stock if noodles seem too dry). Return meat mix mixture,
  taste for seasoning. Toss to heat through.

  until paper thin.  Spoon 1 tbls. mixture into each wrapper, fold and

       Again some expanation... these can be made with much thicker
  wrappers (the ones the street vendors sell are more like 1/2 to 1
  inch thick) and the filling can be just about anything. I have done
  these with leftover meat and a few vegetables ... such as mushrooms,
  celery etc.

      Title: SIOUX BERRY SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Native amer
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Chuck steak, boned/trimmed
      3 tb Peanut oil
      1 md White onion, peeled/sliced
      2 c  Beef stock (up to 3 cups)
      1 c  Blackberries
      1 tb Honey
           Salt to taste
 
  Broil the chuck steak in the oven until brown on both sides. In the
  old days this would have been done over the fire, so you might wish
  to quickly barbeque the meat in order to increase the flavor. Set the
  meat aside to cool.
  
  In a Dutch oven heat the oil and brown the onions. Cut the meat into
  bite-size pieces and add to the pot. Add the blackberries and enough
  beef stock to barely cover the meat. Stir in the honey and simmer the
  meat, covered, until it is very tender, about 1 hour. If the berries
  are too tart add more honey to taste. Add salt and serve in bowls.
  
  Smith recommends servings this with Bacon Corn Bread and Hominy Baked

  Mince the onions and garlic. Put the oysters in hot water until the

  sausage. Chop the oysters fine. Drain the grease off of the sausage.
  Add the onions, garlic, oysters and giblets to the sausage. Cook
  about 15 minutes.
  
  Soak the bread or croutons in the oyster water and mash it. Add the

  add Polish sausage to the meat, for some additional flavor. (Also, I
  almost always put a little hot sauce in the stuff for flavor.)

  fat in the meat). Mix the meat with the bbq sauce and the cavander's
  spice. Divide the meat into 4 portions and shape into balls. Make a
  depression in the center of each ball, deep enough to hold 1 Tb of
  the cheese and 1 tsp of the onion. Smooth the meat over the top of
  the cheese, re-forming into an elongated ball shape. A little trick
  is to wet your hands to smooth the meat, as you want to be sure the
  cheese is well contained in the ball and will not seep out during
  cooking. Place the meat on a rack over a roasting pan, in order to
  let any fat drain off. Cook the meat in a 375 degree oven for 45
  minutes to 1 hour. To serve: Place one cleaned leaf of the lettuce on
  each plate, and top it with the meat. garnish with the tomatoes. I
  like to stick the tomatoes with a toothpick, and push them into the
  meat, and I also sometimes put a few parsley or cilantro sprigs on
  the plate. It is easier to stay on a weight loss campaign if the food
  looks appetizing.

      1    Green onion stalk;chop fine
      1 pk Wonton skins or
           -1 recipe egg noodle dough*
 
   *Recipe is included in this collection. PREPARATION: Mix all
  ingredients except wonton skins. WRAPPING: Trim off 4 corners of
  wonton skins to form circles.
   Drop 1 tsp. mixture onto middle of the skin, gather up skin sides,
  letting the dough pleat naturally. Flatten top and give the middle a
  light squeeze while tapping the bottom on a flat surface so it will
  stand upright.
   STEAMING: Arrange dumplings in an 8 inch round cake pan. Set pan on
  the steam rack in the wok. Fill bottom of wok with water. Cover.
  Steam for 15-20 minutes.
   Serve hot with a sesame oil and soy sauce dip. (1 part sesame oil to
  2 parts light soy sauce.) DO AHEAD NOTES: Steam dumplings. Cool and
  freeze. Reheat by steaming again for 12-15 minutes. COMMENTS: Insert
  toothpicks for easy serving. If you use a bamboo or aluminum steamer,
  place dumplings directly on the rack without the cake pan. Steam for
  the same amount of time. Since steamed dumplings can be made ahead
  and reheated in great quantities they make marvelous hors d'oeuvres
  for large cocktail parties. The two-tier aluminum steamer works
  particularly well. Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted for

      2 ts Vanilla Extract -- (pure)
      2 tb Vinegar
 
  Preheat oven to 375.
  
  Sift together flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and sugar into an
  ungreased 8-inch square or 9-inch round cake pan. In a 2-cup
  measuring cup, measure and mix together the oil, water or coffee, and
  vanilla. Pour the liquid ingredients into the baking pan and mix the
  batter with a fork or small whisk.  When the batter is smooth, add
  the vinegar and stir in quickly. There will be pale swirls in the
  batter where the vinegar is reacting with the baking soda.  Stir just
  until the vinegar is evenly distributed throughout the batter. Bake
  for 25 to 30 minutes.

  To top the cake, I pureed a bag of (thawed) frozen raspberries and
  added a few drops of lemon juice, then strained through a seive. I
  was going to sprinkle some powdered sugar on top, but I realized I
  didn't have any *yikes*, so i just mixed in a little regular sugar. I
  spooned a little of this on top of each piece of cake (as well as
  underneath it), and then sprinkled fresh raspberries on top.  It was
  wonderful. The color of the pureed raspberries alone is enough to
  make me love this dessert. The cake was great too-- wonderfully dark
  and moist. A perfect contrast to the tartness of the berries.

  minutes. Stir in the chickpea flour and fenugreek and cook, stirring
  until the chickpea flour becomes a paste and browns slightly, 2 to 3
  minutes more. Pour in 2 cups of warm water and bring to a boil, over
  moderately high heat. Cook, stirring, until the gravy begins to
  thicken, about 1 minute. Add 2 more cups of water and bring to a
  boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the gravy reduces and
  thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chiles, ginger,
  ground coriander, tumeric, brown sugar, and salt and cook for 5
  minutes longer, stirring gently. Drain the vegetables and add them to
  the gravy.  Stir in the tomatoes and bay leaves, cover and cook until
  the vegetables are tender but not mushy, about 20 to 30 minutes. (If
  making this dish ahead, under cook the vegetables slightly.
  Refrigerated the dish for up to 2 days.  When re-heating the mixture,
  add 1/2 cup of water and bring to a simmer over moderate heat before
  proceeding.) Stir in the tamarind mixture and the fresh coriander and
  cook, uncovered for 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaves and serve.
  
  NOTE:
  
  Serve with cooling fresh Pineapple for those that do not like the
  heat.

  At least 3 hours before grilling the meat, trim it to remove all fat
  and gristle. For skirt steak, use a flat metal pounder to tenderize.
  {This is needed because of the short marinading time.} Put the meat
  in a shallow glass dish or plastic bag. Combine the marinade
  ingredients. Marinate for about 3 hours in refrigerator.
  
  About 45 minutes before serving, clean the grill surface and rub it
  with an oil dampened cloth. Preheat the grill for about 30 minutes.
  Remove the meat from the marinade. Sprinkle the meat and salt and
  pepper and place it on the grill. Baste with marinade, grill, then
  turn, baste again and grill until medium rare, about 5-6 minutes in
  all, or until desired doneness. Remove, cover with foil and keep warm.
  
  Heat 2 TBSP oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
  onions and cook until browned, but still crisp. Remove and add bell
  peppers. Saute about 2 minutes and add onions. Remove the skillet
  from the heat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Wrap the tortillas or pita breads
  in foil and heat until warm, 8-10 minutes. {Or zap 'em in a microwave
  for 15 to 25 seconds per tortilla, depending on your microwaves
  strength. Or grill 'em on the coals for a few seconds, or in another
  cast iron skillet for a few seconds.}
  
  Cut the beef across the grain into strips about 1/4 inch thick.
  Reserve all the juices. Put the skillet back on high heat long enough
  to get hot, then add the meat. It will sizzle. Turn immediately, then
  put the onions and peppers on top. Pour the reserved juices on top to
  create a sizzle. (For an even more dramatic sizzle, you can drizzle
  the meat and onions with 2 TBSP oil instead of the reserved juices.)
  Carry the skillet immediately to the table. Squeeze lime juice on
  top. To serve, use tortillas to enclose meat strips, peppers, onions,
  pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Shredded Smithfield ham
      4 sm Cakes Chinese bean curd
           -cubed, rinsed in cold water
      6 lg Chinese black mushrooms
           - soaked, squeezed dry
           - and shredded
      4 c  Peanut oil for deep-frying

MMMMM-------------------------RICE CRUST------------------------------
           Rice
           Oil, peanut

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Chopped scallions
           Sesame oil
 
  BRING THE BROTH TO A SIMMER in a pot and add the ham, bean curd and
  mushrooms. Let it simmer 5 minutes. Heat the oil in a wok to very hot
  (about 380F). Test the oil by dropping a small piece of Rice Crust
  into it. It should float immediately. Slip the whole Rice Crust into
  the oil. As it begins to puff up like popcorn, break it up into large
  chunks with long chopsticks. Turn it to brown on all sides (about 1
  minute). Remove the rice and drain it. At the table, add the rice to
  the serving bowl of soup. It will sizzle as the steam rises and
  provide quite a show. Add the scallions and sesame oil just before
  serving. (The oil used for deep-frying can be cooled, strained
  through a fine sieve and stored in a jar for future use.)
  
  FOR RICE CRUST: Prepare rice as you normally would, but cook it in a
  wide, heavy pot at least 15 minutes after the rice is soft so that a
  crust forms on the bottom of the pot. Spoon off the top layer of
  loose rice and set aside for Fried Rice or freeze it for future use.
  If left to stand overnight at room temperature, the crust will be
  easier to remove from the pot. To use the rice right away, keep the
  pot on low heat and dribble peanut oil around the edge. Heat for a
  few minutes, then loosen the crust with a spatula. It should come out
  in one whole piece. Invert the crust onto a plate. It can now be
  frozen for future use or used while still hot.

      Title: SIZZLING RICE SOUP #2 (CHICKEN)
 Categories: Soups, Oriental, Poultry, Rice, Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Long grain rice
      1 c  Water
      1    Whole chicken breast
      3 tb Cornstarch
      3 tb Water
      1 tb Soy sauce
      6 c  Chicken stock
      2 c  Shredded watercress, OR
      2 c  Lettuce OR spinach, shredded
    1/2 c  Finely chopped green onions
      1 ts Dark sesame oil (opt)
           Salad oil for deep frying
 
  Preparation: Skin, bone and cut the chicken breast into julienne
  strips.
  
  Rice: In a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, combine rice and water
  over high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium and
  cook 10 minutes. Drop heat to low and cook for an additional 30
  minutes without removing the lid. The crusty rice around the sides
  and bottom will stick to the pan. This will be used in the soup. Take
  off the top layer of softer rice and reserve for another use. Lift
  out the crusty rice and place on a cookie sheet to dry at room
  temperature, or place in a glass baking dish in a microwave oven for
  10 minutes on low. If the rice is dried at room temperature, allow
  12-24 hours before deep frying.
  
  Soup: Toss the strips of chicken breast with 1 tablespoon of the
  cornstarch. Set aside. In a small container, combine remaining 2
  tablespoons of cornstarch with water and soy sauce. Heat stock just to
  boiling. Stir in soy mixture and chicken. Simmer 5 minutes. Add the
  shredded greens, onions and sesame oil, if desired. Keep the soup hot
  (but not boiling) while frying rice. Heat oil to 375 degrees in a
  deep-fryer or heavy saucepan. Fry rice 3 to 5 minutes until puffed
  and lightly browned. Be watchful, because it can burn quickly. Lift
  rice out of the fat with a slotted spoon. Drain the rice on paper
  towls and place in a heated tureen or individual bowls. Pour in the
  soup. Serve at once. Additional fried rice may be passed during the
  course.

      2    Green onions; chopped
      2 ts Chili paste with garlic
      1    Cucumber; peeled
           -cut into 1/2" thick pieces
      1 tb Red wine vinegar
      1 ts Sesame oil
 
  PAT DRY THE SCALLOPS. In a bowl, toss scallops with the marinade; set
  aside for 30 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the chicken stock, soy
  sauce, rice wine, sugar and cornstarch; set aside. Preheat the wok
  over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and half the
  salt. Add dry scallops to the hot oil, stir-fry for about 1 minute.
  When the scallops begin to feel firm to the touch, remove from the
  wok; set aside. Reheat the wok. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Add the ginger,
  garlic, remaining salt, green onions, and chili paste; cook gently
  for 15 seconds. Turn heat to high; toss in cucumbers. Stir-fry for 30
  seconds. Add the sauce mixture and stir quickly to thicken. Return
  the scallops to the wok, add the vinegar and sesame oil; quickly toss
  for a few seconds to reheat. Place the cast iron platter on a burner
  over high heat for 5 to 10 minutes or place in a very hot oven.
  Sprinkle a few drops of water to test the heat. It should bubble and
  sizzle. Put a heatproof trivet on the dining table. Carefully place
  the hot sizzling platter on top of the trivet. As soon as the
  scallops are finished, transfer the scallops to a plate and quickly
  pour the mixture onto the hot platter and listen to it sizzle. Serve
  hot. Makes 4 servings as the main entree or up to 8 as part of a
  multicourse Chinese menu.

           -- (very thick),
           -- preferably halibut,
           -- turbot or monkfish
    1/4 lb Streaky bacon
    1/4 lb Mushrooms
      2 sm Onions (or more)
      8    Cherry tomatoes
      1    Lemon
           Oil

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE SAUCE----------------------------
      2 ts Honey
      1    Egg yolk
      1 tb (rounded) French mustard
  1 1/2 tb Tarragon vinegar
    1/4 pt Sunflower or safflower oil
 
      Cut the fish into large cubes, put it into a dish and sprinkle
  with lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Cut the onions into wedges, put
  them into a separate bowl with the mushrooms, add a good grinding of
  pepper, and oil and lemon juice - in the ratio of 2 tablespoons oil
  to 1 tablespoon lemon. Leave to absorb flavours for an hour or more.
  Halve the bacon rashers, de-rind them, stretch and roll them up
  loosely.
  
      The sauce can also be made in advance.  Beat the honey, mustard
  and egg yolk together in a small bowl. Add the vinegar, a spoonful at
  a time, whisking it in with a balloon whisk or fork. Then add the
  oil, pouring it from a jug in a thin stream and whisking the contents
  of the bowl all the time as you pour. Continue whisking for about a
  minute until the sauce is a homogeneous thick cream, then season to
  taste with salt and pepper.
  
      Close to serving time, thread the fish, onions and mushrooms on to
  skewers, adding the bacon rolls and tomatoes here and there. Grill
  for 10 minutes or so under medium-high heat, turning and basting
  occasionally with the marinade liquid.  Serve immediately with a dish
  of rice and hand round the sauce separately.

  Again, I got this recipe from the same Better Homes and Gardens "Easy
  Skillet Meals" cookbook, but I make the following changes:
  
  I use cream of celery soup, rather than the cream of mushroom, I use
  whole sliced mushrooms, red peppers or jalepenos (whichever I have on
  hand) and some diced onions and green peppers within the tortillas. I
  also use cheddar cheese instead of American and I tend to be a little
  generous on the cheese.  I also put refried beans inside too.
  
  Enjoy!

           Beat in a separate bowl:
      4    Egg yolks
           Add:
      1 tb Melted butter * I used oil *
      1 ts Vanilla
           Sift in separate bowl:
      1 c  Sugar
           Whip until stiff, but not
           -dry:
      4    Egg whites
 
  A Heavy 9 or 10 inch skillet * I used a 9 inch cake pan and melted the
  butter in the oven *
  
  Vary this recipe, which conventionally calls for canned pineapple, by
  using canned or frozen raspberries, peaches, or apricots. The last
  two require only 1/2 cup of sugar. Fresh fruit - peaches, cherries,
  apples, etc. - may require more than 1 cup, depending on the acidity
  of the fruit.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350. Melt in a skillet: Fold in the sugar, 1
  tablespoon at a time; then fold in the yolk mixture, and finally the
  sifted flour, 1/4 cup at a time. Bake the cake about 30 minutes.
  Immediately upon removal from the oven, reverse the cake on a serving
  plate. Allow the cake to remain over the cake to let the brown sugar
  mixture coat the cake. Remove the pan and serve upside down, after
  sprinkling the fruit with: (Brandy or rum) * I didn't do this, but
  yum yum yum! * The cake may be garnished with: (Whipped cream or a
  dessert sauce) *Good Heavens, why? * For individual servings, try
  this method:  Put butter, sugar and fruit in base of custard cups,
  run batter given above on

     19 oz Can chickpeas; drained and
           -rinsed
      2 tb Fresh parsley; chopped, for

  In a shallow dish, dredge chicken thighs in flour, shaking off the
  excess. Season both sides with salt and pepper. In a large cast-iron
  or nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat. Add
  the chicken, partially cover the pan and cook until the chicken is
  nicely browned, about 2 minutes per side (it will not be fully
  cooked). Remove from the skillet and set aside.
  
  Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to
  the skillet.  Add dried chile peppers and cook until they turn dark,
  about 2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and discard. Add onions
  and garlic to the skillet; cook until soft and lightly browned, 5 to
  7 minutes. Add paprika and marjoram and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
  Add tomatoes, green peppers and salt and pepper to taste; cook for 5
  minutes longer.
  
  Return the chicken to the skillet, along with 1/2 cup of the chicken
  broth. Cover and simmer until the chicken is tender and no longer
  pink inside, 20 to 25 minutes. Add chickpeas and the remaining 1/2
  cup broth; simmer for 5 to 8 minutes.  Blot off any fat that rises to
  the surface with paper towels.  Taste and adjust seasonings. (The
  dish can be made up to 2 days in advance and stored, covered in the
  refrigerator. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave oven

 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 oz Mushrooms (wild if possible)
      5 oz Good meat dripping
      2    Onions
      1 lb Medium oatmeal
           Salt and black pepper
 
  Skirlie is only worth making with good drippings from roasted meat.
  Chrissie remembers that sometimes the cook at the big house would
  dole out, to people who wanted it, the wonderful dripping that had
  been used for the umpteen big roasts.  I like skirlie as a kind of
  risotto, with wild chanterelles that grow in profusion all over the
  island. The mixture makes an excellent stuffing for a boned shoulder
  of lamb.
  
  Wipe and slice the mushrooms.  Skin and slice the onion thinly.
  
  Fry the mushrooms in 1 oz dripping in a wide frying pan. Remove them
  and reserve.  Heat the rest of the dripping. Fry the onion. When the
  onions are soft but not brown, turn up the heat.
  
  Add the oatmeal, turn it in the drippings and brown a bit. Throw in
  the mushrooms.  Add salt and black pepper to taste. Serve hot.

      Title: SKIRRET
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Skirret; sium sisarum
 
  Skirret is one of the many hardy perenniel vegetables which are
  typically grown as annuals. In Scotland it is known as crummock and
  in Germany as Zuckewurzel. A member of the carrot and parsley family,
  it is cultivated for the bunch of wrinkled, greyish roots that form
  from the crown. The roots have a sweet, tender white flesh which,
  when cooked like salsify or parsnips, is highly esteemed in oriental
  countries.
  
  To prepare skirret for table, simply scrub the roots and cut them into
  suitable lengths for cooking. They can be boiled with a bit of salt
  and served, like salsify or parsnips, with butter. The roots can be
  stewed, braised, baked, batter-fried, or creamed. They are also
  delicious when mashed with potatoes or served with a cheese sauce.
  Skirret can be grated or chopped and add to salads, or dressed in a
  vinegar marinade and served alone as salad. The flavor is described
  as very sweet and unusual, making this vegetable a fine ingredient in
  stews, curries and soups.

    370 ml Olive oil
      6    Black olives
      3    Lemon slices
           Sea salt to taste
           Pinch of parsley
 
  This makes enough Skordalia for several meals. Skordalia is a tasty
  side dish. It can also be used as a relish. Keep it refrigerated.
  
  Boil the unpeeled potatoes in water (salted if required, but not
  necessary).
  
  Crush the garlic into a mixing bowl. Peel the potatoes, and add them
  to the bowl whilst they are still hot.
  
  Add a pinch of salt. Mix the garlic and potato mixture to a pulp;
  using a food processor or mixer.
  
  Alternately, add the lemon juice and olive oil gradually, until all
  the ingredients are blended into a smooth mixture.
  
  Put the mixture into a bowl, garnish with parsley, olives and the
  slices of lemon.
  
  Notes:
  
  The amount of garlic can be varied according to taste; like this it
  has a strong flavour.
  
  Skordalia can be surved as a cold side dish, with vegetables.

 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/4 c  Sugar
      4 tb Cornstarch
      4 tb Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 c  Water
      4    Eggs, separated
      1 tb Grated lemon rind
      6 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Lemon extract
      4 oz Can toasted coconut chips
      1    Recipe plain pastry for 1  9
           -inch crust
 
  Prepare pastry recipe.  Roll out to a 12 " round on a lightly floured
  pastry cloth or board; fit into a 9" pie plate. Trim overhang to
  1/2"; turn under flush with rim & flute to make a stand-up edge;
  prick well all over with a fork.
  
  Bake in hot oven, 425, for 15 minutes or until golden; cool
  completely on a wire rack
  
  Mix 1-3/4 cups of the sugar, cornstarch, flour, and salt in a
  medium-size bowl.
  
  Heat water to boiling in a medium-size saucepan. Lower heat to medium;
  slowly add sugar mixture, stirring gently but constantly. Cook,
  stirring constantly, 5 to 7 minutes or until mixture holds a line
  when cut with a spoon; remove from heat at once. Do not let mixture
  boil.
  
  Beat egg yolks slightly in bowl; stir in 1/2 cup hot mixture; quickly
  stir back into mixture in saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly over
  medium heat, for 3 minutes or until mixture thickens. Remove from
  heat.
  
  Stir in lemon rind, juice, butter or margarine until blended. Pour
  into cool pastry shell.
  
  Beat egg whites with lemon extract until foamy, white and double in
  volume in bowl.  Sprinkle in 1/2 cup sugar, 1 Tbsp. at a time,
  beating all the time until sugar dissolves and meringue stands in
  firm peaks.
  
  Pile onto hot filling, spreading to edge of crust. This keeps
  meringue from shrinking.  Sprinkle with coconut chips, or place them
  in a pretty pattern on top.
  
  Bake in moderate oven, 350 F degrees, 12 minutes, or until peaks of
  meringue are a golden brown.  Cool completely on a wire rack before
  cutting

  the dough to a large, lightly oiled bowl, turn to coat and cover with
  plastic wrap,. Let rise until doubled in volume approximately 3

  dough into a 7-to 8-inch circle that is 1/4 inch thick. Using your
  hands or a semolina-dusted pizza peel, carefully transfer the
  prepared dough to the heated baking surface. Bake for 2 to 3 minutes,
  or until the breads have puffed. (Do not worry if all the breads do
  not puff completely; they will still taste delicious.) When baked,
  keep breads warm by stacking them and wrapping them in a clean

      3 c  Potatoes,mashed,cool,salted

  portions and roll out each portiom on floured board to 1/8 inch
  thickness in 8 inch circles. Pick surface with a fork to prevent
  puffing. Bake in preheated oven at 400 degrees. Bake on bottom
  surface of oven, (I use cookie sheets) for about 7 minutes on each
  side. After the Loska is baked, brush each side with either plain or
  browned butter. Stack on a plate and cut into wedges. Loska is good
  with any meatless soup.

 Categories: Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Ketchup
    1/2 c  Cider vinegar
      2 tb Hot sauce
      1 md Onion, grated
      3    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1    Rack of pork ribs, about 4
           -pounds
           This is a pretty typical US
           -BBQ treatment.
 
  Combine the ketchup, vinegar, hot sauce, onion, garlic and
  Worcestershire sauce in a mixing bowl and stir until blended. Pour
  half of the sauce into a glass baking dish large enough to hold the
  ribs in a single layer. Place the ribs meaty side down in the sauce.
  Pour remaining sauce over; cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.
  
  Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are thickly coated with ash. If
  you are using a gas grill, preheat on low for 5 minutes with the lid
  closed.
  
  Place the ribs on a rack set at least 6 inches from the fire. Grill
  slowly, for 15 minutes.  Turn and baste with sauce. Ribs should have
  browned slightly. If they still look raw, stoke the fire. If they
  have browned a great deal or scorched in spots, move ribs to a cooler
  part of the fire. Cook for 15 minutes, baste, and turn again. Grill
  for 30 to 45 minutes longer, turning and basting, every 5 minutes.
  Watch the fire carefully, keeping flames away from the ribs.
  
  To serve, slice the rack into individual ribs and pile on a heated
  platter.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: SLOW PORRIDGE
 Categories: Breakfast, Crockpot, Low-fat, Mcdougall
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      5 c  Water
      1 c  Oatmeal; * see note
    1/2 c  Dried fruit
      1 ds Ground nutmeg
      1 ds Ground mace
      1 ds Ground cinnamon
 
  Recipe by: McDougall Place water, cereal, and dried fruit in slow
  cooker. Stir. Cook on low for 8 - 10 hours. The mixture should be
  like a thick soup, so do not add milk at the table.
  
  HELPFUL HINTS: Each slow cooker is a little different from the
  others, so you may have to adjust the amount of water needed.
  
  For added flavor sprinkle a bit of nutmeg, mace or cinnamon, in any
  combination. Try brown rice, barley, rye berries, whole oats, or wheat
  berries. Cracked grains, such as oatmeal or cracked wheat, may get too
  mushy for some tastes. From the collection of Sue Smith, S.Smith34,

      Title: SLOW POTATOES
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6    12Medium good quality baking
           Potatoes
 
  Pre-heat oven to 300 deg. F. Thoroughly wash and clean potatoes, and
  remove any 'bad' spots. Pierce potatoes at least twice, and be sure
  to penetrate to the center or beyond. Place potatoes on top oven
  rack, about 3/4 way up. Bake for 4 hours. At the end of the baking
  time, remove potatoes from oven, place in a bowl, and refrigerate
  over night, or until completly cool/cold. Eat cold as a snack, but be
  sure to try the inside by itself, I find it very good, and eat the
  skin seperately.

  powder. Stir to combine - enough for 8 slices of bread. Curry is a
  nice flavor accompaniment with beef, chicken, lamb, shrimp and
  vegetables.
  
  Maple butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/2 tsp. maple flavoring.
  Stir to combine. Enough for 8 slices. Use maple butter for pockets.
  Use with pork, ham or sweets.
  
  Vanilla butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/2 tsp vanilla
  extract. Stir to combine - enough for 8 slices of bread. Vanilla
  butter enhances flavor and has an enticing aroma while cooking.
  
  Almond Butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/4 tsp almond extract.
  Stir to combine - enough for 8 slices bread. Use with fruit pie
  filling or other sweets.
  
  Herbed butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1/4 tsp herbs
  (combine basil, thyme, rosemary and tarragon). Stir to combine.
  Spread on one side of 8 bread slices or other bread products used for
  pockets. This taste especially good with meats, cheese and vegetables.
  
  Garlic butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1 clove garlic,
  crushed. Stir to combine.  Enough for 8 bread slices. Use with any
  eat or vegetable filling.
  
  Honey butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1 tblsp. honey. Stir
  to combine.  This is enough to spread 8 slices of bread. Because the
  honey promotes browning, use this on pockets which only have to brown
  and heat through.  If used on egg sandwiches,etc... the bread may
  over brown before the egg finishes cooking.
  
  Lemon butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; finely grated rind of
  1 lemon (about 1/2tsp.).  Stir to combine. This is enough to spread 8
  slices of bread. The fresh lemon brings out the flavor of fruit
  filling and seafood fillings.

  Fry the bacon, with the garlic, till it is lightly browned in a heavy
  bottomed casserole. Add birds and brown on all sides. Add the
  mushrooms and nuts, continue to cook for a couple of minutes, then
  add the ale and water with the bay leaves. Bring to the boil, cover
  and simmer very gently for 2 ~ 2 1/2 hours-- the birds should be
  falling off the bone. Remove the birds from the juices, cool juices
  completely and remove any excess fat. The birds can be served whole
  on or off the bone. If the latter, carve them while they are cold
  then return to the skimmed juices and reheat gently. Adjust the
  seasoning to taste and serve either the whole birds of the slices on
  the pieces of bread, with plenty of the juices and "bits". A good
  green salad to follow is the best accompaniment.

  Remove heads and tails from radishes; wash.  Using bottom of heavy
  drinking glass, about 2" across base, hit radishes on side to crack
  them - not mash them - so dressing can get into flesh. Avoid
  rendering a crushing blow no matter how you feel that day. Sprinkle
  radishes all over with salt, put them in a bowl, and set aside for
  about 15 minutes at room temperature. Prepare dressing:  Combine
  vinegar, sugar, thin soy sauce, peanut oil, sesame oil and fresh
  ginger juice. Double amount of vinegar for a sharper taste, if
  desired.  Drain liquid from radishes (salt will have drawn off quite
  a bit of water); pour dressing over them; cover and refrigerate for 3
  minutes.  If you make this dish ahead of time, pour on dressing 30
  minutes before serving.  Immediately before serving, transfer
  radishes to serving dish; garnish with Chinese parsley and serve.

    1/2 c  Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 qt Apple juice
      1 tb Rosemary

  Place turkey in brine for 8-12 hours.  Remove from brine. Rinse well
  and air dry.  Place turkey in the smoker with both upper and lower
  cavities open to expose the insides to smoke. Smoke 3-3 1/2 hours or
  longer being careful not to dry bird out.
  
  Remove turkey from the smoker and cook in your favorite way. If you
  desire more smoke flavor, simply increase smoking time and the amount
  of fuel used. Reduce your cooking time by 10% for each hour in the
  smoker (up to 40%).
  
  If you are using a smoker/barbeque/roaster type of barbeque, switch
  modes to roast mode and baste the turkey with honey during the
  roasting time.

      Title: SMOKED BEEF
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    2-4 lb lean beef roast
      1 tb Garlic Powder
      1 tb Onion Powder
      1 tb Black Pepper
      1 ts Chili Powder
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Paprika
      1 tb Cayenne Pepper
      1 ts Cumin
 
  * Use a covered Grill (Webber is the best.) or make a cover for your
  grill
    with aluminum foil and Clothes hangers. * Build two fires on each
  side of where the meat will be. * Place a drip pan (alumimum foil
  again) with water under where the meat
    will be. * Soak your smoking wood (preferably hickory) at least
  overnight.
  
  Mix the spices together to make a dry rub.   Rub the spice mixture on
  the trimmed beef roast and let marinate overnight in your icebox.
  When the fire has developed to ash covered, add the smoking wood and
  the meat, cover, and don't peek for at least 2 hours. Then add
  charcoal and smoke for another 2 hours. As always, adjust as
  necessary but the slower you smoke, the longer it will take and the
  more tender the meat will be. Submitted By KEN HAYCOOK

      Title: SMOKED BEEF ROAST & PORK ROAST
 Categories: Beef, Pork, Bbq/grill
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     20 lb Beef roast
     20    Garlic cloves - whole
           Pickled
     10    Green onions - whole
           WATER PAN SEASONINGS:
      1 c  Wine - dry, red or white
      2    Garlic cloves - whole
      1 ts Mint - dried
      6 dr Peychaud's bitters
           Water
     15 lb Pork roast
     20    Cayenne peppers - fresh or
      1    Onion - whole
      1 tb Liquid smoke
      2 tb Parsley
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
 
  Stick a knife into each roast in several places, making a deep
  puncture. With fingers, push 1 clove garlic in each hole, then a long
  pepper and a green onion. Slice the pepper and onion off even with
  the surface of the meat.  Sprinkle the roasts with salt and red
  pepper. When you get your fire going and are ready to put the meat on
  the smoker cooker, place some pre-soaked smoking wood (such as pecan
  or hickory) on the briquets. Place seasonings in water pan, then add
  water all the way to the top of the pan. Place beef roast, then pork
  roast, in cooker and let them cook. I usually put these on about 11
  P.M. and let them cook while I sleep. One 10-lb bag of charcoal will
  usually do.
  
  GRAVY 1/2 cup flour (for roux) 1/4 cup oil (for roux) cold water
  juice from smoker cooker
  
  After making a small roux, add enough cold water to blend roux. Then
  add as much juice from smoker cooker pan as you wish. It has all the
  juice and the tasty fat from the meat that was cooked. Simmer,
  stirring frequently, until gravy thickens slightly.  Serve over rice.

      Title: SMOKED CHICKEN & PEPPERONI GUMBO
 Categories: Cajun, Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -Spice mixture:
    1/4 ts White pepper
    1/4 ts Red pepper
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Thyme
      1 ts Dry parsley flakes
    1/2 ts Gumbo file powder
           -(optional)
           -Vegetables:
      2 c  Onion
      2 c  Green pepper
      2 c  Celery
           -meats:
      2    Smoked chicken breasts.
     12    Inches pepperoni.
           -broth:
      6 c  Chicken broth
 
  Prepare vegetables. Cut half in larger hunks (say 1/2 inch) and cut
  rest in fine chop (or use food processor).
  
  Meats: two smoked chicken breasts, pulled from bone, skinned and
  pulled into bite size pieces by hand.  If you do not have smoked
  chicken, you may get away with using a small amount of liquid smoke.
  I would guess no more than 1/4 teaspoon. one stick (about 12 inches)
  pepperoni, cut into moderately thick slices. (say 1/8 inch or about
  twice as thick as presliced pizza pepperoni usually is)
  
  Preparation: Using cast iron dutch oven, take the large cut onions and
  singe them over medium high heat in the dry pan for about 3-4 minutes,
  stirring constantly. Then add the rest of the vegetables and cook for
  about 5 minutes more on medium heat, stirring frequently. Then add
  spice mixture and stir to incorporate. Stir in about 2 tablespoon dry
  roux. Add the broth and the pepperoni slices. Turn heat down to
  medium low and simmer for at least 1/2 hour or until vegetables are
  tender and flavors are merged. About 5 minutes before serving, add
  the chunks of chicken breasts to the mixture. At the same time, add
  more roux to thicken if desired.
  
  Serve in bowl over lots of rice.
  
  For additional smoke flavor, wrap the chicken bones and skin in cheese
  cloth and place in the mixture at the same time as the pepperoni.
  Remove all the bones and all the skin before stirring in the chicken
  pieces.
  
  Makes 8 to 10 servings.

      Title: SMOKED FISH
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           SEE DIRECTIONS:
 
  Along the East coast where I live there's always an abundant supply of
  fresh fish. In the Spring there's fresh mackerel, and the Bluefish in
  the Fall, are my favorites for smoking.
  
  This recipe will work with Mackerel, Bluefish, Salmon, and even Cod.
  
  If you catch the fish yourself, cut through their throat to bleed them
  while they're still alive. Put them head down in a bucket so they'll
  pump out as much blood as possible. Wash and chill the whole fish
  until you can fillet them.
  
  Early in the morning of the day you're going to smoke wash 4 to 6
  fillets and place them in a brine made from: 1 quart cold water
      1/3    cup Kosher salt
      1/4    cup sugar 1 teaspoon black, red or other peppers (spices)
  to taste
  
  Mix this together in a glass or enamel bowl add the fish and submerge
  the fillets with a weight to hold them under the brine. Brine the
  fillets in the refrigerator from 2 to 4 hours (longer makes the fish
  saltier).
  
  Remove the fillets and wipe dry with paper towels. Place them, skin
  side down, on several thicknesses of dry paper towels and let them
  air dry for several hours. The surface is dry enough when your finger
  sticks to the flesh.
  
  Hot smoke over a 250 degree wood fire for about 2 hours or until the
  fillets are firm to the touch (like medium rare steak).
  
  Peel off the skin and enjoy.

 Categories: Salads, Appetizers, Seasonings
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 oz Smoked fish
     12 sl Baguette
    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
      2 tb White wine vinegar
      1    Shallot; finely diced
    1/4 c  Chopped dill
  1 1/2 ts Nonpareil capers
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 qt Mixed small lettuces
           -- cleaned and dried
           Pickled onions (optional)
 
  This composed salad-appetizer can be made with any kind of smoked
  fish. I like to include two types - salmon for its color and flavor
  and any kind that I have smoked or that is fresh-smoked from the
  market.
  
  Slice the fish very thin.  Toast the baguette slices until they are
  golden and crunchy and brush them lightly with olive oil while they
  are warm.
  
  Whisk the remaining olive oil into the vinegar in a small bowl. Add

 Categories: Appetizers, Mexican, Party foods, Shore house
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1 md Onion -- thinly sliced
      1 tb Golden brown sugar
    1/4 ts White wine vinegar
  1 1/2 c  Smoked Gouda cheese --

      4    10" flour tortilla
      2 oz Sliced prosciutto --
           Chopped
      2 tb Butter -- melted
 
  Melt 2 tablespoons butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add
  onion, brown sugar, and vinegar; saute until onion is golden brown,
  stirring frequently, about 25 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Cool to
  room temperature.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Sprinkle cheese over half of each
  tortilla, dividing equally.  Sprinkle prociutto and sauted onion over
  cheese. Season with pepper. Fold other half of tortilla over cheese
  mixture. Brush tortillas with some of melted butter.
  
  Brush heavy large skillet with some of the melted butter. Place over
  med-high heat.  Working in batches, cook quesadillas just until brown
  spots appear, brushing skillet with butter between batches, about 2
  minutes per side.  Transfer quesadillas to hevy large baking sheet.
  
  Bake until tortillas are golden and cheese melts about
        5    minutes.
  
  Transfer quesadillas to work surface.  Cut each into 6 triangles.
  Arrange on platter and serve hot.
  
  NOTE:  I sometimes speed up the process by placing prepared
  quesadillas directly under the broiler for a quick minute or so on
  each side.

      5 lb Hamburger
      5 ts Curing Salt***
  1 1/2 ts Garlic powder
  1 1/2 ts Onion powder
  2 1/2 tb Pepper, black, peppercorns

MMMMM-------------------------SALAMI #2------------------------------
      5 lb Hamburger
      5 ts Curing Salt***
      4 tb Wine, white, dry
  1 1/2 ts Garlic powder
  2 1/2 tb Chili powder
  1 1/4 ts Cumin, ground
      2 tb Sugar, brown

MMMMM-------------------------SALAMI #3------------------------------
      5 lb Hamburger
      5 ts Curing Salt***
      3 tb Wine, dry, red
  1 1/4 ts Garlic powder
  2 1/4 tb Mustard seed, whole
  1 1/2 tb Basil, ground
  1 1/2 tb Oregano, ground
    3/4 c  Parmesan cheese
      2 tb Sugar, brown
 
  Mix all ingredients thoroughly then cover and chill 24 hours or more.
  Divide into 4 portions.  Roll portions into 2 1/3"-3" diameter rolls
  and wrap with inexpensive large hole nylon net. Tie ends securely
  with string (net may be omitted, but rolls flatten out during
  smoking).
  
  Smoke in smoker for 8-12 hours with the fuel of your choice. This
  assumes a cold smoke.  Adjust times accordingly, but make sure salami
  is done throughout.
  
  Remove from smoker- remove netting and dry thoroughly with paper
  towel. Wrap in foil and refrigerate up to 3 weeks or freeze up to 6
  months. It is so easy to make you don't have to make large quantities
  and store.
  
  *** Curing Salt (VERY IMPORTANT) Use only 'Tender Quick' or prepared
  curing salt.  Regular salt does not have the flavors, taste or
  nitrate added to the quick cure and will not bind the meat required
  to make these recipes successful.  You may purchase prepared curing
  salts sold by Mortons, Lowery's and other companies. Check in your
  local supermarket near where they have the salt... Other sources
  would be butcher shops, wine stores and feed stores.

      2 sm Smoked mackerel
           -OR- smoked trout
  2 1/2 oz Chopped, toasted hazelnuts
           -OR- walnuts
      1 lb Seedless grapes
    1/2 lb Brown rice
           Fresh mint or watercress
      2    Lemons
           A little sunflower oil
    1/2 pt Creamy yoghurt (or more)
 
  Cook the rice in double its volume of fast boiling salted water.
  Refresh it and dress it with 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon
  oil and plenty of salt and pepper.  Stir in the nuts and 5-6
  tablespoons chopped mint or watercress.  (Watercress is good but mint
  is even better for this dish.) Press the mixture firmly into a
  lightly oiled ring mould, cover and chill for a couple of hours or
  more.
  
  Close to serving time, halve the grapes and toss them in the juice of
  half a lemon plus scant 1 tablespoon oil. Add some mint or watercress
  sprigs. Skin, bone and flake the fish and mix it in gently. Unmould
  the ring of rice, put some of the fish and grape mixture into the
  centre and garnish with sprigs of mint or watercress. Serve the rest
  of the fish mixture in a separate bowl, and hand round the
  well-chilled yoghurt in a second bowl.

      3 tb Butter
      2 tb Oil, preferably corn
      2 c  Corn kernels, fresh or

      1 ea Medium onion, chopped
    1/2 ea Medium green bell pepper
    1/2 ts White pepper
           Salt to taste
      1 c  Chicken stock
    1/4 c  Cream or half & half

      2 c  Dry cornbread crumbs or
           Other bread crumbs
      1 ea Egg white, beaten
           Fresh ground black pepper
           To taste
 
    Slice off the tops of the peppers about 1/2 inch down from the
  stems. Remove the seeds and cores from the peppers. If any won't
  stand upright, slice a little off the bottom, being careful not to
  cut into the pepper's cavity. Reserve the peppers and their tops.
  Melt the butter and oil in a medium skillet. Add the corn, onion, and
  green bell pepper and saute over medium heat until fragrant. Add the
  white pepper and salt. Cover the pan and cook for about 10 lminutes.
  Remove the lid, add the stock, cream, and hot sauce, and continue
  cooking, uncovered, until about half the liquid has evaporated.
  Remove the filling from the heat and mix in the cornbread crumbs and
  egg white. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the
  temperature up to 200 deg to 220 deg F. Grease a smokeproof baking
  dish that can hold the peppers snugly upright. Stuff each bell pepper
  with a portion of the filling. Replace the tops of the peppers and
  secure with toothpicks. Arrange the peppers in the prepared dish.
  Transfer the peppers to the smoker. Cook until they are tender but
  still hold their shape, 65 to 75 minutes. Remove the toothpicks and
  serve the peppers warm.

  Servings:  1
  
  SALMON STEAKS: Combine equal parts of butter and lemon and brush each
  steak on both sides with the mixture. Sprinkle with seasoned salt and
  dill. Serve with Cucumber Mayonnaise. Charcoal Smoker: Use 5 lbs.
  charcoal, 3 quarts hot water, 1 to 2 wood chunks and smoke 1 hour.
  Electric Smoker: Use 2 quarts hot water, 1 to 2 wood chunks and smoke
  1 hour. WHOLE SALMON: Brush salmon cavity with dill and seasoned
  salt. Repeat on the outside of the salmon.  Chill leftover salmon and
  serve with sour cream and dill or Yogurt Dill Sauce. Charcoal Smoker:
  Use 7 to 9 lbs. charcoal, 4 quarts hot water, 2 wood chunks and smoke
  3 to 5 hours, depending on size. Electric Smoker: Use 4 quarts hot
  water, 2 wood chunks and smoke 3 to 5 hours, depending on size.
  Yield: 1/3 lb. per person Note: This very expensive delicacy can be
  made easily and economically at home. Serve hot or cold with Cucumber
  Mayonnaise or Yogurt Dill Sauce. Another note: Frozen seafood should
  always be thawed before cooking. The most harm you can do to seafood
  is to overcook.  Seafood is done when the flesh turns white or
  opazue. The meat will flake easily when forked and shellfish will
  feel firm to the touch. If cooked in the shell, the shells will open
  when done. Seafood is most delicate and requires short cooking times.
  Fish with high fat content will require longer cooking. Recipe from
  "Cook'n Cajun Water Smoker Cookbook".

      Title: SMOKED SALMON & BRIE PIZZA
 Categories: Breads, Main dish, Kooknet, Cyberealm
      Yield: 2 Pies
 
           PIE: (makes 2 pies)
  4 1/4 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Water, lukewarm (105 to 115
           Degrees Fahrenheit)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      2 tb Olive oil
           TOPPING: (for one pie)
      1 lb Brie, rind discarded, cut
           Into small pieces
     12 oz Smoked salmon, cut into
           Small pieces
      1 sm Onion, red, very thinly
           Sliced, separated into rings
    1/4 c  Olive oil, extra virgin
 
  Put flour into a large bowl and make a deep well in the middle. Pour
  warm water into the well, mix in the yeast, using a bit of flour in
  the mix. Add the sugar, salt, and flour to the well, let stand for 10
  minutes until mixture bubbles. Slowly stir all of the flour into the
  yeast mixture. When it gets too thick to handle place it on a board
  and knead it until elastic. Form a ball, place into a greased bowl,
  then turn it over so the top of the ball is greased. Cover with a
  towel and let rise in a warm and draft free place for an hour or
  until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Punch down dough
  and divide in half. Refrigerate one half for later. (Allow extra time
  to rise). Roll the other half into a circle about 15 inches across.
  Place on a 14 inch greased pizza pan, roll edges to form a rim.
  
  Transfer the pie a pizza pan. Bake the pizza until the crust begins to
  brown, about 6 minutes. Remove from oven and cover with cheese,
  leaving 1/2 inch border around the edges. Arrange the salmon and
  onion on top and drizzle evenly with olive oil. Return to the oven
  and bake until the crust is golden brown and puffy, the cheese begins
  to melt and the salmon is heated thru, about 4 minutes. Remove from
  oven to a cutting tray or board and lightly brush the crust with
  olive oil. Garnish with dill. Slice and serve immediately.

  My dad did that for as long as I can remember.  Scott takes the idea
  one step farther, letting meat juice drip in. With Scott's method,
  you'll probably want to refrigerate it so the fat will harden and be
  easy to remove.
  
  What I do is make my sauce, but keep it a little on the thin side. I
  pour it into a pyrex dish, and set it off to the side on the smoker
  for the last few hours. You'll get a blackish film that forms on the
  surface. Just stir that in every half your or so, until you get the
  flavor you want. Much better than using liquid smoke.

      2 tb Dry mustard
      3    Carrots -- chopped
    1/2 c  Raspberry vinegar
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Ketchup
      2 c  Heavy whipping cream
      1    Red bell pepper
      1 c  Sour cream
           Salt and pepper -- to taste
      2 oz Sun-dried tomatoes -- soaked

           Fresh-squeezed
      1 tb Unsalted butter
           Salt and pepper -- to taste
 
  STEP ONE: Prepare the Barbecue Sauce-- Start a charcoal fire in
  outdoor grill. When coals are white-hot, cover with soaked wood
  chips. Place chipotle and serrano chiles, tomatoes, red onion, 3 red
  bell peppers, turnip, and garlic on grill and cover. Adjust dampers
  to reduce heat and smoke vegetables for about 20 minutes. (When
  vegetables are done, smoke shrimp for enchilada filling for about 15
  to 20 minutes.) Add vegetables to beef stock and reduce to 1 quart.
  Meanwhile, reduce brown sugar and raspberry vinegar to syrup
  consistency. Strain vegetables from stock and discard. Add carrots,
  mustard, and vinegar-sugar mixture to stock and simmer until carrots
  are done. Puree sauce in blender and strain. Return to heat, add
  ketchup, and reduce until sauce coats the back of a spoon. Add salt
  and pepper to taste.
  
  CHEF'S NOTE: Adjust amount of chiles for hotter sauce.
  
  STEP TWO: Prepare the Red Peppers-- Over an open flame, roast the red
  bell pepper until skin is charred black and begins to loosen from the
  pepper. Immediately immerse pepper in ice water. When cool, peel and
  seed pepper and place in blender with sour cream. Puree until smooth
  and add salt and pepper to taste. STEP THREE: Create Smoked Shrimp
  Enchiladas-- Saute sun-dried tomatoes, diced sweet onion, corn
  kernels, mushrooms, and green onions in butter until slightly soft.
  Add shrimp,cream and lime juice and reduce. Taste for salt and pepper.
  
  Place equal amounts of fillings in center of tortilla and roll the
  tortilla in a cylinder.
  
  Garnish each tortilla with a dollop of Red Pepper Cream and pour
  barbecue sauce around the enchilada.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Artichokes, fresh ones
           -have tight leaves
      2    Green onions, finely
           -chopped
      6 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Mushrooms, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      3 tb White wine
      3 tb Lemon juice
           Salt and pepper
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 c  Ham, cooked, finely chopped
      1 tb Parsley, chopped
 
      Trim tops and leaves of artichokes with scissors and cut stalks
  level with base.  (I would cut off the top third of the artichoke and
  cut off the tips of the leaves remaining to remove "spikes".) Put
  artichokes into a kettle of boiling salted water and simmer about 35
  to 40 minutes or until a leaf can be pulled out easily. Drain,
  refresh under cold running water, and let stand upside down until
  cool.
      To make the dressing:  Saute green onions slowly in 2 tablespoons
  of the oil, until just tender.  Stir in mushrooms and cook 2-3
  minutes; then stir in bread crumbs and cheese. Transfer mixture to a
  bowl and let stand until cool.  Stir in wine, lemon juice and
  remaining oil. Season well with garlic salt, salt and pepper, then
  add ham.
      Prepare each artichoke by pulling out some of the center leaves
  until the choke can be reached.  (I'd just cut off about the top
  third of the artichoke and the choke would be reachable.) With a
  teaspoon, scrape out all the hairy choke.  Fill each artichoke with
  dressing and top with parsley.  Wrap each artichoke in foil, leaving
  the top open. Place on smoker grid and smoke for 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

           Trout
           Lime, sliced
           Lemon, sliced
           Smoking wood
 
  * Smoking woods can be as varied as Mesquite, Apple, Alder, Hickory,
  or
    any other flavor you like. Soak the wood in water at least
  overnight. * You will need a covered grill, (Weber is the best.) * If
  you use a grill rather than a smoker prepare the charcoal in two
    piles on either side of the cooking area. * Light with a
  non-petroleum lighter, (electric, parafine based
    firestarters, or if you were a Scout, you can try the old two match
    method.) After all that the cooking is rather simple. In the cavity
  of each trout alternate slices of lemon and lime. Either oil the fish
  or the grill with as much oil it will handle. It will make taking the
  fish off eaiser. Place the fish in the middle of the charcoal fires.
  Put the soaked wood on the charcoal, close the lid (and do not open
  for at least 1 hr.), and wait. It will take at least 1 hr to cook and
  possible more depending on the number and size of the fish. Check it
  after the hour to see if it is flaky. If it is not done, serve some
  more appetizers and wait another hour. A good rule of thumb is: 1lb
  trout=1 hour, 2 or 2 lb trout=1 1/2 hour, 3 or 3 lb trout=2 hrs.,
  etc. Use any leftover in a salad with a spicy dressing. You will be
  amazed! Submitted By KEN HAYCOOK <KHAYCOOK@UNICOMP.NET> On THU, 22

      8    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18"

MMMMM--------------------SMOKED TROUT FILLING-------------------------
      2 pk Cream cheese, low-fat (8 oz)
    1/2 lb Trout fillets; smoked, skin
           --and pin bones removed
    1/3 c  Scallions; chopped (2 scall
      4 ts Horseradish; well drained
      1 c  Cucumber; shredded
 
      To make phyllo tartlet shells: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
  Lightly coat 2 mini-muffin pans with nonstick cooking spray. In a
  small bowl, whisk together egg white, oil and salt.
      Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface and with a pastry brush,
  lightly coat it with the egg-white mixture. Lay a second sheet
  smoothly on top, taking care to line up the edges before setting the
  sheet down. (Once you set down the sheet, it cannot be moved.) Brush
  with the egg-white mixture and repeat with 1 more sheet. Lay a fourth
  sheet on top but do not brush it.
      With a knife, cut the dough into 4 strips lenghtwise and 5 strips
  crosswise, making 24 squares. Press squares into muffin cups and bake
  for 8 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Transfer the
  tartlets to a rack and let cool. Repeat the procedure with the
  remaining 4 sheets of phyllo and egg-white mixture. (The baked
  tartlet shells may be stored in a closed container at room
  temperature for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months.)
  
       To make smoked trout filling: In a food processor, combine cream
  cheese and smoked trout; process until fairly smooth. Add scallions
  and horseradish and pulse until just combined. (Alternatively, finely
  mince the smoked trout with a knife and combine with the cream
  cheese, scallion and horseradish in a small bowl.) (The smoked
  filling may be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 2 days.) Shortly
  before serving, spoon or pipe about 1 heaping tsp. of filling into
  each tartlet shell and garnish with shredded cucumber.

      Title: SMOKED TURKEY
 Categories: Turkey, Smoker
      Yield: 1 Bird
 
      1    Method
 
  Basically what we do is remove the giblets and neck and wash the
  turkey thoroughly, inside and out.  I usually make a paste with salt,
  pepper, thyme (dried okay) and liquid smoke. Then I loosen the skin
  on the breast with my hands and try to get the paste rubbed over the
  breast as best I can.  I do the same thing to the outside of the
  turkey as well with the paste.  If you're not up to this, just salt,
  pepper and thyme the inside and out AFTER rubbing with liquid smoke.
  
  We put a quartered onion, a few stalks of celery and a bay leaf
  inside the turkey.  In the water pan we put some water, cheap white
  wine, a lemon cut in half, a quartered onion, a stalk of celery, a
  few bay leaves and some peppercorns.
  
  We soak our wood blocks (the chips don't seem to give it the flavor we
  like) at least an hour before starting. We use a lot of the hickory
  blocks during the smoking process, adding them every couple hours
  when we check the liquid in the water pan.
  
  We have a Weber smoker (no, not the Weber grill used as a smoker)
  which is pretty large and also a lot more air tight than our last
  smoker. It cooks a lot quicker than our old smoker. Brian has pretty
  much decided that he cooks them approximately 1/2 hour per pound,
  though we usually use the following method:  Pierce the dark meat
  with a fork and if the juice runs clear, it's time to take that baby
  off. If pink juice, leave it on. Another way that works is when it's
  done, the leg will move pretty easily. Just remember it continues to
  cook for a while when you take it off.
  
  We tried using the liquid from the water pan once and it was too
  strong in smoked flavor for our liking... MUCH too strong. Taste it
  before you use it, by all means.

    1/2 c  Finely diced celery
    1/2 c  Finely diced green or red
           -bell pepper
      1 ts Chile powder (New Mexico,

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Dried thyme, crumbled
    1/4 ts Dried oregano, crumbled
    1/8 ts Cayenne (optional)
      2 lb Assorted, shellfish *
      2 c  Cooked long-grain rice
 
  * small raw shrimp, peeled and deveined; cooked crab meat; small
  shucked oysters
  
  Place the carcass in a stock pot, breaking it up, if necessary, to
  make it fit.  Add water to cover.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a
  simmer, and skim off any foam that comes to the surface.
  
  Add the sliced onion, celery, parsley, thyme sprig and bay leaf;
  simmer, uncovered, skimming occasionally, for 2 to 4 hours. (The
  longer you cook it, the richer the stock will be.) Do not let the
  stock boil or it will turn cloudy.
  
  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet (preferably cast iron), over
  medium heat.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring and scraping the
  entire bottom of the pan at least every 10 seconds, until the
  resulting roux cooks to a deep mahogany color, 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  Adjust the heat to prevent scorching, which can give a bitter taste.
  Turn off the heat and continue stirring a minute or two until the
  mixture no longer gets darker on the bottom.
  
  Carefully stir in the diced vegetables tables; don't let the roux
  splatter it can cause nasty burns.  Stir to coat the vegetables
  evenly with roux; stir in the chile powder, salt, pepper, herbs and
  cayenne; set aside. (The roux may be prepared to this point while the
  stock cooks.) Strain the stock, let it stand until the fat rises to
  the top, and skim off the fat.
  
  Bring 8 cups of the stock to a boil in a large pot, stir in the roux
  vegetable mixture and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15
  minutes.
  
  Add the shrimp, crab and/or oysters and simmer just until done, about
  5 minutes.  Taste for seasoning and correct if necessary. Serve in
  soup bowls over small scoops of rice.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

      Title: SMOKER HONEY-GLAZED BREAST OF TURKEY
 Categories: Turkey, Smoker
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Turkey breast, bone-in
    1/2 c  Honey
    1/4 c  Sherry, dry
      1 tb Butter
    1/2    Lemon; juiced
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ds Liquid Smoke; (opt)
 
  Rinse turkey breast and pat dry.  Heat honey, sherry and butter in a
  saucepan.  Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice and salt (and the few
  drops of Liquid Smoke). Pour honey mixture (we recommend you cool the
  mixture thoroughly first) over turkey breast and let stand, covered,
  in refrigerator for 3 to 5 hours (we think overnight is much better,
  several days is okay, too, turning at least twice a day). Place
  turkey breast on smoker grid and baste.  Baste once again when almost
  done. See below for times:
  
  Charcoal Smoker:  Use 7 pounds charcoal, 4 quarts hot water (we make a
  portion of this white wine, and put in an onion, a few celery stalks,
  a lemon cut in half, a few cloves of garlic and a couple bay leaves),
  2 wood sticks (we use about 4 to 6 hickory blocks, soaked for at
  least an hour in water), and smoke 3 to 4 hours. (Stop about 1/2 hour
  early if you plan to reheat at a later time in the oven; we don't
  usually do this, but rather pour hot gravy over the sliced turkey if
  we want it warm.)
  
  Electric Smoker:  Use 4 quarts hot water (see recommendations for
  charcoal smoker for our suggestions), 2 wood sticks (ditto) and smoke
  2-1/2 to
    3-1/2    hours.

    450 g  Cold mashed potato
    175 g  Raw potato; grated
      1 ts Vegetable oil
     50 g  Bacon, preferably smoked

           Oil for frying
     10    Soft round rolls

MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
           Salad and relishes
 
  Drain the salmon and break fish into flakes. Set aside. Mix together
  the mashed and grated potato in a bowl. Heat the vegetable oil in a
  frying pan and fry the bacon until it is crisp. Add the bacon to the
  potato mixture along with the salmon, mixing well to break up the
  salmon.
  
  Divide the mixture into 10 or 12 pieces and shape each piece into a
  burger using hands or a burger maker. Fry the burgers gently for 5
  minutes on each side, or until they are well browned. (It is best to
  cook 3 or 4 burgers at one time or the pan will be too crowded to
  turn them over easily.)
  
  Keep the cooked burgers warm whilst preparing the rest, then serve in
  split rolls garnished with salad and relishes.

    1/2 c  Tomato sauce (omit if using
           Canned tomatoes which
           Already have lots of juice)
      1 c  Apple juice
 
  1) Mix spices in a small bowl. 2) Combine 1 cup of chopped onion, 1
  cup finely chopped eggplant, 1 cup of okra (I put in a food processor
  and pulse to chop finely) 3) Heat non-stick skillet or pot over high
  heat about 4 minutes. Add chopped vegetables, bell pepper and
  seasoning mix, stir and cook for about 5 minutes. Vegetables should
  stick to bottom of pan, then you unstick and stir them so that they
  carmelize (brown) a little but don't burn. 4) Stir in 1 cup of apple
  juice, stir to unstick from bottom, add 1 cup of tomatoes. Cook,
  stirring occasionally until most of liquid evaporates, about 20
  minutes. 5) Add remaining onions, okra, eggplant and tomatoes (tomato
  sauce if used). Scrape to clear bottom and cook 10 minutes or more
  until eggplant is cooked.
  
  Notes --- This is from Paul Prudhomme's Fork in the Road. I used to be
  warry of okra, but in Oklahoma in the heat of August it's about the
  only vegetable that still grows (even the tomatoes stop setting fruit
  when it gets too hot).  I also used frozen okra.  I like the okra in
  this recipe. When well cooked, the gumminess goes away and its serves
  as a thickener to the dish.  If you're warry of okra, you might want
  to reduce the total amount to 1 cup and let the eggplant and tomotoes
  dominate. Prudhomme always uses onion powder and garlic powder in his
  spice mixes, which I used to think was redundant when using real
  onions, but it actually imparts a different flavor. He places great
  emphasis on cooking the vegetables a long time in a non-stick skillet
  and letting them brown a little to carmelize and develop the flavors,
  and it does pay to be patient. The original recipe had a total of 2
  1/2 cups of apple juice, but that seemed like too much to me and I
  already had plenty of liquid from the canned tomatoes.

 Categories: Creole, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Rich beef broth
        pn Sage leaves, crumbled
      6    Thick loin pork chops
      1 c  Flour for dredging
           Salt and pepper, to taste
    1/2 c  Lard
      3 lg Onions, sliced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/4 c  Celery, minced
 
  We get recipes for Seoul food here but not many for soul food. A big
  lack, I think as I love the stuff. The following four recipes are
  from the California Culinary Academy over in the city and comprise a
  soul food dinner.
  
  No matter where they're served, smothered meat dishes are extremely
  popular (and remarkably similar) throughout the South: chops heaped
  high with sauteed onions and a spicy brown gravy. This
  Mississippi/Louisiana recipe borrows several New Orleans Creole
  techniques.
  
  1.  In a small saucepan melt butter over medium-high heat, stir in
  the 2 tablespoons flour, and cook, stirring constantly with a wire
  whisk, until lightly browned. Stir in broth and sage, mix well,
  remove from heat, and set aside.  This mixture will be the sauce.
  
  2.  Add salt and pepper to the 1 cup flour; dredge chops in the
  mixture. In a large, heavy skillet heat 1/4 cup of the lard over
  medium- high heat. Add chops and cook until they are browned. Move
  browned chops to a large, oven proof casserole with a cover. Preheat
  oven to 350F.
  
  3.  Melt the remaining lard in skillet over high heat. Add onions,
  garlic, and celery; lower heat to medium, and cook, stirring
  frequently to avoid burning, until onions are golden (about 8 to 10
  minutes). Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and place over chops
  in the casserole.
  
  4.  Pour off all lard from the skillet.  Add reserved sauce, raise
  heat to high, bring to a boil, and cook for 1 minute, stirring
  vigorously and scraping the bottom of the skillet. Pour sauce over
  chops in casserole, cover, and bake for 30 minutes.  Serve with
  mashed potatoes.
  
  Serves 6.

      3 tb Vegetable oil [used FF

      2    Medium-size onions, cut in
           Half and thinly sliced
      1    Scant t sweet Hungarian
           Paprika
      6 lg Red peppers, cored, seeded,

           Strips
      3    Canned Italian plum
           Tomatoes, drained and finely
           Chopped
      2 ts Tomato paste
    1/3 c  Chicken broth, or more if
           Needed [used FF chicken
           Broth]
        x  Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper, to taste
  1 1/2 tb Red wine vinegar
    1/8 ts Sugar, or more to taste
 
  1) Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions
  and saute' until softened but not colored, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in
  the paprika and toss with the onions until they are deeply colored.
  
  2) Add the peppers and continue to saute', stirring occasionally, for
  another 10 minutes. Do not allow the vegetables to brown.
  
  3) Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, broth, and salt and pepper.
  Allow the mixture to boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer the
  peppers until very tender, about 30 to 35 minutes, adding more
  liquid, a little at a time, if it evaporates.
  
  4) Off the heat, stir in the vinegar and sugar and allow the mixture
  to cool.
  
  5) This can be served warm, at room temperature, or cold.
  
  Serves 4 [as a side dish]
  
  [Variation: Use roasted red peppers instead of fresh. You'll probably
  find this requires less cooking time, and requires more sugar to take
  the edge off the roasted red peppers and prevent them from dominating
  the dish. - Curtis]

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
        3 c  basmati rice -- long grain
        2 ts salt
    5 1/2 c  water
        2 TB olive oil
  
  This is the simplest way of cooking Persian rice. 1. Pick over and
  wash 3 cups of rice 5 times in warm water.
  
  2. Place rice, salt, and water in a deep non-stick pot. Bring to a
  boil over high heat, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes
  over medium heat (do not cover the rice). Gently stir the rice with a
  wooden spoon a few times while it boils.
  
  3. When the rice has absorbed all the water, pour the oil over it and
  stir through gently with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat.
  
  4. Place a clean dish towel or 2 layers of paper towel over the pot
  and cover firmly with the lid on to prevent steam from escaping. Cook
  40 minutes over low bleat. Remove the potfrom heat and allow to cool
  for 5 minutes on a damp surface without uncovering.
  
  5. Gently taking one skimmer or spatula full of rice at a time,
  without disturbing the bottom crust, place the rice on a serving
  platter. Mound rice in shape of a cone.
  
  6. Detach the crust from the bottom of the pot using a wooden spatula.
  Place on a small platter and serve.

      Title: SMOTHERED ROUND STEAK
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Round steak
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
      1 ts Ground red pepper
      1 ts Ground white pepper
      1 x  All-purpose flour (dredging)
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      3 ea Medium onions, chopped
      2 ea Bell peppers, chopped
      1 ea Celery rib, chopped
      1 c  Beef stock or water
 
  Alex Patout says, "Smothering is a multipurpose Cajun technique that
  works wonders with everything from game to snap beans. It's similar
  to what the rest of the world knows as braising--the ingredients are
  briefly browned or sauteed, then cooked with a little liquid over a
  low heat for a long time." Season the roast with one half of the salt
  and peppers. Dust with flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch
  oven or other large heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the steak,
  and brown well on all sides. Remove the meat and pour off all but 1
  teaspoon of the oil. Add half the onions, bell peppers, celery, and
  the other half of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well
  and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point. Return the roast to
  the pot and cover with the remaining vegetables. Cover and let cook
  until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Serve the
  meat in slices, with rice alongside and the gravy over all. When you
  try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be sure to adjust the
  cooking times accordingly--let tenderness be your guide. For extra
  flavorful roasts, try larding with slivers of garlic before
  smothering. Serves 4-6 From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home Cooking" Random

      Title: SMLTSILL (MELTED HERRING)
 Categories: Swedish, Seafood
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 qt Water
      1 ts Salt
      4 md Boiling potatoes; peeled
      2    Fillets of canned Matjes
           -herring
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Parsley; finely chopped
      3    Radishes; finely chopped or
           -thinly sliced
      2    Hard-cooked eggs; whites and
           -yolks chopped separately
 
  Bring the water and salt to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan, add the
  potatoes and cook uncovered. Select a heatproof plate the same
  diameter as the pot to serve as a lid. Lay the herring fillets on the
  plate side by side and make neat, diagonal slices through them every
  1/2" without disturbing their original shape. When the potatoes are
  about half-cooked (after 10 minutes or so, but test now and then with
  the tip of a small, sharp knife), cover the pot with the plate of
  sliced herring and continue cooking the potatoes over medium heat for
  another 10 to 12 minutes or until potatoes are tender and the herring
  is heated through or "melted." Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of
  butter in a small saucepan. Cook slowly over moderately low heat to
  brown the butter lightly. Drain potatoes, return to pan and dry over
  low heat for a minute or two, shaking constantly. Place the herring
  on a serving plate and garnish with chopped parsley, radishs and egg
  whites and yolks. Pour the hot butter on the herring only and serve
  the potatoes in a separate bowl.

      Title: SM KTTBULLAR (SMALL SWEDISH MEATBALLS)
 Categories: Swedish, Meats, Appetizers, Main dish
      Yield: 50 Meatballs
 
      1 tb Butter
      4 tb Onion; finely chopped
      1 lg Potato; bioled, mashed (1 c)
      3 tb Bread crumbs; fine dry
      1 lb Ground beef; lean
    1/3 c  Cream; heavy
      1 ts Salt
      1    Egg
      1 tb Parsley; fine chopped (opt)
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Vegetable oil

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 tb Flour
    3/4 c  Cream; light or heavy
 
  In a small frying pan, melt 1 tb. of butter over moderate heat. When
  the foam subsides, add the onions and cook for about 5 minutes, until
  they are soft and translucent but not brown. In a large bowl, combine
  the onions, mashed potato, bread crumbs, meat cream, salt, egg and
  optional parsley. Knead vigorously with both hands or beat with a
  wooden spoon until all of the ingredients are well blended and the
  mixture is smooth and fluffy. Shape into small balls about 1" in
  diameter. Arrange the meatballs in one layer on a baking sheet or flt
  tray, cover with plastic and chill for at least 1 hour before
  cooking. Over high heat, melt 2 tb. butter and 2 tb. oil in a heavy
  skillet. When the foam subsides, add the meatballs, 8 to 10 at a
  time. Reduce the heat to moderate and fry the balls on all sides,
  shaking the pan almost constantly to roll them around in the hot fat
  to help keep their shape. In 8 to 10 minutes the meatballs should be
  brown outside and show no trace of pink inside when one is broken
  open with a knife. Add more butter and oil to the skillet as needed
  and transfer each finished batch to a casserole or baking dish and
  keep warm in a 200øF. oven. If the meatballs are to be served as a
  main course with noodles or potatoes, you may want to make a sauce
  with the pan juices. Remove from the heat, pour off all fat from the
  pan and stir in 1 tb. of flour. Quickly stir in 3/4 cup cream (light
  or heavy) and boil over moderate heat for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring
  constantly, until it is thick and smooth. Pour over meatballs and
  serve. If the meatballs are to be served as an hors d'oeuvre or as
  part of a smrgsbord, they should be cooked as above, but formed
  into smaller balls and served without the sauce. Serves 6 to 8 or
  about 50 meatballs.

      Title: SNAILS~ CRETAN STYLE~ W/ VINEGAR OR TOMATOES
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias

MMMMM---------------------TO PREPARE SNAILS--------------------------
           Wheat, flour and/or thyme
           Salt

MMMMM----------------FOR FIRST RECIPE, TO SERVE 1---------------------
      1 lb Snails
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar

MMMMM----------------FOR SECOND RECIPE, SERVING 1---------------------
      1 lb Snails
    1/2 c  Olive oil
           Salt
      1    Onion; grated
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1 lb Peeled, chopped tomatoes
 
  The Greek gift for having a word for it applies richly to snails,
  usually called "salingaria" on the mainland, but "hohli" on Crete and
  "karaoli" on Cyprus.  Hohli are a favorite Cretan food, and the
  delicious cooking methods explain why.  Snails are scrupulously
  avoided except in summer, when they are considered safe to eat. Since
  snails absorb the odors and taste of foods on which they feed,
  Cretans catch them after a rainfall, put them in a covered container,
  and feed them for several days on wheat, flour, and perhaps some
  thyme.  Then the real fun begins. The amounts of the other
  ingredients in this recipe are based on a pound of snails. One pound
  of snails serves 1 or 2.
      First be sure all the snails are alive, then wash them thoroughly
  in cold water and place in their shells in a container large enough
  to hold them.  Pour hot water over them to cover and bring to a boil.
  Add a teaspoon of salt for each quart of water and continue to boil
  for 20 minutes, skimming off foam. Drain the snails, then wash in
  cold water and drain again. In a deep, heavy pan, heat olive oil
  almost to the boiling point, using 1/2 cup olive oil per pound of
  snails. Add the snails and fry for 10 minutes, turning carefully with
  tongs to avoid spattering oil. Pour in 1/4 cup red wine vinegar for
  each pound of snails. Remove from heat and stir constantly for a few
  minutes. Remove the snails to individual plates and serve hot with a
  little of the remaining sauce, and some bread and wine, as an
  appetizer or first course.
  
  SNAILS BRAISED WITH TOMATOES Prepare the snails for cooking as
  directed above.  In a deep, heavy pan, heat 1/2 cup olive oil per
  pound of snails, add some salt for seasoning and then the snails.
  Cover, lower the heat, and cook for 10 minutes, turning once. Add a
  grated onion and 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley per pound of snails.
  Stir over medium heat for a few minutes, then add a pound of peeled,
  chopped tomatoes for each pound of snails. Cover and simmer for 30
  minutes, or until the tomatoes are tender. Serve with fried potatoes
  and baby zucchini salad.

      Title: SNAILS~ PORTUGUESE STYLE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Small snails
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Bunch dry oregano
      1    Laurel leaf
      1    Garlic clove, minced
      1 sm Onion, peeled, quartered
           Sal & pepper
           Piri-piri peppers
 
  Try to obtain snails about 1/2" diameter. Starve them for 3 or 4 days
  to get rid of any toxic herbs they may have ingested. Wash snails in
  running water till all the slime is gone. Place them in a large pan
  and cover with water (2" or 3" above snails). Add all the other
  ingredients. Cover the pan tightly.  Heat the water over a very slow
  fire so that snails have time to extend heads outside shells.
  
  Let boil slowly  for the first hour. Skim and simmer for another
  hour, Skim again and serve  warm in saucers, with a little of the
  cooking liquid. Use toothpicks or pins to extract snails from shell.
  Dip small pieces of bread in the cooking liquid. Refrigerates well -
  use any leftovers within a week. Suggested wines: Portuguese Vinho
  Verde, or a dry white wine.

      Title: SNAILS~ SICILIAN STYLE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Land snails
           Water
           Salt
      2    Cloves garlic finely chopped
    1/4 c  Olive oil
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
 
    Serves 6 to 8.
    1.  There is a small membrane, known as an operculum, at the
  opening of each snail.  Use a toothpick to remove this membrane and
  it will come off easily.   2.  Place the snails in a basin and rinse
  thoroughly with cold water.  Drain and rinse once more in cold water
  that contains a generous amount of salt.
   Rinse once more in cold water before cooking.
    3.  Add four quarts of cold water to a kettle and add the snails and
  about three tablespoons salt.
   Bring slowly to a boil and simmer six minutes, stirring
  occasionally. 4. Meanwhile, place the garlic and one teaspoon of salt
  in a small, heavy bowl.  Crush the garlic with a pestle or the back
  of a heavy spoon to make a paste.  Add the oil, pepper (to taste),
  lemon juice, and six tablespoons cold water.
   Stir with a whisk to blend.   5.  Drain the snails and serve hot
  with the sauce cold.   Note:  To eat the snails, pull out the meat
  with a pick and dip them one at a time in the sauce. The whole snail
  may be eaten, although the most fastidious prefer to skip the soft
  after end of the meat, which is the digestive tract.

           Sesame oil
           Chopped parsley or cilantro
 
  CUT ACROSS THE STEM END of the peas and pull off the string that runs
  along the length of the pea. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt
  and the peas. Blanch until the peas turn bright green and are
  tender-crisp, after a minute or so. Taste to make sure--the time will
  depend on the type of pea and how mature it is. Scoop them out with a
  strainer and shake off as much excess water as possible. Put them in
  a bowl and toss with just enough oil to lightly coat, a teaspoon or
  so. Add the parsley or cilantro and serve. For a variation, make the
  recipe using peanut oil or a fine olive oil tossed with basil rather
  than cilantro.

      Title: SNIPPETS OF VENISON
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Best venison trimmings
      2 fl Cider
      4 fl Good stock
      6 oz Cap mushrooms
      1 bn Chives
           Garlic
           Juniper
           Unsalted butter
      4 fl Soured cream or Greek yogurt
 
  Cut the meat into strips about the size of your thumb ~ if possible.
  Some of the trimmings may, of course, be slightly ragged, triangular
  or cubed but this is the size and shape to aim for. Dust with
  coarsely ground black pepper and 3 to 4 crushed juniper berries,
  moisten with the cider, cover and leave to marinate for 24 hours.
  Crush a garlic clove, mix it with the soured cream or yoghurt and
  leave it to infuse in a cool place for 24 hours.
  
  Carefully drain and dry the venison, reserving the marinade. Slice the
  mushrooms thickly and saute them in a little very hot butter. Remove
  and keep hot. Then saute the venison briefly, searing it nicely but
  keeping it succulent and pink within - 2 minutes is plenty. Then let
  the venison rest in a low oven where it will go on cooking a little
  without toughening. Start making the sauce straight away or wait for
  several minutes if you want the meat to lose its pinkness.
  
  To make the sauce, let the marinade liquid and the stock bubble away
  in the frying pan until reduced to just 2 or 3 spoonfuls. Blend in
  any juices that the venison has exuded and bubble again briefly. Then
  beat in the garlic-flavoured soured cream, away from the heat. Return
  the pan to a low flame to warm the sauce. Season well, scatter with
  chopped chives and serve on very hot plates.

      Title: SNOW DRIFTS
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 32 Nests
 
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
  3 1/2 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Boiling water
      2 tb Nonfat egg substitute,
           -equivalent to 1/2 egg
      1 ts Butter
  1 1/2 ts Grated lemon zest
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      6    Filo dough sheets, thawed
           -according to package
           -directions
           Butter-flavored, non-stick
           -cooking spray
           Powdered sugar
 
  The flaky texture of filo dough combined with a creamy lemon curd
  filling makes a great-tasting, low-fat dessert. Rather than using
  butter, spray the sheets of filo dough with butter-flavored,
  non-stick cooking spray to keep the fat content low. The lemon curd
  contains almost no fat. Only a small amount of nonfat egg substitute
  and one teaspoon of butter were added to the filling for flavor.
  
  Combine granulated sugar, cornstarch and salt in medium saucepan.
  Stir in boiling water until blended. Heat, stirring constantly, to
  boiling. Heat and stir until thickened and clear, about 1 minute. Add
  some hot cornstarch mixture to egg substitute, stirring until blended.
  
  Return all ingredients to saucepan. Heat and stir over low heat until
  slightly thickened, being careful not to curdle mixture. Stir in
  butter until melted. Stir in lemon zest and juice. Let cool to room
  temperature, then chill.
  
  Place one sheet of filo on cutting board. Spray evenly with
  butter-flavored cooking spray. Repeat layering with second and third
  sheets of filo dough. Cut stacked sheets into eight strips
  lengthwise. Cut strips in half crosswise to make 16. Arrange one
  strip of file sheets into each of 16 mini-muffin cups to form nest
  shape. Repeat with remaining three sheets filo dough.
  
  Bake at 350'F. 5-7 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire rack
  to cool.
  
  Dust filo cups with powdered sugar. Fill with lemon curd. Makes 32.

MMMMM----------------MY LAST MINUTE PANICKED TOPP---------------------
      1 pk Knox unflavored gelatin
    1/4 c  Cold water
      1 c  Boiling water
    2/3 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 c  Sour cream <16 ozs>
      8 oz Cool whip--thawed
      1 pk Danish dessert mix
 
  ~<junket>--raspberry ~flavored
    2 1/2 c  Cold water ~frozen box or bag of ~raspberries, thawed,
  juice ~reserved.
    2 1/2 c  Cold water <part raspberry ~juice>
      1/3 c  Sugar
        2 tb Tapioca
  
  Salad: Using wire whip, blend cold water with gelatin. Add boiling
  water and mix well. Whip in sugar and vanilla and mix well. Whip in
  sour cream and cool whip.  Pour into ring mold and refrigerate
  overnight.
  
  Several hours before you're ready to serve, make the topping.
  
  Mom's topping: Stir junket into cold liquid in pan--we use part of the
  raspberry juice to replace part of the water. Bring to boil, boil 1
  minute. Cool completely, but do not refrigerate. Just before serving,
  add raspberries, pour over unmolded salad, and serve extra sauce on
  the side.
  
  My Last-Minute Panicked Topping: stir sugar and tapioca into water and
  bring to boil. Boil 1 minute. Cool completely but do not refrigerate.
  Follow serving directions as above.
  
  Lisa's notes: this salad has a raspberry sauce.  My mom's recipes
  called for Danish Dessert <junket> raspberry flavored. My hubby and I
  went to 10+ grocery stores and there was none to be found. Finally my
  mom <who lives 4 hours away> called and read me the ingredient list
  and I made up my own sauce based on that. My husband thought my
  topping was even better than my mom's, so I'll stop hunting for the
  junket mix. People never want to try this <it sounds like a strange
  combination> but when we get them to, they really like it!

 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Cake yeast or
    1/4 oz Package dry yeast
    1/4 c  Water
      1 qt Buttermilk
      1 tb Baking soda
      4 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      4 c  Flour
      2 tb Baking powder
    1/4 c  Cooking oil
      6    Eggs -- well beaten
      1 c  Blueberries
 
  Preparation of these pancakes must begin the night before they are to
  be served. Soften yeast in warm water. (if using a yeast cake, water
  should be 80. Dry yeast has better results if the water is heated
  from 105 to 115.) In a separate container mix together buttermilk,
  baking soda, sugar and salt. Add to this the softened yeast. Sift
  flour and baking powder together and add, with the oil, to the
  buttermilk mixture. Mix well. Fold in the eggs. Place in refrigerator
  overnight in a container large enough to allow the batter to double
  in bulk.  In the morning add the blueberries to the dough and stir
  down. Cook in a fry pan over medium heat and serve. This recipe will
  keep in a refrigerator for a week or more. If black specks appear in
  the batter, just stir them in. They are just the yeast mold and do no
  harm.

      Title: SOAP~ PART 1 OF 2
 Categories: 
      Yield: 6 Pounds
 
      9 lb Suet (also called
           -tallow or beef fat)
      1 pk Lye (see note)
      3 c  Water
      2 c  Lemon juice
    1/4 oz Volatile fragrance
           -oil (optional; see note)
 
  TOOLS YOU WILL NEED:  1)  A large pot (metal or ceramic) -- at least 2
  gallons -- with a lid (for rendering the fat). 2) One long wooden
  spoon -- at least 10 inches -- that you can sacrifice, because the
  lye will eat away the wood. 3) A large ceramic (or glass) bowl
  capable of holding all the water, lemon juice and fat, with some room
  to spare. (I use a ceramic tub that is about 6 inches high and 24
  inches in diameter; do not use metal, as it will corrode. Even
  stainless steel will corrode.) 4) Finally, you will need some glass,
  ceramic and/or wooden molds to pour the soap into. (I use glass
  baking dishes; two 8 1/2 x 14-inch glass pans will make bars of soap
  that are about 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick. Again, DO NOT USE METAL
  CONTAINERS, as they will corrode.)
  
  STEP 1:  Render the fat.  To do this, cut the fat into hand-sized
  pieces and place in a large pot and cover it. Heat on medium until
  all the fat is melted.  You should stir it occasionally. You should
  probably plan to turn the fan on high or open your kitchen windows
  while you are doing this. (Note that if you are starting with a pure
  fat, such as coconut oil or olive oil, you don't need to do this.
  Skip to Step 4.)
  
  STEP 2:  Cool the fat so that it is below the boiling point of water.
  Add an equal volume of water to the fat, and bring the mixture to a
  boil. Cover and let cool over night.
  
  STEP 3:  Take the fat out of the pot.  I find the easiest way to do
  this is to slice the fat in half with a knife and then cut wedges.
  You can push the first wedge down into the water and then lift its
  neighboring wedge out. Scrape all the non-fat gunk off the bottom of
  the fat (the side of the fat that was at the fat-water interface).
  
  STEP 4:  Measure out about six pounds of rendered fat (be accurate
  with this measurement). Cut the fat into small pieces (about the size
  of a tennis ball, but squarish, not round) and place in a bowl.
  
  STEP 5:  Set up your soap-making work area.  It should be outside, in
  a very well-ventilated area. It's supposed to help to do it on a
  warmer day rather than a cooler day, but I've never noticed the
  difference. Also, clear your stove top and open the window in the
  kitchen before you start making the soap.
  
  On a table, put your ceramic tub, the bowl of fat, the opened
  container of lye, a container with the water, and a container with
  the lemon juice. If you will be adding scent, keep its container
  nearby. Also place your soap mold containers nearby. PUT ON ALL YOUR
  SAFETY GEAR.
  
  STEP 6:  Make the soap:  Pour the water into the ceramic tub. Very
  carefully pour the lye into the tub. This is an exothermic reaction:
  it gives off heat, which is used to melt the fat. It also gives off
  odors which you don't want to breathe, so keep your head back. Stir
  the lye to dissolve it in the water. Then start adding the fat to the
  water/lye mixture, stirring with the long wooden spoon. Add the fat a
  bit at a time and stir until it's all melted. Then stir in the lemon
  juice, scent (if you are using it), and pour into molds. When the
  soap is firmer but not yet hard, cut into bars with a knife. It
  should be hard in an hour or so; you can test it with your finger.
  
  STEP 7:  Wrap in clean cotton rags and store in a cool, airy place
  for 3-6 months.
  
  STEP 8:  When you clean up the pan that you made the soap it, be
  somewhat careful as there is probably still some unreacted lye in the
  pan. The only time I've had a problem with this is when I've tried to
  scrape the dry soap that lines the pan off with my fingernail and
  then a few minutes later I notice that the skin under my fingernail
  is burning. The easiest solution is just to wear gloves when you're
  cleaning the pan. It probably also helps to wash with extremely hot
  water so that the remaining soap (and fat if there is any) melts and
  dissolves in the water.

 Categories: 
      Yield: 6 Pounds
 
           See Part 1
 
  : Continued from Part 1
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  In the U.S., Red Devil lye comes in 12-oz containers. In Europe it
  generally comes in 350-g containers, which is about 3 percent more.
  You don't want to measure lye, you want to use the whole container.
  If your container is not this size, then scale the recipe up or down
  accordingly. Leftover lye is a serious disposal problem.
  
  *  Where to buy 9 pounds of fat? If you're using an animal fat (beef
  or pork), you can buy it from your butcher. What I find I have to do
  is reserve it, because they normally don't keep the fat after they've
  cut up their cow. Sometimes they will charge you for the fat (I've
  paid anywhere from 10 to 45 cents a pound); sometimes they won't.
  I've only ever made soap with beef fat; this makes a hard, mild,
  slow-lathering soap. The recipe will work equally well with other
  animal fats to produce a similar result.  Coconut oil yields a
  softer, quick-lathering soap. Olive oil and other vegetable cooking
  oils yield a very soft soap that never completely hardens.
  Unfortunately, these oils are sensitive to air and light, and soap
  made from cooking oils will spoil in a few weeks unless it is
  refrigerated.
  
  *  Volatile fragrance oils, also called essential oils, are highly
  concentrated scent ingredients.  You can usually buy them at
  health-food stores, and you can sometimes find exotic fragrances at
  specialty food-and-spice shops.  The amount that you should use
  depends on how fragrant you want the soap to be. A few drops of musk
  oil is enough to scent an entire batch of soap; less-potent
  fragrances such as a fruit oil might require about a teaspoon or two
  5-10 ml. Soap scented with herbs is also popular; herbs like lemon
  thyme or verbena or lavender work well. To scent with herbs, make an
  herbal oil by packing a 1/2-cup (approximately) container with herbs
  and then filling it with a pleasant-smelling vegetable oil, such as
  almond oil. Let this mixture sit for a few weeks, stirring it every
  day, then heat in a double boiler for 10 minutes, then cool and
  strain the oil.
  
  *  The soap works just fine with no fragrance at all, and many people
  prefer it that way. I certainly do.
  
  *  You may run into problems at the stage "Add the fat and stir until
  it's all melted." I almost always do. What happens is that the
  water/lye mixture runs out of heat before all the fat melts. What you
  have to do is add heat somehow.  The way I do this is to grab the tub
  (which now contains all the fat), go into the kitchen, put it on top
  of a burner, and turn the burner (and the fan) on high. (Make sure
  the windows are all open too.) When all the fat is melted, I go back
  outside and continue, adding the lemon juice.
  
  *  The lemon juice lowers the pH.  The finished soap will have a pH of
  about 9; you can lower this by adding more lemon juice.
  
  : Difficulty:  challenging.
  : Time:  Day 1:  30 minutes preparation; 1-2 hours cooking.
  : Day 2:  usually about 1 hour.
  : Precision:  Be precise.  Also be careful.

      2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 c  White flour
    1/2 c  Bran
    1/2 c  Wheat germ

      Title: SODA BREAD (IRISH WHISKY SODA)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 x  -----------bread------------
      4 c  Flour, all purpose
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 c  Butter, chilled
      1 c  Raisins or currants (option)
    1/2 c  Honey, liquid
    1/4 c  Irish whisky or buttermilk
      1 x  -----------glaze------------
      2 ts Irish whisky
      2 ea Ilk
 
  BREAD:  In large bowl, combine flour, salt and baking soda. With
  pastry blender or two knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles
  coarse crumbs. Stir in raisins or currants (if using). In separate
  bowl, combine buttermilk, honey and whisky.  Add all at once to dry
  ingredients; stir just until no dry spots remain. Turn dough out onto
  lightly floured surface. Knead lightly 1 minute (too much handling
  will toughen loaves, while too little will inhibit rising.)  Divide
  dough in half and shape each half into an 8 in (20 cm) round. Place
  in two greased 8 in (1.2 L) round cake pans. With floured knife, cut
  a cross 1/2 in deep in each loaf.
  GLAZE:  In small bowl, combine whisky and milk. Brush loaves with
  glaze. Bake in 350F (180C) oven 35 to 40 minutes or until loaves
  sound hollow when tapped on bottoms. Remove from pans; let cool on
  wire racks. Cut into wedges.

 Categories: Quick bread, Typed
      Yield: 50 Crackers
 
MMMMM-------------------AMERICAN MEASUREMENTS------------------------
      4 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Sour milk
      1 c  Butter
 
  From 1941, Soda Crackers Without Yeast. Because this is an old
  recipe, it's hard to determine how many crackers it makes. The yield
  will depend on how big you cut the squares. Preheat oven to 400
  degrees F. Sift flour, soda and salt together and cut in the butter.
  Add milk. The dough should be quite stiff.  Work it thoroughly for 10
  minutes. Roll out on a floured board to about 1/4-inch in thickness
  and cut in squares. Punch holes with fork. Place on greased pan and
  bake until golden, about 8 to 10 minutes.
  
  NOTE: To make sour milk, place 1 tablespoon vinegar in a cup, add
  milk to three fourth cup.

      Title: SODA PRETZELS
 Categories: Breads, Soda
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
 
  :          Dipping Solution
        5 c  Water
      1/3 c  Baking soda
  :          Dough-------------
    1 1/2 c  white flour
    1 1/2 c  whole wheat flour
        1 ts Baking soda
        4 tb Honey
        1 c  Buttermilk
  :          Course/Kosher salt
  
  This recipe for pretzels uses traditional Irish soda bread dought
  instead of a yeast based dough. It's quick and works great! The
  pretzels come out excellent--like the street vendor type.  I hope you
  enjoy...
  
  Combine water and soda in a non-aluminum pot (Corning works well).
  Heat to a boil or until all soda dissolves. Take off heat and set
  aside. This will be your dipping solution.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 deg F Sift flours and soda together and mix
  homogeneously. Add honey and slowly add buttermilk while working with
  hands until it is a firm dough. With a pin, roll dought into a flat
  sheet. Cut dough in long strips to make large pretzel twists, or cut
  into bite sized pieces (like I do!). Dip the prepared pieces of dough
  completely into the dipping solution. This will create the brown
  crunchy pretzel shell. Once dipped, place on an oven rack (if bite
  sized pieces are being made, cover the rack with aluminum foil and
  spray with PAM). Sprinkle with course salt if desired.
  
  Cook for 10 minutes of until dark brown on the second oven rack from
  the bottom.
  
  This method works great.  Pretzels are basically regular bread dough
  dipped in a baking soda solution before baking. The advantage to this
  method is that soda bread, a quick bread, has no yeast and does not
  require the time needed for rising before cooking. As soon as the
  dought is made, it is ready for the oven! Walt MM

      Title: SOESATIES
 Categories: Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Mutton fillet (leg)
      2 tb Butter or drippings
      2 lg Tablespoons chutney
      3    Onions (chopped)
      5    Or 6 lemon leaves
      1 tb Sugar
      1 c  Vinegar (or 1/2 milk)
      1 tb Curry powder
           Seasoning
           Corn flour
 
  Cut the meat into cubes of about 1 1/2 inches of fat and lean. Put
  into a basin and season with salt and pepper. Lightly brown the onion
  in the butter then add the curry powder, sugar, chutney and vinegar.
  Simmer for 5 minutes then pour the sauce over the meat, adding the
  lemon leaves. Leave in the sauce overnight, then arrange the meat on
  skewers, alternating the lean and the fat.  Drain out of the sauce
  and grill over a clear fire. Bring the sauce in which the meat was
  marinated to the boil and thicken with a little corn flour that has
  been mixed to a paste with cold water. Pour this over the soesaties
  and serve very hot with rice and additional chutney if desired.
  Soesaties may be fried, but in that case they should be cut into
  somewhat larger pieces and should not be placed on skewers. (If there
  is not sufficient fat on the mutton, extra should be used.)

      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      1 pk Regular or quick-acting

      1 c  Warm water (105 to115 degree
      1 tb Sugar

           Poppy seed or sesame seed,
           -If desired.
 
  *do not use self-rising flour in This recipe.
  
  The food processor method is terrific for those of us who bake
  frequently. Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Stir in
  sugar, salt, rosemary, oregano, 2 cups of the flour and the oil. Beat
  until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to
  handle (dough will be soft). Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.
  Knead about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.Place dough in greased
  medium bowl and turn greased side up. Cover and let rise in warm
  place 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until double. (Longer rising gives typical
  French bread texture.)Grease large cookie sheet and sprinkle with
  cornmeal. Divide dough into 24 equal parts. Roll and shape each part
  into rope, about 9 inches long, sprinkling with flour if dough is too
  sticky. Place on cookie sheet. Mix egg white and 2 tablespoons cold
  water. Brush over breadsticks. Sprinkle with poppy seed. Heat oven to
  400 degrees. Bake about 20 minutes or until crust is deep golden
  brown and crisp. Immediately remove from cookie sheets. Store loosely
  covered. 2 DOZEN BREADSTICKS; 65 CALORIES PER BREADSTICK Food
  Processor Directions: Place warm water and yeast in food processor.
  Cover and process, using quick on-and-off motions, until yeast is
  dissolved. Add flour, sugar and salt. Process about 30 seconds or
  until dough forms ball. (If dough is too sticky, add flour, 1
  tablespoon at a time.) Do not knead dough. Continue as directed.

       When you buy soft shell crabs, be sure they are still alive.
  Usually they look quite dead, weak and limp. Touch their legs, eyes,
  or mouth. Even if they respond only slightly and slowly, they are
  still alive. Refrigerate them as soon as you get home.
       Cleaning them is quite simple. Clip off the eyes and mouth. Lift
  the top shell and remove the soft feather-like gills and discard
  them. Turn the crab bottom up. Tear off and discard the cartlidge.

           Wok or deep, heavy saucepan
 
  Soft-shell crabs are in season from late spring through August. You
  should buy them alive and use the same day. (WP)
  
  1. Prepare the crab: Remove the lungs and tail and arrange the crab
  on a large platter.  Sprinkle with the minced jalapeno and the
  chopped cilantro. Pour the lime juice over and let marinate for at
  least 30 minutes, refrigerated.  When ready to cook, season lighlty
  with salt.
  
  2. Prepare the batter: In a small bowl, sift together the flour and
  baking powder.  Whisk in the water until the batter is smooth, then
  add the remaining ingredients, seasoning with cayenne and salt to
  taste. If made earlier in the day, set the bowl into an ice bath.
  
  3. At serving time, in a deep, heavy saucepan, wok, or deep-fat
  fryer, heat 3 inches of oil to 350 degrees.
  
  4. Dip each crab into the batter and coat well. Carefully place one
  or two in the hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
  Remove with a slotted spoon or a flat strainer and drain on paper or
  clean toweling. Keep warm while preparing the remaining crab and the
  spinach.
  
  5. Use the same oil to fry the spinach. Clean the spinach leaves
  well, trim and dry thoroughly.  Fry until crisp and translucent,
  about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on clean
  toweling. Season with salt to taste and serve immediately.
  
  Presentation: Arrange a few fried spinach leaves on half of each of 4
  plates.  Place 1 crab on the other half and serve immediately.
  
  To prepare ahead: Through step 2, the fish can be marinating, the
  batter ready. Have the spinach cleaned and ready. Heat the oil at
  serving time and continue with the recipe.
  
  Note: Shrimp can be substituted for the crab.  If using shrimp, peel,
  leaving the tail intact.

    1/2 ts Cumin seeds
    1/4 ts Celery seeds
    1/4 ts Crushed red pepper

      1 c  Creme fraiche
      1 c  Flour
      8    Soft-shell crabs; cleaned
 
  In a large nonreactive skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil
  over moderate heat for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and shallots and
  cook, stirring frequently, until the shallots are translucent and the
  garlic begins to brown, 5 to 6 minutes (don't let the garlic get too
  brown or it will be bitter).  Stir in the cumin and celery seeds, red
  pepper and 1/2 teaspoon each of the salt and black pepper. Cook for 1
  minute longer. Stir in the sugar and tomatoes and bring to a boil.
  Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer the sauce for 15

  refrigerate. Reheat before serving.) Preheat the oven to 250F.  On a
  plate, toss the flour with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon each of salt
  and black pepper. Pat the crabs dry with paper towels and dredge them
  in the seasoned flour. In a large skillet, preferably nonstick, heat
  2 tablespoons of the olive oil over moderately high heat. Add 4 of
  the crabs and cook, turning once, until red and crisp, about 3
  minutes per side. Transfer the crabs to a heatproof platter and place
  in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons
  olive oil and 4 crabs.  To serve, spoon the tomato sauce onto 4
  warmed plates and arrange 2 crabs on the sauce on each plate. Recipe

      Title: SOFT-SHELLED CICADAS
 Categories: Appetizers, Main dish, Insects
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     60    Freshly emerged 17 year
           Cicadas
      3 c  Flour
           Salt and pepper to season
           Flour
      4    Eggs, beaten
      1 c  Corn oil or slightly salted
           Butter
 
  The seventeen year cicada is considered a delicacy by nearly every
  living creature and when emerging, by the millions, stuff every
  animal for miles. Birds have trouble getting off the ground. Foxes
  waddle. Garter snakes are lumpy.  Dogs and cats curl up and sleep all
  day. In former times, the Native Americans found them to be a worthy
  addition to their diets when available.
  
  The cicadas emerge at night and hang like snow white Christmas
  ornaments from the trees.  As they dry, their color darkens to a
  black with orange decorative stripes. They are at their finest at
  night when they just emerge and are still soft.  They make great
  campfire cooking fare. For those who are interested, they are kosher!
  
  The best way to prepare them is to dip them, still alive, in beaten
  egg, roll them in the seasoned flour and then gently saute them until
  they are golden brown. They have a wonderful rich nutty flavor.
  Preparing them is simplicity itself.
  
  To find a supply of cicadas, call or write a local college or
  university department of entomology.  They can supply information as
  to which brood will be emerging in your area or near your area. They
  may be able to supply a general map and even specific dates when the
  emergence will occur. Here, in Indiana, we will have to wait until
  about Memorial Day weekend, 2002 A.D.  So you see, this is not a
  treat that you can just go out and pick up at Krogers.  It is worth
  the wait, even if it is just to say that you have done it!

      Title: SOLE STEAMED ON A BED OF CEYLON TEA
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Sole, flounder or fluke*
  1 1/2 tb Ceylon tea, loose
           Salt
    1/2 tb Unsalted butter
      2 sm Limes; peel/seed/dice
           Ceylon Tea Butter Sauce
 
  * Use 2 Dover sole, skinned and filleted to give 8 fillets; OR 4
  flounder fillets (6 to 7 ounces each), cut in half lengthwise along
  the center line of the fillet
  
  "Maniere imbued sole with the exotic woody scent of Ceylon tea by
  steaming the fish on a bed of the leaves. (Loose tea leaves will give
  more flavor than tea bags.) A rich, warmly colored butter sauce, made
  with a Ceylon tea-infused vinegar, completes the movement, and a
  garnish of a sparkling dice of lime cuts the righness of the sauce."
  
  Make the butter sauce; set aside in a warm place, and cover to keep
  warm.
  
  Cut a double layer of cheesecloth hat is twice as long as the steamer
  rack. Lay the cheesecloth on the steamer rack so that half of the
  cheesecloth covers the rack and the other half falls outside the
  steam. Sprinkle the tea over the cheesecloth in the steamer and fold
  the outer half of the cheesecloth over the tea to enclose it.
  
  Fold each fillet in half, skinned side in. Sprinkle with salt and
  place in a single layer on the cheesecloth on the steamer rack. Place
  over simmering water, cover, and steam until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
  
  Just before the fish is cooked, melt the butter in a frying pan over
  high heat. Add the lime and saute just to warm through, about 30
  seconds. Remove from the heat.
  
  To serve, divide the fillets among four plates. Sprinkle the lime
  over the fish and spoon the sauce over.
  
  Serve the fish with boiled potatoes or a simple rice pilaf; other
  vegetables muddy the delicate flavors of fish and sauce. If you have
  deep plates, spoon all of the sauce onto the plates so that the fish
  luxuriates in it. If not, spoon some sauce over each fillet and serve
  the rest in a sauceboat.

  Assembling: Rinse the dill and divide in half.  Scrub and rinse the
  horseradish and slice thinly.  Peel and halve the garlic.
  
  Fold half the dill into a ring to fit the bottom of the pickling jar.
  Strew horseradish, garlic, red pepper, and 1/3 of the tarragon on
  top. Arrange half the cucumbers upright in the jar, packing them
  tightly. Place the second third of the tarragon on top, then pack in
  the rest of the cucumbers in the same manner. Over them layer the
  remaining dill, horseradish, garlic, pepper and tarragon.
  
  Combine the salt and water, stirring until the salt dissolves.
  Percentage of salt in this brine is 5.5 to 6.5 percent. Pour the
  brine into the jar. The cucumbers and herbs should be fully
  submerged. Cover with a saucer and weight down with a jar or can
  filled with water. Cover the mouth of the jar with 2 layers of
  cheesecloth and tie in place with string.
  
  Fermentation and storage: For the first 2-3 days, keep the cucumbers
  on a well aired shaded patio or similar spot with a temperature of
  64-68 degrees.  Remove the scum as it appears and wash the mouth of
  the jar daily.  After 3-4 days, when the most active fermentation has
  subsided a bit, remove the weight and lid. Check to see that the
  brine still covers the cucumbers. If not, add brine in the same
  proportions (1 1/4-1 3/4 Tbsp salt to 1 pint water). Cover the jar
  with its own lid and refrigerate at 32-38 degrees.
  
  During the next 10-14 days, see that the brine does not become too
  cloudy (there is always some degree of cloudiness due to fermentation
  process) and that there is no mold. If either does happen, replace
  the brine, rinse the upper layer of dill, wipe the mouth of the jar
  and close again.
  
  Store the pickles on the lowest shelf of the refrigerator. They will
  keep for up to 1 week.

      2 md Onions, chopped
           Salt & Pepper to taste
      5 tb Flour, approximate
           Cooking Oil, as needed
      1 cn Whole Tomatoes, dice, 16oz
           -undrained
  5 1/2 oz Tomatoes Juice
      2 c  Hot Water, approximate
           Ground Nutmeg to taste
           Sugar to taste
 
  Crumble the ground beef into a skillet and brown with the onions. If
  beef is very lean, add a tablespoon or two of cooking oil. Salt and
  pepper to taste. Add flour a tablespoon at a time, stirring and
  cooking each spoonful, before adding the next. The flour must be
  cooked to preclude a starchy taste through out. Add enough flour to
  absorb the most of the oil.
  
  Stir in the tomatoes and the tomato juice, followed by the water.
  Allow to simmer on low heat to thicken. Adjust consistency as
  necessary. This recipe should be your basic meat sauce in a gravy of
  medium thickness.
  
  Add nutmeg, about 1/2 t, and perhaps sugar, 1/2 t, to adjust taste.
  In the NAVY this is served over toast at breakfast. It's also great
  on hot dogs!

  Hmm... I would replace the water with a nice malty beer. Paulaner
  Oktoberfest or Dos Equiis. And use a couple of chipotles in adobo
  instead of liquid smoke. They use the jock straps of the volunteer
  fire department to make that stuff.

      Title: SOO JEUNG KWA (PERSIMMON PUNCH)
 Categories: Fruit, Punch, Cold, Korean
      Yield: 1 Gallon
 
      1 ga ;water, cold
    1/4 lb Ginger, fresh; rinsed,
           -sliced thin with skin on
      2 oz Cinnamon sticks; 8-10
      2 c  Sugar; or to taste
      6    Whole semi-dried persimmons;
           -cut into 1" triangles
 
  1. Bring the water to a boil with the ginger and cinnamon sticks.
  Cook over moderate heat for 1/2 hour. Strain the liquid and discard
  the ginger but leave the cinnamon in the punch.
  
  2. Add the sugar while the liquid is still hot, to dissolve it. Add
  the persimmons to the lukewarm liquid and cool. The color of the
  punch becomes an old rose shade. Refrigerate the punch and serve cold.
  
  Serve whenever wanted with any Asian food.  Makes 1 gallon.
  
  NOTE: The Korean persimmon (Diospyros kaki) used in the punch is the
  large, orange, egg-shaped type. It is eaten when fully ripe -- very
  soft, orange-colored and with a creamy texture. In Korea, the unripe
  persimmons are picked in the autumn when the fruits are becoming
  ripe. The fruits are peeled and strung together but spaced like the
  lights on a Christmas tree. The strings of fruit are then attached to
  the persimmon tree to dry. Cool nights and warm days accelerate the
  drying, but during the week that it takes to dry, certain microbes
  that are floating freely in the garden air attach themselves to the
  peeled persimmons. After several days, the persimmons wilt and each
  one is then pushed together by hand to flatten on the drying string.
  When a white mold appears the fruit is dry enough to be packaged and
  sold, to be used in the punch. This procedure is a good illustration
  of the Korean ingenuity used in preserving their seasonal fruits and
  vegetables. It may also explain why dried persimmons are so expensive
  and uncommon.

      Title: SOONDAY (KOREAN STUFFED SAUSAGE)
 Categories: Sausage, Korean
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Yard small beef intestine
      2 c  Rice, cooked but still firm
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
      1 sl Fresh ginger, 1", crushed
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper; black or white
      1 tb Korean sesame oil
      1 ts Sesame seeds; crushed
      5    Scallions; chopped
      2 c  Beef or pork blood
 
  "In a number of cultures cooks stuff the small intestine of the cow,
  sheep or pig and boil, bake or roast it. In Tunisia, this is known as
  "merguez", in Eastern Europe as "kishke", in Indonesia, it is the
  spectacular "usus" in coconut milk. The "soonday" of Korea is
  entirely different.
  
  It originated in the cold climate of mountainous North Korea where the
  intestines of the wild mountain pigs were used. Now it's prepared all
  over the country and brought in large buckets to the public markets
  of Pusan, Kyongu, Seoul, Taegu and elsewhere. This sausage stuffing
  is made of rice, seasonings and beef or pork blood (or substitute 8
  ounces canned tomato puree).
  
  1. Clean the intestine as received from your butcher once again.
  Rinse well in cold water, then soak in lightly salted water for 1
  hour; this makes the intestine firm and easier to handle. Tie up one
  end firmly with cotton string.
  
  2. Prepare the stuffing. Mix the cooked rice, garlic, ginger, salt,
  pepper, sesame oil, sesame seeds, scallions and either blook or
  tomato puree. Loosely stuff the intestine either by machine or by a
  funnel ~- forcing the stuffing along the entire length. Do not fill
  too tightly since the intestine may split in cooking when the rice
  expands. Tie the open end firmly.
  
  The intestine may also be stuffed as individual sausages in which
  case it is cut into the desired lengths, tied, filled and tied again.
  
  3. Place the soonday in a large pan, curling it around like a snail.
  Cover it with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Then turn to
  low and cook uncovered for 3/4 hour. At the end of this time, insert
  a skewer in the soonday to test for doneness. As when testing a cake,
  if the skewer is dry and the soonday is firm to pressure, it is done.
  
  Cut diagonally into 1/4-inch thick slices and serve warm or at room
  temperature (warm is better). Serve on festive occasions especially
  after the harvest of rice, cabbage (or whatever is being grown) with
  your favorite Korean dip.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

 Categories: Soups, Beans
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 lb Pork Cubes
      2 lb Red Kidney Beans
           (This works fine with
           White Kidney Beans
           And Great with Lentils)
      4    Red or White Onions
           -Whole
      6 lg Tomatoes
      6 md Sized Potatoes - Cubes
      2 lg Chorizo de Bilbao
           (if this is not available
           Any Spanish Sausage with
           Lard will do), cut into
           Thin slices
      1    Ham Bone and/or
    1/2 c  Ham Scraps
      1 c  Olive Oil
      1 cl Garlic
           Vinegar
           Salt & Pepper to Taste
 
  Procedure:
  
        Soak the beans in water overnight. Drain. Put in a Large Pot
  with the Pork Cubes, Onions, Tomatoes, Potatoes, Sausages the Ham
  Bone and/or Ham Scraps and add water about 3/4 full. (Use a 2 Gallon
  Pot or at least 1 1/2 gl. to have enough liquid in it). Bring to a
  boil and once it starts to boil bring down the heat to simmer until
  the beans are tender.
        In a sauce pan, saute the Garlic  in Olive Oil. When Garlic is
  brown add the rest of the  Olive Oil and a few halved tomatoes and
  bring to a slight boil. Add this to your beans and season to taste
  with Salt, Pepper and a little Vinegar. Continue to let the Beans
  simmer for a few minutes before serving.
        If you cannot get good and juicy tomatoes you may use 1can/450
  g. of Tomato Sauce and add this to your sauted Garlic and bring to a
  boil. You need not add Vinegar since the Tomato sauce normally has
  vinegar already. If you are using Tomato Paste you must add a little
  vinegar.
        Serve hot with bread and wine. (This goes perfectly well with
  Garlic Bread and Red Wine)
        This can serve an army. However I prefer to take the left-over
  where the beans has already soaked the sauce and the flavor of the
  sausage and the ham. Just keep the leftover in your Frig and re-heat
  before serving. You may opt to let the whole dish cool down and store
  in your refrigerator for a day or two. Reheat it and serve hot.
        I have never bothered to look at the calorie count of this dish
  but I suppose it is very high. But then there is always a price for
  good food. Have a happy meal! DDD ED MONTALVAN

 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 tb Oil
      6    Sliced onions
     10    Or more cloves garlic
           -finely chopped
      2 l  Water or chicken stock
      4 sl Thick bread
 
  From Colombia in South America, this robust soup is just about a meal
  in itself on a cold night and easily rivals its better known cousin,
  French onion soup.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan and gently fry 6 sliced
  onions. Add 10 or more cloves of garlic, finely chopped, and continue
  cooking until the onion is transparent. Pour in 2 L water or chicken
  stock and simmer, covered, for half an hour. Put 4 thick slices of
  coarse bread in the bottom of four large soup bowls. When the soup is
  cooked, season it to taste, then break four eggs into the simmering
  liquid and poach until barely set. Using a slotted spoon, lift the
  eggs out onto the bread slices, then ladle the soup over the top.
  Serve very hot.

      1 lg Onion
      2    Cloves
      2    Turnips
      3    Carrots
      3 md Potatoes
      4 pt Water

      4 oz Unsmoked bacon -OR-
      4 ts Olive oil
    1/2    White Cabbage
           Wine vinegar
           Salt
 
  Soak the beans for a few hours; fill a large pan with 4 pt cold water,
  press the cloves into the onion, as if their were pins, and add to
  the pan with the beans. (resist the temptation to use canned beans;
  it's worth the extra trouble). Add the bacon cut into small pieces.
  When the beans are tender add the turnip cut into small cubes, the
  carrots sliced thinly and the pumpkin slice cut into large cubes.
  Discard the onion. When the carrots are almost cooked add the potato,
  peeled and cut into small cubes, the washed leaves of the turnip
  broken into medium size pieces by hand, and the leaves of the cabbage
  hand-shred into large pieces. Let everything cook together for a
  while, until soft. Place a teaspoon of vinegar in each bowl, and fill
  with the hot soup. Some soup lovers will add a dash of piri-piri
  sauce, or of Tabasco. The soup will taste even better if you boil a
  ham bone with the beans. If there is any meat left in the bone shred
  it and add to the soup. Discard the bone. (How obvious can I get?) <G>

 Categories: Soups/stews, Cuba, Update
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Dried black beans
      2 qt Cold water
      2 c  Coarsely chopped onion
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped scallions,
           -including green tops
      3 md Cloves garlic, minced
      1 ea Smoked ham hock
      2 ea Bay leaves, crumbled

      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ea Scotch bonnet-type chile,
           -seeded
    1/2 c  Dark rum
 
  Pick over the beans, rinse them, and put them in a large heavy pot
  with the water. Cover the pot and bring the water quickly to a boil.
  Stir the beans, remove them from the heat, and allow them to sit for
  1 hour. When the beans have softened, return the pot to the heat,
  adding more boiling water if necessary. Then add the remaining
  ingredients, with the exception of the rum. Continue to cook,
  covered, over low heat for several hours, until the beans are very
  tender and the ham falls off its bone. Remove from the heat and
  remove the ham hock bone and meat. Dice the meat finely and discard
  the bone. Press the remaining ingredients through a food mill, taste
  for seasoning, and add the diced ham. At this point, the soup can rest
  overnight in the refrigerator so that the flavors mingle, or it can be
  served at once. To serve, reheat the soup for 5 minutes while
  stirring in the rum. Side dishes of lemon wedges, cooked white rice,
  minced onion, or chopped hard-boiled eggs can be served as garnishes.

           - peeled & coarsely chopped
    1/2 ts Crumbled leaf thyme
    1/2 ts Ground coriander seeds
      1 lg Bay leaf; (do not crumble)
      1 qt Beef or chicken broth
           -(preferably homemade)
    1/2 lb Pepperoni or chorizo
           - or if available,
           - Portuguese chourico or
           - linguica,
           - sliced about 1/4-in thick
      1 c  Finely chopped fresh spinach
           - (leaves only)
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Olive oil
 
  SOAK THE GARBANZOS overnight in 6 cups of the water in a large heavy
  kettle. Next day, add the remaining 2 cups water, bring to a gentle
  boil, cover, and cook 4-to-5 hours or until the garbanzos are very
  tender. Meanwhile, stir-fry the garlic and onions in the peanut oil
  in a second large, heavy kettle over moderate heat for 12-to-15
  minutes until lightly browned. Add the potatoes and stir-fry 2-to-3
  minutes; add the thyme, coriander, and bay leaf, turn the heat down
  low, and allow to mellow about 10 minutes. Pour in the broth, bring
  all to a gentle simmer, cover and cook slowly. As soon as you've set
  the 2 kettles to simmer, stir-fry the pepperoni in a large heavy
  skillet 3-to-5 minutes--just until lightly browned and most of the
  drippings have cooked out. Drain the pepperoni well, reserving 1
  tablespoon of the drippings. Set aside. Return 1 tablespoon drippings
  to the skillet, add the spinach and stir-fry 2-to-3 minutes over
  moderate heat just until glazed and intensely green; reserve. When
  the garbanzos are tender, puree 1/2 of them by buzzing 60 seconds in
  a food processor, adding only enough kettle liquid to puree them
  easily. Return the pureed garbanzos to the kettle in which they
  cooked. Now puree the potato mixture in 2 batches, buzzing each
  30-to-40 seconds in a food processor. Blend the potato mixture into
  the garbanzo mixture, add the reserved pepperoni and spinach, cover,
  and simmer 30-to-40 minutes--just long enough to mellow the flavors.
  Season to taste with salt and pepper, remove the bay leaf, then
  smooth in the olive oil. Makes 6 to 8 Servings ~--

  celery, roughly chopped, several springs of parsley, left whole, 1/4
  teaspoon nutmeg and a dash of chilli powder or nutmeg. Simmer for
  half an hour. Remove and discard the celery and parsley. In a large
  bowl, beat together 2 egg yolks and 1/2 cup cream (or lower fat and
  cholesterol content by substituting evaporated skim milk). Gradually
  add hot soup. stirring constant- ly so that the egg doesn't curdle.
  Return the mixture to the saucepan over low heat and continue
  stirring until the soup thickens somewhat. Mash or process the flesh
  of 3 avocados and stir into the soup until well blended. Serve.

      Title: SORBETTO DI PARMIGIANO (SORBET OF PARMIGIANO
 Categories: Ice cream, Italian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Parmesan cheese; freshly /
           - finely grated
      3 c  Skim milk
      3    Egg yolks
      1 pn Salt
      1 pt Heavy cream
      2 lb Rock salt
 
  "Sorbetti became very popular in the eighteenth century, and the
  category included many non-sweet dishes. There is a famous treatise
  on sorbetti by a physician of the time, telling of the many
  therapeutic uses for these iced dishes. This one, of Parmigiano, is
  typical of the non-sweet examples, and perhaps the easiest to
  understand for the modern palate. It should be eaten in place of the
  cheese coarse, either instead of dessert or before it. The dish has
  an established place in the old Parma cooking and is *not* an
  experiment."
  
  Soak the grated Parmesan in a small crockery bowl with
        1    cup of the milk for 1 hour.
  
  Heat the remaining milk in a flameproof casserole and, when the milk
  reaches the boiling point, add the soaked Parmesan and the milk. Stir
  with a wooden spoon to keep the cheese from sticking to the bottom of
  the casserole. Simmer for 2 minutes.
  
  Line a small strainer with a heavy cheesecloth or paper towels and
  place it over a crockery bowl. Pour the contents of the casserole
  through the cheesecloth and let stand for about 1 hour to drain
  completely. Discard the gummy residue of the cheese remaining in the
  strainer. (This residue will have lost the flavor of years of aging
  and will resemble the bland fresh curd of Parmesan. The flavor, of
  course, will have been absorbed by the milk.)
  
  Be sure the liquid in the bowl has no cheese grains in it. Then
  prepare a "custard cream" using this liquid and 3 egg yolks and salt,
  following standard pastry cream directions.
  
  Transfer the cream to a crockery bowl and let stand until completely
  cool. Prepare the Sorbetto, following ice cream maker's directions.

  from chicken.  Cut off wings and leg-and-thigh pieces. Separate back
  from breast.
  
  Pour oil into 6 quart kettle and place over medium heat. Add garlic,

  legs and thighs, let cool. Continue to simmer broth. Discard skin
  from breast, legs and thighs. Cut meat into bite-sized pieces. Cover
  and set aside.
  
  Return bones to broth, continue simmering until broth is richly
  flavored (about 1 more hour). Strain, discard wings, back, bones,
  giblets, and seasonings. (At this point you may cover and refrigerate
  chicken and broth until next day.  Bring chicken to room temperature

  CONDIMENTS:  Offer at least two of the following: 2 ounces bean
  threads, cut into 6-inch lengths (soak in warm water to cover for 30
  minutes before cutting), or 1 1/2 cups cooked rice; 1 1/2 cups bean
  sprouts mixed with 1/4 cup chopped celery leaves; Spiced Coconut; and
  Chili Paste.
  
  Crisp-fried onions: Cut 2 medium onions in half lengthwise. Cut each
  half crosswise into even slices about 1/8 inch thick; then cut slices
  into halves or thirds to make smaller arcs. Into a deep heavy pan
  pour salad oil to a depth of 1 inch and heat to 300 F. Add about a
  third of the onions and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned
  (4-5 minutes). Oil temperature will drop at first, but rise again as
  the onions brown; regulate heat to maintain 300 F.  Remove onions
  with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining
  onions. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.

      Title: SOUFFLEED ACORN SQUASH
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 sm (3/4 pound) acorn squash
      4 ts Butter
      4 ts Brown sugar
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
           Grating of fresh nutmeg
      1 lg Egg separated
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  Preheat oven to 400 F. Wash outside of squash well to rid it of any
  grit. Using a sharp knife, cut a very thin slice off of both ends of
  the squash so that, when presented on a plate, each half stays stable
  on the dish and doesn't wobble. Cut the squash in half and with a
  spoon, scoop out the seeds and discard them.
  
  Place the halved squash, skin side up, in 1/2 inch of water in a
  baking dish so that the flesh steams and remains moist while it
  bakes. Bake for 30 minutes.
  
  Remove the baking dish from the oven. With a large spoon and tongs,
  turn the squash cut side up and place 1 tbsp. of butter in each half.
  Return the squash to the oven and continue baking for another 30
  minutes or until squash is tender. Using tongs, very carefully remove
  each squash half from the baking pan. As you remove them, pour the
  melted butter from the center of each into a mixing bowl.
  
  Carefully so as not to pierce the soft shell, spoon out the cooked
  squash from each and place it in a bowl. Make sure to leave some
  flesh all around the inside of the cavity of each half. Do not pierce
  the skin or the souffle mixture will run out.
  
  In a blender or food processor, puree the squash (in two batches if
  necessary to prevent the mixture from ``exploding'' from the heat as
  you puree it) and reserved melted butter with sugar, 1/2 tsp salt,
  1/4 tsp pepper, and egg yolk. Pour this into a mixing bowl. In
  another bowl, whip the egg white with a pinch of salt until stiff.
  Fold into squash mixture. Pour equal amounts of the souffle mixture
  into each hollowed-out cavity and bake on a baking sheet for 25
  minutes or until the tops are nice and brown and begin to crack.
  
  Serve in the squash shells as an appetizer or side dish.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------CHERRY 'SOUP-----------------------------
      1 kg Black cherries (2 1/4 lb),
           - stoned, weighing 400 g
           - (14 oz)
     30 g  Unsalted butter (1 oz)
     60 g  Sugar (2 oz)
           Kirsch

MMMMM--------------------------SOUFFLE-------------------------------
      1 x  Egg yolk
      2 x  Egg whites
     70 g  Sugar (2 1/2 oz)
  1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
 
  By 'soup' Fredy Girardet means what many peoples would call a compote.
  
  One day in advance, put 400 g (14 oz) stoned cherries into a frying
  pan with the butter. Cook them gently until the juice runs. Add the
  sugar and continue cooking until the sugar slightly caramelises. At
  this point, pour in a generous dash of kirsch and flambe it. Take the
  pan off the stove.
  
  Put the cherries into a strainer to drain them, and keep the juice.
  
  Just before serving, pre-heat the oven to 260 oC (500 oF).
  
  Divide the cherries between four little souffle dishes 6 cm (2 3/8
  in) in diameter and just cover them with their juice.
  
  Prepare the souffle mixture. Put the egg yolk into a basin with 35 g
  (1 1/4 oz) sugar. Beat it until it becomes pale and fluffy. Add half
  a tablespoon of lemon juice.
  
  In another basin, whisk the egg whites to firm peaks with the rest of
  the sugar, then fold in a tablespoonof lemon juice. Fold the whites
  delicately into the yolk mixture using a spatula.
  
  Top up the moulds with the souffle mixture.
  
  Bake the souffles at the bottom of the pre-heated oven for 5 minutes.
  
  Serve IMMEDIATELY.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 28 Servings
 
      3    Eggs; separated
      1 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter; melted, cooled
 
  These proportions make an eggier-tasting crepe.  Beat the egg yolks
  with part of the milk, add flour, sugar, salt, beat well. Add
  remaining milk gradually, then melted butter. Beat egg whites stiff.
  Fold into crepe mixture.  They either may be cooked in the usual way
  in a crepe pan or put into a large buttered pan and baked in a
  preheated 375F oven for about 25 to 30 minutes. This then becomes
  something like a flat souffle that can be topped with a filling or
  one can be put over half the batter, the rest poured on top. It can
  be a sweet filling like strawberries or apples and may be flavored
  with lemon rind, brandy, or vanilla.

  1 1/4 c  Bread flour
      1 c  Whole rye flour

      4 ts Active dry yeast
 
     Combine the beer and the vinegar in a small bowl
     and set aside for ten minutes.  This was wonderful
     when I used a dark bock beer, much more flavorful
     then when I used a low cost generic beer.  But the
     bread is good no matter which brand that you use.
     I substituted regular salt for the Sea Salt, with
     no ill effects.

  reduce the heat to low and carefully skim off any scum. Add onion,
  carrot, celery, bay leaf, peppercorns, and salt. Cover and simmer the
  chicken for 45 minutes to one hour. Remove the chicken from the broth
  and set aside to cool. Strain the remaining broth, discarding the
  solids, and place in the refrigerator to chill, or use fat separator

  handle, remove the meat from the bone and tear or shred into bite
  sized pieces. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

  add the onions, celery, carrots and garlic and cook over medium high

  and cook for 5 minutes more. Add the flour, salt and pepper and stir
  to combine, cooking for 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock (remove the
  fat that has accumulated at the top of the stock) and the evaporated
  skim milk. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and the
  cornstarch. Add to the soup, stirring until thickened and heated
  through. Add the cooked rice, shredded chicken and thyme, stirring
  until thick and bubbly. Serve at once.

  Note:  The secret to light and crispy Belgian waffles is folding in
  the egg whites.  Throwing them in with the egg yolks will work, but
  you'll get a heavier waffle.
  
  Separate the eggs and place egg yolks in one bowl, and the whites in
  another.  To the egg yolks, add the sour cream, milk, margarine and
  vanilla;  Mix well.  Add the flour, sugar and baking powder; mix well.
  
  With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until stiff. Fold into the
  batter with a spoon.

    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 c  Sour cream
      2 tb Creole seasoning
      2 tb Kosher salt for sprinkling
 
  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Sift together the flour, sugar, salt, and
  baking soda into a bowl or food processor. Cut in the butter. Add the
  sour cream and Creole Seasoning (see recipe for Creole Seasoning),
  and mix to a soft dough.  Roll out paper-thin on a floured board. Cut
  into 1-1/2 inch squares.  Sprinkle with kosher salt and place on an
  ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 5-8 minutes.  Turn off the heat and
  allow the bread to crisp in the oven. Nathalie Dupree describes this
  recipe in her book "New Southern Cooking" this way; "This crisp,
  cracker-like bread is good just flavored with salt and sour cream.
   But add Creole Seasoning and you'll have a hot and spicy appetizer
  that will leave your guests begging for the recipe. It's nice to keep
  a big airtight cookie jar full of these for snacking."
