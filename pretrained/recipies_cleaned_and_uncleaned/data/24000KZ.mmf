  that's why this dish is one of her favorites. :)

      4 oz Baking Chocolate

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
    1/3 c  Butter Or Regular Margarine
      3 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 c  Sour Cream
      3 oz Baking Chocolate
 
  Sift togetehr the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt
  into a large mixing bowl.  Add shortening, sour cream, vanilla, eggs,
  water and chocolate (melted then cooled).  Beat with an electric
  mixer at low speed, scraping bowl constantly, for 1/2 minute.
  Increase speed to high and beat an additional 3 minutes, scraping
  bowl occasionally. Pour batter into 2 greased and waxed-paper lined
  9-inch round cake pans. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. Oven for 35
  minutes or until cake tests done. Cool in pans on racks for 10
  minutes.  Remove from pans and cool completely on the racks. Place
  one cake layer on serving plate. Spread with Sour Cream / Chocolate
  Frosting.  Top with second cake layer.  Frost sides and top of the
  cake with the remaining Sour Cream/Chocolate Frosting. SOUR
  CREAM/CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Combine the softened butter or margarine,
  confectioners' sugar, and sour cream in a mixing bowl; blend well.
  Add chocolate which has been melted and cooled and vanilla. Beat
  until smooth. NOTE: I have seen reference to people having trouble
  with their layer cakes and how they rise.  Try this little trick when
  making this cake. Take the layer that has the least amount of rise on
  the top and trim it to be flat with a sharp knife.  Place the trimmed
  side down (layer should be upside down). Then frost between layers
  and place the other layer on right side up and finished frosting.  It
  will give the illusion of having a cake with only one domed layer and
  will sit better on your cake plate. Also the trimmings are great
  eating just plain for the cook or for the kids.

      Title: SOUR CREAM-ONION TWISTS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 90 Servings
 
  2 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/3 c  Very finely minced onion
      2 ts Dried chives, OR
      2 tb Fresh, finely chopped
           Chives
    1/3 c  Sour cream
 
  "These hearty crackers reflect the clean, clear flavors of sour cream
  and onions. They are impressive, reliable standbys for entertaining
  of all types. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.
  
  Stir together the flour, sugar, salt, and pepper in the food
  processor or a large bowl. Add the onion and mix well.
  
  In a separate bowl, thoroughly blend the sour cream and egg together.
  Add the sour cream mixture to the flour mixture and blend well to
  form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. If necessary
  to achieve the proper consistency for rolling, add 1 additional
  Tablespoon sour cream.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/16 inch thick. To make the
  twists, cut the dough into strips 3/4 inch by 6 inches. Twist the
  ends of each strip in opposite directions and press the ends down on
  the baking sheet to keep them from unwinding.
  
  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the twists are lightly browned.
  The ends will be slightly thinner from the pressing and will brown
  first. Cool on a rack. Yield: 85-90.
  
  VARIATIONS: If preferred, these crackers can be baked flat in 2-inch
  squares or circles. Be sure to remember to prick each one 2 or 3
  times with the tines of a fork. Brush the tops with a lightly beaten
  egg, if desired.

    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 tb Unsalted butter, softened

MMMMM--------------------------MUFFINS-------------------------------
      3    Med. peaches, pitted, diced
    1/2 c  Milk
      1    Lg. egg
    1/2 c  Sour cream
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      4 tb Butter, melted
      2 c  All-purpose flour

  Prepare topping:  In small bowl stir together the flour, sugar and
  cinnamon; with a fork, work in the butter until crumbly. Refrigerate
  until needed.
  
  Preheat oven to 400F.  Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners or
  generously butter the cups and the top of the pan around the muffin
  cups. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg. Then whisk in the sour cream,
  milk, vanilla and melted butter.  Stir in the diced peaches. In a
  large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking
  soda and salt. Pour in the sour cream-peach mixture all at once and
  stir quickly, just to moisten; the batter will be thick and lumpy.
  Spoon into muffin cups, dividing it equally until the cups are full.
  Quickly crumble the topping over the batter. Bake at 25 to 30 minutes
  or until golden brown. The tops will spring back when lightly
  touched.  Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes and then carefully remove
  and cool on a rack. Cool 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm.

      Title: SOUR CUCUMBER PICKLES
 Categories: Pickles
      Yield: 4 Cups
 
      4 c  Cucumbers (small)
      4 ts Sugar
      2 ts Canning/pickling salt
      2 ts Mustard, dry
    1/8 ts Alum
           Cider vinegar
           Water
 
  Wash cucumbers in cool water and pack into a canning jar big enough
  to hold them.  Add sugar, salt, dry mustard and alum. Fill jar about
  2/3 full with vinegar.  Fill remaining portion of jar to cover
  cucumbers with water. Put lid on jar.
  
  Agitate lightly every day for about a week to mix spices in with
  cucumbers. Then put in a cool dark place for about 3 months while the
  cucumbers work.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  The most lip smackin' pickles you ever tasted, this recipe came
  from my wife's grandmother.
  
  *  Don't be too impatient to try the pickles.  They taste terrible if
  they haven't worked.  Also, you do not have to seal these jars. They
  will keep for quite some time if stored in a cool/dark location.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 3 months waiting.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------WAFFLE STARTER----------------------------
      1 c  Sourdough starter
  1 1/2 c  Milk, warmed
    1/2 c  Graham flour (they come out
           -just fine using all white
           -flour too)
    1/4 lb Butter, melted
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Flour
      1 ts Sugar

MMMMM----------------------WAFFLE FINISHER---------------------------
      2    Eggs beaten
    1/4 ts Baking soda
 
  The night before breakfast, combine Waffle Starter ingredients in non-
  reactive bowl such as wood or plastic and mix with wooden spoon. Beat
  until smooth. Use a large bowl as this will double in size. Cover
  with plastic wrap. Replenish starter with a cup of water and a cup of
  flour. Cover starter. Allow both to sit overnight at room
  temperature. To make waffles the next morning: Preheat oven on very
  low temp. Warm the waffle iron, warm the plates in the oven. Beat
  eggs and add eggs and baking soda to the Waffle Starter. The Waffle
  Starter should be full of bubbles and have a sourdough smell by now.
  It may have collapsed and look odd. That's ok. Lighlty oil or butter
  the waffle iron when ready and pour in batter. Do not spread with a
  spoon. Let the batter flow to its own height. The batter should be
  neither stiff nor watery. It should pour smoothly and easily. Allow
  these to cook well, until golden brown, just a tad (30 seconds or a
  minute) past when you see the steam stop coming from the waffle
  maker. They will be nice and crisp yet  not crunchy. Delicious!
  ******************************** Hint: The batter will keep a day or
  two in the fridge, well covered. These also freeze well to make the
  best homemade 'eggo's type frozen waffles ever!
  ******************************** For pancakes, reduce butter to 4
  Tbs, or substitute 1/4 cup corn oil. ********************************
  As with any sourdough recipe, this lives and dies with the sourdough
  starter. The better the starter the better the end result. Still, the
  first time I made these I knew this was the recipe I had been looking
  for. Our cold Alaskan winters make a nice hot Saturday breakfast a
  warm and cozy start before facing the crackling cold air. These are
  guaranteed to be light and crispy with a flavorful sourdough tang.

  *Note: Finely chopped parsley may be substituted for coriander leaves.
  
  Wash lentils in several changes of cold water, or place in a sieve
  and run water through them.  Drain.
  
  Put lentils in a large pot with 8 cups water, spring onion, garlic if
  used, oil and coriander or parsley (or a combination of the two if
  preferred). Bring to the boil, cover pan and simmer on low heat for 1
  hour or until lentils are soft.

      Title: SOUR PUMPERNICKEL BREAD**
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Sourdough Starter
      2 c  Nonfat milk
      2    Tbl. blackstrap molasses
    1/4 c  Unsaturated oil
      1 c  Unbleached White Flour
      1 c  Whole rye flour
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
           SECOND DAY PREP:
      1    Tbl. salt
           Scant 1/2 tsp. baking soda
    1/2 c  Whole rye flour
  1 1/2 c  To 2 c unbleached enriched
           -white flour
      1 tb Caraway seeds
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
           THE GLAZE: optional
        x  Egg yolk
      1 tb Water
      1 tb Caraway seeds
 
  Yield: 3 loaves The texture of this loaf is medium-light making is
  perfect for sandwiches and toasting. The overnight rise makes this
  pumpernickel easier to knead than most rye recipes. Hints: Spray the
  loaves with water to develop a good thick crust. Rye flour can make
  for a heavy bread, so don't force in more of the white flour than
  required to handle the dough. If you don't want the shininess or the
  caraway seeds of the glaze, that step can be omitted.
  
  SOUR PUMPERNICKEL BREAD FIRST DAY PREP: Make up the sponge by
  combining in a large bowl all the first-day ingredients, mixing in
  the flour 1 cup at a time until the mixture is wet and smooth. Cover
  with a wet towel and allow to stand overnight in a draft free place.
  At least 12 hours later, stir the sponge down to its original size.
  Sprinkle the salt and soda over the surface, then stir in. Stir in
  the rye flour. Pour 1 C. of the white flour over your kneading
  boards, scrape the batter onto it, and knead the flour in. Then knead
  in the caraway seeds. This dough never completely stops sticking, so
  you can expect to use another 1/2 C. of white flour to sprinkle the
  board and your hands as you knead for another 5 min. to achieve a
  dough that can just be handled. Grease two baking sheets and sprinkle
  them with white cornmeal. Tap the sheets to spread the cornmeal
  evenly. Divide the dough into thirds and shape into three oblong
  loaves. Place two loaves on one sheet and one loaf on the other,
  leaving room between the loaves for spreading. With a sharp knife or
  single-edge razor, slash each loaf diagonally with three slashes, 1/4
  to 1/2-inch deep. Cover the loaves with a dry linen dish towel and
  put into a warm, draft-free place to rise for 2-3 hours. The loaves
  will look well risen and the slashes will gape wide. Gently, slash
  again into the same slashes, but only 1/8" deep. Spray the loaves
  with water. Starting in a cold oven set at 375^, bake for 40 minutes.
  After the loaves have been in the oven for 10 min., pull forward and
  spray them again with water. After 30 min., apply the glaze: Mix the
  egg yolk and water together, brush thinly over the loaves with a
  pastry brush, then quickly sprinkle with caraway seeds. After 40
  min., when the loaves are =almost= done, shut off the oven and allow
  to sit in the closed oven for another 10 minutes. This AVOIDS
  scorching. Cool on a wire rack and serve warm.

    1/4 c  Warm water
      1 pn Of sugar
      1 c  Tepid water
      2 c  Starter
      3 tb Carraway seeds
      1 c  Rye flour
      1 c  Gluten (can be purchased in
           -GNC stores or other
 
  health food places. It makes a difference in texture). Or see "joy of
  Cooking" to make your own gluten.
  
  Mix yeast, 1/4 cup tepid water and pinch sugar. Let dissolve and get
  frothy. Then add all ingredients together, knead dough till smooth.
  Let rise till doubled. Shape into two round loaves and let rise
  again. Set a pan of boiling water 2" deep on the lower shelf. Bake at
  425~ for 15 minutes, then lower temp to 350~ for another 30 minutes.
  This can also be made in a breadmaker. Comes out fine. If you have a
  smaller machine, halve the recipe. I just put all the stuff in the
  machine, R2D2, hit the button, and let it go. Delicious. Freezes well
  also. Hey guys, try getting a machine if you don't have one. Makes
  breadmaking easy and quick. I could have done the job in the time it
  took to type this.
  
  If someone can't eat food with seeds in it, just toss the carroway
  seeds into a blender or chopper and beat them to a powder and add to
  mixture
  
  Replace used starter with flour and water used, stir well, let sit
  out a few hours and refrigerate. On and on.

      Title: SOURDOUGH
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           Flour, divided
      1 ts Active dry yeast
      2 c  Hot (120F to 130F) water
      1 c  Lukewarm (100F) water
           SOURDOUGH STARTER
 
  Yield : Approximately 4 cups Difficulty: (one chocolate kiss, or easy)
  Prepartion: 10 minutes Allow at least 4 days for the starter to
  ferment before using. "Day 1: 1. In a medium bowl, stir together 2
  cups of the flour and yeast.  Make a well in the middle of the
  flour/yeast mixture and whisk in the hot water. Continue stirring
  until the mixture is blended but not completely smooth. It is not
  necessary to smooth out all the lumps; they will dissolve as the
  mixture start to ferment. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let
  the mixture sit at room temperature. Over the next 24 hours the
  mixture will rise, become very bubbly and then start to recede.
  
  "Days 2 and 3: 2. Stir the mixture twice, once in the morning and
  once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol.
  Towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
  the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
  bubbles. By the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
  liquid may form on the surface of the starter. It is simply the
  alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
  carbohydrates in the flour and multiply. Refresh the starter by
  stirring in the cup of lukewarm water (100F) and the remaining cup of
  flour. Stir until blended, but do not worry about any small lumps.
  
  "Day 4: 3. The starter is now ready to use, or it may be poured into a
  sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole, or a
  flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated.

      Title: SOURDOUGH (TC) PIZZA DOUGH
 Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
      Yield: 1 Crust
 
      1 ts Active dry yeast
      2 c  Bread flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Sourdough starter
      2 T  Water, if and as necessary
 
  Watch the dough carefully and adjust the amount of water or flour if
  necessary. Top with your favorite toppings.
  
  Directions for Thin Crust doughs: Preheat oven to 500F for at least 30
  minutes [I turn on the oven at the same time that I start the bread
  machine ~-OLS] if using a pan and at least 1 hour if using a stone.
  Grease the pizza pan with olive oil or spray it with a nonstick
  vegetable spray. A light dusting of cornmeal to further prevent
  sticking is optional - it usually adds a little crunch and flavor to
  the dough. If using a peel and stone, dust the peel to prevent the
  dough from sticking so that you may easily slide it off the peel and
  onto the stone. While the dough is rising, prepare your topping and
  grate your cheese; set aside. After the dough has risen 1 time, roll
  it out on a lightly floured or cornmeal-covered (I prefer cornmeal)
  countertop or handstretch the dough into a circle. Pick up the dough
  and turn it over and roll or stretch from the center outwards until a
  circle is formed. It may never be a perfect circle but that adds to
  the uniqueness of your homemade pizza. Dust the dough only as needed
  to prevent sticking with either flour or cornmeal. The thinner you
  roll or stretch the dough, the thinner the crust. A thinly rolled
  dough which does not rise a second time (after rolling) will give you
  the thinnest, crispiest crust. Lay the dough on your prepared pizza
  pan or peel. Pull the dough up around the edges of the pan so that a
  slight lip is formed, and crimp the edges. For a thin, crispy crust,
  place your toppings on the pizza and bake immediately. For a thicker,
  chewier crust, allow the dough to rise for 15 to 30 minutes. The
  longer the rise, the thicker the dough. Place your toppings on after
  this second rising and then bake. The toppings should be placed in
  such a way that the rim is left unadorned (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch
  border is good). This prevents spillage when baking and gives a nice
  piece of crust to hold when eating. Place the pizza on the bottom
  rack of the oven or directly on the pizza stone and bake until the
  crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted. If the oven was
  properly preheated, it should only take 5 to 10 minutes to bake a
  thin crust pizza.
  
  PRECOOKED SHELLS - Make extra pizza dough, roll it out and place it
  on the pan, screen or peel. Brush it with olive oil (or melted garlic
  butter) and pierce the dough every 1/2 inch or so with a fork (to
  prevent bubbles) [Note: The poking part is no joke, and not an
  option, unless you *want* to pull a big puffy balloon out of the
  oven. It's not as vital when you're topping the dough and putting it
  directly in the oven. --OLS] Bake the shell in a preheated 500F oven
  for about 5 minutes. Allow to cool, stack with waxed paper in between
  [foil works fine for me], wrap it well in plastic and freeze for up
  to 1 month. To use, remove dough from freezer (it is not necessary to
  thaw but you may), brush dough with oil to prevent sogginess [I
  haven't noticed any trouble without the oil], top as desired and bake
  in a preheated 450F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  If you want a very thin crust and end up with excess dough, simply
  form it into bread sticks, brush with a little water and sprinkle
  some kosher salt, poppy seeds or sesame seeds on top. Bake them right
  beside your pizza. [Other options that I've tried with success: salt
  and vinegar, garlic powder, and/or a little cayenne --OLS]

      Title: SOURDOUGH BASICS FROM STARTER TO FINISH
 Categories: Sourdough, Breads, Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Info
 
  "Those hot griddlecakes the forty-niners forked from the frying pan
  before setting out to dig for gold were, no doubt, sourdough
  pancakes. The hot biscuits so treasured by cowboys riding the dusty
  trail were most likely sourdough biscuits.  The life sustaining bread
  baked by pioneer women in crude stone ovens was probably sourdough
  bread. After the California gold rush, when the Klondike prospectors
  sailed from San Francisco to Alaska, they carried precious sourdough
  starter with them - and ever since sourdough bread has been
  assiciated with San Francisco. And in Alaska, a prospector with a pot
  of sourdough strapped to his back was quickly nicknamed a "sourdough".
  
  "As the population swelled westward during the last century, the
  practice of keeping a small amopunt of yesterday's dough alive to
  "start" tomorrow's bread was carried from one coast to the next, just
  as it had been carried from the Old World to the New. Archaeologists
  claim that leavened bread was first developed around 4,000 B.C., when
  using starters must have been the only way to accomplish leavening.
  Surely ancient bakers guarded their supplies zealously, just as
  thousands of years later propectors would tuck the sourdough pot into
  their bedroll at night to keep it warm and safe.
  
  "To this day, the distinctive flavor of so many European and Russian
  breads, as well as the famous San Francisco version of sourdough
  bread, is derived from the use of a sourdough starter. A starter is
  simply a self-perpetuating yeast mixture.  Traditionally it was made
  by mixing flour and water with a cooked potato or fruit such as wine
  grapes or ripe bananas.  Organisms in the flour and the germenting
  fruit attracted the wild yeast spores ubiquitous in an unpollouted
  environment, and a starter was easy to begin.  Today, this method is
  not always reliable owing to variables such as chlorinated water and
  pesticide treated flour, fruits and vegetables.
  
  "We've developed an easy sourdough starter by combining unbleached
  all-purpose flour, bakers active dry yeast, and water. With minimal
  care, the starter can be maintained for years and stored in the
  refrigerator (see box).  Since yeast is a single-cell fungus, its
  metabolic activity causes fermentation. As the yeast cells multiply
  and feed on the carbohydrates in the flour - which in turn give off
  carbon dioxide, alcohol and other compounds - the ongoing activity
  gives the sourdough starter its sour aroma and tart flavor.
  
  "Keeping a pot of sourdough going in your refrigerator opens up all
  sorts of possibilities.  Breads have an assertive tang and keep
  longer than other home-baked breads. Biscuits share the same
  distinctive flavor and are moist and fluffy.  Sourdough pancakes have
  a delicate texture and a subtle flavor that your family will clamor
  for on Sunday mornings. We're sure that once you begin baking with
  sourdough, you will become a convert for life.
  
  "SOURDOUGH STARTER MAINTENANCE
  
  "o Using and maintaining a sourdough starter is a cyclical process;
  you must always replace what you remove from the crock. If well
  maintained, a sourdough culture will last a lifetime.  Each time you
  take a portion of the starter for a recipe, replace that amount with
  equal quantities of water and flour. For example, if you remove 1 cup
  of starter to make Sourdough Country Bread, you must replace it with
  1 cup of lukewarm water (100F) and 1 cup of unbleached all-purpose
  flour. Whisk these ingredients into the starter until blended but not
  completely smooth. Any remaining lumps will dissolve as the mixture
  ferments. Cover and leave the starter at room temperature for at
  least 12 hours or overnight. The starter is now ready to be used
  again, or can be refrigerated.
  
  "o Use a 2-quart non-metal crock or bowl to store the starter. This
  wat, the replenishing starter ingredients can be mixed directly in
  the storage container.
  
  "o Maintain the starter by stirring it at least once a week. This
  invigorates the yeast and expels some of the alcohol. If you do not
  use the starter every two weeks or so, refresh it by removing 1 cup
  of the starter (give it to a friend or discard it), and adding 1 cup
  of unbleached all-purpose flour and 1 cup of lukewarm (100F) water.
  Whisk until blended. Cover and leave at room temperature 12 hours or
  overnight before returning it to the refrigerator.
  
  "o If you plan to be away or know you will not use the starter
  frequently, freeze it in a sterilized, air-tight freeezer container.
  Thaw the starter two days before you plan on baking with it,
  transferring it to a 2 quart non-metal storage container.  Refresh
  the starter withg 1 cup each of water and flour. Cover and leave at
  room temperature for 12 hours or overnight before using.  It's a good
  idea to freeze the starter in two containers; you can keep the second
  one frozen indefinitely to serve as a backup should anything happen
  to the thawed starter."

      Title: SOURDOUGH BREAD (BOB'S)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Lg loaves
 
      6 c  Flour (all-purpose or bread)
      1 tb Buckwheat flour
      1 tb Bran
      1 pk Yeast (1 Tbsp)
      2 c  Sourdough starter
  2 3/4 c  Warm (105-115 F) water
      1 tb Malt extract, powdered &
           -unflavored
      2 ts Salt
 
  Make a yeast sponge by mixing the starter with 1 cup warm water and 1
  1/4 cups flour. Cover the bowl with a towel and place in a warm spot
  for 24 hours. At that time, stir down the sponge and put 1/2 of it
  back into a jar and store in the fridge for your next baking.
  
  To make the bread: mix the yeast with 1 1/2 cups of warm water and
  allow to proof for 10 minutes. (Note: I sometimes use a mixture of
  beer and water to proof the yeast in, as it adds to the flavor of the
  bread.) Add the yeast mixture to the sponge, add the buckwheat flour,
  bran, malt extract, and salt. Mix well, then add the flour a cup at a
  time to form a soft dough. (Note: the 6 cups includes the 1 1/4 cups
  used in the sponge, so you will be adding 4 1/2 to 5 cups to make the
  dough) After adding 3-4 cups, turn the dough out on a floured surface
  and knead for 12 minutes adding the rest of the flour as the dough
  gets sticky. The dough should be soft and elastic, add only enough
  flour to get to this point where the dough is no longer sticky.
  (Note: malt extract can be found at stores selling home-brewing and
  wine making supplies as well as some health food stores.)
  
  Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat; let rise in a warm
  spot until doubled in bulk. Punch down the dough, remove from the
  bowl and knead for a couple of minutes. Let the dough rest for 5-10
  minutes, then cut in half and shape into 2 oval loaves.
  
  Cover the loaves with a towel and let rise until doubled or more (1-2
  hours). Allow the dough to rise in a cool spot for several hours to
  develop more of the sourdough flavor.
  
  Bake the bread in a preheated 400 F oven for 15 minutes, then lower
  the heat to 350 F for the next 15-20 minutes. Then reduce the oven to
  325 F for the final 15-25 minutes until the loaves are done. This
  lowering of the heat attempts to duplicate the falling heat in a
  baker's wood fired oven. Test the loaves for doneness by rapping on
  the bottoms, it is done when it sounds hollow. Cool on a rack before
  storing (if it lasts long enough to store!)

           -rt is real sour)
 
      The night before, or three to four hours before you intend to
  prepare these, combine sourdough start, buttermilk and 1 cup of the
  flour in a large bowl. Cover and let stand at room temperature. When
  ready to use, add egg and oil; stir well. Combine sugar, salt, baking
  powder and soda; sprinkle over top of batter. Fold in then add as
  much of the remaining flour to make a dough you can still stir (2 to
  3 cups should do it).
      To make Scones, dump batter out on a heavily floured board;
  sprinkle flour over top and roll out. Cut out scones. Allow scones to
  rise a few minutes then fry on both sides in hot oil until golden
  brown.
      For Biscuits, add enough flour to make moderately stiff, so you
  can knead dough. Knead a few minutes then roll and cut out biscuits.
  Drop both sides in oil or melted butter and place on cookie sheet.
  Let rise for an hour then bake at 375 degrees for 25 minutes.

      2 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Powdered cocoa (not instant)
      2 ts Baking powder
      2 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    3/4 c  Cold coffee
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Few people bake cakes from scratch anymore unless they can produce
  something that's not possible with a mix. This sourdough chocolate
  cake falls in that category. It's got a fudge-like quality you can't
  get any way except with sourdough and since it's all mixed in one
  bowl, it's almost as easy as a boxed cake.
  
  Put the starter in a large bowl, cover loosely and allow to stand at
  room temperature until active and bubbling -- at least one hour. Then
  add the rest of the ingredients, in the order given, beating well
  after each addition.  It is not necessary to sift or premix any of
  the ingredients as long as you are careful to get the baking powder
  and soda evenly mixed.
  
  Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, pour in the batter,
  which will be thin, and bake in a preheated 350. oven for about 30
  minutes, or until the layers test done when poked with a toothpick.
  The cake will have pulled away from the sides of the pan.
  
  Allow to cool about 10 minutes before removing from pans, then finish
  cooling the layers on wire racks. Do not frost until the cake is
  completely cold.
  
  A mild chocolate butter cream frosting is nice with this cake.

      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 pk Dry yeast
      1 c  Sourdough starter
 
  In a large bowl... Mix the dry yeast in body-heat water (about 1/4 to

      Title: SOURDOUGH FRENCH BREAD #4
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/4 c  Bread flour
      1 c  Starter, at room temp.
    1/2 tb Yeast (I use Fermipan or Red
           -Star)
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Tepid water (between 80 and
           -90 F)
 
  I take the starter out of the fridge 4 to 8 hours before I plan to
  start the bread. I feed it, then let it come up to room temp as it is
  digesting the feeding (1/2 cup A.P. Flour and 1/2 cup water). To
  start the bread, I measure everything but the water into the machine,
  set it for French Bread, and turn it on. I then drizzle the water
  into the machine slowly while it is running. That allows me to stop
  before 1/2 cup is added, should the flour have absorbed a lot of
  humidity from the air. For an extra crispy crust, I spray the dough
  lightly with water during the final rise (after the loaf-forming
  stage) and slash the top if I'm in the mood for a fancy look.
  
  Rye Variation
  
  Substitute 1/2 cup rye for 1/4 cup bread flour. Add 1 tsp caraway
  seed. May need a Tbs or so extra water.
  
  Sourdough Starter
  
  This starter is from the Food Processor Bread Book by the Editors of
  Consumer Guide. Published in 1980 by Simon and Schuster. ISBN
  0-671-25201-1. I have been using and abusing this starter for years.
  
  1 cup warm water 1 package active dry yeast 1/2 cup instant nonfat
  dry milk solids 1/2 cup unflavored natural yogurt 1 1/2 cups all
  purpose flour
  
  1. Combine water and yeast in large glass bowl, crock or other
  non-metallic container. Stir to dissolve yeast.
  
  2. Add dry milk and yogurt to yeast mixture. Beat with whisk until
  blended. Add flour and beat until smooth.
  
  3. Cover bowl tightly*. Let stand in warm place (85F) until starter
  has developed a sour aroma and is bubbly, 24 to 36 hours. Stir
  occasionally.
  
  4. Keep starter tightly covered in refrigerator. *
  
  5. To use, stir and pour off as much as recipe requires. Replenish
  remaining starter by blending in equal parts of flour and milk*. Cover
  tightly and let stand at room temperature until bubbly. Refrigerate.
  Starter should be used and replenished every two weeks.*
  
  In case you are wondering about those asterisks. Those are places
  where I have learned to depart from the stated instructions. BY NO
  MEANS, should you ever store your starter tightly covered! This is a
  great way to end up spending at least an hour cleaning your fridge. I
  keep the starter in an old instant coffee jar which has had the
  cardboard liner removed from the lid.
  
  This leaves a bit of a space when you screw down the lid for gas to
  escape. Even so, I don't screw down the lid all that tightly. I don't
  waste bread flour on the starter, all purpose is fine. I also have
  given up feeding milk to the starter, though I occasionally use whey
  leftover from making yogurt cheese. I have left this starter in the
  fridge unfed for up to six months and found only an inch of booze on
  the top that smells like cheap sherry. I generally stir that down
  with a dishwasher-safe plastic chopsticks and feed the beast. By next
  morning it is happily bubbling and ready to use. You will note that I
  feed first and then use. That way the starter can be doing something
  while it's coming up to room temperature, which is the best
  temperature to use it.

      Title: SOURDOUGH FRENCH BREAD FOR BREADMAKER
 Categories: Breads, Breadmaker
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
    1/2 tb Yeast
  2 1/4 c  Flour, bread
      1 c  Sourdough starter; room temp
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Water; tepid
 
  Put all ingredients except the water into the machine. Set it for
  french bread and start it. Slowly drizzle the water into the machine
  while it is running. Stop adding water when the dough forms a rough
  ball that cleans the sides of the pan. There should be no wet slime
  under the paddle. Let it knead for a while. The dough should get
  smooth and satiny. Touch the dough ball. It's okay if it barely
  sticks to your finger and feels tacky, but you finger should come
  away clean. This dough, not having any fat or oil is always just a
  hair stickier than normal white bread. It should not feel too dry. If
  it is dry, add a few drops of water. Close the lid and let it do its
  thing. After the loaf shaping stage you may mist the dough lightly
  with water to give it a crispier crust.
  
  Rye variation: substitute 1/2 cup rye flour for 1/2 cup bread flour.
  Add 1 tsp caraway seed.
  
  Note: Feed the starter and let it stand at room temp at least 4 hours
  before starting the bread (usually over night) Store starter in the
  fridge when not in daily use. I feed it with 1/2 cup all purpose
  flour and 1/2 cup water.
  
  Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comments: I wanted some sourdough
  loaves to take to work for a party, and used this one. I shaped the
  dough into 4 long ropes, which by the time they finished rising were
  bigger than I wanted. :(  I baked them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes
  with a pan of hot water on the bottom rack to get a good crisp crust,
  then flipped them over and baked another 10 minutes to get the bottom
  crisp too. Came out great!

      Title: SOURDOUGH FRENCH BREAD~ SAN FRANCISCO STYLE
 Categories: Breads, French
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Hot water
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 c  Sourdough starter
      4 c  Unsifted flour
      2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Soda
           About 2 cups unsifted flour.
 
  Dissolve yeast in hot water, pour into large mixing bowl and mix with
  starter. Add 4 cups flour, sugar and salt and stir vigorously for 3
  or 4 minutes. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until
  double in bulk (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Mix soda with 1 cup of the
  remaining flour and stir in; the dough will be stiff. Turn dough out
  onto a floured board and begin kneading; add the remaining 1 cup
  flour or more if necessary to control the stickiness. Knead until
  satiny -- between 5 and 10 minutes.
  
  Shape into oblong loaves or one large round loaf (my preference).
  Place on a lightly greased cooky sheet, cover, and place in a warm
  place; let rise to nearly double in size -- time will depend on
  warmth of spot ~- 1 1/2 to 2 hours in most kitchens.
  
  Before baking, brush outside with water, make diagonal slashes across
  the top with a sharp single edge razor blade. Put a shallow pan of
  hot water in the bottom of the oven. Bake in a hot oven -- 400 egrees
  ~- until the crust is a medium dark brown (about 45 minutes for
  oblong loaves and about 55 minutes for the large round loaf).
  
  For a more sour bread, leave out the yeast and 1/4 c of water but

      Title: SOURDOUGH ITALIAN BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Starter, Sourdough, Italian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Starter
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Lukewarm water
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      2    Cakes or packages yeast
  1 1/3 c  Lukewarm water
    1/2 c  Plus 1 tsp. grated Romano or
           -Parmesan cheese
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper (coarse)
      4    To 5 cups flour
      1 ts Sesame seed
 
  Early in the morning combine the starter, 1 tsp. salt, 1 cup lukewarm
  water and 1-1/2 cups flour.  Beat to blend thoroughly. Cover with a
  clean towel and set aside for approximately 5 hours. If the sponge
  has to set for a little longer or shorter period of time, it won't be
  hurt.
  
  When ready to finish the dough, stir the sponge down. Dissolve the
  yeast in the lukewarm water and add to the sponge. Now stir in the
  next 4 ingredients in the order given, adding 4 cups flour first, and
  then using the other cup of flour if needed.  Turn the dough out onto
  a lightly floured breadboard and knead thoroughly, about 7 to 10
  minutes. Then return the dough to a buttered bowl, cover with a clean
  towel, and set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. When
  doubled, punch the dough down and set aside, covered, for another 1/2
  hour.
  
  Now turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board again, and divide
  into 6 pieces of dough.  Roll and stretch each piece of dough into a
  long rope. Braid 3 of the ropes together for each loaf. Tuck the ends
  under, and lift each braid into a buttered glass loaf pan. Cover and
  set aside to rise until doubled again, about 1 hour. Brush loaves
  with melted butter and sprinkle each loaf with a mixture of 1 tsp.
  each sesame seed and grated Romano or Parmesan cheese. Bake loaves in
  375 oven until browned and done, about 40 to
       45    minutes.

      Title: SOURDOUGH MADE EASY
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12    To 24 hours until bubbly and
           -a clear liquid has formed
           -on top.
 
  SOURDOUGH STARTER
  
  1.  Heat 1 cup skim (nonfat) milk to 90F to 100F.
  
  2.  Stir in 3 tablespoons plain, fresh, high quality yogurt.
  
  3.  Pour mixture into a 1-quart glass or ceramic crock, jar, or bowl.
  Cover with a non-metallic lid; set in a warm place (between 70F to
  100F) for 24 hours.  On a warm day you can place the starter outside
  in the sun or on the kitchen counter.  On cooler days, place it in a
  gas oven with a pilot light, on top of the water heater, or on a
  heating pad set on low.
  
  4.  After 24 hours, the milk will thicken and form curds. At this
  point, gradually stir in 1 cup white flour until well blended. Cover
  with lid and set in a warm place again until it ferments and bubbles
  and a clear liquid forms on top, about 2 to 5 days.  Stir daily.
  
  5.  Starter is now ready to use.  Stir, cover loosely, and
  refrigerate.
  
  IF AT ANY POINT IN THE PROCESS THE STARTER TURNS PINK, SMELLS RANCID
  (NOT JUST SOUR), OR DEVELOPS A MOLD, THROW IT OUT AND START OVER.
  
  REPLENISHING THE STARTER
  
  Every time you use some of the starter you must replace it with a like
  amount of milk and flour.  For instance, if you use 1 cup of starter,
  return 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of flour to the jar. Follow the
  directions for feeding the starter.
  
  FEEDING THE STARTER TO KEEP IT ALIVE AND HEALTHY
  
  A starter should be used as often as possible, at least every 2 to 3
  weeks. If you are not using it that often, plan to feed it once a
  month to keep it going.
  
  1.  Bring the starter to room temperature.  (You can place it in a
  bowl of warm water to speed the process.)
  
  2.  Add equal amounts of warm milk (90F to 100F) and flour (1/2 to
  1 cup each)
  
  3.  Cover with lid and allow to stand in a warm place (70F to 100F)
  for
  
  4.  Stir, cover loosely (set lid on jar but do not tightly seal;
  gases must be allowed to escape), and refrigerate.
  
  REJUVENATING A NEGLECTED STARTER
  
  If you forget to feed your starter monthly, don't throw it away
  thinking it's gone bad.  Chances are you can still revive it. 1. Pour
  off the liquid and discard all but 1 to 2 tablespoons of the starter.
  Temporarily place reserved starter in a bowl. 2. Wash out the starter
  container with hot water. 3. Put the starter back into the container.
  4. Follow the directions for feeding the starter using 1 cup warm
  (90F to 100F) nonfat milk and 1 cup flour. 5. You may have to
  repeat this procedure once or twice to bring it back up to a bubbly,
  sour smelling starter again. SOURDOUGH FACTS TO KEEP IN MIND Use only
  wooden utensils and glass or ceramic containers. The acid in the
  starter will corrode any metal with which it comes in contact. Store
  loosely covered in the refrigerator; do not put in a tightly sealed
  container.  The gases must be allowed to escape. The yellowish or
  grayish-beige liquid that rises to the top is the "hooch". Just stir
  it back in before measuring out starter for a recipe. You can refresh
  your starter once a year or so with a few tablespoons of fresh,
  plain, good quality yogurt. For the sourest taste when making bread,
  mix the room temperature starter with the liquid and half the flour
  called for in the recipe. Cover and allow to stand in a warm place
  until bubbly and sour smelling, about 12 to 24 hours. At that point,
  combine the mixture in the bread machine with the rest of the
  ingredients in the recipe. Your starter can be frozen up to 3 months.
  Before using it again, let it thaw completely at room temperature for
  24 hours until bubbly. You may need to feed it once to bring it back
  to the bubbly stage after freezing. SUGGESTION: We have included a
  recipe for a San Francisco-type Sourdough French Bread. However, we
  feel you could create some very unique breads by using your starter
  in other recipes such as Tangy Buttermilk Cheese Bread, Basic Whole
  Wheat Bread, Lois's Rye Bread, Russian Black Bread, Apple Oatmeal
  Bread with Raisins, Dinner Rolls, Squaw Bread, Hamburger Buns, and
  English Muffins, just to name a few. Simply add 1/2 cup to 1 cup of
  the starter, as desired, to the recipe and decrease the liquid by
  approximately half the amount of starter used. (Example: Use 1/2 cup
  starter -- decrease the liquid by 1/4 cup.) From: "Bread Machine

MMMMM------------------DONNA G BM COOKBOOK III-----------------------
           -posted by Gaye Levy DTXT63A
  1 1/8 c  Sourdough starter
    1/2 c  Water
  1 1/4 ts Sugar
    3/4 ts Salt
  2 1/4 c  Bread flour
  1 1/2 ts Yeast
 
  This is for the medium sized loaf which, depending on how active my
  starter is at the moment, will rise to the top of my Hitachi B101.
  
  If I want an extra sour loaf, I will use the starter two or three days
  after feeding. This produces a shorter loaf with a heavier texture.
  
  For a light and fluffy loaf, I feed the starter first, then let it
  sit on the counter for 8 to 10 hours before using. I make sure it is
  very foamy when I put it in the B/M.

  Sylvia's notes: I substituted some chopped olives and leftover turkey
  for the pepperoni, and it came out fine. Overrose and then cratered,
  but I give up; after several tries, I haven't been able to produce a
  perfect loaf. If you don't mind cratered tops, the flavor's fine.

    This is an especially nice version of sourdough because the sweet
  raisins play off wonderfully against the sour. Another breakfast
  winner.
    Bake according to manufacturer's instructions, adding the raisins
  during the raisin-bread cycle, or five minutes before the final
  kneading is finished.

  Yipes!  You're right!  I left stuff out!  Sorry.  Here is the
  sourdough starter and corrected rye bread recipe. I've added the
  proportions of Rye Flour salt and sugar that I missed.
  
  1.  Combine the yeast, warm water, and sugar and let stand until very
  foamy, about 10 minutes..
  
  2.  Dissolve the salt in the tepid water ans stir thet mixture into
  the sourdough starter.   Beat in the yeast mixture, then the caraway
  seeds (or what ever you sub). Beat in the rye flour, about 1/2 cup at
  a time, then beat in the gluten flour.
  
  3.  Spread 2 cups of the all-purpose flour in a ring on a kneading
  surface and pur the dough into the center of the ring. Mix roughly
  with a dough scraper or a pancake turner, then knead just until
  thouroughly mixed, adding as much of the remaining white flour as
  necessary to make a medium-stiff dough, not too heavy.
  
  4.  Scrape the kneading surface, dust it with rye flour, and knead the
  dough very thouroughly until it is elastic and smoooth surfaced. Don't
  overflour the board; keep the dough as close as possible to medium
  stiff not heavy.
  
  5.  Form the dough into a ball and place in an ungreased bowl (it will
  stick a bit so you don't want to use metal); cover with plastic and
  let rise until doubled in bulk, at least 1 hour.
  
  6.  Turn the dough onto your kneading surface, dusted lightly with rye
  flour, then expel the air from it and form it inot two smooth balls.
  Cover with a towel and let rest 20 minutes, meanwhile sprinkling
  cornmeal on ===============   Reply   67 of Note    1

   Notes: A very light, slightly sour loaf of rye. This is somewhat
  different than many of the other sourdoughs as it has its own
  starter, which is used in its entirety in the recipe. Molasses may be
  substituted for the barley malt syrup.
  
   STARTER:             1 1/2 lb loaf:  1 lb loaf: milk 1 cup 3/4 cup
  rye flour            1 cup           3/4 cup yeast 1 1/3 tsp 1 tsp
  
   To prepare the starter: sprinkle yeast over warm water and stir until
  dissolved; then stir in the rye flour. cover and let stand at room
  temperature for 3 days, stirring once a day. Use the entire starter
  in your bread recipe.

  1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water

  In a glass or ceramic bowl, or jar that has been scalded, combine

  in a warm, draft-free place, at an even 85F for 3 days.; stir several
  times daily. Remove onion slice and refrigerate until ready to use.
  Onion imparts a strong flavor and this starter can only be used with
  compatible rye recipes; rye starter without onion can be used in any
  rye sourdough recipe. To replenish, always use rye flour. If starter
  does not seem bubbly after replenishing and standing 12 hrs, sprinkle
  1 t yeast over and stir in well. Like whole wheat starter, you may
  have to plan longer rising times for dough made with this one.

  in warm place 1 hr or until double in bulk. Combine 1 c of the
  remaining flour with baking soda. Stir batter down and add
  flour-baking soda mixture. Gradually add remaining flour to make a
  stiff dough. Turn out onto floured board and knead, adding additional
  flour only as needed to prevent sticking, approx 300 strokes of
  folding and turnin or until dough is smooth and elastic. Sprinkle a
  greased baking sheet with cornmeal. Form dough into 2 oblong loaves
  and place on sheet. Cover with towel and let rise in warm place 1 to
  1-1/2 hr or until not quite double in size. With sharp razor, slash
  the tops of loaves diagonally. Mist with water and bake in 450 oven
  10 mins. Reduce heat to 400 and bake 35 mins longer or until bread
  tests done. For a harder crust, place a pan of hot water on bottom of
  oven and mist with water several times during baking. Remove pan of
  water after 15 mins of baking. Turn out onto wire rack and cool.
  NOTE: If you like your sourdough very dar, remove the baked bread
  from the pan or sheet and place under broiler about 2 mins, or until
  rich brown in color.

  (or replenish) every 10 days, either by removing 1 cup and throwing
  it away or giving away, and adding 3/4 c flour and 3/4 c water to
  remainder, or by stirring in 1 tsp sugar. I cover with a cheesecloth,
  doubled. The consistency ranges from thin cream to cake batter,
  depending on proportions of flour and water, and weather. Oh, the
  starter might look "dead" to you at times, but just replenish and see
  if it starts bubbling within about 4 hours, if so, it is still alive
  and kicking. Hope I got it all in, write if you need more info...

 Categories: Breads, Sourdough
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           Flour, divided
      1 ts Active dry yeast
      2 c  Hot (120F to 130F) water
      1 c  Lukewarm (100F) water
           SOURDOUGH STARTER
 
  Yield : Approximately 4 cups Difficulty: (one chocolate kiss, or easy)
  Prepartion: 10 minutes Allow at least 4 days for the starter to
  ferment before using. "Day 1: 1. In a medium bowl, stir together 2
  cups of the flour and yeast.  Make a well in the middle of the
  flour/yeast mixture and whisk in the hot water. Continue stirring
  until the mixture is blended but not completely smooth. It is not
  necessary to smooth out all the lumps; they will dissolve as the
  mixture start to ferment. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let
  the mixture sit at room temperature. Over the next 24 hours the
  mixture will rise, become very bubbly and then start to recede.
  
  "Days 2 and 3: 2. Stir the mixture twice, once in the morning and
  once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol.
  Towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
  the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
  bubbles. By the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
  liquid may form on the surface of the starter. It is simply the
  alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
  carbohydrates in the flour and multiply. Refresh the starter by
  stirring in the cup of lukewarm water (100F) and the remaining cup of
  flour. Stir until blended, but do not worry about any small lumps.
  
  "Day 4: 3. The starter is now ready to use, or it may be poured into a
  sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole, or a
  flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated.

      2 c  Skim milk
      2 c  Bread flour
      1 pk Yeast
 
  Place milk in a glass container and allow to stand at room
  temperature for 24 hours. Stir in flour and yeast. Leave uncovered in
  a warm place for 2-5 days, depending on how long it takes it to
  bubble and sour. If it starts to dry out, stir in enough tepid water
  to bring it back to the original consistency. Once it has a good sour
  aroma and is full of bubbles, it is ready to use. Try to maintain
  about 1 and 1/2 cups of starter. Each time part of the starter is
  used,
  
  replenish with a mixture of equal parts milk and flour. Leave at room
  temperature several hours or overnight, or until it begins to fill
  with bubbles. Then cover and store in refrigerator. Starter is best
  if used at least once a week. If starter isn't, used for 2 or 3
  weeks, spoon out and discard about half and replenish as described.
  Given attention, a starter becomes more flavorful with age. Starter
  can be frozen if it is not to be used for several weeks. This will
  slow down yeast action and should be left at room temperature for 24
  hours after thawing. Sourdough Bread: 2/3 cup skim milk 1 cup
  sourdough starter 3 cups bread flour 2 Tbs.sugar 2 tsp. lite salt 1 &
  1/2 tsp. yeast 2 Tbs. liquid Butter Buds Combine above thoroughly
  (using half of the flour) and let stand uncovered to ferment
  overnight in a warm place. Next morning, after the mixture has risen
  and fallen, stir down any crust that may have formed. Add the rest of
  the flour. When thoroughly mixed, turn out onto a board covered with
  a little flour so it won't stick. Shape dough into 2 loaves, put into
  bread pans, brush lightly with liquid Butter Buds, and let rise
  covered until almost doubled in size. Bake in a pre-heated 400F. oven
  45-50 minutes. Note: This recipe works GREAT in a bread machine.

    A true sourdough starter is nothing more than the flour and milk or
  water which sits at room temperature for several days and catches
  live yeast bacteria from the air. Most starter recipes today include
  yeast as an original ingredient as it is much easier and less time
  consuming. In addition, many sourdough bread recipes also indicate
  usage of yeast itself as it does provide a higher rising, lighter
  loaf.
    A sourdough starter should be kept in a glass or plastic bowl which
  has a tight fitting lid. I recommend a bowl instead of a jar as you
  can "feed" your starter right in the bowl easily. To make your
  starter, mix together: INGREDIENTS: 2 cup lukewarm milk
        2    cup bread flour
    2 1/2    tsp yeast (one package)
    Mix the starter with an electric or hand held mixer on the lowest
  setting. Cover your starter and place in a warm, draft-free location
  for 4 to 7 days, gently stirring it once a day. You may notice that
  the mixture bubbles and in some cases it may even overflow the bowl.
  This is an indication that you have a healthy starter which should
  simply be poured off and discarded.
    If your starter ever changes colors, to purple, for example,
  discard and start another one.
    After allowing your starter to sit for 4 to 7 days it is ready to be
  used. Take out whatever portion your recipe calls for and put into the
  machine as you would any liquid ingredient. After removing a portion
  from the starter, the starter must be "fed". Simply add equal
  portions of milk or water and flour as was used. For example, if you
  used 1 cup of starter, replace it with 1 cup of water and 1 cup of
  bread flour.
    Some hints on feeding your starter: always use the same kind of
  flour. If you used bread flour in your original starter, use bread
  flour to feed it. Also, alternate between milk and water for each
  feeding. Since your original liquid ingredient was milk, the first
  liquid feeding should be with water. If you forget which you used
  last, that's okay, but try to alternate at least every other time.
  After feeding your starter, let it sit at room temperature for about
  one day and then refrigerate. =Continued=

  =Continued=
    Many cookbooks suggest stirring the starter once a day even when
  being refrigerated; I find that it is not necessary. You must,
  however, use a portion of the starter at least once a week. If you
  choose not to bake sourdough breads that often, then remove a cup of
  your starter and feed it as though you used some during the week. If
  this is not done, your starter will turn rancid and have to be
  replaced. Should you be away on vacation or otherwise not able to
  tend to the starter, freeze it. Upon your return, thaw it in the
  refrigerator and then remove a portion and feed it as soon as you are
  able.
    You may be thinking that this sounds too complicated, but it really
  is not, nor is the starter overly fragile. A friend of mine had the
  same starter for 14 years!
    My first few loaves of sourdough were not very sour and I feared it
  was my starter. After allowing the starter to mellow a little by
  sitting in the refrigerator and using only once a week, it and the
  breads became more sour.
    Another hint is to put the bread in on the timer cycle for early
  morning baking. The milk put in the night before adds a little more
  sour taste. If the bread is getting too sour for you, feed with water
  more often than milk. Source: The Bread Machine Cookbook by Donna

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Skim or lowfat milk
      3 tb Yogurt;plain or lofat
 
    Warm a 1 1/2 quart glass, ceramic, rigid plastic, or stainless steel
  container by filling it with hot water and letting it stand for
  several minutes; wipe dry.
    Heat 1 cup skim or lo-fat milk to 90-100  on a thermometer. Remove
  from heat and stir in 3 tablespooons plain unflavored, lo-fat yogurt.
  Pour into warm container, cover tightly, and let stand in a warm
  place (80 - 100 ).
    After 18 to 24 hours, starter should be about the consistency of
  yogurt (a curd forms and mixture does not flow readily when container
  is slightly tilted). During this time, if some clear liquid rises to
  top of milk, simply stir it back in. However, if liquid has turned
  light pink, it idicates that the milk is beginning to break down;
  discard and try again.
    After a curd has formed, gradually stir 1 cup all purpose flour into
  starter until smooth. Cover tightly and let stand in a warm place (80
  ~ 100 ) until mixture is full of bubbles and has a good sour smell;
  this takes 2 to 5 days.
    During this time if clear liquid forms, stir it back into starter.
  /But if liquid turns pink, spoon out and discard all but 1/4 cup
  starter; thin blend in a mixture of 1 cup each warm milk (90 - 100 )
  and flour. Cover tightly and let stand in warm place until bubbly and
  sour smelling; then it is ready to use.
    To store, cover and refrigerate. Makes about 1 1/2 cups starter.
    To maintain an ample supply, repelenish your starter every time you
  use it. Do this by adding a mixture of 1/2 cup each warm milk (90 -
  100 ) and flour. Cover and let stand in a warm place for several
  hours or until next day; mixture should be full of bubbles again.
  Store covered in refrigerator.
    For consistent flavor, continue using the same type of milk you
  originally used. Always let your starter come to room temperature
  before using it; this takes 4 to 6 hours. If you plan to bake in the
  morning, leave it out the night before.
    If you bake regularly- about once a week - the starter should keep
  lively and active. You can check your starter occasionally to see if
  its active by spooning out about 1/4 cup of the starter and mixing it
  with 1/2 cup each warm milk (90  - 100 ) and flour. Cover and let
  stand in a warm spot. Check often; it should bubble again in 4 to 8
  hours. You can combine this mixture with the original starter after
  the test.
    If  you dont bake often, its best to discard about half your
  starter and replenish it with warm milk and flour about every 2
  months to keep it active.
    The feel of dough containing sourdough starter is slightly tacky
  when lightly touched. =============== Reply 82 of Note 1

  like whipping cream. Put it in a GLASS JAR with a screw type lid;
  place in refrigerator. IT WILL KEEP FOR MONTHS. Growing better as it
  continues to age at a very slow pace. I have no idea regarding
  conversion for use in BM. IF YOU DO.. Let ME know..Ho-Kay? It is

  Recipe by: KKPD13B    Linda Caldwell As many of you know, I'm excited
  about using Donna German's new book WORLDWIDE SOURDOUGHS FROM YOUR
  BREAD MACHINE. the information in this book is of interest to "by
  hand" bakers, too. Here's an example! "If the culture has not been
  used in a month or so, it may require 1 or 2 feedings prior to using
  to bring it back >>> up to its fast rising capacity. The more often
  the culture is used, the faster it is, and the better it will rise.
  1.Remove the culture from the refrigerator 2.Divide the culture in
  half, placing each half in its own 1 quart wide mouth jar or plastic
  container 3. Add 1/2 C warm (95f to 100f) water and 1/2 C white bread
  flour to each of the cultures. 4. Place lid on jars but do not fasten
  tightly. 5. Place jars in proofing box at 85f. Leave jars in proofing
    box until foamy bubbles appear. This may take a few >>> hours or
  from one to several days depending on how long the culture was
  dormant. I'll put information on making a "proofing box" under its
  own later. My starter's out on the kitchen counter and has just been
  fed. Since it wasn't used for almost a month while I was away it may
  take a while to get it ready to use. If it foams up soon, I'll make a
  loaf today without the commercial yeast. It DOES take a while but is
  very good. Linda in Birmingham *P SC          07/30/94  08:57:14 AM

      1    Sourdough info
 
  Recipe by: KKPD13B    Linda Caldwell I've found another interesting
  quote from Donna German regarding the feeding and care of your
  sourdough starter. "If you're using the culture every month or so,
  you don't have to feed it at all.  If the relationship sours, so to
  speak, and you decide to break it off for a while, the question of
  maintenance comes up in case you patch things >> over and want to
  have another "wild fling" Store the culture in a refrigerator, and
  then warm it up and feed it about once every 6 months. The longer it
  lies dormant, the more TLC is needed to bring it back. Feeding every
  12 hours for 3 to 4 days with vigorous stirring will always rescue
  it." My particular starter is staging a nice comeback right now.
  Think I'll do a lovely SD round loaf and bake it on my stone! Linda

  Sylvia's comments: this came out great except that the dough looked
  too dry, so I added a tiny bit more water and it overrose, with a
  texture a little too coarse to suit me. Next time I'll just use the
  amount of water called for.
  
  If you don't want whole wheat, but prefer a white bread base,
  substitute 3-1/2 cups bread or AP flour for the 2 Cups whole wheat
  AND the 1-1/2 cups bread or AP flour measurements.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast
      2 c  Warm water
      2 c  Flour
 
  1. Empty yeast into mixing bowl and stir in warm water until
     dissolved. Add flour and stir until well blended. Cover with
     plastic wrap and allow to  stand at room temperature (or in oven
     out of drafts) for at least 48 hours, or until hooch (clear liquid)
     forms on top. 2. Store in refrigerator in a jar with a loose
  fitting lid (I like to use
     a plastic peanut butter jar) . Renew monthly by adding alternately
     1  cup of water or 1 cup of milk, and 1 cup of flour. 1/4 cup of
     sugar may be added every other month to add to the fermentation. 3.
  Always save at least one-cup of the fermented mixture to use as
     on-going starter. If recipe calls for 3 cups of starter, add 3 cups
     of milk (or water) and three cups of flour. Allow to stand until
     clear liquid forms on top. Save 1-cup for future use and use the
     extra 3 cups in the recipe.

  cover tightly and let stand in a warm place for 18 to 24 hours. Be
  sure to punch a small hole in container lid to allow gases to escape.
  Mixture should resemble the consistency of yogurt. A curd shold form
  and the mixture shold not flow readily when the container is slightly
  tilted. If clear liquid rised to the top of mixture, simply stir it
  back in. If liquid or starter turns pink, discard mixture and start
  again.
  
  After curd has formed, gradually stir 1 cup flour into the starter
  until smoothly blended.  Cover tightly and let stand in a warm place
  85F (30C) until mixture is full of bubbles and has a good sour smell,
  approximately 2 to 5 days.  If clear liquid forms on top of mixture,
  stir it back into starter.  Each time you use part of your starter
  replenish it with equal amounts of warm milk 100F (38C) and flour.
  Cover and let stand in a warm place several hours or overnight until
  it is full of bubbles. Cover and store in refrigerator until needed.
  Starter should always be at room temperature before using. Low-fat or
  skim milk may be used in place of whole milk.  Always be consistent
  in type of milk used.

      Title: SOURDOUGH~ PT. 2
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           Flour, divided
      1 ts Active dry yeast
      2 c  Hot (120F to 130F) water
      1 c  Lukewarm (100F) water
           SOURDOUGH STARTER
 
  Yield : Approximately 4 cups Difficulty: (one chocolate kiss, or easy)
  Prepartion: 10 minutes Allow at least 4 days for the starter to
  ferment before using. "Day 1: 1. In a medium bowl, stir together 2
  cups of the flour and yeast.  Make a well in the middle of the
  flour/yeast mixture and whisk in the hot water. Continue stirring
  until the mixture is blended but not completely smooth. It is not
  necessary to smooth out all the lumps; they will dissolve as the
  mixture start to ferment. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let
  the mixture sit at room temperature. Over the next 24 hours the
  mixture will rise, become very bubbly and then start to recede.
  
  "Days 2 and 3: 2. Stir the mixture twice, once in the morning and
  once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol.
  Towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
  the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
  bubbles. By the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
  liquid may form on the surface of the starter. It is simply the
  alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
  carbohydrates in the flour and multiply. Refresh the starter by
  stirring in the cup of lukewarm water (100F) and the remaining cup of
  flour. Stir until blended, but do not worry about any small lumps.
  
  "Day 4: 3. The starter is now ready to use, or it may be poured into a
  sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole, or a
  flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated.

      Title: SOUREST SOURDOUGH
 Categories: Breadmaker
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Gaye Levy ** DTXT63A
           -Revised on 9/17/92
  1 1/4 c  Sourdough starter
    1/2 c  Water
      3 c  Bread flour
      1 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Yeast
 
  Set starter out on counter and bring to room temperature. Feed as you
  normally do and allow to become foamy and active. This will take 8 to
  12 hours.
  
  Put all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle. When the
  cycle is complete, remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a
  damp towel and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes. (This rest period
  makes the dough more pliable.)
  
  Sprinkle corn meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical
  loaves. Place loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet or in a
  special "baguette pan" that can be purchased at a kitchen store.
  Cover again with the damp towel and put in the refer for 12 to 24
  hours. Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with water, and let it
  sit out until the loaves are fully risen. (They will usually rise a
  little in the refer, too.)
  
  Spray again with water then bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown
  and crusty. If you want a really crusty bread, spray the loaf with
  water every five minutes while baking. This harder to describe than
  it is to do ... and the results are worth it!
  
  PLEASE NOTE: Depending on the temperature, humidity, and the whim of
  the starter, the bread will vary from batch to batch. Sometimes it is
  very sour and dense while other times it is mildly sour and fluffy
  inside. Each batch is unique...but it is always good. I found that
  using the special pan helped the baguettes keep their shape. The pan
  is well worth the fifteen bucks. You can also vary the flavor of the
  bread by using more or less sugar or by substituting 1 TBL of vinegar
  for 1 TBL of water. Another variation is to use flat beer instead of
  water in either the recipe or when feeding the starter.  (Be sure to
  separate your starter into two batches first so that you do not
  contaminate the orignal pot.)
  
  Everytime I share this recipe, I get notes saying this is the beat
  sourdough ever! 05/31 08:59 pm LORELI Loafing and Laughing in Ocala,

      Title: SOUTH INDIAN DOSAS
 Categories: Bakery, Indian, Breakfast, Snacks, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Pancakes
 
    1/2 c  Urad dal
      1 c  Long-grain rice
    3/4 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Ground cumin seeds
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil (about)
 
  Pick over and wash urad dal.  Soak in 2 cups water for
        8    hours.
  
  Wash rice and soak in 3 cups water for 8 hours.
  
  Drain dal; blend in food processor or blender for 2 minutes, scraping
  down sides occasionally.  Add 2 tablespoons water and process another
  minute. Add another 2 tablespoons water and process again for one
  minute. Continue adding water until you've reached 3/4 cup total, and
  mixture is light and fluffy.  Place in a bowl and set aside.
  
  Drain rice; blend in food processor or blender, adding 3/4 of water 2
  tablespoons at a time, until mixture resembles fine grains of
  semolina. Combine rice mixture with dal mixture. Cover and leave in a
  warm place to ferment, 16-20 hours.
  
  The fermented batter should be frothy.  Add the salt and cumin and
  stir to combine.
  
  Have all cooking paraphernalia ready and at hand.  You will need to
  have near your skillet: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of vegetable oil in a cup or
  bowl with a small spoon, a larger spoon to spread the batter, the
  bowl of batter with a 1/2-cup measuring scoop/cup, a metal spatula
  for turning the pancakes, and a plate on which to place the finished
  dosas after they are cooked.
  
  Pour 1 teaspoon of oil into the skillet and tilt to distribute
  evenly. Heat the skillet over medium-low until oil is hot. Pour 1/2
  cup of the mixture onto the center of the hot skillet. Use the large
  spoon to spread the batter in a spiral motion, until the pancake is
  about 6-7 inches in diameter.  Turn pancake after 2 minutes and cook
  another 2 minutes on the other side, until lightly browned. Remove
  pancake to plate and repeat with remaining batter, adding only enough
  additional oil to the skillet as needed to keep surface evenly
  greased. I found that about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon for each pancake was
  plenty, but your mileage may vary.
  
  Serve with relishes, pickles, chutney, or cooked vegetables.

  4.  Divide chicken over all.
  
  5.  Cover with avocado salsa.
  
  MENU SUGGESTION:  To complete 1 vegetable card: Accompany with each
  serving, 3/4 cup crunchy raw vegetables such as broccoli and
  cauliflower flowerettes, carrot and celery sticks.  To complete 1
  dairy card: Accompany each serving with 7 ounces ice cold non-fat
  milk.
  
  By the way, the rest of the avocado WILL KEEP. Cutting into it isn't a
  license to eat the whole thing. Leave the pit in and cover it with
  plastic wrap and don't forget, 1/8 avocado = 1 fat card.

      Title: SOUTH TEXAS OYSTERS
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Jaw
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    Dozen small oysters, drained
      1    12 oz bottle of chili sauce
      2 tb Bell peppers, chopped
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
     12    Slices bacon, cooked and
           Crumbled
    3/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Simmer oysters in a skillet until their edges begin to curl. The
  oysters make enough of their own liquid to do this. Drain the oysters
  and transfer to glass baking dish. Add chili sauce, bell pepper,
  Worcestershire sauce, bacon and cheese. Place in oven 10 minutes
  (didn't say what temp. - probably just long enough to melt the
  cheese). Serve with toothpicks and toast points (I'm assuming you
  DON'T eat the toothpicks ;)

      Title: SOUTH-WESTERN BLACK EYED PEAS
 Categories: Main dish, Mexican, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Dried black eyed peas
      4 c  Water
    1/4 ts Red chile flakes, crushed
    1/2 ts Cumin
      2 tb Olive oil
    3/4 c  Green onions, thinly sliced
      2 ea Celery ribs, thinly sliced
      3 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      2 c  Mexican style stewed Tomatoe
 
  Rinse beans, cover in water & bring to a boil.  Cook for 3 minutes,
  remove from heat & let sit for 1 hour. Drain & rinse. Cover with
  fresh water, bring back to a boil & cook for 30 minutes. Drain & set
  side.
  
  Saute chile flakes in oil for 1 minute.  Add green onions, celery,
  garlic & beans.  Cook over medium heat, stirring, for 5 minutes. Stir
  in the tomatoes. Reduce heat & simmer for 30 minutes. Serve hot.
  
  MARK'S NOTE: I really do not think that black-eyed peas need this much
  cooking.  When making this dish, I omit the soaking stage & just cook
  for 30 minutes & then let them finish cooking with the remaining
  ingredients.

      Title: SOUTH: GOANESE FIERY DUCK CURRY IN VINDALOO S
 Categories: Indian, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      6    Dried red chiles, stemmed
           -and broken
    1/2 c  Distilled white vinegar
      4    Garlic cloves, peeled
      1    Half-inch piece peeled fresh
           -ginger
      2 ts Ground cumin
      2 ts Ground coriander
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      4 lb Duck, quartered and skinned
      2 tb Mild vegetable oil
      1 ts Salt, or to taste
      1 c  Water
      2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Minced cilantro or parsley
 
  Goa has developed its own cuisine and vindaloo is one of its main
  creations. Two important features of vindaloo are the technique of
  marinating meat in vinegar and the use of fiery spices. Although I
  have reduced the number of chiles, 4 more may be added if a hotter
  dish is desired. Cornish hens may be substituted for duck.
  
  Soak chiles in vinegar for 15 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and
  blend into a puree. Scrape mixture into a small bowl. Add cumin,
  coriander and cinnamon and mix thoroughly. Coat duck pieces well with
  spice paste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
  
  Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add duck pieces
  and brown on all sides. Add salt, water, sugar and any remaining
  spice puree. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer, stirring
  occasionally, until duck is tender, about 1 hour. Skim off all fat.
  Transfer duck to a heated platter, pour sauce over, and garnish with
  minced cilantro.

  Ingredients:
  
  garbanzo flour or brown rice flour corn flakes celery salt sage touch
  of salt nutritional yeast (lots) margerine corn meal tofu Cup up as
  much tofu as you think you'll eat into 1/4 inch thick slices. In a
  medium bowl mix up all the dry ingredients.  In a small skillet, heat
  up 1/2 1 stick margerine.  When completely melted, dip tofu into
  margerine enough to moisten the surface.  Transfer tofu to dry
  breading, and cover both sides. Transfer breaded tofu to a lightly
  greased tray, casserole dish, or cookie sheet. Bake until
  crunchy/warm.
  
  It tastes delicious by itself, but a nutritional yeast gravy might
  taste good on top. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40

      1 c  Mashed, ripe bananas
    1/3 c  Buttermilk
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans
 
  Everyone has banana bread recipes, but this one uses buttermilk which
  I thought was interesting.
  
  Banana bread is made all over the Northern Hemisphere but this recipe
  is from the South.
  
  Combine flour, soda and salt in a mixing bowl.  Cream butter with
  sugar and beat in eggs with bananas, buttermilk and vanilla. Stir
  into dry ingredients and fold in nuts. Spoon into a greased 9 x
  5-inch pan and bake in a preheated 350F oven for about an hour, or
  until bread tests done in the center.
  
  Makes 1 loaf.

      Title: SOUTHERN BISCUITS
 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Sifted, self-rising flour
    1/2 c  Lard or shortening
      1 c  Buttermilk
 
  From "A Treasury or Southern Baking" by Prudence Hilburn.
  HarperCollins; 1993.
  
  Preheat the oven to 475'F. Lightly grease a baking sheet.
  
  Put the flour in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center. Add
  the shortening (lard) and buttermilk. Start working the flour into
  the milk and shortening, squeezing the mixture through the fingers
  until a soft dough is formed. This will be a sticky dough. Lift the
  dough from the bowl and start folding, gently kneading or pressing
  with the fingertips, and turning the dough until it is no longer
  sticky. Pat the dough to a thickness of about 1/2". Cut with a 2"
  biscuit cutter. (Or instead, many Southern bakers prefer to pinch off
  small portions of dough to make balls about 1 1/2" in diameter. Roll
  balls in your palms, place on baking sheet, and press with knuckles
  to flatten slightly.) Place on baking sheet. If you want outside to
  be crispy, the biscuits should be placed about 1" apart. For a soft
  biscuit, place with edges touching. Bake for about 8 minutes, until
  lightly browned. Best served hot from the oven, with butter, if
  desired.

      3    Carrots -- sliced
      2    Yellow onions -- quartered
      2    Parsnips -- * sliced
      2 tb Fresh parsley -- chopped
    1/2 ts Black pepper
 
  ~-- Dumplings: ---- 1 1/2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
  ~- or sage 1/3 cup fresh parsley 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 large
  egg -- beaten 1/2  cup
  :        milk 1/4 teaspoon salt -- optional
  
  * The use of sliced parsnips is optional.
  
  1. Tie parsley and dill springs with thread. Cut the chicken into
  serving-sized pieces. Put the chicken and its giblets, discarding the
  liver, into very large heavy pot. Add the carrots, onions, parsnips
  (if using), pepper, chopped parsley or dill and the tied sprigs. Add
  enough water to cover all ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce
  heat and simmer for 45-60 minutes or until chicken is tender. Skim
  off the fat and foam as it rises to surface. 2. When the chicken is
  done, remove and discard the parsley and dill sprigs. Using a slotted
  spoon, place the chicken and vegetables into a bowl and keep warm in
  an oven that has been slightly heated then heat turned off. 3.
  DUMPLINGS: Place the flour into a large bowl. In another bowl, blend
  together the beaten egg, 1/3 cup chopped parsley, poultry or dried
  sage, pepper and milk. Mix well and refrigerate batter until ready to
  use. 4. Bring the broth to a boil and lower heat to keep at a slow
  boil. Drop the batter by rounded teaspoons into the broth. COVER
  tightly and simmer for 15 minutes. Do not remove lid during this
  time. 5. Remove dumplings with slotted spoon and add them to the
  chicken and vegetables. Spoon some of the broth over all and garnish
  with chopped parsley if desired.
  
  Serve immediately with the broth placed into cups for each serving.

    1/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil

           -tender green parts, sliced

           Salt and pepper to taste
           Slices of French bread;
           -toasted

MMMMM-------------------------THE PISTOU------------------------------
      8    Garlic cloves; peeled
      2 lg Bunches fresh basil; stems
           -removed, 2 cups tightly
           -packed leaves
      2 ts Coarse salt
      2 c  Parmesan cheese; finely
           -grated
      2 md Tomatoes; peeled, seeded,
           -and coarsely chopped
  1 1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
 
  *A bouquet garni is a small bundle of herbs that are tied with a
  string or placed in cheesecloth so the herbs do not fall apart or
  float around in the soup. A traditional bouquet garni contains only
  thyme, parsley, and bay leaves.  It is best made with fresh herbs and
  tied in a bundle with a short piece of string. Use about 8-10 thyme
  sprigs, 1 large bunch of parsley, 1 bay leaf.  If you don't have
  fresh thyme use 1 tsp. dried thyme.
  
  To make the soup base, heat the olive oil in a 4-quart pot over medium
  heat.  Add leeks, onion, and carrots. Stir until the leeks and onion
  turn translucent about 10 minutes. Add beans, zucchini broth, and
  bouquet garni. Bring the soup to a boil, then simmer on low heat for
  about 5 minutes, and add the pasta and green beans. Continue
  simmering for about 10 minutes until the vegetables and macaroni have
  softened. Don't season the soup until you've added the pistou, which
  is very salty. If you're not serving the soup right away, chill it as
  quickly as you can so the vegetables don't overcook.
  
  PISTOU:  Put the tomatoes and then the rest of the ingredients except
  the olive oil in the blender.  (The tomatoes go in first to provide
  liquid to get the mixture moving around.) Blend at high speed for
  about 1 minute, until the mixture turns into a paste. Transfer the
  pistou to a mixing bowl and stir in the olive oil. (The olive oil
  must be added by hand, or it will turn bitter.)
  
  At the Last Minute:  To serve, whisk half of the pistou into the hot
  soup, then season with salt if needed and pepper. Immediately ladle
  the soup into hot bowls.  Serve the French bread toasts in a basket.
  Pass the remaining pistou at the table in a bowl and let guests help
  themselves. Source: Splendid Soups by James Peterson.

  6 minutes or until the chicken is golden brown and the chicken is
  completely cooked. Remove the chicken from the oil and drain on a
  paper-lined plate. Season the chicken with Essence. Continue frying
  the remaining chicken. Carefully pour off the oil, leaving about 1/2
  cup of the oil remaining in the pan, leaving the chicken debris in
  the pan. Whisk in the remaining 12 cup of the flour and cook for 3 to
  4 minutes. Whisk in the remaining milk. Bring the liquid up to a boil
  and reduce to a simmer. Season with salt and black pepper. Cook the

  each pup well over the pot, and place on the second prepared sheet
  pan.  Repeat process until all batter is fried.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Tofu, firm
      3 tb Vogue Vegy Base
  1 1/4 c  Flour, unbleached
      2 tb Flour, gluten
      1 ts Salt
      4 tb Spice Blend

           -other oil, for frying
           Southern Country Gravy
 
   Drain and rinse the tofu. Slice it horizontally into two even
  pieces. Then cut each of these pieces into 8 cubes. Place all the
  cubes in a bowl and add 1 tbs soup base. Gently mix well and set
  aside.
  
   Stir together 1/2 cup of the unbleached flour and the remaining 2
  tbs of soup base. Set aside this breading mixture.
  
   Mix the remaining 3/4 cup of unbleached flour, gluten flour, salt and
  spice blend. Blend well so the gluten flour does not create lumps.
  Stir in the water and 1 tbs of canola oil. If the gluten flour
  creates lumps, blend the batter in a blender.
  
   Heat the oil in a deep skillet. Dip a piece of tofu into the breading
  mixture and coat it completely. Then dip it into the battter, using
  prongs. Remove and hold it above the batter for abuot 10 seconds,
  tapping it gently against the side of the bowl to release excess
  batter. Then hold about one third of the piece of tofu in the hot oil
  for about 15 secnds to sear the bottom so it won't stick to the pan.
  Release the tofu and let it completely submerge. Repeat for the other
  peices.
   Deep-fry the tofu to a light brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and
  drain on paper towels for 30 seconds. You can place the tofu in the
  oven at 250 degrees for up to 15 minutes to retain crispness.

 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Ham
 
     12 lb Ham, country cured
      3 lb Kale
      3 lb Watercress
      2 lb Cabbage, green
      1 bn Celery
      1    Pepper, hot red
      6 tb Salt
      5 tb Pepper, black
      2 tb Pepper, red
      2 tb Mustard seed
      2 tb Celery seed
      2 ts Tabasco sauce
 
  Choose a plump, thick ham with a thin layer of fat. Parboil 20
  minutes. Steam and remove all skin.  Cut greens in small pieces (1"
  to 1 1/2"). Chop celery and pepper fine. Blanch greens, celery and
  pepper in boiling water until limp; drain well.  Add seasonings and
  mix. Cool ham until you can handle it comfortably. Starting at the
  butt end of the ham, cut three lengthwise slits, 2" long, all the way
  through. Second row--two slits. Third row--three slits, so that one
  slit for stuffing does not split into another. The ham is now ready
  to be stuffed. With your fingers, push the seasoned greens into slits
  first from the top, then from underneath, until you can feel all the
  spaces have been filled. The remaining greens are banked over the top
  of the ham.
  
  To keep the ham in shape, use a large square of clean cloth. Place
  ham, skin side up, on the cloth, fold the ends over tightly and pin.
  Return to ham boiler and simmer 15 minutes to the pound. Let cool for
  two hours in the pot liquor.  Chill in refrigerator overnight, in its
  cloth.

      Title: SOUTHERN POACHED PEARS WITH GENTLEMEN JACK SA
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8    Pears with stems(Bartlett)
    1/4 c  Brown sugar, dark, packed
    1/4 c  Gentleman Jack Rare Whiskey
    3/4 c  Vanilla ice milk
      1    Mint leaves for garnish
      1    Strawberries, sliced (opt)
 
  Servings: 6
  
  Carefully peel pears, leaving stems intact.  Place in pot or saucepan
  large enough to hold all 8 pears and cover with water. Add brown
  sugar and slowly bring to a boil. Reudce heat and simmer about 8 to
  10 minutes or until pears can be easily pierced with a fork.  Do not
  overcook or they will become mushy.  Remove from heat and allow to
  cool in the poaching liquid. Cover and refrigerate several hours or
  overnight.
  
  Remove pears from liquid, reserving liquid.  Place liquid on the
  stove, bring to a boil and boil until liquid is reduced in volume to
  1 cup. When reduced, set aside and allow to cool.
  
  While liquid is reducing, halve the pears lengthwise, leaving the
  stems attached to one half of each pear. Carefully remove the core of
  each pear half, taking care to leave pears intact. Set the six most
  attractive pear halves with stems attached and their "mates" aside.
  
  Remove the stems from the two remaining pear halves and place with
  their two mates in a blender container. Pour the reduced poaching
  liquid and Gentleman Jack Rare Tennessee Whiskey into the container
  with the pears and puree until smooth.  Makes about 2 cups puree. (At
  this point the pear halves and puree can be covered and refrigerated
  until ready to serve.)
  
  To serve, divide half of the puree equally among each of six plates,
  pouring a little sauce on the bottom of each plate. Place a pear half
  with stem attached, cavity side down, on each plate on top of puree.
  With a sharp knife, starting about 1/2-inch from the stem end,
  carefully make slices in the pear half all the way through the
  opposite end and about 1/4 inch apart. Fan the slices apart by
  pressing gently on them until the ends separate slightly.
  
  Place remaining pear halves without stems, cavity side up, next to
  each fanned pear half.  Fill cavity with a 1-ounce (2 tablespoon)
  scoop of ice milk.  Place a mint leaf beside each pear stem for
  garnish. Add a few slices of strawberry for color, if desired.
  
  Serves 6.  Each serving contains approximately 210 calories, 2 mg

      Title: SOUTHERN STYLE PORK CHOPS
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Pork chops,
           -about 1/2 inch
           Shortening or oil
      4    Onion slices (we
           -like these fairly thick)
    1/4 c  Peanut butter
    1/4 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Mushroom soup, condensed
           -(or make a mushroom-
           -flavored white sauce)
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Black pepper
 
  In a frying pan big enough to hold all of the chops at once, brown
  pork chops on both sides in a little shortening or oil. Pour off fat,
  leaving chops in frying pan. Place an onion slice on top of each chop.
  
  Mix peanut butter, mushroom soup, milk, Worcestershire sauce, salt and
  pepper. Pour over chops. Cover and simmer over medium to low heat for
  45 minutes. You may want to move the chops around in the pan from
  time to time to keep them from sticking.
  
  Smooth peanut butter is best.  The chunky variety gives a strange
  consistency to this dish.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pork chops in mushroom peanut-butter sauce -- I originally found
  this recipe in the "Woman's Day Encyclopedia of Cookery." It is very
  easy to prepare and makes a hearty main dish served over rice or
  noodles.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes browning, 45 minutes simmering.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  I fix this (and double it) to take to pot luck lunches; today it is
  on its way to a dog show. I like to have it once a month anyway. It
  has great flavor and it is a complete meal. Great for a cool summer
  dinner.
  
  Bring 2 cups of water and 1 cup of chicken broth to boil in a heavy
  medium sauce pan. Add rice. Season with salt and pepper; reduce heat
  to low. Cover and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed,
  about 20 minutes. Tranfer rice to large bowl and cool.
  
  Preheat broiler. Place chicken on heavy broilerproof pan. Brush
  chicken with 1/2 tbs of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper
  sprinkle with 1 tsp. cumin. Broil chicken until cooked through, about
  10 minutes. Cool and cut into 1 inch pieces.
  
  Add chicken, black beans, corn, bell pepper, red onion and cilantro
  to rice in boil.  Combine remaining 1/4 cup chicken broth, remaining
  tablespoon olive oil, remaining teaspoon cumin, lime juice and garlic
  in blender. Process until garlic is finely minced. Season to taste

      4    Whole green onions
      1 c  Pecan halves
      4 c  Cold cooked white rice
      3 tb Cooking oil
    1/2 c  Cilantro

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONING------------------------------
      3    Cloves garlic, finely minced

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2    Dried ancho chiles
    1/3 c  Tomato sauce
    1/4 c  Rice wine or sherry
      3 tb Oyster sauce
      2 tb Dark sesame oil
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 tb White wine vinegar
      2 ts SW style or asian chile
           Sauce
 
  Advance preparation: Preheat the oven to 325. In a small bowl, beat
  the eggs with a fork and refrigerate. Discard the seeds and stem from
  the bell pepper, and then cut the pepper into 1/4 inch cubes. Discard
  the stem ends from the zucchini, and then cut the zucchini on a sharp
  diagonal into 1/4 inch thick slices. Overlap the zucchini slices and
  cut into 1/4 inch matchstick pieces, place the pieces together and
  cut into 1/4 inch cubes. Discard the corn husks and cut the kernels
  off the cob. Cut the green onions on a sharp diagonal into 1/4 inch
  long pieces. In a small bowl, combine all the vegetables and
  refrigerate. Toast the pecans in the preheated oven for 15 minutes,
  and then set aside. Place the cold cooked rick in a plastic bag and
  squeeze the bag with fingers to separate the rice into individual
  grains. Divide the cooking oil, putting 1 T in one small container
  and 2 T in another. Set aside the cilantro. In a small container; set
  aside the garlic. Place the ancho chiles in a small bowl and cover
  the chiles with boiling water. When the chiles soften, mince the
  chiles finely. In a small bowl, combine the minced chiles with the
  remaining sauce ingredients.
  
  Final cooking steps: Chop the fresh cilantro and set aside. Place a
  wok over the highest heat. When the wok becomes very hot, add 1 T of
  the oil to the center. Roll the oil around the wok and when the oil
  gives off just a wisp of smoke, add the eggs. Stir and toss the eggs
  until they are softly scrambled, then slide them onto a plate.
  Immediately return the wok to the highest heat. Add the remaining
  cooking oil and the garlic. Stir-fry the garlic, and soon as it turns
  white, about 5 seconds, add the vegetables. Stir and toss the
  vegetables until the peppers brighten, about 1 minute. Stir the
  sauce. Add the sauce, scrambled eggs, and pecans to the wok. Stir and
  toss all the ingredients until they are mixed evenly and the rice is
  thoroughly reheated, about 3 minutes. Stir in the cilantro. Taste and
  adjust the seasonings.

  straight-sided oven-safe quiche dish. (We use two with fluted sides.)
  Pull crust gently into place and flute with fingers. Pour egg mixture
  into dish. Bake for approximately 45 minutes until top is nicely
  brown and quiche does not "give" when pressed with a gentle finger.
  Serve hot, sliced into 8 pieces; or wrap tightly in plastic wrap,
  refrigerate and use as much as one week later. Serves
    8. NOTE This recipe can be made "guilt free" by substituting Egg
  Beaters, skim milk, low-fat cheese, non-creamed corn (drained),
  salt-substitute and margarine. Suggested accompaniments: Salsa (ours
  is home-made), any type of hot sauce (we serve both red and green
  Tobasco), sour cream and/or more green chile.JM.

  with sliced melon, and serve it with home-fried potatoes with
  pimiento and green pepper, our piquant Southwest-style cornbread, and

      Title: SOUTHWEST SALAD WITH BLACK BEANS & CORN
 Categories: Miamiherald, Vegetarian, Vegan, Salads
      Yield: 6 To 8 serve
 
MMMMM-----------------FORMATTED BY LISA CRAWFORD----------------------
      2 c  Dried black beans or
      4 c  Canned black beans; drained
      3 cl Garlic; minced
    1/2 c  Heaping red onion
      1 md Red bell pepper; cored,
           -seeded and minced
      1 md Carrot; minced (opt)
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
    1/2 c  Fresh lime juice(3-4 limes)
      2    To 3 ts whole cumin seeds
    1/2 c  Minced fresh cilantro
    1/2 c  Minced fresh parsley
    1/2 c  Minced fresh basil
      1 ts Crushed red pepper
           Freshly ground black pepper
      3    To 4 corn tortillas (opt)
 
  Soak the beans for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight. Drain
  off any excess soaking water, place the soaked beans in a soup pot
  and cover with fresh water. Bring just to a boil, then cover abd turn
  the heat way down.  Cook at a very slow simmer until beans are
  tender, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.  Check form time to time to be sure
  there is enough water and add more if necessary. When the beans are
  cooked, drain them well. Then rinse thoroughly in cold water and
  drain them well again. In a large bowl, combine beans, corn, garlic,
  onion, bell pepper, carrot if using, salt, olive oil and lime juice.
  Roast the whole cumin seeds in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat,
  stirring several minutes. Add the toasted seeds to the salad, along
  with the cilantro, parsley, basil and red and black pepper to taste
  and mix thoroughly but gently. If using tortillas, lightly brush both
  sides with olive oil and cut tortillas into strips approximately 1/4
  inch wide and 1 1/2 inches long. Cook the strips slightly by tasoting
  them in a 350-degree oven or toaster oven for about 2 minutes or in a
  heavy skillet over medium heat for 2-3 minutes. They should be partly
  crispy and pastly chewy.  Stir these into the salad shortly before
  serving or scatter them on top as a garnish.

  The American Insitute of Wine and Food has a booklet of recipes
  developed by top chefs and nutritionists. Review by Loretta Scott of
  the Riverside Press Enterprise, who tested this recipe. "Be sure to
  roast or boil the mushrooms and tomatoes, as directed. It adds flavor
  to the finished stew." "Somehow I forgot to add the cheese the first
  time around; the stew was even better with the cheese the next day."

      2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 tb Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
      4 oz Diced canned green chilies (
    1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
    3/4 c  Milk
      1 pn Black or cayenne pepper
 
  HEAT THE OVEN TO 450F. Combine flour, baking powder, salt and pepper
  in a large mixing bowl. Cut in the vegetable shortening using a
  pastry blender or two knives until the mixture has the consistency of
  coarse crumbs. Add the chilies, cheese and milk, adding more milk if
  necessary so the dough is pliable but is still wet. Turn the dough
  onto a heavily floured surface, and knead it lightly (8 to 10 times).
  Do not overwork the dough. Roll the dough to an even thickness of
  3/4-to-1 inch, and cut out biscuits with a 2-inch round cutter (the
  diameter of a juice can), dipping the cutter in flour between cutting
  each biscuit so they do not stick. Place the biscuits on an ungreased
  cookie sheet and bake in the center of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes,
  or until golden brown. Serve immediately, or bake up to 2 hours in
  advance and reheat for 5 minutes in a 300F oven. Makes 12 to 14.

  Soak the pinto beans in water overnight, or about 6-8 hours. Drain the
  water and rinse the beans well.
  
  Simmer the ham hock for about 2 hours in enough water to cover; about
  2 quarts. (You could also use a pound of side pork or slab bacon cut
  into 1 inch chunks.) Remove the meat from the hock and return it to
  the cooking pot. Add the pre-soaked and rinsed beans to the pot,
  along with the rest of the ingredients. Add enough water or tomato
  juice to bring the level to about 4 1/2 quarts total volume. Cover
  and simmer for about 4 hours, or longer if you have a slow cooker.
  Watch the liquid level while cooking so the beans don't get too dry.
  
  Adjust the hot peppers to suit your taste.

    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
      2 c  Celery; finely chopped

    1/2 c  Sweet red pepper; chopped
    1/2 c  Green pepper; chopped
      1 ea (8 oz) package herb-seasoned
           -stuffing mix
      2 ea (10-3/4 oz) cans condensed
           -chicken broth, undiluted
  2 1/4 c  Water
      2 lg Eggs
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground red pepper
           Garnishes: sweet red pepper
           -strips, celery leaves
 
     Prepare cornbread according to package directions; cool and
  crumble into a large bowl.  Set aside.
     Cook cumin seeds in a heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring
  constantly, 3 minutes or until seeds are more fragrant and lightly
  browned. Cool seeds and crush; set aside.
     Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; add celery and next 3
  ingredients, and cook, stirring constantly, until tender.
     Stir celery mixture, crushed cumin, stuffing mix, and next 5
  ingredients into crumbled cornbread.
     Spoon into a lightly greased 13" x 9" x 2" baking dish.
     Bake at 350F for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
  Garnish, if desired.  Yield: 8 servings.
  
  On a Lighter Side:
     To save 51 calories and 8.1 fat grams per serving, prepare
  cornbread mix using egg substitute and nonfat buttermilk. Substitute
  2 tablespoons reduced-calorie margarine for the 1/4 cup butter.
  Substitute 5 cups plus 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium, ready-to-serve,
  fat-free chicken broth for condensed chicken broth and water, and 1/2
  cup egg substitute for eggs. Instead of greasing the baking dish,
  coat it with vegetable cooking spray. Bake at 350F for 1 hour and 5
  minutes. This version makes a firmer textured dressing than the
  original.

  Goa has developed its own cuisine and vindaloo is one of its main

  chiles in vinegar for 15 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and blend
  into a puree. Scrape mixture into a small bowl. Add cumin, coriander
  and cinnamon and mix thoroughly.  Coat duck pieces well with spice
  paste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Heat oil in a
  large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add duck pieces and brown on
  all sides. Add salt, water, sugar and any remaining spice puree.
  Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until duck
  is tender, about 1 hour. Skim off all fat. Transfer duck to a heated

      Title: SOUVLAKI WITH TZAZIKI
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------SOUVLAKI-------------------------------
      2 lb Lamb shoulder;-OR-
           -Sirloin tip;cut in 1 1/2"
           -chunks
      2 c  Red wine;dry
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 ts Oregano;dried
      2 ts Lemon rind;long strips up to
           -3 tsp
    1/4 c  Olive oil
           -Sweet peppers and cherry
           -tomatoes as needed

MMMMM--------------------------TZAZIKI-------------------------------
      2 c  Yogurt;pain
    1/2    Cucumber;English,peeled &
           -grated
      2    Garlic cloves;minced
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 ts -salt
 
  "Begin preparing the tzazik a few hours before serving. The flavours
  need time to blend. Marinate the meat overnight to absorb the wine
  and garlic." SOUVLAKI: Place the meat in a large bowl. Pour in the
  wine and sprinkle minced garlic and oregano. Imbed the lemon strips
  among the cubes of meat and drizzle with olive oil. Cover tightly
  with plastic wrap and refrigerate 12 hours or overnight. Shake or
  stir the mixture several times during the marination period.
    About 30 minutes before serving, drain off and discard the marinade.
  Thread the chunks of meat onto long skewers, brushing with a little
  olive oil. (We usually BBQ the peppers and tomatoes on separate
  skewers but it's really up to the chef.)
    Over medium coals, barbeque the souvlaki until it's done the way
  you like it. Serve on a bed of rice and pass the tzaziki to spoon on
  top. SERVES 4-6 TZAZIKI: Line a colander or sieve with cheesecloth
  (or gauze) and set it over a bowl. Pour in the yogurt and allow it to
  drip for an hour or so. After the yogurt has drained, combine it, in
  a small bowl, with the cucumber and the garlic. Cover the bowl
  tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until just before serving.
  While the meat is BBQing, drizzle the olive oil over the surface, and
  without stirring, sprinkle on the salt. It needs no mixing - your
  guest will do that when they dollop it onto their souvlaki. MAKES:
  About 3 cups

      Title: SOY SAUCE
 Categories: Info/tips, Mine
      Yield: 1 Info/tips
 
 
  While Americans are familiar with soy sauce, most aren't aware that
  there are different types, nor do they understand how to use them.
  China and Japan are the major producers of authentic soy sauce and
  companies in each country make their own very different style of the
  condiment. Within each major style, there are also light, dark, and
  even "lite' soy sauces.
  
  No matter the style, all soy sauce begins with soybeans, wheat and
  mold. A combination of roasted soybean meal and ground wheat is
  injected with aspergillus mold and left to develop for several days.
  The cultured meal is then mixed with brine and yeast and transferred
  to tanks where it ferments for anywhere from six months to four
  years, depending on the manufacturer. The liquids are then drained
  off, strained and bottled.
  
  Japanese manufacturer use more wheat than the Chinese to make their
  soy sauce and this accounts for its mellowere,. less salty flavor.
  Dark soy, with its deep brown color and soft, fruity aroma, is the
  type used most often in Japan. Japanese light soy spends less time in
  fermentation tanks and is paler, with a milder flavor than the dark.
  Cooks from southwestern Japan, wher the cuisine is very light and
  delicate, favor it because it adds flavor but not color.
  
  Chines-style soy sauces are generally saltier nad have a much stronger
  flavor than the sweeter, mellower Japanese soy sauces. The Chinese
  sauces range from very thickm dark, paste-like mixtures to some that
  are quite thin and lightly colored. A bit of molasses gives their
  dark soy a slightly sweet flavor. The Chines also make mushroom soy
  sauce, which is dark soy sauce flavored with straw mushrooms.
  
  In both countries, light soy sauces are saltier than dark. An easy
  way to distinguish between the two is to shake the bottle. Dark soy
  sauce will coat the sides of the bottle; the more watery light soy
  won't.
  
  Tamari sauce is made much the same way as soy sauce is but without
  wheat. Some find its flavor unpleasantly metallic. Reduced-sodium soy
  sauces are just an excuse for health food store to charge ridiculous
  prices. If you're sensitive to sodium, you'll get more flavor by
  simply diluting a good-quality soy sauce with water, broth, or wine
  than by buying a more expensive "lite" product which has little taste.
  
  Avoid artificially produced soy sauces that are invading grocery
  shelves. Unlike Japanese or chinese companies that brew their soy
  sauce according to the centuries-old process, American manufactureres
  often take shortcuts, mixing soy protein with water, corn syrup, salt
  and caramel color to produce a harsh, salty liquids that has none of
  the complexity and richness of a good-quality soy sauce. To be sure
  you're getting authentic brands, look for the words "naturally
  brewed" on the label.
  
  The deep color and strong sweet-salty taste of Chinese dark soy sauce
  is well paired with hearty foods that won't be overwhelmed by its
  powerful color and flavor. Meats and "red-cooked" dishes, in which
  foods are braised slowly to develop an appetizing reddish brown
  color, are good choices for dark soy sauce. Light Chinese soy sauce
  is well matched with more subtly flavored foods, such as seafood,
  vegetables and poultry dishes. Use it, too, for dipping sauces and
  marinades. While Chines-style soy sauces are indispensable in some
  traditional recioes, they're certainly not to everyone's taste, and
  they'll overwhelm the flavor of subtler Japanese and Southeast Asian
  dishes. Mushroom soy sauce, often used to flavor meat or vegetable
  stir-fries, is delicious, but its flavor is quite potent. Use it
  sparingly.
  
  Japanese dark soy sauce is the most versatile for Western dishes as
  well as for traditional Asian food. Kikkoman is a good all-purpose
  soy sauce. Made by a Japanese company in Wisconsin, this
  Japanese-style soy sauce has a well-rounded, complex flavor with a
  slightly sweet aftertaste. Recommended for all types of cooking.

      Title: SOY YOGURT
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 qt Soy milk
      2 ts Yogurt
 
  Place inverted, clean jars in a pot of water. Bring the water to a
  boil and let it boil for at least 2 minutes. Throw in the caps and a
  clean rubber spatula to be used to   stir in the starter later. Heat
  the soymilk to a boil and    hold for 30 seconds, stirring
  constantly. Pour into the hot sterile jars. Cover, Let cool to about
  110 degrees, or until the jar feels hot to your wrist, but doesn't
  burn.
       Add 2 T yogurt to each quart. Stir briskly with
  :         sterilized spatula, cover and incubate for 2-6 hours at
  approximately 105 degrees. It is done if it separates easily and
  cleanly from the jar sides when you tilt the jar gently. It can also
  be made in a pressure cooker. Bring milk to a  boil for 30 seconds.
  Put the lid and jiggler on the pot and set in a sink of cold water to
  cool. Check in about 10-15    minutes. Shake the pot a few times to
  evenly distribute the heat of the soymilk. Remove the lid. The
  soymilk should be about 110 degrees. Stir in starter with a
  sterilized spoon, replace the lid and jiggler and incubate. Put jars
  or        presure cooker in a warm place such as a gas oven with a
     pilot light, or a closed insulated picnic cooler box with a drop
  light turned on inside. Or you can put the jars in a 150 degree oven
  for 3 minutes. Turn the oven off and let the yogurt incubate,
  undisturbed, for 2-6 hours.

  Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. In large bowl,
  combine flour, 1/4 tsp salt and nutmeg. By hand, beat eggs into flour
  mixture. Gradually adding milk, stirring constantly until mixture
  forms a smooth, soft, moist dough. If dough is too thick, add

  In large pot, bring water and remaining salt to a boil. Press spaetzle
  dough, a small amount at a time, through colander with large holes

    1/4 ts Nutmeg (optional)
      4    Eggs; Large, Beaten
    1/2 c  (or more) Water

  elastic and stiff. Using a spaetzle machine or a colander with medium
  holes, press the noodles into a large pot full of boiling salted
  water. Cook noodles in the water about 5 minutes or until they rise
  to the surface. Lift noodles out and drain on paper towels.  Brown
  noodles in melted butter over low heat, and serve with a main dish.
  Or, don't bother browning them, and serve in/with soup, or with stew.
  
  (Another method for shaping the noodles is to spread the mixture on a
  wooden board and cut off little pieces, dropping them in the boiling
  water and fishing them out quickly when they're done.)
  
  (Be prepared to write off your first few attempts at spaetzle, by the
  way.) They are very labor-intensive, and a little miscalculation with
  the time in the hot water can ruin them.

      2 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Butter
      4    Garlic cloves, peeled
           -and lightly crushed
    1/4 c  White wine, dry

           -freshly grated
           Black pepper,
           -freshly ground
      2 tb Parsley, chopped fine
 
  Cut the pancetta or bacon into thin strips.
  
  Put the oil, butter and crushed garlic into a saucepan or small saute
  pan and turn on the heat to medium-high. When the garlic becomes
  colored a deep gold, remove and discard it.
  
  Put the pancetta or bacon into the pan and saute until it begins to be
  crisp at the edges. Add the wine and let it boil away for a minute or
  two; then turn off the heat.
  
  In a large pot, bring about 4-5 quarts water to a boil. Add about 2-3
  T salt, and when the water returns to a boil, put in the spaghetti.
  
  Take the bowl from which you'll be serving the spaghetti later, and
  into it break the three eggs. Beat them lightly, then mix into them
  both grated cheeses, a liberal grinding of pepper, and the parsley.
  
  When the spaghetti is tender but firm to the bite, drain it and put
  it into the serving bowl with the egg-and-cheese mixture. toss
  rapidly and thoroughly until it is well-coated.
  
  Reheat the pancetta or bacon quickly over high heat, then pour the
  entire contents of the pan over the spaghetti. Toss again thoroughly
  and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spaghetti with raw eggs and Italian bacon -- While there are
  innumerable minor variations in the way people make this celebrated
  Roman dish, there are really only two substantially different schools
  of thought. One maintains that pancetta, a mild, cured, unsmoked
  Italian bacon, is the only correct bacon to use. The other school
  insists on the smoked American variety. Both are good, and both are
  popular in Italy, but the version I prefer is the one with pancetta.
  The flavor of smoke is not usually associated with Italian food;
  certainly hardly ever outside of Alto Adige, a German-speaking region
  in the North that was once part of Austria. In this dish, I find that
  smoked bacon adds a sharpness that wearies the palate after the first
  bite-fulls. Try it both ways and decide for yourself.

      1 lb Bacon cooked and crumbled
      1 md Onion, diced
      1    Green pepper, diced
      1 sm Clove garlic crushed
      2 tb Bacon fat fom above

MMMMM---------------------------PASTA--------------------------------
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Olive oil
      2    Eggs
      2 tb Water
 
  Saute the onion and pepper. Cook pasta and drain. Add pepper, onion
  and bacon Add 2 eggs and stir over med heat until egg starts to cook.
  You don't want the eggs to become scrambled. It should be on the
  creamy side. Add pepper and parmesan to taste. PASTA: Mix the flour,
  salt and olive oil, then beat in the eggs, (a food processor, or a
  mixmaster does this very easily). When well combined, add all of the
  water. Work until this becomes a dough ball, and then knead for two
  minutes, stretching out the dough, and folding it. Put in a plastic
  bag, and store in the fridge for at least a half an hour. Divide the
  dough into four pieces, and run through the machine, adding flour
  (this is a good place to work in some semolina) so that the dough is
  not sticky. After kneading on the widest setting for about 10/15
  passes, reduce the size of the roller one step at a time until you
  reach the thinnest size. Put through the cutter of your choice, and
  dry on a rack or a line. Use fresh, or freeze unused portions. Easy,
  and quick and impresses the hell out of your guests! I sometimes add
  thyme, or oregano to my dough when mixing (about 2 t) and this adds
  nicely to the taste of the dough.

 Categories: Pastas
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
  Olive oil, about 1/2 cup per serving Sliced garlic cloves, as many as
  you dare Pasta Grated parmesan and romano cheese
  
  Warm the olive oil.  Brown the sliced garlic cloves until crispy. Let
  the whole thing stay warm while cooking the pasta, then toss all
  together -- quick meal. The original recipe called for discarding the
  garlic slices, but we like them because they are really nice and
  crunchy. Top with plenty of grated parmesan and romano cheese!
  
  Note:  you could easily add peppers and then mushrooms at the end.

 Categories: Beef, Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground Beef
      1    Onion -- chopped
      2    To 3 Cloves Garlic -- minced
      2    15-Oz Cans Tomato Sauce
      2    6-Oz Cans Tomato Paste
      1 tb Italian Seasoning -- or
           More
      1 ds Ground Oregano
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black Pepper
      1    Or 2 Glugs White Wine
 
  Brown the beef and onion in a huge skillet.  Add the garlic when the
  beef is almost done.  Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste and all
  the seasonings. Simmer over low heat while you cook the pasta. Like I
  said, about 15 minutes before you're ready to serve, stir the wine
  into the sauce.
  
  I've never found it necessary to let spaghetti sauce cook for hours
  and hours.  I don't have the time or the patience, and I like my
  spaghetti sauce better than anything canned/jarred, or ordered in a
  restaurant. It's got a richer taste, what with the amount of tomato
  paste I use. Sometimes I use a can of stewed tomatoes in place of one
  of the tomato sauces, but that's about the only variation I ever make.

      Yield: 25 Servings
 
      8 qt Plum or paste tomatoes,
           Coarse dice -- measure after
           Dice
      4 tb Oregano -- dry
      2 tb Basil -- dry
      2 tb Parsely -- dry
      1 tb Paprika
      1 tb Sugar
      1    Head garlic, minced (about 3
           To 4 tbsp) -- NOT 1 clove
      3 md Onions -- coarse chop
      2 md Bell pepper -- coarse chop
      2 tb Oil -- olive or other
 
  Dip tomatoes a few at a time in boiling water for 30 seconds, then
  place in cool water.  The skins will slip right off.
  
  Chop coarsely and put in enamelware or stainless pot big enough to
  hold the 8 quarts of tomatoes and other ingredients. Add spices and
  bring to a boil, simmering about 10 minutes. Substitute fresh
  herbs/spices if you have them. Adjust for personal taste.
  
  Mince the garlic and coarsely chop the onion and bell pepper; sautee
  until just soft in the oil.
  
  Add to the tomato mixture and simmer another 10 minutes or so. Do not
  over cook; remember, there will be further cooking during the canning
  proccess and when reheating at final use.
  
  Prepare canning jars per manufacturers instructions. It is now
  recommended that when canning tomato products additional acid be
  added. My canner instructions call for 2 tbsp of bottled (not fresh)
  lemon juice per quart of product. Put this in jar before the sauce. I
  also add 1 tsp salt per quart. Proccess in pressure canner as
  directed.
  
  This recipe produces enough sauce for 7 quarts and enough left over
  for one plate of pasta for the cook!

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Heat olive oil in large Dutch oven.  Add anchovies and stir together
  until oil and anchovies make a paste. Add the tomatoes, liquid and
  all. Break up the tomatoes and cook for 2 hours, then add the basil,
  oregano and half the garlic.  Cook for 6 to 8 hours, adding a little
  water as needed. The sauce will become a dark, rich red. In the last
  half hour, add the remaining garlic, olives and capers.  Cook for a
  few minutes to blend the flavors. Serve over pasta and pass grated
  Parmesan.
  
  The editors wrote: "Anchovies, capers, olives and garlic result in a
  mysterious and wholly Italian taste experience that even anchovy
  haters tend to like. This recipe was...the best of several on this
  theme. We would only suggest the possibility of adding the fresh
  herbs later in the cooking process."

      1 lg Bay leaf
           Pinch each thyme, rosemary
           Lots parmesan cheese
      2    Slices american cheese
 
  In a dutch oven, brown the sausages well (still in their casings) in a
  little olive oil.  Use tongs to remove sausage to top of pot lid.
  Drain off fat if necessary, leaving about 1 tbs in pot. Toss in
  onion, green pepper and garlic and stir to coat, scraping up the
  brown bits from bottom of pot. Let cook for about 2 minutes, just
  'til the onion and pepper begin to soften (do not brown).  Return
  sausage to pot and stir in tomatoes or sauce, paste, sugar, wine,
  seasonings and parmesan. Simmer for 45-60 minutes.  Meanwhile, saute
  mushrooms in a dab of butter, dash of olive oil, sprinkle of marjoram
  or basil and paprika. Add the mushrooms and any juice in the pan to
  the saucepot during last 15 minutes of cooking. Add optional american
  cheese a few minutes before serving, let melt & stir in. This really
  mellows out the sauce Tips: You can brown pork shoulder blades or
  spareribs along with the sausage. Gives a great flavor and provides a
  2nd meat course if you're having company.  Use more or less wine,
  depending on whether you're using whole tomatoes or sauce. Just aim
  for a nice thick sauce. Leftovers make great sausage sandwiches. I
  freeze mine a lot for quick meals later.

 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 lg Onions; finely chopped
      2 tb Olive oil
     75 g  Crme fraiche
           -OR thick set yogurt
    175 g  Spaghetti
     25 g  Parmesan, grated
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  A simple sauce of sweated onions, sweet and soft, goes really well on
  spaghetti. Lots of freshly ground black pepper, Parmesan, and some
  crme fraiche or yogurt make it a memorable dish.
  
  Cook the onions in the olive oil over a very gentle heat, covered,
  for 30 minutes, stirring from time to time until they are soft,
  transparent and sweet but not browned. Season with a little salt and
  lots of freshly ground black pepper. Cool a little, then stir in the
  crme fraiche.
  
  Meanwhile cook the spaghetti 'al dente' and drain it. Pour the sauce
  over the top and toss well together. Serve with the grated cheese.

      Title: SPAGHETTI SQUASH & ZUCCHINI CASSEROLE
 Categories: Vegetarian, Casseroles
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Spaghetti squash
           (if more than 2 lbs -- use
           Half)
      1 md Zucchini grated
      1 c  Tomato sauce OR
      6 oz Can tomato paste +
      2 oz Water
      1 ts Finely cut fresh basil
      1 ts Dried crushed oregano
      1 ts Garlic powder or
      4    Cloves finely chopped fresh
    1/4 ts Ground black pepper
    1/4 ts Salt (optional)
           Serrano chili sauce or
           Other hot sauce to taste
           (optional)
 
  (This dish requires 20 minutes of baking, but the first part of the
  preparation of the spaghetti squash can be done stovetop or
  microwave.) Cut spaghetti squash in half length-wise. Carefuly scrape
  out seeds, but do not cut into the body of the squash. While the
  squash is cooking you can prepare the other ingredients.
  
  Stovetop: place half squash cut side down in a pot with 2" (5 cm)
  water, cover and boil for 20 minutes. Microwave: place half squash in
  a dish with 1/4 cup water, cover with plastic wrap and cook at high
  (>600 watts) for 7 minutes.
  
  Squash is half cooked. With fork, scrape out squash to produce
  spaghetti-like strands. A thin, hard shell will be left.
  
  In a large bowl, add spaghetti squash, tomato sauce, grated zucchini
  and spices. Mix well and spoon into squash shell (or casserole dish),
  top with nutritional yeast, a little more garlic powder (and, if
  desired, non-fat grated parmesan cheese).
  
  Bake at 350 degrees F. (175 C.) for 20 minutes or until done.
  
  Serves 6. Each 8 oz (.25 l.) serving has 66 calories, less than 0.25
  g fat.
  
  (This recipe was adapted from a sticker attached to a spaghetti
  squash by Linden Associated Growers, Linden, CA.) This took about 8
  minutes of working time, 7 minutes of microwaving while getting the
  rest ready, and then waiting 20 minutes while it baked. Smell and
  taste was delicious.
  
  I served it with brown rice and fresh non-fat French Bread. It would
  be an ideal filling for a pita pocket or tortilla.
  
  What to do with the other half of the squash?  Stick it in the
  refrigerator for a few days, then prepare it as shown above, except
  microwave for 10 minutes or boil for 30, and then scrape it out and
  serve topped with your favorite spaghetti sauce. kwvegan vegan

           None
 
  In answer to how to prepare spaghetti squash, I found this in the
  June, 94 issue of Southern Living:
  
  GARDEN-FRESH "PASTA"
  
  The flesh of spaghetti squash, when cooked, comes out like strands of
  cooked spaghetti and makes a great light stand-in for pasta lovers.
  
  Prepare squash by cutting in half lengthwise and removing seeds.
  Pierce skin several times with a fork and follow one of the cooking
  methods below.
  
  To bake, prepare squash, and place, cut side down, in a large baking
  pan. Bake at 350 oF for 45 minutes or until skin is tender and
  strands may be loosened easily with a fork.
  
  To microwave, prepare squash, and place, cut side down, in a baking
  dish. Add 1/4 cup water; cover with plastic wrap, folding back a
  small edge of wrap to allow steam to escape. Cook on HIGH 7 to 10
  minutes.
  
  To boil, prepare squash, and place, cut side down, in a Dutch oven,
  add water to a depth of 2 inches. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce
  heat, and simmer 20 to 25 minutes or until tender. Drain.
  
  Cool cooked squash. Using a fork, remove spaghetti-like strands of
  pulp. Discard shell.
  
  Yield: 1 medium spaghetti squash equals about 4 cups cooked.

 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    175 g  Spaghetti
           -- cooked 'al dente'
           Salt and pepper
           Garlic crotons
           - See Courgettes Provenale
           Grated cheese to garnish

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE SAUCE----------------------------
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 md Onion; finely sliced
      1    Garlic clove; crushed
      2 tb Fresh mixed herbs
           - (finely chopped)
    400 g  Canned tomatoes
 
  A home-made tomato sauce, with the freshness of herbs and garlic, is
  an unbeatable rival to any commercial variety. This version of a
  classic spaghetti dish is sprinkled with garlic crotons and is
  utterly mouthwatering.
  
  Heat the oil in a large pan and gently cook the onion in it, stirring
  until it softens but not allowing it to brown. After about 6-7
  minutes, stir in the crushed garlic and the herbs, and cook together
  for a further 5 minutes. Add the juices from the can of tomatoes and
  simmer together for 5 minutes more. Chop the tomatoes and add them to
  the pan, season to taste, and pour the sauce over the hot, drained
  spaghetti. Top with garlic crotons. Serve at once, on warm plates,
  with grated cheese to sprinkle over the top.

      Title: SPAGHETTI WITH SALMON & SORREL (OR SPINACH)
 Categories: Seafood, Pasta
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      4 oz Cooked and flaked salmon
      1 oz Fresh sorrel (or spinach) *
      2 oz Broccoli florets
      8 oz Fresh spaghetti
           Lemon juice and butter
      2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
 
  *Note: Amount given for sorrel (or spinach) is for trimmed weight.
  
  Take some sorrel or spinach leaves and roll them up tightly, a few at
  a time.  Snip across with scissors to make fine green ribbony shreds.
  Chop the broccoli florets into very small pieces indeed, and bring a
  large pan of salted water to the boil for cooking the pasta.
  
  Melt 2 oz butter in a flameproof casserole suitable for bringing to
  table. Add the broccoli, stir to coat with fat, cover with a lid and
  cook gently for just 1 minute. Add a very generous grinding of
  pepper, some salt and 2 teaspoons lemon juice (or quite a bit more
  lemon if using spinach). Shake the casserole to distribute the
  flavourings, then scatter the flaked fish over the broccoli but do
  not stir it in.  Cover and leave over very gentle heat for just 3
  minutes or so. Meanwhile cook the pasta.
  
  Draw the casserole away from the heat.  Add the well drained pasta,
  the Parmesan and most of the sorrel or spinach ribbons. Toss quickly,
  gently and thoroughly so that every strand of pasta is anointed with
  butter and prettily flecked with the pink and green of the salmon and
  vegetables. Check the seasoning, sprinkle the remaining ribbons of
  greenery over the top and serve straight away, accompanied by wedges
  of lemon instead of the ubiquitous bowl of grated Parmesan cheese.

 Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Sun-dried tomatoes
     16 oz Spaghetti
    1/2 c  Onion, diced
    1/2 c  Celery, diced
    1/2 c  Carrots, diced
    1/2 c  Red bell pepper, diced
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Zucchini, diced
    1/2 c  Eggplant, peeled & seeded,
           -- diced
  1 1/2 ts Garlic, minced
    1/2 c  Mushrooms, diced
      2 c  Roma tomatoes, diced
    1/4 lb Tofu, firm, diced
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Garlic, granulated
      2 ts Basil
      1 ts Rosemary
 
  Soak sun-dried tomatoes in boiling water until soft, about 10
  minutes. Dice & set aside.
  
  Cook spaghetti according to instructions, rinse, drain & set aside.
  
  Heat oil & saute onion, celery, carrots & red bell pepper in a large
  skillet until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the
  sun-dried tomatoes followed by the zucchini, eggplant, garlic,
  mushrooms, tomatoes & tofu.  Cook over a low heat until the liquid
  has evaporated.
  
  Stir in the rest of the ingredients.  Place spaghetti on a large
  serving platter, top with sauce & serve.
  
  Mark's Notes: Ensure that these vegetables are finely diced so that
  they can cook quickly & you can get a medley of tastes in your mouth.
  I do not cook the spaghetti while the sauce is cooking. While there
  is a risk of overcooking when the vegetables are diced this small, I
  still prefer to cook my sauce, let it sit to allow the flavours to
  develop & then serve over freshly cooked pasta. I hate cold pasta
  with hot sauces. Also, add a handful of finely chopped fresh parsley
  just before serving.

  Long, long ago when events were recorded only on cavern walls by the
  ancients who inhabited these halls, a legend was born. The legendary
  spamonster of Townloch had shown itself only to select tribespeople,
  and only on rare occasions. These urges to appear usually occured
  around oestertide to celebrate the glory that is spring! How very
  lucky we are to bear witness to such a fabulous event! To mark this
  occasion a traditional feast has been prepared for your enjoyment
  :)
  
  PREPARATION: Combine all ingredients in a food processor. Use on and
  off method until a fine paste is formed. Serve dip with your favorite
  chips or fresh veggies. Enjoy!

  spinach, squeezing it in bunches in a towel.  (If using frozen
  spinach, just let it thaw and squeeze out the excess moisture.) Saute
  the onion and mushrooms in a little olive oil and butter with the
  garlic and salt and pepper to taste. When both onions and mushrooms
  are tender remove from heat. Beat the eggs in a large bowl and

      Title: SPANAKOPITA (CHANTILLES)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Olive oil or butter
      1 sm Bunch scallions; chopped
      3 lb Spinach; washed & drained
      1 sm Bunch parsley; chopped
      1 sm Bunch fresh dill; chopped
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 lb Feta cheese, crumbled
      4    Eggs; lightly beaten
     12    Commercial filo sheets
      6 tb Butter; melted
           Bread crumbs, if necessary
 
  Heat the 1/3 cup oil in a large pan and saute the scallions until
  soft. Meanwhile, pan the spinach (cook it without adding water, then
  drain it thoroughly)  or salt and rinse it (the latter method is used
  extensively in Greece, but it not advisable).  Squeeze out excess
  liquid. Add the spinach to scallions and stir in the parsley, dill,
  and a very little salt and pepper.  Cook gently for 10 minutes, then
  cool. (This much can be done in advance and stored in the
  refrigerator). Using a wooden spoon, stir in the feta and eggs.
  
  Butter a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and in it spread 6 filo sheets,
  brushing each with melted butter.  Pour in the spinach filling, then
  cover with the remaining filo sheets (buttering each as before). Tuck
  the top filo over the bottom and flute the edges.  Score the top 3
  filo sheets into square or diamond shapes.  Bake in a moderate oven
  (350 F) for 40 minutes, or until crisp and a golden chestnut color.
  Remove from oven and let stand for 15 minutes before cutting.  Serve
  warm.
  
  Note: Some of the favorite variations: Use some nutmeg, or substitute
  mint for the dill; use grated cheese instead of feta (be discreet
  with the salt if the cheese is salty); add a small handful of raw
  long-grain white rice to the filling.  You will surely invent your
  own flavor combinations which is why spanakopita is so great.

   With pastry brush, lightly brush 7 sheets of filo with olive oil and
  layer in bottom of lightly oiled 2 x 7 x 12-inch glass baking dish.
  Edges of dough may come up sides. If dough tears, use it anyway,
  except top layer, which should not be torn for best appearance.
   Spread tofu spinach filling evenly over top of layered dough. Fold
  edges of dough over top of filling.
   Lightly brush 7 more sheets of phyllo dough down into sides of dish.
  Score top layer of phyllo  with sharp knife to show serving-size
  pieces. This will make it easier to cut later. Bake, uncovered, at
  350 degrees until golden brown on top (20-30 minutes). Serve hot or
  cold.
  
   Triangles: To make Spanakopita into little triangles (good for
  appetizers or finger food for picnics and travel), lay thawed phyllo
  dough flat on dry surface.
   Cut sheets of dough into 3 strips (about 3 1/2 x 12 inches) and
  cover with damp towel to prevent drying out. Take 2 strips of dough;
  brush lightly with olive oil and lay on top of each other. Put 1-2
  tablespoons tofu spinach filling on bottom edge of dough. Fold dough
  over filling in triangle shape so corner touches opposite long side.
  Cut triangle loose. Continue folding like a flag, keeping triangle
  shape. Lightly brush top with olive oil. Repeat until tofu spinach
  filling is used up. Put on lightly oiled cookie sheet; bake at 350

      Title: SPANAKOPITA II
 Categories: Greek
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Spinach, fresh
      1 lb Filo dough
    1/2 lb Feta cheese
      7    Eggs
      1    Onion, diced
 
  Dice the onion and saute it until golden brown.
  
  While the onion is cooking, wash the spinach.  Put it in a bowl and
  rub lots of salt into it. Let the spinach/salt sit for 15 minutes.
  This is meant to reduce the volume of spinach. An alternative to this
  is to barely steam the spinach (30-60 seconds).
  
  Beat the eggs.  Crumble the feta cheese and add to the eggs. Note
  that feta cheese is fairly salty. You can replace half or all of it
  with ricotta cheese.
  
  Rinse all the salt out of the spinach.  Add it and the onions to the
  eggs/cheese and mix.  Also add some spices. The original recipes
  calls for salt, pepper and oregano. I use basil.
  
  Melt some butter (at least 2 oz).  Butter the bottom of a 9x13 inch
  baking dish.  Lay the filo down one layer at a time, brushing butter
  on each layer. Turn each successive layer a little so they are not
  all piled directly on top of each other. The filo will hang over the
  sides of the dish.  Continue until you have 3-5 sheets of filo left.
  
  Pour the filling into the filo.  Fold the filo that hangs over the
  side over the filling. Place the last pieces of filo on top,
  buttering each as you go. Trim off the filo that hangs over the edge
  of the dish. These last pieces serve to cover the filling.
  
  Make two or three slits with a knife in the top layers of filo that
  go all the way down to the filling. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 50
  minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Greek spinach and cheese pie -- This recipe is from the Vegetarian
  Epicure by Anna Thomas. It takes lots of time to make, but is well
  worth it.
  
  *  You can vary the filling to suit your tastes. We've thought of
  adding mushrooms.
  
  *  My husband complains about how thick and hard to cut the bottom of
  the spanakopita is.  His suggestions (none of which I've tried)
  include using more butter and alternating layers of filo and filling.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.

      Title: SPANAKOPITA NISTISIMI (LENTEN SPINACH PIE)
 Categories: Appetizers, Ethnic, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Curly endive
      3 lb Fresh bulk spinach
           -washed, large stems removed
      3 bn Large scallions
           - white and green chopped
           - together
      5 tb Fruity olive oil
      1    Lemon
  1 1/2 c  Finely chopped fresh dill
      1 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Rice or cracked wheat

MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
           Extra flour for rolling
      1 ts Sea salt
      1 ts Baking powder
      5 tb Olive oil (about)
      1 tb Sesame seeds
 
  Start by making the pastry.  Sift the flour with the salt and baking
  powder. Mix in about 6 tablespoons water, a little at a time, until
  the dough is gooey, but not wet. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus
  another teaspoonful, and a little more flour, if needed, to make a
  cohesive mass. Knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes, until smooth and
  elastic. Cover it and set aside to relax for an hour or two.
  
  For the filling, separate the curly endive leaves, so the vegetable
  will cook in the same time.  Steam the spinach and endive together in
  a large pan, in the water clinging to the leaves, plus just an extra
  1/2 cup. Turn the leaves over occasionally, so they wilt evenly. When
  they are wilted, but not mushy, drain them in a colander, pressing
  firmly with the back of a wooden spoon to remove as much excess
  liquid as possible. (Reserve the liquid for use in soup, or drink
  with a squeeze of lemon juice, as the Greeks do.)
  
  Saute the scallions in 2 tablespoons olive oil, until barely soft.
  Add a few tablespoons of water if they stick to the pan. Roughly chop
  the cooked spinach and curly endive and finely grate the zest from
  the lemon. Then toss the cooked vegetables with the scallions,
  parsley, dill, lemon zest and 1 tablespoon lemon juice, salt, and
  pepper, adding 3 tablespoons olive oil. Set aside until you are ready
  to fill the pastry.
  
  Choose an ovenproof earthenware or glass baking dish 2 to 2-1/2
  inches deep and about 2-quart capacity and brush the inside with oil.
  Divide the pastry into two unequal parts, and then again into halves.
  On a floured surface roll out one of the larger pieces of pastry.
  This should be large enough to line the dish, coming up and over the
  sides - this should make it very thin.  Fit it into the baking dish
  and brush it with olive oil. Do the same with the second piece of
  pastry, placing it on top of the first, and brush again with olive
  oil.
  
  Sprinkle the tablespoon of rice or cracked wheat over the bottom, to
  soak up excess juices, and fill with the spinach and herb mixture.
  Roll out the remaining two pieces of pastry, separately, to fit the
  top of the dish. Place the first on top of the spinach, brush with
  olive oil, then place the second on top of that. Prick the pastry
  with a fork in an attractive pattern and brush the entire top with
  olive oil. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Bake in an oven preheated to
  350 F for 45-50 minutes, until golden brown.

      Title: SPANAKOPITA QUICHE
 Categories: Meatless
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Vegetable cooking spray
     10 oz Frozen chopped spinach;
           -thawed and drained
      1 c  1% low-fat cottage cheese
      2 oz Crumbled feta cheese; (1/2
           -cup)
    1/4 ts Pepper
    2/3 c  Nonfat buttermilk
      2    Eggs
      1    Egg white
    1/4 c  Chopped green onions
      1 tb Chopped fresh oregano
      1 lg Clove garlic
      6    Frozen phyllo pastry; thawed
      2 tb Fine dry breadcrumbs;
           -divided
  1 1/2 c  Sliced plum tomato;
           -(1/4-inch-thick)
 
  Coat a 9-inch pieplate with cooking spray; set aside. Press spinach
  between paper towels until barely moist; set aside.
  
  Position knife blade in food processor bowl; add cottage cheese and
  next 5 ingredients, and process until smooth. Add spinach, green
  onions, oregano, and garlic; process 45 seconds. Set aside.
  
  Working with 1 phyllo sheet at a time, lightly coat each sheet with
  cooking spray. Fold phyllo sheet in half crosswise to form a 13- x
  8-1/2-inch rectangle, and lightly coat both sides of rectangle with
  cooking spray. Gently press rectangle into pieplate, allowing ends to
  extend over edges of pieplate.
  
  Repeat procedure with a second sheet of phyllo, placing it across
  first sheet in a crisscross design; sprinkle 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs
  over second sheet. Repeat procedure with remaining phyllo and
  breadcrumbs, continuing in crisscross design, ending with phyllo.
  Fold in edges of phyllo to fit pieplate and form a rim.
  
  Pour spinach mixture into prepared crust; gently arrange tomato
  slices over filling.
  
  Bake at 350 deg for 55 minutes or until a knife inserted 1 inch from
  center comes out clean; let stand 10 minutes. Yield: 6 servings
  (serving size: 1 wedge).
  
  Serving Ideas : Cut into wedges.
  
  NOTES : Spinach, feta cheese, and phyllo dough, key ingredients in the
  classic Greek dish spanakopita (span-uh-KOH-pih-tuh), combine with
  cottage cheese in this unique quiche. Breadcrumbs sprinkled between
  the phyllo layers prevent a soggy crust.

      5 ea Egg
    3/4 lb Phyllo pastry
           Melted butter as needed
    1/2 lb Feta cheese, crumbled
 
     Wash spinach in plenty of water and cut in sm. pcs.; place in
  bowl. Salt lightly; stir to spread salt evenly. Take spinach, a
  handful at a time, and squeeze out the excess water; place it in
  another bowl. Saute the onion in half the butter until it is a light,
  golden color; add the scallions and cook untill they wilt. Add
  spinach; stir until all vegs. take on a light color.  Stir in the
  dill, parsley, salt and pepper; cover the pot and cook until all the
  water thrown off by the spinach is absorbed. Remove from the heat;
  turn into a bowl, and immediately add the milk (to cool the spinach).
  Beat the eggs in another bowl and add the cheese to them; add to the
  cooled spinach; mix well.
  
     Line a pan with 8 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each sheet with
  the melted butter before topping it with the next sheet. Do not trim
  the overhanging sections. Pour in the spinach mixture, spreading it
  evenly over the phyllo.  Fold the part of the phyllo that extends out
  of the pan back over the filling. Lay the remaining phyllo on top,
  again brushing each sheet with melted butter before adding the next.
  Now trim the overlap. Brush additional melted butter on top of the
  pie and score it into square or diamond-shaped serving pcs. Bake for
  30 to 45 min. in a preheated 300 F. oven; let it stand for 30 min.
  before serving.
  
     NOTE:  This can also be made without precooking the spinach. In
  that case, squeeze the spinach free of as much water as possible, mix
  it with the seasonings, and proceed as above, baking it for 1 hr.

  minutes). Uncover and stir in the spinach, parsley, mint; season with
  salt and pepper. Partially cover the pan and continue cooking,
  stirring with a wooden spoon until the spinach has wilted. Grate a
  little nutmeg over the top and continue cooking until all the liquid
  has been absorbed and the spanakorizo is tender, not mushy. Remove
  from the heat and drape with a dry towel until ready to use. Transfer
  to a warm serving dish, and garnish with the sliced eggs and lemon
  wedges.  Serve warm. Note: To make Prassorizo (Leek Rice), substitute
  1 1/2 pounds sliced leeks for the spinach and add with the liquid.

      Title: SPANISH CREAM
 Categories: Desserts, New zealand
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Milk
           -(one Imperial pint)
      4 ts Gelatine
      2    Eggs
    1/2 ts Vanilla essence
    1/3 c  Sugar
 
  Save a small amount of the milk; put the rest in a saucepan, together
  with the sugar and vanilla and heat.
  
  Separate the egg whites and save for later.  Beat the egg yolks with
  the remainder of the milk and add to the heating mixture.
  
  Stir to ensure the sugar is dissolved and bring to near boiling point
  to thoroughly cook the eggs.  Do not actually boil. Take the saucepan
  off the heat. Dissolve the gelatine in about 1/4 cup of boiling water
  and stir into hot custard. Pour into serving dish and put into
  refrigerator to cool.
  
  When mixture has cooled and almost set (it should be shivery at this
  point) thoroughly beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them in
  using a metal spoon. Return mixture to refrigerator to properly set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Exquisite New Zealand custard dessert -- This dessert was a family
  favourite, and although we used to eat it in conjunction with some
  flavored jellies, it's delicious in its own right. The recipe comes
  from my mother, and I don't know what the Spanish part signifies.
  
  *  The texture of this dessert is supposed to be semi-fluffy. If you
  fold in the egg whites too soon, the liquid custard won't support
  them and you end up with a two-layer result, solid custard on top,
  very light on the bottom. Some people may like this, but it's not the
  way I make it. On the other hand, if you leave things too long, it
  becomes difficult to fold in the egg whites at all.
  
  *  It's a good idea to whip the custard a little with a fork prior to
  folding in the whites. This breaks up the custard a little.
  
  *  Depending on sweetness of taste, you may wish to alter the amount
  of sugar. Our family had a sweet tooth, and I've reduced the original
  quantity as it is.
  
  *  One of the amazing things about this dessert is that it's so easy
  to make, and yet tastes so good.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes + setting.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SPANISH POTATO OMELET (TORTILLA A LA ESPAOLA
 Categories: Spanish, Potatoes, Eggs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Olive oil, or a mixture of o
      1 x  Vegetable oil
      4 ea Large potatoes, peeled and c
      1 x  Slices
      1 ea Large onion, thinly sliced
      1 x  Coarse salt
      4 ea Large eggs
 
  Heat the oil in an 8 or 9- inch skillet and add the portato slices
  one at a time so they don't stick togeather. Alternate layers of
  potato and onion slices and salt the layers lightly. Cook slowly over
  medium heat (the potatoes will really "boil" in the oil rather than
  fry), lifting and turning the potatoes occasionally, until they are
  tender but not brown. The potatoes should remain separated, not in a
  "cake". Drain the potatoes in a colander, reserving about 3
  tablespoons of the oil.(the onion and potato give the oil a wonderful
  flavor, so save the rest for some other use.) Wipe out the skillet,
  scraping off any stuck particles. (If this is difficult to do, wash
  the skillet. It will be used again to set the omelet and must be
  completely clean to avoid sticking.) Meanwhile, in a large bowl beat
  the eggs with a fork until they are slightly foamy. Salt to taste.
  Add the potatoes to the egg, pressing down with a pancake turner so
  that they are completely covered by the egg. Let the mixture sit for
  15 minutes. Heat two tablespoons of the reserved oil in the skillet
  until it reaches the smoking point. (It must be very hot or the eggs
  will stick.) Add the potato and egg mixture, spreading it out rapidly
  in the skillet with the aid of a pancake turner. Lower the heat to
  medium high and shake the pan often to prevent sticking. When the
  eggs begin to brown underneath, invert a plate of the same size over
  the skillet and flip the omelet onto the plate. Add about 1
  talbespoon more oil to the pan, then slide the omelet back into the
  skillet to brown on the other side. Lower the heat to medium and flip
  the omelet two ot three more times (this helps to give the omelet a
  good shape while it continues to cook), cooking briefly on each side.
  It should be juicy within. Transfer to a platter and cool, then cut
  in thin wedges or into 1 - 1 1/2- inch squares that can be picked up
  with toothpicks [May be prepared ahead]. Fat grams per serving:

  Also, just wanted to note, I started this program just before
  travelling home from Christmas at my parents' house. I stopped at a
  restaurant with a salad bar, got veggie soup, salade and a plain
  baked potato on the side. They had fruit on the salad bar too, so I
  could have had that for dessert, but I didn't have any room left in
  the tum.

      Title: SPANISH TORTILLA
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Potatoes peeled & sliced
      4    Medium eggs
      4 tb Olive oil
           Salt to taste
 
   In Spain, a tortilla is a peasant potato omlette. It is usually
  eaten at room temperature, and is standard picnic food. It's cooked
  in a medium sized sautee (or frying) pan and is round and solid;
  serve it sliced in pie-shaped pieces.
   Heat oil in pan, lower heat and sautee potatoes slowly until fairly
  soft. Turn and "slice" at them often with spoon or metal spatula.
  Scrape pan so nothing sticks. Lift cooked potatoes into bowl, add
  slightly beaten eggs and salt, mix lightly and return to pan (add a
  little oil if none remains). Cook slowly until bubbles start to
  appear on top, or it seems half-cooked. Loosen from pan with spatula
  if necessary. Place a plate on top, turn tortilla over on to pan,
  then slide it off into pan to cook on other side. Should be solid
  when fin- ished. Remove from pan the same way. (Experts flip the
  tortilla to turn it - I have never had the nerve to even TRY this!).
  Makes a good side dish, light supper, or picnic dish. FROM: HEATHER

  slotted spoon and transfer to a cold water bath.  This will loosen
  their tough outer skins.  Using a small paring knife, carefully peel
  skins from beans.
  
  Return water to a boil.  Dunk tomatoes in boiling water until skin
  loosens, about 30 seconds.  Transfer tomatoes to a cold water bath.
  Peel tomatoes, remove seeds and chop into small pieces.
  
  Heat olive oil in a large skillet or paella pan over medium-low heat.
  Add onions and slowly saute until golden, about 10 minutes.  Stir in

      Title: SPANOKOPITA (GREEK SPINACH PIE)
 Categories: Greece
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 pk Frozen spinach (10 oz)
           Salt, preferably sea salt
      1    Onion, chopped
      1 lb Fresh mushrooms, sliced
           Olive oil
           Butter
      1    Clove garlic, minced
           Ground pepper to taste
      6    Eggs
      1 c  Feta cheese
      1 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1 ts Oregano
    1/4 ts Dried rosemary (optional)
    1/4 lb Butter
      1 lb Filo dough
 
  If you are using fresh spinach, wash the spinach and remove the tough
  stems.  Place in a large bowl and sprinkle heavily with salt. Rub the
  salt into the leaves by taking them up, a bunch at a time, and
  rubbing them between your hands; the volume of the spinach will
  decrease before your eyes.  Tear the spinach up as you do this. Rinse
  the salt off thoroughly and dry the spinach, squeezing it in bunches
  in a towel. (If you are using frozen spinach, just let it thaw and
  squeeze out excess moisture).
  
  Saute the onion and mushrooms in a little olive oil and butter with
  the garlic and salt and pepper to taste. When both the onions and
  mushrooms are tender, remove from the heat.
  
  Beat the eggs in a large bowl and crumble in the feta cheese; add the
  Parmesan, then the spinach, onions, and mushrooms. Stir in the
  parsley, oregano, rosemary, some freshly ground pepper, and a little
  salt (remember that the feta is very salty).
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Melt the butter and brush a 2-quart or 3-quart oblong baking pan with
  it. Spread your filo dough out flat next to the pan. Take a sheet and
  lay it in the pan, letting the edges come out over the pan. Take
  another sheet and lay it on top of the first, not directly but in
  such a way that its edges extend over different parts of the pan.
  Brush with butter. Continue to layer the sheets of filo, brushing
  every other one with butter and turning each one slightly so that the
  edges fan out over the sides of the pan, until you have about eight
  sheets left.
  
  Now spread the spinach mixture evenly over the filo dough in the pan,
  pushing it into the corners.  Take the edges of the filo and fold
  them in over the spinach mixture.
  
  Take the remaining sheets of filo and layer them one by one over the
  spinach mixture, again brushing every other sheet with butter, but
  this time pushing the edges down into the sides of the pan. It is
  difficult to do this neatly; just rumple the edges down into the
  sides of the pan (they will form a nice crisp edge after baking).
  Brush the top of the spanokopita with butter and make +-inch-deep
  diagonal slashes across it with a sharp knife.
  
  Bake for 50 minutes, until the crust is puffed up and golden; it will
  shrink from the sides of the pan.  Cut into squares or diamond shapes
  and serve immediately.

      Title: SPANOKOPITA GREEK SPINACH & CHEESE PIE
 Categories: Appetizers, Greek, Mc
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
        2 lb fresh spinach
        1 lb filo dough
      1/2 lb feta cheese
        7    eggs
        1    onion -- diced
  
  Dice the onion and saute it until golden brown.  While the onion is
  cooking, wash the spinach. Put it in a bowl and rub lots of salt into
  it. Let the spinach/salt sit for 15 minutes. This is meant to reduce
  the volume of spinach. An alternative to this is to barely steam the
  spinach (30-60 seconds).  Beat the eggs. Crumble the feta cheese and
  add to the eggs. (Note that feta cheese is fairly salty.You can
  replace half or all of it with ricotta cheese.)  Rinse all the salt
  out of the spinach. Add it and the onions to the eggs/cheese and mix.
  Also add some spices. The original recipes calls for salt, pepper,
  and oregano.I use basil. Melt some butter (at least 2 oz .)  Butter
  the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Lay the filo down one layer at
  a time, brushing butter on each layer. Turn each successive layer a
  little so they are not all piled directly on top of each other. The
  filo will hang over the sides of the dish. Continue until you have
  3-5 sheets of filo left.  Pour the filling into the filo. Fold the
  filo that hangs over the side over the filling. Place the last pieces
  of filo on top, buttering each as you go. Trim off the filo that
  hangs over the edge of the dish. These last pieces serve to cover the
  filling. Make two or three slits with a knife in the top layers of
  filo that go all the way down to the filling. Bake at 375 for 50
  minutes. I searched high and low for the perfect spanakopita. This
  was darn near perfection. This recipe is from the Vegetarian Epicure

      Title: SPARE RIBS
 Categories: Improv, Kohl, Meats
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      5 lb Spareribs
      1    Bottle catsup ==OR== 1
           - 15 oz can tomato sauce
      2 tb Brown sugar ==OR== syrup
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Flour
      1 tb Hot dry mustard
      1 tb Chili powder
      1 ts Ground cloves
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
      1 md Can crushed pineapple
 
  Cut ribs into sections of two bones each. Grease a pan with oil. Mix
  together catsup, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix together
  flour, mustard, chili powder, cloves, salt and pepper. Combine dry
  and liquid mixtures with crushed pineapple. Lay meat in layers in a
  pan, with some sauce in between, then top all with remaining sauce.
  
  Bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour or until done.  Brown under broiler,
  turning pieces over to brown both sides. Watch carefully and do not
  allow sauce to burn. In fact, it's best to remove the sauce until
  ribs are browned, and then spread it over the ribs after browning.

      2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Salt
      1 tb Farina (good luck finding

  From: Country Tastes: Best Recipes From America's Kitchens
  
  This cross between noodles and dumplings was brought to the United
  States by immigrants from Austria and Hungary.
  
  In a medium-sized bowl, combine flour, 1 teaspoon salt and farina.
  Blend in eggs and enough water to make a thick stiff dough. Bring a
  pot of water to a boil and add remaining salt to it. Turn dough onto
  a board. Cut into almond-sized pieces.  Drop into boiling water to
  make dumplings. Or, press through a spatzle maker into boiling water.
  After dumplings rise, cook 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from water
  with a slotted spoon. Turn into a warm serving dish. Toss with melted
  butter. Makes 4 servings.

      Title: SPATZLI (EGG NOODLES)
 Categories: Swiss, Dumplings, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Flour; Unbleached
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Nutmeg (optional)
      4    Eggs; Large, Beaten
    1/2 c  (or more) Water
    1/4 c  Butter
 
  Sift flour, salt and nutmeg together in a bowl.  Pour eggs and 1/4 cup
  water into middle of flour mixture, beat with a wooden spoon. Add
  enough water to make the dough slightly sticky, yet keeping it
  elastic and stiff. Using a spaetzle machine or a colander with medium
  holes, press the noodles into a large pot full of boiling salted
  water. Cook noodles in the water about 5 minutes or until they rise
  to the surface. Lift noodles out and drain on paper towels.  Brown
  noodles in melted butter over low heat, and serve with a main dish.
  Or, don't bother browning them, and serve in/with soup, or with stew.
  
  (Another method for shaping the noodles is to spread the mixture on a
  wooden board and cut off little pieces, dropping them in the boiling
  water and fishing them out quickly when they're done.)
  
  (Be prepared to write off your first few attempts at spaetzle, by the
  way.
   They are very labor-intensive, and a little miscalculation with the
  time in the hot water can ruin them. One joke I heard about them
  while in Switzerland:  Man in restaurant to chef --  "These spaetzli
  are terrible!" Chef:  "How dare you!  I've been making them since
  before you were born!" Man: "Yes, but did you have to leave them in
  the water that long?!")

  1 1/2 lb Chicken wings, cut-up into
           -segments at joints.

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------

MMMMM-------------------------A MIXTURE------------------------------
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Sugar
      1 tb Sherry wine
           A few gratings of fresh
           -ginger
      2 ts Hoisin sauce
      1    Clove garlic, minced
    1/4 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Salt
        ds MSG (optional)

MMMMM-------------------------B MIXTURE------------------------------
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Flour
           Oil for deep frying
           Lettuce leaves, shredded
 
  Green onion, Chinese parsley and cashew nuts, all chopped, for
  garnish This is one of the better deep-fried chicken recipes I've
  found. It calls for chicken wings, but I used a whole chicken, cut up
  Chinese style and just increased the marinade ingredients a tad.
  
  Serve this with side dishes of hoisin sauce, spiced salt (toasted salt
  mixed with black pepper about half and half), hot mustard and chili
  oil along with a bowl of finely chopped scallions. Dip piece of
  chicken into the dip of your choice, then into the scallions and
  enjoy! Ice cold beer goes great with this dish. Oh yeah++steamed rice
  too...
  
  Be sure to use the dark, toasted sesame oil rather than the health
  food store stuff.
  
  1.  Soak cut-up chicken in marinade ingredients A for 1 hour. Mix
  ingredients B into bowl with marinated chicken. Stir well. Will be
  very sticky and stiff to mix.
  
  2.  Heat 2 inches oil in wok to 375F.  Drop batter covered chicken
  piece by piece carefully into hot oil. Do not fill wok too full of
  chicken or it will take too long to brown. Should take only 5 minutes
  to cook through. Result will be crispy golden brown chicken pieces.
  
  3.  Drain on paper towels.  Place on platter lined with lettuce
  shreds.
  
  4.  Garnish if desired with chopped green onions, Chinese parsley and
  cashew nuts.

  remaining flour with ghee and 1 tablespoon oil. Roll out each ball
  thinly and smear the mixture of oil and ghee over two-thirds of each
  round. Fold the ungreased portion of each round over the greased and

  cloth for half an hour or more. Roll it out lightly (without
  pressing) into thick squares (good luck!) Heat the griddle. Heat the
  parotta, adding a teaspoon of oil around the sides and turning
  frequently till both sides are golden and crisp. Press it side to
  side so that the layers get loose. Serve hot. -----! Note: Serve with

      Title: SPECIAL POTATO FRITTATA
 Categories: Potatoes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4    Stick butter
      2 tb Olive oil
      3    Potatoes, diced
    1/4 c  Grated parmesan
    3/4 ts Paprika
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/8 ts Italian seasoning
      4    Eggs, beaten to blend
      2 tb All purpose flour
           Salt and ground pepper
 
  A while back Earl was kind enough to send me a cookbook he authored.
  
  It's a small paperback on camp cooking that has both tips on things
  like how to avoid eating freeze dried noodles and grayling for six
  days straight and recipes tailored for the camp cook. Since I go
  camping about once every other decade, I don't think I'll wait to try
  the following...
  
  Here is a breakfast better than many get at home. With the cheese and
  seasonings, it makes getting up in the morning a pleasure.
  
  Melt butter with oil in a skillet over medium heat. Mix potatoes and
  flour. Add potato, paprika, garlic powder and Italian seasoning to
  skillet and cook until potatoes are just tender, stirring often for
  10 minutes. Combine eggs with parmesan cheese in medium bowl. Season
  with salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture over potatoes. Pierce holes in
  egg mixture and lift edges with spatula, tipping pan to allow
  uncooked egg to flow under, until edge forms, about one minute; do
  not stir. Reduce heat to low, cover skillet and continue until eggs
  are set.

      Title: SPECIAL STEAKS (VENISON OR BEEF)
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6    Boneless venison chops --
           All fat cut off
      1 c  White wine
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup,
           Condensed
      1 sm Onion -- sliced thinly
           Spoon of vegetable oil
 
  Brown the venison chops in the oil on the stove.  This is just to
  give them color, not to cook them so don't cook too long. Put the
  venison in a casserole along with the onion slices. Pour the white
  wine on top. It should just barely cover the meat, so add more if you
  need. Bake for one hour at 175C (350F). After one hour, mix in the
  can of cream of mushroom soup.  Do not add any water. The soup will
  probably not mix well, don't worry about it as it will "melt" while
  cooking. Bake another hour at 175C (350F).  Very good with wild rice.

      Title: SPECKKNOEDEL (AUSTRIAN BACON DUMPLINGS)
 Categories: Pork, German
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      6 sl Slightly stale white bread
      5 sl Thick cut bacon
    1/3 c  Light cream
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts (heaping) caraway seeds
    1/4 ts Dried thyme
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
           Yolk of one large egg
      1 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Sliced white onions
    1/2 lb Rinsed and drained
           -sauerkraut
      1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
 
  1.  Trim the bread slices and cut them into 1/2 inch cubes.
  
  2.  Cut the bacon slices into 1/3 inch squares.  Saute them over
  moderate heat in a large skillet for about 5 minutes. Stir
  frequently. Transfer them to paper towels with a slotted spoon, and
  pat dry.
  
  3.  Pour water to a depth of 3 inches into a wide bottomed pot and
  bring it to a simmer (in preparation for step 8).
  
  4.  Brown the bread cubes in the hot bacon fat for 3 to 5 minutes.
  Transfer them to a large bowl.
  
  5.  Add the cream to the bowl.  Gently toss the bread until it
  absorbs all the cream. Add to this mixture the bacon, flour, baking
  powder, caraway seeds, thyme, pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt.
  Beat the egg yolk and add it to the bowl.  Gently blend all the
  ingredients.
  
  6.  Shape the mixture into 1 1/4 inch spheres with your hands. (If
  your mixture is too dry, moisten it with a little more cream.) Place
  the dumplings on a plate as you make them, arranging them in one
  layer so they do not touch each other.
  
  7.  Melt the butter to moderate heat in a clean large skillet. Add the
  onions and saute for 2 minutes. Add the sauerkraut and the remaining
  salt and blend the mixture. Cover, and cook for 12 minutes.
  
  8.  Cook the dumplings in the simmering water for about 10 minutes
  (start this step as soon as you cover the onion-sauerkraut pan.) You
  need not turn the dumplings as they will do that by themselves.
  
  9.  Transfer the cooked 'speckknoedel' to a warm bowl and cover them
  with the onion-sauerkraut mixture. Garnish with parsley and serve
  immediately.
  
  Serves 3 to 4.
  
  (Note: The ingredient listing does not show any butter, but the
  instructions do.  One Tbsp would do adequately, I would think. (And
  back home, we would dust the onions with flour near the end of the
  roasting period, and add a little stock, to have the sauerkraut in a
  thin sort of gravy.  Karin.)

  butter and knead and beat the dough until it starts to form small
  bubbles. Shape into rounds that are about half a finger's width
  thickness and about 5 inches in diameter.  Tweak the edges of the
  dough into a raised rim. Cover the dough circles with
  
  A) egg yolk and then lightly press in the bacon and add the remainder
  of the ingredients, OR
  
  B) lard and then lightly press in the cracklings. Season with salt.

      Title: SPECULATIUS COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/4 c  Unsifted flour
    3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/4 ts Ground clovees
    1/4 ts Ground mace
      1 pn Salt
    3/4 c  (1-1/2 sticks) sweet butter
      1 c  Confectioners' sugar
      1    Egg
      1 ts Grated lemon rind
 
  Spicy holiday cookies made with a rolling pin or wooden molds.
  
  NOTE: When unsifted flour is called for, fluff up the flour in the
  sack or container with a fork before measuring.
  
  Preheat oven to 350~
  
  Combine flour, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, mace and salt onto
  wax paper.
  
  Beat butter with sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy; beat
  in egg and lemon rind. Stir in flour mixture, blending well.
  
  Roll out dough, one half at a time, on a lightly floured surface to a
  1/4-inch thickness. Use a floured speculatius or springerle rolling
  pin (see note #2 below) and roll over dough only once, pressing
  designs into dough to an 1/8 inch thickness. Cut cookies apart on
  dividing lines. Place cookies, 1 inch apart, on ungreased cookie
  sheets. Repeat with remaining dough.
  
  Bake in a 350~ oven for 15 minutes or until cookies are a light golden
  brown.
  
  Remove from cookie sheets to wire racks; cool completely.
  
  NOTE 2:  Instead of speculatius rolling pin, you can use speculatius
  wooden molds which make larger cookies so the yield will be less.

  this great recipe easier to enjoy these days...but I still like it
  after (if and when) I come back from the health club, which I promise
  to do much more often, starting next Monday! Whilrl all ingredients
  in a blender of food processor ~ I like to keep them a little
  "chunky", but adjust to your personal preference.  You may need to
  process two batches to avoid overflow.   Pour mixture into large
  pitcher; refrigerate, or add 6-7 ice cubes to hasten chilling. Serve
  with a dollop of curried mayonnaise or sour cream, if your calorie
  counter can handle it!

 Categories: Breadmaker
      Yield: 14 Servings
 
      1 tb Wonderslim
      9 oz Water
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Spelt flour
      2 c  Bread flour ; white
      3 tb Sugar
      1 ts Active dry yeast ; red star,
           ; fleischmann's may
           ; need more
 
  Recipe by: Deborah Rech Original recipe called for 2 T butter or
  margarine instead of Wonderslim.
  
  I use the standard bread cycle, light crust setting.
  
  This loaf is milder than whole wheat, but has more character than
  white bread.  If you choose to use whole wheat flour (which I think
  would overwhelm the flavor of the spelt), you would need to add a
  little gluten to help the rise -- maybe one rounded tablespoon.

  cohesive ball. Reserve the remaining tea to glaze the tops of the
  crackers.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. With a sharp
  knife, cut the dough into 2-inch shapes.
  
  Place the crackers on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
  sheet. Prick each one all the way through in 2 or 3 places with the
  tines of a fork. Bake for 10 minutes, turn and brush the tops with
  the remaining tea-honey liquid. Continue baking for another 10 to 15
  minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 60-65.
  
  VARIATION: Using a smoky tea such as Darjeeling also produces an
  interesting cracker.

  marinade and stir to coat.
    Refrigerate it for  2  to  8 hours.  Preheat oven to 350. Arrange
