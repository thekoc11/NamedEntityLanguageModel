  chili pods. Let simmer for about 1/2 hour. Posole may be served as a main
  dish with hard rolls, tortillas or crackers. Additional red chili sauce may
  be added at serving time for more spice. NOTE:Posole can be found in the
  meat section if it is available in your area, if not available, hominy can
  be substituted in the same quantities but no rinsing or pre-cooking is
  needed. The posole will lose its authenticity but none of its tastiness if
  pork rinds, pork shanks or pigs feet are omitted. You can also add one can
  of tomatoes to enhance the flavor.

  5 1/2 ts Ground pepper, cayenne         
 
  NOTE:  Fresh Jalapenos are preferred; if you have to use pickled ones,
  rinse as much vinegar from them as possible. Melt the Butter in a 4-quart
  Saucepan over high heat.  Add the Onions,
   bell Peppers and Celery; saute about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add
  the Tomatoes, Tomato Sauce, Jalapenos, bay leaves, ground Peppers and
  Garlic; stir well.  Continue cooking about 3 minutes, stirring often and
  scraping the pan bottom well.  Stir in the stock, Sugar and Salt and bring
  to a bOil.  Reduce heat and simmer until flavors are married, about 20
  minutes, stirring often and scrap- ing pan bottom as needed. (If mixture
  scorches, quit stirring and pour mixture into a clean pot, leaving the
  scorched ingredients in the first pan.) Add the shrimp to the hot (or
  reheated) Sauce and stir.  Turn heat up to high, cover pan, and bring
  mixture to a bOil.  Remove from heat. Let sit covered for 10 minutes.
  (Meanwhile, heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.) Stir, remove bay
  leaves, and serve immediately. To serve, mound 1/2 cup rice in the center
  of ea ch heated serving plate; then pour about 1/2 cup Sauce around the
  rice and arrange about 8 shrimp on top of the Sauce. LAGNIAPPE: "Piquant"
  to a Cajun means "it's hot and 'hurts like a sticker in your tongue.'" If
  you want less "piquant," reduce the Jalapeno Peppers by half. Sauce Piquant
  is enjoyed with such gusto in Louisiana that the town of Raceland has a
  Sauce Piquant Festival every year dedicated to nothing but fish, meat, fowl
  and seafood made with variations of this Sauce. From Paul Prudhomme's

      Title: French's Simply Venison
 Categories: Meats, French
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Deer ham parts                           Coarsley grnd black pepper
           Adolph's Meat Tenderizer                 Squeezable soft margarine
 
  The secret to good venison is always to muscle the meat. Muscling means to
  remove each muscle individually. Once finished, the cook will have several
  cylindrical pieces resembling tenderloin. Place pieces in a Pyrex dish,
  sprinkle each side with meat tenderizer and coarsley ground black pepper.
  Puncture each side liberally with a sharp fork. Squeeze margarine on one
  side. Turn meat over and repeat process on other side. Broil on high heat
  for about 4 minutes. Turn meat over and broil until brown. Remember venison
  is not as good when it is overcooked.

      Title: Veau Dans Le Chaudron ( Veal Pot Roast)
 Categories: Canadian, Veal
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 tb Bacon fat or salad oil            1/4 ts Pepper
      2    Garlic cloves, cut in half        1/4 ts Thyme OR:
      1    Veal - 1/2 leg or:                1/2 ts Savory
           -3 or 4 lb rolled shoulder          1    Bay leaf
           -of veal                            6    Potatoes - medium (6-8)
      1 ts Salt                                6    Onions - medium (6-8)
 
  Melt or heat bacon fat or oil in cast iron saucepan. Stuff the 2 cloves of
  garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place the meat in the
  hot fat and brown well on all sides. Don't rush this as the colour and
  flavour of the finished gravy will depend on how well the meat has been
  browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay leaf. Place the potatoes and
  onions, whole around the meat. Don't add any liquid. Cover tightly and cook
  over medium heat till meat is tender, about 2 hours. The potatoes and
  oniions will not break as there is no liquid added. The veal will make its
  own gravy. When cooked, remove the meat from the pan to a heated platter.
  Place the pan over high heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the
  vegetables. When they are well coated with gravy, boil another minutes or
  so till the gravy has a nice consistency. This is a complete meal.

  Sauce Verte: Chop the vegetables coarsely and put in blender with lemon
  juice. Cover and blend until it turns iinto a sort of mush with small bits
  of this and that in it. Add the mayonnaise and blend. If you don't have a
  blender, chop the ingredients very finely and blend them into the
  mayonnaise with the lemon juice, crushing them as much as possible to give
  color to the sauce.
  
  From the author, "Use salmon steaks for this colourful and tasty dish. It
  is then easy to make it for 2 or 10."

  alive.  My grandmother's recipe is, as far as I am concerned, the best

  maternal grandmother from the American midwest had a similar Christmas
  oyster dish although hers included corn.

  Scots in the 1880s. A girdle is a large cast iron pan.
  
  Heat flat cast iron pan on low heat for 10 to 15 minutes or until hot. (To
  test, sprinkle with a little flour; if it browns in 10 to 15 seconds, the
  pan is hot enough.) Meanwhile in a large mixing bowl, stir flour, baking
  powder, salt and sugar; with fingertips, rub in shortening or lard till
  crumbly. Whisk egg with 1 cup of the milk. Make a well in the centre of the
  dry ingredients; pour in the liquid. With wooden spoon, stir to make soft,
  but not sticky dough, adding more milk as needed. Turn out onto floured
  board, knead 3 or 4 times. Pat or roll to no more than 1/4 - 1/2 inch. With
  sharp knife, cut into small triangles. Place a few at a time on pan; cook,
  rotating scones occasionally for 5 to 6 minutes or until bottoms are
  browned. Serve hot. MAKES: approx 2 DOZEN

  La fricasee fatuguee
  
  Heat in frying pan 2-3 Tbsp melted butter or turkey or chicken fat. Add
  thinly sliced onion and diced celery. Heat 5-8 minutes over low heat,
  stirriing often. Add 2-3 cups cooked turkey. Cook 5 minutes over low heat.
  
  Sauce: Brown the chicken fat (I would use butter) and flour well before
  adding water. Add savory, salt and pepper to taste. When sauce is smooth
  and creamy, add 1/4 cup cream and any remaining turkey or chicken gravy.
  Pour over turkey. Simmer 15 minutes, then serve with hot biscuits and
  pickled beets.
  
  Hot Biscuits: Sift together in bowl, flour, baking powder (no error in
  amount) and salt. Mix together cream with 2 beaten eggs. Add to flour and
  mix just enough to moisten; the dough is rather soft and should remain
  lumpy. Stir as little as possible. Drop by spoonfuls on a greased cookie
  sheet. Cook 16 minutes at 400F.
  
  from Mme. Benoit, "In days that followed Christmas, every bit of the turkey
  was used - the bones for soup, the skin, diced and crisped in the oven til
  browned, then served, instead of butter, on toasted homemade bread. So,
  when it came time to make hash from all the little bits and pieces, the
  children felt that the poor turkey must be tired (fatiguee), hence the
  name.

    1/2 c  Celery;chopped                           -Salt and Pepper
 
  "Newfoundland Pea Soup is very similar, but usually includes more
  vegetables such as diced turnips and carrots, and is often topped with
  small dumplings. This soup is very good reheated.. The most authentic
  version of Quebec's soupe aux pois use whole yellow peas, with salt pork
  and herbs for flavour. After cooking, the pork is usually chopped and
  returned to the soup, or sometimes removed to slice thinly and served
  sepaprately. Instead of fresh or dried herbs, herbes salees (herbs
  preserved with salt) are often used; they are available commercially or
  made at home.
    Pea soup remains a popular dish in resturants where tourists enjoy a true
  taste of old Quebec. In some variations, a little garlic, leeks, other
  vegetables or a ham bone are added for flavour. For a thicker consaistency
  (though this is not traditional) a cup or two of cooked peas can be pureed
  then returned to the soup."
  
  Wash and sort peas; soak in cold water ovvernight. Drain and place in a
  large pot; add water, parsley, salt pork, onion, celery, carrots, parsley,
  bay leaf, savory and 1 tsp salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer
  until peas are very tender, about 2 hours, adding more water if needed.
  Remove salt pork; chop and return to soup. Discard bay leaf. Season to
  taste with salt and pepper. MAKES 8 SERVING: SOURCE: "The First Decade"

      1 c  Whole wheat flour                 1/2 ts -Salt
    1/2 c  All purpose flour                   2 tb Butter, melted

      2 tb Sugar, granulated                 3/4 c  -Water; approx,
      2 ts Baking powder                  
 
  "Bannock, a simple type of scone was cooked in poineer days over open
  fires. Variations in flours and the addtional of dried or fresh fruit make
  this bread the simple choice of Canadian campers even today.  Oven baking
  has become an acceptable alternative to the cast iron frypan. McKelvie's
  resturant in Halifax serves an oatmeal version similatr to this one. For
  plain bannock, omit rolled oats and increase the all purose floue to 1
  cup.... One of the earliest quick breads, bannock was as simple as flour,
  salt, a bit of fat (often bacon grease) and water. In gold rush days, dough
  was mixed right in the prospector's flour bag and cooked in a frypan over
  an open fire.
   Indians wrapped a similar dough around sticks driven into the ground
  beside their camp fire, baking it along with freshly caught fish. Today's
  native _Fried Bread_ is like bannock and cooked in a skillet.
     Newfoundlander's _Damper Dogs_ are small rounds of dough cooked on the
  stove's dampers while _Toutons_ are similar bits of dough deep fried. At a
  promotional luncheon for the 1992 Inuit Circumpolar Conference, Eskimo
  Doughnuts, deep fried rings of bannock dough, were served. It is said that
  Inuit children prefer these "doughnuts" to sweet cookies.
     Red River settlers from Scotland made a frugal bannock with lots of
  flour, little sugar and drippings or lard. Now this same bread plays a
  prominent part in Winnipeg's own Folklorama Festival.
     At Expo '86 in Vanocuver, buffalo on bannock buns was a popular item at
  the North West Territories ' restaurant. In many regions of Canada, whole
  wheat flour or wheat germ replaces part of the flour and cranberries or
  blueberries are sometimes added. A Saskatchewan firm markets a bannock mix,
  and recipe books from coast to coast upgrade bannock with butter, oatmeal,
  raisins, cornmeal and dried fruit."
  
  Stir together flours, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add melted
  butter, raisins (if using) and water, adding more water if needed to make
  sticky dough. With floured hands, pat into greased pie plate. Bake in 400F
  oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until browned and tester comes out clean. Cut
  into wedges. SERVES:6 VARIATIONS: In place of raisins add chopped dried
  apricots or fresh berries.(Blueberries are terrific if one is camping in
  northern Ontario in August.)

      2 c  Rolled oats                         1 c  Shortening

      2 c  Oatmeal; scotch type*             1/4 ts -Salt
      1 c  Flour;all purpose                 1/3 c  Shortening; or lard or
      2 ts Sugar, granulated                        -bacon fat
      2 ts Baking powder                     1/4 c  -Cold water
 
  Anne's note: I prefer the savory version as it is closer to the original
  Scottish version ; my grandmother in Nova Scotia uses 'pinhead' oatmeal, a
  fine grind of oatmeal sold in the Maritimes, "Ogilivy's" is the most
  popular brand there. Processing the oats in a food procesor for a few
  seconds should help.
  
  "If desired process the oats in a food processor for 10 seconds to get a
  finer texture...The original recipe for oatcakes likely arrived with
  Scottish settlers in Nova Scotia. Fine oatmeal ground in the pioneer's
  gristmills, a little fat worked with fingertips, and perhaps a touch of
  sugar, made a crispy baked "cake" to eat with cheese or jam. Over the
  years, Cape Bretoners (and eventually all cooks across Canada) used rolled
  oats and more sugar to make a coolie-like oatcake. The Glenghorm Resort in
  Ingonish, Nova Scotia, prints a recipe for these regional favorites on its
  postcards. Trilibys, a British version, richer and filled with a coked date
  mixture, lead to the Date Sandwich Cookies so popular in Canada over the
  years."
  
  Sweet version: Stir together flour, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt;
  rub in shoetening with fingertips. Mix in water with fork, until ball
  forms; divide in half.
    On a floured surface, roll out each half to 1/4 inch (5 mm) thickness.
  Cut into 2 1/2 inch (6 squares), then into triangles. Bake on lightly
  greased baking sheets in 350F oven for 15 minutes or till lightly browned.
  Transfer to racks to cool. MAKES: 60
  
  Savory Variation: (to serve with cheese) Mix 2 cups Scotch-type oatmeal, 1
  cup all-purpose flour, 2 tsp each granulated sugar and baking powder, and
  1/4 tsp salt. Work in 1/3 cup shortening, lard or bacon fat. Add 1/4 cup
  cold water. Proceed as above.

  "Today a nonstick frypan works well, but just as in the 30s, a black cast
  oiron one is great, too. Thicken the gravy with flour if desired. ... With
  the prairie sloughs dried up and little snow in the winter, there were very
  few wild birbs in the worst years of the 30s. Stuffly, thinly pounded
  less-tender cuts of beef made an adequate substitute. Some books called for
  flank steak, other for round steak. Veal birds are similar, Rouladen, a
  German dish, is made with meat spread with mustard and wrapped around dill
  pickle spears. And in many regions of Canada, venison, moose and caribou
  were used in place of beef. In Newfoundland, savory seasons the stuffing
  and salt pork tops the meat rolls.
  
    In a skillet, cook onion, celery and mushrooms in butter until softened.
  Remove from heat; stir in bread crumbs, savory, thyme, salt and pepper to
  taste and just enough water or stock to mositen.

  "Fish and brewis (pronounced "brews") is one of the oldest traditional
  dishes of Newfoundland. ... The fish in Fish and Brewis is salt cod and the
  brewis is made from hardtack or hardbread, which is avilable everywhere in
  Newfoundland and in specialized grocery stores across Canada. The dish is
  always sprinkled with scrunchions, crisp fried bits of salt pork.
  Fisherman's Brewis is sometimes the same as Fish and Brewis, but often the
  fish and bread are chopped while hot and mixed together, or fresh cod is
  used instead of salt cod."
  
  Cut cod into serving-size pieces. Soak cod and hardbread separately in cold
  water for 8 hours or overnight. Drain fish. In saucepan, cover fish with

 Categories: Desserts, Canadian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Pie dough (double batch)                 Butter
    1/4 c  Cheddar cheese-grated             3/4 c  Sugar
     12    Apples; medium- peeled &          1/4 c  Sugar; Brown
           -cored                            1/4 c  Cream
    1/2 c  Mincement                                Lemon rind; 1/2 lemon
    1/4 c  Rum                            
 
  Preheat oven to 400F. Make enough pie enough to roll into 12 6"x6" squares
  (about a double batch.) Sprinkle each square with 1 tsp grated cheddar.
  Peel and core apples and place one on each square. Fill the centre of each
  apple with 2 tsp (or 1 heaping tsp) of mincement, 1 tsp of rum, a dot of
  butter and 1 Tablespoon sugar. Bring diagonally opposite corners of dough
  over the apple to form ears at the top. Cover the 'ears' with aluminium
  foil. Mix the brown sugar, cream and grated lemon rind. Brush the dumplings
  with this mixture and bake 35 to 45 minutes in 400F oven.Remove foil, brush
  ears with cream mixture and return to oven till 'ears' are brown. Serve
  warm to plain cream or sweetened cream, flavoured with rum.
  
  Note from Anne MacLellan: Mme Benoit does not give total amounts for
  cheese, sugar, mincement and rum. I used Meal Master's conversion to
  decimal and back to calculate the total amounts.
  
  To quote Mme. Benoit,"In Quebec these were baked in deep brown earthenware
  pudding dishes and served on a hot wooden board or tray surrounded by
  autumn leaves or boughs cut from the Christmas tree. It was a traditional
  in our family to serve these dumplings after we had finished decorating the
  Christmas tree."

  whether they were adpated from southern pecan pie, old-fashioned sugar
  pies, or maple syrup, bakcwoods or vinegar pies. Squabbles arise whether or
  not the tarts should be runny or not, and just how runny. Opnions differ
  about the use of syrup or sugar only, eggs beaten or not, currants or
  raisins, and how the tart pans should be filled."

  "This date and nut cake always included a broiled topping. Lazy Daisy was a

  footnote that says that, "This is not to be passed on but must be sold for
  charitable purposes for 15 cents.
    In a reply to our query about the name of this recipe, the Queen Mother's
  Lady-in-Waiting writes; "I fear I have to tell you that, although we have
  known about this recipe for many years, it did not originate from either
  Buckingham Palace or Clarence House...However as Her Majesty always made it
  a rule, due to the number of requests receieved, never to give "favorite
  recipes", I fear that I have to tell you that you that should you wish to
  include this recipe in any cookbook, it should only be called a 'date and
  walnut cake' with no reference to the Queen Mother."
  
  Pour water over dates and soda; let stand until lukewarm. In bowl, cream
  butter with sugar; beat in egg and vanilla. Mix together flour, baking
  powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with date mixture.
  Spread in a greased and floured 9 inch square cake pan. Bake in 350F oven
  for 40 minutes or until tester comes out clean.

  sugar, light cream and coconut (half nuts if desired). Bring to a boil,

  Slice). These recipes appeared under the name Nanaimo Bars in the Vancouver
  Sun in the early 50's and in the B.C. Women's Institute Centennial of B.C.
  Cookbook in 1958. The test kitchens of food companies developed various
  versions with their own products. Since the 50s, endless variations include
  Minted, Grand Marnier, Cherry, Pina Colada, Mocha, and Peanut Butter
  Nanaimo Bars...During the 50s, a Dairy Food Service Bureau recipe called
  Dominoes suggested piping a little bit of the middle layer into dots on top
  to give a domino pattern when cut."
  
  Bottom Layer: In double boiler, melt butter, sugar and cocoa; add egg and
  cook until thickened. Add crumbs, nuts and coconut. Press into ungreased 9
  inch square pan.
   Middle Layer: Beat together butter, cream, custard powder and sugar;
  spread over base. Chill.
   Top Layer: Melt chocolate with butter; cool slightly. Pour over second
  layer; chill. Cut into bars.

      Title: Two Brines for Smoking Fish
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 1 servings
 
----------------------------------BRINE #1----------------------------------
      4 c  Water                                    Plus your choice of
    1/2 c  Salt                                     Flavorings
    1/2 c  Sugar                         

----------------------------------BRINE #2----------------------------------
      4 c  Water                               1 c  Salt, regular or curing
      1 c  Rock salt                                Plus your choice of
      2 c  Brown sugar                              Flavorings
 
  It is recommended that you rub in flavorings just before putting the fish
  into the smoker, although you can also put flavorings into either of the
  above brines; in other words you can prepare a brine marinade flavored with
  garlic, shallots, tarragon, dill, thyme, or whatever you fancy. After
  brining in the flavored brine, fish should washed off and dried before
  smoking.
  
  Smoked fish will keep for a solid year, at least if they are frozen in
  airtight plastic bags from which the air has been exhaled.

      Title: Trout Sauteed in Butter
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Salt and pepper                     6 tb Unsalted butter
      4    Fresh trout, dressed                     Parsley sprigs
           A few Tbsp. flour                        Lemon wedges
 
  As every angler knows, skillet-size brook, brown, and rainbow trout are
  never more tasty than when prepared this way.  Can there be any tastier
  dish than the one that comes from this happy marriage of fresh trout and
  butter?  But for best results, a few words of warning: a basic rule of fish
  cookery is that fish, unless deep fried, should be cooked slowly. Yet, at
  the same time, one wants the flesh moist but with the outside golden brown.
  Furthermore one wants to be able to serve trout whole, not in broken
  chunks, the result of sticking. One other word: since trout are delicately
  flavored, I do not "flour" trout with cornmeal but with flour. However,
  either way, the trout will be delicious. Salt, pepper and coat the trout by
  rolling them in the flour.
     Melt the butter in a big iron skillet.
     When the butter is hot (over medium heat) but has not yet shown color,
  lay in the trout and turn the fire low.  A steady, low heat will do two
  things:  cook the trout slowly  and at the same time brown the trout.
     You must police the process continuously, and it will take 15-20
  minutes, depending on the size of the trout.
     Just as soon as the flour coating has set on the down side, loosen each
  trout from the skillet, shaking the skillet gently to keep the slow
  browning trout free.
     After 10 minutes of slow browning, turn each trout carefully and repeat
  the above process.
     When you serve the trout, pour a bit of the butter over each and garnish
  with a sprig of parsley and a wedge of lemon. SAUTEED QUICK MEUNIERE
  
  
     If you wish, add a couple of pats of butter to the skillet after the
  trout has been served, melt them, squeeze in a tablespoon of lemon juice,
  turn up the heat, and stir.  Then pour this lemon-butter sauce over each
  trout.

      Title: Truite Au Bleu (Blue Trout)
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 tb Butter                            1/2 ts Thyme
      1    Shallot of scallion, minced         2 tb Minced fresh parsley
      1    Rib celery w/leaves/chopped         1    Bay leaf
      1    Carrot, thinly sliced               3 c  Water
      1    Dressed trout, head and all         1 c  White wine or dry vermouth
           But cut into chunks                 3 tb Tarragon vinegar
      1 tb Salt                                5    Whole 10" trout
      6    Peppercorns                    
 
  This dish is basically trout poached in a vegetable court bouillon flavored
  with a cut-up trout.  It is a lovely way to offer the delicacy of trout,
  and can be either a fish course, if the trout are 6-8 inchers, or a main
  course if the trout  are 10-11 inchers. As a fish course for a game dinner
  serve    the trout cold ( in an aspic if you wish-see below).
  
  In a big saucepan or deep skillet with lid melt the butter and saute' the
  vegetables until the shallot is just soft.
     Add the single cut-up trout and the remaining ingredients (except whole
  trout), bring to a bubble, and simmer for ten minutes or so.
     Add the dressed whole trout, cover, and simmer slowly for about
  20-minutes.
     If the dish is a main course, remove the fish, drain, and serve
  immediately with melted butter and lemon juice or herb butter.
     If the dish is just a fish course, allow the fish to cool in the liquor
  and serve the drained trout with a slice of lemon.

      Title: Trout Served Cold in Aspic
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Poached trout                            Parsley
      1 c  Tomato sauce                             Lemon slices
      4 ts Gelatin                        
 
  If you'd like to serve the trout as a fish course in aspic, let the trout
  cool in the liquor, then remove and drain the trout.
     Strain the liquor the trout were simmered in, add to it the tomato
  sauce, and over fire stir in the gelatin.  Stir over low heat just until
  the gelatin melts.  Set gelatin liquid in refrigerator until it cools but
  is not as yet "set."
     Arrange trout in a flat dish, pour over them the aspic, and allow to
  set.
     Arrange parsley and then lemon slices around the trout and serve.

      Title: Trout and Vegetables in Foil
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    10" trout                                Salt and pepper
      2    Carrots                             3    Ribs celery
           Juice of 1/2 lemon                1/2 ts Thyme
      2 sm Onions                              4 ts Butter
 
  This delicious dish can be prepared for a noon campfire if the camp itself
  has a blender or food processor in its kitchen or prepare before the trip
  at home.  If the fish is to be a sizable one, be sure to take enough foil
  in one piece; if the servings are to be individual for each guest, then cut
  the foil accordingly.
  
  Clean the trout and sprinkle inside and out with lemon juice, salt, pepper
  and herbs.
     Put vegetables through the food processor, mix well and strain.
     Saute vegetables in butter until they are soft, and stuff each fish
  before wrapping loosely in foil.
     Place in ashes or on cookie sheet in 450 degree oven for 15-20 minutes.
  Serve.

      Title: Filleted Trout with Macadamia Nuts and Fried Capers
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4 tb Butter                            1/4 c  Macadamia nuts, sliced
           Splash of dry white wine            3 tb Heavy cream
      2    Trout filleted                           Oil for deep frying
    1/4 c  Fish stock, OR half clam          1/8 ts Tomato sauce
           Juice, half water                   2 tb Capers
           Salt and fresh pepper          
 
  A very special way a doing trout fillets, inspired by a dish created by
  chef Seppi Renngli at the Four Seasons. In a skillet large enough to hold
  the fillets melt about 3 tablespoons butter and, when almost sizzling, add
  trout.  Saute on one side for about 3-minutes, turn, cover for a minute,
  and then saute the other side. A total of 6-7 minutes should do it.
    Salt and pepper the fish and remove to a warm place, add nuts for a
  moment to the pan to toast, then toss over the trout fillets.
    Meanwhile, in a separate small, sturdy pan, heat enough oil so that a
  small strainer can be lowered into it.
    Let capers drain in the strainer.
    Returning to the trout pan, splash in tablespoon or two of wine, then add
  stock and cream and boil down rapidly, stirring in just a taste of the
  tomato paste and a little more butter. When reduced and slightly thickened,
  spoon this little bit of pan sauce over the fillets.
    Now quickly lower the capers into the almost smoking oil. Let them
  sputter and sizzle a few seconds, then remove the strainer and shake free
  of oil.  Distribute fried capers in neat piles at either end of the fillets
  and serve immediately.

      Title: Trout Crepes
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 20 servings
 
-----------------------------------CREPES-----------------------------------
      4    Eggs                                1 c  Flour
      1 c  Water                         

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
    1/3    Minced onion                      2/3 c  Sauterne
    1/4 ts Pepper                            1/4 c  Flour
      1    Clove garlic, minced                4 c  Cooked, skinned, deboned
  1 1/3 c  Milk                                     Trout
    1/3 c  Butter                            1/2 ts Salt
 
  In cooking the crepes, before filling and rolling up with the trout
  mixture, a 6-inch skillet is handy.  Makes 20 crepes. NOTE: To make crepes,
  mix the ingredients for the batter together thoroughly and let rest for at
  least 1 hour. Brush skillet with a little butter, heat until almost
  smoking, and pour enough batter to thinly cover bottom of pan after it is
  tipped to spread evenly to edges. Cook over medium heat, turning when
  bubbles appear on surface; cook other side until lightly browned. Repeat,
  making 20 crepes in all, set aside.
  
  Cook and stir onion and garlic in butter until onion is tender. Remove from
  heat.  Blend in flour, salt, and pepper.  Cook over low heat, stirring,
  until mixture is bubbly.  Remove from heat. Stir in milk and wine. Heat to
  boiling, stirring constantly. Boil and stir 1 minute. Stir in trout pieces.
  Fill each crepe with 2 tablespoons filling. Heat crepes at 350 degree oven
  for 10 minutes. Serve crepes topped with remaining filling.

      4 tb Butter                                   Salt and pepper
      6    Peppercorns                         2 lb Fillets of steelhead
      1 c  Hollandaise sauce **                     Cucumber and lemon slices
      2    Shallots, sliced                    1    Bouquet garni
  1 1/2 tb Flour                             1/4 ts Thyme,
      1 c  Water                             1/2 ts Tarragon
      4 tb Milk                              1/2 lb Mushrooms

-----------------------------HOLLANDAISE SAUCE-----------------------------
      2    Egg yokes                           1 pn Cayenne
           Salt                              1/4 lb Cold butter, 8 pieces
           Fresh lemon juice              
 
  This lordly French dish is prepared in a variety of ways, but basically it
  is fish fillets served with two sauces and mushrooms in between. The
  fillets from small salmon, walleye, lake trout, and channel cat are all
  superb prepared in this fashion.
    If the two sauces seem too time-consuming just note that this dish is
  excellent if only the wine sauce is used.
  
  Put the fish head, etc., peppercorns, and shallots into the water and wine,
  bring to a boil, then simmer gently for 30 minutes. Strain and set aside.
    Arrange the fillets in a shallow glass or earthenware fireproof dish that
  has been liberally buttered.  Add the bouquet garni.
    Pour in the reserved fish stock and poach in a 325 degree oven for 20
  minutes.
    Saute the sliced mushrooms in 2 tablespoons of butter for 5 minutes,
  coating and stirring a couple of times.  Reserve.
    Prepare the hollandaise and hold it by covering with a lid.
    Make the wine sauce by melting 2 tablespoons of butter in pan, then stir
  in the flour and cook a few minutes.  Turn off heat, pour in the liquor
  from the poached fillets, then stir and thicken over the fire. Add the
  milk, then stir until it bubbles. Season to taste.
    To assemble: lay the fillets on a fireproof dish and cover with the wine
  sauce.  Now dot the top with mushrooms.  Ladle the hollandaise sauce over
  all and glaze under the broiler.
    Garnish with cucumber and lemon slices or with watercress.
  
  HOLLANDAISE SAUCE
  
  In a very heavy pot set over a flame tamer, whisk the eggs until they are
  well blended, turn lemon-colored, and start to thicken. Be sure heat is
  low. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice when thickening starts.
    Start adding butter one piece at a time, whisking each piece until is
  absorbed with the eggs.  Continue until all the butter is used up. It
  should take about 2 minutes, at which point the sauce will be thick. If at
  any point you sense that the is about to separate, quickly add a teaspoon
  of cold milk or cream.
    Now whisk in about 1 more teaspoon of lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and
  optional cayenne.  Taste to see that the sauce is lemony enough for your
  taste.

      Title: Trout Stuffed Japanese Style
 Categories: Fish/sea, Japanese
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/4 lb Mushrooms, sliced                        Skin, head and tail
      2 tb Vegetable oil                       3    Scallions, cut in 1/2"
      1 c  Seeded, sliced in 1/4"                   Including greens
      4    Eggs, lightly beaten                8    Strips of bacon
           Strips, red or green pepper         1 c  Bean sprouts
      2 ts Soy sauce                           2    Ribs celery, sliced
      4    Trout, 8-10 oz. boned with     
 
  Mix the vegetables together.  In a large skillet or wok heat oil, then toss
  in the vegetables and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the eggs and soy sauce
  and continue to toss and cook for another minute until eggs begin to
  coagulate.
    Stuff each of the 4 trout with one-fourth of the vegetable mixture--the
  filling will expand the opening by about an inch. Wrap 2 slices of bacon
  around each trout, tucking the ends under the trout.
    Bake in a large baking dish so trout are not touching in preheated 500
  degree oven about 15 minutes, until skin is crisp and the fish is opaque to
  the bone.  Test after 12 minutes. Vegetables will remain crisp.

      Title: Baked Stuffed Lake Trout, Salmon, or Walleyed Pike

      1 ts Salt                                1    Stuffing recipe
      1    Carrot, thinly sliced               1    Bay leaf
           White pepper                    1 1/2 c  White wine
      1    Rib celery, thinly sliced           1    Lemon, sliced very thin
      6 lb Fish, dressed                       4 tb Butter, melted
    3/4 ts Dried marjoram                      2    Shallots, thinly sliced

------------------------------CELERY STUFFING------------------------------
    3/4 c  (4 ribs)                          1/2    Chopped onions
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs                      1/4 ts Savory
           Chopped celery                      4 tb Butter
           Salt and fresh black pepper       1/4 c  Chopped celery tops

-------------------------FENNEL / TARRAGON STUFFING-------------------------
      2 tb Chopped parsley                     6 tb Butter, melted
    1/2 ts Fennel seed                     1 1/2 c  Roughly torn fresh
      2 tb Chopped fresh tarragon                   Bread crumbs
           Salt and fresh pepper          
 
  Marjoram goes well with fish, and here's a recipe that uses it both in and
  on the fish.  Neither lake trout nor salmon need be scaled, but do scale
  the pike.  A whole baked fish on a garnished platter always looks good to
  guests. Salt and pepper the fish inside and out, then stuff it and sew up
  or skewer the opening.
    Place in a buttered pan and lay lemon slices along its length. Stick a
  toothpick in each slice.
    Add the vegetables, marjoram, bay leaf, and white wine and bake,
  uncovered, for about 35 minutes in a 400 degree oven, basting first with
  the melted butter and then with the liquid in the pan. CELERY STUFFING
  Saute the chopped celery and onions in butter in a small skillet for 15
  minutes, until tender but still with a little bite.
    Add the chopped celery tops and the bread crumbs.  Season to taste with
  salt, pepper, and savory.  Makes 1 cup. FENNEL SEED AND TARRAGON STUFFING
  
  Mix all ingredients together and stuff fish.

      4    1-lb. bass, dressed and             4 tb Butter
           And skinned                              Salt and fresh pepper
 
  This recipe includes a very simple sauce that enhances sauteed, broiled or
  baked fish.  It can be made in camp if you brought parsley and usually
  impresses any old "fried fish angler."
  
  Make the sauce first.
    In a bowl set the butter out to soften.  Then cream it with a fork and
  then a spoon until it is light and fluffy.  Work in the salt and pepper.
    Mix the smashed garlic and the lemon juice, then work this liquid into
  the butter.  Take a bit of time to do this.
    Mix in the parsley and serve in a gravy boat with a spoon.
    Pan fry the bass remembering to brown the fish on both sides but not to
  over cook.
    Serve hot on hot plates and pass the sauce.

      1 c  Boiling water                       6 tb Olive oil
      4    Walleyes, cleaned                   2 tb Capers
      2    Bay leaves                          2    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 tb Flour for dredging                  3 tb Chopped parsley
    1/2 ts Thyme                               1 c  Red wine
      1    Onion, minced                  
 
  Salt and pepper the fish and dredge in flour.  Shake off excess.
    In a heavy saucepan saute the onion in 2 Tbs. olive oil. When
  translucent, add the garlic and slowly saute another minute. Stir in 2
  tablespoons flour, blend well, and cook, stirring for a minute or two. Off
  heat pour in the wine and boiling water; whisk thoroughly. Return to heat,
  whisking as the sauce thickens. Add bay leaves, thyme, and tomato puree.
  Let simmer while you sear the fish.
    In a pan large enough to hold the 4 walleyes in one layer, heat the
  remaining oil and when hot, but nor smoking, sear the fish quickly on each
  side.
    Now, pour the red wine sauce over the fish.  Bring to a boil, then
  quickly lower the heat.  Cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes.
    Just before serving remove the bay leaves, adjust the seasoning (the
  sauce will probably need salt and pepper), toss the capers in, and sprinkle
  with chopped parsley on top.

      2 tb Parsley, minced                   1/2 c  Bread crumbs

      2    Green peppers                  
 
  Roasted peppers lend a wonderful flavor to fish dishes.  Prepare this dish
  in a shallow baking dish or baked in individual gratin dishes if available.
  Wash and pat the fillets dry, then dice into 1-inch squares. Season with
  salt and pepper.
    Wash, then dry the green peppers and roast them under the broiler,
  turning them as the skin blackens.  Place the peppers in a paper bag, seal
  by twisting the top, and set aside for 5 minutes or so. Then remove and,
  with finger, push and pinch off most of the blackened skin. Cut in half,
  remove the seeds and stems and slice into thin strips.
    Put the oil in a big skillet and saute the garlic until it is
  translucent.  Then scrape in the fillet squares from your cutting board,
  turn up the heat, and cook, stirring constantly for about 5 minutes.
    Off heat, add and mix thoroughly the peppers, parsley, capers, and half
  the bread crumbs into which you have mixed the thyme. Spoon into baking
  dish and sprinkle the rest of the crumb-thyme mixture over all, and place
  under the broiler for a minute or two to brown. Serve with tossed salad and
  baked potatoes.

      Title: Pan Fried or Sauteed Yellow Perch
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 sm Yellow perch                        4 tb Butter
           7-9 " long                               Cornmeal
      4 tb Bacon fat or lard                   1    Lemon (opt.)
           Salt and pepper                
 
  Dress, scale, and what the fish, pat dry, salt and pepper, then dredge them
  in the meal or meal-flour combination.
    Heat the fat until it is hot enough to cook at once, but not burning,
  sputtering hot.  Lay in the fish, turn heat down to barely a medium flame,
  and begin to brown the fish. Keep the fish loose from the pan bottom with a
  thin metal spatula.
    Taking 8-10 minutes to a side (turn heat low if it seems to fry too
  fast), brown the fish slowly until crisp.  Do not overcook. When the flesh
  is opaque the fish is done; one hopes it's all browned by then.
    Add 4 Tbs. butter to the skillet after removing the fish and squeeze in
  the juice of a lemon, stir the fat and juices to loosen the dredgings, and
  pour over the browned fish.
  
  VARIATION:  After removing the fish from the skillet, toss about 1/3 cup of
  chopped black walnuts.  Brown lightly with the remaining butter and
  sprinkle over the fish before serving.

  REMOVE FROM PAN. ALLOW TO COOL BEFORE REMOVING ALUMINUM FOIL.
  NOTE: COATING THE BLUEBERRIES WITH FLOUR STOPS THEM FROM SINKING IN THE
        BATTER. THE ALUMINUM FOIL PREVENTS THE CAKE FROM PULLING APART
        IF ANY OF THE BERRIES STICK, THIS PROVES OUT TO BE BETTER THAN
        GREESING THE PAN. GOOD LUCK, GRANDMA ROSE.

    1/2 lb Feta cheese; crumbled               1 c  Butter; melted
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten                3 tb Butter; melted

  In a bowl combine the cheeses, eggs, flour, salt (unless the feta is very
  salty) nutmeg, and 3 tablespoons butter.  Cover the bowl and chill several
  hours or overnight, removing from the refrigerator an hour before using.
  Cut the filo into thirds (3 x 11 inches).  Pile up the filo, covering it
  with waxed paper and a damp towel.  Take out one sheet at a time and keep
  the rest covered.  Butter the filo, one sheet at a time, using a pastry
  brush and the 1 cup melted butter.  Place 1 teaspoon of the filling 1 inch
  from the end nearest you.  Fold the filo back over the filling so the
  bottom edge meets the left edge, forming a right angle. Continue folding
  back at right angles to make the triangular shape. Bake in a moderate oven
  (350 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden and crisp, turning once.
  Serve hot. Note: Tyropites may be stacked upright in cardboard boxes and
  frozen. When ready to bake, separate while still frozen, spread on baking
  sheets, and bake as directed above, allowing an additional 10 minutes
  baking time.

      Title: Anginares Tarama
 Categories: Ethnic, Appetizers, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 sm Fresh globe artichokes              2 lg Juicy lemons
  1 1/2 oz Tarama; rinsed if necessary         1 c  Fruity olive oil
           -=OR=-                                   Salt
      2 oz -Smoked skinned cod's roe                Freshly ground white pepper
      1 tb Finely grated onion pulp       
 
  To clean the artichokes, cut off the stems flush with the base, remove any
  tough, unsightly outer leaves and cut off the top one-third of the flower
  bud itself.  Force the leaves open a little, and rinse under cold water,
  with a squeeze of lemon or a splash of vinegar to prevent discoloring.
  
  Place the artichokes upside-down in a pot large enough to hold them all in
  one layer and pour in boiling water to come one-fourth of the way up the
  sides.  Salt and simmer 15-40 minutes, depending on their age and size -
  until the heart is just tender when pricked with a fork.  Drain and refresh
  them under cold water; drain again and chill.
  
  Beat the tarama or smoked cod's roe with the grated onion.  You can do this
  easily in a food processor.  Finely grate the zest of one lemon and beat
  in, with 2 teaspoons boiling water.
  
  Squeeze the juice of both lemons.  Alternately dribble in lemon juice and
  olive oil, beating each addition in before adding the next, as though
  making mayonnaise - it may not need all the oil.  If you are doing this by
  hand, it take perseverence and elbow grease to make it nice and light.
  Taste and season with pepper.  Open the artichokes and remove the inner,
  soft leaves and then the hairy choke.  Spoon tarama into the cup of leaves.

           - trimmed, cut                           Chopped fresh mint
 
  Heat the fat in an enameled pan and mix in the tomato juice or sauce.  Add
  the green beans and parsley to the pan with enough water to almost cover.
  Tuck the potato slices in between, partially cover the pan, and simmer for
  25 minutes, the stir and season with salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons
  chopped mint.  Cook uncovered until the beans and potatoes are fork tender,
  about 10 more minutes.  If the sauce has not thickened, pour it into a
  small pan, and boil down to one cup, then combine with the beans and
  potatoes in a warm serving bowl.  Sprinkle with a little additional fresh
  mint and serve warm.  Excellent with grilled chops, fish or egg dish, but
  equally good as a main course with cheese.

      1 c  Chopped spring onions               8    Fillo pastry sheets
    1/3 c  Olive oil                                Olive oil or butter
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley                
 
  Serves 6-10 Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 50 minutes
  
  Wash spinach well and cut off any coarse stems.  Chop coarsely and put into
  a large pan. Cover and place over heat for 7-8 minutes shaking pan now and
  then or turning spinach with a fork.  Heat just long enough to wilt spinach
  so that juices can run out freely.  Drain well in a colander, pressing
  occasionally with a spoon.
  
  Gently fry the onion in olive oil for 10 minutes, add chopped leek and
  spring onions and fry gently for further 5 minutes until transparent.
  
  Place well-drained spinach in a mixing bowl and add oil and onion mixture,
  herbs and nutmeg.  Blend thoroughly, adding salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Place a sheet of fillo pastry on work surface and brush lightly with olive
  oil.  Top with 3 more sheets of pastry, brushing each with oil.  Brush top
  layer lightly with oil and place half the spinach mixture along the length
  of the pastry towards one edge and leaving 4 cm (1-1/2-inches) clear on one
  side.  Fold bottom edge of pastry over filling, roll once, fold in sides
  then roll up.  Place a hand at each end of roll and push it in gently like
  a concertina.  Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.
  
  Place rolls in an oiled baking dish leaving space between rolls.  Brush
  tops lightly with oil and bake in a moderate oven for 30 minutes until
  golden.  Serve hot cut in portions.

     25    Saffron strands; soaked in        1/2 c  White wine
    1/4 c  Hot water                         1/4 c  Orange juice
    1/4 lb Finely chopped onion                1    Bay leaf
      1 md Leek; washed, finely chopped             Salt & freshly ground Pepper
      8 tb Fruity olive oil                  1/2 c  Finely chopped Fennel
      3    Garlic cloves; minced             1/2 c  Minced flat-leaf Parsley
      1 lb Tomatoes; skinned, seeded,          1 tb Finely chopped fresh Mint
           - and finely chopped                     Saffron Rice
 
  If you have live lobsters, plunge them into a pan of boiling water for 1
  minute, then into cold water.
  
  To prepare the lobsters, break off the claws and crack them open with a
  hammer.  Cut off the tip of the tail (with the fins), then sever the tail
  where it joins the head with a heavy knife.  Cut the tail into rings,
  slicing through the shell between the ribs.
  
  Split the head open lengthwise with a hard blow of a knife and remove and
  discard the gritty stomach sac.  Pour the coral (if any) and the green
  matter (which is the liver) into a stainer over a bowl, sprinkle with salt
  and pepper, and reserve.  Put the saffron to soak.
  
  In a heavy-bottomed pan big-enough to contain the lobsters and sauce, fry
  the onion and leek gently in 3 tablespoons olive oil until translucent. Add
  the garlic, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and liquid, wine, orange juice,
  and bay leaf.  Season and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.
  
  Add the fennel, parsley, mint, saffron and liquid, and lobster tail pieces
  and claws with their shells (but not the legs) and simmer, covered, for 10
  minutes.
  
  In the meantime push the coral and liver of the lobster through the
  strainer and beat the pure with the remaining olive oil.  When the lobster
  has simmered for 10 minutes, ladle out about 1 cup sauce and beat this into
  the coral pure.  Pour this back into the pot, stir, and simmer for another
  10 minutes.  Serve with saffron rice.

      Title: Souvlaki with Tzaziki
 Categories: Ethnic, Lamb
      Yield: 1 servings
 
----------------------------------SOUVLAKI----------------------------------

           -Sirloin tip;cut in 1 1/2"               -3 tsp
           -chunks                           1/4 c  Olive oil
      2 c  Red wine;dry                             -Sweet peppers and cherry
      2    Garlic cloves; minced                    -tomatoes as needed
      1 ts Oregano;dried                 

----------------------------------TZAZIKI----------------------------------
      2 c  Yogurt;pain                         2    Garlic cloves;minced
    1/2    Cucumber;English,peeled &           3 tb Olive oil
           -grated                             1 ts -salt
 
  "Begin preparing the tzazik a few hours before serving. The flavours need
  time to blend. Marinate the meat overnight to absorb the wine and garlic."
  
  Souvlaki: Place the meat in a large bowl. Pour in the wine and sprinkle
  minced garlic and oregano. Imbed the lemon strips among the cubes of meat
  and drizzle with olive oil. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate
  12 hours or overnight. Shake or stir the mixture several times during the
  marination period.
    About 30 minutes before serving, drain off and discard the marinade.
  Thread the chunks of meat onto long skewers, brushing with a little olive
  oil. (We usually BBQ the peppers and tomatoes on separate skewers but it's
  really up to the chef.)
    Over medium coals, barbeque the souvlaki until it's done the way you like
  it. Serve on a bed of rice and pass the tzaziki to sppon on top. SERVES 4-6
  
  Tzaziki: Line a colander or sieve with cheesecloth (or gauze) and set it
  over a bowl. Pour in the yogurt and allow it to drip for an hour or so.
  After the yogurt has drained, combine it, in a small bowl, with the
  cucumber and the garlic. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate until just before serving. While the meat is BBQing, drizzle
  the olive oil over the surface, and without stirring, sprinkle on the salt.
  It needs no mixing - your guest will do that when they dollop it onto their
  souvlaki. MAKES: About 3 cups

      Title: Taramosalata
 Categories: Ethnic, Appetizers
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      3 sl French or Italian bread;-OR-        1    Lemon's juice (or more)
      2 md -Potatoes, boiled & peeled          2 tb Vinegar
      5 oz Tarama (fish roe)                   1 tb Water (more if necessary)
      1 c  Olive oil                         1/2    Onion, (optional); grated
 
  Soak the tarama in warm water a few minutes, then rinse and drain. If using
  bread slices, discard crusts, soak bread in water, then squeeze dry. Using
  an electric blender or electric mixer (or old-fashioned mortar and pestle),
  thoroughly blend the bread or potatoes and the tarama. Add the olive oil as
  slowly as possible, blending at medium speed, plus a little water if the
  mixture forms peaks. Add the grated onion, if desired, then whip at high
  speed for a few minutes.
  
  Note: The flavor may be mitigated to suit taste by adding more bread or
  potato; a too-salty taste may be adjusted by dropping in a few tablespoons
  of sour cream while blending. Leftover taramasalata can be stored in a
  covered jar in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days.

  1 1/4 c  Butter ; softened                 1/2 ts Baking soda
      4 ts Cinnamon; ground (or more)          6 c  Flour; all purpose (or more
  1 1/2 c  Oil; vegetable                      2 oz Walnuts; finely chopped
    1/2 c  Sugar; icing                   
 
  (Author's Note): Ancient and traditional small, spicy baked syruped cakes,
  these are perfect for a large buffet.  The nickname asserts their
  introduction into Greece by the Phoenicians, but not with these
  ingredients!  Within my lifetime I have seen the oil give way to butter and
  semolina succumb to flour. Combine the honey, granulated sugar, water, and
  lemon juice in a saucepan and boil for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
  Combine the 1 pound finely chopped walnuts with 1/4 cup of the softened
  butter, 2 teaspoons of the cinnamon, and 5 tablespoons of the syrup.
  Reserve the remaining syrup and set the filling aside while you prepare the
  dough. Using an electric mixer, cream the remaining butter (1 cup) with the
  oil until light and fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar, beating
  on medium speed.  Add the orange juice slowly to the batter, along with the
  Cognac or brandy, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and the other spices. In a
  small bowl, sift the baking powder, soda, and 2 cups of the flour together.
  Slowly add the flour mixture to the batter and beat for a few minutes.
  Continuing to mix by hand, add only enough remaining flour to make a soft
  dough.  Knead. Break off small pieces of the dough and shape with your
  fingers into oblongs about 2-1/2-inches long and 1-inch high. Flatten
  between your palms and place 1 teaspoon of the filling mixture in the
  center.  Work the dough around the filling to enclose it completely and
  press firmly to seal. This procedure sounds difficult, but with many hands
  it is quite simple. Place on a cookie sheet and continue until all the
  cakes are shaped.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes, then
  cool on a rack.  Bring the syrup back to a boil.  Dip each cake into the
  syrup and arrange on a platter.  Sprinkle with the remaining chopped
  walnuts and teaspoon cinnamon, or more if desired.  Cool before storing.
  
  Note: You may bake and cool melomakarona, store a few days in advance and
  dip in syrup as described above a day or so before serving.  The flavor
  improves after a few days.

  In a medium bowl place the cinnamon and walnuts, and mix them together.
  
  Brush the bottom of a 14" x 20" baking dish with the butter.  Place one

  this process so that there are 3 layers of the nut mixture and 4 layers of
  6 buttered pastry sheets, ending with 6 pastry sheets.
  
  Cut the baklava into 40 diamond shaped pieces.  Insert a whole clove in the
  top of each piece.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Bake the baklava for 40 minutes, or until it is
  golden brown.  In a medium saucepan place the sugar, water, orange peel,
  lemon peel, and cinnamon stick.  Bring the ingredients to a boil and then
  simmer them for 5 minutes.
  
  Add the honey and bring the mixture to a boil.  Remove the pan from the
  heat and add the lemon juice.  Stir the ingredients together and then let
  the syrup cool.  Remove the orange and lemon peels, and the cinnamon stick.
  
  Spread the cool syrup over the hot baklava.  Cover the dish with a towel
  and let it sit for 1 hour before serving.

      Title: Galaktoboureko
 Categories: Ethnic, Desserts
      Yield: 20 servings
 
      6 c  Milk                                1 tb Butter
      1 c  Fine semolina                      12    Commercial filo sheets
  3 1/2 tb Cornstarch                        3/4 c  Butter; melted & hot
      3 c  Granulated sugar                    1 c  -Water
    1/4 ts -Salt                               1    Lemon or orange (peel only)
      6    Eggs                                2 tb Fine brandy or cognac (opt.)
      1 ts Vanilla extract; opt           
 
  In a heavy-bottomed, 3-quart saucepan, bring the milk gradually to a boil;
  do not allow it to scorch.  Meanwhile, sift the semolina, cornstarch, 1 cup
  of the sugar, and salt together and gradually add to the boiling milk,
  stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Cook slowly over medium heat
  until the mixture thickens and comes to a full boil, then remove from the
  heat. Beat the eggs on high speed of an electric mixer. Gradually add 1/2
  cup sugar and continue beating until very thick and fluffy, about 10
  minutes, then add the vanilla.  Stirring constantly, add eggs to the hot
  pudding. Partially cover the pan and allow to cool.  Butter a 9 x 12 x
  3-inch baking pan and cover the bottom with 7 sheets of the filo, brushing
  butter generously between each and making sure that a few sheets come up
  the pan sides.  Pour the custard into the pan over the filo. Cover with the
  5 remaining sheets, brushing butter between each and on the surface. With
  the tip of a very sharp knife, score the top filo sheets into square or
  diamond shapes, being careful not to score as deeply as the custard. Bake
  on the center rack of a moderate (350 F) oven for 40 to 45 minutes, until
  crisp and golden chestnut in color and the custard is firm. Meanwhile, boil
  the remaining 1-1/2 cups sugar with the water and lemon or orange peel for
  5 minutes.  Add the brandy or Cognac, if desired, and set aside. Remove the
  galaktoboureko from the oven and set on a cake rack.  Spoon the hot syrup
  over the entire galaktoboureko, particularly the edges. Cool thoroughly
  before cutting and serving.  Store in the refrigerator. From: "The Food of

      Title: Baklava (Low Fat Low Cal Version)
 Categories: Ethnic, Desserts, Low-cal, Greek
      Yield: 35 servings
 
    1/2 lb Shelled pistachio nuts,           1/2 lb Filo dough
           -ground                           1/2 c  Low-calorie margarine,
      3 tb Sugar                                    -melted
    3/4 ts Ground cinnamon                          Rose Water Syrup
  1 1/2 tb Rose water                               Whole cloves,optional
 
  This rich-tasting baklava contains half the amount of sugar and a fraction
  of the fat you would normally use, thanks to reduced fats, sugar, and nuts.
  The results will fool anyone.
  
  1. Combine pistacho nuts, sugar, cinnamon and rose water in small bowl.
  Using half of filo sheets (cover remaining with plastic wrap to prevent
  from drying out), place 3 sheets in bottom of lightly greased 13x9" baking
  sheet. Brush with some of margarine. Sprinkle evenly with nut mixture.
  Place remaining sheets over nut filling, brushing after every third sheet
  and top sheet. 2. Cut baklava at 1-1/2" intervals diagonally to form
  pattern of about 35 diamond shapes. Bake at 400'F. 25 minutes or until
  golden. Place on wire rack to cool. Drizzle Rose Water Syrup evenly over
  top and allow to soak several hours. Stud each diamond-shape with whole
  clove.
  
  Each piece baklava with syrup contains about: 85 calories; 32mg sodium; 0
  cholesterol; 5 grams fat; 9 grams carbohydrate; 2 grams protein; trace
  fiber.
  
  Exchanges: 1/2 bread; 1/2 fat.

      Title: Irish Brown Bread #1 Monica Sheridan
 Categories: Breads, Irish
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 c  Stone Ground                    1 1/2 ts Salt
           Whole wheat flour               1 1/2 ts Baking soda
      2 c  White flour                         2 c  Buttermilk or sweet milk
 
  Mix the whole wheat flour throughly with the white flour, salt, and soda.
  
  Make a well in the center and gradually mix in the liquid. Stir with a
  wooden spoon. You may need lass, or more liquid - it depends on the
  absorbent quality of the flour. The dough should be soft but managable.
  
  Knead the dough into a ball in the mixing bowl with your floured hands. Put
  on a lightly floured baking sheet and with the palm of your hand flatten
  out in a circle 1 1/2 inches thick. With a knife dipped in flour, make a
  cross through the center of the bread so that it will easily break into
  quarters when it is baked.
  
  Bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake
  a further 15 minutes.
  
  If the crust seems too hard, wrap the baked bread in a damp tea cloth.
  Leave the loaf standing upright until it is cool.
  
  The bread should not be cut until it has set - about 6 hours after it comes
  out of the oven.

  Layer the veggies and meat (in that order), mix flour and seasonings and
  sprinkle over each meat layer.  Sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce, pour
  stewed tomatoes over all, cover and cook on Low 10-12 hours.
  
  Variable amounts are for 3-1/2 or 5 quart pots.  I make mine up the night
  before and refrigerate.  My hubby (an early riser) puts it on about 7 AM
  and it cooks all day.  There is lots of gravy, which may be thickened with
  cornstarch if de- sired. Sometimes instead of potatoes, I cook large elbow
  macaroni separately (Muellers Ready-cut) and put the  >>>>>> leftover
  macaroni in the bowl with leftover stew to soak up the good gravy. I also
  add a drained can of cut green beans to the veggies (during the last 4
  hours) in that case.

      Title: French Fantan Rolls
 Categories: Breads, French
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      1 c  Milk, scalded                       4 lg Eggs, beaten
    1/2 c  Butter (1 stick)                  1/2 ts Butter extract (DON'T OMIT!)
    1/2 c  Sugar, granulated                 1/8 ts Lemon extract (optional)
      1 ts Salt                                6 c  Bread flour (approximately)
      2 tb Yeast, active, dry (2 pkgs)       1/4 c  Butter, melted
    1/4 c  Water (105- to 115-degrees)    
 
   Combine milk, butter, sugar and salt in a small saucepan.
   Stir until the butter melts. Cool mixture to 105- to
   115-degrees, use a thermometer.
  
   Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water in a large mixing
   bowl. Stir in the milk mixture, eggs, butter extract
   and lemon extract (if used). Gradually stir in enough
   flour to make a soft dough. I usually start out with
   5-1/2 cups and add more until the dough is no longer
   sticky and is soft and silky.
   Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead
   until smooth and elastic (or let your mixer do the work),
   about 5 minutes.
  
   Place dough into a large greased bowl, turning to coat
   the top with oil. Cover and let rise in a warm place until
   double in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
   Punch down dough to get out the air bubbles. NOW, you
   can either make the "fan-shaped" rolls (I don't, they
   take too long) or any shape you'd like. I usually make
   "clover" shaped rolls. If you'd like the "fan-shape"
   directions, let me know and I'll post that later. You can
   make one small lemon sized ball per roll or make 3
   walnut-sized balls per roll (for the cloverleaf rolls).
   Place one ball of dough or 3 walnut-sized balls per roll
   into LARGE greased muffin cups. If you'd like (it's not
   necessary), roll the balls of dough in the melted butter
   before putting them into the pans.
  
   Cover and let rise in a warm place to rise for about 30
   minutes or until double in size. The rolls will "balloon"
   in size once you put them into the oven, don't let the
   risen size fool you, they DO get BIG.
  
   Preheat oven to 425-degrees.
  
   Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
  
   After the first rising, punch down the dough and divide it
   in half. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board.
   Roll EACH half into a 12 x 6-inch rectangle. Brush 2
   TBS butter over top of each rectangle. Cut each rectangle
   into six 1-inch strips. Stack 6 strips of dough (or lay
   them side-by-side, it's easier to me), butter-side up
   on top of one another. Cut each stack into 12 pieces,
   about 1-inch wide. Place stacks of dough into well
   buttered LARGE muffin cups (sideways). Follow rising
   directions in the recipe.

      Title: Halloween Punch
 Categories: Beverages, Desserts
      Yield: 24 servings
 
 
  12	oz	orange juice concentrate, frozen 12	oz	grape juice, white, bottle
  2	lt	7-Up 1	pt	sherbet, lemon or lime 		green food coloring Mix together a
  12 ounce can of orange juice concentrate, a 12 ounce bottle of white grape
  juice, 2 liter bottle of 7-Up, pint of lemon or lime sherbet, and several
  drops of>> green food coloring (rum or vodka to taste, optional). If
  desired, serve with large, buoyant, and well-washed plastic spiders on the
  top!
  
  Here are some other good ideas from the book which you could also use as a
  contest or conversation starter.  (My idea)
   l.  Turn sandwiches intoi jack-o'lanters! Cut eyes, nose, and mouth into
  the top layer of bread and let the top layer (preferably much darker--or
  much lighter--than the bread show through. 2. Make edible spiders for
  Halloween treats: a prune for the body, licorice slivers or stick pretzels
  for the legs, and two "red-hots" for the eyes,]
   3.  Turn apples into jack-o'-lanterns!  Using a sharp knife or razor,
  carefully cut portions of the skin away to make eyes, nose, and mouth.
   For a Halloween dessert, make an edible with's hat using a large, flat,
  dark cookie for the brim and an ice-cream sugar cone for the crown. Fill
  the cone with ice cream even to the rim and center it on top of the cookie.
  To enhance the illusion, consider giving the top of the cookie, a thin
  layer of chocolate frosting.     >>> 4. A plain sour-cream based chip or
  vegetable dip can quickly be transformed into a delightfully ghoulish
  Halloween dip by adding a fre drops of freen food coloring to the dip
  itself, and then scattering small bits of red and yellow bellk pepper
  across the top.,
   5.  Serve fruit salad in a large, hollowed-out, and well-scrubbed
  pumpking.  Or serve it in a small pumpkins: one for each diner. If desired,
  paint a jack-o'-lantern on the pumpkin shell.

      Title: Irish Soda Bread #1
 Categories: Breads, Irish
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Flour                             1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
    1/2 ts Sugar                           1 1/4 c  Buttermilk:  to 2 1/2 c *
    1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  * You will need somewhere between these two amounts of buttermilk,
  depending on how much liquid your flour tends to absorb. Try to avoid using
  regular milk: if you must, use baking powder instead of bicarbonate of
  soda. -- Lightly grease a heavy skillet (if making "soda farl", the flat
  version of soda bread) or preheat the oven to 450 F (if making "soda cake",
  the round, more breadlike version.) Sift the dry ingredients together into
  a large bowl; make sure the soda is evenly distributed. Make a well in the
  center of the dry mixture and add about half the buttermilk. Stir until you
  have a raggy dough that is very squashy but which looks more or less dry.
  Add more liquid sparingly until you achieve this texture. Blend until all
  the flour has achieved this consistency; then turn out immediately onto a
  lightly floured board and knead ***for no more than a minute or a minute
  and a half***. Overkneading makes this bread very tough, and it's very easy
  to overdo it. If making soda cake, shape the dough into a circle about 8-9
  inches across and about an inch and a half thick. Cut a cross about on the
  top, about half an inch deep, and place on a floured baking sheet. Bake at
  450 F for 45-50 minutes. If making soda farl, shape the dough into a circle
  about 9 inches by one inch thick and cut into four wedges or "farls": place
  in the preheated skillet, with cut edges about half an inch apart. Cook
  slowly on the stovetop over low-to-medium heat: it should take about 20
  minutes for the farls to puff up and turn a light brown on the pan side.
  Turn them and cook for another 20 minutes. -- For a softer crust on either
  soda cake or soda farl, wrap in a dishtowel after baking. -- For more
  information on making sodabread and its variations, please see the file
  "SODABRED.TXT" included with this zipfile.

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
      2 ts Irish Whisky                        2    Ilk
 
  BREAD:  In large bowl, combine flour, salt and baking soda.  With pastry
  blender or two knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
  Stir in raisins or currants (if using).  In separate bowl, combine
  buttermilk, honey and whisky.  Add all at once to dry ingredients; stir
  just until no dry spots remain.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured
  surface.  Knead lightly 1 minute (too much handling will toughen loaves,
  while too little will inhibit rising.)  Divide dough in half and shape each
  half into an 8 in (20 cm) round.  Place in two greased 8 in (1.2 L) round
  cake pans.  With floured knife, cut a cross 1/2 in deep in each loaf.
  GLAZE:  In small bowl, combine whisky and milk.  Brush loaves with glaze.
   Bake in 350F (180C) oven 35 to 40 minutes or until loaves sound hollow
  when tapped on bottoms.  Remove from pans; let cool on wire racks.  Cut
  into wedges.

  stuffing, and top  generously with salt pork fat back.  Bake cod with open
  side/salt pork up at 350 Degrees F for one hour or until salt pork is brown
  and crunchy. That's about it, you could sub in bacon for the salt pork, but
  it is good with the salt pork. Enjoy.

      Title: Baked Peameal Bacon
 Categories: Canadian, Meats, Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Peameal Bacon, 1 centre cut              -piece
 
  "Peameal bacon is a unique Canadian meat, pickled but unsmoked loin of pork
  rolled in cornmeal. Usually it is sliced and fried for breakfast but it
  excellent baked whole. The cornmeal makes a crisp exterior and the meat,
  although quite lean, is particularly juicy, because of the pickling
  process. For baking it is important to select a piece from the centre cut,
  with a wide band of lean visible on both ends."
  
  Place in an open roasting pan, fat side up. Bake at 350F degrees for 1- 1/2
  hours. Serve hot in generous slices with baked beans if desired.

  "Blood pudding is one of the great delicacies of Acadian cuisine. It used
  to be that every Acadian family made its own. Since the annual slaughter
  came during Advent, the boudin was usually saved for the Christmas
  holidays." Also part of Cajun cuisine,
  
  Sauce a boudin When slaughtering a pig, collect the fresh blood,
  immediately add salt and stir to prevent coagulation. Cut the fresh pork,
  the lung, heart and neck into large pieces. Place the meat into a large pot
  and add just water to cover the meat. Add the salt and 3 chopped onions.
  Simmer on medium heat for 3 hours. Remove the meat from the cooking liquid
  and let it cool. Cut the meat into very small pieces or grind it with a
  meat grinder. Add the meat to the cooking liquid with the 2 remaining
  onions, pepper and spices. Bring the liquid to a boil and slowly add the
  blood by pouring it through a sieve. Stir constantly. Add the flour, mixed
  with a small amounts of water. (The flour may be browned in the oven before
  being add to the meat, provided that slightly more flour is used.) Simmer
  the mixture on low heat for approximately 1 hour, stirring frequently. This
  sauce may served later by warming in a skillet.
  
  Boudin des Branches (Blood Pudding Sausages) To make blood pudding
  sausages, prepare blood pudding sauce but do not simmer for the last half
  hour. Rather, clean the small intestines of the pig, cut them into 20 inch
  pieces at tie them at one end. Using a funnel or a piece of birch bark as
  was the Acadian tradition, fill the intestinal lining with the sauce until
  the intestine is three quarters full. press out the air and tie the other
  end, leaving some space for expansion. Put the branches (sausages) in
  boiling water and cook for 45 to 1 hour.

  creation of Chef Denis Pelletier of Moulin de St. Laurent, a contemporary
  French restaurant located in an old stone mill in the village of St.
  Laurent on Ile d'Orleans. Ramekins can be filled ahead and oven poached at
  the last minute, or you can reheat the cooked flan in a microwave oven for
  about 2 minutes at Medium (50 percent).
  
    Cook brocolli florets in boiling salted water just until tender-crisp;
  drain. Generously brush 6 to 8 ramekin or custard cups with melted butter.
    Divide crab meat with brocolli among the ramekins. In a bowl, whisk
  together the eggs, cream and milk; season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
  Fill ramekins three-quarters full with the custard and set in a shallow pan
  of hot water. Oven poach for 1 hour at 325F or until set. (A knife inserted
  in centre should come out clean.)
    Make Lemon Butter Sauce and pour onto 6 to 8 serving plates. Run a knife
  around the edge of each ramekin and unmold onto sauce.
  
  Lemon Butter Sauce:
    In small saucepan, heat wine and chopped shallot. Bring to a boil and
  reduce over medium-high heat until only 2 tablespoons of liquid remain.
  Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, a few pieces at a time, until sauce
  is smooth and all the butter is incorporated. Whisk in cream and lemon
  juice. Keep warm in the top of a double boiler set over hot water until
  serving time. MAKES: about 1 1/2 CUPS SAUCE
  
  SERVES: 6-8 as an appetizer

      Title: Crepes a la Neige (Crepes with Snow)
 Categories: Ethnic, Desserts
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Flour                             1/2 ts -Salt
  1 1/4 c  Milk                                1 c  Oil
      1 c  Snow, fresh, hard packed       
 
  "Throughout Acadia, it was customary to make crepes at Candlemas and
  objects such as medals, wedding rings, buttons or pennies were hidden
  inside and often used to predict the future of those who found them.
  Moreover, since eggs were often scarce this time of year as a substitute
  with spectacular results. Hence some Acadians still describe a snowfall as
  "being enough to make crepes with." This recipe is always called Crepes a
  la neige, even when eggs are used instead of snow."
  
  Mix all the ingredients together to make a smooth dough. Drop a spoonful of
  the batter into 1 inch of hot fat. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side. Serve
  with molasses or grated maple sugar.

  "If there was one dish that could be called typically Acadian, it would
  certainly be Fricot, a soup containing potatoes and meat. The dish has been
  a long time favorite in Acadian households, so much  that the word fricot
  was once synomous with a good meal and a common call for dinner was often,
  "Vous etes invites au fricot!"... This potato fricot was prepared when
  neither meat nor fish were available, and given the tongue-in-cheek name,
  "Weasel Fricot" (Fricot a la Belette). If you ask Acadians about the origin
  of the name, they will smile and say, "Parce que b'lette a passe tout
  drouete (Because the weasel went right on by.)
  
  On Prince Edward it is called Fricot a la bezette (Ninicompoop Fricot)
  where bezette roughly translates as "nincompoop". It is known as butter
  fricot, salted her fricot and potato fricot, and is often served with a
  large slice of buttered bread and molasses."
  
  Handkerchief Dumplings (Pates en Mouchior de Poche) Mix flour with salt.
  Gradually add cold water to the dough as one would when making biscuits.
  Roll the dough fairly thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares and place the
  squares in the fricot. Cover and simmer 7 minutes.
  
  Saute the onion and salted herbs in butter for 1-2 minutes or until the
  onion is golden brown. Add the water, potatoes, salt and pepper, and simmer
  for 20 minutes. To thicken the broth, add dumpling or flour mixed with
  water.

  Gateaux Jos. Louis
  
  Home-made versions of this best selling commercial snacking cake turn up in
  recipe collections throughout the Beauce. A product of the giant Vachon
  bakery at St. Marie, it was launched by founder-bakers Arcade and Rose-Anna
  Vachon who named it for their eldest two sons Joseph and Louis and not, as
  some believe , after the heavyweight boxing champion, Joe Louis. Home
  recipes use a drop-cookie method and -sometimes- a marshmallow filling. The
  baking cake is made  automatically with a diameter of 3 1/2 inches (9 cm).
  To achieve a symmetrical look and a light texture, I adapted a recipe
  belonging to Mariette Scully Bourque of Notre Dame des Pins to the muffin
  tin.
  
  CAKE: Grease 12 medium muffin tins or 24 small ones. In a large bowl, cream
  butter and sugar together until fluffy. Measure milk into a 1 cup measure
  and stir in vinegar, then baking soda. In another bowl, sift or mix
  together flour, baking powder, cocoa powder and salt. Combine dry
  ingredients with butter mixture with milk; stir in vanilla. Fill prepared
  muffin tins half full of batter. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 10
  minutes or until a tester inserted in centre comes out clean. Cool for 10
  minutes in pan. Turn out onto rack and cool completely.
  
  VANILLA FILLING: In top of a double boiler, set over boiling water, combine
  egg whites, granulated sugar, salt and water. With an electric mixer, beat
  until stiff and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and beat in
  vanilla.
  
  CHOCOLATE ICING: Cream soft butter with cocoa powder. Blend in cream and
  vanilla. Stir in sifted icing (confectioner's) sugar until icing is of
  spreading consistency.
  
  Slice cakes in half horizontally. Fill with Vanilla Filling and spread tops
  and sides with Chocolate Icing.

  Tire a la Melasse de Grand-Mere
  
  Quebec's sweet tooth is often satisfied by this old-fashioned candy made
  from molasses and sugar. This recipe belongs to Marguerite Legault, a
  member of Les Fermieres de Thuroso, a rural woman's group in the town on
  the Ottawa River.
  
   In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine molasses, granulated and brown sugars
  and water. Heat to boiling and stir to dissolve sugars. Let mixture boil,
  without stirring, until syrup reaches the hard ball stage (260F/125C) on a
  candy thermometer. Remove from heat, stir in butter, baking soda, and salt.
  Immediately pour onto a buttered marble slab or baking sheet.
    When cool enough to handle, butter hands and gather taffy into a ball.
  Pull taffy between hands and continually stretch and fold again until taffy
  turned lighter in colour (this can take from 5 to 15 minutes.)
    Stretch and twist taffy into a rope about 1 inch thick and cut into
  pieces using buttered scissors. Wrap each piece in waxed paper. MAKES:

  "Salted herbs are a central element in traditional Acadian cuisine; they
  are a basic ingredient in fricot, soups and most dishes which use meat and
  fish. Traditionally made with chives, shallots and onion shoots, salted
  herbs may also contain finely chopped onions."
  
  Layer the ingredients in a stoneware or glass pot. Let the mixture stand

      Title: Jellied Moose Nose
 Categories: Meats, Canadian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Upper jawbone of a moose            1 ts Salt
      1    Onion; sliced                     1/2 ts Pepper
      1    Garlic clove                      1/4 c  Vinegar
      1 tb Mixed pickling spice           
 
  1.  Cut the upper jaw bone of the moose just below the eyes.
  
  2.  Place in a large kettle of scalding water and boil for 45 minutes.
  
  3.  Remove and chill in cold water.
  
  4.  Pull out all the hairs - these will have been loosened by the boiling
      and should come out easily ( like plucking a duck).
  
  5.  Wash thoroughly until no hairs remain.
  
  6.  Place the nose in a kettle and cover with fresh water.
  
  7.  Add onion, garlic, spices and vinegar
  
  8.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the meat is tender.
      Let cool overnight in the liquid.
  
  9.  When cool, take the meat out of the broth, and remove and discard the
      bones and the cartilage.  You will have two kinds of meat, white meat
      from the bulb of the nose, and thin strips of dark meat from along the
      bones and jowls.
  
  10. Slice the meat thinly and alternate layers of white and dark meat in a
      loaf pan.
  
  11. Reheat the broth to boiling, then pour the broth over the meat in the
      loaf pan.
  
  12. Let cool until jelly has set.  Slice and serve cold.
  
  I must confess I have not yet tried this recipe, mainly for lack of a moose
  nose...   But, sometime, maybe...

  "This recipe in some old cookbooks is called Date Sandwich Cake. Other
  variations are Raisin Squares or Fig Squares. .. Date Squares (Matrimonial
  Cake, if you happen to come from the West) are a real nostalgia treat. The
  fillings in the 30s recipes was extremely sweet. Today's versions reduce
  the sugar in the filling, since the dates are sweet enough, and are often
  microwaved. Raisin Puff, an old favorite in P.E.I. is somewhat similar,
  with raisin filling sandwiched between layers of soft cookie dough instead
  of an oatmeal mixture."
  
  Filling: In saucepan, cook dates, sugar, lemon juice and water over medium
  heat, stirring often, until the dates are soft, about 15 minutes. Let cool.
    In a bowl, combine flour, rolled oats, sugar, baking soda and salt; blend
  in butter until mixture is crumbly. Pat half onto bottom of 9 inch square
  pan. Spread filling evenly over the top. Sprinkle with the remaining flour
  mixture, patting lightly. Bake in a 350F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until
  nicely browned. Let cool; cut into squares.

  From Blue Ribbon Cook Book, Winnipeg Manitoba 1905 - Mince Pie Hints Dried
  apples soaked in water a few hours make a very fair substitute for fresh
  apples in mince pies.  Dried cherries and other fruit prepared with sugar
  can be soaked 10-12 hours in a very little water and then both water and
  fruit used instead of raisins.  They will be much cheaper and will answer
  very well.  Economical housewives will often find hints like these very
  serviceable.

-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
      3 c  Flour                               1 ts Sugar
      2 tb Baking powder                     1/2 c  Lard
      1 ts -Salt                               1 c  Milk

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 tb Butter; softened                    1 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Brown sugar                         1 c  -Water
 
  To quote the author Marie Cormier-Boudreau, "These pastries which resemble
  cinnamon rolls, have been made throughout Acadia for many, many years.
  Although they are usually given the colourful name Pet de Soeurs (literally
  nun's fart), they are also be called (sic) Rosettes, Rondelles, Hirondells,
  Bourriques de veilles, Bourriques de soeurs or Bourriques de viarges
  (Rosettes, Slices, Swallows, Old Women's Belly Buttons, Nun's Belly Buttons
  and Virgin's Belly Buttons."
  
  Sift the dry ingredients together. Blend in the lard to form a coarse
  mixture. Gradually add the milk until a soft dough is formed. Roll the
  dough until it is fairly thin, although it should be thicker than a regular
  pie crust. Butter the dough with soft butter, cover with 1/4 inch of brown
  sugar and sprinkle with cinnamon. Roll the dough up like a jelly roll and
  slice into circles about 1/2 inch thick. Pour water into a casserole dish.
  Put the sliced dough into the casserole and bake at 375F for about 30
  minutes or until the pets de soeur are golden brown.
  
  VARIATION: Cranberry jam may be substituted for the sugar and the cinnamon.

  "Although pot-en-pot contains the same ingredients as fricot, the method of
  preparation is significantly different. The most commonly used meats for
  this dish are chicken and hare but beef, pork, duck or goose may also be
  used. In Cheticamp and on the Magadalen Islands, pot-en-pot is called
  Etouffrage."
  
  Poultines Blanches: In a bowl, mix flour with salt and baking powder.
  Gradually add cold water to the dough as one would when making biscuits.
  Roll the dough fairly thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares and place in fricot
  or other dish. Cut the meats into pieces. Place the pieces in a large pot
  with the salted water and bring to a boil. Simmer until the meat is tender.
  Remove the meat from the pot, reserving the stock.
   In the bottom of a second large pot, place a layer of potatoes, a layer of
  meat, a layer of chopped onion Season with salt, pepper and summer savory
  and continue adding until there are no ingredients left.
   Add the stock from the simmered meat and just enough water to cover three
  quarters of the ingredients. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes or until the
  potatoes are tender.
   Add Poutines Blanches (dumplings) 7 minutes before it is ready to be
  served, cover for the remaining 7 minutes.
  
  VARIATIONS: To vary the taste, other spices such as cumin or coriander may
  be added to the pot-en-pot. The meat may be sauteed before being simmered
  to improve it's flavour.  Handkerchief dumplings (included with Fricot a la
  Belette may be layered in with the ingredients at the beginning of the
  cooking time, instead of the dumplings used.

      2 tb Butter; or shortening          
 
  "Potato scones reflect the influence of the Scottish in the Maritimes and
  their adaptibility in using the famous P.E.I. potato...Scones were a
  favorite Scottish tradition. According to _A Treasury of Nova Scotia
  Recipes_ "the difference between bannock and scone (which the Scots rhyme
  with 'on', not 'bone') is that the bannock is a rather large, round cake,
  and the scone is a smaller triangle or 'farl'..But local usages vary
  considerably, Scots being strong individualists.
   A similar recipe for German Buns appears in an Ontario cookbook from the
  Kitchener area, where German settlers were predominant.
   When Their Majesties King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Government
  House in Halifax on June 15,1939, scones were served. And Canadian Brits
  gathered for "tea at the Empress" in Victoria for scones and tea.
  
  In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt; cut in butter until
  mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat eggs lightly; reserve 1 Tbsp. With
  fork, stir into dry ingredients along with milk  and potatoes until well
  moistened. Knead gently on a lightly floured surface about 20 times. Roll
  or pat into circle 1/2 inch thick. Place onto ungreased baking sheet; brush
  with reserved egg yolk and sprinkle with more sugar. Cut into 16 wedges,
  separating slightly. Bake in 425F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until
  lightly browned. MAKES: 16 SCONES

  Pouding Renverse des Bleuets
  
  Lemon-flavoured cake batter baked over fresh blueberries makes a perfect
  dessert. When I was immersed in French language studies at Jonqiere's
  Centre linguistique, Jeannine Renouf treated me to this recipe and also to
  a version that she makes with wild raspberries. It was a delectable kind of
  immersion.
  
    Combine blueberries, 1/4 cup of the sugar and lemon rind in a buttered 8
  inch square baking pan.
    In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, cream
  shortening with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy. Beat in egg and
  vanilla. Add dry ingredients alternately with milk, blending well after
  each addition and finishing with dry ingredients.
    Pour batter over fruit in pan and bake in a preheated 350F oven for about
  40 minutes, or until a tester inserted in centre comes out clean. Let cool
  slightly; turn out onto serving plate. Cut in squares and serve warm or at

      Title: Poutines Rapees
 Categories: Ethnic, Vegetables, Desserts, Pork/ham
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Salt pork, fatty                    4    Potatoes; cooked & mashed
     10    Potatoes; finely grated                  -Salt & Pepper
 
  "For many Acadians living in southeastern New Brunswick, Poultine Rapee,
  potato dumpling dish with a mixture of seasoned pork in the centre, is
  considered a national dish. In other parts of Acadia, these delicacies are
  prepared without the meat and fish is sometimes added to fricot. Although
  the greyish colour and gluey texture of the poutines makes them appear
  somewhat unappetizing, their taste more than compensates for their
  unattractive appearance."
  
  Soak the pork overnight in cold water to remove the salt, and cut into
  cubes. Extract the water from the grated potatoes by putting them in a
  cotton bag and squeezing vigourously. Mix the mashed potatoes with grated
  potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Roll the potato mixture into balls
  resembling small snowballs. Make a hole in the centre of the potato ball
  and add 1 Tbsp of the salt pork. Close the hole and roll the poultines in
  flour. Gently drop the poultines 2 or 3 at a time, into a large pot of
  boiling salted water, ensuring that the water is kept at a rolling boil.
  Simmer the poultines for 2-3 hours. Eat the poultines hot with butter, salt
  and pepper, or as a dessert with sugar and molasses. MAKES: 6 POULTINES

      Title: Salted Herbs
 Categories: Canadian
      Yield: 5 servings
 
      1 c  Chopped fresh chives                1 c  Grated carrots
      1 c  Chopped fresh savoury               1 c  Chopped celery leaves
      1 c  Chopped fresh parsley               1 c  Chopped green onions
      1 c  Chopped fresh chervil             1/4    To 1/2 cup coarse salt
 
  These seasonings seem to be added to a lot of traditional French- Canadian
  recipes. "Herbs preserved with vegetables and salt make a lively seasoning
  for soups-particularly pea soup - sauces, stews and omelettes.  A
  commercial brand, Les Herbes Salees du bas du fleuve, is marketed by J.Y.
  Roy of St. Flavie, Quebec.  This recipe comes from the Metis district."
  
  In a large bowl, combine herbs and vegetables.  Layer 1 inch of herb
  mixture in the bottom of a crock or glass bowl and sprinkle with some of
  the salt.  Repeat layers until all of the herb mixture and salt is used.
  Cover and refrigerate for 2 weeks. Drain off accumulated liquid and pack
  herb mixture into sterilized jars.  Refrigerate until ready to use.  Makes
  about 5 to 6 cups.

  Out of Old Nova Scotia Kitchens by Marie Nightingale shared by Elizabeth
  Rodier Conf: (1010) F-COOKING The book mentions Portable Soup (sometimes
  called Pocket Soup or Glue) that was made by simmering stock for 12 hours
  and then boiling/stirring constantly for 8. Then solid stock was formed
  into small cakes. Sea-faring men and woodsmen could carry them in their
  pockets.
  
  The Public Soup House in Halifax (spring 1818) distributed 100 gallons of
  soup daily made from 50 pounds of beef and vegetables.

      1 tb Butter                            3/4 c  Sour cream
  1 1/2 ts Thyme                               3    Potatoes; peeled, cooked and
  1 1/4 ts Celery salt                              -diced
      2 c  Whipping cream                  1 1/4 c  Milk

      3 oz Lobster meat; cooked &                   Paprika for garnish
 
  "A traditional Atlantic chowder is made with fish or shellfish, canned
  milk, potatoes, onions and is served with a dollop of butter. This version,
  which comes from a Nova Scotia fisherman and uses sour cream, fresh cream
  and thyme, is quite different and very good. When reheated leftover
  chowder, it may be necessary to add a little more milk or cream, because
  the fish and potatoes will have absorbed some of the liquid."
  
  Cook the onion in the butter until transparent. Add the thyme and celery
  salt. Remove from heat. In a saucepan, pour the whipping cream over the
  fish fillets.Cover, bring to a boil and simmer slowly for 10 minutes or
  till the fish flakes easily. Remove the fish with a slotted spoon, then
  break into small pieces and remove any bones. Add the onion mixture and the
  scallops to the poaching liquid. Bring to barely a boil, then simmer for
  about 1 minute or till the scallops are opaque. If the chowder is not to be
  eaten immediately, refrigerate everything at this stage. Just before
  serving, add the fish, lobster, sour cream, potatoes and milk. Heat
  through, but do not allow to boil. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into
  soup bowls. Sprinkle with paprika. Serve immediately. SERVES: 4-6 from the
  Zwicker Inn, Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia

    7/8 c  Water                          
 
  Make on dough cycle. There are several ways to make these one is to cut
  into 12 to 15 equal pieces then roll each into a rope about 6 to 8 inches
  long tie in a knot and pinch ends together and place pinched end side down
  in a lightly greased pan. Let rise till doubled about 45 minutes. The other
  way is to cut up 36 equal pieces and roll into balls then place three balls
  into a muffin tin. Let rise as previously stated. Bake in a preheated 350
  degree oven for 13 to 15 minutes till tops are a golden brown. For the
  sticky part after removal of rolls from oven brush on a mixture of melted
  butter about 1 TBL and 1 Tbl sugar heated in a sauce pan till sugar is
  slightly dissolved let mixture cool some and brush on rolls. These rolls
  are just as good without. They also reheat real well. If you would like to
  make brown and serve rolls bake rolls at 250 for 20 to 30 minutes. DO NOT
  BROWN. Let them cool completely before storing (DO NOT put on the glaze)
  tops of rolls will be slightly tacky will last 5 to 7 days in fridge and a
  month in freezer to bake brown and serve preheat oven to 350 bake 8
  minutes. This dough also make excellent cinnamon rolls roll out dough into
  a rectangle about 1/4 to 1/8 inch thick depend on how many and how big you
  want to make them. Take 1 TBL of soft butter and spread all around leaving
  1/4 inch of edge. Then sprinkle cinnamon all around as much as you want
  then take 1/2 cup brown sugar and sprinkle. You can also add the same
  amount of chopped nuts and raisins. Roll up into a log and cut off about
  1-1/2 to 2 inches and place in a lightly greased pan. Let rise 45 minutes
  and bake 15 to twenty minutes at 350. when somewhat cooled drizzle on a

  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Using a paring knife or vegetable peeler, peel and
  discard outer skin of the pumpkin. Slice the pumpkin into 1/4-inch slices
  and place in a mixing bowl. Add the onion, salt, pepper and butter and toss
  well. Pour contents of the bowl into a 9-inch round or square greased
  baking dish, cover with foil and place in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes.
  Meanwhile, beat eggs, milk and cheese together until smooth. Remove the
  baking dish from the oven, remove the cover and pour the cheese mixture
  over the top. Replace in oven, uncovered, another 20 minutes. The gratin is
  done when it turns golden brown.

      1 tb Olive oil                         1/2 ts Ground black pepper
 
  PLACE BEANS IN A POT with enough water to barely cover, cover the pot and
  cook over low heat until beans are barely soft, about 2 hours. Add water to
  keep the beans just covered as necessary. When beans are done, remove from
  heat, drain and set aside. Meanwhile, cut the stems out of fresh tomatoes
  and plunge them into boiling water for barely 1 minute, or until skins
  crack. Remove from water, peel the tomatoes, cut them in half crosswise and
  squeeze out the seeds. If using canned whole tomatoes, cut them in half and
  squeeze out seeds. Cut each tomato half in quarters and set aside. Cook
  pasta until barely soft according to the manufacturer's directions. Drain
  and mix with the beans. Lay the chard leaves on a work surface and cut out
  the center stem. Roughly chop the leaves and thinly slice the stems. Set
  aside.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine oil and sausages in a Dutch oven, place over
  medium heat and cook 3 minutes. Pour off the fat, add the garlic and cook,
  stirring, another minute. Add the tomatoes, beans and pasta, wine, oregano,
  chard stems, salt and pepper. Cover and place in the oven for 20 minutes.
  When it's time to get dinner on the table, add chopped chard to the
  casserole. If the casserole appears dry, add up to 1 cup water. Replace in
  the oven for 5 minutes. Serve piping hot from the oven and offer grated
  cheese.

  Cook onion in 1/2 the butter until onions are soft.  Add salt, pepper,
  soup, and sour cream.  Stir till mixed.  Pour mixture over the hash browns
  which have been placed in a greased 9x13 casserole dish. Melt the remaining
  butter and mix with the corn flake crumbs and top the casserole. Bake at
  350 F for 35-40 minutes.
  
  Note:  I use 1/2 of the butter listed and usually use margarine. Also it is
  better to take a kitchen form and stir the mixture into the hash browns to
  sort of coat all of them.

      Title: Mixed Grain Mushroom Casserole
 Categories: Casseroles
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 c  Wild rice                                -OR- Oil
    1/2 c  Pearl barley                      1/2 lb Mushrooms; thickly sliced
    1/2 c  Brown rice                      3 1/2 c  Broth
    1/4 c  Oil                                 1 ts Crushed dried thyme
      1 lg Onion; thinly sliced              1/2 ts Crushed dried oregano
      4    Garlic cloves; chopped                   Salt & pepper; to taste
      4 tb Unsalted butter or margarine   
 
  Combine grains in a mixing bowl and set aside. Pour the oil into a 2-3 qt.
  casserole which is safe for both stovetop and oven cooking, and place on
  med. heat. When hot , saute onion and garlic until tender and translucent,
  about 5-6 mins. Add the mixed grains and saute for 1 min., stirring
  constantly.
  
  Meanwhile melt butter or margarine (if using) in a separate pan on med.
  high heat. When hot , add mushrooms and saute quickly, stirring frequently,
  until the shrooms are hot and have just absorbed the "butter" (about 1
  min.). Immediately remove from heat.
  
  Add the broth, herbs, and mushrooms to the casserole with the onions and
  grains, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cover
  tightly (use aluminum foil between pot and cover if necessary for a good
  seal), and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hr.
  
  NOTES: I use alot less oil (only as much as needed to keep things from
  sticking in my cast-iron dutch oven), add hot peppers and fresh herbs
  (rosemary is especially delicious; i dislike dried oregano so i use less or
  none), add soy sauce instead of salt, and saute the mushrooms first in the
  same pan (taking them out when done) so i dont have to wash two pans :^>.
  Frankly i can't see where they get 8 servings from, this lasts me maybe 3
  meals....It's really a hearty dish, so save it for a cold day (some of us
  still have a few left, despite the advent of spring). Enjoy!
  
  (8 servings as a side dish, less as an entree)

      Title: Briami - Greek Vegetable Casserole
 Categories: Vegetarian, Casseroles, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Eggplant                            1 c  Olive oil
      2 lb Zucchini                            4 md Tomatoes
      4 md Potatoes                            2    Garlic cloves
      2    Green peppers                       1 ts Sugar
      1    Red pepper                               Salt & pepper; to taste
      2 md Onions                         
 
  (1)  Prepare the vegetables: Cut the eggplant, zucchini  and  potatoes
     in  bite sized chunks (do not peel the zucchini or the eggplant).
     Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers and slice  them  into
     strips. Peel and slice the onions. Dice the tomatoes.
  
  (2)  Saute' the vegetables except the tomatoes  in  the  olive  oil  in
     small  batches.  Saut' each batch for 2 or 3 minutes, then remove
     from the pan, trying to drain some of the oil so that enough  oil
     is  left  for the next batch. When you're done, most (if not all)
     of the oil should be gone from the pan.
  
  (3)  Place the saute'ed vegetables in a  baking  dish  and  toss  them
     briefly  so  that you won't get only one kind of vegetable in one
     place.
  
  (4)  Add the tomatoes into the pan and saut' for a couple of  minutes.
     Crush the garlic and add to the tomatoes. Add the sugar, salt and
     pepper to taste and simmer for another minute.
  
  (5)  Pour the tomato sauce on top of the vegetables and  bake  at  350
     deg. F or until the vegetables are tender.
  
  (6)  Serve with plenty of fresh bread and,  if  you  like,  some  feta
     cheese on the side.
  
  RATING Difficulty: easy. Time: 30-45 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  Precision: No need to measure.

      Title: Huevos Ranchero Casserole Souffle
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Casseroles, Vegetarian, Mexican
      Yield: 12 servings
 
  1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter; softened                - and minced,   -=OR=-
      6    Bell peppers, about 6" long              - Use pickled jalapenos tha
     12    Eggs; separated                          - have been rinsed
      4 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese                  - and prepared the same way
      2 c  Fresh or frozen corn kernels        1 ts Salt; or to taste
      1 c  Milk                                     Freshly ground black pepper
      2    Fresh jalapeno peppers              6 c  Purchased or homemade salsa
           - seeds & membranes removed              - warmed
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch oven-proof glass or earthenware
  casserole dish. Make an incision along the length of each bell pepper and
  remove the stem, seeds and membranes, keeping the peppers whole. Fill a
  medium-size saucepan or skillet halfway with water and bring it to a boil.
  Add the peppers, let the water return to a boil and cook until the peppers
  are just softened, about 3 minutes. Remove and blot them very dry with
  paper towels. Let them cool completely and then line the bottom of the
  casserole with them. Separate the eggs into 2 large bowls. Beat the yolks
  until smooth, then stir in the cheese, corn, milk, jalapeno peppers and
  salt and black pepper. Whisk the whites until soft peaks form, then fold
  them into the yolk mixture, gently stirring just until almost blended.
  Scrape the mixture into the prepared dish and transfer it to the middle
  rack of the preheated oven. Bake just until the eggs are puffy and the top
  is lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325F and continue
  cooking until the eggs are baked through but not dry, 22 to 25 minutes.
  Test by inserting a knife into the center. It should come out almost clean.
  Remove the pan and let it sit for a few minutes before cutting the
  casserole into 12 rectangles. Serve each portion with some salsa spooned on
  top.

  STOCK:
  
  STOCK:  Place chicken in 6-quart kettle along with the rest of stock
  ingredients.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat; simmer,
  covered, for about 1 hour, or until chicken is tender.  (About 45 minutes
  with 2 smaller chickens.)
  
  Meanwhile, make pastry.  In medium bowl stir flour and salt together. With
  pastry blender, cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.
  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of ice water at a time, over all of pastry mixture,
  tossing lightly with a fork after each addition and pushing dampened
  portion to side of bowl; sprinkle only dry portion remaining. Pastry should
  be just moist enough to hold together, not sticky. (4 to 6 tablespoons ice
  water.) Shape into a ball; flatten and wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate
  until ready to use.
  
  Remove chicken from kettle to bowl; cool until easy to handle. Discard skin
  and bones.  Cut chicken meat into 1-inch pieces (4 to 5 cups). Strain stock
  into large saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Add carrots, pearl onions, and
  celery.  Cook, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes, until vegetables are just
  tender.  In 2-cup measuring cup, measure milk; whisk in flour, poultry
  seasoning, salt, and pepper until smooth.  Stir into vegetable-stock
  mixture; bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat; boil 1 minute.
  Add cut-up chicken; mix well.  Divide mixture among six 1 1/3-cup
  casseroles or seperate baking dishes.  Preheat oven to 400F.
  
  Remove pastry from refrigerator.  On lightly floured surface, cut pastry
  into 6 equal pieces.  Flatten and evenly roll each piece to a circle the
  same diameter as the top of a casserole.  Cut a cross, 1 1/2 inch across,
  in the center of each.  Lightly moisten edges of casseroles with pastry
  brush and water.  Place pastry circles on top of each casserole. Use knife
  tip to turn back the four corners in center of pastry, exposing filling.
  Firmly press edge of pastry to casserole with table fork. Place casseroles
  on large baking tray or rimmed cookie sheet. Bake for 30 minutes or until
  filling is bubbly.  Remove from oven. Brush crusts with egg yolk mixture.
  Return to oven; bake for 5 minutes longer, or until pastry is golden-brown.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: Brisket of Beef
 Categories: Casseroles, Beef
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 lb Brisket                             2 c  Water
      1 c  Stewed tomatoes                     6    Ginger snap cookies.
      1    Onion soup mix                           Salt & pepper; to taste
 
  Walt:  I have a great recipe for brisket of beef.  It is easy, makes its'
  own great gravy and tastes even better as leftovers. This can be cooked
  either in slow cooker or the oven. Either way, put in the brisket, mix the
  onion soup with 2 cups of water and pour it over the meat. Pour the can of
  stewed tomatoes over the brisket. Place the cookies in the liquid, not on
  the meat.  You can break them up to fit. Seal the pan securely with
  aluminum foil. (If in a slow cooker just put on the lid.) Bake at 325 for
  three hours without peeking !! Take out the meat, and slice it thinly
  against the grain and return it to the pan with the gravy. Reseal and bake
  at 225 for about one hour. Make sure all the meat slices are covered by the
  liquid so the meat does not dry out. This is tender and delicious. The
  gravy is great over rice or wide noodles. FROM: BARBARA ZEGER (BNTH32A)

  "That's the official recipe but here's what I do. Since I'm so lazy I just
  buy the boneless skinned chicken breasts and poach them in the microwave. I
  don't use margarine, I use butter. It calls for 2 cups of broth but I just
  use one 14 1/2 oz can - works fine. And I don't put mine in a 13x9 pan - do
  you have any corning ware stuff? It fits real nice in their oval casserole
  ~ 2 quart I think." (Notes above by Chris)

      Title: Italian Braised Lamb & Potatoes
 Categories: Italian, Casseroles, Beef, Lamb
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      5 tb Olive oil                           3    Garlic cloves crushed
      1 kg Lamb, lean boneless from the        1    Capsicum red, cut into strip
           - shoulder cut into 4cm pcs       250 ml Lamb or beef stock
      2    Brown onions                      500 g  Potatoes, peeled & cut into
    1/2 bn Italian parsley, leaves only             - 4cm pieces
           -chopped                           60 g  Pecorino, grated
 
  The potatoes should be yellow, waxy ones, such as Petrones or Desirees.
  
  Heat half the oil in a large heavy pot.  Brown lamb well in batches and,
  using a slotted spoon, remove to a plate.   Add remaining oil.   Add onion
  and cook until softened.   Add parsley, garlic and capsicum.   Return lamb
  to pot, stir and add stock and freshly ground pepper to taste.   (Don't add
  salt yet as pecorino is a salty cheese)    Reduce heat, cover, and simmer
  for 30 minutes.
  
  Add potato and simmer for another 20 minutes, or until lamb is almost
  tender.   Stir in cheese and cook for 10 minutes. Season with freshly
  ground pepper and salt to taste.
  
  Best if cooked 1 - 2 days ahead and refrigerated.   Like all casseroles, it
  will improve in flavour during the resting period.   Great for
  entertaining, because it can be cooked well in advance, leaving you free to
  get on with the many chores involved in throwing a party.

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 20 servings
 
      1 x  -Dottie Cross TMPJ72B             1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 x  -DOUGH:                             1 x  -FILLING:
      8 tb Unsalted butter; softened         2/3 c  Apple butter
  1 1/4 c  Sugar                               1 tb Lemon juice
      1 ea Large egg                           1 x  Grated zest of 1 lemon
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract                   1/4 c  Finely chopped walnuts
  2 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour            1 x  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 ts Salt                                1 x  -for dusting
 
  To make the dough: In a medium bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set
  at high speed, beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar
  and beat until light in color and texture, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg
  and vanilla. Sift the flour with the salt and baking soda. Gradually add
  the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating well after each addition.
  Scrape the dough onto a large piece of plastic wrap and wrap tightly.
  Refrigerate until the dough is firm enough to roll out, at least 6 hours,
  or preferably overnight. To make the filling: Combine the apple butter,
  lemon juice, lemon zest, and walnuts and mix well. Preheat the oven to 375
  degrees. Divide the dough into 4 portions. On a lightly floured work
  surface, roll out one portion of dough to 1/8 inch thickness. (If the dough
  crumbles, work in your hands until malleable.) Using a 3-inch round cookie
  cutter, cut out rounds of the dough. Gather up the scraps to work into the
  remaining dough. Repeat the process until all the dough has been used.
  Place a rounded teaspoon of the filling in the center of half of the
  rounds. Brush the edges of the rounds lightly with water. Place the
  remaining rounds on top of the filled cookies. Using a fork, press the
  edges sealed. Don't worry if cracks appear in the surface. Transfer the
  cookies to ungreased baking sheets. Bake until lightly browned, 12 to 15
  minutes. Transfer to wire racks and cool completely. Sprinkle with
  confectioners' sugar before serving.  Makes about 20 large cookies. Source:

      Title: Cinnamon Crisps
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      1 x  -Dottie Cross TMPJ72B           1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      8 tb Unsalted butter; softened           1 ts Baking powder
    1/3 c  Sugar                               1 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 tb Sugar                             1/8 ts Salt
      1 ea Large egg yolk                     24 ea Walnut halves
    1/2 ts Vanilla                        
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter 2 baking sheets. In a medium bowl,
  using a hand-held electric mixer set at high speed, beat the butter until
  creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and continue beating until the
  mixture is light in color and texture, about 2 additional minutes. Beat in
  the yolk and vanilla. Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt
  onto a sheet of waxed paper. Using a wooden spoon, work the dry ingredients
  into the creamed mixture to form a stiff dough. Scrape the dough onto
  another piece of waxed paper and form into a thick log about 8 inches long.
  Wrap the log in the waxed paper and refrigerate until chilled and firm,
  about 1 hour. Using a sharp knife, cut the chilled dough into 24 slices,
  each about 5/6 inch thick. Arrange the slices about 2 inches apart on the
  prepared baking sheets. Flatten the slices slightly with a fork, and top
  each with a walnut half. Bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let
  cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer to wire cake racks
  to cool completely. The cookies will keep, stored in an airtight container
  at room temperature, for 3 days. Makes 24 cookies. Source: "An Edible
  Christmas" (A Treasury of Recipes for the Holiday) by Irena Chalmers.

  You are going to cut, bread and fry the eggplant first.
  
  Peel the dark skin off the eggplant. Slice into medium slices slices (about
  1/2 in thick) on the smaller side. Pour Flavored Bread crumbs into a plate
  or into a dish for coating the eggplant patties. . Beat 3 eggs for dipping
  into eggplant. Heat up oil in a large pan, enough to fry the eggplant. Dip
  eggplant into egg and coat it with egg thoroughly. Then coat it with bread
  crumbs. Put them on to a plate when finished till you have enough to fry in
  your frying pan. Place the eggplant in the frying pan if you think it is
  hot enough to fry properly. Keep it frying till both sides are brown. Make
  sure you flip eggplant over so all sides will brown. When finished frying a
  batch place fried patties onto a plate covered with a paper towel to absorb
  the oil. Pre heat the oven to 350~.
  
  After all the frying is done. Coat a pan with some oil (about a 9in square
  by 1 1/2 in deep disposable aluminum pan). Pour a little bit tomato sauce
  on the bottom of the pan. Place a layer of the eggplant patties on top.
  Cover that with sauce and a little bit of mozzerella cheese. Place another
  layer on top of that, repeat. When done put sauce and a lot of cheese at
  the very top add parmesian cheese to the top if desired or available.
  
  Cover the top of pan with foil. Place in the oven for 45 minutes. Stick
  fork in middle to see if it is hot all the way through. If not hot enough
  cook another 10 minutes. Leave it cooking with the foil off the top for the
  last 10 minutes of the cooking.
  
  Let it settle before serving for about 5 minutes. This taste good or better
  reheated. Can be reheated in Microwaveable dish. Enjoy any questions or
  errors let me know.

    1/2 c  Bourbon                             1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 c  Butter; softened                         Salt
  1 1/2 c  Sugar                               1 ts Lemon zest; grated
      5    Eggs                                1 tb Lemon juice
      4 c  Flour; sifted                       1 c  Pecans; chopped
 
  Marinate raisins in 1 cup of the bourbon for at least 1 hour, up to 12
  hours; drain, reserving both raisins and bourbon. Preheat oven to 350~F.
  Butter and flour a 10-inch Bundt cake pan or other tube-cake pan. Beat
  together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. (For best results,
  use an electric mixer and start beating at a slow speed, gradually
  increasing to moderate. If you allow this process to take about 15 minutes,
  the butter will be very pale and look something like whipped cream. This
  adds lightness to the cake.) Beat in the eggs 1 at a time, beating well
  after each. In another bowl, sift together 3 3/4 cups of the flour, baking
  powder, soda and salt. Combine reserved bourbon with the zest and lemon
  juice. Add dry ingredients to the butter mixture alternatelywith the
  bourbon mixture. Toss the remaining 1/4 cup of flour with the drained
  raisins and the pecans. Fold into batter. Bake about 11/2 hours or until
  the cake tests done. Cool about 10 minutes in the pan before turninout onto
  a rack. Brush the remaining 1/2 cup of bourbon over the cake whileit is
  still somewhat warm. For long storage, wrap the cake in rinsed cheesecloth
  that has been thoroughly moistened in bourbon. Then wrap in plastic ofoil
  so that it is airtight. The cake may be served after a day or two but is
  better if allowed to age.

      Title: Applesauce Cake in Jars
 Categories: Fruits, Cakes, Sauces
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  ELLIE COLLIN CMKD93F              1/2 ts BAKING POWDER
    2/3 c  SHORTENING                          2 ts BAKING SODA
  2 2/3 c  GRANULATED SUGAR                1 1/2 ts SALT
      4 ea Large EGGS                          1 ts GROUND CINNAMON
      2 c  APPLESAUCE                          2 ts GROUND CLOVES
    2/3 c  WATER                             2/3 c  NUTS; chopped,optional
  3 1/3 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, sifted      
 
  Sterilize 8 (12 oz Ball Quilted Crystal - #14400-81400) canning jars, lids
  and rings by boiling for 10 minutes. Remove the jars and allow to air-dry
  and cool. Leave the  lids and rings in the hot water until ready to use.
  Once the jars are cool enough to handle, grease them (use a pastry brush)
  with shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret); set aside. Cream
  together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until
  the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and water; set aside.
  In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
  cinnamon and cloves. Blend dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture.
  Fold in the nuts.  Pour batter into the jars, filling them about 1/2 full.
  Place jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll fall over. Bake in a preheated
  325-degree oven for 35-40 minutes or  until a pick inserted deep into the
  center of each cake  comes out clean. Remove jars from the oven,
  one-at-a-time (use HEAVY-DUTY MITTS, the jars ARE HOT!); place a lid, then
  a ring on  top and screw down tightly.
   Place jars onto your counter top to cool. You'll know when the jars have
  sealed, you'll hear a "plinking" sound. If you missed the sound, test them
  by pressing down on the lids once the jars have cooled--they shouldn't move
  at  all.
   Store jars in a cool, dry place. They should keep for about a year. I've
  only been able to keep them for a few weeks, they don't last that long
  around here. They're wonderful for last minute gifts, especially for single
  friends.

      Title: Pumpkin Spice Cake in Jars
 Categories: Fruits, Cakes
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  ELLIE COLLIN   (CMKD93F)            2 ts GROUND CLOVES
      1 c  SEEDLESS RAISINS                    2 ts GROUND CINNAMON
      1 c  WALNUTS                             1 ts GROUND GINGER
      2 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR                   4 ea EGGS
      2 ts BAKING SODA                         2 c  GRANULATED SUGAR
    1/4 ts BAKING POWDER                       1 c  SALAD OIL
    1/2 ts SALT                               16 oz Canned PUMPKIN
 
  Preheat oven to 325-degrees.
   Sterilize 8 (1 pint, straight-sided) Kerr or Ball Quilted Crystal (12 oz,
  straight-sided, Ball #14400-81400) canning jars, lids and rings by in
  boiling water for 10 minutes.  Remove the jars from the water and allow to
  air-dry. Leave  the lids and rings in the hot water until ready to use.
  Once cool, brush (use a pastry brush) the inside of jars with shortening
  (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret); set aside. Coarsely chop the nuts and
  raisins; set aside.
   Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt cloves, cinnamon
  and ginger in a large bowl. Add raisins and walnuts; toss lightly to
  combine.
   In another large bowl, beat eggs at high speed until thick and yellow (2-3
  minutes). Gradually beat in the sugar until thick and light. At low speed,
  beat in the oil and pumpkin; blend thoroughly. Gradually stir in the flour
  mixture until  well blended.
   Divide batter among the 8 canning jars (should be slightly less than 1/2
  full). Wipe the  sides of the jar off (inside/outside) in case you slop or
  it'll burn. Place jars on a cookie sheet or they'll tip over. Bake in
  preheated 325-degree oven for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted
  deep into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
   When cakes test done, remove the jars, one-by-one, place a lid, then a
  ring onto each jar, screw down tightly. USE HEAVY-DUTY MITTS! The jars are
  H O T ! Place jars onto your counter to cool. You'll be able to tell if
  they've sealed--you'll hear a "plinking" sound. If you miss the sound, test
  each jar by pushing on the lids once the jars are cool, they shouldn't move
  at all.  These will keep in a cool, dark place for about 1 year. I'm not
  sure, they don't last that long around here!

      Title: Brownie Cakes in a Jar
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  ELLIE COLLIN   (CMKD93F)          1/4 c  WATER
      2 ea CANNING JARS, wide mouth            3 tb UNSWEETENED COCOA POWDER
      1 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR                 1/4 c  BUTTERMILK
      1 c  SUGAR                               1 ea EGG; beaten
    1/2 ts BAKING SODA                       1/2 ts VANILLA EXTRACT
    1/4 ts GROUND CINNAMON (optional)        1/4 c  WALNUTS; finely chopped
    1/3 c  BUTTER;or MARGARINE            
 
  Here's one you can start out with, it makes 2 jars. Every recipe technique
  is the same, just different ingredients.. Sterilize, two 1-pint
  straight-sided wide-mouth canning jars (specifically made for canning jams
  and jellies) lids and rings by boiling for 10 minutes (keep the lids and
  rings in the hot water until ready to use); set aside. In a small bowl stir
  together flour, sugar, baking soda and cinnamon, if desired. Set aside. In
  a medium saucepan combine butter or margarine, water and cocoa powder; heat
  and stir until butter or margarine is melted and mixture is well blended.
  Remove from heat; stir in flour mixture. Add buttermilk, egg and vanilla;
  beat by hand until smooth. Stir in nuts. Pour mixture into the prepared
  canning jars; place jars onto a cookie sheet. Preheat oven to 325-degrees.
  Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a pick inserted deep into each cake comes
  out clean. Remove cakes from the oven, one at a time. Place a lid, then a
  ring onto the jars and screw down tightly. USE HEAVY-DUTY MITTS, the jars
  ARE HOT!! Place jars onto your counter to cool. You'll hear a "plinking"
  sound. If you miss the sound, wait until the cakes are cool and press on
  the lids, they shouldn't move at all, that means they've sealed. Store
  cakes in a cool, dark place. They should last up to a year--I don't know,
  they've never lasted that long around here! If you'd like to decorate them,
  place a wad of cotton in the center of each lid, then place a piece of
  decorative cloth, about 3-inches larger in circumference than the lid, (cut
  with pinking shears) on top of the cotton. Screw the ring back on (by this
  time the rings can be removed as the lids should be sealed). Use your
  imagination when decorating--a hot glue gun works wonders (dried flowers,
  ribbon, etc). These make WONDERFUL Christmas gifts. Ellie

      Title: Gingerbread Baked in Jars
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  ELLIE COLLIN CMKD93F                2 ts GROUND GINGER
  2 1/4 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR                   1 ts GROUND CINNAMON
    3/4 c  SUGAR                             1/2 ts GROUND CLOVES
      1 ts BAKING SODA                         1 c  MARGARINE; softened
    1/2 ts BAKING POWDER                     3/4 c  WATER;hot
    1/4 ts SALT                              1/2 c  MOLASSES
 
  Preheat oven to 350-degrees (pan method) or 325-degrees for jars.
   Grease (use shortening) a 9 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan or 5 (12 oz) Kerr
  Quilted Crystal Jelly Jars (#14400-80400)-- they MUST have straight sides,
  no buldges in the jars. Also, the jars will have to be sterlized
  first--boil them  for 10 minutes, leave the lids and rings in the water
  until  you're ready to use them; remove the jars and allow them to air-dry
  and cool before greasing. Use a pastry brush to grease the jars. DO NOT use
  Pam or Baker's Secret!  In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking
  powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Stir in margarine,
  water and molasses until well blended.
   Pour into prepared pan or divide equally among the 5 jars. Place jars onto
  a cookie sheet or they'll tip over. PAN METHOD-- Bake in preheated
  350-degree oven for 40-50 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center
  comes out  clean. Cool slightly on wire rack.
   JAR METHOD--Bake in a preheated 325-degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes or
  until cake tester inserted deep into the center of each jar comes out
  clean.
   Have your lids ready (HOT). Take one jar at a time from the oven (using
  heavy-duty mitts--the jars ARE HOT!) and place a lid on, then the ring.
  Tightly screw on lids. Allow to cool on your counter top. You'll know when
  the jars have  sealed, you'll hear a "plinking" sound. If you don't hear
  the sound wait until the jars have cooled, then press down on the jar lids,
  they shouldn't move at all.  If you'd like to decorate the jars, wait until
  they've  cooled completely. Remove the ring (the lids should have sealed by
  now) and place a wad of cotton in the center of each lid; place a piece of
  decorative cloth (about 3 inches larger in circumference than the jar lid,
  cut with pinking  shears) over the cotton. Screw the ring back on. If you'd
  like to decorate further, use your hot glue gun, it's wonderful to glue on
  dried flowers, ribbons--use your  imagination! If you like spicey and moist
  gingerbread,  you'll love this one.

      Title: Canned Cake Hints
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  ELLIE COLLIN CMKD93F           
 
  I have a few more recipes but no time to upload them right now, I'll do
  that later on this evening. BTW, ANY cake can be baked in canning jars. I
  usually try one jar first--you have to know how much volume each recipe
  will give you. I usually fill ONE jar 1/2 full then bake it to see how high
  it rises. You don't want the cake to come out of the top of the jar, only
  to within 1/4 to 1/2 inch from the lip of the jar. Once you've established
  how high the cake rises, you can go from there. The first time around is a
  bit tricky because you won't know how many jars you'll need. MOST of the
  recipes I've tried I end up using around 8. Sterilize as many jars as you
  think you'll need and go from there. Also, the baking times will vary--the
  moistness of each cake recipe will determine the time. Again, MOST of the
  recipes I've tried bake in 35-40 minutes. Start checking the cakes at 30
  minutes and go from there. YES, the cakes DO slide easily out of the jars
  IF you use the jars I listed. They're Ball Quilted Crystal Canning Jars
  (#14400-81400). They can be found at most grocery stores (at least here in
  California) next to the pectin and other canning supplies. Also, I've seen
  the 12 oz straight-sided (plain) jars (# ?) at Smart & Final. The plain
  jars work fine too but they're not as pretty and you have to make your own
  labels--the jars I use come with decorative labels. One IMPORTANT tip--get
  your jars NOW! Once summer's over with they're very hard to find. Also,
  when you can, ask for the jars back, they're NOT cheap. Most folks don't
  mind returning them though, they usually want refills! <G> Make sure your
  LIDS are new, the rings don't have to be As the jars do seal, the cakes are
  as moist as the day you put them into the jars--sometimes MORESO. There
  will be a little condensation on the lids and some in the jars so when you
  seal them it's trapped inside. Don't worry about getting the water off of
  the lids before placing them onto the jars, the added moisture doesn't hurt
  the cakes in the slightest. I'm trying to address every question that's
  been asked of me before, I HOPE I've done that. If I've missed anything or
  if anyone has any questions, don't hesitate to ask. These make WONDERFUL
  Christmas gifts and you can start NOW! Single friends really appreciate
  these because each jar makes enough for one or two people.

  FRIENDSHIP POEM:  "A penny for happy thoughts, Grains that grow and
  nourish, Leavenings to lift us up, May friendship ever flourish."These
  lovely friendship loaves were inspired by the "Begger's Rhyme" of unknown
  origin..."Christmas is coming, the geese are getting fat, plase put a penny
  in the old man's hat, If you haven't got a penny, a ha'penny will do, If
  you haven't got a ha'penny--God Bless You!" This special message to
  accompany your gift breads (the Friendship Poem), is sure to spread the
  feeling of warm frienship and good will.I have never tried this recipe. It

      1 x  -finely chopped                
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 10-inch tube pan with a
  nonremovable bottom. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking
  powder, baking soda, and salt. In a medium pot, combine the sugar and water
  and bring them to a boil. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the
  chocolate and 1 stick of butter. When the chocolate and butter have
  completely melted, whisk the mixture to combine completely. Whisk in the
  beaten eggs. Pour about half the chocolate mixture into the dry ingredients
  and whisk vigorously to thoroughly combine the ingredients and remove any
  lumps. Working quickly, add the remaining chocolate mixture and whisk to
  combine. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 60
  minutes, until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let
  the cake cool in the pan for about 15 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to
  cool completely. In a medium bowl, cream together the remaining 3 sticks of
  butter and the confectioners' sugar, until light and fluffy. Remove 1/3 cup
  of the icing, place in a small bowl, and color it with a few drops of the
  green food coloring. Put the remaining icing in a pot, add the vanilla.
  Over low heat, stir the icing until it becomes a pourable consistency. (If
  it overheats, causing the butter to spearate, put the icing in the
  refrigerator to chill and stir to bring it back together.) Pour the icing
  over the cooled cake so that it drips down the center and outside. Cluster
  the red berries in groups of 3 on top of the cake. Fill the green icing
  into a pastry bag fitted with a leaf tip and pipe a few leaves around each
  cluster of berries. Serves 12 to 16. Source:"An Edible Christmas" (A

      2 c  Crunchy peanut butter (gener        1 c  Confectioners sugar
           -ic works fine)                   1/4 c  Butter (at room temperature)
 
  Mix well, roll into small balls and dip in mixture of 6 oz chocolate chips
  (melted) and 1/4 stick of parafin.  let stand on rack for chocolate to drip
  off and firm up. Alternatively, and lots quicker, pat peanut butter mixture
  into a buttered pan, and top with melted chocolate chips, mark into SMALL
  squares before chocolate gets totally firm.  After standing overnight cut.
  These taste just   like the Reese's cups, and keep well in an airtight
  cannister.

------------------------STIR TOGETHER BEFORE HEATING------------------------
      2 c  Cane sugar                          1 ts Oil flavor* & color
    2/3 c  Light Karo                          1 ts Or more citric acid**
    3/4 c  Water                          
 
  Have color/flavor/citric acid ready when finished cooking! *More or less,
  some flavors are stronger than others. **Put citric acid in fruit-flavored
  candies for tartness. TEST YOUR THERMOMETER EVERY DAY! To test: Place it in
  cold water & bring to boil. If water boils at- say 210 instead of 212,
  reduce cooking time 2 degrees. ***I use a TAYLOR thermometer. Wilton sells
  them now. Spray *PAM in molds & on surface. Not too much & only once per
  session. USE A THIN PAN, NOT HEAVY! Candy must set a few minutes in the pan
  & the temp will rise, burning the candy in a thick pan. Bring mixture to
  boil. Put lid on for 3 minutes <to wash down sugar crystals>, add
  thermometer & DON'T STIR. When therm. reaches 285-290D. remove pot from
  stove.Wait for temp. to lower below 260^ before adding color/flavor/citric
  acid. <Will cook flavor out if too hot.> Cover pan after adding citric acid
  so it won't fade the taste. I add about 2 ts citric acid.
        DON'T STIR!  Use the tiny viles of Lorann oils. Avail. in cake supply
  shop or drug store.
   I pour the cooked candy into a GUTTMAN candy funnel <holds entire recipe.>
  Thats the quickest way to get it in molds befor it cools & hardens. *Of
  course, spray funnel! I pour some into molds & the rest onto my marble
  slab. The part on the slab: I roll it into a long cylinder & cut into
  "pillows" w/scissors. Dust finished candies with powdered sugar so they
  won't "melt" together. There is one very nice sucker mold. It is a white
  ring w/ a slit for the stick. <Don't spray stick.> All you do is spray
  mold, add stick, fill w/candy, cool & remove easily Comes in 2-3 sizes,
  round or heart-shaped. I beleive it is Guttman Brand & available here at
  Sugarcraft. About 2 dz in a pack. This is my kids favorite Christmas candy.
  You will want to make several flavors. Experiment on how-much flavor. All
  vary. *Don't add too much on the mints. Takes more on the
  cherry/strawberry/lemon/orange, etc. There are at least 50 oil flavors
  available to choose from! Shared by Dolores McCann, Hamilton OH

      Title: Smashed Radishes in Soy Dressing

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Dozen fresh red radishes            3 tb Peanut oil
      2 ts Salt                                1 ts Sesame oil

  Remove heads and tails from radishes; wash.  Using bottom of heavy drinking
  glass, about 2" across base, hit radishes on side to crack them - not mash
  them - so dressing can get into flesh.  Avoid rendering a crushing blow no
  matter how you feel that day.  Sprinkle radishes all over with salt, put
  them in a bowl, and set aside for about 15 minutes at room temperature.
  
  Prepare dressing:  Combine vinegar, sugar, thin soy sauce, peanut oil,
  sesame oil and fresh ginger juice.  Double amount of vinegar for a sharper
  taste, if desired.  Drain liquid from radishes (salt will have drawn off
  quite a bit of water); pour dressing over them; cover and refrigerate for
  30 minutes. If you make this dish ahead of time, pour on dressing 30
  minutes before serving. Immediately before serving, transfer radishes to

           Broken into small pieces      

------------------------------CHOCOLATE TILES------------------------------
      8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate                     Confectioners sugar
           Cocoa powder, unsweetened      
 
  Souffle Cake.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter jelly roll pan of
  approximately 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1 inches; line pan with wax paper; allow
  wax paper to extend over each end by about 2 inches. Set aside. Melt
  chocolate with coffee in 200 degree oven, for about 10 minutes, or until
  melted.	Cool.
  
  Beat egg yolks with electric mixer until smooth.  Gradually add sugar and
  continue beating until mixture is pale yellow, about 5 minutes.  Stir in
  the cooled chocolate mixture.
  
  Beat egg whites with salt until they form stiff peaks. Stir 1/5 egg whites
  into chocolate mixture to lighten and then pour chocolate mixture into egg
  whites.  Gently fold whites and chocolate together until no white shows.
  Pour batter into prepared jelly roll pan. Bake for 14 minutes.
  
  Truffle Cream. Place chocolate in bowl, and place in 200 degree oven for 15
  minutes or until melted.  Heat heavy cream in saucepan until hot.  Slowly
  pour hot cream over melted chocolate, and stir until smooth and shiny.
  Strain mixture into bowl and cool to room temperature.
  
  Tiles. Place chocolate in bowl and place in 200 degree oven for 15 minutes
  or until melted. Place wax paper down the length of a 17 x 14-inch baking
  pan. Secure end with dab of softened butter. Pour melted chocolate on wax
  paper, and with a metal spatula spread it out the length of the baking pan.
  
  Refrigerate chocolate for 1 hour.  Remove chocolate and leave it at room
  temperature for 5 minutes.  Cut chocolate into three strips, one 3 1/4
  inches wide, and two strips 2 1/2 inches wide. Cut strips crosswise into
  3/4-inch sections to make tiles. Refrigerate until needed.
  
  Continued from Chocolate Tile Cake - Part I.  It may be long, but it's
  worth the effort.
  
  Refrigerate Truffle Cream, mixing bowl and beaters for 1 hour.	Over the top
  of the Souffle Cake, sift unsweetened cocoa. Cover the cake (leave in pan)
  with a sheet of wax paper and cookie sheet. Invert cake onto them. Remove
  jelly roll pan and wax paper. Slip out cookie sheet. Trim rough edges of
  cake. Divide cake lengthwise into 3 equal strips about 3 1/4 inches each.
  
  Remove the Truffle Cream, mixing bowl and beaters from refrigerator. Place
  2 1/3 cups cream in mixing bowl.	Return remainder to refrigerator. Beat
  about 1 1/2 minutes. Place one strip of cake on cookie sheet.	Spread 1/2 of
  beaten cream on cake, top cream with second cake strip. Place remainder
  beaten cream over top and cover with last cake strip. Trim any rough edges
  and chill cake for 1/2 hour. Chill clean mixing bowl and beaters.
  
  Beat remaining Truffle Cream in chilled bowl for 1 1/2 minutes.  Remove
  cake from refrigerator and spread cream over top and sides.
  
  Remove tiles from refrigerator.  Trim the tiles to fit height of
  cake.	Using sharp knife, separate 3 strips of tile. Place the 3 1/4-inch
  tile over top of cake. Leave wax paper on. Place the two remaining strips
  along sides of cake. Try to align side and top tiles. Cover cake tightly
  with aluminum foil and refrigerate over night.
  
  Remove cake from refrigerator. Remove foil.  Trim off ends of cake.  Place
  cake on serving dish.  Peel off strips of wax paper.  Place narrow strips
  of foil diagonally on top of cake to form pattern, and sift confectioners
  sugar over it. Lift off foil. Serve with Creme de Menthe Custard Sauce.

      1 ts Ginger                         
 
  The following may be part of dipping vegatables, and the paragraph was
  misplaced.  * Cabbage should be shredded. Saute the pork, onion, and
  cabbage in hot oil until lightly browned. Stir in the mushrooms, bean
  sprouts, currants, and almonds and saute, stirring for 1 minute. Dissolve
  the cornstarch in 2 T water, and combine with sherry, soy sauce, and
  ginger; add to the pork mixture and bring to a boil, stirring. Remove from
  heat and cool.  Stack the egg roll wrappers and cut in half to form
  rectangles.  Forming one roll at a time, place a heaping teaspoonful of
  pork mixture on one end of rectangle, moisten the long edges, and roll up.
  Press the edges together to seal.  Egg roll may be prepared to this point,
  then refrigerated for several hours or overnight or frozen for several days
  before frying.  Adjust time for browining. If rolls are frozen, let them
  thaw before cooking.  Heat the oil to 375 degrees F. and fry the egg rolls,
  4 or 5 at a time, until golden brown and crisp on all sides. Frying will
  take about 4 to 5 minutes; turn rolls once. Drain on paper towels and keep
  warm while frying the remaining rolls. Serve with warm Ginger Apricot
  Sauce. GINGER APRICOT SAUCE: Combine the apricots, sugar, ginger, and salt
  with 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
  simmer, uncov- ered, for 5 minutes. Pour the mixture into a blender
  container or food processor. Add lemon juice, cover and process until
  smooth. Serve warm.

      Title: Anchor Bar Hot Wings
 Categories: Appetizers, Poultry
      Yield: 12 servings
 
           Chicken wings                            Read below
 
  The following was originally posted by G.SCHAEFFER GBGM64A. The key to good
  Buffalo Wings is how you prepare them as well as the ingredients and the
  handling of the wings.  The most successful wings served up here in Buffalo
  are what they call "Grade A Grinders." Fresh wings that are very large and
  meaty. Usually, you cannot get them in a frozen package, but can get them
  from a poultry dealer.  Once you find them make sure they are absolutely
  fresh.  Wash them in cold water, split them at the joint and remove the
  tips. Place them on a rack on a pan and refrigerate overnight to let the
  blood and water drain out of the wings. THIS IS A REAL KEY. Drying the
  wings under refrigeration will help to make them a much crispier product,
  once deep fried. Next, use a deep fryer or a very heavy deep pot with a
  thermometer and add the oil.  Peanut oil is very good, or a commercial
  product such as can be found at a restaurant cash and carry called Mel Fry.
  Heat the oil up SLOWLY, to 365F, and depending on the size of the fryer,
  deep fry the dry wings 6-8 minutes in small batches, until thoroughly done
  and golden brown. Hold the cooked wings in a warm oven if necessary. A
  combination of melted margarine and hot sauce in the ratio of 1 part
  margarine to 3 parts hot sauce will add the right zing. The key here is to
  add just enough sauce to coat the wings - the more sauce you add, the
  hotter they will be.  For the very brave, 1 part margarine to 3 parts hot
  sauce and 1 part Tabasco is referred to as "Suicidal Wings" by the late and
  dear Don Bellissimo, who owned the Anchor Bar. Working quickly, place the
  deep fried wings in a large bowl and add the sauce mixture, shaking to coat
  them. There are many good hot sauces to use; the one they use is either
  Durkee Franks Red Hot Sauce or Wingers Original, again found in a
  restaurant cash and carry. Celery sticks and chunky blue cheese dressing
  (Ken's Buffalo Style Blue Cheese is a popular one) and plenty of napkins.

    1/2 c  MARGARINE.                          1 ts SODA.

  Try mixing Vanilla and egg  beat until mixed. Add the Buttermilk and the
  Soda; (I have used 7up) and sift the dry ingredients into this. add the
  rest of the ingredients, mix well. Put the container into the refrigerator
  chill over night. Take out and roll small pieces of the dough into long
  strips, then form them into a figure eight,(like a pretzel) put them back
  into the Refrigerator for about an hour, when they have raised to
  approximately what looks to be the right hight. Bake in a 450 deg
  pre-heated oven for approximately 6 to 8 minutes, ( May vary with the
  weather so keep an eye on them).But they should be a light brown before you
  remove them. Refrigeration is one of the keys of "KRINGLA" making. They
  must be refrigerated in order for them to get the flavor, you could bake
  them without refrigeration but you lose a lot of the flavor. You can also
  use.

      Title: Buttercream
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3    Egg yolks                           1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 tb Sugar                               1 c  Unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Whipping cream                           - at room temperature
    1/2 c  Milk                              1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
 
  WHISK YOLKS AND SUGAR TOGETHER in a mixing bowl until smooth. Combine
  cream, milk and vanilla in a pot, place over high heat. As soon as mixture
  boils, remove from heat and slowly pour over the yolks, stirring. Replace
  mixture in a pot, place over low heat and cook, stirring constantly with a
  wooden spoon. When the mixture has a consistency that coats the spoon,
  remove from the heat and pour into a bowl. Continue to stir as the mixture
  cools. Be very careful not to overcook or the yolks will curdle. Cool to
  room temperature. Place the butter and confectioners' sugar in a mixer and
  cream together. Slowly add the cooled cream mixture until you have achieved
  a light, creamy frosting consistency.

           -softened                           1 c  Sour cream

  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 10-to 12-cup fluted tube
  pan. In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at high speed,
  beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and continue
  beating at high speed until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Sift
  together the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. At low speed,
  beat in 1/2 cup of the flour mixture, then beat in 1 of the eggs. Beat in
  another 1/2 cup of the flour mixture, then 1 of the remaining eggs. Repeat
  with another 1/2 cup of the flour mixture, and the last egg. Beat in the
  remaining flour along with the sour cream and vanilla. Using a spatula,
  fold in the walnuts and chocolate. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan
  and smooth the surface. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes in the preheated oven
  until the cake begins to shrink from the sides of the pan and a toothpick
  inserted in the center comes out clean. The surface will crack. Remove the
  cake from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes in the pan, then turn
  it out onto a wire cake rack. Cool completely before serving. Serves 12.

  stir into dry mixture.  Mix in 1 egg and enough remaining flourto make soft
  dough.  On lightly floured surface, knead until smooth and elastic, about 4
  to 6 minutes.  Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.
  
  On floured surface, roll dough to 16X9-inch rectangle.  Spread with
  Cranberry Orange Nut Filling to within 1/2-inch of dough edges.  Roll up
  from long edge as for jelly roll; pinch seam to seal.  Place, seam-side
  down, on baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray.  Form into a ring and
  pinch ends to seal.  With sharp knife, cut slits starting from outer edge,
  2/3 of the way through dogh at 1-inch intervals.  Turn each section on its
  side to show filling.  Spray dough with cooking spray.  cover; let rise in
  warm draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30to45 minutes.
  
  Beat remaining egg; brush on dough.  Bake at 375 degrees for 25-35 minutes
  or until done.  Tent with foil during last 10 minutes of baking to prevent
  over browning.  remove from sheet; coon on wire rack.  Drizzle with
  confectioners sugar glaze.
  
  **Cranberry Orange Nut Filling:  In medium saucepan, heat cranberries,
  orange segments and honey to a boil.  Reduce heat; simmer for 5 to 10
  minutes, stirring occasionally, or until thickened.  Stir in Bran and
  Pecans,.  cool completely.
  
  **Glaze:  Beat sugar, milk and extract until smooth.  (Start with 4
  teaspoons milk and add as needed).

           NFXS18B                           1/2 tb Salt
      1 tb Dry yeast                           2 tb Cider vinegar
  1 1/2 c  Warm water                      5 1/2 c  White flour
      1 c  Sourdough starter                 1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 tb Sugar                                    Yellow cornmeal
 
  In lg warmed bowl, sprinkle yeast over water, stir to dissolve and let
  stand until bubbly. Blend in starter, sugar, salt and vinegar. Gradually
  beat in 3 c of the flour. Beat at least 3 mins. Turn batter into a lg oiled
  glass or ceramic bowl, cover with towel and let rise in warm place 1 hr or
  until double in bulk. Combine 1 c of the remaining flour with baking soda.
  Stir batter down and add flour-baking soda mixture. Gradually add remaining
  flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto floured board and knead, adding
  additional flour only as needed to prevent sticking, approx 300 strokes of
  folding and turnin or until dough is smooth and elastic. Sprinkle a greased
  baking sheet with cornmeal. Form dough into 2 oblong loaves and place on
  sheet. Cover with towel and let rise in warm place 1 to 1-1/2 hr or until
  not quite double in size. With sharp razor, slash the tops of loaves
  diagonally. Mist with water and bake in 450 oven 10 mins. Reduce heat to
  400 and bake 35 mins longer or until bread tests done. For a harder crust,
  place a pan of hot water on bottom of oven and mist with water several
  times during baking. Remove pan of water after 15 mins of baking. Turn out
  onto wire rack and cool. NOTE: If you like your sourdough very dar, remove
  the baked bread from the pan or sheet and place under broiler about 2 mins,
  or until rich brown in color.

      Title: Sourest Sourdough
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           -Gaye Levy ** DTXT63A               1 tb Olive oil
           -Revised on 9/17/92                 2 tb Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Sourdough starter                   1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Water                               2 ts Yeast
      3 c  Bread flour                   

------------------------DIANA (:>)51ST STATEBUZZY BU------------------------
 
  Set starter out on counter and bring to room temperature. Feed as you
  normally do and allow to become foamy and active. This will take 8 to 12
  hours.
  
  Put all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle. When the cycle
  is complete, remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a damp towel
  and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes. (This rest period makes the dough
  more pliable.)
  
  Sprinkle corn meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical loaves.
  Place loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet or in a special "baguette
  pan" that can be purchased at a kitchen store. Cover again with the damp
  towel and put in the refer for 12 to 24 hours.
  
  Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with water, and let it sit out until
  the loaves are fully risen. (They will usually rise a little in the refer,
  too.)
  
  Spray again with water then bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown and
  crusty. If you want a really crusty bread, spray the loaf with water every
  five minutes while baking. This harder to describe than it is to do ... and
  the results are worth it!
  
  PLEASE NOTE: Depending on the temperature, humidity, and the whim of the
  starter, the bread will vary from batch to batch. Sometimes it is very sour
  and dense while other times it is mildly sour and fluffy inside. Each batch
  is unique...but it is always good. I found that using the special pan
  helped the baguettes keep their shape. The pan is well worth the fifteen
  bucks.
  
  You can also vary the flavor of the bread by using more or less sugar or by
  substituting 1 TBL of vinegar for 1 TBL of water. Another variation is to
  use flat beer instead of water in either the recipe or when feeding the
  starter.  (Be sure to separate your starter into two batches first so that
  you do not contaminate the orignal pot.)
  
  Everytime I share this recipe, I get notes saying this is the beat
  sourdough ever!

  Make a starter of 1 bottle stale beer with equal parts of flour. Let set as
  usuall until you have a sourdough starter (about 3 days) then mix 1 cup
  starter with 2 cup warm water, 4 T sugar and 2-1/2 cups flour. Beat till
  smooth. Set in gas oven (turn off) and let sit 28 hours. Beat in 3 eggs, 1
  T salt, 1 Cup sour cream, 1/3 cup bacon grease and enough flour to make a
  soft dough. (about 7-8 cups) knead till smooth. Let rise till doubled punch
  down and let rise again. Form into 2 loves. Let rise. Bake 375 about 30
  minutes. IT has taken anywhere from 3 hours to 12 hours to rise so hang in
  there. This was the sourest sourdough I'd ever eaten but it was to die for.

    1/2 c  Honey;or brown sugar                1 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/3 c  Warm water                          1 c  Flour white;or unbleached
 
  Sprinkle ginger and 1 T honey or brown sugar over warm water. Sprinkle
  yeast over this and stir. Let stand in warm place about 10 minutes till
  doubled in size. Mix milk, rest of honey or brown sugar, flours into yeast
  mixture in a glass container about the size of a gallon pyrex jar. Stir,
  using only a wooden spoon, since metal objects will retard herman's growth.
  Leave the cover on lossely or place a glass plate over the top of the
  container. So Herman can breathe. Herman doubles, enen tripples at time of
  vigorous rising. Place Herman in a warm place overnight. Next day
  refridgerate, Lossely covered and stir each day. This is very important
  with wheat and honey starter as more gasses form in the container and are
  released during stirring. Formation of this gas may cause the starter to
  appear darker on the top than on the bottom. But this is okay. On the 5 th
  day measure out 1 cup herman for baking and another to give to a friend if
  you wish. Then feed what herman you have left thusly: FEEDING HERMAN 1/2

      1 c  White flour                    
 
  Cook potato in water to cover until tender. Pour off liquid to measure 1 c,
  saving potato for other use. Let potato water cook to lukewarm. In a glass
  or ceramic bowl that has been scalded, place flour, yeast and sugar; add
  lukewarm potato water and stir in well. Cover with plastic wrap and pierce
  with fork to release gases. Place in a warm, draft-free location at an even
  85F for 2 days; stir several times daily. (do not let sourdough starter
  rise above 95F because higher temp are favorable to less desireable
  microorganisms) Refrigerate until ready to use. Replenish with one c flour
  and 3/4 c water and let stand overnight or 12 hrs in a warm location before
  refrigerating again. When replenishing, add lukewarm water with flour.
  Starter should be at room temp when using in recipes, always after having
  stood 12 hrs from addition of replenishing flour and water. At least 1 c
  should remain to refrigerate.

  you have several starters, keep whole wheat separate from others to
  preserve its own distinctive flavor. Whole wheat starter does not have as
  much rising action as that made with white flour; you may have to plan
  longer rising times. To replenish, always use whole wheat flour.

      1    Glass jar or drinking glass              Food coloring (optional)
      1    Piece of cotton string              1 c  Water
      1    Pencil or stick                     2 c  Sugar
      1    Paper clip                               Additional sugar
 
  Tie a short piece of cotton string to the middle of the pencil or stick.
  Attach a paper clip to the end of the string for a weight. Moisten the
  string very lightly, and roll in a bit of sugar (this will "attract" the
  sugar crystals from the syrup to the string). Place the pencil or stick
  over the top of the glass or jar with the string hanging down inside.
  
  Heat the water to boiling, and dissolve the 2 cups of sugar into it. For
  the biggest crystals FAST, heat the sugar-water solution a SECOND time, and
  dissolve as much additional sugar as you can into it. Add a few drops of
  food coloring to the solution if desired.
  
  Pour the solution into the prepared glass or jar and leave undisturbed for
  a couple of days.  Depending on how much sugar you were able to dissolve
  into the water, you should start to see crystals growing in a few hours to
  a few days.

      1 ts Active dry yeast                    1 c  Flour *
    1/4 c  Warm water                     
 
  Dissolve yeast in warm water in 3-qt glass bowl. Stir in milk. Stir in
  flour gradually. Beat until smooht. Cover with towel; let stand in warm,
  draft-free place until starter begins to ferment, about 24 hrs. (bubbles
  will appear on surface of starter) If starter has not begun fermentation
  after 24 hr, discard and begin again. If fermentation has begun, stir well;
  cover tightly with plastic wrap and return to warm, draft-free place. Let
  stand until foamy, 2-3 days. When starter has become foamy, stir well; pour
  into 1-qt crock or glass jar with tighlty fitting cover. Store in frig.
  Starter is ready to use when a clear liquid has risen to top. Stir before
  using. Use 1 c starter in recipe; reserve remaining starter. Add 3/4 c milk
  and 3/4 c flour to reserved starter. Store covered at room temp until
  bubbles appear, about 12 hrs, refrigerate. Use starter regularly, every
  week to 10 days. If the volume of the breads you bake begins to decrease,
  dissolve 1 t yeast in 1/4 c warm water. Stir in 1/2 c milk, 3/4 c flour and
  the remaining starter. *DO NOT USE SELF RISING FLOUR* NOTE: Start bread at
  night to bake in the morning - or vice versa. Before adding the milk and
  flour to remaining starter, bake your bread and judge the volume

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           NFXS18B                         1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
      2 c  Rye flour                                Onion slice optional
      1 tb Yeast                          
 
  In a glass or ceramic bowl, or jar that has been scalded, combine flour and
  yeast, add water and blend well. Add onion slice, cover with platic wrap
  and pierce plastic with fork to release gases. Place in a warm, draft-free
  place, at an even 85F for 3 days.; stir several times daily. Remove onion
  slice and refrigerate until ready to use. Onion imparts a strong flavor and
  this starter can only be used with compatible rye recipes; rye starter
  without onion can be used in any rye sourdough recipe. To replenish, always
  use rye flour. If starter does not seem bubbly after replenishing and
  standing 12 hrs, sprinkle 1 t yeast over and stir in well. Like whole wheat
  starter, you may have to plan longer rising times for dough made with this
  one.

------------------------------PHILLY.INQUIRER------------------------------
      2 tb Or 2 envelopes active dry           1 c  Sugar
           Yeast                               2 c  All purpose white flour
    1/4 c  Warm water                          2 c  Milk (see note)
 
    DAY,1: Sprinkle yeast over warm water.Add 1 tablespoon of the sugar and
  let stand a few minutes until yeast is active and swelling.Combine
  remaining sugar,flour and milk in a 4 t0 6 quart glass,plastic or pottery
  bowl or container.(Do not use metal bowls or utensils as these may retard
  starter growth.)With a wooden spoon,stir in active yeast mixture.Cover
  loosely with a towel so Herman can breathe.Let stand in a warm draft free
  place overnight.
    DAYS,2,3,and 4:Stir daily with a wooden spoon.Keep covered.Keep cool.
    DAY,5: Stir in 1/2 cup sugar,1 cup milk and 1 cup flour.Let stand 24
  hours.
    DAYS,6,7,8,and 9:Stir daily with a wooden spoon.
    DAY,10: Repeat DAY 5,stirring in 1/2 cup sugar,1 cup milk and 1 cup
  flour.
    THIS gives you enough starter to use freely in recipes and/or give away.
  Herman may be replenished as needed but can go no more than 5 days at room
  temperature between feedings.After feeding,wait 24 hours before using the
  renewed starter.
    DAILY stirring helps keep yeast mold from forming.
    Most directions specify that Herman not be refrigerated since cooler
  temperatures slow the growth and "souring" of the starter.It is,however,a
  safer course for busy cooks with fast growing startersHerman also is
  freezer-friendly and may be kept on ice between baking impulses if you get
  board.
    NOTE: If desired,substitute butter-milk for milk in starter for more
  flavor and less fat.If more starter is needed,additions may be doubled when
  2 or more cups of starter are used.....

  Her speciality is finding recipes for people who have lost them,or had
  heard of them from someone else.These are tried and true recipes from
  people who use them all the time...I say this,because I do not what anyone
  to think this starter is a flight of fancy on my part or anyone elses..

      Title: Instant Potato Starter
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings

----------------------------------STARTER----------------------------------
      1 pk Dry yeast,                          2 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar                             1/2 c  Instant potato flakes
      2 c  Warm water,                   

------------------------------------FEED------------------------------------
    3/4 c  Sugar,                              1 ts Instant potato flakes
      1 c  Warm water,                   

-----------------------------------BREAD-----------------------------------
      1 c  Starter,                          1/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water                    1/2 c  Oil,
      1 ts Salt,                               6 c  Flour
 
  STARTER:  Dissolve yeast in 1/2 C. of warm water. Add remaining ingred. and
  stir well. Place in glass jar, covered loosely with foil, plastic wrap,
  etc. (to allow for gas expansion). Keep at room temperature for 24 hrs.
  Then place starter in frig. for 3-5 days. Feed: After starter has been
  refrigerated 3-5 days, take out and feed it above mixture. Let stand out
  (loosely covered) all day (8-10 hrs.). Take out 1 C. to use in making bread
  and return remaining starter to frig. Keep refrigerated from 3-5 days; feed
  again. After feeding, take out 1 C. to use in making bread, or give 1 C. to
  a friend, or throw 1 C. away. Starter must be fed again in 3-5 days. Bread:
  Mix first 5 ingred. together. Add in flour 1 C. at a time until thoroughly
  mixed. Knead until good "elastic" consistency, but don't over knead. Place
  approx. 2 Tbl. oil in bottom of large boowl; turn dough over so oiled side
  is facing up. Cover with dish towl; let rise until double - about 8-10 hrs.
  Punch down, knead again only a few times, mixing in flour until good
  consistency. Divide dough in half, shape into loaves. Place in ungreased
  loaf pans; let rise again (4-6 hrs.). Bake @ 350 for 25-35 min. until
  golden brown and loaves sound hollow when tapped. Cinnamon Bread: Before
  placing dough in loaf pans to rise, roll out, brush with melted butter,
  sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Roll up and place in loaf pan to rise.
  This is a great receipe - I've enjoyed it for years! Your starter should
  bubble a little after it has set out for the day (before you feed it). If
  not, I have added yeast to the warm water of the "feed" and added it in and
  the starter has recovered just fine! Enjoy! And let me know how you like
  it! Don in Arlington, TX 8/28 9:40 a.m.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
           -NORMA WRENN   (NPXR56B)            2 tb Sugar
      1 pk Dry yeast                           4 c  Flour
      4 c  -warm water                         1    Potato; raw quartered
 
  Here is a recipe from Texas Highways Cookbook.
  
  Dissolve yeast in warm water; and then mix all ingredients in a 1-gallon
  crock.  (Do not use metal container) Cover with a close-fitting lid and let
  the starter rise until light (12 hours in warm weather, longer in cool
  weather). Do not let the starter get cold, ever. After using part of the
  starter, add 1 cup warm water, 2 teaspoons sugar, and enough flour to mix
  to the starter's original consistency.  Add more potato occasionally as
  food for the yeast, but don't add more yeast. Use daily for best results.
  Starter improves with age. I am sure you will get some posts for flake
  starters.  I do not have one.

 Categories: Breads, Jewish
      Yield: 2 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Water,warm (110 degree)                  Needed.
      1 pk Yeast, dry                               Cornmeal (for sprinkling
    1/2 ts Sugar                                    The baking sheets)
      4 ts Salt                                     GLAZE:
      3 c  Rye sourdough starter               1    Egg white beaten with 2 tbs
           Measured after stirring down             Water.
           At room temperature.                     OPTIONAL TOPPING:
      2 c  Flour, gluten                       2 ts Chernushka (black caraway)
  3 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose or as                 Seeds.
 
  You can buy chernushka "black caraway" in some health food stores or from
  mail-order. They are nothing like the familiar caraway seeds. This bread is
  a New York specialty, usually made in bakeries.
  
  1.  Combine 1/2 cup of the warm water, the yeast and sugar and let stand
  until doubled in bulk, about 10 minutes. 2. Dissolve the salt in the
  remaining warm water in a mixing bowl. Mix in the sourdough starter, then
  the yeast mixture, then the gluten flour and 2 cups of the all-purpose
  flour; make a soft dough. 3. Spread 1 1/2 cups flour on the kneading
  surface and turn the dough out onto it. Knead, adding more flour if
  necessary to make a soft dough that will hold its shape. Do not overknead..
  the dough should be only slightly elastic, even a bit sticky. 4. Form the
  dough into a ball and put in an ungreased bowl; cover with plastic, and let
  rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. 5. Turn the dough out onto a
  lightly flour surface and knead it a few strokes to expel air. Cover with a
  towel and let rest for 15 minutes. 6. Divide the dough in half. Form each
  half into a loaf by flattening in to an inch-thick oval about 12 inches
  long, then rolling it up from one long side. Pinch the seam closed. Shape
  the ends of the oval loaves neatly and plce them on two cornmeal-dusted
  baking sheets, seam down. Cover with towels and let rise until
  "three-quarters proofed," or not fully doubled.

      Yield: 2 servings
 
 
  7.  While the loaves are rising, set a large roasting pan containing 2
  inches of boiling water on the oven floor (or the lowest shelf of an
  electric oven) and preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 8. Brush the loaves
  with egg-white glaze, being careful not to let the glaze drip onto the pan,
  as it sticks and burns.  With a single-edged razor blade or a small, sharp
  knife, cut three diagonal slashes, holding the blade almost parallel to the
  surface, about 1/4 inch deep on each loaf. Sprinkle the loaves with "black
  caraway" or caraway seeds, if you like. 9. Bake for 30 minutes on the
  middle and upper shelves of the oven, then brush again with glaze, exchange
  shelf positions, and remove the water pan. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes
  longer, or until there is a hollow sound when you rap the bottom of the
  loaf. 10. Cool the bread on racks.
  
  There is no historical or etymological theory for the term, "corn" in this
  bread.

  The 4-cup batch of starter made by this recipe is enough to bake any of the
  rye breads requiring a rye starter, with enough left over to serve as the
  nucleus for another baking. When you "feed" leftover starter... which
  should be done every 2 weeks or so.. add a little rye flour and water,
  using 3 parts of flour to 2 of water. To build up a small amount of starter
  to a quantity large enough for baking, do the job in several steps, never
  adding a larger measure of flour than the amount of starter on hand. Let
  the starter stand at room temperature overnight or for up to 24 hours,
  until it is bubbly and no longer smells floury. To increase further, add
  more flour and water in the same proportions and again let the starter
  ferment until it is bubbly enough to use.  Store leftover starter in the
  refrigerator between bakings and "feedings," and for indefinite storage,
  freeze it. Thaw, then feed the starter and let it ferment at room
  temperature before use.  Makes about 4 cups.
  
  1. Dissolve the yeast in 2 cups of the tepid water, then beat in 2 cups of
  the rye flour, beating until no lumps remain. Add the onion, cover loosely
  with a cloth, and let stand at room temperature for 24 hours. 2. Remove the
  onion.  Beat in 1 cup tepid water, then 1 1/2 cups rye flour. Cover with
  the cloth and let stand for 24 hours longer. The starter should now be
  pleasantly sour-smelling, almost beery, and bubbly. (Depending upon the
  temperature of the room, a slightly longer or shorter period of
  fermentation may produce this result.) TO USE: The starter is now ready for
  use and can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use, without further
  feeding. If you must hold the starter longer before use, the night before
  it is wanted, add 1/2 cup tepid water and 3/4 cup rye flour and let is
  stand at room temperature overnight.

           -JUDY LAUSCH DGSV34A                1 c  Warm water; (120-130*)
  4 1/2 c  Bread flour                         1 c  Sour cream; room temp.
      2 tb Wheat germ                          2 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Sugar                               1    Egg white
      2 ts Salt                                1 tb Water
    1/2 ts Ginger                              2 ts Poppy seeds
      2 pk Fast-acting dry yeast          
 
  1. In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 c flour, and next five ingredients (wheat
  germ, sugar, salt, ginger and yeast); blend well. Add water, sour cream and
  vinegar to flour mixture. Blend at low speed until mositened; beat 3
  minutes at medium speed. Stir in an additional 2 to 2 1/2 c flour until
  dough pulls cleanly away from sides of bowl. 2. On floured surface, knead
  in remaining 1/2 to 1 c flour until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5
  minutes. Place dough in greased bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap and
  cloth towel. Let rise in warm place until light and doubled in size, 25-35
  minutes. 3. Grease large cookie sheet. Punch down dough several times to
  remove all air bubbles. Allow to rest on counter covered with inverted bowl
  for 15 minutes. Divide dough in half; roll each half to 14x8" rectangle.
  Starting with longest side, roll up; pinch edges firmly to seal. Place seam
  side down on greased cookie sheet; taper ends to a point. With sharp knife,
  make five 1/4" deep diagonal slashes on top of each loaf. Cover; let rise
  in warm place until light and doubled in size, about 15 minutes. 4. Heat
  oven to 375*F. Bake 25 minutes. In small bowl, beat egg white and water.
  Remove bread from oven; brush with egg white mixture. Sprinkle with poppy
  seed. Return to oven. Bake an additional 5 to 10 minutes or until loaves
  sound hollow when lightly tapped. Immediately remove from cookie sheet;
  cool on wire racks. Makes 2 (17 oz.) loaves. A Pillsbury Bake-off winning

      2 ts Salt ;  lite                   
 
  I used the whole wheat starter and experimented with your whole wheat bread
  recipe in the DAK today. It turned out great. Basically, I just halved your
  recipe and added a few things. My DAK is a 3 cup flour model, is yours? If
  I'm using whole wheat or rye flour, I can add more flour because it doesn't
  rise as much. Also, whenever I use whole wheat, etc. I add vital wheat
  gluten and lecithin to aid elasticity and to help it rise.
   This is what I put in the DAK and the order I used: Turn the light/dark
  setting to 12 o'clock and set the menu to Sweet Bread (the auto. one, not
  the manual one) Later, at the beeps, I added 3/4 c. pecans (didn't have
  walnuts on hand). I usually add large pieces since they are kind of cut up
  by the B/M while knead ing. We can keep experimenting with this....let me
  know if you try it and what you add or subtract. Have you ever added
  raisins, oatmeal or any kind of seeds? The B/M gives me the lazy way out,
  and I wanted to see what it would do in it. Thanks so much for taking
  precious time to post the recipe. P.S. I have some of the beer s/d starter
  to give you when we get together, but the whole wheat starter is GREAT!.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
           -Anna Ellis DTXT63A                 1 tb Melted margarine
  1 1/4 c  Sourdough starter                   2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Water                           1 1/2 ts Salt
      3 c  Bread flour                         2 ts Yeast
 
  This basic recipe was from Anna Ellis (DMSD70C). I substituted oil for the
  margarine and with some experimentation, came up with this technique: Put
  all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle. When the cycle is
  complete, leave the dough in the pan for 3 to 4 more hours. Remove dough
  and squeeze out gases. Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 20 or 30
  minutes minutes. Sprinkle corn meal on a board and shape dough into two
  cylindrical loaves. Place loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet. Cover
  again with the damp towel and allow to rise for another two hours. At the
  end of two hours, refrigerate the dough, still covered, for at least 12
  hours (the longer the better). Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with
  water, and let it sit out for 4 hours. Sprinkle again with water then bake
  at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown and crusty.

  Put all ingreds. in order listed into pan, select "French" bread and push
  Start.  Tip: If you can, open lid and check while kneading to feel whether
  the dough is too wet or dry. Correct it with a Tbsp. or so of water or
  flour. Since you have made so much bread, you know how the dough should
  feel. FROM:    JUDY GARNETT (PJXG05A)

           -posted by Gaye Levy DTXT63A      3/4 ts Salt
  1 1/8 c  Sourdough starter               2 1/4 c  Bread flour
    1/2 c  Water                           1 1/2 ts Yeast
  1 1/4 ts Sugar                          
 
  This is for the medium sized loaf which, depending on how active my starter
  is at the moment, will rise to the top of my Hitachi B101.
  
  If I want an extra sour loaf, I will use the starter two or three days
  after feeding. This produces a shorter loaf with a heavier texture.
  
  For a light and fluffy loaf, I feed the starter first, then let it sit on
  the counter for 8 to 10 hours before using. I make sure it is very foamy
  when I put it in the B/M.

      Title: Oven-Dried Tomatoes
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
 
        Olive oil
        Salt and pepper
        Tomatoes, preferably plum
        Fresh herbs (optional):
        -Thyme, rosemary, oregano,
        -=OR=- garlic
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Lightly oil a cookie sheet or baking pan with olive
  oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Slice tomatoes (plum tomatoes work
  best) crosswise into 1-inch slices. Pack tightly together on the pan;
  ideally the tomatoes should fill the entire pan. Drizzle the tomatoes
  lightly with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with
  fresh herbs if desired (use thyme, rosemary, oregano or garlic, alone or in
  combination). Roast for 45 minutes to a hour. The tomatoes should be

  and rich the longer the tomatoes are left in the oven.

      Title: Worried Fried Green Tomatoes
 Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Green tomatoes, sliced verti             Salt
           -cally 1/4 inch thick                    Pepper
      3 ea Garlic, clove, sliced               4 tb Olive oil
    3/4 c  Flour                          
 
  Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time: 30 1) Shake
  tomato slices in a paper sack with salt, pepper and flour. 2) Heat oil over
  medium-high heat in a black iron skillet. Add tomatoes and garlic. Cook
  without stirring for about 5 minutes, then, using a stiff spatula, scrape
  bottom of skillet and turn tomatoes. Continue to cook over medium to high
  heat, scraping bottom of skillet occasionally to prevent burning. You want
  the tomatoes which come in direct contact with the skillet to get dark. You
  should expect some sticking; just scrape hard. Try to resist adding more
  oil but do so if you must. 3) When most of the tomatoes have turned olive
  green or dark brown, about 20 minutes, lower heat to low. Continue to cook,
  worrying the tomatoes around with the spatula until they are all either
  brown or olive green. (Don't worry them too much; if you are too worrisome
  they turn mushy.) (Old family recipe; garlic and olive oil are my
  additions.) Source: Overton Anderson
