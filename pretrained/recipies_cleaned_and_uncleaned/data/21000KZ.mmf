  today.
  
  Melt the butter, and whisk in flour.  Add meat broth or water. Add the
  rinsed and chopped herbs, and briefly bring to a boil. Let soup cool
  a bit, then thicken with egg yolk. Season with salt, pepper, and a

  on top of the soup.

      Title: SAUERBRATEN (POT ROAST)
 Categories: Penndutch, Beef
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 lb Beef **
      1 pt Vinegar
      1 x  Water
      4 ea Bay leaf
     12 ea Peppercorns, whole, black
      4 ea Cloves, whole
      1 ea Carrot, bunch
      6 ea Onion
      1 tb Sugar
     12 ea Gingersnaps
      1 x  Salt & pepper
 
  ** Use beef chuck, rump, or round. *** My notes: Watch meat while it
  sits and add more vinegar and water (half of each) to keep meat
  covered. A similar recipe in Bon Appetit used red vinegar and red
  wine for the marinade and the beef was left in the refrigerator for
  about 9 days. Wipe meat with damp cloth and then sprinkle thoroughly
  with salt and pepper. Place meat in an earthen dish and add vinegar
  and enough water to cover. Add the bay leaves, peppercorns and
  cloves, and let stand tightly covered for 5 days in a cool place. Cut
  carrots in strips; slice onions. Put meat in a dutch oven and brown
  well on all sides. Add the carrots and onions and 1 cup of the spiced
  vinegar. Cover tightly and cook over low flame about 3 hours or until
  meat is tender. When meat is cooked, add the sugar and crumbled
  ginger snaps and cook for 10 minutes. This makes delicious gravy. If
  necessary, more of the spiced vinegar may be added. Source:

  pepper, cloves, bay leaves, sugar, and salt and pour over meat.
  Fasten bag tightly and lay flat in a 13 x 9-inch pan. Refrigerate,

  marinate 4 days.) When ready to cook, remove meat (saving marinade)
  and dry well. Rub the surface lightly with flour. In Dutch oven, heat
  oil or shortening and slowly brown the meat well on all sides.  Add 1
  cup of the marinade liquid plus some of the vegetables and bay
  leaves. Cover tightly and simmer on surface heat or in a preheat, 350
  F oven for 3 to 4 hours until the meat is fork-tender. If needed, add
  more marinade during cooking to keep at least 1/2-inch liquid in the
  Dutch oven. Remove the meat and keep warm until ready to slice. Into
  a large measuring cup, strain the drippings. Add several ice cubes
  and let stand a few minutes until the fat separates out. Remove fat,
  then make gravy. TO MAKE THE GRAVY:  In the Dutch oven, combine the
  gravy ingredients, stir and cook about 5 minutes over medium heat
  until gravy is thickened. Taste for seasonings. Makes 3 cups of
  gravy. Makes 8 servings.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Pork
      1 x  Water
      1 qt Sauerkraut
      1 x  Salt & pepper
 
  Wipe piece of pork with a damp cloth, place in large stewing pan and
  cover with cold water. Set over flame to cook slowly for one hour.
  Add the sauerkraut and more water if necessary and continue cooking
  for another hour or until meat has become thoroughly tender. Season
  with salt and pepper. Serve with mashed potatoes. My notes: This is
  basically the same way my mom and I prepare sauerkraut and spareribs,
  but we add a chopped onion.  My mom also used to add some chopped
  apple to cut down on the "sourness".  This is a really simple and
  delicious meal, if you like sauerkraut. One of my favorites! Source:

      1 tb Olive oil
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 lb Endives
  1 1/2 tb Butter
           Salt, pepper, lemon juice to
           -taste

MMMMM-------------------RED BELL PEPPER SAUCE------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Shallots; finely chopped
    1/2 c  White wine
    1/3 c  Fish stock
    2/3 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Red bell pepper; very finely
           -chopped
 
  SAUCE: In a saucepan, saute shallots in a teaspoon or so of butter
  until transparent. Add white wine and reduce (simmer) the mixture
  until it reaches a pasty consistency (about half an hour). Add fish
  stock, heavy cream, and red bell pepper.  Simmer slowly until creamy
  (40 minutes or so, depending on desired consistency).
  
  ENDIVES: After washing endives, cut in two lengthwise, then remove
  tough centers and bases.  Cut julienne style into very thin strips
  and stack together. Melt butter in a large frying pan and add
  endives. Saute for about half an our at medium heat until cooked
  through. When finished, the endives should be soft, moldable,
  brownish, almost transparent, and their sharp bitterness should be
  replaced by a milder taste. Lightly salt and pepper, then ass a
  little lemon juice.
  
  SALMON: Preheat oven to 400 degrees, and stove to high heat. In a
  non-stick frying pan, heat olive oil to very hot, then sear the
  aslmon on both sides until brown.  Salt and pepper both sides of
  salmon, place in a roasting pan and roast for about 5 minutes.
  
  DISH DISPLAY: PLace half the sauteed endives on the left side of the
  plate in a rounded, flattened shape to createa "carpet" on which to
  place the salmon.  Using half the sauce, pour most of it on the lower
  portion of the plate, drizzle some of it around and endivces and save
  the rest. Place a salmon filet on top of the endive "carpet" and pour
  the remaining sauce portion over the salmon. Serve with colourful
  steamed vegetables (placed on the remaining third of the plate) if
  desired, and French bread on the side.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Breakfast sausage
    1/4 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 c  Milk; or half milk,
           Half cream
 
  Make the biscuits with baking mix such as Jiffy or Bisquik, cutting
  in some additional butter if fat and calories don't scare you.
  
      Break up the sausage as you brown it in frying pan. Then remove
  meat and set aside.
      Drain all but about 1/4 cup of the fat from the pan; remove pan
  from heat and stir in flour.  Add milk gradually, stirring.
      Return pan to heat and cook as with any white sauce, stirring
  until thick and smooth.
      Return sausage to sauce, turn heat low, and let simmer a bit to
  blend flavors.
      Taste for seasoning; you are unlikely to want pepper, but you may
  need a bit more salt.
      Serve with eggs of you choice, but scrambled is my preference...

 Categories: Cajun
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Oil
      1    Chicken; cut up or boned
  1 1/2 lb Andouille
      4 c  Onions; chopped
      2 c  Celery; chopped
      2 c  Green pepper
      1 tb Garlic; chopped
      4 c  Rice, long grained
      5 c  Chicken stock
  2 1/2 ts Salt
           Cayenne; to taste
      2 c  Green onions; chopped
 
  Season and brown chicken in oil (lard, bacon drippings are
  traditional) over med-high heat. Add sausage to pot (cut in 1/4"
  rounds) and saute with chicken. Remove both from pot. For brown
  jambalaya, either add heaping Tbsp brown sugar to hot oil and
  caramelize, make roux, or use Kitchen Bouquet. For red jambalaya,
  delete this. (I prefer to make a deep chestnut colored roux). Saute
  onions, celery, green pepper and garlic to the tenderness that you
  desire. Return chicken and sausage to pot. Add liquid and salt,
  pepper, and other desired seasonings and bring to boil. If using
  Kitchen Bouquet for brown jambalaya, add 1-2 Tbsp. For red jambalaya,
  add approx 1/4 cup paprika, and you may want to use 1/2 stock and 1/2
  tomato juice or V-8 for your liquid. Add rice and return to boil.
  Cover and reduce heat to simmer. Cook for total of 30 minutes. After
  10 minutes of cooking, remove cover and quickly turn rice from top to
  bottom completely. Add green onions and chopped tomatoes if desired.
  For seafood jambalaya, follow the first two steps, and then return
  seafood here.
  
  NOTE: 1 cup raw long grain rice will feed 3 people.  4 keys: 1 cup
  rice to a total of 2 cups of trinity in any combination (trinity =
  onions, celery and green pepper) 1 cup raw rice to 1-1/4 cups liquid
  overseason to compensate for the rice. Cook for a total of 30
  minutes, turning completely after 10 minutes.

      Title: SAUSAGE & MUSHROOM PHYLLO TWISTS
 Categories: Appetizers, Pork, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Pork sausage meat crumbled
      1    Minced small onion
      1    Minced garlic clove
      1 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 lb Mushroom chopped fine
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
      1 pn Of allspice
    1/2 ts Dried crumbled mint
    1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley leaves
      2 oz Cream cheese softened
     16    12 inch sheets phyllo
           -stacked between 2 sheets of
           -wax
           Paper and covered with damp
           -dish towel
    1/4 c  Clarified butter
      2 tb Fine fresh bread crumbs
 
  In a large skillet cook the sausage meat over moderately high heat,
  stirring and breaking up any larger pieces, until it is cooked
  through and browned.
  
  Transfer meat to a fine sieve, and drain. In the skillet, cook the
  onion and the garlic in the unsalted butter over moderately low heat
  until the onion is softened. Add the mushrooms, and cook the mixture
  over moderate heat, stirring until the liquid  the mushrooms give off
  evaporates. Add the cumin, allspice and the mint and cook the
  mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes.
  
  Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the sausage meat, the parsley,
  cream cheese, and salt and pepper to taste, and combine the mixture
  well. Working quickly to keep the phyllo from drying out, put 1 sheet
  of phyllo on a work surface, brush lightly with some of the clarified
  butter, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the bread crumbs. Lay
  another sheet of phyllo on top of the first sheet and brush lightly
  with some of the remaining clarified butter.
  
  Cut the sheets into thirds lengthwise and into quarters crosswise to
  form 12 squares. Put a rounded teaspoon of the filling in each
  square, gather the corners of the phyllo over the filling, and twist
  the phyllo gently to seal it. Continue to make hors d'oeuvres in the
  same manner with the remaining phyllo, butter, crumbs and filling.
  Bake the sausage and mushroom phyllo twists in jelly-roll pans in a
  preheated oven at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes,or until phyllo is
  golden brown.

  RE: Crock pot recipes
  
  DC>I am not the most creative person in the world when it comes to
  using my crock pot.  Do any of you have favorite recipes you could
  post for me?
  
  Here are a couple of things that I make in mine.  I don't have exact
  measurements though, because these are just things I thought up
  myself.
  
  Brown italian sausage (I usually get about two pounds) in skillet or
  put under
  
  broiler just till browned.  Drain off fat and let cool just till you
  can handle them. Meanwhile they are browning, cup up a whole bunch of
  onions and peppers, and if you want, add a clove of garlic. Place
  vegees in crockpot. Then cut up sausage in very small pieces. Add to
  crockpot. Cover with an eight-ounce can tomato sauce and add oregano,
  basil or whatever. Sook about six or seven hours. Serve in sub rolls
  or on hamburger burns or over rice.
  
        2    Barbecued Beef
  
  Get a very small pot roast.  Season and put in crockpot. Cover with
  barbecue
  
  sauce.  Add more sauce near the end because the sauce will lose its
  flavor during cooking, or add new sauce after slicing. Remove roast
  from crockpot after cooking, and slice into thin slices. (maybe
  slices isn't the right word,
  
  it kind of shreds.)  Anyway, serve in hamburger buns. Good with baked
  beans and salad.

      1 cn Franco-American Brown Gravy
      2    Onions diced
      1    Bunch Shallots diced

           Tiger sauce
           Hot sauce
           Tony's Chachere's Seasoning
           Kitchen Bouquet
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Stephen Brown This recipe for Jambalaya
  comes from my father-in-law, who won the Oak Alley Jambalaya cooking
  contest with it twice. Even this transplanted Yankee has had good
  luck with it. Sausage & Pork Jambalaya
  
  Brown the pork in a large pot with a small amount of water on the
  bottom to prevent sticking. Cover, stir occasionally. Add Onions, and
  continue to saute. When onions are transparent, add sausage, and
  continue to saute. When the meats are cooked, add the brown gravy and
  cook a few more minutes. Add the water -- You need to add an *equal*
  amount of water as you are using rice. 5 Cups, in this case. (Usually
  the rice is measured by the pound, in which case you would pour into
  a bowl and add that amount of water). Allow the water to heat, then
  turn off the heat and cover. Allow the grease to rise to the top.
  Skim off the grease with a large spoon. Conserve the grease. After
  skimming the grease, add an amount of water equal to the amount of
  grease to replace the liquid lost. Bring to almost boiling, and add
  your seasonings. You can use whatever seasonings you want, but the
  key is that it should be saltier and hotter now than you want the
  finished product. Heat the spices a few minutes, and taste. Add more
  spices until you are happy with the outcome. At this point you can
  add the shallots. (We save the greens until now, since they float,
  and they would be in the way of tasting the spices). One optional
  step is to add a small amount of Kitchen Bouquet to give the
  Jambalaya a rich brown color. Bring to a rolling boil. Add the rice
  all at once and stir. Continue with high heat and stirring often
  until the mixture becomes milky with the rice. Reduce the heat
  slightly, and cover. Now you only want to open and stir the rice
  occasionally, as the rice is steaming. When removing the cover, do
  not allow the water to drip back into the pot. Wipe the lid before
  returning the lid to the pot. Stir quickly, but be sure to scrape the
  bottom to prevent sticking. This is really the tricky part... As the
  liquid drys up, you need to reduce the heat even further and allow
  the rice to finish steaming. Stir every few minutes, scraping bottom.
  The Jambalaya is finished when the rice is tender and "done."
  
  This recipe can be increased or reduced proportionally. The first
  time I made it I used 2 pounds of rice. The second time used 35
  pounds!

  dish in a hot and cold buffet. It can serve as a main dish with a
  side of pasta or rice. Also makes a great hot sandwich on Italian
  bread.or great pocket sandwich on syrian (pita) bread. It also makes
  great table art when you drop it on a white tablecloth (smile). Its a
  very versitle dish can substitute with any kind of meat.Enjoy!

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 lb Italian sausage
      2 md Onions
    1/2 lb Mushrooms
      1 sm Green pepper
           -(or use frozen
           -diced pepper)
      1 sm Eggplant
      1 md Tomato
      8 oz Tomato sauce
           -(1 standard can)
           Salt, pepper, oregano
           -to taste
 
  Slice the sausage into bite-size morsels and saute until browned.
  Remove from pan, leaving fat for next step. (While the sausages are
  browning, you can cut up the vegetables.)
  
  Slice the onions and the mushrooms.  Cut the peppers into 1/2-inch
  squares and dice the tomato. Cut the eggplant into a julienne style.
  
  Add a little oil to the pan and saute the onions, peppers, mushrooms,
  eggplant and tomato until the onions are transparent and soft. Add the
  tomato sauce and the spices and return the sausage to the pan. Cook
  about 15 minutes. Serve with fettucine.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spaghetti sauce with sausage, mushrooms and eggplant -- I made up
  this recipe the other day to use up some eggplant. It was an instant
  hit. Yield: serves 13.
  
  *  Zucchini can be substituted for the eggplant, and canned tomatoes
  can be substituted for the tomato and sauce. The sauce should be
  relatively thick. The sausage can be hot or mild Italian sausage, but
  if you use mild sausage you will need to add more spices.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  Place 1 strip of phyllo on work surface; brush top lightly with melted
  butter.  Place about 1 teaspoon sausage mixture at end of strip. Fold
  one corner of strip diagonally over filling so that short edge meets
  the long edge of the strip, forming a right angle. Continue folding
  over at right angle.  Continue folding over at right angles until you
  reach the end of the strip to form a triangular-shaped package. Place
  package, seam-side down, in 15 1/2" X 10 1/2" jelly-roll pan; brush
  with butter. Repeat with remaining phyllo strips and sausage mixture.
  If not serving right away, cover with foil and refrigerate.

  browned and cooked through. Sprinkle with anise seed, coating the
  sausages evenly. 5. Stuff 1 sausage inside each piece of zucchini.
  Put the stuffed pieces back into the skillet. Add the small zucchini
  rounds and hollowed-out pulp. 6. Combine the water, turmeric, cumin,
  paprika, coriander, garlic, tomato and salt to taste and pour over
  the zucchini. Cook, turning the zucchini pieces, about 5 min. Cover
  closely and continue cooking 30 min. Turn the pieces often in the
  cooking liquid so that they cook evenly. If, as the zucchini cook,
  the water becomes too little, add up to 1/2 cup more. When ready, the
  zucchini should be very tender and the sauce cooked downed to about
  1/3 cup. 7. Remove and discard the garlic cloves. Serve hot or cold.

      Title: SAUSAGE: CASING INFORMATION & PREPARATION
 Categories: Crs, Makemeat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Information Only
 
  Sausage has to be stuffed into something and that something is most
  often the intestine of a hog, cow, or sheep. Before you gasp, rest
  assured that these casings are kept scruplously clean and are packed
  in salt which keeps them fresh indefinitely. Natural casings come in
  an array of sizes, ranging from under one inch to a lillt over four
  inches in diameter. The smallest are usually sheep casings, 1/2" to 1
  1/16" and the largest are from beef, 2 1/2" to 4'. think of sheep
  casings as being the size of most hot dogs, and beef casings the size
  of a large salami. The hog casings are the most common since many
  sausages are made in the two inch diameter range. Their sizes range
  from small (1 1/2 inch), medium (2 inch), and large (2 1/2 inches).
  all should be kept refrigerated or frozen until ready to use. You
  should be familiar with two other types of casing; collagen and
  muslin. Collagen casings are made of natural, pure, edible protein.
  They generally cost a little more than intestines, are sometimes a
  little harder to find, but are convienent to use and usually can be
  substituted freely for recipes calling for natural casings. Muslin
  casings can be purchased or homemade and are sometimes used with
  summer sausage and salami. One needn't be a Betsy Ross to stitch up a
  muslin casing. Just follow the instructions given in Chapter 4.
  
  Muslin Casing: You will need a piece of unbleached muslin about 12"
  long and 8" wide. Fold the muslin lengthwise and tightly stitch a
  seam across one of the short ends and continue along the open side.
  Keep the stitching about an eight of an inch from the edge of the
  material. The short side of the seam can be curved in a semi-circle
  to give the finished product a rounded end. Turn the casing inside
  out so that the stitching is on the inside. Set it aside until you
  are ready to stuff it.
  
  Casing Preparation: Snip off about four feet of casing. (Better too
  much than too little because any extra can be repacked in salt and
  used later.) Rinse the casing under cool running water to remove any
  salt clinging to it. Place it in a bowl of cool water and let it soak
  for about a half an hour. While waiting for the casing to soak, you
  can begin preparing the meat. After soaking, rinse the casing under
  cool running water. Slip one end of the casing over the faucet
  nozzle. Hold the casing firmly on the nozzle, and turn the cold water
  on, gently at first, and then more forcefully. This procedure will
  flush out any salt in the casing and pinpoint any breaks. Should you
  find a break, simply snip out a small section of the casing. Place
  the casig in a bowl of water and add a splash of white vinegar. A
  tablespoon of vinegar per cup of water is sufficient. The vinegar
  softens the casing a bit more and makes it more transparent, which in
  turn makes your sausage more pleasing to the eye. Leave the casing in
  the water/vinegar solution until you are ready to use it. Rinse it
  well and drain before stuffing.

 Categories: Side dishes, Kooknet
      Yield: 4 To 6)
 
MMMMM--------------------SOURCE: VOGE JAN'94-------------------------
    680 ea Zucchinis, preferably small
           -young  ones,  very  firm
           -and   fresh
      8 tb Olive oil
      3 ea Cloves garlic,  peeled  and
           - chopped medium fine
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
    1/4 ts Fresh oregano leaves
 
  Soak the zucchini for 10  minutes  in  a basin of cold water. Then
  scrub them under  cold  running  water until the skin feels clean and
  smooth. If the skin is flabby or blemished, and still feels a bit
  gritty, scrape away or lightly peel the thin top layer. Cut off and
  discard both ends from all the zucchinis. Slice the zuc- chinis into
  very thin discs and set aside. Choose   a    frying pan deep enough
  to contain all the sliced zucchini without piling them up more than
  2.Scm to 3.5cm high. Put in the oil and garlic, and turn the heat on
  to medium. When the garlic has colored lightly, add the zucchini, 2
  or 3 large pinches of salt, some pepper, and the oregano, Turn the
  heat up to medium high, and cook, uncovered, stirring frequently. If
  the zucchini are as fresh as they ought to be, they will be done in
  less than 10 minutes. They should be tender but still a little firm.
  Drain away most of the oil before serving, leaving just enough to
  coat the zucchini, and for a crusty piece of good bread to mop up.
  Note: this dish can be prepared entirely in advance, several hours
  before serving. Do not refrigerate. Reheat gently just before
  serving. (Copyright: The Second Classic Italian Cookbook by Marcella

      Title: SAUTEED BREAST OF PHEASANT WITH WILD MUSHROOMS
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Pheasants, about 1 lb. each
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
     16    Thin asparagus
           - trimmed to 3-inch tips
      1 c  Kale (packed)
           - torn into 1-inch pieces
      1 lg Ripe tomato; peeled
      6 tb Butter
      2    Shallots; finely chopped
      1    Leek; white part only,
           - thinly sliced
      2 lg Scallions; sliced
      8 lg Shitake mushrooms
           - stems removed,
           - cut into 3/4-inch wedges
      1 c  Chicken or Poultry stock
    1/4 c  Dry white wine
 
  Disjoint the pheasants and reserve the legs for another use.  Bone the
  breasts and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Reserve the bones,
  gizzards and wings for making Poultry Stock.
  
  Cook the asparagus for 3 minutes in boiling salted water and transfer
  to a bowl of ice water.  Cook the kale for 2 minutes and drain and
  chill it in the ice water.  Squeeze out the kale and drain both
  asparagus and kale on paper towels.
  
  Halve the tomato and scoop out and discard the pulp.  Cut the shell
  into thin strips and reserve.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet and add the
  pheasant breasts, skin side down; cook 3 to 4 minutes more, just
  until golden but still pink in the center.  Transfer the breasts to a
  plate, cover loosely with foil and keep warm.
  
  Wipe the skillet and add 2 tablespoons of fresh butter.  When it is
  hot, add the shallots, leek, scallions and mushrooms and cook,
  partially covered, for 3 minutes, stirring once or twice.  Add the
  stock, wine and salt and pepper to taste, and cook for about 5
  minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and the liquid is reduced by
  half.
  
  Heat the remaining butter in a skillet.  Add the asparagus and cook
  just to warm through.  Arrange them in a fan to one side of each of 4
  warmed plates.  Add the kale to the skillet and stir to warm through
  and gloss with the butter.  Divide among the plates.
  
  Cut the pheasant breasts into thin diagonal slices and place them on
  the kale.  Cover with some of the mushroom mixture.
  
  Toss the tomato strips in the skillet for 30 seconds, just to take
  off the chill, and arrange a few pieces on each of the plates.

      Title: SAUTEED BROOK TROUT WITH ORANGE
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Rainbow trout fillets
    1/4 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Flour; for dredging
           -Salt
           -Freshly ground pepper
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 cn Mandarin oranges; drained
      2 sm Leeks
    1/2 ts Thyme
  1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
      3 tb Vodka
      1 tb Butter; softened
 
  Soak the fish briefly in the milk in a flat pan such as a pie pan. In
  another pie pan, season the flour with salt and pepper. Remove the
  trout from the milk and dredge the fillets in the flour, shaking to
  remove excess flour. Saut‚ the trout in the olive oil on medium high
  heat in a heavy skillet, 2-3 minutes per side until thoroughly
  cooked. Remove and set aside; keep warm. Pour any excess fat from the
  skillet. Clean and slice the white parts of the leeks into 1/4"
  rings, including only a little of the green section. Place the orange
  sections, the leeks, and the thyme in the skillet and toss briefly
  just to warm through.  The leeks should not get brown.  Stir in the
  lemon juice, vodka, and the soft butter. Reduce heat and blend well.
  Place the saut‚ed trout on warm plates and divide the sauce over the
  fish portions.  Garnish with fresh basil or parsley. Note: The
  original recipe called for 2 Tb. olive oil and 2 tb butter. I cut
  both to 1 Tb and it was quite good with half the fat.

 Categories: Game
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Buffalo steaks or chops
    1/4 c  Butter
           Salt & pepper
 
  Melt butter in a heavy skillet. Sauté steaks or chops until nicely
  browned on both sides. Turn as often as needed. Sprinkle with salt

  These cuts are cooked best when the center of the meat is light pink.
  Do not crowd pieces in the pan. Overcooking makes buffalo tough.

    1/3 c  Creme fraiche ( or heavy cre
 
    1/2 cup fresh blueberries (optional garnish) Melt the butter in a
  large heavy skillet and gently saute the scallions for 5 mins. Shake
  the flour in a plastic bag with the spices, salt and pepper. Drop the
  livers into the bag with the flour,shake them to coat well, and empty
  bag into a strainer set over a bowl. Shake the strainer to remove
  excess flour. Return the skillet with the scallions to the stov,raise
  the heat,and when hot add livers and cook, turning occasion-ally,for
  about 5 mins.or until livers are browned slightly stiffened. Remove
  them with a spoon and keep warm. Add the vinegar to the skillet and
  deglqaze over high heat, scraping up any browned bits and reducing
  the vinegar to a few syrupy spoonfuls. Whisk in the creme fraiche and
  boil for 1 min.  If you are using fresh blueberrie, add them to the
  sauce and simmer gently for another 2 or 3 mins, just long enough to
  heat the berries through without overcooking them. Arrange the livers
  on serving dishes and spoon the sauce over them. Serve immediately. 4
  portions as an appetizer, 2 or3 portions as main course. This is not
  my cup of tea 'cause I don't like liver,bit if you do, it sounds
  interesting. In The New Basics Cookbook, by the same ladies,they say
  to use fruit vinegars in salad dressings with nut or olive oils.
  Fruit salads are also enhanced by a touch of fruit vinegar. I hope
  this helps you a little. I know it's not much..

 Categories: Chinese, Chicken, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      9    Scallions
      5 oz Boneless chicken thighs
      2 ts Tamari or other soy sauce +
           -more for serving
           Oriental sesame oil
           -(optional)
           Salt and pepper
    1/2 lb Wonton skins
      6 tb Peanut oil
    1/2 ts Minced fresh ginger
      1 tb Sesame seeds
           Salt and pepper
 
  CHICKEN-TAMARI FILLING:
  
  For the filling, cut the scallions into thin slices. In a meat
  grinder or food processor, grind the meat to a coarse texture, being
  careful not to overprocess. Stir in 1/4 of the scallions, 2 teaspoons
  tamari, the sesame oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.
  
  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Put about 1 tablespoon
  of the filling in the center of a wonton skin. Brush the edges of the
  skin with warm water, top with another skin, and press gently around
  the filling to seal the edges.  Repeat until all the filling is used.
  Slide wontons into boiling water, stirring gently, and cook for 2
  minutes. Drain carefully and plunge into cold water to stop cooking.
  Drain again. Toss with 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil.
  
  Mince the ginger.  In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the
  peanut oil over medium heat.  Add the sesame seeds; cook, stirring
  frequently, until just golden, about 1 minute. Stir in the ginger.
  Add the remaining scallions and cook until soft, about 2 minutes.
  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  Recipe can be made up to this point several hours ahead.
  
  Cooking and Serving:  Heat 2 more tablespoons of the peanut oil over
  medium heat.  Brown the wontons in batches, adding the remaining
  peanut oil between additions, or use 2 pans. Cook until both sides
  are golden, about 4 minutes total.  Top wontons with the
  scallion-sesame mixture. Serve additional tamari on the side for
  dipping.

   SAUTEED GARLIC, RED PEPPERS, CHICORIES, CHARD, AND SPINACH FOR WHITE
  CHEDDAR POLENTA From Potager: Fresh Garden Cooking in the French
  Style by Georgeanne Brennan Pour the water into a saucepan, salt it,
  and bring it to a boil over high heat.  Add the polenta in a very
  slow, steady stream, stirring as you pour. Reduce the heat and cook
  for 40 to 45 minutes, stirring frequently. The polenta is done when
  it pulls away slightly from the sides of the pan.
   While the polenta is cooking, wash the greens carefully to remove
  any bits of sand or grit.  With a sharp knife, cut the leaves
  lengthwise into 2 or 3 strips.  Dry the greens thoroughly in a salad
  spinner or gather them up in a clean cloth and roll them dry.
   Cut the peppers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and ribs.
  Cut the halves lengthwise into thin slices.
   Just before the polenta is ready, heat the olive oil in a large
  skillet and add the garlic and sweet peppers. Saute for 2 or 3
  minutes and then add the greens. Sprinkle with the salt, reduce the
  heat, cover the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. The greens will
  steam and reduce considerably in volume. Remove the cover and
  continue cooking until the greens are limp but still retain their
  color, a few minutes.
   When the polenta is done, stir in the butter, cheese, salt, and
  pepper. Remove the pan from the heat and spread the polenta onto a
  warmed serving platter.  Top it with the mixture of sauteed greens
  and peppers and serve at once.  Serves 4.

  and age of the beans. Remember that this is only a preliminary
  preparation so do not overcook the beans. Drain the beans and place
  them immediately into the ice water. Stir until cool, then drain.
  Spread the beans on towels and pat dry. Meanwhile, slice mushrooms
  thinly and set aside on a plate. Heat the oil and butter in a medium

 Categories: Seafood, Appetizers
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Spinach, fresh
  1 1/2 lb Salmon fillets; skinless
           Salt
           Pepper
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 lg Onion, yellow; finely chopt
      2    Garlic clove; pressed
      3 tb Lemon juice
      3 tb Parsley, fresh; minced
 
  Wash greens thoroughly and remove tough stems; cut leaves into thin
  strips and set aside.  Rinse salmon and pat dry. Hold knife at an
  angle and slice salmon into 4 or 8 equal pieces. Place each piece of
  fish between 2 pieces of waxed paper, the cut sides against paper,
  and pound gently with a mallet or rolling pin to create slices of
  even thickness (about 1/8 inch thick). Season scallops of salmon with
  salt and pepper if desired. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a
  5- to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and stir until
  tender but not brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and greens;
  cook, stirring, until the greens are just tender, about 3 minutes.
  Transfer greens to a bowl and keep warm. Heat about 1 teaspoon of the
  remaining oil in the pan, or in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, over
  medium-high heat. Add scallops to pan in a single layer (you will
  cook salmon in several batches) and cook until edges turn opaque, 20
  to 30 seconds.  Turn scallops and cook other side about 15 seconds.
  Lift cooked salmon from pan and keep warm. Repeat with remaining
  scallops, adding additional oil if necessary to prevent sticking.
  When scallops are cooked, add the lemon juice to the pan and scrape
  the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen browned bits.
  Stir in the parsley and set aside. To serve, divide greens among
  warmed plates, top with 1 or 2 of the salmon scallops, pour the pan
  sauce over each serving.

MMMMM-------------------------EQUIPMENT------------------------------
           Small bowl
           10" skillet
 
  Santa Barbara shrimp, found in the Pacific Ocean, are most prized for
  their taste and their size.  They are usually sold with head and tail
  intact. However, Gulf shrimp make a good substitute.
  
  1. Remove the heads of the shrimp and peel the shell, leaving the tail
  intact.  Season lightly with salt and pepper and set aside.
  
  2. Prepare the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, combine the tomatoes,
  shallots, garlic, basil, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.
  Stir in the vinegar, lime juice, and 1/2 cup olive oil, and mix well.
  
  3. Heat a 10" skillet and pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive
  oil. Over medium-high heat, cook the shrimp, in batches, if
  necessary, about 1-1/2 minutes per side. Do not crowd the pan. Do not
  overcook -- well-done shrimp will become dry.
  
  Presentation: Spoon vinaigrette into the center of each of 4 plates.
  Arrange 4 shrimp on the vinaigrette and garnish with basil sprigs.
  Serve immediately.
  
  To prepare ahead: Through step 2, but season the shrimp when ready to
  serve.

 Categories: Vegetable
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Fresh spinach -- washed and
           Trimmed
      3 tb Vegetable oil -- or less
    1/4 c  Chopped macadamia nuts
      2 ts Fresh ginger root -- grated
      2    Cloves garlic -- minced
      2 tb Soy sauce, low sodium
  1 1/2 ts Rice wine vinegar -- to
           Taste
 
  Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Have ready a large bowl of ice
  water. Blanch spinach for 1 minute in the boiling water, then quickly
  remove it and plunge it into the bowl of ice water. This quick
  process preserves the bright green of the spinach and keeps it from
  overcooking. Drain the spinach well, then squeeze out as much
  moisture as possible. Transfer the spinach to a cutting board and
  coarsely chop it. Heat oil in a large skillet. Add the macadamia
  nuts. Saute the nuts until they just begin to brown, about 1 minute.
  Add the ginger and garlic. Saute about 30 seconds longer. Do not
  allow the garlic to brown. Add the spinach and soy sauce, and saute
  2-3 minutes longer, until the spinach is heated through. Remove from
  heat, splash with rice vinegar, and serve immediately. Alternative:
  Brown the nuts in a dry pan and remove. Heat 1 or 2 teaspoons of
  canola oil and warm the ginger and garlic. Continue as directed in
  the original version. [mcRecipe 19Au96 patH] Recipe By

      Title: SAUTEED SWEET POTATOES
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lg Sweet potatoes
    1/4 lb Butter (1 stick)
    2/3 c  Tequila
    1/4 c  Lime juice
      3 tb Sugar
 
  Grate the sweet potatoes into pieces about 1 inch long and about 1/4
  inch thick.  Saute the sweet potatoes in the butter for 5 minutes.
  
  Add the tequila, lime juice and sugar, and cook covered, over moderate
  heat, for 5 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sweet potatoes sauteed in lime and tequila -- Rose's lime juice, a
  common brand, has a substantial amount of added sugar. Try to find
  lime juice without added sugar, or leave all the sugar out of the
  recipe if you can't find it. Naturally you will get the best results
  if you squeeze fresh limes to get the lime juice.
  
  : Difficulty:  trivial.
  : Time:  10 to 15 minutes, most of it spent grating the potatoes.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

  This dish is intended to be a simple statement using seasonal
  vegetables.
  
  Preparation:  Trim zucchini and mushrooms.  Slice zucchini in half
  lengthwise, then roll-cut or simply slice on bias in thick 2" long
  sections. Zucchini should be bite-size but not chunky. Cut mushrooms
  in half through the stem.  Wash, then finely mince Sichuan vegetable
  (this is the secret ingredient!). Rinse chilies; leave whole. Com-
  bine stock, soy sauce, sherry, bean sauce, sugar, and vinegar in

  Stir-frying:  Heat oil in very hot wok.  Just before oil smokes, add
  zucchini, mushrooms, Sichuan vegetable, garlic, and chilies; stir-fry
  for about 1 minute, tossing continuously so vegetables do not scorch.
  Add liquid ingredients; bring to boil; dribble in cornstarch paste to
  make a light sauce (it should not have a gravy look); then combine
  sauce well with vegetables.  Serve when zucchini is still slightly

           No Ingredients
 
  To saute, heat a film of oil or clarified butter in a saute pan until
  it smokes. (Clarified butter is heated until it separates and the
  solids skimmed off). Add a thin slice of boneless meat, dredged in
  flour, and cook just long enough to brown well on both sides. The
  meat must be thin enough and tender enough to cook to doneness in
  that amount of time. If it is thicker, it should be grilled, broiled,
  or pan-fried.

      Title: SAUT‚ING TECHNIQUES
 Categories: Info, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  While stir-frying cooks small pieces of seafood and vegetables over
  high heat with constant stirring, saut‚ing is done in a skillet over
  moderate heat with less activity. First you brown the fish on one
  side, then turn it over to finish cooking on the other ÄÄ an ideal
  way to cook larger or more delicate pieces of fish.
  
  The fish can be whole, cut into easy-to-handle fillets, or cut into
  small pieces. Very thin fillets are tricky to saut‚ because they
  become quite fragile as they cook; you might want to consider
  steaming them instead. To create a nice crisp coating when saut‚ing,
  first dust the fish lightly with flour, cornmeal, breadcrumbs or
  finely chopped nuts.
  
  Once the fish is cooked and has been transferred to warmed dinner
  plates, you can make sauce in a flash using the same skillet. Add a
  splash of lemon juice or white wine, some freshly chopped herbs
  and/or minced green onion, heat just until warmed and pour over the
  fish to serve. Or add a handful of chopped nuts to the skillet, toast
  over moderately high heat, and scatter over the fish.
  
  Because saut‚ing requires the use of fat (oil, butter, or margarine),
  you can't avoid the added calories, but a skillet with a nonstick
  surface keeps added fat to a minimum. If you are not using a nonstick
  pan, be sure that a thin layer of fat evenly covers the bottom of the
  pan. You may need more or less oil than called for in the recipe
  depending on the size of the pan.
  
                                  How to Saut‚
  
  1. If cooking the fish uncoated, pat dry with paper towels to remove
  excess moisture and avoid splattering during cooking. If coating the
  fish, lightly dust with the chosen coating and pat to remove the
  excess.
  
  2. Heat the oil or butter in a large skillet over medium heat, then
  add the fish. Take are that the fish fits evenly in the pan without
  overlapping. If necessary, cook the fish in batches or in two pans at
  one time. Cook the fish until nicely browned, then carefully turn.
  
  3. Continue cooking until well browned on both sides and opaque
  through the thickest part of the fish. Cooking time will depend on
  the thickness of the fish, but figure roughly 10 minutes total for
  each inch of thickness.
  
  4. Transfer the fish to warmed dinner plates and cover with foil to
  keep warm. Add sauce ingredients to the pan and bring to a boil.
  
  5. Arrange the fish on individual plates, spoon sauce over the fish
  and serve.

  halves and pat each half into an 8" diameter, 1/2" thick circle. Cut
  into wedges, place wedges on a baking sheet and bake 15 to 17
  minutes, until lightly browned.

      Title: SAVORY CHICKEN
 Categories: Mexican, Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Or 4 half chicken breasts,
           -boned and skinned,
           Cut into pieces
 
  Savory Chicken is so fast and so good you will just want to stand and
  eat it out of the pan.
  
  (Home Spice Blend: use approximately the measurements below for
  spices. For the spice blend, combine cumin, cayenne pepper, thyme,
  garlic and onion powders, salt and flour. Increase the spice amounts
  if you are cooking more than 2 1/2 pounds of chicken.)
  
  1  tsp cumin powder 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 1 tsp crushed thyme 1/2 tsp
  garlic powder 1/2 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp salt 1 Tbs flour 2 Tbs
  butter 1 or 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 or 2 jalapeno chiles, seeded,
  minced 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup light beer This recipe doubles easily but
  don't try to saute the chicken all at once. After the chicken is
  skinned and boned, rub it with your home spice blend.  If you get
  inspired, add another spice. Let the spiced chicken sit at room
  temperature for about 20 minutes.
  
  Using a heavy 12-inch skillet, heat the butter and oil and add 1 cup
  of the chicken pieces at a time.  Saute over medium heat until
  golden. Remove to a plate. Saute the rest of the chicken, adding more
  oil if necessary. When all the chicken is sauteed, drain off any
  excess oil. Put all the chicken pieces back in the pan, along with
  the chiles and garlic and add the beer. A great head of steam will
  rise up the the most wonderful aroma. Quickly now, clamp on the lid
  and turn the heat to low. Check every 5 minutes and turn the chicken
  in the reducing broth. Cook for about 15 to 18 minutes. If the broth
  cooks away toward the end of the cooking, just add a tablespoon more
  beer.  At the end you should be left with a nice thick glaze. Push
  the chicken around the beer glaze so it all gets coated. This is
  about the best taco meat you will ever encounter. Since tacos are
  filled with other things, the recipe above will serve 4 people unless
  you ate too much out of the pan.

      Title: SAVORY CHICKEN & RICE IN A LOTUS LEAF
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 lg Dried lotus leaves
      1 c  Long-grain rice
    3/4 c  Sweet glutinous rice (see
           -Note)
      2 c  Chicken stock
      3    Chinese sausages lop
           -cheong) *
      8    Chinese dried black
           -mushrooms **
      2 tb Small dried shrimp ***
      1    Whole chicken breast, boned
           -and skinned
      2 tb Soy sauce, plus more for
           -dipping
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 ts Asian sesame oil

MMMMM----------------------CHICKEN MARINADE---------------------------
    1/2 ts Grated ginger
      2 ts Soy sauce
      2 ts Dry vermouth or Shao Hsing
           -wine
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 ts Asian sesame oil
 
  * cut diagonally into 1-inch slices ** soaked in warm water until
  soft and pliable (about 30 minutes) *** soaked in warm water for 30
  minutes
  
  Foods wrapped in dried lotus leaves become infused with an exotic
  earthy flavor.  If lotus leaves are not available, you can wrap the
  rice filling in oiled parchment. Besides being an unusual appetizer,
  this dish can be served as a snack, for lunch, or as a light meal.
  Note that the first step must be done the night before. Because lotus
  leaves vary so much in size, eight packets may require anywhere from
  four to ten leaves. (Larger leaves can be split in half, smaller
  leaves may need to be overlapped.)
  
  1.  The night before, pour boiling water over the lotus leaves and
  let them soak for 1 hour.  Rinse and squeeze them dry. Mix the long-
  grain and glutinous rice together in a large bowl. Wash the rice
  under running cold water; gently stir and rub the grains between your
  fingers to loosen all the excess starch. Continue until the water
  runs clear. Drain thoroughly. Mix the rice with the chicken stock in
  a 2-quart saucepan; soak overnight in the refrigerator.
  
  2.  The next day, set the saucepan of rice uncovered over high heat;
  bring to a boil.  Stir just enough to loosen the rice grains. Reduce
  the heat to medium-high and boil until the liquid is absorbed, about
  8 to 10 minutes. Put the sausages on top of the rice and cover the
  pan. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes. Turn off the
  heat but do not remove the cover. Let the rice stand for 10 minutes,
  then, with a wet wooden spoon, transfer it to a large bowl; set aside.
  
  3.  Squeeze the mushrooms dry.  Cut off the stems at the base and
  discard them; cut the caps in half. Combine the marinade ingredients
  in a medium bowl. Cut the chicken breast into 3/4-inch chunks and
  toss it with the marinade.  Add the mushrooms and marinate for 20
  minutes. Drain and coarsely chop the shrimp.
  
  4.  In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, sugar, white pepper, and
  sesame oil; mix into the cooked rice. Add the chicken-mushroom
  mixture and the shrimp.
  
  5.  Fold a lotus leaf in half and put it on a cutting board. If the
  middle stem or edges are tough and hard, trim and discard them. (If
  the leaves are small, you may need to over- lap halves.) Divide the
  rice mixture into 8 portions; place one portion in the center of a
  leaf half. Fold the edges over the rice to make a 4-inch square
  packet. Tie it with twine. Repeat with the remaining leaves and rice.
  Arrange the packets in a single layer in a bamboo steaming basket.
  
  6.  Prepare a wok for steaming.  Steam the packets over medium-high
  heat for 20 minutes.  Remove them from the steamer and cut each
  packet across the top to expose its contents. Serve with small dishes
  of soy sauce for dipping.
  
  NOTE:  Sweet glutinous rice is also known as "sticky rice" because
  when it is cooked it becomes sticky.  It is used to make poultry
  stuffing and leaf-wrapped rice packages; it is called sweet rice
  because it is often used to make sweet dishes.  Soak it overnight
  before cooking for the best results.
  
  Makes 8 packets.

           Rich pastry crust
      2    Egg yolks, beaten
 
  This refined version of an old American classic has a rich, flaky,
  meaty-tasting crust, thanks to its mixture of lard and chicken fat.
  The latter is a handy byproduct of the precooking of the chicken the
  day before. Make sure the chicken fat is good and cold when making
  the crust.
  
  Season chicken parts to taste with salt and pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons
  butter and oil together in soup pot. Add chicken and brown. Add
  chicken broth, quartered onion, celery chunks and carrot chunks and
  bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is tender, 20-30
  minutes. Let cool. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Next day, skim cold chicken fat off top of broth. Reserve 1/4 cup fat

  This steamed egg dish exemplifies the simplicity of Chinese home
  cooking it takes about 5 minutes to prepare. The Chinese use a heat-
  proof porcelain shallow bowl 7 inches wide by 3 inches deep with
  sloping sides to steam this egg dish.  A 1 quart ceramic souffle dish

  pepper in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Remove from heat; cool
  completely.
  
  Lightly beat the eggs in bowl.  Slowly stir the cooled broth mixture
  into the eggs until thoroughly mixed. Avoid over-beating.
  
  Scatter the clams and 2 tablespoons of the chives in the bottom of a
  1quart heat-proof bowl.  Strain the egg mixture through a fine mesh
  sieve over the clams.
  
  Bring the water in a steamer to a boil over high heat. Place the bowl
  on a rack above the boiling water. Cover, reduce heat to a gentle
  boil, and steam for 2 minutes, or until the eggs begin to set.
  
  Carefully remove cover from steamer, and scatter the shrimp on top of
  the custard.  Cover and steam for 5 minutes longer, The custard is
  done when a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
  
  Carefully remove bowl from the steamer.  Drizzle with oyster sauce and
  garnish with remaining chives.  Spoon over rice. Serve hot.

  remaining flour to prevent dough from sticking to hands. Place dough
  in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and
  let rise in a warm place (85-degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour, or
  until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, and divide into 4 equal
  portions, shaping each portion into a ball (cover the remaining dough
  while working to prevent it from drying out). Roll 1 ball into a 15 x
  12-inch paper-thin rectangle on a baking sheet coated with cooking
  spray. Score the dough by making 2 lengthwise cuts and 5 crosswise
  cuts to form 18 crackers.  Prick entire surface liberally with a fork

  Reduce heat to low and simmer about 20 minutes until the rice is
  tender and the liquid is absorbed.  Remove cloves and black peppers
  (or be prepared to warn your guests to watch out for them while
  eating). While rice is cooking, wash and trim leeks.  Cut crosswise
  in 1/2" thick slices, using the tender parts of the green tops as
  well as the white. Separate into rings. Melt margarine in a wide
  frying pan.  Add leeks and shredded carrot and cook, stirring
  occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add peas, cashews and raisins and cook
  for 3 minutes. When rice is cooked, stir in leek mixture. Turn onto a
  serving platter and garnish with slices of 3 hard-cooked egg and
  parsley if desired. Per serving, including eggs (which I don't use):

      Title: SAVORY INDIAN PANCAKES
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -======================
           -(Makes 18 to 20 pancakes)
 
  Ingredients:
  
  2 cups     dry mung beans 3/4" cube of peeled, fresh ginger root.
  
  For every one cup of soaked beans, add:
  
  1/2 cup    water 1/2 tsp Spike or other vegetable-seasoned salt 1/2
  tsp asafetida or 1 clove garlic 1/4 tsp baking soda 1/8 tsp cayenne
  1/8 tsp black pepper Soak mung beans overnight to soften.  The next
  day, mung beans must be ground, so drain the beans to prepare for
  grinder. Grinding can be done in a food processor or a blender. If in
  a food processor, do the whole batch of beans and multply the other
  ingredients by 4. If in a blender, do 1 cup of beans at a time with
  the amount of the other ingredients as listed _per_batch_.  Whether
  in a blender or a food processsor, first drop chunk of ginger root in
  and allow it to get chopped up. Add soaked, drained mung beans and
  run machine till beans are fairly ground up (in a blender you can
  only do 1 cup at a time to avoid burning out the motor.) Add the next
  six ingredients and grind to a smooth, fluffy paste. The batter is
  now ready to be made into pancakes, which takes mastering a light
  touch on the spoon. Just remember  practice makes perfect.
  
  Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over a medium flame and pour 1/2
  to 1 teaspoon of oil into the skillet or griddle. With a spoon, mix
  batter thoroughly (batter must be mixed before each pancake is poured
  because it separates very quickly) and scoop out 1/3 to 1/2 cup of
  batter. Pour batter into the middle of the skillet and place the
  rounded bottom of a broad spoon very lightly in the center of the
  batter. Then use a slow, gentle and continuous spiral motion to
  spread the batter outward with the back of the soup spoon untill the
  pancake is about 7" to 8" in diameter. If batter is sticking to the
  spoon and making holes in the pancake as you spread, you are either
  pressing too hard or you didn't begin pressing soon enough and the
  batter was semi-cooked before you attempted to spread it. Just try to
  spread with the spoon immediately and lighten the touch.
  
  Cover and cook for 2 minutes, or till the pancake turns a
  reddish-brown color.  Remove cover and drizzle a tiny bit of oil over
  the pancake. Flip to cook on other side and cook uncovered till
  reddish spots begin appearing on the second side.  Continue cooking
  all the batter in the same way.
  
  Thesse are delicious served plain with side dishes of vetables,
  chutneys and yogurt; or you may want to stuff the pancake by placing
  filling inside and folding it over to form a turnover shape. This
  recipe makes 18 to 20 pancakes.

      Title: SAVORY KASHA STUFFING FOR POULTRY
 Categories: Poultry, Stuffing, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
      1 c  Buckwheat groats
      1    Egg (slightly beaten)
      2 c  Boiling water
      3    Strips bacon (cut in pieces)
      4 tb Butter
      1 md Onion (chopped)
      1    Clove garlic (minced)
    1/2    Green pepper (chopped)
    1/4 lb Mushrooms (chopped)
      1 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Sage
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
 
  Kasha is frequently called buckwheat groats.  It is made from
  buckwheat grain and then roasted, which gives it a delicious nut-like
  flavor. Aside from being a tasty stuffing for poultry, this recipe
  makes an excellent side dish in place of rice, potatoes, or noodles.
  So if you have any stuffing left over, be sure to refrigerate it and
  save for a future meal.
  
  Mix the groats with beaten egg, then add to frying pan over high
  heat. Stir constantly until grains separate. Now add the briskly
  boiling water, cover pan, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, fry bacon in another large frying pan. When bacon is
  lightly browned, push to one side and add butter. Let this sizzle and
  add onion, garlic , green pepper, and mushrooms. Stir well while they
  are cooking so that they do not become too brown.  Add oregano, sage,
  and salt and pepper. Reduce heat and add the cooked groats. Mix well,
  adjust seasoning, and remove from heat.
  
  This is enough for a small roast chicken and more than enough for 2
  Cornish game hens.  Increase ingredients for goose.

  They cook quickly and overcooking will toughen them. Drain and
  reserve the cooking liquid.
  
  Quarter the scallops if large. To the cooking liquid, add enough
  water to make 1-1/3 cups total.
  
  Melt butter in a double boiler. Add flour, stir, and blend. Add
  scallop liquid gradually, continuing to stir and cook over low heat.
  Add mayonnaise slowly, as soon as sauce thickens. Add scallops,
  thyme, and salt. Heat through but do not allow water-under to boil.
  Serve on toast or in toast cups.

      Title: SAVORY SCONES
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Scones
 
  2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
      4 ts Baking powder
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter cut into
           16 pieces
      1 c  Buttermilk
 
  1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 2. Combine flour, baking powder, salt
  and baking soda in food processor. Pulse once or twice to combine.
  Add butter. Pulse 10 to 12 times or until mixture resembles fresh
  bread crumbs. (You can use pastry blender to cut butter into flour if
  you don't have a food processor.) 3. Transfer mixture to large bowl.
  Add 1 cup buttermilk, stirring quickly to combine. If mixture is too
  dry, add more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough holds
  together and is slightly stringy and crumbly. Turn out onto lightly
  floured surface. Knead 6 to 7 times (do not knead more than that or
  scones will become tough). 4. Divide dough in half. With floured
  hands, press each half into 9x4-inch rectangle. With short side
  facing you, fold into thirds like a business letter. Press each
  portion into 6 to 7-inch circle; place on ungreased baking sheet. Cut
  each circle into 6 equal wedges; pull wedges slightly apart. Brush
  tops with remaining buttermilk. Let stand 10 minutes. 5. Bake in 400
  degree oven for 20 minutes, or until tops are lightly browned. Remove
  and serve warm.
  
  Ham and Sage Scones: Add 4 ounces cubed boiled ham and 1 teaspoon
  dried sage with butter. Pulse 10 to 12 times until ham pieces are no
  larger than grains of rice. Instead of pressing dough into circles,
  press each half into 7 1/2-inch square. Cut each into 8 squares.
  
  Cheddar Cheese Scones: Add 4 ounces cubed Cheddar and 1/4 to 1/2
  teaspoon cayenne pepper along with butter. Process 10 to 12 times
  until cheese pieces are no larger than dried peas. After brushing
  tops with buttermilk, sprinkle with sesame seeds, using about 2
  teaspoons total.
  
  Rosemary and Black Olive Scones: After dividing dough in half,
  scatter 1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried rosemary and 1/4 cup chopped
  kalamata olives (about 10 olives) over each batch of dough before it
  is folded into thirds.

      Title: SAVORY STUFFED ACORN OR BUTTERNUT SQUASH
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  1 ea specified ingredients (follows)
  
  Split and clean butternut or acorn squash. Cook face down on oiled
  pan in 350 F oven for about 30 mins or until tender.
  
  While doing that, assemble:
  
  Enough cooked wild rice for the number of squash to be stuffed. Some
  golden delicious apples, peeled and cubed. A mirepoix made from
  chopped onions, chopped celery and chopped carrots, saut‚ed in a
  little sesame oil. (At least one medium onion, one rib of celery and
  one small carrot per two persons; 1 tsp sesame oil and 1+ of canola
  oil.) A handful of dark raisins A few chopped pecans or walnuts A
  dash or two of ground cloves A splash of dry vermouth, sherry or
  madeira Enough frozen orange juice concentrate to moisten the above
  Some good toasted bread or muffin crumbs.
  
  Prepare the mirepoix by cooking onions in oil, adding carrots, and
  then adding celery. Chop the apples. If delayed, mix OJ concentrate
  with apples to prevent discoloration. Mix all ingredients. Season to
  taste. Stuff into squash, top with crumbs and return to 350 F oven
  until thoroughly hot to cook out the alcohol.
  
  Almost everything above is optional, but the magic is in the cloves,
  vermouth and OJ. The taste is savory sweet and the texture is slightly
  crunchy, both of which nicely complement the squash. Bon app‚tit!

      1 md Onion, coarsely chopped
      6 md Carrots, peeled, halved
           -lengthwise and cut into
           -1" pieces
      2 ts Chili powder
      2 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Dried marjoram or oregano
    1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
      2 lb Venison shoulder, cut into
           -1/2" cubes
      1 cn Italian plum tomatoes,
           -crushed (28 oz)
  1 1/2 c  Defatted chicken broth
           -(or beef broth)
    1/2 c  Red wine
    1/4 c  Tomato paste
      1 cn Dark-red kidney beans,
           -drained (16 oz)
      1 c  Baby lima beans
      3 c  Cooked rice or barley (opt)
 
  I like to start off this chili with bacon. Once it browns, use 2
  tablespoons of the bacon fat to wilt the vegetables - then one more
  tablespoon of the fat should be enough to brown the venison. Since
  the meat is lean, brown it quickly over high heat.
  
  1. Brown the bacon in a skillet over medium heat for about 10 minutes
  or until golden brown. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and set
  aside. Reserve 3 tablespoons of bacon fat; discard the rest.
  
  2. Place 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat in a casserole; add the onion
  and carrots, sprinkle with chili powder, cumin, marjoram and red
  pepper flakes, then cook for 5 minutes. Add the reserved bacon.
  
  3. Pour the remaining tablespoon of bacon fat back into the skillet.
  Brown the venison over medium-high heat in small batches and remove
  to the casserole with a slotted spoon. (The meat should brown
  quickly, so raise the heat to high if necessary.)
  
  4. Add the tomatoes, broth, wine and tomato paste. Bring to a simmer
  and cook, uncovered, for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce
  the heat if the chili begins to boil.
  
  5. Add the kidney beans and lima beans, then adjust the seasonings.
  Simmer 10 minutes longer or until meat is tender.
  
  6. Serve the chili hot in 6 bowls (over rice or barley, if desired).

      Title: SAVORY WILD RICE STUFFED ONIONS
 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 lg Vidalia Onions or 8 med
           -yellow onions.
      1 c  Mushrooms, chopped
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      1    Apple, peeled, cored,
           -chopped (about 1 cup)
      2 tb Fresh parsley, minced
      2 tb Fresh marjoram, minced (used
      1 ts Dried)
      1 ts Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Paprika
           -Salt & pepper to taste
      1 c  Wild rice, cooked
      1 x  Vegetable stock
 
  1. Preheat oven to 400F
  
  2. Cut 1/4 unch off both ends of the onion and peel off dry layers.
  Bake onions, root end down in baking dish for 30 minutes, or until
  golden brown. Let cool and hollow out each onion from top, leaving
  1/2 inch shell (outer most 2-4 layers).
  
  3. Chop 1 cup of reserved onion and saute with mushrooms in a medium
  hot pan for 3 minutes.  Add garlic and apple and saute 3 minutes. Add
  parsley, marjoram, lemon juice, paprika, salt and pepper; combine the
  sauteed mixture with the cooked rice.
  
  4. Fill each onion shell with rice mixture. Pour enough stock to cover
  bottom of onions (about 1/2 inch). Bake for 20 minutes, basting the
  stuffed onions with stock occasionally.
  
  Makes 6-8 servings depending on which onions you use.
  
  My suggestion on this is that the onions took A LOT longer to cook
  than 30 minutes.  If you want to fix this for a dinner, I recommend
  that you bake the onions the night before, and then finish up the
  next evening with the filling.  The onions will also be cool then,
  instead of working with hot onions that just came out of the oven.

  For elegance and drama, borrow the Sazerac tradition of serving
  colorful sorbets in a glistening swan ice sculpture. The ice mold,
  which is truly impressive, is easy to create with a soft-plastic mold
  filled with distilled water and frozen overnight. The next day,
  simply pull off the plastic. Info on ordering the mold included at
  end of recipe.
  
  DIRECTIONS: If using ice swan, prepare several days in advance. Fill
  mold with distilled water. Freeze until firm throughout. Remove from
  mold and return to freezer until ready to use.
  
  To make Lemon Sorbet, in 2 quart saucepan, heat water and sugar to
  boiling; boil mixture 5 minutes. Cool sugar mixture to room
  temperature. Stir in mineral water, lemon juice, and rind. Gently
  fold in egg white. Freeze according to Freezing Directions (below).
  
  To make Strawberry Sorbet, in 2 quart saucepan, heat sugar and water
  to boiling; boil mixture 5 minutes. Cool sugar mixture to room
  temperature. In food processor, with chopping blade, puree
  strawberries, a cup at a time. Strain juice and pulp into bowl;
  discard seeds. Stir strawberry puree and orange and lemon juices into
  sugar mixture. Freeze according to Freezing Directions (below).
  
  To make Blackberry Sorbet, in 2 quart saucepan, heat sugar and water
  to boiling; boil mixture 5 minutes. Cool sugar mixture to room
  temperature. In food processor, with chopping blade, puree
  blackberries, a cup at a time. Strain juice and pulp into bowl;
  discard seeds. Gently fold blackberry puree and egg whites into sugar
  mixture. Freeze according to Freezing Directions (below).
  
  Just before serving, place swan on cloth napkin lined serving platter
  and garnish with mint and flowers, if desired. Scoop sorbets into
  swan or a glass bowl and serve immediately.
  
  Freezing Directions: If using ice cream maker, freeze sorbet mixture
  following manufacturer's directions. If not using an ice cream maker,
  pour sorbet mixture into 13 by 9 inch baking pan; cover and freeze 6
  to 8 hours or until frozen. Remove sorbet from freezer; cut into 1
  inch squares and let stand at room temperature 20 minutes or until
  slightly softened. Meanwhile, chill large bowl and beaters of
  electric mixer. Place softened sorbet squares in chilled bowl. Beat
  on low speed until squares are broken up, then beat on high speed
  until smooth and fluffy- about 1 minute. Pack sorbet into a freezer
  container and freeze until ready to serve.
  
  Note: To obtain Swan Mold, call RMI-D, Ice Creations Unlimited at:
  (303) 373-5001 Ice molds are $37.00 plus shipping and handling (as of

           Coarse salt for the tops
 
  "These crunchy bread sticks are ideal companions to a hot soup or
  stew. 350~F.      35 to 45 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the yeast with the sugar and the warm water.
  Set aside in a warm place until the yeast starts to foam, about 5 to
  10 minutes.
  
  Measure the flour into a large bowl or the food processor. Stir in the
  yeast mixture, the oil, and the
      3/4    cup water. Mix well.
  
  Add the scallions. Knead by hand for about 5 minutes on a lightly
  floured surface or by pulsing about 10 to 15 times in the food
  processor. Knead until the scallions are thoroughly kneaded in and
  the dough is smooth and springy to the touch. Place the dough in a
  large, lightly oiled bowl and turn over to coat all sides. Cover with
  a damp cloth and set the dough in a warm place until it has doubled
  in bulk, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Punch the dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface or
  pastry cloth. Knead a few strokes. With a knife, cut the dough into
  12 to 16 equal pieces. With your hands, roll each piece into a stick
  approximately 12 inches long. You will have a more even-looking stick
  if you place the dough on a firm surface and roll your hands across
  the top, moving from the center outward.
  
  Place the sticks 1 inch apart on a baking sheet that has been lightly
  sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover the sheet with a damp towel and let the
  sticks rise slightly in a warm place for about 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Brush the tops of the sticks with the egg mixture and sprinkle with
  coarse salt. Bake 35 to 45 minutes, until lightly browned and crisp.
  Cool on a rack. Yield: 12 to 16.
  
  VARIATIONS: For cheese bread sticks, knead in 1/2 cup grated Parmesan
  cheese with or instead of the scallions.
  
  The Scallions may be omitted from this recipe to produce equally good
  plain bread sticks.

 Categories: Breads, Chinese, Vegetables
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 lb All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Coarse-grain sea salt
           -OR- kosher salt
      5    Scallions; coarsely chopped
      5 tb Vegetable oil (or more)
 
  Place the flour in a mixing bowl.  Sprinkle evenly with the baking
  powder and sugar.  Mix with a wooden spoon. Add the water gradually,
  stirring and mixing with the wooden spoon. Knead the dough for 3-4
  minutes. Cover it with a damp cloth and leave for half an hour, then
  knead again for 2-3 minutes.  Divide the dough into ten portions and
  form into narrow strips 8-10 inches long.  Flatten the strips with a
  rolling pin and ten bands of pancake thickness.  Sprinkle each band
  with salt and then with chopped scallions.  Roll the bands lengthwise
  into long double-thickness spaghetti-shaped strips.  Hold one end of
  the strip and turn the other end around in circles until the
  concentric rings form themselves around the center into a spiral
  pancake. Flatten the pancake with the palm of the hand.  Repeat until
  the dough has been made into ten spiral pancakes.
  
  Heat the oil on the bottom of a large flat-bottomed frying pan. When
  hot, lift the handle of the frying pan so that the surface of the pan
  is evenly greased. Place the spiral pancakes on the surface of the
  pan. Fry over low heat for 2-1/2 to 3 minutes and turn the pancakes
  over. Repeat and fry gently until the pancakes are evenly browned on
  both sides.

      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 c  Unbleached flour, plus
           -additional flour for
           -kneading
    3/4 c  Cold water
      2 tb Lard, softened
    1/4 c  Minced scallion, with tops *
      2 md Cloves garlic, minced
           Salt
      4 tb Peanut oil
 
  Makes 2  10 inch cakes
  
  Place 2 cups flour in medium bowl; add 3/4 cup water in thin steady
  stream, stirring constantly until mixture forms rough dough. Turn out
  onto lightly floured surface; knead, adding flour as necessary to
  prevent sticking, until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
  Allow dough to rest under kitchen towel 15 minutes.
  
  Divide dough in half; keeping one half covered, roll other half out
  on a lightly floured surface to 10 x 6 rectangle, long side facing
  you. Spread rectangle with 1 Tbsp. of the lard. Sprinkle with 2 Tbsp.
  of the scallion, half the garlic, and salt to taste.  Roll rectangle
  toward you into tight cylinder, jelly-roll fashion: pinch seams and
  ends to seal. Repeat with other piece of dough.  Shape each roll into
  a coil; fasten end to coil by pinching.  Refrigerate, wrapped in
  plastic, 30 minutes.
  
  Remove coils from refrigerator; using hands, roughly shape one coil
  into ball.  Roll out on generously floured surface to circle 10
  inches in diameter and about 1/4 inch thick; avoid rolling over edges
  of dough. Brush off excess flour.  Repeat with other dough.
  
  Heat 2 Tbsp. of the oil in large heavy skillet over medium-high heat
  until fragrant.  Add on cake; immediately reduce heat to medium. Fry
  cake, shaking pan occasionally, until underside is golden brown,
  about 3 minutes. Turn cake over; fry until second side is golden
  brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to paper toweling to drain. Wipe
  skillet clean; add remaining oil and fry second pancake.  Cakes can
  be served either warm or at room temperature.
  
  * 1 Tbsp. minced fresh coriander leaves can be added to the scallion.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour, + about 1/4 cup for
           -kneading
      1 ts Sugar
    2/3 c  Boiling water
    1/4    To 1/3 cup cold water
      2 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Kosher salt
    1/2 c  Finely minced scallions
    1/2 c  Peanut oil
 
  A dough is made, a cylinder is formed, the cylinder is shaped into a
  coil, which is then flattened and fried. The result is the most
  sensational fried bread you may ever taste. It's a favorite street
  snack in china.
  
  In a large bowl, combine the 2 cups flour and the sugar. Stir in the
  boiling water, and mix with chopsticks just until water is absorbed.
  Gradually stir in enough cold water so that a dough forms and pulls
  away from the sides of the bowl and is no longer sticky. Turn the
  dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 3-5 minutes,
  or until smooth and elastic.  Cover loosely with a dampened cloth and
  let rest for 1 hour. Redust surface with flour and knead dough again
  for several minutes, or until smooth. Divide dough into 4 equal
  pieces, and cover with dampened cloth.  Using a floured rolling pin,
  roll one piece of dough into a 6-7 inch round.  Lightly brush with
  sesame oil. Evenly scatter some salt and scallions on the round, then
  roll up into a tight cylinder. Coil cylinder around itself into a
  spiral, and pinch the end under into the dough. Repeat with the
  remaining dough pieces. Cover coils with a dampened cloth and let
  rest 15-20 minutes.  Using a floured rolling pin, roll the coiled
  dough on a floured surface into 6-7 inch rounds. heat the peanut oil
  in a wok or heavy skillet over medium high heat to 375F. Carefully
  add a pancake and fry 1-2 minutes per side, or until golden. As each
  pancake fries, press the center lightly with a metal spatula to
  insure that it is cooked. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels
  to drain. Repeat with remaining pancakes. Cut each pancake into 6-8
  wedges. Serve immediately. Serves 4-6 as part of a multi-course meal.

 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Cold cooked salmon or trout
           - (sea or river trout)
    1/2 lb Florentine fennel
           - (trimmed weight)
    1/2 lb Steaky bacon
      2 oz Butter
  1 1/2 oz Flour
    1/2 pt Whole milk
    1/4 pt Fish stock
           Lemon juice
           Dijon mustard
           Toasted or fried breadcrumbs
 
  Serves 8 as an appetizer, or 3-4 as a main course.
  
  Trim the fennel in the usual way, scraping away fibrous threads with a
  potato peeler, or remove and discard the outer layers if they are
  tired-looking or tough. Chop the flesh into small chunks and toss in
  1/2 oz melted butter.  Half cover the pan and leave to cook gently
  for 10 minutes just shaking the pan occasionally. Add the bacon, cut
  into snippets, increase heat and cook, stirring frequently, for
  several minutes until the bacon is cooked and the fennel is steaked
  with gold. Season with a good squeeze of lemon and plenty of pepper,
  and set aside to cool before mixing with the fish, which should be
  broken into large chunks.
  
  Make a sauce with 1-1/2 oz each butter and flour, the milk and the
  stock, and simmer gently, half covered, for about 10 minutes. Away
  from the heat, season with scant 1 teaspoon mustard, a little salt
  and plenty of pepper. Gently fold in the fish mixture and divide
  between 8 small scallop shells or cocottes or put it all into one
  large gratin dish. Cover with foil and reheat in the oven straight
  away, or if preparing ahead, set aside in a cool place until close to
  serving time. If the mixture is cold when it goes into the oven, it
  will probably need 25 minutes or so at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7 to
  become thoroughly heated through. Stand the dish(es) on a pre-heated
  baking sheet to help speed things up. When thoroughly hot, remove the
  foil and sprinkle the fish mixture generously with freshly toasted or
  fried breadcrumbs immediately before serving.

      Title: SCALLOPS & CASHEWS IN TANGERINE SAUCE
 Categories: Main dish, Seafood, California, Chopstix
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------SCALLOPS-------------------------------
      2 c  Raw cashews
      2 c  Cooking oil (WHAT!? -KM)
      4    Green onions; finely minced
      4    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 lb Bay scallops

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/4 c  Dry sherry
      3 tb Tomato sauce
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Oriental sesame oil
      1 ts Red wine vinegar
      2 ts Chinese chili sauce
      2 ts Grated tangerine peel
           -(OR finely minced instead)

MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
      1 tb Cornstarch
 
  This recipe can be adapted beautifully to be vegetarian! I love this
  dish with cubed tofu instead of scallops, and if you can't find a
  vegetarian oyster sauce, just substitute a bit of soy sauce or
  experiment with your favorite Asian sauce.  -KM
  
  ADVANCE PREPARATION:  Place the nuts and oil in a small saucepan over
  medium-high heat.  Stir the nuts occasionally and when they turn very
  light golden, drain immediately and pat dry on paper towels. Pour off
  and reserve 2 tablespoons of the cooking oil for stir-frying.
  
  Set aside in separate containers the green onions, garlic, and
  scallops. In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients and mix well.
  
  LAST-MINUTE COOKING:  Combine the cornstarch with an equal amount of
  cold water.  Set aside.
  
  Place a wok over highest heat.  Whent the wok is very hot, add the
  reserved oil to the center.  Roll the oil around the sides of wok and
  add the garlic.  When it just begins to turn white, in about 15
  seconds, add the scallops.  Stir-fry until the scallops just lose
  their raw outside color, about 1 minute.
  
  Stir in the green onions and pour in the sauce.  When the sauce comes
  to a low boil, stir in a little of the cornstarch mixture so that
  sauce glazes the scallops. Stir in the cashews, then taset and adjust
  the seasonings. Spoon onto a heated platter or individual plates.
  Serve at once.

  1 1/2 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
    3/4 lb Mushrooms; sliced
      1    Small green pepper; sliced
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/2 ts Salt

      1 c  Diced Swiss cheese
    1/2 c  Grated Romano cheese
      1 c  Heavy cream, whipped
      2 tb Butter for topping
           Paprika
 
  Bring wine and lemon juice to boil and add scallops, mushrooms, and
  green pepper. Simmer just until scallops are tender. Be careful not to
  overcook!!! Drain, reserving liquid. Melt butter in saucepan,
  blending in salt, pepper, and flour until bubbly. Gradually stir in
  reserved liquid and cook until thickened. Add Swiss cheese and 1/2 of
  the Romano and stir over very low heat until blended. Remove from
  heat and fold in whipped cream. Stir in scallop mixture, then divide
  between eight, individual, buttered scallop shells/baking dishes.
  Sprinkle tops with remaining Romano, dot with butter and sprinkle
  with pap- rika. Broil until golden brown. Watch them carefully so as
  not to burn!!!! This, as you may guess, is sinfully rich and
  deliciously bad for you. Scallops themselves, however, are very low
  in cholesterol. If you would also like to try some plainer, New
  England-style scallop recipes, just let me know. Yours in good food

      Title: SCALLOPS ST.JACQUES~ A LA PROVENCAL
 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Finely chopped yellow onion
      2 tb Finely chopped green onion
      2 ts Finely chopped garlic
      1 c  Flour
           Salt and pepper
  1 1/2 lb Scallops, cut into 1/4-inch
           -slices
    2/3 c  Dry white wine
    1/4 ts Thyme
      1    Bay leaf
    1/3 c  Grated Swiss cheese
 
  "...For those who love a harmony of softly blended flavors with the
  faint suggestion of seafood..."
  
  Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a skill over medium heat. Add the
  onions, green onions and garlic. Cook, stirring often, for about 5
  minutes, or until the onions are tender but not browned. Using a
  slotted spoon, remove the onions and garlic and set aside.
  
  Put the flour, salt and pepper on a large piece of waxed paper, and
  stir with a fork to mix well.
  
  Dip the scallop slices into the flour mixture and coat well. Shake off
  excess flour.
  
  Melt 2 tablespoons of the remaining butter in the skillet and quickly
  saute the scallops in it until they are lightly browned. Lower the
  heat and add the wine, thyme, bay leaf and onion mixture. Cover and
  simmer for 5 minutes.
  
  Remove the scallops with a slotted spoon and spread them in a layer
  in a shallow baking dish.  (I use a 10-inch pie plate, but you may
  use 4 large scallop shells, if you prefer).
  
  Briskly boil the scallop cooking liquid for about 1 minute to reduce
  and thicken it.  Pour the sauce over the scallops. (This may be made
  early in the day and covered and refrigerated until just before
  serving.) About 3 minutes before serving, sprinkle the cheese over
  the scallops, dot with remaining butter, and run under the broiler
  just long enough to melt the cheese and lightly brown it. Serve hot.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: SCALLOPS W/ PINE NUTS & DRIED TOMATO
 Categories: Seafood, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 lb Bay scallops (nickel-sized)
           -=OR=- large sea scallops,
           -(half-dollar sized),
           - cut in half
      4 tb Pine nuts
      1 tb Finely minced shallots
      1 ts Finely minced garlic
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
    1/2 c  Dried tomatoes
      6 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Finely chopped parsley
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Baked potatoes are perfect with these scallops, but don't serve them
  with sour cream, which will interfere with the sauce. IF THE DRIED
  TOMATOES are packed in oil, drain and pat them dry on a towel. Heat
  the oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil is almost
  smoking, toss in the scallops and cook for 30 seconds without
  stirring. Stir with a wooden spoon and let cook another minute. Using
  a slotted spoon, remove the scallops to a plate. They should be only
  partially cooked. Discard the fat from the skillet. Return the
  skillet to high heat, add the shallots, garlic, wine, lemon juice and
  dried tomatoes. Boil, reducing wine by half. Meanwhile, the scallops
  will have released a certain amount of liquid. Pour this into the pan
  and reduce until thick. Return the scallops and add the pine nuts to
  the pan, reduce the heat to low, whisk in the butter and add the
  chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Pour onto a serving platter.

      2    Garlic cloves - chopped
      2 tb Capers
 
   Place scaloppine between 2 pieces of waxed paper and pound until
  thin. When pounding meat do not use a straight up-and-down movement.
  Use a sliding action so meat is stretched more than flattened (I use
  the edge of a saucer for this).  Coat meat lightly with flour.
  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Melt 3 tablespoons butter with oil in
  a large heavy skillet. When butter foams, add veal. Cook over high
  heat about 1 minute on each side. Veal should be light golden outside
  and pink inside.
   Place veal on a warm platter.  Add 1 tablespoon butter and lemon
  juice to skillet.  Deglaze skillet by stirring to disolve meat juices
  attached to bottom of skillet. Stir in parsley, garlic and capers.
  Taste and adjust sauce for seasoning, then spoon over veal. Serve

  Vittorio's restaurant in the Rice Village, owned by Victor Assandri,
  was on of the first restaurants to expose Houston to the wonderful
  regional dishes of Northern Italy in the late '60's and early '70's.
  The secrets to success with this succulent shrimp dish are using
  fresh ingredients, especially shrimp, parsley and lemon juice, and
  not over cooking the shrimp.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
  shrimp, garlic and parsley and saute until shrimp turn pink, about 2
  minutes. Turn shrimp and season with salt and pepper. Stir in lemon
  juice and wine and simmer about 2 minutes more. Don't over cook or
  shrimp will be rubbery. Makes 4 servings.

      Title: SCANDINAVIAN HARDTACK
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Rye flour
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat or all-purpose
           Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 c  Plain yogurt
 
  "The yogurt lends an initial tartness, but the aftertaste is mellow
  and full of rye flavor. This simple cracker is good with peach jam.
  300~F. 30 to 35 minutes Preheat oven to 300~F.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flours, salt,
  and sugar.
  
  Add the oil and blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the
  yogurt and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
  ball. The dough should be quite stiff. Divide into 4 equal portions
  for rolling.
  
  On a floured surface, roll these out, one at a time, into large
  circles. Roll as thin as possible, about 1/16 inch, so that each is
  approximately 12 inches in diameter. Prick all over with a fork,
  making certain to push all the way through the dough.
  
  Place on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Turn the
  circles over and continue baking for another 15 to 20 minutes, or
  until crisp and completely dried throughout. Watch carefully and
  remove the hardtack the moment it starts to brown. Browning adversely
  affects the flavor of these crackers. Cool on a rack.
  
  VARIATION: All rye flour can be used instead of the wheat-rye
  combination.

  until the onions are soft, about 10 minutes. Combine the potatoes and
  the onion mixture, tossing to mix. Pour the mixture into a large
  shallow baking dish. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the top.  In a

  Pour this mixture over the potatoes; it will still be a little lumpy,

           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 c  White wine
      3    Cloves garlic, Crushed
      2    Birdseye chillies
      3 tb Mint
 
  Just about every cuisine of Europe has a recipe for oily fish steeped
  in vinegar or lemon and served cold. In Spain it is escabeche. The
  English have soused herrings. In southern Italy, they make scapice.
  
  Remove the heads and gut 1 kg fresh anchovies. Wash them and set
  aside on kitchen paper to dry.
  
  When they are dry, heat oil for deep-frying. Put 3 table- spoons plain
  flour in a paper or plastic bag and add salt and pepper. In batches,
  put the anchovies into the bag and shake until they are coated with
  seasoned flour. Shake off excess flour, then deep-fry. Drain the
  cooked anchovies and lay them in a large shallow pan.
  
  In a saucepan heat a cup of white wine vinegar with 3 cloves of garlic
  crushed, 2 birdseye chillies halved lengthways and 3 tablespoons mint,
  finely chopped. When the mixture comes to the boil, spoon it over the
  fish. Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, turning
  the fish midway.
  
  Serve as an antipasto with crusty bread.

           Greens
 
  Similar to 'Einlaufsuppe' ('Pour-In Soup').
  
  Combine the first four ingredients in a a small beaker-like pot and
  stir until smooth.  (The batter should drip in a long thin thread off
  the spoon). Tilt the pot and scrape the batter off the edge into the
  boiling broth.  This results in the elongated 'Schletterle' which are
  sort of halfway between spaetzle and noodles.
  
  Bring to a second boil, and adjust seasoning (salt, nutmeg, pepper,
  and greens).  Serve.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: SCHMARRN
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -========
 
  Ingredients: 3 large eggs 1/4 cup milk (actually, a 1/3 cup might be
  better) 1/4 cup  flour salt & pepper to taste. Maple Syrup to drown
  Wisk (with wire wisk) all ingredience (starting with eggs) together
  until very smooth (no lumps).  The mixture should have the
  consistency of heavy cream.
  
  Add about a table spoon each of butter/oil to a largish fry pan and
  let melt/heat up.  About medium/high. If you don't have a large fry
  pan you may have to make two batches.  By large, I mean about 10-12
  inches across.
  
  Here is where it gets hard to describe...
  
  Pour mixture in all at once.  As the sides start to set, push the set
  parts into the center so that more of the liquid pours into the
  "canal" and has a chance to set also. Cut/Push "openings" into the
  batter to expose pan surface and swish the liguid into that so it can
  set. etc....
  
  When most of it has set and there is only a very little liquid left
  (it should still be a "whole" piece the size of the pan at this
  point) I cut it into four and flip each section over. I then wait a
  few seconds and then start cutting up everything so that it resembles
  scrambled eggs. The goal is to have small, thick (1/4 inch?), bite
  sized pieces when you're done. (The best tool for this is a stiff
  spatula/egg flipper :-)
  
  After its cut up, stir and cook it for a while.  Don't be afraid of
  over cooking it.  I never have so far. You want it "browned"
  somewhat. I eat it with maple surrup poured over top but have had it
  with jam mixed in. Anything sweet would do, I imagine.

      2 tb Hot water (approx)
 
  roll out the pastry to a rectangle 14x18in. (45x35cm) and brush with
  the fat. For the Filling: mix together the filling ingrediants and
  distribute evenly over the pastry. Starting from the shorter side,
  roll up like a swiss roll. Then use a sharp knofe to cut off slices
  about 1 1/4 in thick. Lay these on a greased baking sheet and flatten
  slightly. OVEN: preheat overn for 5 min at very hot (400) BAKING
  TIME: 15-20 minutes. For the icing: sieve the icing sugar (powdered
  sugar) and blend with as much of the water as will five a good
  coating consistency. Ice the schnecken while still hot.
  
  *I know of no substitute for the vanillin sugar, you might want to
  check gourmet shops or specialty shops. or possibly a custard mix
  might work.

      Title: SCHNEIDERFLECKLESUPPE
 Categories: Soups/stews, Pasta, German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Egg
      1 tb Water
           Salt
    200 g  Flour (1 3/4 cups)
           Meat broth
           Ground nutmeg
           Chives
 
  On a pastry board, combine the flour, egg, water and salt into a pasta
  dough, then roll it out paper thin. Hang the dough over the back of a
  chair or something similar for drying. After the dough has been
  drying for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, cut it into 2/3-inch squares. As you
  spread out the dough on the board, you will have to keep dusting it
  with flour. Bring some lightly salted water to a boil and cook the
  'Fleckle' for about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain, briefly rinse in cold
  water, and then add to the hot meat broth. Adjust soup's seasoning,
  and top with chopped chives.
  
  Variation:  RIEBELESUPPE
  
  Prepare a dough as for the 'Schneiderflecklesuppe', but make it a bit
  firmer so you will be able to grate it onto the board. Cook 'Riebele'
  for a few minutes in salted water, then strain and add to hot meat
  broth.
  
  Serves 4.

  and stewed apples.
  
  To prepare, add apples and their liquid to ham and boil for one hour.
  If dried apples are used, they should be soaked overnight first. Add
  brown sugar. Prepare dumplings by sifting together flour, baking
  powder, salt and pepper. Stir in well-beaten egg, butter and enough
  milk to make a stiff but moist batter. Drop batter by large spoonfuls
  into main dish, cover tightly and steam for about 20 minutes. Frozen

           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper to taste
           Flour for dredging

      1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
      4 tb Butter or margarine
      1 tb Capers
           Lemon wedges
 
  Pound the cutlets until thin.  Sprinkle lightly on both sides with
  salt and pepper.  Dredge them lightly but thoroughly in flour.
  
  Beat the egg lightly with the water and dip the floured cutlets in the
  mixture; coat with crumbs. Using the side of a kitchen knife, tap the
  cutlets lightly so the crumbs will adhere well to the meat. Transfer
  them to a wire rack.  Refrigerate for one or two hours. This will
  help the breading adhere to the cutlets when they are being cooked.
  
  Heat the butter in a large skillet and, when it is hot but not brown
  or smoking, saute the cutlets in it until they are golden brown on
  both sides.
  
  Arrange the cutlets on a heated serving platter and garnish with the
  capers and lemon wedges.  Serve immediately.
  
  Serves four.

  on an ungreased griddle over medium heat. As one side becomes brown,
  turn and brown the other side, then turn each scone slightly on edge
  and place on side of griddle to the "fire". Turn until all edges are
  slightly browned. The firing will cook the scones through from all
  sides so there will be no raw dough in the center. Split and serve

    1/2 c  Buttermilk or Milk

      1    Egg;Lg, Beaten
 
  *    The butter, 3 sticks, should be cut into small pieces.
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++ +++
  
  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the butter, 3 3/4 c flour, and
  1/4 ts of salt.  With your fingers, work the ingredients together
  until you form small granules that are fairly uniform in size.
  Sprinkle 8 tb of the ice water over the granules and continue mixing
  until you can gather the ingredients into a ball. If the dough
  crumbles, add additional ice water, 1 tb at a time, until a soft ball
  can be formed. With the flat of your hand, press the dough into a
  thick cake, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1
  hour.  Prepare the filling by sifting the 3 1/2 cups of flour, the
  sugar, baking powder, spices, and remaining 1/4 ts of salt into a
  large bowl. Add the freshly ground black pepper, seedless and white
  or golden raisins, ground and coarsely chopped almonds. Mix
  thoroughly until all the fruits and nuts are coated well with the dry
  ingredients. Add the 3 eggs, milk, and brandy mixing well. Preheat
  the oven to 375 degrees F. and, on a lightly floured surface, roll
  two-thirds of the chilled pastry to a thickness of 1/4-inch.  Gently
  place a 9 X 3 1/2-inch springform pan on the pastry. With a small
  sharp knife,cut along the outside of the pan to make a disk.  Line
  the bottom of the pan with the disk of pastry. Use the remaining
  pieces of rolled-out pasty to line the sides of the pan, slightly
  overlapping the pastry on the bottom and letting the pastry extend
  about 1/2-inch above the top of the form. Spoon the filling into the
  pan, packing it down firmly and press the excess pastry over the
  filling. Brush the pastry with a little of the beaten egg. In the
  same fashion, roll out the remaining pastry into a circle larger than
  the form. Roll the pastry around the rolling pin to lift it and
  unroll it on the top of the form. Press the top pastry against the
  filling and the pastry below to make a tight seal and trim off the
  excess. Brush the entire top with the beaten egg. Cut a 1-inch round
  vent in the middle of the bun, and if you like, use the pastry scraps
  to make leaves. Roll the scraps together and cut out tear drop shapes
  to resemble leaves. Score the top, with a small sharp knife, to
  resemble the ribs of the leaves. Brush the undersides of the leaves
  with the remaining beaten egg to make them adhere to the top of the
  bun. Then brush the top again with the beaten egg. Bake on a rack in
  the middle of the oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the pastry is a
  rich golden brown. If the decorations color much faster than the top
  sheath of pasty, cover them with aluminum foil to reflect the oven
  heat and retard the browning.

      1 ts Bicarbonate of soda
  1 1/2 ts Cream of tartare
      1 oz Caster sugar
      1    Egg
    1/4 pt Milk or cream
 
  Sift the flour with the raising agents and stir in the sugar. Make a
  well in the centre and break the egg into it. Whisk the milk into the
  egg, then gradually incorporate the dry ingredients to make a very
  smooth, thick batter.  Alternately, simply mix everything together in
  a food processor. If time permits let the batter stand for 30 minutes
  before cooking.
      Heat a griddle, bakestone or cast-iron frying pan until very hot
  ~ or cook direct on the hot plate of an Aga. Grease your chosen
  surface lightly with buttered paper, using just enough fat to prevent
  the pancakes from sticking.  Using a large metal spoon held point
  downward, drop a few small rounds of batter on to the hot surface.
  Space them well apart. Cook over steady heat until bubbles rise to
  the surface and the underside of the pancakes are browned - about 2
  minutes. Loosen them gently with a palette knife, then flip them over
  and cook for about 1 minute longer. Makes about 16 pancakes. Source:

      Title: SCOTS TABLETS
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        2 lb sugar
        3 c  cream
  
  Put into an enamelled saucepan two pounds of granulated sugar and
  three teacupfuls of thin cream or milk. Bring it gradually to the
  boiling-point, stirring all the time.  Let it boil a few minutes.
  Test as for toffee, but do not boil it so high.  When it has reached
  the consistency of soft putty when dropped in wold water (about 245
  F.), remove the pan from the fire. Add flavorings as below.  Now put
  the pan into a basin of cold water and stir rapidly with a spoon. It
  soon begins to solidify round the edge, and this must be scraped off
  repeatedly. Keep stirring until the mass is sufficiently grained, and
  then pour it immediately on to a buttered slab. If too highly
  grained, it will not pour out flat; if too thin, it will be sticky.
  Only practice makes perfection. When sufficiently firm, mark into
  bars with a knife, or cut into rounds with the lid of a circular tin.
  Flavorings: Cinnamon.  Add a few drops of oil of cinnamon Coco-nut.
  Add four ounces of coco-nut and boil for two minutes, then add a
  pinch of cream of tartar and remove from the fire. It should be
  vigorously stirred till quite creamy. Fig. Add a pinch of cream of
  tartar just before removing from the fire. Then stir in four ounces
  of finely chopped figs, previously washed and dried. Ginger. Add Two
  teaspoonfuls of ground ginger, dissolved in a little cold water, and
  (if liked) some chopped preserved ginger. Lemon.  Add a small
  teaspoonful of essense of lemon Orange. Add the grated rind and juice
  of an orange Peppermint. Add a few drops of oil of peppermint
  Vanilla.  Add a small tsp. of essence of vanilla. Walnut. Add half a
  tsp. of essence of vanilla, and four ounces of shelled and chopped
  walnuts.

 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Cooked basmati rice
        x  Onions
        x  Frozen spinach
        x  1 can creamed corn
        x  Curry
 
  Sautee onions in a pan (use broth, vinegar, or Pam). When soft, add
  frozen block of chopped spinach (if you were clever enough to thaw
  it, so much the better). Stir for a minute. Put in pyrex pan (yes,
  these recipes are brought to you by Pyrex, makers of fine bakeware.
  Back over to you, Alex). Dump one can of creamed corn on it. No,
  creamed corn doesn't have any cream, it is just blended.  Douse
  liberally in curry! Get good curry bulk from an Indian/Oriental
  market and avoide the McCormick's stuff which is 44$/lb. Bake the
  onions, spinach, and creamed corn (with curry!) for 20 minutes on 350
  or so. Serve over basamati rice or just eat out of the pan.
  
  Let me know what you all think!  (and, I know that I have a sentence
  in there that reads "I..always be disappointed.." Yes, I know better,
  this was hurriedly typed in before a meeting, so you can all go home
  tonight and make that spinach curry dish.  I will be enjoying it,
  too).

    1/2 ts Gypsum
    3/4 ts -Salt
      2 oz Bittering hops; Fuggle or
           -Willamette; 57 grams
      1 oz Aromatic hops; Northern
           -Brewer dry hops ; 28 g
           -Water to 5 US gallons
           -or 19 litres water
    3/4 c  Corn sugar; for primimg
    1/2 oz Ale yeast; 14 grams
 
  Starting Specific Gravity: 1.047 Final Specific Gravity: 1.015
  Alcohol by vol 5%
  
  If your recipe contains Munich or Crystal Malt, place the cracked or
  ground grain in a kitchen pan, cover with water, heat to
  approximately 150F (66 C), cover & let stand (either on the stove top
  or in the oven) 45 minutes to 1 hour before you're actually ready to
  start to work. Place a colander over your boiling kettle (pot) & pour
  in the grain, letting the water collect in the pot below. Rinse
  through the grain with hot water, at least 130 degrees F (54 C) but
  no hotter than 170F (77 C) until a clear runoff is obtained. Discard
  the grain. The liquid becomes part of the boil. Thoroughly dissolve
  the following; Dry Malt, any sugar EXCEPT the priming sugar (used for
  bottling), Dextrin Powder, Gypsum and Salt in two or more gallons of
  water (as much as possible). Heat to a rolling boil. Stir in the
  Bittering Hops along with the Chocolate Malt and boil 30 minutes
  more, adding Aromatic Hops during the last two minutes. (If you are
  using hop pellets, you may 'dry hop', adding the pellets to the
  fermenter just proir to fermentation instead of putting them in the
  boiling kettle.) At the end of the boil, the wort should be cooled as
  quickly as possible to a temperature between 70 and 85 degrees F
  (21-27 C), so the yeast can be added.(If you wish measure starting
  specific gravity) Fermentation: Siphon your cooled wort into one or
  more sanitized glass jugs (or fermentors), filling no more than 2/3
  full. (Anne's note the total amount of liquid should be 5 American
  gallons.) Add the yeast, attach a airlock to each container and allow
  fermentation to proceed. In 5 to 7 days, when apparent yeast activity
  has ceased and it taste like dry, flat beer, you are ready to bottle.
  Siphon beer carefully into secondary container, do not disturb
  sediment. (Anne's note: if this is done TWICE, the second time a day
  or so later, there will be almost no sediment in the beer.) Boil
  priming sugar and stir in carefully. Siphon primed beer into clean
  bottles and cap (allow some headspace.) Check ales after week or two.
  (We've found that they are most drinkable after 3 weeks.) MAKES: 5 US
  gallons

      Title: SCOTTISH EGGS
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Sausage meat
      7    Eggs
      2 tb Finely chopped or grated
           -onion
      1 ts Poultry seasoning or sage
      1 ts Cumin
      1 ts Water
           Flour for coating purposes
           Fine, dry breadcrumbs
    1/2    Dz Kokanee beer
 
  First, you shoot a bear and have part of the meat made into sausage.
  If you're one of those unfortunates who doesn't hunt, I suppose you'd
  use pork sausage meat instead.
  
  To begin, crack a Kokanee, pour it into a frosted mug and quaff it
  while six of the eggs are hard boiling. When they're done, put them
  to one side and mix the meat, onion, and spice mixture together. Take
  the resulting mixture and coat the eggs with it carefully and evenly.
  You might even want to peel the shells off first - although they do
  add an interesting texture.
  
  When the eggs are done, roll them in the flour, shake off the excess,
  and put the eggs in the fridge for about an hour so the meat sets up.
  While you're waiting, you might as well crack another Kokanee and put
  your feet up; no sense straining yourself.
  
  A couple of minutes before the hours up, lightly beat the remaining
  egg with the tsp. of water.  Again, you might want to remove the
  shell... Take the eggs, dip them in the egg mixture, and roll them in
  the breadcrumbs; they are now ready for cooking.
  
  Traditionally, Scotch Eggs are deep fried.  You can do that if you
  wish, but who needs all the extra grease in their diet and the mess
  and smell? I suggest you bake them in the oven at 375 F. for about 20
  minutes or until the sausage covering is firm when picked at with a
  knife or fork. I usually stick them on a wire rack with a pan
  underneath so that they don't sit and cook in any grease that renders
  out of the sausage.
  
  Once done take a buddy, yourself, the Scotch Eggs, and the remaining
  Kokanee into the living room.  Watch Hockey Night in Canada as the
  Vancouver Canucks beat some godless team from the east while drinking
  Kokanee and munching the Eggs (you that is, not the Canucks) - no
  life like it.
  
  These go well with Lowenserf Hot German mustard or Louisiana Hot
  Sauce. Best way to serve them is with a chilled Spinach and Bacon
  salad and fresh tomatoes. Enjoy!

 Categories: Appetizers, Breakfast, Meats, Eggs
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
  4 lg Eggs                                     plain flour 8 oz
  Sausage meat 1 sm Egg, beaten 2 Spring onions, fine chopped
  :           Toasted breadcrumbs 1 ts Finely chopped fresh thyme Salt
  3 ts Chopped fresh chives Freshly milled black pepper 1 tb Finely
  chopped fresh parsley             Oil for deep frying
  
  Hard-boil the eggs by covering them in cold water, bringing it to the
  boil, simmering gently for 9 minutes and cooling them under cold
  running water. Next mix the sausage meat with the spring onions and
  herbs and season well. Then shell the cooled eggs and coat each one
  with some of the seasoned flour.  Divide the sausage meat into four
  portions and pat each piece out on a floured surface to a shape
  roughly 5x3 inches. Now place an egg in the center of each piece and
  carefully gather up the sausage meat to cover the egg completely.
  Seal one by one, first in beaten egg and then throughly and evenly in
  the breadcrumbs. Now heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep frying pan up
  to a temperature of 350-375 F. Put the eggs into the oil and fry for
  6-8 minutes, turning frequently until they have turned a nice broun
  colour. Drain on crumpled greaseproof paper. When they're absolutely
  cold, wrap in cling wrap and store.

  (My comment: Preheat oven to 425 F.  I suggest you plump the
  raisins.) (I vary the items marked *)
      Add butter, milk and egg to combined dry ingredients; mix just
  until dry ingredients are moistened. Stir in raisins. Shape dough to
  form ball*; pat out on lightly floured surace to form 8-inch circle*.
  Cut into 8 to 12* wedges; bake on greased cookie sheet in preheated
  hot oven (425 F.) 12 to 15 minutes or until light golden brown.
  Serve warm at breakfast or brunch with butter, preserves or honey, as
  desired.
     Made as above, with BUTTER, these are absolutely wonderful! The
  buttery aroma is to die for!  However, I seldom make them that way
  because of the cholesterol and because my wife and I almost always
  use whole wheat flour.

      Title: SCOTTISH RABBIT CURRY
 Categories: Ethnic, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Fresh Rabbit
      6 oz Streaky Bacon
      6    Button onions
      4 tb Butter
      1 tb Flour
      1 tb Curry-powder
      1 ts Mushroom-powder
           Celery (optional)
           Coco-nut (optional)
           Salt and cayenne to taste
      1 pt Well seasoned stock
 
  Choose a fat, fresh rabbit.  (To test it, examine the kidney.) Cut it
  into at least twelve pieces; brown these in butter, with onions. When
  browned, if you wish delicate cookery, pour off the butter and add
  three-quarters of a pint of well-seasoned stock, one large spoonful
  of curry-powder and one of flour, six ounces of streaky bacon cut
  into half inch cubes, and also half a dozen button onions.  Season
  with a teaspoonful of mushroom powder. Simmer this slowly for half an
  hour at least, stirring it. Add what more seasonings you think
  required, as cayenne, a little turmeric, or some acid. Pile up the
  pieces of rabbit and pour the sauce, which should be thickish as in
  all curry dishes, over them. Serve with plain boiled rice in a
  separate dish.
  
  Fresh coco-nut is an excellent ingredient in mild curries. Rasp and
  stew it the whole time; we do not like green vegetables in curries
  though they are sometimes used.  Mushrooms are an enrichment, celery
  is good, and onion is indispensable.

  thoroughly. Line the bottom of a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with
  parchment paper, spread the batter in the pan and bake in a preheated
  400f oven for 8 minutes or until it is puffed and golden.  Invert
  onto a lightly sugared kitchen towel.
  
  In a small saucepan, melt the jam over low heat.  Stir in kirsch and
  spread the surface of the cake with the jam mixture. Starting with a
  long side and using the towel as a guide, roll up the cake,
  jelly-roll fashion and sprinkle it with Sherry.  Wrap the sponge roll
  firmly in the towel. Let it cool and cut int into 3/4-inch slices.
  
  In a bowl, set over a saucepan of simmering water, beat the yolks and
  the sugar with an electric mixer until the mixture is thick and pale.
  Remove from heat and stir in gradually, milk, cream, and vanilla.
  Cook the custard in the bowl over the simmering water, until it
  registers 170f on a candy thermometer. Transfer the custard to a
  metal bowl and whisk in the creme fraiche and Sherry.  Set the bowl
  in a larger bowl of ice water and whisk until custard is cool. Chill
  it, covering surface with plastic wrap, until it is cold.
  
  Assembly:     In the bottom of a 2-1/2-qt. trifle bowl, scatter half
  the amaretti crumbs.  Top them with half the sponge roll slices, and
  top those with the remaining amaretti crumbs. Sprinkle the Sherry
  over the remaining sponge roll slices, line the side of the bowl with
  the slices, and pour in the custard, spreading it to let it seep down
  around the sided and bottom. Chill the trifle for at least 2 hours
  and up to 24 hours.
  
  Just before serving, in a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream
  until it is stiff.  Transfer it to a pastry bag, fitted with a
  decorative tip and pipe rosettes around the edge and in the center of
  the trifle. Sprinkle pistachios over the trifle and garnish the
  rosettes with the citron and small drops of jam.

      Title: SCOURING CLEANER
 Categories: Household, Better
      Yield: 14 Oz
 
MMMMM---------------------CHEAPER AND BETTER--------------------------
    1/2 c  Soap flakes OR SOFT SOAP
      2 ts Borax
  1 1/2 c  Hot water
      2 ts Whiting, up to 5t
           -(ground chalk, sold at
           -hardware stores)
 
  ** A custom designed cleanser to take care of your most delicate
  Fiberglass fixtures in the bathroom or spa. Rather than clean with
  the kind of harsh, sandy abrasives found in powdery cleansers, this
  softer version depends on chalk dust for its abrasive action, and you
  can control the amount of abrasion by reducing the amount of whiting
  you use. Start with 2t whiting. If appliances are old, white, scarred
  and pitted use full amount 5t.
  
  In lg plastic bowl, mix soap flakes and borax into water until
  dissolved. Add whiting, checking the consistency and degree of
  abrasiveness after each teaspoon. Pour into a squeeze top plastic
  container, label, and keep out of the reach of children.
  
  To Use: Squeeze some of the cleanser onto a sponge and then wipe down
  your appliance. Rinse, dry. For heavily soiled areas, squeeze
  directly onto the spot or stain and let it remain 30 mins. Scrub off,
  rinse, and repeat if necessary. 14 oz. Typed by Sherilyn Schamber

      1    To 2 green chilies, seeded
           -and sliced (optional)
 
  1. Break the eggs into a small bowl, add salt, and beat slightly to
  mix. Do not overbeat, as eggs should not be foamy or frothy.
  
  2. Beat the shortening or oil in a frying pan (9-10 inches in
  diameter), and add onions. Over medium-low heat, saute onions until
  they are translucent but still firm and crisp (about 3-4 minutes).
  
  3. Reduce heat to low, and add the beaten eggs.  Let the eggs settle
  in the pan for 5 seconds.  Then, using a fork, begin pushing the egg
  toward the center of the pan so that it cooks like a thick cake. When
  most of the egg has coagulated, turn it gently and cook the other
  side. (Don't worry if it breaks, as the finished dish will, in fact,
  look like little cakes of scrambled egg studded with onions.)
  Continue stirring and turning until the eggs are fully cooked (about
  3 minutes). Do not let them brown. Turn off heat, and transfer to a
  warm serving platter. Serve sprinkled with roasted cumin, chopped
  coriander leaves and green chilies.
  
  * To roast the cumin, add to a dry, preheated, heavy frying pan, and
  cook until the seeds turn a dark brown. Grind fine, and you're ready
  to go.

 Categories: Petfood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Egg
      1    Slice ham, finely chopped
      2 tb Grated cheese
           Splash of milk
 
  Beat the eggs; then add the chopped ham and grated cheese. Add a
  splash of milk (this makes scrambled eggs fluffy). Pour into skillet
  and gently scramble until thoroughly cooked. Cool to room temperature
  (takes about 10 minutes) and serve.  Note:  Cats should always be fed
  cooked eggs, not raw, because raw egg whites interfere with the
  absorption of biotin, one of the B vitamins. Raw eggs also carry the
  danger of salmonella poisoning. Feed cooked eggs no more than twice a
  week. Typed in MMFormat by cjhartlin@msn.com  Source: Cat Treats

      Title: SCRAMBLED TOFU
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 tb Olive or canola oil
      1 lg Onion
           - peeled & coarsely chopped
      2 lg Garlic cloves
           - peeled & finely chopped
      6    Scallions; thinly sliced,
           - (keep white & green parts
           -  separate)
    1/4 lb Mushrooms; thinly sliced
      1 sm Red bell pepper
           - seeded and diced
      1 lb Silken or soft tofu; drained
           - mashed or crumbled
    1/2 ts Dried leaf oregano
    1/4 ts Tumeric (optional)
    1/4 c  Finely chopped green olives
           -(pitted)
      1    Sheet nori sea vegetable
           - finely shredded (optional)
           Tamari or soy sauce
           - to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Hot sauce (optional)
 
  Great for brunch or a light supper dish, this recipe can easily be
  doubled to serve 4 to 6.  Silken tofu results in a very soft-cooked
  texture, while soft tofu will be slightly firmer.
  
  NOTE: Tumeric will give a faint yellow color to the mixture, but will
  not contribute significantly to the taste.
  
  DIRECTIONS: In a large skillet or wok, heat the oil and saute the
  onion, garlic, and white of scallions until the onions turn light
  brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.
  
  Add the mushrooms, red pepper, tofu, oregano, and tumeric (if using),
  and continue to saute over medium-high heat for another 3 minutes,
  stirring frequently.  Stir in the scallion greens, olives, nori (if
  using), soy sauce and pepper to taste.  Pass optional hot sauce.

  Parboil pork scraps or head, in water to cover, for 10 minutes. Drain;
  discard water. return to pot with fresh water to cover, salt,
  peppercorns, cloves and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer
  for 3 hours, or until meat falls off the bones easily. Strain stock;
  reserve. Remove all meat from bones and chop; set aside.
  
  Reheat stock; gradually add cornmeal, stirring constantly until thick,
  about 15 minutes.  Add meat, onion, cayenne, nutmeg and sage; adjust
  seasonings with salt and pepper. Pour into 2 greased loaf pans.
  Refrigerate until set.  Slice and fry for breakfast. Will keep in the
  refrigerator for up to 1 week.
  
  Serves 12.

  NORI: 8x10" paper-thin sheets.  Green if pre-toasted, purplish if
  not. Also labeled 'dried laver'.  Also available as confetti-like
  ribbons. For making vegan nori rolls (sheets) or sprinkling on top of
  soba noodles, etc. (ribbons).  Nori can also be cut into squares and
  toasted in a dry frying pan to eat as a snack. Yum. My parents used
  to feed me this when I was a little kid.
  
  HIJIKI: small 1/2-1" deep purplish-black strands. Expands to about 2"
  long flowerlike things when soaked. Strong tasting, good for soups.
  
  WAKAME: long 1/2" wide dark-green ribbons, expands to 1" wide when
  soaked. Kind of slimy.  Good in miso or in stir fries. Also sold as
  1/4-1/2" thick rounds about 10" in diameter, with a rough surface.
  This is just a more 'condensed' way of storing the stuff as far as I
  can tell.
  
  KOMBU:  8-10" wide, tough strips with a powdery white (salt) coating.
  Used to flavor soup stocks, rice, etc. Can also be cut into squares
  and eaten but I don't like it, it's really tough and crunchy even
  when cooked for a long time.  Maybe I just had a bad experience.

    of the seasonings and the garlic.  Keep scraping the bottom so
  nothing
    burns.  Add the tomatoes, the tomato sauce and the green onions.
  Cook
    until all is heated together.   Add the chicken stock and bring to a
    boil.  Add the rice, cover and reduce heat to a simmer but keep it
    bubbling.  After about 10 minutes, stir in the shrimp. After about

    1/2 lb Crab meat
      2 cn Clams (and juice)
    1/2 c  Onion, chopped
    1/4 c  Bell pepper, chopped
    1/2 c  Margarine
           Chicken stock (or bouillon)

      1 tb Celery, chopped
           Parsley, chopped
           Garlic, minced
           Salt, to taste
           Black pepper, to taste

      2 c  Mushrooms, sliced
      2 c  Rice, raw
           Saffron (1/2 vial),
           -shredded
 
  Saute onion and bell pepper in margarine until translucent. Add water
  (and some chicken stock) and a hint of garlic. Add celery, parsley,
  salt and MSG. (Water that comes out of seafood will make another 1/2
  cup of liquid.) Add mushrooms and clams; cover and bring to boil over
  medium-high heat.
  
  When water comes to rolling boil, put in rice and bring back to
  LOWEST boil possible.  Add saffron; cover pot and don't touch it for
  15 minutes. Rice should be cooked, but not split at ends yet --> a
  little on the dry side. Dump in all the seafood and stir thoroughly.
  Bring back to a simmer; cover and cook 10 minutes. Might need to cook
  a little longer with the top off if the shrimp exude a lot of liquid.
  Check seasonings; can add more butter or pepper.
  
  Mom's notes:
  
  *  Might want to add oysters, too.  Don't drain the clams!
  
  *  If you use canned mushrooms instead of fresh, add them when you
  put in the seafood.

      1    Onion; medium, minced
      1 tb Butter
  1 1/2 ts Thyme
  1 1/4 ts Celery salt
      2 c  Whipping cream
      9 oz Haddock or halibut fillets

    1/2 ts -pepper
           Paprika for garnish
 
  "A traditional Atlantic chowder is made with fish or shellfish, canned
  milk, potatoes, onions and is served with a dollop of butter. This
  version, which comes from a Nova Scotia fisherman and uses sour
  cream, fresh cream and thyme, is quite different and very good. When
  reheated leftover chowder, it may be necessary to add a little more
  milk or cream, because the fish and potatoes will have absorbed some
  of the liquid."
  
  Cook the onion in the butter until transparent. Add the thyme and
  celery salt. Remove from heat. In a saucepan, pour the whipping cream
  over the fish fillets.Cover, bring to a boil and simmer slowly for 10
  minutes or till the fish flakes easily. Remove the fish with a
  slotted spoon, then break into small pieces and remove any bones. Add
  the onion mixture and the scallops to the poaching liquid. Bring to
  barely a boil, then simmer for about 1 minute or till the scallops
  are opaque. If the chowder is not to be eaten immediately,
  refrigerate everything at this stage. Just before serving, add the
  fish, lobster, sour cream, potatoes and milk. Heat through, but do
  not allow to boil. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into soup
  bowls. Sprinkle with paprika. Serve immediately. SERVES: 4-6

 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 sm Onion; finely minced
    1/2    Celery stalk; finely diced
      3 tb All-purpose flour
    1/3 c  Milk
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
           Bread crumbs
      1 lb Cooked fish and/or shellfish
           - such as salmon, shrimp,
           - scallops, white fish,
           - or a combination
      1 tb Finely chopped parsley
      1 tb Chopped chives
      1 ts Salt; or as desired
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper; as desired
           Flavorless cooking oil
 
  MELT THE BUTTER in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and
  celery and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes or until soft. Add
  the flour, stirring to form a paste. Add the milk and nutmeg and cook
  another minute or so until mixture thickens. Meanwhile, place bread
  crumbs on a plate. Scrape the mixture into a mixing bowl and add the
  fish, parsley, chives, salt and pepper. Using 2 forks, mash the fish
  into the mixture. Drop tablespoon dollops of the mixture into the
  bread crumbs. Roll each dollop in bread crumbs, then between the
  palms of your hands to form balls. Set croquettes aside on a plate
  while making the rest. Fill a medium-sized cast iron or other heavy
  skillet with a 1 1/2-inch depth of oil and place over medium heat on
  the stove. Heat the oil to frying temperature--350F. When the oil is
  hot enough for frying, a droplet of water will dance across the
  surface of the hot oil and evaporate. Drop croquettes carefully into
  the hot oil. Fry croquettes, in batches if necessary, without
  crowding the skillet, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Using a
  slotted spoon, remove croquettes from the oil as they are done and
  drain on paper towels. Place a linen napkin on a platter and arrange
  the croquettes in a pile. Serve immediately and accompany with tomato
  mayonnaise. TO FREEZE the mixture: Place croquettes on a lightly
  oiled cookie sheet and place in the freezer. When the croquettes are
  frozen, transfer them to airtight plastic bags or a lidded freezer
  container. Cook frozen uncooked croquettes directly from the freezer,
  increasing cooking time to 5 minutes. TO FREEZE COOKED CROQUETTES:
  Cool cooked croquettes to room temperature, uncovered. Place in an
  airtight plastic freezer bag or lidded container. Label and place in
  freezer for up to 3 months. To cook frozen cooked croquettes, place
  on a cookie sheet and place in preheated 375F oven for 20 minutes.

           Parchment paper
           Vegetable oil
    1/4 lb Mushrooms; rinsed and sliced
      2    Green onions
           - sliced on diagonal,
           - with green part saved
      2 tb Parsley
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Rinse flounder, shrimp and scallops and set
  aside on a paper towel. Melt butter in a skillet, stir in the flour
  and cook until tan. Stirring constantly, gradually add the fish
  stock. Bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced
  by half, stirring as needed. Add the wine and season to taste with
  salt and pepper. Add a little of the hot sauce to the egg yolks and
  then stir the yolks back into the sauce. Stir for a moment over low
  heat without overcooking the yolks. Strain if necessary. You can make
  4 individual pouches or one large one. Cut 8 small or 2 large sheets
  of parchment paper or aluminum foil. Brush half with the oil. Place
  the fillets side by side in the middle of the large sheet, or one
  fillet on each small sheet. Place 1/4 of the shrimp, scallops,
  mushroom, green onion and parsley on top of each fillet. Spoon the
  sauce liberally over the seafood and top with the reserved green
  onion. Top with a similar sheet of parchment paper, securing tightly,
  so that no juice can escape. May be made ahead to this point and
  refrigerated. Place the pouches on an oiled baking sheet and bake
  until the paper browns, about 10 minutes. Serve in the pouch slitting
  the pouch at the table, or open the pouch and turn onto a plate or
  the serving platter just before serving. Serve this with boiled rice
  (See RECIPE).

  mixture and let cook slowly for 20-30 minutes.
   Add oysters and crabmeat, cook for another 10-15 minutes.
   NOTE: If ya don't use okra, you can use gumbo file', which is crushed
  sassafras leaves, available in the spices rack of the grocery store.
  When using file' instead of okra, add it only after the heat is
  off... don't simmer or boil file'... it gets stringy. Let gumbo stand
  a few minutes after adding file' before serving. Serve over cooked

  Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer several hours. Strain the
  stock, discarding solids. (If time is a factor, simmer shrimp heads
  and shells and ham hocks in chicken stock for at least an hour.) 2)
  Cook okra in the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat, stirring
  and scraping until some of the sliminess is gone; about 15 minutes.
  Add tomatoes, onions, celery, garlic, peppers, vinegar, the seasoning
  and herb mix and cook over low to medium heat for about 1/2 hour,
  stirring and scraping often. 3) Blend the roux into the okra and
  tomato mixture. Very slowly blend the stock into the mixture. Simmer
  about 1 hour. 4) Add crab and shrimp and simmer 10 to 15 minutes. Add
  oysters and simmer about 5 minutes. Add green onions. Serve over rice
  with file` powder added to taste at the table. (File` powder should
  not be cooked.) Source: Overton Anderson

  This was originally posted 5/5 by Patti Anderson.
   I've just made it once, but we loved it and it will probably be a
  family favorite. Heat butter in a large saucepan over low heat until
  melted. Add garlic.
   Stir in flour and salt.  Cook, stirring constantly until bubbly.
  Remove from heat.  Stir in milk, broth and white wine. Return to
  stove and heat until boiling, stirring constantly. Boil for one
  minute. Stir in mozzarella, onions, basil and pepper.  Cook over low
  heat until cheese is melted, stirring constantly. Spread about 1 1/2
  cups of the sauce in an ungreased 9X13 pan.  Top with uncooked
  lasagna noodles, overlapping as needed.  Spread cottage cheese over
  the noodles. Spread with another 1 1/2 cups of sauce, and then with
  another 5 noodles. Top with seafood and another round of sauce.  Add
  last 5 noodles and top with all remaining sauce.  If desired top with
  1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 deg. for
  35-40 minutes or until the noodles are tender. Let stand for 15
  minutes before cutting. When I made this, I just used 1 cup each of
  shrimp and faux crab meat, and skipped the scallops.
   The "crab" was just fine.  I mashed the cottage cheese, since I
  don't like the texture of curds.  Next time I'll use ricotta. Make
  sure when you measure the last sauce that you leave at least 1 1/2
  cups for the top, so you don't have crispy noodle tips exposed.
    Also, we didn't want to overlap the noodles so much, so we just
  broke them to make a complete layer.
      Hope you like this as much as we did! FROM: HEIDI MCCULLOUGH

      Title: SEAFOOD PANCAKES
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Cakes, Pancakes, Breakfast
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour
      1    Pinch salt
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
      4 ts Oil
  1 1/2 c  Milk plus 1 Tbsp
    1/2 lb Monkfish
      6    Scallops
    3/4 c  Milk
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped
    1/2 lb Shrimp, shelled
      2 tb Butter
      3 tb Flour
    1/4 c  Light cream
      1 c  Gruyere Cheese
      2 tb Parsley, fresh, chopped
      1    Salt and pepper
  1 1/2 tb Oil for frying
 
  Servings: 10
  
  Make pancake batter by mixing flour and salt in mixing bowl. Make
  well in center and pour in the egg, 4 tsp oil and 1 cup milk. Whisk
  to smooth batter then add remaining milk.
  
  Remove any skin from monkfish, rinse and cut into bite-size pieces.
  Pat dry. Rinse and pat dry scallops, cut in half. Pour 3/4 cup milk
  into saucepan, add garlic and bring to simmer.  Add all fish except
  shrimp. Simmer for 5-6 minutes then add shrimp. When shrimp turn pink
  remove all fish to a bowl and set aside. Strain fish milk and reserve
  for sauce. Place butter in saucepan and melt, add flour and stir for
  2 minutes, then pour in reserved milk and the cream. Continue to stir
  and simmer for a few minutes until you have a smooth sauce. Turn heat
  to low, add cheese and parsley and season to taste with salt and
  pepper. Add fish, mix well.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Place small frying pan or omelet pan over high heat. Lightly grease
  it with a little oil. Beat pancake batter, then pour 3 Tbsp into pan.
  Turn pan so bottom is covered evenly with batter and cook for 40-60
  seconds, turn and cook 30-40 seconds longer. Transfer to large plate.
  Continue with remaining batter. (There should be enough filling for
  10 pancakes.) Place an equal amount of filling (about 3 Tbsp) in
  center of each pancake, fold the sides over filling and arrange in
  ovenproof dish just large enough to hold pancakes. Place in oven for
  20 minutes, or until the pancakes are hot through.  Serve immediately.
  
  These thin pancakes, which conceal a tasty mixture of fish, will
  appeal to the masked and mysterious side of the Cancerian, who when
  in need of refreshment and quiet will reture into his or her own
  protective shell. These can be served as a first course or as a
  luncheon dish for four, with a green salad and a very chilled white
  wine.

      Title: SEAFOOD PITA
 Categories: Sandwiches, Seafood
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Scallops or Shrimp
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 md Onion
      1    Garlic cloves
           -(more or less to taste)
    3/4 c  Mushrooms
  1 1/2 c  Vegetable (such as
           -eggplant or zucchini)
           Salt, pepper and
           -spices (to taste)
  1 1/2 c  Couscous, cooked
           Pita bread
 
  Cut up the vegetables into small (about 1/2 inch) cubes. Slice the
  mushrooms.
  
  If using shrimp, peel and de-vein the shrimp and cut into small cubes.
  
  In a small amount of olive oil, saute the onion and the optional
  garlic until the onion is soft but not quite transparent.
  
  Heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet and add the vegetable and
  mushrooms. Saute until the vegetables are almost soft. Taste and add
  salt, pepper and whatever spices strike your fancy (oregano, basil
  and red pepper are good). Add the scallops or shrimp and cook until
  just done, about a minute or two. Scallops will turn opaque and
  shrimp will turn pink. Do NOT overcook.
  
  There should be an excess of oil and fluid.  If not, add more oil and
  briefly heat. Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Add the couscous and mix
  thoroughly. Chill several hours or overnight.
  
  Stuff into the pita bread (maybe with some tomato) and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pita-Seafood Salad Sandwiches -- This recipe is more of a formula
  than a recipe.  It is excellent for a cool dinner in the summer (any
  time after February in Texas!) Yield: Serves 2-4.
  
  *  You could substitute almost any vegetable and crab or a firm fish.
  To use this for a picnic, don't stuff the pita bread until you are
  about to serve it. Err on the side of too much oil, since the
  couscous absorbs the oil (and a recent study says that olive oil may
  be good for you).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chilling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Seafood, Sandwiches
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 sm Whole wheat tortilla
      1 tb Salsa (see recipe below)
    1/4 c  Cooked flaked crab meat
           Or 5 cooked medium shrimp,
           Sliced
      1 oz Shredded Jack cheese
      2 tb Canned, diced green chiles

MMMMM---------------------------SALSA--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Diced tomatoes
      1 tb Chopped cilantro*
    1/4 c  Chopped green onions
    1/4 c  Chopped, mild chile
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
  In small bowl combine all ingredients for salsa. Cover tortilla with
  salsa. On half of tortilla spread seafood, cheese and chiles. Fold
  tortilla in half to enclose filling. Cook in non-stick skillet, or
  place under broiler until cheese is hot and bubbly.  Turn tortilla to
  brown both sides. Cut into 4 wedges. (It looks like more food!) Serve
  with extra salsa if desired.
  
  NOTE:  If you prefer, omit the seafood and count just 1 meat card for
  the cheese.  Also, if you prefer, choose a low-fat cheese. This will
  let you omit the fat card. Work with these recipes so that they can
  work in the best way possible for you.
  
  *Freebie:  Cilantro is know as Coriander in some parts of the
  country. It is an acquired taste, so if you don't care for it,
  substitute parsley. If you haven't tried it, give it a chance. It
  adds a lot of flavor to a dish.

     12 md Tomatoes, peeled, seeded &
           -diced

      1 c  White wine (240ml)
      2    Or 3 sprigs fresh thyme
      2    Bay leaves
      6    Peppercorns
      3 tb Oil
           Poaching liquid & clam broth
      3    To 4 tablespoons rice flour
 
  You guys over on the right coast should be able to find all this at
  hand. Chef Phil Sheremeta of The Pasta Shop, (Oakland, Ca.),
  developed this recipe. Buy or make your own saffron ravioli dough to
  stuff with this delectable combination of Spanish flavors.
  
  Clean shrimp and reserve shells.  Poach shrimp in well salted water
  with pickling spice.  Discard liquid. Poach halibut in wine until
  set. Do not overcook. Steam clams in white wine and garlic. Remove
  from shells and reserve liquid.  Leave smaller clams whole and
  coarsely chop larger ones. Gently toss seafood together and dress
  with olive oil. Set aside.
  
  SAUCE:
  
  SPECIAL REQUIREMENT:  cheesecloth, parchment paper, rice flour.
  
  Steep threads in white wine for 30 minutes.  Cook shrimp shells in
  hot oil just until they turn pink. Then combine them with thyme, bay
  leaves and peppercorns in cheesecloth.  Saute onion until soft and
  golden, not brown, in oil used for shrimp shells. Add garlic and
  saute for an additional 5 minutes. Deglaze pan with white wine,
  poaching liquid and clam broth. Add tomatoes and cheesecloth sachet.
  Simmer for 1 3/4 hours. Add orange juice and zest and simmer for an
  additional 15 minutes.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE:
  
  Place about 1 tablespoon seafood mix on each large size ravioli pasta
  sheet, cover with second layer. Moisten borders with water, press out
  any air, and cut with fluted ravioli cutter. Lay on sheet pans lined
  with parchment paper and sprinkle with rice flour to keep dry. Cover
  with plastic.
  
  TO COOK:
  
  Use a wide pan with plenty of water.  Cook 3 or-4 raviolis at a time
  for 3 to 4 minutes, removing them with a slotted spoon. Serve on a
  bed of the Spanish sauce.

  ingredients through a meat grinder fitted with medium holes. Stuff the
  mixture into sausage casings or form 2 long sausages in plastic wrap.
  Poach the sausages in gently simmering water for 5 minutes, drain and
  let cool. If you have used plastic wrap to form the sausages, remove
  it when sausages are cool. Cut sausages into 6-inch lengths. To
  serve, grill the sausages or place under a preheated broiler. Since
  the sausages are already cooked, we want only to reheat them and
  crisp their skins. Makes 8 Sausages, or 4 Servings

 Categories: Cajun
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Rinsed shrimp heads & shells
      4 qt Water
 
  You may also use crawfish heads and/or shells, or rinsed fish
  carcasses (heads and gills removed), or some combination.
  
  In a large stockpot, combine the watere and the seafood. Bring to a
  boil.
   Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer 3 to 4 hours, or until the liquid
  is reduced by half.  Remove from the heat and strain through a sieve.
  Allow it to cool slightly, then refrigerate or freeze in batches
  until needed.
  
  note:  I generally throw in some coarsely chopped onion, bell pepper
  and celery to add some additional flavor. But if you just want the
  seafood taste, which is needed for some of the delicate sauces, just
  use this basic recipe.

  tender, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 3 tablespoons of
  the butter and the white and red peppers; stir until butter is
  melted. Stir in the shrimp and the first seasoning mix. Continue
  cooking for about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping
  pan bottom well. Stir in the stock and the oysters; cook and stir
  about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Use a slotted spoon to spoon
  the seafood vegetable mixture into a food processor or blender,
  leaving the liquid in the skillet; process mixture until smooth,
  about 15 to 30 seconds. Return mixture to skillet, stirring to blend
  with liquid; turn heat to high, and cook until mixture starts
  sticking excessively, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and
  scraping pan bottom well. Remove from heat. Meanwhile, in a 1-quart
  saucepan melt the remaining 6 tablespoons butter over high heat; when
  almost melted, remove from heat, then add 1/4 cup of the flour and
  stir until mixture is smooth. Return to high heat for 1 minute,
  stirring constantly. Turn heat to high under the stuffing mixture;
  gradually add the butter-flour mixture, stirring constantly until
  well blended. If mixture starts "weeping" oil at this point, stir in
  about 2 tablespoons more stock or water.) Continue cooking until very
  thick, about 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the green
  onions and cook 1 minute more, stirring constantly. Remove from heat
  and stir in the Parmesan. Cool slightly, then refrigerate until
  chilled, about 30 minutes. In a small bowl thoroughly combine the
  flounder seasoning mix ingredients. Open the flounders for stuffing.
  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon ofthe seasoning mix on the inside of each
  flouner. Mound 1/4 cup of the cheddar cheese in the center of each,
  then spoon a scant 1/2 cup chilled stuffing on top of the cheese.
  Close the fish so the stuffing doesn't show. Cover and refrigerate
  for 1 to 2 hours. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of the seasoning mix on each
  side of each chilled flounder, patting it in with your hands. In a
  pan (cake and pie pans work well) combine the remaining seasoning mix
  with the remaining 1/2 cup flour. In a large, heavy skillet heat 1/4
  inch oil over high heat to about 350F. Meanwhile, place each flounder
  (split side up) in the seasoned flour to coat only the bottom
  surface. Carefully slide each flounder into the hot oil and fry the
  bottom until it's crispy, crunchy and brown-brown!-- about 3 to 4
  minutes. Without draining, place the flounder, still split side up,
  on an ungreased cooke sheet. Bake at 550F until the fish are cooked
  and well browned on top, about 10 minutes (after about 4 minutes,
  drape a piece of aluminum foil over the tails so they won't burn).
  Serve immediately as is, or topped with Hollandaise Sauce, Shrimp and
  Crab Buttercream Sauce, or Bearnaise Sauce From Paul Prudhomme's
  Louisiana Kitchen

      3 tb Flour
      3 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Monterey Jack, shredded

      1 lb Imitation crab legs
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
      4 ea Tortillas
 
  Melt butter in saucepan. Stir in flour, then cook, stirring
  constantly, for 1 minute. Gradually stir in milk, then cook, stirring
  constantly, until bubbly thick. Stir in Monterey Jack cheese and
  cayenne pepper.
  
  Preheat oven to 375. Grease a 9"x13" glass baking dish. Finely chop
  onion. Saute onion in butter in skillet. Stir in parsley, cheese, and
  just enough white sauce to moisten.  Stir in chopped crab legs and
  cayenne pepper. Divide filling among tortillas, then roll up and
  arrange seam side down in a dish.  Pour remaining white sauce over.
  Cover with foil. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly hot.
  
  Sylvia's comments: I doubt a Mexican would find anything authentic
  about this, but it was sure good! For a potluck, I used 20 small
  tortillas instead of 8 large ones. If the filling is still warm when
  you put the finished tortillas into the oven, 10-20 minutes is plenty
  of time to get it hot.

      Title: SEARED PINEAPPLE SALSA
 Categories: Sauces, Fruits, Vegetables, Vegetarian
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
      1    Pineapple, peeled & cored
    1/4 c  Red bell pepper, diced
      2 ts Chipotle chile puree
      2 tb Orange juice
      1 tb Lime juice
      1 tb Cilantro, minced
      2 ts Brown sugar
 
  Cut pineapple into slices no more than 1/4" thick. Cut each slice in
  half. Dry saute the pineapple slices in a skillet for 8 minutes or
  so. You want it to be caremalized & golden brown, be careful not to
  use too high a heat. When cooked, dice & transfer to a mixing bowl.
  
  Stir in the remaining ingredients & taste to see if you need more lime
  juice or chile puree.
  
  This salsa rates a cool 4 out of 10.  As a variation, replace the
  pineapple with peaches & cook using the same directions.

 Categories: Seafood, Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Center-cut salmon fillets,
           -skin on, about 8 oz each
      1 tb Vegetable oil

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE MARINADE---------------------------
    1/2 c  White-wine vinegar
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
      3 tb Finely chopped garlic
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  As it sears over high heat, the salmon cooks skin-side down. The skin
  will become dark and crisp because the sugar crystallizes, imparting
  a great flavor.
  
  1. Combine marinade ingredients in a small saucepan and simmer over
  medium heat for 30 minutes. Cool.
  
  2. Place the salmon in the marinade and let rest at room temperature
  for 30 minutes.
  
  3. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet for 30 seconds over medium
  heat. Remove salmon from marinade and place in hot skillet, skin-side
  down. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 minutes, lifting
  salmon with a spatula to loosen it from the pan.
  
  4. Reduce heat to medium; cover; cook 3-4 minutes, until fish is just
  cooked through. Serve immediately.

  Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time: 10 mn Cook
  the Tuna Steaks quickly over a hot fire about 90 seconds - 2 minutes
  per side. The object is to cook the outside leaving the inside
  somewhat pink or "rare." Crush the green peppercorns with the back of
  a spoon and set aside. Warm a sauce pan and add the oil and butter.
  When warm, add the shallots and peppercorns and saute gently.
   After about 5 minutes add the remaining ingredients. Time the
  completion of the sauce with the completion of the fish. Remember
  that hot fish can continue cooking if it sits. Pour the sauce across
  the fish or lay the fish in a "bed" of sauce. From the collection of

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Whole steamed chicken
           -see below
      2 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Minced ginger
      2 ts Light soy sauce
      1 tb Teriyaki sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Toasted sesame seeds
    1/2 c  Finely shredded green onions
 
  Any large pot that will hold a  deep sided plate such as a pie tin
  will work. Put a few inches of  water in the pot and then put an
  inverted dish or wide can with the ends removed in the water and then
  place the plate on the  support. Anything that will hold the plate
  above the water and let the steam circulate will work. Bring the
  water to a boil and put the chicken in the pot. Cover tightly and let
  steam for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of the bird
  and how well done you want it. Turn off the heat, remove the lid and
  let the steam disperse. Remove the chicken and let it cool until you
  can handle it comfortably. While the chicken steams, heat the oil
  quite hot and then let it cool. Rub or brush the oil over the chicken
  and then the salt. At this point, you can bone and shred the chicken,
  cut it into Chinese style serving pieces or just disjoint it western
  style. Place on a bed of greens --lettuce or whatever you like. Heat
  the sesame oil in a small  pan and brown the ginger. Add soy sauce,
  teriyaki sauce and sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Pour sauce
  over the chicken and serve warm or at room temperature.

 Categories: Chinese, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      1    Scallion, minced
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Soy paste
      1 tb Sweet soy jam
    1/2 ts Chinese chili sauce
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
           Raw eggs, beaten and placed
           -in individual bowls
 
  This is a variant sauce with a slightly different cooking method.
  
  These amounts are for individual serving bowls. Increase them to suit
  the number of diners.  In this case, each diner grills the meat first
  then dips it in the raw egg to coat, then in the bowl of seasonings.
  Also served with steamed buns.  If soy paste and sweet soy jam are
  unavailable, substitute peanut butter (or tahini, I would imagine)

      Title: SEASONING MIXTURE FOR THE MONGOLIAN GRILL
 Categories: Info/tips, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Information
 
  Here's a couple of Mongolian Beef recipes for you. Incidentally, I
  have one of the Mongolian grills. It's a heavy, dome shaped,
  perforated cast iron grill with raised edges about 11 inches in
  diameter. I use it on an Iwatani table top gas burner.  It's a great
  hit for guests. Easy on the chef too. I just slice up all the
  ingredients, make the marinades and dips then put it all on the table
  and turn everyone loose to cook their own. Had a hard time finding it
  but finally tracked one down in a Japanese hardware store in San
  Francisco.  It was about $25.00.  A substitute would be a hibachi
  with a wire mesh cover laid on the grate. These are quite unlike the
  "Mongolian Beef" served in restaurants over a bed of deep fried
  cellophane noodles.
  
  Basically, what you do is slice the meat of your choice into thin, 1 x
  3-inch strips then dip them in the marinade and toss 'em on the grill
  until they're done to your taste. Eat them with steamed buns or
  rolls. If you like, sliced veggies can be used too.
  
  1/2 c  scallions 2 ea garlic cloves, crushed 1/4 c parsley, chopped 1
  c water 1/2 c soy sauce 1 T sugar
  
  Enough for four.  Mix ingerdients and serve in four smaller bowls.
  Allow about 1/4 lb of tender fillet of beef or lamb.

      Title: SEASONING THE WOK
 Categories: Info/tips, Wok
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients
 
  Only iron and steel woks need to be seasoned. Stainless steel woks do
  not need this treatment as they are far less porous than iron or
  steel woks. However with stainless steel woks, more oil is required
  to prevent the food from sticking.
  
  Seasoning a steel wok enables foods to glide smoothly over the cooking
  surface of the wok. In a properly seasoned wok one should be able to
  make perfect omelettes. If the omelette even sticks ever so slightly,
  then the wok is not properly seasoned and should be re-seasoned.
  
  There are two methods for seasoning the iron or steel wok. After
  purchasing the wok, wash it out thoroughly with detergent to remove
  the surface grease which is applied to keep the wok from rusting
  while in shipment. Instead of grease some woks are coated with
  varnish coating and is difficult to remove. Bicarbonate of soda
  should be boiled in the wok to rid the surface of this coating. When
  the cooking surface of the wok is free of anti-rusting coatings,
  apply a thin coat of polyunsaturated cooking oil to the surface of
  the wok. Heat the wok up over a very high cooking flame for three or
  four minutes until the oil begins to smoke. Reduce the heat and keep
  the wok over low flame for the next half hour. From time to time
  brush some of the oil up around the sides of the wok to season it. At
  the end of half an hour the wok is ready to use.
  
  Another more thorough method of seasoning a wok is to brush
  polyunsaturated cooking oil on the cooking surface of the wok and
  then place the wok into an oven at 150'C. for four hours. The oil in
  the wok will become pooled while heating in the oven, so about every
  hour or so, take your brush and brush the oil up around the sides of
  the wok and continue heating.
  
  New woks may cause a slight metallic taste to the first two or three
  dishes that are cooked in it, but after use, the metallic taste
  disappears.

      Title: SECOND DAY APPLE SQUARES
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  White flour, unbleached
      2 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
    1/2 c  Butter (or margarine)
      1 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
      2 ts Cinnamon (or less)
      1 ts Soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Sour cream (or yogurt)
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1    Egg
      2 c  Apples, peeled and
           -finely chopped
           -(about 2 apples)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, combine the flour,
  brown sugar and margarine.  Blend at low speed, until the mixture
  forms fine crumbs. If you want to include them, stir in the nuts now.
  Place about 2 3/4 cups of the crumb mixture into an ungreased pan,
  about 13 x 9 inches. Press down firmly.
  
  Add the remaining ingredients (except for the apples) to the remaining
  crumb mixture. Blend well. Stir the chopped apples into the batter.
  Spoon the batter evenly over the crumb base in the pan. Bake at 350
  degrees F. for 30-40 minutes. If you use the larger pan, bake for
  25-30 minutes. Cool before cutting. Better yet, let it wait 24 hours
  before cutting. Store loosely covered.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sugary, moist apple squares -- Try to avoid eating very many of
  these squares on the day you make them, as they improve immeasurably
  on the second and third day! This recipe originally came from a
  Pillsbury bake-off. Yield: Makes 12-15 squares.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  the shell, and deveining them.  Leave the shells on the prawns
  because this keeps the prawns more tender, tasty and plumlp. Wash,
  drain and put prawns in a pie pan so as to be ready for steaming.
  
  Wash black beans two times and mash into a paste; then add the chopped
  garlic.
  
  Combine remaining ingredients, EXCEPT the oil.
  
  Pour mixture over prawns; then, pour oil on top.
  
  Cover and steam 10 minutes.  Serve over rice.

      Title: SEE YOU GAI (RED COOKED CHICKEN)
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Roasting chicken
  1 1/2 c  Cold water
  1 1/2 c  Dark soy sauce
    1/4 c  Chinese wine or dry sherry
      2    Inch piece fresh ginger,
           -peeled and sliced
      1    Clove garlic
     10    Sections star anise
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
      2 ts Sesame oil
 
  Here is the second chicken recipe from a really comprehensive and
  beautiful cookbook, THE COMPLETE ASIAN COOKBOOK by Charmaine Solomon.
  
  "Red cooking" is the term applied to cooking in dark soy sauce. The
  liquid that remains after cooking is called a "master sauce", and can
  be frozen or refrigerated for future use.  It should be used to cook
  meat or poultry at least once a week to keep it "alive." Cook chicken
  drumsticks this way for taking on picnics or serving at buffet
  parties. Fragrant with ginger and anise, red-cooked chicken will
  surely become one of your favorites.
  
  Serves: 8 to 10 as part of a large menu, 4-5 as a main meal with rice
  
  Wash chicken well.  Choose a saucepan into which chicken will just
  fit so that the soy liquid covers as much of the bird as possible.
  Put chicken into saucepan, breast down, then add all the ingredients
  except sesame oil. Bring slowly to the boil, then reduce heat, cover
  and simmer very gently for 15 minutes. Using tongs, turn chicken
  over, replace lid and simmer 20 minutes, basting breast with liquid
  every 5 minutes.
  
  Remove from heat and leave covered in the saucepan until cool. Lift
  chicken out of sauce, put on a serving platter and brush with sesame
  oil. This gives the chicken a glistening appearance as well as some
  extra flavor.
  
  Traditionally the chicken is put on a chopping board and cut in two
  lengthways with a sharp cleaver.  Each half is chopped into 1 1/2 inch
  strips and reassembled in the original shape. If this proves too much
  of an undertaking, simply carve the chicken into joints. Serve at room
  temperature with some of the cooking liquid as a dipping sauce.

      Title: SEE'S BUTTERSCOTCH LOLLIPOP
 Categories: Candies, Desserts, Cookies, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Heavy cream
      3 tb Light corn syrup
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           Nonstick spray
     12    Lollipop sticks or popsicle
           Sticks
     12    Shot glasses-expresso cups,
           Or
           Sake cups
           For the lollipop molds
 
  1.  Combine the first four ingredients in a saucepan over medium
  heat. Stir until the sugar has dissolved. 2. Let the mixture boil
  until it reaches 310 degrees F on a cooking thermometer (this is
  called the hard-crack stage), or until a small amount dropped in cold
  water separates into hard, brittle threads. 3. Stir in the vanilla,
  then remove from the heat. 4. Coat the molds with nonstick spray and
  pour the mixture in. (If you are using shot glasses, be sure to cool
  the mixture first so that the glass won't crack.) 5. Place a small
  piece of aluminum foil over each mold and press a lollipop stick or
  popsicle stick in the center. 6. When cool, remove from molds. Makes
  1 dozen lollipops.

      Title: SEITAN - METHOD I
 Categories: Info/tips, Vegetarian, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 c  Whole wheat bread flour
           -(Stone-ground), -=OR=-
           -Hi-gluten unbleached white
      3 c  Water (or more),
           -(depending on the amount
           - of gluten in the flour)
    1/2 c  Tamari
     12 sl Fresh ginger
           -(each about 1/8" thick)
      1    Piece kombu, about 3" long
 
  Yield: 14 ounces uncooked; 16 ounces cooked Time: 1 hour preparation;
  2 hours cooking
  
  Mix the flour and water by hand or in a machine to make a
  medium-stiff but not sticky dough.  Knead the dough by hand on a
  breadboard or tabletop, until it has the consistency of an earlobe,
  or by machine until the dough forms a ball that follows the path of
  the hook around the bowl. You may need to add a little extra water or
  flour to achieve the desired consistency.  Kneading with take about
  10 to 12 minutes by machine. Allow the dough to rest in a bowl of
  cold water for about 10 minutes.
  
  While the dough is resting, prepare the stock.  In a large pot, bring
  to boil 3 quarts of water.  Add the tamari, ginger, and kombu, and
  cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. This stock
  must be cold before it's used.  (The cold liquid causes the gluten to
  contract and prevents the seitan from acquiring a bready texture.)
  You will be using this stock to cook the seitan later.
  
  To wash out the starch, use warm water to begin with. Warm water
  loosens the dough and makes the task easier. Knead the dough,
  immersed in water, in the bowl. When the water turns milky, drain it
  off and refill the bowl with fresh water. In the final rinses, use
  cold water to tighten the gluten. If you wish, save the bran by
  straining the water through a fine sieve; the bran will be left
  behind.  Save the starch by allowing the milky water to settle in the
  bottom of the bowl; slowly pour off the water and collect the starch,
  which you can use for thickening soups, sauces, and stews.
  
  When kneading, remember to work toward the center of the dough so
  that it does not break into pieces. After about eight changes of
  water, you will begin to feel the dough become firmer and more
  elastic. The water will no longer become cloudy as you knead it. To
  make sure you have kneaded and rinsed it enough, lift the dough out
  of the water and squeeze it. The liquid oozing out should be clear,
  not milky.
  
  To shape the seitan, lightly oil a 1-pound loaf pan. Place the rinsed
  seitan in the pan and let it rest until the dough relaxes. (After the
  dough has been rinsed for the last time in cold water, the gluten
  will have tightened and the dough will be tense, tough, and resistant
  to taking on any other shape.) After it has rested for 10 minutes, it
  will be much more flexible.
  
  Seitan is cooked in two steps.  In the first step, the dough is put
  into a large pot with about 3 quarts of plain, boiling water. Boil
  the seitan for about 30 to 45 minutes, or until it floats to the
  surface. Drain the seitan and cut it into usable pieces (steaks,
  cutlets, 1-inch chunks, or whatever) or leave whole. Return the
  seitan to the cold tamari stock. Bring the stock to a boil, lower
  temperature, and simmer in the stock for 1-1/2 to 2 hours (45 minutes
  if the seitan is cut into small pieces). The second cooking step may
  also be done in a pressure cooker, in which case it would take
  between 30 to 45 minutes.
  
  To store seitan, keep it refrigerated, immersed in the tamari stock.
  Seitan will keep indefinitely if it is brought to a boil in the
  tamari stock and boiled for 10 minutes twice a week. Otherwise, use
  it within eight or nine days.
  
  VARIATIONS: Instead of boiling the seitan in plain water and then
  stock, let the seitan drain for a while after it has been rinsed.
  Slice it and either deep-fry or saute the slices until both sides are
  brown. Then cook it in the tamari stock according to the recipe.
  
  Seitan also may be cooked (at the second step) in a broth flavored
  with carrots, onion, celery, garlic, tamari, and black pepper, which
  will give it a flavor similar to pot roast. Shiitake mushrooms may
  also be added to the stock.

    3/4 c  Tamari
      1    Onion; peeled and sliced

    1/4 c  Ginger; sliced   -=OR=-
      2 ts -Ginger powder
 
  Yield: 1-3/4 lbs uncooked; 2-1/2 lbs cooked Time: 40 to 50 minutes
  preparation: 3 to 4 hours cooking
  
  Mix the flour and water together to make a medium-stiff dough. Knead
  it until it is elastic when pulled (about 8 to 10 minutes). Allow the
  dough to rest for about 5 minutes in a bowl of cold water.
  
  Wash out the starch by filling a large bowl (1-1/2 to 2 gallons) with
  warm water and kneading the dough in it, underwater. When the water
  turns white (after 1 to 2 minutes), drain it through a strainer,
  adding the floury residue back to the ball of dough.  Keep kneading,
  washing, and changing the water, until no more starch is given off.
  This may take as many as eight rinses, about 20 to 25 minutes.
  
  Pour 6 pints of water into a large pot.  Add the tamari, onion, kombu,
  ginger, and dough, and simmer for about 3 hours. (To speed up the
  cooking, you could cut the dough into small pieces, each about
  1-1/2"; the pieces would cook in about one hour.)  The seitan is
  properly cooked when it is firm to the touch and when it is firm in
  the center. You can check by cutting into the seitan.  If it is not
  done, it will feel like raw dough in the center.

      6 tb Tamari
      4 tb Apple juice concentrate
      1 c  -Water
    1/2 c  Ground, roasted pecan nuts
           -(Optional; this dish is

      3 md Apples; peeled, cored,
           - and thinly sliced
      2 tb Mirin or calvados or sherry
 
  NOTE: This recipe needs uncooked seitan.  Cut the seitan into four
  thin pieces (1/8 to 1/4 inch thick), each about 2 ounces. The thinner
  the better.  Fry the seitan in a (little?) hot oil until lightly
  browned and then simmer it in a little water for about 30 minutes
  before using. If you don't simmer it first, you may need to add more
  liquid to the recipe.
  
  Saute the onions and garlic in the oil until the onions are soft and
  translucent but not fully cooked.
  
  Place the seitan in an ovenproof baking dish and cover it with tamari,
  apple juice concentrate, and water. Cover with the sauteed onion
  mixture and sprinkle the ground pecans over it, if you wish. Fan the
  apples over the onions and pour the mirin on top.  Cover the dish
  with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil, and bake at 300 degrees F
  for 2 hours. Serve hot.

      Title: SEITAN II
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Raw gluten recipe
      2 tb Oil
      1 ts Roasted sesame oil
      1    Onion; chopped
     10    Garlic cloves; minced
      2 ts Ginger, fresh; grated
      1 ts Thyme
      4 c  ;water or vegetable broth
    1/4 c  Tamari
 
   Follow the recipe for the preparation of raw gluten.
   Set the raw gluten aside while you prepare the broth.
  
   Heat both kinds of oil together in a large heavy kettle. Add the
  onion, garlic, ginger, and thyme.
   Saute over low heat until the onion is tender.
  
   Add the water and the tamari. Cover the kettle and let the broth
  simmer over low heat while you roll out the gluten.
  
   Using your hands and/or a rolling pin, roll out and stretch the
  gluten to a 1/4--1/2-inch thicknes. This takes a little bit of
  patience because the gluten has a tendency to spring back to its
  original shape.
  
   Using a sharp knife or scissors, cut your thin slab of gluten into
  1/4--1/2-inch pieces.
  
   To cook the seitan, reduce the heat uner the broth, if necessary, so
  that it is just barely simmering. If the broth is too hot the seitan
  will become spongy, which is undesirable.) Drop the peices of raw
  gluten into the broth. Cover and cook over low heat for about 45
  minutes, or until the seitan is firm. Check occasionally during the
  cooking to make sure that the broth isjust barely simmering and not
  boiling.
  
   Seitan may be used in place of meat in any stir-fry dish. It is also
  a delicious addition to a vegetable stew.
  
   The broth used to cook the setian may be thickened with arrowroot,
  cornstarch, flour or the wheat starch from the starch water. The
  thickened broth makes a delicious sauce to serve with the seitan or
  ober grain dishes.
  
   Seitan may be frozen in an airtight plastic container, either with or
  without its broth.
  
   Makes approximately 4 cups
  
   Variation:
  
   Before cooking the seitan, cut the thin slabs of raw gluten into
  large, steak-like pieces instead of small bite-sized peices. Cook in
  the broth until firm, as described above. These seitan "steaks" may
  be breaded and fried until brown on both sides. Serve them with a
  sauce.

      Title: SEITAN PARMESAN
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 sl Seitan; each 1/4-inch thick
      3 tb Gluten flour
    1/2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
      1 ts Sea salt
      1 tb Basil; chopped
      1 tb Oregano; chopped
    1/4 ts White pepper
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      2 c  Tomato sauce
           Vegan Cheese; see recipe

MMMMM------------------OPTIONAL: BATTER DIPPED-----------------------
      1 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
    1/4 c  Gluten flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Beer
 
  In this recipe, the thickness of the seitan "cutlets" is important.
  If your seitan loaf is too small to yield six slices of about 4
  ounces each, you may have to divide the slices into smaller pieces;
  just make sure that each slice is about 1/4-inch thick. Drain the
  seitan but leave it slightly moist.
  
  Put the gluten flour in a large bowl so it can be used to dredge the
  seitan. In another large bowl, mix the pastry flour, salt, basil,
  oregano, and pepper. In a third bowl, have a little water available,
  if needed.
  
  Dredge the pieces of seitan in the gluten flour and, if the seitan is
  sticky-moist, dip it directly into the seasoned flour mixture and coat
  thoroughly. If the seitan is too dry after being dipped into the
  gluten, give it a quick flash dip into the bowl of water and then
  into the seasoned flour. Lay the dredged seitan on a piece of floured
  plastic wrap. Set aside until you are ready to fry the seitan.
  
  To fry the seitan, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
  When the oil is hot (but not smoking), add the seitan and saute both
  sides until brown. Remove and drain on paper towels for a few
  minutes. Then place the cutlets on a baking sheet and top with 1/2
  cup of tomato sauce and 2 tablespoons cheese. If all of the
  ingredients are warm, the baking time will be substantially shorter.
  Bake at 375 degrees F for about 10 to 20 minutes. Serve hot, straight
  from the oven, with a pasta of your choice and vegetables.
  
  VARIATIONS: You can also make this recipe using batter-dipped seitan.
  Mix the flours and salt together. Add the water and the beer, and mix
  until the batter is smooth. If necessary, add more beer to thin out
  the batter to the consistency of heavy cream. Follow the directions
  for making Seitan Parmesan up to and including dredging the seitan
  with gluten flour. Dip the floured seitan cutlets into the batter and
  then immediately into the hot oil. Brown on both sides and serve as
  suggested above.

      1 ts Miso
      1 pn Nutmeg (optional)
 
  For BATTER: Mix together flour, corn meal, water and salt to make a
  thin batter.  Let sit for at least 10 minutes. Dip pieces of seitan
  into batter. Pan fry in oil on both sides until brown.
  
  Combine topping ingredients together in a blender and blend until
  smooth. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Pour 1 cup sauce into a 9" x
  13" baking dish, distributing evenly. Place batter fried seitan on
  top. Spread onions on top of seitan.  Pour on remaining sauce and top
  with tofu topping. Bake for 30 minutes.
  
  This is a fairly close approximation to what a parmigiana dish should
  be like.  It is based on the mushroom stroganoff from the American
  Vegetarian Cookbook, and comes from Renee Wheeler.

      Title: SEITAN POSOLE STEW
 Categories: Vegetarian, Stews, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Stew
 
      1 c  Dried posole or canned
           -hominy
           4-8 cups of water
      1 ts Sea salt
      1 ea Bay leaf
      3 ea Dried chipotle chiles
      1 tb Chili powder (optional)
      2 tb Corn or olive oil
      1 tb Whole cumin seed
      1 ea Onion, finely diced
      5 cl Garlic, minced
    1/2 c  Chopped jalapeno peppers
      2 c  Cooked seitan, cubed
      1 tb Mexican oregano
      1 ts Sage
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
 
  To prepare posole: rince dried posole and soak overnight (or up to 24
  hours).  Rince and place in heavy pot with enough water to cover.
  Bring to a boil, then add sea salt, chipolte chiles and bay leaf.
  Cook for 3-4 hours, until tender, adding water as necessary. You can
  also pressure cook posole for one hour and simmer for an additional
  hour. The goal is to have the posole kernels split open and tender in
  a gently flavored broth.
  
  To prepare stew: saute cumin, onions, garlic and jalapenos in oil
  with a pinch of sea salt.  When cumin is fragent and onions are
  translucent, add seitan cubes and continue to saute until seitan is
  seared. Add oregano and sage and saute for one more minute. Add
  mixture to posole and continue to cook for one hour. Taste and adjust
  seasonings about ten minutes before finishing.  Add lime juice 5
  minutes before finishing. Garnish with chopped tomatoes, avocado and
  cilantro. Serve with warm tortillas.
  
  Cook's note: when using canned posole or hominy, pre-soak the
  chipotles and chop finely before adding with bay leaf and salt. Cook
  for one hour before proceeding with the stew directions.

      Title: SELECTING & USING OTHER CHINESE COOKING UTE
 Categories: Info/tips, Wok
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients
 
  While it is not absolutely essential to purchase a lot of exotic
  Chinese implements for one's kitchen, the author recommends the
  purchase of a good Chinese cleaver. Like the wok, the Chinese cleaver
  has been known in China for centuries. There are several types of
  Chinese cleavers on the market. Most of the ones that are available
  at department stores or Chinese shops are made of mild steel with
  either metal or wooden handles. There are ones with 1 1/2" of blade
  width, others up to 4" blade width. If one wishes to spend the money,
  it is best to purchase a Chinese cleaver with a 1 1/2" blade for
  slicing vegetables and another 4" blade one for all purpose work. If
  one is living on a strict budget and can only afford one knife, it is
  best to purchase the Chinese cleaver with the 4" blade. In both cases
  choose knives with blades that can be readily honed to sharpness.
  There are some Chinese cleavers on the market which have thick
  blades. These are used for mincing meats or for heavy duty chopping.
  It is well to buy one of these also, if you already own the above
  mentioned two.
  
  There are Chinese cleavers made of stainless steel. These are more
  expensive and are rather difficult to hone to razor sharpness. For
  these reasons, they are not as popular as ones made with mild steel.
  
  Your Chinese cleaver should be washed and dried with a paper towel. It
  should be kept as sharp as possible at all times because Chinese
  cookery requires that most foods be either sliced, diced, shredded,
  or minced. A knife steel (which can be purchased from most restaurant
  supply houses) or a fine whetstone is used to keep knives sharp. In
  sharpening the Chinese cleaver, one should alternate the blade
  surface as one is honing it against the whetstone. A daily honing of
  ten or twelve strokes is not too much for your Chinese cleaver. Do,
  however, store your Chinese cleaver carefully in a drawer so that the
  blade side is down. Otherwise one could accidentally cut oneself when
  opening the drawer, if the blade of the cleaver is facing upwards.
  
  In order to use the Chinese cleavers or for that matter, any other
  groups of sharp knives efficiently, one must definitely have a good
  cutting board. Breadboards may be used. The only problem with a
  breadboard is that it is likely to crack if one uses it for mincing
  meat upon it, Chinese style! If one can afford one, it is best to get
  a thick, cross-grained laminated hardwood meat board. They cost more
  but are very durable and will not splinter.
  
  As mentioned earlier, they only other essential piece of equipment
  that one needs for good Chinese cooking, is a pot for cooking rice.
  Any pot with a tight fitting cover can be used. If you are cooking a
  small amount of rice, a small one or two quart pot will do. Most
  Chinese people prefer to use a heavy gauge pot for cooking rice. The
  author has taught students to cook rice successfully in stainless
  steel copper bottom pots, as well as clear glassy pyrex pots. The
  chief requirement for a good rice pot is that it has a well fitting
  tight cover, so that the rice can be properly steamed in it during
  its cooking process. Automatic rice cookers are marvelous inventions
  for anyone who eats rice very frequently. In addition to cooking
  perfect rice every time, an automatic rice cooker does not cause a
  crust of hard browned rice to form at the bottom of the pot. Some
  people discard this rice thereby creating wastage. There isn't any
  wastage with an automatic rice cooker. However some gourmets prefer
  the first mentioned method of cooking rice, appreciating the delicate
  toasted flavour that is imparted to the rice from the resulting
  crust. The author has included instructions for cooking perfect white
  rice in an ordinary pot at the end of the introductory section of
  this booklet.
  
  Chopsticks are so inexpensive that it is well to buy at least a dozen
  pairs. They are usually sold in packages of ten pairs. Besides using
  them for eating at the table, many Chinese cooks use them for
  stir-frying or for mixing ingredients. They can be used in lieu of a
  fork or slotted spoon. They are especially useful for picking out
  ingredients, either in cooking or in eating.
  
  Currently there are some non-warp wood chopsticks coming from The
  People's Republic of China on the market. If one cooks a great deal
  with chopsticks, one might want to purchase a pair of long wooden
  chopsticks expressly for this purpose. Due to prolonged use in
  stir-frying in the wok, the tips of the chopsticks acquire a burnt
  appearance and, therefore, become unattractive for table settings.
  
  There are also plastic and ivory chopsticks, if one desired fancier
  chopsticks for setting the table. However, food does have a tendancy
  to slide off them and, therefore, more people prefer wooden
  chopsticks.

      Title: SELECTING A WOK

           No ingredients
 
  Because there are many types of woks available for sale on the
  market, the novice wok cook should make some distinction among them.
  Some woks are sold individually while others are sold as sets with
  lids, rings, etc. The materials that woks are made of are spun sheet
  steel, hand hammered iron (low carbon steel), and stainless steel.
  There are also teflon coated electric woks. For the beginner, the
  author recommends that he purchase a wok set with lid, ring, wok
  turner, ladle, and strainer. A wok made of low carbon steel is
  preferred are this type of metal is a better conductor of heat. If
  one is concerned with appearance, a stainless steel wok is
  recommended. It can be scoured with steel wool and restored to
  newness after each use. Because stainless steel is a relatively poor
  conductor of heat and tends to reflect the heat back to the stove, it
  is recommended that a stainless wok be chosen with a slightly
  flattened bottom, to provide greater contact with the heating element
  of an electric stove.
  
  Regardless of the type of wok that one selects, one should consider
  the concaveness of a wok. There are shallow concave woks and deep
  concave woks. The best wok shape is a medium concave wok. If a wok is
  too deep then the heat of it will be mostly concentrated in the
  bottom of it and not enough on the sides. If the wok is too shallow,
  again, only the center of it will be heated and sides hardly at all.
  For the same reasons of heat conductivity, a thicker gauge wok is
  preferred to a thin metal wok.

      Title: SELECTING THE CORRECT PROCESSING TIME (PART 1
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  When canning in boiling water, more processing time is needed for most
  raw-packed foods and for quart jars than is needed for hot-packed
  foods and pint jars.
  
  To destroy microorganisms in acid foods processed in a boiling-water
  canner, you must:
  
  * Process jars for the correct number of minutes in boiling water. *
  Cool the jars at room temperature.
  
  The food may spoil if you fail to add process time for lower
  boiling-water temperatures at altitudes above 1,000 feet, process for
  fewer minutes than specified, or cool jars in cold water.
  
  To destroy microorganisms in low-acid foods processed with a pressure
  canner, you must:
  
  * Process the jars using the correct time and pressure specified for
  your altitude.
  
  * Allow canner to cool at room temperature until it is completely
  depressurized.
  
  The food may spoil if you fail to select the proper process times for
  specific altitudes, fail to exhaust canners properly, process at lower
  pressure than specified, process for fewer minutes than specified, or
  cool the canner with water.
