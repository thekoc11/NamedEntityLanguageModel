                        --reserve liquid
   6      cups          reduced-sodium chicken broth -- defatted
                        salt & freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
   8      large         shrimp -- optional
                        --1/2 pound
   2      tablespoons   snipped fresh chives
                        --or slivered basil leaves
                        garlic crostini
                        --see recipe

1. Preheat oven to 225°F. Lightly oil a large baking sheet with sides or coat it with nonstick spray.

2. Cut fresh tomatoes in half lengthwise. Arrange, cut-side down, in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with sugar. Roast for 3 hours, or until very soft and wrinkled. Let cool and set aside.

3. Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven or soup pot, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil and dried chilies (or crushed red pepper) over medium-low heat. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add paprika and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute more.

4. Add canned tomatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.

5. Strain soup into a bowl; transfer solids to a food processor or blender. Puree until smooth, adding a little broth if necessary. Return puree and broth to pot. Whisk to combine.

6. Using a food mill, puree reserved roasted tomatoes. (Alternatively, slip off skins, puree in a food processor and strain through a coarse sieve.) Add puree to soup. (If the soup is too thick, add a little of the reserved canned tomato liquid.) Season with salt and pepper.

7. If using shrimp, cook in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until they just turn pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and let cool. Peel shrimp and cut in half lengthwise.

8. Ladle into warmed soup bowls and garnish with shrimp, if using, and chives (or basil). Serve immediately, with Garlic Crostini.

   2 1/2  pounds        beef stew meat
                        --cut into 1-inch cubes

   1      tablespoon    minced garlic
     1/2  pound         mushrooms -- quartered
  14      ounces        tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
     1/2  cup           beef stock
   1      tablespoon    worcestershire sauce
   2                    bay leaves
   1 1/2  teaspoon      dried oregano

                        salt -- to taste

1. Coarsely chop 4 potatoes. Place chopped and whole potatoes, beef, onions, garlic, mushrooms, tomatoes, beef stock, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, oregano and mustard in pressure cooker. Stir well to blend, making sure that some of the liquid has seeped down to the bottom. Lock the lid in place and, over high heat, bring to high pressure.

2. Adjust heat to maintain high pressure; cook for 16 minutes. Let pressure drop naturally about 10 minutes. Do not use a quick-release method. Remove lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. Test beef for doneness. If it is not sufficiently tender, lock lid back into place and return to high pressure a few more minutes. Let pressure drop naturally.

3. Stir in the green beans and parsley. Add salt and pepper to taste, and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until green beans are cooked, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove bay leaves and adjust seasonings.

Makes 6 servings. Preparation Time: About 20 minutes. Cooking Time: About 25 minutes.

4. In a Dutch oven or wide soup pot, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Add bell peppers, onions, garlic and saffron. Cook, stirring, until onions are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. (Add a little water if needed.) Add tomato paste and 1/4 cup water. Cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has been absorbed.

5. Add tomatoes, chickpeas, reserved eggplant, thyme, remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 cups water. Reduce heat to low and simmer, partly covered, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened and vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3      large   whol  heads garlic
   2      tablespoons   water -- plus
   2 3/4  cups          water
   6      large         yellow bell peppers
   3      medium        onions -- sliced

                        salt & freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
                        basil cream -- see recipe

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly oil 2 baking sheets with sides, or coat them with nonstick spray.

2. Full papery husks off garlic. Slice the tip off each head to expose cloves. Place on a square of aluminum foil and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons water. Pinch edges of foil together to seal.

3. Stem, halve and seed bell peppers. Arrange cut-side down, along with garlic packet, on 1 prepared baking sheet. On the other, toss onions with oil and spread evenly over baking sheet.

4. In upper third of oven, roast bell peppers and garlic for 30 to 45 minutes, or until pepper skins blacken and garlic is tender. In lower third of oven, roast onions for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until golden. Let cool.

5. Remove skins from bell peppers and squeeze garlic flesh from skins. In a blender or food processor, puree bell peppers, onions and garlic until smooth. (Add some of the remaining 2 3/4 cups water if necessary.) Strain through a fine sieve into a large saucepan. Add remaining water and bring to a simmer over low heat. Season with salt and pepper. (The soup will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat before serving.)

6. Ladle into warmed soup bowls; swirl with basil cream. Serve immediately.

1. In a bowl of cold water, soak corn for 30 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, in a large pot, combine 7 cups water, wine, bay leaf and 1 leek; bring to a boil. Add lobsters and cover. Cook until lobsters turn bright red, about 10 minutes. Transfer lobsters to a cutting board. Reserve liquid.

3. Twist off lobster tails and claws. Using kitchen shears, cut underside of tail shells in half; pull out meat. Crack claws with a nutcracker or hammer and remove meat. Cut lobster meat into 1/2-inch pieces. Place in a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Return shells to liquid.

4. Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill.

6. Husk corn and cut kernels from cobs. Add to reserved lobster meat. Add husks and cobs to reserved liquid.

7. Remove skins from tomatoes and add skins to reserved liquid along with half of the onion. Coarsely chop tomato flesh, grilled leek and remaining onion half and place in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate.

8. Bring cooking liquid to a boil over high heat. Cook until reduced to 4 cups, 25 to 30 minutes. Pour through a fine sieve into a 4-quart pot. Add reserved tomato mixture, potatoes, salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

9. Add reserved lobster and corn, reduce heat to low and simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir m basil. Serve in wide soup bowls, passing hot sauce separately.
