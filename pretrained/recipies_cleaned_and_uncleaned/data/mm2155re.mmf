  or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef.
  This is best using both ground pork and ground beef,
  as the pork gives more flavor diversity. However, you
  can make it with ground beef only. From Paul

  The bacon drippings are for browning the chicken.
  The 20 lbs of chicken should be cut up in 2-inch-long
  pieces. Justin likes more wine in this sauce than some
  peoples.  If you don't wish to use all 8 Cups of
  Chablis in the sauce, feel free to drink what the
  sauce don't take.  Make sure you taste your sauce as
  you add the wine.  Me, I likes it.  My wife, she
  don't. Make a roux.  (see the recipe for Justin
  Wilson's roux, also posted here).  Add onions, bell
  pepper, green onions, and celery and saute until
  onions are tender and clear.  Add parsley and garlic
  and saute. Brown off chicken while roux is being made.
   After onions, etc. are tender, add water to bring
  roux to a smooth paste.  Add all other ingredients and
  enough water to cover well.  Bring to a boil, and then
  cut heat.  Cook for about 4 to 6 hours. Serve over
  spaghetti.  This is for a party and will serve 20 to
  40 people.  You can freeze what you don't eat. From

  Fill a large (10-quart) stockpot one-third full with
  water. Add the lemons, potatoes, corn, onions, salt,
  and peppers. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.
   Let boil for 10 minutes. Add the crabs, (if blue

     Title: Smothered Round Steak
Categories: Cajun Main dish Meats   
  Servings:  4

      2 lb Round steak
      2 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Ground black pepper
      1 t  Ground red pepper
      1 t  Ground white pepper
      1 x  All-purpose flour (dredging)
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      3 ea Medium onions, chopped
      2 ea Bell peppers, chopped
      1 ea Celery rib, chopped
      1 c  Beef stock or water

  Alex Patout says, "Smothering is a multipurpose Cajun
  technique that works wonders with everything from game
  to snap beans.  It's similar to what the rest of the
  world knows as braising--the ingredients are briefly
  browned or sauteed, then cooked with a little liquid
  over a low heat for a long time." Season the roast
  with one half of the salt and peppers.  Dust with
  flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or
  other large heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the
  steak, and brown well on all sides.  Remove the meat
  and pour off all but 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Add half
  the onions, bell peppers, celery, and the other half
  of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well
  and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point.
   Return the roast to the pot and cover with the
  remaining vegetables.  Cover and let cook until the
  meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
  Serve the meat in slices, with rice alongside and the
  gravy over all.
  When you try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be
  sure to adjust the cooking times accordingly--let
  tenderness be your guide. For extra flavorful roasts,
  try larding with slivers of garlic before smothering.

     Title: Blackened Redfish
Categories: Cajun Main dish Fish   
  Servings:  6

      6 ea 8-10oz redfish fillets
    3/4 lb Unsalted butter, melted
-----------------------SEASONING MIX-----------------------
      1 T  Sweet paprika
  2 1/2 t  Salt
      1 t  Onion powder
      1 t  Garlic powder
      1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
    3/4 t  Ground white pepper
    3/4 t  Ground black pepper
    1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves
    1/2 t  Dried oregano leaves

  NOTE: Fish fillets (preferably redfish, pompano or
  tilefish) cut about 1/2 inch thick.  Redfish and
  pompano are ideal for this method of cooking.  If
  tilefish is used, you may have to split the fillets in
  half horizontally to have proper thickness.  If you
  can't get any of these fish, salmon steaks or red
  snapper fillets can be substituted.  In any case, the
  fillets or steaks must not be more than 3/4 inch thick.
  Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat
  until it is beyond the smoking stage and you see white
  ash in the skillet bottom (the skillet cannot be too
  hot for this dish), at least 10 minutes.  (FT - this
  recipe is *NOT* for the faint of heart)    Meanwhile,
  pour 2 Tablespoons melted butter in each of 6 small
  ramekins; set aside and keep warm.  Reserve the
  remaining butter in its skillet.  Heat the serving
  plates in a 250F oven.    Thoroughly combine the
  seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl. Dip each
  fillet in the reserved melted butter so that both
  sides are well coated; then sprinkle seasoning mix
  generously and evenly on both sides of the fillets,
  patting by hand.  Place in the hot skillet and pour 1
  teaspoon melted butter on top of each fillet (be
  careful, as the butter may flame up).  Cook,
  uncovered, over the same high heat until the underside
  looks charred, about 2 minutes (the time will vary
  according to the fillet's thickness and the heat of
  the skillet).  Turn the fish over and again pour 1
  teaspoon butter on top; cook until fish is done, about
  2 minutes more.  Repeat with remaining fillets.  Serve
  each fillet while piping hot.
     To serve, place one fillet and a ramekin of butter
  on each heated serving plate.
  I had this in K Pauls Restaurant in New Orleans.  It
  is a taste experience you will never forgive yourself
  for missing should you ever be lucky enough to find
  yourself in N'awlins and you don't go to K Paul's and

  dish. From Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen,

      6 ea 1-3/4" thick pork chops
    3/4 lb Ground pork
      1 c  Chopped onions
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers
      2 t  Minced garlic
      1 cn (4 oz) diced green chilies
      1 c  Pork or chicken stock
    1/2 c  Very fine bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Finely chopped green onions

  In a food processor or blender, process the apples, 4
  Tablespoons of the butter, the sugar, vanilla and
  nutmeg until smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Set aside.
    In a small bowl thoroughly combine the seasoning mix
  ingredients; set aside.
    Prepare the pork chops by cutting a large pocket (to
  the bone) into the larger side of each chop to hold
  the stuffing.   In a large skillet, brown the ground
  pork in the remaining 3 Tbsp. butter over high heat,
  about 3 minutes.  Add the onions, bell peppers,
  garlic, and 2 Tbsp. of the seasoning mix, stirring
  well; cook about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and
  scraping pan bottom well.  Stir in the green chilies
  and their juice and continue cooking until mixture is
  well browned, about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring
  occasionally and scraping the pan bottom as needed.
   Add the stock and cook 5 minutes, stirring
  frequently.  Stir in the bread crumbs and cook about 2
  minutes more, stirring constantly and scraping pan
  bottom as needed.  Remove from heat.
    Sprinkle the remaining seasoning mix evenly on both
  sides of the chops and inside the pockets, pressing it
  in by hand.  Prop chops with pocket side up in an
  ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan.  Spoon about 1/4 cup
  stuffing into each pocket; reserve the remaining
  stuffing.  Bake chops with pocket up at 400F until the
  meat is done, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Place the
  remaining stuffing in a small pan in the oven for the
  last 20 minutes to reheat.   Serve immediately with
  each chop arranged on top of a portion of the
  remaining stuffing.

    1/4 c  Black pepper
    1/4 c  Garlic powder

      2 ea Onions, thinly sliced

      1 T  Plus 2 tsp, fennel seeds
      1 T  Plus 3/4 tsp, black pepper
  2 1/2 t  Dry mustard
  2 1/2 t  Ground cayenne pepper

  Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this
  for you) and save.  Place the roast, standing on the
  rib bones, in a very large roasting pan.  Then with a
  knife make several dozen punctures through the silver
  skin so seasoning can permeate meat.  Pour a very
  generous, even layer of black pepper over the top of
  the meat (the pepper should completely cover it);
  repeat with the garlic powder, then the salt, totally
  covering the preceding layer.  Carefully arrange the
  onions in an even layer on top so as not to knock off
  the seasoning.  Place the fat cap back on top.
   Refrigerate 24 hours. Bake ribs in a 550F oven until
  the fat is dark brown and crispy on top, about 35
  minutes.  Remove from oven and cool slightly.
   Refrigerate until well chilled, about 3 hours.  (this
  is done so the juices will solidify and the steaks can
  be cooked rare.)  Remove fat cap and disgard.  With
  the blade of a large knife, scrape off the onions and
  as much of the seasonings as possible and discard.
   Then with a long knife, slice between ribs into 6
  steaks (4 will have bones); trim the cooked surface of
  meat from the 2 pieces that were on the outside of the
  roast.  Season and cook in your favorite way for
  steaks. TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS:  Combine the
  ingredients of the seasoning mix thoroughly in a small
  bowl; you will have about 8 tablespoons. Sprinkle the
  steaks generously and evenly on both sides with the
  mix. using about 4 teaspoons on each steak and
  pressing it in with your hands.
  Heat a cast iron skillet over very high heat until it
  is beyond the smoking stage and you see white ash on
  the skillet bottom--at least 10 minutes.  (The skillet
  cannot be too hot for this method.)  Place one steak
  in the hot skillet (cook only one side at a time) and
  cook over a very high heat until the underside starts
  to develop a heavy, black crust, about 2 to 3 minutes.
   Turn the steak over and cook until the underside is
  crusted like the first, about 2 to 3 minutes more.
  Repeat with the remaining steaks.  Serve each steak
  while piping hot. (*NOTE*:  If you don't have a
  commercial hood vent over your stove, this dish may
  smoke you out of the kitchen.  It's worth it!  But you
  can also cook it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal
  fire doesn't get hot enough to "blacken" the steak
  properly.  If you have a smoke detector in your house,
  you will be able to determine if it is working
  correctly.  This is NOT a dish to prepare in an
  apartment building with a central fire alarm system
  wired into your smoke detector.  It causes great
  excitement!  Also, you can be guaranteed you will meet
  your landlord.) From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

  onions and cut light green and white part into 1"
  sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in 2-quart
  saucepan. Reserve.
  Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from
  bones.  Slice meat into 1" strips, then crosswise to
  make 1" chunks.  In bowl large enough to hold chicken,
  add egg white to water chestnut flour.  Beat mixture
  with a single chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk).
   Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat
  thoroughly.  Marinate 5 minutes.  Note: water chestnut
  flour gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though
  the latter may be substituted.
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to
  medium heat (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer).
   Fry peanuts until they are a light tan color; if a
  test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.  Remove
  peanuts with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper
  towel or paper bag. Reserve.
  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk
  first:  chicken should raise to surface immediately &
  brown in about 2 minutes.  Deep-fry coated chicken
  chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry no more than 8
  chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to
  keep pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove
  with long chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve. Sauce:
   While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add
  green onions & peanuts about a minute before serving.
   At the last minute, add chicken pieces to sauce, mix
  quickly & serve.

  ~----
  SELECTING THE RIGHT CHOCOLATE:  You'll find three
  basic types of chocolate in the baking supplies
  department of most supermarkets--semisweet chocolate,
  unsweetened chocolate, and sweet chocolate.  The
  semisweet chocolate is made from chocolate that is
  just slightly sweetened with sugar.  Unsweetened
  chocolate is the original baking or cooking chocolate
  and has no added flavorings or sugar.  And sweet
  chocolate, such as the German cooking chocolate used

  At bedtime make a batter of the half cup of starter,

  overnight if the biscuits are wanted for breakfast. If
  wanted for noon, the batter maybe mixed in the morning
  and set in a warm place to rise.  However, unless the
  weather is real warm, it is always all right to let it
  ferment overnight. It will get very light and bubbly.
  When ready to mix the biscuits, sift together the
  remaining cup and a half of flour and all other dry
  ingredients except the baking soda.  Work in the lard
  or shortening with your fingers or a fork.  Add baking
  soda dissolved in a little warm water to the sponge
  and then add the flour mixture. Mix into a soft dough.

  to about 1/2 inch thickness or a little thicker,and

     Title: Vegetable Soup
Categories: Soups Itali    
  Servings:  8

      8 c  Chicken broth (see recipe)
    1/3 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
      4 ea Garlic cloves
    1/4 lb Pancetta or unsmoked bacon
      3 c  Shredded cabbage
      1 ea Medium onion, finely chopped
      2 ea Carrots, finely chopped
      1 ea Celery stalk, finely chopped
      1 ea Potato, peeled, chopped
      2 ea Zucchini, finely chopped
      1 ea Large tomato, chopped
    1/4 lb Mushrooms, finely chopped
    1/4 lb String beans finely chopped
      4 ea Pieces prosciutto rind
      1 x  Salt, to taste
      1 x  Pepper, to taste
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese

  There are as many versions of vegetable soup in Italy
  as there there are cooks.
  Pancetta - Pancetta is the same cut of pork as bacon.
   It is cured with salt and is not smoked.  It comes
  rolled up like a large salami.  Widely used in Italian
  cooking, especially in Emilia-Romagna, it is vital to
  many dishes.  If available, buy a large quantity. Cut
  into several pieces and freeze it.  You can substitute
  domestic bacon for pancetta.  It must be blanched in
  boiling water for two three minutes to reduce the
  smoky flavour.  Fresh side pork can also be used.
   I'll be posting several recipes over the next while
  that call for pancetta, so if you can find some, it
  won't go to waste. Prepare chicken broth (see my
  previously posted recipe).  Heat oil in a large
  saucepan.  Add parsley and garlic.  Saute over medium
  heat.  Before garlic changes colour, add pancetta.
   Saute until lightly browned.  Stir in cabbage.  Cover
  and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining vegetables to
  saucepan.  Cover and cook about 5 minutes.  Add broth
  and water, if using, and prosciutto rind or ham shank.
   Cover and reduce heat.  Simmer 40 to 50 minutes.
   Remove half the vegetables with a slotted spoon.
   Place in a blender or food processor and process
  until smooth.  Return to saucepan. Season with salt
  and pepper.  Serve hot with Parmesan cheese sprinkled
  over top.  Makes 8 to 10 servings. VARIATION:
  Toast about 20 thick slices of Italian bread.  Place 2
  slices in each soup bowl and sprinkle generously with
  Parmesan cheese. Ladle soup into bowls.  Serve with
  additional Parmesan cheese.

     Title: Frances Cook's Bread & Rolls
Categories: Breads Londontowne    
  Servings: 24

    3/4 c  Milk
      1 ea Fresh cake yeast
    1/4 c  Sugar
      3 T  Shortening
      1 t  Salt
      1 ea Egg
  3 1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Lukewarm water

  Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, & salt.
  Let it cool to lukewarm while softening yeast in a
  small bowl with the warm water. When soft, add the egg
  and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg mixture
  into the milk mixture and stir them together.
  The flour may be sifted or poured into the liquid.
  With a large spoon, stir until flour/milk is well
  mixed. You should have a firm, but not stiff dough.
  Without removing it from the bowl, cover the dough
  with a plate or towel and set aside to rise until
  double in bulk (about 2 hrs depending on the
  temperature in the kitchen). Instead of letting the
  dough rise at this point you may put it in the
  refrigerator and use it later, or the next day. Watch
  to make sure it doesn't spill out of the bowl. If it
  starts to spill before you're ready to use it, punch
  it back down. Refrigerated dough is easier to handle
  but takes longer to rise.
  BREAD:
  If you want to make bread, dump the dough out of the
  bowl onto a floured surface and with more flour as
  needed to keep it from sticking, knead it until
  springy and easy to handle. This dough does not
  require a lot of kneading; only enough to make it easy
  to handle. For 2 medium size loaves cut the dough in
  half and knead/shape each into loaves and put into
  greased baking pans. Allow about 2 hours for the dough
  to double again. Bake in a 375 degree oven until
  lightly browned on top (if uncertain whether or not
  bread is done, tip out of pan and see if bottom is
  browned too).
  ROLLS:
  To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and
  easily handled. Roll out with a rolling pin and cut
  with a biscuit cutter and fold over and place on a
  greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse rolls), or break
  dough into small pieces, make into little balls and
  place 3 in each section of a greased muffin pan
  (Cloverleaf rolls).
  SWEET ROLLS:
  For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as
  for Parkerhouse rolls, except trying to make an oblong
  instead of a round. Spread it with raisins and
  sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Dot with butter and
  roll as for a jelly roll. Slice and place on a greased
  pan or make into a circle and make slashes through the
  dough at intervals. Let rise and bake as for loaves.
  Top with an icing made of confectioners' sugar, melted
  butter, milk, and vanilla or rum flavoring and drizzle
  over the bread or rolls while hot. Decorate with nuts
  or fruits.
  If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use half
  white and half whole wheat flour, and use brown sugar
  instead of white. The amounts above will yield 1 large
  or 2 medium loaves of bread, or 2 dozen large rolls.

     Title: Whole Wheat Batter Bread
Categories: Breads Londontowne    
  Servings:  1

      8 c  Whole wheat flour
      4 T  Honey-molasses
      3 T  Wheat germ
  3 1/2 c  Very warm water
      3 T  Soya flour
      3 c  Corn oil
      3 pk Yeast
      2 T  Salt

  This recipe is for 2 loaves of bread. If one loaf is
  desired, use 2 packages yeast instead of 3 and cut all
  other ingredients in half. Wheat germ and soya flour
  may be omitted. Put flour in oven to warm, at lowest
  heat. In a VERY large bowl, dissolve yeast in 3/4 cup
  of very warm water. Add honey to yeast. Coat loaf pans
  well with margarine and flour. Add oil, 2-1/2 cups
  warm water, and 2T salt yeast. Add about 4c flour
  mixture and beat at medium speed for 2 minutes.
  Gradually add more flour, beating well. Dough should
  be sticky - if runny, add more flour. Put in pans,
  smoothing top and making sure dough is pushed into
  corners. Cover with hot, wet towel and let rise in
  warm place. Check bread in about 20 minutes and keep
  checking to be sure dough doesn't rise over lip of
  pan. When dough has risen ALMOST to lip of pan, bake
  at 450 degrees for about 40 mins. Remove from pan
  immediately and cool on rack. Mrs. William W.

    1/2 pt Whipping cream

     Peel the onions.  Parboil in about 3/4 cup water.
   (I do this part    in a covered casserole in the
  microwave).  Make white sauce with    rest of
  ingredients.  If you like a stronger onion flavor,
  thin the    white sauce with part or all of the onion
  water.  Otherwise, thin it    with your choice of
  cream, milk, water, chicken broth or whatever
     flavor you like.  Add onions and bake at 325 to 350
  until bubbly. If    you're a real creamed onion pig

  layer on top, frost top and sides of cake with Fudge
  Icing and cover sides of cake with chopped cashews.
  FUDGE ICING:
  Bring cream to boil.  Stir in chocolate until melted
  and smooth. This will be very soft but will harden
  when cooled.  Refrigerate until workable consistency.
         NOTE: The time it takes to get to a workable
  consistency depends on the weather.  This is much like
  making fudge candy. The author, (Arlene Lightsey),
  made this sauce on a cool, clear day and had no
  problem. CARAMEL SAUCE:
  Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and reduce to thick
  syrup. Very carefully, (because it will splatter), add
  cream.  Refrigerate until cool. Recipe from Pastry

     Title: Piney Woods Hush Puppies
Categories: Breads Texas    
  Servings: 48

  2 1/2 c  Yellow Corn Meal
      1 t  Soda
      1 t  Salt
      2 T  Granulated Sugar
      2 T  All-Purpose Flour
      1 T  Baking Powder
      1 ea Egg, beaten
      2 c  Buttermilk
  1 1/2 c  Cooking Oil (about)

  Mix all dry ingredients; beat milk and egg together
  and combine with dry ingredients; batter should hold
  its shape when picked up in spoon. If it is too soft,
  add more cornmeal. Drop by molded Tablespoon into
  350"F fat and cook about 1 1/2 minutes; turn and cook
  on second side 1 minute. Allow oil to heat a few
  seconds after removing a batch. Delicious freshly
  cooked and hot; however, leftover hush puppies freeze
  well. When ready to serve frozen hush puppies, place
  on oven rack in preheated 250"F until very hot and
  crisp. Makes about 48 hush puppies 2" round. Hints on
  frying: Using a small diameter heavy saucepan allows
  using a minimum oil; a 5 or 6 inch pan with oil 1 1/2
  inches deep and heated to 350"F will cook three hush
  puppies in about 2 1/2 minutes. When batter
  consistency is correct and oil is at 350"F, hush
  puppies will become firm, round shapes almost as soon
  as they enter the hot oil. If they are cooked in oil
  that is too hot, they will not cook in the center.
  Serving suggestions: Especially good served with fried
  catfish, trout, shrimp, oysters, chicken or
  chicken-fried steak. Source: Texas Recipes from Texas

      1 x  Lemon Juice
      1 x  Beef Stock; OR
      1 x  Red Wine
      1 x  Minced Shallots

  NOTE:  This recipe is adjustable to all sizes of
  roasts.  This is the Marinate the meat for a couple of
  hours in a liquid that is slightly acidic--a liquid
  such as wine, beer, vinegar, or lemon juice.  Roast
  for 15 minutes per pound at 325 degrees F.  For the
  last 15 minutes, cook at 500 degrees F.  For example,
  for a 4 pound roast, total cooking time is 1 hour but
  it will be 45 minutes at 325 degrees F. and 15 minutes
  at 500 degrees F.  This will crust the outside of the
  roast and the inside will be medium, barely pink.
   This is based on room temperature meat.  If the meat
  is quite cold, extend the baking time.  After 3/4 of
  the cooking time, sprinkle with salt and some fresh or
  dry rosemary needles.  Turn the roast with WOODEN
  SPOONS (Very important that you do not pierce the
  meat) and season it all over.  Rosemary, seasoned salt
  or garlic salt are nice, and some freshly ground black
  pepper adds to the flavor also.  Swab the roast with
  some fresh lemon juice--this will also add to the zing
  of the meat.  When cooked, snip off the cords and
  slice to serve.  From the roasting pan, spoon off the
  fat from the accumulated juice.  Add some beef stock
  or red wine to the juices, a few minced shallots or
  green onion shreds and cook down at high heat to a
  reduction or concentrated sauce. Adjust the
  seasonings, salt, pepper, and herbs of your choice,
  and serve with the roast.

  over a piece of buttered bread and squeeze.  The
  garlic puree will pop out, like toothpaste from a
  tube.  Spread and eat. GARLIC PUREE:
  To make a batch of Garlic Puree for later use, let
  roasted heads of garlic cool, unwrapped for at least 5
  minutes. Gently separate the cloves and squeeze each
  one over a fine meshed sieve, so that the softened
  garlic pops into the sieve. With wooden spatula or
  wooden spoon, rub garlic through the sieve into a
  small container or bowl. Cover tightly with plastic
  wrap and refrigerate the puree if needed. QUICK PUREE:
  If you are in a hurry, you may skip the refinement of
  the sieve.  Simply squeeze the cloves, one by one,
  over a bowl.  When they have all been squeezed, use a
  rubber spatula to push the puree into a neat mound
  cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until
  needed.  It will keep for months.  To keep
  indefinitely, cover with a film of olive oil.

  Servings: 12

      1 pk Active Dry Yeast; OR
      1 tb Active Dry Yeast; Bulk
    1/4 c  Warm Water; (110-115 Deg F)
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 t  Salt
    1/3 c  Butter Or Regular Margarine
      1 tb Orange Juice
      2 t  Rum Extract
      1 c  Milk; Scalded
      1 x  Unbleached Flour; *
      2 ea Eggs; Lg, Well Beaten
      1 x  Fat For Deep Frying; **
      1 x  Jam Or Jelly

  *    Use up to 4 cups of Unbleached Flour in this
  recipe. **   Heat the fat to 375 degrees F. for frying
  the doughnuts. Soften the yeast in the warm water and
  let stand for 5 minutes or until it "blooms" or
  proofs.  Put a half cup of sugar, the salt, butter,
  orange juice and rum extract in a large bowl.  Pour
  the scalded milk over the ingredients in the bowl.
   Stir until the butter is melted.  Cool to lukewarm.
   When cool, blend in 1 cup of the unbleached flour and
  beat until smooth.  Stir in the yeast and add about
  half of the remaining flour, beating until smooth.
   Beat in the eggs.  Then beat in enough of the
  remaining flour to make a SOFT (should be slightly
  sticky and light in weight).  Turn the dough out onto
  a lightly floured board and let rest for 5 to 10
  minutes.  Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to
  10 minutes). Form into a ball and put into a greased
  bowl, turning to grease the top of the ball of dough.
   Cover and let rise in a warm draft free place until
  doubled in bulk.  Punch the dough down, kneading
  lightly to remove all of the air pockets, and turn the
  dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to
  1/2-inch thickness.  Cut the dough into rounds using a
  3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter.  Cover with waxed
  paper and let rise on the rolling surface away from
  drafts and direct heat, until double in bulk, (30 to
  45 minutes).  About 20 minutes before frying, heat the
  fat.  Fry the doughnuts in the heated fat.  Put only
  as many doughnuts at one time as will float uncrowded
  in a single layer deep in the fat.  Fry 2 to 3 minutes
  or until lightly browned; turn the doughnuts with a
  fork or tongs, being careful not to pierce the
  doughnut, when they rise to the surface. Do this
  several times during the cooking.  Lift from the fat,
  draining for a few seconds over the fat before
  removing to absorbent paper toweling. Cool.  Cut a
  slit through the center in the side of each doughnut.
   Force about 1/2 ts of jam or jelly into the center
  and press lightly to close the slit.  (A pastry bag
  and tube may be used to force the jelly or jam into
  the slit.)  Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at one time in a bag
  containing granulated or powdered sugar.  (Your
  choice.)  Shake lightly to remove the excess sugar.

     Title: Basic Divinity
Categories: Candies     
  Servings:  6

      2 c  White Sugar; Granulated
    1/2 c  Light Corn Syrup
    1/2 c  Water
      1 pn Salt (1/8 tsp)
      2 ea Egg Whites; Lg
      1 t  Vanilla Extract
      1 c  Nuts; Chopped, OR
      1 c  Cherries; Chopped, OR
      1 c  Orange Peels; Chopped, Etc.

  ~------------------------------OPTIONALS
  ~-------------------------------- NOTE:  TO PREWARM A
  CANDY THERMOMETER, SIMPLE PLACE IT AN A SMALL SAUCE
  PAN OF COLD WATER AND BRING IT TO A BOIL.  LET IT
  SIMMER UNTIL YOU NEED THE THERMOMETER.
  STEP 1:  Prewarm the thermometer; separate the eggs
  allowing the whites to come to room temperature in a
  large bowl of an electric mixer.  (Return the egg
  yolks to the refrigerator covering with plastic wrap
  or water for another recipe.)  Fill a glass with ice
  cubes and water.  To make dropped divinities, you will
  need 2 cookie sheets, topped with greased wax paper.
  For squares, use a greased and wax paper-lined 8 X
  8-inch pan.  Measure the sugar, corn syrup, ice water
  and salt and dump into a heavy 2-quart saucepan with a
  tight fitting lid. STEP 2:  Dissolve the sugar,
  stirring constantly with a wooden spoon over low heat.
   Syrup will become clear, gritty sounds will cease,
  and the spoon will glide smoothly over the bottom of
  the pan.  Increase the heat to medium and bring to a
  boil. STEP 3:  (OPTIONAL):  Cover pan with a square of
  wax paper and lid, pushing down firmly.  Steam for 2
  to 3 minutes to dissolve the sugar crystals.  (Listen
  to make sure the pot doesn't boil over.  To
  double-check, remove lid, leaving the wax paper in
  place.) STEP 4:  Wash down any crystals clinging to
  the sides with a brush dipped in hot water from the
  thermometer bath.  Introduce the prewarmed
  thermometer.  No need to stir. STEP 5:  Beat the egg
  whites until stiff but not dry.  If your mixer is a
  heavy duty one, you can wait until the bubbles in the
  syrup become very large and airy before beating the
  egg whites.  Otherwise, do it now when the thermometer
  registers 240 Degrees F. (115.5 C.). STEP 6:  Test the
  syrup when the thermometer registers 246 degrees F.
  (119 C.).  Continue testing until it reach the
  firm-ball stage, 246 to 260 degrees F. (119 to 126.5
  C.).  Syrup will be hard to scrape up in ice water.
   It will have to be forced into a ball, but once
  formed, it should hold its shape but give under
  pressure.  Return the thermometer to the hot water
  bath to soak clean. STEP 7:  Dribble the syrup into
  the egg whites in a slow, steady stream, beating at
  slow speed.  Tilt the syrup pan to get the last drop
  but do not scrape the pan.  Once the syrup is
  completely incorporated, change to a flat whip if you
  have one. STEP 8:  Have patience and continue beating.
   The amount of time you spend mixing depends on the
  power of your mixer.  If you have a heavy duty or
  commercial one, you can go to full speed and make the
  divinity in less than 5 minutes.  With less powerful
  ones, it can take up to 20 minutes. The important
  thing is to beat at the highest speed of your mixer.
   Also if it is a hot and humid day, it will take
  longer also. STEP 9:  Test the divinity.  The first
  and most important test occurs when you lift the
  beaters.  If the candy falls back in ribbons that
  immediately merge back into the batter, it isn't done.
   Eventually, a stationary column will form between the
  beaters and the bowl.  Candy will lose its sheen/gloss
  and stop being sticky; a teaspoonful dropped onto wax
  paper will hold its shape, even a peak.  If you
  machine is laboring and the candy is not quite there
  yet, you have two choices: Pour anyway and put into a
  frost free freezer to set up....or finish by hand.
  STEP 10:  Fold in the flavorings and nuts and/or other
  optional items using the mixer or if very thick, a
  wooden spoon. STEP 11:  Drop or spread the divinity
  either on wax paper-covered cookie sheets or the
  buttered pan.  Dripping it by teaspoon is harder work
  for you but it ripens quicker and is ready to eat
  sooner.  A neat trick is to put the candy into a
  pastry bag and pipe onto the wax paper.  If you spread
  it in the pan, you will have to wait up to 24 hours
  before it is ready.  But you maybe one of those that
  think it is better when it is 24 hours old.  Score and
  cut into squares.  Store in an airtight container at
  room temperature or in a refrigerator. Makes 1 pound
  but looks like more.  Recipe CANNOT be doubled; it can
  be frozen but not for extended periods of time.

      2 pk Inst choc-fudge pudding(4oz)
      3 c  Milk
     12 oz Whipped topping,1 tub thawed

  This is a joke, a bit of whimsy to lighten up your
  next party. The cake is really a quick mix dessert
  made with Oreo cookies and soft squishy stuff. The
  trick is to capture everyone's attention with an
  announcement of some sort, and as you are speaking,
  trowel out some of the dirt from the flower pot around
  the flowers and eat it. May be followed by a worm dug
  out of the "dirt". You may substitute vanilla pudding
  for the chocolate if you want, and use up to 20 oz of
  Oreos. Please use a clean new plastic flower pot or
  take the precaution of lining a clay pot with foil and
  wrap the stems of live flowers if you use them in
  order to prevent any toxins from entering the dessert.
    Crush the cookies until they resemble potting soil.
   Set aside.   Cream the butter or margarine, cream
  cheese, sugar  and vanilla until smooth and fluffy.
   Set aside.  Combine the pudding mix and milk until
  well blended.  Then fold in the whipped topping.
   Gently fold the cream cheese and pudding mixtures
  together.   To put the "cake" together, layer
  one-third of the cookie crumbs followed by 1/2 of the
  pudding mixture, 1/3 of the crumbs, the rest of the
  pudding mixture and topping with the balance of the
  crumbs.   Refrigerate 10-12 hours before serving.
   Remove from refrigerator, decorate with flowers.
   Serve by digging out portions with the trowel.
   Serves 10 to 12.

      3 ea Stalks of Celery
      1 ea Large Onion, sliced
      4 ea Sprigs of Dill
    1/4 t  Pepper

  Food writer Norene Gilletz has adapted her
  grandmother's chicken soup recipe for cooking by
  microwave. In a soup kettle, combine chicken and
  salted water. Bring to a boil. Skim surface. Add
  carrots, celery, onion, dill and pepper to the hot
  broth. Cover and simmer until meat is tender and
  vegetables are cooked -- about two hours. Strain and
  refrigerate. Remove the fat that congeals on top and
  discard. Serve soup with noodles or rice, cooked
  separately or in the strained broth.
  Microwave method: Gilletz prefers this method, because
  all the ingredients and can be added at once and there
  is no need to skim the broth. In a bowl, pour boiling
  water over chicken. Trim off excess fat. Place chicken
  in a five-quart microwave-safe casserole. Cut carrots
  and celery into chunks. Add to chicken along with
  onion, dill and seasonings. cover with water. To
  prevent boiling over, take care water remains 1 1/2
  inches below top of the casserole. Cover casserole and
  microwave at high (100 %) power for 30 - 35 minutes or
  until soup is boiling. Stir. Simmer at medium power
  for 25 - 30 minutes. Let stand covered for 15 - 20
  minutes. Strain soup. Serve as above.

   Rinse once more in cold water before cooking.
    3.  Add four quarts of cold water to a kettle and

  Cook the snails in advance in a court bouillon, then

  court bouillon is an aromatic liquid or stock,
  sometimes containing wine, vinegar or lemon juice,
  used mainly for cooking fish and shellfish, but also
  sometimes white offal (variety meats) and some white
  meats.  -- mkm]  Chop them, together with the peeled
  shallots and a small bunch of well-washed chives.
   Place these ingredients in a saucepan with the wine,
  cover and simmer for 1 hour. Meanwhile, soak the
  frogs' legs in the milk for 1 hour.  Drain them, then
  roll in flour and saute in the butter in a frying pan
  over a brisk heat for 10 minutes.  Add the snails,
  together with their cooking juices, and season with
  salt and pepper.  [Personally, I prefer to mill the
  pepper at the dinner table.  The smell of the freshly

     Title: Brown Sugar Fudge (Penuche)
Categories: Candies     
  Servings:  6

      1 c  White Sugar; Granulated
      1 c  Light Brown Sugar; Firm Pack
    1/2 c  Heavy (Whipping) Cream
      3 tb Molasses; *
      2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate; 2 Sqs
      4 tb Butter; 1/2 stick
  1 1/2 t  Vanilla
    1/2 c  Chopped Nuts; Optional

  *    This is to taste.  The original recipe called for
  4 Tbls of Molasses, STEP 1:  PREPARE:
  Prewarm the thermometer in hot water; use a 2-quart
  saucepan; butter the upper sides (inside) of the
  saucepan; measure all ingredients except the vanilla
  and optionals, and dump into the saucepan.  Grease and
  if necessary, line a 5 X 10-inch pan.  Fill glass with
  ice cubes and water and the sink with 1/2 inch of cold
  water. STEP 2:
  Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden
  spoon, over low heat until the butter melts, the
  gritty sounds cease, and the spoon glides smoothly
  over the bottom of the pan.  Increase the heat to
  medium and bring to a boil.
  STEP 3:
  Boil, after washing down any crystals that may have
  formed, with a pastry brush dipped in hot water from
  the thermometer bath, using as little water as
  possible.  Introduce the prewarmed thermometer.
   Reduce the heat while keeping the fudge at a boil.
   Stir no more than necessary. STEP 4:
  Test the fudge mixture in the ice-cold water when the
  mixture thickens and bubbles become noisy.  Ball,
  formed in ice water, should hold its shape until the
  heat from your had begins to flatten it and should be
  al dente -- slightly chewy -- between 230 and 240 (110
  and 115.5 degrees C.). Because of the molasses and
  brown sugar, it can ball at a lower temperature than
  some other fudges. STEP 5:
  Shock by placing the saucepan in the cold water in the
  sink. STEP 6:
  Seed by adding, without stirring, the vanilla.  Then
  allow to cool. STEP 7:
  Stir when luke warm and "skin" forms on the top (110
  degrees F.(43.5 degrees C.)).  Return the thermometer
  to its hot water bath to soak clean. Stir the fudge
  thoroughly but not vigorously by hand, with an
  electric mixer, or with a food processor.  Pause
  frequently to allow the fudge to react.
  STEP 8:
  Watch for the fudge to thicken, lose its sheen, and
  become lighter in color or streaked with lighter
  shade, give off some heat, suddenly stiffen.  If
  mixing by had, the fudge will "snap" with each stroke;
  by mixer, mixer waves will become very distinct, by
  food processor, fudge will flow sluggishly back to the
  center when the processor is stopped. STEP 9:
  Add the optionals (1/2 Cup Chopped Nuts (walnuts,
  pecans, or hazelnuts (filberts)) before the fudge
  totally candies. STEP 10:
  Pour, score, and store when cool in an airtight
  container in the refrigerator or at room temperature.
  YIELD:  1 pound of fudge.  Recipe is easily doubled
  and can be frozen. VARIATIONS:
  HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eleminate the
  unsweetened chocolate and replace the molasses with
  1/4 cup of honey.  The honey causes the fudge to ball
  at a higher temperature. CHOCOLATE HONEY BROWN SUGAR
  FUDGE:  In Step 1, replace the heavy cream with light
  cream or evaporated milk and replace the molasses with
  1/4 cup of honey.
  ORANGE BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eleminate
  molasses, chocolate but add 1 Tbl corn syrup.  In Step
  6, add 1 Tbl grated orange zest, plus if you can get
  it, 1 tsp of pure orange extract. PEANUT BUTTER BROWN
  SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eliminate the molasses and
  chocolate, replace the heavy cream with 1/4 cup of
  milk and 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter.  To
  intensify the peanut butter flavor, add 1/3 of a cup
  of salted peanuts in Step 9. PRALINE BROWN SUGAR
  FUDGE:  In Step 1, eliminating the molasses is
  optional -- you'ss get a more Southern praline with
  it, a milder one without it--or compromise and use
  only 1 Tbls.  Eliminate the chocolate. In Step 3, when
  the mixture begins to thicken, add 1 1/2 cups of pecan
  halves slowly so as not to break the boil or cool the
  mixture too quickly.

      2 tb Salad Oil
      3 tb Butter
      1 ea Large Spanish Onion, chopped
      1 ea Egg, hard-cooked, mashed
      1 x  Salt
      1 x  Freshly Ground Pepper

  With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes
  from liver. In a heavy skillet, heat oil and add
  chopped onions. Cook over medium high heat until
  translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted
  spoon and set aside.
  Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver
  pieces. Over medium heat, fry liver until just done -
  3 minutes on each side. Alternatively, liver can be
  brushed with butter and broiled. To test for doneness,
  cut a piece from liver slice. If still pink, continue
  cooking for 30 - 60 seconds. Overcooking causes the
  liver to be dry and tough. For finely mashed egg that
  disappears in the liver mixture, force egg through a
  wire strainer. For best results, separate the hard
  cooked whites from yolks and sieve them separately.
  Set aside. Fit meat grinder with a medium blade and
  place cooked liver and cooked onions in the grinder.
  Grind, then regrind the ground mixture. In a medium
  mixing bowl, combine the twice ground meat and onions
  mixture with the sieved eggs. Add salt and pepper.
  Taste and adjust seasoning. If desired, add a few
  drops of commercial gravy browning liquid to heighten
  color. Refrigerate for 24 hours before serving. Serve
  with slices of tomato, cucumber and dark rye bread.

  cookie sheet. Flatten each with smooth bottom of a
  drinking glass greased once and dipped into Nestles'
  Quick Powder. (Or use sweetened chocolate drink
  powder).  Bake at 400 degrees for 8 minutes.  Remove
  cookies at once from baking sheet, to paper toweling

  turner.  Let cool 20 minutes.  Fill with COOKIE
  FILLING mixture. (Cookie Filling)
  Soften gelatin in cold water.  Place in heatproof cup
  in pan of hot water till gelatin is transparent.
   Meanwhile beat Crisco till fluffy, adding vanilla and
  sugar a little at a time.  Beat in Gelatin mixture
  when it is completely cooled, but not yet "set" or
  firm.  This is used to give the filling stability - as
  well as protein!  When cooled, shape filling into 1
  inch balls.  Place between the two bottom sides of the
  cooled cookies, pressing gently till filling has
  spread to edge of cookies and rounded-out like the
  originals. This is suppose to be a great imitation
  version of the original Nabisco Oreos.

  Now, I said above that this makes 48, I've never
  counted, so I don't know for sure.  But it sure does
  make a bunch.  The main reason why I said 48 is
  because the program, MenuMaster, won't let you past
  that field unless you tell it something. Justin Wilson
  says, "Hush puppy is an old Southern term that
  originated after the Civil War.  People didn't have
  enough for themselves to eat let alone feed their
  dogs, so when the old hounds started barking from
  hunger, they would throw pieces of fried corn bread to
  them, yelling, 'Shut up, dog!  Hush puppy!"

      2 T  (2 pk) Dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm Water (115-120 degrees)
  2 1/2 c  Warm Water
      2 T  Kosher Salt
  3 1/4 c  Whole Wheat Flour
  3 1/4 c  Unbleached All Purpose Flour
      1 x  Cornmeal

  Cream together the garlic puree and butter.  (This may
  be done days in advance and refrigerated.  Bring to
  room temperature before using). Combine the yeast with
  1/2 cup warm water in large bowl.  Stir with a fork or
  small whisk.  Add an additional 2 1/2 cups water.  Add
  salt.  Stir in the flour, 1 c at a time, beginning
  with the whole wheat.  Use a whisk until the dough
  becomes stiff, then switch to a wooden spoon.  Turn
  the dough onto a well floured work surface.  Knead
  rhythmically for 10 to 15 minutes, until the dough is
  smooth, springy, nonsticky, and elastic.  Add more
  flour as you knead if necessary.  The dough is ready
  if you can poke to fingers into it and the resulting
  indentations spring back.  Cover the dough with a
  cloth and let rest while you wash, dry and generously
  butter the bowl.  Knead the dough a few more turns,
  then form it into a ball and place it in the bowl.
   Turn it to coat with butter.  Cover the bowl and put
  it in a warm, draft-free place until the dough has
  doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.  It has risen
  sufficiently when you can gently poke a finger into
  the dough and the hole reamins.  (Don't poke too
  enthusiastically or the dough will collapse.)  When
  doubled, flour your fist and punch the dough down.
   Knead it a few times and then let it rest. Sprinkle 1
  large or 2 small baking sheets with a liberal amount
  of cornmeal.  Divide the dough into 3 equal parts.
   While you work with 1 piece, keep the other 2
  covered.  Flour your work surface.  With a rolling
  pin, roll each piece of dough into a rectangle
  approximately 14-inches long X 7-inches wide.  Spread
  it with softened garlic butter.  Roll the long edge
  toward the opposite long edge, as if you were rolling
  up a rug. Pinch ends closed.  Place loves on the
  baking sheets.  With a sharp knife or razor blade,
  slash the loves lightly at 2-inch intervals.  Cover
  with a cloth and place in a warm draft-free place to
  rise until doubled, about 1/2 hour.  Meanwhile preheat
  oven to 400 degrees F.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes with
  a pan of boiling water on the oven floor.  Spray
  loaves with water several times during the baking
  process.  (This helps the bread form a thick crusty
  shell.)  To test for doneness, rap the loaf with your
  knuckles.  The loaf should sound hollow.  Cool on wire
  racks, but the loaves are delicious eaten warm right
  out of the oven.

      3 ea Medium onions, chopped
      2 ea Bell peppers, chopped
      1 ea Celery rib, chopped
      1 c  Beef stock or water

  Alex Patout says, "Smothering is a multipurpose Cajun
  technique that works wonders with everything from game
  to snap beans.  It's similar to what the rest of the
  world knows as braising--the ingredients are briefly
  browned or sauteed, then cooked with a little liquid
  over a low heat for a long time." Season the roast
  with one half of the salt and peppers.  Dust with
  flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or
  other large heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the
  steak, and brown well on all sides.  Remove the meat
  and pour off all but 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Add half
  the onions, bell peppers, celery, and the other half
  of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well
  and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point.
   Return the roast to the pot and cover with the
  remaining vegetables.  Cover and let cook until the
  meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
  Serve the meat in slices, with rice alongside and the
  gravy over all.
  When you try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be
  sure to adjust the cooking times accordingly--let
  tenderness be your guide. For extra flavorful roasts,
  try larding with slivers of garlic before smothering.

Categories: Cajun Main dish Fish   
  Servings:  8

-----------------------FOR THE BOIL-----------------------
     40 lb Live crawfish
      1 c  Salt
    1/2 c  Ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Ground red pepper
    1/2 c  Ground black pepper
      5 lb Small white onions
     12 ea Ears of corn, shucked
      5 lb Small new potatoes
-------------------------SPRINKLE-------------------------
    1/2 c  Ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Ground red pepper
    1/2 c  Ground black pepper
      2 c  Salt

  Alex Patout describes Crawfish as "a delicacy made for
  sharing-- in fact, in Cajun country, boiling crawfish
  for only two people counts as a venial sin."
  Wash the crawfish well and pick out any fish bones or
  other debris.  Fill a great big (40-quart) Stockpot a
  quarter full of water.  Add the salt and peppers and
  bring to boil.  Add the whole onions, the corn, and
  the new potatoes (it will be easy to remove them later
  if you put them in a cloth sack).  Return to boil,
  cover, lower heat to medium, and let cook for 8
  minutes.  Add crawfish, cover again and raise heat to
  high.  After steam begins to escape from under the
  lid, cook 7 minutes more.  Remove from heat and let
  sit for 4 minutes.  Do *NOT* remove the lid until this
  point!     Remove the onions, corn, and potatoes to a
  bowl and drain the crawfish.  Place the crawfish in a
  large insulated container (an ce chest works well, as
  do the thick waterproof boxes chickens are shipped in,
  which your butcher may give you for free).  Have your
  *SPRINKLE* ready and sprinkle over the crawfish and
  mix them well to coat.  Cover and let sit for 7
  minutes.     Serve immediately with the onions, corn,
  new potatoes, and lots of French bread on a large
  table covered with plenty of paper.  When everyone has
  eaten his fill, everyone "peels for the house."  The
  peeled tails can then be used in cold crawfish
  cocktail or salad or for Fried Crawfish the next day.
  Serves 8-10 NOTE:  Most of the salt is not added until
  after the cooking process because too much salt added
  during cooking makes the flesh of the crawfish adhere
  to the shell. From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home Cooking"

  Bring seasonings to boil for 10 minutes.  Add
  potatoes, corn, and smoked sausage.  Boil for another
  10 minutes.  Add crawfish. Bring back to boil.  Cut
  fire off immediately.  Let soak for 20 to 30 minutes.
   Drain.  Peel and eat.     While water is coming to a
  boil, cull and clean crawfish. Rinse well with garden
  hose and remove any dead ones.     Always wear gloves
  when you fool with crawfish, but remember, they can
  still pinch you through gloves. Justin Wilson writes,
  "Not everybody likes the fat, but I do, and I love to
  dig my finger into the head and scoop it out.  During
  crawfish season, my finger stays yellow from one end
  to the other." From Justin Wilson's "Outdoor Cooking

     Title: Shrimp Creole
Categories: Cajun Main dish Fish   
  Servings:  6

      2 lb Fresh shrimp, heads off
      1 qt Water
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      3 ea Med. yellow onions, chopped
      2 ea Large bell peppers, chopped
      5 ea Celery ribs, chopped fine
     10 ea Lge. tomatoes, peeled&seeded
      2 t  Salt
      1 t  Ground red pepper
    1/2 t  Ground black pepper
    1/2 t  Ground white pepper
      1 T  Fresh thyme or 2 t dried
      1 T  Fresh basil or 2 t dried
  1 1/2 t  Sugar
      5 ea Bay leaves
      1 c  Green onions, chopped
      1 c  Parsley, chopped

  Peel and devein the shrimp.  Place heads (if you have
  them), and peels in a small saucepan and add the
  water.  Bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat and
  let boil slowly for 15-20 minutes.  Strain and discard
  the heads and peels.    Place the oil in a Dutch oven
  or other large, heavy pot and place over medium-high
  heat.  Add the onions, peppers, and celery and saute
  stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft,
  about 45 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers,
  herbs, sugar, and shrimp stock and return to simmer.
   Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for 2 hours,
  stirring occasionally,  This is your creole sauce; it
  can be prepared 1 or 2 days in advance and stored in
  the refrigerator (I find the sauce is even better
  after sitting a couple of days in the refrigerator).
     When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a
  simmer and add the shrimp.  Cook until they turn pink,
  5-7 minutes.  Stir in the green onions and parsley and
  let cook for 1 minute more. Serve on flat plates over
  beds of rice.    Serves 6-8.
  SHRIMP AND HAM OR TASSO JAMBALAYA:
  Prepare Shrimp Creole as above, but add about a pound
  of cubed ham and a 4-ounce can of tomatoe sauce to the
  finished sauce and simmer 45 minutes more.  Meanwhile,
  boil or steam 2-3 cups raw rice. Finish the sauce
  (which will be your jambalaya base) by adding the
  shrimp, green onions, and parsley as above.  (If you
  are using leftover Shrimp Creole, remove the shrimp
  and reheat the sauce, add the ham and tomato sauce,
  and proceed as above.  Return the shrimp to the pan at
  the end of cooking.)  Place the hot, cooked rice in a
  large bowl, pour the jambalaya base over, mix well,
  and serve.    You can also prepare this dish with
  sausage instead of ham. From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home

     Title: Blackened Redfish
Categories: Cajun Main dish Fish   
  Servings:  6

      6 ea 8-10oz redfish fillets
    3/4 lb Unsalted butter, melted
-----------------------SEASONING MIX-----------------------
      1 T  Sweet paprika
  2 1/2 t  Salt
      1 t  Onion powder
      1 t  Garlic powder
      1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
    3/4 t  Ground white pepper
    3/4 t  Ground black pepper
    1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves
    1/2 t  Dried oregano leaves

  NOTE: Fish fillets (preferably redfish, pompano or
  tilefish) cut about 1/2 inch thick.  Redfish and
  pompano are ideal for this method of cooking.  If
  tilefish is used, you may have to split the fillets in
  half horizontally to have proper thickness.  If you
  can't get any of these fish, salmon steaks or red
  snapper fillets can be substituted.  In any case, the
  fillets or steaks must not be more than 3/4 inch thick.
  Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat
  until it is beyond the smoking stage and you see white
  ash in the skillet bottom (the skillet cannot be too
  hot for this dish), at least 10 minutes.  (FT - this
  recipe is *NOT* for the faint of heart)    Meanwhile,
  pour 2 Tablespoons melted butter in each of 6 small
  ramekins; set aside and keep warm.  Reserve the
  remaining butter in its skillet.  Heat the serving
  plates in a 250F oven.    Thoroughly combine the
  seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl. Dip each
  fillet in the reserved melted butter so that both
  sides are well coated; then sprinkle seasoning mix
  generously and evenly on both sides of the fillets,
  patting by hand.  Place in the hot skillet and pour 1
  teaspoon melted butter on top of each fillet (be
  careful, as the butter may flame up).  Cook,
  uncovered, over the same high heat until the underside
  looks charred, about 2 minutes (the time will vary
  according to the fillet's thickness and the heat of
  the skillet).  Turn the fish over and again pour 1
  teaspoon butter on top; cook until fish is done, about
  2 minutes more.  Repeat with remaining fillets.  Serve
  each fillet while piping hot.
     To serve, place one fillet and a ramekin of butter
  on each heated serving plate.
  I had this in K Pauls Restaurant in New Orleans.  It
  is a taste experience you will never forgive yourself
  for missing should you ever be lucky enough to find
  yourself in N'awlins and you don't go to K Paul's and
  order this.  Even people who don't like fish love this
  dish. From Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen,

     Title: Hot Chicken Wings
Categories: Cajun Appetizers Poultry   
  Servings:  6

  2 1/2 lb Chicken wings
      1 x  Oil for frying (optional)
      6 oz Hot sauce or Tabasco
    1/2 c  Melted butter

  Cut the chicken wings in two at the joints.  In a
  large frying pan or skillet; heat to 360F enough oil
  (or shortening) to cover the chicken wings.  Add the
  wings and fry until crisp, about 12-15 minutes.
     To bake, preheat the oven to 450F.  Spread the
  chicken wings out on a baking sheet in one layer and
  bake 45 minutes.    To make the sauce, combine the Hot
  Sauce or Tabasco and melted butter and blend
  thoroughly.  As soon as the chicken wings are cooked,
  douse with the sauce, and serve immediately.    Serves
  2-6 Nathalie Dupree's "New Southern Cooking"
  Nathalie says, "These little wings make a good meal
  for two or are a great appetizer.  Up North, they are
  called Buffalo wings and are served with celery and
  blue-cheese dressing.  The little wing tips should be
  trimmed off to make neater pieces.  But I cook them
  along with the wings and save them for myself.  I call
  them the "cook's treat."  You may fry or bake the
  wings, depending on dietary considerations.

    3/4 t  Garlic powder
    1/2 t  White pepper
    1/2 t  Dry mustard
    1/2 t  Rubbed sage
    1/2 t  Ground cumin
    1/2 t  Black pepper
    1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves
-------------------PORK CHOP INGREDIENTS-------------------
      6 ea 1-3/4" thick pork chops
    3/4 lb Ground pork
      1 c  Chopped onions
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers
      2 t  Minced garlic
      1 cn (4 oz) diced green chilies
      1 c  Pork or chicken stock
    1/2 c  Very fine bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Finely chopped green onions

  In a food processor or blender, process the apples, 4
  Tablespoons of the butter, the sugar, vanilla and
  nutmeg until smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Set aside.
    In a small bowl thoroughly combine the seasoning mix
  ingredients; set aside.
    Prepare the pork chops by cutting a large pocket (to
  the bone) into the larger side of each chop to hold
  the stuffing.   In a large skillet, brown the ground
  pork in the remaining 3 Tbsp. butter over high heat,
  about 3 minutes.  Add the onions, bell peppers,
  garlic, and 2 Tbsp. of the seasoning mix, stirring
  well; cook about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and
  scraping pan bottom well.  Stir in the green chilies
  and their juice and continue cooking until mixture is
  well browned, about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring
  occasionally and scraping the pan bottom as needed.
   Add the stock and cook 5 minutes, stirring
  frequently.  Stir in the bread crumbs and cook about 2
  minutes more, stirring constantly and scraping pan
  bottom as needed.  Remove from heat.
    Sprinkle the remaining seasoning mix evenly on both
  sides of the chops and inside the pockets, pressing it
  in by hand.  Prop chops with pocket side up in an
  ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan.  Spoon about 1/4 cup
  stuffing into each pocket; reserve the remaining
  stuffing.  Bake chops with pocket up at 400F until the
  meat is done, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Place the
  remaining stuffing in a small pan in the oven for the
  last 20 minutes to reheat.   Serve immediately with
  each chop arranged on top of a portion of the
  remaining stuffing.

     Title: Rice, Apple and Raisin Dressing
Categories: Cajun Main dish    
  Servings:  8

-----------------------SEASONING MIX-----------------------
      2 t  Salt
  1 1/2 t  White pepper
      1 t  Garlic powder
      1 t  Dry mustard
      1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
    1/2 t  Black pepper
---------------------RICE INGREDIENTS---------------------
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 c  Chopped onions
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers
    1/2 c  Pecan halves, dry roasted
    1/2 c  Raisins
      4 T  Unsalted butter
  1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice (converted)
      3 c  Pork, beef or chicken stock
      2 c  Chopped unpeeled apples

  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl
  and set aside.    In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil
  over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes.  Add
  the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2 minutes,
  stirring occasionally.  Add the pecans (we ran out of
  pecans, so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and
  continue cooking for about 3 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Add the raisins and butter (these are
  added together so the raisins will absorb as much
  butter as possible).  Stir until butter is melted,
  then cook until raisins are plump, about 4 minutes,
  stirring occasionally.  Add the rice and seasoning mix
  and cook until rice starts looking frizzly (a bit like
  ce Krispies)  Chef Prudhomme recommended using
  converted rice.  Lucy used brown, long grain rice -
  super!.  This will require about 2 to 3 minutes,
  stirring almost constantly before the rice looks
  "frizzly". Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom
  well, then stir in the apples. Cover pan and bring to
  boil; lower heat and simmer covered for 5 minutes.
   Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice
  is tender and stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes.
   (We cook the rice this slow way to let the flavors
  build to their maximum.)   Serve immediately, allowing
  about 3/4 cup per person. From Paul Prudhomme's

  least 2 cups of strained basic stock.
  dark meat, cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
  Directions:
  Place in the hot water, oil and salt in a large pot
  over high heat; and cover and bring to a boil.  When
  water reaches a rolling boil, add small amounts of
  spaghetti at a time to the pot, breaking up oil
  patches as you drop the spaghetti in.  Return to
  boiling and cook to al dente stage, do not over
  cook.(To test doneness of spaghetti, cut a strand in
  half near the end of cooking time.  When done, there
  should be only a speck of white in the center, less
  than one-fourth the diameter of the strand.) Do not
  overcook.  During this cooking time, use a wooden or
  spaghetti spoon to lift spaghetti out of the water by
  spoonfuls and shake strands back into the boiling
  water.  (It may be an old wives' tale, but this
  procedure seems to enhance the spaghetti's texture.)
   Then immediately drain spaghetti into a collander;
  stop cooking process by running cold water over
  strands.  (If you used dry spaghetti, first rinse with
  hot water to wash off starch.)  After the pasta has
  cooled thoroughly, about 2 to 3 minutes, pour a
  liberal amount of vegetable oil in your hands and toss
  spaghetti.  Set aside still in the colander.
      Meanwhile, thoroughly combine the seasoning mix
  ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
      In a 4-quart saucepan, combine 1-1/2 sticks of the
  butter, the onions and garlic cloves; saute over
  medium heat 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the
  minced garlic and seasoning mix; continue cooking over
  medium heat until onions are dark brown, but not
  burned, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add
  2-1/2 cups of the stock, the Worcestershire and
  Tabasco; bring to a fast simmer and cook about 8
  minutes, stirring often.  Stir in the tomato sauce and
  bring mixture to a boil.  Then stir in the sugar and 1
  cup of the green onions; gently simmer uncovered about
  40 nminutes, stirring occasionally.     Heat the
  serving plates in a 250F oven.     Combine the
  ingredients of the chicken seasoning mix in a small
  bowl; mix well.  Sprinkle over the chicken, rubbing it
  in with your hands.  In a large skillet melt 1-1/2
  sticks of the butter over medium heat.  Add the
  remaining 1 cup green onions and saute over high heat
  about 3 minutes. Add the chicken and continue cooking
  10  minutes, stirring frequently. When the tomato
  sauce has simmered about 40 minutes, stir in the
  chicken mixture and heat through.
      To finish the dish, for each serving melt 2
  tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium
  heat.  Add one-sixth of the cooked spaghetti (a bit
  less than a 2 cup measure); heat spaghetti 1 minute,
  stirring constantly.  Add 1-1/4 cups chicken and sauce
  and 2 tablespoons of remaining stock; heat throughly,
  stirring frequently.  Remove from heat. Roll spaghetti
  on a large fork and lift onto a heated serving plate.
  Repeat process for remaining servings. From Paul

  separately in 1 cup boiling water.  Carefully pour one
  flavor gelatin over each cake layer (if using oblong
  pan you must use the same flavors for the 2 pks).
   Chill 3-4 hours.  Dip one cake pan in warm water for
  10 sseconds, then unmold cake layer onto serving
  plate.  Top with about 1 c. cool whip.  Unmold second

    1/2 c  Sour Cream
      3 oz Baking Chocolate

  Sift togetehr the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking
  soda, and salt into a large mixing bowl.  Add
  shortening, sour cream, vanilla, eggs, water and
  chocolate (melted then cooled).  Beat with an electric
  mixer at low speed, scraping bowl constantly, for 1/2
  minute.  Increase speed to high and beat an additional
  3 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally.  Pour batter
  into 2 greased and waxed-paper lined 9-inch round cake
  pans.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. Oven for 35
  minutes or until cake tests done.  Cool in pans on
  racks for 10 minutes.  Remove from pans and cool
  completely on the racks.  Place one cake layer on
  serving plate.  Spread with Sour Cream / Chocolate
  Frosting.  Top with second cake layer.  Frost sides
  and top of the cake with the remaining Sour
  Cream/Chocolate Frosting. SOUR CREAM/CHOCOLATE
  FROSTING: Combine the softened butter or margarine,
  confectioners' sugar, and sour cream in a mixing bowl;
  blend well.  Add chocolate which has been melted and
  cooled and vanilla.  Beat until smooth. NOTE:
  I have seen reference to people having trouble with
  their layer cakes and how they rise.  Try this little
  trick when making this cake.  Take the layer that has
  the least amount of rise on the top and trim it to be
  flat with a sharp knife.  Place the trimmed side down
  (layer should be upside down).  Then frost between
  layers and place the other layer on right side up and
  finished frosting.  It will give the illusion of
  having a cake with only one domed layer and will sit
  better on your cake plate.  Also the trimmings are
  great eating just plain for the cook or for the kids.

      3 T  Oil
    1/4 c  Packed brown sugar

  MARINATING:  Break tamarind apart, place in a small
  saucepan with water. Simmer, covered, for about 10
  minutes or until pasty coating separates from seeds.
   Press through a sieve or food mill to extract all
  pulp and soupy liquid.  Discard seeds.  Rinse shrimps
  thoroughly, pat dry and marinate fro 1 hour with 1
  tablespoon of this tamarind liquid, the oyster sauce
  and hot chili sauce. COOKING:  Meanwhile, cut young
  ginger into toothpick-sized slivers.  If using mature
  ginger, peel and sliver.  Peel and sliver garlic.
   Place blachan in a non-stick pan and heat gently fro
  3 to 4 minutes to develop the flavors.  Pell and cut
  red onions into wedges.  Combine oyster, soy and chili
  sauces with blachan; stir into remaining tamarind
  liquid.  Heat a large wok over high heat.  When a drop
  of water sizzles immediately into steam pour in 2
  tablespoons of the oil.  Swirl up sides of wok, and
  when just at smoking point, dump in ginger and garlic.
   Stir fry until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Adding
  more oil as needed, stir frey shrimp in batches until
  orange red, about 3 minutes.  Pour sauces over all the
  shrimp in the wok and cook at a brisk bubble over high
  heat until shrimps are aromatic and sauces have
  reduced and thickened to enrobe the shells, about 8
  minutes.  Mix in sugar and onion wedges, taste to
  adjust seasoning, sweetening and spiciness.  Makes
  plenty for 6 as a principal dish with rice, enough for
  8 with other dishes.

    1/2 c  Heavy Cream
      2 T  Passion Fruit; **

  *      Use sweet cream butter and DO NOT substitute
  margarine. **     Make the passion fruit pulp from
  fresh passion fruits or substitute
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- NOTE:  Prebaked crusts are much
  crisper than the chilled ones and this can be
  important if you want a crisp crust. CRUST:
  If you are prebaking the shell, preheat the oven to
  350 degrees F.  Place the crumbs in a mixing bowl and
  add the butter and sugar blending well. Press the
  crumb mixture into the bottom and up the sides of an
  8-inch springform pan.  Smooth the mixture to form an
  even layer on the bottom and sides.  Bake the crust in
  the oven for 10 minutes and let cool to room
  temperature before filling. NOTE:  This crust can be
  chilled for 5 to 10 minutes in the freezer until it is
  set but is not recommended in this recipe. CHEESECAKE:
  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.  In a large mixing
  bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until light and
  fluffy.  Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating
  well after each.  Beat in the flour, lemon rind, lemon
  juice, and vanilla until just mixed.  Whip the cream
  until stiff in a medium mixing bowl.  Set aside.  In
  another mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until they
  form stiff peaks, then fold them into the cheese
  mixture.  Fold in the reserved whipped cream.  Stir in
  the passion fruit pulp then pour the mixture into the
  prepared crust and bake fro 45 minutes to 1 hour.
   Cool, in the oven, to room temperature, then chill.

    1/2 t  Nutmeg; Grated
    1/4 t  Cinnamon; Ground
    1/4 c  Currants; Dried

  *     DO NOT use margarine in this recipe.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- CRUST:
  Sift together the flour, salt and sugar into a
  medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the butter to the flour
  all at once.  Mix together until well blended.  Then
  add the shortening and continue to blend by cutting it
  into the flour mixture.  The mixture will begin to
  look like crumbs or small pebbles. It will have the
  texture of oatmeal.  Sprinkle the water over the
  dough, distributing it evenly throughout.  The dough
  will be come sticky and cling together.  Gather it
  into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap.  Chill for at
  least 30 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
   When the pastry has chilled, roll it out on a pastry
  board to a thickness of 1/8-inch.  The easiest way is
  to roll the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper.
   Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin and transfer
  it to a 9-inch pie tin.  Gently press it into the tin
  without stretching it.  Use the excess pastry to make
  flutes or cut away the excess with a sharp knife or
  scissors.  Prick the bottom of the pastry shell
  thoroughly to prevent trapped air from bubbling the
  dough.  Butter a sheet of aluminum foil and place the
  foil down into the shell.  Weight it down with weights
  or beans to keep the crust from lifting up.  Bake the
  crust for 7 to 10 minutes then remove the weight and
  the foil.  Return the crust to the oven and continue
  baking for another 8 to 10 minutes or until the crust
  is lightly browned.  If you have difficulty rolling
  out the dough, do not reroll it; just patch the tears
  or holes.  Rerolling will make the pastry tough.
  FILLING: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Press the
  cottage cheese through a sieve.  In a small saucepan,
  gently heat the cream and the sherry until steamy, do
  not allow it to scorch.  In a mixing bowl, beat
  together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, rosewater, and
  the spices until frothy -- about 5 minutes.  In a
  large mixing bowl, beat the cottage cheese until it is
  smooth then add the egg mixture and blend well.  Add
  the hot cream and sherry slowly  to the cheese mixture
  and beat until well blended.  Stir in the currants and
  pour the mixture into the prepared crust.  Bake for
  about 30 minutes, then allow to cool.  Chill and
  sprinkle with cinnamon.

  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- NOTE:  THIS IS A SPECIAL CAKE
  REQUIRING A NEW LARGE FLOWER POT 7 X 7-INCHES AT A
  MINIMUM. Press the cheese through a sieve.  Combine
  the cheese with the egg yolks, beating in 1 yolk at a
  time.  Add the sugar and blend well.  Heat the cream
  in a large saucepan until it almost boils, then add
  the cheese mixture and cook over low heat, stirring
  constantly, until the mixture thickens.  Remove from
  the heat before it begins to boil.  Stir in the
  fruits, almonds, and lemon rind.  Cool.  Cream
  together the butter and the vanilla, then stir into
  the cooled cheese mixture.  Line the flower pot with
  several layers of moistened cheesecloth, leaving
  enough cloth at the top to form a flap that will cover
  the pot.  Fill the pot with the cheese mixture and
  cover with the flap.  Put a weight on the top and
  place in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.  The whey
  (liquid) will drip out the bottom of the pot, so be
  sure to place a pan under it.  When drained, carefully
  unmold the cake with a knife.  Remove the cheesecloth
  and smooth the sides with a hot knife.  Prepare the
  sauce.  Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, Madeira,
  and lemon rind in the top of a double boiler.  Cook
  and continue beating until the mixture thickens.  Stir
  in the lemon juice and the rum, then chill briefly.
   Pour the sauce over the cheesecake and serve. NOTE:
  This very unusual cheesecake is a traditional Russian
  Easter dish.  In the old days, the custom was to
  decorate it with paper flowers or religious emblems
  and have the priest come by and bless it.  Back then,
  it was made in a special pyramid-shaped form, but you
  can make it in an ordinary red clay flower pot.
   Visually, the effect is quite striking, and the
  drainage hole allows the excess whey to escape.  To
  make paskha, you will need a large flower pot and some
  cheesecloth.  The paskha will keep in the refrigerator
  for several weeks, but be sure to make it at least
  three days in advance.

     Title: Shortbread Crust
Categories: Cheesecakes     
  Servings:  1

  1 1/2 c  Unbleached Flour; Sifted
      1 x  Sugar; Granulated, *
      1 ea Egg; Large, Separated, **
    1/2 c  Butter; Softened, ***

  *     Use from 1/4 to 1/3 cup of granulated sugar. (To
  Taste.) **    Separate the large egg and lightly beat
  the yolk. ***   Use only sweet cream, unsalted butter
  in this recipe.  NO MARGARINE.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
   Working on a large flat surface, such as a pastry
  board, place the flour and the sugar in the center of
  the surface and mix together.  Form a small depression
  or well in the center of the mound.  Add the beaten
  egg yolk and the softened butter to the well, ten
  blend these with the dry mixture.  Mix the ingredients
  thoroughly using your hands -- there's no substitute
  for warm hands. Shape the dough into a ball and wrap
  in plastic wrap.  Chill for at least 10 minutes.  Roll
  out the dough to a thickness of about 1/4-inch.  You
  should have a circle of about 11 inches in diameter.
   For best results, roll out your dough between 2
  sheets of waxed paper, then peel away the paper and
  cut the crust in a 9-inch circle.  Place the circle
  inside a 9-inch springform pan.  Prick the crust
  several times with a fork to keep the crust from
  puffing up during the baking.  Place the springform
  pan in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or
  until light brown.  Allow to cool.  Using the leftover
  dough, line the sides of the springform pan. Press the
  dough against the sides of the pan, smoothing it so as
  to have a continuous layer of crust all the way around
  the sides of the pan.  Make sure that the side crust
  meets the bottom crust all the way around.  Brush the
  reserved egg white onto the shell, covering the bottom
  and sides. This will seal the dough and keep it from
  becoming soggy.  Set aside until ready to use.
  NOTE:
  For the Italian Cheesecake, add 1 ts of grated lemon
  rind and 1 ts of Amaretto Liqueur when adding the egg
  yolk and butter.

      2 T  Rosemary
      1 t  Chopped basil

      1 T  Paprika
      2 t  Lemon juice
      2 lb Raw shrimp in their shells
      1 x  Salt

  Shrimp should be of a size to number 30-35 per pound.
  Melt the butter and oil in a flameproof baking dish.
   Add the garlic, herbs, peppers, bay leaves, paprika,
  and lemon juice, and bring to a boil.  Turn the heat
  down and simmer 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
  Remove the dish from the heat and let the flavors
  marry at least 30 minutes.  This hot butter sauce can
  be made a day in advance and refrigerated.
     Preheat the oven to 450F.  Reheat the sauce, add
  the shrimp, and cook over medium heat until the shrimp
  just turn pink, then bake in the oven about 30 minutes
  more.  Taste for seasoning, adding salt if necessary.
  Nathalie Dupree writes of this recipe in her book "New
  Southern Cooking," "Shrimp taste better when cooked in
  their shells because the fat under the shells
  preserves their flavor and tenderness.  When the
  shells are crisp it is a pleasure to eat the shrimp
  with their shells on.  This rich butter sauce cries
  out to be sopped up with crusty bread once the shrimp
  are gone."

Categories: Cajun Appetizers Breads   
  Servings: 10

  2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour

    1/2 c  Butter
      1 c  Sour cream
      2 T  Creole seasoning
      2 T  Kosher salt for sprinkling

  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Sift together the flour,
  sugar, salt, and baking soda into a bowl or food
  processor.  Cut in the butter.  Add the sour cream and
  Creole Seasoning (see recipe for Creole Seasoning),
  and mix to a soft dough.  Roll out paper-thin on a

  with kosher salt and place on an ungreased baking
  sheet.  Bake for 5-8 minutes.  Turn off the heat and
  allow the bread to crisp in the oven.
  Nathalie Dupree describes this recipe in her book "New
  Southern Cooking" this way; "This crisp, cracker-like
  bread is good just flavored with salt and sour cream.
   But add Creole Seasoning and you'll have a hot and
  spicy appetizer that will leave your guests begging
  for the recipe.  It's nice to keep a big airtight
  cookie jar full of these for snacking."

      2 qt Cold water
      1 ea Med. onion, (see note)
      1 ea Large clove garlic (note)
      1 x  Bones, excess meat (notes)
-------------------FOWL AND GAME STOCKS-------------------
  1 1/2 lb Backs, necks, bones (notes)
-------------------BEEF OR TURTLE STOCK-------------------
      2 lb Beef shank (see notes)
------------------------PORK STOCK------------------------
      2 lb Pork neck bones (see notes)
-----------------------SEAFOOD STOCK-----------------------
      2 lb Rinsed shrimp heads (notes)

  Notes:  To the basic stock, you can also add vegetable
  trimmings from the recipe(s) you are serving, in place
  of the onion, garlic and celery.  The recipe calls for
  the onion and garlic to be unpeeled and quartered.
     Also, you may include bones and any excess meat
  (excluding livers) from meat or poultry, or shells or
  carcasses from seafood, used in the recipe(s) you're
  cooking, or FOR FOWL AND GAME STOCKS: 1 1/2 to 2
  pounds backs, necks and/or bones from chickens, guinea
  hens, ducks, geese, rabbits, etc. FOR BEEF OR TURTLE
  STOCKS: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds beef shank (preferred) or
  other beef or turtle bones. FOR PORK STOCK:  1-1/2 to
  2 pounds pork neck bones (preferred) or other pork
  bones. FOR SEAFOOD STOCK:  1-1/2 to 2 pounds rinsed
  shrimp heads and/or shells, or crawfish heads and/or
  shells, or crab shells (2-1/2 to 3 quarts), or rinsed
  fish carcasses (heads and gills removed), or any
  combination of these.  (you can also substitute oyster
  liquor for all or part of seafood stock called for in
  a recipe). NOTE:  If desired, you can first roast meat
  bones and vegetables at 350F until thoroughly browned.
   Then use them to make your basic stock.  (When you
  brown the bones and vegetables, the natural sugar in
  both caramelizes on the surface, which gives the stock
  a fuller taste and adds color when it dissolves in the
  stock water.) Always start with cold water--enough to
  cover the other stock ingredients.  Place all
  ingredients in a stock pot or a large saucepan.  Bring
  to a boil over high heat, then gently simmer at least
  4 hours, preferably 8 (unless directed otherwise in a
  recipe), replenishing the water as needed to keep
  about 1 quart of liquid in the pan.  The pot may be
  uncovered, or set the lid on it askew.  Strain, cool
  and refrigerate until ready to use.  (Note: Remember
  if you are short on time, using a stock simmered 20 to
  30 minutes is far better than using just water in any
  recipe..) TO MAKE A RICH STOCK: Strain the basic
  stock, then continue simmering until evaporation
  reduces the liquid by half or more.  For example, if
  your recipe calls for 1 cup "Rich Stock," start it
  with at least 2 cups of strained basic stock.  (Rich
  stocks are needed when a sauce requires lots of taste
  but only a limited amount of liquid, for example,
  "Oyster Sauce for Beef."

     Title: Seafood Stuffed Flounder
Categories: Cajun Main dish Fish   
  Servings:  6

-----------------------SEASONING MIX-----------------------
      1 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Sweet paprika
    1/2 t  Black pepper
    1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves
    1/2 t  Sweet basil
    1/2 t  Gumbo file (optional)
---------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS---------------------
      3 ea Slices bacon, diced
  1 1/2 c  Onions, chopped very fine
      1 c  Green bell peppers, chopped
    1/4 lb + 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
    3/4 t  White pepper
    3/4 t  Ground cayenne pepper
    1/2 lb Small shrimp
  1 1/2 c  Basic seafood stock
      6 ea Shucked oysters (med. size)
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Green onions, chopped fine
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
------------------FLOUNDER SEASONING MIX------------------
      2 t  Salt
      1 t  Sweet paprika
    1/2 t  White pepper
    1/2 t  Onion powder
    1/2 t  Garlic powder
    1/2 t  Dry mustard
    1/4 t  Ground cayenne pepper
    1/4 t  Dried thyme leaves
    1/4 t  Dried sweet basil leaves
      6 ea Flounders (see note)
  1 1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
      1 x  Vegetable oil for frying

  NOTE: Flounder should be 1 to 1-1/4 pounds each,
  boned, heads removed and brown side split down the
  center. Combine the first seasoning mix ingredients in
  a small bowl; mix well and set aside. In a large
  skillet fry the bacon over high heat until crisp. Add
  onions, celery and bell peppers. Stir well and saute
  until vegetables start to get tender, about 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally. Add 3 tablespoons of the butter
  and the white and red peppers; stir until butter is
  melted. Stir in the shrimp and the first seasoning
  mix. Continue cooking for about 3 to 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally and scraping pan bottom well.
  Stir in the stock and the oysters; cook and stir about
  6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Use a slotted spoon
  to spoon the seafood vegetable mixture into a food
  processor or blender, leaving the liquid in the
  skillet; process mixture until smooth, about 15 to 30
  seconds. Return mixture to skillet, stirring to blend
  with liquid; turn heat to high, and cook until mixture
  starts sticking excessively, about 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally and scraping pan bottom well. Remove from
  heat. Meanwhile, in a 1-quart saucepan melt the
  remaining 6 tablespoons butter over high heat; when
  almost melted, remove from heat, then add 1/4 cup of
  the flour and stir until mixture is smooth. Return to
  high heat for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Turn heat
  to high under the stuffing mixture; gradually add the
  butter-flour mixture, stirring constantly until well
  blended. If mixture starts "weeping" oil at this
  point, stir in about 2 tablespoons more stock or
  water.) Continue cooking until very thick, about 1 to
  2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the green onions
  and cook 1 minute more, stirring constantly. Remove
  from heat and stir in the Parmesan. Cool slightly,
  then refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes. In a
  small bowl thoroughly combine the flounder seasoning
  mix ingredients. Open the flounders for stuffing.
  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon ofthe seasoning mix on the
  inside of each flouner. Mound 1/4 cup of the cheddar
  cheese in the center of each, then spoon a scant 1/2
  cup chilled stuffing on top of the cheese. Close the
  fish so the stuffing doesn't show. Cover and
  refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of
  the seasoning mix on each side of each chilled
  flounder, patting it in with your hands. In a pan
  (cake and pie pans work well) combine the remaining
  seasoning mix with the remaining 1/2 cup flour. In a
  large, heavy skillet heat 1/4 inch oil over high heat
  to about 350F. Meanwhile, place each flounder (split
  side up) in the seasoned flour to coat only the bottom
  surface. Carefully slide each flounder into the hot
  oil and fry the bottom until it's crispy, crunchy and
  brown-brown!-- about 3 to 4 minutes. Without draining,
  place the flounder, still split side up, on an
  ungreased cooke sheet. Bake at 550F until the fish are
  cooked and well browned on top, about 10 minutes
  (after about 4 minutes, drape a piece of aluminum foil
  over the tails so they won't burn). Serve immediately
  as is, or topped with Hollandaise Sauce, Shrimp and
  Crab Buttercream Sauce, or Bearnaise Sauce

     Title: Fish Brown Sauce
Categories: Cajun Sauces Fish   
  Servings:  6

-----------------------SEASONING MIX-----------------------
      1 ea Whole bay leaf
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Garlic powder
    1/4 t  White pepper
    1/4 t  Dried oregano leaves
    1/4 t  Dried thyme leaves
    1/8 t  Ground cayenne pepper
---------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS---------------------
      2 T  Vegetable oil
      3 T  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Finely chopped onions
      4 t  Canned tomatoe sauce
      1 t  Worcestershire sauce
      2 c  Hot basic seafood stock
      2 T  Burgundy wine
      2 T  Unsalted butter, softened

  Serve this delicious sauce over broiled, fried or
  baked fish fillets or broiled, fried or baked oysters.
     Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small
  bowl and set aside.    Heat the oil in a heavy 1-quart
  saucepan over high heat just until the oil starts to
  smoke, about 1 to 2 minutes.  With a metal whisk, mix
  in 2 tablespoons of the flour, whisking constantly and
  scraping pan bottom well, until the roux is dark
  red-brown to black, about 2 minutes, being careful not
  to let it scorch or splash on your skin.  (Remove from
  heat momentarily if it is browing too fast for you to
  control, continuing to stir constantly.)  Immediately
  whisk in the onions; reduce heat to low and continue
  stirring and cooking about 1 minute.  Add the tomato
  sauce and stir and cook 1 minute.  Then stir in the
  seasoning mix and the Worcestershire (the mixture
  should now be thick and dark red-brown); cook 2 to 3
  minutes, stirring constantly.  Add the stock; turn
  heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring often.
   Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook about 6 to
  8 minutes, stirring often.  Stir in 1 tablespoon of
  the burgundy and remove from heat.    In a small bowl
  mix the butter and remaining 1 tablespoon flour until
  creamy.  Return sauce to low heat; gradually add the
  butter mixture to the sauce, whisking until well
  blended each time.  Return sauce to a simmer and
  simmer 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add the remaining
  1 tablespoon burgundy.  Remove from heat and discard
  bay leaf. Serve immediately.

     Title: Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef
Categories: Cajun Sauces    
  Servings:  6

    3/4 c  Chopped onions
    1/2 c  Chopped green peppers
    1/4 c  Chopped celery
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
    1/4 c  + 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
    3/4 t  Ground cayenne pepper
    1/2 t  White pepper
    1/2 t  Black pepper
      2 ea Bay leaves
    1/4 c  Minced jalapeno peppers(note
      1 t  Minced garlic
      3 c  Basic beef stock

  NOTE: Fresh jalapenos are preferred; if you have to
  use pickled ones, rinse as much vinegar from them as
  possible.    Combine the onions, bell peppers and
  celery in a small bowl and set aside while you start
  the roux.  (NOTE: Unlike the roux in most other
  recipes in this book, the roux we use here is light
  brown.  Therefore, instead of heating the oil to the
  smoking stage, we heat it to only 250F; this prevents
  the roux from getting too brown.)    In a heavy
  2-quart saucepan heat the oil over medium-low heat to
  about 250F. With a metal whisk, whisk in the flour a
  little at a time until smooth.  Continue cooking,
  whisking constantly, until roux is light brown, about
  2 to 3 minutes.  Be carefyul not to let the roux
  scorch or splash on your skin.  Remove from heat and
  with a spoon immediately stir in the vegtable mixture
  and the red, white and black peppers; return pan to
  high heat and cook about 2 minutes, stirring
  constantly.  Add the bay leaves, jalapeno peppers and
  garlic, stirring well.  Continue cooking about 2
  minutes, stirring constantly.  (We're cooking the
  seasonings and vegetables in the light roux and the
  mixture should, therefore, be pasty.) Remove from heat.
     In a separate 2-quart saucepan, bring the stock to
  a boil.  Add the roux mixture by spoonfuls to the
  boiling stock, strirring until dissolved between each
  addition.  Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat
  to a simmer and cook until the sauce reduces to 3-1/2
  cups, about 15 minutes. Skim any oil from the top and
  serve immediately. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana

     Title: Barbecued Shrimp
Categories: Cajun Main dish Fish   
  Servings:  2

-----------------------SEASONING MIX-----------------------
      1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
      1 t  Black pepper
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Crushed red pepper
    1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves
    1/2 t  Dried rosemary leaves, crush
    1/8 t  Dried oregano leaves
---------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS---------------------
    1/4 lb + 5 Tbsp unsalted butter
      1 t  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2 t  Minced garlic
    1/2 c  Basic shrimp stock
    1/4 c  Beer at room temperature

  Rinse the shrimp in cold water and drain well.  Then
  pinch off and discard the portion of the head from the
  eyes forward (including the eyes, but not the
  protruding long spine above the eyes).  Leave as much
  as possible of the orange shrimp fat from the head
  attached to the body.  Set aside.    In a small bowl
  combine the seasoning mix ingredients.  combine 1
  stick of the butter, the garlic, Worcestershire and
  seasoning mix in a large skillet over high heat.  When
  the butter is melted, add the shrimp.  Cook for 2
  minutes, shaking the pan (versus stirring) in a
  back-and-forth motion.  Add the remaining 5
  tablespoons butter and the stock; cook and shake pan
  for 2 minutes.  Add the beer and cook and shake the
  pan 1 minute longer.  Remove from the heat.
     Serve immediately in bowls with lots of French
  bread on the side, or on a platter with cooked rice
  mounded in the middle and the shrimp and sauce
  surrounding it. LAGNIAPPE:  A certain percentage of
  oil is released when butter is melted, shaking the pan
  in a back-and-forth motion and the addition of stock
  to the butter keep the sauce from separating and
  having an oily texture--stirring doesn't produce the
  same effect. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

     Title: Shrimp Sauce Piquant
Categories: Cajun Sauces Fish   
  Servings:  8

      2 T  Unsalted butter
  2 1/4 c  Chopped onions
  1 1/2 c  Chopped green bell peppers
    3/4 c  Chopped celery
      3 c  Peeled & chopped tomatoes
      1 c  Canned tomato sauce
      3 T  Minced jalapeno (see note)
      2 ea Bay leaves
  5 1/2 t  Ground cayenne pepper
  1 1/2 t  White pepper
      1 t  Ground black pepper
  1 1/2 t  Minced garlic
  2 1/4 c  Basic seafood stock
  1 1/2 t  Dark brown sugar
    3/4 t  Salt
      2 lb Peeled large shrimp
      4 c  Hot basic cooked rice

  NOTE:  Fresh jalapenos are preferred; if you have to
  use pickled ones, rinse as much vinegar from them as
  possible.    Melt the butter in a 4-quart saucepan
  over high heat.  Add the onions, bell peppers and
  celery; saute about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, jalapenos, bay leaves,
  ground peppers and garlic; stir well.  Continue
  cooking about 3 minutes, stirring often and scraping
  the pan bottom well.  Stir in the stock, sugar and
  salt and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
  until flavors are married, about 20 minutes, stirring
  often and scraping pan bottom as needed.  (If mixture
  scorches, quit stirring and pour mixture into a clean
  pot, leaving the scorched ingredients in the first
  pan.)    Add the shrimp to the hot (or reheated) sauce
  and stir.  Turn heat up to high, cover pan, and bring
  mixture to a boil.  Remove from heat.  Let sit covered
  for 10 minutes.  (Meanwhile, heat the serving plates
  in a 250F oven.)  Stir, remove bay leaves, and serve
  immediately.    To serve, mound 1/2 cup rice in the
  center of each heated serving plate; then pour about
  1/2 cup sauce around the rice and arrange about 8
  shrimp on top of the sauce. LAGNIAPPE:  "Piquant" to a
  Cajun means "it's hot and 'hurts like a sticker in
  your tongue.'"  If you want less "piquant," reduce the
  jalapeno peppers by half.  Sauce Piquant is enjoyed
  with such gusto in Louisiana that the town of Raceland
  has a Sauce Piquant Festival every year dedicated to
  nothing but fish, meat, fowl and seafood made with
  variations of this sauce.

     Title: Paneed Veal and fettucini
Categories: Cajun Main dish Meats   
  Servings:  6

      4 qt Hot water
      2 T  Vegetable oil
      1 T  Salt
    3/4 lb Fresh fettucini (1/2 lb dry)
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter
  2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
    3/4 c  + 4 tsp. Parmesan cheese
  1 3/4 c  Very fine dry bread crumbs
  1 1/2 T  Minced fresh parsley
  1 1/2 T  Olive oil
    3/4 t  White pepper
    1/2 t  Onion powder
    1/2 t  Garlic powder
      3 ea Eggs
      6 ea 4 oz slices white veal (note
      1 x  Vegetable oil for pan frying

  NOTE:  You will need 6, 3-1/2 to 4 ounce slices of
  baby white veal, pounded thin for this recipe.
     Place the water, the 2 tablespoons oil and the salt
  in a large pot over high heat; cover and bring to a
  boil.  when water readdds a rolling boil, add small
  amounts of fettucini at a time to the pot, breaking up
  oil patches as you drop it in.  Return to boiling and
  cook oncovered to al dente stage (about 3 minutes if
  fresh pasta, 7 minutes if dry); do not overcook.
   during this cooking time, use a wooden or spagheti
  spoon to left fettucini out of the water by spoonfruls
  and shake strands back into the water.  (It may be an
  old wives' tale, but this procedure seems to enhance
  the pasta's texture.)  Then immediately drain in a
  colander and stop its cooking by running cold water
  over strands (if you used dry pasta, first rinse with
  hot water to wash off starch); after it has cooled
  thoroughly, about 2 to 3 minutes, pour a liberal
  amount of vegetable oil in your hands and toss
  fettucini.  set aside still in the colander.    Melt
  the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat;
  add the cream and cayenne pepper.  Turn the heat to
  medium-high.  with a metal whisk whip the cream
  nmixture constantly as it comes to a boil.  the reduce
  heat and simmer until the sauce has reduced some and
  thickened enough to coat a spoon well, about 7 to 8
  minutes, whisking constantly.  Remove from heat and
  gradually add 3/4 cup of the parmesan, whisking until
  cheese is melted.  Set aside.
     Heat 6 large serving plates in a 250F oven.
  In a shallow pan (cake and pie pans work well) combine
  the bread crumbs, parsley, olive oil, white pepper,
  onion and garlic;, mix well.  In a separate pan beat
  the eggs well, then beat in the remaining 4 teaspoons
  Parmesan.  Soak the veal in the egg mixture for at
  least 5 minutes, being sure to coat it thoroughly.
   Meanwhile, heat 1/4 inch oil to about 400F in a large
  skillett.  Then, just before frying, dredge veal in
  the bread crumbs, coating well and pressing the crumbs
  in with your hands; shake off any excess.  Fry the
  veal in the hot oil until golden brown, about 1 minute
  per side.  Do not crowd.  (Change the oil mid-way
  through frying if the crumbs in the bottom start to
  burn.)  Remove veal to a large platter and set aside.
      Reheat the cheese sauce over medium-high heat,
  whisking frequently. (NOTE:  If butter starts
  separating from the sauce,  whisk in about 1
  tablespoon cream or water.)  Add the fettucini and
  loss until tho9roughly coated and heated through,
  about 1 minute.  Remove from heat and serve
  immediately.    To serve, place a piece of veal on
  each heated serving plate.  roll each portion of
  fettucini onto a large fork and lift onto the plate;
   Top the fettucini with additional sauce from the
  skillet. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

  1 1/2 c  Julienned zucchini (see note
      1 c  Julienned squash (see Note)
      1 x  Very Hot Cajun Sauce/Beef

  NOTE:  To julienne squashes, cut peelings 1/8 inch
  thick and cut these into strips 1/8 inch wide and 2
  inches long; use only strips that have skin on one
  surface.  Cut carrots and onions into similar strips.
     In a 13x9-inch ungreased baking pan, combine the
  beef and pork.  Mix in the eggs and bread crumbs by
  hand until thoroughly mixed.  Set aside.    In a
  1-quart saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons of the butter,
  the onions, celery, bell peppers, garlic,
  Worcestershire, Tabasco and meat seasoning mix.  Saute
  over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring frequently
  and scraping the pan bottom well.  Remove from heat
  and cool.  Add the sauteed vegetable mixture and 1/4
  cup of the milk to the meat and mix well by hand.
   Form into a 12x8-inch loaf and center in the pan.
   Bake at 450F until brown on top, about 30 minutes.
   Remove from oven; pour off drippings, reserve 2-1/2
  tablespoons.  Set meat and drippings aside.
     Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until fork tender;
  drain, reserving about 1 cup of the water.  Place the
  potatoes, while still hot, in a large mixing bowl with
  the remaining 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup milk, the salt
  and white pepper.  Stir with a wooden spoon until
  broken up, then beat with a metal whisk (or electric
  mixer with a paddle) until creamy and velvety smooth.
   (NOTE: Mix in some of the reserved potato water if
  potatoes are not creamy enough.)  In a large skillet
  (preferably non-stick) combine the reserved drippings
  with the carrots, onions and vegetable seasoning mix;
  saute over high heat 1-1/2 minutes, stirring
  frequently.  Add the zucchini and yellow squash and
  continue sauteing until vegetables are noticeably
  brighter in color, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Remove from heat.
     Mound undrained vegetables on top of the meat loaf,
  away from the edges.  Layer the mashed potatoes evenly
  over the top of the vegetables and top edges of the
  meat, using all the potatoes.  Bake at 525F until

     Title: Pecan Pralines - Prudhomme
Categories: Cajun Candies    
  Servings: 36

  1 1/2 ea Sticks unsalted butter
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Packed, light brown sugar
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Chopped pecans
      2 c  Pecan halves
      2 T  Vanilla extract

  NOTE: To judge doneness, use one or more of the
  following guides; 1.  Candy thermometer will read 240F
  2.  When done, the batter will begin forming distinct
  threads on the sides or bottom of the pan.
  3.  Near the end of the cooking time, make a test
  praline every few seconds.  The early-test pralines
  will be somewhat runny, very shiny and somewhat
  translucent.  The ideal praline will have progressed
  past that stage--it will not be runny and will be less
  shiny; when cooled it will be opaque, lusteriess and
  crumbly instead of chewy. 4.  Near the end of the
  cooking time, drizzle spoonfuls of the mixture across
  the surface of the mixture.  When ready, the mixture
  will form a neat thread across the surface.
     Assemble all ingredients and utensils before
  starting to cook.  You will need a large heavy
  bottomed aluminum pot or skillet with deep sides, a
  long handled metal whisk or spoon, 2 large spoons (or
  an ice cream scoop with a manual release) and a
  lightly buttered cookie sheet.    Be careful not to
  get any of the mixture on you skin, as it sticks and
  can cause serious burns.    Melt the butter in the pot
  over high heat.  As soon as it's melted, add the
  sugars and cream.  Cook 1 minute, whisking constantly.
   Add the milk and chopped pecans,  cook 4 minutes
  more, whisking constantly.  Reduce heat to medium and
  continue cooking and whisking 5 minutes.  Add the
  pecan halves and vanilla and continue whisking and
  cooking until done, about 15 to 20 minutes longer (see
  NOTE above on tests for doneness).  If mixture starts
  to smoke toward end of cooking, lower the heat.
     Remove pan from heat.  Quickly and carefully drop
  the batter onto the cookie sheet by heaping spoonfuls,
  using the second spoon to scoop the batter off the
  first (or use ice cream scoop).  Each praline should
  form a 2-inch patty about 1/2 inch thick.  Cool and
  store in an airtight container, or wrap each praline
  in plastic wrap or foil. LAGNIAPPE:  To clean the pot
  and utensils, boil water in the pot with the utensils
  in it.  This will melt the batter off. From Paul

  add the sugars, milk, cream and chopped pecans.  cook
  5 minutes, whisking constantly.  reduce heat to
  medium, and continue cooking and whisking 10 minutes.
   Add the pecan halves and continue whisking and
  cooking until done, about 8 to 10 minutes.  (If the
  mixture smokes excessively toward end of cooking time,
  lower thge heat.)  Stir in vanilla.  then immediately
  drop about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips into about
  one-sixth of the batter.  Stir quickly and just enough
  to cover some of the chips with batter but not nenough
  to allow the chips to melt.  Quickly drop the
  chocolate mixture onto the cookie sheet by heaping
  spoonfuls, using the second spoon to push the batter
  off the first (or use ice cream scoop); each praline
  should be about 2 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch
  thick.  repeat with remaining mixture, stirring
  briefly before adding more chocolate chips.  The
  cooled pralines should be light brown, opaque,
  somewhat chunky and crumbly. LAGNIAPPE:  To clean the
  pot and utensils, boil water in the pot with the
  utensils in it.  This will melt the batter off. From

     Title: Pecan Pralines - Patout
Categories: Cajun Candies    
  Servings: 24

      2 c  Heavy cream
      4 c  Raw or brown sugar
      1 t  Vanilla
      2 c  Pecan halves
      2 T  Butter

  Alex Patout swears his recipe makes "The creamiest
  pralines anywhere" Butter a medium saucepan--this will
  make it easier to clean later.  Pour in the cream and
  place over high heat.  When it begins to boil, add the
  sugar and stir rapidly until it dissolves.  Then stir
  in the vanilla and pecans and continue to cook over
  medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture
  reaches the soft-ball stage (236F on the candy
  thermometer). Remove from heat and quickly beat in the
  butter--this helps arrest the cooking process.  The
  candy should lose its glossy color and become very
  cloudy.    Lay out a long strip of waxed paper on a
  work surface.  Moisten it with a damp towel.  Drop
  good-sized spoonfuls of the hot praline mixture onto
  the waxed paper, stirring the mixture occasionally as
  you go along to keep it well combined.  Remove the
  pralines from the paper before they have cooled
  completely--later on it will be hard to remove them
  without breaking them.  Store in tightly sealed
  containers, with layers of waxed paper in between.
  Makes about 2 dozen

    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 c  Water
      2 c  Pecan halves

     Title: Blackened Pork Chops
Categories: Cajun Main dish Meats   
  Servings:  6

     18 ea 5 oz pork chops, 3/4" thick
    3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter (note
-----------------------SEASONING MIX-----------------------
      1 T  Salt
      1 T  + 2 tsp white pepper
      1 T  + 3/4 tsp black pepper
  2 1/2 t  Dry mustard
  2 1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
      2 t  Garlic powder
    3/4 t  Dried thyme leaves

  NOTE:  The 3/4 pound (3 sticks) unsalted butter, must
  be kept melted and warm in the skillet.
  Let the chops come to room remperature before
  blackening.  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients
  thoroughly in a medium-size bowl.    Heat a large
  cast-iron skillet over very high heat until it is
  extremely hot and just short of the point at which you
  see white ash or a white spot forming in the skillet
  bottom, about 8 minutes.  (The time will vary
  according to the intensity of the heat source.)
     Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.    Just
  before cooking each chop, dip it in the melted butter
  so that both sides are well coated, then sprinkle each
  side generously and evenly with the seasoning mix (use
  between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoon on each side), patting it
  in with your hands.  (If you lay the chop on a plate
  or other surface to season it, be sure the surface is
  warm so the butter won't congeal and stick to the
  surface instead of to the chop.  Wipe the surface
  clean after seasoning each chop.  Use any remnaining
  seasoning mix in another recipe.)    Immediately place
  the chop in the hot skillet.  If the chop is very
  lean, pour about 1 teaspoon butter on top.  (Be
  careful, as the butter may flame up.)  If you cook
  more than 1 chop at a time, place each chop in the
  skillet before buttering and seasoning another one.
     Cook uncovered over the same high heat until the
  underside forms a crust, about 2 minutes (the time
  will vary according to the thickness of the chops and
  the heat of the skillet or fire).  Turn the chops over
  and pour about 1 teaspoon more butter on top of each,
  if needed.  Cook just until meat is done, about 2
  minutes more.  Serve the chops crustier side up while
  piping hot.    Clean the skillet after cooking each
  batch and repeat the blackening procedure with the
  remaining chops.    To serve, place 2 or 3 chops on
  each heated serving plate.  If you use a serving
  plater, DO NOT STACK THE CHOPS. From The Prudhome
  Family Cookbook Some personal notes:  If you do not
  have a heavy duty commercial range hood, capable of
  disposing of an incredible amount of smoke, DON'T cook
  this inside.  If you live in an apartment, like I do,
  where your smoke detector is attached to a central
  fire system, you will very quickly become well known
  to all your neighbors, and your local firefighters. In
  all likelyhood you will also get to meet your
  landlord.    A good, 40,000 BTU to 50,000 BTU barbecue
  will do a good job of providing sufficient heat.  Be
  sure you have all your doors and windows closed, and
  invite your neighbors to the barbecue.  This method
  generates a totally unbelievable amount of smoke.
   However, the results are worth it.  Whatever you are
  cooking by this method, it is an entirely incredible
  taste experience. From Prudhomme Family Cookbook

     Title: Blackened Chicken
Categories: Cajun Main dish Poultry   
  Servings:  8

     16 ea 3 oz skinless chicken breast
-----------------------SEASONING MIX-----------------------
      2 T  Salt
  1 1/2 t  Garlic powder
  1 1/2 t  Ground black pepper
      1 t  White pepper
      1 t  Onion powder
      1 t  Ground cumin
    1/2 t  Gound cayenne pepper
    1/2 t  Sweet paprika
---------------------OTHER INGREDIENTS---------------------
    3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter

  NOTE: Recipe calls for 16 (3-ounce) skinless boned
  chicken breasts, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, or 8
  (10-ounce) bone-in leg-thigh pieces, or a combination
  of these.  Skin the leg-thigh pieces, then bone each
  piece along the length of the two bones, leaving meat
  in one piece.  Trim off excess fat.  Pound each breast
  or leg-thigh fillet to 1/2 inch thick. Let the chicken
  come to room temperature before blackening.
   Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a
  small bowl.    Heat a large cast-iron skillet over
  very high heat until it is extremely hot and just
  short of the point at which you see white ash or a
  white spot forming in the skillet bottom, about 8
  minutes.  (the time will vary according to the
  intensity of the heat source.)    Heat the serving
  plates in a 250F oven.    Just before cooking each
  piece of chicken, dip it in the melted butter so that
  both sides are well coated, then sprinkle each fillet
  evenly with the seasoning mix, using about a rounded
  1/2 teaspoon on each, and patting it in with your
  hands.  (If you lay the fillet on a plate or other
  surface to season it, be sure the surface is warm so
  the butter won't congeal and stick to the surface
  instead of to the meat.  Wipe the surface clean after
  seasoning each fillet.  Use any remaining seasoning
  mix in another recipe.)
     Immediately place the fillet skinned side down in
  the hot skillet, making sure all meat folds are opened
  up and the meat is lying flat.  Pour about 1 teaspoon
  butter on the top of the fillet (be careful, as the
  butter may flame up).  If you cook more that 1 fillet
  at a time, place each fillet in the skillet before
  buttering and seasoning another one.    Cook uncovered
  over the same high heat until the underside forms a
  crust, about 2 minutes.  (The time will vary according
  to the thickness of the fillets and the heat of the
  skillet or fire;  watch the meat and you'll see a
  white line coming up the side as it cooks.)  Turn the
  fillets over and pour about 1 teaspoon more melted
  butter on top of each.  Cook just until meat is cooked
  through, about 2 minutes more.  Serve the chicken
  fillets crustier side up while piping hot.    Clean
  the skillet after cooking each batch and repeat the
  blackening procedure with the remaining chicken
  fillets.    To serve, place 2 breast fillets or 1
  leg-thigh fillet on each heated serving plate.  If you
  use a large serving platter, do not stack the fillets.
  Paul Prudhomme warns, "Blackening should be done
  either outdoors or in a commercial kitchen.  The
  process creates an incredible amount of smoke that
  will set off your own and your neighbors' smoke
  alarms.  People with really well-installed commercial
  hood vents at home have gotten away with blackening in
  their own kitchens.  They are privileged!  Don't push
  your luck."

  cider to the syrup to make 1 1/3 cups.  Return the
  syrup and apples to the saucepan. Combine the
  cornstarch and water in a small bowl and stir until
  well blended.  Stir the cornstarch mixture and the
  cinnamon into the apple mixture.  Cook over medium
  heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to
  a boil.  Remove from the heat and stir in the butter,
  then pour the mixture into the pastry lined pie tin.
   Roll out the remaining pastry to an 11-inch circle.
   Fold the pastry gently, so as not to tear it, into
  quarters and cut slits in the folds.  Gently unfold
  the pastry on to the top of the filling and trim the
  edge to 1-inch beyond the rim of the pie tin.  Fold
  the top crust under the lower crust and form a ridge
  by fluting the edge of the pie.  Bake in a 400 degree
  F. oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown.
   Cool on a wire rack until slightly warm before
  cutting and serving. NOTE:
  This is the perfect pie to serve with the rich cheddar
  sauce in this file.

     Title: Apple Pie In Cheddar Crust
Categories: Cheese Desserts Fruits Pies  
  Servings:  6

-----------------------CHEDDAR CRUST-----------------------
      2 c  Unbleached Flour; Sifted
  1 1/4 c  Cheddar; Md, Shredded
    1/2 t  Salt
    2/3 c  Vegetable Shortening
      1 x  Water; Iced
--------------------------FILLING--------------------------
      7 c  Apples; *
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 t  Cinnamon; Ground
      1 ea Egg Yolk; Lg, Beaten
      2 tb Unbleached Flour
      2 tb Butter Or Regular Margarine
      1 tb Water

  *    Use tart cooking apples such as Macs or Granny
  Smith's.  Core, pare
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++++++ CHEDDAR CRUST:
  Combine the flour, cheese and salt in a bowl.  Using a
  pastry blender or two knives, cut in the shortening
  until coarse crumbs form.  Sprinkle the iced water (5
  or 6 tbls will be needed) and using a fork, toss the
  crumbs until a dough is formed.  Press the dough
  firmly into a ball. FILLING:
  Divide the pastry almost in half and roll out the
  larger half, on a lightly floured surface, to a
  13-inch circle.  Line a 9-inch pie plate with the
  pastry, trimming the edges to 1/2-inch beyond the rim
  of the pie plate.  (Note:  When lining the pie plate,
  be careful not to stretch the pastry when spreading it
  out.  This will cause holes or the pastry will shrink
  and the filling will run over in the oven as it is
  baked.  Place in the pie plate and gently, working
  from the center, spread the pastry out until it covers
  the bottom of the pie plate and then lay the rest of
  the pastry over the rim and trim.)  Combine the
  apples, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl, mixing
  well.  Arrange the apple mixture in the pastry lined
  pie plate.  Roll out the remaining pastry to an
  11-inch circle. Gently fold into quarters and cut
  steam slits in the folds.  Unfold the crust and place
  on top of the filling, trimming the crust to 1-inch
  beyond the rim of the pie plate.  Fold the top crust
  under the lower one and flute to form a ridge around
  the edge of the pie plate.  Combine the egg yolk and
  water, then brush the mixture over the top crust and
  rim.  Bake in a 400 degree F. oven for 45 to 50
  minutes or until apples are tender and the crust is a
  golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack until slightly warm
  and serve with Vanilla Ice Cream, if desired.

     Title: Cheddar Braids
Categories: Breads Cheese Yeast bread   
  Servings:  8

      1 c  Water; Warm, 110-115 Deg. F.
      1 pk Active Dry Yeast; OR
      1 tb Active Dry Yeast; Bulk
  3 1/2 c  Unbleached Flour; *
      1 t  Sugar
  1 1/2 t  Salt
    3/4 c  Butter; Room Temperature
      4 ea Eggs; Lg, Room Temperature
      6 oz Cheddar; Extra Sharp, Diced
      1 ea Egg; Lg
      1 tb Milk
      2 tb Celery Seeds

  *    You can use up to 4 1/2 cups of flour in this
  recipe depending on the      weather.
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++++++ Pour the warm water into a warm
  bowl and add the yeast.  Stir to dissolve then let
  stand until light and puffed, about 5 minutes.  Add 1
  1/2 cups of the flour, sugar and salt.  Beat with an
  electric mixer on the lowest speed for 1 minute.  Beat
  on medium speed for 2 minutes longer.  Add the butter
  to the yeast mixture and beat for another 1 minute.
   On the lowest speed on the mixer, beat in 1 egg and
  1/2 cup of flour until well blended, repeating until
  the 4 eggs are used up and enough flour has been added
  to make a soft sticky dough.  Continue to beat with
  the mixer or by hand, until the dough is glossy and
  elastic and pulls away from the side of the bowl.
   Stir in the cheddar cheese by hand.  Cover and let
  rise in a warm place free from drafts until doubled in
  bulk, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. When the dough has
  doubled in bulk, punch down and place in the
  refrigerator for at least 5 hours or better,
  overnight.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator.
   Divide in half and cover and refrigerate the second
  ball of dough.  Knead the remaining ball of dough on a
  lightly floured surface until soft and pliable.
   Divide the dough into 3 equal parts and roll each
  piece into a rope 12 to 16-inches long.  Braid the
  ropes, starting in the middle and working toward each
  end.  Pinch the ends together so seal them.  Grease a
  large baking sheet and place the finished braid on one
  side of the sheet.  Repeat with the refrigerated
  dough.  In a small bowl beat the egg and milk
  together.  Brush the braids with the egg mixture and
  let the braids rise in a warm place, free from drafts,
  until dough in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Do not
  cover.  Midway through the rising time, brush with the
  egg mixture again.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
   When fully risen, brush with the egg mixture for a
  final time and sprinkle evenly with the celery seeds.
   Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven until a
  wooden skewer or pick inserted in the braid comes out
  dry.  Remove from the oven and from the baking sheet.
   Cool to room temperature, on wire racks, before
  slicing.

     Title: Brownie Cookies
Categories: Desserts Cookies Chocolate   
  Servings: 48

      4 oz Semisweet chocolate
      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
  2 1/3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
  1 1/2 t  Baking soda
    1/2 t  Baking powder
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      1 T  Vanilla extract
      2 ea Egg
      1 T  Milk
    3/4 c  Finely chopped walnuts

  1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. 2.  Sift the
  flour, baking soda, and baking powder together. Set
  aside. 3.  In the bowl of a mixer, cream the butter.
  Add the sugar slowly and continue to beat. Add the
  vanilla, then the eggs 1 at a time. Add the chocolate
  and stir to blend. 4.  Stir in the dry ingredients and
  the milk by hand. When just blended, mix in the
  walnuts. Cover and refrigerate dough for 30 minutes
  before rolling. 5.  Preheat oven to 375 degres.
  Lightly grease a cookie sheet. 6.  To form the
  cookies, scoop out a portion of dough and roll out on
  a well-floured surface. When dough is 1/4 inch thick,
  cut it into rounds or other desired shapes. Re-roll
  scraps and cut again. 7.  Place on cookie sheet (leave
  room for expansion) and bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Watch
  for any hot spots in the oven and don't let these
  cookies overbrown. VARIATION:  For the Brownie Cookie
  Crust, make 1 recipe of Brownie Cookies and chill the
  dough briefly. Lightly grease the back side of a large
  baking sheet. Roll the dough out onto the baking sheet
  as thinly as possible so that the baked product will
  crumble easily. Bake crust at 375 degrees for 5 to 7
  minutes. Let crust harden, then slide the cookie from
  the sheet and cool completely. Roll over the cookie
  with a rolling pin until it is crushed to a fine
  crumb. (There should be about 2 1/4 cups of crumbs.)
  Melt 1 stick plus 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter. Mix
  it into the crumbs and pack the mixture over the
  bottom and up the sides of a 10-inch springform pan.
  Freeze for 30 minutes before filling in order to set
  the crust. Note: When I made this, I made individual
  cookie crumb crusts for the "Kit's Chocolate Mousse"
  recipe by using a large muffin pan.  Line each cup
  with waxed paper for easy removal.

  and reduce the sauce for two minutes. Put the chicken
  back into the pan and bring just to a simmer. Remove
  to serving platter. Serve hot with fresh vegetables or
  over rice or pasta. (I serve this over fettucini, or
  with a side dish of Fettucini Alfredo). *** Cut
  chicken breasts in half only. Place each half between
  sheets of waxed paper and pound with a meat tenderizer
  until about 1/8" thick. Saute shallots in butter until
  tender. Divide shallots equally between the breast
  halves, spreading evenly over each. Place one slice of
  prosciutto on each breast half, fold in half, and
  secure with toothpicks. Saute about 4 to 5 minutes on
  each side in the butter and olive oil listed in the
  original ingredients. Chicken is done when it springs
  back when lightly pressed with finger. Follow the
  balance of the instructions listed above for the
  sauce. Source: The original recipe came from "The

     Title: Chicken Milanese
Categories: Chicken     
  Servings:  4

      4 ea Chicken breast halves; skin
    3/4 c  Parmesan; freshly grated
      2 T  Parmesan; freshly grated
    3/4 c  Breadcrumbs; fresh white
      1 T  Parsley; minced fresh
    1/8 t  Salt
    1/8 t  Pepper; freshly ground
      1 ea Egg
    1/2 c  Milk
      2 c  Olive oil
      2 T  Butter; unsalted
      2 T  Lemon juice; fresh
      1 ea Lemon; quartered
      1 x  Parsley springs; fresh

  Flatten chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper
  to thickness of 3/8 inch, using meat mallet or rolling
  pin.  Mix cheese, breadcrumbs, minced parsley, salt
  and pepper in large bowl.  Whisk egg with milk in
  medium bowl to blend.  Dip chicken into egg, then into
  breadcrumb mixture, coating completely and pressing to
  adhere.  Shake off excess breadcrumbs.  Heat oil in
  heavy large deep skillet to 375 degrees. Add chicken
  and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about
  4 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to paper
  towels and drain. Transfer chicken to platter. Melt
  butter in small saucepan. Mix in lemon juice and pour
  over chicken.  Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley
  sprigs. *** My notes:  I found that 3/4 cup each
  parmesan and breadcrumbs makes too much coating for 4
  chicken breasts, so I reduced the amounts to 1/2 cup
  each- which is still about enough for 6 breasts. I use
  Bertolli Extra Light olive oil for frying, and just
  enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.

  Cook bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium heat
  until beginning to brown. Add green onions and stir
  until softened, about 1 minute. Add cream and simmer
  until beginning to thicken, about 1 minute.  Mix in
  1/2 cup Romano cheese and chopped fresh basil.
  Meanwhile, cook fettuccine in large pot of boiling
  salted water until just tender but still firm to bite,
  stirring occasionally. Drain well.  Return to hot pot.
  Add sauce and stir to coat. Season with salt and

  cup whipping cream, 1/2 cup each Parmesan and Romano,
  1 tbsp dried basil, and substituted 4 or 5 thin slices
  of Prosciutto for the bacon- frying slightly in
  butter. I used about 6 ounces of "Pesto Linguini",
  which is a thinner pasta containing basil. We like
  LOTS of sauce! Source:  Stephanie Dicamillo- Cooking

  1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. Let it cool
  until only warm. 2.  While the chocolate cools, whip
  the cream until it forms medium-stiff peaks. Do not
  overbeat or the mousse will lose some of its smooth,
  light texture. 3.  Separate 4 of the eggs and set the
  whites aside. Combine yolks with the 2 remaining whole
  eggs in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat until eggs
  are thick and lemon colored, around 5 minutes. While
  the yolks are beating, place the 4 egg whites in a
  clean copper or stainless steel bowl and whisk,
  preferably by hand, until the whites start to stiffen.
  Sprinkle on the confectioners' sugar and beat until
  you have firm peaks. 4.  Working quickly, add the
  cooled melted chocolate and a scoop of the whipped
  cream to the egg yolks. Stir until smooth, then add
  the remaining cream. When it is fully incorporated,
  add the liqueur and vanilla, then fold in the whites
  until just blended. 5.  This mousse can be poured into
  small individual serving dishes or into 1 larger
  dessert dish. Chill at least 4 hours before serving.
  (Chilling it overnight intensifies the flavor.) The
  mousse may be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Remove from

  overnight before serving. VARIATION: Make a Brownie
  Cookie Crust from the Brownie Cookies recipe, then
  fill it with the mousse. Chill for 4 hours, then pipe

  A local restaurant serves a simple, but elegant,

   This is my own attempt at duplicating it. Stir the
  chopped green onions into the Dill Cream Dressing.
   Add salt and pepper to taste.  You may also want to
  add more lemon juice or Dijon mustard at this point,
  as this produces a fairly bland dressing.  Slice
  potatoes (leave skins on) about 1/4 inch thick. Place
  in a large bowl and fold in the dressing.  Serve
  chilled.  Best made the day before so the flavors have

     Title: Orange Poppyseed Dressing
Categories: Salads Dressings    
  Servings:  8

    2/3 c  Safflower or corn oil
    1/4 c  Lime juice
      2 T  Orange juice
      2 T  Orange rind; grated
      2 T  Honey
      2 T  Onion; minced
      1 T  Poppy seeds
      1 x  Salt & pepper to taste

  ** I used peanut oil and minced green onions when I
  made this.  I served it on a salad of Boston lettuce
  with melon and chopped prosciutto. Slightly toast the
  poppy seeds (method below).  Place all ingredients in
  a screw-top jar. Shake vigorously.  Chill until
  serving. This dressing complements any green salad,
  but the addition of some small chunks of cantelope,
  honeydew, or star fruit to your greens will enhance
  the orange-honey flavor of the dressing.  Or try it
  over slices of cold roast pork with nectarine wedges
  on watercress. Poppy Seeds:  Did you know that it
  takes almost a million seeds to make a pound?  These
  tiny bluish-black gems come from the opium poppy
  plant.  But even if you eat a million, you won't
  experience any narcotic effect. Connoisseurs say those
  imported from Holland taste best. For even better
  flavor, seeds should be slightly toasted in a 350
  degree oven for about 5 minutes.
