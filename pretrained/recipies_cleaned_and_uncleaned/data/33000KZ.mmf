      Title: WALNUT BEER BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
  1 1/2 c  Warm beer
      2 pk Active dry yeast
  4 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
           -- or as needed
    1/2 c  Rye flour
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Walnut oil
      1 c  Finely chopped yellow onion
    3/4 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
      1    Egg
      2 ts ;Water
           Fresh or dried rosemary
 
  Heat the beer to 105 to 115 F. and pour 1/2 cup into a small bowl.
  Stir in the yeast and let stand 10 minutes.
  
  Mix the flours, sugar and salt in a large bowl.  Make a well in the
  center. Pour the yeast mixture, oil and remaining 1 cup beer into the
  well and stir until blended.
  
  Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10
  minutes, adding more flour if necessary.
  
  Coat a large bowl with walnut oil.  Place the dough in the bowl and
  turn to coat with oil.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a
  warm place until doubled in bulk.  (You can also let the dough rise
  overnight in a cool place or in the refrigerator.)
  
  Punch dough down and knead in the onion and walnuts until evenly
  distributed throughout the dough.
  
  Divide dough in half.  Divide each half into thirds.  Using your
  hands, roll each of the pieces into 12" long ropes.  Braid 3 ropes
  together to form a loaf.  Tuck the ends under and place on an 18 x
  12" baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, placing it on the same
  baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, 45 minutes to
  1 hour.
  
  Beat the egg and 2 tsp. water in a small bowl.  Brush the tops of the
  loaves with the egg wash and sprinkle with rosemary.  Bake at 375 F.
  until crusty and brown, 45 to 50 minutes.  Cool in the pans for 10
  minutes. Turn out onto wire racks and cool completely.
  
  The authors write: "A hearty and rustic bread that makes an excellent
  picnic lunch with cheese, especially goat's milk cheese.  Take your
  favorite full-bodied red wine along."

      2 c  Grated "German's sweet" or
           - bittersweet chocolate
  1 1/2 c  Sifted confectioner's sugar
      4 tb Rum
           Cocoa powder
 
  Combine nuts, sugar, and chocolate. Moisten with rum to form a stiff
  dough. Form into small balls and roll in cocoa to coat. This recipe
  is not only simple, it's flexible. It can be made with other kinds of
  liquor (amaretto, sherry, and Southern Comfort work well), nuts
  (almonds or pecans, for instance) and coatings (ground nuts, finely
  grated coconut, etc.) and always comes out tasting great. Adding
  small chunks of nut for texture is also effective.

      Title: WALNUT CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Potato flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Plus 2 teaspoons (1/3

           Walnuts
      1 c  Ice water
           Salt for the tops (opt.)
 
  "These crackers capture the essence of walnuts. Rich and meaty, but
  at the same time light and crisp, they are excellent with a blue
  cheese spread and a glass of port. 350~F. 25 to 30 minutes Preheat
  the oven to 350~F.
  
  Mix the flours and salt together in a large bowl or in the food
  processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
  Add the walnuts and stir until they are evenly distributed
  throughout. Blend in enough of the water to form a dough that will
  hold together in a cohesive ball. The dough will be somewhat sticky.
  
  Wrap the dough in wax paper or lightly buttered aluminum foil and
  chill for at least 1/2 hour.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. If desired,
  sprinkle the tops lightly with salt and roll over the dough with your
  rolling pin. With a cookie cutter, glass, or juice can, cut the dough
  into 2-inch rounds.
  
  Place them on a lightly greased or parchemnt-lined baking sheet.
  Prick each round in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake for
  25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack. Yield:

      Title: WALNUT CRESCENTS #2
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 3/4 c  Flour
    1/3 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Ground walnuts
      2    Egg yolks
      1 c  Sweet butter
           Confectioners sugar
 
   Legend has it that bakers started making pastry in the form of
  crescents following the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683.
  
   Preheat oven to 350ø.
  
   In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar and ground walnuts. Make a little
  well in the flour mixture and add the egg yolks. Cut butter into
  small pieces and add to the flour mixture. Knead thoroughly and shape
  into a ball. Add flour, if needed, to prevent the dough from sticking
  to the bowl.
  
   Cut the ball in 4 parts and shape each part in a roll about inch
  thick. Cut 1/4-inch pieces and form small crescents in the palm of
  your hand. Place crescents on a greased baking sheet and bake about
  9-10 minutes, until light brown.
  
   While still warm, roll the crescents in the confectioners sugar (be
  careful, they break very easily), then place them on a board to cool.
  Store in a cookie tin. The flavor actually improves with time.

      Title: WALNUT HONEY BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Walnuts -- coarsely chopped
    1/2 ts Active dry yeast
      1 c  Water -- 105-115 degrees
      2 tb Water -- 105-115 degrees
    3/4 c  Basic bread sponge
      5 tb Honey
  1 1/2 tb Walnut oil
  2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour --
           Unbleached
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour -- for
           Kneading
      1 tb Kosher salt
           Cornmeal -- for sprinkling
 
  Try using maple syrup instead of honey.
  
  Can use olive oil instead of walnut.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the walnuts on a baking sheet,
  roasting until fragrant and golden brown, about eight minutes. Cool.
  
  In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
  minutes.
  
  Stir the sponge, honey and oil into the water, breaking the sponge up
  using your hands or a spoon.
  
  Add 2 3/4 cups of the flour and salt and mix, scraping and folding
  until the dough gathers into a single mass. Knead, in the bowl, until
  the dough becomes soft and only slightly sticky, using the additional
  flour gradually as necessary.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead the nuts
  into the dough until they are evenly distributed.
  
  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate overnight.
  
  Halve the dough and shape each piece into a ball and place on a
  flour-dusted kitchen towel.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to
  rise in a draft-free location for two hours.
  
  Sprinkle a baking sheet generously with cornmeal. Gently press one of
  the dough balls down on a lightly floured surface and then reshape
  into a ball. Do the same with the other risen ball. Place both balls,
  with the seams on the bottom, on the baking sheet, cover with plastic
  wrap and allow to rise until doubled, in a draft-free location. This
  should take 2-3 hours.
  
  Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking
  stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425. Place a baking pan with
  decent sides on the bottom shelf. Boil two cups of water. Using a
  razor blade, make an 'X' in the top of each of the loaves. Pour the
  boiling water into the baking pan.   With a quick jerk, slide the
  loaves off the sheet and onto the stone.
  
  Bake for 30-35 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when
  tapped on the bottom.  When done, cool on a rack.

      Title: WALNUT HORNS
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 5 Dozen
 
      2 c  Flour
      1 c  Butter
      8 oz Sour cream
      1    Egg yolk
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Walnuts, ground
    1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
           Butter
 
  Cream the flour and butter.  Mix in the sour cream and the egg yolk.
  
  Divide the dough into four parts, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for
  several hours.
  
  Mix together the brown sugar, walnuts and cinnamon.
  
  Roll each dough section on a floured surface until about 1/8 inch
  thick. Spread about 1/4 of the sugar/walnut/cinnamon mixture over
  each rolled dough section. Cut the dough into pie-shaped wedges and
  roll, beginning at the wide end.
  
  Place cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Brush with melted butter
  (about 2 T should be enough). Bake for about 20 minutes at 375
  degrees F. If you remove the cookies from the oven before they turn
  brown, the dough will be softer and flakier. If you remove them after
  they have browned slightly, the dough will be crisper.
  
  Remove cookies from cookie sheet before they have cooled completely,
  or else they stick to the cookie sheet.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rolled, walnut-filled cookies -- This recipe has been in the
  family for a while. These cookies make great Christmas gifts.
  
  *  During my childhood, these cookies tasted wonderful. However, now
  they strike me as a bit sweet. You could probably decrease the amount
  of brown sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 and make up for the loss in volume by
  increasing the amount of nuts.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  Initial preparation:  10 minutes; chilling: at least 2 hours;
  final preparation:  20 minutes; baking: 20 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the dough ingredients.

  :          flat-leaf parsley
      3/4 c  olive oil
      1/3 c  grated Parmesan cheese
  
  Finely chop the walnuts and the garlic in a food processor; add half
  the basil and the salt;  coarsely chop. Add the remaining basil and
  the parsley.  With the food processor running, add the oil in a slow
  steady stream through the feed tube until mixture is thoroughly
  blended. Transfer to a bowl; fold in the cheese. Remove 1/2 cup of
  the pasta cooking liquid before draining the pasta.  Toss hot pasta
  with the sauce and the reserved cooking liquid.  Serve at once with
  additional cheese, if desired. Note: taste and adjust salt and add
  pepper)
  
  I grow basil in a very large pot during the spring and summer and
  make a lot of batches of pesto (omitting the cheese) and freeze
  individually in small Dixie cups. After it is frozen, I remove from
  the cups and wrap in Saran Wrap, then place in a freezer Ziploc. To
  serve defrost as many "pesto patties" as you need and follow above
  directions remembering to save the pasta water and add cheese.  I
  also use 4 cloves of garlic in this recipe (we love garlic) and add
  more salt and pepper. Enjoy! Walt MM

      Title: WALNUT-ONION HERB BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Breadmaker
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/4 tb Active dry yeast
      2 tb Sugar
      1 c  Warm water (105-115)
      1 c  Warm milk (105-115)
      1    Egg
      2 ts Salt
      2 tb Walnut oil or unsalted buttr
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
           Or
  1 1/2 tb Dried dill
  4 1/2 c  Flour
    1/3 c  Minced white onion
    2/3 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
 
  *This recipe is for making bread in a casserole dish with no
  kneading. To make it in a bread machine cut liquid and flour in half.
  In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast and a pinch of sugar over the
  warm water. Stir to dissolve and let stand until foamy, about 10
  minutes. In a large bowl, combine the mild, remaining sugar, egg,
  salt, oil or butter, dill and 1 1/2 cups flour. Beat with a wisk or
  heavy duty mixer until smooth. Add the yeast mixture and remaining
  flour 1/2 cup at a time, beating vigorously about 2 minutes. Batter
  will be sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm area
  until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Sprinkle the onion and walnuts
  over the top of the batter and stir down, beating vigorously to
  evenly distribute. Turn into a well greased 3-quart casserole or
  souffle dish, 9-inch springform pan, or 9-inch kugel of tube mold.
  Cover loosley with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm area until
  doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
  Bake in the center of the oven until the top is crusty brown, hollow
  when tapped and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out
  clean, about 45-50 minutes. Run a sharp knife around the sides of the
  pan and turn out of the pan onto a rack to cool right side up.
  Variation: add 4 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into cubes. *For Bread
  machine, dump in all ingredinets and push start.

  medium-high heat.  In three batches, brown the beef well, removing
  each batch with a slotted spoon. Set aside.

  Nathalie Dupree Loves Fresh Mushrooms For Quick Meals
  
  Nathalie Dupree's new cookbook "Nathalie Dupree Cooks Quick Meals For
  Busy Days" (Clarkson Potter,February, 1996), is filled with simple
  yet elegant "rush hour" recipes and time-savings tips.
  
  To clean mushrooms: Put mushrooms in a plastic bag with two
  tablespoons of flour or baking soda, fill the bag 3/4 full of cold
  water, then quickly shake and drain. The mushrooms come out free of
  soil and need only to be patted dry with a towel.

      Title: WARM CHOCOLATE CAKES-MARTHA STEWART LIVING
 Categories: Desserts, Cheesecakes, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 Minicakes
 
     14 oz Best-quality bittersweet
           -chocolate
      6 tb Heavy cream
      6 tb Unsalted butter, plus more
           -for tins
      5 lg Eggs, separated
     10 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla
    3/4 c  Ground almonds
           Confectioners' sugar, for
           -dusting (opt.)
 
  1. To make ganache, chop 2 oz of the chocolate into small pieces and
  place in small bowl. Pour cream into a small saucepan and heat until
  bubbles appear around edge. Pour hot cream over chocolate, let stand
  several minutes, and stir until smooth. Pour ganache into 6 squares
  of a plastic ice-cube tray. Freeze until solid.
  
  2. Butter six 3-inch metal baking rings and place on a parchment-lined
  baking sheet; set aside.
  
  3. Melt butter and remaining 12 oz chocolate in a heatproof bowl over
  simmering water. Stir until smooth. Let cool slightly.
  
  4. Meanwhile, combine egg yolks, 6 tablespoons of the sugar, and the
  vanilla in bowl of an electric mixer. Beat until thick and pale
  yellow, 5 to 8 minutes. Add chocolate butter mixture and thoroughly
  combine. Fold in ground almonds.
  
  5. In a separate bowl, beat remaining 4 tablespoons sugar with the egg
  whites until stiff. Fold into egg yolk-chocolate mixture. Spoon about
  3 T of batter into each ring. Remove frozen ganache cubes from
  freezer; you may need to dip the bottom of the ice tray in hot water
  to get them out. Place a cube in the center of each ring. Spoon
  remaining batter into rings, being careful to keep ganache cubes in
  center and cover them completely. Freeze filled molds until solid,
  about 1 hour.
  
  6. Heat oven to 375'. Take baking sheet from a freezer. Wrap any
  cakes to be saved and replace in freezer; leave the rest on sheet.
  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool 5 to 10
  minutes. To unmold, cover one hand with a clean dish towel and pick
  cake up on a spatula with the other. Invert cake into hand, pull off
  ring, then invert again onto a plate and dust with confectioners'
  sugar, if desired. Serve immediately.

           Jicama Salad (separate
           Recipe)
 
  For the Lobster Filling:  Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Fill a large
  stock pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil over high
  heat. Add lobsters and cook for about 8 minutes or until just done.
  Drain and let lobsters cool slightly. Wrap tortillas tightly in foil
  and place in preheated 300 degree oven for about 15 minutes or until
  heated through. Keep warm until ready to use. Remove meat from
  lobster tails being careful not to tear it apart. Cut meat into thin
  medallions (or medium-sized dice, if meat breaks apart). Heat oil in
  a medium saute pan over medium heat and saute lobster medallions
  until just heated through. Spoon equal portions of warm lobster
  medallions into the center of each warm tortilla. Sprinkle with equal
  portions of grated cheese and shredded spinach. Roll tortillas into a
  cylinder shape and place each one on a warm serving plate with the
  edge facing the bottom. Surround the taco with Yellow Tomato Salsa
  and garnish each side with a small mound of Jicama Salad (separate
  recipe).
  
  For the Yellow Tomato Salsa:  In a food processor, using the steel
  blade, process tomatoes until well chopped. Do not puree. Combine
  tomatoes and their juices with shallot, garlic, cilantro, vinegar,
  chilies, lime juice, and salt, mixing well. Add maple syrup, if
  needed, to balance flavor and sweeten slightly. Cover and refrigerate
  for at least 2 hours or until very cold. Note: For a crunchier, more
  typical salsa, put tomatoes through fine die of a food grinder.
  
  Chef's Notes:  "I created this dish in early 1986 and it quickly
  became my signature appetizer on The Mansion on Turtle Creek menu.
  The name 'Lobster Taco' perfectly illustrates the casual elegance
  that characterizes Southwest cuisine. Its appeal is rooted in the
  combination of rich lobster and a simple flour tortilla. The salsa
  and salad garnishes produce an explosion of color that promises
  exciting dining".

    2/3 c  Hot water
      2 T  Fresh lime juice with pulp
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 T  Shredded carrots for garnish
 
  * I find the easiest way to mince lemon grass is to peel away the
  tough
    outer leaves and put the bulb end through the slicer on my food
    processor.  Save the green tops to cut up and add to soups, etc.
  
  Combine all salad ingredients and toss gently.  Place about a cup of
  the salad mixture in individual bowls.  Top with about two cups of
  the noodles. Set aside.
  
  Heat the oil in a wok or nonstick fry pan over moderate heat.  Tilt
  the pan to evenly coat the entire surface.  Wait for the oil to get
  hot, then add the onion, garlic, and lemon grass.  Stir-fry about 10
  seconds. Working very quickly, add the chili paste and black
  mushrooms.  Add the say sauce, salt, and sugar and stir a few times.
  Add the carrots and prawns and cook until both are almost cooked, 2
  minutes.  Add the white mushrooms and chicken stock.  Cook until
  mushrooms begin to wilt, 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat.
  
  To serve, place the prawns and vegetables on top of the noodles.
  Garnish with chopped peanuts and cilantro.  Invite guests to add 3-4
  tablespoons of Vietnamese dipping sauce to their noodels and toos
  gently before eating.
  
  Vietnamese Dipping Sauce: Place garlic, chili paste and chili in a
  mortar. With a pestle, pound into a paste. (If you do not have a
  mortar & pestle, finely mince the garlic and chili.)
  
  Combine the garlic mixture with the remaining ingredients in a small
  mixing bowl.  Stir until the sugar has dissolved.  Ladle sauce into
  serving bowls and float the carrot slivers on top.

      Title: WARM SALAD OF RUDDERFISH IN GREEN SAUCE
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    200 ml Extra-virgin olive oil
     70 ml Lemon juice
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
      1    Handful parsley
      1 sm Capsicum, chopped
      3    Green onions, chopped
      1 tb Capers
           Salt and pepper to taste
    500 g  To 600 g rudderfish
 
  Admittedly, it is not salad weather but this is a particularly hearty
  one and makes an appetising first course or lunch dish.
  
  In a food processor or blender. process together 200 ml extra- virgin
  olive oil, 70 ml lemon juice, 2 cloves garlic. chopped, a generous
  handful of parsley, one small or half a large green capsicum,
  chopped, 3 green (spring) onions, roughly chopped, 1 tablespoon
  capers and salt and pepper to taste. The sauce should be thick - if
  necessary add more of the green ingredients. Poach 500-600 g
  rudderfish gently, preferably in fish stock but at a pinch in water
  with a little lemon juice, just until the fish flakes. Remove from
  the poaching liquid and dry with paper towels. While the fish is
  still quite hot, break it into fairly large chunks, pour the sauce
  over it and turn over gently to coat. Serve the salad as it is or on
  a layer of still-warm sliced new potatoes.

        1 lg green bell pepper, cored,
  :          seeded -- 1/2-inch wide
  :          strips
      1/2 lb fresh mozzarella, cut into
        3    inch by 1/4-inch strips
        1 ts salt
        1 ts sugar
        2 c  polenta -- (cornmeal)
      1/4 c  Parmigiano-Reggiano
        1    terrine mold
  
  Crumble the cooked sausage to resemble rough bread crumbs. Set aside.
  
  In a medium saute pan, heat the olive oil. Gently saute the whole
  garlic cloves until golden brown on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes.
  Add the peppers and saute until soft, but not browned, about 7 to 8
  minutes longer. Remove from heat. Separate and let cool.
  
  Bring the mozzarella to room temperature. Place the sausage, peppers,
  garlic and mozzarella around a cutting board, all in separate bowls.
  
  Bring 6 cups water to a boil, adding the salt and sugar. Slowly add
  the cornmeal to the boiling water in a thin stream, whisking
  continuously. Lower heat and cook until the polenta resembles the
  texture of hot cereal. Remove the pot from heat.
  
  Moving quickly, pour the polenta into the terrine mold about 3/4-inch
  from the top. Sprinkle all the crumbled sausage over the polenta.
  Cover the sausage with about 1-1/2 cups warm polenta. Using a
  spatula, flatten and smooth the polenta to create a flat surface.
  Next, layer the peppers and the garlic cloves. Repeat with another
  layer of 1-1/2 cups warm polenta over the peppers. Remember to smooth
  and flatten the polenta layer to make a nice flat surface all the way
  to the edges. Lay the mozzarella over the polenta (but do not bring
  the mozzarella to the edges). Pour another layer of warm polenta over
  the mozzarella to fill the terrine. Smooth the top layer all the way
  to the edges. There may be left over polenta.
  
  Chill the terrine overnight.
  
  To serve, invert the terrine over a cutting board. It should come out
  quite easily. Slice the terrine as you would slice bread, about
  3/4-inch thick. Place the slice flat on a baking sheet. Bake for 10
  to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with grated cheese and serve immediately.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text file
 
  Oh, but there IS a partially low-fat/VLF vegetarian restaurant in the
  Washington D.C. area! It's called the Vegetable Garden. Located in
  Rockville, it is directly across from the White Flint metro station on
  Rockville Pike, just down the street from White Flint Mall and Fresh
  Fields (which also offers many vegetarian options with its deli
  selection, though they are not necessarily super low fat).
  
  This restaurant has been out of business for six months since they
  recently moved from the mall to its new location. They are a
  completely vegan Chinese restaurant specializing in fake meats. If
  you had ever been to them in their previous location, be prepared for
  some major changes in their menu. They have a whole section of
  "oil-free" dishes, none of which I have ever tried unfortunately.
  They have some very unusual dishes. If you are a mushroom fan, I urge
  you to try the Hen of the Woods dishes (it's a type of mushroom that
  looks similar to oyster, but that are crunchy and firm!).
  
  The restaurant only offers brown rice, and does not have fortune
  cookies. They serve good water, have a juice bar for fresh juices (I
  believe) and they offer Tofutti desserts.
  
  I wish I could visit them more often. I will miss then when I move
  out of state.
  
  There are also two fairly new raw foods restaurants, which are
  probably good places to try and find low fat options. Green City is
  one, which is in Bethesda, and Garden of Delights or something very
  similar, which is in Georgetown.
  
  Vegetarian restaurants are prolific in the D.C. area. Due to PETA
  being in the area, all of the restaurants that offer selections will
  have a "V" sticker in the window/door, which advertise that they
  "carry vegetarian meals."
  
  Good luck! Tara

  I've been to the Delights of the Garden here in Washington, DC. I
  don't want to burst any bubbles, but their food, while very tasty in
  general, is not exactly fat-free - the dishes I had there were all
  doused liberally with oil.  I suppose you could ask them to hold the
  oil, but we found that the service is very 'casual' and sometimes it
  takes several tries to get a 'normal' order right there.  Also, some
  of the dishes are centered around ground nuts - another vlf no-no. We
  found it hard to determine which items were 'legal' on the menu.
  We've had better luck with The Green City Market and Cafe, which is
  owned by the guy who inspired the Delights people in the first place.
  Green City serves deli-style, and the ingredients are all listed in
  plain view for each item. There are many vlf choices, and they serve
  both raw and cooked items, all vegan of course. Green City is in
  Bethesda, MD. Also, the food at Delights is somewhat expensive -
  considering that it's uncooked vegetables. I think your best bet is
  to get their cookbook and modify the recipes for use at home.

  In Union Station (right by the Capitol) there are 30 some-odd "fast
  food" places, including a vegetarian Indian place. It is not ff, but
  the food is great and cheap.
  
  In the Adams Morgan neighborhood near Columbia Rd., there are about 3
  or 4 Ethiopian restaurants with veggie entries on the menu. This is
  some of the best food on the planet!! I especially recommend
  Mescarem, 2434 18th St., NW.  The Red Sea is right across the street
  and is also excellent.
  
  In the DC area there are many Indian restaruants, specifically
  vegetarian Indian Rest.  In the Old Post Office Building on
  Pennsylvania Ave, there is a very neat, small veg. Indian fast food
  place with wonderful menu.
  
  Understand, none of thes are FF places, but, it's worth it.
  
  Good luck.

  Oh, but there IS a partially low-fat/VLF vegetarian restaurant in the
  Washington D.C. area! It's called the Vegetable Garden. Located in
  Rockville, it is directly across from the White Flint metro station on
  Rockville Pike, just down the street from White Flint Mall and Fresh
  Fields (which also offers many vegetarian options with its deli
  selection, though they are not necessarily super low fat).
  
  This restaurant has been out of business for six months since they
  recently moved from the mall to its new location. They are a
  completely vegan Chinese restaurant specializing in fake meats. If
  you had ever been to them in their previous location, be prepared for
  some major changes in their menu. They have a whole section of
  "oil-free" dishes, none of which I have ever tried unfortunately.
  They have some very unusual dishes. If you are a mushroom fan, I urge
  you to try the Hen of the Woods dishes (it's a type of mushroom that
  looks similar to oyster, but that are crunchy and firm!).
  
  The restaurant only offers brown rice, and does not have fortune
  cookies. They serve good water, have a juice bar for fresh juices (I
  believe) and they offer Tofutti desserts.
  
  I wish I could visit them more often. I will miss then when I move

  degrees. Remove from the heat and add and dissolve the yeast in the
  mixture. Wait 3 minutes while the yeast works. Blend in the eggs and
  flour. Knead this soft dough for 10 minutes, adding flour if needed
  to make it firm enough to handle. Place in a greased bowl, cover and
  let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch down and divide into equal
  parts (one part for each finished bagel). Roll each piece into a rope
  about 7" long and tapered at the ends. Wet the ends and form a
  doughnut-shaped ring from each rope. Cover and let rise on a floured
  board for about 15 minutes. Place in a refrigerator for 2 hours to
  firm up the dough. Bring the water to a boil and add the sugar. Drop
  the rings, one at a time, into the boiling sugar water. When the
  bagels surface, turn them over and cook an additional 3 minutes. Skim
  the bagels out of the water and place on an ungreased baking sheet.
  Coat each with beaten egg white. Bake in the oven until golden brown
  (The longer you bake, the crisper the bagel).

 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    213 g  Canned pink Alaska salmon
      3 bn Watercress
           - washed and trimmed
      3    Oranges
      1    Carrot; peeled
           - shredded or thinly sliced
      2 tb Sunflower or sesame oil
      2 ts Sesame seeds
           Seasoning to taste

     15 g  Plain flour
     50 g  Peeled prawns; chopped
     50 g  Button mushrooms; chopped
      4    Eggs; separated
 
  Pre-heat oven to 200 C, 400 F, Gas mark 6.
  
  Drain the can of salmon, reserving the juice. Flake the fish into a
  bowl. Line a 35cm / 14inch by 20cm / 8inch swiss roll tin with
  silicone paper and brush it lightly with oil. Put one bunch of
  watercress into a bowl. Cut two of the oranges into segments and
  squeeze the juice of the third. Mix the orange segments and the
  carrot into the watercress and set aside. Mix together the orange
  juice, oil and sesame seeds. Season lightly.
  
  Melt the margarine in a small pan and stir in the flour. Gradually
  add the salmon stock, stirring to prevent lumps. Stir the prawns and
  mushrooms into the sauce and cook gently for two minutes before
  adding the flaked salmon and mixing well. Set aside.
  
  Chop the remaining two bunches of watercress very finely. Beat the egg
  yolks and chopped watercress together then season. Whisk the egg
  whites until they form soft peaks then fold into the watercress
  mixture. Spread into the lined tin and bake for l0 minutes.
  
  When cooked, loosen the sides of the watercress roulade and quickly
  turn out onto a flat surface. Peel away the silicone paper and spread
  the salmon sauce evenly over the roulade. Quickly roll up, swiss roll
  fashion and trim the edges.
  
  Mix the orange juice dressing into the watercress salad and serve with
  slices of the roulade.

      Title: WATERCRESS BASICS & AN ORANGE CHICORY WALNU
 Categories: Salad, British
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 bn Watercress leaves
      1    Orange -- cut into supremes
           Chicory
           Walnut pieces
           Classic French vinaigrette
 
  "Preparation is a doddle" SPRIGS - you simply slice off the top half,
  complete with a couple of inches of stalk (the rest can be saved to
  flavor vegetable stocks or soups) LEAVES, NO STALKS - you simply
  slash them off clean from the top.
  
  Watercress is best used as quickly as possible, but to prolong its
  vigor, STORE it in the fridge, with the leaves plunged head down into
  a bowl of cold water and the stalks waggling upward. I find this the
  best way to keep it bright and dandy. Watercress is a king among
  garnishes and should always be used with generosity. It brings an
  instant flash of perky color to just about any plate of food, with
  the added bonusthat it contributes a distinct, fresh taste that
  complements not only roast game, but fish, eggs and cheese, as well.
  In salads, it introduces a PEPPERY taste that is every bit as
  appetizing as the ubiquitous arugula. One of my favorites is a
  combination of watercress, orange, chicory and walnuts tossed with a
  little French dressing. Of course, watercress is much more than just
  a garnish or a salad green.... It's also an ingredient for soups and
  sauces.

 Categories: Soups, Herbs
      Yield: 4 Servings

    1/2 md Onion, coarsely
           -chopped
      1 md Potato, roughly
           -diced
    1/2    Garlic clove, chopped
    1/2 oz Butter (or your
           -favourite oil
           -or margarine)
      3 c  Water
      1 tb Heavy cream
           -(or whipping cream)
      1 oz Black caviar (lump
           -fish roe is fine)
      4    Water biscuits
           -(bite-size)
      1 pn Salt and pepper
           -(to taste)
 
  Gently fry onion and garlic in a small amount of butter until
  transparent. Season lightly with salt and pepper, and add water and
  potato and boil until soft.
  
  Pick over watercress and chop 4 or five sprigs and set them aside. Put
  onion and potato mixture in blender and puree. Add most of watercress,
  blend, re-season to taste and return to heat.
  
  Bring mixture to boil and simmer for 2 or three minutes. Stir gently
  to prevent soup from sticking to bottom. Remove from heat.
  
  This is the decision point.  Either set aside to cool, then chill, or
  carry on to serve the soup hot.
  
  Stir in cream and chopped watercress.  Heap a teaspoon of caviar on
  each of the water biscuits and float one on each bowl of soup
  immediately prior to serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Watercress soup, hot or cold -- This thick, creamy soup is equally
  good whether served hot or cold.  I have had watercress soup in
  restaurants, and my mother sometimes makes it, too, but this recipe
  is my own interpretation of the idea. Yield: Serves 4.
  
  *  Use the minimum amount of butter, oil, or margarine that will turn
  the onion transparent.  Those who are particularly diet-conscious
  could dispense with this step, and with the cream. Don't overdo the
  garlic, 1/2 a small clove is ample since it is a background flavour,
  not one that you should be aware of.
  
  *  A caution regarding seasoning.  Potatoes absorb a lot of salt so
  you may find it under-salted.  The caviar on the other hand, is very
  salty. This, for me, is a delightful and important contrast. Guests
  can always add extra salt if they choose.
  
  *  Water biscuits are made by Carr's, amongst others, and can be
  found in most supermarkets, possibly in the gourmet food section.
  They are variously known as water biscuits, water crackers and table
  water crackers. To my mind the best for eating with cheese are the
  high-bake ones, but the regular type are better for this recipe. If
  you can't find them, then any round dry bland low-salt cracker will
  do.
  
  *  A 2 oz jar of lumpfish caviar costs a little under $3.00, but it
  does keep in the fridge so you can get two batches of four servings
  from one jar.  I suppose if budget is a prime consideration one could
  dispense with the caviar, too, but that would be like serving a
  martini without the olives. (Treasonable.)
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes of preparation, 1/2 hour of simmering.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: WATERMELON FRUIT BASKET
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 42 Servings
 
      1    Watermelon
      1 md (5 cups) pineapple, cut into
           -chunks
      1 lg (4 cups) honeydew or
           -cantaloupe melon, cut into
           -chunks or balls
      1 pt (2 cups) strawberries,
           -blueberries, or raspberries
      1 lb (2 cups) green or red grapes
 
  Watermelon Fruit Basket
  
  To prepare watermelon basket, cut a thin slice from bottom of the
  melon so it will sit flat, being careful not to cut through rind to
  melon. With pencil and a 1-1/2 inch wide cardboard guide, draw
  scallop design about 1/3 of the way down from the top of the melon.
  On top 1/3 mark handle. With sharp paring knife, carefully cut
  watermelon to create scallops and handle; Remove top sections. Scoop
  melon into balls or wedges, reserving 6 to 8 cups for fruit basket.
  (Refrigerate remaining melon for other use) Leave shell 1-inch thick.
  Wrap watermelon basket in plastic wrap; refrigerate until ready to
  serve. Fill with fresh fruit just before serving. Makes 42 (1/2-cup)
  servings. (about 30 calories per serving)
  
  TIPS: * Vary the fruit shapes and colors for an attractive salad.
  Include balls, spears, cubes, and triangles.
  
  * To use the most melon pulp, cut chunks or cubes rather than melon
  balls. Use grapes, cherries, and strawberries for round shapes.
  
  * Blueberries and raspberries are best used as a garnigh, since they
  are fragile and bruise easily when tossed with other fruits.
  
  * Sprinkle bananas, apples, and peaches with orange or lemon juice to
  prevent discoloration.

      Title: WATERMELON SALSA
 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Watermelon
      1 bn Cilantro
      1 c  Balsamic Vinegar
      1    Red Onion
 
  Halve the watermelon, scoop out meat.  Seed (this took forever!) cut
  up into presentable pieces, not too big. Save one of the halves to
  serve the salsa in.  Reserve some of the watermelon juice. Chop
  cilantro (watch out for stems!) Chop onion.  Amounts will depend on
  size of the watermelon. I used a fairly small melon and used about
  1/2 bunch of cilantro, one red onion, and a cup each of watermelon
  juice and balsamic vinegar. I also added some jicama for some extra
  crunch.
  
  Mix everthing gently in a large bowl or container, chill, serve in
  watermelon shell, if you like.  It's not complicated, just tedious,
  but worth it!!  Serve as side dish or salad. This does not keep too
  well, it gets slimey in a day or two.

 Categories: Dips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8 oz Cream cheese -- softened
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 ts WATKINS Vanilla
    1/2 ts Caramel Extract
 
  You can use lite or regular cream cheese. I like the already creamed
  variety.  Brown sugar can be increase to 1/3 cup if preferred. As far
  as I know only Watkins makes Caramel Extract.
  
  Mix well all ingredients until very smooth and creamy. Chill and
  serve with sliced apples.  Sliced pears and green seedless grapes are
  also good with this dip. Remember to treat apples with either lemon
  juice or some sort of commercial product that prevents sliced apples
  from turning brown.
  
  This is one of our most popular tasties.  Everyone who tastes it,
  requests the recipe.

      Title: WEBSTER'S NORTH CAROLINA BBQ RIBS
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 c  Water
     12 ts Powdered mustard
      3 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Chili powder
      1 c  Vinegar
      6 ts Salt
      1 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Ground cumin
 
     This is enough sauce for 9 lbs. of ribs (for 6 persons) allowing 1
  1/2 lbs of pork ribs per person.
     Adjust the fire to a "five-second" temperature; that is, you
  should be able to hold you hand where the meat will be for 5 seconds.
     Cooking Time:  Skinny ribs-50 min.; average ribs-60 min.; meaty
  ribs- 70 min.  Every 2-3 minutes, stir the sauce to keep it from
  settling, baste the ribs and turn them. The sauce should run out 4-6
  min. before the end or the cooking time so that the last turn on each
  side should be "dry." Check the temperature frequently and keep it as
  even as possible for the entire cooking time.  A covered grill is
  desirable for temperature controll and also improves the flavor by
  smoking the meat as the the cooking proceeds. Thee success of this
  recipe depends on slow cooking at a moderate temperature, with
  frequent basting.  Grease flare-ups should be suppressed with water
  to avoid charring.
     In some parts of North Carolina, a liquid resembling water is used
  for refreshment, fueling cars and other purposes. Do not accidentally
  use it for suppressing the fire unless you want to finish your meal
  in Georgia.

  Wedding Torte #1 Lemon Genoise
  
  From:  The Detroit News Sent By: Teresa Marco
  
  Preheat oven to 350o.  In mixer or copper bowl, beat whites to a stiff
  snow; slowly add sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.
  
  In separate bowl, whisk yolks and mix in lemon zest. Slowly fold the
  two mixtures together.
  
  Sift together flour and baking powder, and slowly fold into egg
  mixture. Fold in melted butter.
  
  Pour into 10" greased and floured cake pan.  Bake for 25-30 mins. or
  until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Turn cake
  onto clean linen tea towel to cool.
  
  BAKED HAZELNUT MERINGUE
  
  4 egg whites 2/3 C sugar, divided 1 C + 1 tsp ground hazelnuts (or
  almonds) 1/3 C flour 2 tsp cocoa powder
      1/3 c  cornstarch
  
  Preheat oven to 350o.  Whisk egg whites until firm, gradually adding a
  little less than half of the sugar. Carefully fold in ground
  hazelnuts, flour, cocoa powder, cornstarch and remaining sugar. Pour
  into greased and paper-lined 10" cake pan.  Bake for 20 mins or until
  a toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean. Turn onto rack and
  cool.
  
  BAVARIAN CREAM
  
  1/3 qt. half and half 1/4 C sugar 4 egg yolks 5 sheets gelatin or 1
  TBSP + 1/2 tsp unflavored granulated gelatin (if using sheets, soak
  for 20 mins. in cold water and squeeze dry; if using granulated,
  dissolve in 4 TBSP cold water) 1 oz. fruit liqueur (Grand Marnier,
  Triple Sec, etc.) or rum 1/2 qt. whipping cream
  
  Reserve 1/2 C of the half and half and mix with yolks. Set aside.
  Bring remaining half and half and sugar to a boil and stir in yolk
  mixture; reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often, until custard
  coats back of a wooden spoon. Stir in granulated gelatin or softened
  sheets and remove from heat to cool.
  
  When custard begins to set, stir until smooth.  Add liqueur and fold
  in stiffly whipped cream.  (If making a day ahead of time, cover
  surface with plastic wrap and chill. Stir before you use it. Partoens
  feels it's best, however, when made early the same day.)

  small jar raspberry or strawberry jam Assorted fresh fruit:
  pineapple; variety of berries, sliced kiwi, and peaches whatever you

 Categories: Meats, Cyberealm, Kooknet
      Yield: 15 Patties
 
      5 lb Lean ground beef
  3 1/2 oz Baby food strained veal
  3 1/2 oz Baby food strained beef
 10 1/2 oz Campbell's beef broth
      1 ts Onion salt
      1 ts Seasoned salt
    1/2 ts Lemon pepper
    1/2 ts Finely crushed dry minced
           -onions (use a hammer to
           -flatten them)
      2 tb Cup of Soup Tomato Flavor
           -Soup Powder
 
  Mix all of the ingredients together thoroughly, covering your hands
  with plastic food bags to knead it well. Or dig right in like Grandma
  did, remember that fingers were made before forks! Shape into patties
  by measuring out 2/3's cupful of mixture for each & keeping them
  about 1/2" thick & square in shape, about the size of a Graham
  cracker. The mixture makes about 15 patties, which can be
  individually wrapped and frozen, to be thawed about 30 minutes at
  room temperature or more quickly on "defrost" in the microwave oven
  per manufacturer's directions. They freeze well up to 6 months.  Do
  not refrigerate for more than 2 days.

  You have to eat this at the weekend simply because it is so incredibly
  garlicky as to be anti-social to anyone who has not eaten it! For all
  its simplicity, it is among the most delicious of pasta dishes.
  
  Stir the crushed garlic into the olive oil and add masses of freshly
  ground black pepper. Mix into the hot, drained tagliatelle and toss
  thoroughly. Finally mix in the pine nuts, give it all another toss
  and serve immediately with a crisp green salad.

      Title: WEGGELITEIG (BUTTON ROLLS)
 Categories: Swiss, Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Hot water (120-130F)
      1 c  Nonfat dry milk
      2 tb Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      5 c  All-purpose or bread flour
      2    Pkg. dry yeast
      2 tb Each lard & veg. shortening
      1    Egg, beaten, mixed with a
           - pinch of salt
 
  Grease a large baking sheet (or have ready a Teflon one).
  
  In a large mixing or mixer bowl pour the hot water and add the milk,
  sugar, salt and 2 cups flour.  Stir to blend. Add the yeast: stir.
  Measure in the shortening.  (The recipe's creator, a Swiss baker,
  insists that half of the shortening should be lard if you're
  attempting to duplicate the original flavor.) If working by hand,
  beat with a wooden spoon: if in a mixer, use the flat beater.  When
  the shortening has been blended into the heavy batter, add the
  balance of the flour, half a cup at a time, until the dough is a
  shaggy mass and can be worked with the hands or under the dough hook.
  
  Knead for 8 minutes by hand or in the mixer, until the dough is soft
  and elastic.
  
  Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap,
  and set aside until it has doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.
  
  Turn dough from the bowl, and punch down.
  
  Divide the dough into 24 pieces, and roll each into a ball until any
  seams disappear.  When each ball is round and cohesive, fashion it
  into a long roll - 4 to 5 inches -- by pushing it back and forth
  under your flattened palm with considerable pressure.  Place the
  rolls end to end on the baking sheet with a three-inch space between
  the parallel rows. If there is dough for more rolls than the baking
  sheet will accomodate, reserve it and repeat this step when the sheet
  and oven are available.
  
  Cover the rolls with wax paper and leave undisturbed for 40 minutes.
  Then brush each roll with the egg/salt mixture. Leave uncovered for
  another 20 minutes.  At the end of the hour, brush again with the
  glaze.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F.
  
  When the rolls have been brushed for the second time, face the long
  side of the rolls.  Hold scissors at a 45-degree angle, and snip 5
  triangular cuts across each roll, about 1" long, down the center of
  each roll. The points of the cuts will rise, forming "buttons". Dip
  the scissors in water frequently so the points don't stick to the
  glaze.
  
  When all the rolls have been cut, place the baking sheet on the
  center rack of the oven.  Halfway through baking, turn the sheet end
  for end to equalize the heat on the rolls. They are done when glossy
  brown, 35 minutes.  Turn a roll over and tap the bottom crust to make
  sure the crust is firm.
  
  Place on a rack to cool somewhat before serving.

 Categories: Mexican, Beans
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Beans, cooked (3-1/2 to 4
           -cups with broth)
           A 10 inch frying pan
      6 tb Melted lard or pork
           -drippings
    1/4    Onion, finely chopped
      2 oz Queso fresco, crumbled (I
           -used shredded Monterery
           -Jack)
     12    Totopos (fried tortillas, or
           -tortilla chips)
           Some romaine lettuce leaves
      6    Radish roses
 
  Heat the lard and fry the onion, without browning, until it is soft.
  
  Add 1 cup of the beans and their broth to the pan and mash them well
  over a very high flame. (With a bean masher or wooden potato masher)
  Add the rest of the beans gradually, mashing them all the time, until
  you have a course puree.
  
  When the puree begins to dry out and sizzle at the edges, it will
  start to come away from the surface of the pan. As you let it
  continue cooking, tip the pan from side to side. The puree will form
  itself into a loose roll. This will take from 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Tip the roll, rather like folding an omelet, onto the serving dish and
  garnish with the cheese.  Spike it with the crisp triangles of
  tortillas. Decorate.

 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
      1 lb Self-raising flour
      2 oz Butter
      4 oz Sugar
      4 oz Sultanas and raisins
      2    Eggs
    1/3 pt Water
 
  On sale in every Welsh bakery, these are one of the great delights of
  teatime.  The are easy to make.  The Welsh use a flat iron "planc" (a
  griddle) to bake the cakes, which are cooked on top heat like Scotch
  pancakes.  A heavy frying pan will do fine if you don't have a
  griddle. Makes 15-18 cakes.
  
  Rub the fat into the flour and add the fruit and sugar. Mix the water
  with the eggs and use to make a soft dough just a little firmer than
  that for the scones. Tip on to a well-floured board and roll out to a
  thickness of 1/2-inch.  Cut out circles with a 2-1/2-inch shell-edged
  cutter.
  
  Heat a planc or heavy iron frying pan - get the heat up into it
  gently and thoroughly, and do not let it overheat. If the pan is not
  well-seasoned or non-stick, slick it with a little butter or
  vegetable oil.
  
  Bake the cakes on the pan, turning them once, until well-risen and
  lightly browned.  They will take about 5 minutes each side. Eat hot
  or cold, with or without salty butter, but always with a cup of
  piping-hot tea.

 Categories: Main dish, Cheese/eggs, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 c  Grated sharp cheddar cheese
      6 fl Beer; at room temperature
      2    Egg yolks; beaten
    1/8 ts Cayenne
      1 ts Dijon mustard
    3/4 c  Walnuts
      2    Apples
     16    Broccoli spears
      8 sl Bread
 
  Heat the grated cheese in the top of a double boiler. Mix the warm
  beer with the beaten egg yolks.  When the cheese has melted, slowly
  stir in the egg-beer mixture. Add the cayenne and mustard. Stir until
  smooth.
  
  Chop and toast the walnuts.  Slice the apples thinly. Steam the
  broccoli spears until tender but still bright. Toast the bread.
  
  For each serving of rarebit, start with two slices of toast. The
  general idea is to cover the toast with broccoli and apples, pour
  cheese sauce over them, and top with walnuts. However, I like to put
  apple slices between two slices of toast, top with broccoli spears,
  cover with cheese, and garnish with nuts.

  slightly thicker than commercial bread, is preferrable. Variety
  home-made breads would vary texture and flavour. 6. Drape 1 to 2

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      5 c  Flour
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 tb Salt
      1 tb Butter or margarine
    1/2 ts Baking soda
           Water (warm)
 
  For the starter:  In a clean, SCALDED container, mix 2 cups of flour
  and 1 cup of warm water.  Cover with plastic wrap, and let stand at
  room temperature for 2 ~ 3 days until an amber liquid forms. When
  this happens, stir the starter and, following manufacturer's
  instructions, place in bread pan:
  
  1/2 c Starter 3 c Flour 1 c Warm water 1 T Sugar 1/2 T Salt 1 T
  Butter 1/2 t Baking Soda
  
  Use the basic dough cycle.  When cycle is completed, allow doughball
  to rest and rise in ABM for a minimum of 4 hours. Six hours is
  better. After the rest/rise time, bake using your machine's
  whole-wheat cycle.
  
  Meanwhile, feed your starter with 1/2 cup flour, 1 cup warm water,
  and 1 t sugar.  Mix, cover, and place in refrigerator. Use or feed on
  a regular basis to keep it alive and well. As your starter matures
  and ages, it will develop its own unique flavor.  Take care of your
  starter, it will take care of you.

      1 ea Basic pizza dough *
      2 c  Chili **
      6 oz Mild Longhorn Cheddar cheese
           (grated)
    1/4 c  Onion (very thinly sliced)
    1/2 ea Green Bell pepper (chopped)
      1 oz Ripe black olives, sliced
    1/2 lb Pork sausage
      9 ea Medium-sized mushrooms,
           Sliced
 
  *   Pizza dough is very subjective.  I won't attempt a recipe here,
      just make your favorite dough for 1 large pizza.
  
  **  NO BEANS IN THE CHILI!  If you must use canned, I recommend a 15
      oz. can of Wolf Brand Chili.  This will work very nicely.
  
  Directions:
  
  1.  Saute the sausage, mushrooms (stems and caps), and Bell pepper
      until very lightly browned.
  
  2.  Preheat oven to 500 deg F.
  
  3.  Roll pizza dough into a pizza-like shape, and add toppings in
      this order:
  
  :            Chili
  :            Sausage, 'shrooms, and peppers
  :            Olives
  :            Onions
  :            Cheese
  
  4.  Bake for 15-20 minutes.  Use a pizza stone if you have one. If
      you don't have one, get one!

  Make a batter of the flour, egg yolk, milk, salt, and sugar. Beat the
  egg whites, and add to the mixture. Take five wooden spoons and stick
  the handles about 1/3 to 3/4 inch deep into the dough, twisting the
  handles as you do so.  Immediately transfer them to fat that has been
  heated to 390 degrees F.  As soon as the dough has browned, once
  again dip into the dough, then back into the hot fat. Repeat the
  process 5 to 6 times. When the very outside layer has turned crisp
  and brown, remove the pastry from the spoon handle, fill with honey,
  and serve hot, dusted with crushed sugar.

      Title: WEST COAST FRENCH SOURDOUGH BREAD I
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 c  Starter
      1 pk Dry yeast
    3/4 c  Flour
      3 c  Flour
    3/4 c  Water
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Soda
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
      2 c  Flour
      2 ts Sugar
 
  About 9:00 in the evening measure out 1 cup starter from the
  refrigerator storage jar into mixing bowl (do not use metal or
  plastic). Add 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup flour and beat thoroughly.
  Cover bowl tightly with clinging transparent wrap and set in warm
  place (80 to 85) overnight.
  
  In the morning about 7:00 beat starter thoroughly. Measure out 1 cup
  and return remaining starter to storage jar. In another bowl pour
  1-1/2 cups of just warm water, stir in 2 tsp. sugar and sprinkle 1
  pkg. yeast on top. Let stand until yeast is dissolved. Add the 1 cup
  of reserved starter and 3 cups flour. Beat thoroughly, cover tightly
  and let stand in warm place until very light and foamy. This will
  take from 1 to
    1-1/2    hours.
  
  Sift 2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. soda with 1 cup flour and spread the
  remaining 1 cup on the pastry board. Stir the sifted flour mix into
  the sponge.  Turn out on board and knead for several minutes using a
  little more flour if necessary to make a very stiff dough. Knead
  until completely smooth and not sticky so that it can be worked on an
  unfloured portion of the board without sticking. Divide in halves and
  shape into either round or long narrow loaves. Place on flat baking
  sheet, preferably non stick, or lightly grease it or sprinkle corn
  meal over the surface. Slip into large plastic bag, supported so that
  it will not touch dough (drinking glasses placed at each end of sheet
  are fine). Set in warm place for 1 to 1-1/2 hours to rise.
  
  If the dough becomes too light the loaves will spread in baking but
  this only makes a more delicious crust. When ready for the oven brush
  top of loaves with cold water. Make diagonal slashes across top of
  long loaves and five or six radiating from center of round ones with
  a sharp single-edge razor blade or scissors. Bake in oven preheated
  to 400 degrees with pan of hot water on the floor from 50 to 60
  minutes and the crust is as dark as desired. About 10 minutes before
  the end of the baking period, brush tops with water again. Remove
  from pans and stand on edge to cool, propping them against a heavy
  glass jar or similar object.
  
  For the most attractive slices, especially if the loaves have spread a
  little to much in baking, cut with a very sharp knife diagonally
  across the long loaf and at the same time have the blade slanted from
  top to bottom away from the end. This makes the slices about twice as
  wide as when cut straight up and down. Cut slices from the round
  loaves on the slant also. When ready to seve, to preserve the utterly
  delicious taste and crisp, hard crust, re-heat quickly with wrapping
  open at one end so that the bread will not become steamy, or spread
  slices with butter and place under broiler at high heat for a very
  short period until the edges are beginning to brown nicely. This
  recipe makes 2 long or 2 large round loaves.

      Title: WEST INDIES HOT CURRY SAUCE
 Categories: Other sauce
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     12    To 15 habanero (Scotch
           -- Bonnet) chile peppers
           -- roughly chopped
      1    Ripe mango; peeled
           -- pitted and mashed
      1 c  Cheap yellow mustard
    1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
    1/4 c  White vinegar
      1 tb Curry powder
      1 tb Ground cumin
      1 tb Chili powder
    1/2 ts Salt; or to taste
      1 ts Black pepper; or to taste
 
  WARNING: Hottest sauce in North America. Use this to enhance dull and
  boring food. Keep away from pets, open flames, unsupervised children,
  and bad advice. This is not a toy. This is serious. Stand up
  straight, sit right, and stop mumbling. Be careful not to rub your
  nose, eyes, or mouth while working with habaneros. You may actually
  want to wear rubber gloves while chopping and mixing -- these babies
  are powerful.
  
  Mix all the ingredients together and stand back. This will keep,
  covered and refrigerated, until the year
    2018. Be careful though: If it spills, it will eat a hole in your
  refrigerator. If you ever want to dispose of it, call the local toxic
  waste specialists.
  
  NOTES : This style of hot sauce, widely used in the West Indies, is
  basically habanero peppers (also known as Scotch Bonnets), fruit, and
  yellow mustard, with a few other ingredients thrown in. Use this
  recipe as a guideline. Habaneros are at the top of the chile pepper
  heat scale, so feel free to substitute other peppers of your choice.
  
  Funnel the sauce into an old pint liquor bottle, then let your
  imagination run free as to what whopper you can lay on your guests
  regarding its origins. If you're having trouble, here's a start: "One
  day in Jamaica I was in this dingy bar and met this old guy who..."
  and you take it from there.

      2 tb Cornstarch
 
  (sweet-sour Hangchow dish, adapted from Joyce Chen's restaurant)
  
  * other fresh-water fish may be substituted; a small striper may be
  substituted in a pinch; look for 15-18" (1 1/2 to 2 lb) fish,
  preferably one you caught yourself. You could also probably use 2 or
  3 bluegills
  
  ** substitute cider vinegar, white wine vinegar, or possibly balsamic
  
  Clean, gut, scale, and rinse fish. Cut through skin three diagonal
  cuts on each side like so /// .
  
  Put fish, sherry, and ginger slices into kettle of boiling water.
  Water should cover the fish. Cover tightly and immediately turn off
  heat. Let stand 15 min.
  
  Meanwhile, mix all the rest of the ingredients and cook over
  medium-high heat until sauce thickens. Remove garlic if used. Keep
  very hot.
  
  Remove fish carefully from water. Drain and gently pat dry. Pour
  boiling sauce over and serve immediately.
  
  Variation: cut sugar to 1 T; cut vinegar to 2 T. Increase soy sauce
  to 3 T; add 2 T dry sherry to sauce ingredients; add 2 T chicken
  broth to sauce ingredients. This obviously is no longer West Lake
  fish but a more standard soy sauce fish.

      Title: WESTERN BARBECUE JERKY
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Brown sugar
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/3 c  Red wine vinegar
    1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/3 c  Ketchup
      1 ts Onion powder
      1 lb Lean meat
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Dry mustard
 
  Slice meat into long strips 3/16 to 1/4 inch thick. Uniform slices
  will shorten the drying time, so use a meat slicer or have your
  butcher slice it for you. Cut across the grain for increased
  tenderness. Remove excess fat. In a small bowl, combine all
  ingredients except meat. Stir to mix well. Place meat 3 or 4 layers
  deep in a glass, stoneware, plastic or stainless steel container,
  spooning vinegar mixture over each layer. Cover tightly. Marinate 6
  to 12 hours in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally and keeping
  the mixture tightly covered. Place the meat strips on drying racks.
  Do not overlap the strips to ensure good air circulation. Oven
  temperature should be 140 to 160 F (60 to 70 C) for the first 8 to 10
  hours. After that it may be lowered to 130 F (55C) until dry. Place
  aluminum foil or a baking sheet underneath the drying tray to catch
  the drippings. Occasionally blot the jerky with paper towels as it
  dries to remove beads of oil. Test jerky for dryness by cooling a
  piece. When cool it should crack when bent but not break. There
  should be no moist spots.

  Makes 8 servings; about 2 quarts.
  
  A BAG OF BEAN TRICKS:
  
  A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.
  
  Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
  thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways
  of preparing dry beans for cooking. All start with a thorough
  inspection for damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in
  cold water. The next step, which is highly recommended, is soaking
  the beans. This not only helps make the beans cook faster, it also
  improves flavor, texture, appearance and digestibility. For maximum
  improvement of these factors, it is recommended that the soak water
  be discarded and the beans rinsed and cooked in fresh water.
  
  SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.
  
  For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
  Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so
  be sure to start with a large enough pot. (Note: up to 2 teaspoons of
  salt per pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water
  more evenly.) Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
  from heat, cover and set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak
  method), but *preferably* four hours or more.  The longer soaking
  time is recommended to allow a greater amount of the gas-causing
  properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping the beans to be
  more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects. Whether you soak
  the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to DISCARD THE SOAK
  WATER.
  
  COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)
  
  Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
  kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
  teaspoons salt. Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness
  is reached.
  
  Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons
  onion salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt. Add 1
  Tablespoon chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4
  teaspoon white pepper.
  
  * Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.
  
  * Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.
  
  * Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans whe
  cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.
  
  * At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker
  helps, but follow manufacturer's directions. [Personal note: Tom says
  1/2 hour in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to
  cooking them overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure
  cooker, as they expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)
  
  * Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or
  kidney beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings,
  lard, oil, butter or margarine.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Canned pumpkin
  2 1/4 c  Whipping cream
      1 ea Vanilla bean, split in half
      7 ea Egg yolks
      1 c  Granulated sugar; divided
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
      1 tb Chopped crystallized ginger
 
  Caprial Pence, co-owner and chef at Westmoreland Bistro, included the
  recipe for this special holiday dessert in her latest cookbook,
  "Caprial's Cafe". This will be a nice change from pumpkin pie for
  Christmas.
  
  In a heavy saucepan over medium temperature, heat the pumpkin puree,
  cream and vanilla bean halves to a boil and set aside.
  
  Place the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a medium stainless
  steel bowl (or the top of a double boiler) and place the bowl over a
  pot of barely simmering water. Whisk constantly until the mixture
  forms a ribbon when you lift the whisk, about 6 or 8 minutes. Be
  careful not to scramble the egg mixture.
  
  Slowly whisk in hot pumpkin mixture to the egg mixture and stirring
  frequently, cook over medium heat until the mixture has the
  consistency of softly whipped cream, 40 to 50 minutes. Add the
  cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and ginger and mix well. Pour into 6
  custard cups and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight.
  
  When ready to serve, sprinkle each custard with 4 teaspoons sugar and
  place under a preheated broiler for 2 or 3 minutes or until sugar is
  browned. Serve immediately.

      Title: WHAT IS AN USA FOOD EXCHANGE
 Categories: Diabetic, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Info/help
 
 
  What is an USA Food Exchange?
  
  It's like trading  5 pennies for 1 nickel or 10 dime for a dollar
  bill. Right!  Okay.  In food exchanges, you may exchanges one
  measurement or amount of food for another food in the same group, ie,
  if by change, such as I do...I have a 1/2 grapefruit every
  morning...let's say I ran out! I would look over the fruit exchange
  list to see what was there that I could have from the exchange group
  of the fruit list...then I could choose something from the fruit
  exchange.. Ah! Ha! I see I can sneak one of Bert's orange's. (2 1/2"
  across)= 1/2 cup fresh fruit.
  
  The Food Exchange System is based on six exchanges lists: Starch/bread
  exchange, meat, vegetables, fruits, milk, and fats. There is also some
  special lists. Foods are grouped within each list on the basis of
  similar amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. For example, one
  fruit exchange is CHO: 15g, PRO: 0g; FAT: 0g; CAL: 60; This
  equivalent to 1/2 cup of grapefruit juice, but only a 1/3 cup of
  prune juice because prune juice has more sugar then grapefruit juice.
  Keep in mind that there will be some surprises. Corn, for example, is
  a vegetable, but it appears on the starch/bread list.  That is
  because corn is starchy and its carbohydrate value is much closer to
  bread then to most vegetables. Foods from the starch/bread list is
  sometimes called STARCH EXCHANGE and sometimes called the  BREAD
  EXCHANGE---but they mean the same thing.

      Title: WHAT IS GLUTEN
 Categories: Info/tips, Breadmaker
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        -PETER PARK JR   (VNKJ85A)
  
   Let's clarify the distinction between GLUTEN and the DEVELOPING of
  Gluten through mixing and kneading (what Jackie calls "making
  Gluten"):
  
  ++  GLUTEN (also called 'VITAL GLUTEN') is one of several components
  of the wheat berry that is milled to make flour. It is high in
  protein and contributes to a lighter bread, higher rise, and
  IMPORTANTLY for those of us at high altutude, an elastic quality that
  reduces the liklihood of a rising loaf falling (like a balloon
  bursting because the rubber won't stretch anymore) -- GLUTEN gives
  the dough more stretch.
  
  ++  DEVELOPING THE GLUTEN (what Jackie describes) is the result of
  mixing and kneading that results in the elastic properties described
  above being developed in dough from Gluten in it. By hand kneading,
  or by kneading in an automatic breadmaker, the elasticity that Jackie
  described develops ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT GLUTEN IS PRESENT in the
  flour.
  
  ++  Various flours have more or less GLUTEN present -- All flour has
  some GLUTEN (or VITAL GLUTEN) -- Bread Flour has considerably more
  Gluten -- this is good for bread making and bad for cake making and
  other uses (which is why there are other types of flour (e.g. ALL
  PURPOSE FLOUR) ++ The ADDITION of GLUTEN (VITAL GLUTEN) beyond what
  is already in the flour is for several reasons: -- It is added to ALL
  PURPOSE flour to give it the GLUTEN amount already in BREAD FLOUR.
  For some this is economics, since ALL PURPOSE FLOUR with Gluten added
  is often cheaper than BREAD FLOUR.
   -- It is added to BREAD FLOUR to give extra rise and consistency
  (that is why bakers use it) -- It is added at high altutudes to
  provide extra elasticity. The chemical reason has to do with reduced
  density (pressume) at high elevations which causes the 'bubble' of
  rising bread to [fall] if the dough lacks extra elasticity. ADDED
  Gluten is nice for some - critical at high Alt.
  
  ++   GLUTEN (or VITAL GLUTEN) is available at health food stores for
  use for the reasons noted above.
   -- Many health food stores have it in bulk -- Most also have it in
  boxes especially ARROWHEAD MILLS IN A 10 oz box ($ 2.19 to $2.69

      Title: WHAT YOUR PIZZA SAYS ABOUT YOU
 Categories: Info, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Info
 
      1    Pizza facts
 
  WONDER what the Domino's people do when they're not rushing pizzas
  all over creation? They take surveys, or they say they do. The
  company's mighty public relations machine offers these observations:
  
  Men wearing muscle shirts when answering the door order pepperoni
  three times more often than any other topping.
  
  People who have pierced noses, lips or eyebrows ask for a vegetarian
  topping 23 percent more often than a meat topping. Those who have wind
  chimes on the porch are four times more likely than the average to
  want olives.
  
  A recurring element is the correlation between pizza-eating and
  TV-watching. Whatever day and time ''Roseanne" airs is always the
  biggest half-hour of the week for meat-topped pizza orders. Since you
  asked, the No. 1 pizza-ordering show (figured by comparing orders
  during its time slot with weeks when the show doesn't air) is
  "Melrose Place," which is also by far the leading show for
  vegetable-topped pizzas. Pizza orders in the "Melrose Place" time
  slot have gone up 14 percent since Heather Locklear joined the cast.
  
  There's more: As you look back on 1994, trying to make sense of
  Newt's rise and O.J.'s fall, you may want to consider these other
  statistics from Domino's Since the Republicans won the election,
  meat-topped pizza orders have risen 32 percent in the Washington
  metropolitan area. Since Election Day, tipping of Domino's deliverers
  by Washington women has fallen off by 10 percent (except during
  "Melrose Place," when it climbs by 30 percent).
  
  Since the election, tipping by House Republicans has been down 12
  percent; tipping by House Democrats has been up 3 percent. Whenever
  Newt Gingrich appears on national television, pizza orders to
  Democratic offices go up 4 percent and go down 2 percent on the GOP
  side.
  
  And last, but not least The single greatest hour for pizza delivery in
  national pizza history was the hour when O. J. Simpson was in the
  white Ford Bronco on the L. A. freeways.

  Butter a 10" tube pan and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine
  the yeast, 1 tsp. of the sugar and the warm water. Set aside for 10
  minutes. Combine the milk, butter, oil, zest, remainider of the sugar
  and salt. Stir into the yeast mixture. Add the egg yolks, stirring
  well. Add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each
  addition to incorporate the flour thoroughly. Knead 5-10 minutes,
  until the dough is smooth, elastic and satiny. Knead in the
  cranberries and pecans. Put the dough back in the bowl,  cover the
  bowl and let the dough rise at room temperature until it is doubled
  in bulk. Using a wooden spoon, beat down the risen dough for about a
  minute. Place the dough into the buttered tube pan and allow it to
  rise at room temperature until it is doubled in bulk. Preheat the
  oven to 375=B0. Bake the bread for 45-50 minutes or until it is dark
  golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped. Place on a rack to cool
  or serve warm. Once cooled, the bread is also excellent sliced and
  toasted.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Cracked wheat or wheat
           Berries
      2 c  Chopped tomatoes
      1 c  Chopped cucumbers
      1 x  Chopped purple onion
        x  Fatfree yogurt
        x  Balsamic vinegar
        x  Sugar
 
  start with 2 cups of cooked cracked wheat.  I just boil it until its
  done. Actually I think you are supposed to use boiled wheat berries.
  Add an equal amount of chopped tomatoes and half as much chopped
  cucumbers and chopped purple onion to taste. For dressing I use
  fatfree yogurt with basimaic vinegar and some sugar. Yogurt or sour
  cream with dried italian salad dressing would also be good.

      Title: WHEAT BERRY WHIZZES
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 35 Servings
 
  1 1/3 c  Raw wheat berries (whole
           Wheat kernels)
      4 c  Water for either soaking or
           Cooking the wheat berries
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
    1/4 c  Oil
    1/2 c  Whole wheat or all-purpose
           Flour
           Oil for brushing the tops
           Salt for the tops (opt.)
 
  "These crackers have an intense wheat flavor that comes from using the
  whole grain. Enjoy them alone or with fresh fruit, such as pears and
  peaches. 350~F. 25 to 30 minutes
  
  Cover the wheat berries with the water and soak overnight. Or, if you
  want to make the crackers the same day, cook the berries in the water
  over a moderate heat for 20 minutes, or until they are tender. Drain
  the berries in a sieve for 10 minutes. They should be well drained,
  but not dry.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350~F.
  
  Put the wheat berries into the food processor and process them to a
  pulp. If you do not have a food processor, use your blender,
  processing about 1/3 cup at a time. Blend until there are no whole
  berries left. Place the pulp in a large bowl and blend in the egg and
  the oil.
  
  With your hands, work in enough of the flour to form a dough that
  will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide it into 2 equal
  portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out
  to a thickness of 3/16 inch.
  
  Cut the dough into 2- by 3-inch rectangles. With a metal spatula,
  transfer the individual crackers to an ungreased baking sheet. This
  dough has a tendency to tear before it is baked, so treat it gently.
  Be sure to cut all the way through the dough before trying to lift
  the crackers.
  
  Brush the tops with oil and sprinkle lightly and evenly with salt, if
  desired. Bake for 15 minutes. Turn the crackers over, brush the tops
  again, and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are
  lightly browned. Cool on racks. Yield: 30-35.
  
  VARIATION: If you like cinnamon toast, try the following: After
  turning and brushing, sprinkle a little sugar and cinnamon on the
  freshly brushed tops and continue to bake as directed.

      1    Clove garlic, sliced in half
 
  Cut peanut butter or tahini into gluten flour (as you would
  shortening in corn meal - this is my enhancement). Stir in
  nutritional yeast, cumin powder, coriander, garlic powder, onion
  powder, salt and pepper, mixing well.
  
  Add tamari and oil to one c of water and pour into gluten mix. Knead
  into a rough ball and place into a slow cooker (crock pot) that has
  been sprayed with non-stick spray.
  
  Mix additional water (1 & 1/4 c) and cider vinegar and pour over
  gluten. (I sometimes add about a tb and/or tamari of liquid smoke to
  add a bit of flavor.  How about basil? Sprinkle it on. What the heck.)
  
  Top gluten ball with margarine and garlic halves.
  
  Cook in slow cooker on low setting for 5-7 hours.
  
  Slice thinly and serve as you would roast beef. Makes great fajitas
  and stir-fry pieces.
  
  Note:  This recipe can also be cooked in a covered dish in a 250
  degree F. oven for 3-4 hours.
  
  Note:  Makes a "leg of wheat" roast that weighs approx. two pounds.
  Double the mix for four pounds but cook in 6-quart size crock pot.
  
  At the urging of DEEANNE, I am sharing a secret recipe with you. I
  _hope_ it comes out for you.  If it doesn't, please keep it as your
  secret!
  
  (The basics of this concoction are from Shirley Wilkes-Johnson's
  cooking class.  Of course, I've added some enhancements. I can't
  leave well enough alone.)

      Title: WHEAT STARCH DOUGH
 Categories: China
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Wheat starch
    2/3 c  Tapioca starch
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Oil
      1 c  Boiling water + 2 Tbsp.
 
   TO MAKE DOUGH: Mix well the first 4 ingredients in order given. Bring
  water to a rolling boil and stir into dry ingredients with chopsticks
  until dry ingredients adhere. Cover and let it cool for 15 minutes.
  Lightly oil kneading surface and knead dough for several minutes,
  until dough is well mixed and smooth. Now it is ready for wrapping.
  DO-AHEAD NOTES: Dough can be kept at room temperature for 1 day if
  you wrap it in plastic wrap. But Ms. Yee usually has fillings ready
  for wrapping right away.
  
   COMMENTS: It is very important that the water for the dough be
  boiling vigorously for several minutes before mixing with the
  starches. One sure way to have just the right amount of water is by
  first having a larger quantity than is called for in the recipe.
  Bring water to a rolling boil for 5 minutes then measure off the
  proper amount, return the water to the emptied pot, bring it to a
  vigorous boil again, adding to starch mixture right away. If the
  water is cooled off even for just a few seconds. the starch will not
  get cooked and the dough will fall apart. (You'll see the dough
  taking on a chalky white appearance instead of a transparent look.
  This indicates it is properly cooked.) To insure dough is rolled
  evenly, a tortilla press will work wonders! (See recipes for Ha Gow
  and Steamed Pork Turnovers). Yield: 3-4 doz. wrappers.

      Title: WHEAT STARCH WRAPPERS FOR DUMPLINGS
 Categories: Chinese
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
      1 c  Wheat starch
    1/4 c  Tapioca starch
      1 c  Boiling water
      1 tb Peanut oil plus more to oil
           The wrappers
 
       Combine the wheat starch and tapioca starch in a mixing bowl.
  When the water reaches a boil immediately pour it into the flour and
  stir vigorously into a ball, with a wooden spoon.  The hot boiling
  water cooks the starches.  Add the oil to the dough and mix together
  as well as possible. The dough at this point is quite thick and lumpy.
  
       While hot, gather up the dough and knead on a lightly oiled
  surface until smooth and well blended, about 3 minutes. It should
  feel a bit rubbery and putty-like. Cover with a damp towel.
  
       Dough is ready to make Ha Gow or Fun Gwau.
  
  Makes enough dough for 2 1/2 dozen Ha Gow or Fun Gwau dumplings.

           Margarine, softened
    2/3 c  Milk
           Salt for the tops (opt.)
 
  Preheat the oven to 325~ F. "Just the thing to nibble with a cup of
  mulled wine or hot spiced apple cider, these simple, versatile
  crackers also lend themselves beautifully to cheeses, dips, and spicy
  spreads. 325~ F 20 to 25 minutes In a large bowl or in the food
  processor, combine the flours, sugar, and salt. Cut the butter into
  the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in the milk
  slowly, using only enough to form a dough that will hold together in
  a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling.
  On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll the crackers thin, 1/16 to
  1/8 inch. If desired, lightly sprinkle the tops with salt and gently
  roll over the dough with your rolling pin. With a sharp knife, cut
  the crackers into 2-inch squares. Transfer them to an ungreased
  baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a
  fork. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the crackers are lightly
  browned. Cool on a rack. Yield: 95-100.

 Categories: Poem, Midwestern
      Yield: 1 Poem
 
 
  When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock, And
  you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin' turkey-cock And the
  clackin' of the guineys, and the cluckin' of the hens, And the
  rooster's hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence; O, it's then's the
  times a feller is a-feelin' at his best, With the risin' sun to greet
  him from a night of peaceful rest, As he leaves the house,
  bareheaded, and goes out to feed the stock, When the frost is on the
  punkin and the fodder's in the shock.
  
  They's something kindo' harty-like about the atmusfere When the heat
  of summer's over and the coolin' fall is here-- Of course we miss the
  flowers, and the blossums on the trees, And the mumble of the
  hummin'-birds and buzzin' of the bees; But the air's so appetizen';
  and the landscape through the haze Of a crisp and sunny morning of
  the airly autumn days Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin'
  to mock-- When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the
  shock.
  
  The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn, And the raspin'
  of the tangled leaves, as golden as the morn; The stubble in the
  furries--kindo' lonesome-like, but still A-preachin' sermons to us of
  the barns they growed to fill; The strawstack in the medder, and the
  reaper in the shed; The hosses in theyr stalls below--the clover
  overhead!-- O, it sets my hart a c-clickin' like the tickin' of a
  clock, When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock!
  
  Then your apples all is gethered, and the ones a feller keeps Is
  poured around the cellar-floor in red and yeller heaps; And your
  cider-makin' 's over, and your wimmern-folks is through With their
  mince and apple-butter, and theyr souse and saussage, too!... I don't
  know how to tell it--but ef sich a thing could be As the Angels
  wantin' boardin', and they'd call around on *me*-- I'd want to
  'commodate em--all the whole-indurin' flock-- When the frost is on
  the punkin and the fodder's in the shock!

      Title: WHICH RACK IS RIGHT?
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Information
 
  1.If your souffle come out lookinglike a crushed top hat, or your
  pizza crust turns out soggy, don't despair. The solution could be as
  simple as repositioning the racks in your oven. 2.Foods such as
  souffles, which rely on intense heat to bake and reach their maximum
  volume, bake best in the upper third of the oven. Set the oven rackon
  the second highest position to allow the souffle enough room to
  expand to its fullest height. 3.Other foods, such as pizza crusts,
  pies and slow cooking casseroles,fare better in the bottom third of
  the oven, with the oven rack set on the second lowest setting. 4.When
  baking two trays simultaneously, either of cookies, cakes or buns,be
  sure to bake one tray on the middle rack and the other tray on the
  next lowest rung. Baking two trays on the same level placed next to
  each other obstructs the heat flow and produces uneven or underbaked
  cookies. For best results, always switch rack postitions halfway
  through the baking time.

      Title: WHIPPED CREAM
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Fine granulated sugar (opt)
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Cream for whipping should be at least 1 day old.  It can be kept in
  the refrigerator in a sealed container for more than a week. Before
  being whipped it should be very cold. In hot weather the bowl and
  beater should also be chilled.
  
  Using a well chilled bowl, or setting the bowl over ice, beat cream
  with an electric mixer or rotary egg beater. As cream begins to
  thicken, beat in sugar and vanilla. Continue beating until stiff. If
  not to be served at once, place in refrigerator, where it may be kept
  2-3 hours.
  
  The Yield From A Cup of Cream Can Be Increased (with a very slight
  difference in texture) by adding 1 egg white to each cup of whipped
  and flavored cream.  Beat the egg white until it holds soft peaks.
  Sprinkle in 1 1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar.  Continue beating til
  very stiff. Fold into whipped cream.
  
  To Prepare Whipped Cream A Day or Two Ahead of Time: Soften 1/2
  teaspoon granulated gelatin (for each cup of cream to be whipped) in
  a small metal cup containing a tablespoon of cold water. Set cup in a
  pan of boiling water or over low heat, until gelatin dissolves and
  looks clear. Stirring is unneccessary. Beat dissolved gelatin into
  the cream just as cream begins to thicken.
  
  Gelatin will also give whipped cream extra firmness so it can be used
  for decorating with a pastry bag.
  
  Flavoring Whipped Cream To each cup of whipped cream, 1 of the
  following flavorings can be added: 2 tb sifted dark, unsweetened
  cocoa 2 4 tb rum, cognac, or any liquer 1/2 c nougat powder 1 ts
  instant coffee powder
  
  Fold flavorings into cream AFTER it has been whipped.

 Categories: Kids, Snacks
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 pt (2 cups) heavy cream
      2 tb Honey or sugar
     32    Squares (16 rectangles) of
           -graham crackers
           Sprinkles
 
  Beat cream with sweetener until stiff. Spread whipped cream heavily
  on one square and place it on a platter. Spread cream heavily on a
  second square and place it on top of the first. Continue until there
  is a stack of 4 squares. Press down gently on the top square so the
  cream squeezes out of the sides. Spread the excess along the sides.
  Repeat the procedure until there are eight stacks. Slide them
  together till sides touch to form a rectangular cake of 2 squares by
  4 squares. Use extra whipped cream to smooth over all the tops.
  Refrigerate. Allowing it to chill several hours before serving
  enables the crackers to soften. A dash of sprinkles over the top adds
  a party flavor with adding much additional sugar.
  
  Hint: Use a pressurized can of whipped cream if you don't have the
  time or inclination to whip the cream.

      Title: WHISKEY BALLS
 Categories: Desserts, Candies, Alcohol
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
      3 c  Vanilla wafer crumbs
    1/2 c  Finely chopped pecans
    1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa
      2 c  Confectioner's sugar
    1/2 c  Bourbon
      3 tb Light corn syrup
           Salt, if desired
 
  1.  Blend together the crumbs, nuts, cocoa, 1 cup confectioner's
      sugar, Bourbon, corn syrup, and a dash of salt. Form into small
      balls the size of walnuts.
  
  2.  Roll each ball in the remaining 1 cup confectioner's sugar and
      place on a cookie sheet.  Chill in the refrigerator for several
      hours or overnight.
  
  Note:  It is traditional in the South to use Bourbon, but rye may
         also be used. This confection -- or at least a version of it
  ~- was an early Southern version of those chocolate truffles that
  became the rage for chocolate lovers during the 1980s in this
  country. The whiskey balls are made, of course, with cocoa rather
  than chocolate.

           -lima
      6 c  Water
      3    Cloves garlic, chopped
      2 ts Salt
      4 c  Beef broth
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts Rosemary, crumbled
      2 c  Fresh green beans (about 3/4
           -lb), cut on the
           Diagonal in 1-inch pieces
      1 tb Butter
           Juice of 1/2 lemon
 
  Wash and pick over the dried beans.  Put them into a large saucepan or
  kettle with the water and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat,
  cover, and allow to stand for 1 hour.
  
  Return to the heat and bring to a boil again.  Reduce heat and simmer,
  partially covered, for 1/2 hour. Using a heavy fork, mash the garlic
  with the salt until no large chunks remain. Add to the saucepan with
  the beans. Add the broth, pepper, and rosemary.
  
  Simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender. This can take 15
  minutes or as long as 1 hour; timing for beans is hard to predict -
  keep checking.
  
  Soup can be made ahead to this point, and refrigerated or frozen after
  thorough cooling.
  
  Cook the green beans uncovered in 2 uarts of boiling salted water
  until they are tender-crisp and bright green. Drain and add to the
  soup when the white beans are tender but not mushy. If green beans
  are not to be added right away, rinse in cold water to retain color.
  Stir in the butter and lemon.  Serve at once, while green beans are
  still bright.
  
  Note:  If you want some of the soup pureed, do it before adding the
  green beans - the color will be better.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

 Categories: Candies, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Lb
 
 
        3 oz pkg. cream cheese
    2 1/2 c  sifted confectioners sugar
      1/2 ts almond extract
      1/2 c  chopped almonds
      1/8 ts salt
  
  Beat cream cheese until smooth & soft with electric mixer set at
  cream (or beat with a spoon).  Then slowly blend in remaining
  ingredients. Press into a buttered 9x5x3" loaf pan. Chill until firm,
  then cut in 21 pieces. Makes about 1 pound.
  
  Variation:  Coconut White Fudge - Substitute 1/2 c. flaked or cookie
  coconut for almonds.  Makes 21 pieces.
  
  I'm sure you could leave out the almonds and use vanilla instead of
  almond extract to make Vanilla Fudge, but I doubt it would turn out
  white. Walt MM

 Categories: Vegetables, German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb White asparagus
      2 qt Boiling water mixed with
      4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
    2/3 c  Fine,soft white bread crumbs
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  SNAP OFF THE WOODY ENDS of the asparagus and discard them or save
  them to make soup. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the asparagus
  spears. Lay them flat in a large skillet, pour in the boiling salted
  water, set the pan over moderate heat, cover it, and cook the
  asparagus for about 5 minutes, just until they are tender, but still
  crisp. Meanwhile, lightly brown the butter in a medium skillet over
  moderate heat. Add the bread crumbs and pepper and lightly toss them
  to mix. Reduce the heat under the skillet to low, to keep the crumbs
  warm. The instant the asparagus are done, drain them well, then
  return them to the skillet and shake them over moderate heat for 30
  seconds or so to dry up any excess moisture. Transfer the asparagus
  to a small heated platter, then artfully arrange the crumb mixture on
  top.

 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb White beans (like great
           Northerns)
      2 lg Onions, diced
      2 tb Ground cumin
      1 tb Chili powder
      1 ts Poultry seasoning
      2    To 4 oz cans diced green
           Chiles
      1    8 oz can salsa verde
           (optional)
      7 c  "chicken-like" or veggie
           Stock
      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 lb Tomatillos, cleaned &
           Quartered
      1 c  Fresh cilantro, coarsely
           Chopped
      1 ea Salt and pepper to taste
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
      1 c  Chopped green onions
      1 ea Optional - ff sour cream
 
  Soak beans overnight or use quick soak method (bring beans and water
  to cover by 1" to a boil for 5 min. Turn off heat and cover. Let sit
  1 hour, then proceed). Pour off soaking water and cover beans with
  fresh water and bring to full boil. Lower heat and simmer. While
  beans simmer, in a large soup kettle or dutch oven, saute onions
  using your favorite ff method (I use a little stock), when
  translucent, add cumin, chili pd, poultry seasoning, green chiles and
  salsa verde. Saute for 5 minutes, adding a little stock if it begins
  to stick. Then add the rest of the stock, bay leaves, tomatillos and
  3/4 c cilantro. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered while beans
  continue to cook. When beans are just tender (1-2 hours) add them to
  the soup pot and simmer everything together for another 1/2 hour.
  Season with salt and pepper to taste. Just before serving, add the
  rest of the cilantro and the lime juice, stir to blend. Ladle into
  big bowls and top with green onions and an optional dollop of ff sour
  cream.

      Title: WHITE BEAN CHILI WITH TURKEY
 Categories: Chili, Vegetables, Salads, Beans
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           -----chili-------
      1 lb Dried white beans
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      2 c  Chopped onions
      2    4 oz can diced green chilies
      6    Cl Garlic; minced
  1 1/2 tb Dried oregano; crushed
      1 tb Ground cumin
      1 tb Chili powder
      7 c  Chicken broth
     18 oz Fresh or canned tomatillos
           -chopped, about 3 1/2 cups
      1 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
  1 1/2 lb Boneless skinless turkey
           -breast, cut crosswise
           -in half
      1 c  Chopped green onions
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
           -----cilantro cream--------
    2/3 c  Plain yogurt
      3 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      3 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
           ------garnish------
           Fresh cilantro sprigs
    1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
 
    For chili: The recipe recommends soaking the beans overnight.
  Personally, I don't like to do that. I find the quick soak method
  works better. That is, cover beans with cold water. Bring to a boil
  and boil for 1-2 min. Turn off heat and let soak for 1 1/2 hours.
  Drain beans. Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy Dutch oven over
  medium heat. Add chopped onion and saute 5 minutes.  Add diced
  chilies, minced garlic, oregano, cumin, and chili powder. Saute for 5
  minutes. Add beans, chicken broth, chopped tomatillos and cilantro.
  It's important that the chicken broth contain little or no salt. Salt
  inhibits the softening of the seed coat of beans. Therefore, if you
  add salt too early the beans with never soften up. Add turkey breast
  and simmer until just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Transfer
  turkey to plate. Cover with foil and refrigerate. Simmer chili until
  beans are tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Cut turkey into 1/2 inch pieces.
  Add turkey, green onions and lime juice to chili. Stir. Heat through.
  Season with salt and pepper.
  
  For cilantro cream: Combine yogurt, parsley, chopped cilantro in a
  medium bowl.  Ladle chili into bowls. Top with spoonful of cilantro
  cream. Sprinkle with cilantro sprigs and cheese. Can be prepared 1
  day ahead. Cover chili and cilantro cream separately and refrigerate.
  Before serving, reheat chili over low heat. Like most chili, it
  tastes better the second day.  From Bon Appetit September 1992

      Title: WHITE BEANS WITH SAGE
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 cn Your favorite white
           Beans ..
      1    Bay leaf
      2    Fresh winter savory or thyme
           Sprigs
     10    Fresh sage leaves
      1 md Yellow onion, cut into 1/2
           Inch pieces
           Salt and pepper
      3    Garlic cloves, finely
           Chopped
    1/3 c  Dry white wine
    1/2 tb Parsley
 
  There have been a number of good polenta suggestions...here is one
  that we enjoyed earlier this summer. It was one of those hot days, so
  I chilled the polenta in a loaf pan, and just sliced it (without
  dry-frying or anything). On top I put white beans and sage. It's an
  adaptation of a recipe from Fields of Greens (called Warm Cannellini
  Beans with Sage, p. 270, for those of you with this cookbook)
  
  Put the beans into a saucepan with the bay leaf, savory and two of
  the sage leaves.  Warm gently until you need them, so that they take
  in the herb flavors. Remove the herbs and bay leaf, leave the beans
  in their broth.
  
  While the beans cook, chop the remaining sage leaves. Water-saute the
  onion, 1/2 t salt, and a few pinches of pepper. Saute (I'll probably
  use water next time; I tried wine, but I thought it made the whole
  thing to wine-y.) over medium heat until the onion begins to release
  its juices. Add the garlic and sage; saute for about 10 minutes, then
  add the wine and cook for a minute or two, until the pan is nearly
  dry.
  
  Add the beans and their broth to the onions along with 1/2 t salt and
  a few pinches of pepper.  Lower the heat and cook for 20 minutes,
  adding alittle water if needed to keep the beans saucy. Add salt and
  pepper to taste. Add the parsley just before serving.

      Title: WHITE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/4 c  :warm water (approx 105F)
      1 pk Dry yeast
  1 3/4 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter; softened OR
      2 tb Vegetable shortening or oil
      2 tb Sugar
  2 1/2 ts Salt
  5 1/2 c  All-purpose flour (or more)
 
  POUR THE WARM WATER over the yeast. Stir well, and let stand to
  dissolve. Heat the milk, stirring, to the same temperature as the
  yeast, then pour it over the dissolved yeast. Add the butter (or
  shortening or oil), sugar, salt and 4 cups of the flour. Beat
  vigorously with a large spoon for at least 1 minute. Stir in enough
  of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a stiff but not
  dry dough. Dust the kneading surface with 1/4 cup of the reserved
  flour and turn the dough out onto it, cleaning the bowl completely
  with a rubber spatula. Knead the dough for 1 minute, sprinkling extra
  flour a little at a time as necessary, then let rest for 10 minutes.
  Resume kneading for about 6 to 8 minutes more, or until the dough is
  smooth and elastic. Put in a lightly greased bowl, cover and let rest
  in a warm place to rise for between 1 and 2 hours. When the dough has
  doubled in bulk, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and punch
  it down for a minute. Cut dough in half and pat each half into an
  oval the approximate length of your bread pan, which should be
  lightly greased. Put in the pan, cover with a damp towel and let rise
  for another 45 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350F and, when
  the bread is risen, put it in the oven. Bake for about 40-to-45
  minutes in a glass pan, or 45-to-50 minutes in a metal pan. Makes 2
  Loaves

  *By Henry & Henry. Only available in Wholesale Bakery Supply in 5 gal
  pail. You might try substituting regular marshmallow creme. Does not
  contain gum------only difference. But one reason I use this is to
  make my buttercream roses crust harder. I can handle them better. We
  sell this in smaller quantities in our cake supply shop. Other
  reasons to use it: Makes icing softer & more "whipped creamy"
  tasting. ~Takes out a little of the sweet taste too. Add in order
  given: Crisco and flavors in a heavy duty mixer on low speed. Add
  milk or water and confectioners' sugar. Mix on medium speed until
  light and fluffy. Keep icing covered at all times. This recipe will
  cover one cake mix and do decorations. Keeps unrefrigerated for 2
  weeks in reasonably cool room. Keeps indefinately in fridge...Yes,
  made using milk too! Milk/Water- makes no difference in taste. But
  <purple> roses made using milk, don't fade to blue. ***Hand-held
  mixer: Don't add all the p.sugar so you won't burn up the mixer. When
  icing is nice & fluffy, THEN add the rest of the p.sugar...or enough
  to get it to spreadable consistency. If mixer gets hot <set a
  timer!>, turn it off for 20 minutes to cool it down or its ruined!
  Chocolate Icing: Add Hershey's Cocoa <no sub> until the buttercream
  icing becomes the nice rich chocolate color you want. If you want
  strong chocolate taste, you must add more cocoa. Butter: Of course
  icing made with butter tastes better. But it melts just setting out,
  so think what it does in the bag in your warm hands! Of course, you
  can substitute butter for Crisco <same amounts> or sub. half the
  Crisco, making it half Crisco & half butter. When butter icing is
  requested, I do it & just caution my customers that the decorations
  won't be as perfect. Usually they don't mind. Dolores McCann,

  keep at room temperature until needed.
  
  Place the heavy cream in a well-chilled bowl of an electric mixer
  fitted with a well-chilled balloon whip. Mix on high until stiff,

  combined whipped cream and white chocolate to the remaining whipped
  cream and use a rubber spatula to fold together until smooth.
  
  Transfer to a container and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before

 Categories: Chocolate, Godiva
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  Continued:
  
  Using a large knife, cut each of the squares in half diagonally to
  form 8 triangles. Using a small knife, carefully slice each triangle
  in half crosswise to form two thin layers from each triangle. There
  will be a total of 16 triangles. You will need 12 triangles for this
  recipe. The extra are in case of breakage.
  
  Make the dark mocha sauce: Melt the chocolate with the coffee
  according to the directions in the Chocolate Key. In a small saucepan
  bring the cream to a gentle boil. Gradually whisk the cream into the
  melted chocolate until smooth. Stir in the vanilla and coffee
  liqueur. The sauce may be made up to 5 days in advance and
  refrigerated, covered, until serving. Reheat the sauce over simmering
  water before serving.
  
  Make the creme anglaise: In a heavy, medium non-corrosive saucepan,
  bring the milk, cream and vanilla bean to a gentle boil over medium
  low heat. Cover the pan, remove it from the heat and let the
  mixturestand for 15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean pieces. Using a
  small, sharp knife, scrape the tiny black seeds from the inside of
  the vanilla bean into the milk mixture.
  
  In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until blended.
  Gradually whisk the warm milk mixture into the yolk mixture until
  blended. Return this mixture back to the saucepan. Continue cooking
  over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon for 2 to
        4    minutes, or until the custard has thickened slightly. It
  is done when you can run your finger down the back of the
  custard-coated spoon and a path remains in the custard for several
  seconds. Do not let the custard come to a boil.
  
  Remove the pan from the heat and immediately strain the custard into a
  noncorrosive metal bowl. Place the bowl in a larger bowl of iced
  water and stir the custard for 10 to 15 minutes, or until cold. (The
  creme anglaise sauce may be prepared up to two days in advance,
  cooled, covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated. ) Assemble the
  napoleons: Remove the white chocolate and mocha mascarpone creams
  from the refrigerator. In their separate bowls, whisk each of the
  creams to soft peaks.
  
  In a large chilled bowl, combine the remaining 3/4 cup heavy cream
  from the white chocolate mascarpone cream with the remaining 3/4 cup
  heavy cream from the mocha mascarpone cream. Using a handheld
  electric mixer, beat the cream at medium-high speed to soft peaks. Do
  not overbeat. Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold one-half of
  the whipped cream (about 1 1/2 Cups) into the white chocolate
  mascarpone cream. Fold the remaining whipped cream into the mocha
  mascarpone cream.
  
  Fill two pastry bags fitted with medium star tips (such as Ateco #5)
  with each of the creams. Place a puff pastry triangle on a work
  surface. Dust the triangle with confectioners' sugar. Pipe a layer of
  mocha mascarpone cream onto the triangle. Top with another puff
  triangle. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Pipe a layerof white
  chocolate mascarpone cream over the second triangle. Garnish the
  napoleon with a chocolate-covered espresso bean. Repeat this layering
  process with the remaining puff pastry triangles to form a total of
  six napoleons.
  
  Spoon some dark mocha sauce on a dessert plate. Fill a squeeze bottle
  with creme anglaise sauce. Pipe a spiral of creme anglaise over the
  mocha sauce. Draw a toothpick from the center of the plate to the
  edge, all around the plate at 1-inch intervals. Place a napoleon in
  the center of the plate. Dust with cocoa powder, if desired. Serve
  immediately.

      5 tb SESAME SEEDS
      1 ts GROUND GINGER
     12 tb UNSALTED BUTTER -- CUT INTO
           GRAND MARNIER
 
  3/4  cup           GRANULATED SUGAR
        1    cup           HONEY WHITE CHOCOLATE BLACK -- PEPPER
  MOUSSE: 7 ounces        WHITE CHOC COARSELY CHOPPED
    1 1/4    cups          HEAVY CREAM 5 tablespoons WATER -- DIVIDED 1
  1/2 teaspoons     UNFLAVORED POWDERED GELATIN
        4    large         EGG YOLKS
        2    tablespoons   ORANGE LIQUEUR 1 teaspoon FRESHLY GROUND
  BLACK PEPPER 1/2 teaspoon GRANULATED SUGAR
  
  Make the apricot compote: In a medium saucepan, combine the apricots,
  water, sugar and orange liqueur. Cook the mixture over medium heat,
  stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves . Bring the mixture
  to a boil; reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the mixture for 5
  minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool for 15
  minutes. Remove 12 whole apricots from the compote and set them aside
  for garnish. Pour the remaining compote into the bowl of a food
  processor fitted with the metal blade. Process the mixture for 30 to
  45 seconds, until smooth. Transfer the purie to a small bowl, cover
  and refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  Make the ginger-sesame tuiles: In a small bowl place the flour, sesame
  seeds and ginger. Using a whisk, gently stir the dry mixture until
  combined.
  
  In a medium saucepan combine the butter, sugar and honey. Cook the
  mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter is
  melted, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a 4 l/2-quart bowl
  of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. At
  low speed, gradually add the dry flour mixture to the butter-honey
  mixture. Scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
  Continue to mix the batter at low speed until just warm, about 5
  minutes. Cover the bowl and allow the batter to sit at room
  temperature for 2 hours.
  
  Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 F. Spray
  a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Drop two 1 teaspoon-size
  balls of the batter onto the sheet, 6 inches apart (begin by baking
  only 2 tuiles at a time, to get an idea of how they will spread in
  your oven). Bake the tuiles for 4 to 6 minutes, until golden brown.
  Allow the tuiles to cool for 3 to 5 minutes on the baking sheet, then
  carefully transfer them with a spatula to a wire rackto cool
  completely. Continue this baking process, respraying the baking sheet
  as necessary, until all the batter is used.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  Continued:
  
  Make the white chocolate black pepper mousse: Melt the white chocolate
  according to the directions in the Chocolate Key. Set aside to cool.
  
  In a chilled 4 l/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using
  the wire whip attachment, whip the cream until it just begins to
  mound. Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.
  
  Place 3 tablespoons of the cold water in a small, heatproof cup.
  Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let it stand for 5 minutes to
  soften. Place the cup with the softened gelatin in a saucepan with
  enough water to come halfway up the side of the cup. Heat the gelatin
  mixture over hot, not simmering, water. Stir the gelatin frequently
  until it dissolves completely and the mixture is clear, about 3 to 4
  minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.
  
  In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, place the egg
  yolks, orange liqueur, the remaining 2 tablespoons of water, the
  black pepper and the sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of hot water.
  The bottom of the bowl must touch the water. Cook over medium heat,
  whisking constantly for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the yolk mixture is
  light and fluffy and has reached 140 F. on an instant-read
  thermometer. Place the bowl on the mixer stand and, with the wire
  whip attachment in place, beat the mixture at medium-high speed until
  it is thick and cool, about 5 minutes.
  
  At low speed, beat in the dissolved gelatin mixture just until
  combined. Using a large rubber spatula, fold the cooled white
  chocolate into the mixture. Fold one-third of the whipped cream into
  the mixture to lighten it. Fold in the remaining whipped cream. Cover
  the mousse with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes, or until
  firm enough to pipe.
  
  Assemble the dessert: Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip
  (such as Ateco #5) with the mousse. Place a ginger-sesame tuile on a
  dessert plate. Pipe some of the mousse onto the tuile. Top with a
  second tuile. Repeat the layering process, until you have used 4
  tuiles. Sprinkle the top tuile with confectioners' sugar. Place 3 of
  the reserved apricots around the dessert and drizzle with apricot
  purie as desired. Repeat with the remaining tuiles and mousse to make
        4    servings.

  1. Preheat oven to 350-F. Form a sheet of tinfoil over the back of a
  9 inch square baking pan. Place the foil in the pan and smooth it
  into corners and sides as evenly as possible.
  
  2. Place the hazelnuts in a roasting pan. Put them in oven and roast
  for 10 minutes, then place nuts in a heavy kitchen towel and rub them
  back and forth vigorously, so that their bitter dried skins are
  removed. Pick over and discard all skins. Grind the nuts coarsely or
  chop in a food processor.
  
  3. Melt the dark chocolate and butter over hot water. Stir in sugar,
  brandy, and nuts, and mix well. Form paste into 25 small balls.
  
  4. Arrange the chocolate balls in 5 even rows over the bottom of the
  dish, and press each ball down so that it is somewhat flattened
  against the bottom of the pan.
  
  5. Place the grated white chocolate over hot water and let it melt
  completely. Stir until smooth, then immediately pour the chocolate
  into the center of the pan and over as many chocolate rounds as
  possible. Using a finger, smooth the chocolate evenly over the balls,
  out to the edge of the pan in a thin, flat layer.
  
  6. Place the pan in refrigerator briefly, until the chocolate hardens
  somewhat but does not completely firm. Run a knife or ravioli cutter
  between the rows and down the sides, then replace dish in the
  refrigerator to harden. When firm, lift out the foil and separate the
  candies into individual pieces.

 Categories: Cakes, Snacks, Desserts, Microwave
      Yield: 14 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Macadamia nuts
      1 c  Flour; plus 2 tbsp.
    3/4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Water
      9 oz White chocolate
      2 lg Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Recipe by: the California Culinary Academy Preparation Time: 0:50 1.
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. If macadamia nuts are salted, blanch in
  boiling water to cover for 30 seconds to remove salt. Rinse under cold
  running water and transfer to a baking sheet. Toast in a 325 degrees
  F oven until golden brown. Let cool, then coarsely chop. If nuts are
  unsalted, just toast and chop.
  
  2. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
  
  3. Place butter, sugar, and water in a medium saucepan over low heat.
  Cut 6 ounces of the white chocolate into large (1- or 2-inch) chunks
  and the remaining 3 ounces into small (1/4-inch to 1/2-inch) chips.
  
  4. When butter has melted, remove from heat, add the 6 ounces white
  chocolate chunks and stir until chocolate melts.
  
  5. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture until just
  blended. Stir in the 3 ounces of white chocolate chips and the nuts.
  
  6. Spread batter in a greased 8- or 9-inch square baking pan. Bake 30
  to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out
  clean. Cool on a wire rack, then cut into squares.
  
  * Timesaver Tip: Brownie batter can be made ahead and frozen before
  baking. Line an 8- or 9-inch square pan with heavy-duty foil. Spoon
  batter into pan. Freeze batter, uncovered, until frozen solid. Remove
  from pan and wrap tightly. Label and date package. Freeze at 0
  degrees F up to 4 weeks. To bake, peel foil from batter and place in
  greased pan. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven until skewer
  inserted in center comes out clean (40 to 50 minutes).
  
  Microwave Version: Chocolate may be melted in a microwave oven. Place
  butter and chocolate in a small glass bowl. Microwave on 50% power
  for 1 minute, stir, then continue microwaving 1 to 3 minutes more.
  Stir until smooth. Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch around
  edges and won't blend smoothly. Stir in sugar and water and continue
  with step 5.

 Categories: Cheesecake, Chocolate, Alcohol
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           <--Cheesecake-->
      1    1/2 c. sugar (up to 1)
  1 1/2 lb (3 pkgs) softened cream
           -cheese
      3    Eggs
      8    9 oz. good quality white
           -chocolate
      3 tb Heavy cream
      1 c  Sour cream
    1/4 c  Amaretto
           <--Topping-->
      1 c  Sour cream
      1 c  Confectioner's sugar
 
  Use butter cookie or brown sugar cookie dough to make a crust. Or
  make a cookie crumb crust.
  
  Cheesecake: Beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar.
  Beat in eggs one at a time. Melt white chocolate with heavy cream (in
  double boiler or in microwave, but if using microwave, stop and stir
  every 20 seconds). Beat white chocolate, Amaretto, and sour cream
  into batter. Beat a while longer. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven
  55-60 minutes. If top starts to become too brown, cover w/ foil
  part-way through baking. Or refrigerate cake and just slice top off
  cheesecake when cool.
  
  Topping: Whisk together. Add a touch of Amaretto or vanilla. Spoon
  over top of cake, letting some drip over the sides.
  
  Serve w/ fresh fruit, if desired.
  
  Notes: (1) You'll probably want less than 1 1/2 cups of sugar since
  the white chocolate & the Amaretto are both sweet. Add 1 cup, taste
  batter, then add more if needed. (2) Suggested chocolates: Tobler
  Narcisse, Lindt, Valhrona white chocolate couverture, Callebaut, etc.)

           Paraffin)
           Cotton candy
           Candy Dinosaurs
 
  Melt chocolate over medium heat in double boiler until evenly smooth.
  Lightly coat each inside egg mold half with nonstick spray. Pour in
  about 1/2 cup melted chocolate in 1/2 mold and "roll" mold around
  gently so gravity makes the chocolate flow over entire inside
  surface. Pour in more to thicken out any thin spots if necessary.
  Repeat with other half. Refrigerate 10-15 minutes. Save 2-3
  tablespoons of chocolate to seal egg. Dip each outer half in warm
  water to loosen egg shell and invert it on a plate. Repeat with other
  half. If you crack or break the shell, remelt and try again.
  
  Place cotton candy nest in bottom half of egg, place candy Dinosaur
  into cotton candy nest and cover with top half of shell. Seal the
  seam with remaining melted chocolate, and smooth with your finger.
  
  Your Dinosaur egg is now ready to present. Hatch the egg by rapping
  the top shell with the back of a spoon to reveal the candy Baby
  Dinosaur inside.

    1/4 l  Whipping cream
      2    Sheets of gelatine
      1 tb White rum

  it 'au bain marie'(*) and stir occasionally until chocolate has
  melted. Even better: put the bowl in the microwave, heat for 2 times
  2 minutes on low and stir well. Make sure the chocolate doesn't get
  too hot, because it will get lumpy (gritty) and useless. Let the
  melted chocolate cool down to room temperature, by putting it in a
  larger bowl with cold water.
  
  Put egg & sugar in a large bowl. Mix with an electric mixer until
  white and creamy (about 8 minutes).
  
  Soak the gelatine leaves in lots of cold water for about 5 minutes or
  until soft.
  
  Heat two tablespoons of water in a bowl / small pan until cooking.
  Remove from heat and solve the wrung-out gelatine in it. Let it cool
  a little.
  
  Put the rum, the melted chocolate and the solved gelatine into the
  bowl with the egg mixture. Fold together carefully with a large spoon
  (or two).
  
  Put the mixture in the fridge and let it set just a little or until
  you finished the next task...being:
  
  Whip the cream until stiff.
  
  Carefully fold the cream into the rest of the pudding. Put it in small
  bowls or one large bowl.
  
  Serve with chocolate sauce (i just buy a bottle).

      Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING WITH WHITE CHOC
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Roll, 10" long and 2 1/2"
           In diameter or the equi-
           Valent amount of bread
      2 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Sugar
      9 oz White chocolate, chopped
      1    Egg
      4    Egg yolks
           Semi-sweet chocolate for
           Garnish (optional)
 
  Cut the roll into eight slices; place on middle rack of a 250F oven
  and leave until dry, about 20 minutes. In a saucepan, heat 1 1/2 cups
  of the heavy cream, the milk, and the sugar over low heat, stirring
  until sugar is dissolved.  Add 5 oz. of the white chocolate, stir
  until melted, and remove from the heat.  In a large bowl, whisk the
  egg and yolks together. Whisk the chocolate mixture into the eggs a
  little at a time. Tear the bread into 1" pieces, add to the white
  chocolate custard, and stir to mix. Leave to soak, stirring
  occasionally, until all the custard has been absorbed by the bread, 1
  to 2 hours.  Put the mixture into an 8" square, 2" deep baking dish.
  Put the dish in a slightly large pan and add hot water to come
  halfway up the sides of the baking dish.  Bake the pudding in the
  water bath at 350F for 45-50 minutes, until the custard is set and
  the top is golden brown. Serve warm or cold. If you chill it, loosen
  the sides with a metal spatula and invert the pudding onto a cutting
  surface. Cut into four squares and cut each square into a triangle.
  For the sauce, heat the remaining cream in a small pan.  Add the
  remaining 4 oz. white chocolate and melt.  If desired, grate some
  semi-sweet chocolate and sprinkle on top of the pudding.

      Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE #3
 Categories: Cakes, Cheesecake, Chocolate
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     12 oz White chocolate
      2 c  Pound cake crumbs
  1 1/2 lb Cream cheese, softened
      1 c  Sugar
  2 1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 tb Apricot brandy
      2 c  Sour cream
 
  Melt white chocolate over low heat in a double boiler.
   Set aside to cool slightly.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Distribute
  pound cake crumbs evenly over the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
  Press crumbs down lightly. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together
  cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and apricot brandy with an electric
  mixer for at least five minutes or until very smooth.  Add melted
  white chocolate and blend another five minutes. Add sour cream and
  mix to combine. Pour into crumb lined pan and bake at 350 degrees for
  30 minutes. Chill overnight before serving. This cheesecake freezes
  very well, and makes about 12-14 slices. It goes well with commercial
  fruit sauces or fresh fruit but it is so delicious that it really
  doesn't need anything else! It does look nice when it is garnished
  with fresh raspberries and mint sprigs though.  This one has been
  described as "to die for"!!! From: Karen Henson/Prodigy

  This pull-out-all-stops dessert layers a white chocolate pistachio
  cake with strawberries and a do-ahead pistachio butter-cream. For the
  finishing touches, whipped cream is piped up the sides, and a
  marzipan top is crowned with fresh strawberries.
  
  To make cake: Preheat oven to 350F. Butter and flour two
  9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high-sides. Bring half and
  half to simmer in small saucepan. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and
  vanilla and stir until smooth; cool to room temperature. Finely grind
  pistachios with flour and baking powder in processor. Using electric
  mixer, beat butter and 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Add
  yolks 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in flour
  mixture alternately with white chocolate mixture in 2 additions each.
  Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft
  peaks form. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating until
  stiff but not dry. Fold whites into batter in 2 additions. Divide
  batter between prepared pans. Bake cakes until tester inserted into
  center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool 10 minutes. Cut around
  pan sides to loosen cakes. Turn out cakes onto racks; cool
  completely. Hull and slice 2 baskets strawberries. Place 1 cake layer
  on platter. Spread 1 cup buttercream over. Arrange enough berry
  slices over to cover. Spread 1 cup buttercream over. Arrange another
  layer of sliced berries over to cover. Spread thin layer of
  buttercream over second cake layer and place cake, buttercream side
  down, atop berries. Press gently to adhere. Spread remaining
  buttercream over top and sides of cake. Chill cake until buttercream
  is firm, about 1 hour. Knead marzipan in medium bowl to soften. Shape
  marzipan into disk. Dust work surface with 2 tablespoons powdered
  sugar. Roll out marzipan disk on powdered sugar to 9 1/2-round. Place
  on cake; press to adhere to top and gently press overhang onto sides
  of cake. Beat whipping cream and remaining 1/4 cup powdered sugar in
  large bowl to firm peaks. Transfer to large pastry bag fitted with
  medium star tip. Pipe cream in side-by-side columns up sides of cake.
  Pipe border of rosettes around top edge of cake. Refrigerate cake
  until cold, at least 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover
  with cake dome and keep refrigerated. Let stand at room temperature
  30 minutes before continuing.) Arrange remaining whole strawberries
  in center of cake.
  
  To make frosting: Bring half and half and pistachios to boil in heavy
  small saucepan. Remove from heat; cover and let stand 1 hour. Whisk
  sugar, yolks and flour in medium bowl to blend. Bring half and half
  mixture to simmer; gradually whisk into yolk mixture. Return to same
  saucepan; stir over medium heat until mixture bubbles thickly, about
  5 minutes. Mix in vanilla. Transfer to processor; blend until nuts
  are very finely chopped. Transfer pistachio pastry cream to bowl.
  Cover and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Using electric
  mixer, beat unsalted butter in large bowl until fluffy. Add pastry
  cream by 1/4 cupfuls, beating well after each addition. (Can be
  prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room
  temperature before using.)

      Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE LASAGNA WITH PEANUT ICE CREAM
 Categories: Chocolate, Desserts, Ice cream
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Half & half
      8    Egg yolks
  1 3/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Smooth peanut butter
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 c  Unsalted dry-roasted
           -peanuts, coarsely chopped
           -(about 5 oz)
      3 oz Bars white chocolate, broken
           -in half widthwise
     16 oz Bittersweet chocolate
      8 oz Unsalted butter
      1 c  Evaporated milk
 
  Servings:  4
  
  Mint sprigs for garnish
  
  In medium saucepan, scald the half & half over medium heat, set
  aside. In medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 3/4 cup sugar, a
  pinch of salt, and 1 tsp of the vanilla. Gradually whisk in the half
  & half and transfer to the saucepan.  Cook this mixture over moderate
  heat, stirring constantly, until just thick enough to coat the back
  of a spoon (165 on a candy thermometer). This will take 10-15
  minutes. DO NOT bring to a boil or you'll have a curdled mess on your
  hands. Remove from heat and whisk in the peanut butter, then add the
  cream. Strain this custard into a bowl and refrigerate, stirring
  occasionally, until well chilled. In the meantime, line a 10-by-15
  inch jelly roll pan with wax paper. Transfer custard to a Donvier or
  other ice cream freezer and freeze until thickened but still
  pourable.  Add peanuts.  Pour mixture into the jelly roll pan, spread
  evenly, cover, and freeze overnight.
  
  Prepare sugar syrup by mixing the remaining 1 cup of sugar with 1 cup
  of water.  Bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar, then remove from
  heat and set aside 'til later.
  
  Preheat oven on lowest setting for 5 minutes, then turn it off. Place
  the 6 pieces of white chocolate on a large baking sheet lined with
  wax paper. Place in the warm oven until soft enough to yield when
  pressed by a finger, about 6 minutes.  Using a metal spatula,
  transfer a piece of softened chocolate to an individual piece of wax
  paper (at least 12 inches long) and cover with a second sheet of
  paper.  Using a large heavy rolling pin, gently roll the chocolate
  between the paper to form a thin sheet of chocolate, about 11 by 4
  inches. Set each sheet of chocolate aside while you repeat this with
  the rest of the chocolate. Line 3 baking sheets with wax paper.  When
  the white chocolate is cooled and firm, remove the top piece of paper
  from each chocolate sheet. Using a pizza wheel or long sharp knife,
  trim the edges of each sheet to make a neat 3-by-10-inch rectangle,
  then cut each rectangle crosswise to form two 3-by-5-inch pieces.
  Transfer 4 rectangles to each of the prepared baking sheets. Keep
  cool.
  
  In a double boiler, melt the bittersweet chocolate with the butter,
  stirring until smooth.  Transfer to a bowl. Whisk in 1 cup of the
  reserved sugar syrup. Stir in the evaporated milk and 1 tsp. vanilla.
  Set aside, covered.  Note:  this sauce can be made up to 1 week in
  advance and kept, covered, in the fridge.
  
  With a pizza cutter or thin sharp knife, cut the ice cream into ten 3
  by-5-inch rectangles.  There will be a little left over; do what you
  will with it. ;-) With a spatula, place a piece of the ice cream on
  each of the 4 pieces of white chocolate.  Top each with another piece
  of chocolate, then another layer of ice cream, then another piece of
  chocolate. Freeze for 3 to 4 hours.
  
  To serve, remove the assembled lasagnas from the freezer and allow to
  soften slightly at room temperature for a few minutes. Gently reheat
  the fudge sauce in the top of a double boiler or in the microwave.
  Place each of the portions to serving plates, spoon fudge sauce over,
  garnish with mint, and serve immediately.

  * I buy large good quality candy bars, such as Lindt, and chop them
  up. ** I use straight from the jar, you may prefer to chop up
  
  Preheat oven to 375 F Mix all dry ingredients together in a separate
  bowl In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until fluffy. Add
  vanilla and egg--mix well. Slowly add dry ingredients to butter/sugar
  mixture--mix well Add chocolate and nuts Spoon onto lightly greased
  cookie sheets (I use cushionaire--no burning) Make whatever size you
  what--I tend to make them large because it saves time Bake 8-12
  minutes, depending on size of cookies--they should not brown, more of
  a golden color Cool on rack
  
  BTW:  I usually make a double batch of the dough, separate into
  halves, and add regular chocolate chunks and pecans to one (and maybe
  some coconut), white chocolate and macadamias to the other--two
  cookies with half the work

      Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE MINT TRUFFLES
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 45 Servings
 
    1/2 lb White chocolate; cut into
           -small pieces
    1/2 c  Packed, fresh mint leaves
           -(green or white)
    1/4 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Creme de menthe
      6 tb Unsalted butter; cut into
           -small pieces
 
  To make the truffles: Melt the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl
  set over gently simmering water. When chocolate is almost melted,
  turn off the heat and let stand until completely melted, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, steep mint leaves in cream and creme
  de menthe until liquid is very flavorful (amount of time depends upon
  the strength of the mint leaves). Then bring just to a simmer,
  strain, pressing down on the mint leaves to give as much flavor as
  possible, and whisk into the melted chocolate. Place the pieces of
  butter around the warm mixture and let the butter melt. When melted,
  stir to mix well. Pour mixture into a shallow pan, giving you a
  1-inch-thick layer of chocolate. Cool completely and then refrigerate
  or freeze until very firm.
  
  To form the truffles: Have a small bowl of very hot water ready and
  replace the water as it cools down. Line a baking tray with parchment
  paper. Remove truffle base from the refrigerator or freezer. Before
  scooping out a ball of chocolate, dip the melon baller into the hot
  water, shaking to remove any excess water. Scoop out a truffle,
  tapping the melon baller on a firm surface to release the truffle.
  Quickly roll between the palms of your hands and place on the
  prepared baking tray. You will have to wash your hands in cold water
  often to prevent the chocolate from sticking to your hands. Repeat
  this procedure until all the balls have been scooped and rolled. If
  the truffle base begins to soften too much, refrigerate or freeze
  until firm and then continue to scoop out the truffles. Refrigerate
  or freeze until needed. Makes 45 to 50 small truffles.

      Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE-CHEF APUZZO OF ANDREA'
 Categories: Puddings, Desserts
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
     16 oz White chocolate
      1 c  Heavy whipping cream
      3    Eggs, separated
    1/4 c  Brandy
    1/4 c  Hot water
      1 tb Vanilla
      2 oz Sugar
 
  White chocolate is not actually chocolate at all, but cocoa butter
  with the chocolate liquor left out. This dessert was originally
  concieved as a dark chocolate mousse by Chef Andrea Apuzzo of
  Andrea's Restaurant in Metairie, Louisiana, when he was executive
  chef at the Royal Orleans Hotel before opening Andrea's. It is served
  piped into a chocolate cup, which is then placed in a pool of
  raspberry sauce.
  
  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat. It's a good idea
  to stand over the chocolate while it is melting and stir it until it's
  completely melted, then take it off the heat immediately.
  
  Whip the cream and set aside. Pour the brandy and hot water slowly
  into a bowl with the egg yolks, whisking briskly as you go until
  completely mixed.
  
  Whisk in the melted chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is
  completely combined; this will help to cool the chocolate. Whip the
  egg whites and the sugar until peaking but not dry; add the vanilla
  to the egg whites and sugar as you beat them.
  
  Fold the egg-white meringue into the chocolate mixture carefully with
  a wooden spoon.
  
  Fold in the whipped cream. THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF THE
  RECIPE. The key to a great chocolate mousse is that you can't
  incorporate hot melted chocolate into whipped cream. The chocolate
  mixture must be cool to the touch or the cream will break. Lightly
  blend the two mixtures until uniform.  Walt MM

  ~---------------------------------------------MOUSSE: Melt chocolate
  in the microwave until melted. Stir---> until smooth. Using a small
  pastry brush; brush chocolate on the entire inside surface of the
  fluted cup; being certain to get into each pleat.  Opt for a second
  or third coat of chocolate if you aren't sure you got all places
  covered. Put in the freezer to harden. Remove the cups, 1 at a time
  and very carefully peel off the foil, trying to handle as gently as
  possible. If the chocolate breaks and the foil is still intact, just
  brush some more chocolate over the break and return to the freezer to
  harden.
   This sounds a lot more difficult than it actually is. Keep cups in
  the freezer until you fill them with the---> mousse. WHITE CHOCOLATE
  MOUSSE Again use Tobler Narcisse, Droste White or any other fine
  brand of imported white chocolate. Melt chocolate in top of double
  boiler. When melted, add warmed cream and stir until mix is smooth.
  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Beat egg whites until
  ~--> stiff peaks form. Mix 1/3 of the whites into the cooled
  chocolate to lighten and then fold in the remaining whites. Fold the
  whipped cream into the egg white mixture and chill in the
  refrigerator until set. Gently spoon the mousse into the chocolate
  cups, garnish with chocolate curls or grated dark chocolate.

  Posting the recipe for that disgustingly rich chocolate pound cake the
  other day reminded me of another favorite cake around our house. This
  White Chocolate Pound Cake is a lot lighter than the other, and is
  delicious with fresh strawberries or raspberries. I've even been
  known to sneak a piece of this cake for breakfast (when the kids
  aren't looking). The recipe comes from the "White Chocolate Cookbook"
  by Janice Henderson. There's lots more where this came from if you
  want them.
  
  White Chocolate Pound Cake
  
  Position a rack in the center and preheat oven to 300 deg F. Butter a
  10 inch fluted tube pan.  Dust with flour; tap out the excess.
  Sprinkle the pecans over the bottom.
  
  Using an electric mixer set at medium speed, beat the butter in a
  large bowl until light and fluffy, then add the sugar, 1 cup at a
  time, beating well after each addition.
  
  Blend in the cream and white chocolate.  Add the eggs, one at a time,
  beating well after each addition.  Into a large bowl, sift the flour
  with the salt and baking soda. Mix the flour mixture into the cream
  mixture, 1 cup at a time, just until blended.
  
  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a cake tester
  inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and
  15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes. Transfer the cake in the pan to
  a wire rack and cool 15 minutes.  Loosen the cake from the edges of
  the pan with a metal spatula and invert onto the wire rack. Cool
  completely. Through a fine-mesh sieve, sprinkle confectioners' sugar
  over the top of the cake. store at room temperature, wrapped airtight.
  
  One note on melting white chocolate:  Since the fats in white
  chocolates melt at different temperatures, and since the milk
  proteins tend to clump if overheated, melting white chocolate can be
  very frustrating. I've found that the easiest method is to chop the
  chocolate into small pieces and melt them in the microwave. Microwave
  at high power for 1 minute, then stir. If necessary, continue the
  process for additional 30-second intervals until completely melted.
  Microwave only until smooth; DO NOT OVERHEAT!!!
  
  Whatever you do, don't take this cake to work with you. I did that
  once and have not had a moment's peace since. B-)

           -chocolate
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter, at room
           -temperature

      1 c  Plus 2 tbsp flour, sifted
 
  FROM:      DEREK MADDOX
  
  One of our family's favorite cookies is shortbread. It's easy to
  make, and VERY easy to eat.  This recipe also includes white
  chocolate -- what more could you ask for. I was going to make this
  shortbread tonight, but discovered that someone has eaten all my
  white chocolate! I haven't determined the culprit yet, but my 7-year
  old son is my number one suspect!
  
  1. Preheat oven to 400 deg F.  Lightly butter a 9-inch pie pan (or
  your favorite shortbread mold).  Using a food processor fitted with a
  metal blade, chop the white chocolate using on-off pulses, until it
  resembles coarse meal.
  
  2. Using an electric mixer set at medium speed, cream the butter with
  the sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the flour. Stir in
  the chopped white chocolate.
  
  3. Pat the dough evenly into the prepared pan. Using the tip of a
  sharp knife, score the dough into eight equal triangles.
  
  4. Bake the shortbread until light golden in color, about 30 minutes.
  Transfer in the pan to a wire rack to cool slightly. Remove the
  shortbread from the pan and cool completely on the wire rack. Store
  in an airtight container at room temperature.

  FRAMBOISE LIQUEUR 1/2 pt FRESH RASPBERRIES 1/4 c SEEDLESS RASPBERRY
  JAM WHITE CHOCOLATE CURLS: 8 oz CHUNK WHITE CHOCOLATE, -ABOUT
  3/4-INCH THICK RASPBERRY SAUCE: 3 c UNSWEETENED FROZEN RASP -BERRIES
  1/2 c GRANULATED SUGAR Make the sponge cake: Position a rack in the
  center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-by-18 inch
  jelly roll pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the
  short ends of the pan. Butter the aluminum foil and the sides of the
  pan. Lightly dust thebottom of the pan with flour and tap out the
  excess.
  
  In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the paddle
  attachment, beat the butter at medium-high speed 1 minute, until
  smooth. While continuing to beat, add 1 cup of the sugar in a steady
  stream. Beat 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture is light and creamy.
  Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, stopping to scrape down the side
  of the bowl if necessary. Beat in the vanilla andlemon rind, and
  continue to beat for 2 minutes.
  
  Sift the flour and baking powder together onto a piece of waxed
  paper. Set aside.
  
  In a grease-free 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer,
  using the wire whip attachment, beat the egg whites with the salt at
  low speed until frothy. Gradually increase the speed to medium-high
  and continue beating the whites until they start to form soft peaks.
  One teaspoon at a time, gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar
  and continue to beat the whites until they form stiff, shiny peaks.
  
  Beating at low speed, alternately add the flour mixture and milk to
  the yolk mixture. Continue to beat at low speed for 1 minute. Using a
  balloon whisk or large rubber spatula, fold the beaten whites into
  the egg yolk mixture one-third at a time. Scrape the batter into the
  prepared pan and spread it into a thin, even layer with an offset
  metal cake spatula.
  
  Bake the sponge cake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the center springs
  back when gently pressed with a finger. Transfer the pan to a wire
  rack and cool for 10 minutes. Using the foil edges as handles, lift
  the cake from the pan and set it on a wire rack to cool completely.
  
  Make the ring molds: Cut eight 9 1/2-by-2 1/2-inch strips out of stiff
  paper (unused manila folders work well). Bring the short ends of each
  strip together, overlapping by 1/2 inch, and tape the outside seams
  with masking tape. The ring molds should be approximately 2 3/4
  inches in diameter.
  
  Line the molds: Using a 2 3/4-inch round cookie cutter or one of the
  prepared ring molds, cut out 8 rounds of the sponge cake. Reserve the
  remaining sponge cake for garnish. Line a baking sheet with aluminum
  foil and place the cake rounds on it. Moisten each cake round with
  some of the Framboise liqueur. Place one ring mold over each cake
  round, so that the mold touches the bottom of the baking sheet.
  
  Make the white chocolate veloute: Melt the white chocolate according
  to the directions in the Chocolate Key. Set aside to cool.
  
  In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using
  the wire whip attachment, whip the cream until it just begins to
  mound. Set aside in the refrigerator.

      Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE VELOUTES 2
 Categories: Chocolate, Godiva
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  Part 2........
  
  In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the wire
  whip attachment, beat the eggs and the salt at medium-high speed
  until frothy. Add the sugar in a steady stream and beat just until
  blended. Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and place over a pot of
  hot water. (The bottom of the bowl must touch the water. ) Cook over
  medium-high heat, whisking constantly for 3 to 5 minutes, or until
  the granules of sugar have dissolved and the egg mixture has reached
  140 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Return the bowl to the
  mixer stand and beat at medium-high speed until the mixture is thick
  and pale yellow, about 8 minutes.
  
  Place the cold water in a small, heatproof cup. Sprinkle the gelatin
  over the water and let it stand for 5 minutes to soften the gelatin.
  Place the cup with the softened gelatin in a saucepan with enough
  water to come halfway up the side of the cup. Heat the gelatin
  mixture over hot, not simmering, water. Stir the gelatin frequently
  for 3 to
        4    minutes, or until the gelatin granules dissolve completely
  and the mixture is clear. Remove the pan from the heat. Whisk the
  dissolved gelatin mixtureinto the beaten egg mixture. Using a large
  rubber spatula, fold the cooled white chocolate into the mixture.
  Fold one-third of the whipped cream into the mixture to lighten it.
  Fold in the remaining whipped cream.
  
  Assemble the veloutes: Fill a pastry bag fitted with a plain l/2-inch
  round tip with some of the veloute mixture. Pipe a circle of filling
  into the bottom of each mold, on top of the cake round. Pipe more
  veloute to fill in the center of the circle so that the entire cake
  round is covered with a level layer of filling, approximately
  one-third up the side of the mold. In each mold, place 6 to 7
  raspberries in a circle on top of the filling, leaving a l/4-inch
  border of filling around the edge. Place 1 teaspoon of raspberry jam
  in the center of each raspberry circle.
  
  Pipe more veloute filling into each mold, to fill completely. Using a
  small metal cake spatula, scrape the top of each mold to make the
  filling level with the top of the mold. Cover the molds with plastic
  wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight, until set.
  
  Make the warm chocolate curls: Warm the 8-ounce chunk of white
  chocolate by placing it on a piece of waxed paper, then microwave on
  MEDIUM (50 percent) power for 10 second intervals, until the
  chocolate starts to soften slightly. The chocolate should soften
  slightly, not melt.
  
  Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Grip the chocolate chunk with a
  folded paper towel so that your hand does not melt the chocolate.
  Using a sharp vegetable peeler, scrape one of the edges of the
  chocolate chunk in a downward motion, forming loose shavings. As you
  form the curls, let them fall onto the waxed paper. Continue making
  curls until you have enough to garnish just the tops of the veloutes.
  
  Make the crumb garnish: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a
  baking sheet with aluminum foil. Break the reserved sponge cake into
  small pieces and spread in an even layer on the baking sheet. Bake
  5to 7 minutes, until the cake is dry and lightly toasted. Allow the
  cake pieces to cool. Place the cake "toast" in a food processor
  fitted with the metal chopping blade and process 30 to
       45    seconds, or until fine crumbs are formed. Transfer the
  crumbs to a medium bowl.
  
  Make the raspberry sauce: In a medium non-corrosive saucepan, combine
  the raspberries and sugar. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring
  constantly with a wooden spoon, until the sugar dissolves completely
  and the berries soften. Remove the pan from the heat. Strain the
  raspberry mixture through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl. Cover the
  bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the sauce.
  
  Unmold and garnish the veloutes: Remove the molds from the
  refrigerator and gently peel the tape off the seams. Carefully remove
  the molds from the veloutes . Gently pat the cake crumbs around the
  sides of each veloute, covering them evenly from the top edge to the
  bottom. Top the veloutes with the white chocolate curls.

      Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE WHISPER CAKE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 oz White chocolate
  4 1/2 lg Egg whites (4 full fluid
           -ounces)
      1 c  Milk
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      3 c  (300 g) sifted cake flour
      1 c  + 3 tbsp sugar
      1 tb + 1-1/2 tsp baking powder
    3/4 ts Salt
      9 tb Unsalted butter, softened
 
  FROM:      Derek Maddox (The Tally System - 912-328-6183 - (1:36)
  
  Preheat oven to 350øF.  Grease and flour two 9 inch by
    1-1/2    inch cake pans.
  
  In a double boiler melt the chocolate over hot (not simmering) water,
  stirring frequently. Remove from the water.
  
  In a medium bowl lightly combine the egg whites, 1/4 cup milk, and
  vanilla.
  
  In a large mixing bowl combine the dry ingredients and mix on low
  speed for 30 seconds to blend. Add the butter and remaining 3/4 cup
  milk. Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened.
  Increase to medium speed (high speed if using a hand mixer) and beat
  for 1-1/2 minutes to aerate and develop the cake's structure. Scrape
  down the sides. Gradually add the egg mixture in 3 batches, beating
  for 20 seconds after each addition to incorporate the ingredients and
  strengthen the structure. Scrape down the sides. Add the melted
  chocolate and beat to incorporate.
  
  Scrape the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with a
  spatula. The pans will be about 1/2 full. Bake 25 to 35 minutes or
  until a tester inserted near the center comes out clean and the cake
  springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cakes should
  start to shrink from the sides of the pans only after removal from
  the oven.
  
  Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 10 minutes. Loosen the
  sides with a small metal spatula and invert onto greased wire racks.
  To prevent splitting, reinvert so that the tops are up and cool
  completely before wrapping airtight.

      Yield: 12 Servings
 
     24    Quahogs (3 cups chopped meat
           -and liquor)
      3 c  Dry white wine
      2 c  (Approx) fish stock, clam
           -broth or water
      6    Leeks, trimmed and washed
      2    Onions
      4    Stalks celery
      3 oz Salt pork
      6    Strips bacon
    1/3 c  Flour
      3 lg Potatoes, peeled and diced
           Bouquet garni of bay leaf,
           -thyme and parsley
           Salt, pepper and cayenne
           -pepper
      2 c  Peanut oil for frying the
           -leeks
      1 c  Heavy cream
      4 tb Finely chopped chives or
           -parsley
      3 tb Butter
 
  This chowder has two twists: bacon is added in addition to salt pork
  and fried julienned leeks are used as a garnish. The recipe comes
  from Ris Lacoste, chef at 21 Federal St. in Washington.
  
  Scrub the quahogs and place them in a large, covered pot with the
  wine. Steam them for 10 to 15 minutes or until the shells just open.
  Shuck the quahogs and grind with a meat grinder or food processor.
  Strain the cooking liquid through damp cheesecloth - you should have
  2 quarts. If you don'y, add fish stock, clam broth or water to make
  up the difference. Reserve the ground clams and the liquid separately.
  
  Finely chop three of the leeks.  Cut the remaining three leeks into
  fine julienne and reserve them for the garnish. Finely chop the onion
  and celery. Finely dice the salt pork and bacon. Fry the salt pork
  and bacon in a large pot over medium heat to render the fat. Remove
  the cracklings with a slotted spoon. Discard all but 6 tablespoons of
  the fat.
  
  Add the chopped leeks, onion and celery to the pot and gently cook
  for 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft.  Stir in the flour and cook over
  low heat for 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in the reserved liquid and bouquet
  garni and gradually bring to a boil.  Add the potatoes and simmer for
  8 to 10 minutes, or until tender.  Stir in the cream, ground quahogs,
  cracklings, and salt,pepper and cayenne to taste.
  
  Just before serving, heat the oil to 375F.  Fry the julienned leeks
  for 1 minute until crisp.  Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with
  salt. To serve, ladle the chowder into bowls. Place a pat of butter
  in each bowl and garnish with the fried leeks.
  
  Makes 12 servings.

  3. Add the coffee liqueur and stir until smooth.

      Title: WHITE CRACKERS
 Categories: Quickbreads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
      1 tb Sugar
      2 ts Salt; approximately
      2 tb Butter; chilled
    2/3 c  Milk, plus droplets more if
           -needed
 
  Recipe by: The Fannie Farmer Cookbook Preheat oven to 425F. Use
  ungreased cookie sheets. Combine flour, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt
  in a mixing bowl.  Stir the dry ingredients to blend well. Cut the
  butter into small pieces and add the the dry mixture. Using either
  your fingertips or a pastry cutter, cut the bits of butter into the
  dry mixture until it looks like fine crumbs.  Slowly stir in the
  milk, adding enough so the dough pulls away from the sides of the
  bowl. Add a few drops more if the dough seems dry -- it should be
  soft and pliable, not wet and sticky. Divide the dough in half.
  Lightly dust a surface with flour. Roll each half out to a square
  approximately 13 x 13 inches and thinner than 1/8 inch. Trim the
  uneven edges and lift the dough onto the cookie sheet, or roll over a
  rolling pin and unroll onto the cookie sheet. use a sharp knife to
  score the dough into 2-inch squares, cutting almost through the
  dough. Bake 6-8 minutes, or until the edges are slightly golden.
  Remove from the oven and with a large spatula loosen the squares and
  turn them over. Return to the oven and bake for another 5-6 minutes,
  or until the edges are well browned. remove from the oven and slide
  the sheet onto racks to cool. Break the crackrs apart when cool and
  store in an airtight container. these will keep for weeks and taste
  fresh.
  
  Makes 5-dozen 2-inch crackers.

      Title: WHITE FONDANT
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Pound
 
      2 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Water
      2 tb Corn syrup, light
      1 ts Vanilla or lemon flavoring
 
  Place a large platter in refrigerator to chill.
  
  Combine sugar, water, and corn syrup in saucepan. Cook, stirring
  constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Remove spoon. Do not stir candy
  again during cooking.
  
  When candy begins to boil, cover saucepan tightly and let boil 3
  minutes; the steam formed washes down any sugar crystals. Remove
  cover; continue cooking. From time to time, wash away sugar crystals
  which now appear on the sides of the saucepan. For this, use a fork
  wrapped in a piece of cheesecloth and dipped in cold water. (Or--from
  another recipe--use a wet pastry brush.)
  
  Cook to soft ball stage, and 1 minute longer, or 240 F. on candy
  thermometer, for firm fondant for molding. (At 238 F., which is soft
  ball, fondant is suitable for coconut drops, layers in fudge, et
  cetera.)
  
  At 240 F. remove pan from heat; pour fondant at once onto cold, wet
  platter. Let fondant cool to lukewarm. Add flavoring. Beat with
  fondant paddle, spatula, or wide, flat wooden spoon until fondant
  becomes white and creamy. Knead until the mass is smooth and no lumps
  remain.
  
  Put fondant away in covered glass bowl or jar to ripen for 2 or 3 days
  before using. It may be kept longer if tightly covered. Use fondant as
  suggested in various recipes.
  
  "The home candymaker who likes to create professional-looking
  chocolates and other candies must be able to make good fondant. This
  recipe is simplified from a commercial formula. The fondant remains
  creamy and workable. It may be shaped and dipped in chocolate. Some
  may be colored with food coloring. Some may be combined with nuts,
  coconut, chopped candied fruits or combined in layers with fudge,
  caramels, and other mixtures to make logs, squares, and various
  decorative pieces for the sweetmeat tray."

      Title: WHITE FORMULA FOR FACE PAINTING
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 ts White shortening
      5 ts Corn starch
      1 ts White flour
 
  glycerin food color
  
  Use rubber spatula, blend first 3 ingredients on a plate to form a
  smooth paste.  Add 3-4 drops of glycerin for creamy consistency. Any
  food coloring can be added. (I used green. At that time my kid was
  "into" THE HULK)
  
  For brown beards, or caveman styles, just add 2-1/2 tsp cocoa to the
  above mixture.
  
  My kids thought it was great....and this goes back many years, since
  my youngest is now 18.  The only problem I encountered was that over
  time (couple of hours) the heat from the faces, tended to make the
  solution shiny and it started to melt.  But it is better than using
  regular make-up, or spending money on store bought if you are short
  of funds.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 9" cake
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      8 oz White chocolate, finely
           .chopped
      3 c  Sifted cake flour
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Stick unsalted butter (1/2c)
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      3 lg Eggs
      2 ts Vanilla
      1 c  + 1 T milk

MMMMM--------------------FILLING AND FROSTING-------------------------
  1 1/2 lb White chocolate, finely
           .chopped
  2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      6 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped macadamia
           .nuts

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           White macadamia nuts &
           Strawberries or raspberries
 
  1. Preheat oven to 350F. Butter and flour 2 9-inch cake pans. 2. Make
  the Cake: In a double boiler, melt the white chocolate over hot, not
  simmering, water. Set aside to cool slightly. 3. In a large bowl with
  an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs one
  at a time, beating well after each addition. On low speed, add the
  melted chocolate and the vanilla. In three additions, on low speed,
  alternately beat in the flour mixture and the milk. Beat until just
  smooth, about 20 seconds. 4. Pour the batter into the prepared pans
  and bake for 25 - 30 minutes or until the top is golden and a cake
  tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Set the cake pans on a
  wire rack to cool for 20 minutes. Then invert the cakes onto the
  racks to cool completely. 5. Prepare the Filling and Frosting: Place
  the white chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small heavy saucepan,
  bring 1 1/2 cups of the cream and the butter to a simmer. Pour over
  the chocolate. Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes, then stir until
  smooth. Refrigerate the white chocolate mixture until firm enough to
  spread, about 1 hour. 6. To Assemble: Spread the bottom layer with 1
  cup of the chilled white chocolate mixture. Arrange the chopped
  macadamia nuts over the filling, and top with the second cake layer.
  7. In a medium bowl, beat the remaining 1 cup cream until firm peaks
  form. Fold the whipped cream into the remaining white chocolate
  mixture. Spread this over the top and sides of the cake. Arrange
  whole macadamia nuts around the rim and base of the cake. Chill until
  ready to serve. Garnish each piece with a fanned strawberry or
  raspberries.

  Place the bones and water in a large stock kettle. Bring to a boil
  and skim well.  Add the remaining ingredients, turn the heat down to
  low, and simmer for 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Strain through a cheesecloth
  lined strainer and allow to cool; then skim off the fat, and chill.
  The cold stock will be quite gelatinous.

      Title: WHITE OSSO BUCCO
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 sl Veal shank, each about
           -1 1/2 - 2 inches thick
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/3 c  Butter, unsalted
      3 c  White wine, dry
           -(or less)
      1    Lemon
      8 tb Parsley (fresh),
           -chopped fine
           Flour, salt and pepper
 
  Dredge the veal shank pieces well in flour.  In a large skillet with
  high sides, heat the olive oil and butter over moderately high heat
  until the butter stops foaming. If you do not have a skillet large
  enough to accommodate all of the meat in a single layer, use two
  smaller pans.
  
  Add the veal shanks to the skillet and arrange in a single layer.
  Cook over moderately high heat until browned on one side. Add a
  generous amount of salt and pepper. Turn meat and brown the other
  side, and add salt and pepper.
  
  Add enough white wine to nearly, but not quite, cover the meat.
  Reduce heat to a barely bubbling simmer. Cover with a well-fitting
  lid. Cook at a simmer for 2
      1/2    hours.
  
  Peel a thin layer of rind from the lemon.  (I find that a vegetable
  peeler gives me a nice thin layer of rind.) Cut rind into fine strips.
  
  Remove veal shanks to a warm plate.  The meat will be
  falling-off-the-bone tender, so a wide spatula is advised for this
  step to keep each shank intact. Keep meat warm through the next
  several steps.
  
  Add lemon peel and chopped parsley to the sauce and place over high
  heat. Boil vigorously for several minutes to reduce sauce slightly.
  Stir to loosen any brown bits from the pan and then frequently to
  prevent burning.
  
  Remove from heat and return shanks to skillet.  Spoon sauce over
  shanks and replace skillet lid.  Let sit for 3-5 minutes to reheat
  shanks. Serve with sauce over shanks.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Braised veal shanks in white wine -- This recipe is adapted from
  Marcella Hazan's "More Classic Italian Cooking." Simple to make, this
  dish beats any "traditional" osso bucco with tomatoes and vegetables
  that I've had in the U.S. or Italy.
  
  *  Veal shanks are a relatively inexpensive cut of meat. If possible,
  ask your butcher to use hind shanks which have more meat than do the
  forelegs. The key to this dish is the quality of the ingredients. I
  use the best olive oil (Italian, virgin first-press, cold-press) and
  table quality dry white wine (fume or sauvignon blanc) I can find at
  a reasonable price.
  
  *  For dredging, rather than using a plate of flour, I put about 2/3
  cup flour in a plastic bag, put in the shanks one at a time, and
  shake to thoroughly cover all sides of the meat with flour.
  
  *  The flavor of the dish is light so I usually serve with a home-made
  pasta dish with a cream-based sauce and a steamed green vegetable. Be
  sure to have plenty of crusty bread on hand to soak up the sauce. For
  those who like the marrow, don't forget to spoon it out of the shanks.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      6    Shitake mushrooms; cut

           -(dried work fine)
           Butter
           Flour
           Cream or milk
 
  Ross Thompson mentioned something called "Pasta From Hell". Here's a
  quick and dirty rendition that I've been making. It's good hot (sic)
  or cold.
  
  To 1 can of Progresso White Clam sauce (the stuff in the jar is a bit
  better), add about half a dozen shitake (cut), several chopped
  scallions, and 2-4 finely chopped Habs (dried work fine). Let the
  sauce simmer about 20 minutes, then thicken with a little butter &
  flour and add enough cream or milk to make sauce look white.
  
  You can, of course, add more/less habanero as you see fit. I made a
  cold pasta like this (2 cans sauce, 1/2 of a hab) for a party, and it
  went over very well.

 Categories: Pizza, Italian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  :          ---PIZZA DOUGH ------
    4 3/4 c  white flour
        2 c  warm water -- 105 degrees
        3 ts dry yeast
        1 ts salt
        1 TB olive oil
  :          ---TOPPING ------
  :          olive oil
  :          coarse Kosher salt (sea
  :          salt)
  :          dried rosemary
  
  Dissolve yeast in the warm water.  Add yeast/water mixture to 3 cups
  of the flour.   Mix, adding regular salt and olive oil a little at a
  time. Add the rest of the flour bit by bit until the dough "feels
  right".
  
  Turn dough onto a floured board and knead; adding more flour if
  necessary to keep  the dough from sticking to your fingers. Put the
  dough in a greased bowl and rotate to distribute the grease all over
  the dough. Let rise until about double  in size (approx. 2 hours).
  
  Remove the dough, punch down and roll out on the floured board to a
  thickness of  3/8 to 1/2 inch (make it any shape you desire). Put
  dough in a pan or cookie sheet. With a pastry brush, paint liberally
  with additional olive oil.  Use your  thumb and 2 fingers to make
  dimples over the entire surface. Sprinkle the Kosher sea salt and
  rosemary over the surface of the dough.  Let rise a little more.
  
  Bake at 375 degrees F for about 25 minutes.  When done, paint
  liberally again with olive oil.
  
  Makes 1 white pizza.

  Bring milk, onions, carrots, celery, parsley, 3 shallots, garlic
  clove, bay leaves, salt, cloves, pepper, nutmeg and thyme just to
  boil in heavy 4-quart saucepan over medium heat. Remove from het,
  cover and let stand 30 minutes. Refrigerate until mixture is well
  chilled, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, melt 1 Tbsp butter in heavy small
  skillet over low heat. Add remaining 4 minced shallots. Cover and
  cook until very soft, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Puree
  with on/off turns in processor with pork, pork fat, eggs, flour, Port
  and 1/4 tsp garlic until smooth. Strain milk into processor, pressing
  down on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Blend into
  puree.  Transfer to large bowl. Stir in currants. Refrigerate 1 to 8
  hours. (If processor has small capacity, puree in batches.) Cut
  sausage casings into 3-foot lengths. Tie knot at one end of each.
  Gather 1 piece around tip of pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch plain
  tip. Spoon pork mixture into pastry bag, pressing down to prevent air
  pockets. Pipe mixture into casing, twisting casing every 6 inches to
  create individual sausages. Tie know at end of casing. Repeat with
  remaining pork and casings.  Tie twists in sausage with string. Bring
  8 quarts water to boil in stockpot. Remove from heat and add
  sausages. Return pot to heat, adjusting as necessary to maintain
  water just below simmer (180 F). Cook until sausages are firm to
  touch, 20 minutes, turning occasionally. Cool in cold water to retain
  plumpness.  Cut into individual links. (Can be prepared ahead to this
  point. Wrap and refrigerate up to 3 days or freeze up to 2 months.)
  Melt butter in heavy skillet over medium heat. Lightly brown sausages
  on all sides, about 8 minutes total. Serve hot. (Sausage can also be
  grilled.)

  cold water to cover rice. Wash rice by rubbing rice gently between
  fingers. Drain. Wash rice 5 or 6 times or until water is clear.

      Title: WHITE ROSE TOILET SOAP
 Categories: Household, Herb/spices
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 lb Hydrogenated vegetable oil
           .  or lard
      2 oz Coconut oil
      4 oz Commercial lye; dissolved
           .  in cold water
      1 oz Baking soda
      1 tb Salt
      1 oz Glycerine
      3 dr Essential oil of rose
 
  Place the water, lye and grease into a large kettle on a medium
  flame. Stir continuously with a large wooden spoon.
  
  The water will evaporate as the mixture thickens. The mixture will
  thicken and spit up like gravy, indicating that sponification has
  taken place.
  
  Remove the mixture from the stove, stir it to help it cool evenly. It
  is important to stir the hot soap while it is heating to prevent it
  from scorching on the bottom of the pan.
  
  Add the remaining ingredients, except for the perfume. Add color if
  desired.
  
  Add perfume. Pour into molds.
  
  NOTE:  Saturated fats usually give a better performance in soap
  making, which is why lard and tallow were once used exclusively in
  this process. Hydrogenated vegetable oils, however, which are solid
  at room temperature, can be excellent substitutes for lard or tallow
  and are generally preferred by vegetarians. Liquid vegetable oils can
  be used, but you might need to reheat several times to get a hard
  soap. Unless you like the smell of peanuts, avoid using peanut oil.

 Categories: Sauce, Woman's day
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
      3 tb Butter
      3 tb Flour
      2 c  Milk
    1/2 ts Salt
        x  Freshly ground black pepper
 
  1.  In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter* over low heat, until foamy.
  With a wooden spoon, stir in the flour until a thick paste forms.
  This is called a "roux."
  
  2.  Whisk in the milk until smooth.  Stirring occasionally, cook 10
  to 12 minutes, until simmering, thick, and smooth. Simmer 2 minutes
  to "cook out" the flour taste.
  
  3.  Season with the salt and freshly ground black pepper.
  
  TIP:  * If you brown the butter slightly after it has melted (don't
  burn it!), it will add a nutty flavor to the sauce.

           Finely chopped white onion
           Roughly chopped cilantro
           Lime quarters
 
  Put the calf's food pieces, garlic, onion, and half the salt in a
  large pan.  Put the tripe on top with the remaining salt, cover the
  pan, and cook over very low heat so that is simmers for about 3
  hours. Strain the meat, reserving the broth, and cut the tripe into
  small squares ~ about 1 1/2 inches.  Remove the bones from the calf's
  foot and chop the flesh roughly. Return the meats to the pan with the
  broth, the flowered hominy, and the hominy cooking water. Taste for
  salt and continue cooking over very low heat for 1 hour. Serve in
  deep bowls with flour tortillas, passing around the toppings.

      Title: WHITE STOCK
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        5 ga Water
       10 Lb Beef Bones -- sawn
       10 Lb Veal Bones -- sawn
        5 Lb Chicken Backs -- or feet
      1/2    Celery Stalk -- chopped
        1    Leek -- chopped
        2    Onions -- chopped
      1/2 bn Parsley Stems
        5    Bay Leaves
        1 TB Peppercorns -- crushed
      1/2 TB Thyme Leaf
  
  1. Blanch the bones by covering with cold water and bringing to the
  boil. Discard water and rinse bones.
  
  2. Add remaining ingredients. Bring to the boil, then simmer for up
  to 18 hours, with skimming to remove any scum that rises.
  
  3. Scald clean containers, and strain stock into each, seeing some
  fat into each to act as a protective cap. Cover with saran and cool.
  
  4. This will keep at least a week, but should be part of the regular
  weekly Mise en place. Excess should be frozen or reduced for glace
  d'viand, a 10-1 reduction.
  
  NOTES:
  
  These recipes are for 5 gallons, but you can cut them in half. It
  hardly pays to make less than 10 quarts, but if space is a factor,
  reduce the stock by boiling to half its original volume. The flavors
  will be more pronounced, as will any errors introduced.

      Title: WHITE-FLOUR SOURDOUGH STARTER
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      2 c  Tepid (80) water
      1 pk Yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 c  Flour
 
  Mix the water, sugar and yeast until dissolved.  Beat in the flour
  until the batter is smooth.  Pour into a clean 2 qt. jar and cover
  with a cloth. Let stand at room temp. for 2 to 3 days or until
  starter has a sharp, almost winy odor and is bubbly (it will be full
  of lively bubbles after a short time and will continue to bubble,
  more sedately, until it is sufficiently sour). Exact times can't be
  given, as weather and temp affect the rate of fermentation.
     TO USE:  If not used at once, cover the starter with a lid and
  refrigerate it.  It will be lively enough to use for about 18 hrs; if
  refrigerated longer, "feed" it lightly and let it become bubbly at
  room temp - usually letting it stand overnight - before using it.
     This tangy batter is the key ingredient of English Muffins and many
  other sourdough breads.  This recipe makes 3 cups enough to make a
  large batch of muffins, with enough left over to serve as a nucleus
  for a future baking.  The starter keeps well in a covered jar in the
  refrigerator so long as it is "fed" with a small amount of flour and
  an equal amount of water about every 2 weeks - this keeps the yeasts
  alive. Or freeze it for indefinite storage.  To revive it, feed it
  after it thaws and let it stand at room temperature until bubbly
  enough to use. If liquid gathers on the surface of stored starter,
  stir it in before adding flour and water. Your starter will be good
  so long as it responds to feeding and has a pleasantly odor.  If
  neglected, it may develop a pink or greenish tinge and an unpleasant
  odor.  If that should happen, start over. To increase a small amount
  of leftover starter to a quantity large enough for a baking, add
  flour and water in equal quantities, but never exceed the proportion
  of a cup of flour to a cup of starter.  Let the mix ferment, lightly
  covered, at room temp until very bubbly; then, if you need still more
  starter, add more flour and water and ferment again.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Whole fish
           -- preferably fresh
      4    Shallots; peeled
           -- finely chopped
      8 md Mushrooms; sliced
      6    Fresh dill sprigs
           Salt & white pepper to taste

    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      2    To 3 tb. beurre manie

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Whole dill sprigs
           Dilled lemon slices
 
  Enright writes: "In Canada, fresh whiting is sold most months, while
  springtime and summer bring a selection of...salmon, trout, pickerel
  and perch.  Fresh or frozen fillets (sole, perch, haddock, turbot)
  may be substituted, but be sure to reduce cooking time."
  
  Have the fish "dressed," that is, scaled, eviscerated and fins
  removed. To behead or not is up to you.  To bake fish, the rule of
  thumb is: 10 minutes per inch thickness of fresh fish (measured at
  its thickest point) or for frozen fish, 20 minutes cooking time for
  each inch thickness.
  
  Butter an oval baking dish large enough to hold fish. Sprinkle pan
  with half the shallots, mushrooms and dill sprigs. Lay fish on top.
  Season with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Place remaining shallots,
  mushrooms and dill sprigs on top of fish; dot with butter.
  
  Combine clam juice or stock with white wine; pour around fish. Loosely
  cover pan with foil and bake at 450 F. until fish flakes when tested
  with a fork. Remove fish to heated platter. Debone and keep warm in
  low oven. Strain pan juices into a medium, heavy saucepan. Discard
  dill but reserve shallots and mushrooms. Add cream and boil over high
  heat to reduce sauce by one third.  Whisk in beurre manie a bit at a
  time until the sauce is sufficiently thick. Season with salt, pepper
  and lemon juice. Add reserved shallots and mushrooms. Pour some sauce
  over baked fish and serve remainder separately.
  
  Garnish with whole dill sprigs and dilled lemon slices. (For these,
  mince dill and place on cutting board. Gently fold a lemon slice in
  half and roll onto the minced dill to form a center band of dill.)
  
  Serve with white rice seasoned with fresh lemon thyme and sauteed baby
  carrots or broiled tomato halves.

      Title: WHOLE GRAIN PUMPKIN BREAD
 Categories: Vegetables, Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Oil or butter
  1 1/2 c  Firmly packed light brown
           -sugar
    1/2 c  Molasses
      2    Eggs, well beaten
     16 oz Can pumpkin (Libby's)
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour*
    1/3 c  Wheat bran*
    1/3 c  Oat bran*
    1/3 c  Wheat germ*
      2 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Cloves
      1 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Pecans, finely chopped
           -(optional)
 
  * This recipe uses a lot of whole grains, but it will turn out
  excellently if you use all-purpose flour in place of any or all of
  the whole grains. Also, any of the whole grains are interchangeable
  with any of the other whole grains in the recipe.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease 2 loaf pans. Beat oil, brown
  sugar, and molasses until well blended. Blend in egg and pumpkin.
  Stir flours, brans, wheat germ, soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and
  salt into mixture just until moistened.  Fold in nuts. Fill pans and
  bake about 1 hour, until pick comes out clean. Cool on rack. Better
  if served the day after cooking.
  
  This bread freezes well.

      Title: WHOLE OR HALVED TOMATOES (PACKED IN TOMATO JU
 Categories: Canning
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Quantity: An average of 21 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
  quarts; an average of 13 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
  A bushel weighs 53 pounds and yields 15 to 21 quarts-an average of 3
  pounds per quart.
  
  Procedure: Wash tomatoes. Dip in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds or
  until skins split, then dip in cold water. Slip off skins and remove
  cores. Leave whole or halve. Add bottled lemon juice or citric acid
  to the jars (See acidification instructions). Add 1 teaspoon of salt
  per quart to the jars, if desired.
  
  Raw pack -- Heat tomato juice in a saucepan. Fill jars with raw
  tomatoes, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Cover tomatoes in the jars with
  hot tomato juice, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.
  
  Hot pack -- Put tomatoes in a large saucepan and add enough tomato
  juice to completely cover them. Boil tomatoes and juice gently for 5
  minutes. Fill jars with hot tomatoes, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Add
  hot tomato juice to the jars to cover the tomatoes, leaving 1/2-inch
  headspace. Adjust lids and process according to the recommendations
  in Table 1, Table 2 or Table 3 depending on the method used.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Whole suckling pig
           -(10-14 lb), oven-ready
           -(have your butcher clean
           - and trim it)
    1/3 c  Plain distilled vinegar
  1 1/2 c  Carrots, chopped or sliced
  1 1/2 c  Celery, chopped or sliced
  1 1/2 c  Onions, chopped or sliced
    1/3 c  Safflower oil
      1 tb Coarse salt
      1 ts Thyme
           Stuffing (optional) *
           - *(instead of vegetables)
           Olive oil
      1 c  Stock
      1 c  Wine
      1 sm Red apple
      1 bn Watercress
      2 tb Flour
      2 tb Butter
 
  THE DAY BEFORE COOKING, WASH pig inside and out; soak it in very cold
  water with vinegar for a few hours. This freshens and whitens the
  meat. If you pig is frozen, it can also defrost during this soaking.
  Over a medium heat cook the carrots, celery and onions in the oil for
  a good 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The onions should become
  somewhat translucent, the carrots slightly caramelized. Add salt and
  thyme. Dry the pig thoroughly inside and out. You may stuff the pig
  with the vegetables at this time; however, if you use a conventional
  stuffing, such as one for a turkey, wait until just before cooking
  and make certain that the pig and stuffing are at room temperature.
  The easiest way to close the opening is to use an ice pick or an
  upholstery needle to punch rows of holes about an inch apart on both
  sides of the stomach flaps. Then lace it up with thick string just as
  you would a shoe. You may also use skewers and string as you would
  for a turkey. Because protein firms as it cooks, the pig will stay in
  whatever position you place it. It should resemble a dog resting on
  its haunches. Place the pig in the roasting pan; it may have to be
  placed diagonally. Tuck the hind legs close to the stomach on either
  side; tie them together with string under the stomach if needed. The
  forelegs should be pointing straight ahead (also tied together so
  they won't spread out) and the head resting between them. Place a
  small piece of wood (like a child's block) or a piece of bunched-up
  foil in the mouth, opening it as wide as you can. Twist the tail into
  a curl and secure it with string or tape. Place crumpled aluminum
  foil in the eye sockets (some people place marbles). At this point
  you may cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it. Before cooking
  the pig, let it come to room temperature. Preheat oven to 450F. With
  the oil, thoroughly baste every inch of the pig, including the head,
  legs and tail. Out of aluminum foil make little covers for the ears
  and tail. If your pig hangs over the pan, use heavy-duty foil to
  extend the pan so that any juices will be collected. Place the pig in
  the oven for 30 minutes. Remove the pig quickly, shutting the oven
  door, baste with oil again and return to the oven. Then reduce the
  temperature to 350F. Continue basting with oil every 20 minutes 4 to
  5 more times (for a total of 2 hours). If the ears and tail haven't
  browned, remove the aluminum covers for the last 20 minutes. The
  total cooking time will be between 2 and 2 1/2 hours. The cooking
  time is less because it is not fully stuffed; if it were, it would
  take an hour longer. (Approximately 10 minutes per pound lightly
  stuffed or unstuffed; 15 minutes per pound fully stuffed.) The pig is
  done when the temperature of the thigh reaches 165F (trichinae are
  killed when the internal temperature reaches 139F for a period of 10
  minutes). When done, it may easily rest for an hour under foil or in
  a turned-off oven. To serve, make a garland for the pig's neck by
  stringing together sprigs of watercress. Make certain your apple is
  nicely polished. Enlist some help and very carefully slide the pig
  onto the platter or carving board it will be presented on. It is
  rather fragile at this point and can even break in half. Make a sauce
  by skimming the fat off the juices in the roasting pan. Place the
  roasting pan over 2 burners, add the stock and the wine and bring to
  the simmer. Stir to dissolve all the roasting juices coagulated on
  the bottom and continue cooking about 10 minutes. If you wish to
  thicken the sauce, whisk in 2 tablespoons of flour that have been
  blended with 2 tablespoons of butter, bring the sauce back to the
  boil and boil for 2 minutes, stirring. Remove any remaining foil,
  string or skewers. Place the apple in the pig's mouth. Place the
  watercress garland around its neck and bring it to the table.

  sauce:------ POACH THE SALMON: To time the poaching, measure the fish
  and allow 10 minutes for each inch of thickness; begin timing when
  the liquid starts to simmer. To check for doneness, insert a metal
  skewer into the thick flesh behind the gill. It should slide in
  easily. A six-pound salmon needs either a fish poacher or a roasting
  pan fitted with a rack at the bottom for easy fish lifting. I use a
  roaster. It usually means the fish has been curved to fit in, and the
  benefit of this is that it retains this jaunty pose once cooked so it
  fits more easily onto a platter. Chill it carefully, then unwrap it,
  and gently pull off the skin. If the fat underneath the skin is gray,
  scrape it away with a knife to reveal the orange flesh. Cut down the
  center of the fish to the backbone, and then ease one half of the
  fillet from the bones. Gently pull off the flesh, then remove the
  backbone and replace the fish. This way it is easier to serve at a
  buffet. Peel and halve the cucumbers. Scrape out the seeds, and then
  thinly slice them. Arrange cucumber on top of the salmon in a pattern
  resembling fish scales. Slice a lemon, and arrange around the fish.
  Chill well. For the sauce, combine the sour cream with the
  mayonnaise, and whisk until smooth. Add the onion, lemon juice, dill,
  salt and pepper. Serves 10 to 12, or more if there are other entrees.
  Note: The fish can be cooked up to a day in advance and refrigerated,
  tightly covered. The sauce can be made up to two days in advance and
  refrigerated.

 Categories: Quick bread
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS (BNVX05A)
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Oil
      1 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Molasses
  1 1/3 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 c  Flour
    3/4 c  Oat bran flakes
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Dates; chopped
      1 c  Walnuts; chopped
 
    Beat together first 5 ingredients until blended. Mix together the
  remaining ingredients and add all at once. Beat until blended. Do not
  overbeat.
    Divide batter between 5 greased mini-loaf pans (6x3x2-inches) and
  bake in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes, or until a cake
  tester, inserted in center, comes out clean.  Allow to cool in pan
  for 10 minutes, and then remove from pans and continue cooling on a
  rack. Yields: 5 mini-loaves.
  
  Note:  Oat bran can be purchased in most supermarkets or health food
  stores.  It comes as "milled" or "stone-ground". The milled is finer
  in texture and the stone-ground will produce a slightly coarser
  crumb, which adds a little character to this country-style loaf.

  If you don't like making bagels but want the texture of bagels with
  the low-fat nutritional benefits; try this bread. It tastes like a
  bagel and is especially good sliced and toasted.
  
  There is one note for the Panasonic/National machines and that is to
  use 3 tsp yeast for 1 1/2 lb loaf.  I believe that this is for the
  older Panasonics as I do remember Linda Rehberg saying that the newer
  models came out after their book was published and that the yeast
  amounts in her book were not for the newer Panasonics. Upon
  re-reading I found I missed one thing. I did add a few more tsps of
  water as the dough ball was not forming to my liking.  Let me know if
  you make this and how you like it.

  very warm water. Add honey to yeast. Coat loaf pans well with
  margarine and flour. Add oil, 2-1/2 cups warm water, and 2T salt
  yeast. Add about 4c flour mixture and beat at medium speed for 2
  minutes. Gradually add more flour, beating well. Dough should be
  sticky - if runny, add more flour. Put in pans, smoothing top and
  making sure dough is pushed into corners. Cover with hot, wet towel
  and let rise in warm place. Check bread in about 20 minutes and keep
  checking to be sure dough doesn't rise over lip of pan. When dough

  board. Turn dough onto the board. Knead dough, adding flour to board
  until the dough no longer sticks. Continue kneading until dough is
  not sticky (about 8 minutes). Put dough into a greased bowl about
  three times the size of the dough. Turn dough to grease surface
  lightly. Cover bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place for
  about 2 hours, or until double in bulk. Test by inserting a finger
  about 1/2 inch into dough. If indentation remains, the dough is ready
  to shape. Punch dough down; squeeze out air bubbles and shape into a
  smooth ball. Let rise again in warm place for about 30 minutes.
  Divide into equal portions for 2 loaves. Form each into a smooth oval
  loaf. Let stand covered for 15 minutes. Place the loaves seam side
  down in 2 greased 9x5x3-inch loaf pans. Cover with a towel and let
  rise in warm place until almost double in bulk (about 1 hour). Bake
  at 375F about 30 minutes, or until crust is medium brown. Turn out of
  pans at once. Cool on wire racks.

  mixer if you want your cake especially light). Bake in a Pam sprayed
  8 or 9 inch square pan at 350F (180 C) for 30-35 minutes or until
  toothpick-test done.* I didn't use a frosting-it was very moist and

  and powdered sugar and frost with that.
  
  *insert toothpick into center of cake.   If it comes out clean, the
  cake is done.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      2 tb Yeast
    3/4 c  Water, warm
  1 3/4 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
    1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 tb Honey
      2 c  Butter, 1/2" pieces
      1    Egg
      1 tb Water
 
  Combine yeast and warm water, stirring a little to dissolve yeast.
  Let sit about 10 minutes.  Add 1/2 of flour; add water and honey;
  whisk until smooth.  Cover bowl and let stand 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Combine remaining flour with butter, and flatten butter pieces. Pour
  yeast batter into flour mixture; fold together with spatula; just
  moisten flour without breaking butter pieces.
  
  Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.  Pat dough down and roll
  into a 18" x 12" rectangle; if too sticky, sprinkle with flour. Use a
  metal spatula to fold 1/3 of dough toward center; then fold from
  other side, 1/3 of dough over first 1/3. Lift folded dough off work
  surface, and scrape surface clean. Sprinkle work area with flour and
  repeat, rolling and folding 3 more times. Dough must be hard; if not,
  freeze for 45 minutes.
  
  Pat dough into rectangle.  Cut into parts, 1 part for each 4
  croissants. For instance, for 24 croissants: cut in 1/2 lengthwise,
  then cut each half into 3 pieces, for a total of 6 (4x6=24). Work
  with one piece at a time, holding others in refrigerator until ready
  to use. Roll each piece individually into 5 1/2" x 14" rectangles.
  Cut into two 5 1/2" x 7" pieces. Cut each piece diagonally to form 4
  triangles; roll from wide end to point. Place on ungreased cookie
  sheets. Curve ends to crescent shape.
  
  Beat egg with water; brush croissants with this and set them aside 1
  hour. Reglaze with egg/water mixture. Bake at 375 degrees until
  puffed and brown. Let cool slightly and serve.

      1 c  Water
  1 1/2 tb Canola oil
      2 tb Honey
    1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Oats (I use quick oats)

  1 1/2 ts Yeast
    1/2 c  Chopped dates
    1/2 c  Chopped almonds
 
  The dates and almonds can be added at the beep, but I usually add
  them at the very beginning for better distribution. We like this
  spread with cream cheese, but it's also good just as it is! I always
  keep the machine open at the very beginning kneading and add flour by
  the tablespoon as is neaded until it's no longer sticky. Living in a
  high humidity climate sometimes I need to add quite a lot when I
  don't cut down the liquid. Guess I should be keeping an eye on the
  humidity before I begin baking! Thanks for your recipe.  We used to
  live near Lancaster. Rhonda

      2 tb Whole dill SEED
  1 1/2 tb Olive oil; - or butter
 
  Warm together the water; cottage cheese, yogurt, sugar, onion, dill
  seed and oil in microwave for about 30 seconds or until warm to the
  touch (about 110 deg). Set aside. Place all other ingredients above
  into the bread pan in order listed. Add warmed ingredients. Select
  white bread setting (other brands of B/M's may have a whole wheat
  setting), but the white bread setting works on the DAK. Set
  light/dark setting on side of B/M to 11 o'clock. Press Start. Open
  lid after dough has kneaded about 2 mins. Press dough lightly with
  fingertip. If wet, sticky dough adheres to your fingertip OR dough is
  not forming into one soft ball (NO sticky dough on bottom of pan),
  add 1 Tablespoon or more flour until dough is just slightly tacky and
  makes one soft ball of dough. Judy Garnett --- Hope this does well
  for you. I use my elec. knife to slice the bread top to bottom down
  the center first. Then place the two cut sides down and slice them
  thin. This makes a great sandwich bread or is good toasted with a
  little diet margarine spread.  Best regards, Judy Garnett 11/07 11:18

  plastic wrap. Let stand about 15 min.
  
  Preheat an ungreased frypan.  Shape each ball into a very flat 4"
  round patty.  Roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 6 in circle.
  Cook each round on preheated frypan until bubbles form on top, and
  underside is flecked with brown but not too crisp and still flexible.
  
  Stack cooked tortillas, cover with a dry cloth towel. Serve
  immediately or reheat in 350F oven before serving.
  
  Cut in wedges and crisp to make chips for dips or serve with melted
  cheese and chilies as nachos.

      Title: WHOLE WHEAT FRENCH BREAD
 Categories: Breads, French
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Active dry yeast
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Lite salt
  2 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
      3 c  White flour
      2 c  Whole wheat flour(or 3)
      1 ea Egg white+1 T cold water
 
  Combine yeast, sugar,lite salt and water in a large bowl. Gradually
  add the flours and mix well(hands work best). At first the dough will
  be very sticky; add enough flour to transfer it to a lightly floured
  board. Knead until the dough is no longer sticky(about 10 minutes),
  adding more flour as necessary. Place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover
  with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in
  volume(1 1/2-2 hours). Punch dough down. Transfer to a floured board
  and cut into four equal parts. Roll and shape each part into a long
  loaf. Place loaves into a lightly oiled, special long-loaf
  pans(baguette pans). Slash the top of each loaf diagonally in three
  or four places and brush with egg white and water mixture. Let dough
  rise another hour or until doubled in volume. Preheat oven to 350
  degrees. Bake the loaves until browned and hollow-sounding when
  thumped, about 25 minutes.* Halfway through baking, it may be
  necessary to cover the loaves with foil to prevent scorching the
  tops. Let cool on rack. Makes 4 loaves, about 18 inches long. * If
  planning to freeze bread, underbake,i.e., bake in oven only 15
  minutes. Wrap in foil when cool.Freeze. When ready to serve remove
  from freezer. Leave wrapped in foil. Place in 350 degree oven for 10
  minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake for 5 minutes, until crisp.

  For Bread Machine:  Put the ingredients into the pan in the order

  This is a very moist cake-like bread, and one of our favorites. Makes
  1 loaf. Scratch Method: Combine whole wheat flour and 1 cup of the
  Better for bread flour, yeast and Caraway seed. Heat the water,
  molasses, brown sugar, shortening and salt, just till warm, stirring
  to melt the shortening. Add to the dry mix.  In an electric mixer,
  beat at low speed for 30 seconds, then on high speed for 3 minutes.
  Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough. Knead
  the dough until smooth and elastic. Shape in a ball and let rise in a
  greased bowl, until doubled. I speed up the rising by placing the
  bowl of dough in the overn with the light turned on. Punch the dough
  down and divide in half.
   Shape in 2 loaves. Let rise on a greased baking sheet, until double.
  Bake at 375 degrees 30 to 35 minutes. If you like the crust really
  chew, brush the bread with warm water during the last 10 to 15
  minutes of the baking. Remove from the sheet and cool on racks. Makes
  2 loaves I have made this bread for many years. It is almost like
  eating cake! My husband said he couldn't tell the difference between
  when I made this from scratch, and making it in the bread machine.

  Fill well-oiled muffin tins 2/3 full.  Bake about 25 minutes.
  
  If sour cream is used, omit 1/2 shortening.
  
  Sylvia's comments: the batter was too liquidy, and the baking times
  were too long.  I'll use 1/4 c less liquid next time. They were done
  after 20 minutes. They also stuck to the paper liners, so need more
  oil.

      1 ea Egg
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour, less abou

      1 tb Butter Buds
    1/2 c  Raisins or currants
      1 x  (or see below)
 
      Mix and bake as above.  However, I recommend dividing the batch
  into two rounds rather than one, so that the scones are smaller. They
  are not structurally strong, and the smaller scones are easier to
  handle. Further variations: 1. Whether making the original or my
  variation, I sprinkle the rounds
      before cutting and baking with sugar and cinnamon. 2. At
  end-of-year holiday time I substitute the mixed candied fruits
      seasonally available for the raisins or currants. 3. For a maple
  flavor, substitute REAL maple syrup for the milk,
      eliminate the sugar, and add dried milk. 4. Chop 1/2 cup walnuts
  and add to either the original or the whole
      wheat batch.

      Title: WHOLE WHEAT SESAME CRACKERS
 Categories: Breads, Appetizers, Snacks, Vegetables
      Yield: 72 Crackers
 
      6 tb Sesame seeds; plus...
    1/2 c  Sesame seeds
      1 c  Water
      3 tb Canola or safflower oil
      1 ts Fine sea salt
  2 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/2 ts Nonaluminum baking powder
 
  Surprise your family or guests with freshly baked crackers. For
  special occasions, use cookie cutters to make them into imaginative
  shapes. Serve them with a dip for an appetizer or pack them in a
  lunch. Crackers will keep for two to three weeks stored in an
  airtight container. If the crackers lose some of their crispness,
  heat them at 250 F for about 5 minutes.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Position two racks in the center and the
  bottom third of the oven, and preheat the oven to 350 F.
  
  Spread 2 tablespoons sesame seeds on each of three unoiled baking
  sheets. This will prevent the crackers from sticking and will give
  them a delicious crisp bottom.
  
  Put the water, oil, and salt in a small bowl until combined. Stir in
  the 1/2 cup sesame seeds.  Add the water-oil mixture and mix to form
  a rough dough. Knead the dough in the bowl to form a ball, and turn
  out onto a lightly floured work surface.
  
  Lightly flour a rolling pin.  Roll the dough out into a 22- by 14-inch
  rectangle, about 1/16-inch thick. Using a fork, prick the dough all
  over to release trapped air and keep the dough flat. With a pizza
  wheel or sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares or other
  shapes, or cut shapes with a 2-inch cookie cutter.
  
  Using a spatula, transfer the crackers to the prepared baking sheets.
  Bake until the crackers are light brown and firm to the touch, 15 to
  20 minutes, switching the positions of the sheets halfway through the
  baking time. When the first two sheets are finished, remove them, and
  bake the third one as directed.  Cool completely.

  I used the whole wheat starter and experimented with your whole wheat
  bread recipe in the DAK today. It turned out great. Basically, I just
  halved your recipe and added a few things. My DAK is a 3 cup flour
  model, is yours? If I'm using whole wheat or rye flour, I can add
  more flour because it doesn't rise as much.  Also, whenever I use
  whole wheat, etc. I add vital wheat gluten and lecithin to aid
  elasticity and to help it rise. This is what I put in the DAK and the
  order I used: Turn the light/dark setting to 12 o'clock and set the
  menu to Sweet Bread (the auto. one, not the manual one) Later, at the
  beeps, I added 3/4 c. pecans (didn't have walnuts on hand). I usually
  add large pieces since they are kind of cut up by the B/M while knead
  ing. We can keep experimenting with this....let me know if you try it
  and what you add or subtract. Have you ever added raisins, oatmeal or
  any kind of seeds? The B/M gives me the lazy way out, and I wanted to
  see what it would do in it.  Thanks so much for taking precious time
  to post the recipe. P.S. I have some of the beer s/d starter to give
  you when we get together, but the whole wheat starter is GREAT!.

  and what you add or subtract. Have you ever added raisins, oatmeal or
  any kind of seeds? The B/M gives me the lazy way out, and I wanted to
  see what it would do in it.  Thanks so much for taking precious time
  to post the recipe. P.S. I have some of the beer s/d starter to give
  you when we get together, but the whole wheat starter is GREAT!.

      Title: WHOLE-GRAIN BREAKFAST CEREAL
 Categories: Breakfast, Digest
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Whole wheat berries
      1 c  Whole rye berries
      1 c  Whole triticale
      1 c  Whole barley
      1 c  Brown rice
      1 c  Buckwheat groats
      1 c  Millet
      1 c  Sesame seeds
      1 c  Flaxseed
      1 c  Lentils
     10 c  Oat groats
 
  I mix it up, then cook a pot of it by measuring 2 cups of cereal to 5
  cups of water, bringing it to boil, & then letting it sit over night.
  Then I have a bowlful each morning, heated in the microwave until the
  cooked cereal is gone and I need to make more. Or you could do the
  same with a smaller amount, for one serving, say, try 1/4 cup of
  cereal. It's very chewy and satisfying. And of course lots of whole
  grains. Sometimes I just use oatmeal instead of oat groats, since
  they are difficult to find and I like the consistency that oatmeal
  adds. In the book he has a little paragraph about each grain,
  explaining what vitamins/minerals it has & what it's good for.

  I checked the subject list under Asian Cooking, and didn't see any I
  recognized as this soup. I didn't have time to check each one
  individually, so I hope this doesn't duplicate what you already have.
  This is from the "Sunset Oriental Cookbook". Thinly sliced green
  onion, including tops Prepare sesame seeds;place in a 5-6 qt. kettle
  and add ribs, broth, water, soy, sugar, garlic, ginger,pepper, and
  whole onions. Bring to a boil over med. heat;cover, reduce heat, and
  simmer till beef is tender (2 1/2 -3 hrs.) Lift out ribs, and let
  cool. Lift out and discard ginger and onions. Skim and discard fat
  from broth. When ribs are cool, discard bones and fat; then shred
  meat with fingers. Return meat to broth and add daikon. Bring to boil
  over med. high heat;cover,reduce heat,and simmer till daikon is
  tender to > bite (10-15 min.). Add oil. Gently break eggs, one at a
  time, into barely simmering broth;cover and cook just till eggs are
  softly set ( about 2 min.). Ladle soup and eggs into individual
  bowls, and sprinkle sliced onions over top. Makes 3 or 4 servings. I
  hope this helps. I haven't had this for a while, and I'm waiting for
  cool weather. And in Texas, I've got a ways to wait!!!!! Carla in

  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 ts Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
 
  In a glass or ceramic bowl or jar that has been scalded, combine
  flour and yeast, add water and blend well. Cover with plastic wrap
  and pierce with fork to release gases. Place in a warm, draft-free
  location at an even 85F for 18-24 hrs; stir several times daily.
  Refrigerate until ready to use. If you have several starters, keep
  whole wheat separate from others to preserve its own distinctive
  flavor. Whole wheat starter does not have as much rising action as
  that made with white flour; you may have to plan longer rising times.
  To replenish, always use whole wheat flour.

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter; or margarine
           -2 oz, 50 g
      1 tb Sunflower oil
      2 ea Onions; thinly sliced
    1/2 ea Red pepper;seeded & thinly
           -sliced
    1/2 ea Yellow pepper; seeded & thin

      3 tb Pansies, purple; *
      2 lg Eggs; or 3 small
    1/2 c  Cheddar or Gruyere cheese
           -shredded, 2 oz 50 g
  1 1/4 c  Milk; 1/2 pint  275 ml
           Sea salt & black pepper
 
  * The Latin name for pansies is Viola x wittrockiana, only use in
  amount specified "This colourful starter makes a great supper or
  lunch dish served with new green peas or a leafy salad. Its bright
  colours make it appealing to both adults and children and it easy to
  make." First make the flan case; sift the flour and salt into a large
  bowl and tip in the bran remaining in the sieve. Chop the margarine
  into the flour with a knife, then gently rub in with your fingertips
  until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Lift your fingers above
  the bowl as you rub to keep the mixture light or aerated (Anne's
  note: I would use a food processor). Add the iced water and mix with
  a knife until you have a firm dough. Lift out the dough, wrap in
  cling film (Saran) and chill in the fridge for 5-10 minutes. Heat the
  oven to 350F/180 C/gas 4. On a lightly floured marble or wooden
  surface, roll out the dough thinly into a circle large enough to line
  a 8-0/20-24 cm flan dish. Grease the dish and line it with the dough.
  Set aside. To make the filling, heat the butter and oil in a shallow
  pan, put in the onions and peppers and sweat (cook) gently until the
  vegetables are soft but not coloured. Add the pansies. Whisk the eggs
  and stir in the grated cheese and milk. Season to taste. Pour the
  onion and pepper mixture into the egg mixture and stir well. Pour
  into the prepared flan case. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes.,
  rising the heat a little if necessary, until the filling is nicely
  puffed up and the pastry is beginning to brown. Serve hot or cold.

      Title: WHOLESOME BRISKET WITH ROASTED VEGETABLES
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
    4 3/4 lb to 5 lb brisket, trimmed but
  :          not completely
        1    head garlic, top 1/4-inch
  :          sliced off
        4 ts olive oil
        3 sm onions (about 12 ounces
  :          total),
  :          peeled, root end kept intact
  :          cut in half lengthwise,
  :       ea half cut into 3 wedges
        1 lb carrots, trimmed, peeled,
  :          and cut into 3- to 4-inch
  :          pieces
      1/2 c  water
        2 c  drained and mushed whole
  :          plum tomatoes
  :          plus 1/4 cup reserved
  :          roasting liquid or
  :          one 16-ounce can whole
  :          tomatoes with liqui
        1 sm bay leaf
  :          Kosher salt -- to taste
  :          Freshly ground black pepper
  :          to taste
  
  Place one rack in the center of the oven and another in the bottom.
  Heat oven to 500 degrees F.
  
  Place brisket, fat side down, in a 14 x12 x 2-inch roasting pan. It's
  
  best not to use a shallow pan for this, or later the juices might run
  
  over and out. Put the garlic in the pan. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of
  the oil. Using your hands, rub oil onto garlic.
  
  Put the onion wedges and carrots into a smaller, 12 x 8 x 1 1/2-inch
  roasting pan. Drizzle with remaining oil. Using your hands, rub oil
  over all the pieces until they are well coated. Arrange onion wedges
  on their sides, so that they touch carrots as little as possible.
  
  Roast vegetables on center rack of oven for 30 minutes. Turn with a
  spatula. Roast 15 minutes more. Roast the brisket simultaneously on
  the bottom rack of the oven for 15 minutes. Turn over so fat side is
  up. Roast 30 minutes more.
  
  Remove both pans from oven. Lower heat to 275 degrees F, leaving the
  door ajar a minute or two to reduce temperature more quickly. Leave
  the brisket and garlic in the large pan and add 1/4 cup of the water.
  The water should bubble up from the heat of the pan; if it does not,
  put pan on the stove over medium-high heat. With a wooden spoon,
  scrape around the brisket to scoop up and remove the brown bits from
  the bottom of pan.
  
  Put the onions and carrots into the brisket pan. Put the smaller pan
  on top of the stove. Add the remaining water and bring contents to a
  boil while scraping the bottom vigorously with a wooden spoon. Pour
  liquid into brisket pan.
  
  Add roasted plum tomatoes and reserved roasting liquid or, if using
  canned tomatoes, stick a small knife into the opened can of tomatoes.
  Run it back and forth through the tomatoes and puree until only small
  pieces remain. Pour contents over vegetables and around brisket. Put
  the bay leaf into the liquid. Cover tightly with foil.
  
  Roast on center rack of oven for 3 1/2 hours. Remove foil, increase
  temperature to 500 degrees F, and roast 15 minutes more or until
  brisket is nicely browned.
  
  Remove. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. With the back of a spoon,
  smush the softened garlic out of each section and into the liquid.
  Throw the empty papers away. Transfer brisket to a platter and cover
  brisket with a tent of foil. Use slotted spoon to transfer vegetables
  to a large serving bowl or plate. Discard the bay leaf. Pour
  remaining liquid into a measuring cup. Let sit long enough for the
  fat to rise to the surface, about 15 minutes. Skim fat off surface.
  
  To serve, cut brisket against the grain into long thin strips.
  Arrange 2 to 3 slices on each plate. Spoon on some of the vegetables,
  and moisten everything with a generous amount of the liquid.

      Title: WHOOPEE PIES
 Categories: Chocolate, Appetizers, Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Solid White Vegetable
           -Shortening
      2 c  Unbleached Flour
    1/2 c  Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
  1 1/2 ts Baking Soda
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Milk
      2 ts Vanilla Extract
           FILLING:
    1/2 c  Butter, Softened (1 Stick)
  7 1/2 oz Marshmallow Creme (1 Jar)
    3/4 c  Confectioners' Sugar
    1/4 c  Solid White Vegetable
           -Shortening
    1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
 
  Yield:  About 20 "Pies"
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease 3 or 4 baking sheets and
  set aside.
  
  TO MAKE THE PIES:
  
  Beat the sugar and shortening in the large bowl of an electric mixer
  until well blended.  Mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a
  medium-sized bowl with a wire whisk until light and thoroughly
  combined. (Using the wire whisk to blend the dry ingredients, in this
  case, makes sifting unnecessary.)  With the electric mixer running on
  low speed, add the flour mixture and milk alternately to the sugar
  mixture, starting and ending with the flour mixture, beating well
  after each addition. beat in the vanilla.
  
  Drop the batter by heaping measuring TBLS. 2 inches apart on the
  prepared baking sheets.  (The little cakes will be about 2 1/2 inches
  in diameter after baking) You should have about 40 cakes. Bake for 15
  minutes or until cakes spring back when touched lightly. Remove to
  wire racks to cool.
  
  TO MAKE THE FILLING:
  
  In a large bowl, combine the butter, marshmallow creme, sugar,
  shortening and vanilla.  Beat for 2 minutes, using an electric mixer
  set on high speed, until light and fluffy.
  
  ASSEMBLY:
  
  Place about 1 TBS of filling on the flat sides of half the cakes. Top
  with the remaining cakes and press together so that the filling
  squashes out the sides a little.
  
  NOTE:
  
  Because of all the butter in the filling, these pies should not be
  held at room temperature indefinitely. Pies that are not to be eaten
  soon after baking should be wrapped in plastic film and refrigerated
  or frozen for future use.

      Title: WHY CAN FOODS?
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  Canning can be a safe and economical way to preserve quality food at
  home. Disregarding the value of your labor, canning homegrown food
  may save you half the cost of buying commercially canned food.
  Canning favorite and special products to be enjoyed by family and
  friends is a fulfilling experience and a source of pride for many
  people.
  
  Many vegetables begin losing some of their vitamins when harvested.
  Nearly half the vitamins may be lost within a few days unless the
  fresh produce is cooled or preserved. Within 1 to 2 weeks, even
  refrigerated produce loses half or more of some of its vitamins. The
  heating process during canning destroys from one-third to one-half of
  vitamins A and C, thiamin, and riboflavin. Once canned, additional
  losses of these sensitive vitamins are from 5 to 20 percent each
  year. The amounts of other vitamins, however, are only slightly lower
  in canned compared with fresh food. If vegetables are handled
  properly and canned promptly after harvest, they can be more
  nutritious than fresh produce sold in local stores.
  
  The advantages of home canning are lost when you start with poor
  quality fresh foods; when jars fail to seal properly; when food
  spoils; and when flavors, texture, color and nutrients deteriorate
  using prolonged storage.

      Title: WIENER KRINGLE
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 pk Active dry yeast
    3/4 c  Warm (not hot) water
      2    Eggs
      7 tb Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
  1 1/4 c  Milk
      6 c  Sifted enriched all purpose
           -flour
    3/4 lb Butter or margarine
  1 1/2 c  Jam or seedless raisins or
           -3 c. almond paste
    3/4 c  Crushed lump sugar
    3/4 c  Chopped nuts
 
  Sprinkle dry yeast on water; stir until dissolved.  In large bowl,
  beat eggs with hand beater until foamy; set aside 2 Tbsp.; Add sugar
  to eggs; beat until thick. Stir in yeast, cardamom and milk. Then
  stir in 5 c. flour, mixing with hands, if necessary.  On large
  floured board, roll out dough into 18 X 12 inch rectangle. With knife
  or cheesecutter, cut 1/4 lb of butter into thin slices; place on half
  of dough; fold other half on top. Using palms of hands, firmly press
  down on dough, turning it on board as necessary, until another
  rectangle is formed. Repeat with second 1/4 lb of butter; then repeat
  again with last 1/4 lb of butter. Now, sprinkling board and hands
  with flour as necessary, continue folding and pressing dough with
  hands until all the butter has been worked in and no specks of yellow
  are showing.  (This is easier if, every now and then, you roll out
  dough with rolling pin into a large rectangle; fold in quarters; and
  press out again.)
  
  Now divide dough into thirds. Gently pull one third into a rope about
  34 inches long.  On greased 17 X 14 inch cookie sheet, place rope in
  circle, with ends 2 inches apart. With palm of hand, flatten dough to
  form collar about 4 inches wide.  Down center of collar, spoon 1/2 c.
  jam or raisins, or spread 1 c. almond paste. Pull one edge of collar
  up over jam; moisten with water; pull other edge up on top; press
  gently to seal.
  
  Carefully form collar into pretzel shape.  Make 2 more "pretzels"
  with rest of dough.  Brush top of each with reserved beaten egg;
  sprinkle with crushed sugar and nuts; press into dough. Let rise in
  warm place (80 to 85 F) until double in bulk.  Bake at 425 F 20
  minutes, or until brown. Brush with melted butter; cool on cake rack.

  Trim all fat from veal. Pound each slice as thin as possible (about
  1/8 inch thick). Make small vertical cuts all around the edges of the
  veal. Salt each slice. Dip first into a soup plate containing flour,
  and shake off excess; next into a soup plate of beaten egg; finally
  into a soup plate containing dried bread crumbs, pressing crumbs well
  in with the palm of your hand, then shaking off excess. Fry in deep
  fat, half olive oil, half melted lard, so hot that it smokes, for 2
  to 3 minutes on each side, or until heat is right when the breading
  ripples golden brown. Schnitzel is done and tender when a fork goes
  right through the meat. Serve garnished with lemon wedges and
  potatoes or salad as a side dish.

    1/8 ts Thyme
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/8 ts Allspice
      1 tb Finely minced green onions

MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Coganc
    1/2 c  Very finely minced onions
      2 tb Butter
    3/4 lb Lean pork and 3/4 lb lean
           Veal finely ground together
      2    Eggs lightly beaten
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Thyme
      1 cl Garlic crushed
      1 lb Bacon blanched to remove
           Salt
      1    Bay leaf
 
  First, marinate the strips of game. In a non-reactive bowl, mix
  together the marinade ingredients, the cognac, salt and pepper,
  thyme, allspice and green onions. Add strips of game and marinate
  while preparing stuffing. For stuffing, cook onions slowly in the
  butter until tender. Scrape into large mixing bowl. Pour cognac into
  same skillet and boil until reduced by half, scraping bottom of
  skillet to loosen any pan drippings. Scrape into bowl with onions.
  Add pork and veal, beaten eggs, salt, pepper, allspice, thyme and
  garlic. Beat vigorously with wooden spoon until thoroughly blended.
  To assemble pate, line bottom and sides of laof pan with blanched
  bacon (to blanch plunge bacon into boiling water, remove immediately
  and drain briefly under cold running water), reserving a few strips
  for top of pate. Drain game strips, reserving marinade. Beat marinade
  into stuffing. Divide stuffing into three parts. Dip hands in cold
  water and arrange first third of the stuffing in bottom of loaf pan.
  COver with half the strips of game. Repeat layers, another third of
  stuffing and remaining half of game strips. SPread remaining thrid of
  stuffing on top. Place bay leaf on top and cover with remaining
  blanched bacon. COver top of pan with aluminum foil and set in larger
  pan of boiling water (water should come about halfway up the outside
  of loaf pan). Bake in oven preheated to 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.
  Remove loaf pan from water and place another loaf pan (preferably
  glass so it's heavy enough to weight down the pate) on top of
  foil-wrapped pate. Cool pate at room temperature several hours or
  overnight. Chill, still weighted. Serve in slices with crackers.NOTE:
  A "pinch" is about 1/8 ts.

  liquid and cook until almost completely reduced again, 5 to 7
  minutes. Remove from heat, transfer to a small bowl, and set aside.
  
  4. Rinse skillet, dry, and return to high heat. Starting with the
  firmest, cook mushrooms in 2 batches using a T of butter and oil for

  medium. Cook, stirring often, until mushrooms are nearly tender, 5 to
  10 minutes. Keep in a large bowl while second batch cooks.
  
  5. Return all the mushrooms to the pan. Add porcini and parsley
  mixtures. Cook over medium-high heat until garlic gives off an aroma,
  2 to 3 minutes. Adjust seasonings and remove pan from heat.
  
  6. Transfer mushrooms to a bowl and serve with crostini, or spoon a
  bit of the mushroom mixture on each slice of crostini and arrange on
  a plate.

  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. To prepare ancho paste, wash, dry,
  stem, and seed chiles. Place in a single layer on a baking sheet and
  roast for 1 minute. Put in a bowl and cover with warm water for 30
  min. to rehydrate. Strain (reserve liquid) and puree' in a blender
  with enough of the liquid to form a thick paste.
  
  In a skillet, bring 5 tbsp ancho paste, cream, and garlic to a boil
  and simmer for 2 min. Transfer to a blender and puree'. Add lime
  juice and salt to taste. Strain and set aside.
  
  Heat butter in a large skillet and saute' onion and mushrooms for 2
  minutes over medium heat, until onion is translucent and mushrooms
  are soft. Add avocado, cheese, cilantro, and tomato, and just heat
  through. Add 2 tbsp of reserved ancho cream puree' and stir gently.
  Add salt to taste and simmer 3 min.
  
  Heat remaining reserved ancho cream puree' in a skillet until
  simmering. Soak tortillas one at a time in puree' for 15 sec. to
  soften and use tongs to place on a baking sheet. Spread mushroom
  mixture evenly down the middle of tortillas. Roll up tortillas, and
  using a metal spatula, place on plates, seam side down. To reheat,
  cover baking sheet with foil and place in a 350 degree oven for 10
  min. Please note the recent questions answered by this recipe:
  
  1. Rehydrate chiles in WARM water, not hot, cold, or vodka.
  
  2. Warm tortillas in sauce, not oil.
  
  3. Place tortillas seam side down.

      Title: WILD MUSHROOM RISOTTO
 Categories: Italian, Vegetables
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      3 tb Unsalted butter
      4 oz Shiitake mushrooms;
           - (or other wild mushrooms),
           -  stems removed, sliced
      4 oz White mushrooms
           - stems removed, sliced
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      1 tb Oil
    1/3 c  Finely minced onion
  1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
    1/2 c  Dry white wine or broth
      5 c  Broth
    1/4 c  Mascarpone cheese
           -=OR=- Whipping cream
           -(or substitute skim milk)
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      1 tb Chopped parsley
 
  You can substitute dried wild mushrooms for the shiitake. Just soak
  them for 15-to-20 minutes beforehand (and be sure to add the strained
  soaking liquid to the stock). HEAT BUTTER in small skillet over
  moderate heat. When it begins to foam, add mushrooms and cook for
  3-to-5 minutes, until soft. Add salt and pepper to taste. Turn off
  heat and set aside. Bring the broth to a steady simmer in a saucepan
  on top of the stove. Heat butter and oil in heavy 4-quart casserole
  over moderate heat. Add onion, saute for 1-to-2 minutes, until it
  begins to soften, being careful not to brown. Add rice to
  butter-oil-onion mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir 1 minute, making
  sure all grains are well coated. Add wine and stir until completely
  absorbed. Add simmering broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring
  frequently. Wait until each addition is almost completely absorbed
  (approximately 2 minutes) before adding next 1/2 cup, reserving 1/4
  cup to add at the end. Stir often. After approximately 18 minutes
  (rice should be tender and firm), add 1/4 cup broth, mushrooms,
  Mascarpone and Parmesan cheeses and stir vigorously so cheeses melt.
  Sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately.

      Title: WILD MUSHROOM RISOTTO  (FINE COOKING)
 Categories: Italian, Rice
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      3 c  Chicken stock (more if
           -needed); * see note
      1 oz Dried porcini mushrooms; see
           - directions
      4 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Arborio rice, about 2 cups
      2 c  Assorted fresh wild
           -mushrooms; clean, trim, coa
    2/3 c  Dry white wine
           Salt to taste
    1/4    Flat-leaf parsley; chopped
      2 tb Parmigiano-reggiano; freshly
           - grated
 
  Soak dried porcini for 30 minutes in 1 cup warm water.  Drain porcini,
  strain soaking liquid, and reserve.  Chop porcini.
  
  Heat the chicken stock along with the reserved strained porcini
  soaking liquid; lower the heat to a simmer.  In a medium, heavy gauge
  saucepan over medium high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter.
  Stir in the rice, toasting just until it starts to sizzle and pop,
  about 1 minute.  It should not color.  Stir the porcini and the fresh
  mushrooms into the rice. Stir in the wine.  When almost all the
  liquid has disappeared, after about 2 minutes, add just enough hot
  stock to cover the rice. Lower the heat to maintain a vigorous
  simmer; stir occasionally.  When the stock is almost gone, add enough
  to cover the rice, along with a pinch of salt.  Check on the risotto
  every 3 or 4 minutes, giving it an occasional stir to make sure it
  isn't sticking to the bottom of the pan, and adding just enough stock
  to cover the rice when the liquid has almost disappeared.  Continue
  this way until the rice is just al dente, about 20 minutes total
  cooking time. Bite into a grain; you should see a white pin-dot in
  the center.  Take the risotto off the heat.  Add the remaining 2
  tablespoons butter; stir vigorously for a few seconds.  Add the
  parsley, cheese, and more salt if needed.  The risotto should be
  moist and creamy, not runny.  Stir in more stock to loosen the
  risotto if you like.  Serve immediately.
  
  * Note:  For a very intense mushroom flavor, use mushroom liquor
  instead of chicken stock; simmer 2 ounces dried porcini in 5 cups of
  water for 5 minutes; let sit 30 minutes off the heat and strain,
  reserving the mushrooms.

      Title: WILD MUSHROOM SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Meats, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 oz Dried mushrooms
     12 oz Assorted fresh mushrooms
           - (chanterelle, cultivated,
           - shiitake, oyster)
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      1 tb Finely minced garlic
      1 tb Finely minced shallots
           -=OR=- Onions
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Sherry or Madeira
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
 
  This sauce has an intensely woodsy flavor that would be good on pasta,
  roast chicken or pork. TO RECONSTITUTE DRIED MUSHROOMS, place them in
  a bowl and cover with 3 cups of warm water. Soak for at least 2 hours
  or up to 8. When mushrooms are soft, drain and reserve water and
  squeeze out as much water as you can from the mushrooms. Pour the
  mushroom water through a double layer of cheesecloth or a cloth towel
  to remove any sand that may have been lurking in the mushrooms.
  Reserve 1 cup of liquid for this recipe. (Pour the remaining mushroom
  water into a plastic container or airtight bag, label and freeze for
  up to a year to use in soups and sauces.) Wash the fresh mushrooms
  and pat dry. (Slice chanterelles and cultivated mushrooms, trim and
  discard the stems of shiitake mushrooms, and trim and discard root
  tips of oyster mushrooms.) Melt the butter in a medium skillet over
  medium heat and add the reconstituted dried mushrooms, garlic,
  shallots and salt. Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes. Add the fresh
  mushrooms and continue to cook another 10 minutes. Add the reserved
  mushroom water and sherry. Increase the heat to high and cook until
  the liquid reduces by about 2/3. Add the cream and cook until the
  liquid reduces to a saucelike consistency and is thick enough to coat
  a spoon.

           -large pieces)
      3 md Potatoes
      2 sm Carrots
      1 md Onion
      1 sm Shallot
      2 lb Wild or cultivated fresh

      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Minced fresh flat-leaf
           -parsley
           Freshly-ground black pepper
 
  PREPARATION:  Put dried porcini mushrooms in a small bowl with 1/2
  cup hot water.  Let stand until softened, about 20 minutes. Remove

  1 3/4 c  Water
      1    Box Sure-Jell
 
  Suli Potter and Karen Frerichs of Berkeley and San Francisco,
  respectively, are devotees of the wild plums that abound in Berkeley.
  They have come up with lovely clear jelly made from the plums. The
  flavor is just slightly tart, a nice change from too- sweet jellies.
  Potter advises, "Follow the Sure-Jell instructions with mindless
  fidelity. "
  
  Leaving skins intact, cook plums in the water for 5 to 10 minutes.
  Crush plums as they cook with the back of a wooden spoon. Squeeze
  through a jelly bag and follow the Sure-Jell instructions. You will
  have 6 3/4 CUPS juice.

      Title: WILD RICE & RED ONION SOUP
 Categories: Soup, Rice, Onion
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Raw wild rice
      1 ts Salt
      2 lb Red onions
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Sugar
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      1 ts Crushed dried rosemary
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      1 qt Chicken stock
      1 c  Parmesan cheese; freshly
           -grated
 
  1.   Wash the wild rice by placing it in a 1-quart saucepan filled
  with water.  Stir the rice around in the water until the liquid
  darkens. Drain the rice through a sieve.
     Rinse the saucepan and add 1-1/2 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon of
  the salt.  Bring to a boil and add the rice. Turn the heat to low,
  cover the saucepan, and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes until the liquid
  has evaporated.
     Check the rice several times while it is cooking and fluff it with
  a fork.  Set aside, still covered, until it is time to add it to the
  soup.
  
  2.   Peel and slice the onions.  They should be about 1/8" thick.
  Slice them on the bias to avoid rings.
  
  3.  In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil.  Add the onions and the
  remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Toss to coat the onions with the oil.
  Cover, and over low heat, "sweat" the onions for 20 minutes. During
  this time, the onions will become limp and give off their liquid.
  
  4.  Remove the cover and turn the heat to medium.  Add the sugar,
  butter, rosemary, and black pepper.  Toss to mix. Continue cooking
  uncovered foir another 15 minutes or so until the onions are very
  lightly browned. Begin warming your soup plates.
  
  5.  Increase the heat and add the wine.  Bring to a full simmer and
  cook until the wine has almost evaporated. Stir to make sure that the
  onions do not burn.
  
  6.  Add the chicken stock, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Just
  before serving, add the wild rice and cook only long enough to heat
  the rice.
  
  7.  Serve the soup in heated soup plates, sprinkling each serving
  with 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese.
