 Categories: Canning, Preserves, Relishes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Eggs
           Canned beets
           White vinegar
           Pickling spices
 
  Boil the eggs by putting them in a pan and covering them with ice cold
  water.  Put the pan on the stove and bring it to a boil. Remove the
  pan from the heat and cover it. Leave it alone for about 20 minutes.
  At that time, drain the hot water and refill the pan with ice cold
  water to stop the cooking and make them easy to peel. Peel the eggs.
  Put them in a large jar. Open a can of beets and pour them over the
  eggs. Throw in about a tablespoon of pickling spice (more if you are
  doing a lot of eggs), and fill the jar with white vinegar so that all
  eggs are completely submerged. Cap the jar and put it in the
  refrigerator and let them pickle for at least 2 weeks.  The longer
  you let them pickle, the more intense the color (purple!)...and if
  you leave them long enough, they'll pickle all the way to the yolk.
  These are delicious.

 Categories: Eggs, Pickles
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Beets, small young

MMMMM-----------------------------S----------------------------------
      2 c  Sugar
      2 c  Water
      2 c  Vinegar
      1 ts Cloves
      1 ts Allspice
      1 tb Cinnamon
 
   Select small, young beets.  Wash.  Leave 3 inches of tops on and
  roots. Cook until skins slip easily (about 15 minutes).
   Pack beets into jars within 1/2 inch of top.  Pour boiling liquid
  syrup over beets to within 1/2 inch of top of jar. Process for 30
  minutes in boiling water bath.
   After the beets have had time to "cure" (about 2 months), we then eat
  about 1/2 of the beets out of a quart jar, drop hard- boiled eggs
  into the pickled beet juice, and put into the refrigerator for about
  2 weeks. By then, the beet color will have penetrated into the whites
  of the eggs nearly to the yolk area. Of course, a much simpler way
  would be simply to buy a large jar of pickled beets, eat about 1/2,
  and drop in hard- boiled eggs; then, refrigerate and leave for a
  couple of weeks until the beet juice has penetrated.

           -size), peeled
 
  Here's something that might appeal those of you engaged in the Garlic
  Thread.  It's not for everyone, but if you're a true garlic fan, these
  munchies might be right up your alley. Thai garlic comes in pods that
  are about the same size as Western garlic but the cloves are about
  1/3 to 1/2 the size of ours and there are correspondingly more in a
  head. The plus is that they don't have to be skinned before use. The
  emphasis here is on the sour rather than the sweet.  Quite a taste
  sensation. In a medium saucepan, bring the vinegar, water, sugar and
  salt to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Drop in the
  garlic.  Return to boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat. Cool,
  and fill sterilized, screw-top jars. Store in the refrigerator for at
  least 1 week before eating. Continue to refrigerate, tightly covered,
  between serving.

           Hard boiled eggs
           Really good pickle juice
 
  One of the best uses of pickle juice is to refill the pickle jar with
  peeled hard boiled eggs and let them stay in the pickle juice for as
  long as you can stand to wait. Cauliflower that has been cooked just
  slightly and added hot to the pickle juice is also good.
  
  Pickle juice is also good poured over hot potato chunks before making
  potato salad. Don't throw out Clausen's pickle juice until it's all
  used up!

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Keg holland herring

MMMMM----------------FOR EACH WIDE MOUTH JAR (QUA---------------------
      2 c  Spanish onions coarsely cut
           Divided
    1/2 ts Mustard seed
    1/2 ts Whole black peppercorns
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2    Half bay leaf
           White pepper
 
  Drain brine from keg and clean herring cutting off tail and head if
  necessary. Soak in refrigerator for at least 24 hours in about 3
  gallons of water, soak longer and change water 5-6 times if herring
  are packed in salty brine. This will vary because of varieties of
  herring - salt, schmaltz, matjes and bismark - and they vary as to
  saltiness and firmness. To bone herring, take a sharp, pointed knife
  and slit along the backbone, starting with the head end on your left
  hand side, grasped firmly by your left hand, and traveling the knife
  across the spine, going about an inch down toward the bone until you
  come to the tail end. Bend the tail sharply to break it, then reverse
  the fish and move back along the spine, loosening flesh from bone
  with index finger and thumb. Roll slivers of fillet around pieces of
  dill pickle and fasten with a toothpick, you can make these large or
  smaller, for appetizers. In each jar, place 1 cup onions, the mustard
  seed, peppercorns, salt and bay leaf. Pack in rolmops, the remaining
  1 cup onions, then fill empty spaces around herring with mixture of
  1/2 water, 1/2 vinegar. Place lid on jar and shake from side to side
  to get rid of air bubbles. Remove lid and add more water and vinegar
  mixture to fill completelt. Cover again and refrigerate for 10 days.
  Rolmops must be eaten within 4 weeks, or they get soft.

    1/4 ts Powdered ascorbic acid
 
  Yield: About 2 half-pints
  
  Procedure: The pungency of fresh horseradish fades within 1 to 2
  months, even when refrigerated. Therefore, make only small quantities
  at a time. Wash horseradish roots thoroughly and peel off brown outer
  skin. The peeled roots may be grated in a food processor or cut into
  small cubes and put through a food grinder. Combine ingredients and
  fill into sterile jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Seal jars tightly

  Wash peppers thoroughly.  Remove core, seeds, and stems of large

  peppers may be left whole with stems intact.  Make two small slits in
  whole peppers.
  
  Mix vinegar and water; heat to 150-160F./66-71C. about to the
  simmering point.  Since it is rather volatile, vinegar should NOT
  boil a long time. Pack peppers rather tightly into jars.  Pour hot
  vinegar and water over the peppers to 1/2 inch of jar rim.  If oil is
  desired, add vinegar to only 3/4 inch of jar top.  Add olive oil to
  come 1/2 inch from top. The peppers will be coated with oil when they
  pass through the oil layer as you use them. Add salt to taste, seal,
  and process 15 minutes in simmering (180-185F./82-85C.) Hot Water

      4    Garlic cloves; peeled
           -=OR=- More if you like
      8    Whole allspice

      2 c  Distilled white vinegar
      2 c  Water
      2 ts Salt
      4 tb Olive oil, or as needed
 
  RINSE AND DRAIN THE PEPPERS; trim stems to a stub. Pack the peppers
  into 4 wide-mouthed pint canning jars, dividing them equally. As the
  peppers are packed, scatter among them a share of the seasonings:
  
  In each jar place: 1 clove garlic split; 2 whole allspice; 6
  peppercorns; and a piece of bay leaf.
  
  Combine the vinegar, water and salt in a stainless-steel or enameled
  saucepan and heat the mixture to simmering. Pour the hot solution
  over the peppers, covering them completely and leaving 1 inch of head
  space. Remove any bubbles and add liquid if necessary to maintain
  head space. (If there should be insufficient solution to cover the
  peppers, make more in the same proportions; no harm will be done if a
  few moments are required to do this.) Add enough olive oil to each
  jar to cover the surface of the liquid, about 1 tablespoon. Seal the
  jars with new two-piece canning lids, according to manufacturer's
  directions and process for 15 minutes in a boiling water bath. Cool,
  label and store the jars. The peppers are good to eat after 2 weeks,
  but they will be better after at least a month's rest in the jar.

 Categories: Jams, Jellies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Fresh chiles
           (jalapenos or serranos)
           Carrots
           Cauliflower
           Onions
           Garlic -- (1/4 head per
           Jar)
           Spices in each jar:
      1    Whole bay leaf -- up to 2
           Leaves
      2    Cloves garlic
      2    Whole peppercorns -- up to
      1    Little piece  cinnamon
    1/4 ts Mustard seed
           Salt
           White vinegar
           (1/2 gallon for 8 1-pint
           Jars)
 
  In response to the question how to preserve Jalapenos (or any other
  chile). The following is the recipe I obtained originally from my
  cooking class in high school in Mexico, but I made some modifications
  because the chiles were allways too cooked. As to how tro dry chiles,
  that is a question that can be answered only by experimenting, since
  as a mexican I am use to find any kind of chiles any time in the
  market very cheap, and I would think most of the mexicans wouldn't
  know how to dry them.... Any way, I have a very good recipe for
  chipotles (dry jalapenos) once I am able to understand how this
  system works... Please note that I don't give the exact amounts
  because they would vary depending on what you want to get, but keep
  in mind that the important thing always would be the spices.
  
  Slice the carrots in rounds. Brake the coliflower in small pieces and
  cut the onions in chunks. I cut garlics in such a way that the teeth?
  are in halfs. I like to use entire chiles but I always punch them
  with a toothpick, so the flavor comes out. If you want you can slice
  them in longitudinal cuts, which is the traditional way. I heat a
  little bit of oil (like 3 or 4 tablespoons) and place all the
  vegetables at the same time and mix everything until all the
  vegetables are covered with a thin layer of oil. Then I fill the jars
  with the vegetables (the jars by then already have the spices and
  salt). Apart, I heat the vinegar and when it is boiling I pour it
  over the vegetables.
  
  I close the jars (following the traditional preserving instructions)
  and let them boil closed for 15 minutes. I let stand the pickles for
  at least a week.  Before coming to the states I preserved in this way
  like 5 jars with only fresh  "piquin chiles" and I have been using
  them for the last year, by adding here the vegetables, this works
  wonderful, because we have had very flavorful picles for long time. I
  hope you enjoy this recipe.

      Title: PICKLED JALEPENOS
 Categories: Pickles, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Clove garlic
      1    Sprig Mexican Oregano
           Vinegar
           Jalapeno Peppers
 
  Sterilize pint or half pint canning jars.  Into each jar, place a
  clove of garlic (optional), and a sprig of Mexican oregano (also
  optional, but highly recommended).
  
  Pack the washed peppers into the jars.  For a hotter product, prick
  each pepper a couple of times with a fork (I don't know why, but it
  seems to work).
  
  Fill the jars with boiling vinegar to cover the peppers well. Cap. My
  grandmother never processed these, just stuck them on the shelf for a
  couple of months to marinate. On the rare occasions when I've made
  'em, I keep the jars under refrigeration, just to be sure.
  
  Please note I am NOT a canning/preserving expert -- have done VERY
  little of this (got my fill of it as a kid). I've only made these a
  couple of times as an adult, and they turned out fine, but surely
  there are more expert opinions out there....

      Title: PICKLED OKRA - MARTHA STEWART LIVING
 Categories: Pantry, Soup/stews, Pickles
      Yield: 8 Pints
 
      2 lb Tender okra
      1 qt White vinegar
      6 tb Kosher salt
     16 sm Cloves garlic, peeled
      8 sm Fresh hot red peppers, such
           -as New Mexican chile or
           -Mirasol
      1    Bunch fresh dill (about 24
           -sprigs)
    1/2 c  Yellow mustard seeds
 
  1. Rinse okra and cut away any bruises or bad spots. Trim stem ends
  of okra but do not remove caps entirely.
  
  2. Wash 8 one-pint canning jars, lids, and screw bands with hot, soapy
  water and rinse well. Place jars upright on a wire rack in the bottom
  of a large pot. Fill pot with hot water until jars are submerged by 1
  to 2 inches, and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes. Turn off heat,
  leaving jars in water. Sterilize lids according to manufacturer's
  instructions.
  
  3. Meanwhile, bring the vinegar, 3 C water, and the salt to a boil in
  a large pot.
  
  4. Using stainless-steel tongs, remove jars from water and set on a
  layer of clean towels. Evenly divide garlic, peppers, dill sprigs,
  and mustard seeds among jars. Pack tightly with okra, alternating
  direction of caps. Leave 3/4 inch of space beneath the rim of the
  jar. Pour hot liquid over okra, covering it by 1/4 inch and leaving
  1/2 inch of space beneath the rim. Slide a clean plastic chopstick or
  wooden skewer along the inside of each jar to release any air
  bubbles. Wipe mouth of jar with a clean, damp cloth. Place hot lid on
  jar; turn screw band firmly without forcing.
  
  5. Place a wire rack in the bottom of a large pot and fill partway
  with hot water. Using a jar lifter, place the jars on the rack. Add
  enough hot water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil. Boil for
  10 minutes. Remove jars from water bath; let stand on clean dish
  towels for 24 hours. Check cool jars for the slight indentation in
  the lids that indicates a vacuum seal. Jars that do not seal properlY
  or that leak during processing should be stored in the refrigerator
  and the pickles consumed within a week. Allow sealed pickles to
  mellow in a cool dry place for 6 to 8 weeks before serving. Store
  opened jars in the refrigerator.

      Title: PICKLED SALMON ("EMEL STYLE" - PAT & JOE)
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Ingredients for Brine:
      2 c  Cider vinegar
    1/2 c  Water
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Pickling spice
 
  SALTING: Cut salmon pieces approx. 4" wide. Put salmon pieces in a
  crock or suitable container skin side down, layering salt and fish.
  Be sure to use plenty of salt. Use a weighted dish on top of the fish
  to keep the salmon submerged in the brine; thirty days minimum for
  curing. Keep watch for oil scum on surface - remove scum with paper
  towels. Occasionally a mold will occur. If this happens it will be
  necessary to rebrine. Dump out all of the old brine and clean off
  fish. Rebrine by using at least a quart of rock salt to a gallon of
  water. (Don't spare the salt. Be sure the brine covers all of the
  fish.) During the above operation the fish can be kept at outside
  temperature ~ cool place - not necessary to refrigerate. The fish in
  this state can be kept for several months. FRESHENING: Put the fish
  in a container of fresh cold water. Rinse thoroughly two or three
  times a day for 2 days, or until salty taste is right for you. Keep
  refrigerated. Skin the fish and cut into the size pieces you prefer
  for eating. Remove the bones; fish is now ready for the pickling
  process. PICKLING: Make enough brine to cover fish, using above
  ratios. Bring brine ingredients to a boil until sugar is dissolved.
  Set aside to cool. Layer salmon and sliced onions in a container. (If
  you like pickled onions use plenty of them!) Pour cold brine over
  fish until covered completely. Let stand for at least a couple of
  days and then fish can be eaten. Note: You can put the fish in a
  smaller container, not necessary to refrigerate. We use 1 gallon
  containers when we pour pickling mixture on the fish. Then after a
  couple of weeks we put the fish into pint jars. NOTES

      Title: PICKLED SHALLOTS
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    3/4 c  Red wine vinegar *
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
      1    Bay leaf, bruised
      3    Or 4 sprigs fresh thyme,
           -bruised
    3/4 lb Fresh shallots, peeled and
           -thinly sliced **
 
  * (more or less depending upon strength) ** (do not use shallots that
  are withered or sprouting)
  
  From Catherine Brandel. These shallots turn a pretty rosy pink from
  the red wine vinegar. They're crunchy because they are not allowed to
  cook, simply to soak up the sweet-sour solution. The solution should
  not be pickley. Taste it, the amount of water and sugar depends on
  strength of your vinegar.
  
  Combine all ingredients except the shallots and bring to a boil.
  
  Put the shallots in a clean, dry jar and cover with the sweet-sour
  solution. Let cool cover, and store in the refrigerator. These will
  keep 2 weeks or more.
  
  Uses: Add to salads, or meat dishes, or simply nibble them whenever
  you feel like it.
  
  Makes about 1 pint.

     30    Whole Head/young garlic
      2 c  Vinegar
      2 c  Soy Sauce
    2/3 c  Sugar
 
  1. Select young garlic heads with no sprouts. Remove roots and stems,
  wash, and peel off the outside skin. Place in bowl or jar and pour in
  the vinegar. Allow to stand for 4 or 5 days,, turning the heads
  occasionally. 2. When the garlic has lost its harsh taste, drain off
  the vinegar. 3. Boil the soy sauce with the sugar for a few minutes,
  and let cool. Pour the cooled soy sauce over the garlic, seal the jar
  and let it sit for at least 2 months. 4. To serve, slice across the
  heads. Notes: 1. Pickled garlic can be made only in early spring when
  soft, young heads are available. 2. It is very important to let the
  boiled soy sauce cool before combining with the garlic. Cooling
  prevents the garlic from going bad. 3. Garlic prepared this way loses
  all of its characteristic strong odor.

      1    Beef Tongue NOTE!!
 
  PICKLED TONGUE
  
  This is a favorite dish of my family's, especially on holidays like
  Easter and Christmas. Most people cringe at the idea of eating a
  cow's tongue, but actually the meat is very tender, and even if you
  have to close your eyes and plug your nose to try it, please do. I
  guarantee it won't be what you expect!
  
  3C. Red Wine Vinegar                      Make sure to use glass 1 2
  Bulbs Garlic
                          bowls and pans when cooking 1 1/2C. Virgin
  Olive Oil                  the tongue, as metal will 1/4C. Parsley
  (dried or fresh)
  :         change the flavor of the 3/4T. Sweet Basil meat, leaving it
  tasting 1/2T. Rosemary metallic. Salt and Pepper to taste
  
  *Directions*
  
  1. Place tongue in glass saucepan with enough water to cover it.
  
  2. Bring water to boil slowly over a medium heat and continue boiling
  for approx. 45 min.- hour.
  
  3. While the tongue is boiling, prepare the marinade in a glass bowl.
  
  4. In bowl, combine the olive oil and red wine vinegar. Use a garlic
  press to crush the cloves, or you can crush them with the flat side
  of a knife.
  
  rest of the herbs and spices.
  
  6. When the tongue has cooled enough to handle, peel by slicing
  thinly with a sharp paring knife, removing all the taste buds and the
  fat at the base of the tongue. Then proceed in slicing the tongue
  widthwise.
  
  lid, and layer with the marinade.
  
  8. Put the mixture in the fridge with the lid on and allow it to
  remain there, unopened for at least 4 days.
  
  9. When you are ready to serve the tongue, remove it from the fridge
  an hour before, as this dish is best at room temp.

      Title: PICKLED WATERMELON RIND - MARTHA STEWART LIVI
 Categories: Pantry, Soup/stews, Pickles
      Yield: 7 Pints
 
      1 lg Watermelon (about 25 lb)
      2 tb Kosher salt
      3 c  Sugar
      2 c  Cider vinegar
    1/2    Inch length of fresh
           -ginger, peeled
    1/2 ts Ground mace
      2 sm Cinnamon sticks
      1    Lemon, thinly sliced
 
  1. Cut watermelon in half; remove flesh and seeds. Using a metal
  spoon, scrape rind to remove all traces of pink. Cut rind crosswise
  into 1-inch-wide strips. Using a vegetable peeler or a small sharp
  knife, peel the green skin from the rind. Cut away any bruises or bad
  spots. Cut rind into 2-inch lengths.
  
  2. In a large nonreactive bowl, combine salt and 1 gallon cold water.
  Add rind; let soak in brine overnight. Rinse rind 2 or 3 times in
  fresh cold water and drain well.
  
  3. Combine sugar and vinegar in a large nonreactive pot and heat until
  sugar is dissolved. Fold an 8-by-16-inch piece of cheesecloth in half
  to make a square; rinse and squeeze dry. Place, ginger, spices and
  lemon on the cheesecloth. Tie cloth dosed with one end of a 12-inch
  piece of cotton string. Tie a loop in the other end and slip it over
  the handle of a wooden spoon. Suspend spice bag in the vinegar syrup
  by placing the spoon across the top of the pot. Add the rind and
  return to a boil. Reduce heat, simmer for 30 minutes, and let sit
  overnight. Discard spice bag.
  
  4. Wash 7 one-pint canning jars, lids, and screw bands with hot, soapy
  water and rinse well. Place jars upright on wire rack in the bottom
  of a large pot. Fill pot with hot water until jars are submerged by 1
  to 2 inches, and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes. Turn off heat,
  leaving jars in water. Sterilize lids according to manufacturers
  instructions.
  
  5. Using stainless-steel tongs, remove jars from water and place on a
  layer of clean towels. With a slotted spoon, transfer rind to jars,
  leaving 3/4 inch of space beneath the rim. Pour hot syrup over rind,
  covering it by 1/4 inch and leaving 1/2 inch of space beneath the
  rim. Slide a clean plastic chopstick or wooden skewer along inside of
  each jar to release any air bubbles. Wipe mouth of jar with a clean,
  damp cloth. Place hot lid on jar, turn screw band tightly without
  forcing.
  
  6. Place a wire rack in the bottom of a large pot and fill part way
  with hot water. Using a jar lifter, place jars upright on rack. Add
  enough hot water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil. Boil for
  10 minutes. Remove jars from water bath; let stand on clean dish
  towels for 24 hours. Check cool jars for the slight indentation in
  the lids that indicates a vacuum seal. Jars that do not seal properly
  or that leak during processing should be stored in the refrigerator
  and pickles con- sumed within a week. Allow sealed pickles to mellow
  in a cool, dry place for 2 to 3 weeks. Store opened jars in the
  refrigerator.

      Title: PICKLING & RELISH POINTERS
 Categories: Inform, Canfood, Pickling, Typed
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------PICKLES AND RELISHES-------------------------
 
  Pickles, relishes, and chutneys are vegetables prepared with brine
  (salt and water) or vinegar and some sugar and spices. The vinegar
  acts as a preservative, keeping any spoilage organisms from growing.
  Sealing pickled foods in jars and processing in a boiling water bath
  helps keep them fresh, crisp, and free from mold.
  
  Whole, sliced, or chunked vegetables cooked in vinegar or a vinegar
  sugar syrup, can become pickles. Chopped or ground combinations
  cooked with vinegar, sugar, and spices become relishes. Chutneys are
  highly spiced fruit and/or vegetable combinations.
  
  The old fashioned dill pickles and sauerkraut are actually fermented
  in brine, rather than cooked in vinegar. The brine, plus the sugar
  from the cucumber or cabbage, promote a special kind of bacterial
  action that, over several days or weeks, changes cucumbers to pickles
  and transforms cabbage to kraut.
  
  PICKLING POINTERS Because certain ingredients are very important for
  proper pickling, you'll need to be aware of some of the following
  pointers.
  
  1. Use produce that is as fresh as possible. Take it from the garden
  to your kitchen and into jars just as rapidly as possible. If you
  can't process the produce immediately, be sure to keep it
  refrigerated. Vegetables should be just barely ripe; they'll keep
  their shape better than if they were fully ripe. Always select
  cucumber varieties that have been created for pickling. The large
  salad cucumbers were developed for salads, not for pickles. Use
  smaller, less pretty cukes, with pale skins, plenty o bumps, and
  black spines. Never use waxed cucumbers. Select evenly shaped and
  sized vegetables for even cooking and better looking pickles.
  
  2. Water is an important pickle ingredient, especially for long brined
  pickles. Soft water is best. Hard water can cloud the brine or
  discolor the pickles. If you don't have soft water, boil hard water
  for 15 minutes, then let it stand overnight. Skim off the scum, then
  carefully dip out what you need so you won't get any sediment from
  the bottom. Then add 1 tablespoon of salt for each gallon; or you cn
  use distilled water if your water is hard.
  
  3. Salt, too, makes a difference. Table salt contains special
  additives to prevent it from caking in your shaker, and these
  materials can cloud brine. Iodized salt can darken brine. use only
  pure, granulated salt, also known as kosher salt, pickling salt, or
  dairy salt. Most supermarkets stock it with canning supplies.
  
  4. Vinegar is a crucial ingredient for many pickle recipes. check the
  label when you shop, and be sure to get a good quality vinegar of
  from 4 to 6 percent acidity. (Sometimes listed as 40 to 60 grain.)
  Weaker vinegar will not pickles foods. use distilled white vinegar
  for light colored pickles, cider vinegar for darker foods or more
  interesting flavor.
  
  5. Sugar can be brown or white granulated, depending on the lightness
  or darkness of food to be pickled. Or, if you wish, use half corn
  syrup or honey and half sugar. Don't use sugar substitutes unless you
  follow their manufacturers' directions.
  
  6. spices must be fresh. Old spices will make your pickles taste
  musty. Most recipes call for whole spices, which give stronger flavor
  and don't color the pickles as much. It is suggested you tie the
  spices in a cheesecloth bag and add them to the kettle during
  cooking, then remove the bag before packing the pickles into jars.
  Some cooks like to leave whole spices in the jars for stronger flavor
  and just for appearance's sake, but loose spices may darken the
  pickles somewhat.
  
  7. Alum, lime, and other ingredients added to crisp or color pickles
  are not necessary, and their use is not recommended. These
  ingredients are often found in old fashioned recipes. Most of the
  newer recipes won't need any of these additives.

      Title: PICKLING OLIVES
 Categories: Greek, Preserves
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  This is the home method of preserving olives when dry salting is not
  convenient.
  
  If green and ripe olives are mixed together, it is necessary to
  separate them since the ripe olives take less time to treat.
  
  1.  Wash olives well and cut 3 slits in each with a very sharp,
  fine-bladed stainless steel knife, or (better still) use a razor
  blade so that the flesh is not bruised.
  
  2.  Put olives into glass jars or crocks and cover with cold water.
  
  3.  Place a small plate on top to keep olives submerged.
  
  4.  Pour water off carefully each day and replace with fresh water,
  without disturbing olives too much -- do this for 3 days for ripe
  olives, 5 for green.
  
  5.  Pour off and measure the last lot of water to acertain amount of
  brine required.
  
  6.  Measure that quantity of fresh, warm water into a pan and dissolve
  enough coarse pickling salt in it so that when an egg is immersed, an
  area about an inch in diameter breaks the surface. Approximate
  quantities of salt and water are as follows:
  
  **      100 g salt to 1 litre water   -OR-
  
  **      4 oz salt to 1 Imperial pint water  -OR-
  
  **      3-1/4 oz salt to 1 U.S. pint water
  
  7.  Bring brine to the boil then cool thoroughly before pouring over
  olives.
  
  8.  Flat 1/2 cup olive oil on top of each jar or crock and seal.
  
  The olives can remain indefinitely, but black olives should be ready
  for eating in 6-8 weeks, green olives in 2-3 months. Olives are ready
  for use when bitterness has gone.
  
  TO PREPARE FOR THE TABLE: ========================= Remove enough
  olives for 1 month's requirements. Drain well and put into a jar.
  Cover with vinegar, add 1-2 cut cloves of garlic and float 1
  tablespoon olive oil on top.  Leave for 1 week before using.

 Categories: Information, Canning, Pies
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  General: The following fruit fillings are excellent and safe
  products. Each canned quart makes one 8-inch to 9-inch pie. The
  filling may be used as toppings on dessert or pastries. "Clear
  Jel(tm)" is a chemically modified corn starch that produces excellent
  sauce consistency even after fillings are canned and baked. Other
  available starches break down when used in these pie fillings,
  causing a runny sauce consistency. Clear Jel(tm) is increasingly
  available among canning and freezing supplies in some stores. If you
  cannot find it, ask your county Extension home economist about its
  availability in your region.
  
  Because the variety of fruit may alter the flavor of the fruit pie,
  it is suggested that you first make a single quart, make a pie with
  it, and serve. Then adjust the sugar and spices in the recipe to suit
  your personal preferences. The amount of lemon juice should not be
  altered, as it aids in controlling the safety and storage stability
  of the fillings.
  
  When using frozen cherries and blueberries, select unsweetened fruit.
  If sugar has been added, rinse it off while fruit is frozen. Thaw
  fruit, then collect, measure, and use juice from fruit to partially
  replace the water specified in the recipe.  Use only 1/4 cup Clear
  Jel(tm) per quart, or 1-3/4 cups for 7 quarts. Use fresh fruit in the
  apple and peach pie fillings.

  Drain piementos. Grate Velveeta cheese into a large bowl. Add
  piementos, black pepper and red pepper to mayonnayse and mix well.
  Add mayonnaise mixture to grated Velveeta cheese and mix well. Let
  sit at room temp for about a half hour Store in refrigerator in a
  sealed jar NOTES: Try it with Velveeta first...  Then substitute if
  you must.. I find that the velveeta gives a better consistency...
  Also, I recommend hand-grating... Food processors tend to liquify.
  Sometimes I substitute 1 tsp ground mustard for the red pepper...
  (Yup, I'm strange...) It's great on crackers or in sandwiches...
  Also a great topping for burgers... And it keeps for -at least- a
  month in the fridge!!!

      Title: PIEROGI
 Categories: Polish, Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Water
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Mound flour on kneading board and make hole in center. Drop eggs into
  hole and cut into flour with a knife. Add salt and water and knead
  until firm. Let rest for 10 minutes covered with a warm bowl. Divide
  dough in halves and roll thin. Cut circles with a large biscuit
  cutter. Place a small mound of filling a little to one side on each
  round of dough. Moisten edge with a little water, fold over and press
  edges firmly together. Be sure they are well sealed to prevent the
  filling from running out. Drop the pierogi into salted boiling water.
  Cook gently for for 3 to 5 minutes. Lift out of water carefully with
  a perforated spoon. The dough has a tendency to dry while you are
  working. A dry dough will not seal completely. We suggest rolling out
  a large circle of dough, placing small mounds of filling far enough
  apart to allow for cutting, and folding the dough over the mounds of
  filling. Then cut with a small biscuit cutter and seal firmly. Never
  crowd or pile pierogi. The uncooked will stick and the cooked will
  lose shape and lightness. Note: Pierogi can be frozen after boiling
  and they keep well. I perfer all my pierogi fried in butter and
  onions and seasoned with salt and pepper. They should be fried on a
  medium low heat till golden brown. VARIETIES OF FILLING CHEESE: 1 cup
  cottage cheese 1 tsp. melted butter 1 egg beaten 3 tbsp sugar 3 tbsp
  currants 1/4 tsp cinnamon cream cheese with melted butter. Add other
  ingredients and mix well. Fill pierogi. Serve with melted butter and
  sour cream. CHEESE: 1 cup dry cottage cheese 1 dash of salt 1 tsp.
  lemon 1 tbsp sugar 1 egg 1 egg yolk Mix ingredients thoroughly. Fill
  pierogi. CABBAGE AND MUSHROOMS: 1 small head cabbage 2 cups mushrooms
  2 tbsp sour cream 1 small onion, chopped fine butter salt and pepper
  Quarter cabbage and cook in salted water for 15 minutes. Drain, cool
  and chop fine. Saute onion in butter, add chopped mushrooms and fry 5
  minutes. Add chopped cabbage and continue to fry until flavors blend.
  Add sour cream and cool. Fill pierogi. SAUERKRAUT: Two cups
  sauerkraut may be substituted for the cabbage. Rinse and chop
  sauerkraut. Proceed as above. MUSHROOMS: 1 cup chopped mushrooms 1
  onion chopped fine salt and pepper 2 egg yolks butter Saute onion in
  butter. Add mushrooms. Season. Remove from fire, add egg yolks and
  stir well. Cool and fill pierogi. Serve with chopped onion browned in
  butter. MUSHROOMS AND MEAT: 1/2 cup cooked beef 1/2 cup chopped
  mushrooms 1 onion chopped fine butter salt and pepper 2 tbsp sour
  cream Run cooked meat through meat grinder. Fry onion in butter until
  transparent, add mushrooms and meat. Season to taste. Add sour cream
  and cool before using. PRUNES: 1 cup cooked prunes 1 tsp lemon juice
  1 tsp sugar Soak prunes overnight. Cook with sugar and lemon juice.
  When cool, remove stones and fill pierogi. Serve with bread crumbs

      4 tb Butter
      4 tb Vegetable oil
      1 c  Onions; finely chopped
      2 tb Flour
     16    Flat anchovy fillets; washed
           -and dried
    1/2 c  Water
 
  Cut the meat into 8 slices of 6x3 inches each and pound them to 1/8"
  thick, between 2 pieces of wax paper with a meat pounder, the flat of
  a cleaver or bottom of a pot. Trim to the above size. Heat 1
  tablespoon of butter with 2 tablespoons oil in a small skillet and
  saut the onions for 5 to 8 minutes or until tender and golden.
  Remove from heat and stir in flour. Return to heat and cook 1 or 2
  minutes. Reserve 2 tablespoons of this roux for the sauce. Sprinkle
  each slice of meat with salt and pepper and spread the remaining roux
  evening over the meat. Lay 2 anchovy fillets on each slice, roll them
  up securely and either tie with a loop of cord at each end or fasten
  with a wooden toothpick inserted through the roll lengthwise. Heat
  the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in a
  heavy 10-12" saut pan over moderate heat. When the foam subsides,
  add the roulades, 4 at a time. Turn them with kitchen tongs to brown

  preparation of the roulades may be done in advance up to this point.
  Preheat the oven to 350øF. Deglaze the pan by pouring in 1/2 cup of
  water and boiling for 1 or 2 minutes, stirring to scrape up any bits
  clinging to the pan. Add the 2 tablespoons of roux that you kept
  aside and cook over medium-high heat for 2 or 3 more minutes,
  stirring briskly, until the sauce has thickened. Pour over the

      Title: PIKE IN GALENTYNE
 Categories: Seafood, Main dish, Medieval
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Middle cut of pike
           Or similar large fish
  1 1/4 c  White wine
      2 tb White wine vinegar
      3    Parsley stalks
           Salt
      3    Slices brown bread
           Crusts removed
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground white pepper
      4 oz Onions, peeled and chopped
           Oil for frying
           Gelatine (optional)
 
  Put the fish in a pan, add the wine, vinegar, parsley stalks and
  enough salted water to cover the fish and poach gently for 15
  minutes. Turn off the heat; if necessary, the fish will finish
  cooking in the liquid as it cools.  Cover the pan and cool to tepid
  before finishing the dish.
  
  Carefully lift the fish out of the pan.  Reserve the cooking liquid.
  Put the bread in a bowl and add enough of the liquid to cover it.
  
  Skin the fish and take out the spine and other bones; pike has a line
  of thin bones through the middle of the body flesh on each side. Cut
  all the flesh into small pieces both to get at them and to make a
  manageable dish.
  
  Strain the remaining cooking liquid into a clean pan. Put 425 ml/15
  fl oz/2 cups of it into an electric blender with the soaked bread,
  cinnamon and pepper; process until smooth. Return the mixture to the
  liquid in the pan. Fry the onions in a little oil until soft, and add
  them to the liquid too. Taste for seasoning, add the pieces of fish
  and re-heat gently to serve.
  
  If you want a cold dish, keep the fish pieces and fried onions aside
  while you measure and taste the liquid, then re-heat it with enough
  gelatine to stiffen it; if you had cooked a whole fish, it would have
  jellied without help.  Add the fish pieces and onions, turn into a
  mould and leave to set in the refrigerator. Auter pike in Galentyne.
  Take browne brede, and stepe it in a quarte of vinegre, and a pece of

 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 oz Plain or unbleached flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 oz Fresh yeast*
      1 ts Sugar
      5 fl Warm water
      1 ts Butter
      5 fl Warm milk
      1    Egg, beaten
 
  *Or 1 1/2 t dried yeast.  -- These are similar to crumpets -- they
  are made with a yeast batter, but cooked without rings. -- Sift the
  flour and salt into a warm bowl. Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in
  the warm water. Melt the butter in the warm milk and beat in the egg.
  Stir the yeast liquid and then the milk mixture into the flour. Mix
  into a smooth batter and beat well. Cover and leave in a warm place
  for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the batter is thick and bubbling. Warm
  the bakestone and grease with a piece of lard on a fork (use a piece
  of fat back if you're short of lard). When a drop of water sputters
  on the bakestone, it's hot enough. Stir the batter, then use a ladle
  or a jug to pour it onto the bakestone in round "puddles|, leaving
  space in between so that the pikelets will be easy to turn. The yeast
  batter will not spread as much as pancake batter. Cook over a
  moderate heat until bubbles break the top surface and the underneath
  is pale gold.  Flip over the pikelets and cook the other side until
  honey-colored.  Keep wach batch warm in a folded cloth in a low oven.
  Serve with butter, honey or preserves, or for a savory dish, with
  cream cheese or grilled bacon, or little sausages. To reheat, crisp
  under the grill.

      Title: PILAF WITH SOUR CHERRIES & LENTILS
 Categories: Grains, Middle east
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 c  Basmati rice (*)
      2    Onions, peeled
           -(thinly sliced)
    1/2 c  Red lentils (*)
      7 oz Sour cherries,
           -or more  (*)
      2 c  Chicken or meat
           -broth (*)
      4 tb Butter, unsalted,
           -or more
           Turmeric, cumin, salt
 
  In a 4-5 quart Dutch oven, melt most of the butter and slowly brown
  the onions.  Add the cleaned lentils and fry a bit; then the same for
  the cleaned rice. Stir constantly, browning the rice without letting
  it stick.
  
  Add the cherries and about 2 1/4 cups liquid made up of cherry liquid,
  stock and water. Add about 1/4 - 1 t turmeric and about 1/4 t ground
  cumin if desired; add necessary salt (depending on the saltiness of
  your broth).
  
  Bring to a boil, stir with a fork, cover tightly, and let cook over
  the very lowest heat for about 20 minutes. Fluff up the rice with a
  fork (never a spoon) and add the remaining butter to the bottom of
  the pot.
  
  Raise the heat slightly for 5-10 mins to form a crust on the bottom
  (with the right technique, this should be possible without this
  step...). Serve, making sure to include a bit of crust in each
  serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pilaf with sour cherries and lentils -- This Pilaf with sour
  cherries and lentils is a Persian-style dish, although I cannot vouch
  for its authenticity. It is rich enough to eat for dinner by itself;
  as a side dish, it might be good with a spiced grilled chicken or a
  lamb stew. It is a composite of recipes from cookbooks and from a
  Iranian Jewish family I know.
  
  *  An excellent side dish is yoghurt, possibly flavored (like the
  Indian raita) with one or more of: fresh chopped herbs (parsley,
  coriander, mint), some salt, some spice (paprika, black pepper, black
  onion seed, or coriander seed), olive oil and lemon juice. Even
  better than yoghurt as a base is strained yoghurt, also called Lebany
  Spread or Lebanee, available commercially in New England from Columbo
  or Eunuch (look in Armenian/Arab/Greek stores).
  
  *  Basmati or Patna rice is a particularly flavorful and long-grained
  rice from India or Pakistan.  Any Indian store and many "natural
  foods" stores carry it. It is well worth the premium price (about
  $1.10 a pound); "Texmati" is apparently the same strain grown in
  Texas, but does not have anything like the same taste. Inspect and
  clean it before using, there are often unhusked grains and
  occasionally pebbles mixed in. Then rinse in two changes of water and
  drain thoroughly. If you cannot get Basmati, use a good-quality
  unconverted long-grain rice (Alma, Carolina, but NOT Uncle Ben's!).
  
  *  Red lentils are about half the diameter of ordinary brown lentils.
  Do not substitute brown lentils, which will probably not cook fast
  enough. Red lentils are available in Indian, Middle Eastern and some
  "natural foods" stores.  They often contain largish pebbles, so
  inspect them carefully. Rinse to get rid of dust, and drain. Red
  lentils are also very good by themselves, simply boiled with a few
  spices and served with butter.
  
  *  Sour cherries (in the Middle East, v/w + i + s/sh + n + e/a/ino:
  Greek Vissino, Slavic and Turkish Vishnea, Arabic Wishna) are
  available fresh for about one week a year. Most sour cherries go into
  cherry syrups, pies and preserves.  Canned sour cherries are quite
  good. You will usually find them in the home pie-making section of
  your market, near the canned blueberries and baker's supplies, or
  with the canned fruits. There are occasional stones. (That is, pits,
  not rocks!) Middle Eastern stores will often have sour cherry
  preserves, which are too sweet for this recipe.
  
  *  Almost any stock or broth will work in this recipe. Chicken or
  lamb is most appropriate, in the latter case, used rather dilute.
  This is one of the few recipes where you can actually get away with
  canned chicken broth, but watch the salt.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30-40 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

           Karen Mintzias
  1 1/2 kg Fresh mussels
           Water
           Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Butter
      1 lg Onion; finely choppped
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 c  Short grain rice
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
           Parsley sprigs, lemon wedges
 
  Serves: 6 Cooking time: 45 minutes
  
  Scrub mussels with a stiff brush, scraping shells with a knife blade
  to clean them thoroughly.  Tug beard towards pointed end to remove.
  Place in a bowl of lukewarm salted water until mussels open. If any
  are open to begin with, tap shell - if mussel does not close, then
  discard it. While mussels are open, run lukewarm water into the bowl
  so that any sand can be expelled from the mussels.  Drain.
  
  Heat oil and butter in a deep pan and add onion.  Fry gently until
  transparent.  Add mussels, cover pan and cook for 5 minutes until
  shells open.  If any do not open, then discard them. Add 3 cups cold
  water, wine, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and pepper to taste.  Cover pan and
  bring to a slow simmer.  Simmer gently for 10 minutes, then remove
  mussels with a slotted spoon.
  
  Wash rice until water runs clear, then add to liquid in pan with the
  parsley.  Bring to the boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat,
  cover pan tightly and cook over low heat for 15 minutes.
  
  While rice is cooking scoop mussels from shells and reserve. Keep 6
  mussels in the shell for garnish. Put shelled mussels on top of rice.
  Place two paper towels over rim of pan and fit lid on firmly. Leave
  on low heat for further 5 minutes, then remove pan to side of stove
  and leave for 10 minutes.
  
  Blend mussels through rice with a fork and pile pilafi in a dish.
  Garnish with reserved mussels, parsley sprigs and lemon wedges.
  
  Note: 1/2 cup tomato puree (not paste) may replace 1/2 cup water for a
  different flavour.

      Title: PILLOW CASE JERKY
 Categories: Beef, Smoker
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 lg Boneless butt roast
           Salt & pepper
 
  Get as large a boneless butt as you can.  Cut the individual muscles
  out of the meat and cut off and discard all the fat and connecting
  tissue. Cut the meat across the grain as thin as possible.  1/16 to
  1/8th of an inch. The thinner the slices, the easier it will be to
  dry. Salt and pepper the meat generously on both sides, using more
  pepper than salt. Lay out the meat strips on a cake or oven rack
  without overlapping them. Set the rack in an insert fireplace
  (smoker) and cook on low heat for 8 to 10 hours, turning every 3 to 4
  hours, until dried.  You can do the same with a dehydrator or oven,
  but it won't turn out as good. After it's done, store in a
  pillowcase. Don't STORE it in plastic, as the meat has to be able to
  breathe, and a paper sack will leave a paper taste.

  From Jeff Murphy:
  
  This is my mother's recipe.
  
  She ground a jar of pimentos first, then maybe half a thing of
  Velveeta (you do all this to taste - you're a cook: make it taste
  good) to push the remaining pimentos through the grinder; added a
  fair amount of mayonnaise, a teaspoon of prepared mustard, salt, and
  lots of pepper. Stirred it up, spread it on a single piece of bread
  folded over (I don't know why that tasted better; maybe it was
  because *she* made it) - although today I would serve it open-faced,
  leave out the salt, and add some green salad olives on top.

      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground marjoram
    1/4 ts Ground thyme
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Sharp cheddar cheese (1-1/2
           -oz)
    1/4 c  Pimiento, finely chopped
      1 pk Dry yeast
      2 tb Warm water (105 to 115
           -degrees)
  3 3/4 c  All-purpose flour (3-1/4 to
           -3-3/4 cups)
      1 tb Butter or margarine, melted
 
  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  Combine first 6 ingredients in a medium saucepan; gradually stir in
  milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is
  thickened and smooth. Remove from heat; add cheese and pimiento,
  stirring until cheese melts. Cool mixture to lukewarm (105 to 115
  degrees).
  
  Dissolve yeast in warm water; add to cooled cheese mixture. Gradually
  add 3 cups flour, beating at medium speed of an electric mixer until
  dough is smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough.
  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth
  and elastic (about 5 to 10 minutes). Place dough in a greased bowl,
  turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85
  degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.
  
  Punch dough down, and shape into a loaf. Place in a greased 9x5x3-inch
  loafpan. Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 1 hour
  or until doubled in bulk.
  
  Brush top with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Bake at 350 degrees for 35
  to 40 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove loaf
  from pan, and cool on a wire rack.
  
  Yields 1 loaf.

      Title: PIMIENTO CHEESE SANDWICHES
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 lb New York sharp cheese
      4 oz Jar pimientos
           Cayenne pepper to taste
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1 ds Hot pepper sauce
           Coarse ground black pepper t
           Mayonnaise
     24    Slices white or whole wheat
 
  Grate cheese on the small side of a hand grater in a large mixing
  bowl. Drain the liquid from the pimientos and mash with a fork. Add
  pimientos to the cheese in the bowl. Add cayenne, worcestershire
  sauce, hot pepper sauce and black pepper to taste. Add enough
  Mayonnaise (about 3 T.) to reach the desired consistency and mix
  thoroughly. Use your hands or a big, wide fork to mix.  The mixture
  will become firmer as it sets in the refrigerator. (You can trim the
  edges of the bread at this point-I don't unless making them for
  finger food.. Spread each slice of bread with mayonnaise on one side.
  Put the cheese filling on 12 slices of bread, then put the other 12
  mayonnaise coated bread slices on top. Slice the sandwiches
  diagonally or into strips.  Be sure to put lots of filling into the
  sandwiches.

      7 oz Can crushed pineapple, very

      2 c  Crushed pecans
    1/4 c  Chopped green pepper
      2 tb Chopped onion
      1 ts Seasoned salt
 
  While cream cheese is softening, drain the pineapple in a sieve. It
  must be very dry or the ball will be hard to work with. Mix cheese
  with dry pineapple, green pepper, onion, seasoned salt and one cup of
  the pecans. Place in the refrigerator, cover with saran wrap
  overnight to allow to harden. With a spatula force the cheese up into
  the shape of a ball. Place the remaining cup of pecans on a sheet of
  waxed paper and roll the ball shape out onto them, rolling and
  shaping the ball as you cover the entire ball with pecans. Place on a
  large platter and surround with half slices of sliced pineapple or
  just crackers. I find this is so pretty, I usually have to start it
  myself. No one wants to cut into it.

   This dish was published by Toronto Star Starweek, Mary McGrath's
  Chef's Showcase in the issue of March 12-19, 1994
  
   The recipe was requested by Al Malinauskas of Thornhill, Ontario who
  writes:
  
   "My wife and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary last summer
  at the Pine Apple Inn & Bakehouse. (149 Main St., Unionville, Ontario
  (416) 940-6639) "The grilled Alberta steak was done to perfection and
  the Burgundy Shallot Sauce with it was simply the best that I have
  ever enjoyed"
  
   Credit for the cooking goes to chef David Watt who apprenticed at
  The Ritz Hotel in London, England, and then came home to work at
  Sansoucci in the Sutton Place Hotel before opening The Pine Apple Inn
  in Unionville in 1991 with James Horner and Allan Bell. They describe
  the style of cooking here as "a mixture of old and new".

   Editor's note: For those of you who wonder what an Aberta steak is, I
  encourage you to substutite a Texas steak if you can't get the Alberta
  version [ real thing
  :-) ]. Both are mighty good snackin'
  
   ps. Happy 25th Anniversary Al, I hope you and your sweetheart have
  another 25 or 50 together.

      Title: PINE FURNITURE CLEANER
 Categories: Household, Better
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------CHEAPER AND BETTER--------------------------
      1 c  Mineral oil
      1 tb Pine oil
    1/4 c  SOFT SOAP
      1 c  Warm water
 
  ** Unlike a simple polish which just shines your fine wood, this
  cleaner will remove some dust residue while returning shine to the
  finish. For heavily soiled furniture or wood, wash first will
  ALL-PURPOSE CLEANER and then follow up with this solution to bring
  back the shine.
  
  Mix mineral and pine oils in a glass or enamel bowl. Stir in the SOFT
  SOAP and warm water, continuing to stir until all ingreds are
  thoroughly mixed. Pour into clean qt size jar or bottle, cap and
  label. Keep out of the reach of children.
  
  To Use: Pour about 1T of the solution onto a soft cloth and then
  polish. Turn the cloth frequently, adding more solution if necessary,
  to clean the wood. Finish by buffing with a clean, dry cloth. Repeat
  the process if the wood is especially soiled, but do not allow the
  wood to become soaked. If you're working with FINE FURNITURE, USE A
  MINIMUM OF CLEANING SOLUTION AND CLEAN WITH GENTLE STROKES.
  
  Note: Never use any cleaning solution made with ammonia to wash your
  furnitrue because the ammonia will dissolve whatever kind of finish
  is on the wood.

   A last minute substitute gave a new twist to an old Amish recipe for
  raisin cookies. The cupboard was bare so leftover pineapple was
  substituted for the raisins. Everyone preferred the pineapple
  version. (Editor's Note: We called these Pineapple Muffins Cookies,
  because they came out big and soft.)
  
   Preheat oven to 350ø.
  
   In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening, sugar and egg. When light
  and fluffy, stir in crushed pineapple with juice.
  
   Sift flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg together and stir into
  batter. When the mixture is well blended, stir in nuts.
  
   Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Bake
  at 350ø for 8-10 minutes. Cool on wire racks.

      Title: PINEAPPLE PUDDING
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 oz Butter (not margarine)
    3/4 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
      1 cn Crushed pineapple
      4    Pieces of bread, cubed,
           -crusts included
 
  Cream room-temp butter and sugar together--this can be done right in
  the casserole dish it will be baked in. Beat in eggs, one at at a
  time. Stir in the crushed pineapple (make sure you drain it very
  well). Fold in the cubed bread--I use white but I guess you can use
  whatever. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 45 minutes--the edges will
  turn golden brown and it will get all bubbly. Serve warm, as a
  sidedish with your meal. It could be used as a dessert, but we
  usually indulge with our main meal)
  
  You can cut down on the amount of butter if you want--I usually only
  use 3/4 of a stick.  Leftovers heat up very well, too. Enjoy!

 Categories: Desserts, Cakes
      Yield: 9 Servings
 
      1 tb Butter, softened
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar, packed
      3 cn Pineapple slices (8oz cans)
           - in unsweetened juice
      9    Maraschino cherries
      1 c  Cake flour
    3/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 c  Thawed frozen egg substitute
           - equivalent to 1 egg
    1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/4 ts Coconut extract
 
     Brush bottom and sides of 9-inch square baking pan with butter.
  Sprinkle brown sugar over bottom of pan.
     Drain pineapple slices reserving 1/2 cup juice. Arrange 9 pineapple
  slices on brown sugar in pan. Place 1 maraschino cherry in center of
  each pineapple slice. Puree 2 pineapple slices. Reserve remaining
  pineapple slice for another use.
     Stir together cake flour, sugar and baking powder in bowl. In
  another container, combine 1/4 cup pureed pineapple, 1/2 cup
  pineapple juice, egg substitute, vanilla and coconut extract. Quickly
  combine liquid ingredients with dry ingredients, stirring just until
  blended.
     Pour batter over pineapple in pan, spreading evenly. Bake at 350
  degrees 20 to 25 minutes or until cake tests done in center and is
  golden brown. Cool about 5 minutes.
     Loosen cake around edges of pan.  Place inverted serving platter
  over cake and turn both upside down. Shake gently, then remove pan.
  Slice into squares and serve warm. Makes 9 servings.
  
  Each serving contains about: 221 calories; 103 mg sodium; 3 mg
  cholesterol; 2 grams fat; 51 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams protein;
  0.3 gram fiber.
  
     When preparing the cake, stir the liquid and dry ingredients
  together just until blended --- overmixing causes toughness. Also
  watch the baking closely. Bake only until the center of the cake
  tests done -- overbaking causes dryness and toughness.
     After baking, let the cake stand a few minutes, then loosen the
  edges with a knife.  Invert the cake into a serving platter to reveal
  the fruit-and-sugar glaze. This cake is best when eaten warm. You may
  want to serve it with nonfat frozen yogurt or a dollop of low-fat
  whipped topping.

      Title: PINEAPPLE-APRICOT EMPANADITAS
 Categories: Pies, Desserts, Fruits/nuts, Cheese, Beverages
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lg Ripe pineapple
    1/2 c  Good-quality apricot
           -preserves
      3 tb Sugar
      3 tb Triple Sec
    1/4 c  Fine dry bread crumbs,
           (commerically prepared)

MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
      2 c  Unbleached a-p flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      8 oz Unsalted butter, slightly
           -softened
      6 oz Cream cheese, slightly soft

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1    Egg, beated with 1T water
      3 tb Sugar
 
  With a serrated knife, remove the top from the pineapple. Quarter the
  pineapple vertically and trim away the tough core from each quarter.
  Cut the pineapple flesh away from the rind. Chop the pineapple; there
  should be about 2 3/4 cups.  In a medium saucepan, combine the
  pineapple, apricot jam, sugar, and Triple Sec. Set over medium heat
  and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, stirring often, until thick,
  about 40 minutes. Cool to room temperature, and in a food processor
  partially puree the pineapple mixture.  Some texture should remain.
  Stir in the bread crumbs. (Filling can be prepared up to 2 days
  ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
  
  In the work bowl of a food processor, combine the flour and salt and
  pulse briefly to blend.  Add the butter and cream cheese and process
  until a soft dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
  work surface and divide it in half.  Gather each half into a ball,
  kneading briefly if necessary until smooth, and flatten each ball
  into a 5-inch disk. Wrap the disks of dough separately in plastic and
  refrigerate for at least 5 hours. (The dough can be prepared up to
        2    days ahead.)
  
  Let the discs of dough stand at room temperature until softened
  slightly. Dust one disc of dough with flour and on a well-floured
  surface roll it out to about 1/8-inch thick. Using a 3 1/2-inch
  circular cutter, form the dough into about 12 rounds.  Lay the rounds
  in a single layer on a plate or cookie sheet, wrap in plastic, and
  return them to the refrigerator. Repeat with remaining dough.  (The
  rounds of dough can be prepared 1 day ahead.)
  
  Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat
  the oven to 375F.  Lightly butter two large baking sheet pans.
  
  Let the rounds of cream cheese pastry soften at room temperature just
  until flexible.  Making one at a time, spread a heaping teaspoon of
  pineapple filling across the center of each round, leaving a border.
  Fold the round in half, then pinch the edges of the empanadita to
  seal and crimp it decoratively.  Repeat with the remaining pastry
  rounds and filling, transferring the completed empanaditas to the
  baking sheets and spacing them well apart.  Brush each empanadita
  with the egg wash and sprinkle it lightly with sugar. Bake the
  emapanaditas, changing the position of the sheets on the racks from
  top to bottom and from front to back at the halfway point, until they
  are puffed, crisp, and golden, about 20 minutes. Cool them on a rack
  before serving.  (The empanaditas can be prepared up to 1 day ahead
  and stored, airtight, at room temperature.)

 Categories: Desserts, Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE SORBET----------------------------
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Strained fresh orange juice,
           -from about 2 lb oranges
           Juice of 1 large lime
      1    Ripe pineapple, peeled,
           -cored, coarsely chopped
      3 ts Chopped fresh mint leaves

MMMMM-------------------PINEAPPLE-MINT GARNISH------------------------
    1/2    Ripe pineapple, peeled,
           -cored, finely chopped
    1/4 c  Cointreau (optional)
      2 tb Chopped fresh mint leaves
 
  To make the sorbet:  Combine the sugar and water ina large saucepan
  and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
  Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Meanwhile, combine the orange
  and lime juices. Puree the pineapple in a food processor fitted with
  a steel blade or blender along with the mint leaves. Use some of the
  orange juice to moisten. Combine with the orange-lime juice. Stir the
  pineapple mixture into the cooled syrup.  Either freeze in an ice
  cream freezer or freeze in a covered bowl.  When frozen solid, remove
  from the bowl and spoon into a food processor fitted with the steel
  blade. Process until fluffy; this breaks up the ice crystals and
  results in a smoother texture. To ensure this very smooth texture,
  repeat the process one more time after a couple of hours (this step
  is optional). Spoon into individual serving dishes, cover with
  plastic and then foil, and freeze. Or oil a loaf pan or mold and line
  with plastic wrap. Pour in the sorbet mixture, cover tightly with
  plastic wrap and then foil, and freeze. Work quickly so that the
  sorbet doesn't melt, or ice crystals will form again when it freezes.
  To make the garnish and serve:  Toss together the chopped pineapple
  and the Cointreau if you using it.  Add the mint leaves. Set aside or
  refrigerate until ready to serve. Twenty minutes before serving,
  place the sorbet in the refrigerator to soften. If you froze it in
  the loaf pan, unmold on a platter.  Cut slices using sharp knife. IF
  you froze it in individual molds, unmold into bowls. Serve, topping
  each serving with the garnish. Advance preparation:  This sorbet will
  hold for weeks, covered tightly, in the freezer.  The garnish can be
  made several hours ahead of serving time and held in a covered bowl
  in the refrigerator. Calories: 86. Fat: .40 g. Sodium 1 mg. Protein 1

      Title: PINEY WOODS HUSH PUPPIES
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Yellow Corn Meal
      1 ts Soda
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Granulated Sugar
      2 tb All-Purpose Flour
      1 tb Baking Powder
      1    Egg, beaten
      2 c  Buttermilk
  1 1/2 c  Cooking Oil (about)
 
  Mix all dry ingredients; beat milk and egg together and combine with
  dry ingredients; batter should hold its shape when picked up in
  spoon. If it is too soft, add more cornmeal. Drop by molded
  Tablespoon into 350"F fat and cook about 1 1/2 minutes; turn and cook
  on second side 1 minute. Allow oil to heat a few seconds after
  removing a batch. Delicious freshly cooked and hot; however, leftover
  hush puppies freeze well. When ready to serve frozen hush puppies,
  place on oven rack in preheated 250"F until very hot and crisp. Makes
  about 48 hush puppies 2" round. Hints on frying: Using a small
  diameter heavy saucepan allows using a minimum oil; a 5 or 6 inch pan
  with oil 1 1/2 inches deep and heated to 350"F will cook three hush
  puppies in about 2 1/2 minutes. When batter consistency is correct
  and oil is at 350"F, hush puppies will become firm, round shapes
  almost as soon as they enter the hot oil. If they are cooked in oil
  that is too hot, they will not cook in the center. Serving
  suggestions: Especially good served with fried catfish, trout,
  shrimp, oysters, chicken or chicken-fried steak. Source: Texas

      Title: PINK CRUSTACEAN CHEESE BISCUITS - RED LOBSTER
 Categories: Bread quick
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  1/4 ts Garlic salt or powder 1/4 tb Parsley flakes 1/4 ts Italian
  seasonings 1 lb Bisquick 8 3/4 oz Cold water 1/4 lb Cheddar cheese,
  ~sharp,grated 1/8 c Butter or margarine
  
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
  large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
  After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
  with garlic powder, parsley flakes and italian seasoning. (Amounts
  will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
  Serve hot.
  
  The Red Lobster manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
  have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you
  desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2
  cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12
  biscuits.
  
  You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the water, if
  desired.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 ga Pink or ruby red grapefruit
           -juice
      2 tb Honey
    1/2 c  Triple Sec Liqueur
      8    Sprigs of fresh mint for
           -garnish
 
  With an ice cream maker: 1. Combine juice, honey and liqueur and
  chill. 2. Following the instructions of your ice cream machine,
  process the juice mixture until thick and frozen. 3. Scoop sorbet
  into chilled stem glasses and serve garnished with a sprig of mint.
  
  Without an ice cream maker: 1. Combine juice, honey and liqueur as in
  the recipe above. 2. Pour the liquid sorbet mixture into a 9-inch by
  13-inch cake pan. Freeze. 3. When frozen, shave the now solid mixture
  with a metal spatula. Place shavings in serving glasses and serve
  immediately. 4. You may instead break the frozen sorbet into pieces
  that will fit a food processor. Using the on and off button, process
  the sorbet until it is very coarsely granulated. Serve immediately.
  
  Notes: For best results use Ruby Red grapefruits. They are sweeter and
  color the sorbet a gorgeous pink.

 Categories: Beverages, Herbs
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  -Distilled water
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      6 lg Strawberries; hulled -OR-
    1/4 c  Pink hisbicus flowers; dried
           -pesticide free
    1/4 c  Lavender leaves; chopped -OR

  2 1/4 c  Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Sugar; optional
           Fresh lavender flowers
           -for garnish
 
  The original recipe calls for hibiscus flowers and suggested
  strawberries as a substitute. I have reversed the order. As well, I
  don't think it is necessary to use distilled water in most locations.
  In medium saucepan, combine 2 1/2 cups water, sugar and hibiscus
  flowers (or hulled strawberries). Bring to a boil, stirring to
  dissolve sugar. Reduce heat. Simmer 5 minutes to extract pink to
  extract pink from flowers. Remove from heat. Stir in lavender leaves.
  Cover and cool. Strain cooled herb liquid into large pitcher or jar
  (if using strawberries, gently press juice from berries.) Add
  remaining 2 1/2 cups water and lemon juice. Stir well. Add 1/2 cup
  more sugar, if desired. Just before serving, add ice cubes. Pour into
  chilled glasses.Garnish with lavender flowers. YIELD: 6-8 Servings

      Title: PINTO BEAN BURGERS
 Categories: Main dish, Grill, Vegetarian, Mark's
      Yield: 20 Burgers
 
      2 c  Pinto beans, soaked
      4 ea Dried red chiles
      4 ea Garlic cloves, halved
      4 c  Water
    1/2 ts Sage
      2 tb Parsley
    1/2 ts Hungarian paprika
           Salt & pepper
           Flour, as needed
           Oil, for brushing
 
  Rinse soaked beans.  Cover with water, add the chiles & garlic cloves,
  bring to a boil & simmer for 1 hour or until very soft. When cooked,
  drain well & mash with a potato masher (Note: I have tried running
  these through a processor, but their consistency is much softer). Do
  not remove the chiles or garlic unless you really do not want the
  extra taste. Preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  Add the remaining ingredients & mix very well.  Add enough flour to
  ensure that the patties will hold together. Divide mixture into 20
  equal portions & shape into a ball. Flatten each ball into a pattie &
  place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet.  Brush each pattie with a
  little vegetable oil & bake for 10 minutes. Flip the patties, brush
  with oil & bake for another 10 minutes.  The baking helps them hold
  together better. Cool on wire racks.
  
  To serve, fry or grill as you would any burger & serve with all the
  fixings.  They also freeze reasonably well.

  Sort through the beans and discard any misshapen beans or stones.
  Rinse well. Place the beans in a saucepan and add the water. Bring to
  a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the
  smallest bean is cooked through and creamy inside, about 1 1/2 hours.
  Remove from the heat and set aside.
  
  In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the vegetable oil. Add the
  onions, salt and pepper and saute until the onions are lightly
  browned, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes
  longer. Add the beans and their liquid and the stock or water. Bring
  to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer uncovered, stirring
  occasionally, until the beans start to break apart, 20-30 minutes.
  Remove the beans from the heat and let cool slightly.
  
  Meanwhile, make the salsa: In a bowl, stir together the tomatoes,
  onion, cilantro, lime juice and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and
  refrigerate until you are ready to serve.
  
  Working in batches, transfer the bean mixture to a blender and puree
  until smooth. Transfer the puree to a clean saucepan and reheat over
  low heat, stirring frequently, until hot.(If not serving immediately,
  keep warm over very low heat, stirring often.)
  
  Ladle the soup into warmed shallow bowls and top each serving with a
  spoonful of salsa and a dollop of crema or sour cream.

           -- cut in eighths
           Salt and pepper; to taste

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      1 sm Bunch Italian parsley
           -- (opt'l.)
 
  *Strip leaves from the thyme sprigs, to equal abt. 2 tb. of fresh
  thyme.
  
  **Cut carrots diagonally into 1/2" thick slices.
  
  ***Cut celery ribs diagonally into 1/2" thick slices.
  
  Tie bay leaves, thyme and allspice berries together in a piece of
  cheesecloth; set aside.
  
  Brown lamb on all sides in a large (at least 8 qt.) heavy stockpot
  over medium-high heat, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the onions and garlic and
  cook, stirring frequently, until onions begin to turn translucent, 3
  to 4 minutes.
  
  Add the cheesecloth bundle, wine, horseradish, Worcestershire and all
  the vegetables to the meat, crushing the tomatoes with your hands or
  a wooden spoon.  Season generously with salt and pepper.  Bring to a
  boil, then cover, reduce heat to medium, and cook until potatoes are
  tender and lamb is falling from the bone, about 3 hours. (You can
  also transfer the stew to a preheated 350 F. oven and cook it there
  for the same amount of time.)
  
  Remove cover and continue cooking the stew until it has thickened
  somewhat but is still soupy, an additional 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove
  the cheesecloth bundle and season to taste, adding more horseradish
  if you like. Mince parsley; sprinkle over stew.  Serve immediately.
  
  Yield: 8 to 10 servings.  St. Francis Merlot 1987 goes well with this.
  
  Note: This is a good dish to prepare a day ahead. Remove the
  cheesecloth bundle and refrigerate the stew overnight. The next day,
  skim any fat that has solidified on the surface and reheat the stew.
  Season to taste, adding more horseradish if you like. Garnish with
  parsley and serve.
  
  Loomis writes:  "This recipe comes from Ann Olson, whose husband,
  Sherman, raises sheep - and the grains they eat - on their farm in
  Danvers, Minnesota.  Ann makes a variety of lamb dishes throughout
  the year, and this is one of her favorites.  ('Pipestone' is the name
  of a town in southern Minnesota, the home of a school where
  youngsters learn to raise sheep.  This stew, which has evolved over
  the years, is made there.)
  
  "Horseradish is a curious seasoning for lamb, but it adds a pleasant
  bite...Lamb stew meat is often neck meat, which is some of the most
  flavorful on the animal. If you do use neck meat, consider removing
  the considerable amount of bone before serving the stew."

           -fresh coconuts and 4 cups
           Milk
    3/4 c  Rice flour
      1 ts Salt
 
  In a heavy 2- to 3-qt sauce pan, scald 3 cups of the coconut milk by
  warming it over moderate heat until tiny bubbles form around the edge
  of the pan.  Combine the remaining 1 cup of coconut milk with the
  rice flour and salt in a small bowl and, stirring constantly, pour it
  gradually into the scalded milk. Reduce the heat to low and cook,
  stirring, until the mixture is thick and smooth.
  
  Pour the pudding into a lightly buttered or oiled 1-quart metal or
  porcelain mold or into 6 individual 6- to 8-oz custard molds and cool
  it to room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or
  until the pudding is firm.
  
  The pudding may be served directly from the mold(s) in which it
  chilled, or it may be unmolded in the following fashion: Run a thin,
  sharp knife around the inside edge of the mold and dip the bottom of
  the mold in hot water for a few seconds.  Place an inverted plate
  over the top of the mold and, grasping the plate and mold firmly
  together in both hands, quickly turn them upside down. Rap the plate
  sharply on the table. The pudding should slip out of the mold easily.

  I felt like a chemist making the stuff.  I put it on a back burner
  under the vent and stood back while stirring it. I didn't know what
  to expect. I tasted the sauce by just dipping a spoon into it and
  letting the sauce drain off the spoon and then gently taking a little
  taste by placing the spoon on the tip of my tongue. At first nothing,
  then after about 15 seconds or so it kicks in. Actually tasted pretty
  good. Walt MM

  PIROHI DOUGH:
  
  Mix together the three ingredients. Knead until hard enough to roll
  out like a pie crust. Over-kneading will make it tough.
  
  Roll out - not too thick or thin. Cut into squares.
  
  All fillings (below) should be cold when placed in the center of the
  square. Fold dough in half to form a triangle. Tuck in corners and
  pinch edges together. Keep fingers dry. When all of the pirohi are
  made, drop a few at a time in a pot of salted boiling water. Cook,
  for 3 or 4 minutes - should come to the top of the water when cooked.
  Remove pirohi from pot and throw into cold water. Remove immediately.
  Dry on cloth or brush with butter to prevent them from sticking
  together. They may be frozen when dry.
  
  To serve: Place in pan with a little water. Cover with foil and warm
  in oven. When warm, pour butter or onion mixture on top and serve.

           Butter for saute'ing
           Chopped herbs to taste
      1    Chopped hard-boiled egg
           Sour cream to bind

MMMMM---------------------BUCKWHEAT FILLING--------------------------
      8 oz Kasha (buckwheat groats)
      1    Medium onion
    1/4 lb Fresh mushrooms
      1    Hard-boiled egg
 
  FOR THE DOUGH: Dissolve the yeast and a pinch of sugar in the warm
  water. Sprinkle in a teaspoon of flour and leave for 15 minutes in a
  warm place. Pour into a bowl, mix in the softened butter, sifted
  flour and salt, the milk and the beaten eggs, and knead into a smooth
  dough. Leave to rise until it has doubled in volume. Knead again and
  roll out. Cut out in small circles:  you will be folding these in
  half to enclose the filling in a semi-circle or canoe shape.  Brush
  the inner edges with a little milk to help them seal firmly. Then
  either brush the piroshki with egg and bake in a moderate to hot oven
  for about 10 minutes, until golden brown: or fry them, uncoated, in
  deep fat. FOR THE MEAT FILLING: Lightly fry the onion in the oil or
  butter, add the meat and cook for 5 minutes. Combine in a bowl with
  the seasoning and herbs and allow to cool. Pirozhki often come out
  rather dry  because of the small quantities of filling which cannot,
  as with a pie, be moistened by the last-minute addition of stock.
  Both suet and frozen stock in little chips have been recommended to
  me by conscientious Russian pastry cooks to cure this fault. My
  objections are that suet makes the pirozhki undesireably fatty, while
  the chipped stock needs forethought and a sledgehammer, both of which
  go missing when I am in a hurry.  A better solution, I think, is to
  use stock either naturally or artificially jellied with gelatine.
  Add 2 teaspoons, finely chopped, to the mixture when it is absolutely
  cold from the refrigerator, bind with egg and use immediately. FOR
  THE MUSHROOM FILLING: Chop the fresh mushrooms into quarters and cook
  gently in butter with finely chopped herbs for 15 minutes.  Season,
  add a little chopped onion, chopped hardboiled egg or rice or both,
  and enough sour cream to make a fairly moist filling. FOR THE
  BUCKWHEAT FILLING: Cook the kasha in salted water for about 15
  minutes until soft but not mushy. Drain well and combine with chopped
  hard-boiled egg, chopped fried onions, and chopped mushrooms saute'ed
  in butter. Add seasoning and herbs to taste. Allow the mixture to
  cool thoroughly in the refrigerator and add little pieces of very
  cold butter. Use immediately. ...These are basic traditional
  fillings, but there is plenty of scope for invention along
  non-Russian lines;  for example, egg and mushroom filling, moistened
  with butter....

      Title: PIROSKI
 Categories: Appetizers, Greek
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------THE CRUST------------------------------
    1/3 c  Milk
      3 pk Granular yeast
      4 c  Flour
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      4 ea Egg yolks
      1 ts Salt
           Oil for frying

MMMMM------------------------THE FILLING-----------------------------
      1 lb Chopped meat
      2 tb Butter
      1 sm Onion, chopped
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
      4 tb Parmesan cheese, grated
      1 ea Egg white, beaten with a>>>d
           Few drops of water.
           Parsley, chopped
 
     Heat milk to lukewarm, pour into a bowl; add yeast. Mix with you
  fingers.  Add a cup of the flour, and mix to form a ball. Cover the
  bowl, and set in a warm place. Let the sponge rise until double in
  bulk. Punch down.  Add vegetable oil, egg yolks, salt and remaining
  flour, mix well, then knead to make a stiff dough. (Add more water or
  flour, if necessary.) Cover and let rise again.
  
     Meantime, brown the meat in butter.  Add onion, and cook until
  light brown.  Mix in tomato sauce and parsley, and cook abt. 15 to 20
  min. Stir in grated cheese.
  
     Lightly flour a bread board and turn dough out onto it; knead until
  elastic.  Divide  into small pcs. Flatten these with your hands, or
  roll into thick round shapes. In the center of each, place a tbs. of
  the meat mixture.  Fold over dough to form a half-moon shape. Brush
  edges with a little egg white, and pinch to seal. Flatten the piroski
  slightly and place on a buttered baking sheed. Set aside in warm
  place to rise again, but for less time.  Deep-fat fry until a deep
  golden color. Remove with slotted spoon, drain, and serve hot. Makes
  about 15 to 18 piroski.
  
     NOTE 1:  These can be baked instead of fried.  To bake follow the
  directions above to the final rising, then brush tops with egg white,
  and bake in preheated 350 F. oven until golden brown.
  
     NOTE 2:  The filling can be of chicken, ham, fish, or hard-cooked
  eggs.
   For any of these, chop the filling and mix with Bechamel sauce, or
  mashed potaotes.
  
     NOTE 3:  You can also make sweet piroski by adding 3 tbs. sugar
  when you add the salt.  Fill dough with marmalade and chopped glazed
  fruit. Bake as in Note 1 above, and top with confectioner's sugar.

      Title: PIROZHKI
 Categories: Russian, Sandwiches
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           ---For dough---
      2 tb To 3 dried yeast
      1 pn Sugar
      5 tb Water; warm
  2 1/2 oz Butter; softened
      1 lb Flour
      1 pn Salt
    1/2 c  Milk
      2    Eggs
      1    Filling*
 
  Dough: Dissolve the yeast and a pinch of sugar in the warm water.
  Sprinkle in a teaspoon of flour and leave for 15 minutes in a warm
  place.
   Pour into a bowl, mix in the softened butter, sifted flour and salt,
  the milk and the beaten eggs, and knead into a smooth dough. Leave to
  rise until it has doubled in volume. Knead again and roll out.
  
  To assemble:  Cut (the dough) out in small circles in which you can
  enclose the filling in a semi-circle or canoe shape. Choose from any
  or all of the fillings given (below), and seal the edges carefully
  with a little milk. Either brush with egg and bake in a moderate to
  hot oven for about 10 minutes until golden brown, or fry them
  uncoated in deep fat.
  
  Meat filling: Lightly fry 1 onion in 1 tbsp. oil or butter, add 1/2
  pound minced beef or veal or chicken and cook for 5 minutes. Combine
  in a bowl with the seasoning and herbs and allow to cool.
  
  Mushroom filling: Chop 3/4-1 lb fresh mushrooms into quarters and cook
  gently in butter with finely chopped herbs for 15 minutes. Season,
  add a little chopped onion, chopped hard-boiled egg or rice or both,
  and enough sour cream to make a fairly moist filling.
  
  Fish filling: Any white fish, though preferably firm, is suitable
  here. You will need 1/2 to 3/4 pounds, weighed after boning. If the
  fish is cooked specially for the purpose, bring it to the boil once
  in a court-bouillon, remove and bone it.
   Combine with 2-3 oz rice or cooked unsweetened semolina or sago, add
  seasoning and chopped herbs, especially dill, to taste, and chopped
  hard- boiled egg. A little anchovy essence or jellied fish stock will
  add greatly to the flavour of these pirozhki and keep the filling
  moist.
  
  Note: " Pirozhki often come out rather dry because of the small
  quantity of filling which cannot...be moistened by the last-minute
  addition of stock. ...A (good) solution, I think, is to use stock
  either naturally or artificially jellified with gelatin. Add 2
  teaspoons, finely chopped, to the mixture when it is absolutely cold
  from the refrigerator, bind with egg and use straight away....These
  tiny pasties (are) usually eaten with a clear meat, chicken or
  mushroom broth....

      2 lg Onions; Use 3 If You Like
           -Onions, Chopped
    1/4 lb Butter; 1 Stick
      1 c  Mushroom Mix
      1 tb Salt
      1 ts Black Pepper; To Taste
     16 oz Canned Tomatoes
      1    Bouillon Cube; OR
      1 tb Maggi Sauce
           ;Tomato Juice Or Water As
           -Needed
 
  Combine the rice and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, stir
  gently, cover and cook for about 20 minutes. Cool in a large bowl.
  Core the cabbage and place it in a large pot or Dutch oven half
  filled with water, cover, and bring to a boil.  Cook about 2 minutes.
  As the outer leaves become translucent and soft, pry off and remove
  with a wooden spoon. Continue until the head is about 5 inches in
  diameter, remove and save for Cabbage Filling, (Recipe will be
  included in the next bunch). Trim the leaves by paring of the thick
  part of the rib. In a large skillet, saute the chopped onions in
  melted butter until lightly cooked. Add the onions and mushroom mix
  to the rice, stir gently but do NOT mash. Add salt and pepper to
  taste. Line the bottom of a baking dish with the outer cabage leaves.
  Place a large spoonful of the filling at the stem end of each leaf,
  fold over the sides and roll from the bottom to the top. Do NOT
  overstuff or the results will look like hand granades. The rice will
  expand when baked.  Without crowding, arrange in neat layers in the
  baking dish, covering the last layer with a few cabbage leaves.
  Coarsely chop the tomatoes and pour over the rolls.  Add the bouillon
  cube or Maggi seasoning, cover, and bake in a preheated 325 Degree F.
  oven for about 2 hours.  Add tomato juice or water as needed, there
  should be 2 to 3 inches of liquid at the bottom.  Baked rolls will
  keep hot for about 1 hour.
  
  Yield: About 2 dozen.  To freeze before baking, place the rolls on an
  oiled baking sheet and freeze until rigid, then store in heavy
  plastic bags. Serve with mushroom gravy.

  yeast dissolved in about 2 tablespoons tepid water. Mix and knead
  until the dough comes away clean from the sides of the bowl. Shape
  into a ball, make a deep cross-cut on the top, put on a floured
  plate, cover with a floured cloth, and leave in a warm place to rise
  for 2 hours. FILLING: Heat 3 or 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy
  fry-pan. Put in the onions and cook them very gently, with a cover on
  the pan, until quite soft and a pale golden colour.  Add the tomatoes
  and the seasonings (plus chopped garlic to taste, if desired) and
  continue cooking until the onions and tomatoes have amalgamated, and
  the moisture from the tomatoes has evaporated.
  
  When the dough has risen; sprinkle it with flour and break it down
  again. Knead once more into a ball and place in the centre of an
  oiled 8-inch tart pan. Press the dough quickly but gently with your
  knuckles outwards to the edge of the pan and up the rim.  Put in the
  filling. Make a criss-cross lattice pattern with the anchovy fillets,
  placing a halved olive in the centre of each opening in the lattice.

      Yield: 4 Dozen
 
      3 oz Box Vanilla Pudding
           -mix, (NOT instant)
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      5 oz Can Evaporated milk
      2 tb Butter or Margarine
      1 tb Pistachio
           Green food coloring
    1/2 c  Pistachio nuts, chopped
 
  Grease an 8 x 13-inch cake pan or candy molds (if you have them). Set
  aside.
  
  In a medium saucepan, combine the pudding mix, sugar and evaporated
  milk. Stir to combine. Over medium heat, bring mixture to a boil.
  Continue boiling 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and
  stir in the butter and flavoring. Tint to desired color.
  
  Pour mixture into a medium bowl. Beat on high speed with an electric
  mixer 4-5 minutes or until mixture thickens and is no longer glossy.
  Fold in the pistachio nuts.
  
  Pour mixture into candy molds, or into the greased pan.
  
  Refrigerate until firm.
  
  Wrap candy pieces in plastic wrap, or if you can find it, colored
  paper. Of course you'll have to cut the candy in the pan. If you have
  small hors d' ouvre cutters, that would work in lieu of the candy
  molds. Plain ol' squares work too.
  
  Find a pretty box to put the candy in if you'll be giving these as
  gifts. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

      Title: PISTACHIO ICE CREAM
 Categories: Desserts, Ice cream
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Milk
      3    Eggs
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Whipping cream, whipped
  1 1/4 c  Pistachio nuts.
      1 tb Pure vanilla extract
      1 tb Pure almond extract
 
  BLANCH  the nuts by placing in a bowl for one minute and pouring
  boiling water over it (  the nuts should be out of the shells). Drain
  and peel. BLEND the nuts, the milk, the eggs, and the sugar until you
  have a green smooth liquid.  Pour into a saucepan. COOK over low heat
  until the custard thickens, about 25 minutes or so. Do not boil or it
  will curdle. COOL. When cool, add vanilla and almond extracts.  Stir.
  FOLD in whipped cream.
  
  FREEZE in an ice cream maker or in a container or bowl in your
  freezer. If you use the bowl in freezer method, you should pull the
  bowl out 2 or 3 times and mix the mixture with a mixer. The frozen
  custard on the sides of the bowl should be moved into the rest of the
  mixture. This incorporates air and breaks up ice crystals.
  
  This ice cream takes a LOT of time, particularly considering that you
  have to blanch the nuts.  If you don't mind lots of peel in your ice
  cream, you can pass, but this makes a really unsavory ice cream.
  
  If you've never had homemade ice cream before, you will be surprised
  at the richer, tastier, smoother, and denser ice cream a homemade
  version will give you. You will have to soften it before scooping it,
  as real ice cream always requires.

      1 c  Shelled and chopped
           Pistachio nuts, toasted
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      8 tb (1 stick) butter or

    1/2 lb (8 ounces) Monterey Jack
           Cheese, shredded (2 to
           2-1/2 cups, loosely packed)
    1/4 c  Half-and-half
 
  "Exceedingly rich, these crackers have a pronounced pistachio flavor.
  They are quite versatile and can be enjoyed with a cup of hot tea or
  a dish of ice cream. 325~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to
  325~F.
  
  Mix the flour, nuts, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl or in
  the food processor. Cut the butter into the flour mixture until it
  resembles coarse meal. Add the cheese and mix until the cheese is
  coated evenly.
  
  Slowly add enough of the half-and-half to form a dough that will hold
  together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to about 1/4 inch thick. With a
  sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares and arrange them on an
  ungreased baking sheet. Make sure the edges are not touching.
  
  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Don't let these Meltaways get more than
  medium brown. Cool them on a rack. Yield: 50-60.
  
  VARIATIONS: If pistachios are not available, cashews or macadamias are
  excellent substitutes.

    1/3 c  Shelled pistachios
           Corn oil, as needed
      6 oz White chocolate fine chopped
    1/4 c  Heavy cream
      1 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract

      9 oz Semisweet chocolate,
           -finely chopped

MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
    1/3 c  Pistachio pieces
 
  Make the truffles: 1. In a food processor, grind the pistachios until
  a paste forms. If the nuts are very dry, add the corn oil, 1/2
  teaspoon at a time, with the machine running. The consistency of the
  paste should be like dry peanut butter. Set aside.

  microwave-safe medium bowl. Heat on high power for 1 minute. Remove
  from the microwave and stir. If the chocolate is still fairly solid,
  heat for another 30 seconds. Stir the mixture until smooth. If there
  still seem to be several unmelted pieces of chocolate, heat again for
  about 20 seconds, and then stir.
  
  3. Add the vanilla and reserved pistachio paste and stir until smooth.

 Categories: Appetizers, Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        1 x  Pita bread
  
  Microwave Pita bread just to soften (approx 22 seconds/2 pita bread)
  
  Cut with a knife into the edges of the Pita Bread and slowly separate
  the 'top' from the 'bottom' (you will have two circles)
  
  Cut each circle into 4 pie shaped wedges.
  
  Place the wedges smooth side down (outside of pita bread) on a cookie
  sheet. The rough (somewhat moist) inside of the Pita bread is up -
  thus anything you sprinkle on the wedges will stick.
  
  I like to sprinkle the wedges with Hungarian Hot Paprika
  
  Bake 375 degrees for 8 minutes.

  dish. Add the spinach mixture and cover with remaining 1-1/2 sheets
  of the matzoh for the pie cover.  Brush with the reserved 1 teaspoon
  of oil and sprinkle the walnuts over the top.  Bake in a preheated
  350 degrees F oven for 30 minutes.
  
  Serve warm, cut into generous squares or triangles.
  
  VARIATIONS:
  
  1.  Mix 1/2 pound ground beef with the spinach, eggs, salt, pepper,
  and matzoh meal, and proceed as above.
  
  2.  Or chop 1/4 pound farmer cheese and 1/4 pound of feta cheese. Mix
  this with the spinach, eggs, salt, pepper, and matzoh meal, and
  proceed as for the spinach pie. This cheese dish could be (but is
  not, traditionally) eaten during Passover, but it is usually prepared
  for other days.
  
  In my opinion, substituting sheets of matzoh in place of the fragile
  sheets of fillo (which are not kosher for Passover) is ingenious. It
  results in a different taste and is an admirable solution for the
  kosher kitchen.

      Title: PITA OF GREENS~ HERBS & EGGS
 Categories: Greek, Vegetarian
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      2 lb Fresh greens *
           Salt (see note at end)
    1/2 bn Fresh parsley; chopped
    1/2 bn Fresh dill; chopped
      1    Handful fresh chervil; chop.
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
      1 bn Scallions; chopped
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
      2 ts Granulated sugar
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      5    Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 c  Crumbled feta cheese
    1/2 c  Milk, or more
    1/2 c  Butter (optional); melted
     12    Commercial filo sheets
 
  Traditional and individualistic.  Village women learn to gather
  tender, young greens from their rocky surroundings, which ironically
  produce the most beautiful wild flowers and delicious greens. When
  greens are bought in the markets, spinach is the most frequently
  substituted. Cretans combine dandelions and spinach. This recipe is
  written as recipes are spoken in Greece, in the warm first-person
  plural.
  
  *Note: Suggested greens are: Spinach, dandelions, chicory, endive or
  any other fresh greens.
  
  First we wash the spinach, trim coarse ends, drain, chop, sprinkle
  with salt, and squeeze until all liquid has been drained. Now we
  combine the spinach in a large bowl with the parsley, dill, and
  chervil and mix thoroughly.  Allowing the greens to stand while
  heating the 1/4 cup butte in a large frying pan, we add the scallions
  to the butter and saute them until the white parts are translucent.
  Continuing to cook over medium heat, we add the greens, the spices,
  sugar, and enough salt and pepper for seasoning, careful to allow for
  additional salt in the feta, which will be added later.  We partially
  cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes, or until all the liquid has
  been absorbed, then we remove it from the heat and cool the mixture
  in a large bowl.  Now we add the eggs, feta, and enough milk to
  saturate the greens, mix, and assemble the pita as follows:
  
  Butter a 15 x 11 x 2-inch baking pan.  Spread 6 filo sheets, brushing
  each with melted butter.  Pour in the filling, spreading evenly.
  Cover with the remaining filo sheets, brushing each with butter.
  Flute the edges and brush top with butter.  Using a sharp knife,
  score the top 3 filo sheets into square or diamond shapes. Bake for
  45 minutes in a moderate oven (350 F) and allow to cool slightly
  before slicing and serving it warm.
  
  Note: You may eliminate the salting of the spinach by panning it,
  cooking over very low heat until the leaves wilt, and then draining
  it thoroughly.

      Title: PIX ROWE MILLER'S FAMILY FISH CHOWDER
 Categories: Fish, Soup
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 sl Bacon -- 1/4" thick
      3 c  Diced yellow onions
      6 md Potatoes -- peeled
      1 lb Haddock
      1 lb Cod
      2 cn Evaporated milk -- (3 cups)
      1 c  Whole milk
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  Fry the bacon, remove from the pan, and place on a paper towel. Saute
  the onions in the bacon fat and set the pan aside. Cut the potatoes
  in half the long way, then into 1/4" slices. Put them in a
  nonreactive pot large enough for the chowder. Cover the potatoes with
  water and boil until tender. Becareful not to put in too much water
  or the chowder will be soupy. While the potatoes are cooking, cut the
  fish into generous bite-sized pieces. When the potatoes are ready,
  add the fish to the pot, cover and simmer until the fish flakes. When
  the fish is done, crumble the bacon and add it to the pot along with
  the onions and any grease in the pan, the evaporated and whole milks.
  Bring the mixture to boil, cover, and turn the heat down. Simmer for
  five minutes and add salt and pper to taste. Chowder invariably
  tastes better when made a day ahead.
  
  According to Katherine Hall Page.... The Rowe recipe may be happily
  modified in all sorts of ways. The chowder is still quite delectable
  with olive oil instead of bacon fat. You may also use salt pork. Two
  kinds of fish make for a more interesting chowder, but these can be
  any combination of the following: haddock, cod, pollack, monkfish and
  hake. Finally there is the question of garnishes: dill chopped
  parsley, oyster crackers, butter are all good. And Faith and Pix's
  friend on Sanpere, Jane Weiss, swears by her chowder to which she
  adds curry spices!

      Title: PIZZA
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 c  Tepid water
      2 pk Instant yeast
      4 tb Olive oil
  5 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Corn meal
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Salad oil
 
  Mix this with 3 c flour for about 10 minutes. Then add rest of flour
  and kneed 15 more minutes. Let dough rise once to double size. Punch
  down. Then divide the dough in two (makes two pizzas). Spread out
  dough flat. Oil the pan with olive oil and sprinkle with corn meal.
  Spread the dough out in the pan and spread it around to cover the
  entire bottom, then push it up the sides - like a pie crust.  If it
  doesn't cover the whole pan push it around til it does. Let it rise
  again. Put thin slices of mozzarella over the entire bottom of the
  pizza. Squish and drain well one large can of skinned plum tomatoes,
  and spread that over the cheese. Add a smidge of salt (I also add
  ground black pepper). Chop or crush garlic over this (I use lots).
  Basil and oregano sprinkled generously on top. Put on filing to taste
  (I use sliced onions and spicy Italian sausage). Then sprinkle over
  the top a combo of fresh grated Parma and Romano. Bake for 35 to 40
  min at 475. Crust should be brown and crunchy. Hope you like it. I
  usually make two at a time, with one having no meat on it for the
  non-meat crowd (using zuccini peppers, mushrooms, onions). One pizza
  is usually enough for 4 people with a salad. Hope you like it, David.

      Title: PIZZA CRUST BY HAND
 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Warm water (110-115 deg F)
      1    Envelope (1/4oz) active dry
           Yeast
  3 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Here's a Thin Pizza Dough I've been making forever (even before I
  became fat-free) with no oil.  Note: I use a pizza stone or fire
  bricks that I purchased from a masonry supply house after I broke my
  pizza stone. Leftover slices always crisp up nicely in the toaster
  oven the next day for lunch.
  
  Sprinkle yeast over the water and stir gently until dissolved. Should
  be a smooth and beige-colored mixture. If not, throw it out and start
  again - check the expiration date on the yeast package. Put in a warm
  spot for about 5 minutes (I set it in the microwave).
  
  Put 3 cups of the flour and all the salt in a mixing bowl, stir
  together. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the
  yeast mixture. Stir from the middle, mixing in flour from the sides
  just until a soft dough forms.
  
  Turn dough out onto floured surface.  Dust your hands with flour and
  knead gently.  Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of flour until
  dough is no longer sticky or tacky - about 5 minutes. As you knead,
  scrape up bits of dough that stick to the work surface with a metal
  dough scraper. Knead 10-15 minutes until dough is smooth, elastic,
  and shiny. Knead only until smooth and springy. (Overdoing it makes a
  tough crust).
  
  Shape dough into a ball and put in clean bowl (note: don't use a cold
  bowl ~ rinse out with warm water and wipe dry). Cover bowl tightly
  with plastic wrap and put in draft-free warm place (75-85 degrees F).
  It will double in size after about an hour - takes 1-1/2 hours at
  lower temperatures.
  
  Press the air bubbles out of the dough (don't "punch" it - be gentle).
  Gently shape into a round ball.  Let rest for 10 minutes. I cover it
  with the inverted mixing bowl so that it doesn't dry out. Roll or
  stretch out into pizza shape, cover with favorite toppings and bake
  at a high temperature.  If I am going to use especially moist
  toppings, I precook the crust for 5-10 minutes.
  
  Makes a 15-16 inch pizza.  Or divide dough into two equal pieces for
  two 12-inch round flat pizzas.  Or divide into 18 equal-size portions
  for 3-inch appetizer sized pizzas.
  
  Use within 2 hours.  Or press out air bubbles again, shape into round
  ball, put in bowl covered with plastic wrap, and set in refrigerator.
  Refrigerate up to 24 hours. Let it come to room temperature before
  using.
  
  Will freeze nicely - wrap tightly in plastic and freeze up to 4
  months. Before using, thaw in refrigerator 1-2 days or a few hours at
  room temperature.

  let rise for 20 mins. Shape, top, and bake 12-15 mins. in a 500
  degree oven.
  
  Note: I haven't tested this one, so let me know if it works.
  
  By the way, I cheated and sprayed the pans a little so the pizza
  wouldn't stick. I really need to get more non-stick cookware.

      Title: PIZZA CRUST-BBS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Crust
 
  4 1/2 c  Flour (high gluten
           -recommended)
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 ts Salt
      2 c  Warm water
      2 tb Vegetable or olive oil
 
  Mix 2 cups of the flour, the yeast and salt. Add the water and oil,
  and mix thoroughly. Slowly add the remaining flour until the dough
  can be worked by hand. Knead thoroughly. Allow to rise for 30 minutes.
  
  After the rising time, roll out the dough to fit whatever pizza pan or
  baking dish you prefer. Top as desired, then bake completed pizza for
  12 to 14 minutes at 475 B0 F, testing for doneness after 10 minutes.
  
  Additional note: Since I originally found this recipe, I've learned
  that a pizza stone is by far the best way to bake a pizza at home.
  Follow the directions that accompany the stone, but typically you
  need to preheat both the oven and the stone (i.e., put the stone in
  the oven in its final position while preheating the oven) for at
  least 20 minutes before placing the pizza in the oven to bake. The
  crust should come out just great!

 Categories: Breads, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 oz Fresh yeast; -=OR=-
      2 pk - Instant dry yeast granules
    1/2 c  Milk; at room temperature
    3/4 c  Warm water (125F)
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 c  Unbleached white flour
 
  IN A LARGE BOWL, dissolve the yeast in a mixture of the milk and
  water. Mix in the flour and salt to make a soft dough. Knead 10
  minutes by hand, or 4 minutes in a heavy-duty mixer with a dough
  hook. Oil a clean bowl and set the dough in it, cover tightly with
  plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in bulk. (In the traditional
  warm place, this will take about 2 hours. However, a cooler
  temperature will do as long as the dough has enough time to rise,
  including overnight in the refrigerator.) If the dough is ready
  sooner than it is needed, punch it down and refrigerate it or let it
  rise slowly again at room temperature until ready to use. When ready
  to use, divide into 4 equal parts. Roll 1 into an 8-inch round. Top
  with favorite toppings and bake 10 minutes in 450F oven. Makes 4

      Title: PIZZA DOUGH #4
 Categories: Pizza
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Warm water (110-115 degrees)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      3    To 3-1/2 C flour
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
 
  Ok, let's start with the basics here...pizza dough. For this recipe
  there are only a few pieces of equipment you will need to have. Youll
  need a large mixing bowl and a wooden spoon (make sure it's a WOODEN
  spoon!).
  
  Begin by warming the mixing bowl by running warm water into it. It is
  important that the bowl be warmed for proper rising of the dough.
  
  Pour the water into the bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Stir gently
  with fork until yeast is dissolved and mixture is a light beige in
  color.
  
  Add the olive oil, sugar and salt and stir gently until well mixed.
  
  Slowly add the flour, one cup at a time and mix into the liquid with
  wooden spoon. When the dough begins to pull away from the side of the
  bowl, flour your counter area and begin to knead in remaining flour.
  ONLY ADD AS MUCH FLOUR AS IS NEEDED TO MAKE THE DOUGH WORKABLE.
  
  When the dough is no longer sticky, STOP working the dough!
  Overworking the dough will tend to make it tough after cooking.
  
  Place dough back into the mixing bowl and allow it to rise for at
  least one hour.
  
  The dough should now be ready for use. This dough is designed for
  "thick" crust or deep dish pizza but will work just as well for
  stuffed pizza.
  
  A few tips for making dough...you can use a food processor or mixer
  to make the dough but you will find it is better (not to mention
  easier) to work the dough by hand. DO NOT use water above 115 degrees
  as this may kill the yeast. You can get by with a one hour rise of
  the dough but to eliminate the yeast flavor it is best to allow the
  dough to go through several rises. After an hour or so punch into the
  middle of the dough to cause it to "fall", repeat this process two or
  three times before rolling (or spreading if you're talented <g>) the
  dough. Be careful how much you "work" the dough, the goal is

      Title: PIZZA DOUGH #5
 Categories: Pizza
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 tb Yeast
  1 1/3 c  Water at 40 C (100F)
      1 tb White sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Egg
      4 c  Flour
 
  I do not have any idea what "Chicago Style" is.  While virtually any
  bread recipe will work as a pizza dough, this is what I use for two
  crusts:
  
  Soften yeast in warm water for about 10 minutes.  Mix in ingredients
  (except the flour) and combine well. Add flour all at once and knead
  until a smooth dough is formed. If it is a bit sticky, then add a
  little more flour. Let rise for an hour, beat down, roll out and
  spread one's choice of toppings. If you are pressed for time, the
  first rising can be shortened to 15 minutes, but this is not
  recommended. MK

      Title: PIZZA DOUGH #6
 Categories: Pizza
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 pk Fast-rising dry yeast
      2 c  Tepid (90F) water
      2 tb Sugar
      4 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Oil
      1 ts Salt
  5 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
      3    Cloves garlic, crushed
    1/4 c  Olive oil for topping (if
           -making focaccia only)
      1 tb Whole rosemary (ditto)
      1 tb Kosher salt (ditto)
 
  From:   Ted Taylor
  
  The following recipe is for "focaccia Romana," or Roman focaccia,
  from Jeff Smith's "The Frigal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient Cuisines."
  He recommends it as the best dough for a pizza crust he's run across,
  and I must say it is both
  
  very easy and VERY good to eat.  I halved the following recipe (but
  used the full amount of garlic, plus 2 c of meaty red sauce, about 4
  oz. of pepperoni, 8-9 fresh mushrooms and 8 ounces of whole-milk
  mozzarella) and the results were great.  Lacking quick-rise yeast, I
  used regular yeast and just ate a little later -- no problem there.
  And of course, I made the dough into a pizza instead of a plain
  focaccia (which is like a thick pizza (also round, but thicker) but
  without toppings.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in the tepid water.  Add the sugar, olive oil,
  oil, and salt.  Mix in 3 c of the flour and whip until the dough
  begins to leave the sides of the mixing bowl, about ten minutes [!!].
  I [Smith] use my KitchenAid mixer for the whole process.
  
  Mix in the remaining flour by hand or with a dough hook and knead the
  dough until it is smooth.  Allow the dough to rise twice, right in
  the bowl, and punch down after each rising.
  
  Oil 2 baking sheets, each 13 inches by 18 inches, and divide the dough
  between the 2 pans.  Using your fingers, press the dough out to the
  edges of each pan. Allow to rise for about 30 minutes and brush with
  the crushed garlic mixed with the oil for topping. Sprinkle the
  rosemary and kosher salt on top.
  
  Bake at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes.

      1 tb Sugar
      1 c  Warm water as above
      1    Envelope yeast
  2 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose or
           -semolina flour
      1 c  Yellow cornmeal or polenta
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil or vegetable oil

MMMMM--------------------------NEW YORK-------------------------------
      1 c  Warm water as above
      1    Envelope yeast
  3 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is
  110-115 deg F. (When making the New York Variation, omit the sugar and
  proceed as follows). Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently
  until it dissolves, about 1 minute. Let stand in a warm spot until a
  thin layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes. Discard
  mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes.
  
  If making whole-wheat dough, combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use
  as the flour in the directions that follow.
  
  If making the cornmeal dough, combine the flour and cornmeal in a
  bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow.
  
  To mix and knead the dough by hand: Combine 3 cups of the flour with
  the salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center of the
  flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. Using a
  wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in
  the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour
  is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust your hands
  with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press
  down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from
  you, then partially fold it back over itself. Shift it a quarter turn
  and repeat the procedure. While kneading, very gradually add just
  enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer
  sticky or tacky. This should take about 5 minutes. As you work, use a
  metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the
  work surface. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic,
  and springy. Too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the flour
  and results in a tough crust.
  
  After mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and
  place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all
  sides with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent
  moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg
  F) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to
  1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast.
  
  With your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in
  bulk to prevent overrising. Shape it into a ball, pressing out all
  the air bubbles. If you are using bread flour or semolina flour, turn
  the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover again with
  plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy, from 35 minutes to 1
  hour. Omit this step if using all-purpose flour.
  
  If you cannot bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising, punch the
  dough down again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover
  the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The dough can be
  punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours
  before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable. Let chilled
  dough come to room temperature before proceeding.

      Title: PIZZA DOUGH (EW)
 Categories: Main dish, Breads
      Yield: 2 Pizzas
 
      1 ts Active dry yeast
  1 2/3 c  (to 2 C) unbleached or all-
           -purpose white flour
      1 c  Cake flour
      1 ts Salt
 
  In a measuring cup or small bowl, sprinkle yeast ovr 1/4 cup warm
  water; stir until dissolved.  In a mixing bowl, combine 1 2/3 cups of
  the unbleached or all-purpose flour, cake flour and salt. Make a well
  in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture.
  With a wooden spoon, gradually stir in the flour, adding 3/4 cup warm
  watr as you mix. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface
  and knead until very smooth, soft and no longer sticky, about 10
  minutes, adding additional flour as needed to keep the dough from
  sticking. (The dough should still be quite wet, however.)
  
  Set the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat lightly. Cover with
  plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
  
  About 10 minutes before baking pizza, turn the dough onto the floured
  board, punch it down and knead briefly. Use a pastry cutter or a thin,
  sharp knife to divide the dough in half. (If you pull the dough
  apart, you risk tearing the gluten strands.)  Pat each half into a
  ball and flatten into a disk.  Proceed as directed in any of the
  following pizza recipes. (The dough can be made ahead, enclosed in a
  plastic bag and stored in the refrigrator for up to 2 days or in the
  freezer for up to 2 months. Defrost for at least 8 hours in the
  refrigerator and bring to room temp. before using.)
  
  Makes about 1 1/2 lbs. of dough, enough for two 12-inch pizzas.

  and let rise in warm place until double 30-45 min.(you can let it
  rise at room temp for a longer period - up to 2 hrs - if that is more
  convenient, if it goes longer, punch it down and let it rise
  again,longer rise times make the dough more flavorfull).
  
  Shape dough, top it as you wish and bake in 400 oven for about 12-15
  min. I personally recommend baking it on a baking stone if you have
  one.
  
  As for the sauce- I get the Contadina in a squeeze bottle, then
  spinkle extra oregano, basil and thyme on top before adding other
  toppings.
  
  I've also had success substituting 1/2 cup of flour with white whole
  wheat flour- more than that makes the dough really stiff - I also add
  an extra tsp of honey when I sub in the wheat flour.
  
  Enjoy, Penny

      Title: PIZZA DOUGH (PRODIGY)
 Categories: Pizzas, Breads, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 oz Fresh yeast; -=OR=-
      2 pk - Instant dry yeast granules
    1/2 c  Milk; at room temperature
    3/4 c  Warm water (125F)
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 c  Unbleached white flour
 
  IN A LARGE BOWL, dissolve the yeast in a mixture of the milk and
  water. Mix in the flour and salt to make a soft dough. Knead 10
  minutes by hand, or 4 minutes in a heavy-duty mixer with a dough
  hook. Oil a clean bowl and set the dough in it, cover tightly with
  plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in bulk. (In the traditional
  warm place, this will take about 2 hours. However, a cooler
  temperature will do as long as the dough has enough time to rise,
  including overnight in the refrigerator.) If the dough is ready
  sooner than it is needed, punch it down and refrigerate it or let it
  rise slowly again at room temperature until ready to use. When ready
  to use, divide into 4 equal parts. Roll 1 into an 8-inch round. Top
  with favorite toppings and bake 10 minutes in 450F oven.

      Title: PIZZA DOUGH (THORP)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ts Active dry yeast (I am going
           To try a whole pack = 2.5
           Tsp, to see if
           It's more bready)
  1 2/3    To 2 C unbleached or
           All-purpose flour
      1 c  Cake flour
      1 ts Salt
 
  In a measuring cup or small bowl, sprinkle yeast over 1/4 cup warm
  water; stir until dissolved. In a mixing bowl, combine 1 2/3 cups of
  the unbleached or all-purpose flour, cake flour, and salt. Make a
  well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast
  mixture. With a wooden spoon, gradually stir in the flour, adding 3/4
  C warm water as you mix. Turn the doug out onto a lightly floured
  surface and knead until very smooth, soft, and no longer sticky,
  about 10 minutes, adding additional flour as needed to keep the dough
  from sticking. (The dough should still be quite wet, however.)
  
  Set the dough in [a bowl sprayed lightly with cooking spray] and turn
  to coat lightly. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled,
  2 to 2 1/2 hours.
  
  About 10 minutes before baking pizza, turn the dough onto the floured
  board, punch it down and knead briefly. Use a pastry cutter or a thin,
  sharp knife to divide the dough in half. (If you pull the dough
  apart, you risk tearing the gluten strands.) Pat each half into a
  ball and flatten into a disk.
  
  ADD TOPPINGS! =-)
  
  The dough can be made ahead, enclosed in a plastic bag, and stored in
  the refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 2
  months. Defrost for at least 8 hours in the refrigerator and bring to
  room temperature before using.)

  What I put on this pizza:
  
  A tomato sauce with oregano and garlic and a pinch of sugar, roasted
  onions, roasted peppers, roasted garlic, plumped sun dried tomatoes,
  shitake mushrooms.
  
  I also made a "turnover/calzone" type thing by placing a bean mixture
  (black beans, garlic, onion, salsa, roasted red peppers -- next time
  I want to add ff soy cheese) and baking for about 20 minutes at 350.
  I made the apple turnovers by taking 1/8th of the dough, rolling it
  thin, placing chopped apples on one half (about 1 1/2 small apples).
  The apples had been mixed with some cinnamin and a pinch of brown
  sugar. Cook both of these items on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum
  foil because they run all over the place.
  
  Hope you enjoy these!

      Title: PIZZA DOUGH - ROMAN FOCACCIA
 Categories: Pizza
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 pk Fast-rising dry yeast
      2 c  Tepid (90F) water
      2 tb Sugar
      4 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Oil
      1 ts Salt
  5 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
      3    Cloves garlic, crushed
    1/4 c  Olive oil for topping (if
           -making focaccia only)
      1 tb Whole rosemary (ditto)
      1 tb Kosher salt (ditto)
 
  From:   Ted Taylor
  
  The following recipe is for "focaccia Romana," or Roman focaccia,
  from Jeff Smith's "The Frigal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient Cuisines."
  He recommends it as the best dough for a pizza crust he's run across,
  and I must say it is both
  
  very easy and VERY good to eat.  I halved the following recipe (but
  used the full amount of garlic, plus 2 c of meaty red sauce, about 4
  oz. of pepperoni, 8-9 fresh mushrooms and 8 ounces of whole-milk
  mozzarella) and the results were great. Lacking quick-rise yeast, I
  used regular yeast and just ate a little later -- no problem there.
  And of course, I made the dough into a pizza instead of a plain
  focaccia (which is like a thick pizza (also round, but thicker) but
  without toppings.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in the tepid water.  Add the sugar, olive oil,
  oil, and salt.  Mix in 3 c of the flour and whip until the dough
  begins to leave the sides of the mixing bowl, about ten minutes [!!].
  I [Smith] use my KitchenAid mixer for the whole process.
  
  Mix in the remaining flour by hand or with a dough hook and knead the
  dough until it is smooth.  Allow the dough to rise twice, right in
  the bowl, and punch down after each rising.
  
  Oil 2 baking sheets, each 13 inches by 18 inches, and divide the dough
  between the 2 pans.  Using your fingers, press the dough out to the
  edges of each pan. Allow to rise for about 30 minutes and brush with
  the crushed garlic mixed with the oil for topping. Sprinkle the
  rosemary and kosher salt on top.
  
  Bake at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes.

    1/2 tb Yeast
  3 1/4 c  Flour
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 tb Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil
  1 1/8 c  Water

MMMMM-----------------------TO SHAPE PIZZA----------------------------
           Corn meal
 
  Bring all ingredients to room temp and add to breadmaker. Select
  "white dough" cycle and press Start.
  
  At end of cycle, remove dough and divide into halves. Preheat oven to
  450. Roll or shape into pizzas on surface dusted with cornmeal. Add
  toppings of choice and bake 15 minutes on bottom rack, to make sure
  crust gets done.
  
  Sylvia's notes: I modified this from one posted on GEnie by G.GARVEY2
  10/30/91, and was thoroughly delighted with the result. The dough was
  easy to work with and stretched well; I even played "Italian pizza
  maker" and threw the thing into the air to stretch it. We had company
  for dinner, and when I asked for comments because I wasn't an
  accomplished pizza maker, one guest responded "you are now!"

 Categories: Breads, Italian, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Pizza

      1 tb Granulated sugar
      1 c  Warm water, 110-115 deg F
    1/4 oz (1 envelope) active dry
           Yeast
  3 1/4 c  Bread, semolina, or unbleach
           All-purpose flour, or a

  1 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      2 c  Whole-wheat flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil as above, or
           Vegetable oil

MMMMM--------------------------CORNMEAL-------------------------------
      1 tb Sugar
      1 c  Warm water as above
      1    Envelope yeast
  2 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose or
           Semolina flour
      1 c  Yellow cornmeal or polenta
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil or vegetable oil

MMMMM--------------------------NEW YORK-------------------------------
      1 c  Warm water as above
      1    Envelope yeast
  3 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is
  110-115 deg F. (When making the New York Variation, omit the sugar and
  proceed as follows). Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently
  until it dissolves, about 1 minute. Let stand in a warm spot until a
  thin layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes. Discard
  mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes.
  
  If making whole-wheat dough, combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use
  as the flour in the directions that follow.
  
  If making the cornmeal dough, combine the flour and cornmeal in a
  bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow.
  
  To mix and knead the dough by hand: Combine 3 cups of the flour with
  the salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center of the
  flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. Using a
  wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in
  the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour
  is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust your hands
  with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press
  down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from
  you, then partially fold it back over itself. Shift it a quarter turn
  and repeat the procedure. While kneading, very gradually add just
  enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer
  sticky or tacky. This should take about 5 minutes. As you work, use a
  metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the
  work surface. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic,
  and springy. Too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the flour
  and results in a tough crust.
  
  After mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and
  place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all
  sides with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent
  moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg
  F) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to
  1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast.
  
  With your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in
  bulk to prevent overrising. Shape it into a ball, pressing out all
  the air bubbles. If you are using bread flour or semolina flour, turn
  the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover again with
  plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy, from 35 minutes to 1
  hour. Omit this step if using all-purpose flour.
  
  If you cannot bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising, punch the
  dough down again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover
  the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The dough can be
  punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours
  before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable. Let chilled
  dough come to room temperature before proceeding.

  instructions on dough-making with a food processor and professional

      2 pk Dry yeast
    2/3 c  Warm water
      2 ts Sugar
      2 c  Cold water
      3 tb Corn oil
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Garlic salt
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Dry oregano leaves
  6 1/2 c  All-purpose flour -- (6 1/2
           To 7)
 
  Sprinkle yeast over warm water and stir in the sugar. Let stand about
  5 minutes or until very bubbly. Combine the remaining ingredients
  with about half of the flour, beating to asmooth batter. Beat in the
  yeast mixture and then with a sturdy spoon work in remaining flour
  until you can toss it lightly on a floured surface and knead it until
  it feels elastic in texture. The kneading may require abaout 2/3 cup
  additional flour, that you will be coating your hand with as you
  knead the dough. Don't let the dough become too stiff and yet you
  don't want it to stick to your hands. Place it in a large plastic
  food bag, which you can spray inside with Pam or wipe the inside of
  it with oil and place the ball of kneaded douogh in this to rise
  until doubled in bulk. Be sure the plastic bag is large enough that
  it will permit the dough to double without splitting the bag. You can
  placethe bag of dough on a warm, sunny spot on the table or kitchen
  counter which helps it to raise quickly and if it's summertime, place
  the bag of dough (with open  end sealed tightly with tape) in your
  car with the windows up! When dough  has doubled, punch it down and
  shape it to fit two 15" round pizza pans that have been greased and
  dusted in cornmeal. Add the sauce and topping  ingredients exactly in
  the order listed above, spreading each ingredients  evenly over the
  dough. Let this rise about 20 minutes in a warm place and then bake
  at 450~, about 20 to 25 minutes, putting one pizza at a time on
  center rack of the preheated oven. If you don't want a pizza-pizza
  and you can only handle one of them,wrap the second pizza in foil or
  plastic and  seal it with tape to lock out all air. Freeze it before
  it rises the last  time. After letting it thaw 30 ,omites, you can
  bake as directed above. Source: Gloria Pitzer's Secret Fast Food

      Title: PIZZA HUT CRUST
 Categories: Pork, Bar-b-q
      Yield: 2 15" crusts
 
      2 pk Dry yeast
    2/3 c  Water (warm)
      2 ts Sugar
      2 c  Water (cold)
      3 tb Corn oil
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Garlic salt
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Dry oregono leaves
  6 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
 
  Sprinkle yeast over warm water and stir in the sugar. Let stand about
  5 minutes or until very bubbly.  Combine the remaining ingredients
  with about half of the flour, beating to a smooth batter. Beat in the
  yeast mixture and then with a sturdy spoon work in remaining flour
  until you can toss it lightly on a floured surface and knead it until
  it feels elastic in texture. The kneading may require abaout 2/3 cup
  additional flour, that you will be coating your hand with as you
  knead the dough. Don't let the dough become too stiff and yet you
  don't want it to stick to your hands. Place it in a large plastic
  food bag, which you can spray inside with Pam or wipe the inside of
  it with oil and place the ball of kneaded douogh in this to rise
  until doubled in bulk. Be sure the plastic bag is large enough that
  it will permit the dough to double without splitting the bag. You can
  place the bag of dough on a warm, sunny spot on the table or kitchen
  counter which helps it to raise quickly and if it's summertime, place
  the bag of dough (with open end sealed tightly with tape) in your car
  with the windows up! When dough has doubled, punch it down and shape
  it to fit two 15" round pizza pans that have been greased and dusted
  in cornmeal. Add the sauce and topping ingredients exactly in the
  order listed above, spreading each ingredients evenly over the dough.
  Let this rise about 20 minutes in a warm place and then bake at 450~,
  about 20 to 25 minutes, putting one pizza at a time on center rack of
  the preheated oven. If you don't want a pizza-pizza and you can only
  handle one of them, wrap the second pizza in foil or plastic and seal
  it with tape to lock out all air. Freeze it before it rises the last
  time. After letting it thaw 30 mintes, you can bake as directed above.

  to form a flat round, then place in a greased 12-inch pizza pan.
  Sprinkel dough with extra virgin olive oil. 6. Pour preferred topping
  over pizza dough and bake in oven preheated to 220C(450F) until

  :         minutes to proof (froth forms on top). Meanwhile, sift
  :         together into a large bowl the white flour, wheat flour,
  :         corn meal and salt. Make a depression in the middle and
  :         add 3 Ts of the olive oil and 1 c warm water.
  :         Add yeast mixture. Mix all ingredients with your hands and
  :         gather together and place on floured board. Knead about 10
  :         minutes, adding more flour if dough is sticky, to form a
  :         smooth, elastic mass. Grease a large bowl with olive oil.
  :         Add dough, turning it to coat top. Cover and let rise in
  :         warm place, draft-free location until doubled in size (45
  :         minutes for fast rising yeast, 1 1.2 hours for regular).
  :         While dough is rising make sauce by melting butter in a
  :         saute pan. Add garlic and saute for one minute. Add
  :         tomatoes and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add

  :         divide into 6 equal pieces and, on floured surface, roll
  :         out to desired shape about 1/2 inch thick. Coat both sides
  :         of shaped crust with olive oil, then place on grill
  :         directly over fire until upper surface begins to bubble
  :         (about 2 minutes). Fire must be very hot and grill must be
  :         clean (coals should be red with a small flame, like a
  :         steak fire; this is important). Watch crust closely and
  :         rotate with spatula if necessary. Remove crust and turn
  :         cooked side up (it should be golden brown). Brush with
  :         olive oil, sauce, cheese and desired toppings. Sprinkle
  :         some olive oil over each pizza. Return for final cooking
  :         (2-4 minutes), rotating for even cooking.

      Title: PIZZA ON THE GRILL - PIZZA DOUGH <R T>
 Categories: Main dish, Eat-lf mail, Low fat
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
        1 pk Active Baker's Yeast
        1 c  Warm Water -- 105 - 115 Deg
  :       pn Salt
    2 1/4 ts Kosher Salt
      1/4 c  White Cornmeal --
  :          Fine-Ground
        3 TB Whole-Wheat Flour
        1 TB Olive Oil
    2 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour -- To 3
      1/2    C,
  :          Unbleached
  
  Dissolve yeast in the warm water with sugar.
  
  After 5 minutes, stir in salt, cornmeal, whole-wheat flour, and oil.
  
  Gradually add all-purpose flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until a
  stiff dough has formed.
  
  Place the dough on a floured board, and knead for several minutes,
  adding only enough additional flour to keep dough from sticking.
  
  When dough is smooth, transfer to a greased bowl.  To prevent,
  transfer to a greased bowl. To prevent a skin from forming, brush top
  of dough with additional olive oil, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and
  let rise in warm place, away from drafts, until doubled, 1 1/2 to
        2    hrs.
  
  Punch down dough.  Knead dough several times on lightly floured board.
  Return dough to bowl; cover and let rise 40 min.
  
  Punch down dough.  If sticky, knead in a bit more flour.
  
  Makes enough for four 12 inch pizzas.
  
  Well, as usual...I don't follow directions.  I didn't do them on the
  grill but in my oven.  I cooked them at 475 deg F for 15 min. The
  dough was probably the lightest and best that I have **ever** eaten.
  I topped one with tomatoes, sweet anise, 1 T slivered almonds
  crushed, and sauteed zucchini.  Topped another with the Mushrooms
  with Mint and Lemon recipe I posted earlier in the week. I gave half
  of the dough to Sally (my friend) and she cooked them for dinner with
  her toppings.

  1 1/4 c  Milk; plus
      2 tb Milk; (if needed)
      2 tb Olive Oil
      1 tb Rosemary; chopped
      2 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      3 c  Flour
      2 ts Yeast

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lb Ricotta Cheese
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Romano Cheese; grated
      1 tb Parsley; chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
     15 sl Salami; thinly sliced
     25    Basil Leaves; coarsely
           -chopped
     16 oz Roasted Red Peppers; drained
     12 sl Provolone Cheese; thinly
           -sliced
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Place all dough ingredients in pan and program for knead and first
  rise. The dough will be firm and pull away from the side of the
  machine. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. In mixing
  bowl, whisk together all the ingredients and refrigerate until you
  are ready to assemble the pizza. Preheat the oven to 400øF. with the
  rack in the center position. Grease a 9" springform pan.
  
  When the dough cycle is completed transfer the dough to a lightly
  floured work surface, cover it with a clean towel, and let it rest
  for 5 minutes. Cut the dough in 2 pieces; one piece should be one
  third of the dough and the other piece should be 2/3.  Roll out the
  larger piece to a 14" circle. Line the springform pan with the
  circle. A small amount of dough (1") should overlap the top of the
  pan. Arrange 5 slices of salami on the bottom. Spread a third of the
  ricotta filling over the salami, then sprinkle on a third of the
  basil. Lay out a third of the peppers. Lay out 4 slices of provolone.
  Repeat this pattern for the next 2 layers. Roll out the small piece
  of dough to a 9" circle. Brush water around the rim of the dough
  already in pan, then fit the 9" circle on top. Trim away about 1/2"
  of the overlapping dough from the bottom circle. Crimp together the
  top and bottom edges. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil and
  salt and pepper. With a pair of scissors, cut a vent in the top crust
  about 1" in diameter. Bake for 15 minutes at 400øF., then at 350øF.
  for 15 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately remove
  the sides of the springform. Cool before slicing to allow layers to
  set.

  Crust:
  
  Pour  the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve the yeast
  with a fork. Add 1 c of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt, and, and
  vegetable oil. Mix well with a spoon. Continue stirring in the rest
  of the flour 1/2 c at a time,  until  the dough comes away from the
  sides of the bowl. Flour your hands and the work surface and kneed
  the ball of dough until it is no longer sticky.
  
  Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic wrap, for 45
  to 60 minutes in a warm place, until it is doubled in bulk. Punch it
  down and kneed it briefly. Press it into an oiled 15-inch deep dish
  pizza pan, until it comes 2 inches  up the sides and is even on the
  bottom of the pan. Let the  dough rise 15-20 minutes before filling.
  
  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
  
  While  the  dough  is rising, prepare  the  filling. Cook the crumbled
  sausage until it is no longer pink, drain it of its excess fat. Drain
  and chop the tomatoes.
  
  When  the dough has finished its second rising, lay the cheese over
  the dough shell. Then distribute the sausage and garlic over the
  cheese. Top with the tomatoes. Sprinkle on the seasonings and
  parmesan cheese.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes at 500 degrees. Then lower the temperature to 400
  degrees and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up a section of the
  crust from time to time with a spatula to check on its color. The
  crust will be golden brown when done.  Serve immediately.

  The aroma of charcoal broiling squid to perfection attracts customers
  to the street stalls of many of the cities and small towns in the
  southern region of Thailand. The flavor would be enhanced by any
  number of dipping sauces.

  leaving the tentacles intact. Remove the skin.
  
  Place on a rack and charcoal-broil for 2 minutes on each side. Brush
  with the combined fish sauce and soy sauce during broiling to add
  color and more flavor.
  
  Mix together the sauce ingredients and pour into a bowl. Cut the
  cooked squid into 1 inch pieces and serve with the dipping sauce.

  While I was in Southeast Asia, I tasted a wonderful broiled flounder,
  topped with a sweet-and-sour sauce of pineapple, cucumber, tomato and
  onion. For spice, I've added lots of fresh ginger and garlic. Serve
  the fish in shallow bowls, with the sauce ladled atop.
  
  1. Carefully remove any tiny bones from flounder with a tweezer. Set
  fish on a broiler tray lined with aluminum foil. Preheat broiler.
  
  2. Combine diced pineapple, cucumber, tomatoes, onions and pineapple
  juice in a heavy saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  3. Reduce heat, add garlic and ginger, season with salt and continue
  cooking for another 5 minutes.
  
  4. Remove 1/4 cup of liquid from saucepan and mix it with cornstarch
  until smooth. Stir back into saucepan and cook, stirring, 2 minutes
  more to thicken fruit sauce slightly. Remove from heat; set aside.
  
  5. Brush fish fillets with olive oil and drizzle with lime juice.
  Sprinkle with salt. Place fish 4" from heat source and broil 4-5
  minutes, or until fish is opaque and flakes easily. Remove, cut in
  half crosswise and place one piece of fish in each of 8 shallow bowls.
  
  6. Heat fruit sauce for 1 minute over medium heat, stir in cilantro

  Combine butter with hot cooked noodles, Add eggs and stir until

  lighter taller kugel..beat whites first; but I never do! This is the
  good old fashioned way of serving what's   'bad' for you but tastes

      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
    1/2 oz Yeast (dry),
           -quick-rising
           -(2 envelopes)
    1/4 c  Water, lukewarm
      7 tb Milk, dry
  2 1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      6 c  Flour, all-purpose
 
  In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in about 1/4 cup lukewarm water.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, mix the powdered milk, sugar, salt and about
  1 3/4 cups water together.  Stir with a whisk until smooth, then add
  yeast mixture.
  
  Sift in about 3 cups of flour and mix until smooth. Add the oil; mix.
  
  Gradually sift in the remaining flour.  When it becomes stiff enough
  to handle remove from the bowl and knead it as you add the flour.
  Knead it for 5-7 minutes after the last flour is added.
  
  Place the dough in a oiled bowl and turn it over to coat uniformly.
  Then place it in a warm place to rise until it has doubled in size
  (about 45 minutes).
  
  Remove from bowl and knead a little.  Divide into two equal parts,
  shape into loaves, and place in loaf pans. Let rise again until
  doubled in size.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Bake 45 minutes. Remove loaves from
  pans and cool on a wire rack.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Ordinary white bread -- This recipe is derived from the basic
  bread in the American Heart Association Cookbook.
  
  *  This is good everyday bread.  Be careful:  it's easy to eat too
  much and get fat.  You may want to have someone who has made bread
  before help the first time as the amount of flour may have to be
  adjusted depending on the slight differences in your measurement of
  the liquids and the humidity of the day. Once you have done it it is
  easy to do by the feel of the dough.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.

      2 tb Powdered milk
      1 tb Sugar;  (if you have trouble
           - with raising try 2)
      1 tb Margarine; or olive oil
  1 1/2 ts Powdered yeast
 
  When the ABM starts look inside and watch the dough it should be just
  one big ball that is fairly soft, if its sticky and gooshy you have
  to add more flour. If there is still flour laying around and its as
  hard as a brick you have to add water. You have to do this with just
  about every NEW recipe until you get the right combination for your
  machine, flour, and climate.
  
  First thing you need to do is get some bread flour (there is a
  difference) and get some yeast in bulk. Do not use the little
  packages they are just to expensive. Most of the big warehouse clubs
  carry yeast in bigger packages.
  
  If this don't work get back to us and tell us what is going on.

      Title: PLAIN WHITE RICE
 Categories: Rice, Wok
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
      2 c  Rice
           Water
 
  PLace two cups of dry rice in a pot which has a very well-fitting
  cover. Wash the rice in cold water, rubbing the rice with your hands
  to remove excess starch. Pour starchy water out, rinse rice with cold
  water. Wash and rinse rice a second time. Add enough water to cover
  the rice to a depth of 1/2-3/4". If you like your rice fluffy, add
  3/4" of water. If you like your rice drier, then use less water.
  Place lid over rice pot. Allow the rice to stand in the pot 1/2 hour
  before cooking.
  
  1. Turn the burner of your stove on the highest setting. Place pot of
  rice over it. Allow rice to come to a full boil. Allow it to boil for
  about 4-5 minutes. Then turn the flame of the burner down to the
  medium setting. Allow the rice to boil a further 5 minutes. UNDER NO
  CIRCUMSTANCES should you lift up the cover to peer at the rice, as
  this causes the steam inside the pot to disperse. For this reason
  your resultant rice may come out raw at the top.
  
  2. After cooking rice on medium heat for 5 minutes, reduce your burner
  flame to its lowest point and allow rice to steam 15 minutes or more.
  NOW cook whatever wok dish or dishes that you wish to serve with the
  rice.
  
  3. Just before serving time, take a large spoon and fluff rice up.
  
  NOTE: Do not be alarmed if some of the water and steam foam out of
  the pot, this is a part of rice cookery.

      Title: PLAINEST ITALIAN SAUSAGE
 Categories: Meats, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8    Foot of sausage casing,
           - packed in salt
  1 1/2 lb Boneless pork
    1/2 lb Fresh pork fat
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 ts Fennel seeds
           - lightly crushed
      2 tb Dry red wine
 
  SCRAPE THE LOOSE SALT OFF the sausage casing and set the casing in a
  bowl of cold water to soften for at least 30 minutes. (You will need
  only about 4 feet of casing for this amount of meat, but it's useful
  to have extra in case of ruptures.) Cut the pork and fat into pieces
  that will go through your meat grinder and grind them, using the
  coarse blade. Mix the salt, pepper and fennel seeds thoroughly into
  the ground meat. (Hands are the best implement.) Then mix in the
  wine. Drain the casing, open one end gently with your fingers and run
  a stream of cold water into it, to flush any remaining salt out of
  the interior. Thread the casing onto the stuffing horn and fit the
  horn over the meat grinder. Feed the sausage meat through the horn,
  supporting the emerging tube of sausage with your hands to prevent
  rips. (Actually, sausage making is much more conveniently done with
  two people.) When all the sausage meat is in the casing, lay the
  filled tube on the work surface and pinch it at 4-inch intervals to
  produce individual sausage links. At the same time, fill and firm any
  air pockets in the casing. Tie off the links with kitchen string.
  Coil the sausages onto a plate and set it, uncovered, in the
  refrigerator to season for 48 hours. Turn the sausages over once or
  twice during that time.

    1/4 ts Pepper -- ground black
      1 c  Cold refried black beans --
           Canned
      3    Plantain ripe -- unpeeled
      1    Banana ripe -- peeled
      1 ts Salt
      2    Scallion -- sliced thin
    1/4 c  Peanut oil
      1 c  Crema recipe follows
    1/4 c  Anejo, Romano or Feta Cheese
           Grated
    1/4 c  Manchego or Feta cheese --
           Grated
           Creme Fraiche or sour cream
           Garnish
 
  Preheat the oven to 350F Cut a lenghthwise slit in each plaintain and
  set it on a baking sheet. Bake until the flesh is thoroughly soft and
  oozing through the slit, 40 to 50 minutes, set aside to cool.
  Meanwhile, make the stuffing: Finely dice the poblano chile. Combine
  with beans, scallions, cheeses, and pepper in a mixing bowl and stir
  to combine. The stuffing can be made up to a day in advance and
  reserved in the refrigerator. Make the dough in a food processor or
  in a mixer with a paddle attachment: Peel, trim and discard any tough
  ends from the plantains. Combine the plantains, banana and salt and
  pulse until a smooth puree is formed, or mix until just blended. Be
  careful not to overwork the dough, or it will become too starchy.
  Wrap in plastic and chill about 2 hours. To assemble the empanadas,
  roll 2 tablespoons of the dough lightly between your palms to form a
  ball. Line the bottom of a tortilla press with a small plastic bag
  and place the ball of dough in the center. Place another small bag
  over the dough and press to form a 3 1/2 inch circle. (If you do not
  have a tortilla press, the dough can be flattened with the palm of
  your hand on a counter, with a sheet of plastic above and below to
  prevent sticking.) Place about 1 teaspoon of the bean stuffing on
  half of the dough circle and fold overto enclose, pressing the edges
  to seal. Place the stuffed empanadas on a platter and chill at least
  30 minutes or as long as a day. (Stuffed empanadas can also be
  frozen.) To cook the empanadas, heat the peanut oil in a medium
  skillet over medium-high heat. Fry 4 to 6 empanadas, at a time,
  shaking the pan constantly, about 1 minute per side or untildark
  brown all over. If they darken too quickly, as they may if very ripe
  plantains were used,. lower the flame slightly.) Drain on paper
  towels. Serve hot with Crema, Creme Fraiche or sour cream for dipping.

      Title: PLAN SAMLI DAET DIAO (FRIED SUN-DRIED KINGFIS
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Kingfish, weighing 1 to 1
           -1/2 lbs.
      1 tb Finely sliced shallot
      2 tb Shredded green mango
      1 ts Shredded hot chilli
      2 tb Fish sauce
      3 tb Lime juice
      1 ts Palm sugar
      2 c  Cooking oil
 
  Snagged an excellent new Thai cookbook yesterday. It's "The Elegant
  Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon Kongpan and Pinyo
  Srisawat. SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989. ISBN
  0-943389-05-4. This is a big, well-illustrated-with-color-photos
  book. Mike hauled it home yesterday with another one, "Keo's Thai
  Cuisine". (Being no dummy, he realizes that new cookbooks inspire me
  to cook so every so often he'll grab something for me to avoid having
  to cook himself.) But it wasn't that simple. He'd bought them both,
  but intended to keep one and send one on as a thank-you gift to a
  fella that took him and Laurie sailing a couple of weeks ago.
  
  "You get to choose one to keep." The dreaded words...
  
  I paled, started to shake.  Sweat beaded my brow.  I grabbed the
  fanciest one++the hardbound "Keo's" book++and paged through it, awed
  by the illustrations, impressed by the recipes. Then I grabbed
  "Elegant Taste" and started on the first page, intending to skip
  through it. Instead I went through the entire book, page by page,
  from start to finish. I slammed it shut.  "This one."
  
  "Elegant Taste" explains Thai ingredients (and gives both the Thai
  names and spells them out using the Thai alphabet), makes sensible
  recommendations for substitutions and has relatively simple but very
  good and authentic looking recipes, each of which is illustrated by a
  beautiful color photo.  This can be really helpful when one is
  cooking a new dish and isn't sure of what it should look like and
  what garnishes to use. Garnishes are particularly important in Thai
  cooking as they're meant to be eaten with the dish but often are not
  referred to in the recipe. For instance, in the following recipe the
  dish is presented on a platter with a half dozen or so scallion
  brushes and tomato slices, neither of which are referred to in the
  recipe.
  
  As for this recipe, some of you might remember a while back when I was
  raving about a dried, fried fish dish I'd had in a Thai place, but
  couldn't find in a cookbook. It was in "Elegant Taste" and here it
  is. Wash, clean and butterfly the fish leaving the two sides joined
  along the belly. Open the fish out flat so that the skin is downward,
  remove the bones, and score the flesh with a knife.
  
  After allowing it to dry, lay the fish opened out flat in strong
  sunshine for five to six hours, turning regularly so the sun strikes
  both the skin side and the interior.
  
  Pour the oil into a deep frying pan and place on medium heat. When
  the oil is hot, place the fish, still opened out, in the oil. When
  the lower side becomes crisp and golden, turn the fish and continue
  frying until it is done on both sides; then, remove from the pan,
  drain, place on a serving dish.
  
  Toss the shallots, mango and chilli together, seasoning with fish
  sauce, lime juice and palm sugar so that a sour taste is the
  predominant one. Spoon into a bowl and serve with the fish.
  
  Serves two to three.
  
  From "The Elegant Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon
  Kongpan and Pinyo Srisawat.  SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989.
  ISBN 0- 943389-05-4.
  
  This dish is very savoury with a crunchy/chewy texture. The version I
  had in the restaurant still had bones but was so well fried that I
  just munched up the bones and all.
  
  Incidentally, I'm going to buy the "Keo's" book as well. It looks
  quite good too but seems to be tailored more toward Western kitchens.
  For instance, it calls for brown sugar rather than palm sugar in most
  recipes. Now that's a perfectly adequate substitution, but why bother
  when I have palm sugar on hand? (Smug grin.)

      Title: PLANKED FISH
 Categories: Seafood, Fish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
  You will need some wood shingles.  You can get them at any hardware
  store. Make sure they are cedar or pecan or some other hardwood. Not
  pine or something that will give the fish a turpentine taste. Get one
  for every serving planned.  And extra for later. Soak the shingles in
  water for a couple of hours. I recommend using fish fillets for this
  recipe as they will cook more evenly. Prepare the fish fillets, using
  whatever spices you like, salt and pepper.
  
  Remove the shingles from the water and pat dry.  Oil one side lightly
  in the center where the fish will go. Place one piece of fish in the
  center of each shingle. Then you will place the whole shingle, fish
  and all on a hot grill or over a charcoal fire close enough to the
  heat that the plank will smoke.  It is best to have a heat source
  with a cover. Leave the plank on the heat source long enough for the
  fish to cook, until it flakes easily. The plank will start to char on
  the bottom and edges, this is what smokes the fish while it cooks,
  this is ok. Serve the fish on the plank. This recipe is great for the
  outdoors where a homemade camp "oven" can be used, no plates
  necessary and totally biodegradable. Walt MM

  occaisions, it may be served with a small spoonful of butter (or
  maragarine) in the centre. In the pot, melt the butter and when it is
  foamy, add the onion and fry until golden. Add everything else to the
  pot except the last cup of water and the sour cream and parsley
  garnishes. simmer, covered, for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the
  potatoes and carrots are tender. Run it all through the blender,
  about 1 to 1 1/2 cups at a time. When it is all pureed, rinse the
  cooking pot with the cup of water and add that to the 'empty'
  blender. Run the blender for a few seconds and then slosh the water
  about to get as much of the vegetable puree as possible off the sides
  of the blender. Add this liquid to the soup. Pour the soup back into
  the cleaned out pot and reheat it before serving (use very gentle

  using the blade of a knife to help you get started.
       With a rubber spatula, spread mustard over the surface of the
  dough and sprinkle with cheese. (The tart can be prepared ahead to
  this point. Wrap and freeze for up to 2 months. Do not thaw before
  continuing.) Arrange tomato slices on top in 5 rows of 8 slices each.
  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Let
  cool in the pan for 5 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the remaining
  1 Tbsp. olive oil, parsley, garlic and thyme. With your fingers or a
  fork, dab some of the herb mixture onto each tomato slice. Slide the
  tart onto a serving platter or, if you wish to serve bite-sized
  appetizers, slide it onto a cutting board and with a sharp knife or
  pizza cutter, cut the tart into squares between the tomato slices.
  Serve warm or at room temperature.

      Title: PO VALLEY PUMPKIN PIE
 Categories: Italian, Desserts, Pies
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/8 ts Salt
      5 tb Unsalted butter
      1 lg Egg
           FOR THE PUMPKIN FILLING
      1    Fresh pumpkin, about 2
           -pounds, OR 1 can
           Solid-pack pumpkin (1 pound)
    1/4 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Sugar
      1 ts Grund cinnamom
      2 lg Eggs
      1 c  Almonds, ground
    1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
    1/2 c  Candied orange peel
      4 tb Unsalted butter, melted
 
  FOR THE PASTA FROLLA:
  
  For the Pasta Frolla:  Combine the dry ingredients and mix well. Rub
  in the butter until it is absorbed, making sure the mixture remains
  cool and powdery and does not become pastry. Beat the egg and stir in
  with a fork. Continue stirring until the dough holds together, then
  knead it briefly, just until smooth. Shape into a disk, wrap in
  plastic, and regrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until firm.
  
  For the Pumpkin Filling:  Cut the pumpkin into 2-inch dice, scrape
  away the filaments from the inside and peel off the skin. Steam the
  pumpkin over simmering water for about 40 minutes, until it is
  tender. Puree the pumpkin in a blender or a food processor fitted
  with a metal blade; cool. If the pumpkin puree is excessively watery,
  cook it, stirring constantly, over medium heat, preferably in a
  nonstick pan, to dry it out before proceeding.
  
  Measure 2 cups of the pumpkin puree (a little more or less won't
  matter) into a large mixing bowl.  Whisk in the salt, sugar,
  cinnamon, and eggs, one at a time. Combine the ground almonds and
  cornmeal and stir into the pumpkin mixture.  Place the candied orange
  peel in a strainer, rinse under cold, running water, and chop it
  finely with a sharp knife. (Oil the blade of the knife to prevent it
  from sticking to the peel.) Stir the chopped peel into the filling,
  then fold in the melted butter.
  
  To Assemble the Pie:  Roll the dough out on a floured surface into a
  large disk, about 14 inches in diameter. Fold the disk of dough in
  half and fit it into a buttered 9-by-2-inch deep layer cake pan.
  Press the dough against the bottom and sides of the pan and trim the
  edges so they are even with the top of the pan. Pour in the filling
  and spread it evenly. The filling will be about 1/2-inch lower than
  the top of the pan. Fold the excess dough at the rim inward so that
  it makes a border about 1/2-inch wide at the edge.
  
  Bake the pie in the lower third of a preheated 350 F oven for about 45
  minutes, until the filling is set and the dough is a light golden
  color. Cool the pie in the pan on a rack. When the pie is completely
  cooled, place a flat plate or pan on top and invert.  Lift off the
  baking pan and replace it with a platter.  Invert again and remove
  the top plate or pan. Keep the pie loosely covered at room
  temperature before serving.
  
  Makes 10 servings.

 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 lg Firm Apples
      1 c  Maple syrup
    1/2 c  Water
      1 tb Butter
      1 ts All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Light cream or
           -half-and-half
           -Pare and core apples.
 
  In a saucepan, combine the syrup and water. Bring to a boil and
  simmer 3 minutes. Add the apples and cover. Simmer until the apples
  are tender but not mushy, 3 to 8 minutes. With slotted spoon, lift
  the apples onto individual dessert dihes or plates. Boil syrup until
  reduced to 3/4 cup. Pour syrup into a measuring cup. melt butter in
  the saucepan. Blend in the flour, cream and the syrup. Boil,
  uncovered, until reduced to 1 cup, about 3 minutes. Serve warm, or at
  room temperature. *NOTE- Because the apples are pared before cooking,
  they will cook very quickly. Certain varieties might even get mushy
  all of a sudden. Watch them VERY carefully while cooking; it just
  takes minutes. This dessert is delicious and beatiful when you serve
  one whole apple on a plate surrounded with the maple-and-cream sauce.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------POACHED EGGS MASSENA-------------------------
      4 lg Artichokes
    1/2    Lemon
           Salt
           Bearnaise sauce (see below)

MMMMM----------------------BEARNAISE SAUCE---------------------------
    2/3 c  Dry white wine
    1/3 c  Tarragon vinegar
      3 tb Shallots, minced
      2 tb Fresh tarragon, chopped
    1/2 ts White pepper
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter (1 stick)
      3    Egg yolks
           Salt and cayenne pepper
      4    Whole eggs
      2 qt Water
      1 tb Wine vinegar
 
  Artichoke Preparation: Cut the stems and most of the leaves off the
  artichoke. With a paring knife, whittle off the leaves at the base to
  expose the heart. Scrape the fibrous "choke" to leave only the
  disk-shaped heart.  Rub the heart with lemon. Cook with salted
  boiling water for about 8 minutes.  Drain and refresh with cold
  water. Set aside. Bearnaise Sauce: In a heavy saucepan, combine wine,
  tarragon vinegar, shallots, fresh tarragon and white pepper.  Boil to
  reduce to 3 tablespoons. Let cool. Meanwhile, melt the butter; cool
  slightly. Add egg yolks to vinegar mixture and cook over low heat,
  whisking constantly, for 1 minute or until the consistancy of
  mayonnaise. Do not overcook or it will curdle. Whisk in the warm
  melted butter in a thin stream into the wine mixture. The sauce will
  thicken. Whisk in salt, cayenne and white pepper to taste. Keep warm
  in a pan of warm water. Poach the 4 eggs 3 minutes in 2 quarts of
  water and 1 tablespoon wine vinegar. Remove with a slotted spoon and
  trim edges. Keep in warm water. To assemble, heat the artichoke
  hearts and blot dry. Spoon a bit of the Bearnaise Sauce into each
  heart. Place a poached egg on top and spoon more sauce over. Serve at
  once.

      Title: POACHED EGGS WITH CHIPOTLE SAUCE
 Categories: Mexican, Eggs, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    To 2 dried chipotles or
           -mora chiles
    1/4 c  Water or chicken stock
      2 tb Shallots, minced
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Flour
    1/2 ts Dried sage
      1 ts Dried thyme
  1 2/3 c  Chicken broth
    1/2 c  Cream
           Salt to taste
     12    Eggs
           Pan de Maiz (see recipe)
 
  This sounds like a dandy brunch item.  Chipotle peppers are *very*
  hot, so be warned...
  
  Before you begin preparing everything else, pour boiling water over
  chipotle or mora chiles.  Cover and let soak for at least 1 hour. When
  chiles are well softened, puree them in a food processor with 1/4 cup
  w or chicken broth.
  
  Meanwhile, saute shallots in olive oil until softened. Then add flour
  and cook until lightly brown.  Stir in the herbs and slowly whisk in
  the chicken broth. Simmer for 5 minutes and then add the cream.
  
  Simmer sauce for 15 minutes or until slightly reduced. Cream will
  thicken. Add 2 teaspoons of the chipotle puree and simmer for 5
  minutes longer to concentrate flavors. If you want more chipotle
  flavor, you may add more puree at this point.  Be careful, it's
  picante. Taste, and add salt, if necessary.
  
  Poach or lightly fry the eggs.
  
  Cut corn bread into 6 large squares.  Put a square on each plate.
  Place cooked eggs on top of corn bread and ladle on about 1/3 cup of
  Chipotle Sauce per serving.
  
  These eggs are great accompanied by black beans, turkey sausages and a
  fresh fruit compote to cool down the palate.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  Reserve leftover chipotle puree for another recipe. Or blend
  with olive mayonnaise and dash of lime juice and use as a sandwich
  spread.

      Title: POACHED FOWL & BACON WITH 'PUDDING'
 Categories: Medieval, Main dish, Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lb Boiling fowl with
           Neck and giblets
      2 tb Finely chopped mixed fresh
           Savory, parsley, hyssop and
           Sage
           Salt and pepper
  1 1/2 lb Piece boiling bacon
      2 c  Strong dry cider
           Extra herbs to garnish
           Pudding
           Neck, liver and heart
           From the bird
      1 ts Of the herb mixture above
           Salt and pepper
      8 tb Soft white breadcrumbs
      1    Egg beaten
 
  This was a cheap and easy dish on which youngsters could practise when
  learning to carve poultry. Ask a kindly poulterer to cut off the
  bird's head and to supply the whole neck in its skin along with the
  prepared bird and giblets.  Mix the herbs together and put a
  tablespoonful aside. Add a light seasoning of salt and pepper to the
  rest and fill the mixture into the body cavity of the bird. Stitch or
  skewer the cavity openings securely. Truss the bird for boiling and
  place it on a trivet in a stewpan which will also hold the bacon and
  liquids. To prepare the neck, ease the spine and surrounding flesh
  out of the skin as if peeling off a stocking. Do not break the skin.
  Chop the liver and heart finely and mix with half the reserved herbs,
  a little seasoning and the breadcrumbs. Bind with the egg. Fill this
  mixture into the skin, allowing room for the bread to swell. Fasten
  the ends of the sausage-shaped 'pudding' securely and add to the pan.
  (If the skin is accidentally torn, or is not supplied, you can make
  the stuffing into small balls and fry or bake them, as an acceptable
  substitute.) Mix the cider with 425 ml/15 fl oz/2 cups water and heat
  until nearly boiling. Add the liquid to the pan, put on a
  well-fitting lid and poach the bird gently for 2-2 1/2 hours. Add the
  bacon piece after 30 minutes and the stuffed neck after a further 15
  minutes. Top up the pan with extra boiling water then, or later if
  needed. Test the bird for readiness after 2 hours by thrusting a thin
  skewer into the thickest part of the thigh.  The juices should run
  clear. A smallish bird may be almost ready by this time, and the
  bacon piece should be done. Take the bacon out, with the 'pudding',
  and leave both to rest for 10-15 minutes. The slice both to serve as
  a garnish for the poached bird. Scatter a few extra herb leaves over
  the breast of the bird before serving. First stuff your capons with
  saveray, With parsley, a little, hissop I say; Then take the neck,
  remove the bone; And make a pudding thereof at once With an egg and
  minced bread also With hacked liver and heart thereto... Then boil
  the capon, as I they say, With parsley, sage, hissop, saveray... With
  slices of bacon embrawded here and colour your broth with saffron
  dear... (Mrs Groundes-Peace's Old Cookery Notebook)

 Categories: Fruit
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Water
      4 sl Lemon
  1 1/2 pt Ground cherries
 
  "Surprisingly little known nowadays, ground-cherries used to be one
  of the more common fruits and still are one of the more delicious.
  They grow wild throughout a great part of the courty and are
  cultivated in Pennsylvania and the West. In Europe, where there are
  different types -- they all belong to the genus Physalis -- they are
  eaten raw and used for compotes. In Australia, where the larger ones
  are called Cape gooseberries, they are canned and shipped to the rest
  of the world. Ground-cherries make wonderful pocket fruit, for each
  one is securely packed in its own little husk. When eaten raw they
  are refreshingly sweet and rich. It is mystifying to me that they are
  not more prized."
  
  Combine the sugar and water, bring to a boil, and boil 8 to 10
  minutes. Add the lemon and ground-cherries and cook 5 minutes, at a
  rolling boil, removing any scum that forms. Reduce heat, and simmer
  until the ground-cherries are just cooked through, about 12 minutes
  in all. Cool in the syrup. Serve as a topping for ice cream, or serve
  warm over sponge cake or angel cake with whipped cream.

 Categories: Fish, Low-fat, Low-cal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS
  1 1/2 lb Fresh tomatoes (about 3 med)
      3 tb White onion; grated
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Orange marmalade
      2 tb Brandy
      2 ts Whole coriander; crushed
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
        pn Cayenne
  1 1/4 lb Orange roughy fillets
           Lemon wedges (1 per serving)
 
  Cut the unpeeled tomatoes in half crosswise, squeeze out the seed
  pockets, and cut out the stem ends.  Dice the tomatoes and place in a
  saucepan with the onion and salt. Cook over medium heat, 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally.  Add the marmalade and brandy and continue to
  cook, 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the coriander, cinnamon,
  and cayenne and cook 5 minutes longer, stirring frequently.
  
  Meanwhile, rinse the fish.  Place it in a skillet large enough to
  hold it in a single layer and add enough water to just cover the
  fish. Remove the fish and set aside. Bring the water to a boil over
  high heat, reduce heat to medium, and add the fish in a single layer.
  Bring back to a simmer, cover, and poach 3 to 5 minutes, depending on
  the thickness of the fish. Fish is done when mostly opaque but still
  barely translucent at the very center.  Remove from the poaching
  liquid, draining off as much water as possible.  Place on a platter
  and drain again.  Pour the hot tomato orange marmalade over the fish,
  garnish with lemon wedges, and serve immediately.

      Title: POACHED PEARS
 Categories: Digest, Nov., Holiday, Thanksgivin
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4    Pears, preferably Bosc
      2 ts Fresh lemon juice
      1 c  Cranapple juice
 
  Halve, peel, and core the pears. Sprinkle freshly cut pears with lemon
  juice to prevent browning. Place in microwave-safe dish and cover with
  cranapple juice. Cover and cook on high 6 - 8 minutes or until pears
  are fork tender. (Check the pears after 6 minutes; the fresher the
  pears, the longer they'll take to cook.) Spoon juice over pears,
  cover, and let stand 30 minutes or refrigerate overnight.
  
  I love the texture and buttery flavor of poached pears. This microwave
  poaching method is so simple that sometimes I buy a big bag of pears
  and poach them all at once. They can then be refrigerated and covered
  and eaten as snacks throughout the next week. Bosc and Bartlett pears
  are the best varieties for poaching.
  
  This is a nice holiday recipe because the cranberry juice turns the
  pears a pale pink color. These pears are pretty garnished with some
  fresh mint sprigs. This recipe is best made at least 30 minutes in
  advance to give the pears time to cool.

      1 c  Dry white wine
      3 tb Fresh lemon juice

      6    Sprigs fresh dill -- for
           Garnish
           Kohlrabi slaw (see recipe)
 
  Trim roots from leeks, leaving bases intact so leeks do not seperate
  into layers when cut. Halve leeks lengthwise; wash thoroughly under
  running water. Place 2 1/2 quarts water, wine, lemon juice, salt,
  peppercorns, oregano and leeks in a large shallow saucepan. Bring to
  a boil. Reduce heat to medium low; simmer until very flavorful, about
  45 minutes. Meanwhile, slice into one long side of each salmon fillet
  about 3/4 of the way through, forming a pocket. Trim tough bottoms
  from asparagus; cut each spear in half. Arrange ten asparagus halves
  in the pocket of each salmon fillet (parallel to the cut side) in two
  rows of five, facing tips toward center. Press gently to close. Tie
  kitchen string around salmon in two places, so pocket stays closed
  while poaching. Return stock to a boil. Reduce heat so stock is at a
  bare simmer. Add salmon and poach, adjusting heat to maintain a bare
  simmer, for 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer salmon from stockpot to a glass
  or ceramic baking dish. Allow liquid to cool for 5 minutes, then pour
  over salmon; let stand until cool, about 1 hour. Remove salmon from
  liquid; let stand to come toroom temperature, about 45 minutes. Untie
  salmon and slice each fillet widthwise into 1-inch pieces; garnish
  with dill sprigs and serve Kohlrabi Slaw on the side.

     20    Whole asparagus spears
      6    Sprigs fresh dill -- for
           Garnish
           Kohlrabi slaw (see recipe)
 
  Trim roots from leeks, leaving bases intact so leeks do not seperate
  into layers when cut. Halve leeks lengthwise; wash thoroughly under
  running water. Place 2 1/2 quarts water, wine, lemon juice, salt,
  peppercorns, oregano and leeks in a large shallow saucepan. Bring to
  a boil. Reduce heat to medium low; simmer until very flavorful, about
  45 minutes. Meanwhile, slice into one long side of each salmon fillet
  about 3/4 of the way through, forming a pocket. Trim tough bottoms
  from asparagus; cut each spear in half. Arrange ten asparagus halves
  in the pocket of each salmon fillet (parallel to the cut side) in two
  rows of five, facing tips toward center. Press gently to close. Tie
  kitchen string around salmon in two places, so pocket stays closed
  while poaching. Return stock to a boil. Reduce heat so stock is at a
  bare simmer. Add salmon and poach, adjusting heat to maintain a bare
  simmer, for 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer salmon from stockpot to a glass
  or ceramic baking dish. Allow liquid to cool for 5 minutes, then pour
  over salmon; let stand until cool, about 1 hour. Remove salmon from
  liquid; let stand to come toroom temperature, about 45 minutes. Untie
  salmon and slice each fillet widthwise into 1-inch pieces; garnish
  with dill sprigs and serve Kohlrabi Slaw on the side.

      Title: POACHED SALMON WITH LOBSTER BUTTER
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Whole 7-8 lb. salmon
           Salt

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE BUTTER----------------------------
    1/2    Lemon (juice only)
      1    Green-black lobster brain OR
      4 tb Reduced lobster stock *
      6 oz Butter
 
  *Note: Lobster stock should be made from shells and heads, then
  heavily reduced to make 3-4 tablespoons.
  
  Scale, gut and wipe the fish.  Rub the inside cavity with salt. If
  you have a fish kettle, steam the salmon whole over boiling water for
  30-35 minutes (making sure the water is kept topped up).  Or wrap the
  fish in lightly oiled foil and bake it in the oven for an hour at 325
  F (170 C) gas mark 3. Leave it to rest while you make the butter.
  
  Warm the lemon juice in a small basin over a saucepan of simmering
  water. Beat in the nuggets of cold butter, adding more as each one
  melts. Do this gently ~ it can split if you overheat it (revive it
  with a quick splash of cold water).  When you have an unctuous smooth
  sauce like thin cream, sieve and whisk in the green goo from the head
  of the lobster - which immediately turns the butter a wonderful
  orange-pink.
  
  Serve the salmon when it is just cool but still sweet-flavoured and
  full of its own juices, with piping hot baked potatoes and warm
  lobster butter.
