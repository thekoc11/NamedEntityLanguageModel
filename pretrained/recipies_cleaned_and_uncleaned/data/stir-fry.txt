           Root, minced
    1/4 c  Seasoned rice vinegar
      1 T  Hoisin sauce 2 Tbe. water

           Cooked rice, for serving
 
  Salted or not, eggplant does not require much oil for cooking. Here, a
  small amount of oil is heated until hot in a non-stick pan. Then the
  eggplant and vegetables are added to the pan and seared over high heat for
  4 minutes, stirring often to avoid burning. Heat peanut oil and sesame oils
  in 12-inch non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Make sure oil coats bottom
  of pan before adding ingredients. Add eggplant, red onion, zucchini, salt,
  garlic and ginger.  Cook, uncovered, over high heat until eggplant is
  tender but not mushy, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring almost constantly to
  avoid burning. Vegetables should look seared.
  
  Add rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, water and crushed hot pepper. Heat through.
  Add sweet pepper.  Cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Adjust
  seasonings to taste. Serve hot over rice, garnished with sliced green
  onions. FROM: L.A. Times Food Section

      Title: Mu Shu Pork #3
 Categories: Pork, Chinese, Stir-fry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 oz Boneless pork loin, cut
           Into shreds ~*
      1 ts Minced ginger
      1 T  Minced green onion
      2 ts Soy sauce
  1 1/2 T  Water
      1 ts Cornstarch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      5 ts Peanut Oil, divided
      2 c  Cabbage, shredded
      1    Leek, cut into 1 1/2" pieces
           (or use green onion)
      1 c  Bamboo shoots, shredded
           (blanched, if fresh)
      3    Dried black mushrooms
      3    Oyster mushrooms
    1/2 c  Dried straw mushrooms
           Hoisin Sauce

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      3 T  Soy Sauce
      1 ts Sesame Oil
      1 T  Rice Wine
      2 T  Oyster Sauce
 
  ~* You can substitute chicken for the pork, if you wish.
  
  This recipe is my own version, after using two different recipes that I
  received and taking what I considered to be the best out of both of them.
  
  Mix first six ingredients in a bowl and marinate (I left mine in the fridge
  for about 3 hours).  Soak dried mushrooms in water until softened. Drain
  and chop, removing and discarding the stems. Chop oyster mushrooms.
  
  Heat wok to very hot (smoking).  Add 2 tsp. oil and stir-fry the cabbage
  and bamboo shoots for one minute.  Remove from wok and set aside. Heat 1
  Tbl. oil in wok, add mushrooms and pork.  Stir-fry until pork is well done.
  Combine bottom four ingredients and stir into the cooked pork. Return
  vegetables to wok and heat through.
  
  To serve, steam Mandarin Pancakes till soft and pliable (3-4 minutes).
  Spread with a little Hoisin Sauce.  Top with Mu Shu Pork, and wrap in
  pancake, sort of like a burrito.  NOTE:  If Mandarin pancakes are not
  available, you can use Spring Roll Wrappers (they are the same thing). If
  they are really thin, use two wrappers or pancakes for each "burrito".

      Title: Stir Fried Pork Mixture for Chow or Lo Mein
 Categories: Chinese, Noodles, Stir-fry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Dried black mushrooms
    1/2 lb Lean pork
      3    Celery stalks
      1    Onion
      2    Scallion stalks
      2 T  Oil
    1/2 t  Salt
      2 T  Soy sauce
      1 t  Sugar
    1/2 c  Stock
 
   1. soak dried mushrooms 2. Slice pork thin or cut in strips. Slice celery,
  onion and soaked mushrooms.
    Cut scallion stalks in 1 inch pieces. 3. Heat oil.
   Add salt, then scallions, and stir-fry until translucent.
    Add pork; stir-fry until it loses its pinkness (2 to 3 minutes). Then
  sprinkle with soy sauce and sugar and blend in. 4. Add celery, onion, and
  mushrooms; stir-fry 2 minutes more. 5. Add stock and heat quickly. Cook,
  uncovered, another 2 to 3 minutes over medium heat. then combine with
  Soft-fried or tossed noodles, as indicated below.
  
   VARIATIONS: Shred the pork and vegetables.  Omit the stock and additional
  cooking in step 5.
  
   Chinese noodles are distinguised not only by their constituents but by the
  way they're prepared. The noodles can be cooked, mixed, blended, and
  combined with just about every variety of meat, seafood, and vegetable.
  They can be added to soup, either alone, or with various toppings..etc etc
  
   LO MEIN means "tossed or mixed noodles" and calls for parboiled noodles
  (also previously drained dry and chilled) to be added, not to the hot oil
  and soft- fried as in CHOW MEIN, but directly to the meat and vegetable
  combinations, which have already been stir-fried. These noodles, tossed or
  mixed and heated through with the cooked combinations, are moister, having
  more of a sauce than the CHOW MEIN.

      Title: Stir-Fried Beef with Orange
 Categories: Stir-fry, Wok, Oriental
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 lb Boneless lean beef
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
      2 ts Rice wine or dry sherry
      1 ts Finely chopped ginger root
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Sesame oil
    1/3 c  Oil, preferably peanut
      2    Dried red chilies, cut in
           Half lengthwise
      1 T  Coarsely chopped fresh
           Orange peel, or 2 t soaked
           And coarsely chopped dried
           Citrus peel
    1/2 ts Finely ground roasted
           Sichuan peppercorns (opt.)
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
 
  Orange flavor beef is a northern Chinese specialty. My version is a little
  different, substituting fresh orange peel for the traditional dried
  tangerine peel.
  
  CUT THE BEEF INTO THIN SLICES 2 inches long, cutting against the grain. Put
  the beef into a bowl together with the soy sauce, rice wine or sherry,
  ginger, cornstarch and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil. Mix well, and then let the
  mixture marinate for about 20 minutes. Heat the oil in a wok or large
  skillet until it is very hot. Remove the beef from the marinade with a
  slotted spoon. Add it to the pan and stir- fry it for 2 minutes until it
  browns. Remove it and leave to drain in a colander or sieve. Pour off most
  of the oil, leaving about 1 teaspoon. Reheat the pan over a high heat and
  then add the dried chilies. Stir-fry them for 10 seconds, and then return
  the beef to the pan. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir-fry for 4
  minutes, mixing well.
  
  Serve the dish at once.

      Title: Stir-Fried Chicken with Dried Red Pepper
 Categories: Ethnic, Poultry, Stir-fry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    2/3 lb Chicken

--------------------------NO. 1, NEXT THREE ITEMS--------------------------
    1/2 tb Shao Hsing wine or dr sherry
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Oil
      3    Dried hot red peppers, diced
      1    Green onion
           -cut into 10 pieces

---------------------------NO. 2, NEXT SIX ITEMS---------------------------
    1/2 tb Shao Hsing
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Water
      2 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Cornstarch
  1 1/2 ts White vinegar
    1/3 c  Fried cashews*
 
  1. Use the blunt edge of a cleaver to lightly tenderize the chicken meat;
  cut the meat into 1-inch cubes. Add ingredients "#1"; mix thoroughly.
  Before frying, add 1 T. oil and mix so that the cubed meat will separate
  easily during frying.
  
  2. Heat the wok then add oil. Stir-fry the chicken meat until cooked;
  remove (precooking). Remove the oil from the wok. Reheat the wok then add 1
  T. oil. Use low heat to stirfry the diced hot red peppers until fragrant.
  Increase heat, add red bell pepper and stirfry briefly. Add chicken,
  onions, and ingredients "#2"; Turn heat to high and quickly stir-fry. Add
  cashews; mix.
  
  *. To prepare Fried Cashews, put a small amount of oil in hot wok and when
  oil is hot add cashews and quickly toast. If desired a bit of dry seasoning
  (salt szechuan peppercorns, etc) can be added prior to nuts.
  
  Roasted cashews may be used. I have also done this recipe with peanuts
  which becomes closer to a Kung Pao style.

  and par-boil or steam them, slice the MUSHROOMs and cut the ONION and green
  PEPPER.  Have all other ingredients on the counter - ready to cook. The
  RICE should be ready to serve when stir frying is done.
  
  Put 1 T. OIL in hot wok or large skillet.  Add GARLIC to oil and stir until
  golden, being careful NOT to brown. Add chicken with marinade and quickly
  stir-fry until no longer pink.  Remove chicken from wok with slotted spoon.
  Set aside and keep warm.
  
  Add 1 T. oil to hot wok.  Add ONION rings and stir until they just begin to
  get golden.  Add BROCCOLI, green PEPPER and stir fry about 2-3 minutes,
  until tender-crisp.  Add CARROTs and MUSHROOMs and cook about 1-2 more
  minutes.  Do not let mixture get over-done.
  
  Add 1 T. CORNSTARCH and 1 T. SUGAR to reserved PINEAPPLE juice and mix

  tender-crisp, return the chicken to the wok. Pour the PINEAPPLE chunks over
  all.  Stir in reserved pineapple juice mixture to make the sweet and sour
  sauce.  Serve over cooked RICE.

  or combine and increase other ingredients to adjust. It makes a pretty

  Heat wok and add oil. Chow beef for about 10 minutes; remove & drain.
  Remove oil and clean wok. Reheat wok and add 1 1/2 T oil, swirl to coat and
