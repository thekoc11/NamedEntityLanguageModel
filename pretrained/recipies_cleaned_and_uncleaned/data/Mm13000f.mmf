      8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate                8    Egg yolks
      2 c  Heavy cream                       1/4 c  Sugar

-------------------------------MOCHA MERINGUE-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar                    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Cornstarch                          2 ts Instant espresso
      1 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder          1/4 ts Cream of tartar
      8    Egg whites                        1/8 ts Salt

----------------------------BITTERSWEET GANACHE----------------------------
      2 c  Heavy cream                         8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
      2 tb Unsalted butter                     4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      2 tb Sugar                          
 
  Combine the raisins and whiskey in a plastic container with a tight fitting
  lid. Allow to stand at room temperature for 6 hours or overnight. Heat 1
  inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place
  8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 2 ounces
  unsweetened chocolate in the top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover
  the top with ilm wrap. Heat for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and
  stir until smooth. Transfer to a stainless steel bowl and set aside until
  needed. Heat the remaining 1 1/2 c heavy cream and the half-and-half in a 2
  1/2-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring the cream to a boil. While
  the cream is heating, place 8 egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar in the bowl of an
  electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the eggs on high for 2 to 2 1/2
  minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Continue to beat on high until
  slightly thickened and lemon-colored, about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. (At this
  point, the cream should be boiling. If not, adjust the mixer speed to low
  and continue to mix until the cream boils. If this is not done, the egg
  yolks will develop undesirable lumps.) Pour the boiling cream into the
  beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine. Return to the saucepan and heat over
  medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the cream reaches a
  temperature of 185~, 2-4 minutes. Then pour into the melted chocolate
  mixture, and stir to combine. Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath to a
  temperature of 40-45~, about 15-20 minutes. Line 2, 8" cake pans with
  enough film wrap to cover the insides of the pan. Set aside until needed.
  Fold the whiskey-soaked raisins and any residual liquid into the cooled
  chocolate custard mixture. Freeze in an ice cream freezer following the
  manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the semi-frozen ice cream to the 2
  cake pans, evenly dividing the ice cream between the two pans. Use a rubber
  spatula to spread the ice cream evenly to the edges of the pans. Tightly
  cover the tops of the pans with film wrap, then place in the freezer for at
  least 12 hours before assembling the cake. See part 2 for rest of
  directions.

      Title: Chocolate Devastation (Part 2)
 Categories: Ice cream, Chocolate
      Yield: 12 servings
 
           - directions continued         
 
  MOCHA MERINGUE: Using a 9" cake circle (or cake plate) as a guide, trace a
  circle on each of 3 sheets of parchment paper (cut to fit the baking
  sheets) with a pencil. Turn each sheet of parchment paper over and place
  with the trace mark down on a baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 250~.
  Combine together in a sifter the confectioners' sugar, cornstarch, and
  cocoa. Sift onto the wax paper and set aside until needed. Heat 1" of water
  in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium-high heat. Place 8 egg
  whites, 3/4 cup sugar, the espresso powder, the cream of tartar, and the
  salt in the top half of the double boiler. Heat the egg white mixture to a
  temperature of 120~ while gently and constantly whisking, about 2-3
  minutes. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with
  a balloon whip. Whisk on high until stiff but not dry, about 2 to 2 1/2
  minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to fold in
  the sifted dry ingredients. Fill a pastry bag (with no tip) with about a
  third of the meringue. Fill a traced circle with meringue: start in the
  center and pipe a 1/2" wide spiral toward the ouside of the circle. Fill
  the pastry bag again and repeat this procedure with each of the 2 remaining
  circles (each circle should be filled with about a third of the original
  amount of meringue.) Place the meringues in the preheated oven and bake for
  1 hour. Reduce the oven temperature to 225~ and bake for an additional 2
  hours. Cool on baking sheets for 30 minutes before handling.
    THE GANACHE: Heat 2 cups heavy cream, the butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar
  in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir to dissolve
  the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil. Place 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate and
  4 ounces unsweetened chocolate in a stainless bowl. Pour the boiling cream
  over the chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth.
  Reserve 1 cup of ganache and set aside at room temperature. Pour the
  remaining amount of ganache onto a baking sheet with sides and refrigerate
  for 35-40 minutes. Pour 1/4 cup of the reserved room-temperature ganache
  onto the center of a baked meringue (supported by a cake circle). Remove an
  ice-cream disk from the freezer. Unwrap the disk and place it onto the
  puddle of ganache. Press down on the ice cream disk gently but firmly (this
  will spread the ganache). Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium-sized star
  tip with one-third of the chilled ganache. Pipe about 28-30 individual
  vertical strips 1 1/2" long and 3/4" wide--all the way around the side of
  the ice cream disk (each strip should be touching the other, and each strip
  should also be wider at the base where it touches the meringue and tapered
  at the crest where it rises to the top edge of the ice cream disk). Place
  this section into the freezer and repeat the preceding procedure with
  another meringue and ice cream disk. Place in the freezer after completion
  for about 10-15 minutes. Remove a meringue and ice cream section from the
  freezer. Pour 1/4 cup of room-temperature ganache onto the center of the
  ice cream. Remove the second section from the freezer, and center onto the
  first. Press down on the ice cream, gently but firmly, to spread the
  ganache. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup of room-temperature genache onto the
  top ice cream disk, and onto this ganache place the remaining baked
  meringue, once again pressing down gently but firmly to spread the ganache.
  Place the Devastation in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes. Fill a pastry
  bag fitted with a medium-sized star tip with the remaining chilled ganache.
  Remove the Devastation from the freezer. Starting 1/2" inside the edge of
  the top meringue, pipe a ring of about 28-30 individual strips--1 1/2" long
  and 3/4" wide--all the way around the top (each strip should be touching
  the other, and each strip should also be wider at the point closest to the
  edge and tapered at the point closest to the center). Return the completed
  Devastation to the freezer for at least 1 hour before serving. To serve,
  cut the Devastation with a serrated slicer. Heat the blade of the slicer
  under hot running water before making each slice. Allow the slices to come

  1. Place the rinsed beans in a bowl, add 2 to 3 cups of water and soak
  overnight. Check the beans occasionally and add water as necessary to keep
  them moist.~ 2. Pour the beans and the water in which they were soaked into
  a heavy saucepan and add 2 to 3 more cups of water. Bring to a boil over
  medium-high heat, then lower heat and simmer, partially covered, for about
  45 minutes, until the beans are cooked but still firm. Check occasionally
  and add water if necessary. Drain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid.~
  3. Melt the lard in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the beans and
  lightly fry them in the lard. Set aside.~ 4. Melt the drippings in a large
  heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it is
  translucent.~ 5. Combine the sausage and the beef with all the spices up
  through the oregano. Add this meat-and-spice mixture to the pot with the
  onion. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring occasionally,
  until the meat is very well browned.~ 6. Add the reserved bean-cooking
  liquid to the pot. Stir in all the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil,
  then lower the heat and cook, uncovered, for 1/2 hour longer. Stir
  occasionally. Add water only if necessary to maintain the consistency of a
  chunky soup.~ 7. Taste when curiosity becomes unbearable and courage is
  strong. Adjust seasonings.~

      2 x  Lour                           
 
  Allow 3 enchiladas per person. Use a Pyrex utility pan (13-1/2" x 8-3/4")
  to cook them. Lightly grease the utility pan (for authenticity use lard).
  Preheat the oven to 400. Chop onions and grate cheese. Saute the onions
  lightly in 2 T. oil. Melt lard in a skillet; stir in the flour and make a
  light roux. Add ground chiles or chile powder, water and salt, and cook
  until thick. Of commercial chile powders, Gebhardt's from San Antonio is
  best, but not as good as ground *chiles pasillas*. Heat the remaining oil
  in a skillet. Using kitchen tongs, dip each tortilla in hot oil until well
  softened (about 15 seconds). Hold tortilla up and allow oil to drip back
  into the skillet. Using the tongs, dip tortillas in chili gravy. Place the
  tortilla in the Pyrex pan, put a good-sized pinch of cheese and onions in
  the middle, and roll the tortilla, placing the flap side down. Continue
  filling and rolling tortillas until the pan is full. Pour more chili gravy
  on top of the enchiladas, sprinkle the top generously with more grated
  cheese, and pop into preheated oven. Cook only until the cheese begins to
  bubble (about 10 minutes). Serve immediately.

  salt & pepper.  Mix together well.Then stir in lentils & let cool.  Mix in
  parsley.
  
  Divide the mixture into 12 equal portions & shape into rounds.  Coat them
  in combined breadcrumbs & oats (oats may have to be blended to resemble
  fine breadcrumbs).  Shallow fry in hot oil until golden brown on both
  sides.  Drain well.
  
  For the yogurt sauce, combine all the ingredients & chill till ready to
  serve.
  
  I find that I do not need to roll the rissoles in egg, though the recipe
  calls for it.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8    Lasagna strips                      6 oz Mushrooms
  1 3/4 lb Spinach                             1 oz Margarine
      1 ts Margarine                         1/4 pt Vegetable stock
      1 ts Marjoram                            1 ts Soy sauce
     12 oz Ricotta cheese                      3 oz Cheddar, grated
           Salt & pepper                  
 
  Preheat oven to 400F.  Cook lasagna in plenty of boiling water for 8 to 10
  minutes.  Drain & rinse in cold water.
  
  Prepare the spinach by washing it in several changes of cold water.  Place
  in a heavy bottomed pot & cook gently without adding more water, for 6 to 8
  minutes.  When cooked, strain off excess water & chop finely.  Return to
  the pot & season well.  Put pan on a gentle heat, add margarine & marjoram,
  stir & then remove from heat.  When the spinach has cooled, mix in the
  ricotta.  Check the seasoning.
  
  Now prepare the sauce.  Saute the sliced mushrooms in margarine, reduce
  heat & continue to cook for 10 minutes in a covered pot so that plenty of
  juice is extracted.  Add the stock & simmer for another 5 minutes.  Puree
  in a blender for a few seconds.  Add soy sauce & season to taste.
  
  Lightly oil a square 3 pint dish, spoon in some of the spinach, cover with
  2 or 3 pieces of lasagna & then a coat of the mushroom sauce.  Repeat,
  ending with the mushroom sauce.  Sprinkle with the grated cheese.  Bake for
  35 to 40 minutes.  Serve immediately.

      Title: Lovage, Potato & Buttermilk Soup
 Categories: Soups/stews
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 1/2 oz Finely chopped onion            1 1/4 pt Chicken or vegetable stock
     10 oz Corsely grated raw potato         1/2 pt Buttermilk, more if desired
           Fresh young lovage leaves      
 
  Put the onion into a heavy-based saucepan.  Add the stock and bring to
  boiling point very slowly so the onion begins to soften a little.
  
  Meanwhile coarsely chop a small handful (5 or so tablespoons) of lovage.
  Add the potato and herbs to the pan and pour on 1/2 pint buttermilk.
  Increase the heat very slightly and bring the mixture to a bare simmer.
  Stir vigorously all the while as the potato starch will thicken the soup,
  which may stick to the pan base.  Half-cover the pan and reduce heat as low
  as possible once again.  Cook very gently indeed, stirring occasionally,
  until the potatoes are perfectly tender.
  
  Whizz the contents of the pan to a smooth puree.  Season with salt and
  pepper and with extra lovage if you like.  Whizz again and thin to taste
  with a little more stock or buttermilk.  Reheat gently or chill thoroughly
  before serving, then garnish with a swirl of buttermilk and a small
  flotilla of chopped fresh lovage.

      Title: Pasta with Pork & Basil
 Categories: Meats, Italian, Pasta, Pork/ham
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Fusilli or other fresh pasta             Fresh basil, parsley, chives
      6 oz Mushrooms                     

-----------------------------FOR THE MEATBALLS-----------------------------
      1 lb Lean freshly minced pork                 Garlic
           Parmesan cheese                   1/2 sm Egg; lightly beaten
           Fresh basil                              A little butter or oil

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
    1/2 oz Butter                            1/2 pt (scant) stock
  1 1/2 tb Plain flour                              Parmesan cheese
    1/4 pt Double cream                             Dijon mustard
 
  Mix all the meatball ingredients thoroughly; I season the meat with 1
  tablespoon grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons basil and 1 smallish garlic
  clove, as well as salt and pepper.  Flour your hands and shape the mixture
  into about 32 small balls.  Fry in batches in a non-stick pan for 5 minutes
  or more until golden and cooked right through.  Shake the pan frequently so
  the meatballs keep in good shape and cook evenly.  Transfer to a casserole
  and keep hot.
  
      Slice the mushrooms thickly, saute' them well and add them to the
  meatballs.  Then "wash out" the frying pan with the chicken stock.  Make a
  smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock and cream.  Add any juices
  that have collected in the casserole and simmer for several minutes. Away
  from the heat, season with salt and pepper, 2 tablespoons Parmesan and 1
  heaped teaspoon Dijon mustard.  Pour the sauce over the meatballs, cover
  and keep hot in a low oven.  The mixture can be kept hot for some time
  without spoiling, or it can be prepared ahead and reheated close to
  serving.
  
      Boil the pasta until al dente and drain well.  Add it to the casserole
  together with a small handful of fresh herbs -- about 2 tablespoons each
  basil and chives, and 1 of parsley -- and toss gently to mix well. Garnish
  with more basil, and serve with an undressed salad.

      Title: Chicken Breasts with Green Coriander (Cilantro)
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    Boneless chicken breasts            2 tb Best quality olive oil
      1 bn Baby carrots                        1 ts Lemon juice
      1 bn Coriander (cilantro)           
 
  Skin the chicken breasts and dust them with a little salt and pepper.  Lay
  each one on a square of baking parchment, flatten it lightly with the palm
  of your hand and lay a sprig of coriander on top.  Fold the sides of the
  paper over the meat, excluding as much air as possible, and roll up to make
  a neat flat parcel.  Then overwrap carefully with foil to make a waterproof
  package.  Trim and scrub the carrots.  Measure the olive oil into a small
  saucepan and add a seasoning of salt and pepper.  Coarsely chop a
  tablespoon or two of coriander leaves (a little less for beginners, a
  little more for addicts) and reserve separately.  All these preparations
  can be done well ahead.
  
      About 20 minutes before you plan to serve the dish, start cooking.
  Steam the baby carrots.  Drop the chicken parcels, seam side up, into a
  large pan of boiling water and cook for 13 to 18 minutes depending on the
  size of the breasts.  Barely a bubble should disturb the surface of the
  liquid while the chicken cooks.  Transfer the parcels, still wrapped up, to
  a low oven for 5 minutes to let the meat set.
  
      Blot the carrots dry and arrange them on a warmed serving dish.  Warm
  the olive oil.  Unwrap the chicken and add just 1 to 2 tablespoons of the
  juices to the pan of warming olive oil.  Quickly carve the breasts into
  thin slices and arrange the meat beside the carrots.  Add the lemon juice
  to the hot olive oil and immediately pour the sizzling mixture over the
  chicken and carrots.  Scatter with chopped coriander and serve straightway
  with hot crusty bread to mop up the juices.

      Title: New Potatoes with Salami & Sorrel
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Small new potatoes                       Coriander seed
      1 sm Handful of sorrel                        Wholegrain mustard
      2 oz Italian salami (or more)                 Olive oil
           -- thinly sliced                         White wine vinegar
      1 sm Onion                          
 
  Chop the onion roughly and partially soften it in 2 generous tablespoons of
  the oil.  Do not let it brown.  Scrub the potatoes (but on no account peel
  them) and steam them.  Wash and dry the sorrel, discarding tough stalks.
  Roll up the leaves tighly in your fingers, just a few at a time, as though
  making a cigarette, and snip across into fine ribbons.
  
      Tip the softened onion and its juices into a big bowl.  Stir in 1/2
  teaspoon each vinegar and mustard, some salt and lots of pepper and
  coriander seed.  The coriander seed should be freshly toasted and ground
  coarsely using a pestle and mortar or a spare peppermil.  Add the potatoes
  to the bowl while still piping hot, so they drink up the flavours of the
  dressing.  Cut each potato in half or into quarters depending on size, and
  toss gently.  Scatter some of the sorrel over the base of a shallow serving
  dish.  Pile the potatoes into the centre, encircle them with the sliced
  salami and scatter the remaining ribbons of sorrel over the top. Serve
  while potatoes are still warm.

      Title: Salmon Steaks in Herb Blankets
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Salmon steaks, 3/4" thick                Fresh parsley, chives, mint,
      4 oz Butter                                   Lemon thyme and tarragon
      1    Lemon                                    -- (or herbs of your choice)
 
  Choose a gratin or baking dish which will take the steaks side by side and
  use some of the butter to grease it thickly.  Put the fish into it and
  season with a squeeze of lemon, a generous grinding of black pepper and a
  little salt.  Cover and set aside in a cool place until ready to cook.
  
      To cook, simply dot the fish with the remaining butter, cover with foil
  and bake at 375-400 F (190-200 C) gas mark 5-6 for 20 to 25 minutes until
  the fish is hot and tender.  While it cooks, chop coarsely and mix together
  heady handfuls of aromatic herbs.  I would probably use something like 8
  tablespoons parsley, 6 of chives, 4 of mint and no more than 2 teaspoons
  each of lemon thyme and tarragon.  You may prefer to use a little dill or
  fennel in place of tarragon, or to concoct some quite different cocktail of
  your own.
  
      Scatter nearly half the herbs on a warm serving dish and lay the fish
  steaks on a bed of herbs.  Scatter more herbs over the fish, spoon on the
  buttery cooking juices then the remaining herbs.  Serve with wedges of
  lemon and steamed new potatoes.  (Other vegetables are best served as a
  separate course.)

 Categories: Vegetarian, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Shortcrust pastry                   4    Eggs
           -- (see note)                       2 tb Milk (or more)
      6 oz Curd cheese                              Fresh mint, parsley & chives
      4 oz Cottage cheese                           Beaten egg to glaze
      2 oz (generous) mature cheddar      
 
  *Note: Shortcrust pastry should be made with 8 oz flour, preferably whole
  wheat.
  
  Sieve both the soft cheeses to make a smooth mixture.  Beat in about 2
  tablespoons each coarsley chopped parsley, mint and chives to make a
  prettily green-flecked mixture.  Add salt, pepper and the milk.
  
     Use half the pastry to line a pie plate measuring about 8 1/2 inches
  across the top.  Put the cheese mixture into it, make four hollows with the
  back of a spoon and break an egg into each.  Season the eggs with a pinch
  of salt, a good grinding of pepper and scatter more herbs over the top--at
  least 3 tablespoons of mint and perhaps 1 of chives.
  
      Cover with remaining pastry.  Seal, flute, glaze and make a few steam
  slits in the usual way.  Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 425 F (220 C)
  gas mark 7 for 25 minutes, then at 375 F (190 C) gas mark 6 for 15 minutes.
  Cool for 5-10 minutes before serving with a tomato salad or a green salad.

      Title: Beekeeper's Cabbage
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Red cabbage (1-1/2 to 2 lbs)      1/2 oz Butter
      1    Onion                               2 tb Fruit vinegar (or more)
      1    Parsnip                                  -- preferably raspberry
      1 lg Apple                                    Caraway seeds
      1 tb Honey                             1/4 pt Yoghurt or sour cream, opt.
 
  Cut cabbage into quarters.  Remove and discard the tough central stalk.
  Shred the cabbage and put it into a large mixing bowl.  Peel and finely
  chop the onion and add it to the cabbage.  Cut the parsnip and apple into
  small pieces, peeling them first if you wish, and add them to the bowl.
  Drizzle on the honey.  Add a good seasoning of salt and pepper and scant
  1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds.  Sprinkle on the vinegar , use 3 tablespoons if
  the apple you are using is the dessert variety, just 2 tablespoons if it is
  a cooking apple.  Mix everything together well using your hands -- a little
  messy, but spoons are not as effective -- then pile the mixture into a
  buttered casserole.  Lay a sheet of thickly buttered greaseproof paper
  directly on top of the vegetables and cover the casserole with a well
  fitting lid to prevent drying out.
  
      Cook at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for about 2-1/2 hours until the
  vegetables are beautifully tender, if possible stir the mixture once or
  twice as it cooks.  Remove the greaseproof paper and check seasoning
  immediately before serving.  Serve the vegetable mixture just as it is, or
  top at the last minute with 1/4 pint cold creamy yoghurt or soured cream
  into which you have stirred a few bruised and lightly crushed caraway
  seeds.  Or hand round the bowl of flavoured cream separately, so that those
  who want it can help themselves.

 Categories: Meats, Lamb
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Leg of lamb (about 4 lbs)                Olive oil
      3 lb Potatoes (about 5 oz each)               Butter
           Lemon (may be doubled)                   Rosemary, thyme & oregano
           Honey                          
 
  Put the leg of lamb into a large roasting pan.  Bruise the leaves of 2 or 3
  sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle them over the meat.  Add plenty of pepper
  and 1 tablespoon honey.  Rub the mixture into the meat with your hands.
  Then rub half a lemon over the joint, squeezing the juice on to the meat as
  you do so.  Do not add any salt.  Leave to marinate for 4 to 24 hours.
  
      Peel and quarter the potatoes, then arrange them in a single layer
  round the lamb.  Squeeze lemon juice over the potatoes -- use at least half
  a lemon, or up to one and a half lemons for a strong citrus flavour.
  Carefully pour 1/4 pint water into a corner of the roasting pan, then
  sprinkle over the potatoes and lamb about 2 tablespoons chopped fresh
  rosemary, at least 1 teaspoon each fresh chopped thyme and oregano, and
  some salt and pepper.  Drizzle on 1-1/2 teaspoons honey and 1 tablespoon
  olive oil, then dot with 1 oz butter.  Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 6 for
  a further 1 to 1-1/4 hours.  The ingredients will become gilded and will
  burnish to a rich brown in places.  Lift the meat and turn the potatoes
  occasionally, and if necessary, add a little boiling water to the pan to
  prevent drying out.

      Title: Elizabethan Orange Tart
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    10" shortcrust pastry case               Allspice
           -- thoroughly blind-bakec         1/4 pt Double cream
      2    Thin-skinned oranges              1/4 lb Fromage blanc (or see note)
           Honey and sugar                          -OR- Low-fat soft cheese
           Stick cinnamon                      2 tb Ground almonds
           Ground cinnamon                
 
  Measure 2 tablespoons sugar into a bowl and stir in 4 tablespoons boiling
  water. Add a cinnamon stick and 1/4 pint cold water. Scrub the oranges,
  flute the peel lightly with a citrus zester and slice the fruit thinly,
  discarding the ends. Remove pips (seeds), put the orange slices into the
  sweetened water and leave to soak overnight. Next day, turn the oranges and
  their liquid into a saucepan. Cover and cook very gently for about 30
  minutes. Carefully turn the slices once they cook. Lift the cooked orange
  slices from the pan one at a time, shaking to let the syrup drip back into
  the pan, and put them on a rack to drain and become cold. Remove the
  cinnamon stick, then boil the syrup until reduced to a few sticky
  spoonfuls. Cool slightly then stir in the 1 tablespoon honey. Assemble the
  tart just before serving. First sprinkle the ground almonds over the base
  of the cold pastry shell. Sweeten and flavour the soft cheese by stirring
  into it 1 teaspoon or so of honey and a little each of ground cinnamon and
  allspice. Whip the cream, fold in the sweetened and flavoured cheese, then
  spoon this mixture into the pastry shell. Arrange the orange slices on top,
  overlapping them slightly in decorative circles, and glaze with the gently
  re-warmed syrup.

      Title: Golden Wardens
 Categories: Fruits, Desserts
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Pears                                    Honey
      1    Lemon                               8 fl White grape juice
 
  Warden is the old name for the small hard cooking pear that used to grow in
  many country gardens.  The best way to cook them was slowly with honey and
  fruit juice to warm and round out their thin colour and flavour, but this
  recipe works well for dessert pears too.
  
  Choose a casserole or baking dish with just enough room to lay pears head
  to tail in  single layer.  Peel the pears thinly, leaving the stalks on,
  then immediately roll each one in a saucer containing the juice of the
  lemon.  Put the pears into the dish.  Spoon on scant 4 tablespoons honey
  and add any lemon juice remaining in the saucer.  Bring the grape juice to
  simmering point and pour it over the pears.  Cover the dish and bake at
  325-350 F (160-180 C) gas mark 3-4 until the fruit is beautifully tender.
  How long this will take varies enormously - 1 hour is enough for semi-ripe
  dessert pears; 3 hours or more may be needed for pears so hard that they
  seem to be carved from wood.  Baste the pears frequently as they bake and
  turn them occasionally to encourage even cooking.
  
      When the pears are ready, transfer them to a serving dish, standing
  them upright.  Boil the cooking liquid until it turns syrupy and is reduced
  by about half.  Stir in an extra tablespoon or two of honey if you think a
  little more sweetness is desirable but avoid the temptation to make the
  juices too sweet; the appeal of the dish lies in its fruitiness. Spoon the
  syrupy glaze over the pears.  Serve warm or cold.

      Title: Carrots with Ginger and Orange
 Categories: Salads, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb (scant) maincrop carrots            1 sm Bunch of mint
      3 sm Oranges                             1 ts Honey
           Fresh ginger root                   1 ts Lemon juice
      1 sm Garlic clove                             Olive oil
      1 oz Walnut kernals                 
 
  First make the dressing.  Finely grate the zest of 1 orange into a bowl.
  Add its juice, the honey and lemon juice and 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Peel
  1/2 inch or so of ginger and chop it as finely as possible; then crush the
  small garlic clove.  Add both these ingredients to the bowl with a little
  salt and pepper.  Mix well then push 2 sprigs of mint into the liquid.
  
  Scrub and scrape the carrots, or peel them if you insist, then grate them
  coarsely and add to the dressing.  Peel the remaining 2 oranges and cut
  into segments; be ruthless about cutting away all traces of pith and the
  membrane that divides one segment from the next.  Remove pips (seeds) with
  the tip of a knife and add the oranges to the salad bowl.  Mix all the
  ingredients together gently, then cover the salad and set it aside for 2
  hours or a little longer to allow flavours to blend and develop.
  
  Close to serving time, remove and discard the tired sprigs of mint, stir in
  the walnuts and scatter with fresh torn mint leaves.

      Title: Rhubarb Sorbet
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Rhubarb (trimmed weight)            1    Orange (zest only)
      4 tb Honey                               2    Egg whites
 
  Prepare and cook the rhubarb at least a day ahead of serving the sorbet.
  Wipe and trim the fruit, then slice it quite thinly into a flameproof
  casserole.  Sprinke the finely grated orange zest over it and drizzle on 2
  tablespoons of the honey.  Cover and leave in a cool place for 2 hours or
  more until the sweetener has drawn out some of the rhubarb juices; this
  liquid will prevent sticking during cooking.
  
      Cook the rhubarb in the covered dish until perfectly tender - I think
  this is best done in a low oven but you can use a very gentle flame on top
  of the stove if you prefer.  Let the cooked rhubarb cool slightly, then add
  the remaining 2 tablespoons honey and whizz to a very smooth puree in a
  food-processor.
  
      When the puree is quite cold, freeze it in a chilled loaf tin, or other
  suitable container, until firm round the edges.  Beat the half-frozen
  sorbet until slushly.  Whisk the egg whites and fold them in so the mixture
  looks like a pale pink snow.  Cover and freeze until solid. Beat to break
  up ice crystals and to increase bulk, then freeze the sorbet again until
  you are ready to serve it.  Shortbread fingers make a good crunchy
  accompaniment.

      Title: Greenhouse Kebabs
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Aubergine (eggplant)                6 sm Onions
      1 lg Red or yellow pepper               12 sm Cap mushrooms
      3    Courgettes (baby zucchinis)   

--------------------------------FLAVOURINGS--------------------------------
      4 tb Lemon juice                              Coriander seed,coarse ground
      4 tb Peanut oil                               Coarsely ground black pepper
      2 tb Honey                         

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
  2 1/2 oz Peeled onion                    1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
      2    Garlic cloves                       1 ts Coriander seeds
      5 tb Peanut butter                     3/4 ts Chili powder
      2 tb Peanut oil                          2 ts Anchovy essence
  1 1/2 tb Honey                          
 
  Cut the aubergine and pepper into chunks; cut the onions into wedges; slice
  the courgettes into 1-to 1-1/2-inch lengths; leave the mushrooms whole. Mix
  together all flavouring ingredients.  Toss the vegetables in the
  flavourings and marinate for 2 to 4 hours.
  
     The sauce should be part-prepared well ahead.  Chop the onion and garlic
  roughly, then whizz them in a food-processor or blender with the coriander
  seeds.  Add the chili, oil and anchovy essence and whizz again. Add the
  peanut butter, lemon juice and honey and process once more. Scrape the
  puree into a small saucepan, cover and set aside for at least 1 hour before
  cooking.
  
     Thread the vegetables on to skewers and grill under moderate heat for
  10-15 minutes, basting with the marinade liquid as necessary.  Meanwhile,
  add 5 tablespoons warm water to the pan of sauce and set it over medium
  heat.  Cook at a steady bubble, stirring often, until the sauce is hot and
  aromatic.  Reduce heat to a very low and cook for a few minutes longer,
  adding more water if necessary to achieve a good creamy consistency, and
  adjust seasoning to taste.  Hand round the sauce separately.

      Title: Skewered Fish with Honey-Mustard Sauce
 Categories: Fish/sea, Sauces
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Firm white fish fillets           1/4 lb Mushrooms
           -- (very thick),                    2 sm Onions (or more)
           -- preferably halibut,              8    Cherry tomatoes
           -- turbot or monkfish               1    Lemon
    1/4 lb Streaky bacon                            Oil

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
      2 ts Honey                           1 1/2 tb Tarragon vinegar
      1    Egg yolk                          1/4 pt Sunflower or safflower oil
      1 tb (rounded) French mustard       
 
      Cut the fish into large cubes, put it into a dish and sprinkle with
  lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Cut the onions into wedges, put them into a
  separate bowl with the mushrooms, add a good grinding of pepper, and oil
  and lemon juice - in the ratio of 2 tablespoons oil to 1 tablespoon lemon.
  Leave to absorb flavours for an hour or more.  Halve the bacon rashers,
  de-rind them, stretch and roll them up loosely.
  
      The sauce can also be made in advance.  Beat the honey, mustard and egg
  yolk together in a small bowl.  Add the vinegar, a spoonful at a time,
  whisking it in with a balloon whisk or fork.  Then add the oil, pouring it
  from a jug in a thin stream and whisking the contents of the bowl all the
  time as you pour.  Continue whisking for about a minute until the sauce is
  a homogeneous thick cream, then season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
      Close to serving time, thread the fish, onions and mushrooms on to
  skewers, adding the bacon rolls and tomatoes here and there.  Grill for 10
  minutes or so under medium-high heat, turning and basting occasionally with
  the marinade liquid.  Serve immediately with a dish of rice and hand round
  the sauce separately.

      Title: Lincolnshire Plum Bread
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Strong white bread flour          1/4 lb Butter; melted
    1/4 oz Easy-blend yeast                    8 tb Milk; warm
      1 ts Ground cinnamon                   1/2 lb Prunes; cut into
      1 ts Ground allspice                          - sultana-size pieces
      4 tb Sugar                               2 oz Currants
      1 pn Salt                                2 oz Sultanas
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten           
 
  Using a food-mixer or processor or your hands, mix and knead all the
  ingredients except the dried fruits to a smooth and elastic dough.  Cover
  and leave to rise until doubled in size - about 1 hour in a warm room.
  
      Knock back the risen dough and knead again briefly, gradually working
  in the dried fruits until evenly distributed.  Divide the dough in two,
  shape and put into two small (1 lb) greased and lined loaf tins.  Cover and
  leave to prove (rise) until puffy and light.
  
      Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5 for 40-50
  minutes.  Take the loaves out of the tins and return them to the oven for a
  further 10 minutes or so as necessary - the bread will sound hollow when
  tapped on the base if it is properly cooked.  Makes 2 small loaves.

      Title: Scotch Pancakes
 Categories: Breads, Pancakes, Breakfast
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/4 lb Plain white household flour         1 oz Caster sugar
      1 ts Bicarbonate of soda                 1    Egg
  1 1/2 ts Cream of tartare                  1/4 pt Milk or cream
 
  Sift the flour with the raising agents and stir in the sugar.  Make a well
  in the centre and break the egg into it.  Whisk the milk into the egg, then
  gradually incorporate the dry ingredients to make a very smooth, thick
  batter.  Alternately, simply mix everything together in a food processor.
  If time permits let the batter stand for 30 minutes before cooking.
      Heat a griddle, bakestone or cast-iron frying pan until very hot - or
  cook direct on the hot plate of an Aga.  Grease your chosen surface lightly
  with buttered paper, using just enough fat to prevent the pancakes from
  sticking.  Using a large metal spoon held point downward, drop a few small
  rounds of batter on to the hot surface.  Space them well apart. Cook over
  steady heat until bubbles rise to the surface and the underside of the
  pancakes are browned - about 2 minutes.  Loosen them gently with a palette
  knife, then flip them over and cook for about 1 minute longer.
  
  Makes about 16 pancakes.

      Title: Wiltshire Lardy Cake
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Strong white bread flour          1/2 oz Melted lard
      1 ts Easy-blend yeast                  1/4 pt Warm water (or milk & water)
    1/2 ts Salt                          

---------------------------------TO FINISH---------------------------------
    1/4 lb Pure pork lard; diced                    Allspice
           Lard for greasing the pan                Demerara sugar
           Cinnamon                      

-------------------------MIX TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING-------------------------
      1 oz Sultanas; chopped                   1 oz Currents; chopped
      1 oz Raisins; chopped                    1 oz Chopped candied peel
 
  Using a food-mixer or processor or your hands, mix and knead the dough.
  Cover it with oiled polythene and leave to rise until doubled in size; this
  will take about 1 hour in a warm place.
  
  Knock back the dough, knead it again briefly and roll out to an oblong. Mix
  together 1-1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ground allspice and 2
  ounces sugar and sprinkle half of this mixture over the dough.  Add half
  the dried fruits and half the diced lard.  Roll up the dough, like a swiss
  roll, give it a quarter turn and roll it out to an oblong again. Sprinkle
  with sugar and spices, dried fruits and fat exactly as before. Then roll up
  and roll out the dough to an oblong once again, but this time make it the
  right size to fit a shallow baking or roasting tin about 7-inches square.
  Grease the tin and put the dough into it, pressing it well into the
  corners.  Cover and leave to prove (rise) until the dough is light, puffy
  and well risen.
  
  Score the top of the dough with a diamond pattern, brush with melted lard
  and sprinkle on 1 ounce of sugar.  Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7 until
  cooked to a golden brown and smelling delicious, 35-40 minutes.
  
  Cool the cake briefly in the tin so that the melted fat is re-absorbed,
  then serve it while still warm, cut into large sticky fingers.   Makes 1
  cake

      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 lb Stong white bread flour             1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Easy-blend yeast                    1 oz Butter; melted
    1/2 ts Salt                              1/4 pt Milk; warmed

           Clotted cream                  
 
  Using a food-processor, a food mixer with a dough hook, or your hands, mix
  the dry ingredients, add the warm milk and melted butter and mix and knead
  to a smooth elastic dough.  Cover with lightly oiled polythene and leave to
  rise until doubled in size - about 1 hour in a warm place.
  
      Knock back and knead again briefly.  Divide the dough into eight and
  shape into small round buns.  Space them well apart on a greased baking
  tray.  Cover and set aside to prove (rise) until light and puffy - about 20
  minutes.
  
      Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7 for 15-20 minutes until golden brown.
  Cool, then cut each bun down the middle, from top to bottom but not all the
  way through.  Split open and fill with cream and jam.  Be generous,
  allowing plenty of jam and no less than 1 oz clotted cream per bun.  Then
  dust with icing sugar.  Makes 8 buns.

      Title: Grasmere Gingerbread
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 18 servings
 
      1 lb Fine oatmeal                      1/2 lb Pale muscovado sugar
    1/2 ts Baking powder                     1/2 lb Butter
      4 ts Ground ginger                       2 tb Golden syrup
      1 pn Allspice                       
 
  Line a swiss roll or baking tin measuring about 9 x 13 inches with bakewell
  or greaseproof paper and grease it well.  Stir the dry ingredients
  together.  Melt the butter and syrup over low heat, pour on to the dry
  ingredients and stir well to make a fairly stiff mixture. Spread the
  mixture evenly over the base of the prepared tin and bake at 350 F (180 C)
  gas mark 4 for 25-30 minutes.  Do not be alarmed by the fact that the
  mixture will look a little runny when it emerges from the oven; this is
  normal.  Mark the biscuits into fingers or squares while still warm but
  leave in the tin until completely cold.  Don't make the biscuits very big ~
  they are chewy and very filling.  Good exercise for the jaws and high in
  calories.

      Title: Nier Beurre (Channel Islands Fruit Butter)
 Categories: Fruits, Spreads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Dessert apples                    1/2    Orange
      1 lb Cooking apples                    1/2    Lemon
           Granulated sugar                         Ground cinnamon & allspice
      2 pt Dry cider                      
 
  Fast boil the cider until reduced by half.  Peel, core and slice HALF of
  each sort of apple; add them to the pan, pushing them well down into the
  liquid.  Half-cover the pan and simmer gently until the fruit is soft.
  
      Add the remaining apples, prepared in the same way, together with the
  juice and zest of the citrus fruits.  Half-cover the pan and continue
  simmering until all the fruit is well reduced, pulpy and tender. Stir
  occasionally and crush the fruit down into the pan with a potato masher as
  it cooks.  Measure the pulp and process it to a puree if it is at all
  lumpy.  Add sugar at the rate of 10 oz for every pint of apple pulp, and
  stir in about 1 teaspoon ground allspice.
  
      Simmer, stirring frequently, until most of the moisture has been driven
  off.  The readiness of a fruit butter is judged by its consistency, not by
  set or temperature.  It is ready when it is nearly dry - a spoon drawn
  across the mixture should leave its own impression.  Pot in small, clean,
  warm jars and store in a very cold larder or fridge.  Once jar is opened,
  the contents should be eaten up within 3 or 4 days. Makes enough to fill 4
  or 5 small jars.

    1/4 lb Runny honey                         1 tb Milk (or double this amount)
      1 tb Runny honey                    
 
  Sieve the flour, raising agent and spice into a bowl. Lightly grease a tin
  pie plate measuring about 8-1/2-inches across the top.
  
  Cream the butter with 3 oz sugar until creamy and light. Add the egg yolks
  then the 1/4 lb honey, gradually. Gently mix in the flour, then the milk.
  Spread the mixture in the prepared tin, mounding it slightly in the centre,
  and then bake at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for about half an hour.
  
  Let the cake rest in its tin for 2 minutes before turning it out on to a
  wire rack. Let it cool for 10 minutes then slide it on to a baking tray and
  brush the top with 1 tablespoon warmed honey - or redcurrant jelly if you
  prefer. Whisk the egg whites and the remaining 1 oz sugar to make a glossy
  meringue mixture. Swirl this over the top of the cake and bake at 325 F
  (160 C) gas mark 3 for about 20 minutes. Serve the cake when it is cold.
  Makes 1 cake.

      Title: Apricot, Orange & Almond Jam
 Categories: Fruits, Preserve
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Dried apricots                      2    Lemons
      2 oz Split almonds                   2 1/2 lb Sugar
      3    Oranges                         2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  Chop the apricots roughly.  Put them into a large bowl, sprinkling the fine
  grated zest of the oranges and the cinnamon between layers. Squeeze the
  juice of the oranges, measure and add enough water to make 3 pints in all.
  Pour the liquids over the fruit and leave to soak overnight in a cool
  place.
  
  Slide the contents of the bowl into a preserving pan and simmer gently
  until the fruit is beautifully tender.  Check the fruit occasionally as it
  cooks and crush it down into the pan with a potato masher.  It may need
  1-1/4 hours to become really soft.
  
  Warm the sugar.  Add it to the pan together with the juice of the lemons
  and the almonds.  Cook gently until the sugar is melted, then fast-boil
  until the saucer test shows that the preserve will set.  Pot, tie down and
  label the preserve in the usual way.  Makes enough to fill 5 jars.

      Title: Welsh Cakes
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 15 servings
 
      1 lb Self-raising flour                  4 oz Sultanas and raisins
      2 oz Butter                              2    Eggs
      4 oz Sugar                             1/3 pt Water
 
  On sale in every Welsh bakery, these are one of the great delights of
  teatime.  The are easy to make.  The Welsh use a flat iron "planc" (a
  griddle) to bake the cakes, which are cooked on top heat like Scotch
  pancakes.  A heavy frying pan will do fine if you don't have a griddle.
  Makes 15-18 cakes.
  
  Rub the fat into the flour and add the fruit and sugar.  Mix the water with
  the eggs and use to make a soft dough just a little firmer than that for
  the scones.  Tip on to a well-floured board and roll out to a thickness of
  1/2-inch.  Cut out circles with a 2-1/2-inch shell-edged cutter.
  
  Heat a planc or heavy iron frying pan - get the heat up into it gently and
  thoroughly, and do not let it overheat.  If the pan is not well-seasoned or
  non-stick, slick it with a little butter or vegetable oil.
  
  Bake the cakes on the pan, turning them once, until well-risen and lightly
  browned.  They will take about 5 minutes each side.  Eat hot or cold, with
  or without salty butter, but always with a cup of piping-hot tea.

      Title: Home-Made Ginger Beer
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 oz Fresh ginger                        1 lb Sugar
      2    Lemons                              1 ga Boiling water
      1 ts Cream of tartar                     1 oz Yeast
 
  This home-brew remains a favourite party drink in a Welsh household for
  both adults and children.  You will need eight pint bottles or four quart
  bottles.  They should be of a strong material and have firm caps with metal
  springs to imprison the effervescent liquid - it's more explosive than
  champagne.  Makes 1 gallon.
  
  Roughly crush the ginger root.  Wash and slice the lemons into thick rings.
  Put the ginger, lemon, cream of tartar and sugar in a large bowl. Pour the
  boiling water over.  Stir and leave to cool to blood temperature. Stir in
  the yeast.  Leave to ferment for 24 hours.  Skim off the yeast. Strain and
  bottle the liquid.  Leave for three days before broaching it.

      Title: Bacon Cawl with Three Sauces
 Categories: Soups/stews, Sauces
      Yield: 4 servings
 
----------------------------------THE CAWL----------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Collar bacon with rind              3 pt Water

---------------------------------VEGETABLES---------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Potatoes                            2 lg Leeks (or spring onions)
      1 sm Swede (rutabaga)                    2 tb Chopped parsley
      3    Mature carrots                

----------------------------SAUCES FOR THE MEAT----------------------------

---------------------------MUSTARD AND EGG SAUCE---------------------------
      2 oz Butter                            1/2 pt Cawl stock & milk mixed
      1 oz Flour                               1    Hard-boiled egg
      1 ts Dry mustard powder                  1 tb Vinegar
    1/2 ts Powdered tumeric              

---------------------------SPICED TOMATO KETCHUP---------------------------
      1 lb Ripe tomatoes                       1 oz Sugar
      1 sm Onion                               1 tb Malt vinegar
      1 ts Ground ginger                            Salt and pepper
    1/4 ts Powdered cloves                     1 sm Green chili (optional)

--------------------------PARSLEY-AND-CHIVE SAUCE--------------------------
      1 oz Butter                              2 tb (heaped) chopped parsley
      1 oz Flour                               1 tb (heaped) chopped chives
    1/2 pt Cawl stock and milk mixed                Salt and pepper
 
  Wash the joint to remove surface blood.  Put the meat into a large clean
  pan and cover well with water.  Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down,
  cover with lid and simmer for 2 hours. Top up if the water sinks below the
  level of the meat - at the end of the cooking you should have 2 pints of
  liquor.  Leave it to cool, meat and all, and lift off the white hat of
  grease (it makes good dripping after heating gently to drive off the
  water).  Some families like the fat left in.
  
  Prepare the vegetables - scrub, peel and cut them into bite-sized chunks as
  appropriate.  Wash and slice the leeks into 1/2-inch rings.  Then make the
  sauces.
  
  For the MUSTARD AND EGG SAUCE: Melt 1 oz butter in a small pan.  When it
  froths, sprinkle in the flour and fry for a moment until mixture is sandy.
  Stir in the mustard powder and tumeric and immediately whisk in the broth
  and milk.  Whisk till the mixture thickens.  Chop the egg and stir in.
  Finish with the vinegar and beat in the extra ounce of butter.  Taste and
  add salt and pepper.
  
  For the SPICED TOMATO KETCHUP: Chop the tomatoes, skin and chop the onion.
  Put all the ingredients except the optional chili into a lidded saucepan.
  Bring to the boil, turn down the heat, leave to simmer gently for 30
  minutes.  Push the contents of the pan and boil it fiercely for a few
  minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Serve either hot or cold. Finish
  with a few slices of deseeded chili if you like it hot.
  
  For the PARSLEY-AND-CHIVE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a small pan, stir in
  the flour and let it cool for a moment.  Whisk in the liquid gradually and
  stir over the heat until the mixture thickens.  Mix in the herbs, taste and
  add salt and pepper.  Reheat the meat in its broth (the cawl).  Remove the
  meat and keep it warm while you cook the root vegetables in the broth. Five
  minutes before you are ready to serve, add the leeks.  While the vegetables
  simmer, plain-boil the potatoes separately.  Stir the chopped parsley into
  the soup just before you bring it to table.
  
  As a second course, serve the meat with the potatoes, and the three sauces.

      Title: Gooseberry Burnt Creams
 Categories: Fruits, Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Tart green gooseberries           1/2 lb Fromage blanc or quark
      4 oz Caster sugar (or more)                   -OR- creamy Greek yoghurt
      5 oz Granulated sugar                  1/2 pt Double cream
 
  Choose a heavy-based saucepan with a large surface area.  Put the topped
  and tailed gooseberries into it, still moistened by the water in which they
  have been rinsed.  Cover and cook over very low heat until the fruit is
  perfectly tender.  (It does not matter if the berries collapse in cooking
  here as they will be crushed to a pulp for serving.)
  
  Crush the cooked fruit with a potato masher and cook for several minutes
  more, without the lid but just stirring occasionally, until most of the
  juices have evaporated leaving a thick fruit puree.  Add caster sugar to
  taste and stir until melted.  Spoon the puree into 8 individual cocotte
  dishes and leave until cold.
  
  Beat the fromage blanc, quark or yoghurt into the cream until smoothly
  mixed then whisk until fairly stiff.  Spoon the creamy mixture over the
  cold puree and level the tops.  Cover and chill in the freezer for about 45
  minutes until the cream firms up.
  
  Dissolve the granulated sugar in 1 tablespoon warm water in a pan placed
  over low heat.  Then turn the heat up and cook until the sugar carmelises
  to a rich shade of gold.  Quickly pour the burnt sugar evenly over the
  chilled creams and set aside for 20 minutes or so until the caramel sets in
  thin brittle sheets of gold.

      Title: Wiltshire Whitsun Cake
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    3/4 lb Sm. tart green gooseberries         6 oz Butter
      5    Elderflower blossoms*               6 oz Pale muscovado sugar
    1/2 lb Plain wholemeal flour                    Demerara sugar
      2 ts Baking powder                            Flowers & leaves to garnish
      2 lg Eggs                           
 
  *Note: A handful of sweet geranium or lemon balm leaves may be substitued
  for elderflower blossoms if desired.
  
  Top and tail the gooseberries into a mixing bowl.  Add the finely chopped
  leaves or the florets of elderflower carefully stripped from the stalk, and
  stir to mix with the fruit.  Sift the flour and baking powder into a
  separate bowl.  Cut then rub in the butter.  Stir in the muscovado sugar
  then the lightly beaten eggs. Finally, stir in the gooseberries and their
  flavourings.
  
  Grease the base of an 8-inch spring-clip cake tin, line and grease again.
  Turn the cake mixture into it and mound it up in the middle.  Bake at 350 F
  (180 C) gas mark 4 for about 1 1/2 hours.  Unlike most cakes, this one does
  not come away from the sides of the tin when it is cooked.
  
  Cool for a few minutes before unmoulding.  Sprinkle with demerara sugar and
  decorate with fresh elder blossom or sweet geranium or melissa leaves, and
  serve the deliciously moist cake while it is still warm - as a pudding,
  with plenty of cream.

      Title: Muscat Ice
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Tart green gooseberries             6 oz Caster sugar
      3    Heads elderflower blossoms*       225 g  Greek strained yoghurt
 
  *Note: You may use 3 OR 4 heads of elderflower blossom.
  
  Put the gooseberries into a heavy-based saucepan or casserole.  The fruit
  should be still damp from rinsing under the tap but there is no point in
  spending time topping and tailing it as it is going to be sieved.  Add the
  florets of elder blossom, stripped from their stalks, and bury them among
  the fruit.  Cover tightly and cook in a low oven until the fruit is tender
  and pulpy - I allow 1 hour or so at 275-300 F (140-150 C) gas mark 1 or 2.
  Or cook over a very gentle flame if preferred.
  
  Add the sugar and stir until it no longer feels gritty.  Then rub the fruit
  and every drop of its sugary juices through a sieve to make a perfectly
  smooth seeless puree.  As soon as it is cold, spoon the pale aromatic puree
  into a chilled loaf tin, cover it and freeze.
  
  About an hour later, when the ice is firm around the edges but still soft
  in the centre, beat it or whizz it in a food-processor until mushy. Gently
  fold in the yoghurt, cover and freeze until solid all the way through.
  
  Then turn out the ice-cream, beat it again to break up any ice crystals and
  transfer it to 8 petit pots de chocolat.  Cover and freeze until about 1
  hour before serving, when the ice-cream should be placed in the fridge to
  "ripen" it.  Amaretti biscuits go very well with this.

      Title: Rhubarb Crumble-Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Fruits
      Yield: 10 servings
 
     14 oz Rhubarb, trimmed weight             1    Orange
     10 oz Self-raising flour              1 1/2 oz Chopped hazelnut kernels
      7 oz Butter                            1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      4 oz Caster sugar                        2 lg Eggs
      3 oz Pale muscovado sugar           
 
  First make the nutty crumble topping.  Sift 4 oz flour into a bowl, and add
  3 oz butter.  Do not rub in the fat but cut it in with a pastry blender or
  a pair of knives used like scissors.  Stir in the muscovado sugar and nuts
  and set aside.
  
  Sift the remaining 6 oz flour and the cinnamon into a separate bowl and
  reserve.  Slice the rhubarb into 1-inch chunks and finely grate the zest of
  the orange over it.  Cream the remaining 1/4 lb butter with the caster
  sugar until pale, creamy and light.  Break up the eggs with a fork and add
  them to the butter mixture a little at a time, alternating with spoonfuls
  of the flour and cinnamon and add 2 tablespoons of orange juice.
  
  Spoon the cake mixture evenly over the base of a 9-inch spring-clip tin
  that has been greased, lined and greased again.  Scatter the rhubarb and
  orange mixture evenly over the top then cover the fruit with the nutty
  crumble mixture.  Bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for about 1 1/4 hours.
  
  Leave in a warm draught-free place to cool down slowly after baking and
  wait until the crumble-cake is completely cold before taking it out of the
  tin.  Wait until the next day before eating.

      Title: Rhubarb, Rose, & Strawberry Jam
 Categories: Preserve
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Rhubarb, trimmed weight           1/2 lb Highly scented rose petals
      1 lb Small strawberries              1 1/2 lb Sugar
           -- slightly underripe               4 sm Juicy lemons
 
  Rhubarb is an unreliable setter so the inclusion of lemon juice in this
  recipe is essential and I like to play it safe by cooking the lemon pips
  with the fruit in order to extract their pectin.  Slice the rhubarb and
  layer it in a large bowl with the whole hulled strawberries and the sugar.
  Pour on the lemon juice, cover and leave overnight.
  
  Tip the contents of the bowl into a preserving pan.  Add the lemon pips
  tied in a muslin bag and bring gently to a boil.  Boil for 2 minutes then
  tip the contents of the pan back into the bowl.  Cover and leave in a cool
  place over night once more.
  
  Put the rhubarb and strawberry mixture back into the pan.  Pinch out the
  white tips from the bases of the rose petals and add the petals to the pan,
  pushing them well down among the fruit.  Bring to the boil and fast boil
  until setting point is reached, then pot in warm sterilised jars in the
  usual way. Makes enough to fill 6 or 7 jars.

      Title: Boxwallah's Chutney
 Categories: Relishes
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Rhubarb, trimmed weight             2 ts Curry powder
      1 lb Onions                              6 oz Granulated sugar
    1/2 lb Raisins                           3/4 pt Raspberry vinegar
    1/2 lb Sultanas                                 -OR- red wine vinegar
    1/2 oz Coriander seeds                
 
  Cut the trimmed rhubarb into short lenghths and chop the onions quite
  finely.  Put both ingredients into a large pan and pour on the vinegar.
  Then lightly bruise the whole coriander seeds.  Add the seeds direct to the
  pan if you want to include them in the chutney.  I love their spicy bite
  but some people complain that the seeds stick between their teeth, so you
  may prefer to tie them in a piece of buttermuslin and remove before
  potting.  Bring the contents of the pan slowly to boiling point, cover and
  simmer gently for 20 minutes or so to start softening the onion.
  
  Add the dried fruits, sugar, curry powder and 1 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Stir to
  mix well.  Then continue simmering - this time without a lid - for 1 1/2
  hours or so until the rhubarb has pulped down completely, the flavour is
  mellow, and the colour is rich and the consistency is thick. Stir the
  chutney occasionally as it cooks to prevent sticking, particularly towards
  the end.  Pot in warm sterilised jars and allow to mature for at least one
  month before eating.  The longer you can resist eating this chutney the
  better it seems to taste.

      Title: Mushroom Croustades
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Wholemeal cottage loaf rolls        3 oz Butter
      1 lb Small cap mushrooms                 1 sm Garlic clove
    1/4 pt Double cream                             Fresh rosemary
 
  Cut the knobs off the rolls and reserve as lids.  Scoop out most of the
  crumb from the rolls, taking care not to pierce the crusts.  Crush the
  garlic with a pinch of salt, about 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped rosemary and
  a good grinding of black pepper.  Mash these flavourings into 2 1/2 oz
  butter and spread it thickly over the insides of the hollowed-out rolls.
  
  Season the cream generously with salt and pepper, add 1/2 teaspoon fresh
  chopped rosemary and leave in a cool place to infuse.  Slice the mushrooms
  thickly, and heat the oven to 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.
  
  Sit the rolls on a baking tray and put the lids beside them.  Bake for 10
  minutes until heated through and slightly crisp.  Meanwhile heat a large
  frying pan.  Add 1/2 oz butter (don't be tempted to use more) and, when the
  foam dies down, saute the mushrooms. Cook them, stirring frequently, for
  4-5 minutes to reduce them and intensify their flavour.  Pour on the cream
  and let it bubble up for a few seconds.  Turn and stir the mushrooms for a
  minute or so until every slice is coated with the scant but richly
  flavoured sauce.
  
  Away from the heat, check and adjust seasoning.  Pile the creamy mixture
  into the freshly baked croustades, top with the lids and serve straight
  away with a large green (or tomato) salad on the side.

      Title: Quails on Mushrooms
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Plump young quails                       Lemon juice
      6    Big flat mushrooms; plus...              Parsley
      6 oz Mushrooms for the stuffing               Chives
      6 oz Butter                                   Tarragon
      3    Garlic cloves (or more)        
 
  To make the duxelles, first chop the 6 oz mushrooms plus the stalks from
  the big flat mushrooms on which you will sit the quails.  Chop finely,
  using a knife, not a food processor.  Mix in 1 very finely chopped garlic
  clove, about 9 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, 3 tablespoons snipped
  chives and 1 heaped tablespoon fresh tarragon (or a generous 1 1/2 teaspoon
  dried tarragon if fresh is not available).  Cook the mixture in a little
  butter over moderate heat for 3 minutes or so, stirring often. Season well
  with salt, pepper and about 2 teaspoons lemon juice.
  
  Let the duxelles cool before using it to stuff the birds.  Spread it gently
  between the flesh and the skin, all over the breast area, to plump up the
  quails prettily.  Secure the flap of neck skin under each bird with a
  wooden toothpick.  If the skin is torn, put the stuffing into the body
  cavities instead.  Tie up the legs of each bird to keep it neatly shaped.
  
  Make about 5 oz garlic butter and reserve it.  Choose a roasting tin or
  baking dish just large enough to take the 6 flat mushrooms side by side.
  
  When ready to cook, melt a nugget of the garlic butter in the roasting tin.
  Turn the birds in it to coat them with fat, then arrange them, breast down,
  on a rack suspended across the roasting tin.  Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas
  mark 7 for 15 minutes.
  
  Put the mushrooms in the tin, arranging them gill side up, and dot them
  with the rest of the garlic butter.  Put the rack of quails back on top of
  the tin and turn the birds breast side up. Position the birds carefully,
  placing each one above a mushroom so that the meat juices will drip on to
  the mushrooms during cooking.  Bake for 20 minutes or so until the birds
  and mushrooms are perfectly cooked.
  
  Sit the birds on the mushrooms and serve straight away, or cover and keep
  hot at 250 F (120 C) gas mark 1/2 until ready to serve.  Rice, couscous or
  burghul, and crisp peppery watercress go well with this dish.

    1/2 lb Queens (bay scallops)                    Fresh parsley
    1/4 pt Milk                            1 1/2 tb Butter
    1/4 pt Single cream or jersey milk     1 1/2 tb Flour
           Tarragon vinegar                         Fried breadcrumbs; -OR-
           Anchovy essence                          Triangles of fried bread
 
  Slice the mushrooms thickly.  Put them into a pan with the cold milk (and
  cream if using).  Three-quarters cover the pan and bring quickly to a fast
  simmer.   Add the bay leaf and a little salt and reduce the heat to very
  low.  Three-quarters cover the pan again and leave to stew gently for 5-6
  minutes.  Strain to separate the liquid from the mushrooms, discard the bay
  leaf and keep the mushrooms warm in a very low oven.
  
  Make a smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour and creamy mushroom cooking
  liquor.  Stir in at least 1/2 teaspoon each tarragon vinegar and anchovy
  essence.  Leave to simmer for 2-3 minutes then season to taste with salt
  and pepper.  Quickly stir in the queens and immediately reduce heat to low.
  Half cover the pan and cook for just 5 minutes.  Stir occasionally during
  this time and be sure to keep the heat very low - only a very occasional
  bubble should break the surface of the sauce or the shellfish may toughen.
  
  Draw the pan away from the heat, quickly stir in the mushrooms and check
  seasoning.  Then turn the contents of the pan into a warmed gratin dish (or
  divide it between warmed scallop shells for an elegant first course).
  Sprinkle with parsley and garnish with fried crumbs or triangles of fried
  bread.  Serve alone as a first course, or as a main course accompanied by
  some green beans and a little rice or a loaf of warm French bread.
  
  Serves 2 as a greedy feast, 3 as a main course, or 6 as an appetizer.

      Title: Filo Mushroom Pies
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 42 servings
 
      1 pk Filo pastry sheets                  2 ts Coriander seeds
    3/4 lb Flat mushrooms (w/o stalks)              - toasted & lightly crushed
    1/2 lb Onions                                   Butter or oil
      7 oz Feta cheese                         2 sm Eggs
      2 ts Whole cumin                    
 
  Chop the onion finely and soften it in a little butter or oil, then fry
  hard until frazzled.  Remove and reserve.  Dice the mushrooms and fry them
  in the fat remaining in the pan; stir and turn them as necessary to drive
  off most of their moisture and to concentrate flavour.  Mix the two
  vegetables together and season with plenty of salt and pepper.  Stir in the
  cumin, coriander and grated cheese.  When cool bind with the beaten eggs.
  
  Unwrap the pastry one sheet at a time.  Keep the rest covered with a damp
  cloth to prevent drying out.  Cut each sheet into strips about 3 x 10
  inches long and brush on one side only with melted butter.  Put one rounded
  metal teaspoonful of the mixture near the short edge of the buttery side of
  the first pastry strip - about 1 inch from the bottom and slightly to the
  left-hand side.  Fold the bottom right-hand corner of the pastry diagonally
  over the filling to make a triangle.  Continue folding the pastry at right
  angles up the whole lenghth of the strip so you end up with a neat little
  triangular parcel.  Make more little pies in the same way until all the
  filling is used up.
  
  To cook, simply brush the pies all over with melted butter or oil, arrange
  them side by side on baking trays and bake at 350-375 F (180-190 C) gas
  mark 4/5 for about 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden and crisp.  It is
  best to turn the pies over after the first 10 minutes and brush with more
  butter or oil.  For even crisper results the pies can be deep-fried.

      Title: Spinach, Mushroom & Anchovy Salad
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     10 oz Spinach                             1    Mozzarella cheese
     10 oz Small cap mushrooms                 6 tb Olive oil
      2 oz Anchovy fillets (canned)           12 sl French bread, 1/2" thick
      2    Lemons                         
 
  Wash and dry the spinach, discard the stalks and put the leaves into a
  shallow salad bowl.  Put the canned anchovies and their oil into a large
  saucepan.  Add the olive oil, warm very gently and crush the anchovies with
  a wooden spoon so they dissolve and disintegrate.  Lightly toast the French
  bread on one side only.  Paint the untoasted side with a little of the
  anchovy oil, then grill until gilded.
  
  Add 2 teaspoons lemon juice and a good grinding of pepper to the anchovy
  mixture remaining in the pan.  Slice the mushrooms thickly and add them to
  the salad bowl.  Pour on the anchovy dressing while still warm (use a
  plastic-bladed spatula to get every last drop formt he pan) and toss
  gently.
  
  Slice the mozzarella and add it to the salad just before serving.  Garnish
  with the toasts or hand round separately, and offer wedges of lemon as
  well.

      Title: Crowdie Butter with Garlic and Parsley
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Garlic
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 pt Full cream milk                     1    Garlic clove
      2 ts Rennet (or follow instruct.)        1 tb Parsley
    1/2 ts Salt                                2 oz Butter
    1/2 ts Black pepper                   
 
  This is not the usual oat gruel, but a fresh white cheese, naturally
  soured, or turned with rennet.  It needs a little livening - with herbs or
  spark it up with wild garlic.
  
  Heat the milk (100 F, 40 C).  Stir in the rennet.  Leave in a warm place
  until the milk junkets.  Line a sieve with muslin wrung out in boiling
  water. Set over a bowl and let it drain until crumbly.  Work in the
  seasoning, herbs and butter.  Yields 5-6 oz.

      Title: Skirlie with Mushrooms
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Mushrooms (wild if possible)        1 lb Medium oatmeal
      5 oz Good meat dripping                       Salt and black pepper
      2    Onions                         
 
  Skirlie is only worth making with good drippings from roasted meat.
  Chrissie remembers that sometimes the cook at the big house would dole out,
  to people who wanted it, the wonderful dripping that had been used for the
  umpteen big roasts.  I like skirlie as a kind of risotto, with wild
  chanterelles that grow in profusion all over the island.  The mixture makes
  an excellent stuffing for a boned shoulder of lamb.
  
  Wipe and slice the mushrooms.  Skin and slice the onion thinly.
  
  Fry the mushrooms in 1 oz dripping in a wide frying pan.  Remove them and
  reserve.  Heat the rest of the dripping.  Fry the onion.  When the onions
  are soft but not brown, turn up the heat.
  
  Add the oatmeal, turn it in the drippings and brown a bit.  Throw in the
  mushrooms.  Add salt and black pepper to taste.  Serve hot.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Medium oatmeal                    1/2 oz Dripping or lard
      1 ts Salt                                3 tb Hot water (or more)
 
  Sift salt and oatmeal in a roomy bowl.  Put on the gridle or a heavy frying
  pan to heat.  Bring the water to the boil with the fat.  Pour into a well
  in the oatmeal.  Work into a stiff dough and cut in half.  Roll out on a
  floured board to the size of a dinner plate and about 1/8-inch thick. Cut
  into quarters or farles.
  
  Test the gridle's heat by holding your hand over it.  Lay on one of the
  quartered rounds.  When the farles are ready, the surface stops steaming
  and begins to look dry and white.  Turn them and do the other side.  Dry
  off the oatcakes and lightly brown the edges in a hot oven or under the
  grill - they should curl up to the fire to prove that you have made your
  own.

      Title: Poached Salmon with Lobster Butter
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1    Whole 7-8 lb. salmon                     Salt

-------------------------------FOR THE BUTTER-------------------------------
    1/2    Lemon (juice only)                  4 tb Reduced lobster stock *
      1    Green-black lobster brain OR        6 oz Butter
 
  *Note: Lobster stock should be made from shells and heads, then heavily
  reduced to make 3-4 tablespoons.
  
  Scale, gut and wipe the fish.  Rub the inside cavity with salt.  If you
  have a fish kettle, steam the salmon whole over boiling water for 30-35
  minutes (making sure the water is kept topped up).  Or wrap the fish in
  lightly oiled foil and bake it in the oven for an hour at 325 F (170 C) gas
  mark 3.  Leave it to rest while you make the butter.
  
  Warm the lemon juice in a small basin over a saucepan of simmering water.
  Beat in the nuggets of cold butter, adding more as each one melts.  Do this
  gently - it can split if you overheat it (revive it with a quick splash of
  cold water).  When you have an unctuous smooth sauce like thin cream, sieve
  and whisk in the green goo from the head of the lobster - which immediately
  turns the butter a wonderful orange-pink.
  
  Serve the salmon when it is just cool but still sweet-flavoured and full of
  its own juices, with piping hot baked potatoes and warm lobster butter.

      Title: Lobster Tart
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
---------------------------------THE PASTRY---------------------------------
      8 oz Flour                               3 oz Cold butter
      3 oz Cold lard                           3 tb Ice-cold water (or more)

--------------------------------THE FILLING--------------------------------
      1    Live lobster *                    1/2 pt Milk
      5    Eggs **                           1/2 pt Single cream
 
  *Note: the lobster should be good and lively.  A "cripple" - that is, one
  with only one claw for which you should pay less - will do fine for this
  dish. ** Leave out one of the egg whites, it is not needed for this recipe.
  
  Make the pastry first.  Sieve the flour with the salt into a roomy bowl.
  Chop the lard and butter into the flour with a sharp knife.  Finish rubbing
  in the fat to flour with the tips of your fingers.  Work in enough ice-cold
  water to give you a ball of soft (but not sticky) dough.  Cover with
  cling-film and leave the dough to rest in a cool place for half an hour or
  so.  Bring a panful of salted water to the boil - enough to swim the
  lobster.  Kill the lobster (or have you fishmonger do so) with a knife
  slipped in behind its head.  Or plunge the creature in the boiling water
  and hold it under with a wooden spoon (lobsters do drown).
  
  Cook the lobster for 3-4 minutes - just long enough to turn the shell
  scarlet and make the lobster easier to skin.  Drain it, sever the head and
  cut in half, taking care to save the greenish black brain (rather like
  liquid seaweed).  This will turn anything into which it is stirred
  wonderful sunny scarlet as it cooks.  Reserve the brain for making lobster
  butter.  Otherwise it can go into the tart filling.
  
  Remove the lobster meat from the body, claws and head (leave out the dark
  intestine which runs right down the body - and the stomach at the top of
  the head).  Slice the body meat into medallions.  Leave the claw meat
  whole.
  
  Bake the tart-case blind (lined with foil weighted with dried beans instead
  of filling) in a medium oven, 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5, for 10 minutes.
  
  Beat the milk, cream and eggs together and season.  Pour the mixture into
  the cooled tart tin.  Arrange the lobster pieces over all.  Bake at 400 F
  (200 C) gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, until the egg-filling is set.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Tart pastry                         4    Spring onions
      3 oz Grated cheese*                      4 tb (heaped) chopped parsley
      2 oz Fresh leaf spinach                  5    Eggs (less 1 white)

      1 lg Leek                              1/2 pt Single cream
 
  *Note: Scottish Cheddar is excellent used in this recipe. ** Greens may be
  sorrel, dandelion, nettle tops and/or watercress.
  
  Make the tart as in the Lobster Tart recipe, replacing the lobster with the
  greens, washed and shredded, but not cooked.  Stir in the cheese before
  cooking.

      Title: Hebridean Scotch Broth
 Categories: Soups/stews
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Neck of mutton *                    1 lg Carrot
      3 pt Water                               1 sl White cabbage (1/2")
      1 ts Salt                                1 lg Leek
      3 oz Barley                                   Black pepper
      1 oz Onion                                    Parsley; to finish
      1    Piece Swedish turnip (5 oz)    
 
  *Note: Neck of mutton may be either whole or in chops (use lamb only if you
  have to).
  
  Start to cook this dish the day before serving.  Boil the neck of mutton in
  a large covered pan in 2-1/2 pints lightly salted water for 2 hours (or
  more if the meat needs it).  Skim off all the scum and the excess fat as it
  rises to the surface of the water.
  
  Take out the meet when it is tender.  Put in the barley and leave it
  soaking in the stock overnight.  Next day, bring the stock and barley back
  to the boil.  Prepare and dice all the vegetables except the leeks to the
  stock and cook for another 60 minutes.  Add the leeks, cut into fine rings,
  10 minutes before the end of cooking.
  
  If you want to have the meat in the stew, strip it off the bones, cut into
  small pieces and return it to the soup before reheating thoroughly.
  
  Put a tablespoon of parsley in each plate, and pour in the soup.  If you
  prefer a two-dish meal, serve the meat as a main course afterwards with
  potatoes - Golden Wonder are Chrissie's preferred variety.  Bake the
  potatoes if they are mature.  Or boil them in their jackets if they are
  new.  For really fluffy, floury boiled potatoes, Chrissie cooks hers whole
  and unpeeled (never cut a Golden Wonder) for 12-15 minutes, depending on
  average size.  Then drain out all but a little of the water, lid the pan
  tightly and steam the potatoes for another 10 or 15 minutes, shaking
  regularly, until they are dry and floury in texture.

      Title: Carrageen Pudding with Rhubarb and Rosehip Jelly
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 pt Milk                                1    Egg
      1    Strip lemon peel                    2    Sticks rhubarb **
    1/2 oz Prepared dried carrageen *          4 tb Rosehip or redcurrant jelly
      1 tb Sugar                          
 
  *Note: Carrageen is a purple-brown or green fronded seaweed common on
  Scottish beaches on the mid-tide line.  It can be used to set and
  delicately flavour a jelly or thicken a soup.  If you gather your own
  fresh, you will need about 2 oz to set a pint of milk.  Dried carrageen is
  available in health-food stores, or Chinese supermarkets in processed form,
  as agar-agar. **Rhubarb sticks should be sliced and lightly poached with
  additional sugar.
  
  Bring the milk to the boil with the lemon rind.  Stir in the carrageen and
  cook for a couple of minutes until the milk thickens enough to coat the
  back of a wooden spoon.  Add sugar.
  
  Allow the mixture to cool until it is at blood temperature (100 F, 40 C).
  Whisk the egg till frothy and then whisk in the warm milk until smooth.
  Pour the mixture through a sieve into a cold-wetted ring-mould.  Then put
  it in the fridge to set - it will only take about 1/2 hour.
  
  Run hot water over the outside of the mould and turn out the jelly.  Fill
  the middle of the ring with a ladleful of rhubarb compote and surround with
  a little scarlet sauce of rosehip or redcurrant jelly melted in a little
  hot water.

      Title: Cloutie Dumpling with Ginger Cream
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
--------------------------------THE DUMPLING--------------------------------
      1 lb Self-raising flour                       - cored, unpeeled, grated
      6 oz Fresh brown breadcrumbs             1    Carrot; grated
      4 oz Soft brown sugar                    8 oz Currants
      1 ts Mixed spice                         8 oz Sultanas
           A little extra cinnamon             1    Egg
      5 oz Vegetable fat or butter           1/4 pt Milk
      1 tb Black treacle                       1    18" sq. clean cotton sheet
      2    Apples                        

--------------------------------GINGER CREAM--------------------------------
      8 oz Crabbe's Green Ginger Wine        1/4 pt Single cream
      3    Egg yolks                      
 
  Sieve the flour and mix it with the breadcrumbs, brown sugar and spices.
  Melt the butter or vegetable fat gently with the treacle.  Mix the
  breadcrumbs, currants and sultanas.  Beat the egg and milk together and add
  to the dry ingredients, with the grated carrot and apple - use you hands.
  Add more milk if necessary to give a soft mixture which drops easily from
  the spoon.
  
  Put a square of cotton sheet in the pot of boiling water with an upturned
  plate on the bottom.  Take out the scalded cloth, spinkle it with flour and
  put in the dumpling.  Draw up the edges, and tie up firmly with white
  string, leaving enough room for the pudding to expand.  Lower the dumpling
  back into the boiling pan.  Keep water topped up.  Bring back to the boil.
  Boil steadily but gently for 4 hours.  It can be longer but it shouldn't be
  less.
  
  Remove the dumpling and dip it staight in and out of cold water.  Unwrap
  the dumpling on to a serving plate.  The skin will initially be white from
  the flour.  Put the dumpling on its plate in a very low oven to dry off for
  20 minutes, when it will develop a fine, dark glossy skin.
  
  Meanwhile, make the ginger cream.  Beat the wine with the egg yolks over
  hot water until the mixture is thick, white and fluffy.  Stir in 1/4 pint
  single cream.  Serve it in a pretty glass jug, with the hot pudding.
  
  The dumpling cuts wonderfully rich and dark.  Leftover slices are delicious
  fried in butter - lovely with cream for a special tea-time treat.

      Title: Polenta with Tomatoes & Olives
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8 oz Polenta                             3 oz Stoned olives (optional)

----------------------------FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE----------------------------
  1 1/4 lb (generous) canned tomatoes               Garlic, bay, rosemary, thyme
      1 lg Onion                                    -- (or herbs of your choice)
      1 tb Olive oil                      
 
  Bring 1-3/4 pints salted water to the boil.  Reduce the heat to low and add
  the grain as though you were making porridge: let the polenta trickle
  slowly through your fingers and stir the contents of the pan very
  vigorously all the time to prevent lumps forming.  Cook over the gentlest
  possible heat for about 20 minutes, stirring more or less continuously -
  like porridge and semolina, polenta is a great sticker.   The mixture is
  ready when it begins to come away from the sides of the pan, is perfectly
  smooth and so thick that your wrist aches from stirring.  Away from the
  heat beat in 1 tablespoon oil, the stoned olives if using them, and some
  salt and pepper.  Use the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to grease the interior
  of an 11-12 inch frying pan.  Turn the polenta into the frying pan, pack it
  down smoothly and level the top with an oiled spoon.  Set aside for a
  couple of hours until the polenta is cold and solid.  Loosen it with a
  palette knife, turn it out of the pan and cut into 6-8 wedges.
  
  To make the sauce, chop the onion finely and sweat it in the oil for 10-12
  minutes.  Add the roughly chopped tomatoes and their juices, several cloves
  of finely chopped garlic and a little bouquet of rosemary, bay and thyme,
  or plenty of well-flavoured herbs of your choice.  Let the mixture bubble
  away gently for 40 minutes or so, just stirring occasionally, until reduced
  to a rich and fragrant sauce.  Remove the bouquet of herbs, season with
  salt and pepper and add extra fresh chopped herbs to taste.
  
  Fry the wedges of polenta in very hot olive oil or unsalted butter, or a
  mixture of the two, for 4-5 minutes on each side until lightly crusted and
  heated right through.  Serve piping hot with the garlicky tomato sauce, and
  with a bowl of olives or grated Parmesan if you wish.  In the Veneto
  polenta sometimes accompanies small silvery fried fish, or a dish of
  Fergato alla Veneziana.  Quail or other tiny game birds threaded on to
  skewers and cooked on a spit, or a saute of chicken livers, and grilled
  sausages, are other good choices but polenta can be served on its own just
  as well.

  2 1/2 oz Plain white flour                        Paprika & cayenne pepper
  2 1/2 oz Butter                        

------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
      1 lb Onions                          2 1/2 oz Cheddar cheese
    1/4 pt Soured cream                        1    Whole egg
  2 1/2 oz Butter                              1    Egg yolk
 
  *Note: Medium oatmeal may be used instead of oat flakes if preferred.
  
  Mix the oats, flours, cheese and a pinch each of salt, paprika and cayenne.
  Cut then rub in the fat, bind with water and leave out to rest.
  
  Peel, quarter and slice the onions wafer thin.  Turn them in melted butter,
  cover and leave to sweat over very gentle heat for 20 minutes or so until
  meltingly tender, just stirring occasionally.
  
  This pastry is rather difficult to handle so it is best to divide it in
  half and roll out in two batches.  Keep the other half covered meanwhile.
  Use the pastry to line little mincepie tins (or individual 4-inch fluted
  flan tins if you prefer).  Don't worry too much if the pastry tears; patch
  it together by pressing it with your fingertips.  Blind bake on a
  pre-heated baking sheet at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6, allowing 12 minutes
  with greaseproof paper and beans, then 12 minutes without the lining.
  
  When the onions are beautifully soft, remove the lid and cook over
  increased heat for several minutes until they are a rich golden brown.
  Season generously with salt and black pepper, add a dash of cayenne and
  paprika and mix well.  Then tip the contents of the pan into a sieve placed
  over a bowl to drain off the buttery juices and to cool the onions
  slightly.  When the pastry cases are cooked, beat the eggs with the soured
  cream, add onions and check seasoning.  Spoon the mixture into the tarts,
  sprinkle the grated cheese on top and bake at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for
  20-25 minutes until the filling is deliciously puffed up and golden.

      Title: Barley Broth with Chicken
 Categories: Soups/stews, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 oz Pot barley                        1/4 lb Mushrooms
  2 1/2 pt Good quality chicken stock          2    Chicken livers, if available
      1    Lemon                                    Cold cooked chicken meat *
      1    Fat garlic clove                    5 tb Coarsley chopped parsley
      2    Leeks                               1 sm Knob butter
 
  *Note: The recipe calls for 1-2 chicken livers, if available, and "shreds
  of cold cooked chicken meat, if available".
  
  Grate the zest of the lemon very finely and reserve it.  Put the barley
  into a soup pan, add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and cold chicken stock. Bring
  to the boil, cover and simmer for about 40 minutes until the barley is
  tender with just a hint of bite to the centre of the grain.  Add the
  chicken meat, if used, to the pan towards the end of this time to heat it
  through gently but thoroughly.
  
  When the barley is nearly ready, slice the mushrooms thickly, and slice the
  leeks (tender green parts as well as the white) very thinly indeed so that
  the leaves fall into ribbony shreds.  Cut the chicken livers, if available,
  into 2 to 3 pieces and saute them briefly in the butter until crusty on the
  outside but still pink within.  Fry the mushrooms in the fat remaining in
  the pan then reduce the heat and cook the leeks gently for 2 to 3 minutes,
  just shaking occasionally.  Then add contents of the frying pan to the soup
  pan.  Add the mushrooms and check seasoning.
  
  Put the chicken livers into a warmed soup tureen and crush with a fork to
  make a coarse paste.  Add the finely chopped garlic, the lemon zest and
  most of the parsley.  Pour on the piping hot soup, stir to mix well,
  sprinkle the rest of the parsley on top and serve.
  
  Note: If the soup is not served straight away, but allowed to get cold, the
  barley will go on swelling and softening; when reaheated the dish then
  seems more like a stew than a soup.  I like it this way but you may prefer
  to lift out the grain and cool it down separately from the rest of the
  soup.

      Title: Spinach & Stilton Pancakes
 Categories: Breads, Cheese/eggs, Vegetarian, Pancakes, Breakfast
      Yield: 18 servings
 
------------------------------FOR THE PANCAKES------------------------------
      2 oz Buckwheat flour                     2 tb Butter; melted
      2 oz Plain white flour                 1/4 pt Milk
      2    Eggs                              1/4 pt Water

------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
      2 lb Fresh spinich                       2 oz Walnut pieces
      1 lg Onion                                    Butter
      3 oz Stilton cheese                      1    Garlic sliver

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
      1 oz Butter                            1/4 pt Double cream
      1 oz Plain white flour                   2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
    1/2 pt Stock                               1 ts (heaped) Dijon mustard
 
  Make a smooth batter with the flours, eggs, milk and water, then stir in
  the cool melted butter for extra richness and to prevent sticking during
  cooking.  Use a 6-inch pan and make thin pancakes in the usual way, but be
  sure to stir the batter vigorously in between making each pancake or all
  the buckwheat flour will sink to the bottom of the mixture.  If preparing
  ahead, cool the pancakes then stack them (interleaved with greaseproof
  paper) and wrap in a foil parcel.
  
  To make the filling, wash and boil or steam the spinach until just tender.
  Chop it and squeeze out all the liquid (save the juices for a soup).  Chop
  the onion finely and sweat it in a knob of butter until it's deliciously
  soft.  Stir in the spinach, season with a little salt, lots of pepper and
  the garlic.  Toast the walnuts and crumbled Stilton into the spinach
  mixture to give it savoury flavour and bite.  Stuff the pancakes with the
  mixture, roll them up neatly and pile them into a lightly buttered gratin
  dish.  Cover with foil and heat through in the oven for 25-30 minutes at
  400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.
  
  Make a smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock (preferably good
  chicken stock) and cream.  Let it simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring once
  or twice, then season with the cheese, mustard and salt and pepper. If the
  sauce is made ahead, reheat it in a double-boiler for serving, then pour it
  over the dish of pancakes just before bringing to table.

      Title: Cocktail Crunch
 Categories: Appetizers, India
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 oz Rye flakes                          1 ts (heaped) coriander seeds
      3 oz Jumbo oat flakes                    1 ts (heaped) cumin seeds
      3 oz Barley flakes                       1 tb Garam marsala
      3 oz Wheat flakes                        1 ts Tumeric
      3 oz Peanut kernals                      3 tb Sesame oil
           -- not salted or dry-roast          3 tb Peanut oil
      2 oz Flaked almonds                      1 tb Soy sauce
      2 oz Sunflower seeds                     5 tb Water
 
  Crush the coriander and cumin - lightly.  Mix them with the nuts and seeds
  on two baking trays.  Set the oven to 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5 and put the
  baking trays into the oven while it heats up.  Meanwhile measure the flaked
  grains and mix them together in a large bowl.  Put into a cup the garam
  marsala, tumeric, a good grinding of black pepper, a scrunch of sea salt,
  the soy, both sorts of oil and the water.
  
  When the oven has reached the required temperature, stir the nut and seed
  mixture with the flaked grains.  Beat the spicy oil-and-water mixture with
  a fork to emulsify it, pour it on to the dry ingredients and stir for 2
  minutes.  Spread the mixture out on to the baking trays and bake for 40
  minutes until golden.  Swap the positions of the trays in the oven at least
  once during this time and stir the mixture occasionally to encourage even
  cooking.  Let the mixture become cold and crunchy before storing in an
  airtight jar.  It keeps well for about a month.  Makes enough to fill one
  jar.

      Title: Baked Trout with Yoghurt and Herbs
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    6-8 oz trouts                       2 tb Chopped fennel
  7 1/2 fl Greek strained yoghurt              1 ts Fresh chopped thyme
  2 1/2 fl Whipping cream                      1 ts Fresh chopped oregano
      2 tb Fresh chopped parsley               1 ts Fresh chopped tarragon
      2 tb Chopped chives                           Clarified or unsalted butter
 
  Choose a baking dish or other shallow oven-proof dish suitable for bringing
  to table, which is just large enough to take the trout in a single layer
  when they are arranged head to tail.  Thoroughly dry the fish with plenty
  of kitchen paper.  Make a frying pan very hot, barely smear it with fat and
  fry the fish briefly, one or two at a time, just long enough to brown their
  skins well on both sides.  Transfer the fish to the ovenproof dish,
  arranging them neatly.  Cover and store in a cool place.
  
  Chop the herbs and mix them gently in a small saucepan.  Measure the
  yoghurt and cream and pour them over the herbs.  Add plenty of pepper and
  some salt and stir to mix well.  Cover and leave to infuse.  Everything up
  to this stage can be done in advance, but be sure to bring both the pan of
  sauce and the dish of trout back to room temperature about 1 hour before
  they are to be put back into the oven for cooking.  (Foods that are
  transferred straight from the fridge to cooker take a very long time to
  heat through properly.)
  
  About 1/2 hour before you plan to serve the trout, bring the yoghurt-and-
  herb mixture very slowly to simmering point, stirring all the while.  Pour
  the aromatic mixture over the fish, cover the dish and bake at 350 F (180
  C) gas mark 4 for 20-25 minutes until the fish are piping hot and cooked
  through.  (To check a trout for readiness, insert the tip of a knife into
  its flesh just behind the head.)  Serve with steamed new potatoes and other
  young summer vegetables such as carrots and peas.

      Title: Kennet Fried Trout
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 sm Trout, (6-8 oz each)                2 oz Unsalted or clarified butter
      2    Rashers streaky bacon               1    Lemon
      1 tb (heaped) coarse oatmeal                  A little plain flour
 
  Rub the skins of the cleaned and dried trout very gently with a good
  grinding of pepper - this makes the rich skin deliciously piquant when
  crisply fried - then dust lightly with flour and salt.  Warm a frying pan
  large enough to take the two fish.  Toast the oatmeal in it, or, for a
  richer dish, fry it.  Remove and reserve.  Cut the bacon into snippets; fry
  gently until the fat runs, then increase heat to crisp the bacon a little.
  Remove and keep hot.  Dice the butter and add 1-1/2 oz of it to the pan.
  When the butter foam dies down add the fish.  Press them down lightly to
  ensure they lie very flat, touching the pan base everywhere. After 4-5
  minutes steady cooking in the bubbling butter, the skin on the underside of
  the fish should be crisp and golden brown.  Turn them carefully and fry on
  the second side in the same way.  Put the cooked fish on to warmed plates,
  scatter the bacon and oatmeal over them and keep hot.
  
  Wipe out the pan with kitchen paper.  Melt the remaining butter and cook to
  a rich shade of gold.  Quickly add generous 1 teaspoon lemon juice and a
  little salt and pepper.  Swirl to mix well, pour over the trout and serve
  immediately with wedges of lemon.

      Title: Riverside Kedgeree
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Cold cooked salmon or trout*        8 oz Brown rice
      1 lg Cucumber                            2 oz Butter
      1 bn Watercress                               A little caster sugar
    1/4 lb Shelled young peas                       A little tarragon vinegar
 
  *Note: Salmon, sea trout or river trout may be used (farmed trout is
  unsuitable - its texture is too soft).
  
  Peel and seed the cucumber and cut the flesh into pieces no larger than
  matchsticks.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and caster sugar and 1
  teaspoon tarragon vinegar.  Toss lightly and set aside for at least 40
  minutes, or all day if you prefer, to draw out some of the cucumber juices.
  Drain well and pat dry.
  
  Cook the rice in double its volume of boiling salted water or, better
  still, in fish stock.  It will take about 35 minutes to become tender.
  Towards the end of this time cook the vegetables.  Boil the peas in a
  little lightly sugared water.  Melt the butter in a flameproof casserole,
  add the sticks of cucumber and cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes,
  just stirring occasionally.  Break the skinned and boned fish into big
  flaky chunks.  Lay the fish on top of the cucumber - don't stir it in.
  Cover the casserole and reduce heat as low as possible.  Leave to cook,
  just shaking the casserole occasionally, until the cucumber is tender and
  the fish is well heated through - 4 minutes or so.  Meanwhile put the
  watercress into a food-processor and reduce it to green flecks.
  
  To assemble the kedgeree, add the prepared watercress, peas and cooked rice
  to the buttery fish and cucumber mixture.  Immediately draw the casserole
  away from the heat and season it generously with sea salt and freshly
  ground black pepper.  Toss the ingredients gently but thoroughly to mix
  them well and serve straight away with a large fresh green salad, or with a
  tomato salad if you prefer. Serves 4-6.

      Title: Creamy Trout Mousse
 Categories: Appetizers, Fish/sea
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      2    Trouts (6 oz ea. cleaned) *     1 1/4 ts Gelatine powder (or more)
      1    Whole egg                                Fresh parsley & tarragon
      1    Egg white                         1/2    Cucumber
    1/4 pt Olive or sunflower oil                   Caster sugar
      5 tb Creamy yoghurt                           Tarragon vinegar
      1 ts Dijon mustard                  
 
  *Note: In lieu of fresh trout, 1/2 lb cooked and flaked fish may be used.
  Serves 6 as an appetizer, or 3 as a light lunch.
  
  If using fresh trout, poach them in the oven at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4
  for 30 minutes, then cool, skin, bone and flake - there should be about 8
  ounces of cooked flesh.
  
  Separate the egg and use the yolk to make mayonnaise: season it with salt
  and pepper, gradually beat in the oil, then 1 teaspoon or so of vinegar to
  thin and flavour the sauce.
  
  Put the prepared fish into a food processor.  Add the mustard, yoghurt and
  1 heaped teaspoon each fresh chopped tarragon and parsley, and whizz to a
  perfectly smooth puree.  Soak the gelatine (more may be necessary in hot
  weather) in 3 tablespoons cold water, let it soften and swell, then
  dissolve over low heat.  Cool for a minute or two before adding the liquid
  gelatine to the fish puree: pour it on in a thin stream while the machine
  is running.  Carefully and gradually beat the fish puree into the
  mayonnaise.  Quickly whisk the egg whites to snowy peaks and fold them into
  the fish puree.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Divide the mixture
  between 6 ramekins or 3 small souffle dishes.  Cover and chill for 2-3
  hours until set to a soft cream.
  
  Seed the cucumber but do not peel.  Chop it finely, sprinkle it with 1/4
  teaspoon each salt and caster sugar and 1/2 teaspoon tarragon vinegar, and
  set aside for a couple of hours to draw out some of the cucumber juices.
  Drain and pat dry.  Top each mousse immediately before serving with a small
  spoonful of the cucumber - a good crunchy contrast to the soft textured
  mousse - and garnish with a tarragon leaf.  Oatcakes that have been gently
  warmed in the oven go well with this dish.

      Title: Spaghetti with Salmon and Sorrel (Or Spinach)
 Categories: Fish/sea, Pasta
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4 oz Cooked and flaked salmon            8 oz Fresh spaghetti
      1 oz Fresh sorrel (or spinach) *              Lemon juice and butter
      2 oz Broccoli florets                    2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
 
  *Note: Amount given for sorrel (or spinach) is for trimmed weight.
  
  Take some sorrel or spinach leaves and roll them up tightly, a few at a
  time.  Snip across with scissors to make fine green ribbony shreds.  Chop
  the broccoli florets into very small pieces indeed, and bring a large pan
  of salted water to the boil for cooking the pasta.
  
  Melt 2 oz butter in a flameproof casserole suitable for bringing to table.
  Add the broccoli, stir to coat with fat, cover with a lid and cook gently
  for just 1 minute.  Add a very generous grinding of pepper, some salt and 2
  teaspoons lemon juice (or quite a bit more lemon if using spinach). Shake
  the casserole to distribute the flavourings, then scatter the flaked fish
  over the broccoli but do not stir it in.  Cover and leave over very gentle
  heat for just 3 minutes or so.  Meanwhile cook the pasta.
  
  Draw the casserole away from the heat.  Add the well drained pasta, the
  Parmesan and most of the sorrel or spinach ribbons.  Toss quickly, gently
  and thoroughly so that every strand of pasta is anointed with butter and
  prettily flecked with the pink and green of the salmon and vegetables.
  Check the seasoning, sprinkle the remaining ribbons of greenery over the
  top and serve straight away, accompanied by wedges of lemon instead of the
  ubiquitous bowl of grated Parmesan cheese.

      Title: Scalloped Salmon or Trout
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Cold cooked salmon or trout     1 1/2 oz Flour
           - (sea or river trout)            1/2 pt Whole milk
    1/2 lb Florentine fennel                 1/4 pt Fish stock
           - (trimmed weight)                       Lemon juice
    1/2 lb Steaky bacon                             Dijon mustard
      2 oz Butter                                   Toasted or fried breadcrumbs
 
  Serves 8 as an appetizer, or 3-4 as a main course.
  
  Trim the fennel in the usual way, scraping away fibrous threads with a
  potato peeler, or remove and discard the outer layers if they are
  tired-looking or tough.  Chop the flesh into small chunks and toss in 1/2
  oz melted butter.  Half cover the pan and leave to cook gently for 10
  minutes just shaking the pan occasionally.  Add the bacon, cut into
  snippets, increase heat and cook, stirring frequently, for several minutes
  until the bacon is cooked and the fennel is steaked with gold.  Season with
  a good squeeze of lemon and plenty of pepper, and set aside to cool before
  mixing with the fish, which should be broken into large chunks.
  
  Make a sauce with 1-1/2 oz each butter and flour, the milk and the stock,
  and simmer gently, half covered, for about 10 minutes.  Away from the heat,
  season with scant 1 teaspoon mustard, a little salt and plenty of pepper.
  Gently fold in the fish mixture and divide between 8 small scallop shells
  or cocottes or put it all into one large gratin dish. Cover with foil and
  reheat in the oven straight away, or if preparing ahead, set aside in a
  cool place until close to serving time.  If the mixture is cold when it
  goes into the oven, it will probably need 25 minutes or so at 425 F (220 C)
  gas mark 7 to become thoroughly heated through. Stand the dish(es) on a
  pre-heated baking sheet to help speed things up. When thoroughly hot,
  remove the foil and sprinkle the fish mixture generously with freshly
  toasted or fried breadcrumbs immediately before serving.

      Title: Little Parcels of Trout
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3    Trout (8-9 oz ea cleaned wt)    2 1/2 oz Butter
    1/2 lb Courgettes                        1/2    Lemon
    1/2 lb Carrots                                  Fresh mint & chives
    1/4 lb Mangetout peas                 
 
  Cut the courgettes and carrots into matchstick shapes about 1 1/2 inch long
  and less than 1/4 inch wide.  Steam them, and the mangetout, but only
  briefly, not enough to tenderise them fully.  Use kitchen paper to blot
  surface moisture from the partially cooked vegetables and set aside ot
  become cold.
  
  Season the softened butter with sea salt and black pepper.  Beat in 1/2
  teaspoon lemon juice and 1 tablespoon or so each chopped chives and mint.
  Use some of the flavoured butter to grease sheets of greaseproof or
  bakewell paper.
  
  Clean and fillet the trout, remove any little bones and cut the flesh of
  each fish into four long strips.  Lay three strips side by side down the
  centre of each sheet of buttered greaseproof paper.  Dust with sea salt and
  grind some pepper over the fish.  Add a squeeze of lemon butter.  Lay the
  mixed vegetables on top, spreading them thinly and seasoning with salt and
  pepper between layers.  Dot with the rest of the butter and, finely, add a
  sprig or two of mint to each parcel.
  
  To close the parcels, first draw two sides of the paper up over the filling
  and fold into a double pleat on top.  Then "hem" the raw paper edges at the
  sides by turning them over twice, and secure with staples. The parcels
  should be fairly baggy.  Put each parcel on to an oeuf sur le plat dish or
  space them out in large gratin dishes or on baking trays. Chill until about
  1 1/2 hours before cooking, then bring back to room temperature.
  
  To cook, bake at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for about 15 minutes.  Let each
  person unwrap his or her parcel at table.  Hand round bowls of new potatoes
  steamed in their skins, plain undressed watercress, and Hollandaise sauce
  so that everyone can help themselves.

           -OR- smoked trout                        Fresh mint or watercress
  2 1/2 oz Chopped, toasted hazelnuts          2    Lemons
           -OR- walnuts                             A little sunflower oil
      1 lb Seedless grapes                   1/2 pt Creamy yoghurt (or more)
 
  Cook the rice in double its volume of fast boiling salted water.  Refresh
  it and dress it with 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon oil and plenty
  of salt and pepper.  Stir in the nuts and 5-6 tablespoons chopped mint or
  watercress.  (Watercress is good but mint is even better for this dish.)
  Press the mixture firmly into a lightly oiled ring mould, cover and chill
  for a couple of hours or more.
  
  Close to serving time, halve the grapes and toss them in the juice of half
  a lemon plus scant 1 tablespoon oil.  Add some mint or watercress sprigs.
  Skin, bone and flake the fish and mix it in gently.  Unmould the ring of
  rice, put some of the fish and grape mixture into the centre and garnish
  with sprigs of mint or watercress.  Serve the rest of the fish mixture in a
  separate bowl, and hand round the well-chilled yoghurt in a second bowl.

      Title: Turkish Chicken with Walnut Sauce
 Categories: Poultry, Sauces, Turkish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    3-1/2 to 4 lb chicken         

----------------------------POACHING FLAVOURINGS----------------------------
      2    Onions; sliced, unpeeled                 A few peppercorns
      1    Bouquet garni                            Coriander seeds
    1/2    Lemon (juice only)            

--------------------------------WALNUT SAUCE--------------------------------
      6 oz Walnut kernels                      1 bn Fresh coriander
  1 1/2 oz Crustless bread                     2 tb Walnut oil
  1 1/2 ts Well-toasted corinader seeds        1 tb Paprika
 
  Put the bird into a pan, add the flavourings and enough hot (not boiling)
  water to cover the thighs.  Poach for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours until tender.
  Let the bird cool in the pan, then skin and bone it.  Wrap the flesh to
  keep it succulent.  Return the chicken skin and bones to the pan and simmer
  for 2 hours more.  Strain and de-grease.  Reduce to 3/4 pints and cool.
  
  Scald or lightly toast the nuts and rub off the papery thin skins.  Then,
  using a spice or coffee mill, reduce the nuts and coriander seeds to a fine
  powder.  Process in small batches, adding the bread to minumise stickiness.
  Transfer the aromatic powder to a bowl and gradually blend in as much of
  the stock as is needed to make a creamy-textured masking sauce ~ you
  probably won't need it at all.
  
  Cut the meat into small strips.  Put them into a pretty dish, adding some
  of the sauce and a little fresh chopped coriander between layers.  Spoon
  the rest of the sauce over the top to cover the meat completely.  Just
  before serving, stir ther walnut oil into the paprika.  Drizzle the mixture
  over the dish in a decorative red pattern and place a little bouquet of
  fresh coriander in the centre.  Serve with rice and a green salad.

      Title: Love in Disguise
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Pigs' hearts                        2 ts Wine vinegar
      1 sm Onion                                    French mustard
      4 oz Fresh breadcrumbs                  15 oz Canned tomatoes
           Bay leaves                               A little stock
           Parsley                             2 oz Butter
      2    Lemons (zest only)                  1 oz Well-seasoned flour
      1    Egg; beaten with milk                    Few spoonfuls yoghurt (opt.)
      2 tb Milk; to beat with egg         
 
  You may get 2 or 3 large hearts for this weight or several smaller ones.
  Whatever the size, they will be slashed; this is normal.  Wash the hearts
  and trim away waste - fat, membrane, gristle and arteries.  Soak in lightly
  salted water for 10 minutes then rinse, drain and dry well.  Chop the onion
  finely and soften it in 1 oz butter.  Away from the heat stir in the
  breadcrumbs, lemon zest, 4 tablespoons parsley and lots of salt and pepper.
  Bind with the egg and milk.  Use the mixture to stuff the heart cavities,
  and secure the openings with toothpicks or cocktail sticks - there is no
  need to make perfect closures.
  
  Whizz the tomatoes in a blender, stir in the vinegar and add enough stock
  to make up to 1 pint.  Dust the hearts thoroughly with the well-seasoned
  flour.  Melt 1 oz butter in a flameproof casserole, stir in the leftover
  flour and let it brown a little.  Blend in the tomato mixture and make a
  smooth, bubbling hot sauce.  Lay the prepared hearts in the sauce and tuck
  the bay leaves among them.  Cover with greaseproof paper and the lid, and
  cook at 325 F (160 C) gas mark 3 for 1 hour.  Turn the hearts gently and
  continue cooking for 1 to 1-1/2 hours more until meat is beautifully
  tender.
  
  Transfer the hearts to a warmed serving dish.  Stir the mustard into the
  sauce, add salt and pepper to taste - and carefully blend in the yoghurt if
  liked.  Pour the sauce over the hearts, scatter lavishly with chopped
  parsley and serve with boiled potatoes or noodles.

      Title: Pork with Celery & Orange
 Categories: Meats, Pork/ham
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Lean end belly of pork              2    Garlic cloves; crushed
      2    Pig's kidneys, (5 oz each)               Parsley and rosemary
      3 sm Oranges                             1    Bay leaf
      1    Head of celery                           A little yeast extract
      1    Onion                                    Flour and dripping
 
  Halve and core the kidneys.  Soak them in acidulated water for 1 hour then
  drain and dry.  Bone the pork, reserve the rind and cut the flesh (there
  should be at least 1 lb.) into large cubes.  Grate the zest of all 3
  oranges and squeeze the juice from 2.  Measure the juice and add enough
  yeast extract dissolved in hot water to make 8 fl. oz. of liquid in total.
  
  Seal the pork briskly in a little hot fat and transfer to a casserole.
  Slice the kidneys thickly, dust with flour, brown in the hot fat and add to
  the casserole.  Tie together 3 sprigs of rosemary, 6 bruised parsley stalks
  and a bay leaf, and bury the bouquet among the meats.  Roughly chop the
  onion and fry it briefly.  Sprinkle on 1-1/2 tablespoons flour and pour on
  the liquid.  Bring to the boil, stirring, and add to the casserole. Add
  plenty of salt and pepper, the crushed garlic and orange zest. Cut the
  celery into large chunks and add it to the casserole - do not stir it in.
  Lay the pork rind, fat side down, on top of the celery, and put a sheet of
  greaseproof paper over that.  Cover with the lid and cook at 325 F (160 C)
  gas mark 3 for 1-1/2 hours, then at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for a further
  45 minutes.
  
  Remove and discard the paper, rind and bouquet of herbs.  Stir the
  casserole to mix the ingredients and add the flesh of the reserved orange,
  cut into V-shaped segments and ruthlessly stripped of all membrane.  Cover
  with fresh greaseproof paper and the lid; cool quickly and chill overnight.
  
  Remove surface fat and reheat the casserole gently but thoroughly for
  serving.  Check seasoning and garnish with fresh chopped parsley.

      Title: Cottagers' Meatloaf
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  1 1/8 lb Lean belly pork *                        Fresh chopped parsley
    3/4 lb Pig's liver                         1    Garlic clove; crushed w/salt
      6 oz Lean green streaky bacon            4 ts Lemon juice
      6 oz Grated carrot                       1 ts Lemon zest
      6 oz Fresh brown breadcrumbs           1/4 ts (generous) dried thyme
      2 sm Onions                            1/4 ts (generous) dried marjoram
      1 lg Green pepper                   
 
  *Note: Weight of pork is after trimming away bones, rind and excess fat.
  
  Mince the meats fairly finely, grate the carrot and chop the onion and
  green pepper very finely.  Mix all the ingredients very thoroughly with
  your hands and season well with salt and pepper.  Fry a small nugget to
  check seasoning and adjust to taste.  Oil a 2 lb loaf tin, line with
  greaseproof paper and oil again.  Pack the mixture into the tin.  Press it
  down well, dome the top of the meat nicely and press 2 or 3 bay leaves on
  top.
  
  Cover the tin with foil.  Stand it in a roasting pan and pour in enough
  boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the loaf tin.  Bake at 350 F
  (180 C) gas mark 4 for 1 hour.  Reduce temperature to 325 F (160 C) gas
  mark 3, remove foil lid and bake for a further 30 minutes.
  
  Cool the cooked meatloaf for 30 minutes, then tilt the tin and pour off the
  juices.  Set aside in a cold place overnight before serving to allow
  flavours to blend and mature.

      Title: Chicken Liver Stroganoff
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken livers                  1 1/2 oz Unsalted or clarified butter
    1/2 lb Cap mushrooms                     1/2 pt Soured cream
      2    Onions                              3 tb Fairly acid yoghurt
 
  Thoroughly heat a large saute or frying pan.  Add a scant 1/2 oz of the
  butter and tilt so that the fat runs sizzling all over the pan base.  Add
  the mushrooms (whole if small or sliced thickly if large) and saute over
  high heat for 5 minutes.  Remove and keep hot.
  
  Add the rest of the butter to the pan, then the onions which should be
  thinly sliced and pushed into rings.  Cook very gently indeed for 15-20
  minutes until beautifully softened.  Meanwhile stir the yoghurt into the
  soured cream and season very generously with salt and pepper; trim the
  chicken livers and pat them dry with kitchen paper.
  
  Lift the onions out of the pan with a slotted spoon, so all the buttery
  juices drip back into the pan, and keep them hot.  Increase the heat under
  the pan and saute the chicken livers for about 3 minutes so they become
  crusted with brown on the outside, but remain deliciously pink and tender
  within.
  
  Return the mushrooms and onions to the pan and immediately pour on the
  seasoned soured cream.  Let the sauce bubble up and cook for a few minutes
  until it is very hot, slightly reduced and thickened.  Stir gently every
  now and again to encourage the sauce to cling creamily to the meat and
  vegetables.  Check seasoning and serve without delay.  Green beans and
  triangles of fried bread go well with this dish, and I like to accompany it
  with plenty of crusty hot French bread to mop up every luscious drop of
  sauce.  More substantially, you could substitute rice or thin ribbons of
  pasta for the bread.

      Title: Beef with Pickled Walnuts
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 1/4 lb Stewing steak                       2    Bay leaves
    1/2 lb Ox kidney                           3 tb Beef dripping or olive oil
      4    Onions                          1 1/2 oz Flour
      1 lb Carrots                             1 pt (scant) light stock
      6    Pickled walnuts (or more)      
 
  Prepare the meats in the usual way, removing all traces of fat, gristle and
  membrane, and cut into large chunks.  Cut the onions into one-eighths.
  Scrub or scrape the carrots and cut them into 1/2 to 3/4 inch lengths. Toss
  with the meats, onions and carrots in the flour (which should be
  well-seasoned) and brown and seal, in batches, in sizzling hot frying pan
  barely filmed with dripping or well-flavoured oil.  Transfer to a
  flameproof casserole.  "Wash out" the frying pan with some of the stock and
  add it to the casserole.  Add the rest of the stock, 2 tablespoons juice
  from the jar of pickled walnuts and the bay leaves.  Season with salt and
  pepper and bring to simmering point. Cover and cook at 300 F (150 C) gas
  mark 2 for about 3 hours until the meats are very tender and the gravy is
  deliciously rich.
  
  Add the quartered or sliced walnuts to the beef.  Check the stew for
  seasoning and cook for about 15 minutes more before serving.

      Title: Roman Pie
 Categories: Meats, Pasta
      Yield: 8 servings
 
----------------------------FOR THE MEAT LAYERS----------------------------
      1 lb Cooked turkey or chicken *          1 lg Bunch parsley
    1/4 lb Cooked ham                               Lemon juice
    1/4 lb Cooked tongue                            A few black olives
     50 g  Canned anchovy fillets                   Canned consomme **
    3/4 lb Mushrooms                     

----------------------------FOR THE PASTA LAYERS----------------------------
      6 oz Macaroni                            1 oz Plain flour
 12 1/2 fl Milk                                4 oz Cheddar cheese
    1/2 pt Single cream                        1 oz Parmesan cheese
      1 oz Butter                         
 
  *Note: Weight given for turkey or chicken is skinned, boned weight. Goose,
  pheasant and other birds can be used instead.
  
  **Well-flavoured, clear stock and a little gelatine powder may be
  substituted for canned consomme.
  
  Make a smooth, rich sauce with the butter, flour, milk and cream.  Let it
  simmer for about 4 minutes.  Then, away from the heat, stir in the grated
  Cheddar and Parmesan, a seasoning of nutmeg and some salt and pepper - but
  go carefully with the salt in view of the cheeses and salted meats used in
  this dish.  Let the sauce cool while you cook the macaroni in plenty of
  salted water until al dente.  Plunge the pasta in cold water to arrest
  cooking, drain well and stir it into the sauce.
  
  Slice the mushrooms thickly and saute them well in a non-stick pan with no
  fat.  Season them with about 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, plenty of pepper
  and a little salt and allow to become cold.  Then cut the turkey meat into
  pieces about the width and half the length of your little finger, and mix
  the poultry and mushrooms together.
  
  Cut the ham, tongue and drained anchovies into strips about the same length
  as the poultry but considerably less wide.  Mix the anchovies, ham and
  tongue with a good quantity of fairly coarsely chopped parsley.
  
  Sprinkle about one third to half of the ham mixture over the base of a
  shallow dish of 4 to 4-1/2 pint capacity.  Cover with half the macaroni
  mixture, then all the turkey mixture, then the rest of the macaroni. Spread
  each layer evenly and press down into the dish with a potato masher before
  adding the next layer.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Arrange the remaining ham mixture on top and scatter the olives to make a
  decorative display of the pink, green and black ingredients.  Press down
  lightly then pour on enough barely melted consomme or cool jellied stock to
  cover.
  
  Cover the dish and refrigerate for a few hours until set.  Better still,
  refrigerate Roman pie overnight to allow flavours to blend and mature, but
  be sure to bring it back to room temperature at least two hours before
  serving.

      Title: Neat's Tongue (To Serve Hot or Cold)
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Pickled ox tongue (4-5 lbs.)             Bay leaves
      2    Onions                                   Parsley
      2    Carrots                                  Rosemary
      2    Celery stalks                      12    Black peppercorns

------------------------ALSO, IF SERVING TONGUE COLD------------------------
           A little Madeira                         Gelatine powder
 
  Rinse the tongue and then soak it in plenty of cold water for at least 12
  hours.  Change the water once or more during this time.  Next day choose a
  heavy-based saucepan or flameproof casserole that will hold the tongue
  snugly.  Put the tongue into it, cover with cold water, bring to the boil
  and skim.  Taste the water; if it is very salty, tip it away, add fresh
  water and bring to the boil again.  Add the chopped vegetables, peppercorns
  and a bouquet of bay, parsley and rosemary.  Cover tightly and cook very
  gently on top of the stove or in an oven heated to 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2
  for about 4 hours until the tongue is so tender that a skewer will go
  through the root end like butter.  Lower the temperature as necessary; the
  meat will be best if barely a bubble breaks the surface of the liquid as it
  cooks.  Skin the cooked tongue while it is still hot. Then cut away the fat
  and gristle from the end and remove all small bones if the butcher has not
  already done this.  Skim off all the fat from the cooking liquor and save
  it for the sauce and for soups.
  
  IF THE TONGUE IS TO BE SERVED HOT, carve it in thin slices while it is
  still hot and arrange it prettily, overlapping slices like tiles, on a
  large warmed serving dish.  Pour some good hot sauce over it, cover the
  dish with foil and place in the oven for about 10 minutes to heat through.
  The spiced Kumquat Sauce recipe is one of my favourites and I like to serve
  extra in a sauce boat.
  
  IF THE TONGUE IS TO BE SERVED COLD, mould and glaze it while still warm.
  Curl the tongue to make it fit a small round container with straight sides.
  Traditional tongue-presses usually measure about 5-6 inches in diameter; a
  cake tin or souffle dish of similar size will do just as well.
  
  To glaze, melt 2 teaspoons gelatine powder in 1 tablespoon water, then
  blend in a scant 1/2 pint tongue cooking liquor (seasoned and reduced as
  necessary for good flavour), and give it a little oomph with 1-2
  tablespoons Madeira.  Pour over the tongue as much of the liquid jelly as
  is needed to fill gaps.  Press the tongue down with a saucer or plate which
  fits just inside the tin, weight it down heavily and leave overnight in a
  cold larder until meat and jelly are set.  Chill any left-over jelly
  separately so that it can be diced and used to garnish the tongue when it
  is served.
  
  Unmould the tongue on to a flat dish for serving.  Decorate it and
  accompany it with a fine sauce such as a classic Cumberland sauce or
  Piquant Parsley and Caper Sauce.

      Title: Sauces for Tongue
 Categories: Sauces, Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
--------------------------FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE--------------------------
      5    Kumquats                            1 tb Tarragon vinegar
      3    Bay leaves                        3/4 oz Butter
      9    Whole cloves; bruised               2 tb Flour
    3/4 pt Stock, pref. from tongue                 Salt and pepper
      1 lg Orange (juice only)                 4 tb Thick cream
      2 ts Lemon juice                   

-------------------------FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE-------------------------
      1    Garlic clove                        1 sm Lemon; juice & zest only
      1 oz Parsely; chopped                    8 fl Oil
    1/2 oz Chives                                   Black pepper
  1 1/2 oz Capers                         
 
  FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE: Slice and remove the pips from the kumquats. Put
  them into a pan with the bay leaves, cloves, stock, orange juice, lemon
  juice and tarragon vinegar. Bring very slowly to the boil. Add a little
  salt and pepper, cover and set aside for 20 minutes to infuse. Strain,
  reserving the kumquats, liquid and spices separately. Make a smooth sauce
  with the butter, flour and cooking liquid. Return spices to the pan and
  simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. Stir regularly to prevent sticking and to
  stop a skin from forming. By the end of this time, the sauce should be the
  consistency of cream; if necessary boil it hard for 2-3 minutes to reduce
  and thicken it a little. Strain to extract the spices, stir in the cream,
  then the kumquats. Reheat gently, adding a few pinches of ground cloves,
  more lemon juice and other seasonings to taste.
  
  FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE:  Crush the garlic clove with a little salt. Then
  process it briefly with the chopped parsley, chives and capers.  Add the
  lemon juice and zest, and the oil and whizz again until the mixture is
  reduced to a thickened fragrant green puree.  Add a coarse grinding of
  black pepper and leave it for 1 hour or so to allow the flavours to blend.

      Title: Home-Candied Angelica
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Angelica                            1 lb Granulated sugar
 
  The most important thing about candying angelica is to choose stalks that
  are young and tender.  In other words, angelica is only worth candying in
  April or May when the shoots are new and softly coloured.  Trim the young
  shoots into 3-4 inch lengths, put them into a pan, cover with water and
  bring to a boil.  Drain and scrape away tough skin and fibrous threads with
  a potato peeler, rather as you might prepare celery.  Return the angelica
  to the pan, pour on fresh boiling water and cook until green and tender. If
  the shoots are as youthful as they should be, this will take 5 minutes or
  less.  Drain the stalks and dry them.  Put them into a bowl and sprinkle
  granulated sugar between layers, allowing 1 pound of sugar for every 1
  pound of angelica.  Cover and leave for 2 to 3 days.  Slide contents of the
  bowl into a heavy-based pan.  Bring very slowly to the boil and simmer
  until the angelica feels perfectly tender and looks clear. Drain, then roll
  or toss the shoots on greaseproof paper thickly strewn with sugar, letting
  the angelica take up as much sugar as will stick to it. Then dry off the
  angelica - without letting it become hard - in the oven, using the lowest
  possible temperature.  I place the stalks directly on the oven shelves
  (with trays underneath to catch any falling sugar) and find they need about
  3 hours.  Wrap and store after cooling completely. Packed into pretty
  little boxes, home-candied angelica makes a charming present.

      Title: Angelica Tartlets
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 oz Home-candied angelica             1/2 c  Curd cheese
      1    Shortcrust pastry *                 1    Egg yolk; mixed with:
  1 1/2 oz Butter                              1 ts Milk
  1 1/2 tb Honey                               1    Egg white
 
  *Note: Shortcrust pastry made with 7-8 oz flour will be about right for
  this recipe.
  
  These tarts are irresistible when made with home-candied angelica, as dull
  as ditchwater when store-bought is used.  Chop the angelica into small
  pieces, cover with warm water to rinse off some of the sugar and set aside
  for a few minutes.  While the angelica soaks, line 18 x 2 1/2 inch tartlet
  tins with the shortcrust pastry and start preparing the filling.  Dice and
  barely melt the butter in a small saucepan.  Away from the heat, beat in
  the honey, then the curd cheese, then the egg yolk mixed with the milk.
  Stir in the well drained angelica.  Whisk the egg white to snowy peaks and
  fold it in.  Spoon the mixture into the pastry-lined tartlet tins and bake
  at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for 30 minutes until puffed up and golden.
  Serve as soon as cooled from cooking.

      Title: Bara Brith (Speckled Bread)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      6 oz Dried fruit                        10 oz Self-raising flour
      8 oz Dark brown sugar                    1    Egg
    1/2 pt Strong hot tea                 
 
  This is Wales' traditional rich fruit bread.  South Wales makes it with
  baking powder; Northerners prefer yeast as the raising agent.  Either way
  it's delicious.
  
  Soak the dried fruit and sugar overnight in the tea.  You can use either
  fresh tea, or the cold dregs from the teapot (this gives a good strong
  colour).  Next day, sieve the flour and fold it it into the fruit.  Mix in
  the lightly beaten egg.  Line a small loaf-tin with buttered paper then tip
  in the mixture, smoothing it well into the corners.
  
  Bake in a gentle oven at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for 1 1/2 hours.  Cool
  and store for at least 2 days in a tin so that it matures moist and rich.
  Traditionalists say you should never butter the Bara Brith, but Dorothy
  says do, as it's lovely that way.

      Title: Tea and Lemon Ice
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 pt Strong fragrant tea *             1/2 pt Water
      2    Lemons                              1    Egg white
      8 oz Sugar                               6 tb Carbonated water
 
  *Note: Suggested teas are Lapsang Souchong or Earl Grey.
  
  In a Welsh household the kettle sits permanently on the hob ready to refill
  the teapot.  This delicious ice makes a refreshing change in summer. Or
  serve as a dessert with Welsh cakes or with a plate of buttered Bara Brith.
  Makes approximately 2 pints.
  
  Strain the tea and leave to cool.  Peel the lemons, avoiding the bitter
  pith, and squeeze the juice.  Bring the sugar and water to boil with the
  lemon rind, stirring to dissolve all the sugar.  Leave it to cool.  Beat
  the egg white lightly with the carbonated water.  Mix all the ingredients
  thoroughly with a whisk.
  
  Freeze the mixture - an ice-cream-maker is best.  If you use the ice-making
  compartment of the fridge, take it out when frozen, beat it until it has
  doubled in volume, and re-freeze it.  Don't serve the ice rock-hard -
  transfer it to the fridge half an hour before serving.

      Title: Laverbread and Crab Souffles with Cockle Sauce
 Categories: Fish/sea, Sauces
      Yield: 8 servings
 
--------------------------------THE SOUFFLES--------------------------------
      1    Boiled crab; -OR-                   2 oz Flour
      6 oz -Prepared Crabmeat                3/4 pt Milk
      6 oz Prepared laverbread                 3    Eggs
           -OR- nori or spinach              1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
      2 oz Butter                                   Salt & pepper

--------------------------------COCKLE SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/4 pt White sauce from souffle mix        4 oz Cockles or clams (shelled)
    1/4 pt Whipping cream                      2 oz Prepared laverbread **
 
  If the crab is whole, pull the body apart and pick out all the meat -
  discarding only the mouthpiece and the grey "dead man's fingers" that
  fringe the inside carapace.  For extra flavour, make a stock with crab
  shell, flavoured with a piece of carrot and a quarter of onion, and boil
  down to a couple of well-flavoured tablespoons which can replace the
  equivalent milk in the basic white sauce given above.
  
  Prepare the white sauce; melt the butter in a small pan.  Stir in the flour
  and fry gently until the mixture is still pale but sandy.  Whisk in the
  milk slowly, beating till you have a thick sauce.  Simmer for 5 minutes.
  Preheat the oven to 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.  Stir the crabmeat and
  prepared laverbread into the sauce.  Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
  Separate the eggs.  Beat the whites until quite stiff.  By now the sauce
  will be cool enough to stir in the yolks.  Fold in the whites, turning well
  to "tire" the mixture.  Taste and adjust the seasoning. Butter eight small
  souffle dishes and spoon in the mixture, leaving a finger's worth for
  expansion.  Bake for 10-12 minutes until puffed up and golden.
  
  Meanwhile make the cockle sauce.  Heat up the reserved white sauce with the
  cream.  Stir in the cockles and laverbread.  Season with the salt and
  freshly milled pepper.  Serve with the souffles as soon as they are ready.

      Title: Rich Venison & Mushroom Stew
 Categories: Meats, Soups/stews
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Good stewing venison              3/4 pt (scant) beef or game stock
           -- (trimmed weight)                      Butter
      1    Onion                                    Oil
    3/4 lb Small flat mushrooms                     Flour
  2 1/2 fl Red wine vinegar                         Sugar
  2 1/2 fl Water                                    Bay leaves

--------------------------FOR THE FORCEMEAT BALLS--------------------------
      8 oz Fresh breadcrumbs               1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
      8 oz Grated suet                         1 lg Egg
      2    Lemons (grated zest only)           3 tb Fresh chopped parsley
 
  Cut the venison into large chunks and marinate for about 24 hours in the
  water and vinegar with 2 bay leaves and plenty of pepper.
  
  Make the forcemeat mixture, seasoning it well and binding it with the
  lightly beaten egg.  Shape into 24 small balls, fry briskly until golden-
  brown and crisp and reserve.  Then fry the mushrooms hard in a very little
  hot fat.  Remove and reserve separately.
  
  Drain and dry the meat well, reserving the marinade.  Dust the venison with
  well-seasoned flour and brown and seal in batches.  Transfer it to a 4 pint
  flameproof casserole; ideally this should be no more than 8 inches in
  diameter across the top.  Chop the onion finely and fry gently. Sprinkle on
  2 tablespoons flour, pour on the marinade liquid and the stock over the
  meat and season with salt, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 2 bay leaves.
  
  Bring to a bare simmer, cover tightly and cook over the lowest possible
  flame (or in a low oven if you prefer) until the meat is deliciously tender
  and the gravy is dark and rich.  Shoulder meat may need as little as 1 1/2
  hours, lesser cuts of meat will need considerably more.  Stir occasionally
  to prevent sticking.  When ready, remove the bay and check seasoning. Cool
  and refrigerate overnight if not to be served on the same day.
  
  To finish the dish, bring everything back to room temperature.  Add the
  prepared mushrooms to the stew, pushing them well down into the gravy, then
  cover the surface with the forcemeat balls and bake - without a lid to keep
  the forcemeat balls really crisp - at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for about 25
  minutes.

      Title: Highland Sausage Roll
 Categories: Meats, Appetizers, Sausages
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     10 oz Venison (trimmed weight)            3 tb Port
      6 oz Belly of pork (trimmed wt.)              Allspice, thyme or Worcester
      2 oz Pitted prunes                       1 lb Ready-made puff pastry
      1 sm Onion                               1    Beaten egg to glaze
           Remains of a pot of tea        
 
  Mince the meats fairly finely, chop the onion very finely and mix together.
  Season with a good grinding of pepper - but no salt - and some allspice,
  thyme or a few shakes of Worcester sauce.  Pour on the port and mix well,
  then cover and leave for several hours or overnight to allow the flavours
  to blend.  Cover the prunes with cold tea and leave to soak for several
  hours.
  
  Season the sausagemeat with salt and roll it into a long, fat sausage
  shape.  Roll the pastry out to a rectangle and lay the "sausage" down the
  length of it.  Lay the whole drained prunes on top of the meat.  Damp one
  long edge with beaten egg, roll up carefully and seal.  Alternatively you
  may like to enclose the sausage in a decorative pastry plait.  In this
  case, roll the pastry out to a square, lay the "sausage" down the centre
  and place the whole drained prunes on top.  Cut the pastry diagonally into
  1/2-inch strips on either side of the meat.  Damp the end of each pastry
  strip with beaten egg then fold the strips alternately from each side, over
  the meat to create a plait effect.  Seal the pastry ends.
  
  Slide the pastry parcel on to a damp baking sheet and glaze the top.  If
  you have made a sausage roll, decorate it with pastry leaves and make one
  or two steam slits in the top of the pastry.  Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas
  mark 4 for a further 25 minutes or so.

      Title: Glazed Venison Pate
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Venison (trimmed weight)                 Whole and ground bay leaves
    1/2 lb Belly of pork (trimmed wt.)         1 tb Red wine vinegar
    1/2 lb Chicken livers                      1 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Orange                            1/4 pt Red wine
      1    Lemon                               1 ts Gelatine powder
      2    Garlic cloves                            A few kumquats to decorate
  1 1/2 ts Fresh thyme (more to taste)    
 
  Mince all three meats fairly finely and put them into a bowl.  Add the zest
  of the orange and lemon, the crushed garlic, the thyme, olive oil, vinegar,
  a generous pinch of powdered bay and plenty of black pepper.  Mix
  thoroughly and stir in the wine.  Cover and leave to marinate overnight.
  
  Season with salt - I find 1 teaspoon about right but fry a small nugget of
  the mixture to check.  Turn the pate into a terrine of about 2 1/4 pint
  capacity.  Pack the mixture well down into the corners of the dish and use
  a spoon to hollow out slightly the centre top.  Cover with greaseproof
  paper and foil, stand the dish in a roasting pan containing enough hot
  water to come halfway up the sides of the dish.  Bake at 325 F (160 C) gas
  mark 3 for 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours.
  
  Using a bulb baster, remove and reserve most of the juices that surround
  the pate.  Replace the greaseproof paper and foil, press the pate lightly
  with 1-1/2 to 2 lb weights and cool for 1-1/2 hours.  Then drain off any
  remaining juices that have not been re-absorbed by the pate.  Mix all the
  venison juices that you have collected with the juice of the orange and
  measure.  Add a splash of water if necessary to make 1/2 pint in total.
  Dissolve the gelatine powder in the mixture and use it to glaze the pate,
  adding a few bay leaves and kumquats to decorate if liked.

      Title: Snippets of Venison
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 3 servings
 
    3/4 lb Best venison trimmings                   Garlic
      2 fl Cider                                    Juniper
      4 fl Good stock                               Unsalted butter
      6 oz Cap mushrooms                       4 fl Soured cream or Greek yogurt
      1 bn Chives                         
 
  Cut the meat into strips about the size of your thumb - if possible.  Some
  of the trimmings may, of course, be slightly ragged, triangular or cubed
  but this is the size and shape to aim for.  Dust with coarsely ground black
  pepper and 3 to 4 crushed juniper berries, moisten with the cider, cover
  and leave to marinate for 24 hours.  Crush a garlic clove, mix it with the
  soured cream or yoghurt and leave it to infuse in a cool place for 24
  hours.
  
  Carefully drain and dry the venison, reserving the marinade.  Slice the
  mushrooms thickly and saute them in a little very hot butter.  Remove and
  keep hot.  Then saute the venison briefly, searing it nicely but keeping it
  succulent and pink within - 2 minutes is plenty.  Then let the venison rest
  in a low oven where it will go on cooking a little without toughening.
  Start making the sauce straight away or wait for several minutes if you
  want the meat to lose its pinkness.
  
  To make the sauce, let the marinade liquid and the stock bubble away in the
  frying pan until reduced to just 2 or 3 spoonfuls.  Blend in any juices
  that the venison has exuded and bubble again briefly.  Then beat in the
  garlic-flavoured soured cream, away from the heat.  Return the pan to a low
  flame to warm the sauce.  Season well, scatter with chopped chives and
  serve on very hot plates.

      2    Shallots; chopped                   1    Sprig of thyme
           Butter                              1    Curl of orange peel
     12 oz Whole green lentils (Le Puy)             Light stock or water
           Handful of chopped lovage      
 
  Soften the chopped shallots in a little butter without colouring them. Stir
  in the lentils.  Add a handful of chopped lovage, the sprig of thyme,
  orange peel and stock or unsalted water to cover well.  Simmer until
  tender.  Drain off and reduce the cooking liquor to make a little sauce,
  enriching it with more butter and seasoning to taste.  In the absence of
  lovage, use the young leaves and tenderest parts of a celery heart, and
  season the dish with a pinch each of celery salt, lemon zest and powdered
  curry spices.

  vegetables are tender but not disintegrated and most of the liquid has been
  absorbed.  Drizzle on some hot cream and let it slither down between
  layers.  Warm through briefly and serve sprinkled with parsley.

           - about 2 lbs., trimmed wt.         1 tb Mustard seed
      2 oz Salt                                2    Short pieces cinnamon bark
      1 pt Water                             1/2 ts Cloves
      8 oz Onions                            1/2 ts Allspice
      1 lb Sugar                               3    Little dried red peppers
 
  Trim the cauliflower and divide it into florets.  Blanch the florets in
  boiling salted water for 5 minutes.  Drain them and run cold water through
  them immediately.  Slice the onions and layer them with cauliflower into
  sterilized jars.  Heat the vinegar with the sugar and spices, and pour the
  boiling mixture into the jars.  The florets should be submerged.  Cover and
  seal while hot.  Ready to eat in a week, the pickle will keep in a cool
  place all year.  Makes approximately 3 lb. pickle.
  
  Suggestions: Make an oeuf en cocette, very lightly cooked with a teaspoon
  of cream and serve it on a plate along with pickled cauliflower, sticks of
  cucumber, spring onions, and matchsticks of celery to dip into it.
  
  Toss a few cauliflower florets with a haricot bean salad dressed with olive
  oil, some of the pickling liquor, chopped garlic and parsley.
  
  Serve them as part of an antipasto with olives and slices of salad.

      Title: Pad Thai -- General Notes
 Categories: Information, Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Information:                   
 
  Rice Noodles: ============= You can use fresh or dried, in widths from 1/8
  to 1/2 inch wide.  I've never tried fresh. The dried ones have to be soaked
  in water to soften them. The recipes call for soaking in cold water,
  lukewarm water, hot water, and boiling water for anywhere from 7 minutes to
  2 hours.  I put mine into warm tap water and let them soak while I'm
  preparing everything else. Just before I start cooking, I dump them into a
  colander to drain.  One recipe suggests cellophane noodles as an
  alternative to rice noodles -- I've never tried that variation.
  
  Meat or No Meat: ================ The most common meat called for is
  shrimp, with chicken and/or pork use in addition to or in place of the
  shrimp.  Some recipes add bean curd; some substitute it for the meat. Jeff
  Smith's recipe uses deep fried bean curd. My own variation is to substitute
  various veggies (asparagus, red bell pepper, broccoli, snow peas, or
  whatever else looks good.) As Nancie McDermott says, "Thai cooks blithely
  tinker with the classic formula to create signature variations, and you
  can, too."
  
  Oil and Seasonings: =================== Cooking pad thai starts with
  vegetable or peanut oil.  Most versions add garlic, and sometimes shallots,
  shrimp paste (be prepared for the smell!), onions, fresh red chilies,
  and/or preserved sweet white radish.
  
  The Sauce: ========== What makes pad thai, in addition to the rice noodles,
  is the sauce.  The general mix of flavors is sweet, salty, sour, and hot.
  Typical ingredients are:
  
  ~~ fish sauce (sometimes soy sauce is used in addition, or in place of for
  pure vegetarian versions) ~~ sugar (sometimes palm sugar is suggested) ~~
  vinegar (various kinds specified; tamarind sauce or lime juice are
  sometimes used instead) ~~ "red stuff" -- may be paprika, tomato paste,
  catsup, chili powder, hot chili sauce, chili paste with garlic, tomato
  sauce, or cayenne pepper, depending on the recipe. ~~ Other possible
  additions: salt, black pepper, chicken stock, dried shrimp powder. One
  recipe calls for boiling the sauce before using.
  
  Eggs: ===== Anywhere from 0-6. Some recipes call for beating the eggs
  before adding; others suggested breaking the yolk after adding the egg to
  the pan. Various techniques are suggested for manipulating the egg while
  cooking.  One recipe calls for cooking the egg before starting the pad
  thai, cutting it into strips, and then adding the egg strips back at the
  end of cooking.  I haven't tried this myself but have had it in
  restaurants.
  
  Bean Sprouts and Scallions: ========================== These are usually
  added last in cooking, or added to the finished dish without cooking.
  
  Garnishes: ========= Various things can be added to finished dish as an
  edible garnish:
  
  ~~ lime or lemon wedges ~~ ground roasted chilies ~~ ground roasted peanuts
  ~~ dried red chili flakes ~~ fresh coriander leaves ~~ cucumber slices ~~
  dried shrimps ~~ fried basil leaves ~~ cherry tomatoes ~~ mint sprigs
  
  Experiment, and enjoy!

  NOTE: (yellow bean sauce from Thailand is saltier than sauce from Hong Kong
  or China, so season to taste)
  
  Slice unpeeled eggplant crosswise into slices 1/8-inch thick.  Cut tofu
  into 1/2-inch cubes.  Heat oil in skillet; add garlic and stir-fry until
  light brown (don't burn!).  Add eggplant and tofu and cook for 5 to 7
  minutes.  Add remaining ingredients; mix gently.  Serve immediately, since
  eggplant and basil turn dark if dish sits after cooking.  Makes 3 to 4
  servings.

      Title: Evil Jungle Prince with Chicken (Or With Mixed Vegetables)
 Categories: Thai, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Boneless chicken breast           1/2 c  Coconut milk
           -OR-                              1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 lb -Mixed vegetables,                  1    -to
           - (see note below)                  4 tb Fish sauce,
      2    -to                                      - based on personal taste
      6 sm Red chile peppers                        - (omit for veggie version)
    1/2    Stalk fresh lemon grass            10    -to
      2    Kaffir lime leaves                 15    Basil leaves
      2 tb Oil                                 1 c  Chopped cabbage
 
  Thinly cut chicken into 2-inch strips.  (If doing veggie version, cut
  vegetables into thin strips.) Grind together red chili peppers, lemon
  grass, and kaffir lime leaves in a food processor or pound in a mortar.
  Heat oil to medium-high and saute pepper mixture for 3 minutes.  Stir in
  coconut milk and cook for 2 minutes.  Add chicken (or vegetables) and cook
  for 5 minutes or until cooked (same time for veggies).  Reduce heat to
  medium-low.  Stir in fish sauce (if using), salt, and basil.  Serve on a
  bed of chopped cabbage.
  
  Note: ===== For mixed vegetables, choose from among bell peppers, string
  beans, water chestnuts, tomatoes (small cherry tomatoes are best), bamboo
  shoots, miniature corn, asparagus, cucumbers, zucchini, Japanese eggplant,
  and mushrooms.  I particularly like string beans or asparagus, a few cherry
  tomatoes, shredded (rather than sliced) bamboo shoots, miniature corn, and
  some straw mushrooms or slender (Japanese) eggplant.

      Title: Galloping Horses (Thai Appetizer)
 Categories: Thai, Appetizers
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 ts Oil                                 1    Fresh pineapple; -OR-
      1 lb Ground pork                         5    -Tangerines, -OR-
      4    -to                                 4    -Oranges
      8    Garlic cloves                     1/3 c  Sugar
           -- finely chopped                 1/2 ts Pepper
      3    Green onions, white part                 Lettuce leaves
           -- chopped                               Mint or coriander leaves
    3/4 c  Roasted salted peanuts                   Chopped chilis
 
  Grind peanuts.  Heat oil in a frying pan, add pork, garlic and onions. Cook
  until pink color disappears.  Drain off most of the fat.  Add sugar and
  pepper, cook 1-2 minutes.  Add peanuts, mix in well, then remove from heat.
  Cool to room temperature.
  
  Prepare platter, lining with lettuce leaves.  Peel and segment the citrus
  fruit if used, cutting each segment down to the back and fanning open to
  form a circle.  If using pineapple, cut off top leaves and outer skin, as
  thinly as possible, from top down.  Look at the "eye" pattern, as it forms
  a spiral down the pineapple.  Cut the spirals with a sharp knife held at
  about a 45 degree angle.  Cut off bottom.  Cut pineapple into about 5 or 6
  wedges and then cut each of those into 1/4 inch slices. Arrange fruit on
  platter.
  
  Mound meat mixture onto fruit, and decorate with other garnishes.  Serve at
  room temperature, or chilled.

      Title: Green Bean Curry (Aka Country Curry or Jungle Curry)
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh green beans                        Bamboo shoots (optional)
      2 tb Thai Curry Paste                    6 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Vegetable oil                  
 
  Clean and pick green bean tips.  In a dutch oven (or equivalent size
  vessel), heat oil.  Add curry paste and "fry" until fragrant, about 1
  minute.  Add broth, green beans, bamboo shoots (or other vegetable). Bring
  to a rapid boil and cook like that for about 15-20 minutes (watching that
  liquid doesn't reduce too much; add water as necessary). Reduce heat to a
  hard simmer and continue cooking until green beans are VERY done and have
  absorbed the flavor of the curry broth.  Serve in bowls over rice.
  
  NOTES: If necessary, you may substitute whole frozen green beans for fresh.
  
  Thai Curry Paste: "Country Curry" or "Red Curry"; but they are all
  flavorful. Mae Ploy and Tommy Tang are other good brands.
  
  Bamboo shoots: I like to use a large can of bamboo tips because they are
  tender and I can cut them into 1/4 inch thick round slices. You can also
  use a couple of the small cans of sliced bamboo shoots, but they will not
  absorb the flavor as well.  I think carrots cut into coins would also be
  good, if you like those. I tried potatoes once, but they just
  disintegrated.)

      1 tb Fish sauce or salt to taste    
 
  NOTE: The following mixture may be substituted for 1 teaspoon Thai chili
  paste: 1/4 ts cayenne, 1/4 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp oil
  
  Wash, peel, de-vein shrimp.  Save shells.  Wash shrimp again, drain, pat
  dry, cover and refrigerate.  If using fresh lemongrass, cut each stick into
  three 2 inch pieces--starting from rounded bottom end.  Discard straw-like
  top.  Lightly crush the 6 pieces.
  
  In a pan, combine lemongrass, lime leaves, stock, and shrimp shells. Bring
  to boil.  Lower heat and simmer gently for 20 minutes.  Strain stock, then
  add fish sauce, lime juice, and chili paste.  Adjust fish sauce and lime
  juice to taste.  *Add more chili paste for more heat.
  
  Drain straw mushrooms and add to stock.  (If using fresh mushrooms, quarter
  them and drop in lightly salted boiling water.  Boil 1 minute. Drain and
  add to stock.) **The soup can be prepared to this point several hours ahead
  of time and stored in the refrigerator.**
  
  Prepare garnish shortly before serving.  Cut green chilies into fine
  rounds.  Wash and dry cilantro.  Just before serving, heat the soup, when
  it begins to boil, drop in peeled shrimp.  Cook on medium heat for 2
  minutes or just until shrimp turn opaque.  Garnish with chilies and
  cilantro leaves.  Serve hot.

           -- pounded to a powder              2 c  Fresh bean sprouts
      9 oz Flat rice sticks, 1/8" wide              - beans removed
           Vegetable oil                     1/4 c  Roasted, unsalted peanuts
    1/3 c  Fresh sweet basil leaves                 - coarsely ground
           - (Thai or purple basil)                 Cherry tomatoes; halved
      2    Red Serrano chili peppers                Lime wedges
           -seeded & very finely minced             Mint sprigs
      4    Garlic cloves; minced                    -OR- sliced green onions
  1 1/2 lg Boned chicken breast halves    
 
  Combine the vinegar, water, fish sauce, tomato paste, sugar, and dried
  shrimp in a small bowl; mix until well blended and reserve.  In a large
  pot, soak the noodles in enough water to cover.  In a small skillet or pot,
  heat vegetable oil 3/4 to 1 inch deep to 350 degrees, or until a dried rice
  noodle puffs instantly when dropped into the oil.  Deep-fry the basil
  leaves a few at a time, turning them once or twice until they are crisp, or
  40 seconds to a minute; drain on paper toweling.
  
  Bring the noodles to a boil and cook them 2 minutes, or until they are
  almost tender.  Drain and rinse them well, then spread them on paper
  toweling to dry slightly.  Head a wok or large skillet and add about 2 1/2
  tablespoons vegetable oil.  Fry the Serrano peppers about 30 seconds, then
  add the garlic and stir-fry until it is soft.  Add the chicken or pork and
  stir-fry until the chicken is almost opaque throughout or the pork is
  browned.  Stir in the shrimp and the sauce and mix completely. Make a well
  in the center of the mixture and pour in the eggs. When they are almost
  set, scramble them evenly.  Add half the noodles, throughly incorporating
  them into the mixture; stir in the remaining noodles and half the bean
  sprouts.  Cook just until the bean sprouts are nearly wilted.
  
  Heap the meat and noodles onto a platter.  Cover one half of them with
  ground peanuts and the other half with uncooked bean sprouts.  Ring the
  noodles with lime wedges, cherry tomatoes, and mint sprigs and garnish the
  top with the fried basil.

      Title: Nue Gra Pao: Stir-Fried Beef with Mint
 Categories: Thai, Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Flank steak                         3 tb Fish sauce
     14    Serrano chilies                     1 tb Granulated sugar
           - finely chopped                  1/2 c  Water (more if needed)
    1/4 c  Finely chopped garlic             1/2 c  Mint or basil leaves
    1/2 c  Finely chopped yellow onion              - (loosely packed)
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil; PLUS:                     Green lettuce leaves
      2 tb Vegetable oil                  
 
  This is a rich, hearty dish with plenty of typical Thai flavors.  Any kind
  of beef may be used, but flank steak works particularly well because it is
  easy to cut it across the grain, which helps keep the meat from falling
  apart during stir-frying and produces a tender result.  Be sure to serve
  plenty of rice, because it helps moderate the hot chilies without
  detracting from the flavor.  You may reduce the number of chilies by up to
  one half, but traditionally this dish should have a rich, hot chili flavor.
  
  =======================================================================
  
  1.  Slice the beef across the grain into strips 1/4 inch thick and 2 to 3
  inches long.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Pound or grind the chilies, garlic, and onion to a coarse paste in a
  mortar or blender.  If you use a blender you may need to add the oil to aid
  in grinding.
  
  3.  Heat a wok, add the oil, and swirl it over the surface of the pan. (Do
  not add more oil if you have ground the chilies, onion, and garlic in oil.)
  Add the paste from Step 2 and stir-fry until it is light golden.
  
  4.  Add the beef and stir-fry until it is a uniform tan color, but do not
  overcook it.
  
  5.  Add the fish sauce, sugar, water, and mint (or basil) leaves.  More
  water may be added if the sauce is too dry.  There should be about 1/2 to
  3/4 cup sauce, depending on how much water you added.
  
  Ahead of time note: The dish may be prepared a day in advance to this
  point.  To do so, proceed through Step 5, omitting the mint or basil
  leaves.  When you are ready to serve, heat the mixture and add the leaves.
  If the meat has absorbed the liquid, add just enough warm water to bring it
  back to the original consistency.
  
  6.  Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves in a serving bowl and put the
  beef mixture over them.  Serve the beef immediately or keep it warm while
  preparing other dishes.
  
  7.  Serve with rice.

 Categories: Thai, Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Serrano chilies                     2 tb Fish sauce
    1/4 c  White vinegar                       1 ts Ground roasted chilies *
  1 1/2 lb Flank steak                         2 tb Ground toasted rice **
    1/4 lb Red onion; sliced                        Red lettuce leaves
      4    Green onions                             Coriander sprigs
    1/4 c  Lime juice; PLUS:                        Mint or Basil leaves
      1 tb Lime juice                     
 
  1.  Remove the stems, but not the seedes, from the chilies.  Slice the
  chiles crosswise into pieces 1/8" thick.  Place the sliced chiles and
  vinegar in a small serving bowl.  Let it stand for at least 15 minutes.
  
  2.  Grill the beef to the desired doneness, preferably over charcoal. Slice
  it across the grain into strips 1/8" thick and 1 to 2 inches long. Put
  these in a large ceramic bowl.
  
  3.  Peel the red onion, remove the root portion, and slice the onion
  vertically into thin strips.  Slice the green onion diagonally into thin
  pieces.  Add both types of onion to the beef.
  
  4.  Add the lime juice, fish sauce, ground chilies, and ground rice. Mix
  well
  
  5.  Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves on a serving platter, and
  place th beef mixture on top.  Garnish with sprigs of coriander and mint or
  basil leaves.
  
  6.  Serve at room temperature, the vinegar sauce (from Step 1) and rice.
  
  *  Use small hot chilies about 3 to 4 inches long.  Roast whole chillie
  stems and all, in a dry wok or skillet until the color changes to dark red
  or brown depending on the chilies used.  Be careful not to let them burn.
  When the chilies have cooled, remove the stems and seeds.  Place the
  chilies in a food processor or blender and grind using short pulses.
  Pre-ground chilies are also commercially available, but often lack the
  "bite" of home ground ones and may be more expensive.
  
  ** Place uncooked rice in a dry wok or skillet and heat over moderate heat
  until deep golden brown,s tirring frequently to keep from burning and to
  allow it to develop a uniform color.  Watch the rice carefully after it
  begins to change colorand stir constantly because it can burn easily at
  this stage.  When it is auniform deep golden color, remove from heat and
  allow to cool to room temperature.  Grind it to a fine powder in a blender
  or a spice grinder.  This can be made in advance and kept in quantity so
  that there is always a supply on hand, but it is also easy to make up while
  preparing the dish.

      Title: Pad Thai
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried rice noodles 1/8" wide      1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           -Warm Water                              - (more if needed)
    1/2 lb Shrimp, chicken or pork             1 ts Chopped garlic
           -OR- a combination                  2    Eggs
    1/4 c  Fish sauce                        3/4 lb Bean sprouts
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar; plus:                  Ground roasted chiles
      2 tb Granulated sugar                         - (see note at end)
    1/4 c  White vinegar; plus:                     Unsalted roasted peanuts
      2 tb White vinegar                            - ground
      1 ts Paprika                                  Lime wedges
      4    Green onions                   
 
  1.  Soak noodles for 20-25 minutes in enough warm water to cover them. They
  should be flexible and soft, but not so soft that they can be mashed easily
  with the fingers.  Later cooking in liquid will soften them more. Drain
  them throughly in a colander while preparing the other ingredients.
  Traditionally they are left in full-length strands, but you may cut them
  into 8 inch lengths if you find it easier to stir-fry then that way.
  
  2.  Peel and devein the shrimp leaving the tails intact(or remove if
  preferred) Slice chicken, pork into 1/8 inch strips 1-2 inches long.
  
  3.  Mix the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, and paprika in a bowl and stir
  until the sugar dissolves.  Set aside.  Slice green onions both the green
  and white parts, diagonally into 1-1/2 inch long pieces.  Set aside.
  
  4.  Heat a wok, add the oil and swirl over the surface.  Add the garlic and
  stir fry until light golden.  Add the meat and stir-fry until shrimp is
  pink.  If using chicken or pork stir-fry until pink disappears.  Add the
  noodles and toss lightly to coat with oil and the distribute meat and
  garlic( I often do this in a larger pot since things tend to come out of
  the wok).
  
  5.  Add the liquid from step 3 and bring it to a boil rapidly, gently
  folding the noodles without breaking them.  Reduce heat to medium and boil
  the mixture, folding frequently until the noodles have absorbed the liquid
  (I find a pasta server works great for this step).
  
  6.  Lift the noodles gently from one side of the wok.  Pour a little oil
  along the side of the wok, then break the egg ad slip it into the oil.
  Break the yolk and cover the egg with the noodles immediately.  Repeat this
  on the opposite side with the other egg.  Allow eggs to cook undisturbed,
  over moderate heat until they are set and almost dry. Additional oil may by
  added if the eggs or the noodles begin to stick to the wok.
  
  7.  When the eggs are set and almost dry, fold them gently but rapidly into
  the noodles.  Try not to break the noodles, which will be soft and fragile
  at this point.  An effective way is to insert the scoop under the eggs,
  lift it through, and fold the mixtureover.  Continue the lifting and
  folding motion until the eggs are broken up and well distributed.
  
  8.  Add the green onions (and bean sprouts if you prefer them mixed in) and
  toss the entire mixture quickly and gently, stll avoiding breaking the
  noodles.  Cook for about 2 minutes or until onions are tender.
  
  9.  Take a large platter spread with bean sprouts(if you left them out
  above).  Spread Pud Thai from wok over top.  Sprinkle ground chilies(see
  note) and ground peanuts over the top and squeeze lime over the top.  Or
  serve toppings seperatly for each diner to add according to taste.
  
  Note on chilies: Buy whole dried chiles and grind since pre-ground often
  lack the "bite" of whole ones.  Thai chilies may be used (_VERY_ hot), or
  milder American chiles may be used.  The Thai chilies are know as Prig
  hang.  They may also be found in Mexican food sections under the name
  "Chiles Arbol".  Use sparing if you aren't used to them they are quite
  potent.

  chow or stir for a few more minutes until the noodles are hot and tender.
  
  Place on a serving platter with the garnishes, which are an integral part
  of the dish.

  Ingredient Notes: ================= Re: Chantaboon rice sticks: <I think
  the spelling of "chantaboon" can also be found as "jantaboon" or something
  like that.>
  
  Re: Pork, Beef, or Chicken, or Shrimp: <I used tofu when I made this. If
  you do the the same, press the tofu between three sheets of towel paper on
  the top and the bottom. Put a plate on top and a two pound weight on top of
  the plate. Wait 20 minutes>
  
  Re: Sliced salted radish: <These are packaged in a plastic see through flat
  container and slightly orange in color>

      Title: Pad Thai Pseudo-Vegetarian Style
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/4 c  Thai fish sauce                     3 tb Oil
    1/4 c  White vinegar; plus:                2    Garlic cloves (or more)
      2 tb White vinegar                       2    Eggs
      4 tb Sugar (less if desired)           3/4 lb Bean sprouts
      1 ts Paprika                             3    Green onions
      8 oz Thai rice noodles                        - sliced on the diagonal,
           -- (about 1/4" thick)                    - including white part
      8 oz Tofu                              3/4 c  Ground peanuts
      2 tb Dried shrimp (optional)             1 tb Roasted red chili peppers *
 
  * [Take some dried red chili peppers and cook them in an ungreased wok over
  low stirring constantly until they start to brown. Grind in a coffee
  grinder or spice mill.]
  
  Instructions: ============= Combine first four ingredients and let sit
  until sugar dissolves.  Soak rice noodles/sticks in warm water until they
  are soft but don't disintegrate when pressed, about 40 minutes. Drain.
  Drain tofu by wrapping it in a clean towel and pressing with a large can of
  tomatoes, about 30 minutes. Cut into 1/4 inch cubes. Rinse dried shrimp in
  water and drain.
  
  Put oil in wok, heat to medium, put in crushed garlic.  Swirl around for
  about a minute.  Add noodles and mix around for a minute or two.
  
  Add the tofu and shrimp then immediately add the liquid.  Keep stirring
  until the liquid has all been absorbed into the noodles, about a couple of
  minutes.
  
  Lower heat to low or medium-low.  Push some of the stuff aside at one end
  of wok, and break an egg in.  Immediately cover with noodles.  Do the same
  at the other end of wok.  Let the eggs cook *undisturbed* until the yolks
  are practically cooked, about three minutes.  (*Carefully* peak if unsure.)
  Slip a slotted spoon under each egg in turn, and bring upward, through the
  noodles, shaking as you go.  The idea is to break up the cooked egg into
  the rest of the mixture into tiny bits.
  
  Mix in sprouts and green onions.  Let cook for another two minutes. Turn
  off heat.  Add crushed peanuts and enough roasted red chilies to your
  desired hotness.

     16 oz Rice noodles                        1 tb Paprika
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil                     1/4 c  Sugar
      5    Garlic cloves (or more)             2    Eggs; beaten
           -- finely chopped                 1/4 lb Mung bean sprouts
      1 lb Medium shrimp                       3    Scallions
           -- shelled and deveined                  -- cut into 1/2 inch pieces
      2    Firm-style bean curd squares      1/2 c  Ground unsalted peanuts
           -- cut into 1/2 inch cubes          1    Fresh red chili pepper
    1/4 c  Pickled turnips                          -- seeded & coarsely chopped
           -- (coarsely chopped)               1    Lemon; cut into wedges
    1/2 c  White vinegar                            Coriander leaves for garnish
   3/16 c  Fish sauce                        1/4 c  Crushed red pepper (opt.)
 
  In a large bowl, soak the rice noodles in 10 to 12 cups of cold water for 2
  hours.  Drain and cover with a damp towel to retain moisture.
  
  In a wok or large frying pan, heat the oil and stir-fry the garlic until it
  is light brown.  Add the shrimp, bean curd and pickled turnips; stir in the
  vinegar, fish sauce, paprika and sugar.  When thoroughly mixed, fold in the
  noodles.  When the noodles are completely coated, spread them out to the
  sides of the wok or frying pan, leaving a space in the middle. Add the
  beaten eggs.  As the eggs cook, fold the noodles over them and stir to
  combine all of the ingredients evenly.  Stir in half of the bean sprouts,
  then add the scallions, ground peanuts and chopped chili pepper. Toss
  several times to mix well.
  
  Serve on a large platter with lemon wedges.  Top with the remaining bean
  sprouts and garnish with coriander leaves.  Serve the crushed red pepper on
  the side, for those who like it extra-spicy.

      Title: Pad Thai with Shrimp
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      8 oz Small size rice noodles             3 tb Fish sauce
      3 tb Tomato sauce                      1/2 lb Shrimp, cleaned and shelled
           -OR- tamarind paste                 1    Handful bean sprouts (fresh)
      2 tb Vegetable oil                            -- chopped once or twice
      1 tb Pickled radish                      2 oz Green onions
      3 tb Sugar                                    -- cut into 1/2 inch pieces
    1/3 c  Water or chicken stock              2 tb Finely chopped peanuts
      1    Egg                            
 
  1.  Soak the rice noodles in cold tap water about 20 minutes, until they
  are "springy".  Then drain in a colander until needed.
  
  2.  If using dried tamarind, soak the tamarind in hot water for awhile,
  then mash with a fork to soften.  Force as much of the mixture as you can
  through a seive to remove bits of bark, etc.
  
  3.  Heat oil in wok, and add the tamarind/tomato sauce, picked radish, and
  sugar.  Mix well and let heat up.
  
  4.  Add the noodles, small portions at a time, and and that water/stock.
  Mix well until all the noodles are coated with the mixture.  Add more
  liquid if necessary -- it will cook out.  Don't be easy on the noodles ~-
  chop them with the spatula or spoon some to separate them.  It may help to
  "toss" the noodles like a salad, to get them coated.
  
  5.  Beat the egg and mix with the noodles.  Add the fish sauce and shrimp.
  Mix everything thoroughly.  The noodles will tend to "clump", so stir or
  "toss" like a salad to get everything mixed, and to ensure that the egg and
  shrimp cook thoroughly.  It will help to cover the wok with a lid for a
  minute or so, then toss the mixture, then cover again. You'll know it's
  done when the shrimp are completely pink.  There may be a little browning
  of the noodles; stirring will keep them from burning.
  
  6.  Add the bean sprouts, green onions, and chopped peanuts.  Mix well,
  then turn off the heat and let stand a minute or so.  Serve.

      Title: Paht Thai
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/4 lb Dried rice stick noodles            2 tb Coarsely chopped peanuts
      2 tb Vegetable oil                            -- (dry-roasted type)
      1 tb Coarsely chopped garlic             1 c  Bean sprouts
      8    Shrimps, peeled and deveined        4    Slender green onions
      1    Egg; lightly beaten                      -- sliced in 1 inch lengths
      1 tb Fish sauce                          1    Lime; quartered lengthwise
      2 ts Sugar                          
 
  Paht Thai is a noodle dish almost everyone seems to like.  A tangle of
  slender rice noodles is sauteed with garlic, shallots, and an orchestra of
  sweet, sour, and salty ingredients that play a piquant symphony of Thai
  flavors.  A handful of fresh bean sprouts provides a cooling contrast to
  the hot, seasoned noodles, and circles of lime invite you to bring sourness
  to center stage as you begin to eat.
  
  Traditional ingredients are salty dried shrimp; crispy pieces of fried,
  pressed bean curd; sweet-sour nuggets of pickled white radish; chopped
  peanuts; flat, green garlic chives; and a balanced chorus -- sweet, sour,
  salty, hot -- of palm sugar, tamarind, vinegar, lime, brown bean sauce, and
  crushed dried red chilies.
  
  Thai cooks blithely tinker with the classic formula to create signature
  versions, and you can, too.  Siriluk Williams, owner of Sukothai Restaurant
  in Ft.  Lauderdale, Florida, gave me her recipe for home-style paht Thai. I
  love its accessible ingredients, simple steps, and delicious results.
  
  Instructions: ============= Soak rice noodles in warm water to cover for 15
  to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare all the remaining ingredients and place
  them next to the stove, along with a small serving platter. When the
  noodles are very limp and white, drain and measure out 2 1/2 cups. Set
  these by the stove as well.
  
  Heat a wok or large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon
  of the oil and swirl to coat the surface.  When the oil is very hot, drop a
  piece of the garlic into the pan.  If it sizzles immediately, the oil is
  ready.  Add the garlic and toss until golden, about 30 seconds. Add the
  shrimp and toss until they turn pink and are opaque, no more than 1 minute.
  Remove from the pan and set aside.
  
  Add the egg to the pan and tilt the pan to spread it into a thin sheet. As
  soon as it begins to set and is opaque, scramble it to break it into small
  lumps.  Remove from the pan and set aside with the shrimp.
  
  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, heat for 30 seconds, and add the
  softened noodles.  Using a spatula, spread and pull the noodles into a thin
  layer covering the surface of the pan.  Then scrape them into a clump again
  and gently turn them over.  Hook loops of noodles with the edge of the
  spatula and pull them up the sides, spreading them out into a layer again.
  Repeat this process several times as the stiff, white noodles soften and
  curl into ivory ringlets.  Add the fish sauce and turn the noodles so they
  are evenly seasoned.  Add the sugar and peanuts, turning the noodles a few
  more times.
  
  Reserving a small handful for garnish, add the bean sprouts, along with the
  green onions and shrimp-egg mixture.  Cook for 1 minute, turning often.
  Transfer the noodles to the serving platter and squeeze the juice of 2 lime
  wedges over the top.  Garnish with remaining bean sprouts and lime wedges
  and serve at once.
  
  Serves 1 as a main course, 2 as an appetizer.

      Title: Thai Chicken and Coconut Milk Soup (Tom Ka Gai or Kai Tom Ga
 Categories: Soups/stews, Thai, Poultry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     12 oz Canned coconut milk                      -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- such as Chaokoh                       -- diagonal
    1/4 lb Chicken breast                      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           -- cut into small chunks                 --OR substitute fresh ginger
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel              Hot chile peppers to taste
      1    4" piece of lemon grass                  -- cut into thin circles
           -- cut into very thin                    Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe below).
  
  Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let
  stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan, place
  the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and
  (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole
  dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the
  hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and stir to
  distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just below a boil and
  cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken pieces are finished cooking.
  Remove from heat and serve immediately with fresh cilantro leaves for
  garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh grouper
  instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead of the ginger,
  and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai birds.  We also served it
  over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who
  cares, it was wonderful.  If you can't find grouper, it'd be good with any
  tender, delicate white fish -- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or
  maybe little chunks of monkfish.  I believe I've had this with shrimp as
  well.  (Grouper, BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I
  recall, in other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white,
  very tender, and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian
  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd guess that
  Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available
  in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can usually find it
  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin Tin or
  the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in from Bangkok
  for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I could
  barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and mild.  I like
  it in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I can
  tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient demand,
  I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just eat around the
  slices of lemon grass and ginger.

           Chicken                             1 ts Galanga powder
 
  * (I sometimes leave this out.  Niels says that's defeating the whole
  point, but I think it still comes out great)
  
  Instructions: ============= Heat the coconut milk in a pot. Add everything
  else.  As the lemon grass is inedible, put it in a tea ball and immerse the
  ball in the soup so you can retrieve it later. Cook until the chicken is
  done and the soup is hot (30 minutes?). Taste to see if it needs more limes
  (it always does) or more hot peppers (it's better to start mild and build
  up to the desired level of spicyness).

  Drain and cut into 6-inch lengths, if desired.  Set aside.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the fish sauce, vinegar, sugar, and paprika,
  catsup, or tomato paste.  Set aside.

  tablespoon more oil, if necessary, and add the eggs; cook just until
  slightly set, then break them up.  Add the shrimp and stir-fry just until
  they turn pink.  Add most of the bean sprouts, the green onion, and 1/4 cup
  of the peanuts and stir-fry until the sprouts and onions are crisp-tender,
  1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a serving plate.
  
  Sprinkle with the chopped cilantro, remaining 1/4 cup peanuts, and dried
  shrimp.  Garnish with the remaining bean sprouts, cilantro sprigs, and
  lemon or lime wedges, and serve immediately.  Diners squeeze lemon or lime
  juice to taste.

      2 tb Olive Oil                           1 md Onion; cut into pieces
      1 ts Sesame Oil                          2 lg Carrots; cut into pieces
      3    Whole cloves                        1    Chicken, cut into pieces **
      2    Bay leaves                          6 c  Water
      1    Sprig of fresh thyme *        

------------------------------EVERYTHING ELSE------------------------------
           Mushrooms ***                            -- chewing on them.)
           Shrimp if you want ***              4    Kaffir lime leaves
      1    Stalk lemongrass                         Cilantro leaves as desired
           -- cut into 2 inch pieces           1 ts Chili sauce
      2 sl Galanga root                        2 tb Fish sauce
           -- (more if you like            1 1/2 tb Lemon juice

----------------------------------OPTIONAL----------------------------------
           Sliced hot peppers                       -(2 or 3 slices per serving)
 
  * (ad libbed with about 1 tsp or 1 tblsp of powdered thyme)
  
  ** (Some boneless skinless chicken pieces, plus some thighs with the bones
  bashed once with the back of a knife would be ok too -- the point being to
  get the flavor from the marrow out.)
  
  *** as many as you want, cut any way you want, of any kind you want
  
  Instructions: ============= Use a large covered stockpot. Heat olive and
  sesame oil on high heat. Add cloves, bay leaves, thyme, (these should be
  pounded a bit first to crack the fibers and release more flavor) and onion,
  carrots.  Cover 2 minutes, stir if you want.
  
  Add chicken on top, and pour ONE cup of water over the tops of the chicken.
  Cover.  Cook 5 minutes on high.
  
  Add remainder of water, cover, continue heating till it starts to boil,
  then turn heat down and simmer covered 30 minutes.  Skim off foam
  occasionally.  Remove chicken, debone, and cut into bite sized pieces.
  Strain soup, avoid getting the sediment at the bottom.  (What you do with
  the leftover veggies after making a stock is up to you.  I think they end
  up in Minnesotan hot dishes....)
  
  Take 4 cups of the stock, heat until it begins to boil, turn down the heat
  till it is just simmering.  Add galanga, lemongrass, Kaffir lime leaves
  (bash them a bit to break the fibers--it allows them to release more
  flavor).  Add mushrooms, chicken, (shrimp if you must).  Stir in the fish
  sauce, chili paste.  Cover, cook for another 5 minutes.  Serve.
  
  Add lemon juice (just have slices of lemon or lime that you can squeeze)
  cilantro, and thinly sliced jalepenos or other hot peppers at the table.
  Fresh liquorice basil also adds a nice touch.
  
  Comments/Modifications: ======================= We cheated and used
  Swansons reduced salt chicken stock for the water in the beginning because
  we used boneless skinless chicken.  Can't tell if it hurt or helped.
  
  Also had 4 shiitake mushrooms which had been soaking for several days, so
  they were cut up, and the soaking juice was added along with the chicken
  and mushrooms.  About one cup of this.  Big win.  Yum.

  Combine apple and sunflower butter (or tahini), 1 cup water, miso, amazake
  or soy milk, then pour liquid mixture over apples and bread. Stir to coat.
  Spoon mixture into a lightly oiled 2-quart casserole dish or two 9-inch pie
  plates or cake pans. Cover with lid (oven-proof).
  
  Allow mixture to sit for 2 to 4 hours before baking so bread will soak up
  flavors. Bake covered at 350F for 1 hour or until slightly firm and mixture
  pulls away from sides slightly. Then remove from oven and spoon into
  individual dessert cups. An ice cream scooper works well. Allow to cool
  slightly and then serve.

    2/3 c  Olive oil                      
 
  Preparation Time: 25 minutes Soaking Time: several hours Cooking Time: 1
  hour
  
  1. Soak beans in a large bowl of water to cover for several hours or
  overnight.  Drain.
  
  2. Place soaked beans into a pot with stock or broth and enough water to
  cover by 2 inches.  Add bay leaf and whole garlic cloves.  Heat to a boil,
  reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until beans are tender
  (about 45 minutes).  (The beans should be softer than al dente but not
  cooked to the point where they begin to disintegrate.)  Don't drain beans
  until fennel and tomato sauce is cooked.
  
  3. Meanwhile, cut stalks off fennel bulb.  Chop the feathery leaves and
  reserve.  Trim off root end of the bulbs; cut bulbs in half lengthwise and
  slice thinly.  There should be about 8 cups of fennel slices. Discard
  stalks or save for soup.  Heat 1/3 cup olive oil in a large heavy skillet;
  cook fennel over medium-low heat until wilted and translucent, about 10-12
  minutes.  Do this in batches if necessary.
  
  4. Add tomato to fennel; cook 5 or 6 minutes.  Discard garlic and bay leaf
  from beans; drain beans.  Add beans to the skillet, tossing gently to
  combine all the ingredients.  Add parsley and chopped fennel leaves. Season
  with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat, add lemon juice and remaining
  olive oil to taste.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

           Dried breadcrumbs              
 
  Melt the butter (or substitute) and saute the onion and celery over
  moderate heat for 10 minutes until soft but not brown.  Transfer to a large
  bowl.  Drain the chestnuts and add to the bowl.  Mix these ingredients
  together well.
  
  Mash the chestnuts, onion and celery, then mix into the bowl the chopped
  parsley, lemon juice and garlic.
  
  The mixture should be soft but firm enough to form into a roll, so add a
  few whole-wheat breadcrumbs, if necessary, especially if you're using
  canned chestnuts.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Pour a little of the oil into a roasting pan
  and put into the oven to heat.
  
  Form the chestnut mixture into a roll about 8 inches long, pressing it
  together carefully, then coat it well with the dried breadcrumbs.  Put the
  chestnut roll into the roasting pan and carefully turn it so that it is
  coated with hot oil.
  
  Bake for 45 minutes, until it is crisp on the outside, spooning a little
  more of the oil over the roll from time to time during the cooking.  Serve
  the Chestnut Roast cut into slices.

      Title: Chunky Granola (With No Oil Added)
 Categories: Rice/grains, Ethnic, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      8 c  Rolled oats                              - rice flour,
      1 c  Nuts (more if desired,                   - or other whole-grain flour
           -- up to double this amount)        1 ts Salt (or more, as desired)
    1/2 c  Sunflower seeds                   1/2 c  Honey (or more,
    1/2 c  Whole millet                             -- up to double this amount)
           -OR- whole buckwheat groats         1 c  -Hot water, or up to:
      3 c  Whole wheat flour (or more)         2 c  -Hot water *
           -OR- part cornmeal,                 1 ts Vanilla
 
  * Note: More water makes the granola chunkier, less makes it crumbly.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  In a large bowl or pot, combine oats, nuts, seeds,
  millet, flour, and salt.  Mix together honey, water, and vanilla, and stir
  into dry ingredients.  Spread on a lightly oiled baking sheet and squeeze
  mixture together to form small chunks, but don't crowd; the chunks need to
  bake clear through.  Roast until golden brown, about 10 to 20 minutes.
  (With the larger amount of water, reduce heat and bake longer.)  As it
  bakes the granola may need stirring to brown evenly.  Cool thoroughly
  before storing.
  
  Variations:  Replace part of the water with the freshly squeezed juice of 2
  oranges (and add the grated rinds if the oranges were not sprayed with
  pesticides), or use 2 teaspoons orange oil.
  
  For "gingerbread" granola, use half molasses (for half honey) and add 2
  teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ginger and 1/4 teaspoon cloves.
  
  For a nice change, substitute maple syrup for honey.

      1    Scallion; (green part only)              -(gomasio)
 
  Bring about 6 cups of water to the boil.  Blanch the snow peas in the water
  for 1 minute.  Remove them with a slotted spoon, place in a strainer, and
  refresh immediately under cold running water. Cut into thirds and set
  aside.
  
  In the same boiling water used for the snow peas, cook the pasta until
  tender but still chewy.  Drain well and reserve about 1/2 cup of the
  cooking water.
  
  In a serving bowl, immediately toss the hot pasta in the sesame oil to
  prevent it from clumping together.
  
  In a blender or food processor, combine the remaining ingredients, starting
  with 1-1/2 tablespoons tamari and 1/4 teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns, with
  just enough of the pasta cooking liquid to create a medium-thick sauce (the
  consistency should be like pancake batter).
  
  Toss the sauce and reserved snow peas with the pasta.  Taste and add more
  tamari and pepper if desired.
  
  Garnish with the cucumber and scallion, and sprinkle with sesame seasoning
  salt before serving.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

      Title: Couscous Patties:
 Categories: Vegetarian, Rice/grains
      Yield: 30 servings
 
     10 oz Couscous                            1 ts Mustard seeds
      6    Green chillies                    1/2 c  Urad dahl
      1    1" piece of ginger                  3    Dry red chillies
           Salt; to taste                           Curry leaves (2-3 sprigs)
      2 ts Vegetable oil                       2 tb Coconut (optional)
 
  You will be able to get mustard seeds, curry leaves and urad dahl in any
  local Indian store.
  
  Save about 2 tsp of urad dahl and soak the rest of the urad dahl in water
  for about an hour. After an hour, grind the urad dahl, green chillies and
  ginger to the consistency of pancake batter and keep aside.
  
  In a pan, heat the 2 tsp veg oil and add the mustard seeds, 2 tsp urad dahl
  (that was saved), the curry leaves and the red chillies (after cutting them
  into fine pieces). When the mustard seeds start spluttering and the urad
  dahl starts turning golden brown, add 3 1/2 cups of water and the urad dahl
  batter, mix well and close the pan. When the water starts boiling, add
  salt. (The batter already added will tend to form clusters- Don't worry -
  Can be fixed later) Add the couscous and mix thoroughly (use a potato
  masher and get rid of any clusters by mashing them well). After the mixture
  has solidified, (This should not take more than 5-10 minutes) take the pan
  out of the heat and let cool.
  
  After the mixture has cooled, take a small portion of the mixture and make
  into a patty and set aside. (You can use some water and/or oil to make the
  patties if the batter is too sticky) The amounts mentioned in this recipe
  should yield about 30 patties. Serve with sphaghetti sauce or any spicy
  chutney.
  
  WARNING: If you don't like spicy food, reduce the number of green and red
  chillies.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Yellow split peas                 1/2 ts Ground coriander
      2 ts Baking soda                         1 pn Ground cinnamon
           Vegetable oil                       1 pn Ground cloves
           -- for deep-frying                  1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Chili powder                   
 
  Rinse and sort the peas, then place in a large bowl and add enough cold
  water to cover.  Stir in baking soda.  Let soak overnight.
  
  Drain peas, rinse several times in cold water and drain thoroughly.  Let
  stand at least 30 minutes, then spread out on paper towels and let dry
  thoroughly.  In a deep, heavy saucepan, heat about 2 inches of oil to 350 F
  (180 C) or until a 1-inch bread cube turns golden brown in about 65
  seconds.  Add peas, a portion at a time, and cook until golden.  (Be
  careful when cooking peas; even when completely dry, they often cause oil
  to bubble to top of pan.)  Remove peas from hot oil with a slotted spoon
  and drain on paper towels.
  
  Turn cooked peas into a small bowl.  Sprinkle with chili powder, coriander,
  cinnamon, cloves and salt; mix to coat peas with spice mixture. Cool
  completely; store in an airtight container until ready to serve.
  
  Makes about 1-3/4 cups.

    1/2 lb Long grained rice                   1 oz Pine nuts (pignoli)
    1/2 c  Olive oil                           1 ts Sugar (more to taste)
      1 c  Water                               1 pn Thyme
      1 lg Tomato                                   Salt and pepper

      Title: Dolmadakia (Stuffed Grapeleaves with Rice)
 Categories: Appetizers, Ethnic, Vegetarian, Rice/grains
      Yield: 75 servings
 
     16 oz Grape leaves                             - or more, to taste
    3/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil                   Dill; very finely chopped
      3    Onions; more if desired         1 3/4 c  -Hot water
           (shredded or minced finely)       3/4 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Rice                              1/4 ts Pepper
      1    Lemon, juiced                  
 
  Sautee the onion with half the oil. Add the rice and let cook for a few
  minutes. Add the dill, the hot water and salt and pepper. Boil for about 5
  minutes. Let it cool.
  
  Steam the grape leaves and rinse with plenty of water in a collander.
  
  Wrap the rice mixture with the grape leaves. This is the most difficult and
  time consuming part, although after you are through it a couple of times
  you enjoy it the most. It is better if two people work on it
  simultaneously, talking, joking etc. You want to make them small in size
  (about 1-2 inches.) Do not hesitate to cut big leaves in half. Discard the
  central stem of these leaves and if you can reduce (with a sharp knife) any
  other tough stems it would be good. You want to wrap the rice very tightly.
  You place the rice in one end, fold from the short end and the two sides
  and then roll while pushing the rice downwards to pack it really tight. You
  have to do it a couple of times to understand. If they are not tightly
  packed they will unroll later. Also be careful to wrap totally, do not
  leave any holes.
  
  You arrange the dolmadakia in a casserole, tightly. Make more than one
  layers. Add the lemon juice, the rest of the olive oil and 1 1/2 cups of
  hot water. Cover them with a plate or something to keep them in place. Let
  them simmer for 35 minutes.
  
  Serve then cold, with strained yogurt or taramosalata. Enjoy.

      Title: Dolmades Yialandzi (Stuffed Grapevine Leaves)
 Categories: Ethnic, Appetizers, Vegetarian
      Yield: 60 servings
 
    3/4 c  Olive oil                         1/2 bn Fresh parsley; chopped
    1/2 sm Onion; chopped                  1 1/2    Lemons (or more), juice only
      8    Scallions; chopped fine                  Salt & freshly ground pepper
      2 lg Garlic cloves; chopped              1 c  Hot water
      1 c  Raw long-grain rice                 1 lb Jar grapevine leaves
      1 bn Fresh dill; chopped            
 
  Heat the 1/2 cup oil in a skillet.  Add the onion and scallions and saute
  for about 5 minutes, until soft and transparent.  Add the garlic and cook
  for a few minutes, then add the rice, dill, parsley, lemon juice, salt,
  pepper, and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil.  Stir well, then add the hot
  water.  Cover and simmer about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.
  
  Meanwhile, carefully remove the grapevine leaves from the jar, leaving the
  brine in the jar.  Wash grapevine leaves thoroughly and drain, then with a
  sharp knife cut the heavy stems from the leaves.  (If using fresh grapevine
  leaves use the same procedure, parboiling leaves for 5 minutes when not
  tender, then drain.)  Line an enameled pan with a few heavy grapevine
  leaves and set aside.  To stuff a grapevine leaf, put it on your working
  surface rough side up and stem end near you, and place a teaspoonful of the
  rice mixture near the stem end.  Using both hands, fold the part of the
  leaf near you up and over the filling.  Then fold the right side of the
  leaf over the filling, then the left side, and roll tightly and back away
  from you and toward the pointed end of leaf.  Place the "dolma", seam side
  down, in the prepared pan.   Continue stuffing grapevine leaves until the
  mixture has been used.  (If any grapevine leaves remain, replace in the
  reserved brine for future use.)  Place an inverted plate on the dolmades,
  then add enough water to cover the dolmades (about 1 to 1-1/2 cups). Bring
  to a boil, then cover the pan, lower the heat, and simmer as slowly as
  possible for 1-1/4 hours, then taste one to see if the rice is tender, and
  continue cooking slowly if necessary. Cool, then chill. Serve cold, as an
  appetizer or as an entree.
  
  Note:  An important variation, particularly in Macedonia and Thrace: add a
  few tablespoons of raisins and pine nuts to the filling when adding the
  rice.  Also, you may vary the size of dolmades as you wish by adding 1-1/2
  teaspoons of the filling.  However, be consistent to allow them to cook at

      Title: Drunkard's Noodles (Gueyteow Pad Ki Mow)
 Categories: Thai, Vegetarian, Pasta
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 tb Oil                                      -- roughly chopped
      1    Garlic clove; finely chopped        6    Sweet basil leaves
      2 sm Fresh red or green chilis           1 ts Dark soy sauce
           -- finely chopped                   2 tb Light soy sauce
      4 oz Sen yai noodles                   1/2 ts Sugar
      1 sm Onion; cut into segments            1 sm Sweet red or green pepper
      1 md Tomato; cut into segments                -- finely chopped
      4    Kaffir lime leaves             
 
  This is a favourite hangover dish - the chilis kick-start the benumbed body
  while the lime leaf refreshes and clears the jaded palate.
  
  In a wok or frying pan/skillet, heat the oil until a light haze appears.
  Add the garlic and chilis and fry until the garlic is golden brown.  Add
  the noodles, stir, add the remaining ingredients and stir well until the
  peppers begin to cook but are still al dente.  Turn on to a dish.

 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Edensoy (Original)                  1 tb Maple Syrup (or sugar)
  2 2/3 c  Oil                                 1 ts Salt
      2 tb Cider Vinegar                 

--------------------------------NOW TRY THIS--------------------------------
 
  Directions: Place soy milk in food processor (or blender).  Put on lowest
  setting.  Drizzle oil into soy milk.  Add other ingredients. I add about
  the same amount of lemon juice in addition to the vinegar. Someatimes I add
  one tablespoon of dry mustard.  You've got to try adding basil and/or sage
  and/or oregeno.
  
  I've also never had a problem adding all the vinegar, syrup, salt, etc. to
  the soy milk first and then adding the oil.
  
  You cannot fail.  Try it.
  
  I got the basic recipe from Shirley Wilkes-Johnson.  She is a gourmet cook
  and inventor.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 md Eggplants (1 lb ea.)              1/2 ts Allspice; more if necessary
    1/4 c  Olive oil                         1/4 c  Dry white wine
    1/3 c  Chopped scallions                   2 tb Tomato paste; MIXED WITH:
           -=OR=- Shallots                   1/2 c  Water
      1    Garlic clove; sliced (opt.)              Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley             1/2 c  Bread crumbs
      2 tb Chopped fresh fennel or dill   
 
  Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise.  With a small knife, cut away the
  eggplant flesh from the skin without breaking the skin (if planning to
  stuff the shells, leave 1/4-inch of the flesh with the skin as a firm base)
  and set the shells aside.  Dice the eggplant flesh and push through the
  medium blade of a meat grinder as quickly as possible to avoid
  discoloration.  (Or the eggplant may be pureed in a blender or food
  processor.)
  
  Heat the oil in a frying pan and saute the scallions and garlic.  Add the
  parsley, fennel, allspice, wine, and the diluted tomato paste.  Stir in the
  eggplant pulp, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 20 minutes.
  Taste to adjust seasonings.  Add the bread crumbs to absorb excess liquid.
  
  Stuff the eggplant shells, if desired, and place in an oiled baking dish.
  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 35 minutes.  Serve warm - or
  particularly good - cold.

  well. Slowly add the flour until a mass forms. On a floured board, knead
  the dough for 10 minutes or until it is smooth and tiny bubbles form.
  (note: this recipe makes a stickier dough than usual)
  
  Reserve a 1-inch piece of dough. With floured hands spread the dough out on
  an ungreased pizza pan. Using a sharp knife, score the dough in a design
  similar to the spokes of a bicycle wheel. Place the reserved ball of dough
  in the center of the scored dough. Cover and let rise one hour.
  
  Bake at 350F  for an hour or until golden brown. Combine the topping
  ingredients in a small bowl. While still warm brush the bread with topping.
  Yield: 1 16-inch loaf.

  for 3-5 minutes, turning from time to time until it is golden all over. Now
  arrange the steamed vegetables in layers on fat platter, potatoes, then
  bean sprouts, carrots & cucumber. Put the tomatoes and tofu on top. For the
  sauce, heat the oil in a wok or large pan. Stir fry the garlic, onion, and
  chili for 2-3 minutes. Add the peanut butter, lemon juice or vinegar and
  coconut milk and simmer for 2-3 minutes. The sauce should be thick but
  pourable so add more lemon juice/coconut milk if necessary. To serve, pour
  the hot sauce over the vegetables and garnish with scallion, onion slices.

  1 1/4 tb Olive oil                         1/4 c  Gluten flour
      2 c  Coarsely chopped parsnips           2 ts Nut yeast
    3/4 c  Finely diced onions                 1 ts Salt
      1 tb Minced garlic                     1/4 ts White pepper
    1/2 c  Garbanzo flour                           Peanut oil; for frying
 
  Saute vegs in oil until onions are translucent and parsnips are soft.
  Process until a smooth paste is formed.  Add all remaining ingredients
  except peanut oil and blend until well mixed.  Heat oil in a 3" deep
  skillet to 375.  Fill the bowl of a tablespoon w/batter and use a second
  spoon to scoop it into the oil.  It may help to oil the spoon, but I
  haven't had any problems.  Don't fry more than four at a time because they
  get done in less than a minute and if you leave them longer they'll burn
  and the fat content will skyrocket.  Drain and serve.
  
  For the tomato sauce I recomend your basic homemade tomato sauce w/o any
  bay leaf but some extra red wine.  Figger it out for yourself.  If you
  can't make your own tomato sauce you've already read too far;-)

    1/2 c  Light corn syrup                  1/3 c  Wheat germ

      3 c  Quick oats *                             -you want to add
    1/2 c  Sunflower seeds                
 
  *Note: (I substitute half quick oats and half crisped rice)
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Grease the bottom of a 9x12 (9x13?) baking dish
  (glass works best).  In a large bowl, combine the first 5 ingredients and
  stir well (it should be sort of a paste).  Stir in remaining ingredients.
  You can add in whatever you want, so long as the mixture is sticking
  together in several large clumps.  Press the mixture into the baking pan (
  you can use your fingers -- it's not very sticky).  Bake at 350 for 15 - 20
  minutes (until it turns golden brown).  Cool completely and cut into bars.
  Voila!

      4 oz Green papaya                        2 tb Lemon juice
      1    Garlic clove                        3 tb Light soy sauce
      3 sm Red or green chilis                 1 ts Sugar
      1 tb Roast peanuts                       1 md Tomato
      1 oz Long beans; chopped into                 -- chopped into segments
           - 1-inch (2.5 cm) lengths           2 lg Chinese cabbage leaves
           - OR - French beans            
 
  Peel the outer skin from the green papaya and finely shred the flesh on a
  cheese grater or chop very finely into long thin shreds.  Set aside.  In a
  mortar, lightly puond the garlic, add the chilis and lightly pound while
  occasionally stirring with a spoon to prevent the resulting paste from
  thickening.  Add the long beans and slightly bruise them.  Add the shredded
  papaya, lightly pound and stir until all the ingredients are blended
  together.  Add the lemon juice, soy sauce and sugar and stir into the
  mixture.  Finally add the tomato, stirring once.  Arrange the Chinese
  cabbage leaves on a serving dish and turn the yam on to them.  Diners
  should tear off a section of cabbage leaf to use as a scoop for the yam,
  the two being eaten together.  This dish is especially good with sticky
  rice.

 Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Dressings
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Large button mushrooms                   -- wiped clean

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 c  Olive oil                           1 tb Fresh cilantro or basil
      4    Garlic cloves; minced                    -- (chopped)
      1 ts Red pepper flakes; crushed        1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Fresh parsley, chopped            1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper

----------------------------COLD TOMATO DRESSING----------------------------
      3    Tomatoes; peeled, seeded          1/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
           -- and chopped                      1    Lime; juiced
      3    Shallots; minced                    2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
    1/4 c  Sherry wine vinegar                 2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
    1/4 c  Tomato juice                             -OR- basil
 
  Cecila came up with this combination for actress Darryl Hannah, a
  vegetarian who cooks for meat eaters.  The Philippines-inspired cold tomato
  and lime dressing is compatible with grilled fish or chicken as well as
  mushrooms.  To prevent the bamboo skewers from splintering in the heat of
  the fire, soak them in cold water for about half an hour and place them in
  the freezer for a few minutes before cooking.
  
  Combine all marinade ingredients in a glass or ceramic bowl.  Add the
  mushrooms, toss to coat and set aside to marinate for 1 hour at room
  temperature.

  bean curd squares from the wok, drain them well on paper towels, and allow
  them to cool thoroughly. Drain and discard the oil. Take each of the bean
  curd squares and, with a knife, split it slightly open on one side so a
  pocket is formed. Place a spoonful of cooked filling in each of the
  pockets. Continue to fill the squares until you have used all the bean
  curd. Wipe the wok clean, reheat, and add 1 tablespoon oil. Then add the
  garlic and ginger, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Then add the rest of the
  ingredients except the cornstarch mixture and sesame oil. Bring the mixture
  to a boil, return the fried bean curd pieces and cook over medium heat for
  3 minutes. Now add the cornstarch mixture, stir gently to combine, and then
  add the sesame oil. Give the mixture a final turn and serve at once. Serves

    1/4 ts -Salt                               2 ts Lemon juice
      2 tb Vegetable oil                  
 
  This is a Madhur Jeffrey recipe, published in the Toronto Sun. "Jaffray was
  in town last week teaching at the Bonnie Stern School of Cooking. Using
  ingredients available locally, primarily in the shops along Gerrard just
  west of Coxwell, she wowed the classes with her masterful teaching,
  attention to detail and wonderful aromatic dishes. She also proved how good
  and easy Indian cooking can be. ...
   Jaffray taught us how roasting, crushing and grinding bring out different
  qualities in a spice. Crushing mustard seeds, for example, brings out their
  heat but tossing them 'til they pop in hot oil calms the heat and brings
  out a sweet nuttiness. Black mustard seeds, the finest mustard seeds are
  essential and inexpensive ingredient, found in Indian groceries."
  
  Trim and peel and grate carrots. In a bowl, toss with salt and set aside.
  In a small heavy pan over medium heat, heat oil. When very hot, add mustard
  seeds. As soon as the seeds begin to pop, in a few seconds, pour oil and
  seeds over carrots. Add lemon juice and toss. SERVES:4 Serve at room
  temperature or cold.

  skillet and mash with a spatula.  Let it simmer in its own water until
  reduced to small crumbs.  Snap the ends off the green beans and place in
  boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes.  Immerse in iced water, drain, and cut
  into 1/2-inch-long pieces.
  
  B.)   In a heated skillet, saute sesame oil, hijiki, carrots, age, and tofu
  (all completely drained of water).  When ingredients have acquired a shiny
  appearance, add dashijiru, shoyu, sake and mirin.  Reduce heat to low and
  cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has been absorbed.  Turn off heat
  and add green beans.

    1/3 c  Besan (chick pea) flour             4    Hot green chilies
    1/4 c  Mashed tofu                       1/4 c  Cilantro
    3/4 c  Water                               1 sl Ginger (1/2")
      3    -to                                 2 tb Chopped onion
      4 tb Margarine                         1/2 ts Salt; to taste
      2    -to                                 4 sl Bread *
 
  * (I like sourdough, and I recommend not using a really dark type.)
  
  Put everything but the bread and margarine into the blender/food processor/
  other implement of destruction and blend until the herbs are medium
  chooped. Pour the resulting batter into a wide shallow dish. (She says
  it'll keep three days covered in the frig, if you plan meals that far
  ahead.  I don't.)
  
  Melt the margarine in a big skillet or frying pan.  Soak one slice of bread
  at a time in the batter until pretty gloppy, then toss into the skillet and
  fry until the bottom is medium brown, then flip and cook about another
  minute.
  
  Serve right off the stove.

      Title: Jamaican Rice and Peas
 Categories: Vegetarian, Rice/grains
      Yield: 4 servings
 
 
    1 c  dried red kidney beans, washed
         coconut milk (see NOTE)
    1 ea sprigfresh thyme
    1 ea clove garlic, crushed
    1 ea green onion, chopped
         salt, to taste
    3 sl hot pepper, such as Scotch Bonnet (optional) 2 1/4 c uncooked
  long-grain, regular or parboiled rice In a medium saucepan with a
  tight-fitting lid, place the washed beans. Add the coconut milk and bring
  to boil.  Reduce the heat. Cook until the beans are tender, 1 to 2 hours.
  Add the thyme, garlic, green onion, and salt. Add the hot pepper if
  desired. Simmer for a few minutes. Add the rice.
  
  The liquid should come up to 1-inch above the rice.  Add water if needed.
  Cover the pot.  Bring to a boil again.  Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 15
  minutes (for regular rice) to 20 minutes (for parboiled). It should not be
  necessary to add more water, but if to much liquid boils away, replace it
  with boiling water.
  
  The rice is ready when the liquid disappears and the grains of rice are
  separate.  Stir just before serving to evenly distribute the red kidney
  beans. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
  
  NOTE:  For coconut milk, crack 1 mature coconut with a hammer, cut off
       the brown shell, and grate the coconut meat.  Into a bowl, add
       the coconut meat and 6 cups of water.  Mix well, then squeeze to
       extract as much liquid as possible.  Press through a sieve and
       use as directed above.
  
       Etoria says his preferred method to separate the coconut
       meat from the brown shell is with a butter knife ("or the
       dullest knife you have") to prevent cuts.  Slip the knife
       between the white flesh and the shell, and it should come
       away easily.

      Title: Kaz's Vegetable Casserole
 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables, Casseroles
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4    Mushrooms                         1/2 ts Cinnamon
      2    Onions                              1 tb Natural or hazelnut yoghurt
      5    Mange tout                          1 tb White wine vinegar
    220 g  Chick peas                          2 ts Brown mustard seeds
    400 g  Tomatoes with chili spices     
 
  White grape juice is just as good as white wine if you want to avoid the
  alcohol. The recipe works well without either.
  
  I made this one up when I couldn't be bothered to follow a recipe, so I'd
  be interested to know what you think of it. It is also nice with a crumble
  topping - I use an ordinary wholemeal crumble mix and add sunflower seeds
  to it, or cashew nuts, to give it a slightly nutty taste.
  
  Preparation: chop the onions into 2cm pieces and finely dice the
  :            mushrooms.
  
  Add all the vegetables to a casserole dish, then add the spices, chickpeas,
  yoghurt and white wine. If possible leave to marinate for a couple of hours
  to let the vegetables absorb the taste.
  
  Microwave on high (650w oven) for 15 minutes, or longer if you want the
  vegetables to be soft rather than crunchy - say 20 minutes.
  
  Serve with Biryani rice - I use brown rice with lentils, almonds, sultanas
  and a mixture of vegetables such as carrots and broccoli.

      Title: Koushari (Lentils, Macaroni and Rice in Oil)
 Categories: Ethnic, Vegetarian, Rice/grains, Pasta
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Ads iswid (brown lentils)           1 c  Short grain rice
           Water                               2 tb Olive oil
           Salt                                1 c  Tomato puree
      1 c  Small macaroni noodles        

---------------------------------TA'LEYA II---------------------------------
      2 lg Onions                              1    Garlic clove (or more)
    1/4 c  Olive oil                                -- finely chopped
 
  This is classed as an 'oil' dish by Coptic Egyptians and is prepared during
  periods of fasting when animal products cannot be taken.  You may cook the
  lentils, macaroni and rice simultaneously in 3 pots, or if, like me, you
  like to keep pots to a minimum, use the method given.  This is the way they
  prepare it in Egypt anyway.
  
  Place lentils in a sieve and wash well under running water.  Place in a
  large pot and add 3 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt.  Bring to the boil,
  then simmer for 1 hour until tender but still intact.  Drain and keep
  aside.
  
  Clean same pot and add 4 cups water.  Bring to the boil, add 2 teaspoons
  salt and the macaroni.  Stir constantly until water returns to the boil and
  cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes until tender.  Stir occasionally. Drain and
  keep aside.  Clean pot again and dry.
  
  Wash rice well in sieve under running water and drain.  Heat oil in pot and
  fry rice over medium heat for 2-3 minutes.  Add 2 cups water and 1 teaspoon
  salt and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally.  Cover and simmer over
  low heat for 15 minutes or until tender.  Leave covered off the heat for 5
  minutes for grains to separate.
  
  Prepare the ta'leya (directions below), add tomato puree and bring to the
  boil.
  
  Add lentils and macaroni to cooked rice and toss together lightly with a
  fork.  Pour hot ta'leya and tomato mixture on top, toss again and cover
  pot.  Leave over low heat for 10 minutes.  Serve hot.
  
  TA'LEYA: Halve peeled onions lengthwise then slice thinly to give
  semicircles.  Heat olive oil in a pan, add onions and fry over medium heat
  until golden brown.  Add garlic and cook a minute longer.

  quarters and remove the chokes. Dice the trimmed hearts into small pieces.
  Put them in the acidulated water as you work. Keep the garlic cloves whole.
  Warm the olive oil and add the leeks, drained artichokes, garlic, potato,
  lettuce or sorrel, parsley and mint. Season with the salt, add 1/2 cup
  water and stew gently until the vegetables are wilted, about 5 minutes. Add
  the peas and the rest of the water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat
  and simmer, partially covered, for 20 minutes or until the artichokes are
  cooked. Taste for salt. Puree the soup or leave it as is and serve with the
  freshly ground pepper, add a few good pinches of chervil or parsley, a
  spoonful of olive oil drizzled into each soup plate and a dusting of
  cheese.

      Title: Lentil Burgers
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 c  Dried red lentils                   1 lg Onion; finely chopped
           -Water, to cook                     2    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 c  Bread crumbs                             - more to taste
           - (preferably wholewheat)                Salt & pepper to taste
 
  Wash lentils thoroughly & pick out any sticks & stones & grit which might
  get in them.  In a large pot, bring the water to a rolling boil.  Add
  lentils & cook for 20-25 minutes until the lentils start to puree.  Drain &
  let cool. It is not necessary to let them get cold.
  
  Transfer the cooked lentils to a large mixing bowl.   Add bread crumbs,
  garlic & onion & mix thoroughly.  Season well.
  
  You then can experiment with herbs & spices.  I usually add loads of cajun
  spice, with healthy measures of parsley, basil & majoram.  You could try
  thyme or sage.  It is your choice.
  
  If the mixture does not hold together well enough, add more bread crumbs.
  Form into patties & then cook as you would a regular hamburger in a little
  oil.  Or barbecue.  If they are really dry, then they hold together well
  enough to barbecue.
  
  Serve in buns with old fashioned dijon mustard & chips ooops, errrr fries.

      Title: Lentil-Walnut Burgers
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    3/4 c  Dry lentils                       1/2 c  Walnuts; finely minced
  1 1/2 c  Water                               1 sm Celery stalk; finely minced
      2 ts Cider vinegar                       1 ts Salt
      1 tb Margarine                                Freshly ground black pepper
      1 c  Onion; finely minced              1/2 ts Dry mustard
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed              1 tb Dry sherry
     10 lg Mushrooms; minced                 1/2 c  Raw wheat germ
 
   This takes about 40 minutes to prepare: you can do "part 1" while "part 2"
  is cooking, plus about 1 hour to chill, then 15 minutes to cook.
  
   Makes between 4 to 6 servings, depending on the size of patties you make
  and the hunger of participants.
  
   Note: uncooked burgers may be individually wrapped and frozen.
  
  Part 1:  Bring lentils and water to a boil in saucepan. Lower the heat, and
  simmer, partly-covered, 30 minutes, or until lentils are soft, and liquid
  is gone.  Place in large-ish bowl.  Add vinegar, and mash.
  
  Part 2:  Saute remaining ingredients, except for wheat germ, together over
  medium-low heat 10 to 15 minutes, or until all is tender. Add to the mashed
  lentils, and mix well.  Add wheat germ and mix again. Chill for about 1
  hour.
  
  The Burgers:
  
   1. Make 4-inch patties from chilled burger-mixture.  For freezing, make
  patties, place wax paper between each patty and stack; wrap well and freeze
  (or wrap individually).
  
   2. Fry burgers in butter until brown, *or* broil about 8 minutes on each
  side.  Try putting sesame seeds in pan to keep burgers from sticking to
  pan, if it is a problem.
  
   3. Serve either as patties, or as burgers in a whole-wheat bun. Good with
  cheese melted on top, basil sprinkled on each burger is tasty also.

  ingredients in a bowl.  Add lettuce leaves & turn them gently so that all
  the leaves become coated with the dressing.

      Title: Lone Dao Jiow (Dao Jiow Coconut Sauce with Fresh Vegetables)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Thai, Sauces
      Yield: 2 servings
 
    1/2 c  Coconut Milk                    1 1/2 sm Cucumbers
   3/16 c  Brown bean sauce (dao jiow)     1 1/2 sl Green cabbage
    1/4 lb Mixed vegetables                    3    Green beans
      1 tb Palm sugar                      1 1/2 lb Shallots
      1 tb Tamarind liquid                
 
  Notes:
  
  For the mixed veg I use things like water chestnuts, green beans,
  cauliflower etc etc. The original recipe had pork and shrimp but I changed
  it, and it works fine :-)
  
  Preparation:
  
  Slice the shallots lengthways Use brown sugar if palm sugar isn;t
  available. Peel and slice the cucumbers diagonally into thick ovals trim
  the green beans cut the cabbage into two inc wedges
  
  1. In a small, heavy bottomed saucepan, bring the coconut milk to a gentle
     simmer over a low heat. Cook, stirring gently,until the coconut
     milk is fragent and it's oil glistens on the surface (about 6-8 mins)
  
  2. While it simmers, combine the bean sauce and half of the shallots in
     a mortar. Using a pestle, mash the mixture to a chunky paste.
  
  3. When the coconut milk is ready add the shallot paste and stir well.
     Add all the vegetables except the cucumbers, cabbage,green beans and
     the remaining shallots. Cook for five minutes
  
  4. Add the sugar and simmer until the shallots wilt and the sugar melts, 1
     to 2 minutes. Add the tamarind and taste the sauce, which should be a
     balance of salty, sour and sweet.
  
  5. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl and place it on a plate, garnished
     with the cucumbers, cabbage wedges and green beans. Serve warm or at
     room temperature.

      Title: Mark's Very Own Fried Rice
 Categories: Rice/grains, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 c  Cooked rice                       1/2 c  Frozen corn &/or peas
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped               1 ea 3" piece ginger root, sliced
      2 ea Garlic cloves, minced             1/2 ts Chili pieces
      1 lg Carrot, scrubbed & diced                 Soy sauce
      1 md Green pepper, diced                      Salt & pepper, to taste
 
  Ensure that the rice has been cooked ahead of time & is well cooled.
  
  Heat about 2 to 3 tb vegetable oil in a wok.  When hot, add onions & garlic
  & fry for 3 minutes.  Add the carrots & stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the
  rest of the vegetables & continue to stir-fry for 2 or 3 minutes. Toss in
  the chili pieces & ginger root.  Cook for a few seconds. Carefully stir in
  the cold rice.  Lower heat & continue to cook, stirring occasionally for 5
  minutes.  Add enough soy sauce to coat the rice & cook for a further 5
  minutes on low heat, stirring often to prevent sticking. Season if desired
  with salt & pepper.  Serve when heated through.
  
  This goes great with spicy tofu dishes or works well on its own as a main
  dish in its own right.
  
  If you desire something hotter, add more chili pieces. Use pieces rather
  than powder because they are hotter.
  
  For a variation, I sometimes toss in a few strips of tofu just before
  adding the spices.

  Life!) do not. Time the addition of the croutons to suit your taste."
  
  Preheat oven to 350F. Spread the bread cubes on a large baking sheet & toss
  with the oil. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, turning them
  every few minutes. They will take 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how fresh
  the bread is. Assemble the cucumber, peppers, green onion and parsley in a
  large bowl; leave out the tomatoes for now. Prepare the dressing: Stir the
  lemon juice, salt and garlic together until the salt dissolves. Add the
  pepper, cinnamon and allspice, then slowly beat in the olive oil. (May be
  prepared up to 12 hours ahead to this point.) Place the cut up tomatoes on
  top of the other vegetables. Pour on the dressing and toss well; add the
  croutons and toss again (see note).

  half down centre.  Line base of a deep pan with ribs and any torn leaves.
  
  Place a generous tablespoon stuffing on base of each leaf, roll up once and
  tuck in sides to contain filling.  Roll to end of leaf.  Repeat with
  remaining ingredients.
  
  Crush garlic with salt and blend in crumbled, crushed mint and lemon juice.
  
  Pack rolls flap side down in lined pan, sprinkling some of the garlic-lemon
  mixture and olive oil between layers of rolls.  Invert a plate on top of
  the rolls to keep them intact during cooking.  Add enough cold water to
  just cover rolls and put lid on firmly.
  
  Bring to the boil on medium heat, reduce to low and simmer gently for 45
  minutes.  Remove from heat and leave aside for 30 minutes.  Serve lukewarm
  or cold.

    2/3 c  Cooked chick peas                 2/3 c  White poppy seeds
      3 tb Almonds                                  Ghee for shallow frying

  first, to the steamed vegetables.
  
  In a blender, while it is running, drop in the chilies.  Add the chick
  peas, nuts & seeds & process until the peas are mashed.  Some vegetable
  water may facilitate this.  Add the cauliflower, potatoes, fresh peas, if
  using, & beans.  Pulse on & off till they are coarsely mashed.  Transfer to
  a mixing bowl, add the steamed vegetables, salt, pepper, turmeric & garam
  masala.  Mix well.  Divide into portions.
  
  Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.  Flatten a portion into an almond
  shaped cutlet, 1/2 inch thick & place on the sheet.  Cover & refrigerate
  for 30 minutes.
  
  Whisk the soy milk, cornstarch & flour in a flat bowl until smooth.  Dip
  each cutlet into the batter, roll in poppy seeds & set aside briefly to air
  dry.

      Title: Mjaddra (Lentils with Rice)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Ethnic, Rice/grains
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Lentils                             1 tb Salt
    3/4 c  Uncooked rice                     1/4 ts Cumin
      2 md Onions; chopped                   1/2 ts Allspice or bhar
    1/2 c  Olive oil                      
 
  Clean and wash the lentils and boil them until tender.  Mash and strain
  into a separate pot.  Add the rice, salt, and spices, and mix well.  In a
  pan, saute the chopped onions in oil until golden.  Add them with the
  frying oil to the lentils and rice.  Bring the mixture to the boil with
  enough water to cover and simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes, until
  the rice is cooked, stirring regularly to prevent sticking.  Serve lukewarm
  or cold with radishes and spring onions or a cabbage salad.
  
  That's the recipe straight from the book.  I make a couple changes: first
  of all, I'm a bit liberal with the cumin and allspice - I don't use
  measuring spoons, and I'm sure I get more than the 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon.
  Bhar, btw, is described by the book as "a spice blend made of cloves,
  cinnamon and nutmeg.  It is very similar in flavor to allspice, which may
  be substituted for it."  I use brown basmati rice, so I have to boil it for
  more than 10 minutes; this means I have to keep adding water to it so it
  doesn't dry out.
  
  I mean to go back to the restaurant I first had this dish at and ask them
  what spices they use, since theirs is both spicier and darker than mine.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 c  Dried Lentils;                           - and turning brown
           - cooked until soft, drain.         2    Garlic cloves (or more)
      1 lb Green beans                              - (saute with the onions)
           - boiled or steamed until         1/4 c  Unsweetened peanut butter
           - cooked, but not mushy                  - (like Laura Scudders)
    1/4 c  Peanuts (or more)                        - optional
    1/2 c  Chopped walnuts                          Salt & pepper to taste
      2 c  Diced onions; sauteed in oil             Spike seasoning
           - until very soft                        - (if you have it)
 
  Blend it all in the food processor until smooth.  I do everything
  separately, then mix it all together because my food processor is not big
  enough to do it all at once.
  
  Serve as a sandwich spread, or on crackers.
  
  This recipe makes *a lot*.  I think it freezes well, just stir well after
  it thaws, and make sure the lentils and green beans are well drained. Serve
  with crackers or make sandwiches with it.  This recipe makes quite a lot of
  spread.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lg Potato; cooked, peeled             10    Wood ears; soaked to soften,
           -and sliced 1/4 inch thick               - tough ends removed,
      2 tb Flour                                    - cut in slivers
           Peanut oil; for frying            1/2 ts Salt
      1 sm Onion; sliced                     1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 lb Snow peas                         1/3 c  Water
 
      Sprinkle potatoes with flour and deep-fry until golden.
   Drain and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the oil, reheat an
  add onion. Stir-fry 10 seconds and add snow peas and wood ears. Stir-fry
  another 10 seconds and add salt, sugar and water. Bring to rapid boil,
  stirring constantly, and cook until peas are just tender crisp. Add
  reserved fried potato slices, heat through and serve.
  
      Wood ears are a type of mushroom or shelf fungus. When soaked it has a
  crunchy, gelatinous texture with little taste. If you can't find them, I
  imagine that you could use the dried mushrooms although they wouldn't give
  exactly the same effect. A closer substitute would be dried jellyfish, but
  if you're some- where that sells dried jellyfish, I'm sure that they have
  wood ears as well...

    1/4 ts White pepper                    2 1/2 c  Cima mix (see below)
      1 tb Agar flakes                   

----------------------------------CIMA MIX----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onions               2 ts Salt
      2 tb Olive oil                       1 1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Whole wheat bread crumbs            1 c  Chopped spinach, packed
    1/4 lb Ground seitan                     1/4 c  Chopped roasted red pepper
    1/4 lb Fine soy grits                    1/2 c  Pistachios
    1/4 lb Hand crushed frim tofu              1 c  Green peas
    1/3 c  Nutritional yeast                   1 tb Agar flakes
      2 ts Dried marjoram                    1/2 c  Gluten flour
      2 ts Dried thyme                         2 tb Liquid lecithin
 
  Rinse tofu and pat dry.  Cube and puree in food processor with all
  ingredients except cima mix.
  
  Shape the cima mix into a 12" by 3" roll.  Sread the tofu puree on a 12" by
  28" piece of plastic wrap and roll around the cima log.  Smooth out the
  seam. Steam 30 minutes, let cool 10 minutes, slice and serve.
  
  Note:  you MUST have a steamer wide enough to support the entire roll from
  underneath!  If you don't, it will slip and come unrolled.  It'll still get
  cooked, but rather than a pretty, colorful roll to slice you'll have a
  serious mess.  This shouldn't be a problem, but for a broke person cooking
  for nine @someone else's apartment, these harware problems have a nasty way
  of only becoming apparently an hour before mealtime. (sigh)
  
  CIMA MIX: (makes 4 1/2C  Bro Ron suggests using the extra for 'meatballs'
  or something.  Far be it from me to argue w/my hero, but remember to use a
  big enough skillet.)
  
  Saute onions in oil until translucent.  Remove from heat.  Add bread
  crumbs, tofu, seitan, soy grits, nut yeast, water and seasoning. Mix until
  evenly dispersed. Add vegs and nuts.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix agar and gluten flour.  Heat lecithin and stir into
  veg mixture, then stir in flour/agar mixture.

      2 lb Fresh young okra                    1 lb Tomatoes; skinned & sliced
    3/4 lb Onion; sliced thickly                    Salt and black pepper

----------------------------------ORANGES----------------------------------
      2    Jumbo navel oranges                      -- halved crosswise

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
      1 tb Sesame seeds                        4    Cilantro leaves (optional)
      1 tb Chopped scallion whites        
 
  FOR THE ORANGE-TAHINI SAUCE:  In a blender or food processor, combine all
  ingredients.  Refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  FOR THE FILLING:  Melt the butter or heat the oil in a medium saucepan.
  Saute the onion until soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the rice and stir to
  coat with the butter.  Add the broth, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer
  over low heat until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 45
  minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.
  
  In a large bowl, toss together the cooked rice, Orange-Tahini Sauce,
  chickpeas, and raisins.
  
  Prepare the oranges for stuffing by slicing off the rounded ends so that
  each half stands squarely on a plate.  Using a paring knife, carve out the
  fruit, cut it into bite-size sections, and toss it into the rice mixture.
  Once the fruit has been removed, cut away as much of the white portion of
  the peel as possible, leaving the shell intact.
  
  Set the orange shells on a serving dish and fill them with the rice
  mixture.  Garnish each with a sprinkling of sesame seeds and scallions
  topped with a whole cilantro leaf.

  sauce. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water. When it is
  done, scoop it out and add it directly to the greens and beans. Toss them
  together, then turn into a heated serving dish. Drizzle the remaining olive
  oil over the top, season with plenty of pepper and freshly grated cheese.

      Title: Polenta
 Categories: Rice/grains, Vegetarian, Ethnic
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 tb Olive oil; or corn oil              1 ts Chopped basil
      1 c  Peeled, finely diced carrots        4 c  -Water
      1 c  Finely diced onions               1/2 c  Drained stewed tomatoes
      1 c  Finely diced celery                 2 c  Yellow corn grits; -OR-
      1 tb Minced garlic                   2 1/4 c  -Cornmeal
      2 ts Sea salt                            1 c  Cooked, drained kidney beans
    1/2 ts Finely ground black pepper     
 
  Heat the oil in a large saucepan.   Saute the carrots, onions, celery, and
  garlic, along with the salt, pepper, and basil, for about 8 minutes.  Cut
  the stewed tomatoes into small pieces and add them to the vegetables, along
  with the 4 cups of water.  Bring to a simmer.  Then add the corn grits and
  kidney beans and mix well.  Cook for about 20 minute, stirring occasionally
  to prevent burning.  (The polenta may take longer than 20 minutes to cook.
  Check by tasting.  It should have a soft, gritty texture.)
  
  Lightly oil a 2-quart mold and press the polenta into it, working out any
  air pockets.  Smooth out the surface and allow it to cool to room
  temperature.  Refrigerate the mold until it is cold.  Then unmold the
  polenta onto a tray, garnish it, and serve it in slices.
  
  NOTE: If you are using cornmeal instead of corn grits, it is best to soak
  the cornmeal separately, in 2 cups of cold water; add the remaining 2 cups
  of water to the vegetables and then combine the two mixtures.
  
  VARIATION: Millet Polenta Use 2 cups of millet and 5 cups of water in place
  of the corn grits and the 4 cups of water.

      Title: Potato Patties
 Categories: Appetizers, Ethnic, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 md Potatoes                            5 ea Fenugreek seeds
      3 tb Yellow split peas                   2 tb Chopped onions
           Salt                                3 tb Parsley
      2 tb Oil                                 1 ea Fresh hot green chili
 
  Two hours before using, boil the potatoes in their jackets.  While they are
  boiling, boil split peas in 3 cups water with a sprinkling of salt for 15
  minutes.  Remove from heat & drain very well, ensuring that you get rid of
  all the excess water. Set aside in a covered bowl.
  
  In a skillet, add the oil & heat over a medium flame until it is very hot.
  Add the fenugreek.  When they change colour, add onions & fry for 2
  minutes, till the onion starts to brown.  Add parsley, green chili & stir
  another 2 minutes.  Next, put in the split peas, a little more salt if
  desired & cook, stirring for 5 minutes or until you are sure that all the
  water has evaporated.  The mixture should become one lump.  Cover & set
  aside.
  
  Peel & mash the potatoes with a fork or hand masher, do not use an electric
  beater otherwise your patties wil lnot hold together when cooked. A few
  lumps will remain, but get it as smooth as you can.  Add somec salt & mix
  thoroughly.
  
  Divide the potatoes into 12 balls & do the same with the split pea mixture.
  Flatten each potato ball in you hand, put one portion of the split pea
  mixture in the centre.  Roll up into a ball again & flatten once more into
  a patty.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
  
  To cook the patties, you need very little oil & some patience so as not to
  lose the crust to the skillet when you turn them over.  Coat the bottom of
  the skillet with a small amount of oil.  Cook no more than two patties at
  any one time in each skillet.  Cook for 7 minutes, gently turn over & cook
  for another 7 to 8 minutes.  The patties should be reddish brown on each
  side.  Keep the heat fairly low otherwise they will burn.
  
  Serve with chutney.

      2 tb Olive oil                       1 1/2 c  Cooked pinto beans
      2 c  Finely diced celery                 4 tb Tahini
    1/2 c  Finely diced fennel                 4 tb Whole wheat flour
      1 c  Finely diced onions                      -(stone-ground)
      4 ts Minced garlic                       4 tb Gluten flour
 
  Place the quinoa in a medium saucepan along with the water and 1/2 teaspoon
  salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, until all the water has
  evaporated (about 15 minutes).  Set aside.
  
  Heat the oil in a medium saucepan.  Saute the celery, fennel, onions,
  garlic, and bell pepper, along with the salt, marjoram, and cardamom, for
  about 5 minutes.  Stir occasionally to prevent burning.  Add the cooked
  quinoa and the sesame seeds, pinto beans, and tahini to the sauteed
  vegetables.  Blend the ingredients.
  
  Mix the two flours together and blend into the vegetable and quinoa
  mixture. Line a large loaf pan with a baking sheet liner and lightly oil
  the liner.  (In lieu of the baking sheet liner, you could just oil and
  flour the pan.)  Press the mixture into the pan.  Bake at 400 degrees F for
  about 45 minutes.  (The loaf should reach an internal temperature of
  180-200 degrees F.)  Let the loaf cool, inverted, for 10 minutes before

      Title: Quinoa Tabouli
 Categories: Rice/grains, Mideast, Spices/etc., Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Water                             1/3 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
    1/2 c  Quinoa                            1/3 c  Safflower oil
      3 md Ripe tomatoes                       2 tb Fresh mint
      1 c  Parsley                                  Salt; to taste
      1 c  Scallions                      
 
  Note:  The author says that 1 tsp. dried mint could be used, but dried mint
  is nasty stuff, IMHO!
  
  Pour water into a 1-quart saucepan.  Add quinoa; bring to a boil.  Reduce
  heat to a simmer; cover.  Cook for 10 to 15 min., or until all water has
  been absorbed.
  
  While the quinoa is cooking, finely chop the tomatoes, parsley, and
  scallions.  Add lemon juice, oil, and mint to tomato mixture.  Stir in
  cooked quinoa and salt.  Mix well.
  
  Let tabouli sit in the refrigerator for a day to blend flavors.
  
  Note:  Also, she neglected to mention that tabouli is traditionally served
  at room temperature.
  
  The recipe was from Linda Najjar of Seattle, Washington, and the "Herb
  Companion" note on it said:  "Substituting quinoa for the traditional
  bulgur wheat gives this tabouli a lighter, fluffier, and slightly nutty
  taste and enables people allergic to wheat to experience the flavorful joys
  of this Middle Eastern dish."

      1 c  Dry red beans *                     2    Garlic cloves
      3 c  -Water (approx.)                         - peeled and chopped
      3 c  -Fresh water                        1    Onion; peeled and chopped
      1 tb Cumin                             1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Raw sugar                                Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb White vinegar                       1 ds Tabasco

----------------------------------FOR RICE----------------------------------
      1 c  Rice                            2 1/2 c  Water
 
  *NOTE: (red beans are not the same as kidney beans- they are smaller)
  
  Soak the beans in the water overnight or at least 8 hours. Drain the
  soaking water.
  
  Put the beans and all the rest of the ingredients into a large cooking pot.
  Bring the water to a boil, then reduce to moderate-low heat and cook for
  about 1 hour, until most of the water is absorbed. Add more water if you
  need to, and stir the beans every 10 minutes or so.
  
  When the beans have 1/2 hour to go, make the rice. Put the rice and water
  in a saucepan, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover. Simmer
  until all the water is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Then turn the heat off
  and let sit, with cover on, about 10 minutes.
  
  To serve, serve the beans over the rice.
  
  Serve with sliced avocado (aguacate), fried plaintain chips (platanos
  fritos), and cornbread (served fried like hush-puppies). For dessert serve
  fruit such as papaya with coconut, and expresso coffee (for Dominican style
  expresso: fill up your demitasse cup 1/2 full of raw sugar, then add
  outrageously strong expresso coffee!).

      Title: Rhubarb Raisin Crumble
 Categories: Vegetarian, Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      3 lb Rhubarb; trimmed *                  1 tb Finely grated orange zest***
    1/2 c  Strawberry preserves **             2 c  Granola, pref. maple walnut
    1/2 c  Raisins                                  Maple syrup to taste
 
  *Note: Rhubarb should be in 1-inch slices. **Use fruit-sweetened preserves.
  ***Use organic if possible.
  
  Combine ingredients in a heatproof pan 13x8x2 inches. The combined
  ingredients will seem dry; don't be concerned; the rhubarb will give up
  considerable liquid as it cooks. Place pan in a cold oven, set temperature
  to 375 F, and bake uncovered for 15 minutes. Stir and continue baking until
  rhubarb is tender but still firm, about 10 to 15 minutes more.
  
  Add maple syrup to taste if more sweetness is desired.
  
  Notes: This recipe makes a big batch; it can easily be cut in half. When
  stored in the refrigerator overnight, this dish takes on a pudding-like
  texture.

 Categories: Ethnic, Sauces, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    Garlic cloves                       1    Lemon; juiced
           Salt                              1/2 c  -Water
    3/4 c  Tahini                            1/2 ts Ground cumin
      1 tb White vinegar                     1/2 c  Chopped parsley
 
  Crush garlic cloves with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
  
  Place tahini in mixing bowl and beat well.  This preliminary beating
  reduces the strong flavour of the tahini.
  
  Beat in garlic and vinegar.  Gradually add lemon juice alternately with
  water.  To make a cream salad of good consistency add enough lemon juice to
  make the tahini very thick before adding water.  This way you have more
  scope in adjusting the flavour and consistency of the sauce.
  
  Add salt to taste, and more lemon juice if a sharper sauce is required.
  Blend in cumin and parsley and chill until required.  Serve as a mazza or
  as directed in recipes.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh green beans                   3 tb Pine nuts
      2 tb Kosher salt                         1 ts Chopped fresh tarragon
    1/2 lb Mushrooms                                -=OR=-
      2 tb Olive oil                         1/4 ts -Dried tarragon
      1 tb Unsalted butter                
 
  SNAP BOTH ENDS OFF THE BEANS and pull off any strings. Cut large pole beans
  crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Don't cut smaller French haricots verts. Fill
  a mixing bowl or medium pot with 4 cups cold water and add 1 tray of ice
  cubes. Set aside. Bring 4 quarts of water with 2 tablespoons kosher salt to
  a boil over high heat and add the beans. The water will stop boiling when
  you add the beans. After it has returned to the boil, cook the beans,
  uncovered, until tender but still crisp. This will take from 3 to 5 minutes
  depending on the size and age of the beans. Remember that this is only a
  preliminary preparation so do not overcook the beans. Drain the beans and
  place them immediately into the ice water. Stir until cool, then drain.
  Spread the beans on towels and pat dry. Meanwhile, slice mushrooms thinly
  and set aside on a plate. Heat the oil and butter in a medium skillet over
  medium heat and add the pine nuts and mushrooms. If using dried tarragon,
  add it now. Cook, stirring, about 5 minutes. Add the green beans and fresh
  tarragon and cook until beans are hot, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to
  a serving platter and serve immediately.

      Title: Scallion Cakes
 Categories: Breads, Vegetarian, Oriental
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 lb All-purpose flour                        -OR- kosher salt
    1/4 ts Baking powder                       5    Scallions; coarsely chopped
    1/2 ts Sugar                               5 tb Vegetable oil (or more)
      2 ts Coarse-grain sea salt          
 
  Place the flour in a mixing bowl.  Sprinkle evenly with the baking powder
  and sugar.  Mix with a wooden spoon.  Add the water gradually, stirring and
  mixing with the wooden spoon.  Knead the dough for 3-4 minutes.  Cover it
  with a damp cloth and leave for half an hour, then knead again for 2-3
  minutes.  Divide the dough into ten portions and form into narrow strips
  8-10 inches long.  Flatten the strips with a rolling pin and ten bands of
  pancake thickness.  Sprinkle each band with salt and then with chopped
  scallions.  Roll the bands lengthwise into long double-thickness
  spaghetti-shaped strips.  Hold one end of the strip and turn the other end
  around in circles until the concentric rings form themselves around the
  center into a spiral pancake.  Flatten the pancake with the palm of the
  hand.  Repeat until the dough has been made into ten spiral pancakes.
  
  Heat the oil on the bottom of a large flat-bottomed frying pan.  When hot,
  lift the handle of the frying pan so that the surface of the pan is evenly
  greased.  Place the spiral pancakes on the surface of the pan.  Fry over
  low heat for 2-1/2 to 3 minutes and turn the pancakes over.  Repeat and fry
  gently until the pancakes are evenly browned on both sides.

      Title: Scrambled Tofu
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 tb Olive or canola oil                      - mashed or crumbled
      1 lg Onion                             1/2 ts Dried leaf oregano
           - peeled & coarsely chopped       1/4 ts Tumeric (optional)
      2 lg Garlic cloves                     1/4 c  Finely chopped green olives
           - peeled & finely chopped                -(pitted)
      6    Scallions; thinly sliced,           1    Sheet nori sea vegetable
           - (keep white & green parts              - finely shredded (optional)
           -  separate)                             Tamari or soy sauce
    1/4 lb Mushrooms; thinly sliced                 - to taste
      1 sm Red bell pepper                          Freshly ground black pepper
           - seeded and diced                       Hot sauce (optional)
      1 lb Silken or soft tofu; drained   
 
  Great for brunch or a light supper dish, this recipe can easily be doubled
  to serve 4 to 6.  Silken tofu results in a very soft-cooked texture, while
  soft tofu will be slightly firmer.
  
  NOTE: Tumeric will give a faint yellow color to the mixture, but will not
  contribute significantly to the taste.
  
  DIRECTIONS: In a large skillet or wok, heat the oil and saute the onion,
  garlic, and white of scallions until the onions turn light brown, about 4
  to 5 minutes.
  
  Add the mushrooms, red pepper, tofu, oregano, and tumeric (if using), and
  continue to saute over medium-high heat for another 3 minutes, stirring
  frequently.  Stir in the scallion greens, olives, nori (if using), soy
  sauce and pepper to taste.  Pass optional hot sauce.

      Title: Seitan - Method I
 Categories: Information, Vegetarian, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      6 c  Whole wheat bread flour                  - of gluten in the flour)
           -(Stone-ground), -=OR=-           1/2 c  Tamari
           -Hi-gluten unbleached white        12 sl Fresh ginger
      3 c  Water (or more),                         -(each about 1/8" thick)
           -(depending on the amount           1    Piece kombu, about 3" long
 
  Yield: 14 ounces uncooked; 16 ounces cooked Time: 1 hour preparation; 2
  hours cooking
  
  Mix the flour and water by hand or in a machine to make a medium-stiff but
  not sticky dough.  Knead the dough by hand on a breadboard or tabletop,
  until it has the consistency of an earlobe, or by machine until the dough
  forms a ball that follows the path of the hook around the bowl.  You may
  need to add a little extra water or flour to achieve the desired
  consistency.  Kneading with take about 10 to 12 minutes by machine.  Allow
  the dough to rest in a bowl of cold water for about 10 minutes.
  
  While the dough is resting, prepare the stock.  In a large pot, bring to
  boil 3 quarts of water.  Add the tamari, ginger, and kombu, and cook for 15
  minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.  This stock must be cold
  before it's used.  (The cold liquid causes the gluten to contract and
  prevents the seitan from acquiring a bready texture.)  You will be using
  this stock to cook the seitan later.
  
  To wash out the starch, use warm water to begin with.  Warm water loosens
  the dough and makes the task easier.  Knead the dough, immersed in water,
  in the bowl.  When the water turns milky, drain it off and refill the bowl
  with fresh water. In the final rinses, use cold water to tighten the
  gluten.  If you wish, save the bran by straining the water through a fine
  sieve; the bran will be left behind.  Save the starch by allowing the milky
  water to settle in the bottom of the bowl; slowly pour off the water and
  collect the starch, which you can use for thickening soups, sauces, and
  stews.
  
  When kneading, remember to work toward the center of the dough so that it
  does not break into pieces.  After about eight changes of water, you will
  begin to feel the dough become firmer and more elastic.  The water will no
  longer become cloudy as you knead it.  To make sure you have kneaded and
  rinsed it enough, lift the dough out of the water and squeeze it.  The
  liquid oozing out should be clear, not milky.
  
  To shape the seitan, lightly oil a 1-pound loaf pan.  Place the rinsed
  seitan in the pan and let it rest until the dough relaxes.  (After the
  dough has been rinsed for the last time in cold water, the gluten will have
  tightened and the dough will be tense, tough, and resistant to taking on
  any other shape.)  After it has rested for 10 minutes, it will be much more
  flexible.
  
  Seitan is cooked in two steps.  In the first step, the dough is put into a
  large pot with about 3 quarts of plain, boiling water.  Boil the seitan for
  about 30 to 45 minutes, or until it floats to the surface.  Drain the
  seitan and cut it into usable pieces (steaks, cutlets, 1-inch chunks, or
  whatever) or leave whole.  Return the seitan to the cold tamari stock.
  Bring the stock to a boil, lower temperature, and simmer in the stock for
  1-1/2 to 2 hours (45 minutes if the seitan is cut into small pieces).  The
  second cooking step may also be done in a pressure cooker, in which case it
  would take between 30 to 45 minutes.
  
  To store seitan, keep it refrigerated, immersed in the tamari stock. Seitan
  will keep indefinitely if it is brought to a boil in the tamari stock and
  boiled for 10 minutes twice a week.  Otherwise, use it within eight or nine
  days.
  
  VARIATIONS: Instead of boiling the seitan in plain water and then stock,
  let the seitan drain for a while after it has been rinsed.  Slice it and
  either deep-fry or saute the slices until both sides are brown.  Then cook
  it in the tamari stock according to the recipe.
  
  Seitan also may be cooked (at the second step) in a broth flavored with
  carrots, onion, celery, garlic, tamari, and black pepper, which will give
  it a flavor similar to pot roast.  Shiitake mushrooms may also be added to
  the stock.

      Title: Seitan - Method Ii
 Categories: Information, Vegetarian, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     16 c  White bread flour                   1    Onion; peeled and sliced
      6 c  -to                                 1    Piece kombu, about 4" long
      8 c  Water, or more                    1/4 c  Ginger; sliced   -=OR=-
    3/4 c  Tamari                              2 ts -Ginger powder
 
  Yield: 1-3/4 lbs uncooked; 2-1/2 lbs cooked Time: 40 to 50 minutes
  preparation: 3 to 4 hours cooking
  
  Mix the flour and water together to make a medium-stiff dough.  Knead it
  until it is elastic when pulled (about 8 to 10 minutes).  Allow the dough
  to rest for about 5 minutes in a bowl of cold water.
  
  Wash out the starch by filling a large bowl (1-1/2 to 2 gallons) with warm
  water and kneading the dough in it, underwater.  When the water turns white
  (after 1 to 2 minutes), drain it through a strainer, adding the floury
  residue back to the ball of dough.  Keep kneading, washing, and changing
  the water, until no more starch is given off.  This may take as many as
  eight rinses, about 20 to 25 minutes.
  
  Pour 6 pints of water into a large pot.  Add the tamari, onion, kombu,
  ginger, and dough, and simmer for about 3 hours.  (To speed up the cooking,
  you could cut the dough into small pieces, each about 1-1/2"; the pieces
  would cook in about one hour.)  The seitan is properly cooked when it is
  firm to the touch and when it is firm in the center.  You can check by
  cutting into the seitan.  If it is not done, it will feel like raw dough in
  the center.

           -OR- other cooking oil                   -(Optional; this dish is
      4    Pieces of seitan, 2 oz each              - more delicate without it)
           - fried and simmered                3 md Apples; peeled, cored,
           -(SEE NOTE IN DIRECTIONS)                - and thinly sliced
      6 tb Tamari                              2 tb Mirin or calvados or sherry
 
  NOTE: This recipe needs uncooked seitan.  Cut the seitan into four thin
  pieces (1/8 to 1/4 inch thick), each about 2 ounces.  The thinner the
  better.  Fry the seitan in a (little?) hot oil until lightly browned and
  then simmer it in a little water for about 30 minutes before using.  If you
  don't simmer it first, you may need to add more liquid to the recipe.
  
  Saute the onions and garlic in the oil until the onions are soft and
  translucent but not fully cooked.
  
  Place the seitan in an ovenproof baking dish and cover it with tamari,
  apple juice concentrate, and water.  Cover with the sauteed onion mixture
  and sprinkle the ground pecans over it, if you wish.  Fan the apples over
  the onions and pour the mirin on top.  Cover the dish with a tight-fitting
  lid or aluminum foil, and bake at 300 degrees F for 2 hours.  Serve hot.

  This is a fairly close approximation to what a parmigiana dish should be
  like.  It is based on the mushroom stroganoff from the American Vegetarian
  Cookbook, and comes from Renee Wheeler.

      Title: Sesame Dressing
 Categories: Sauces, Salads, Pasta, Dressings
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 lb Sugar                           1 1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 c  Red vinegar                              Tabasco; to taste
    3/4 oz Onion; chopped                    1/4 c  Salad oil
    1/8 ts Salt                              1/4 oz Toasted sesame seeds
           Paprika; to taste                        Peanut butter; to taste
      1 tb Dry mustard                              Roasted garlic; to taste
 
  Prepare like a vinaigrette dressing. The dry mustard will be the emulsifier
  for the oil and vinegar.
  
  This won't have the peanutty taste that the other has, but you can
  experiment with the addition of peanut butter and garlic in this recipe. My
  suggestion is 2 tbsp of PB and 1 tbsp of roasted garlic.
  
  Also, you may want to convert this recipe. It yields about 1 1/2 quarts.
  
  "Sea World of Florida's Polynesian Luau", Shared by John Munson
  
  Karen's note:  This recipe has been resized to make about six 2-tablespoon
  servings, so it will now yield about 3/4 cup of dressing.  The notes from
  John regarding peanut butter and roasted garlic were for the original
  recipe, so you may decrease them as desired.

     90 g  Garlic heads                        3    Lemon slices
      4    Lemons                                   Sea salt to taste

  This makes enough Skordalia for several meals. Skordalia is a tasty side
  dish. It can also be used as a relish. Keep it refrigerated.
  
  Boil the unpeeled potatoes in water (salted if required, but not
  necessary).
  
  Crush the garlic into a mixing bowl. Peel the potatoes, and add them to the
  bowl whilst they are still hot.
  
  Add a pinch of salt. Mix the garlic and potato mixture to a pulp; using a
  food processor or mixer.
  
  Alternately, add the lemon juice and olive oil gradually, until all the
  ingredients are blended into a smooth mixture.
  
  Put the mixture into a bowl, garnish with parsley, olives and the slices of
  lemon.
  
  Notes:
  
  The amount of garlic can be varied according to taste; like this it has a
  strong flavour.
  
  Skordalia can be surved as a cold side dish, with vegetables.

      Title: Soynog
 Categories: Beverages, Low-cal, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Soy milk                                 --(liquid or granules)
      1 tb Soy milk powder                   1/8 c  -to
    1/4 ts Vanilla                           1/4 c  Almonds
      1 ts Corn oil                          1/4    Nutmeg
           --(or canola oil or                 1 ts Carob powder (optional)
           --flax seed oil)                    1 pn Tumeric (optional)
      1 ts Lecithin                       
 
  Grind the almonds first in the blender dry.  Add the rest of the
  ingredients and in a blender until light and fluffy. Can be served cold or
  hot (do NOT boil!).  For variation sprinkle the top with some anise seed
  and/or coriander, or, orange or lemon rind gratings, or, powdered cardamom.
  If your soy milk is not very sweet, then add a little honey to the above.
  If you can't find soy milk powder, then try thickening the soynog with,
  say, with 1/2 to one fresh banana. If you want that slippery taste of
  "real" eggnog then just add more oil, but I think is better to simply allow
  your taste preferences to adapt and come to enjoy this soynog on its own
  terms   :-)

      Title: Spanakopita Nistisimi (Lenten Spinach Pie)
 Categories: Appetizers, Ethnic, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Curly endive                        5 tb Fruity olive oil
      3 lb Fresh bulk spinach                  1    Lemon
           -washed, large stems removed    1 1/2 c  Finely chopped fresh dill
      3 bn Large scallions                     1 ts Salt
           - white and green chopped                Freshly ground black pepper
           - together                          1 tb Rice or cracked wheat

-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour                   1 ts Baking powder
           Extra flour for rolling             5 tb Olive oil (about)
      1 ts Sea salt                            1 tb Sesame seeds
 
  Start by making the pastry.  Sift the flour with the salt and baking
  powder. Mix in about 6 tablespoons water, a little at a time, until the
  dough is gooey, but not wet.  Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus another
  teaspoonful, and a little more flour, if needed, to make a cohesive mass.
  Knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.  Cover it
  and set aside to relax for an hour or two.
  
  For the filling, separate the curly endive leaves, so the vegetable will
  cook in the same time.  Steam the spinach and endive together in a large
  pan, in the water clinging to the leaves, plus just an extra 1/2 cup. Turn
  the leaves over occasionally, so they wilt evenly.  When they are wilted,
  but not mushy, drain them in a colander, pressing firmly with the back of a
  wooden spoon to remove as much excess liquid as possible. (Reserve the
  liquid for use in soup, or drink with a squeeze of lemon juice, as the
  Greeks do.)
  
  Saute the scallions in 2 tablespoons olive oil, until barely soft.  Add a
  few tablespoons of water if they stick to the pan.  Roughly chop the cooked
  spinach and curly endive and finely grate the zest from the lemon. Then
  toss the cooked vegetables with the scallions, parsley, dill, lemon zest
  and 1 tablespoon lemon juice, salt, and pepper, adding 3 tablespoons olive
  oil. Set aside until you are ready to fill the pastry.
  
  Choose an ovenproof earthenware or glass baking dish 2 to 2-1/2 inches deep
  and about 2-quart capacity and brush the inside with oil.  Divide the
  pastry into two unequal parts, and then again into halves.  On a floured
  surface roll out one of the larger pieces of pastry. This should be large
  enough to line the dish, coming up and over the sides - this should make it
  very thin.  Fit it into the baking dish and brush it with olive oil. Do the
  same with the second piece of pastry, placing it on top of the first, and
  brush again with olive oil.
  
  Sprinkle the tablespoon of rice or cracked wheat over the bottom, to soak
  up excess juices, and fill with the spinach and herb mixture.  Roll out the
  remaining two pieces of pastry, separately, to fit the top of the dish.
  Place the first on top of the spinach, brush with olive oil, then place the
  second on top of that.  Prick the pastry with a fork in an attractive
  pattern and brush the entire top with olive oil.  Sprinkle with sesame
  seeds.  Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F for 45-50 minutes, until golden
  brown.

      1 c  Chopped spring onions               8    Fillo pastry sheets
    1/3 c  Olive oil                                Olive oil (or butter)
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley                          - for assembling rolls
      3 ts Chopped dill or fennel         
 
  SERVES: 6-8 OVEN TEMPERATURE: 180C (350F) COOKING TIME: 50 Minutes
  
  Wash spinach well and cut off any coarse stems.  Chop coarsely and put into
  a large pan.  Cover and place over heat for 7-8 minutes shaking pan now and
  then or turning spinach with a fork.  Heat just long enough to wilt spinach
  so that juices can run out freely.  Drain well in colander, pressing
  occasionally with a spoon.
  
  Gently fry onion in olive oil for 10 minutes, add chopped leek and spring
  onions and fry gently for further 5 minutes until transparent.
  
  Place well-drained spinach in a mixing bowl and add oil and onion mixture,
  herbs and nutmeg.  Blend thoroughly, adding salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Place a sheet of fillo pastry on work surface and brush lightly with olive
  oil.  Top with 3 more sheets of pasry, brushing each with oil.
  
  Brush top layer lightly with oil and place half the spinach mixture along
  the length of the pastry towards one edge and leaving 4 cm (1-1/2 inches)
  clear on each side.
  
  Fold bottom edge of pastry over filling, roll once, fold in sides then roll
  up.  Place a hand at each end of roll and push it in gently like a
  concertina.  Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.  Place rolls in an
  oiled baking dish leaving space between rolls.  Brush tops lightly with oil
  and bake in a moderate oven for 30 minutes until golden. Serve hot cut in
  portions.

 Categories: Oriental, Vegetables, Vegetarian, Sauces
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    1/2-inch-round ball tamarind      1/2 c  Packed flaked coconut
    1/4 c  -Boiling water                           -- fresh or canned,
      1 lb Thin, long eggplant                      -- unsweetened
      3 tb Light vegetable oil                 1 ts Cayenne pepper (or more)
  1 1/2 ts Minced garlic                     1/2 ts Coarse salt; or to taste
      2 ts Ground coriander                    2 tb Unsulphured molasses
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon                          -OR- Brown sugar
    1/8 ts Ground cloves                     1/2 ts Black mustard seeds

---------------------------GINGER-TAMARIND SAUCE---------------------------
           -Tamarind residue from above      1/2 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 c  -Boiling water                      1 tb Shredded fresh ginger
 
  Put the tamarind in a nonmetallic bowl.  Add 1/4 cup boiling water and let
  it soak for 30 minutes.  Mash the pulp and extract as much juice from it as
  possible.  Pour all liquid into a bowl, and save the fibrous residue for
  making the sauce.
  
  Slit the eggplants lengthwise to within 3/4 inch of the stem end so that
  each eggplant remains in one piece.
  
  Measure out the spices and place them right next to the stove in separate
  piles.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan or skillet over
  medium-high heat for 1 minute.  Add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Add
  the coriander, cinnamon, and cloves; fry for 15 more seconds. Stir in the
  coconut and cayenne pepper; continue frying, stirring, until lightly
  toasted (about 2 minutes).  Turn off the heat and stir in the salt,
  tamarind liquid, and molasses, and mix well.
  
  Stuff the eggplants with the spicy coconut mixture.  Secure them by
  wrapping thread around them.
  
  Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same pan over medium-high heat.
  When it is hot, add mustard seeds.  Keep a pot lid handy, as the seeds may
  spatter and fly all over.  When the seeds stop spattering, add the
  eggplants in one layer.  Fry the eggplants, turning them often, for 3 or 4
  minutes.  Reduce heat to medium or medium low and cook them, covered, for
  10 to 12 minutes or until they are soft and cooked through.  Turn off heat.
  Transfer them to a serving platter, pour Ginger-Tamarind sauce over them,
  and serve immediately.
  
  GINGER-TAMARIND SAUCE: Put tamarind residue in a nonmetallic bowl, add 1/2
  cup boiling water, and let soak for 30 minutes.  Mash the residue and
  extract as much tamarind essence as possible, squeezing it hard, into a
  bowl.  Discard the fibrous residue.
  
  Put tamarind water in a nonmetallic pan along with cornstarch, mix well and
  bring to a boil.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Turn off heat and stir in ginger
  shreds.
  
  Note: For a hotter flavor, stir 4 chopped hot green chilies into sauce.

      1 lb Tofu (fresh)                        1    Garlic clove; -OR-
    1/4 c  Whole wheat flour                   2 ts -Garlic powder
    1/4 c  Cornmeal                          1/4 ts Savory
    1/2 c  Wheat germ                        1/4 ts Powdered sage
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil                     1/2 ts Allspice
      2 tb Soy sauce                           2 ts Oregano
      1 ts Molasses                            2 ts Dijon mustard, more to taste
    1/2 ts Ground fennel                            -(or any prepared mustard)
 
  Mash tofu in a large bowl. Add remaining ingredients, mix well with fork or
  by hand. Pack into small oiled casserole dish; cover with two or three
  paper towels. Steam 25 to 35 minutes on a rack inside a covered pot with
  water on stove or in a pan of water in the oven at 375 degrees. Top will
  brown slightly. Cool before removing from dish. Steaming blends flavors.
  Stores up to two weeks in fridge. Makes 2.5 cups.
  
  JTK's notes: I accidently used wheat bran instead of germ, and it still
  worked (kind of dry, though). I made this in a 2-qt. porcelain souffle
  dish, which it filled approx. 2/3. I didn't have savory so I substituted
  fresh thyme. As usual, I added more garlic & hot sauce. Mash tofu very
  well, or you will have lots of tofu lumps --- I think I might try blending
  this in the food processor next time, to avoid this problem. This was
  enough for maybe 4 days of lunches for me (pate on 4-5 Wasa breads/rice
  cakes per day).

      Title: Spinach Cooked in a Bihari Style
 Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Fresh spinach                            -(very finely minced)
           - washed and trimmed              1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly grated fresh ginger         2 tb Very finely minced cilantro
      1    Garlic clove; mashed                2 tb Mustard oil
    1/2 ts Minced fresh hot green chili   
 
  This dish, traditionally made with mixed greens such as spinach and
  mustard, resembles an Italian pesto, though it is much thicker in
  consistency.  In place of olive oil, mustard oil is used, and apart from
  the taste of the greens themselves, the other strong flavors include raw
  garlic, raw ginger, green chilis, and cilantro.  If you can't obtain the
  pungent golden mustard oil which is called for in this recipe (available in
  Chinese as well as Indian groceries), steep 1/2 teaspoon powdered dried
  mustard in 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.
  
  In Northern India, this dish is eaten at room temperature for breakfast,
  along with fried bread and tea.  While raw garlic may seem alarming first
  thing in the morning, Indians consider it a medicinal necessity, and many
  swallow a crushed clove every day.
  
  DIRECTIONS: ========== Bring 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a large
  pot.  Add spinach and cook on high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until
  wilted.  Drain, rinse under cold water, and squeeze out as much liquid as
  you can easily.
  
  Put spinach in food processor or blender with 2 tablespoons water and blend
  until smooth.  This will result in a fairly thick paste.  Put in a serving
  bowl.
  
  Whisk together ginger, garlic, green chili, salt, cilantro, and oil.  Pour
  this dressing over the spinach and mix thoroughly.

      2 c  Dried broad beans                        Freshly ground black pepper
      1 c  Chopped spring onions             1/4 ts Hot chili pepper

  1 1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  Place beans in a bowl and cover well with cold water.  Leave to soak for 2
  days, changing water 2 or 3 times.
  
  Drain beans and remove skins by pressing each firmly with fingers.  Bean
  should pop out, otherwise tear skin with fingernail then squeeze.
  
  Pass cleaned beans through food grinder using fine screen.  Combine with
  spring onion, parsley, coriander, garlic, salt, peppers and soda.  Pass
  through grinder twice more, then knead to a paste.  Let mixture rest for 30
  minutes.
  
  With wet hands shape about a tablespoon of mixture at a time into thick
  patties about 4 cm (1-1/2 inches) in diameter.  Dip each side in sesame
  seeds if desired.  Place on a tray and leave at room temperature for 20
  minutes.
  
  Heat oil to 180C (350F) or until a cube of bread turns golden in 1
  minute.  Fry tameya a few at a time until deep golden brown, turning to
  brown evenly.  Each lot should take 5 minutes to cook.  Drain on paper
  towels.  Serve hot with flat bread such as Khoubiz, Salata Tahina and
  assorted salad vegetables, such as tomato, cucumber, sweet peppers and
  lettuce.
  
  Food processor method: Combine prepared ingredients and process in 2 lots
  using steel blade.  Mix well to evenly distribute flavours, rest mixture 30
  minute then fry as directed above.

  *Note: The book says to peel the cucumbers only if they are waxed and even
  then leave on a few strips.  I say to remove all the peel if it's been
  waxed.  Yuck.
  
  In a bowl, generously salt the sliced cucumbers.  Allow to sit for at least
  30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Combine the other ingredients.
  
  Squeeze out as much of the cucumber juice as you can, by wringing a handful
  at a time in a double layer of cheesecloth or a dish towel.  Twist until
  you can extract no more juice.
  
  Combine the squeezed cucumbers and the sauce in a serving bowl and
  refrigerate until ready to serve.

    1/2 ts Ground sage                         2 c  Cubed dry whole wheat bread
 
  This is a superb substitute for the traditional Thanksgiving turkey.  It's
  also good for other times of the year!  It's really the dressing that
  carries this dish.  The corn oil gives it that wonderful buttery taste that
  poultry dressing usually has.
  
  DIRECTIONS ========== Wash the tofu, pat it dry, and cut it into small
  pieces.  Put the tofu, arrowroot, soup base, salt, pepper, and agar flakes
  in a food processor and blend to a smooth paste. Oil and flour the loaf pan
  (or line it with baking liner paper after oiling). Spread a layer of tofu
  paste inside the pan, lining the bottom and all four sides. (Spread only a
  thin layer on the ends.) Use all but about 1 cup of the paste.
  
  Firmly but gently press the dressing into the pan, on top of the tofu paste
  "liner".  Try to avoid displacing the tofu.  Cover the dressing with the
  remaining tofu, carefully sealing the edges.  Cover the pan with foil,
  making certain the foil doesn't come in contact with the tofu.  (The tofu
  will eat into the foil.)
  
  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 F for 30 to 40 minutes.  Then remove the
  foil cover, glaze the top of the loaf with the dissolved barley malt syrup,
  turn the oven up to 450 F, and continue baking for 10 minutes. Remove from
  oven and allow the loaf to cool for about 10 minutes.  Unmold, slice, and
  serve hot with a sauce of your choice.
  
  SAGE DRESSING:  Saute onions, celery, carrots, and garlic in oil for 5
  minutes.  Add the sage, basil, soup base, salt and pepper, and continue
  cooking 5 minutes longer.
  
  Add the water and bring to a simmer.  Stir in the bread crumbs and cook for
  a few minutes.  Then remove from heat.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Firm tofu                           2 c  Sliced onions
           - cut into 1 in. squares            4 c  Sliced mushrooms
  1 1/2 c  Dry red wine                        4    Bay leaves
    1/4 c  Tamari                              1 ts Thyme
      4    Garlic cloves; pressed              1 ts Tarragon
           -Water as needed                    4 tb Whole wheat pastry flour
      2 tb Olive oil                      
 
  Place the pieces of tofu in a large, shallow dish.  Mix together the wine,
  tamari, and garlic.  Pour the mixture over the tofu, add water as need to
  cover it, and let it marinate for at least one hour.  If the tofu is going
  to marinate for more than an hour, place in the refrigerator.
  
  Place the marinated tofu on a well-oiled cookie sheet, reserving the
  marinade.  Bake at 375oF for 35-45 minutes or until crispy and brown. Turn
  the tofu over once during the baking so that it browns on both sides.
  
  While the tofu bakes, heat the oil in a large pan and slowly saute the
  onions.  When the onions are almost tender, add the mushrooms and the
  herbs.  Saute for a few minutes more.  Add the flour and mix well. Remove
  the pan from the heat and stir in a little of the marinade. Continue
  stirring until a paste is formed.  Return the pan to the heat and slowly
  add the remaining marinade, stirring constantly.  Add the baked tofu and
  simmer until thickened.
  
  Serve over pasta, rice or millet.

  1 1/2 ts Salt                               35 oz Canned Italian tomatoes
      1 ts Tumeric                           1/2 lb Firm silken tofu
    1/8 ts Cayenne pepper                  1 1/2 c  Green peas
      2 ts Ground coriander                         -(pref. fresh, OR frozen)

-------------------------------GARAM MARSALA-------------------------------
      5    3" cinnamon sticks                1/2 c  Whole cumin seeds
      1 c  Whole cardamom pods               1/2 c  Whole black peppercorns
    1/2 c  Whole cloves                      1/4 c  Coriander seeds
 
  Heat the oil in a saucepan.  Saute the onions, garlic, ginger, salt,
  tumeric, cayenne, coriander, cilantro, and garam marsala for about 5
  minutes.
  
  Drain the juice from the tomatoes into the sauteed vegetables.  Then crush
  the tomatoes by hand and add them to the vegetables.  Dice the tofu into
  1/2-inch cubes and add to the vegetables.  Continue to cook for 10 to 15
  minutes over low heat.  Then add the peas and cook another 4 minutes. Serve
  hot over brown rice.  A coriander coconut chutney (or other chutney) is an
  excellent accompaniment.
  
  GARAM MARSALA:  Preheat the oven to 200 F.  Place the ingredients on a
  baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes, or until the spices give off an
  aroma.  (Some chefs suggest roasting each ingredient separately, since each
  gives its characteristic aroma at a different time.)
  
  Separate the cardamom pods from the seeds.  Discard the pods.  Crush the
  cinnamon.  Combine the cinnamon, cardamom seeds, and other spices until the
  mixture is powdery.  Store in a sealed jar.

  boil uncovered to reduce.
  
  We LOVE this quick simple dish; sometimes I will substitute Zukes, or
  squash, or mushrooms for all or part of the tofu.   Enjoy.

  sandwiches beginning with a layer of grilled tofu, followed by arugula then

      Title: Tofu Ribs
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
-------------------------FORMATTED BY S. GRABOWSKI-------------------------
      1 lb Firm tofu                                BBQ sauce as needed
      2 tb Cold pressed oil                    1 c  Soy sauce (marinade)
      8    Bamboo skewers                 
 
  Slice tofu 1/2" thin, marinade in soy sauce minimum 8 hours in fridge.
  Pre-heat oven to 300F. Cut the marinated tofu slices lengthwise into 3
  strips per slice. Brush the tofu slices on all sides with oil and lay them,
  side by side, in a dish. The slices should not touch. Bake for 40 minutes.
  Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes.  Pass bamboo skewers
  carefully through the width of each slice.  Five to six slices will fit on
  one skewer without touching.  Cover with barbecue sauce and pre-heat the
  broiler. Broil 6 inches from the heat for about 5 minutes, turn over, and
  repeat. The tofu can become dark but scorching will make it bitter.

      Title: Tofu Whip
 Categories: Sauces, Desserts, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Firm or extra-firm tofu             1 tb Vanilla
           - drained & cut into chunks         1 tb Water, or more, optional
    1/4 c  Maple syrup                    
 
  It's light, fast, and a perfect complement to pies, puddings, and fruit
  compotes.  Tofu Whip can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week; if
  the mixture separates, blend it thoroughly before using.  The recipe may be
  cut in half.
  
  In a food processor or blender, blend all of the ingredients until very
  creamy, adding water if needed to achieve a whipped cream consistency.
  Refrigerate until needed.
  
  VARIATION: Instead of maple syrup, try 3 to 4 tablespoons of
  fruit-sweetened preserves and some finely minced citrus peel.  Choose the
  fruit and citrus flavors to complement the dessert.
  
  Makes about 2 cups

    1/3 c  Pine nuts                     

----------------------------TO FINISH AND SERVE----------------------------
           -Boiling, salted water                   Lemon wedges
           Olive oil                                Parsley sprigs
           Ground cinnamon or paprika     
 
  Serves: 8-12 Cooking time: 35 minutes
  
  Soak chick peas in the cold water for 24 hours, in a cool place if weather
  is warm.  Remove the skins by taking a handful at a time and rubbing with
  the palms of both hands so that the chick peas actually rub against one
  another.  Drop back into bowl and take up another lot.  Skim off the
  floating skins as they accumulate.  (Dang, why not just leave the skins ON,
  this sounds like too much trouble! -KM)  Drain well.
  
  Pass the skinned chick peas through food grinder twice, using fine screen.
  Alternatively, place in food processor container in 2 lots and process to a
  paste (NOW you're talking! -KM)
  
  Peel skin from boiled potatoes and mash finely with a fork.  Combine with
  ground chick peas, add salt and a good grinding of white pepper.  Blend
  thoroughly and keep aside.
  
  Put sliced onions in a pan with the water, cover and steam over medium heat
  for 10 minutes, then remove cover and leave until moisture evaporates. Turn
  into a bowl and cool.
  
  Add allspice, cumin, pine nuts, and currants to the onion.  Blend well,
  then mix in tahina, and salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Take 4 pieces of unbleached calico or similar cloth, each about 50 cm (20
  inches) square and scald in boiling water.  Cool a little, then wring out
  well.
  
  Open out a square of cloth on work surface and put a quarter of the chick
  pea paste in the centre.  Spread evenly with a spatula to a 20 cm (8 inch)
  square and place a quarter of the filling in the centre, spreading it a
  little.
  
  Bring each corner of the paste over the filling by lifting up corners of
  cloth.  Paste should enclose filling in envelope fashion.  Smooth joins to
  seal well.
  
  Make a single tie with each pair of diagonally opposite corners of cloth,
  then tie a second time.  Complete another 3 topigs in the same way.
  
  Half fill a large pot with water, bring to the boil and add about 1
  tablespoon salt. When briskly boiling, lower prepared topigs into pot and
  return to the boil.  Cover and boil steadily for 12-15 minutes or until
  topigs float and feel firm to the touch.
  
  Lift out immediately and place on a tray, draining off water in tray.
  
  Untie and invert topigs onto platter.  Leave until cool.
  
  When ready to serve, pour a little olive oil over each topig and dust
  lightly with cinnamon or paprika.  Garnish platter with lemon wedges and
  parsley.  To serve, cut each topig in half, then slice in thick pieces.
  Olive oil and lemon juice are added to individual taste.
  
  NOTE: Ready-skinned chick peas are available at some Armenian and Greek
  food stores.  These look like split peas, but are larger and nut coloured.

  Each of the three grain combinations can be formed using timbales or other
  molds, or by the quenelle method using two large tablespoons.
  
  COUSCOUS, RICE AND QUINOA:  Heat all couscous ingredients in a double
  boiler until warmed through.  Pack mixture into 6 small timbale molds (or
  scoop mixture in a tablespoon, round a second tablespoon over the mixture
  and press spoons together).  Unmold mixture and set aside.
  
  Repeat procedure with basmati rice ingredients; set aside.
  
  Repeat with quinoa ingredients; set aside.
  
  COULIS:  Grill, broil or roast corn in their husks for 10 to 12 minutes,
  until corn is cooked.  Discard husks and remove kernels from cobs.  In a
  food processor blend kernels with enough water to produce a sauce.  Pass
  mixture through a fine strainer, and season the liquid with salt and
  pepper.
  
  TO SERVE:  Pour coulis on 6 plates and place one serving of each grain on
  each plate.  Garnish couscous with fried sage leaves; garnish basmati rice
  with fried zucchini.
  
  NOTES: To make tomato concasse, peel, seed and dice tomatoes and toss with
  olive oil, salt and pepper.
  
  To make shiitake duxelles, finely mince mushrooms and saute in oil with a
  pinch of minced shallot or onion.
  
  To fry sage leaves and zucchini for the garnishes, heat 3/4 inch of oil in
  a pan to 350 F (a drop of water should ripple and pop on surface of the
  oil); fry sage leaves for 1 minute, remove to a paper towel and
  drain.	Repeat with finely julienned zucchini, frying just until golden.

      Title: Tuscan Bread
 Categories: Breads, Italian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 oz Fresh yeast; -=OR=-             2 1/4 c  Unbleached white flour
      2 pk -Instant dry yeast granules       1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/4 c  Warm water (125F)              
 
  IN A LARGE BOWL, DISSOLVE the yeast in the water. Mix the 2 flours and stir
  them in to make a soft dough. Knead 10 minutes by hand, or 4 minutes in a
  heavy duty mixer with a dough hook. Oil a clean bowl and set the dough in
  it, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk. (In
  the traditional warm place, this will take about 2 hours. However, a cooler
  temperature will do as long as the dough has enough time to rise, including
  overnight in the refrigerator.) If the dough is ready sooner than it is
  needed, punch it down and refrigerate it or let it rise slowly again at
  room temperature until ready to use. Rub 2 to 3 tablespoons flour into a
  lintless dish towel and set the towel on a baking sheet. When the dough has
  completed its rising, punch it down, turn it out onto a floured work
  surface, and flatten it into an oblong about 8 inches wide, 10 inches long,
  and 1/4-inch thick. It will still be very soft, but try to use a minimum of
  additional flour in handling it. Roll the dough tight, jelly-roll fashion,
  into a cylindrical shape. Flatten this to about 1-inch thick and roll it
  again. (This activates the web of gluten that will keep the loaf from
  flattening out in the oven.) FOR A ROUND LOAF, tuck both ends of the
  cylinder under to meet in the center, pinching to seal them. Roll the dough
  around the work surface under your hands, to shape it into a smooth ball
  about 5 inches in diameter. FOR AN OBLONG LOAF, roll the dough under your
  hands into a fat cigar shape, extending it to about 10 inches in length.
  Set the loaf on the floured towel and fold the ends of the towel loosely
  around it. Put the covered loaf, on its baking sheet, in a warm place to
  rise for 1 hour. Preheat an oven lined with baking tiles to 400F. Have a
  water-filled sprayer handy. Slide your hand under the towel, pick up the
  loaf, and gently deposit it upside down on the tiles. Spray water into the
  oven before closing the door, and spray twice more at 2-minute intervals.
  Bake for 50 minutes or until golden brown. The bread should have a hollow
  sound when you knock on its bottom.

 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      9    Lasagne noodles                   1/2 ts Salt
           -(OR as much as needed)             1 ts Thyme
      1 lb Tofu                                1 ts Basil
    1/2 c  Tomato paste (or sauce)             3 tb Canola oil
      1    -to:                                3 sm Onions; -OR-
      2 c  Tomato sauce                        1 lb Mushrooms
           -(as much as desired)               3    Celery stalks
      1 bn Chard (or spinach)              1 1/2 c  Cauliflower
      3 tb Nutritional yeast              
 
  Mash up the tofu in a bowl and add salt, nutritional yeast, spices, tomato
  paste.  Chop the celery, caulflower, and onion finely and saute in oil.
  When mostly cooked add the mushrooms, sliced.  When the mushrooms are done,
  add the vegetables to the tofu and mix well.
  
  Cook the lasagne noodles in water until done.  This can be done beforehand
  to save time.  Grease your casserole pan lightly with some oil to help
  prevent sticking.  Place a layer of noodles down and spoon some tomato
  sauce over it.  Put a layer of tofu/veggies down.
  
  Saute the chard (or spinach) in a pan with just a little bit of oil. When
  completely cooked down and soft, add half to the lasagne, spreading evenly
  over the layer.  Add more sauce then noodles, then tofu than another layer
  of chard.  Top with more sauce, more noodles and a large amount of sauce
  (to prevent any burning or drying out of the noodles when they're cooked).
  Preheat oven to about 350 or 375 and cook roughly 35 minutes, or until
  bubbly and hot.  SERVE!  I guarantee it'll be among the best lasagne you've
  ever had....

 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian, Chinese
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 oz Cellophane noodles                       - drained and chopped
           - soaked in warm water for          1 c  Bean sprouts

           - chopped fine                           - cut into 1 inch sections

           - finely chopped                    1    White part of leek; chopped
      3 sm Potatoes; peeled and                1 ds Black pepper
           - cut paper thin with a            10    Dried rice papers
           - peeler and then shredded               - (banh trang)
      1 tb Tree ears; soaked in                2 c  Peanut oil
           - warm water 20 min,           
 
  ~- Combine all ingredients except rice papers and oil.  Cut the rice papers
  into quarters.  Wet the surface of each paper with water (use your fingers
  or a brush) and within about 1 min the paper will become flexible enough to
  be filled.  Place about 1 tbsp of the filling on each paper and roll. Heat
  the oil in a wok to about 350 deg. F. Place rolls, flaps-down, into oil and
  cook 20 min (10 min each side), until completely done.
  
   Serve with Buddhist Nuoc Leo.
  
  ~- Disclaimer: This recipe is fat-city.  There is another form of spring
  roll skin which is inherently sticky and stretchy (white and barely
  opaque), and doesn't require deep frying. (One could lighly saute the
  carrots and potatoes beforehand.) I can't remember what this wrapper is
  called.  BTW - With this alternate type of "spring roll" fresh chinese
  parsley or cilantro is often included.

      Title: Vegetable Gumbo
 Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Low-cal
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Onion, chopped                    1/2 c  White Grape Juice
    1/2    Green pepper, diced               1/2 c  Water
      2    Ribs Celery, diced                1/4 ts Tabasco sauce
      1    Garlic clove; minced              1/4 ts Paprika
      1 lb Okra, sliced, fresh, frozen         2 tb Fresh chopped parsley
      1 lb Tomatoes, fresh, or canned          1 tb Basil or Rosemary, minced
      2 c  Corn, fresh, frozen, canned              Vegetable coating spray
      1 ts Vegetable Bouillon granules    
 
  Method: In a large heavy stew pot, place bouillon and 1/2 C white grape
  juice, onion, green pepper, celery garlic, cook until tender, 5-7 minutes.
  Add other ingredients, cook over low heat, stirring occasionally to keep
  from sticking to bottom. Cover and simmer gently until corn and okra are
  done. (or simmer in crockpot 6-7 hours)
  
  Note:  Cut fresh corn from cob with a sharp knife, then scrape the
  remaining corn off the cob.  Four ears will make about two cups. If you use
  dried herbs, rub them with the palms of your hands before adding to the
  pot, this releases their aroma and goodness.

 Categories: Vegetarian, India
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 c  Whole mung bean                     1 ts Peeled, minced ginger
           -- picked over and washed         1/3 lb String beans; trimmed
      2 c  Long-grain rice                          -- and cut into 1/4" pieces
  4 1/2 tb Vegetable oil                       2 ts Garam masala
      1 ts Whole black mustard seeds       1 1/2 ts Ground coriander
      1 md Onion                           2 1/2 ts Salt
           -- peeled and finely chopped        2 tb Finely minced parsley
      4 md Garlic cloves                            -- preferably Chinese
           -- peeled and finely minced    
 
  Put mung beans in a bowl with 3 cups water.  Cover lightly and set aside
  for 12 hours.  Drain beans and wrap in a very damp dish towel.  Put the
  wrapped bundle in a bowl.  Put this bowl in a dark place (like an unused
  oven) for 24 hours.
  
  Wash rice well and soak in 4 cups of water for half an hour.  Drain well.
  
  Preheat oven to 325 F.
  
  Heat oil in a wide, heavy, 4- to 5-quart ovenproof pot over a medium-high
  flame.  When hot, put in mustard seeds.  As soon as the mustard seeds begin
  to pop (this takes just a few seconds), put in the onion.  Stir and fry for
  about 5 minutes or until onion turns brown at the edges.  Add the garlic
  and ginger.  Fry, stirring, for about 1 minute.  Turn heat to medium-low
  and add the mung beans, rice, string beans, mushrooms, garam masala, ground
  coriander, and salt.  Stir and saute for about 10 minutes or until rice
  turns translucent and vegetables are well coated with oil. Add 4 cups hot
  water and the minced parsley.  Turn heat to a medium-high flame and cook,
  stirring, for about 5 minutes or until most of the water is absorbed.
  (There will be an inch or so of water at the bottom.)  Cover the pot first
  with aluminum foil, crimping and sealing the edges, and then with its own
  lid.  Place in heated oven for half an hour.  Fluff up with a fork and
  serve.

 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/4 c  Olive oil                                - cut into thin shreds
  1 1/4 c  Long-grain brown rice                    Salt
      1 lg Onion; peeled and sliced                 Freshly ground black pepper
      2 lg Garlic cloves; crushed              1 lb Washed and trimmed leeks
      1 pn Saffron strands                          - cut into 1-inch lengths
      3 c  Light Vegetable Stock             1/4 c  Frozen peas
           -(generous measure) OR water      1/4 c  Black olives, or more
    1/2    Lemon; thinly pared rind,     

---------------------------------TO GARNISH---------------------------------
           Parsley; chopped               
 
  Heat the oil in a large, deep pan.  Add the long-grain brown rice and onion
  slices and stir until the rice is coated and begins to turn opaque. Add the
  garlic, saffron, stock or wate, lemon rind and salt and pepper. Mix well,
  then bring to a boil.  Mix again, to distribute the saffron coloring.
  
  Arrange the vegetables and olives attractively on top of the rice. Bring to
  a boil.  Cover with a lid or foil and simmer for 45 minutes.
  
  Sprinkle with parsley and serve straight from the pan.
  
  May be served with blanched almonds, slivered Brazil nuts or whole cashew
  nuts- separately, in a bowl - for people to help themselves to if they
  like.
  
  Variation: VEGETARIAN PAELLA WITH ARTICHOKES: Use 4 to 6 globe artichokes
  instead of the leeks.  Very tender baby artichokes can simply be quartered;
  otherwise cut the leaves and choke from the artichokes, then halve or
  quarter the artichoke bottoms.  Garnish with artichoke leaves.

      Title: Wild Rice and Hazelnut Salad
 Categories: Salads, Vegetarian, Rice/grains
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    3/4 c  Wild rice                                - (See RECIPE)
    1/2 ts Salt                                1 sm Fennel bulb
    1/2 c  Hazelnuts                                - cut into small squares
      5 tb Currants                            1    Crisp apple
      1 lg Orange, juice only                       Freshly ground black pepper
           Citrus Vinaigrette                       Salt
           - with Hazelnut Oil            
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Rinse the wild rice, and soak it in water for a half
  hour, then drain. Add 4 cups fresh water and salt, and bring to a boil.
  Cook, covered, at a simmer until the grains are swollen and tender, but
  still chewy, about 30 to 35 minutes. Pour the cooked rice into a colander
  and let it drain briefly. While the rice is cooking, toast the hazelnuts in
  the oven, 7 to 10 minutes, or until they smell toasty. Let them cool a few
  minutes; then rub them in a small kitchen towel to remove most of the
  skins. Don't worry about any flecks of skins that won't come off. Roughly
  chop the hazelnuts, leaving the pieces fairly large. Rinse the currants in
  warm water and squeeze them dry; then cover them with the orange juice and
  let them soak until needed. Prepare the vinaigrette. Add the soaked
  currants and the fennel to the warm rice, and toss with the dressing. Just
  before serving, cut the apple into small pieces, add it to the rice, along
  with the hazelnuts, and toss. Season with freshly ground black pepper, and
  additional salt, if needed, and serve.

      Title: Wild Rice with Chestnuts
 Categories: Vegetarian, Rice/grains
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 tb Oil                               1/4 c  Dried currants
      5 md Shallots                            2 ts Aniseed
           - peeled and finely chopped       1/4 ts Sea salt; or to taste
      2    Celery ribs; finely chopped         4 c  Water
      1 c  Wild rice; rinsed                   1 ts Finely chopped orange zest
    1/3 c  Dried, peeled chestnuts                  -OR- grated
 
  PRESSURE COOKER: Heat the oil in the cooker.  Add the shallots and celery
  and cook, stirring frequently, until softened slightly, about 1 minute.
  Stir in the rice, chestnuts, currants, aniseed, salt, and water.
  
  Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.  Lower the
  heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 25 minutes. Allow
  the pressure to come down naturally or use a quick release method. Remove
  the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. If
  the rice or chestnuts are not quite cooked, return to high pressure for a
  few minutes.
  
  Drain (reserving the liquid for stock) and return to the pot.  Cover and
  let steam over low heat for a few minutes to dry out.  Fluff up as you stir
  in the orange peel.  Break up chestnuts into 2 to 3 pieces with a fork, if
  desired.
  
  STANDARD STOVETOP: Soak the chestnuts overnight.  Drain and reserve the
  water.  In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil.  Add the shallots and
  celery and saute for 1 minute.  Add the chestnut soaking liqiud plus enough
  water to equal 3 cups and bring to a boil.  Stir in the rice, reserved
  chestnuts, currants, aniseed, and salt.  Return to the boil, cover, reduce
  heat, and simmer until most of the grains have butterflied and almost all
  the liquid has been absorbed, about 50 minutes.  Let stand, covered, off
  heat for 10 minutes.  If there is still liquid left in the bottom of the
  pot, lift out the rice with a slotted spoon.

      1 ts Salt                          

----------------------------------STUFFING----------------------------------
    3/4 c  Wild rice, uncooked               1/2    Oyster mushrooms
  2 3/4 c  Stock                                    -OR- chanrerelles mushrooms
    1/4 md Onion; minced                            -If using oysters, separate
      2 sm Stalks celery; sliced thin               -them into small clumps,
      2 tb Unrefined corn oil                       -if using chanterelles,
    3/4 md Onion; chopped coarse                    -halve them
    1/4 lb Button mushrooms                    1 lg Tomato; chopped
           - sliced thick                    1/2 ts Powdered sage
      6    Shiitake                            1 pn Powdered thyme
           - fresh or reconstitued,            1 tb Shoyu
           - quartered or eighthed                  Salt and pepper; to taste

-----------------------------NUTTY ALMOND SAUCE-----------------------------
      3 tb Unrefined corn oil                1/4 md Onion; separated into leaves
           -OR- soy margarine                  4    Cloves
      4 tb Unbleached flour                         White pepper; to taste
  2 1/2 c  Soy milk; heated                    3 ds Freshly grated nutmeg
    1/2 c  Almonds                                  Salt; to taste
 
  FOR CREPES: Blend the egg replacer w/1/2C water until smooth.  Add
  remaining ingredients and blend one minute at high speed.
  
  Heat a crepe pan or non stick 8" skillet over low heat, brush the bottom
  lightly w/oil (I use unrefined corn oil).  When pan is heated, take it off
  the burner, let cool about three seconds and pour 3-4T batter into it.
  Swirl the pan so the bottom is coated w/a thin layer of batter.  Put the
  pan back on the burner and cook until lightly browned.  Flip the crepe and
  cook until that side is lightly browned as well.  Repeat w/remaining
  batter.  This makes about a dozen crepes.  Note that you will inevitably
  screw up the first crepe or two, but it will become fairly routine after
  that.  Don't worry about it, I still do that after all these years.
  
  FOR STUFFING: Saute the onion in a little dry white wine for a minute or
  two, then add wild rice and stock, cover tightly, bring to a boil, turn
  heat to low and cook about an hour, until all liquid is absorbed.
  
  While the rice cooks, saute celery in oil until slightly tender, add onions
  and all mushrooms, and saute until all vegs are medium tender. Add cooked
  rice, tomato and seasoning and cook another ten minutes or so. Fill crepes
  w/the mixture, roll them over it and heat in a preheated oven at 350 for
  about ten minutes.
  
  Serve w/Nutty Almond Sauce and garnish w/parsley and a twisted orange
  slice.
  
  FOR NUTTY ALMOND SAUCE: Toast almonds until golden, then pulverize. (Don't
  overgrind or you'll get almond butter.)
  
  Heat oil a few minutes in a heavy bottomed skillet, then stir in flour and
  cook 2-3 minutes on low, until fragrant.  Stir in soy milk and continue to
  stir until it begins to thicken, then stir in seasonings. Cover and cook 10
  more minutes, but stir often to prevent scorching. Stir in almonds and cook
  another 4-5 minutes.
  
  Serve w/a simple spinach salad w/mustard vinaigrette and French bread,
  along w/a chilled white wine.

  pull the top corner down to the bottom, folding the wrapper over the
  filling to make a triangle.  Press edges firmly to make a seal.  Bring left
  & right corners together above the filling.  Overlap the tips of these
  corners, moisten with water & press together.  Place completed wrapper on
  the corn-starch platter & continue till all wrappers are used.
  
  FOR SOUP: Drop wontons into boiling water & cook for 5 minutes.  Drain.

  batches till golden, 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  Drain.  Serve with
  dipping sauce or duck sauce.
  
  Uncooked wontons will keep in the freezer for a good 2 months if well
  wrapped.  Thaw before frying, but they can be boiled straight from frozen &
  cooked 2 minutes longer.

      Title: Zesty Green Split Peas
 Categories: Vegetarian, Low-cal, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Green split peas;uncooked           2 ts Ginger; peeled & minced
      8 c  -Water                              2 ts Jalapenos; seeded & chopped
      2    Bay leaves                          4 tb Black mustard seeds; ground*
    1/2 ts Ground tumeric                      3 tb -Water
      1 ts Salt                                3 oz Coconut, shredded sweetened
      2 tb Canola oil;(I used 2 Tsp)           1 pn Soy margarine (optional)

--------------------------------FOR GARNISH--------------------------------
           Cilantro, chopped (optional)   
 
  *If black mustard seeds are not available, use 1 Tbs dry mustard.
  
  Mix ground mustard powder in with water and allow to sit for 30 minutes.
  
  Bring split peas and water to a boil.  Lower heat to medium. Add bay leaves
  and tumeric (I forgot the tumeric--was good anyway). Simmer, covered, until
  peas are done, 40 to 45 minutes.  (When pressed between the thumb and the
  index finger, they break easily.) While simmering, uncover occasionally and
  stir, adding a Tbs or so of hot water if the mixture sticks to the bottom
  of the pan.  When cooked, remove and discard bay leaves. Add salt and keep
  warm.  Heat oil in a small, 6-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Saute
  ginger root and jalape o until ginger is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.
  Add mustard paste and cook for another minute, stirring constantly. Add
  coconut and stir several times. Remove from heat. Pour over the pea mixture
  and stir. (I had to drain my peas, because I still had lots of water in
  mine.)  Let stand covered for 15 minutes. Add a dab of soy margarine if
  desired and garnish with cilantro. (I didn't use the cilantro)
  
  I think this would make a good filling for pita pockets. I didn't think the
  peas were "zesty" enough, so I sprinkled hot pepper vinegar on mine.

           -thick                              2 tb Dill weed, ground
           Juice of 1/2 lemon             
 
  This recipe is really simple. Rinse the salmon well, and place in a glass
  bowl. Juice the lemon over the fish and refrigerate for one half hour or
  so. Meanwhile, melt the butter or margarine and add the dill weed.
  
  Prepare a hot BBQ fire (or preheat oven to 400F), and grease the rack with
  non-stick spray (or prepare a baking dish in the same manner).
  
  Rinse the salmon again, and cover liberally with dill-butter mix and bake
  for 20 min. or grill. If you grill, usually grill 4 min. per side.

  Chenin Blanc, two candles, and a smile!"
