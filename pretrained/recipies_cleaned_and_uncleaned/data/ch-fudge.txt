Absolutely Deep Dark Chocolate Fudge Biscuits

cookies

7 1/2 oz all-purpose flour
2 oz cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
8 oz chocolate; broken in 16 pcs
4 oz unsweetened chocolate; broken in 8 pcs
12 oz light brown sugar
6 oz unsalted butter
3  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 lb chocolate chips

Recipe by: Paul Vincent <KNDUSR18@MSMAIL-GATEWAY.UNIVERSITY-CENTRAL- EN
[Note: Instead of the unsweetened chocolate, I just used an extra 4ozs of
plain chocolate, and got perfect results. I think as long as you're using
*really* good plain chocolate, say at least 55% cocoa solids, it doesn't
really matter!]

Preheat the oven to 325F / 170C / Gas 3.

Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt. Set
aside.

Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
heat. Place the plain and the unsweetened chocolates in the top half of the
double boiler. Tightly cover the top with cling film and allow to heat for
12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Keep at room
temperature until needed.

Place the soft light brown sugar and butter in the bowl of an electric
mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on medium for 1 minute. Scrape down the
bowl and beat on high for an additional 30 seconds. Scrape down the bowl.
Add the eggs, one at a time, while beating on medium, and stopping to
scrape down the bowl after incorporating each addition. Add the vanilla
essence and beat on medium for 30 seconds. Add the melted chocolate and
beat on low for 10 seconds more. Scrape down the bowl and beat for an
additional 30 seconds. Add the sifted flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of
soda, and salt, and the chocolate chips, and beat on low until thoroughly
combined - about 20 to 30 seconds. Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix
thoroughly with a rubber spatula.

Portion 6 to 8 biscuits per baking sheet by dropping 2 level tablespoons of
batter per biscuit onto each of 2 non-stick baking sheets. Place the
biscuits on the top and middle shelves of the preheated oven and bake for
18 to 22 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to bottom about halfway
through the baking time. Allow the biscuits to cool for 5 to 6 minutes on
the baking sheets. Transfer the biscuits to a cooling rack to thoroughly
cool before storing in a sealed plastic container. Repeat this procedure
until all the biscuits have been baked.

Makes 3 to 3.5 dozen biscuits

Angel Fudge

chocolate, brownies, nuts

2 cup sugar
8 tablespoon hershey's® chocolate syrup
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 small can marshmallow whip

Recipe by: Hershey's 'Recipe Book', 1930
Place the sugar, chocolate syrup and milk in a deep kettle and
stir until the ingredients are well blended.  Boil without
stirring until the mixture will form a soft ball when dropped
into cold water.  Remove from fire and add the butter, vanilla,
and marshmallow whip and allow to stand until the mixture has
cooled to lukewarm.   Then beat until creamy and pour into
buttered tins.  Cut into squares.

That's it!  No reference to size of "tins."  I suppose
marshmallow whip would be equivalent to marshmallow topping. . .

Source: The Waffle Cookbook by Freiberger

Preheat waffle iron. Preheat oven to 250=F8F (120=F8C). In a small,
heavy saucepan or double boiler melt chocolate and butter over low
heat.

In a medium-size bowl sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda,

yolks, milk, sour cream and vanilla. Gradually stir in flour mixture
and melted chocolate and butter. Beat until smooth. Stir in walnuts.
In a small bowl whip egg whites until soft peaks are formed. Fold
into batter. Batter will be thick. Lightly brush hot grids with
shortening or oil. Pour enough batter to fill two-thirds of the
waffle iron. Push batter out to the edges with a wooden spoon. Cook
until crisp and a dark rich brown. Be careful not to overcook. Keep
finished waffles warm in the oven on a rack until ready to serve.
Repeat with the remaining batter.

To serve cut waffles into quarter sections. Sprinkle powdered sugar
through a fine sieve over the top.

Chocolate Fudge Icing

cakes, toppings

1 cup minus 1 tbsp rich milk
1  remove from heat and stir in until; dissolved:
2 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 oz grated chocolate

This icing recipe is a candy recipe with milk added to make it into
frosting.

Bring to a boil in a large heavy pan: Bring t a boil and cook covered
2-3 minutes until the steam washes down from the sides of the pan any
crystals which may have formed. Uncover, redice heat and cook without
stirring to soft-ball stage, 238 degrees. When nearing 238, there is
a fine overall bubbling with, simultaneously, a coarser patter, as
though the fine bubbled areas were being pulled down for quilting
into the coarser ones. Remove from heat without jostling or stirring.
Cool the candy to 110. You may hasten this process by placing the hot
pan in a larger pan of cold water until the bottom of the pan has
cooled.  Add: 2 4 TBSP butter Beat fudge partially.  Add: 1 tsp
vanilla Then beat until it begins to lose its sheen. At this point
the drip from the spoon, when you flip it over, holds its shape
against the bottom of the spoon. Quickly add: 1/2 1 c. broken nut
meats Pour the fudge into a buttered pan. Cut into squares before it
hardens. To use fudge for centers, beat until thick, knead and shape.

Chocolate-Cinnamon Torte With Mocha Fudge Gla

cakes, deserts, vegatarian, vegetarian, baking

      ----CAKE----
8 oz tofu
2 cup granular sweetener - (such as sucan; at)
3/4 cup oil
1 cup water
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
      ----MOCHA FUDGE GLAZE----
1/4 cup margarine or oil
1/4 cup cocoa powder
3 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon instant espresso powder
1 1/2 cup granular sweetener
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  ground cinnamon for garnish

For CAKE: Preheat oven to 350 F.  Oil a 10- or 12-inch springform
pan; dust lightly with a bit of cocoa powder.

Using electric mixer, blend tofu with sweetener on low speed until
mixture is paste-like.  Increase speed and beat until tofu is
thoroughly blended and mixture is shiny and the consistency of thick
syrup. (Don't worry about undissolved granules of sweetener which may
remain; they will dissolve later on when the liquids are added.)

Add oil, water and vanilla to tofu mixture, beating until thoroughly
combined.  Sift together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, cream of
tartar, and cocoa powder. Blend sifted dry ingredients into liquid
mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake until tester inserted
in center comes out clean, about 40-50 minutes. Transfer to rack and
cool completely.

GLAZE: In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients. Cook and stir
over medium heat until mixture is shiny and completely smooth. Let
mixture come to a boil, then immediately remove from heat. Let cool
10 minutes. Stir vigorously before using.

To assemble cake:  Remove sides from pan.  If necessary, slice off
top of cake to make surface even, then invert cake on rack set over a
pan to catch drips of excess glaze. Remove pan bottom from cake. Pour
glaze evenly over top of cake, allowing some to drip down sides also.
Use a knife or spatula to spread glaze around sides. Transfer to
serving platter. Decorate by sprinkling additional ground cinnamon
over cake, using stencils to create shapes or a pattern if desired.

Variation: A mixture of chopped toasted nuts and ground cinnamon may
be pressed onto sides of freshly glazed cake instead of sprinkling
plain cinnamon over top.

Jocelyn's Chocolate Fudge Bars (Fudge Mint Co

chocolate, mint, bars

1  stick butter
2 oz unsweetened baking chocolate
1  squares
1 cup sugar
2  eggs
1 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon vanilla or peppermint
1  extract
1 cup chocolate chips
      Glaze------
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon milk -- or more
1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract

Melt the butter and the unsweetened chocolate. (You can put them in a
stainless steel bowl and stick it in the oven while it's preheating. )

When the bowl is cool, add the sugar, beat in the eggs, mix in the
flour, the salt, and the baking soda. Add the vanilla. Spread into a
greased jellyroll pan (that is, 11x17). It won't be trivial; you'll
have to use a knife or something to spread it smoothly into all four
corners.

Sprinkle with the chocolate chips, and bake at 350 F for 8 minutes or
so. ("Bake until done.  " When they're done, they pull away from the
pan just a little bit and have a dull glossy look to them.  )

Glaze: Mix up the ingredients. It should be like a glaze that will
pour, thickly. Add a couple of drops of food coloring if desired.
When the cookies come out of the oven, spread the glaze. Cool
slightly, and cut while still warm. (If you wait too long, the glaze
will crack when you try to cut the cookies.  )

Notes: You can skip the glaze, if you like. (For example, you might
not want peppermint cookies, or you might want to use those miniature
baking M&M's.  ) If you don't glaze them but still want peppermint
chocolate cookies, use the peppermint instead of the vanilla. (Or in
addition to it, for a slightly different flavor but still good. )

This is Mom's recipe. It was quick and easy enough that she could
make up a batch of cookies while getting breakfast on the table, when
one of us four kids piped up and said "By the way, it's my turn to
bring cookies today. "

She also has an anecdote about one of our schoolkids being allergic to
oranges, so she made a batch with orange food coloring so he could
have something orange anyway. You could try the same trick for
Halloween cookies...

If you don't want them to be thin bar cookies, then use a smaller pan
(9x13 or 9x9) and bake them longer.

Okay, here's the "horror story" part. I got the recipe from my mom the
other day, and decided to make them up (sans mint & glaze) that
night. I'd been reorganizing the kitchen lately, and had a bunch of
plastic canisters for all of my staples, but hadn't labeled
everything yet. I thought I had the flour.  Well, it certainly wasn't
sugar, and I knew it wasn't the Krusteaz Deluxe Basic Cookie Mix, so
it had to be the flour, so I used it. There was something a little
odd about it - but I've got unbleached flour, whole wheat flour,
graham flour, and cake flour, so I figured it had to be one of the
odd ones.

It wasn't.  There was something grainy and a bit of an odd flavor to
the cookies.  Can you say "Masa Harina"? I'd used corn instead of
wheat flour!

My next door neighbor Selene, and my SO's daughter Maria, and her
little friend Devin like them, but nobody else will eat them.

I tried the recipe again tonight.  I made the plain batch, no mint or
mint glaze, and used mini-M&M's instead of the chocolate chips. I've
tried them - they're perfect in every way - and if I just imagine
them with peppermint, they're exactly as I remember them.

A final footnote: I am quite serious about working to spread them all
the way to the corners.  It'll be a thick batter, so just keep at it;
it'll make a thin layer. That's a good thing, because it means they
cook fast, so don't give up.

[P.  S. At least that's how they turn out (thick and hard to spread
into the corners) when I make them, using the mixer. Your mileage may
vary, especially if you're using margarine.

Jocelyn's Chocolate Fudge Bars (Fudge Mint Cookies)

beverages, eggs, spreads, sauces, spices

1  butter
2 oz unsweetened baking c hocolate squar; es
1 cup sugar
2  eggs
1 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon vanilla or peppermint extract
      Chocolate chips -----glaze------
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon milk; or more
1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract

Recipe by: "C. Baden" <hazel@NETCOM.COM> Melt the butter and the
unsweetened chocolate. (You can put them in a stainless steel bowl and
stick it in the oven while it's preheating.)

When the bowl is cool, add the sugar, beat in the eggs, mix in the flour,
the salt, and the baking soda. Add the vanilla. Spread into a greased
jellyroll pan (that is, 11x17). It won't be trivial; you'll have to use a
knife or something to spread it smoothly into all four corners.

Sprinkle with the chocolate chips, and bake at 350 F for 8 minutes or so.
("Bake until done." When they're done, they pull away from the pan just a
little bit and have a dull glossy look to them.)

Glaze: Mix up the ingredients. It should be like a glaze that will pour,
thickly. Add a couple of drops of food coloring if desired. When the
cookies come out of the oven, spread the glaze. Cool slightly, and cut
while still warm. (If you wait too long, the glaze will crack when you try
to cut the cookies.)

Notes: You can skip the glaze, if you like. (For example, you might not
want peppermint cookies, or you might want to use those miniature baking
M&M's.) If you don't glaze them but still want peppermint chocolate
cookies, use the peppermint instead of the vanilla. (Or in addition to it,
for a slightly different flavor but still good.)

This is Mom's recipe. It was quick and easy enough that she could make up a
batch of cookies while getting breakfast on the table, when one of us four
kids piped up and said "By the way, it's my turn to bring cookies today."

She also has an anecdote about one of our schoolkids being allergic to
oranges, so she made a batch with orange food coloring so he could have
something orange anyway. You could try the same trick for Halloween
cookies...

If you don't want them to be thin bar cookies, then use a smaller pan (9x13
or 9x9) and bake them longer.

Okay, here's the "horror story" part. I got the recipe from my mom the
other day, and decided to make them up (sans mint & glaze) that night. I'd
been reorganizing the kitchen lately, and had a bunch of plastic canisters
for all of my staples, but hadn't labeled everything yet.  I thought I had
the flour.  Well, it certainly wasn't sugar, and I knew it wasn't the
Krusteaz Deluxe Basic Cookie Mix, so it had to be the flour, so I used it.
There was something a little odd about it - but I've got unbleached flour,
whole wheat flour, graham flour, and cake flour, so I figured it had to be
one of the odd ones.

It wasn't.  There was something grainy and a bit of an odd flavor to the
cookies.  Can you say "Masa Harina"?  I'd used corn instead of wheat flour!

My next door neighbor Selene, and my SO's daughter Maria, and her little
friend Devin like them, but nobody else will eat them.

I tried the recipe again tonight.  I made the plain batch, no mint or mint
glaze, and used mini-M&M's instead of the chocolate chips.  I've tried them
~ they're perfect in every way - and if I just imagine them with
peppermint, they're exactly as I remember them.

A final footnote: I am quite serious about working to spread them all the
way to the corners.  It'll be a thick batter, so just keep at it; it'll
make a thin layer.  That's a good thing, because it means they cook fast,
so don't give up.

[P.S. At least that's how they turn out (thick and hard to spread into the
corners) when I make them, using the mixer.  Your mileage may vary,
especially if you're using margarine.

Makes one Generous Quart. Note: "New York Super Fudge Chunk was
developed as a regional flavor for the sophisticated New York palate.
After coming up with several variations in our Burlington lab,we
packed the samples in dry ice and shipped them by bus to our New

york consultants, a group of musicians on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
Following several weeks of refinement and discussion, we all agreed
on this final recipe- a chocolate lover's dream." from Ben and

Recipe by: Hershey Cocoa Can
Combine cocoa, sugar and salt.  Add milk.  Bring to a boil, stirring cons
tantly. Cook to 235 degrees WITHOUT STIRRING AT ALL! Stirring makes grainy
fudge.
(So does stirring before it cools to luke warm.) Immersed pan in cold
water: don't stir until candy is only luke warm. If you have a marble
slab, this is easier. Pour out onto Marble slab: Let stand until lukewarm.
(OK to pour vanilla, etc. right on). Work back & forth until it starts to
set up. Form into a long roll; slice and wrap tightly sealed.

The Five Minute Killer Fudge

chocolate, candy

2/3 cup evaporated milk
1 2/3 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup miniature marshmallows
1 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup nuts

Read all of the instructions before starting.  Wise advice would be
to have the ingredients in the 3rd paragraph ready to go, and also
the pan already buttered.  Do all of this BEFORE you begin to cook.

Combine Milk, Sugar, and Salt in saucepan over medium heat Bring to a
boil and cook 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly (start timing when the
mixture starts to "bubble" around the corners of the pan). Remove
from heat. Add Marshmallows, Chocolate Chips, Nuts and Vanilla. Stir
vigorously for 1 minute (or until Marshmallows are completely melted
and blended).

Pour into a buttered 8" square pan.  Cool until it doesn't fall out or
slosh around in pan.  Eat!

For the totally inept in the kitchen (or kids):

Don't leave out ingredients...So what if you can't find the vanilla.
If you leave it out, the fudge will taste about the same, but it will
be hard enough to use as asphalt patch. You'll ruin the pan using a
chisel to get the fudge out...Don't overcook!...Mix well! You should
end up with a uniform texture about the same appearance as Hershey's
Syrup... It has to cool before it turns solid...Buttering the pan
means putting just a little butter or margarine on a clean piece of
paper toweling and rubbing the bottom of the pan with it. Pretend
your waxing the car.

The Rockettes' Fudge Brownie Tart

chocolate, deserts, tarts

1/4 lb (1 stick) unsalted butter
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup sugar
9 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1 oz unsweetened chocolate, chopped
2  eggs
1 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon grand marnier
1/2 cup chocolate chips

Preheat the oven to 350  F. Butter and flour a 10-inch tart pan with a
removable bottom. In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, combine the
butter and the sugars. Cook, stirring constantly, until the butter is
melted, 4 to 6 minutes. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the
bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate and process until finely
chopped, 15 to 20 seconds. Add the hot butter-sugar mixture and
process for 15 more seconds. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the
eggs and vanilla. Process to combine, about 10 seconds. Add the
flour, salt, walnuts, and Grand Marnier. Pulse briefly 10 times, just
to mix.

Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan and sprinkle the top
with chocolate chips. Bake 25 to 30 minutes; a toothpick inserted
near the center will come out moist. Do not overbake. Remove the
sides of the pan and cool on a wire rack. Cut into wedges and serve.

White Chocolate Lasagna With Peanut Ice Cream & Hot Fudge

beverages, nuts, eggs, spreads

3 1/2 cup half & half
8  egg yolks
1 3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup unsalted dry-roasted peanuts
1  coarsely chopped(about 5 oz)
3 oz bars white chocolate; broken
1  in half widthwise
16 oz bittersweet chocolate
8 oz unsalted butter
1 cup evaporated milk
1  mint sprigs for garnish

In medium saucepan, scald the half & half over medium heat, set aside. In
medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 3/4 cup sugar, a pinch of salt,
and 1 tsp of the vanilla.  Gradually whisk in the half & half and transfer
to the saucepan.  Cook this mixture over moderate heat, stirring
constantly, until just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (165 on a
candy thermometer).  This will take 10-15 minutes.  DO NOT bring to a boil
or you'll have a curdled mess on your hands.  Remove from heat and whisk
in the peanut butter, then add the cream. Strain this custard into a bowl
and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until well chilled.  In the
meantime, line a 10-by-15 inch jelly roll pan with wax paper.  Transfer
custard to a Donvier or other ice cream freezer and freeze until thickened
but still pourable.  Add peanuts.  Pour mixture into the jelly roll pan,
spread evenly, cover, and freeze overnight.

Prepare sugar syrup by mixing the remaining 1 cup of sugar with 1 cup of
water.  Bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar, then remove from heat and
set aside 'til later.

Preheat oven on lowest setting for 5 minutes, then turn it off. Place the
6 pieces of white chocolate on a large baking sheet lined with wax paper.
Place in the warm oven until soft enough to yield when pressed by a
finger, about 6 minutes.  Using a metal spatula, transfer a piece of
softened chocolate to an individual piece of wax paper (at least 12 inches
long) and cover with a second sheet of paper.  Using a large heavy rolling
pin, gently roll the chocolate between the paper to form a thin sheet of
chocolate, about 11 by 4 inches.  Set each sheet of chocolate aside while
you repeat this with the rest of the chocolate. Line 3 baking sheets with
wax paper.  When the white chocolate is cooled and firm, remove the top
piece of paper from each chocolate sheet. Using a pizza wheel or long
sharp knife, trim the edges of each sheet to make a neat 3-by-10-inch
rectangle, then cut each rectangle crosswise to form two 3-by-5-inch
pieces.  Transfer 4 rectangles to each of the prepared baking sheets.
Keep cool.

In a double boiler, melt the bittersweet chocolate with the butter,
stirring until smooth.  Transfer to a bowl.  Whisk in 1 cup of the
reserved sugar syrup.  Stir in the evaporated milk and 1 tsp. vanilla. Set
aside, covered.  Note:  this sauce can be made up to 1 week in advance and
kept, covered, in the fridge.

With a pizza cutter or thin sharp knife, cut the ice cream into ten
3-by-5-inch rectangles.  There will be a little left over; do what you
will with it. ;-)  With a spatula, place a piece of the ice cream on each
of the 4 pieces of white chocolate.  Top each with another piece of
chocolate, then another layer of ice cream, then another piece of
chocolate.  Freeze for 3 to 4 hours.

To serve, remove the assembled lasagnas from the freezer and allow to
soften slightly at room temperature for a few minutes.  Gently reheat the
fudge sauce in the top of a double boiler or in the microwave. Place each
of the portions to serving plates, spoon fudge sauce over, garnish with
mint, and serve immediately.
