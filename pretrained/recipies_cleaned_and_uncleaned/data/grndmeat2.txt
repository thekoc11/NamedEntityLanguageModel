Panfried Quail

poultry, game

1 cup white grapes (to make 1/4 to 1/3 cu; p grape juice)
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
8 quart split and flattened
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
1/2 cup virginia ham, cut into 2 by 1/4 inc; h matchsticks

First, make the fresh white grape juice.  Crush the cup of grapes in a
pestle, then put through a sieve or vegetable mill to extract the
juice, or use a potato ricer. Combine the salt, pepper, and thyme,
crushing the thyme with your fingertips.  Sprinkle both sides of the
birds with the seasonings. Melt the butter in a large skillet over
medium heat until it foams and just begins to brown. Add the quail,
skin-side down. Sprinkle with ham, cover and cook for 3 to 4 minutes,
until the skin is golden brown. Turn the birds and continue cooking,
covered, until the juices run clear, about 4 minutes longer. Take the
pan from the heat and let the quail rest, covered, for about 10
minutes. Arrange the quail on a platter and sprinkle the ham from the
pan over them. Pour the fat from the pan. Add the grape juice (you
can also use water, if you prefer), and bring to a boil. Cook for 1
minute, scraping the browned bits from the bottom to deglaze the pan.
Pour over the quail and serve.

1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup olive oil

Partridge With Mole Sauce

poultry, game

1  stephen ceideburg
4  partridges, about 1 pound. each
1/4 cup all-purpose white flour
1  salt and freshly ground black peppe; r to taste
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
2  cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro
1 1/4 cup defatted chicken stock or water
2  canned or fresh plum tomatoes, coar; sely chopped
1  bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup pepitas (green pumpkin seeds)
1/2  dried mild dried pepper
1  chipotle pepper or to taste, seeds; removed
1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate, chopped

This is a strong sauce, but partridge is an intensely flavored bird
and is equal to it. Serve with rice or soft flour tortillas. Note:
Pasilla and ancho peppers can be ordered from Dean and DeLuca, 560
Broadway, New York, NY 10012, (800) 221-7714.

Tie partridge legs together and secure to the body with a toothpick.
Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon. salt and 1/2 teaspoon. pepper in a shallow
dish.
Dredge partridges in flour mixture. Heat oil in a deep casserole with
a lid over medium-high heat. Brown partridge in batches, turning, for
about 5 minutes. Set aside. Add to the pot onions, garlic, 1 Tbsp.
cilantro and 1/4 cup stock or water and cook for about 2 minutes, or
until softened. Add tomatoes, bay leaf, thyme, cinnamon and remaining
1 cup stock or water. Return birds to the pot, bring to a boil,
reduce heat and cover. Simmer, basting occasionally, for 20 to 30
minutes, or until the birds are tender and their juices run clear
when they are pierced with a fork.

Meanwhile, roast pepitas over medium heat in a small, dry skillet,
stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes, or until lightly browned.
Set aside. Roast pasilla and chipotle peppers in the same skillet for
about 30 to
40    seconds until fragrant.

Remove birds from the casserole dish and cool slightly. With poultry
shears, cut them in half, discarding the back bone. Set aside and
cover with foil to keep warm. Boil the sauce over high heat for 5 to
10 minutes, stirring often, until it has been reduced to 1 cup. Add
pepitas, dried peppers and chipotles to the cooking liquid and cook
for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove bay leaf and transfer the sauce to a
blender or food processor. Add chocolate and blend until smooth. If
the sauce seems too thick, add a little stock or water.

Return the sauce to the casserole dish and heat through briefly over
low heat. Taste for seasoning: it should be smoky, hot and slightly
bitter. Nap the birds with the sauce and garnish with the remaining 2
Tbsp. cilantro.

Pasta Al Cioccolato In Dolce-Forte

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
      ----SAUCE----
1 medium red onion
3  celery stalks
1 medium garlic clove
2 medium carrots
10  sprigs Italian parsley, leaves only
4 ounce pancetta
1/2 cup olive oil
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup dry red wine
1 cup drained canned imported Italian tom; atoes
1  salt, freshly ground pepper to tast; e
      ----DOLCEFORTE----
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
4 tablespoon raisins
2 tablespoon pine nuts
1 tablespoon semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon sugar
      ----PASTA----
3 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
4  extra-large eggs
2 teaspoon olive oil (optional)
4  level tablespoons unsweetened cocoa; powder
      ----FOR PASTA----
1  coarse salt

The sauce: Finely chop onion, celery, garlic, carrots and parsley
together on a board or in a food processor. Cut pancetta into small
pieces.

Heat the oil in a terra-cotta or enamel saucepan. When hot, add the
chopped ingredients and pancetta and saute slowly over low heat for
about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Mix in
ground beef and when it is no longer reddish, add wine and let it
evaporate for about 5 minutes.

Pass the tomatoes through a food mill to remove seeds and, when the
wine has evaporated, add tomatoes to the saucepan. Taste for salt and
pepper and simmer slowly for about 25 minutes.

Dolce-forte: Put all 5 ingredients in a small bowl and set aside for
about 20 minutes. When the meat sauce is ready, add the dolce-forte
to the saucepan. Stir to incorporate and simmer 5 minutes longer.

The pasta: You can make it by hand, of course, but this seems the
simpler way. Place ingredients in a food processor with the metal
blade and pulse on and off until a ball of dough forms. Turn out,
gently knead into a ball, cover with a towel and let rest about 1/2
hour. Divide dough into quarters and knead until smooth by putting
through pasta machine rollers, starting with widest setting and
working down to the last setting (pasta will be very, very thin). Cut
into tagliatelle (the wider cutter) and let stand on a board, loosely
covered with a clean towel, until needed (do not let dry out).

Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil. Add coarse-grained salt to
taste. Prepare a warmed serving dish by spreading 1 cup of the sauce
over the bottom.

Add the pasta to the boiling salted water and cook for about 30
seconds after the water has returned to a boil. Drain and put in
prepared serving dish. Pour remaining sauce over pasta and toss very
well. Serve immediately.

Pat's Famous Meatballs For His Famous Pasta Sauce

meats, italian

4 1/2 pound ground chuck or lean beef
2  eggs
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
3 cup or more Italian bread crumbs
3/4 cup or more grated romano cheese

In a very large bowl, add all ingredients except the cheese. The
mixture will be very very dry (this is good, as the crumbs will ab-
sorb any fats in the sauce!). Mix well. Add the cheese.

Form meatballs to the size you desire and saute all sides until just
brown. Drop in the sauce you are making.

This recipe will make 24 +/- "larger than golf-ball size", or smaller,
depending on your desires.

Picadillo

meats, latin

3 tablespoon olive oil or vegetable oil
2 pound ground beef, lean
1 large onion, finely chopped
1  garlic clove, finely chopped
3 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped
2  tart cooking apples, peeled, cored; and chopped
1/2 cup almonds, slivered
1  jalapeno chili, seeded and chopped; (or more to taste)
1/2 cup raisins (soaked 10 minutes in warm; water)
1/2 cup pimento-stuffed olives, halved cros; swise
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1  salt
1  pepper
1 tablespoon butter

Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet.  Add the beef and saute until it is
lightly browned, stirring to break up any lumps.  Add the onion and garlic
and saute for 5 minutes longer. Add all the remaining ingredients except
the butter and the almonds. Mix well and simmer, uncovered, over moderate
heat, stirring from time to time, for 20 minutes.

In a small skillet, heat the butter and saute the almonds until they are
golden brown.

Mound the beef onto a serving platter and sprinkle with the almonds.
Surround it with a border of rice.

NOTES:

*  Latin-American seasoned chopped beef -- I got this recipe from net.cooks
in the fall of 1983. It was posted by houxm!houxz!llf.

*  Picadillo is a great favorite throughout Latin America, and every
country has its own version. In Mexico it is much appreciated as a filling
for tacos, empanadas, tamales and green peppers. In the north of the
country it is popular on its own and is eaten as a main dish, accompanied
by rice, beans, guacamole and tortillas.

*  Variations:  Instead of oregano and thyme, use a pinch or two of
cinnamon and ground cloves. This makes an interesting difference in flavor,
giving the dish an almost Middle Eastern taste.

*  In Chihuahua, the apple is left out and 4 medium potatoes, cooked and
cubed, and about 2 C cooked green peas are added to the beef at the end of
the cooking time for just long enough to heat them through. This makes a
nice one-dish meal.

*  Picadillo de la Costa from the state of Guerrero, best known for the
beach resort of Acapulco, uses the tropical fruits in which the region
abounds, and instead of beef uses an equal mixture of ground pork and veal.
The method is the same but the meats, with the onion, garlic, tomatoes, hot
peppers, salt and pepper, are cooked, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Then add
about 1 1/2 C pineapple chunks, 2 pears (peeled, cored and cut in chunks)
and 2 bananas (peeled and sliced) are added and the mixture simmered for 15
minutes longer over low heat. Sprinkle with almonds just before serving.
This is a delicious summer dish, good with plain rice.

*  In addition to the almonds, I add fresh coriander leaves as a garnish.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Pikanta Oxrulader (Beef Stuffed W/Anchovies &

main dish, meats, swedish

2 pound steak; top round
1  salt and fresh ground pepper
4 tablespoon butter
4 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup onions; finely chopped
2 tablespoon flour
16  flat anchovy fillets; washed and dried
1/2 cup water

Cut the meat into 8 slices of 6x3 inches each and pound them to 1/8" thick,
between 2 pieces of wax paper with a meat pounder, the flat of a cleaver
or bottom of a pot. Trim to the above size. Heat 1 tablespoon of butter
with 2 tablespoons oil in a small skillet and saute the onions for 5 to 8
minutes or until tender and golden. Remove from heat and stir in flour.
Return to heat and cook 1 or 2 minutes. Reserve 2 tablespoons of this roux
for the sauce. Sprinkle each slice of meat with salt and pepper and spread
the remaining roux evening over the meat. Lay 2 anchovy fillets on each
slice, roll them up securely and either tie with a loop of cord at each end
or fasten with a wooden toothpick inserted through the roll lengthwise.
Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in a
heavy 10-12" saute pan over moderate heat. When the foam subsides, add the
roulades, 4 at a time. Turn them with kitchen tongs to brown on all sides.
Arrange the browned roulades in a single layer in a 2 - 2 1/2 quart
casserole or baking dish that has a cover. The preparation of the roulades
may be done in advance up to this point. Preheat the oven to 350øF. Deglaze
the pan by pouring in 1/2 cup of water and boiling for 1 or 2 minutes,
stirring to scrape up any bits clinging to the pan. Add the 2 tablespoons
of roux that you kept aside and cook over medium-high heat for 2 or 3 more
minutes, stirring briskly, until the sauce has thickened. Pour over the
roulades, cover and bake for 45 minutes. Serve the oxrulader with mashed
potatoes and gherkins or relish.

Plainest Italian Sausage

meats, italian

8  foot of sausage casing,  packed in; salt
1 1/2 pound boneless pork
1/2 pound fresh pork fat
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoon fennel seeds  lightly crushed
2 tablespoon dry red wine

SCRAPE THE LOOSE SALT OFF the sausage casing and set the casing in a
bowl of cold water to soften for at least 30 minutes. (You will need
only about 4 feet of casing for this amount of meat, but it's useful
to have extra in case of ruptures.) Cut the pork and fat into pieces
that will go through your meat grinder and grind them, using the
coarse blade. Mix the salt, pepper and fennel seeds thoroughly into
the ground meat. (Hands are the best implement.) Then mix in the
wine. Drain the casing, open one end gently with your fingers and run
a stream of cold water into it, to flush any remaining salt out of
the interior. Thread the casing onto the stuffing horn and fit the
horn over the meat grinder. Feed the sausage meat through the horn,
supporting the emerging tube of sausage with your hands to prevent
rips. (Actually, sausage making is much more conveniently done with
two people.) When all the sausage meat is in the casing, lay the
filled tube on the work surface and pinch it at 4-inch intervals to
produce individual sausage links. At the same time, fill and firm any
air pockets in the casing. Tie off the links with kitchen string.
Coil the sausages onto a plate and set it, uncovered, in the
refrigerator to season for 48 hours. Turn the sausages over once or
twice during that time.

Polish Kielbasa

meats, makemeat

6  feet large (2-1/2-inch diameter) ho; g casings
3 pound lean pork butt, cubed
1 pound lean beef chuck, cubed
1/2 pound veal, cubed
1/2 pound pork fat, cubed
2 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
3 teaspoon finely ground black pepper
2 teaspoon ground marjoram
2 teaspoon ground summer savory
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
3  cloves garlic, finely minced
2 tablespoon sweet paprika

"Recipes for this sausage are so variable that what passes for kielbasa in
one area might be regarded as not authentic in another. The ingredients and
pronunciation of kielbasa are as variable as are the vagaries of the spring
weather, the time of year when kielbasa is traditionally made. This version
uses pork, beef, and veal and makes five pounds."

1. Prepare the casings.

2. Grind the meats and fat together through the coarse disk.

3. Mix the remaining ingredients with the meat.

4. Stuff the casings and leave the sausage in long links. Lengths of
eighteen inches to two feet are traditional.

5. Allow the sausage to dry in a cool place for three or four hours or
refrigerate for twenty-four hours uncovered.

6. Cook by roasting in a 425~ F. oven for forty-five minutes. These
sausages are also excellent grilled over a charcoal fire and eaten in a
Kaiser roll, lathered with a spicy brown mustard.

Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces.  Sprinkle the meat with the salt
and pepper.  Heat the butter in a casserole, and add the sage,
juniper berries, mint, cinnamon and nutmeg. Cook, stirring
constantly, for 3 minutes. Add the meat and brown on all sides.
Lower the heat and add the wine. Simmer, covered, until the meat is
tender (it took me a little more than an hour with the kid I had).
Remove the meat and keep warm. Strain the sauce. Put the sauce back
in the casserole, and stir in the cream and rum. Bring to a boil and
reduce to the consistency of heavy cream. Return the meat to the
sauce and heat through.  Serve with dry boiled rice and green peas.
(it says here: but I served it with wide homemade egg noodles, and I
think that works better than rice would, even if not strictly the way
they would do it in Locarno.)

Pueblana Tinga

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
5 large ripe tomatoes (2 1/2 pounds)
3  garlic cloves, each cut into thirds
2  chipotle chiles abobado (see note)
2 teaspoon olive oil
2 medium onions
1/2 pound very lean bulk mexican chorizo saus; age
2 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon adobo juice from can of chipotles
1/2  cinnamon stick
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1  shredded roast pork or chicken (see; recipes)
1  ripe avocado, thinly sliced, for ga; rnish
1  red onion, sliced into rings, for g; arnish

Serve this as a stew with steamed white or brown rice. Accompany with
avocado and onion slices. Tinga is also good served in warmed,
scooped out French rolls or bolillos (Mexican rolls). You can add
avocado slices, onion and a mild white cheese such as Jack to the
sandwich. With a glass of icy beer and a salad, you have everything
you need.

Put tomatoes on a jelly-roll pan and place about 8 inch inches under a
preheated broiler. Broil until tomato skins turn brownish, about 10
minutes. Peel, cut in half horizontally and squeeze out seeds. Place
tomatoes in a food processor along with garlic and chipotle chiles.
Chop into a coarse puree.

Heat olive oil in a skillet. Add onions and saute for 5 minutes until
softened. Remove and set aside Using the same skillet, fry the chorizo
until well cooked. If the sausage is fatty, drain on paper towels and
wipe out skillet. Return the sausage and onion to skillet and add the
tomato-chipotle mixture along with vinegar, sugar, salt, adobo juice
and spices. Simmer for 20 minutes.

Add the shredded pork or chicken, and simmer 20 to 25 minutes to blend
flavors. If the mixture seems dry, add 1/2 cup broth or water.

To Serve: Serve as a spicy stew with steamed rice. Or use as a
filling for Mexican bolillos: Cut rolls in half and pull out some of
the soft crumbs. Pile onion rings and avocado slices into the halves,
then spoon on the tinga.

Note: Chipotles are sold in 8-ounce cans labeled "chipotles
adobados." They are found in Mexican grocery stores and in the ethnic
sections of some supermarkets.

Puerto Rican Beef Plantain Omelette (Pinon)

beef

3  plantains -- very ripe
1  oil -- for frying
1  onion -- chopped
1/2  green bell pepper --
1  chopped
2  cloves garlic
1/2 pound ground beef
1/4 cup tomato sauce
1 tablespoon capers
1 tablespoon green olives -- sliced
1  salt and pepper
1/2 pound green beans -- cut in 3-inch
1  pieces
6  eggs
1/4 cup butter

Plantains are good sliced and sauteed. They're also good substituted
into any recipe that uses cooked bananas. Many caribbean recipes that
call for banana originally called for plantain, but the recipe-writer
thought you wouldn't have access to plantain.

The recipe is a little heavy in the fat department, so I usually
leave out the meat, and skimp on the oil and butter. (I don't know
how authentic the veggie version is!) Also, the author wants us to
boil the beans to death. I have taken the liberty of changing that in
the body of the recipe.

Use fresh or frozen green beans.

Peel the plantains, cut into 2-inch thick legthwise slices, and fry
in oil till golden brown. Remove, drain, and keep warm.

In a frying pan, saute the onion, green pepper, and garlic until soft
but not brown. Add the ground beef and fry at high heat for 3
minutes. Pour in the tomato sauce and add the capers and olives, if
desired. Cook 15 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Wash the string beans and steam
till tender.

Beat the eggs, adding salt and pepper to taste. Butter the sides and
bottom of a round casserole and melt the remaining butter in the
bottom.

Pour in *half* of the beaten eggs and cook over medium heat for about
1 minute or until slightly set. Cover the eggs with one-third of the
plantain slices, following with layers of half the ground meat and
half the string beans. Add another layer of plantains, the remainder
of the ground beef, another layer of beans, and top with plantains.
Pour the rest of the beaten eggs over the top.

Cook over low heat for 15 minutes, uncovered, being careful not to
let the omelette burn. Then place in a preheated 350-degree oven for
10 to 15 minutes to brown the top of the pin~on. Serve with rice and
beans.

Excellent for lunch.

Raan Masaledar - Whole Leg Of Lamb In A Spicy

main dish, meats, lamb, indian

5 pound lamb, leg of
      ----SAUCE----
2 ounce almonds, blanched
1/2 pound onions, coarsely chopped
8  garlic cloves, peeled
4  cubes ginger, 1, peeled
1  ; chopped coarsely
4  green chillies, chopped
20 fl ounce yoghurt, plain
2 tablespoon cumin seed, ground
4 teaspoon coriander seed, ground
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
6 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon whole cloves
16  cardamom pods
1  cinnamon stick, 2 long
10  peppercorns, black
      ----GARNISH----
4 tablespoon sultana raisins
1/2 ounce almonds, blanched, slivered

Make sure that all the fat has been trimmed from the outside of the
leg and that most of the fell (parchment-like white skin) has been
pulled off. Put the leg in a baking dish made, preferably, of pyrex
or stainless steel. Put the 2 ounce. almonds, onions, garlic, ginger,
green chillies, and 3 tablespoons of the yoghurt into the container
of a food processor or blender and blend until you have a paste. Put
the remaining yoghurt into a bowl. Beat lightly with a fork or a
whisk until it is smooth and creamy. Add the paste from the
processor, the cumin, coriander, cayenne, salt and garam masala. Mix.
Push some of the spice paste into all the openings in the lamb. Be
quite generous. (I forgot to say, you need to ask the butcher to make
a deep pocket to hold a "stuffing", in this case, some spice paste
mixture, or make a pocket yourself) Spread the paste evenly on the
underside of the leg (the side that originally had less fat.) Now,
using a small, sharp, pointed knife make deep slashes in the meat,
and push in the spice paste with your fingers. Turn the leg over so
its outer side (the side that was once covered with fat) is on the
top. Spread a very thick layer of paste over it. Again, make deep
slashes with the knife and push the spice paste into the slashes.
Pour all the remaining spice paste over and around the meat. Cover
with plastic cling film and refrigerate for 24 hours. Take the baking
dish with the meat out of the refrigerator and let the meat come to
room temperature. Remove the cling film. Heat the oil in a small
frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cloves,
cardamom, cinnamon and peppercorns. When the cloves swell - this
takes just a few seconds - pour the hot oil and spices over the leg
of lamb. (My note: I found the spices jumped and spat in the oil
quite a lot - make sure your arms and counter are well protected)
Preheat the oven gas mark 6, 400 F. Cover the baking dish tightly
either with its own lid or with a large piece of aluminium foil.
Bake, covered, for 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake
uncovered for 45 minutes. Baste 3-4 times with the sauce during this
period. Scatter, or arrange in a pattern, the sultanas and the 1/2
ounce. almonds over the top of the leg and bake for another 5-6 minutes.
Remove the baking dish from the oven and let it sit in a warm place
for 15 minutes. Take the leg out of the pan and set it on a warm
platter. Spoon off all the fat from the top of the sauce. Use a
slotted spoon and fish out all the whole spice in the sauce. Discard
the spices. Pour the sauce around the leg. My Notes: I served the
sauce separately, in a gravy boat. It is delicious!

Red Cooked Beef With Gravy Noodles

beef, chinese

1 pound boned chuck roast or thick steak
3 tablespoon cooking oil
2 tablespoon peanut oil or deep frying oil
2  scallions, coarsely chopped
2  cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced
4 large stalks napa cabbage, leaves removed; ,
1  cut in 2 squares
1/2 pound fresh egg noodles
      ----REDCOOKING LIQUID----
1 teaspoon sichuan peppercorns
4 cup water
1/2 cup black soy sauce
2 tablespoon chinjiang vinegar
2  scallions
3 slice ginger
1  piece dried licorice root (opt)
      ----GRAVY INGREDIENTS----
1 1/4 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoon medium sherry
1 teaspoon ground bean sauce
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1  cornstarch paste

A fatty cut of beef gives this dish more beef flavor, which is the
point of the dish; rich, mellow, gently seasoned.

Red-Cooking Meat:   In medium hot wok, toast peppercorns until fra-
grant (avoid burning); crush and finely mince with cleaver; reserve.
Cut beef into 1 1/2" chunks. Heat cooking oil in hot wok until it
starts to smoke; brown beef in several batches; drain oil and discard.
Combine peppercorns and remaining ingredients of red-cooking liquid;
add to wok. Bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 1 1/2
to 2 hours, until meat is very tender.  (If liquid evaporates before
meat is tender, add cup of water or stock and continue cooking.)
Remove meat from liquid. If desired, cool meat, cover and refrigerate.

Boiling Noodles:  Bring 4 qts. water to rolling boil; add noodles.
Drain when still slightly undercooked.

Stir-frying:  Heat peanut oil in hot wok.  When oil starts to smoke,
add scallions and stir-fry until fragrant. Add garlic, ginger and Napa
cabbage; stir-fry for about 1 minute, until cabbage is slightly wilt-
ed. Add meat and all gravy ingredients except cornstarch paste. Reduce
heat to medium, cover, and simmer for about 3 minutes. Remove cover;
dribble in enough cornstarch paste to make a light gravy; not too
heavy as you want to coat noodles, but not too soupy either. Turn up
heat; when sauce returns to boil, add noodles. Toss to mix (and reheat)
noodles. Transfer to warmed serving platter or large bowl.

Red Creek Gourmet Beef Jerkey Rounds

meats, preserving

5 pound whole eye of round
7 ounce red creek jerky marinade
1  coarse ground black pepper
1  large bowl or-
1  gallon-size zip lock bags
1  wax paper
1  rolling pin
1  dehydrator or- conventional oven
1  aluminum foil if using oven

This recipe is from the Red Creek Marinade Company

1. Place meat slices into a large bowl or a gallon-sized zip lock
freezer bag. Pour 1 to 1 1/2 ounce. Red Creek Jerkey Marinade per pound
of meat over the slices. Be sure to vigorously shake the bottle of
marinade prior to pouring.

2. Work marinade into meat so that each slice is thoroughly exposed to
marinade and place in refrigerator for three to four hours. At this
stage, slices can be marinated up to 24 hours if desired. Meat should
absorb all of marinade. If not, use a colander to drain any remaining
marinade from meat.

3. If additional black pepper is desired, lay meat slices out flat on
waxed paper, sprinkle with coarsely ground black pepper and roll
pepper in to the surface of the meat slices with a rolling pin or
"pat" it in by hand.

4. Continue with either the dehydrator method or oven method of
drying to the jerky stage.

Dehydrator Method:

Place marinated meat slices on dehydrator racks and dry to jerky stage
according to dehydrator manufacturer's diredtions. Length of drying
time will depend on size and type of dehydrator used, and whether or
not your dehydrator is constructed with a heating element only or
with both a heating element and fan. If your dehydrator has a
temperature gauge, dry at its maximum setting (but no more that 165
degrees). Check drying process periodically. It may be necessary to
rearrange placement of racks to insure even drying of meat slices.

Oven Method:

Place a layer of heavy duty aluminum foil or a large jelly roll pan
on the bottom oven rack to catch any drips or black pepper. Heat oven
to 165 degrees and place marinated meat slices in single layer
directly on oven racks. Dry meat slices with oven door slightyly ajar
so that moisture can escape, turning occasionally until meat is dried
to jerky stage.

Things to remember:

The thicker the meat is sliced, the longer the drying process will be.

Finish jerky yield will be less than raw meat yield.

Unless dried to 0 moisture level, refrigerate finished product.

Roast Beef In Bourbon Sauce

main dish, meats

1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup bourbon
1 large onion; thinly sliced
2 large cloves garlic; minced
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup wine or cider vinegar
1  rib-eye or first cut chuck
1  or boneless round steak
1  about 5 to 6 pounds

Combine the oil, bourbon, onion, garlic, pepper, mustard, salt and
vinegar, blending well.  Place the meat in a plastic bag or glass
dish. Pour the marinade over the meat and marinate 1 hour at room
temperature, turning the meat 2 to 3 times.  Drain the meat,
reserving the marinade. Spit the meat from end to end through the
center or on a diagonal, making sure that the roast is balanced.  If
the meat has not been tied already, tie it after you have fastened it
in place with the spit forks--it will be a little firmer that way.
Engage the spit and turn the meat, 8 to 10 inches above hot coals,
for 1 1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer registers 120 degrees F.
for rare, to  2 1/2 hours for well-done, 165 Degrees F on the meat
thermometer.  Brush with the sauce for the last 30 minutes of
cooking. To roast on the grill, place the meat over a drip pan with
the hot coals surrounding the drip pan, or pushed back. Turn and
baste the meat as needed to cook evenly.  Grill 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Let the meat stand, on a platter, 20 to 30 minutes before carving.
Heat the sauce and serve with the meat.

NOTE:

Any leftovers make great sandwiches and beef salads.

Roast Fillet Of Beef

meats

1  fillet of beef (5-6 pound)  trimmed
5  garlic cloves; slivered
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1  Tabasco sauce
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup olive oil
1 cup port wine
2 teaspoon thyme
1 bunch watercress

TO PREPARE THE FILLET, MAKE slits in it and put slivers of garlic in
the slits. Rub well with salt, pepper and Tabasco. Combine the soy
sauce, olive oil, port and herbs and place the fillet in this
marinade in a baking dish for at least 1/2 hour unrefrigerated, or an
hour or more in the refrigerator. Turn several times while it is
marinating. Preheat oven to 425F. Place the fillet on a rack in a
roasting pan. Roast for 30-to-35 minutes, basting occasionally with
the marinade. A meat thermometer should register 120F for very rare,
125F for rare, 130F for medium-rare. After it is removed from the
oven, the internal temperature will rise as much as another 10F.
Allow the fillet to rest, covered with foil, up to 30 minutes. If it
needs to sit longer, you might try a catering trick: Wrap the fillet,
just out of the oven, in plastic wrap. Unwrap just before slicing.
Cut into slices and place on a warm platter; garnish with sprigs of
watercress.

Rojos Y Verde (Red & Green)

beef

3 pound lean beef roast
7 can green chilies; (4-oz cans)
20 ounce tomatillos
1 can condensed chicken broth
1  dried red peppers; * see not
1 large onion; white
1  tomato
2  cl garlic
2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon oregano; (mexican)
1  bay leaf

Recipe by: Wayne Preston Allen * arbol, finger-hots, pequins, or thai
peppers

This chili is in the style of New Mexico green chile stew.

Remove stems from red peppers and chop into parts to separate out the
seeds and expose interiors. Cover with boiling water and let sit for
an hour. Blend into smooth sauce with blender. Don't get this stuff
in your eyes! Better yet, wear protective clothing during handling
(I'm only half joking!).

Brown the roast as if making pot roast - coat meat with flour and
brown every surface in olive oil. (Theresa says I can do this almost
as well as her Aunt Tia, the Goddess of Pot Roast - but she's just
being kind.) Add chicken broth and water up to one inch deep and
cover. Simmer meat by itself for one hour over low heat.

Lightly blend the tomatillos and three green chilies in blender. Dice
the remaining green chilies, garlic, onion, and tomatoes. Add the
sauces, vegetables, and spices to the pot with enough water to cover.
When the meat is falling-apart-tender (several more hours,
typically), use two forks to shred it into small chunks.

Serve topped with slices of avacado and white cheese, along with
sides of beans and jalapeno cornbread.

Alternate Version - Instead of a beef roast, use buffalo! I tried this
recipe with ground buffalo ("100% American Bison!"), and was mighty
surprised and pleased. I found this meat and a few other exotics at
Whole Foods Grocery, a health food store in Austin. I'll continue to
experiment and report the results.

Romanian Sausages (Mititei)

meats

5  cloves garlic, peeled
1/4 cup water
1 pound ground chuck
2/3 pound coarsely ground pork
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, whole
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 cup beef stock

Crush the garlic well in the water, using a fork. Stir the meat,
baking soda, seasonings, and garlic puree together. Add Beef Stock
and mix well. For each sausage, take 1/3 cup of the meat mixture, and
roll between the palms of your hands into a sausage shape about 4
inches long. Place sausages side by side in a container and cover.
Refrigerate overnight so that the flavors can blend. These are
excellent on the grill. They may also be broiled or baked in the
oven. Broil the sausages about 3 minutes per side until cooked
through and browned.. HINT: When hand rolling sausages or meatballs
of any kind, keep a small bowl of water near you so that you can keep
your hands a bit wet. This way the meat will not stick to your hands.

Roulo Me Filo

meats, greek

1  karen mintzias
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 small shallot or onion
1 1/2 pound veal, ground
1/2 cup chopped tomatoes or- tomato juice
1  cinnamon stick; -or- ground cinnamon
1  salt; if necessary
1  freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil (more if desire; d)
2  eggs; separated
1 1/2 cup thick saltsa aspri
1/2 cup grated mizithra cheese or- kefaloty; ri cheese
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1  heavy greaseproof paper (about 20 b; y 20 inches)
12  filo pastry sheets
1/3 cup butter or margarine  melted and war; m
2  eggs, hard-cooked; sliced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Heat the butter in a large frying pan, then saute the onion until
soft. Add the meat, mashing it with a fork until the raw color
disappears. Add the tomato and cinnamon, cover and simmer about 20
minutes, stirring once or twice.  Remove the lid and season
judiciously (if the cheese is salty, don't add salt until the very
end). Stir in the basil, then remove the cinnamon stick and cool.
Using a wooden spoon, mix the egg whites into the meat.  Meanwhile,
prepare the saltsa aspri (it must be thick) and combine with the egg
yolks, cheese, and nutmeg. Taste to see if salt is needed.

To make the loaf, spread the baking paper flat on your work surface.
Lay a sheet of filo (keeping the rest covered with a damp towel or
waxed paper) in the center of the paper and brush with butter.
Continue laying filo, one sheet on top of another, brushing each with
butter, to make a large "base" on which to roll the meat loaf (about
15 x 15 inches). Spread half of the saltsa aspri in the center of the
filo, alowing wide margins for turning later.  Spread the meat
mixture over the sauce to a length of about 9 inches. Lay the egg
slices over the meat, cover with the remaining sauce, and sprinkle
with parsley. Turn the edges of the filo up over the meat and roll
into a loaf. Fold the paper over the loaf, secure it, and place, seam
side down, in a baking pan.  Bake for 1 hour in moderate oven (350
F), removing the paper after 35 minutes to allow the filo to get
crisp. Brush the outer surface of the filo with butter or margarine
for a higher golden chestnut color.

With wide spatulas, lift the loaf onto a warm platter. Serve
immediately, with fresh green salad, black olives, and a heady wine.

Sam Arnold's Boneless Rump Roast

main dish, meats

1 single boneless rump roast
1 single salt
1 single fresh rosemary needles
1 single garlic salt
1 single freshly ground black pepper
1 single beer; or
1 single wine; or
1 single vinegar; or
1 single lemon juice
1 single beef stock; or
1 single red wine
1 single minced shallots

NOTE:  This recipe is adjustable to all sizes of roasts. This is the
Marinate the meat for a couple of hours in a liquid that is slightly
acidic--a liquid such as wine, beer, vinegar, or lemon juice. Roast for 15
minutes per pound at 325 degrees F.  For the last 15 minutes, cook at 500
degrees F.  For example, for a 4 pound roast, total cooking time is 1 hour
but it will be 45 minutes at 325 degrees F. and 15 minutes at 500 degrees
F.  This will crust the outside of the roast and the inside will be medium,
barely pink.
This is based on room temperature meat.  If the meat is quite cold, extend
the baking time.  After 3/4 of the cooking time, sprinkle with salt and
some fresh or dry rosemary needles. Turn the roast with WOODEN SPOONS (Very
important that you do not pierce the meat) and season it all over.
Rosemary, seasoned salt or garlic salt are nice, and some freshly ground
black pepper adds to the flavor also. Swab the roast with some fresh lemon
juice--this will also add to the zing of the meat. When cooked, snip off
the cords and slice to serve. From the roasting pan, spoon off the fat from
the accumulated juice.  Add some beef stock or red wine to the juices, a
few minced shallots or green onion shreds and cook down at high heat to a
reduction or concentrated sauce. Adjust the seasonings, salt, pepper, and
herbs of your choice, and serve with the roast.

Scaloppine Di Vitello All'agro

meats, european

2 pound veal scaloppine
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1  salt and freshly ground
1  pepper to taste
1/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  juice of 2 lemons
3 tablespoon chopped parsley
2  garlic cloves - chopped
2 tablespoon capers

Place scaloppine between 2 pieces of waxed paper and pound until thin.
When pounding meat do not use a straight up-and-down movement. Use a
sliding action so meat is stretched more than flattened (I use the edge of
a saucer for this).  Coat meat lightly with flour. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper.  Melt 3 tablespoons butter with oil in a large heavy skillet. When
butter foams, add veal.  Cook over high heat about 1 minute on each side.
Veal should be light golden outside and pink inside.
Place veal on a warm platter.  Add 1 tablespoon butter and lemon juice to
skillet.  Deglaze skillet by stirring to disolve meat juices attached to
bottom of skillet.  Stir in parsley, garlic and capers. Taste and adjust
sauce for seasoning, then spoon over veal. Serve immediately.

Scrapple (Allen)

meats

4 pound pork scraps with bones or 1 hog's h; ead, split
1 teaspoon salt
6  peppercorns
3  whole cloves
1  bay leaf
2 cup cornmeal
1  onion, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon or more ground sage
1  salt and freshly ground pepper

Here's a Pennsylvania Dutch version of scrapple. You'll probably have
better luck rounding up pork scraps than a pig's head, although you
could probably pick one up at an Asian or Latino market.

Parboil pork scraps or head, in water to cover, for 10 minutes. Drain;
discard water. return to pot with fresh water to cover, salt,
peppercorns, cloves and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer
for 3 hours, or until meat falls off the bones easily. Strain stock;
reserve. Remove all meat from bones and chop; set aside.

Reheat stock; gradually add cornmeal, stirring constantly until thick,
about 15 minutes.  Add meat, onion, cayenne, nutmeg and sage; adjust
seasonings with salt and pepper. Pour into 2 greased loaf pans.
Refrigerate until set.  Slice and fry for breakfast. Will keep in the
refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Serves 12.

2  cloves garlic; minced or mas
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1/4 cup sesame seed
3 pound spareribs

In a large pot, combine first seven ingredients. Cut spare ribs into
serving size pieces (I prefer small back ribs for this recipe) and
place in pot with sauce. bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes,
turning ribs occasionally. Remove ribs from sauce and place in a
single layer in a shallow baking pan. Skim fat from sauce and baste
meat with some of the sauce. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until
tender, occasionally turning and basting with remaining sauce. Broil
ribs for about 5 minutes to finish browning. Note: Par-boiled ribs
can be grilled on the barbecue, but baste with sauce only during the
last 5 minutes. I usually serve these ribs with steamed rice and a
leafy salad. I hope you enjoy these ribs as much as I do. JOYCE in

1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup minced onion
2  carrots; shredded or chopped
2  eggs

easier serving, let meatloaf stand at room temperature at least 5
minutes before slicing.    This recipe can be varied a lot. For
example, use cooked rice or oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs.
Instead of the milk, use tomato sauce, 1 cup of cottage cheese or 1
cup of stewed tomatoes . Naturally, various spices can be added.
Notes from Gaye: Since I love meatloaf but hate mixing it up, I
delegated the job to my husband Shelly. EVERYONE loves this meatloaf,
including non-meat eaters (like me).

Siberian Pelmeni (Meat-Filled Noodles With Va

main dish, meats, asian

3 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
2  egg yolks
2/3 cup water, plus or minus 1 tb
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 pound ground pork
2  onions, minced
2  cloves garlic, minced
1/4 pound fresh mushrooms, chopped  fine, opt; ional
1  pepper vinegar, optional
1  sour cream, optional
1  brown butter, optional
1  spicy tomato sauce, optional

Culinary success "depends, above all, on one's ability to communicate
with other people, to let one's self be inspired by other people, or to
pull them under one's spell," writes Markus Wolf in the introduction to his
new cookbook, "The Secrets of Russian Cooking."

Cold Warriors and thriller devotees will recall Wolf as the long-time
head of East Germany's Main Intelligence Administration, usually known by
its German initials, HVA, and considered the most effective foreign spying
agency from Berlin to Bucharest.

This is Markus Wolf's favorite dish. He says this version of the recipe
was given to him by his late brother, Konrad, who is a central figure in
Wolf's nostalgic 1987 memoir, "The Troika." Wolf describes the "joy of
companionship" that is achieved when you hand your guests aprons and invite
them to take part in the process of making pelmeni. He adds that a glass of
vodka is a must with pelmeni.

Put flour in bowl. Press hollow in middle and add salt and egg yolks and
1/2 cup water. Using knife or big spoon, mix egg yolks first with water and
then some of flour. Slowly add rest of water until mixture forms dough.
Knead dough with both hands until workable and free of lumps. If dough is
too sticky, add some flour. Dough should form solid ball.
Sprinkle thin layer of flour onto flat surface. Divide dough into 3
pieces. Roll out 1 piece of dough until thin. Keep remaining dough covered
under damp towel. Cut dough in circles about 2 inches in diameter. Repeat
with remaining dough.
Combine beef, pork, onions, garlic and mushrooms in bowl. Place 1
teaspoon meat mixture on each dough circle, then bend other side and press
to seal, forming half-moons. Use some water, if necessary, brushed lightly
on edges to make them stick. Keep finished pelmeni either on waxed paper or
board sprinkled with flour.
Pelmeni can be frozen at this point and cooked later.
Cook 20 to 25 pelmeni at a time, uncovered, in plenty of rapidly boiling
lightly salted water, about 5 minutes. Repeat until all pelmeni are cooked.
Serve pelmeni either in clear soup (beef or, preferably, poultry) or as
main course with pepper vinegar, sour cream, brown butter or spicy tomato
sauce.
Makes 60 pelmeni, or 4 main-course servings.

Sik Sik We't (Beef Stew In Red Pepper Sauce)

beef

2 cup onions -- finely chopped
1/3 cup niter kebbeh
2 cup garlic -- finely chopped
2 teaspoon fresh ginger root -- scraped
1  fine choppe
1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds -- freshly
1  ground
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg -- freshly
1  grated
1/4 cup paprika
2 teaspoon berbere or awaze
2/3 cup dry red wine
1/2 cup water
1 large firm ripe tomato *
2 teaspoon salt
3 pound lean boneless beef **
1  freshly ground black pepper

* coarsely chopped and pureed through a food mill or rubbed through a
sieve with a spoon. ** preferably chuck, trimmed of excess fat and
cut into 1-inch cubes.

In a heavy 4-5 qt. enameled casserole, cook the onions over moderate
heat for 5-6 minutes, until they are soft and dry. Slide the
casserole back and forth over the heat and stir the onions constantly
to prevent them from burning; if necessary, reduce the heat or remove
the casserole from the stove occasionally to let it cool for a few
moments before returning it to the heat.  Stir in the niter kebbeh
and when it begins to splutter, add the garlic, ginger, fenugreek,
cloves, allspice and nutmeg, stirring well after each addition. Add
the paprika and berbere, and stir over low heat for 2-3 minutes.

Stir in the wine, water, pureed tomato and salt, and bring the liquid
to a boil.  Add the beef cubes and turn them about with a spoon until
they are evenly coated with the sauce. Then reduce the heat to low.
Cover the pan partially and simmer the beef for about 1 1/2 hrs, or
until it shows no resistance when pierced with a few grindings of
pepper and taste for seasoning.

To serve, transfer the entire contents of the casserole to a deep
heated platter or bowl.  Sik sik wat is traditionally accompanied by
injera or spice bread, but may also be eaten with Arab-style flat
bread or hot boiled rice.  Yegomen kitfo and/or plain yoghurt may be
served with the wat from separate bowls.

little batter into skillet, swirling skillet to spread batter evenly
over bottom to make a thin coating. Sook until underside is golden,
then turn pancake out of pan (do not cook other side). Repeat with
remaining batter, adding more oil pan each time, to make 8 pancakes.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a saucepan. Add onion, ground beef, carrots,
parsnip and curry powder. Cook gently 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
Add tomato paste and mix well. Blend cornstarch with a little stock.

Sirloin Surprise

beef, low cal

4 tablespoon cheese; grated cheddar
2 tablespoon barbecue sauce; bull's eye spicy
4  butter lettuce leaves
1  parsley or cilantro sprigs
1 pound ground sirloin
4 teaspoon green onion; minced
1 teaspoon cavander's spice
8  cherry tomatoes

Select the leanest ground sirloin, or as I do, purchase a very lean
top sirloin steak and remove all visible fat and then grind at home.
(or use other type lean steak, where you cannot see any marbles of
fat in the meat). Mix the meat with the barbecue sauce and the cavander's
spice. Divide the meat into 4 portions and shape into balls. Make a
depression in the center of each ball, deep enough to hold 1 Tb of
the cheese and 1 teaspoon of the onion. Smooth the meat over the top of
the cheese, re-forming into an elongated ball shape. A little trick
is to wet your hands to smooth the meat, as you want to be sure the
cheese is well contained in the ball and will not seep out during
cooking. Place the meat on a rack over a roasting pan, in order to
let any fat drain off. Cook the meat in a 375 degree oven for 45
minutes to 1 hour. To serve: Place one cleaned leaf of the lettuce on
each plate, and top it with the meat. garnish with the tomatoes. I
like to stick the tomatoes with a toothpick, and push them into the
meat, and I also sometimes put a few parsley or cilantro sprigs on
the plate. It is easier to stay on a weight loss campaign if the food
looks appetizing.

Skewered Kidneys With Pistachio Butter

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
100 gm pistachio nuts
40 gm butter
3  cloves garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground cumin
1 pinch ground coriander
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch black pepper
1 pinch paprika
12  beef kidneys

The quantities for the pistachio butter make more than you will use
for this dish but keep the leftovers in the freezer for instant
pizazz on a simple steak.

In a dry frying pan, lightly roast until fragrant 100 g pistachio nut
kernels. Stir or shake frequently to ensure they do not burn.
Transfer to a food processor and add 40 g butter and 3 cloves garlic,
crushed. Process to a smooth paste, transfer to a piece of foil and
form into a roll. Wrap in foil and refrig- erate until needed.

Make a spice salt mixture by mixing 1 teaspoon salt with a pinch each
of ground cumin, ground coriander, ground nutmeg, black pepper and
paprika.

Skin and core 12 kidneys and thread the halves lengthways on 8
skewers, 3 halves to a skewer, to keep them open and flat. Brush with
oil. Heat a grill to maximum heat and grill the skew- ers close to
the heat for about a minute on each side.

Dust the kidneys with spiced salt on both sides and grill them for a
further minute on each side or until browned but still succulent.
Remove kidneys from the skewers to warmed plates, six halves per
person, and on each half(place as much pistachio butter as it will
hold. Serve immediately.

skillet brown the ground beef and onion; drain. Stire in soup,
enchilada sauce, milk and chilies. Reduce heat, cover and cook 20
minutes, stirring occasionally.

In a small skillet dip the tortillas in a little hot cooking oil just
till limp.  Drain.  Reserving 1/2 cup cheese, place 1/4 cup cheese on
each tortilla; sprinkle with olives. Roll up each tortilla. Place in
sauce; cover and cook till heated through, 5 minutes. Sprinkle with
treserved cheese; coverand cook till cheese metls, about 1 minutes.

Makes 4 servings.

Again, I got this recipe from the same Better Homes and Gardens "Easy
Skillet Meals" cookbook, but I make the following changes:

I use cream of celery soup, rather than the cream of mushroom, I use
whole sliced mushrooms, red peppers or jalepenos (whichever I have on
hand) and some diced onions and green peppers within the tortillas. I
also use Cheddar cheese instead of American and I tend to be a little
generous on the cheese.  I also put refried beans inside too.

Enjoy!

Sm Kttbullar (Small Swedish Meatballs)

appetizers, main dish, meats, swedish

1 tablespoon butter
4 tablespoon onion; finely chopped
1 large potato; bioled, mashed (1 c)
3 tablespoon bread crumbs; fine dry
1 pound ground beef; lean
1/3 cup cream; heavy
1 teaspoon salt
1  egg
1 tablespoon parsley; fine chopped (opt)
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
      ----SAUCE----
1 tablespoon flour
3/4 cup cream; light or heavy

In a small frying pan, melt 1 tb. of butter over moderate heat. When
the foam subsides, add the onions and cook for about 5 minutes, until
they are soft and translucent but not brown. In a large bowl, combine
the onions, mashed potato, bread crumbs, meat cream, salt, egg and
optional parsley. Knead vigorously with both hands or beat with a
wooden spoon until all of the ingredients are well blended and the
mixture is smooth and fluffy. Shape into small balls about 1" in
diameter. Arrange the meatballs in one layer on a baking sheet or flt
tray, cover with plastic and chill for at least 1 hour before
cooking. Over high heat, melt 2 tb. butter and 2 tb. oil in a heavy
skillet. When the foam subsides, add the meatballs, 8 to 10 at a
time. Reduce the heat to moderate and fry the balls on all sides,
shaking the pan almost constantly to roll them around in the hot fat
to help keep their shape. In 8 to 10 minutes the meatballs should be
brown outside and show no trace of pink inside when one is broken
open with a knife. Add more butter and oil to the skillet as needed
and transfer each finished batch to a casserole or baking dish and
keep warm in a 200øF. oven. If the meatballs are to be served as a
main course with noodles or potatoes, you may want to make a sauce
with the pan juices. Remove from the heat, pour off all fat from the
pan and stir in 1 tb. of flour. Quickly stir in 3/4 cup cream (light
or heavy) and boil over moderate heat for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring
constantly, until it is thick and smooth. Pour over meatballs and
serve. If the meatballs are to be served as an hors d'oeuvre or as
part of a smrgsbord, they should be cooked as above, but formed
into smaller balls and served without the sauce. Serves 6 to 8 or
about 50 meatballs.

Son Of Us Navy Minced Beef

beef

1 1/2 pound ground beef
2 medium onions, chopped
1  salt and pepper to taste
5 tablespoon flour, approximate
1  cooking oil, as needed
1 can whole tomatoes, dice, 16oz undraine; d
5 1/2 ounce tomatoes juice
2 cup hot water, approximate
1  ground nutmeg to taste
1  sugar to taste

Crumble the ground beef into a skillet and brown with the onions. If
beef is very lean, add a tablespoon or two of cooking oil. Salt and
pepper to taste. Add flour a tablespoon at a time, stirring and
cooking each spoonful, before adding the next. The flour must be
cooked to preclude a starchy taste through out. Add enough flour to
absorb the most of the oil.

Stir in the tomatoes and the tomato juice, followed by the water.
Allow to simmer on low heat to thicken. Adjust consistency as
necessary. This recipe should be your basic meat sauce in a gravy of
medium thickness.

Add nutmeg, about 1/2 teaspoon, and perhaps sugar, 1/2 teaspoon, to adjust
taste.
In the NAVY this is served over toast at breakfast. It's also great
on hot dogs!

Spaghetti Sauce (With Wine)

pasta, beef, italian

1 pound ground beef
1  onion -- chopped
2  to 3 cloves garlic -- minced
2  15-ounce cans tomato sauce
2  6-ounce cans tomato paste
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning -- or
1  more
1 dash ground oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1  or 2 glugs white wine

Brown the beef and onion in a huge skillet.  Add the garlic when the
beef is almost done.  Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste and all
the seasonings. Simmer over low heat while you cook the pasta. Like I
said, about 15 minutes before you're ready to serve, stir the wine
into the sauce.

I've never found it necessary to let spaghetti sauce cook for hours
and hours.  I don't have the time or the patience, and I like my
spaghetti sauce better than anything canned/jarred, or ordered in a
restaurant. It's got a richer taste, what with the amount of tomato
paste I use. Sometimes I use a can of stewed tomatoes in place of one
of the tomato sauces, but that's about the only variation I ever make.

2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoon flour
1 tablespoon hot dry mustard
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Cut ribs into sections of two bones each. Grease a pan with oil. Mix
together catsup, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix together
flour, mustard, chili powder, cloves, salt and pepper. Combine dry
and liquid mixtures with crushed pineapple. Lay meat in layers in a
pan, with some sauce in between, then top all with remaining sauce.

Bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour or until done.  Brown under broiler,
turning pieces over to brown both sides. Watch carefully and do not
allow sauce to burn. In fact, it's best to remove the sauce until
ribs are browned, and then spread it over the ribs after browning.

2 teaspoon ginger, ground; to 3 ts.
1/2 teaspoon ; salt
1/4 teaspoon ; pepper

1/4 cup sugar, brown; packed
1 teaspoon sauce, soy
1/8 teaspoon pepper, cayenne

peel briefly in boiling water, if desired. Finely chop peel, if
desired; set aside. Juice orange; set aside. In a small skillet,
simmer green onion 5 minutes over low heat in wine, vinegar and
stock. Strain well, discarding green onion; cool slightly. Place egg
yolks and wine mixture in a small enamel-lined saucepan. Place over
hot water or use a double-boiler. Water should be barely simmering at
any time. If mixture is over heated it will curdle and must be remade
from new ingredients. Add butter, one piece at a time, mixing well
and making sure each piece is fully incorporated before adding the
next. If desired use a whisk to beat butter into yolk mixture. When
all butter has been added, sauce should be fairly thick and creamy.
Add lemon juice, salt, white pepper, balnched orange peel and juice.
Fold in whipped cream before serving. Serve immediately to prevent
sauce from seperating. This sauce is delicious with delicate fish or
vegetable dishes, such as asparagus. It is also very good with
broiled meat. Makes 4 servings.

Standing Rib Roast With Herbed Crust

meats, beef

1  standing rib roast (7-8 pounds) (ab; 3 or 4 ribs)
1/2 cup fresh thyme leaves; chopped (reserve stems)
4  garlic cloves; peeled and cut into slive
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup ; water
2  to 3 tablespoons flour optional

Preheat oven to 475 degrees F.  Dry the roast thoroughly. Lightly
score the fat, then rub the whole roast with the reserved thyme
stems. Rub the face and underside of the roast with half of the
garlic slivers. Rub the whole roast with the pepper and salt. Pierce
the fat layer just enough to insert the remaining garlic slivers--do
not pierce into the flesh. Pat and press the thyme leaves into the
scored layer of fat. Place the roast bones down in a shallow roasting
pan just large enough to hold it comfortably. Insert a meat
thermometer in the top of the roast; make sure it is not touching
bone.

Roast for 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and
roast until done to your liking: 125-130 degrees for rare, 140-150
degrees for medium, and 160-165 degrees for well done. Count on
cooking times approximately as follows:  For rare, cooking time is
12-15 minutes per pound; medium, 15-18 per pound; well-done, 18-20
minutes per pound.

Remove the roast from the oven and place it on a carving board. Let it
stand, loosely covered with aluminum foil, for 15 minutes before
carving.

Meanwhile, skim all but a few tablespoons of fat from the juices in
the roasting pan.  Place the pan over medium heat; add 1/2 cup of the
water and stir to deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits clinging to
the bottom of the pan.  Add the remaining water.  This juice can be
served with the roast. For a flour based gravy, stir in the optional
flour until it browns before adding the 1/4 cup of water.

To carve, place on a carving board or platter, and cut away the bones.
Place the roast cut-side down on the board and carve into 1/2- to
3/4-inch-thick slices. Serves 6 to 8. Source: San Francisco Chronicle,

main dish, beef, british

      ----FILLING----
2 cup ground beef
1 teaspoon celery salt
1 teaspoon thyme
1  salt to taste
1  ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon dark soya sauce
      ----PASTRY----
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup ground suet
1 teaspoon white pepper

1. Add meat and filling spices to a large skillet. Cook thoroughly.

2. Discard oils that have been extracted during the cooking process.
Allow meat to become cold. Using warm or hot meat will adversely
effect the pastry shell.

3. Thoroughly mix all-purpose flour with suet. Do not use a
substitute for the suet - the results will not be acceptable. If the
suet is an extremely fine grind (powdery) use slightly less. The
consistency should be similar to that used in making Mince-meat. A
food processor may be utilized in making the dough.

4. Add cold water to the mixture, a little at a time. Continue to
blend together. A pea-sized consistency will be achieved then dough
will form into a ball. Allow to stand for 5-10 mins.

5. On a floured surface, roll out the pastry ball to obtain a sheet
approx 1/4" thick. Make (or find) a circular template that will gauge
the proper amount of pastry to fit into your pudding form.

Note: pudding forms come in a variety of sizes. Anything that will
stand up to being steamed, is approximately the size and shape of a
coffee mug, and has a lid, would be appropriate. Heat-resistent
plastic steaming cups with snap on covers are best.

6. Use the template to cut 4 pastry shells from the sheet. Gently
press these shells into the steaming cups so as to cover the bottom
and sides. Pleat where necessary to follow curve of the cup and allow
pastry to hang over the sides at the top.

6. Place approx 1/4 of the meat filling into each cup. Press the meat
down slightly in each cup so as to fill to within 1/4 in. of the top.

7. Re-work remaining pastry. Cut circles of dough slightly smaller
than the diameter of the snap on lid. This forms the cap of the
pastry shell. Joined to the pastry shell to the cap by pressed the
pastry together around the circumference and folding in the hanging
edges. A slightly thick cap is desired - although great excess should
be trimmed away. Snap on the lid, and place each steamed pudding into
the steaming device that you intend to use.

8. Steam for 25-30 minutes. Check at 20 min. to determine degree of
progress. The pastry should take on a slightly shiney look and be
firm to the touch when done. Puddings will stand up to overcooking.

9. Serve with a rich beef gravy, chips (French-fries), and peas.
Reconstituted dried green peas is the traditional vegetable.

Footnote: This recipe orginally contained diced beef and kidney as
the meat filling. Since few people seem to appreciate the kidney
ingredient, and considering that minced beef (hamburger meat) is an
economical alternative, this recipe was developed. The Steak and
Kidney Pudding is a widely recognized British dish.

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/2 cup drained stewed tomatoes

1. Cut top off each pepper and remove seeds and veins. Blanch in
boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and let cool. 2. In a
skillet, heat oil, add onion and garlic and saute for 4 to 5 minutes.
3. Add meat, salt, pepper and thyme and cook until meat is browned.
4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the meat, tomatoes, rice and
parsley. 5. Stuff each pepper with the meat mixture, place top back
on each and bake in a preheated 325 degree F. oven for 20 to 25
minutes.
*You may use yellow or red peppers as a substitute for eye appeal.
One of my favorite serving tricks to use green, red, yellow peppers
in this preparation. Then, use a large, well garnished platter for
the cooked peppers. If you use a creole type suace, the affect is
truely spectacular. **I have from time to time cut the peppers in
half lenghtwise in order to add plate coverage. This is especially
important if the peppers are small. It gives the appearence of
quantity with out the bulk. When I do this I increase the cooked rice
to 1 1/2 cups. Your mileage may vary!

Sur Le Gril Chopped Liver

meats

1 pound fresh calves' liver
2 tablespoon salad oil
3 tablespoon butter
1 each large spanish onion, chopped
1 each egg, hard-cooked, mashed
1 single salt
1 single freshly ground pepper

With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes from liver. In a heavy
skillet, heat oil and add chopped onions. Cook over medium high heat until
translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver pieces. Over medium
heat, fry liver until just done - 3 minutes on each side. Alternatively,
liver can be brushed with butter and broiled. To test for doneness, cut a
piece from liver slice. If still pink, continue cooking for 30 - 60
seconds. Overcooking causes the liver to be dry and tough. For finely
mashed egg that disappears in the liver mixture, force egg through a wire
strainer. For best results, separate the hard cooked whites from yolks and
sieve them separately. Set aside. Fit meat grinder with a medium blade and
place cooked liver and cooked onions in the grinder. Grind, then regrind
the ground mixture. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the twice ground meat
and onions mixture with the sieved eggs. Add salt and pepper. Taste and
adjust seasoning. If desired, add a few drops of commercial gravy browning
liquid to heighten color. Refrigerate for 24 hours before serving. Serve
with slices of tomato, cucumber and dark rye bread. Serves 4. By Sur Le

1  large head cabbage
1  salt and  pepper to taste
1 pound ground beef
1/3 cup milk
1/3 cup cracked wheat
1/2 cup brown sugar packed
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
3/4 cup tomato sauce
1  medium egg
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice

Carefully cut around cabbage core, and place head in boiling water for
about 10 minutes. Remove and let drain. This will make the cabbage leaves
limp  and easier to work with. When cabbage is cool enough to handle,
remove eight leaves. Meanwhile mix the ground beef with the cracked wheat,
mustard, egg, salt, and pepper, and milk. Divide mixture into eight equal
portions, place a portion on the stem end of each cabbage leaf, and roll
up. Ends of rolls can be trimmed and then tucked in. Place rolls seamed
sides down, in a circle in a three quart round microwaveable casserole. Mix
together the brown sugar, tomato sauce, and lemon juice. Pour mixture over
stuffed cabbage rolls. Cover casserole tightly and microwave on high for 7
to 10 minutes.     Check for doneness. Be careful not to overcook as
cabbage leaves can become tough. Makes four servings.

Taco Take-Out Filling

meats, beef, ethnic

2 pound ground chuck
1 cup onion -- chop
1  green pepper -- chop
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
3 tablespoon beef bouillon powder -- or
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon Tabasco
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 1/2 cup bottled chili sauce
1/3 cup sweetpickle relish
1 small can tomato paste
6 ounce water tomato paste can
3 tablespoon dark molasses
10 1/2 ounce beef broth
1  hot fried taco shells
1  lettuce -- shred
1  monterey jack cheese-grate

Pack beef into ungreased 10" skillet on medium heat. Cover and let
simmer, reducing to low heat after 5 minutes. You don't really want
to overbrown the beef, but to allow some moisture to combine with the
natural fat in the chuck to create a broth while it simmer. Depending
on the percentage of fat content in the beef, I'd let it steam like
this for about 12-15 minutes. Turn off heat. Drain liquid from beef
into blender with HALF of the beef. With on/off speed blend this
mixture until it resembles a brick-layer's mortar. To the mixture of
pulvarized beef and the remaining half which you did not put into the
blender, add onion, green pepper, mustard seed, bouillon powder and
chili powder. Stir in hotpepper sauce, cumin powder, chili sauce,
sweet pickle relish, tomato paste, water, molasses and beef broth.
(If you like a thinner sauce, add more beef broth). Simmer this
uncovered, stirring frequently to prevent scorching or use your slow
cooker on "high" for about 2 hours. On top of the range, simmer 1
hour, adding additional liquid as necessary tokeep sauce consistency.
Spoon it into the fried taco shells. Top it off  with lettuce, grated
cheese and Taco 5 Alarm Sauce. Source: Gloria Pitzer Presents The

Tender Jerky

makemeat, game

10 pound deer, elk, moose, etc., ground
2/3 cup curing sugar or curing salt in a pi; nch
1 teaspoon cardamom
1 teaspoon marjoram
1 tablespoon msg
1 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoon black pepper
3 tablespoon liquid smoke
2 tablespoon water
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Begin preparation by deboning and removing the tendons and fat from the
meat. It is important that you remove all fat or it will go rancid. Either
grind the meat yourself or have someone grind it for you; a coarse grind
gives the best results. Mix the spices thoroughly and then add the spices a
bit at a time while kneading the meat like dough. Put the meat in the
fridge for at least 6 hours to allow the spices to work through the meat.
At this point you prepare the meat for jerking. If you have an electric
meat slicer, make the meat into logs about 4 x 14"; place the meat in the
fridge until it is solid but not frozen, and then slice 1/8" slices from
end to end. You'll end up with a big stack of circular patties. If you
don't have a slicer, roll the meat out to a 1/8" thickness between two
pieces of wax paper. Remove the top paper and score the meat into strips
and place them in the freezer for about 45 minutes. Remove the meat and
break at the score marks. Place the jerky on wire racks and place them in a
150 F. oven, leaving the door ajar so moisture can escape and the heat does
not build up.  Turn the jerky once or twice during drying and rotate the
racks if the jerky near the elements begins to dry too fast. Meat should be
left slightly pliable, that should take somewhere around 3 or 4 hours to
get to.  Cure yours to whatever point you like; if you like potato chips,
be my guest. Jerky can can be stored for months in the freezer; the drier
it is the longer it lasts. Makes 1 happy camper.

Tex-Mex Style Enchiladas

meats, tex mex

2 pound ground beef, extra-lean (as little; fat as possible)
2 medium onions, chopped
4 tablespoon flour
2 1/2 cup enchilada sauce (2 standard cans)
1 pound Cheddar cheese, sharp, grated

PREPARE SAUCE AND FILLING:  Brown ground beef and 1 chopped onion in a
large skillet. There should be enough fat in the beef to eliminate any need
for extra oil and also to saute the onions at the same time. While you are
browning the beef (it should be completely cooked with no pink or red color
left), be sure to break it up so that it is granular in texture, as opposed
to chunky, when completely browned. Onions should be limp and translucent
but not brown.

Add about 4 tablespoon  of flour and saute until flour is completely
incorporated
into the meat mixture. Add the enchilada sauce. Heat over low heat. If the
mixture is too thick, add a little water.  The consistency should be that
of a thick gravy, but not soupy. Simmer over low heat for 20-30 minutes.

PREPARE ROLLED ENCHILADAS:  Rolled enchiladas are tougher to assemble, but
more authentic.  Have ready a large baking pan, we always use an oblong
Pyrex pan. One at a time, dip each tortilla in the enchilada sauce just
enough to coat and slightly soften. Lay the tortilla flat in the baking
pan, spoon about 3 tablespoon of the enchilada sauce in a line down the
middle, top
with about 1 teaspoon chopped onion and about 3 tablespoon of grated
cheese.

Roll the tortilla tightly into a cylinder with the seam on the bottom, and
position against the bottom edge of the baking pan. Repeat until the pan is
full. This can get tricky (but it is possible) as the pan gets full.
Assembling the enchilada outside of the pan is usually a messy disaster.
Depending on the size of the pan and how tightly each enchilada is rolled,
you can get 8-12 enchiladas in a pan. This recipe should make about 16-24
enchiladas.

Spoon enchilada sauce over the assembled enchiladas to thinly cover.
Sprinkle generously with grated cheese. Bake at 425 degrees F. for 20
minutes.

PREPARE STACKED ENCHILADAS:  This is the New Mexico style.  It is much
easier to assemble. Have plates ready. One at a time, submerge each
tortilla in the enchilada sauce (which should be cooking on low heat during
this process) and cook until limp but not falling apart, this may take a
little practice to gauge the time.

Remove the tortilla from the sauce and place flat on a plate.  Spoon a
little sauce, including meat, over the tortilla, add about 1 tablespoon
chopped
onion and about 4 tablespoon grated cheese. Repeat the process until you
have a
stack of 3-4 tortillas on a plate, depending on the appetite of the person
who will eat them. Top the last tortilla with a generous amount of sauce
and cheese. Serve immediately.

The fundamental difference between these two styles is the method used to
cook the tortillas. In the rolled style, the sauce is cooked into the
tortilla through the baking process. In the stacked style, the tortilla is
cooked directly in the sauce. Only the appearance differs, the taste is the
same with either style.

NOTES:

*  Central Texas style Mexican enchiladas -- We cook beef enchiladas in two
ways, the traditional rolled enchilada and the easier-to-cook New Mexico
stacked style.  Both procedures are given.  Also, we used to cook the
enchilada sauce/chili from scratch but more recently began using a shortcut
with canned Old El Paso brand enchilada sauce, since it is not only faster
(20 minutes vs. 4+ hours) but also has a very authentic spice combination.
Yield: Serves 6-8.

*  I always use Old El Paso canned enchilada sauce, though it is possible
to make your own.

Tex-Mex Style Tacos

meats, tex mex

2 pound ground beef, extra-lean
1 medium onion, chopped fine
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon chile powder (or more to taste)
1  vegetable oil
12  corn tortillas (the thinner the bet; ter)
1/2 pound Cheddar cheese, sharp, grated
1 large tomato, chopped
3 cup shredded lettuce

Brown the ground beef and chopped onion in a large skillet.  There should
be enough fat in the beef to eliminate any need for extra oil and also to
saute the onions at the same time. While you are browning the beef (it
should be completely cooked with no pink or red color left), be sure to
break it up so that it is granular in texture, as opposed to chunky, when
completely browned. Onions should be limp and translucent but not brown.

Drain off as much fat as possible.  Add salt and  chile powder and continue
to saute until the chile is completely incorporated into the meat mixture.
Cover skillet and leave on extremely low heat, just enough to keep the meat
hot.

Put about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a small skillet, and heat it. Test
the oil for proper temperature by putting in a small piece of tortilla.
When the oil reaches the temperature where it immediately begins to bubble
frantically over the tortilla as soon as it is put in the oil and the
tortilla piece becomes crisp quite quickly, you are ready to cook the taco
shells.  This is important because there is nothing worse than a soggy taco
shell (which results from the oil not being hot enough).

Using tongs, put the tortillas in the oil, one at a time,  and cook for
30-60 seconds until the underside just starts to become crisp. With the
tongs, turn the tortilla over and, using a spatula, bend in half to form
the shell. Cook each side of the bent tortilla until crisp, about 30-45
seconds per side. Remove the shell from the oil and drain on a
newspaper-covered cookie sheet. The cooked shells can be kept warm in the
oven at very low heat.

To assemble, fill each shell about 2/3s full of the meat and top with
cheese, tomato and lettuce. We like to add extra zap with a shot of Tabasco
sauce.

NOTES:

*  San Antonio, Texas style tacos -- My dad is from east Texas and my mom
from southern Oklahoma, but they developed their definition of Tex-Mex from
several years in San Antonio. Since they now live in D.C., they feel
extremely deprived, none of the chain restaurants come anywhere near the
taste they developed in San Antonio.

Tex-Mex cooking is based on peasant-style dishes from the areas of Mexico
bordering Texas.  The primary ingredients of Tex-Mex cooking are corn
tortillas (the thinner the better), ground beef, pinto beans and hot chile
powder, sharp Cheddar cheese and onions.  Yield:  1 dozen tacos.

*  Don't try to use instant onion in this recipe.  In San Antonio, people
consider that the best chile  powder is Gebhardt's or Eagle Brand.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes.

The Falls City Carbonade

beef, roast

1  beef rump roast, 3 to 3-1/2
1  pounds (see step 1)
4 tablespoon beef suet or vegetable oil
1  salt and freshly ground
1  black pepper to taste
2 tablespoon butter
4  onions, sliced
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoon cider vinegar
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/4 cup beer
3 cup brown soup stock (see topic
1  3) or bouillon
2  ribs celery, cut in half
2  carrots, peeled and cut in
1  half
2  sprigs parsley
2  bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 tablespoon butter, at room temperature
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour

In the late nineteenth and the early decades of our own time, many German
families settled in the Ohio Valley around Louisville, and they brought
their food and brewery talents with them. In many ways our food
preferences reflect this influence. Most of our food today is lighter and
fresher, but the old flavors linger on - one of which is this beef cooked
in beer. Cook it ahead, heat it up, prepare some noodles and broccoli or
kohrabi - it works like a charm.

1. Have your butcher slice the roast into 12 to 14 slices.

2. Melt the suet, if using, in a 400 degree oven while you flatten the
slices of beef a bit with the flat side of a mallot. Then reduce the heat
to 325 degrees.

3. Heat the suet or vegetable oil in a large iron skillet over medium
heat. Saute the slices of meat, a few at a time, in the fat until they
have browned lightly on both sides. Be careful not to burn the fat. Season
the meat with salt and pepper. Transfer the slices of meat as they brown
to another pan to keep warm.

4. Add 2 Tbsp. butter to the skillet and blend it with the brown
crustiness from the beef. Add the onions and water. Cook until the onions
absorb the butter and meat juices somewhat. Season with salt.

5. Layer the meat and onions in a casserole or dutch oven, ending with a
top layer of meat.

6. Combine the vinegar, sugar, and beer in the skillet and deglaze over
medium heat. Stir well and pour over the meat and onions.

7. Add enough beef stock or bouillon to cover the meat well. If there is
not enough, add some water. Add the celery, carrots, parsley, bay leaves,
and thyme.

8. Cover, and cook in the oven for 1-1/2 hours. Then blend together the
softened butter and flour and whisk it into the meat juices. Season with
salt and pepper to taste. Cover and continue to cook until the meat is
exquisitely tender and the juices have thickened. This may take another 30
minutes, depending upon the quality of the meat. Discard the seasoning
vegetables and herbs.

The Sheet - La Sabana

mexican, beef

1  jim vorheis
6 ounce slice filet mignon, about 1 1/2 to; 3 inches wide
1/8 teaspoon fresh lime juice, approximately
1  sea salt
1  freshly ground pepper

Place the beef between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound, pushing
it outward as you go, to a rough oval shape. Fold into a package and
pound out again to the required size. Peel off the top plastic wrap
and replace with wax paper.  Turn meat over and replace second sheet
of plastic with wax paper; set aside until ready to use.

Heat a griddle.  When very hot, grease lightly. Remove top paper.
Sprinkle the exposed side of the meat with lime juice and salt and
pepper and lay it face down, with the aid of the paper, on the
griddle. Strip off the bottom paper.  Cook for about 2 seconds, flip
the meat over with two spatulas so it will not break in the middle,
and cook for 2 seconds more. Serve immediately, flat if possible, on
a large plate with refried beans, and fresh salsa of your choice.

The World's Finest Leg Of Lamb

meats

1  4 1/2 pound leg of lamb
3  cloves
1  garlic
1  olive oil
1  black pepper, ground
6  fresh rosemary sprigs

Trim the excess fat on the meat, but leave a thin layer. Make 1"
slits all over the meat, and insert a slice of garlic into each slit.
Rub well with a liberal coating of olive oil, and then coat heavily
with salt and pepper. Wrap securely with plastic wrap, and
refrigerate for at least several hours ~ the longer, the better!

Preheat the oven to 500F. Heat an oven-proof skillet large enough to
hold the lamb comfortably. Remove the lamb to a platter, and pour off
all but 1 tablespoon. olive oil. Cover the bottom of the pan with the
rosemary. Place the lamb on top, and cover the lamb with more
rosemary. Place in the oven, and reduce oven temperature to 375F
after 20 minutes. Roast 40 minutes longer. To serve: take the lamb,
in its pan, outside. Ignite the rosemary on the top of the lamb.
Allow the fire to burn itself out. Brush off the woody stems. Let
rest 10-15 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, and enjoy!

Thit Bo Vien (Beef Balls)

appetizers, beef, vietnamese

5 tablespoon nuoc mam (vietnamese fish sa uce)
4 teaspoon potato starch
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon sugar, granulated
1 teaspoon pepper, black, ground
2 pound trimmed boneless beef hind s hank
4  garlic cloves; crushed
1 teaspoon oriental sesame oil
1  vegetable oil, for shaping m eatbal; ls

In a shallow dish, mix the fish sauce, potato starch, baking
powder, sugar and black pepper.
Slice the meat into 1/8-inch-thick pieces. Add to the mari-
nade and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or
overnight.
Before proceeding, transfer the meat to the freezer for 30
minutes.
Work with half of the beef at a time; do not overload the work
bowl. In a food processor, combine half of the beef with half of the
garlic and sesame oil. Process to a completely smooth but stiff
paste, about 3 minutes. Stop occasionally to scrape  down the sides
of the work bowl. The completed paste should spring back to the
touch. Transfer the paste to a bowl. Process  the remaining beef,
garlic and sesame oil the same way.
Rub some vegetable oil on one hand. Grab a handful of the meat
paste and close your hand into a fist, squeezing out a small portion
of the mixture, about 1 teaspoon, between your thumb and index
finger. Keep rolling and resqueezing the same portion between your
thumb and index finger until you obtain a smooth rounded ball. Scoop
out the meatball with an oiled spoon. Repeat until all of the paste
is used.
Pour 1 inch of water into a wok or wide pot. Place a steamer
rack or bamboo steamer over the water. Arrange the meatballs without
crowding in a single layer on the rack. Cover and steam for 5 minutes.
Serve as an appetizer with chili sauce. These beef balls can
also be added to a well-seasoned beef broth, sprinkled with chopped
scallions and black pepper and served as a soup (noodles may be
added).
Note: These meatballs may be frozen. Thaw them thoroughly, then
steam or simmer in boiling water until just heated through.
Yield: about 60 meatballs.

Thoroughly Modern Meatloaf

beef, microwave

1 pound ground beef; (more or less)
3 slice bread, to 4 sliced
1  onion; peeled & quartered
2 tablespoon parsley, dried
1 teaspoon spearmint, dried
1  garlic clove
1/4 teaspoon olive oil; for flavor
1  salt and pepper; to taste
2 tablespoon feta; crumbled (more or less to
1  egg; (optional, use less bread

Tear the bread into a food processor bowl. Pulse until it becomes
crumbs. Toss in the onion, garlic, oil and spices. Pulse to blend and
chop. Add the meat and cheese as small hunks. Process until it forms
a ball that rolls around in the processor bowl. If using the egg, add
it along with the meat or after processing the meat a bit, but before
it forms a ball. Place the meat into a microwave loaf pan. (I use a
pan made for the purpose that has a shelf which holds the meat up out
of the fat.) Micro-cook at 70% for 10 to 15 minutes. Check for
doneness with the instant thermometer (160 F.). I use a turntable. If
you don't have one, you will need to rotate the pan two or three
times during cooking. Slice thin, and serve with yogurt cucumber
dressing (tzatziki), though my husband prefers catsup.

Try eating this on hash-brown potatoes instead of toast or biscuits,
it makes all the difference in the world.

Use a coarse cheese grater to grate one medium potato per person. Fry
'em up in a little butter. No salt needed because they're going to be

Uno's Deep Pan Pizza

meats, italian, pizza

      ----CRUST----
1 cup warm tap  water (110-115ø)
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
3 1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup coarse ground cornmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil
      ----FILLING----
1 pound mozzarella, sliced
1 pound sausage, removed from the
1  casing and crumbled
1 can whole tomatos, drained and
1  coarsely crushed
2 cup cloves, peeled and minced
3 teaspoon dried oregano,or
5  fresh basil leaves,
1  shredded
4 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan
1  cheese

Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve the yeast
with a fork. Add 1 cup of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt, and, and
vegetable oil. Mix well with a spoon. Continue stirring in the rest
of the flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes away from the
sides of the bowl. Flour your hands and the work surface and kneed
the ball of dough until it is no longer sticky.

Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic wrap, for 45
to 60 minutes in a warm place, until it is doubled in bulk. Punch it
down and kneed it briefly. Press it into an oiled 15-inch deep dish
pizza pan, until it comes 2 inches up the sides and is even on the
bottom of the pan. Let the dough rise 15-20 minutes before filling.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Cook the crumbled
sausage until it is no longer pink, drain it of it's excess fat.
Drain and chop the tomatos.

When the dough has finished its second rising, lay the cheese over the
dough shell. Then distribute the sausage and garlic over the cheese.
Top with the tomatos. Sprinkle on the seasonings and Parmesan cheese.

Bake for 15 minutes at 500 degrees. Then lower the temperature to 400
degrees and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up a section of the
crust from time to time with a spatula to check on its color. The
crust will be golden brown when done. Serve immediately.

Upper Michigan Pasties

meats

      ----CRUST----
2 cup flour
1/2 cup shortening
1/4 cup lard
1/4 cup scraped suet
1  water
      ----FILLING----
1 1/4 pound beef, coarsely ground
4 medium potatoes, diced
1 large onion, chopped
1/4 cup rutabaga (swede), diced
1  carrot, diced
1  salt and pepper

Put the flour in a bowl and cut in the shortening, lard and suet. Add just
enough water to make a soft dough.  Divide the dough into four parts and
roll out each piece into a circle about the size of a dinner plate.

Crumble the meat into a bowl and stir in the potatoes, onion, rutabaga and
carrot.  Divide the mixture into four parts, putting some on one side of
each piece of dough. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.

Fold the pastry over the filling to make half-moon shaped pies.  Seal the
edges and cut a couple of small slits on the top.  Bake on a cookie sheet
at 375 degrees F. for 30 to 35 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F.
and bake 15 more minutes.

NOTES:

*  Cornish-style meat pies from the UP -- The pasty (PAH-stee) is a kind of
English meat pie.  It was brought to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan by
Cornish miners in the mid-nineteenth century.  The UP version differs
slightly from the original Cornish pasty in that it has more vegetables and
less meat and crust.

You can eat pasties hot, warm, or cold.  If you wrap them in aluminum foil
when they come out of the oven, they'll keep warm for hours. Or, you can
refrigerate/freeze them and reheat them later.  (Maybe the original "fast
food?")

*  Most people who live in the UP don't bother to make their own pasties;
they buy them from bakeries and pasty shops (which are as common as
hamburger joints are in other parts of the country). As a former resident,
though, sometimes I get homesick and resort to making them myself. This is
the recipe my mother sent me.

*  These have a high cholesterol content.  I've tried using an ordinary
vegetable-shortening pie crust, but it invariably turns out too dry and
crumbly to hold together.  (Authentic UP pasties have a crust that's thin,
moist, and somewhat chewy, not a flaky crust.)  If anyone has any ideas,
I'd love to hear about them. You can also cook the filling by itself in a
casserole dish if you're feeling lazy about making the crust.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the crust ingredients.

"It's fun to watch the 'crust' rise while this unique casserole is

Veal Scaloppine With Marsala

meats, european

1/2 pound scallopine of veal, cut
1  into 1/4 inch slices
1  flour for dredging
1  salt
1  freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup marsala wine

Unless the scaloppine are very small, cut them into pieces measuring ab. 3
in. by 3 in or slightly larger.  Place them between sheets of wax paper and
pound lightly to flatten.(use a rolling pin, bottom of a heavy skillet,
pounder, etc.) Blend flour with salt and pepper to taste. Dip the meat into
flour to coat lightly. Using a large, heavy skillet, heat the butter and
oil and when it is very hot but not brown, add the meat in one layer. Cook
over relatively high heat until golden brown on one side. Turn and cook
until golden brown on the other. The cooking time should be from 4-6 min.
Transfer meat to a serving platter or two plates and keep warm. To the
skillet add the wine and stir to dissolve the particles in the pan. Reduce
wine slightly and pour equal amounts over each serving. Naturally, these
amts. may be increased to serve more people. For Chicken marsala, I don't
see why you can't substitute chicken breasts.

Veal Scaloppine With Marsala Wine

meats

2 pound veal scaloppine
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  salt and freshly ground pepp
3/4 cup dry marsala wine; or sherry

Recipe by: lrao@ICSI.Net (Luke Rao) Place scaloppine between 2 pieces
of waxed paper and pound until thin. When pounding meat do not use a
straight up-and-down movement. Use a sliding action so meat is
stretched more than flattened.  Place scaloppine on aluminum foil.
Coat meat lightly with flour.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt 3
tablespoons butter with oil in a large heavy skillet. When butter
foams, add veal. Cook over high heat about 1 minute on each side.
Veal should be light golden outside and pink inside. Remove veal from
skillet. Add 1 tablespoon butter and Marsala or sherry.  Deglaze
skillet by stirring to dissolve meat juices attached to bottom of
skillet. When wine is reduced by half, return veal to skillet. Mix
gently with sauce.  Place meat on a warm platter. Spoon sauce over
meat.  Serve immediately.

Veal Stifado

main dish, meats, greek

2 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 pound lean veal; in 1-1/2 cubes
2  garlic cloves
1  salt and freshly ground pepper
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoon dry red wine
3  peeled tomatoes; chopped
1 large bay leaf
1 tablespoon white or brown sugar
1 1/2 pound small white onions; peeled
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoon butter; cut into bits
1  cinnamon stick
3  whole cloves

In a baking-serving casserole, heat the oil, then add the veal and
saute on all sides.  Add the garlic and season with salt and pepper.
Stir with a wooden spoon, then add the vinegar, wine, tomatoes, bay
leaf, sugar, and enough water to cover the veal.  Arrange the onions
over the meat, sprinkle the parsley and butter bits over the top, and
slip the spices in between the meat and the onions.  Shake the
casserole a few times, then cover with an inverted plate to keep in
place and cover tightly with a lid (using a little flour-water paste
around the inside of the lid to seal if you wish). Bake in a slow
oven (300 F) for 2 to 2-1/2 hours or over minimum heat on a burner,
until the veal and onions are tender. Remove from the heat and serve
warm. Note: After peeling the onions, pierce the root end of each
onion with the tip of a small, sharp knife, then slash again at a
right angle to make a cross. This will keep the onion whole and
intact during the cooking process.

2  celery stalks  cut into 4 pieces
1 tablespoon finely minced garlic
2 tablespoon tomato paste
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup dry white wine
5 cup all-purpose stock or low-sodium chi; cken broth

PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Pat the meat dry and sprinkle with salt and
pepper as desired. Heat the oil in a large covered casserole or Dutch
oven over high heat on top of the stove. Add the meat, without
crowding, in batches if necessary, and brown well on all sides.
Remove pieces to a plate as they are done and reserve. Repeat until
all meat is browned. Pour off any remaining fat, and replace the
casserole over medium heat. Add the onion, half the carrots, celery,
garlic and tomato paste. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Use
your spoon to loosen and dissolve the brown bits stuck to the bottom
of the casserole. Add flour and cook, stirring, an additional minute.

Replace the meat (and any juices on the plate) in the casserole and
add the stock, peppercorns and thyme. Cover, bring to a boil and
place in the oven for 1 1/4-to-1 1/2 hours, or until meat is tender.
Meanwhile, combine potatoes, remaining carrots and butter with 1/2
cup of water in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook for 5
minutes. Add the turnips and cook, stirring occasionally, until all
water is evaporated, leaving the vegetables bathed in butter, about
another 5 minutes. Add the peas, remove from the heat and set aside.
Remove the casserole from the oven. Using a slotted spoon, remove the
meat from the sauce and place it in a bowl. Pour the sauce through a
fine strainer into another bowl and discard the vegetables and spices
that remain in the strainer. Replace meat in the pot, add the cooked
vegetables and the sauce. Cover and place over medium heat for 5
minutes. Serve piping hot.
