1. Preheat oven to 225°F. Lightly oil a large baking sheet with sides or coat it with nonstick spray.

2. Cut fresh tomatoes in half lengthwise. Arrange, cut-side down, in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with sugar. Roast for 3 hours, or until very soft and wrinkled. Let cool and set aside.

3. Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven or soup pot, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil and dried chilies (or crushed red pepper) over medium-low heat. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add paprika and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute more.

4. Add canned tomatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.

5. Strain soup into a bowl; transfer solids to a food processor or blender. Puree until smooth, adding a little broth if necessary. Return puree and broth to pot. Whisk to combine.

6. Using a food mill, puree reserved roasted tomatoes. (Alternatively, slip off skins, puree in a food processor and strain through a coarse sieve.) Add puree to soup. (If the soup is too thick, add a little of the reserved canned tomato liquid.) Season with salt and pepper.

7. If using shrimp, cook in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until they just turn pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and let cool. Peel shrimp and cut in half lengthwise.

8. Ladle into warmed soup bowls and garnish with shrimp, if using, and chives (or basil). Serve immediately, with Garlic Crostini.

   2      medium        red bell peppers
   1                    jalapeno chili
     1/3  cup           lowfat sour cream
     1/2  teaspoon      sugar
   1      pound         sole or other lean fish
          fillets       
   4      cups          bite-size pieces salad greens

Set oven control to broil. Place bell peppers on rack in broiler pan. 
Broil about 5 inches from heat 12 to 16 minutes, turning occasionally, 
until skin is blistered and evenly browned. Place peppers in plastic bag: 
close tightly. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes. Peel peppers; remove stem, 
seeds and membranes.
Hold jalapeno chili over range-top burner, using long-handled fork. Turn 
frequently until skin is blistered and evenly browned. Place chili in 
plastic bag; close tightly. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes. Peel chili; remove 
stem, seeds and membranes.
Place peppers and chili in blender or food processor. Cover and blend or 
process until smooth. Stir in sour cream and sugar.
Set oven control to broil. Cut fish fillets into 4 serving pieces. Place 
on rack in broiler pan. Broil with tops about 4 inches from heat 5 to 6 
minutes or until fish flakes easily with fork (do not turn). Place salad 
greens on 4 serving plates. Top with fish. Serve with sauce. 4 SERVINGS 
(WITH ABOUT 1/4 CUP SAUCE EACH).
NOTE:  Both bell and jalapeno peppers can be roasted under the broiler or 
over a range-top flame. Due to the difference in size, it's not efficient 
to roast them together under the broiler. Brown the jalapenos over a 
burner while the bells broil, then toss them into the plastic bag 
together. Always use care when handling hot chilies; rubber gloves can be 
very helpful.
