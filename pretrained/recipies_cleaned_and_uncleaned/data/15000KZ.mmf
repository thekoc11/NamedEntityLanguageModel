      6 c  Whole-wheat flour
      1 tb Honey
      1 tb Active dry yeast
      2 c  Water; very warm (120)
 
  Recipe by: McDougall In a large bowl, mix 2 cups flour and yeast. Mix

  make soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured board. Knead until
  smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes, adding more flour if it is
  too sticky. Place in bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until
  doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, turn onto lightly
  floured board. Cover, let rest 30 minutes. Divide dough into 10 equal
  pieces. Shape each into a ball. On a lightly floured board, roll each
  ball into a 6 inch circle. Place on a lightly floured baking sheet.
  Bake on bottom rack of preheated 450 degree oven. Bake about 5
  minutes. Tops will not be brown. To brown tops, place under broiler 3
  inches from heat, for 1 minute. From the collection of Sue Smith,

      Title: POCKET SOUP - GOLDBECK
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 18 Servings
 
      2 tb Split peas, dried
      2 tb Cracked wheat
    1/4 c  Dehydrated vegetable flakes
           ;(soup greens)
      2 ts Sesame seeds
      2 ts Sunflower seeds
      1 ts Nutritional yeast
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Grind split peas, cracked wheat, vegetable flakes and seeds in blender
  until they are a fine powder. Combine ground mixture with yeast and
  salt. Store in a covered container at room temperature. To use, add 1
  heaping teaspoon soup mix to 6 ounces of boiling water, or 2 level
  teaspoons to 1 cup boiling water. Stir, let sit a few minutes, and
  serve. Makes 3/4 Cup dried soup mix - enough for 18 cups of soup.
  Note: this is one of those times when a blender seems to do a much
  more efficient job than the food processor. Note 2: Those who enjoy
  an instant cup of broth but are dismayed by the use of flavor
  enhancers and the abundance of salt in commercial brands may welcome
  the chance to make their own soup mix.

           -VIVIAN THIELE NRHF19C
 
  The following recipes are additional spreads that can be used in
  place of butter on the outside of bread/dough when making pockets.
  
  Mayo Spread: 1/4 cup real Mayonnaise; 1/4 tsp. onion powder; 1/4 tsp.
  celery salt.  Stir to combine. Enough for 8 slices of bread. Mayo
  spread will enhance the flavor of most foods except sweets.
  Especially good on sandwiches with eggs, cheese, ham and seafood or
  vegetable pockets.
  
  Curried Mayonnaise: 1/4 cup mayonnaise; 1 tsp. mild Indian curry
  powder. Stir to combine - enough for 8 slices of bread. Curry is a
  nice flavor accompaniment with beef, chicken, lamb, shrimp and
  vegetables.
  
  Maple butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/2 tsp. maple flavoring.
  Stir to combine. Enough for 8 slices. Use maple butter for pockets.
  Use with pork, ham or sweets.
  
  Vanilla butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/2 tsp vanilla
  extract. Stir to combine - enough for 8 slices of bread. Vanilla
  butter enhances flavor and has an enticing aroma while cooking.
  
  Almond Butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/4 tsp almond extract.
  Stir to combine - enough for 8 slices bread. Use with fruit pie
  filling or other sweets.
  
  Herbed butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1/4 tsp herbs
  (combine basil, thyme, rosemary and tarragon). Stir to combine.
  Spread on one side of 8 bread slices or other bread products used for
  pockets. This taste especially good with meats, cheese and vegetables.
  
  Garlic butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1 clove garlic,
  crushed. Stir to combine.  Enough for 8 bread slices. Use with any
  eat or vegetable filling.
  
  Honey butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1 tblsp. honey. Stir
  to combine.  This is enough to spread 8 slices of bread. Because the
  honey promotes browning, use this on pockets which only have to brown
  and heat through.  If used on egg sandwiches,etc... the bread may
  over brown before the egg finishes cooking.
  
  Lemon butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; finely grated rind of
  1 lemon (about 1/2tsp.).  Stir to combine. This is enough to spread 8
  slices of bread. The fresh lemon brings out the flavor of fruit
  filling and seafood fillings.

  cuts; pinch edges to completely seal. Cover; let rise in warm place
  30 to 40 minutes or until light and almost doubled in size.
  
  Heat oven to 375 degrees. Uncover dough. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes or
  until loaves are deep golden brown and sound hollow when lightly
  tapped. Immediately remove from pans; cool on wire racks.

      Title: POINTERS FOR MAKING LEMON SNOW
 Categories: Tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See below
 
  + Remember to remove the zest from the lemon before squeezing its
  juice.
  
  + The temperature and consistency of the gelatin mixture is crucial to
  achieving a fine foam that will not separate on chilling. To prevent
  separation, beat only when the mixture is thick enough and mounds when
  dropped from a spoon. If too thick, it will not form a fine foam. If
  the gelatin mixture begins to set before beating, briefly place the
  bowl over a bowl of hot water and stir constantly until gelatin
  begins to soften. Set the bottom of the bowl directly in cold water
  to stop the heating immediately.
  
  + The sauce mixture must be heated to at least 160 degrees to thicken
  and prevent thinning out on setting. However, for a silky- smooth
  sauce that does not curdle, the mixture must not be allowed to boil.

      Title: POISSON CRU
 Categories: Tahiti, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Halibut; skinned - boneless
           -- 1 1/2" thick Or:
      2 lb Tuna steaks; fresh - cut
           1-1/2" thick
      1 c  Lime juice; fresh
    1/2 c  Onions; coarsely chopped
      2 ts Salt
      3 ea Tomatoes *
    1/2 c  Scallions; coarsely chopped
           -include 2" green tops
    1/4 c  Green bell peppers;
           -chopped
      2 ea Eggs; hard-cooked
           -chopped
      1 c  Cocoanut top milk; rich
           -chilled
 
  * Tomatoes should be medium-sized, firm, ripe, stemmed, peeled and
  coarsely chopped. Chill the halibut or fresh tuna steaks briefly in
  the freezer in order to firm the meat and make it easier to cut, but
  do not let the fish freeze completely. With a cleaver or large, sharp
  knife, cut the steaks lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices, then cut each
  slice into pieces 1 1/2 inch square.
      In a deep bowl, mix the lime juice, onions and salt together.
  Drop in the fish and turn it about with a spoon until the strips are
  evenly coated. Cover and marinate at room temperature for at least 2
  hours, or in the refrigerator for 3 or 4 hours, stirring the fish
  occasionally.
      When done, the fish will be opaque and fairly firm, indicating
  the it is fully "cooked". Taste to make sure; if it seems underdone,
  marinate the fish for an hour or so longer.
      To serve, drain the fish and squeeze it slightly to remove all the
  excess moisture. Place the fish is a serving bowl, add the tomatoes,
  scallions, green peppers and hard cooked eggs and cocoanut milk and
  toss them all together gently but thoroughly. Note: The term poisson
  cru means raw fish. The recipe itself is similar to the civiche
  popular in many Latin American countries which "cooks" fish in a
  marinade of lime or lemon juice seasoned with onions, garlic and hot
  chilies. Source: Time-Life Books Foods of the World, Pacific and

      Title: POLENTA
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 c  Water
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Polenta (coarse cornmeal)
 
  BRING THE WATER TO A BOIL, add the salt, then whisk in the polenta,
  pouring it in a slow, steady stream so that lumps don't form. Lower
  the heat, and cook about 30 minutes, while stirring. Or cook the
  polenta in a double boiler over simmering water for 45 minutes,
  giving it a stir every 15 minutes or so. If you wish to serve the
  polenta soft, keep it over the heat in a double boiler until needed.
  To make firm polenta, pour it into a pan and set it aside; after a
  while it will cool and firm up. Turn it out of its pan and cut it
  into 1/2-inch slices. To broil or grill the polenta, brush both sides
  of each slice with olive oil and cook until lightly browned. The
  slices can also be fried in butter or olive oil, either until lightly
  colored or until crisp, and they can be used as layers in a casserole.

  any air pockets.  Smooth out the surface and allow it to cool to room
  temperature. Refrigerate the mold until it is cold. Then unmold the
  polenta onto a tray, garnish it, and serve it in slices.
  
  NOTE: If you are using cornmeal instead of corn grits, it is best to
  soak the cornmeal separately, in 2 cups of cold water; add the
  remaining 2 cups of water to the vegetables and then combine the two
  mixtures.
  
  VARIATION: Millet Polenta Use 2 cups of millet and 5 cups of water in
  place of the corn grits and the 4 cups of water.

      Title: POLENTA (PRODIGY)
 Categories: Side dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 c  Water
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Polenta (coarse cornmeal)
 
  BRING THE WATER TO A BOIL, add the salt, then whisk in the polenta,
  pouring it in a slow, steady stream so that lumps don't form. Lower
  the heat, and cook about 30 minutes, while stirring. Or cook the
  polenta in a double boiler over simmering water for 45 minutes,
  giving it a stir every 15 minutes or so. If you wish to serve the
  polenta soft, keep it over the heat in a double boiler until needed.
  To make firm polenta, pour it into a pan and set it aside; after a
  while it will cool and firm up. Turn it out of its pan and cut it
  into 1/2-inch slices. To broil or grill the polenta, brush both sides
  of each slice with olive oil and cook until lightly browned. The
  slices can also be fried in butter or olive oil, either until lightly
  colored or until crisp, and they can be used as layers in a casserole.

  characteristic brown stripes on both sides.  To broil, set thepolenta
  on a broiler pan about 4" from the heat & broil, turning once, until
  the slices are golden & slightly crisp at the edges. Remove & set on
  a platter. While the polenta is broiling, discard any bruised outside
  leaves of the radicchio, cut it in half lengthwise & then cut into
  quarters. Wash & dry each piece carefully. Drizzle half the olive oil
  over the radicchio & season with salt & pepper. Set on an oiled
  broiler or on the barbecue. As the radicchio begins to soften &
  darken in colour, turn it to broil evenly. Using your fingers or a
  knife, tear or cut the grilled radicchio into small pieces. Arrange
  over the polenta & drizzle with the rest of the olive oil & vinegar
  if you desire.  Taste for salt.  Add freshly ground pepper & serve

  until softened. Remove from liquid carefully and rinse well under
  cold running water to remove any sand still clinging. Chop mushrooms
  roughly and drain thoroughly. Strain soaking liquid at least twice
  through sieve lined with cheesecloth or paper towels, and reserve for
  use in another dish.
  
  Heat olive oil in heavy skillet and saute onion until translucent and
  tender, 10-15 minutes. Add garlic and all mushrooms, turn heat to low
  and cook, stirring intermittently, for up to 20 minutes, until
  tender. Add tomatoes, parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Continue
  cooking another 5 minutes.
  
  Cut Quick Polenta into slices 2" wide and 3-4" long and brush lightly
  with olive oil to taste. Broil until firm and lightly crisp on both
  sides. Place spoonful of hot mushroom sauce on top of each crostino

        x  Polenta
        x  Vegetables of choice
        x  Ff mozarella (opt)
 
  Have one of those boxes of polenta at home (the tube stuff doesn't
  really work for this.  If you want to make it more from scratch, feel
  free!). Make it. While it sits on the stove top, chop up veggies.
  Red, green, and yellow peppers are 'fun' (wheeeeee), while mushrooms
  and onions tend to be 'on hand'.  When the polenta is ready, pour
  into a pyrex pan (round, square, heck even non-Pyrex is fine so long
  as it is flat). Cover with spagetti sauce and veggies.  Bake. Eat. My
  less ff female friend (less ffff???) puts low fat skim mozarella on
  it, I don't. Enjoy!

  keep stirring until the mush pulls away from the sides of the pan or
  you feel you are going to start screaming uncontrollably ( It helps
  to listen to something very compelling while doing this, either a
  spouse, SO, the radio, or a political demonstration). Pour
  immediately onto a flat plate, a cake tin, or a tart pan. Smooth top
  and cool for 30 minutes until firm.
  
  Meanwhile, saute onions and garlic until lightly brown in olive oil.
  Add chopped vegetables and seasonings, cook until soft. Pile, with
  juices from veggies, onto polenta. Spread around. Add any seasonings
  you want and enough cheese to cover if you want (which is why I
  didn't put in amounts). Broil or nuke until melted and toasted sort

  pulls away from the side, it should take about 30 minutes.  Remove
  from heat & stir in the margarine.
  
  To serve, top with marinara sauce or caponata.  Spread onto an oiled
  baking sheet, cover & refrigerate for later use as a pizza crust or
  for sandwiches.

      Title: POLENTA WITH LEEKS & GORGONZOLA
 Categories: Corn, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lg Fennel bulbs
      3 lg Onions, yellow
      5 tb Olive oil, fruity green
           Salt & pepper to taste
    2/3 c  Dry red wine
      2 lg Leeks; white only
      1 ts Butter
      6 c  Vegetable broth; or more
      1 c  Yellow cornmeal
      3 oz Gorgonzola blue cheese
           Flat-leaf parsley; chopped
 
  Trim the fennel bulbs, wash them well, cut them in half lengthwise,
  and then slice them about 1/4-inch thick. Peel the onions and slice
  them the same way.
  
  Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large non-stick pan and cook
  the fennel and onions in it slowly, stirring often, adding a little
  salt and pepper to taste, until they are completey soft and golden
  brown. Stir in the wine, and continue cooking until it almost all
  simmers away, then set the pan aside.
  
  Clean the leeks thoroughly, cut them in half lengthwise, then slice
  them quite thinly crosswise. Heat the remaining olive oil and the
  butter in a non-stick pan and saute the leeks in it, stirring them
  often, until they are soft and beginning to color. Add a little
  sprinkle of salt -- but not too much.
  
  Heat 6 cups of broth in a medium-sized saucepan and whisk in the
  polenta. Lower the heat and simmer the polenta, stirring with a
  wooden spoon constantly, or at least very often, until it is thick
  and smooth, about 30 minutes. Stir in the sauteed leeks; break the
  Gorgonzola into chunks and stir it in. Keep stirring until the cheese
  is all melted into the cornmeal. The polenta should be thick and
  smooth, but not stiff. If it is holding a shape as you stir it,
  gradually mix in a bit more vegetable broth.
  
  Meanwhile, warm up the carmelized fennel and onion mixture. This too
  could be moistened with a bit of vegetable broth if needed.
  
  Ladle the polenta into warm, shallow bowls or onto warm plates, and
  spoon some of the fennel and onion mixture around the polenta.
  Scatter some fresh flat-leaf parsley across the top and serve at once
  with a good red wine.

           Basic polenta (see below)
           Cooking spray
      1 c  (4 oz) shredded no-fat swiss
           Cheese (totally optional)
 
  Heat a large Dutch oven, non-stick or sprayed with Pam. Add onions
  and push around to brown a little. Add a few Tbsp water and stir to
  unstick from bottom. Add Chopped Kale or spinach and stir about 5
  minutes until all is wilted and onions are translucent. Add more
  water as needed to prevent burning.
  
  Add jalapeno,  cumin, cinnamon and garlic, saute 3 minutes. Stir in
  mushrooms, cover and cook 5 minutes, Stir in tomatoes, cover and cook
  5 minutes, Add salt, pepper and mashed pumpkin and stir well. Cook
  uncovered 3 minutes, stirring well. Remove from heat.
  
  Prepare basic Polenta, spread half in 11x7x2 inch baking dish coated
  with non-stick spray.  Spread pumpkin mixture evenly over polenta.
  Sprinkle with Swiss cheese (optional)   Spread remaining polenta
  evenly over. Bake at 375 F for 30 minutes or until lightly browned..
  Let stand 5 minutes before serving. Yeild 6 servings.
  
  Basic Polenta:
  
    1 1/4    cups cornmeal
      1/2    teaspoon salt
        4    cups water
  
  1. Place cornmeal and salt in large saucepan. Gradually add water,
  stirring constantly with a wire wisk. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to
  medium, cook uncovered 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Yeild 4 cups.
  
  2.  Microwave method: Place cornmeal and salt in a 3 quart microwave
  cassarole.  Gradually add water, stirring until blended. Cover,
  microwave on HIGH 12 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes. Let stand
  covered 5 minutes.
  
  I made this two times, the first time I couldn't find kale in the
  particular grocery store that I went to so I used spinach. I used the
  microwave method for polenta since I tend to scorch things and it
  worked great.  The first 2 times I stirred I wasn't sure it was going
  to thicken by the time it finished it was perfect and it sure is easy
  to just set the timer for 3 minutes and stir when it beeps. The
  non-fat cheese is totally optional, in fact I shredded it then forgot
  to put it in the first time . In is fine without cheese, but the
  cheese tasted good on the microwaved leftovers too.  (The only edible
  non-fat cheese I've found is called Lifetime brand and they don't
  sell it in every store here). The effect is rather like lasagna but
  different.

  To roast the vegetables for the ragu, preheat an oven to 450F (230C).
  Put the butternut squash in a baking pan and place in the center of
  the oven. Bake, uncovered, until soft butnot mushy when pierced, about
        1    hour.
  
  About 40 minutes before that squash is ready, place all the other
  vegetables in a large baking pan keeping each vegetable separate, and
  cover with aluminum foil. Place the second baking pan in the oven and
  bake for 15-20 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until tender
  when pierced with a fork, 20-25 minutes longer. Remove all the
  vegetables from the oven and let cool.
  
  Peel the butternut squash. Cut the squash; turnip, parsnip or
  rutabaga; zucchini; eggplant; bell pepper; and tomatoes into 1 inch
  dice. Thinly slice the leek crosswise, and quarter the mushrooms.
  Keep the vegetables separate.
  
  To make the ragu, in a saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil.
  Add the turnip, parsnip or rutabaga and leek and saute for 1 minute.
  Raise the heat to high and add the zucchini, eggplant, bell pepper
  and mushrooms and saute for 2 minutes. Add the squash and saute for 1
  minute. Add the tomatoes and saute for 1 minute longer.
  
  Add the broth and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and
  simmer until the flavors are blended, 2-3 minutes. Add the wine and
  simmer for 1 minute longer. Season to taste with salt and black
  pepper. Keep warm.
  
  To make the polenta, in a deep saucepan over high heat, bring that
  water and butter to a boil. Slowly pour in the polenta while stirring
  continuously with a whisk. Allow the mixture to bubble, whisking
  constantly, Cook 1-2 minutes as it thickens. Reduce the heat to low
  and continue to simmer, whisking constantly to prevent burning and
  lumps from forming, until the polenta grains swell and are tender
  like porridge, about 5 minutes for quick-cooking polenta and 20
  minutes for regular polenta or according to package directions.
  Duringthe last few minutes of cooking, stir in the herbs and cheese
  and season to taste with salt and white pepper.
  
  To serve:  Ladle the polenta onto warmed individual plates. Make a
  well in the center of each serving, ladle the ragu over the top.
  Serves 4 to 6.

           Garnish
 
  Gradually add the polenta to the 4 C water or stock, stirring as it is
  added to prevent lumps from forming. Cook over low heat, stirring
  frequently, about every 5 min for about 30 - 40 min. The polenta burns
  easily. It hhas finished cooking when the mixture is hard to stir and
  the stirring spoon is able to stand within the polents. Before it
  becomes too thick, you may want to add salt to taste. Add sm. amounts
  of liquid if the cornmeal is not cooked and toom much liquid has
  evaporated. Once cooked, transfer the polenta to a baking dish or
  cookie sheet and smooth out until it is a uniform height. Allow to
  cool somewhat. While this is cooling prepare the tomato sauce.
  
  To start the sauce, puree the tomatoes with their canned liquid. Set
  aside. Braise the onions in red wine with the garlic, basil and
  oregano. When tie wine has been reduced and the onions are tender,
  add the pureed tomatoes. Cook for approx. an hour, stirring
  frequently, until the sauce is thick and with little visible liquid.
  Season with salt and pepper to taste. There should be about 1 1/2 C
  sauce.
  
  Serve the polenta with tomato sauce ladled over the top. Garnish with
  basil or Italian parsley.
  
  This is EXCELLENT!

      Title: POLENTA WITH TOMATOES & OLIVES
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Polenta
      3 oz Stoned olives (optional)

MMMMM--------------------FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE-------------------------
  1 1/4 lb (generous) canned tomatoes
      1 lg Onion
      1 tb Olive oil
           Garlic, bay, rosemary, thyme
           -- (or herbs of your choice)
 
  Bring 1-3/4 pints salted water to the boil.  Reduce the heat to low
  and add the grain as though you were making porridge: let the polenta
  trickle slowly through your fingers and stir the contents of the pan
  very vigorously all the time to prevent lumps forming. Cook over the
  gentlest possible heat for about 20 minutes, stirring more or less
  continuously - like porridge and semolina, polenta is a great sticker.
   The mixture is ready when it begins to come away from the sides of
  the pan, is perfectly smooth and so thick that your wrist aches from
  stirring. Away from the heat beat in 1 tablespoon oil, the stoned
  olives if using them, and some salt and pepper.  Use the remaining 1
  tablespoon oil to grease the interior of an 11-12 inch frying pan.
  Turn the polenta into the frying pan, pack it down smoothly and level
  the top with an oiled spoon. Set aside for a couple of hours until
  the polenta is cold and solid. Loosen it with a palette knife, turn
  it out of the pan and cut into 6-8 wedges.
  
  To make the sauce, chop the onion finely and sweat it in the oil for
  10-12 minutes.  Add the roughly chopped tomatoes and their juices,
  several cloves of finely chopped garlic and a little bouquet of
  rosemary, bay and thyme, or plenty of well-flavoured herbs of your
  choice. Let the mixture bubble away gently for 40 minutes or so, just
  stirring occasionally, until reduced to a rich and fragrant sauce.
  Remove the bouquet of herbs, season with salt and pepper and add
  extra fresh chopped herbs to taste.
  
  Fry the wedges of polenta in very hot olive oil or unsalted butter,
  or a mixture of the two, for 4-5 minutes on each side until lightly
  crusted and heated right through. Serve piping hot with the garlicky
  tomato sauce, and with a bowl of olives or grated Parmesan if you
  wish. In the Veneto polenta sometimes accompanies small silvery fried
  fish, or a dish of Fergato alla Veneziana.  Quail or other tiny game
  birds threaded on to skewers and cooked on a spit, or a saute of
  chicken livers, and grilled sausages, are other good choices but
  polenta can be served on its own just as well.

  polenta into a lightly oiled shallow baking dish, smooth top and let
  cool for 1 hour, or up to 24 hours. When you are ready to bake the
  o=polents, remove from refrigerator, run a knife around the inside of
  the pan and turn on a flat surface. Cut into squares and place on a
  lightly oiled baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 15
  minutes or until the tops begins to brown lightly. For the sauce:
  Bring a cup of vegetable stock to a simmer in a saucepan. Add the
  onions and cook, covered, until they are transparent, about 15
  minutes. Add zucchini, asparagus, and mushrooms and simmer uncovered
  for 15 minutes. Add the tomatoes, parsley, garlic and salt and pepper
  to taste. Cook another 5 minutes, Sppon mixture over bowl of soft
  polenta or 2 squares of baked polenta. Garnish with goat cheese and
  serve at once.

      Yield: 72 Servings
 
      1 c  Unsalted Butter -- At Room
           Temperature
    1/2 c  (Scant)
      2 lg Hard-Cooked Egg Yolks --
           Pressed Thru' Sieve

      1 ts Vanilla Extract
      2 c  All-Purpose Flour --
           Unbleached
           Sugar
 
  1. Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar in a
  mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the cooked and raw egg
  yolks and both extracts. Using a wooden spoon, gradually incorporate
  the flour to make a smooth, somewhat stiff dough. Wrap dough in
  plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours. 2. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
  3. Roll out the dough 2/3 inch thick on a lightly floured surface.
  (The cookies are supposed to be plump.) Cut into shapes with small 1
  to 1 1/2-inch cookie cutters - hearts and stars work nicely. Gather
  up the scraps, reroll, and cut out more cookies. Place 1/2 inch apart
  on ungreased baking sheets. 4. Bake cookies until they just begin to
  take on the slightest tinge of color, about 10 mins. Cool on wire
  racks and store in an airtight container up to 1 week. Makes about 6
  dozen small cookies.

  1. Start sourdough starter at least 3 days before baking: Combine the
  cold water, rye flour, and yeast in a bowl. Mix well; it will be
  lumpy. Pour the mixture in a clean bowl, cover with a cloth, and
  refrigerate for 3 days. 2. Remove the starter from the refrigerator 2
  hours before beginning to make the bread. 3. Transfer the starter to
  a large bowl and add the warm water, yeast, flours, salt, cornmeal
  and caraway seeds and mix until smooth, 5 minutes. 4. Divide the
  dough in half. Shape into 2 even rounds. Place each round in a
  lightly greased bowl, cover with a clean cloth, and set aside to rise
  in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hrs. 5. Place a
  roasting pan on the bottom of the oven and fill with hot water.
  Preheat the oven to 400F. Sprinkle a baking sheet with corn- meal. 6.
  Dampen your hands and reshape the bread into even round mounds. Place
  the loaves on a prepared baking sheet. Bake the bread until crusty,
  about 2 hours. If the water in the roasting pan runs low during the
  baking, replenish it to provide the bread with steam heat. Cool, or
  serve warm. Makes 2 large loaves.

      3 lb Lean pork butt, cubed
      1 lb Lean beef chuck, cubed
    1/2 lb Veal, cubed
    1/2 lb Pork fat, cubed
  2 1/2 ts Salt, or to taste

  "Recipes for this sausage are so variable that what passes for
  kielbasa in one area might be regarded as not authentic in another.
  The ingredients and pronunciation of kielbasa are as variable as are
  the vagaries of the spring weather, the time of year when kielbasa is
  traditionally made. This version uses pork, beef, and veal and makes
  five lb"
  
  1. Prepare the casings. 2. Grind the meats and fat together through
  the coarse disk. 3. Mix the remaining ingredients with the meat. 4.
  Stuff the casings and leave the sausage in long links. Lengths of
  eighteen inches to two feet are traditional. 5. Allow the sausage to
  dry in a cool place for three or four hours or refrigerate for
  twenty-four hours uncovered. 6. Cook by roasting in a 425~ F. oven
  for forty-five minutes. These sausages are also excellent grilled
  over a charcoal fire and eaten in a Kaiser roll, lathered with a
  spicy brown mustard.

      Title: POLISH NOODLES
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Sweet butter
      8 oz Sour cream*
      1 lb Ham, cubed
     16 oz Ripened tomatoes, chopped
      2 c  Elbow macaroni**
      1 oz Maggi Seasoning OR
           -1 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Salt, optional
    1/2 ts Pepper
      2    Green onions, chopped
 
  *light if desired (don't use non-fat) **cooked al Dente (be careful
  not to overcook)
  
  Brown butter in Dutch oven. Add remaining ingredients except onions,
  salt (if using) and pepper. Mix well. Simmer uncovered for 10
  minutes. Add onions and cook 5 minutes more.
  
  Melinda's notes: I got this from an old Polish acquaintance long ago.
  I don't know how original Polish it is since it uses Maggi Seasoning,
  which I think is German, but we like it. Maggi Seasoning comes in a
  square-ish brown bottle and can be purchased in the gourmet section
  of your supermarket. I always omit the salt. The original recipe
  called for 4 oz. sour cream, but I like it with 8 oz. I usually use
  the light sour cream, but the non-fat doesn't do well, it seems to
  just dissolve and become tasteless.

 Categories: Meats, Polish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Pork butt or shoulder
      2 ts Salt
           Black pepper to taste
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
    1/4 ts Dried basil
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/4 ts Mustard seeds
    1/2 ts Dried marjoram
    1/3 c  Plus 1 tsp ice-cold water
 
  Cut pork into 1 1/2 " cubes, trimming all gristle and bone. Pass
  through a meat grinder with a coarse blade. Adjust the fat-to-lean
  ratio to be about 1:3 if you can. Put pork in a large stainless or
  ceramic crock or bowl. Mix the dry spices in a small bowl. Using your
  hands, toss the meat while adding the spices a small amount at a
  time. When half the spices are in, add half the ice water. Mix
  keeping the meat as loose as possible. Add remaining spices & water
  as above. At this point you may fry a small patty of the meat to test
  for seasonings. Adjust if necessary. Refrigerate the sausage mix
  overnight. You may check for seasonings again the next day (but be
  careful! You'll be tempted to fry it all right then and eat it up!)
  Stuff the mix into about 5' of rinsed casings, tying off about 8"
  lengths. You may grill, steam or fry the sausages as you prefer.

   In a medium bowl, combine the milk, egg, butter, and orange peel and
  set aside. Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a
  large bowl. Add the halved cranberries, cheese and nuts. Toss with a
  fork to distribute.  Add the milk mixture all at once and stir the
  flour mixture until just moistened.  Turn into the prepared loaf pan
  and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven or until a
  wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool in the pan
  on a rack for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan. Cool to room
  temperature on the wire rack before slicing.

      3 oz Semisweet chocolate;
           Coarsely chopped - OR -
      3 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
    1/2 c  Red-cal. margarine (tub)
      4    Lg eggs (room temperature)
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour

           Unsweetened cocoa powder
           To garnish (optional)
 
  Preheat oven to 350. Lightly spray an 8" square baking pan with
  nonstick cooking spray. In top of double boiler, over barely
  simmering water (or in microwave), melt chocolate and margarine;
  remove from heat and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool to room
  temperature. In large bowl, with electric mixer at high speed, beat
  eggs and sugar until pale yellow, thick and tripled in volume, about
  7 minutes. Beat in vanilla and salt. By hand, stir in cooled
  chocolate mixture, then fold in flour, just until incorporated. Pour
  evenly into prepared pan and bake 20-25 minutes, just until a knife
  inserted in center comes out almost clean. (If brownies are slightly
  underbaked, they will have a fudgier texture.) Cool on rack before
  cutting into 8 equal bars. If desired, dust brownies with either
  confectioners' sugar or cocoa. Makes 8 servings of 1 brownie each.
   Each serving provides: 1/2 protein exchange, 1/2 bread exchange, 1
  1/2 fat exchange, 115 calories optional exchange. Per serving: 236

      1    Chicken, cut into serving
           -pieces
           Salt and pepper to taste
           Shortening
      1 c  White sauce, made according
           -to your favorite recipe
      2    Egg yolks, well beaten
      1    8-ounce package noodles
    1/4 c  Grated mild cheese
      1 ts Meat extract
    1/2 pt Sweet cream
           Watercress
 
  Just from the ingredients I would never have guessed this to be a
  Mexican recipe.
  
  We thank Angela de Leon Perez for this delightful chicken in cream
  sauce. Disjoint the chicken, season with salt and pepper, and saute
  in shortening until golden brown and almost done. Turn once or twice
  to brown evenly. When almost done, remove chicken from bones and cut
  into chunks.
  
  Prepare a rich white sauce according to your favorite recipe and add
  to it 2 well-beaten egg yolks.  Cook noodles according to directions
  on package and add white sauce, salt, pepper, grated cheese, and meat
  extract, and pour into a buttered ring mold.  Heat in a 350F oven
  over a pan of hot water for about 1/2 hour or until mold is firm.
  
  Place chicken pieces in cream and heat, but do not allow the cream to
  boil. Unmold the noodles and fill with creamed chicken in the center.
  Garnish with watercress.
  
  Makes 4 or 5 servings.

      2 tb Flour
      2 tb Oil
      2 tb Butter

      1 tb Chopped tarragon (or 1 tsp

      1 tb Chopped capers

      4 oz White wine

      6 oz Heavy cream
           Salt & pepper
      1 tb Chopped parsley
 
  Servings: 4 Notes: "I name this recipe for the beautiful and
  fascinating Cleopatra. I would have liked to serve this dish to her
  as she sailed down the Nile on her barge to "caper" with Anthony."
  
  DIRECTIONS: Heat the oil and butter in a large frypan. Dredge the
  chicken in the flour and saute for 3 minutes on each side. Add the
  green onions, tarragon, capers and cook for 5 more minutes. Pour in
  the wine, stock, brandy and cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Season
  with salt and pepper. Serve over rice or pasta with chopped parsley
  on top. (My notes: after adding & cooking the green onions, etc,
  remove the chicken from the pan. Add the brandy first, and simmer
  until reduced by about half. Then add the wine and beef stock and
  reduce slightly. Add the cream and return the chicken to the pan-
  simmering 5 minutes as above.)

 Categories: Poultry, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Chicken, halved
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      3    Dried red chilies, stemmed
           - and seeded
      2    Lemons
           Freshly ground pepper
           Salt
 
  On a stove burner, heat the olive oil in a small pan over medium heat.
   Add the chili pods and saute them until they are a deep, dark brown.
  Turn off the heat and cool the olive oil and throw away the browned
  chilies. (the alternative is to add Tabasco sauce to the oil to make
  it hot without cooking it) Crack the leg and wing joints of the
  chickens loose and spread them out, skin side up on a board or clean
  counter. Pound the chickens will with a meat mallet to flatten them
  out. Add the juice of 1 of the lemons to the seasoned olive oil along
  with 3 or 4 twists of pepper. Put the chicken halves in a big bowl,
  pour the seasoned olive oil over them and turn the peices over and
  over to coat them well. Let the chicken stand for 1 - 2 hours,
  turning the halves from time to time. Start your charcoal grill. When
  your grill is heaped high with hot coals, put the marinated chicken
  halves on to cook, skin side down. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and
  a little more pepper, grill thoroughly, turning and basting with the
  remaining marinade.  The chicken is done when it is tender and has a
  dark brown crust all over (some spots may well be charred) You can
  use the broiler in your oven, but an oven broiler never seems to get
  hot enough. If you want to try, preheat the broiler, put the chicken
  as close to the flame or coil as possible and broil it, turning it
  frequently and basting it often.  Serve chicken hot with lemon
  wedges. From Time Life - The Good Cook ~ Poultry

  Recipe by: The Classic Italian Cookbook by Marcella Hazan Preheat
  oven to 375F
  
  Put all the garlic and half the rosemary into the bird's cavity. Add a
  large pinch of salt and a few grindings of pepper.
  
  Rub about half the oil over the outside of the chicken, and sprinkle
  with salt, some more pepper, and the rest of the rosemary.
  
  Put the chicken and the rest of oil in a roasting pan and place it in
  the middle level of the preheated oven. Turn the chicken and baste it
  with the fat and cooking juices every 15 minutes. Cook for about 1
  hour, or until the skin is well browned and crisp.
  
  Transfer the chicken to a warm platter.  Tip the pan and draw off all
  but 1 tbsp of fat with a spoon. Place the pan over the stove burner,
  turn on the heat to high, add 1 to 2 tbsp of water, and while it
  boils away scrape up all the cooking residue.  Pour over the chicken
  and serve.
  
  Now that you read all of that, let me tell you how I improvised.
  Basically, I used a cut up chicken and did it on top of the stove
  covered, rather than roasted . Sauteing the chicken until browned and
  then cooking covered until done.

      Title: POLLO CON MOLE VERDE
 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lb Chicken, roasting
      4 c  Chicken stock; hot
    3/4 c  Pumpkin seeds
      8    Peppercorns
    1/8 ts Cumin seeds
      2    Tomatillos
      2    Jalape#os; roast/peel/seed
      4    Scallion, w/tops
      2    Garlic clove; mashed
      2 tb Chicken fat or lard
      1 bn Mustard greens
      2 lg Romaine lettuce leaves
      4    Cilantro, fresh; sprig
 
  Put whole chicken in a casser#le, cover with the stock, and bring to a
  simmer. Cover pot and poach chicken just below the simmering point
  over very low heat or in a very low oven (275 degrees) for 1 hour.
  Remove chicken from stock and let it cool enough to carve it.
  
  Toast the pumpkin seeds together with the peppercorns and cumin in a
  hot ungreased skillet about 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent
  scorching. Put into a blender and grind fine.
  
  Remove outer husks from the tomatillos, put them in a pan with cold
  water to cover, and bring to a simmer. Simmer 10 minutes, drain, then
  add them to the blender with 1/2 cup of their liquid and blend to a
  smooth thick puree. Chop all the remaining ingredients and add them
  to the blender. Add chicken stock, if needed, to thin the puree. Pour
  sauce into the skillet and simmer about 10 minutes to evaporate some
  of the liquid.
  
  Carve chicken in 4 or more pieces and add to the sauce, coating the
  pieces well.  If possible,let chicken sit overnight in the sauce so
  that the seasoning permeates and the hotness of the chili diminishes.
  Reheat gently so that sauce does not boil. Serve hot or at room
  temperature.

    1/2 ts Dry basil
    1/2 ts Dry thyme
    1/3 c  Dry white wine
 
  Brown the chicken well in the butter and bacon drippings. Season with
  salt and pepper, and place in a deep casserole which has a cover. In
  the fat in which the chicken was browned, stir together the
  mushrooms, eggplant, tomato, green pepper, onions, garlic, basil and
  thyme for 2 to 3 minutes until the vegetables just begin to soften.
  Add to the chicken in the casserole.  Pour the wine into the skillet,
  scrape loose any brown bits from the bottom and pour with the wine
  over the chicken. Cover the casserole and bake in a moderate oven
  (350 F.) for about 45 minutes or until the chicken is tender. Don't
  even consider using a crockpot; this is enormously superior. NOTE:
  The small amount of wine is all the liquid needed.  Plenty of
       water is released from the vegetables, so there is no danger of
       the food going dry and burning.

      Title: POLLO PIBIL (CHICKEN STEAMED WITH FRUIT JUICE)
 Categories: Latin amer., Main dish, Chicken, Mexican, Time/life
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Orange juice; fresh
    1/3 c  Lemon juice; fresh
      1 tb Annatto (achiote) seeds;
           ;ground in a blender or
           ;pulverized with a mortar
           ;and pestle
      1 ts Garlic; finely chopped
    1/2 ts Dried oregano
    1/2 ts Cumin seeds; ground
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper; freshly ground
      1    Chicken (3 1/2 to 4 pounds);
           ;cut into 6 to 8 serving
           ;pieces
     12    Tortillas; hot, (hand or
           ;ready made)
 
    In a small bowl, combine the orange and lemon juice, ground annatto
  seeds, garlic, oregano, cumin, clove, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Place
  chicken in a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold the pieces
  snugly in one layer and pour the seasoned fruit juice over it. Cover
  the dish with plastic wrap and marinate the chicken for 6 hours at
  room temperature, or 12 hours or overnight in the refrigerator,
  turning the pieces over in the marinade from time to time.
    Line a large colander with 2 crossed, overlapping sheets of
  aluminum foil and arrange the chicken on it.  Pour in the marinade,
  then bring the ends of the foil up over the chicken and twist them
  together to seal in the chicken and its marinade securely.
    Place the colander in a deep pot, about 1 inch larger in diameter
  than the colander, and pour enough water into the pot to come to
  within an inch of the bottom of the colander.  Bring the water to a
  vigorous boil over high heat, cover the pot securely and reduce the
  heat to low. Steam for 1 3/4 hours, or until the chicken is tender,
  checking the pot from time to time and adding more boiling water if
  necessary.
    To serve, remove the package of chicken from the colander, open it,
  and transfer the chicken and all of its sauce to a heated bowl or
  platter. Accompany it with tortillas, served in a basket, in place of
  bread.
  
    NOTE:  In Yucatan, the chicken is wrapped in banana leaves and
  steamed in a special pit called a pib.

 Categories: Rice, Beans, Vegetarian, Oriental
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Dried red kidney beans
    1/2 lb Carrots, cut into 1/4-in
           -cubes
    1/2 ts Sugar
      5 tb Corn oil
  4 1/4 c  Water
      2 c  Raw rice, covered with
           -lightly salted water
           -for 1/2 hour
      1 md Potato, peeled and cut into
    1/4    -in thick slices
      1 tb Water
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  There are variations of variations in the artful combinations of
  Persian rice.  Here is one that, with very few ingredients, manages
  to encompass a wide range of seasonings and flavors.
  
  1.  Cover the beans with water and soak them overnight. Drain. Cover
  the beans with water again and cook, covered, over moderate heat
  until they are soft but still whole, about 1/2 hour.  Drain and set
  aside.
  
  2.  Put the carrots, sugar, 1 tablespoon of the oil, and 1/4 cup of
  the water into a pan and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, or until
  the liquid evaporates. Be careful not to burn the carrots. Set aside.
  
  3.  Bring the remaining 4 cups of water to a boil in a pan. Drain
  nearly all the water from the rice and add the rice to the boiling
  water. Cover the pan and cook over moderate heat for 10 minutes.
  Drain, run the rice under cold water, and drain again.
  
  4.  Put 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil in a pan large enough to
  spread out the potato slices flat on its bottom. Sprinkle over this
  the 1 tablespoon of water. All the other ingredients are to be added
  in layers as follows: Add 1/2 cup of the rice over the potatoes.
  Cover this with the carrots and a few sprinkling of the cinnamon.
  Cover with the beans. Continue in this manner, one layer after
  another, ending with beans. Sprinkle cinnamon lightly over each
  layer. Shape the top layer into a pyramid.
  
  5.  Cover the pan and cook over low heat for 10 minutes. Sprinkle the
  balance of the oil (2 tablespoons) over the top and cover the pan with
  paper kitchen towels and the pan cover. Continue to cook over low
  heat for 15 minutes more.  The rice, carrots, and beans will be
  cooked through and the potato and oil will develop their own crisp
  crust on the bottom.
  
  Serve warm.  Serve 4 to 6 with other dishes.

  :          sweet, mature vineripened

  :          seeded
        4 TB s extra virgin olive oil
        2 lg cloves garlic, -- bruised
        1 sm red onion, -- finely
  :          chopped
        1 md celery stalk, including
  :          leaves, -- finely chopped
  :       l  small carrot, -- scraped and
  :          finely chopped
        1 TB chopped fresh Italian
  :          parsley
  :       sm handful of chopped fresh
  :          basil
        2 TB tomato paste
  :          Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt, or
  :          to taste
  :          Freshly milled black or
  :          white pepper to taste
  
  If using canned tomatoes, drain the tomatoes in a colander, reserving
  their juice. Strain the captured tomato juice to hold back the seeds.
  Using your fingers, push out excess seeds from each tomato. Chop the
  tomatoes and set aside. If using fresh tomatoes, bring a large
  saucepan threefourths full of water to a boil. Slip in the tomatoes
  and blanch for 30 to 45 seconds. Drain the tomatoes and immediately
  plunge them into cold water. Using a paring knife, lift off the skins
  and cut out the tough area around the core of each tomato. Cut the
  tomatoes into quarters lengthwise and, using your fingers, push out
  the excess seeds. Chop the tomatoes.
  
  In a saucepan over mediumlow heat, warm 3 tablespoons of the olive
  oil, the garlic, and onion together, and saute until the garlic is
  golden and the onion is translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Then add the
  celery, carrot, parsley, and basil, and saute until the vegetables
  are soft, about 10 minutes. Press down on the vegetables with the
  back of a wooden spoon to release their flavors. Add the tomato paste
  and continue to saute for 3 minutes. Then add the tomatoes and their
  juice, cover partially, and simmer gently until thickened, about 45
  minutes. Remove and discard the garlic cloves and season to taste
  with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining
  1 tablespoon olive oil. If a smooth sauce is desired, allow it to
  cool somewhat. Position a food mill over a clean saucepan and pass
  the sauce through it, being sure to press out as much of the pulp as
  possible. Place over medium heat just long enough for the sauce to
  heat through, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the
  remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
  
  Yield: approximately 2 cups
  
  Note: This recipe is sufficient for saucing 1 pound of pasta.
  
  Ahead of time note: The sauce can be made 4 to 5 days in advance of
  using and stored tightly covered in the refrigerator, or it can be
  frozen for up to 3 months. Whether storing it in the refrigerator or
  freezer, leave out the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Stir it into
  the sauce after reheating.

      Title: POMEGRANATE JELLY
 Categories: Preserves
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Pomegranate juice
           -fresh or frozen, thawed
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
      1 pk Powdered pectin (2 oz.)
  4 1/2 c  Sugar
 
  Prepare 3 pint-sized canning jars, as per normal canning procedures.
  In a large kettle, combine the pomegranate juice, lemon juice, and
  pectin. Over high heat, bring to a rolling boil, stirring constantly.
  Add the sugar and stir to blend; bring to a second rolling boil; then
  boil exactly 2 minutes. Remove jelly from heat immediately when time
  is up. Let stand a minute to allow foam to form; then carefully
  remove the foam. Pour hot jelly quickly into hot jars, filling jars
  to within about 1/8-inch of tops. Carefully wipe off rim of jar.  Put
  lid on each jar as it is filled, screwing band on as tightly as you
  comfortably can. Cool jars away from drafts on a towel. Makes 3
  pints. OTHER NOTES: For an easy way to remove seeds, cut the crown
  end off each pomegranate and lightly score the peel lengthwise down
  the sides in several places. Put the scored fruit in a bowl or sink
  of cold water and let soak at least 5 minutes. Holding the fruit
  under water, break sections apart with your fingers and separate the
  seeds from the pulp; as you work, the seeds sink to the bottom and
  the pulp and peel float. With a wire strainer, skim off the pulp.
  POMEGRANATE JUICE: Whirl about 1-1/2 to 2 cups pomegranate seeds at a
  time in a blender until liquefied. Pour through a cheesecloth-lined
  wire strainer and let drain gradually. (Or to speed the straining,
  wear rubber gloves and press small amounts of seeds and juice at a
  time through the cheesecloth.) Store in refrigerator up to 5 days, or
  freeze for longer storage.  One medium-sized pomegranate makes about
  1/2 cup juice.

  1. Remove giblets and neck from duckling.  Remove and discard excess
  fat from inside body cavity.  Cut off and discard excess neck skin.
  Rinse duckling, giblets, and neck in cold water and pat dry with
  paper towels. Cut off and reserve first 2 joints of the wings,
  leaving only the third. To cut duckling into quarters, using poultry
  shears, cut duckling lengthwise in half through the breastbone and
  continue cutting along one side of the backbone; cut duckling halves
  in half crosswise. 2. Coat bottom of 5-quart kettle or Dutch oven
  with nonstick vegetable cooking spray. Add giblets, neck, and
  reserved wing tips to kettle and cook until well browned. Add
  duckling quarters, water, onion, carrot, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the
  bay leaf.  Cover and heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to
  low and simmer, covered, until duckling is fork-tender - about 1
  hour. (If preparing ahead, remove duckling from kettle, cool, wrap,
  and refrigerate. Strain cooking liquid, discarding fat and cooked
  particles. Refrigerate liquid, or duck stock.) 3. Just before
  roasting duckling, prepare pomegranate glaze: In 1-quart saucepan,
  heat jelly until melted. Stir in pomegranate juice and sugar and heat
  to boiling over high heat. Boil mixture 5 minutes; remove from heat
  and set aside. 4. Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Remove duckling from
  kettle and place, skin side up, on rack in roasting pan.  (If duck
  breasts have curled up after boiling, remove their breast bones so
  they will be flat.) Roast duckling 15 minutes. 5. Meanwhile, pour
  duck stock through large strainer into bowl, discarding cooked
  particles.  Remove excess fat from stock. Reserve 1 cup stock for the
  sauce and 2 cups stock for Dried-Fruit Couscous; refrigerate
  remainder for another use. 6. Brush duckling with some glaze and
  roast 5 minutes; roast duckling 10 more minutes or until well
  browned, brushing 3 more times with glaze. Prepare Dried-Fruit
  Couscous; keep warm. Set duckling quarters aside. 7. Prepare sauce:
  In cup, combine wine and cornstarch until smooth. Stir reserved 1 cup
  stock and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt into glaze remaining in
  saucepan.  Heat to boiling and stir in cornstarch mixture. Cook,
  stirring constantly, until thickened. Pour sauce into serving bowl.
  8. Spoon Dried-Fruit Couscous onto serving plate. Arrange duckling on
  couscous.  Garnish with mint, if desired. Serve duckling and couscous
  with sauce.

  A good Italian antipasti spread always demonstrates the wisdom of
  simplicity and this tomato antipasto proves the point again.
  
  Make a dressing by combining the oil drained from a tin of anchovies
  with the juice of a lemon, freshly coarse-ground pepper and half a
  tablespoon of chopped fresh oregano. Set aside to allow the flavour
  to improve.
  
  Cut 4 ripe tomatoes into lengthwise wedges and arrange on a platter
  draping an anchovy fillet over each wedge. Pour the dressing over the
  tomatoes and serve the antipasto with crispy pane de casa from a good
  Italian bakery.

      Title: POOKIE'S LIVER & ONIONS
 Categories: Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Beef liver, in one thin cut
           Salt
           Pepper
           Flour for dredging
      2 tb Cooking oil (preferably
           -peanut, corn, or sunflower)
      2 tb Butter
      2    Green onions', minced
      1    Clove garlic, minced
  1 1/2 md Onions, sliced
  1 1/2 ts Flour
  1 1/2 c  Beef broth
    3/4 ts Kitchen Bouquet (seasoning
           -sauce)
 
  Even if you hate liver and onions, you'll find this tender, soulful
  version a revelation.  If you like liver and onions, you're about to
  see star bursts. This recipe is based on a dish by brilliant chef
  Pookie Turner.
  
  1.  Season liver with salt and pepper, to taste. Dredge lightly in
  flour.
  
  2.  Heat lightly oiled heavy skillet over high heat until fragrant,
  about 1 minute.  Add liver and fry until lightly browned, about 1
  minute per side. Remove liver and reserve.
  
  3.  Clean skillet and return it to stove over medium heat until dry.
  Add butter, and heat until it is melted. Add green onions, garlic,
  and onions; fry, stirring, until onion is translucent (about 6
  minutes).
  
  4.  Sprinkle the 1 1/2 teaspoons flour over mixture and cook briefly,
  until the flour turns golden and loses its raw aroma (about 1
  minute); do not let flour brown. Stir in broth, Kitchen Bouquet, 1/2
  teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Turn heat to medium-high and
  bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, until liquid thickens slightly,
  about 6 minutes. Adjust seasoning, if necessary.
  
  5.  Return liver to pan and cook on both sides for 30 seconds each (if
  liver is thick, cook for 90 seconds per side.) Remove from heat and
  serve immediately with boiled rice.
  
  Serves 2.

 Categories: Ron's, Heirloom, Desserts, British, Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Thick slices of bread
      2    Eggs beaten
    200 ml White wine [or milk]
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
  1 1/4 tb Sugar
           Oil for frying
           Confectioners sugar to serve
           Cinnamon to serve
 
  This dish originated during the middle ages in England and spread all
  over the world with many variations. Traditionalists should use
  bread, but stale cake is a good substitute. Red wine can be used
  instead of white. Substitute milk for wine and you have a more
  recognizable dish called, incorrectly, french toast.
  
  Bread: Cut off crusts and cut into quarters. Place in a deep dish.
  Mix eggs with wine, cinnamon, and sugar in a bowl. Pour, once mixed,
  over the bread and leave to soak for 3 minutes. Heat the oil [1/4
  inch deep]. Drain the bread and slide it into the hot oil {Watch your
  hands as it 'spits'}. Fry until golden brown on both sides Drain on
  absorbent kitchen paper. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar and ground
  cinnamon. From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:) Feb 1996.

  (the name comes from the fact that the cake calls for no eggs, no
  milk, and no butter)
  
  *NOTE:  (Since the shortening is melted, I substituted Canola oil,
  thus, I think, saving a LOT of cholestrol and saturated fats!)
  
  Boil brown sugar, 1 1/4 C water, oil or shortneing, raisins and spices
  together for three minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.
  
  Add salt and baking soda, dissolved in 2 tsp water. Sift together
  flour and baking powder, add gradually, beating after each addition.
  
  Grease and flour 8" square pan.  (I used nonfat spray instead).
  
  Bake at 325 for approximately 50 minutes, until it tests done.
  
  Needs no frosting.

      Title: POOR MAN'S FRUITCAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  Water
      2 c  Raisins
      1 c  Shortening
      2 c  Sugar
      3 c  Flour
      1 tb Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Cloves
      1 c  Walnuts
 
  Bring the water, raisins, shortening and sugar to a boil, then set
  aside and let cool.  Sift together the flour, salt, baking soda and
  spices and add to the raisin mixture. Dust the walnuts with flour to
  prevent them sinking, then fold them in.
  
  Line a ten-inch angel food cake pan with parchment, and grease and
  butter the pan. Pour in the batter and bake at 325 F. for one hour.
  It is suggested that you can add half a pound pound of candied fruit
  to this for Christmas; as usual I would just add pineapple and
  cherries.
  
  My special notes say not to turn pan over but to lift it out of the
  angel food cake pan and keep the cake upright.

  Keep popcorn warm in 200~ oven while preparing coating. In 2-quart
  saucepan stir together sugar, corn syrup, water, butter and salt.
  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a
  boil. Continue cooking without stirring until temperature reaches
  270~ on a candy thermometer or until a small amount dropped into very
  cold water separates into threads which are hard but not brittle.
  Remove from heat. Add vanilla; stir just enough to mix through hot
  syrup. Slowly pour over popcorn, stirring to coat every kernel. Cool
  just enough to handle. With greased hands, shape into balls.
  
  VARIATION: Use almond, pepermint or other flavor extract instead of
  vanilla. For colorful popcorn balls, stir a few drops of food
  coloring into syrup before adding to popped popcorn. [ Jolly Time

 Categories: Snacks, Holiday, Popcorn
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 tb Unsalted butter
      4 c  Mini marshmallows

    1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
      1 tb Milk
           Gumdrops, cinnamon candies;

           -for garnish.
 
  In a large saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the
  marshmallows and cook, stirring often, until melted and syrupy, about
  5 minutes. Place the popped popcorn in a large lightly greased
  shallow pan. Pour the syrup over the popcorn, tossing to coat evenly.
  While still warm, form 6 balls about 5" in diameter from the coated
  popcorn for the bottom sections, giving the balls flat bases so the
  snowmen will stand. Form 6 balls about 3-1/2" in diameter for the
  middle sections. Then form 6 balls about 2" in diameter for the top
  sections. Stir in the confectioners' sugar and milk together until
  smooth. Use the icing to stack three popcorn balls of decreasing

 Categories: Popovers, Pies & past
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Eggs
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Milk
      2 tb Unsalted butter -- melted
      1 c  All-purpose flour

  OVERBEAT! Fill each cup about half full using all the batter.
  
  Place popovers in a cold oven, set the temperature to
      425    degrees F and bake for 20 minutes. Popovers should rise
  considerably during this time. Reduce oven to 375 F and continue
  baking 10-15 minutes longer until popovers are golden and crisp on
  the outside. Quickly pierce each popover with a thin metal skewer or
  the tip of a small knife to release the steam. Turn the oven off and
  leave in for 5-10 minutes more for further crisping. Remove and serve
  at once.
  
  Makes 6 popovers which are about 142 calories each.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
      2 tb Poppy seeds
      2 tb Sesame seeds
      1 lg Egg white
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 ts Salt
      6    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18"
 
       Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly coat 2 baking sheets with
  nonstick cooking spray or line with parchment paper. Heat a small
  heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the poppy and sesame seeds and
  cook, stirring until they are aromatic and toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.
  Turn out onto a plate to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together egg
  white, oil and salt.
       Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side toward
  you. With a pastry brush, lightly coat the lower half of the sheet
  with the egg-white mixture and sprinkle with 1 tsp. seeds. Fold the
  upper half over to cover the lower half. Brush the right half of the
  folded sheet with egg-white mixture, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds and
  fold the left half over the seeds. Brush the bottom half of the
  folded sheet with the egg-white mixture, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds
  and fold the upper half over. Finally, brush the top with the
  egg-white mixture and sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds. Cut into 10 short
  strips using a knife or serrated pastry cutter. With a wide spatula,
  transfer the strips to the baking sheet, placing them about 1/2 inch
  apart. Repeat the procedure with the remaining 5 sheets of phyllo,
  egg-white mixture and seeds. Bake the straws for 8 to 10 minutes,
  until golden and crisp. Transfer to a rack to cool.
       The straws may be stored in an airtight container at room
  temperature for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
       Makes about 5 dozen straws.

  Yield: 2 loaves GLAZE: Mix all glaze ingredients together. Pour over
  bread when it is done. NOTE: I use orange/pineapple juice instead of
  plain orange juice. I've had it made either way and like both
  versions equally. I just happen to buy the juice blend regularly and
  seldom buy plain orange juice. (Nancy) TO BAKE IN JARS: Grease 5
  wide-mouth pint canning jars. Divide dough evenly between jars. (Jars
  will be slightly over 1/2 full.) Bake at 325 degrees for 50 minutes.
  Pull jars out of oven 1 at a time. Pour glaze over hot bread.
  Immediately apply and firmly tighten a two-piece wide-mouth canning
  lid. The lid will form a vacuum seal as the jar cools. Jars of canned
  bread may be stored on the pantry shelf with other canned foods or
  may be placed in a freezer.  The bread is safe to eat as long as jars
  remain vacuum sealed and free of mold growth. (Nancy)

      Title: POPPYSEED BUNDT CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Butter (or margarine)
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
  2 1/2 c  Flour (sift
           -before measuring)
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Buttermilk
      2 oz Poppy seeds
           -(about 1/4 cup)
      1 ts Almond extract
           -(or vanilla extract)
      4    Eggs (separated)
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
 
  Soak poppyseed in the buttermilk for 15 minutes.
  
  Cream together butter and sugar.  Add yolks to creamed mixture. Add
  almond extract or vanilla.  Add dry ingredients alternately with
  buttermilk mixture, a little at a time.
  
  Beat egg whites very stiff as for angel food.  Fold egg whites into
  mixture. Pour half of this batter mixture into well-greased Bundt pan.
  Sprinkle with a mixture of about 1/4 cup brown sugar and about 1 t
  cinnamon.  Pour in remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1
  hour. Cool and invert onto serving dish, then remove Bundt pan.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A light, delicate cake -- I got this recipe from my mom. I'm not
  sure where she got it.
  
  *  When folding in egg whites, be gentle.  Lift and turn the batter
  instead of using a stirring motion. Don't worry if a little bit of
  egg white remains unmixed; the egg whites will collapse if you mix it
  too much.
  
  *  I have tried both vanilla and almond extracts with this recipe, and
  prefer the former.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate (folding the beaten egg whites into
  the batter takes some skill).
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.
  : Precision:  Measure carefully.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Chicken, cooked
           -(white or dark meat)
     13 oz Sour cream
     13 oz Cream of chicken soup
           -(1 can of condensed soup)
      1 c  Ritz cracker pieces
           -(about 1 "tube" of
           -crackers)
      2 oz Butter
      2 tb Poppy seeds
 
  Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and put it on the bottom of a
  casserole dish big enough to hold it.
  
  Combine sour cream and condensed chicken soup in a pan and pour it
  over the chicken in an even layer.
  
  In the same pan, (save dishes!) melt the butter and add broken-up
  crackers and poppy seeds. Mix together and distribute over the
  chicken and sauce.
  
  Bake at about 325 degrees F. for 20-30 minutes, until the topping is
  brown, the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is hot.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken casserole with poppy seeds -- This is an easy and good way
  to use some cooked chicken. I got the recipe from my grandmother, who
  "hates to cook" but nevertheless seems to do a great job...
  
  *  Somehow this doesn't seem very nutritious.  Serve it with lots of
  vegetables.  Broccoli and carrots go well. Use more or less of the
  ingredients to taste, or depending on how many you are serving. Use
  different soups. Add mushrooms. Add other stuff. Have fun.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  40 minutes.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      3    Egg yolks
      2 oz Almond slivers
      4 oz Raisens
      4 oz Walnuts
      1 tb Honey
 
  Dissolve the yeast and 1 T of sugar in the warm milk, add 1 T of
  flour. Let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes in a warm place
  (bubbles will indicate active yeast). Now add slowly all above
  ingredients and beat, dough should be soft, if necessary add more
  warm milk.
  
  Lift the dough from the bowl and knead on a floured board until
  blisters appear on the dough's surface. Shape the dough into a ball,
  return it to the bowl, cover with wax paper. Let rise for one hour in
  a warm place (100').
  
  Now divide the dough in two balls, roll it out to about 1 finger
  thickness, spread the poppyseed filling and roll together. You will
  have 2 strudels. Preheat the over to 325'. Bake 1 hour.
  
  Di Note:  I worked with Raisa when I was with CBS. She had come over
  from Russia and she and I would chat on the phone (she lived in New
  York). One day, I described this strudel thing and asked her if she
  knew what it was and she sent me her recipe.  Very good.

      Title: PORK & SCALLOPS WITH CRISP GINGER
 Categories: Pork, Meats, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS
      1 lb Asparagus
      1 lg Red pepper
      2    2-3" pieces ginger
      1    Pork tenderloin; (about 3/4
           -lb)
      2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
      2 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 c  Canola oil
    1/2 lb Brown mushrooms
    1/4 ts Salt; optional
    3/4 lb Bay scallops
 
  To remove tough ends from tender asparagus spears--the easy way, hold
  base of stalk firmly and bend.  End will snap and break off at just
  the right spot for the best eating.
  
  About 1 hour before serving, discard tough ends from asparagus, trim
  scales, cut diagonally into 3-inch pieces. Cut pepper into strips.
  Peel ginger; grate 1 teaspoon. Cut remaining ginger lengthwise into
  very thin slices; cut slices into hair-thin strips.  Cut pork
  tenderloin into 1/8-inch-thick slices.  In bowl, mix pork, soy sauce,
  sherry, cornstarch, sugar, and grated ginger.
  
  In 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, in hot oil, cook ginger
  strips about 1 minute or so until it has a light browned color.
  Remove ginger with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. In oil
  remaining in skillet, cook asparagus, red pepper, mushrooms, and salt
  (optional) until vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring quickly and
  frequently. With slotted spoon, remove vegetables to plate.
  
  In oil remaining in skillet over high heat, cook pork mixture over
  high heat a minute or so.  Add scallops and cook until pork loses its
  pink color and scallops are tender about 2 to 3 minutes, adding a
  little more oil if it is needed.  Return vegetables to skillet;
  stir-fry until heated through. Spoon pork mixture onto platter;
  sprinkle with ginger strips. Makes 6 servings.
  
  Note: Meat slices more easily if it is frozen slightly (about 40
  minutes). You can hold your knife on a slant and slice across the
  width to get nicely uniform pieces.

  These are the best ribs in the world. I know. I've tried them all.
  There is a BBQ joint in heaven and it has one thing on the menu. This
  is it.
  
  1 rack of pork baby back ribs per moderately hungry person. Marinate
  in cider vinegar about 10 minutes. Liberally use garlic salt and
  canned black pepper Use hickory, oak, or mesquite At 200-225, they
  should take
    2 1/2    hours
  
  Use a water pan. Sauce goes on the side. (You won't need it.)
  
  That's it? Yep. Don't mess with perfection. Don't try fresh cracked
  pepper or cloves of garlic. Don't try spare ribs. I did once and made
  my wife cry.

      Title: PORK BRAISED WITH CELERY AVGOLEMONO
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      3 lb Lean shoulder or leg of pork
      4 tb Butter or margarine
      1    Onion; finely chopped
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      3 c  Hot water (approximately)
      1    Bunch celery
      2 tb Flour
      2    Egg yolks
  1 1/2    Lemons (juice only)
           Parsley or celery leaves
 
  Wipe the pork with damp paper towels, then cut into 1-1/2 inch cubes
  (the fat and skin may be left on during the cooking and removed
  later). Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy pan or Dutch
  oven. Add the onion and cook until soft and transparent, then add the
  pork and cook, stirring, over medium heat until the raw meat color
  disappears. Season with salt and pepper, add hot water to cover, then
  cover and simmer gently (or bake in a 325 F oven) for 30 to 35
  minutes, or until almost tender. (The timing is important because the
  celery is to be added and cooked with the pork only until both are
  tender but not overcooked.)
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the celery.  Wash the stalks and scrape the heavy
  ones slightly.  Cut each stalk once lengthwise (if large) and then
  across into 1-1/2 inch slices. (Use the leaves as well, if desired,
  but a few might be saved for a garnish or an accompanying salad.) Add
  the celery to pork and continue simmering 25 minutes until both are
  tender. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pork and celery and place
  in a serving dish, first removing and discarding the fat from the
  meat. Keep warm. Skim the fat from the cooking liquid, then add water
  or boil down rapidly to make to make 1-1/2 cups. Keep hot while you
  prepare the avgolemono.
  
  To prepare the avgolemono, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in
  a pan.  Stir in the flour, and after cooking over low heat for 1
  minute, gradually add 2 cups of the hot cooking liquid from the meat.
  Stir until the sauce comes to a boil.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl,
  beat the two remaining egg yolks and add the lemon juice, droplet by
  droplet, beating all the while. Beat a little of the thickened
  cooking liquid into the yolk mixture, then add the yolks to the pan
  of hot liquid. Mix well and cook over low heat until thickened. Pour
  the hot sauce over the pork and celery, garnish with parsley or
  celery leaves and serve warm.
  
  Note: Celeriac may be substituted for the celery.  Use 2-1/2 pounds of
  celeriac, and peel, quarter, and cut it into 1/2 inch slices before
  adding it to the pork. A little scraped, diced carrot may be added
  with the celery.

  Flour, season & brown pork chops in skillet, set aside. Peel and slice
  enough potatoes to line roasting pan, filling to desired depth. Slice
  an onion over the raw potatoes and salt to taste. Place browned pork
  chops on top of potatoes. Pour two cans of cream of mushroom soup and
  a can of water over the chops. Bake (maybe 350F) uncovered about 1
  hour or until potatoes are done. Length of time depends on the amount
  of food as explained below... You can use as few pork chops &
  potatoes as you want, or as many as you can cram into the pan. I
  generally buy a pork loin or whatever is on sale at my favorite
  supermarket. I've even substituted pork steak for pork chops & that
  works too. I found that adding a little more wateer makes more gravy
  over potatoes.

      Title: PORK CHOPS ITALIANO
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Pork loin chops
 10 1/2 oz Tomato soup, condensed
           -(1 small can)
      1    Green pepper, sliced
      1    Onion, diced
      1    Bay leaf
           Oil for frying
           Salt and pepper
 
  Heat the oil in a saucepan or frying pan (choose one with a lid).
  Season both sides of the chops with salt and pepper to taste. Brown
  the chops quickly on both sides. Remove from the pan.
  
  Fry the onions until soft, but not brown.  You may need to add a
  little more fat, but I prefer to use as little as possible. Return
  the chops to the pan, add the tomato soup, green pepper and bay leaf.
  Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 30-40 minutes, or until the
  chops are cooked.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pork chops simmered in tomato and onion -- Apologies to anyone of
  Italian descent, I'm sure this dish will seem a slander on your
  culinary heritage, but that's the way I learned this recipe.
  
  As much as I like grilled pork chops, I enjoy a change. This recipe
  isn't haute cuisine, but I think it is particularly good when you get
  home from work on a cold, wet evening. The preparation is fairly
  quick, and it leaves you time to warm up in front of the fire with a
  cup of tea and read a newspaper.
  
  *  I serve this with rice.  If you like brown rice, it has the
  advantage of taking as long to cook as the rest of the meal, so you
  get an uninterrupted half-hour.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      3    Or 4 pork chops about half
           -an inch thick
     17 oz Can of creamed corn
      3    Or more green onions
      2    Eggs, beaten
      1 c  Bread crumbs
           Salt
           Pepper, freshly ground
           Sweet paprika
 
  Mince two of the green onions and mix into the creamed corn. Add the
  eggs and bread crumbs and mix well. Add enough of the bread crumbs so
  the mixture is on the stiff side. Salt the mix- ture to taste and add
  the pepper--about three grinds from a big pepper mill or 1/4 to 1/2
  teaspoon of already ground pepper and mix again.
  
  Trim  fat off chops, if desired, and brown chops in skillet. The
  skillet should be very hot and the chops seared on each side, but not
  cooked through. Remove from heat and cover the chops with the corn
  mixture. Pat it around and over the chops so that they are completely
  covered. Sprinkle paprika and scatter the remain- ing minced green
  onion evenly evenly over the top of the corn.
  
  Put the whole shebang--skillet and all--into a pre-heated 325 degree
  F. oven. Bake it for a half hour to 45 minutes. It should come out
  with a nicely browned top and moist but done chops. Serve with a
  veggie or salad on the side and, most of all, enjoy!

      1 c  Rye bread with caraway
           Seeds, cut into 1/4-in. dice
    1/4 c  Butter
  1 1/2 c  Onion, chopped fine
    1/2 ts Garlic, minced
    1/4 lb Mushrooms, diced
    1/2 c  Parsley, minced
      1 ts Caraway seeds
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
      4    Loin pork chops
           Each abut 1-in. thick
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      2 tb Red wine vinegar
    3/4 c  Chicken broth
 
  1. Preheat the oven to 300. Put the bread cubes in a baking dish and
  place in the oven. Bake about 5 min. or until lightly brown. 2.
  Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan and add 1 cup of the chopped
  onion, the garlic and the mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until wilted.
  Spoon the mixture into a mixing bowl and add the parsley, caraway
  seeds, bread cubes and egg. Stir well. 3. Holding a knife parallel to
  the surface of the meat, split each chop in half to the bone, top to
  bottom, but do not cut entirely through. Place the flaps of each chop
  on a flat surface and pound with a mallet. Do not break the flesh or
  the stuffing will ooze out. Stuff each chop with equal portions of
  stuffing. Fold the flaps together to enclose the stuffing and secure
  with wooden toothpicks. 4. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large
  enough to hold the chops in one layer without crowding. Add the chops
  and cook over moderately high heat about 4 min on each side until
  well browned. Continue cooking, turning occasionally, about 15 min.
  Transfer the chops to a hot serving dish and keep warm. 5. Pour off
  the fat from the skillet and add the remaining onion. Cook, stirring,
  about 1 min. then add the vinegar and stir well. Add the broth and
  bring to a boil, stirring. 6. Remove the toothpicks from the chops.
  Srain the sauce, pushing through the sieve as much of the solids as
  possible, and serve.

  NOTES: Russians are extremely fond of pork, which they prepare in
  interesting
       variations. On of their great hoiday treats is roast suckling pig
       stuffed with kasha. Other typical pork dishes, such as this one,
  are
       served with fruit sauces. Plums may be substi- tuted for the
  cherries,
       if desired.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Large center-cut Pork Chops
           Salt
           Freshly Ground White Pepper
  5 1/2 tb Butter
      2 ts Chopped Fresh Tarragon
      4 c  Chopped Onions

    2/3 c  Chicken Stock
    2/3 c  Fresh homemade Bread Crumbs
    2/3 c  Freshly Grated Parmesan
 
  * You can use 1 teaspoon of dried tarragon instead of 2 teaspoons of
  fresh tarragon. The pork chops should have the bone in and weigh
  about 10 oz each. ** Your doctor will have a sh*t-fit if he/she knows
  about the butter. Sprinkle chops with salt and pepper. Melt 2 1/2
  tablespoons of butter in a large heavy frying pan over medium-high
  heat and brown chops on both sides, turning frequently so they do not
  stick. Remove from pan, sprinkle with tarragon, cover and keep warm.
  Add another tablespoon of butter to the pan drippings and saute
  onions for 3 minutes or until soft and golden. Spread 2/3 of the
  onions in the bottom of a shallow casserole, arrange chops,
  tarragon-side down on top. Sprinkle lightly with thyme and cover with
  onions. Pour wine into pan, bring to a boil, add chicken stock,
  return to the boil and cook until liquid is reduced to about 2/3 of a
  cup. Pour mixture over chops. Combine bread crumbs and cheese, spread
  over onions and chops. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter and
  drizzle it over the crumbs. Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.

           Cut into 8 slices
      1 ts Sweet paprika
      2 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Onion, chopped fine
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
    1/2 c  Chicken broth
    1/2 c  Sour cream
           Parsley, chopped for garnish
 
  1. Place the meat on a flat surface and pound with a mallet to flatten
  without breaking the meat. 2. Hold a small sieve over the meat and
  add the paprika. Tap the sieve, moving it over the meat so that the
  slices are evenly coated with paprika. 3. Heat the butter in a
  skillet large enough to hold the meat in one layer. Add the meat and
  cook over high heat to brown on one side, about 3 min. Turn and brown
  on the other side, about 3-4 min. 4. Transfer the slices to a warmed
  platter and keep hot. Pour off the fat from the skillet. To the
  skillet add the onion. Cook briefly, stirring, until wilted. Add the
  wine to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom of the
  skillet. Add the chicken broth and simmer about 5 min. 5. Remove the
  sauce from the heat and stir in the sour cream. The sauce may be
  spooned over the meat now, but it is preferable to put it through a
  fine sieve and reheat it briefly before serving. 6. Sprinkle with
  parsley.

      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      2 lb Pork Butt or shoulder roast
      1    Onion, quartered
      2    Garlic cloves
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Oregano
      1 ts Cumin
      2    Bay leaves
  1 1/2 c  All purpose flour + 2tb more
    3/4 c  Masa Harina
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Lard or solid shortening
      1    Egg, beaten
    1/2 c  Milk
      1 c  Chile chipolta salsa
    1/2 ts Salt
           Milk
 
  This recipe is not as complicatated as it looks. First your prepare
  the filling which is easy to make and can be used for almost anything
  else, such as a taco filling. Next make the dough, which is no harder
  to do than pie dough.
  
  Place pork in large pot.   Cover with water.   Add onion, garlic, 1/2
  ts. salt, oregano, cumin, and bay leaves. Bring to boil, reduce heat,
  and simmer for 1
      1/2    hrs.
  
  While the pork cooks, prepare the dough.  Sift together the flour,
  Masa, baking powder and 1/4 ts. salt. In a separate bowl, beat
  together the egg and 1/2 c. milk. Make a well in the center of the
  dry ingreds..Add the egg mixture and stir with a fork until the dough
  comes together in a ball. Divide the dough into 16 even-size pieces
  and roll each piece into a ball. Place in a bowl, cover, and
  refrigerate.
  
  After pork has simmered for 1 1/2 hrs, preheat oven to 375 F.. Remove
  the pork from the liquid.  Save the stock for soup if you like. Place
  pork in a baking dish or Dutch oven. Brush with hot pepper sauce.
  Bake for 1 hr., or untill meat shreds easily with fork. Remove from
  oven and shred into small pieces. Combine Red Chile Salsa (see #141)
  and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt. On lightly floured surface, flatten a
  piece of dough with the palm of your hand. With rolling pin
  (actually, a piece of cut-off broom handle works best), roll out the
  dough to make a 5" circle, abt. 1/8" thick. Place 2-3 tbs. filling in
  center of the dough. Brush edges of dough with milk. Fold dough over
  filling. Pinch edges together. Crimp with fork to seal. Place on
  lightly greased baking sheet. Bake for 20 min.,, or until golden.
  Remove to rack and cool for abt. 5 min. Serve warm. Can be frozen
  baked or unbaked. If baking from freezer, do not thaw.  Bake in
  preheated 350 F. oven for 25-30 min. Reheat baked frozen at 350 for

  The next four posts should come in handy on the next holiday when
  you're faced with yet another turkey to fix. One is from the US, the
  rest are from other parts of the world. The Argentine Creole Stuffing
  looks *very* interesting.  All these assume you know how to stuff and
  cook a turkey.
  
  Plump sweet sultanas marry well with turkey meat, the pork mince adds
  richness and moistness and the generous quantity of fresh herbs lifts
  this stuffing out of the ordinary.
  
  Melt butter and gently fry minced pork until it changes colour,
  pressing out lumps with a fork.  Add to the rest of the ingredients
  and mix well.

      Title: PORK LOIN BRAISED IN MILK
 Categories: Meats, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Pork loin roast
           -(between 2-5 lb; you
           -can also use a pork
           -shoulder roast)
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Olive oil
           Salt
           Black pepper,
           -freshly ground
           Milk to cover roast;
           -see instructions
      2 tb Water, warm
           -(more as needed)
 
  Find a saucepan that fits the pork roast closely, but still allows
  you to turn the roast in it.  Add the butter and oil to the pan. Heat
  at medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides.
  
  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add enough milk to cover 3/4 of the
  meat. Cover the saucepan, but leave the lid ajar. Turn the heat down
  to medium and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, until the sauce has
  reduced to thick, nut-brown clusters. If the sauce has not reduced
  after 2 1/2 hours, remove the meat, keep it warm, and increase the
  heat to high until the sauce thickens.
  
  Remove the roast from the sauce, if you haven't already. Turn the
  heat down and skim the fat from the sauce. Add the water, turn the
  heat to high, and scrape the bottom of the saucepan (there will be a
  crust on the bottom that you'll want to get loose).
  
  Return the meat to the pan, warm it up, and serve it with the sauce.
  
  The cleanup for this recipe takes a while, because the saucepan gets a
  crust on the bottom.

      Title: PORK LOIN BRAISED IN MILK BOLOGNESE STYLE
 Categories: Italian, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 tb Butter
      2 tb Vegetable oil
  2 1/2 lb Pork rib roast (see note
           -below)
           Salt
           Fresh ground Black pepper
  2 1/2 c  Milk
 
  If among the tens of thousands of dishes that constitute the recorded
  repertory of Italian regional cooking, one were to choose just a
  handful that most clearly express the genius of the cuisine, this one
  would be among them. Aside from a minimal amount of fat required to
  brown the meat, it has only two components, a loin of pork and milk.
  As they slowly cook together, they are transformed: The pork acquires
  a delicacy of texture and flavor that lead some to mistake it for
  veal, and the milk disappears to be replaced by clusters of
  delicious, nut-brown sauce.
  
  Note: The cut of meat specified above includes the rib bones to which
  the pork's loin is attached. Have the butcher detach the meat in one
  piece from the ribs and split the ribs into two or three parts. By
  having had the loin boned, you can brown it more thoroughly, and by
  cooking it along with the bones, the roast benefits from the
  substantial contribution of flavor the bones make.
  
  Another cut of pork that is well suited to this dish is the boneless
  roll of muscle at the base of the neck, sometimes known as Boston
  butt. There is a layer of fat in the center of the butt that runs the
  length of the muscle. It makes this cut very juicy and tasty, but
  when you carve it later, the slices tend to break apart where the
  meat adjoins the fat. If you don't think this would be a problem, you
  ought to consider using the butt because of its excellent flavor and
  juiciness. Should you do so, substitute 2 pounds of it in one piece
  for the 2 1/2-pound rib roast.
  
  Do not have any fat trimmed away from either cut of meat. Most of it
  will melt in the cooking, basting the meat and keeping it from
  drying. When the roast is done, you will be able to draw it off from
  the pot, and discard it.
  
  1. Choose a heavy-bottomed pot that can later snugly accommodate the
  pork, put in the butter and oil, and turn on the heat to medium high.
  When the butter foam subsides, put in the meat, the side with fat
  facing down at first. As it browns, turn it, continuing to turn the
  meat every few moments to brown it evenly all around. If you should
  find the butter becoming very dark, lower the heat.
  
  2. Add salt, pepper, and 1 cup of milk. Add the milk slowly lest it
  boil over. Allow the milk to come to a simmer for 20 or 30 seconds,
  turn the heat down to a minimum, and cover the pot with the lid on
  slightly ajar.
  
  3. Cook at a very lazy simmer for approximately 1 hour, turning the
  meat from time to time, until the milk has thickened, through
  evaporation, into a nut-brown sauce. (The exact time it will take
  depends largely on the heat of your burner and the thickness of your
  pot.) When the milk reaches this stage, and not before, add 1 more
  cup of milk, let it simmer for about 10 minutes, then cover the pot,
  putting the lid on tightly. Check and turn the pork from time to time.
  
  4. After 30 minutes, set the lid slightly ajar. Continue to cook at
  minimum heat, and when you see there is no more liquid milk in the
  pot, add the other 1/2 cup of milk. Continue cooking until the meat
  feels tender when prodded with a fork and all the milk has coagulated
  into small nut-brown clusters. Altogether it will take between 2 1/2
  and 3 hours. If, before the meat is fully cooked, you find that the
  liquid in the pot has evaporated, add another 1/2 cup of milk,
  repeating the step if it should become necessary.
  
  5. When the pork has become tender and all the milk in the pot has
  thickened into dark clusters, transfer the meat to a cutting board.
  Let it settle for a few minutes, then cut it into slices about 3/8
  inch thick or slightly less, and arrange them on a warm serving
  platter.
  
  6. Tip the pot and spoon off most of the fat there may be as much as
  a cup of it being careful to leave behind all the coagulated milk
  clusters. Add 2 or 3 tablespoons of water, and boil away the water
  over high heat while using a wooden spoon to scrape loose cooking
  residues from the bottom and sides of the pot. Spoon all the pot
  juices over the pork and serve immediately.

           Pepper
      2 T  Butter
    1/4 c  Shallot; minced
      2 ts Dijon mustard

  Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, flatten the pork between sheets of
  waxed paper to about quarter-inch thickness.  Season both sides of
  the pork with pepper.  Melt the butter in a heavy large skillet over
  medium-high heat.  Add the pork and saut until it is brown and
  cooked through, about four minutes per side, then transfer them to a
  plate. Add the shallots to the same skillet, and cook for 30 seconds.
  Mix in the mustard and chicken broth and simmer until it is red uced
  by one-quarter, about five minutes. Stir in the maple syrup and
  vinegar. Simmer until the liquids are reduced to sauce consistency,
  about five minutes longer. Return the pork and accumulated juices to
  the skillet. Cook until they are just heated through, about one
  minute.  Arrange the pork on a platter. Spoon sauce over and serve.

  Note:  The sweet-and-sour sauce complements the pork deliciously.

      Title: PORK MIGNONNES WITH ORANGE & GREEN PEPPERCO
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lg Navel oranges
      1    Juice
      5 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Sunflower oil
  1 1/2 lb Boneless pork top loin --
           Sliced, 1/2" thick
           Salt, to taste
           Pepper, to taste
      1 tb Orange liqueur -- Grand
           Marnier prefer
      1 ts Green peppercorns -- drained
           And rinsed
      1 c  Beef stock
           Parsley sprigs
           Orange
 
  1. Remove zest (orange part only) from navel orange (reserving
  orange) and sliver in fine julienne. Blanch zest in boiling water to
  cover for 10 minutes, dropping whole juice orange into water during
  final minute to warm it (and maximize amount of juice yielded). Drain
  zest and juice orange and reserve. Squeeze juice orange to obtain
  about 1/3 cup juice. In a small, heavy, enameled or teflon-coated
  saucepan over low heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Stir in
  sugar until sugar melts and mixture turns golden. Add orange juice
  and zest and cook over low heat until sauce is thick. Reserve sauce.
  
  2. Divide peeled navel orange into sections, and reserve sections at
  room temperature. In a large, heavy skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of
  the butter plus the oil until hot. Season pork with salt and pepper
  and, raising heat to high, saute meat rapidly on both sides until
  browned and cooked through (about 2 minutes per side). Add liqueur;
  it will bubble and quickly reduce to a glaze. Remove pork from
  skillet, place in serving dish, and keep warm. (Tent with aluminum
  foil and place in a turned-off oven.)
  
  3. Lower heat, add green peppercorns to skillet and crush them with
  the back of a spoon. Add stock. Turn up heat to high and, stirring
  constantly, rapidly reduce liquid to 1/3 cup. Add reserved orange
  sauce and salt and black pepper to taste; reduce heat to a simmer and
  cook 2 more minutes.
  
  4. Cut remaining 2 tablespoons butter in small pieces and, with pan
  off heat, swirl into skillet one by one. Pour any juices yielded by
  pork into sauce. Place orange sections in sauce. Nap pork with sauce
  and orange sections and garnish with fresh parsley sprigs.

      Title: PORK RIB CROWN ROAST
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Original source was The
           -Complete Cook by Pat
           -Jester.
 
  This may take a couple posts. Now, don't preheat the oven. Put it in
  oven fat side up and roast uncovered at 35o F but cover the stuffing
  after 30 min with a bit of foil (Sausage-Corn Stuffing coming up
  later). 3-4 lbs takes 2 -2 1/2 hrs, bone in and I'd insert a meat
  thermometer 30 min before end of roasting (be sure the tip does not
  touch the bone or sink into fat) and keep cooking till 165 F (72 C)--
  test in several places to be sure.
  
  Done? O.K. Make a tent of foil, take out of oven and let stand for
  10- 15 min (Temp reads 170 F (75 C) after standing). Oh, if you
  happen to run one 4-6 lbs (which I doubt as you are doing an intimate
  dinner); go 2 3/4- 3 1/2 hrs. Make or buy a few little circles of
  paper and snip vertical lines down the sides; place on the bone tips
  for the "crown." Hey, you can propose on this one (but expect to do
  plenty of cooking for her --VBG)!
  
  Oh, carving: Remove any stuffing or veggies from center of roast and
  carve down between the ribs to serve the chops. I know, obvious; but
  I'm an obvious kind of gal. Need to know every little thing and I am
  not insulting your intelligence; just doing what I'd want done for me.
  
  Seasoning: When I say "seasonings,"  I would go with 2 tsp dried leaf
  thyme, 1 tsp dry mustard, 1 tsp celery seed, and 1/4 tsp garlic
  powder.
  
  Alternative seasoning: 2 tsp Italian herb seasonings, 1/2 tsp garlic
  salt, 1/4 tsp cracked pepper, 1/4 tsp ground lemon peel
  
  Alternative seasoning: 1 tsp dried leaf sage, 1 tsp dried leaf
  rosemary, 1 tsp dried marjoram, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion
  salt
  
  Note: you might also try 1 tsp of ground ginger added to alternative
  # 1.

  in a heavy pot, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes to heat through
  and blend flavors. Pour contents of the pot into the bowl of your
  food processor and process - using a pulsing action. Do not puree. If
  the pork roast had a fair amount of fat, the butter may not be
  necessary - use your own judgment. If butter seems needed because the
  pork is very lean, stir in the softened butter at this point. Pour
  into 3-4 small crocks. Refrigerate to cool. Melt butter and pour a
  thin layer over the top of rillette in each crock. Refrigerate until
  butter sets.

 Categories: Korean, Main dish, Pork, Meats, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Pork shoulder or other lean-
           -pork
      2 ea Scallions
      1 ea Clove garlic
      1 tb Sesame oil
      1 tb Sesame seeds
      1 tb Sugar
           Dash black pepper
      4 tb Kochu chang
 
  This dish is fairly spicy: it gets its highly seasoned flavor from
  kochee chang (Red Bean Paste, found in many Oriental food stores. If
  it is not available, Japanese miso sauce amy be substituted).
  Although the amount indicated is recommended, it is possible to use a
  little less.
  
  1.  Cut the pork into 4 or 5 slices about 1/4 inch thick.
  
  2.  Mince the scallions. Mince or crush the garlic. Combine both
  ingredients with the remaining seasonings in a bowl. Add the pork
  slices and mix well until all sides of the pork are coated.
  
  3. Grill immediately or marinate until ready to serve. It is
  important that the pork be well done; the outside should be dark,
  almost charred. A charcoal, an electric or an oven grill may be used.

      Title: PORK ROAST BARBEQUE
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           SEE DIRECTIONS:
 
  I am becoming convinced that *simple* is better. I am on a quest to
  develop bbq techniques that use a handful of ingredients to deliver
  the bbq taste we all crave. To that end, here is the rub and baste I
  used today: (BTW, the bbq drew raves by my most severe critics...my
  family.) :-)
  
  BBQ Pork Roast
  
  Prep: Wash roast and pat dry. Rub a thin layer of prepared table
  mustard over the entire surface. Then sprinkle on this rub (makes
  enough for a four pound roast):
  
  1 Tbl Lawry's Garlic Salt - Coarse Ground with Parsley 1 Tbl Cracked
  black pepper 1 Tbl Paprika 2 tsp Celery salt
  
  Mix well and "rub" it in to the meat if you want. I just "press" it
  into the meat here-and-there with my fingers. Let the roast stand for
  at room temp for about an hour (if you want to dry marinate it
  longer, be sure to refrigerate the meat, then bring it to room temp
  before cooking.)
  
  I cooked this on a Weber kettle using both charcoal briquets and
  hickory chunks. I filled my chimney starter about 2/3 full of
  Kingsford briquets and topped it off with a couple of baseball size
  chunks of hickory. When the hickory started to really blaze, I dumped
  the fuel into the Weber and moved it all to one side. I put a pan
  with water opposite the coals, replaced the cooking grid, and put the
  roast over the pan of water. The bottom vents were 3/4 closed and the
  top vent fully open. After 30 minutes I rotated the roast 180 degrees
  and spray-basted it with this mixture:
  
       12    oz. Apple juice 2 tsp Lemon juice
  
  I continued to rotate and baste the roast every 30 minutes for three
  hours, adding a couple of water-soaked hickory chunks to keep the
  smoke flowing. At the three hour mark I added another 2/3 chimney
  starter full of blazing briquets and hickory chunks.
  
  Right about that time, my wife called (from her mother's house) and
  said, "Supper better be ready when I get home." Since she would be be
  home in an hour, I figured I better check the temp of the roast. I
  *almost* panicked when the thermometer read 140 degrees, but I got a
  grip and let my imagnation and common sense kick in. I removed the
  roast and cooking grid, put the water pan in the middle of the
  cooking grate, and made two piles of coals on either side of the pan.
  Then I put the roast over the water pan and cranked the bottom vents
  all the way open. Every ten minutes from then on, I turned the roast
  and sprayed it liberally with the baste.
  
  When the boss got home, the roast was done. It was juicy and tender,
  it tasted like bbq, and I didn't get clobbered with a rolling
  pin....Life is good.

  Contributed to the echo by: Frank Damiano Pork Roast Stuffed With
  Sausage And Spinach Lay pork roast out flat, fat side down, and
  decide whether you can fill it like a jelly roll or whether you must
  cut some of the meat from the center so that you have room for the
  stuffing. <If you have to remove some meat dice and mix with sausage
  meat.>
  
  Wash,chop and quickly fry the spinach in olive oil. Drain. <If you use
  frozen spinach, defrost, drain and squeeze it dry before frying.>
  
  Salt and pepper the meat. Place the sausage, spinach, eggs, cheese and
  onion in the center of the roast. Roll up the roast, and tie it like a

    3/4 lb Pork loin
  1 1/3 oz Pork fat
      4    Black mushrooms

     24    Green peas
 
  Filling: dice the pork, fat, mushrooms, and bamboo shoot. Place in
  bowl. Add liquids and seasonings and stir well. Throw filling against
  inside of bowl for 3-4 minutes so ingredients combine thoroughly.
  Divide into 24 portions.
  
  Place one filling in center of won ton skin. Cup skin up around
  filling but don't close - 'make a waist'. Place one green pea in the
  center of the filling.  Use knife to compress and even out filling
  until below top edge of skin. Place in steamer about half inch apart.
  Steam for six minutes on high.  Remove. Serve.
  
  You can use beef, shrimp, quail eggs, or sweet rice for the above.
  
  You can get 'won ton' and 'dumpling' skins as well as egg roll
  wrappers at local chinese groceries.  You can make your own; but
  ready-made fresh or frozen ones are quicker.

  makes up a marinade of lemon juice and good quality olive oil,
  oregano and/or thyme, pepper, crushed garlic & maybe a little dry
  white wine. Marinate the pork overnight, then grill til just cooked,
  not dry. Eat as is, straight from the skewers, or remove meat and
  serve in pita bread pockets, with tomato wedges, onion slices, and
  Tzatziki, passing salt and additional freshly ground black pepper.

   Leave the top open so that you can see some of the meat. For fun you
  might put 1 frozen green pea on the top of each for added color.
  
   Steam in an oiled bamboo steamer for 15 minutes, on high heat.
  
   NOTE:  You can also add a bit of shrimp to this dish.
   It adds a great deal of flavor.  Try about 1/2 cup of chopped fresh
  shrimp.

      Title: PORK WITH CELERY & ORANGE
 Categories: Meats, Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Lean end belly of pork
      2    Pig's kidneys, (5 oz each)
      3 sm Oranges
      1    Head of celery
      1    Onion
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
           Parsley and rosemary
      1    Bay leaf
           A little yeast extract
           Flour and dripping
 
  Halve and core the kidneys.  Soak them in acidulated water for 1 hour
  then drain and dry.  Bone the pork, reserve the rind and cut the
  flesh (there should be at least 1 lb.) into large cubes. Grate the
  zest of all 3 oranges and squeeze the juice from 2.  Measure the
  juice and add enough yeast extract dissolved in hot water to make 8
  fl. oz. of liquid in total.
  
  Seal the pork briskly in a little hot fat and transfer to a casserole.
  Slice the kidneys thickly, dust with flour, brown in the hot fat and
  add to the casserole. Tie together 3 sprigs of rosemary, 6 bruised
  parsley stalks and a bay leaf, and bury the bouquet among the meats.
  Roughly chop the onion and fry it briefly. Sprinkle on 1-1/2
  tablespoons flour and pour on the liquid. Bring to the boil,
  stirring, and add to the casserole. Add plenty of salt and pepper,
  the crushed garlic and orange zest. Cut the celery into large chunks
  and add it to the casserole - do not stir it in. Lay the pork rind,
  fat side down, on top of the celery, and put a sheet of greaseproof
  paper over that. Cover with the lid and cook at 325 F (160 C) gas
  mark 3 for 1-1/2 hours, then at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for a
  further 45 minutes.
  
  Remove and discard the paper, rind and bouquet of herbs. Stir the
  casserole to mix the ingredients and add the flesh of the reserved
  orange, cut into V-shaped segments and ruthlessly stripped of all
  membrane. Cover with fresh greaseproof paper and the lid; cool
  quickly and chill overnight.
  
  Remove surface fat and reheat the casserole gently but thoroughly for
  serving.  Check seasoning and garnish with fresh chopped parsley.

      Title: PORK WITH FERMENTED BEAN CURD
 Categories: Loo, Chinese, Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
  1 1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 lb Boneless pork (loin
           -or butt) in 1" cubes
      1 cl Garlic, mashed
      1 tb Soy sauce
      5    Scallions, rinsed,
           -green parts only
      2    Pcs fermented bean curd
      3 tb Dry sherry
 
  Bring liquids to a boil. Add pork, garlic, and soy. Reduce heat and
  simmer 30 min, skimming crud off occasionally. Slice the scallions
  into 1" pieces and dump them in. Add the bean curd and mash it around
  until it's incorporated in the sauce. Add sherry (if you use more
  bean curd, use less sherry; if you use less bean curd, use more
  sherry). Continue to simmer until pork is tender, 15 to 30 min more.
  You may put a slice or two of ginger in with the garlic, but my
  mother never did that.
  
  This dish should have visible fat. The sauce should be thin and have a
  slightly curdled look to it. To pay lip service to western
  sensibilities, you might consider serving it surrounded with a
  stir-fried green vegetable (my mother used spinach). Warning: do not
  even think of making this dish with totally lean meat! It just won't
  work - the meat will be stringy and tasteless. Butt or fresh bacon is
  the traditional way, but the fattier and gristlier ends of loin,
  after all the stir-fryable parts have been cut away, will do.

 Categories: Pork, Low-cal
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Pork loin center rib roast
           -(8 ribs)
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper; coarsely ground
    1/2 lb Rhubarb, fresh; chopped
           -(2 cups)
    1/4 c  Apple juice concentrate;
           -thawed
      2 tb Honey
           Nutmeg, ground
      2 tb ;Water
      1 ts Cornstarch
 
  Have the butcher loosen the pork roast backbone, if possible, for
  easier carving.  Rub the roast with salt and pepper. Place bone side
  down in a small, shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into
  the thickest portion of the roast; make sure bulb doesn't touch bone,
  fat, or the pan. Roast, uncovered, at 325 F. until the thermometer
  reads 150 F., about 75 to 90 minutes.
  
  For the sauce, in a medium saucepan stir together the rhubarb, apple
  juice concentrate, honey, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil; reduce the
  heat, cover, and simmer ten minutes or until the rhubarb is very
  tender. Mix the water and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture.
  Cook and stir until the sauce is thickened and bubbly. Continue
  cooking for two minutes more.
  
  When the meat thermometer registers 150 F., spoon some of the sauce
  over the roast.  Continue roasting until the thermometer reads 170
  F., about 30 to 45 minutes more. Spoon on additional sauce
  occasionally. Let the roast stand 15 minutes before carving.  Heat
  any remaining sauce and pass with the roast.
  
  MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Prepare and roast the pork as directed. For the
  sauce, in a 1 1/2-quart microwave casserole cook the rhubarb, apple
  juice concentrate, honey and nutmeg, covered, on HIGH until the
  rhubarb is very tender, about five to seven minutes.  Mix the water
  and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture. Cook, uncovered, until
  the sauce is thickened and bubbly, about one to two minutes, stirring
  every 30 seconds. Continue cooking for one minute more. Spoon over
  the roast as directed and pass the remainder with the roast.

      Title: PORK WITH TARRAGON SAUCE (M_C-TX)
 Categories: Pork, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/4 lb *pork tenderloin or 4-6
           -boneless pork chops or
           -backbone
    1/4 ts *salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/4 c  Dijon - style mustard
      1 tb Butter or margarine
    1/2 ts Tarragon leaves - fresh is
           -best (use a little more)
           -but can use dried
    1/3 c  Canned beef broth undiluted
    1/2 c  *whipping cream (or mocha
           -mix + 1 teaspoon corn
           -starch)
           *salt and pepper to taste
 
  *These are in the original recipe, which also uses a 1 1/4 pound pork
  tenderloin. I have modified it by using the chops. We also omit the
  salt and use Mocha Mix or other non-dairy creamer for a "healthier"
  version (and add 1 teaspoon corn starch to thicken) in place of
  cream. Cut tenderloin or chops into 1 inch slices, trimming fat.
  Place meat between sheets of waxed paper and with side of fist, pound
  slightly to flatten. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and brush with
  mustard. Brown in melted butter in heavy skillet (slowly), 5 minutes
  each side until pinkness disappears entirely. Remove meat to heated
  platter and keep warm. Sprinkle tarragon over bottom of pan; add beef
  broth and heat to boiling,whisking to scrape up brownings from bottom
  of pan. Boil 2 minutes. Add cream. Boil, whisking until reduced and
  thickened.  If using non-dairy creamer, add corn starch to creamer
  first to avoid lumps. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if desired.
  Pour sauce over cooked meat and serve immediately. This recipe came
  from Debbie Campbell, in Chicago, who put together a book of her
  families and friends' favorites.  As we do now, I've tried some
  low-fat and no-sodium modifications for us, and we still love it--
  it's fast and very tasty!

    500 g  Minced pork
      2 c  Sultanas
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
     10    Green (spring) onions,

  The next four posts should come in handy on the next holiday when
  you're faced with yet another turkey to fix. One is from the US, the
  rest are from other parts of the world. The Argentine Creole Stuffing
  looks *very* interesting.  All these assume you know how to stuff and
  cook a turkey.
  
  Plump sweet sultanas marry well with turkey meat, the pork mince adds
  richness and moistness and the generous quantity of fresh herbs lifts
  this stuffing out of the ordinary.
  
  Melt butter and gently fry minced pork until it changes colour,
  pressing out lumps with a fork.  Add to the rest of the ingredients
  and mix well.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  4 1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  Oatmeal; * see note
    1/2 c  Dried fruit
           (raisins, apples, apricots,
      1 ds Ground nutmeg
      1 ds Ground mace
      1 ds Ground cinnamon
 
  Recipe by: McDougall Bring water and fruit to a boil. Slowly add
  cereal to boiling water while stirring. Reduce heat to low, cook,
  stirring frequently, 15 to 30 minutes. The longer the ingredients
  cook, the softer they will be.
  
  The porridge should be like a thick soup. Do not add milk at the
  table.
  
  HELPFUL HINTS: Most health food stores sell many kinds of whole grain
  cereals. Follow directions on package, but increase the amount of
  water by 1/2 cup for every two servings.
  
  For added flavor, add a sprinkle of nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, or any
  combination of these. From the collection of Sue Smith, S.Smith34,

      Title: PORRO'S ONE POT OLYMPIC POULTRY
 Categories: Poultry, Vegetables, Easy
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Ingredients:
           Chicken or Turkey parts to
           -match servings desired.
      1 qt Chicken Broth or Chicken
           -Soup
      1 ts Cilantro
      1 ts Ground Correander Seed (only
           -if you don't use Cilantro!)
      1 tb Oregano
    1/4 sm Onion chopped
      1    Clove garlic minced
    1/4 c  Cooking wine (bitter orange
           -or other fruit is best)
      1 ts Ground White pepper
      1 tb Crushed Red pepper (subst.
           -Cayenne)
      1 ts Sweet Basil (optional, I
           -like it)
    1/4    Lemon with rind on
      1 c  Rice uncooked (I don't use
           -pre-cooked type, but either
           -works)
 
  Choose your large cast iron pot (my usual) or in my case now with no
  stove, a West Bend electric fry pan.
  
  Set to simmer and add chicken soup. (I use egg drop by the way, but
  that's another step) While broth is warming, wash chicken as you
  usually do. Add all seasonings except the peppers. Squeeze the lemon
  for it's juice and toss it in without the seeds. When you can see
  that the broth is just starting to boil every time the light goes
  out, you know it's just right, below boiling temp. You don't want
  this to boil unless you are in a hurry, want to do lots of pot
  watching or you like tough chicken. No need to add salt or sugar
  since there is usually more than enough already in the soup. The
  chicken should not be covered in liquid, this is not intended to be
  soup when you get done.
  
  When you have the temp. fine tuned to true simmer, place the poultry
  parts in the broth, meaty side up as possible. Sprinkle on the white
  and red pepper, cover the pot and ignore it for as long as you wish
  the longer the better, I usually shoot for at least 4 hours. Before
  serving at least 20 min. before you want to eat, flip the meat and
  add the rice. Check to make sure there is enough water, bring up to
  original level if necessary. This should turn out fairly thick, and
  not soup because the rice absorbs most or all of the liquid. Stir it
  in well and cover again. When the rice is done it's finished. Spoon
  out rice onto plates and place poultry on the side of it. I like to
  serve this with a large tossed salad, using Olive Oil, 1 T lemon
  juice, 2T Oregano, and 1 clove garlic, or garlic powder. (See Porro's
  Italian Salad for details)
  
  I use Cajun seasoning, but wanted this to have a more general appeal,
  if you like it hotter, go for it. Sort of a Cajun/Italian recipe.
  Some other notes and options. 2 t of parsley won't hurt. Also
  optional: (it's not cast in stone, add what you like) fresh sliced
  mushrooms. I confess, I never measure any of the above, it's all done
  by taste, do the same please! Anytime you use fresh spices it will
  taste better.
  
  Why I make and eat this. 1) For sporting events, one never knows for
  certain when it will be time to eat. Also if you have company that
  shows up late on a regular basis, this type of cooking and be on hold
  for extended periods of time, without harm. 2) No stove. 3) The slow
  cooking will make even a laying hen edible. 4) For a whomped up one
  pot, one plate dinner it actually has some taste to it.  5) Sometimes
  I want something that is easy and doesn't need tending, this is it.
  Probably best for family cooking rather than guests. 6) When I was
  cooking for three teens I never knew if any two would every be at
  home for dinner at the same time. It keeps well for hours after
  adding the rice.

MMMMM-------------------------MUSHROOMS------------------------------
      2 lg Portobello mushrooms (6 oz)
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Minced shallot
      2 tb Balsamic vinegar
           Salt (to taste)
           Black pepper (to taste)

MMMMM-----------------------MUSHROOM BROTH----------------------------
      1 ts Minced garlic
      1 ts Minced shallot
      1 tb Olive oil
      3 oz Red wine
      4 c  Vegetable stock

MMMMM--------------------------RISOTTO-------------------------------
      3 tb Diced onion
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Arborio rice
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground black pepper
      1 c  Warm vegetable stock
      1 tb Olive oil
 
  To prepare the mushrooms:  Remove stems from mushrooms. Set stems
  aside for mushroom broth.  Wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp
  cloth. Combine olive oil, shallot, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.
  Toss mushroom caps in the mixture to coat well.  Grill or broil
  mushrooms until tender, about 10 minutes.  Cut into nickel-size
  chunks; set aside. (Mushrooms can be made ahead and refrigerated).
  
  To prepare mushroom broth:  Mince reserved mushroom stems; set aside.
  Saute garlic and shallot in the olive oil until translucent. Add
  minced stems. Saute a few minutes more. Pour in red wine and increase
  the heat, stirring until almost all the wine has evaporated. Add
  stock. Lower the heat and simmer uncovered about 25 to 30 minutes or
  until the liquid is reduced by one-fourth.  Set aside.  (Broth can be
  made ahead and refrigerated. Reheat before using in risotto.)
  
  To prepare risotto:  Cook the onion in the oil until soft but not
  browned. Add the rice; stir until it is coated. Cook, stirring, until
  a toasted aroma develops. Stir in salt and pepper. Add the reserved
  mushroom stock in several additions, stirring the rice frequently and
  letting most of the stock be absorbed before adding more. If you do
  not have enough mushroom stock, finish making risotto with stock.
  Cook until the rice is almost tender and most of the liquid is
  absorbed. Stir in oil and reserved mushrooms.

  salted water, add the sun-dried tomatoes and the pasta (Penne
  recommended), cook until al dente, about 13 minutes; reserve 1 1/2
  cups of pasta water and drain the tomatoes and pasta. In a large
  bowl, toss the pasta with 1 cup of the reserved pasta water, the
  mushroom mixture, goat cheese, Parmesan, and the rest of the olive
  oil. If the pasta seems dry, add more of the pasta water. Serve

  another minute; then the tofu. Add a splash of sake, stir for another
  minute or two as the steam melds everything, then pour on the sauce.
  Stir until it thickens (about 3 minutes), then serve with rice or
  noodles.
  
  The portabellos have a chewey, firm body and a rather strong flavor,
  very nice!  I think next I'll try some kind of dish mixing whole caps
  with eggplant...I'll let you know in a week or so!
  
  as always, "eat! eat!"

      Title: PORTERHOUSE STEAK IN A SKILLET
 Categories: Beef, Information
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
           Porterhouse steak
           -1" to 1 1/2 " thick
    1/4 c  Olive oil
           Black pepper
      2 tb Butter
           Juice of 1/2 lemon
 
  1. A good thick (1 to 1 1/2 inch) porterhouse easily will feed two to
  four people, unless they are starving lumberjacks or threshers. So
  buy one steak for every two (or four) people, the day before you plan
  to cook it. It benefits by spending a day in a good olive-oil bath.
  
  2. Pour 1/4 cup of the best quality olive oil over eack steak, along
  with a generous grind of coarse black pepper. Let the steak marinate,
  refrigerated, for 8 to 12 hours, turningoccasionally. If the steak is
  frozen, it may take as long as 24 hours to thaw, and the best way to
  do it is in an oil bath.
  
  3. When you are ready for the best steak that you've ever eaten, heat
  that black iron skillet over high heat until it's almost red hot. I
  use an old Wagner skillet that's 11 inches across with the ridges on
  the bottom that give those great grill marks to the steak. (Somehow
  those grill marks make any steak taste better). Two big porterhouse
  steaks will fit in my skillet at the same time. If I need to cook
  more than two, I use the broiler in my oven or my barbecue grill.
  
  4. Put the steak in the hot skillet and stand back! It's going to
  sizzle some, and smoke a little - it could even set off your smoke
  alarm. Cook the steak for about 2 minutes, then turn it 90 degrees
  and cook another 2 minutes. Turn the steak and repeat the process for
  the second side. The total cooking time is about 8 to 10 minutes.
  
  5. If a steak is to be cooked past the rare stage, turn the heat down
  after the second position so that the outside won't char before the
  inside is cooked to the desired degree ofdoneness. When the steak is
  well seared, with a nice crust on one side, turn it and sear the
  other. Reduce the heat to medium and cook to the desired degree of
  doneness. An instant-read thermometer is a must for cooking all kinds
  of meat.
  
  6. Remove the cooked steak to a heated serving platter. Remove the
  pan from the heat to cool slightly, then return to low heat and add 2
  tablespoons butter and the juice of half a lemon to make a simple
  lemon-butter sauce that adds a nice zip to the flavor of the steak.
  
  7. If you are using a black iron skillet with the ridges on the
  bottom, stirring with a basting brush will help mix the lemon butter
  and, at the same time, incorporate the steak drippings that have
  drained down between the ridges of the skillet. Pour the sauce over
  the steak, garnish with a sprig of chopped parsley and serve
  immediately. A good steak doesn't like to be kept waiting.

      Title: PORTERHOUSE STEAK WITH RED WINE SAUCE
 Categories: Beef, Sauces, From cook4u, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Porterhouse steak
           About 2 1/2-in. thick
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3 tb Butter
      1 tb Shallots, chopped
    1/2 c  Burgundy or cabernet
    1/2 c  Brown sauce or
           Canned brown beef gravy
 
  1. Select a very heavy skillet for this. A heavy, traditional black
  iron skillet is excellent. Sprinkle the steak on both sides with salt
  and pepper. Use a fairly generous amount of black pepper. Pat with
  the fingers to make the seasoning adhere. 2. Heat the oil in the
  skillet and when quite hot, add the steak. The primary goal is to
  sear the steak well on both sides over moderately high heat. Cook the
  steak on the first side about 5-7 min. until it is quite dark without
  burning. Turn the steak and cook about 10 min. on the other side,
  until quite dark but not burnt. 3. Reduce the heat slightly and turn
  the steak again. Cook about 10 min., then turn the steak again.
  Continue cooking, turning as necessary. The total cooking time
  recommended is about 45 min, from start to finish. 4. Remove the
  steak from the skillet and cover loosely with foil. Let rest so that
  the internal juices are redistributed. 5. Meanwhile, pour off the fat
  from the skillet. Wipe lightly with paper towels. Add 1 tbsp of
  butter to the skillet and stir to dissolve the browned particles that
  cling to the bottom. Add the shallots and cook briefly. 6. Add the
  wine and boil to reduce about 30 sec. Stir in the brown gravy and
  reduce to 2/3. Remove from the heat and swirl in the remaining
  butter. 7. To serve, spoon a little of the sauce onto each of 4 hot
  plates. Slice the steak and place the slices on the sauce.

      1    Bay leaf
      1    Clove
 
  Remove the zest of 2 of the oranges with a zester; or pare finely
  with a vegetable peeler, then cut into thin julienne strips. With a
  very sharp knife, cut off the skin and outside membrane of all the
  oranges, so you have glistening orbs of golden pulp.  Do this over a
  bowl to catch escaping juice.
  
  Choose a saucepan just large enough to hold 2 oranges at a time and
  put in the escaped juice and remaining ingredients. Dissolve the
  sugar and simmer for 5 minutes. Submerge 2 oranges at a time and cook
  just long enough to warm them through - about 3 minutes. If they bob
  up, place a small weighted saucer over them. Remove to a serving dish
  and continue with the next pair until finished.
  
  Boil to reduce the syrup by half, drizzle over the oranges, and chill.

      Title: PORTUGAL: FISH STEW (CALDEIRADA DE PEIXE)
 Categories: Seafood, Soups/stews
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Fish; whatever available or
           - shellfish
      2 pn Salt
      4 tb Olive oil
      2    Onions; chopped
      8    Tomatoes; peeled & chopped
      1    Green pepper; seeded &
           - chopped
      4 lg Cloves garlic; crushed
      1 pn Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
      3 ts Piri-piri sauce
           - see recipe
      1 sm Glass dry white wine
      1    Handful coriander leaves;
           - chopped
      4    Slices of bread with the
           - crusts cut off
 
  This is a real fisherman's stew, dependent on whatever the boats have
  brought in.  The spices and hervs give the dish its special Portuguese
  identity.
  
  Clean the fish and cut into fairly small pieces, removing as many
  bones as possible.  Sprinkle the salt over the fish and leave while
  you make the following sauce. Heat 2-3 Tbsp of the oil in a saucepan
  and stir in the onions, tomatoes and pepper. Cook gently until they
  start to soften, then put in the garlic, nutmeg, allspice and
  piri-piri sauce. Add the wine and a little water. Cook for about 5
  minutes, stirring frequently, then remove from the heat. Lightly oil
  the bottom of a shallow, ovenproff dish (preferably earthenware). Put
  in a layer of fish followed by a layer of sauce and sprinkle with
  coriander. Continue with these layers until the ingredients are used
  up. Cover the top of with the bread and sprikle well with the
  remaining oil or dot with a little butter. Cook in a pre-heated oven
  at 350 degrees F. for about 30 minutes or until the fish is tender.
  Serve with boiled or sliced and fried potatoes, bread and a slad to
  make a substantial main meal. If you cannot obtain coriander leaves,
  you can use fresh parsley instead, but this will alter the flavour of
  the dish.

      Title: PORTUGUESE ALMOND & POTATO CAKE
 Categories: Portugal, Cakes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 lg Baking potato, about 10
           -ounces
      1 c  Almonds, with skins
      2 ts Baking powder
      3 lg Eggs, separated
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened
      1 tb Brandy
    1/2 ts Almond extract
           Powdered sugar
           Marzipan "potatoes,"
           -optional (see recipe)
 
  Bake or microwave potato until soft.  Force pulp through a coarse
  sieve or potato ricer.  There should be 1 cup lightly packed. Set
  aside to cool.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter sides of an 8 1/2-inch spring form pan,
  line base with a circle of baking parchment; butter the parchment.
  Using a nut mill, grind almonds to powder, stir in baking powder; set
  aside.
  
  Beat egg whites until they start to stiffen, sprinkle with half of the
  sugar, a little at a time, and continue beating until stiff and
  glossy.
  
  Beat butter with remaining sugar, then beat in egg yolks, brandy, and
  almond extract.  Using a large rubber spatula, fold in potato, ground
  almonds and egg whites.
  
  Spoon into prepared pan; bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until a tester
  comes out dry.  Let cool in pan for 10 minutes.
  
  Run a knife blade around edge before releasing sides of pan. Place
  cake, on the base, on a rack and let cool completely. Cake will sink
  slightly in the middle.  Reverse cake onto a plate, peel off paper
  and place right side up on a serving plate.  Dust with powdered sugar
  before serving.
  
  MARZIPAN "POTATOES":  You'll need 4 ounces marzipan or almond paste
  and powdered unsweetened cocoa.
  
  Pinch off pieces of marzipan and roll into elongated balls, each
  about the size of a large marble.  Make these slightly irregular,
  like tiny new potatoes. Roll in cocoa to simulate brown potato skin.
  Cut several in half to show the white interior.  Arrange a little
  group on top of the cake, and place the rest in twos and threes
  around the edge of the plate.
  
  Serves 10.

      1 c  Sugar
      4 lg Eggs, at room temperature

      4 ts Instant coffee powder
      1 tb Vanilla extract
      2 c  Unsalted butter, softened
           -(no substitutions)
 
  Prep time:  1-1/2 hours plus cooling Baking time: 10 to 12 minutes per
  batch
  
  Cake Wafers
  
  Cake wafers:  Preheat oven to 350 deg. F.  Invert two (or more if you
  have them) 9-inch round cake pans; grease and flour bottoms of pans.
  
  Beat butter in mixer bowl until smooth.  Beat in sugar until light and
  fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
  Beat in vanilla. Beat in flour and salt just until combined.
  
  Spread 1/3 cup batter evenly on each inverted cake pan to within 1/4
  inch of edge.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes, until lightly browned around
  edges. With long, thin metal spatula, loosen each wafer and transfer
  to wire racks to cool completely.  Repeat on buttered, floured pans
  with remaining batter to make a total of 12 wafers. (Can be made
  ahead. Stack between sheets of wax paper and cover tightly, up to 2
  days.)
  
  Coffee buttercream:  Heat milk in medium saucepan over medium heat
  just to boiling.  Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks and sugar together in
  medium bowl. Gradually whisk in hot milk. Return mixture to saucepan;
  cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until mixture
  thickens and coats back of spoon, about 6 minutes. (Do not boil.)
  Strain through sieve into mixer bowl.  Stir in coffee powder and
  vanilla. Cool to room temperature. Beat in 2 cups butter, 1
  tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition.
  
  To assemble, place 1 cake wafer on serving platter. Spread evenly
  with 1/3 cup buttercream.  Add second wafer and 1/3 cup more

      Title: PORTUGUESE ROAST TURKEY
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1    (10-lb) fresh turkey
      2 lb Coarse (kosher) salt
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Olive oil
      2 lg Garlic cloves
           - peeled and minced
      1 lb French or Italian bread
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
  3 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 lg Egg yolks
 
  REMOVE THE GIBLETS from the turkey for another use. Fill the neck and
  body cavities of the turkey with coarse salt, then rub the skin well
  all over with salt. Place the turkey and remaining coarse salt in a
  large deep kettle, adding enough cold water to just cover the bird.
  Set in a cool spot for 3 to 4 hours.
  
  TO PREPARE THE STUFFING: Put the butter and olive oil in a large heavy
  saute pan, or better yet, a kettle, and place it over moderate heat.
  When the butter is melted, add the garlic and cook for 3-5 minutes
  until limp. Meanwhile, tear the bread into small chunks. Add the
  bread and the fine salt and pepper and toss well. Pour in the chicken
  stock and beat hard with a wooden spoon until the mixture is
  pastelike. Turn the heat to its lowest point, cover the kettle and
  steam 15-to-20 minutes until the bread absorbs all the liquid. Add
  the egg yolks to the stuffing mixture and beat hard until smooth.
  Remove from the heat and reserve. Preheat oven to 400F. Drain the
  turkey and rinse several times in cool water so that all traces of
  salt are gone. Place the bird on the counter with the neck cavity
  facing you. With your hands, begin working the skin free from the
  breast. Proceed gently, taking care not to tear the skin. It's slow
  going at first, but once you begin to free the skin, the job goes
  quickly. Loosen it all the way down the bird to within about 1 inch
  of the tail end, down both sides. With your hands, push the stuffing
  bit by bit far down under the skin and continue, packing it in
  lightly, until the breast is covered with about a 1-inch layer. Next
  fill the neck cavity, skewer the neck skin flat against the back to
  enclose, and truss the bird. Place the turkey breast-side up in a
  large shallow roasting pan without a rack and roast uncovered for
  about 2 1/2 hours. Do not baste. When the bird is richly browned and
  a leg moves easily in the hip joint, remove from the oven. Let stand,
  uncovered, 20 minutes. Drain drippings into a sauce boat and keep
  warm. Remove trussing string and skewers and serve at once on a
  warmed platter.

  I saw this in Bon Appetit yesterday and decided to keep it. I'll bet a
  dollar to a doughnut that the recipe originally called for Linguica,
  but was changed to kielbasa for the masses. If you can't find smoked
  Linguica or Kielbasa, Andouille would also be a good substitute. I
  hope to try this when it gets cooler (like October -- grin)! Hope it
  appeals to you, too.
  
  Number of Servings:   8
  
  Combine all ingredients in large pot.  Bring to boil, stirring

      2 pk Active dry yeast
  1 1/4 c  Warm water (110 - 115
           -degrees), divided
    3/4 c  Sugar, divided
    1/3 c  Low fat dry milk
  5 1/2    To 6 cups bread flour,

      1 ts Salt
      3    Eggs, slightly beaten
    1/2 c  (1 stick) butter, room
           -temperature
      1    Egg for glaze
           -coarsely granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Dried currants (optional)
 
  Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the water in large bowl of mixer.
  Sprinkle 1 tsp of the sugar on top and let stand until bubbly, about
  5 minutes. Stir in remaining water, sugar, dry milk and 2 1/2 cups of
  the flour. Beat on medium speed 2 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to
  slow, and add salt, eggs and butter. Blend well. Add remainder of
  flour a little at a time. When dough begins to get stiff for beaters,
  change to dough hook. Enough flour is added when mixture forms a soft
  ball which gathers around dough hook and follows hook around bowl. If
  mixer doesn't have a dough hook, mix by hand with a spoon. Add flour
  in a circle around bowl, rather than in the middle. Knead dough on
  slow speed 5 minutes or 8 - 10 minutes by hand. Put dough in greased
  bowl, turning to grease top. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in
  warm place until double, 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Punch down dough, divide
  into halves. CARACOIS (SMALL LOAF): Use half of dough. Roll into rope
  about 25 x 1 1/2 inches. Twist rope and coil into greased round layer
  pan. 9 x 1 1/2 inches, to form a snail shape. TRANCA A TRICANA (BRAID
  LOAF): Use half of dough.  Work 1/4 cup dried currants into dough.
  Cover with towel and let rest 30 minutes. Divide dough into 3 equal
  parts, roll each into a 14 inch rope.  Lay ropes side by side on
  greased baking sheet. Starting in middle and working out to each end,
  weave into thick braid. Pinch ends together and turn under slightly.
  TO BAKE: Cover and let rise until double, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Heat
  oven to 350 degrees. Brush top with beaten egg, sprinkle with coarse
  sugar. Bake until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Makes 2 loaves

      2 lg Cans of hominy

           Or stock
      2    Or 3 green chiles (roasted
           And peeled)

           Be sure to check the peppers
           For bits of peel

      1 lg 1015 onion, diced
      3    Or 4 large carrots, diced
      3    Or 4 stalks of celery,
           Diced

  Yet another appropriate Thanksgiving dish is Posole, which is
  indigenous to the Native American southwest. Posole is really
  considered most traditional around Christmastime and is always served
  New Year's Eve and/or New Year's Day for good luck.  However, Pueblo
  peoples have made posole for generations and it is a staple winter
  dish. I have adapted it for vegan use. Please adjust everything to
  taste; my tastes are for more spice and chiles than most folks would
  care for, so I add more of almost everything. Also:  the fresher
  ingredients will make an amazing difference in the taste of the
  posole, so if possible, prepare your own vegetable stock, roast your
  own fresh Anaheim or New Mexico chiles, and buy flash frozen posole
  (also spelled pozole) corn in the store, rather than using canned.
  
  Saute the onions and celery until the onion is transparent. This can
  be done with water and veggie stock or with spray-type coatings. Dump
  everything else in and bring to a low boil. Simmer until you like the
  texture.  The hominy should be really soft, almost to the
  break-up-and-really-form-a-thick-stew stage.
  
  I serve posole with cornbread and a crisp green salad. If you wish to
  add any animal protein, the original recipes call for pork or ham. I
  have found that chunks of turkey work wonderfully with this recipe.
  
  Please consider your tolerance for spices.  The heat will come from
  the green chiles and the chile powder, as well as the black pepper.
  Finally, if you want a little more color in the stew, you could throw
  in some kernel corn.  Hope you enjoy.

 Categories: Main dish, Meats, Game, Southern
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Young, fat possum
      2 T  Butter
      8    Sweet potatoes
      1 T  Sugar
           Salt
 
  First, catch a possum.  This in itself is excellent entertainment on a
  moonlit night.  Skin the possum and remove the head and feet.  Be
  sure to wash it thoroughly.  Freeze overnight, either outside or in a
  refrigerator. When ready to cook, peel the potatoes and boil them
  tender in lightly salted water along with the butter and sugar.  At
  the same time, stew the possum until tender in a tightly covered pan
  with a little water. Arrange the taters around the possum, strip with
  bacon, sprinkle with thyme or marjoram, or pepper, and brown in the
  oven. Baste often with the drippings.

 Categories: Soups, Oz
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Small possum or bandicoot*
      2 l  Water
      1 ts Salt
      1 ea Tin corn*
           Any other vegies desired
      1 pn Celery leaves
      1 pn Parsley
           Flour or gravox* to thicken
           Fried bread,1 slice per serv
 
  Skin and clean possum or bandicoot, then quarter the animal. (Video
  tape this please. I have no idea how to do it. Also "first you have
  to catch a possum or bandicoot", but then that's another story.)
  Place it in a large pot or camp oven along with water and salt. Cover
  and simmer gently for 3 or 4 hours. (Tough little devils apparently.)
  Add vegetables and simmer for another 1 1/2 hours (Still tough. Even
  the vegies are resisting being associated with this.) Strain soup
  through a large holed colander when meat has left bone and remove
  bones, especially small ones. Return soup to the pot and add parsley
  and celery leaves. Thicken with a little flour or gravox. Cut fried
  bread into 1 inch squares and serve soup over toast,boiling hot.
  
  *For those of you that haven't met a bandicoot, it is something
  between a possum and a raccoon, sort of, I think, maybe.
  
  *Tin of corn? Well a can I guess, 16 oz.
  
  *Now, when you boil this meat for 5 1/2 hours, strain it and throw it
  away, it does make me wonder why you started in the first place.
  
  *Gravox is a meat concentrate seasoning I think. The dish must be
  need some flavor.
  
  *Fry the bread any way you want to.
  
  *All things considered, a brick or stone would be a reasonable
  alternative if you don't happen to have a possum or bandicoot
  available.

MMMMM--------------------------THE LAMB-------------------------------
      2    Lamb racks, 8 chops each **

           -removed
 
  Postrio's is a swank SF eatery.  I've never been there, but the place
  gets rave reviews.  This recipe is from chef Anne Gingrass. The olive
  sauce in this lamb dish looks very interesting. Might be a good
  choice for the festive season rushing upon us.
  
  The sauce:  Saute the garlic, shallots lots and peppercorns in 1
  tablespoon butter until lightly browned, Add the Madeira and red
  wine, rosemary and tomato.  Simmer until reduced by two-thirds,
  leaving about 1 cup total.
  
  Add the demi-glace and return to a boil.  Whisk in remaining butter a
  little at a time until it is incorporated. If you wish a thicker,
  richer sauce, add more butter. Strain sauce through a fine strainer,
  then transfer to a blender.  Add half the olives and puree until
  almost smooth. Roughly chop the remaining olives and add to the
  sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside in a warm
  place until serving time.
  
  The lamb:  Rub racks well with olive oil and season with salt, pepper
  and rosemary.  Let come to room temperature.
  
  Heat a roasting pan or large saute pan until very hot. Add a few
  drops oil and sear the lamb racks in it on all sides until brown.
  Place the racks bone side down in the hot pan and transfer to a 400F
  oven. Roast to medium rare, or to desired doneness, 10 to 20 minutes.
  
  Let lamb rest for 15 minutes, then slice into 8 chops per rack. Serve
  4 chops to a plate (nap napped with a bit of sauce) with garlic mashed
  potatoes and lightly cooked vegetables of your choice.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  "Although pot-en-pot contains the same ingredients as fricot, the
  method of preparation is signficantly different. The most commonly
  used meats for this dish are chicken and hare but beef, pork, duck or
  goose may also be used. In Cheticamp and on the Magadalen Islands,
  pot-en-pot is called Etouffrage."
  
  POULTINES BLANCHES: In a bowl, mix flour with salt and baking powder.
  Gradually add cold water to the dough as one would when making
  biscuits. Roll the dough fairly thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares and
  place in fricot or other dish. Cut the meats into pieces. Place the
  pieces in a large pot with the salted water and bring to a boil.
  Simmer until the meat is tender. Remove the meat from the pot,
  reserving the stock.
   In the bottom of a second large pot, place a layer of potatoes, a
  layer of meat, a layer of chopped onion Season with salt, pepper and
  summer savory and continue adding until there are no ingredients left.

      4 lb Flat cut brisket of beef
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
  1 1/2 ts Pepper
      2 lb Onions, halved & sliced
    1/2 c  Drained, dried, marinated
           -tomatoes, chopped

      1 lb Carrots, peeled, cut 1/2"
    1/2 lb Celery, cut 1/2" diagonally
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves, crumbled
 
   1. Preheat oven to 350 deg f. Line large shallow pan with foil,
  extending over sides by at least four inches.
   2. With hands, rub brisket with garlic, 1 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp
  pepper. Spread half the onions in the bottom of the roasting pan.
  Sprinkle with dried tomatoes. Mix wine and vinegar together and pour
  into pan. Top with beef, fat side up. Cover with remaining onions.
  Crimp foil loosely around but not over the beef.
   3. Cover pan with more foil, crimping tightly over the edges, (or
  use a roasting pan with a lid). Bake for four hours.
   4. Meanwhile in a large bowl, combine remaining vegetables, butter,
  thyme and remaining salt and pepper. Spread vegetables evenly in a
  jelly roll pan. Cover with foil and crimp to seal on edges. After two
  hours of roasting beef, add vegetable dish to oven. After an hour,

      Title: POT ROAST/CROCK-POT
 Categories: Beef, Main dish, Casserole
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Chuck roast; trimmed
      1 pk Lipton onion soup mix
  2 1/2 c  Water
      1 ea Med Onion; sliced
      1 ea Sm Carrot; cut into 3 pieces
      2 ea Celery; chopped
      1 c  Garlic
      2 ea Sm Red potatoes
 
  I like to brown the meat and the veggies, it gives the gravy more
  flavor. It's not absolutely necessary though. Place the meat into the
  crockpot, then the veggies; sprinkle on the onion soup mix and pour
  water over the top. Cover and cook on LOW for 8-10 hours or until
  meat is tender. Once the meat is done, if you want to thicken the
  gravy, remove the meat and veggies from the pot and place them on a
  serving platter. Mix together 2 tablespoons flour (I like Wondra
  Flour, it never lumps...no need to mix with water) and 2-3
  tablespoons water to make a paste; whisk the paste into the hot
  liquid until thickened. You may want to put the temperature on HIGH
  when you make the gravy. It might be hard to find a 1-1/2 lb roast
  but it's not impossible. There are only two of us and I always make a
  big roast and freeze the leftovers or make other dishes with it

 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour *
      1 c  Water *
      2 oz Cabbage (1/2 cup cooked and
           - chopped)
    1/2 lb Lean ground pork
      1    Green onion, chopped
      1 ts Chopped ginger
      1 tb Tientsin Preserved Vegetable
           - rinsed and chopped
      2 tb Oil
      1 c  Chicken stock

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONING------------------------------
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Sugar
      1 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Oyster sauce
      1 ts White wine
           Dash of pepper
      2 ts Cornstarch

MMMMM----------------------------DIP---------------------------------
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Hot spiced oil
      1 ts White Vinegar
 
  Combine flour and cold water in large mixing bowl. Mix thoroughly to
  form dough.  Cover with damp cloth; let stand for 20 minutes. *
  
  Cook cabbage 2 minutes in boiling water.  Rinse in cold water, and
  drain. Squeeze dry of all excess moisture. Chop fine; set aside.
  
  Place the ground pork, chopped green onion, chopped ginger, and
  preserved vegetables together on chopping board. Mix and chop with
  the clever for approximately
       15    strokes.
  
  Add "seasoning" and the cabbage to the pork mixture and mix
  thoroughly.
  
  After dough has set for 20 minutes, knead it for 1 minute and then
  form into 2 to 3 rolls, approximately 1-1/2 inch in diameter. Cut
  each roll of dough into slice 1-1/2 inch thick.
  
  With a small rolling pin, or heel of hand, flatten each piece of
  dough into a thin patty, 3 inch in diameter. Place 1/4 tablespoon of
  the pork mixture in the center of each patty. Fold in half, and seal
  the edges by pressing firmly together with your fingers. (Help
  ready-made skins to seal by applying egg white to the edges.)
  
  Set each pot sticker with the straight edge on a platter, pressing
  firmly so as to form a flat base. Each pot sticker should be made to
  stand upright, rather than allowed to rest flat on its side.
  
  Heat frying pan and add 2 tablespoon oil.  On medium heat, pan-fry pot
  stickers.  Cook on the base surface only. Pan-fry 2 minutes, until
  the base side is nicely browned.
  
  Add 1 cup chicken stock to the pot stickers.  Cover and cook over
  medium heat for approximately 7 minutes, until most of the chicken
  stock is absorbed.  Remove to platter.
  
  Mix thin soy sauce, hot spiced oil, and white vinegar to use as
  condiment for Pot Stickers.
  
  * Pot sticker skins can be purchased at Chinese groceries.

      Title: POT STICKERS (KUO TEH) PART 1
 Categories: Chinese, Dim sum, Yee
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Yield: 4 doz.

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      4 c  Sifted all purpose flour
      1 c  Warm water + 2 tbsp

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lb Ground pork;fresh
      1 pk Chopped spinach;frzn (10 oz)
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Sherry
      1 tb Sesame oil
  1 1/4 ts Salt
      3 tb Green onions;minced
      3 tb Ginger;fresh;minced
      3 tb Chinese parsley (cilentro)
           -minced

MMMMM----------------------------DIP---------------------------------
      2 tb Light soy sauce
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Vinegar
 
  TO MAKE DOUGH: Mix flour with warm water and knead for 10 to 15
  minutes. There is no need to add any flour on the board as you knead
  because the dough should be at a perfect consistency. Let dough rest
  for 20 minutes while you make the filling. TO MAKE FILLING: Partially
  thaw spinach and lightly squeeze out liquid (leave some liquid with
  the spinach). Mix with rest of ingredients. WRAPPING: Divide dough
  into 4 parts. Roll each part out to about 12 inches in length and
  divide into 12 balls. Roll each ball into 3 inch round flat discs and
  drop 1 tbsp. of filling in center. Fold the dough over the filling,
  pinching together just the top to make a half circle. On the side
  nearest you, form 2 to 3 pleats on each side and pinch them to meet
  the opposite side to seal. Continued in Part 2.

 Categories: Chinese, Dim sum, Yee
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Directions, continued.
 
  COOKING: Heat 2 tbsp. of oil in a 12 inch heavy skillet over medium
  high heat. Lightly brown Pot Stickers until golden on the bottom,
  pour 1 cup water into the skillet and cover immediately. Cook over
  medium heat until most of the liquid is absorbed. Uncover and
  continue cooking until liquid is completely absorbed and the Pot
  Stickers are golden brown on the bottom. Serve with dip. Another good
  dip is chili oil. DO AHEAD NOTES: Wrap and freeze them. Cook just
  before serving. Pot Stickers turn out even better when the freezing
  process gives the filling additional moisture, making them juicier
  and tastier! Add 5-7 more minutes to cooking time if frozen.
  COMMENTS: To prevent Pot Stickers from actually sticking to the
  bottom of the pan, it is best to use either a Teflon, a heavy bottom
  commercial aluminum, a cast iron or a well seasoned steel skillet.

      Title: POT STICKERS FILLING
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Ground pork
    1/2 sm Head Chinese (napa) cabbage,
           Cored and chopped
      1    Green onion, coarsely
           Chopped
      2    Thumb-size slices fresh
           -ginger
      2    Water chestnuts, chopped
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
           Pinch white pepper
      1 ts Oriental sesame oil
      5 tb Vegetable oil, divided
      1 c  Water
 
  Combine pork, cabbage, green onion, ginger, water chestnuts, salt,
  sugar, white pepper and sesame oil, and refrigerate until read to use.
  
  Fill pot stickers by spooning 1 level tablespoon of filling into
  center of each pancake.  Fold dough over to make half-circle and
  pleat edges firmly together. Pinch shut to seal, then decoratively
  mark with the point of a dinner knife.
  
  To pan-fry, heat cast-iron or wok or other heavy-bottom skillet over
  moderate heat.  Add 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, swirling to coat
  bottom. When oil is hot, place pot stickers, seam side up in skillet
  and agitate (shake) for 30 seconds.  (You may need to do this in two
  batches.)
  
  Pour in 1 cup water, cover, and gently boil over moderate heat for 7
  to 8 minutes.  When oil and water start to sizzle, add remaining 2
  tablespoons oil, if needed. Tip skillet to distribute oil evenly;
  watch carefully (uncovered) to prevent sticking.  When bottoms are
  brown, remove from heat and carefully lift out pot stickers with
  spatula.
  
  To serve, turn pot stickers over (dark side up) and arrange on serving
  platter.  Serve with dipping sauce.
  
  TIPS: When cutting into these in recipe testing, we discovered the
  pork filling appeared pink in some, even though the meat was done.
  
  You can freeze uncooked pot stickers for later use but remember to
  squeeze out the water from cabbage during preparation (in a colander
  or cheesecloth).  Freeze pot stickers separately on cookie sheets
  until firm, then put them in plastic bags.
  
  When rolling out the pancakes, leave the centers slightly thicker
  that the edges.  A thicker center will hold up better during the
  browning.
  
  If you prefer, steam pot stickers for about 12 minutes over boiling
  water instead of pan-frying.

      Title: POT-ROASTED SALMON WITH OLIVES & PRESERVED LE
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Salmon Cutlets
           Olive oil
           Salt and pepper
      4    Carrots
      6 oz Green Beans
      4 oz Pitted Black Olives
      1    Preserved Lemon
      6 oz Fish stock
      1 tb Chopped Parsley
 
  Preserved lemons are salted lemons - cut a vertical cross in each
  lemon and stuff with sea salt - preserve in lemon juice for a few
  weeks in an air-tight jar. If you don't have them use ordinary
  lemons. The advantage of the preserved ones is their mildness and
  tenderness, so you can eat them. The unpreserved ones tend to be too
  bitter. If you don't have fish stock use 3 oz each white wine and
  water.
  
  Method: Brown the fish in olive oil using the casserole you will use
  for the roasting. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Peel and
  trim the carrots and cut lengthways into thin strips. Top and tail
  the beans and roughly chop the black olives. In the same pan lightly
  colour the vegetables in hot oil. Add the black olives and preserved
  lemon, cut into eight segments, and toss in the oil.
  
  Pour over the stock, bring to the boil, lower the heat, lay the fish
  on top and cover with the lid, and tinfoil if using. Cook over a
  moderate heat for eight minutes, basting the fish twice during the
  process. Remove the fish and keep warm. Continue cooking and
  vegetables with the lid off until tender. Serve with the fish on top
  and sprinkling of parsley.

  You have given me so many soup recipes, I thought you might like this
  one. I use it as is or as a base for Clam Chowder, Corn Chowder, or
  any soup that calls for a cream base. Saute onions in butter until
  transparent, add flour and mix well.  Then add 3 cups chicken stock,
  stir well and simmer slowly.  In a separate pot put the other 3 cups
  chicken stock, potatoes, leek and bring to a boil.  Let simmer for 20
  minutes. Then mix both pots, add the cream and check for seasoning
  {salt}. Top with parsley. Makes 6 servings. Nancy/Crockett CA/12:26

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Medium potato, grated (1 cup
    1/4 c  Resh horseradish; grated
    1/4 c  Nion; grated
      2 tb All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Oil for frying
 
  Wring out grated potato to remove as much water as possible by
  scooping about 1/4 cup of potato into your hand; squeeze firmly.
  Place potato flesh in medium size bowl. Add remaining ingredients to
  grated potato; mix until well blended. Heat oil in a large, heavy
  skillet until it is almost smoking. Pat 2 tablespoons of grated
  potato mixture into a flat disk about 2-inches in diameter. Repeat,
  leaving about 1 inch between pancakes. Cook until bottom is browned
  and beginning to char, about 2 minutes. Turn; cook until second side
  begins to char, about 2 minutes. Remove to warm plate. Repeat with
  remaining grated potato mixture. Serve hot or warm, accompanied by
  apple sauce. Adapted from Alan Harding, Nosmo King, New York Potato
  pancakes with a horseradish punch are great way to work spring into
  your menu. Fans of the tear-inducing fumes that rise from freshly
  grated horseradish can tell you how they clear your head. What a
  culinary way to drive out wintery thoughts as we move into the new
  season! Fresh horseradish is rich in vitamin C and volatile oils.
  These oils are the cause of its pungent bite. This bite gives an
  interesting flavor-lift to potato pancakes. Alan Harding, chef at
  Nosmo King restaurant in New York, is serving spring latkes, or
  pancakes, made from a blend of grated celery root, potato,
  horseradish and onion. Since both celery root and horseradish are
  bitter, I find that using 1 or the other makes pancakes with more
  balanced flavor. Also, their texture is more velvety. Harding serves
  his crunchy, fried latkes on top of a crisp green salad. It's a nice
  change from croutons. They also make a zesty accompaniment to roast
  leg of spring lamb or roast beef.

      2 tb Chopped parsley
 
  In a bowl, combine sauce ingredients.  Place in refrigerator to chill.
  Prepare grill or griddle.  Boil potato in water over medium heat until
  tender, about 10 min. Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients in a
  medium bowl.  Drain potato and mash with a fork or masher. Add potato
  to bowl, mix well and form into 4 thin patties. If potato mixture is
  too dry to hold together, add a little water before making patties.
  Grill patties 4 to 5 min. on each side until lightly browned. Serve
  on hamburger buns with sauce and your choice of fixings.
  
  I don't have a grill so I broiled mine instead and they turned out
  great! Brown and crispy!  These have a nice taste.

 Categories: Mcdougall, Vegetarian, Digest
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2    To 1 raw onion grated
      4 lg Potatoes grated
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/4 c  Water
 
  Mix all ingredients in a bowl.  Using a non-stick pan on medium heat,
  or a griddle at 325 degrees, ladle the mixture on pan and mash down
  until flat about burger thickness. Cook for 8-10 minutes. Turn over
  and cook 5-8 minutes.
  
  Hints: Use a food processor to grate the potato and onion. The onion
  may get gooy but that's o.k. Ore Ida has hash browns that are already
  grated, and I've been meaning to try that as a time saver but haven't
  done it yet. If any one has done this please post your success. If
  you want to double this recipe, use separate bowls or it is too hard
  to mix, I've already tried. These freeze well. I usually think of one
  potato as a serving. For two people the above recipe could be dinner
  and lunch. Top with all your favorite low fat condiments. It
  surprised us at how much these taste like Real hamburgers with all
  the toppings.

      Title: POTATO CAKES (BAKESTONE RECIPES)
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Cooked floury potatoes
      1 ts Salt
      2 oz Butter, softened
      4 tb Self-raising flour
      1    Butter for filling
 
  Potato cakes are eaten with bacon and sausages.  It's easier to make
  them with hot, freshly cooked potatoes. If using cold potatoes, melt
  the butter before adding it. Choose a floury type of potato, and boil
  in well-salted water. -- Drain the cooked potatoes well, then return
  to low heat in the same pan:  put a dishcloth over the pan and allow
  the potatoes to dry for 5-10 minutes.  (This is called "drying in
  their steam" in Ireland.) They should be dry and floury at the end of
  the process. Sieve or rice into a mixing bowl with the salt. Beat in
  the butter. Work in sufficient flour to make a soft dough which is
  easy to handle. Turn onto a floured board and roll or pat out to 3/4
  inch thick. Cut into rounds with a 3-inch scone cutter.  Place on the
  hot greased bakestone and cook over a moderate heat until golden
  brown underneath. Turn and cook the other side. Remove from the
  bakestone, split, butter generously, and close again. Keep warm while
  cooking the next batch. Serve hot. (Re "self-raising flour": in
  Ireland and the UK, this is flour which comes with baking
  powder/baking soda already included.  For this recipe, about 1/4-1/2
  t of baking powder mixed with a plain all-purpose flour will
  substitute nicely.)

 Categories: Indian, Appetizers, Nibbles, Side dish, Potatoes
      Yield: 12 "chops"
 
  1 1/2 lb Potatoes, boiled & mashed
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Garam masala -OR-
    1/2 ts Ground cumin -AND-
    1/2 ts Ground coriander
      1 tb Chopped fresh coriander
           -- (US = cilantro)
      1 sm Onion, very finely chopped
      2    Green chillies, finely
           -- chopped
    1/2 ts Grated fresh ginger root
           Oil spray for cooking
 
  CONVERSIONS: 1 lb = 16 oz = 450 g
  
  ABBREVIATIONS: ts = teaspoon
                 tb = tablespoon
                 sm = small
  
  Mix all ingredients (except oil spray) together well. Divide into
  portions (as many as specified in "yield") and shape each into a
  thick flat round.
  
  Heat a large frying pan (skillet). Spray with a little oil or grease
  lightly. Cook 3-4 potato cakes at a time, depending on how large the
  pan is.
  
  Do for about 5 minutes on each side until golden - DO NOT disturb them
  until the 5 minutes is up or you will spoil the crust. When they have
  been cooking 5 minutes try and lift them gently with a spatula. Lift
  rather than scrape, and flip over, remembering that they will still
  be very soft in the middle. If you like, use another spatula placed
  over the top of the chop to keep it together whilst turning over.
  
  Keep them warm in the oven at a moderate heat (375 F, 190 C, Gas 5)
  while you cook the others. Recipe from Quick and Easy Indian Cooking
  by some man whose name I can't remember with a 70s hairstyle. He is
  the same one who makes khoya out of powdered milk.

      Title: POTATO CREPES
 Categories: Pancakes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Russet potato, boiled in
           -its skin until tender
    1/8 ts Salt or to taste
           Freshly ground pepper, to
           -taste
      2 tb All purpose flour
      1    Egg
    1/4 c  Plus 1 tablespoon milk
      1 tb Oil
 
  Here's a recipe that looks elegant enough for "Gourmet". I'm posting
  it here in "Cooking" as well. I'd call it "California Cuisine" as it
  uses non-Oriental ingredients with both Chinese and European cooking
  techniques. The potato crepes are fancy potato pancakes while the
  seafood is prepared by poaching in low temperature oil, then
  stir-frying++a Chinese technique. The author, Jay Harlow, says: "This
  cooking method, in which the seafood is cooked first by a kind of low
  temperature deep-frying, is a typical Chinese technique.  It may
  appear to use a lot of oil, but most of it is drained away and can be
  reused for other frying. The over all amount of oil remaining in the
  dish is no more than with other stir-fried dishes." Peel the potato
  and put it through a food mill or ricer. Season to taste with salt
  and pepper. Stir in the flour. Beat the egg and milk together, add to
  the potato mixture, and stir until smooth. Heat half the oil in a
  10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pout in half the potato
  mixture, shaping it into a thick pancake, 8 to 9 inches in diameter.
  Cook until well-browned, 2 to 3 minutes, turn and cook on the other
  side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with
  remaining oil and batter. Makes 2 crepes. From the San Francisco
  Chronicle, 2/13/91. Posted by Stephen Ceideburg; March 7 1991.

      1 tb Dry white wine
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
      1    Egg white
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/4 lb Scallops
    1/4 lb Salmon filet
           Potato crepes (see recipe)
  1 1/2 c  Peanut oil
      1 ts Minced fresh ginger
      1 tb Minced green onion
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 ts Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Rice vinegar
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Cornstarch dissolved in 1
           -teaspoon water
 
  Starting at the tip end, cut the asparagus into 1 1/2-inch lengths
  with a diagonal rolling cut:  slice off the tip at an angle, roll the
  asparagus about a quarter turn and cut again, and repeat on down the
  stalk until you reach the tougher base.  Discard the bases. Dissolve
  the cornstarch in the wine in a medium bowl; add the egg white and
  pepper and beat lightly. Remove the tough white muscle from the edge
  of each scallop and cut the scallops into 1/4-inch-thick discs.
  Remove any pin bones from the salmon and slice across the width of
  the slice (parallel to the backbone) into 1/4-inch-thick rectangles.
  Add the salmon and scallops to the egg mixture and toss gently to
  coat. Preheat the oven to 175F and set 2 dinner plates in it to warm.
  Prepare the Potato Crepes and place 1 on each plate. Keep warm in the
  oven. Have a clean, dry, heatproof container, such as a saucepan, on
  the stove with a heat proof sieve on top. Drain the scallops and
  salmon and discard the marinade. Heat a wok or deep skillet over high
  heat. When it begins to smoke, add the oil. Wait 30 seconds, then add
  the seafood (the oil will not be very hot yet; this is intentional).
  Cook, stirring gently to separate the pieces, until salmon has lost
  its raw color.  Pour the contents of the wok into the sieve. Return
  the wok to the heat, and in the bit of oil clinging to the pan,
  stir-fry the ginger and green onion until fragrant. Add the pepper
  and asparagus and stir-fry until it begins to brown.  Add the chicken
  stock, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar. Cover, and cook until the
  asparagus is crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes depending on size.  Remove
  the cover, return the seafood to the wok, and stir in the cornstarch
  mixture. Cook until the sauce is slightly thickened. Taste for
  seasoning and adjust if necessary, then divide the seafood, asparagus
  and sauce over the potato crepes. Serve immediately Serves 2. From
  the San Francisco Chronicle, 2/13/91. Note that the potato pancakes
  require the potatoes to be cooked and cooled ahead of time, which can
  be done earlier in the day or the night before. Posted by Stephen

      4    Turkey breasts (6oz)
      2    Baking potaotes; peeled, cut
           -in half, kept in water
    1/4 c  Dijon mustard
      1 tb Essence
           Olive oil for sauting
      2 c  Fried shoestring potatoes
           -tossed with Emeril's
           -Southwest seasoning
 
  Preheat the oven to 4450 degrees. For stuffing: In a saute pan, heat
  the olive oil. When the pan is smoking hot saute the onions,
  shallots, and garlic for 1 minute.  Add the jalapenos, celery, and
  corn. Continue sauting for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. In
  a mixing bowl, combine the sauteed vegetables, crumbled corn muffins
  and stock together, mix until incorporated. For the turkey: Using a
  small knife, make a 2-inch slit on the side of the breast, forming a
  pocket. Fill each pocket with about 1/2 cup of the stuffing.  Using a
  potato threader from Suzy Wong, thread the potatoes. Season each
  stuffed breast with Essence. Rub the entire breast with the Dijon
  mustard.  On a cloth napkin folded in half, cover the bottom half
  with the seasoned potato crust. Place the turkey in the center and
  fold over ther remaining crust over the breast. Roll the breast up
  tightly in the napkin.  This will help in holding the crust to the
  meat. In a saute pan, heat the olive oil.  When the pan is smoking
  hot, remove the napkin and add the potato crusted turkey. Saute for
  2-3 minutes or until golden on one side. Flip the meat over and
  finish cooking in the oven for 8-10 minutes.  Serve with shoestring
  potatoes.

    1/2 tb Yeast
      1 c  Lukewarm water
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Parsley
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Wheat germ
      3 c  Flour

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      3 md Potatoes, diced
  1 1/2 tb Olive oil
           Salt & pepper
           Olive oil, for brushing
           Parsley, chopped
 
  In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, water, sugar, salt, oil &
  parsley. Let stand until the yeast starts to froth. Mix in the wheat
  germ & 1 c flour. Beat well & let sit for 5 minutes. Knead in the
  remaining flour & knead until the dough is soft & pliable. Lightly
  oil a clean bowl & cover with a towel.  Let rise until doubled in
  bulk.
  
  Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet & saute the potaotes until
  they are soft.  Remove from heat & set aside. Preheat oven to 350F.
  
  Roll out the dough to fit into a cookie sheet or on a pizza stone.
  Lightly sprinkle the cookie sheet with cornmeal & place the dough on
  the sheet. Stretch into the corners & build up the edges slightly.
  Let rest for 10 minutes.
  
  Brush the dough with olive oil & spread the potatoes over the top.
  Generously salt & grind fresh black pepper over the top & finish with
  the fresh parsley. Bake for 25 minutes or until the crusts are done.
  Cut up & serve immediately or let cool.  This is equally good cold &
  served at room temperature.
  
  NOTE: I think that this recipe still needs something to pick it up a
  little if you have any ideas, please let me know. It is based on a
  recipe a friend of mine ordered in Glasgow in an Italian Restaurant,
  she apparently orders it a lot, I had never seen it before. There is
  a lot of starch, but don't let that put you off. I found it better
  cold than hot, but that may be my preference.

      Title: POTATO GALETTE WITH WILD MUSHROOMS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      6 oz Wild mushrooms, cleaned
  2 1/2 oz Goose fat or olive oil
           Salt and pepper
      3    Cloves garlic, chopped
      2    Shallots, chopped
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
      1 lb Potatoes, peeled
           8 inch heavy frying pan
 
  This galette was layered with fresh truffles in the days when they
  were cheap, but other fungi, particularly cepes, are a very acceptable
  substitute. Even cultivated mushrooms enliven an otherwise plain fried
  potato cake.  (Sherri's note, I used two jars of dried wild mushrooms
  (because I doubled the recipe) reconstituted with white wine
  overnight then drained). Cut the mushrooms in large pieces. Heat 2
  tablespoons of the fat or oil in a frying pan and add the mushrooms,
  salt and pepper. Saute briskly, stirring, until the mushrooms are
  tender and all moisture has evaporated; cooking time varies with the
  type of mushroom. Stir in the garlic, shallots and parsley and taste
  for seasoning.
  
  Preheat the oven to No. 5/375 degrees F./190 degrees C. Cut the
  potatoes in 1/8 inch/3mm slices, if possible using a mandolin slicer
  or a food processor, do not rinse potatoes after they are sliced.
  Heat 2 tablespoons of the fat or oil in the frying pan for 1 minute.
  Remove and arrange half the potato slices overlapping in circles.
  Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and spread the mushrooms on top.
  Cover the mushrooms with the remaining potatoes and spoon over the
  remaining fat. Press a piece of foil with a weight on top.
  
  Cook the galette on top of the stove until the underside starts to
  brown, 5 ~ 8 minutes.   Transfer it to the heated oven and continue
  cooking for 15 - 20 minutes until the potatoes are tender.
  
  Remove the foil and weight and flip the galette in the pan.
  Alternatively, slide it on to a plate, then tip it back into the pan.
  Continue cooking it until the underside is brown. It is best served
  at once, though it can also be reheated.

  ring about 4 inches in diameter. Arrange a second, slightly smaller
  ring on top of the first.  Form a second galette in the same manner.
  Brush the gallettes with oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake

 Categories: Italian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 lb Boiling potatoes; -=OR=-
  5 1/2 c  -Mashed potatoes
    3/4 c  Flour (or more)
      5    Egg yolks
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Salt; or as desired
           White pepper; to taste
    1/3 c  Olive oil
 
  USING UNCOOKED POTATOES, boil them, unpeeled, in salted water until
  soft. Or cook them in a microwave according to oven directions or
  bake in a conventional oven. Drain boiled potatoes. Peel potatoes
  when they are cool enough to handle and puree them through a food
  mill or potato ricer while still warm. Do not use a blender or food
  processor for this because it excites the gluten in the potato and
  makes a sticky mess. If using leftover mashed potatoes, place in a
  small pot and heat them until they are warm. Transfer potatoes to a
  mixing bowl, add the yolks and mix. Add nutmeg, salt, pepper and 3/4
  cup of flour. Knead together and add the remainder of the flour if
  necessary, bit by bit, kneading until a slightly sticky consistency
  is attained. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Form the dough
  into sausage-like rolls about the thickness of your thumb. Cut into
  pieces about 1-inch in length. Using a fork, flatten the pieces so
  that the tines leave an imprint in the gnocchi. Keep a glass of water
  nearby to clean the fork. Meanwhile, fill a 3-quart pot with salted
  water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat so that the water is boiling
  at a gentle roll. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water, about 16
  at a time. They will sink to the bottom but will rise to the surface
  after a minute or so. Continue to cook for another 15 seconds.
  Immediately remove with a slotted spoon to a colander. Sprinkle with
  a little olive oil, mix gently and transfer to a heated platter.
  Continue until all the gnocchi are cooked. Serve the gnocchi
  ungarnished as a side accompaniment to roast meat or poultry.

      1 ts Salt; or as desired
           White pepper; to taste
    1/3 c  Olive oil
 
  USING UNCOOKED POTATOES, boil them, unpeeled, in salted water until
  soft. Or cook them in a microwave according to oven directions or
  bake in a conventional oven. Drain boiled potatoes. Peel potatoes
  when they are cool enough to handle and puree them through a food
  mill or potato ricer while still warm. Do not use a blender or food
  processor for this because it excites the gluten in the potato and
  makes a sticky mess. If using leftover mashed potatoes, place in a
  small pot and heat them until they are warm. Transfer potatoes to a
  mixing bowl, add the yolks and mix. Add nutmeg, salt, pepper and 3/4
  cup of flour. Knead together and add the remainder of the flour if
  necessary, bit by bit, kneading until a slightly sticky consistency
  is attained. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Form the dough
  into sausage-like rolls about the thickness of your thumb. Cut into
  pieces about 1-inch in length. Using a fork, flatten the pieces so
  that the tines leave an imprint in the gnocchi. Keep a glass of water
  nearby to clean the fork. Meanwhile, fill a 3-quart pot with salted
  water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat so that the water is boiling
  at a gentle roll. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water, about 16
  at a time. They will sink to the bottom but will rise to the surface
  after a minute or so. Continue to cook for another 15 seconds.
  Immediately remove with a slotted spoon to a colander. Sprinkle with
  a little olive oil, mix gently and transfer to a heated platter.
  Continue until all the gnocchi are cooked. Serve the gnocchi
  ungarnished as a side accompaniment to roast meat or poultry.

      Title: POTATO HASH
 Categories: Side dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    450 g  Potatoes, cooked
     50 g  Butter or margarine
    100 ml Milk
           Salt and pepper
           Oil for frying
 
  Serves 2-3
  
  You can use leftover baked potatoes for this dish if you have them
  around. The simple device of browning a cake of mashed potatoes until
  it is golden on both sides is one of the most delicious ways of
  cooking potatoes. Warming, satisfying food.
  
  Mash the potatoes thoroughly with the butter or margarine, and beat
  to a smooth pure with the milk. Season well with salt and pepper.
  Put a little oil into a heavy bottomed pan and press the mixture down
  into it. Fry until the bottom is well browned, over a very low heat -
  about 20 minutes. Turn over and brown the second side for a further
  20 minutes or so. Turn out on to a warm serving-dish.

      4    Potatoes
      1 md Onion
      1    Egg
      2 tb Matzoh meal
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper, white

  add more potatoes for additional people keeping the 4:1 ratio.
  Description: Peel potatoes and place in cold water until ready to
  prepare latkes. Starting with onions, alternately grate some onions
  on large holes of grater and some potatoes on smallest holes. This
  will keep potato mixture from blackening.  (Or use food processor.
  The steel blade produces a smooth textured latke and the grating disk
  a crunchy one.) Press out as much liquid as possible and reserve
  starchy sediment at bottom of bowl. Return sediment to mixture, but
  not liquid. Blend potatoes with eggs, matzoh meal, salt, and white
  pepper. Heat 1" of oil in frying pan. Drop about 1 tb mixture for
  each latke into skillet and fry, turning once. When golden and crisp
  on each side, drain on paper towels. Serve with yogurt, sour cream,
  sugar, or applesauce.

  1.  Peel the potatoes if the skin is coarse; otherwise, just clean
  them well.  Keep them in cold water until ready to prepare the
  latkes. 2. Starting with the onions, alternately grate some of the
  onions on the large holes of the grater and some of the potatoes on
  the smallest holes. This will keep the potato mixture from
  blackening. Press out as much liquid as possible and reserve the
  starchy sediment at the bottom of the bowl. Return the sediment to
  the mixture.* 3. Blend potatoes with the eggs, flour, salt and white
  pepper. 4.  Heat 1" of oil in a frying pan. Drop about 1 tbs of
  mixture for each latke into the skillet and fry, turning once. When
  golden and crisp on each side, drain on paper towels. Serve with
  yoghurt, sour cream, sugar, or applesauce. Serves, 8-10. Note: You
  can freeze potato latkes.  After making them, place them on a cookie
  sheet, freeze, and remove to a plastic bag. When ready to serve,
  place in a 450F oven for several minutes.
  
  *The steel blade of a food processor or the grating blade are less
  painful ways of grating the potatoes and the onions. The blade makes
  a smooth consistency and the grater a crunchy one.

    1/2 ts Ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Sour cream
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh dill
 
  * peeled and thinly sliced (5 medium, see note)
  
  Soak salt cod overnight, changing water at least once.
  
  The next day, drain and place salt cod and milk in pan. In a sauce
  pan, cover and cook over medium heat 8 minutes. Remove salt from pan.
  Pour milk through strainer and set milk aside. Flake and discard any
  skin and bones. Set cod aside.
  
  Melt butter in clean saucepan over low heat. Add leeks and cook
  stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour.
  Stir in reserved milk, potatoes and pepper. Increase heat to medium.
  Cover and cook 15 minutes. Add cod and remove from heat.
  
  This soup may be made up to a day in advance to this point. Cool,
  cover and refrigerate.
  
  Place sour cream in small bowl. Reheat soup over medium heat until
  piping hot. Thin sour cream with 1/2 cup hot soup, then pour mixture
  into soup pot. Do not heat soup again or sour cream will curdle. Pour
  soup into tureen, sprinkle with fresh dill and serve.
  
  Note: Other white fish, such as fresh cod, halibut or flounder, be
  used, either in combination with salt cod or by themselves,
  
  Note: Use waxy, less starchy potatoes, such as new potatoes, low
  Finnish, Kennebecks, red rose or white rose, to avoid a mealy texture.

  cooked. Add the mashed potatoes and boiled peas (if used). Cook for
  another 2 minutes, until thoroughly blended.
  
  Garnish with finely chopped coriander leaves. Serve hot with Masala
  Dosai or puris.

      1    Envelope active dry yeast
      1 tb Plus 1/4 teaspoon granulated

      1 c  Milk
  1 1/4 ts Salt
      4 tb Butter
  3 1/4    To 3-1/2 cups unbleached or
           -all-purpose flour
      1    Egg, slightly beaten
      4 tb Butter, melted, for brushing
           -on the rolls
 
  Info:  posted by Perry Lowell, GOURMET/INTERCOOK, March '93 from
  "Sunday Suppers, Informal American Home Cooking", 1988 by Melanie
  Barnard & Brooke Dojny
  
  The potato in these rolls helps produce a smooth-textured grain and
  somehow adds a certain subtle tang to their taste. In other words,
  they taste so good that they're worth the effort --- especially if
  you are also yearning for the smell of bread baking in your kitchen.
  
  These rolls freeze very well after baking.  Wrap them in foil to
  reheat. Quick-rise yeast may be substituted. Rising times will be
  about half as long.
  
  Makes 24 rolls.
  
  1.  Peel the potato and cook it in a small saucepan of boiling water
  until tender.  Drain, discard the water, and mash with a fork. You
  should have about 1/2 cup of mashed potato.
  
  2.  Dissolve the yeast with 1/4 teaspoon of the sugar in the 2
  Tablespoons warm water and set aside until the yeast is bubbly, about
  5 minutes.
  
  3.  Heat the milk with the remaining Tablespoon of sugar and the salt.
  Remove from the heat, add the butter, and stir until melted. Stir in
  the mashed potatoes.
  
  4.  Place 3 cups of flour in a large mixing bowl and add the milk
  mixture, the yeast mixture, and the egg. Stir to combine well. Knead
  on a well-floured board or with a dough hook in a heavy-duty mixer
  until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.  Add enough
  additional flour to make a smooth, workable dough.
  
  5.  Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a
  warm place until doubled in bulk, about
    1-1/2    hours.
  
  6.  Punch the dough down.  Lightly butter two 8- or 9-inch round cake
  pans. Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces and shape each piece into
  a round ball. Arrange the balls of dough in the cake pans side by
  side, leaving about 1/4-inch between each roll.  Brush the rolls with
  some of the melted butter.  Let rise for 30 minutes at room
  temperature before baking, or cover loosely with plastic wrap and let
  rise in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.
  
  7.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Brush the rolls again with the
  remaining melted butter and bake in the preheated oven until a
  beautiful golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Serve hot.

 Categories: Breads, Pancakes, Ethnic
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      2 lb (6 medium sized) old
           -potatoes (the older, the
           -better)
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 lb (1 cup) flour
 
  This excellent soft pancake wrapper, easily made at home, is eaten in
  Norway with butter and 'geitost' cheese, or used to wrap delicious
  little morsels of smoked ham, 'fenalar', dried and salted leg of
  mutton, or a spoonful of berry conserve.
  
  You will need a griddle or a heavy frying pan, or best of all, a
  'takke'. Boil the potatoes in their skins. Peel them as soon as they
  are cool enough to handle and immediately mash them with the salt.
  Speed makes light pancakes.  Mix with the flour into a dough. (Less
  or more flour may be needed - potatoes are very variable. The less
  flour you use, the better.) Form into a long sausage and chop of
  lengths. Roll these pieces out into pancakes about 1/8 inch thick.
  
  Bake the 'lompe' on a hot iron surface.
  
  Yield:  Makes 10 to 12 small pancakes Time: 1 hour

      Title: POTATO PANCAKES (LATKES MY WAY)
 Categories: Heirloom, Potatoes, Fried, Jewish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Potatoes, medium
      2 md Onions, peeled
      2 lg Eggs, well beaten
      3 lg Tablespoons flour, cracker
           -meal, potato flour or
           -matzo meal
      2 ts Baking powder
 
  1. Pare potatoes; let soak in bowl of ice water for 2 or 3 hours,
  drain.
  
  2. Using fine grating disk of food processor, or the finest side of a
  four sided grater, grate potatoes into a medium bowl, grating the
  onions with the potatoes as you work. (The juice prevents the
  potatoes from darkening.)
  
  3. Drain mixture through a large sieve set over a large bowl. Squeeze
  handfuls of the potato/onion mixture over sieve, allowing liquid to
  drain into the bowl. Let the liquid from the potatoes stand a few
  minutes to allow starch sediment to collect in the bottom of the bowl.
  
  4. Meanwhile, mix the potato/onion mixture with the eggs, flour,
  baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt and dash of pepper. Add 1 tablespoon
  more flour, if needed to thicken mixture to consistancy of cooked
  cereal. Carefully pour or spoon off liquid from potatoes; add
  sediment only to the potato-egg mixture, stirring till just blended.
  
  5. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. In a 12" skillet, over medium high
  heat, heat 1/2" salad oil until hot but not smoking. Place heaping
  tablespoons of the potato mixture in the hot oil; with back of fork,
  flatten slightly. Fry about 5 pancakes at a time until golden,
  turning once, 3 minutes in all. Remove pancakes with slotted spoon;
  drain on paper towel lined baking sheet. Place in oven to keep warm
  while frying remaining pancakes. If desired serve pancakes with
  applesauce or sour cream.

  1 1/2 c  Shredded potato (can use
           Frozen "Simply Potato"
           Shreds)
      2 tb Oat flour (or 2T rolled oats

    1/4 c  Water
        pn Salt, fresh ground black
           Pepper
 
  Mix flour and water, add onions and potato. Add a bit more water if
  needed to form thick pancake batter. Fry till golden brown with some
  darker spots in non-stick pan with a 1/2 second spray of Pam. Serve
  with applesauce. Makes 4 large pancakes.
  
  From the Healthy Heart Handbook.
  
  I've had very good results with the plastic bags of frozen Simply
  Potato, a shredded potato that is the only one I could find without
  added oil. More costly than shredding your own potato, it saves time
  and also makes excellent hash browns (add onions, fry in non-stick
  pan, no oil).
  
  Putting a little rolled oats into a blender or coffee mill makes oat
  flour in a jiffy. No need to go out and buy and store oat flour.

      Title: POTATO PANCAKES (LATKES) (HEALTHY HEART)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Shredded potato (can use
           Frozen "Simply Potato"
           Shreds)
      2 tb Oat flour (or 2T rolled oats
           Milled into flour)
    1/4 c  Chopped onion (or 4T dried
           Onion)
    1/4 c  Water
        pn Salt, fresh ground black
           Pepper
 
  Mix flour and water, add onions and potato. Add a bit more water if
  needed to form thick pancake batter. Fry till golden brown with some
  darker spots in non-stick pan with a 1/2 second spray of Pam. Serve
  with applesauce. Makes 4 large pancakes.
  
  From the Healthy Heart Handbook.
  
  I've had very good results with the plastic bags of frozen Simply
  Potato, a shredded potato that is the only one I could find without
  added oil. More costly than shredding your own potato, it saves time
  and also makes excellent hash browns (add onions, fry in non-stick
  pan, no oil).
  
  Putting a little rolled oats into a blender or coffee mill makes oat
  flour in a jiffy. No need to go out and buy and store oat flour.

  Mary. If you printed out my mother-in-law's directions for preparing
  the basic grated potato you are half way there to Bulviniai Cepelinai
  Kukuliai, or as we say Klatskas. This recipe comes from the
  Nationality Rooms Cookbook, U of Pittsburgh. The potato mixture :
  Grate potatoes into cheese cloth (the cotton flour bag works better)
  and squeeze until almost dry, reserve liquid. starch will settle out.
  Add egg, flour and some of the starch to potatoes and mix well. Form
  into 8 round balls and set aside. Mix meat with onion and egg and
  form into 8 balls. Flatten the potato balls and place meat in center
  and form the dough around the meat into the shape of zeppelins. Boil
  in a large kettle of 4-6qts salted water for 30 minutes. Caution: For
  40 years, mine fell apart, because I couldn't use flour My husband
  said his mother never used it. So don't be surprised if they don't
  hold together! I also prefer to cook my meat mixture first! Sauce:
  Chop bacon and fry, drain and saute onions. Add sour cream, heat and
  serve over the zeppelins. I have not used the starch, I have heard of
  farina or cream of wheat substituted for flour. A tremendous relief
  to be able to serve these after years of failure. Hope your husband
  will be surprised. He should like the Kuglis too, on the original
  bulletin. That is much easier.

    125 ml Vegetable stock
      3 cl Garlic, chopped
      1    1 inch piece of ginger root,

      2 tb Hot curry powder
     25 g  Creamed coconut, chopped
      2 tb Spicy chutney (eg mango)
      1 tb Sugar (omit if chutney is
           -- very sweet)
    350 g  Small new potatoes, sliced
    125 ml Water
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  NOTE: The yield given is for serving as part of an Indian meal with
  other dishes. If serving just with rice or bread will serve less
  people.
  
  CONVERSION: 25g = 1 oz
  :           350g = 12 oz
  :           125 ml = 1/4 pint (UK) = 5 fl oz = 1/2 cup
  
  ABBREVIATIONS: cl = clove
                 tb = tablespoon Mix the curry powder with just enough
  water to form a stiff paste. Set aside while you do the onions...
  
  Put the onion in a large pan (NOT non-stick!) with about 1/2 inch of
  stock. Cover, bring to the boil and boil, covered, for 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally and adding a little more stock if needed.
  
  Remove the lid and boil off the liquid, stirring constantly. Let the
  bottom of the pan go quite brown then pour in a splash of stock or
  water and stir and scrape up the brown residue. Boil off the liquid
  again and repeat, about 3 or 4 times in all until the onions are
  browned and toasty-smelling. Don't EVER let it go BLACK though!
  
  Now you have browned your onions nicely, add the garlic, ginger and a
  little more liquid if necessary; and stir and cook for 30 seconds.
  Stir in the curry powder mixture, and more liquid if necessary; cook,
  stirring, for 5 minutes to get the rawness out of the spices. Don't
  let it get too dry.
  
  Add everything else; bring to the boil, cover and simmer for about 15
  minutes, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are done to your
  liking. Adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper if required.

      Title: POTATO PHOENIX NEST
 Categories: Potatoes, Appetizers, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Medium-sized white new
           -potatoes, shredded
      1 tb Cornstarch
           Oil for frying
 
  A basket of golden potato shreds, called a Phoenix nest, makes a
  handsome presentation for almost any stir fried dish. After you eat
  the contents, you break the next apart with fingers and nibble. You
  can make one large next for a single entree or several small ones for
  individual servings. Because the nests are an open mesh, plan to fill
  them with a stir fried dish that has a light glaze rather than a
  heavy gravy. To make a Phoenix nest you need 2 sieves of the same
  size, one to act as a form and one to hold the shreds in place as
  they cook. To hold the cooking oil, use a deep pan or wok in which
  the sieves will fit comfortably. To determine how much oil to use,
  place an empty sieve in the pan, then pour in enough oil to cover at
  least 3/4 of the sieve. Nests are made of potato, sweet potato or
  taro root.  If made ahead, stack nests, separated by paper towels,
  and seal in a plastic bag. They can be stored at room temperature for
  up to 2 days.
  
  Squeeze potato, by the handful, to eliminate liquid, then place in a
  bowl. Sprinkle cornstarch over potato and toss to distribute
  cornstarch evenly and loosen shreds. Arrange a handful of shreds
  inside one sieve in a latticework over the bottom and at least
  halfway up the side. Fit second sieve inside first.  Heat oil to 325
  degrees on a deep-frying thermometer, place sieve in pan, and cook
  nest until golden brown (about 3 or 4 minutes). Remove from oil and
  lift of top sieve. Loosen edge of nest with tip of a sharp knife,
  then gently remove nest and drain on paper towels. Makes 4 to 5 four
  inch nests.

  mixture to the potato mixture. Using a fork or your hands, blend the
  two mixtures together. do not over work.If the dough is too dry to
  hold together, gradually add a little water. (If your mashed potatoes
  are fairly moist you will not need to add any water.
   However, if they are dry, slowly sprinkle water onto the dough until
  it is moist enough to hold together.)
  
   Roll the dough out onto apiece of wax paper. Sprinkle the counter or
  tabletop with a few drops of water to keep the paper from slipping,
  and sprinkle the dough with flour to keepthe rolling pin from
  sticking.
  
   Pick up the dough by the edges of the paper and place it (paper side
  up) in a pie plate. Carefully peel off the paper. Flute the edges of
  the pie crust, fill and bake according to the recipe of your choice.

      Title: POTATO POBLANO SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Mexican
      Yield: 6 To 8 serv
 
      2    Strips bacon, cut into
           1/2-inch wide pieces
      1 md Onion, chopped
      4    Poblano chiles, roasted,
           Seeded, peeled and diced
      2 t  Salt
      1 t  Fresh black pepper
      3    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 qt Chicken stock
      6 md Yukon Gold potatoes
           .or 8-10 small red new
           .potatoes, unpeeled, chopped
      1 c  Crema, Creme Fraiche or
           .sour cream
    1/2 c  Grated Anejo cheese
           (optional)
 
  In a heavy Dutch oven or stockpot, fry the bacon over moderate heat,
  stirring frequently, until it starts to brown. Toss in the onions,
  half of the diced Poblanos, the salt and pepper and cook until
  slightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Spoon out any excess fat. Stir in
  the garlic and cook briefly just to release the aroma, 1 to 2
  minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, add the potatoes and bring to a
  boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook 20 minutes. Puree in a food
  processor or blender just until smooth, being careful not to
  over-process. Over-working will result in a gummy soup. Return to the
  pot, stir in the Crema, Creme Fraiche or sour cream and bring just to
  a boil. Stir in the remaining Poblanos for garnish. Sprinkle with
  grated Anejo, if desired, and serve hot. Yield: 6-8 servings
