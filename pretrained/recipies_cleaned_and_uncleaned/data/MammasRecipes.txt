   1      Cup           shortening


Mix all the dry ingredients together. Cut in the shortening using a pastry blender, or the old fashion ways with two knives or he he ( I use the bread hooks on my mixer). It should look like coarse meal when finished.

Store in quart jars in the refrigerator or freezer. To each cup of mix add 1/3 cup of milk. Knead, roll out and cut biscuits.

Pre-heat oven to 450* Bakes in 12 to 13 minutes depending on your oven.

To use a quart jar, dump contents into large bowl, add 1- 1/3 cups of milk.

If you store them in the freezer let them warms up some before you use it. Maybe a half hour in the bowl.

Good luck. By the Way. This Recipe has also earned me a first place ribbon with the biscuits I made from it.

     2/3  Cup           all purpose flour -- preferably
                        -- unbleached
   1                    egg
     1/2  Teaspoon      salt

Beat egg slightly with salt and mix in flour to make a rather stiff dough. Knead on floured surface briefly, then let rest, covered, for 1/2 hour. On floured surface, with rolling pin, roll dough until it is very thin. Let dry, uncovered, until it loses all stickiness, but is not dry or brittle. Fold it over several times and cut into narrow strips. Separate strips with your fingers and let noodles dry thoroughly. Store in closed container for future use or use immediately.

TO COOK: 
Drop in boiling salted water or stock and boil gently for 5 minutes. Drain at once. Add a dollop of margarine and stir gently to prevent cooked noodles from sticking together.

VARIATION: 
For a healthier combination, a slightly different flavor, and a more interesting texture, use approximately half white and half whole wheat flour.

   3                    eggs -- unbeaten
   1      Teaspoon      vanilla extract

With a fork, gently stir basic cake mix in its container; measure 4 3/4 cups into a bowl and with a fork stir in water, vanilla extract, and eggs, one at a time. With an electric mixer at medium speed, mix for no more than 2 minutes. Pour into two 8-inch, well-greased, then floured layer pans. Bake in a preheated 350 oven 25 to 30 minutes, until edges begin to pull away from the pan. Cool the cake on a rack for 5 minutes, then remove from pan and cool on a rack; this will keep the crust dry and prevent it from becoming soggy.

If baking cupcakes, fill up to 24 greased and floured muffin cups 2/3 full - or use paper cup liners - and bake in preheated 375 oven 20 to 25 minutes.

   1      9-Inch        baked pie shell
   1 1/4  C             sugar
   6      Tbsp          Cornstarch-Clearjel( Modified Food Starch)
   2      C             water

   2      Tsp           white vinegar
   3      Tbsp          butter


Mix sugar and cornstarch together in the top of a double boiler.  Add the two cups of water.  combine egg yolks with lemon juice and beat until well mixed.  Add to the rest of the sugar mixture.    Cook over boiling water until thick--- about 25 minutes ( I use a heavy cast aluminum pan with a low heat.  I don;t like cooking with double boiler)  I stir  conntinuously with a wire wisk until thickened.  Turn heat off.  Add butter, vinegar, and lemon extract and stir till thoroughly blended and butter is melted.   Pour mixture into 9-inch pie shell and let cool.   Cover with Meringue and brown in oven.

NEVER   FAIL  MERINGUE

4 tsps cornstarch(SURE-JELL-  or Smart and final sells it under modified food starch label)
2 TBS cold water
1/2 cup boiling water
3 egg whites
6 TBS sugar
1 tsp vanilla
pinch of salt
Blend cornstarch and the 2 TBS of cold water in a sauce pan.   Add boiling water and cook stirring until clear and thickened.
Let stand until  COMPLETELY  COLD.

With electric beater at high speed, beat egg whites until foamy.  Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff but not dry.   This is the part that was hardest for me cause you just have to use your own judgement.   If the peaks stand straight up when you lift the beaters it is too much.  You  want the peaks to lift up when you take the beaters out and then gentlyfold over on the tops. Kinda like a soft serve ice cream cone.  Turn mixer to low speed,  add salt and vanilla.   Gradually beat in cold cornstarch mixture.  Turn mixer to high again and beat well.

Spread meringue over cooled pie filling.  Bake at 350* for 12 minutes or until top is browned.

I got this recipe from an internet friend I have never met.
It actually only won 4th place. Four of us had pie that were scored a perfect 100 points. (This is the only one I have had that scored 100) They had to pick again what place everyone got and I ended up with 4th but I am still excited at winning cause of the perfect score.

Beat eggs. Add all other ingredients stir together. Pouor into Graham cracker crust and Bake at 350* for 1 hour.

If the top starts to brown too much cover looseley with foil

Also you can use a regular flour pie crust.

   1      Cup           Diced Ham

Wash the dry beans thoroughly.   Place the beans in a large kettle with 10 cups of water.  Bring to a boil and boil 10 minutes.  Cover pan and simmer till beans are tender.   Check every half hour to make sure there is ample water in pan.    The beans can take 2 to 3 hours to cook in this manner.    If you don;t want to wait for the beans to cook you can use canned beans.  2 cups of dried beans equal about 6 cups of cooked beans.   Somewhere around 48 oz.  

After the beans are done, add the rest of the ingredients.  Make sure it is covered by 1 inch of water.  Bring back to a boil and cook for 30 minutes.

Combine all ingredients and store in container with tight-fitting lid.

CHICKEN: 
Coat with salad oil. Spoon several tablespoons of mix into paper grocery bag. Place 2 pieces of chicken at a time in bag and shake well to coat. Bake on a shallow, well-greased pan (or coat liberally with nonstick cooking spray) in preheated 425 over 20 minutes. Turn and bake 20 minutes more.

Hints and Helps The easier way to coat chicken is to dump all the pieces in a plastic grocery bag; pour in about 1 tablespoon oil. Twist bag top to close, then massage the chicken pieces in the bag until well coated. If you prefer, you can eliminate coating with oil. Instead, dip pieces of chicken in a mixture of 1 beaten egg to 1/2 cup milk; then drop individual pieces of chicken in the paper bag with mix and shake lightly to coat. Let pieces dry completely before placing in the baking pan. Proceed as above.

FISH: 
Brush with oil or melted margarine. Place several tablespoons of mix in a shallow bowl; dip in fish and pat to coat. Bake on shallow, well-greased pan (or coat liberally with nonstick cooking spray) in preheated 375 oven 10 minutes. Turn and bake 10 minutes more.

PORK CHOPS: 
Prepare as with fish, and bake in preheated 425 oven for 20 minutes. Turn and bake 15 minutes more.

   2 1/4  Cups          water
   1      Tsp           salt

Place the beans, rice, salt, and chicken stock, and 2- 1/4 cups water in pan.
Heat until simmering. Cover tighly and simmer 20 minutes until rice is done.
Set aside.

1 Anaheim or Ortega green chili- diced
1  serrano chili diced( or small hot pepper of your choice)
1/2  bell pepper
1  tsp salt
1/2  tsp black pepper
1 small onion diced
1 clove minced garlic
1 lb- ground beef
2 TBS chili powder

Scramble hamburger meat or open jar and drain hamburger meat. Add onions and peppers. Cook until onions and pepeprs are tender. Add the chil powder, black pepper, and salt. Also you might need to add 1.2 cup of water at this point so everything doesnt stick and burn to pan.

Heat till the onions and peppers are cooked. Take off heat. Add the bean and rice mixture. Stir thoroughly.

The mixture should be very thick.

Place about 2 TBS on a regular fllour tortilla and roll. I heat the tortillas slighlty in the microwave before rolling them. They can be eaten like they are or they can be frozen and thawed later for eating. When I freeze then I let them cool then wrap each burrito individually in foil and placed all the burritos in a gallon size freezer bag.
Much better than frozen burritos you buy in the store.
