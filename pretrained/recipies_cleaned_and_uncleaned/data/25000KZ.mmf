      Title: SPICED APPLE PUDDING
 Categories: Desserts, Low-cal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Unsweetened apple juice
    1/3 c  Cornstarch
      1    Egg (or 2 yolks)
    1/3 c  Granulated sugar substitute
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
 
  MY NOTE:  This recipe is marked in the allergy category only because
  it is a pudding without milk, also low in protein. It is one of my
  favorite ways to use up egg yolks or prepare a dessert when I've run
  out of milk. Probably does not require as much sweetening as stated
  in the recipe - start with 2 Tbsp. sweetener and add more if
  necessary. Cost to make the whole recipe is around $1.22.
  
  In a heavy saucepan, combine 1/2 cup apple juice and cornstarch; mix
  well. Add remaining juice.  Place over medium heat and cook,
  stirring, until mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2
  minutes. Remove from heat.
  
  In a bowl, beat egg with a fork.  Add 1/2 cup of hot mixture to
  beaten egg. Stir until smooth.  Return immediately to hot mixture,
  stirring constantly. (The hot mixture will cook the egg.)
  
  Stir in sweetener and cinnamon.  Pour into 4 dessert dishes, cover
  with plastic wrap to prevent skin from forming. Cool to room
  temperature or chill in refrigerator.

  If you prefer to use real sugar, mix 2 TBSP with the apple juice in
  the saucepan.  Divide the cooked pudding into 6 small dishes so that
  there is approx. 1 tsp sugar per serving if you are allowed this much
  on your meal plan.  94 calories, 21 grams carbohydrate estimated.

  The glaze spread between the cake layers derives from the old-time
  penuche candy, a brown sugarfudge. For an even quicker version, omit
  the glaze and spread just the frosting between and over the cake
  layers. 12 servings
  
  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325!F. Butter two
  9-inch diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides. Line pan bottoms
  with parchment or waxed paper. Butter paper. Dust pans with flour;
  tap out excess.
  
  For cake: Insert Steel Knife. Place flour, baking powder, baking soda,
  cinnamon, allspice and salt in work bowl. Process to "sift," about 5
  seconds. Add walnuts and chop medium fine, using on/off turns.
  Transfer contents of work bowl to sheet of waxed paper.
  
  Place apple pieces in work bowl. Process until pureed, stopping to
  scrape down sides of bowl as necessary, about 2 minutes. Add sugar
  and eggs. Process until mixture is thickened, about 1 minute. Add
  butter and process until mixture is well blended, about 1 minute.
  Scrape down sides of bowl. Add rum and lemon juice. Process to blend.
  
  Transfer apple mixture to large bowl. Stir in dry ingredients. Divide
  batter between prepared pans. Bake until tester inserted in center of
  cakes comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on racks
  20 minutes. Turn out onto racks and cool.
  
  For glaze: Cook butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until
  light brown, swirling pan occasionally about 2 minutes. Add brown
  sugar and milk and simmer until blended and mixture thickens,
  stirring frequently about 1 minute. Place powdered sugar and salt in
  clean work bowl and process to remove any lumps. Add hot brown sugar
  mixture and vanilla. Process to mix, about 5 seconds. Add 1
  tablespoon sour cream and process to blend. Add remaining sour cream
  if necessary to form smooth, thin glaze.
  
  Place 1 cake layer on serving platter. Spread with half of glaze. Top
  with second cake layer. Spread with remaining glaze. Let glaze set
  for 20 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare frosting. Place syrup, egg whites, sugar and salt
  in top of double boiler over simmering water. Using electric mixer at
  medium speed, beat frosting until it mounds firmly, about 4 minutes.
  Add marshmallows. Beat at lowest speed until marshmallows are melted
  and frosting is smooth about 4 minutes. Remove from over water. Cool
  to room temperature.
  
  Spread frosting over top and sides of cake. Place walnut halves
  around edge of cake. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Let stand at
  room temperature.)

  Heat oil over medium low heat in heavy Dutch oven. Add onion and

  seasoning if necessary. Bring back to a simmer, then serve garnished
  with crispy shallots. Yield: 4-6 servings CRISPY FRIED SHALLOTS: Heat
  oil to 360 degrees. Separate the shallot slices into rings and place
  in medium bowl. Sprinkle flour over and toss lightly to coat evenly.
  Working with a small handful at a time, sprinkle shallots over oil
  and stir gently . Fry until golden brown, 13 minutes. Remove with
  slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with a pinch of
  salt. Repeat with remaining shallots, salting while still warm. Use

  of these pureed soups are delicious hot and delicious cold. Yields
  are high to allow for leftovers! Soups will be thicker when cold so
  thin if desired with milk, cream, stock or water. These recipes
  showcase our friends the food mill (which purees and separates) and
  immersion blender (purees in the pot, no muss, no fuss, no bother).
  Great tools for purees. Any of these pureed soups lend themselves to
  other garnish: a dollop of crema, creme fraiche or sour cream a

      Title: SPICED CORN ON THE COB
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 lg Tender corn cobs
           -- cut into 4 pieces
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      1 sm Onion; finely chopped
      1    Cm. Fresh root ginger
           -- grated
      1    Garlic clove; crushed
    100 g  Thick set yogurt
           Salt

MMMMM------------------------SPICE PASTE-----------------------------
    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts 5-spice
      1 pn Chilli powder
    1/2 ts Garam masala
      1 ts Ground coriander
      3 tb Water
 
  This wonderful recipe is inspired by an idea given to me by an Indian
  friend. The slices of corn cob are poached in an aromatic, spicy
  sauce with a yogurt base, and are sumptuously delicious. It makes a
  complete meal if served with the simple mushroom curry.
  
  Mix the spices together and stir into a paste with the water. Fry the
  corn cob pieces in the oil until browned all over, and set aside.
  Then fry the onion, ginger and garlic for a few minutes until
  softened, and stir in the spice paste. Cook gently for 2-3 minutes
  and then stir in the yogurt gradually. Season to taste with salt and
  return the corn to the pan. Heat through gently and it is ready to
  serve.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 qt Fresh cranberries
    1/2 c  Water
     12    Whole cloves
     12    Whole allspice
      2    Sticks cinnamon, broken
    1/8 ts Ground mace
      1 c  Brown sugar
 
  Place berries in a covered pot.  Add water. Tie the spices in a little
  cheesecloth bag and add to the pot, along with the mace. Cover and
  simmer until the fruit is soft and broken, about 25min. Remove the
  spice bag and discard.  Run the berries through a food processor or
  press through a colander and return to the pan. Stir in the sugar
  over heat until dissolved.  Cool in refridgerator before serving.
  Serves 6-8 as a condiment.
  
  If you don't mind some texture to your sauce like I do, then I
  recommend only coarsely chopping the cranberries in the processor.
  I've also replaced the whole spices with small portions of their
  ground equivalents.

    1/2 c  Dried currants
 
  I found this excellent recipe for chutney the other day. It uses
  cranberries for those folk that were looking for cranberry recipes
  not too long ago.  I think this is better than Major Gray's
  chutney... but then, whadoo I know?
  
  Combine first 9 ingredients in heavy medium sauce pan over medium-
  high heat.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low
  and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Add sugar, pears, apple, cranberries and currants and stir until sugar
  dissolves.  Cook until fruits are soft and liquid thickens slightly,
  stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Cool to room temperature
  (chutney will thicken more as it cools).  Cover and refrigerate.
  Bring to room temperature before serving.

  inch)
  
  The Story:
  
  The rural origins of Appenzell cookery are evident even in this
  substantial honey cake. It is very fashionable during the festivities
  at the end of the year to serve a spiced honey cake following the
  example of the famous triangular "Biberli", which also blends honey
  and spices. This recipe is inspired by the "Bacheschnitte" which are
  served on the "Funkensonntag", a spring festival held to exorcise all
  the evil spirits of winter by fire.
  
  The recipe:
  
  Gently heat the honey in a copper bowl or a bain-marie.
  
  Heat the milk with the sugar separately then add to the honey and
  stir well over a low heat. Leave to cool.
  
  Put the flour into another bowl and stir in the honey mixture and
  then the other ingredients.
  
  Work all these together to a smooth consistency .
  
  Place a greased flan ring (22 ... 24 cm diameter, 3.5 cm high) on a
  baking tray and fill with the mixture.
  
  Brush the top with milk and score a decorative pattern on the surface
  using a fork.
  
  Bake in the oven for 30 minutes at 180 oC (test with a needle).
  
  When cold, decorate with icing.

  strip lightly with the egg-white mixture. Place a tablespoon of
  filling at the bottom of the strip and fold one corner of the strip
  over the filling diagonally across to the opposite edge to form a
  triangle. Continue to fold the triangle onto itself, as you would
  fold a flag. Place on the prepeared baking sheet. Repeat with the
  remaining phyllo, egg-white mixture and filling.
       Brush the triangles lightly with the egg-white mixture and
  sprindle with seeds, if desired. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until
  dar, golden. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving hot. (The
  triangles may be baked up to 2 days in advance, then reheated in a

           Curried Yogurt; (recipe
           -follows)

MMMMM------------------------APPLE CRISPS-----------------------------
      1 tb Confectioner's sugar
           Juice of 2 lemons
      2    Granny Smith apples; peeled
           -and cored

MMMMM-----------------------CURRIED YOGURT----------------------------
      1 tb Curry powder or garam masala
      1    Banana; peeled and finely
           -diced
      2 c  Plain yogurt
 
  In a large, heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add
  the onion and saute until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garam
  masala, bay leaf, and apples, and cook, stirring continuously, for 2
  more minutes. Add the lentils and stock and bring the mixture to a
  boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook for about 25 minutes
  or until the lentils are tender, being careful not to overcook them.
  Remove the pan from the heat, remove the bay leaf, and adjust
  seasoning to taste.
  
  Serve the lentils hot in one large serving bowl. Serve the yogurt and
  apple crisps separately and invite diners to combine all three
  components to their personal taste. Makes 4 appetizer or 2 main
  course servings.
  
  APPLE CRISPS: Preheat the oven to its lowest setting. In a small bowl,
  dissolve the sugar in the lemon juice. Thinly slice the apples
  horizontally into rounds approximately 1/16-inch thick. Lay the apple
  slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush lightly
  with the sugared lemon juice.  Place the baking sheet in the oven and
  allow the apples to dry, about 3 to 4 hours or overnight.  Remove the
  baking sheet from the oven and gently peel the apple slices from the
  paper. (Some discoloration of the apple slices will occur.)  Store in
  an airtight container until ready to use.  They will last for 2 days
  in the refrigerator.
  
  CURRIED YOGURT:  Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add
  the curry powder and toast until you can smell its intense aroma,
  about 30 seconds.  Remove pan from heat. Combine the curry powder
  with the banana and yogurt in a serving bowl, stirring well.
  Refrigerate until ready to use.  Makes 2 cups.

      Title: SPICED PEACH BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Starter
  1 1/2 c  Cold water
  1 1/2 c  White flour
  1 1/2 c  Syrup from commercial or
           -home-canned spiced peaches
      6 oz Box peach flavored gelatin
    1/2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Ginger
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 c  Dried skim milk powder
      3 c  White flour
    1/2 ts Yellow food coloring (if
           -desired)
    1/2 c  Soft butter
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  3 1/2 c  White flour
 
  Empty starter from glass jar into large mixing bowl. Add 1-1/2 cups
  cold water and 1-1/2 cups flour.  Beat thoroughly. Cover tightly and
  set in a warm place overnight.
  
  In the morning stir the starter thoroughly.  Pour off 2 cups and set
  aside. Pour remaining 2 cups into glass jar, cover and return to
  refrigerator. Heat 1-1/2 cups spiced peach syrup. Dissolve 1 large
  box peach gelatin in it and cool to just warm.  Mix 1/2 cup warm
  water, 1 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1 pkg. dry yeast. Set in
  warm place until foaming nicely. Pour the 2 cups of reserved starter
  into mixing bowl. Add the peach syrup and gelatin, 1 cup dried skim
  milk, 3 cups white flour and 1/2 tsp. yellow coloring (the bread will
  have a rather dull cream color without it). Beat thoroughly.  Add the
  dry yeast mixture as soon as ready and beat again. Add 1/2 cup soft
  butter, 1-1/2 tsp. salt and 2-1/2 cups white flour. Stir until the
  dough clears the bowl. Spread the remaining 1 cup flour on pastry
  board.  Turn out dough (it will be very soft) and knead thoroughly
  using a little more flour if necessary to make a smooth, non sticky
  dough. Return to the bowl, brush top of dough with butter, cover and
  set in warm place to rise (this dough is rather slow so give it
  plenty of time). When light, turn out, knead well, divide and shape
  as desired. Place in buttered pans, brush tops with butter, cover and
  set in warm place until light. Bake in oven preheated to 350 degrees
  for about 45 minutes for loaves, 25 minutes for rolls. This recipe
  makes 4 high, well-rounded small loaves.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Coarsely chopped pecans
    1/4 c  Packed light brown sugar
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Ground nutmeg
      1 c  Unsalted butter
      2 ts Plus 2 tsp vanilla extract
      2 c  Sugar
      3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Plus 2 tbsp milk
      3    Egg whites
 
  Grease and flour three 8" round cake pans (1 1/2" deep). Place the
  pecans in a large ungreased roasting pan. Roast nuts @ 425 degrees
  for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Watch, carefully, lower heat,
  if necessary. Meanwhile, in a medium size bowl, combine brown sugar,
  cinnamon and nutmeg. Then, mix in 4 tbsp of butter. Add 2 cups
  roasted pecans to the butter mixture. Coat them thoroughly. Return
  mixture to the pan and roast for 10 minutes more, stirring once or
  twice. Stir in 2 tbsp vanilla extract and roast 5 minutes more.
  Remove from oven and set aside. In a large bowl of an electric mixer,
  cream 3/4 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar on high speed until very
  light and fluffy, about 6 to 8 minutes. In a separate bowl, sift
  together flour and baking powder. In a third bowl, combine milk and
  remaining 2 tsp vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and the milk
  mixture, alternately, to the butter, beating on high speed until well
  blended and scraping the bowl sides between additions. Stir in the
  pecans. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites on high speed until
  frothy, about 30 seconds. Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue
  beating until mixture holds peaks, about 2 minutes. Gently, fold egg
  white mixture into the batter, one third at a time. Spoon batter into
  prepared cake pans and spread batter so that it is slightly lower in
  the center. Bake @ 350 degrees until a toothpick inserted near the
  center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool 1 minute, then
  carefully remove from the pans and place on a wire rack. Cool
  thoroughly. Glaze. Spread generously with frosting between layers and
  on top and sides.

  1 1/2 c  Margarine, softened
  2 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
  4 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
  2 1/2 c  Pecans; coarsely chopped
 
  Use margarine rather than butter in this frosting because butter
  tends to melt out of the frosting as the cake sits awhile. Roast
  pecans until dark, then cool. Combine the granulated sugar and water
  in a 1 quart saucepan. Cook over medium heat to soft thread stage
  (230 degrees on a candy thermometer), about 15 minutes. Do not Stir.
  In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg yolks on high speed
  just slightly, about 5 seconds. Gradually, add the hot sugar water
  mixture. Beat until thoroughly cool, thick, shiny and very pale,
  about 10 minutes. Start at low speed so it won't splash; then go to
  high speed. If crystal sugar builds up around the sides of the bowl,
  don't scrape it into the mixture, it will make the frosting lumpy and
  you will have plenty of frosting without it. Gradually, add the
  margarine and mix on medium speed until completely blended and very
  smooth, about 5 minutes. Blend in the powdered sugar and vanilla
  extract on low speed until smooth, then, add the pecans. Beat on high
  speed until thoroughly mixed and very thick. If frosting is too
  thick, thin with a little cream, milk or water.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 qt Day lily buds, freshly
           -boiled and drained
      3 c  White vinegar
    3/4 c  Light brown sugar, packed
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Whole allspice
      2    Two-inch sticks cinnamon,
           -broken up
     10    To 12 whole cloves
 
  Rinse and drain unopened day lily buds; clip off any stem remnants.
  Put buds in a saucepan; add water barely to cover. Bring quickly to a
  boil, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Drain. (At this point, the buds
  can also be served as a simple vegetable dish after adding salt,
  pepper, spices, etc. Another thing I do with them is to stuff them
  with ricotta cheese and serve them that way.)  Anyway, back to the
  canning recipe!
  
  Pack hot buds into 8 sterile half-pint canning jars.
  
  Combine vinegar, brown sugar, salt, allspice, cinnamon, and cloves in
  a saucepan and bring to a boil; boil 3 minutes.
  
  Pour pickling solution over buds, distributing spices equally. Seal at
  once.
  
  Yield:  8 half-pints.  Let these stand for a few weeks before using,
  to further develop the spicy flavor.
  
  Note:  Don't harvest day lilies within 50 feet of roadways due to
  automobile emissions.

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
      1 tb Butter

      1 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Sour cream
 
  Source: Cooking For Two When Minutes Matter Working time: 20 min.
  Cooking time: 40 min.
  
  1. Trim pork of any excess fat. Combine salt, cinnamon, cloves, and
  flour on a piece of wax paper. Press chops into mixture, coating them
  on both sides.
  
  2. In a 10-inch skillet with a nonstick surface brown chops in 1 1/2
  Tbl. butter over medium heat, about 2 minutes on first side. Turn
  chops and add onion to skillet around pork. Cook 2 minutes.
  
  3. Sprinkle pork with sugar, then lemon juice. Spoon most of the
  onion over the pork. Turn heat to low, add water around chops, cover
  and simmer 40 minutes. Spoon pan juices over pork halfway through
  cooking.
  
  4. Peel peach(es) and slice thickly. Melt butter in a 7-inch skillet
  and coat slices with butter to prevent darkening.
  
  5. When pork is done, heat peach slices about 3 minutes, just until
  hot. Place pork on a small platter and spoon pan juices on top.
  Arrange peach slices in a row over chops and top with a dollop of
  sour cream.
  
  *Peaches are most readily available from June to September. Frozen
  unsweetened peach slices are available through a longer season and
  are a good substitute in this recipe. (Use about 10 peach slices.)
  
  To do ahead: Prepare through Step 5 up to 20 minutes ahead. Cover and
  leave at room temperature. Reheat pork and complete Step 5.
  
  Note: When this dish is cooking it may smell overspiced at first, but
  don't worry, the resulting flavor is subtle and pleasing.

      Title: SPICED POUND CAKE WITH LEMON BASIL-ORANGE SYR
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 2 Loaf cakes
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
    3/4 lb Unsalted butter; room temp
      1 lb Powdered sugar
      6 lg Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 tb Vanilla extract
  2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
      1 tb Nutmeg

MMMMM------------------LEMON BASIL-ORANGE SYRUP-----------------------
      1 c  Orange juice
    1/2 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Lemon basil leaves, fresh;
           -minced
 
  "Dense and moist, this lightly spiced pound cake makes a lovely
  warm-weather dessert; the Lemon Basil-Orange syrup is the perfect
  flavor companion for this buttery cake. This recipe makes two cakes;
  if you can only use one at a time I suggest freezing the second cake,
  wrapped tightly in plastic and then in foil. However, once the cakes
  are drizzled with the syrup they will keep at cool room temperature
  for up to one week."
  
  To make the cake:
  
  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Grease two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans
  and dust lightly with flour.
  
  In a large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until creamy.
  Gradually sift the powdered sugar into the butter, stirring
  occasionally to partially combine. When all the sugar has been added,
  beat until fluffy. Gradually add the eggs, beating well after each
  addition. Add the vanilla, flour, and nutmeg; mix well. Divide the
  batter between the two pans.
  
  Bake on the bottom rack of oven for 45 minutes. Rotate the pans to
  the top rack and bake for 10 minutes longer or until a toothpick
  inserted into the centers of the cakes comes out clean.
  
  Remove from the oven and cool in pans for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, make the Lemon Basil-Orange Syrup:
  
  Place the orange juice, water, sugar, and basil in a deep-sided
  saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 15 minutes,
  stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from boiling over. When
  the mixture is thick and syrupy, remove from the heat and strain.
  Cool to room temperature. If the syrup becomes thicker than pouring
  consistency, thin with about 2 tablespoons of very hot water.
  
  Using a long, thin, wooden skewer, poke each cake all over from the
  top to the bottom. Drizzle half of the syrup over each cake, taking
  care to spread the syrup evenly into the tiny holes. Let cakes stand
  at least 2 hours before serving or cover with foil and keep up to 1
  week in the pan. To serve, remove the room-temperature cakes from
  pans and cut into 1-inch slices. Garnish with sprigs of basil.

      Title: SPICED PUMPKIN BAQUETTES
 Categories: Breads, Vegetables, Ice cream, Cookies
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
 
        1 pk Dry yeast
      1/2 c  Light brown sugar,packed
      1/4 c  Warm water (105 to 115
         -degrees)
        2 c  All-purpose flour
        1 c  Bread flou
        2 tb Instant nonfat dry milk
         -powder
        2 tb Butter, softened
      3/4 c  Solid-pack pumpkin
        1 ts Ground allspice
        1 ts Ground cinnamon
        1 ts Salt
         Oil and cornmeal for pan
        1    Egg white, frothed with fork
  
  This bread can be baked as a conventional loaf in a nine-inch pan or
  free-form on a baking sheet; baking time may be a little longer than
  baguettes. The ultimate test is rapping the loaf whatever the shape-
  on the bottom for telling hollow sound and firm feel (if it's soft,
  just pop it back inti the oven a bit longer).
  
  Stir yeast and 1 tablespoon light brown sugar into warm water in
  bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Combine flours, instant
  milk powder, soft butter, pumpkin, allspice, cinnamon,and salt in
  food processor fitted with dough hook. Turn machine on to mix
  ingredients. Slowly add yeast mixture. Mix patiently until dough
  cleans sides of bowl (it takes a little longer for pumpkin to work
  in). If dough is too sticky, add more flour by tablespoon. If dough
  is dry and crumbly add more water or pumpkin by teaspoon. Once
  desired moist (not sticky) consistency is achieved, mix until dough
  is well kneaded, uniformly supple and soft, about 40 secounds in
  processor, about 6 minutes in mixer. (Or alternately by hand, combine
  bread ingreidents into large bowl. Mix well and make center space.
  Pour yeast mixture into space. With hands, work yeast mixture into
  ingredients, then knead dough on floured board until supple and soft,
  about 10 minutes.) Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out
  air and seal at top. Place dough in bowl. Let rise in warm spot until
  doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Oil double baguette pan and sprinkle
  lightly with cornmeal. Divide dough on floured board. Roll each piece
  into long cylinder to fit pan, pinching bottom and ends tightly Place
  seam side down in prepared pan. oil piece of plastic wrap, drape
  plastic loosely over pan, oiled-side down. Let rise in warm spot
  until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Slash tops of dough diagonally with
  sharp knife. Brush top lightly with egg white. Place in center of
  oven and bake at 375 degrees F. until loaf is dark brown and sounds
  hollow when wrapped on bottom, about 30 minutes. Immediately remove
  loaves from pan to cool on wire rack. (Freeze up to 3 months). Makes
  2 baguettes, about 8 servings.

      Title: SPICED QUINCE COMPOTE
 Categories: Fruits/nuts, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 qt Water
      2 lb Ripe (bright yellow) quinces
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2    Vanilla bean
           - split lengthwise
      1    Cinnamon stick (2-inch)
      4    Cloves
    1/8 ts Cardamom seeds
      2    Wide strips orange peel
 
  PUT THE WATER IN A SAUCEPAN to heat. Rinse the quinces, then using a
  sharp paring knife, quarter the fruits. Carefully cut out the cores.
  Hold each piece firmly as you work so that it doesn't snap in 2.
  Slice each quarter into pieces about 1/2-inch thick, then cut away
  the peels. As you work, put the cores and peels in the pan of
  water--they will impart both flavor and body to the water, due to the
  natural pectin in the fruit. Allow the skins and cores to simmer
  slowly, covered, for about 20 minutes, then strain, keeping the
  liquid. Don't worry about the peeled fruit discoloring--it will turn
  pink when cooked. Combine the sugar, spices, orange peel and the
  strained liquid in a non-corroding pan. Bring to a boil, stir to
  dissolve the sugar and add the quinces. Cut out a disk of parchment
  paper and place it directly on the surface to prevent any exposed
  slices from drying out. Simmer slowly until the quinces have turned
  pink and are slightly translucent but still firm to the touch, 2-to-2
  1/2 hours. When done, transfer them to a bowl with the syrup and
  chill well before serving. Once poached in syrup, quinces will last
  for weeks in the refrigerator. Makes 1 Quart

  1 1/4 c  Sugar, approximately
           Half a vanilla bean, split

      3 md Pears, such as Bartlett
      4 c  Dry red wine

MMMMM-----------------------BOUQUET GARNI----------------------------
     12    Fresh mint leaves OR
      2 ts High-quality peppermint
           -tea leaves
      1    Cinnamon stick
      1 ts Whole black peppercorns
    1/2 ts Cardamon seeds

MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
      1 tb Plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch
    1/2 c  Creme fraiche
    1/4 c  Heavy cream (approximately)
           Fresh mint leaves, garnish
 
  1.  Using a large sharp knife, trim off the top and bottom of the
  pineapple and slice off the skin.  Using the tip of a vegetable
  peeler, remove the eyes. Quarter the pineapple lengthwise and core
  it. Slice each quarter crosswise 1/2" thick, then cut enough slices
  into bite-sized pieces to make 1 cup.  Reserve balance of the
  pineapple for another use. 2. In a large saucepan of simmering water,
  scald the oranges for 5 seconds. Refresh under cold running water;
  pat dry. Pick out the orange with the nicest skin. Using a sharp
  knife, cut it crosswise into very thin slices; save any juices.
  Using a vegetable peeler, strip the zest from 3 of the remaining
  oranges; cut it into very thin strips; set aside. 3. Juice the 3
  zested oranges. Add enough water to make 1 1/4 cups and pour into a
  medium nonreactive saucepan.  Stir in the 1 1/4 cups suage and the
  orange slices and their juices.  Scrape the seeds out of the vanilla
  bean with the tip of a knife and set aside. Add the bean and star
  anise pod to the saucepan and bring to a simmer over high heat,
  stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cover, reduce the heat to low and
  simmer very gently until the white of the orange slices begins to
  turn translucent and the syrup takes on a rich amber color, about 1
  hour.  Add a few tablespoons of water if the syrup thickens too much
  before the slices are translucent. Strain the syrup and add enough
  water to make 3/4 cup.  Reserve the orange slices; discard the star
  anise and the vanilla bean. 4. While the orange slices are cooking,
  using a small sharp knife, peel the remaining 4 oranges, removing all
  the bitter white pith.  Working over a nonreactive bowl, cut in
  between the membranes to release the orange sections. Squeeze the
  membranes to extract all the juice.  Add the cut pineapple and orange
  liqueur. Set aside to macerate until ready to assemble the soup. 5.
  Peel, halve and core the pears. Slice them crosswise 1/3-inch thick.
  6. In another medium nonreactive saucepan, boil the red wine over
  high heat until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, about 12 minutes.  Stir in the
  reserved orange syrup and orange zest and the bouquet garni (tie all
  ingredients in the listing for the bouquet garnet in cheesecloth
  before using). Bring to a simmer over moderately low heat. Add the
  pears and poach until wine-colored and tender when pierced with a
  knife, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfers the pears
  to a plate to cool. 7. If desired, add another teaspoon or so of
  sugar to the wine mixture. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons
  of water and whisk into wine. Return to a boil over high heat; boil
  for 1 minute to thicken. Pour the soup into another nonreactive
  container; let cool slightly; then cool completely in refrigerator.
  Squeeze the bouquet garni gently; discard. 8.  In a food processor,
  puree the reserved candied orange slices and vanilla bean seeds.  Add
  the creme fraiche and blend. Thin with the heavy cream to a
  semi-liquid consistency. 9. To assemble the soup: Place the poached
  pear slices in chilled shallow bowls or rimmed soup plates. Scatter
  the orange sections and pineapple pieces evenly on top. Ladle 1/4-cup
  of the soup over each serving. Place a dollop of the creme fraiche
  mixture in the center of each bowl and garnish with a mint leaf.
  Makes 6-8 servings. NOTE:  If you buy organic oranges or tangerines,
  you don't need to follow the scalding procedure in Step 2.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 24 Rolls
 
      3 c  Bread Flour
      2 pk Rapid Rise Yeast
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Pumpkin Pie Spice
      1 lg Sweet Potato; baked,peeled
           - and mashed or 1 cup solid
           -packed pumpkin
    1/2 c  Frozen Egg Substitute
           -defrosted
    3/4 c  Hot Skim Milk (120 degrees)
  1 1/2 c  Whole Wheat Flour
           --Glaze--
      1    Egg White;lightly beaten &
           -mixed with 1 tsp water.
           Sesame Seeds; optional
 
  Lightly coat a baking sheet with cookin spray and set aside. In a food
  processor or heavy duty stand mixer, combine 3 c of the bread flour,
  the yeast, salt, sugar, and pumpkin pie spice. Process until well
  combined. Add the mashed sweet potato or pumpkin pack, and the egg
  substitute. Process for 20 seconds. With the machine running, add the
  hot skim milk. Process or knead to make a soft dough that isn't
  sticky, adding more whole wheat flour in 1/4 cup increments as
  necessary. Knead for 1 minute in a food processor, 10-12 minutes in a
  mixer. The dough should be very smooth and elastic and bounce back at
  you  when gently pressed with a finger. Place the dough into a
  plastic bag that has been coated with vegetable spray, seal, and let
  double in volume. Punch down. Pinch off a piece of dough about the
  size of a small egg and shape with the palms of your hands into a
  round. Place on the prepared baking sheet leaving about 1" between
  each roll. Repeat with the remaining dough. Let double again. Preheat
  the oven to 400 degrees. Brush the top of each roll with the egg
  white glaze. Sprinkle the tops of the rolls with the optional sesame
  seeds. Place on the middle rack of the oven. Bake 15 -20 minutes
  until crisp and the bottoms sound hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire
  rack. This bread freezes for about 3 months if tightly wrapped and
  kept airtight. Note: Regular yeast can be substituted if the
  RapidRise is unavailable. Please allow for a longer rising time when
  using the regular yeast. If you buy your yeast in bulk (it is cheaper
  this way) store in the freezer and allow approximately 2 to 2 1/2 tsp
  per a single package measurement.

    1/2    Peeled and chopped onion
      1 tb Oil
    1/2    Crushed garlic clove
    1/2 tb Ground coriander
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
     50 g  Peeled and diced potato
     50 g  Peeled and diced carrots
    210 g  Chick peas
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Filling.
  
  1. Fry the onion in the oil for 5 minutes and add the garlic, spices,
     carrot and potato. Cook for ten minutes, or until the vegetables
     are tender.
  
  2. Add the chick peas and season with the salt and pepper. Leave to
  cool
     down.
  
  3. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/GM6.
  
  Pastry:
  
  1. Sift the flours and salt into a large bowl. Add the margerine and
     rub into the flour with your hands until the mixture is like bread-
     crumbs.
  
  2. Add the cold water and press the mixture together to form a dough.
     Turn out onto a floured board and divide into 2 equal pieces.
  
  3. Take out one piece of the dough and knead lightly, pressing it
  into a
     round shape.
  
  4. Roll it into a circle about 15cm across. Put 1/2 of the vegetable
     mixture on top and fold into a pasty type shape and press the edges
     together.
  
  5. Pierce a couple of holes in the top and bake for 20 minutes or
  until
     crisp.
  
  This recipe is also nice with filo pastry, or the samosa packets you
  can buy. If you use filo pastry remember to brush the outside with
  some melted margerine or butter to prevent sticking.

  Beat in the eggs, 2 T of the oil, salt and pepper. Add the cinnamon,
  nutmeg, cloves, brown sugar, flour and baking powder. Pour the
  remaining 1 T of oil into a 8x11 baking dish. Grease the entire pan
  with the oil. Pour the sweet potato into the prepared pan and bake in
  the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until nicely browned.
  Remove from the oven, slice into serving-size pieces and cover with
  foil when ready to transport. Or serve immediately.

 Categories: Soups, Fish
      Yield: 6 Servings

      2 tb Sugar
    1/4    Fresh ripe pineapple, cored,
           -cut into 1/4-inch slices
           -and then cut crosswise into
           -small chunks
    1/2 c  Fresh or canned bamboo
           -shoots, drained and thinly
           -sliced
      1 ts Salt
      2    Fresh red chili peppers,
           -minced
    1/2 c  Fresh bean sprouts
      1    Scallion, thinly sliced
      2 tb Shredded mint
 
  This soup has become a staple on my table.  It's relatively quick to
  make and absolutely delicious. I've made it with chicken as well as
  shrimp and have some red snapper in the freezer to try out the next
  time. Squid's a natural for this dish.  It's from Southern Vietnam.
  You can make it as sour or spicy as you want by juggling the amounts
  of the ingredients that give those qualities.  It makes a complete
  meal as is and is excellent with salad rolls or cha gio (fried
  "spring" rolls).
  
  Soak the lump tamarind in the boiling water for 15 minutes, or until
  the tamarind is soft.  Force the tamarind through a fine sieve into a
  small bowl.  If tamarind concentrate is used, dilute it with only 1/4
  cup of warm water. Cut each shrimp lengthwise in half. In a bowl,
  combine the shrimp, garlic, 1 teaspoon of the fish sauce and pepper
  to taste. Let stand for 30 minutes. Heat the oil in a 3-quart
  saucepan. Add the shallots and lemon grass and saute briefly, without
  browning. Add the tomato and sugar and cook over moderate heat until
  slightly soft. Add the pineapple and bamboo shoots and cook,
  stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add 5 cups of water and bring to a
  boil over high heat. Stir in the tamarind liquid, salt and the
  remaining 1/4 cup fish sauce. Reduce the heat to moderate and simmer
  the broth for 5 minutes. Stir in the shrimp, chiles and bean sprouts
  and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the scallion and mint. Remove from
  the heat. Remove and discard the lemon grass. Ladle the soup into a
  heated tureen and serve at once. Note: Do not overcook the shrimp or
  they will toughen. Catfish, red snapper or any other firm
  white-fleshed fish can replace the shrimp. From "The Foods of
  Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart, Tabori & Chang. 1989.
  
  NOTE:  I've been pushing Vietnamese cuisine long enough here that the
  ingredients shouldn't be too unfamiliar to regulars. Some of this
  stuff will probably have to come from an Asian market, but you can
  make some substitutions. Tamarind is made from the interior pulp of a
  tree seed pod and is quite sour. It has a subtly sweet taste too.
  I've never done it, but I imagine that you could substitute lemon
  juice for the tamarind and still retain the essential character of
  the soup. Lemon grass can be replaced by grated lemon zest with a bit
  of juice--it's the lemon taste rather than the sourness that's wanted
  here. Dried lemon grass is available and is virtually as good as the
  fresh stuff. It's inexpensive and keeps well on the shelf.  (I grow
  my own lemon grass--it's a really easy and pest free plant to grow.
  If you manage to find some fresh lemon grass, whack off the bottom
  couple of inches and stick it in a flower pot full of good potting
  soil.  Don't water the cutting too heavily until it starts to grow.
  Chances are that it will take off and then you can transplant it into
  the ground--it likes rich, well drained soil and full sun.) There's NO
  substitute for fish sauce.  The soup would probably be good without
  it, but it wouldn't be the same. Since there's not that much
  difference between canned and fresh pineapple (at least here on the
  mainland) I use canned stuff, drained and chopped. If you're ever in
  a market and see fresh Thai pineapple, grab some. The stuff I had in
  Thailand made our Hawaiian pineapples pale in comparison.

      1    Scallion, thinly sliced
      2 tb Shredded mint
 
  This soup has become a staple on my table.  It's relatively quick to
  make and absolutely delicious. I've made it with chicken as well as
  shrimp and have some red snapper in the freezer to try out the next
  time. Squid's a natural for this dish.  It's from Southern Vietnam.
  You can make it as sour or spicy as you want by juggling the amounts
  of the ingredients that give those qualities.  It makes a complete
  meal as is and is excellent with salad rolls or cha gio (fried
  "spring" rolls).
  
  Soak the lump tamarind in the boiling water for 15 minutes, or until
  the tamarind is soft.  Force the tamarind through a fine sieve into a
  small bowl.  If tamarind concentrate is used, dilute it with only 1/4
  cup of warm water. Cut each shrimp lengthwise in half. In a bowl,
  combine the shrimp, garlic, 1 teaspoon of the fish sauce and pepper
  to taste. Let stand for 30 minutes. Heat the oil in a 3-quart
  saucepan. Add the shallots and lemon grass and saute briefly, without
  browning. Add the tomato and sugar and cook over moderate heat until
  slightly soft. Add the pineapple and bamboo shoots and cook,
  stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add 5 cups of water and bring to a
  boil over high heat. Stir in the tamarind liquid, salt and the
  remaining 1/4 cup fish sauce. Reduce the heat to moderate and simmer
  the broth for 5 minutes. Stir in the shrimp, chiles and bean sprouts
  and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the scallion and mint. Remove from
  the heat. Remove and discard the lemon grass. Ladle the soup into a
  heated tureen and serve at once. Note: Do not overcook the shrimp or
  they will toughen. Catfish, red snapper or any other firm
  white-fleshed fish can replace the shrimp. From "The Foods of
  Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart, Tabori & Chang. 1989.
  
  NOTE:  I've been pushing Vietnamese cuisine long enough here that the
  ingredients shouldn't be too unfamiliar to regulars. Some of this
  stuff will probably have to come from an Asian market, but you can
  make some substitutions. Tamarind is made from the interior pulp of a
  tree seed pod and is quite sour. It has a subtly sweet taste too.
  I've never done it, but I imagine that you could substitute lemon
  juice for the tamarind and still retain the essential character of
  the soup. Lemon grass can be replaced by grated lemon zest with a bit
  of juice--it's the lemon taste rather than the sourness that's wanted
  here. Dried lemon grass is available and is virtually as good as the
  fresh stuff. It's inexpensive and keeps well on the shelf.  (I grow
  my own lemon grass--it's a really easy and pest free plant to grow.
  If you manage to find some fresh lemon grass, whack off the bottom
  couple of inches and stick it in a flower pot full of good potting
  soil.  Don't water the cutting too heavily until it starts to grow.
  Chances are that it will take off and then you can transplant it into
  the ground--it likes rich, well drained soil and full sun.) There's NO
  substitute for fish sauce.  The soup would probably be good without
  it, but it wouldn't be the same. Since there's not that much
  difference between canned and fresh pineapple (at least here on the
  mainland) I use canned stuff, drained and chopped. If you're ever in
  a market and see fresh Thai pineapple, grab some. The stuff I had in
  Thailand made our Hawaiian pineapples pale in comparison.

  Grill ribs over medium heat, using either mesquite or charcoal
  briquettes, basting constantly with the marinade for about 1 hour.
  The trick is to have just the right heat: too much and the ribs bum,
  too little and they do not cook.
  
  Slice and serve with lots of beer++for the parents, that is!

      Title: SPICY BAKED SYRUP CAKES
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 40 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Honey
  1 1/2 c  Sugar; granulated
      1 c  -Water
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 lb Walnuts; finely chopped
  1 1/4 c  Butter ; softened
      4 ts Cinnamon; ground (or more)
  1 1/2 c  Oil; vegetable
    1/2 c  Sugar; icing
      2    Oranges' strained juice
      2 tb Cognac or brandy
    1/4 ts Cloves; ground
    1/2 ts Nutmeg; ground
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      6 c  Flour; all purpose (or more
      2 oz Walnuts; finely chopped
 
  (Author's Note): Ancient and traditional small, spicy baked syruped
  cakes, these are perfect for a large buffet. The nickname asserts
  their introduction into Greece by the Phoenicians, but not with these
  ingredients!  Within my lifetime I have seen the oil give way to
  butter and semolina succumb to flour. Combine the honey, granulated
  sugar, water, and lemon juice in a saucepan and boil for 5 minutes.
  Remove from the heat. Combine the 1 pound finely chopped walnuts with
  1/4 cup of the softened butter, 2 teaspoons of the cinnamon, and 5
  tablespoons of the syrup. Reserve the remaining syrup and set the
  filling aside while you prepare the dough. Using an electric mixer,
  cream the remaining butter (1 cup) with the oil until light and
  fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar, beating on medium
  speed.  Add the orange juice slowly to the batter, along with the
  Cognac or brandy, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and the other spices.
  In a small bowl, sift the baking powder, soda, and 2 cups of the
  flour together. Slowly add the flour mixture to the batter and beat
  for a few minutes. Continuing to mix by hand, add only enough
  remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Knead. Break off small pieces
  of the dough and shape with your fingers into oblongs about
  2-1/2-inches long and 1-inch high. Flatten between your palms and
  place 1 teaspoon of the filling mixture in the center.  Work the
  dough around the filling to enclose it completely and press firmly to
  seal. This procedure sounds difficult, but with many hands it is
  quite simple. Place on a cookie sheet and continue until all the
  cakes are shaped.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes,
  then cool on a rack.  Bring the syrup back to a boil. Dip each cake
  into the syrup and arrange on a platter. Sprinkle with the remaining
  chopped walnuts and teaspoon cinnamon, or more if desired. Cool
  before storing.
  
  Note: You may bake and cool melomakarona, store a few days in advance
  and dip in syrup as described above a day or so before serving. The
  flavor improves after a few days.

      Title: SPICY BEANSPROUTS WITH VERMICELLI
 Categories: Pasta, Vegan
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      3    Spring onions; sliced
      2 tb Dark sesame oil
      1 ts Garam masala
      1    Garlic clove; crushed
    100 g  Beansprouts
    150 g  Vermicelli
      1 tb Chopped coriander
 
  So quick to make, this dish has all the qualities of classic Eastern
  cookery. Chopped coriander, sprinkled over it just before serving, is
  the finishing touch.
  
  Soften the spring onions in the oil for a few minutes and then add the
  garam masala and garlic. Stir for another minute or so and then toss
  in the beansprouts and stir-fry for another 3-4 minutes until heated
  through, tender but still crisp. Cook and drain the vermicelli and
  add to the pan, stirring until well mixed and hot. Serve in a warm
  dish, sprinkled with the fresh chopped coriander.

      Title: SPICY BEER BATTER
 Categories: 
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Ground cayenne pepper - or
           More
      1 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Salt
      8 oz Light beer 				
           Vegetable oil
 
  Sift all the dry ingredients together in a large mixing bowl. Just
  before you are ready to fry the food, add the beer and mix well but
  do not beat. Dip the pieces of food to be fried into the batter one
  at a time. Heat enough vegetable oil to cover the food pieces in a
  deep skillet over high heat until a little sample of the batter
  sizzles. Lower the food into the oil a few pieces at a time-too many
  at one time will lower the temperature below the optimum for
  frying-and cook until golden on all sides turning as necessary.
  Remove the food from the fat with a slotted spoon or pancake turner
  and drain on paper toweling. Serve at once. Typos by Brenda Adams

      Title: SPICY BLACKEYED PEAS
 Categories: Vegetables, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Oil
      1 c  Chopped onion
      1 lg Clove garlic, chopped
      1    Tspcumin
      1 ts Dry mustard
    1/2 ts Chili powder (I use more)
      1    16 oz. can blackeyed peas
           (drained)
      1    16 oz. can whole peeled
           Tomatoes (undrained)
        x  Few drops Tabasco
      1 ts White vinegar
        x  Salt, pepper
 
  Saute onion, garlic, and spices in a little oil until the onions are
  soft. Add the (blackeyed) peas and tomatoes. Simmer for 20 minutes or
  so, breaking up the tomatoes. Add Tabasco, vinegar, salt, and pepper.
  Turn off heat and stir.
  
  Serve over rice or with grits.
  
  I use more garlic. I rinse the blackeyed peas thoroughly. I think it
  helps with gas. I chop the tomatoes before adding rather than
  breaking up during cooking. I don't put on salt and pepper. I think I
  use less adding it at the table. I sometimes add Louisiana hot sauce
  at the table. It goes well with couscous also. He doesn't say, but
  this probably servers four.
  
  For me, adding a lettuce salad, bread, and a glass of wine or beer
  makes it a complete meal.  Delicious.

  Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add noodles and cook 8
  minutes, or until barely tender.  Trim and dice green onions. Mince
  ginger and garlic. Gut stems off broccoli and cut head into small
  florets. Peel stems and cut them into strips about one-fourth inch by
  3 inches.
  
  Heat wok or wide skillet over high heat and add sausage. Cook,
  breaking the sausage up and stirring until sausage is browned. Pour
  off all but about 1 tablespoon fat.  Add half the green onions, all
  the ginger and garlic. Cook 1 minute.  Add soy sauce, broccoli

  drained cooked noodles and toss to combine. Serve hot sprinkled with
  remaining green onions. Serves 3 to 4.

      Title: SPICY BUTTER WITH FOUR PEPPERCORNS
 Categories: Spreads, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter; softened
      1 ts Pink peppercorns
      1 ts Green peppercorns
      1 ts White peppercorns
      1 ts Black peppercorns
      1    Garlic clove
      2    To 3 tb. fresh parsley
           -- minced
 
  Soften butter in a small mixing bowl.  Grind peppercorns in a mortar
  and pestle to a medium coarseness; they should not be finely ground,
  but they shouldn't be too coarse either.  Add them to the butter.
  
  Mince the garlic or squeeze it through a garlic press and add to the
  butter along with the parsley.  Blend all of the ingredients with a
  fork. Place the butter in a crock or small ramekin, cover with waxed
  paper or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour before
  using.
  
  Yield: Generous 1/2 cup.
  
  Belsinger and Dille write: "The range of pepper flavors means that
  just a little of this butter adds a lot of taste. It is simple and
  easy to prepare, and goes with practically any dish, vegetable or
  meat, cooked in almost any style, whether steamed, boiled, sauteed,
  baked, or grilled. We like it especially with fish, poultry,
  potatoes, cauliflower, carrots, beets, squash, and corn. Wrapped
  tightly, it will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week, in the
  freezer for a month. If you prefer not to use pink peppercorns, make
  a spicy butter with three peppercorns; replacing the teaspoon of pink
  peppercorns with equal amounts of green, white and black."

    1/8 ts Pepper, cayenne
 
  peel briefly in boiling water, if desired. Finely chop peel, if
  desired; set aside. Juice orange; set aside. In a small skillet,
  simmer green onion 5 minutes over low heat in wine, vinegar and
  stock. Strain well, discarding green onion; cool slightly. Place egg
  yolks and wine mixture in a small enamel-lined saucepan. Place over
  hot water or use a double-boiler. Water should be barely simmering at
  any time. If mixture is over heated it will curdle and must be remade
  from new ingredients. Add butter, one piece at a time, mixing well
  and making sure each piece is fully incorporated before adding the
  next. If desired use a whisk to beat butter into yolk mixture. When
  all butter has been added, sauce should be fairly thick and creamy.
  Add lemon juice, salt, white pepper, balnched orange peel and juice.
  Fold in whipped cream before serving. Serve immediately to prevent
  sauce from seperating. This sauce is delicious with delicate fish or
  vegetable dishes, such as asparagus. It is also very good with
  broiled meat. Makes 4 servings.

  I saw this in Parade Magazine the other day. Don't have time to make
  this. Probably time consuming but enjoyable to make if you have the
  time or the weather (who wants to be indoors cooking in the Summer?)
  Don't make this for the creep who puts ketchup on everything.
  Wouldn't it be annoying after spending so much time cooking someone
  throws some unwanted condiment onto the food? Enjoy!!

      1 cl Garlic, pressed
  1 1/2 ts Cayenne
  1 1/2 ts Ground cumin
  1 1/2 ts Chili powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
           Margarine
      1 c  Boiling water
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
           Salt for the tops
           Paprika for the tops
 
  "The measurements below yield a flavorful, spicy fire cracker. For a
  milder or an extra hot cracker, adjust the amount of cayenne, cumin,
  and chili powder to taste. These are delightful with a salsa dip.
  375~F. 10 to 12 minutes Preheat the oven to 375~F.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, mix the cornmeal, garlic,
  cayenne, cumin, chili powder, and salt. Add the butter and boiling
  water and blend well.
  
  Allow the mixture to cool and rest for 10 minutes. It will thicken
  slightly.
  
  Slowly blend in the flour, using just enough to form a dough that
  will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 3 equal
  portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll as
  thin as possible, to about 1/16 inch thick. Sprinkle lightly and
  evenly with salt and paprika roll over the top of the dough lightly
  with the rolling pin.
  
  Cut the dough into 2-inch triangles or squares. Arrange them on an
  ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on a rack.
  
  These crackers will crispen as they cool. If they are not crisp enough
  after cooling, put them back in the oven for a few minutes longer and
  allow them to cool again. Yield: About 150.

      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Corn kernels, fresh or

      2    Chipotle chili peppers,
           Diced
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      4    Scallions, diced
      1 c  Lowfat soy milk
 
  These delicious pancakes make a terrific dinner when served with a
  bottled salsa for topping. I use chipotle chili peppers that are
  canned in adobo sauce, but you can also use dried chipotles. Let the
  dried peppers soak in warm water for several minutes before you dice
  them.
  
  Mix whole wheat flour with salt and baking powder. In a separate
  bowl, mix corn, chipotles, garlic, scallions, and soy milk. Gently
  blend wet ingredients with dry until well mixed. Spray skillet with
  vegetable cooking spray and preheat until it is moderately hot. For
  each pancake, use about 1/4 cup batter. Cook 3 minutes on each side
  or until golden brown.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Flour
      1 c  Whipping cream, light
      2 tb Marinara sauce
     12 oz Shrimp, cooked
    1/2 c  Vegetable broth
      1 pn Red pepper flakes
    1/4 ts Tabasco sauce -- red
           Pepper
      2    Scallions -- diced
           Fresh basil
           Salt -- optional
    3/4 lb Linguine -- cooked and
           Drained
 
  Ingredient Substitutes -- Cream - 1% milk with 1/4 cup Carnation NFDM
  powder; or evaporated skim Marinara - tomato sauce; chili sauce
  (Heinz); bottled pasta sauce (meatless) Linguine - long pastas like
  spaghetti, vermicelli, fettucini. Vegetable broth - fish stock; no
  fat and low-salt chicken broth; water.
  
  Prepare pasta.  Shrimp will take 6 to 8 minutes. Make a white sauce --
  moderate heat in skillet,  warm olive oil, stir in flour; cook (no
  browning), about 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in the cream. Reduce
  heat. Return pan to burner and simmer until thick (about 2 minutes).
  Sauce needs to come just to a boil to thicken. Stir in the marinara
  sauce. Keep warm.
  
  In separate pan, heat broth, add seasonings and green onions. Add and
  cook shrimp until pink.  Add broth from shrimp to the sauce. Taste.
  Adjust tabasco. Add salt. Gently transfer shrimp to sauce. Serve over
  linguine.
  
  This is good with the smaller shrimp.
  
  Variations-- Add diced sweet bell peppers (fresh) to sauce. Add diced
  tomato pulp (no juice, no seeds). Use milk for the sauce and add 1/2
  cup ricotta cheese. Add carrots and peas (primavera). Add 1
  tablespoon minced, young leaves from society garlic or chives.
  
  Mix the shellfish -- crab, lobster, shrimp.  Okay with imitation
  varieties of crab and scallops. Okay with chicken, but use milk and a
  touch of sour cream instead of whipping cream.

      Title: SPICY DUMPLINGS WITH SESAME SAUCE & HOT OIL
 Categories: Chinese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      2 c  Flour, all purpose
      1 pn Salt
    1/2 c  Water or more

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 tb Water, cold
      1 tb Ginger, fresh, finely
           -- chopped
      1 tb Scallion, finely, chopped
    1/2 lb Pork, butt, ground
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 pn Pepper, white, ground

MMMMM---------------------SPICY SESAME SAUCE--------------------------
    1/3 c  Tahini, (sesame seed
           -- paste) + 1 tablespoon
    1/3 c  Vinegar, Chinese, rice
    1/3 c  Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Oil, sesame
      1 tb Garlic, finely chopped
      1 tb Oil, chili, hot
    1/2 ts Peppercorns, Szechwan,
           -- ground
           Oil, hot chili
           Scallions, sliced
 
  For Dough: ==========
  
       In a mixer or processor, combine the flour and the salt.
  Gradually add water to the dry ingredients and knead to form a firm
  but moist dough. Wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or more.
  
  For Filling: ============
  
       Combine water with the ginger and scallion.  Let stand, covered,
  2 hours or longer.  Strain, reserving liquid. Stir liquid into the
  ground pork with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
  
  For Spicy Sesame Sauce: =======================
  
       Use a processor or blender to combine sauce ingredients. Set
  aside.
  
  To Assemble: ============
  
       Divide your dough into 4 pieces.  Roll each piece into a cylinder
  about 1 inch in diameter.  Pinch or cut 6 or 7 walnut-size pieces
  from each cylinder. Dust pieces with flour and stand each on a cut
  side. Use a rolling pin to flatten into 2 1/2 to 3-inch circles,
  turning them with your fingers as you roll and making them slightly
  thicker in center than at the edges.
  
       Place rounded teaspoons of meat filing in center of each circle.
  Fold edges up over filling, pressing dough together in center, then
  on two sides.  Pinch firmly. Place on floured sheet of waxed paper.
  (If you find that your dumplings aren't sticking together at the
  edges, you can use a little bit of water to wet the edges before you
  pinch them together.... it will act like glue.)
  
       Cook ( a few at a time) in a large pot of boiling water until
  meat is firm, 4 to 5 minutes.  As the dumplings cook, they have a
  tendendy to float ~ this is normal. Cook for a full four minutes at a
  minimum, or the meat may not get done.  Drain the dumplings and
  transfer to serving bowls. Drizzle with spicy sesame sauce and a few
  drops of chili oil. Sprinkle with scallions and serve.

 Categories: Oriental, Vegetables, Vegetarian, Sauces
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    1/2-inch-round ball tamarind
    1/4 c  -Boiling water
      1 lb Thin, long eggplant
      3 tb Light vegetable oil
  1 1/2 ts Minced garlic
      2 ts Ground coriander
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/2 c  Packed flaked coconut
           -- fresh or canned,
           -- unsweetened
      1 ts Cayenne pepper (or more)
    1/2 ts Coarse salt; or to taste
      2 tb Unsulphured molasses
           -OR- Brown sugar
    1/2 ts Black mustard seeds

MMMMM-------------------GINGER-TAMARIND SAUCE------------------------
           -Tamarind residue from above
    1/2 c  -Boiling water
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
      1 tb Shredded fresh ginger
 
  Put the tamarind in a nonmetallic bowl.  Add 1/4 cup boiling water
  and let it soak for 30 minutes.  Mash the pulp and extract as much
  juice from it as possible.  Pour all liquid into a bowl, and save the
  fibrous residue for making the sauce.
  
  Slit the eggplants lengthwise to within 3/4 inch of the stem end so
  that each eggplant remains in one piece.
  
  Measure out the spices and place them right next to the stove in
  separate piles.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan
  or skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute.  Add the garlic and
  fry for 30 seconds. Add the coriander, cinnamon, and cloves; fry for
  15 more seconds. Stir in the coconut and cayenne pepper; continue
  frying, stirring, until lightly toasted (about 2 minutes).  Turn off
  the heat and stir in the salt, tamarind liquid, and molasses, and mix
  well.
  
  Stuff the eggplants with the spicy coconut mixture. Secure them by
  wrapping thread around them.
  
  Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same pan over medium-high
  heat. When it is hot, add mustard seeds. Keep a pot lid handy, as the
  seeds may spatter and fly all over. When the seeds stop spattering,
  add the eggplants in one layer.  Fry the eggplants, turning them
  often, for 3 or 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium or medium low and
  cook them, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes or until they are soft and
  cooked through. Turn off heat. Transfer them to a serving platter,
  pour Ginger-Tamarind sauce over them, and serve immediately.
  
  GINGER-TAMARIND SAUCE: Put tamarind residue in a nonmetallic bowl,
  add 1/2 cup boiling water, and let soak for 30 minutes. Mash the
  residue and extract as much tamarind essence as possible, squeezing
  it hard, into a bowl.  Discard the fibrous residue.
  
  Put tamarind water in a nonmetallic pan along with cornstarch, mix
  well and bring to a boil.  Cook for 2 minutes. Turn off heat and stir
  in ginger shreds.
  
  Note: For a hotter flavor, stir 4 chopped hot green chilies into
  sauce.

      Title: SPICY EGGS
 Categories: Eggs, Brunch, Main dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
     25 g  Butter
           -OR sunflower margarine
      2    Spring onions
           -- finely sliced
      1 ts Garam masala
      2    Tomatoes; skinned
           - and very finely chopped
      1 ts Turmeric (more if desired)
      3    Eggs; beaten
           Salt and pepper
           Coriander leaves to garnish
 
  This is a kind of scrambled eggs 'Indian Style': a stir-fry of spring
  onions and tomatoes is flavoured with garam masala and turmeric, and
  then the eggs are scrambled into the mixture. Lovely with chapatis
  and a mixed salad.
  
  Melt the butter or margarine in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and soften
  the spring onions over a gentle heat for 4-5 minutes. Then add the
  garam masala and the chopped tomatoes and cook for a further 3-4
  minutes. Season with the turmeric, salt and pepper and mix well, then
  pour in the eggs and begin to scramble them, stirring with a fork.
  When the eggs are lightly set but still moist - not dry and
  overcooked - serve at once on warm plates with a mixed salad and
  chapatis, garnished with fresh coriander leaves.
  
  To skin tomatoes:
  
  Put the tomatoes into a bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave to
  stand for 3-4 minutes, then the skin will peel off easily with a
  sharp knife.

 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Uncooked hard wheat berries
      2    Onions chopped
      2 c  Cooked pinto beans
      3 tb (approx) cinnamon
    1/4 c  (approx) chili powder
      1    16 oz. jar picante sauce
      2    14 5 oz. cans chili
           Tomatoes
      1    4 5 oz. can green chilis
      1    7 oz. can jalapeno relish
 
  Cook the wheat berries in 2.5 cups of water (it will take about an
  hour). Combine the remaining ingredients and simmer while the wheat
  berries are cooking.   Add the wheat berries when they are done and
  enjoy!
  
  If the wheat berries do not absorb all the water, drain them before
  adding to the chili.  They should be a little chewy. I didn't measure
  the cinnamon or chili powder; the measurements should be close
  though. The pinto beans were fresh.

      Title: SPICY FRESH COUNTRY SAUSAGE
 Categories: Pork/ham
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Pork butt
    3/4    -1 lb.
      4 ts Kosher salt (or use canning
           Salt)
      2 ts Coarsely ground black
           Pepper
      2 ts Dried sage (ugh, you don't
           Have to use this!)
      1 ts Dried thyme
      2 ts Sugar
      1 tb Red pepper flakes
      1 ts Cayenne
    1/2 c  Water
        md Hog casings (optional)
           Pork back fat
 
  Put the meat and fat through the meat grinder, using the 1/4-inch
  plate, (or use food processor). In a large bowl, mix the ground pork,
  fat, spices, herbs, and water, kneading and squeezing the meat until
  everything is nicely blended. If you are making the sausage for
  patties, simply wrap it in bulk and refrigerate (or freeze) it. Or
  stuff the seasoned meat into medium hog casings and tie into 4-inch
  links. Fresh sausage will keep for 3 days in the refrigerator, frozen
  for up to 2 months.
  
  This recipe gives the basics of sausage making and can be varied. You
  can mix in one or more herbs like marjoram, summer savory, or dried
  rosemary along with a spice like nutmeg, cloves, allspice, or ginger.
  A good rule of thumb is to add 1/2 tsp. of a dried herb and/or a
  pinch of spice to the basic recipe. Two tsp. of minced garlic can
  also be added. Fry up a small patty to test and taste, and mix in
  more flavor as you go.
  
  Southern farm wives used to stuff bulk sausage into small muslin bags
  or 'pokes', or fry patties and layer them in their own fat for
  preservation over the winter. The modern alternative is freezing.

    1/2 lb Raw cashews
      1 c  Oil, preferably peanut
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Chili powder
    1/4 ts Five spice powder
 
  HEAT A WOK OR LARGE DEEP PAN until it is hot, then add the oil. When
  the oil begins to smoke lightly, deep-fry the cashew nuts for 2
  minutes or until they begin to turn lightly brown. While the cashew
  nuts are browning, start another frying pan heating. Remove the nuts
  from the oil with a slotted spoon and add them directly to the frying
  pan. HINT: Take the cashew nuts out of the oil when they are lightly
  browned as they continue cooking even after they are taken out of the
  oil. Save the oil in which the nuts have been cooked, as it can be
  used again. Add the salt, pepper, chili powder and five spice powder
  and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until the cashew nuts are well coated
  with the spice. Allow to cool and serve with drinks.

     45 oz Black beans
     32 oz Light red kidney beans
      1 lg Yellow onion

      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Butter
           Salt and pepper
           Tabasco (just a little)
           Water (add to desired
           Consistency)
 
  Trim excess fat from chops; dice into bite-size chunks. Lightly saute.
  Drain on paper towel; saute onion, garlic, and jalapeno in butter. Add
  pork, onion, garlic, and jalapeno together in pot. Add black beans,
  kidney beans, and stewed tomatoes.  Do not drain beans. Add 7 ounce
  can of diced canned jalapeno.
  
  I usually use a crock pot because the longer the chili simmers, the
  better it is.  When done, the pork should be really tender. The pork
  will also darken due to the black beans. Can serve in bowls as usual
  or over white rice.

      Title: SPICY KEBABS
 Categories: Meats, Bar-b-q
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 lb Pork or lamb
           -(boneless), lean, cut
           -into 1 1/2 inch cubes
    1/4 c  Peanut butter, smooth
      1 ts Coriander, ground
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper (or more,
           -to taste)
      1 ts Cumin, ground
    1/2 ts Pepper
      4    Onions
      1    Garlic clove, minced
  1 1/2 ts Lemon juice
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 tb Soy sauce
 
  Grate the onions.  This is best done using a food processor. Mincing
  is not good enough; you want to end up with something wet and mushy.
  Don't stick your nose into the food processor.
  
  Put all the ingredients into a large bowl, mix well, and cover.
  Refrigerate for several hours, mixing occasionally.
  
  Put meat cubes on skewers, keeping as much of the onion mixture on
  them as you can. Grill over hot coals, turning to brown each side,
  for 20 to 25 minutes or until meat is cooked through. (Lamb should
  still be slightly pink; pork should not.)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spicy pork or lamb kebabs -- I copied this from a newspaper or
  magazine a long time ago; I forget where. It was originally for pork,
  but it's good with lamb, too.
  
  *  You could probably put some vegetables (onions, bell peppers) on
  the skewers between the meat chunks; watch out that the veggies don't
  burn.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, several hours marinating, 30 minutes
  cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      1 tb Unsalted butter -- or
           Margarine
      2 tb Virgin olive oil
      3 lg Leeks -- thinly sliced
    1/4 c  Minced shallots
      1 lb Sweet potatoes -- peeled and
           Diced
      3 c  Vegetable broth
      1 tb Fresh sage -- minced
      2 tb Fresh flat-leaf parsley --
           Chopped
      1 pn Red pepper -- dried or fresh
           Hot
      1 c  Skim milk
    1/2 c  Shredded Monterey Jack
           Cheese
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
           OPTIONAL GARNISH:
           Fresh parsley
           Fresh nasturtium flowers
           Fresh calendula petals
           Pecan pieces
           Shredded carrot
           Bell pepper -- not green
           Shallots
 
  LEEKS: Use both the white and tender green parts. To make sure you
  get all the soil out of the leeks, slice them in half lengthwise,
  then take the leaves out one by one and wash thoroughly. Then
  re-align to make slicing easier.
  
  In a large saucepan, heat the butter and oil over medium heat, then
  add the leeks and shallots and cook, stirring, until soft and
  translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the sweet potatoes, broth (or
  water and/or bouillon), sage, parsley, and hot pepper (1 small fresh
  or dried hot red pepper or use flakes).
  
  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the
  potatoes are tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.
  
  Remove the (whole) hot pepper, if using.
  
  In a food processor or blender, puree the soup in batches. (Or use
  immersion blender.)
  
  Return to the saucepan and stir in the milk. Heat just to a simmer,
  then stir in the cheese until melted, reserve some for garnish.
  Remove from the heat and add salt and pepper, to taste. Serve with
  color garnishes.
  
  Garnish:  mix the white cheese with brown nuts and/or shallots and
  sprinkle in the center. Surround that with green parsley. Or streak
  parsley along one side and yellow/orange vegetation on the other.

      1 ts Curry powder
      1 ts Ground coriander seed
           Thick slices
      3 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 c  Well-washed chopped spinach
           Leaves (about 5 ounces)
      2 tb Unsalted buter, softened
    1/2 c  Freshly grated coconut
           (optional)
 
      In a 5-quart Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
  Sprinkle the beef with the salt and pepper. In batches, add the beef
  and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 8 to 10
  minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the browned beef to a plate
  and set it aside.
      Add the onion and chile pepper to the Dutch oven. Reduce the heat
  to medium and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened,
  about 3 minutes. Add the curry powder and coriander, and stir for 1
  minute. Return the beef to the Dutch oven, and stir in the water.
  Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, until the meat is tender
  and the liquid has almost com- pletely evaporated, about 1 hour. (If
  the stew looks as if it's drying out, add a little more water.)
      Preheat the oven to 350. Lightly butter a 9-inch square baking
  dish.
      In a large bowl, combine the plantains and spinach, and mash
  together with a fork until fairly smooth. Stir in the beef stew.
  Spread the mixture evenly in the prepared baking dish, and dot the
  top with the butter.
      Bake until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle
  with the grated coconut if desired, and serve immediately.

  Prep time 5 minutes. Simmer 15 minutes
  
  Mix dry spices together and sprinkle on chicken. Remove rind pieces
  from orange and lemon with a vegetable peeler and rough chop. Heat a
  saute or skillet large enough to just hold the meat pieces. Spray.
  Sear to lightly brown the chicken pieces, both sides. Meanwhile
  combine the sauce ingredients in a measuring cup. Pour into the hot
  pan and let the liquid boil a bit to cook the thickener. Reduce the
  heat to low, cover tightly and cook gently for 15 minutes. Serve with
  the cooking juices. Add water or more apple juice if the sauce loses
  too much moisture.
  
  Menu * The sauce is spicy, biting and sweet. Taste is similar to some
  versions of Pad Thai -- so serve with noodles or angle hair spaghetti
  or with hot steamed white rice (either long or medium grain). A dark
  green vegetable or medley that includes one would also be a good
  choice. . -- original recipe revised and tested by patH (To Eat-LF

      Title: SPICY PORK TENDERLOIN WITH LEEKS & FENNEL
 Categories: Chinese, Pork
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Pork and marinade:
  1 1/2 lb Pork tenderloin -- trimmed
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Rice wine or sake
      1 tb Garlic -- minced
      2 tb Honey
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
    1/2 ts Vegetable oil
           Vegetables and sauce:
  1 1/2 lb Fennel bulbs -- trimmed &
           Julienned
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Scallions -- chopped
      3 tb Rice wine or sake
      3 tb Chinese black vinegar or
           Worcestershire
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      2 md Leeks, white and light green
           Parts -- julienned
      2 tb Ginger -- minced
  1 1/4 ts Chili paste
 
  Pork:  Combine the pork, soy sauce, rice wine, garlic, honey and
  sesame oil. Turn to coat, cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours
  or up to 8 hours.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Drain the pork, reserving the
  marinade. Heat the oil in a wok or on stick skillet over high heat.
  Sear the meat to dark brown on all sides -- 2 to 3 minutes per side.
  Roast the pork on a rack, basting it with the reserved marinade every
  10 minutes, until the internal temperature registers 150 degrees --
  30 to 35 minutes.
  
  Transfer the meat to a cutting board and let it cool slightly. Cut it
  into thin slices and set it aside.
  
  Vegetables and sauce:  Meanwhile cook the fennel in boiling water
  until it is barely tender -- 3 to 4 minutes. Drain the fennel,
  refresh it under cold water, drain again and set it aside.
  
  Combine the soy sauce, scallions, rice wine, vinegar and sugar. Wipe
  the wok clean and reheat it.  Heat the oil. Stir fry the leeks,
  ginger and chili paste until the leeks are soft -- about 1 1/2
  minutes. Add the reserved fennel and toss.  Add the sauce mixture and
  pork slices. Toss to coat and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  1.  The dish, unlike many Chinese style stir frys, reheats very well.
  By the second day, the flavors will have married to create something
  very special.
  
  2. The original recipe calls for 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili paste. Cut
  this back is you plan to reheat the dish; it heats up considerably
  upon standing.

      Title: SPICY PORK WITH PEANUTS
 Categories: Oriental, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Raw unsalted peanuts
      3 tb Peanut oil
      4    Whole dried chile peppers
      4    Scallions; thinly sliced
      3    Garlic cloves; thinly sliced

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 tb Chile paste with garlic
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Chinese rice wine
           -=OR=- Dry sherry
      1 tb Chinkiany vinegar; -=OR=-
      2 ts -Red wine vinegar
           -(or Cider vinegar)
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Cornstarch; mixed with
      1 tb Chicken broth; (cold)
      8 oz Boneless pork, cubed
 
  STIR-FRY THE PEANUTS over a high flame in 1 tablespoon of the oil
  until they develop a golden-brown color. This brings out their
  flavor. Take care not to let them burn. Remove them and set them
  aside. Lower the flame to medium. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of
  oil and flavor it with the peppers. With the oil still at medium
  heat, add the scallions and garlic. Stir-fry them for 10 to 20
  seconds, until their aroma rises from the wok. Add the sauce
  ingredients. When the sauce comes to a boil, add the cornstarch
  dissolved in broth. The sauce must be thick enough to coat the pork
  pieces. Since the pork is not seasoned, the sauce is the seasoning.
  Add the pork pieces and the peanuts. Quickly toss to coat them well.
  Stir and toss the pork for 30-to-45 seconds, or until the pieces are
  cooked through. Turn the pork out on a serving plate.

      Title: SPICY POTATOES
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Baking potatoes, boiled
           Whole in their peels,
           Cooled, peeled and diced
        x  A squirt of Pam (optional)
      3 tb Water
      1    Medium-size onion, peeled
           And minced
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper (or any
           Ottening agent to taste)
      3 tb Finely minced cilantro
      1 ts Ground coriander
      1 ts Garam masala (use allspice
           If you don't have it)
      1 ts Ground cumin
      2 tb Amchoor or lemon juice
        x  Salt to taste
 
  This was dinner last night.   It's adapted from the recipe for samosa
  filling in Madhur Jaffrey's World of the East Vegetarian Cooking (not
  a vlf cookbook, but many of the recipes are adaptable and the info on
  exotic spices and ingredients is very helpful).  I wrapped this stuff
  in whole wheat tortillas to make a sort of multicultural
  burrito--pita bread might also work well.
  
  Give a large skillet a squirt of Pam, and briefly saute the onions.
  Add the ginger, cayenne, cilantro and water. Cover, lower heat and
  simmer gently. Add more water as the pan dries out and continue to
  simmer until you have what MFK Fisher calls "an odiferous mulch"
  (about five minutes, stirring occasionally). Add the other
  ingredients and turn everything gently with a spatula to mix as it
  continues to cook.  Add more water if stuff is sticking.  After
  another 3-4 minutes it will be ready to eat. This served two with
  leftovers, but there were a few other things for dinner as well.
  
  The original recipe called for a cup of defrosted frozen peas to be
  added with the ginger and cilantro, but I didn't have any. Other
  vegetables might work as well--lightly steamed carrots, for example,.
  or mushrooms.

 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
      1    2 medium onions, chopped
      1    2 hot peppers (to taste)
        x  Salt (to taste)
    1/4 c  Dry sherry
 
  Saute the mushrooms in the sherry in a non-stick pan until the
  mushrooms start to give up some of their liquid. Then add the rest of
  the stuff and saute until soft and brown. Serve over your favourite
  carbohydrates.
  
  My favourite carbo for this dish is Kraft Dinner made without the
  margerine.  Make it as directed on the box, but just skip the
  margerine and it works just fine, and weighs in at under 10% calories
  from fat. Add a slice of FF processed "cheese" to enhance the
  creamy/cheesy taste & texture.

      1 sm Onion, cut into chunks
      3    Garlic cloves
    1/2 bn Fresh cilantro, leaves only
      1 lg Tomato, peeled, cut into

      1    Red bell pepper, cut into

    1/2 ts Coriander seeds
      4 tb Olive oil
           Clam juice, if needed
           Juice of 1 lemon
 
  * such as pequin, coarsely crushed (or 1 or 2 fresh chiles, such as
  jalapeno or Serrano, coarsely chopped, with the seeds, if you like
  your food hot)
  
  This is from Narsai David, a cosmopolitan Lebanese restauranteur, food
  writer and all-around nice guy from the Bay Area.
  
  Clean, peel and devein the shrimp.  Set aside.
  
  To make the sauce, prepare the pumpkin seeds first. If they are
  unroasted, put them in a heavy skillet with out oil or butter and
  toast them for a few minutes until they are crackly but not browned.
  Put them in a food processor or blender and reduce to a fine powder.
  Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, tomato, chiles, bell pepper,
  coriander seeds, and salt and pepper.  Puree until smooth.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a skillet, add the pureed
  pumpkin seed mixture, and cook gently for a few minutes, stirring
  from time to time, until it is well blended. If too thick, stir in a
  little clam juice; if too thin, continue to cook until it is reduced
  to the desired consistency.
  
  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet, add the
  shrimp, and saute over moderate heat until just beginning to turn
  pink. Using a slotted spoon, remove from the pan to a heated platter.
  
  Add the sauce to the pan.  Add the lemon juice and adjust the
  seasoning. Return the shrimp to the pan, turning to coat them with
  the sauce. Serve immediately.
  
  Serves 6.

      Title: SPICY SHORTBREAD BITES
 Categories: Appetizers, Breads
      Yield: 140 Servings
 
      2 tb Paprika
  2 1/2 ts Coarse salt
  1 1/8 ts Cayenne
      7 tb Unsalted butter, softened
      2 tb Sugar
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Curry powder
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
 
  Preheat oven to 350 deg F In a small bowl, whisk together paprika, 2
  ts salt, and 1 ts cayenne and set aside. In a bowl with an electric
  mixer, beat butter with sugar until light and fluffy. In another
  bowl, whisk together remaining 1/2 ts salt, remaining 1/8 ts cayenne,
  flour, curry powder, and cumin. Beat flour mixture into butter
  mixture until just combined. On a lightly floured surface, knead
  dough about 8 times, or until it just comes together. Divide dough
  into 4 equal pieces. On a sheet of wax paper, roll each piece of
  dough into a 3/4-inch thick log. Sprinkle one quarter of spice
  mixture along the length of each log and roll in mixture to coat
  completely. Wrap each log in wax paper. Freeze dough just until firm,
  15 to 20 minutes. Shortbread dough may be made 1 week ahead and
  frozen. Before proceeding with recipe, remove dough from freezer and
  let stand about 15 minutes, or until slightly softened to facilitate
  slicing. Remove logs carefully from wax paper and slice into 1/2-inch
  thick rounds. Place rounds 1/4-inch apart on ungreased baking sheets
  and bake in batches in middle of oven 15 minutes, or until browned
  lightly. Gently loosen shortbread bites with a spatula from baking
  sheet (do not remove from sheet) and cool completely. Carefully
  transfer shortbread bites to a serving dish (they will be fragile)
  and serve as hors d'oeuvre. Makes about 140 shortbread bites.

      Title: SPICY SOMEN WITH STEAK STRIPS~ CHILIES & MI
 Categories: Beef, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 oz Boneless steak, trimmed
      4 ea Green onions
      1 ea Medium onion
      4 ea Garlic cloves
      1 ts Salt
      6 oz Somen
      1 tb Asian sesame oil
      6 tb Vegetable oil, divided use
      2 ea Serrano chilies, halved
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Oyster sauce
      1 ea Juice of 2 limes
    1/2 c  Beef broth
      1 c  Whole fresh mint leaves
 
  Note: Somen is thin white wheat noodles. Cook's notes: Use caution
  when working with fresh chilies. Upon completion of slicing, wash
  work surface and hands thoroughly; do not touch your eyes. Most
  supermarkets stock oyster sauce in their Asian specialty sections.
  Procedure: Cut the steak into 3-inch-by-1/4-inch strips. Cut
  dark-green part of the onions into 3-inch pieces and finely chop the
  remainder. Thinly slice the onion. Mince the garlic. Bring 4 quarts
  water and the salt to boil. Add the noodles and cook uncovered over
  high heat, stirring with chopsticks or a fork, for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes
  or until the noodles are just tender. Refresh under cold water and
  drain. Transfer the noodles to a colander in a large bowl. Toss with
  sesame oil. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wok or large
  skillet over medium- high heat. Add sliced onion and chilies and
  stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until onion is lightly browned.
  Transfer to a bowl and reserve. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the wok and
  increase the heat to high. Stirfry the steak for 1 to 2 minutes, or
  until it just changes color. Transfer the steak to the bowl and

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Onion
      4 c  Snow peas, trimmed
    1/2 lb Vermicelli noodles
      2 ts Vegetable oil
      3    Garlic cloves, minced
      2 ts Gingerroot, minced
      1 lb Large shrimp, peel/devein
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/4 c  Hoisin sauce
      1 tb Soy sauce
      2 ts Rice vinegar
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ds Hot pepper sauce
      2 tb Unsalted roast peanuts,
           -chopped
 
  Serve with: Green Salad with Low-fat Ranch Dressing Crispy Bread
  Sticks Pears with Cheddar cheese Gingersnap cookies
  
  A stir-fry with shrimp, vegetables and noodles that make a great
  one-dish meal. When using a nonstick skillet to stir-fry, you need
  only a tiny amount of oil. For dessert, cheese and pears round out
  the four food groups in this meal. Gingersnap cookies are a good
  choice since they satisfy a sweet craving but are lower in fat than
  most types of cookie.
  
  Sweet and spicy shrimp make an easy, impressive dinner. If you
  prefer, you can use wide noodles.
  
  Cut onion in half lengthwise; slice lengthwise into thin strips. Cut
  snow peas in half diagonally; set aside.
  
  In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles for 7 minutes or
  until tender but firm; drain.
  
  Meanwhile, in nonstick wok or large skillet, heat oil over medium-high
  heat; cook onion, garlic and ginger, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add
  shrimp and snow peas; cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
  
  In bowl, whisk together stock, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar,
  cornstarch and hot pepper sauce; stir into shrimp mixture. Increase
  heat to high; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until shrimp are firm
  and pink and sauce is thickened.
  
  Toss noodles with shrimp mixture. Sprinkle with peanuts.

      Title: SPICY STROGANOFF
 Categories: Digest, Sept., Lacto
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  The first step in this recipe is to make the carrot paste:
  
  (This carrot paste recipe makes enough for use with several meals. The
  mixture freezes well.)
  
        2    large onions or leeks 2 teaspoons of olive oil (optional)
  1 bag of carrots, cut into thin rounds
        4    cloves of garlic, diced stock granules (amount that would
  normally go with 2 cups of water) (I used WeightWatchers ff Chicken
  Broth) 1 packet of Butter Buds optional: ~ white wine pepper to season
  
  Saute onions/leeks in olive oil.  Add other ingredients, and then add
  some water--enough to just cover carrots with the liquid. Simmer
  about 45 minutes to an hour, stirring every 10-15 minutes -- adding
  liquid as nesc. to stop burning.   When carrots are tender, and break
  apart easily, turn off heat and let cool long enough to transfer to a
  food processor.
  
  Process in parts until all is a pureed paste.
  
  Divide into 4 parts.  Save out one of these for use and put the other
  parts in the freezer.
  
  (The original poster mentioned using this carrot paste diluted with
  evaporated skim milk to make a pasta sauce.)
  
  Now that the carrot paste is done, here's the rest of the recipe:
  
        1    medium onion, sliced 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
    1 1/2    tsp. paprika
      1/2    tsp. cayenne
        1    tsp. dill weed
       12    oz. fresh sliced mushrooms ~ veggies
  
  Saute (veggies) with onion and garlic.  Add spices and mushrooms.
  
  Mix together and pour in:
        2    cups non-fat milk
      1/3    cup flour 1 packet of stock granules (or about 2 teaspoons)
  carrot paste
  
  Simmer 5 or 10 minutes until mushrooms and onions are cooked and
  mixture is thickened. Add salt and pepper to your taste. Stir
  frequently.
  
  Serve over noodles of your choice.

      Title: SPICY SWEET-POTATO STICKS
 Categories: Vegetables, Holiday
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 x  Large sweet potatoes
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Water (or as needed)
      3 tb Honey
           Salt
           White pepper
           Ground ginger
           Ground cardamom
           Ground cloves
 
  The potatoes should weigh a total of about 1 1/2 to 2 pounds.
  =======================================================
  ===============
  
  Pare the sweet potatoes and cut into short sticks about 1/4" thick
  (if you have a food processor with a disk designed for french fries,
  use that).
  
  Heat the oil and butter in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat;
  don't let the fat brown.  Add the potato sticks and toss to coat;
  season with salt, white pepper, about 1/4 ts each of ginger,
  cardamom, and a small pinch of cloves.  Add 1/2 cup water, adjust the
  heat to medium-low, and cook, tossing often, but gently, for about 5
  minutes, adding drops of water if needed to prevent sticking.
  
  Add the honey and continue to toss-cook until the sticks are just
  tender and nicely glazed, perhaps 3 minutes. Check the seasonings and
  serve promptly.
  
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  +++++++++++++++ SWEET POTATO STICKS WITH ORANGE AND HONEY:
  
  Omit the ginger, cardamom, and cloves; cook the potatoes with 1 tb of
  freshly grated orange zest (colored rind only, no pith) and, if you
  have it, 2 tb of candied orange peel. I don't recommend this unless
  you have homemade candied peel -- science has not yet detected any
  flavor in the kind sold in supermarkets.

 Categories: Pulses, Grains
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Chuck Roast
      2 tb Wine Vinegar
      3    Cubes Beef Bouillon
      1 ts Chili Powder
      2 lg Onions, Chopped

      2 c  Tortilla Chips
 
  Trim all excess fat from the beef. Cut the meat from the bone in
  chunks. Put the meat and the bone in a large, heavy metal pan with
  water to barely cover. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until the

  cook the juices away. Turn the meat in the rendered fat which remains
  until well browned on all sides (about 30 minutes more). Lift out the
  meat and set aside. Add 1/4 cup of water and the vinegar to the pan.
  Scrape the pan to loosen the browned bits. Remove the seeds and
  membranes from the green bell pepper and chop. Add the bouillon
  cubes, chili powder, onions and green bell pepper. Cook, stirring,
  for 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their liquid. Break up the
  tomatoes using the back of a spoon. Add the kidney beans. Return the
  meat to the pan. Stir to mix. Cover and simmer until the meat is
  tender enough to fall apart easily (about 2 hours). Discard the
  bones. Skim off the fat and add salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle
  shredded cheese and chopped green onion over the top. Serve with
  tortilla chips on the side

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2    Lbs firm tofu, cut into 1
           " slabs*
    1/4 c  Hosin sauce
    1/4 c  Chinese rice wine or sake
  2 1/2 tb Soy sauce
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Catsup
      1 tb Minced garlic (three
           -cloves)
    1/2 tb Minced gingerroot
    1/2 ts Oil
      2    Red bell peppers, seeded
           -and cut into 1 inch
           -squares
     12    Button mushrooms
     12 sm White boiling onions,
           -peeled (bottled onions
           -work fine)
 
  * Note: FIrst press the tofu. To do this, cut the tofu into 1 1/2 "
  slabs and lay each on a paper towel. Top with another paper towel and
  lay a heavy plate on top of each slab. Leave them this way for 15
  min. This firms up the tofu so it doesn/t fall apart on the kabobs.
  When ready to use the tofu, remove the plate and towels and cut the
  tofu up into 1 inch cubes.
  
  In a medium sized bowl, whisk together hosin, wine or sake, soy sauce,
  sugar, catsup, garlic, ginger, and oil until combined. Add tofu and
  toss gently to coat. Let stand covered at room temperature for 1 hour.
  
  Remove the tofu with a slotted spoon. Add peppers, mushrooms, and
  onions to the marinade. Toss to coat. Drain off the remaining
  marinade.
  
  Thread tofu (carefully) and vegetables onto 12 skewers. Place skewers
  on the grill (or on a single layer on a broiler pan if you do them in
  the oven). Brush with marinade and grill10 minutes. Turn skewers over
  and brush with remaining marinade. Griil 10 - 15 minutes longer or
  until vegetables are tender. Serves 4 (3 skewers each.)

  Take your average cake mix.  Bake it up in 2 metal bowls--1 bigger
  than the other.  One unmolded, cut the bigger one (the "body") in
  half, horizontally. CAREFULLY scoop out an adequate cavity in each
  half. FILL with well-whipped set green Jello, and reattach the
  halves. Frost black, arrange on serving platter. Use licorice stix as
  legs. Use 2 BIG green gumdrops and 6 little ones as eyes. When the
  cake is cut into, it spurts green goop, just like a real spider when
  stepped on

  Spider sandwiches: Take bread and put peanut butter on each slice and
  cut into a circle. On top place two raisins for eyes and if you want
  a nose you can use a raisin for that also. Licorice for whiskers
  (black or chocolate) for legs use cheetos for the 8 legs and there
  you go a nice treat before trick or treat.

      Title: SPINACH & CHEESE CURRY
 Categories: Entrees, Indian, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Spinach, fresh
    1/2 lb Ricotta cheese,
           -fresh (see note)
      3 md Brown onions
           Ginger, fresh
           -(1 1/2 inches),
           -chopped fine
      1 md Tomato
  1 1/2 ts Cumin seeds
    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts Red chile powder
           -(cayenne; more to taste)
      2    Cloves
      1 pn Nutmeg
      1 pn Mace
      1 tb Ghee (or use
           -melted butter or oil)
           Salt (to taste)
 
  Cook the spinach and chop it up.  Cut the cheese into about 3/4-inch
  cubes and deep fry a few pieces at a time in oil (a wok is good for
  this).
  
  Fry the chopped onions in the ghee.  When almost brown, add the
  finely-chopped ginger. Use a medium to high heat. When the onions are
  golden, reduce the heat and add the skinned and chopped tomato, then
  the spices and salt. Cover for a few minutes, then add the spinach
  and salt. Cover and simmer about 5 minutes to let spices penetrate.
  Add the cheese pieces, mix and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indian vegetarian spinach and cheese curry -- This is a dish I
  learned from an Indian lady, at a cooking class. It's simple to make
  and has a beautifully subtle flavor. As per true curries, it uses raw
  spices instead of some prepackaged curry powder. Yield: Serves 4 to 6.
  
  *  We eat this dish as a meal with rice, although you can use it as
  one dish along with others.
  
  *  The quantities given for the spinach and cheese are very flexible.
  I never measure or weigh them, just putting in what seems right.
  Experiment. Similarly, it can be kept hot for a while with no loss in
  taste or texture.
  
  *  In North America, most Ricotta cheese is packed as a pot cheese.
  This recipe calls for a more solid form of the cheese. Specialty
  ethnic markets in large cities will carry solid Ricotta. You can make
  your own by buying a tub of pot Ricotta and wrapping it in a clean
  cloth to wick the moisture out, leaving the whole assembly in the
  refrigerator for a week or so, and changing the cloth every day. With
  such treatment the cheese will gradually solidify enough that you can
  slice and fry it. Buffalo-milk Mozzarella is a fair substitute, and
  ordinary Mozzarella is a last-chance substitute.
  
  *  Don't fry the cheese too long.  It should have a golden exterior
  and have a marshmallow texture inside. Frying too long makes it hard
  and dry.
  
  *  Use whole cumin seeds and cloves, not the ground variety.
  
  *  Like most curries, this reheats splendidly.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

    1/3 c  Wheat bran
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
    1/2 tb Salt

    1/3 c  Feta cheese; crumbled
    1/2 c  Water
 
  Defrost spinach overnight in refrigerator or microwave, but do not
  cook. Wrap in dish towel or piece of clean old sheeting and tighten
  fabric around spinach to squeeze out all the liquid.
  
  Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
  order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
  push Start.
  
  The green spinach running through this bread makes it look like
  marble. The loaf is moist yet dense and fragrant with nutmeg and
  cheese. Meat loaf or cold lamb make excellent sandwich fillings, or
  eat slices with chicken, egg-lemon, or beef and barley soup.
  
  In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

  Preheat the oven to 375#161#F. Lightly coat a 1-quart ovenproof
  casserole dish with vegetable oil and set aside.
  
  If using fresh spinach, wash thoroughly in cold water. Remove the
  stems and place the leaves in a large pot. With just the water that
  is clinging to the leaves, cook the spinach over low heat, covered,
  until it becomes wilted, about 3 minutes. Drain well and when cool
  enough to handle, squeeze out as much water as possible, then chop.
  If using frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture. Place in a medium
  bowl.
  
  In the same pot, heat the vermouth and oil over low heat. Add the
  shallots and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the
  flour and blend together well. Cook 1 minute, then add the yogurt.
  Cook, stirring, until thick and bubbly. Season with salt, pepper,
  nutmeg and cayenne. Add the spinach and stir until all the
  ingredients are well combined. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk together the feta cheese and eggs, then blend
  into this the spinach mixture. Spoon into the casserole dish, then
  set this dish in a large pan. Fill the pan with 1/2 inch of boiling
  water and place in the oven. Bake until the pudding is puffed and
  golden brown, about 35 minutes.
  
  Serve the pudding immediately with a sauceboat of hot Mornay Sauce

      Title: SPINACH & HERB RISOTTO (FINE COOKING)
 Categories: Italian, Rice
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           SPINACH AND HERB PESTO
    3/4 c  Spinach leaves; densely
           -packed, stemmed
    1/4 c  Mixed flat leaf parsley,
           -cilantro,
           Tarragon leaves
    1/4 c  Chicken stock, as needed
           FOR THE RISOTTO
      3 c  Chicken or vegetable stock;
           -more if needed
      3 tb Butter
      1 c  Arborio rice
    1/2 c  Onion; diced
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Salt to taste
      2 tb Parmegiano-reggiano cheese;
           -freshly grated
 
  Prepare the spinach and herb pesto - Put the spinach and herbs in a
  food processor or a blender. Process, adding a little stock to loosen
  if needed, until well combined.  The pesto  should resemble a very
  thick soup. Set aside.
  
  Make the risotto - Bring the stock to a boil; reduce to a simmer.  In
  a medium, heavy gauge saucepan over medium high heat, melt 2
  tablespoons of the butter.  Stir in the rice, toasting just until it
  starts to sizzle and pop, about 1 minute.  It should not color.  Add
  the onion, stirring constantly, and cook until translucent, 1-2
  minutes.  Stir in the wine. When almost all the liquid has
  disappeared, after about 1 minute, add just enough hot stock to cover
  the rice.  Lower the heat to maintain a vigorous simmer; stir
  occasionally.  When the stock is almost gone, again add enough stock
  to cover the rice, along with a pinch of salt.  Check the risotto
  every 3 or 4 minutes, giving an occasional stir to make sure it isn't
  sticking to the bottom of the pan, adding just enough stock to cover
  the rice when the liquid has almost disappeared.  Continue this way
  until the rice is just al dente, about 20 minutes total cooking time.
  Bite into a grain; you should see a white pin-dot in the center.
  Take the risotto off the heat.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon
  butter.  Stir in half of the herb pesto (freeze the rest for another
  time) and the cheese.  Stir vigorously for a few seconds.  The
  risotto should be moist and creamy, not runny. Add more stock to
  loosen the risotto if you like, and more salt to taste , if needed.
  Serve immediately.

      Title: SPINACH & PROSCIUTTO EN CROUTE
 Categories: None
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Clove garlic, crushed
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Parmesan cheese
      1 lb Frozen puff pastry, thawed
     10 oz Frozen chopped spinach
           -thawed
    1/2 lb Coarsely grated swiss cheese
    1/4 lb Prosciutto, thinly sliced
      1 c  Ripe black olives, sliced
      1 tb Cold water
 
  A pastry turnover encasing a spinach, cheese, olive, and prosciutto
  filling, baked until golden.
  
  1. Mix together the oil, garlic, black pepper, and Parmesan. Cover and
  marinate for 2 to 3 hours.
  
  2. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured board to form a rectangle
  12x20- inches. (Pinch any seams together so that you essentially have
  one large piece of dough.) Chill for 30 minutes.
  
  3. Squeeze the spinach of all its liquid. Spread the spinach down the
  center of the length of the dough forming a layer 4 inches wide and
  extending to within 1-inch of either end.
  
  4. Cover the spinach with half of the Swiss cheese. Blanket the
  cheese with even layers of prosciutto. Spoon the marinade over the
  ham.
  
  5. Sprinkle the remainder of the Swiss cheese over the prosciutto. Top
  everything with black olives.
  
  6. Fold the dough like a turnover, overlapping the sides. Crimp the
  ends together firmly to seal. Place seam side down on an ungreased
  baking sheet.
   (Up to this point may be prepared 2 to 4 hours in advance and
  refrigerated.
   Return to room temperature to bake.)
  
  7. Beat the egg and water together. Brush the pastry with the egg
  wash. This gives the loaf a golden glaze when baked.
  
  8. Bake in a preheated 350F degrees oven for 30 minutes. Transfer to a
  platter, cut into 1 and 1/2-inch wide slices, and serve immediately.

      Title: SPINACH & RICE GRATIN
 Categories: French/prov, Autumn, Main dishes, Rice, Summer
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Fresh spinach -- thawed
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 md Onion -- chopped
      2    Garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2 c  Cooked rice
      2 oz Gruyere cheese -- grated
      2 tb Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
           Grated
    1/2 c  Parsley -- chopped
           Salt and pepper -- to taste
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
      3    Eggs -- beaten
      2 tb Fine dry breadcrumbs
 
  Heat a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat and add the
  spinach. Cook, stirring, until it wilts in the water left on its
  leaves. It will take about a minute for all the spinach to wilt after
  the water on its leaves reaches a boil. Transfer to a colander and
  press out as much water as possible. When the spinach is cool enough
  to handle, wrap it in a towel and squeeze out more water. Chop fine.
  If you're using defrosted spinach, squeeze out the water.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375#161#F. Brush a 2-quart gratin dish with olive
  oil.
  
  Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed nonstick
  skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and saute, stirring, until
  tender and just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic
  and spinach. Stir together for about 30 seconds, then transfer to a
  large bowl. Stir in the rice, cheeses, parsley, thyme, and beaten
  eggs. Add salt and pepper to taste. Turn the mixture into prepared
  gratin dish and smooth the top with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle on
  the breadcrumbs and drizzle on the remaining olive oil.
  
  Bake for 30 minutes or until the gratin is set and the top golden
  brown. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Cover and refrigerate.
  Cut into squares and serve.
  
  COMMENTS: This is really delicious, but make sure to season well with
  salt and pepper or it can be a little bland. Keeps well for several
  days and makes perfect picnic food.

 Categories: Breads, Cheese/eggs, Vegetarian, Pancakes, Breakfast
      Yield: 18 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE PANCAKES---------------------------
      2 oz Buckwheat flour
      2 oz Plain white flour
      2    Eggs
      2 tb Butter; melted
    1/4 pt Milk
    1/4 pt Water

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
      2 lb Fresh spinich
      1 lg Onion
      3 oz Stilton cheese
      2 oz Walnut pieces
           Butter
      1    Garlic sliver

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE SAUCE----------------------------
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Plain white flour
    1/2 pt Stock
    1/4 pt Double cream
      2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
      1 ts (heaped) Dijon mustard
 
  Make a smooth batter with the flours, eggs, milk and water, then stir
  in the cool melted butter for extra richness and to prevent sticking
  during cooking.  Use a 6-inch pan and make thin pancakes in the usual
  way, but be sure to stir the batter vigorously in between making each
  pancake or all the buckwheat flour will sink to the bottom of the
  mixture. If preparing ahead, cool the pancakes then stack them
  (interleaved with greaseproof paper) and wrap in a foil parcel.
  
  To make the filling, wash and boil or steam the spinach until just
  tender. Chop it and squeeze out all the liquid (save the juices for a
  soup). Chop the onion finely and sweat it in a knob of butter until
  it's deliciously soft.  Stir in the spinach, season with a little
  salt, lots of pepper and the garlic. Toast the walnuts and crumbled
  Stilton into the spinach mixture to give it savoury flavour and bite.
  Stuff the pancakes with the mixture, roll them up neatly and pile
  them into a lightly buttered gratin dish. Cover with foil and heat
  through in the oven for 25-30 minutes at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.
  
  Make a smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock (preferably
  good chicken stock) and cream.  Let it simmer for about 5 minutes,
  stirring once or twice, then season with the cheese, mustard and salt
  and pepper. If the sauce is made ahead, reheat it in a double-boiler
  for serving, then pour it over the dish of pancakes just before
  bringing to table.

      Title: SPINACH CASSEROLE
 Categories: Casseroles
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     10 oz Spinach, chopped
           -(frozen or fresh)
      2 tb Butter (or margarine)
      1 sm Onion, chopped
           Yogurt, plain
           -(between 1-2 C)
      2 tb Flour
           Cheddar or parmesan cheese
           -(between 1-2 C), grated
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Rinse and chop the spinach.  Place the chopped spinach in a heavy
  skillet, cover, and steam until wilted, stirring occasionally. There
  is no need to add water other than what clings to the leaves from
  washing. (If you are using frozen spinach, place over low or medium
  heat to thaw and allow excess water to evaporate.) Transfer to small
  bowl.
  
  In a skillet, melt the butter (or margarine).  Add the onion and cook
  until soft.  Add the flour and stir for 1 minute over medium heat.
  Season the mixture to taste with salt and pepper, and then gradually
  whisk in the yogurt.
  
  Add the spinach and turn to coat the leaves.  Remove from heat and
  blend in the cheese.  Pour into a greased 8x4-inch loaf pan, and bake
  for 20 minutes at
      350    degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spinach casserole with yogurt and cheese -- Here is a recipe for a
  spinach casserole that is delightfully cheesy. It might even make you
  love spinach.
  
  *  Don't skimp on the cheese, and use fresh cheese rather than
  pre-packaged grated cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.

      Title: SPINACH CHEESE CASSEROLE IN PUFF PASTRY
 Categories: Casseroles
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     10 oz Spinach, chopped
           -(fresh or frozen)
      1 c  Cottage OR
           -ricotta cheese
      1 c  Feta cheese
           -(crumbled and drained
           -of any brine)
    1/4 c  Parmesan or romano
           -cheese, grated
    1/4 c  Scallions, chopped
      4 lg Eggs
      2 tb Butter
      1 pn Salt
      1 pn Pepper
     12 oz Puff pastry
           -(frozen pastry thawed
           -to room temperature,
           -or homemade)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cook the spinach in boiling water.
  Drain, rinse with cool water, and squeeze out as much moisture as you
  can.
  
  Melt the butter in a small skillet.  Cook the scallions until slightly
  soft.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine the cheeses and the eggs. Mix well.
  Add the spinach, the butter and scallions, the salt and pepper and
  mix again.
  
  Lightly butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking dish.
  Roll out a sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface to make a
  14-inch square. Roll out a second sheet to make a 9-inch square. Lay
  the bigger pastry sheet in the buttered dish, draping the extra
  pastry over the edges.
  
  Spread the spinach and cheese mixture evenly in the dish. Put the
  remaining pastry sheet on top. Trim excess pastry if necessary and
  seal the edges closed. Use scraps of pastry dough to decorate the top
  of the pie. Brush top with additional melted butter if desired. Bake
  for 45 minutes at 350 degrees F. or until pastry is golden brown. Let
  rest for 10 minutes before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spinach and cheeses in a puff pastry crust -- A recipe of this type
  appeared in _Cuisine Magazine_. The dish is hearty enough to be a main
  course, but can also be a side dish to a meat entree. Yield: Serves 4
  to 6.
  
  *  The casserole may be prepared, covered and refrigerated for up to 8
  hours.
  
  *  As an alternative to puff pastry, you might try using sheets of
  filo dough, overlapped to make the bottom and top crusts. I have also
  baked this dish in a pie pan using filo dough. One way to cut down on
  the calories in this dish is to omit the bottom crust entirely. This
  is a very flexible recipe. Other vegetables can be substituted for
  the spinach, and other ingredients like sauteed garlic and mushrooms
  can be added.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SPINACH COOKED IN A BIHARI STYLE
 Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Indian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Fresh spinach
           - washed and trimmed
    1/2 ts Freshly grated fresh ginger
      1    Garlic clove; mashed
    1/2 ts Minced fresh hot green chili
           -(very finely minced)
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Very finely minced cilantro
      2 tb Mustard oil
 
  This dish, traditionally made with mixed greens such as spinach and
  mustard, resembles an Italian pesto, though it is much thicker in
  consistency.  In place of olive oil, mustard oil is used, and apart
  from the taste of the greens themselves, the other strong flavors
  include raw garlic, raw ginger, green chilis, and cilantro. If you
  can't obtain the pungent golden mustard oil which is called for in
  this recipe (available in Chinese as well as Indian groceries), steep
  1/2 teaspoon powdered dried mustard in 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.
  
  In Northern India, this dish is eaten at room temperature for
  breakfast, along with fried bread and tea. While raw garlic may seem
  alarming first thing in the morning, Indians consider it a medicinal
  necessity, and many swallow a crushed clove every day.
  
  DIRECTIONS: ========== Bring 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a
  large pot.  Add spinach and cook on high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or
  until wilted. Drain, rinse under cold water, and squeeze out as much
  liquid as you can easily.
  
  Put spinach in food processor or blender with 2 tablespoons water and
  blend until smooth.  This will result in a fairly thick paste. Put in
  a serving bowl.
  
  Whisk together ginger, garlic, green chili, salt, cilantro, and oil.
  Pour this dressing over the spinach and mix thoroughly.

 Categories: Pies, Vegetables
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
     16 oz Cream cheese, softened
    3/4 c  Butter, softened
  2 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Onion, finely chopped
      3    Garlic clove; minced
      4 sl Bacon, cooked and crumbled
      1 tb Bacon drippings
     10 oz Spinach, frozen; thawed
           -and drained
      1 c  Cottage cheese
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/8 ts Nutmeg, ground
      1    Egg, beaten
 
  In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter till smooth.
  (Use a stand mixer, since the mixture is heavy.) Gradually add in the
  flour and salt. Lightly knead the dough by hand. Cover with plastic
  wrap and refrigerate for 3 hours.
  
  In a medium skillet, cook the onion and garlic in the bacon drippings
  until the onion is tender but not brown. Mix in the bacon, spinach,
  cottage cheese, pepper, and nutmeg; let the mixture cool.
  
  Preheat the oven to 450 F. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface
  to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut 3-inch circles in the pastry, place 1
  teaspoon of the filling in each circle, just to one side of the
  center. Moisten the edge of the circle with the egg, fold the dough
  in half over the filling to make a semicircular empanada. Seal the
  edges with fork tines, and poke the top of each pastry with a fork to
  make a vent. Put the empanadas on an ungreased cookie sheet, brush
  their tops with egg, and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden.
  
  Makes 60 empanadas.

      1 pk Corn tortillas
      1 pk Nonfat sour cream
      1    Bunch cilantro chopped
           Or chopped chives
 
  1.  Make the stuffing. Put the cottage cheese and cream cheese in food
  processor and blend till smooth. Add the other ingredients and stir
  into cheese mixture. 2. Red sauce: This is my way of doing this. YOu
  can use any red chili sauce recipe here.Wash chilis and remove seeds
  unless you want this REALLY hot.
    Boil water in saucepan. Add chilis and turn off heat and let soak.
  Melt butter in frying pan. Add onions and garlic and saute until
  clear. Set aside. Put chilis and water in food processor and blend
  until smooth. Add flour to butter mix and make a roux. Add chili with
  liquid and make a sauce. You may have to add water or a small can of
  tomato sauce. I don't use the tomato sauce. Simmer until thickened
  stirring constantly. Set aside. 3.  Simmer tomatillos in water until
  tender.Add to food processor and blend until smooth. Saute onion and
  garlic in a bit of oil or butter in frying pan and add to tomatillos
  4. Dip tortillas in the red sauce while it is simmering to soften
  them. Fill with a dollop of the cheese and spinach mixture and roll
  and put in glass casserole sprayed with pan spray, seam side down. 5.
  Cover with red sauce. 6. Add tomatillo sauce 7. Dollops of sour cream
  can be put on top of this. This makes a red green and white casserole
  to compliment the Mexican flag. I like to garnish with chopped fresh
  cilantro. Emilie rwsm05a

 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish, Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12    Curly lasagna noodles made
           -w/o eggs
      2 tb Olive oil
  1 1/4 lb Spinach; well washed, stems
           -removed and leaves coarsely
           -chopped
      1 md Onion; finely chopped
      2    Broccoli stalks; cut into
           -small florets, stalks
           -finely chopped
      1 lb Mushrooms; thinly sliced
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
  5 1/2 c  Tofu "cheese" sauce (see
           -recipe)
      2 c  Tomato sauce
 
  In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, cook the lasagna
  noodles just until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain well. Toss with 1
  tablespoon of the oil to keep the noodles from sticking.
  
  Meanwhile, put 1 inch of water into a large saucepan with a steamer
  basket, cover with the lid, and bring to a gentle boil. Put the
  spinach in the steamer basket, cover and steam until the spinach is
  wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the spinach and rinse under cold
  running water. Use your hands to squeeze the excess water from the
  spinach.
  
  In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over
  medium heat. Add the onion, broccoli, mushrooms, and garlic and cook
  until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach and
  cook, stirring, until all the moisture has evaporated from the
  spinach, about 2 minutes. Stir in the Tofu "cheese" sauce, and remove
  from the heat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil a 9- by 13-inch baking
  dish. Place 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the baking dish, overlapping
  them slightly. Spread with half the spinach filling. Top with 4 more
  noodles, and spread with the remaining filling. Top with 4 more
  noodles, and spread the remaining tomato sauce on top.
  
  Bake until bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before
  serving.

           Pressed
      3 tb Capers plus a bit of caper
           Liquid (more if you love
           Capers)
      1 tb Basil
      1 ts Rosemary, crushed

      1 ea Lemon juice to taste
      3 lg Red peppers, sliced thinly
      1    Box wide spinach noodles (24
           Oz)
 
  Saute garlic, herbs and capers by your favorite saute method. Add
  water and red peppers, and simmer the red peppers until they are
  slightly softened. A bit of crunch is a good thing. There should be a
  fair amount of liquid left when you are done simmering.
  
  Cook some wide spinach noodles (I used 24oz for five of us) until
  they are just a hair underdone and then drain. Toss them with the
  peppers and liquid over a low heat until pasta is coated and liquid
  is absorbed.

      1 pk (10oz) chopped spinach,
           Cooked
 
  Cook and drain the spinach, reserving the liquid i case you need it
  for the dough. This may be difficult to roll out the first time
  through a hand machine. Simply repeat until it rolls smoothly. Don't
  be too quick to add liquid to the dough. If dough becomes too sticky
  in the extruder, add a little more flour to mix if your machine
  allows it, or dust with flour as it comes out to prevent sticking.

      Title: SPINACH PIZZA
 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      2    Or 3 whole Pita Bread
      1    10oz pkg frozen spinach
    1/3 c  Nutritional yeast
      1 md Onion
      5    Or 6 plum tomatoes
      8 oz Pkg fresh mushrooms
      3    To 4 cloves garlic
      1 ts Each of the following
           Spices: basil, parsley,
           Cayenne pepper
    1/2    To 1 cup rice milk
      4 tb Flour
 
  Thaw spinach completely, press out all water.  Heat milk in saucepan,
  when hot but not boiling stir in flour. Stir until sauce begins to
  thicken, turn heat down. Add nutritional yeast and spinach. Stir
  constantly until thick and gooey, only about 3-4 min.
  
  In separate pan, saute onion, garlic, until onion is tender. Stir in
  tomatoes, mushrooms, and spices. Saute until just done. Preheat oven
  to 425.  Using a very sharp bread knife, split each pita bread so
  that you have two round flat pieces instead of one thick one. Place
  each piece of bread on a cookie sheet or pizza pan. Spread spinach
  sauce over each. Top with tomato mixture, being careful to avoid the
  juice. Bake for 5 to 7 min.
  
  Watch closely so that the edges of the pita don't burn. Makes a nice
  crunchy crust.  This made enough for 5 individual pizzas. Sorry, I
  don't have nutritional info.

      Title: SPINACH ROLL
 Categories: Low, Fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     10    Sheets phyllo (oil-free)
      2    Cloves garlic minced
      1 ts Chopped basil (I used the
           Dry kind)
      1 pk Frozen spinach (the boxed
           Kind)
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs
      1 tb Parmesan
           Cooking spray
           Pepper
      5 tb Ricotta (fat-free)
      5 ts Mozzarella (fat-free)
 
  I nuked the spinach 5 minutes on high, and while it was doing, I
  sauted the garlic in a skillet. When the spinach was done, I added
  it, the bread crumbs, the parmesan, the pepper, and the basil. When
  the water was pretty much gone, I cut the phyllo sheets in half, then
  lay down one sheet, sprayed with a little spray, put down another
  sheet, sprayed, until four half sheets were down. Then I took 1/5 of
  the spinach mixture, then put on a tablespoon of the ricotta, and a
  teaspoon of the mozzarella. Then I rolled it, sprayed it once more
  lightly, then started on the next "roll." Then I baked em until they
  were golden at about 350. They came out pretty good too.

MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Dry mustard
      1 tb Onion juice
    1/3 c  Cider vinegar
      1 c  Oil
      1 tb Poppy seeds

MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
      1    Head red lettuce
      2 bn Of spinach
    1/2 lb Bacon
      1    Hard boiled egg
 
  This is the first salad I ever tasted that I actually LIKED rather
  than just endured.  And that was when I was in my early thirties! I
  got it from my cousin and she got it originally from Sunset Magazine
  if I remember correctly.  At any rate it's excellent.  One of the few
  salads that I consider a full meal in itself. The dressing has become
  my house dressing. I usually make a double recipe. Keeps good in the
  fridge.
  
  Mix the dressing ingredients and set aside to blend flavors. Clean the
  spinach and lettuce and tear into pieces. Fry the bacon crisp and
  crumble it into not-too-small pieces. Chop the egg coarsely. Toss it
  all together and add dressing to taste.

  I used to make this when I had to serve a BIG crowd, or take
  something to a potluck. Warning, the dressing, all by itself, tastes
  FAR too garlicky. Somehow it works when all mixed, tho. And the salad
  keeps very well, a good make-ahead...up to 12 hours ahead or so:

  aside. Squeeze the residual juice from the membranes into the bowl
  and reserve. Combine the spinach and watercress in a mixing bowl. Put
  the pine nuts in a small saute' pan and cook over medium heat for
  about 6 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until the nuts are
  golden brown. Transfer the pine nuts to a small bowl. Put the
  shallots, garlic, vinegars and reserved orange juice into the saute'
  pan.  Bring to a bowl over low heat. Stir in the black pepper (to
  taste), then pour the dressing over the spinach and watercress. Toss
  to coat. Arrange mixture on salad plates, spoon orange segments atop
  each and garnish with the pine nuts and, if you like, orange wheels.
  MAKING ORANGE WHEELS Slice an unpeeled orange into 1/4-inch rounds.
  Make a cute halfway across each round, from the peel to the core, and
  twist the sides of the cut in opposite directions so that the top
  half of the round will stand upright when placed on the salad.

 Categories: Mexican, Salads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Spinach -- washed and dried
    1/4 lb Watercress -- washed and
           Dried
      6 lg Anaheim chili peppers -- cut
           Crosswise
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 lb Cactus or 15oz nopalitos --
           Drained
      1 lg Red onion -- thinly sliced
      1 c  Radishes -- sliced
      1 lb Queso asadero -- cubed
      2 lg Avocados
    2/3 c  Cider vinegar
      1    Clove garlic -- pressed
      1 tb Soy sauce
    1/4 ts Pepper
 
  Discard spinach stems and any yellow or wilted leaves; wash spinach
  and pat dry. Wrap in paper towels, enclose in plastic bags, and
  refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 days. Also discard
  tough watercress stems and yellow leaves; wash and crisp watercress
  as for spinach. With scissors, cut chiles crosswise ito thin strips;
  discard seeds amd stems. In a 10- to 12 inch frying pan, stir oil and
  chiles over low heat until chiles are crosp, 2 to 3minutes(watch
  closely to avoid burning). Lift chiles from oil; set aside. Save oil
  for dressing. If whole cactus pad has thorns or prickly hairs, hold
  pad with tongs and use a knife to scrape off thorns or hairs (wear
  gloves). Trim around edge of pad to remove skin and any thorn, then
  peel remaining pad if skin is tough. Cut into about 1/2 inch squares.
  In a 3 to 4 quart pan, bring about 8 cups water to a boil. Add fresh
  cactus, reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, until cactus is barely
  tender when pierced, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse well with
  water. (Cactus is mucilaginous, much like okra.) If using canned
  cactus,omit cooking. Tear spinach into bite-sized pieces; you should
  have 3 to 4 quarts. Place half the spinach in a large salad bowl. Top
  with half each of the watercress, onion, radishes, cactus,and cheese.
  Repeat layers. (At this point, you may cover and refrigerate for up
  to 4 hours.) To serve, pit, peel, and slice avocados. Arrange
  avocados and chiles over salad. Spoon dressing over salad and mix.
  CIDER DRESSING: Whisk together oil from chiles, cider vinegar,
  garlic, soy sauce, and pepper.

           -1 lb
    1/2 c  Cream cheese (4 oz)
    1/2 c  Cottage cheese (4 oz)
      3    Eggs
  1 1/2 tb All-purpose flour
      1 md Shallot; finely chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Finely ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Cheddar cheese; shredded
           -------CARROT MIXTURE-------
      1 c  Carrots; shredded
      2    Eggs
      1 md Shallot; finely chopped
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Finely ground white pepper
      2 tb All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Monterey jack cheese;
           -shredded
      2 ts Whipping cream
           --------FOR GARNISH---------
           Parsley or watercress leaves
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Heavily butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
  Sprinkle Parmesan into mold and tap sides of mold to distribute cheese
  evenly over base and sides. Turn upside down and tap to remove excess
  cheese.
  
  For spinach mixture:  Remove spinach stems and rinse leaves
  thoroughly. Coarsely chop leaves.  Immerse spinach in large pan of
  boiling water and boil for 1 minute. Drain and wring out excess
  moisture. Reserve. Using mixer or food processor fitted with plastic
  blade, blend cream cheese and cottage cheese together, making sure
  there are no lumps in cream cheese. Add eggs, flour, shallot, salt,
  pepper, spinach, and cheddar cheese. Mix well, taste for seasoning,
  and reserve.
  
  For carrot mixture:  Immerse carrots in pan of boiling water and boil
  for 3 minutes.  Drain well.  Reserve. Using mixer or food processor
  fitted with plastic blade, blend eggs, shallot, ginger, salt, and
  pepper. Slowly add flour, Jack cheese, and cream and blend well.
  
  To assemble, spoon half of spinach mixture into pan, then spoon the
  carrot mixture carefully over spinach. Finish with rest of spinach.
  You will have three distinct layers. Use a spatula to smooth top,
  making sure it is perfectly even before placing in oven. Bake for 50
  to 60 minutes or until puffed but not brown on top. Let cool at least
  1 hour and turn out into rectangular platter.  Refrigerate for 2
  hours. To serve, slice 1-inch pieces and overlap on serving platter.
  Garnish with parsley or watercress leaves. Serve at room temperature.
  
  Note:  This may be prepared 3 days in advance and kept in
  refrigerator. This terrine may be served warm by slicing and heating
  in a 350 degree F. oven for 15 minutes.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------SPINACH-FETA FILLING-------------------------
  1 1/4 lb Spinach; fresh, stemmed and
           --washed
      1 tb Olive oil
      3 bn Scallions, trimmed and
           --chopped (1-1/2 c)
    1/4 c  Feta cheese; crumbled
      2 tb Parmesan cheese, freshly
           --grated
      2 tb Dill; fresh, chopped
      1 tb Lemon juice
           Salt & pepper, to taste
      2 lg Egg whites

MMMMM-----------------------PHYLLO PASTRY----------------------------
      8    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18")
      1 lg Egg white
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Poppy or sesame seeds, or a
           --combination
 
     To make filling: Put spinach with water still clinging to the
  leaves in a large pot. Cover and cook over medium heat until the
  spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. Drain and refresh with cold
  water. Squeeze the spinach quite dry and chop. In nonstick skillet,
  heat oil over medium heat. Add scallions and saute until softened, 2
  to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium-sized bowl and stir in spinach,
  feta, Parmesan, dill and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper.
  Beat egg whites lightly with a fork and stir into the spinach mixture.
  
      To form phyllo rolls: Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat
  to 350 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet lightly with nonstick cooking
  spray or line with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together
  egg white, oil and salt. Lay one sheet of phyllo on a work surface
  with a short side toward you. Brush lower half of the sheet with the
  egg-white mixture. Repeat this step with a second sheet of phyllo and
  set on top of the first. Spoon one-quarter of the spinach filling
  along one long edge. Tuck in the side edges and roll up, jelly-roll
  fashion. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the
  remaining phyllo, egg-white mixture and filling, making 4 rolls in
  all. Brush tops of the rolls lightly with the egg-mixture and
  sprinkle with seeds, if desired. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. With a
  serrated knife, cut each roll diagonally into 9 pieces and serve hot.
  
  The rolls may be prepared, baked and sliced up to 2 days in advance.
  Reheat in a 350 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until heated
  through. Makes 36 appetizers.

      2 lg Tomatoes, chopped (fresh
           Only!)

MMMMM---------------------------CREPES--------------------------------
      8    Basic Crepes

MMMMM------------------------WHITE SAUCE-----------------------------
      3 tb Rice
      1 c  Rice milk
           Seasonings to taste
    1/4 c  Onion, chopped or minced
           Finely
 
  In a large skillet, saute mushrooms quickly  in balsamic vinegar or
  cooking sherry until browned. Season to taste. Remove mushrooms from
  skillet and set aside.  Wipe down skillet, saute onion in vinegar or
  sherry, when translucent and tender, add spinach. As spinach wilts,
  add scallions, parsley, basil or dill. Continue to saute until
  vegetables are tender and little liguid remains.  Add chopped
  tomatoes and saute for a few minutes to heat through.  Add reserved
  mushrooms. Taste and adjust seasonings.
  
  For sauce, put into blender rice, rice milk seasonings, and onion.
  Process until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan and heat through.
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Roll up crepes with filling, place side by
  side on a baking sheet.  Pour white sauce over crepes and heat for 10
  to 15 min in oven.
  
  Serve hot.
  
  When I make the crepes, I always end up with 11 or 12, not 8. On
  Sunday, it worked out perfectly, I had 12 crepes and all the filling
  used up. Credit goes to JULAGAY (address name, there was no *regular*
  name) for the white sauce. I found it in the archives and it worked
  great! However, I was wondering, what are rice polishings? I just
  used cooked rice. Enjoy! In case I don't post again, I wish everyone
  the best over the holidays and in the new year!  May we all enjoy
  extremely good health in the coming year!

      1 tb Yeast
      1 c  Warm water
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 tb Oil
      3 c  Unbleached flour
    1/2 ts Salt

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 c  TVP granules or flakes
    7/8 c  Boiling water
      1 ts Oregano
      1 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Fennel seeds
      1 tb Olive oil
      2 c  Mushrooms, sliced
     10 oz Frozen chopped spinach,
           -thawed and drained
      6 oz Tomato paste
    1/4 c  Water
           Soymilk or oil for brushing
           -top crust
 
  Dough:  In a large bowl, mix together yeast, water, and sugar. Let
  stand 5 minutes.  Add oil, flour, and salt. Knead about 5 minutes
  into a smooth, elastic ball of dough, Cover and let rise until double
  in size. Punch down. Filling:  Mix together TVP, boiling water,
  oregano, basil, and fennel seeds. In a large skillet, heat olive oil.
  Saute TVP mixture for a few minutes. Stir in mushrooms, spinach,
  tomato paste, and water until heated through. Preheat oven to 375
  degrees. Roll the dough into a large oblong shape, spread filling
  evenly on top and roll up like a jelly roll. Brush top with a little
  bit of milk or oil. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. If crust begins to
  brown too much, cover with foil during the last 5 or 10 minutes. Cut
  into 16 slices to serve. Note: I have used half the oil in the bread
  and 1/3 the oil in the filling with good results. Also, salt is
  really needed in the filling (if you like salt).

 Categories: Cooking liv, Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  :          For the Stuffed Chicken:
        1 lb whole chicken breasts --
  :          boned but not skinne
    1 1/2 TB crushed ice
        3 TB well chilled heavy cream
      1/4 c  firmly packed cooked,
  :          squeezed,
  :          and chopped spinach --
  :          (about 1/2 pound fre
      3/4 ts salt
      1/4 ts crushed fennel seeds
      1/4 ts freshly grated lemon rind
      1/8 ts freshly grated nutmeg
      1/8 ts freshly ground pepper
        1 TB vegetable oil
  :          For the Sauce:
      1/2 c  Madeira
      3/4 c  canned chicken broth
        1 ts arrowroot dissolved in 1
        TB water
  
  For the Stuffed Chicken:
  
  Arrange the chicken breasts skin side down on a cutting board, making
  sure the skin is evenly stretched over the breasts. Remove the fillet
  strip from each breast, discard the white tendon, and in a food
  processor grind the fillets. Add the ice, blend the mixture until the
  piece is absorbed, and with the motor running add the cream.
  
  Add the spinach, the salt, the fennel seeds, the rind, the nutmeg,
  and the pepper and blend the filling well, scraping down the sides.
  Turn the breasts skin side up and beginning at the pointed end p ull
  the skin back carefully, leaving the thin transparent membranes
  attached along at the opposite end. Spread 3 tablespoons of the
  spinach filling evenly over each breast, smoothing it, and stretch
  the skin over the filling for another use such as miniature quenelles
  made by poaching small balls of it in clear soup. Chill the chicken,
  wrapped tightly in plastic wrap for one hour. In a large ove n proof
  skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but
  not smoking, add the chicken, skin side down, and season it with salt
  and pepper. Saute the chicken for 1 - 2 minutes, or until the skin is
  golden brown, turn it skin side up, and bake it, covered, in a
  preheated 400 degree oven for 10 minutes. Transfer the chicke n to a
  cutting board and let it stand, covered loosely with foil, for 5
  minutes.
  
  Make the sauce while the chicken is standing: pour off the fat from
  the skillet, add the Madeira, and boil it, scraping up the brown
  bits, until it is reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Add the broth an d
  boil the mixture, stirring for 1 minute. Stir the arrowroot mixture,
  add it to the skillet, whisking, for 1 minute.
  
  Holding a knife at a 45 degree angle slice the chicken crosswise and
  arrange the slices, overlapping them slightly, on 4 heated plates.
  Spoon some of the remaining sauce separately Yield:

        1 c  Low sodium Chicken broth --
  :          defatted
  :          WILD MUSHROOM SAUCE:
    1 1/2 c  low sodium chicken broth --
  :          defatted
      1/2 c  mushroom pieces --
  :          assortment
        1 ts sugar substitute --
  :          optional
      1/2 ts low sodium soy sauce
        1 ts cornstarch -- dissolved in
        1 TB water
  :          BEANS AND POTATOES:
        1 lb green beans
        4    whole red potatoes
  :          Freshly ground nutmeg
  :          freshly ground black pepper
      1/2 c  cranberry sauce, whole
  :          berry
  
  FLATTEN each slice of turkey gently between two sheets of wax paper to
  between 1/8 and 1/4-inch thick. Chill the cutlets until ready to stuff
  them. (Wrap in wax paper to prevent drying.)
  
  MUSHROOM SAUCE:  place the broth and mushroom pieces in a saucepan.
  Add sugar (aspertame, if using) and soy. Cover. Set heat to lowest
  possible. The idea is to flavor the broth, not to reduce the sauce.
  Use a diffuser, if necessary.
  
  SET UP STEAMER:  Scrub potatoes; cut into 1 inch chunks or use the
  salad reds. Wash and trim beans; cut into bites, optional.
  
  STUFFING STEP #1:  Wash and spin-dry fresh spinach. Rough chop. Spray
  a skillet with vegetable cooking spray, add the onion and garlic, and
  saute over moderate heat until the onion is translucent, about 3 to 4
  minutes. Add the wine, raise the heat, and bring to a boil, burning
  off the strong smell of alcohol (about 1 to 1-1/2 mins); then add the
  spinach. Cover; cook for 2 minutes to wilt the spinach. Remove from
  heat. Set up a sieve and transfer the spinach and onion to it. Let it
  drain until the spinach is cool enough to handle.
  
  STEP #2: While spinach is cooling, measure and mince fresh parsley,
  thyme, and basil. Measure the lemon juice and zest and set aside.
  Gently squeeze excess moisture from the spinach, (chop some more if
  needed), place in a bowl. Flavor with herbs and lemon. Stir in the
  breadcrumbs, almond dust, if using, and egg; mix well.
  
  STUFF AND ROLL:  Place a turkey cutlet on a work surface and spread
  evenly with portion of spinach mixture. Roll up the cutlets.
  
  SHOWTIME: Heat oven to 350F. Spray a the saute pan with vegetable
  cooking spray and place over moderate heat. Add the turkey rolls,
  seam side down and sear/brown; turning, to brown on all sides, about
  5 minutes. Add 1 cup chicken broth and heat.  Put pan, covered in
  oven. - Bake about 15 minutes. Remove cover. Bake about 4 to 5
  minutes. - Meanwhile start the steamer and steam vegetables until
  just tender (17 mins). Keep warm. - Remove turkey from oven. Turn off
  heat. - Optional: Drain the liquid to the musroom sauce. - Keep rolls
  warm in the cooling oven. - Thicken sauce with cornstarch mixture. -
  Arrange food on heated plates. Sprinkle potatoes and beans with a
  little ground nutmeg and pepper. Ladle rolls with sauce. Serve with a
  small scoop of cranberry sauce (or sideof shrub); a small salad of
  endive with ranch dressing may also be served. Recipe By : New Spa

      Title: SPINACH/CHEESE STROMBOLI
 Categories: Italian, Vegetables, Ethnic
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 pk Yeast
      2 lb Ricotta
      2 ts Sugar
      1 pk Spinach, frozen chopped
           -(cooked)
    1/3 c  -Warm water
      4 c  Flour
      1 c  Parmesan
      3 tb Butter; in pieces
    1/2 lb Mozzarella, sliced
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter; melted
      1 c  -Ice water (without cubes)
           Sesame seeds
 
  Preheat oven to 200 degrees for 15 minutes and turn off. Combine
  yeast, sugar and warm water in a small mixing bowl. Set aside for 5
  minutes until foamy. In the workbowl of a food processor, add flour,
  butter pieces and salt. Process for 20 seconds.  Add ice water to
  yeast. With the processor running, add yeast-water mixture gradually,
  until all of the moisture is absorbed and the dough leaves the side
  of the bowl. Process for an additional 60 seconds. Transfer dough
  from the workbowl to a large greased mixing bowl. Cover with a
  kitchen towel and place in warm off oven. Allow to rise until
  doubled, approximately 1-1/2 hours.
  
  In a medium mixing bowl, combine ricotta, spinach and parmesan cheese.
  
  Punch down the risen dough and transfer to a floured rolling surface.
  With quick, hard strokes, roll dough into a large rectangle, approx-
  imately 1/2 inch thick. Layer one-half of the mozzarella cheese
  evenly down the center leaving approximately three inches of exposed
  dough on either side. Top with ricotta-spinach mixture and the
  remaining mozza- rella. Overlap the exposed dough over the cheese
  mixture and pinch well on all sides to seal.
  
  Transfer to a large cookie sheet, seam side up.  Cover with a kitchen
  towel and return to the warmed oven. Allow to rise until doubled, ap-
  proximately 45 minutes. Brush loaf with melted butter and sprinkle
  with sesame seeds. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or until
  loaf is well browned and hollow sounding when thumped.

      1 tb Flour
      1 c  Milk
           Salt, pepper and nutmeg
 
  EGG PASTA: Combine the flour and the salt in a bowl, make a well in
  the middle, add the egg and the olive oil. Using your fingers,
  lightly and gradually work the egg into the flour so that it is
  completely distributed throughout. When it is well combined, press
  the mixture together to form a dough. Turn it out onto a counter and
  begin to work it together. If it is too dry, add drops of water, a
  few at a time, to moisten the dough and help it come together. Knead
  the dough for about 10 minutes, until it feels smooth and supple. Put
  it in a plastic bag or wrap it in plastic, and set it aside to rest
  at least half an hour, preferably an hour before rolling it out.
  LASAGNE: Prepare the pasta dough and set it aside to rest. Grate or
  slice the cheese; then prepare the tomato sauce and spinach-cheese
  filling. Heat the oil in a wide skillet, add the onion, garlic and
  marjoram or oregano and saute until the onion is transparent and
  soft. Season with salt; then add the tomatoes and wine. Cook slowly
  until the sauce is thickened. If the tomatoes are overly tart,
  correct the acidity by adding a pinch or two of sugar. Once they are
  cooked, pass them through a food mill; then season to taste with a
  few drops of vinegar, freshly ground black pepper and more salt if
  needed. SPINACH-CHEESE FILLING: Remove the stems from the spinach;
  discard any bruised or yellow leaves. Wash the spinach well in 2
  changes of water. Roughly chop the leaves into small pieces about an
  inch square. In a wide pan, heat the oil and saute the onion for
  several minutes; then add half the garlic, the spinach leaves and a
  sprinkling of salt. Cook until the spinach is wilted; then remove it
  to a bowl and combine it with the ricotta, eggs, Parmesan, the
  remaining garlic and the parsley and lemon peel. Season to taste with
  salt, freshly ground pepper and a scraping or two of nutmeg.
  BECHAMEL: Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour, and cook over
  low flame for 2-to-3 minutes, stirring continuously. Scald the milk
  in a separate pan, then pour it into the flour-butter mixture,
  whisking as you do so. Season with salt, pepper and a scraping of
  nutmeg and continue to cook the sauce for 15 minutes over low heat,
  giving an occasional stir. Roll the dough thin, and cut the final
  strips into pieces that will fit your baking pan. Bring a pot of
  water to a boil and add salt. Have ready a large bowl of cold water.
  Cook several pieces of dough at a time. Remove them when they rise to
  the surface, and put them in the cold water to cool; spread on a
  kitchen towel. Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking
  dish and spread half the bechamel over the bottom. Piece together
  several strips of the pasta so that they cover the bottom and hang
  over the edges of the baking dish. (Later they will be folded over
  the top, effectively sealing in the fillings.) Spread 1/2 the tomato
  sauce over this first layer of pasta and cover with 1/2 the
  mozzarella. Put down another layer of pasta and cover this with 1/2
  the spinach-cheese filling. Continue with more pasta, tomato and
  mozzarella, pasta and spinach-cheese filling. Finish by laying 1-or-2
  strips of pasta down the center and folding the overhanging edges
  over the top. Cover with the remaining bechamel sauce. Cover the
  lasagna with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and
  continue baking for another 15 minutes, or until the top is puffed
  and browned. Let the lasagne rest for a few minutes; then cut it into
  pieces and serve. NOTE: Lasagne can also be made by using commercial
  fresh pasta sheets,

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Margarine
      2 md Onion, chopped
      2 pk (10-oz each) frozen chopped
           Spinach thawed and squeezed
           Dry
      1    Lightly beaten egg
    1/2 c  Chopped walnuts/almonds/
           Pecan
    1/3 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
    3/4 ts Salt
           Fresh ground black pepper
      1 ts Dried dill
      1 lb Phyllo leaves
  1 1/2    Stick margarine melted
           Poppy seeds
 
  In a large saucepan, cook the onions in 2 Tb margarine until soft, not
  brown. Add the well squeezed spinach, egg, nuts, raisins, parsley,
  salt, pepper and dill. Mix well. Taste for adequate seasoning. Thaw
  the phyllo in the refrigerator for at least a day before using.
  Unwrap and unrool dough, covering it with a damp, well-wrung towel to
  keep it from drying out as you work. With scissors, cut the dough in
  half lengthwise, all at once, rather than sheet by sheet, and stack
  all together. Work off this stack. Brush some melted margarine along
  half the top strip of dough. FOld the ungreased half over the greased
  half and place a spoon of filling in one corner. Fold the strip over,
  making a triangle. Continue making triangles as you fold the strip
  up, like folding a flag. Tuck under any ragged edges and brush top of
  triangle with margarine. Sprinkle with poppy seeds. Place on a baking
  tray so as to get as many as possible on one sheet. Continue filling
  strips of dough until all filling is used. Bake the boreks, one tray
  at a time, in the upper third of a preheated 375 degree oven about
  20-25 minutes or until golden, turning pan once after about 15
  minutes. Cool the boreks on a wire rack for a few minutes before
  serving so condensation doesn't form and soften the crust. Serve
  warm. Assembled boreks can be refrigerated for a day or two before
  baking, or after baking freeze them on a cookie sheet and then box
  them. Rewarm boreks in a 375 degree oven about 10 minutes.

      Title: SPINATSUPPE (SPINACH SOUP)
 Categories: Norwegian, Soups/stews, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Spinach; fresh -=OR=-
      2 pk Frozen chopped spinach
      2 qt Chicken stock; fresh or
           -canned
      3 tb Butter
      2 tb Flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
      2    Eggs; hard-cooked & sliced
 
  Wash the fresh spinach thoroughly under cold running water to remove
  any sand. Drain by shaking it vigorously by hand or in a lettuce
  basket, then chop coarsely. If frozen spinach is used, thoroughly
  defrost and drain it. Bring 2 quarts of chicken stock to a boil in a
  3-4 quart saucepan and add the fresh or frozen chopped spinach.
  Simmer uncovered about 6 to 8 minutes, then pour the entire contents
  of the pan into a sieve set over a large bowl. Press down hard on the
  spinach with the back of a wooden spoon to extract all it's juices.
  Set the liquid aside in the bowl and chop the cooked spinach very
  fine. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in the saucepan. When the foam
  subsides, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the flour. With a
  wire whisk, beat the hot stock into this white roux a little at a
  time. Return the saucepan to the heat and, stirring it constantly,
  bring it to the boil. Then add the spinach. Season soup with salt,
  pepper and nutmeg. Half cover the pan and simmer soup over low heat
  about 5 minutes longer. Stir occasionally. Garnish each serving of
  soup with a few slices of hard-cooked egg. On festive occasions, such
  as Easter, spinatsuppe is often served with a stuffed egg half
  floating in each soup bowl. To make these, remove the yolks from 2 or
  3 hard-cooked eggs (depending on how many people you plan to serve)
  and mash them to a paste with about 1 to 2 teaspoons of softened
  butter. Roll the mixture into little balls and nestle 2 or 3 into
  each halved egg white.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Appetizers
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      2 c  Split peas, dried
      4 c  ;water
      1    4-inch strip kombu
      1 md Carrot; halved lengthwise
      6    Garlic cloves
    1/4 sm Onion
      1    Bay leaf
      2    Parsley sprigs
      3 tb Arrowroot
      4 tb ;water
      2 tb Smoked yeast
      1 ts Sea salt
      2 pn Ground nutmeg
 
   Wash the split peas, sort out any tiny rocks or odd peas, and put
  the peas in a medium saucepan with the water. Add the kombu, carrot,
  garlic, onion, bay leaf, and parsley. Cover the pan tightly and
  simmer until the peas are very soft (about 35 to 40 minutes). the
  mixture should be cooked until there is very little, if any, liquid
  left.
  
   Remove the bay leaf and parsley. Pour the mixture into the blender
  (in two batches), and blend until smooth.
   Return to the pan.
  
   In a small bowl, mix the arrowroot, water, yeast, salt and nutmeg.
  Add these seasonings to the pea mixture.
   stir until well blended. bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring
  constantly. When the pate detaches itself from the sides of the pan
  remove from the heat. If the pate seems too liquid, just add another
  tablespoon of arrowroot, dissolved in a tablespoon of water, to make
  the mixture firmer. turn the pate mixture out into a lightly oiled
  serving dish and refrigerate. If the mixture becomes firm enough, you
  can unmold it onto a plate and garnish with more parsley sprigs.
  
   Variation:
  
   In place of the split peas, use 2 cups of lentils.
   Increase the amount of water to about 5 cups. Insert 4 cloves into
  the carrot halves. Along with the kombu, carrots, garlic, onion, bay
  leaf, and parsley, add the leafy tops from 4 stalks of celery. Cook
  these ingredients with the lentils and water for 30 to 35 minutes.
  Remove the cloves from the carrots. Then puree the mixture as in the
  recipe above.

       30    minutes.
  
  SPICES: Heat oil in a skillet, saute the onions until golden brown.
  Add the asafetida & a few seconds later the rest of the spices in the
  order listed. Saute, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Pour into
  the prepared split pea mixture & let cool.
  
  ASSEMBLY & COOKING: Divide the dough into 10 balls. Roll each ball
  out very thinly into a circle, but not so thinly that it will rip
  when you pick it up.  Cut each resultant disk in half. Set each half
  aside, preferably covered with the damp towel to prevent drying. Do
  all the balls of dough in this way.
  
  Take one halved disk, heap one tablespoon of split filling onto one
  half of the disk.  Lightly dampen the edges of the dough with water &
  seal into a triangular shape. Repeat until all disks have been fileld
  & sealed in this way.
  
  Heat oil in a wok, enough to deep fry about 4 samosas at once. When
  the oil is hot, carefully drop 4 samosas into the wok. Fry for 3 to 4
  minutes & flip over. The pastry should be a deep golden brown. When
  cooked, remove with a slotted spoon & drain well.
  
  Either serve immediately or let cool & freeze.  Reheat in an oven
  preheated to 300F for 10 minutes or so.  Be careful as they will burn
  very easily.

  Richard II (1377-1399) The leek was a popular vegetable in the Middle
  Ages, perhaps because of the belief that it stimulated the appetite.
  But leek also had its harmful effects
  : "It causes headache and gives bad dreams . . . after eating it, some
  lettuce, purslane, or endive should be taken, to temper its heating
  effects." What follows is a medieval cousin to vichyssoise. 1. Remove
  green tops and roots of leeks. Cut white section in half lengthwise
  and once across the middle. Wash thoroughly. 2. Melt butter in a
  heavy saucepan. Toss leeks to coat, and saute over a gentle flame
  until they begin to wilt (about 5 minutes). 3.Add wine, salt, and
  pepper to taste. Simmer an additional Io to 15 minutes until leeks
  are done. 4.Blend in beurre manie to thicken just before serving.
  5.Serve in soup bowls over toast or croutons.

      Title: SPONGE CAKE (PAN DI SPAGNA)
 Categories: Cooking liv, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        4 lg eggs -- separated
        1 ts vanilla extract
      3/4 c  sugar
      1/2 c  all-purpose flour
      1/2 c  cornstarch
  :       pn salt
  
  Butter and line with parchment paper a 9-or 10-inch round cake pan
  that is 2 inches deep.
  
  In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the yolks with the vanilla. Whisk in
  half the sugar and continue to beat until very light and frothy,
  about 5 minutes, either by hand, with a hand mixer set at medium
  speed, or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whip.
  
  Combine the flour and cornstarch and sift once to aerate. In a clean,
  dry bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt until they hold a very
  soft peak, either by hand, with a hand mixer set at medium speed, or
  in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whip. Beating faster, add the
  remaining sugar in a very slow stream, beating until the egg whites
  hold a firm peak.
  
  Fold the yolk mixture into the whites with a rubber spatula. Sift the
  flour and cornstarch over the eggs in 3 additions, folding them in
  gradually. Do not overmix the batter.
  
  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake at 350
  degrees for 30 to 40 minutes, until it is well risen and feels firm
  when pressed gently with the palm of your hand. Immediately loosen
  the layer from the side of the pan with a small knife or spatula.
  Invert the layer onto a rack and leave the paper stuck to it. Turn
  the layer right side up and cool it on a rack.
  
  Unless you are going to use the layer within a few hours, double-wrap
  tightly in plastic and keep in the refrigerator up to 5 days, or
  freeze. Yield: 1 9- or 10-inch layer cake

      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Lemon extract;

      1 c  Sour cream;
 
  Cream shortening and sugar together at medium speed until well
  blended. Add eggs and flavorings, and beat at medium speed until
  creamy, scraping down the bowl before and after adding eggs and
  flavorings. Stir flour, nutmeg if desired, baking powder, baking soda
  and salt together to blend well; add, along with sour cream to
  creamy. Cover and refrigerate from 3 hours to overnight. Return dough
  to room temperature. Roll out on a lightly floured board to 1/4"
  thick.  Cut with a 2 1/2 round cutter or an equivalent (see Note
  below). Place dough on cookie sheets that have been sprayed with pan
  spray or lined luminum foil.  Bake at 350 for 8 to 10 minutes, or
  until cookies are lightly browned. Remove them to a wire rack and
  cool to room temperature.
    NOTE: Nutritive values for these cookies are based on the use of
  the 2 1/2 round cutter and weight of a little over 1 ounce per
  cookie. You may use other cutters as long as the finished cookie
  weighs about 1 ounce per cookie, and you might even make a 2-ounce
  cookie and figure the nutritive value and exchanges as twice those
  for the smaller cookie. You may add flavorings other than vanilla and
  lemon; if add nuts, raisins and the like, however, you are altering
  the nutritve values and exchanges for each cookie.

  left together for long.
  
  Mix all in a glass or enamel bowl and dab on stained area. Leave on

  Hints: Fumes from this cleaner may seem strong, so work in a
  WELL-VENTILATED AREA. Perform a PATCH TEST first. Dab a bit of
  cleaner onto an inconspicuous part of the garment: inside seam. Wait,
  make sure color doesn't run or babric doesn't seem badly affected.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 c  Cold water
    1/2    Lemon
      6    Baby artichokes
      6    Thin asparagus spears,
           -trimmed, cut into 1" pieces
      8 oz Orecchlette (ear-shaped)
           -pasta
      1 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Chopped scallions
      2    Garlic cloves, slivered
    1/3 c  Oil-cured black olives,
           -pitted
    1/2 c  Tiny green peas (if using
           -frozen, thawed)
      4 tb Fresh grated Parmesan cheese
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  (From "The New Basics Cookbook) by Julee Rosso and Shiela Lukins.
  Workman.)
  
  Fill the mixing bowl with the cold water and squeeze the lemon juice
  into it. Drop the lemon half into the water as well. Set the bowl
  aside.
  
  Using a sharp knife, trim off and discard the top 1/2" of each
  artichoke. Dip the cut tops into the acidulated water (to keep them
  from turning brown).
  
  Pull the outer leaves off the artichokes, leaving a core of tender
  green leaves. Gently pry open the artichokes; using a small melon
  baller, scoop out and discard the chokes.
  
  Cut the artichokes vertically into three or four slices, dropping
  them into the acidulated water as you work.
  
  Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Drain the
  artichokes, and add them to the pan. Simmer for 10 minutes. Then
  drain the artichokes, reserving the cooking liquid and rinse them
  under cold water. Set them aside.
  
  Bring the reserve artichoke cooking liquid to a boil, and add the
  asparagus. Simmer for 3 minutes; then drain, again reserving the
  liquid. Rinse the asparagus under cold water, and set it aside.
  
  Bring a large pot of fresh water to a boil. Add the orecchlette, and
  cook at a rolling boil until just tender.
  
  Meanwhile, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a
  saucepan. Saute the scallions and garlic for 3 minutes. Then stir in
  the olives, peas, reserved artichokes and asparagus, remaining 1
  tablespoon butter, 1/3 cup of the reserved cooking liquid, and 3
  tablespoons of the Parmesan. Stir well, and cook just until heated
  through, 2 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water,
  and transfer the sauce to a heated serving bowl.
  
  Drain the pasta, and toss it in the bowl with the sauce until well
  coated. Season with salt, pepper and the additional 1 tablespoon
  grated Parmesan. Serve immediately.

      Title: SPRING ROLLS (WILLIAMS)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
     12    Spring roll wrappers (rice
           Paper)
      6 oz Firm tofu (not silken)
      2 tb Or more soy sauce, tamari,
           Or Bragg's liquid aminos
      6 oz Thin rice noodles
           (vermicelli)
     48    Fresh mint leaves
    1/4    Head leaf lettuce
      3    Shredded carrots (optional)
        x  Spring roll sauce (see
           Below)
 
  You can get the spring roll wrappers at an oriental grocery store,
  and they will keep on your shelf indefinitely. They are fragile; keep
  them flat and handle them gently.  Be sure they are made of rice. You
  CANNOT substitute egg roll wrappers in this recipe. The round ones,
  about 8 1/2 inches in diameter, are the easiest to work with. I like
  the Flying Goose brand, although the brand with a rose on the front
  works well, too.
  
  Slice the tofu into 1/2 inch slices.  Pat dry with paper towels.
  Press it for an hour or so if you have time. Put the tofu slices on a
  nonstick cookie pan. Add the soy sauce, trying to keep it on the tofu
  as much as possible.  Bake at 325 for about 45 minutes, turning
  occasionally and adding more soy sauce if they look like they can
  absorb more. When they are nice and brown and dry, cut them into
  strips, about the size of French fries.  You will need one strip per
  spring roll. (If you don't have time to bake the tofu, cut it into
  strips and fry it with the soy sauce on a nonstick skillet for a few
  minutes, carefully turning each strip, trying to crisp it up a little
  on each side.) Set aside.
  
  Wash and dry the lettuce.  Tear it into 3 or 4 inch pieces, removing
  stems and crisp veins.  Your lettuce needs to be on the limp side.
  Any crisp pieces will tear the spring roll wrappers when you try to
  roll them.
  
  Wash and dry the mint.  Remove all stems! Set aside. (If you can't get
  fresh mint, you can substitute fresh cilantro, but the spring rolls
  will taste completely different, and my family would rather I not
  make them if I don't have mint.)
  
  Shred or grate the carrots.  Again, they need to be small enough
  pieces that they are not crisp.  You may prefer your spring rolls
  without the carrots.
  
  Throw the rice vermicelli into boiling water and cook until just done,
  about 2 or 3 minutes.  Pour into a colander, and rinse with cool
  water. The noodles need to be well drained and cool enough to handle.
  Set aside.
  
  Put an inch or two of water in a pan that is big enough to hold the
  spring rolls.  (Cool water works fine). Separate the wrappers, and
  stack them in the water, making sure each one is completely covered
  with water before putting in the next one.  Leave the wrappers in the
  water until they are flexible (about 2 or 3 minutes). Remove the
  whole stack at once, and place them on a clean wet kitchen towel,
  covering them with another damp towel.
  
  Now you are ready to assemble them.  Carefully remove one wrapper and
  put it on another surface (I use a bamboo sushi mat, but you could
  easily use another damp towel. If you use a plate, dump off the
  excess water between each spring roll.)  Working quickly, put onto
  the wrapper 3 or 4 small pieces of lettuce, 4 leaves of mint, a
  handful of rice noodles, one strip of tofu, and a few tablespoons of
  carrots if desired. Quickly fold the bottom of the wrapper over the
  pile, fold in the sides, and continue to roll up.  After I've done
  four or five, I wrap each in plastic wrap to keep them from drying
  out too much. If one of them is falling apart, wrap it in plastic
  wrap immediately. Have a piece of plastic wrap cut and ready in case
  one is falling apart. (If you are serving them to company, start over
  with a new wrapper on the ones that are falling apart.) If a lot of
  them are falling apart, then something may not be drained well
  enough, or you may be trying to fill them too full, or some of your
  wrappers may be defective with too many tears and holes, or too thin.
  
  Serve cold or room temperature with sauces of your choice. NOTE: you
  do not EVER cook these spring rolls. When you finish rolling them up,
  they are done!  They will keep in the refrigerator for a day or two.
  They travel well for lunches and outings.  For an appetizer, serve
  one or two per person.  As a main course, count on at least three per
  person.
  
  SAUCES:  These are good with a peanut sauce, but that wouldn't be
  fatfree. They are also good with a plum sauce. If anyone has a good
  plum sauce recipe, please send it to me. I serve them with the sweet
  sauce below AND a bottled chili sauce (I like Sriracha Hot Chili
  Sauce, made by Huy Fong Foods, Inc.)

      Title: SPRING VEGETABLE STEW
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 md Leeks; the white parts only
           -sliced in 1/4-inch rounds
      2 lg Artichokes
      2    Lemons; juice only
    3/4 lb Fava beans, shelled
           -(if available)
      1 lb Thick asparagus
      1 tb Butter
      1 tb Virgin olive oil
      5 sm Garlic cloves; unpeeled
           Salt
  1 1/2 c  Water
      6 sm Turnips; peeled and halved
      6 sm Carrots
           - peeled & halved lengthwise
      1 lb Fresh peas; shelled, -=OR=-
      1 c  -Frozen peas
           Additional butter, to taste
           Chopped fresh herbs; such as
           -Parsley, Thyme, Basil,
           -Marjoram
           Freshly milled pepper
 
  WASH THE SLICED LEEKS really well, as they are always sandy. Trim the
  artichokes. (See instructions in the recipe "Artichokes and Peas.")
  Keep the finished pieces in a bowl covered with water and the juice
  of one lemon. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add the fava
  beans, and cook for about a minute. Scoop them out and put them in a
  bowl of cold water, reserving the cooking water. Slip each bean out
  of its skin and set aside. Cut the top 3 inches off the asparagus.
  (Save the stalks for soup.) If the tips are very thick, slice them in
  half lengthwise. Warm the butter and olive oil in a wide skillet and
  add the leeks, artichokes, garlic, and salt lightly. Toss to coat
  everything with the oil and squeeze the juice of the second lemon
  over all. Cook gently for several minutes, without frying, then add
  the water. Simmer, partially covered, for about 15 minutes or until
  the artichokes are tender but still a little firm. Make sure there is
  always some liquid in the pan, adding more water as needed in small
  increments. Return the water used for the fava beans to the heat and
  bring to a boil. Separately blanch the turnips, carrots and asparagus
  and add them to the stewed vegetables along with the fresh peas. (If
  you're using frozen peas, add them during the last 2 minutes or so.)
  Cook gently until all the vegetables are tender and the liquid is
  reduced to a syrup. Taste for salt. Stir in the additional butter and
  the herbs and season with pepper.
