  I did not make this -- only tasted the results and it was very good. Also,
  I can't imagine getting 16 slices from a 9 inch cheesecake, but that's what
  the directions said.  I definitely had a large piece than that. ;-)~

  Here's a cheesecake recipe I intend to try for Thanksgiving dinner. I found
  it in the 10/21/91 issue of New York Magazine and thought I'd share it with
  all of you.
  
  PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE WITH MAPLE/BOURBON SAUCE
  
  MAPLE - BOURBON SAUCE (recipe below)
  
  Crust: Lightly butter a 10x2 inch round cake pan. Combine gingersnap
  crumbs, nut, and butter in a bowl, and mix well. Press mixture firmly into
  prepared pan, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Make Filling: In a bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add sugars and
  spices, beat until light in texture, 3-4 min. Add pumpkin puree and mix
  until just blended. Stir in eggs one at a time, scraping sides of bowl
  after each addition. Stir in cream.
  
  Pour batter into crust, and put cake pan in a roasting pan. Add hot water
  to roasting pan halfway up sides of cake pan. Bake in center of oven until
  cheesecake is firm to touch and slightly puffed, about 50 minutes.
  
  Let cheesecake cool on a wire rack for about 45 minutes. Cover, and
  refrigerate for at least 4 hours. When cheesecake is completely chilled,
  lower pan into a hotwater bath for 2-3 min. to loosen the crust. Invert a
  large, flat plate on top of cheesecake; invert pan, and remove. Put a
  second plate on bottom of cheesecake, and turn it right side up. Cut with a
  hot knife, and serve with maple/bourbon sauce.
  
  Cheesecake will keep for 4-5 days in refrigerator and 2 weeks in the
  freezer.
  
  MAPLE-BOURBON SAUCE 1/4 C. Maple Syrup 3 Tb. Bourbon 1 C. Light Cream 1/4
  Vanilla Bean, split lengthwise 3 Lg. Egg Yolks 1/4 C. Sugar 3/4 tsp.
  Cornstarch 1/3 C. Heavy Cream Whipped
  
  Combine maple syrup and bourbon in a saucepan. Over medium heat, bring to a
  boil, and cook until reduced by 1/3, about 10 minutes; set aside to cool.
  
  Put light cream and vanilla bean in a large saucepan, and bring to a boil.
  Immediately remove from heat, and let bean infuse cream for about 10
  minutes. Remove bean, and scrape pulp into cream.
  
  Whisk together egg yolks, sugar and cornstarch. Stir in 1/2 C. cream and
  return mixture to saucepan with rest of cream. Stirring continuously, cook
  over low heat until thickened enough to coat back of a wooden spoon, 5-8
  minutes.
  
  Add reduced maple syrup and bourbon, and strain through a fine sieve into a
  bowl set in ice. Stire until completely chilled, then fold in whipped
  cream.

  coconut, nuts, syrup, flour, salt, and the 1/4 cup sugar; spread in the
  bottom of partly baked pastry shell. Return pie to oven and bake for 15
  minutes; cool thoroughly. Crush the frozen blueberries and combine with the
  2/3 cup sugar; fold into the whipped cream. Pour the berry mix- ture over
  cooled coconut mixture and freeze. Serves 6.
  
  When they are in season, use 2 cups fresh blueberries to replace the frozen
  ones in this recipe; chill berry mixture before folding into cream.

           -can (2/3 cup) water           
 
  Midnight supper, perhaps for New Year's Eve or after the show, can be
  exotic in a hurry. The foods are sliced ahead, the sauces made, then all
  stowed in the refrigerator. When guests are hungry, the hostess simply
  heats the broth and sets out the makings.
  
  Genghis Khan hot pot is another name for this Chinese specialty. Or maybe
  you've seen it on restaurant menus as volcano soup. We show an
  honest-to-goodness Mongolian cooker with a charcoal chimney in the center,
  but any chafing dish or electric skillet will do as well.
  
  What's cooking. Everything on the tray is raw, of course--chunks of
  eggplant, crosscut strips of sirloin, halved mushrooms, thin slices of
  chicken breast, squares of Chinese cabbage, shucked shrimp. Fresh spinach
  to simmer along with the other foods is ready in the big red bowl. The
  broth is chicken bouillon that boasts a faint overtone of ginger.
  Individual bowls of fluffy rice are served at the same time as Hot Pot.
  
  The how-to. You pick out a few choice tidbits at a time and drop them from
  chopsticks, bamboo tongs, or fork into the lazily bubbling broth. In a few
  minutes, fish them out to dip into zesty sauces on your plate, like Peanut
  or Red Sauce, Chinese Mustard or Ginger Soy.
  
  Traditionalists poach eggs in the broth when it has taken on subtle flavor
  from the foods that have simmered in it. At the very last, the hostess may
  ladle the broth as a soup. It's delicious! Dessert? Skip it, or serve a
  fruit bowl and candied ginger with coffee or tea.
  
  Etiquette: Use one set of chopsticks for cooking and fishing out morsels
  from Hot Pot, use a second set for eating. If only one set is provided for
  each guest, simply reverse your chopsticks (large ends down) when you cook
  or help yourself to food.
  
  Oriental Hot Pot
  
  Chinese Mustard Ginger Soy Peanut Sauce Red Sauce Hot cooked rice
  
  Shortly before cooking time arrange the meats and vegetables on large tray
  or platter; use a bowl for spinach. Set out dunking sauces. Provide Bamboo
  tongs, chopsticks or long-handled forks as cooking tools for guests.
  
  Heat chicken broth in electric skillet or chafing dish (or use Mongolian
  cooker-- directions follow). Add bouillon cubes to hot broth and stir to
  dissolve; add monosodium glutamate and ginger. Heat to simmering. For
  cooking have broth barely bubbling. Each Guest picks up desired foods with
  chopsticks or whatever, drops them into the bubbling broth. When his
  tidbits are cooked, he lifts them out and dips into the sauces on his
  plate. Serve with rice. Makes 4 servings.
  
  To use Mongolian cooker, fill chimney of cooker with charcoal and add
  charcoal starter. Pour cold chicken broth into cooker. Cover cooker, then
  light charcoal. When broth is hot, continue as above.

      Title: Inca Festival Bread
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8 tb Butter                                   -cubes
    3/4 c  Milk                              1/2 c  Coarsely chopped hot
      2 lg Eggs                                     -chilies, fresh or canned
      8 oz Can cream style corn                4 oz Can whole-sweet red
  1 1/4 c  Water ground cornmeal                    -pimentos, roasted 1/2 cut
           -(white)                                 -into long strips,
     10 oz Sharp cheddar cheese ----                Other 1/2 coarsely chunked
           -1/4 cup coarsely grated          1/2 ts Baking soda
           Remainder cut into 1/4 inch         1 ts Salt
 
  In a small saucepan, melt 6 Tbsp. butter over low heat.  Do not brown.
  Preheat oven to 400.  Put remaining 2 Tbsp. butter into an 8 inch diameter
  baking casserole;  heat in oven no more than 4 to 5 minutes to avoid
  browning butter.  Rotate and tilt casserole to coat inside. Set aside. In
  large mixing bowl, beat milk and eggs.  Smoothly blend 1 cup white
  cornmeal, melted butter, corn, diced cheese, chillies, chopped red pimento,
  baking soda, salt.  Mix thoroughly.  It should have the consistency of
  southern cornbread, moderately runny but not down right liquid. If it seems
  to runny work in 1 or 2 tbsp. white cornmeal. Give butter in casserole a
  final swizzle, then pour in batter, smoothing it level. Sprinkle grated
  cheese over top and decorate with pimento strips. Do not cover. Place
  casserole, exactly in center of oven. Bake until a knife lightly pushed in
  center comes out clean and dry- usually 40 to 50 minutes. Serve at once.
  Cut into fairly thin, pie - shaped wedges. (You can let the bread cool to
  room temperature.) It stores well tightly wrapped in the refrigerator, but
  it is best not to serve it cold. One loaf makes about 8 servings.

      Title: Sunday Loaf
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 18 servings
 
      3 c  Flour                             1/2 c  Strawberry jam/preserves
    1/2 c  Sugar                             3/4 c  Milk
      4 ts Baking powder                       2 tb Butter
      1 ts Salt                                2 tb Sugar
      8 tb Butter, chilled                     2 tb Raspberry jam or
      2    Eggs                                2 tb Strawberry jam
    1/2 c  Raspberry jam/preserves or     
 
  Servings: 18
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Combine the
  flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir with a
  fork to mix all dry ingredients well. Cut the butter into small pieces and
  drop into the flour mixture. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, rub or
  cut the cold butter into the flour until mixture resembles coarse bread
  crumbs. Beat the eggs well in a small bowl, add the jam or preserves and
  milk; whisk until the mixture is blended smooth. Stir the egg mixture into
  the flour mixture and stir only until no flour streaks show--the mixture
  wil be lumpy. Spoon into the loaf pan and bake for about 1 hour 15 minutes,
  or until a straw inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow loaf to
  remain in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes before turning it out onto a rack.
  Meanwhile, make the glaze by combining the butter, sugar, and jam in a pan.
  Stir and bring to a simmer; continue stirring until dissolved and blended.
  Strain and then spoon the glaze over the loaf after it has cooled on the
  rack.

      Title: The Basic Bagel
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 c  Warm water (100 to 115                   -flour (unsifted)
           -deg.F)                             3 qt Water with 1 Tbl sugar
      2 pk Active dry yeast                         Cornmeal
      3 tb Sugar                               1    Egg yolk beaten with 1 Tbl
      3 ts Salt                                     -water
           About 5 3/4 cup all-purpose    
 
  Combine water and yeast in the large bowl of an electric mixer; let stand 5
  minutes. Stir in sugar and salt; gradually mix in 4 cup of the flour. Beat
  at medium speed for 5 minutes. With a spoon, mix in about 1 1/4 cups more
  flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out on a floured board and knead until
  smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky, about 15 minutes; add more flour as
  needed (dough should be firmer than for most other yeast breads). Place in
  a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled,
  about 40 minutes. Knead dough lightly, then divide into 12 equal pieces. To
  shape, knead each piece, forming it into a smooth ball. Holding ball with
  both hands, poke your thumbs through the center. With one thumb in the
  hole, work around perimeter, shaping bagel like a doughnut, 3 to 3 1/2
  inches across. Place shaped bagels on a lightly floured board, cover
  lightly, and let stand in a warm place for 20 minutes. Bring the
  water-sugar mixture to boiling in a 4 or 5 quart pan; adjust heat to keep
  it boiling gently. Lightly grease baking a baking sheet and sprinkle with
  cornmeal. Gently lift one bagel at a time and drop into water; boil about 4
  at a time, turning often, for 5 minutes. Lift out with a slotted spatula,
  drain briefly on a towel, and place on the baking sheet. Brush bagels with
  the egg yolk glaze and bake in  a 400 deg.F oven for about 35 to 40
  minutes, or until well browned and crusty. Cool on a rack. Makes 12.
  
  WHOLE WHEAT BAGELS -----+-----+------ Follow basic recipe, omitting sugar;
  use 3 Tbl honey instead. In place of the flour, use 2 cups whole wheat, 1/2
  cup wheat germ, and about 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour. Mix in all the
  whole wheat flour and wheat germ and 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour before
  beating dough. Then mix in about 1 1/2 cups more all-purpose flour, knead,
  and finish as directed.
  
  PUMPERNICKEL BAGELS *+* Follow basic recipe, omitting sugar; instead use 3
  Tbl dark molasses. In place of the flour use 2 cups each rye and whole
  wheat and about 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour. Add all the rye and 1 cup
  each of the whole wheat and all-purpose before beating dough. Then add
  remaining 1 cup of whole wheat and about 3/4 cup more all-purpose flour,
  knead, and finish as directed.
  
  MORE BAGEL VARIETY ----+-----+------- Try adding 1/2 cup instant toasted
  onion to the whole wheat or basic bagels; add it to the yeast mixture along
  with the sugar and salt. Or sprinkle 1/2 tsp poppy or sesame seed or 1/4
  tsp coarse salt on each glazed bagel before baking. Or add 1 Tbl caraway
  seed to pumpernickel bagels, then sprinkle each glazed bagel with 1/2 tsp
  more caraway seed before baking.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 tb Sesame seeds                        2 c  Unbleached flour
      1 c  Warm water (105 F to 115 F)         1 ts Salt
      1    Envelope dried yeast                1 tb Oil
      1 ts Sugar                                    Flour
      1 c  Cake flour                     
 
  Makes 8 5-inch rounds
  
  Oil
  
  Lightly oil 2 baking sheets and large bowl; sprinkle sheets with half of
  sesame seeds.  Combine water, yeast and sugar and let stand 5 to 10
  minutes.
  
  Steel knife:  Place cake flour, 1 1/2 cups unbleached flour, salt and yeast
  mixture in work bowl.  Blend well using on/off turns. Add remaining flour
  by tablespoonfuls (it may not be necessary to use all of it), incorporating
  after each addition with 3 to 4 on/off turns. Dough should be sticky but
  not wet; check consistency by touching. When dough is proper consistency,
  add oil and let machine run about 40 seconds (or no more than 60 seconds)
  to knead.  (Dough will appear smooth.)  Place in prepared bowl, rotating so
  all surfaces are coated with oil. Cover with damp towel, set in a warm
  place, and allow to double in bulk, about 1 hour. When dough has doubled,
  punch down. Allow to rest 30 minutes in bowl on counter top.
  
  Place racks on upper shelves and preheat overn to 500 F.  Lightly flour
  board and place dough on flour.  Cut in half, then cut each half into
  quarters to make 8 equal pieces.  Flatten each piece with palm of hand,
  then roll into a circle no more than 5 inches in diameter. Place on
  prepared sheets and sprinkle with remaining 1 Tbs sesame seeds, lightly
  pressing seeds into both sides of dough. Bake about 8 to 10 minutes, only
  until delicately browned. Do not overbake; these are better slightly
  doughy.  (It may be necessary to reverse the sheets after 6 minutes to
  brown the pita evenly.)  Allow to cool slightly.  Cut pita in half with
  scissors and separate opening.  Wrap in foil to maintain freshness if not
  served immediately.

      Title: Super Duper French Toast
 Categories: Breakfast, Breads, French
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Eggs, slightly beaten               1    Loaf French Bread
    1/2 pt (1 cup) whipping cream                   Butter, margarine or cooking
      1 c  Orange juice                             -oil
      1    To 1 1/2 ounces Orange                   Powdered sugar
           -Liqueur                       
 
  *  Mix eggs, whipping cream and orange juice.  Then add liqueur to taste.
  Pour into large casserole or glass baking dish.
  
  Remove ends from the bread and cut loaf into 12-15 slices, each about 3/4"
  thick.  Place slices in egg mixture and let stand for a few minutes to
  absorb some of the liquid; then turn so the other side of the bread can
  absorb some of the mixture. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate
  until you are ready to prepare the French Toast.  Some cooks soak the bread
  in the egg mixture overnight, refrigerated so that it becomes almost
  custardlike in texture.

  Preheat heavy skillet or electric griddle to 325-350 degrees. Melt butter,
  margarine or place oil in skillet.  Place four or five slices in to cook,
  but do not crowd.  Cook on one side until golden brown, turn and cook on
  the other side.  Remove and keep warm while you cook remaining slices,
  adding more oil or butter as needed. Place toast on serving plates and dust
  with powered sugar.  Garnish with fresh fruit, if desired, and serve with
  honey, jam or syrup of your choice.  Yields 4-5 Serv.

      1 pk Yeast                             1/2 c  Sour cream, do not use lite
    1/4 c  Warm water                               -sour cream it is not thick
  3 1/2 c  Flour                                    Enough
      1 ts Salt                                     Vanilla Sugar:
    1/2 c  Butter                              2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Crisco                          1 1/2 c  Sugar (Can use lessor use
      2    Eggs beaten                              -left over sugar in
      1 ts Vanilla                        
 
  something else.)
  
  Soften yeast in warm water, sift flour and salt in mixing bowl. Cut in
  butter and shortning until size of peas.  Blend eggs, sour cream, 1 tsp
  vanilla, yeast and water together. Add to dry mixture gently so that you
  keep the butter in little chunks.
  
  Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap for two hours or up to 4 days.
  
  Divide into two balls.  For each ball,roll out into a 6 x 12 inch
  rectangle.  Sprinkle with some of the vanilla sugar, fold in thirds, turn.
  Do this three  or four times.Roll out one more time and cut into 12 equal
  strips 1 X 6 inches. Twist, roll in vanilla sugar and put on cookie sheet.
  Do the second ball or save it for another day. The recipe makes about 24
  twists.
  
  I tried the recipe using "lite" sour cream and it was too sticky. The dough
  should not need any flour because you are using the sugar to keep the dough
  from sticking to the board.
  
  Bake at 375 for 15 to 20 min.These should be lightly browned, do not
  overcook. You will notice that there are little layers of dough with sugar
  in between.
  
  Enjoy!  Emily Jorge

      Title: Traditional Pizza Dough 1
 Categories: Pizza, Breads
      Yield: 12 servings
 
    1/4 c  Water (110 to 115 Degrees         1/4 c  Warm Water (110 to 115
           -F.)                                     -Degrees F.)
    1/2 ts Sugar                               1 tb Olive Oil (Room Temperature)
    1/2 ts Salt                            1 1/2 c  Unbleached Flour
    1/2 pk Active Dry Yeast               
 
  Additional Flour Additional Water
  
  HAND METHOD:
  
  Pour the first 1/4 Cup of water into a medium bowl and add the sugar and
  salt, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Sprinkle the yeast over the water
  mixture, stirring once to blend and let sit for 5 minutes until the top is
  bubbly and the yeast has bloomed.  Stir in the remaining warm water and the
  oil.  Place the flour in a large bowl and add the water and oil mixture to
  it.  Stir, adding enough flour to make a soft dough that will pull away
  from the sides of the
  
  bowl.  If it is too dry, add a little water a tbls at a time.
  
  Turn the dough out on a well-floured work surface, sprinkle the top with a
  little additional flour.  Knead until it become very springy, elastic and
  very smooth.  It should be light in weight, if it is heavy, you have use
  too much flour and it will not raise properly. Form into a smooth ball and
  let rest on the work surface while you wash and clean the large bowl. Spray
  with a non-stick spray.  Put the ball of dough into the bowl and turn it
  over to get some of the spray on the top. Cover with plastic wrap or a
  warm, damp, clean dishtowel. Let the dough rise in a warm, draft free place
  until double in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  If the dough rises before you are ready, punch it down in the bowl by
  kneading making sure all of the air is gone.  Turn it over and reshape it
  into a ball and let rise again.  If the top is dry, use a little olive oil
  to grease it.  You can punch the dough down and cover the bowl and keep the
  dough refrigerated for up to two days before letting it rise at room
  temperature.
  
  For a thin, crisp pizza crust punch the dough down and turn out and spread
  over a pizza pan or baking sheet or a bakers peel.  Cover with filling and
  topping, baking at once.
  
  For thicker, softer pizza crust punch the dough down and turn out shaping
  as above and then cover lightly with a clean dishtowel.  Let rise about 30
  minutes before covering with filling and topping.
  
  Makes enough dough for one 12 to 14 inch round pizza, two 7 to 8- inch
  round pizzas or one oblong pizza, or one dozen appetizer-sized pizzas.

      Title: Sourdough Starter Ii
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           INGREDIENTS:                        2 c  Bread flour
      2 c  Lukewarm milk                   2 1/2 ts Yeast (one package)
 
  Notes: A true sourdough starter is nothing more than the flour and milk or
  water which sits at room temperature for several days and catches live
  yeast bacteria from the air. Most starter recipes today include yeast as an
  original ingredient as it is much easier and less time consuming. In
  addition, many sourdough bread recipes also indicate usage of yeast itself
  as it does provide a higher rising, lighter loaf.
  
  A sourdough starter should be kept in a glass or plastic bowl which has a
  tight fitting lid. I recommend a bowl instead of a jar as you can "feed"
  your starter right in the bowl easily. To make your starter, mix together:
  
  I mix the starter with an electric, hand held mixer on the lowest setting.
  Cover your starter and place in a warm, draft-free location for 4 to 7
  days, gently stirring it once a day. You may notice that the mixture
  bubbles and in some cases it may even overflow the bowl. This is an
  indication that you have a healthy starter which should simply be poured
  off and discarded.
  
  If your starter ever changes colors, to purple, for example, discard and
  start another one.
  
  After allowing your starter to sit for 4 to 7 days it is ready to be used.
  Take out whatever portion your recipe calls for and put into the machine as
  you would any liquid ingredient. After removing a portion from the starter,
  the starter must be "fed". Simply add equal portions of milk or water and
  flour as was used. For example, if you used 1 cup of starter, replace it
  with 1 cup of water and 1 cup of bread flour.
  
  Some hints on feeding your starter: always use the same kind of flour. If
  you used bread flour in your original starter, use bread flour to feed it.
  Also, alternate between milk and water for each feeding. Since your
  original liquid ingredient was milk, the first liquid feeding should be
  with water. If you forget which you used last, that's okay, but try to
  alternate at least every other time. After feeding your starter, let it sit
  at room temperature for about one day and then refrigerate.
  
  Many cookbooks suggest stirring the starter once a day even when being
  refrigerated; I find that it is not necessary. You must, however, use a
  portion of the starter at least once a week. If you choose not to bake
  sourdough breads that often, then remove a cup of your starter and feed it
  as though you used some during the week. If this is not done, your starter
  will turn rancid and have to be replaced. Should you be away on vacation or
  otherwise not able to tend to the starter, freeze it. Upon your return,
  thaw it in the refrigerator and then remove a portion and feed it as soon
  as you are able.
  
  You may be thinking that this sounds too complicated, but it really is not,
  nor is the starter overly fragile. A friend of mine had the same starter
  for 14 years!
  
  My first few loaves of sourdough were not very sour and I feared it was my
  starter. After allowing the starter to mellow a little by sitting in the
  refrigerator and using only once a week, it and the breads became more
  sour.
  
  Another hint is to put the bread in on the timer cycle for early morning
  baking. The milk put in the night before adds a little more sour taste. If
  the bread is getting too sour for you, feed with water more often than
  milk.

      Title: More Sourdough Starter
 Categories: Breads, Meats
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 c  Water,                            1/2 c  Potato flakes.
      1 c  Sugar, and                     
 
  Now the starters.  This is the starter that Connie used.  After that is an
  alternative for people who have trouble with the first one.
  
  Potato starter I:
  
  Mix the ingredients.  Cover loosely and leave in a warm place, such as on
  top of a water heater, for 3 or 4 days.  If the mixture starts to smell
  yeasty prior to 3 or 4 days, or is ready.  Go ahead and feed it and start
  making bread.  See the feeding directions below.  This is from the "Panola
  COunty Heritage Cookbook".
  
  For people who have trouble cultivating wild yeast, this is an alternate
  starter recipe.
  
  Potato starter II: 2 evelopes (2 TBSP) active dry yeast, 1/2 cup warm water
  (105 to 115 F), 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 F), 2/3 cup sugar, and 3 TBSP
  instant potato flakes.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water in a medium mixing bowl.  Stir in
  1 cup warm water, sugar, and potato flakes.
  
  Let the mixture sit out all day, then refrigerate 10 to 15 days.  (A 10 day
  schedule works fine.)  Remove from refrigerator and feed, see the feeding
  instructions below.  Now you are ready to use 1 cup of the starter to make
  bread.
  
  Return the rest of the starter to the refrigerator for another 5 to 10
  days.  Before making your next batch of bread, feed the starter again.
  
  Now that we have a starter, we need to feed it.
  
  Feeding Recipe: Starter from recipes above, 1 cup water, 3/4 cup sugar, and
  3 TBSP instant potato flakes.
  
  Into starter, stir ingredients well and keep at room temperature for 10 to
  12 hours.
  
  Makes 2 - 3 cups.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 c  Coarsely chopped rhubarb            1    Egg
      1 c  Sugar                               2 tb Milk
  1 1/2 c  Flour                               4 tb Melted butter (1/2 stick)
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder                     1/2 c  Coarsely chopped hickory
    1/2 ts Baking soda                              -nuts
    1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  Let the rhubarb steep in 1/2 cup of the sugar for 1 hour or more (even
  overnight) stirring once or twice.  Toss the remaining sugar and all of the
  dry ingredients together to mix thoroughly.  Beat the egg lightly and stir
  into it 1/4 cup of the juice that the rhubarb will have exuded after
  steeping, as well as the milk and melted butter.  Mix the dry ingredients
  into the wet, stirring just enough to mix.  Fold in the rhubarb (if there
  is still more juice, drain it off) and the nuts. Scrape the batter into a
  buttered 8-inch loaf pan and bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 1 hour. Let
  the loaf rest in the pan 10 minutes before unmolding, then cool it on a
  rack.
  
  Makes one 8-inch loaf.

      Title: Sour Rye with Carraway Seeds
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast                           3 tb Carraway seeds
    1/4 c  Warm water                          1 c  Rye flour
      1 pn Of sugar                            1 c  Gluten (can be purchased in
      1 c  Tepid water                              -GNC stores or other
      2 c  Starter                        
 
  health food places. It makes a difference in texture). Or see "joy of
  Cooking" to make your own gluten.
  
  Mix yeast, 1/4 cup tepid water and pinch sugar. Let dissolve and get
  frothy. Then add all ingredients together, knead dough till smooth. Let
  rise till doubled. Shape into two round loaves and let rise again. Set a
  pan of boiling water 2" deep on the lower shelf. Bake at 425~ for 15
  minutes, then lower temp to 350~ for another 30 minutes. This can also be
  made in a breadmaker. Comes out fine. If you have a smaller machine, halve
  the recipe. I just put all the stuff in the machine, R2D2, hit the button,
  and let it go. Delicious. Freezes well also. Hey guys, try getting a
  machine if you don't have one. Makes breadmaking easy and quick. I could
  have done the job in the time it took to type this.
  
  If someone can't eat food with seeds in it, just toss the carroway seeds
  into a blender or chopper and beat them to a powder and add to mixture
  
  Replace used starter with flour and water used, stir well, let sit out a
  few hours and refrigerate. On and on.

      Title: Sourdough French Bread, San Francisco Style
 Categories: Breads, French
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Hot water                           2 ts Sugar
      1 pk Active dry yeast                    2 ts Salt
      1 c  Sourdough starter                 1/2 ts Soda
      4 c  Unsifted flour                           About 2 cups unsifted flour.
 
  Dissolve yeast in hot water, pour into large mixing bowl and mix with
  starter. Add 4 cups flour, sugar and salt and stir vigorously for 3 or 4
  minutes. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until double in
  bulk (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Mix soda with 1 cup of the remaining flour and
  stir in; the dough will be stiff. Turn dough out onto a floured board and
  begin kneading; add the remaining 1 cup flour or more if necessary to
  control the stickiness. Knead until satiny -- between 5 and 10 minutes.
  
  Shape into oblong loaves or one large round loaf (my preference). Place on
  a lightly greased cooky sheet, cover, and place in a warm place; let rise
  to nearly double in size -- time will depend on warmth of spot -- 1 1/2 to
  2 hours in most kitchens.
  
  Before baking, brush outside with water, make diagonal slashes across the
  top with a sharp single edge razor blade.  Put a shallow pan of hot water
  in the bottom of the oven. Bake in a hot oven -- 400 egrees -- until the
  crust is a medium dark brown (about 45 minutes for oblong loaves and about
  55 minutes for the large round loaf).
  
  For a more sour bread, leave out the yeast and 1/4 c of water but include
  the rest of the warm water, all the starter, 4 cups of flour, sugar and
  salt. Set this sponge after stirring vigorously in the afternoon and allow
  to set over night in a covered bowl. In the morning dissolve the yeast in
  1/4 c of hot water and stir thoroughly into the sponge. Then add your
  additional flour and soda and follow the remainder of the instructions from
  there.

  Mix water yeast and sugar in a bowl and let stand for 1-2 min. Add
  remaining ingredients and knead the dough for 5-10 min. until elastic. When
  making the pizza I have found that a pizza stone works best for maintaining
  a crispy bottom crust. If you don't have a pizza stone try greasing your
  pan and then dust it with corn meal. Bake the crust by itself (no toppings)
  for about 10 min. Then top and finish baking.

      1 pk Dry yeast (about 1 1/2 tsp.)        1 tb Ground cinnamon
      1 c  Milk                              1/2 c  Butter

    1/2 ts Salt                                1 tb Half-and-half or light cream
      3    Eggs                                1    Recipe Powdered Sugar Glaze
    3/4 c  Packed brown sugar                       -(to follow)
 
  "The best part about making this recipe is that the dough can be mixed and
  the rolls filled and shaped the night before.  When you awake in the
  morning, just bake.  Waiting for the rolls to come out of the oven is the
  hardest part"
  
  In a large mixer bowl, combine 2 1/4 cups of the flour and the yeast.
  
  In a small saucepan heat the milk, the 1/3 cup butter, the 1/3 cup sugar,
  and salt just till warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees) and butter is almost
  melted, stirring constantly.  Add to flour mixture.  Add eggs. Beat with an
  electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping sides of bowl
  constantly.  Beat on high speed for 3 minutes.  Using a wooden spoon, stir
  in as much of the remaining 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 cups flour as you can.
  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead in enough of the
  remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and elastic
  (3 to 5 minutes total).  Shape into a ball.  Place in a greased bowl,
  turning once.  Cover; let rise in a warm place till double (about 1 hour).
  
  For filling, combine brown sugar, the 1/4 cup flour, and cinnamon.  Cut in
  remaining butter till crumbly; set aside.
  
  Punch dough down.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface.  Cover and let rest
  for 10 minutes.  Roll the dough into a 12" square.
  
  Sprinkle filling over dough square; top with raisins and pecans.  Roll up
  jelly-roll style; pinch edges to seal.  Slice roll into eight 1 1/2"
  pieces.  Arrange dough pieces, cut side up, in a greased 12" deep-dish
  pizza pan or a 13x9x2" baking pan.
  
  Cover dough loosely with clear plastic wrap, leaving room for rolls to
  rise.  Refrigerate rolls 2 to 24 hours.  Uncover and let stand at room
  temperature for 30 minutes (Or, for immediate baking, don't chill dough.
  Instead, cover loosely; let dough rise in a warm place till nearly double,
  about 45 minutes).
  
  Break any surface bubbles with a greased toothpick.  Brush dough with
  half-and-half or light cream.  Bake in a 375 degree oven for 25 to 30
  minutes or till light brown.  If necessary to prevent overbrowning, cover
  rolls loosely with foil the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking. Remove rolls
  from oven.  Brush again with half-and-half or light cream. Cool for 1
  minute.  Carefully invert cinnamon rolls onto a wire rack. Cool slightly.
  Invert again onto a serving platter.  Drizzle with Powdered Sugar Glaze.
  Serve warm.  Makes 8 rolls.
  
  VARIATION:  Apple Cinnamon Rolls: Prepare rolls as directed, except
  substitute 1 cup finely chopped apple for the raisins in the filling.
  
  POWDERED SUGAR GLAZE:
  
  In a bowl stir together 1 1/4 cups sifted powdered sugar, 1 tsp. corn
  syrup, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and enough half-and-half or light cream (1 to 2
  Tbsp.) to make of drizzling consistency.

      1 c  Wheat bran (optional).              1 pk Active dry yeast.
           You may wish to subsitute:     
 
  This recipe started out as a recipe from James Beard's "Beard on Bread". It
  is the standard and favorite white bread in our house. Most of the changes
  to this bread are minor changes in procedure. I prefer to proof the yeast
  in all of the liquid, He prefered to proof the yeast in 1/2 cup of liquid,
  adding the rest later.  I prefer to use powdered milk, he used fresh milk.
  Are these changes minor or major? Try the bread both ways and you decide.
  The changes were made mostly for the sake of convenience, but I have
  noticed little loss of quality from them.
  
  One of the nice things about this bread is that it serves as an excellent
  base for experimentation.  We have added wheat bran to it, and while it is
  a different bread with the wheat bran in it, it is still a very nice bread.
  We have added small amounts of rye flour to the bread to improve the
  texture.  So, have fun with this recipe. Make it without change while you
  are learning, and have fun with it as you gain experience in baking!
  
  Of the original version of this bread, James Beard says, "To most people
  homemade bread means a slightly sweet loaf made with milk and some
  shortening, quite light and rather fine in texture and much enjoyed when
  fresh with a generous spreading of butter and preserves. It is also popular
  for sandwiches and toast.  Here is such a loaf, which I call 'home-style'
  to distinguish it from my other basic white bread. (2 loaves)"
  
  INGREDIENT LIST
  
  Stir well until the yeast is completely dissolved, and allow the yeast to
  proof.  If you wish, you may use water instead of milk, and then add 2/3
  cup of powdered milk to the first solid ingredients used below. Once the
  yeast has proofed, transfer the yeasty liquid to your main mixing bowl and
  mix in: 1/4 cup melted unsalted butter, and 2 Tbsp salt.
  
  If you used water to proof your yeast in, remember to add the 2/3 cup of
  powdered milk at this point.
  
  You may add 1/3 cup of rye flour at this point.  It will greatly enhance
  the texture of the bread.  You may also add 1 cup of wheat bran at this
  time. While this will darken the bread quite a bit, and, of course, add
  some bran to it, it will not change the taste of the bread very much. Some
  people prefer the taste of the bran'ned bread, others can't tell the
  difference blindfolded.  If you use either of these additions, the amount
  of total white flour will need to be adjusted.
  
  Now add: 4 to 5 cups of white flour one cup at a time, stirring constantly,
  until the dough is rather stiff.
  
  Knead the dough in a mixer, or on a floured board or marble slab. Add more
  white flour as needed as the dough gets sticky, up to 1 or 2 more cups. The
  limit is about 6 cups of total flour.  Continue kneading until the bread is
  supple, satiny, and no longer sticky.
  
  Butter or oil a bowl and place the dough in it, rolling the dough, so as to
  cover the entire surface with butter or oil.  Cover and allow to rise until
  doubled in size, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Punch down the dough, knead the dough for another 4 to 5 minutes. Divide
  into two equal parts, shape into loaves. Place loaves into well-buttered 9"
  x 5" x 3" bread pans, cover, and let rise until again doubled in size.
  Slash the loaves with a sharp knife or a single-edged razor blade. You may
  brush the loaves with lightly beaten egg whites, or water. Bake in a
  pre-heated 400 F oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the bread sounds
  hollow when tapped with the knuckles.
  
  Remove the loaves from their pans, and put them back into the oven for a
  few minutes longer to become crisped.  Note - don't leave them in the oven
  too long for crisping, for crisping can quickly turn into burning!

  Another recipe from James Beard's book, "Beard On Bread". About this bread
  James Beard says, "I learned to make this bread in Norway, at Mrs
  Ovenstad's farm near Oslo.  She bakes it twice a week, and though she
  resorts to heating the dough over steam for the second rising, it comes out
  beautifully. She is also a deft pastry cook and gardner, and loves to eat.
  (2 large Loaves)"
  
  about 1/2 cup at a time.  You may need to add 3 more cups, give or take a
  bit.
  
  Form into a ball, place into a greased bowl, turn and cover. Allow to rise
  until doubled in bulk, probably about 1 hour.
  
  Punch down and knead 10 minutes, then cut into two equal pieces, form
  loaves, and allow to rise again.
  
  You may elect to allow the bread to rise a second time in the bowl. If so,
  James Beard feels that the bread may need some help in the second rising,
  in the form of a bit of heat.  I am not so sure, as this was a very willing
  bread dough.  Then again, I almost always rise my bread in a Microwave oven
  anyway.
  
  As to baking, this bread requires about 1 hour in a 400 F. oven.
  
  This bread should have a good crunchy crust.
  
  I have made this loaf without the wheat berries, as the crust and bread is
  delightful without the berries, and some members of the family refer to
  soft berries as "erasers" and hard berries as "rocks" - refusing to eat
  bread with either.  However, with a bit of practice, you will be able to
  use the wheat berries at the right point so they will be neither "rocks" or
  "erasers".

  crock. (Do not use a metal container.) Cover with a close-fitting lid and
  let the starter rise until light (12 hours in warm weather, longer in cool
  weather). Do not let the starter get cold, ever. After using part of the
  starter, add one cup warm water, two teaspoons sugar, and enough flour to
  mix to the starter's original consistency. Add more potato occasionally as
  food for the yeast, but don't add more yeast. Use daily for best results.
  Starter improves with age.

  Pour melted butter over rolls. In a bowl, mix the remaining ingredients.
  Sprinkle over rolls, cover with plastic and let sit over night or 6-8
  hours...Hint, make sure nuts are not on the outside edges as they will get
  pushed out...I found that mixing the dry ingredients between and around the

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast                           4 c  Flour
      1 c  Warm water                          6 tb Sugar
      2    Eggs beaten                    
 
  Servings: 12
  
  Sugar and cinnamon mix - set aside
  
  Soften yeast in warm water.  Combine all ingredients except the cinnamon
  sugar  mix.  Mix well.  Divide dough into 12 pieces. Let sit 10 minutes.
  Roll out on a lightly floured board. Using hands, stretch each piece into
  circular shape. Heat vegetable oil in 10 skillet (cast iron is best). Place
  each circle of dough in the hot grease.  Turn once - the surface will
  bubble and blister and should be lightly browned.  Turn with spatula and
  broad knife.  Place on absorbent paper toweling. Sprinkle immediately with
  mix of sugar and cinnamon. If you tear a hole in the circle as it is being
  stretched that will not matter.
  
  This will be a favorite for all ages.  The recipe has been around a long
  time, but each time we make them someone has never heard of individuals
  making them.

  20 minutes.  Most chefs feel that a longer cooking time makes the stock
  bitter.
  
  Place all the ingredients in a large heavy kettle and simmer over low heat
  for 20 minutes, skimming if you wish.
  
  Strain through a cheesecloth lined strainer.

  addition to a summer menu.

  "I could never never make a good pie crust. My crusts were always tough or
  crumbly, no matter what recipe I'd try. Whenever we had a family
  get-together and I'd offer to make a pie, my sister or my niece would say,
  "No, Ednie, don't bother. You bring the vegetables, I'll make a pie." But
  since my sister Norm gave me her recipe for a pat-in pie crust, I've had
  incredible success! Every time! The family no longer reject my offerings.
  My crust are crisp and tasty and golden. The edges may not be perfectly
  fluted like Norm's are but that's not important. Pat-in crust is so easy to
  make. I put all the ingredients into my food processor, give them a brief
  whirl, and pour the mixture into a pie plate. I pat it firmly ~ around the
  edges first, then through the middle - and that's it. No rolling or wasting
  bits of pastry, and so fast that it can be done in five minutes.
   Norm doesn't mix her crust in her food processor. She let her husband,
  Ralph, blend the ingredients with a fork in the pie plate. Then he can
  proudly say he made it..."
  
    Sift flour, sugar and salt directly in 9-10" pie plate. Combine oil and
  milk in measuring cup and beat with fork till creamy. Pour all at once over
  flour in pie plate; give your food processor a brief whirl or -in a pie
  plate mix with a fork till flour is completely dampened. Push the dough
  with your fingers to line bottom and sides of pan, then fill with whatever
  filling you've chosen.
  
  If you are making a baked pie shell to be filled later, prick the pastry
  with a fork to keep it from bubbling. Bake at 425F for 15 minutes or until
  golden. Fill If you're fussy, press it down with a pie plate. Flute the
  edges.
  
  Source: Edna Staebler's Schmecks cookbooks NB: To extend a pie to serve
  more than 6 or 8, then pat the pastry into a 9" X 13" cake pan, spread the
  filling over it and when baked, cut into 12 squares. posted by Anne

      4 tb Tomato paste                        4 lg Eggs
 
  In  oil  saute  onion,  green pepper and garlic. While they soften, stir in
  tomatoes and their juice (break the  tomatoes  up  a  bit), tomato paste,
  basil,  oregano,  rosemary,  bay  leaf and honey. Simmer sauce for about 10
  minutes, then make indentations in it with a spoon and break into it 4-6
  eggs.  Spoon sauce around and cover them, pop on a cover, and let the whole
  thing simmer gently until the eggs are poached; the whites should be medium
  firm, the yolks still runny. Lift each egg out with a spatula onto a
  serving plate in which you've placed a bed of cooked spaghetti or a thick
  slice of toasted french bread or a bed of hot, steaming rice, or a tortilla
  if you want it Mexican-style. Spoon extra sauce around each egg and
  sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese. From: Dairy Hollow House Cookbook

-----------------------------SEA FOAM FROSTING-----------------------------
      2    Egg whites                        1/3 c  COCA-COLA
  1 1/2 c  (firmly packed) light               1 ts Vanilla extract

    1/8 ts Cream of tartar *              
 
  *  Do not use a mix with pudding added or which requires oil.
  
  *  you may substitute 1 tablespoon corn syrup.
  
  TO MAKE THE CAKE:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the cake mix, baking
  soda, and eggs.  Measure the Coca-Cola, stir briskly until the foaming
  stops; add to the batter.  Blend ingredients just until moistened, then
  beat at high speed of an electric mixer for 3 minutes, scraping the bowl
  often.
  
  In a bowl, combine the mashed bananas with the lemon juice; add to the
  batter.  Add the chopped nuts to the batter and beat for 1 minute at medium
  speed.  Turn the batter into a well-greased, lightly floured, 13x9x2-inch
  pan.
  
  Bake in a preheated, 350 degree F oven for about 40 minutes or until the
  cake tests done.  Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, remove cake from pan and
  turn right-side up on a rack to finish cooling.
  
  TO MAKE THE SEA FOAM FROSTING:  In the top of a double boiler, combine all
  the ingredients except the vanilla extract.  Beat 1 minute at high speed of
  an electric mixer.  Place over boiling water (the water should not touch
  the bottom of the top half of the double boiler.). Beat on high speed about
  7 minutes until the frosting forms peaks when the mixer is raised.
  
  Remove from boiling water (for the smoothest frosting, empty into a large
  bowl).  Add the vanilla extract and continue beating on high speed until
  thick enough to spread, about 2 minutes.  Spread on the sides and top of
  the cold banana cake.

  This cake is remarkable; no one would ever believe that it is so low in fat
  and calories. Depending on the sweetness of the fruit you use to garnish
  the cake, you may wish to increase or decrease the sugar in the lemon
  syrup. (By Times Food Stylists) Combine nonfat milk and poppy seeds in a
  bowl. Let stand about 15 minutes. Stir in pear puree, egg white, vanilla
  and lemon zest. Sift together cake flour, 3/4 cup sugar and baking powder
  in another bowl. Stir nonfat milk mixture just until blended. Pour into
  9-inch indented, fluted shortcake pan sprayed with non-stick vegetable
  spray. Bake at 375 degrees F. about 20 minutes or until cake tests done in
  the center. Let cool in pan 5 minutes. Loosen edges and turn out onto wire
  rack with wax paper underneath. Combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and lemon
  juice in small sauce pan. Heat to boiling. Simmer about 1 minute or until
  syrup is clear. Brush syrup over top and sides of cake while cake is still
  warm. Place cake on serving platter. Arrange raspberries, kiwi wedges and
  papaya balls in attractive arrangement on top of cake. Garnish center with
  lemon rose and severl lemon leaves, if available. Each serving contains

      2    Egg whites                     
 
  Raisin Puree is the basis for the dough of this rich-tasting, chewy bar.
  The combination of orange and chocolate is a classic favorite. We
  considered cutting the amount of chocolate in the recipe, thereby cut- ting
  the fat, but in the end we agreed that the extra richness is worth the
  extra grams of fat. (By Times Food Stylists) Sift together flour, baking
  powder and salt into large bowl. Stir in oats and brown sugar. Beat egg
  whites lightly in another bowl. Stir in Raisin Puree. Stir into flour
  mixture along with chocolate, walnuts, and orange zest just until blended.

      Title: Anise Meringue Kisses
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 48 servings
 
      3    Egg whites                        1/2 c  Sugar
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar                 1 1/2 ts Ground anise seeds
 
  The flavor of anise in these light cookies makes them a great after- dinner
  dessert. Some people prefer the center to be soft and chewy, but if you
  prefer the dry melt-in-your-mouth type of meringue, turn off the oven and,
  with the door closed, let them stand 30 minutes to an hour. These cookies
  are generally baked on parchment paper, but we have found that regular bond
  paper makes a very acceptable substitute. (By Times Food Stylists) Beat egg
  whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks. Gradually
  beat in sugar. Continue beating until stiff and glossy. Beat in anise.
  Using pastry bag, pipe onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake at 275
  degrees F. 30 minutes. Makes about 4 dozen kisses. NOTE: If drier meringue
  is desired, turn off oven and let kisses stand in oven with door closed
  about 1 hour. Each kiss contains about: 9 calories; 4 mg sodium; 0

    1/4 c  Cake flour                          1 tb Canola oil
 
  2-2 1/2 tb very cold water The low-calorie rice pudding flan is so
  delicious by itself that you may want to save the calories and fat in the
  crust, and serve it without the pastry. Bring nonfat milk to boil in medium
  saucepan. Add vanilla bean and rice. Cover partially and simmer until rice
  is almost tender, about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in
  sugar and continue and continue cooking 3 minutes. Remove from heat and
  cool slightly. Remove vanilla bean. Blend egg substitute with ricotta
  cheese. Stir into rice mixture with candied ginger. Carefully pour into
  prepared pastry shell, filling almost to the top (if there is any flan
  mixture left from incomplete reduction in cooking, place in small custard
  dish, cover and microwave 40 to 60 seconds or until set.) Sprinkle with 1/4
  teaspoon cinnamon. Bake at 400 degrees F. 25 to 30 minutes or until set.
  Remove from oven. Sift powdered sugar over and sprinkle with remaining
  cinnamon. Serve warm and garnish with sliced ginger if desired. Makes 12
  servings. Each serving contains about: 183 calories; 102 mg sodium; 11 mg
  cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 31 grams carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 0.25
  gram fiber. The use of oat flour blend and cake flour is what gives this
  low-fat crust its tenderness. It also makes it more difficult to roll, but
  don't despair: The dough is easily patched. Low-Fat Sweet Pastry Sift
  flour, cardamom and sugar into large bowl. Rub in butter with fingers or
  cut in with pastry blender until size of small peas. Using fork, stir in
  oil. Slowly add cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time, tossing with fork until
  flour is moistened without being wet. Gather dough with moist hands, shape
  into flattened round and let rest about 15 minutes. Roll 1/8-inch thick on
  lightly floures board. (To facilitate rolling, dough may also be rolled
  between sheets of wax paper Or unrolled dough may be placed in pan and
  gently pressed  to cover inside of pan.) Gently lift and press onto 9-inch
  square tart pan with removable bottom. Cut off dough edges. Bake at 425
  degrees F. 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Makes 12 servings. NOTE:
  Unsalted butter will give a more delicate fresh flavor in this pastry. Add
  a dash of salt if using.

      1 lg Egg yolk beaten with           
 
  In a roasting pan, roast the beef in the middle of a preheated 400f oven
  for 25-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 120f. Let the
  fillet cool completely and discard the larding fat and strings. Skim the
  fat from the pan juices and reserve the juices. In a heavy skillet, cook
  the mushrooms in butter over mod-low heat, stirring, until all liquid they
  give off is evaporated and the mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper
  and let cool completely. Spread the fillet evenly with foie gras, covering
  the top and sides, and spread the mushrooms evenly over the foie gras. On a
  floured surface, roll one lb. of puff pastry into a rectangle about 20x12
  inches, or large enough to enclose the roast completely. Invert the fillet
  in the middle of the pastry and fold up the long sides to enclose it,
  brushing the edges of the dough with some egg white to seal them. Fold the
  ends of the dough over the fillet and seal with the egg white. Transfer the
  fillet, seam side down, to a jelly-roll pan and brush the dough with egg
  wash.  Roll out additional dough and cut out shapes with which to decorate
  the dough. After applying, brush with egg wash. Chill for at least 1 hour
  and up to 2 hours. Bake the fillet in the middle of a preheated 400f oven
  for 30 minutes.
   Reduce heat to 350f and bake an additional 5-10 minutes more or until a
  meat thermometer registers 130f for medium rare meat and the pastry is
  cooked through.  Let stand for 15 minutes. In a saucepan, boil the reserved
  pan juices and the Madeira until the mixture is reduced by one fourth. Add
  the arrowroot mixture, broth, truffles, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook
  the sauce over moderate heat, stirring, for 5 minutes or until thickened,
  being careful not to let it boil. Loosen the fillet from the pan,
  transfering it to a heated platter. Garnish with watercress. Serve the
  fillet cut into 3/4-inch thick slices, with the sauce. a 1966 Gourmet Mag.

  necessary, chill the buttercream, covered, until it is firm enough to
  spread.
  
  Ganache:     In a large heavy saucepan, bring cream just to a boil and
  remove from heat.  Add chocolate and stir until it is smooth. Transfer
  mixture to a bowl and chill, covered, stirring occasionally, until it is
  cool and thickened.  Do not let it solidify.  Beat the mixture until it
  just forms soft peaks, but do not overbeat.
  
  Assembly:        Force preserves through a fine sieve into a bowl. Transfer
  the cake layers to a work surface. Trim edges and halve each layer
  lengthwise.  On a serving plate, arrange one layer, spread with a third of
  the preserves, and spread a third of the ganache over the preserves. Top
  with another layer and proceed with the preserves, ganache and cake in the
  same manner, ending with a cake layer on top. Spread the sides and top of
  the cake with a thin layer of buttercream an chill for 30 minutes. Spread
  on additional buttercream, leaving about 1/3 cup to make rosettes. With a
  pastry comb or tines of a fork, score the buttercream lengthwise. Draw the
  back of a knife crosswise across the scored buttercream at intervals.
  Transfer the remaining buttercream to a small pastry bag fitted with a
  decorative tip. Pipe rosettes on top of the torte along the long sides and
  intersperse the rosettes with chocolate coffee beans. Chill.
  
  Remove from refrigerator about 30 minutes before serving.

           Nectarine mousse:                        Peach syrup:
  1 1/2 lb Nectarines                        1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Sugar                             1/3 c  Peach schnapps
      5 ts Unflavored gelatin                       Peach glaze:
    1/4 c  Lemon juice                     1 1/4 ts Unflavored gelatin
    1/4 c  Peach schnapps                    3/4 c  Peach preserves or jam
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream, well chilled           3 tb Peach schnapps
           Genoise cake (see recipe)      
 
  Halve, pit, and chop nectarines and, in a heavy saucepan, combine them with
  sugar and 1/2 cup water.  Bring to a boil, stirring, and cook it at a slow
  boil, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.  In a food processor, puree
  the mixture and force it through a fine sieve into a large bowl, pressing
  hard on the solids.
  
  In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over the lemon juice and schnapps,
  let it soften for 5 minutes, then heat mixture over low heat, stirring,
  until gelatin has dissolved.  Stir gelatin into nectarine puree, blending
  the mixture well.  Let it cool to room temperature.
  
  In a chilled bowl, beat the cream until it holds soft shapes, (not as stiff
  as soft peaks) and fold it into the nectarine mixture.
  
  Trim the Genoise and cut it into three layers, horizonally.
  
  Peach Syrup:    In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water.
  Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and stir in the
  schnapps.  Let the syrup cool to room temperature. Assembly: Center one
  layer in the bottom of a 9-1/2-inch springform pan and brush with half the
  peach syrup.  Pour half the mousse over the cake and top it with another
  layer of Genoise.  Brush with the remaining peach syrup and pour the
  remaining mousse over the cake, rapping on the side of the pan to expel any
  air bubbles and smoothing the surface. Chill for 2 hours, or until it is
  set.
  
  Peach Glaze:    In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over 3 Tbsp cold water
  and let it soften for 5 minutes.  In a small saucepan, combine the
  preserves and schnapps, bring mixture to a boil, stirring, and simmer it
  for 1 minute.  Remove pan from heat, add gelatin mixture, stirring until
  gelatin is dissolved, and strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a
  bowl, pressing hard on the solids.
  
  Assembly:      Pour all but about 2 Tbsp of Peach Glaze over top of the
  mousse cake, covering it completely, and chill the cake for 2 hours, or
  until glaze is set.
  
  While cake is chilling, in a food processor, grind the remaining Genoise
  layer into fine crumbs.  Toast the crumbs in a jelly-roll pan in a
  preheated 350f oven for 5-8 minutes or until they are golden. Reserve.
  
  Cut half the nectarine into thin slices, and arrange them decoratively on
  top of the cake in a pinwheel pattern.  Brush the remaining glaze over the
  nectarine slices and chill the cake, covered, for 1 hour, or until the
  newly applied glaze is set.
  
  Run a thin knife around the edge of the pan and remove the side of the pan.
  Working over a sheet of wax paper, coat sides of cake with the cake crumbs.
  
  Let cake stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving.

  fine sieve into a small bowl. Keeping the ducks chilled, brush them with
  some of the marinade, every 30 minutes, for 2-1/2 hours. Let the ducks dry
  at room temperature for 30 minutes. Stuff each duck with one of the bread
  slices, 1 scallion and 1 parsley sprig. Spoon remaining marinade into the

  the beer into the roasting pan. Roast the ducks on the rack in the lower
  third of a preheated 350f oven for 30 minutes. Tent birds with foil and
  roast for 30 minutes more. Discard foil and roast for another 30 minutes or
  until a meat thermometer registers 180f. (The skin should be very mahogany
  colored and crisp.) Remove stuffing ingredients with a spoon and discard
  them and the pan juices. Pour the juices from the cavities through a fine
  sieve into a small bowl. Skim the fat, and reserve 1/4 cup of the juices.
  Arrange ducks on a platter and keep them warm, covered loosely. In a
  saucepan, bring the stock to a boil, simmer it for 15 minutes, and stir in
  reserved juices.  Bring the mixture to a simmer.  Stir arrowroot mixture
  and add to pan.  Cook the mixture over mod-low heat, being careful not to
  boil, until thickened.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the sauce to

  tender.  Transfer the veal to an ovenproof serving dish with a slotted
  spoon.  Discard the strings and keep the shanks warm. Strain pan juices
  into a saucepan, pressing hard on the solids.  Skim off the fat. Boil for
  about 15 minutes or until reduced to about 3 cups. Baste the shanks in some
  of the reduced juices, and bake them, basting 3-4 more times, for 10
  minutes or until the shanks are glazed. In a bowl, stir together the
  parsley, zest, and garlic.  Sprinkle the shanks with the gremolata and pour

           Custard:                            2 tb Pistachio nuts, shelled and
      7 lg Egg yolks                                -hopped
      1 c  Sugar                                    Candied citron or angelica,
      2 c  Milk, scalded & cooled                   -ut into bits
    1/2 c  Heavy cream, scalded & coole             Raspberry jam, seedless
 
  In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla,
  until the mixture is thick and pale.  Sift the flour and baking powder over
  the egg mixture and fold them into it gently but thoroughly. Line the
  bottom of a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with parchment paper, spread the batter
  in the pan and bake in a preheated 400f oven for 8 minutes or until it is
  puffed and golden.  Invert onto a lightly sugared kitchen towel.
  
  In a small saucepan, melt the jam over low heat.  Stir in kirsch and spread
  the surface of the cake with the jam mixture.  Starting with a long side
  and using the towel as a guide, roll up the cake, jelly-roll fashion and
  sprinkle it with Sherry.  Wrap the sponge roll firmly in the towel. Let it
  cool and cut int into 3/4-inch slices.
  
  In a bowl, set over a saucepan of simmering water, beat the yolks and the
  sugar with an electric mixer until the mixture is thick and pale. Remove
  from heat and stir in gradually, milk, cream, and vanilla. Cook the custard
  in the bowl over the simmering water, until it registers 170f on a candy
  thermometer.  Transfer the custard to a metal bowl and whisk in the creme
  fraiche and Sherry.  Set the bowl in a larger bowl of ice water and whisk
  until custard is cool.  Chill it, covering surface with plastic wrap, until
  it is cold.
  
  Assembly:     In the bottom of a 2-1/2-qt. trifle bowl, scatter half the
  amaretti crumbs.  Top them with half the sponge roll slices, and top those
  with the remaining amaretti crumbs.  Sprinkle the Sherry over the remaining
  sponge roll slices, line the side of the bowl with the slices, and pour in
  the custard, spreading it to let it seep down around the sided and bottom.
  Chill the trifle for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.
  
  Just before serving, in a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream until
  it is stiff.  Transfer it to a pastry bag, fitted with a decorative tip and
  pipe rosettes around the edge and in the center of the trifle. Sprinkle
  pistachios over the trifle and garnish the rosettes with the citron and
  small drops of jam.

  garlic, sherry, cayenne pepper, and the peppercorns. Mix all ingredients
  very well. Toss the chicken strips in this sauce, to coat. Refrigerate
  until 20 minutes before serving. Pass the chicken and the lettuce leaves
  separately, and let each guest place a small portion of the chicken in the
  middle of a lettuce leaf and roll it up like an egg roll to eat using
  fingers.  Makes 6 appetizer servings.
  
  NOTE:  The authentic recipe calls for green tea to thin the sesame seed
  paste,
       but you may substitute chicken broth, or simply water, if you prefer.
       Another substitution you may make if you wish is peanut butter for the
       sesame seed paste along with sesame oil instead of green tea.
       This dish is served cold or at room temperature and can be made a day
       ahead . -- Verdi

           Fat and discard the           

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      4 tb Chicken broth                       1 ts Sugar
    1/4 c  Soy sauce                           2 cl (medium) garlic,
      3 tb Honey or corn syrup                      Chopped fine
      3 tb Hoisin sauce                      1/2 ts Cinnamon
      2 tb Wine vinegar                          pn (tiny) 5-spice powder
      2 tb Dry sherry or                            (optional)
           Shaoshing wine                

-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
           Plum sauce                               Scallion, chopped
 
  Preheat the oven 10 375 degree F. Trim any excess fat from the ribs and
  place them in a long shallow dish. In a mixing bowl, combine the marinade
  ingredients; if you are using 5-spice powder, add it to the mixture by
  putting it through a tea strainer so it spreads out over the mixture. Mix
  well, and pour over the ribs and leave for 3 hours at room temperature or
  about 6 hours in the refrigerator.  Baste the ribs every hours or so,
  turning them over. TO ROAST THE RIBS: Remove the ribs from the marinade.
  Add the 1/4 cup plum sauce to the marinade; reserve it for basting. Hook
  metal drapery hooks through both ends of each rack of ribs, at the top, and
  hang each one as if you were hanging a hammock, suspended from the bars of
  one of the oven racks.  Set the oven rack in the highest position in the
  oven. On the floor of the oven or on another oven rack set at the lowest
  position in the oven, place a baking pan half filled with water, to collect
  drippings and prevent smoking. You may want to line the baking pan with
  aluminum foil before putting the water in, to make it easier to clean.
  Roast the spareribs for 45 minutes in the preheated oven.  Then baste them
  with the reserved basting sauce, using a small pastery brush and carefully
  pulling out the oven rack to facilitate the basting process. Turn the oven
  up to 450 degrees F and roast for another 15 minutes.  By this time the
  spareribs should be a rich golden brown with crisp edges.  Baste again,
  then take them out of the oven.  Place the ribs on a cutting board and
  remove the drapery hooks.  Separate the individual ribs with a cleaver or
  sharp knife.  Serve at room temperature, with dipping sauce.  Makes 6 to 8
  appetizer servings. NOTE: You will need about 12 drapery hooks. Recipe:

      Title: Cold Lemon Chicken with "Fragrant Green"
 Categories: Poultry, Appetizers, Chinese
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 md Onion                                    Lettuce leaves
      1 lb (whole) chicken beast               4 tb Cilantro leaves and stem,
      6    Celery leaves                            Finely chopped
      4 tb Chinese lemon sauce                 1    Lemon's juice
  1 1/2 tb Dark soy sauce                 
 
  In a saucepan, put the onion, chicken breast, and celery leaves with just
  enough water to cover.  Bring to a slow boil; cover and simmer over medium
  heat for 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow the chicken to cool in
  the liquid.  When it is cool, skin and boned the chicken and slice it.
  Marinate the chicken slices and a mixture of lemon sauce and soy sauce for
  45 minutes. On a serving dish, arrange the chicken slices on a bed of
  lettuce leaves; sprinkle with the chopped cilantro. Sprinkle the lemon
  juice over the chicken slices. Your guests can put some of the sliced
  chicken in the middle of a lettuce leaf and roll it up like an egg roll
  before eating.  Makes 8 to 10 appetizer servings.
  
  NOTE:  Cilantro, also called Chinese parsley, fresh coriander, and
  "fragrant
       green," gives the Szechuan dish its distinctive flavor. -- Verdi

      Title: Parchment-Wrapped Chicken
 Categories: Poultry, Appetizers, Chinese
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      4    Scallions, green tops only          1 ts Sugar
      2    Whole chicken beast                 2 ts Oil
      1 ts Ginger juice (see below)           24    Squares (6-in) parchment
      2 ts Dry sherry or                            (see NOTE)
           Shaoshing wine                      2 c  Oil, for deep-frying
      2 ts Light soy sauce                          Hoisin sauce, for dipping
      1 ts Salt                           
 
  Shred the scallions lengthwise and then cut into 1-1/2 inch lengths.  Cut
  the chicken breasts into strips 1/4 inch wide by 1-1/2 inches in length.
  Squeeze enough fresh ginger in a garlic press to render 1 teaspoon of
  ginger juice. In a bowl, combine the ginger juice with the sherry/wine,
  scallion strips, soy sauce, salt and sugar, to make a marinade for the
  chicken strips.  Let the chicken marinate for at least 10 minutes. Place a
  square of parchment in front of you, with a corner toward you. Rub a bit of
  oil o the center of the paper.  Place a little of the chicken and a bit of
  the scallion on the paper horizontally, well below the center of the angled
  square.  Fold the lower corner up to cover the meat, then fold the left
  corner over to the right and the right corner over to left, to make a small
  envelope. Fold the top corner down and tuck it in securely. Repeat the
  process for the other 23 pieces of paper, using the rest of the chicken and
  scallions. In wok or deep fryer, heat the oil to 375 degrees F. Deep fry
  the envelopes in the hot oil for 1 minute on each side. Remove with a
  slotted spoon or a strainer, and drain on paper towels. Serve with hoisin
  sauce. NOTE: Deep-frying foods in a wrapping of paper is a Chinese trick.
  The paper
       acts like a batter coating, to protect and insulate the ingredient
       against the hot oil.
       Use cooking parchment or rice paper; other suitable papers are
       available in cooking-supply houses.  The paper must be porous; never
       use aluminum foil or plastic cling wrap. -- Verdi

  more butter to the pan and cook beef, stirring occasionally, until it is
  browned and heated through. Add beef to container with onions and potatoes;
  keep warm. Again using the same frying pan add broth, Worcestershire, salt,
  and pepper. Cook over high heat until reduced by about half; then pour over
  hash mixture. Mix lightly but thoroughly. Using the same pan, melt 1 to 2
  tablespoons butter and fry eggs until done as desired. Spoon hash onto a
  warm platter and arrange eggs on top. Garnish with the lettuce and
  tomatoes. Serve with coarse salt, if you wish. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
  
  Biksemad (bick-sa-mod) is the Danish name of this delicious beef and
  potatoe hash. It makes a delightful entree for a casual supper or brunch.

      1 tb Dry sherry                               (for garnish)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 c  (about 1/2 lb) ground pork,         2 ts Cornstarch, dissolved in
           Uncooked                            2 tb Water, cold
      2 md Fresh mushrooms,                  1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
           Chopped fine                        1 tb Dry sherry
      2    Scallions, chopped fine             1 ts Salt
           (white parts separate from          1 tb Peanut oil
           The green)                    

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      2 tb Oyster sauce                             Dash hot chili oil or
      1 tb Light soy sauce                          Tabasco
      1 tb Plum sauce                               Sauce
 
  In a bowl, stir the eggs with the dry sherry. In a mixing bowl, combine all
  the filling ingredients, include only the white parts of the chopped
  scallions (save the green parts for garnish) and stir to blend well. In a
  8-inch skillet, heat the oil lightly.  Pour about a quarter of the egg
  mixture to cover the bottom of the skillet.  Heat until the egg pancake has
  barely set, then transfer to a plate.  Make 3 more pancakes. Divide the
  filling into 4 portions and put a portions on each pancake. Moisten your
  fingers with cold water and spread the filling mixture evenly over the
  surface of the pancake, then roll up tightly, as you would a jelly roll.
  Seal with a little leftover egg from the egg-beating bowl.  Place the rolls
  on a flat plate that will fit your steamer, and then steam them over an
  inch of simmering water for 15 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the sauce
  ingredients.  To serve, cut the rolls into slices, cutting on the slant.
  Drizzle the sauce over them and top with the scallion greens and the
  carrots.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

           Salt chicken stock             
 
  Saute onions, carrots and celery in large pot with oil. Saute until
  translucent, then carmelized (turns light brown. Add chopped vegetables,
  water to cover vegetables. Add chicken packets, stir in thyme, and pepper
  and bring to boil. Lower heat and simmer for 30-45 minutes.
  
  Place in blender a cup or so at a time. Puree each batch and empty into
  large bowl. Rinse pot, replace soup mixture and again bring to simmer again
  for a few minutes, stirring occassionally.
  
  Note: At this stage, we allow the mixture to sit until it cools slightly
  and divide the soup into 3 equal portions. The soup freeezs excellently and
  we do that with 2 of the portions.
  
  Variations: Place the basic soup into a pot. Simmer and bring to a boil.
  Add a quarter cup of milk either regular or skimmed) and bring to boil
  again.  To add texture to the mix, add diced potatoes and carrots. *Serve
  with a pinch of dried tarragon*. A a dollop of no fat yogurt adds
  additional smoothness.
  
  If desired, substitute 1/2 cup of cooked fucilli instead of the potato. You
  may also substitute frozen corn or peas.

      Title: Thousand-Year-Old Eggs
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Chinese
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 c  Very strong black tea                    From fireplace
    1/3 c  Salt                                1 c  Lime*
      2 c  Each ashes of pine wood,           12    Fresh duck eggs
           Ashes of charcoal and ashes    
 
      These are often called thousand-year eggs, even though the preserving
  process lasts only 100 days. They may be purchased individually in Oriental
  markets.
  
      Combine tea, salt, ashes and lime. Using about 1/2 cup per egg, thickly
  coat each egg completely with this clay-like mix- ture. Line a large crock
  with garden soil and carefully lay coated eggs on top. Cover with more soil
  and place crock in a cool dark place. Allow to cure for 100 days. To remove
  coating, scrape eggs and rinse under running water to clean thoroughly.
   Crack lightly and remove shells. The white of the egg will appear a
  grayish, translucent color and have a gelatinous texture. The yolk, when
  sliced, will be a grayish-green color.
  
      To serve, cut into wedges and serve with:
  
      Sweet pickled scallions or any sweet pickled vegetable
  
      Sauce of 2 tablespoons each vinegar, soy sauce and rice wine and 1
  tablespoon minced ginger root.
  
      *Available in garden stores and nurseries.
  
      The description of the whites turning grayish isn't quite accurate from
  the ones I've seen. They're more a dark blackish amber color-- quite
  attractive actually.

      Title: Succulent Salmon  (C) 1992 George Gilder
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 2 servings
 
     10 oz Salmon fillet                            Broccoli, cut into florets
           (remove the skin)                   1 tb Olive oil
      2 md Red potatoes                      1/4 ts Thyme
      1 lg Onions, sliced 1/4 inch           1/2 ts Basil
      8    Baby carrots or 8 carrot            1 pk Herb-ox low salt
           Sections, cut into 2"                    Chicken stock mix
           Pieces                                   Salt, pepper,to taste
    1/4 c  Fresh orange juice             
 
  This is a new adaptation from a series of fish recipes I developed for
  "people who don't like fish". The stock and juice combined with the onion
  add a distinctive savory flavor. The combination makes it hard to
  distinguish the individual flavors. This dinner takes less than ten minutes
  to complete.
  
  Cut the potatoes into one quarter inch slices and place into a pan of cold
  water. Turn pot on high until it starts to boil. Add the carrots after
  three minutes. Salt the water and reduce heat to medium. Cook until tender,
  about six to seven minutes. Add broccoli about 2 minutes before the
  potatoes are finished. Drain if finished before the fish, and place back in
  hot pan. Add fresh pepper.
  
  Saute onions in one half the oil, med-low heat in a ten inch teflon pan.
  When they start to brown add the rest of oil. Place the fish fillet on top
  fat side down and turn up heat to med- high. Saute until salmon turns white
  on bottom. Add herbs and pepper. Add one quarter cup of water, chicken
  stock and the orange juice. Lower heat and simmer about five minutes. Baste
  occasionally. The salmon should be pink inside and not over done.
  
  Cut the filet in half in the pan. Using a plastic spatula, pick up the fish
  and onions and place in one half of plate. Add a spoon or two of sauce. Add
  vegetables and arrange in semi-circle.

      Title: Tomato Sauce
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lg Can tomatoes (cheapest is                (optional - only if you
           Best here, since they're                 Like it)
           Soupy to start with)              1/4 c  Best olive oil
      2    Dead-ripe, peeled, fresh            8 oz Contadina tomato sauce
           Tomatoes (optional - if             6 oz Can Contadina tomato paste
           They're in season, else           1/2 ts Salt
           Don't bother)                     1/4 ts Dried oregano
      1    Onion, chopped                           Minced fresh basil, to
      2 cl Garlic, minced                           Taste (hard to have too
      1 sm Bell pepper, red or green                Much basil)
 
  Heat the olive oil in a large pot, and saute the onions and green pepper
  until soft.  Add the garlic and saute another minute or two.  Coarsely chop
  the fresh tomatoes, add them to the pot and cook, stirring, until they
  begin to give up their juice.  Coarsely chop the canned tomatoes and add
  them, along with the tomato sauce and tomato past.  Stir in the seasonings,
  cover the pot and simmer the sauce over low heat 20 to 30 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  The Contadina tomato sauce and paste have significantly better flavor than
  any others I know of.  If you can't get Contadina, then a small shake of
  tobasco will help (not enough to make it hot, just enough to give it a
  little sparkle).
  
  For all those people who THINK they can't make a pie crust, here is a
  quick, easy, and CHEAP pie crust recipe.  I think the trick is the boiling
  water and fluffing the shortening with a fork so that it disperses evenly
  throughout the flour.

      Title: Never-Fail Pie Crust
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Crisco or other GOOD                     Pinch of salt
           Shortening                          3 c  Flour.
    1/2 c  Boiling water                  
 
  Mix shortening, salt and boiling water in a large bowl. Whip with a fork
  until fluffy.  Add the flour all at once.  Stir until it leaves the side of
  the bowl.  Roll between two sheets of wax paper.  Makes enough for a
  two-crust pie.  If using for two one-crust pies, bake at 375 10-12 minutes
  or until light brown before adding filling.
  
  This also freezes well if made up ahead, if you like to have pie shells on
  hand for one-crust pies.

      Title: Hopping John
 Categories: Rice/grains, Pork/ham
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      4    Strips bacon                        2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Raw rice                            2 c  Fresh Blackeye Peas
    1/4 c  Onion                                    Salt & Pepper to taste
 
  Dice bacon. Add onion and fry until bacon is crisp.  Add peas and rice,
  then water.  Cover and simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes or until
  rice is tender.  ( I *ALWAYS* add a good sized shake or two of Louisiana
  Hot sauce (NOT Tabasco, there is a difference) Yields 10 servings
  
  This is the basic recipe (from Southern Living)  It can be adjusted in
  several ways:
  
  1)  substitute ham hocks for bacon by boiling them in the 2 C water until
  the meat comes off the bone.  Fry onion in bacon grease until yellow. Or
  use any fatty pork meat: trimmings from a roast or chops, "fat-back", etc
  
  2)  I prefer Purple-Hull Peas over the Black-eyes, But if you don't know
  the difference (or can't find them)  it's not a big deal.  It is important
  to use fresh peas, frozen if you have to...if you can only get canned or
  dried peas, nevermind and fix something else.
  
  3)  I discovered a secret to Southern style cooking: Cavender's Greek
  Seasoning.  Put a little of it in everything, along with the Louisiana Hot
  Sauce makes everything taste better.  This is what I would do for the
  greens as a regular family dinner.  Later I'll get out the company recipe.
  
  BTW  Southern Living is *the* Soutern magazine and has the best recipes for
  regional favorites.  They also put out an annual cookbook which includes
  all the recipes for the year.  If I keep osting them here y'all see that
  this book is a very worthwhile purchase.

      Title: Post Oak Delight
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 12 servings
 
     16 oz Chocolate wafers                    1 qt Raspberry ice (sorbet)
     10 tb Unsalted butter, melted                  Fudge Sauce (see below)

  the reserved crumb mixture.  Dribble half the fudge sauce over the crumb
  layer, then place in the freezer so the yogurt won't melt.
  
  After 5 minutes, make a second layer with the raspberry ice.  Sprinkle the
  remaining crumb mixture on top.  Put in freezer immediantly.
  
  Serve with the remaining fudge sauce and whipped cream, if desired.

      3    Egg whites                     
 
  Pit and pure enough sour cherries to make 3/4 cup.  (My guess is that
  something over 1 cup whole cherries will be required.)  Preheat the oven to
  375F.  Oil a 1-quart souffl dish and sprinkle it with sugar. Heat the
  cherry pure in a small pan.  Add the lemon juice, salt, and sugar to
  taste, and stir to blend; remove from the heat.  Beat the egg whites until
  stiff but not dry and stir them into the hot pure until evenly blended.
  Spoon into the souffl dish and bake for 20-25 minutes.

      Title: Yum Pra-Hmik (Thai Squid "Salad").
 Categories: Appetizers, Fish/sea, Thai
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh Squids.                       1 tb Fresh Ginger Root, Julienne.
      1 tb Lemongrass, Sliced Fine.            2 tb Onion, Chopped.
      3 tb Lime or Lemon Juice.                3 tb Fish Sauce.
      1 tb Scallions, Chopped.                 1 tb Cilantro, Chopped.
    1/2 c  Mint Leaves.                       10    Crushed Hot Chili Peppers.
 
  Clean and wash the fresh squids, removing all inner matters and skin.  Cut
  through the side so that the meat is in a single "sheet".  Cut the meat
  into strips about 3/4" to 1" wide and 2" long.  If desired, slash one side
  in a close criss-cross patterns, and the strip will curl into a roll upon
  cooking.  Place the squid pieces into a wire strainer with long handle.
  
  Boil a pot of water, and immerse the strainer with the squid meat into the
  boiling water to cook.  For very fresh squid, cook until the meat had
  turned opaque and heated through.  For frozen, or "not so fresh" squid, it
  is advisable to cook a little longer.  Lift the squid out of the boiling
  water and let drain in the strainer.
  
  Place the well drained squid meat into a bowl and add fish sauce and lime
  or lemon juice.  Adjust tastes by adding more of either ingredients.  The
  tastes should be tangy sour with sufficient salty tastes.  Add lemongrass,
  ginger roots (very finely julienne), and chopped onions, and mix well.
  (Optionally, you may add dry ground hot chilli pepper to taste).
  
  Place on a serving platter (lined with lettuce leaves) and topped with
  chopped scallions, cilantro, mint leaves, and crushed hot chilli peppers.

  PS:  This makes a big cake which will keep much longer than I've ever seen
  one last.  It's also almost impossible to overbake.  A couple years ago I
  was making one as an Xmas gift for friends. I went to bed, forgetting to
  remove the cake from the oven, and it baked all night long. When I finally
  got it out of the oven (over 7 hours after it went in) the cake was
  perfectly OK except for a suface layer about " deep that was a bit dry. I
  made another cake for the gift, but my family gobbled the "mistake" in
  short order.

           Seeds OR                            6    Sprigs coriander, finely

           Seeds OR                            3 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Grind the whole spices and add any ground ones.  Into a food processor,
  pour the mixture and add the remaining ingredients (except for 1 tablespoon
  of the oil. Grind as fine as possible. Using a spatula, transfer the paste
  to a jar and pour in the last tablespoon of oil. Cap tightly and
  refrigerate until needed. Keeps 2 months in the refrigerator. Makes
  approximately 8 ounces.
  
  NOTES:  Although substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients have been made,
        this curry paste still carries the true flavor of Thailand.  Use it
  in
        Thai curries unless otherwise specified.  A little added to stir-fry
        dishes or rubbed into chicken as a marinade before barbequing or
        grilling will add a real Thai accent.  A teaspoon added to a meatloaf
        mixture or meat balls, transforms them into something that is rather
        exotic, and when combined with peanut butter and coconut milk, it
        makes a tangy and aromatic sauce for Thai-style satays.
  
        Use whole spices whenever possible.  Anchovy fillets may be
        substituted for the anchovy paste.  Shallots are preferable to
  onions;
        if not available, use an equal amount of a red onion.

      Title: Pineapple Upside-Down Cake (Skillet)
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 cn Pineapple Slices In Syrup         1/2 ts Salt
           (1 pound 4 ozs)                   1/2 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Butter                            1/4 c  Vegetable Oil (Or Solid
    2/3 c  Brown Sugar, Firmly Packed               Vegetable Shortening)
           Maraschino Cherries                 1 lg Egg
      1 c  Unbleached Flour, Unsifted        1/4 ts Grated Lemon Rind
    3/4 c  Granulated Sugar                    1 ts Lemon Juice
  1 1/2 ts Baking Powder                       1 ts Vanilla Extract
 
  This one may be a little strange to you, but is a classic in its own right.
  The difference between this one and the one you usually find in the
  cookbook, is that this one uses a skillet for a baking pan.
  
  Drain the pineapple, reserving 2 Tbls of the juice.  Melt the butter in a
  heavy 10-inch ovenproof skillet.  Stir in the brown sugar and reserved
  pineapple syrup, blending well.  Remove from the heat. Arrange the
  pineapple slices in the sugar mixture in a balanced arrangement. Place a
  maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple slice.
  
  Combine the flour, sugars, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add the
  milk and oil then beat, with an electric mixer set on high speed, for 2
  minutes.  Add the egg, lemon rind, lemon juice and vanilla extract and beat
  for an additional 2 minutes.  Carefully pour the batter over the pineapple
  in the skillet, spreading evenly. Bake in a preheated oven for 25 minutes
  or until the cake tests done. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack
  for 5 minutes. Place a serving plate upside down on the top of the skillet
  and invert the skillet and plate. Serve this cake warm.
  
  VARIATION:
  
  For Peach Upside-Down Cake, use a can of peach halves instead of the
  pineapple slices and proceed as above.

      5 lg Eggs                                1 c  7-Up (Room Temperature)
 
  This is an old recipe that comes from a request in the local paper for
  "Classic Recipes".  They called the 7-Up bottling company and they did not
  even know about it.  Someone developed this on their own and never let the
  company know about it.  BTW 7-Up comes from the popular card game in the
  1930's.
  
  Cream the margarine, shortening and sugar together beating until light and
  fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition.
  Beat in the flour, then beat in the extract and 7-Up. Blend well. Pour the
  batter into a well-greased and floured tube pan and bake at 325 degrees F
  for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

  paste.  Gradually add the cocoa mixture to the creamed mixture, stirring to
  blend well.  Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk to the creamed
  mixture, beating well after each addition. Pour the batter into the

      Title: Lefse
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Milk, scalded                     1/2 c  Lard
      1 tb Salt                                4 c  Flour
 
  Add lard, salt and 2 cups flour to scalded milk and mix well over low heat.
  Remove from fire.  Sift 2 cups of flour on board, add warm dough and work
  in flour.  Knead well and cool.
  
  This dough can be rolled immediately or kept in a cool place for a couple
  of days.  May be stored in a plastic bag.
  
  Make a small patty, about hamburger size, with even sealed edges as you
  would for pastry.  Flour board lightly and with a Scandinavian rolling pin
  roll patty in all directions, keeping the dough round.  Roll lightly,
  stretching dough until it is almost as large as the lefse baker.  Use
  pointed stick to handle dough when it is transferred from the board to the
  baker.  Brown lightly, prick air bubbles, turn and brown other side.  It
  may be necessary to change heat control from high to low.  This is a soft
  bread.  Serve with butter, or butter and sugar.
  
  (Note: I don't have either a Scandinavian rolling pin or a lefse baker, so
  I use a regular rolling pin and a griddle.  This is like a Swedish
  tortilla!  We usually spread butter and sprinkled sugar over the lefse then
  rolled them up and DEVOURED  them!)

  Contributed to the echo by: Marge Hamburger Gravy Okay... several onions,
  maybe 2 large or three medium, very coarsely chopped. 1 pound hamburger,
  probably ground chuck or leaner. Scramble/brown the hamburger and onions
  together over medium heat, keeping the meat chopped as finely as possible,
  you don't want big clumps in this, until meat is cooked, and onion
  translucent. Drain off the excess grease from the meat, trying to leave
  about a tablespoon or two in the skillet. Sprinkle a scant two tablespoons
  of water over the meat mixture, and stir it in well over low to medium
  heat. Add approximately a cup and a half of water, and stir to blend. (You
  might want to toss a bouillion cube in at this point, won't hurt it any!)
  Simmer, stirring, until the "gravy" thickens... Taste and see about adding
  a healthy shake or three of pepper and (if you omitted the bouillion cube)
  a dash of salt. Won't hurt it to stay warm on the back of the stove for a
  while while the potatoes finish boiling, the flavor will go into the gravy
  more that way. Howzat for indefinite? But there WAS no recipe...we just
  made it!

  is in mixer bowl. Add 2 eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.
  Blend in milk and vanilla. (If mixture looks slightly curdled, don't worry
  ~ it bakes out.) Spread cooled pineapple layer over bottom of pie shell.
  Pour cream cheese mixture over pineapple; sprinkle with pecans. Bake at 400
  degrees for 10 minutes; reduce heat to 325 and bake for 50 minutes. Cool.
