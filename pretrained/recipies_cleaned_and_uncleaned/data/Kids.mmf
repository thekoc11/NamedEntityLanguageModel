      Title: Angu (Cornmeal Mush)
 Categories: Cereal, Brazil
   Servings:  6
 
           INGREDIENTS:
      1 tb Oil
      2    Clove garlic, minced (2 tsp)
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped (about
           -1/4 cup)
      2 c  Cold water (to 3 cups)
           Salt & fresh ground black
           -pepper
    1/2 c  Fine (stone ground) cornmeal
 
  Servings: 6 to 8 Notes: Angu (pronounced "aing goo") is a sort of polenta,
  one of the many cooked starch pastes one finds in Brazil. For best results,
  use a fine, stone ground cornmeal.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Cook the garlic and onion
  over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add 2 cups
  water and bring to a rapid boil.
  
  Add the cornmeal in a thin stream through your fingers, stirring vigorously
  to prevent lumps. The mixture should be the consistency of choux pastry or
  soft ice cream. If too thick, make a hole in the angu with a wooden spoon
  and stir in a little cold water. Reduce the heat to low and gently simmer
  for 3 to 4 minutes. Correct the seasoning and serve at once.
  
  Note: For a prettier presentation, the angu can be spooned into a thickly
  buttered tube pan and unmolded onto a platter. (Picture in magazine shows
  that a fluted tube pan was used, and the center of the unmolded angu was
  filled with flat leaf parsley- or cilantro?

      Title: Basic Pizza Dough
 Categories: Pizza
   Servings:  6
 
      1 c  Warm tap water (110 to 115
           -degrees)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      3    To 3 1/2 cups flour
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  1.  Pour the water into a medium-sized mixing bowl and sprinkle in the
  yeast. Stir gently with a fork until the yeast has dissolved and the liquid
  turns light beige in color.
  
  2.  Add 1 cup of the flour and the salt.  Mix thoroughly with a wooden
  spoon.  Add a second cup of flour to the bowl and mix well. After the
  second cup of flour has been mixed in, the dough should start coming away
  from the sides of the bowl and should begin to form a soft,sticky mass.
  
  3.  Measure out the third cup of flour.  Sprinkle some over the work
  surface and flour your hands generously.  Remove all of the dough from the
  bowl and begin to work the mass by kneading the additional flour in a bit
  at a time.
  
  4.  To knead the dough, use the heel of your hands to push the dough across
  the floured work surface in one sweep.  Clench the dough in your fist and
  twist and fold it over.  Use the dough scraper to help gather the wet dough
  that sticks to the work surface into a ball while kneading. Repeat this
  action over and over again, adding only as much flour as it takes to keep
  the dough from sticking to your hands.  Work quickly and don't be delicate.
  Slap and push the dough around to develop its gluten and to facilitate its
  rolling out. (Kneading pizza dough is a great way to relieve pent-up
  aggression!)
  
  5.  When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand down
  into it and hold it there for 10 seconds.  This will test its readiness;if
  your hand comes up clean, the dough is done.  If it sticks, a bit more
  kneading will be necessary. Once the dough is no longer sticky, do not
  overwork it by adding more flour.  Continue kneading only until the dough
  is smooth and elastic (it should spring back when pressed) and no lines of
  raw white flour show.  The whole process should take 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  6.  Lightly oil a 2 quart bowl with vegetable oil.  Roll the ball of dough
  around in the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil.  Tightly seal the
  bowl with plastic wrap to trap in the moisture and heat from the yeast's
  carbon dioxide gases.  This will help the dough rise faster.
  
  7.  Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free place.  Let the dough rise for 30
  to 45 minutes.
  
  8.  Once the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down by pushing your fist
  into it.  All of the gases will quickly escape, and the dough will
  collapse. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it again for about 1
  minute.
  
  9.  The dough is now ready to be patted and rolled into pizza, or to
  undergo additional rising.
  
  10. To raise dough a second time, add a bit more oil to the bowl and repeat
  the procedure indicated for the first rising.  Then the dough is ready to
  be shaped.

  "This recipe descends from ne of the oldest known kinds of pizza crust. The
  Romans, who were very fond of black pepper, used a similar but richer
  dough, which included eggs and honey.  Naturally rendered pork lard is
  essential to this crust.  If you can't get any, use the same amount of

      Title: Boiled Peanuts
 Categories: Snacks
   Servings:  8
 
           Peanuts,raw
           Water
 
  1. Wash raw peanuts thoroughly in cool water; then soak in clean cool water
  for about 30 minutes before cooking.
  2. Put peanuts in a saucepan and cover completely with water. Because the
  shells of some peanuts absorb more salt than others, it's best to begin
  with 1 tablespoon of salt for each 2 cups of peanuts; you can add more salt
  to taste later.
  3. The cooking period for boiled peanuts varies according to the maturity
  of the peanuts used and the variety of peanut. The cooking time for a
  "freshly pulled" green peanut is shorter than for a peanut which has been
  stored for a time.
  4. When fully cooked, the texture of the peanut should be similar to that
  of a cooked dry pea or bean. Boil the peanuts for about 35 minutes, then
  taste. If they are not salted enough, add more salt. Taste again in 10
  minutes, both for salt content and to see if the peanuts are fully cooked.
  If not ready, continue tasting every 5 minutes until they have a
  satisfactory texture.
  5. Drain peanuts after cooking or they will continue to absorb salt and
  become oversalted.
  6. Boiled peanuts are usually served as a snack, but they make a great
  substitute for dried cooked beans at any meal. They may be eaten hot, at
  room temperature, or chilled in the refrigerator and eaten cold, shelling
  as you eat them. They will keep in the refrigerator for several days, or
  they may be frozen.

      Title: Callos a la Madrilena
 Categories: Spanish, Snacks
   Servings:  4
 
      1 lb "honeycomb" tripe
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      1 sm Tomato, chopped
      1    Pig's foot or veal knuckle,
           -split in half
      2    Sprigs parsley
     10    Peppercorns, lightly crushed
      2    Cloves, crushed
      1 ds Of nutmeg
      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 ts Dried thyme, or equivalent
           -amount of fresh
           Salt
      1 sm Onion, coarsely chopped
      6    Cloves garlic, peeled
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
    1/4 lb Chorizo (or Italian
           -sausage), in 1/4-inch
           -slices
    1/4 c  Diced cured (unsmoked) ham
      1 tb Flour
      1 tb Sweet red (Spanish) paprika
    1/2    Dried red chili pepper,
           -crumbled (remove seeds if
           -you wish)
 
  (Tripe, Madrid Style)
  
  Tripe is especially favored in Spain and, in fact, most countries where
  there is still a strong Spanish influence.  This isn't surprising, because
  it makes a number of very different, but extremely tasty dishes.  It
  requires long cooking times (less here because it is almost always cleaned
  and partially precooked when you buy it), but it keeps very well for days,
  in the refrigerator, and is even better when reheated than when first
  prepared.  Since it's difficult to buy half a pig's foot or half a veal
  knuckle, this recipe makes enough for 4 - 6 servings as a main course. Make
  a full recipe a day or two ahead of time, serve as many tapas as needed,
  then enjoy the rest as a main course or snacks.  This can be reheated very
  nicely in the microwave, by the way.
  
  To serve 4 - 6 as a main course, or make 12 - 18 tapas:
  
  Rinse the tripe well, then put it into a rather large kettle and add cold
  water to cover.  Bring to a boil, then drain immediately. Cut the tripe
  into 1 1/2-inch squares and return it to the empty kettle.  Add 3 cups cold
  water and the wine, tomato, pig's foot or veal knuckle, parsley,
  peppercorns, cloves, nutmeg, bay leaves, thyme, salt to taste, coarsely
  chopped onion and the garlic.  Cover and simmer over low heat for 4 to 5
  hours, until the tripe is almost tender.
  
  Heat the oil in a skillet and saute the finely chopped onion until it is
  wilted.  Add the chorizo and ham and cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in the flour
  and paprika and cook 1 minute more.  Add 1/2 cup of the liquid from the
  tripe kettle, a little at a time, and cook-stir until the mixture thickens.
  
  Add this and the chile to the tripe.  Cover and cook 1 - 2 hours more.
  Remove the cover and continue cooking until the tripe is very tender.
  
  Remove the pig's foot or veal knuckle from the tripe.  Remove and discard
  all skin, bone and fat.  Cut the meat into pieces and stir into the tripe.
  
  Serve in warmed bowls or shallow individual tapa-size dishes.  Serve with
  good crusty bread for sopping up the sauce.

 Categories: Kids, Snacks
   Servings:  6
 
    1/2 c  (8 tbsp) honey
    1/2 c  Margarine
      6 c  POPPED popcorn
      1 c  Shelled peants
 
  From: Vicki Lansky's CANDY book
  
  COOKIE JAR
  
  Have you thought of putting crackers in your cookie jar? They are made with
  less sugar and you can choose a low salt variety. You can fill a cookie jar
  with peanuts-in-th-shell or roasted no-salt nuts. Or keep on hand a jar of
  nuts and raisins with a few chocolate chips thrown in (aka "gorp").
  
  POPCORN
  
  Try sprinkling grated Parmesan cheese or American cheese on popcorn. Or,
  mix with peanuts, or cinnamon.
  
  Package extra popcorn in small plastic bags with twist ties - excellent for
  an out-of-doors treat, car ride (Donna's note: UGH!) or TV special snack.
  (Donna's note: lunch boxes!)
  
  HONEY "CRACKER JACKS"
  
  Heat honey and butter in a saucepan until blended. Cool. Pour over popcorn
  which has been mixed with peanuts, stirring as you pour. When well-coated,
  spread in a pan in a single layer. Bake at 350 for 5 - 10 minutes or until
  crisp, stirring several times. The difference between crisp (not brown) and
  burnt can be a matter of minutes. Package in plastic bags and twist tie. If
  you want it to be mistaken for the "real thing", add a small toy.
  
  POPCORN CANDY CLUSTERS
  
  1 cup (8 oz) semi-sweet chocolate chips 1 cup freshly popped popcorn 1 cup
  nuts
  
  Melt chocolate chips. Add popcorn and nuts and stir until they are well
  coated. Drop by spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet or wax paper and let set til
  firm. If the crowd is rushing you for a taste, chill the clusters in the
  freezer for 5 minutes. When firm, store in plastic bags.
  
  CRUNCHO MIX
  
  Mix: 4 cups crunchy cereal (Cheerios, or Corn Chex, etc) 1 cup peanuts or
  mixed nuts 1 cup pretzel sticks, the smallest size 1 cup seasoned croutons
  
  Combine: 1/2 cup salad oil or 6 tbsp melted butter 2 tsp Worcestershire
  Sauce 1/4 tsp garlic powder
  
  In a shallow pan coat crunchy ingredients with the combined oil and
  seasonings. Heat in oven at 250 for about 45 minutes, stirring every 15
  minutes. Spread on absorbent paper to cool.

      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Dates
      1 c  Flour
 
  I got this recipe from a lady who is now in her 90's and still going
  strong. She said this recipe came from the 1920's sometime and was used in
  my neck of the woods, out Barkerville way. (a gold rush town from the
  1890's that has been made into a tourist trap) Because there were so many
  Chinese that came up to make there fortune, it ended up being called
  Chinese Chews, but she swears that the name is Date Chewsticks.
  
  BEGIN RECIPE::::::::
  
  NOTE:  no margarine or shortening!!!!
  
  Beat eggs and sugar, add baking powder, vanilla, and flour.  Add the dates
  last and mix thoroughly.  Batter will be thick.  Pour into a greased 8 x 8
  pan and bake at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes. When cooled sprinkle icing sugar
  over the top and rub in until completely coated with icing sugar.
  
  Can be doubled and baked in a 9 x 13 pan.  Takes about 10 - 15 minutes
  longer.
  
  I have also used that candied fruit that is available at Xmas in place of
  the dates and it is wonderful. To make it real fancy for a "DO", use a
  paper doily before sprinkling the icing sugar on top.

  From "Baby's First Helpings" by Chris Casson Madden ISBN: 0-385-19143-X
  
  This is a good way to introduce eggs to your baby (if the pediatrician says
  you are ready to).  Eggs contain all 22 of the amino acids-the building
  blocks of protein-that we need for new tissues, clotting of blood, and
  formation of antibodies.
  
  Cold water Mother's milk or formula
  
  Place egg in a small saucepan and cover with water.  Bring to a boil and
  simmer very gently for 15 minutes.  Remove and immediately fill pan with
  running cold water.  Let sit in cold water until shell is cool.  Crack
  open, discard the white and mash the yellow yolk with a fork and add a few
  drops breast milk or formula. Go easy (small amounts of egg for baby) at
  first to see if any allergies develop.

  Using 1 quart of freshly made popcorn as a serving size; select one of the
  listed flavor combinations and follow directions.  In most cases adding the
  flavor to the melted butter or margarine would be the easiest method. The
  strawberry flavored drink mix will give strawberry flavored popcorn. The
  instant Cappuccino mix will give Cappuccino flavor.  The dry Blue Cheese
  and garlic salt will give Blue Cheese flavor.  The combination of curry
  powder, cumin and garlic salt is good for curry.  Chili seasoning will give
  a south of the border flavor and finally adding Tabasco sauce to your taste
  to the melted butter will give that added kick some may prefer.

      Title: Honey "Cracker Jacks"
 Categories: Snacks
   Servings:  6
 
    1/2 c  Honey
    1/2 c  Margarine
      6 c  Popped popcorn
      1 c  Shelled peanuts
 
  Heat honey and margarine in a saucepan until well blended. Cool. Combine
  popcorn and peanuts in a large bowl.  Pour honey mix over popcorn, stirring
  as you pour.  When popcorn and peanuts are well coated, spread in a pan in
  a single layer. Bake at 350 degrees for 5 to 10 minutes or until crisp but
  not brown, stirring several times. The difference between crisp (not brown)
  and burnt can be a matter of minutes.  Keep in an air tight container.
  
  My Note:  This doesn't really taste like cracker jacks but it was sure
  good.  I'll use more popcorn next time as the popcorn really soaked the
  honey butter up fast and some was positively soggy.

      Title: Pizza Dough - Roman Focaccia
 Categories: Pizza
   Servings:  6
 
      2 pk Fast-rising dry yeast
      2 c  Tepid (90F) water
      2 tb Sugar
      4 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Oil
      1 ts Salt
  5 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
      3    Cloves garlic, crushed
    1/4 c  Olive oil for topping (if
           -making focaccia only)
      1 tb Whole rosemary (ditto)
      1 tb Kosher salt (ditto)
 
  From:   Ted Taylor
  
  The following recipe is for "focaccia Romana," or Roman focaccia, from Jeff
  Smith's "The Frigal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient Cuisines."  He recommends
  it as the best dough for a pizza crust he's run across, and I must say it
  is both
  
  very easy and VERY good to eat.  I halved the following recipe (but used
  the full amount of garlic, plus 2 c of meaty red sauce, about 4 oz. of
  pepperoni, 8-9 fresh mushrooms and 8 ounces of whole-milk mozzarella) and
  the results were great. Lacking quick-rise yeast, I used regular yeast and
  just ate a little later -- no problem there. And of course, I made the
  dough into a pizza instead of a plain focaccia (which is like a thick pizza
  (also round, but thicker) but without toppings.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in the tepid water.  Add the sugar, olive oil, oil, and
  salt.  Mix in 3 c of the flour and whip until the dough begins to leave the
  sides of the mixing bowl, about ten minutes [!!]. I [Smith] use my
  KitchenAid mixer for the whole process.
  
  Mix in the remaining flour by hand or with a dough hook and knead the dough
  until it is smooth.  Allow the dough to rise twice, right in the bowl, and
  punch down after each rising.
  
  Oil 2 baking sheets, each 13 inches by 18 inches, and divide the dough
  between the 2 pans.  Using your fingers, press the dough out to the edges
  of each pan. Allow to rise for about 30 minutes and brush with the crushed
  garlic mixed with the oil for topping. Sprinkle the rosemary and kosher
  salt on top.
  
  Bake at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes.

      Title: Popcorn Balls
 Categories: Snacks, Kids
   Servings:  6
 
      2 qt Popped popcorn
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Light or dark corn syrup
    1/3 c  Water
    1/4 c  Butter/margarine
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  FROM:      Shelley Rodgers (Jolly Rodgers: the Portuguese Pirate!
  1:161/202)
  
  Keep popcorn warm in 200~ oven while preparing coating.  In 2-quart
  saucepan stir together sugar, corn syrup, water, butter and salt.  Cook
  over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.
  Continue cooking without stirring until temperature reaches 270~ on a candy
  thermometer or until a small amount dropped into very cold water separates
  into threads which are hard but not brittle.  Remove from heat. Add
  vanilla; stir just enough to mix through hot syrup.  Slowly pour over
  popcorn, stirring to coat every kernel.  Cool just enough to handle. With
  greased hands, shape into balls.
  
  VARIATION: Use almond, pepermint or other flavor extract instead of
  vanilla. For colorful popcorn balls, stir a few drops of food coloring into
  syrup before adding to popped popcorn. [ Jolly Time popcorn ]

      Title: Pretzels
 Categories: Snacks
   Servings:  6
 
      1 pk Yeast
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
  4 1/2    To 5 cups flour
      2 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
 
  Combine yeast and 1/2 c warm water in measuring cup, stirring with fork
  until dissolved.
  
  Combine 2 c flour, salt, and sugar in bowl.  Add dissolved yeast and
  remaining 1 c warm water. Beat vigorously with whisk or spoon for 2
  minutes. Gradually add enough of remaining flour, 1/4 c at a time, to make
  a soft dough. Turn out of bowl. Knead until smooth and elastic, adding as
  little flour as necessary, about 8-10 minutes.
  
  Place dough in bowl, cover with plastic wrap, put in warm place to rise
  until doubled in size.
  
  Punch down dough and divide into 12 equal portions.  Roll each portion into
  an 18-20 inch long rope, slightly tapered and thinner at ends. (My Note:
  you may need to allow the dough to rest once or twice if it's too elastic
  to hold the rope shape. It also helps to roll if your hands are clean and
  slightly damp - you'll have to rinse them in between every piece or so.)
  Form into pretzel shapes. Place on 5-inch squares of baking parchment.
  Cover with a towel and let rest 20-30 minutes.
  
  Bring to a boil 6 cups of water, 1/3 cup baking soda, and 1/3 cup salt in a
  large shallow pan.  Gently drop 3 or 4 pretzels into the simmering water,
  parchment side up.  Remove parchment.  Poach first side 2 minutes.  Turn
  and poach other side 2 minutes. Remove pretzels with slotted spatula and
  place on towel to cool.
  
  Brush with an egg white wash (1 egg white mixed with 1 Tbsp water).
  Sprinkle with coarse salt (available in health food stores) Bake on
  >greased< and >foil lined< baking sheets at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.
  Remove from baking sheet and cool on wire racks.
  
  These freeze very well.

 Categories: Pizza
   Servings:  6
 
      4 tb Sweet butter, cut into 4
           -pieces
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Instant nonfat dry milk
           -powder
    3/4 c  Water
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  4 1/2    To 5 cups all purpose white
           -flour
      1 ts Salt
      3    Extra large eggs, beaten
 
  "For an elegant change of pace, this rich brioche-like dough makes a thick,
  utterly delicious pizza crust.  French Provencale pizza or pissaladiere
  fillings are exceptionally good on it.  Its most spectacular presentation
  though, comes in the form of torta rustica with its majestic crown of dough
  leaves and multilayered colorful filling.  This dough is characteristically
  soft.  Work it only until it no longer sticks to your fingers. For an extra
  golden, shiny finish, brush a thin coating of egg white glaze (1 egg white
  beaten with a Tbsp of water) over the top of the dough."
  
  1. Put the butter, sugar, dry milk powder, and water in a small saucepan.
  Stir briefly to dissolve the solids and heat the mixture over medium heat
  until bubbles begin to appear around the sides of the pan.  Remove from the
  heat and pour the mixture into a large mixing bowl.
  
  2. When the liquid mixture no longer feels too hot to the touch( no more
  than 130 degrees)sprinkle the yeast over it and stir with a fork until the
  yeast dissolves.
  
  3. Stir in 2 cups of the flour, the salt, and eggs with a wooden spoon.
  
  4. Add about a cup of flour 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until the dough
  forms a soft, sticky mass and comes away from the sides of the bowl.
  
  5. Dust your hands and the work surface liberally with some of the
  remaining flour.  Remove the dough form the bowl and knead in the remaining
  flour a bit at a time, until the dough is smooth and elastic and no longer
  sticks to your hands.  Don't try to push all of the flour into the dough.
  You may not need it all.
  
  6. Roll the dough around in an oiled bowl, cover the bowl tightly with
  plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place until it has
  doubled in bulk (about 1 hour).
  
  7. Punch the dough down, knead it briefly, and return it to the bowl.
  Recover with plastic wrap and let it double again before using (This dough
  must go through 2 risings.)
  
  8. After the dough has doubled in bulk a second time, it is ready to be
  rolled or pressed into shape. Note: For thicker crust, let the dough rise
  in a prepared pizza pan for 30 minutes before baking.  This dough should
  not be baked at temperatures above "400 degrees" or it will burn.

  Use a semi-thawed frankfurter, which is easier to cut. With a knife, make a
  straight horizontal slit aboyt 1" from the top. On both sides of the frank,
  make a slit upward so the franks looks like it has 2 arms. From the bottom
  of the frank, make a 1" slit upwards, to make 2 legs. Broil in the oven. As
  the frank cooks, the "arms" and "legs" will curl out a bit, making it look
  more like a person.  When done, remove from oven and decorate with mustard
  or catsup. Put on eyes, a mouth, buttons, perhaps shoes, etc. Kids love
  this, especially if they can help with the decorating!

  chopped celery                  sliced egg
  
  Note: Mayonnaise in a sandwich does not hold up well without refrigeration,
  and could cause poisoning. It turns rancid upon prolonged exposure to heat.
  Avoid using it for summer camp lunches, or if your child's lunch will be
  sitting on a radiator in school all morning. Mayonnaise usually does not
  freeze well. If the amount you are using in your sandwich is small,
  however, you should have no trouble keeping sandwiches mixed with
  mayonnaise in the freezer. This also holds true for egg salad that is well
  mashed.
  
  Hint: Reduce the fat content of added mayonnaise by combining
  
  Cream Cheese Combines well with: bacon bits crushed pineapple chpped nuts
  luncheon meats peanut butter sliced egg sliced cucumber marmalade or jam
  raisins, whole or ground
  
  Hint: one enrichment technique is to mix a tablespoon of powdered milk into
  an 8-oz bar of cream cheese.

      Title: Sicilian-Style Pizza Dough
 Categories: Pizza
   Servings:  6
 
  1 1/2 c  Warm tap water (110 to 115
           -degrees)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  4 1/2    To 5 cups flour
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 ts Salt
 
  1.  Pour the water into a medium-sized mixing bowl and sprinkle in the
  yeast. Stir gently with a fork until the yeast has dissolved and the liquid
  turns light beige in color.
  
  2.  Add 2 cups of the flour, the olive oil, and the salt.  Mix thoroughly
  with a wooden spoon.  Add a third cup of flour to the bowl and mix well.
  After the third cup of flour has been mixed in, the dough should start
  coming away from the sides of the bowl and should begin to form a
  soft,sticky mass.
  
  3.  Measure out the fourth cup of flour.  Sprinkle some over the work
  surface and flour your hands generously.  Remove all of the dough from the
  bowl and begin to work the mass by kneading the additional flour in a bit
  at a time.
  
  4.  To knead the dough, use the heel of your hands to push the dough across
  the floured work surface in one sweep.  Clench the dough in your fist and
  twist and fold it over.  Use the dough scraper to help gather the wet dough
  that sticks to the work surface into a ball while kneading. Repeat this
  action over and over again, adding only as much flour as it takes to keep
  the dough from sticking to your hands.  Work quickly and don't be delicate.
  Slap and push the dough around to develop its gluten and to facilitate its
  rolling out. (Kneading pizza dough is a great way to relieve pent-up
  aggression!)
  
  5.  When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand down
  into it and hold it there for 10 seconds.  This will test its readiness;if
  your hand comes up clean, the dough is done.  If it sticks, a bit more
  kneading will be necessary. Once the dough is no longer sticky, do not
  overwork it by adding more flour.  Continue kneading only until the dough
  is smooth and elastic (it should spring back when pressed) and no lines of
  raw white flour show.  The whole process should take 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  6.  Lightly oil a 2 quart bowl with vegetable oil.  Roll the ball of dough
  around in the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil.  Tightly seal the
  bowl with plastic wrap to trap in the moisture and heat from the yeast's
  carbon dioxide gases.  This will help the dough rise faster.
  
  7.  Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free place.  Let the dough rise for 30
  to 45 minutes.
  
  8.  Once the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down by pushing your fist
  into it.  All of the gases will quickly escape, and the dough will
  collapse. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it again for about 1
  minute.
  
  9.  The dough is now ready to be patted and rolled into pizza, or to
  undergo additional rising.
  
  10. To raise dough a second time, add a bit more oil to the bowl and repeat
  the procedure indicated for the first rising.  Then the dough is ready to
  be shaped.

  measurments...is a "what you have"... Spanish hot dogs & rice: Enough rice
  for four people... put rice on to cook...while it's cooking slice as many
  hot dogs as you have (lets say 1/2 pound or more) into pennies, about 1/2
  inch thick. dice 1 green pepper...I used to use the frozen diced pepper and
  use a couple of handsful..maybe 3/4 cup? Diced onion. ditto on the amount.
  combine all the above, heat, while the rice is cooking...set the table and
  spray on some perfume.
  
  This is obviously not a gourmet feast for company. But everyone ATE it! and
  there is little that's faster or easier!

  coconut flavoring.  Add skim milk or low-fat yogurt and blend smooth. A
  small amount of milk or yogurt will create a "frozen custard."  Add more
  milk or yogurt for a milkshake.  Add a whole egg for a high-protein instant
  breakfast or lunch. (Top with a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg, if desired.)
  
  Skim milk has approximately 45 calories per 1/2 cup; plain low-fat yogurt,

      Title: Whipped Cream Graham Cake
 Categories: Kids, Snacks
   Servings:  6
 
      1 pt (2 cups) heavy cream
      2 tb Honey or sugar
     32    Squares (16 rectangles) of
           -graham crackers
           Sprinkles
 
  Beat cream with sweetener until stiff. Spread whipped cream heavily on one
  square and place it on a platter. Spread cream heavily on a second square
  and place it on top of the first. Continue until there is a stack of 4
  squares. Press down gently on the top square so the cream squeezes out of
  the sides. Spread the excess along the sides. Repeat the procedure until
  there are eight stacks. Slide them together till sides touch to form a
  rectangular cake of 2 squares by 4 squares. Use extra whipped cream to
  smooth over all the tops. Refrigerate. Allowing it to chill several hours
  before serving enables the crackers to soften. A dash of sprinkles over the
  top adds a party flavor with adding much additional sugar.
  
  Hint: Use a pressurized can of whipped cream if you don't have the time or
  inclination to whip the cream.
