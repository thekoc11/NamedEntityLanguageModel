  roll out the pastry and cut out six 4-5" rounds. Place rounds on a thick
  baking sheet and sprinkle with a little cold water. Place baking sheet in
  freezer until ready to assemble and bake tarts. Slice the tomatoes and lay
  them on paper towels for thirty minutes to drain off excess moisture. This
  will prevent the tarts from being soggy. One half hour before serving,
  preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Take the baking sheet from the freezer and
  spread a layer of Thick Tomato Coulis over the pastry rounds leaving 1/2
  inch rim around the edge. Arrange the drained tomato slices over the coulis
  and scatter with shredded basil. Sprinkle with salt and some freshly grated
  black pepper then drizzle with oil. Immediately place in the oven and bake
  for 20 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and golden. Serve at once.

  Contributed to the echo by: Fred Towner Originally from: Paul Prudhomme's
  Louisiana Kitchen Well, here it is Michelle. Don't say I didn't warn you.
  This recipe produces a volume of smoke that would rival a tire dump fire,
  but the aromas will drive everyone crazy. It's even worth having your
  neighbors and landlord upset with you. ;-) Cajun Prime Rib - Blackened
  
  Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this for you) and save.
  Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large roasting pan.
  Then with a knife make several dozen punctures through the silver skin so
  seasoning can permeate meat. Pour a very generous, even layer of black
  pepper over the top of the meat (the pepper should completely cover it);
  repeat with the garlic powder, then the salt, totally covering the
  preceding layer. Carefully arrange the onions in an even layer on top so as
  not to knock off the seasoning. Place the fat cap back on top. Refrigerate
  24 hours.
  
  Bake ribs in a 550F oven until the fat is dark brown and crispy on top,
  about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and cool slightly. Refrigerate until
  well chilled, about 3 hours. (This is done so the juices will solidify and
  the steaks can be cooked rare.) Remove fat cap and disgard. With the blade
  of a large knife, scrape off the onions and as much of the seasonings as
  possible and discard. Then with a long knife, slice between ribs into 6
  steaks (4 will have bones); trim the cooked surface of meat from the 2
  pieces that were on the outside of the roast. Season and cook in your
  favorite way for steaks.
  
  TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS: Combine the ingredients of the seasoning mix
  thoroughly in a small bowl; you will have about 8 Tb. Sprinkle the steaks
  generously and evenly on both sides with the mix. using about 4 ts on each
  steak and pressing it in with your hands.
  
  Heat a cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the smoking
  stage and you see white ash on the skillet bottom--at least 10 minutes.
  (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.) Place one steak in the hot
  skillet (cook only one side at a time) and cook over a very high heat until
  the underside starts to develop a heavy, black crust, about 2 to 3 minutes.
  Turn the steak over and cook until the underside is crusted like the first,
  about 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining steaks. Serve each
  steak while piping hot.
  
  (*NOTE*: If you don't have a commercial hood vent over your stove, this
  dish may smoke you out of the kitchen. It's worth it! But you can also cook
  it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get hot enough to
  "blacken" the steak properly. (FHT-if you have a smoke detector in your
  house, you will be able to determine if it is working correctly.) This is
  NOT a dish to prepare in an apartment building with a central fire alarm
  system wired into your smoke detector. It causes great excitement! Also,
  you can be guaranteed you will meet your landlord.)

      2    Green peppers, sliced               2 cl Garlic
      1    Onion, sliced thick, or cut              Chicken broth

      1    Fresh mushrooms                
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Marge Clark Chicken Da Vinci Saute Italian
  Sausage slices until done, remove from pan. In the grease from the
  sausages, with olive oil added as necessary, saute the garlic and green
  peppers. When peppers are about 1/2 done, add the onion. Cook until veggies
  are barely tender, still a trifle crisp, but not browned. Remove from pan
  and add to sausages. Add more oil, saute mushrooms until browned, remove
  and add to rest of the stuff. Last step, saute the chicken until done. Add
  everything else back into the pan, season generously with rosemary and
  oregano. Throwing a little basil in won't hurt it either. If the dish seems
  dry, add small amounts of either plain chicken broth or a broth & white
  wine mix. If you've added too much liquid, then thicken it with cornstarch.

      1 ts White vinegar                       1 ts Crushed red pepper
      1 ts Extra virgin olive oil [go          1 tb Dried oregano OR
           For the greenest you can        2 1/2 tb Fresh oregano if available
           Find]                             1/2 ts Salt
      3 c  Regular olive oil [all         
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Bill Birner Originally from: La Cucina di
  Andrea's New Orleans Extra Virgin Recipes 1. Slice the skins off the
  eggplants, and slice them about 1/4 inch thick from top to bottom. Then
  slice across to get pieces the size of French fries. Put the eggplant
  strips in a bowl and toss with the 1/2 cup of salt.
  
  2. Move the eggplant strips into a colander, arraying them in a relatively
  uniform layer up the sides. Put a bowl the same size as the colander inside
  the colander and weigh it down with three or so pounds of weight. [I find a
  foil covered common solid brick is a handy kitchen tool.] Put the entire
  apparatus in the sink to drain for 45 minutes. This will remove any
  bitterness from the eggplant.
  
  3. Rinse the salt off the eggplant with cold water. Drain it well, then
  SQUEEZE it dry. Put the eggplant in a bowl with the vinegar, and marinate
  it for 30 minutes. [It will return to shape like a wet sponge.]
  
  4. Drain the vinegar from the eggplant and squeeze it dry again. Put the
  eggplant into a bowl with all the other ingredients.
  
  5. Pour the contents into a canning jar. Make SURE there is enough olive
  oil to completely cover all the eggplant about 1/2 inch deep. Tightly seal
  and refrigerate the jar. Marinate for at least a week; The ideal time is
  actually three months, and the eggplant will keep getting better even after
  that.

      1 lg Can (about 51-oz)                   2 tb Flour
 
  The day before you wish to serve the soup, fry the bacon until crisp and
  remove. In bacon drippings, saute onion, celery with leaves and potatoes
  for 10-15 minutes at medium heat. Add the minced clams, not clam soup but
  clams, with their juice. Crumble the bacon and add. Cover soup and simmer
  over low heat, stirring occasionally, for several hours - up to five hours
  won't hurt. Cool down and place in refrigerator at night. On the day of
  serving, skim grease off top. Transfer soup to larger pot. Heat soup until
  bubbling and add the seafood seasoning. Mix 2 cups of the half and half
  with the flour. Add to the chowder and stir until it bubbles again. Mix in
  remaining half and half and simmer, stirring constantly, until soup is

  Saute onion and tomato in oil until onion is golden and tomato is soft. In
  a bowl mash up the cooked lentils a little. Add onion & tomato; mix in
  garlic powder, salt, milk, cheese, and 1 cup of the bread crumbs. Preheat
  oven to 350. Glop mixture into oiled loaf pan, sprinkle remaining crumbs on
  top and bake for 1/2 hour or until done. You could add a Tbs. of
  ketchup...you could put just about anything in there (celery, bell
  pepper...) Tonight I'm going to beat one egg and mix it in to make the loaf
  stick together better. And maybe add a touch of ketchup or BBQ sauce or
  something. You can serve with any sauce or gravy or anything.

      8 oz Red wine                       
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Debra Heng SPAGHETTI SAUCE WITH ITALIAN SAUSAGE
  
  In a dutch oven, brown the sausages well (still in their casings) in a
  little olive oil. Use tongs to remove sausage to top of pot lid. Drain off
  fat if necessary, leaving about 1 T in pot. Toss in onion, green pepper and
  garlic and stir to coat, scraping up the brown bits from bottom of pot. Let
  cook for about 2 minutes, just 'til the onion and pepper begin to soften
  (do not brown). Return sausage to pot and stir in tomatos or sauce, paste,
  sugar, wine, seasonings and Parmesan. Simmer for 45-60 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, saute mushrooms in a dab of butter, dash of olive oil, sprinkle
  of marjoram or basil and paprika. Add the mushrooms and any juice in the
  pan to the saucepan during last 15 minutes of cooking. Add optional
  American cheese a few minutes before serving, let melt & stir in. This
  really mellows out the sauce.
  
  Tips: You can brown pork shoulder blades or spareribs along with the
  sausage. Gives a great flavor and provides a 2nd meat course if you're
  having company. Use more or less wine, depending on whether you're using
  whole tomatos or sauce. Just aim for a nice thick sauce. Leftovers make
  great sausage sandwiches. I freeze mine a lot for quick meals later.

    1/4 c  Firmly packed *light* brown              Coffee
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman HAM & REDEYE GRAVY Remove the ham
  steaks from their fry-drippings and measure out 4 tbsp. of the fat. Dispose
  of the rest. Stir the sugar into the pan at LOW heat, stirring constantly,
  until the sugar dissolves. Add the coffee, and simmer until the gravy turns
  a rich brown (maybe 5 minutes or so). DO NOT ALLOW THE GRAVY TO BOIL! Pour
  the gravy over the ham and serve.
  
  (NOTE): If you're using uncooked slices of a salty, dry-cured ham, add a
  cup of water to the skillet along with the ham. The ham will absorb all the
  water by the time it's cooked through. Add more water if the original
  amount is absorbed too quickly.
  
  If you're using salt pork, or pork belly fat (like bacon, but unsmoked), be
  sure to blanch it before using. To blanch, cover with cold water, bring to
  a boil, simmer 3 minutes, then drain. Fry a little chunk, and if it's still
  too salty, blanch it again.

      4 tb All-purpose flour              
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Pat the chicken pieces dry and sprinkle with salt and
  pepper. Heat the oil in a large covered oven-proof casserole or Dutch oven
  over medium-high heat on top of the stove. Add the chicken pieces and brown
  well on all sides, about 7 minutes. The chicken should not crowd the pan so
  you may have to perform this operation in batches. Remove pieces to a plate
  as they are done. Discard all but 2 tablespoons oil, reduce heat to medium
  and replace skillet on the stove top. Add onion, carrot, celery and garlic
  and cook about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with flour and cook, stirring, another
  minute. Add the stock, tomato paste and bay leaves. Replace the chicken
  thighs and drumsticks in the casserole with any accumulated juices from the
  chicken. Cover and bring to a boil. Place the casserole in the oven. After
  15 minutes, add the reserved breasts and cook 20 minutes longer. Remove
  from the oven, remove the chicken from the casserole and set aside. Strain
  the sauce through a fine sieve and discard vegetables. Place bacon in
  another medium oven-proof pot on the stove over medium heat and cook,
  stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Pour off excess fat and add the
  mushrooms, brandy, milk, cream and braising sauce. Mix well. Arrange
  chicken pieces on the bacon-mushroom mixture, cover and place in the oven
  for 15 minutes or until bubbling hot. To serve, arrange the chicken pieces
  on a platter and spoon the bacon, mushrooms and sauce over the top and
  garnish with tarragon.

  DEFROST COOKED MEAT, if necessary. Cut the ends off the bread and cut each
  loaf in half the short way. Remove the center of the bread. (Save the white
  centers for breadcrumbs.) Set the hollow loaves aside. Arrange the bacon in
  a large skillet or fry pan and place over medium heat. Cook, turning once,
  until crisp. Remove the bacon, drain on paper towels and discard the fat in
  the pan. Replace the pan on the stove, add 2 tablespoons oil and the
  onions. Cover and cook until soft, about 7 minutes. Uncover, increase heat
  to high and cook, stirring often until onions begin to dry out and turn a
  light golden color, another 10 minutes or so. Remove from the heat, scrape
  the onions into a bowl and set aside. Stuff a cheese slice and a bacon
  rasher in each loaf of bread. Using the handle of a large wooden spoon,
  stuff in the meat and onions. Choose a skillet or roasting pan large enough
  to hold 4 sandwiches and choose a flat cover that is smaller than the pan.
  Heat half the remaining oil over low heat, place the sandwiches in the
  skillet with the cover on top of the sandwiches. Place a 2-pound weight on
  the cover and cook for about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, turn the
  sandwiches and add the remaining oil. Replace the cover and press down with
  the weights. Cook another 5 minutes. Remove the sandwiches from the heat
  and keep warm in a 250F oven while you cook the remaining 2 sandwiches. To
  serve, cut each sandwich in half, then diagonally cut each half into
  triangular pieces.

  and any juices that have escaped from the pork. Cook, stirring, until the
  gravy thickens. To serve, cut the loin into individual chops and arrange on
  a serving platter. Strain the gravy through a sieve or strainer into a
  sauceboat and serve on the side.

    1/2 tb Finely minced garlic                2 tb Unsalted butter
 
  PEEL THE ONIONS, roughly dice them and set aside. Remove and discard celery
  root tops. Using a paring knife, peel and discard the thick black outer
  layer. Cut the celery root into pieces large enough to fit in the hopper of
  a food processor. Fit with a shredding blade and shred the celery root.
  Combine onion and celery root in a heavy pot. Cover onion and celery root
  and place over low heat. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove
  cover and cook, stirring, another 10 minutes or so or until the mixture is
  dry. Keep warm while preparing the rest of the recipe. Place mushrooms,
  shallots and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor and puree until smooth.
  Scrape this mixture into a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook,
  uncovered, stirring, until the moisture has evaporated and the mixture is
  dry. Remove from the heat and hold in a hot oven until salmon is done.
  Preheat the broiler. Butter a 9-inch baking dish. While mushroom mixture is
  cooking, combine the wine, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt in another medium
  saucepan over medium heat. Cook, uncovered, until reduced by half. Add the
  fish stock and reduce again until the mixture starts to thicken. Add cream
  and reduce until sauce will coat the back of a spoon. Scrape into a
  blender, add the parsley and blend until smooth. Replace in saucepan. Place
  the salmon in the baking dish and coat the surface with melted butter.
  Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and place under broiler for 5 minutes.
  Replace parsley cream over medium heat on top of the stove and whisk in the
  unsalted butter. To serve, place dollops of celery root and mushroom puree
  on a warm plate. Lay a piece of salmon on top between the 2 and spoon some
  sauce over the top.

      Title: Tender Cooker Chuck Roast
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 tb Oil                               1/4 ts Pepper
      3 lb Chuck roast                         1    Onion, cut up
    1/2 c  Water                               3    Potatoes, cut up
      1    Garlic clove, chopped               1 tb Flour
    1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  Heat oil in medium sized skillet, sear meat on all sides; place meat in
  Tender Cooker.  Add water, garlic, salt and pepper to skillet. Heat and
  scrape off any browned meat; pour mixture over meat. Arrange onion and
  potato on top of meat.  Place a single 7" circle of foil on top of food.
  Cover and add regulator guage, microwave on high 30 minutes. Let pressure
  indicator drop, remove cover. Remove meat and vegies, add flour mixed with
  a little water, stir, microwave, uncovered, stir once, to thicken juices.
  (a 400-500 w oven needs an increase of time of 6 min.)
  
  That is their recipe - I don't do any of the above.  My roast is usually
  one with a lot less fat in in (as little as I can manage when I cut a big
  piece of meat into roast, steak and stew meat) and is almost always still
  frozen and so I don't brown it first.  I put the meat and water in the
  cooker, cover and cook on high 20 minutes. When the indicator drops, I add
  potatoes, onion, carrots, and such seasoning as I want at the time, rinse
  the rubber ring, replace ring, recover (with pressure cap) and micro on
  high for 10 minutes. Let pressure drop, thicken juices and enjoy!

     1) Place the flour, yeast, salt, and ground cumin in a large mixing
  bowl.  Blend well.  Add the water and mix the dough for 2-3 minutes, until
  all the water is absorbed and evenly distributed.  The dough will be damp
  and very sticky, but no internal dry areas should appear by the end of the
  mixing.  If they do, mix a few minutes more, or add a little more water and
  mix again.
  
     2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsps. flour over
  the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured surface for
  5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and only slightly
  sticky.  Add more flour if needed (e.g. in humid weather).  Let the dough
  rest for 2 minutes more.
  
     3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle.  Knead 30
  seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
  towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
  hours; the dough should almost triple in size.
  
     4) Flour the top of the dough lightly, punch it down, and remove the
  dough from the mixing bowl.  Form the dough into a rectangular loaf and
  place in a well greasad loaf pan, 9-1/4 in. by 5-1/4 in. by 2-3/4 in. Cover
  with a towel and let rise 1 hr., until nicely risen.
  
     5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until browned on
  top; the bottom of the bread should sound hollow when tapped with the
  finger.  Let the bread cool, then serve.

      Title: Cato's Cheese Bread (Libum)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 c  Feta cheese, drained,                    Flour
           Crumbled, and packed into           1    Egg, beaten
           The measuring cup                   6    Bay leaves
    1/2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose             2 tb Honey
 
     1) Put the cheese into a medium sized mixing bowl.  Mash well with the
  fingers until it becomes a smooth, lumpless paste.  Add the flour and mix
  well with the fingers.  Add the beaten egg and mix well.  The dough will be
  rather sticky.
  
     2) Divide the dough into two equal parts, then form two round, flat, 1/2
  inch thick loaves.  Lay each on three bay leaves set on a greased baking
  sheet, and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, or
  until cooked through.
  
     3) Remove the loaves from the oven, spread the tops with the honey, and
  let cool.  Remove the bay leaves before serving. NOTE: If feta cheese is
  unavailable, use 1 cup cottage cheese and add 1/4 cup extra flour (but the
  taste is inferior).

      Title: Cato's Grape Bread (Mustaceus)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 c  Unbleached, all-purpose             1 ts Cumin seed, ground
           Flour                               1 ts Anise, ground
    1/2 c  Lard, shortening, or butter     1 1/2 c  Grape juice, purple or white
           Melted and cooled                   1 pk Dry yeast
    1/4 c  Feta cheese, crumbled and           8    Bay leaves
           Mashed into a paste            
 
     1) Place the flour, lard, mashed cheese, ground cumin and anise, and
  yeast in a large mixing bowl.  Blend well.  Add the grape juice and mix the
  dough well for 2-3 minutes until all the grape juice is absorbed and evenly
  distributed.  The dough will be damp and sticky, but no internal dry areas
  should appear by the end of the mixing.  If they do, mix a few minutes more
  or add a little more grape juice and mix again.
  
     2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsp. flour over
  the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured surface for
  5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and only slightly
  sticky.  Add more flour if needed.  Let the dough rest 2 minutes.
  
     3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle.  Knead 30
  seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
  towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
  hours.
  
     4) Sprinkle top with flour, punch down, and form the dough into 4
  rectangular loaves (4 in. by 2 in. by 2-1/2 in.).  Place two bay leaves on
  the bottom of each loaf, and lay them, leaf side down, on a greased cookie
  sheet.  Cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour, until well risen.
  
     5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until the loaves
  are brown on top and make a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom. Serve
  when cool. NOTE: To make these breads without leavening, omit the yeast,
  knead the dough thoroughly, then bake at 350 degrees for about 2 hours.
  They will be chewy and moist, and very foreign to our taste. The Romans
  thought unleaven bread was manlier and much better for the digestion.

  NOTE:  Lightly toasted sesame seeds may be substituted for the walnuts. To
  make moretum more authentically, use only two lettuce leaves; place them
  and the remaining green ingredients into a blender and blend well. Transfer
  to a mixing bowl, and add the cheese and ground pepper.  Form into a ball.
  Add the vinegar and oil in sparing amounts.

    1/2 lb Chicken livers                           Salt and pepper
    3/4 c  Olive oil                      
 
     1) Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a frying pan and gently saute the
  chicken livers for 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked through.
  
     2) Remove the cooked livers, place in a mixing bowl, and mash well with
  a fork (or use a blender).  Add another 1/4 cup of the oil, salt and pepper
  to taste, and mix well with the liver.
  
     3) Place the chopped liver in a serving dish and shape it into the
  likeness of a fish.  Pour the remaining 1/4 cup oil on top of the fish.
  Serve. NOTE: Liquamen (recipe posted earlier) may be used in addition to or
  in place of the salt. Apicius' recipe calls for a fish mold; if you have a
  fish-shaped gelatin mold, you could not be more authentic.  If it is a
  large one, however, you may have to double the recipe.

  1 1/4 ts Onion powder                        2 tb Brown sugar

  1 1/4 ts Garlic powder                            Liquid mesquite smoke *
 
  * use in place of smoker.
  
  Mix all ingredients except beef to make marinade.  Cut thinly sliced beef
  into 1/2 inch strips and marinate for 8 to 12 hours. Smoke using mesquite
  chips for about three hours and then finish drying in oven. If doing whole
  operation in oven use liquid smoke and hang strips of beef on highest rack
  and put shallow pan underneath to catch drippings. Turn oven on and set to
  lowest possible setting and leave for 6 to 8 hours until thoroughly dried.
  A couple of hints that I picked up from one of the cooking echos. Use
  toothpicks or wooden skewers to hang meat by, and put a couple of layers of
  paper towels in the pan to collect the drippings and save cleaning problems
  later on.

           Pepper, to taste                  1/4 ts Nutmeg
           Tabasco, to taste                   1    Egg, lightly beaten
      2 tb Bread crumbs                        2 tb Parmesan cheese
 
  1.  Preheat oven to 425 deg. 2. Peel the eggplant and cut the flesh into 1"
  cubes, more or less.  Drop the cubes into boiling salted water, cook about
  5 minutes, just until cooked. Drain well. 3. Meanwhile, slice the
  mushrooms.  There should be about 2 cups.  Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a
  skillet and add the mushroom slices.  Sprinkle with salt and about 1
  teaspoon lemon juice.  Cook, stirring and tossing, until the mushrooms give
  up their juice.  Continue cooking until the liquid evaporates. Set aside.

      Title: Green Corn Tamales
 Categories: Mexican
      Yield: 24 servings
 
     12    Ears of fresh white or            1/2 c  (scant) sugar
           Yellow corn                       1/4 c  Light cream, or more
      1 lb Monterrey Jack cheese,              2    Green chiles, parched and
           Grated                                   Peeled
      1 lb Pure lard                           1 lb Cheddar or Longhorn cheese
    1/2 lb Butter                                   Salt
 
     1.  Chop stalk end of each ear of corn flush with the base of the ear.
  Shuck, being careful to keep corn husks intact for later use. Wash husks,
  and drain.
  
     2.  Cut corn off cobs.  Grind corn with the Jack cheese in a meat
  grinder, blender or food processor.
  
     3.  Cream lard and butter to a smooth and fluffy consistency with an
  electric mixer at medium speed.  Add the ground corn and cheese mixture,
  sugar, cream and salt to taste.  Continue to mix with the electric mixer
  until mixture looks like whipped cream. Add more cream if mixture is dry.
  
     4.  Cut the roasted green chiles into long strips.  Spread about 2
  tablespoons of the corn mixture on each corn husk.  Spread mixture out into
  a rectangle and allow at least 2 inches of husk to extend below the corn
  mixture and a few inches of margin on both sides of the husk. Place about 2
  strips of green chile down the center of the corn mixture, then sprinkle
  with a few pinches of the grated Cheddar cheese.
  
     5.  Hold the two sides of the tamale together to make the corn mixture
  fold up around the filling.  Then tuck one edge of the husk over the top of
  the tamale and roll, tying the ends with strips of corn husks. If
  preferred, the bottom end of the husk can be folded up before rolling. If
  you plan to freeze the tamales, freeze them at this point.
  
     6.  Place the tamales upright on a rack in a pressure cooker or large
  steaming kettle.  Before the rack is completely filled with tamales, pour 1
  to 2 cups water into the bottom of the pan, about 1/2 inch deep.
  
     7.  Steam at 15 lbs pressure for 25 minutes, or in a conventional
  steamer for 45 minutes.  Serve warm with Green Chile Sauce, plain, or with
  beef, pork or chicken added.  These may be kept in the refrigerator for 3
  to 4 days.
  
  Makes 24 tamales.
  
  Freezing Hint:  Package tamales in plastic bags, 12 per package
                  or other suitable quantity.  If packaging large
                  quantities, keep track of the contents on a
                  card. Maximum Recommended Freezer Storage: 1 year

      1 ts Cayenne pepper                      2 ts Sweet paprika
      1 c  Unsalted chicken stock              1 c  Onions finely diced
      4    Ears yellow corn, shucked,          3 c  Milk
           Sliced into 1-inch thick            2 lg Yucca peeled and cut into
           Wheels                                   Inch thick dice.
      3 lb Chicken, cut into bite size              Juice of one lime.
 
  This recipe is for a Cuban stew/soup that I used to enjoy con mucho gusto.
  This version of Ajiaco was prepared by Senora Garcia in her little store
  front restaurant on Collins Ave. in Miami Beach.  Although this is not her
  exact recipe, it's the closest I could get to it. Ajico del Restaurant
  Garcia ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Melt the butter in a 6 qt. pot over
  medium heat.  Cook chicken pieces in the butter until no longer pink.
  Remove chicken with slotted spoon and place in in a bowl. Put onion,
  garlic, cayenne, and paprika in pot and cook while stirring, until onion is
  translucent and colored with the paprika.  Add stock, milk, yuca, corn, and
  chicken to the pot.  Bring almost to a boil then reduce heat, cover and
  simmer, stirring every now and then, for about 1 hour, or until yucca is
  tender.  Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve with Cuban or
  French bread that has been sliced and broiled until golden.
  
  As an alternative frozen corn on the cob will work, as well as fresh frozen
  kernels.  The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to this dish.
  
  If you're wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick 'em up
  with your fingers and nibble 'round the rims.
  
  This dish recieved rave reviews at the 1991 Blind Pass Marina Xmas Party.

      Title: Ginger-Banana Chutney
 Categories: Relishes, Preserve
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Onions, chopped                   1/2 lb Raisins, chopped
      6    Ripe bananas, put through a         2 c  Fresh or unsweetened canned
           Food mill                                Pineapple juice
    3/4 lb Pitted dates, chopped               1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar                       2 ts Curry powder
    1/4 lb Crystallized ginger, minced    
 
  Most people think of Trinidad, Guyana, and Martinique when they think of
  East Indian influences on Caribbean cooking. Jamaica, however, has had its
  share of that influence as well, as proved by this chutney that is prepared
  from bananas and ginger. Makes about 3 1/2 cups. Place the onions, bananas,
  dates, and vinegar in a nonreactive saucepan. Stir them to mix well and
  cook over low heat for 20 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and stir
  to make sure they are well combined. Continue to cook until the chutney has
  a jamlike consistency. Remove from the heat and place in sterilized jars.
  This chutney can accompany cold meats, grilled meats and, of course,
  curries. It will keep for 3 weeks in the refrigerator.

  over crumbs and 1/5 of the cheese filling over meat. Place 1 pastry sheet
  over cheese filling, crinkling to fit inside dimensions of pan; brush with
  butter and layer with 1/5 of the meat and 1/5 to the cheese fillings.
  Repeat with 3 more pastry sheets, crinkling each, brushing with butter and
  topping with fillings. Turn bottom pastry ends up over filling. Place

  Using spatula, tuck top pastry sheets around inside edges of pan. With
  sharp knife, score top lightly in half lengthwise and sixths crosswise. (Do
  not cut through.) Bake in moderate oven (350 degrees F.) 1 hour or until
  top is golden brown. Cool at least 10 minutes before cutting along scored
  lines. Place a cherry tomato on each of 12 small wooden picks and insert
  pick in center of each serving. Garnish with parsley. Garnish individual

      Title: Bubba's Fajitas
 Categories: Mexican, Beef
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Beef skirt steak                         Rings
      1 cl Garlic, chopped                          Juice from 1 large lime
      1 ts Cumin                                    Pepper to taste.
      1 tb Chopped fresh cilantro                   Green and yellow peppers
    1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce                     Guacamole
    1/4 c  Soy sauce                                Refried beans
      1 ts Liquid Smoke                             Mexican rice
      1 md Yellow onion, sliced in                  Warm flour tortillas
 
  Those self-appointed guardians of Texas cuisine, Bubba & Billy Joe, stopped
  by the other day and saw a request for fajitas so Bubba asked me to post
  his version.  Serves 4 regular people or two hungry Texans.
  
   Trim fat from steak. Pound lightly to tenderize. Place meat in
  non-metallic container. Top with onion rings. Combine remaining
  ingredients. Pour over meat and onions. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
  (At this point he says to go out and just party, party, party -- just
  forget about these tasty fajitas 'til tomorrow.) Next day - or whenever you
  find your way back home, remove the meat and onions, reserving the
  marinade. Separate the meat and onions. Place meat on grill, basting often
  with the marinade and turning often to prevent charring. You gotta do this
  on a grill - it's not the same in a broiler. Meanwhile, saute the onions in
  butter with some green and maybe some yellow peppers sliced into strips.
  When the meat's done, slice it into thin strips, cutting across the grain.
   Serve with homemade refried beans, Mexican rice, guacamole, picante sauce
  or salsa, sour cream, grated cheddar, your sauteed veggies and of course,
  warm flour tortillas to hold it all together. Bubba uses handmade tortillas
  he gets from a nearby restaurant. They're much better than store bought.
  (Hint: I think this recipe is even better with chicken, but don't tell
  Bubba I said that, 'cause he thinks real men eat beef, and only sissies eat
  chicken!)
  
  Thanks again Bill, Bubba and Billy Joe.

      Title: Woodruff Special
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Slices bacon                        1 qt Spaghetti sauce
           Cabbage leaves (1/4 head)           1 lb Chopped beef
      1 md Onion, chopped                    1/2 ts Oregano
      2 c  Rice, cooked                             Garlic salt to taste
      1 cn Sauerkraut (large can, well              Salt and pepper to taste
           Drained)                       
 
  DIRECTIONS Fry the bacon fairly crisp and reserve it. Use the bacon fat to
  grease a pan or casserole (a 10" x 12" x 2" pan is just about right for
  this recipe). Tear cabbage leaves as necessary to line the bottom of the
  pan, about 2-3 leaves thick. Break up the chopped beef and crumble on top
  of the cabbage leaves. Crumble the bacon pieces on top of the beef. Add the
  chopped onion, and then add salt, pepper, garlic salt and oregano. Cover
  this with the cooked rice and then the sauerkraut. Cover with another layer
  of cabbage leaves, about 2-3 leaves thick. Finally, pour the spaghetti
  sauce on top, distributing it evenly.
   Bake, covered at 325 degrees for 3-4 hours.

      Title: Turkey and Rocket Salad with Macadamias
 Categories: Salads, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Bunch of rocket, discarding              Salt & pepper to taste
           The coarse stem ends              100 ml Macadamia oil
      1 sm Soft lettuce                       50 ml White wine vinegar
    250 g  Macadamia nuts                      1 lb Turkey, sliced
      2 cl Garlic, chopped                          Chives
 
      Turkey meat, which tends to be dry, benefits particularly from this
  macadamia dressing, but any roast poultry meat you have left over can be
  used instead. Another soft lettuce can stand in for the rocket (arugula) if
  you simply can't obtain the latter, but it won't provide the delicate,
  savoury flavour. Macadamia oil can now be obtained in some supermarkets.
      Arrange the leaves on four plates.
  
      Heat 250 g macadamia nuts in an ungreased container in the oven until
  they smell appetizing, then set half aside and tip the other half into the
  bowl of a food processor. Add: 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped. With salt
  and pepper process to a paste.
   With the food processor.running, slowly add 100 ml macadamia oil, then 50
  ml white wine vinegar.
  
      Slice or shred enough turkey for four people and gently loss it in the
  macadamia salad.
  
      Arrange the dressed turkey on the prepared plates, drizzle left-over
  dressing over the salad leaves, Sprinkle with reserved macadamia nuts,
  roughly chopped, and finely chopped chives. Serve.

     A few extra chillies would give this salad a lot more punch.

  parings into a stock pot and fill with water.  Add garlic cloves.  Fill the
  stock pot with water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and let
  it cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.  Remove from heat to cool cover
  and refrigerate overnight.  The next day remove the congealed fat from the
  top of the broth.  Drain the contents through a collander into another
  large pot.  Return the broth to the stock pot.  Go through the collander
  and remove vegetable & garlic pieces and discard.  Next, go through the
  turkey remnants and pull out all the meat and add to the stock pot. Add any
  left over vegetables, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and the onion to
  the pot.  There should be *just* enough liquid to cover the contents. Place
  over heat and bring to a boil.  While you're waiting, cook the egg noodles
  per package directions and drain.  Simmer the soup just long enough to cook
  the carrots.  Add 2 quarts of water, egg noodles and left over gravy.
  Adjust seasonings (salt & pepper).  Stir well, let simmer long enough to
  heat noodles and serve.

  Contributed to the echo by: Dan Perez Dan's Spicy Smoked Spareribs To get
  started, place a handful of hickory or mesquite chips into cold water and
  set aside. Parboil rib sections in boiling water for about ten minutes.
  (This partially cooks them and renders much of the fat.) Remove rib
  sections and set on wire rack to cool. Combine dry ingredients in a bowl
  and blend well with a fork. When rib sections are cool, rub the dry
  ingredient mixture into the meat. Stack rib sections, seal in aluminum foil
  and let them sit in the refrigerator for about two hours.
  
  After two hours, start the coals in your smoker. Combine ingredients for
  basting sauce in a blender and blend until smooth. Transfer the basting
  sauce to a saucepan and heat over low heat until it begins to bubble. If
  you prefer for the basting sauce to be thicker, mix 2 tablespoons of
  cornstarch with 1/4 cup of cold water, and mix a little of the cornstarch
  mixture into the basting sauce a bit at a time to until desired consistency
  is achieved.
  
  When the coals are uniform gray, scatter a few of the wet wood chips over
  them. Rub grill with a paper towel dipped in vegetable oil. Brush ribs with
  basting sauce and place them on the grill. Cover with smoker lid (leave
  vents about half-open). Grill the ribs for about an hour, turning about
  every fifteen minutes and basting as you turn them. Add wood chips to the
  coals as necessary to maintain smoke.
  
  Serve ribs with warm basting sauce.

  Contributed to the echo by: Michael Gallagher Bob, here is my variation of
  a chili recipe with beans in it. If the people here don't like beans with
  their chili, I'll give a substitution. DON'T change anything, for this is
  the way you should make authentic Texas chili--not the cheap imitation
  stuff.
  
  Wash beans in colander and soak overnight. Wash again next day, and place
  in large chili pot. Cover with water about 1/2 to 3/4 inch over beans;
  simmer, covered, for about 2-1/2 hours or until done.
  
  If substituting beans with the lean beef sirloin, brown the meat 1 pound at
  a time, preferably in a non-stick skillet without any oil. Place the meat
  in large chili pot. You will also need 1 more 12 ounce can of tomato sauce
  and 1 to 2 10 ounce cans of fat-skimmed beef stock. You will add the extra
  can of tomato sauce and the can of beef stock in the next paragraph of
  directions.
  
  Brown meat and place in large saucepan. Add all of the other ingredients
  and spices. Mix well. Simmer, covered, for 1 hour. When beans are done, add
  contents of saucepan to chili pot and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Makes 15
  to 20 servings, 225 calories each (205 with out the oil). Salt and pepper
  to taste.

      Title: Tamale Instructions
 Categories: Mexican
      Yield: 50 servings
 
      2 pk Dried cornhusks                          Warm water
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Leti Labell Prepare the corn husks: First go
  through the corn husks, separating them, and removing pieces of cornsilk
  (and also dirt, etc.) that you find. Then place them in a large bowl and
  cover with tap water. (I put several plates on top of the corn husks to
  hold them down, because they have a tendency to float.) Let them soak for
  at least half an hour. Rinse the corn husks several times, to clean them.
  Then drain them well. Next, dry off the corn husks. While you do this, you
  can separate them into piles: big husks, medium, and too little to be worth
  using. At this time, you can also prepare some thin strips of corn husk,
  that you will use to tie the tamales together. (This is where you you the
  little pieces too small to make a tamale.) (I found that the pieces weren't
  long enogh to tie around the tamales, so I tied two shorter pieces of thin
  husk together. More on this later.) Make the tamales: Hold a large corn
  husk in your hand, with the narrow end pointing to the right. Take a
  spoonful of dough (I used a serving spoon, about 2 Tbs or so) and spread it
  on the corn husk, about 1-1/2 inches from the wide end, and about 4 inches
  from the narrow end. Spread the dough right up to the edge of the corn husk
  on one side, leaving enough of a flap to wrap around the tamale. (If the
  husk isn't wide enough for you to be able to wrap it around, you'll use
  another husk - more on this later.) Next, spread a spoonful (again, about 2
  Tbs) of filling down the middle of the dough. Roll the sides of the corn
  husk in toward the center, bringing the edges of the dough together,
  enclosing the filling. Wrap the rest of the corn husk around to the back.
  If there is not enough husk to wrap around to the back, place another corn
  husk around the tamale, to hold the edge closed. Now, wrap the top (broad
  end) edge down, and flip the bottom part (the narrow end) up, so that it
  covers the edge of the broad end. Then, using the thin strips of corn husk,
  tie across the middle to hold the top and bottom flaps in place. Steaming
  the tamales: Stand the tamales on end in a steamer. If you don't have a
  steamer, you could put the tamales in a metal collander, and place the
  collander in a large pot. Just be sure that the tamales do not touch the
  water below. Bring the water to a brisk boil, and steam the tamales for at
  least an hour. I did it for an hour and 15 minutes. You can test one to see
  if they are done: the dough will easily separate from the husk. Just be
  careful - don't burn yourself on the steam! You can reheat tamales in the
  oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes. (Don't try to re-steam them.) If
  you freeze them, you can reheat them by putting the frozen tamales in a
  casserole dish, covering with foil, and heating in a 350 oven for 30-35
  minutes. This was a lot of work, but it was well worth it!

  Cooking Empanadas con Picadillo
  
  Sift the flour with a pinch of salt into a mixing bowl, or place in a food
  processor and mix once or twice. Rub in the margerine and shortening until
  the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, or work in the food processor,
  being careful not to over-mix. Mix the liquid gradually, adding enough to
  bring the pastry together into a ball. (In a food processor, add the liquid
  through the funnel while the motor is running.) Wrap the pastry well, and
  chill for 20 to 30 minutes.
  
  Brown the ground meat well, and drain away as much of the fat as possible.
  
  until the onion is soft. Add to the meat. Then add the cocoa, flour,
  spices, oregano, and seasonings. Stir well and cook briefly before adding
  the chilies and the tomatoes. Cook slowly for 10-15 minutes.
  
  Add the nuts and the olives, and allow to cool. (Oh, you were supposed to
  add the parsley with the tomatoes, above.)
  
  Roll out the pastry on a floured surface. (We didn't do this. We ran the
  dough through the pasta machine - much easier! We found the #3 setting on
  our Atlas pasta maker to be the right thickness.)
  
  Cut the dough into 4 inch rounds. (I used a leftover container from ricotta
  cheese to get the right size.)
  
  Place about 1-1/2 tablespoons of filling on the dough circle. Fold over,
  and press to seal. If the dough is a little dry, moisten the edges with a
  little warm water (with your finger) before pressing the edges together.
  Crimp the edges with a fork. With a toothpick, prick several holes on the
  top of the empanada to allow the steam to escape.
  
  Mix the glaze ingredients together. Place empanadas on a baking sheet, and
  brush with the egg glaze.
  
  Bake at 425 for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
  
  If you like, you can freeze these. To bake frozen empanadas, place the
  frozen pastries on a cooking sheet and brush with the egg glaze. Bake for
  30-35 minutes at 425 degrees.
  
  Makes 15 empanadas.

  buttermilk and lemon juice into a food processor with metal blade. Process
  until smooth (and I mean SMOOTH...can turn grainy unless you give it
  time...when you think it's done, process it some more.) When it's done, you
  have the option of blending in any of the powdered dressing mixes (we use
  3/4 package for flavor - more than that and you've reduced your fat intake
  and TRIPLED your sodium intake.) You need to pour the contents back into
  the cottage cheese container and let it set for an hour or so.

      Title: Spanish Hot Dogs and Rice
 Categories: Meats, Rice/grains, Spanish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 cn Stewed tomatoes.                  3/4 c  Green pepper, diced
    1/2 lb Hot dogs sliced 1/2"              3/4 c  Onion, diced
           Thick                                    Rice for 4 people
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Marge Clark The recipe has no real
  measurments...is a "what you have"... Spanish hot dogs & rice: Enough rice
  for four people... put rice on to cook...while it's cooking slice as many
  hot dogs as you have (lets say 1/2 pound or more) into pennies, about 1/2
  inch thick. dice 1 green pepper...I used to use the frozen diced pepper and
  use a couple of handsful..maybe 3/4 cup? Diced onion. ditto on the amount.
  combine all the above, heat, while the rice is cooking...set the table and
  spray on some perfume.
  
  This is obviously not a gourmet feast for company. But everyone ATE it! and
  there is little that's faster or easier!

  2. Add the chick peas and season with the salt and pepper. Leave to cool

     rub into the flour with your hands until the mixture is like bread-
     crumbs.
  
  2. Add the cold water and press the mixture together to form a dough.
     Turn out onto a floured board and divide into 2 equal pieces.
  
  3. Take out one piece of the dough and knead lightly, pressing it into a
     round shape.
  
  4. Roll it into a circle about 15cm across. Put 1/2 of the vegetable
     mixture on top and fold into a pasty type shape and press the edges
     together.
  
  5. Pierce a couple of holes in the top and bake for 20 minutes or until
     crisp.
  
  This recipe is also nice with filo pastry, or the samosa packets you can
  buy. If you use filo pastry remember to brush the outside with some melted
  margerine or butter to prevent sticking.

      Title: Breakfast Pizza
 Categories: Breakfast, Italian, Pizza
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8 oz Mozzarella Cheese, grated         1/4 md Onion, chopped
      6    Eggs                              3/4 md Onion, from above, ringed
  1 1/2 c  Milk and/or cream                   1 md Green pepper, ringed
           Salt and Pepper, to taste           1    Pizza crust
 
  Prepare your favorite pizza crust and get ready to bake, as a regular
  pizza.  Make sure that you have a fairly high ridge, as the there is a lot
  of mixture, and it is fairly watery. Pugliese bread dough works very well
  for a crust.
  
  Beat eggs lightly.  Add cheese, onion and salt and pepper.  Mix gently.
  
  Lightly brush olive oil over the pizza base.  Pour mixture over the crust.
  Place rings of green pepper over the top.  You can also include onion
  rings, mushrooms, or other favorite Pizza toppings.  Color contrast helps
  here, as the mixture is rather plain looking.
  
  Bake at 450 degrees for about 15-20 mins, or when crust is brown and egg
  mixture is set.
  
  I got the recipe from a TV show about how to make Pizzas, on PBS. People
  that won't eat Pizza or Eggs with even go for this!

      Title: Danish Pastry
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4    To 6 cups flour                   1/4 ts Ground cardamom seeds
      2 pk Dry yeast or 1 ounce fresh               -(optional)
           -yeast                              1 ts Vanilla
      3 tb Sugar                           1 1/4 c  Cold milk (approximately)
      1 ts Salt                                2 c  Butter, firm, but not ice
      3    Whole eggs or 6 egg yolks                -cold
      1 ts Grated orange rind             
 
  When making Danish pastry it is important to keep the dough very cold. In
  shaping small pastries, it is sometimes necessary to re-chill partially
  shaped dough until it is firm enough for the job to be completed. When you
  first make the pastry, be careful to follow all the rules. Don't make it in
  the summertime unless your kitchen is air conditioned. After you gain
  experience you may attempt short cuts such as rolling out and folding the
  dough twice in succession without re-chilling. Another way of shortening
  the process is by placing the dough in the freezer between rollings.
  Usually 10 minutes in the freezer is suffiecient. When you use this short
  cut, be careful not to freeze the dough solid. The shaped pastries can also
  be chilled in the freezer. They can even be baked frozen if extra baking
  time is allowed. Any unbaked yeast pastries, however, should never be kept
  frozen for more than a week or so; and it is preferable to bake anish
  pastry within a day or two after it has been shaped.
  
  Place 4 cups flour in large bowl.  Reserve remaining flour for rolling.
  Make a well in center of bowl.
  
  If dry yeast is used, see directions on package.  If fresh yeast is used,
  cream it with sugar and salt to make a syrup.  Add egg yolks or whole eggs,
  grated orange rind, ground cardamom seeds, and vanilla.
  
  Pour yeast mixture into well.  Add one cup milk and 1/4 cup butter cut into
  pieces.  Mix with finger tips, adding more milk if necessary to make a
  medium-soft dough.  Knead dough in bowl for 5 minutes, or until it is
  smooth but not elastic.  Flour it and let rest in refrigerator for 30
  minutes.
  
  While dough is resting, form remaining butter into a flattened brick. Using
  some of the reserved flour on wax paper or pastry cloth, roll out butter
  into a square about 1/3 inch thick.  Use plenty of flour under and on top
  of butter to keep it from sticking.  Loosen it frequently as you rol. Cut
  the square in 2 pieces.  Place in refrigerator between sheets of wax paper.
  
  Roll out dough on well-floured cloth to make a rectangle 3 times longer
  than wide and about 1/3 inch thick.  Brush excess flour from dough. Place a
  piece of butter in center.  Fold one end of dough over butter. Place
  remaining butter on top.  Fold second end over the butter.  Press edges
  together.
  
  Turn dough, changing its position so that the short ends are parallel with
  the edge of table nearest you.  Roll out on well-floured cloth, using a
  firm, even motion to spread butter together with dough.  Try to work
  quickly, but check frequently underneat the dough to be sure it isn't
  sticking.  Roll out a rectangele 3 times longer than wide, about 1/3 inch
  thick.  rush excess flour from surface.  Fold both ends of dough to meet in
  center.  Press edges together, then fold in half as if closing a book,
  which will make 4 layers of dough.  Flour dough.  Place on a cooky sheet.
  Cover with aluminum foil.  Refrigerate for 1/2 hour.
  
  Repeat rolling and folding dough 3 more times, chilling it 20 minutes
  between rollings.  Be sure to change position of dough each time so that
  the short ends of dough are parallel with the edge of the table nearest you
  when you start rolling.
  
  After the final folding, chill dough at least 3 hours before shaping and
  baking.

      1 c  Chopped shrimp                      1 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Ground pork                         1 ts Salt
 
  Boil wrapper. Remove from heat and pour in 1 1/2 cup flour and beat until
  it forms a ball.  Divide into 1 1/4 inch balls and roll each until paper
  thin.  Spoon 1 tbls. mixture into each wrapper, fold and seal. Arrange in
  steamer and steam 30 minutes.
  
       Again some expanation... these can be made with much thicker wrappers
  (the ones the street vendors sell are more like 1/2 to 1 inch thick) and
  the filling can be just about anything.  I have done these with leftover
  meat and a few vegetables ... such as mushrooms, celery etc.

      6    Dried Chinese black                      Sherry
           Mushrooms                       1 1/2 ts Light soy sauce
      6 oz Shrimp, shelled & deveined          2 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Salt                                2 tb Chicken stock
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil                          2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
      6 oz Ground pork butt                         Coriander leaves
    1/4 c  Finely diced bamboo shoots          1    Oil
    1/4 c  Finely diced water                       Wheat Starch Wrappers
           Chestnuts, preferably fresh              (see recipe)
      2    Green onions, chopped                    Light soy sauce, for
      2 ts Sugar                                    Dipping
    1/4 ts White pepper                             Chinese mustard, for
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry              Dipping
 
  can be prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before
  serving.  The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture, a
  unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors.  Roll out the
  wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.
  
       Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and
  pliable.  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms.  Cut off
  the stems at the base and discard them.  Finely mince the caps.
  
       Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes.  Rinse well
  with cold water, pat dry thoroughly.  Coarsely mince.
  
       Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium-
  high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water
  chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.
  Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce.  Combine the
  cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour
  into wok.  Stir fry for 1 minute longer.  Remove the mixture to a shallow
  plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander.  Allow the
  filling to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
       Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of
  dough.  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle.
  An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press
  or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of
  the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling
  inside.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
  
       Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate).  Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes.  Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve
  with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

      Title: Wheat Starch Wrappers for Dumplings
 Categories: Chinese
      Yield: 30 servings
 
      1 c  Wheat starch                        1 tb Peanut oil plus more to oil
    1/4 c  Tapioca starch                           The wrappers
      1 c  Boiling water                  
 
       Combine the wheat starch and tapioca starch in a mixing bowl.  When
  the water reaches a boil immediately pour it into the flour and stir
  vigorously into a ball, with a wooden spoon.  The hot boiling water cooks
  the starches.  Add the oil to the dough and mix together as well as
  possible.  The dough at this point is quite thick and lumpy.
  
       While hot, gather up the dough and knead on a lightly oiled surface
  until smooth and well blended, about 3 minutes.  It should feel a bit
  rubbery and putty-like.  Cover with a damp towel.
  
       Dough is ready to make Ha Gow or Fun Gwau.
  
  Makes enough dough for 2 1/2 dozen Ha Gow or Fun Gwau dumplings.

      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose              2 c  Hot (120F to 130F) water
           Flour, divided                      1 c  Lukewarm (100F) water
      1 ts Active dry yeast                         SOURDOUGH STARTER
 
  Yield : Approximately 4 cups Difficulty: (one chocolate kiss, or easy)
  Prepartion: 10 minutes Allow at least 4 days for the starter to ferment
  before using. "Day 1: 1. In a medium bowl, stir together 2 cups of the
  flour and yeast.  Make a well in the middle of the flour/yeast mixture and
  whisk in the hot water. Continue stirring until the mixture is blended but
  not completely smooth. It is not necessary to smooth out all the lumps;
  they will dissolve as the mixture start to ferment. Cover the bowl with a
  clean towel and let the mixture sit at room temperature. Over the next 24
  hours the mixture will rise, become very bubbly and then start to recede.
  
  "Days 2 and 3: 2. Stir the mixture twice, once in the morning and once in
  the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol. Towards the
  end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and the surface of the
  starter will be covered with lots of tiny air bubbles. By the evening of
  the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown liquid may form on the surface
  of the starter. It is simply the alcohol given off by the yeast cells as
  they feed on the carbohydrates in the flour and multiply. Refresh the
  starter by stirring in the cup of lukewarm water (100F) and the remaining
  cup of flour. Stir until blended, but do not worry about any small lumps.
  
  "Day 4: 3. The starter is now ready to use, or it may be poured into a
  sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole, or a flass
  jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated.

    1/4 ts Baking soda                              Desired
 
  From Gourmet/May 1991 For the shortcakes
      Make the shortcakes:  In a bowl sift together the cocoa powder, the
  flour, the sugar, the baking powder, baking soda, and salt, add butter, and
  blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Add the cream and stir
  the mixture with a fork until it forms a dough.  Divide the dough in half,
  arrange each half in a mound on a lightly greased baking sheet, and bake
  the shortcakes in the middle of a 425 oven for 12 min., or until a tester
  inserted in the centers come out with crumbs clinging to it. Transfer to a
  rack to cool.
  
  In a bowl mash 3/4 cup of the raspberries with a fork, stir in 1 tbsp. of
  the granulated sugar and the framboise, stirring until the sugar is
  dissolved, and stir in the remaining 3/4 cup raspberries.  In a small bowl
  with an electric mixer beat the cream until it holds soft peaks, add the
  remaining 1 tbsp. granulated sugar, and beat the cream until it holds stiff
  peaks.  Cut the shortcakes in half.(The shortcakes are delicate and crumble
  easily.)  Top each bottom half with half the raspberry mixture, divide the
  whipped cream between the 2 shortcakes. With a spatula carefully top each
  serving with the top half of a shortcake. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar
  and garnish with mint. Serves: 2 Shared By: Pat Stockett

      Title: Cocada Imperial (Imperial Coconut Flan)
 Categories: Desserts, Mexican
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Milk                                     Pinch   salt
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar                         Flan mold coated with
      1    Small coconut                            Caramel
      5    Small eggs, separated          
 
       Preheat the oven to 450F.
  
       Place the sugar and milk in a heavy saucepan and melt the sugar over
  low heat, then raise the heat and boil the mixture briskly.  Take care that
  it does not boil over.  As soon as the mixture begins to thicken, stir it
  so that it does not stick to the bottom of the pan.  After about 30 minutes
  it should be the consistency of thin condensed milk and has been reduced to
  1 cup.  See Note.
  
       Pierce holes through two of the "eyes" of the coconut and drain the
  water from it.  Set the water aside.
  
       Put the whole coconut into the oven for about 8 minutes.  Crack it
  open; the flesh should come away quite easily from the shell.
  
       Pare the brown skin from the coconut flesh with a potato peeler. Grate
  the coconut finely.  You will need 2 1/4 cups, loosely packed, for the
  flan.
  
       Add the grated coconut to the reserved coconut water and boil it for
  about 5 minutes, stirring it constantly.
  
       Add the "condensed" milk and continue cooking for another 5 minutes.
  Set the mixture aside to cool.
  
       Beat the egg yolks together until they are creamy and stir them well
  into the coconut mixture.
  
       Beat the egg whites until they are frothy, add the salt and continue
  beating until they are stiff.  Fold them into the mixture.
  
       Pour the mixture into the prepared mold.  Cover the mold with a
  well-greased lid and place into a water bath.
  
       Cook the flan on the lowest shelf of the oven for about 1 1/2 hours,
  then test to see if it is done.  When it is done, set it aside to cool.
  
  Makes 6 servings.
  
  NOTES:
       Of course, you can substitute1 cup of lightly thinned canned,
  sweetened condensed milk for the milk and sugar and substitute pre-grated
  but unsweetened coconut.  Use milk instead of coconut water; the flavor
  will just not be quite as good.
  
       Do not think you have done something wrong when you see that the
  coconut and custard have separated.  That is how it is meant to be.  The
  caramel will nearly all have been absorbed by the spongy layer of coconut.
  
       If you are using fresh coconut there will almost certainly be some
  left over.  It will keep perfectly well if frozen.
  
       To test to see if the flan is cooked through, insert the blade of a
  knife or a skewer well into the flan.  The knife should come out clean.
  Take care not to pierce the flan at the bottom or it will spoil the
  appearance of the top when it is unmolded.

  NOTES:
       Do not overcrowd the fryer or saucepan when making these crab
  fritters.  Make no more than 5 fritters at a time.
       Be certain to slide the fritters gently into the hot oil. Dropping
  them into the oil can can cause a dangerous splash.
       Turn the fritters frequently as they fry, making sure that all sides
  are browned.
  
       Heat the oil in a small heavy skillet over medium heat.  add the
  garlic and saute for 1 minute.  Add the curry powder and stir for 1 minute.
  Transfer the mixture to a blender.  Add all of the remaining ingredients
  and blend until smooth.  Pour into a bowl.

      Title: Gingerbread Teddy Bears
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      1 c  Butter (or margarine)               1 ts Ginger
    2/3 c  Brown sugar                       1/2 ts Ground cloves
    2/3 c  Corn syrup and/or molasses        3/4 ts Baking soda
      4 c  Flour                               1    Egg; lightly beaten
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon                        1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
 
    In a saucepan combine butter, brown sugar and corn syrup. Cook and stir
    over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Pour into large mixing bowl; cool
    5 minutes. Sift together flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and baking soda.
    Add egg and vanilla to butter mixture; mix well. Add flour mixture; beat
    til well mixed. Divide dough in half, cover and chill 2 hours or
    overnight. For each bear, shape dough into one 1-inch ball, one 3/4-inch
    ball, six 1/2-inch balls and one 1/4-inch ball. On ungreased cookie sheet
    flatten the 1-inch ball to 1/2" thickness for body. Attach the 3/4-inch
    ball for head and flatten to 1/2" thickness. Attach the 1/2-inch balls
  for
    arms, legs and ears. Attach the 1/4-inch ball for nose. Bake at 350
    degrees for 8 to 10 minutes, cool and decorate. I usually make these
    smaller than described here; about 1/2 the size. Also, the ears start to
    look like MOUSE ears if they're not a little smaller than the arms and
    legs. Roll the nose ball to make it more oval in shape and place it on
  the
    LOWER half of the bear's face. These can be decorated with any icing-- I
    use tinted Royal icing made from meringue powder to add eyes, nose and
  bow
    tie to each bear. For Easter, make these into bunnies. Use only light
  corn
    syrup, no molasses. Substitute white sugar for the brown sugar. Omit
    spices and add a bit of almond extract if desired. Make them the same
  way,
    but make two long ears on the top and two cheek-balls instead of the
    nose-ball. Decorate with pastel icings.       Karen Mintzias TCVC49A

  Contributed to the echo by: Kathi Crockett Now, I'd better get a recipe in
  here before the troups kick me out. Here's a fun and very easy party recipe
  for candied nuts: CARMELED PEANUTS Beat egg white and water until frothy -
  not stiff. Add peanuts, stir until they are well coated. Combine sugar and
  salt then pour this over the nuts & eggwhite mixture. Bake at 225 on a
  greased, tinfoil lined cookie sheet. Stir every 15 minutes for 1 hour.
  
  This makes a nice, big batch and is delicious. You can also use other nuts.
  I first started doing this because I was always at a loss as to what to do
  with the leftover nuts from Christmas and this certainly takes care of them
  in short order. It's one of those recipes where you can't eat just one.

      Title: Chicken Piccata
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4    Chicken breasts *                   2    Fresh lemons **
    1/2    Cube of butter                      1    Small jar of capers
      4 tb Vegetable oil                            Small amount of salt
      1    Clove garlic, mashed                     Freshly ground pepper
    1/2 c  Chopped Italian parsley        
 
  * boned, skinned and pounded to 1\4" thick ** slice one thinly and squeeze
  the other of its juice
  ===========================================================================
  
     Cut boned, skinned, pounded chicken breasts into eight serving pieces (4
  chicken breasts will serve 6 people as it is better to have some leftover
  than not enough).  Melt butter in non-stick pan.  Add vegetable oil and
  heat till sizzling.  Quickly saute garlic in oil and remove piece of garlic
  before it gets brown or it will taste bitter.  Quickly saute over medium
  high heat the flattened chicken breasts.  Sprinkle with freshly ground
  black pepper and the juice of the one lemon.  (DO NOT SALT NOW.) When you
  turn the chicken breast portions, also place in pan the chopped Italian
  parsley and the thinly sliced lemon and let that saute briefly, too. The
  chicken will only take about a minute or so on each side so make sure
  everything else is ready.  Add drained jar of capers to the pan and swirl
  it in the oil/butter so everything is well coated with the garlic and lemon
  flavor.  Salt sparingly.
  
   To serve, place over a bed of rice, cous cous or fettucine on an oblong
  platter, overlapping portions of chicken piccata and drizzling the
  oil\butter\garlic\parsley and capers down the center of the chicken
  portions.  Yield: 6 servings

           No Ingredients                 
 
  To dress up dips in holiday style, serve them with festive flair. Leave
  your serving bowls on the shelf and try one of these fresh ideas.
  
  PARTY-PERFECT PEPPER POTS: Start with a large red, yellow or green pepper.
  Place the pepper on its side and cut a large slice from the top, forming an
  opening that's large enough to dip into easily. Remove the seeds and
  membranes and fill the pepper with your favorite dip.
  
  COLORFUL CABBAGE CUPS: Cut a thin slice off the stem end of a red or green
  cabbage so it will be upright. Using a small, sharp knife, cut a "bowl" in
  the top of the cabbage and tuck in a small glass bowl. Fill the bowl with
  your favorite. Save the cabbage you've removed for coleslaw, or toss it
  into a salad.
  
  BEAUTIFUL BREAD BOWL: Cut a thick slice off the top of a small round loaf
  of bread and hollow out the bread, leaving a 1/2-1" thick shell. Fill the
  bread bowl with your favorite dip. Cut the top slice and the bread you've
  removed from the inside into bite-size cubes to use as dippers. Works great
  with classic Pace Con Queso Dip.

  The following recipes are additional spreads that can be used in place of
  butter on the outside of bread/dough when making pockets.
  
  Mayo Spread: 1/4 cup real Mayonnaise; 1/4 tsp. onion powder; 1/4 tsp.
  celery salt.  Stir to combine.  Enough for 8 slices of bread. Mayo spread
  will enhance the flavor of most foods except sweets. Especially good on
  sandwiches with eggs, cheese, ham and seafood or vegetable pockets.
  
  Curried Mayonnaise: 1/4 cup mayonnaise; 1 tsp. mild Indian curry powder.
  Stir to combine - enough for 8 slices of bread.  Curry is a nice flavor
  accompaniment with beef, chicken, lamb, shrimp and vegetables.
  
  Maple butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/2 tsp. maple flavoring. Stir
  to combine. Enough for 8 slices. Use maple butter for pockets. Use with
  pork, ham or sweets.
  
  Vanilla butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Stir
  to combine - enough for 8 slices of bread.  Vanilla butter enhances flavor
  and has an enticing aroma while cooking.
  
  Almond Butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/4 tsp almond extract. Stir
  to combine - enough for 8 slices bread.  Use with fruit pie filling or
  other sweets.
  
  Herbed butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1/4 tsp herbs (combine
  basil, thyme, rosemary and tarragon).  Stir to combine. Spread on one side
  of 8 bread slices or other bread products used for pockets. This taste
  especially good with meats, cheese and vegetables.
  
  Garlic butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1 clove garlic, crushed.
  Stir to combine.  Enough for 8 bread slices.  Use with any eat or vegetable
  filling.
  
  Honey butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1 tblsp. honey. Stir to
  combine.  This is enough to spread 8 slices of bread. Because the honey
  promotes browning, use this on pockets which only have to brown and heat
  through.  If used on egg sandwiches,etc... the bread may over brown before
  the egg finishes cooking.
  
  Lemon butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; finely grated rind of 1
  lemon (about 1/2tsp.).  Stir to combine.  This is enough to spread 8 slices
  of bread.  The fresh lemon brings out the flavor of fruit filling and
  seafood fillings.

      6    Eggs                              1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Heavy cream, half-and-half          4 tb To 6 T clarified butter
           -or milk                            8 sl Challah, cut 1-inch thick
 
  Beat the eggs together with cream, half-and-half, or milk. Beat in cinnamon
  and salt. Melt the butter in a large frying pan. Dip the challah slices,
  one at a time, into the egg mixture, making sure that each slice is well
  coated. The challah should absorb a little of the egg mixture but not
  enough to get soggy. Fry each battered challah slice for 2-3 minutes on
  each side until they are golden brown. Don't fry too fast or the inside
  will be wet and gooey. Serve with your favorite jam, maple syrup, honey,
  cinnamon, sugar, or plain. NOTE: Heavy cream really is the best liquid to
  use in this recipe.

      Title: Biscotti Del Laggaccio (Aniseed Biscotti)
 Categories: Italian, Cookies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
-------------------------------FOR THE SPONGE-------------------------------
      1 pk Active dry yeast; 2 1/2 tsp       3/4 c  Flour;all purpose,
    1/2 c  -Warm water                              Unbleached

-------------------------------FOR THE DOUGH-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar                           2 1/2 c  Flour;all purpose,
    1/2 c  -Water &                                 Unbleached
      2 tb -Water                              1 tb Aniseed
    1/4 c  Butter; unsalted, 1/2 stick       1/2 ts -Salt
           -cut into bits & softened      
 
  "Did Columbus and his crews sail to the new world eating these traditional
  Ligurian biscotti? It's entirely possible, although theirs would have been
  cooked much longer to drive off all the moisture, allowing them to keep for
  an entire ocean crossing. Though these biscotti are made with an enriched
  bread dough instead of the traditional cookie dough and have a somewhat
  softer texture, they keep well when stored in an airtight container."
  
  Make the sponge: In the bowl of an electric mixer proof the yeast in the
  water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy. Whisk in the flour and
  let the sponge stand, covered with plastic wrap, for 30 minutes or until it
  is foamy.
   To the sponge, add the sugar, the water and the butter and stir the
  mixture until it is combined well. Add the flour, the aniseed, and the salt
  and with the electric mixer fitted with the dough hook knead the dough for
  3 minutes, or until it is smooth but still sticky. Transfer the dough to a
  lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat it with the oil, and let it rise,
  covered tightly with plastic wrap, for 1 1/2 hours, or until it is double
  in bulk.
    Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, halve it, and with
  floured hands form each piece of dough into a flattish log 15 inches long
  and 2 inches wide. Transfer the logs to a buttered and floured baking sheet
  and let them rise, covered with a kitchen towel, for 2 hours, or until they
  are double in bulk.
    Bake the logs in the middle of a preheated 350F oven for 30 minutes, or
  until they are golden brown, and let them cool on the baking sheet on a
  rack for 10 minutes. On a cutting board cut the logs crosswise on the
  diagonal into 1 inch thick slices, arrange the biscotti, cut sides down, on
  the baking sheet and bake them in the 350F oven for 10 minutes on each
  side, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the biscotti to racks to cool
  and store them in airtight containers. MAKES:ABOUT 30 BISCOTTI

      Title: Krumiri
 Categories: Cookies, Italian
      Yield: 48 servings
 
      1 c  Unsalted butter                     1 ts Vanilla extract
    2/3 c  Sugar                           1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      3    Egg yolks                           1 c  Yellow cornmeal
 
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 325F. Beat the butter with the sugar by hand, with a
  hand mixer set at medium speed, or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the
  paddle. Continue beating until the mixture lightens both in texture and
  color, about 4 or 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla, then the yolks, one at a
  time, beating smooth after each addition. Stir the flour and cornmeal
  together, and stir into the butter mixture by hand. Line 2 or 3 cookie
  sheets with parchment paper and pipe the Krumiri in horseshoe or stick
  shapes, using a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tube (Ateco #4).
  Bake about 15 minutes. Remove from pans and cool on a rack.
  
  VARIATION OF KRUMIRI: SCHIACCATINE DI GRANTURCO. These wonderful biscotti
  are always on the bar at Tonino and Claudia Verro's charming inn, Contea,
  at Neive, near Alba in Piemonte. The surrounding area, known as the Langhe
  for its situation in the Langa hills, has some of Italy's most breathtaking
  natural scenery, as well as excellent wine and Grappa.
  
  FOLLOW THE RECIPE FOR KRUMIRI, but do not pipe the dough. Divide the dough
  in half and place each half on a piece of parchment or wax paper. Shape the
  dough into a rough log about 1-inch diameter and about 6 inches long. Roll
  and tighten the paper around the dough, to make it perfectly cylindrical.
  Chill the cylinders of dough about 1 hour, until firm. Remove one piece at
  a time from the refrigerator and slice the cylinder into disks 1/4-inch
  thick. Arrange the disks of dough on paper-lined cookie sheets, 1 inch
  apart on all sides. Continue with the other cylinder of dough. Bake as for
  the Krumiri.

  THOSE THAT CONTAIN SALT if so, don't add too much and don't add extra salt.

  Variety is said to be the spice of life and, whereas for many millions of
  people throughout the world, life has been a variety of spices for
  centuries, it's only thanks to early explorers, who returned home with
  shiploads of exotic spices, that Western culinary art was transformed.
  
  THE BOOK OF HOT & SPICY FOODS has a collection of over 100 beautifully
  illustrated step-by-step recipes which include traditional favorites like
  Steak au Poivre, Mexican Chili con Carne, Indonesian Gado Gado and Creole
  Jambalaya, plus many Indian and Oriental dishes and lots of sizzling new
  surprises and variations on a theme. Whether it's a simple snack, a teatime
  treat or an elegant dinner party dish you're after, this book has a recipe
  for all occasions.
  
  Spices are invaluable for adding that special blend of heat or fragrance
  and pungency to all manner of savory and sweet dishes. Don't be daunted by
  those unfamiliar to you - try them, you'll never know what you've been
  missing, but bear in mind that some are stronger and fierier than others.
  If experimenting, it is wise to start with small amounts - you can always
  add more to taste at a later stage. And remember - the amount of spices in
  many of the following recipes are suggested as a guide, so feel free to
  increase or decrease the amounts according to personal preference.
  
  It is the chili (in its various forms) that adds heat to a dish. You will
  find instructions on how to prepare this fiery spice (without getting
  burnt!), plus many recipes using it. There is also plenty of information on
  all the other hot spices - muctard, pepper, cloves and ginger - plus, of
  course, the more fragrant, aeromatic ones like cardamom, cumin, nutmeg,
  etc. And no spice book would be complete without recipes for making Curry
  Powder, Garam Masala, Five Spice Powder, Mixed Spice, Pickling Spice and
  Harissa (a Middle Eastern favorite).
  
  The follwing recipes range from mild to hot or just wonderfully spicy. It
  is surely a collection to please not only hot and spicy food-lovers
  everywhere, but also tempting enough to persuade the "uninitiated" to
  sample the delights of spicy foods!

      Title: Chilies
 Categories: Information, Mexican, Chili
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           No Ingredients                 
 
  Chilies belong to the capsicum family, as do sweet peppers, but there the
  relationship ends, for the fiery heat of the chili is in no way similar to
  its mild-flavored relation. Fresh chilies are now widely available and vary
  considerably in size, shape and heat factor. In principle, the fatter
  chilies tend to be more mild than the long, thin varieties, and the smaller
  the chili, the hotter its taste. Generally, the unripened, green chili is
  less fiery than when ripened and red. This is a useful guide to follow, but
  there are exceptions according to the variety, so it is wise to remember
  that all chilies, irrespective of color, shape and size, are hot, so use
  caution before adding them to a dish. Bear in mind that a little chili goes
  a long way, so add a small amount to begin with and gradually increase the
  quantity to your liking during cooking.
  
  Take care when preparing chilies - the tiny, cream-colored seeds inside are
  the hottest part and, in general, are removed before using. Chilies contain
  a pungent oil which can cause an unpleasant burning sensation to eyes and
  skin, so it's a wise precaution to wear rubber gloves when handling chilies
  and be sure not to touch your face and eyes during preparation. Cut off the
  stalk end, then split open the pod and scrape out seeds, using a pointed
  knife, and discard. Rinse pod thoroughly with cold running water and pat
  chili dry before chopping or slicing as required. Once this task is
  completed, always wash your hands, utensils and surfaces thoroughly with
  soapy water.
  
  Dried red chilies are sold whole and can vary in size from 1/2-3/4 to
  1-1/2-2 inches in length, so this into account when using. If a recipe
  states small dried chilies, and you only have the larger ones, adapt and
  lessen the quantity accordingly, or to taste. Dried chilies are usually
  soaked in hot water for 1 hour before draining and removing seeds as
  described above), unless a recipe states otherwise.
  
  Dried red chilies, when ground, are used to make cayenne pepper and
  combined with other spices and seasonings, also make chili and curry
  powder, and chili seasoning. They are also used in the making of hot-pepper
  sauce and chili sauces.
  
  The Harissa spice mix uses a large quantity of dried chilies and is very
  hot, so be forewarned! This is a favorite spice mix for many Middle Eastern
  dishes. Don't be tempted to add more Harissa than recipe states, unless you
  are prepared for an extremely hot dish. A less fiery Harissa can be made
  simply by removing the seeds from soaked chilies before crushing chilies
  with other ingredients.
  
  Green chilies are available canned. These are often seeded and peeled and
  taste pleasantly hot and spicy - ideal for adding to pizza toppings, sauces
  and taco fillings. Both red and green chilies also come pickled in jars
  (hot or mild/sweet) and can be found in delicatessens and ethnic food
  shops. Canned and pickled varieties should be drained and patted dry before
  using. Whether you seed the pickled type is up to you, just remember the
  seeds are the hottest part!

      Title: Mustard
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           No Ingredients                 
 
  White or yellow, brown and black seeds come from the mustard plant,
  according to the species. Most commonly found is the creamy yellow type
  which is the least pungent. The brown type (or Indian mustard) is stronger
  in flavor, while the black mustard seed is the most powerful of all. The
  creamy yellow seeds are more widely available, but look for the black and
  brown types in Asian and Oriental food shops and delicatessens.
  
  Whole mustard seeds have a pleasant nutty bite to them and can be used to
  add piquancy to salad dressing and hot sauces. They are especially good
  when served with fish, chicken and pork and are also delicious added to
  cole slaw, creamy potato salad, pickles and chutneys. Use mustard seeds
  (especially the two hotter varieties) with discretion to begin with,
  increasing the amount as you become more familiar with the flavors.
  
  It is the yellow seed which, when processed with black seeds, wheat flour
  and turmeric, forms the basis of English mustard. Dry mustard can be used
  as it is in cooking, or it may be mixed to a paste with a little cord or
  warm water. (For a nice, rich mixture, why not try mixing it with a little
  cream or milk?) Once mixed it should be left at least 10 minutes to allow
  time for the flavors to develop. It is only when the powder is mixed with a
  liquid that the essential oils are released, giving mustard its pungency
  and sensation of heat. Remember that made mustard loses its pungency after
  a few hours. Jars of prepared mustard, once opened, need using within a few
  weeks as the flavor and color will deteriorate.
  
  The variety of ready-prepared mustards come in a bewildering number of
  mouthwatering flavors, according to the manufacturer. These can be made
  from milled mustard flour, or from coarsely crushed seed (the proportions
  of which vary tremendously, depending on the type). Some are mixed with
  vinegar, others with grape juice or wine (and sometimes beer), and often
  contain various spices, herbs and seasonings, such as honey and
  horseradish. German mustard, which is mild and sweet-flavored, is a mixture
  of brown and white mustard flour moistened with vinegar and flavored with
  various spices. The mild-flavored American mustard (popular with children)
  generally uses only yellow mustard seeds with the addition of sugar,
  vinegar and salt. Dijon-style mustard, nade from milled, husked black
  seeds, is flavored with wine and spices. The pungent and spicy grainy types
  of mustard are a mixture of whole, crushed black and yellow seeds with
  additional flavorings added for individuality.
  
  Mustards of all types can be used to great effect, not only as a condiment,
  but also as a culinary ingredient. They add bite and piquancy to all types
  of savory dishes from scrambled eggs, sauces and dressings to deviled
  mixtures, barbecued food, soups, casseroles, pastry, scones and cheesy
  biscuits.

  ALLSPICE: These small dark, reddish-brown berries are so called because
  their aroma and flavor resemble a combination of cinnamon, cloves and
  nutmeg. Use berries whole in marinades; for boiling and pot roasting meats
  and poultry; in fish dishes, pickles and chutneys. Also available ground
  and excellent for flavoring soups, sauces and desserts.
  
  ANISE: Commonly called asniseed, these small, brown oval seeds have the
  sweet, pungent flavor of licorice. Also available ground. Use seeds in
  stews and vegetable dishes, or sprinkle over loaves and rolls before
  baking. Try ground anise for flavoring fish dishes and pastries for fruit
  pies.
  
  CARAWAY: Small brown, crescent-shaped seeds with a strong liquorice flavor
  and especially delicious as a flavoring in braised cabbage and sauerkraut
  recipes, breads (particularly rye), cakes and cheeses.
  
  CARDAMOM: Small, triangular-shaped pods containing numerous small black
  seeds which have a warm, highly aeromatic flavor. You can buy green or
  black cardamoms although the smaller green type is more widely available.
  
  CAYENNE: Orangey-red in color, this ground pepper is extremely hot and
  pungent. Not to be confused with paprika which, although related, is mild
  flavored.
  
  CHILI POWDER: Made from dried red chilies. This red powder varies in flavor
  and hotness, from mild to hot. A less fiery type is found in chili
  seasoning.
  
  CINNAMON & CASSIA: Shavings of bark from the cinnamon tree are processed
  and curled to form cinnamon sticks. Also available in ground form. Spicy,
  fragrant and sweet, it is used widely in savory and sweet dishes. Cassia
  (from the dried bark of the cassia tree) is similar to cinnamon, but less
  delicate in flavor with a slight pungent 'bite'.
  
  CLOVES: These dried, unopened flower buds give a warm aroma and pungency to
  foods, but should be used with care as the flavor can become overpowering.
  Available in ground form. Cloves are added to soups, sauces, mulled drinks,
  stewed fruits and apple pies.
  
  CORIANDER: Available in seed and ground form. These tiny, pale brown seeds
  have a mild, spicy flavor with a slight orange peel fragrance. An essential
  spice in curry dishes, but also extremely good in many cake and cookie
  recipes.
  
  CUMIN: Sold in seed or ground. Cumin has a warm, pungent aromatic flavor
  and is used extensively in flavor curries and many Middle Eastern and
  Mexican dishes. Popular in Germany for flavoring sauerkraut and pork
  dishes. Use ground or whole in meat dishes and stuffed vegetables.
  
  All spices should be stored in small airtight jars in a cool, dark place,
  as heat, moisture and sunlight reduce their flavor.

      Title: A To Z of Spices (Part 2)
 Categories: Information, Spices/etc.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           No Ingredients                 
 
  FENUGREEK: These small, yellow-brown seeds have a slight bitter flavor
  which, when added in small quantities, is very good in curries, chutneys
  and pickles, soups, fish and shellfish dishes.
  
  GINGER: Available in many forms. Invaluable for adding to many savory and
  sweet dishes and for baking gingerbread and brandy snaps. Fresh ginger root
  looks like a knobby stem. It should be peeled and finely chopped or sliced
  before use. Dreid ginger root is very hard and light beige in color. To
  release flavor, "bruise" with a spoon or soak in hot water before using.
  This dried type is more often used in pickling, jam making and preserving.
  Also available in ground form, preserved stem ginger and crystallized
  ginger.
  
  MACE & NUTMEG: Both are found on the same plant. The nutmeg is the inner
  kernel of the fruit. When ripe, the fruit splits open to reveal bright red
  arils which lie around the shell of the nutmeg - and once dried are known
  as mace blades. The flavor of both spices is very similar - warm, sweet and
  aromatic, although nutmeg is more delicate than mace. Both spices are also
  sold ground. Use with vegetables; sprinkled over egg dishes, milk puddings
  and custards; eggnogs and mulled drinks; or use as a flavoring in desserts.
  
  PAPRIKA: Comes from a variety of pepper (capsicum) and although similar in
  color to cayenne, this bright red powder has a mild flavor.
  
  PEPPER: White pepper comes from ripened berries with the outer husks
  removed. Black pepper comes from unripened berries dried until dark
  greenish-black in color. Black pepper is more subtle than white. Use white
  or black peppercorns in marinades and pickling, or freshly ground as a
  seasoning. Both are available ground. Green peppercorns are also unripe
  berries with a mild, light flavor. They are canned in brine or pickled, or
  freeze-dried in jars. They add a pleasant, light peppery flavor to sauces,
  pates and salad dressings. Drain those packed in liquid and use either
  whole or mash them lightly before using. Dry green peppercorns should be
  lightly crushed before using to help release flavor, unless otherwise
  stated in a recipe.
  
  POPPY SEEDS: These tiny, slate-blue seeds add a nutty flavor to both sweet
  and savory dishes. Sprinkle over desserts and breads.
  
  SAFFRON: This pice comes from the stigmas of a species of crocus. It has a
  distinctive flavor and gives a rich yellow coloring to dishes, however, it
  is also the most expensive spice to buy. Available in small packets or jars
  (either powdered or in strands - the strands being far superior in flavor).
  This spice is a must for an authentic paella or Cornish Saffron Cake. Also
  an extremely good flavoring for soups, fish and chicken dishes.
  
  SESAME SEEDS: High in protein and mineral oil content, sesame seeds have a
  crisp texture and sweet, nutty flavor which combines well in curries and
  with chicken, pork and fish dishes. Use also to sprinkle over breads,
  cookies and pastries before baking.
  
  STAR ANISE: This dried, star-shaped seed head has a pungent, aromatic
  smell, rather similar to fennel. Use very sparingly in stir-fry dishes.
  Also good with fish and poultry.
  
  TURMERIC: Closely related to ginger, it is an aromatic root which is dried
  and ground to produce a bright, orange-yellow powder. It has a rich, warm,
  distinctive smell, a delicate, aromatic flavor and helps give dishes an
  attractive yellow coloring. Use in curries, fish and shellfish dishes, rice
  pilafs and lentil mixtures. It is also a necessary ingredient in mustard
  pickles and piccalilli.
  
  All spices should be stored in small airtight jars in a cool, dark place,
  as heat, moisture and sunlight reduce their flavor.

 Categories: Ethnic, Breads
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    Egg yolk                          1/2    All-purpose flour
 
  These are *not* fluffy dumplings as in chicken and dumplings.  They are a
  "sturdy" potato dumpling served as a side dish to meat, and usually with a
  sweet sauerkraut/carraway/honey dish as the vegetable.
  
                  *                       *                       *
  
  Boil peeled potatoes in small quantity of water.  Drain potatoes
  thoroughly.  Rice potatoes through hand held masher/ricer.  Let potatoes
  cool.  On floured board, gradually add flour working mixture into dough
  with hands.  Shape potato mixture into a long roll and cut into 10 slices.
  Drop dumplings into boiling water and boil gently about 5 minutes.
  
  Drain dumplings on paper towel.  The dumplings are fully cooked after the
  boiling process, but traditionally, Czechoslovakians then melt butter in a
  heavy frying pan, and fry the dumplings until they are lightly browned on
  all sides.

    1/4 c  Minced parsley (optional)         1/4 c  Dry white wine - or gravy
    1/4 ts Ground thyme                             Salt and pepper to taste

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter                              1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Flour                               2 c  Grated Cheddar Cheese
      3 c  Chicken broth - I use             1/4 ts Tobasco
           - homemade gravy instead                 Salt and pepper to taste
 
  In bowl, combine filling ingredients; salt and pepper to taste
  
  In Saucepan, melt butter, add flour.  Stir in broth and milk; cook until

  Fill Stuff-a-roni.
  
  Cover bottom of 2 quart baking dish with 1 cup cheese sauce.  Arrange

  sauce.
  
  Cover dish with foil and bake at 375-degrees F., for one hour; or cover
  dish with waxed paper and microwave 30 minutes turning once.
  
  Note: I usually make this dish after Thanksgiving.  I freeze left over
  turkey and gravy, and then later, when turkey seems like a treat again, I
  make the Stuff-a-roni.  I do not use the wine; in it's place I use turkey
  gravy, and when it calls for broth, I also use a fair portion of turkey
  gravy.

  Select squid with hoods about 10-12 cm (4-5 inches) long.
  
  To clean squid, pull off head and attached tentacles.  Cut out eyes and
  beak and discard.  Clean dark skin from head and tentacles by pulling it
  off or rubbing off with a cloth dipped in coarse salt.  Rinse, chop 3 to 4
  into small pieces and keep aside.  Remainder may be stored and fried later.
  
  Clean out hood (body) and remove transparent backbone from inside.  Pull or
  rub off skin.  Rinse well, drain and dry.
  
  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan and gently fry onion until transparent. Stir
  in rice and stir over heat for 2 minutes.  Add tomato puree, water,
  cinnamon stick, cloves, chopped squid, and salt and pepper to taste.  Cover
  and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Remove
  cinnamon stick and cloves.
  
  Fill hoods with rice mixture, packing it in loosely as rice expands and
  hoods contract during cooking.  Close top with wooden cocktail picks or sew
  with strong thread.
  
  Heat remaining oil in a deep pan and fry squid hoods until lightly
  coloured, turning them frequently.  Reduce heat, add wine, cover and simmer
  gently on low heat for 1 hour or until squid is tender.  Add a little water
  to pan if necessary during cooking.  Serve hot or warm as a mezethaki
  (appetizer).

  Servings:  1
  
  These are *not* fluffy dumplings as in chicken and dumplings.  They are a
  "sturdy" potato dumpling served as a side dish to meat, and usually with a
  sweet sauerkraut/carraway/honey dish as the vegetable.
  
  *                       *                       *
  
  Boil peeled potatoes in small quantity of water.  Drain potatoes
  thoroughly.  Rice potatoes through hand held masher/ricer.  Let potatoes
  cool.  On floured board, gradually add flour working mixture into dough
  with hands.  Shape potato mixture into a long roll and cut into 10 slices.
  Drop dumplings into boiling water and boil gently about 5 minutes.
  
  Drain dumplings on paper towel.  The dumplings are fully cooked after the
  boiling process, but traditionally, Czechoslovakians then melt butter in a
  heavy frying pan, and fry the dumplings until they are lightly browned on
  all sides.

      Title: Pierogi
 Categories: Pasta, Polish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2    Eggs                                2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Water                             1/2 ts Salt
 
  Mound flour on kneading board and make hole in center. Drop eggs into hole
  and cut into flour with a knife. Add salt and water and knead until firm.
  Let rest for 10 minutes covered with a warm bowl. Divide dough in halves
  and roll thin. Cut circles with a large biscuit cutter. Place a small mound
  of filling a little to one side on each round of dough. Moisten edge with a
  little water, fold over and press edges firmly together. Be sure they are
  well sealed to prevent the filling from running out. Drop the pierogi into
  salted boiling water. Cook gently for for 3 to 5 minutes. Lift out of water
  carefully with a perforated spoon.
  
  The dough has a tendency to dry while you are working. A dry dough will not
  seal completely. We suggest rolling out a large circle of dough, placing
  small mounds of filling far enough apart to allow for cutting, and folding
  the dough over the mounds of filling. Then cut with a small biscuit cutter
  and seal firmly.
  
  Never crowd or pile pierogi. The uncooked will stick and the cooked will
  lose shape and lightness.
  
  Note: Pierogi can be frozen after boiling and they keep well. I perfer all
  my pierogi fried in butter and onions and seasoned with salt and pepper.
  They should be fried on a medium low heat till golden brown.

  In large pot, bring water and remaining salt to a boil. Press spaetzle
  dough, a small amount at a time, through colander with large holes (not
  slits), or drop by 1/4 tspful, into the boiling water. After water returns

  I haven't made these lemon ones yet, but I scaled down a larger recipe from
  some cookbook to resemble the pecan tassie proportions, hoping to have
  enough lemon filling for a batch of tartlets. So it may or may not be
  enough, thought I'd let ya know.
  
  LEMON TASSIE FILLING
  
  In a small saucepan over low heat, cook the 1 st three until dissolved.
  Beat the eggs with a mixer and add the hot mix very slowly, mixing
  constantly. Then return mix to the saucepan and cook for about 3 minutes
  until it's of pudding consistency. Stir in lemon peel. Let cool to room
  temp. Fill each tartlet with about 2 tsps of the lemon mix. Bake at 350 F
  for 20-25 mins., or until golden.
  
  The back of the tart tamper package also suggested some other fillings,
  like cherry or blueberry pie filling, or vanilla pudding topped afterwards
  with a strawberry or a few blueberries (glaze with some heated currant
  jelly).

           -Chopped                       
 
    DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together sugar, butter and
    shortening.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
    addition. Add flour and Fresca alternately.  Add baking powder and
    when mixture is fully creamed, add vanilla and fruit rinds.  Pour into
    greased and floured 9 X 13-inch Cake Pan.  Bake 1 hour or until cake
    tester comes out clean.
    FROSTING:
    Mix all ingredients except cherries and beat constantly while heating
    in the top of a double boiler.  When thoroughly mixed, thick, and
    spreadable, frost cake.  Decorate top of cake with chopped maraschino
    cherries.
    NOTE:
    Since Fresca is available only in limited areas if at all, 7-up may be
    a good substitution, or any lemon-lime drink.  Also, since the problem
    with the cherries has been resolved with a different food coloring,
    you may use the new ones or use gum drops instead for the garnish.
    Syrup from a can of dark cherries might be substituted for the
    Maraschino cherry syrup.

    DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
    *** The recipe specified "butter and lard mixed" for "shortening".
    Wash the meat, cover with water, add seasonings to taste and cook
    slowly for several hours. Wash and peel the potatoes and cut into thin
    slices. Cook until tender. Drain off all of the water, add the 3 Tbsp
    of butter, salt and pepper to taste, parsley and onion. Mix well. Beat
    the eggs, add to potatoes and beat mixture lightly. Let stand until
    pastry is made. Sift together the flour, baking powder and 1/2 tsp
    salt. Work in the 4 Tbsp of shortening and then add the water, using
    only enough to hold dough together. Roll thin on a floured board and
    cut into large circles, about 10 inches in diameter, spread with some
    of the potato mixture, fold dough to form a semi-circle, pressing

    large skillet until the meat is brown.  Drain off the excess fat.
    Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining ingredients except the
    pie crust mix and set aside.  Prepare the pastry as for a 2 crust pie
    as directed on the package.  Divide the pastry into 8 equal parts.
    Roll each part, on a lightly floured surface, into a 7-inch circle.
    On half of the circle, spread about 1/4 cup of the meat mixture
    (packed) to within 1/2-inch of the edge.  Moisten the edge of the
    pastry with water and fold over the meat mixture, sealing the edges
    with a fork.  Place on an ungreased baking sheet and prick the tops
    with the fork.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes.  You can serve these as
    sandwiches or, if you prefer, place on a plate and top with gravy or
    sauce.
    NOTE:  You can substitute 1 cup of your favorite cooked vegetable for
    the peas or carrots in this recipe.

    DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
    ** Use beef chuck, rump, or round.
    *** My notes:  Watch meat while it sits and add more vinegar and water
    (half of each) to keep meat covered.  A similar recipe in Bon Appetit
    used red vinegar and red wine for the marinade and the beef was left
    in the refrigerator for about 9 days.
    Wipe meat with damp cloth and then sprinkle thoroughly with salt and
    pepper. Place meat in an earthen dish and add vinegar and enough water
    to cover. Add the bay leaves, peppercorns and cloves, and let stand
    tightly covered for 5 days in a cool place.
    Cut carrots in strips; slice onions. Put meat in a dutch oven and
    brown well on all sides. Add the carrots and onions and 1 cup of the
    spiced vinegar. Cover tightly and cook over low flame about 3 hours or
    until meat is tender. When meat is cooked, add the sugar and crumbled
    ginger snaps and cook for 10 minutes. This makes delicious gravy. If
    necessary, more of the spiced vinegar may be added.

       Get out a beautiful glass serving tray or any other large serving tray
  and arrang carefully the following:
  
  Make carrot curls.  Use a potato peeler to give you long, thin stirps. Roll
  up strips and crowd, side by side, in a deep bowl. Cover with water and
  chill.
  
  For celery branches, cut vcelery stalk in 3-inch lengths and make small
  slices on each end--not quite trhough to the middle. Place in bowl, cover
  with water and chill.
  
  For radishes, make many "almost through" slices on the tip. They will open
  after they've been placed in a bowl, covered with water and chilled.
  (Carrots will curl, radishes will open, and celery will turn into miniature
  branches if, after they are cut, they are submerged into a bowl of cold
  water and refrigerated a few hours or overnight.)

      Title: Italian Tray 2
 Categories: Salads, Italian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           (No Ingredients)               
 
  (CONTINUED FROM PART ONE)
  
  Salami, Polish ham, or other cold cuts can be cut into halves or triangles.
  If you want to go fancy, soften cream cheese, fill and roll up a slice of
  meat. Secure with a toothpick and green olive.
  
  Cherry tomatoes can be left whole and beautiful or you can cut off the very
  top of them and scoop out the insides. Then fill with tuna or deviled ham
  salad mix. For the added zing, use a little bit of horseradish in the tuna
  or ham.  Dust the tops with parsley.
  
  Olives, black and green, and green onions complete the tray. (You might
  want to top the whole tray off with little pieces of ice here and there to
  keep it all fresh and delicious.) YIELD: Depends on cold cuts and
  vegetables in the Italian Tray.

      Title: Nanny's Irish Bread
 Categories: Breads, Desserts, Irish
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      4 c  All Purpose Flour                  16 oz Sour Cream
      3 ts Baking Powder                       3 ea Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Baking Soda                         1 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Sugar                               1 x  Raisins-as much as you like
 
  Mix together all dry ingredients:  the flour, sugar, baking powder, and
  baking soda.  In a separate bowl,  mix together all wet ingredients: the
  sour cream,  eggs, and vanilla. Now mix the dry ingredients into the wet
  ingredients.  Mix thoroughly.  Should be a  slightly sticky dough texture.
  Add the raisins to  taste.  My family likes a lot of raisins, so I put in
  enough so that there's a raisin in almost every bite! Bake at 325 degrees
  for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or  until skewer comes out clean.
  :::This recipe came from my grandmother, Julia O'Malley, who was very
  affectionately called "Nanny" by her 40 or so grandchildren. She was born
  and raised in County Meath, Ireland, where this bread was a staple. She
  lived to be 98 years young, and fed me this Irish Bread 'till the end! It
  is a pleasure to honor her memory by sharing it with you.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 18 servings
 
           -Molly's Recipes              

----------------------------------PRETZELS----------------------------------
  2 1/2 ts Yeast                           1 1/3 tb Sugar
      4 c  Flour                           2 1/2 tb Margarine; or butter
    2/3 ts Salt                            1 1/3 c  -Water

------------------------------WATER FOR 'BATH------------------------------
      4 c  -water; at a simmer                 5 ts Baking soda
 
  Add into the bread machine in this order.  Set on manual.
  
  FORMING: Cut dough into short strips, roll into ropes and shape into
  pretzels. Cover with a tea towel and let rise for 45 minutes. 'BATH': In a
  cast iron or OTHER NON-ALUMINUM pan, bring almost to a boil 4 cups of water
  and 5 teaspoons of baking soda. Gently place (by hand or using slotted
  spoon) the pretzels into the water for approximately 15 seconds on each
  side turning once.  Do NOT let water come to a boil. Remove pretzels and
  place on a greased baking sheet. Sprinkle with coarse salt (kosher). Bake
  at 475 for 12 minutes.
  
  NOTE: In my oven it took only about 10 minutes, so watch carefully. Do NOT
  make the strips too fat; they really puff up. If you are on a salt-free
  diet, use sesame, poppy, garlic; whatever you like on the outside...the
  WHOLE family, both upstairs and downstairs loved them and the DAK did all
  the hard work.
   * If you use a machine that needs the water first add ingredients in
  reverse order. FROM: Donna German's THE BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK I and

      1 c  Crisco 3/4 to 1 1/2 c OK            1 pn Salt
    3/4 ts CLEAR Vanilla                     1/2 c  *<or more>Milk or Water
    1/4 ts CLEAR Almond                        2 lb Confectioners' Sugar
    1/4 ts CLEAR Butter                      1/3 c  *Cream Whip Icing Base
 
  *By Henry & Henry. Only available in Wholesale Bakery Supply in 5 gal pail.
  You might try substituting regular marshmallow creme. Does not contain
  gum------only difference. But one reason I use this is to make my
  buttercream roses crust harder. I can handle them better. We sell this in
  smaller quantities in our cake supply shop. Other reasons to use it: Makes
  icing softer & more "whipped creamy" tasting. ~Takes out a little of the
  sweet taste too. Add in order given: Crisco and flavors in a heavy duty
  mixer on low speed. Add milk or water and confectioners' sugar. Mix on
  medium speed until light and fluffy. Keep icing covered at all times. This
  recipe will cover one cake mix and do decorations. Keeps unrefrigerated for
  2 weeks in reasonably cool room. Keeps indefinately in fridge...Yes, made
  using milk too! Milk/Water- makes no difference in taste. But <purple>
  roses made using milk, don't fade to blue. ***Hand-held mixer: Don't add
  all the p.sugar so you won't burn up the mixer. When icing is nice &
  fluffy, THEN add the rest of the p.sugar...or enough to get it to
  spreadable consistency. If mixer gets hot <set a timer!>, turn it off for
  20 minutes to cool it down or its ruined! Chocolate Icing: Add Hershey's
  Cocoa <no sub> until the buttercream icing becomes the nice rich chocolate
  color you want. If you want strong chocolate taste, you must add more
  cocoa. Butter: Of course icing made with butter tastes better. But it melts
  just setting out, so think what it does in the bag in your warm hands! Of
  course, you can substitute butter for Crisco <same amounts> or sub. half
  the Crisco, making it half Crisco & half butter. When butter icing is
  requested, I do it & just caution my customers that the decorations won't
  be as perfect. Usually they don't mind. Dolores McCann, Hamilton, OH...ICES

------------------------------ADD & BEAT MORE------------------------------
    1/2 c  Warmed glucose*               

-----------------------------ADD AT END & BEAT-----------------------------
      1 ts Or more flavorings**           
 
  *Set a measuring cup in hot water & add glucose. Stir until warm and thin.
  Add as directed above. **Add almond extract and <clear> vanilla to taste.
  Add this only at the end, to prevent icing from breaking down. Don't add
  butter flavor, may contain fat! Using "fine" sugar & salt is not necassary
  as long as you aren't going to press the icing through very fine decorating
  tips <#1,0,00, or 000>. I use regular. This icing is like the insides of
  marshmallows without the coating. It is the same as 7-minute icing without
  the cooking time. ***Be sure all utensils used are grease-free. Any bit of
  grease will break the icing down to soup.
   Very good-tasting. Great to use this type when adding coconut because it
  never crusts. Great to decorate with. Makes wonderful flowers, but
  remember, they don't crust. I have made flowers with it & they would crust
  ~ after a few weeks, but every time it rained, they got sticky again. This
  icing is the type used by professionals who do lots of big figure-piped
  characters, since it is sooo smooth & especially since it is sooo
  light-weight. Dolores McCann, Oxford OH

    2/3 c  Light Karo                          1 ts Or more citric acid**
    3/4 c  Water                          
 
  Have color/flavor/citric acid ready when finished cooking! *More or less,
  some flavors are stronger than others. **Put citric acid in fruit-flavored
  candies for tartness. TEST YOUR THERMOMETER EVERY DAY! To test: Place it in
  cold water & bring to boil. If water boils at- say 210 instead of 212,
  reduce cooking time 2 degrees. ***I use a TAYLOR thermometer. Wilton sells
  them now. Spray *PAM in molds & on surface. Not too much & only once per
  session. USE A THIN PAN, NOT HEAVY! Candy must set a few minutes in the pan
  & the temp will rise, burning the candy in a thick pan. Bring mixture to
  boil. Put lid on for 3 minutes <to wash down sugar crystals>, add
  thermometer & DON'T STIR. When therm. reaches 285-290D. remove pot from
  stove.Wait for temp. to lower below 260^ before adding color/flavor/citric
  acid. <Will cook flavor out if too hot.> Cover pan after adding citric acid
  so it won't fade the taste. I add about 2 ts citric acid.
        DON'T STIR!  Use the tiny viles of Lorann oils. Avail. in cake supply
  shop or drug store.
   I pour the cooked candy into a GUTTMAN candy funnel <holds entire recipe.>
  Thats the quickest way to get it in molds befor it cools & hardens. *Of
  course, spray funnel! I pour some into molds & the rest onto my marble
  slab. The part on the slab: I roll it into a long cylinder & cut into
  "pillows" w/scissors. Dust finished candies with powdered sugar so they
  won't "melt" together. There is one very nice sucker mold. It is a white
  ring w/ a slit for the stick. <Don't spray stick.> All you do is spray
  mold, add stick, fill w/candy, cool & remove easily Comes in 2-3 sizes,
  round or heart-shaped. I beleive it is Guttman Brand & available here at
  Sugarcraft. About 2 dz in a pack. This is my kids favorite Christmas candy.
  You will want to make several flavors. Experiment on how-much flavor. All
  vary. *Don't add too much on the mints. Takes more on the
  cherry/strawberry/lemon/orange, etc. There are at least 50 oil flavors
  available to choose from! Shared by Dolores McCann, Hamilton OH

  bowl, add whatever color/flavor, etc you like. Below are some ideas:
  Vanilla cremes: add vanilla ****to taste. Chocolate cremes: add melted dark
  chocolate to taste. Mint center: add drops of peppermint oil & pink
  coloring. Black Walnut center: add drops black walnut oil & bl walnuts.
  Peanutbutter cremes: add smooth or crunchy peanut butter. Pineapple cremes:
  add drops pineapple oil, chopped candied pineapple & chopped pecans. Jelly:
  add fruit "flavored" jelly into candy mold with matching flavored oil
  w/creme center. Nut center: wrap creme center mix around a nut meat as
  filling; dip in white/tinted, or milk chocolate. Chocolate covered cherries
  <cream type:> wrap creme center  mix around a well-drained marachino
  cherry...be sure the cherry is SEALED in the dough, chill & dip in choc.*
  Be sure to dip as soon as removing from fridge. The acid in the cherry
  causes it to start cordialing <liquifying> quickly. Will liquify some, but
  some will remain "creamy" because of the butter. Coconut cremes: add
  maccaroon coconut & drops or coconut oil For any dipped cremes: Form 1"
  balls, let crust over & dip in compound coating chocolate. This is also
  called "dipping chocolate." I prefer the brand "Merckens." It seems to take
  more abuse/ reheating, or getting too hot, etc. Dolores McCann, Hamilton

   This has been a never-fail recipe for me. The only problem I have had is
  cooking too long; then you had better have someone to help you drop the
  candy before it gets too hard.

      Title: Hints for Using a Candy Thermometer
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
--------------------------CANDY CLASS, SUGARCRAFT--------------------------
 
  ...Learn all the secrets of really GREAT candy making! *The first thing
  that should be done each day, before you start, is to TEST YOUR
  THERMOMETER! To do: immerse therm. in cold water. Bring to a boil.
     At sea level water boils at 212 degrees <on a sunny day.> If your water
  boils at 210 degrees, you should reduce the cooking time by 2 degrees. Most
  of the time, water boils here about 208 d. Try not to cook candies on a
  rainy day. The barometric pressure, when the air is heavy, holds the
  mercury in your thermometer down. "Make candy when the sun shines," motto
  of a good candy maker. *I recommend a TAYLOR or WILTON thermometer. Use a
  thin (good quality) pan for candies that MUST STAY IN THE PAN for any
  length of time for cooling. If you leave the thermometer in the pan, you
  may notice the temp. rising even after the candy is removed fro the stove.
  Using a heavy pan, your candy will burn, in this case. Use a HEAVY PAN for
  fudges, fondants, etc., that are to be dumped immediately. Dolores McCann,
  OH-- teacher.

      Title: Cooked Fondant
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 20 servings
 
      5 c  Sugar                               4 tb Margarine or butter
      1 c  Coffee Rich or Half & Half        1/2 ts Cream of Tartar
      1 c  Cream (no sub!)                
 
  Combine butter, sugar, Coffee Rich, cream & Cream Of Tartar in a heavy
  saucepan. Stir until sugar is well moistened. Place on high heat. Bring to
  boil then cover mixture for 2-3 minutes (to prevent sugar crystals from
  forming). Uncover & place thermometer in boiling mixture. COOK WITHOUT
  STIRRING. Wipe any crystals from sides of pan. Cook to exactly 236 degrees.
  Immedietely pour out onto a marble slab. When heat is no longer coming from
  the mass of candy...test it with your finger tips or wrist...when the dents
  made with your fingers remain for a little time instead of filling in
  immedietely & candy is luke warm, candy is ready to work. Work fondant with
  candy paddle until it sets up. Allow it to rest 15 minutes, covered. Then
  knead it until perfectly smooth. Like magic, the "crumbs will turn to
  wonderful creamy candy!
    Form into a ball, place on Saran wrap & into a bowl that can be tightly
  sealed.
   This fondant is best if kept a day or so before using, but may be used I
  Hints:   For stiffer fondant, cook 1-2 degrees more. Freezing makes it
  sticky.

      1    12-14 defrosted turkey              1    Recipe Turkey Basting Agent
      1    Large Oven Roasting Bag                  (see index)
 
  TURKEY COOKED IN THE MICROWAVE REMAINS TASTY LONGER THEN OVEN
  
  First stuff the turkey with your favorite stuffing mix. Then paint the
  turkey with the prepared turkey basting agent (see index). Gently place the
  stuffed and painted bird in the flour dusted roasting bag and place into a
  glass microwave roasting pan.  Enter the weight of the turkey on your
  microwave computer.  For example, a 12 lb, 8 oz bird will cook in the
  microwave oven 115-121 minutes at 70% power. Standing time will be 57-60
  minutes. Dividing the time into fourths, the bird will cook at 70% power
  for about 29 minutes on its breast side; turn the dish and cook another 29
  minutes.  Now carefully turn the bird upside down (there will be a lot of
  juices in the bag, so be extra careful). With the bird breast side up, cook
  another 29 minutes at 70% power.

  (Continued from part 1)
  
  Turn the roasting pan around again to cook for the remaining 29 minutes at
  70% power.
  
  Carefully remove bird from roasting bag, saving the juices for the gravy.
  Remove the stuffing at this point and place in a covered dish to keep warm.
  Cover the bird loosely with a tent of tin foil and leave alone for 1 hour
  to let the bird finish cooking. Carve and serve. Refrigerate any leftovers
  in a plastic sack or a Tupperware container. The meat will remain moist and
  juicy for several days.
  
  If your bird is smaller or larger than the example given and you do not
  have a meat microwave computer, adjust the times accordingly. This seems
  like a lot of work but it really is worth the effort.

      1    Lg Kettle (10-12 qt.)               1    Parsnip,
           -Water; cover and bring             1 bn Carrot
           -to a boil                          1 bn Dill
           -Prepare                            1 bn Parsley; (a bunch of each).
      1    Lg Onion,                      
 
  Put the chicken in the pot and cover with water. When the soup comes to a
  boil, skim off the top, add the veggies, turn down to a simmer.
    Keep the lid askew, and season to taste. It's wonderful and freezes well.
  Hint: put the dill and parsley in the mesh onion bag, to make for easier
  removal.
    Most would say to throw the veggies out, but I like to eat the carrots
  and the onion. The chicken is great in sandwiches or salad. I love it hot
  by itself, but you can put pieces in the soup when you serve. Add rice or
  noodles (cooked elsewhere) and of course there's always matzo balls. Enjoy,
  
  NOTE:  If you can't find a fowl, use a Perdue Oven Roaster, cut up. A
  butcher gave me this tip once and I now use it all the time. He cut it up
  too.

  1 1/4 c  Rice; cooked                        3 c  Chicken; cooked and cut up
      1 ea Onion, small; chopped               1 ea Ham, thick slice; cubed

  Prepare rice according to directions or your desire.
   Set aside. Cut up the chicken into small chunks and cook through, either
  on the stove top or the microwave.  You can either cook it and then cut it
  up, or cut it up and then cook it. Chop onion and peppers into small
  pieces.  Saute onion and pepper in the butter for about 4 minutes or until
  tender. Cut up the ham slice into small cube-like pieces.
   (Although, any kind of ham, sliced, diced, cubed, would do). Stir in the
  cooked chicken, cubed ham, soup (straight from the can), and the milk. Heat
  until chicken is hot, stirring frequently. Stir the rice into the mixture
  and cook another few minutes until everything is hot. Be sure to mix in
  rice thoroughly. Will keep well if you prepare ahead and reheat before
  serving.  Just be sure to heat it and mix it again well before serving.
  Freezes well also if you want to make an extra batch.

      1 tb Curry powder                             ----------------------------
      2 tb Crunchy peanut butter               6    Chicken breast halves,
    1/2 c  Soy sauce                                boned, skinned, and cut
    1/2 c  Freshly squeezed lime juice              into 1/2" wide strips
      2    Garlic cloves, minced         

--------------------------------PEANUT SAUCE--------------------------------
    2/3 c  Crunchy peanut butter               4    Garlic cloves, minced
  1 1/2 c  Coconut milk, unsweetened         1/4 c  Chicken broth
    1/4 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice      1/4 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Soy sauce                                Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Molasses (or brown sugar)                Grated lime zest
      1 ts Fresh ginger root, grated                Fresh cilantro sprigs
 
  To make the marinade, combine the first 7 ingredients in a shallow dish.
  Thread the chicken strips onto bamboo skewers in a serpentine fashion.
  Place the skewers into the soy sauce mixture and let marinate in the
  refrigerator at least 2 hours, although overnight is preferable.
  
  Make the peanut sauce by combining the next 7 ingredients (peanut butter
  through garlic) in a saucepan.  Season to taste with cayenne pepper.  Cook
  over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce is as thick as
  heavy cream (about 15 minutes).  Transfer to a food processor or blender
  and pure briefly.  Add chicken broth and cream and blend until smooth.
  This mixture can be made several hours ahead and stored in the
  refrigerator.  Bring to room temperature before serving.
  
  Prepare moderate-hot charcoal coals or preheat a broiler.
  
  Cook the skewered chicken, turning several times and basting with the
  marinade, until crispy on the outside but still moist on the inside, about
  8 minutes.  Sprinkle grilled chicken with lime zest and garnish with
  cilantro leaves.  Serve with the peanut sauce for dipping.

      Title: Agression Cookies
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      3 c  Brown sugar                         3 c  Flour
      3 c  Margarine                           1 tb Baking soda
      6 c  Oatmeal                             2 c  Chocolate chips
 
  Put the ingredients in large bowl. Mash, squeeze, knead, etc until it is
  completely blended. Form into small balls about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in size.
  Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Butter the bottom of a small glass and
  dip into white sugar, then pound the cookies flat. Bake at 350 degrees for
  about 10 to 12 minutes. This is a good recipe to use when you need to get
  rid of some agressions because the dough is too heavy for most mixers. So
  you have to use your hands and beat it!! You can also use peanut butter or
  butterscotch chips or a mixture of them.

  5 3/4 c  Flour                               1 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Baking soda                    
 
  Makes 2-3 Medium-sized houses.
  
     Pour melted Crisco into mixing bowl. Cool slightly; add sugar and Karo,
  blending well. Add eggs, mixing all until smooth and creamy. Put salt,
  baking soda and spices into mixture and begin to add flour, just a little
  at a time. DON'T HURRY THIS STEP! Continue adding as much flour as the
  dough will absorb. Bake house pieces at 375 degrees for 5-8 minutes. Hints:
  Make permenant pattern pieces of mylar or other plastic sheet. To roll out:
  Use heavy duty foil (splash a few drops of water under it so it will stay
  stationary), roll the dough out, cut into desired shapes that are 1" apart.
  Remove the excess dough. Place the foil holding the pieces to bake on a
  cardboard, place in oven and REMOVE THE CARDBOARD BEFORE SHUTTING OVEN
  DOOR. If pieces bake together, cut apart immedietely after removing from
  oven. Windows: Must be cut before baking. Can add crushed hard candy for
  "glass" To Assemble" Use royal Icing: 1 1/2 c warm water, 12 Tbsps Meringue
  powder, 4 pounds powdered sugar. Beat the water and mer.powder til frothy.
  Add as much p. sugar as necassary. Do not make icing stiff or house will
  not hold together as long. Using #5 tip, squeeze out icing on both sides of
  back of house. Stand it up and add sides. Prop with cans of soup, ect., if
  it doesn't stay firmly together. Place icing on ends of standing sides and
  add house front. Let dry for 10-15 minutes, then add roof and chimney.
  Decorate with desired candies using royal icing to place decorations on.
  Let dry and store covered away from dust. Source: an out-of-print book,

      Title: Hungarian Chocolate Cream Bars
 Categories: Cookies, Chocolate, Hungarian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      4 lg Eggs, separated                   3/4 c  Sweet butter, room temp.
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar                     9 tb Cocoa powder
    2/3 c  Sugar, divided                    1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 c  Heavy cream                         1 tb Powdered instant coffee
     12 oz Semi-sweet chocolate chips        1/8 c  Rum

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
      5 oz Semi-sweet chocolate                1 ts Vegetable oil
      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate               1 tb Karo syrup
      4 tb Sweet butter                   
 
   Of all my recipes, this is the only one that I have never given out-its
  raves convinced me in earlier years to keep it only as my own. It is
  singularly the best chocolate dessert I have ever tasted!
  
   Editor's Note: This recipe contains rum. If you prefer not to use rum, the
  brownies still taste fantastic.
  
   To make cake: preheat oven to 350. Grease 9 x 13-inch pan. Line pan with
  wax paper and grease the wax paper.
  
   Beat the egg whites lightly, add cream of tartar and beat at a high speed.
  When shiny, gradually add 1/3 cup of sugar, continuing to beat until stiff.
  
   In a separate mixing bowl, place the egg yolks, remaining sugar and butter
  and beat until light and fluffy. Add the cocoa and mix thoroughly. Add a
  large dollop of egg whites to chocolate mixture and whip until blended.
  Then pour the rest of the egg whites over the egg mixture and sprinkle the
  flour over the egg whites. Fold gently with a spatula until the egg whites
  and flour are incorporated.
  
   Immediately spread the batter in the prepared pan. Smooth out to edges and
  corners. Bake 10-15 minutes at 350 until cake is done. Run a knife around
  edges and invert cake on a wire rack to cool.
  
   To make filling: in a saucepan, combine cream, chocolate chips and instant
  coffee. Cook over low heat until mixture is smooth and slightly thickened.
  Cover saucepan and refrigerate until very cold. When chilled, add rum and
  whip in a chilled bowl at medium speed until firm. Be careful not to over
  beat or the filling may separate.
  
   To make glaze (do not make this until all other steps are completed): in a
  small saucepan, melt all ingredients over a low flame. Mix until very
  smooth. Cool for 15 minutes and mix again. Use immediately, as the sauce
  thickens as it cools.
  
   To assemble, cut cake horizontally into halves. Lightly sprinkle bottom
  half with rum. Spread filling over bottom layer. Place top layer on bottom
  half and spread filling over top. Refrigerate or freeze until very firm.
  When very cold, set the cake on a wire rack. Pour the warm glaze over the
  cake. Refrigerate again until firm. Cut with a sharp knife, wiping the
  blade after each cut. You can freeze cut squares.

      Title: Great-Shape Cookies
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 30 servings
 
    1/2 c  Butter                              2 x  Large eggs
      1 c  Granulated sugar                    1 tb Milk

-------------------------KNEAD IN 1/4 C FLOUR LATER-------------------------
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour,save 1/4 c      1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 ts Baking powder                     1/2 ts Almond
    1/4 ts Salt                           
 
  CHILL DOUGH SEVERAL HOURS OR OVERNIGHT: Could put the dough in the freezer
  to chill, if in a hurry, for 1-2 hours. Heat oven to 300 degrees. Grease
  cookie sheet (only ONCE). No need to grease it each time.
    Add ingredients together, saving out the 1/4 cup of flour. Knead the 1/4
  cup flour into the dough now, chill. Roll out, using flour on surface,
  cutters and rolling pin, generously. Try to get more flour on tiny places.
     This is a great recipe for the creased cookie cutters, because it is
  delicious and dough does not lose its shape. For this type of cutter, roll
  to about 1/4" thickness, so dough is just thick enough to leave the cutter
  imprints. Ordinarily, roll dough to 1/4" thickness for best results. Any
  cookie will lose detail and shape when it is too thick. This cookie is good
  iced with thin royal icing. Cookie stays soft, but is not terribly fragile.
  Source: Shared with me by Mary Billersen of Cin. because I helped her
  replace some favorite cookie cutters she'd lost. These cookies have been a
  tradition in her family for generations. Dolores McCann, Hamilton OH

   Melt chocolate and butter over very low heat. Stir frequently. Remove from
  heat and cool.
  
   Preheat oven to 325.
  
   In a medium size bowl, beat eggs until light. Continue beating, and

  chocolate-butter mixture. Stir in the flour, then nut meats.
  
   Baking options: For 9 giant brownies, bake in 9 x 9-inch pan; for 12 large
  brownies or 24 small ones, bake in 9 x 13-inch pan. Prepare pans by
  greasing and flouring. Bake 45-60 minutes depending on how fudgy or
  cake-like you prefer them). Don't bake beyond the point that a toothpick
  comes out a bit wet.
  
   These can be served out of the pan. Allow to cool completely before
  cutting. To remove from pan, cool 15 minutes after removing from oven, then
  loosen edges and turn over as you would remove a cake. Set top up to cool
  completely.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
 20 1/2 oz Box Brownie mix                   2/3 c  Chocolate chips or*

-----------------------------------ICING-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter, room temperature            1 c  Confectioners sugar
    1/4 ts Salt                           10 1/2 oz Chocolate fudge topping
      1 ts Peppermint extract             
 
  * chopped walnuts
  
   Brownies
  
   Brownies have been an American favorite for close to one hundred years.
  Time your brownies carefully so they do not come out too "wet" or "dry":
  test for doneness several times during baking.
  
   Your guests won't know you've used a packaged brownie mix for this one-and
  don't tell them.
  
   Prepare brownies as directed on package, stirring chocolate chips or
  walnut pieces into batter before baking. Let brownies cool, cut into 1
  1/2-inch squares and refrigerate for 2 hours.
  
   To prepare icing, cream together butter, salt, peppermint extract and
  confectioners sugar until smooth. Spread over brownies. Let icing set.
  
   Spread chocolate fudge topping over the top of each frosted brownie
  square. Place the brownies in the freezer for 5-10 minutes. Remove and
  serve or keep in a cool spot until serving.

      1 c  Butter, melted                      2 c  Flour
      2 c  Light brown sugar                 1/2 ts Salt
      3    Eggs                            1 1/2 ts Baking powder
      2 ts Vanilla                             1 c  Chopped walnuts, pecans, etc

    1/2 c  Butter                              2 ts Instant coffee*
      3 c  Sifted confectioners sugar     
 
  * dissolved in 2 Tablespoons hot water
  
   These chewy squares ooze brown sugary butterscotch. They becrumb the lips
  and besmear the chin, like home-baked goodies should.
  
   Preheat oven to 350.
  
   Melt butter in a large saucepan. Add sugar and beat well to mix. Cool the
  mixture slightly, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.
  
   Sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Stir it into the wet
  ingredients, then add the nuts. Mix well. Spread brownies in a greased 11 x
  7 x 2-inch pan and bake at 350 for 30 to 35 minutes or until a light gold.
  Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out. This is easiest if you
  up-end the pan over waxed paper, then turn the cake right side up. Let it
  finish cooling on a rack.
  
   To make the frosting, cream 1/2 cup butter with confectioners sugar. Beat
  it until light, then beat in the coffee mixture. Spread over the brownies.
  When frosting has set, cut in squares.

      1 c  Butter                             10 oz Slivered blanched almonds**
 
  * firmly packed ** (2 1/2 - 3 cups)
  
   These cookies go well with after dinner coffee or tea.
  
   In a bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, salt and baking soda
  and set aside.
  
   In a large bowl, cream the butter. Add the coffee, almond extract,
  granulated and brown sugars and beat well. Add the eggs one at a time until
  smooth after each addition. On low speed gradually add the sifted dry
  ingredients, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only until
  the mixture is smooth. Gently mix in the almonds.
  
   Spread out two pieces of wax paper. place large spoonfuls of the dough
  lengthwise on each piece of paper to form heavy strips about 10-11 inches
  long. Fold the long sides of the paper p against the dough and, pressing
  against the paper with your hands, shape each strip of dough into a smooth
  oblong 12 inches long, 3 inches wide, and about 1 inch thick. Wrap the
  dough in the wax paper.
  
   Slide a cookie sheet under both packages of dough and transfer them to the
  freezer or refrigerator for several hours or overnight. This slices best
  when dough is frozen solid.
  
   Preheat oven to 375. Unwrap one roll of dough at a time. Place dough on a
  cutting board. With a very sharp knife cut the dough into 1/4-inch slices
  and place them 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.
  
   Bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes at 375. The cookies are done
  when they are slightly colored and spring back when lightly pressed with a
  fingertip.

      Title: Almond Lace Rolls
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    3/4 c  Unblanched almonds,*                1 tb (rounded) flour
    1/2 c  Butter                              1 tb Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Sugar                               1 tb Milk
 
  * finely ground
  
   These cookies require precision timing and fast action but the results are
  worth the trouble. I make them for holidays and special occasions, but they
  are delicious anytime.
  
   Preheat oven to 350. Butter and flour baking sheet.
  
   In a small, heavy pan, place all ingredients. Cook over low heat, stirring
  constantly until butter melts. Drop by teaspoonful: onto baking sheet (do
  not bake more than six at one time).
  
   Bake at 350 for 7-9 minutes. Cookies should be only slightly brown and
  still bubbling at the center. Let cool only for a minute or so until the
  edge is firm enough to lift with a thin spatula Then, working quickly, lift
  cookies and turn them top side down onto paper towels. Roll over the handle
  of a wooden spoon to get a cylinder shape and let cool until crisp.
  
   Use a fresh cookie sheet for each baking to avoid cookies sticking on
  sheet. If cookies get too firm to roll over the spoon handle, place back in
  the oven for a few moments.
  
   Store cookies in an airtight cookie jar or tin. They will keep for a long
  time, and can be made well ahead of the holiday season.
  
   Variations: These cookies also can be left flat-make them smaller if you
  do that; however, they don't have the flair of the rolled lacy effect. Or
  roll ends of cooled cookies in melted chocolate.

      2 c  Unsifted flour                 
 
   These cookies have been a "must" on my family's holiday table since I was
  a little girl. My earliest memories of "birds in the nest" take me back to
  my maternal grandmother's house where she filled each "nest" according to
  the favorite jelly flavor of each of her grandchildren.

  water, flour, vanilla and salt. Mix well and compress into a ball.

  unbeaten egg whites, then roll in ground nuts. Slightly flatten ball to
  form disk, then press finger in center to form a small well. Fill the well
  with a drop of jelly. (Don't put in to much or it will melt over the side
  of the cookie.)
  
   Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes on a greased cookie sheet Remove from oven
  and cool cookies on wire racks.

  2 1/2 c  Sugar                               4 ts Almond extract
      4 ts Baking powder                            Almond halves for garnish

      1 lb Shortening                     
 
   These delicate cookies melt in your mouth and are the perfect
  accompaniment to a Chinese banquet.
  
   In a large bowl, sift the flour, sugar, baking powder and baking soda

  blended, add beaten eggs and almond extract. If mixture is sticky, add one
  or two more tablespoons flour.

  portions. Shape each portion into a log about 1-inch in diameter. Wrap in
  plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour.
  
   Preheat oven to 350. Lightly grease baking sheets.
  
   Remove logs from refrigerator and cut each log into pieces 3/4- inch
  thick. Use your hands to roll each slice into a ball. Place the balls on
  cookie sheets and flatten slightly with your finger tips. Brush gently with
  beaten egg and place half an almond in the center of the cookie.
  
   Bake at 350 for 12-15 minutes (do not allow cookies to brown they should
  be almond colored). Remove from oven and let cookies cool on cookie sheets
  for about two minutes, then remove to racks to cool completely. (They tend
  to crumble if you remove immediately to racks.) Store in tightly covered
  tins.
  
   Note: These cookies may be frozen for up to 2 months Thaw in original
  wrapping and, if desired, freshen in a warm oven for 4-5 minutes.

      1 c  Butter                              1 pt Sour cream
      1 c  Shortening                          3    Egg yolks
  6 1/4 c  Flour                               1 pn Salt
      2 tb Yeast                         

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
    1/2 lb Ground walnuts                      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/4 c  Sugar                               3    Egg whites, stiffly beaten
    1/4 ts Cinnamon                      

----------------------------------EGG WASH----------------------------------
      1    Egg yolk                                 Extra sugar*
           Few drops water                
 
  * for the pastry board
  
   This legacy from my Hungarian grandmother links my children to their Old
  World heritage in a most pleasing way! No one can eat only one of these
  rich little crescents. Make sure you let the dough chill overnight to make
  it easy to work with.
  
   Editor's Note: You may want to cut recipe in half for a smaller yield.
  
   In a bowl, cut the butter and shortening into the flour until the mixture
  is crumbly. In a separate bowl, mix the yeast into sour cream, then add egg
  yolks and salt. Combine with the flour mixture. Mix until smooth and the
  sides of the bowl are clean.
  
   Form into a large ball and chill, covered, overnight.
  
   To make filling, mix walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and stiffly beaten
  egg whites together in a bowl. To make egg wash mix egg yolk and few drops
  of water in a small bowl.
  
   Preheat oven to 350. Sprinkle granulated sugar onto a pastry board.
  Divide the dough into six portions. Work with one portion at a time,
  refrigerating the dough you are not using. Roll out the dough to 1/8-inch
  thick and sprinkle with more sugar. Cut into 2 x 2-inch squares. Place a
  bit of the nut filling along one end of the square and roll up. Form into a
  crescent. Place seam side down on a greased cookie sheet. Paint with egg
  wash. Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on wire
  racks.

      1 ts Cinnamon                       
 
   There are a great variety of shapes and fillings you can use when making
  hand shaped cookies. They tend to be more time consuming to make than other
  types of cookies because each one must be individually shaped. It's well
  worth the extra time, and you may find you enjoy shaping the cookies as
  much as eating them!
  
   Dark, fragrant, dunk-them-in-milk-or-coffee cookies-like great grandmother
  used to bake.
  
   In a large bowl, cream margarine or shortening with sugar. Add egg and
  blend. Add molasses and spices; mix well. Add flour and baking soda and
  blend. Chill dough 30 minutes or overnight (covered tightly).
  
   Preheat oven to 325. Shape dough into small balls, roll in sugar and
  place 2-inches apart on cookie sheet. Bake at 325 for 10-12 minutes.

  1 1/4 c  Ground walnuts                           Confectioners sugar
 
   Legend has it that bakers started making pastry in the form of crescents
  following the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683.
  
   Preheat oven to 350.
  
   In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar and ground walnuts. Make a little well
  in the flour mixture and add the egg yolks. Cut butter into small pieces
  and add to the flour mixture. Knead thoroughly and shape into a ball. Add
  flour, if needed, to prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl.
  
   Cut the ball in 4 parts and shape each part in a roll about inch thick.
  Cut 1/4-inch pieces and form small crescents in the palm of your hand.
  Place crescents on a greased baking sheet and bake about 9-10 minutes,
  until light brown.
  
   While still warm, roll the crescents in the confectioners sugar (be
  careful, they break very easily), then place them on a board to cool. Store
  in a cookie tin. The flavor actually improves with time.

      Title: Christmas Angel Cookies
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 c  Shortening                        1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Cream cheese, softened            1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Light brown sugar,*                 1 tb Vanilla
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar                    2 c  Candied fruit, mixed
      2    Eggs                                2 c  Broken pecans or almonds
      3 c  Flour                          
 
  * firmly packed
  
   The cream cheese gives these cookies a smooth texture, while the fruits
  sparkle and sweeten the flavor. Nice for using the candied fruits that
  didn't make it into the fruit cake.
  
   Preheat oven to 350.
  
   In a large bowl, cream shortening and cream cheese until smooth and
  fluffy. Add sugars and eggs, mixing well. In a seperate bowl, sift flour,
  baking soda and salt together.
  
   Add flour mixture to egg and sugar mixture; add vanilla. Mix well. Add
  candied fruit and nuts.
  
   Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto lightly oiled cookie sheet and bake at 350
  for about 10-12 minutes. The cookies will be just browned at the edges.
  
  Hint: You may have to mix candied fruit and nuts in with your hands; a
  little shortening on your fingers will keep the mixture from sticking.

  3 1/2 c  Flour                          
 
   A last minute substitute gave a new twist to an old Amish recipe for
  raisin cookies. The cupboard was bare so leftover pineapple was substituted
  for the raisins. Everyone preferred the pineapple version. (Editor's Note:
  We called these Pineapple Muffins Cookies, because they came out big and
  soft.)
  
   Preheat oven to 350.
  
   In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening, sugar and egg. When light and
  fluffy, stir in crushed pineapple with juice.
  
   Sift flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg together and stir into batter.
  When the mixture is well blended, stir in nuts.
  
   Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350
  for 8-10 minutes. Cool on wire racks.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Benne (sesame) seeds              1/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed               3/4 c  Butter or margarine, melted
      1 c  All-purpose flour                   1    Egg
    1/4 ts Baking powder                       1 ts Vanilla
 
   Known as sesame seeds in most of the country, "benne" is the name
  southerners learned to call these seeds, which were brought from Africa by
  slaves. Toasting benne seeds develop their flavor and also gives these
  cookies a slightly crunchy texture.
  
   Heat oven to 375. Toast benne seeds on ungreased baking sheet until light
  brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Watch closely so they don't burn.
  
   In a large bowl, mix all ingredients. Drop dough by 1/2 teaspoonfuls 1 1/2
  inches apart onto greased baking sheet. Bake at 375 until light brown,
  about 4-6 minutes. Cool about 2 minutes before removing from baking sheets
  to wire rack to cool completely. Store in tightly covered cookie tin when
  thoroughly cooled.

      Title: World's Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
 Categories: Cookies, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar                    3 c  Flour
      1 c  Brown sugar                       3/4 ts Baking soda

      2    Eggs, slightly beaten               1 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
 
   This recipe is said to have come from a famous cookie maker. So make,
  bake, and compare to see if these cookies aren't "the real thing." One
  feature that distinguishes these cookies from traditional chocolate chip
  cookies is their perfect size. It comes from using a small size ice cream
  scoop to drop them onto the cookie sheet.
  
   Preheat oven to 350.
  
   In a large bowl, combine sugars; add in butter and cream together with the
  sugar. Add vanilla and eggs; mix together.
  
   In a separate bowl sift the dry ingredients and add to the creamed
  mixture. Mix well; the dough will be stiff. Add the chocolate chips and
  nuts (if using).
  
   Line the cookie sheets with baking parchment or wax paper. Drop dough with
  a small ice cream scoop onto the sheets. Bake 10-12 minutes at 350. Remove
  from oven and cool on wire racks.
  
   Variation: For ice cream sandwiches, turn one cookie face down, place a
  scoop of ice cream on it and top with another cookie.

    1/2 lb Confectioners sugar*                3 dr Red food color
  1 1/2 tb Milk                                3 dr Yellow food color
 
  * (2 cups loosely packed)
  
   Children will love these-they are fun to make and to eat. Adults will also
  find them irresistible.
  
   Preheat oven to 375.
  
   In large bowl, with mixer at low speed, beat egg yolks and milk until well
  blended. Add flour, sugar, butter, vanilla and salt; beat ingredients until
  just mixed. Increase speed to medium and beat 2 minutes, occasionally
  scraping bowl. Divide dough in half.
  
   On floured pastry cloth, with lightly floured stockinette- covered rolling
  pin, roll one dough half 1/8-inch thick. With 2 1/4-inch fluted-edged
  cookie cutter, cut dough into rounds; with 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out
  centers from half of rounds. Reserve the dough scraps.
  
   Using a pancake turner, place rounds 1/2-inch apart on un- greased cookie
  sheets; bake at 375 8-10 minutes until lightly browned. With pancake
  turner, remove cookies to wire racks to cool completely.
  
   Repeat cutting and baking with second half of dough, rerolling scraps.
  
   Prepare frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, place all frosting
  ingredients (except food color) and beat at low speed for 2 minutes. Scrape
  sides of bowl and continue beating at high speed for 6 minutes. Divide
  frosting into thirds and tint with food color.
  
   On bottom side of cookie without a hole, spread teaspoonful of either
  green, pink or yellow frosting; top with a cookie with a hole in it to make
  a "sandwich." Repeat with remaining cookies and frosting. (Use any leftover
  frosting for graham crackers or cupcakes.)

      1 c  Sugar                               1 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Ground walnuts                    1/2 ts Ground cloves
      2    Egg yolks                          10 tb Sweet butter

-----------------------------------ICING-----------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Confectioners sugar                 2 tb Lemon juice
      1    Egg white                           2 dr Yellow food coloring (opt.)
 
   A must on your Christmas cookie tray. Despite the lemony frosting, the
  cinnamon flavor comes through.
  
   On a pastry board, mix flour, sugar and walnuts. Form a mound, make a well
  and add the egg yolks, lemon rind and spices. Cut the butter in small
  pieces and add to the flour mixture. Knead thoroughly to make a smooth
  dough.
  
   Let dough rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
  
   Preheat oven to 350. Roll dough out with a rolling pin to 1/8- inch thick
  and cut into star shapes with a cookie cutter. Bake at 350 until cookies
  are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let cool and decorate with the
  icing.
  
   To make icing, mix sugar, egg white, lemon juice and yellow food coloring
  (if using) in a bowl until very smooth. (Icing has to be thick enough so it
  will not run off stars.) Spread evenly with a pointed knife on the stars.
  Let icing dry overnight. Store in a cookie tin.
  
  Note: If you like a less sweet cookie, omit the icing.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Molasses                            3 ts Baking soda
      1 c  White sugar                         1 ts Ground ginger
      1 c  Shortening                          2 ts Cinnamon

      3 c  Confectioners sugar                      Food coloring (optional)
 
   Children love these because the ginger and molasses flavors are not
  overwhelming.
  
   In a large bowl, mix molasses, sugar, shortening and hot water. Stir to
  combine thoroughly, although shortening doesn't need to melt completely.
  
   In a separate bowl, mix baking soda, ginger and cinnamon with 4 cups of
  flour. Mix into liquids, stirring to blend well. Gradually add enough of
  the additional flour to make a dough stiff enough to roll. Chill 1-2 hours
  before baking.
  
   Preheat oven to 350. Grease cookie sheets. Roll out dough to about
  1/6-inch thick and cut shapes with your favorite cookie cutter. Bake 8-11
  minutes at 350 until done. Cool completely and frost with decorative
  frosting. Cookies can also be dusted with decorative sugar or sprinkles
  prior to baking.
  
   To make frosting, beat egg whites until frothy, then beat in sugar and
  vanilla. If you like, separate the icing into several bowls and add a drop
  or two of food coloring. To yellow, add 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract.
  
  Yield: 7-10 dozen, depending on size of cookie cutters. Martina Boudreau,

  Stir until sugar is conpletely blended.  Turn into 8 inch square pan and
  pat flat with fingers.  Cool, and cut into squares when cooled.
  
  This fudge has a less overwhelmingly sweet taste in comparison with those
  that use sweetened chocolate. Its quick to make, harder to double.

      Title: Hurry Tuna, Please
 Categories: Casseroles, Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           -----INGREDIENTS-----             1/2 c  Milk
      1    Large 12-1/2-ounce can white        1 c  Chicken bouillon; (that's
           Or light meat tuna, drained              -one cube of bouillon in one
      2 tb Vegetable Oil                            -cup of water)
      1    Apple; cored and chopped            1    (8-ounce) package egg
      1 sm Onion; chopped                           Noodles; cooked & drained
    1/2 ts Curry                                    Or
      3 tb Flour                               1 c  Cooked rice
 
  THIS MEAL IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WRECK AND QUICK TO MAKE
  
       Fry the apple and onion in a little oil until lightly cooked. Add
  flour and slowly stir in milk and bouillon. That will make a lumpy white
  sauce.  (The lumps are from the apple and onions and are not your fault.)
  Add tuna, breaking it up well, and sprinkle in the curry. Mix well. Serve
  over hot noodles which take nine minutes to cook and should have been
  started back while the apples and onions were cooking. If time is not a
  problem, serve this over rice.  (Now that should have been started BEFORE
  the apples and onions.)

           -pike, carp, etc                    2 tb Matzo meal
      3    Onions; sliced                      1    Salt to taste
           Celery stalk; sliced                1    White pepper to taste

      1    White pepper; to taste              1 bn Beets; sliced (optional)
 
  Have fish man grind: 5 lbs.fish filets-equal amounts; white fish and
  pike;and a small amount of carp or buffle carp; In a large kettle:
  heads,bones,and trimmings of fish; 3 onions,sliced; 1 celery stalk,sliced;
  2 large carrots,sliced; water to cover; salt to taste; white pepper to
  taste;  Bring to boil.  While this is simmering prepare the fish.
    Combine in Food Processor: 1 onion; 4 eggs; add mixture to: ground fish;
  2 tbs.matzo meal ; salt to taste; white pepper to taste; 1/4 cup water;
  Shape fish mixture into balls. I used to do this by hand; chopping in a
  large wooden bowl with a hack messer. Be CARFUL, you don't want mush but
  distinct tiny peices.
    Take another pan; and layer the beets on the bottom; some sliced carrots,
  onions, fish; repeat with everything but the beets. end eith some carrots.
  Pour the broth from the OTHER kettle over the fish. Simmer,covered for 2
  hours.  When cool,remove fish balls to platter and garnish with sliced
  cooked carrots. Strain broth and chill.
   Serve with jellied fish broth and fresh ground horseradish. NOTE: The
  beets are unusal but my Mom and Bubbe ALWAYS used them. They do two things;
  keep the fish from 'catching' on the bottom and give the broth a ruby red
  color; but not the fish; they remain white.
  
  I have never served it with anything but plain freshly grated horseradish.

 Categories: Appetizers, Ethnic, Fish/sea
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lg Jar gifilte fish; good brand        2 lg Onions
      1 bn Beets                                    -Pepper; lots
      1 bn Carrots                                  -Salt; to taste
 
  Here is the EASY way out...        Take a large jar (at least 8 pieces but
  I usually do 12)...but first get your veggies ready; slice the carrots,
  beets and onions. Layer in a heavy stock pot, the beets (my Bubbe's secret
  ingredient), slices of fish, onions, carrots and seasonings; repeat as many
  times as is necessary with EVERYTHING but the beets. Pour the liquid from
  the jar over the fish and then bring to a boil. Turn down as simmer for
  about 45 minutes. Cool, remove from liquid and serve.
  
  This tastes ALMOST a good as the real thing...try it you'll like it.

 Categories: Ethnic, Pasta
      Yield: 10 servings
 
     16 oz Noodle; cooked package/fine         1 c  Sour cream
      6    Eggs                                1 c  Cottage cheese
    1/2 c  Sugar; to taste                          Salt; to taste
      1    Margarine; melted                 1/2 c  Raisins ; optional golden
 
  Cook the noodles according to the directions on the package, drain well.
  Add the other ingredients and mix until combined. Put into a 9 x 13 baking
  dish (greased) and bake at 350 degrees for an hour. Never fails.
  
  You can serve with fruit (fresh) or put pie filling over it. Try putting
  some sour cream on top. Enjoy You can incorperate the egg yolks and beat
  the whites for a very light texture. I sometimes add a bit of lemon juice.
  
  This is a very forgiving recipe. If you leave the sour cream, sugar and
  raisins out, you have a wonderful salt kugel to serve with chicken or beef.

           Salt; pepper to taste               1 lb Noodles,
    1/4 lb Margarine; parve or            
 
  This is the simplest way to make a kugel and in my mind the best! Combine
  butter with hot cooked noodles, Add eggs and stir until blended in. Season
  to taste. put in 9 x 13 pan and bake at 350 for one hour. Serve with
  roasted anything. It's a forgiving recipe. For a lighter taller kugel..beat
  whites first; but I never do!   This is the good old fashioned way of
  serving what's   'bad' for you but tastes so good. These days i only make
  it for special occasions...like when little Sara comes to dinner.

      1 tb Salt                                2 tb Flour
      2    Whole cloves of garlic            1/4 c  - Cold water
      2 lg Onions; sliced                 
 
  AN EXCELLENT POT ROAST GREAT FOR ENTERTAINING
  
       Dredge the meat in the 1/4 cup flour, season with salt and a little
  pepper if you like.  Brown slowly on all sides in shortening with garlic
  cloves in a heavy kettle. Watch that garlic--when it's brown lift it out!
  Add vegetables, return garlic, season to taste. Add 1/2 cup water. Simmer
  covered, until tender, about 3-1/2 hours. Turn the pot roast occasionally,
  adding more water if needed.  Remove the meat, strain vegetables, and
  measure broth in pot and add enough meat stock to make 2 cups. Blend and
  add the 2 tablespoons of flour and 1/4 cup cold water. Cook, stirring
  constantly, until thickened.

  My favorite meatloaf recipe.
  
  Combine the beef, bread crumbs, onion, 8 oz tomato sauce, egg, My
  Seasoning, and green pepper.  Mix well and place in a loaf pan.
  
  Combine all sauce ingredients.  Cook in a saucepan until butter melts. Pour
  sauce over meat loaf and bake at 350F^. for 1 hour. While baking, the sauce
  needs to be spooned over the meat occasionally.
  
  Note: Make sure you use a pan large enough for the meat and sauce, or the
  sauce will tend to boil over while it is cooking.
  
  My Seasoning: Mix 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part black
  pepper. Mix well before measuring and adding to the recipe.

           1 inch thick                       2 tb Cognac
  1 1/2 tb Crushed black (Java) pepper       1/2 c  Heavy cream (optional)
      1 tb Butter                              2 tb Fresh chopped parsley
    1/4 ts Garlic powder                            Salt
      1 tb Vegetable oil                            Parsley sprigs
 
  This is SOOOO good. I make it without the sour cream and it is SOOOO good
  without the sour cream that it is probably devine with it.  Warning: once
  you start cooking this, you should have your accompaniments ready; the
  cooking goes pretty fast.  I heat up a toaster oven first and when the time
  comes to keep the steak warm, I turn OFF the toaster oven and pop the steak
  in (it JUST fits).
  
  Combine crushed pepper, butter, and garlic into a paste. Spread evenly on
  both sides of the steak.  Heat oil in heavy frying pan over medium high
  heat.  When very hot, add steak and brown evenly on both sides.  Allow 7
  minutes per side for rare, 8 minutes for medium rare, and 9 minutes for
  medium.  Place steak on a serving platter and keep warm.
  
  Deglaze the pan with the wine and cognac and cook 1 minute.  Reduce heat,
  add cream and chopped parsley and continue cooking 1-2 minutes, stirring
  constantly.  Season to taste with salt.
  
  Carve steak diagonally across the grain into thin slices.  Pour the sauce
  over steak and garnish with parsley.

    1/4 c  Vegetable oil                     1/2 ts Thyme
      1 md Onion, finely chopped             1/2 c  Drained stewed tomatoes
      2    Cloves, minced garlic               1 c  Cooked rice**
    1/2 lb Ground beef                         1 tb Parsley
    1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  1. Cut top off each pepper and remove seeds and veins. Blanch in boiling
  water for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and let cool.
  
  2. In a skillet, heat oil, add onion and garlic and saute for 4 to 5
  minutes.
  
  3. Add meat, salt, pepper and thyme and cook until meat is browned.
  
  4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the meat, tomatoes, rice and parsley.
  
  5. Stuff each pepper with the meat mixture, place top back on each and bake
  in a preheated 325 degree F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes.
  
   *You may use yellow or red peppers as a substitute for eye appeal. One of
  my favorite serving tricks to use green, red, yellow peppers in this
  preparation.  Then, use a large, well garnished platter for the cooked
  peppers. If you use a creole type suace, the affect is truely spectacular.
  
  **I have from time to time cut the peppers in half lenghtwise in order to
  add plate coverage. This is especially important if the peppers are small.
  It gives the appearence of quantity with out the bulk.  When I do this I
  increase the cooked rice to 1 1/2 cups.  Your mileage may vary!

  1. In saucepan, mix together gelatine, sugar and salt. Drain mandarin
  oranges; stir syrup into gelatine mixture. Place over low heat; stir

  Tupperware mold, or pretty crystal bowl, can be used.) Refrigerate. Serve.

------------------------------BLETLACH (LEAVES------------------------------
    1/4 ts Salt                                4    Egg
      1 c  Flour                                    Butter
      1 c  Water                         

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 lb Cottage cheese                      1 tb Sugar
      1    Egg yolk                            1 pn Salt
 
  Sift the flour with the salt and salt.   Beat eggs well, add water. Add
  flour gradually to eggs, stirring constantly, until batter is smooth and
  thin. Heat a small frying pan, Teflon makes life easy, and smear with a
  very thin coat of butter. When pan is hot, put in about 1/4 cup batter,
  tilt pan until it covers. Cook until it begins to blister and is shiny.
  Turn out on table cloth. I always use one, but I guess you can use paper
  towels. Continue until all the batter is used. Should make 10 or 12
  circles.
  
  Mix the filling ingredients well. Now it's time to 'build your blintzas' as
  my daughter used to say. Put some filling off center on each circle. Fold
  the bottom up and the top down. Tuck in sides, or fold in, before you put
  the op down. Confused? Just try it, it's easy.
  
  At this point you can store them  in  the fridge, or freeze them. They
  freeze well. To finish, just fry them in a small amount of butter, until
  browned
  
  Great, served with sour cream. They are a bit complicated, but not really
  difficult. and they freeze so well. Use well seasoned pams, 6".

 Categories: Ice cream, Chocolate
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      2 c  Milk                                4 c  Whipping Cream
  1 3/4 c  Sugar                               1 ea Pillsbury Chocolate Chip
    1/2 ts Salt                                1 x  Cookie Dough (large size)
      2 c  Half & Half                         1 x  Or use homemade cookie dough
      1 tb Vanilla Extract                
 
  Take the chocolate cookie dough out of fridge and leave out till needed.
  Scald milk until bubbles form around edge. Remove from heat. Add sugar and
  salt.
   Stir until dissolved.  Stir in half and half, vanilla, and whipping cream.
  Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Freeze as directed by your ice cream
  machine's instructions.  Once ice cream has been through the entire ice
  cream machine process and is now a chilled soft ice cream, add the
  chocolate chip cookie dough. Just break up the dough as best you can with
  your hands and drop it in small clusters into the soft ice cream. Try to
  mix it around to ensure that the cookie dough is evenly distributed
  throughout the ice cream. Put the ice cream in the freezer for several
  hours until hardened. Origin: We pretty much took our vanilla ice cream
  recipe and added the chocolate chip cookie dough.  You can easily use the
  Pillsbury cookie dough, but it's cheaper and better to use homemade. Our
  Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough recipe makes this a especially
  yummy!

      Title: Fettucini Carbonara Ala Fratelli
 Categories: Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      3 sl Bacon, cut into 1" pieces         1/2 c  Romano cheese, grated
      3 tb Onion, diced                        1    Egg yolk
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed              2 x  Servings fettucini, cooked
    3/4 c  White wine                               Chopped parsley for garnish
    3/4 c  Half-and-half                  
 
  In an 10" pan, fry the bacon until the fatty portions are just beginning to
  turn clear.  Add the onion, and saute over high heat until the onion is
  translucent.  Drain off the fat, remove the bacon and onion, and set aside.
  
  Add the garlic to the pan, and deglaze the pan with the wine, scraping up
  any bacon leavings.  Simmer for about 1 minute.  Add the half-and-half to
  the pan, and wait until the sauce come back up to the simmer (with
  practice, this can be done so that the half-and-half does not curdle in the
  wine.  If it does curdle, that's okay - the taste will still be there, it
  just won't look as nice).  Add the Romano cheese (parmesan is acceptable,
  but the taste will be a little more pungent), and stir until smooth, about
  30 seconds.  At this point, the sauce may be removed from the heat and held
  for about 15 minutes.
  
  To serve, bring the sauce back up to temperature.  Add the cooked fettucini
  to the pan and toss to coat the pasta.  Add the bacon, onion and raw egg
  yolk, and toss to mix thoroughly.  Dish onto two plates, garnish with a bit
  of chopped parsley, and serve immediately.

      1 pt Whipping Cream                 
 
  Make a double batch of Gary's Chocolate Pudding increasing the cornstarch
  to about 4 1/2 tb per batch (8-10 total).  Chill thoroughly.  This pudding
  will be extremely thick.
  
  Make or purchase your favorite pie shell.  I personally like the good old
  fashioned, plain pie shell.  My family seems to prefer a cookie type of
  shell.  If you make your own, you must pre-bake it as this pie requires NO
  BAKING.
  
  Whip cream with confectioner's sugar and vanilla extract until thick and
  fluffy.  Take 1/2 of the whipped cream and add to the chocolate pudding.
  Because the pudding is so thick, you will probably want to use an electric
  mixer for this task.  Mix until all of the whipped cream is thoroughly
  incorporated.
  
  Fill pie shell with the pudding-whipped cream mixture.  Place remaining
  whipped cream into a piping bag and pipe onto top of pie.  Shave
  bittersweet chocolate on top as garnish.
  
  Cover pie and place into refrigerator for 2-3 hours to allow the cornstarch
  that is in the confectioner's sugar to set.

      Title: Grandma's Basic White Sauce
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 tb Butter*                           1/4 ts Salt
      1 sm Chopped shallot (about 2 tb)      1/8 ts White pepper
      2 tb Flour                             1/8 ts Fresh ground nutmeg*
  1 1/2 c  Warm milk*                     
 
  In a medium sauce pan melt the butter over moderate heat.  Add the shallot
  and saute, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Lower the heat, add the flour, and
  cook stirring, 3 minutes more or until the roux is golden and bubbling.
  Pour in the milk and bring it to a simmer, stirring constantly, for 5
  minutes or until thickened and smooth.  Add the salt, pepper and nutmeg.
  The recipe makes a scant 2 cup, but easily doubles if you need more.
  
  *We substitute unsalted butter (or Weight Watchers low-fat substitute) for
  Grandma's butter, and use skim milk or 2% lowfat instead of the whole milk
  she used, with no trouble at all.

      Title: Texas Mopping Sauce for Barbecue
 Categories: Sauces, Meats, Poultry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Strong black coffee               1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
      1 c  Tomato catsup                     1/4 c  Butter or margerine
      1 tb Freshly ground black pepper         1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Salt                           
 
  Combine all ingredients and simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring
  frequently.  Store in a tightly covered jar in refrigerator. Heat before
  using.  For ribs, I dunk the ribs in the sauce each time I turn them. This
  sauce is very spicy and some people think it's too strong for poultry; I
  disagree.
  
  The coarser the pepper is ground, the better it is.  Warning:  if this is
  used on country style pork ribs it will make you throw rocks at steak!

      1    Head Chinese (Napa) Cabbage         1    Bunch Green Onions

-----------------------------DRESSING - STEP I-----------------------------
    1/2 c  Seasoned Rice Vinegar               3 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Sesame Oil                    

-----------------------------DRESSING - STEP II-----------------------------
      3 tb Sesame Oil                               pieces, discard seasoning
      3 tb Peanut Oil                        1/2 c  Sliced Almonds

  Prepare greens by chopping up the Napa cabbage and the green onions.  You
  may use a coarse chop or shredd, depending on preference: coarser than most
  cole slaw but not "bite sized" pieces.
  
  Boil together the vinegar, 1/2 cup sesame oil, and sugar.
  
  In a frying pan, add the dressing ingredients listed in Step II and saut
  until the Ramen noodles and sesame seeds are lightly browned.  Mix with the
  sweet oil and vinegar mixture and chill.
  
  Keep greens and dressing separate until ready to serve.  Toss dressing in
  with greens.  You may add cooked chicken if you like.

      Title: Szechuan Green Beans
 Categories: Vegetables, Microwave, Beans
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      6    Garlic cloves, peeled               1 ts Hot red-pepper flakes
      2    Quarter-sized slices ginger         1 tb Soy sauce
      2    Scallions, cut in 2" lengths        1 tb Rice wine vinegar
      1 tb Vegetable oil                       1 lb Green beans, tipped/tailed
 
  Peel garlic and ginger.  Smash garlic.  Trim scallions and cut into 2"
  lengths (don't be fancy, the next step is a food processor). Place garlic,
  ginger, and scallions into a food processor and process until finely
  chopped.  Remove to a 14x11x2" dish.  Add oil and pepper flakes.  Cook in
  microwave, uncovered, at 100% for 3 minutes.
  
  Remove from microwave and stir in remaining ingredients, tossing gently to
  coat green beans.  Cook, uncovered, at 100% for 10-15 minutes, stirring 4-5
  times.
  
  Serve hot or cold.
  
  Notes:  This recipe takes only a tablespoon of oil for a pound of green
  beans.  I have used half that with good success.  These are good cold for
  picnics or between meal snacks.

 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 lg Firm Apples                         1 ts All-purpose flour
      1 c  Maple syrup                       1/2 c  Light cream or
    1/2 c  Water                                    -half-and-half
      1 tb Butter                                   -Pare and core apples.
 
  In a saucepan, combine the syrup and water. Bring to a boil and simmer 3
  minutes. Add the apples and cover. Simmer until the apples are tender but
  not mushy, 3 to 8 minutes. With slotted spoon, lift the apples onto
  individual dessert dihes or plates. Boil syrup until reduced to 3/4 cup.
  Pour syrup into a measuring cup. melt butter in the saucepan. Blend in the
  flour, cream and the syrup. Boil, uncovered, until reduced to 1 cup, about
  3 minutes. Serve warm, or at room temperature. *NOTE- Because the apples
  are pared before cooking, they will cook very quickly. Certain varieties
  might even get mushy all of a sudden. Watch them VERY carefully while
  cooking; it just takes minutes. This dessert is delicious and beatiful when
  you serve one whole apple on a plate surrounded with the maple-and-cream
  sauce. Recipe From:Great Old-Fashioned American Desserts Copyright 1987 by

      2 tb Cornstarch                               -confectioner's sugar
  2 1/2 tb Lemon juice, fresh             
 
    DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
       In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup raspberries, 2 tablespoons sugar
    and grated orange zest. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring and
    mashing the raspberries. Dissolve cornstarch in lemon juice and add to
    raspberry mixture. Cook, stirring, for about 45 seconds, or until
    thickened and no longer cloudy. Remove from the heat and stir in
    chambord or framboise and the remaining 1/3 cup raspberries. Cool to
    room temperature. ( The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point.
    Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Bring to room temperature
    before proceeding. )
       Position rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat oven to
    350 degrees. Lightly coat the inside(s) of a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish
    or six 1 1/2-cup individual souffle dishes with vegetable oil or
    nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with sugar and shake out excess.
       In a large, grease-free mixing bowl, beat egg whites with an
    electric mixer on medium speed until foamy and opaque. Add cream of
    tartar and salt; gradually increase speed to high and beat until soft
    peaks form. Gradually add remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and beat until
    stiff ( but not dry ) peaks form.
       Stir raspberry mixture well. Whisk about one-quarter of the beaten
    egg whites into the raspberry mixture to lighten it. Using a rubber
    spatula, fold the raspberry mixture back into the remaining whites.
    Turn into prepared dish(es) and smooth top(s) with spatula. Place
    dish(es) in a roasting pan. Fill pan with hot water to come one-third
    of the way up side of the dish(es). Bake until puffed and top is firm
    to the touch, about 25 minutes for individual souffles and about 35
    minutes for a large souffle. Dust with confectioner's sugar and serve
    immediately. Serve 6.

  Preheat oven to 350.  Spray a 9" pie plate with nonstick cooking spray and
  set aside.
  
  Spray a medium sized skillet with nonstick cooking spray.  Saut onions and
  green pepper until tender, about 3-5 minutes.  Add turkey and cook until no
  longer pink, breaking the meat up into small chunks as you cook. Stir in
  beans, tomato sauce, and taco seasoning mix.  Set aside.
  
  In a medium bowl, combine cornmeal, sugar, and salt.  In a separate small
  bowl mix the egg, milk, and oil.  Add egg mixture to cornmeal mixture and
  combine well.  Stir in drained corn.  Press the cornmeal mixture into the
  prepared pie plate like a crumb crust.  Spoon the bean mixture on top of
  the cornmeal "crust".  Bake 20 minutes.  Sprinkle the top of the pie with
  grated cheese and bake an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese is
  melted.  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.

                         Spicy Pinto Beans
  
                          by Gayle Hudson
  
  4 cups pinto beans (or mixture of dry beans), washed and sorted 1 yellow
  onion, chopped 1 (28 oz.) can whole (or crushed) tomatoes with juice 3
  cloves garlic, sliced (or to taste) 2 ribs celery, sliced thin 2 smoked ham
  hocks, or about 1 cup chopped ham 1 tbsp chili powder 1 tsp salt 1 tbsp
  ground cumin 1 package instant chicken broth (seasoning), or enough chicken
  stock to fill crock pot with ingredients 1/3 cup Pace Picante sauce
  (medium), optional
  
  Soak beans in water and the salt overnight in enough water to cover (keep
  in mind that beans will expand and should not be exposed above water line).
  In morning, drain, but do not rinse. Add remaining ingredients, stirring
  well to combine thoroughly; picante sauce will give beans a spicy, hot
  flavor. Add enough water or chicken stock to fill to top. Do not use
  instance chicken seasoning if you use chicken stock.
  
  Bring to boil in crock pot (this takes at least one hour at highest
  settings...to speed up process, heat water/stock in microwave, then return
  to pot), then reduce temperature to 350 for the day.
  
  To serve in the evening, I usually start the beans at 6 a.m., bring to boil
  by 7:30 a.m. and cook until 6 p.m. Stir again thoroughly and serve over
  rice or cornbread. Also very good when reheated.

  medallions in small batches until browned, 1 minute per side. Turn only
  once. Remove each batch to an ovenproof serving dish; keep warm in a 225
  degree oven.
  
  3.  Prepare the sauce:  put the skillet, with the meat drippings, on a high
  heat; add the chicken stock and wine. Bring to a boil, scrap- ping and
  stirring until some of the broth evaporates. Keep cooking the sauce until
  thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 6-8 minutes.
  
  4.  Serve the meat with the sauce spooned over the top of each medal- lion.

  I saw this in Parade Magazine the other day. Don't have time to make this.
  Probably time consuming but enjoyable to make if you have the time or the
  weather (who wants to be indoors cooking in the Summer?) Don't make this
  for the creep who puts ketchup on everything. Wouldn't it be annoying after
  spending so much time cooking someone throws some unwanted condiment onto
  the food? Enjoy!!

      Title: Christmas Tiramisu
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 lb Mascarpone or soft cream                 Black coffee (approx)
           Cheese                              9 oz Ladyfingers or 14 oz. angel
    3/4 c  Sugar                                    Food or sponge cake, thinly
      8 lg Egg yolks                                Sliced
    1/2 c  Sweet wine                          1 tb Unsweetened cocoa
      2 c  Expresso or very strong        
 
  1. In a small bowl, using a fork, beat the cheese until creamy. Set aside.
  
  2. Place a large (about 10-12 cups capacity) metal bowl over a pot of
  boiling water. Using a hand-held electric mixer set on medium high, beat
  the sugar and egg yolks in the bowl for 1 minute, or until the mixture is
  well blended. With the mixer set on low speed to prevent splashing,
  gradually add the wine. Continue to cook and beat the mixture, increasing
  the speed to medium and then to high as the mixture thickens. Cook and beat
  for 5-7 minutes, or until the mixture is thickened and light, scraping down
  the sides of the bowl frequently with a rubber spatula.
  
  3. Remove the bowl from the heat and continue to beat the mixture for 1
  minute longer. Beat in the cheese just until blended (makes about 5 cups).
  
  4. Pour one cup of the expresso into a small shallow bowl that is large
  enough to hold a ladyfinger if it is placed horizontally in the bowl.
  
  5. Quickly dip the rounded top side of each ladyfinger into the expresso.
  Only the top half of the ladyfingers should be soaked with the expresso. If
  the ladyfingers get too wet, they will fall apart! Add more coffee to the
  bowl as needed.
  
  6. Place the ladyfingers, flat side down, in the bottom of a 13 x 9 glass
  or ceramic pan. Do not use a metal pan. Form one layer. Pour half of the
  custard mixture over the ladyfingers and spread to cover them. Dip the
  remaining ladyfingers in the expresso (there will be a few remaining ones
  and form a second layer over the custard mixture. Pour the remaining
  custard mixture over the ladyfingers and spread to an even layer.
  
  7. Place the cocoa in a strainer and dust the top of the tiramisu evenly.
  Cover and refrigerate for at least 10 hours.
  
  Makes: 10-12 servings.

    DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
    *** My notes: I think the recipes in this cookbook all assume using a
    whole, uncooked ham. I would omit the step of boiling ham for 3 hours
    if using a cooked ham.
    Pick over and wash dried apples. Cover with water and let soak over
    night or for a number of hours. In the morning, cover ham with cold
    water and let boil for 3 hours. Add the apples and water in which they
    have been soaked and continue to boil for another hour. Add brown
    sugar. Make dumplings by sifting together the flour, salt, pepper and
    baking powder. Stir in the beaten egg, milk (enough to make fairly
    moist, stiff batter), and melted butter. Drop the batter by spoonfuls
    into the hot liquid with the ham and apples. Cover kettle tight and
    cook dumplings for 15 minutes. Serve piping hot on large platter.

    DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
    Mix the currants with some of the flour. Work butter and sugar
    together to a smooth cream, then slowly work in whole eggs one at a
    time. Add a little of the flour, rind and juice of the lemon and salt.
    Work in slowly the rest of the flour and the currants. Drop by
    spoonfuls on large buttered pans, pressing flat with a knife as the
    cakes are better when very thin. A good plan is to heat the pan a bit
    and allow the cakes to melt as much as possible before putting them in
    the oven to bake. Be sure to butter the pans thoroughly; otherwise,
    the thin cakes will be difficult to remove.

    again. Spread on well-greased tins and when light (about 1-1/4 hours)
    brush melted butter over top. Strew with "rivels" made by combining

    water glass or larger if desired. Mix together ingredients for one of
    the fillings. Spread on dough, fold over and bake at 400-F until

    should be served with cocktails. Make the anchovy and caviar
    appetizers somewhat smaller than the ones that are to be served with
    beer.

    DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
    *** My notes:  This is the way I've always made giblet gravy, except
    that I add chopped celery and onion, the neck, and some poultry
    seasoning, salt, and pepper while boiling the giblets. I usually add a
    little Kitchen Bouquet at the end to brown the gravy, also.
    Wash thoroughly the liver, gizzard and heart and cover with water and
    cook until tender. Drain off the water and save. Chop the giblets
    fine. Pour off most of the fat in which the poultry has been cooked,
    leaving about 4 Tbsp of it in the pan. Add 3 Tbsp of flour and blend
    well. Measure the giblet water adding enough water to make 3 cups.
    Pour slowly into the browned flour, stirring constantly until mixture
    thickens. Add giblets and cook for a few minutes. Season with salt and
    pepper and serve.

    DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
    *** My notes: I think the recipes in this cookbook all assume using a
    whole, uncooked ham. I would omit the step of boiling ham for 3 hours
    if using a cooked ham.
    Cover the piece of ham with cold water and set over a low flame to
    cook for 3 hours. Add water from time to time during cooking in order
    to have at least one quart of broth at all times. Wash and clean the
    string beans, break into small pieces and add to the ham. Continue
    cooking about 25 minutes. Pare and quarter the potatoes; add to the
    beans and ham and cook about 25 or 30 minutes, or until beans and
    potatoes are tender. About 15 minutes before serving, add salt and
    pepper to taste. Serve hot, providing vinegar for those who like the
    dish strongly flavored.
