      Title: MES OLIVES PREFEREES (MY SPECIAL OLIVES)
 Categories: Condiments, French, Restaurant/
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        2 c  plain Greek or Italian
  :          olives
        2    shallots -- whole or sliced
        4    cloves garlic, to 5 cloves
  :          barely crushed
  :          thyme, rosemary, fennel seed
  :          chives, sage -- fresh or
  :          dried
      1/2    lemon -- juiced
  :          Worcestershire sauce
  :          Tabasco or hot pepper
  :          flakes
        1 c  olive oil
  
  Place the olives in a jar with a tight-fitting lid.
  
  Add to the jar shallots, garlic, a handful of fresh or dried herbs,
  chopped or left whole, lemon juice, a few shakes of Worcestershire
  sauce and a few drops of Tabasco or shakes of hot pepper flakes.
  
  Pour olive oil to cover the olives and herbs and seal the lid. Shake a
  couple of times to mix all ingredients well. Leave these olives to
  plump in the oil and absorb the perfume of the herbs. As you use them
  replenish the stock with more olives in the same oil mixture until it
  at last seems too tired to do the job. The herb-scented oil is then
  perfect for brushing on grilled foods as they finish or in other
  cooking.

      Title: MESA VERDE (GREEN SAUCE)
 Categories: Mexican, Salsa
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        1 lb fresh green chiles -- diced
        3 TB olive oil
      1/3 c  onion -- diced
        1 TB salt
        1 ts granulated garlic
        1 ts dried leaf oregano
        2 c  Water
        3 TB flour
        2 TB vegetable oil
  
  Fresh green chiles make the best salsa, and frozen ones are sometimes
  available in supermarkets.  If you can't find either, substitute
  canned Ortega Fire-Roasted green chiles. To prepare fresh green
  chiles, roast on a barbecue grill, then peel the skins under running
  water or by rubbing with a wet towel. Remove stem and seeds before
  dicing. Place chiles in a food processor fitted with the metal blade
  and process to puree; set aside. Blend flour with vegetable oil.
  
  Place olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; add onion and
  saute until translucent.  Add salt and spices and reduce heat to
  medium. Add the green chile puree, then water. Bring to a slow boil,
  stirring occasionally. Add the flour/oil mixture gradually, stirring
  constantly, until mixture thickens (you may not need to add all of
  it, depending on the amount of juice in the chiles).  Simmer 2
  minutes, stirring continually to avoid sticking.  Transfer to a
  covered container and refrigerate. Serve chilled. Makes 1 quart.

      Title: MESCLUN SALAD DRESSING
 Categories: Salads, Sauces
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Mesclun greens
      1    Garlic clove
      1    Shallot; chopped
      2 tb Red wine vinegar
      1 tb Balsamic vinegar
      1 ts Dijon mustard
    1/2 c  Olive oil
 
  Just as the ingredients in your salads will change with the seasons,
  your dressing should vary according to the greens. Milder greens such
  as mache are best with a light coating of good olive oil and lemon or
  vinegar. The best dressing is one that highlights the greens, not
  itself. You may want to add a tablespoon of plain yogurt to a basic
  vinaigrette, this will tame the sharper greens.
  
  DIRECTIONS:
  
  1.) Rub salad bowl with garlic.
  
  2.) Mix shallots, mustard, vinegar in bowl.
  
  3.) Pour in olive oil, whisking until blended.  Add mesclun leaves and
  toss.

  uncovered 5 minutes longer.  Pour into 1 1/2 quart casserole. 2. In
  same skillet cook pork chops 2 minutes on each side. Lay chops on top
  of vegetable mixture. 3. Cover with foil and bake 12-15 minutes or
  until chops are done. Studies say that pork (chops, butterfly and
  center) are equal to chicken in fat content if trimmed of all fat.
  You be the judge. I'm very careful and seldom serve pork, but is nice
  for a change which won't hurt you if you serve in moderation.

      Title: MEXICAN BAKED BEANS
 Categories: Beans, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Dried white beans
           Water
      3    Jalapeno peppers, chopped
      1    Green or red pepper, chopped
      1    Onion, chopped
      1 ts Garlic powder (or 2-3 minced
           -cloves garlic)
     29 oz Can crushed tomatoes
  1 1/2 tb Chili powder
      1 ts Cumin
    1/4 c  Molasses
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Cover the beans with water and soak overnight.  In the morning, drain
  the beans and cover with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then simmer
  for about an hour.
  
  Place the peppers, onion, garlic powder or garlic in a saucepan and
  heat, covered, over low heat (no need for oil, the vegetable juices
  that are released will keep everything from sticking to the pan.) Add
  the tomatoes and spices and molasses, and simmer for about ten
  minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Drain the beans and place them in a large casserole dish. Pour the
  tomato mixture over, and stir gently until beans and sauce are mixed.
  Bake, uncovered, for 3 hours, until mixture is no longer soupy, and
  beans are soft.  Serves 6.
  
  Served with 1/2 cup of rice, you have a complete protein, and the dish
  racks up only 446 calories per serving and a measly 1.35 g fat.
  Another suggestion would be to use cooked corn - it adds the same
  number of calories as the rice, and only 1 g fat to the existing 1
  and a smidge. And it's yummy, too.

  :          tabasco sauce -- optional
  :       ts fresh lime juice -- for
  :          accompaniment
  
  Soft flour tortillas, 7 to 9 inch diameter, are filled with potatoes,
  bell peppers, and refried beans. We substituted a can of pintos that
  was preseasoned with a bit of chipotle chili; coarsely chopped rather
  than mashed the beans. This version is spicier than the original. *
  Prepare the potatoes first. Drain and air cool. * Heat a little oil
  in large skillet, saute onion and garlic until softened. Add a most
  of or all of the remaining oil and add the bell peppers, potatoes,
  diced chili, and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes until potatoes are a
  warm brown. Add the beans and mix well.  Season with salt, pepper,
  cilantro, chili powder. Heat through. * Use vegetable spray to
  lightly coat a cookie sheet. Set oven to 350F/180C. * Lay a tortilla
  on a cutting board and fill with 1/4 of the skillet's mixture, along
  one edge so that you can roll the tortilla into a buritto. Place the
  tortilla on the sheet with folded side up; repeat. Use a little
  vegetable spray on each folded tortilla. * Scatter the grated cheese
  on top along the fold.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. ** Meanwhile, mix
  the salsa ingredients in order listed, adding more or less tomato
  juice as needed. Do not add the lime juice at this time. Use a hot
  pepper sauce sparingly to taste. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
  Stir and refresh with lime juice. (Note: leave peel on cucumber for
  more color and fiber. Scrub well.)
  
  Cooks TIP: If tortillas have been in the refrigerator for a while,
  put a splatter screen on top of the pot while the potatoes are
  cooking and soften the tortillas with steam. Wrap in foil, if
  necessary, to keep warm and pliable.

  "Mexican meals don't usually include cake, but this one--made with
  bean puree and lots of fruit and spices--would fit right in with
  Mexican food!" Jean's Beans by Jean Hoare page 112.
  
  BEAN PUREE Start with 1 cup of dried beans or a bit more if using
  large white limas and you plan to take off the skins. Extra bean
  puree may be frozen-it looks like mashed potato. Quick Soak - Wash
  beans, use 3 cups of cold water for each cup of beans and bring
  slowly to a boil. Boil gently for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, cover
  and let stand for 1 hour. Drain off soaking water.
  
  Cover with fresh cold water, bring to a boil for 10 min, reduce heat
  and simmer about 30 min until tender. Drain. Remove lima bean skins
  and discard any hard beans. Grind through a foodmill, puree in a
  blender or food processor.  You may have to add a bit of liquid saved
  from the cooking process to get the mixture moving. Force the puree
  through a sieve about 1/4 cup at a time if you want a very smooth
  puree. Puree only keeps a day or two in fridge so freeze any that you
  are not going to use for the recipe.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour the bottom only of a 9x13 inch
  rectangular pan.
  
  Cream butter with sugar.  Add egg and beat well. Blend in bean puree
  and vanilla.  In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt,
  and spices. Mix with the apple, raisins, and nuts. Add dry
  ingredients and fruit to creamed mixture and blend well.  Pour batter
  into prepared pan and bake 35-45 min or until cake tests done when
  tried with a toothpick.
  
  Mix icing sugar with enough milk or fruit juice to make a thin glaze;
  drizzle over the still-warm cake. Keep in the refrigerator.
  
  (My notes - I would make this again but leave off the glaze as it is
  quite sweet.)  Shared by Elizabeth Rodier, reposted Nov 93.

      2    Flour tortillas
      4    Slices tomato
      2    Leaves lettuce
 
  Mexican Bean Sandwich
  
  Use chili powder to your personal taste.  Salad dressing should be
  low-fat mayonnaise type.  Beans should be cooked, drained, unsalted,
  chopped. (If you use canned beans see the dietary changes below.)
  
  Mix vinegar, chili powder and onion powder with salad dressing in
  bowl. Add beans and celery; mix well. Soften tortillas in heated
  frying pan for about 1 1/2 minutes. Turn if necessary. Place half of
  bean filling onto each tortilla near one edge. Top with lettuce and
  tomato. Roll up.
  
  Makes 2 servings - one sandwich each.
  
  Per serving: 175 calories, 3 g fat (15%), 1 mg cholesterol, 53 mg
  sodium.
  
  If using canned drained beans, sodium will be 318 mg for pinto beans
  and 282 mg sodium for kidney beans.
  
  This combination of raw vegetables and seasonings makes a tasty
  sandwich that's high in fiber and low in fat.

 Categories: Beans/peas, Mexico, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Black beans
      1    Water to cover
    1/4    Cup, chopped fine Onion
      1 ts Cooking oil
      1 ts Cooking oil
    1/2    Chopped fine Onion
    1/4    Cup, chopped Bell pepper
      3    Cloves, diced Garlic
      1    Salt to taste
 
  Wash the beans.  Put A-D in a large pot and cook until tender. Then
  saute E-H in a small pan, and add to the beans. Salt to taste and
  cook about an hour more.
  
  This is a highly modified recipe out of a Mexican cookbook. The author
  suggested a crock pot for about 10 hours. It didn't get the beans
  tender so I put it in a large pot and simmered the beans about an
  hour. The author also said not to soak the beans over night, because
  that would give the beans a strong flavor. I was doubtful, but that
  advice seems to be right.
  
  I also made some nachos with it.  I used about half a cup of cooked
  beans after the first step (A-D).  I mashed them with a spoon, and
  fried in margarine in a small skillet with a few diced onions. I
  sauteed some ground turkey with taco seasoning, and then layered bean
  paste, turkey, and cheddar cheese on chips. Very good. I am thinking
  of making up a batch of beans just to make black bean paste.

  Recipe quoted from Elena's Secretes of Mexican Cooking, Elena Zelayeta
  
  "This dessert is usually served during Lent.  The combination of

  Mexico and I know many Americans who rave over it.
  
  Boil water, sugar, stick cinnamon an dclove together until syrupy.
  Butter a casserole generously and put in a layer of bread or cake

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Chicken (boneless),
           -diced
      1 lb Kidney beans
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Chili powder
      1 md Onion, chopped
      3 md Tomatoes, diced
      1 lb Lettuce, chopped
           -(about half of
           -a large head)
    1/4 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -grated
      1 c  Thousand island
           -dressing
    1/4 c  Picante sauce
           -(or more or less,
           -to taste)
      1 lg Avocado, sliced
    3/4 lb Corn tortilla chips
 
  Bone and dice the chicken.  Heat a small amount of vegetable oil in a
  large frying pan until it starts to smoke. Add the chicken cubes and
  fry over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until they are
  browned (2 or 3 minutes).  To the chicken, add the drained kidney
  beans, salt and chili powder.  Reduce heat and simmer
       10    minutes.
  
  Chop the tomatoes, onion and lettuce.  Grate the cheese. Toss them
  together in a salad bowl with the salad dressing and picante sauce.
  Slice the avocado and add to the salad. Break the tortilla chips into
  flakes and add to the salad.
  
  Mix the cooked chicken and beans into the cold salad. Decorate with
  extra chips and slices of avocado and tomato. Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple main-dish salad with Mexican seasonings -- I got this
  recipe from an old roommate, Ann-Marie Tarter. My husband revised it
  to use chicken instead of the hamburger that her version called for.
  It's a very simple, tasty hot-weather main dish. It doesn't keep as
  leftovers: you have to eat all of it immediately or else throw it
  away. I like to serve it accompanied by Aztec soup. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  The chips get soggy within 5 to 10 minutes after the meat has been
  added to the salad, so don't do that step until you are ready to eat.
  
  *  This recipe works best with iceberg lettuce.  The more exotic
  varieties of lettuce wilt instantly when the hot chicken and beans
  are mixed in; iceberg lettuce keeps its crunch.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

   ====================================================== ==== GLOSSARY
  OF INGREDIENTS OF MEXICAN AND SOUTHWESTERN COOKING
  ======================================================= === ACHIOTE
  SEED: The dried reddish seeds of the annatto tree give food a bright
  orange-yellow tint when they are cooked first in hot fat; then, the
  seeds themselves are discarded.  Sometimes they are ground to a
  powder and stirred into such foods as butter for color. They impart a
  flavor that is gentle and hard to describe; like that of saffron, it
  has an earthy quality.
   ADOBO:  A piquant sauce of tomato, vinegar and spices.
   ANISE SEED:  This small, elongated seed tastes sharply of licorice.
   ATOLE BLUE CORNMEAL:  This is blue corn that has been dried,
  roasted, and ground specifically to be used in make ATOLE, a cornmeal
  gruel.
   Blue corn, unlike ordinary field corn, is always dried and ground
  before use.  Cornmeal, blue, yellow, or white, can be used as a
  thickener.
   AVOCADO:  This fruit is ripe when the flesh under the leathery skin
  yields to light pressure.  A hard avocado will ripen if left at room
  temperature for two or three days. The Haas or California type is
  smaller and darker green than the emerald type grown in Florida, and
  some say it is more flavorful as well. Keep avocado flesh from
  discoloring by brushing it with lemon juice as it is peeled.
   BEANS:  It takes time to prepare dried beans, but the result is a
  tender bean that is still firm.  Canned beans are sometimes mushy,
  but they are convenient to keep on hand and are packed in liquid that
  adds flavor to many recipes.  Dried beans keep almost indefinitely.
   Before cooking dried beans, rinse them well and pick them over for
  stones or inferior beans.
   TYPES OF BEANS:
      BLACK BEANS:  (frijoles negros, turtle beans) though small, have a
      hearty flavor.  South American cooking makes great use of them.
      With their dramatic dark purple-blue color, they lend themselves
      nicely to garnishes.
      BLACK-EYED PEAS:  (cowpeas) are the seeds of the cowpea, an annual
      vine.  They are tan with a blackish stain, hence "black-eyed".
      GARBANZO BEANS: (chickpeas) are Spanish in origin. These rounded
      beige beans have a nutty flavor.
      NORTHERN BEANS: are white, relatively large and mild.
      PINTO BEANS: (frijoles) are charmingly speckled with brown on a
      pale or pinkish background.
      RED BEANS: are favorites in the southern states. Pinto beans may
      be substituted.
   BUFFALO:  This commercially raised red meat is lower in cholesterol
  and fat than beef.  Unlike beef, it isn't marbled with fat.
   Accustomed as we are today to tender cuts of meat, buffalo is best
  enjoyed ground rather than steaks.
   CAPERS:  These are the pickled, green buds from the prickly caper
  bush. They are somewhat smaller than raisins and are bottled in brine.
   CAYENNE:  See Chile.
   CHAYOTE: (christophine, mirliton, vegetable pear): Related to gourds,
  chayote squash have none of their brilliant decoration.
   Light green skin encases firm flesh of an even paler green. Chayote
  may be baked, steamed, stuffed and sauteed. A 1 lb Chayote makes a
  nice serving for two or three people.
   CHEESE:  Traditional Mexican cheeses were mad with goat's or sheep's
  milk. The following cheeses are used in this style of cooking: TYPES
  OF CHEESE:
      CHEDDAR: is a mild firm cheese of English origin that becomes more
      sharp with age.  It melts beautifully.
      CHIHUAHUA: (Asadero Or Oaxaca) is white, creamy and tangy.
      Sometimes it is sold braided.  Mozzarella or Monterey Jack may be
      substituted.
      CO-JACK: is an American invention.  Block cheese marbled with
      Colby and Monterey Jack.
      COLBY: is a slightly sharp cheese with a flavor similar to that of
      Cheddar.  This American cheese has a rather soft open texture.
      MONTERY JACK:  is a mild cheese usually sold in blocks. It
      softens at room temperature.
      QUESO ANEJO: is an aged, hard grating cheese.  It ranges from pale
      cream to white in color and is quite salty. Romano or Parmesan
      may be substituted.
      QUESO FRESCO: (Ranchero seco) can be compared to a very salty
      farmer's cheese.  A reasonable substitute for this crumbly cheese
      is Feta Cheese.
      SIERRA:  is another rather dry sharp cheese that grates easily.
      Romano or Parmesan may be substituted.

   CHILI:  Chilies are native to the Americas.  They have been known in
  North America for some time but are said to have traveled north by a
  circuitous route; apparently they found their way from Mexico to the
  Western world with Christopher Columbus, then to the East and finally
  back to North America.  New strains of chilies are developed
  frequently, bred for hardiness, sweetness, hotness and so forth.  But
  chilies are full of surprises; two chilies picked from the same plant
  may vary widely in hotness.  To quench the fire of a too-spicy
  mouthful, do not reach for a water glass.  Water will only spread the
  capsaicin (the compound that our tongues register as "hot") around.
   Instead, take a large mouthful of something starchy; corn chips,
  beans, bread or rice.  Sometimes finding fresh chilies is difficult.
   This probably isn't a question of distribution, but of perishability.
   Canned and dried chilies are usually available.
   The Following is a short list of peppers and what they are.
   TYPES OF PEPPERS:
      ANAHEIM CHILIES: (California Green Chilies) are slim between five
      and eight inches long and of various light shades of green. these
      mildly hot chilies are sometimes twisted in appearance. They are
      occasionally stuffed, but their flesh is thin and more fragile
      than that of the poblano chilies. The Anaheims cultivated in New
      Mexico-- where the name is Chili Verde--are reputedly hotter. A
      ripe red Anaheim is sometimes known as a chili Colorado. Anaheim
      chilies are dried and tied in wreathes (ristras) and ground and
      blended in commercial chili powder mixtures.  They may be
      purchased in cans as "mild green chilies".  These chilies were
      named after the town that at the turn of the century, was the site
      of a chili cannery.
      ANCHO refers to a ripened, dried poblano chili.
      CASCABEL CHILIES:  True ones are scarcer than hens' teeth in most
      parts of the United States.  Sometimes dried Anaheim Chilies are
      labeled "cascabel," but they are very different from the authentic
      item.  Fresh cascabel chilies are hot and have a distinctive
      flavor. They are round and 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Dried, the
      cascabel chili has a nutlike flavor.
      CAYENNE CHILIES: are thin and tapered, three to seven inches long.
      Dark green (unripe) or bright red (ripe), the cayenne is
      incendiary and well known to Asian kitchens.  The red ones are
      dried and ground to make cayenne pepper ("ground red pepper").
      This product adds heat and just a little chili flavor.
      CHIPOTLE CHILIES: are smoked, dried Jalapenos with a very wrinkled
      appearance.  Fresh jalapenos are vibrant green but they turn brown
      when smoked. Chipotles can be purchased loose (dry) or canned in
      Adobo sauce.  The canned variety is especially convenient as it
      saves having to soak and soften them.
      GUAJILLO CHILIES: (Mirasol Chilies) have a vegetal flavor that
      shines even though the drying process.  Guajillos are orange-red,
      skinny and about two to three inches long.
      JALAPENO CHILIES: range from hot to very hot. They are dark
      green, fat and about two to three inches long with a
      characteristically rounded tip.  Watch out for the little ones,
      which are the hottest.  Jalapenos ripen to red. Use them fresh or
      pickled.
      PASILLA CHILIES: are hot and brown (almost black when dried, which
      is how they are commonly found.)  They have a dusky flavor.
      POBLANO: is the chili most frequently used for CHILIES RELLANOS.
      It is a suave dark green and ranges from mild to hot. Shaped like
      a long bell pepper, the poblano has a nice shape for stuffing.
      RED PEPPER FLAKES: are just that; flaked, dried ripe chilies. Most
      red pepper flake mixtures are quite hot.
      SERRANO CHILIES: are a sort of middling green, developing to
      brilliant red when ripe.  Extremely hot (as hot as any chili),
      this chili is usually shorter and thinner than the jalapeno.

 Categories: Mexican, Info/tips, Cheese
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Dictionary of MEXICAN Cookin
      1 x  (This is part 4 of 6)
 
   GROUND RED PEPPER:  From ground dried cayenne chilies, this is often
  called "cayenne pepper".  See Chili, Cayenne.
   GUAVA:  These yellow-green fruits with pale faintly pink flesh are
  about the size of a plum.  They are intensely fragrant when ripe.
   Guava paste is only one of the fruit pastes beloved of Hispanics,
  often served with cream cheese as dessert. The fruit is cooked with
  sugar until thick, then canned or shaped into blocks.
   HOMINY:  These corn kernels have been soaked and lightly cooked so
  that the outer coating can be removed.
   INSTANT CORN FLOUR TORTILLA MIX (MASA): This commercial product is
  the shortcut in making fresh corn tortillas. It is fresh corn MASA
  that has been dried and ground.
   JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE (Sunchoke)  This knobbed root keeps well in the
  refrigerator or other cold place. Jerusalem artichokes discolor after
  peeling.  Dip them in acidulated water as the flesh is exposed.
   Enjoy Jerusalem artichokes ray in salads, or broiled, sauteed,
  mashed or in a gratin.
   JICAMA:  The flesh of the jicama root is often compared to that of
  the water chestnut, both for flavor and crunch. Jicama is related to
  the sharp-tasting turnip but is so mild in flavor that, when eaten
  raw, it is usually sprinkled with lemon or lime juice and chili
  powder. After the brown fibrous skin has been pared away, jicama
  flesh does not discolor. Look for smallish jicama, which will be
  sweet and moist.
   JUNIPER BERRIES:  The fruit of an ever green, juniper berries give
  gin its distinctive flavor.  They are sometimes used to flavor game
  dishes. These blue-green berries are purchased dried.  Add them
  (sparingly) whole to saucy foods for subtle flavor or slightly
  crushed for more impact.
   LARD: This has been perhaps the most frequently used cooking fat
  south of the boarder since it was introduced by the Spaniards. For
  tender, flaky pastries, lard can't be beat.  It is little known that
  lard, for all its reputation, has approximately half the cholesterol
  of butter.
   MANGO:  The skin of this oval fruit is washed in gold, pink, red, and
  parrot green.  The flesh is deep yellow, juicy and richly perfumed.
   Mangoes have flat, oval pits.  To slice the fruit, free it from the
  pit in large pieces.
   MASA:  Literally "dough" in Spanish.  MASA is cornmeal dough made
  from dried corn kernels that have been softened in a lime (calcium
  hydroxide) solution, then ground. Fresh MASA is commercially
  available in Mexico, but it is tricky to work with and dries out
  quickly. MASA comes finely ground, for tortillas, and coarsely ground
  for tamales. It is easier to use instant corn flour tortilla mix when
  making tortillas.
   NOPALES:  These leaves of the prickly pear (nopal) cactus are firm
  crunch pads.  Let size be your guide in buying them; the smaller the
  pad, the more likely it is to be tender. Use tweezers to remove
  spines, a sharp paring knife or vegetable peeler to remove their
  bases. With a flavor similar to green beans, NOPALES are eaten both
  raw and cooked.
   NUTS:  In southwest cooking, nuts are sometimes ground and stirred
  into sauces as a thickening agent. In addition to giving the sauce
  more body, raw nuts add, of course, their own particular flavor.
   Toasted nuts are more often used as a garnish or in baking.
      TOASTING NUTS:  Toasting enhances the flavor of the nut. To
      toast nuts, spread them in a single layer in an ungreased pan;
      bake at 350 degrees F, stirring and checking for doneness
      frequently.  Nuts are toasted when they are lightly browned. Let
      almonds, pecans and walnuts bake for 7 to 12 minutes. Pine nuts
      toast more rapidly, in 5 to 7 minutes.
      TO GRIND NUTS:  To grind nuts, place 1/3 to 1/2 cup at a time in
      the workbowl of a food processor or blender. Process them in
      short pulses just until ground (longer and you will have nut
      butter).
   PAPAYA:  A nearly oval fruit with creamy golden yellow skin, orange
  yellow flesh and scores of shiny black seeds conveniently packed in
  its center. When slightly underripe, the flesh is firm (perfect for
  making into relishes); When ripe, it is so juicy as to be almost
  melting.
   PECAN:  This oil-rich nut is an American native.  See Nuts for
  toasting and grinding.
   PEPITA:  See Pumpkin Seed PEPPER: There is PIPER NIGRUM, Peppercorn,
  and the CAPSICUM FRUTECENS and CASPSICUM ANNUUM, the family of
  vegetables know variously as peppers and chilies. Peppercorns came to
  the Western world originally from Madagascar. The success of medieval
  spice traders made black pepper more widely available and only a
  little less precious than it had previously been.
   Representing the FRUTESCENS contingent, bell peppers are related to
  chilies but lack the capsaicin (the compound that makes them hot),
  Bell peppers are therefore known as "sweet". Until recently, bell
  peppers of any color than green were an oddity at many markets;
  today, there is a profusion of yellow, red and purple ones. Red and
  yellow are acknowledged to be the sweetest. Roast bell peppers as for
  chilies.

   PHEASANT:  This game bird fares equally well when cooked with a
  bravely seasoned sauce or a mild creamy one. Serve it with a grain
  side dish; see Game.
   PILONCILLO:  This unrefined sugar is purchased in hard cones. Like
  other "raw" sugars, piloncillo is beige to brown; the deeper the
  color, the more pronounced the molasses flavor.
   PINE NUTS (PINIONS, PIGNOLIS):  Pine nuts are the seeds of the Pinion
  pine.  They are delicious raw or toasted. Store them tightly covered
  and either refrigerated or frozen, depending on how quickly they are
  to be used.  See NUTS for toasting and grinding.
   PLANTAIN:  This relative of the banana boasts a thick skin and large
  size. The fruit itself tends to be a deeper yellow than that of the
  banana. Cooked unripe plantain is eaten as one would a potato.
   Plantains are sweetest when ripe, which isn't until their skins are
  an alarming through black.  Like bananas, plantains will ripen after
  they have been harvested.
   POSOLE:  Sometimes hominy is called "posole," but the word
  authentically refers to a dish made with hominy as an ingredient. See
  Hominy PRICKLY PEAR:  This is the diminutive (egg size) fruit of the
  cactus of the same name.  It is nearly impossible to avoid the
  prickles when peeling to reveal the garnet-colored flesh.  Prickly
  pears are sometimes sold with the prickles removed.
   PUMPKIN SEED:  With the shells or husks removed, pumpkin seeds are
  known as PEPITAS.  Store them in a cool, dry place. To toast pumpkin
  seeds, spread them in a single layer in an ungreased pan. Bake at 350
  degrees F. for 13 to 15 minutes, stirring and checking for doneness
  frequently.
   QUAIL:  These little birds weigh in at about 1/4 pound. They have
  richly flavored meat, what there is of it. Quail are most commonly
  available frozen.  See GAME.
   QUESO:  Spanish for "cheese." QUESO ANEJO: The name means "aged
  cheese" in Spanish. See CHEESE.
   QUESO FRESCO:  The name means "fresh cheese" in Spanish. See CHEESE.
   RABBIT:  Rabbits are raised commercially.  As with many uncommon
  meats, it is said of rabbit, that it "tastes like chicken." It
  doesn't; it tastes like rabbit. Large rabbits aren't as tender as the
  little ones; it is well to marinate or stew older ones, or make
  rabbit sausage. See GAME.
   RED PEPPER:  See Ground Red Pepper.
   RED PEPPER SAUCE:  This commercially bottled condiment is made from
  vinegar, spices and hot chilies. It adds heat but little in the way of
  flavor.
   RICE:  Mexican cooking calls for long grain or medium-grain white
  rice. The occasional southwestern dish uses wild rice, which really
  isn't rice. It is the fruit of an aquatic grass once harvested only
  by Native Americans who lived by the Great Lakes.
   SQUASH BLOSSOMS:  Contrary to poplar belief, the blossoms used in
  southwest cooking are those of winter squashes such as pumpkin, not
  zucchini.  They are a perishable item and are best used the day they
  are bought.
   TAMARIND:  This is an intensely pungent, tart pod about four inches
  long. Tamarind is usually bought packaged in a tightly compressed,
  sticky plastic-wrapped lump.  The flesh is riddled with fibers and
  seeds--not what you want in your food--and must be soaked before
  using. Separate the tamarind pods, pulling away and discarding as
  much of the pod as you reasonably can.  Cover with water and let the
  pulp soak for at least an hour (overnight, if time permits). Then
  squeeze the pulp well to extract the juice or rub as much pulp as you
  can through a fine mesh sieve.
   TEQUILA:  A pale, sharp-tasting liquor distilled from the agave
  plant, which thrives in an arid, hot climate. The stem of the agave,
  known also as the "century plant," is used in making both PULQUE and
  tequila.

   TOMATILLO:  These fat little vegetables are the size of robust cherry
  tomatoes.  They grow in papery husks reminiscent of Japanese lanterns
  and taste best when they are a brilliant green in color. By the time
  they begin to turn yellow, they have lost some of their acid
  freshness. This happens when they are lightly cooked too, but then,
  although they relinquish their vibrant color, the develop a gentler
  flavor and become more luscious. Uncooked, chopped tomatillos are the
  basis for chunky green salsas. Select tomatillos with their husks
  still drawn tightly around them. Husk and rinse off the sticky
  residue before using them.
   TOMATO:  Roasting tomatoes gives them a faintly mysterious flavor. It
  works best with truly ripe red tomatoes.
      TO ROAST TOMATOES:  To roast and peel tomatoes, set the oven
      control to broil.  Arrange cored tomatoes with their top surfaces
      about 5 inches from the heat.  Broil, turning occasionally, until
      the skin is blistered and evenly browned, about 5 to 8 minutes.
      The skins will be easy to remove.  If the tomatoes are roasted on
      aluminum foil, the cleanup will be easy and you'll be able to save
      any juice they give off as they roast.
   TORTILLA:  Tortillas are round, flat unleavened breads made from
  ground wheat or corn.  They are the basis of Mexican cookery.
   Tortillas are rolled, folded, used as dippers, fried crisp and
  munched fresh.  Corn tortillas are cut into wedges and fried for
  chips. For the best chips, fry tortillas that are at least one day
  old. Flour tortillas, softer than those made from corn, are more
  popular in northern Mexico where corn does not flourish; wheat was
  brought there by the Spanish. Commercially made tortillas of both
  kinds are best stored in the freezer until needed.
   To soften tortillas, warm them on a hot ungreased skillet or griddle
  for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. They can be warmed in a 250 degree
  oven for 15 minutes. Or, wrap several in dampened microwaveable paper
  toweling or microwave plastic wrap and microwave on high (100% Power)
  for 15 to 20 seconds.
   TRIPE:  Usually what is meant by tripe is the line of pig and sheep
  stomachs.  Tripe is the identifying ingredient of traditional MEMUDO,
  a hearty soup. Tripe needs to be thoroughly rinsed often, in three or
  four changes of cold water, before it can be used.
   VENISON:  Venison is deer meat.  Because it is lean, venison needs
  moist heat to keep it tender.  See GAME.
   WALNUTS:  The flavor of this nut is delicious with corn. See NUTS for
  toasting and grinding.

      Title: MEXICAN DINNER
 Categories: Main dish, Mexican
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Recipe refried beans
      1    Recipe herbed rice
      1    Recipe enchilada filling
      1    Recipe uncooked salsa
      2 c  Grated cheese
      4    Corn tortillas
 
  First make the refried beans, herbed rice, and salsa. Prepare the
  enchilada filling.  In a medium frying pan, melt butter, soft-fry
  each corn tortilla in the butter by cooking it on one side until it
  starts to get limp, then turn it over and fry another second or two.
  Roll 1/2 c filling inside each tortilla.  Store filled tortillas on a
  plate, covered with a plastic bag, in the refrigerator until you are
  ready to serve dinner. When ready to serve, place 1 rolled enchilada
  on each plate, cover with about 1/2 c salsa, being careful to cover
  the ends of the enchilada so they don't dry out during baking.
  Arrange 1/2 c herbed rice and 1/2 c refried beans next to the
  enchilada. Sprinkle it with 1/2 c grated cheese. Bake in preheated
  350 degree oven for 15-20 min, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
  Serve immediately.  A dollop of sour cream and a few black olives are
  excellent additions to each plate. ~--

  peppers in individual bowls.  Mix Herbed Vinaigrette and chili powder.

  national colors of Mexico are green, white and red. The green
  symbolizes the lofty hopes of the new Republic; the white stands for
  the purity of its endeavors and the red for the valor displayed in
  pursuit of these noble goals. The Mexican Flag Salad represents these
  colors with green, white and red vegetables and the chopped ripe
  olives simulate the black eagle on the flag.

      Title: MEXICAN FLAN (CUSTARD)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8    Eggs
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
     26 oz Evaporated milk, undiluted
      2 ts Vanilla
 
  Traditionally this is made with a layer of caramelized sugar on the
  bottom of the pan: heat white sugar in a heavy pan until it melts and
  turns light brown, then quickly and carefully pour it into the baking
  pan and tilt the pan so it runs all over the bottom.
  
  Beat eggs, mix in sugar and salt, then milk and vanilla. Pour into a
  glass baking dish and set the dish in a pan of hot water in the oven
  at 350 degrees. Bake uncovered for 1 hour or until solid. I think it
  comes out better if you don't stir it while it's cooking.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2    Box lasagna noodles
      1 cn (1 lb) fatfree vegetarian
           Refried beans
      1 c  Chunky salsa (any degree of
           Eat you prefer)
      1 c  Fatfree or 1% fat cottage

      1 c  Shredded fatfree (or low fat
           If desired) cheddar cheese
 
  Cook noodles according to package directions.  Rinse and drain.
  
  In a small saucepan, mix beans and salsa and heat over a medium flame
  until runny (helps to spread the mixture). Place a small amount of
  the bean mixture in the bottom of a square 8 or 9 inch baking dish.
  Layer four or five lasagna noodles over the dish (cut off extra
  length of noodle and save for the next noodle layer). Spread 1/2 of
  the bean/salsa mix on top of noodles then top with 1/2 the cottage
  cheese and some of the cheddar. Top with more noodles then the
  remaining bean/salsa mix and cottage cheese. top with more cheddar
  and remaining noodles. Top with a little more cheddar. Bake in
  microwave at medium-high for 10 minutes (uncovered) or in oven for 30
  minutes at 350 degrees (or until hot and bubbly).
  
  This was really good and alot easier than it sounds. Giving a recipe

      Title: MEXICAN MINT MARIGOLD (TAGETES LUCIDA)
 Categories: Seasonings, Info
      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
  "Mexican mint marigold has a lot to offer.  It thrives in the hot,
  humid South, where many herbs languish; its small, bright flowers
  blossom in fall when other herbs have played out for the season; its
  licorice-anise flavor is a successful stand-in for French tarragon;
  and it looks good in the garden.
  
  "This paragon, native to the mountains of Mexico and Guatemala, is a
  neat, upright bush some 3 feet tall with narrow, sharply toothed dark
  green leaves.  Its scent recalls that of tarragon more than it does
  the pungent aroma of its familiar bedding-plant cousins, so-called
  French and African marigolds.  In fall, if the growing season is long
  enough, the tips of the stems bear clusters of 3/8-inch golden yellow
  flowers.
  
  "Cloud plant, as this herb is known in Mexico, was first documented
  there in the sixteenth century by Spanish explorers. According to
  legend, the ancient Aztec chieftains used a powder made from the
  aromatic leaves of mint marigold to calm the hapless victims of
  sacrificial rituals. The leaves have also been used medicinally in
  folk remedies for malaria, colic, and colds; a poultice of the leaves
  is a traditional treatment for rattlesnake bite."
  
  "Beside cloud plant, Mexican mint marigold has many other aliases,
  most alluding to its fragrance: sweet mace, Mexican or winter
  tarragon, sweet or mint-scented marigold, root beer plant, Mexican
  marigold mint, and yerba anis.  Its Latin generic name, Tagetes,
  probably comes from Tages, an Etruscan deity said to be the grandson
  of Jupiter. A boy with the wisdom of an old man who sprang from the
  ground (or perhaps was plowed up), he taught the Etruscans the art of
  soothsaying. The specific name, lucida, means 'bright' or 'shining',
  probably referring to the bright yellow-gold flowers.
  
  "T. lucida is closely related to both ordinary garden marigolds and
  the citrus-scented signet marigolds (T. tenuifolia). The latter are
  prized by herb gardeners as potpourri material as well as for their
  ornamental value. They are all native to the New World, unlike pot
  marigold (Calendula officinalis), the herb referred to as 'marigold'
  by Gerard, Culpeper, and other great herbalists.
  
                          - In the Kitchen -
  
  "Chop the fresh leaves and use them to season chicken and tossed green
  salads, or brew them into a sweet, anise-flavored tea. The dried
  leaves retain their fragrance well if kept in a sealed glass
  container and protected from extreme heat and bright light..."
  
  "In the humid South, where French tarragon is difficult to grow, mint
  marigold is a fine culinary substitute. The flavor is almost
  indistinguishable from that of tarragon, but because mint marigold
  breaks down more quickly when heated, it's best if added at the end
  of cooking. In salads, vinegars, oils, or quick-cooking recipes,
  substitute it for tarragon in equal proportions.
  
                             - Crafts -
  
  "Mint marigold's dried leaves add fragrance to potpourris and sachets.
  Harvest the long stems just before frost when they are tipped with
  yellow-gold flowers. While they're still green and pliable, weave them
  together in groups of six or nine as you would braid hair, then tie
  the two ends of each group together to form a circle. Dried leaves
  can be removed as needed for cooking.  If the wreaths are made small
  and interwoven with other herbs, they can be tossed whole into a soup
  or stew as a bouquet garni.
  
  "The flowers add long-lasting color to dried arrangements and
  bouquets. They are attractive combined with sweet Annie, broom, and
  goldenrod in harvest centerpieces, or bundle the stems with
  natural-colored raffia for fragrant hang-ups that add a warm ambiance
  to any room. For a change of pace and scale, clip the stems short and
  make miniature bouquets in tiny vases.  As with other marigolds,
  Mexican mint marigold looks good and lasts well in fresh flower
  arrangements as well."

      Title: MEXICAN MOCHA PIE
 Categories: Mexican, Pies, Desserts, Kooknet, Cyberealm
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 pk Unflavored gelatin
    1/3 c  Coffee flavored liqueur
    1/2 c  Cold water
      4    Eggs
      3 oz Semisweet chocolate
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Butter or margarine
    1/4 c  Almonds; slivered
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1    9-in pie shell; baked
 
  Sprinkle gelatin over 1/2 cup cold water in a measuring cup; let
  soften about 5 min. Seperate eggs, placing 2 egg whites in small bowl
  of an electric mixer and 4 egg yolks in top of a double
  boiler.(refrigerate remaining whites for use in another recipe) Let
  egg whites warm to room temerature.
    Beat yolks slightly with a wooden spoon; stir in gelatin mixture,
  semisweet chocolate and 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Cook over hot, not
  boiling water, stiring until melted, about 10 min. Remove mixture from
  heat, stir in coffee flavored liqueur.
    Pour chocolate mixture into a medium-sized bowl; place in a large
  bowl of ice water. Stir mixture occasionally until it cools and is
  the consistency of unbeaten egg whites, about 15 minutes. Toast
  almonds: In a small skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add
  almonds; cook, stirring, just until golden brown. Cool.
    In chilled bowl of an electric mixer, whip heavy cream until stiff;
  refrigerate. Meanwhile, with electric mixer (use clean beaters), beat
  egg whites just until soft peaks form when beaters are slowly raised.
  Gradually beat in remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, beating until stiff
  peaks form when beaters are raised.
    With wire whisk or rubber spatula, using an under-and-over motion,
  fold beaten egg whites and 1 1/2 cups of the whipped cream into the
  chocolet mixture. Cover and refrigerate remaining whipped cream. Turn
  filling into pie shell, spreading filling evenly. Refridgerate until
  filling is firm, about 3 hours.
    Chop the toasted almonds. Spoon the remaining whipped cream into a
  pastry bag fitted with a #6 tip; pipe whipped cream along inside edge
  of the pie crust. With a spoon, sprinkle almonds around tne inside
  edge of the whipped cream. Refridgerate until ready to serve.
  Variation: add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to chocolate mixture. NOTE: We
  advise caution when preparing recipes that call for raw eggs to avoid
  exposure to salmonella.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Casera Sauce; *
      2    Eggs; Large
      2 tb Half & Half
    1/2 ts Oregano Leaves; Dried

  *    See Sowest 2 For the Recipe.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~------------- ~-- Prepare the Casera Sauce; set aside. Mix the eggs,
  half-and-half, oregano, salt and pepper with a fork just until the
  whites and yolks are blended. Heat the margarine in an 8-inch skillet
  or omelet pan over medium-high heat.  As the margarine melts, tilt
  the skillet to coat the bottom completely. When the margarine just
  begins to brown, the skillet is hot enough to use.  Quickly pour the
  egg mixture into the skillet. Slide the skillet back and forth
  rapidly over the heat, and at the same time, stir quickly with a fork
  to spread the eggs continuously over the bottom of the skillet as
  they thicken. Let stand over the heat a few seconds to lightly brown
  the bottom of the omelet. (DO NOT overcook; the omelet will continue
  to cook after it is folded.  Tilt the skillet; fun the fork under the
  edge of the omelet to loosen from the bottom of the skillet. Sprinkle
  with the cheese and chiles.  Fold the portion of the omelet nearest
  you to the center. (allow for a portion of the omelet to slid up the
  side of the skillet.)  Turn omelet out on a warm plate, flipping the
  fold portion of the omelet over so the far side is on the bottom.
  Tuck the sides of the omelet under if necessary.  Top with the Casera
  Sauce and sour cream; sprinkle with fresh, chopped cilantro, if

  COOK'S NOTES:
  
  Timing and Advance Preparation The rice pudding can be ready in an
  hour, much of which won't involve your direct participation. It may
  be prepared through Step 2 a day or two in advance, then buttered and
  broiled shortly before serving.
  
  Historical Notes:
  
  Arroz con leche
  
  This dessert is softer and more connamony than our baked rice
  pudding. The flavors are simple and close to home, but it's easy to
  develop a thoroughgoing love for it, spoonful after spoonful. mexican
  people everywhere serve it as regularly as they do flan; it's creamy
  and, in its own way, light and soothing.
  
  This is an especially pretty and tasty recipe, based on one from
  Zelayaran's Las 500 (quinentos) mejores recetas de la cocina
  mexicana. (The 500 best recipes of the Mexican Kitchen). Pronounced:
  Lahs keen-yen-toes may-hor-ays ree-setahs day lah ko-cheenah
  may-hi-kaanah. It would be welcome after a hearty soup like Menudo
  (may-noo-doe) or Shrimp-Ball soup; it travels well to potlucks.
  Leftovers, thinned with milk and warmed, are very good for breakfast.
  
  Rice pudding brings to my mind the volatile, chancy crowd of Mexico
  City's Garibaldi Square, where this dessert, only one of the
  attractions, sits in huge, milky masses stuck with a raisin or two
  for decoration. Or sometimes I am reminded of the well-used walkways
  around the Oaxacan (wah-hock-can) market, where ladies sell it in
  paper cups at sundown. Or I picture any of a dozen other typical
  scenes: from rude, makeshift street stands to well-appointed
  traditional restaurants-where arroz con leche (air-rose cone
  letch-ay) (roll those double R's baby) is the thing you have.

       12 oz Pepsi or Coke
      1/2 c  Orange juice
  
  *This is a best guess - she wasn't measuring it. Heat a large skillet
  over medium-high heat (NO FAT/OIL). When the pan is hot, add pork and
  brown well on all sides (the meat is fatty & shouldn't need oil).
  When meat is just about done, add the onion and cook till
  transparent. Add remaining ingredients & bring to simmer. Cover &
  cook 5 minutes. If there is still any liquid in the pan, uncover &
  continue to cook until it's evaporated. Remove the pork to a plate to
  cool. When cool enough to handle, shred the pork with your hands
  removing as much of the fatty pieces as possible. Can be served alone
  or in soft taco shells.

      Title: MEXICAN STUFFED PEPPERS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lg Red or green sweet peppers
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      2    Celery stalks; diced
      1 ts Cumin
      1 ts Chili powder
      1 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Oregano
      2 c  Brown rice; cooked
  1 1/2 c  Red kidney beans; cooked,
           -drained
           Cayenne to taste
  1 1/2 c  Tomatoes, canned; with their
           -juice
      1 cn Tomato paste (6 oz)
 
   Wash the peppers and cut them in half lengthwise.
   Remove the seeds.
  
   Place the peppers, cut side facing down, on a rack above boiling
  water. Cover the pot and steam for about 10 minutes, or until the
  peppers are just beginning to get soft. To ensure even doneness, do
  not stack the peppers on top of each other; keep them in a single
  layer. If you have a wok with a steaming rack, all the peppers can be
  steamed at the same time. If not, do them in two batches.
  
   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Ad the onions, celery, cumin,
  chili powder, basil and oregano. Saute until the onions are almost
  tender.
  
   Add the cooked rice and beans. Mix well; then add the shoyu or
  tamari and the cayenne to taste. Mix again.
  
   Lightly oil a shallow 7 - x - 11" baking dish. Fill each pepper with
  the bean and rice mixture and place the peppers side by side in the
  baking dish.
  
   Mix together the canned tomatoes and the tomato paste.
   If the tomatoes ar whole, chop them or break themup with a fork.
  
   pour the tomato mixture over the stuffed peppers.
   Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake at
      350    deg for 30 minutes.
  
   Serve with a big green saslad and slices of ripe avocado.
  
   Variation:
  
   Use 2 cups of tomato sauce instead of the canned tomatoes mixed with
  tomato paste.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Boneless pork butt or
           -shoulder
      1    Clove Garlic
      2 tb Chile powder
      1 tb Paprika
      2 ts Mexican oregano; well
           -crumbled
      1 ts Coarse salt (i use margarita
           -salt)
    3/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Ground cayenne chile
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
           Enough pork fat if necessary
           -to make a 2-to-1 meat to
           -fat ratio
 
  Cut the meat (and fat, if necessary) into chunks. Spread out on a pie
  pan or cookie sheet and place in the freezer to chill (not long
  enough to freeze, just long enough to become firm). Grind the meat
  and fat together twice, using a coarse blade. Remove the skin from
  the garlic clove, finely dice it, spinkle it with coarse salt, and
  crush it with the back of a dinner fork. Add garlic and spices to the
  wine vinegar and knead it well into the meat/fat mixture. Cover and
  refrigerate at least a couple of hours or overnight. The sausage can
  be stuffed into prepared casings or formed into patties or
  appropriate size bulk portions and refrigerated for up to 3 days
  before use after which any remaining should be frozen.
  
  Pork sausage (and chorizo in particular) don't stand up too well to
  lengthy freezing and should be used up within 2 or 3 months.
  
  BTW - Even though fennel seed is more typical in Italian sausage
  (usually whole), I add some CRUSHED fennel seed to my chorizo...

      Title: MEXICAN TOMATO SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Canning
      Yield: 7 Quarts
 
  2 1/2 lb -to...
      3 lb Chile peppers
     18 lb Tomatoes
      3 c  Chopped onions
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Oregano
    1/2 c  Vinegar
 
  Yield: About 7 quarts
  
  Procedure: Caution: Wear rubber gloves while handling chilies or wash
  hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching your face. Wash
  and dry chilies. Slit each pepper on its side to allow steam to
  escape. Peel peppers using one of the following methods:
  
  Oven or broiler method: Place chilies in oven (400 degree F) or
  broiler for 6-8 minutes until skins blister.
  
  Range-top method: Cover hot burner, either gas or electric, with
  heavy wire mesh. Place chilies on burner for several minutes until
  skins blister. Allow peppers to cool. Place in a pan and cover with a
  damp cloth. This will make peeling the peppers easier. After several
  minutes, peel each pepper. Cool and slip off skins. Discard seeds and
  chop peppers. Wash tomatoes and dip in boiling water for 30 to 60
  seconds or until skins split. Dip in cold water, slip off skins, and
  remove cores. Coarsely chop tomatoes and combine chopped peppers and
  remaining ingredients in large saucepan. Bring to a boil. Cover.
  Simmer 10 minutes. Fill jars, leaving 1-inch headspace. Adjust lids
  and process according to the recommendations in Table 1 or Table 2
  depending on the method of canning used.

      Title: MEXICAN TORTILLAS
 Categories: Breads, Mexican, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    225 g  Polenta (Maize Meal)
      1 ts Salt
    225 g  Plain white flour
     25 g  Lard or margarine
    300 ml Warm water
 
  Mix the maize meal, salt and white flour in a large bowl, add the
  lard or margarine and rub in until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
  Add the water and mix to a dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly
  floured surface and knead for a short time until smooth. Shape the
  dough into 4 equal balls, roughly the size of a tennis ball, and let
  them rest for about an hour covered with a damp tea towel. Roll each
  ball out thinly on the floured surface to a circle about 25cm (10
  inch) in diameter.
  
  Heat an ungreased griddle or large frying pan and fry the maize meal
  pancakes over a fairly high heat, turning them over so they are
  lightly brown on each side.
  
  Variations.
  
  The tortilla is a multi-purpose bread and can be served as it is, a
  thin, flat cornbread to accompany food. It can also be used as a
  platter or scoop for thick meat or bean mixtures. It can be fried on
  one side only and rolled round a chilli-and-bean stuffing to become a
  Taco, or stuffed, sometimes fried and coated in sauce when it is
  known as an Enchillada. Finally, it can be sprinkled with sweet
  mixtures and served as a pudding.

      Title: MICE
 Categories: Desserts, Australian
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
           Angelica (Cut two pieces
           -of crystalized (candied)
           -angelica, each about
           -1/8 inch by 2 inches)
      2    Almonds (blanched)
      2    Pear halves, preferably
           -canned (for
           -authenticity), but
           -cooked, fresh pear
           -would do
 
  Carefully halve the almonds along the natural split in the nut. (This
  is easiest after they are still wet from blanching.) Place the pear
  halves, round side up, in the serving dish.
  
  At the narrow end of each half, add two almond halves to make mouse
  ears. At the other end, insert the angelica to make a tail.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick pear dessert -- In general, a typical Australian dish is a
  typical British dish, which is to say a typical European or American
  dish with most of the subtleties of flavour (and difficulty in
  making) removed. The following dessert is a genuine Old Family
  Favorite in Australia.
  
  *  Candied angelica is almost impossible to find in North America.
  Anything else with the appropriate properties of sweetness and shape
  may be substituted, e.g. a piece of chocolate or candy cut to size,
  such as an Ovation mint divided longitudinally.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  2 minutes.
  : Precision:  don't measure, count.

      1    Stick butter, chilled
      6    Boneless chicken breast
           -halves
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Green onion, minced fine
      1 c  Flour for dredging
           Salt and pepper to taste
      2    Eggs, beaten
      1 c  Breadcrumbs for dredging
 
  Cut butter into 6 portions. Beat chicken pieces between wax paper
  until they are thin cutlets. Do not make any holes.
  
  Put one portion of butter in the middle of each cutlet. Sprinkle each
  with green onion and salt and pepper. Roll each chicken piece into an
  envelope shape, tucking in the sides.
  
  Put a bunch of flour in a bowl; add salt and pepper to taste. Beat
  two eggs in another bowl. Put about a cup of soft white breadcrumbs
  (stale bread will also do) in a third bowl.
  
  Take each chicken roll and dredge it in flour. Then dip it into the
  egg and then roll it in breadcrumbs. You may repeat the egg-crumb
  breading once if you like a thick crust. Put the finished rolls in
  the fridge for at least an hour to firm up the breading.
  
  Deep fry at 360 until brown on all sides. Serve with rice.

 Categories: Loo, Shellfish, Stews, Soups
      Yield: 6 To 8
 
     11 oz Can lobster meat
      1 qt Milk
      3 c  Cream
      4 tb Butter
           Salt, pepper,
           Sherry to taste
      1 tb Beurre manie (equal flour
           -and butter creamed
           -together, optional)
 
  For 1 can of lobster meat, allow 3 times that amount of milk, 2 times
  that amount of cream, and 1 teaspoon of butter per ounce of lobster.
  Also salt, pepper, sherry to taste. Also, if you like a thick soup,
  you can make a beurre manie: mash together 1 1/2 t each flour and
  butter until it's a smooth paste.
  
  Heat milk and cream together to the boiling point. In a soup kettle,
  saute the lobster in half the butter for a very brief time. Then add
  the simmering liquid. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as
  necessary, and a splash of sherry or brandy if you wish. Thicken as
  desired by raising the heat to the boil and stirring in the beurre
  manie, then lowering the heat to low and cooking until thick: I would
  not do this, because I like thin stew. But I might be inclined to
  reverse the ratio of cream to milk, or just use cream for the whole
  thing. Pour into warmed soup plates or bowls and float a pat of
  butter on each serving.

      1 lg Onion; finely minced
      1 md Carrot; finely minced
      1    Celery stalk; finely sliced
      1 tb Minced garlic
      1 tb Tomato paste
      6 lb Baby back ribs

      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      4 c  All-purpose stock
           -OR low-sodium chicken broth
      3    Bay leaves
      1    Sprig fresh thyme; -=OR=-
    1/2 ts -Dried thyme

MMMMM-----------------------BARBECUE RIBS----------------------------
      6 lb Braised baby back ribs
           Braising liquid from ribs
      1 tb Brown sugar
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
      2 tb Catsup
      1 tb Dry mustard
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 ts Chili powder
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  BRAISING SAUCE: Preheat oven to 350F. Mix onions, carrots, celery,
  garlic and tomato paste together and then place in a roasting pan
  large enough to comfortably hold the ribs in a single layer. Lay the
  ribs on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add stock, bay leaves
  and thyme. Cover and place in the oven for 1 hour. Remove from oven,
  remove the ribs and set aside to cool. Strain the braising liquid and
  discard the vegetables. TO FREEZE RIBS: Pour the liquid into a small
  freezer container and place in refrigerator to cool for 1 hour. When
  cool, remove and discard any fat that has congealed on the surface of
  the liquid. Cover tightly and place in freezer for up to 3 months.
  Wrap the meat in plastic wrap and then place in airtight plastic
  freezer bags or containers. You may freeze meat for up to 3 months,
  also. BARBECUE RIBS: TO BARBECUE THE RIBS: Preheat oven to 375F or
  light a charcoal grill. Defrost the braising liquid. Defrost the ribs
  or not; it's not important. Combine the sugar and vinegar in a
  1-quart pot and place over medium heat on top of the stove. Cook
  until the vinegar reduces and forms a syrup with the sugar, about 8
  minutes. Watch carefully as the syrup will suddenly darken in color.
  Immediately add the rib braising liquid, then the catsup, mustard,
  Worcestershire, cloves, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Cook,
  reducing the liquid until it has a thick sauce-like consistency.
  Remove from the heat and set aside. TO COOK RIBS IN THE OVEN, place
  ribs in a roasting pan, cover, place in oven and turn temperature to
  350F. Cook for 30 minutes, basting with more barbecue sauce every 10
  minutes. TO COOK ON THE GRILL, wait until the coals become white hot
  and pile them on one side of the grill. Place the ribs on the grill
  so they are not directly over the coals and cover the grill so that
  smoke collects inside. If your grill does not have a cover, improvise
  one out of aluminum foil. Cook for 30 minutes, basting with more
  barbecue sauce every 10 minutes. When ribs are well heated, remove to
  a platter and serve. Offer any additional barbecue sauce on the side.

  Thought you might be interested in these two recipes for a birthday
  cake. Michael, one of my roommates, just had his big 5-0. He said he
  wanted a mocha cake so I hauled out a couple of fifty year old
  cookbooks and put together this cake.  (Well, they were almost 50
  years old++one was put out in '46, the other in '50.) The cake++the
  first I'd ever made from scratch++turned out great.  It was nice and
  moist, if a tad on the heavy side.  The recipe is actually for
  cupcakes, but I just made one big layer. The frosting is outstanding,
  a definite keeper.
  
  Sift flour, cocoa, soda, baking powder and salt together 3 times.
  
  Cream shortening with sugar until fluffy.  Combine whole egg and egg
  yolks, beat well and add to creamed mixture. Combine coffee and
  buttermilk. Add sifted dry ingredients and liquids alternately in
  small amounts, beating well after each addition.  Pour into greased
  cupcake pans and bake in moderate oven (350F) for 20 minutes.
  
  Makes 18 medium or 12 large cupcakes.
  
  Frost with Fluffy White Icing.  Melt 1 ounce (square) chocolate with 1
  teaspoon butter and put a band around each cake with teaspoon or
  pastry brush.

  In a bowl, combine the meatball ingredients except the sherry. Break
  this mixture apart into small balls or bits according to preference.
  
  Heat a wok or skillet and saute the meat mixture until cooked to
  'rare'. Do not overcook or singe the meat. Remove the grease from the
  meat mixture by straining in a colander, then return to the hot wok
  or skillet and reheat. Add sherry and reduce.  Add this to the sauce
  in the pot. Simmer this mixture on the lowest possible heat for 6 or
  7 hours. Stir occasionally.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An exotically spiced spaghetti sauce with meat -- This is a very
  adaptable sauce which can be used in any recipe requiring tomato
  sauces. Best on spaghetti with garlic bread!
  
  *  I have found that Hunt's tomato products deliver the best flavor
  for this sauce; they are somewhat sweeter and less acidic than other
  brands. I always use Lea and Perrins Worcestershire sauce.
  
  *  This spaghetti sauce is the work of about 2 years experimentation.
  It has won some of the local cooking contests here in Maine.

  [Crush, chop, and saute the garlic. Sprinkle on ad lib between layers
  ~ the original recipe lists garlic as an ingredient but doesn't say
  what to do with it, so I guess this is more or less right.] Then, in
  layers, add sliced tomatoes, zucchini, onions (salt and pepper).
  Halfway up add thyme and laurel bouquet, then again eggplant etc.
  finishing with one layer of eggplant. Cover and cook very, very
  slowly for 3 hrs without stirring. Upon serving, stir, remove
  bouquet, and add one beaten raw egg [optional!].

 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Puff pastry  -- frozen
           Pastry cream
      2 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Sugar
        pn Salt
           Vanilla bean  -- split
      5    Egg yolk
    1/3 c  Cornstarch
           Glaze
 
  Roll out little circles of pastry leaving the two edges slightly
  thicker than the sides. Sprinkle with sugar. Cook the pastry cream
  ingredients until it boils and is thick. Cool. Place a generous
  tablespoon or so of cream on the pastry dough and two apricot halves
  so it looks like two egg yolks. Bake in 350F oven for 35 minutes.
  Brush pastry and apricots with a nice sweet apricot glaze. The baking
  takes the sweetness out of the fresh apricots so you need this final
  step.

      Title: MICHEL STROOT'S LITTLE ROUND POUND CAKES
 Categories: Dessert, Cake, Sax
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour, lightly
           Spooned into measuring cups
      1 c  Unsalted butter, softened
      1 c  Sugar
      1    Lemon- the grated zest only
      2 ts Pure vanilla extract
      5 lg Eggs, separated
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Quatre-Quarts or Four Quarters is the French name for this recipe. It
  refers to the proportion of ingredients (one-quarter each butter,
  sugar, eggs and flour). In France, the cake is served with afternoon
  tea but rarely as dessert.
  
  Source: CLASSIC HOME DESSERTS by Richard Sax Recipe by Michel Stroot,
  pioneering spa chef at "The Golden Door in California" who is from
  Belgium
  
  1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter 8 small ramekins,
  custard cups or tiny loaf pans; sprinkle with sugar, shaking out the
  excess sugar to leave a very fine coating. Place the pans on a baking
  sheet; set aside. Sift the flour onto a sheet of wax paper; set aside.
  
  2. Beat the butter with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until
  very creamy. Add the sugar and beat until very light, about 6
  minutes. Beat in the lemon zest and vanilla; add the egg yolks and
  beat for about 2 minutes longer. Lower the speed to slow, add the
  flour and beat just until nearly blended, about 15 seconds, no
  longer. The mixture will be stiff and slightly hard to blend at this
  point; don't OVERMIX.
  
  3. In a bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt at high speed until
  nearly stiff, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir a large spoonful of the whites
  into the batter; fold in the remaining whites until blended. Again,
  you'll have to work and chop the somewhat stiff mixture slightly in
  order to blend in the whites, but don't overblend. Gently spoon the
  mixture into the prepared remekins or pans, filling each about 2/3
  full.
  
  4. Bake until the cakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in
  the centers emerges clean, usually about 45 minutes (the timing can
  vary with the molds being used).
  
  5. Transfer to a wire rack and cool briefly. Run the tip of a knife
  around the sides of the cakes to loosen them from the ramekins;
  unmold and cool completely on the rack. You can either wrap the cakes
  in plastic wrap, or return them to their ramekins and seal the tops
  with plastic wrap.

 Categories: Bar-b-q, Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      4    Chicken breasts
           -(leave bones and
           -skin intact)
      3    Lemons
      1 md Onion, chopped
     12 oz Beer
      4 oz Soy sauce
      1    Garlic clove,
           -mashed or chopped
 
  Squeeze the juice of the lemons over the chicken and let stand while
  preparing the rest of the marinade.
  
  In a large bowl, combine the beer, soy sauce, chopped onion and
  chopped garlic.  Drain the lemon juice from above into this mixture.
  
  Put the chicken in the marinade, cover and refrigerate for 3 hours
  minimum. It's better to marinate overnight. Make sure chicken is
  covered by marinade.
  
  Over an OPEN outdoor grill (gas or charcoal), cook the chicken for
  about 40 minutes turning every 10 minutes or so. Each time the
  chicken is turned, re- dip the pieces in the marinade.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Easy marinated chicken for outdoor BBQ -- This recipe was obtained
  from a friend of a friend several years ago. It has been a hit every
  time and is guaranteed to have your downwind neighbors salivating at
  your doorstep. Yield:  serves 2-4.
  
  *  More chicken may be added to this recipe; the only limiting factor

 Categories: Jelly/jam, Fruits, Microwave, Kooknet
      Yield: 2 Half pints
 
      2 pt Berries; Raspberries,
           -Blackberries or
           -Boysenberries
      3 c  Sugar
 
  Place berries in an 8 cup measuring bowl or larger microwave-safe
  bowl and crush lightly. Stir in the sugar and let stand 5 minutes.
  Cover the container with plastic wrap and turn back a corner of the
  plastic so steam can escape. Microwave on HIGH (100%) 4-5 minutes, or
  until the mixture has come to a boil. Continue to microwave on MEDIUM
  (50%) for 8 minutes.
  
  (Caution, this can boil over easily. If your microwave oven has no
  glass dish on the bottom, place the bowl on a plate to catch any
  juices.) Remove plastic wrap and cook on MEDIUM (50%) for 8 minutes
  more.
  
  To test the jam, dip a spoon in the mixture. Run your finger through
  the mixture on the back of the spoon. If it leaves a distinct trail
  without closing in on itself, the jam is done. To double check, spoon
  a bit on a small saucer and place it in the freezer for 1 minute. It
  should have a jam-like consistency. If the jam needs more cooking,
  microwave on MEDIUM (50%) for a few more minutes. Store in the
  refrigerator.

      Title: MICROWAVE CHICKEN
 Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  This isn't a recipe per se but rather a method of 'browning' a
  chicken in the microwave.  You can combine the process with other
  recipes and come up with a really delicious, visually appealing dish.
  This is from "Micro Wave Meats Step-Step." It's part of the Micro
  Wave Cooking School series put out by Litton. Barbara Methven wrote
  it.
  
  "When a whole chicken is microwaved uncovered, it is similar to
  conventionally roasted.  The skin does not crisp but it develops some
  browning.  For more even color, use a browning agent or a glaze. To
  prevent streaking, scrub off any oily film on the chicken skin with a
  vegetable brush and hot water before applying the browning mixture.
  
  "Wash and dry chicken well.  Mix equal parts bouquet sauce and melted
  butter; rub or brush it into skin. (If preferred, glaze chicken after
  half the cooking time.)
  
  "Place chicken breast side down in baking dish. Microwave at High for
  the first 3 minutes.  Reduce power to 50% (Medium). Microwave for
  remainder of first half of time.
  
  "Turn breast side up.  (Glaze, if desired.) Microwave for second half
  of time, or until legs move freely and inner thigh meat is done." The
  bouquet sauce she refers to is Kitchen Bouquet or any similar
  product. I've used thick soy with good results.  (Add a little sherry
  and ginger and you end up with Soy Sauce Chicken.) It's best to rub
  the sauce in with your fingers.  If you use a brush it will probably
  cover as uniformly. About 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine and an
  equal amount of soy or bouquet seem to be about right for a whole
  chicken.
  
  The result is really amazing.  The chicken comes out moist and
  tender, much like a Chinese steamed chicken only brown. It's good
  just that way with various Oriental dips++mustard, chopped up green
  onions, hoisin sauce, etc.++if you're into that.  I don't use my
  microwave much for primary cooking but this is one dish that I do use
  it for. In fact, I got so hungry looking at the pictures that I think
  I'll go nuke one now!

 Categories: Microwave, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Whole chicken
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
    1/3 c  Honey
    1/3 c  Dry sherry
      1 tb Cornstarch
           Microwave cooking bag
 
  1. Into the cooking bag, place soy sauce, honey and sherry. Add whole
  chicken to bag and tie securely. Place the bag into a 2-quart oblong
  glass baking dish. Refrigerate for 2 hours, turn the bag 2-3 times to
  allow marinade to reach all surfaces of the chicken. 2. When ready to
  microwave, cut a slit in the bag near the closure. If you are using a
  temperature probe, insert through the slit into the thickest part of
  the thigh. Avoid touching the bone. 3. Microwave at medium high until
  temperature reaches 190 degrees, or about 20 minutes. Temperature
  varies so check after about 17 minutes. Remove chicken from
  microwave. 4. Prepare the sauce. Into a 1-quart glass measuring cup
  stir together 2 tablespoons water and 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Cut
  off one corner of the cooking bag and drain the juices into the
  measuring cup with the cornstarch and water. Microwave on high power
  for 2 minutes, stirring after one minute. Sauce should be thick and
  clear. 5. Chicken should stand in bag for 10 minutes; remove bag
  carefully, and place chicken on serving platter. Pour sauce over
  chicken and serve immediately.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Corn on the cob
 
  The easiest corn on the cob--peel the shuck back and rinse the corn
  with water. Put the shuck back in place and microwave. The time
  depends on the amount of corn and the power of your microwave. I use
  5 minutes for one ear and add a minute for each other ear. Let the
  corn sit for a minute or so or you might scald yourself with steam
  when you break off the bottom of the shuck and remove shuck and silk
  in one operation. I can't wait for summer and fresh corn.

      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Chopped nuts
 
  1.  Lightly grease an 8-inch square dish.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Place confectioners' sugar and cocoa in a medium-sized,
  heat-resistant, non-metallic mixing bowl. Stir to combine.
  
  3.  Add milk and butter to sugar-cocoa mixture.  DO NOT STIR (I was
  told to make a little well in the sugar stuff and then putting the
  butter and milk in the well, and I'm surprised to find it doesn't say
  that in the recipe...)
  
  4.  Heat, uncovered, on FULL POWER 2 minutes.
  
  5.  After cooking, stir just to combine ingredients.
  
  6.  Add vanilla and nuts.  Stir until blended.
  
  7.  Pour into prepared dish and refrigerate for 1 hour before cutting
  and serving.
  
  Valerie's Note:  Serve fudge squares with a big bowl of hot buttered
  popcorn, turn on a good movie and nestle in with that special
  someone....

    1/3 ea Brown rice
    1/3 ea Barley
    1/3 ea Millet
 
  I was bored with rice, so I mixed 1/3 brown rice, 1/3 barley, and 1/3
  millet.  Rinsed well, then put it in the microwave for ten minutes on
  high, and let it stand for a few hours. (I just put it in a big
  plastic bowl, and I didn't measure the water.)  It was yummy
  underneath chili, beans, and spaghetti sauce. (3 different meals.)

      Title: MICROWAVE GRAPE JELLY
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  (360mL) grape juice
      2 ts (10mL) lemon juice
      1 tb (15mL) powdered pectin
  1 3/4 c  (420mL) sugar
 
  Combine grape juice, lemon juice and pectin in a three-quart
  microwave-safe bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap or waxed paper and
  bring to a boil in the microwave oven on high setting (about 5
  minutes). Remove from oven and add sugar.  Stir until sugar
  dissolves, then return to oven. Bring mixture to a boil on high
  setting (about 4 minutes).  Remove from the oven and stir. Return the
  uncovered mixture to the oven and cook until jelly sheets from a
  spoon (about 1 minute). Skim foam: pour into sterilized jars. Adjust
  caps. Yield: about 2 half-pints (480 mL).
  
  From: The Ball Blue Book Shared By: Pat Stockett
  
  The jelly will only be as good as the juice you use is. Jelly must be
  boiling hot to achieve a seal when using vacuum lids and metal screw
  bands. Pour jelly into jar, holding ladle or kettle close to the top
  of the jar. This prevents air bubbles from forming. Quickly fill jar
  to within 1/8 inch (3mm) of the top. Wipe top and threads with a
  clean, damp cloth. Put hot lid on with sealing compound next to jar.
  Screw band on evenly and tightly.  Invert jar for a few seconds so
  hot jelly can destroy any mold or yeast which may have settled on the
  lid. Cool, test for seal, remove bands and store.
  
  Or:
  
  Jelly glasses are filled in a manner similar to jars, except a 1/2
  inch head space (13mm) is left at the top. Then the jelly is
  immediately covered with a 1/8 inch (3mm) layer of melted, but not
  smoking paraffin. A single, thin layer of paraffin holds a seal
  better than a thick layer. To insure a good seal, paraffin must touch
  all sides of the glass. Prick any air bubbles that appear on the
  paraffin.  Bubbles cause holes to appear as the paraffin hardens, and
  an imperfect seal may result. Allow glasses to stand until paraffin
  hardens and then cover with metal lids. Store in a cool, dark, dry
  place.  Make only one batch at a time.

           - microwave
           - small-to-medium size paper
           Sack (heavier brown sacks,
           Heavier than
           The bulk brown paper lunch
           Bags, seems to work the
           Best; they seem to
           Be the "right weight".
           - Orville Redenbacher's Hot
           Air popcorn (this seems to
           Work the
           Best for me).
 
  Put some kernels into bag, and put bag into microwave. (I fold the
  open end over once.) As microwaves seem to very greatly, I won't
  recommend temps or times; I usually have to experiment a little with
  every "new" microwave that I encounter. I'd probably start with the
  temp that you'd use for regular microwave popcorn. Of course, time is
  influenced by the amt of popcorn kernels.
  
  I hover around the microwave until the rate of popping slows down. I
  then remove and enjoy! (I like it unadorned.) I'm willing to put up
  with the occasional bag with a lot of unpopped kernels as I much
  prefer this to the alternative. I can keep paper sacks and popcorn in
  my desk easily enough.
  
  I started doing it this way several years ago, but recently I've had
  two different people comment on this, so I was inspired to pass it on
  (as I'm munching and typing ;-).

  MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Prepare muffin batter as directed above. Using
  6 cup microwave-safe muffin pan, line each with 2 paper baking cups
  to absorb moisture during baking. Fill cups 1/2 full. Sprinkle top of
  each muffin with cornflake crumbs.  Microwave 6 muffins on HIGH for 2
  1/2 to 3 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out
  clean, rotating pan 1/2 turn halfway through baking.  Remove muffins
  from pan and immediatedly discard outer baking cups. Cool 1 minute on
  wire rack before serving. Repeat with remaining batter.
  
  Sylvia's comments: I don't have a microwave-safe muffin pan, so just
  baked them in the oven.  The tops had the tipped-hat look I sometimes
  get in breadmachine bread, and Peter commented that the muffins
  tasted just like my bread.  It's not a bad recipe, but it's not good
  enough that I want to keep it.

  reverse the process to make my own brown sugar. Add as much or as
  little molasses to your white sugar as you like. I do the same thing
  to light corn syrup.

      Title: MICROWAVE ROASTED CHICKEN
 Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This looks like good opportunity to repost one of the few things that
  I make in the microwave.  It turns out so good that it's almost
  enough to make me think that microwaves are good for something
  besides defrosting the parrot food.
  
  This isn't a recipe per se but rather a method of 'browning' a
  chicken in the microwave.  You can combine the process with other
  recipes and come up with a really delicious, visually appealing dish.
  This is from "Micro Wave Meats Step-Step." It's part of the Micro
  Wave Cooking School series put out by Litton. Barbara Methven wrote
  it.
  
  "When a whole chicken is microwaved uncovered, it is similar to
  conventionally roasted.  The skin does not crisp but it developes some
  browning.  For more even color, use a browning agent or a glaze. To
  prevent streaking, scrub off any oily film on the chicken skin with a
  vegetable brush and hot water before applying the browning mixture.
  
  "Wash and dry chicken well.  Mix equal parts bouquet sauce and melted
  butter; rub or brush it into skin. (If preferred, glaze chicken after
  half the cooking time.)
  
  "Place chicken breast side down in baking dish. Microwave at High for
  first 3 minutes.  Reduce power to 50% (Medium). Microwave for
  remainder of first half of time.
  
  "Turn breast side up.  (Glaze, if desired.) Microwave for second half
  of time, or until legs move freely and inner thigh meat is done." The
  bouquet sauce she refers to is Kitchen Bouquet or any similar
  product. I've used thick soy with good results.  (Add a little sherry
  and ginger and you end up with Soy Sauce Chicken.) It's best to rub
  the sauce in with your fingers.  If you use a brush it will probably
  cover as uniformly. About 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine and an
  equal amount of soy or bouquet seem to be about right for a whole
  chicken.
  
  The result is really amazing.  The chicken comes out moist and
  tender, much like a Chinese steamed chicken only brown. It's good
  just that way with various Oriental dips++mustard, chopped up green
  onions, hoisin sauce, etc.++if you're into that.  I don't use my
  microwave much for primary cooking but this is one dish that I do use
  it for. In fact, I got so hungry looking at the pictures that I think
  I'll go nuke one now!

      Title: MICROWAVE ROUX
 Categories: Cajun
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Oil
    2/3 c  Flour
      2 c  Onion, chopped
      1 c  Celery, chopped
    1/2 c  Green bell pepper, chopped
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
    1/4 c  Green onion tops, chopped
           -Approximately 1/4 cup hot
           -water
 
  While we are both good at whipping up perfect rouxs as needed, we have
  found this to be a very easy and excellent method which is one fast
  way to start a gumbo or sauce piquant or other concoction. This is
  tricky only in that you must adjust it to your individual microwave
  and utensils for proper timing. With this quantity of oil in a
  microwave, it gets hotter than you realize very fast and can't be
  easily stopped. It will go from pale to burnt quickly if you are not
  careful but it didn't take us long to master. Cooking the greens this
  way is equivalent to how we would likely start a gumbo in a black pot
  on the stovetop. Try it and you may never worry about the standard
  method. Local experts have not detected any taste differences.
  
  MICRO-ROUX
  
  ROUX is an equal mixture of oil and flour that is browned and used as
  a thickening base for many of the South Louisiana dishes such as
  stews, gumbos, etouffes and sauce piquantes. It not only thickens,
  but it also gives a different, quite distinct flavor due to the
  browning of the flour.
  
  Cooking Time: 12 minutes Utensil: 4-cup glass measuring cup Makes 4
  cups
  
  1. Mix oil and flour together in a 4-cup measure. Microwave uncovered
  on HIGH 6-7 MINUTES. Stir at 6 minutes - Roux will be a light brown
  at this time and will need to cook 30 seconds to 1 minute longer to
  reach the dark brown color so important in making Louisiana gumbos
  and stews. The Roux will be very hot, but usually the handle on your
  glass measuring cup will stay cool enough to touch.
  
  2. Add onion, celery and bell pepper to Roux in measuring cup. Stir
  and return to Microwave. Saute, on HIGH 3 MINUTES.
  
  3. Add garlic, parsley and green onion to Roux, stir and return to
  Microwave. Saute on HIGH 2 MINUTES. You should have about 3-3/4 cups
  of Roux now. If any oil has risen to the top, pour this off.
  
  4. Slowly add enough hot tap water to bring Roux to the 4 cup mark.
  Stir and you will have a smooth dark Roux in only 12 minutes.
  
  Roux freezes very well and you are ready at any time to put together a
  delicious gumbo or stew.

      Title: MICROWAVE TIPS - LASAGNE
 Categories: Info, Pasta
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  A trick I learned while working as a microwave oven demonstrator is
  that cooked lasagne noodles may be replaced by layering flour
  tortillas and thinly sliced Monterey Jack cheese.
  
  I've found the most convenient way to do this is to slice the tor-
  tillas into 1.5" to 2" strips and placing the jack cheese evenly on
  top. Layer as you would the cooked noodles. While cooking, the two
  blend together. The result is indistinguishable from using cooked
  noodles except that you will experience an extra richness. If the
  recipe you're using is very simple you may even find the results to
  be better than using the actual noodles since it does add a very
  desirable richness and texture.
  
  I do not recommend that you use this method in a conventional oven.
  I've tried it and the tortilla/cheese combination seemed to turn to
  mush and lose its definition. Submitted by Lawren Freebody @ Salata

      4 c  Lowfat or skim milk
    1/4 c  Nonfat dry milk (optional)
      2 tb Fresh yogurt
 
  Pour the milk into a quart glass container.  If you want to add
  nonfat dry milk to make the yogurt "creamier" now's the time. Heat in
  microwave until the milk reaches about 175 degrees. (Takes about 9
  minutes.) Remove from microwave and cool until the milk reaches about
  100 degrees. Add two tablespoons active yogurt. Stir well, a whisk is
  good. Cover with plastic wrap.  Wrap in a towel. Replace bowl in
  microwave. Heat on low about 30 seconds. Heat on low 30 seconds every
  30-60 minutes for about 4 hours. You'll have yogurt. If you walk away
  all day but leave it nice and warm, it'll turn into yogurt, too, but
  will take longer. And since you won't be there, you won't notice.
  Refrigerate and laugh at Dannon's high prices.

    1/4 ts Ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Honey
      8    Beef ribs, about 4 pounds
 
  Here are a few more BBQ recipes I found in a July food supplement.
  Scanning sure is great.  I'm finally making progress on my huge pile
  of newspapers! I've never used the microwave for cooking ribs, but I
  imagine precooking them would serve the same purpose as parboiling
  them (which I don't do either...)
  
  Combine ketchup with the vinegar, salt, chili powder, oregano, garlic,
  pepper and honey.
  
  Mix well and marinate ribs in the mixture for 20 minutes in a
  microwave-safe dish.
  
  Cover with plastic wrap and microwave at full power for 10 minutes.
  
  Remove plastic wrap and turn ribs.
  
  Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for an other 10 minutes.
  
  Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are white-hot, or preheat a gas
  grill on high for 5 minutes with the lid closed.
  
  Grill the ribs about 4 inches from the hot coals. They will take
  about 4 minutes per side.
  
  Serves 4.

  Here are a few more BBQ recipes I found in a July food supplement.
  Scanning sure is great.  I'm finally making progress on my huge pile
  of newspapers! I've never used the microwave for cooking ribs, but I
  imagine precooking them would serve the same purpose as parboiling
  them (which I don't do either...)
  
  Combine ketchup with the vinegar, salt, chili powder, oregano, garlic,
  pepper and honey.
  
  Mix well and marinate ribs in the mixture for 20 minutes in a
  microwave-safe dish.
  
  Cover with plastic wrap and microwave at full power for 10 minutes.
  
  Remove plastic wrap and turn ribs.
  
  Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for an other 10 minutes.
  
  Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are white-hot, or preheat a gas
  grill on high for 5 minutes with the lid closed.
  
  Grill the ribs about 4 inches from the hot coals. They will take
  about 4 minutes per side.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: MID EAST MINT LAMB
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Lamb
      4    Sprigs (6in long) fresh mint
      6    Cloves garlic
      1    Sprig (3 in.) fresh lavender
      3 T  Butter
 
  The cooking is quite simple. Dice lamb into cherry sized pieces. Chop
  herbs, making certain to chop the garlic and lavender finely, and fry
  all over medium high flame till meat just done (about 5 min, but
  peoples tastes vary widely on what is cooked lamb). Tastes fantastic
  in pita bread with some hummos and tabbouleh and maybe a bit of baba
  ghannouj. If fresh herbs are unavailable, use about 2 tablespoons
  mint, and one or two teaspoons of lavender. The difference between
  the flavor of fresh and dried is enough to convince people to give up
  kitchen window sills to herbs. Also note that some people may think
  that that is a lot of garlic. We like garlic, we sometimes add more...

      1    3 to 4 pound chicken, cut up
           White pepper
           Juice of 3 lemons
      2 c  Long-grain rice
      2    Onions, chopped
      3    Garlic cloves, minced
      1    8 oz. can tomato sauce
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
           Salt
      3    Carrots, chopped
      3    Celery stalks, chopped
      1    Green bell pepper, diced
      1    16 oz. bag frozen peas
 
  Saute pine nuts in 1/2 TBSP. olive oil over medium-low heat until
  lightly browned, about 1 minute. Set aside. Place chicken in
  9x13-inch baking dish. Drizzle with 1 TBSP. olive oil and the lemon
  juice. Sprinkle with pepper. Cover tightly with foil and bake in a
  350-degree oven for 45 to 55 minutes, until juices run clear.
  Meanwhile, saute the rice in 1/2 TBSP. olive oil over medium heat
  until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Saute the onion
  and garlic in 1 TBSP. olive oil over medium heat. Stir in tomato
  sauce, cinnamon, salt to taste, carrots, celery and green pepper.
  Simmer until the vegetables are just cooked, 6 to 8 minutes. Cover
  and set aside. When the chicken is done, remove it from the pan and
  set aside until it's cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, carefully pour
  the pan juices into a large measuring cup and add enough water or
  chicken stock to make 4 cups. Add the rice and cook, covered, over
  medium-low heat until the rice is done, about 20 minutes. While the
  rice is cooking, debone the chicken and cut into bite-size pieces,
  discarding the skin and bones. Put the chicken chunks in the covered
  pan with the cooked vegetables to keep warm. Cook the peas according
  to package directions and add them to the chicken-vegetable mixture.
  When the rice is done, combine it with the chicken-vegetable mixture
  in the baking dish or another serving piece. Garnish with pine nuts
  and serve.

  Pack rolls flap side down in lined pan, sprinkling some of the
  garlic-lemon mixture and olive oil between layers of rolls. Invert a
  plate on top of the rolls to keep them intact during cooking. Add
  enough cold water to just cover rolls and put lid on firmly.
  
  Bring to the boil on medium heat, reduce to low and simmer gently for
  45 minutes.  Remove from heat and leave aside for 30 minutes. Serve
  lukewarm or cold.

 Categories: Sides
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Jalapenos
 
  I did some a couple of weeks ago, and it's worked fine. I used a
  mixture of peach and hickory; I smoked them for about 8-9 hours then
  let the fire go out. I finished them in my dehydrator then next
  morning, though I understand that fresh smoked jalapenos are also
  good (ie, not smoked to complete dryness, and stored in the freezer).
  I've got a second batch that I'll do this weekend using a different
  technique (well, red jalapeno's are only $1/lb at the farmer's
  market!) suggested in the Chipotle Cookbook (think that's the title).
  I've frozen a bag of jalapenos, and will pull them out and smoke them
  ~ apparently they collapse and carmelize more, giving a somewhat
  sweeter, smokey taste. I just do it in a typical small water smoker,
  but I've also smoked stuff in a Weber (small fire on one side, pan of
  water under grill).  I forget the temperature I used (probably around
  160F), but if you're interested email me and I'll look it up. They
  suggested that the chiles absorb all the smoke they are going to in
  4-6 hours.  I also did some serrano's and Fresno's at the same time.

      Title: MIKE ORCHEKOWSKI'S THREE-SPICE CAJUN-SPANISH
 Categories: Rice, Side dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Rice, uncooked
           Salt
           Water
      1 cn Condensed tomato soup (10oz)
           -OR
      1 cn Tomato sauce (15 oz)
           -OR
      1 cn Tomato paste (8 oz)
           Black pepper
           Red pepper flakes
           Louisiana hot pepper sauce
           Soy sauce
 
  1. Run tap water until hot. Fill container with water to cover double
  height of rice. Add rice. Let sit for 5 minutes, stirring. Drain in
  colander. (This step eliminates 90% of the surface starch from the
  rice kernels, and reduces the foam generated during cooking.)
  
  2. Fill pan with water, leaving 3/4" clear at top. Set on burner;
  bring to full rapid boil. Add salt, some soy sauce (about 1/2
  teaspoon), and a little hot sauce (about 1/2 teaspoon) to the water.
  Let boil for 1 minute WITHOUT rice. (This lets the hot sauce's solids
  "leach" their flavor into the water.) Now add rice. Bring to full
  rapid boil. Trim off the heat until the foam just barely remains. Let
  boil for 10 minutes, stirring every minute or two. Drain in colander;
  rinse pan well.
  
  3. Reduce burner heat to near-minimum. Open can of tomato soup or
  tomato paste; empty into pan. Add 1/2 to 3/4 can of water to soup (if
  using tomato paste, use full can of water); stir well. (You may
  substitute tomato sauce, omitting water.) Add soy sauce, hot sauce,
  salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to soup mixture; stir well. Place
  on burner and bring to near boil, about 2 minutes, stirring
  constantly. (This step lets the spice flavor elements "leach" into
  the tomato soup mixture.) Add rice and coat rice well. Let simmer for
  1 minute, stirring. Empty into serving dish.
  
  NOTE: The amount of salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, soy sauce, and
  Louisiana hot pepper sauce to add is up to you, depending on how
  spicy you want the rice to get. When you are adding salt to the
  water, however, I recommend 2 tablespoons at least, to get the water
  "less pure" and thus raising the boiling point. This way, the rice
  cooks faster. Also, if you want to add something to the rice to give
  some extra texture, such as a can of vegetables (corn, peas,
  garbanzos, etc.) or a can of tuna (two 6-ounce or one 12-ounce can(s)
  should do nicely), you do this as well.

      Title: MIKE STOCK BEEF WELLINGTON
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    2 Lb Beef Fillet
      1    Recipe; marinade for beef
      1    Recipe; French lining pastry
    1/4 lb Mushrooms; fresh, sliced
      1    Recipe; Anglais glaze
 
  Trim any gristle and surplus fat from the fillet, then place in a
  medium-sized bowl. Pour the marinade over the fillet and cover the
  bowl with plastic wrap. Marinate the fillet for about 4 hours, turning
  occasionally. Remove the fillet from the marinade and drain well.
  Roll out the pastry on a well-floured board to 1/8 inch thickness.
  Cut into a rectangle wide enough to overlap the fillet by 1 1/2
  inches and long enough to cover the ends well. Place the pastry
  rectangle carefully over a shallow baking dish. arrange half the
  mushrooms length-wise down the center of the pastry, then place
  fillet over the mushrooms. Arrange the remaining mushrooms over the
  fillet. Wrap, glaze, then decorate the fillet for baking according to
  the step by step instructions. Bake in a preheated 400-degree oven
  for about 40 minutes for a medium rare fillet or 50 minutes for a
  medium doneness. Serve immediately. STEP BY STEP DIRECTIONS:
  #1.Wrapping the fillet; Lift one long side of the pastry over the
  fillet and brush the edge with cold water. Lift the opposite side
  over the top of the pastry and press gently to seal. #2. Wet the
  short ends and press together sealing well. Trim off the excess
  pastry. #3. Brush the wrapped fillet with Anglais glaze. #4. Cut the
  pastry trimmings into decorative rounds, crescents or into 3/8 inch
  strips for braiding. Place over the seam on the top of the pastry.
  Brush the trim with glaze. Any unused trim may be glazed and baked
  separately until golden brown. This recipe requires three additional
  recipes that I am posting with this outline. The recipes required
  are; Mike Stock Marinade for Beef, Mike Stock french lining pastry,
  and Mike Stock Angais Glaze.

  4 1/2 lb Daikon; cut into 1/2" cubes
    1/2 c  Salt; Kosher, Diamond brand
      8    Green onions; 1" pieces
      1    Bunch; chinese chives
           -or garlic chives cut into
           -1 inch pieces

MMMMM---------------------SEASONING MIXTURE--------------------------
      1    Carrot; coarse grate
      5    Garlic cloves
      3    Celery ribs; 1/2 " thick
      1    Piece fresh gingeroot (1")
  3 1/2 tb Kim Chee pepper; from market
      2 tb Salted Shrimp; seenote
      1 tb Granulated sugar
 
  :       This is a worksheet for my Daikon Kim Chee....
   Seenote: Salted Shrimp, "Assi" brand salted jarred shrimp. highly
  recommended.
   Day One: 1. Peel the daikon and cut into 3/4" cubes. Cut the onions
  into 1 " strips and then shred lengthwise into slivers. Mix the
  daikon and onion strips in a bowl, add the 1/2 cup of salt and mix
  very well and let sit overnight.
   2. Peel and mince garlic and gingeroot.  Cut celery,carrot, and
  scallions, slice chives . Mix these ingredients together with the
  pepper and granulated sugar and combine into the daikon and onion
  mixture. Add shrimp, and chives The next day: 3. Slosh the liquid
  around the cubes of daikon to wash off the salt. Lift the cubes of
  daikon out of the brine and let them drip off in a strainer or a
  colander. In a large bowl mix the daikon and onion with the garlic
  gingeroot mixture, mix very well.
   4. Pack the daikon and onion mixture into the bottom of a crock or
  other non-metal container. Press down. Set a small weight on top of
  the cover and let sit overnight. It can be stored for a week or
  longer prior to opening. Keep it in a cool (60 degree) place. Daikon
  Kimchee will be ready to eat in 2 days....
   Mikenote: The question of whether to cover it tightly or to let the
  kim chee breathe is still up to you.... The original crocks that
  either were or were not buried in the ground, have a water seal
  around the top that lets the air out but nothing back in..... I have
  made good Kim Chee (to me), both ways... End Mikenote: 5. After
  removing the Kim Chi from the crock it can be stored in glass jars
  and used as needed. This is a medium hot recipe, if it is still not
  hot enough, diced red peppers with seeds can be added, to the daikon
  and onion mixture. Enjoy. Dramatically changed and updated by Mike

      Title: MIKE'S BBQ SAUCE FOR RIBS
 Categories: Bbq sauces
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
 10 1/2 oz Can Campbell's beef broth
           -plus one can water
      6 oz Can tomato paste
    1/2 c  Worchestershire sauce
      1 T  Liquid smoke
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
    1/2 c  Gulden's mustard
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 T  Chile powder
      1 t  Habenero hot sauce
 
  Throw  all the ingrediants into a pot, mix and bring to the point
  where it just starts to boil.  I guess a very gentle simmer would be
  a good term for it.  You want some of the liguid to boil off, but you
  do not want to burn the sauce.  Cook uncovered until you reach the
  consistency that you would like.  I'll usually cook for about 4
  hours, stiring quite a bit.
  
  If you like a thicker sauce, leave out some of the water.
  
  If you don't like to sweat with your ribs, you might cut down on the
  amount of chili powder and/or the hot sauce.

      2 ts Fresly ground black pepper
      2 ts Red pepper flakes, less for
           -sissies
      2 tb Liquid smoke
 
  Freeze the London Broil or other lean roast.  When ready to make
  jerky, remove the roast from the freezer and let partially thaw. When
  just able to slice, first remove all fat and then slice against the
  grain in thin (1/4 inch or less) slices. Cover the meat with the
  marinade, turn from time to time and let marinade overnight.  In the
  morning line a shallow cookie sheet with a few layers of paper
  towels.  Place on lower rack. Place upper rack in oven in top
  position and lower rack in lower position. Hang the beef slices from
  the upper rack with tooth picks above the paper towels. I find about
  6 hours at 160F average temp is about right.
  
  If your oven is real tight, you might crack open the door a bit to
  allow the water vapor to escape.

 Categories: Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4    Slices bacon
      1 md Onion, diced
      8 ea Cloves garlic, pressed
      1    Celery stalk, chopped
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 lb Hot Italian sausage
      1 ea Beef bouilion cube, in one
           -cup boiling water
      1 c  Dry white wine
     16 oz Can of diced tomatoes
     16 oz Can of tomato sauce
      6 oz Can tomato paste
      7 oz Can of mushrooms
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Oregano
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
 
  Thanks to Julian Manders for the start to my redition of this sauce.
  
  In the micro, do the bacon till it is leathery and done, but not
  crisp. Distribute bacon on one or two paper towels, roll them up, and
  give them a good squeeze so the paper absorbs most of the remaining
  bacon fat. Set aside.  Heat the oil in a deep, heavy non-aluminum
  kettle (an enameled cast iron casserole or large skillet will do) and
  add the vegetables. Cook, stirring, over low heat until the onions
  are translucent and the vegetables are softened.  While the veges are
  cooking, break up the sausage and fry in a separate pan till just
  done.  Drain off the fat. Let the sausage cool a bit, then stick in
  the food processor on low to break up the clumps. Now that the bacon
  has cooled, pull it apart in small bite sized pieces.
  
  To the veges, add the cooked bacon, broth and wine.  Raise the heat
  and cook until the sauce thickens a little. Add the diced tomatoes,
  paste, sauce, pepper, oregano, mushrooms, ground sausage, nutmeg, and
  stir well.
  
  When the sauce begins to bubble, lower the heat and simmer very
  slowly, partly covered, for about 4 hours.  Stir occasionally to
  prevent sticking. Before serving, taste for seasoning and adjust.
  
  I serve over rigatoni with freshly grated parmesan. A small green
  salad and a couple slices of sour dough spread with garlic butter and
  toasted under the broiler in the oven will round out the meal.  Don't
  forget the bottle of a dry red wine.  A nice Italian Chianti is in
  keeping with the heritage of the meal.

  Sears tried to deliver a damaged stove on 02/17/94. Chili was cooked
  on 02/19/94. The Daytona 500 is on Sunday the 20th. We will have ribs
  cooked in the Nesco. Linda made her potato salad and we will have
  this chili. NOTE: The crock pot was to full, use less meat or less
  liquid. NOTE: Chili was no good! We mixed it with dry dog food and
  gave it to the dogs. The meat must be browned before it is put in the

      1 lb Sweet Italian sausage
      4 ea Garlic cloves, pressed
     24 oz Tomato sauce
      6 oz Tomato paste

     16 ea Extra wide lasagna noodles
 
  Get two large frying pans. Spray with the non-stick PAM or similiar.
  Place the beef in one, the sausage in the other. As the meat starts
  to change colour, add 1/2 the onion and garlic to each pan. Saute
  till meat is brown and crumbly in both pans.  They will never get
  done at the same time. When brown, put all into one "Really Big"
  frying pan, dutch oven or whatever. Add the tomato sauce and paste,
  wine, water, oregano, pepper and a bit of salt if you are a salt
  lover. Stir, cover and cook for a couple of hours.
  
  Cook the lasagana noodles cooking as per package directions. After
  they are cooked, rinse a couple of times with cold water to cool them
  hot puppies down. Grab a deep (2-3 inch) 9 X 13 in casserole dish or
  pan. Criss cross a layer of noodles for the first layer, followed by
  about 1/3 of the sauce, then 1/3 of the ricotta and then 1/3 of the
  mozzarella. Do the pasta, sauce, ricotta and mozzarella 2 more times
  till gone. Spread the parmesan over the top.  Cook in a pre-heated
  350^ oven for
       60    minutes.
  
  One of my favorites, as well as mom's.  Freezes well and is great on
  a cold winter night when you want something warm and hearty but don't
  feel like cooking. Serve with hot sour dough garlic french bread and
  a tossed green salad.

      Title: MIKE'S SALSE DI CARNE
 Categories: Italian, Beef, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
      2 T  Olive oil
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2 md Carrots, finely chopped
      2 ea Celery stalks, finely choped
      3 ea Cloves garlic, pressed
      1 T  Dried parsley
      1 lb Lean ground beef
      2 T  All purpose flour
      1 cn Campbell's Beef Broth 10 1/2
           -oz plus equal amount water
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -and salt to taste
 
  I first process the carrots in the food processor to get them really
  chopped finely.  Then process the onion and celery to a course fine
  chop. Heat the oil in a large sauce pan and saute the onion, carrots,
  celery, garlic and parsley. When they start to soften, add the ground
  beef and fry until the meat browns.  Then stir in the soup, water,
  salt and pepper. Simmer uncovered gently for an hour or so.  Watch
  the liquid content of the sauce.  The sauce should thicken but still
  retain a little of the moisture. When ready to serve, thicken the
  sauce with the 2 plus or minus tablespoons of flour to make it thick
  and sticky. Can be served over any spaghetti or linguini, but best
  IMHO served over or on the side with Mike's Capellini with Garlic.

      Title: MIKE'S STUFFED CHICKEN BREASTS
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Chicken breasts, skinless
           -and boneless
           Salt and fresh ground black
           -to taste
      4    Thin slices processed ham
      4    Thin slices mozzarella chees
      4    Cooked asparagus spears
           Flour for dusting
      3 tb Butter
      1 tb Oil
      6 tb Marsala
      2 tb Chicken stock
           Asparagus spears to garnish
 
  Place the chicken pieces between pieces of damp waxed paper and
  beat/roll with a rolling pin until thin. Season with salt and pepper,
  place a slice of ham and cheese and an asparagus spear on each
  breast. Roll each breast up carefully, wind a piece of cotton string
  around each to hold it and dust with the flour.
  
  Heat 2 T of the butter and the oil to a saute pan and fry the chiken
  rolls until golden and done.  About 15 minutes, turning to brown on
  all sides. Remove the string and transfer to a hot serving dish and
  keep warm.
  
  Add the marsala, stock and remaining butter to the pan, bring to a
  boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, while scaping the bottom of the
  pan. Spoon this over the rolls and garnish with asparagus spears.
  
  The recipe calls for Bel Paese cheese.  I never could find it, so
  used a thin slice of Monterey Jack, Swiss or Mozzarella. Like the
  Mozzarella the best.  Doubt that you have marsala wine, so I used
  half brandy and half sherry.  Or all of one of the other depending on
  what I hadn't already drank up.  A sweet sherry effect is what you
  are looking for.
  
  OK, that is as fast as I can type.  May I go get a cup of coffee now?

           -CREAM
      2 tb LIGHT CORN SYRUP
      4 tb ALMOND LIQUEUR, SUCH AS
           -AMARETTO
 
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT: Six 3-inch metal ring molds (1 3/4 inches in
  height). Make the milk chocolate cake: Position a rack in the center
  of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Lightly butter an 11
  1/2-inch by 17 1/2-inch jellyroll pan and line the bottom with
  parchment paper. Butter the paper and dust the bottom and sides with
  cocoa powder, lightly tapping out the excess. Set the pan aside.
  
  Melt the chocolate according to the directions in the Chocolate Key.
  In a large stainless steel bowl, vigorously whisk together the egg
  yolks and the almond extract until the mixture is thick, about 1
  minute. Set aside.
  
  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the toasted almonds and the
  flour and process until the nuts are ground to a fine powder. In a 4
  1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the paddle
  attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until it is pale and soft
  peaks begin to form, about 3 to 5 minutes. Lower the speed, add the
  zest and the almond flour and mix until well combined, about 2 to 3
  minutes. Add the reserved chocolate, then the yolks, mixing just
  until combined.
  
  In a dry, grease-free 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer
  with the wire whip attachment, beat the egg whites on low speed until
  frothy. Increase the speed to medium and beat until soft peaks begin
  to form, 2 to 3 minutes, then gradually add the sugar. Increase the
  speed to high and continue to beat until the whites are glossy and
  hold stiff peaks when the whip is lifted, 1 to 2 more minutes.
  
  Using a large rubber spatula, mix 1/3 of the whites into the
  chocolate-almond-butter mixture to lighten it . Gently and quickly
  fold in another third of the whites. Fold in the remaining whites.
  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly with an
  offset metal spatula. Bake for 30 minutes until the cake springs back
  when lightly touched and the sides pull away from the pan. Cool in
  the pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack and remove
  the parchment paper. When the cake has cooled, cut out 18 cake rounds
  using a 3-inch by 1 3/4- inch metal ring mold. Set the cake rounds
  aside until ready to assemble the dessert.
  
  Make the milk chocolate-orange cream: Place the chopped chocolate
  into a medium stainless steel bowl. In a medium saucepan, bring the
  cream to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the cream over
  the chocolate. Allow the mixture to stand for 30 seconds to melt the
  chocolate; whisk gently until smooth. Stir in the orange liqueur.
  Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.

      Title: MILK CHOCOLATE ORANGE CAKES PART 2 OF 2
 Categories: Cake, Chocolate, Godiva
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
  Continued:
  
  When chilled, transfer the chocolate-cream to a 4 1/2 quart bowl of a
  heavy-duty electric mixer with the wire whip attachment. Beat on
  medium speed until the mixture is light in color and soft peaks start
  to form. Do not overbeat or the mixture will be grainy. Refrigerate
  until ready to use.
  
  Make the dark chocolate curls: Warm the chocolate slightly by placing
  it on a piece of waxed paper in a microwave oven set on MEDIUM (50
  percent) power for 20 second intervals, until it begins to soften.
  This can take 3 to 6 tries, depending on the wattage of the microwave
  oven, type and brand of chocolate and the heat of the kitchen. The
  chocolate should soften slightly, not melt. Alternatively, soften the
  chocolate by placing it about 6 inches beneath the warm bulb of a
  desk lamp for 5 to 10 minutes, turning it every couple of minutes,
  until it begins to soften.
  
  Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Grip a square of chocolate with
  a paper towel so your hand does not melt the chocolate. Using a sharp
  vegetable peeler, scrape one side of the square of chocolate in a
  downward motion, forming loosely shaped curls. As you form the curls,
  let the curls drop onto the paper-lined baking sheet. (Chocolate that
  is only slightly softened will form tight curls; overly heated
  chocolate will curl very little.) Refrigerate the curls on the baking
  sheet until you are ready to garnish the cakes.
  
  Make the orange compote: With a sharp paring knife, peel the oranges
  and cut them into segments. Cut each segment into 3 pieces. In a
  medium saucepan combine the orange juice and the honey and bring to a
  boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the juice
  begins to thicken and turn syrupy, about 3 to 4 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, dissolve the cornstarch in the orange liqueur. When the
  orange juice mixture has reduced, add the cornstarch mixture and
  whisk until the mixture thickens. Simmer for 30 seconds; remove the
  pan from the heat. Fold in the reserved orange segments. Set aside to
  cool.
  
  Make the milk chocolate glaze: Place the chopped chocolate into a
  medium stainless steel bowl. In a medium saucepan bring the heavy
  cream and corn syrup to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and pour
  the cream over the chocolate. Stir in the almond liqueur. Assemble
  the cakes:
  
  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange six 3- inch-by-1
  3/4-inch metal rings on the paper. Place a cake round in the bottom
  of each ring.
  
  Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip (such as Ateco #5)
  with the whipped milk chocolate-orange cream. Pipe a thin layer of
  the milk chocolate-orange cream over the cake rounds. Press another
  cake round into each ring, and repeat with a layer of the milk
  chocolate cream. Place the final cake rounds into the ring and finish
  the tops with the remaining milk chocolate-orange cream. Using a
  metal spatula, scrape across the tops of the rings to smooth and
  level the cream. Chill the cakes for 1 hour or until firm.
  
  Glaze the cakes: Using a damp (not wet) very hot towel, carefully
  heat the outside of the metal rings and push the cakes up from the
  bottoms to unmold. Arrange the cakes on a wire rack set over a baking
  sheet to catch the excess glaze.
  
  Pour the warm milk chocolate glaze over the cakes, coating each one
  completely. Use a metal spatula to touch up any missed spots on the
  sides. When the glaze has set slightly, decorate the tops with the
  dark chocolate curls.
  
  Serve the cakes at room temperature with the orange compote.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           MILK CHOCOLATE CAKE:
      6 oz MILK CHOCOLATE -- COARSELY
      5    LARGE EGG YOLKS
      2    Teaspoons     ALMOND EXTRACT
 
  3/4  cup           TOASTED SLIVERED ALMONDS 1/2 cup ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
  10 tablespoons   UNSALTED BUTTER -- CUT PIECES
        1    teaspoon      ORANGE ZEST
        7    LARGE EGG WHITES 1/4 cup GRANULATED SUGAR MILK
  CHOCOLATE-ORANGE CREAM: 7 ounces MILK CHOCOLATE -- FINELY
  
      3/4    cup           HEAVY CREAM 3 tablespoons ORANGE LIQUEUR --
  SUCH AS MARNIER DARK CHOCOLATE CURLS: 2 ounces (OR LARGER) CHUNK
  SEMISWEET -- CHOCOLATE ORANGE COMPOTE:
        3    NAVEL ORANGES
      1/2    cup           ORANGE JUICE
        2    tablespoons   HONEY
        2    teaspoons     CORNSTARCH 2 tablespoons ORANGE LIQUEUR --
  SUCH AS MARNIER MILK CHOCOLATE GLAZE: 12 ounces MILK CHOCOLATE --
  FINELY
  
  1/2  cup           PLUS 3 TABLESPOONS HEAVY -- CREAM 2 tablespoons
  LIGHT CORN SYRUP 4 tablespoons ALMOND LIQUEUR -- SUCH AS SPECIAL
  EQUIPMENT: Six 3-inch metal ring molds (1 3/4 inches in height). Make
  the milk chocolate cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven
  and preheat to 325 degrees F. Lightly butter an 11 1/2-inch by 17
  1/2-inch jellyroll pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.
  Butter the paper and dust the bottom and sides with cocoa powder,
  lightly tapping out the excess. Set the pan aside.
  
  Melt the chocolate according to the directions in the Chocolate Key.
  In a large stainless steel bowl, vigorously whisk together the egg
  yolks and the almond extract until the mixture is thick, about 1
  minute. Set aside.
  
  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the toasted almonds and the
  flour and process until the nuts are ground to a fine powder. In a 4
  1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the paddle
  attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until it is pale and soft
  peaks begin to form, about 3 to 5 minutes. Lower the speed, add the
  zest and the almond flour and mix until well combined, about 2 to 3
  minutes. Add the reserved chocolate, then the yolks, mixing just
  until combined.
  
  In a dry, grease-free 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer
  with the wire whip attachment, beat the egg whites on low speed until
  frothy. Increase the speed to medium and beat until soft peaks begin
  to form, 2 to 3 minutes, then gradually add the sugar. Increase the
  speed to high and continue to beat until the whites are glossy and
  hold stiff peaks when the whip is lifted, 1 to
        2    more minutes.
  
  Using a large rubber spatula, mix 1/3 of the whites into the
  chocolate-almond-butter mixture to lighten it . Gently and quickly
  fold in another third of the whites. Fold in the remaining whites.
  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly with an
  offset metal spatula. Bake for 30 minutes until the cake springs back
  when lightly touched and the sides pull away from the pan. Cool in
  the pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack and remove
  the parchment paper. When the cake has cooled, cut out 18 cake rounds
  using a 3-inch by 1 3/4-inch metal ring mold. Set the cake rounds
  aside until ready to assemble the dessert.
  
  Make the milk chocolate-orange cream: Place the chopped chocolate
  into a medium stainless steel bowl. In a medium saucepan, bring the
  cream to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the cream over
  the chocolate. Allow the mixture to stand for 30 seconds to melt the
  chocolate; whisk gently until smooth. Stir in the orange liqueur.
  Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.

  Continued:
  
  When chilled, transfer the chocolate-cream to a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a
  heavy-duty electric mixer with the wire whip attachment. Beat on
  medium speed until the mixture is light in color and soft peaks start
  to form. Do not overbeat or the mixture will be grainy. Refrigerate
  until ready to use. Make the dark chocolate curls: Warm the chocolate
  slightly by placing it on a piece of waxed paper in a microwave oven
  set on MEDIUM (50 percent) power for 20 second intervals, until it
  begins to soften. This can take 3 to 6 tries, depending on the
  wattage of the microwave oven, type and brand of chocolate and the
  heat of the kitchen. The chocolate should soften slightly, not melt.
  Alternatively, soften the chocolate by placing it about 6 inches
  beneath the warm bulb of a desk lamp for 5 to 10 minutes, turning it
  every couple of minutes, until it begins to soften.
  
  Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Grip a square of chocolate with
  a paper towel so your hand does not melt the chocolate. Using a sharp
  vegetable peeler, scrape one side of the square of chocolate in a
  downward motion, forming loosely shaped curls. As you form the curls,
  let the curls drop onto the paper-lined baking sheet. (Chocolate that
  is only slightly softened will form tight curls; overly heated
  chocolate will curl very little.  ) Refrigerate the curls on the
  baking sheet until you are ready to garnish the cakes.
  
  Make the orange compote: With a sharp paring knife, peel the oranges
  and cut them into segments. Cut each segment into 3 pieces. In a
  medium saucepan combine the orange juice and the honey and bring to a

  the cakes:
  
  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange six 3- inch-by-1
  3/4-inch metal rings on the paper. Place a cake round in the bottom
  of each ring.

  the tops with the remaining milk chocolate-orange cream. Using a
  metal spatula, scrape across the tops of the rings to smooth and
  level the cream. Chill the cakes for 1 hour or until firm.
  
  Glaze the cakes: Using a damp (not wet) very hot towel, carefully
  heat the outside of the metal rings and push the cakes up from the
  bottoms to unmold. Arrange the cakes on a wire rack set over a baking
  sheet to catch the excess glaze.
  
  Pour the warm milk chocolate glaze over the cakes, coating each one

 Categories: Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  More from the Sydney Morning Herald.  Simplicity itself, this
  French-derived recipe preserves all the tenderness of baby lamb and it
  gives it the intense flavour it tends to lack. The lamb can be cooked
  in an oven-proof, glass chicken-roaster or baked in foil (use at
  least two layers to ensure the parcel does not leak). Having a
  tablespoon or two of jellied stock always at hand is difficult for
  the home-cook, unless you remember always to treasure the cooking
  liquids after baking meats. Pour them into a small container and
  refrigerate -jelled stock separates out underneath a layer of fat
  which seals and preserves the stock.
  
  A leg of suckling lamb weighs about 1 kg.  If you don't want to go to
  the expense of buying suckling lamb, buy the smallest lamb leg you
  can, probably around 1.5 kg. If you are baking the lamb in foil,
  start by browning the leg all over in a pan brushed with olive oil
  (not necessary if using a glass roaster).
  
  Cut 4 cloves of garlic into slivers, make slits all over the lamb
  with a sharp knife and tuck the garlic slivers inside.
  
  Dust the leg with salt and pepper, put it in the roaster or on foil,
  add a generous handful of fresh tarragon leaves or a tablespoon of
  dried, and 1 or 2 tablespoons jellied veal or chicken stock. Put the
  lid on the roaster or wrap the leg loosely in foil, sealing the seams
  securely to prevent juices escaping.
  
  Roast at 190C for between 35 minutes (suckling lamb wrapped in foil,
  still pink inside) and 1 hour (larger leg in roaster, well done).
  Rest for 10 minutes before carving. Serve with the juices spooned
  over the meat. Good with creamy mashed potato to absorb the juices.

  "Millet is an excellent grain which is too often overlooked. It adds

  with a fresh fruit salad. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to
  350~F.
  
  Stir together the millet, flours, and salt in a large bowl or in the
  food processor. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal. Warm the milk in a small saucepan. Dissolve the honey in
  the warm milk. Add this sweetened milk to the flour mixture and blend
  to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. If
  necessary, add a little more milk.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, maximum 1/8 inch. With a sharp
  knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares and place them on a lightly
  greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Prick each square 2 or 3
  times with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 10 minutes. Turn over and continue baking another 10 to 15

      2 tb Sesame oil
  1 1/2 ts Dill weed

      1 c  Pistachio nuts (optional)
           -OR- roasted sunflower seeds
      3 tb Unbleached flour
      3 tb Gluten flour
 
  You can serve this versatile loaf for lunch or as an appetizer. Place
  slices on a bed of Bibb lettuce with vegetable garnishes and a light,
  creamy salad dressing.
       ************************************************** *********
  
  Rinse the millet and put it in a medium saucepan with the water and
  1/2 teaspoon sea salt.  Cook the millet, covered, over medium heat
  for about 30 minutes or until soft; the millet should absorb all of
  the water. (If the grains are too moist, the loaf will not bind
  properly.)
  
  Saute the carrots, celery, onions, and garlic in oil for 6 minutes, or
  until the onions are translucent. Add the seasonings, including the
  remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. Mix the cooked millet and the
  vegetables together, along with the nuts or seeds, if you wish. Mix
  the two flours together and add them to the millet mixture, blending
  it well so the loaf will hold together.
  
  Lightly oil and flour a large loaf pan.  Press the millet mixture
  into the pan and bake in a preheated oven at 400 degrees F for about
  one hour. (If the millet mixture is warm when you put it in the pan,
  reduce the baking time to about 45 minutes.)  Allow the loaf to cool
  for 10 minutes, then carefully remove it from the pan. To avoid
  breaking the loaf, you may wish to slice it while it is still in the
  pan.

    1/4 c  Maple syrup; or other liquid
           -sweetener
    1/4 ts Sea salt; opt, up to 1/2 tsp
    3/4 c  Nuts, ground; or seeds
           -up to 1 cup

MMMMM-----------------------FRUIT FILLING----------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Dried apricots, dates, figs
           -or other dried fruit
           -chopped
      4    Pineapple rings, dried
           -chopped or another 1/4 c
           -chopped dried fruit
      3 ts Lemon rind;grated up to 4 ts

      4 tb Lemon juice; or orange or
           -pineapple juice, up to 5 Tb
    3/4 c  -Water
 
    Cook the millet in the water for about 45 minutes and cool. Preheat
  the oven to 350F. Gently stir the sweetener and salt into the millet
  and spread half the mixture in an oiled 9" x 9" square pan. Sprinkle
  1/4 - 1/2 cup of nuts over it and bake for 10 minutes. Let cool.
  
    While the millet is cooking, combine the fruit filling ingredients
  in a saucepan, bring to a low boil, then simmer on low to medium heat
  for 30-45 minutes or until the fruit can be stirred easily into a
  mushy fruit spread. Allow to cool completely.
  
    Use most of the fruit mixture (depending on how sweet you would
  like the squares to be) and spread it over the first layer of baked
  millet. Sprinkle on more ground nuts if desired. Add the last of the
  cooled millet mixture and spread it evenly over the fruit. Add
  additional ground nuts or seeds if desired. Bake for about 20 minutes
  more at 350F until somewhat drier and firm. Cool completely and chill
  to help set the squares.
  
    Serve at room temperature. Keeps 6-8 days refrigerated. Great for
  lunches and snacks too. Some prefer this as a dessert, as is, or with
  1/4 cup or more powdered natural sweetener added to the millet.
  
  MAKES: 9-16 SQUARES
  
  VARIATION:  EASY MILLET-FRUIT PARFAITS Prepare the hot millet and
  fruit filling as in the Millet-Fruit Squares above). Optional dry
  cereal or granola may also be added. Layer a parfait glass with the
  millet mixture, then ground nuts or seeds, fruit filling, then
  additional dry cereal if desired. Repeat the layering and top with
  nuts, raisins or coconut. Chill and serve for breakfast or dessert.
  If a sweeter dessert is desired add extra powdered natural sweetener
  to the millet mixture. MAKES: 8-14

      Title: MILLET-PEACH PUDDING
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Whole millet, rinsed
      2 c  Water
    1/4 ts Salt
      1    Ripe peach or 1 - 2 ripe
           -nectarines, pureed
    1/4 ts To 1/2 ts ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
      1 tb To 2 tb almond oil
    1/4 ts Pure almond extract
      3 tb Chopped, toasted almonds,
           -optional
    1/2    Ripe peach or 1 nectarine,
           -diced
 
  Servings: 2
  
  This combination makes a fragrant, satisfying end product. If you
  forget the overnight soak you can still make the recipe (see note).
  
  Directions:
  
  Soak the millet in 2 c water overnight.  Without draining, bring the
  millet, water, and salt to a boil. Reduce the heat and let the pudding
  simmer about 25 min until tender.
  
  Remove the pot from heat and add the fruit, spices, oil and extract.
  Beat hard for a few strokes.  Gently stir in the diced fruit. Divide
  into two bowls and top them with chopped almonds.
  
  Note: If you want to make this pudding but forgot to soak the millet
  overnight, simmer it 35 min over very low heat. Remove from the stove,
  fluff with a fork and cover for 10 more min. Millet or any grain,
  however, is more digestible when soaked or slow-cooked for hours.

      Title: MIMOSA ICE CREAM CREPES WITH BUTTERED HONEY
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Crepes
           Mimosa blossoms
    1/2 c  Milk
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
    1/2 c  Sugar (less 1 tablespoon)
      2    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Light flower honey
    1/4 c  Sweet butter
 
  TO CRISP CREPES:  Heat the oven to 375 F and put as many crepes as
  will fit in a single layer on a rack - a cooling rack will do. They
  must be spaced apart for air to circulate around them. Set the rack
  over a cookie sheet, making sure air can circulate under the crepes,
  and put them in the oven. Start  checking them after about 2 minutes.
  When they are crisp all around their edges but you can still fold
  them in the center, take them out and let them cool, folded in half,
  on another rack. Repeat until you have one for each serving, then put
  them on plates and fill.
  
  FOR ICE CREAM: Strip the mimosa blossoms from their stems and leaves.
  You will need 1 cup of blossoms. Put them in a non-corroding saucepan
  with the milk, cream, and sugar, and heat to 200 F, or just under
  boiling. Let steep for about 30 minutes, keeping the temperature at
  190 F to 200 F. Whisk the egg yolks slightly in a small bowl and pour
  in some of the hot milk mixture, stirring constantly, until the
  custard coats a spoon. Strain into a bowl, pressing flowers to
  extract the flavor. Chill thoroughly. Freeze according to the
  instructions with your ice cream maker.
  
  Serve in crisped crepes.  Sprinkle a few mimosa blossoms on the ice
  cream and drizzle with buttered honey - honey warmed with sweet
  butter - over and around the crepes.

    1/2 c  Diced candied orange peel
  1 1/4 c  Light brown sugar
    2/3 c  Dark rum or brandy
    1/4 c  Distilled white vinegar
      8 tb Unsalted butter -- (1
           Stick)
      1 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
           Double batch Sour Cream
           Dough for a -- above
      2    Crust pie
           Egg Wash: 1 egg well beaten
           With a pinch
           Salt
      2 ts Sugar for finishing the top
           The pies -- optional
           Two 9inch Pyrex pie pans
 
  To make the filling, peel, halve and core the apples. Grate them
  coarsely by hand or in the food processor. Place the grated apples in
  a large nonreactive saucepan. Grate the zest of both the oranges and
  lemons, then squeeze both fruits and strain the juice and add it with
  the zest into the pan. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to a
  simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally. Continue cooking for
  about 45 minutes longer, stirring often this scorches easily until
  the mixture is reduced to a thick, jamlike consistency. Let cool. Set
  racks at the middle and lowest levels of the oven and preheat to 400
  degrees. Divide the double batch of dough into quarters. Roll one
  quarter out to form a bottom crust and arrange in pan. Repeat with
  the second piece. Spread half the mincemeat evenly in each crust.
  Form the lattice top crusts. Flute the edge of the pies and carefully
  brush with egg wash. If you wish, sprinkle the top of each pie with
  sugar. Bake the pies for 15 minutes on the bottom rack of the oven.
  Lower the temperature to 350 degrees and move the pies to the middle
  rack. Bake about 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the crust is a deep
  golden and the juices are just beginning to bubble up. Cool pies on
  racks and serve warm or at room temperature. Yield: two 9-inch pies

  This is frequently served at special occasions in Chinese restaurants.
  Presented as an appetizer, it will serve 6.
  
  USING A THIN CLEAVER, cut away the wings and thigh joints and pull
  off the skin, cutting it where necessary. Set the skin aside. Bone
  the breasts. Scrape all the meat you can from the bone. Neatness does
  not count! To remove the leg meat, make a slit the length of the leg
  to the bone. Pull the meat away, cutting it off the bone where
  necessary. Remove the small but tough tendon from each leg. Bone the
  second squab, then add the bones, feet, heads and wings to 1 cup
  chicken broth and reduce the liquid to 1/2 cup. With 2 cleavers,
  start chopping the meat, until finely minced. Set aside. Thinly slice
  the squab skin. Stir-fry the skin in a little oil to render the fat
  and crisp the skin. This takes about 10 minutes. As the skin browns,
  move it up the side of the wok. Set the crisped skin aside. The
  preceding steps can be done up to 8 hours in advance. Keep the minced
  squab refrigerated if it must stand longer than 1 hour. Stir-fry the
  squab in the oil with the garlic over high heat until is is browned
  lightly. Add the remaining minced ingredients, mix them well and add
  the reduced chicken broth, sugar, soy sauce, rice wine or sherry and
  oyster sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil and stir in the cornstarch
  dissolved in broth. Stir in the crisped skin and transfer the mixture
  to a serving plate. Serve the dish surrounded by lettuce cups. Each
  diner wraps some of the squab mixture in a lettuce cup.

 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     50    Cotton balls, plain
           OR
           Cotton wool, 3 by 6 feet
      2 lb Bittersweet chocolate
    1/2 c  Liqueur, any favorite
           -[optional]
 
  If starting from cotton wool, divide it into about 50 pieces, making
  sure they are well formed, round, and the rough edges have been
  worked back into the mass to make a smooth surface.
  
  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler being careful not to get any
  water in the chocolate.
  
  In batches of about ten put the balls of cotton on a fine rack or
  grate. Sprinkle with the liqueur if you're using it. [Be careful! Too
  much will overpower the other flavors.]
  
  Slowly pour enough chocolate over each ball of cotton to coat it
  thoroughly, letting excess drip off. Allow the chocolate coating to
  cool before taking the chocolate covered cotton from the rack.
  
  Keep stored in a closed container in a cool place away from light.
  Munitions boxes work well for this.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate covered cotton -- This is a recipe I invented after I had
  cornered the cotton market and couldn't get rid of the stuff.
  
  While good orlon can be substituted for the cotton, the resulting
  product won't have the same flavor or texture as the real thing. Your
  friends will be able to tell that you've been skimping. Egyptian
  cotton works best. Yield: About fifty servings.
  
  *  As a special cold-weather treat, use wool instead of cotton.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  2 hours.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      8    Eggs, small;hard boiled
 
  Passover Chicken Soup with Rice      *matza meal is available at some
  supermarkets and Jewish grocery stores
  
  "I did not learn of the traditional matza ball soup served during the
  first two nights of Passover until I came to this country. Our
  classic soup was a chicken soup with rice to which were added balls
  of chicken breast and whole immature eggs (which are still at the
  stage where the outer shell and white have not yet formed; they are
  perfectly round and vary from less than 1" to less than 1 mm in
  diameter.) It was a beautiful soup to look at, with the white rice,
  the golden meat balls, the orange eggs (from chickens raised on
  private farms ...)...Here in America I could never find immature
  eggs, so I replace them with hard boiled egg yolks.
  
  Grind or finely chop the chicken broth. In a bowl, combine the beaten
  egg with matza meal and 2 Tbsp of water or broth. Mix well; add
  ground chicken, salt, spices and mix well again. Set aside to rest in
  the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. Shape the mixture into tiny
  balls, no larger than the egg yolks. Bring the broth to a boil; add
  rice, chicken balls and cook, covered for 15-20 minutes. Peel eggs,
  discard whites and place one hard boiled egg yolk in each of the
  eight bowls. Pour the soup over the egg yolks and serve immediately.

      1 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt (opt)
    3/4 c  Ff yogurt
  1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
      2    Egg whites
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Mini-chips
 
  make just like cookies- mix yogurt and sugar together, add egg
  whites, then flour, etc.  I baked it at 350 deg. for about 25 minutes
  or so. It turned brown really fast, so I tested it with a toothpick.
  The only thing that has a considerable amount of fat in it should be
  the mini chocolate chips, but that was kind of the point. I used a
  rectangular cake pan, sprayed with pam and dusted with sugar (that's
  what we always did in my family). They are really chewy and kind of
  hard to cut, because of the chewiness.

  Peel, core and thinly slice the green apple and the peaches. Using a
  pastry brush, paint a thin layer of peach glaze (combined jam and
  lemon juice) on the pastry circle (leaving a small rim of bare
  pastry). Layer apples and peaches on the peach-glazed pastry,
  layering up to about 1 1/2 inches high. Sprinkle with a small amount
  of sugar and a pinch of nutmeg.

  4 1/2 c  Flour (may need up to 5)
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Margarine; room temperature
      2 c  Sugar
      2 ea Eggs
      2 tb Milk
      2 ts Vanilla extract
           Egg wash

MMMMM-----------------------FOR DECORATING----------------------------
           #5,#7 round and #27 star tip
           Three decorating bags
           Decorating icing
           Colored sugar
           Assorted candies
           Decorating bag with coupler
 
       Make the cookie dough:  Stir or whisk together 4 1/2 cups of the
  flour, the baking powder and salt; set aside. Cream the butter and
  sugar until light; add the eggs, milk, and vanilla and beat well.
  Gradually add the dry ingredients and blend to form a smooth ball of
  dough. If the dough is sticky, add just enough of the remaining flour
  to eliminate the stickiness. The dough should not be dry. Divide the
  dough in half, wrap each ball in plastic and refrigerate for several
  hours, or until firm enough to roll.
       Meanwhile, cut cardboard templates for the base and the three
  parts of the cookie house.  The dimensions are as follows: THE BASE:
  is a circle 6" across (cut 1)  THE SIDE: is a rectangle 2 3/8" x 3
  1/2" (cut 2) THE FRONT/BACK: is funny shaped. It's 3" wide and 4 1/4"
  tall (total height). From the bottom to the beginning of the "roof"
  section is 2 3/8". At 2 3/8" cut up to form the "roof" top like an
  upside down "V" (cut 2). Finally cut the ROOF: it's a rectangle 2
  3/4" x 4 1/4".
       Preheat oven to 350 degrees. On a flour-dusted cookie sheet or
  the back of one jelly roll pan, roll out one ball of dough to
  1/8"-1/4" thick. For each house cut one base, two sides, two
  front/back pieces, and two roof pieces.  Lay out the cardboard
  patterns on the dough, leaving 1 1/2" between them. The layout will
  depend on the size of your cookie sheet and how many houses you are
  making. Use a sharp knife to cut around each template, removing
  excess dough as you cut. Wipe the knife frequently. Repeat the
  rolling and cutting process to make the remaining pieces. If you want
  some small trees in front of your house, make them using a cookie
  cutter.
       Bake both sheets of cookies at the same time, for 10-15 minutes
  reemoving pieces when they are done (preferable to overbake than
  underbake since we need firm cookies). The cookies may brown, but
  this is O.K. Transfer immediately to a wire rack to cool completely.
       Decorate the pieces before assembling the houses. You can do
  this many ways. Mostly use your imagination. Frost or pipe/apply
  candies to the "wet" icing. To "sugar-coat" areas, brush on egg-wash
  (being careful not to touch any piping or decorations); then sprinkle
  immediately with colored sugar. Tap gently to shake off excess sugar.
  Set aside to dry for half an hour.
       Next to assemble houses. Use the #7 icing tip . Pipe a thick
  line of icing along edges to be put together and "glue" the houses
  together and on the base. Make sure to do one area at a time and hold
  until icing sets. Let all set for a few minutes.  When icing is firm,
  do any finishing touches. MAKES THREE COOKIE HOUSES WITH BASES The

  Potatoes are often the filler needed during Passover when bread is
  abolished for the holiday.  These small "footballs" of simple but
  satisfying ingredients can be served during a meal, although I have
  also served them with drinks as appetizers.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Diced Raw Potato
      2 ea Eggs, Beaten
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 x  Black Pepper To Taste
      1 tb Grated Yellow Onion
    1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
 
   Rather at the opposite end of the spectrum from crisp raw vegetables
  lies another kind of dipper.  One that at least began life in the
  vegetable kingdom ~-miniature potato pancakes. They're delicious and
  practical since they can be made weeks in advance and reheated.
   Place the potato in a strainer and run under cold water to remove the
  starch.  Shake well.  Place in a food processor or blender and chop
  fine. Add the eggs salt, pepper, and onion, blending well. In a
  10-inch skillet, heat vegetable oil until it crackles.  Drop the
  batter by Tablespoonful into the hot oil and fry until golden brown
  (about 5 minutes per side). Drain on paper towels.
   Once cooled, the pancakes may be frozen.  Place in a freezer-safe
  container making sure that they don't overlap and put a double
  thickness of wax paper between each layer. Reheat on a cookie sheet
  at 350 degrees F. until hot and crisp.
   Makes about 50 pancakes or enough for about 2 cups of dip.

  Bake the pumpkins (including the reserved lids), cut side down, on
  lightly oiled baking sheets in a preheated 350 degree oven for 40
  minutes or until they are tender. (Remove the lids after about 20
  minutes.) When they are cool enough to handle, scrape all the pulp
  out of the halved pumpkins. Scrape most of the pulp out of the
  remaining pumpkins, leaving just enough in each so that it retains
  its shape.
  
  In a skillet cook the onion in the butter over low heat, stirring,
  until it is softened. Add the sage and cook for 2 minutes. Add the
  pumpkin pulp and chicken stock and simmer for 20 minutes.
  
  Puree the mixture in batches in a blender and transfer it to a
  saucepan. Stir in salt and pepper to taste and water to thin the soup
  if necessary. Ladle about 1/2 cup of soup into each of 4 heated soup
  bowls and put one of the hollowed-out reheated  pumpkin shells on
  top. Fill each pumpkin shell with the soup and garnish with a
  sprinkling of the Parmesan and some of the parsley. Top with the
  reserved lids.

      Title: MINNIE & AUNT PETE'S YEAST ROLLS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
      6 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3 ts Salt
      2    Egg whites
      2 pk Yeast
  2 1/4 c  Warm water, 110 degrees
 
  Cut shortening into flour, salt and sugar. Dissolve yeast in warm
  water and add to flour mixture, then add egg whites. Mix together,
  knead until smooth and elastic (DON'T overknead and add only enough
  flour to keep dough from sticking) and let rise 1-1/2 hours, or until
  doubled in size.
  
  Punch dough down, roll out on a lightly floured surface, shape into
  rolls and place in greased muffin tins . Let rise until doubled in
  size and bake in a 375 degree oven 10 to 12 minutes or until brown.
  
  NOTE: these rolls can also be frozen on cookie sheets and placed in
  zip-loc freezer bags for up to 4 weeks after they have been shaped
  before the second rising. Take out of freezer at least 3 hours before
  baking, place in greased tin and let thaw and rise until doubled in
  size.
  
  Source: My beloved, albeit eccentric, grandmother and great aunt, who
  married and then built their houses side-by-side and remained culinary
  collaborators, to their family's benefit, all their lives. Deb's
  notes: these are an old family favorite and they're quite flexible.
  It's pretty hard to mess 'em up. They work as well for breakfast with
  jam or honey as they do with with dinner. Sometimes I substitute
  whole wheat flour for up to half the bread flour called for.
  
  I've successfully halved the recipe (3 cups bread flour, 1 pkg yeast
  or about 1-1/2 ts bulk) in my Hitachi ABM--BUT, BUT, BUT--I _don't_
  add the full amount of water at once. Rather, I start out with about
  7/8 cup and then dribble enough add'l water into the bread pan during
  the early stages of the knead cycle 'til the dough "looks right".

      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      1 c  Milk
     10 lg Mint Leaves, washed and
           -patted dry
      6    Egg Yolks
    3/4 c  Superfine Sugar
      2 tb Superfine Sugar
      8 oz Bittersweet Chocolate,
           -divided
      1 c  Unsalted Butter, room
           -temperature
  1 3/4 c  Unsweetened Cocoa
    3/4 c  Whipping Cream
    1/2 ts Mint Extract
           For the Creme Anglaise:
      4    Egg Yolks
      4 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      2 tb Creme de Cacao
    1/4 ts Vanilla
 
  For the Marquise:
  
  To prepare the marquise:  In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and
  mint leaves.  Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and set aside 15
  minutes.
  
  Whisk together the egg yolks and 3/4 cup sugar until foamy. Bring the
  milk back to a boil and strain into the egg mixture, whisking well.
  Pour back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring
  constantly, for five minutes.  Transfer to a bowl and cool slightly.
  Refrigerate until completely chilled. (This can be done 24 hours in
  advance and kept covered in refrigeration.)
  
  Chop 4 oz. of chocolate and place in the top of a double boiler. Melt
  over hot water; remove when chocolate is almost melted and stir until
  completely melted.  Cool the chocolate slightly.  Chop the remaining
  chocolate to make chips and set aside.
  
  With an electric mixer, beat together the butter and cocoa; scrape the
  sides of the bowl and the beater occasionally. Slowly beat in the cold
  custard sauce; the mixture will look curdled but will pull back
  together with beating. Beat in the cooled chocolate.
  
  Beat the whipping cream until foamy.  Beat in the remaining 2 Tbsp
  sugar and the mint extract; continue beating until soft peaks form.
  Fold 1/4 of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture to lighten
  the mixture; fold in the remaining whipped cream and the chocolate
  chips. Transfer to a 9x5-inch loaf pan that has been lined with two
  sheets of plastic wrap. Cover well and freeze.
  
  One hour before serving, remove the marquise from the pan by lifting
  out the plastic. Unmold onto a serving platter and refrigerate.
  
  Just before serving, prepare the creme anglaise: Whisk together the
  egg yolks and sugar until thickened and lightened in color. Bring the
  milk to a boil in a medium saucepan; whisk into the egg mixture. pour
  back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat until thickened,
  stirring constantly. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the creme de
  cacao and vanilla. Serve the sauce hot with the marquise.  Makes 16
  servings.
  
  Note:  The creme de cacao can be omitted from the sauce if desired.

      6 tb Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Water
           Juice of one large lemon
      1    Egg white
      4    Sprigs mint to decorate
 
  Wash the mint and shake it dry. Heat the sugar and water together
  until the sugar is melted.  Add the mint and leave it to steep in the
  sugar syrup off the heat for about twenty minutes to half an hour.
  Taste it to see if the mint taste has developed enough. If it's not
  strong enough you can reheat the mixture to the boil again and then
  let it stand for another ten minutes.
  
  When it tastes about right to you, strain the liquid into a rigid
  container and add the lemon juice.  Leave to cool, then freeze until
  it's semi-frozen (about 45 minutes to an hour). Beat the egg white
  until it's stiff enough to stand up in peaks (an electric whisk is
  good for this) and fold it gently into the semi-frozen mixture.
  Return to the freezer for about an hour. By this time it should have
  formed a fairly firm mush. Spoon it into glasses and decorate with
  the mint sprigs. You can vary this recipe by using grapefruit juice
  instead of lemon and using a bit less water and a bit less mint.

      Title: MINT WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
 Categories: Mousse
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 oz Chocolate, white
      3 tb Creme de menthe, green
      1 c  Cream, heavy
      2    Egg whites
           -(at room temperature)
 
  Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler.  When melted, stir in the
  creme de menthe. Let it cool a bit and stir in about 2 1/2 T of
  cream. Let cool.
  
  Beat the egg whites until stiff, but not dry.  Fold the
  chocolate-creme-cream mixture into the beaten egg whites. THE MORE
  CAREFULLY YOU FOLD, THE LIGHTER WILL BE THE MOUSSE.
  
  Whip the remaining cream, until soft peaks form.  Fold the egg
  whites-chocolate mixture into the whipped cream. AGAIN, THE MORE AIR
  YOU PRESERVE, THE LIGHTER THE MOUSSE. Spoon carefully into small
  bowls or cups and chill for about two hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sinful and light mint chocolate mousse -- This concoction is a
  variation of another white chocolate mousse, which is a variation of
  a dark rum chocolate mousse. It was invented for a friend's birthday,
  which happens to be on St. Patrick's Day. We were sitting around the
  day before, planning the celebration, and I offered to bring some
  white mousse. Someone suggested it should be green, in honor of the
  occasion. I came up with the perfect way to make green chocolate
  mousse....

 Categories: Fruits, Low-cal

      4    Apples, cored, peeled
    1/2 c  Water
      1 tb Dry mint (3 tb chopped fresh
      1 ts Ascorbic acid color keeper
 
  Serve with ham, lamb, gingerbread, muffins, pancakes.
  
  My note: Original directions called for apples to be chopped and
  cooked with cores and peels. After discarding what looked like a lot
  of applesauce stuck to the peel and picking bits of seeds out of my
  teeth, I would suggest cooking the peels and cores separately to get
  some apple juice.
  
  Cook apples with water, mint and color keeper (sold with canning
  supplies) in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil, simmer about 15 min. until
  apples are tender. Mash. Continue to simmer about 10 min until thick.
  Press through a sieve or use a blender if you have already separated
  the peel and cores.
  
  Ladle into hot clean jars leaving 1 cm headspace. Wipe jar rims.
  Process 10 min in boiling water bath. Store in a cool, dark, dry
  place.

      Title: MINTED PEA & NEW POTATO SALAD
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    350 g  Small new potatoes
           - scrubbed
      1 tb Wine vinegar
      2 tb Olive oil
    175 g  Frozen peas, lightly cooked
      5 tb Mayonnaise
      2 tb Finely chopped fresh mint
           Salt and pepper
 
  Serves 2-3
  
  A potato salad with a difference, this is a delightful summer dish.
  New potatoes are mixed with lightly cooked peas and some fresh mint,
  and lightly dressed with oil and vinegar. Lovely with a tossed salad
  and warm bread.
  
  Simmer the new potatoes for about 5 minutes, or until tender but
  still firm and crisp. Drain. While the potatoes are still warm,
  quarter them and halve the quarters. In a bowl drizzle the warm
  potatoes with the vinegar and the oil, season them with salt and
  pepper, and toss them carefully to coat them with the marinade.
  
  Let the potatoes marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 2 hours
  or overnight. Then add the peas, mayonnaise, mint, and salt and
  pepper to taste and stir the mixture carefully. Transfer the salad to
  a salad bowl and let it come to room temperature.

      1 lb Ground lamb
      1 sm Onion, coarsely grated
      1 ts Finely minced garlic
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh mint
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper

           -(for garnish)
 
  If you are tired of beef yet looking for a great-tasting burger,
  here's a splendid choice, easily mixed up with lots of fresh mint,
  onion and garlic. The fresh mint is essential for an exciting burst
  of flavor in these luscious patties. Chop the leaves coarsely with a
  good, sharp knife so that they will stay nice and green. For a
  garnish, nothing goes better than plain yogurt and ripe tomato
  slices. Drain the yogurt through a strainer lined with cheesecloth
  for one hour before serving.
  
  1. Prepare hot coals for grilling.
  
  2. Place the ground lamb in a bowl and mix well with onion, garlic and
  chopped mint, being sure not to overmix. Season to taste with salt and
  pepper. Gently form the mixture into 4 patties.
  
  3. Grill the burgers over hot coals, 3" from heat, for about 4
  minutes per side for rare meat or 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.
  
  4. Serve the lamb burgers immediately on buns topped with a tomato
  slice and a dollop of yogurt, if desired.
  
  Per serving (with tomato and yogurt garnishes): 363 calories, 18
  grams fat, 76 milligrams cholesterol.

      1 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Milk
           Pinch of salt
 
  Preheat oven 375 F. Melt the butter in a baking dish, allowing it to
  cover the bottom and grease sides of dis. Mix remaining ingredints.
  Batter will be thin. Pour into buttered dish, Over the batter spread
  4 cups canned or fresh fruit. Bake in a moderate oven (375) about 45
  minutes. The batter will rise through the fruit and form a brown
  crust.
  
  This recipe is vague on draining the fruit if canned, I would suggest
  doing so, since the same amount of fresh fruit can be used also (
  this contains no juice.)

      Title: MISHMASH (POTATO VEGETABLE PANCAKES) (OPT. OV
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Potatoes
      1 ea Carrots or other vegetables
      1 ea Matzo meal or bread crumbs
      1 ea Egg white or binder
 
  The technique of making potato cakes is a great one! I often steam
  potatoes along with carrots and turnips or rutabagas or winter
  squash, and then mash them all together with a little heated rice
  milk. We call it "mishmash." My mother made us this dish (with ground
  b**f) when we were convalescing, because it was easy to eat. It's
  great with ketchup. Leftovers make wonderful cakes, mixed with matzo
  meal or bread crumbs, and even egg white if you need a binder. It's
  also easy to reheat in the microwave.

      Title: MISO SOUP (BROWN)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  Water
      1    Inch piece of kombu, rinsed
      1    Handful of hijiki, wakame,
           Arame - your choice
      1    Tub of White Wave lowfat
           Tofu
      1    Onion coarsely chopped
      2    Carrots sliced
    1/8    To 1/4 cup miso paste (I
           Like the brown best)
 
  Rinse the kombu (kelp; you can get it in health food stores in the
  Macrobiotic section or in an Asian market) and put it in the water in
  a large pot.  Add the seaweed(s) of your choice. I always add wakame;
  hijiki tastes too strong for some people, but I love that too. Bring
  to a boil.
  
  While you're boiling the water, you can water, saute the onion, or
  just throw it into the water when it's almost at a boil. Turn the
  heat way down and add the carrots and the tofu.
  
  Put the miso into a bowl.  Pour some of the water from the pot over
  it (you kill some of the miso's good stuff if you boil it, so you
  shouldn't put it into the boiling water). Stir the miso thoroughly
  into the water and then add this back to the pot. Miso is really high
  in sodium, so you can adjust how much you add to taste. My
  macrobiotic cookbook says 1 tsp. per cup of water, but that tastes
  _really_ light to me.
  
  Remove the kombu piece (it's the tough one) and serve. I put brown
  rice in mine, since I don't like to eat brown rice plain.
  
  This soup has all kinds of items that the macrobiotic people say will
  cure you of cancer (thinking of an older digest question). Both miso
  and the seaweed are supposed to be excellent for your health
  according to Michio Kushi, et al.  YMMV.

  saucepan. Bring to a boil quickly and remove the nori.  Add the
  bonito to the still boiling broth, then remove from heat immediately
  and let stand about 2 minutes. Strain through a clean cloth and
  season with salt and soy sauce.
  
  Judi's Notes:
  
  1) Dashi is a fish stock that is light and clear used in Japanese
  cooking as a soup base.
  
  2) The recipe does not specify how much Nori (seaweed) to use. It
  states a quantity of 1.  Try using a 5-inch piece from a sheet of
  Nori and if that is weak put in more.

      Title: MISSOURI MIX
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 13 Servings
 
           Missouri mix and recipes
 
  Here is an all purpose baking mix that you can make up ahead of time
  and store in quantity. It is always ready for adaptation to a
  variety, of delicious, baked products. Mix saves time: The busy
  homemaker can combine the dry ingredients and fat at one time for
  seve to ten bakings. Few mixing utensils are needed for the recipes,
  so that clean up time is shortened too. Mix saves money: This mix
  made at home is one third cheaper per cup than a commercial mix. The
  saving is actually greater since the mix already contains the
  necessary milk as well as a higher percentage of fat. Because of the
  highter fat content the homemade mix usually gives a more tender
  product than most commercial mixes. Quick snacks: Quickly prepared
  warm after school snacks are possible with minimum effort. School
  children will want to make many of these recipes for themselves. Many
  of these quick recipes can be a special treat for unexpected company
  Variation of Liquids:Many of the folowing recipes call f! or fru it
  Juices as the liquid since the dry milk solids are incorporated in
  the mix. These fruit juices add variety as well as nutritive value.
  Using Mix with your own recipe: Should you have a special recipe that
  has not been adapted for use with the missouri mix, you may
  substitute 1 1/2 cups of the mix for each cup of flour called for in
  your recipe. The mix will contain the necessary baking powder, salt,
  fat and milk. Storage:Store in tightly covered container. Mixture may
  be measured into definite amounts, stored in plastic bags or jars and
  be ready for speedy mixing of your favorite recipe, missouri mix made
  with vegetable shortening may be stored at room remp for six weeks.
  Mix made with lard should be refrigerated. Using oil: Pat Dwigans

      Title: MIXED GRAIN MUSHROOM CASSEROLE
 Categories: Side dish, Main dish, Casseroles, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Wild rice
    1/2 c  Pearl barley
    1/2 c  Brown rice
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
      4    Garlic cloves; chopped
      4 tb Unsalted butter or margarine
           -OR- Oil
    1/2 lb Mushrooms; thickly sliced
  3 1/2 c  Broth
      1 ts Crushed dried thyme
    1/2 ts Crushed dried oregano
           Salt & pepper; to taste
 
  Combine grains in a mixing bowl and set aside. Pour the oil into a
  2-3 qt. casserole which is safe for both stovetop and oven cooking,
  and place on med. heat. When hot , saute onion and garlic until
  tender and translucent, about 5-6 mins. Add the mixed grains and
  saute for 1 min., stirring constantly.
  
  Meanwhile melt butter or margarine (if using) in a separate pan on
  med. high heat. When hot , add mushrooms and saute quickly, stirring
  frequently, until the shrooms are hot and have just absorbed the
  "butter" (about 1 min.). Immediately remove from heat.
  
  Add the broth, herbs, and mushrooms to the casserole with the onions
  and grains, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to
  taste, cover tightly (use aluminum foil between pot and cover if
  necessary for a good seal), and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hr.
  
  NOTES: I use alot less oil (only as much as needed to keep things from
  sticking in my cast-iron dutch oven), add hot peppers and fresh herbs
  (rosemary is especially delicious; i dislike dried oregano so i use
  less or none), add soy sauce instead of salt, and saute the mushrooms
  first in the same pan (taking them out when done) so i dont have to
  wash two pans :^>. Frankly i can't see where they get 8 servings
  from, this lasts me maybe 3 meals....It's really a hearty dish, so
  save it for a cold day (some of us still have a few left, despite the
  advent of spring). Enjoy!
  
  (8 servings as a side dish, less as an entree)

      2 ts Paprika
      2 ts Ground cumin
      1    Lemon; cut in wedges
 
  MAKE A MIXTURE OF GREENS TO SUIT your taste. Cut away the stems and
  stalks and wash the leaves. Set the greens in a steamer, with the
  tougher greens on the bottom. Cover and steam until tender, about 10
  minutes. Or, cook each type of green separately in boiling, salted
  water, until done. Let cool a few minutes in a colander, then squeeze
  out the extra liquid and chop roughly. Pound the garlic and 1/2
  teaspoon salt together in a mortar until finely broken down, then add
  the parsley and cilantro and continue working until you have a rough
  paste. Or, combine the garlic, salt and herbs in a food processor and
  work until everything is fine. You may need to add a little olive
  oil. Warm the olive oil with the paprika and cumin. When it begins to
  smell good, add the herb paste and mix the 2 together. Next add the
  greens and cook everything together for a minute or so until any
  excess moisture has evaporated. Taste and season with salt, if
  necessary. Pile into a serving dish and garnish with the wedges of
  lemon.

      2 ts Sugar
  2 1/2 ts Salt; or to taste
 
  *  This is also known as rice sticks and is available in Chinese
  groceries. ** A very delicate spice sold in powder form. Also known
  as kha in Thai cooking. Available in Asian groceries. ***A hard nut
  with lots of oil used to flavor curries.  Also known as kemiri
  (Indonesian) or buah keras (Malay). Available in Asian groceries.
  
  Shell and devein prawns, reserving shells and heads. Drain these
  thoroughly.  Remove any bones and skin from fish fillets and using a
  chopper, chop very finely. Mix in the salt and pepper and shape into
  small balls, or into a sausage-shaped roll and divide into
  finger-width slices. Pick over crab meat and discard any bony tissue,
  or chop the whole crabs into pieces after removing top shell and
  fibrous tissue.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a saucepan and when very hot throw in the
  prawn heads and shells and fry until they turn bright red. Add 8 cups
  water and 2 teaspoons salt, cover and simmer 20-30 minutes, then
  strain. Discard shells and heads.  Return the stock to the fire, drop
  in the fish balls or slices and the prawns, cut into pieces if large.
  Return to the boil, then lower heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes.  Set
  aside and keep warm.
  
  Scald the rice vermicelli by pouring boiling water over it, then
  allow it to drain in a colander.  Or soak it in warm water for 5-10
  minutes, drain well. Scald the bean sprouts by pouring boiling water
  over. Rinse in cold water, washing off any loose skins. Pinch off
  straggly brown "tails." Slice spring onions finely, roughly chop mint
  leaves. Set aside each ingredient separately] until serving time.
  
  TO MAKE THE SOUP:  Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil and fry the
  onions, garlic, and lemon rind until onions are golden. Stir in the
  laos powder, candlenuts, chillies, blacan, turmeric and coriander.
  Add the prawn stock and when the soup comes to the boil add the
  coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for
  10-15 minutes, stirring to prevent coconut milk curdling.
  
  In each bowl, arrange a ladle of the vermicelli, enough to two-thirds
  fill the bowl.  Add a handful of bean sprouts, a tablespoon each of
  cucumber, and sliced spring onions. Add also a large pinch of mint.
  Pour the boiling soup over and serve immediately.  A hot sambal can
  be served along with this for individuals to add to their portion if
  desired. Serves 8-10. Source:  The Complete Asian Cookbook.

      Title: MIXED SPICE RELISH (SAMBAL BAJAK)
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
     10    Red chillis
      1 sl Terasi
     10    Shallots
      5    Cloves garlic
      3    Kemiri (candlenuts)
      3 tb Vegetable oil
           Salt
      1 ts Brown sugar
      1 c  Thick santen (coconut milk)
 
  This is a hot relish, and to make it all the ingredients have to be
  pounded together. If you do this in a mortar, try to keep the mixture
  off your fingers as much as possible if you have sensitive skin; it
  is not only your tongue that can feel the effects of a strong chilli.
  Sambal Bajak will keep for a long time in an air tight jar, and lose
  none of its fierceness.
  
  Take the first five ingredients above-that is, the chillis, terasi,
  shallots, garlic, and kemiri-and pound them all together into a fine
  paste. Alternatively, mince them first as fine as you can and then
  put them in a liquidizer. Saute them in the vegetable oil for a few
  minutes, then add the salt, sugar and santen. Simmer gently for 20
  minutes, and finish by cooking on a high flame, stirring
  continuously, for 1 minute.
  
  Let the sambal cool before you store it. It can be served hot or
  cold, and can be reheated many times without impairing the flavour.
  If you have used a mincer and liquidizer during the preparation, wash
  them several times in hot water and with plenty of detergent before
  you use them for anything else.

  Here is a suggested medley of vegetables, but improvise and use
  whatever is in season and reasonably young and tender. Very firm
  vegetales will grill more quickly and evenly if you first cook them
  in boiling water until just tender, a step that can be done hours
  ahead.
  
  In a small bowl whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, cilantro,
  salt and pepper, set aside.
  
  In a large pot bring about 4 quarts salted water to a rapid boil.
  Cook the fennel bulbs until just tender when pierced, 7-10 minutes.
  Remove them and drain well; set aside. Drop in the artichokes and
  cook until just tender, 5-10 minutes.  Scoop them out, drain well and
  then cut them in half lengthwise; set aside. Blanch the garlic heads
  for about 5 minutes; remove them, drain well and set aside.  Finally,
  blanch the Belgian endives for about 1 minute; remove them, drain
  well and then cut in half lengthwise. Set aside. Have th chili
  peppers, mushrooms, asparagus and onion at hand also.
  
  Prepare a fire in a grill.  Position the oiled grill rack 4-6 inches
  above the fire.  Arrange the vegetables on the rack. Grill the fennel
  halves, artichoke halves, whole garlic heads and onion slices for
  about 12 minutes, the pepper halves and mushrooms for about 10
  minutes, the endive halves for about 8 minutes, and the asparagus for
  4-8 minutes, depending upon size. As the vegetables cook, turn them
  two or three times and brush with the oil mixture.  Serve warm or at
  room temperature.

  dressing until it thickens. Put it into a jar and leave it to stand
  overnight for the flavours to amalgamate. Strain the dressing into a
  jug, and stir in the chives, dill and parsley.
  
  Arrange the shredded cabbage in the centre of a serving-platter and
  toss it in half of the dressing. Arrange the French beans, artichokes
  and corn decoratively around the cabbage. Serve the remaining
  dressing in a sauce boat.

      Title: MIXED VEGETABLE SALAD WITH PEANUT SAUCE (GADO
 Categories: Indonesian, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Package firm
           -(Chinese-style) tofu
      1 ts Kecap manis
           Oil, for deep frying
      6 c  Vegetables *
           Hard-cooked eggs, for
           -garnish
           Fried Onion Flakes for
           -garnish

MMMMM----------------------GADO-GADO SAUCE---------------------------
      1 tb Minced garlic
      2 tb Minced shallot
      1 tb Minced fresh galangal or
      1 ts Ground galangal
      1 ts Dried shrimp paste
    1/2 ts Ground dried chile or
    1/4 ts Sambal ulek
      1 c  Oil
    1/2 c  Raw peanuts
      1 ts Brown or palm sugar
      1 c  Thin coconut milk **
           Salt, to taste
           Juice of 1/2 lime, to
           -taste
 
  * (a variety of the following):  cabbage, in 1-inch squares; bean
  sprouts; carrots, sliced or julienned; green beans, in 2-inch pieces;
  potatoes or sweet potatoes in large dice; sliced cucumbers;
  watercress sprigs; tomato wedges.
  
  ** (The thin stuff from the bottom of a can of coconut milk. SC)
  
  This is from a new cookbook I just got.  Haven't tried this recipe
  yet, but it looks dead on.
  
  This is a rather free-form salad of lightly cooked vegetables; the
  exact contents depend on what is available. What makes it gado-gado
  is the dressing, a creamy peanut sauce.
  
  1.  Remove tofu from package and drain.  Place on a plate lined with
  cloth or paper towels, top with another layer of towel and an
  inverted plate, and place a weight of a pound or more on top.  Let
  stand for 30 minutes, unwrap, and discard liquid.  Cut tofu into
  bite-sized squares or triangles and sprinkle with kecap manis. Fry in
  350F oil until golden brown and puffy; transfer to paper towels to
  drain.  Reserve oil to cook peanuts.
  
  2.  One at a time, blanch vegetables in lightly salted water, rinsing
  them in cold water to stop cooking as soon as they reach the desired
  degree of doneness. Cabbage and bean sprouts require only a few
  seconds; carrots, green beans, and potatoes may take several minutes
  depending on size and tenderness.  Do not blanch cucumbers,
  watercress, and tomatoes. use them raw.
  
  3.  Place Gado-Gado Sauce in a small bowl in the center of a large
  platter. Arrange vegetables on platter around sauce. Garnish with
  wedges or slices of hard-cooked egg and fried onion flakes.  To
  serve, spoon some sauce onto each plate and dip vegetables into
  sauce. Serves 4 to 6 with other dishes.
  
  GADO-GADO SAUCE:
  
  1.  To prepare sauce in a mortar:  Pound garlic, shallot, galangal,
  shrimp paste, and chile to a paste. To prepare sauce in a blender:
  Chop together in a 1-cup jar.
  
  2.  In a wok or deep skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until a
  peanut sizzles on contact. Fry peanuts until lightly browned;
  transfer to paper towels to drain.  When peanuts have cooled, grind
  in a mortar or food processor to a coarse, grainy paste, adding a
  little oil if necessary to facilitate blending. (May be made up to a
  week ahead and stored covered in refrigerator.)
  
  3.  Remove all but 2 tablespoons oil from pan and reserve for another
  use. Return pan to medium-low heat and add pounded mixture. Cook
  until quite fragrant, but do not burn. Add peanuts, sugar, and
  coconut milk and bring to a boil, stirring.  Simmer until thick and
  season to taste with salt and lime juice.  Allow to coot to room
  temperature before serving.
  
  Makes 1 cup.

 Categories: Party
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -Dorothy Cross TMPJ72B
    1/4 c  Honey; preferable berry-
           -blossom honey
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
      2    Large sprigs fresh mint
      6    Smaller sprigs for garnish
  2 1/2 pt Mixed fresh berries; such
           -as red or golden
           -raspberries, blueberries,
           -tiny strawberries,
           -blackberries, pitted Bing
           -or Queen Anne cherries
      2 c  Chilled Champagne; or other
           -sparkling white wine
 
  In a small saucepan, combine the honey, lime juice and large mint
  sprigs; warm over low heat just until the honey melts. Remove from
  the heat and let steep for 5 minutes; discard the mint. Place the
  fruit in a large bowl, pour the honey mixture over and stir gently to
  combine. Divide the berry mixture among 6 individual goblets or
  dessert dishes and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 1 hour.
  Just before serving, pour the Champagne over the fruit. Garnish each
  serving with a sprig of mint and serve. Serves 6.
  
  COMMENTS: Nonalcoholic champagne, such as Ariel Brut, can be
  substituted for the real thing. Any combination of berries or
  cherries (or nectarines or peaches, for that matter) can be used.
  Several colors make the prettiest presentation, but single-berry
  ambrosia is delicious too.

      Title: MJADDRA (LENTILS WITH RICE)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Lentils
    3/4 c  Uncooked rice
      2 md Onions; chopped
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Allspice or bhar
 
  Clean and wash the lentils and boil them until tender. Mash and
  strain into a separate pot.  Add the rice, salt, and spices, and mix
  well. In a pan, saute the chopped onions in oil until golden. Add
  them with the frying oil to the lentils and rice.  Bring the mixture
  to the boil with enough water to cover and simmer over low heat for
  about 10 minutes, until the rice is cooked, stirring regularly to
  prevent sticking.  Serve lukewarm or cold with radishes and spring
  onions or a cabbage salad.
  
  That's the recipe straight from the book.  I make a couple changes:
  first of all, I'm a bit liberal with the cumin and allspice - I don't
  use measuring spoons, and I'm sure I get more than the 1/4 or 1/2
  teaspoon. Bhar, btw, is described by the book as "a spice blend made
  of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg.  It is very similar in flavor to
  allspice, which may be substituted for it." I use brown basmati rice,
  so I have to boil it for more than 10 minutes; this means I have to
  keep adding water to it so it doesn't dry out.
  
  I mean to go back to the restaurant I first had this dish at and ask
  them what spices they use, since theirs is both spicier and darker
  than mine.

      Title: MO'S ANCESTRAL EGGNOG
 Categories: Drinks, Holiday
      Yield: 16 Cups
 
     12    Eggs, separated
      1 lb Confectioner's sugar
      2 c  Liquor
      8 c  Whipping cream, heavy
      2 ts Nutmeg (or less)
    1/2 c  Sugar
 
  Separate the 12 eggs.  Set the whites aside in the 'fridge, tightly
  covered for safety, as they won't be needed until much later. Beat
  the yolks until they noticeably lighten in color. From here on out,
  an industrial-strength mixer (Kitchen-Aid K5, for instance) is a big
  help.
  
  Continue beating the yolks while adding the confectioner's sugar.
  Beat for about 4 minutes or until the mixture turns much lighter
  yellow and takes on a satin-like texture. While still beating, slowly
  add about 2 cups liquor. [If you decide you need more, this is NOT
  where you put it in.]
  
  After the liquor is thoroughly beaten in, cover the mixture with
  plastic wrap or aluminum foil and let it stand for 1 hour at room
  temperature. This is to cook the eggs and takes much longer if you
  refrigerate. [I lay plastic wrap right down on top of the mixture to
  avoid any possible skin that might form.]
  
  After standing, add the heavy whipping cream, unwhipped! You could try
  whipping it first, but again, you are on your own. Add the nutmeg.
  OPTION: At this point, the original recipe calls for adding an
  additional 2-4 cups of liquor, but I omitted this as it passed a
  taste-test as-is. If you want your 'Nog a LOT stronger, have at it,
  but please taste before you pour.
  
  Mix thoroughly, again.  Refrigerate the mixture for 3 hours to let it
  ripen. I use two large juice containers. It splits nicely between
  them and will fit in our 'fridge. [Overnight is good, if you're
  making it for, say, Christmas day, but see the safety note below if
  you intend to let it sit overnight.]
  
  At the end of the 3 hours, remember where you put the egg whites.
  Beat them until stiff but not dry, adding about 1/2 cup sugar to
  slightly sweeten the whites. N.B.: 12 egg whites whip into quite a
  mass, so be prepared. [You can also whip them 6 at a time. This is
  probably a very good idea if you're doing it in a Kitchen Aid, since
  12 might overflow the bowl.]
  
  Pour the whites into the serving bowl you will be using. Then gently
  and slowly pour the other mixture into the bowl, mixing with a whisk
  to fold it all together. The whites should be smoothly and evenly
  distributed through the 'Nog to make it fluffy. They will lose some
  of their bulk so don't be afraid to mix thoroughly. Sprinkle the top
  with some more nutmeg, and serve. A shaker of nutmeg by the bowl is a
  nice touch for those wanting a shake on their own mugful. [The first
  time I made this recipe, I had to keep re-stirring the mixture. The
  only difference I can think of is that the second time I didn't add
  sugar to the egg whites.]
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Wonderful Eggnog -- I got this recipe from net.cooks back in 1982.
  It was posted by Mike O'Dell (known around the network as mo). I have
  made it for the last two Christmases, and find it quite good. The
  recipe is basically as he posted it. I have added a few comments in
  brackets. Apparently he served it at a party at LBL-CSAM that year.
  
  This wonderful formula was handed down to me from my grandmother, who
  got it from her mother and grandmother. I heartily recommend it as a
  superior lubricant for the festive season.  Yield:  Makes about
       16    cups.
  
  *  [This makes a large amount of eggnog.  Last year I made a half
  recipe, which sufficed for the 10 or so people we had then. This year
  I made the whole thing, and 16 people left some over (some of them
  don't drink, though).]
  
  Powered sugar will do nicely, and even granulated would probably work
  if you beat long enough.
  
  *  For the liquor, use bourbon, rum, vodka, Canadian blended, or
  whatever you like. Being a bourbon fan, I used that in the batch for
  the CSAM party. The others should work but I haven't tried them.
  Depending on taste, you may want more than this. [I used rum the
  times I made it.] Enjoy!!!
  
  Difficulty:  moderate;  Time:  1/2 hour preparation, 3 hours waiting;
  Precision:  no need to measure.
