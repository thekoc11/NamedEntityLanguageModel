minutes or until bacon is crisp and scallops are done, basting
occasionally with reserved marinade (cooking time will vary greatly

low fat, seafood

1 large egg white
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 teaspoon reduced sodium soy sauce
1/2 cup unseasoned dry breadcrumbs; (fine)
2 teaspoon sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 1/4 lb sea scallops; sliced in half horizontal
      ----DIPPING SAUCE----
2 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoon rice-wine vinegar
1 tablespoon scallions; chopped
1 teaspoon honey

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Lightly oil a wire rack large enough

soy sauce until creamy.  In a shallow dish, stir together
breadcrumbs, sesame seeds, and ginger.

batches, tossing each with a spoon to coat evenly. Place the scallops
on the prepared rack; they should not touch each other. Bake for 8-10
minutes or until the outsides are golden and the centers are opaque.

To Make Dipping Sauce:  In a small bowl, stir together the sauce
ingredients.  Serve alongside the hot scallops. Serves 4

Diet Shrimp Bisque

soups, low cal, seafood

2 lb fresh shrimp; -=or=- scampi, lobster or
1 tablespoon safflower; -=or=- virgin olive oil
1  leek  cleaned & sliced coarsely
1 small carrot; peeled and sliced
1  celery stalk; sliced
2  shallots; peeled and chopped
1  garlic clove  peeled & minced
1 tablespoon tomato puree
1 1/2 cup dry white wine
2 quart water
1  chicken bouillon cube  crushed
1 pinch saffron
      ----HERB BOUQUET----
1/2 teaspoon thyme; and
1/2  bay leaf, and
6  fresh parsley stems (tied in cheese; cloth)
      ----FOR THE BISQUE----
1  salt and pepper to taste
4 tablespoon cornstarch
4 tablespoon non-fat powdered milk
1/2 teaspoon cognac, armagnac or brandy
4  basil leaves; minced
1 teaspoon tarragon, minced
1 tablespoon minced chives

SEPARATE THE TAIL from the shrimp and remove the meat, reserving all
shells, claws, heads and so forth. If you wish, devein the tails, then
cover and refrigerate. Coarsely chop the heads and shells, reserving 4
heads for decoration, if you have them. In a large saucepan, heat the
oil over moderate heat, then add the shrimp shells and cook them.
Stir slowly but continuously for 5 minutes. Add the vegetables and
tomato puree and cook another 5 minutes, stirring. Add the wine and
bring to the boil for 30 seconds, scraping the bottom to dissolve any
coagulated juices. Add the water, bouillon cube, saffron and herb
bouquet. Return to a simmer and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Pour the
stock through a fine strainer into a bowl, pressing down on the
vegetables and shrimp shells with a soup ladle to extract all of the
liquid. (For a finer result, strain again through cheesecloth.)
Return the stock to the boil. Moisten the cornstarch in a little cold
water, then add it to the saucepan and boil for 4 minutes. Taste for
salt and pepper. (The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point and
refrigerated.) Bring the stock to a simmer. Add the shrimp tails and
let them cook a bare 2 minutes (for small or medium), or 3 minutes
for extra large. Remove immediately with a slotted spoon and divide
them among 4 heated soup plates. Pour the stock into a blender, add
the powdered milk and cognac. Blend until smooth and homogeneous.
Pour immediately into the soup plates over the shrimp tails. Garnish
each dish with an equal amount of the herbs and a shrimp head
(optional). This rich-tasting bisque has only 90 calories per serving.

TIME ESTIMATE: Hands on, 45 minutes COST ESTIMATE: Low

Without a doubt, this is England's most famous dish. Always deep
fried, the fish is mostly cod, and the batter made with eggs, milk
and flour.Liberally salted, the fish and chips are traditionally
doused with malt vinegar and wrapped in newspaper, so that everything
goes limp. My recipe is designed not to flaunt tradition, but to make
the taste available to those who count fat grams for good reason. My
method delivers this "grease heaven" for a mere 13 grams of fat per
serving...or 23 percents calories from fat. The peas are definitely
not "classic" -t hey simply don't behave well in a newspaper...but
then who does?

Helpful Hints BIG CHIPS. The bigger the better! We experimented for
some time with the idea that the larger the french fry the lower its
fat content would be. It's simply a matter of exposed surface area.
By cutting a large russet potato lengthwise into three slices both
ways, you'll get nine potato sticks between 1/2" and 3/4". When they
are cooked, you'll experience a completely new and fabulous taste -
potato, almost free of grease. DIRECTIONS: THE CHIPS: Preheat the
oven to 500F. In a large frying pan, heat the oil and fry the potato
sticks until brown on all sides - about 13 minutes. Transfer the
potatoes to a roaster pan and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven
and sprinkle with the salt. THE FISH: In a small bowl, combine the
cornmeal, bread crumbs, cayenne, salt, parsley and dill. Spread the
mixture out on a large plate. Pour the milk, flour and oil out, each
onto its own large plate. Set all 4 plates side by side.
Dip the fillets first into the milk and then into the flour, turning
until completely covered. Next dip the fish back into the milk, then
into the bread crumb mixture and through the oil. Place the breaded
cod on a baking sheet and bake for 8 minutes (you can time the fish
to cook for the last 8 minutes with the chips.) THE PEAS: In a medium
saucepan, bring the water to a boil and simmer the peas, salt, mint
and sugar until the peas are tender - about 3 minutes. TO SERVE:
Divide the fish and chips among 4 dinner plates. I serve this classic
with a "handy" wedge of lemon (easy to squeeze), peas and watercress.
It's the combination of golden browns and vivid greens and lemon
yellow that makes such a great picture.

Grilled Salmon With Potato & Watercress Salad

fish, salads, low fat, grill

3 lb small red thin-skinned
1  potatoes
1 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1  about 1/2 pound watercress
1  rinsed and crisped
1  salmon fillet, about 2 lbs.
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon firmly packed brown sugar
2 cup alder or mesquite wood chips
1  soaked in water
1  salt

In a 5-to 6-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high
heat; add potatoes.  Cover and simmer over low heat until potatoes
are tender when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and chill.

Soak the onions about 15 minutes in cold water to cover. Drain and mix
onions with rice vinegar.  Cut potatoes in quarters; add to onions.

Trim tender watercress sprigs from stems, then finely chop enough of
the course stems to make 1/2 cup (discard extras or save for other
uses). Mix chopped stems on a large oval platter with potato salad
alongside; cover and keep cool.

Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Place, skin side down, on a piece of heavy
foil. Cut foil to follow outlines of fish, leaving a 1-inch border.
Crimp edges of foil to fit up against edge of fish. Mix soy sauce
with brown sugar and brush onto the salmon fillet.

Lay fish on center of grill, not over coals or flame. Cover barbecue
(open vents for charcoal) and cook until fish is barely opaque in
thickest part (cut to test), 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer fish to
platter with salad. Add salt to taste.  Serve hot or cold.

Lime-Ginger Smoked Salmon

seafood, bbq, low-fat/cal, diabetic, smoker

3 lb whole salmon
1  lime; juiced
1 tablespoon grated lime peel
1 tablespoon fresh ginger and
1 teaspoon powdered ginger
3  handfuls dried apple or
1  maple twigs
12 oz apple juice
1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger or
3 slice fresh ginger
3 cup cooked brown rice or
1  couscous

Clean salmon; discard head.  Peel ginger and slice very thin. Wash
and pat salmon dry.  Rub salmon with lime juice. Put ginger slices
and lime peel inside cavity of fish. Sprinkle powdered ginger over
exterior of fish. cover fish lightly with plastic wrap and
refrigerate 2 hours.
Soak twigs 30 in water 30 minutes; drain.
Prepare smoker according to manufacturer's directions. Fill fire pan
about three-quarters full of hardwood charcoal and heat coals. Arrange
twigs over hot coals. Fill water pan about three-quarters full with
hot water.  Add apple juice and ginger to water pan and place pan in
smoker as aromatic.
Unwrap salmon and place on sprayed grid.  cover quickly. smoke
salmon about 3 hours or until fish flakes easily when prodded with
fork. Skin will turn a smoky color.
While smoking, remember not to remove lid of smoker more than is
necessary because it allows heat and moisture to escape, which slows
the smoking process. also, while using smoker, check every 30 minutes
to see if hot water or coals have to be replenished. Be careful and
use pot holders.
Serve fish warm or cold with hot rice.

NOTE:  A perfect way to store fresh ginger is to peel it, place it in
a small jar, cover it with sherry, and refrigerate. The sherry adds
flavor and body to the taste of the ginger.

Poached Orange Roughy With Hot Tomato Orange

fish, low cal, low fat

1 1/2 lb fresh tomatoes (about 3 med)
3 tablespoon white onion; grated
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup orange marmalade
2 tablespoon brandy
2 teaspoon whole coriander; crushed
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch cayenne
1 1/4 lb orange roughy fillets
1  lemon wedges (1 per serving)

Cut the unpeeled tomatoes in half crosswise, squeeze out the seed
pockets, and cut out the stem ends.  Dice the tomatoes and place in a
saucepan with the onion and salt. Cook over medium heat, 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally.  Add the marmalade and brandy and continue to
cook, 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the coriander, cinnamon,
and cayenne and cook 5 minutes longer, stirring frequently.

Meanwhile, rinse the fish.  Place it in a skillet large enough to
hold it in a single layer and add enough water to just cover the
fish. Remove the fish and set aside. Bring the water to a boil over
high heat, reduce heat to medium, and add the fish in a single layer.
Bring back to a simmer, cover, and poach 3 to 5 minutes, depending on
the thickness of the fish. Fish is done when mostly opaque but still
barely translucent at the very center.  Remove from the poaching
liquid, draining off as much water as possible.  Place on a platter
and drain again.  Pour the hot tomato orange marmalade over the fish,
garnish with lemon wedges, and serve immediately.

Spicy Stir-Fry Shrimp - Friday's Dinner Menu

main dish, low cal, low fat

1  onion
4 cup snow peas, trimmed
1/2 lb vermicelli noodles
2 teaspoon vegetable oil
3  garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoon gingerroot, minced
1 lb large shrimp, peel/devein
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 dash hot pepper sauce
2 tablespoon unsalted roast peanuts, chopped

Serve with: Green Salad with Low-fat Ranch Dressing Crispy Bread
Sticks Pears with Cheddar cheese Gingersnap cookies

A stir-fry with shrimp, vegetables and noodles that make a great
one-dish meal. When using a nonstick skillet to stir-fry, you need
only a tiny amount of oil. For dessert, cheese and pears round out
the four food groups in this meal. Gingersnap cookies are a good
choice since they satisfy a sweet craving but are lower in fat than
most types of cookie.

Sweet and spicy shrimp make an easy, impressive dinner. If you
prefer, you can use wide noodles.

Cut onion in half lengthwise; slice lengthwise into thin strips. Cut
snow peas in half diagonally; set aside.

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles for 7 minutes or
until tender but firm; drain.

Meanwhile, in nonstick wok or large skillet, heat oil over medium-high
heat; cook onion, garlic and ginger, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add
shrimp and snow peas; cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

In bowl, whisk together stock, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar,
cornstarch and hot pepper sauce; stir into shrimp mixture. Increase
heat to high; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until shrimp are firm
and pink and sauce is thickened.

Toss noodles with shrimp mixture. Sprinkle with peanuts.
