Pan Haggis

pork, ethnic, lamb

1 pound pig's or lamb's liver
3  onions
5 ounce minced suet
1/2  pt. water
3 ounce pinhead oatmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Simmer liver and onions in stock for 30-40 minutes. Put oatmeal in a
heavy pan over heat or under the grill, and toast until nicely
browned. When the meat is cooked, remove from pan, keeping liquid.
Mince liver and onions, add oatmeal, suet, salt and pepper. Moisten
with sufficient liquid to give a softish consistency, put in a
greased pudding basin and cover with a double lid of foil, and steam
for 3 hours.

Now, you probably don't have a pudding basin (I'm not sure what one
is).

From "The Highlander's Cookbook," by Sheila MacNiven Cameron, here is
an alternate method:

Turn into a greased Pyrex bowl. Cover with two or three layers of
foil. Steam on a rack in a pan of boiling water for two hours, adding
more boiling water as it boils away.

Panfried Quail

poultry, game

1 cup white grapes (to make 1/4 to 1/3 cu; p grape juice)
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
8 quart split and flattened
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
1/2 cup virginia ham, cut into 2 by 1/4 inc; h matchsticks

First, make the fresh white grape juice.  Crush the cup of grapes in a
pestle, then put through a sieve or vegetable mill to extract the
juice, or use a potato ricer. Combine the salt, pepper, and thyme,
crushing the thyme with your fingertips.  Sprinkle both sides of the
birds with the seasonings. Melt the butter in a large skillet over
medium heat until it foams and just begins to brown. Add the quail,
skin-side down. Sprinkle with ham, cover and cook for 3 to 4 minutes,
until the skin is golden brown. Turn the birds and continue cooking,
covered, until the juices run clear, about 4 minutes longer. Take the
pan from the heat and let the quail rest, covered, for about 10
minutes. Arrange the quail on a platter and sprinkle the ham from the
pan over them. Pour the fat from the pan. Add the grape juice (you
can also use water, if you prefer), and bring to a boil. Cook for 1
minute, scraping the browned bits from the bottom to deglaze the pan.
Pour over the quail and serve.

Pate De Campagne (Country Pork Pate)

pork

1 tablespoon butter
1  onion; chopped
1/2 pound ground lean pork
1/2 pound ground pork fat
1/2 pound ground veal
1/2 pound pork or chicken liver, finel y chop; ped
2  cloves garlic, peeled
1  pinch of ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1  pinch of ground nutmeg
2  eggs; beaten to mix
2 tablespoon brandy
1  salt
1  pepper
1/2 pound bacon slices

Melt butter in a small saute pan and cook onion over low heat until
soft but not brown, 10-15 minutes. Leave to cool. In a food
processor, puree the pork, pork fat, veal, pork or chicken liver,
garlic, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, eggs,  cooked onion, brandy, salt
and pepper. Divide the mixture in half if it does not all fit
comfortably in the machine. Saute a small piece of mixture and taste
for seasoning. It should be highly seasoned. If not, add more salt
and pepper. Set oven at 350F. Line the sides and base of a 1-quart
terrine mold with bacon, reserving 2 slices. Pack pork mixture in the
mold and smooth the top. Cut remaining bacon in thin strips and
arrange in a lattice on top of the pate. Cook the pate, uncovered,
ion a water bath until done when  tested with a skewer, 1.1/4 to
1.1/2 hours. Let pate cool to  tepid.  Insert a board that fits
inside the rim of the terrine. Distribute weights on top and chill.
Serve pate from the mold, and cut in slices at the table. The pate
should be made at least 48 hours ahead so that the  flavours mellow.
It can be kept up to 5 days in the refrigerator. Variations:  Pate de
porc solgnote (Pork pate with Hazelnuts) Add 1 cup toasted peeled
hazelnuts to the pork mixture. Pate de Pork Marbree (Marbled Pork
Pate)  Roll each chicken liver in very thinly sliced pork fat or fat
bacon. Make pate mixture without livers. Pack half of the mixture
into the mold and place livers down the center. Cover with remaining
mixture and bake. When sliced, the pate is marbled with liver
outlined in fat. Source: Classic French Cooking

Peachy Mustard Baby Back Ribs

pork

3 tablespoon peach preserves
3 tablespoon peanut oil
3 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1  salt and pepper to taste
2  racks baby back ribs, about 2 pound; s, each

Baby back ribs are cut from the back rib section of the pig, and the
meat on them is as tender as a center-cut pork chop. For that reason,
they can be grilled fairly quickly without any precooking.

Mix mustard with the peach preserves, peanut oil, lemon juice,
garlic, salt and pepper.  Marinate the ribs in this mixture for at
least 30 minutes.

Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are white hot, or preheat a gas
grill on high for 5 minutes with the lid closed.

Grill the ribs about 4 inches from the hot coals. They will take
about 6 minutes per side.  Be careful, this sweet sauce burns easily.

Serves 4.

Pecan-Coated Roast Pork Loin With Baked Peach

meats, pork, holidays, kwanzaa

4 pound boneless loin of pork
1/4 cup olive oil
2 teaspoon powered sage
1 teaspoon garlic; minced
1  salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoon dark brown sugar; packed
1/4 pound peacan halves; finely chop
8  canned, freestone peach halves
1  freshly ground nutmeg

Rub the pork throughly with olive oil.  Combine the sage, thyme,
garlic, salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar in a food
processor or blender and pulse until you have a thick paste. (You may
have to add a drizzle of olive oil to get it started). Slather the
paste over the pork loin, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate it
overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Roll the pork loin in the
chopped pecans and place it in a roasting pan.  Make a tent of
aluminum foil and arrange it over the pork loin, covering the nuts
completely so that they won't char. Roast for 30 minutes; then lower
the heat to 350 degrees. After 30 more minutes, place the peach
halves around it in the bottom of the roasting pan. Sprinkle with
remaining brown sugar and a grinding of nutmeg. After 20 more
minutes, remove foil and continue to roast until the pork is done,
about 20 minutes more.

Pepperoni Sticks - Italian Style

pork, italian, beef

3 1/2 pound salt
5 ounce sugar
4 ounce cure
2 ounce ground hot red pepper
2 ounce allspice
5 ounce ground anise seed
10 pound ice water

Ingredients for 100 pounds.

Meat in Pounds Boneless cowmeat 50 pounds, Beef cheeks 20 pounds, Beef
flanks or plates 30 pounds.

Grinding and Mixing: Grind all the meats thru a 3/16" grinder plate.
Remove to mixer and add all the ingredients mixing evenly, regrind
thru 1/8" grinder plate. The meat is now ready for stuffing. Stuffing:

It is essential that the meat is well chilled to avoid smearing the
meat. The meat should be stuffed into 24 to 26 mm lamb casings.
Smoking:

Preheat smokehouse to 125 degrees F and place pepperoni in smoker.
Have dampers wide open without smoke until the casings are dry. Close
the dampers 1/4 open and apply a heavy smoke raising the temperature
to 140 degrees.  Hold this temperature until the internal temperature
of the product reaches 130 degrees. When using PORK, raise the
temperature to 150 degrees and hold until the internal temperatue
reaches 138 degrees. Remove from the smokehouse and chill with cold
tap water until the internal temperature is reduced 105 degrees to
110 degrees. Return to the cold smokehouse at 110 degrees and apply a
heavy smoke for at least 12 hours or overnight. Leave dampers 1/4
open.

Drying: The drying room should be kept at 60 degrees to 65 degrees
and a relative humidity of 70%.  The drying time will vary because of
the amount of moisture that has been removed from the sausage during
smoking. It usually takes 3 to 4 days to make a satisfactory
pepperoni. When fully dry, the pepperoni will yield from 50 to 55% of
the original product.

Alternate Drying Method without smoking: Hold pepperoni at 70 degrees
for about 2 days maintaining a relative humidity of about 75%. The
product should be kept in a cooler for at least 20 days from the time
the cure had been added to the pepperoni.  Be sure that casins used
are not over 1-3/8" in diameter as this formula applies only to
casings below this range.

Peppery Hamburgers W/Red Wine Sauce

meats

1 1/2 pound lean, freshly ground beef chuck
2 teaspoon olive oil
3/4 cup finely chopped onion
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper or coarsely c; racked black peppercorns
1/8 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1  salt, to taste
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon chopped shallots
1/2 cup dry red wine
1/4 cup fresh or canned chicken broth
2 tablespoon chopped parsley

Place the meat in a mixing bowl.  Heat the oil in a small cast-iron
skillet, add the onion and cook, stirring, until wilted. Add the
garlic and cook briefly, stirring. Do not let the garlic burn. Remove
from the heat and let cool.

Add the cooled onion mixture, chili powder, cumin, ground pepper, red
pepper flakes, Worcestershire sauce, and salt to the meat and blend
well. Divide the mixture into 4 patties of equal size.

Heat a heavy cast-iron skillet large enough to hold all the patties
in one layer.  Do not add fat of any kind. When the skillet is quite
hot and smoking, add the patties. Cook until well browned on one
side, then turn and cook 3 minutes more on the second side for medium
rare. Cook longer if desired.  Transfer to a warm plate.

Heat the butter in a small skillet.  Add the shallots and cook,
stirring for 1 minute.  Add the wine and broth and let cook until
reduced about 1/4 cup.  Check for seasoning and sprinkle with
parsley. Serve immediately. Note: If a heavy black cast-iron pan is
not available, use a heavy bottomed fry pan.   Serves 4 Typed in

Pheasant With Champagne Cabbage Vi (Assembly)

game, new york

1  pheasants **
1  pheasant stock **
1  mousseline stuffing **
1  pheasant sauce **
1  champagne cabbage **
6 tablespoon butter, clarified **

** See recipes for Clarified Butter, Pheasant with Champagne
Cabbage I (Stock), Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage II (Stuffing),
Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage III (Sauce), Pheasant with Champagne
Cabbage IV (Pheasant), and Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage V
(Cabbage).

To Assemble:

Place the leg-thigh portions of the Pheasants, skin side down and
short ends toward yourself between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; flatten
gently with a mallet or side of a cleaver.

Spread about 1/3 cup of stuffing on each portion and fold meat
over to form a 1/2-inch border on each of the 2 long sides.

Starting with a short side, roll the stuffing and meat into a
neat cylinder.  Use kitchen twine to tie compactly, wrapping twine
around once lengthwise and 3 times crosswise.  Chill, covered, until
firm (at least 30 minutes.)

Preheat oven to 450 F.

Heat 6 tablespoons of clarified butter in a large oven-proof
skillet.

Salt and pepper the stuffed leg packages and saute, shaking pan
occasionally, until golden on all sides (about 4 minutes.) Place
skillet in oven and roast for 4 minutes.

Return skillet to the top of stove over medium-high heat.  Add
breast halves to the pan, skin side up, and sprinkle with salt and
pepper. Saute for 2 minutes, shaking pan occasionally.

Turn breasts skin side down, sprinkle with salt and pepper and
return to the oven until everything is tender (about 7 minutes.)

Transfer meat to work surface.  Cut leg-thigh portions crosswise
into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Thinly slice breasts lengthwise on a
diagonal.

To Serve:

Mound about 1/2 cup of cabbage in the center of each of 4 warmed
serving plates.  Place leg-thigh slices around bottom of each plate,
overlapping slightly.  Place breast slices in a fan pattern at top of
each plate, overlapping slightly.  Spoon some sauce around the meat
and cabbage; serve the rest of the sauce separately.

4 slice smithfield ham (thin)
1  whole chicken breast  boned and but; terflied
4  pieces fresh caul fat
1/4 cup water chestnut powder =or=- flour o; r cornstarch
4 cup peanut oil; for deep-frying
      ----VEGETABLE SAUCE----
2 tablespoon peanut oil
2  whole garlic cloves; crushed
2 slice fresh ginger root
4  fresh water chestnuts  peeled and s; ced lengthwise
1/2 cup bamboo shoots  sliced lengthwise
4  whole scallions  cut in 3-in pieces
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 tablespoon chinese rice wine =or=- dry sherry
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon cornstarch; dissolved in
1 tablespoon chicken broth; (cold)

LAY 2 SLICES OF HAM on 1 side of the butterflied breast. Refold the
breast, enclosing the ham. Lay the breast on a sheet of caul fat.
Roll up tight. The caul is sticky, so it needs nothing to seal it.
Dust the surface with water chestnut powder, flour or cornstarch.
Shake off the excess. Heat the oil in a wok to 350F (moderate). Slide
the chicken breasts into the oil, 1 by 1. When they have browned
(about 5 minutes), remove 1 from the oil and press it. If it feels
mushy, it needs more cooking. Remove and drain the chicken. Slice the
chicken, crosswise diagonally, into 1/2-inch pieces.

VEGETABLE SAUCE: Heat the oil in a wok and flavor with garlic and
ginger. Remove the garlic and ginger and add the water chestnuts,
bamboo shoots and scallions to the wok. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, then
add soy sauce, wine or sherry, and chicken broth. When the liquid
boils, stir in the dissolved cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Spread
the sauce on a platter as a bed for the sliced chicken breast.

sherry 2 large onions, thickly sliced 1. The night before serving,
remove any excess fat from the leg of pork and pierce the meat all
over with the tip of a knife. In a mortar, combine the garlic,
oregano, salt, and cumin, and mash into a paste. Place the pork in a
nonreactive pan and rub it well with the paste, sprinkle liberally
with pepper, add the orange juice, sherry, and onions, cover with
plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight, turning the meat several
times. 2. About 4 1/2 hours before serving, preheat the oven to 350
degrees. Remove the meat from the marinade, pat it dry, and reserve
the marinade. Place the pork in an aluminum-foil-lined roasting pan.
Roast 1 hour, turning the roast to brown on all sides. Insert a meat
thermometer, making sure it doesn't touch bone. Lower the oven
temperature to 325 degrees, pour the reserved marinade over it, cover
loosely with aluminum foil, and cook another 3 hours or so, turning
the meat once and basting frequently with pan juices, until the meat
reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees. Remove the foil
during the last 30 minutes of roasting, adding sherry if the meat
becomes dry. 3. When it is done, remove the leg of pork to a serving
platter and allow it to stand, covered with the foil, 15 minutes
before carving. Serve with Mojo Criollo (Creole Garlic Sauce). Makes

Pigeon, Hare & Ham Terrine

meats, pork, game, ethnic, uk

1  hare
2  pigeon breasts
2/3 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup cognac
4  juniper berries
2  shallots
1  oil for frying
4 ounce pork fat
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1  egg
1  fine sea salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
1 pound tissue-thin slices of
1  pork fat or unsmoked
1  streaky (fatty) bacon
8 ounce good quality cooked ham,
1  in 1 inch cubes
1  aspic powder or
1  powdered (unflavoured)
1  gelatine, to thicken
1  garnish:
1  gherkins
1  bay leaf

Remove all the meat from the hare and place it together with the skinned,
boned and lightly beaten pigeon breasts in a bowl. Add the wine, and Cognac
and crushed juniper berries and leave to marinate in a cool place overnight
or for 48 hours if possible. Turn the meat frequently.

Drain the meat and pat dry. Strain the marinade and reserve the liquid.
Preheat the oven to 375 F. Slice the shallots and saute them lightly in
oil. Reserve 5-6 large pieces of hare, and the pigeon breasts and cut into
strips. Mince (grind) the rest of the hare meat, the shallots and pork fat.
Add the thyme, marinade, beaten egg and salt and pepper to taste, and mix
well.

Line a terrine dish with the thin pork fat or bacon. Stretching the fat
thin can be done easily by holding it down on a board, and running the back
of a carving knife across it. Spread the minced (ground) mixture on the
bottom of the terrine, then place strips of marinated hare, pigeon and ham
on top. Continue adding layers of the minced (ground) mixture and hare,
pigeon and cubes of ham. Make sure that the last layer is the minced
(ground) mixture. Cover with a layer of fat and the lid.

Cook in a bain marie (a roasting pan with 5 cm/2 inches of water will work
just as well) for 1 1/4-1 1/2 hours. When cooked, the terrine will have
shrunk from the sides of the dish. Pierce the terrine with a skewer: if
there is no trace of blood and the juices run clear the terrine is done.
Remove the lid, place a weight on top and cool, preferably overnight,
before serving. Sometimes we pour off the juices, thicken them with a
little aspic powder or gelatine and pour them back over the terrine before
cooling. The flavour of the terrine improves if kept for 3-4 days before
serving. Before serving, remove the top layer of fat and decorate with
gherkins and a bay leaf.

Pizza Hut Crust

pork, bbq

2 pkg dry yeast
2/3 cup water (warm)
2 teaspoon sugar
2 cup water (cold)
3 tablespoon corn oil
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dry oregono leaves
6 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

Sprinkle yeast over warm water and stir in the sugar. Let stand about
5 minutes or until very bubbly.  Combine the remaining ingredients
with about half of the flour, beating to a smooth batter. Beat in the
yeast mixture and then with a sturdy spoon work in remaining flour
until you can toss it lightly on a floured surface and knead it until
it feels elastic in texture. The kneading may require abaout 2/3 cup
additional flour, that you will be coating your hand with as you
knead the dough. Don't let the dough become too stiff and yet you
don't want it to stick to your hands. Place it in a large plastic
food bag, which you can spray inside with Pam or wipe the inside of
it with oil and place the ball of kneaded douogh in this to rise
until doubled in bulk. Be sure the plastic bag is large enough that
it will permit the dough to double without splitting the bag. You can
place the bag of dough on a warm, sunny spot on the table or kitchen
counter which helps it to raise quickly and if it's summertime, place
the bag of dough (with open end sealed tightly with tape) in your car
with the windows up! When dough has doubled, punch it down and shape
it to fit two 15" round pizza pans that have been greased and dusted
in cornmeal. Add the sauce and topping ingredients exactly in the
order listed above, spreading each ingredients evenly over the dough.
Let this rise about 20 minutes in a warm place and then bake at 450~,
about 20 to 25 minutes, putting one pizza at a time on center rack of
the preheated oven. If you don't want a pizza-pizza and you can only
handle one of them, wrap the second pizza in foil or plastic and seal
it with tape to lock out all air. Freeze it before it rises the last
time. After letting it thaw 30 mintes, you can bake as directed above.

Pizza Uno's Deep Pan Chicago Style Pizza

pork, italian, pizza

1 cup warm tap water (110-115 deg)
1 pkg active dry yeast
3 1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup coarse ground cornmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup oil
1  filling:
1 pound mozzarella, sliced
1 pound sausage, removed from the casing an; d crumbled
28 ounce can whole tomatoes, drained and coa; rsely crushed
2  garlic cloves, minced
3 teaspoon dried oregano -or- 5 fresh basil le; aves, shredded
4 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Crust:

Pour  the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve the yeast
with a fork. Add 1 c of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt, and, and
vegetable oil. Mix well with a spoon. Continue stirring in the rest
of the flour 1/2 c at a time,  until  the dough comes away from the
sides of the bowl. Flour your hands and the work surface and kneed
the ball of dough until it is no longer sticky.

Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic wrap, for 45
to 60 minutes in a warm place, until it is doubled in bulk. Punch it
down and kneed it briefly. Press it into an oiled 15-inch deep dish
pizza pan, until it comes 2 inches  up the sides and is even on the
bottom of the pan. Let the  dough rise 15-20 minutes before filling.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

While  the  dough  is rising, prepare  the  filling. Cook the crumbled
sausage until it is no longer pink, drain it of its excess fat. Drain
and chop the tomatoes.

When  the dough has finished its second rising, lay the cheese over
the dough shell. Then distribute the sausage and garlic over the
cheese. Top with the tomatoes. Sprinkle on the seasonings and
Parmesan cheese.

Bake for 15 minutes at 500 degrees. Then lower the temperature to 400
degrees and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up a section of the
crust from time to time with a spatula to check on its color. The
crust will be golden brown when done.  Serve immediately.

2 cup elbow macaroni**
1 ounce maggi seasoning or 1 tb soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt, optional
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2  green onions, chopped

not to overcook)

Brown butter in Dutch oven. Add remaining ingredients except onions,
salt (if using) and pepper. Mix well. Simmer uncovered for 10
minutes. Add onions and cook 5 minutes more.

Melinda's notes: I got this from an old Polish acquaintance long ago.
I don't know how original Polish it is since it uses Maggi Seasoning,
which I think is German, but we like it. Maggi Seasoning comes in a
square-ish brown bottle and can be purchased in the gourmet section
of your supermarket. I always omit the salt. The original recipe
called for 4 ounce. sour cream, but I like it with 8 ounce. I usually use
the light sour cream, but the non-fat doesn't do well, it seems to
just dissolve and become tasteless.

Pork & Chicken Wing Adobo With Spinach

pork, chicken, chinese

2 pound chicken wings
1 1/2 pound boneless pork
3/4 cup palm vinegar, distilled white vineg; ar or cider vinegar
3 tablespoon light soy sauce
6  to 8 garlic cloves, peeled
2  shallots, chopped
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
2  bay leaves
1 1/2 cup water
1 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  fresh spinach, blanched
1  hot cooked rice

One of my all time favorite things to eat...

There are many ways of preparing adobo.  In this recipe, the sauce is
reduced to a rich savory glaze to coat the pork and chicken.

Cut chicken wings between the joints.  Remove tips and save for
stock. Trim fat from pork.  Cut meat into 1-inch cubes.

Combine the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, shallots, pepper, salt and bay
leaves in a non aluminum saucepan; add wings and pork, toss well to
coat and let marinate for 1 to 3 hours.

Add the water to the saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer for 20 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken and
set aside. Let pork cook for 20 minutes longer. Remove the pork.

Reduce the sauce over high heat to about 1 cup; strain into a bowl.
Spoon off fat.

Heat the oil in a skillet; add chicken and pork and saute until nicely
browned.

Heat the sauce, then combine with chicken and pork. Serve hot on a
bed of blanched spin- spinach and steamed rice.

Pork & Scallops With Crisp Ginger

meats, pork, seafood

1 pound asparagus
1 large red pepper
2  2-3 pieces ginger
1  pork tenderloin; (about 3/4 lb)
2 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoon dry sherry
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup canola oil
1/2 pound brown mushrooms
1/4 teaspoon salt; optional
3/4 pound bay scallops

To remove tough ends from tender asparagus spears--the easy way, hold
base of stalk firmly and bend.  End will snap and break off at just
the right spot for the best eating.

About 1 hour before serving, discard tough ends from asparagus, trim
scales, cut diagonally into 3-inch pieces. Cut pepper into strips.
Peel ginger; grate 1 teaspoon. Cut remaining ginger lengthwise into
very thin slices; cut slices into hair-thin strips.  Cut pork
tenderloin into 1/8-inch-thick slices.  In bowl, mix pork, soy sauce,
sherry, cornstarch, sugar, and grated ginger.

In 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, in hot oil, cook ginger
strips about 1 minute or so until it has a light browned color.
Remove ginger with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. In oil
remaining in skillet, cook asparagus, red pepper, mushrooms, and salt
(optional) until vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring quickly and
frequently. With slotted spoon, remove vegetables to plate.

In oil remaining in skillet over high heat, cook pork mixture over
high heat a minute or so.  Add scallops and cook until pork loses its
pink color and scallops are tender about 2 to 3 minutes, adding a
little more oil if it is needed.  Return vegetables to skillet;
stir-fry until heated through. Spoon pork mixture onto platter;
sprinkle with ginger strips. Makes 6 servings.

Note: Meat slices more easily if it is frozen slightly (about 40
minutes). You can hold your knife on a slant and slice across the
width to get nicely uniform pieces.

Pork Braised With Celery Avgolemono

meats, pork, greek

1  karen mintzias
3 pound lean shoulder or leg of pork
4 tablespoon butter or margarine
1  onion; finely chopped
1  salt and freshly ground pepper
3 cup hot water (approximately)
1  bunch celery
2 tablespoon flour
2  egg yolks
1 1/2  lemons (juice only)
1  parsley or celery leaves

Wipe the pork with damp paper towels, then cut into 1-1/2 inch cubes
(the fat and skin may be left on during the cooking and removed
later). Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy pan or Dutch
oven. Add the onion and cook until soft and transparent, then add the
pork and cook, stirring, over medium heat until the raw meat color
disappears. Season with salt and pepper, add hot water to cover, then
cover and simmer gently (or bake in a 325 F oven) for 30 to 35
minutes, or until almost tender. (The timing is important because the
celery is to be added and cooked with the pork only until both are
tender but not overcooked.)

Meanwhile, prepare the celery.  Wash the stalks and scrape the heavy
ones slightly.  Cut each stalk once lengthwise (if large) and then
across into 1-1/2 inch slices. (Use the leaves as well, if desired,
but a few might be saved for a garnish or an accompanying salad.) Add
the celery to pork and continue simmering 25 minutes until both are
tender. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pork and celery and place
in a serving dish, first removing and discarding the fat from the
meat. Keep warm. Skim the fat from the cooking liquid, then add water
or boil down rapidly to make to make 1-1/2 cups. Keep hot while you
prepare the avgolemono.

To prepare the avgolemono, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in
a pan.  Stir in the flour, and after cooking over low heat for 1
minute, gradually add 2 cups of the hot cooking liquid from the meat.
Stir until the sauce comes to a boil.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl,
beat the two remaining egg yolks and add the lemon juice, droplet by
droplet, beating all the while. Beat a little of the thickened
cooking liquid into the yolk mixture, then add the yolks to the pan
of hot liquid. Mix well and cook over low heat until thickened. Pour
the hot sauce over the pork and celery, garnish with parsley or
celery leaves and serve warm.

Note: Celeriac may be substituted for the celery.  Use 2-1/2 pounds of
celeriac, and peel, quarter, and cut it into 1/2 inch slices before
adding it to the pork. A little scraped, diced carrot may be added
with the celery.

Flour, season and brown pork chops in skillet, set aside. Peel and slice
enough potatoes to line roasting pan, filling to desired depth. Slice
an onion over the raw potatoes and salt to taste. Place browned pork
chops on top of potatoes. Pour two cans of cream of mushroom soup and
a can of water over the chops. Bake (maybe 350F) uncovered about 1
hour or until potatoes are done. Length of time depends on the amount
of food as explained below... You can use as few pork chops and
potatoes as you want, or as many as you can cram into the pan. I
generally buy a pork loin or whatever is on sale at my favorite
supermarket. I've even substituted pork steak for pork chops and that
works too. I found that adding a little more wateer makes more gravy
over potatoes.

1  seeds, cut into 1/4-in. dice
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cup onion, chopped fine
1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced
1/4 pound mushrooms, diced
1/2 cup parsley, minced
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
1  egg, lightly beaten
4  loin pork chops
1  each abut 1-in. thick
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
3/4 cup chicken broth

1. Preheat the oven to 300. Put the bread cubes in a baking dish and

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan and add 1 cup of the chopped
onion, the garlic and the mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until wilted.
Spoon the mixture into a mixing bowl and add the parsley, caraway

the surface of the meat, split each chop in half to the bone, top to
bottom, but do not cut entirely through. Place the flaps of each chop

enough to hold the chops in one layer without crowding. Add the chops
and cook over moderately high heat about 4 min on each side until
well browned. Continue cooking, turning occasionally, about 15 min.
Transfer the chops to a hot serving dish and keep warm. 5. Pour off
the fat from the skillet and add the remaining onion. Cook, stirring,
about 1 min. then add the vinegar and stir well. Add the broth and
bring to a boil, stirring. 6. Remove the toothpicks from the chops.

Pork Medallions With Maple-Vinegar Sauce

pork

1 pound pork chops; loin, boneless,
1  pepper
2 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup shallot; minced
2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 cup chicken broth; canned
2 tablespoon maple syrup
2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

Approx. Cook Time:  0:30

Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, flatten the pork between sheets of
waxed paper to about quarter-inch thickness.  Season both sides of
the pork with pepper.  Melt the butter in a heavy large skillet over
medium-high heat.  Add the pork and saut until it is brown and
cooked through, about four minutes per side, then transfer them to a
plate. Add the shallots to the same skillet, and cook for 30 seconds.
Mix in the mustard and chicken broth and simmer until it is red uced
by one-quarter, about five minutes. Stir in the maple syrup and
vinegar. Simmer until the liquids are reduced to sauce consistency,
about five minutes longer. Return the pork and accumulated juices to
the skillet. Cook until they are just heated through, about one
minute.  Arrange the pork on a platter. Spoon sauce over and serve.
30 Minute Main Course.

Note:  The sweet-and-sour sauce complements the pork deliciously.
Mashed potatoes with chives, some green peas and a purchased apple
tart would complete the meal nicely.

Pork Mignonnes With Orange & Green Pepperco

pork

1 large navel oranges
1  juice
5 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon sunflower oil
1 1/2 pound boneless pork top loin --
1  sliced, 1/2 thick
1  salt, to taste
1  pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon orange liqueur -- grand
1  marnier prefer
1 teaspoon green peppercorns -- drained
1  and rinsed
1 cup beef stock
1  parsley sprigs
1  orange

1. Remove zest (orange part only) from navel orange (reserving
orange) and sliver in fine julienne. Blanch zest in boiling water to
cover for 10 minutes, dropping whole juice orange into water during
final minute to warm it (and maximize amount of juice yielded). Drain
zest and juice orange and reserve. Squeeze juice orange to obtain
about 1/3 cup juice. In a small, heavy, enameled or teflon-coated
saucepan over low heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Stir in
sugar until sugar melts and mixture turns golden. Add orange juice
and zest and cook over low heat until sauce is thick. Reserve sauce.

2. Divide peeled navel orange into sections, and reserve sections at
room temperature. In a large, heavy skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of
the butter plus the oil until hot. Season pork with salt and pepper
and, raising heat to high, saute meat rapidly on both sides until
browned and cooked through (about 2 minutes per side). Add liqueur;
it will bubble and quickly reduce to a glaze. Remove pork from
skillet, place in serving dish, and keep warm. (Tent with aluminum
foil and place in a turned-off oven.)

3. Lower heat, add green peppercorns to skillet and crush them with
the back of a spoon. Add stock. Turn up heat to high and, stirring
constantly, rapidly reduce liquid to 1/3 cup. Add reserved orange
sauce and salt and black pepper to taste; reduce heat to a simmer and
cook 2 more minutes.

4. Cut remaining 2 tablespoons butter in small pieces and, with pan
off heat, swirl into skillet one by one. Pour any juices yielded by
pork into sauce. Place orange sections in sauce. Nap pork with sauce
and orange sections and garnish with fresh parsley sprigs.

Pork Roast (Korean Chaeyuk Kui)

main dish, meats, pork, ethnic, korean

1/2 pound pork shoulder or other lean- pork
2 each scallions
1 each clove garlic
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 tablespoon sugar
1  dash black pepper
4 tablespoon kochu chang

This dish is fairly spicy: it gets its highly seasoned flavor from
kochee chang (Red Bean Paste, found in many Oriental food stores. If
it is not available, Japanese miso sauce amy be substituted).
Although the amount indicated is recommended, it is possible to use a
little less.

1.  Cut the pork into 4 or 5 slices about 1/4 inch thick.

2.  Mince the scallions. Mince or crush the garlic. Combine both
ingredients with the remaining seasonings in a bowl. Add the pork
slices and mix well until all sides of the pork are coated.

3. Grill immediately or marinate until ready to serve. It is
important that the pork be well done; the outside should be dark,
almost charred. A charcoal, an electric or an oven grill may be used.

Pork Scaloppine With Marsala & Mushrooms

pork, italian

1 pound pork tenderloin; cut into slices 1/4 to 1/
1  flour
6 tablespoon clarified butter
6 large mushroom; thinly sliced
1  shallot; minced
2/3 cup marsala
1/3 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoon butter, unsalted; cut into pieces
1  salt and pepper

Place the pork slices between two sheets of plastic wrap. Flatten each
piece to thickness of about 3/16". Dip the slices lightly in flour,
shaking off the excess.

Preheat the oven to 200 F. Heat half the clarified butter in a heavy
large skillet over medium-high heat until it is hot but not brown.
Add the pork to the skillet in batches so their sides do not touch
and saute them until golden, about two to three minutes per side; add
butter as needed. Transfer to a platter and keep warm in the oven.
Pour off all but about two tablespoons of butter from the skillet.
Place over high heat, and add the mushrooms and shallot. Saute until
they begin to color. Blend in the Marsala and stock.

Boil over high heat, scraping up any browned bits clinging to bottom
of pan, until reduced by half. Remove from heat and add remaining
butter, swirling until it is well blended and the sauce is slightly
thickened. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Pour over the pork
and serve.

1 1/3 ounce pork fat
4  black mushrooms (pre-softened)
1  precooked bamboo shoot
1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon cooking wine
1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
30  won ton skins
24  green peas

Filling: dice the pork, fat, mushrooms, and bamboo shoot. Place in
bowl. Add liquids and seasonings and stir well. Throw filling against
inside of bowl for 3-4 minutes so ingredients combine thoroughly.
Divide into 24 portions.

Place one filling in center of won ton skin. Cup skin up around
filling but don't close - 'make a waist'. Place one green pea in the
center of the filling.  Use knife to compress and even out filling
until below top edge of skin. Place in steamer about half inch apart.
Steam for six minutes on high.  Remove. Serve.

You can use beef, shrimp, quail eggs, or sweet rice for the above.

You can get 'won ton' and 'dumpling' skins as well as egg roll
wrappers at local chinese groceries.  You can make your own; but
ready-made fresh or frozen ones are quicker.

Pork With Apples & Toasted Walnuts

pork

1/2 cup walnuts -- broken
4  pork loin chops -- each 1
1  inch thick
1  salt and freshly ground
1  pepper
1/3 cup apple juice
2 tablespoon brandy
1  clove garlic -- minced
3/4 teaspoon fresh thyme -- finely
1  chopped
1/2 pound tart green apples -- cored
1  sliced 1/4

1. In a large, heavy skillet over high heat, toast walnuts 2 to 3
minutes, stirring frequently. Remove and set aside.

2. Season chops with salt and pepper to taste. Trim a piece of fat
from the edge of one chop. In the same skillet over medium-high heat,
heat fat until lightly browned, using a spoon to press and rub fat
over bottom of skillet to grease it well. Discard fat and increase
heat to high.

3. Add chops; brown quickly on both sides. Pour excess fat, if any,
from skillet.

4. Add apple juice, brandy, garlic, thyme, and apples to pan.

5. Cover pan and cook over medium-low heat 5 to 8 minutes. To test for
doneness, cut into a chop; it should be tender, juicy, and slightly
pink. If pork is done and apples are still crunchy, remove pork to a
platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Continue to cook apples
until they are tender.

6. Stir walnuts into sauce in pan. Pour walnut-apple sauce over chops.
Serve chops immediately.

Pork With Coriander & Red Wine

meats, pork, sauces

1 1/2 pound loin of pork
4 teaspoon coriander seeds, crushed
1 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cup dry red wine
3 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup coriander leaves, coarse

1. Cut the pork into 1-in. cubes and place them in a mixing bowl. Add
1 teaspoon of the coriander seed, the peppercorns and sugar and stir well
to blend. Cover the bowl and let marinate for a least 20 min. If you
can leave the meat for longer, you will need to pat it dry with a
paper towel befor cooking. 2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large
enough to hold the pork cubes in one layer. When the oil is quite
hot, aromatic and almost smoking, add the meat. Cook, turning often
to brown evenly, about 2-3 min. 3. Add the wine to the skillet and
bring to a boil, stirring. After 1-2 min.,reduce the heat to low and
cook gently, turning the meat occasionally, until the meat is tender
and the wine reduced to about 4 tablespoon. This should take about 20 min.
4. Add the butter and the remaining coriander seeds. Increase the
heat to medium high and stir well to mix the melted butter with the
wine for a few sec. Add the coriander leaves, toss to coat the meat
and serve.

Pork With Fermented Bean Curd

pork, chinese

1 1/2 cup chicken broth
1 1/2 cup water
1 1/2 pound boneless pork (loin or butt) in 1 c; ubes
1 centiliter garlic, mashed
1 tablespoon soy sauce
5  scallions, rinsed, green parts only
2  pcs fermented bean curd
3 tablespoon dry sherry

Bring liquids to a boil. Add pork, garlic, and soy. Reduce heat and
simmer 30 min, skimming crud off occasionally. Slice the scallions
into 1" pieces and dump them in. Add the bean curd and mash it around
until it's incorporated in the sauce. Add sherry (if you use more
bean curd, use less sherry; if you use less bean curd, use more
sherry). Continue to simmer until pork is tender, 15 to 30 min more.
You may put a slice or two of ginger in with the garlic, but my
mother never did that.

This dish should have visible fat. The sauce should be thin and have a
slightly curdled look to it. To pay lip service to western
sensibilities, you might consider serving it surrounded with a
stir-fried green vegetable (my mother used spinach). Warning: do not
even think of making this dish with totally lean meat! It just won't
work - the meat will be stringy and tasteless. Butt or fresh bacon is
the traditional way, but the fattier and gristlier ends of loin,
after all the stir-fryable parts have been cut away, will do.

Pork With Rhubarb Sauce

pork, low cal

3 pound pork loin center rib roast (8 ribs)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper; coarsely ground
1/2 pound rhubarb, fresh; chopped (2 cups)
1/4 cup apple juice concentrate; thawed
2 tablespoon honey
1  nutmeg, ground
2 tablespoon ; water
1 teaspoon cornstarch

Have the butcher loosen the pork roast backbone, if possible, for
easier carving.  Rub the roast with salt and pepper. Place bone side
down in a small, shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into
the thickest portion of the roast; make sure bulb doesn't touch bone,
fat, or the pan. Roast, uncovered, at 325 F. until the thermometer
reads 150 F., about 75 to 90 minutes.

For the sauce, in a medium saucepan stir together the rhubarb, apple
juice concentrate, honey, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil; reduce the
heat, cover, and simmer ten minutes or until the rhubarb is very
tender. Mix the water and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture.
Cook and stir until the sauce is thickened and bubbly. Continue
cooking for two minutes more.

When the meat thermometer registers 150 F., spoon some of the sauce
over the roast.  Continue roasting until the thermometer reads 170
F., about 30 to 45 minutes more. Spoon on additional sauce
occasionally. Let the roast stand 15 minutes before carving.  Heat
any remaining sauce and pass with the roast.

MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Prepare and roast the pork as directed. For the
sauce, in a 1 1/2-quart microwave casserole cook the rhubarb, apple
juice concentrate, honey and nutmeg, covered, on HIGH until the
rhubarb is very tender, about five to seven minutes.  Mix the water
and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture. Cook, uncovered, until
the sauce is thickened and bubbly, about one to two minutes, stirring
every 30 seconds. Continue cooking for one minute more. Spoon over
the roast as directed and pass the remainder with the roast.

2 1/2 cup flour *
1 cup water *
2 ounce cabbage (1/2 cup cooked and  choppe; d)
1/2 pound lean ground pork
1  green onion, chopped
1 teaspoon chopped ginger
1 tablespoon tientsin preserved vegetable  rinse; d and chopped
2 tablespoon oil
1 cup chicken stock
      ----SEASONING----
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon thin soy sauce
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1 teaspoon white wine
1  dash of pepper
2 teaspoon cornstarch
      ----DIP----
2 teaspoon thin soy sauce
1 teaspoon hot spiced oil
1 teaspoon white vinegar

Combine flour and cold water in large mixing bowl. Mix thoroughly to
form dough.  Cover with damp cloth; let stand for 20 minutes. *

Cook cabbage 2 minutes in boiling water.  Rinse in cold water, and
drain. Squeeze dry of all excess moisture. Chop fine; set aside.

Place the ground pork, chopped green onion, chopped ginger, and
preserved vegetables together on chopping board. Mix and chop with
the clever for approximately
15    strokes.

Add "seasoning" and the cabbage to the pork mixture and mix
thoroughly.

After dough has set for 20 minutes, knead it for 1 minute and then
form into 2 to 3 rolls, approximately 1-1/2 inch in diameter. Cut
each roll of dough into slice 1-1/2 inch thick.

With a small rolling pin, or heel of hand, flatten each piece of
dough into a thin patty, 3 inch in diameter. Place 1/4 tablespoon of
the pork mixture in the center of each patty. Fold in half, and seal
the edges by pressing firmly together with your fingers. (Help
ready-made skins to seal by applying egg white to the edges.)

Set each pot sticker with the straight edge on a platter, pressing
firmly so as to form a flat base. Each pot sticker should be made to
stand upright, rather than allowed to rest flat on its side.

Heat frying pan and add 2 tablespoon oil.  On medium heat, pan-fry pot
stickers.  Cook on the base surface only. Pan-fry 2 minutes, until
the base side is nicely browned.

Add 1 cup chicken stock to the pot stickers.  Cover and cook over
medium heat for approximately 7 minutes, until most of the chicken
stock is absorbed.  Remove to platter.

Mix thin soy sauce, hot spiced oil, and white vinegar to use as
condiment for Pot Stickers.

* Pot sticker skins can be purchased at Chinese groceries.

Pot Stickers Filling

appetizers, pork, chinese

1/2 pound ground pork
1/2 small head chinese (napa) cabbage,
1  cored and chopped
1  green onion, coarsely
1  chopped
2  thumb-size slices fresh ginger
2  water chestnuts, chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
1  pinch white pepper
1 teaspoon oriental sesame oil
5 tablespoon vegetable oil, divided
1 cup water

Combine pork, cabbage, green onion, ginger, water chestnuts, salt,
sugar, white pepper and sesame oil, and refrigerate until read to use.

Fill pot stickers by spooning 1 level tablespoon of filling into
center of each pancake.  Fold dough over to make half-circle and
pleat edges firmly together. Pinch shut to seal, then decoratively
mark with the point of a dinner knife.

To pan-fry, heat cast-iron or wok or other heavy-bottom skillet over
moderate heat.  Add 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, swirling to coat
bottom. When oil is hot, place pot stickers, seam side up in skillet
and agitate (shake) for 30 seconds.  (You may need to do this in two
batches.)

Pour in 1 cup water, cover, and gently boil over moderate heat for 7
to 8 minutes.  When oil and water start to sizzle, add remaining 2
tablespoons oil, if needed. Tip skillet to distribute oil evenly;
watch carefully (uncovered) to prevent sticking.  When bottoms are
brown, remove from heat and carefully lift out pot stickers with
spatula.

To serve, turn pot stickers over (dark side up) and arrange on serving
platter.  Serve with dipping sauce.

TIPS: When cutting into these in recipe testing, we discovered the
pork filling appeared pink in some, even though the meat was done.

You can freeze uncooked pot stickers for later use but remember to
squeeze out the water from cabbage during preparation (in a colander
or cheesecloth).  Freeze pot stickers separately on cookie sheets
until firm, then put them in plastic bags.

When rolling out the pancakes, leave the centers slightly thicker
that the edges.  A thicker center will hold up better during the
browning.

If you prefer, steam pot stickers for about 12 minutes over boiling
water instead of pan-frying.

1/4 pound boneless beef
1 cup corn cut from the cob
3 pound chicken
2  white potatoes, boiled in jackets
1/2 pound ham
3  barely ripe bananas
1 large onion
1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds, crushed
3  cloves garlic
1/4 teaspoon pepper

3 tablespoon oil (or butter)
1 teaspoon salt
2  pears
2 quart chicken broth
3  peaches
1/2 small cabbage
2  limes
2 small turnips
1 large carrot

"Puchero is to Mexican cooking what Pot-au-Feu is to French. The
difference lies in Puchero's imaginative combination of vegetables
and fruits. Since it is even more delicious the second day, this
recipe will make an ample amount to serve 8 for dinner, with some
left over for lunch the following day."

Place the chick peas in a kettle, cover with broth, and soak
overnight.

Cut the lamb and beef into 2-inch cubes, cut the chicken into serving
pieces, and dice the ham.  Peel and slice the onion and garlic.
Combine the drained chick peas, all the meats, the veal knuckle,
onion, garlic, and salt in a large soup kettle.  Cover with 2 quarts
of cold water and bring to a full boil.  Skim off the froth. Lower
the heat, cover, and simmer for
45    minutes.

Cut the cabbage into eight wedges. Peel and slice the turnips and
carrot. Slice the zucchini. Peel and dice the sweet potatoes. Cut the
corn from the cob.  Add the cabbage, turnips, carrot, zucchini, sweet
potatoes, and corn to the kettle. Cover and simmer about 20 minutes
or until meats and vegetables are tender.

Peel the boiled white potatoes and cut into thick slices. Peel
bananas and cut into 2-inch slices. Saute potatoes, sprinkled with
crushed coriander seeds and pepper in oil. Remove the potato slices
with a slotted spoon. Keep warm.  In the same oil saute the bananas
until golden. Keep warm with the potatoes.

Peel, core, and slice the pears and peaches.  Put in a small pan with
a little water and poach for 10 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain the
fruit.

Adjust the seasonings. Serve each bowl of soup with the juice from
one lime wedge and a Tbsp. of Guacamole.

Red Currant-Glazed Pork Chops

pork

4  pork loin chops; about 4 oz.
3/4 teaspoon rubbed sage
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1  vegetable spray; (e.g. pam)
1/4 cup red currant jelly
2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

Recipe by: Kelly Day Rubenstein <KDAY@ERS.BITNET> Trim fat from chops.
Sprinkle with sage, pepper and salt on both sides of chops. Coat a
non-stick skillet with cooking spray, place over medium heat until hot
(provided your cookware allows this - mine doesn't so I put the chops
in cold.)  Add chops, and cook for 7 minutes on each side, until
done. Remove chops, keep warm.

Add jelly and vinegar to skillet and cook until thickened (about 2
mintues), stirring constantly. Spoon over chops.

Note: being paranoid about food-borne illness, I kept the chops in the
skillet while making the sauce (extra cooking time). They still
turned out great

Red Hot Grilled Potatoes

pork, potato

12 small new white potatoes,  about 2 1/4 po; total
3 tablespoon light-tasting olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoon hungarian paprika
3/4 teaspoon chili powder
3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon salt

1.  Put rack in center of oven; heat oven to 400 degrees. Have ready
foil-lined baking pan, large enough to hold potatoes in a single
layer.

2.  Put potatoes in plastic food bag.  In small dish, combine
remaining ingredients.  Add mixture to potatoes. Shake bag to coat
potatoes. Transfer potatoes in a single layer to prepared baking
sheet. Drizzle any remaining oil and spices over potatoes.

3.  Bake until just barely tender (but still firm), 25 to 30 minutes,
depending on size of potatoes.  Turn a few times during baking. Can be
baked several hours ahead and kept at room temperature.

4.  To serve, sprinkle with salt and place over hot barbecue fire
until seared and hot, just a few minutes, turning often. Serve hot.

These potatoes are "red hot" from the paprika, chili powder and
cayenne pepper.  Omit the pepper if you prefer a milder taste. These
potatoes can be roasted several hours ahead and kept at room
temperature before grilling at dinner time.

Red-Cooked Pot Roast (Shanghai Pot Roast)

meats, pork, chinese, beef

4 pound chuck roast, boneless, not too lean
1 tablespoon sherry
1/2 cup regular soy sauce
1 cup water
2 slice ginger
2 centiliter garlic, optional
1 ounce sugar
2  star anise stars (optional for pork; )

Either brown the roast in a little fat or dunk it in boiling water for a
minute or so [this step is optional]. Put it into a heavy kettle into which
it fits fairly snugly. Add all the rest of the ingredients (ginger slices,
star anise, and garlic should be at the bottom of the pot). Bring to a
boil, then reduce heat and simmer covered, turning and basting
occasionally, for 3 hours or until tender. Serve sliced, hot or cold. If
cold, you may want to weight it down with a brick covered in foil or some
similarly heavy item while chilling it in the fridge.

You may cook lamb or pork this way, but cut the cooking time to 2 - 2 1/2
hr. For lamb add a cinnamon stick instead of the star anise; for pork
double the soy sauce and sherry, either halve or omit the star anise, and
use up to 4 ounce of sugar to taste.

Ribbe

main dish, pork, christmas, norwegian

3 kg pork ribs
1  salt
1  pepper
2 1/2 deciliter water

The steak should be without the pork chop part. If you prefer to use a
loin, extend the time in the oven to 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Break the ribs
every 5 centimeters. Make a checkerboard pattern on the skin side
with a sharp knife. 1-2 days before the steak goes in the oven rub it
with salt and pepper and lay it with the skin-side down. Heat the
oven to 230 C. Put the steak in with the skin-side down. Put some
water in the tray with it. Cover the steak. Let it be for 20 minutes.
Take away the cowering, turn the steak, reduce temperature to 175 C.
Place it high in the oven. Ready after 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Be sure that
the skin does not get black, it should just be slightly crispy. Cut
into pieces; between the ribs and where you broke the bones. When
served warm it should be accompanied by surkaal, sweet mustard and
hot fat. Is also served cold. Either in pieces or sliced to go on a
loaf of bread. Norwegians still prefer it with sweet mustard.

Roast Fresh Ham~ Tudor Style

pork

1  fresh ham or fresh pork shoulder, w; hole or half,
1  bone in or boneless
2 large onions, chopped
2 large carrots, chopped
2  stalks celery, including leaves, ch; opped
3  cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon brown caraway seeds
1 teaspoon black caraway seeds (if not availab; le, use brown)
1 teaspoon celery seed
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, or 1 teaspoon whole; cloves
1 tablespoon whole allspice, or 1 teaspoon groun; d allspice
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 tablespoon black peppercorns
1 large bay leaf
1  salt, to taste (optional)
1 1/2 cup red table wine
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup cognac (optional)

Trim every bit of fat possible off the meat and discard. Place the
meat in a large non-metal container.

Mix all of the other ingredients together and pour over the meat.
Marinate the meat in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or up to 8
days. Turn the meat several times during marination so that no
section is allowed to become dry.

When ready to roast, transfer the meat to a large heavy roaster pan
(an enameled iron roaster with a lid would be ideal). Remove the bay
leaf, peppercorns, whole allspice and whole cloves (if used) from the
marinade and pour the marinade over the meat.

Roast the meat in a 350 F oven, basting frequently. Allow 30 to 40
minutes per pound.  The inside temperature should be 165 F to 175F as
measured with a meat thermometer. Remove the cover during the last
1/2 hour. You should be able to "cut with a fork" when done. If the
pan becomes too dry, add additional red wine and/or water, 1/2 cup at
a time. You will want at least 1 cup of liquid remaining in the
panwhen the roast is done.

Transfer the roast to a carving platter and allow it to cool slightly
before carving.  If desired, serve surrounded with small baked apples
or spiced crab apples.

HUNTER'S SAUCE:  Strain the liquid and vegetables from the roasting
pan. Transfer the vegetables to a food processor or blender. Return
the liquid to the roasting pan and skim off as much fat as possible.
Add 1/2 cup of hot water to the pan and bring to a boil over high
heat, scraping up the particles adhering to the pan. Reduce the
liquid to 1 cup.

Puree the vegetables in the food processor or blender. Add the reduced
cooking liquid and blend until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan
and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. If the sauce is too thick,
thin to the desired consistency with hot water.  Serve in a silver or
pewter pitcher, bowl or sauceboat.

Roast Pork (Char Shu)

meats, pork, chinese

1 cup water
6 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup dark soy sauce
1/4 cup rice wine
1 centiliter garlic
3 slice ginger root
3 pound pork -- butt, shoulder,
1  tenderloin

PREPARATION:

Heat water and add sugar and salt, stirring until melted. Remove from
stove.  Add soy sauce and rice wine. Smash, peel, and mince garlic,
and add to the soy sauce mixture. Peel and mince ginger root and add.
Mix well. Place meat in a bowl and pour the mixture over it. If meat
is not completely covered, you will need to turn it frequently as it
marinates. Allow it to stand in the refrigerator for 48 hours. (You
can cheat and make the marinating time shorter -- never shorter than
6 hours -- but the longer the time, the more the meat will tenderize
and absorb the fine flavor.) Pour off marinade, but do not wipe meat.
Place the meat on a rack in a baking pan.

COOKING:

Heat oven to 450-degrees.  Bake the meat for 10 minutes. Reduce heat
to 250-degrees and bake for 30 minutes. Turn meat over and bake for
another 30 minutes.

Roast Pork Loin With Sage Crust & Apple Bra

pork

1 ounce fresh sage; woody stems re- moved, ch
2  cloves garlic; crushed (or3)
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns; crushed
2 pound pork loin, center-cut; boneless
2 cup veal stock; divided use*
2 medium apples, tart; (granny smith or braeburn
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup shallots; chopped
1 ounce fresh basil leaves; chopped (about 1/2 cup)
1/4 cup calvados apple brandy**
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1  salt and pepper to taste

* Defatted chicken stock or chicken broth may be substituted for the
veal stock. Frozen concentrated stock, which need not be defatted, is
sold at some specialty markets. "Perfect Addition" is a line of
frozen concentrated stock bases. It has just introduced a veal stock,
which isn't yet in full distribution.

**Brandy or Armagnac may be substituted for the Calvados.

1. Combine sage, garlic, 1/4 cup olive oil and peppercorns in a
shallow glass or other non-metal dish. Place pork loin in dish and
pat sage-garlic mixture on all sides. Cover and marinate in the
refrigerator at least 8 hours or overnight.

2. Place pork on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast in a preheated
450-degree oven for 15 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees
and roast until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees, about
25 to
30    more minutes.

3. Transfer meat to a hot platter. Cover with aluminum foil or place
in a warm oven to keep warm. Let meat rest for several minutes before
slicing.

4. Meanwhile, add 1/4 cup of hot stock to pan. With a fork or a wooden
spoon, scrape up browned bits from bottom of pan. Skim off fat. Pour
drippings into a cup.

5. To make the sauce: Core apples, but do not peel them. Chop into
1-inch cubes. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saucepan. Add
shallots and saute over medium heat until lightly browned, about 3 to
5 minutes. Add apples and basil, stirring to combine. Add Calvados.
Raise heat to medium-high. Stand back and ignite sauce with a long
match. (Or pour Calvados into a heat-safe ladle and ignite, then pour
into pan.) Stir in pan drippings and remaining 1 3/4 cup veal stock;
continue cooking over low heat for 15 minutes to reduce sauce.
Dissolve cornstarch in 2 tablespoons cold water and stir it into the
pan. Bring mixture to a full boil. Cook, stirring often, until sauce
thickens, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Season with salt and
pepper. Serve immediately alongside pork.

Roast Turkey With Chestnut Stuffing

main dish, poultry, pork, nuts

1  fresh turkey; with giblets - (10 to 12
4 tablespoon unsalted butter (1/2 stick) - at ro; om temperature
1 pound fresh chestnuts; peeled*
3 cup ; water
1 pound pork sausage
2  shallots; peeled - finely chopped
1/4 cup fresh parsley; fine chopped
4  fresh thyme sprigs or
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1  bay leaf
1  salt and pepper; to taste
2  garlic cloves - peeled and minced
2  eggs; beaten
1 cup dry white wine
2 large onions; peeled - each cut into 8
4 medium carrots; peeled - cut in 2 pieces

*To peel chestnuts, make a small cut on the flat side of each
chestnut, making sure to cut all the way through the outer skin.
Place chestnuts in a medium-size saucepan, cover with water, and
bring to a boil over high heat. Then reduce heat to low.  Remove
several chestnuts from the water and peel them with a sharp paring
knife, being sure to remove both the outer peel and the dark inner
skin that is attached to the meat. If the chestnuts cool before you
have a chance to peel them, place them back in the water to heat, as
it is virtually impossible to remove the inner skin when the chestnut
is cool.

Remove giblets and neck from the turkey; set aside. Rinse the turkey
well inside and out until the water runs clear. Pat it thoroughly
dry. Carefully separate the skin from the breast by running your
fingers between the skin and the meat, being careful not to poke any
holes in the skin. Spread the butter on the meat.

Bring the water to a boil in a vegetable steamer over high heat. Add
the chestnuts, cover, and steam until they are tender, about 30
minutes. Remove the steamer basket from the heat.

In a medium-size bowl, gently break the chestnuts into bite-size
pieces. Mixing well after each addition, stir in the pork, shallots,
herbs, salt and pepper, garlic and eggs. Chop giblets and add them to
the mixture, mixing well.  To test for seasoning, pinch off a
teaspoon of the mixture and cook it in a small skillet over medium
heat until it is cooked through. Taste for seasoning and adjust
accordingly.

Fill the turkey with as much stuffing as it will hold, but don't pack
it tightly.  Truss the turkey.  Place the turkey in a large roasting
pan, and pour wine around it. Roast at 350 F. until turkey is golden,
basting every 30 minutes with pan liquids.  If the breast is browning
too quickly, cover it loosely with aluminum foil. After 2 hours, add
the onions and carrots to the pan, spacing them evenly around the
turkey. The turkey is done when the skin is golden, the thigh is
tender when pressed, and the leg joints move easily up and down in
their sockets, 3 to 3 1/2 hours more.

Remove turkey from the oven and from the roasting pan; let it rest
for at least 30 minutes or as long as 45 minutes before carving.
While it is resting, turn the turkey over so it is resting on its
breast. Prop the legs so they are slightly higher than the breast,
allowing juices to run back into the breast meat. Reduce the cooking
juices slightly over medium-high heat, about 2 minutes, scraping up
any brown bits. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Strain juices
and pour into a gravy boat.

Scoop out the stuffing into a serving dish and keep warm while you
carve the turkey.  Serve; pass the gravy boat.

Yield: 8 to 10 servings.

The stuffing is good for any poultry, and can be cooked on its own and
served as a side dish to pork roast as well. To cook the stuffing
separately, bake it in a covered dish at 350 F. until it is nearly
cooked all the way through, about 30 minutes.  Then remove the cover
and continue cooking until it has browned slightly on top and is
clearly cooked through, an additional 10 to 15 minutes.  If you cook
the stuffing separately, your turkey may take slightly less time to
cook.

Also good accompanied by either a red Burgundy or a Volnay.

Roasted Potatoes Buried In Sea Salt

vegetables, pork, potato

12 medium new potatoes
2 cup coarse sea salt or kosher  salt

Try using red new potatoes or small yellow potatoes in this dish,
burying them completely in the coarse sea salt or Kosher salt. The
results -- crisp skin and soft, buttery insides -- with just the
right amount of saltiness. The salt acts as a kind of "crust" without
overwhelming the potatoes. Brush the hot salt off the potatoes using
a pastry brush or your hands well wrapped in a pot holder.

With the potatoes serve any roast.

Directions:

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Place the potatoes in a medium-size roasting pan or ovenproof
skillet; do not crowd the pan. Pour the salt over the potatoes; there
should be enough salt so that only the very tops of the potatoes peek
through.

Roast the potatoes until tender, about 45-minutes. Brush the salt off
the potatoes before serving. Serve hot.

Robert Barnum's Spareribs

meats, pork

4  to 6 pounds meaty spareribs,
1  cut into individual ribs
1  grated zest of 2 limes
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
2 cup dry white wine, or water
1/4  cuyp light soy sauce
1  (usukuchi)
2  cloves garlic, peeled and
1  minced
1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 large sprig fresh rosemary, or 2
1  teaspoon crushed dried
2  limes, quartered, for
1  garnish

Arrange the spareribs in a single layer of a large non-reactive dish
(glass, stainless steel).  Whisk together all the ingredients through the
rosemary in a medium-size bowl, and pour this over the spareribs. Turn the
ribs so they are moistened on all sides, cover, and refrigerate for at
least 24 hours, turning them several times so they are evenly marinated.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, or build a good-sized fire in a
barbecue.

Drain the spareribs, reserving the marinade.  Place them in a non-reactive
baking pan in one layer (use two baking pans if necessary), and bake in the
center of the oven, basting frequently, until they are golden, crisp, and
cooked through, 55 minutes to 1 hour. Turn them occasionally to make sure
they cook evenly.

If you are using a charcoal grill, spread the coals out when they are red
and dusted with ash.  Lightly oil the grill rack, and place it about 3
inches above the coals.  Cook the ribs, basting and turning them, 55
minutes to 1 hour.

To serve the spareribs, drain off the fat and transfer them to a warmed
shallow serving bowl or platter.  Garnish with the lime wedges, and provide
plenty of napkins.

Roman Pie

main dish, meats, pasta

      ----FOR THE MEAT LAYERS----
1 pound cooked turkey or chicken *
1/4 pound cooked ham
1/4 pound cooked tongue
50 gm canned anchovy fillets
3/4 pound mushrooms
1 large bunch parsley
1  lemon juice
1  a few black olives
1  canned consomme **
      ----FOR THE PASTA LAYERS----
6 ounce macaroni
12 1/2 fl ounce milk
1/2 pint single cream
1 ounce butter
1 ounce plain flour
4 ounce Cheddar cheese
1 ounce Parmesan cheese

*Note: Weight given for turkey or chicken is skinned, boned weight. Goose,
pheasant and other birds can be used instead.

**Well-flavoured, clear stock and a little gelatine powder may be
substituted for canned consomme.

Make a smooth, rich sauce with the butter, flour, milk and cream. Let it
simmer for about 4 minutes.  Then, away from the heat, stir in the grated
Cheddar and Parmesan, a seasoning of nutmeg and some salt and pepper - but
go carefully with the salt in view of the cheeses and salted meats used in
this dish.  Let the sauce cool while you cook the macaroni in plenty of
salted water until al dente.  Plunge the pasta in cold water to arrest
cooking, drain well and stir it into the sauce.

Slice the mushrooms thickly and saute them well in a non-stick pan with no
fat.  Season them with about 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, plenty of pepper
and a little salt and allow to become cold.  Then cut the turkey meat into
pieces about the width and half the length of your little finger, and mix
the poultry and mushrooms together.

Cut the ham, tongue and drained anchovies into strips about the same length
as the poultry but considerably less wide.  Mix the anchovies, ham and
tongue with a good quantity of fairly coarsely chopped parsley.

Sprinkle about one third to half of the ham mixture over the base of a
shallow dish of 4 to 4-1/2 pint capacity.  Cover with half the macaroni
mixture, then all the turkey mixture, then the rest of the macaroni. Spread
each layer evenly and press down into the dish with a potato masher before
adding the next layer.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes.

Arrange the remaining ham mixture on top and scatter the olives to make a
decorative display of the pink, green and black ingredients. Press down
lightly then pour on enough barely melted consomme or cool jellied stock to
cover.

Cover the dish and refrigerate for a few hours until set.  Better still,
refrigerate Roman pie overnight to allow flavours to blend and mature, but
be sure to bring it back to room temperature at least two hours before
serving.

Salt Cured Ham

meats

2 pint salt
1  ham
      ----CURING PROCESS----

To salt down a ham you will again need a FRESH ham.
If at all possible, find some Jefferson Island Salt.
We have less trouble loosing hams when we use that.
If not, use canning salt -- DO NOT USE IODIZED SALT.
For each ham use two pints of salt.  Rub salt in well to all sides
of ham, filling bone cavity.
I suppose that I should have told you prior to
this that you have to have a salt box constructed of wood -- a very
strong salt box.  It may have to withstand the assault of
neighborhood dogs.
Box should be large enough to hold hams in a single layer. (Ours is
3'x5' on the bottom and about 2' high.) Size doesn't matter much as
long as hams don't butt up against each other and it's not so small
that the dogs can move it.      On to curing:  You will have salt
left after rubbing on hams. Place a thin layer of the salt in the
bottom of the box. Place ham on this, skin side down.  Pour the >>>
remaining salt on the ham. Place top on box and secure. Find a handy
calendar and mark down three weeks. Okay, ham comes up then. Wash
salt off ham and LIBERALLY coat with black pepper. (Use dust mask
from workshop if pepper bothers you.) Place in cloth sack (old pillow
case will do nicely) and hang. Do not cut for at least 6 months, 1
year is better.
All of this should be done when the temp is 35 to 50 degrees.
Good luck.  No guarantees.  (Sugar cure is better!)

Sate Babi (Pork Sate)

pork, indonesian

1/2 kg (1 1/4 pound) fillet  of pork
1 tablespoon melted pork fat or  butter
1  clove garlic, crushed
2 teaspoon dark soya sauce
2 teaspoon lemon juice
      ----MARINADE----
2 tablespoon clear soya sauce
2  cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon five spices
1 tablespoon clear honey
1/2 teaspoon white pepper

An important difference between this and other kinds of sates is that
we do not usually eat pork with peanut sauce. We eat it by itself, or
with Sambal Kecap.

Cut the pork into small thin squares and marinate for 2 hours. Push
on to bamboo or metal skewers.  Put these on a rack or in a roasting
tin and cook in a preheated oven at 350F (gas mark 4) for 30 minutes,
turning them over several times.

Mix the fat (or butter) with the crushed garlic, soya sauce and lemon
juice. just before serving, brush the sate with this soya and lemon
mixture, and grill for 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately.

Most readers will know that the 'five spices' used in this recipe are
a Chinese ingredient, the mixture being composed of star anise,
fennel, cloves, cinnamon and pepper.

Makes 4 servings.

Wipe piece of pork with a damp cloth, place in large stewing pan and
cover with cold water. Set over flame to cook slowly for one hour.
Add the sauerkraut and more water if necessary and continue cooking
for another hour or until meat has become thoroughly tender. Season
with salt and pepper. Serve with mashed potatoes. My notes: This is
basically the same way my mom and I prepare sauerkraut and spareribs,
but we add a chopped onion.  My mom also used to add some chopped
apple to cut down on the "sourness".  This is a really simple and
delicious meal, if you like sauerkraut. One of my favorites! Source:

Sausage & Mushroom Phyllo Twists

appetizers, meats, pork

1/2 pound pork sausage meat crumbled
1  minced small onion
1  minced garlic clove
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 pound mushroom chopped fine
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pinch of allspice
1/2 teaspoon dried crumbled mint
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley leaves
2 ounce cream cheese softened
16  12 inch sheets phyllo stacked betwe; en 2 sheets of wax
1  paper and covered with damp dish to; wel
1/4 cup clarified butter
2 tablespoon fine fresh bread crumbs

In a large skillet cook the sausage meat over moderately high heat,
stirring and breaking up any larger pieces, until it is cooked
through and browned.

Transfer meat to a fine sieve, and drain. In the skillet, cook the
onion and the garlic in the unsalted butter over moderately low heat
until the onion is softened. Add the mushrooms, and cook the mixture
over moderate heat, stirring until the liquid  the mushrooms give off
evaporates. Add the cumin, allspice and the mint and cook the
mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the sausage meat, the parsley,
cream cheese, and salt and pepper to taste, and combine the mixture
well. Working quickly to keep the phyllo from drying out, put 1 sheet
of phyllo on a work surface, brush lightly with some of the clarified
butter, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the bread crumbs. Lay
another sheet of phyllo on top of the first sheet and brush lightly
with some of the remaining clarified butter.

Cut the sheets into thirds lengthwise and into quarters crosswise to
form 12 squares. Put a rounded teaspoon of the filling in each
square, gather the corners of the phyllo over the filling, and twist
the phyllo gently to seal it. Continue to make hors d'oeuvres in the
same manner with the remaining phyllo, butter, crumbs and filling.
Bake the sausage and mushroom phyllo twists in jelly-roll pans in a
preheated oven at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes,or until phyllo is

Sausage & Pork Jambalaya

stew, pork, cajun

2 pound pork butt, cubed
3 pound sausage, sliced
1 can franco-American brown gravy
2  onions diced
1  bunch shallots diced
5 cup rice
1  water
      ----SEASONINGS----
1  salt
1  cayenne pepper
1  tiger sauce
1  hot sauce
1  tony's chachere's seasoning
1  kitchen bouquet

Contributed to the echo by: Stephen Brown This recipe for Jambalaya
comes from my father-in-law, who won the Oak Alley Jambalaya cooking
contest with it twice. Even this transplanted Yankee has had good
luck with it. Sausage and Pork Jambalaya

Brown the pork in a large pot with a small amount of water on the
bottom to prevent sticking. Cover, stir occasionally. Add Onions, and
continue to saute. When onions are transparent, add sausage, and
continue to saute. When the meats are cooked, add the brown gravy and
cook a few more minutes. Add the water -- You need to add an *equal*
amount of water as you are using rice. 5 Cups, in this case. (Usually
the rice is measured by the pound, in which case you would pour into
a bowl and add that amount of water). Allow the water to heat, then
turn off the heat and cover. Allow the grease to rise to the top.
Skim off the grease with a large spoon. Conserve the grease. After
skimming the grease, add an amount of water equal to the amount of
grease to replace the liquid lost. Bring to almost boiling, and add
your seasonings. You can use whatever seasonings you want, but the
key is that it should be saltier and hotter now than you want the
finished product. Heat the spices a few minutes, and taste. Add more
spices until you are happy with the outcome. At this point you can
add the shallots. (We save the greens until now, since they float,
and they would be in the way of tasting the spices). One optional
step is to add a small amount of Kitchen Bouquet to give the
Jambalaya a rich brown color. Bring to a rolling boil. Add the rice
all at once and stir. Continue with high heat and stirring often
until the mixture becomes milky with the rice. Reduce the heat
slightly, and cover. Now you only want to open and stir the rice
occasionally, as the rice is steaming. When removing the cover, do
not allow the water to drip back into the pot. Wipe the lid before
returning the lid to the pot. Stir quickly, but be sure to scrape the
bottom to prevent sticking. This is really the tricky part... As the
liquid drys up, you need to reduce the heat even further and allow
the rice to finish steaming. Stir every few minutes, scraping bottom.
The Jambalaya is finished when the rice is tender and "done."

This recipe can be increased or reduced proportionally. The first
time I made it I used 2 pounds of rice. The second time used 35
pounds!

Schlesisches Himmelreich (Silesian Pork)

pork, german

1 pound dried fruit (prunes, apricots, appl; es, pears)
4  fine pork chops or 1 pound lean por; teaks
2 ounce (4 tablespoon) lard or butter

You will need a medium-sized stewpan with a lid.  Soak the fruit for a
couple of hours - or overnight if possible - in either plain water or
cold tea which will give a darker, richer juice to cover.

Fry the chops in the fat, turning them once, so they take color. Add
the fruit and the soaking liquid. Cover and simmer all together for
30 to 35 minutes, or until the fruit is soft and the chops cooked
through.

Serve with potato dumplings.

Serves 4. Time: Start the day before; 10 minutes plus
35    minutes cooking.

Apples and buttons, this best-known of all Pennsylvania Dutch dishes
is called. Truly a meal in itself, it contains proteins, starch and
carbohydrates in a giant slab of ham surrounded by raised dumplings
and stewed apples.

To prepare, add apples and their liquid to ham and boil for one hour.
If dried apples are used, they should be soaked overnight first. Add
brown sugar. Prepare dumplings by sifting together flour, baking
powder, salt and pepper. Stir in well-beaten egg, butter and enough
milk to make a stiff but moist batter. Drop batter by large spoonfuls
into main dish, cover tightly and steam for about 20 minutes. Frozen
oven-ready yeast biscuits may be substituted for the dumpling batter.

Brown the pork and then cook it to the point of where it is half
done. Cut into slices, add the diced potatoes as well as the peeled
and diced apples, and stew in its own juices. Add a little water
whenever required.

This dish was considered a main course as it contains meat as well as
side dish items.

Schweineschnitzel

pork, german

4  (6-ounce) pork cutlets
1  salt and freshly ground pepper to t; aste
1  flour for dredging
1  egg
1 teaspoon water
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
4 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 tablespoon capers
1  lemon wedges

Pound the cutlets until thin.  Sprinkle lightly on both sides with
salt and pepper.  Dredge them lightly but thoroughly in flour.

Beat the egg lightly with the water and dip the floured cutlets in the
mixture; coat with crumbs. Using the side of a kitchen knife, tap the
cutlets lightly so the crumbs will adhere well to the meat. Transfer
them to a wire rack.  Refrigerate for one or two hours. This will
help the breading adhere to the cutlets when they are being cooked.

Heat the butter in a large skillet and, when it is hot but not brown
or smoking, saute the cutlets in it until they are golden brown on
both sides.

Arrange the cutlets on a heated serving platter and garnish with the
capers and lemon wedges.  Serve immediately.

Scrapple

pork, penn dutch

4 pound pork scraps with bones or 1 hog's h; ead, split
1 teaspoon salt
6  peppercorns
3  whole cloves
1  bay leaf
2 cup cornmeal
1  onion, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon or more ground sage
1  salt and freshly ground pepper

Here's a Pennsylvania Dutch version of scrapple. You'll probably have
better luck rounding up pork scraps than a pig's head, although you
could probably pick one up at an Asian or Latino market.

Parboil pork scraps or head, in water to cover, for 10 minutes. Drain;
discard water. return to pot with fresh water to cover, salt,
peppercorns, cloves and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer
for 3 hours, or until meat falls off the bones easily. Strain stock;
reserve. Remove all meat from bones and chop; set aside.

Reheat stock; gradually add cornmeal, stirring constantly until thick,
about 15 minutes.  Add meat, onion, cayenne, nutmeg and sage; adjust
seasonings with salt and pepper. Pour into 2 greased loaf pans.
Refrigerate until set.  Slice and fry for breakfast. Will keep in the
refrigerator for up to 1 week.

fine paste. This can be done in a blender or food processor, the
liquid egg substitute providing the moisture.

After the mixture has been made into paste, add the chopped onion,
coriander leaves and chillies.

Shanghai Dumplings - Chowza

pork, chinese

      ----WRAPPER----
2 cup flour
1/4 cup water; more or less; hot
      ----FILLING----
1 pound ground pork
1/2 teaspoon chinese 5 spice
1 each scallion; chopped
1 teaspoon light soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon szechuan peppercorns; toasted and crushed

A very simple and filling Shanghai staple.

Put flour in a food processer. Gradually add water (your mileage may
vary) while mixing until the dough forms into a ball. Roll out on a
floured surface to about 1/16" thick. Use a glass to cut into 3"
circles. Set wrappers aside.

Mix filling ingredients.

To assemble, put a wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place about 1
tablespoon of the filling in the wrapper and fold in half. Keep 1/4"
of the wrapper free of stuffing for a good seal. Moisten edge with
water. Crimp the edges together using your first 2 fingers and thumb,
fluting the edges. Go around in one direction, flip over, then
reverse. The idea is to seal them good! Cool in the 'fridge for at
least an hour.

Steam for 20 minutes; let cool.

Deep fry until golden brown. Serve hot.

Variations/notes: * Place each dumpling on a small piece of cabbage or
lettuce to
prevent sticking to the steamer rack. * Try boned pork steaks, fat
removed, ground in a food processor. * Also try shrimp, chicken, or a
combo of all. * Hot peppers, or pepper sauce, may be added to the
filling. * The steam/cool/fry technique is the only way it matches
the real
thing! But these are also good just steamed.  I usually do them
mixed.

Sauces: Chopped garlic and light soy sauce
:       Coleman's Dry Mustard mixed with cold water or light soy sauce
:       Sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds, and dark soy sauce
:       Hot pepper sauce of your choice

Makes about 16 dumplings.

Personal Note: When in Shanghai, I visited a restaurant that served
only dumplings, on Nanjing Lu. They had =so= many variations of
fillings and sauces; it was incredible. When I asked how the wrappers
were made, I was told just mix flour and water, nothing else.

Don't be deceived by the simplicity of this recipe. It's one of the
very best sweet and sour rib recipes I've run across as well as being
one of the easiest. The taste of the ribs shines through rather than
being overwhelmed as it often is with more complex sweet and sour
recipes.

Combine and sugar and water in a 2-quart stainless steel saucepan and
bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until the sugar
dissolves. Increase the heat to high and cook briskly, uncovered, for
5 minutes or until the syrup reaches 200F on a candy thermometer.
Reduce the heat to low, stir in the soy sauce, molasses, galangal,
cilantro, and pepper, and simmer for 3 minutes.  Remove from the
heat; let cool.

Strain the sauce through a fine sieve set over a bowl. Sauce will
keep at room temperature for 2 to 3 months if tightly covered.

Shiu Mai (Steamed Pork Dumplings)

pork

1 pkg round dumpling skins *
1/2 pound prawns
12  chinese mushrooms, small or  use ca; nned but squeeze dry
1/2 pound ground pork
2  green onion, finely chopped
1 small egg
      ----SEASONING----
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon sesame oi
2 teaspoon thin soy sauce
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Shell, devein, wash, and drain prawns.  Dice into bits.

Boil mushrooms in water for 10 minutes, rinse, squeeze dry, cut off
and discard stems; then chop into very small pieces.

Combine the pork, mushrooms, prawns, and onion.  Put mixture on
chopping board and chop 10 to 15 strokes with cleaver. (Use a sharp
knife if you don't have a cleaver.) Texture, when you're finished,
should be slightly finer than hamburger.

Add "seasoning" and the egg to the pork mixture.  Mix well.

To make dumpling, place 1 Tb filling in the center of a dumpling
skin. Then bring all sides of the skin up to cover the meat as much
as possible, without closing. The top of the dumpling is left open.

Cook dumplings by steaming for 30 minutes.  Use as many as you need,
with the rest, cool, wrap, freeze. Reheat after thawing by steaming
10 minutes.

Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, or mustard.

*  Dumpling skins are similar to won ton skins, except that they are
round and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by
merely cutting off the corners to round off the skin.

Sicilian-Style Sausage Patties

meats, pork, italian

2 pound fat-trimmed pork (or veal) shoulder; , ground
1/2 cup chianti wine
2  cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoon minced fresh (or 2 teaspoon. dried); e
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoon salt (or smoke flavored salt)
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1/4 teaspoon each: black pepper and red cayenne; pepper (or more to taste)

Note:  It's not necessary to stuff meat mixtures into sausage
casings. In fact, if you plan to barbecue, it's better to shape the
meat into flat hamburger-like sausage patties that fit in pita
pockets or on thin rounds of French or Italian Bread. To Make
Patties: Combine all ingredients and mix lightly. Shape into patties,
six per pound of meat. Raw patties may be frozen for later use;
Arrange them in a single layer on a cookie tin lined with aluminum
foil. Cover with foil, label and freeze. Patties may be barbecued or
broiled without defrosting. To Cook: Place patties 3 inches from heat
source and broil or barbecue for about two to three minutes per side
(three to four minutes each side if frozen); be sure meat is cooked
through.  Makes 12 patties, 130 calories each with pork; 100 calories
each with veal.

noodles in warm water for 15 minutes, then rinse and drain.

Stir-fry:  Add oil to hot wok; when it just begins to smoke, add pork
and ginger mixture.  Stir-fry 30 seconds. Add Szechuan mustard green;
stir- fry 2 minutes.

Soup:  In 2-quart saucepan, boil the water.  Add hot pork stir-fry;
simmer 3 minutes.  Five minutes before serving, bring broth to boil,

Simplified Smithfield Cure For Hams

meats, pork, preserves

1  pork leg (min 5 pounds) boned
1 pound white sea salt **
6 ounce saltpetre
1/2 pound granulated sugar
1  english brine

NB Use Tidman's or Maldon salt, not gros sel (US Kosher salt? IMH)
"Smithfield hams come from a small village in Virginia, and have nothing to
do with Smithfield Meat Market in London. They are famous for their mild,
sweet cure. This is the kind of ham to serve with pickled peaches, or
spiced apples, or pineapple, and here is a simplified method. JG"
Mix together the salt, sugar and saltpetre, and rub the boned leg with
it. Pay particular attention to the part of the leg which is not covered by
the skin, and where the bone came from. Leave the meat in the salt.
Next day do the same thing all over again, and the two days following.
Four days of dry cure in all.
Scrape off any salt that is still clinging, and put the leg into English
Brine for six or seven days. String it firmly into a neat tubular shape.
If you have a good drying place (cool, airy, the temperature between 50
and 60F, without violent fluctuations, no direct sunlight), squeeze the
ham of as much moisture as possible and hang it up in a boiled string bag,
for twenty days.
If you can't be sure of drying the ham properly, let it hang for several
days only.
Cook like a Jambon de Paris. (This ham can be smoked, but only to give it
a light golden colour.)

Slow Cooked Barbecued Spareribs

pork

3/4 cup ketchup
1/2 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoon hot sauce
1 medium onion, grated
3  garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1  rack of pork ribs, about 4 pounds
1  this is a pretty typical us barbecu; atment.

Combine the ketchup, vinegar, hot sauce, onion, garlic and
Worcestershire sauce in a mixing bowl and stir until blended. Pour
half of the sauce into a glass baking dish large enough to hold the
ribs in a single layer. Place the ribs meaty side down in the sauce.
Pour remaining sauce over; cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.

Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are thickly coated with ash. If
you are using a gas grill, preheat on low for 5 minutes with the lid
closed.

Place the ribs on a rack set at least 6 inches from the fire. Grill
slowly, for 15 minutes.  Turn and baste with sauce. Ribs should have
browned slightly. If they still look raw, stoke the fire. If they
have browned a great deal or scorched in spots, move ribs to a cooler
part of the fire. Cook for 15 minutes, baste, and turn again. Grill
for 30 to 45 minutes longer, turning and basting, every 5 minutes.
Watch the fire carefully, keeping flames away from the ribs.

To serve, slice the rack into individual ribs and pile on a heated
platter.

Serves 4.

Smoked Beef Roast & Pork Roast

pork, bbq, beef

20 pound beef roast
20  garlic cloves - whole
1  pickled
10  green onions - whole
1  water pan seasonings:
1 cup wine - dry, red or white
2  garlic cloves - whole
1 teaspoon mint - dried
6 drop peychaud's bitters
1  water
15 pound pork roast
20  cayenne peppers - fresh or
1  onion - whole
1 tablespoon liquid smoke
2 tablespoon parsley
2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Stick a knife into each roast in several places, making a deep
puncture. With fingers, push 1 clove garlic in each hole, then a long
pepper and a green onion. Slice the pepper and onion off even with
the surface of the meat.  Sprinkle the roasts with salt and red
pepper. When you get your fire going and are ready to put the meat on
the smoker cooker, place some pre-soaked smoking wood (such as pecan
or hickory) on the briquets. Place seasonings in water pan, then add
water all the way to the top of the pan. Place beef roast, then pork
roast, in cooker and let them cook. I usually put these on about 11
P.M. and let them cook while I sleep. One 10-pound bag of charcoal will
usually do.

GRAVY 1/2 cup flour (for roux) 1/4 cup oil (for roux) cold water
juice from smoker cooker

After making a small roux, add enough cold water to blend roux. Then
add as much juice from smoker cooker pan as you wish. It has all the
juice and the tasty fat from the meat that was cooked. Simmer,
stirring frequently, until gravy thickens slightly.  Serve over rice.

Smothered Pork Chops

pork, creole

2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon flour
1 1/2 cup rich beef broth
1 pinch sage leaves, crumbled
6  thick loin pork chops
1 cup flour for dredging
1  salt and pepper, to taste
1/2 cup lard
3 large onions, sliced
3  cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup celery, minced

We get recipes for Seoul food here but not many for soul food. A big
lack, I think as I love the stuff. The following four recipes are
from the California Culinary Academy over in the city and comprise a
soul food dinner.

No matter where they're served, smothered meat dishes are extremely
popular (and remarkably similar) throughout the South: chops heaped
high with sauteed onions and a spicy brown gravy. This
Mississippi/Louisiana recipe borrows several New Orleans Creole
techniques.

1.  In a small saucepan melt butter over medium-high heat, stir in
the 2 tablespoons flour, and cook, stirring constantly with a wire
whisk, until lightly browned. Stir in broth and sage, mix well,
remove from heat, and set aside.  This mixture will be the sauce.

2.  Add salt and pepper to the 1 cup flour; dredge chops in the
mixture. In a large, heavy skillet heat 1/4 cup of the lard over
medium- high heat. Add chops and cook until they are browned. Move
browned chops to a large, oven proof casserole with a cover. Preheat
oven to 350F.

3.  Melt the remaining lard in skillet over high heat. Add onions,
garlic, and celery; lower heat to medium, and cook, stirring
frequently to avoid burning, until onions are golden (about 8 to 10
minutes). Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and place over chops
in the casserole.

4.  Pour off all lard from the skillet.  Add reserved sauce, raise
heat to high, bring to a boil, and cook for 1 minute, stirring
vigorously and scraping the bottom of the skillet. Pour sauce over
chops in casserole, cover, and bake for 30 minutes.  Serve with
mashed potatoes.

Southern Maryland Stuffed Ham

pork

12 pound ham, country cured
3 pound kale
3 pound watercress
2 pound cabbage, green
1 bunch celery
1  pepper, hot red
6 tablespoon salt
5 tablespoon pepper, black
2 tablespoon pepper, red
2 tablespoon mustard seed
2 tablespoon celery seed
2 teaspoon Tabasco sauce

Choose a plump, thick ham with a thin layer of fat. Parboil 20
minutes. Steam and remove all skin.  Cut greens in small pieces (1"
to 1 1/2"). Chop celery and pepper fine. Blanch greens, celery and
pepper in boiling water until limp; drain well.  Add seasonings and
mix. Cool ham until you can handle it comfortably. Starting at the
butt end of the ham, cut three lengthwise slits, 2" long, all the way
through. Second row--two slits. Third row--three slits, so that one
slit for stuffing does not split into another. The ham is now ready
to be stuffed. With your fingers, push the seasoned greens into slits
first from the top, then from underneath, until you can feel all the
spaces have been filled. The remaining greens are banked over the top
of the ham.

To keep the ham in shape, use a large square of clean cloth. Place
ham, skin side up, on the cloth, fold the ends over tightly and pin.
Return to ham boiler and simmer 15 minutes to the pound. Let cool for
two hours in the pot liquor.  Chill in refrigerator overnight, in its
cloth.

Speckknoedel (Austrian Bacon Dumplings)

pork, german

6 slice slightly stale white bread
5 slice thick cut bacon
1/3 cup light cream
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon (heaping) caraway seeds
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
1  yolk of one large egg
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup sliced white onions
1/2 pound rinsed and drained sauerkraut
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

1.  Trim the bread slices and cut them into 1/2 inch cubes.

2.  Cut the bacon slices into 1/3 inch squares.  Saute them over
moderate heat in a large skillet for about 5 minutes. Stir
frequently. Transfer them to paper towels with a slotted spoon, and
pat dry.

3.  Pour water to a depth of 3 inches into a wide bottomed pot and
bring it to a simmer (in preparation for step 8).

4.  Brown the bread cubes in the hot bacon fat for 3 to 5 minutes.
Transfer them to a large bowl.

5.  Add the cream to the bowl.  Gently toss the bread until it
absorbs all the cream. Add to this mixture the bacon, flour, baking
powder, caraway seeds, thyme, pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt.
Beat the egg yolk and add it to the bowl.  Gently blend all the
ingredients.

6.  Shape the mixture into 1 1/4 inch spheres with your hands. (If
your mixture is too dry, moisten it with a little more cream.) Place
the dumplings on a plate as you make them, arranging them in one
layer so they do not touch each other.

7.  Melt the butter to moderate heat in a clean large skillet. Add the
onions and saute for 2 minutes. Add the sauerkraut and the remaining
salt and blend the mixture. Cover, and cook for 12 minutes.

8.  Cook the dumplings in the simmering water for about 10 minutes
(start this step as soon as you cover the onion-sauerkraut pan.) You
need not turn the dumplings as they will do that by themselves.

9.  Transfer the cooked 'speckknoedel' to a warm bowl and cover them
with the onion-sauerkraut mixture. Garnish with parsley and serve
immediately.

Serves 3 to 4.

(Note: The ingredient listing does not show any butter, but the
instructions do.  One Tbsp would do adequately, I would think. (And
back home, we would dust the onions with flour near the end of the
roasting period, and add a little stock, to have the sauerkraut in a
thin sort of gravy.  Karin.)

These bacon tarts can be made in two ways.  The dough base is always
the same, however, the topping is different.

Dough:

In a bowl, mix the flour and salt.  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in
half the lukewarm milk.  Form a well in the flour, and pour the yeast
mixture into this well. Dust the liquid with flour, and cover the
bowl. Let rest, in a warm spot, for 1/2 hour.  Then add the melted
butter and knead and beat the dough until it starts to form small
bubbles. Shape into rounds that are about half a finger's width
thickness and about 5 inches in diameter.  Tweak the edges of the
dough into a raised rim. Cover the dough circles with

A) egg yolk and then lightly press in the bacon and add the remainder
of the ingredients, OR

B) lard and then lightly press in the cracklings. Season with salt.

Bake at medium heat for 30 minutes.  Serve hot.

1/3 cup finely chopped onion
2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup water

1 large peach or 2 small-1 pound. total
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup sour cream

Source: Cooking For Two When Minutes Matter Working time: 20 min.
Cooking time: 40 min.

1. Trim pork of any excess fat. Combine salt, cinnamon, cloves, and
flour on a piece of wax paper. Press chops into mixture, coating them
on both sides.

2. In a 10-inch skillet with a nonstick surface brown chops in 1 1/2
Tbl. butter over medium heat, about 2 minutes on first side. Turn
chops and add onion to skillet around pork. Cook 2 minutes.

3. Sprinkle pork with sugar, then lemon juice. Spoon most of the
onion over the pork. Turn heat to low, add water around chops, cover
and simmer 40 minutes. Spoon pan juices over pork halfway through
cooking.

4. Peel peach(es) and slice thickly. Melt butter in a 7-inch skillet
and coat slices with butter to prevent darkening.

5. When pork is done, heat peach slices about 3 minutes, just until
hot. Place pork on a small platter and spoon pan juices on top.
Arrange peach slices in a row over chops and top with a dollop of
sour cream.

*Peaches are most readily available from June to September. Frozen
unsweetened peach slices are available through a longer season and
are a good substitute in this recipe. (Use about 10 peach slices.)

To do ahead: Prepare through Step 5 up to 20 minutes ahead. Cover and
leave at room temperature. Reheat pork and complete Step 5.

Note: When this dish is cooking it may smell overspiced at first, but
don't worry, the resulting flavor is subtle and pleasing.

florets. Peel stems and cut them into strips about one-fourth inch by
3 inches.

Heat wok or wide skillet over high heat and add sausage. Cook,
breaking the sausage up and stirring until sausage is browned. Pour
off all but about 1 tablespoon fat.  Add half the green onions, all
the ginger and garlic. Cook 1 minute.  Add soy sauce, broccoli
florets stems and hot red pepper flakes. Stir over highest heat for

this. Probably time consuming but enjoyable to make if you have the
time or the weather (who wants to be indoors cooking in the Summer?)
Don't make this for the creep who puts ketchup on everything.
Wouldn't it be annoying after spending so much time cooking someone
throws some unwanted condiment onto the food? Enjoy!!

1 large yellow onion
2  cloves garlic -- crushed
2 each jalapeno peppers -- chopped

1  salt and pepper
1  Tabasco (just a little)
1  water (add to desired
1  consistency)

Trim excess fat from chops; dice into bite-size chunks. Lightly saute.
Drain on paper towel; saute onion, garlic, and jalapeno in butter. Add
pork, onion, garlic, and jalapeno together in pot. Add black beans,
kidney beans, and stewed tomatoes.  Do not drain beans. Add 7 ounce
can of diced canned jalapeno.

I usually use a crock pot because the longer the chili simmers, the
better it is.  When done, the pork should be really tender. The pork
will also darken due to the black beans. Can serve in bowls as usual
or over white rice.

Spicy Pork Tenderloin With Leeks & Fennel

pork, chinese

1  pork and marinade:
1 1/2 pound pork tenderloin -- trimmed
2 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoon rice wine or sake
1 tablespoon garlic -- minced
2 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
1  vegetables and sauce:
1 1/2 pound fennel bulbs -- trimmed and
1  julienned
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup scallions -- chopped
3 tablespoon rice wine or sake
3 tablespoon chinese black vinegar or
1  Worcestershire
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 medium leeks, white and light green
1  parts -- julienned
2 tablespoon ginger -- minced
1 1/4 teaspoon chili paste

Pork:  Combine the pork, soy sauce, rice wine, garlic, honey and
sesame oil. Turn to coat, cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours
or up to 8 hours.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Drain the pork, reserving the
marinade. Heat the oil in a wok or on stick skillet over high heat.
Sear the meat to dark brown on all sides -- 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Roast the pork on a rack, basting it with the reserved marinade every
10 minutes, until the internal temperature registers 150 degrees --
30 to 35 minutes.

Transfer the meat to a cutting board and let it cool slightly. Cut it
into thin slices and set it aside.

Vegetables and sauce:  Meanwhile cook the fennel in boiling water
until it is barely tender -- 3 to 4 minutes. Drain the fennel,
refresh it under cold water, drain again and set it aside.

Combine the soy sauce, scallions, rice wine, vinegar and sugar. Wipe
the wok clean and reheat it.  Heat the oil. Stir fry the leeks,
ginger and chili paste until the leeks are soft -- about 1 1/2
minutes. Add the reserved fennel and toss.  Add the sauce mixture and
pork slices. Toss to coat and serve.

NOTES:

1.  The dish, unlike many Chinese style stir frys, reheats very well.
By the second day, the flavors will have married to create something
very special.

2. The original recipe calls for 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili paste. Cut
this back is you plan to reheat the dish; it heats up considerably
upon standing.

2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoon grated pared fresh ginger
1  root
1  clove garlic, crushed
1 1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable shortening or lard
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1  water
      ----BARBECUED PORK----
2  whole pork tenderloins,
1  about 12 ounces
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoon dry red wine
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoon red food coloring,
1  if desired
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1  clove garlic, crushed
1  green onion

NOTE: these buns are cooked in bamboo steamers which are available in
Chinese and specialty gourmet cookware stores. The round steamers can
be purchased in various sizes separately or in sets of two of three
tiers. For cooking, the covered steamer(s) is (are) placed over
boiling water in a wok or large saucepan.

The above is quoted directly from a section connected to the recipe.
This is my own note.  I do not like the flavor that a bamboo steamer
imparts to recipes; therefore, I bought an aluminum Chinese steamer.
1. Combine hoi sin sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce and sesame oil.
Chop pork and onions finely.

2. Heat vegetable oil in wok or fry pan over high heat. Stir-fry
ginger and garlic in the oil 1 minute. Stir in hoi sin mixture. Cook
and stir two minutes. Combine 1/2 cup of the water and the
cornstarch. Blend into hoi sin mixture.  Cook and stir until liquid
boils. Reduce heat to medium and simmer 2 minutes. Stir in pork and
onions. Remove from heat. Cool completely.

3. Combine flour, baking powder and salt in large bowl. Cut or rub in
shortening until mixture resembles bread crumbs. Combine remaining
3/4 cup of the water and the vinegar. Mix water-vinegar into flour
until dough sticks together.  Shape dough into ball. Knead on lightly
floured surface 6 or 8 times. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand
20 minutes. Uncover and knead 4 or 5 more times.  Divide dough into
12 equal portions.
Shape each portions into a smooth ball.

4. Roll each ball of dough on lightly floured surface into a circle 5
to 6 inches in diameter.  Brush around edges lightly with water.
Spoon a heaping tablespoon of pork mixture onto center of each
circle. Carefully pinch edges together to seal dough around filling.
Bring the two ends of dough over the seam and pinch together.

5. Cut waxed paper into twelve 5-inch squares.  Brush one side of
paper lightly with oil.  Place a bun, seam side down, on each square.

6.Place buns with paper in single layer on steamer rack over boiling
water. Cover and steam buns until done about 20 minutes.

Yield: 1 dozen

BARBECUED PORK:

1. Remove and discard fat from meat.

2. Combine soy sauce, wine, sugar, honey, food coloring, cinnamon,
garlic and onion in large bowl. Add pork, turning tenderloins to coat
completely. Cover and let stand at room temperature 1 hour or
refrigerate overnight, turning occasionally.

3. Drain pork, reserving marinade.  Place pork on wire rack over a
baking pan.

4. Bake in preheated 350 degree F. oven until done, about 45 minutes.
Turn and baste frequently during baking.

5. Remove pork from oven.  Cool.  Cut into diagonal slices.

Steamed Pork With Preserved Tianjin Vegetable

pork, chinese

1 pound pork butt, chopped fine
4  water chestnuts, coarsely chopped
1  green onion, minced
2 tablespoon preserved tianjin vegetable
1  marinade:
1 1/2 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon cornstarch

Fresh pork lends itself well to steaming, either cubed, sliced or
minced, and combined or topped with "flavoring" ingredients.

Preparation:  Mix marinade. In bowl, mix chopped pork, water chest-
nuts, 1/2 preserved vegetable, and marinade; mix together with your
fingers - it's faster.  Spread mixture on round 12" plate.  Sprinkle
with remaining preserved vegetable.  Refrigerate if working in ad-
vance.

Steaming:  Bring pork mixture to room temperature before steaming.
Bring water in steamer to rapid boil. Steam for about 20 minutes.
Sprinkle with chopped onions just before serving.

Steamed Spareribs With Black Bean Sauce (Dow

pork, chinese

1 pound spareribs
1  clove garlic, minced fine
2 tablespoon salted black beans
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon sherry

Here's a couple of simple, good recipes that use black bean sauce.
Just in case you don't know, these black beans are the Chinese
fermented black beans.  They're extremely salty++and should be rinsed
before use++ and have a very nice, savory taste that blends well with
many foods. Very common in Chinese markets and I've seen bottles of
ready prepared black bean sauce in supermarkets in the Oriental food
sections.  Just substitute the deep fried tofu cubes for the meat in
these recipes. One of these recipes is for pork spareribs and one for
prawns. They'll give you an idea of how the beans are combined with
the other ingredients to come up with the sauce.

Yield: 4 servings

Preparation:  Have butcher cut spareribs into 1-inch pieces. Trim off
fat. Place spareribs in a heat proof dish. Wash and rinse black beans
2 or 3 times, then mash them with garlic, ginger, soy sauce,
cornstarch and sherry.  Mix with spareribs.

Cooking:  Place heat proof dish on steaming rack in wok. Add water to
bottom of wok.  Cover.  Steam for
30    minutes.

Do-ahead notes: Do through preparation.

Comments:  Spareribs can be left in the steamer for 2 hours if dinner
is late.  Substitute bean sauce for salted black beans++and
abracadabra! Mein See Jing Pie Quat! (Steamed Spareribs in Bean
Sauce.)

Steamed Stuffed Bitter Melon

pork, chinese

      ----STUFFING----
1/2 pound pork, ground [i minced it with clea; vers. s.c.]
4  fresh water chestnuts, peeled and f; inely minced
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoon minced scallion
1 1/2 tablespoon shaoxing wine or dry sherry
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon thin soy sauce
1  egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 large bitter melons, about 3/4 to 1 pound
      ----SAUCE----
2 tablespoon peanut oil
2 teaspoon minced garlic
1 1/2 tablespoon fermented black beans
1 tablespoon shaoxing wine or dry sherry
3/4 cup chicken broth
1  salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 teaspoon co; ld chicken broth
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1  from ken hom's book, chinese techni; que.

Combine the stuffing ingredients in a large bowl.  Mix them
thoroughly. The hands are the best tool for this job.

Cut the bitter melon into 1-inch slices; discard the end pieces. With
a paring knife, trim out the insides. Lift them out. Stuff the cavity
of each slice with a generous spoonful of stuffing.

Arrange the stuffed pieces of vegetable on a plate and set the plate
on a trivet in a wok over enough hot water to come within 1 inch of
the plate. Cover the wok and steam the food for 20 minutes. Remove
the platter and trivet.

In a separate wok or pan, prepare the sauce.  First heat 2 tablespoons
peanut oil.  Add the garlic and fermented black beans, stir for a
minute, then add the Shaoxing wine, chicken stock and salt. Add the
liquid that results from the steaming of the melon.  Bring the
mixture to a boil. Thicken with the dissolved cornstarch and flavor
with sesame oil.

Pour the sauce over the bitter melons and serve.

Serves 2 as a main course.

NOTE:  Hom makes no mention of blanching although another bitter melon
recipe in another book *does* say that it will cut the bitterness.

shaking the pot frequently, just until the clams open.

Drain the clams. Remove clams from the shells, discarding any shells
that have not opened.  Mince the clams. Rinse and dry 18 half shells.

In a mixing bowl, combine clams and all the remaining ingredients. Mix
well, and toss the mixture lightly against the inside of the bowl to
combine and compact it.

With a spoon dipped in cold water, stuff the reserved shells with this
mixture, mounding it and smoothing it. Arrange clams on a tray in a
steamer for 20 minutes.

Stir Fried Pork Mixture For Chow Or Lo Mein

pork

4  dried black mushrooms
1/2 pound lean pork
3  celery stalks
1  onion
2  scallion stalks
2 tablespoon oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup stock

1. soak dried mushrooms 2. Slice pork thin or cut in strips. Slice
celery, onion and soaked mushrooms.
Cut scallion stalks in 1 inch pieces. 3. Heat oil.
Add salt, then scallions, and stir-fry until translucent.
Add pork; stir-fry until it loses its pinkness (2 to 3 minutes).
Then sprinkle with soy sauce and sugar and blend in. 4. Add celery,
onion, and mushrooms; stir-fry 2 minutes more. 5. Add stock and heat
quickly. Cook, uncovered, another 2 to 3 minutes over medium heat.
then combine with Soft-fried or tossed noodles, as indicated below.

VARIATIONS: Shred the pork and vegetables.  Omit the stock and
additional cooking in step 5.

Chinese noodles are distinguised not only by their constituents but
by the way they're prepared. The noodles can be cooked, mixed,
blended, and combined with just about every variety of meat, seafood,
and vegetable. They can be added to soup, either alone, or with
various toppings..etc etc

LO MEIN means "tossed or mixed noodles" and calls for parboiled
noodles (also previously drained dry and chilled) to be added, not to
the hot oil and soft- fried as in CHOW MEIN, but directly to the meat
and vegetable combinations, which have already been stir-fried. These
noodles, tossed or mixed and heated through with the cooked
combinations, are moister, having more of a sauce than the CHOW MEIN.

Stir Fried Pork Slices In Wine Sauce

pork

1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar
3  cloves garlic -- minced
2 tablespoon sherry
2  egg yolks
3/4 cup chicken stock
1 teaspoon water
1  cornstarch paste
1 cup bread crumbs -- plain
1 1/2 pound pork loin -- boneless
3 tablespoon peanut oil
      PASTE-----
2 tablespoon cooked rice
2 tablespoon soy sauce -- dark
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon warm water
1 teaspoon baker's yeast -- dry
1 teaspoon wet bean cheese

Prepare Paste:  Use mortar and pestle to pulverize cooked rice.
Combine with sugar, yeast, soy and warm water. Let stand in warm
place for 30 minutes to activate yeast. Authentic wine lees paste is
not available in the U.S. to our knowledge, this is the best
substitute we have found. You can add wet bean cheese for a sharper
flavor.

Braise Pork:  Slice pork butt across the grain into strips, 1" by 3"
by 1/2" thick. Heat peanut oil in wok until it begins to smoke. Add
some of pork to hot oil; stir-fry pieces until they lose their
pinkness; repeat in batches until all pork is browned.  Next, add
garlic to wok; stir briefly. Pour in wine lees paste, rice vinegar,
sherry and stock; bring to slow boil; add pork slices. Reduce heat,
cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Remove pork, without sauce, to large platter.  Cool pork. Cooling is
essential so that it will deep-fry properly. Reserve sauce in small
pan. You can hold pork for several hours, if you wish to braise it in
advance.

Deep-fry Pork:  Heat deep-frying oil in wok.  While oil is heating,
beat egg yolks with water; set out bread crumbs on platter. Dip pork
pieces in egg mixture, then bread crumbs, to thoroughly cover.

When oil is at deep-frying temperature, 375 degrees, slip in a slice
of pork as a test: pork should lightly brown in about 1 minute. Place
6 pork slices on Chinese strainer, and lower into oil, strainer and
all. Check in 2 minutes (browning should take slightly longer than
test because strainer cools the oil). If you prefer to fry in larger
batches, use more oil. Remove fried pork to warm platter, uncovered.

Finish:  Reheat sauce, and pour over pork just before serving.

Stir-Fried Pork & Asparagus With Fish Sauce

pork, chinese

1/4 pound boneless pork butt
12 medium asparagus spears
1/2 teaspoon fresh ginger root, minced
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1/3 cup chicken stock
1 pinch sugar
1 teaspoon fish sauce (or
2 teaspoon oyster sauce
1  thin cornstarch paste

This is a basic stir-fried vegetable and meat dish. Adding just a
touch of fish sauce lends an interesting dimension to the taste.

Preparation: Slice pork butt (or comparable boneless pork) across the
grain into strips 2" by 1/4" by 1/8" thick. Wash and trim tough white
skin from asparagus. Cut asparagus into 2 1/2" segments. If asparagus
is thick (3/4" or more), cut on bias so it will cook quickly and be
balanced in size with pork strips.

Stir-frying:  Heat peanut oil in wok until it just begins to smoke.
Add pork strips and stir-fry about 1 minute until no longer pink. Add
asparagus and stir-fry briskly for another minute. Before asparagus
turns bright green, add ginger, chicken stock and sugar; keep stir-
ring. When liquid boils, reduce heat to medium, add fish sauce (not
oyster sauce, though), cover and simmer for about 1 minute or until
asparagus is cooked but still firm.  Uncover, turn up heat, and push
ingredients out of liquid. Dribble in cornstarch paste, stirring
continuously until liquid thickens. You may need 1 to 2 teaspoon of paste.
Recombine ingredients. Serve.

2 tablespoon butter
1 cup mushrooms, chopped
1 small Italian sausage
2 tablespoon parsley, chopped fine
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1  egg yolk, beaten
2  bacon slices
1/4 cup dry white wine

1. Preheat the oven to 375. 2. Lay the pork tenderloin on chopping
board and trim off almost all the fat. Score 2 vertical lines down
the lenght of it, taking care not to pierce through the meat. Place

string. 6. Place the roll on a sheet of foil and dot the remaining
butter on top. Wrap the foil around the pork roll and set on a baking
sheet. 7. Cook for 30 min. Remove the foil, baste the pork with the
cooking juices and cook for a further 10 min. 8. Remove and discard

Sugar Cured Ham

meats

1 pint jefferson island salt or can
2 tablespoon black pepper
1 tablespoon ground red pepper

We raise hogs and salt or sugar cure our hams and bacon. You will need
FRESH hams, preferably from a salughter house as these are fresher
than those available at grocery stores. You will need the above
ingredients FOR EACH JOINT (local name for ham or shoulder.) To cure
two hams, double the ingredients. Mix all above and rub well into
meat, filling hole in end of the bone.  Wrap in brown paper and place
in a cloth sack. Hang hock (small end) down. Time will cure it.
Additional details: Should be hung in a cool (around 40 degrees)
place.  That's why before refrigeration hogs were only killed in the
winter.
If you are curing without refrigeration, try to do it when the
temperature will remain from 35 to 50 degrees for at least the first
three days. After that it's okay if it goes up or down more. You can
hang the meat in an old refrigerator to cure it or if you are curing
outside and the temp goes haywire, you can move it to the refrig.
Needless to day, if you are hanging the meat in an out building or
garage, hang it high enough to keep it out of the reach of dogs.
They do love fresh ham. The ham should hang for at least 6 month (I
prefer a year) before being cut. If you want to smoke the ham, it is
best to wait about three months from hanging before doing it.
Be aware that you may loose a ham.  By that I do not mean that
someone will steal it, though, I suppose that is possible. I mean
that it may ruin. That's one of the chances you take. We've lost a
few but most of them have been salted down rather than sugar cured.
It is possible to sugar cure bacon in your refrigerator using Morton
Sugar Cure (using recipe on bag) and then smoke it. It's GREAT! Much
better than what you buy in the store. Yes, I can just hear all the
health food people groaning at all this talk of ham and bacon and
smoke. Ah, cholesteral (sp?) and salt and cancer causing smoke! May
not be good for you but 99.9% of all taste buds will vote for it!

Summer Sausage (Beef Stick)

pork, beef

6 pound beef chuck; including about 1 pound f
1  *4 pound pork, pre-frozen or certif; including about 1/2 pound
5 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon pepper, white
2 teaspoon coriander seed; crushed
1 tablespoon peppercorns, black
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 cup wine, red, dry
1/4 teaspoon ascorbic acid
1 teaspoon saltpeter
4  feet beef casings; large (3 1/2 to 4 diamete
      ----FLAVOURING SOLUTION----
1/4 cup ; water
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon wine vinegar, white
1 tablespoon maple flavoring
1/2 teaspoon cloves, ground
1 teaspoon lemon extract

Rinse casings and soak in tepid water 1 hour.

Grind the beef through the fine disk twice, chilling it between
grindings. Grind the pork through the fine blade once and mix it with
the beef.

Make the flavouring solution:  bring the water to a boil and stir in
the

sugar until it is dissolved.  Reduce the heat so that the liquid is
barely simmering and add the remaining ingredients. Turn off the heat
and allow the mixture to cool.

Mix the flavouring solution and all the remaining ingredients into the
meat.

Cure the sausage in the refrigerator for twenty-four hours. Stuff the
meat into the casings and tie off into six-inch or eight-inch links.

Smoke the sausage with a cool (80-90 F) smoke for about twelve hours.

Increase the smoke temperature to about 120 F and continue to smoke
for abut four or five more hours, or until the sausage is firm.

Let the sausage hang in a cool place at least two weeks before eating.

* Pork to be consumed raw, as in dried sausage, can be made
completely safe and free of trichinae by freezing it to -20 F for six
to twelve days. -10 F for ten to twenty days or 5 F for twenty to
thirty days. These guidelines have been set by the USDA for
commercial packers and are perfectly safe if followed by the home
sausage maker.

If you can't or don't wish to tie up freezer space to treat your own
sausage meat, you can ask your butcher to order you some "certified"
pork. Certified pork has been frozen to render it trichinosis free
and comes stamped or labeled as such.  Make sure you see the stamp or
label.

Surbraten (Corned Pork)

pork, german

1 kg pork (2 pounds 3 ounce)
2  onions, finely chopped
10  juniper berries [crushed?]
1 large or 2 small cloves garlic, chopped
1  brine:
1 liter water (4 1/4 cups)
2 tablespoon (approx.) salt

as much saltpeter as fits on the tip of a knife (optional)

Rub the meat with the chopped onion, garlic and juniper berries, then
push into a [tight-fitting] container and pour the cold brine (that
has previously been brought to a boil and then let cool again), with
or without saltpeter, over the meat.  Press down with a board and
weight it with a rock.  The meat has to remain in the brine for three
weeks, during which time it must be turned frequently. At the end of
the three weeks, remove the meat from the crock, briefly rinse it
off. Roast at 390 degrees F in hot lard, along with the chopped
onion, garlic and yellow turnip, until crispy, about 1 1/2 hours.

Serves 4.

pies, pork, canadian

      ----EGG GLAZE----
1  egg; beaten lightly
1 tablespoon ; water
      ----FILLING----
1 large onion; chopped
3 tablespoon oil
1  garlic clove; minced
1 1/2 pound pork, raw; trimmed of fat & minced o
1 cup pork gravy
1 pound potato; boiled, peeled & chopped
1 tablespoon celery leaves; chopped (opt)
2 tablespoon parsley; chopped
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon rosemary or savory
1/8 teaspoon allspice, ground
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon cloves, ground
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1 teaspoon salt; or to taste

Roll out half the dough from the Butter-Lard Pastry on a lightly
floured surface to 1/8 inch thickness. Fold in quarters, lift, and
position in a pie plate. Trim a 1/2 inch overhang, brush with the egg
glaze, then refrigerate the pastry-lined pan while you prepare the
filling.

In a frying pan, saute the onion in the oil until transparent. Add the
garlic and saute 1 minute, then add the minced pork. Saute about 3
minutes, then add the veal (if you are using it) and saute until the
meats are browned. Break up any clumps with a wooden spoon. Add about
1/2 cup stock, cover the pan, and simmer about 15 minutes to cook the
meat through. Uncover the frying pan and check the liquid. Remove all
but 2 or 3 tablespoon. of the meat juice and stock. Add the potatoes,
celery leaves, parsley, herbs and spices, and stir to blend. Add
salt, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Add, if necessary, just enough
additional gravy or stock to moisten the mixture well without making
it watery.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared pastry shell. Brush some egg
glaze on the overhang of the lower crust. Roll out the top crust on a
lightly floured surface, fold in quarters, lift, and position it over
the pie. Trim a 3/4 inch overhang, then fold the top edge under the
bottom crust overhang and pinch the two together to seal, making a
raised rim all around. Flute the edge as desired.

Bake in the lower third of a preheated 425-degree oven for 15 minutes.
Reduce the heat to 350 degress, raise the pie to the center of the
oven, and continue baking about 45 to 55 minutes longer until golden
brown. Check halfway through the baking time and add a foil edging to
protect the crust from overbrowning if necessary. Cool slightly on a
wire rack, then serve hot or warm.

Sweet & Sour Pork (Goo Lo Yuke)

pork, chinese

1 pound pork butt cut into 1-inch pieces
      ----MEAT MARINADE----
1 tablespoon sherry
2 tablespoon water
2 tablespoon kikkoman soy sauce
4 teaspoon flour
4 teaspoon cornstarch
1  green pepper, cut into 1/2 inch chu; nks
1  onion, cut into wedges
12  maraschino cherries
1 cup canned lichee
1 cup pineapple chunks
      ----SAUCE MIXTURE----
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon catsup
3/4 cup pineapple juice
4 teaspoon cornstarch

Had a house guest last week++an old friend who likes my Chinese
cooking, but tends to prefer the tamer stuff++you know, things
without tentacles or feet.  So I whipped up a batch of this
excellent, quick and easy sweet and sour pork.  It's a long time
favorite that I haven't cooked for a some time.  Been too busy with
Thai and Vietnamese food to make it. It was just as excellent as I
remember it being and I actually improved on it with a couple of
substitutions.

I used 1/2 cup palm sugar instead of 1/2 cup brown sugar. Palm sugar
has a rich, complex and addicting taste while being a little less
cloyingly sweet than regular sugars. It gives a taste that's "exotic"
without being obvious.  Where the recipe calls for 3/4 cup pineapple
juice I used 3/4 cup of the juice from some brandied peaches I made.
I made 'em months ago and froze the leftover juice specifically to
use in a sweet and sour dish. (This is a good thing to do with any
sweet fruity type juice.)

I left out the maraschino cherries++bleechhhhh!++and substituted a
red bell pepper for the color contrast. The only thing even faintly
exotic in the recipe is the canned lichees (also a good juice to save
for sweet and sour stuff) and that can be omitted if you can't find
them++or use canned apricots or whatever instead. You could also use
longans or rambutans, which are close relatives of lichee, quite
successfully.

Yield: 6 servings

PREPARATION:  Drain fruits, prepare sauce mixture. Marinate pork in
meat marinade for 1/2 hour.

COOKING:  Deep fry pork cubes in a wok for about 3 to 4 minutes until
golden brown.  Drain.  Pour all the oil back into the bottle. Add
sauce mixture into wok and stir until thickened. Add green pepper and
onions and cook for 2 minutes.  Add pork cubes and stir until heated
through. Add fruits and stir until they're coated with the sauce.

DO-AHEAD NOTES:  Cook through making the sauce.  Just before serving,
add pork, vegetables and fruit according to directions.

Sweet & Sour Pork (Tiem Shuen Gee Yok)

fruits, vegetables, pork, chinese

1 pound pork fillet
1 tablespoon rice wine
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 small carrot
1 large green pepper
2 slice canned pineapple
4  chinese dried mushrooms
1 centiliter garlic
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup water
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon salt
5 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon dried chili pepper
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
1  oil for deep frying
2 tablespoon oil

PREPARATION:

Cut pork into 3/4-inch cubes.  Mix the sherry and 1 tablespoon soy
sauce together, and add to the pork. With your fingers rub the
mixture into meat. Still using your fingers, roll the cubes in about
1/2 cup cornstarch until thoroughly dredged but not too thickly
covered. (The fineness of the end result of this recipe depends on
the meat's being crisp -- never soggy.) Cut the carrot on the
diagonal into 1/4-inch slices. Cut the green pepper in half; remove
seeds and cut into 1-inch squares. Cut the pineapple slices into
1/2-inch wedges. Wash the Chinese mushrooms and soak in warm water
for 30 minutes.  Drain, remove stems. Cut into 1/2-inch strips.
Smash, peel, and mince garlic. Combine garlic, carrots, green pepper,
pineapple, and mushrooms.  Combine vinegar, 1/2 cup water, black
pepper, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, salt, sugar, and chili pepper. In a
cup, mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water.

COOKING:

Heat oil in deep fry pan to 375-degrees.  Cook pork cubes a few at a
time until very light brown, about 5 minutes. Stir with a chopstick
occasionally so that the cubes do not touch each other. Drain on
paper towels, and keep hot in low oven (200-degrees). Repeat this
process, cooking pork in hot oil until cubes float and are golden
brown -- 2 to 3 minutes. (This double cooking insures that the meat
will be crisp.) Heat the water-vinegar mixture in small saucepan. In
a medium-sized skillet or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of oil at high
heat.  Add vegetable-pineapple mixture and stir-fry for 4 minutes.
Add the hot water-vinegar mixture to the vegetables and stir well.
Add the cornstarch mixture, and cook and stir until thickened, about
1 minute. Pour sauce over pork cubes and mix.

water just to the top of the meat. Add two teaspoons salt and 1/2
teaspoon pepper and raisins. Cover and bring to a boil over high
heat. Reduce heat to moderately low and simmer about two hours, or
until meat is very tender.

Strain stock into a container for use in the dough. When meat is cool
enough to handle, shred with a fork or fingers. Puree onion, garlic,
tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, shiles and jalapeno in a blender or
processor.

Heat lard in a skillet over moderate heat.  Add puree, 1/2 tablespoon
salt, bay leaf, and sugar and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring
constantly. Mix puree with the shredded meat and raisins. Taste and
add additional salt, pepper, or jalapenos if desired. Makes about
five cups.

Dough:  In a small, straight-sided mixing bowl beat the lard with an
electric mixer, processor, or fork until it is light and fluffy. On a
piece of wax paper mix masa with salt and baking powder and beat into
lard, adding about 1/4 of the mixture at a time.  When well mixed,
beat in stock 1/4 cup at a time to make a slightly mushy, but not
watery, dough.

Construction:  Put shucks in a large bowl, cover with very hot water,
and let soak for at least 1-1/2 to two hours, until soft and pliable.
If using packaged shucks, separate them after a few minutes of
soaking to make sure each one is in contact with the water. Before
using, shake excess water from the softened shucks. Wet your hands.
For each tamale spread about two tablespoons of the dough into a
rectangle on the inside of a shuck; spread to within 3/4 inch of the
edges and leave about three inches at the pointed end and 1-1/2
inches at the wide end of the shuck. Spread 1-1/2 to two tablespoons
filling lengthwise down the center of the dough. Fold over ends of
shucks so that dough completely covers filling. Arrange tamales
upright in steamer with folded wide ends down.

To cook tamales, fill the bottom of a steamer with water to a depth of
about one inch.  If desired, line steamer basket with additional corn
shucks.  Pack wrapped tamales upright in basket with the broad ends
of the shucks down.  When steamer is full, cover tamales with
additional shucks or a clean dish towel to prevent condensation from
soaking them. Cover pot tightly and bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce heat to moderately low and steam one to 1-1/2 hours. Add water
as necessary. Unwrap a tamale, and if dough comes away from the shuck
easily, tamales are cooked. Tightly covered, tamales may be kept
several days in the refrigerator, or they may be frozen for several
weeks. Reheat, covered, in a 300 F. oven.

Yield: 48 tamales

Thai Ham & Chicken Salad

      ----DRESSINGS----
1/2  chinese cabbage, shredded
2  carrots, grated
1  capsicum pepper, cut into
1  thin strips
2/3 pound cooked chicken meat,
1  shredded
3 1/2 ounce ham, finely sliced
1  birdseye chilli, finely
1  chopped
2 centiliter garlic crushed
2 tablespoon lime (or lemon), juice
2 tablespoon dark soya sauce
1/2 cup flaked almonds, lightly toasted

Bring a large pot of water to the boil and have ready a sink full
of icey-cold water. Plunge the shredded cabbage into the boiling
water for one minute then scoop it out and into the cold water.

Drain and dry the cabbage and arrange it and the other vegetables
in sections or concentric rings for maximum decorative value on a
large serving dish. Fill the centre of the arrangement with chicken
and ham. Decorate the dish with bright red chilli "flowers"
(optional). Pass the dressing separately.

From "Raw Materials" by Meryl Constance, Sydney Morning Herald,
12/22/92.

[The chilli "flowers" can be easily made by slitting long, thin,
hot chillies lengthwise from near where the stem attaches and then
tossing the slit chillies into a bowl of ice water and ice cubes. The
"petals" will curl back and make an attractive garnish. Make about
eight slits. S.C.]

The Fragrance Of Pork (Tungpo Pork)

pork, chinese

1 1/4 pound belly pork in one piece
2  level tablespoons salt
2 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon wine
2  spring onions (scallions)
2 slice ginger

The following passage is from "Chinese Gastronomy", one of the best
books on Chinese cuisine I've ever seen. It beautifully expresses the
nearly metaphysical regard that the Chinese have for food and eating
and is delightful reading even if you never cook a single recipe from
it. This dish is incredibly good, considering that its main
ingredients are pork fat and skin.  The fat is not something to be
gotten rid of in this case. It's treasured for what it is. Like I
said, this is something that I don't cook often but it's a special
occasion when I do.

This is one of my all time favorites.  I serve it with a bowl of
Chinese mustard and a bowl of chopped green onions for dipping.

At one time the butcher shops of Soochow were variously called Genuine
Straw Mat, Original Straw Mat, Old Straw Mat, etc., just because
there is a story about an Immortal in disguise who flung a bit of mat
into a pot of belly pork to give it a special fragrance. The
fragrance is easy enough to produce. What is important is that it
stands out in a clear field. Instead of being heavy, the pork should
appear light; clean instead of messy; smooth instead of lumpy. The
flavour of pork is effusive. While the cooking of chicken and beef
means the careful carving out of its best flavour from the raw
material, the flavours of pork must be restrained. At its best, pork
is tender, sweet, fragrant, tasty, rich without being oily (in other
words, nun, hsien, hsiang, nung, yu-er-pu-ni).

A geometrically precise square of belly pork is stewed and then
steamed in a little sauce, so that it is served with an absolutely
clear layer of melted fat overlying a smooth brown sauce. The surface
is a rich brown colour, the fat smooth and custard-like, the meat
brown and tender. The square of fat was named after Su Tungpo, the
poet, for unknown reasons. Perhaps it is just because he would have
like it.  The square of fat is regarded with much passion, tenderness
and expectation.

Second-rate versions of it appear everywhere, differing from the
following version by their failure to clear the field for the
delicacy of the pork fat which, if prepared accordingly, tastes fresh
and clean like fresh (sweet) butter.  In order to keep the flavour
clear, the meat is first salted to remove the bloody juices, blanched
to remove the scum, then stewed very slowly, and finally steamed for
hours to tenderize the fat slowly.  Inferior versions this are made
by stewing pork for a few hours without steaming it... The result is
lumpy fat. If the salt rub and blanching are omitted the juice
becomes messy and lumpy. The simplicity of appearance, smoothness and
clarity of flavour have to be wrested from the manifold flavours of
pork.

Tungpo Pork is customarily served at the end of a meal with bowls of
rice. People sigh, shout and groan with happiness when they see it.

This is one of the pinnacles of gastronomy, and sums up the
application of fat in Chinese cuisine.

Trim pork into a precise square.  Wash it and wipe it dry with a
towel. Rub it with salt and let it stand for about 2 hours. Discard
the blood-tinged liquid.

Bring 5 pints (12 cups) water to a boil and blanch the meat in it.
Rinse it free of scum and repeat the blanching with a fresh portion
of boiling water. Place the pork skin side up in a pot with a
tight-fitting lid, adding soy sauce, wine, spring onions ginger and 2
tablespoons water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to very
low and simmer for 2 hours, adding a little more water if necessary.
Keep the amount of liquid as small as possible, and do not keep
uncovering the pot to see how the pork is progressing.  Let it stew
in its own juices.

Discard the spring onions and ginger.  Place the square skin side
down on a dish of soup plate dimensions, add the juices and cover it
very closely with foil, cellophane or an overlapping plate.  Steam it
for 4 hours, until the fat is tender and can be cut with a spoon.
Invert the square so that the fat is uppermost, and pour the juices
around it carefully.

Tiem Shuen Gee Yok (Sweet & Sour Pork)

pork

1 pound pork fillet
1 tablespoon rice wine
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 small carrot
1 large green pepper
2 slice canned pineapple
4  chinese dried mushrooms
1 centiliter garlic
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup water
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon salt
5 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon dried chili pepper
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
1  oil for deep frying
2 tablespoon oil

PREPARATION:

Cut pork into 3/4-inch cubes.  Mix the sherry and 1 tablespoon soy
sauce together, and add to the pork. With your fingers rub the
mixture into meat. Still using your fingers, roll the cubes in about
1/2 cup cornstarch until thoroughly dredged but not too thickly
covered. (The fineness of the end result of this recipe depends on
the meat's being crisp -- never soggy.) Cut the carrot on the
diagonal into 1/4-inch slices. Cut the green pepper in half; remove
seeds and cut into 1-inch squares. Cut the pineapple slices into
1/2-inch wedges. Wash the Chinese mushrooms and soak in warm water
for 30 minutes.  Drain, remove stems. Cut into 1/2-inch strips.
Smash, peel, and mince garlic. Combine garlic, carrots, green pepper,
pineapple, and mushrooms.  Combine vinegar, 1/2 cup water, black
pepper, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, salt, sugar, and chili pepper. In a
cup, mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water.

COOKING:

Heat oil in deep fry pan to 375-degrees.  Cook pork cubes a few at a
time until very light brown, about 5 minutes. Stir with a chopstick
occasionally so that the cubes do not touch each other. Drain on
paper towels, and keep hot in low oven (200-degrees). Repeat this
process, cooking pork in hot oil until cubes float and are golden
brown -- 2 to 3 minutes. (This double cooking insures that the meat
will be crisp.) Heat the water-vinegar mixture in small saucepan. In
a medium-sized skillet or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of oil at high
heat.  Add vegetable-pineapple mixture and stir-fry for 4 minutes.
Add the hot water-vinegar mixture to the vegetables and stir well.
Add the cornstarch mixture, and cook and stir until thickened, about
1 minute. Pour sauce over pork cubes and mix.

To Cure Hams

makemeat, pork, penn dutch, preserving

100 pound ham
1 pint salt, kosher
1 single *also:
1/8 pound pepper
3 ounce salt peter
1/2 pound brown sugar
2 pint salt

*** The "recipe" specifies ham from corn-fed hogs, and "fine salt (best
quality)". Since kosher salt is commonly available today, and contains no
iodine, I changed the ingredients to specify it.
Mix thoroughly the salt peter, 1 pint salt and brown sugar and rub over the
hams and let stand for 24 hours. Then rub the meat with the pepper and part
of the remaining salt. Let stand for 5 days and then rub meat again with
fine salt. Set aside for 30 days, hang the meat up and brush off the salt.
Have hams smoked at a good smoke house, smoking them for 10 days with wood.
When finished, rub entire ham with red pepper, wrap carefully in brown
paper and then in muslin bags and hang up with the hock down. Hams prepared
in this manner will keep indefinitely, and flavor and quality improve with
time.

Tortire Quebecoise

meats, pies, pork, beef

1/2 pound pork - lean
1/2 pound beef - lean
1/2 pound veal
1/2 pound chicken
1/4 pound salt pork fat
1  salt
1  pepper
1  onion
2 1/2 pound potatoes
1  thick pie shell
      ----SUET PASTRY----
1/2 pound suet, finely minced
4 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/3 cup water (approx)

At night prepare the meat by cutting the pork, veal, beef, chicken
and pork fat into small cubes. Season with salt, pepper and onion cut
in rings. Cover and put in a cool, fresh place. The next morning, cut
the potatoes in small cubes. Roll suet pastry into a 28xd4x1/2-inch
strip. Cut lengthwise into halves. Line a 10-inch three-quart
casserole (or two smaller casseroles) with one strip, bringing pastry
over top edge. fill pastry with alternate layers of meat and potatoes
until all ingredients are used. Cover all with boiling water and seal
pie with top layer of pie shell. Cut hole in centre of pie shell to
let steam escape. Cover casserole with foil. Bake in moderate oven
(350F) for four hours. Remove the foil for the last 30 minutes of
baking time to brown the crust. The original recipe of the Naskapis
(native Indians of Quebec) called for one rabbit, a partridge, one

1 tablespoon spring onion, minced
1  soy sauce
6 cup oil (for frying)
2 cup soup stock
2 teaspoon dried pickled cabbage
2 teaspoon sesame oil
10  carrot balls
10  turnip balls

      ----SEASONINGS----
5  ginger slice
2 teaspoon salt
1  peppercorns
1 teaspoon sugar colour
1 teaspoon pepper, ground
1/2 tablespoon wine
1 tablespoon soy sauce

Scrape hair off the pork foot. rinse. Chop into sections. Remove
bones. Cook in boiling water briefly. Add some soy sauce to the pork
foot. Heat oil for frying. Fry the pork foot till golden brown.
Remove and drain. Save some oil in the wok. Add seasonings. Stir
quickly. Add stock and pork foot. Simmer over a low flame for 1 hour.
Remove. Steam for 10 minutes. Save the juice oozing out from the pork
foot. Put the pork foot, upside down, on the plate. Stir-fry the
dried pickled cabbage with sesame oil. Add the juice above,
cornstarch paste, and spring onion. Mix well. Pour it over the pork
foot. Fry the carrot and turnip balls for 3 minutes. Garnish the dish
with them and add some spinach. Serve.

Note: Sugar colour is made by frying granulated sugar and rock sugar
with oil over a very small flame. It looks like soy sauce and helps
deepen the colour of the dish.

Scholars.

bell peppers and cut into 1-inch squares; cut remaining green onions
into 1-inch lengths. Place a wok over high heat; when wok is hot, add
2 tbs. of the oil. When oil is hot, add bell peppers and stir fry for
1 1/2 minutes, adding a few drops of water if wok appears dry.
Sprinkle with salt and stir once, then remove peppers from wok. Add
remaining 1 tbs. oil to wok. When oil begins to heat, add garlic and
minced ginger and stir once; then add pork and stir-fry for 1 minute.
Add bean sauce mixture and toss until pork is coated with sauce.
Return bell peppers to wok along with onion. Stir-fry for 30 seconds
to heat through. EAT-L Gary Watson

Venison Sauces

meats, sauces, ethnic

1/4 pound sugar
1/2 pint champagne vinegar
1  sweet sauce:
6 ounce white or red currant jelly
6 ounce white or red wine

Sharp Sauce:

Sharp Sauce:--A quarter-pound of the best loaf-sugar, or white
candy-sugar, dissolved in a half-pint of Champagne vinegar, and
carefully skimmed.

Sweet Sauce:--Melt some white or red currant jelly with a glass of
white or red wine, whichever suits best in color; or serve jelly
unmelted in a small sweetmeat-glass.  This sauce answers well for
hare, fawn, or kid, and for roast mutton to many tastes.

Gravy for Venison:--Make a pint of gravy of trimmings of venison or
shanks of mutton thus:  broil the meat on a quick fire till it is
browned, then stew it slowly. Skim, strain, and serve the gravy it
yields, adding salt and a teaspoonful of walnut pickle.

Vietnamese Pork Burgers

pork, vietnamese

1 pound lean ground pork
3  garlic cloves, chopped
2  green onions, chopped
2 teaspoon soy sauce
2 teaspoon peanut or other mild vegetable oil
1 pinch sugar
1  few drops Tabasco sauce, or pinch c; ayenne pepper
1  hoisin sauce
1 large whole lettuce leaves
1/2 cup or so roasted peanuts, coarsely gro; und
1  handful cilantro, coarsely chopped

This is typical of what is becoming known here as East/West cuisine,
the flavors and ingredients of Asia presented in a Western form. All
these are from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 7/15/92.
Each bite of these burgers packs a zesty wallop of flavor and
texture. Good accompaniments are bland steamed rice or French bread,
each of which balances these assertive flavors.

Mix meat with garlic, onions, soy sauce, peanut oil, sugar and
Tabasco or cayenne.  Form into patties and grill until cooked
through. Serve each grilled patty spread with hoisin sauce, wrapped
in a leaf of lettuce, sprinkled with peanuts and cilantro.

Makes 4 servings.

NOTE: In the body of the accompanying article, the author suggests
using pita bread lightly spread with hoisin and putting the patties
into it along with some of the cabbage salad. That's probably the way
I'd go.

Welsh Rarebit With Ham & Watercress

ham, cheese

      ----RAREBIT (SAUCE----
2  eggs, at room temperature
6 ounce bottled beer or ale
3/4 pound Cheddar cheese, coarse shred
1 1/2 tablespoon butter or margarine
3/4 teaspoon dry mustard
3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/8 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
      ----BASE----
2 slice homebaked bread, toasted
4 slice black forest ham
      ----VEGETABLE FILLING----
1 1/2 cup watercress, fresh
1/4 cup green pepper, julienne
      ----GARNISH----
1  tomato slices, thin

1. Beat eggs until well blended. 2. Stir remaining sauce ingredients,
together with the eggs, in a double-boiler. The type of beer used is a
personal preference. A variety beer such as an imported German,
British, etc beer is recommended so as to make the recipe less
ordinary. A Pilsener or Lager may add more foam to the mixture and
make the rarebit lighter in texture. 3. Bring a double-boiler to the
boil then reduce heat to medium to heat mixture. Leave mixture
uncovered and stir mixture thoroughly about once every minute. 4.
When the desired consistency is achieved, Beat mixture with rotary
beater or electric mixer until very smooth. Leave in double-boiler to
maintain temperature. 5. Toast bread slices. Home-made bread, sliced
slightly thicker than commercial bread, is preferrable. Variety
home-made breads would vary texture and flavour. 6. Drape 1 to 2
slices of Black Forest Ham (or alternative delicatessen meat slices)
over toasted bread. Place on dinner plate and set in warming oven
approx 10 min. prior to serving. 7. Steam watercress with julienne
green peppers until heated through. These vegetables should be as
close to uncooked as possible, although heated. Microwave may be
utilized (approx 2 min at high). Wild watercress would enhance
flavour. 8. Mound a portion of watercress and green pepper in the
middle of the ham slices on the serving plates. Ladle a generous
amount of the rarebit over the vegetables, ham and toast - allowing
it to flow to cover the plate bottom. Accent plate by dropping thinly
sliced uncooked tomato on the top of each mound.

Wok-Fried Sweet & Sour Pork

pork

1  egg yolk
2 teaspoon water
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 pound pork -- 1 cubes
2 cup peanut oil
1  garlic clove -- minced
2  green peppers
1 cup pineapple chunks in juice
3 cup glutinous rice

~-- Sauce: --- 3/4 cup water 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon soy
sauce 1      tablespoon    catsup 4 tablespoons sugar 4 tablespoons
wine vinegar 1
dash          hot pepper sauce

SAUCE: Blend the water and cornstarch until smooth. Stir in the
catsup, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar and, if desired, a few drops of hot
pepper seasoning. Set aside.

PORK: Beat egg yolk with the water. Blend in 1 tablespoon flour and 1
tablespoon cornstarch until smooth. Add the cubed pork and mix to coat
well. Drain off the excess mixture from the pork cubes. Place the wok
over heat and add oil to 1-1/2 inch depth. Heat to 340 degrees. Use a
thermometer if you can; it is more reliable than a wok with a
temperature gauge. Add the drained meat and cook until golden brown,
about 10-13 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep meat warm.
Pour off all the oil and wipe wok with a paper towel. Return 2
tablespoons of the oil to wok. Place over medium-high heat. When oil
is hot, add the garlic and green peppers. Stir-fry for about 2
minutes, or until garlic is light brown. Add the pineapple, the sauce
you prepared ahead of time and the pork. Stir this mixture until it
boils and thickens (about 1-1/2 minutes). Serve over steamy hot rice.

in the center of each round; top with 1 portion of aspic. Bring up
the sides of each round and twist up in a decorative pattern, making
sure to seal the top. If holes appear, patch them at once!

Put each dumpling on a square of waxed paper or a piece of bok choy
leaf and steam, preferably in a bamboo steamer, for 8 min. Serve hot.

Note on aspic:

If you don't have any on hand, use about 1 1/2 c of homemade chicken
broth (or good-quality canned low-salt broth): boil 1 c of broth,
uncovered, for about 2 min (reducing it quite a bit) while dissolving
1 envelope gelatin in the other 1/2 c. Mix together and stir over low
heat until all gelatin is dissolved. Chill. This will make a hard
aspic, enough for 3 recipes of this dim sum.
