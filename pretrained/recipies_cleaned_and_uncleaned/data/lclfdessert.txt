Baklava (Low Fat Low Cal Version)

low cal, deserts, ethnic

1/2 lb shelled pistachio nuts, ground
3 tablespoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tablespoon rose water
1/2 lb filo dough
1/2 cup low-calorie margarine, melted
1 rose water syrup
1 whole cloves,optional

This rich-tasting baklava contains half the amount of sugar and a
fraction of the fat you would normally use, thanks to reduced fats,
sugar, and nuts. The results will fool anyone. 1. Combine pistacho
nuts, sugar, cinnamon and rose water in small bowl. Using half of
filo sheets (cover remaining with plastic wrap to prevent from drying
out), place 3 sheets in bottom of lightly greased 13x9" baking sheet.
Brush with some of margarine. Sprinkle evenly with nut mixture. Place
remaining sheets over nut filling, brushing after every third sheet
and top sheet. 2. Cut baklava at 1-1/2" intervals diagonally to form
pattern of about 35 diamond shapes. Bake at 400'F. 25 minutes or
until golden. Place on wire rack to cool. Drizzle Rose Water Syrup
evenly over top and allow to soak several hours. Stud each
diamond-shape with whole clove.

BANANA/PINEAPPLE TROPICAL SORBET

deserts, low fat, bananas

1  pineapple
2 chopped bananas
3 tablespoon sugar
1 cup plain nonfat yogurt
1 tablespoon honey

Because this sorbet is frozen in the pineapple shell, you must cut
out the flesh according to the following special method. First, slice
off the top, just at the point where the edges begin to straighten.
Now stand the pineapple up on its bottom end. Insert a long,
thin-bladed knife into the exposed flesh, next to the pineapple's
outer skin. Push the knife in tin the entire length of the pineapple,
stopping just above the bottom - CAREFUL - you don't want to
penetrate through the bottom. Cut in a circle around the edge just
inside the skin. You've now created a long cylinder of pineapple
flesh that's connected to the shell only at the bottom.

To separate the bottom of this fruit cylinder, insert the knife into
the side of the pineapple, about 1 inch from the bottom. Without
enlarging the hole that is the knife's entry point into the fruit,
fan the blade back and forth, cutting through the inside fruit
cylinder in a large "V". Repeat this procedure on the opposite side.
Now the long, central p pineapple cylinder is free.

Invert the pineapple over a bowl to catch the juice. Plunge a fork
into the pineapple cylinder's top end and, with firm determination,
pull it out into the bowl. Remove the tough central core of the fruit
by cutting the cylinder into quarters and then trimming off the
center strip of eac each piece. Remove any "eyes".

Roughly chop the remaining pineapple flesh and put it into the bowl
with the reserved juice. The rest is easier!!

Puree pineapple flesh and juice with bananas in food processor,
gradually adding the sugar, yogurt and honey. Transfer to ice cream
maker and process according to directions. Scoop sorbet into hollowed
out pineapple shell, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least
an hour.

To serve: Remove from freezer just before serving. Slice the
pineapple from top to bottom into 6 wedges.

Of course, one needn't go to all that trouble...but it's a lovely way
to present the sorbet. If you don't want to do it, then skip all the
hard part, and just chop up the pineapple flesh and go from there and
serve directly out of the ice cream maker!! :)

This will also get posted in the low fat topic, as it only has 1 gm

Bananas & Pancakes

cakes, deserts, low fat, bananas

1 large or 1-2 small bananas per
1  person
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoon calvados, grand marnier or
1  cointreau
5 fl oz oz orange juice
2 tablespoon molasses sugar
1  egg
4 oz flour
10 fl oz oz lager beer

Make pancakes with lager, flour and egg, and cook in the normal way
(I used a cooking spray to grease a non-stick frying pan). Fold each
pancake in half, and then in half again, so it forms a quarter-circle
(if you're as bad at cooking pancakes as I am, they'll come out in
bits anyway - if so, pretend it didn't happen!), and place them in a
large flan dish.

Peel bananas, cut in half long-ways and in half again cross-ways, and
place face-down on top of the pancakes. Put the remaining ingredients
into a frying pan or small saucepan, and boil for 3-4 minutes, until
just beginning to be syrupy.  Pour over bananas and pancakes, and
bake in a moderate oven (Mark 4 - 350 F) for 20-30 minutes.

I served this with fromage frais (cream substitute) and a chocolate
sauce, for which the recipe follows:

Best Ever Sponge

cakes, deserts, low fat

      ----2 EGG SPONGE----
2  eggs
1/3 cup caster sugar
2 tablespoon cornflour
2 tablespoon plain flour
2 tablespoon self-raising flour
      ----3 EGG SPONGE----
3  eggs
1/2 cup caster sugar
1/4 cup cornflour
1/4 cup plain flour
1/4 cup self-raising flour
      ----4 EGG SPONGE----
4  eggs
2/3 cup caster sugar
1/3 cup cornflour
1/3 cup plain flour
1/3 cup self-raising flour

This is a favorite never-fail sponge recipe: it does not contain
liquid or butter, which makes it ideal for Swiss rolls. It is simple
to adapt to many flavors and will work as a cake or a roll. Have eggs
at room temperature. Beat whole eggs in small bowl with electric
mixer until thick and creamy (the small bowl is necessary to give
maximum volume to eggs); beating time on a moderately high speed
should be about 7 mins. Add sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time,
beating after each addition until sugar is dissolved.

While eggs and sugar are beating, prepare pans by greasing evenly
(see lift of pan sizes below); and sift dry ingredients together 3
times, to aerate and mix the flours.

When sugar is dissolved, transfer mixture to larger basin; this makes
it easier to fold the ingredients through the egg mixture *it is not
necessary to transfer the 2 egg mixture to a larger basin). Sift the
flours over the egg mixture, use a spatula to lightly fold the flours
through; heavy handling at this stage will give a flat, tough sponge.
Spread mixture evenly into pan, bake in moderate oven for cooking
time specified below. When cooked, sponge will have shrunk very
slightly from side of pan and top of sponge will feel springy when
touched gently with fingertips. Turn sponge immediately onto wire
rack to cool, then reverse sponge so that wire rack does not mark the
top.

Cake Pans and Cooking Times:

2 egg: Deep 20cm round cake pan or recess pan about 20 mins. A deep
pan is preferable rather than a sandwich pan as the sponge will be
less crusty on top because the high sides protect the top during
cooking.

3 egg: 2 deep 17cm cake or sandwich pans about 15 mins, or 25cm x 30cm
Swiss roll pan about 12 mins.

4 egg: 2 deep 20cm round cake pans about 20 mins, or deep 23cm round
cake pan about 40 mins.

Variations:

Citrus:  Beat in 2 teaspoons of your favorite grated citrus rind with
the sugar.  Try lemon, mandarin, lime, orange or grapefruit.

Nut:  Fold in 1/4 cup of any type of ground nuts with the flours.

Chocolate:  Fold in 60g grated dark chocolate with the flours.

Fill and ice sponges as desired.

Keeping time: 2 days.

1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cup flour
1 cup applesauce
1 cup egg whites
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 tablespoon lemon extract
1 orange liqueur

Cut pineapple, apricots, and peaches into 1/2" dice and combine in
large bowl.  Add flour, tossing to coat fruit. In separate bowl, sift
tgether sugar, baking powder, and flour.

Preheat oven to 250.

In small bowl combine applesauce, egg whites, vanilla, and lemon
extract. Stir into dried fruit mixture.  Add flour mixture, stirring
until blended. Spoon batter into 9" tube pan, lighly sprayed with
non-stick cooking spray.

Bake 3 hours.  Let cake cool in pan on rack.

Remove from pan.  Soak clean cheesecloth in orange liqueur. Wrap cake.
Store in covered container in refrigerator one month or longer before
serving, occasionally adding more liqueur to cake.

At LAST! I've got the fat free fruitcake recipe. This is SO good. You
won't believe your taste buds.

Now, my grandmother brought me a regular loaf-shaped loaf - meatloaf
sized. She said it made several that size. I'll have to ask her if

2 can cake flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2  unsalted butter; softened
1 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup light brown sugar; packed
2 large eggs; room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cup strongly brewed coffee; room
      ----CARAMELIZED HAZELNUTS & PRAL---
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup water
12  hazelnuts <see note below> -
3/4 cup hazelnuts; toasted

Recipe by: <lhroberts@aol.com> NOTE: Position a rack in the center of
the oven and preheat to 350F. Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet
and toast for 12-15 minutes, or until golden beneath the skins. Wrap
the nuts in a clean towel and cool completely. Transfer the cooled
hazelnuts to a large sieve and rub them back and forth to remove the
loose skins.

Make the chocolate butter cake: Position a rack in the center of the
oven and preheat to 375F. Line the bottom of a 17 1/2x11 1/2 jelly
roll pan with parchment or wax paper. Lightly spray the bottom and
sides of the pan with nonstick cooking spray. In a medium bowl, whisk
together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Sift the
flour mixture onto a piece of wax paper and set aside. In a 4 1/2 qt.
bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using a paddle attachment, beat
the butter at medium-high speed for 1 minute, until creamy. While
continuing to beat the butter, gradually add the granulated and brown
sugars, stopping the machine and scraping down the side of the bowl
as necessary. Beat the butter/sugar mixture at medium-high speed for
2 minutes, until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and the
vanilla. Reduce the speed to low, and alternately add 1/3 of the
reserved dry ingred. and 1/3 of the coffee. In 2 more batches,
alternately add the remaining dry ingred. and coffee, scraping down
the bowl as necessary. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and,
using a metal cake spatula, smooth the batter evenly into the pan.
Bake the cake for 25-28 min., until the sides just begin to pull away
from the pan and the surface springs back when lightly touched. Cool
the cake in the pan set on a wire rack for 10 min. Invert the cake
onto a wire rack; carefully peel off the parchment paper and allow
the cake to cool completely.

Make the caramelized hazelnuts and praline: Lightly spray a baking
sheet with nonstick cooking spray. In a small saucepan, combine the
sugar and water. Cook over med. heat, stirring constantly, until the
sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue to
cook without stirring for 4-6 min., until the syrup caramelizes.
Immediately remove the pan from the heat. Add the 12 perfect
hazelnuts to the caramel and toss to coat. With an oiled fork, remove
each hazelnut, letting the excess caramel drip back into the pan, and
place them at one end of the prepared baking sheet. Quickly stir the
3/4 c. of hazelnuts into the remaining hot caramel. Pour the hazelnut
praline onto the other end of the baking sheet. Cool the praline for
30 min. until hard. Reserve the individual caramelized hazelnuts for
decorating the cake. Coarsely chop the praline. In a food processor
fitted with the metal chopping blade, process the praline for 35-45
seconds until finely ground. Transfer the praline to a bowl and set
aside.

Chocolate Bread Pudding  Lowfat

chocolate, low fat, puddings

12 slice french bread slice --
1  good-quality, day-
1  old, or italian
1  baguette, about 1
1  thick (3-4 oz total
1  wt)  (1)
1 1/2  egg beaters® 99% egg
1  substitute -- equiv to 3
1  eggs (2)
2 1/2 cup milk, 1% lowfat -- (2.  5)
1/4 cup honey -- (3)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon brandy -- or kahlua
1/3 cup cocoa powder --
1  dutch-process (4)
2 teaspoon cornstarch
1 pinch salt

Last night I finally tried the chocolate bread recipe in "Sweet
Nothings" and it was GREAT! The only fat comes from that which is in
1/3 C. of cocoa powder and the bread. It's supposed to have 3 eggs,
but I didn't have any eggs so I used substitute instead and it was
fine.

Even though I was out of a lot of the ingredients, I managed to
make-do with what I had on hand. Perhaps it would've been tastier if
made exactly according to recipe, but as it stands it's pretty damn
tasty!

Here's the original unaltered recipe (my alterations are below):

Arrange bread slices, staggering them, in a 12 - 14" long oval gratin
dish or a 4 C souffle dish.

In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, honey, sugar, vanilla
and brandy or Kahlua. Sift the cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt
together onto the egg mixture, then whisk until thoroughly combined
(and your arm will probably want to fall off at this point).

Pour the cocoa-egg mixture evenly over the bread slices and let stand
until all the bread is thoroughly saturated with the custard.
Depending upon the freshness of the bread (5) and the dish you
choose, this could take 1 - 2 hrs. Bake the pudding in a 325 deg F
oven for 40 - 60 min, until it is barely firm to the touch but not
dry and pulling away from the sides of the dish. Serve warm or,
alternatively, cover and chill thoroughly before serving. 170
calories, 2.
7 g  fat (6)

1) I didn't have the right bread but I did have some Squaw bread in
the freezer so I dried it out in the over at a low temperature for
about 1/2 an hour.

2) I didn't have eggs so I used egg sub.

2.  5) Forgot this one. I didn't have any skim milk on hand so I used
a can of nonfat evaporated milk and added water to make 2. 5 C.

3) I didn't have any honey so I used corn syrup (a little extra
because honey is so sweet).

4) You can use unsweetend Herschey's cocoa for it if you don't want
to try to locate dutch-process. Actually, dutch-processing just
leaves more of the fat in the cocoa.

5) I broke the bread up into pieces rather than leaving it in slices.
I figured that would help along the soaking process. I let it soak
for 10-15 min.

6) Probably lots less fat without using real eggs. I estimate 3g from
the cocoa. At most only 1g or so per serving. -- npm@netcom. com

Chocolate Triple Layer Cake With Fluffy Choco

cakes, chocolate, low fat

1 oz unsweetened chocolate
2 cup cake flour
6 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, slightly softened
1 1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
4  egg whites
1/4 cup room-temperature coffee
2 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup plain nonfat yogurt
2 tablespoon plain nonfat yogurt
      ----FLUFFY CHOCOLATE FROSTING----
3 large egg whites
1/2 oz unsweetened chocolate
2 1/2 tablespoon light corn syrup
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 pinch salt
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon instant coffee powder
1 teaspoon hot water
1/4 cup powdered sugar
3 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder

Preheat oven to 350'F. Grease (or spray with non-stick cooking spray)
three 8" or 8 1/2" round cake pans.

In a small, heavy saucepan over lowest heat, melt chocolate, stirring
constantly until smooth; be careful not to scorch. Set aside. Sift
together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt
onto a sheet of wax paper. In a large mixer bowl, with mixer set on
medium speed, beat oil, butter and sugar until very well blended and
fluffy. Beat in chocolate. One at a time, beat in egg, then whites,
coffee and vanilla until smoothly incorporated. Gently stir half of
the dry ingredients, then yogurt into the mixture just until mixed.
Stir in remaining dry ingredients just until well blended and smooth.
Divide batter among pans, spreading in edges.

Bake in the middle of the oven for 23-28 minutes, or until tops are
almost firm when tapped and a toothpick inserted in the center comes
out moist but clean. Transfer pans to racks and let stand until
completely cooled. Layers may be wrapped airtight and frozen for
later use. Let return to room temperature before using. Or frost cake
and serve immediately, if desired. Makes 10-12 servings.

Nutritional information (with fluffy chocolate frosting): Each serving
contains 342 calories, 10 grams of fat, 2 grams of saturated fat, 25
milligrams of cholesterol, 202 milligrams of sodium. Percentage of
calories from fat: 26.

FLUFFY CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Place egg whites in a large mixer bowl.
Set the bowl in a large bowl of very hot tap water and let stand for
10 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a small heavy saucepan set over
low heat, melt chocolate, stirring constantly, until smooth; be very
careful not to scorch. Set aside to cool slightly.

Combine the corn syrup, 1/4 cup water and the sugar in a 2-quarter
saucepan, stirring until well blended. Bring to a simmer over
medium-heat heat. Cover and boil for 2 minutes to allow steam to wash
any sugar from pan sides. Uncover and continue simmering, without
stirring, until mixture bubbles loudly and reaches 244-245'F on a
candy thermometer (about 1 1/2 minutes). (To test without a candy
thermometer, drop a teaspoon of syrup into ice water; when cooked to
the proper temperature the syrup will form a firm ball that holds its
shape when squeezed.) Immedately remove pan from heat and set aside.

With mixer set on medium speed, beat egg whites until very frothy and
opaque. Raise speed to high and beat until whites just begin to stand
in soft peaks; be careful not to overbeat. Meanwhile, return syrup to
burner and reheat just to boiling. Beating whites on high speed,
immediately begin pouring boiling syrup in a stream down the side of
the bowl (avoid beaters or syrup will stick to them or be thrown onto
bowl side), pouring rapidly enough that all the syrup is incorporated
in about 15 seconds. Add salt and continue beating on high speed
until the mixture is stiffened, glossy and cooled to barely warm.
Beat in vanilla and coffee mixture until evenly incorporated. Sift
powdered sugar and cocoa onto a sheet of wax paper. A bit at a time,
whisk into egg-white mixture. Whisk in melted chocolate just until
smoothly incorporated.

Frost cake immediately, or store frosting airtight for up to 48 hours.
Frosting may soften and gradually deflate upon longer standing.

Double Cappuccino Heaven

low cal, deserts

1 1/2 cup superfine sugar
3/4 cup cake flour
1/3 cup cocoa  preferably dutch process
2 tablespoon instant espresso powder
2 cup egg whites (1 c equals about 8 larg; e)
1 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
      ----CAPPUCCINO FLUFF FROSTING----
2 large egg whites
1/2 tablespoon superfine sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
12  marshmallows  each cut into 8 piece; s  (use scissors)
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon cocoa  preferably dutch process
2 teaspoon instant espresso powder
1 pinch salt

Angel cake is not only no-cholesterol and no-fat but absolutely
delicious with a light, puffy texture. Here, the cappuccino flavor is
so deep that it's hard to believe that it lacks any fat at all.
PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F with rack in center of oven. Have an ungreased
10-inch tube pan ready. Divide sugar in half. Sift 1/2 3 times. Set
aside. Sift other half with flour, cocoa and espresso powder 3 times.
Set aside. Put egg whites in 4-quart grease-free bowl. Beat on low
speed with mixer until frothy. Add cream of tartar and salt. Increase
speed to medium. Beat until whites are whipped and hold their shape
but are still soft and moist. Add 3/4 cup sifted sugar, 1 tablespoon
at a time, beating well after each addition, until all sugar is
added. Add vanilla. Stop beating when whites have increased in volume
about fivefold, hold their shape and are shiny and smooth. Gently but
thoroughly fold in flour mixture, by thirds. Transfer to baking pan.
Smooth surface with spatula. Cut through batter in 6 places to break
any large air pockets. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes
out clean, about 35-to-40 minutes, laying piece of foil lightly over
top if it gets too brown. Invert and rest tube on inverted custard
cup. Prop pan extensions with crumpled foil to secure pan. Cool
completely. When cake is completely cool, use flexible knife to
loosen it from sides of pan. Invert onto rack. Keep cake at room
temperature 2 days, well covered, or frozen (airtight) as long as 3
months. Be sure to thaw at room temperature in wrapping. Frost.
CAPPUCCINO FLUFF FROSTING: Put egg whites, sugar and corn syrup in
top of double boiler. Place over simmering water. Immediately use
mixer at medium speed to beat ingredients until fluffy, white and
warmed through, about 5 minutes. Stir in marshmallows. Once combined,
beat at lowest speed until marshmallows are melted and mixture is
smooth. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla, cocoa, espresso and salt.
Spread on top and sides of cake. Yield: frosting for 1 10-inch tube
cake.

Entenmann's Fat-Free Oatmeal Raisin Coookies

cookies, deserts, low fat

1  waldine van geffen
      VGHC42A-----
1 tablespoon molasses
3  raw egg whites
1 cup dark raisins
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup light brown sugar -- packed
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup non-fat dry milk powder
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 1/2 cup quaker brand quick-cooking
1  rolled oats
1 cup all-purpose flour

Put molasses, egg whites and raisins into blender and blend on high
speed just to mince but not to puree (about 5-10 seconds). Empty
mixture into medium mixing bowl. With mixer beat in on medium speed
each of the remaining ingredients, beating well after each addition,
adding both the oats and flour in small portions. Switch to mixing
spoon if dough becomes too stiff for mixer. Lightly spray cookie
sheet with Pam and wipe off excess lightly with paper towel; any
excess of the cookie sheet may burn while cookies are baking. You
need only a very light film of the Pam just to keep cookies from
sticking. Use 1 measuring teaspoonful of dough for each cookie and
place 2" apart on prepared cookie sheet. Bake in preheated 350~ oven
6-8 minutes. Do not overbake. Cool on paper towels, removing from
cookie sheets carefully. Source: Gloria Pitzer

High-Summer Pudding

low cal, deserts

1/4 cup cranberry or cran-raspberry juice c; ocktail
2 1/2 tablespoon blackberry brandy or kirsch (cherry; brandy)
1  or orange juice
1  envelope plus 1 1/2 tsp unflavored; gelatin
1 lb red or black plums, pitted and chop; ped (5-6 medium)
1 cup sugar
1 1/4 lb fresh peaches, peeled, pitted and c; hopped (4-5 medium)
2 1/2 cup fresh blackberries or black or red; raspberries
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
15 slice thin-sliced homemade-style white br; ead (such as

Pepperidge Farm), crusts removed

Line a 2-quart bowl or mold with plastic wrap, carefully smoothing
the wrap onto the bottom and sides so that the plastic hangs 1 inch
over sides. In a small bowl, mix cranberry juice and brandy, kirsch
or orange juice and sprinkle gelatin over the surface; let stand 5
minutes until softened.

Combine plums, sugar and gelatin mixture in a medium-sized saucepan.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring for 3-4 minutes until
the gelatin dissolves.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 7 minutes.
Add peaches and simmer for about 5 minutes longer, until the peaches
are almost tender. Stir in blackberries, lemon zest and cinnamon and
simmer 3-4 minutes longer, until the berries begin to release their
juice. Refrigerate.

Arrange bread slices in the bottom of the bowl or mold, cutting as
needed and fitting them tightly together. Arrange more slices all
around the sides of the dish, fitting them together tightly and
smoothly. Taking care not to dislodge the bread, spoon the fruit
mixture into the center of the dish, tilting the dish to distribute
the fruit evenly. If the bread extends more than 1/4 inch above the
layer of fruit, trim it with a knife. Cover the fruit with another
layer of bread, patting it down firmly. Stack several saucers or
small plates on the bread to weight down the pudding. Refrigerate for
at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.

To serve:  Invert the bowl over a serving plate, tugging the
overhanging plastic wrap to loosen the pudding from the dish. Center
the pudding on the serving plate and peel off the plastic wrap.
Serve immediately, cut into wedges.  Serves 6.

1/4 teaspoon salt

For Fruit Topping:

1 (10 ounce) box sweetened frozen raspberries, thawed
2    Tablespoons cornstarch

In a food processor or blender, grind the plain chocolate wafers into
fine crumbs. Generously coat a 8.1/2 inch or 9 inch springform pan
with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the crumbs into the pan and tilt to
coat the bottom and the sides evenly. Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350^F. With an electric mixer, beat the fat-free cream
cheese until soft. Add the sugar, cocoa, vanilla extract and raspberry
preserves and continue beating until the ingredients are
incorporated. Add the egg substitutes, fat free sour cream and salt
and continue beating until no lumps remain and mixture is smooth and
liquid. You may have to beat the mixture for several minutes to reach
this consistency.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Place in oven and immediately
reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Bake for one hour, or until
center is set and firm to the touch. Turn off oven and allow
cheesecake to stay in cooling oven for one hour longer. Remove and
cool completely. Refrigerate overnight before serving.

To make the raspberry sauce, puree the raspberries in a food
processor or blender. Strain the pulp through a tea strainer,
pressing to remove all the seeds. Discard seeds. Place the cornstarch
in a saucepan and stir in the raspberry juice. Bring to a boil,
stirring constantly until thickened. Remove from heat immediately to
prevent lumps from forming. Cool and chill. Serve one tablespoon of
sauce on top of each slice of cheesecake.

Cake can also be frozen for two to three weeks before serving. To
serve, thaw for 2 days in the refrigerator, then allow to come to
room temperature before slicing.

No-Bake Pineapple Cheesecake

cakes, deserts, cheese cake, low fat

      ----FOR CRUST----
12  graham cracker squares (2 1/2; 16 for 10 plate)
1/3 cup grape nuts cereal (1/2 cup for 10 p; late)
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon hazelnut, walnut or canola oil
1 teaspoon unsalted butter, melted
1  (2 t for 10 place)
1/2 large egg white (1 tb for 10 plate)
2 tablespoon fruit juice or water, or as needed; (1 tb for 10 plate)
      ----FOR FILLING----
1 1/4 cup non-fat vanilla yogurt
1 can crushed pineapple, unsweetened or i; n light syrup (20 oz)
3/4 cup non-fat cottage cheese
3/4 cup low-fat cream cheese, at room tempe; rature
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoon pineapple extract
3 tablespoon lemon juice
3 1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin

To make crust: Position rack in center of oven, and preheat oven to
350'F. Crumble the graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor
and process until crumbs form. Add the cereal, sugar, oil, butter,
egg white and 1 teaspoon juice or water. Pulse until the crumbs are
evenly moistened. Pinch a spoonful of crumbs together, and test
whether they are moist enough to hold the print of your finger. If
necessary, add a few more drops of juice or water and pulse once or
twice. Turn the crumbs into an 8" springform pan or a 10" pie plate
and use your hand or the back of a metal spoon to press an even layer
around the sides of the pan. Spread the remaining crumbs evenly over
the pan bottom. Top with a piece of wax paper, and press to form an
even layer, taking care not to build up the crumbs in the corner.
Bake the shell for 7 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before
filling. The crust firms and crisps as it cools. To make filling:
Place the yogurt in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl and set
aside to drain for at least 20 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl, and
discard the whey. Drain the crushed pineapple in a strainer set over
a bowl. Press the fruit lightly with the back of a large spoon to
release all the juice. Transfer the pineapple to a small bowl, and
reserve 1/2 cup of the juice. Place the cottage cheese in a strainer
set over a bowl. cover it with a piece of plastic wrap, and press
down firmly on the cheese to force excess liquid from the curds.
Place the cottage cheese and cream cheese in a blender or a food
processor. Process for at least 3 minutes, or until absolutely
smooth, with no trace of graininess, stopping once to scrape down the
sides with a rubber spatula. Add the sugar, vanilla, pineapple
extract and drained yogurt. Pulse until well blended. Scrape down the
sides with a rubber spatula, and pulse several times. Add 1 1/2 cups
of the drained crushed pineapple and pulse just to blend. In a small
saucepan, combine the reserved 1/2 cup pineapple juice and the lemon
juice. Sprinkle on the gelatin and allow to sit about 3 minutes to
soften. Then stir the mixture over low heat just until the gelatin is
dissolved; do not boil. With the blender or food processor running,
add the gelatin mixture and pulse to blend. Pour the filling into the
crust and refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight before serving.
Once the top is firm, cover it with plastic wrap.

Panettone

cakes, low cal, holiday, ethnic

1 cup candied cherries
1/4 cup marsala
3 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 teaspoon quick-rising dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
2/3 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon vanilla
2  eggs
2  egg yolks
1  zest of half an orange
1/2 cup nuts (pine nuts, walnuts, or hazeln; uts)
1/2 cup green candied pineapple edges
1  powdered sugar for dusting on the t; op

An Italian Christmas is not complete without this high-domed cylinder
of fruit-studded sweet bread. This recipe has an option of using the
microwave to make the bread rise. Soak the cherries in the wine. In
the processor bowl fitted with steel blade, combine flour, sugar,
salt, yeast and nutmeg. Pulse to mix. Cut butter into pieces and
arrange on the top. Pulse to blend so that it almost disappears. In a
glass measure, combine the milk and water. Microwave on high about 40
seconds (see power levels), then with a fork, whisk in the vanilla,
eggs, and egg yolks. With the processor motor running, drizzle the
liquids very slowly into the flour mixture processor. Process 60
seconds. Add orange zest and pulse to mix. Transfer to large glass
mixing bowl and cover loosely with plastic wrap. To use the microwave
for bread rising, place the bowl in the microwave. Place an 8-ounce
glass of water in the back of the microwave. Lower the microwave to
low (see power levels). Place the dough in the microwave. Heat on low
for 3 minutes. Rest for 3 minutes. Heat on low for 3 minutes longer.
Rest for 6 minutes, or until the batter has risen to double in bulk
and is bubbly and light. Or let the dough rise in a warm draft-free
place about 45 to 60 min. When dough has doubled in bulk, stir the
batter down, then stir in the cherry mixture, nuts and candied
pineapple until well distributed. Grease generously and lightly flour
two, 1-pound coffee cans. Cut a parchment or wax paper circle to fit
the bottom of each can and add it, dusting and flouring it as well.
Spoon the batter into the cans, filling about halfway. Press down
slightly. Let rise in a warm, draft free place until nearly doubled
in bulk, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Just before popping it in the oven, cut an X in the tops of the
loaves with a razor. Italian bakers put a blob of butter into the
cut. Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour, or until evenly browned and a
skewer stuck in the center comes out clean. Remove immediately to a
rack to cool, then 15 minutes later, slide the cakes out of the pans
and lay them on their sides to continue cooling. Dust with powdered
sugar while warm. When cooled, wrap in plastic to store.

chocolate mixture, then fold in flour, just until incorporated. Pour

Poor Man's Cake

cakes, deserts, low fat

1 1/4 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable shortening *
1 teaspoon salt
2 cup flour
2/3 cup raisins
1/2 teaspoon nutmaeg
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cloves
1 teaspoon soda
2 teaspoon water
1 teaspoon baking powder

(the name comes from the fact that the cake calls for no eggs, no
milk, and no butter)

*NOTE:  (Since the shortening is melted, I substituted Canola oil,
thus, I think, saving a LOT of cholestrol and saturated fats!)

Boil brown sugar, 1 1/4 C water, oil or shortneing, raisins and spices
together for three minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.

Add salt and baking soda, dissolved in 2 tsp water. Sift together
flour and baking powder, add gradually, beating after each addition.

Grease and flour 8" square pan.  (I used nonfat spray instead).

Bake at 325 for approximately 50 minutes, until it tests done.

Needs no frosting.

(would be HEAVENLY with a big blob of whipped cream...but it's really
unnecessary.  this sucker is GOOD!)

Rhubarb Fool

deserts, low fat

1 lb fresh rhubarb
1  juice and rind of one
1  orange
1  sugar to taste
1  sachet gelatine
1  cream substitute of some
1  sort: yogurt, fromage frais,
1  evaporated milk,
1  whatever

Stew the rhubarb with the orange rind/juice, sugar, and as little
water as you can get away with.  Melt in the gelatine (if you are
vegetarian or vegan, use another gelling agent), and then put through
food processor to make puree.  Add the cream substitute - I would use
fromage frais, but yogurt is fine, or you might like whisked
evaporated milk, if you like the taste.  Then refrigerate until set.

If, like me, the mere thought of rhubarb sets your teeth on edge
(it's one of the very few things I really can't eat!), then use a
different fruit - gooseberries, perhaps, or dried apricots.
Gooseberries are nicest if stewed with elderflowers, if you can get
them, and dried apricots don't need any help. I've not quoted
quantities for the sugar, because it depends on your taste.

Spiced Apple Pudding

low cal, deserts, ice cream

2 cup unsweetened apple juice
1/3 cup cornstarch
1  egg (or 2 yolks)
1/3 cup granulated sugar substitute
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

MY NOTE:  This recipe is marked in the allergy category only because
it is a pudding without milk, also low in protein. It is one of my
favorite ways to use up egg yolks or prepare a dessert when I've run
out of milk. Probably does not require as much sweetening as stated
in the recipe - start with 2 Tbsp. sweetener and add more if
necessary. Cost to make the whole recipe is around $1.22.

In a heavy saucepan, combine 1/2 cup apple juice and cornstarch; mix
well. Add remaining juice.  Place over medium heat and cook,
stirring, until mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2
minutes. Remove from heat.

In a bowl, beat egg with a fork.  Add 1/2 cup of hot mixture to
beaten egg. Stir until smooth.  Return immediately to hot mixture,
stirring constantly. (The hot mixture will cook the egg.)

Stir in sweetener and cinnamon.  Pour into 4 dessert dishes, cover
with plastic wrap to prevent skin from forming. Cool to room
temperature or chill in refrigerator.

If you prefer to use real sugar, mix 2 TBSP with the apple juice in
the saucepan.  Divide the cooked pudding into 6 small dishes so that
there is approx. 1 tsp sugar per serving if you are allowed this much
on your meal plan.  94 calories, 21 grams carbohydrate estimated.

Strawberry Souffle With Orange Sauce

low cal, deserts, fruits/nuts

      ----SOUFFLE BATTER----
2 pint strawberries
1/4 cup water
3/4 cup sugar
6 large egg whites
1 pinch salt
1  vegetable cooking spray
1  sugar; for greasing mold
      ----STRAWBERRYORANGE SAUCE----
1 pint strawberries
2 tablespoon sugar
3 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon orange liqueur  such as cointreau

FOR THE SOUFFLE: Rinse, hull and puree the berries. Puree the berries
in a blender or food processor. Measure 2 cups puree. (Use any
remaining puree for the sauce.) Combine water and sugar in a 2-quart
saucepan and bring to a boil over low heat. Cook until the syrup
thickens, about 3 minutes. Increase heat and add puree, stirring to
dissolve any sugar which may have hardened when the puree was added.
Bring to a boil and cool. Thirty minutes before serving the souffle,
preheat the oven to 400F and set a rack in the lower part of the
oven. Spray a 2 1/2-quart oval gratin dish or rectangular glass
baking dish with vegetable cooking spray and sprinkle the inside of
the dish with sugar. Whip the egg whites with the salt until they
hold a soft peak. Fold in the cooled strawberry puree. Pour the
souffle batter into the dish and smooth the top of the batter with a
metal spatula. Bake about 15 minutes, until well risen and lightly
colored. Serve immediately. FOR THE STRAWBERRY-ORANGE SAUCE: While
the souffle is baking, combine the sauce ingredients in the blender
(adding any leftover puree) and puree. Place in saucepan and bring to
a boil and reduce for a minute or 2. Serve with the souffle. Vary
this souffle with other fruit or berries--use 2 cups of pureed,
strained fruit as a substitute for the strawberries.

Sugar Free Fluffy Frosting

cakes, diabetic, low cal, low fat

1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon water
2 pkg sweet n low
2  lg eggs
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Combine sugar, water, Sweet N Low, egg whites, and cream of tartar in
top of a double boiler and beat at high speed for 1 minute. Set over
simmering water in the bottom of the double boiler. Continue to beat
at high speed for 4-5 minutes or until soft peaks form.
Remove from heat. Add vanilla to frosting and continue beating at
high speed 1-2 minutes or until thick enough to spread on a cooled
cake. Use about 2 1/2 tablespoons per portion if frosting
individually; or use this amount to frost a 2-layer cake or a 9 inch
square cake, both of which would then be cut into 16 equal servings.
You can change the frosting easily by adding a couple drops of food
coloring and some flavoring, such as 2 drops of red coloring and some
peppermint flavoring. 1 serving = 1 vegetable (1-1 1/2 tablespoons
may be used as a topping for cake or pudding without counting it as

1/2 cup mandarin orange sections - (canned); , drained
1 cup canned pineapple - (crushed or tidb; its), - drained

Combine the instant tapioca, pineapple juice, and orange juice in a
saucepan.  Cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture comes to a
boil.  Remove from heat; add the lemon juice. Cool, stirring
occasionally. Add the fruit and chill until firm.

HINTS: I used the 'packed in their own juices' tinned fruit, and so
used the juice from the tins plus some water and OJ to make up the
difference.

Sweet Risotto With Exotic Bananas

deserts, low fat, bananas

1 cup arborio rice
3  exotic ripe bananas (about
1 1/3 lb total weight), peeled and
1  chopped
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 cup milk
1/4 cup creme de cacao liqueur
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Sprinkle about a third of the rice in the bottom of a 2-quart
casserole dish.  Then sprinkle on a third of the bananas and a third
of the sugar on top of them. Continue sprinkling in thirds until
you're done. Pour on the milk and creme de cacao and sprinkle with
cinnamon. Cover and bake in a 375 degree pre-heated oven until the
liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender, about 1 hour.  Serve
warm.

We discovered that it also tastes good cold, standing in front of the
refrigerator :-)

You can substitute skim milk or evaporated skim milk instead of whole
milk. Also, if exotic bananas aren't available, substitute regular
ones. I used evaporated skim milk, regular bananas, and I think I
left out the liqueur. Arborio is the short-grained Italian rice
traditionally used for risotto. My regular supermarket does carry it.
Perhaps another kind of rice would work.

2 teaspoon granulated sugar
1 each serving non-stick spray(pam)
1 teaspoon powdered sugar, divided
1/8 teaspoon white vinegar
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup fresh strawberries or kiwi
1 tablespoon whipped topping

Use a shallow rectangular baking dish, approximately 6 by 8 inches.
Spray with non-stick butter flavored cooking spray. Line with wax
paper cut to fit.  Spray again with Pam, dust lightly with 1/2 of the
powdered sugar. Set aside.  Whip egg white until firm peaks form. Add
sugar, vinegar and vanilla and whip until stiff peaks form, about 30
seconds to 1 minute more. Spread evenly in baking dish, and cook in
microwave oven for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on high. The meringue will
stretch and spread while baking, but will shrink back to proper size
while cooling, so don't panic! Cool meringue, and turn out onto wax
paper that has been lightly dusted with the remaining powdered sugar.
Spread with the tablespoon of whipped topping, top with the fruit and
gently roll up. Garnish with small piece of fruit and mint leaves.
Another dollop of whipped topping may be used on top with the fruit
garnish, but if you do so, add another 10 to 14 calories to the

Tofu Chocolate Dream Pie

low cal, deserts, bananas

2 pkg mori-nu lite silken tofu firm
3/4 cup honey
3 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup cocoa powder
      ----GARNISH----
1  banana
1  almonds

:       In a food processor whip tofu until smooth. Heat honey 90
seconds in microwave on medium high. Pour honey over cocoa
powder-stir until smooth. Add vanilla. Add chocolate mixture to tofu
and continue blending for one minute. Pour into pre-made pie shell or
custard cups and chill for 1 to 2 hours. Garnish with banana slices.
Mikenote: any berry or nut extract can be used to flavor this pie
but be aware that tofu carries the flavors very well, so be light
handed with any flavor additions.
Mikenote two: I have used the "Oreo" pre-prepared crusts and
the graham cracker pre-prepared crusts with success.....

Watermelon Ice

low cal, deserts, ice cream

1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
4 cup watermelon cubes
2 tablespoon lime juice (or lemon)
2 tablespoon honey
1  lime twists for garnish

In a micro-safe cup, soften gelatin in 2 tb water by heating briefly.
Stir until gelatin is dissolved.

(Suggestion:  cut up melon in a sieve to catch the seeds, over a bowl
to catch the juice or you will have lots of juice around the cutting
board.) In a blender container, combine 1 cup of melon cubes, lime
(or lemon) juice, honey and gelatin mixture.  Cover and blend at high
speed for 30 sec or until smooth.

Add remaining melon in batches, cover and blend at high speed until
smooth. Pour into a 8x8x2" pan and freeze until almost firm.

Remove from freezer and transfer mixture to a large chilled bowl.
Beat at high speed with an electric mixer or food processor until
smooth. Return to pan or pour into serving size cups or pour into
plastic ice cube trays and freeze several hours until firm.

To serve let stand 15-20 min at room temperature. Scrape surface (if
you used 8x8 pan) and spoon into serving dishes. Garnish.
