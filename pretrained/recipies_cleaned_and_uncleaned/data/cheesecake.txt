Italian Lemon Cheesecake

cheese/eggs, desserts, cheesecakes

1 1/3 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
4 ounce neufchatel or light cream cheese
1/3 cup sugar
2  eggs; separated
1/2 cup low-fat milk
1/4 cup white all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoon grated lemon rind
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4  sheets phyllo pastry
1 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter or margarine melted
      ----APRICOT SPREAD----
3 ounce dried apricots; roughly chopped
1/2 cup unsweetened apple juice

1.  Preheat the oven to 325F.  Generously coat a 9" pie plate with
vegetable cooking spray.

2.  In a food processor or blender process the cheeses, sugar, egg
yolks, milk, flour, lemon juice, lemon rind, and vanilla until
smooth. In a bowl whip the egg whites until stiff and gently fold
into the mixture.

3.  Place the 4 sheets of phyllo pastry into the prepared pan,
crisscrossing them on the bottom and brushing each lightly with some
of the butter or margarine. Trim the overhanging pastry leaving a 2"
border all around.

(There's an illustration that I can't really reproduce here that
shows how to place the phyllo leaves. Basically, the bottom 2 are
crossed and then one is placed horizontal and the other vertical.)

4.  Place the filling in the pan, roll the outer edges of the
overlapping pastry toward the filling, tucking it in and rolling it
to create a rim. Brush the edges lightly with the remaining butter or
margarine.

5.  Place the pan on a cookie sheet, put in the center of the oven.
Place a baking pan with 2" of water on the lower rack of the oven.
Bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until set. Remove from the oven and
allow to cool on a rack. Chill for 6 hours or overnight.

6.  Top with the apricot spread, if desired, and serve the pie
chilled, cut into wedges.

*This pie can be baked without the crust as a pudding.

200    calories per serving

APRICOT SPREAD

1.  In a small saucepan bring the apricots and juice to a boil, cover,
reduce heat, and simmer very slowly for 45 minutes, or until smooth
and softened, stirring occasionally.

2.  Allow the mixture to cool slightly, then process in a food
processor or blender until smooth.

3.  Place in a covered container and chill for 4 to 6 hours or
overnight. Serve chilled.

*Other dried fruits such as peaches or prunes can be substituted for
the apricots.

This can be used as a fruit spread on toast, a topping on pies or as a
natural low-sugar flavoring for plain yogurt.

BASIC CHEESECAKE CRUST:

cakes, cheese cake

1 1/2 cup crushed graham crackers (1 package)
1/4 cup sugar
5 tablespoon melted butter

Mix the graham crackers and sugar, then add butter and mix with a fork
until completely moistened.  Press mixture into the bottom and up
1/3rd of the side of a 9-inch springform pan. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Variations:  Use ginger snaps instead of graham crackers for a spicier
crust or for cakes like pumpkin. Use chocolate wafers instead of
graham crackers for a chocolate, white chocolate, or certain
fruit-flavored or ~topped cheesecakes like raspberry, cherry, or
orange. For a sweeter, moister crust (do this only if the cheesecake
is going to get eaten quickly, because it gets mushy faster) use
brown sugar instead of white.

Basic Cheesecake Method & Toppings

cakes, cheese cake

1 no ingredients

Let cream cheese sit out until it's room temperature, nice and soft.
Beat the cream cheese and sugar together until fluffy. Add eggs one
at a time (break them into a separate cup - one teensy bit of shell
will ruin everything!) and beat just until mixed.  Add remaining
ingredients and beat just until mixed. Pour into chilled shell and
bake at 325 for 50 minutes to an hour.

Jam may be melted and poured evenly over the top of the cooled cake.

Fruits may be arranged on top of a cooled cake, then covered with a
melted jam glaze.

4 ounce chocolate or white chocolate chips, melted with 2-3 Tbsp butter
and maybe 1 -2 Tbsp whipping cream (if desired) can be poured on top
of the cooled cake.

For a yogurt or sour cream topping, cook the cake only 50 minutes,
cool the cake 15 minutes, mix together 1 cup yogurt or sour cream
with 1/4 cup sugar (regular is OK since this is so liquid) and 1 Tbsp
vanilla or other flavoring (lemon juice, extract, etc.) raise the
oven temperature to 475 and bake another 10 minutes.

Cheesecake

cakes, cheese cake

      ----CRUST----
2 cup graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoon butter, melted
2 tablespoon sugar, white
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
      ----CAKE FILLING----
1 1/2 pound cream cheese
3/4 cup sugar
3  eggs
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 teaspoon lemon rind, grated
2 teaspoon vanilla
      ----TOPPING----
2 cup sour cream
3 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
      ----GLAZE----
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water
1/3 cup lemon juice
1  egg yolk, well beaten
1 tablespoon butter

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine crust ingredients.  Press crust on
bottom and sides of buttered 10-inch springform pan.  Bake 5 minutes and
cool.

Beat cheese until soft.  Add sugar and blend well.  Add eggs, one at a
time, beating well after each. Mix in the lemon rind and the vanilla, and
add to the mixture. Pour into the pre-baked crust and bake 35 minutes.

Combine topping ingredients, spread on top of cheesecake, and return to
oven immediately. Bake 10-12 minutes and remove from oven.

Combine dry glaze ingredients; add liquid glaze ingredients.  Cook over low
heat until thick.  Add about 1 tablespoon of butter.  Cool and spread this
glaze on
the cake before the glaze thickens too much.

NOTES:

*  Legendary cheesecake -- This is from a dessert-chef friend of a
regular-chef friend and apparently won some award.  I've had cheesecakes
that I think are more impressive (including one I can make), but I think
I'm something of a cheesecake connoisseur. If I want to blow people's socks
off, this is the one I cook. I think that every time I've served it to a
new group, at least one person has said "That was the best cheesecake I've
ever had."

*  Some pointers:  this is the traditional crust, but I often use a more
floury-baked-pie-crust-like one.  It's not too critical.  The magic to
getting the texture perfect is in how you beat the cheese. I use a kitchen
aid, work slowly, scrape the bowl often, and ALWAYS USE ROOM TEMPERATURE
EVERYTHING. Using cold cream cheese guarantees lumps. Don't beat too hard
before putting in the sugar, but make sure it's even and fluffy before the
eggs go in. Then again, don't over-beat. It takes practice.

*  I've been known to make it with no sugar or vanilla in the topping, and
I think it's more interesting. but the contrast between the layers may
confuse those accustomed to restaurant cheesecakes.

*  The glaze is easy as glazes go, but treat it properly.  In particular,
stir constantly until it's thick, but don't stir hard or you'll break down
the starch.

Cheesecake (Belgian)

cakes, cheese cake

      ----CRUST----
2 cup rolled oats (do not use instant oat; meal or steel-cut oats)
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, unsalted (at room temperatu; re)
      ----FILLING----
11 ounce cream cheese (at room temperature)
3  eggs
3/4 cup cottage cheese, small-curd
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix crust ingredients with your hands until
well blended.  Put the mixture in a 9-inch springform pan and form a crust,
pushing it about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the pan. Bake the crust about
10 minutes at 350 degrees F. and let it cool.

Beat (or mix) the filling ingredients, at very high speed, for seven
minutes. The mixture must be very smooth. Put the filling in the baked
crust.  You may want to re-form the crust slightly first.

Bake for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees F.  The cheesecake is done when the
filling is firm, but not dark (burned) on top.  Let it cool, then chill it.

NOTES:

*  A moist cheesecake with a wonderful crust -- A college friend gave me
this recipe, oh so many moons ago. It comes from his parents, and may have
roots in Belgium. It is very different from the typical New-York-style dry
cheesecake.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.

Cheesecake Hints

cakes, deserts, cheese cake

1  cheesecake hints:

Collected by Rita Taule on Prodigy:

1.  Wrapping the pan with foil keeps it watertight.

2. If you grease the sides of the pan first, the surface will not
crack when the cake starts to shrink on cooling. (It always shrinks a
little).

3. Chill thoroughly before unmolding. In fact, I make my cheesecakes
one day ahead of serving and leave it in the springform till I'm
ready to use.

4. The water bath pan must NOT be higher than the springform pan or
it will slow down baking. Also, put no more than 1" of water in pan.

5. Check oven temperature for accuracy.

6. When done, turn oven off, DO NOT OPEN DOOR, let sit for one hour.
Then remove, place on a rack, and let cool to room temperature (about
1 hour). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

7. Use 1 Tbl cornstarch per 2 (8 ounce) packages of cream cheese. Use
Philadelphia brand cream cheese.  It is the best and works EVERY time.

8. IMPORTANT: Use  the egg size specified. If none is specified, use
large (not jumbo or extra-large).

Cheesecake Ice Cream

cakes, deserts, cheese cake

1 single softened, but still cool
1 cup sour cream; cold
1 pinch coarse salt; kosher type
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup superfine sugar
1 cup whipping cream; cold
3 tablespoon lemon juice; fresh

1.  Chill a medium mixing bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer.
In the bowl, beat the cream cheese at medium speed until soft and
smooth. Gradually add the sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, beating well

until very cold. Wash and dry the mixer beaters and chill again. 2.
Using the chilled beaters and gradually increasing the mixer speed
from low to medium, beat the cold ice cream mixture until loose and
creamy, about 3 minutes. Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serve immediately, or
pack the ice cream into a covered container and freezer for up to 24
hours. (Note: If you do this, use a decorative mold!). Allow the ice
cream to soften in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes before
serving. Makes about 1 quart. Recipe from Food and Wine, December, 1991.

3 tablespoon cornstarch
2 pound cream cheese, softened
1  4 8oz. packages
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup butter - 1 stick softened
1 pint sour cream
1  fruit topping optional

Beat eggs in large bowl. Blend in sugar, flour and cornstarch. Add
remaining ingredients blending well after each addition. Blend until

for 1 hour at 325F. Turn oven off and leave cake to cool with oven
door open for another hour. Remove and refigerate.

Note: This recipe does not call for a crust. I usually use a basic
graham cracker or chocolate cookie with butter crust. I have used a
10in pan for this cake as well. This is a very tall cake you can use
more or less sugar to your taste. Decorate with fruit, chocolate
whatever you want!

1 1/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoon sugar
2 pound cream cheese; at room temperatue, cut i
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4  eggs; at room temperature

1. In a medium nonreactive saucepan, combine the cranberries and 3/4
cup water. Bring to a boil over moderate heat and boil, stirring

Drop 8 or 9 rounded teaspoons of the cranberry puree randomly over
the top. Spoon half of the remaining cheesecake mixture evenly over
the first layer and dot with half of the remaining puree. Repeat with
the remaining cheesecake mixture and puree. (Avoid dropping puree in
the center of more than 1 layer.) With a blunt knife, cut through the
batter in a swirling motion to distribute the cranberry puree.
4. Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake in the lower part of the

hour longer. Transfer the cake to a rack and let cook to room

blueberry pie filling over the chilled cake, then chill again. Put about
2-3 tablespoon of your favorite liqueur into the cake filling.

Elaine's Cheesecake

cakes, cheese cake

1 cup sugar, granulated
2 pound cream cheese
2 large eggs
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 tablespoon cornstarch
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1 1/4 cup oreo cookie crumbs
1/4 cup butter or margarine
3 tablespoon sugar, granulated

:       In a small bowl, blend well the graham cracker crumbs, butter
or margarine, and 3 tablespoons granulated sugar. Press the crumb
mixture in the bottom of a greased 8" or 9" springform pan. Place the
pan in the freezer to chill while you prepare the filling.
:       In a mixer bowl, mix the cream cheese and sugar until smooth
and light. I, myself, mix alternately 8 ozs. of the cream cheese and
1/4 cup of the sugar. This is just to ensure it is evenly mixed. When
the cream cheese and sugar mixture is light and creamy, mix in the
eggs, vanilla, and the cornstarch, making sure it is mixed well. It
should be a nice light yellow color. Mix in the sour cream until well
mixed. Pour the mixture into the prepared springform pan.
:       Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the
temperature to 200 degrees and bake for another 45 minutes. Turn oven
off and allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven with the door opened
slightly for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove sides from pan and chill in
refrigerator for another 2 to 3 hours. Then slide the cheesecake off
the bottom of your pan, if you wish.

** You can use the Oreo Cookie Crumbs in place of the Graham
Cracker Crumbs for a wonderfully delightful change. (This is the way
that most of the people order it from me.)

*** Before placing the cheescake in the oven for baking, I always
sprinkle a bit of the crumbs on top for garnish. Really looks nice!

**** Last hint: I put a pan with about 2-3 inches of hot water on
the bottom shelf. It helps to keep the cheesecake from cracking.
Always bake the cheesecake on the middle shelf...NO LOWER!!!

Eli's Turtle Cheesecake

cakes, cheese cake

      ----CHOCOLATE WALNUT CRUMB CRUST---
1 tablespoon butter
1 pkg nabisco famous chocolate wafers (9; oz), fine crushed
3 tablespoon chopped walnuts
1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted
      ----FILLING----
1 1/2 pound cream cheese; room temp
1/2 cup dark brown sugar; packed
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon vanilla
3  eggs
1  egg yolk
1/4 cup heavy cream
5  turtle candies; (nestle or fannie may pix
      ----MILK CHOCOLATE GANACHE----
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon butter
8 ounce milk chocolate chips
      ----GARNISH----
1  pecan halves or pieces

Prepare the crust:

1. Coat the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with 1
tablespoon butter.

2. Combine cookie crumbs, nuts and melted butter in a medium bowl.
Toss until butter is absorbed. Press crumb mixture on the bottom and
sides of pan. Refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes.

Prepare the filling:

3. In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, brown sugar, granulated
sugar, flour and salt with an electric mixer at medium speed until
free of lumps. Mix in vanilla. Beat in eggs and yolk, one at a time,
and continue beating until batter is smooth. Stir in cream and
candies. Pour filling into crust.

4. Bake on the middle shelf in a preheated 325-degree oven until
cheesecake is fairly firm to touch (center will jiggle slightly when
pan is tapped), about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, then
refrigerate at least 6 hours.

5. Remove cheesecake from pan and decorate as desired. Diana Moles of
Eli's research and development staff suggests drizzling the cake with
milk chocolate ganache, or drizzling with Smucker's Magic Shell
chocolate topping or a prepared caramel sauce (at room temperature)
and then sprinkling pecan halves or pieces on top. Refrigerate until
time to serve.

Milk Chocolate Ganache:

Combine cream, sugar and butter in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over
medium heat (do not let boil). Add chocolate chips. Whisk until
melted and thoroughly blended. Let cool. Drizzle ganache over cake
with a pastry bag or a spoon.

Ginger Honey Cheesecake

cakes, holiday, cheese cake, party

      ----CRUST----
1 cup fine graham cracker crumbs (about 8; full crackers)
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter; cold cut into 1/4 inch pi
      ----FILLING----
1 pound cream cheese; at room temp.
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup sugar
2  large eggs; at room temp.
1 1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup golden raisins finely minced
1 tablespoon candied ginger; or more (to taste) finely

Here's the recipe you wanted from Ken Haedrich's Home For the Holidays
cookbook.
Butter the sides only of an 8-in. springform pan. Make the crust by
mixing the cracker crumbs and 1 tablespoon. sugar in a bowl. Add the butter
and rub it in until all of the crumbs are dampened by the fat.
Distribute the crumbs loosely but evenly in the pan and press them in
; pushing them slightly up the sides. Cover and chill while you make
the filling; preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using an electric
mixer, cream the cream cheese, honey, and sugar until light and
fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then add the remaining
ingredients and continue to beat until evenly blended; use the
greater amount of ginger if you want a pronounced ginger flavor, the
lesser amount for a subtle effect. Scrape the filling into the pan
and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool the cake thoroughly on a
rack--it will take several hours--then cover, still in the pan, and
refrigerate for 12 hours before unmolding and slicing.

Note: Ken Haedrich writes, "I have played around some with baking
cheesecakes in a water bath, curious to see if it made any difference
in the final cake. It seems to improve the texture a little bit,
making it creamier. And I'm not sure if this is just a coincidence,
but my water bath cakes don't split on top after they come out of the
oven, perhaps Formatted by Elaine Radis

CHOCOLATE COOKIE CRUMB CRUST: Combine chocolate cookie crumbs with
melted butter and cinnamon. Toss and mix well. Press into the bottom
and partially up the sides of the springform pan. Refrigerate and,
while making the filling, preheat the oven to 325F.

CHEESE FILLING: Put the cream cheese in a mixing bowl and beat until
light and soft. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar and mix well. Stir in the
creme de menthe and the creme de cacao, flour and salt. Beat until
the mixture is blended well. Add the egg yolks and sour cream, and
beat until the batter is smooth and blended. Combine the egg whites
and 1/4 cup remaining sugar and beat until the whites stand in soft
peaks. Fold the beaten whites into the cream-cheese mixture. Pour the
batter into the crust and bake for about 1 hour, or until the cake
has puffed and trembles just slightly when shaken. A wooden skewer
inserted in the cake should come out almost clean, with just a trace
of batter or moist crumbs on it. Don't overbake; it will settle and
firm somewhat as it cools. Don't worry if the cake cracks as it
bakes. Remove and cool. Refrigerate if standing more than 4 hours.

No-Bake Pineapple Cheesecake

cakes, deserts, cheese cake, low fat

      ----FOR CRUST----
12  graham cracker squares (2 1/2; 16 for 10 plate)
1/3 cup grape nuts cereal (1/2 cup for 10 p; late)
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon hazelnut, walnut or canola oil
1 teaspoon unsalted butter, melted
1  (2 teaspoon for 10 place)
1/2 large egg white (1 tb for 10 plate)
2 tablespoon fruit juice or water, or as needed; (1 tb for 10 plate)
      ----FOR FILLING----
1 1/4 cup non-fat vanilla yogurt
1 can crushed pineapple, unsweetened or i; n light syrup (20 oz)
3/4 cup non-fat cottage cheese
3/4 cup low-fat cream cheese, at room tempe; rature
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoon pineapple extract
3 tablespoon lemon juice
3 1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin

To make crust: Position rack in center of oven, and preheat oven to
350'F. Crumble the graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor
and process until crumbs form. Add the cereal, sugar, oil, butter,
egg white and 1 teaspoon juice or water. Pulse until the crumbs are
evenly moistened. Pinch a spoonful of crumbs together, and test
whether they are moist enough to hold the print of your finger. If
necessary, add a few more drops of juice or water and pulse once or
twice. Turn the crumbs into an 8" springform pan or a 10" pie plate
and use your hand or the back of a metal spoon to press an even layer
around the sides of the pan. Spread the remaining crumbs evenly over
the pan bottom. Top with a piece of wax paper, and press to form an
even layer, taking care not to build up the crumbs in the corner.
Bake the shell for 7 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before
filling. The crust firms and crisps as it cools. To make filling:
Place the yogurt in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl and set
aside to drain for at least 20 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl, and
discard the whey. Drain the crushed pineapple in a strainer set over
a bowl. Press the fruit lightly with the back of a large spoon to
release all the juice. Transfer the pineapple to a small bowl, and
reserve 1/2 cup of the juice. Place the cottage cheese in a strainer
set over a bowl. cover it with a piece of plastic wrap, and press
down firmly on the cheese to force excess liquid from the curds.
Place the cottage cheese and cream cheese in a blender or a food
processor. Process for at least 3 minutes, or until absolutely
smooth, with no trace of graininess, stopping once to scrape down the
sides with a rubber spatula. Add the sugar, vanilla, pineapple
extract and drained yogurt. Pulse until well blended. Scrape down the
sides with a rubber spatula, and pulse several times. Add 1 1/2 cups
of the drained crushed pineapple and pulse just to blend. In a small
saucepan, combine the reserved 1/2 cup pineapple juice and the lemon
juice. Sprinkle on the gelatin and allow to sit about 3 minutes to
soften. Then stir the mixture over low heat just until the gelatin is
dissolved; do not boil. With the blender or food processor running,
add the gelatin mixture and pulse to blend. Pour the filling into the
crust and refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight before serving.
Once the top is firm, cover it with plastic wrap.

cakes, deserts, cheese cake

1 cup graham cracker crumbs
2 tablespoon butter, melted
      ----FILLING----
3/4 pound ricotta cheese
8 ounce light cream cheese, soften
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2  eggs
1/2 cup light sour cream
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 teaspoon orange rind, finely grated
      ----CITRUS COMPOTE----

1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

Tip: If cheesecake is exposed to sudden temperature change when

Resist opening the oven door. Be sure to bake the cake in a water
bath; it ensures even, slow, moist cooking.

large square of foil; press foil up around side of pan. Bake in 350F
180C oven for 8 minutes or until firm. Let cool.

Filling: In food processor, pure together ricotta, cream cheese and
sugar until smooth. Blend in eggs, 1 at a time. Blend in sour cream,
flour, vanilla and orange rind. Pour over baked crust.

Set foil-wrapped pan in larger pan; pour in enough hot water to come
1 inch up sides. Bake in 325F 160C oven for 50-60 minutes or until
set. Remove from water. Run knife around edge of cake; remove foil
and let cool on rack. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours. [Cheesecake
can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.] Remove side of pan.

Citrus Compote: Using knife, cut peel and white pith from oranges and
grapefruit; cut between membranes to remove segments. In bowl, combine
oranges and grapefruit; let stand for 10 minutes. Drain liquid into
small saucepan; stir in cornstarch. Bring to boil over medium heat;
cook for about 3 minutes or until thickened. Stir back into fruit
mixture; let stand until cooled to room temperature before serving
with cheesecake.

Petite Cherry Cheesecake

cakes, cheese cake

3/4 cup sugar
2  eggs
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla
24  vanilla wafers
21 ounce cherry pie filling

Beat cream cheese; sugar, eggs, lemon juice and vanilla until light

vanilla wafer in the bottom of each. Fill each 2/3 full with the
cream cheese mixture. Bake at 375 degrees 15 to 20 minutes, or until
set. Top each with about 1 tablespoonful of the pie filling.
I use different pie fillings, and sometimes more than one when
making a recipe, they look very nice on frilly paper doilies, with
the different colors of toppings. If you make marzipan, some green
marzipan leaves look pretty on top, and at times I have made some
little chocolate doodle figures to use with these. Barb Day

Pumpkin Cheesecake (Steamed)

cakes, cheese cake, healthy

3/4 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup ricotta cheese; about 7 oz
1 tablespoon potato starch, cornstarch, or arrow; root
1/3 cup sugar
1/2  lemon; grated zest only
4 large egg whites

"Although Maniere called this a "cheese cake," it's nothing like our
rich, dense American version. His lemony pumpkin-flavored dessert is
low-fat, airy, and souffle-like because it's made with only the
beaten whites of the egg. The cake puffs in the steamer and then
deflates slightly as it stands."

Lightly coat a nonstick 9-inch round cake pan with vegetable oil (if
not nonstick, lightly butter pan and line the bottom with a round of
buttered parchment or waxed paper).

Put the pumpkin puree in the bowl of a food processor. Add the ricotta
cheese, potato starch, sugar, and lemon zest and process until smooth.
Scrape into a large bowl.

In another large bowl, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks. Stir about
one quarter of the whites into the pumpkin mixture to lighten it.
Then gently fold in the remaining whtes. Scrape the mixture into the
pan with a rubber spatula and smooth the top. Cover with aluminum
foil and press the foil around the rim to seal.

Put the pan on the steamer rack, place over simmering water, cover,
and steam 20 minutes. Then set the lid ajar and steam 5 minutes more,
or until the cake is set and a knife inserted into the center comes
out clean.

Let the cake cool, then refrigerate until chilled.

To serve, invert a serving plate over the pan and quickly reverse the
two to unmold the cake. Remove the parchment or waxed paper, if used.
Cut the cake into wedges. Serve cold.

3/4 teaspoon allspice, ground
3/4 teaspoon ginger, ground
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1 pound pumpkin, canned
2  egg yolks
5  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup cream, heavy

MAKE PASTRY:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Grease the bottom and
sides of a 9-inch-diameter, 3-inch deep springform pan.

Prepare the pastry by stirring flour and sugar together in a bowl. Cut in
butter, egg yolk and extract.  Work the dough (which will be very crumbly)
with hands to complete the mixing.  Evenly press the dough on the bottom
and up the sides (to within about 1/2 inch of the top) of the springform
pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
Remove and set aside to cool while preparing the filling.

MAKE FILLING:  Increase the oven temperature to 475 degrees F.  Beat the
cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth and soft. Beat in the sugars,
flour, spices and pumpkin until well blended. Add egg yolks and eggs one at
a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract, beat in
well. Stir in the cream.

Pour filling into the pastry crust.  Bake for 12 minutes.  Without opening
the oven door, reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F. and leave the
cheesecake in the oven for an additional 1 hour and 15 minutes. At the end
of the baking time, turn off the oven, but leave the cheesecake sitting
inside (without opening the door) until the oven cools (about 2 to 3
hours). Remove from the oven, refrigerate overnight.

Pumpkin Cheesecake With Caramel Swirl

cakes, deserts

      ----CRUST----
1 1/2 cup gingersnap cookie crumbs
6 ounce pecans, toasted
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, melted
      ----FILLING----
32 ounce cream cheese
1 2/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup pumpkin, canned
9 tablespoon heavy cream
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon allspice
4 large eggs
      ----TOPPING----
1 tablespoon caramel sauce
1 cup sour cream

FOR CRUST: Preheat oven to 350F.

Finely grind cookies, pecans and sugar in processor. Add melted
butter and blend until combined. Press crust mixture onto bottom and
up sides of 9in. diameter springform pan with 2 3/4in sides.

FOR FILLING: Using electric mixer beat cream cheese and sugar until
light Transfer 3/4 c mixture to small bowl cover tightly and
refrigerate to use for topping. Add pumpkin, 4 Tbsp whipping cream,
cinnamon and allspice to cheese mixture and beat until well combined.
Add eggs 1 at a time, beating just until combined. Pour filling into
crust (filling will almost fill pan) Bake until cheesecake puffs, top
browns and center moves only slightly when pan is shaken, about 1
hour 15 minutes. Transfer cake to rack and cool 10 minutes. Run small
knife around cake pan sides to loosen cake. Cool. Cover tightly and
refrigerate overnight.

TOPPING: Bring remaining 3/4c cream cheese mixture to room temp. Add
remaining 5 Tbsp. whipping cream and stir to combine. Press down
firmly on edges of cheesecake to even thickness. Pour cream cheese
mixture over cake, spreading evenly. Spoon caramel sauce in lines
over topping. Using tip of knife swirl caramel sauce into cream
cheese. Release sides of pan from cheesecake. Spoon sour cream into
pastry bag fitted with small star tip (do not stir before using) Pipe
decorative border around cheesecake and serve. I use the caramel
sauce with the squirt tip to make lines on top, then I pull a
toothpick up and down in the opposite direction to create a web
effect. I have never used the sour cream border and it still tastes
great!!

cakes, cheese cake, sauces

1 1/2 cup fine gingersnap crumbs (about 1/2 l; b. gingersnaps)
3/4 cup chopped pecans or walnuts
6 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
1/2 pound cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup lightly packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree, fresh or; canned (not pumpkin pie
1  filling)
5  large eggs
1/2 cup heavy cream

Here's a cheesecake recipe I intend to try for Thanksgiving dinner. I
found it in the 10/21/91 issue of New York Magazine and thought I'd
share it with all of you.

PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE WITH MAPLE/BOURBON SAUCE

MAPLE - BOURBON SAUCE (recipe below)

Crust: Lightly butter a 10x2 inch round cake pan. Combine gingersnap
crumbs, nut, and butter in a bowl, and mix well. Press mixture firmly
into prepared pan, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Make Filling: In a bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add sugars
and spices, beat until light in texture, 3-4 min. Add pumpkin puree
and mix until just blended. Stir in eggs one at a time, scraping
sides of bowl after each addition. Stir in cream.

Pour batter into crust, and put cake pan in a roasting pan. Add hot
water to roasting pan halfway up sides of cake pan. Bake in center of
oven until cheesecake is firm to touch and slightly puffed, about 50
minutes.

Let cheesecake cool on a wire rack for about 45 minutes. Cover, and
refrigerate for at least 4 hours. When cheesecake is completely
chilled, lower pan into a hotwater bath for 2-3 min. to loosen the
crust. Invert a large, flat plate on top of cheesecake; invert pan,
and remove. Put a second plate on bottom of cheesecake, and turn it
right side up. Cut with a hot knife, and serve with maple/bourbon
sauce.

Cheesecake will keep for 4-5 days in refrigerator and
2    weeks in the freezer.

MAPLE-BOURBON SAUCE 1/4 C. Maple Syrup 3 Tb. Bourbon 1 C. Light Cream
1/4 Vanilla Bean, split lengthwise 3 Lg. Egg Yolks 1/4 C. Sugar 3/4
teaspoon. Cornstarch 1/3 C. Heavy Cream Whipped

Combine maple syrup and bourbon in a saucepan. Over medium heat,
bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by 1/3, about 10 minutes; set
aside to cool.

Put light cream and vanilla bean in a large saucepan, and bring to a
boil. Immediately remove from heat, and let bean infuse cream for
about 10 minutes. Remove bean, and scrape pulp into cream.

Whisk together egg yolks, sugar and cornstarch. Stir in 1/2 C. cream
and return mixture to saucepan with rest of cream. Stirring
continuously, cook over low heat until thickened enough to coat back
of a wooden spoon, 5-8 minutes.

Add reduced maple syrup and bourbon, and strain through a fine sieve
into a bowl set in ice. Stire until completely chilled, then fold in
whipped cream.

Yield: 6 servings

Rules For Baking A Beautiful Cheesecake

cakes, cheese cake

1 x no ingredients

=================================================
RULES FOR BAKING A BEAUTIFUL CHEESECAKE
=================================================

1. Beat cheese and sugar together until very smooth and fluffy and the
sugar is completely dissolved.

2. Beat in eggs 1 at a time just long enough to thoroughly blend. DO
NOT OVER BEAT.

3. To avoid cracking on the top of the cheesecake: Place a pan of hot
water on the floor of the oven during baking time.

Check that your oven is NOT drafty.

Check the accuracy of your oven temperature. A too-hot oven WILL cause
cracks.

DO NOT "peek" at the cheesecake during baking time.

Use the proper size pan. If you use another size pan, adjust the
baking time accordingly.

DO NOT over bake. Baking time IS important.

Run a spatula around the sides of the pan to loosen cheesecake
immediately after baking.

Cool the baked cheesecake to room temperature COMPLETELY before
refrigerating. A hot, or even warm cheesecake, in the refrigerator
WILL definitely crack.

4. Even the non-amateur, following all the rules, will occasionally
produce a cracked cheesecake. If so, simply cover the top of the
cheesecake with one of your favorite toppings and pretend you didn't
notice. The cheesecake will taste wonderful just the same. (I think
that's why so many cheesecakes have toppings anyway!)

Super Double-Cream Cheesecake

cakes, cheese cake

      ----CRUST----
1  box (8.5 ounce.) chocolate
1  wafer cookies
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1  pinch of salt
6 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
      ----FILLING----
3  (8 ounce.) packages cream
1  cheese, softened
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3  eggs
3 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoon bourbon or dark rum
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

MAKE THE CRUST: In a food processor or blender, grind the cookies into
moderately fine textured crumbs.  Add the sugar, cinnamon and salt and
process briefly to blend. Transfer to a bowl, pour the butter over the
crumbs and toss with a fork to moisten evenly.  Gently press the
crumbs evenly over the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.
PREPARE THE CHEESECAKE FILLING: Preheat the oven to 350F. In a food
processor, combine the cream cheese, sugar, salt and eggs; blend
until smooth, scraping down the sides of the container as necessary.
Add the sour cream (see note), lemon juice, bourbon, vanilla, butter,
and blend. Pour the filling into the cookie crumb shell and bake in
the middle of the oven for 45 minutes. Turn off the oven, prop the
oven door slightly open and allow the cake to rest in the oven for 1
hour. Cool on a rack and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. Note: If
the container of the food processor is not large enough, add only 1
cup of sour cream. Pour about half the mixture into a mixing bowl;
add the reamining 2 cups of sour cream to the processor and blend.
Combine both batches in the mixing bowl and stir to blend.

"This is the epitome of cheesecakes - you won't find a creamier,
tastier or better one anywhere.  Don't open the door during baking if
you want to keep the top from cracking. Make this cake at least a day
before you want to serve it to allow the flavors to develop."

Trade Winds Cheesecake

cakes, cheese cake

2 large packages (8 ounce. each) neufchatel; cream cheese at room
1  temperature.
3/4 cup sugar
4 large eggs
1 cup light or regular sour cream
2 tablespoon orange-flavored liqueur *
1 teaspoon vanilla
1  crust (recipe follows)
1  orange sauce (recipe follows)
1 pound (about 1 large) firm-ripe mango
1  fresh mint (optional)
1  * (or 1/2 teaspoon grated orange pe; el)

This is heaven!  Probably the best cheesecake I've ever tasted. I
cheated on the crust++just used a pre-made graham cracker crust from
the market and it worked just fine. I used Grand Marnier for the
orange liqueur. Thank God this is nice and low-cal!  ;-}

In a large mixing bowl, beat cheese and sugar until creamy. Add eggs,
1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add sour cream,
liqueur and vanilla; beat until blended. Pour over crust. Bake in a
325F oven until center of cake jiggles only slightly when gently
shaken, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool completely on a rack. (If made ahead,
cover and chill up until the next day.)

Spoon about 1/3 of the lukewarm orange sauce over cheesecake, to
within 1 inch of sides.  Peel mango. Cut fleshy cheeks off each side
of pit, then cut off remaining fruit. Cut mango into thin slices 4 to
5 inches long. Arrange over cheesecake, overlapping slightly. Spoon
remaining sauce over fruit and cake to within about 1/4 inch of side.

Cover; chill until sauce is set, about 30 minutes or up to 8 hours.
Run a knife around inside edges of pan. Remove pan rim. Garnish with
mint. With a sharp knife, cut cake into wedges.

Makes about 12 servings.

CRUST:

Mix 1 1/2 cups finely crushed crisp coconut macaroon cookies with 1/4
cup (1/3 pound) melted butter or margarine. Press mixture over bottom
and about 1 inch up sides of a 9-inch cheesecake pan with removable
rim. Bake in a 325F oven until lightly browned, about
15    minutes.

ORANGE SAUCE: In a 2- to 3-quart pan, mix 3 tablespoons sugar and 4
teaspoons corn starch. Stir in 2/3 cup orange juice and 3 tablespoons
orange-flavored liqueur (or orange juice). Stir over high heat until
boiling.  Cool to lukewarm.
