  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  skim milk
  1                cup  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4                     egg whites

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Generously spray six large metal or glass muffin molds with cooking spray.  Combine the ingredients and mix until smooth. 
Preheat muffin mold in oven for two minutes.  Pour batter into the preheated cups until two-thirds full.  Bake in the top part of the oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown and puffy.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 large popovers. 
Variation:  To make "cheesy" popovers, add one tablespoon batter into the bottom of each cup.  Add one teaspoon Parmesan cheese on top of batter.  Fill cups two-thirds full with remaining batter.  One teaspoon Parmesan cheese adds 19 calories, scant fat and cholesterol and 30 mg of sodium.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  black currant jam
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Low Fat
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  tiny or medium potatoes
  1 1/2         pounds  beef top round roast -- trimmed of all
                        visible fat
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable juice cocktail
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  24                    baby carrots
  8                     tiny boiling onions or 2 small onions -- quartered
  3                     celery stalks -- sliced 1" diagonally

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  If using the tiny potatoes, peel a strip around the center of each.  If using the medium potatoes, cut them into chunks.  Set the potatoes aside. 
Lightly spray an unheated Dutch oven with no-stick spray.  Add the meat and brown it over medium-high heat.  Drain and discard any pan drippings. 
In a medium bowl, stir together the vegetable juice cocktail, Worcestershire sauce and basil.  Pour the juice mixture over the meat.  Cover and bake for 45 minutes.  Add the potatoes, carrots, onions and celery.  Bake, covered, for 45 to 60 minutes more or until the meat and vegetables are tender. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Leftovers never tasted so good!  Here's a slimmed-down version of Mom's pot roast you can prepare on weekends when you have more time to cook.  Then during the week, just pop the leftovers into the microwave -- in minutes you can serve a nutritious home-cooked meal.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  small red potatos -- quartered
  1                jar  marinated artichoke hearts - (6 oz)
  2               cups  chopped bell peppers of various colors
  6                     ripe olives -- sliced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

Place potatoes in saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil.  Cook until tender -- about 20 minutes.  Drain, cover with cold water, drain again. 
Drain artichokes; reserve the marinade.  Cut the "chokes" into quarters, trimming tough "leaves." 
Put potatoes, artichokes, bell peppers and olives into a decorative serving bowl or platter.  Combine the marinade, rice vinegar and parsley.  Season with black pepper to taste.  Pour over the vegetable mixture.  Toss gently to coat.  Serve chilled. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Instead of a heavier mayonnaise-type salad dressing, the lighter "marinade" from the artichokes is used.

Categories    : Desserts                        Low Fat

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sifted flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  stick margarine
  3        tablespoons  skim milk
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  canned pumpkin
  1 1/2           cups  evaporated skim milk
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  white sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
  8                     egg whites
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
                        === TOPPING ===
  2        tablespoons  fat-free frozen vanilla yogurt

For the crust:  Sift flour and salt together into a mixing bowl.  Melt margarine and cool; combine with skim milk.  Pour margarine-milk mixture into flour.  Stir until blended.  Add cold water, if necessary, to hold flour together.  Form into a flattened ball and refrigerate while making filling. 
Place refrigerated dough onto a sheet of wax paper.  Put another sheet over the top and quickly roll into a 10- to 11-inch circle.  Remove top sheet of wax paper and turn over dough into a 9-inch pie plate.  Carefully remove remaining wax paper and trim and flute edges of dough.  Fill with pumpkin mixture. 
For the filling:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Mix all ingredients for the filling together.  Stir until smooth.  Pour into the pie crust.  Bake for 20 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees and bake for another 20 to 30 minutes (or until pie is just set in the center).  Let cool on a rack.  Add topping and serve. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

                          Quick And Easy Paella

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    mussels -- scrubbed
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  5               cups  water
  1 3/4           cups  long-grain white rice
  8             ounces  reduced-fat turkey sausage -- sliced
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron threads -- crumbled
  4             ounces  medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and halved lengthwise
  2               cups  frozen peas
     1/2      teaspoon  ground red pepper
  12                    littleneck clams -- scrubbed

Prepare the mussels by pulling out the beards that are visible between the shells.  Set the mussels aside. 
Warm the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions.  Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the water, rice, sausage and saffron.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat.  Cover and simmer for 12 minutes, or until the rice is partially tender and there is still plenty of liquid remaining.  Stir in the shrimp, peas and pepper. 
Transfer the mixture to a large shallow casserole or baking dish.  Arrange the clams and mussels around the edge of the dish.  Tightly cover with foil.  Bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, or until the clams and mussels open and the rice is tender.  Remove and discard any unopened clams and mussels. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  This version of the traditional Spanish paella is a lot easier to prepare than usual and a lot lower in fat.  Serve it with crusty bread and a tossed romaine and tomato salad.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PEPPER SHELLS ===
  4                     sweet red, green or yellow peppers
                        === RATATOUILLE ===
  2               cups  diced eggplant
  1             medium  zucchini -- sliced 1/4" thick
  1                cup  sliced fresh mushrooms
  1                can  diced stewed tomatoes - (8 oz) -- with juices
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil - (loosely packed)
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              ounce  reduced-fat mozzarella cheese -- finely shredded

To make the pepper shells:  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Lightly spray a cookie sheet with the olive oil no-stick spray.  Cut the peppers in half lengthwise, then remove the stems, seeds and membranes.  Arrange the pepper halves, cut-side down, on the cookie sheet.  Spray the skins of the peppers with the no-stick spray. 
Bake for 25 to 35 minutes or until the skins just begin to blister.  Remove the peppers from the oven and slightly cool.  When the peppers are cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skins.  Return the peppers, cut-side up, to the cookie sheet; set aside. 
To make the ratatouille:  Preheat the broiler.  Lightly spray an unheated large skillet with the no-stick spray.  Add the eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms, tomatoes (with juices), onions, basil, wine and garlic.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover and simmer about 20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.  Then uncover and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes more, stirring occasionally, until the mixture slightly thickens. 
Spoon the ratatouille mixture into the pepper shells.  Sprinkle with the cheese.  Broil 3 to 4 inches from the heat about 1 minute or until the cheese melts. 
This recipe yields 4 main-dish servings. 
Comments:  Traditionally, this mixture of eggplant, sweet peppers, tomatoes and zucchini is simmered in olive oil.  But by using olive oil no-stick spray when cooking the vegetables, the fat and calories were dramatically lowered while still maintaining the dish's characteristic flavor.

                           Refried Black Beans

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beans                           Low Fat
                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  poblano chile
  2          teaspoons  canola oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2               cups  cooked black beans -- plus
  3        tablespoons  of their cooking liquid
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro

Roast poblano directly over a gas flame or under the broiler as close to the heat as possible, turning frequently, until charred all over.  Transfer to a paper bag; close the top, and let steam for 10 minutes.  Scrape off the skin and discard the core, seeds and ribs, and finely chop. 
Heat the oil in a medium nonstick skillet.  Add the onion and cook over moderately-high heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. 
Reduce the heat to low and stir in the beans and their liquid.  Using a wooden spoon, stir and mash the beans to a rough puree.  Add the poblano and stir until the beans are heated through, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper. 
Transfer the beans to a serving dish and sprinkle with cilantro. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                          Risotto With Asparagus

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/4           cups  water
     3/4           cup  defatted chicken broth
  8             ounces  fresh asparagus spears -- trimmed ,and
                        cut diagonally into 1" pieces
     1/2           cup  grated carrots
     3/4           cup  Arborio rice
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped Italian parsley
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or more to taste

In a medium saucepan, combine the water and broth.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add the asparagus, return to a boil and cook, uncovered, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until crisp-tender.  Add the carrots and cook for 2 to 3 seconds longer.  Remove the asparagus and carrots from the liquid with a small strainer.  Cool the vegetables under cold running water and set aside. 
Reduce the heat under the broth mixture so it is just simmering.  In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the rice and oil.  Place the pan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until some of the grains of rice turn golden. 
Reduce the heat under the rice to medium.  Add a big ladleful of the broth mixture to the rice and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the liquid is nearly absorbed.  Repeat the process with most of the remaining broth mixture, adding a ladleful at a time, until the rice is creamy and al dente, and the liquid is nearly absorbed (this will take about 15 minutes). 
Stir the asparagus and carrots into the rice, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or just until heated through.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the Parmesan, parsley, salt and black pepper. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Risotto is often served as a first course in Italy; and even a little "tasting" portion of this dish is flavorful.  The rice is prepared quite differently from the standard American method:  Rather than cooking it in a covered pot of boiling water, you add hot liquid a little at a time, stirring all the while.  Stop adding the broth when the rice is just al dente; don't worry if a little broth is left over. 
Market and Pantry:  The traditional rice for risotto is short-grained, starchy Italian Arborio, which, when cooked, turns creamy on the outside while remaining al dente within.  Arborio is the generic name; you'll find the rice sold under various brand names in Italian markets and gourmet shops.

In a small bowl, stir together the bread crumbs and parsley.  Stir in the water and oil to make a paste.  Using the back of a large spoon, spread the paste over the lamb.  Bake for 55 to 70 minutes, or until a meat thermometer registers 145 degrees (medium-rare) to 160 degrees (medium). 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  A flavorful herb rub and a crusty bread-crumb topping give this leg of lamb a company-special touch.  We found that lemon juice rubbed on the lamb is an excellent replacement for the olive oil generally called for in a recipe of this type.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  garlic bulbs
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  herb of choice
                        (oregano, rosemary, tarragon)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Cut the very tip off garlic bulbs and gently remove just the loose papery outer layers from the bulbs.  Leave bulbs intact.  Place on end in small baking pan and drizzle with olive oil.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper and herb of choice.  Fill bottom of pan with water just until bulbs are about 1/4 covered.  Seal pan with aluminum foil and bake for about 1 hour or until garlic bulbs are soft. 
To serve:  Break off clove and squeeze pulp.  This substitutes nicely for garlic butter as a spread. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

              Roasted Turkey With Balsamic Brown Sugar Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TURKEY ===
  15            pounds  turkey -- thawed if frozen
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  defatted pan drippings
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. 
Rinse turkey inside and out.  Pat dry with paper towels.  Place breast-side up on a rack in a roasting pan.  Rub the turkey with the oil, a sprig of rosemary and garlic cloves.  Place all of the rosemary and garlic inside the bird.  Loosely tie the legs together.  Place into the middle of the oven. 
When the skin is light golden (after about 1 1/2 hours) cover the breast with a tent of foil to prevent overcooking the breast.  Check for doneness after the bird has roasted about 3 to 3 1/2 hours.  Turkey is done when: thigh muscle is pierced deeply (juices run clear) -- 180 to 185 degrees or breast muscle reaches 170 to 175 degrees. 
Remove turkey from oven.  Let it stand about 20 minutes to allow juices to settle in the meat.  Deglaze the pan by adding 1/2 cup water; stir to scrape up browned bits.  Pour pan drippings into a gravy separator.  Reserve 1 cup of defatted pan drippings for sauce. 
For the Sauce:  Combine the vinegar, defatted pan drippings and brown sugar in a pan or microwaveable dish.  Warm the sauce until the flavor is just released -- 15 seconds in microwave oven, or over low heat on stove until steam "escapes."  (Do NOT boil).  Carve the turkey; drizzle with a spoonful of the warmed sauce. 
Yield: 10 servings (with leftovers). 
Comments:  Instead of adding fat during cooking and serving the turkey covered with gravy, this roasted bird is complemented with a refreshing, aged Italian vinegar-brown sugar sauce.

                         Roquefort Chicken Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  boneless skinless chicken breast -- cooked, shredded
  1                     zucchini -- julienned
  4             ounces  mushrooms -- thinly sliced
  3                     celery stalks -- julienned
     1/2           cup  fat-free mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  nonfat plain yogurt
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onions
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  curry powder
  1              pound  spinach -- stems removed
     1/2         ounce  Roquefort cheese -- crumbled

Combine chicken, zucchini, mushrooms and celery in a bowl.  In another bowl, whisk mayonnaise, yogurt, onions, lemon juice and curry powder.  Pour dressing over chicken mixture and toss to coat. 
Arrange spinach on a serving platter and mound chicken salad in center.  Sprinkle with the cheese. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Talk about a challenge!  Lots of mayo and a generous helping of Roquefort cheese heaped 38 grams of fat into the original salad.  A clever switch to fat-free mayo and a few seasoning adjustments shaved off 33 of those fat grams, creating a healthful treat for fans of Roquefort.

                               Salmon Loaf

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  pink salmon - (7 1/2 oz ea)
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1              large  celery stalk -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  nondiet tub-style margarine or butter
     1/2           cup  quick-cooking rolled oats
     1/4           cup  fat-free egg substitute
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/8      teaspoon  ground celery seeds
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- (optional)

Drain the salmon, reserving 3 tablespoons of the liquid and placing the liquid in a medium bowl.  Remove and discard the skin from the salmon.  Transfer the salmon to the bowl with the liquid.  Use a fork to flake the salmon and crush the bones. 
In a 2-cup glass measure, stir together the onions, celery and margarine or butter.  Cover with wax paper.  Microwave on high power for 2 minutes. 
Add the onion mixture to the salmon.  Stir in the oats, eggs, thyme, basil, mustard, celery seeds, pepper and salt (if using).  Mix well. 
Lightly spray an 8-inch by 4-inch glass loaf pan with no-stick spray.  Transfer the salmon mixture to the dish.  Lightly pat evenly in the dish.  Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. 
Place the pan on a wire rack and let stand for 5 minutes.  Cut the loaf into 1-inch slices and use a wide-blade spatula to remove the slices from the dish. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Salmon loaf is a classic recipe that's easy to prepare and popular with families.  It's also an excellent way to use canned salmon, which is a very good source of calcium because of the small, soft, edible bones it contains.

  2         tablespoon  all purpose flour
  1              pound  turkey cutlets (turkey breast slices) -- pounded thin
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

                       Scalloped Apples And Raisins

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  6               cups  thinly-sliced tart apples
                        (such as Granny Smith apples)
     1/2           cup  raisins
  1 1/2    tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  reduced-calorie tub-style margarine
                        or butter
  1         tablespoon  dark corn syrup
  1 1/2           cups  fresh bread crumbs

In a small bowl, combine the granulated sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon.  In a shallow 2 1/2-quart oven-safe, microwave-safe casserole, mix the apples, raisins, water and the sugar mixture.  Cover and microwave on high power for a total of 5 minutes; stop and stir after 2 minutes. 
In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  Blend in the margarine or butter and corn syrup with a fork.  Stir in the bread crumbs just until incorporated.  Sprinkle evenly over the apples. 
Bake at 400 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the topping begins to brown and the apples are tender.  Serve warm. 
Think ahead:  Even though this dish doesn't take long to prepare, you could make it ahead and reheat individual servings in the microwave.  Leftovers are also good microwaved for just a few seconds. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  Cooking the apples in the microwave first cuts down the amount of baking time needed to prepare this easy apple-raisin combination.  This could double as a light dessert with frozen yogurt.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  reduced-calorie margarine
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                cup  skim milk
  1                cup  low-fat (1%) milk
     1/4           cup  fat-free egg substitute
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice or sherry extract
  2               cups  cooked seafood flaked in large pieces
                        (such as crab, lobster or firm whitefish)
  8             slices  whole wheat bread -- toasted
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Parsley sprigs
                        Pimiento -- cut into strips

In a heavy 1-quart saucepan over low heat, melt the margarine.  Blend in the flour and pepper.  Cook over low heat, stirring until the mixture is smooth and bubbly.  Remove from the heat and gradually stir in the milk. 
Over medium heat, bring the white sauce to a boil, stirring constantly.  Simmer for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Stir the egg substitute into the white sauce.  Heat for 1 to 2 minutes. 
Stir in the lemon juice or sherry extract and the seafood; heat for 2 minutes.  Serve hot over the toast points and garnish with the parsley and pimiento. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Variations:  Replace the whole wheat bread with rice or toasted English muffins.  Garnish with sweet red or yellow pepper rings. 
Comments:  The look and taste are rich, but the content is lean.  Be sure to select a light margarine; it has less saturated fat than butter.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  chopped onions
     1/3           cup  diced sweet red peppers
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  uncooked Arborio rice
  2               cups  defatted chicken broth
     1/8      teaspoon  turmeric
  1 1/4           cups  bottled clam juice -- divided
  1                can  chopped tomatoes -- well drained
     1/4           cup  finely-diced well-trimmed country ham
     1/2           cup  frozen green peas
  1           teaspoon  nondiet tub-style canola or
                        corn-oil margarine or butter
  8             ounces  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
  6             ounces  bay scallops or quartered sea scallops

In a 2-quart round microwave-safe casserole, combine the onions, red peppers and oil.  Microwave on high power for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until the onions are limp.  Stir in the rice.  Microwave on high power for 1 1/2 minutes longer.  Stir in the broth, turmeric and 1 cup of the clam juice.  Loosely cover with wax paper and microwave on high power for 10 minutes.  Stir the mixture well and rotate the casserole a quarter turn. 
Continue microwaving, uncovered, for 7 to 9 minutes longer, or until the rice is almost tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed.  Stir in the tomatoes, ham and peas.  Microwave on medium power (50%) for 2 minutes.  Cover lightly with wax paper and let stand for 5 minutes. 
Meanwhile, in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, melt the margarine or butter.  Stir in the shrimp, parsley, chili powder, thyme, white pepper, salt and 2 tablespoons of the remaining clam juice.  Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes; if the skillet starts to boil dry, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of clam juice. 
Add the scallops and cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer, or until the shrimp is pink and curled and the scallops are cooked through.  Stir the seafood into the rice. 
This recipe yields 5 servings. 
Comments:  This easy main-dish risotto combines the appealing creaminess of Arborio rice with ham and succulent seafood.  Since the rice is cooked in the microwave instead of on the stove, there is no need for the constant stirring risotto usually demands.  This is an eye-catching dish, with turmeric-tinted rice brightened by red peppers, green peas and shrimp.

                       Slow-Simmered Tex-Mex Chili

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground beef round
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped onions
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                can  reduced-sodium tomato sauce - (15 oz)
  1                cup  reduced-sodium salsa
  1 1/2     tablespoon  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
     1/2    tablespoon  brown sugar - (packed)
  2           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3               cans  no-salt-added kidney beans - (15 oz ea) -- rinsed and drained
  2               cups  frozen whole kernel corn

Place the beef, onions and garlic in a large no-stick skillet.  Cook over medium-high heat, breaking up the beef with a spoon, until the beef is browned and the vegetables are tender.  Drain the mixture in a strainer or colander, then transfer it to a large plate lined with paper towels.  Blot the top of the mixture with additional paper towels, then return it to the skillet. 
In a 6-quart crockpot or other slow-cooker, stir together the tomato sauce, salsa, chili powder, vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce and pepper.  Stir in the beef mixture, beans and corn.  Cover and cook on the low heat setting for 7 to 9 hours. 
Think ahead:  Cover and store any leftover chili in the refrigerator for up to 4 days for a speedy lunch or supper. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Enjoy having a hot meal waiting for you when you come home from work.  To keep early morning meal preparation to a minimum, cook the meat mixture the night before and refrigerate it.  Then, in the morning, just add it to the slow-cooker with the other ingredients.

                  Sole Stuffed With Broccoli And Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fresh or frozen sole fillets - (4 oz ea)
  1                cup  broccoli florets -- chopped
  2                     egg whites -- lightly beaten
     1/2           cup  soft-style Neufchatel cheese spread
     1/2           cup  fat-free plain yogurt
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
     3/4           cup  herb-seasoned stuffing mix
  1         tablespoon  evaporated skim milk
  1         tablespoon  dry white wine
                        (or nonalcoholic white wine)

Thaw the fish, if frozen.  Set aside. 
In a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, bring 1 inch of water to a boil.  Place the broccoli in a steamer basket and set the basket in the saucepan, making sure the basket sits above the water.  Cover the saucepan and steam about 8 minutes or until the broccoli is crisp-tender. 
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium bowl, stir together the egg whites, 1/4 cup of the Neufchatel cheese, 1/4 cup of the yogurt and 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese.  Add the steamed broccoli and stuffing mix to the cheese mixture.  Stir until well combined. 
Lightly spray a 10- by 6- by 2-inch baking dish with no-stick spray.  Assemble the fish rolls by spooning one-quarter of the stuffing onto one end of each fillet.  Roll the fillets around the stuffing.  Secure each with a toothpick. 
Place the rolls, seam-side down, in the prepared baking dish.  Cover with foil. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. 
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan stir together the remaining 1/4 cup of Neufchatel cheese, milk and wine.  Cook and stir until heated through.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the remaining 1/4 cup of yogurt.  Cook and stir over low heat just until heated.  (Do not overheat, otherwise the yogurt will separate.)  Stir in the remaining Parmesan cheese and serve over the fish rolls. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Even though most fish is naturally low in fat, many recipes transform this good-for-you food into a high-calorie entree.  This recipe simply switches to reduced-fat ingredients to create a healthier version of this classic dish.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium bowl, stir together the egg whites, 1/4 cup of the Neufchatel cheese, 1/4 cup of the yogurt and 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese.  Add the steamed broccoli and stuffing mix to the cheese mixture.  Stir until well combined. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly spray a 10- by 6- by 2-inch baking dish with no-stick spray.  Assemble the fish rolls by spooning one-quarter of the stuffing onto one end of each fillet.  Roll the fillets around the stuffing.  Secure each with a toothpick. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the rolls, seam-side down, in the prepared baking dish.  Cover with foil. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan stir together the remaining 1/4 cup of Neufchatel cheese, milk and wine.  Cook and stir until heated through.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the remaining 1/4 cup of yogurt.  Cook and stir over low heat just until heated.  (Do not overheat, otherwise the yogurt will separate.)  Stir in the remaining Parmesan cheese and serve over the fish rolls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Even though most fish is naturally low in fat, many recipes transform this good-for-you food into a high-calorie entree.  This recipe simply switches to reduced-fat ingredients to create a healthier version of this classic dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  baking potatoes
  1           teaspoon  oil
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  6             dashes  Tabasco sauce
  6             slices  turkey bacon -- chopped, crisped
  1             medium  tomato
  2        tablespoons  sliced green onions
     1/2           cup  shredded Cheddar cheese
                        Salsa -- (optional)

Scrub potatoes and prick with a fork.  Microwave uncovered on HIGH for about 10 minutes or until tender.  Cool.  Halve each potato lengthwise, leaving a 1/4-inch shell.  Combine oil, chili powder and hot sauce into a small bowl.  Brush this mixture into the insides of the potatoes.  Cut each half of each potato in half again.  Place onto a baking sheet. 
Fill each with chopped turkey bacon, tomato and green onion.  Top with cheese.  Bake in a 450 degree oven for about 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and wedges are heated through.  Optionally, serve with salsa.  Two tablespoons adds less than 20 calories. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

Combine oil, chili powder and hot sauce into a small bowl.  Brush this mixture into the insides of the potatoes.  Cut each half of each potato in half again.  Place onto a baking sheet.

                 Spaghetti With Spicy Italian Meat Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  sliced fresh mushrooms
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped green peppers
  2        tablespoons  snipped fresh parsley
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  8             ounces  ground turkey sausage
  8             ounces  ground turkey breast -- see * Note
  1                can  tomatoes with juices - (28 oz) -- cut up
  1                can  tomato sauce - (8 oz)
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried basil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  ground red pepper
  1                     bay leaf
  12            ounces  spaghetti
                        Parmesan cheese -- (optional)

* Note:  To make sure you're buying the leanest ground turkey available, check the label.  Look for products made with only turkey breast meat.  Many ground turkey products contain the dark meat and the fatty skin. 
Lightly spray a 4-quart saucepan or Dutch oven with olive oil no-stick spray.  Add the mushrooms, onions, celery, green peppers, parsley and garlic.  Cook and stir about 5 minutes over medium heat or until the vegetables are tender.  Add the turkey sausage and turkey breast.  Cook about 5 minutes or until no longer pink, stirring occasionally. 
If desired, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Stir in the tomatoes (with juices), tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, salt, oregano, paprika, crushed and ground red peppers and bay leaf.  Bring to a gentle boil.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cover and gently simmer for 1 1/2 hours. 
Before serving, cook the pasta according to the directions on the package and drain.  Remove and discard the bay leaf from the meat mixture.  Serve the meat mixture on top of the spaghetti. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Here is an old-fashioned, slow-cooking spaghetti sauce that is well worth the wait as it simmers.  It is great to make on a weekend, when you have more time to cook, or to put in a crockpot in the morning before you go to work.

Fill a large kettle with water and heat until boiling.  Add the pasta and cook until "al dente".  Do not over cook.  Remove from heat and drain the pasta.  Place pasta into a large bowl.  Add the olive oil and toss.  Set aside. 
In a large skillet, add the chicken broth and heat.  Add the garlic, tomato and onions.  Cook until onions are transparent.  Add the remaining vegetables and cook for only 5 minutes -- or until tender crisp.  Stir in the basil and oregano.  Pour over the pasta and refrigerate.  Serve on a leaf of Romaine lettuce. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  bread cubes
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  chopped celery
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  dried tarragon
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2           cup  cranberries -- chopped
  1                cup  whole water chestnuts
  1                cup  chopped apple

In a large skillet, sauté the chopped celery and onion in the chicken broth until tender.  Remove from heat.  In a large bowl, combine the bread cubes, chopped parsley, tarragon, paprika, nutmeg, chopped cranberries, water chestnuts and chopped apple.  Stir in the sautéd onion, celery and any remaining broth. 
Spray a two-quart baking dish with nonstick spray.  Spoon mixture into the dish.  Cover; bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes; uncover.  Bake 10 more minutes.  Serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  sweet potatoes -- washed
  2             medium  bananas -- halved
  2        tablespoons  orange juice
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Poke holes in the sweet potatoes in several places.  Bake about 1 hour or until soft. 
Peel bananas; put halves into a baking dish coated with non-stick spray.  Bake uncovered until bananas are soft and juicy (about 15 minutes).  Remove from oven and pour juice over bananas.  Stir to scrape up drippings and mash bananas well.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALAD ===
     3/4           cup  bulgur
     3/4           cup  boiling water
  2                     tomatoes -- chopped
     3/4           cup  snipped fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  snipped fresh chives
     1/4           cup  snipped fresh mint
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  canned chicken broth -- defatted
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced

To make the salad:  In a large bowl, stir together the bulgur and water.  Let stand about 15 minutes or until the water is absorbed.  Gently stir in the tomatoes, parsley, chives and mint.  Set aside. 
To make the dressing:  In a small bowl, stir together the lemon juice, broth, oil and garlic.  Add the dressing to the bulgur mixture.  Gently stir until combined.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to blend the flavors. 
This recipe yields 8 side-dish servings. 
Comments:  This light version of a Middle Eastern grain salad is a great way to help you meet the Food Guide Pyramid's recommended 6 to 11 servings of grains a day.

Categories    : Casseroles                      Low Fat
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  ground beef round
  8             ounces  ground turkey breast
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2               cans  reduced-sodium tomato sauce - (15 oz ea)
  2               cans  no-salt-added kidney beans - (15 oz ea)
                        rinsed and drained
  2        tablespoons  canned diced green chili peppers
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  salt (optional)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1            package  corn tortillas 6" dia - (9 oz)
  4             ounces  finely-shredded reduced-fat sharp Cheddar
                        cheese
  2 1/2           cups  shredded lettuce
  2              large  tomatoes -- chopped

Lightly coat a 13- by 9-inch baking pan with no-stick spray and set aside. 
Place the beef, turkey, onions and garlic in a large no-stick skillet.  Cook over medium-high heat, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until the meat is browned and the vegetables are tender.  Drain the mixture in a strainer or colander, then transfer it to a large plate lined with paper towels, then return it to the skillet. 
Stir in the tomato sauce, beans, chili peppers, chili powder, cumin, salt (if using) and black pepper. 
Spread half of the mixture in the prepared baking pan.  Place the tortillas on top, overlapping them to cover the entire surface.  Top with the remaining meat mixture. 
Bake at 375 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbly.  Sprinkle with the cheese and bake for 2 to 3 minutes more to melt the cheese.  Serve topped with the lettuce and tomatoes. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments;  We took all the wonderful flavors found in tacos and put them into a one-dish entrée.  It's special enough for a party or potluck affair, but it's easy enough for a weekday dinner.
