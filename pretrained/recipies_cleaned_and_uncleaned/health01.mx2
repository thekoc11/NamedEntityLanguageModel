           Apple Stuffed Tenderloin With Cinnamon Raisin Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFED TENDERLOIN ===
  1 1/2         pounds  pork tenderloin -- trimmed of all
                        visible fat
  2             medium  oranges
  1             medium  apple -- cored, chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped onions
     2/3           cup  fine dry plain bread crumbs
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  unsweetened apple juice
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4           cup  raisins

To make the stuffed pork tenderloin:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Cut a pocket in the side of the tenderloin by cutting a lengthwise slit from one side to almost the other side and stopping about 1/2 inch from each of the tapered ends.  Set the tenderloin aside. 
Finely shred the peel from the oranges and set aside.  Then squeeze 3 tablespoons of juice from the oranges.  In a medium bowl, combine the orange juice and apples.  Set the apple mixture aside. 
Spray an unheated small skillet with no-stick spray.  Add the onions.  Cook and stir over medium heat until tender.  Then add the onions and bread crumbs to the apple mixture.  Toss until combined. 
Spoon the bread mixture into the pocket of the tenderloin.  Securely close the pocket with wooden toothpicks.  Place the tenderloin on a rack in a shallow roasting pan.  Insert a meat thermometer into the meat portion only.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the thermometer registers 160 degrees.  Let stand about 5 minutes before slicing. 
To make the sauce:  In a small saucepan, use a wire whisk to stir together 2 tablespoons of the apple juice and the cornstarch.  Then stir in the remaining apple juice.  Cook and stir over medium heat until boiling.  Stir in the reserved orange peel and cinnamon.  Add the raisins and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
To serve, slice the tenderloin.  Spoon the sauce over the slices. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

To make the stuffed pork tenderloin:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Cut a pocket in the side of the tenderloin by cutting a lengthwise slit from one side to almost the other side and stopping about 1/2 inch from each of the tapered ends.  Set the tenderloin aside.

                      Apple-Glazed Barbecued Chicken

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  frozen apple juice concentrate - (6 oz) -- thawed
     1/4           cup  reduced-sodium ketchup
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  hot-pepper sauce
  6                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (4 oz ea)

In a small saucepan, combine the apple juice concentrate, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, thyme and hot-pepper sauce.  Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the sugar completely dissolves.  Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. 
Place the chicken in a single layer in a 13- by 9-inch baking pan.  Pour about half of the cooled ketchup mixture over the chicken, turning once to coat both sides.  Cover and refrigerate both the chicken and the remaining ketchup mixture for 4 to 24 hours. 
Coat a grill rack with nonstick spray.  Then light the grill according the manufacturer's directions.  Check the temperature for grilling; the temperature should be medium-hot.  Place the rack on the grill.  Remove the chicken from the ketchup mixture; discard whatever ketchup mixture remains in the baking pan.  Coat the chicken pieces with nonstick spray and brush them with some of the remaining ketchup mixture.  Place the chicken on the rack and grill, uncovered, for 8 minutes.  Turn the chicken over and brush with the remaining ketchup mixture.  Grill for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through.  Discard any remaining ketchup mixture. 
To broil the chicken instead of grilling it, coat the rack of a broiling pan with nonstick spray.  Remove the chicken from the ketchup mixture; discard whatever ketchup mixture remains in the baking pan.  Coat the chicken pieces with nonstick spray and brush them with some of the remaining ketchup mixture.  Place the chicken on the rack.  Broil 4 inches from the heat for 5 minutes.  Turn the chicken over and brush again with the remaining ketchup mixture.  Broil for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through.  Discard any remaining ketchup mixture. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Although all chicken is much leaner without the skin, skinless white meat has only about half the fat of skinless dark meat.  That's why we chose chicken breast halves for this easy-to-prepare recipe.

Categories    : Casseroles                      Low Fat

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  elbow macaroni
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  sweet green or red pepper -- chopped
  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
  8             ounces  ground turkey breast
     1/2           cup  skim milk
  1                can  reduced-fat cream-of-mushroom soup -- (10 1/2 oz)
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh parsley
  1              ounce  extra-sharp Cheddar cheese -- shredded

Cook the macaroni for 12 minutes, drain and set aside. 
Heat the oil in a nonstick pan and saute the garlic, onions, green or red peppers and mushrooms until softened.  Add the ground turkey and stir occasionally until the meat changes color. 
Combine the macaroni, turkey mixture, milk, soup, pepper and parsley in a 2-quart casserole coated with nonstick cooking spray.  Top with the cheddar and bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  Judicious substitution of this for that trimmed 135 calories and 19 grams of fat from the Clairmont casserole.  After slashing the fat and eliminating the added salt, we gave the casserole a flavor boost with fresh mushrooms, garlic and parsley.  Now you can enjoy the comfort of this casserole, knowing it's healthy eating.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     firm bananas
  3        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        Cardamom or cinnamon -- to taste
     1/2           cup  half-and-half

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Peel and slice the bananas into a baking dish.  Crumble the brown sugar over the bananas.  Bake 5 minutes.  Dot with butter. 
Divide equally onto dessert plates.  Sprinkle with cardamom or cinnamon.  Pour half-and-half around the bananas and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Instead of frying the bananas in butter, this recipe bakes them instead.  Serving them with half-and-half instead of ice cream also saves fat and calories.

                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  turkey breast cutlets
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- (optional)
  2           teaspoon  nondiet tub-style margarine or butter
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1              small  green pepper -- chopped
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  dry mustard
  1              pinch  ground cloves
  4                     English muffins -- split and toasted

Place each turkey cutlet between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.  Working from the center to the edges, lightly pound with the flat side of a meat mallet or the back of a large, heavy spoon to 1/4-inch thickness.  Remove the turkey from the plastic and sprinkle with the thyme, black pepper and salt (if using). 
Melt the margarine or butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Cook the turkey for 2 minutes per side, or until tender and cooked through.  (Do not overcook.)  Cover and set aside. 
In a 4-cup glass measure, mix the oil, onions, green peppers and garlic.  Cover with a piece of wax paper.  Microwave on high power for a total of 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are almost tender; stop and stir after 2 minutes. 
Stir in the ketchup, water, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, mustard and cloves.  Cover and microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. 
Pour the sauce over the turkey in the skillet.  Stir until the turkey is coated Spoon the turkey mixture over the English muffin halves. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  We took classic barbecued pork and replaced the meat with turkey to create a family favorite that'll meet today's healthy eating guidelines.  Serve the barbecued turkey on toasted English muffins, as we've done here, or use toasted hamburger buns or kaiser rolls.

Categories    : Casseroles                      Low Fat

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  mafalda
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  12            ounces  ground beef round
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2               cans  reduced-sodium tomato sauce - (15 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  dried Italian seasoning
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- (optional)
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 3/4           cups  fat-free ricotta cheese
  4             ounces  finely-shredded fat-free or reduced-fat
                        mozzarella cheese - (abt 1 cup)
  4        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese

Cook the mafalda in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until just tender.  Drain, rinse with hot water and drain again. 
Meanwhile, place the onions in a 3-quart microwave-safe casserole.  Cover and microwave on high power for 3 to 4 minutes, or until tender.  Stir in the beef and garlic.  Cover and microwave for a total of 5 to 7 minutes, or until the meat is browned; stop and stir every 2 minutes to break up the meat.  Break up any remaining large pieces of meat. 
Drain the meat mixture in a strainer or colander, then transfer it to a large plate lined with paper towels.  Blot the top of the meat mixture with additional paper towels. 
Return the mixture to the casserole.  Stir in the tomato sauce, parsley, water, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt (if using) and pepper.  Cover and microwave for a total of 8 to 9 minutes, or until heated through; stop and stir after 4 minutes. 
Using a ladle, remove 4 cups of the sauce mixture and set aside.  Top the remaining sauce in the casserole with half of the mafalda.  Add half of the ricotta and use the back of a large spoon to evenly spread the cheese.  Sprinkle with the mozzarella and top with 2 cups of the reserved sauce.  Add the remaining mafalda and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan.  Cover with the remaining 2 cups sauce. 
Cover and microwave for a total of 5 to 6 minutes; stop and rotate the casserole a quarter turn after 3 minutes.  Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan.  Microwave for 1 to 2 minutes more, or until heated through.  Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  You might call this lasagna casserole.  It's made with small lasagna-shaped noodles called mafalda.  If your store doesn't carry them, you can substitute twists, macaroni, ziti or other medium pasta shapes.

     1/4      teaspoon  caraway seeds
  2               cups  uncooked medium yolk-free egg noodles
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  plain nonfat yogurt

Coat a large frying pan with nonstick spray.  Crumble the beef into the pan.  Add the onions, celery, apples and mushrooms.  Cook over medium-high heat, breaking up the mixture with a wooden spoon, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the meat is lightly browned. 
Stir in the broth, thyme, caraway seeds and noodles.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the noodles are just tender.  Stir in the paprika and tomato paste.  Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. 
Remove from the heat, stir in the yogurt and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This quick entree has all the full flavor of a traditional paprikash dish -- without the classic amount of fat.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Low Fat
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  evaporated skim milk
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1           envelope  instant onion-mushroom soup dip mix
                        === BEEF MIXTURE ===
  12            ounces  beef sirloin steak -- trimmed of all
                        visible fat and cut thin bite-sized strips
     1/2        medium  onion -- sliced, and
                        separated into rings
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1 1/2           cups  sliced fresh mushrooms
  1          container  fat-free plain yogurt - (8 oz)
  2               cups  hot cooked noodles
                        Fresh parsley -- (optional)

To make the sauce:  In a medium saucepan, use a wire whisk to stir together the milk and cornstarch until smooth.  Then stir in the soup mix.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.  Remove from the heat.  Cover to keep warm. 
To make the beef mixture:  Lightly spray an unheated large skillet with no-stick spray.  Add the beef, onions and garlic.  Cook and stir over medium-high heat for 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms.  Cook and stir about 1 minute more or until the onions and mushrooms are tender. 
Reduce the heat to low.  Stir the sauce mixture into the beef mixture.  Then stir in the yogurt.  Cook and stir just until heated through.  (Do not overheat because the yogurt will curdle.) 
Serve over the hot noodles.  If desired, top with the parsley to garnish. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This dish shows how well fat-free plain yogurt substitutes for sour cream without changing the flavor of the dish.

Categories    : Breakfast                       Low Fat

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     English muffin
  1              slice  Canadian bacon
     1/4           cup  egg substitute
  1              ounce  shredded light cheese

Toast the muffin.  In a small non-stick pan, warm the Canadian bacon, then scramble the egg substitute.  On top of one of the English muffin halves, place the bacon, then the egg and shredded cheese.  You may broil or microwave until the cheese melts.  Top with the other half of the muffin. 
This recipe yields 1 serving. 
Comments:  Biscuits and croissants are higher in fat and sodium than English muffins.  For variety, add a slice of fresh tomato and onion -- adds negligible calories, fat and sodium.

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  mushrooms
     1/2           cup  chopped sweet green peppers
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1                cup  reduced-fat chicken broth
  1                cup  skim milk
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  poultry seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  diced cooked chicken breast
     1/4           cup  chopped pimientos
  4             slices  whole wheat bread -- toasted
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh parsley

Coat a nonstick 12-inch skillet with nonstick spray and warm over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and peppers, and saute until they are softened.  Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of broth if the vegetables begin to stick. 
Combine the cornstarch with 1/4 cup of the broth and set aside.  Add the remaining broth, milk, pepper, poultry seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, chicken and pimientos to the skillet.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. 
Add the broth mixture and continue cooking until the sauce has thickened.  Spoon over the toast and top with the parsley. 
Variations:  Serve over hot rice or fettucini instead of the toast. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  To achieve its new look, this recipe was put on a crash diet -- which we're happy to announce is completely safe for recipes -- and lost 18 grams of fat in just a few quick testing sessions.  The final result:  delicious.

                 Chicken Breasts Marinara Over Fettuccine

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onions
  1         tablespoon  water
  3               cups  coarsely-chopped plum tomatoes with juice
                        (or a 28-oz can low-sodium tomatoes
                        with juice, cut up)
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped celery
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     bay leaf
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (abt 12 oz total)
  2               cups  hot cooked fettuccine
  2        tablespoons  finely-shredded fresh Parmesan cheese

For the sauce, in a medium saucepan, combine the onions and the 1 tablespoon water.  Cover and cook over medium-low heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  (If necessary, add more water during cooking to prevent the onions from browning.) 
Stir in the tomatoes (with juices), the 1 1/2 cups water, celery, parsley, vinegar, oregano, thyme, garlic and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low.  Gently simmer, uncovered, about 30 minutes or until the sauce is the desired consistency.  Remove and discard the bay leaf. 
Meanwhile, spray an unheated large skillet with no-stick spray.  Heat the skillet over medium heat.  Rinse the chicken and pat dry with paper towels.  Add to the skillet and cook for 4 minutes.  Turn the chicken over and cook for 4 to 6 minutes more or until the chicken is no longer pink. 
To serve, slice each chicken breast half at an angle into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Then arrange the slices, fanning them, on top of the fettuccine.  Spoon some sauce over each serving and sprinkle with the cheese.  Serve with the remaining sauce. 
If there is any leftover sauce, freeze it to serve over pasta as a side dish for another meal. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Gone are the days when a made-from-scratch Italian sauce required several hours of simmering.  This marinara sauce is just as tasty as a traditional one but takes only 30 minutes.

For the sauce, in a medium saucepan, combine the onions and the 1 tablespoon water.  Cover and cook over medium-low heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  (If necessary, add more water during cooking to prevent the onions from browning.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in the tomatoes (with juices), the 1 1/2 cups water, celery, parsley, vinegar, oregano, thyme, garlic and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low.  Gently simmer, uncovered, about 30 minutes or until the sauce is the desired consistency.  Remove and discard the bay leaf. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, spray an unheated large skillet with no-stick spray.  Heat the skillet over medium heat.  Rinse the chicken and pat dry with paper towels.  Add to the skillet and cook for 4 minutes.  Turn the chicken over and cook for 4 to 6 minutes more or until the chicken is no longer pink.

<DirT>
To serve, slice each chicken breast half at an angle into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Then arrange the slices, fanning them, on top of the fettuccine.  Spoon some sauce over each serving and sprinkle with the cheese.  Serve with the remaining sauce.

If there is any leftover sauce, freeze it to serve over pasta as a side dish for another meal.

                            Chicken Cacciatore

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (4 oz ea)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1                cup  finely-chopped onions
  1              large  green pepper -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  dry red wine or nonalcoholic red wine
  1                can  peeled Italian tomatoes - (14 oz) -- drained, chopped
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
  2        tablespoons  snipped fresh parsley -- (optional)

Season the chicken with the salt and pepper.  Lightly spray a large skillet with olive oil no-stick spray.  Add the oil and heat the skillet over medium heat.  Add the chicken and cook about 4 minutes on each side or until browned. 
Add the onions and green peppers to the skillet.  Cook and stir about 2 minutes or until softened.  Add the garlic.  Cook and stir about 30 seconds.  Stir in the wine, tomatoes, oregano and basil.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low.  Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. 
If desired, sprinkle with parsley just before serving.  Serve over toast, hot rice or fettucini. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The original version of this dish just screamed "fat"!  The main culprit: browning the chicken in oil.  The amount of oil was drastically reduced and supplemented with no-stick spray.  The result: a low-calorie, reduced-fat entree that's indistinguishable from its fatty former self.

                           Chicken Cordon Bleu

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  sliced reduced-fat Swiss cheese
  4             ounces  sliced lean ham
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (4 oz ea), pound thin
  3        tablespoons  unbleached flour
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1         tablespoon  light margarine
     1/2           cup  nonalcoholic white wine
  1             packet  low-sodium instant chicken broth mix
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1                cup  evaporated milk

To cook the chicken:  Place one-fourth of the cheese and ham on top of each chicken breast.  Roll up breasts to enclose filling; secure with toothpicks.  Combine flour and paprika.  Coat chicken with flour mixture. 
Coat a nonstick skillet with nonstick spray.  Add margarine and heat until melted.  Add chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes.  Stir in wine and broth mix.  Reduce heat to low.  Cover and cook until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Remove chicken from pan.  Keep it warm. 
To make the sauce:  Stir cornstarch into milk.  Gradually stir milk mixture into pan.  Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.  Spoon sauce over chicken. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Once upon a time, Cordon Bleu was strictly high-brow, fancy-French-restaurant fare -- much too fussy, certainly, to make at home.  Given its nutritional stats, however, it's probably just as well we weren't whipping it up every other day.  The traditional cheese-and-ham-stuffed, cream-sauced chicken dish was loaded with fat and sodium -- 57 grams of fat and nearly 1,000 milligrams of sodium in a single serving!  Which is precisely why we chose to redo it.  And it took some clever culinary finagling, but we were able to give old Cordon Bleu a svelte, new look.  Each satisfying serving of the new and improved version featured here has under 8 grams of fat (that's not a typo) and almost half the sodium of the original, with all the sophisticated flavors you've come to love.  And as a bonus, our recipe is so easy to prepare that there's no reason you can't enjoy this updated French classic any day of the week.  Bon appetit!

                         Chicken Curry In A Hurry

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  nonfat plain yogurt
     1/2           cup  nonfat mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped onions
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 1/2" strips
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  hot cooked brown rice

In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, mayonnaise, onions, ginger and curry powder; set aside. 
Place the chicken in a medium bowl.  Combine the paprika and pepper.  Sprinkle over the chicken and toss until coated. 
Spray an unheated, large no-stick skillet with no-stick spray.  Heat the skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken.  Cook and stir for 3 to 4 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink. 
Stir in the yogurt mixture.  Cook and stir for 2 minutes.  Serve over the rice. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Here's a quick dish inspired by the flavorful curries of India.  This one pairs tender strips of chicken with a low-fat yogurt sauce and brown rice.  All you need to add to make a complete meal is a vegetable, such as steamed zucchini or roasted sweet peppers, and some piquant commercial chutney.

Comments:  Here&apos;s a quick dish inspired by the flavorful curries of India.  This one pairs tender strips of chicken with a low-fat yogurt sauce and brown rice.  All you need to add to make a complete meal is a vegetable, such as steamed zucchini or roasted sweet peppers, and some piquant commercial chutney.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  canned chopped mild green chili peppers -- well drained
  2        tablespoons  reduced-fat sour cream
  3 1/2    tablespoons  mild or medium picante sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2    tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  coarsely-diced sweet red peppers
  1                cup  chopped onions
  3               cups  sliced mushrooms
  1 1/4         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- cubed
     1/4           cup  mild or medium picante sauce
  2        tablespoons  canned chopped mild green chili peppers -- well drained
  1           teaspoon  mild chili powder
  1                cup  coarsely diced tomatoes
     1/3           cup  coarsely sliced scallions
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- (optional)
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  2        tablespoons  reduced-fat sour cream
                        === FAJITAS ===
  8              large  flour tortillas - (8" dia)
  1              ounce  reduced-fat cheddar cheese -- grated or shredded
  1                cup  coarsely-cubed tomatoes -- for garnish
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        Chopped scallions, sliced jalapeño
                        peppers, or shredded lettuce -- for garnish

To prepare the sauce:  In a small bowl, stir together the peppers, sour cream, picante sauce, chili powder and paprika.  Set aside. 
To prepare the filling:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil.  Add the red peppers and onions.  Cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, or until slightly soft.  Add the mushrooms.  Cook, stirring often, for 4 minutes, or until the mushrooms release their juices. 
Raise the heat to high.  Stir in the chicken, picante sauce, chili peppers and chili powder.  Cook, stirring frequently, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the liquid has almost completely evaporated from the skillet; be careful not to scorch the ingredients. 
Stir in the tomatoes, scallions, salt (if using) and black pepper.  Cook for 1 minute; remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream. 
To prepare the fajitas:  Divide the filling evenly among the tortillas and roll them up to enclose the filling.  Coat a 3-quart baking dish with nonstick spray.  Arrange the fajitas, seam-side down, in the dish.  Cover with foil and bake for 10 minutes. 
Spoon the sauce over the fajitas.  Sprinkle with the cheese.  Cover the casserole with foil and bake for 10 minutes longer.  Serve garnished with the tomatoes, cilantro and scallions, peppers or lettuce. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  This favorite main dish is zesty, colorful and satisfying -- nothing is missing but excess fat.  The picante sauce and amount of black pepper used will determine if the fajitas are slightly spicy or fiery.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  bottled barbecue sauce
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (4 oz ea)
  1                     green pepper -- cut into strips
  1                     sweet red pepper -- cut into strips
  4              small  baking potatoes or 12 new potatoes -- thinly sliced
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Tear off two pieces of foil the size of a cookie sheet.  Place one piece of the foil on a cookie sheet.  Spoon half of the barbecue sauce on the center of the foil.  Layer the chicken, green and red peppers and potatoes on top.  Sprinkle with the black pepper.  Top with the remaining barbecue sauce.  Place the remaining piece of foil on top.  Seal edges with double folds.  Bake for 50 minutes. 
Carefully open the packet and check the chicken for doneness.  If the chicken is still pink, close the packet and bake about 5 minutes more or until done. 
To make individual packets, use four 18- by 14-inch pieces of foil.  On one half of each piece of foil, layer the ingredients as directed above.  Fold the other half of the foil over the top and seal each packet.  Bake as directed. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Here's a barbecued chicken meal that's oh-so-easy to prepare -- the chicken, potatoes and peppers all cook together in one big foil packet.  Best of all, there's no messy cleanup!

  1              large  potato -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                jar  green chili salsa - (14 oz)
  1                can  diced green chili peppers - (7 oz) -- drained
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground red pepper
  12                    whole-wheat tortillas - (8" dia) -- warmed
  2             medium  tomatoes -- chopped
  1                cup  snipped fresh chives
     1/2           cup  snipped fresh cilantro - (loosely packed)

Spray a Dutch oven with no-stick spray.  Heat over medium-high heat.  Add the pork.  Cook and stir until the pork is no longer pink.  Add the tomatillos, carrots, onions, potatoes and garlic.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  skim milk
     1/4           cup  canola oil
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1                     egg
  2                     egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2           packages  dry yeast
     1/4           cup  water
  5 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  frozen apple juice concentrate -- thawed
     1/4           cup  raisins

In a saucepan, scald the milk, then add oil, sugar, and salt.  Cool until lukewarm.  In a small bowl, combine yeast with 1/4 cup warm water, let set 5 minutes. 
In a large bowl, beat egg and egg whites well, add flour, yeast, and milk mixture.  Beat until a soft dough forms.  Turn dough onto a lightly floured board and knead about 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic.  Put back into bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Let rise in warm place until double in size (1 1/2 hours). 
Divide dough in half and form into 2 balls.  Cover with plastic and let rest 10 minutes.  Spray an 11- by 14-inch baking sheet with non-stick spray.  In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and raisins, set aside. 
Roll each ball of dough into a 16- by 8-inch rectangle.  Spray dough with canola or vegetable oil.  Cover each rectangle with half of the cinnamon mixture.  Starting at the long side, roll up each rectangle.  Slice each roll into 16 pieces, place on baking sheet.  Let rise until doubled (1 1/2 hours). 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a sauce pan, reduce the apple juice concentrate until syrupy.  Brush each roll with apple juice and poke in raisins.  Bake 15 minutes until golden brown.  Serve warm. 
This recipe yields 32 rolls.

                    Cornish Hens With Oranges And Rice

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  apple-cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  Angostura bitters
  1               dash  hot-pepper sauce
  1                     dried red chili pepper
  1                     jalapeño pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     Cornish hens -- split in half
  2               cups  hot cooked rice
  1 1/2           cups  orange sections

In a large glass baking dish, combine the vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, bitters and hot-pepper sauce. 
Wearing rubber gloves to protect your hands, split both the dried chili pepper and the jalapeño pepper in half and remove the seeds.  Finely chop both, then transfer to a mortar and pestle.  Mash the peppers and garlic into a paste.  Add to the vinegar mixture and combine. 
Remove any visible fat from the hens, especially the cavity area.  Place in the dish, turning pieces several times to coat with marinade.  Cover and refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours. 
To cook, remove the hens from marinade and place on a broiler pan.  Broil 4 inches from the heat for 10 to 15 minutes per side, or until juices run clear when a fork is inserted in thickest part of the thigh.  Baste occasionally with remaining marinade.  (If hens seem to darken too fast, move them further from the heat source.)  Serve with the rice and orange sections. 
Accompaniment:  Serve with a bright green vegetable such as broccoli, sugar snap peas or brussels sprouts. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Enjoy these game hens with the tangy spices at half the calories and a serious reduction of fat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POT PIE FILLING ===
  1                     carrot -- cut thin diagonally
  1                     potato -- peeled and cubed
  1                     onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  fresh or frozen peas
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     3/4           cup  skim milk
  1                can  reduced-sodium chicken broth - (10 1/2 oz) -- defatted
  2        tablespoons  nonfat dry milk
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  ground sage or poultry seasoning
  2               cups  cubed cooked chicken breast
                        === PASTRY ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  stick margarine (not reduced-calorie)
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  4          teaspoons  skim milk - (to 6 tspns)

To Make the Potpie Filling:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  In a medium saucepan, combine the carrots, potatoes, onions, peas and a small amount of water.  Cover and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, or until crisp-tender.  Drain and set aside. 
In a medium saucepan, whisk together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the skim milk until smooth.  Then stir in the broth, dry milk, thyme, pepper, salt, sage or poultry seasoning and the remaining 1/2 cup skim milk.  Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the mixture begins to thicken and just comes to a boil. 
Add the chicken and reserved vegetables; heat through.  Transfer the mixture to a shallow 1 1/2-quart casserole or an 8- by 8-inch baking pan. 
To Make the Pastry:  Place the flour in a small bowl.  Using a pastry blender, cut in the margarine until the pieces are very fine.  In a custard cup, stir together the oil and 4 teaspoons of the milk.  Drizzle the oil mixture over the flour mixture.  Using a fork, toss and stir lightly until the dry ingredients are moistened.  If necessary, add enough of the remaining 2 teaspoons milk to moisten. 
Then, using your hands, gently shape the mixture into a ball.  Place the ball of dough between two 12-inch-square pieces of wax paper.  Gently roll out the dough to an 8-inch circle or 9-inch square to fit the size of the chosen baking pan. 
Remove the top piece of wax paper.  Cut a few slits in the dough for the steam to escape.  Carefully invert the dough on top of the filling.  Remove the remaining piece of wax paper.  Fold the edges of pastry under and flute them.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                     Country-Style Breakfast Sausage

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Brunch
                Low Fat                         Sausage


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  lean pork loin -- ground
     1/2         pound  ground turkey breast
  1           teaspoon  sage
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes -- (optional)
                        Non-stick spray

Ask the butcher to grind the pork and turkey to the consistency you like -- don't grind too fine. 
Mix all ingredients together (except non-stick spray).  Shape into 12 patties.  Spray skillet with non-stick spray.  Fry over medium heat, covered to reserve moisture. 
This recipe yields 12 patties for 6 servings. 
Comments:  You can vary the flavor by switching the herbs and spices.  For a "softer" flavor, try 1 teaspoon rosemary (omit sage and peppers).  For an Italian flavor, try 1 teaspoon of basil and 1/2 teaspoon of fennel (omit sage and red pepper).

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onion
  1                cup  bread crumbs
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
     1/2         pound  flaked crab meat
     1/2           cup  minced celery
  1         tablespoon  Dijon-style mustard
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Spray a roasting pan generously with non-stick spray.  In a large mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients except the crab meat.  Mix in the crab meat, shape into 4 balls and flatten. 
Place the crab cakes on the prepared roasting pan and bake for 5 minutes, turn cakes over and bake another 5 to 8 minutes or until crisp and browned.  Serve with a wedge of lemon. 
This recipe yields 4 crab cakes. 
Comments:  To make cajun-style crab cakes, all of the following spices may be added:  1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/8 teaspoon dried dill weed, 1/8 teaspoon ground coriander, 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice, 1/8 teaspoon black pepper.  The spices will add negligible calories.  You may also substitute imitation flaked crab for real crab.

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Cook the pasta according to the directions on the package.  Drain and set aside.  If necessary, cover to keep warm. 
Meanwhile, lightly spray an unheated large skillet with olive oil no-stick spray.  Add the oil and heat over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and garlic.  Cook and stir about 5 minutes or until the onions are golden brown.  In a small custard cup, stir together the wine and cornstarch until smooth.  Stir the wine mixture and milk into the onion mixture.  Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly.  Reduce the heat.  Stir in the coriander and cook for 1 minute.  Then add the shrimp and scallops.  Return to a simmer.  Simmer, uncovered, for 3 to 5 minutes or until the shrimp turn pink and the scallops are opaque.  Stir in the parsley, salt and pepper.  Serve on top of the hot pasta. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  You'll receive rave reviews when you serve this creamy seafood dish.  To dress up the meal, serve it with steamed fresh asparagus or a tossed romaine salad and French bread.

                      Creamy Shrimp Salad On Romaine

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cooked deveined shrimp -- chilled
  1 1/4           cups  sliced celery
  4                     hard-cooked egg whites -- coarsely chopped,
                        yolks discarded
  3        tablespoons  chopped walnuts
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped onions
     1/2           cup  fat-free Thousand Island salad dressing
  4               cups  shredded romaine lettuce

In a large bowl, combine the shrimp, celery, egg whites, walnuts and onions.  Add the dressing and stir until the shrimp-mixture is coated.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator about 30 minutes to blend the flavors. 
To serve, divide the lettuce among four plates.  Then top with shrimp mixture. 
This recipe yields 4 main-dish servings. 
Comments:  Part of what makes this shrimp salad so easy is using purchased fat-free salad dressing as a timesaver.    Suggestions for dressings: Thousand Island, creamy cucumber, honey Dijon or bacon and tomato.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  powdered sugar

                        Crispy Oven-Fried Chicken

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  chicken pieces - (to 3 lbs) -- skin removed
                        (or 6 boned skinned chicken breast halves)
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  2                     egg whites -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  cornflake crumbs

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly spray a cookie sheet with no-stick spray.  Set the cookie sheet aside. 
To coat the chicken, first roll the pieces or breast halves in the flour to evenly cover all sides.  Then dip the chicken in the egg whites and roll in the cornflake crumbs.  Place the coated chicken pieces on the prepared cookie sheet. 
Bake for 45 to 55 minutes for the chicken pieces or 20 to 30 minutes for the boneless breast halves, or until tender and no longer pink.  (Do not turn the chicken over during baking.) 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Just the simple step of switching to "oven frying" made this all-American favorite healthier.

  2        tablespoons  margarine
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped onion
  1                cup  finely-chopped celery
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  6        tablespoons  curry powder
  3               cups  canned tomatoes -- drained
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
  1                cup  long-grain rice
  6               cups  unsalted chicken broth
  1                cup  skim milk
