 Categories: Crepes, Cheeses, Masterchefs, New york, 1fa
      Yield: 4 servings
 
--------------------------------CREPE BATTER--------------------------------
      2    Eggs                                     Salt (to taste)
    1/2 c  Milk                                     Pepper, white (to taste)
    1/2 c  Water, or more                      2 tb Butter, clarified **
      1 c  Flour, all purpose, sifted               Oil, Olive

-------------------------------FRITTER BATTER-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Flour, all purpose                  1    Egg
      2 tb Cornstarch                        1/4 c  Water or more
      1 ts Baking powder                     1/2 ts Oil, vegetable
    1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  For Crepes:
  ===========
  
       Combine the eggs, milk and a 1/2 cup of water together.
  Gradually add 1 cup of flour, whisking it in until smooth.
  
       Whisk in the salt and pepper and Clarified butter.  Thin with
  water, if necessary, to the consistency of whipping cream.  Cover
  and refrigerate for several hours or overnight.
  
       If the crepe batter has thickened in the refrigerator, thin it
  with water to the consistency of whipping cream.  Brush a 7-inch
  skillet (preferably non stick) with a thin film of olive oil.  Place
  the skillet over medium-high heat.  When hot, add about 3
  tablespoons of crepe batter and swirl to coat the pan.  Cook until
  the crepe is lightly golden, about 1 minute; then turn it over and
  cook the second side for 30 seconds.  Continue with remaining
  batter, stacking crepes between waxed paper.
  
  For Fritter Batter:
  ===================
  
       Sift 1/4 cup of flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt into
  a mixing bowl.  In a second bowl, combine an egg, 1/4 cup of water
  and vegetable oil and mix.  Gradually stir the liquid mixture into
  the flour and mix just until smooth.  DO NOT OVER MIX.  Refrigerate,
  covered.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 x  Apple Puree **                      1 x  Fritter Batter **
      1 x  Crepe Batter **               

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      4 oz Cheese, Roquefort,              1 1/2 ts Egg yolk
           -- crumbled (about 1 cup)                Oil, vegetable (for deep
           -- room temperature                      -- frying
 
       ** See recipes for Roquefort Beignets with Apple Puree I (Puree)
  and Roquefort Beignets with Apple Puree II (Batters).  These
  ingredients should be accomplished before completing this recipe.
  
  For Filling:
  ============
  
       Blend the Roquefort cheese and egg yolk (mixture will by lumpy).
  
  To Assemble and Cook:
  =====================
  
       Cut off any dry edges from the crepes, squaring them slightly.
  Place a rounded teaspoonful of cheese mixture in the center of the
  spotty side of a crepe, mounding it slightly.
  
       Fold the crepe into thirds horizontally (as you would a letter),
  then fold the sides in so that they overlap slightly, forming a neat
  package about 2 inches square.  Place these packets folded side down
  on a tray lined with waxed paper; repeat with remaining crepes and
  filling.
  
       Cover the folded crepes with a damp cloth, then with plastic
  wrap, then with aluminum foil.  Chill several hours or overnight.
  
       In a large skillet or saucepan, pour in 2 inches of vegetable
  oil and heat to 375 F (a small piece of bread dropped into oil
  sizzles steadily at this temperature.)
  
       Thin the fritter batter with water, if necessary, so that it
  flows from a spoon but is not watery.  Use 2 forks to dip folded
  crepes into fritter batter; then lift them out, letting any excess
  batter drain off, and transfer to the hot oil ( do not crowd.)
  
       Fry until golden, turning once, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Drain on
  paper towels and serve with Apple Puree.
  
       This recipe makes 12 beignets (three per serving.)

      Title:  Clarified Butter - Master Chefs
 Categories: Basics, Oils, Masterchefs, New york
      Yield: 6 fl. ounces
 
    1/2 lb Butter, unsalted               
 
       Cut any amount of unsalted butter into pieces and melt slowly in
  saucepan.  Skim off as much foam as possible from surface.  Carefully
  pour off all clear golden liquid (this is the clarified butter),
  leaving all milky residue in bottom of pan (discard residue.)
  
       Clarified butter keeps well, tightly sealed, in refrigerator or
  freezer.  One half pound of butter (2 sticks) yields about 3/4 cup
  clarified butter.

      3 ea Celery ***                          6 c  Water, cold (approximately)
      2 sm Leeks ***                         1/4 ts Salt (or to taste)
      6 ea Parsley stems                       4 ea Clams
      2 ea Garlic, cloves, crushed,            8 ea Oysters, shucked
           -- peeled                           1 oz Mung bean threads **
      2 ea Bay leaves                          8 ea Radicchio leaves
    1/2 ts Juniper, berries                  1/4 ts Saffron threads
  
  
       ** Soak the mung bean threads (also called cellophane noodles) in
  hot water for twenty minutes.  Drain, and cut into 2-inch lengths.
  Set aside.
  
       *** Split the carrots, celery and leeks lengthwise in half.  Clean,
  peel, and slice the vegetables into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
  
       Melt the butter in a stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add the
  onions, carrots, leeks, parsley, garlic, bay leaves and juniper
  berries, tossing the mixture well to coat with butter.  When the
  vegetables begin to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium low and cover.
  Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
  
       Add the tomato to the stockpot and stir for 1 minute.  Add the
  fish bones and trimmings and white wine.  Cook this mixture for 5
  minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add cold water to cover and raise
  heat to medium high.  Bring to a boil, skimming all of the froth
  from the surface as it forms.  Immediately lower heat and simmer
  gently, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes.  Strain the mixture,
  pressing the solids firmly to extract all liquid.  Discard the
  solids.  Add salt to taste.
  
       Heat 4 cups fish broth in a saucepan.  Steam clams separately in
  small amount of broth just until shells open, removing each shell as
  it opens.  Transfer to 4 warm soup bowls; strain clam broth into warm
  fish broth, avoiding any grit at the bottom.
  
       Add oysters to fish broth and cook gently over low heat,
  uncovered, just until edges curl, about 1 minute.  Place 2 oysters in
  each bowl.  Ladle warm broth into bowls and add 2 tablespoons mung
  bean threads.  Add radicchio leaves and saffron and serve.

      1 ts Oregano, fresh OR                        Roast Beef Puree **
    1/2 ts Oregano, dried                           Spinach ***
      5 ea Bay, leaves, crumbled                    Beet Greens ***
 
       ** See recipes for Brown Chicken Stock and Roast Beef Puree.
  
       *** Blanch 1 1/2 pounds of fresh spinach, stems removed, and
  reserved greens from 4 beets.  Drain, rinse under cold water and
  squeeze out all of the liquid.  Toss the greens in a skillet over
  medium-high beat with 2 tablespoons of butter and until heated
  through.  Season with salt.
  
  To Marinate:
  ============
  
       You can do this yourself, or you can ask your butcher to cut up your
  rabbit as follows: forelegs left whole, hind legs cut into 3 pieces each
  (lower joint; thigh cut diagonally into 2 pieces), rib section cut into 3
  pieces, loin cut into 3 pieces, neck left whole. At least 2 days before
  serving, place the rabbit in a shallow glass or enamel pan and add
  marinade ingredients.  Turn rabbit pieces over to coat.  Marinate,
  covered, in refrigerator, turning occasionally.
  
       Preheat you oven to 325 F. Remove the rabbit from the marinade. In a
  heavy large skillet, heat about 1/4 cup of olive oil over medium-high
  heat.  Add half of the rabbit pieces and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
  Saute, turning pieces once, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Transfer
  to oven-proof casserole.  Discard fat from skillet and add 1/2 cup of
  white wine, scraping up all of the browned bits in the pan.  Boil for 2
  minutes and add the liquids out of the skillet to the casserole.  Repeat
  the procedure, browning the remaining rabbit, deglazing and adding rabbit
  and liquid to the casserole.
  
       Bring the brown chicken stock to a boil; skim, if necessary, and pour
  it into the casserole (liquid should not quite cover meat). Place the
  casserole, partially covered, in the lower third of the oven.  After 50
  minutes, check the forelegs, racks and loins.  If they are tender, remove
  them.  Continue cooking until all of the remaining pieces are tender, 1 to
  1 1/2 hours total cooking time (timing can vary depending on size and
  tenderness of the rabbit). Transfer to serving plates and keep warm.
  
       Meanwhile, blanch the garlic in boiling salted water for 30 seconds;
  drain.  Blanch again for 30 seconds, drain.  Place in a small skillet with
  1 tablespoon of olive oil and saute over high heat for 1 minute.
  
       Place the skillet in the oven until the garlic is golden, 25 to 30
  minutes.  Cut each clove into 3 or 4 pieces; set aside.
  
       When the rabbit is tender, place the skillet with cooking liquid over
  high heat and boil until reduced by half, about 15 minutes.  Skim all of
  the fat from the surface.  In a small cup, stir together the arrowroot and
  water; whisk the mixture into the reduced cooking liquid and return to a
  boil.  Add brandy, adjust seasonings with salt and pepper, and skim again
  if necessary.  Stir in the reserved garlic pieces, and pour over the
  rabbit.
  
       Serve your rabbit with Roast Beef Puree, spinach and beet greens.

      2 lg Egg yolks                                Salt (to taste)
      2 ts Mustard, Dijon                           Pepper, white (to taste)
      1 md Lemon, juice of                     1 c  Oil, olive, extra-virgin
 
  ** See recipe for Puff Pastry.
  
  For the pastry cornets:
  =======================
  
       Roll the pastry out onto a lightly floured work surface to 3" x
  20" rectangle, 1/4" thick.  Cut the rectangle into 4 long strips, each
  3/4" wide.
  
       Wrap each strip around a long metal cone (which can be made from
  heavy-duty aluminum foil), beginning at the tip and rolling the strip
  around and around, overlapping slightly.  Place these on an ungreased
  baking sheet and refrigerate for 1 hour or more.
  
       Preheat oven to 375 F.
  
       Bake pastry cornets until golden, about 15 minutes.
  
       Cool briefly, then very carefully the metal or foil cones.
  
  For the lemon dressing:
  =======================
  
       Combine the egg yolks, mustard, lemon juice, and salt and pepper.
  Whisk in the oil a drop at a time.  When the dressing begins to
  thicken, add the oil 1 teaspoon at a time, then continue adding oil in
  a thin stream.
  
       Adjust seasonings to taste.
  
       Cook the asparagus, tied in bundles, in boiling salted water
  until it's just crisp-tender; drain.
  
  Construction:
  =============
  
       Pour a small amount of dressing on each serving plate.
  
       Place a cornet on top of the dressing and tuck the asparagus into
  the ends of the cornet, fanning the tips outward.

      Title:  Puff Pastry - Master Chefs
 Categories: Basics, Pastries, Masterchefs, New york, 24fa
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
      4 c  Flour, all purpose                  1 lb Butter, unsalted, chilled,
  1 1/2 ts Salt                                     -- cut into pieces
      1 c  Water, cold                    
 
       This recipe produces a "double batch" for most recipes in the
  database.  Cut all of the ingredients in half if you're only doing one
  recipe.
  
       Set aside about 1/2 cup of flour on a work surface.
  
       Place the remaining flour with the salt in a mixing bowl or
  mixer.
  
       Add 1/4 c (1/2 stick) of the butter and cut the mixture together
  until crumbly.
  
       Add just enough cold water so mixture can be gathered together in
  a ball.
  
       Cut a cross into the top of the ball, and place it in a covered
  bowl and chill for about 30 minutes.
  
       Place the remaining butter on the work surface with the reserved
  flour.  Toss the butter to coat.
  
       Use the heel of your hand to work the flour into the butter then
  place the butter-flour mixture on a sheet of waxed paper, cover with a
  second sheet and press the mixture into a flat square.
  
       Refrigerate just until the butter-flour mixture is approximately
  the same consistency as refrigerated dough.
  
       Roll the dough into a cloverleaf shape, with 4 "leaves" extending
  diagonally from the center.  Place the butter flour mixture in the
  center, then fold each "leaf" over, forming a neat, square package
  with the leaves slightly overlapping.
  
       Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a large
  rectangle with the short end toward you.
  
       Fold into thirds as you would a letter.  Rotate the dough 1/4
  turn so that the open side is at the right (this is called a single
  turn).
  
       Repeat rolling the dough into a large rectangle, folding into
  thirds and rotating 1/4 turn.
  
       Wrap dough and chill 1 hour or longer.
  
       Give the dough 2 more sets of 2 single turns, always beginning
  and ending with the open side at the right.
  
       Refrigerate 1 hour or longer between each set of 2 turns.
  
       After final set of turns (6 single turns in all), wrap and
  refrigerate dough again for at least 1 hour.

 Categories: Pastas, Masterchefs, New york, 24fa
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Parsley, chopped (garnish)     
 
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Place 1 sheet of the prepared dough on ravioli form or work
  surface.  Dot with 18 teaspoonfuls of filling placed 1 inch apart.
  Using a pastry brush dipped in cold water, moisten dough between
  mounds of filling.
  
       Gently lay a second sheet of pasta on top of the first sheet with
  its mounds of filling, pressing between carefully between the mounds
  of filling to seal the two sheets together.  Cut the dough into neat
  squares.  Repeat, using remaining 2 sheets of pasta and remaining
  filling.  Set aside on lightly floured baking sheet.
  
       Preheat oven to 450 F.  Bring the cream and remaining 1/2 cup of
  chopped shallot to a simmer then set aside.
  
       Cook the ravioli in large pot of boiling salted water for 2
  minutes.  Drain and immediately transfer to wide, shallow baking dish.
  
       Pour the cream and shallot over the ravioli and bake until the
  cream is bubbly and has thickened slightly, 5 to 8 minutes.
  
       Meanwhile, place the trimmed sweetbreads and Bordelaise Sauce or
  Veal Stock in small saucepan.  Simmer, uncovered, until the mixture is
  reduced to syrupy consistency.
  
       Transfer ravioli and cream to warm serving plates.  Spoon a few
  pieces of sweetbreads with their sauce into the center of each
  portion.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve immediately.

           -- green parts)                
 
       Preheat oven to 450 F.
  
       Put the oil in a roasting pan and heat briefly in the oven.
  
       Add the bones to the oil in the pan, toss to coat and roast for
  35 minutes.
  
       Add the onions, carrots, celery, leek, garlic and parsley,
  tossing them all to coat with fat.  Roast 30 minutes longer.
  
       Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the bones and
  vegetables to a clean stockpot.  Drain off as much of the fat as
  possible.
  
       Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat (use 2 burners if
  neces-) (sary), and add 2 cups of cold water and boil briefly.  Scrape
  up all of the browned bits into the water.
  
       Transfer the liquid to the stock pot and add enough cold water to
  cover.  Bring slowly to a boil, skimming off all of the froth that
  forms.
  
       Lower the heat and add tomatoes, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and
  salt.  Simmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours adding water as necessary
  just to cover the ingredients.  Skim whenever necessary.
  
       Add peppercorns for the last 15 minutes of the simmering.
  
       Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through a colander lined with
  a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gently press the solids to
  extract all of the liquid, and discard the solids.
  
       Pour the stock into containers for storage and label and date
  them.
  
       The stock will "keep" for up to 3 days in a refrigerator, and up
  to 6 months in a freezer.

    1/4 c  Sugar                                    Blanched vegetables ***
 
       ** See recipes for Duck Stock and Veal Stock.
  
       *** An assortment of blanched vegetables should be used as
  garnish for this dish.  You might consider using green beans,
  asparagus, broccoli, or julienne of carrots, zucchini, turnips, tied
  into bundles with strips of blanched leek
  
       Place the duck, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 4 days to dry
  out the skin.
  
       Preheat the oven to 500 F.
  
       Cut off the tail and excess neck skin from the ducks and remove
  all excess fat.  Place the ducks, breasts up on a rack in a roasting
  pan.  Tuck wing tips under.  Roast until crisp and well browned, about
  1 hour.
  
       With a sharp paring knife, remove a thin slice from the top and
  bottom of each grapefruit, then remove the skin of the fruit in long
  strips.  Set aside.
  
       Cutting between the membrane, cut the grapefruit into sections
  and set aside.
  
       Place the sugar and wine vinegar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan.
  Cook over medium high heat until the vinegar has evaporated and the
  sugar has caramelized lightly.
  
       Carefully add the stock and bring the mixture to a boil.  Simmer
  at low boil for 5 minutes.
  
       Add grapefruit skins to the mixture and simmer 3 minutes longer.
  
       Strain the mixture into a clean saucepan and simmer until reduced
  enough to coat a spoon lightly.
  
       Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and keep it warm.
  
       Transfer the duck to a work surface.  Run a sharp knife under the
  wishbone at the front of the duck's breast, then carefully slip the
  knife between each breast half and carcass.  Remove the breasts, and
  then take off the legs and thighs in one piece.
  
       Lightly coat a warm serving plate with the sauce.  Place the duck
  over the sauce and arrange the grapefruit sections, overlapping, on
  top.  Garnish with blanched vegetables as desired, and serve, passing
  the rest of the sauce around separately.

  For Creme Anglaise:
  ===================
  
       Bring milk and cream to boil in heavy saucepan.
  
       Meanwhile, beat egg yolks and sugar in mixer,until pale yellow
  and forms a ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 7 minutes.
  
       Slowly pour 1 cup of hot liquid into yolks, beating constantly.
  
       Transfer yolk mixture to milk and cream in saucepan and stir
  constantly over medium-low heat until it thickens enough to coat the
  back of a spoon.  DO NOT BOIL.
  
       Strain into a large bowl set into a larger bowl of ice water and
  cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.  Cover and
  refrigerate for at least two hours.
  
  For Mousse:
  ===========
  
       Heat sugar and water in heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until
  sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally and brushing down any crystals
  from sides 2of pan with brush dipped in cold water.  Increase heat and
  boil until mixture registers 240 F (soft ball stage) on a candy
  thermometer.
  
       Meanwhile, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks
  form.
  
       Slowly pour in hot syrup, beating until mixture is cool, about 5
  minutes
  
       Gently fold in whipped cream, cocoa, melted chocolate and
  espresso.
  
       Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
  
  For Chocolate Flowers:
  ======================
  
       Line a jelly roll pan with waxed paper.  Melt chocolate with corn
  syrup, stirring until smooth.  Pour into prepared pan and spread with
  metal spatula to thickness of 1/4 inch.  Cool to room temperature.
  
       Transfer paper with chocolate to work surface.  Place second
  sheet of waxed paper over chocolate.  Roll chocolate to 1/8 inch
  thickness.  Cut into twenty 1-inch rounds with a cookie cutter.  Roll
  1 chocolate round into tight funnel shape for center of flower.
  Gather 3 more rounds around center, forming petals.  Squeeze together
  at base.  Place on a waxed paper-lined plate.  Repeat with remaining
  chocolate, forming 5 flowers.  Refrigerate until flowers are firm.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Divide creme anglaise among five 2 cup cachepots or other
  porcelain dishes shaped like a flowerpot.  Top with chocolate mousse,
  mounding slightly in center.  Set chocolate flower atop each (to
  anchor flowers more securely, place on lollipop sticks, then insert in
  mousse.)
  
       Refrigerate until 20 minutes before serving.
  
       Each flowerpot makes two servings.

      3    Egg whites                               -- sliced into 1/2-inch
      2 c  Cream, whipping                          -- thick slices
    1/2 c  Parsley, chopped              

----------------------------------DRESSING----------------------------------
      2    Egg yolks                           2 c  Cream, sour
      1 tb Water, cold                       1/4 c  Champagne OR
      1 c  Oil, vegetable                    1/4 c  Wine, white, dry (opt)
      2 tb Oil, vegetable                      2 ts Salt (or to taste)
      6 tb Vinegar, white wine               1/2 ts Pepper, black, ground

---------------------------------GARNISHES---------------------------------
      2    Eggs, cooked, hard                  4 oz Caviar, golden (fresh white
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped                    -- fish roe)
    1/4 c  Parsley, chopped                    4 oz Caviar, sturgeon
 
  For Mousse:
  ===========
  
       Process fish fillets, smoked white fish, and egg yolks to smooth
  puree in processor, working in batches as necessary and scraping down
  sides occasionally.  Add egg whites one by one, blending well.  Gradually
  add cream, scraping sides of bowl as needed.  Transfer mousse to bowl and
  place bowl in a larger bowl of ice.  Stir in 1/2 cup parsley, hot pepper
  sauce, salt and a pinch of pepper.  Adjust seasonings to taste and chill
  well.
  
       Lightly butter a 12 x 3 x 4-inch ceramic terrine (a standard 9 x
  3-inch loaf pan can also be used).  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Place well
  chilled smoked salmon on work surface and split it down center, removing
  any small bones.  Cut each half into rectangles about 2 inches wide and
  the length of the mold, squaring off edges neatly.  Cut two rectangles of
  smoked sturgeon to the same size.
  
       Use a rubber spatula to spread 1/4 inch layer of mousse evenly over
  the bottom and sides of the mold.  Lay one rectangle of smoked salmon down
  the center.  Spread a 1/2 inch thick layer of mousse over the salmon,
  smoothing neatly.  Top with a layer of smoked sturgeon, then 1/2 inch
  layer of mousse; repeat until mold is filled, ending with smooth layer of
  mousse.  Tap filled pan gently on work surface to eliminate air bubbles.
  Top with buttered aluminum foil, buttered side down.  Wrap a second layer
  of foil over top and place mold in a roasting pan.
  
       Place the pan on the center rack of your oven and pour hot water into
  roasting pan to come about halfway up outside of terrine.  Bake 45 to 60
  minutes, or until a skewer inserted in center comes out clean (a 9 x 3
  inch mold may take as long as 1 hour and 10 minutes.)  Remove the mold
  from the water bath and cool on rack.
  
  For Dressing:
  =============
  
       Place egg yolks and water in bowl of mixer and beat until creamy.  Add
  oil very slowly.  When about half of the oil has been incorporated, begin
  alternating oil and vinegar, adding them in a thin stream.  Whisk in sour
  cream briefly, then Champagne.  Add salt and pepper and chill dressing,
  thinning, if necessary, with a little milk.
  
       To garnish; separate the hard cooked egg yolks from egg whites and
  chop each coarsely.  Use a napkin to press whites and yolks separately
  through a sieve.
  
       To serve, run a knife around the edges of the terrine, then unmold by
  inverting it onto a serving platter.  Holding a kitchen towel dipped in
  hot water over the mold for a few seconds, lift off the mold.  Slice the
  terrine with a knife dipped in cold water.  Cover the bottom of each
  chilled serving plate with dressing.  Center a slice of terrine on each
  plate. Surround the terrine with a ring of chopped egg yolk and egg white,
  onion and parsley.  Place 6 small spoonfuls of caviar, 2 of each kind of
  roe, over the garnishes around the plate.
  
       Serve immediately.

      2 tb Oil, olive                               Pepper, black, ground
      3 tb Basil, finely shredded        

-----------------------------SWEET ONION SAUCE-----------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Oil, vegetable                      1 c  Beef, trimmings *
      1 md Onion, sliced                       2 tb Vermouth, dry
      1 c  Veal, trimmings * OR                2 c  Stock, veal **
 
       * Trimmings should be cut into 3/4 inch dice.
       ** See recipe for VEAL STOCK.
  
  For Crepes:
  ===========
  
       Sift the flour into a mixing bowl; add egg, egg yolk and a little
  of the milk and stir to the consistency of smooth paste.  Gradually
  add remaining milk and mix until smooth.  Add salt and pepper, and 1
  tablespoon of parsley and chives.
  
       Heat 2 tablespoons of butter until the butter foams and turns a
  very light brown color.  Whisk this into the batter.  Let the mixture
  stand for at least 2 hours.
  
       Thin the batter with milk, if necessary, to the consistency of
  whipping cream.
  
       Brush a 7" non-stick skillet with a thin film of olive oil and
  place over medium heat.
  
       When hot, add about 3 tablespoons of batter and swirl to coat the
  pan.  Cook until lightly golden, about 1 minute; then flip and cook
  the second side for about 30 seconds.  Continue with remaining batter,
  stacking crepes between sheets of waxed paper.
  
  For Filling:
  ============
  
       In a mixing bowl, mash the cheese with 2 tablespoons of olive oil
  until soft and smooth.  Stir in the basil, 2 tablespoons of parsley,
  olives, and pepper.
  
  For Sweet Onion Sauce:
  ======================
  
       In a heavy saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat,
  then add onion and meat.  Cook uncovered, shaking the pan and stirring
  occasionally, until the meat and the onion are browned (about 20
  minutes.)
  
       Add the vermouth, stirring, to the meat and onions.  Then add the
  stock and bring the mixture to a boil.  Allow the mixture to boil
  gently, skimming the surface often until sauce has reduced to a light
  syrupy consistency (about 30 minutes or longer.)
  
       Remove the saucepan from the heat and swirl in 2 tablespoons of
  butter, bit by bit.  Strain the resulting sauce and season with a
  little bit salt and pepper.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Preheat the oven to 375 F.
  
       Use a narrow spatula or butter knife to spread 1 side of each
  crepe evenly with about 2 tablespoons filling.  Fold each crepe into
  quarters, pressing neatly.
  
       Blanch cucumber slices in boiling salted water for 1 minute then
  drain well.  Arrange the stuffed crepes in a shallow baking pan,
  brushing lightly with olive oil and place them in the oven until
  heated through (about 5 minutes.) Arrange 2 crepes, overlapping
  slightly, on each of 4 heated serving plates.  Arrange 3 cucumber
  slices in a fan pattern next to the crepes and garnish with finely
  slivered olives.
  
       Warm the sauce.  Spoon some sauce around the crepes, and serve.

  cover.  Bring slowly to a boil, skimming off all of the froth that
  forms.
  
       Lower the heat and add tomatoes, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and
  salt.  Simmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours adding water as necessary
  just to cover the ingredients.  Skim whenever necessary.
  
       Add peppercorns for the last 15 minutes of the simmering.
  
       Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through a colander lined with
  a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gently press the solids to
  extract all of the liquid, and discard the solids.
  
       Pour the stock into containers for storage and label and date
  them.
  
       The stock will "keep" for up to 3 days in a refrigerator, and up
  to 6 months in a freezer.

      Title:  Bird's Nests with Cheese
 Categories: Pastries, Masterchefs, Greek, Am
      Yield: 4 servings
 
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten                2 ts Mint, fresh, chopped OR
    1/2 c  Cheese, parmesan, grated          1/2 ts Mint, dried
      2 tb Cheese, ricotta                     1 pn Pepper, black, ground

-----------------------------PASTRY AND GARNISH-----------------------------
      8    Pastry, phyllo, sheets            3/4 c  Cheese, feta, crumbled
    1/2 c  Butter, clarified **                8    Olives, calamata (garnish)
    3/4 c  Cheese, Kasseri, crumbled OR   
 
       ** See "Clarified Butter" recipe.
  
  Filling:
  ========
  
       In mixing bowl, combine eggs, Parmesan, ricotta, mint and pepper.
  Set aside.
  
       Preheat oven to 375 F.
  
       Cut phyllo pastry sheets in half crosswise and cover with waxed
  paper and a lightly dampened kitchen towel.
  
       Place 2 half sheets of phyllo, one on top of the other,
  horizontally on a work surface, trim off and discard a 1 inch strip
  from 1 short edge of sheets.
  
       Pull top sheet toward you so that it overlaps bottom sheet by
  about 1 1/2 inches.  Dot exposed surfaces with clarified butter.
  
       Place a 1/2 inch diameter dowel or no.  11 knitting needle about
  1 1/2 inches from long edge farthest from you.  Fold edge over dowel.
  
       Spread about 1 teaspoon of filling along edge of folded flap.
  
       Fold dowel over filling; then carefully roll up phyllo toward
  you, leaving 1 1/2 inch strip at bottom edge.
  
       Holding edges of the pastry at ends of dowel, gently press them
  toward center, forming pleats as you would on a curtain rod.
  
       (Do not worry if some filling oozes out.)
  
       Firmly holding ends of pastry to maintain pleats, carefully pull
  out dowel.  Bring rolled edges of pastry around, forming a circle; the
  unrolled border will form bottom of each bird's nest.
  
       Transfer bird's nest to ungreased baking sheet.  Brush all
  exposed surfaces of pastry generously with clarified butter.  Bake
  until golden, about 15 minutes.
  
       Remove baking sheet from oven and place about 1 1/2 tablespoons
  of Kasseri in center of each nest.  Return to oven until cheese is
  bubbly.  3 to 4 minutes.
  
       Place an olive in center of each nest.
  
       Serve hot.

 Categories: Dumplings, Chinese, Masterchefs, New york, Au
      Yield: 4 servings
 
-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      2 c  Flour, all purpose                1/2 c  Water or more
      1 pn Salt                          

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 tb Water, cold                       1/2 lb Pork, butt, ground
      1 tb Ginger, fresh, finely             1/4 ts Salt
           -- chopped                          1 pn Pepper, white, ground
      1 tb Scallion, finely, chopped     

-----------------------------SPICY SESAME SAUCE-----------------------------
    1/3 c  Tahini, (sesame seed                1 tb Garlic, finely chopped
           -- paste) + 1 tablespoon            1 tb Oil, chili, hot
    1/3 c  Vinegar, Chinese, rice            1/2 ts Peppercorns, Szechwan,
    1/3 c  Soy sauce                                -- ground
    1/4 c  Sugar                                    Oil, hot chili
  1 1/2 tb Oil, sesame                              Scallions, sliced
 
  For Dough:
  ==========
  
       In a mixer or processor, combine the flour and the salt.
  Gradually add water to the dry ingredients and knead to form a firm
  but moist dough.  Wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or more.
  
  For Filling:
  ============
  
       Combine water with the ginger and scallion.  Let stand, covered,
  2 hours or longer.  Strain, reserving liquid.  Stir liquid into the
  ground pork with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.
  
  For Spicy Sesame Sauce:
  =======================
  
       Use a processor or blender to combine sauce ingredients.  Set
  aside.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Divide your dough into 4 pieces.  Roll each piece into a cylinder
  about 1 inch in diameter.  Pinch or cut 6 or 7 walnut-size pieces from
  each cylinder.  Dust pieces with flour and stand each on a cut side.
  Use a rolling pin to flatten into 2 1/2 to 3-inch circles, turning
  them with your fingers as you roll and making them slightly thicker in
  center than at the edges.
  
       Place rounded teaspoons of meat filing in center of each circle.
  Fold edges up over filling, pressing dough together in center, then on
  two sides.  Pinch firmly.  Place on floured sheet of waxed paper.  (If
  you find that your dumplings aren't sticking together at the edges,
  you can use a little bit of water to wet the edges before you pinch
  them together....  it will act like glue.)
  
       Cook ( a few at a time) in a large pot of boiling water until
  meat is firm, 4 to 5 minutes.  As the dumplings cook, they have a
  tendendy to float - this is normal.  Cook for a full four minutes at a
  minimum, or the meat may not get done.  Drain the dumplings and
  transfer to serving bowls.  Drizzle with spicy sesame sauce and a few
  drops of chili oil.  Sprinkle with scallions and serve.

      Title:  Chicken Stock - Master Chefs
 Categories: Basics, Stocks, Masterchefs, New york
      Yield: 4 quarts
 
      5 lb Chicken, parts, (backs,             2    Garlic, cloves, crushed
           -- necks, carcasses, and            1 bn Parsley, stems
           -- giblets), (no livers)            2    Thyme, sprigs, OR
      2 lg Onions, coarsely chopped            1 pn Thyme, dried
      2 md Carrots, peeled, trimmed            1    Bay leaf

      2 lg Celery, stalks, with leaves,        6    Peppercorns
           -- trimmed, coarsely chopped   
 
       Wash chicken parts well and place them in a large stockpot.
  
       Add cold water to cover by about 2 inches and slowly bring to a
  boil, skimming all of the froth from the surface as it forms.
  
       Lower the heat and add all of the remaining ingredients except
  the peppercorns.  Simmer, uncovered, for 3 hours.  Add water as needed
  to cover the ingredients and skim when necessary.
  
       Add peppercorns for the last fifteen minutes of the simmering
  process.
  
       Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through a colander lined with
  a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gently press the solids to
  extract all of the liquid possible.
  
       Discard the solids and cool the liquid to room temperature.
  
       Refrigerate until chilled and lift off the solid fat that forms
  at the surface.  Discard the fats.
  
       Pour the stock into containers for storage, label and date.
  
       Stock keeps for about 3 days in the refrigerator, and up to six
  months in the freezer.

      Title:  Steamed Salmon with Black Bean Sauce
 Categories: Seafood, Chinese, Masterchefs, New york, Au
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 ea Salmon, fillets, skin                    -- match-stick-thin
           -- removed (about 4 oz              4 ts Scallion, white only,
           -- each)                                 -- shredded
      1 ea Pepper, red bell                    2 tb Soy Sauce
      1 ea Pepper, green bell                  1 tb Chicken Stock **
      2 tb Bamboo shoots, shredded             1 pn Pepper, white, ground
      2 ts Black Beans, fermented              1 ds Oil, vegetable
     12 ea Ginger, slivered,                   1 ds Oil, sesame
 
       ** See recipe for Chicken Stock.
  
       If fillets are thicker than 1/2 to 5/8 inch, carefully cut in
  half horizontally (as you would an English muffin).  Trim each into a
  neat 4-inch square.
  
       Cut off tops and bottoms of peppers to leave a band about 2
  inches wide; remove seeds and ribs.  Cut two 4-inch long rectangular
  pieces from each.  Cut into 1/8-inch julienne, leaving pieces grouped
  in a neat rectangle.  Place salmon on an oiled steamer tray or plate.
  Use a cleaver or knife blade to transfer pepper rectangles to fish,
  completely covering each fillet.
  
       Scatter bamboo shoots over the fish, then sprinkle with black
  beans, ginger and scallions.  In small bowl, stir together soy sauce,
  chicken stock, white pepper, vegetable oil and sesame oil.  Pour
  mixture over.
  
       Steam in covered steamer (making sure that water boils steadily
  but does not boil away) until just cooked through and opaque, 5 to 8
  minutes (timing varies according to thickness of fish).  Carefully
  transfer to serving plate, spoon sauce around and serve immediately.

  For Chicken:
  ============
  
       Hold each chicken portion by the end of a leg and use a kitchen
  towel to grab the skin at the thigh end.  Pull off the skin and
  discard.  With a sharp boning or paring knife, slit the meat on the
  legs and thighs, cutting parallel to the bone.  Scrape the meat away
  from the bone.  Cut through the joint between the leg and the thigh.
  Scrape away all of the remaining meat and cut or pull out the bones.
  Place each boned piece of chicken, skinned side down, on a work
  surface and break up tendons by scoring the meat with a cleaver.  Cut
  the meat into 1 1/2-inch pieces and transfer them to a small bowl.
  
       Sprinkle the chicken with salt, pepper and rice wine.  Stir in
  the beaten egg, sprinkle with cornstarch and toss to combine.  Drizzle
  with oil, toss, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
  
  For Sauce:
  ==========
  
       In a small bowl, stir together a little of the stock and the
  cornstarch.  Add remaining sauce ingredients and set aside.
  
  For Finishing Sauce:
  ====================
  
       Blend together ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
  
  For Spinach:
  ============
  
       In a wok, or a large skillet, heat the oil until nearly smoking.
  Add spinach, stock, garlic and salt and stir-fry until just wilted, 1
  to 1 1/2 minutes.  Arrange in a large ring on a warm serving plate.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       In a second wok, or skillet, heat oil to 360 F (a piece of garlic
  will sizzle steadily when placed in oil).  Add chicken pieces,
  separating them with skimmer,and fry, turning once or twice, until
  lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.
  Raise heat of oil to 400 F and return the chicken to the wok.  Fry
  until golden brown, about 1 minute, then remove and drain.  Pour off
  al but 1 tablespoon of oil.  Add garlic, scallions, and ginger an cook
  for about 30 seconds.  Add sauce, then chicken and toss to coat.  Add
  finishing mixture, tossing to combine.  Arrange chicken on spinach and
  serve immediately.

           -- coarsely chopped                 2    Bay leaf
      1    Leek, trimmed, halved               2    Cloves
           -- lengthwise, coarsely           3/4 ts Salt, coarse
           -- chopped, (white and              8    Peppercorns
           -- green parts)                
 
       Preheat oven to 450 F.
  
       Put the oil in a roasting pan and heat briefly in the oven.
  
       Add the bones to the oil in the pan, toss to coat and roast for
  35 minutes.
  
       Add the onions, carrots, celery, leek, garlic and parsley,
  tossing them all to coat with fat.  Roast 30 minutes longer.
  
       Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the bones and
  vegetables to a clean stockpot.  Drain off as much of the fat as
  possible.
  
       Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat (use 2 burners if
  necessary), and add 2 cups of cold water and boil briefly.  Scrape
  up all of the browned bits into the water.
  
       Transfer the liquid to the stock pot and add enough cold water to
  cover.  Bring slowly to a boil, skimming off all of the froth that
  forms.
  
       Lower the heat and add tomatoes, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and
  salt.  Simmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours adding water as necessary
  just to cover the ingredients.  Skim whenever necessary.
  
       Add peppercorns for the last 15 minutes of the simmering.
  
       Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through a colander lined with
  a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gently press the solids to
  extract all of the liquid, and discard the solids.
  
       Pour the stock into containers for storage and label and date
  them.
  
       The stock will "keep" for up to 3 days in a refrigerator, and up
  to 6 months in a freezer.

       *** Bouquet garni is a bag made of cheesecloth containing leek,
  parsley, thyme, and bay leaf tied inside of it.  It adds flavor and aroma
  to your dish without leaving the solid herbs and spices in the dish
  itself.  After use, the cheesecloth bag is removed and discarded.

       Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.
  
       Add bouquet garni and wine; bring to a boil.

  fork until nearly smooth.  Whisk into wine mixture and boil gently,
  whisking occasionally, until reduced by half.
  
       Add Veal Stock and simmer gently until thickened enough to coat a
  spoon lightly.

  light amber.  The sugar must be cooked carefully to prevent burning;
  break up lumps as you go.  (If there are still lumps of sugar after it
  begins to color, work over low heat, or off heat, until mixture is
  smooth.)
  
       Stir in the orange, the lime and the bag of spices, and cook over
  high heat, stirring constantly for 5 minutes.  Fold in the raisins and
  cranberries, stirring gently to coat with caramelized sugar.  Cook
  over medium heat, stirring gently, until about half of the cranberries
  pop open, about 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and cool.
  
       Remove the bag of spices and spoon the relish into sterilized
  jars.  Cover tightly and refrigerate for 1 month.  This relish keeps
  about 3 months.

      3 tb Butter, unsalted                         -- 1-inch square slices
    3/4 c  Cornmeal                          1/3 c  Raisins, golden
      3 tb Cream, sour                              Nutmeg, fresh, ground
  2 1/2 tb Cheese, Gruyere, grated                  Salt (to taste)
  2 1/2 tb Cheese, Parmesan, grated                 Pepper (to taste)
    1/3 c  Cheese, Gorgonzola,                      Breadcrumbs, fine
 
       In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the milk and butter to a
  boil.  Add the cornmeal in a thin stream, whisking constantly.  When
  mixture becomes very thick, continue to boil while stirring constantly
  with a wooden spoon, until very thick and smooth (about 5 minutes.)
  
       Stir in the sour cream, grated Gruyere, Parmesan, crumbled
  Gorgonzola, raisins, and a little nutmeg, beating until smooth.
  Remove from heat; add salt and pepper to taste.
  
       Spoon the cornmeal mixture into 6 1/2-cup ramekins, or custard
  cups, tapping molds gently on work surface to settle mixture, and
  smoothing tops with spatula.  Cool at least 15 minutes.
  
       Use a knife to loosen polenta from ramekins and unmold onto a
  generously buttered baking dish.  Place a slice of Gorgonzola on top
  of each; sprinkle with a fine layer of breadcrumbs.  Bake in 450 F
  oven (along with quail, if desired) for 10 to 12 minutes, then broil
  just until lightly golden.  Serve immediately.

      Title:  Puff Pastry - Master Chefs
 Categories: Basics, Pastries, Masterchefs, New york, 24fa
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
      4 c  Flour, all purpose                  1 lb Butter, unsalted, chilled,
  1 1/2 ts Salt                                     -- cut into pieces
      1 c  Water, cold                    
 
       This recipe produces a "double batch" for most recipes in the
  database.  Cut all of the ingredients in half if you're only doing one
  recipe.
  
       Set aside about 1/2 cup of flour on a work surface.
  
       Place the remaining flour with the salt in a mixing bowl or
  mixer.
  
       Add 1/4 c (1/2 stick) of the butter and cut the mixture together
  until crumbly.
  
       Add just enough cold water so mixture can be gathered together in
  a ball.
  
       Cut a cross into the top of the ball, and place it in a covered
  bowl and chill for about 30 minutes.
  
       Place the remaining butter on the work surface with the reserved
  flour.  Toss the butter to coat.
  
       Use the heel of your hand to work the flour into the butter then
  place the butter-flour mixture on a sheet of waxed paper, cover with a
  second sheet and press the mixture into a flat square.
  
       Refrigerate just until the butter-flour mixture is approximately
  the same consistency as refrigerated dough.
  
       Roll the dough into a cloverleaf shape, with 4 "leaves" extending
  diagonally from the center.  Place the butter flour mixture in the
  center, then fold each "leaf" over, forming a neat, square package
  with the leaves slightly overlapping.
  
       Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a large
  rectangle with the short end toward you.
  
       Fold into thirds as you would a letter.  Rotate the dough 1/4
  turn so that the open side is at the right (this is called a single
  turn).
  
       Repeat rolling the dough into a large rectangle, folding into
  thirds and rotating 1/4 turn.
  
       Wrap dough and chill 1 hour or longer.
  
       Give the dough 2 more sets of 2 single turns, always beginning
  and ending with the open side at the right.
  
       Refrigerate 1 hour or longer between each set of 2 turns.
  
       After final set of turns (6 single turns in all), wrap and
  refrigerate dough again for at least 1 hour.

      Title:  Quick Puff Pastry - Master Chefs
 Categories: Basics, Pastries, Masterchefs, New york, L
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Flour, instant, or more             1 lb Butter, unsalted, cut into
  1 1/2 ts Salt                                     -- large chunks
 
  3/4 c  Water, cold (about)
  
  For Quick Puff Pastry:
  ======================
  
       In a mixing bowl or mixer, roughly combine the flour, salt and
  butter, breaking up the butter slightly (there should be visible
  chunks).  Gradually add just enough cold water to hold the dough
  together.  DO NOT OVERWORK.
  
       Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll it
  into a rectangular shape about 9 by 12 inches.  Dust the board, dough,
  and rolling pin with flour as often as necessary to prevent sticking.
  Starting with the closest short end, fold the dough into thirds as you
  would a letter.  Rotate the dough so the open side is at your right.
  Repeat, rolling the dough into a rectangle, folding it into thirds and
  rotating is as before.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for
  at least 1 hour.
  
       Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface with the open
  side at your right.  Roll the dough into a rectangle as before.  Now
  bring the two short ends together to meet in the center of the dough,
  then fold the dough in half again toward you.  Rotate a 1/4 turn, so
  the open side is again at your right.  Repeat, rolling the dough into
  a rectangle, folding in half, then in half again, and rotating a 1/4
  turn.  Wrap the dough and chill again for at least 1 hour.

  For Sweet Onion Sauce:
  ======================
  
       In a heavy saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat,
  then add onion and meat.  Cook uncovered, shaking the pan and stirring
  occasionally, until the meat and the onion are browned (about 20
  minutes.)
  
       Add the vermouth, stirring, to the meat and onions.  Then add the
  stock and bring the mixture to a boil.  Allow the mixture to boil
  gently, skimming the surface often until sauce has reduced to a light
  syrupy consistency (about 30 minutes or longer.)
  
       Remove the saucepan from the heat and swirl in 2 tablespoons of
  butter, bit by bit.  Strain the resulting sauce and season with a
  little bit salt and pepper.
  
  
       Warm the sauce.  Spoon some sauce around the crepes, and serve.

       ** If you have previously prepared Veal Stock - the simplest thing to
  do is to take a 1/2 cup of the veal stock and boil it until it reduces to
  about 2 tablespoons and takes on the consistency of thick syrup.  If you
  don't have Veal Stock handy, then you follow this recipe to make the stock
  first.
  
       Preheat oven to 450 F.
  
       Put the oil in a roasting pan and heat briefly in the oven.
  
       Add the bones to the oil in the pan, toss to coat and roast for
  35 minutes.
  
       Add the onions, carrots, celery, leek, garlic and parsley,
  tossing them all to coat with fat.  Roast 30 minutes longer.
  
       Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the bones and
  vegetables to a clean stockpot.  Drain off as much of the fat as
  possible.
  
       Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat (use 2 burners if
  neces-) (sary), and add 2 cups of cold water and boil briefly.  Scrape
  up all of the browned bits into the water.
  
       Transfer the liquid to the stock pot and add enough cold water to
  cover.  Bring slowly to a boil, skimming off all of the froth that
  forms.
  
       Lower the heat and add tomatoes, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and
  salt.  Simmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours adding water as necessary
  just to cover the ingredients.  Skim whenever necessary.
  
       Add peppercorns for the last 15 minutes of the simmering.
  
       Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through a colander lined with
  a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gently press the solids to
  extract all of the liquid, and discard the solids.
  
       Pour the stock into containers for storage and label and date
  them.
  
       The stock will "keep" for up to 3 days in a refrigerator, and up
  to 6 months in a freezer.
  
       This stock is now used to make the Glaze as noted in the beginning of
  these directions.

      3 ea Cepes, fresh, sliced                     Pepper (to taste)
     24 ea Snails, (1 - 7 1/2 oz

      4 lg Mushrooms, stems trimmed            2 tb Water
           -- flush with caps, caps            1 tb Juice, lemon
           -- fluted                           1 tb Butter
 
       * Other wild or cultivated mushrooms may be substituted
      ** See recipes for Puff Pastry, Bordelaise Sauce, and Veal Stock.
  
  For Feuilletes:
  ===============
  
       Roll out your puff pastry to large rectangle, 1/8-inch thick.  Use
  a 5-inch oval or 4-inch round cutter to cut out 4 pieces of pastry.
  Place them on a baking sheet.  Stir together the egg yolk and water and
  lightly brush the pastry with this egg wash.  Chill pastry for 30
  minutes.
  
       Preheat oven to 400 F.  Bake feuilletes for 20 minutes, then lower
  the temperature to 350 F and continue to bake until they've turned
  golden brown (about 5 to 10 minutes longer.)  Cool them on a rack.
  
       In a saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat
  and add the shallot, stirring until wilted (about 2 minutes.) Add the
  chanterelles and cepes and stir until quite dry (6 to 8 minutes.) Add
  snails and toss well.
  
       Add 3 tablespoons of Cognac, light the alcohol carefully with a
  long handled match, and cook 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer this mixture to
  a sieve placed over a bowl and return the pan to heat.  Add red wine and
  reduce by half, scraping up any browned bits in the pan (about 4
  minutes.)
  
       Add Bordelaise sauce, or veal stock and reduce until thickened
  enough to coat a spoon lightly, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the
  heat, swirl in the remaining butter a little at a time, and adjust
  seasonings to taste with salt and pepper and a few drops of Cognac.
  
  For Garnish:
  ============
  
       Slice the tops off of the feuilletes and scoop out insides.  Return
  feuillettes and their lids to the oven briefly to reheat.  In a small
  saucepan, combine the mushrooms, water, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of
  butter.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; cover and cook, shaking
  the pan occasionally, until just tender (about 4 minutes.) Remove the
  mushrooms; drain them and cut them into thick slices.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Add the snail-mushroom mixture to your sauce and bring it all to a
  simmer.  Place heated pastry shells on 4 heated plates and fill with
  snail mixture.  Garnish with mushroom slices by overlapping them along 1
  edge of each shell.  Spoon any remaining sauce over, replace lids at a
  slight angle, and serve immediately.

      Title:  Puff Pastry - Master Chefs
 Categories: Basics, Pastries, Masterchefs, New york, 24fa
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
      4 c  Flour, all purpose                  1 lb Butter, unsalted, chilled,
  1 1/2 ts Salt                                     -- cut into pieces
      1 c  Water, cold                    
 
       This recipe produces a "double batch" for most recipes in the
  database.  Cut all of the ingredients in half if you're only doing one
  recipe.
  
       Set aside about 1/2 cup of flour on a work surface.
  
       Place the remaining flour with the salt in a mixing bowl or
  mixer.
  
       Add 1/4 c (1/2 stick) of the butter and cut the mixture together
  until crumbly.
  
       Add just enough cold water so mixture can be gathered together in
  a ball.
  
       Cut a cross into the top of the ball, and place it in a covered
  bowl and chill for about 30 minutes.
  
       Place the remaining butter on the work surface with the reserved
  flour.  Toss the butter to coat.
  
       Use the heel of your hand to work the flour into the butter then
  place the butter-flour mixture on a sheet of waxed paper, cover with a
  second sheet and press the mixture into a flat square.
  
       Refrigerate just until the butter-flour mixture is approximately
  the same consistency as refrigerated dough.
  
       Roll the dough into a cloverleaf shape, with 4 "leaves" extending
  diagonally from the center.  Place the butter flour mixture in the
  center, then fold each "leaf" over, forming a neat, square package
  with the leaves slightly overlapping.
  
       Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a large
  rectangle with the short end toward you.
  
       Fold into thirds as you would a letter.  Rotate the dough 1/4
  turn so that the open side is at the right (this is called a single
  turn).
  
       Repeat rolling the dough into a large rectangle, folding into
  thirds and rotating 1/4 turn.
  
       Wrap dough and chill 1 hour or longer.
  
       Give the dough 2 more sets of 2 single turns, always beginning
  and ending with the open side at the right.
  
       Refrigerate 1 hour or longer between each set of 2 turns.
  
       After final set of turns (6 single turns in all), wrap and
  refrigerate dough again for at least 1 hour.

      1    Bouquet garni ***                   3 c  Veal Stock **
 
       ** Recipe for this ingredient can be found elsewhere in database.
  
       *** Bouquet garni is a bag made of cheesecloth containing leek,
  parsley, thyme, and bay leaf tied inside of it.  It adds flavor and aroma
  to your dish without leaving the solid herbs and spices in the dish
  itself.  After use, the cheesecloth bag is removed and discarded.
  
       Heat butter in medium saucepan.
  
       Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.
  
       Add bouquet garni and wine; bring to a boil.
  
       Meanwhile, in mixing bowl, mash together marrow and flour with
  fork until nearly smooth.  Whisk into wine mixture and boil gently,
  whisking occasionally, until reduced by half.
  
       Add Veal Stock and simmer gently until thickened enough to coat a
  spoon lightly.

      2 tb Thyme, fresh, chopped OR            2 c  Stock, lamb **  OR
  1 1/2 ts Thyme, dried                        2 c  Stock, veal **
      1 tb Oil, vegetable                           Watercress, sprigs
      1 md Onion, coarsely chopped                  -- (garnish)
      1 ea Carrot, coarsely chopped                 --
      1 ea Celery, stalk, coarsely                  --
           -- chopped                               --
 
     ** See recipes for Lamb Stock and Veal Stock. 
  
       Preheat the oven to 450 F. Trim the lamb, leaving about 1/4 inch
  of fat, and score the fat in a crisscross pattern.  Wrap any exposed
  bone ends with aluminum foil.  Season both sides with salt and pepper
  and rub in half of the thyme.
  
       Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over
  medium-high heat.  Add lamb, fat side down.  Saute, shaking pan
  occasionally to avoid the meat from sticking, until lightly golden
  (about 2 minutes.) Turn the lamb and lightly brown the other side.
  Turn again, fat side down.
  
       Place the skillet in the oven and lower heat to 400 F. Roast for
  10 minutes.  Remove the racks and set aside.  Pour off any excess fat.
  
       Add the onion, carrot, celery and remaining thyme and rosemary to
  the skillet and return racks to the pan fat side up.  Roast 12 to 15
  minutes longer for medium rare, then transfer racks to a work surface
  and place the skillet over medium-high heat.
  
       Add white wine to the skillet and reduce slightly, scraping up any
  browned bits in the pan.  Add the stock and cook until very lightly
  thickened (about 15 minutes.) Carve lamb into individual chops and
  arrange on heated serving plates.  Strain stock mixture; degrease and
  season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour the sauce over the lamb and
  garnish with watercress sprigs.  Serve immediately.

---------------------------ALMOND MERINGUE LAYERS---------------------------
      6 lg Egg whites, at room temp.       2 1/2 c  Sugar, powdered, sifted,
    3/4 c  Almonds, blanched, ground                -- plus more as needed
  2 1/2 tb Sugar                         

------------------------HAZELNUT PRALINE BUTTERCREAM------------------------
      1 c  Milk                                1 tb Sugar
      4 lg Egg yolks                           4 oz Hazelnut Praline Paste *
    1/3 c  Sugar, plus                     1 1/2 c  Almonds, toasted, sliced
      1 c  Butter, unsalted, at                     -- (about 4 ounces) **
           -- room temperature            
 
  * Available at specialty stores or by mail order from H. Roth and Sons,
     1577 First Avenue, New York, New York, 10028, (212)-734-1110
  
  ** Simply toast almonds at 350 F for 7 to 10 minutes.
  
  For Almond Meringue:
  ====================
  
       Preheat the oven to 325 F. Cut out three 10-inch parchment paper
  circles and one 10-inch cardboard circle.  Set the parchment circles on
  baking sheets.
  
       Beat egg whites to soft peaks and gradually add 2 1/2 tablespoons
  of sugar and continue beating until stiff.  Combine 2 1/2 cups of
  powdered sugar and ground almonds; fold into egg whites.
  
       Spoon mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a no.  6 round tip.  (A
  number six tip leaves a round, tube-like stream a little less than a
  half inch in diameter.) Pipe meringue onto parchment circles, starting
  in the center and spiraling outward just to the edge.  Dust lightly with
  powdered sugar.  Bake the circles until crisp and very lightly golden
  (25 to 30 minutes.)  Cool on racks.
  
  For Buttercream:
  ================
  
       Place a medium bowl in a larger bowl of ice water.  Set Aside.
  
       Bring milk to the boiling point in a heavy saucepan over medium
  heat.
  
       Meanwhile, beat egg yolks in a large mixer bowl until smooth.
  Gradually add 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon of sugar and continue berating
  until the mixture is pale yellow and forms a ribbon when beaters are
  lifted (about 7 minutes.)
  
       Gradually add boiling milk to yolk mixture, beating constantly to
  avoid the yolk curdling.  Return the mixture to the saucepan, and cook
  over low heat - stirring with a wooden spoon, for 30 seconds.
  Immediately pour custard into the bowl set over ice water.
  
       Cool, stirring occasionally.
  
       Beat the butter and praline paste in a large bowl until smooth and
  creamy.  Gradually beat in cooled custard.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Using cardboard as a guide, trim meringues to even circles.
  Carefully peel off the parchment paper.  Choose 1 meringue with a smooth
  bottom and set aside.
  
       Spread 1/3 of the cream onto 1 meringue layer.  Top with a second
  meringue, centering it over the bottom layer.  Smooth on another layer
  of buttercream.  Top with remaining meringue, smooth side up, pressing
  gently.  Frost sides and top of cake with remaining buttercream.  Gently
  press sliced almonds onto sides and top with a spatula.
  
       Dust about 2 inches of rim and 2-inch circle in center with
  powdered sugar.  Transfer to serving platter.  Let stand at room
  temperature for 30 minutes before serving in wedges.

 Categories: Pasta, Italian, Masterchefs, New york, Cd
      Yield: 6 servings
 
-----------------------------------PASTA-----------------------------------
      3 c  Flour, all purpose              1 1/2 ts Oil, olive
      3 lg Eggs, lightly beaten                2 tb Water (about)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 md Squash, acorn (about              1/4 c  Ham, chopped
           -- 1 3/4 pounds)                  1/4 c  Cheese, ricotta
      1 c  Escarole, leaves                    1 lg Egg
  1 1/2 tb Butter                                   Pepper, black, ground
    1/3 c  Cheese, Parmesan, grated            1 pn Nutmeg, grated
      1 tb Parsley, chopped                         Salt (to taste)

-----------------------------TOMATO-CREAM SAUCE-----------------------------
    1/4 c  Butter, unsalted                  1/4 c  Sauce, tomato
      1 c  Cream, whipping                          Cheese, Parmesan, grated
    1/3 c  Cheese, pecorino               
 
  For Pasta:
  ==========
  
       In a mixer with a dough hook, or a processor, combine the flour,
  eggs and oil, adding water as needed to form a soft ball.  Transfer to
  a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 5 minutes.  Cover
  with a damp cloth and set aside for 30 minutes.
  
  For Filling:
  ============
  
       Halve the squash and remove all of its seeds and strings.  Cut
  the squash up into large wedges and cook, covered, in boiling salted
  water until tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain completely and cool
  briefly.  Scoop out the flesh.  (You should have about 2 cups.)
  
       Place the escarole in a saucepan with about 1 cup of water;
  cover.  Steam the escarole, tossing once or twice, just until wilted,
  3 to 5 minutes.  Drain in a colander, rinse with cold water, squeeze
  dry and chop coarsely.  Set aside.
  
       Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over
  medium-high heat.  Add squash and cook, stirring, until dry, about 5
  minutes, breaking up the flesh coarsely as it cooks.  Add Parmesan
  cheese and parsley, lower heat to medium and stir for 3 minutes.
  
       Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and stir in the escarole,
  ham, ricotta and egg.  Season with black pepper, nutmeg and a little
  salt, if desired.  Set aside.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Cut the dough into 3 pieces.  Roll each piece with a heavy
  rolling pin on a lightly floured board (or use a pasta machine) until
  it's 1/8-inch thick.  (You should be able to see your fingers through
  the dough.)
  
       Use a 4-inch cutter to cut out rounds of dough; place them on a
  lightly floured baking sheet.  Place about 1 1/2 teaspoons squash
  filling on lower half of each round, leaving a border.  Fold top half
  of each round over filling and press edges together to seal.  Warp
  edges of each half-circle around your index finger, bringing ends
  together to overlap by about 1/4 inch.  Pinch edges to seal.
  
  For Sauce:
  ==========
  
       Melt 1/4 cup of butter in a heavy saucepan.  Add cream and a
  generous amount of white pepper, whisking over medium-high heat.  Stir
  in the pecorino cheese (in a pinch, you could probably get away with
  Parmesan, but it won't taste the same) and tomato sauce.  Boil gently
  3 to 4 minutes.
  
       Meanwhile, cook tortelloni in a large pot of boiling salted water
  until they float to the surface, then boil 1 minute longer; drain.
  Place the tortelloni in heated serving bowls, nap with sauce and serve
  immediately, with additional Parmesan and white pepper.

      8 oz Pancetta (Italian bacon)            6 tb Butter, unsalted
           -- (unsmoked) OR                    3 md Garlic, cloves, peeled
      8 oz Bacon                                    Salt
      2 tb Parsley, chopped                  1/2 c  Wine, white, dry
      2 ea Bay leaves                        1/2 c  Vermouth
           Nutmeg, grated                    1/3 c  Almonds, coarsely ground
           Pepper, coarsely ground        
 
       Make a deep incision down the center of the veal, being careful
  not to cut all the way through; gently open it out flat as you would a
  book.  Trim off and reserve any irregular pieces of meat along the
  edges, leaving a neat, compact shape.
  
       Place rosemary along the center of the meat.  Top the meat with
  half of the pancetta, overlapping the slices.  Sprinkle with parsley
  and top with remaining pancetta, bay leaves, nutmeg and pepper.
  
       Drain the porcini mushrooms, reserving and straining the liquid.
  Rinse the porcini in cool water, drain again, chop coarsely and place
  on the top of the meat.
  
       Top with any reserved meat trimmings.  Close up meat compactly
  and tie with kitchen twine, going once around lengthwise and several
  times around crosswise.  Pat dry.
  
       Melt the butter in a deep casserole over medium heat.  Add garlic
  and cook until golden, about 6 minutes, then discard the garlic.  Add
  the stuffed roast, season with salt, and cook until lightly golden on
  all sides, 15 to 20 minutes.
  
       Add wine and vermouth, basting the meat.  Cover the casserole,
  lower heat to medium low and cook, turning and basting occasionally,
  for 15 minutes.
  
       Stir in the almonds and 1/2 cup of reserved mushroom-soaking

      Title:  Cima alla Genovese Info
 Categories: Roasts, Veal, Masterchefs, New york, F
      Yield: 12 servings
 
 
       Because Cima alla Genovese has so many ingredients and direction
  lines, I've had to split it up into three different recipes for import.
  This is one of my favorite recipes for impressing guests because it is
  relatively easy, yet it looks so tempting difficult to do.
  
       Please be sure to collect all three recipes before you begin
  cooking or you'll be sorely disappointed.... <smiling>:

           -- Salsa Verde **                        --

------------------------------------VEAL------------------------------------
      6 lb Veal, breast, trimmed,              5 lg Eggs, hard cooked, peeled
           -- boned, butterflied         

------------------------------POACHING LIQUID------------------------------
    1/4 c  Salt, coarse (about)                1 lg Carrot, sliced
      1 md Onion, sliced                       3 ea Bay leaves
 
       ** See other recipes for Cima alla Genovese Stuffing and Cima
  alla Genovese Salsa Verde.
  
       Spread half of the cooled stuffing down the length of the veal
  breast, leaving a 2 1/2 inch border on the long sides.  Press the
  stuffing together compactly.  Lay 5 hard cooked eggs end to end down
  the length of the stuffing.  Spoon the remaining stuffing over eggs,
  pressing it compactly with your hands into a high, narrow shape.  When
  the meat is rolled later, the eggs should be in approximately the
  center of the roll.
  
       Pull a needle with twine through a hole in the center of one
  short end of the veal.  Gather together the 2 corners of this short
  end and sew the end together, stitching from the inside outward at 1
  inch intervals.  Now stitch together both long sides of the veal
  breast, gathering them together and pushing the stuffing in as you
  stitch at 1 inch intervals.  Sew together other short end, tying a
  knot as you sew it shut.  Cut off the string, leaving about 4 inches
  at the end.
  
       Lay a large sheet of cheesecloth (about 2 x 3 feet) next to
  stuffed veal breast.  Without picking up breast, flip it over
  carefully onto the center of the cheesecloth.  Fold one long side of
  cheesecloth over the length of the breast, wrapping it firmly, but not
  tightly.  Then fold the short ends up, and finally the second long side.
  
       Wrap some twine around the length of the breast 3 or 4 times,
  then bring the twine around the breast crosswise in a spiral at 1 1/2
  inch intervals.  Tie the twine at one end of the breast.
  
  To Poach:
  =========
  
       Choose a deep pot large enough to hold the veal and half fill it
  with cold water.  Add about 1/4 cup coarse salt, sliced onion, sliced
  carrot, and bay leaves.  Bring to a boil.  Lower heat, and add veal.
  If necessary, add additional water to cover.  Place a lid on the veal
  breast to keep it submerged.  Simmer 1 hour and 45 minutes.
  
       When veal is cooked, transfer it to a roasting pan.  Cover with
  second pan and weight it down to compact the roll.  Cool to lukewarm
  or room temperature, 2 to 3 hours.
  
       When veal is cool, remove outer twine and cheesecloth.  Cut off
  the one knotted end of twine, and starting at other end, very
  carefully pull out stitching and discard.  Trim off excess fat,
  without cutting into the filling.
  
       Cut into thick slices and serve with salsa verde.  (Unused
  portions may be refrigerated and served cold.)

       Because the number of ingredients and directions lines exceeds
  the limits of the Meal Master program, I've taken the liberty of
  splitting up this recipe into three parts.  Please capture all three
  parts before attempting to cook this recipe or you'll find yourself in
  a quandary at some point!  ;-) :

      Title:  Pappardelle I (Pasta)
 Categories: Pasta, Masterchefs, New york, F
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Flour, all purpose                  1 ts Oil, olive
      2 lg Eggs                              3/4 c  Water, warm (approximately)
    1/4 ts Salt                           
 
  For Pasta:
  ==========
  
       Place 3 cups of flour on your work surface.  Make a well in the
  center of the flour.
  
       Beat the eggs together with the salt and pour into the flour
  well.
  
       Stirring the eggs with your fingertips, gradually incorporate the
  flour.  When about half of the flour has been incorporated, drizzle 1
  teaspoon of olive oil over the egg-flour mixture and stir it in.
  
       Use a little of the remaining 1/2 cup of flour to rub any sticky
  bits from your fingers.  Continue to add the unincorporated flour
  alternately with warm water, until you have worked in all of the flour
  and just enough water to form a mass that is supple but not sticky.
  
       Knead the mixture until very smooth and silky (about 10 minutes)
  adding flour if it becomes sticky, or a little warm water if it becomes
  too firm. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.
  
       Go on to the next recipe and prepare the Duck in sauce.

  pappardelle strips about 1 x 5 inches.  Repeat with remaining 2 pieces
  of dough.
  
       Place pappardelle on tray lined with floured cloth and let dry
  briefly, uncovered, in refrigerator.
  
       Meanwhile, bring 5 quarts water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon of
  salt.
  
       Add pasta gradually, stirring with wooden spoon.  Boil
  vigorously, uncovered, until just tender, 2 to 4 minutes.  Drain well.
  
       Immediately return the pasta to the empty pot with half of the
  sauce and 1/4 cup Parmesan, tossing gently over medium heat.
  
       Serve immediately on heated plates, topping with remaining sauce.
  Additional Parmesan and a pepper mill should be made available at the
  table.

 Categories: Soups, Masterchefs, New york, L
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 ea Pumpkin, ripe, 8 to 10              6 c  Stock, chicken **
           -- inches in diameter                    Salt (to taste)
      8 tb Butter, unsalted                         Pepper, white (to taste)
      1 md Onion, chopped                      1 ea Bread, French, 10" long,
    2/3 c  Wine, white, dry                         -- thinly sliced OR
      2 sm Turnips, white, peeled              2 ea Bread, rolls, with crust
           -- and sliced                            -- thinly sliced
      1 ea Carrot, peeled, sliced            1/2 c  Cream, whipping

       ** See recipe for Chicken Stock.
 
       Cut off and reserve the top of the pumpkin.  Use a large spoon or
  melon baller to scoop out and discard all of the seeds and strings.
  Scrape out the pumpkin flesh without breaking through the shell.  You
  should have about 6 cups of pumpkin pieces.  Set aside the hollow
  pumpkin and lid.
  
       In a large casserole, heat 2 tablespoons of butter over medium
  heat.  Add the onion and saute, stirring often, until softened and
  very lightly golden, about 6 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer for 1
  minute longer.  Add the turnips, carrot, reserved pumpkin flesh, and
  enough Chicken Stock to cover solids.  Season lightly with salt and
  pepper.  Cover and bring to a boil.
  
       Meanwhile, cut the bread slices into thin wedges about 1/2-inch
  long.  In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of butter over medium
  heat.  Add half of the bread pieces and toss constantly in butter
  until lightly golden, about 5 minutes.  Add these croutons to the
  soup.  Saute the remaining uncooked croutons in the remaining butter,
  set aside for garnish.
  
       Boil soup gently, covered, for 1 hour.  Puree mixture in a
  processor or blender until smooth.  Return the pureed soup to a clean
  saucepan, stir in the cream, and bring to a simmer.  Thin, if
  necessary, with additional stock.  Adjust seasoning with salt and
  pepper.  Serve soup in pumpkin, passing remaining croutons separately.

      Title:  Sole a la Catalane
 Categories: Seafood, Masterchefs, New york, L
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 md Tomatoes, rips                      2 ea Sole, fillets, (about 6
     14 tb Butter, unsalted, cut into               -- ounces each), split
           -- pieces, plus more as                  -- lengthwise
           -- needed                         1/2 c  Wine, white, dry
      4 sm Onion, white, thinly                1 tb Parsley, chopped
           -- sliced                           1 tb Chives, fresh, chopped
      2 tb Shallot, finely chopped        
 
       Preheat the oven to 300 F. Carefully cut the out core of each
  tomato, removing a small, narrow plug and leaving the tomato intact.
  Blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for a few seconds; drain under
  cold water and slip off their skins.  Cut a lid from the smooth bottom
  of each tomato (opposite the core) and set aside.  With a melon scoop
  or spoon, carefully hollow out the pulp and seeds from the tomatoes,
  leaving a neat shell.  Place the tomatoes and their lids in a small
  buttered baking dish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, set aside.
  
       In a small skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of butter and saute the
  sliced onions over medium heat until softened but not browned, 5 to 7
  minutes.  Spoon cooked onions into the hollowed tomatoes, dividing
  evenly.
  
       On a work surface, gently flatten the sole fillets, tapping them
  with the side of a wide knife blade.  Carefully roll up each fillet,
  beginning with the small (tail) end and with the smooth, shiny skinned
  surface on the inside.  Lightly butter a heat-proof shallow baking dish
  in which the fillets will fit compactly.  Scatter shallot into the
  dish, then arrange rolled fish fillets over shallot.  Salt and pepper
  the fish lightly and pour wine over all.  Cover the dish with buttered
  parchment or waxed paper, buttered side down.  Place the pan over
  medium heat and bring almost to a boil.  Place the pan of fish and the
  pan of tomatoes in the oven.  Bake until fillets are just cooked
  through, 6 to 8 minutes.
  
       DO NOT OVERCOOK.
  
       Remove the pans from the oven.  With a slotted spatula, lift each
  fillet, draining all of the liquid back into the pan, and place each
  fillet upright in a tomato.  Place the pan of fish-cooking liquid over
  high heat and boil the liquid until it's reduced to a few tablespoons
  of syrupy liquid.  Reduce the heat to very low.  Whisk in the
  remaining 12 tablespoons of butter, 1 or 2 pieces at a time, adding
  more only when the previous addition has become creamy and smooth.
  Strain this sauce into a small bowl, stir in the parsley and chives
  and season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
       Place each stuffed tomato on a warm serving plate.  Spoon some of
  the sauce over each fillet and around each tomato.  Gently replace the
  lids and serve immediately.

      Title:  Medaillons de Veau en Croute
 Categories: Veal, Pastry, Masterchefs, New york, L
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  Quick Puff Pastry **                     --
      1 x  Duxelles Stuffing **                     --

-------------------------------VEAL AND SAUCE-------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Veal, loin, boneless, lean          2 c  Veal Stock **
           Salt (to taste)                     1 ea Egg yolk, beaten with 1
           Pepper, white (to taste)                 -- teaspoon of cold water
      2 tb Butter, unsalted                         Watercress, sprigs
      3 tb Shallot, chopped                         -- (garnish)
    1/2 c  Wine, white, dry               
 
       ** See recipes for Puff Pastry, Veal Stock and Duxelles Stuffing.
  
  For Veal and Sauce:
  ===================
  
       Cut the loin of veal into 6 slices 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick.
  Flatten the slices slightly with a cleaver or knife blade.  Pat the
  slices dry and sprinkle with salt and white pepper.  Dredge the slices
  in all purpose flour, shaking off any excess to leave a very light
  coating.  In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of butter over high
  heat.  Add the meat (work in batches if necessary) and saute until
  golden, shaking the pan occasionally and turning the slices once,
  about 2 minutes.  Lower the heat to low, cover the pan and cook for 2
  minutes.  Transfer the meat to a platter and pour off all but 1
  tablespoon of butter from the skillet.  Add shallots, raise the heat,
  and stir for 1 minute.  Add the wine, scraping up any browned bits in
  the pan, and boil until reduced by half.  Add Veal Stock and any
  juices from the veal and boil until reduced by about 1/3.  Strain the
  sauce and set it aside.  Chill meat, covered.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       On a lightly floured work surface, roll out about 1/3 of the
  puff pastry into a rectangle, 1/16-inch thick.  Cut 6 pastry ovals
  roughly the shape of veal medallions but somewhat larger, to leave a
  generous border.  Roll out remaining pastry to large rectangle about
  1/8 inch thick.  Cut out 6 slightly larger pastry ovals, reserving
  trimmings for another use.
  
       Place the thinner set of pastry ovals on a large ungreased baking
  sheet.  Brush the pastry lightly with egg yolk mixture, then place
  chilled veal medallion in the center of each oval.  Spread a layer of
  cooled duxelles stuffing on each, mounding it slightly and dividing it
  evenly.  Top each medallion with one of the thicker pastry ovals,
  smoothing it gently without stretching.  Press edges of the pastry
  together firmly to seal.  Brush pastry with egg wash.  With a large
  round cutter or knife, trim off the edges of the pastry, leaving a 1/2
  inch border.  Use a small knife to trace a leaf pattern in the top of
  each pastry; score a few lines along the sides.  Place the baking
  sheet in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or longer.
  
       Preheat the oven to 425 F. Bake veal en croute on the center rack
  until golden brown, about 14 minutes.  Meanwhile, reheat sauce,
  reducing it further if necessary until it coats a spoon lightly.
  Serve veal surrounded with some of the sauce and garnished with
  watercress sprigs; serve remaining sauce separately.

      Title:  Duxelles Stuffing - Master Chefs
 Categories: Basics, Masterchefs, New york, L
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 sm Brains, calf, (12 ounces)       2 1/2 c  Mushrooms, thinly sliced
    1/4 c  Vinegar, wine, white (opt)               Pepper, ground (to taste)
      1 ea Bay leaf                            2 tb Shallot, chopped
      2 tb Butter, unsalted                    2 tb Parsley, chopped
 
  For Duxelles Stuffing:
  ======================
  
       Soak the calf brains in a bowl of cold water with 2 tablespoons
  of vinegar about 30 minutes.  Drain and carefully remove as much of
  the membrane and veins as possible from the brains.  Set aside.  In a
  small saucepan, combine 3 cups of cold water, the remaining 2
  tablespoons of vinegar, a little salt and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil,
  and simmer for 10 minutes.  Gently add the brains and immediately
  remove the pan from the heat.  Let the brains sit in the liquid,
  covered, for 8 minutes, then transfer them with a slotted spatula to a
  small bowl.  Set aside.
  
       Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-high
  heat.  Add mushrooms, sprinkle with salt and black pepper, and stir
  until nearly dry, about 8 minutes.  Add the shallot and cook for 2
  minutes longer.  Add cooked brains, and stir, breaking up the brains,
  until mixture is almost pureed.  Add 1/4 cup of reserved Veal Stock
  to the mixture and simmer briefly until thick.  Remove from the heat,
  stir in parsley and adjust seasoning.  Cool mixture completely, then
  chill, covered.

      Title:  Puff Pastry - Master Chefs
 Categories: Basics, Pastries, Masterchefs, New york, 24fa
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
      4 c  Flour, all purpose                  1 lb Butter, unsalted, chilled,
  1 1/2 ts Salt                                     -- cut into pieces
      1 c  Water, cold                    
 
       This recipe produces a "double batch" for most recipes in the
  database.  Cut all of the ingredients in half if you're only doing one
  recipe.
  
       Set aside about 1/2 cup of flour on a work surface.
  
       Place the remaining flour with the salt in a mixing bowl or
  mixer.
  
       Add 1/4 c (1/2 stick) of the butter and cut the mixture together
  until crumbly.
  
       Add just enough cold water so mixture can be gathered together in
  a ball.
  
       Cut a cross into the top of the ball, and place it in a covered
  bowl and chill for about 30 minutes.
  
       Place the remaining butter on the work surface with the reserved
  flour.  Toss the butter to coat.
  
       Use the heel of your hand to work the flour into the butter then
  place the butter-flour mixture on a sheet of waxed paper, cover with a
  second sheet and press the mixture into a flat square.
  
       Refrigerate just until the butter-flour mixture is approximately
  the same consistency as refrigerated dough.
  
       Roll the dough into a cloverleaf shape, with 4 "leaves" extending
  diagonally from the center.  Place the butter flour mixture in the
  center, then fold each "leaf" over, forming a neat, square package
  with the leaves slightly overlapping.
  
       Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a large
  rectangle with the short end toward you.
  
       Fold into thirds as you would a letter.  Rotate the dough 1/4
  turn so that the open side is at the right (this is called a single
  turn).
  
       Repeat rolling the dough into a large rectangle, folding into
  thirds and rotating 1/4 turn.
  
       Wrap dough and chill 1 hour or longer.
  
       Give the dough 2 more sets of 2 single turns, always beginning
  and ending with the open side at the right.
  
       Refrigerate 1 hour or longer between each set of 2 turns.
  
       After final set of turns (6 single turns in all), wrap and
  refrigerate dough again for at least 1 hour.

  possible.
  
       Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat (use 2 burners if
  neces-) (sary), and add 2 cups of cold water and boil briefly.  Scrape
  up all of the browned bits into the water.
  
       Transfer the liquid to the stock pot and add enough cold water to
  cover.  Bring slowly to a boil, skimming off all of the froth that
  forms.
  
       Lower the heat and add tomatoes, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and
  salt.  Simmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours adding water as necessary
  just to cover the ingredients.  Skim whenever necessary.
  
       Add peppercorns for the last 15 minutes of the simmering.
  
       Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through a colander lined with
  a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gently press the solids to
  extract all of the liquid, and discard the solids.
  
       Pour the stock into containers for storage and label and date
  them.
  
       The stock will "keep" for up to 3 days in a refrigerator, and up
  to 6 months in a freezer.

  parchment or waxed paper in half lengthwise and lightly oil one side
  of paper and wrap it around souffle dish so it extends 3 inches above
  top of dish, taping it securely with masking tape.
  
       Preheat the oven to 200 F. Beat 2 egg whites until they form
  stiff peaks.  Stir together ground almonds and sugar and gently fold
  into beaten egg whites.  Transfer mixture to pastry bag fitted with
  round 1/2-inch tip.  Starting in the center and spiraling outward,
  form 2 8-inch circles 1/4 inch thick.  Bake until crisp, about 1 1/2
  hours.  Cool on a rack.
  
  For Mousse:
  ===========
  
       Choose a few perfect raspberries for garnish and set aside.
  Puree remaining raspberries in processor or blender until very smooth.
  Transfer 2 tablespoons of puree, with seeds, to measuring cup.  Strain
  remaining puree into mixing bowl, eliminating all seeds.  Add enough
  strained puree to the 2 tablespoons to measure 1/2 cup.  Set aside.
  Chill remaining strained puree, which will be used as sauce.
  
       In a small heavy saucepan combine sugar, water, and corn syrup.
  Bring slowly to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally and
  brushing down any sugar crystals from sides of pan with brush dipped
  in cold water.  Raise heat slightly and cook until temperature of
  syrup reaches 240 F (soft ball stage).  While syrup is cooking, beat 3
  egg whites in a mixer until stiff.  As soon as syrup reaches 240 F,
  lower mixer speed to slow and pour hot syrup onto beaten whites, in a
  very thing stream.  When all of the syrup has been incorporated, raise
  a mixer speed and beat meringue until cool.
  
       Stir together the 1/2 cup reserved raspberry puree and lemon
  juice and fold into the meringue until nearly blended.  Whip cream
  until stiff and fold into the meringue until blended.  DO NOT OVERMIX.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Spread 3/4-inch layer of mousse in prepared souffle dish.
  Carefully peel off the paper from a meringue layer and place the layer
  on top.  Repeat, adding 3/4-inch layer of mousse, then remaining
  meringue layer.  Top with remaining mousse, smoothing it gently with
  spatula.  Freeze at least 3 hours.
  
       To serve, carefully remove paper collar.  Smooth exposed edge of
  souffle, if necessary, with a metal spatula.  Use a knife blade or
  long metal spatula to score shallow crisscross pattern in top of
  souffle.  Garnish with reserved raspberries.  Serve in wedges,
  spooning a little of the chilled raspberry puree around each portion
  and serving remainder separately.

       ** If you have previously prepared Veal Stock - the simplest thing to
  do is to take a 1/2 cup of the veal stock and boil it until it reduces to
  about 2 tablespoons and takes on the consistency of thick syrup.  If you
  don't have Veal Stock handy, then you follow this recipe to make the stock
  first.
  
       Preheat oven to 450 F.
  
       Put the oil in a roasting pan and heat briefly in the oven.
  
       Add the bones to the oil in the pan, toss to coat and roast for
  35 minutes.
  
       Add the onions, carrots, celery, leek, garlic and parsley,
  tossing them all to coat with fat.  Roast 30 minutes longer.
  
       Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the bones and
  vegetables to a clean stockpot.  Drain off as much of the fat as
  possible.
  
       Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat (use 2 burners if
  neces-) (sary), and add 2 cups of cold water and boil briefly.  Scrape
  up all of the browned bits into the water.
  
       Transfer the liquid to the stock pot and add enough cold water to
  cover.  Bring slowly to a boil, skimming off all of the froth that
  forms.
  
       Lower the heat and add tomatoes, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and
  salt.  Simmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours adding water as necessary
  just to cover the ingredients.  Skim whenever necessary.
  
       Add peppercorns for the last 15 minutes of the simmering.
  
       Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through a colander lined with
  a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gently press the solids to
  extract all of the liquid, and discard the solids.
  
       Pour the stock into containers for storage and label and date
  them.
  
       The stock will "keep" for up to 3 days in a refrigerator, and up
  to 6 months in a freezer.
  
       This stock is now used to make the Glaze as noted in the beginning of
  these directions.

  fold until blended.  Pour the mixture over the honey-almond layer in the
  springform mold, smoothing the top with a spatula.  Freeze for several
  hours or overnight.
  
  For Raspberry Sauce:
  ====================
  
       In a saucepan, combine all of the sauce ingredients except lemon
  juice. Bring to a boil, then boil gently, stirring, for about 7 minutes.
  Reduce the heat and stir in the lemon juice.  Keep warm.
  
       To garnish, remove parfait from freezer.  Carefully release
  springform ring (if difficult, warm ring slightly with your palms).
  Whip 1/2 cup cream until stiff; form decorative border or rosettes
  around the top and bottom edges of the parfait by piping whipped cream
  through a pastry bag fitted with a star tip.  Arrange 2 raspberries and 2
  or 3 almond slices on top of each serving.  Cut into wedges.  Serve with
  warm raspberry sauce, if desired.

      1 md Onion, chopped                           -- (optional)
      1 pn Nutmeg, ground                 
 
  For Pastry:
  ===========
  
       In a mixing bowl or processor, combine the flour, the salt, and
  sugar.  Cut in 1/2 cup of butter until crumbly.  Add just enough cold
  water so that they dough holds together in a ball.  Seal in plastic
  wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
  
  For Filling:
  ============
  
       Working in small batches, blanch the Swiss chard in boiling
  salted water.  Drain, rinse under cold water, and thoroughly squeeze
  dry.  Chop the chard finely and set aside.
  
       Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and oil in a large skillet.  Add
  chilies, garlic, ginger and saute over medium heat for 1 minute
  without browning.  Add the onion, and cook with stirring until
  translucent.  Add the nutmeg, cumin and thyme and cook 1 minute
  longer.  Add Swiss chard and stir until completely dry.  Remove from
  heat, season to taste with lemon juice and salt, and set aside.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a very
  large circle 1/4 inch thick.  Fold into quarters and carefully
  transfer the dough to a buttered 9-inch springform pan.  Unfold the
  dough and gently fit it into the bottom of the pan, leaving a generous
  overhang.  Brush the bottom and sides with some of the egg yolk
  mixture and set aside to dry for about 10 minutes.
  
       Preheat oven to 375 F. Spread half of the Swiss chard filling
  over the dough and arrange fish fillets on top.  Cover evenly with
  remaining Swiss chard.  Gently gather up the edges of the dough in the
  center, and twist it into a topknot, pinching the knot with thumb and
  forefinger.  Leaving a knot 2 to 3 inches high, cut off the excess
  dough.  Brush with the remaining egg yolk mixture and sprinkle with
  mustard seeds, and cut several slashes around the top.
  
       Place on a baking sheet and bake until golden, 1 to 1 1/4 hours.
  Cool completely on a rack before removing sides of the pan.  Cut into
  wedges and serve at room temperature.

  a processor with the olive oil, fresh chilies, and garlic.  Process
  until smooth.  With the machine running, add 1/2 cup of walnuts, 1/2
  cup reserved pepper soaking liquid and 2 tablespoons of salt.  Process
  until smooth.  Add half of the crumbled cheese and process until
  smooth.  Transfer to a small bowl.  Coarsely chop the remaining
  walnuts and add them to the mixture with the remaining cheese; salt
  and pepper to taste.
  
       Shape potato mixture into about 2 dozen 1 1/2-inch balls.
  Arrange them on a bed of lettuce leaves, spooning a little sauce on
  top.  Garnish with eggs, corn, coriander and olives.  Serve at room

      Title:  Crema de Laurel
 Categories: Masterchefs, New york, Rltbr
      Yield: 1 servings
 
----------------------------------CARAMEL----------------------------------
      1 c  Sugar                               1 ea Bay leaf
    1/4 c  Water                               3 ea Cloves, whole

----------------------------------CUSTARD----------------------------------
      8 ea Egg yolks                           1 tb Amaretto OR
      2 ea Eggs                                1 tb Sherry, sweet
      1 c  Sugar                               1 c  Cream, whipping
      4 c  Milk                                1 ea Bay leaf
 
  For Caramel:
  ============
  
       Combine the ingredients in a small, heavy saucepan.  Bring the
  mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally and brushing
  down any sugar crystals from the side of the pan with a brush dipped in
  cold water.  Continue to cook, without stirring, until syrup turns a
  medium amber color.
  
       Immediately strain caramel (reserving the bay leaf) into a
  12 x 4 1/2 x 4-inch terrine or 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.  Swirl rapidly to
  coat the bottom and sides.  Invert the mold over parchment paper or
  waxed paper.  Cool.
  
  For Custard:
  ============
  
       Preheat the oven to 375 F. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together
  the egg yolks, eggs, sugar, and amaretto until pale and light, about 3
  minutes.  Gently whisk in the milk and cream.  Strain into the mold and
  place the mold in a roasting pan.  Put the pan on the center rack of the
  oven and place a bay leaf in the center of the custard.  Add enough hot
  water to the roasting pan to come 1.3 of the way up the outside of the
  mold.  Bake until just set, about 1 1/2 hours ( the 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf
  pan may take slightly longer.) Remove from the water bath and cool to
  room temperature on a rack.  Refrigerate if desired.  Place reserved
  caramelized bay leaf on top, slightly overlapping baked leaf.  Serve
  cold or at room temperature.

      Title:  Salmon Rillettes
 Categories: Casseroles, Seafood, Masterchefs, New york, Tfs
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 x  Court Bouillon **             

-----------------------------------SALMON-----------------------------------
    3/4 lb Salmon, fillets or steaks,          1 c  Butter, unsalted, softened
           -- fresh, trimmed, skin on          1 tb Armagnac
      1 tb Salt, sea                         3/4 lb Salmon, smoked, trimmed, and
    1/2 ts Peppercorns, whole                       -- cut into shreds
      1 sm Chili, dried                        4 oz Roe, salmon

--------------------------------TOAST STRIPS--------------------------------
           Oil, olive                               -- trimmed, each slice cut
      1 ea Bread, white, loaf, sliced               -- into 3 long strips
           -- 3/4-inch thick, crusts      
 
       ** See recipe for Court Bouillon.
  
       Bring the Court Bouillon to a boil in a skillet.  Add the salmon
  and lower the heat to simmer.  Place a sheet of buttered parchment
  paper or aluminum foil, buttered side down, over the salmon.  Poach
  until the fish is just opaque in the center, (about 8 minutes), or
  about 10 minutes per inch of thickness; DO NOT OVERCOOK.  Remove from
  the heat and cool salmon completely in the broth.
  
       To make up a seasoning mixture, use a small spice or coffee mill
  to grind the sea salt, 1/2 teaspoon peppercorns and chili.
  
       Drain the poached salmon, remove its skin, and cut it into
  1/2-inch pieces.  Place the salmon pieces, butter, Armagnac and a
  pinch of the seasoning mixture into a processor and blend it all into
  a very smooth puree.  Add the shredded smoked salmon to the processor
  and process with rapid on and off pulses just until the mixture is
  blended.  There should be visible shreds of smoked salmon.  Transfer
  the mixture to a mixing bowl.
  
       Gently fold salmon roe into the mixture until blended, taking
  care not to crush the eggs.  Adjust the seasoning.  Spoon mixture into
  a 4-cup souffle dish, straight-sided gratin dish, or casserole,
  lightly tapping mold on towel lined work surface to eliminate any air
  bubbles.  Cover the dish with a plastic wrap and chill.  (The Court
  Bouillon can be prepared 1 or 2 days ahead.)
  
  For Toast Strips:
  =================
  
       Preheat oven to 325 F. Rub a baking sheet with a thin film of
  olive oil.  Arrange the bread strips on the baking sheet and bake them
  on the center rack of the oven, without turning, until lightly golden
  (15 to 20 minutes.)
  
       Remove the rillettes from the refrigerator 20 minutes before
  serving.  Dip the serving spoon in cold water and scoop onto cool
  plates.  Serve with warm toast strips.

      2 lg Carrots, peeled, chopped           10 c  Stock, Chicken **
    1/2 md Cabbage, head, savoy, cored,        3 c  Cream, whipping
           -- coarsely chopped                      Salt (to taste)
      2 md Potatoes, baking, peeled and             Pepper (to taste)

      2 md Turnips, white, peeled                   Chives, fresh, chopped,
           -- chopped                               -- (garnish)
 
       ** See recipes for Chicken Stock.
  
       In a large saucepan or casserole, heat up the butter over
  medium-low heat.  Add the onion, leek, celery, garlic and jalapeno
  chili.  Cook, covered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
       Add the carrots, cabbage, potatoes, turnips, fennel, kohlrabi,
  celery root, broccoli, parsley, and enough stock to nearly cover.
  Bring the contents to a boil; lower heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30
  minutes or until very tender.
  
       Puree the soup, working in batches as necessary, in a processor
  or blender.  Rinse out the pan, pour the soup back into the saucepan,
  and bring the soup to a simmer.  Add cream and salt and pepper to
  taste; heat back up to simmer.  Serve with garnish of sour cream and
  chives.
  
  NOTE:
  =====
  
       At Thanksgiving dinner at The Four Seasons, this soup is served in
  a hollowed-out acorn squash.  To serve it this way, slice off the tops
  and a thin sliver from the bottom of the acorn squash (this is so the
  squash can "sit up" on its own) then hollow out the insides.
  
       Pour in the finished soup and bake on a baking sheet, uncovered,
  at 375 F until the squash is tender, about 30 minutes.  The squash
  will be tender enough to be scraped from the shell and eaten with the
  soup.
  
       The vegetables in this soup can be varied according to what is
  in season, as long as you maintain the proportion of solids to liquid.

      Title:  Roast Quail with Juniper Berries I (Polenta)
 Categories: Starches, Masterchefs, New york, Tfs
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 c  Milk                                     -- crumbled PLUS 6 thin
      3 tb Butter, unsalted                         -- 1-inch square slices
    3/4 c  Cornmeal                          1/3 c  Raisins, golden
      3 tb Cream, sour                              Nutmeg, fresh, ground
  2 1/2 tb Cheese, Gruyere, grated                  Salt (to taste)
  2 1/2 tb Cheese, Parmesan, grated                 Pepper (to taste)
    1/3 c  Cheese, Gorgonzola,                      Breadcrumbs, fine
 
       In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the milk and butter to a
  boil.  Add the cornmeal in a thin stream, whisking constantly.  When
  mixture becomes very thick, continue to boil while stirring constantly
  with a wooden spoon, until very thick and smooth (about 5 minutes.)
  
       Stir in the sour cream, grated Gruyere, Parmesan, crumbled
  Gorgonzola, raisins, and a little nutmeg, beating until smooth.
  Remove from heat; add salt and pepper to taste.
  
       Spoon the cornmeal mixture into 6 1/2-cup ramekins, or custard
  cups, tapping molds gently on work surface to settle mixture, and
  smoothing tops with spatula.  Cool at least 15 minutes.
  
       Use a knife to loosen polenta from ramekins and unmold onto a
  generously buttered baking dish.  Place a slice of Gorgonzola on top
  of each; sprinkle with a fine layer of breadcrumbs.  Bake in 450 F
  oven (along with quail, if desired) for 10 to 12 minutes, then broil
  just until lightly golden.  Serve immediately.

      Title:  Roast Quail with Juniper Berries II (Relish)
 Categories: Relishes, Masterchefs, New york, Tfs
      Yield: 6 cups
 
      1 lg Orange, navel                       1 ea Vanilla, bean, split
      1 ea Lime                                     -- lengthwise
      1 tb Ginger, fresh, grated               2 c  Sugar
      2 ea Cinnamon, sticks                    1 c  Raisins
      1 ea Chili, dried                        2 lb Cranberries, fresh
 
       Cut the orange and lime, with their skins, into a 1/4-inch dice.
  Set aside.
  
       Tie the ginger, cinnamon sticks, chili and vanilla bean in
  cheesecloth and set aside.
  
       Place the sugar in a heavy large skillet, preferably one with
  straight sides.  Stir constantly over high heat until sugar turns
  light amber.  The sugar must be cooked carefully to prevent burning;
  break up lumps as you go.  (If there are still lumps of sugar after it
  begins to color, work over low heat, or off heat, until mixture is
  smooth.)
  
       Stir in the orange, the lime and the bag of spices, and cook over
  high heat, stirring constantly for 5 minutes.  Fold in the raisins and
  cranberries, stirring gently to coat with caramelized sugar.  Cook
  over medium heat, stirring gently, until about half of the cranberries
  pop open, about 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and cool.
  
       Remove the bag of spices and spoon the relish into sterilized
  jars.  Cover tightly and refrigerate for 1 month.  This relish keeps
  about 3 months.

           -- coarsely chopped OR                   Pepper (to taste)
      6 sl Bacon, coarsely chopped           1/4 c  Gin
     12 ea Sage, leaves, fresh OR            1/2 c  Wine, white, dry
    1/2 ts Sage, dried                         2 c  Stock, Veal **
    1/4 c  Oil, olive                     
 
       ** See recipe for Veal Stock, Gorgonzola Polenta, and Cranberry
  Relish.
  
       Preheat your oven to 450 F. Holding quail, breast up, tuck wing
  tips under.  Place a little of the pancetta, a sage leaf, and 2
  juniper berries in the cavity of each bird.  Sprinkle the cavity and
  outside of each bird with a little salt and pepper.  Push each leg
  joint downward and fasten it to the carcass with a toothpick, pushing
  1 toothpick through both legs.
  
       Heat the olive oil in a large heavy skillet over very high heat.
  Arrange birds in pan, breasts down.  Saute, shaking pan occasionally
  until breasts are lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes.  Place the skillet
  in the oven and roast 5 to 6 minutes.  Use tongs to turn birds'
  breasts up and continue to roast until golden brown, about 6 minutes.
  Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the quail to 6 warm
  serving plates; keep warm while preparing sauce.
  
       Discard any fat from the skillet and place the pan over
  medium-high heat.  Deglaze the skillet, adding the gin and wine,
  scraping up any browned bits in a pan.  Add your stock and boil gently
  until reduced enough to coat a spoon lightly.  Stir in the remaining
  juniper berries, adjust your seasonings, and pour this over the birds.
  Serve immediately.

      1 tb Rum, dark                           3 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Extract, vanilla                    2 tb Cocoa, unsweetened
    1/4 ts Cream of Tartar                 2 1/2 oz Amaretti (about 10 Italian
      8 tb Sugar                                    -- macaroons), finely
     12 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet,                   -- ground
           -- melted                     

------------------------------CHOCOLATE CREAM------------------------------
      4 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet,              2 c  Cream, whipping
           -- melted                           2 tb Rum, dark
    1/2 c  Water, hot                     
 
       * For chocolate leaves, brush melted chocolate on undersides of
  holly or lemon leaves; refrigerate until firm, carefully peel off
  leaves.
  
  For Cake:
  =========
  
       Preheat oven to 375 F. Butter and flour 3 9-inch round cake pans.
  
       Beat yolks until they are pale yellow and form a ribbon when
  beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes.  Beat in rum and vanilla.
  
       Beat whites with cream of tartar to soft peaks.  Add sugar 1
  tablespoon at a time and continue beating until stiff and shiny.
  
       Stir 12 ounces of semisweet chocolate and butter into yolks until
  well combined.  Gently fold in 1/4 of egg whites to lighten the
  batter, then gently fold in the remaining whites.
  
      Sift together cornstarch and cocoa; combine with ground amaretti.,
  Gently fold into the batter.
  
       Divide batter among prepared pans.  Bake until centers of cakes
  rise and tops begin to crack, 18 to 20 minutes.  Cool 10 minutes in
  pans, then cool completely on wire rack (cakes will fall slightly.)
  
  For Chocolate Cream:
  ====================
  
       Whisk together 4 ounces of semisweet chocolate and hot water;
  cool to room temperature.  Whip cream until nearly stiff.  Gently fold
  chocolate mixture and rum into whipped cream.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Set aside 1/4 of the chocolate cream for decorating the top of
  the cake.  Spread remainder evenly between the 3 layers, stacking them
  neatly, then spread over the reserved cream over the top and sides.
  
       Measure height of the cake.  On a sheet of parchment or waxed
  paper, spread 3 ounces melted semisweet chocolate into rectangle
  1/16-inch-thick and as wide as the cake is high.  Repeat with melted
  white chocolate on another sheet of parchment.  Refrigerate until
  chocolate is firm but not brittle, about 15 minutes.  Cut chocolate
  crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide strips.  Refrigerate to refirm chocolate,
  about 15 minutes.
  
       Carefully arrange strips alternately around edges of cake, gently
  pressing into icing.  Spoon reserved chocolate cream into pastry bag
  fitted with a no.  3 round tip.  Pipe mixture into straight lines atop
  the cake.  Dust lightly with cocoa;' refrigerate.  Garnish with
  chocolate leaves.  Bring to room temperature before serving.

  The Pheasant:
  =============
  
       With a sharp boning knife, carefully remove each breast half from
  the pheasants and set aside.  Remove the legs with thighs attached.
  To bone each leg-thigh portion, use a sharp boning or paring knife to
  slit the leg and thigh meat, cutting parallel to the bones.  Carefully
  scrape thigh meat away from the bone.  Cut through the joint between
  the leg and thigh, keeping meat in 1 piece.  Scrape away all remaining
  thigh meat and cut or pull out thighbone.
  
       Use a cleaver to cut off the knob end of the leg.  Scrape meat from
  the gone and pull out the bone.
  
       Refrigerate meat, covered.  Reserve bones and carcasses for the
  next recipe Pheasant Stock.

      Title:  Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage VI (Assembly)
 Categories: Game, Masterchefs, New york, V79
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Pheasants **                             Pheasant Sauce **
           Pheasant Stock **                        Champagne Cabbage **
           Mousseline Stuffing **              6 tb Butter, clarified **
 
       ** See recipes for Clarified Butter, Pheasant with Champagne
  Cabbage I (Stock), Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage II (Stuffing),
  Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage III (Sauce), Pheasant with Champagne
  Cabbage IV (Pheasant), and Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage V (Cabbage).
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Place the leg-thigh portions of the Pheasants, skin side down and
  short ends toward yourself between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; flatten
  gently with a mallet or side of a cleaver.
  
       Spread about 1/3 cup of stuffing on each portion and fold meat over
  to form a 1/2-inch border on each of the 2 long sides.
  
       Starting with a short side, roll the stuffing and meat into a
  neat cylinder.  Use kitchen twine to tie compactly, wrapping twine
  around once lengthwise and 3 times crosswise.  Chill, covered, until
  firm (at least 30 minutes.)
  
       Preheat oven to 450 F.
  
       Heat 6 tablespoons of clarified butter in a large oven-proof
  skillet.
  
       Salt and pepper the stuffed leg packages and saute, shaking pan
  occasionally, until golden on all sides (about 4 minutes.) Place
  skillet in oven and roast for 4 minutes.
  
       Return skillet to the top of stove over medium-high heat.  Add
  breast halves to the pan, skin side up, and sprinkle with salt and
  pepper.  Saute for 2 minutes, shaking pan occasionally.
  
       Turn breasts skin side down, sprinkle with salt and pepper and
  return to the oven until everything is tender (about 7 minutes.)
  
       Transfer meat to work surface.  Cut leg-thigh portions crosswise
  into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Thinly slice breasts lengthwise on a
  diagonal.
  
  To Serve:
  =========
  
       Mound about 1/2 cup of cabbage in the center of each of 4 warmed
  serving plates.  Place leg-thigh slices around bottom of each plate,
  overlapping slightly.  Place breast slices in a fan pattern at top of
  each plate, overlapping slightly.  Spoon some sauce around the meat and
  cabbage; serve the rest of the sauce separately.

       Preheat oven to 450 F. Place 4 shallow 9-inch oval gratin dishes
  on a baking sheet.  In each, put 1 teaspoon of jelly, 1 tablespoon of
  cream and 1 piece of butter.
  
       In a mixer, beat the egg whites on medium-high speed until they
  form soft peaks.  Gradually add vanilla sugar and lemon juice and
  continue to beat until stiff and shiny.

  mixture to each of the baking dishes; shape and smooth them.  Bake
  until puffed and golden (about 8 minutes.)
